749476,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00008YGRT,A. Burchfield,"[0, 0]","I think that this one of the best of the four seasons. After First season's destruction of Angel Investigations original offices the gang moves into new headquarters, an old derelict hotel Angel once lived in(great looking set). You'll get a story or two about that, pretty good although they could've gone into some more detail (A woman Angel knew there in the 50's left a suitcase full of money, you never hear of it again).I liked the Darla/Drusilla story segments the best, those ladies did a good job. I didn't like the Wolfram &amp; Hart bits, very dissatisfying. Elisabeth Rohm was largely wasted this season (her second &amp; I guess final)no wonder she's gone now. Another example of how the series can introduce something or someone an just unceremoniously dump them when it doesn't work well, this actress could do things if they'd written anything for her.Just three guest bits this season, one with Mercedes McNabb as Harmony, that episode wasn't bad although Alyson Hannigan's appearance didn't amount to much. Alyson's end of season appearance with news of Buffy's death was way too short.The last three (4?) episodes of the season were just plain weird, I dind't mind learning more about the Host's (later known as Lorne) homeworld but didn't care for the story arc.

What really made season two great, at least for the first half of the season, was Julie Benz's tragically wonderful performance as Angel's sire, Darla.  Not only did the character grow and become more than just a vampire killer, we got to learn more of the background behind hers and Angel's tempestuous relationship; including how Darla was sired by The Master. This was also a really great season for the supporting players, Cordelia and Wesley most of all.  An of course we can't forget Andy Hallett's tour de force performance as the Host, Lorne.

749479,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00008YGRT,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[4, 4]","While the first season of Angel was very good, this season completely blew its predecessor out of the water.  It starts off with Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia (Charisma Carpentar), and Wesley (Alexis Denisof), and eventually Gunn (J. August Richards), trying to figure out what Wolfram and Hart summoned in the box in the season 1 finale.  They all think its some hell-beast, but it turns out to be Darla (Julie Benz), Angel's sire.  The lawyers at W&amp;H plan on using her to drive Angel insane and make him turn back into Angelus.  This season, we are introduced to Lorne the Host (Andy Hallet) and Fred (Amy Acker), two great characters destined to end up in the opening credits.  Anyway, once Angel realizes that Darla is back in human form, he makes it his mission to save her soul, for he thinks that if he takes pity on the person that made him a vampire, it will earn him big points in his mission to become human again.  Unfortunately, Drusilla (Juliet Landau) comes to L.A. to turn Darla back into a vampire.  Outraged, Angel fires his three companions and becomes a scary mixture of Angel and Angelus.  While still retaining his soul, he begins to do anything and everything to kill Darla and destroy Wolfram and Hart.  Eventually, a trip to the &quot;Home Office&quot; is the shock required to bring back Angel and reunite with his friends.  Towards the end of the season, the gang ends up in Pylea, an alternate universe where Lorne came from.  There, they meet Fred and change the way of the world.This show has a lot more &quot;gray&quot; than its sister show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which makes for some very good plot-lines.  For example, in &quot;The Thin Dead Line&quot;, a police captain raised some cops from the dead as ruthless zombies to help fight crime.  While what he did was wrong, and the cops violated many of our rights as Americans, they did their job very well.  They were in a precinct with daily crime.  Also, Angel's whole descent was very gray; his sacrificed principles were merely a means to an end, which would have significantly decreased the evil in the world.  However, when the gang got to Pylea, things took on a whole new spin, because, according to Lorne, there is no gray in Pylea.  Just black and white.  This proved very true, especially in Angel's human/demon relationship.  He was very human in Pylea; he had a reflection and could walk in the sunlight.  However, when he fought and tried to shift to his vampire face, his entire body changed into a grotesque demon that he could barely control.I guess that the only change that I would make is (WARNING: Spoiler) the way they returned to Los Angeles.  The characters were saying that going to Pylea could have been a one-way trip.  I thought that they wouldn't be able to open a portal back to L.A., but instead, they would be brought back because of the vortex opened by Glory and Doc in Sunnydale.  They would end up there and see Buffy's (Sarah Michelle Gellar) body rather than a have a silent Willow (Alyson Hannigan) waiting for them at their hotel.This was a great season, and I can't wait for the next one to come out.  Some good episodes are Disharmony, Belonging, Over the Rainbow, Through the Looking Glass, There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb, Guise Will Be Guise, Reunion, Redefinition, Reprise, and Epiphany.",5,Fallen/Lost Angel,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,3329,"['first', 'season', 'Angel', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'season', 'completely', 'blew', 'predecessor', 'water', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpentar', 'Wesley', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'eventually', 'Gunn', 'J.', 'August', 'Richards', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'summoned', 'box', 'season', '1', 'finale', 'think', 'hell-beast', 'out', 'be', 'Darla', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'Angel', 'sire', 'lawyers', 'W', 'amp', 'H', 'plan', 'using', 'drive', 'Angel', 'insane', 'make', 'turn', 'back', 'Angelus', 'season', 'are', 'introduced', 'Lorne', 'Host', 'Andy', 'Hallet', 'Fred', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'two', 'great', 'characters', 'destined', 'end', 'up', 'opening', 'credits', 'Anyway', 'once', 'Angel', 'Darla', 'back', 'human', 'form', 'mission', 'save', 'soul', 'pity', 'person', 'made', 'vampire', 'will', 'earn', 'big', 'points', 'mission', 'become', 'human', 'again', 'Unfortunately', 'Drusilla', 'Juliet', 'Landau', 'L.A.', 'turn', 'Darla', 'back', 'vampire', 'Outraged', 'Angel', 'three', 'companions', 'scary', 'mixture', 'Angel', 'Angelus', 'still', 'retaining', 'soul', 'do', 'anything', 'everything', 'kill', 'Darla', 'destroy', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'Eventually', 'trip', 'quot', 'Home', 'Office', 'quot', 'shock', 'required', 'bring', 'back', 'Angel', 'reunite', 'friends', 'end', 'season', 'gang', 'up', 'Pylea', 'alternate', 'universe', 'where', 'Lorne', 'came', 'meet', 'Fred', 'change', 'way', 'world.This', 'show', 'lot', 'more', 'quot', 'gray', 'quot', 'sister', 'show', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'very', 'good', 'plot-lines', 'example', 'quot', 'Thin', 'Dead', 'Line', 'quot', 'police', 'captain', 'raised', 'cops', 'dead', 'ruthless', 'zombies', 'help', 'fight', 'crime', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'wrong', 'cops', 'violated', 'many', 'rights', 'Americans', 'did', 'job', 'very', 'well', 'were', 'precinct', 'daily', 'crime', 'Also', 'Angel', 'whole', 'descent', 'was', 'very', 'gray', 'sacrificed', 'principles', 'were', 'merely', 'means', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'significantly', 'decreased', 'evil', 'world', 'However', 'when', 'gang', 'got', 'Pylea', 'things', 'took', 'whole', 'new', 'spin', 'according', 'Lorne', 'gray', 'Pylea', 'Just', 'black', 'white', 'proved', 'very', 'true', 'especially', 'Angel', 'human/demon', 'relationship', 'was', 'very', 'human', 'Pylea', 'had', 'reflection', 'could', 'walk', 'sunlight', 'However', 'when', 'fought', 'tried', 'shift', 'vampire', 'face', 'entire', 'body', 'changed', 'grotesque', 'demon', 'could', 'barely', 'control.I', 'guess', 'only', 'change', 'would', 'make', 'WARNING', 'Spoiler', 'way', 'returned', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'characters', 'were', 'saying', 'going', 'Pylea', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one-way', 'trip', 'thought', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'open', 'portal', 'back', 'L.A.', 'instead', 'would', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'vortex', 'opened', 'Glory', 'Doc', 'Sunnydale', 'would', 'end', 'there', 'see', 'Buffy', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'body', 'rather', 'have', 'silent', 'Willow', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'waiting', 'hotel.This', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'one', 'come', 'out', 'good', 'episodes', 'are', 'Disharmony', 'Belonging', 'Rainbow', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'Place', 'Plrtz', 'Glrb', 'Guise', 'Will', 'Be', 'Guise', 'Reunion', 'Redefinition', 'Reprise', 'Epiphany']",Angel - Season Two
749480,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B00008YGRT,Annie Feng,"[1, 2]","This season is much more complex than season one. It showed brilliantly that the supernatural elements in Angel are only channels and doors to the revelation of the real, human world. The Darla sequence was fabulously done, and Angel's moral development was credible. in fact, the Darla sequence is this season's strength.On the way of seeking redemption Angel renunited with the human Darla. Angel thought if he could save her he would save himself.because Darla is experiencing the same thing Angel does- a second chance to redemption. But when Darla was once again turned into a Vampire, and Angel was being shown that the real hell is exactly where he is, he lost all hope of saving himself and seeking redemption. He became darker and darker by this realization and given up and had sex with Darla- the most brilliant plot in many different aspects: Darla used this moment to get rid of Angel's soul- the thing she finds most disgusting, in another view, Darla was going to kill Angel but didn't have to since Angel completely gave himself to her. Angel used Darla as a prostitude, he didn't care whether he will lose his soul or not and in a way he wanted to lose it and given in to the darkness. But when he woke up he realized that Darla had ""saved"" him by giving him the deepest despire instead of perfect happiness because it was despire that led Angel to sex with Darla. The sex between Angel and Darla was completely meaningless. Unlike the sex between Angel and Buffy, in which Angel achieved perfect happiness because he was happy with himself. On the other hand the sex between him and Darla was pure emptiness. Angel was completely in a ""trance"", even stupidity of the things happening between him and Darla. This sequence showed the irony of sex- genuine love sex makes Angel lose his soul, yet empty sex saves him. Thus Angel received epiphany- the realization of how deep he has fallen into darkness and began to comprehend a whole different view of him playing the hero- the revelation that he used to save people only to serve his self-matter, the desire of redemption ( which is the sole cause to his darkness and despire when he realized he might never recieve them, that the world is controlled by evil and good will never prevail)- to believing that he should just help people and save people for the people, not for himself. The most touching quotes of Angel:Kate: &iexcl;I feel like such an idiot.&iexcl;Angel: &iexcl;Lotta that going around.&iexcl;Kate: &iexcl;I just couldn't... my whole life has been about being a cop. If I'm not part of the force... it's like nothing I do means anything.Angel: &iexcl;It doesn't.""Kate: &iexcl;Doesn't what?&iexcl;Angel: &iexcl;Mean anything. In the greater scheme, the big picture, nothing we do matters. There's no grand plan, no big win.&iexcl;Kate: &iexcl;You seem kind of chipper about that.&iexcl;Angel: &iexcl;Well, I guess I kind of worked it out. If there's no great glorious end to all this, if nothing we do matters... then all that matters is what we do. 'Cause that's all there is. What we do. Now. Today. I fought for so long, for redemption, for a reward, and finally just to beat the other guy. I never got it.Kate: &iexcl;And now you do?&iexcl;Angel: &iexcl;Not all of it. But now I just wanna help. I wanna help because people shouldn't suffer as they do. Because, if there isn't any bigger meaning, then the smallest act of kindness is the greatest thing in the world.&iexcl;however, this season's flaw lies in the 4 part season finale. it was completely meaningless and a bad choice for a season finale. the point of it was to bring Fred into the show. but they really should've done it maybe before the season finale. however, it is enjoyable to watch.Overall: definitely deserves 5 star. This is the first season of Angel that shows the complexcy of the show and the brilliancy of Joss Whedon, the writer for creating it- that Angel is not another dump soap opera, but something that is deep and reveals the human world in its supernatural way.",5,Angel's epiphany,1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,4031,"['season', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'season', 'one', 'showed', 'brilliantly', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'Angel', 'are', 'only', 'channels', 'doors', 'revelation', 'real', 'human', 'world', 'Darla', 'sequence', 'was', 'fabulously', 'done', 'Angel', 'moral', 'development', 'was', 'credible', 'fact', 'Darla', 'sequence', 'season', 'strength.On', 'way', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'Angel', 'renunited', 'human', 'Darla', 'Angel', 'thought', 'could', 'save', 'would', 'save', 'himself.because', 'Darla', 'experiencing', 'same', 'thing', 'Angel', 'does-', 'second', 'chance', 'redemption', 'when', 'Darla', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'turned', 'Vampire', 'Angel', 'was', 'being', 'shown', 'real', 'hell', 'exactly', 'where', 'lost', 'hope', 'saving', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'became', 'darker', 'darker', 'realization', 'given', 'up', 'had', 'sex', 'Darla-', 'most', 'brilliant', 'plot', 'many', 'different', 'aspects', 'Darla', 'used', 'moment', 'get', 'rid', 'Angel', 'soul-', 'thing', 'most', 'disgusting', 'view', 'Darla', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'Angel', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Angel', 'completely', 'gave', 'Angel', 'used', 'Darla', 'prostitude', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'will', 'lose', 'soul', 'not', 'way', 'wanted', 'lose', 'given', 'darkness', 'when', 'woke', 'up', 'realized', 'Darla', 'had', 'saved', 'giving', 'deepest', 'despire', 'instead', 'perfect', 'happiness', 'was', 'despire', 'led', 'Angel', 'sex', 'Darla', 'sex', 'Angel', 'Darla', 'was', 'completely', 'meaningless', 'sex', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'achieved', 'perfect', 'happiness', 'was', 'happy', 'other', 'hand', 'sex', 'Darla', 'was', 'pure', 'emptiness', 'Angel', 'was', 'completely', 'trance', 'even', 'stupidity', 'things', 'happening', 'Darla', 'sequence', 'showed', 'irony', 'sex-', 'genuine', 'love', 'sex', 'Angel', 'lose', 'soul', 'yet', 'empty', 'sex', 'Thus', 'Angel', 'received', 'epiphany-', 'realization', 'how', 'deep', 'fallen', 'darkness', 'began', 'comprehend', 'whole', 'different', 'view', 'playing', 'hero-', 'revelation', 'used', 'save', 'people', 'only', 'serve', 'self-matter', 'desire', 'redemption', 'sole', 'cause', 'darkness', 'despire', 'when', 'realized', 'might', 'never', 'recieve', 'world', 'controlled', 'evil', 'good', 'will', 'never', 'prevail', 'believing', 'should', 'just', 'help', 'people', 'save', 'people', 'people', 'not', 'most', 'touching', 'quotes', 'Angel', 'Kate', 'iexcl', 'feel', 'idiot.', 'iexcl', 'Angel', 'iexcl', 'Lotta', 'going', 'around.', 'iexcl', 'Kate', 'iexcl', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'whole', 'life', 'been', 'being', 'cop', ""'m"", 'not', 'part', 'force', 'nothing', 'do', 'means', 'anything.Angel', 'iexcl', ""n't"", 'Kate', 'iexcl', ""n't"", 'what', 'iexcl', 'Angel', 'iexcl', 'Mean', 'anything', 'greater', 'scheme', 'big', 'picture', 'nothing', 'do', 'matters', 'grand', 'plan', 'big', 'win.', 'iexcl', 'Kate', 'iexcl', 'seem', 'kind', 'chipper', 'that.', 'iexcl', 'Angel', 'iexcl', 'Well', 'guess', 'kind', 'worked', 'out', 'great', 'glorious', 'end', 'nothing', 'do', 'matters', 'then', 'matters', 'what', 'do', ""'Cause"", 'What', 'do', 'Now', 'Today', 'fought', 'so', 'long', 'redemption', 'reward', 'finally', 'just', 'beat', 'other', 'guy', 'never', 'got', 'it.Kate', 'iexcl', 'now', 'do', 'iexcl', 'Angel', 'iexcl', 'Not', 'now', 'just', 'wan', 'help', 'wan', 'na', 'help', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'do', ""n't"", 'bigger', 'meaning', 'then', 'smallest', 'act', 'kindness', 'greatest', 'thing', 'world.', 'iexcl', 'however', 'season', 'flaw', '4', 'part', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'completely', 'meaningless', 'bad', 'choice', 'season', 'finale', 'point', 'was', 'bring', 'Fred', 'show', 'really', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', 'maybe', 'season', 'finale', 'however', 'enjoyable', 'watch.Overall', 'definitely', '5', 'star', 'first', 'season', 'Angel', 'complexcy', 'show', 'brilliancy', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'writer', 'creating', 'it-', 'Angel', 'not', 'dump', 'soap', 'opera', 'something', 'deep', 'human', 'world', 'supernatural', 'way']",Angel - Season Two
749481,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00008YGRT,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[43, 50]","The best thing you can say about the second season of this wonderful show, is that after it's first season, the show finally found it's footing here. The first year was very good, but didn't quite yet know what exactly it was. The second season is stronger in that area. Personally, I liked the first season better. We are off to a rolicking start with ""Judgment"", and then the classic episode, ""Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been"". A flashback episode that details Angel in the 1950's staying at the Hyperion Hotel, amid a number of colorful characters. This hotel also becomes the setting for the show. Darla is back. She has been resurrected by evil law firm Wolfram And Hart. The plan for Darla is for her to toy with Angel and to lure him back into being Angelus. ""Dear Boy"" is the first episode where that arc really kicks in. Where Angel finds out, after seeing Darla in his dreams, that she is real. An epic episode called ""Darla"", is a real butt kicker. It is a continuation of the 'Buffy' season 5 episode, ""Fool For Love"". It chronicles the history between Angel/Angelus and Darla thru the years. Old fiends Spike and Drusilla appear as well. It's a massive episode that is completely on a grand scale. Darla learns that she, now back as a human, is dying from the disease that she was dying from back when she was human, before The Master turned her. Angel tries to save her in ""The Trial"", but learns that it is hopeless. That ending is a shocker when Drusilla comes back, courtesy of Wolfram And Hart, to sire Darla back. The result of this is in ""Reunion"", the season's best episode. Darla is back and she and Drusilla are on the rampage. This ep also sets in stage the rest of the season. Angel has slipped into darkness and has fired Cordelia, Wesley, and Gunn. He is a man on a mission and goes it alone. It comes to a head in ""Redefinition"" when Angel confronts Darla and Dru, in a rather gruesome way. Also a thorn in Angel's side is lawyer Lindsey McDonald(Christian Kane), who has developed a love for Darla. By the time the situation has been handled and Angel and company are back together, the show shifts in tone. The 4 final episodes of the season have nothing to do with what has come before in the season. It's a 4 episode arc beginning with ""Belonging"", where the team investigate a portal to another dimension named Pylea, where the host Lorne(Andy Hallett), is from. They try to discover what happened to a young woman named Winifred when Cordelia is sucked into the portal into Pylea. ""Over The Rainbow"", ""Through The Looking Glass"", and the season finale, ""There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb"", continue this story as the rest of the gang go to Pylea to rescue Cordy, who has become a princess in this other dimension. There are a fair number of bad episodes here. ""First Impressions"" and ""Happy Anniversary"" are not only the worst episodes of the season, they are the two worst episodes of the entire series. Just awful. ""Guise Will Be Guise"" is only watchable thanks to a comedic Wesley performance. ""The Shroud Of Rahmon"" is boring and uninteresting. Many familiar faces return here. The Master, Faith(in an uncredited cameo), Willow, Harmony(in the hilarious episode ""Disharmony""), Anne(who first appeared as Chantaralle in 'Buffy' ep ""Lie To Me"", and then in the third season premiere, ""Anne""), and Detective Kate Lockley. The writing is still sharp and superb. The characters have grown and are fleshed out a lot more. This season was a lot darker than the first. At times, it got too dark and was almost a pain to watch. It was still good, but kind of depressing. David Boreanaz has grown a lot as Angel since his ""Buffy"" days. He knows the character and how the character would act and react to things. He's becoming a better actor. Andy Hallet joins the show as a telepathic demon named Lorne. He runs a karaoke bar and can read people's minds when they sing.

These are great collections of shows that really grab you, and make you forget this show was a spin-off.  It's different than BUFFY in many ways.  While BUFFY deals with the responsibility of being a hero and growing up, ANGEL deals with redeeming yourself and finding your place in a world where right and wrong is not clearly defined.  ANGEL is more &quot;out there&quot; with its characters traveling to other dimensions, and fighting very fanciful demons.  But at its core is a man struggling with his heart and soul in LA which seems to have its own demonic split personality.  Season two sees the gang relocating to a wild art deco hotel, expanding their ranks with Gunn and the Host, and facing Angel's past with the return of Darla!  The gang almost splits apart, and then find themselves in another dimension altogether!  This set is different than previous ANGEL and BUFFY DVD collections because it is widescreen!  Well...almost.  1.78:1 aspect means on normal tvs you will get a little bit of the &quot;black bar&quot; effect.  You get two commentaries, a season overview which explains the &quot;vision&quot; of the show, featurettes on monsters stunts and the agency, and scripts for two episodes.  Its a first class affair!  Definitely a must-own for fans, and could be something to convert people who have no idea who Angel is.  I have friends I have made fans just by showing them one or two episodes.  It's addictive!

749490,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00008YGRT,calvinnme,"[0, 1]","In season two we see Angel change gears from the ""monster of the week"" format of season one, to the season-long story arcs that are a trademark of the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series. Two thirds of the season deals with the resurrection of Angel's vampire lover by evil and mystical law firm Wolfram & Hart. You need to watch episode 1.7 of Buffy entitled ""Angel"" to get the backstory on this, since this is the episode in which ""Angel"" kills Darla's vampire self. Thus, Darla, resurrected in human rather than vampire form, has a desire for revenge against Angel, and at the same time has to deal with her human conscience for the first time in 400 years. When it is discovered that Darla is dying from the same disease she was dying from when she was transformed into a vampire the first time, Angel futilely seeks a cure. Lindsey, the Wolfram & Hart lawyer who has fallen in love with Darla, finds another way to keep her alive. Since working for an evil law firm has discounted the value of a soul in Lindsey's eyes, his solution is to remake Darla into a vampire.The strain of first regaining Darla as a human and then losing her to vampirism is too much for Angel, and this sends his soul to a very dark place. He spends months forgetting about his original mission of helping the helpless and goes on a crusade of punishing the guilty, thus becoming obsessed with revenge against those responsible at Wolfram and Hart and casting his friends aside in the process. After a night of passion with Darla, Angel finally realizes that what he has reached is perfect dispair, not perfect happiness, and tries to regain his friends. For obvious reasons - he fired them and sent them packing - his former associates are slow to trust him, but they do come around and manage to forgive him. The last four episodes of the season are about the fang gang taking a trip to Lorne's original dimension - Pylea - where there is no such thing as music and where Cordelia is first enslaved and then made princess. Besides the change to story-arc form there are several other developments in this second season of Angel, most of them good.1. Wesley transitions from comic relief to more of the ""brains with bravery"" character we have come to know.2. Cordelia moves further away from self absorption.3.

749493,AUPYKCIQEITAS,B00008YGRT,Cinephile,"[9, 9]","I don't know what it is with me and Joss Whedon shows-- I always seem to come to the party late. I didn't start watching BUFFY until its fourth season, and kicked myself for not watching sooner (which is why, like any good cinephile, I bow to the great goodness of DVDs). You'd think I'd have learned my lesson, but no-- I really didn't start watching ANGEL until this past season (coincidentally, also the program's fourth. Maybe it's fate).In fairness to me, ANGEL did get off to something of a slow start-- I love its first season (and do buy that one, too. In fact, buy it first. Go on, click on the link. I can wait), but it's definitely a looser, more low-key cousin to the high melodrama of BUFFY. Also, not having seen the high school years, Angel (character and show) was something of a puzzle to me-- brooding, mopey, somewhat drab. I didn't get it.Flashforward to the ANGEL Season One box's release this year-- having caught up on just who our dark, tortured hero was (and being particularly impressed by the events of BUFFY season two-- go on, you know you want to purchase it. It's ok, we have time), having knowledge of wesley and cordelia, I was much better prepared to enjoy season one (and to catch up with the other seasons through friends' videos). Any longtime watcher of Whedon, though, knows that it's usually the second season where things take off. That's true of ANGEL, as well. In fact, while the show has arguably gotten better each year (really, those who missed the events of the last year are in for a treat when season four is released), I maintain a special affection for this year, when the return of Darla (seemingly dusted by Angel in BUFFY's first season) pushes our hero over the edge, and Angel Investigations is thrown into a tailspin.Without giving away more than the above, let me just say that this is the year when ANGEL gets really dark, and in that darkness, finds its own voice.  It's darker and more adult than BUFFY, but also, oddly, extremely funny (as in an episode like ""Guise will be Guise""). David Boreanaz comes into his own as a leading man, and is ably supported by stalwarts Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia) and Alexis Denisof (Wesley), as well as newcomers J. August Richards (Gunn) and, towards the end of the year, Amy Acker (Fred). Best of all, Angel is pitted against twisted law firm Wolfram and Hart, which offers both the kinds of neo-noir dealings ANGEL fans have come to expect, and the opportunity to watch devilishly fun actors like Christian Kane strut their stuff.If there's one thing Whedon viewers have learned, it's that he has little patience for the easy moral solutions-- there is good and evil in the BuffyVerse, but it's always in shades of gray. Even moreso than its parent show, ANGEL evades easy solutions and clear-cut heroes and villains (as, really, any show about a vampire with a soul really should).  By delving into the darkest parts of Angel's soul, this season finds the show breaking through creatively.Or, to put it another way: demon karaoke.

Why is Season 2 the best?  It has the best cast of recurring characters, almost all of whom are gone by the end of episode 18.  And it has a definite arc, although some freestanding episodes are interspersed in among the progressing shows.  One of the very best of the freestanding episodes is Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been, which is a true masterpiece (and has echoes of the original Twilight Zone episode The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street!).  Disharmony is also an excellent stand-alone episode, but this is one of the funniest episodes yet as Mercedes McNab reprises her role as Harmony the ditzy vampire from Sunnydale.  She is a riot! This season also provides the strongest conflict between Angel Investigations and its nemesis, the evil law firm of Wolfram & Hart, as Angel's sire Darla is brought back from the dead (at the cost of Lindsey's right hand) to beguile and bedevil Angel.  Lorne the empathetic demon is a welcome addition to the cast from the first episode, and the addition of Fred in the last four episodes (and also The Groosalugg, who will be around in the beginning of Season 3) is a touch of genius.However, the highlight of Season 2 is the Angel/Darla/Lindsey conflict, with the brilliant contributions of two gorgeous and remarkably talented actors, Julie Benz and Christian Kane.  They were a devastating loss to the show when the storyline ended (although Benz makes a few appearances in Season 3 and one in Season 4).  Drusilla enters in The Trial and, along with Stephanie Romanov (Lindsey's evil colleague Lilah), Sam Anderson (their boss Holland Manners), and Gerry Becker (his replacement Nathan Reed) provide the counterpoint to the Angel Investigations theme.  These magnificent actors are gone from the show much too soon, with the exception of Romanov.  And the storyline peaks in Reunion, an episode with an ending that must be seen to be believed.Elisabeth Rohm (Kate Lockley) is another brilliant cast member who leaves the show at the end of this season, and Julia Lee (Anne Steele, who had called herself first Chanterelle and then Lily on two episodes of Buffy) appears too briefly.Other highlights include songs by Andy Hallett (Lorne), Julie Benz, and Christian Kane, all of whom sing very well, and songs by David Boreanaz and the trio of Wes, Cordy, and Gunn, who don't!  And the bookish Wes becomes a true hero as the season develops.  In the last four (Pylea) episodes, he becomes a leader.  There is also a very brief appearance by Eliza Dushku as Faith.Buy this, watch this, and cherish this.  You'll never see its like again.

749498,A1KZ93IQ774KR0,B00008YGRT,"D. O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[4, 5]","With the second season, &quot;Angel&quot; began to lose the episodic nature that effected the first season. Story arc's began to take over the show, letting all the charaters grow. The fundemental reason this show got better -and what genre shows like Voyager and Enterprise have forgotten - is by letting the characters grow from each situtaion to the next, makes the show more enjoyable and believeable. The Temporal Reset Button that currently exists in the Star Trek universe will be it's undoing.But this season, &quot;Angel&quot; also seemed to grow away from &quot;Buffy&quot; -despite the crossover episode &quot;Darla&quot;/&quot;Fool For Love.&quot; Still, the whole Darla arc was well done and one can't say enough about the final arc of the season, and the wacky journey to The Host's universe.The Host, or Lorne, was one of the best characters introduced, and I have to admit, even to this day, I'm not a big Fred fan. But, Amy Acker does a good job. But its Andy Hallett's obvious joy of playing Lorne that makes him enjoyable to watch.And it's one of the funniest seasons, also. I've always thought this series balanced the horror and the humor better than Buffy.Still, the second season set up so much that would come in season three and four -which is perhaps the series most creative year.Note: Interesting blooper (?) in the episode &quot;Are Youn Now or Have You Ever Been?&quot;.

And with the surprise ending of &quot;To Shanshu in LA&quot;, which saw the resurrection of Darla, the promise for Season 2 was quite high. What audiences saw was the beginning of Angel's golden era.Joining the &quot;official&quot; cast this season was J. August Richards, continuing on as Gunn. Unofficially, Andy Hallett would sign on as Lorne, the Host of Caritas, a demon karaoke bar, and Amy Acker would be introduced at season's end as Fred. Throw in the recurring roles by Elizabeth Rohm (Kate), Stephanie Romanov (Lilah), Christian Kane (Lindsey), and Julie Benz (Darla) and a host of great guest stars, and you have a truly impeccable cast.The episodes, which deal with Angel's obsessive quest to save Darla and the subsequent rebuilding of his friendships with Wes, Cordy, and Gunn afterwards, are consistently excellent all throughout the season. Highlights include &quot;Are You Know or Have You Ever Been&quot;, Wesley's turn as &quot;Angel&quot; in &quot;Guise Will Be Guise&quot;, &quot;Darla&quot;, &quot;Reprise&quot;, and the four episode Pylea arc.This DVD set is presented in anamorphic widescreen (although a brief establishing shot in &quot;Dead End&quot; is curiously windowboxed) as originally intended, and looks great. The included featurettes are a pleasure to watch (as is the case with previous Buffyverse sets), but the lack of scripts and/or commentaries is quite disturbing.

Charisma Carpenter continues to shine as the sometimes sarcastic Cordelia, while Alexis Denisof continues to make the formally foppish Wesley into one of the more multi-faceted characters in TV today.  Upgraded from recurring status, J. August Richards makes Gunn a valuable addition to the team with wry humor and solid timing.  As the resurrected Darla, Julie Benz is equal parts sexy and sinister.  Special mention must go to Andy Hallet, who makes the recurring role of Lorne (aka the Host, a singing demon with a Las Vegas attitude), a wonderfully fun creation.  In a special cameo towards season's end, co-creator Joss Whedon manages to steal the show as a dancing green-skinned demon.The DVD once again has solid picture and sound.

Dumdei,"[14, 14]","Season One of ANGEL ends with Wolfram & Hart, the evil lawfirm who seem to have become Angel Investigations' archenemy, resurrecting Angel's sire, Darla, whom Angel staked in the first season of ANGEL's parent-series, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. So the second season of ANGEL starts off with the slow, moral decline of our hero as he learns of her return and reacts to her presence.The second season of ANGEL is really the season when this series began to break free from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and it really does wonders for the show. By developing distinct storylines that have little or no dependence on stories from the earlier show, ANGEL becomes strong on its own. There is only one official BUFFY-ANGEL crossover episode during Season Two, and it really only features a BUFFY castmember in flashback. My biggest criticism would be that the season doesn't really seem to find its strength until the latter half, but it's still a fun ride getting there - much better than the first season, no matter which half you watch.In Season Two, Charles Gunn, the ghetto-raised moster fighter we met at the end of Season One, becomes a full-time cast member bringing with him all new stories. We meet The Host (aka Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan or ""Lorne"") whose home dimension plays a significant part later in the season. Fred (Amy Acker), a future regular castmember, makes her first appearance as a crazy slave-girl on the run. We get to see old characters take on new dimensions. Cordelia eases into her role as Angel Investigations employee and ""vision girl"" and begins to shed her shallow BUFFY persona. Wesley shows that he has what it takes to be a leader and not just the comical sidekick. Most of all, Angel takes a walk down a very dark path only to come out on a much brighter side. (It really is great to see David Boreanaz playing the dark side of Angel without having to go to Angelus lengths to do so.)With this increasingly strong show, fans can finally feel free to enjoy ANGEL as a separate series from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.",4,Angel finds its own footing,1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,2049,"['Season', 'One', 'ANGEL', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'evil', 'lawfirm', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'become', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'archenemy', 'resurrecting', 'Angel', 'sire', 'Darla', 'whom', 'Angel', 'staked', 'first', 'season', 'ANGEL', 'parent-series', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'second', 'season', 'ANGEL', 'slow', 'moral', 'decline', 'hero', 'return', 'reacts', 'presence.The', 'second', 'season', 'ANGEL', 'really', 'season', 'when', 'series', 'began', 'break', 'free', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'really', 'wonders', 'show', 'developing', 'distinct', 'storylines', 'have', 'little', 'dependence', 'stories', 'earlier', 'show', 'ANGEL', 'strong', 'own', 'only', 'one', 'official', 'BUFFY-ANGEL', 'crossover', 'episode', 'Season', 'Two', 'really', 'only', 'BUFFY', 'castmember', 'flashback', 'biggest', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'season', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'find', 'strength', 'latter', 'half', 'still', 'fun', 'ride', 'getting', 'there', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'matter', 'half', 'watch.In', 'Season', 'Two', 'Charles', 'Gunn', 'ghetto-raised', 'moster', 'fighter', 'met', 'end', 'Season', 'One', 'full-time', 'cast', 'member', 'bringing', 'new', 'stories', 'meet', 'Host', 'aka', 'Krevlornswath', 'Deathwok', 'Clan', 'Lorne', 'home', 'dimension', 'significant', 'part', 'later', 'season', 'Fred', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'future', 'regular', 'castmember', 'first', 'appearance', 'crazy', 'slave-girl', 'run', 'get', 'see', 'old', 'characters', 'take', 'new', 'dimensions', 'Cordelia', 'role', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'employee', 'vision', 'girl', 'shed', 'shallow', 'BUFFY', 'persona', 'Wesley', 'what', 'be', 'leader', 'not', 'just', 'comical', 'sidekick', 'Most', 'Angel', 'walk', 'down', 'very', 'dark', 'path', 'only', 'come', 'out', 'much', 'brighter', 'side', 'really', 'great', 'see', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'playing', 'dark', 'side', 'Angel', 'having', 'go', 'Angelus', 'lengths', 'do', 'so', 'increasingly', 'strong', 'show', 'fans', 'can', 'finally', 'feel', 'free', 'enjoy', 'ANGEL', 'separate', 'series', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER']",Angel - Season Two

However, what we do get, is the return of Darla.  Angel killed Darla in Season 1 of Buffy, however Wolfram &amp; Hart decide to bring Darla back in order to control not only her, but Angel as well.  We see Darla enter Angel's dreams and those dreams begin to haunt Angel.  The majority of the season deals with Darla and her influence on Angel.  As a result of her return, he pushes away Cordy, Wesley and Gunn.  This season showed more of the dark, brooding side of Angel's character, which is very important to understand.The second part of the season sees the crew get transported to Pylea, where the Host (or Loren) is from.  They must go to save Cordy, who was sucked into the world.  It was very amusing to see Cordelia as a &quot;Princess.&quot;  Isn't that what she's always wanted to be?We do get some Buffy-land characters.  Harmony comes to visit Cordy, who finds out about Harmony's &quot;secret&quot; from Willow.  We get Drusela, who wonderfully played by the talented Juliet Landou, drawing Darla back into vampire land.  Also, although she does not say anything, the effect of Willow at the end of the season, when she comes to tell about Buffy (Season 5 ending) is wonderful.Overall, good and essential season.  &quot;Angel&quot; pulled away from &quot;Buffy&quot; and became a show unto its own.

Angel (played by David Boreanaz) and his employees; at the beginning of this season, they include former Watcher Wesley (Alexis Denisof), former vampire hunter Gunn (J. August Richards) and former prom queen Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) - the brains, muscle, and snark of the group, respectively. And in the course of the season, the Host (Andy Hallett) - a psychic demon who also happens to own a karaoke bar - and Fred (Amy Acker) - a batty young physicist - join the Fang Gang as well.In this second season, Angel comes into its own, no longer in the shadow of its parent series. Angel's investigation agency is doing well, when things are derailed by the appearance of his dead sire, Darla (Julie Benz), brought to you by the demonic lawyers at Wolfram and Hart. Over the course of the season, Angel allows Darla and Wolfram and Hart trigger his spiral into darkness, culminating in his willingness to let Darla and the insane Drusilla (Juliet Landau) kill a roomful of W&H; lawyers and in the firing of his employees. Only after he's had an epiphany and returned to make an uneasy peace with his former friends does the season conclude, in a rousing several-part finale that involves travelling to the otherdimensional Pylea in an effort to save Cordelia from her own delusions of grandeur.Also, as one might expect from a spin-off TV series, there are cameos galore. Faith (Eliza Dushku), Spike (James Marsters), Harmony (Mercedes McNab), Willow (Alyson Hannigan)...all make appearances of some sort or another during the season. Of special note is Harmony's hysterically funny appearance during her visit with best friend Cordelia in the episode ""Disharmony.""While it's not necessary to have seen either Buffy or the first season of Angel to understand this DVD set, it is helpful. And with the end of Buffy, fans of that show may want to move on to this one, which at times in recent seasons has eclipsed its parent series.

749529,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B00008YGRT,kaduzy,"[3, 5]","With its second season, Angel once again proved that it is a cut (or a bite, perhaps?) above Buffy, with darker stories, deeper characters and more mayhem than ever before.Buffy was never separated from her loyal band of ""Scoobies"" for more than one episode (in seasons 4 & 7, respectively).  But the writers of Angel had the guts to keep their dark hero apart from his core group for one third of the entire season.  They delved deeply into what it means to be ""dark"" or evil, and succeeded in painting the portrait of a character who is not simply black or white -- Angel is what a really compelling character should be: layer upon layer of grey.  And David Boreanaz has never been better.In this season, the diabolical lawyers at Wolfram & Hart brought Angel's sire, Darla back from the grave as a human being dying of the same syphillis that would have killed her had she not become a vampire in the first place.  The turmoil she creates for Angel makes for great television, and their scenes together are compelling.  His friends keep reminding him that she is not his mission, but Angel cannot walk away.  And even though he doesn't lose his soul to her, he definitely leaves his path and embarks upon one of darkness as he tries to fight Wolfram & Hart, Darla and the newly arrived Druscilla on his own.  And the series isn't afraid to follow him down that empty road.  The scene in ""Reunion"" when he walks away from the massacre is one of the best I have seen on network television.Another noteworthy episode is ""The Thin Dead Line"".  Only in Whedon-verse would the subject of LAPD violence against inner-city citizens be dealt with this way . . . with zombie cops!  The concept sounds cheesy and in anyone else's hands it would have been, but this is one of the series' most frightening episodes.  And in between the scares, it manages to be one of the most pivotal episodes of the series as the human characters are forced to deal with superhuman evil with no superpowers of their own to combat it.  It leaves Wesley broken and Cordelia irate with Angel, changes the power dynamic of the group, and creates the kind of drama and conflict between core characters that other TV shows can only hope to have.Equally as compelling in this season are the subplots with Detective Kate Lockley.  As a complex character with her own demons to fight, she is the perfect example of what it means to be a character on this show: there is no character too minor to have multiple layers.  She disappears before the season ends and I can only keep my fingers crossed that unlike the truly missed Doyle, she will be back.This series is so addictive that I couldn't wait until I could afford more seasons to find out what happened, so I went online and peeked.  But even knowing what's going to happen in future seasons hasn't quelled my desire to watch every single one of them.  I'm hooked!  This is obviously one of the best shows on television, and it's a shame that it didn't get to age gracefully and finish naturally.  Don't miss out on this treasure.

This six Disk DVD Set is extraordinary. The Picture and Sound quality are so very good that you feel as though you are watching it in a theater. The closed captioning and Audio come in other languages besides English. It's jam packed with all sorts of extra bonus specials. The Brilliant creator, Joss Whedon and other staff members are at their very best, just as they were with their work on Buffy (which is also a must own). I not only highly recommend this Season disk set, but the other four seasons as well. Quite a bit of quality work went into the making of all five seasons. They are a necessary buy for any Angel fan! It's completely impossible to be anything but extremely pleased with this purchase as well as the rest of the series. The writing, acting , directing, etc... are amazing per usual. This is without question once again feature film quality. The fact that all but the first season is filmed in Letter Box gives it that theater feel. In addition, the closed-captioning is less likely to interfere with the picture.David Boreanaz (Angel) and Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia) are brilliant in their performance together as well as the growing sexual tension between them. I must give extra credit to J. August Richards as (Charles Gunn), he is a perfect addition to the cast. He was introduced at the end of Season One. He adds the much needed diversification of characters to the growing cast. He's known mostly as the muscle, but is so much more. A fine actor with much charisma as well as humor. The addition of the karaoke singing club owner Andy Hallet (Known as The Host in the beginning and then  Lorne). He plays our green demon from another dimension with physic ability that gives much room for expanding the stories. He adds some comic relief along with a fabulous singing voice. Last, but certainly not least, look out folks here comes Julie Benz (Darla). She is by far one of the BEST actors on TV and now lucky for us DVD. She is without a doubt AMAZING. You'll just have to by this season to see what I mean. Don't miss her incredible performance in season three. Joss Whedon once again comes through with continuing to make the show interesting, believable even though it's all fantasy. He does this because he makes the people real and the stories real despite that they are all rooted in fiction. I not only highly recommend this Season disk set, but the other four seasons as well. Any true Angel fan must complete their set with this one. It's a keeper folks. Purchase this before it gets sold out and you miss your chance to continue your collection.

749531,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008YGRT,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 10]","Season Two was when both Angel and ""Angel"" lost its way.  On the one hand you can clearly define this episode in terms of the character of the Host (Andy Hallett), who first pops up in ""Judgment"" as the host of Caritas, a karaoke joint that serves as a safe haven for demons.  The next thing we know Angel (David Boreanaz) is singing, for lack of a better word, ""Mandy.""  At the end of the year we learn that the Host is actually Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan, shortened to the convenience and conventions of this dimension as ""Lorne,"" and Angel Investigations ends up ""Over the Rainbow"" is Pylea, where things are totally ""Through the Looking Glass,"" and they learn that ""There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb.""  This is all fun enough, but in between we have Angel letting Darla (Julie Benz) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau) snack on the lawyers of Wolfram & Hart  (""Reunion"") and then lights the two fem fatale vamps on fire (""Redefinition"").  In between, Angel fires everybody at Angel Investigations.One of the things we have come to expect from a series created (or co-created) by Joss Whedon is the ability to play both light and dark.  We have also come to expect a story-arc for the first half of the season that combines in some interesting way with the second half story-arc.  What that means here is that Angel spends the first half of the second season destroying everything he has built because of Darla, and the second half trying to put it back together again after an initial period where he does not especially want to.  For me the problem is that while the previous season ended with the revelation that Wolfram & Hart had brought back Darla, it also revealed the correct translation of the word ""shanshu"" was ""to live"" rather than ""to die.""  Once the vampire with a soul fulfills his destiny, he (read Angel at this point) will become human as his reward.  Angel allowed, ""That'd be nice.""  How we got from that Angel to the one smoking a cigarette so he could flick it into a pool of gasoline to torch Darla and Drusilla is what makes the first half of the season interesting.  As Darla correctly observes, the creature who did this was neither Angel nor Angelus.Even if we do not agree with the dark place to which Angel goes in this second season, Whedon and series co-creator David Greenwalt justify the transformation.  The series was fortunate in bringing back the character of Darla because over the next two seasons Julie Benz was going to turn in the best performance by a recurring guest star on either ""Angel"" (or ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") culminating in the show's best moment when Connor is born in the third season.  The mind games that Darla plays with Angel, aided and abetted by the Wolfram & Hart tag team of Lindsey McDonald (Christian Kane) and Lila Morgan (Stephanie Romanov), provides adequate motivation, especially when Angel fails to save Darla and she is turned back into a vampire by Drusilla.For me the problem is getting from that dark place to Angel basking in the sunlight of Pylea, made possible because it takes six episodes for Angel to see the light (""Epiphany"").  It seems to me that should have been the big finale for the show's second season given how dark it was getting, but instead we get the comic adventures of the gang in a demon dimension.  True, we get the sight of Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) as queen, the addition of Amy Acker as Fred, and the season ends with Alyson Hannigan showing up as Willow to tell Angel by just the look on her face that something has happened to Buffy.  But given Angel's dark descent the reversal at the end is rather disquieting (and certainly unique in the dozen ""BtVS""/""Angel"" finales).The best episodes in Season Two usually have to do with the Darla plot line, with Drala setting Kate Lockley (Elisabeth Rohm) after Angel in ""Dear Boy,"" Angel facing ""The Trial"" to try and save Darla (who sings ""Ill Wind"" at Caritas), and Darla and Dru on the town in ""Reunion.""  I also like Lindsey's swan song in ""Dead End,"" thanks to his ""evil hand,"" and especially since Christian Kane sing at Caritas.  The two best comedy episodes of the season are ""Guise Will be Guise,"" where Wesley (Alexis Denisov) is mistaken for Angel by a beautiful client, Virginia Bryce (Brigid Brannagh) and tries to play the role the hilt, and then ""Disharmony,"" where Harmony (Mercedes McNab) the vampire shows up on the doorstep of Cordelia and decides to try and go straight (unlike Willow, who has a very funny phone call from Cory).  But there really is nothing funnier than the Dance of Shame that Lorne's mother insists upon when her offspring returns home to Pylea (because Lorne's severed head talking was not a surprise).On balance and from the perspective of looking back on the five season of the show, I think Season 2 was the weakest year of ""Angel.""  That being said, this is a pretty good low point.  If they had explored the character who was neither Angel nor Angelus for the rest of the season and really wallowd in the dark stuff I would have rated the season higher because as ""Angel"" proved the following year it was when things got really bad that the show got really good.  Getting away from the flashbacks always being about the Angelus years to an earlier time in Angel's quest for atonement in ""Are You Now or Have You Ever Been?"" was a good move and taking advantage of Wolfram & Hart in ""Blood Money"" were solid stand alone episodes.  In the end, the worst thing I can saw about ""Angel, Season 2"" is that the first half was better than the second half.  That might seem a minor complaint, but not with a Joss Whedon show.",4,As Darla said it was neither Angel nor Angelus in Season 2,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,5619,"['Season', 'Two', 'was', 'when',

749532,A2S9P70216QC2H,B00008YGRT,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[2, 4]","After an excellent start with its first season, Angel began to truly become it's own with its impressive sophomore season. Not just using the monster-of-the-week format, this is when the series began to create it's own story arcs, and the first is an amazing one. Wolfram and Hart has brought back Darla, the vampire who sired Angel and became his lover for over 150 years. But with Darla back, Angel begins to lose himself in his dreams, which he soon realizes are real when he finds that Darla is alive. Wesley, Cordelia and Gunn are on Angel's side, but soon Angel's obsession with stopping Darla makes him take on a dark persona that drives his 3 friends away. We are also introduced to new character like the over the top Lorne aka The Host and Fred, the quirky young scientist stuck in Pylea, The Host's home dimension. Here's Season 2:Judgment Day-Great episode!! ""When Cordelia's latest vision misleads Angel into killing a fellow champion who was protecting a pregnant woman, leaving Angel to become the woman's new champion."" A great season premiere episode with nice settings and fight scenes. There are also hilarious dialogue with Wesley, Gunn and Cordelia.Are You Now or Have You Ever Been?-Incredible episode!! ""When Angel asks Cordelia and Wesley to investigate the Hyperion Hotel, Angel recalls during the 50's when he stayed at the hotel and a Thesilack demon drove the residents mad."" This was a dark, chilling episode that's one of the best episodes of the series.First Impressions-Pretty good episode!! ""When Cordelia gets a vision of Gunn in danger, she becomes his unofficial protector as both track down Angel's car and a demon name Devack while Angel dreams of Darla."" The episode has a dull plot but great character development for both Cordelia and Gunn. The dream sequences are great, though/Untouched-Great episode!! ""When Cordelia's vision leads Angel to frighten girl with telekinetic powers, Angel tries to help the girl control her powers while Wolfram and Hart plan to make the girl their newest assassin."" Bethany was interesting character and her powers were amazing to watch.Dear Boy-Amazing episode!! ""As his dreams of Darla become more constant, Angel soon realizes Darla is alive in real life, just as Wesley, Gunn, and Cordelia believe he is becoming evil again."" I just love how Darla plays with Angel's mind in this episode; she's very manipulative and cunning. There was also top notch acting from David and Julie Benz.Guise Will Be Guise-Weak episode!! ""While Angel is off visiting a mystical swami, Wesley goes undercover as Angel to protect a young woman."" The plot is slighty boring, but Wesley is hilarious when he plays Angel.Darla-Amazing episode!! ""As Angel tries to find Darla and save her from Wolfram and Hart, Darla slowly loses her mind and recalls the day she was sired by the Master until the day she left Angelus after he got a soul."" Just a stunning episode with brilliant flashbacks and more amazing acting from David and Julie Benz.The Shroud of Rahmon-Bad episode!! ""When Angel and Gunn go undercover as members of a robbery, they steal a shroud that quickly drives all the robbers and anyone close to the shroud insane."" This was a dull episode with the shroud plot being just poor and embarrassing.The Trial-Great episode!! ""When Gunn track down Darla, Angel goes after her only to find out she is dying from a terminal illness which leads him to do battle in a mystical trial to let her live."" The trial setting is fantastic with some disturbing scenes and not to mention, the unforgettable ending with Drusilla siring Darla in the end!Reunion-Incredible episode!! ""Now as a vampire again, Darla and Drusilla wreck havoc in the streets of L.A., leaving Angel to go after them, but Wesley, Cordelia and Gunn fear that their boss might go to far."" The most shocking episode I have ever seen on a series! Just the sight of Angel walking away as Darla and Drusilla feeding on all those lawyers is beyond jaw-dropping, no to mention firing his friends...A must see!Redefinition-Amazing episode!! ""After firing his friends, Angel sets out on a new mission to destroy Darla and Drusilla taking on a darker persona just as Wesley, Gunn and Cordelia continue the good fight on their own."" The portrayal of Angel's dark persona is amazing, not mention the scene with him setting Darla and Drusilla on fire...WOW!Blood Money-Pretty good episode!! ""Angel threatens to expose Wolfram and Hart's criminal activities when they steal money from a local homeless shelter, just as an old adversary arrives to fight Angel."" It was funny watching Angel trick Lilah and Lindsey. Also, Anne, aka Lily from Buffy, reappears on Angel as the owner of the homeless shelter.Happy Anniversary-Pretty good episode!! ""Lorne aka The Host asks Angel for help him search for a physicist who will end the world, while Gunn, Wesley and Cordelia go on their latest case."" Nice filler, Lorne was hilarious with Angel yet the overall story dragged.The Thin Red Line-Good episode!! ""When renegade cops begin beating on the innocent by standers, Angel and Kate investigate while the cops attack the rest of the gang at the homeless shelter."" The zombie cops were creepy and very surreal metaphor for how some cops are in real life.Reprise-Great episode!! ""When Angel learns of an important meeting with the Senior Partners at Wolfram and Hart, he plans to beat them at their dimension."" I loved Darla in this episode especially with the shocking ending.Epiphany-Great episode!! ""After a passionate night with Darla, Angel wakes up and has an epiphany. Realizing how far he lost it, she seeks out Gunn, Wesley and Cordelia who are in trouble on their own."" There are some funny scenes with Wesley and the third eye in the back of Cordelia's head...ehw!Disharmony-Great episode!! ""With Angel back on the team, the gang investigates a vampire cult with a strange plan just as Harmony, who is now a vampire, arrives in town."" A hilarious episode with funny lines from Harmony as well as the rest of the gang.Dead End-Great episode!! ""When Lindsey is offered a new hand by Wolfram and Hart, he realizes that the hand has a mind of its own leading him to work with Angel and the rest of the gang in the process."" A very creepy episode which features Lindsey's last appearance, but only for a while.Belonging-Good episode!! ""When a demon escapes from a portal that opens in Lorne's club, Caritas, Angel and the gang track it down they run into Lorne's cousin from his home dimension."" It was great learning about Lorne in this episode and we get a small appearance of Fred.Over The Rainbow-Great episode!! ""With Cordelia trapped in Pylea, Lorne's home dimension, the rest of the gang tries to find another portal so they can rescue her.""Pylea is great setting and there are some funny moments throughout.Through The Looking Glass-Great episode!! ""Now with Cordelia as Princess of Pylea, the gang split up with Wesley and Gunn helping Cordelia with Lorne and Angel off to meet Lorne's family."" There are more funny scenes and the Groosalugg makes his first appearance.There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb-Great episode!! ""Still split apart, Fred helps Angel with his monstrous side, Wesley and Gunn help a bunch of rebels, and Cordelia must find a way to help a headless Lorne."" This was a good finale, with a good fight scene and developments.The second season was amazing year which say Angel getting darker and doing more storytelling this time around. The acting got even better and the character starting maturing a bit.

749533,AGN8YYJ6BHBEU,B00008YGRT,"Lucifer ""Superman isn't brave he is invulnerable""","[6, 7]","Season 2 really begins to delve into Angel's dark side and his past as the evil vampire Angelus. His sire Darla plays a huge role and Julie Benz does a fine job that really is a coup and pure luck in casting. Darla was on Season 1 of Buffy for a few episodes and they killed her off without knowing at the time that Angel would get his own show and require her to play a heavy role. As it turns out Julie did a great job and the story of how Angel became a vampire is fleshed out nicely.It is always interesting to take your hero/heroine and show their flaws. It adds texture and depth to a character. Angel's flaws and past are wallowed in and we get to see the dynamics involved in all that he has done. The viewer is shown the evidence and allowed to decide for themselves.Angel breaks from his gang in Season 2 and begins to play with the darkside. As this is happening the gang are left to continue Angel Investigations without Angel himself. This leads to some much needed character development for Wesley, Gunn, and Cordy. The show kinda meanders around the 4th disc until the entrance into Pylea.One of the strangest arcs on either Buffy or Angel. The Pylea arc had potential to suck really bad. The best part of it was that it was so unexpectedly good. It is things like this that would kill most shows. Once we got to Pylea it was so apparent how badly the show needed to get away from LA for a while. It was painfully obvious that we needed that escape to another world. The Pylea episodes are strong, funny, and well acted by all involved.Season 2 is a little shaky at times but the show remains steady and opens the door for the classic 3 seasons to follow.",4,A show on the rise.,1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,1670,"['Season', '2', 'really', 'delve', 'Angel', 'dark', 'side', 'past', 'evil', 'vampire', 'Angelus', 'sire', 'Darla', 'huge', 'role', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'fine', 'job', 'really', 'coup', 'pure', 'luck', 'casting', 'Darla', 'was', 'Season', '1', 'Buffy', 'few', 'episodes', 'killed', 'off', 'knowing', 'time', 'Angel', 'would', 'get', 'own', 'show', 'require', 'play', 'heavy', 'role', 'out', 'Julie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'story', 'how', 'Angel', 'became', 'vampire', 'fleshed', 'out', 'nicely.It', 'always', 'interesting', 'take', 'hero/heroine', 'show', 'flaws', 'texture', 'depth', 'character', 'Angel', 'flaws', 'past', 'are', 'wallowed', 'get', 'see', 'dynamics', 'involved', 'done', 'viewer', 'shown', 'evidence', 'allowed', 'decide', 'themselves.Angel', 'breaks', 'gang', 'Season', '2', 'begins', 'play', 'darkside', 'happening', 'gang', 'are', 'left', 'continue', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'Angel', 'much', 'needed', 'character', 'development', 'Wesley', 'Gunn', 'Cordy', 'show', 'meanders', '4th', 'disc', 'entrance', 'Pylea.One', 'strangest', 'arcs', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Pylea', 'arc', 'had', 'potential', 'suck', 'really', 'bad', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'unexpectedly', 'good', 'things', 'would', 'kill', 'most', 'shows', 'got', 'Pylea', 'was', 'so', 'apparent', 'how', 'badly', 'show', 'needed', 'get', 'away', 'LA', 'while', 'was', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'needed', 'escape', 'world', 'Pylea', 'episodes', 'are', 'strong', 'funny', 'well', 'acted', 'involved.Season', '2', 'little', 'shaky', 'times', 'show', 'steady', 'door', 'classic', '3', 'seasons', 'follow']",Angel - Season Two

August Richards). in the first episode Angel tries to protect a pregnant lady and he has this ultimate jousting fight in the middle of the street. in the other corner you have Darla entering back into Angel's life after he killed her in season 1 of Buffy The Vampire Slayer and she was resserected by Wolfram and Hart at the end of season 1. Cordelia still has her visions. Angel and his crew move into a hotel that was in Angel's past after the Angel Investigations blew up. still on the bad guy side is Holland Manners(Sam Anderson) who Angel lets Darla and Drusilla kill,also theres still Lilah Morgan(Stephanie Romanov) and the plastic hand Lindsey(Christian Kane)I have to note that I found out Kane auditioned for Riley Finn, which he would of did a better job at that then Marc Blucas, seriously. other guest stars are Tony Todd(Candyman Movies), Juliet Landau(Drusilla), James Marsters(Spike), MArk Metcalf(The Master), Mark Rolston(Boone), Matthew James(Merl), Faith(Eliza Dushku), Mark Lutz(Grooslaaug), Mercedes McNab(Harmony Kendall) and Alyson Hannigan(Willow Rosenberg, Willow comes at the last episode basically to tell Angel that Buffy died). we are introduced in episode one of the Carita's Host Lorne(Andy Hallet) who has Angel sing &quot;Mandy&quot; which is hilarious and the ever so beautiful Amy Acker(Winifred Burkle/Fred) at the last 3 or 4 episodes. Acker joins the cast in season 3 and Andy Hallet joins midway in season 4. A great view and probably one of the best show's out there right now after Buffy was done with its 7 year run.

749539,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00008YGRT,Mitch Weaver,"[2, 2]","I never managed to catch Angel while it was on television. However, I have been watching the show season per season on the DVD sets. After the first season of Angel, my doubts of Angel not being a success were put to rest. Now I have only seen the first four seasons of the show. But based on what I have seen, even though the second season was very good it is actually my least favorite season of the show. The storyline of season two moved somewhat slowly because of the neverending series of flashbacks into Angel's life. It was necessary to show some backstory on Angel's life as Angelus, but the writers went overboard.However, the positives far outweigh the negatives in the second season. The core group of characters was only helped by adding Charles Gunn to the mix, the evil lawfirm of Wolfram and Hart was expanded on and involved much more in the story than in season one, and Julie Benz did such an amazing job as Darla that it was most unreal. One of the best things to come out of season two was the introduction of a demon named Lorne who is able to read a person's soul by listening to them sing. Lorne definately helped to make season two an enjoyable one and he has slowly become one of my favorite characters. Perhaps the thing that suprised me most of all, was how much I enjoyed the end of the season. The idea of sending the characters off to Lorne's home dimension of Pylea to rescue Cordelia after she is sucked through a portal is definately out of left field. But the writers handled it suprisingly well and manage to supply a fitting end to the season.A few episodes worth mentioning are ""Are You Now or Have You Ever Been"" in which we learn about how Angel is connected to the group's new basis of operations the Hyperion Hotel, ""Guise Will Be Guise"" in which Wesley is forced to impersonate Angel to protect the daughter of a client, ""Reunion"" in which Drusilla returns and Darla and Drusilla team up to massacre the people of Los Angeles, and ""Disharmony"" in which Harmony visits and Cordelia has no idea she is a vampire.While season two of Angel is my least favorite of the show, it is still a very good season filled with some really great episodes. This is definately a must own for any fans of the show, and the extras only make the DVD set that much better.A solid 4 1/2 stars...",4,Very good season.. 4 1/2 stars,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,2316,"['never', 'managed', 'catch', 'Angel', 'was', 'television', 'However', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'season', 'season', 'DVD', 'sets', 'first', 'season', 'Angel', 'doubts', 'Angel', 'not', 'being', 'success', 'were', 'put', 'rest', 'Now', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'show', 'based', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'even', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'actually', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'show', 'storyline', 'season', 'two', 'moved', 'somewhat', 'slowly', 'neverending', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'Angel', 'life', 'was', 'necessary', 'show', 'backstory', 'Angel', 'life', 'Angelus', 'writers', 'went', 'overboard.However', 'positives', 'far', 'outweigh', 'negatives', 'second', 'season', 'core', 'group', 'characters', 'was', 'only', 'helped', 'adding', 'Charles', 'Gunn', 'mix', 'evil', 'lawfirm', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'was', 'expanded', 'involved', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'season', 'one', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'Darla', 'was', 'most', 'unreal', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'come', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'introduction', 'demon', 'named', 'Lorne', 'who', 'able', 'read', 'person', 'soul', 'listening', 'sing', 'Lorne', 'definately', 'helped', 'make', 'season', 'two', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'slowly', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Perhaps', 'thing', 'suprised', 'most', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'end', 'season', 'idea', 'sending', 'characters', 'Lorne', 'home', 'dimension', 'Pylea', 'rescue', 'Cordelia', 'sucked', 'portal', 'definately', 'left', 'field', 'writers', 'handled', 'suprisingly', 'well', 'manage', 'supply', 'fitting', 'end', 'season.A', 'few', 'episodes', 'mentioning', 'are', 'Are', 'Now', 'Have', 'Ever', 'Been', 'learn', 'how', 'Angel', 'connected', 'group', 'new', 'basis', 'operations', 'Hyperion', 'Hotel', 'Guise', 'Will', 'Be', 'Guise', 'Wesley', 'forced', 'impersonate', 'Angel', 'protect', 'daughter', 'client', 'Reunion', 'Drusilla', 'returns', 'Darla', 'Drusilla', 'team', 'up', 'massacre', 'people', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Disharmony', 'Harmony', 'visits', 'Cordelia', 'idea', 'vampire.While', 'season', 'two', 'Angel', 'least', 'favorite', 'show', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'season', 'filled', 'really', 'great', 'episodes', 'definately', 'must', 'own', 'fans', 'show', 'extras', 'only', 'make', 'DVD', 'set', 'much', 'better.A', 'solid', '4', '1/2', 'stars']",Angel - Season Two
749540,A1W8ZLZ5CRAV1X,B00008YGRT,M. McMahon,"[2, 4]","Darla's back from the dead thanks to Wolfram & Hart, the evil lawfirm. There's lots of history about Darla and Angel and the ""old days"" when they were ""Bonny & Clyde takes Europe."" We also find out what killed Darla and how she came to be a vampire. Lots of background questions are answered in this season. Druisilla comes back for some episodes and you even get to see Spike a few times (sigh). There's some GREAT stuff involving escapades between Darla and Druisilla.Some day I want to watch Buffy and then the corresponding Angel episode to realize the interplay between the two shows. If you've seen both shows you know the storylines intermingle but it might be fun to actually switch back and forth instead of just watching one straight DVD season.The best new member of the show is introduced this season: Loren, the red-horned green demon who reads your destiny in your singing (by the way, Angel CANNOT sing - which is great).

749541,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00008YGRT,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[6, 11]","Reviewing Angel's second season is very hard indeed.  As a big fan of everything Joss Whedon's done (particularly Buffy, but also the late, lamented Firefly), it's all too easy to give this boxset 5 stars.  However, to be honest this is the one season of either Buffy or Angel that didn't really gel for me.  After a much more episodic structure in its first season, Angel moves into its second season with a few carefully constructed plot arcs involving the return of Angel's sire Darla, as well as the gloriously insane Drusilla.  Unfortunately this doesn't work nearly as well as it does on its sister show here, and its much more a case of individual episodes shining rather than how any one story arc is dealt with as a whole.In particular, the story involving Angel losing his faith in humanity and himself could have been so much more resonant than it is here and, although comparisons with Buffy seem unfair, her breakdown in series 6 was a lot better than Angel's here.  In addition, after Darla is 'vamped' again, her character becomes little more than a conventional villain, which is an insult to the history her and Angel have.  Yet to be fair, their history is treated with a remarkable amount of detail and respect in the earlier episodes.  By far the most infuriating aspect of this season though is the long-awaited return of fan favourite Drusilla.  Gone are the Victorian outfits and poetic language and in come pink polo necks and often silly turns of phrase.  These come off as somebody writing Drusilla who doesn't know her character very well, which is a shame considering just how good she was in season 2 of Buffy.  For me though, the most aggravating part of the season was its end, where the gang travel to Lorne's homeland of Pylea to rescue lost librarian (and future cast member) Fred.  Though there are a few laughs to be had here - notable Angel's response to the sunlight that doesn't burn, and Joss Whedon's cameo as a dancing demon - it's just too hokey for the most part.Don't get me wrong though, I didn't hate the series, all I'm saying is that it had its faults.  There were some great points to it, and if the story arcs didn't work together quite as well as they might have done you are at least safe in the knowledge that they were essential to the later series and retrospectively were crucial to the overall story.  In particular, the character development of Wesley and Cordelia here proved big stepping stones for what they'd have to face in series 3.  There was also the addition of a few new faces, namely Fred and karaoke bar owner Lorne.  Whilst both were yet to find their feet on the show, it was nice to see them branching out with an ensemble cast.  A few stand-alone episodes are also good, in particularly Darla (companion piece to Buffy's Fool For Love), which tells a good dose of backstory on everyone's favourite vamp-turned-human.  Drawing a strong performance from Julie Benz, it stands as one of the best Angel episodes even now.  Other instant classics include the opener Heartthrob, 20's pastiche Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been?, Wesley stand-out Guise Will Be Guise and social commentary The Thin Dead Line.  It's these that lift the series above nearly everything else on TV.  Unfortunately, that's not always enough to feed a fan with already high expectations of a series that delivered last time around and, after this shaky second season, really delivered some of the best entertainment around in its next 3 seasons.To sum up, Angel is a fantastic, classic piece of programming, of which season 2 isn't a very good example.  To complete anyone's collection it's a must, but for any first time viewers, any of the other series of the show are a better introduction to why this is so critically acclaimed.  The extras are also much better than those on most TV boxsets, and the commentaries and documentaries are genuinely insightful.  All in all, better than most you'll find out there, but compared to what Joss Whedon can normally pull off, it doesn't quite cut it.",3,"The worst of Angel, but still better than most TV around",1084320000,"05 12, 2004",2004,4040,"['Reviewing', 'Angel', 'second', 'season', 'very', 'hard', 'indeed', 'big', 'fan', 'everything', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'done', 'particularly', 'Buffy', 'also', 'late', 'lamented', 'Firefly', 'too', 'easy', 'give', 'boxset', '5', 'stars', 'However', 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'gel', 'much', 'more', 'episodic', 'structure', 'first', 'season', 'Angel', 'second', 'season', 'few', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'plot', 'arcs', 'involving', 'return', 'Angel', 'sire', 'Darla', 'as', 'well', 'gloriously', 'insane', 'Drusilla', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'work', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'sister', 'show', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'case', 'individual', 'episodes', 'shining', 'rather', 'how', 'one', 'story', 'arc', 'dealt', 'whole.In', 'particular', 'story', 'involving', 'Angel', 'losing', 'faith', 'humanity', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'resonant', 'here', 'comparisons', 'Buffy', 'seem', 'unfair', 'breakdown', 'series', '6', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'Angel', 'here', 'addition', 'Darla', ""'vamped"", 'again', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'conventional', 'villain', 'insult', 'history', 'Angel', 'have', 'be', 'fair', 'history', 'treated', 'remarkable', 'amount', 'detail', 'respect', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'far', 'most', 'infuriating', 'aspect', 'season', 'though', 'long-awaited', 'return', 'fan', 'favourite', 'Drusilla', 'Gone', 'are', 'Victorian', 'outfits', 'poetic', 'language', 'come', 'pink', 'polo', 'necks', 'often', 'silly', 'turns', 'phrase', 'come', 'off', 'somebody', 'writing', 'Drusilla', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'shame', 'considering', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'season', '2', 'Buffy', 'most', 'aggravating', 'part', 'season', 'was', 'end', 'where', 'gang', 'travel', 'Lorne', 'homeland', 'Pylea', 'rescue', 'lost', 'librarian', 'future', 'cast', 'member', 'Fred', 'are', 'few', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'notable', 'Angel', 'response', 'sunlight', ""n't"", 'burn', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'cameo', 'dancing', 'demon', 'just', 'too', 'hokey', 'most', 'part.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'series', ""'m"", 'saying', 'had', 'faults', 'were', 'great', 'points', 'story', 'arcs', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'together', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'are', 'least', 'safe', 'knowledge', 'were', 'essential', 'later', 'series', 'retrospectively', 'were', 'crucial', 'overall', 'story', 'particular', 'character', 'development', 'Wesley', 'Cordelia', 'here', 'proved', 'big', 'stepping', 'stones', 'what', ""'d"", 'have', 'face', 'series', '3', 'was', 'also', 'addition', 'few', 'new', 'namely', 'Fred', 'karaoke', 'bar', 'owner', 'Lorne', 'Whilst', 'were', 'yet', 'find', 'feet', 'show', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'branching', 'out', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'few', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'particularly', 'Darla', 'companion', 'piece', 'Buffy', 'Fool', 'Love', 'good', 'dose', 'backstory', 'everyone', 'favourite', 'vamp-turned-human', 'Drawing', 'strong', 'performance', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'one', 'best', 'Angel', 'even', 'now', 'Other', 'instant', 'classics', 'include', 'opener', 'Heartthrob', '20', 'pastiche', 'Are', 'Now', 'Or', 'Have', 'Ever', 'Been', 'Wesley', 'stand-out', 'Guise', 'Will', 'Be', 'Guise', 'social', 'commentary', 'Thin', 'Dead', 'Line', 'lift', 'series', 'nearly', 'everything', 'else', 'TV', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'always', 'enough', 'feed', 'fan', 'already', 'high', 'expectations', 'series', 'delivered', 'last', 'time', 'shaky', 'second', 'season', 'really', 'delivered', 'best', 'entertainment', 'around', 'next', '3', 'seasons.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Angel', 'fantastic', 'classic', 'piece', 'programming', 'season', '2', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'example', 'complete', 'anyone', 'collection', 'must', 'first', 'time', 'viewers', 'other', 'series', 'show', 'are', 'better', 'introduction', 'why', 'so', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'TV', 'boxsets', 'commentaries', 'documentaries', 'are', 'genuinely', 'insightful', 'better', 'most', ""'ll"", 'find', 'there', 'compared', 'what', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'can', 'normally', 'pull', 'off', ""n't"", 'quite', 'cut']",Angel - Season Two

Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 3]","The first season of Angel, a spin off of Joss Whedon's wildly popular series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was rough around the edges to say the least.  Season 2 of Angel saw the series begin to find it's own footing, setting itself apart from it's counterpart program.  Tortured vampire Angel (David Boreanaz), along with Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) and Wesley (Alexis Denisof) are joined by vampire street fighter Gunn (J. August Richards) as Angel Investigations upgrades to a run down L.A. hotel.  Naturally though, things don't stay peaceful for long; as the demonic law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart resurrects Angel's old love Darla (Julie Benz) who is made a vampire once again by her old cohort Drusilla (Juliet Landau) and Angel finds himself lured away from his team (get all that?).  This is when the show began to show signs of being something really special.  Just as Whedon's Buffy had began perfection in the middle of it's second season, Angel began to show the same signs of life and out grow it's growing pains; until the much dismissed by some and well liked by others storyarc taking place in the demon dimension of Pylea where the gang finds themselves trapped.  It shouldn't have come close to working, but thanks to Whedon's creative team of writers it did, and the cast themselves began to soar when the green skinned, horned, karaoke loving demon Lorne (Andy Hallett) and trapped pysicist Fred (Amy Acker) are introduced.  Though it's not perfect, the second season of Angel is some of the best TV to be seen, and the hilarious episode entitled &quot;Disharmony&quot;, where newly vampiric Harmony (Mercedes McNabb) pays the crew a visit, is worth the price of admission alone.",4,Beginning to stand on it's own,1085011200,"05 20, 2004",2004,1695,"['first', 'season', 'Angel', 'spin', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'wildly', 'popular', 'series', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'was', 'rough', 'edges', 'say', 'least', 'Season', '2', 'Angel', 'saw', 'series', 'begin', 'find', 'own', 'footing', 'setting', 'apart', 'counterpart', 'program', 'Tortured', 'vampire', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'Wesley', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'are', 'joined', 'vampire', 'street', 'fighter', 'Gunn', 'J.', 'August', 'Richards', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'run', 'down', 'L.A.', 'hotel', 'Naturally', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'peaceful', 'long', 'demonic', 'law', 'firm', 'Wolfram', 'amp', 'Hart', 'Angel', 'old', 'love', 'Darla', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'who', 'made', 'vampire', 'once', 'again', 'old', 'cohort', 'Drusilla', 'Juliet', 'Landau', 'Angel', 'lured', 'away', 'team', 'get', 'when', 'show', 'began', 'show', 'signs', 'being', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'Just', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'had', 'began', 'perfection', 'middle', 'second', 'season', 'Angel', 'began', 'show', 'same', 'signs', 'life', 'grow', 'growing', 'pains', 'much', 'dismissed', 'well', 'liked', 'others', 'storyarc', 'taking', 'place', 'demon', 'dimension', 'Pylea', 'where', 'gang', 'trapped', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'close', 'working', 'thanks', 'Whedon', 'creative', 'team', 'writers', 'did', 'cast', 'began', 'soar', 'when', 'green', 'skinned', 'horned', 'karaoke', 'loving', 'demon', 'Lorne', 'Andy', 'Hallett', 'trapped', 'pysicist', 'Fred', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'are', 'introduced', 'not', 'perfect', 'second', 'season', 'Angel', 'best', 'TV', 'be', 'seen', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Disharmony', 'quot', 'where', 'newly', 'vampiric', 'Harmony', 'Mercedes', 'McNabb', 'crew', 'visit', 'price', 'admission', 'alone']",Angel - Season Two

749547,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00008YGRT,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[2, 4]","Call me crazy, but Season Two of the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" spin-off, which chronicles the un-life of her former lover Angel is my favourite. From what I've seen in chat rooms and forums, most people tend to favour Season Three as the best season of the five-season series, but for a variety of reasons, Season Two remains closest to my heart. Reaching the perfect blend of individual storylines (with a mystery to be solved in each episode) with overarching storylines (the impact a former love has on the life of our protagonist), Season Two was filled with suspense, humour, poignancy, intrigue and drama that blended together into a near-perfect whole.In a nutshell: Angel is a vampire who was once known as Angelus, a vicious vampire that spread terror and misery around the world. But after killing a gypsy girl, he is cursed by her clan and has his soul restored to him. Now plagued by guilt, Angel commits his immortal life to defending the innocent in the hopes of making amends for an eternity of evil-doing. There is a slight catch; the gypsy curse had a clause to it - that if he ever experienced a moment of pure happiness (for the gypsies wanted him to suffer under the burden of a soul, not enjoy the benefits that it brings) then once again he would loose his soul and revert back to the evil Angelus. This is precisely what happened when he found love in the arms of the Vampire Slayer Buffy - and his spin-off begins when he decides not to place her in any further danger from his presence, leaving for L.A. to form a supernatural detective agency: Angel Investigations.He is joined by another Sunnydale residence; Cordelia Chase, once a spoilt prom-queen, now learning to live life without a credit card - and who has been recently been burdened with de-habilitating visions that reveal people who need Angel's help (a parting gift from the third original member of the team; the half-demon Doyle), and Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, an ex-Watcher who now comes into his own as a leader, warrior and bookman of the team. Charles Gunn is made a regular: a demon street fighter whose little sister was turned into a vampire and killed by his own hand. Struggling between the opportunities and benefits that Angel's team offers him and his loyalties to his gang, he soon becomes a regular member of the team; and last of all we meet the Host (later given a proper name, Lorne) the demon manager of a karaoke bar who can read people's auras when he hears them sing. He's a great character, funny and warm - and his special gift leads to some humourous moments when Angel is required to sing.In the final moments of the final episode of Season One, two new revelations were laid on the table for further exploration throughout Season Two. The first was the discovery of the Shanshu Prophesy, an ancient scroll that promised Angel would one day play a crucial part in a coming apocalypse - and be rewarded with humanity as a result. A ray of light has suddenly come into Angel's life; the promise of an end to his endless existence as a vampire - but how long can it last? Season Two explores Angel's dark side; not as Angelus, but as an individual who chooses to throw away his ties to humanity in order to better fight the endless battle against evil.Second is the return of his old lover Darla, the female vampire who first turned the mortal Liam into a vampire, wrecked havoc with him throughout the centuries, and was finally staked by her former-love in the first season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". Now resurrected by the evil law firm Wolfram and Hart in an attempt to distract, distance and corrupt Angel, Darla delights in playing twisted mind games with her former love. But there's a catch: Darla has been brought back as a human being, and along with that comes the burden of a soul. Torn between trying to save the woman who granted him eternal life and preventing her from seeking out the vampiric life once more, Angel is confronted by demons of his past (literal *and* figurative ones) in attempting to take responsibility for her.Finally, in the Season's four final episodes we are treated to a mini-movie in which Angel and the gang journey into Lorne's home-dimension of Pylea in order to rescue Cordelia and a young woman named Winifred `Fred' Burkle, who - like Cordelia - has accidentally been swept up in a portal and deposited in a world where humans are slaves. There are mixed feelings about how successful this four-parter was (some love it, some find it a bit too cartoony) but in doing so most miss its real importance: during Angel's time in Pylea, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was facing its latest apocalypse, one that ended in Buffy's death. Angel had to be removed entirely from the picture in order to account for his absence in the fight against Glory (if he had just been hanging out in L.A., one would have to seriously question why 1. Buffy didn't call him for reinforcements, and 2. Why he didn't go to help out regardless).As well as this, there are new headquarters for the team; the Hyperion Hotel (which is introduced in the brilliant flashback episode ""Are You Now, Or Have You Ever Been""), an end to the story arcs of Kate Lockley and Lindsay McDonald (that culminates in an evil hand; don't ask and don't worry - he'll be back!), a visit from a couple of ""Buffy"" stars, namely Willow and Harmony, the beginning of Cordelia's struggle with her painful visions and the first hints that the AI gang may be under a higher destiny: story-seeds are strewn throughout the Season that are not brought to proper fruition until Season Four.I know I'm in the severe minority when I say that Season Two is my favourite, but it's packed filled with great episodes (to my mind, every one of them is quality entertainment) and serves to catapult the series forward (with its many moments of foreshadowing) whilst still standing firmly on its own two feet.",5,"""The Same Love

749548,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00008YGRT,Robert Moore,"[0, 2]","These releases of ANGEL in new thinpak editions is very welcome.  I own a large number of television shows on DVD, but the original packaging for ANGEL was definitely among the worse.  Almost all of the discs in all five sets have a tendency to pop of the packaging, resulting in loose discs and in a couple of cases some scratching.  These new thinpak versions should take care of all the problems.  But not only are these being released in superior packaging; they are bargained priced as well.Warning: Season Five spoilers do appear below.Season One of ANGEL found the show trying to establish itself, its moods, its major characters, its bad guys, and its story arcs. For a first season, it was not at all a bad show; it was, in fact, quite good. But it didn't truly match the high standards set by BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. In Season Two, however, Angel Investigations truly came into its own. It moved from a spin off finding its own rhythm, to a truly superb show in its own right. It also became one of the darkest shows in TV history, not quite as dark as MILLENNIUM, perhaps, but quite dark nonetheless.Every fan is going to rate the various seasons based to a degree on their own preferences, but for me this is the finest season in the entire run of the show.  Season Three was perhaps even better until the episode that introduced the grown up Connor, but that Intro unfortunately marred the final episodes of the season.Season Two is somewhat unusual in that it actually features two major plot lines. First, there is the stunning revelation that Wolfram and Hart has managed to resurrect, in fully human form, Angel's old love and sire Darla. Her return, use, and abuse by Wolfram and Hart constitutes most of the season's episodes. She is not the only character we first met in Buffy to guest on the second season: Harmony, one of the original Cordettes, comes to LA to visit Cordy. The visit generates perhaps the funniest scene in the entire series, when Harmony, who unbeknownst to Cordelia is now a vampire, is barely able to resist feeding off her in her sleep. When Cordelia wakes up just in time, she wrongly thinks that Harmony was now gay. The ensuing conversation of errors is hysterical. Harmony would return in Season Five as Angel's secretary when he took over leadership of Wolfram and Hart.The Darla story line is a dark one, with tragic circumstances thwarting Angel's attempts to lead Darla to the path of righteousness, and seems to succeed, even when Darla learns that she is doomed to die as a mortal. His involvement with Darla leads to Angel breaking off his involvement with Cordelia, Wesley, and Gunn. Much of the interpersonal dynamics of the entire season revolve around Angel's alienation from his friends, and his gradual restoration of their friendship.The other major plot line of the second season involves first Cordelia and then the others traveling to the dimension of Pylea. Now, I liked these episodes myself, but there is little question that for a huge number of fans, these are among the least popular episodes in the history of the Buffyverse. For the series as a whole, the most important thing to come out of this arc is the rescue of Fred, a brilliant physics student who had been accidentally trapped there. Despite Cordy, the show had until them had an overwhelmingly male feel to it. In season three, as Fred becomes an integral part of Angel Investigations, she brings a crucial element to the show's chemistry.Two other major developments take place in Season Two. First, the introduction of the character of The Host aka Lorne, a demon from another dimension (actually, Pylea, we later learn) who can read anyone's aura when they sing. Hence, he is the owner of a karaoke bar. Lorne would later be elevated from supporting character to a permanent character. The other major change, and one crucial to the ambiance of the series, was Angel Investigation's moving into an abandoned hotel. I liked this setting so much that I am going to miss it tremendously as we move into Season Five.All in all, Season Two represents a major achievement by a team that seems to be incapable of producing a less than remarkable product. And, of course, the set is essential for any lover of things Buffy/Angel.",5,ANGEL puts it all together for an absolutely stellar second season,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,4259,"['releases', 'ANGEL', 'new', 'thinpak', 'editions', 'very', 'welcome', 'own', 'large', 'number', 'television', 'shows', 'DVD', 'original', 'packaging', 'ANGEL', 'was', 'definitely', 'worse', 'Almost', 'discs', 'five', 'sets', 'have', 'tendency', 'pop', 'packaging', 'resulting', 'loose', 'discs', 'couple', 'cases', 'scratching', 'new', 'thinpak', 'versions', 'should', 'take', 'care', 'problems', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'superior', 'packaging', 'are', 'bargained', 'priced', 'well.Warning', 'Season', 'Five', 'spoilers', 'do', 'appear', 'One', 'ANGEL', 'found', 'show', 'trying', 'establish', 'moods', 'major', 'characters', 'bad', 'guys', 'story', 'arcs', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'show', 'was', 'fact', 'quite', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'truly', 'match', 'high', 'standards', 'set', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'Season', 'Two', 'however', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'truly', 'came', 'own', 'moved', 'spin', 'off', 'finding', 'own', 'rhythm', 'truly', 'superb', 'show', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'became', 'one', 'darkest', 'shows', 'TV', 'history', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'dark', 'MILLENNIUM', 'perhaps', 'quite', 'dark', 'nonetheless.Every', 'fan', 'going', 'rate', 'various', 'seasons', 'based', 'degree', 'own', 'preferences', 'finest', 'season', 'entire', 'run', 'show', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'episode', 'introduced', 'grown', 'up', 'Connor', 'Intro', 'unfortunately', 'marred', 'final', 'episodes', 'season.Season', 'Two', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'actually', 'two', 'major', 'plot', 'lines', 'First', 'stunning', 'revelation', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'managed', 'resurrect', 'fully', 'human', 'form', 'Angel', 'old', 'love', 'sire', 'Darla', 'return', 'use', 'abuse', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'most', 'season', 'episodes', 'not', 'only', 'character', 'first', 'met', 'Buffy', 'guest', 'second', 'season', 'Harmony', 'one', 'original', 'Cordettes', 'LA', 'visit', 'Cordy', 'visit', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'scene', 'entire', 'series', 'when', 'Harmony', 'who', 'unbeknownst', 'Cordelia', 'now', 'vampire', 'barely', 'able', 'resist', 'feeding', 'off', 'sleep', 'When', 'Cordelia', 'up', 'just', 'time', 'wrongly', 'Harmony', 'was', 'now', 'gay', 'ensuing', 'conversation', 'errors', 'hysterical', 'Harmony', 'would', 'return', 'Season', 'Five', 'Angel', 'secretary', 'when', 'took', 'over', 'leadership', 'Wolfram', 'Hart.The', 'Darla', 'story', 'line', 'dark', 'one', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'thwarting', 'Angel', 'attempts', 'lead', 'Darla', 'path', 'righteousness', 'succeed', 'even', 'when', 'Darla', 'doomed', 'die', 'mortal', 'involvement', 'Darla', 'Angel', 'breaking', 'off', 'involvement', 'Cordelia', 'Wesley', 'Gunn', 'Much', 'interpersonal', 'dynamics', 'entire', 'season', 'revolve', 'Angel', 'alienation', 'friends', 'gradual', 'restoration', 'friendship.The', 'other', 'major', 'plot', 'line', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'Cordelia', 'then', 'others', 'traveling', 'dimension', 'Pylea', 'Now', 'liked', 'episodes', 'little', 'question', 'huge', 'number', 'fans', 'are', 'least', 'popular', 'episodes', 'history', 'Buffyverse', 'series', 'whole', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'come', 'arc', 'rescue', 'Fred', 'brilliant', 'physics', 'student', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'accidentally', 'trapped', 'there', 'Cordy', 'show', 'had', 'had', 'overwhelmingly', 'male', 'feel', 'season', 'three', 'Fred', 'integral', 'part', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'crucial', 'element', 'show', 'chemistry.Two', 'other', 'major', 'developments', 'take', 'place', 'Season', 'Two', 'First', 'introduction', 'character', 'Host', 'aka', 'Lorne', 'demon', 'dimension', 'actually', 'Pylea', 'later', 'learn', 'who', 'can', 'read', 'anyone', 'aura', 'when', 'sing', 'Hence', 'owner', 'karaoke', 'bar', 'Lorne', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'elevated', 'supporting', 'character', 'permanent', 'character', 'other', 'major', 'change', 'one', 'crucial', 'ambiance', 'series', 'was', 'Angel', 'Investigation', 'moving', 'abandoned', 'hotel', 'liked', 'setting', 'so', 'much', 'am', 'going', 'miss', 'tremendously', 'move', 'Season', 'Five.All', 'Season', 'Two', 'major', 'achievement', 'team', 'be', 'incapable', 'producing', 'less', 'remarkable', 'product', 'course', 'set', 'essential', 'lover', 'things', 'Buffy/Angel']",Angel - Season Two
749549,A29CWGLEAS9AUN,B00008YGRT,"R. Seehausen ""aeroblaster2""","[91, 95]","Angel: Season 2 was where the show started to move into its own 'formula', and the opening statement that Angel himself was not devastated by the loss of Buffy served to encompase one fact: the show was on its own.Where the first season essentially followed the monster-of-the-week plus occasional storyline episode formula that has been tried and true on Buffy, Season 2 started to move away from that into the darker, emotionally churning state of being that we viewers have grown so used to in the third and fourth seasons.The second season of Angel also points at the show's tendency to serve an overarching plot rather than a seasonal ""Big Bad"", when it ends with a trip to a different dimension instead of concluding the Darla storyline (which is completed in the third season).But though this season has a darker, more plot-arc oriented spine, it still contains some excellent character and monster-of-the-week episodes.  One of these is ""Are You Now or Were You Ever?"", thought by fans everywhere as being one of the best episodes of the show.  Other greats include ""Darla"", ""Guise will Beguise"", and ""The Shroud of Rahmon"".There are also portents of the futures of the different characters interspersed throughout the season. This is where Wesley really matured, becoming a hard-bitten leader rather than a comical sidekick. You can see his character being prepared to make the harder choices that cause him to be so dark later on in the series.Angel himself has a hard time of it throughout this season, but then, when does he not?  He grows dark, deep-set despair keeping him from both his mission and his friends.  But his redemption is both funny and touching when he returns towards the end of the season.Cordelia grows immensely during this season, primarily because of her visions. She's still ""tell it like it is"" Cordy, but her caring for others grows by leaps and bounds, setting the stage for the Cordelia we know later on in the third season.Charles Gunn also joins the Fang Gang, forsaking his old 'crew' to help Angel Investigations in a slow process that is (fortunately) very believable.Also in this season we are introduced to two new characters that will later become regulars: Fred and Lorne (the Host). The first is a slightly cooky, very intelligent woman who was stuck in Pylea for five years before returning with the Angel Investigations gang. The second, Lorne, is a truly unique character - a demon that sings, and can read a person's destiny when that person sings. Both are excellent additions to the group, and help to flesh out the dynamic between the characters.In conclusion, Angel: Season 2 serves as a stage-setter for the third and fourth seasons' storylines and characters, and contains some truly memorable episodes as well.",5,On its own... at last,1050796800,"04 20, 2003",2003,2770,"['Angel', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'where', 'show', 'started', 'move', 'own', ""'formula"", 'opening', 'statement', 'Angel', 'was', 'not', 'devastated', 'loss', 'Buffy', 'served', 'encompase', 'one', 'fact', 'show', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'essentially', 'followed', 'monster-of-the-week', 'occasional', 'storyline', 'episode', 'formula', 'been', 'tried', 'true', 'Buffy', 'Season', '2', 'started', 'move', 'away', 'darker', 'emotionally', 'churning', 'state', 'being', 'viewers', 'have', 'grown', 'so', 'used', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons.The', 'second', 'season', 'Angel', 'also', 'show', 'tendency', 'serve', 'overarching', 'plot', 'rather', 'seasonal', 'Big', 'Bad', 'when', 'trip', 'different', 'dimension', 'instead', 'concluding', 'Darla', 'storyline', 'completed', 'third', 'season', 'season', 'darker', 'more', 'plot-arc', 'oriented', 'spine', 'still', 'excellent', 'character', 'monster-of-the-week', 'episodes', 'One', 'Are', 'Now', 'Were', 'Ever', 'thought', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'show', 'Other', 'greats', 'include', 'Darla', 'Guise', 'will', 'Beguise', 'Shroud', 'Rahmon', 'are', 'also', 'portents', 'futures', 'different', 'characters', 'interspersed', 'season', 'where', 'Wesley', 'really', 'matured', 'becoming', 'hard-bitten', 'leader', 'rather', 'comical', 'sidekick', 'can', 'see', 'character', 'being', 'prepared', 'make', 'harder', 'choices', 'cause', 'be', 'so', 'dark', 'later', 'series.Angel', 'hard', 'time', 'season', 'then', 'when', 'not', 'dark', 'deep-set', 'despair', 'keeping', 'mission', 'friends', 'redemption', 'funny', 'touching', 'when', 'end', 'season.Cordelia', 'immensely', 'season', 'primarily', 'visions', 'still', 'tell', 'Cordy', 'caring', 'others', 'grows', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'setting', 'stage', 'Cordelia', 'know', 'later', 'third', 'season.Charles', 'Gunn', 'also', 'Fang', 'Gang', 'forsaking', 'old', ""'crew"", 'help', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'slow', 'process', 'fortunately', 'very', 'believable.Also', 'season', 'are', 'introduced', 'two', 'new', 'characters', 'will', 'later', 'become', 'regulars', 'Fred', 'Lorne', 'Host', 'first', 'slightly', 'cooky', 'very', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'stuck', 'Pylea', 'five', 'years', 'returning', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'gang', 'second', 'Lorne', 'truly', 'unique', 'character', 'demon', 'sings', 'can', 'read', 'person', 'destiny', 'when', 'person', 'sings', 'are', 'excellent', 'additions', 'group', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'dynamic', 'characters.In', 'conclusion', 'Angel', 'Season', '2', 'serves', 'stage-setter', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'storylines', 'characters', 'truly', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'well']",Angel - Season Two
749550,A3252E3EF9YOKI,B00008YGRT,"Sanis1 ""sanis1""","[0, 0]","Angel was marvelous during its Second Season.  Probably the best season of Angel to date (excluding current season).  The mixture of the dramatic (Angel's quest for redemption sidetracted) with the comedic (Wesley's and Cord's relationship) was the best since the days of M.A.S.H.  The show plays on the history of the Angel's character in flashback scenes and sets the seeds for his demise without reverting back to Angelus by reintroducing the Darla character (who Sired Angel and then later killed by him, talk about your Fruadian tale).  Not only is Angel's quest very evident throught the season but it takes on a stronger role when Darla comes back human and is dying as well.  Angel's fight for her soul in one episode is probably one of the best shows of the season.  Add to this Dru's appearances after Darla is changed back into a vampire and the season explodes by the middle of the season.  At one point Angel's lowest point is also his most spectacular.  While this is all going on, the other members of the team (Wes, Cordy &amp; Gunn) create a new bond.  The season then ends with a great 2 parter that introduces a new character (Fred) and fully develops another (Lorn).  The season is the best from the moments of Angel signing to the flashbacks (including Spike, Dru &amp; Darla's time during the Boxer Rebellion).  The season is highlighted by Angel's quest to his demise and ends up with the revelation that Angel cannot continue on his quest without his friends.

However, when he allows a massacre to take place at the hands of our good friend Drusilla and Darla, the gang expresses their feelings about the situation and he responds by saying something Donald Trump is very good at: 'You're fired.'

749554,A2WS9FE0NRXAFB,B00008YGRT,Shi Feng,"[4, 10]","This season is the true beginning of Angel, and I just want to point out a few things:a lot of people said they don't like Darla, I think this is because Darla took a lot of Angel's time, but HELLO, she's actually a very important character, she's Angel's maker for cryin' out loud. And Darla is the strength of this season. and frankly, the placement of Darla really brings out DB's acting talents. If you watched season one and still says he's not that good an actor, season two WILL make you change your mind. I'm gonna point out the episodes that are the best:Are you now or have you ever been- my all time favorite of Angel's flashbacks. We get to see Angel's reserveness without seeing his patheticness- like we did in Buffy. And also I have to say that the 50s wardrobe is THE BEST look of all Angel's flashbacks. (the worst is the 70s in season four, bleech! I seriously don't believe Angel would wear that). And I love how this episodes puts a little bit of private eye mystery but it's still supernatural in the end.Dear Boy- I love how Angel played right into Darla's hands yet still remains her formatible foe. the conversation between Angel and Darla in the water tank place is just absolutely glorious. Darla's ""Look, no matter how good a boy you are, God doesn't want you, but I still do"" makes me wanna scream my insides out. this powerful line just sums up all of Angel's pain and suffering. even if this episode is all crap (which it isn't of course), this line would make me score a 5/5 for this episode, not to mention rest of the conversation.Guise Will be Guise- my GAWD, this is probably THE MOST FUNNIEST episode of Angel. Wesley posing as Angel just points out all the sterotypes of Angel's character and reminded us why we love Angel, and from it, Wesley.Darla- Another really powerful Angel and Darla episode. And Angel's most memorable line "" favor? is that what you think? you did me a favor.. You Damned me"" just completely couples with Darla's line about god doesn't want him. Also the flashbacks were very well done meshing with the present. The only complain I have is the China flashback one. I mean, THAT'S China in the 1900s? PLEASE! I actually do know what my mother country looks like during that time, and it looks like anything but THAT! I guess the producers were too broke to actually do THROUGH research. what's with the you see more foreigner than Chinse people??? And the baby that Angel is suppose is kill to prove himself, I think the baby is suppose to be Chinese, since Darla said they ""praying to THEIR God for salvation"" But I guess Joss can't find a Chinese couple actors and baby in time.The Trial- Like the Trinity sister said, Angel half naked, in chains, on knees, in tears.. What could go wrong?? This is also the FIRST time Angel really lose it, usually he's calm, gentle, and snaps at the right time, but never lose in to his anger. The bittersweet ending where Angel saves Darla from herself but couldn't save her fully, promise to be at her side until she dies, then got taken away again just brings more conflict and brilliancy to the show.Reunion- this episode should really be called: be careful what you wish for. W&H; wanted Angel dark, but they just didn't know how dark Angel would get; W&H; want to help Darla and Drusilla to do whatevery they want, look what comes out of it. And Angel's darkest moments where he repeats Holland's remark, closes the door and lock the lawyer in makes me chill to the bone, but I also totally applauded. This is why I love Angel, that he's not easily controlled or played by evildoers, and that just because he's a good guy doesn't mean that he would be all soft and merciful.Redefinition- Angel firing his crew and his crew throwing the blame around is truly funny and pathetic. and Angel locking the lawyers compares nothing to his lighting up Darla and Drusilla like a christmas tree. God I love it when Angel is Dark.Reprise- I'm almost lost for words discribing David's performance in this episode. He should seriously win an Oscar for it. I mean, when he came out of the elevator and had that terrifying and despair at the same time look on him, he stole my heart, my heart was out and I was ready to bow down and cry: "" you are a damn good actor!"" and I love the tag where Angel had sex with Darla, using her as a prostitute, how can Angel posses sooo much grace even when doing a terrible thing???Epiphany- NOOOOO I want Dark Angel baaaaack!!!! But this is an important episode because Angel finally reveals why he was soooo obsessed with Darla and what made him turn to the Dark side. And Angel made his first most important speech at the end. But the part where Angel trying soooo hard to please his friends so to  renew their friendship is a little bit hard to watch. Because it doesn't look like it's something Angel would do. But I guess since Angel doesn't have an arrogance problem it is kind of like something he would do, who knows???Angel then became jumpy and outgoing from here, which I didn't like as much as him dark. there was one other thing I didn't get satisfied about this season- Angel's pure form. I mean, common! THAT'S Angel's pure form???? Angel's pure form is suppose to be terrifying, you know, BEAUTIFUL in a TERRIFYING way, not some guy in a green halloween costume. And what's with the Green??? like there aren't enough green monsters in Pylea they just had to add another one. I mean, I know it's probably because the producers are kinda broke from doing the Pylea set, but Angel's pure form!!! it's really important!!!! Angel's pure form should be kind of like Van Helsing's Dracula monster look; he should at least grow five feet or somethin'. All in all, I don't agree that this season is one of Angel's weakest, weakest should be season three or four, not this one.",5,One of the finest moments of Angel,1112227200,"03 31,

749556,AMNJJ9VAQEA86,B00008YGRT,Spunk Monkey,"[4, 8]","The overwhelmingly positive notations about the second season of Angel fail to mesh with my personal fealings. The first season was an amazing departure from Buffy, and, by its seond half, superior to Buffy's fourth seasons second half. The reasons for its sucess were, to my taste, a refreshingly dark, moody, horrific tang with a dash of irony and some gut renching emotional pathos, not to mention exciting Buffy crossovers that did not limit and muzzle the show, but intertextualized it in a way I had never experienced before. By the second season, the oppresive feelings are gone and replaced by a sloopy goofiness, with limp, and sparce, attempts at emotional resonance coinciding with monster mash style cheese and, though there are some crossovers, no intertextualization with Buffy.Cordy, Gunn, and Wesley are unfortunetly relegated into the roles of comicly daft characatures. Wesley at this point is totally without the intellectual authority and charasmatic air of a Giles; Cordy is just annoying; and Gunn becomes Mr. Token Black Actor.And the show is just sloppy. Watch the numerous crowd scenes, with the bored looking extras standing there looking innapropriate (guards, monsters with silly faces, the Wolfram and Hardt executives). The creature world, nicely expanded in the Angel season 1, showing us their world in a way Buffy had as yet not (Buffy-monster as other/Angel-monster as grey area), and second season Angel just gets silly with the goofball humor.Introduced are numerous characters that are boring to the point of criminal (Weselys girlfriend), the characters that are there are woefully under developed (what happened to cop ladys arc?), the shows tone comes crashing down from its wonderful previous season inky blackness, and the guy who plays the young Wolfram and Hart lawyer is just plain poor (and does anyone seriously believe that he would fall for Darla!?!).In the first time in the linear span of watching Joss Whedons shows (buffy 1,2,3,4 + Angel 1) I started to get the feeling that I was watching an afternoon kids show instead of the postmodern fests that stood on towering grandeous pillars of irony assembled from the rubble of contrivances and cliche blasted from television and cinema and reassembled into a pleasure that was both intellectual and emotional.Even the best episodes are marred. For instance, Redefinition. In a stab at Taxi Driver, we had Angel shown in montage sequence preparing himself for violence by training in small, claustrophobic cellars and sewers. In monologe, Angel says something like &quot;too many days sleeping in soft beds, I'm not ready.&quot; Then, maybe the next day, maybe later that night, he kills some vampires and proclaims prophetically &quot;I'm ready.&quot; Oh, so you only needed to train intensively for a war for, hhmmmmm, maybe two or three days? Since thats how long it had been since (spoiler) Cordy, Gunn, Wesely had been fired. It's just alot of stuff like that, that taken independently, isn't too bothersome, but in a bombardment of attrition, adds up to some gaping maws in our suspension of disbelief.Not to paint to shabby a portrait, Angel season 2 is still better than just about anything on tv (Better than Alias for sure) or cable (better than Carnival but I wouldn't say Six Feet Under or Sopranos). The season finale, with Angel and crew propelled into a parallel universe, was a desperate, and sucessful attempt to save the entire season from mediocraty; it leaves one with a pleasant taste after swallowing so much chaff. The rather too brief return of Dru had her at her best, really bumping up the amps of the episodes she was in. I also enjoyed the IDEA of Angels moral ambiguities, though the execution was a different matter. The unsurfaced details of his relationship with Darla are amazing and reveal that Buffy, instead of the love of a lifetime (200 and forty odd years) was actually just a rebound/footnote to Angels much more dynamic, destructive, addictive relationship with Darla. More could have been done with the idea that Darla had reformed and resigned herself to a peaceful human life with Angel until she sucummed to syphalis, but this potentionally heart wrending situation is just tagged onto the end of The Trial (with Darla being turned while Angel is (yeah right) supposedly being restrained by a few measly humans- come on, he could had ripped those guys up!). At Buffy's and Angel's pinnacle, I could make my case that they ARE the best things on tv, and even with this season 2 downturn, I still dig it like heck. Your always hardest on those things you love and my review is holding Angel to a standard few shows could reach, but Angel should. Not having seen seasons 3, 4, or 5 or Angel, lets hope they couldn't keep a good (well, sometimes) vampire down...",3,"Angel stumbles, flounders; though still essential.",1070496000,"12 4,

749560,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00008YGRT,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[1, 4]","For the first season, Angel struggled with a basic problem. Angel is a dour mope feeling guilty about his past unless he's evil and then he's fun. That worked great on Buffy when he was a supporting character but on a show where he's the main character, you're going to have to do more than whine for 22 episodes (or 21.5 episodes with one show devoted to an Angelus fake-out.)Season two of Angel solved this problem with a roomful of dead lawyers. Or a roomful of live lawyers expecting Angel to save them from two very nasty vampires that they created themselves. When Angel locks the door and lets the lawyers of Wolfram & Hart die, the show turned much much darker. Angel wasn't just dour. He was really cranky.Now that storyline falls in the middle as the culmination of the Angel being driven nuts by Wolfram & Hart (and Darla) storyline, but it's the part that I always remember. Especially since they gave Boreanaz to play Angel as a goof ball once the cranky revenge personality wore off. However the rest of the season worked as well especially the Haunted Hotel episode with tributes to Rebel Without a Cause and the Pylea episodes at the end, that felt like Army of Darkness ripoffs, but proved that more than one medium can parody the medeival fantasy.Furthermore, Angel's supporting cast got more interesting. Cordelia and Wesley were holdovers from Buffy but they managed to find more depth in their roles (although Wesley's endless whining about his uptight father really got old) and the introduction of Gunn (the vigilante vampire hunter) and Lorne (the green demon karaoke singer) centered the show in Los Angeles to the point where Lorne's final speech at the end of the season that takes place in the medieval Pylea serves as a tribute to Los Angeles as a place full of people that just don't belong anywhere else.The season begins with a dour Angel playing the hero and puts Angel through so many changes that by the end of it, you know the character but you don't know him either. That made for great television and great repeat viewing.One caveat - if you have a dark television set, the DVD doesn't really clean up a lot of the shots and you could find yourself watching black bears fighting in a coal mine since it is a vampire show and it takes place at night.",5,The Season that made the show work as a show,1140652800,"02 23, 2006",2006,2287,"['first', 'season', 'Angel', 'struggled', 'basic', 'problem', 'Angel', 'dour', 'mope', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'past', 'evil', 'then', 'fun', 'worked', 'great', 'Buffy', 'when', 'was', 'supporting', 'character', 'show', 'where', 'main', 'character', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'do', 'more', 'whine', '22', 'episodes', '21.5', 'episodes', 'one', 'show', 'devoted', 'Angelus', 'fake-out', 'Season', 'two', 'Angel', 'solved', 'problem', 'roomful', 'dead', 'lawyers', 'roomful', 'live', 'lawyers', 'expecting', 'Angel', 'save', 'two', 'very', 'nasty', 'vampires', 'created', 'When', 'Angel', 'door', 'lawyers', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'die', 'show', 'turned', 'much', 'much', 'darker', 'Angel', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'dour', 'was', 'really', 'cranky.Now', 'storyline', 'middle', 'culmination', 'Angel', 'being', 'driven', 'nuts', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'Darla', 'storyline', 'part', 'always', 'remember', 'Especially', 'gave', 'Boreanaz', 'play', 'Angel', 'goof', 'ball', 'cranky', 'revenge', 'personality', 'wore', 'off', 'However', 'rest', 'season', 'worked', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'Haunted', 'Hotel', 'episode', 'tributes', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'Pylea', 'episodes', 'end', 'felt', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'ripoffs', 'proved', 'more', 'one', 'medium', 'can', 'parody', 'medeival', 'fantasy.Furthermore', 'Angel', 'supporting', 'cast', 'got', 'more', 'interesting', 'Cordelia', 'Wesley', 'were', 'holdovers', 'Buffy', 'managed', 'find', 'more', 'depth', 'roles', 'Wesley', 'endless', 'whining', 'uptight', 'father', 'really', 'got', 'old', 'introduction', 'Gunn', 'vigilante', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'Lorne', 'green', 'demon', 'karaoke', 'singer', 'centered', 'show', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'point', 'where', 'Lorne', 'final', 'speech', 'end', 'season', 'place', 'medieval', 'Pylea', 'tribute', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'place', 'full', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'anywhere', 'else.The', 'season', 'dour', 'Angel', 'playing', 'hero', 'Angel', 'so', 'many', 'changes', 'end', 'know', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'either', 'made', 'great', 'television', 'great', 'repeat', 'viewing.One', 'caveat', 'have', 'dark', 'television', 'set', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'really', 'clean', 'up', 'lot', 'shots', 'could', 'find', 'watching', 'black', 'bears', 'fighting', 'coal', 'mine', 'vampire', 'show', 'place', 'night']",Angel - Season Two

Anyways it's about the same, since they both have the same producer, Angel could be like Buffy only from a guy's perspective. However they are both definitely related to one another. If you enjoyed Buffy you could try watching this show, however both shows take a awhile to develop, or can be repetitious in their patterns of development.
