765601,ASN36IA89EBD6,B0000APVF8,Marco,"[3, 25]","This series is hokey rubbish, and at the same time it takes itself WAY too seriously, like its High Art, or something.I started watching it on TV because I went to the same gym as Daniel Goddard, the muscle-bound star who plays Dar. (Cronulla Gym, then when it changed owners, Hotbods at Miranda, both in Sydney's southern suburbs.) Hey, that's right ... Daniel Goddard is Australian. Couldn't you tell from his appalling attempt at and American accent? By the way, Big Dan was a total arrogant *%$# when I used to see him at the gym (1991 - 1996), way before his 'acting' days had begun; he would strut around the place like he was a god, throwing skinny guys off machines that he wanted to use. (""Excuse me, mate, would you mind getting off that, I gotta do a Super Set""). I can imagine what he's like now. So girls, keep giving this !#@* a swollen head with your salavating comments, I'm sure he's soaking it up.Anyway, back to my review, and some more interesting trivia. This TV show was made at Movie World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The Gold Coast is a mixture of Waikiki, Miami and Las Vegas, (but with only one casino). This tends to show through in the general look of the show. Glitzy, fake and arrogant would describe the show's look quite well. The outdoor scenes were shot in the national parks and rainforests behind the Gold Coast, and if you look carefully, you can spot the Eucalyptus trees that make up the rainforest canopy. It looks pretty silly having dark age barbarians running around the Aussie bush.Which brings me to the reason why Big Dan is the star of the show. Apparently, they needed someone who was an Aussie citizen to be the star, due to our actor's union laws etc. Dan won out due to his body, not his acting ability. Incidently, when I was seeing Dan at the gym (and he must have lived there, as he was there every night I was there, no matter what night it was) all those years ago, he was FAT FAT FAT covering the muscle. He was huge, yes lots of muscle, but mainly fat. He obviously lost a vast amount of weight to audition for this show. He actually looks too thin compared to how he used to be like.If you want a good fantasy TV series, try Heath Ledger in Roar.

765603,A29R3O02O0PON4,B0000APVF8,"Razr Maxx ""Metal Head""","[19, 21]","With the release of Herc and Xena to DVD, I am gladly collecting them.  Xena seems like a little more serious and darker show than Herc, so I like it more, despite the fact that I'm a guy.  But anyway, so I sit there and watch Herc or Xena and I remember that there's this other show that's somewhat similar in nature (no pun intended) to both Herc and Xena...and that's Beastmaster.Beastmaster...I remember just checking out this series from time to time when it originally aired.  Saw it on the episode guide of DISH Network and would tune in just to see if I could get into it.  Unfortunately I couldn't.  I found Tao to be bit annoying and quite frankly silly.  So I never watched.  But like I said, after watching my Herc and Xena DVDs, I decided that I wanted more and decided to give this Beastmaster a try on DVD.  I can say happily that it was NOT a mistake.  This series is great (when seen from the beginning).  I guess my problem was just seeing a few scenes from Season 3 I think.What makes this series great is that there are season-long story arcs with numerous re-occuring characters that really contribute to some great continuity between episodes.  Now this isn't continuity as you would find on Deep Space Nine or Farscape, but continuity more in the way of Stargate SG-1 continuity.  Events or character development (mostly with the re-occuring characters) that would occur in previous episodes would be relevant in future episodes.  You didn't get this with Xena or Herc.  In fact, I really didn't see this with DS9.For example, Season 1 here basically has one story arc dealing with Dar's long lost love, Kyra, who has been imprisoned by King Zad and his Terrons of which of course leads to Dar's quest to free her.  Of course there's your filler episodes in between, but even still they contribute in someway to the over-all arc.The acting is better than average than your ordinary TV show of this genre.  Steven Grives who plays King Zad is excellently cast.  One of the better TV villains in quite a while.  The excellent casting among the guest stars is also a plus with this series.A note to Herc or Xena fans, this series is actually more serious than those two.  The fight scenes are a bit more graphic and realistic looking, despite the occasional wire-fu moves.  And as others have said here, the use of the animals and other guest stars at times do get emotional.  I even teared up a time or two.Special effects are decent.  CGI use is pretty realistic as compared to the goofy shots in Xena and Herc.These DVD sets come in those 6-disc amarray cases which I don't really care for actually, but I guess they're better than those multi-disc digipacks.  Technical specs are 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen which is very nice.  Image quality is top notch with the occasional grainy dark shot.  Sound however is just DD 2.0 which is a shame as this series would benefit greatly with a 5.1 track.  But even with that the 2.0 track is quite adequate with ambient sounds coming from the rear channels.So in summary, if you like Xena and Herc, and want more of the same fantasy genre...don't hesitate to dive into Beastmaster.  But shop around for the best price. ;)",5,"Like Herc & Xena, but better...if that's possible.",1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,3187,"['release', 'Herc', 'Xena', 'DVD', 'am', 'gladly', 'collecting', 'Xena', 'little', 'more', 'serious', 'darker', 'show', 'Herc', 'so', 'like', 'more', 'fact', ""'m"", 'guy', 'anyway', 'sit', 'there', 'watch', 'Herc', 'Xena', 'remember', 'other', 'show', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'nature', 'pun', 'intended', 'Herc', 'Xena', 'Beastmaster.Beastmaster', 'remember', 'just', 'checking', 'out', 'series', 'time', 'time', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'Saw', 'episode', 'guide', 'DISH', 'Network', 'would', 'tune', 'just', 'see', 'could', 'get', 'Unfortunately', 'could', ""n't"", 'found', 'Tao', 'be', 'bit', 'annoying', 'quite', 'frankly', 'silly', 'never', 'watched', 'said', 'watching', 'Herc', 'Xena', 'DVDs', 'decided', 'wanted', 'more', 'decided', 'give', 'Beastmaster', 'try', 'DVD', 'can', 'say', 'happily', 'was', 'NOT', 'mistake', 'series', 'great', 'when', 'seen', 'beginning', 'guess', 'problem', 'was', 'just', 'seeing', 'few', 'scenes', 'Season', '3', 'series', 'great', 'are', 'season-long', 'story', 'arcs', 'numerous', 're-occuring', 'characters', 'really', 'contribute', 'great', 'continuity', 'episodes', 'Now', ""n't"", 'continuity', 'would', 'find', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Farscape', 'continuity', 'more', 'way', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'continuity', 'Events', 'character', 'development', 'mostly', 're-occuring', 'characters', 'would', 'occur', 'previous', 'episodes', 'would', 'be', 'relevant', 'future', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Xena', 'Herc', 'fact', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'DS9.For', 'example', 'Season', '1', 'here', 'basically', 'one', 'story', 'arc', 'dealing', 'Dar', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'Kyra', 'who', 'been', 'imprisoned', 'King', 'Zad', 'Terrons', 'course', 'leads', 'Dar', 'quest', 'free', 'course', 'filler', 'episodes', 'even', 'still', 'contribute', 'someway', 'over-all', 'arc.The', 'acting', 'better', 'average', 'ordinary', 'TV', 'show', 'genre', 'Steven', 'Grives', 'who', 'King', 'Zad', 'excellently', 'cast', 'One', 'better', 'TV', 'villains', 'quite', 'while', 'excellent', 'casting', 'guest', 'stars', 'also', 'plus', 'series.A', 'note', 'Herc', 'Xena', 'fans', 'series', 'actually', 'more', 'serious', 'two', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'graphic', 'realistic', 'looking', 'occasional', 'wire-fu', 'moves', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'here', 'use', 'animals', 'other', 'guest', 'stars', 'times', 'do', 'get', 'emotional', 'even', 'teared', 'up', 'time', 'two.Special', 'effects', 'are', 'decent', 'CGI', 'use', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'compared', 'goofy', 'shots', 'Xena', 'Herc.These', 'DVD', 'come', '6-disc', 'amarray', 'cases', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'actually', 'guess', ""'re"", 'better', 'multi-disc', 'digipacks', 'Technical', 'specs', 'are', '1.78:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'very', 'nice', 'Image', 'quality', 'top', 'notch', 'occasional', 'grainy', 'dark', 'shot', 'Sound', 'however', 'just', 'DD', '2.0', 'shame', 'series', 'would', 'benefit', 'greatly', '5.1', 'track', 'even', '2.0', 'track', 'quite', 'adequate', 'ambient', 'sounds', 'coming', 'rear', 'channels.So', 'summary', 'like', 'Xena', 'Herc', 'want', 'more', 'same', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'dive', 'Beastmaster', 'shop', 'best', 'price']",N/A

765605,AM49AUZZNT3AS,B0000APVF8,Tyr Anasazi,"[12, 13]","I thought the show was too simple when it first premiered, but later I realized that its simplicity is its greatest strength. You have a guy with a bone staff (the beastmaster) who communicates with animals and a guy with a jade ring (Tao) who seeks knowledge. They live in some ""sanctuary"" under some tree where civilization is sparse and often venture out to explore the wonders of the ancient world on their own terms unrestricted by all the unnecessary complexity forced upon us today by our societies.They are also fond of being a pain in the neck to a certain King Zed, a fascinating villain who takes great pleasure in his life while doing absolutely anything in his power to preserve his rule. He is evil, motivated only by power, but intelligent, and even fascinates a certain Sorceress who is a student of a certain Ancient who supposedly knows the secrets of the universe but keeps them away from his student.Anyway, season one is the best, so get it now.

765606,A1DORQXHAAR8J9,B0000APVF8,"William H. Kelsey ""seeker of truth""","[1, 8]","Being too young to had seen the original ""BeastMaster"" starring the dude from ""V"" I can't compare the two (nor should the original series really matter in a review of this one), but if it was 1/10th as horrible as the latest ""BeastMaster"" they should had let it rest in peace. Why do I hate this series so much? For one thing, I can't stand all the cheesy pseudo-historical messes that came out around this time (Hercules, Xena, and this). The acting in all was awful, the actors were by and large hired for their looks, and the writers must had been as well since they obviously had neither talent nor imagination. The lead actor, whom so many women seem to think is just so hunky, looks way to skinny (I can actually count all of his ribs which is something that is not attractive in either gender). The storylines are beyond bad and the actors look as if they themselves want to tune to another channel as they deliver their sorry lines. It's just a very stupid show. The only reason why I gave it two instead of one star is because of the Asian sidekick (whose name escape me). He showed actual talent and charm (certainly way more than the Barbie boy lead whose acting skills are consist of basically standing around trying to make his cheekbones more pronounced) and as someone with an Asian son it's always great to see another Asian actor on the screen. If you're thinking about buying this, check it out on  the Sci-Fi channel sometime and see if you can watch it without muting it. If so, then mazel tov and purchase, but if you're like me and want some actual acting and quality storylines and plot then you will have to skip this one.",2,Absolutely the Worst Fantasy Series Ever,1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,1646,"['Being', 'too', 'young', 'had', 'seen', 'original', 'BeastMaster', 'starring', 'dude', 'V', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'should', 'original', 'series', 'really', 'matter', 'review', 'one', 'was', '1/10th', 'as', 'horrible', 'latest', 'BeastMaster', 'should', 'had', 'let', 'rest', 'peace', 'Why', 'do', 'hate', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'cheesy', 'pseudo-historical', 'messes', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'Hercules', 'Xena', 'acting', 'was', 'awful', 'actors', 'were', 'large', 'hired', 'looks', 'writers', 'must', 'had', 'been', 'as', 'well', 'obviously', 'had', 'talent', 'imagination', 'lead', 'actor', 'whom', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'seem', 'think', 'just', 'so', 'hunky', 'way', 'skinny', 'can', 'actually', 'count', 'ribs', 'something', 'not', 'attractive', 'gender', 'storylines', 'are', 'bad', 'actors', 'look', 'want', 'tune', 'channel', 'deliver', 'sorry', 'lines', 'just', 'very', 'stupid', 'show', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'gave', 'two', 'instead', 'one', 'star', 'Asian', 'sidekick', 'name', 'showed', 'actual', 'talent', 'charm', 'certainly', 'way', 'more', 'Barbie', 'boy', 'lead', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'consist', 'basically', 'standing', 'around', 'trying', 'make', 'cheekbones', 'more', 'pronounced', 'someone', 'Asian', 'son', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'Asian', 'actor', 'screen', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'buying', 'check', 'out', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'sometime', 'see', 'can', 'watch', 'muting', 'so', 'then', 'mazel', 'tov', 'purchase', ""'re"", 'want', 'actual', 'acting', 'quality', 'storylines', 'plot', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'skip', 'one']",N/A
