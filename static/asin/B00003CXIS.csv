526501,AWEOR1WZSMBEZ,B00003CXIS,,"[1, 8]","I see Fraser as a good actor with lots of potential for stardom but he is being typecasted in dumb roles lately (except for the Mummy series)-- this film being one of them.  Though there were some funny scenes, I did not find the entire film hilarious.  There were other &quot;stars&quot; in the cast but they were not given more exposure.  The film was primarily carried by Fraser, who though great with his goofy antics, was simultaneously tiresome being typecasted in such roles. If there ever was one thing I would remember it for for a long long time, it would be the annoying monkey character that Stu has made.  If they meant that creature to represent the dark side of our ever lovable protagonist &quot;Stu&quot;, then at least, they were successful in irritating the viewers.",3,Can't Fraser get better roles?,1012176000,"01 28, 2002",2002,785,"['see', 'Fraser', 'good', 'actor', 'lots', 'potential', 'stardom', 'being', 'typecasted', 'dumb', 'roles', 'lately', 'Mummy', 'series', 'film', 'being', 'one', 'were', 'funny', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'entire', 'film', 'hilarious', 'were', 'other', 'quot', 'stars', 'quot', 'cast', 'were', 'not', 'given', 'more', 'exposure', 'film', 'was', 'primarily', 'carried', 'Fraser', 'who', 'great', 'goofy', 'antics', 'was', 'simultaneously', 'tiresome', 'being', 'typecasted', 'such', 'roles', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'remember', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'annoying', 'monkey', 'character', 'Stu', 'made', 'meant', 'creature', 'represent', 'dark', 'side', 'ever', 'lovable', 'protagonist', 'quot', 'Stu', 'quot', 'then', 'least', 'were', 'successful', 'irritating', 'viewers']",Monkeybone

It is the kind of movie anyone who has seen it will never forget. SO I bet your just green with delight asking, What kind of movie be this? What could this movie possibly be about? Well. Meet Stan Miley a cartoon creator and Monkeybone the fruit of Stanleys imagination. The movie begins with Stan going to a party celebrating his comic strips sindication into a weekly television show. But, he leaves the party with his girlfriend, (Bridget Fonda, who met Stanley when he went to an institute to study a sleeping disorder he had). While he is leaving the parking lot he has a mishap with one of the Monkeybone toys being produced along with the sindication. Soon we find Stanley falling into a coma towards a strange city of nightmares where he stays while there. Here is when he comes upon Monkeybone in a seemingly living form who constantly jokes, harasses and generally tries to make it difficult for Stanley's pride to survive in Monkeybone's presence. That's all I'll let you in on but it should set the stage for a great movie. Would I let kids watch it? Not till they were at least 12. Whoopie Goldberg and Kris Kattan make cameo's in it both pretty good. So I would give it the 5 stars it deserves.

526508,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B00003CXIS,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[1, 2]","Monkeybone is a hard movie to review, as it's not necessarily a good movie, but it most definitely isn't bad in the least.  Yes, the movie's plot is paper-thin, character development is non-present, and the title character isn't seen enough.  However, the production design is amazing.The world of Downtown (supposedly the strange land of dreams where people go when they are in a coma) is a sight to behold, especially on DVD.  The first 40 minutes of the film are concentrated in this wonderful eye-candy filled mix of puppets, computer animation, and stop-motion animation.Unfortunately, once we leave this world in the middle portion of the movie, things go downhill and the script begins relying on really bad toilet humor and physical comedy way too heavily.  Yes, Brendan Fraser gives it his best shot, but it can't help from feeling a bit, well, stupid.In the last half hour, however, Chris Kattan's character FINALLY shows up, breathing new life into the movie and luckily it ends on a high note.At the low price this DVD is being offered for, it is worth getting even with it's negative points, if only for the first half of the movie.  The special features on the disc are wonderful and include some deleted scenes, which in my opinion, should have been left in the movie.  I recommend this movie with some reservations: keep an open mind and stick with it through the middle portion.

526509,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00003CXIS,Caleb Williams,"[3, 3]","By weird I do truly mean weird, in a way that you can't possibly see what was going through writer, Sam Hamms mind when devising this film. The story itself is weird enough but when focusing on the land of nightmares, known as Downtown, I found myself looking at something resembling the world of Jim Henson creations.The story focuses around artist and animator Stu Miley (Brendan Fraser), a man who struggles with nightmare problems and has just achieved success with his greatest cartoon creation, Monkeybone. One day after a preview showing of a pilot episode, Stu and his girlfriend Julie (Bridget Fonda) are involved in a car accident that lands Stu in a coma.Stu wakes up on a roller coaster that takes him downtown to the land of nightmares, where he meets creatures like you have never seen before. Along with the insane looking creatures, Stu comes face to face with his own creation Monkeybone who, after finding out Stu's sister decides to help Stu get an exit pass out of his coma. In order to get this pass he must steal it from under the nose of Death (Whoopi Goldberg). All doesn't go to plan and Stu is betrayed by Monkeybone and instead of Stu going back, Monkeybone takes his place in Stu's body in a deal with the dream god Hypnos (Giancarlo Esposito) to give more people nightmares. Now Stu is in a race to get out of dream world to save Julie and stop Monkeybone from giving people the nightmares that entertain downtown.If you thought the story was bizarre then I have to say that it really is, at times I found myself just thinking that this movie must have been created by some form of crazy person. With that aside we are still given a very good comedy movie with some very great slapstick moments that personally had me roaring with laughter.One of the funniest parts of the movie is when Monkeybone has taken over Stu's body and is in the bedroom with Julie about to make love. The classic mating dance is something to be experience and genuinely had me in tears. Sure, Brendan Fraser isn't known as the greatest actor in the world, but he's great in roles that just require a silly actor willing to do anything that will give the audience a laugh and that's what Fraser does.A very enjoyable movie that isn't for everyone, but if you're a fan of Fraser's ridiculous comedy work then this is surely for you.",5,The Weirdest Movie You'll Ever See,1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,2335,"['weird', 'do', 'truly', 'mean', 'weird', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'writer', 'Sam', 'Hamms', 'mind', 'when', 'devising', 'film', 'story', 'weird', 'enough', 'when', 'focusing', 'land', 'nightmares', 'known', 'Downtown', 'found', 'looking', 'something', 'resembling', 'world', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'creations.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'artist', 'animator', 'Stu', 'Miley', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'man', 'who', 'nightmare', 'problems', 'just', 'achieved', 'success', 'greatest', 'cartoon', 'creation', 'Monkeybone', 'One', 'day', 'preview', 'showing', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Stu', 'girlfriend', 'Julie', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'are', 'involved', 'car', 'accident', 'Stu', 'coma.Stu', 'up', 'roller', 'coaster', 'downtown', 'land', 'nightmares', 'where', 'creatures', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'insane', 'looking', 'creatures', 'Stu', 'face', 'face', 'own', 'creation', 'Monkeybone', 'who', 'finding', 'out', 'Stu', 'sister', 'help', 'Stu', 'get', 'exit', 'pass', 'coma', 'order', 'get', 'pass', 'must', 'steal', 'nose', 'Death', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', ""n't"", 'go', 'plan', 'Stu', 'betrayed', 'Monkeybone', 'instead', 'Stu', 'going', 'back', 'Monkeybone', 'place', 'Stu', 'body', 'deal', 'dream', 'god', 'Hypnos', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'give', 'more', 'people', 'nightmares', 'Now', 'Stu', 'race', 'get', 'dream', 'world', 'save', 'Julie', 'stop', 'Monkeybone', 'giving', 'people', 'nightmares', 'entertain', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'bizarre', 'then', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'times', 'found', 'just', 'thinking', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'form', 'crazy', 'person', 'aside', 'are', 'still', 'given', 'very', 'good', 'comedy', 'movie', 'very', 'great', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'personally', 'had', 'roaring', 'laughter.One', 'funniest', 'parts', 'movie', 'when', 'Monkeybone', 'taken', 'over', 'Stu', 'body', 'bedroom', 'Julie', 'make', 'love', 'classic', 'mating', 'dance', 'something', 'be', 'experience', 'genuinely', 'had', 'tears', 'Sure', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', ""n't"", 'known', 'greatest', 'actor', 'world', 'great', 'roles', 'just', 'require', 'silly', 'actor', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'will', 'give', 'audience', 'laugh', 'what', 'Fraser', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', ""n't"", 'everyone', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Fraser', 'ridiculous', 'comedy', 'work', 'then', 'surely']",Monkeybone
526510,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00003CXIS,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[9, 11]","It is amazing to me that every time Brendan Fraser does an edgy, risky movie, like this one, his audience bottoms out.  Yet when he does work that I find barely watchable, like the two &quot;Mummy&quot; movies, he is a huge hit.  This film drew few viewers, just like his &quot;Still Breathing,&quot; &quot;Gods and Monsters,&quot; and &quot;Twilight of the Golds.&quot;  Here Fraser plays cartoonist Stu who via a coma is transported to Down Town.  Other people in comas and people who are created by others' imaginations live in Down Town.  They all crave nightmares and dreams. It is a hyper surreal place. Stu's creation, Monkeybone, lives there too and Monkeybone plots to take Stu's place in the real world. Monkeybone does emerge in the real world in Stu's body and Fraser does a superb job playing a monkey in the body of a man. In fact, his character is the most fun when Monkeybone takes over.  I've never seen before &quot;Saturday Night Live's&quot; Chris Kattan. He plays a gymnast with a broken neck whose body Stu inhabits while trying to get his own body back from Monkeybone.  He turns in an amazing performance as well and I'd like to see him in more. I do not know the technicalities of animation film making.  However, the combination of animation characters with real world actors, like Fraser, is done superbly and seamlessly here.

526512,A2G4G46FUBY3VN,B00003CXIS,Cortez,"[4, 11]","Be thou not fooled by those that would compare Monkeybone to The Nightmare Before Christmas. If anything, Moneybone is a cousin to Ralph Bakshi's mess, Cool World. The plot: Underground cartoonist Stu Miley (Brendan Fraser) has long been the gloomy sort. Two events have made him a lot better than he used to be, though. Long plagued with nightmares, Stu went for help at a Los Angeles sleep institute where he met the love of his life, Dr. Julie McElroy (Bridget Fonda). With her guidance the artist began to channel everything repressed in his subconscious through a new comic strip character, Monkeybone. It's become such a hit that as the story begins, Stu's simian id is about to become animated as the Comedy Channel&#8217;s hot new cult TV show.This lucky role sadly lasts only as long it takes for Stu and Julie to try to drive away from his first big promotional shindig as a freak accident leaves Stu in a coma. His big surprise comes next as he finds himself traveling from the earth to a surreal village floating in a void partially inhabited by people in a similar physical state. Ruled by the Dream God Hypnos (Giancarlo Esposito), the majority of the residents turn out to be monsters and creatures from the dreams of the human race. Most annoyingly, one of the locals turns out to be Monkeybone (voice of John Turturro). Now about three months later Stu realizes that he has a much bigger problem. He'd made a pact with his sister Kimmy (Megan Mullally) that if one of them was stuck in a coma, the other wouldn't waste time pulling the plug. With little time left, he finds only one option. To return to the world of the living, Stu will have to steal a treasured golden exit pass from Hypnos' sister Death (Whoopi Goldberg). Monkeybone offers to help his creator, but his motives might not be in Stu's best interest. Before he comes around to what's really happening, he finds himself in much deeper trouble, MONKEY TROUBLE. Now he has to find a way back to the waking world fast before Monkeybone can destroy it.The lowdown: Henry Selick was a somewhat obscure but rising animator before Tim Burton and producer Denise Di Novi brought him up to the next level to direct The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. Monkeybone is Selick's first feature without his mentors, and it's a mess. Attempting to pinpoint exactly where this flick goes awry is a tricky thing to do. Between the cold fish delivery of the sophomoric dialogue and the insanely infantile ... humor, it's really a toss-up. Surviving the first half of this 82-minute nightmare is easy compared to the second half, as the wildly desperate ""plot twists"" kick in and Stephen King turns up for his ridiculous cameo to make a tired Cujo joke. There's a wealth of underdone characters here, from Stu's barely glossed-over background to his cut-and-paste sister Clarissa, and from Goldberg's barely tolerable Death to Foley's annoying Yes Man Herb. Hamm's script feels hastily written, or, more likely, hastily rewritten. The few gags that work -- once in Stu's body, Monkeybone appears wearing a Lloyd Llewellyn T-shirt, a nod to Daniel Clowes' existentialist cult comic book -- are castaways in a sea of stupidity. The tone and pacing are all over the place. I wonder if Selick and his producers were waffling between going for a dark edgy tone and a manic comedy, because the movie teeters between the two, even within a single scene. It's so choppy that you might think there were bits removed all over the place.I think the worst thing about this flick, is that it could have been great.

And yet miraculously, this is the better film.""Monkeybone"" can give most children nightmares, pretty much what""Cool World""did for me.  But unlike Ralph Bakshi's unmerited trash, I sorta enjoyed this movie as well as admit to its disturbing atmosphere.  Director Henry Selick has always been the go-to guy for scary designs based on acouple offilmshe made, which is why he's Tim Burton's no.2 on his buddy list.  His stop-motion works always appear so grim and yet so fascinating, filled with creative nuances in how the set pieces move.  Therefore, I really like the visual treatment this live-action/stop-motion combo is going for.It's about a cartoonist named Stu (Brendon Fraser) who successfully pitched a cartoon series based on his creation, Monkeybone.  He was about to pitch to his scientific girlfriend (Bridget Fonda), until he somehow got into a coma from an inflatable animal-related car accident.  His soul went into a purgatory-like place, Downtown.  It's a vulgar, perverse surreal world he's in, and many frightening stop-motion animations cross his path; on the upside, it had Rose McGowan as cleavage-tastic catgirl.  He meets his cancerous, unlikable imaginary simian, Monkeybone, and the two tried to escape from this world, but it was trick by Monkeybone who instead stole his body.  Stu has to rely on the unlike force of Whoopi Goldberg as Death to get his body back and to stop a sinster plot to produce more nightmares from the living, because his girlfriend happened to make chemical compound called 'nightmare fuel' (which acts more like the toxin The Scarecrow used).As interesting as the story is, it's not much to rave about.  The director seems to be weak in the real world scenes, because they're not as fun as Downtown and the Monkeybone-possessed Stu's antics are more primal than clever. If there's one scene in the real world that I enjoyed, it's the part where Stu possessed a dead gymnast (Chris Kattan) and is being chased by doctors wanting his organs, probably because Bob Odenkirk was one of the doctors; normally, I would get annoyed wondering why the doctors are chasing a corpse without wondering why it's even alive, but since Bob and Chris delivered a good set of laughs, I let it slide. ""Monkeybone"" was fun by its artistic merits, because it sure isn't for Brendan's dull attempt at playing two characters, the title character's wisecracks, and people simply monkeying around.",3,"Crass monkey, that freakin' monkey",1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,2531,"['Well', 'Country', 'Bears', 'review', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'come', 'monkey', 'movie', 'yet', 'miraculously', 'better', 'film', 'Monkeybone', 'can', 'give', 'most', 'children', 'nightmares', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'Cool', 'World', 'did', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'unmerited', 'trash', 'sorta', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'admit', 'disturbing', 'atmosphere', 'Director', 'Henry', 'Selick', 'always', 'been', 'go-to', 'guy', 'scary', 'designs', 'based', 'acouple', 'offilmshe', 'made', 'why', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'no.2', 'buddy', 'list', 'stop-motion', 'works', 'always', 'appear', 'so', 'grim', 'yet', 'so', 'fascinating', 'filled', 'creative', 'nuances', 'how', 'set', 'pieces', 'move', 'Therefore', 'really', 'visual', 'treatment', 'live-action/stop-motion', 'combo', 'going', 'for.It', 'cartoonist', 'named', 'Stu', 'Brendon', 'Fraser', 'who', 'successfully', 'pitched', 'cartoon', 'series', 'based', 'creation', 'Monkeybone', 'was', 'about', 'pitch', 'scientific', 'girlfriend', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'somehow', 'got', 'coma', 'inflatable', 'animal-related', 'car', 'accident', 'soul', 'went', 'purgatory-like', 'place', 'Downtown', 'vulgar', 'perverse', 'surreal', 'world', 'many', 'frightening', 'stop-motion', 'animations', 'cross', 'path', 'upside', 'had', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'cleavage-tastic', 'catgirl', 'cancerous', 'unlikable', 'imaginary', 'simian', 'Monkeybone', 'two', 'tried', 'escape', 'world', 'was', 'trick', 'Monkeybone', 'who', 'instead', 'stole', 'body', 'Stu', 'rely', 'force', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Death', 'get', 'body', 'back', 'stop', 'sinster', 'plot', 'produce', 'more', 'nightmares', 'living', 'girlfriend', 'happened', 'make', 'chemical', 'compound', 'called', ""'nightmare"", 'fuel', 'more', 'toxin', 'Scarecrow', 'used', '.As', 'interesting', 'story', 'not', 'much', 'rave', 'about', 'director', 'be', 'weak', 'real', 'world', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'not', 'as', 'fun', 'Downtown', 'Monkeybone-possessed', 'Stu', 'antics', 'are', 'more', 'primal', 'clever', 'one', 'scene', 'real', 'world', 'enjoyed', 'part', 'where', 'Stu', 'possessed', 'dead', 'gymnast', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'being', 'chased', 'doctors', 'wanting', 'organs', 'probably', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'was', 'one', 'doctors', 'normally', 'would', 'get', 'annoyed', 'wondering', 'why', 'doctors', 'are', 'chasing', 'corpse', 'wondering', 'why', 'even', 'alive', 'Bob', 'Chris', 'delivered', 'good', 'set', 'laughs', 'let', 'slide', 'Monkeybone', 'was', 'fun', 'artistic', 'merits', 'sure', ""n't"", 'Brendan', 'dull', 'attempt', 'playing', 'two', 'characters', 'title', 'character', 'wisecracks', 'people', 'simply', 'monkeying', 'around']",Monkeybone

526523,A146D2LYLICNLS,B00003CXIS,eric_f,"[3, 3]","""Monkeybone"" is one of those movies that come and go without much attention and pretty much slip into obscurity shortly after they're released, even if they contain a well-known cast. The subject matter is what kills any chance of making big bucks at the box office or becoming a movie that everyone will have heard of afterwards. Still, ""Monkeybone"" is a hidden treat for any fan of the twisted, brainless and silly comedy.This movie reminds me a lot of Adam Sandler's ""Little Nicky,"" and I think others who have seen both films would agree. But ""Monkeybone"" is much less crude and vulgar, and instead of CGI uses stop-motion special effects, which are quite good. The animation for the character of Monkeybone is definitely one of the high points of this movie, and give it a unique flavor.I consider myself only a casual fan of Brendan Fraser, so IMO this movie would have worked just as well with any other actor capable of taking on this type of role. Not to knock Fraser though...his performance is certainly good.

526527,A19JYLHD94K94D,B00003CXIS,Itamar Katz,"[2, 2]","Monkeybone is without doubt one of the most underrated and badly-marketed films of recent years. The DVD cover was very misleading, and made it look like a tasteless B-comedy; the names of Brendan Fraser, Bridget Fonda and Chris Kattan didn't do much good either. I never would have dreamed of picking it up in the video store if it wasn't for the director, his name hardly even noticeable on the back cover.Henry Selick is the man responsible for two of the most remarkable animation features of the 90s - James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas (Tim Burton's vision, sure, but ultimately Selick's film). Both were sardonic, immensely stylish animated films and had some of the most wonderfully designed cartoon characters I've ever seen. Watching Monkeybone proves beyond doubt that even though Burton was the main brain behind The Nightmare Before Christmas, as far as design and character creation goes, most of the credit for the brilliant animation work should go to Mr. Selick. On Monkeybone Selick decided to make his first attempt at directing live actors, and does less than well. Aside from having a not very impressive lead actor in Brendan Fraser, most of the live action part of the film is - despite some moments of inspiration - not much more then slapstick and low-brow comedy. Sure, you may get a couple of cheap laughs out of Chris Kattan and Dave Foley, maybe even from Fraser (one of my least favorite actors, actually), but that section of the film is nothing to write home about.However... about half the film takes place in a fantasy world called Downtown, a place where the comatose souls live, waiting to die or to awaken into the real world. Not only is that world designed in the most wonderful sardonic humor of Henry Selick's previous exploits, it's horded with one of the most wonderful casts of animated monsters I've ever seen - one that would make Jim Henson proud. Selick does not once give in to computer generated animation; all of the characters are entirely mechanical. Real life animated figures have a feel to them that computerized characters could never have - the kind of feel the characters on Nightmare have or in Henson classics like Dark Crystal and Storyteller. Each of the monster characters in Monkeybone is an intricately designed, finely crafted living creature with immense personality. The fascinating extras on the DVD include a wonderful gallery of sketches for each of those characters, as well as an inside look on how they were created - there are some original and brilliant technical solutions for some of the characters. John Torturro supplies Monkeybone's hilarious voice in a performance that reminds me slightly of his memorable appearance in Miller's Crossing, and Whoopi Goldberg grants a lovely cameo.If you're reading this, you're one of two - either you're a Brendan Fraser or Chris Kattan fan, in which case you're likely to enjoy the slapstick humor of the real world section of the film, or you've heard about the film or about Henry Selick and are into it for the animation and design. From the point of view of an animator or anyone who is interested in the more classic side of animation, Monkeybone is a fascinating watch. Don't expect it to be another Nightmare Before Christmas, but try to ignore some of the dumb jokes and cheesy humor, and really get a load of the incredible work done on it. They just don't make animation like this anymore.By the way: The Amazon.com editorial review said Fraser plays 'the best-looking cartoonist you'll ever see'. Wrong! You forgot one important precedent - Brad Pitt in Cool World. And the similarities between the two movies don't stop there.

My impression at the time was that it was a wierd and stupid movie with no point. I recently found it for $5 so I decided to give it a try, and I am glad I did. Everyone I know hates this movies or has not seen it, but I now think this is a wonderful movie.Stu Miley (Brendan Frasier) has just launched his new animated character Monkeybone, created from Stu's repressed sexual anxieties(as another reviewer put it). Monkeybone is a hot character that brings a huge demand for cartoons, toys, and just about any other kind of merchandising you can think of. After a party for the launch of his new character, Stu and his girlfriend are in a car wreck leaving Stu in a coma. This happens just when Stu is going to propose to his girlfriend. As others see him in a coma, Stu ends up in Downtown, the place where other people in a coma reside, along with their nightmares. I really enjoyed the effects that take place in Downtown. But once there, Stu comes face to face with his creation, and together must find a way out of Downtown before Stu's sister ""pulls the plug"" on him in the outside world. Monkeybone turns on Stu and steals his pass into the real world, and so with a deal from Death (Whoopi Goldberg) Stu must get back to his life and stop Monkeybone from ruining his life. Thats all I want to say about the plot, and it may sound dumb or a little complicated, but to me is a good and very entertaining movie. Bottom line is that this is a nice blend of live-action and animation and is nicely directed by Henry Selick. And as usual Frasier gives a nice performance in this starring role. At the heart of this movie is also a good love story. A lot of you may not like this movie, but at least watch it once and give it a chance.

Chiappelli ""jjcx""","[3, 3]","If only I had the power to film some additional footage and then re-release this, I think ""Monkeybone"" would be a much bigger hit, and people would love it a lot more. Sadly, I'm just some punk kid from Maryland, so that's not possible. Yet. The story is very fun, very weird, and more original than most junk that has been released in the past couple of years. Everybody else has already wrote about it, and you can read about the story in the description, so I won't bother. All of the actors fit their roles pretty well, and there isn't anybody who is really irritating. The special effects are great and incredibly atmospheric. I almost want to see a TV series about Downtown, just because it's such an amazing thing to see. The dialogue is usually well-fitting, and there are some really great jokes, as well as some really horrible ones, but there's a very decent balance. So, why give this only 3 stars? Because the beginning was rushed way too much. To begin with, they open it with a cartoon that is meant to be a mood-setter, to show you what the Monkeybone character is like and what the comedy style is like. The cartoon fails miserably. It's not funny at all, and it's just embarrassing to watch. After the cartoon, there are a few attempts to develop Stu, the main character, and his girlfriend. Then they just skip the plot/character development entirely, and send Stu to Downtown. This would be great if they bothered to explain Downtown first, but they didn't, and you sort of have to guess based on what the description of the movie is and a short song that some talking lampposts sing. With maybe twenty minutes of additional footage at the beginning to ease us into the story, this movie would have been gold. I've been told that the deleted scenes/extended scenes on the DVD help the beginning, but I haven't seen them yet, so I can't tell. It's a good movie, but don't give up after the first bit. Stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with a wonderful story about the dream world, and one of the best movie climaxes in history (It reminds me of the Stay-Puft marshmallow man from ""Ghostbusters"").",3,I really want to re-make this movie,998611200,"08 24, 2001",2001,2119,"['only', 'had', 'power', 'film', 'additional', 'footage', 'then', 're-release', 'think', 'Monkeybone', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'bigger', 'hit', 'people', 'would', 'love', 'lot', 'more', 'Sadly', ""'m"", 'just', 'punk', 'kid', 'Maryland', 'not', 'possible', 'story', 'very', 'fun', 'very', 'weird', 'more', 'original', 'most', 'junk', 'been', 'released', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'Everybody', 'else', 'already', 'wrote', 'can', 'read', 'story', 'description', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'actors', 'fit', 'roles', 'pretty', 'well', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'who', 'really', 'irritating', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'incredibly', 'atmospheric', 'almost', 'want', 'see', 'TV', 'series', 'Downtown', 'just', 'such', 'amazing', 'thing', 'see', 'dialogue', 'usually', 'well-fitting', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'jokes', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'horrible', 'ones', 'very', 'decent', 'balance', 'So', 'why', 'give', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'beginning', 'was', 'rushed', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'begin', 'open', 'cartoon', 'meant', 'be', 'mood-setter', 'show', 'what', 'Monkeybone', 'character', 'what', 'comedy', 'style', 'cartoon', 'miserably', 'not', 'funny', 'just', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'cartoon', 'are', 'few', 'attempts', 'develop', 'Stu', 'main', 'character', 'girlfriend', 'Then', 'just', 'skip', 'plot/character', 'development', 'entirely', 'send', 'Stu', 'Downtown', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'bothered', 'explain', 'Downtown', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'sort', 'have', 'guess', 'based', 'what', 'description', 'movie', 'short', 'song', 'talking', 'lampposts', 'sing', 'maybe', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'additional', 'footage', 'beginning', 'ease', 'story', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'gold', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'deleted', 'scenes/extended', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'help', 'beginning', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'first', 'bit', 'Stick', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'wonderful', 'story', 'dream', 'world', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'climaxes', 'history', 'Stay-Puft', 'marshmallow', 'man', 'Ghostbusters']",Monkeybone

My expectations were not too high - given Brendan Fraser as the lead - but I was happily surprised to see that Fraser can pull off not only the glum and reluctant hero but also the goofy and giddy clown type.Cartoonist Stu Miley is on the verge of financial success and he doesn't like it.  His dark and perverse brand of humor depends on there being obstacles to happiness in his life.  Of course he's about to propose to his gorgeous girlfriend and so something bad is bound to happen - an accident puts him into a coma and he finds himself in the bizarre world of his own nightmares with no escape but to steal an exit pass from death herself.  The problem is his sidekick monkey - a barely veiled phallic symbol that embodies his unconscious urges - would like to get out too and has different plans for his life than the happy ending he'd hoped for.It's a fun and silly ride - but I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't more frightening: after all this is Henry Selick's film.  The film has the feel of a slightly less focused and more silly version ofBeetlejuice, but it isn't quite as fun (maybe because Brendan Fraser lacks the madcap talent of Michael Keaton and because his girlfriend Bridget Fonda lacks the charisma and good humor of Geena Davis), and it isn't very scary, just dementedly goofy.  I mean that in a good way, and did enjoy the movie and recognize that it was a huge risk for Selick to expend his free directorial pass on a personal film that would almost surely be (and was) misunderstood by the studios and underappreciated by audiences.

While in a coma Stu (Fraser) is transported to a strange world, called ""Downtown"", which is full of both characters he created in his dreams and other people who are in comas (for some reason).  While in this strange land Stu meets the star of his comic strip, Monkeybone.  The mischievous (and more annoying than funny) Monkeybone tricks Stu into helping him steal his own body --the one that's in a coma in the real world.  Stu wants his body back and spends the rest of the film trying to do so while Monkeybone wreaks some havoc in the real world. That's all you really need to know about the story.""Monkeybone"" is the type of movie that I like to describe as ""eye candy"" -- the visual effects and scenery were interesting enough to keep me satisfied.  Unfortunately the film was lopsided, heavy on the effects (which were great, reason enough to justify seeing the movie) but light on the dialogue.  The writers had some good ideas but not enough for an entire feature-length film...well, actually....if the film had been a little longer maybe some of the plot twists would have been better explained, and would have cleared a lot of things up.Overall, the story was imaginative and interesting but at points confusing and contrived....especially the part about the distribution of the ""Nightmare Juice"" -- a concoction used to give humans nightmares and provides the people who live ""Downtown"" with some entertainment.  Why? I dunno....I guess people in comas and the figments of Stu's imagination have nothing better to do than watch other people's nightmares.  Right, whatever.The acting was good.  Brendan Fraser was cast perfectly....the goofy, sexy, sweet guy (big surprise).  Chris Kattan was also hilarious.  Kattan's character was only in the film for the last 10 minutes which is unfortunate because he was the funniest character.  What else can I say?  The film was interesting, visually stimulating, but not very funny.  In fact, I thought it was a little raunchy for it's PG-13 rating-- most of the jokes are sexual.  Too bad, it was a cute story.Recommendation:  The idea was there but the script was poor and most of the jokes weren't very funny.

Krug,"[1, 1]","Assuming you've read amazon's plot description, the film continues into the second act when Monkeybone double-crosses Stu and steals the golden ticket, and wakes up in Stu's body. Stu himself is still stuck in the purgatory known as Downtown. Mean while, in our world Monkeybone as Stu grows a gottee, acts like an animal in bed with his girlfriend Julie, and is distrusted by his dog. What's more, he shows a sudden intrest in marketing the Monkeybone franchise. (The real Stu never cared about making a huge profit off of his artistic creation.) Monkeybone meanwhile his visited by the devil (who also resides in Downtown,) in a dream while he's asleep, who tells Monkeybone he wants him to steal some experimental nightmare juice from the hospidal and put it into the Monkeybone dolls that are about to be sold. (They're the kind of dolls that you squeeze and they &quot;fart&quot; out a purple cloud.)Now, so far, so good. As far as we know, this could in fact be all in Stu's mind. I know this was probably never intended as an intillectual movie, but I still had a fun time thinking about this. But then we come to the third act and the movie falls completly apart. Stu makes a deal with Death to let him go back to our world and stop Monkeybone. I personally would have preferred to see Stu get sent back to his own body and wage mental war with Monkeybone for control over his body, thus still leaving us with the possibility that maybe it's all psycological. Instead, Stu is sent back into the body of a dead guy. This still could have been O.K. (even though it would have still meant the film was definetly supernatural,) if Stu had been sent into the body of a guy who's just died but who nobody knows is dead yet. Like, say, a jogger who's just had a heart attack. Instead, he's sent back into the body of an olympic athlete who's broken his neck and who's in the hospidal having his organs removed. Now, imagine just what kind of an upset it would be to the world if a dead body suddenly sprang to life and ran out of the hospidal. However, the film doesn't seem at all concerned with this, as it's played strictly for laughs. The doctors chase after him, yelling,&quot;We won't hurt you! We just want your organs!&quot; I sat there going,&quot;What happened?

""Monkeybone,"" directed by Henry Selick and written by Sam Hamm is-- well-- none of those things, which is unfortunate for everyone involved with the project, but mostly for the unsuspecting audience upon which it is sprung.The movie begins with a short ""Monkeybone"" cartoon, a pilot created from a popular comic strip written by Stu Miley (Brendan Fraser), which has just been picked up by Comedy Central and contracted for a number of episodes.  The cartoon depicts the origins of Monkeybone himself, and the appeal is purely infantile (and that's being kind).  After the premiere of this animated masterpiece, Stu attends the promo party with his girlfriend, Dr. Julie McElroy (Bridget Fonda), who is indirectly responsible for the existence of Monkeybone in the first place.  Stu had suffered from a sleep disorder due to nightmares since he could remember, and it was Dr. Julie who turned his life around, treating him at the sleep clinic into which he checked himself when he finally couldn't take it anymore.  At that point in his life, Stu's cartoons ranged from the gruesome to the downright disturbed-- all extensions of his nightmares; then Julie suggested drawing with his left hand instead of his right, and the result was the emergence of Monkeybone, who apparently is supposed to be the flip side of his nightmares.  Which may be true for Stu, but not necessarily for the audience.Monkeybone himself (with voice provided by John Turturro sounding like he's been inhaling helium), is-- far from being funny, cute or endearing in any way, shape or form-- an annoying little spud who grates on the senses from the moment he appears on screen, which beyond the opening cartoon, begins with Stu's descent into ""Down Town,"" the land of nightmares residing within his own mind into which he slips when a freak accident puts him in a coma.  It's a freakish place, a kind of demented ""Toon Town,"" populated by (besides the ever-present and irritating Monkeybone) such illustrious  nightmare mongers as Edgar Allan Poe, Jack the Ripper, Lizzy Borden, Attila the Hun and Stephen King (yes, the real King, in a cameo appearance).  The crux of Stu's problem is that he has to get his hands on an ""Exit Pass,"" in order to defy Death (Whoopi Goldberg), and make his escape back into the land of the living.Brendan Fraser has to be given credit for not being afraid to take on challenging (some would say questionable) roles; from the comic antics of ""George of the Jungle,"" to the comedy/drama of ""With Honors,"" to the action-packed ""Mummy"" films that have been so successful.  Overall, he's made a career out of taking chances and ferreting out parts that have quite effectively showcased his versatility and talent as an actor.  And it's easy to understand why this vehicle would've appealed to him.  On paper, at least, it probably looked like it would work; and Stu, as written, probably seemed like a character that would give him another opportunity to spread his wings and show some range.  Unfortunately, it's a long, long journey from script to screen, as they say.  And even an Oscar worthy performance in this case (and it wasn't) couldn't have saved the day.  The best that can be said is that Fraser did as well as anyone could have with the material he was given.As for Bridget Fonda, one has to ask how an actor of her caliber gets caught up in such a thankless, generic role as this, which served the story as little more than fancy window dressing.  Fonda is simply too good and too deserving of better than to wind up in a part as forgettable as this.  But then again, it may have looked good on paper.  We'll call it that.The supporting cast includes Chris Kattan (Organ Donor Stu), Giancarlo Esposito (Hypnos), Rose McGowan (Kitty), Dave Foley (Herb), Megan Mullally (Kimmy) and Lisa Zane (Medusa).  Sometimes it's fun to just relax and watch a movie that doesn't require much effort or thought and just lets you roll with the flow, but ""Monkeybone"" isn't one of them.  This is the one that never should have made it past the first draft of the screenplay, and Fraser and Fonda should invest in some white-out to try and expunge this from their respective filmographies.  There's magic in the movies, but not when the wires are exposed and you can see the trap door in the stage.  So file this one under ""Sorry-- but try again,"" and we can all move on to bigger, better and happier times.",1,Monkeywhat?,995414400,"07 18, 2001",2001,5007,"['Fantasy', 'genre', 'pretty', 'much',

526550,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00003CXIS,Robert Moore,"[6, 7]","When this movie came out, it both garnered a huge number of really bad reviews and inspired very few people to come see it at the theater. The truth is that while it is by no means a great movie, it isn't at all a bad one, either. I might have found it disappointing in the theater, but at home on a DVD player, it provided a quite enjoyable couple of hours.There is, however, a lot of talent that isn't fully utilized in this film. Most of the weight of the film is placed on the shoulders of Brendan Frasier, and he does his usual excellent job (though I am concerned that, the Mummy series apart, he is starting to get stuck in doofus roles--he is better than that, as GODS AND MONSTERS showed, and I would love to see him in a wider variety of roles). But Bridget Fonda is not really called upon to do much, Whoopi Goldberg has what almost appears as a cameo role, David Foley is a one-dimensional character, and no one else is really called to do very much. The only other actors who really add much to the film are John Turturro voicing Monkeybone and Chris Kattan. I normally loathe Kattan, who is one of the main reasons I haven't been able to watch SNL for several years, but he does a creditable job as an animated corpse in a small but crucial role (the box cover extravagantly exaggerates the size of his role, and seeing him on the cover actually was one of the deterrents to my seeing the film for quite some time).But the real star of MONKEYBONE is everyone who was involved in the art and set design. Easily the most compelling parts of MONKEYBONE are those where Stu (Brendan Frasier) is stuck in the nightmare world. Harry Selick, the director, also directed both THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS and JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH, and there is a definite stylistic resemblance between the three films. MONKEYBONE is without question the lesser film of the three, but not at all unwatchable for all that.",3,"Much, much better than I was anticipating",1010016000,"01 3, 2002",2002,1916,"['When', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'garnered', 'huge', 'number', 'really', 'bad', 'reviews', 'inspired', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'come', 'see', 'theater', 'truth', 'great', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'found', 'disappointing', 'theater', 'home', 'DVD', 'player', 'provided', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'couple', 'hours.There', 'however', 'lot', 'talent', ""n't"", 'fully', 'utilized', 'film', 'Most', 'weight', 'film', 'placed', 'shoulders', 'Brendan', 'Frasier', 'usual', 'excellent', 'job', 'am', 'concerned', 'Mummy', 'series', 'apart', 'starting', 'get', 'stuck', 'doofus', 'roles', 'better', 'GODS', 'AND', 'MONSTERS', 'showed', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'wider', 'variety', 'roles', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'not', 'really', 'called', 'upon', 'do', 'much', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'what', 'almost', 'cameo', 'role', 'David', 'Foley', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'one', 'else', 'really', 'called', 'do', 'very', 'much', 'only', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'add', 'much', 'film', 'are', 'John', 'Turturro', 'voicing', 'Monkeybone', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'normally', 'loathe', 'Kattan', 'who', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'SNL', 'several', 'years', 'creditable', 'job', 'animated', 'corpse', 'small', 'crucial', 'role', 'box', 'cover', 'extravagantly', 'size', 'role', 'seeing', 'cover', 'actually', 'was', 'one', 'deterrents', 'seeing', 'film', 'quite', 'time', 'real', 'star', 'MONKEYBONE', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'art', 'set', 'design', 'Easily', 'most', 'compelling', 'parts', 'MONKEYBONE', 'are', 'where', 'Stu', 'Brendan', 'Frasier', 'stuck', 'nightmare', 'world', 'Harry', 'Selick', 'director', 'also', 'directed', 'THE', 'NIGHTMARE', 'BEFORE', 'CHRISTMAS', 'JAMES', 'AND', 'THE', 'GIANT', 'PEACH', 'definite', 'stylistic', 'resemblance', 'three', 'films', 'MONKEYBONE', 'question', 'lesser', 'film', 'three', 'not', 'unwatchable']",Monkeybone

526552,A1MN1Y3QNUFRBE,B00003CXIS,"Robert W. Berg ""Rob""","[31, 36]","&quot;Monkeybone&quot; is the type of experimental, twisted movie that is destined to become a cult classic.  Mixing shades of Tim Burton's &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; with an enormous variety of influences such as &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit,&quot; &quot;All of Me,&quot; &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; and even &quot;Regarding Henry,&quot; this movie is a stop-motion cartoon, a live-action love story, a dark comedy, a fantasy, a Freudian nightmare, and more. It contains an extremely diverse and unusual cast, including Brendan Fraser as a cartoonist in a coma, Bridget Fonda as his fiancee, Whoopi Goldberg as Death (yes, you read that right), Chris Kattan as the decomposing corpse of a gymnast, Megan Mullally as the cartoonist's sister who is very eager to pull the plug, Dave Foley as the cartoonist's manager, and Rose McGowan as a kitty cat (yes, once again, you read that right)!  It also contains bizzare, strange, and cool animation by director Henry Selick, who also directed Tim Burton's &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas.&quot;Ostensibly, &quot;Monkeybone&quot; is the story about an artist's struggle between artistic integrity and cartoonish commercialism, about the difference between a work of art and a mere doodle, a satire about the consequences of &quot;selling out.&quot;  It is also a Freudian fairy tale about a man whose sexual id is represented by a cartoon monkey.  Monkeybone is literally this man's erection.  The story is an examination of what happens when one lets one's id take over his whole life. It is a psychological analysis of what nightmares are made of.  It is a surrealistic comedy containing some of the most startling, visually stunning images you are likely to see on film for a long time, including strange representations of many classical, mythological creatures. It is a love story.  While this might sound like the premise of an independant film, this is actually a big budget film that was marketed to look like a children's movie. Not a good idea.It's no wonder this movie did so poorly at the box office. Believe it or not, this film is the type that should have been playing at small art houses, not mainstream movie theatres. Even the cover box says it's the crudest movie since &quot;South Park.&quot; In short, the studio didn't know how to market its own movie.This movie is an extremely likable one, hilariously funny at times, always seriously bizarre, and obviously the work of a demented genius. It is hard to deny the brilliant artistry involved, and the all-around great acting by the cast. In fact, I respect every actor in this film immensely, especially the big budget ones such as Whoopi Goldberg and Brendan Fraser. This is the type of weird movie they didn't have to do, but chose to do. It is a project they wanted to be involved in, and I respect them for that.Typically, most of the reviewers, mostly in the middle of the country, panned this film. However, many major newspapers and publications, such as &quot;The New York Times,&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it great reviews, despite its messy nature.And this is one of the few movies in recent history in which its mess actually adds to its likability. A more polished version of this film would be not be half as enjoyable, brilliant, crazy, or maddening as this truly original, insane piece of filmmaking. As it is now, the viewer constantly wonders what strange happening will occur next, and, trust me, it is always stranger than you thought it would be.I would not recommend this film to everyone. I would probably recommend it mostly to serious movie buffs or lovers of very original, non-mainstream film, who enjoy Tim Burton/Sam Raimiesque humor in their cinema.

Stu's new found success comes mostly at the hands of his new girlfriend Julie who helped him overcome terrible nightmares. Julie you see is a sleep therapist. Just when things are going great, there is a little car accident that throws Stu into a coma. In his coma, Stu is caught in the bizarre world of his nightmares where Monkeybone pulls a fast one and takes over Stu's body and life. Now Stu must make a daring escape before Monkeybone screws everything up.My Opinion: This is a goofy little ditty of a movie. It's like a long drawn out loony toons episode. You basically know what is going to happen before it happens. Monkeybone is kind of annoying and he gets old really fast f;ladka;lasd;kda . . . . whoa whoa whoa, what's going on here? How do I delete stuff? Forget that stuff about Monkeybone getting old. And there should be 5 stars in the rating, not 2. And the title should be &quot;Awesome Monkey in an Awesome Movie&quot;. I was not myself when I wrote that. This is the best movie that has ever been made with a Monkey in the leading role. It's intelligent and exciting and artistic. It would have been completely perfect had the Monkeybone been allowed to keep Stu's body. But hey that's what sequels are for right? And man did you see the can on Julie? You can see where the Bone in Monkeybone comes from no doubt.DVD Quality: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 DD5.1 Tons of extras featuring the wonderful Monkeybone who should have been in the movie more. They got the title right at least. Wait until the Oscars baby. The old Boner is gonna be there with bells on. And he'll be taking home the gold. Have no doubts about that.What You Should Do: You should bow down and worship the Bone; Mr. Bone, Bone-a-rama. And send him money by buying this DVD. Buy more than one. Give them to friends and strangers.Related Movies To Check Out: You don't need any other stinkin' movies besides this one.

526558,A11JU33HMT5XPU,B00003CXIS,"S. Lawrenz ""Lendorien""","[2, 3]","Synopsis:A freak car crash, (involving a giant inflatable monkey) sends cartoonist Stu Miley (Brenden Fraser) into coma and into a nightmarish and bizarre between world called Downtown where coma patients must wait for their ticket back.  There he meets an aspect of his twisted personality, a character he created called Monkeybone.As Stu waits in limbo, back in the real world where his girlfriend (Bridget Fonda) waits for him to recover, his sister, Kimmy plans to pull the plug. Monkeybone and Stu discover her plans and try to escape back to the real world.  But a double-cross nearly dooms Stu and his life altogether and sends Monkeybone on a crazy (and somewhat raunchy) escapade in the real world.About the movie:I found this movie somewhat painful to watch and was left wondering how anyone could think that something this bizarre and poorly written would do well in the theaters.  (It didn't do that well).As a movie, this one is pretty odd overall, and the script is below par at best.  There are quite a few spots that could use more exposition, and the main characters definitely needed to be fleshed out more.  None of them make you care a whit about what happens to them. Bridget Fonda is nice to look at, but she was totally luke-warm in her role as Stu's girlfriend (not that she had much to work with) and Brendan Fraser's character is so neurotic as to make you wonder why she'd even like him. Whoopi Goldberg has a cameo as Death, but her role is pretty much a yawner as well.This is not to mention that there are some pretty gross things in this movie.  Chris Kattan (who proves in this role that he is a fantastic physical comedian, something worth seeing, if only for his acting) running around as a reanimated dead guy with a broken neck was extremely entertaining, for his physical comedy, but the bit with the organs falling out onto people was in really bad taste and more than a little gross.The end result of all of this is that you have a weak movie that subsists mainly on bodily function jokes and sexual gags for almost all of its humor, and of that, most of it is of the extremely low brow and immature sort.  If you happen to like that sort of humor, great, but me, I got tired of being browbeaten with it by halfway through the movie.The only thing semi redeeming about this movie was the sophisticated stop motion photography that was used in creating the Monkeybone character.  It really is impressive to see what they pulled off, somewhat akin to the sort of stuff done in Who-Framed Roger Rabbit. It's a shame it was wasted in a movie that ended up being so painful to watch.Neat special effects don't make a movie.  Script, plot and acting do, and while Fraser and Kattan were decent in their parts, the rest was sorely lacking.  Not the most painful movie I've seen, but it's lurking down there nearby.About the DVD:Monkeybone comes in a standard hard case in 1.85:1 widescreen format with 5.1 Dolby digital sound.  It contains English and French audio tracks and English and Spanish subtitles.  The picture and sound are quite good.The cover of this DVD release claims that it's the SPECIAL EDITION.  Considering that there never was a regular DVD release of this movie, that label is a bit pretentious.  Of course, it does make up for it by being loaded with extra goodies, not that the extra goodies make up for the movie itself.Among the special features are, a director's commentary, 11 extended scenes, an alternate ending (both with optional director's commentary), 7 animation studies for scenes in the movie, a gallery of stills, and the obligatory theatrical trailers.The director's commentary is interesting, as he talks about what it took to put the movie together, mostly from a production point of view.  His commentary helps explain how certain scenes and shots were put together and the amount of work needed to make them solid and believable.  Interestingly, near the end of the commentary, there seems to be a sense of consternation in his conversation as he subtly wondered in a roundabout way why his movie hadn't done better in the box office.I'm not a film critic, but I probably could answer that one. It was just too off the wall, a little too weird and simply had humor that was too immature (and at one point, gross) for most audiences.  I certainly would suggest previewing this before letting kids watch it.Anyway, back to the point.  While all these goodies on the DVD are nice, they really don't make up for the fact that the movie itself is so poor.  2 stars for a decent DVD release and a not so good movie.",2,Monkeyblah,1071532800,"12 16, 2003",2003,4583,"['Synopsis', 'freak', 'car', 'crash', 'involving', 'giant', 'inflatable', 'monkey', 'cartoonist', 'Stu', 'Miley', 'Brenden', 'Fraser', 'coma', 'nightmarish', 'bizarre', 'world', 'called', 'Downtown', 'where', 'coma', 'patients', 'must', 'wait', 'ticket', 'back', 'aspect', 'twisted', 'personality', 'character', 'created', 'called', 'Monkeybone.As', 'Stu', 'limbo', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'girlfriend', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'waits', 'recover', 'sister', 'Kimmy', 'pull', 'plug', 'Monkeybone', 'Stu', 'discover', 'plans', 'try', 'escape', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'double-cross', 'nearly', 'dooms', 'Stu', 'life', 'altogether', 'Monkeybone', 'crazy', 'somewhat', 'raunchy', 'escapade', 'real', 'movie', 'found', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'painful', 'watch', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'think', 'something', 'bizarre', 'poorly', 'written', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'theaters', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'movie', 'one', 'pretty', 'odd', 'overall', 'script', 'par', 'best', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'spots', 'could', 'use', 'more', 'exposition', 'main', 'characters', 'definitely', 'needed', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'None', 'make', 'care', 'whit', 'what', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'nice', 'look', 'was', 'totally', 'luke-warm', 'role', 'Stu', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'had', 'much', 'work', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'character', 'so', 'neurotic', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', ""'d"", 'even', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'cameo', 'Death', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'yawner', 'well.This', 'not', 'mention', 'are', 'pretty', 'gross', 'things', 'movie', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'who', 'role', 'fantastic', 'physical', 'comedian', 'something', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'acting', 'running', 'around', 'reanimated', 'dead', 'guy', 'broken', 'neck', 'was', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'physical', 'comedy', 'bit', 'organs', 'falling', 'out', 'people', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'taste', 'more', 'little', 'gross.The', 'end', 'result', 'have', 'weak', 'movie', 'mainly', 'bodily', 'function', 'jokes', 'sexual', 'gags', 'almost', 'humor', 'most', 'extremely', 'low', 'brow', 'immature', 'sort', 'happen', 'like', 'sort', 'humor', 'great', 'got', 'tired', 'being', 'browbeaten', 'halfway', 'movie.The', 'only', 'thing', 'semi', 'redeeming', 'movie', 'was', 'sophisticated', 'stop', 'motion', 'photography', 'was', 'used', 'creating', 'Monkeybone', 'character', 'really', 'impressive', 'see', 'what', 'pulled', 'off', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'sort', 'stuff', 'done', 'Who-Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'shame', 'was', 'wasted', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'so', 'painful', 'watch.Neat', 'special', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'Script', 'plot', 'acting', 'do', 'Fraser', 'Kattan', 'were', 'decent', 'parts', 'rest', 'was', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'Not', 'most', 'painful', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lurking', 'down', 'there', 'DVD', 'Monkeybone', 'standard', 'hard', 'case', '1.85:1', 'widescreen', 'format', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'digital', 'sound', 'English', 'French', 'audio', 'tracks', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'quite', 'good.The', 'cover', 'DVD', 'release', 'SPECIAL', 'EDITION', 'Considering', 'never', 'was', 'regular', 'DVD', 'release', 'movie', 'label', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'course', 'make', 'up', 'being', 'loaded', 'extra', 'goodies', 'not', 'extra', 'goodies', 'make', 'up', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'director', 'commentary', '11', 'extended', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary', '7', 'animation', 'studies', 'scenes', 'movie', 'gallery', 'stills', 'obligatory', 'theatrical', 'trailers.The', 'director', 'commentary', 'interesting', 'what', 'took', 'put', 'movie', 'together', 'mostly', 'production', 'point', 'view', 'commentary', 'explain', 'how', 'certain', 'scenes', 'shots', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'amount', 'work', 'needed', 'make', 'solid', 'believable', 'Interestingly', 'end', 'commentary', 'be', 'sense', 'consternation', 'conversation', 'subtly', 'wondered', 'roundabout', 'way', 'why', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'better', 'box', 'office.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'film', 'critic', 'probably', 'could', 'answer', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'off', 'wall', 'little', 'too', 'weird', 'simply', 'had', 'humor', 'was', 'too', 'immature', 'one', 'point', 'gross', 'most', 'audiences', 'certainly', 'would', 'suggest', 'previewing', 'letting', 'kids', 'watch', 'it.Anyway', 'back', 'point', 'goodies', 'DVD', 'are', 'nice', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'fact', 'movie', 'so', 'poor', '2', 'stars', 'decent', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'movie']",Monkeybone

The place Miley ends up in his a transit point, apparently between life and death that those on the cusp visit.  It's gigged out like a weird carnival and populated by a bunch of puppets and CG animated creatures.  Inhabitants - piano playing blue elephants, seductive half-bees/half women - amuse themselves by watching other peoples' nightmares.  Some of the inhabitants get a ticket home, some are carted down below.  Together Miley and Monkeybone concoct a plan to steal a ticket, which is in turn stolen by Monkeybone - the little rapscallion - who takes over the out-of-the-coma body of the earth Stu Miley.So the premise has the screwball monkey enter the body of vanilla bland cartoonish.  The only part about MONKEYBONE I enjoyed - the etherworld stuff was slow moving and suffering from CGI toxicity - the only part I enjoyed was watching Brendan Fraser play the monkeybone possessed recoveree. He had a nice feel for goofy physical humor.Beyond that, the plot stunk, spent way too much time in the animatronic freak house, Bridget Fonda was wasted as the girl friend.  Most of the gags are pretty flat, though Fraser especially, and Fonda when the script allows, do their best.

526561,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXIS,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Based on the graphic novel ""Dark Town"" by Kaja Blackley, ""Monkeybone"" stars Brendan Fraser as most popular cartoonist Stu, who finds himself in a coma after a very unfortunate, and silly, car accident.  But don't take it seriously here; it's just a setup for a crazy ride that is to follow.The film is often called messy, and it is indeed.  While Stu is trapped in a mysterious world between death and life, it becomes clear.  A stop-motion animation monkey Stu created pops up there alive (and with a voice of one talented actor, regular of Coen Brothers films), and makes a havoc in this alternate world.  Very irritating monkey, but somehow he offers a help to send Stu back to life.  But, it's just the beginning.As you see soon after the opening credit, this monkey is a symbol of Stu's repressed sexual desire, and, well, those words ""monkey"" and ""bone"" are sometimes used as slang with very sexual connotation.  But the studio doesn't persue this theme too much, so kids may watch this without worrying the parents.  However, at the same time, because of this attitude and other reasons, the film is too timid for those who want to laugh heartily.Yes, some scenes are funny.  Chris Kattan playing the part of a ""Organ Doner"" is hilarious, being literally a ""dead man walking,"" but you have to wait more than one hour.  Wait is worth, but the film is, I thought, buried in its costly-looking  production designs.  They are really good, I assure you, and the director is Henry Selick, the one responsible for the magnificient ""The Nightmare Before Christmas.""  Fraser and Fonda both talented players look uncomfortable, not knowing what to do with the two-dementional characters and tepid gags.
