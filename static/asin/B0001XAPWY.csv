I won't get into why I think this movie is silly or bland to the point of being boring.  I'd be preaching to the choir from the looks of it.  And I won't bother prefacing by saying that I really like Pacino in other movies and think he's as good as his rep has him (usually).  Although I think he might have sunk this movie a bit.  Like the movie couldn't be its own thing because it got its dream lead in Pacino and turned it into a vanity project.  Too reverent, in other words, and not helping the cause.But the thing is I kept watching to see what would happen.  I did other things while the movie played, but I kept coming back.  So it did have some pull.  Maybe no more than a Law and Order episode.One silly thing I will mention.  The assistant.  The longhaired kid.  ""I want to go back to Seattle.  I want to go back to grunge.""  Wha?  I tried to figure out how long this movie has been on the shelf after that line.

Levenson ""chubbybuns""","[3, 4]","Upfront-This isn't Al Pacino's best ever role...indeed,it isn't even one of his best...The film,while choppy and toiling under a few plotline holes,nonetheless DOES have something to say...The fact that so many of the reviewers here have used the word""leftist"" and/or the term ""leftist conspiracy""when describing the story this film tells is instructional,and the fact that so many of these same reviewers scoff at the notion,or deride it ALONE make this a film worth looking at..I have to wonder if,perhaps,there is a right-wing denial agenda at work in those who made it thier whole point to be critical of the alledged""left wing""bias they claim to detect in this movie?Sure,""People I Know""is fiction,and as such deserves only our critical review with regard to plotting(note the afore-mentioned holes in this department)acting(great to excellent for the most part,especially Pacino)and directing(acceptable,if somewhat pedestrian),but since so many of the reviewers here have made it such a point to nitpick a FICTIONAL ""leftist""conspiracy that they see as being the whole point of this film,let me point out that,alas,in today's world the real evil comes,conspiratorially,from the right(and,let's be honest,hasn't it always?)...in a world in which a REAL right wing cabal,including both the president and the vice president can,among other things,SECRETLY involve us in an unnecessary war,while publicly lying in order to gain our support,can SECRETLY conspire with the fuel companies not only to keep us in that war but to deliver them massive profits at our expense,can SECRETLY conspire with extremist religious groups to defeat scientific truth,can SECRETLY establish and run prisons where captives are tortured into making bogus confessions,ect,ect,the desire to ""expose""the FICTIONAL ""leftist""paranoia alledgedly running throughout this film would be laughable except for the fact that these reviewers take it all so seriously...And,in the end,such reviews themselves become something of a right-wing conspiracy against truth,in that,in assaulting the crebibility of a FICTIONAL left-wing conspiracy they strive to divert our attentions away from all of those REAL LIFE everyday right-wing plots that have done so very much to destroy american prestige,and curtail the liberties guaranteed by the constitution and the bill of rights...Making a film about these right-wing plots,and the arrogance of those involved in them WOULD make a better,if a more frightening movie...",3,It's the thought that

It shows us how little it means anymore the principled against the option of a (political) career. The political left, by and large, has been institutionalized around few names and causes relevant today as name-dropping/historical material--see all references, spoken or visual, to the past scattered throughout the film.Eli Wurman, Pacino's character, is a relic of a time past who still leverages a reputation, a decreasing circle of friends, and a Harvard law degree, to defend the weak--in today's version, the post-9/11 illegal immigrants. The problem, we find, is that people, at best, find his events as opportunities to advance their agendas rather than move towards a common goal. Wurman is spent, slow to come to terms with the 'new realities,' a cunning and quixotic mix of individual who ponders getting the job done with doing the right thing; interesting tensions, portrayed well by Pacino. Donnie Brasco comes to mind as another film-role where Pacino's character is weathered down.Pacino's acting is just shy of excellent, while the supporting roles are inconsistent. Somehow, Kim Bassinger doesn't seem to fit the story very well; casting vs. screenplay problem. From the commentary option, we learn lots of tidbits, and about something that has come to plague lots of recent films: this film was turned rather quickly, without (enough) attention to details of interpretation or making. Such an approach is probably what leaves the attentive viewer with the feeling of everything goes or impromptu. Even actors such as Pacino and Bassinger cannot salvage such a production.All in all, this is a great and timely portrayal of a tired activist movement--a must see for the aware citizen.

816363,A34UFYMOMMRSMQ,B0001XAPWY,godzilla twain,"[2, 4]","People I Know is yet another dark drama with a stellar cast that ends up being boring, depressing, and a little too self-important for its own good.I had two major problems with the film. The first was that I could never sympathize with these characters. I care little for the angst of the rich and famous, and that's what this movie is centered around. All the characters care about is who they are seen with, where in the newspaper they are mentioned, and who they know. It's so shallow and meaningless that I had a hard time identifying with the characters much less feeling bad for Eli when he gets worked up about it. I believe the point of the movie was to emphasize just how shallow it all was, but that didn't make it any more entertaining for me.My second major problem with the movie was that it was depressing. If you like movies with happy endings, this isn't it. The story spends most of its time wallowing in the characters' problems then ends up hammering them flat at the end. There wasn't enough payoff at the end to make it worth watching the torture. The film also portrays blacks, Jews, and liberals in general as corrupt, power hungry individuals who are more interested in themselves than the causes they represent.Al Pacino is pretty good as Eli Wurman. He looks frazzled, ragged, and generally burned out. I don't think it took Pacino much to look that way, but the role suited him. Kim Basinger is barely on the screen as Victoria Gray, Eli's sister-in-law. She's sweet and pretty in the film, but it's hard to believe that she'd be romantically interested in Eli beyond the fact that he's a lot like her deceased husband. T&eacute;a Leoni is also barely in the film as Jilli Hopper. She also nails the look of a burned out, drug addicted actress. Unfortunately, the bulk of her performance involves her acting stoned. Ryan O'Neal also has a cameo as Cary Launer, a supposedly superstar actor with a menacing presence. I had a hard time buying Cary as a heavy, so the revelations about him at the end were a bit hard to swallow.All in all, I was disappointed by People I Know. I usually like the movies that these stars are in, but the story just didn't do it for me.",2,This movie is only for die hard fans of Pacino,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,2192,"['People', 'Know', 'yet', 'dark', 'drama', 'stellar', 'cast', 'up', 'being', 'boring', 'depressing', 'little', 'too', 'self-important', 'own', 'good.I', 'had', 'two', 'major', 'problems', 'film', 'first', 'was', 'could', 'never', 'sympathize', 'characters', 'care', 'little', 'angst', 'rich', 'famous', 'what', 'movie', 'centered', 'characters', 'care', 'who', 'are', 'seen', 'where', 'newspaper', 'are', 'mentioned', 'who', 'know', 'so', 'shallow', 'meaningless', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'identifying', 'characters', 'much', 'less', 'feeling', 'bad', 'Eli', 'when', 'worked', 'up', 'believe', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'emphasize', 'just', 'how', 'shallow', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'entertaining', 'me.My', 'second', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'depressing', 'like', 'movies', 'happy', 'endings', ""n't"", 'story', 'most', 'time', 'wallowing', 'characters', 'problems', 'then', 'up', 'hammering', 'flat', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'payoff', 'end', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'torture', 'film', 'also', 'blacks', 'Jews', 'liberals', 'general', 'corrupt', 'power', 'hungry', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'causes', 'represent.Al', 'Pacino', 'pretty', 'good', 'Eli', 'Wurman', 'frazzled', 'ragged', 'generally', 'burned', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'took', 'Pacino', 'much', 'look', 'way', 'role', 'suited', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'barely', 'screen', 'Victoria', 'Gray', 'Eli', 'sister-in-law', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'film', 'hard', 'believe', ""'d"", 'be', 'romantically', 'interested', 'Eli', 'fact', 'lot', 'deceased', 'husband', 'T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'also', 'barely', 'film', 'Jilli', 'Hopper', 'also', 'look', 'burned', 'out', 'drug', 'addicted', 'actress', 'Unfortunately', 'bulk', 'performance', 'acting', 'stoned', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'also', 'cameo', 'Cary', 'Launer', 'supposedly', 'superstar', 'actor', 'menacing', 'presence', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'buying', 'Cary', 'heavy', 'revelations', 'end', 'were', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow.All', 'was', 'disappointed', 'People', 'Know', 'usually', 'movies', 'stars', 'are', 'story', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do']",N/A

New York politics, and beyond American politics seen through the eyes of a mediocre, Jewish PR agent who is losing his main customer and who is still giving time to Afro-American causes not understanding that they don't want and they don't need white Jewish good-doing benevolent liberals to take care of them. They have come of age and start understanding they have to take care of themselves. On the other side, the supposedly liberal white politicians have become so corrupted that they cannot stand upright any more and they just want to lie low and disappear from the public eye before it's too late. A new generation has not come out of the wings yet and they are more or less obliged to last a little longer. The subject of the film is that trite and that superficial if not superfluous, and the final murder does not add anything to this rather thin plot. Yet the film is a rather good film because Al Pacino is acting his part so well that he really looks the part of the poor absolutely conscious old man who is doing one more gig before going out for ever to some solitary and telephone-deprived barn on a Virginia farm. Is he overacting as some think? I don't think so. In fact he is surrounded by actors who are second zone as compared to him, so that what is good acting looks like overacting against that background. The real question is then why did Al Pacino accept to act in a film with no one next to him that could compete with his long experience and his phenomenal professional profile? No one can answer this question, except Al Pacino himself. But that is often what happens with aging actors. They are only proposed films that are made for them individually so that they end up shining bright in a dark alley and blinding us at the same time instead of making other actors sparkle and glow.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,Aging alone is sad for an actor,1194393600,"11 7, 2007",2007,2134,"['film', 'period', 'come', 'end', 'complete', 'end', 'earthquake', 'mudslide', 'volcanic', 'eruption', 'known', 'Twin', 'Tower', 'Terrorist', 'Attack', '9/11', 'short', 'New', 'York', 'politics', 'American', 'politics', 'seen', 'eyes', 'mediocre', 'Jewish', 'PR', 'agent', 'who', 'losing', 'main', 'customer', 'who', 'still', 'giving', 'time', 'Afro-American', 'causes', 'not', 'understanding', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'white', 'Jewish', 'good-doing', 'benevolent', 'liberals', 'take', 'care', 'have', 'come', 'age', 'start', 'understanding', 'have', 'take', 'care', 'other', 'side', 'supposedly', 'liberal', 'white', 'politicians', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'corrupted', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'upright', 'more', 'just', 'want', 'lie', 'low', 'disappear', 'public', 'eye', 'too', 'late', 'new', 'generation', 'not', 'come', 'wings', 'yet', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'obliged', 'last', 'little', 'longer', 'subject', 'film', 'trite', 'superficial', 'not', 'superfluous', 'final', 'murder', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'rather', 'thin', 'plot', 'film', 'rather', 'good', 'film', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'acting', 'part', 'so', 'well', 'really', 'part', 'poor', 'absolutely', 'conscious', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'doing', 'one', 'more', 'gig', 'going', 'out', 'ever', 'solitary', 'telephone-deprived', 'barn', 'Virginia', 'farm', 'overacting', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'fact', 'surrounded', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'second', 'zone', 'compared', 'so', 'what', 'good', 'acting', 'looks', 'overacting', 'background', 'real', 'question', 'then', 'why', 'did', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'accept', 'act', 'film', 'one', 'next', 'could', 'compete', 'long', 'experience', 'phenomenal', 'professional', 'profile', 'one', 'can', 'answer', 'question', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'often', 'what', 'aging', 'actors', 'are', 'only', 'proposed', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'individually', 'so', 'end', 'up', 'shining', 'bright', 'dark', 'alley', 'blinding', 'same', 'time', 'instead', 'making', 'other', 'actors', 'sparkle', 'glow.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A
816367,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001XAPWY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","It is hard to pass by an Al Pacino movie that you have not seen, but chances are ""People I Know"" is not going to add to your life experience.  I think a lot of people never heard about this film in theatrical release: it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival and then went into limited release (which means it did not come here).  But they caught the trailer on another DVD and decided to check it out (that is my excuse).  On the plus side this 2002 film has the virtue of not being predictable, because while the fate of Pacino's character did not surprise me the ending of the film, which is somewhat abrupt, certainly did.  But in the end most viewers will find this a disappointing film.Pacino plays Eli Wurman, a publicist who in his heyday rubbed elbows with everybody who was anybody in the liberal New York City scene, including the secular saints Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy.  Now he has one big name client, Cary Launer (Ryan O'Neal), a movie star with something of a dark side who has political ambitions.  Sent out into the night to deal with Launer's ranting and raving drugged out mistress, Jilli Hopper (T&eacute;a Leoni), Eli gives her some pills to pop and takes some himself.  So while we know what Eli sees happen that night really happened, Eli himself is not so clear.  There is a moral conflict established for the character at this point, hedged by the uncertainty of his memory, but Eli is more concerned with trying to get A-list people to his fundraiser.Eli has come to the end of the road in his career as a publicist, at least in part because he clings to the past, both in terms of his memories (all those photos hanging on the wall) and technology (he refuses to use a cell phone).  Now he has reached a moment when he is going to sink or swim.  The problem is that he dislikes both his life and by extension himself.  When he slowly comes to the realization that he is caught up in a conspiracy involving drug, murder, and politics instead of springing into act he pretty much grinds to a halt.  This is what makes the ending of this film by director Dan Algrant (""Naked in the City"") film inevitable but still someone unexpected.In terms of performances Pacino certainly captures the weariness of Eli's troubled existence, but the Southern accent (Georgia?) is certainly bothersome.  O'Neal does a nice job of playing the bad guy, giving his boyish good looks and easy going charm a rather chilling coldness.  Leoni gives a nice turn as her character explodes and then implodes in her brief scenes and Kim Basinger plays Eli's widowed sister-in-law who offers him, if not a chance at redemption, at least a way out of the living hell he is descending into.  Richard Schiff plays  Elliot Sharansky, who would be the devil perched on one shoulder if Basinger is the angel on the other.  A publicist has to make the right decisions for his clients, and the irony of ""People I Know"" is that Pacino's Eli makes nothing but the wrong decisions for himself.",3,Al Pacino's character is going down for the third time,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,2997,"['hard', 'pass', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'chances', 'are', 'People', 'Know', 'not', 'going', 'add', 'life', 'experience', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'debuted', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'then', 'went', 'limited', 'release', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'here', 'caught', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'excuse', 'plus', 'side', '2002', 'film', 'virtue', 'not', 'being', 'predictable', 'fate', 'Pacino', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'surprise', 'ending', 'film', 'somewhat', 'abrupt', 'certainly', 'did', 'end', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'disappointing', 'film.Pacino', 'plays', 'Eli', 'Wurman', 'publicist', 'who', 'heyday', 'rubbed', 'elbows', 'everybody', 'who', 'was', 'anybody', 'liberal', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'scene', 'including', 'secular', 'saints', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'Now', 'one', 'big', 'name', 'client', 'Cary', 'Launer', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'movie', 'star', 'something', 'dark', 'side', 'who', 'political', 'ambitions', 'Sent', 'out', 'night', 'deal', 'Launer', 'ranting', 'raving', 'drugged', 'out', 'mistress', 'Jilli', 'Hopper', 'T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'Eli', 'pills', 'pop', 'So', 'know', 'what', 'Eli', 'happen', 'night', 'really', 'happened', 'Eli', 'not', 'so', 'clear', 'moral', 'conflict', 'established', 'character', 'point', 'hedged', 'uncertainty', 'memory', 'Eli', 'more', 'concerned', 'trying', 'get', 'A-list', 'people', 'fundraiser.Eli', 'come', 'end', 'road', 'career', 'publicist', 'least', 'part', 'past', 'terms', 'memories', 'photos', 'hanging', 'wall', 'technology', 'use', 'cell', 'phone', 'Now', 'reached', 'moment', 'when', 'going', 'sink', 'swim', 'problem', 'life', 'extension', 'When', 'slowly', 'realization', 'caught', 'up', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'drug', 'murder', 'politics', 'instead', 'springing', 'act', 'pretty', 'much', 'grinds', 'halt', 'ending', 'film', 'director', 'Dan', 'Algrant', 'Naked', 'City', 'film', 'inevitable', 'still', 'someone', 'unexpected.In', 'terms', 'performances', 'Pacino', 'certainly', 'weariness', 'Eli', 'troubled', 'existence', 'Southern', 'accent', 'Georgia', 'certainly', 'bothersome', ""O'Neal"", 'nice', 'job', 'playing', 'bad', 'guy', 'giving', 'boyish', 'good', 'looks', 'easy', 'going', 'charm', 'rather', 'chilling', 'coldness', 'Leoni', 'nice', 'turn', 'character', 'explodes', 'then', 'implodes', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Eli', 'widowed', 'sister-in-law', 'who', 'not', 'chance', 'redemption', 'least', 'way', 'living', 'hell', 'descending', 'Richard', 'Schiff', 'Elliot', 'Sharansky', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'devil', 'perched', 'one', 'shoulder', 'Basinger', 'angel', 'other', 'publicist', 'make', 'right', 'decisions', 'clients', 'irony', 'People', 'Know', 'Pacino', 'Eli', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'decisions']",N/A

Then how come I never heard about it until I saw a trailer on a DVD I recently rented?  How come it didn't last in the theaters? I don't have an answer to that because I believe that if it had the right publicity it might have done better in the box office department.Talking about publicity, it seems ironic but this is what the film is about. Al Pacino is cast as Eli Wurman, an aging New York publicist who is planning a fundraiser.  It's for the kind of cause, however, that has seen its glory in the 1960s, and the cause seems old and tired, as does Eli.  With the skill of a good makeup artist, Pacino looks dissipated.  He has sagging jowls and dark bags under his eyes.  But his voice is strong and, in spite of the fact that the character he portrays is constantly popping tremendous amounts of prescription drugs, his strong personality comes through.  There's a frantic pace about this film, which includes politics, drugs and questionable ethics.Kim Bassinger plays his sister-in-law who gives him a chance at another way of life.  Tea Leoni plays a high-priced model who's hooked on every kind of drug imaginable and who's the girlfriend of a politician.  Then there are the real life newscasters and personalities who all make their entrance to give the film it's gritty reality, such as former NY City Police chief William Bratton, TV host Regis Philbin, critic Rex Reed and  newscaster Pat Kiernan to name just a few.I liked the New York scene the film portrayed.

Once the friend and confidant of the entertainment elite, he has only one remaining A-list client, playboy movie star Cary Launer (Ryan O'Neal). Undaunted in his support of humanitarian causes, Eli insists that Cary speak at a charity benefit that he is organizing when Cary asks him to do some dirty work -bail a girlfriend out of jail. After bailing Jilly (Tea Leoni) out, Eli reluctantly takes her to look for an important item that she has lost. The next day, while frantically trying to organize his charity benefit, a drug-addled Eli tries to piece together what he saw the night before and what it might mean.&quot;People I Know&quot; is a hybrid political thriller and character study. As a political thriller it's interesting, but not thrilling enough. It spares no one in its revelation of the hypocrisy and abuse of power behind a New York Senate race. The indictment of the city's most prominent citizens, although obviously unrealistic, is unsettling enough to be interesting. The film's best scenes feature Richard Schiff being ruthless as eminent businessman Elliot Sharansky. Al Pacino's Eli Wurman doesn't fare so well. The film takes place over a period of only about 26 hours, during which Eli is unraveling, both emotionally and physically, all while organizing a benefit and getting caught up in political intrigues beyond his control. I wish the film had the urgency that the situation implies. Eli still has a salesman's pitch, but is drug-dependent and only intermittently lucid. This doesn't really work. It makes him difficult to watch and only passively involved in what's going on. It doesn't help that Pacino's Georgian accent is as inconsistent as his character's thought processes. &quot;People I Know&quot;, like Eli, has some moments of clarity, but it needed to be a lot tighter.The DVD: Bonus features include 2 deleted scenes, with commentary, and an audio commentary by director Dan Algrant and Gregory Mosher, who has nothing to do with the film. Mosher is a writer and director himself and must be a friend of Algrant's. This arrangement works better than I might expect. Mosher is able to point out elements of the film from the perspective of a viewer, which Algrant can then comment on. The commentary is about filming -the actors, make-up, wardrobe, anecdotes, etc.- not about the film's themes.

816375,A3SF2N0BJF0YJS,B0001XAPWY,N. Caine,"[6, 16]","Problems with a feature film usually start with the script.  ""People I Know"" isn't any different.  The meandering script alternates between being a character study of the aging has-been publicist and a suspense thriller involving a secret (unfortunately) Jewish cabal which controls politics and finance in New York at the same time as its few members (a billionaire Jewish financier, a rabbi, a prominent Jewish doctor, and an ACLU board member) engage in a drug and sex orgy straight out of ""Eyes Wide Shut.""The suspense thriller is the far more interesting part of the movie, though why it has to be a Jewish cabal, and thus play on the worst of the Anti-Semitic myths perpetuated by the ""Protocals of the Elders of Zion,"" totally escapes me.  But where this part of the story intersects with the character study is an obvious and total mess.  The cabal wants back from Eli, the protagonist publicist, an incriminating recording of an ""Eyes Wide Shut"" evening.  Eli carries it around in his coat pocket the whole time, but though the cabal doesn't hesitate to resort to murder and intrigue, and they even corner Eli in their headquarters and demand it, they don't bother to frisk him?  It's truly bizarre, like two scripts which can't intersect logically.As to the character study, it doesn't stand a chance by casting Pacino as the lead and the luminescent Kim Basinger as the widow who pursues him.  I love Al Pacino most of the time, but he's too charismatic and strong to pull off a guy who is supposed to be something of a wet noodle who at the same time is doggedly single minded about keeping doing what he's always been doing (second rate publicist work).  Pacino tries to accomplish this by feigning a Southern accent so pronounced as to make him sound more effeminate and silly than pathetic.  To have Kim Basinger chasing after him and him not respond is so unbelievable that I thought at first he was supposed to be a closeted gay -- which would have been a fascinating twist--  and hence Pacino's effeminate drawl, but nope, it's just bad casting.I have read some reviews of the film and it has now been explained to me that Eli is fighting a battle between old New York Jewish idealism and new New York self-interested egotism.  Pacino doesn't pull it off and neither does the script.  I watched the film closely and I saw little character issue with it.  In the few moments when this is dealt with directly, the film falls back into its monotonous repetition that Eli is old and tired and doesn't know when to call it quits.I read Ebert's interview with Pacino in which Pacino said he wanted the film done in an edgy, all digital style.  That might have been an interesting way to watch Eli's descent.  But that's not at all the way it was filmed.  Whatever its budget, the film is glossy and sleek, looking like any first run theatrical release, and against this backdrop, Pacino's character just seems an overwrought, boring, illogical oddity, not a reflection of an inner turmoil.",1,A miscast misfire,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,3001,"['Problems', 'feature', 'film', 'usually', 'start', 'script', 'People', 'Know', ""n't"", 'different', 'meandering', 'script', 'alternates', 'being', 'character', 'study', 'aging', 'has-been', 'publicist', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'involving', 'secret', 'unfortunately', 'Jewish', 'cabal', 'politics', 'finance', 'New', 'York', 'same', 'time', 'few', 'members', 'billionaire', 'Jewish', 'financier', 'rabbi', 'prominent', 'Jewish', 'doctor', 'ACLU', 'board', 'member', 'engage', 'drug', 'sex', 'orgy', 'straight', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'part', 'movie', 'why', 'be', 'Jewish', 'cabal', 'thus', 'play', 'worst', 'Anti-Semitic', 'myths', 'perpetuated', 'Protocals', 'Elders', 'Zion', 'totally', 'where', 'part', 'story', 'character', 'study', 'obvious', 'total', 'mess', 'cabal', 'back', 'Eli', 'protagonist', 'publicist', 'incriminating', 'recording', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'evening', 'Eli', 'around', 'coat', 'pocket', 'whole', 'time', 'cabal', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'resort', 'murder', 'intrigue', 'even', 'corner', 'Eli', 'headquarters', 'demand', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'frisk', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'two', 'scripts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'intersect', 'logically.As', 'character', 'study', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'casting', 'Pacino', 'lead', 'luminescent', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'widow', 'who', 'love', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'most', 'time', 'too', 'charismatic', 'strong', 'pull', 'off', 'guy', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'something', 'wet', 'noodle', 'who', 'same', 'time', 'doggedly', 'single', 'minded', 'keeping', 'doing', 'what', 'always', 'been', 'doing', 'second', 'rate', 'publicist', 'work', 'Pacino', 'accomplish', 'feigning', 'Southern', 'accent', 'so', 'pronounced', 'make', 'sound', 'more', 'effeminate', 'silly', 'pathetic', 'have', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'chasing', 'not', 'respond', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'thought', 'first', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'closeted', 'gay', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'twist', 'hence', 'Pacino', 'effeminate', 'drawl', 'nope', 'just', 'bad', 'casting.I', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'film', 'now', 'been', 'explained', 'Eli', 'fighting', 'battle', 'old', 'New', 'York', 'Jewish', 'idealism', 'new', 'New', 'York', 'self-interested', 'egotism', 'Pacino', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'neither', 'script', 'watched', 'film', 'closely', 'saw', 'little', 'character', 'issue', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'dealt', 'directly', 'film', 'back', 'monotonous', 'repetition', 'Eli', 'old', 'tired', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'call', 'quits.I', 'read', 'Ebert', 'interview', 'Pacino', 'Pacino', 'said', 'wanted', 'film', 'done', 'edgy', 'digital', 'style', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'way', 'watch', 'Eli', 'descent', 'not', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'Whatever', 'budget', 'film', 'glossy', 'sleek', 'looking', 'first', 'run', 'theatrical', 'release', 'backdrop', 'Pacino', 'character', 'just', 'overwrought', 'boring', 'illogical', 'oddity', 'not', 'reflection', 'inner', 'turmoil']",N/A
816376,A2UM70SXX6TY30,B0001XAPWY,"Ned K. Wynn ""EKW""","[6, 14]","People I Know is not a good film. It is a pretentious 60's paranoid liberal fantasy which takes itself way too seriously. It remained unreleased for two years on good grounds. There are many reasons for this, but the main culprit is poor writing. The screenplay is filled with half-baked ideas and storylines that start up and then peter out without creating any coherent arc. It's as if a bunch of college kids wacked on smoke threw all their retreaded movie head trips and their late night dorm save the world scenarios into a pot and tried to call it a movie script. However it's not the work of a bunch of stoned college kids but of one man, Jon Robin Bates. Bates has been praised to the stars for some of his theatrical work, but insofar as this film is concerned he misses on every level. There is no sustained tension, just a bunch of little fizzy sparks struck almost haphazardly which are quickly extinguished in this turgid, somnolent tale about a broken down New York press agent trying to hold his life - and a horrible Southern accent - together and get one more good cause served before he goes out like a candle. Without sustained tension there is no pace. Pace does not mean speed or excitement, it means the sustaining of interest in what is happening. This screenplay fails to deliver all around. No pace, no momentum, no momentum creates a waning of interest. Each twist and turn leads nowhere. The acting is good, but it is all in the service of a truly mind-numbing nightmare. There are set-ups without payoffs, portentous meetings without consequences until the final consequence which is not logical given the putative intelligence of the main characters.

816377,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B0001XAPWY,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[1, 1]","What a great cast of actors: Al Pacino (who plays public relations executive Eli), Tea Leoni, Ryan O'Neill and Kim Basinger.  Story is set in New York, city that never sleeps and it takes place during a single day.  Al Pacino's character Eli is used to be very successful: he was fourth in his class at Harward Law School; but sold out to serve Holywood stars in their quest to cover up their own public indiscretions.  His biggest client is an actor (played by O'Neill - perfect fit for the characted of modern day Dorian Gray) whose model girlfriend needs to be discreetly bailed out from the police station.  Drugs, corruption, political intrigue and power play start to unfold.  Suddenly, this public relations executive who is supposed to hide everyone else's secret finds himself in a situation where he knows too much.I was really touched by Pacino's character's relationship with his sister-in-law Victoria (played by Bassinger).  Victoria's husband / Eli's brother committed suicide.  At times it seems that both are baffled on why his suicide took place, but soon it becomes apparent that Victoria and Eli are deeply in love with each other.  At one point Eli rflects that he missed an opportunity to marry Victoria when he had a chance.  Could that be the reason why Eli's brother committed suicide?  Could Eli's brother have known that the two were in love with one another but never consummed the relationship - which only made the situation worse?  Eli has never married in spite of not being intimate with Victoria.  But two of them are so tender with each other.  Even when Eli sends flowers to Victoria in her hotel room, he does it with so much attention to detail - he sends her magnolias (because Eli is originally from Georgia).I have enjoyed Pacino's performance a lot.  I have never seen an actor play a person so exhausted from life, seeking for peace, solitude, love, escape from personal loneliness, desire to connect with one and only person he truly loves (Victoria) in spite of stigma that she is his brother's widow.  One wants so bad for character of Eli to break away from all the dread and turmoil of living on Xanax, Ambien and tons of other drugs prescribed to him by his personal doctor he calls ""Dr. Feel Good"".  Director displays great detail on showing how this once talented man Eli, who had it all is slowly slipping - he is wearing cashmere black winter coat, but his suit is striped and so is his shirt - a mismatch that probably would not happen in her early career.  His tie is undone and hair dishevelled.  Still, Eli wears his Hermes tie and carries on even if it means he is living from day to day.Impressionable movie, perhaps not for everyone's taste, but definitely compelling and in the end - heartbreaking.",5,Washed out public relations executive thriller,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,2759,"['What', 'great', 'cast', 'actors', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'public', 'relations', 'executive', 'Eli', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'Ryan', ""O'Neill"", 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Story', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'never', 'place', 'single', 'day', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'character', 'Eli', 'used', 'be', 'very', 'successful', 'was', 'fourth', 'class', 'Harward', 'Law', 'School', 'sold', 'out', 'serve', 'Holywood', 'stars', 'quest', 'cover', 'up', 'own', 'public', 'indiscretions', 'biggest', 'client', 'actor', 'played', ""O'Neill"", 'perfect', 'fit', 'characted', 'modern', 'day', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'model', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'discreetly', 'bailed', 'out', 'police', 'station', 'Drugs', 'corruption', 'political', 'intrigue', 'power', 'play', 'start', 'unfold', 'Suddenly', 'public', 'relations', 'executive', 'who', 'supposed', 'hide', 'everyone', 'else', 'secret', 'situation', 'where', 'too', 'much.I', 'was', 'really', 'touched', 'Pacino', 'character', 'relationship', 'sister-in-law', 'Victoria', 'played', 'Bassinger', 'Victoria', 'husband', '/', 'Eli', 'brother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'times', 'are', 'baffled', 'why', 'suicide', 'took', 'place', 'soon', 'apparent', 'Victoria', 'Eli', 'are', 'deeply', 'love', 'other', 'one', 'point', 'Eli', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'marry', 'Victoria', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 'Could', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'Eli', 'brother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Could', 'Eli', 'brother', 'have', 'known', 'two', 'were', 'love', 'one', 'never', 'consummed', 'relationship', 'only', 'made', 'situation', 'worse', 'Eli', 'never', 'married', 'spite', 'not', 'being', 'intimate', 'Victoria', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'tender', 'other', 'Even', 'when', 'Eli', 'flowers', 'Victoria', 'hotel', 'room', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'detail', 'magnolias', 'Eli', 'originally', 'Georgia', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Pacino', 'performance', 'lot', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'actor', 'play', 'person', 'so', 'exhausted', 'life', 'seeking', 'peace', 'solitude', 'love', 'escape', 'personal', 'loneliness', 'desire', 'connect', 'one', 'only', 'person', 'loves', 'Victoria', 'spite', 'stigma', 'brother', 'widow', 'One', 'so', 'bad', 'character', 'Eli', 'break', 'away', 'dread', 'turmoil', 'living', 'Xanax', 'Ambien', 'tons', 'other', 'drugs', 'prescribed', 'personal', 'doctor', 'Dr.', 'Feel', 'Good', 'Director', 'great', 'detail', 'showing', 'how', 'once', 'talented', 'man', 'Eli', 'who', 'had', 'slowly', 'slipping', 'wearing', 'cashmere', 'black', 'winter', 'coat', 'suit', 'striped', 'so', 'shirt', 'mismatch', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'happen', 'early', 'career', 'tie', 'undone', 'hair', 'dishevelled', 'Still', 'Eli', 'Hermes', 'tie', 'even', 'living', 'day', 'day.Impressionable', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'definitely', 'compelling', 'end', 'heartbreaking']",N/A

He brandishes his characteristic fresh-off-a-cubbyhole look, eyes haggard face drawn and hair in a perpetual rooster-comb, growing increasingly haunted as a sleepless PR agent who spills gobs of buttered lies to keep himself in business and his clients out of trouble. Kim Basinger is adequate but uninspired in her accessory role.Much of the self-important sobstory stuff may be grossly incredible but as a sharp jab at the prevailing strain of New York showbiz sentimentality, it's gruesome and on the nose. There's even a subplot involving a power struggle between a wealthy industrialist and a primping social-activist that calls to mind touches of Bonfire of the Vanities.On the flipside, it does suffer from somewhat over-baked characterization. The chatty, even preachy script shrouds in a politically charged thriller what would have been a bare-bones character study; the result is not really all that charged but fiendishly insightful so it keeps us hooked. The final shot is so fascinating it made me forgive all the cracks that came before it.Certainly a rental if you want to snuggle up with an offbeat but somewhat heavy theme.",3,INDULGENT BUT FLAGRANT BLACK COMEDY,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,1384,"['Not', 'sure', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'went', 'fairly', 'recent', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'vicious', 'reviews', 'suggest', 'Even', 'casual', 'observer', 'would', 'see', 'screenplay', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Pacino', 'specifically', 'mind', 'characteristic', 'fresh-off-a-cubbyhole', 'look', 'eyes', 'haggard', 'face', 'drawn', 'hair', 'perpetual', 'rooster-comb', 'growing', 'increasingly', 'haunted', 'sleepless', 'PR', 'agent', 'who', 'gobs', 'buttered', 'lies', 'keep', 'business', 'clients', 'trouble', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'adequate', 'uninspired', 'accessory', 'role.Much', 'self-important', 'sobstory', 'stuff', 'may', 'be', 'grossly', 'incredible', 'sharp', 'jab', 'prevailing', 'strain', 'New', 'York', 'showbiz', 'sentimentality', 'gruesome', 'nose', 'even', 'subplot', 'involving', 'power', 'struggle', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'primping', 'social-activist', 'mind', 'touches', 'Bonfire', 'Vanities.On', 'flipside', 'suffer', 'somewhat', 'over-baked', 'characterization', 'chatty', 'even', 'preachy', 'script', 'shrouds', 'politically', 'charged', 'thriller', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bare-bones', 'character', 'study', 'result', 'not', 'really', 'charged', 'fiendishly', 'insightful', 'hooked', 'final', 'shot', 'so', 'fascinating', 'made', 'forgive', 'cracks', 'came', 'it.Certainly', 'rental', 'want', 'snuggle', 'up', 'offbeat', 'somewhat', 'heavy', 'theme']",N/A
