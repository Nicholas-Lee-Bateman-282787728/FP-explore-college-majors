If you're a fan of old tv like me the ideal is a well restored program as originally broadcast ( commercials too in some cases). In this set the show's openings and closings are even edited. Most shows in the set just start with the action, NO THEME, NO OPENING OR CLOSING. Instead you have some would-be announcer/tv historian narrating an intro to each episode. WITHOUT DOUBT THE  WORST JOB OF A TV SET I'VE SEEN. O & H is a great old show, that's the one redeeming value here, but hardly worth the annoyance. Especially since there are now some well done sets out on dvd (and some adequate ones in vhs if you want).

Schoditsch,"[17, 18]","The Adventures of Ozzie And Harriet - a pleasant perusal of the real life Nelson family portraying the fictional middle American family, The Nelsons.  Viewing the first disc, and keeping an open mind as to the date of the material, I found myself chuckling at most of the punchlines and wishing I had a neighbor like Thorny.  Ozzie's dry wit, Harriet's clever come backs, Ricky and his 'early' precociousness with David portraying the straight man provide silly and harmless laughs for anyone.The quality of this set?  Horrible, by today's standards.  With 435 episodes in the public domain and really only appealing to an older demographic, we may never see the digital restoration this American treasure deserves.  So for the time being just enjoy this delightful set that spans over the entire run of the series.

Sophisticates see it as hokey saccharin family comedy (despite the fact that most American families were two parent households for the time period of the series). What O&amp;H is is a simple, wholesome family sit com that was enormously popular for over a decade - and with good reason. It is warm, family-friendly, amusing (though rarely hilarious - the laugh track is over the top), and people could relate to the situations that still seem familiar to most people. It is too bad that this box set concentrates on the last few years - O&amp;H was at its best when Ricky and David were kids and not married.

466386,A3B79JJXKMM9ZH,6305488215,"R. L. Towler ""Blatzman""","[29, 29]","I just received this set today. I mainly got it because there are a handful of episodes in this set that I don't have. In all fairness, the quality of these episodes isn't all that great, as stated by another person. I offer the following explanation as to why this is. First off, all of the episodes in this set are in public domain. That means that anyone can copy them without copyright infringement. That is why most of these episodes are available from so may different companies on DVD & VHS. Second, all of these episodes have been copied from 16mm films. I believe that during the show's initial run, many of the episodes were transfered to 16mm film to be shown overseas to our armed forces stationed in other countries. (The Amos n' Andy show was also transfered to 16mm for the same reason) This is also true of the last season of Ozzie & Harriet, which was shown on TV in color. For some reason, the color episodes were copied in black & white and transfered to 16mm film. Unfortunately, time has not been very kind to these films, many of the older films have faded with age or have been spliced and taped together and the end result is blurry and jumpy pictures, the audio usually suffers too. There are roughly 50 to 60 episodes of this series in public domain. There may be less, this is just a guess on my part. The rest of the episodes that are not in public domain, roughly 360 are copyrighted and the copyright belongs to Mr. David Oswald Nelson, the only surviving member of the original TV family. It's up to him to release the rest of the episodes. Hopefully, one day soon he will do this.. I'm almost certain there are original copies in the Library of Congress, but as to what condition they are in is anybody's guess. So, I will only recommend this to a diehard, ""The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet"" fan. They may not be the best, but they are the only thing out there at the moment and the episodes are all still very watchable.",3,The quality isn't that great.....but,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,1954,"['just', 'received', 'set', 'today', 'mainly', 'got', 'are', 'handful', 'episodes', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'fairness', 'quality', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'great', 'stated', 'person', 'offer', 'following', 'explanation', 'why', 'First', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'public', 'domain', 'anyone', 'can', 'copy', 'copyright', 'infringement', 'why', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'so', 'may', 'different', 'companies', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'Second', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'copied', '16mm', 'films', 'believe', 'show', 'initial', 'run', 'many', 'episodes', 'were', 'transfered', '16mm', 'film', 'be', 'shown', 'overseas', 'armed', 'forces', 'stationed', 'other', 'countries', 'Amos', 'n', 'Andy', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'transfered', '16mm', 'same', 'reason', 'also', 'true', 'last', 'season', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', 'color', 'reason', 'color', 'episodes', 'were', 'copied', 'black', 'white', 'transfered', '16mm', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'very', 'kind', 'films', 'many', 'older', 'films', 'have', 'faded', 'age', 'have', 'been', 'spliced', 'taped', 'together', 'end', 'result', 'blurry', 'jumpy', 'pictures', 'audio', 'usually', 'too', 'are', 'roughly', '50', '60', 'episodes', 'series', 'public', 'domain', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'just', 'guess', 'part', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'public', 'domain', 'roughly', '360', 'are', 'copyrighted', 'copyright', 'Mr.', 'David', 'Oswald', 'Nelson', 'only', 'surviving', 'member', 'original', 'TV', 'family', 'up', 'release', 'rest', 'episodes', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'soon', 'will', 'do', 'this..', ""'m"", 'almost', 'certain', 'are', 'original', 'copies', 'Library', 'Congress', 'what', 'condition', 'are', 'anybody', 'guess', 'So', 'will', 'only', 'recommend', 'diehard', 'Adventures', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'fan', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'are', 'only', 'thing', 'there', 'moment', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'watchable']",Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet VHS
