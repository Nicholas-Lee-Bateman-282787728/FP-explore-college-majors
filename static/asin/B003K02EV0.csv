1347872,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B003K02EV0,Amit Talpade,"[0, 0]","Humungous expectations have preceded this movie and stars one of the biggest stars of the Indian Film Industry Shahrukh Khan who has thus far given two flops i.e. Billu Barber and Dulha Mil Gaya, although they were not considered to be noteworthy to begin with.Karan Johar who began his career with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai has started to venture in to serious cinema territory with Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna has also tried to maintain this stance with his production house producing diverse fares such as Dostana and Wake up Sid.Even before the release this movie was in the hot water with the Shiv Sena, a right wing party prevented its release because of statements made by Shahrukh about some Pakistani cricket players.The foray of Fox Search Light pictures in Bollywood with the payment of an obscene amount of rupees for the rights, they hope to have a successful launch where Sony stumbled with Saawariya.How does this all bode with MNIK?MNIK is the story of Rizvaan Khan who suffers from Aspergers and has the inability to deal with social situations and interactions. He migrates to America after his brother sponsors him and starts working as a cosmetics salesman. He meets Kajol, a single mother who works in a salon and falls in love. His brother protests his decision to marry her but they do and start a small business together. Their domestic bliss is interrupted until 9/11. Life takes a tragic turn and Mandira accuses Rizvan and his faith for the tragedy. They separate and Rizvaan embarks on a journey that will bring back Mandira and clear conceptions about his name and religion.The movie showcases the finest talents India has to offer and Shahrukh delivers his best performance to date in recent years after Chak De. Any doubts that one had about his acting ability are permanently erased. Acting as a person with Autism, he is simply superb and has all the gestures and mannerisms to a T, I know this because I work with Autistic children. His acting makes you smile, watch the scene when Kajol asks him to marry him or the scene when he is interrogated at the airport. In fact in every scene there is a nuance that deserves a second viewing. Hopefully we will be able to see more of Rizvaan and less of Raj in the future.I cannot wait for the DVD to see the brilliant scenes individually.Kajol is simply superb, and makes a grand re entry. She plays the role of the supporting wife, and devasted mother with deftness. The chemistry of Shahrukh and Kajol is simply electric.Karan Johar's direction and Shibhani Bhatija's script is marvelous. Ravi Chandrans cinematography captures the American landscape remarkably well. Shankar - Ehsaan and Loy have complemented the movie with great music. My personal favorites are Sajdaa and Noor E Khuda. The only drawback that I can find would be Deepa Bhatia's editing, the second half could have been a little shorter and less preachy because it attempts to make Rizvaan in to a some sort of an icon.On the whole, My name is Khan is a great movie. I give it four stars because in my opinion the first half deserves 5 stars while the second half deserves 3 because things get a bit lengthy. Watch this movie now. Four stars 12/18/10Post Script: If you have seen the movie and found it too long, the American version is being readied for release and it is supposedly about 35 minutes shorter. Dharma Productions have recruited the services of Alan Edward Bell, director of 500 Days of Summer and will be released on the 7th of May with subtitles and voiceovers in English.",4,"Goodbye Raj, Hello Rizvan",1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,3525,"['Humungous', 'expectations', 'have', 'preceded', 'movie', 'one', 'biggest', 'stars', 'Indian', 'Film', 'Industry', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'who', 'thus', 'far', 'given', 'two', 'flops', 'i.e', 'Billu', 'Barber', 'Dulha', 'Mil', 'Gaya', 'were', 'not', 'considered', 'be', 'noteworthy', 'begin', 'with.Karan', 'Johar', 'who', 'began', 'career', 'Kuch', 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai', 'started', 'venture', 'serious', 'cinema', 'territory', 'Kabhi', 'Alvida', 'Na', 'Kehna', 'also', 'tried', 'maintain', 'stance', 'production', 'house', 'producing', 'diverse', 'fares', 'such', 'Dostana', 'Wake', 'up', 'Sid.Even', 'release', 'movie', 'was', 'hot', 'water', 'Shiv', 'Sena', 'right', 'wing', 'party', 'prevented', 'release', 'statements', 'made', 'Shahrukh', 'Pakistani', 'cricket', 'players.The', 'foray', 'Fox', 'Search', 'Light', 'pictures', 'Bollywood', 'payment', 'obscene', 'amount', 'rupees', 'rights', 'hope', 'have', 'successful', 'launch', 'where', 'Sony', 'stumbled', 'Saawariya.How', 'bode', 'MNIK', 'MNIK', 'story', 'Rizvaan', 'Khan', 'who', 'Aspergers', 'inability', 'deal', 'social', 'situations', 'interactions', 'America', 'brother', 'sponsors', 'working', 'cosmetics', 'salesman', 'Kajol', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'salon', 'love', 'brother', 'decision', 'marry', 'do', 'start', 'small', 'business', 'together', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'interrupted', '9/11', 'Life', 'tragic', 'turn', 'Mandira', 'Rizvan', 'faith', 'tragedy', 'separate', 'Rizvaan', 'embarks', 'journey', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'Mandira', 'clear', 'conceptions', 'name', 'religion.The', 'movie', 'finest', 'talents', 'India', 'offer', 'Shahrukh', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'recent', 'years', 'Chak', 'De', 'Any', 'doubts', 'one', 'had', 'acting', 'ability', 'are', 'permanently', 'erased', 'Acting', 'person', 'Autism', 'simply', 'superb', 'gestures', 'mannerisms', 'T', 'know', 'work', 'Autistic', 'children', 'acting', 'smile', 'watch', 'scene', 'when', 'Kajol', 'marry', 'scene', 'when', 'interrogated', 'airport', 'fact', 'scene', 'nuance', 'second', 'viewing', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'more', 'Rizvaan', 'less', 'Raj', 'future.I', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'DVD', 'see', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'individually.Kajol', 'simply', 'superb', 'grand', 're', 'entry', 'role', 'supporting', 'wife', 'devasted', 'mother', 'deftness', 'chemistry', 'Shahrukh', 'Kajol', 'simply', 'electric.Karan', 'Johar', 'direction', 'Shibhani', 'Bhatija', 'script', 'marvelous', 'Ravi', 'Chandrans', 'cinematography', 'American', 'landscape', 'remarkably', 'well', 'Shankar', 'Ehsaan', 'Loy', 'have', 'complemented', 'movie', 'great', 'music', 'personal', 'favorites', 'are', 'Sajdaa', 'Noor', 'E', 'Khuda', 'only', 'drawback', 'can', 'find', 'would', 'be', 'Deepa', 'Bhatia', 'editing', 'second', 'half', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'shorter', 'less', 'preachy', 'make', 'Rizvaan', 'sort', 'icon.On', 'whole', 'My', 'name', 'Khan', 'great', 'movie', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'because', 'opinion', 'first', 'half', '5', 'stars', 'second', 'half', '3', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'lengthy', 'Watch', 'movie', 'now', 'Four', 'stars', '12/18/10Post', 'Script', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'found', 'too', 'long', 'American', 'version', 'being', 'readied', 'release', 'supposedly', '35', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'Dharma', 'Productions', 'have', 'recruited', 'services', 'Alan', 'Edward', 'Bell', 'director', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'will', 'be', 'released', '7th', 'May', 'subtitles', 'voiceovers', 'English']",My Name Is Khan New Shahrukh - Kajol Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema

1347877,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B003K02EV0,Brian E. Erland,"[4, 4]","The film `My Name Is Khan' is a drama, inspirational love story and contemporary social commentary dealing with the highly emotional subject of racial profiling and the current enmity and distrust between Muslims and America citizenry at large. Definitely not the usual fair for two of Bollywood's greatest stars, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who are better known for dancing and singing their way into the hearts of their millions of fans worldwide. However the magic that occurs in front of the camera whenever these two come together is just as noticeable in `My Name Is Khan' as it is in any of their other many memorable collaborations.Anyone familiar with Hindi cinema has long come to the realization that there is a vast cultural difference in the understanding of the nature of time between East and West. While the American filmmaker is known to be rather terse with the amount of time to be spent on plot development, Indian filmmakers relish in the thought of drawing out every subtle nuance available to them. This film is no exception to the rule, running 2 hours and 45 minutes long it will surely be a chore for many and unfortunately there is a rather lengthy period in the middle of the movie that is excruciatingly slow which will cause many viewers to lose focus and interest. However for those with the stamina to stick it out they will be rewarded. In the last hour everything starts to fall into place, the action speeds up and an emotional angst begins to build that will really draw you in. I think when the final credits finally roll by you'll be happy that you invested the time and effort to persevere to the end.",4,"""Good People, Bad People"" ~ Discerning The Enemy Amongst Us",1281657600,"08 13, 2010",2010,1638,"['film', 'Name', 'Is', 'Khan', 'drama', 'inspirational', 'love', 'story', 'contemporary', 'social', 'commentary', 'dealing', 'highly', 'emotional', 'subject', 'racial', 'profiling', 'current', 'enmity', 'distrust', 'Muslims', 'America', 'citizenry', 'large', 'Definitely', 'not', 'usual', 'fair', 'two', 'Bollywood', 'greatest', 'stars', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'Kajol', 'who', 'are', 'better', 'known', 'dancing', 'singing', 'way', 'hearts', 'millions', 'fans', 'worldwide', 'However', 'magic', 'front', 'camera', 'whenever', 'two', 'come', 'together', 'just', 'noticeable', 'Name', 'Is', 'Khan', 'other', 'many', 'memorable', 'collaborations.Anyone', 'familiar', 'Hindi', 'cinema', 'long', 'come', 'realization', 'vast', 'cultural', 'difference', 'understanding', 'nature', 'time', 'East', 'West', 'American', 'filmmaker', 'known', 'be', 'rather', 'terse', 'amount', 'time', 'be', 'spent', 'plot', 'development', 'Indian', 'filmmakers', 'relish', 'thought', 'drawing', 'out', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'available', 'film', 'exception', 'rule', 'running', '2', 'hours', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'chore', 'many', 'unfortunately', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'period', 'middle', 'movie', 'excruciatingly', 'slow', 'will', 'cause', 'many', 'viewers', 'lose', 'focus', 'interest', 'However', 'stamina', 'stick', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'last', 'hour', 'everything', 'fall', 'place', 'action', 'up', 'emotional', 'angst', 'build', 'will', 'really', 'draw', 'think', 'when', 'final', 'credits', 'finally', 'roll', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'invested', 'time', 'effort', 'persevere', 'end']",My Name Is Khan New Shahrukh - Kajol Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema
1347878,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B003K02EV0,Caleb Williams,"[45, 48]","I'd been wanting to see this or a while and only managed to get the chance tonight. I was expecting a lot, as the trailer made it seem inspirational, and recommendations from friends only enforced that expectation. I have to say that not only were my expectations met, but they were surpassed. It is a truly beautiful film in every possible way. The story it has to tell, the way it is shot, the actors and their characters, the overall feel of the film is just absolutely stunning. I was taken on a rollercoaster ride of emotion as one moment I would be laughing my head off, and the next I'd be literally in tears. This film is not just here to entertain and make money (although I'm hoping it does a lot of both), but it sends out a very important and poignant message about the image of Islam in the world since the shocking and terrible events of 9/11. Not just Islam, but it sends out a message about all religion with the use of a very simple statement; ""Good people who do good deeds. Bad People who do bad. There is no other difference"". Such a strong message to send and it says something so simple. We're all human and regardless of the religion we live by or the culture we have, our deeds are what make us good or bad people and not those labels applied by those other parts of our lives.The story follows the journey of Rizwan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan), a Muslim man with Asperger's Syndrome as he writes a letter to his wife Mandira (Kajol) while he is on a journey to give the President of the United States a message; ""My Name Is Khan, and I am not a Terrorist"". Through this letter he is writing, we come to learn about the emotions he truly feels and can't express when speaking due to his condition. We learn about his upbringing with his brother Zakir and his Mother in Mumbai, his arrival in America to work with his brother and his eventual falling in love with the woman who would be his wife, Mandira. Rizwan achieves the impossible. He has made a happy life for himself in America and kept a promise he made to his Ammi. This happiness is not to last, however, as the tragedy of 9/11 occurs turning Riwan and Mandira's life upside down in very frightening and tragic ways. The stereotyping of the Muslim terrorist begins to make its mark on the couple and put a strain on their relationship but, one day things hit rock bottom and their son, Sameer (Yuvaan Makaar) is killed in a racially motivated attack. This is the final straw and the relationship breaks apart and Rizwan is told to leave and in the heat of the moment, only to return when he has given the message to the US President.Out of my little description, I've missed out so much. There's a lot to take in from this film and something that you will enjoy as the film runs. Shah Rukh Khan deserves a very prestigious western award for his role in this film. Possibly even going as high up as an Oscar (although I'm sure there's some rule that would prevent that from ever happening) as his performance is magnificent and he is truly deserving of wider recognition in the western world. He steals the show as the personality and mannerisms of the character are maintained beautifully throughout, from the twitching of the neck to simply the way he speaks. There are times when his traits are hilarious, and others when they are frankly annoying. But you never lose sight of the genuine and caring nature of this character and you become adoring of his flaws as they simply vale what is a very sweet personality.This, in a sense, gives you more of a respectful understanding of the condition and how difficult it may be to cope with, especially in social circumstances, when you want to say something, but simply cannot express it the way you want. The message of everyone being simply being defined as being part of one of two groups, good or bad people, is one that I truly admire and taking on the topic of religion during such a raw and emotional time, and offering it from the perspective of an Asian family is a very brave and meaningful move.A beautiful film with a beautiful message, and by far the best film I've ever had the pleasure of watching.",5,A Genuine Emotional Masterpiece,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,4138,"[""'d"", 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'while', 'only', 'managed', 'get', 'chance', 'tonight', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'trailer', 'made', 'inspirational', 'recommendations', 'friends', 'only', 'enforced', 'expectation', 'have', 'say', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'expectations', 'met', 'were', 'surpassed', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'possible', 'way', 'story', 'tell', 'way', 'shot', 'actors', 'characters', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'just', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'was', 'taken', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'emotion', 'one', 'moment', 'would', 'be', 'laughing', 'head', 'next', ""'d"", 'be', 'literally', 'tears', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'here', 'entertain', 'make', 'money', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'lot', 'out', 'very', 'important', 'poignant', 'message', 'image', 'Islam', 'world', 'shocking', 'terrible', 'events', '9/11', 'Not', 'just', 'Islam', 'out', 'message', 'religion', 'use', 'very', 'simple', 'statement', 'Good', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'good', 'deeds', 'Bad', 'People', 'who', 'do', 'bad', 'other', 'difference', 'strong', 'message', 'send', 'something', 'so', 'simple', ""'re"", 'human', 'regardless', 'religion', 'live', 'culture', 'have', 'deeds', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'good', 'bad', 'people', 'not', 'labels', 'applied', 'other', 'parts', 'lives.The', 'story', 'journey', 'Rizwan', 'Khan', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'Muslim', 'man', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'letter', 'wife', 'Mandira', 'Kajol', 'journey', 'give', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'message', 'Name', 'Is', 'Khan', 'am', 'not', 'Terrorist', 'letter', 'writing', 'come', 'learn', 'emotions', 'truly', 'feels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'when', 'speaking', 'due', 'condition', 'learn', 'upbringing', 'brother', 'Zakir', 'Mother', 'Mumbai', 'arrival', 'America', 'work', 'brother', 'eventual', 'falling', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'wife', 'Mandira', 'Rizwan', 'impossible', 'made', 'happy', 'life', 'America', 'kept', 'promise', 'made', 'Ammi', 'happiness', 'not', 'last', 'however', 'tragedy', '9/11', 'occurs', 'turning', 'Riwan', 'Mandira', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'very', 'frightening', 'tragic', 'ways', 'stereotyping', 'Muslim', 'terrorist', 'make', 'mark', 'couple', 'put', 'strain', 'relationship', 'one', 'day', 'things', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'son', 'Sameer', 'Yuvaan', 'Makaar', 'killed', 'racially', 'motivated', 'attack', 'final', 'straw', 'relationship', 'breaks', 'apart', 'Rizwan', 'told', 'leave', 'heat', 'moment', 'only', 'return', 'when', 'given', 'message', 'US', 'President.Out', 'little', 'description', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'lot', 'take', 'film', 'something', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'very', 'prestigious', 'western', 'award', 'role', 'film', 'Possibly', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'high', 'up', 'Oscar', ""'m"", 'sure', 'rule', 'would', 'prevent', 'ever', 'happening', 'performance', 'magnificent', 'truly', 'deserving', 'wider', 'recognition', 'western', 'world', 'show', 'personality', 'mannerisms', 'character', 'are', 'maintained', 'beautifully', 'twitching', 'neck', 'simply', 'way', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'traits', 'are', 'hilarious', 'others', 'when', 'are', 'frankly', 'annoying', 'never', 'lose', 'sight', 'genuine', 'caring', 'nature', 'character', 'become', 'adoring', 'flaws', 'simply', 'vale', 'what', 'very', 'sweet', 'personality.This', 'sense', 'more', 'respectful', 'understanding', 'condition', 'how', 'difficult', 'may', 'be', 'cope', 'especially', 'social', 'circumstances', 'when', 'want', 'say', 'something', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'way', 'want', 'message', 'everyone', 'being', 'simply', 'being', 'defined', 'being', 'part', 'one', 'two', 'groups', 'good', 'bad', 'people', 'one', 'truly', 'admire', 'taking', 'topic', 'religion', 'raw', 'emotional', 'time', 'offering', 'perspective', 'Asian', 'family', 'very', 'brave', 'meaningful', 'move.A', 'beautiful', 'film', 'beautiful', 'message', 'far', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching']",My Name Is Khan New Shahrukh - Kajol Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema

This syndrome affects the way that he relates to the world and those around him. On the positive side, he can solve word puzzles and remember large portions of texts, word for word easily.On the negative side, this syndrome causes him to get confused easily and he repeats certain phases continually, which can cause persons to misunderstand him.

1347897,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003K02EV0,Grady Harp,"[6, 8]","MY NAME IS KHAN is a rather long journey of a film - almost as long the journey depicted in the movie.  At three hours in length it may lose some viewers, but for those who stay until the end, the message is larger than life and very important.  Especially now, as the world grapples with multiple wars based on differences of beliefs under the flag of 'religion'.  As written by Shibani Bathija and Nirajan Iyengar this is a tale of growing to understand and embrace tolerance on many levels.  The main character, Khan, in many ways represents Everyman - a human being, imperfect in the eyes of the world because he has Asperger's Syndrome, who discovers the meaning of love and the importance of tolerance so necessary if this world is to stay intact.We first meet Rizwan Khan, an outsider because of his variations from normal due to his Asperger's Syndrome, living with his Muslim mother Razia (Zarina Wahab) and younger brother Zakir: Zakir is gifted and at age 18 leaves Mumbai to move to  San Francisco for a new beginning. When Razia dies she makes Khan promise her that he will make a good life - that there are no differences in people except good and bad.  Khan (Shahrukh Khan) moves to San Francisco, coping with his disabilities as best he can, finds work with in a cosmetic firm selling lotions and potions for his brother Zakir (Jimmy Shergill).  One of the reasons Khan is successful as a salesman is his utter honesty, and this trait finds an admirer in cosmetologist Mendira (Kajol) who eventually, through a courtship that is as special as any ever filmed, agrees to marry Khan.  Zakir condemns the marriage (Mendira is Hindu, Khan Muslim) and will not accept the couple in his and his wife Hasina's (Sonya Jehan) home. Mendira has a young son from a former marriage and that son finds friendship that eventually betrays him: the world of the Bay Area is sick with the aftermath of 9/11 and all Muslims are suspect and disrespected.  When Mendira's son is brutally beaten to death, the Hindu Mendira blames herself for marrying a Muslim Khan, and tells his to leave, that the only way she will ever see him again is after he has met with the President of the US to say 'My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.'Mendira stays in her home struggling with the fact that her son's murderers cannot be found.  Khan sets out to travel across the country, attempting to meet the President and deliver his message so that Mendira will take him back. His journey is an examination of human kindness - he is supported by an African American Georgia family Mama Jenny (Jennifer Echols) when he helps her son, and in turn when a hurricane destroys Mama Jenny's home, Khan returns to help her rebuild, an act that is televised and encourages many Muslims (including Zakir and Hasina) to offer help in the catastrophe.  There are many other sidebar stories that occur during Khan's mission to greet the President, each an example of how important communication and equality is life we are to dwell on one planet.  Yes, the ending is somewhat saccharine, but the eyes won't likely remain dry as the credits roll.Sharukh Khan is extraordinary as Khan and the supporting cast is very strong, especially the beautiful and talented Kajol.

1347898,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,B003K02EV0,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[1, 2]","The writeup on the cover is somewhat misleading. This movie is about tolerance and intolerance, both between faiths and cultures and within those faiths (well, within Islam). No one is spared - Muslims, Christians, Hindus - but the treatment is also balanced. It's a feel-good movie, but there's also a dose of tragedy, from 9/11 and its results.Khan is a moderate Muslim with Asperger's Syndrome. He's a genius at repairing things, but is frightened of loud sounds and the color yellow, and has trouble expressing his feelings, although he can fall in love.The movie is structured so that we find out gradually why he's on his trip across America. This was well done, and keeps us waiting to find out more. We are shown his childhood and how his condition affects him. He takes things literally, always tells the truth, and has a seemingly eidetic memory, and this is a source of humor throughout the movie.He falls for a Hindu woman and, to the chagrin of his ""more devout"" brother, marries her. But he is no less devout, carrying out his required prayer times no matter where he happens to be. He has been taught by his mother that there are only two kinds of people - those who do good, and those who do evil. This is how he sees the world.We are shown the tragic consequences of 9/11, leading to suspicion and hatred towards Muslims. This was a bit heavy-handed, as the reality in the States was very different from what would be expected in the rest of the world, considering the video of Muslim children laughing and cheering the death and destruction of 9/11, an image of demented hatred. For example, the movie only shows the resulting bigotry, but not the concerted efforts throughout the country to show kindness and acceptance to Muslims post-9/11, even towns neighborhoods offering free meals to them. There is a call for moderate Muslims to be proud of their faith, showing educated women once again proud to wear their hijab. And there is a call to root out the jihadist elements from within Islam.In the movie, their business falters because of the Khan name attached to it. I cannot speak for Muslims who may have experienced this, but it seemed to me fictional, since I would not have guessed that ""Khan"" was a Muslim name, nor would I have expected most Americans to.At some point Khan is arrested, and supposedly tortured (with alternating heat and cold). This is may or not be true. Our rules don't even allow for shouting at detainees, or playing rock music, so offhand I would judge this as fictional, as some movies falsely portray Gitmo (e.g. Harold and Kumar), but I can take this either way, as he's not treated as badly as regular prisoners would be treated in European prisons.At the end of the movie, a wise fool finally meets an educated fool, althought the irony of this may be lost on most viewers.All in all, an uplifting movie, albeit centered in his personal tragedy. It's funny and sad and inspirational and worth discussing.",4,Feel-good and feel-bad movie,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,2962,"['writeup', 'cover', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'movie', 'tolerance', 'intolerance', 'faiths', 'cultures', 'faiths', 'well', 'Islam', 'one', 'spared', 'Muslims', 'Christians', 'Hindus', 'treatment', 'also', 'balanced', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'also', 'dose', 'tragedy', '9/11', 'results.Khan', 'moderate', 'Muslim', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'genius', 'repairing', 'things', 'frightened', 'loud', 'sounds', 'color', 'yellow', 'trouble', 'expressing', 'feelings', 'can', 'fall', 'love.The', 'movie', 'structured', 'so', 'find', 'out', 'gradually', 'why', 'trip', 'America', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'waiting', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'are', 'shown', 'childhood', 'how', 'condition', 'things', 'literally', 'always', 'truth', 'seemingly', 'eidetic', 'memory', 'source', 'humor', 'movie.He', 'Hindu', 'woman', 'chagrin', 'more', 'devout', 'brother', 'less', 'devout', 'carrying', 'out', 'required', 'prayer', 'matter', 'where', 'be', 'been', 'taught', 'mother', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'kinds', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'good', 'who', 'do', 'evil', 'how', 'world.We', 'are', 'shown', 'tragic', 'consequences', '9/11', 'leading', 'suspicion', 'hatred', 'towards', 'Muslims', 'was', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'reality', 'States', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'rest', 'world', 'considering', 'video', 'Muslim', 'children', 'laughing', 'cheering', 'death', 'destruction', '9/11', 'image', 'demented', 'hatred', 'example', 'movie', 'only', 'resulting', 'bigotry', 'not', 'concerted', 'efforts', 'country', 'show', 'kindness', 'acceptance', 'Muslims', 'post-9/11', 'even', 'towns', 'neighborhoods', 'offering', 'free', 'meals', 'call', 'moderate', 'Muslims', 'be', 'proud', 'faith', 'showing', 'educated', 'women', 'once', 'again', 'proud', 'wear', 'hijab', 'call', 'root', 'out', 'jihadist', 'elements', 'Islam.In', 'movie', 'business', 'falters', 'Khan', 'name', 'attached', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'Muslims', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'experienced', 'seemed', 'fictional', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'guessed', 'Khan', 'was', 'Muslim', 'name', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'most', 'Americans', 'to.At', 'point', 'Khan', 'arrested', 'supposedly', 'tortured', 'alternating', 'heat', 'cold', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'rules', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'allow', 'shouting', 'detainees', 'playing', 'rock', 'music', 'offhand', 'would', 'judge', 'fictional', 'movies', 'falsely', 'portray', 'Gitmo', 'e.g', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'can', 'take', 'way', 'not', 'treated', 'as', 'badly', 'regular', 'prisoners', 'would', 'be', 'treated', 'European', 'prisons.At', 'end', 'movie', 'wise', 'fool', 'finally', 'educated', 'fool', 'althought', 'irony', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'most', 'viewers.All', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'albeit', 'centered', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'funny', 'sad', 'inspirational', 'worth', 'discussing']",My Name Is Khan New Shahrukh - Kajol Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema
1347899,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003K02EV0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 6]","What, Kajol and Shah Rukh together again on cinema after nearly ten years? And Karan Johar again directing them? O happy day. Okay, I did fleetingly think - when I first eyeballed the movie's title - that, oboy, Shah Rukh Khan had finally let his ego get to him. But, it turns out, this title MY NAME IS KHAN is quite relevant to the story. I think that Shah Rukh is a hell of an actor, except he'd always been hampered (and pigeonholed) with those showy romantic lead roles. So it's real nice that, in the past few years, as he's gotten older, he's begun to stretch himself (SWADES, CHAK DE INDIA!, RAB NE BANA DI JODI). And Kajol is Kajol. Whereas Shah Rukh's instincts lean toward flashiness and the expansive gesture, Kajol gets a lot of stuff done with her more minimal, more unaffected performance. Of course, you get drawn to that irresistible spirit of hers, and those stormy eyes.Shah Rukh plays Rizvan Khan, a Muslim Indian with a knack for fixing broken objects. Rizvan is afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome, thus rendering him a highly functional autistic. He's easily discomfited by sharp sounds and by the color yellow, and forget about eye contact. Sponsored by his brother, Rizvan makes a new life in San Francisco and begins working for his brother's company, selling his Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products (the pamphlet boasts that women using these products will ""shine like a newly wedded bride""). Given his condition, Rizvan is often frightened, and peace of mind doesn't truly arrive until he meets Mandira (Kajol), a lovely, effervescent single mother. He hawks his wares to her; they become friends. It's a start.It should be noted that Kajol has never required Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products to glow like a newly wedded bride.That legendary spark between them is still there, still effortless and considerable. Whenever it's just Shah Rukh and Kajol interacting, the movie is really good. Both actors are marvelous in constructing their slow burn relationship, and it's key that you buy into their romance, especially in Rizvan's affection for Mandira. It's his love for her, after all, which drives the plot and which continually urges him on in his monumental journey. I don't know how true to life SRK's performance is of someone with Asperger's Syndrome, but you instantly sympathize with Rizvan even as you acclimate to his quirky, jarring mannerisms.Where the film falters at times is when it tries to get on message. No rhapsodic singing and dancing in this one. Director Karan Johar is trying for something else here. In its production values and technical execution, MY NAME IS KHAN is very polished. And yet it can't quite get away from all the Bollywood tropes. The story has things to impart concerning religious differences and racial intolerance (and profiling) in a post-9/11 climate. Except that sometimes, as scenes play out, the message is delivered in a heavyhanded or overwrought fashion. Note the really cringe-worthy sequence in Georgia when Rizvan first meets ""Mama Jenny"" and ""Funny Hair Joel."" The film also suggests that there are only two kinds of people: good people and bad people. That is a hell of an oversimplification. Life inhabits plenty of gray areas. Another thing that bugged me is would Rizvan's brother really have deployed his autistic brother out in the streets by himself to sell products? That is a seriously callous move.Rizvan wins Mandira, but then loses her. To win her back, he embarks on a cross-country odyssey which gains prominence in the film's second half. Rizvan's journey is fraught with effective sequences but also with moments that oversell themselves. I love that SRK and Kajol have reunited, and I'm happy that that magical rapport is still present (and it must suck to be Ajay Devgan whenever his wife Kajol and SRK have a movie out). Only, a bit more restraint on the director's part would have done wonders. Still, flaws and all, I recommend this film. It's got a good heart and is worth at least 3.5 out of 5 stars.The DVD extras: ""Changing the Face of Bollywood"" has director Karan Johar and SRK reflecting on the globalization of Indian cinema (00:04:47 minutes long); ""Working Together"" explores that heady chemistry between SRK and Kajol and how they are viewed as THE romantic film couple by Indian cinema-goers (00:04:38); ""The Music Of MY NAME IS KHAN"" - how the songs were carefully selected for soulfulness and spirituality - no flashy item numbers, please (00:02:48); ""The Story of MY NAME IS KHAN"" focuses on the film's story premise, that of one simple, innocent man changing the perceptions of those around him (00:06:03); the ""Sajda"" music promo (00:01:32) and the ""Tee Naina"" music promo (00:01:32).",4,"""I may look a little strange to you, but that's because I have Asperger's Syndrome...

1347904,AWM5W0MZYXF29,B003K02EV0,Kevin O'Conner,"[0, 0]","Enough of the previous reviews here have discussed the plot of My Name is Khan, so I won't rehash it here.I'm not a fan of Bollywood movies, but my interest in My Name is Khan (a movie I had never heard of before) was piqued by an article I recently read about Shah Rukh Khan following his recent detainment while entering the US. Rather than the usual garish musical spectacle, it sounded as though My Name is Khan would be a serious film that explored some important issues of relevance in post-9/11 America.Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was that the protagonist of My Name is Khan is a man with Asperger Syndrome, a form of autism. This was something the article I'd read failed to mention, giving his statement ""My name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist"" quite a different context than if it were coming from a ""normal"" person. That is, it became less of a political statement, and more of the kind of obsessive attention to a subject that is frequently cited as one of the signs of Asperger's.Oddly enough, watching this film illuminated for me some of the conceits of Hollywood films through its own conceits. For example, some of the portrayals of Americans in My Name is Khan are rather stereotypical; then again, Hollywood has portrayed people from other parts of the world through stereotypes for decades. Another example is the television news graphics, particularly the ones connected with the election of President Obama, whose name is strictly avoided; thus, we get the oddly worded ""First African American President"" on-screen graphics, which I never saw on any actual broadcast during the election. The inauthenticity of this actually took me out of my suspension of disbelief--as did the depiction of the fictional town of Wilhelmina, Georgia, which looks like no American town I've ever seen. Here again, the television news graphics depicted, with their references to ""Georgia State"", briefly took me out of my suspension of disbelief. And, let us not forget the absurdity of any group of Americans having no problem whatsoever understanding a speaker who is speaking primarily in Hindi--which is really not so absurd when you think of any number of Hollywood movies in which Europeans converse entirely in English, albeit sometimes with accents.Those distractions aside, I found My Name is Khan to be a surprisingly moving story. Despite my best efforts, I became teary-eyed in a few spots towards the end of the movie, something which rarely happens when I watch movies.Some have complained that My Name is Khan is ""preachy"" and ""self-serving"", and one review on Amazon actually (if improbably) reduces it to ""feel-good leftist pro-Muslim anti-American pro-Obama anti-Bush Bollywood propaganda that successfully rivals 1930-s Soviet state propaganda films.[sic]"" Granted, in many ways, the movie is a bit simplistic. But, in that respect, it is no less offensive than many Hollywood movies that have been less than subtle in trying to convey messages. (Actually, the comparison made in another review to Forrest Gump is probably more appropriate.)At the same time, though, the movie does not exempt its own characters from examination. Witness Khan's brother's objection to his marriage on the basis that his bride-to-be is not Muslim, which echoes the Hindu-Muslim tensions witnessed during the brothers' youth; or his wife's emotionally fraught conclusion that the tragedy which has befallen them is because of her husband's Muslim name. Though perhaps not as obvious to American sensibilities, it's clear that the makers of this movie aren't limiting their awareness of prejudice and intolerance to Americans.It is worth mentioning briefly that the casting of CNN commentator Fareed Zakaria as a radical Muslim cleric is a nice bit of casting against type. And Zakaria does surprisingly well as portraying the anger of the character.At its heart, though, My Name is Khan is a love story. The main character's narrative consists of letters he writes to his wife as he makes is way around the US in hopes of meeting the president so he can tell him that ""my name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist."" This journey, of course, is the one he has undertaken in hopes that his wife will take him back after the tragedy that has torn them apart.I really have only two criticisms of this movie. One is the Wilhelmina, Georgia subplot. Though I understand how it fits into the movie, it often feels like a gratuitous diversion. The other is that it's probably 30 minutes too long. Particularly during the Wilhelmina sequences, I found my attention starting to wander.But, overall, I found My Name is Khan to be quite good.

The performances by Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are stellar and if there is any justice the film should at least receive an Oscar nod as Best Foreign Film.But I want to touch upon the notion that several reviewers have mentioned that the scenes in Georgia were unnecessary.  I disagree.  Those scenes were there to emphasize that Rizwan completely adhered to the lesson that his mother taught him that there were only two kinds of people in the world; good and bad.  To the point of setting his own personal journey aside, he felt to need to help ""good"" people that were in trouble.  How could we capture that notion any better than having him come to the aid of another group of people that were be subjected to the discrimination that he was feeling?Is some of it over the top and/or unrealistic?  No more than the action film characters that survive exploding cars and jumps from rooftops with little or no harm to their bodies.  It's a movie, people.All films paint certain characters with broad strokes to move the story along.  Most of those stereotypical characters are based on some exaggeration of the truth.  I am an African American woman who like Mama Jenny is a ""little fat"".  I was not offended by anything in the movie at all.  She was portrayed as a caring and warm person.  And anyone that thinks that areas like that don't exist in American anymore have not traveled off of the main roads.  People are forgetting that the main character has Asperger's.  His description of Joel and his hair is something an autistic person may say.  My nephew is autistic.  He is very literal with observations. He doesn't think about the political correctness of his statement before he speaks. But again, it is a movie, people.My only complaint would be the one I have with all Hindi movies that portray Americans.  I can always tell that they are British actors.  There were two actors I immediately recognized from US TV shows; Tonya Lee Williams as the African American newscaster and Christopher B. Duncan as President Obama.  But Tonya is actually British too.  The actress playing Mama Jenny, Jennifer Echols, has made many appearances on TV; Dexter, ER, The Shield, Nip/Tuck, My Name is Earl, etc.  And the kid playing Joel, Adrian Kali Turner, has been on Chuck, Numb3rs, Flashforward and iCarly.

1347918,A1N8BYCY361NIJ,B003K02EV0,"N. Joseph ""NE--Joseph""","[4, 6]","I had high expectations for this film and I must say it didn't disappoint. It's not your average Bollywood song and dance family melodrama that we have come to expect from Karan Johar but he does a very nice job of putting into context the animosity and discrimination directed towards Muslims post-911. Shah Rukh Khan does a good job of playing his character. I am not familiar with Asperger Syndrome so I am not sure how people would act or react to others and situations given their circumstances. So I wonder if SRK went over the top as usual? I was disappointed with Kajol's performance. She too over plays her characters and comes off looking and sounding annoying. They make a good on screen couple but I think she is way overrated as a Bollywood actress. I like her when she is subdued. Her voice irritates me when she gets excited (which is most of the time in most of her films) but she improved slightly closer to the end of the film. I think one of her better roles was in the movie, Fanaa with Amir Khan. But as far as My Name is Khan goes, kudos to Mr. Johar for approaching this timely topic with a great deal of sensitivity and heart.

1347919,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003K02EV0,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","&lt;strong>My Name Is Khan&lt;/strong> (Karan Johar, 2010)I have terrifying, terrifying images in my head of Hollywood attempting to remake &lt;em>My Name Is Khan&lt;/em>. First off, the Bollywood original runs two hours and forty-one minutes. This would be untenable in any culture in which Harvey ""ninety minutes and out"" Weinstein is a player, so of course we'd lose a few subplots. (We might actually lose the main plot. I've seen a couple of Asian-horror-film remakes that came bloody close to losing the main plot.) But imagine all the time you could save by doing what Hollywood does best: emotional shortcuts.If you've read my movie reviews for any length of time, you've heard me going off about Hollywood's use of emotional shortcuts, which has by this time gotten so endemic that I can't remember the last mainstream Hollywood-studio-distributed movie I saw that didn't contain them as a substitute for real characterization. (This is why today's monthly update of my thousand-best-films-ever list's twelve changes--including &lt;em>My Name Is Khan&lt;/em>, which entered the list at #160--saw eight foreign films, three American movies made well outside the Hollywood machine, and one pre-emotional-shortcut Hollywood film enter the list, and twelve modern mainstream Hollywood films leave it.) Let me give you a quick example of what I'm talking about here. &lt;em>My Name Is Khan&lt;/em> contains a minor character named Abdul, who runs a store in San Francisco selling televisions. Once he's introduced, which doesn't happen until relatively late in the film, we see a number of scenes in which Abdul features, though he's never the center of the scene. As we progress, we get that Abdul, who in post-9/11 America is basically shunned for being a Muslim, is getting more and more frustrated with the world around him. Finally, in the first scene in which Abdul &lt;em>does&lt;/em> take center stage, he absolutely blows his top, storms out onto the street and starts accosting middle-class white folks, confronting them with his Muslim-ness. It's an absolutely hysterical scene, and it works because we've had time to get to know Abdul and his situation. Now, in a Hollywood remake, the ten minutes or so of collected Abdul scenes which are spread over about an hour of this flick would be conflated into a single scene--the one in which Khan himself stumbles by Abdul's shop and sees footage of a massive hurricane hitting the coast of Georgia (which, in the main plotline, sends Khan running back to Georgia to help some friends he has down there). Assuming Abdul was kept in the film at all, naturally, all the buildup of Abdul's frustration would be cut down to one customer's Meaningful Look(TM), probably a suspicious narrowing of the eyes, accompanied by a subtle ominous cue in the soundtrack. These two things will combine to tell you that Abdul is Suspicious (or, at least, considered so by everyone else in the movie). And yes, as the incredible success of hundreds of mainstream American movies every year will tell you, the emotional shortcut method DOES play in Des Moines, often to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues. But ask yourself the question: would you rather allow yourself to be manipulated by a narrowing of the eyes and a musical cue, or would it be preferable for you to be given more detail about Abdul and make up your own mind?If you prefer the latter, I cannot begin to recommend &lt;em>My Name Is Khan&lt;/em> enough. There are so many superlatives I want to use to describe this movie that I'm not sure where to begin, so I may as well start with the opening scene. I am a big, big advocate of using unknown actors in high-profile roles, because all too often, the meta--the stuff we know about a film star's off-camera life--tends to overwhelm the character. You can't look at Tom Cruise these days without thinking about him jumping on the couch, right? Well, the opening scene of this movie is a stunning exception. Shah Rukh Khan basically &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a Bollywood version of Tom Cruise, one of the Indian film industry's most famous, and recognizable, exports. And the first sequence of this movie is a horrifying ten-minute journey through the TSA (Transportation Safety Authority, for those of you outside the US--the people who have added two hours to your wait time at American airports) system at SFO as Rizvan Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan, natch; I'll try not to let the last-name confusion go any farther than this), a man with severe Asperger's Syndrome, is pulled out of line, herded into a small room, searched, and ridiculed. And the fact that this is one of Bollywood's biggest actors puts that seed in our heads: ""if this can happen to Shah Rukh Kahn, this can happen to &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em>"". It's a [censored for Amazon consumption] gamble, and it pays off in spades.But that wouldn't be enough to make this film as good as it is by itself, naturally; you've still got two and a half hours of movie after that, and while there are a number of other actors whose presence here must (and will) be noted, this movie is all Shah Rukh Khan. I grant you, the Asperger's suffered by Rizvan in this movie is extreme, and it's one of the few places where the movie exaggerates for effect. (I note this because the movie's otherwise restrained feel is very surprising in a big-budget Bollywood blockbuster; I was very pleasantly surprised.) But that said, once you get past the initial ""this is kind of exaggerated, here..."", and start digesting how well Khan is playing this part, the wow factor just plain soars. Even if the film had been nothing but a character sketch/road movie, which the end of that first sequence points to if you're used to Hollywood movies and their linear plots, Khan's performance alone would have propelled this into the stratosphere.It's not just a character sketch/road movie, though it is that. It is also a romantic drama (I can't think of the last Bollywood film I saw that didn't have a romance element to it), and here's where I can finally find a way to segue from superlatives into an actual plot synopsis: Rizvan Khan is originally in that little room because he has been charged by his wife, Mandira (&lt;em>Ishq&lt;/em>'s Kajol), with meeting President George W. Bush and delivering him the message: ""my name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist."" While we can guess at the broadest idea of why this is from the very moment he says it (Rizvan is a Muslim in post-9/11 America), the movie shuttles back and forth between Khan's often amusing journey, which takes place from late 2007 to early 2010, around the country trying to track down the president and deliver his message, to the past, from the early-eighties Hindu-Muslim riots in India, to the climactic event in 2007 that causes Mandira to charge him with the task at hand. In the process, Shibani Bathija's (&lt;em>Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&lt;/em>) script tackles a &lt;em>hell&lt;/em> of a lot of weighty issues. You'd think Asperger's Syndrome, 9/11, and the Hindu-Muslim riots would be enough. You'd be wrong. (I already mentioned the hurricane, and if you pay attention to those dates, you'll notice an historic presidential election in there as well.) Now, we've all seen any number of Hollywood films that tried to tackle a single one of those issues--9/11. And I don't know about you, but I haven't seen a single one that's gotten it right yet. (The closest of them was Spike Lee's impressionist take on ""we will rebuild"" in &lt;em>25th Hour&lt;/em>.) Perhaps it takes a sympathetic outsider's eye to examine such things? God knows we're still too close to it, thanks to still-unending media coverage. Bathija--who often teams with director Karan Johar--is one mean talent. That said, one of the places the movie does fail is in some of the English dialogue (especially in a hospital scene about two-thirds of the way through the film); having a native speaker take a quick look over the script, a larger portion of which is in English than is usual in Bollywood productions, to check such things as idiom would have been a really, really good idea here.Johar ain't so bad himself. He's either produced, directed, or both a string of Bollywood blockbusters over the past fifteen years (including &lt;em>Kal Ho Naa Ho&lt;/em>, another favorite of mine, and another film where SRK gives a fine performance) that any producer/director on this side of the pond would be proud to have under his belt. I think he may be slightly better as a producer than a director; at one hundred sixty-one minutes, this is actually on the short side for Bollywood, and there are still a few places, though they are rare, where the direction seems to lose its way for a minute or two and the pace slips. But they are few, and forgivable, especially to American eyes--which are generally unused to seeing a movie with this much energy applied for such an extended period of time.Okay, I've already gone on way too long about this movie (word count tells me I was at 1,513 at the end of the last paragraph) and I haven't even mentioned the strong supporting cast, which includes a number of solid American character actors you'll likely recognize (Katie Amanda Keane, Benny Nieves, and Kenton Duty all have meaty roles) as well as some bigger names in America (&lt;em>Deadgirl&lt;/em>'s Kathleen Darcy pops up in a small role, while the always-wonderful Jennifer Echols, who's been providing comic relief in Hollywood since &lt;em>Save the Last Dance&lt;/em>, gets what may be the largest role of her career). Nor a number of other facets of the film (the soundtrack plays more like that of an American film, rather than the cast breaking out into those big Bollywood dance numbers, which was a welcome surprise) that range from the notable to the praiseworthy. While the film does have a few flaws I mentioned above, it's still one of the best movies I've seen in years. Highly recommended. **** ",5,"Brave, uplifting, and an object lesson for Hollywood.",1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,9961,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'My', 'Name', 'Is', 'Khan', 'lt', '>', 'Karan', 'Johar',

After 9/11, San Francisco is depicted as a nest of seething, right-wing bigotry where Muslims are shunned at candlelight vigils and backyard barbecues, where well-groomed whites never miss an opportunity to taunt, bully, or beat a Muslim, where Muslim shops are vandalized and ransacked, and where angry Anglos tear burqas off of Muslim women.  This nightmare vision does not accurately portray any corner of America after 9/11, least of all San Francisco.2.  The scenes in Georgia will make you roll your eyes.

1347929,AIWA57W45A0AX,B003K02EV0,Victoria C. Wood,"[13, 15]","Whatever else is in the movie, THIS IS A LOVE STORY. Anyone who doesn't realize that has missed the entire point. A man living in turbulent times and circumstances, afflicted with a difficult handicap, goes to extraordinary lengths for the woman he cannot stop loving. All the rest is background, albeit entertaining background.While I found the different point of view (that of Muslims and Hindus in America) interesting and enlightening, no one should take the political and/or social aspects of this movie seriously other than to view them as educational. It's simply part of the setting. That's why no one attempted to DO them very seriously...because they were background to the plot, they were not the plot itself. This is not a failed front for a social/political documentary. It's an extraordinarily successful, beautiful, and sensitive love story.Ironically, though the movie is about Muslims and Hindus and not a mention is made of the Christian religion in the entire film (other than to show a couple of non-religious scenes in a church), there is a powerful Christian message (probably common to most religions): that love heals and hatred destroys, and that character and moral courage (not bravado) are what make real men.It's sad that no one has thought to praise the remarkable performance of Shahrukh Khan, who portrays a man afflicted with Aspberger's Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism. Khan is at a disadvantage: Had Dustin Hoffman never done Rainman, nor Leonardo DiCaprio given us his amazing performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Khan's portrayal of Risvan Khan might have been given the considerable respect it deserves. As it is, in my view he still excels the others in one respect: he manages to infuse charm, high intelligence, and even sexiness into his very convincing portrayal of a disability generally not thought of as very sexy.The charm and comedy of this movie are irresistible. The chemistry between the leading actors is legendary in India (they've made at least 5 movies together). The directing is flawless, the acting top-rate, the photography excellent, the music lively and compelling. One note about the music: it's ethnic (hence Indian), which means it's not what American audiences are used to hearing. But if you can get past the culture shock, you may do as I did and end up loving it enough to buy the CD.There is enough action to keep even my husband, who loves nothing more than to see buildings blowing up, interested. When asked if there are very many subtitles to read, I told my daughter there were some, but not enough to distract from the movie. Only when I watched it a second time did I realize there are subtitles throughout most of it (I was too absorbed to even realize I was reading subtitles most of the time. Hint: use the Pause button as needed). I was riveted throughout the entire movie and never found a single moment boring. In fact, I was surprised at how fast the time had gone. And when the movie was over, even my action-loving husband said, ""I'm not sure, but that may be the best movie I've ever seen.""For parents: This movie does not contain nudity, sex scenes (although the word ""sex"" is mentioned), nor does it contain anything crude. There is some violence, but it's not pervasive, nor is it graphic. And here's a wonderfully refreshing twist: the couple actually marries before sleeping together! My husband did think he heard the F word in one scene, but I've watched the movie twice and didn't hear it; so if it's in there, it's not obvious.",5,"If I Could Only Watch One Movie, This Would Be It",1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,3541,"['else', 'movie', 'THIS', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'Anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'realize', 'missed', 'entire', 'point', 'man', 'living', 'turbulent', 'times', 'circumstances', 'afflicted', 'difficult', 'handicap', 'extraordinary', 'lengths', 'woman', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'loving', 'rest', 'background', 'entertaining', 'background.While', 'found', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'Muslims', 'Hindus', 'America', 'interesting', 'enlightening', 'one', 'should', 'take', 'political', 'and/or', 'social', 'aspects', 'movie', 'seriously', 'other', 'view', 'educational', 'simply', 'part', 'setting', 'why', 'one', 'attempted', 'DO', 'very', 'seriously', 'were', 'background', 'plot', 'were', 'not', 'plot', 'not', 'failed', 'front', 'social/political', 'documentary', 'extraordinarily', 'successful', 'beautiful', 'sensitive', 'love', 'story.Ironically', 'movie', 'Muslims', 'Hindus', 'not', 'mention', 'made', 'Christian', 'religion', 'entire', 'film', 'other', 'show', 'couple', 'non-religious', 'scenes', 'church', 'powerful', 'Christian', 'message', 'probably', 'common', 'most', 'religions', 'love', 'heals', 'hatred', 'destroys', 'character', 'moral', 'courage', 'not', 'bravado', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'real', 'men.It', 'sad', 'one', 'thought', 'praise', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'who', 'man', 'afflicted', 'Aspberger', 'Syndrome', 'high-functioning', 'form', 'autism', 'Khan', 'disadvantage', 'Had', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'never', 'done', 'Rainman', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'given', 'amazing', 'performance', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'Khan', 'portrayal', 'Risvan', 'Khan', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'considerable', 'respect', 'view', 'still', 'others', 'one', 'respect', 'infuse', 'charm', 'high', 'intelligence', 'even', 'sexiness', 'very', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'disability', 'generally', 'not', 'thought', 'very', 'sexy.The', 'charm', 'comedy', 'movie', 'are', 'irresistible', 'chemistry', 'leading', 'actors', 'legendary', 'India', ""'ve"", 'made', 'least', '5', 'movies', 'together', 'directing', 'flawless', 'acting', 'top-rate', 'photography', 'excellent', 'music', 'lively', 'compelling', 'One', 'note', 'music', 'ethnic', 'hence', 'Indian', 'not', 'what', 'American', 'audiences', 'are', 'used', 'hearing', 'can', 'get', 'culture', 'shock', 'may', 'do', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'enough', 'buy', 'CD.There', 'enough', 'action', 'keep', 'even', 'husband', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'see', 'buildings', 'blowing', 'up', 'interested', 'When', 'asked', 'are', 'very', 'many', 'subtitles', 'read', 'told', 'daughter', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'distract', 'movie', 'Only', 'when', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'did', 'realize', 'are', 'subtitles', 'most', 'was', 'too', 'absorbed', 'even', 'realize', 'was', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'most', 'time', 'Hint', 'use', 'Pause', 'button', 'needed', 'was', 'riveted', 'entire', 'movie', 'never', 'found', 'single', 'moment', 'boring', 'fact', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'fast', 'time', 'had', 'gone', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'action-loving', 'husband', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'parents', 'movie', 'not', 'contain', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'word', 'sex', 'mentioned', 'contain', 'anything', 'crude', 'violence', 'not', 'pervasive', 'graphic', 'here', 'wonderfully', 'refreshing', 'twist', 'couple', 'actually', 'sleeping', 'together', 'husband', 'did', 'think', 'heard', 'F', 'word', 'one', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'so', 'there', 'not', 'obvious']",My Name Is Khan New Shahrukh - Kajol Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema
