There was way more nudity in the opening credits than in the rest of the movie, so it doesn't just rely on T&A to keep you interested. Some of the jokes I'd never even heard before,  so that was refreshing.  Some of them I had heard however,  but they weren't done justice in the film (bad comedic timing or cutting the jokes short). If you have Amazon Prime and don't get offended easily it's a good film. I wouldn't recommend anyone actually buy this though.",4,Not Bad,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,596,"['Other', 'trailing', 'off', 'end', 'Sex', 'Awards', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'sketch-comedy', 'piece', 'reminiscent', 'Kentucky', 'Fried', 'Movie', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'nudity', 'opening', 'credits', 'rest', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'rely', 'T', 'A', 'keep', 'interested', 'jokes', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'was', 'refreshing', 'had', 'heard', 'however', 'were', ""n't"", 'done', 'justice', 'film', 'bad', 'comedic', 'timing', 'cutting', 'jokes', 'short', 'have', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'offended', 'easily', 'good', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'actually', 'buy', 'though']","If You Don't Stop It, You'll Go Blind"
