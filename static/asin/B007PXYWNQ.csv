For Sam Elliot fans like myself, don't get too interested in the movie for that reason, because his part in the movie is minimal and obviously very early in his acting career.

The two main characters in this film are Nez Pierce Indian Chief Joseph, and an Old Dedicated Army General, who has always faithfully obeyed his Goverments orders.  The Goverment was ordering all indians to move on to Reservations, this indian tribe refused. Indian Chief Joseph knew, that if they are to stay free, then he must lead his people across the border and into Canada.  The indians set out on their long perilous journey, desperate to reach Canada. And knowing, that just a few miles back, the General with his Army were hunting them down. Chief Joseph was very Cunning, even makeing false trails along the way, hopeing to put the army off his scent. But this old General was also just as Crafty. It came down to a battle of Wits between the both of them. Unfortunatly for the indians, this long strenuous journey took its toll on the tribe. With the comeing Winter, came the Freezing Cold, and Hunger, then Sickness, and Death followed.  Many of the Tribal Elders fell by the wayside. The once Mighty Indian Chief Joseph was now a broken man. He looked back and saw the approaching Army, Got down from his horse, turned his back on the Soldiers.

1535925,ACKRYLMR9QGS3,B007PXYWNQ,L. Schenck,"[20, 22]",I bought this movie primarily because I'm a big Sam Elliott fan and have interest in this particular subject.  I was pleasantly surprised at the fairly accurate depiction of events leading up to and during the pursuit.  This 'reader's Digest' version doesn't do justice to the deception by the US to the Nez Perce and the cruelty of the civiians and soldiers as they slaughtered their way through these people.  None the less I highly recommend it to persons interested in this subject.If you want to know more I recommend the book 'Chief Joseph and the Flight of the Nez Perce' by Kent Nerburn.

1535929,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B007PXYWNQ,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","&#34;I Will Fight No More Forever&#34; is an overlooked Western from 1975, possibly because it was made-for-TV. Despite this, it's actually better than a lot of theatrically released Westerns from the same period or, at least, just as good.THE PLOT: When gold is discovered on the ancestral lands of the Nez Perce (in the NE corner of Oregon and border of Idaho) their treaty is broken to allow settlers to move into their lands, which results in conflict. The US Army seeks to subjugate the tribe of 800 and relocate them to a reservation, but Chief Joseph &#8211; Native name: Hinmat&oacute;owyalahtq'it &#8211; resists, winning 18 engagements against the Army with only a little over a hundred warriors. These engagements include four major battles and four fiercely contested skirmishes. The Nez Perce War lasted four months and involved a 1200-mile chase. Joseph and his tribe ultimately sought refuge in Canada. Will they make it? See the movie.Being a TV movie from 1975 I was expecting to be let down; I was anticipating white actors playing Natives and a roll-your-eyes tone, but this isn't the case at all. The main Indian characters are played by Native Americans of various tribes; even Ned Romero, who plays Chief Joseph, is Chitimacha Native American (as well as French/Spanish). The ending of the film lists the Native actors and their tribal ancestry.As for the tone, although you can't expect &#34;Dances With Wolves&#34; quality in a TV Western from 1975, it's not that far off. Although the portrayal of the Indians is too &#34;Hollywood-ized&#34; in that they're perhaps overly noble and virtuous, it rings true nevertheless. There's a great scene where a few braves break into a saloon to enact revenge on the white trash who murdered a tribesman. The warriors are painted and the patrons are convincingly scared for their lives. The ending of the sequence makes a powerful statement.James Whitmore and Sam Elliott play the general and colonel of the Army respectively and you can witness their struggle with performing their duty and doing what's right. They respect Joseph and his warriors and realize that the tribe only wants to retain their freedom, and understandably so: it was promised to them via a treaty. The officers know what they're doing is unjust, but they're under orders.Composer Gerald Fried of Star Trek fame (e.g. &#34;Amok Time&#34;) wrote the quality score and even reprises some obvious Trekian aspects. The film runs 105 minutes.BOTTOM LINE: &#34;I Will Fight No More Forever&#34; inspired me to research the historical facts, which the movie is pretty good with, even supplying a screen-map detailing Joseph's 1200-mile route every step of the way. Despite being well-done, the topic is dreary and the story isn't compelling enough to give a higher grade. Still, this is a very respectable film and a must-see if you like pro-Indian Westerns and want to see the awful truth.GRADE: B+",4,What do you do when following orders is unjust?,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,2930,"['34', 'Will', 'Fight', 'No', 'More', 'Forever', '34', 'overlooked', 'Western', '1975', 'possibly', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'actually', 'better', 'lot', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Westerns', 'same', 'period', 'least', 'just', 'good.THE', 'PLOT', 'When', 'gold', 'discovered', 'ancestral', 'lands', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'NE', 'corner', 'Oregon', 'border', 'Idaho', 'treaty', 'broken', 'allow', 'settlers', 'move', 'lands', 'results', 'conflict', 'US', 'Army', 'subjugate', 'tribe', '800', 'relocate', 'reservation', 'Chief', 'Joseph', '8211', 'Native', 'name', 'Hinmat', 'oacute', '8211', 'resists', 'winning', '18', 'engagements', 'Army', 'only', 'little', 'hundred', 'warriors', 'engagements', 'include', 'four', 'major', 'battles', 'four', 'fiercely', 'contested', 'skirmishes', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'War', 'lasted', 'four', 'months', 'involved', '1200-mile', 'chase', 'Joseph', 'tribe', 'ultimately', 'sought', 'refuge', 'Canada', 'Will', 'make', 'See', 'movie.Being', 'TV', 'movie', '1975', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'anticipating', 'white', 'actors', 'playing', 'Natives', 'roll-your-eyes', 'tone', ""n't"", 'case', 'main', 'Indian', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'Native', 'Americans', 'various', 'tribes', 'even', 'Ned', 'Romero', 'who', 'Chief', 'Joseph', 'Chitimacha', 'Native', 'American', 'as', 'well', 'French/Spanish', 'ending', 'film', 'Native', 'actors', 'tribal', 'ancestry.As', 'tone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', '34', 'Dances', 'Wolves', '34', 'quality', 'TV', 'Western', '1975', 'not', 'far', 'off', 'portrayal', 'Indians', 'too', '34', 'Hollywood-ized', '34', ""'re"", 'perhaps', 'overly', 'noble', 'virtuous', 'true', 'nevertheless', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'few', 'braves', 'break', 'saloon', 'enact', 'revenge', 'white', 'trash', 'who', 'murdered', 'tribesman', 'warriors', 'are', 'painted', 'patrons', 'are', 'convincingly', 'scared', 'lives', 'ending', 'sequence', 'powerful', 'statement.James', 'Whitmore', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'play', 'general', 'colonel', 'Army', 'respectively', 'can', 'witness', 'struggle', 'performing', 'duty', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'respect', 'Joseph', 'warriors', 'realize', 'tribe', 'only', 'retain', 'freedom', 'understandably', 'so', 'was', 'promised', 'treaty', 'officers', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'unjust', ""'re"", 'orders.Composer', 'Gerald', 'Fried', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fame', 'e.g', '34', 'Amok', 'Time', '34', 'wrote', 'quality', 'score', 'even', 'obvious', 'Trekian', 'aspects', 'film', '105', 'minutes.BOTTOM', 'LINE', '34', 'Will', 'Fight', 'No', 'More', 'Forever', '34', 'inspired', 'research', 'historical', 'facts', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'supplying', 'screen-map', 'detailing', 'Joseph', '1200-mile', 'route', 'step', 'way', 'being', 'well-done', 'topic', 'dreary', 'story', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'enough', 'give', 'higher', 'grade', 'Still', 'very', 'respectable', 'film', 'must-see', 'like', 'pro-Indian', 'Westerns', 'want', 'see', 'awful', 'truth.GRADE', 'B+']",I Will Fight No More Forever
