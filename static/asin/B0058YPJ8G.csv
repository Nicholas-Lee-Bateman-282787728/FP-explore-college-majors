1446164,A2QX8G9AK6Z4D5,B0058YPJ8G,"Aus-jol ""jols""","[2, 3]","After a rough couple of seasons, CSI has finally returned to near full strength....and most of the credit has to go to Ted Danson's character.  I'm not convinced about Elisabeth Shue's character.  I think she's a good actress but why do female forensic scientists need to be ballsy and tough....just let her be a good criminalist and not try to be 'one of the boys'.  Jorja Fox is always good and has become even better since her return as Mrs Grissom.  Marg Helgenberger was a loss but her character was pretty tired by the end. George Eads really needs to lose the tough guy thing.  In the early episodes, his sensitivity and lack of being a typical tough guy was endearing.  I get that Nick has had his tribulations over the years, but now he's just way too gung ho and John Wayne-ish....I find it just annoying now. But, for me, DB Russell was the stand out this season.  Danson is a terrific actor and his character is wonderfully understated this season.  Looking forward to season 13.....oh, and how about a change of scenery for Horatio Caine.  Caine in Vegas......could work......",4,Good season for CSI,1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,1089,"['rough', 'couple', 'seasons', 'CSI', 'finally', 'returned', 'full', 'strength', '.and', 'most', 'credit', 'go', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'character', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'character', 'think', 'good', 'actress', 'why', 'do', 'female', 'forensic', 'scientists', 'need', 'be', 'ballsy', 'tough', '.just', 'let', 'be', 'good', 'criminalist', 'not', 'try', 'be', ""'one"", 'boys', 'Jorja', 'Fox', 'always', 'good', 'become', 'even', 'better', 'return', 'Mrs', 'Grissom', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'was', 'loss', 'character', 'was', 'pretty', 'tired', 'end', 'George', 'Eads', 'really', 'lose', 'tough', 'guy', 'thing', 'early', 'episodes', 'sensitivity', 'lack', 'being', 'typical', 'tough', 'guy', 'was', 'endearing', 'get', 'Nick', 'had', 'tribulations', 'years', 'now', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'gung', 'ho', 'John', 'Wayne-ish', '.I', 'find', 'just', 'annoying', 'now', 'DB', 'Russell', 'was', 'stand', 'out', 'season', 'Danson', 'terrific', 'actor', 'character', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'season', 'Looking', 'forward', 'season', '13', '..oh', 'how', 'change', 'scenery', 'Horatio', 'Caine', 'Caine', 'Vegas', 'could', 'work']",CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Season 12

1446170,A1Y849AYTGQVIF,B0058YPJ8G,Don Jariyasunant,"[24, 25]","CSI is the long-running CBS procedural drama about a group of crime scene investigators in Las Vegas.  The show was a big hit for most of it's run and eventually became one of the most watched TV shows in the world.  However, the show had to go through some changes after original star William Petersen left midway through season 9.  They brought in film star Laurence Fishburne as the new lead and the transition appeared to go smoothly.  However, I think most fans can say the show eventually went into a rut creatively and viewership started to drop in seasons 10 and 11.  It was no longer the top show on Thursday nights.  After Fishburne decided to leave after a low rated season 11, CBS brought in long-time TV star Ted Danson as the new lead.  He played DB Russell, the new night supervisor and a former Seattle CSI.  Honestly, after I heard that Danson was cast, I wasn't in love with the choice.  But, to my suprise, Danson brought new life to an aging show.  I think the Russell character added some fun and quirkiness that had been missing in the Fishburne years and I think he gelled immediately with the cast.  I also think some of the stories in season 12 felt really fresh and the cast appeared rejuvinated.  The show also made the move to Wednesdays at 10pm and ratings were up.  It performed quite well against Law and Order SVU and was neck to neck with the new ABC drama Revenge for the top spot in the timeslot.Unfortunately season 12 also marked the final season for long-time star Marg Helgenberger, who played CSI Catherine Willows.  Helgenberger left the show midway through season 12 and I think the writers did the character justice and gave Catherine a proper and memorable sendoff.  The Producers managed to work their magic once again and brought in veteran actress Elisabeth Shue as Marg's replacement.  She played CSI Julie Finlay, a former colleague of Russell's who has a conflicted past with him.  I also think Shue gelled right away with the cast and made the transition very smooth.I'm not going to go into lots of details about the plots in season 12.  I will say this, it's a solid, well-crafted season and they utilize Danson and Shue really well.  There's a few multi-episode arcs and a very exciting cliffhanger to wrap up the season.  If you haven't seen season 12 yet, I highly recommend it.",4,CSI returns to form in season 12,1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,2334,"['CSI', 'long-running', 'CBS', 'procedural', 'drama', 'group', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigators', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'show', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'most', 'run', 'eventually', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'watched', 'TV', 'shows', 'world', 'However', 'show', 'had', 'go', 'changes', 'original', 'star', 'William', 'Petersen', 'left', 'midway', 'season', '9', 'brought', 'film', 'star', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'new', 'lead', 'transition', 'appeared', 'go', 'smoothly', 'However', 'think', 'most', 'fans', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'eventually', 'went', 'rut', 'creatively', 'viewership', 'started', 'drop', 'seasons', '10', '11', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'top', 'show', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'Fishburne', 'decided', 'leave', 'low', 'rated', 'season', '11', 'CBS', 'brought', 'long-time', 'TV', 'star', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'new', 'lead', 'played', 'DB', 'Russell', 'new', 'night', 'supervisor', 'former', 'Seattle', 'CSI', 'Honestly', 'heard', 'Danson', 'was', 'cast', 'was', ""n't"", 'love', 'choice', 'suprise', 'Danson', 'brought', 'new', 'life', 'aging', 'show', 'think', 'Russell', 'character', 'added', 'fun', 'quirkiness', 'had', 'been', 'missing', 'Fishburne', 'years', 'think', 'gelled', 'immediately', 'cast', 'also', 'think', 'stories', 'season', '12', 'felt', 'really', 'fresh', 'cast', 'appeared', 'rejuvinated', 'show', 'also', 'made', 'move', 'Wednesdays', '10pm', 'ratings', 'were', 'up', 'performed', 'quite', 'well', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'was', 'neck', 'neck', 'new', 'ABC', 'drama', 'Revenge', 'top', 'spot', 'timeslot.Unfortunately', 'season', '12', 'also', 'marked', 'final', 'season', 'long-time', 'star', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'who', 'played', 'CSI', 'Catherine', 'Willows', 'Helgenberger', 'left', 'show', 'midway', 'season', '12', 'think', 'writers', 'did', 'character', 'justice', 'gave', 'Catherine', 'proper', 'memorable', 'sendoff', 'Producers', 'managed', 'work', 'magic', 'once', 'again', 'brought', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Marg', 'replacement', 'played', 'CSI', 'Julie', 'Finlay', 'former', 'colleague', 'Russell', 'who', 'conflicted', 'past', 'also', 'think', 'Shue', 'gelled', 'right', 'away', 'cast', 'made', 'transition', 'very', 'smooth.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'lots', 'details', 'plots', 'season', '12', 'will', 'say', 'solid', 'well-crafted', 'season', 'utilize', 'Danson', 'Shue', 'really', 'well', 'few', 'multi-episode', 'arcs', 'very', 'exciting', 'cliffhanger', 'wrap', 'up', 'season', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'season', '12', 'yet', 'highly', 'recommend']",CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Season 12

Baratta,"[0, 1]","Literary tributes took a turn for the overlooked in the Edgar Allan Poe themed TELL-TALE HEARTS, where the killer was haunted by the crime, where the ghosts stalked the killer thru-out the killer's daily life.MAID MAN-ignored a BIG, BIG, BIG Las Vegas name, 0scar Goodman, the city's former mayor who appeared on the show for a second time. Goodman became the Faye Dunaway of Season 12.C.S.I. DOWN, chock full of character development for new castmember Elizabeth Harnois'. The first episode centered around Morgan with her life in peril, taken hostage, with dad back at the police station in mortal fear. C.S.I. DOWN really played at the heart of the relationship between Morgan & Conrad Ecklie. A father's love was on full display. So character development for both Morgan & Ecklie. The events had a profound effect on their estrangement & father & daughter would begin the path to reconciliation. Where was the commentary from Harnois & Marc Vann? Why does character development end up so consistently ignored?BRAIN DOE-the team is investigating the theft of brains, NUFF SAID!CRIME AFTER CRIME-after having committed suicide in THE LIST in Season 11, Geoffrey Rivas got to make 1 final turn as the late, lamented Detective Sam Vega. This like THE LIST should have been a shining moment in the sun for Rivas who performed with aplomb for the 10 years Vega carried a badge.GENETIC DISORDER-the first Robbins centered episode. We meet his wife Judi after she's arrested on suspicion of murder, Robbins has his private life upended. Their was a real chemistry between Robert David Hall & Wendy Crewson. They looked like a believable couple. You saw the unbreakable bonds of love between Judi & Robbins. Pamela Reed had a memorable turn as genealogist Donna Hoppe who was researching Robbins' family tree on Judi's behalf as her birthday present to him. Hoppe also shed's light on Greg's ancestry. When they finally do AFTER 11 YEARS OF NOTHING, an episode with Albert Robbins as the central character, they f()&lt;k it up. Commentary was warranted from Crewson, Hall, Reed & Eric Szmanda. Think about this C.S.I. fans, 13 years into the show & WE STILL DO NOT KNOW HOW ROBBINS LOST HIS LEGS IN THE FIRST PLACE. They gave Paul Milander a family but what made Robbins an amputee is still a mystery.STEALING HOME, an episode about the literal theft of a house, another round of gallows humor & the Special Guest Star Pair of the Sklar Twins, Jason & Randy. The twin comedy duo seen on BEST WEEK EVER, several shows on Comedy Central & the like.C.S.I. UNPLUGGED, a thunderstorm rages in Las Vegas subjecting the entire city to power outages. With the lab even without juice, they must resort to unconventional means to solve a child kidnapping before fate takes a turn for the worse for the child in question.ALTERED STAKES-a doctor murdered by triplets who were the result of the theft of their embryos who were born 10 years after each other as part of the doctor's twisted research. Quite an off-kilter episode that deserved some kind of notice.HOMECOMING-the Season Finale & the return of Jeffrey McKeen. After McKeen murdered Warrick, it seemed as though we would never, ever again see his filthy, corrupt, treacherous scumbag face ever again, but we learn that even from prison McKeen in still the same worm he was when he was in Gedda's back pocket. The murder that brought McKeen back into their lives would dovetail into Season 13 & no commentary from Conor 0'Farrell after having been away from the show since before Barack 0bama was elected president, before Lauren Lee Smith & Laurence Fishburne joined the cast & long after both had left the series.MS. WILLOWS REGRETS & WILLOWS IN THE WIND did not need commentary as Marg Helgenberger's departure from C.S.I. was sufficiently discussed on the Special Features. Here the producers screwed the pooch again, If they were gonna have commentary on these episodes, why not on ZIPPERED which began the entire Gabriel storyline? INCONSISTENCIES ABOUND!!!!!The producers continue to show they just don't get it. Instead of making the DVDs better, they get worse & they still commit the crime of usuary by charging top dollar for very little in the way of content.The final inventory of commentary. What we get versus what we DESERVED all along. Season 1, the director's cut of the pilot(BLU-RAY ONLY) Season 2-3, Season 3-6, Season 4-7, Season 5-10(C.S.I:TARANTINO STYLE discusses GRAVE DANGER), Season 6-5, Season 7-7 & ever since Season 8-only 2. The Grand Total-50 since Season 10 discussed on the Special Features the Season Premiere FAMILY AFFAIR. 50 out of at the time nearly 300 episodes. This is the total had the producers chose to give a sh!+, Season 1(BLU-RAY ONLY) all others DVD-15, Season 2-14, Season 3-15, Season 4-16, Season 5-17, Season 6-13, Season 7-18, Season 8-15, Season 9-9, Season 10-10, Season 11-14, Season 12-10, the GRAND TOTAL had the producers cared to give a sh!+, 166.166 is more fitting for a television series that by the end of Season 13 will have WELL OVER 300!!!!! 0VER 300 EPISODES & ONLY 50 HAVE COMMENTARY OR A SPECIAL FEATURE THAT COVERS THAT PARTICULAR EPISODE. 50, that number is an embarrassment!!! It's a disgrace, a sign of laziness on a grand scale!!!!! What a disproportionate figure-50 for a show with over 300 episodes! THE SIMPSONS has commentary on ALL of the 233 episodes on DVD that premiered before C.S.I. debuted on television. Where THE SIMPSONS has been ported over to Blu-Ray, very little has to be added because Matt Groening & his team already threw in everything including the kitchen sink on the DVDs. THE SIMPSONS on all DVDs has commentary on EVERY single episode & C.S.I. lowballs us with 50. THE SIMPSONS is also cheaper, you pay less & get more. With C.S.I. it has always proven to be the opposite. THE SIMPSONS doesn't f()&lt;k over Its fans. I have so much more respect for Matt Groening. Like Joss Whedon on FIREFLY alone, cares about his fans. Ann Donahue, Carol Mendolsohn & Anthony Zuiker rape us in the wallet & put less & less on the DVDs as the years go by. 0ver 300 episodes & only 50 have any kind of notice. THE PEOPLE BEHIND C.S.I. SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. Another thing to bear in mind, they actually CHOSE not to honor their 100th episode!!! BITCH PLEASE!!!!!!! Tomorrow I begin sharing my displeasure with C.S.I.

While it's sad to see Laurence Fishburne not on for another season Ted Danson wasn't as inadequate on the series as I thought he would be though Elizabeth Shue is a much unneeded and unwanted replacement.Also I'm sure many of us are rejoicing at the hopefully permanent leaving of the character of Catherine Willows whose annoying and egotistical attitude pushed any feelings other then annoyance for her since the last four seasons.  Hopefully we won't be subjected to her returning in the next season, though I truly wish Grissom would come back for a few episodes even cameo spots would be alright.

I'm a fan of Laurence Fishburne but wasn't enamored when his character joined the show (the character seemed a little too gloomy for a weekly show). At any rate, I decided to give Ted Danson (D.B.) a shot and was pleasantly surprised. His character is slightly offbeat, like Grissom, but in a very different way.

I've loved CSI since the beginning, and the show continues to grow strong.After 2 and a half seasons, Laurence Fishburne has left the show as Langston. I love Laurence Fishburne, I think he is a great actor. BUT, although he seemed to be a logical choice to replace Grissom, he just wasn't that great. I mean, he was OK, but now I missed Grissom even more. This season, Fishburne is out, and his replacement? Ted Danson. Im not gonna lie, I was REALLY skeptical about this decision. So, is Ted Danson a good new addition to the cast?Fortunately, the answer is yes! Sure, he is still no Grissom, but, he still gives a great performance as the new character Russell. He has that strange, fun quality, yet, different from Grissom. I love this new character, and he fits in nicely with the cast. A big surprise this season is, unfortunately, the departure of Catherine Willows. It's very emotional, but well written, and her character had a good departure. A few episodes after her departure, we get another new character this season: Elisabeth Shue as Julie Finlay. Overall, her character is OK. Im not saying anything bad about her character, we just don't know much about her yet.As for the writting, it continues to stay strong. Sure, there are hits and misses, but, there is more good here than bad. Overall, I only have two little problems with this season: I REALLY wish Laurence Fishburne had a special guest appearance in the first episode. Although the first episode is written good and introduces Ted Danson well, you don't see Laurence Fishburne on screen to welcome Ted Danson.My one other complaint, is that the final episode ends with (obviously) a cliffhanger. The only problem with the cliffhanger is that it just isn't as emotional and intense as it should be. Specifically, we needed AT LEAST one or two more episodes just to get to know Ted Danson and Elisabth Shue's characters, we just don't know enough about them yet. BUT, the season finale is still written very well, and also brings back an old enemy from several years ago (one that I was NOT expecting).Overall, although the only things THAT special about this season are the new cast members and departure of Catherine Willows, this is still a solid (and a little emotinal) season.
