Mike Oldfield is one of the most talented musicans I have ever heard or had the privilege of listening to. To see him perform live was a moving experience I will never forget. I would recommend this DVD to any who has a passion for excellent music. A job well done!!",5,Mike Oldfield-Live in Berlin,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,353,"['enjoyed', 'DVD', 'was', 'VERY', 'professionally', 'done', 'music', 'was', 'awesome', 'Mike', 'Oldfield', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'musicans', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'had', 'privilege', 'listening', 'see', 'perform', 'live', 'was', 'moving', 'experience', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'who', 'passion', 'excellent', 'music', 'job', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Mike looks cold and unhappy.The first half includes mediocre versions of his ""classic"" work, while the second half is new stuff (""new-agey"" new stuff).  The Art in Heaven piece is pretty good.What Mike needs to do now in his career is release some dvd of his great shows from the 70's and 80's, material that's been circulated on ... bootlegs for years.  This would really please his fans and hopefully inspire him to write some new music...let's face it, his last good work was Tubular Bells 2, way back in 1992!",2,Oldfield dvd finally!,1054425600,"06 1, 2003",2003,639,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Oldfield', 'original', 'Tubular', 'Bells', 'show', 'New', 'years', 'eve', 'affair', 'shot', 'Berlin', '2000', 'Mike', 'cold', 'unhappy.The', 'first', 'half', 'mediocre', 'versions', 'classic', 'work', 'second', 'half', 'new', 'stuff', 'new-agey', 'new', 'stuff', 'Art', 'Heaven', 'piece', 'pretty', 'good.What', 'Mike', 'needs', 'do', 'now', 'career', 'release', 'dvd', 'great', 'shows', '70', '80', 'material', 'been', 'circulated', 'bootlegs', 'years', 'would', 'really', 'please', 'fans', 'hopefully', 'inspire', 'write', 'new', 'music', 'let', 'face', 'last', 'good', 'work', 'was', 'Tubular', 'Bells', '2', 'way', 'back', '1992']",N/A

I have been a fan of MO for decades and have never been disappointed in anything he has done.  This turned out to be exactly what I expected of MO.  Incredible musicianship and an incredible production.If you like MO.  Buy this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.Trust me even if you don't know me.,5,An awesome show!,1055030400,"06 8, 2003",2003,373,"['knew', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'going', 'came', 'Mike', 'Oldfield', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'MO', 'decades', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'disappointed', 'anything', 'done', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'MO', 'Incredible', 'musicianship', 'incredible', 'production.If', 'MO', 'Buy', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know']",N/A

Her voice melds well with MO's muscianship.  Each and every song flows, even on the obviously frigid night there in Germany.  I don't know how they did it, but this is a must buy for MO fans.",5,Incredible.,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,334,"['have', 'been', 'MO', 'fan', 'days', 'Tubular', 'Bells', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'release', 'Having', 'Miriam', 'Stockley', 'alongside', 'was', 'awesome', 'voice', 'melds', 'well', 'MO', 'muscianship', 'song', 'even', 'obviously', 'frigid', 'night', 'there', 'Germany', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'did', 'must', 'buy', 'MO', 'fans']",N/A

I belonged at this concert! Oh well, at least I have this DVD to play over again. I have been a fan of Mike's work since the early seventies but have never got a chance to see him play live. Mike and the band play an excellent show. Fantastic music, sound &amp; lights  (I especially liked the architecture that was lit up with the purple-ish blue lights). Excellent concert experience.
