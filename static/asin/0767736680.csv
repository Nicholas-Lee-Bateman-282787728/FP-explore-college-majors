The Blu-ray collection is well worth the value plus the added depth of blu-ray on a HDTV is spectacular.  The sound is cleaner than the original VHS tape / DVD collection of past years.  The enlargement in hi-def looks great and depth of field is terrific as colors and items in the background now appear cleaner and brighter.

The other part I'm glad they did is just kept these first two Home Alone movies together and didn't add the less then stellar sequels that followed afterwords. For obvious reasons the three cast that will stay with you and what made these two movies so wonderful to watch over and over are Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister the rascal who is left by himself on two X-mas holidays and after having some fun without adult supervision begins a game of wits with two bumbling thieves Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern and the hilarity and hijinx that follows still leave you laughing. That is probably what makes the first two Home Alone movies the best of the series and it became somewhat sad when they tried to make this a cash cow with less then a talented and endearing cast it shows and the last two movies that followed.

But this is not the only 2 pack for movies on dvd, Toy Story and Toy Story 2, 101 and 102 Dalmatians, are also movies that are in 2 packs. In the first Home Alone, young Kevn McCallister (Macaualy Culkin) is angry with his large family, and wishes his whole family to disappear, the McCallisters have a trip to Paris coming up, the next day. But the every member of the family sleeps in because of a power problems during the night. And when they wake up, they have to do a lot of running around getting ready. But they forget one thing, they leave Kevin McCallister behind. And Kevin is happy when he wakes up and doesn't see his family around.Okay Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Macaulay Culkin is back as Kevin McCallister, but once again his family makes him angry, when there is trouble in a christmas pagent. And this time the McCallisters are going to Miami, and Kevin wishes that this time if he had his own money he own money he'll on his own vaction. There are once again power problems and the McCallisters are rushing around again, and they head off for the airport, and this time Kevin is wake and is at the airport, but his family is running to fast, Kevin loses his passport, and gets on hte flight with his family (or so he thinks), but he really boared a plane for New York.
