A teenager from the sticks is bound for the Olympics when tragedy stops the dream and only determination can win it back.Robbie Benson is a confused college dropout who knows as little about love as he does about life.  Alexis Winston is a young woman with extraordinary natural talent and dream to skate in the Olympics but filled with fear and confusion at the price success demands.  Her father is an embittered widower who lives in the past and holds tight onto his daughter with two hands.  The local skating rink is owned by Lexie's coach who was once a promising young skater but is now relegated to being the town's wacky character.When things are going well, this quartet of dysfunctional people repeatedly hurt each other and themselves. But when tragedy strikes they band together with one goal in mind.  Can they do it?  You bet!When my niece became interested in figure skating I rushed out and ordered this remembering it as a sweet story of love and skating and overcoming adversity.  However, after reviewing it I have to admit that I think it will be years before she will be ready to deal with some of the adult language and situations presented in this drama.",4,You bet,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,1220,"['Who', 'can', 'forget', 'classic', 'tear', 'jerker', 'A', 'teenager', 'sticks', 'bound', 'Olympics', 'when', 'tragedy', 'dream', 'only', 'determination', 'can', 'win', 'back.Robbie', 'Benson', 'confused', 'college', 'dropout', 'who', 'as', 'little', 'about', 'love', 'life', 'Alexis', 'Winston', 'young', 'woman', 'extraordinary', 'natural', 'talent', 'dream', 'skate', 'Olympics', 'filled', 'fear', 'confusion', 'price', 'success', 'father', 'embittered', 'widower', 'who', 'past', 'tight', 'daughter', 'two', 'hands', 'local', 'skating', 'rink', 'owned', 'Lexie', 'coach', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'promising', 'young', 'skater', 'now', 'relegated', 'being', 'town', 'wacky', 'character.When', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'well', 'quartet', 'dysfunctional', 'people', 'repeatedly', 'hurt', 'other', 'when', 'tragedy', 'band', 'together', 'one', 'goal', 'mind', 'Can', 'do', 'bet', 'When', 'niece', 'became', 'interested', 'figure', 'skating', 'rushed', 'out', 'ordered', 'remembering', 'sweet', 'story', 'love', 'skating', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'However', 'reviewing', 'have', 'admit', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'ready', 'deal', 'adult', 'language', 'situations', 'presented', 'drama']",Ice Castles VHS

334995,AKQFIKZNANJV3,630279742X,Andrea K. Johnson,"[0, 1]","I think I wore out the VHS tape watching this when I was a kid. It's still a very sweet, inspirational movie about the power of love and endurance in difficult circumstances. I grew up in a small town that looked very similar to the one in the movie and the snow and the small town bowling alley and ice rink and the grain bins and old tractors looked instantly familiar. I skated on an iced over slough and had to clear off the snow with a shovel just like Lexie did. I notice some complaints about the rough language and Lexie having an affair with a 20-something guy. Neither bothers me overly. It's a product of its times and 70s films were very into ""real"" language and settings far more so than the slick, overproduced films we see today. I think the girl was also over the age of consent then and probably now. It's a coming of age story. It's about the blending of innocence and experience, the lost dreams of Lexie's father and small town coach and her own aspirations as much as it is a feel-good sports movie. Lexie also has sex with the newscaster and with her childhood sweetheart Nick, so consider yourself warned if that sort of thing bothers you. I watched the movie for the first time at around age 11 and I think I got what the movie was trying to say at that time and wasn't particularly bothered by the language, all of which any child who doesn't live in a plastic bubble will have heard before, or of the sexual relationship, which is only implied.",5,Great movie,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,1470,"['think', 'wore', 'out', 'VHS', 'tape', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'still', 'very', 'sweet', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'power', 'love', 'endurance', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'grew', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'looked', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'movie', 'snow', 'small', 'town', 'bowling', 'alley', 'ice', 'rink', 'grain', 'bins', 'old', 'tractors', 'looked', 'instantly', 'familiar', 'skated', 'iced', 'slough', 'had', 'clear', 'off', 'snow', 'shovel', 'just', 'Lexie', 'did', 'notice', 'complaints', 'rough', 'language', 'Lexie', 'having', 'affair', '20-something', 'guy', 'bothers', 'overly', 'product', 'times', '70s', 'films', 'were', 'very', 'real', 'language', 'settings', 'far', 'more', 'so', 'slick', 'overproduced', 'films', 'see', 'today', 'think', 'girl', 'was', 'also', 'age', 'consent', 'then', 'probably', 'now', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'blending', 'innocence', 'experience', 'lost', 'dreams', 'Lexie', 'father', 'small', 'town', 'coach', 'own', 'aspirations', 'as', 'much', 'feel-good', 'sports', 'movie', 'Lexie', 'also', 'sex', 'newscaster', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Nick', 'so', 'consider', 'warned', 'sort', 'thing', 'bothers', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'age', '11', 'think', 'got', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'bothered', 'language', 'child', 'who', ""n't"", 'live', 'plastic', 'bubble', 'will', 'have', 'heard', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'only', 'implied']",Ice Castles VHS

I remember vividly the day I saw this at the Alpine Theater in Brooklyn during a very rainy day in 1978. I had started skating in 1976 after Dorothy Hamill captured the gold. My mother's secret crush on Robby Benson led us to the theater. (I think that was the only time we agreed on a moive--EVER.) The message--despite the feathered hair, bell bottoms, and over-eager acting--is a positive one. When great people with strong beliefs come together for one goal? Amazing things will happen. And it's not completely untrue that blind people don't skate. There is a skating club for the legally blind. Brian Boitano works with them. One more thing: yes, that's Lynn Holly-NOT a body double-doing all those skating moves: she was a silver medalist in the Novice division of the US Nationals in 1974. After skating on what turned out to be a hairline fractured leg, she gave up competing and became a featured performer with Ice Capades. She also skates in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, but that's another review...Ice Castles is a quiet gem brought gorgeously back to life via DVD. Even if you're not a skater, go get it.

A tragedy, however, changed the rest of her life and she, with the help of a longtime friend, worked to overcome this seemingly impossible hurdle.

335008,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,630279742X,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[28, 29]","I have been enchanted by Lynn-Holly Johnson's bubbly personality and amiable charm ever since I saw her skate across the ice rink in the 1981 James Bond movie FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. While the majority of Bond fans seem to dismiss her role as an oversexed, yet naive ice skater as nothing more than simple eye candy, I thought she delivered an incredible performance and was one of the most attractive of all the Bond women.So, perhaps it is no surprise that I love the movie ICE CASTLES (made three years before she became a Bond girl), what is a surprise is that it took me almost 30 years to see it.So, when it appeared under my Lynn-Holly Johnson TiVo wish-list I set it to record knowing only that it features Johnson in a lead role and involved ice skating. Yet, over an hour into sitting down to watch it  I was once again entranced by Johnson and the unfolding human drama and hoping the movie would never end.Yes, I am a sucker for tear-jerkers, especially when they tug so forcibly at the emotions. I expected to enjoy Johnson's performance, what I was not expecting was to get so caught up in the story.Johnson plays Alexis `Lexie' Winston, a promising 16-year-old ice skater, living in Iowa (which as an aside provided extra interest for me, having lived there as an exchange student.)Trained initially by small-time trainer Beulah (played by Colleen Dewhurst), Lexis jumps at the chance to take her dream of skating glory to the next level by accepting a coaching offer from world-renowned trainer Deborah Mackland (Jennifer Warren.) That is until an emotional Lexie takes to a late unsupervised ice skating session that results in an accident that leaves her blind.It is the second half of the movie where this feature really shines and shows true courage (along with its leading character.)It would have been so easy for the movie to have taken a `Lifetime' movie spin of showing a character dealing with shattered dreams and adjusting to her blindness. And at first it seems that the movie might go this route. But instead we see the courage of her family and boyfriend Nick (played by 1970s heartthrob Robbie Benson) in helping her get back on the ice and deal with her handicap determined to prove that she can still compete.Featuring the Oscar-nominated theme song ""Through the Eyes of Love"" by former James Bond composer Marvin Hamlisch (1977s THE SPY WHO LOVED ME) and Carole Bayer Sager, ICE CASTLES is solid entertainment and very easy to recommend.

Are the harsh sacrifices and the radical changes to her life worth Olympic gold?Lexie's dream is shattered by a freak accident that may or may not have been ""accidental"" there is a hint that she wanted out of the rigorous USFSA machine. She must then rely on her raw talent vs her now-limited sight for one last shot at the title.The sexual content and Lexie's cheating on her boyfriend with a much older sportscaster (who shouldn't be having an affair with a teenager!) turned me off a bit but the plot overall is good, and of course Carole Bayer Sager's beautiful song is a timeless classic.

Before I started typing, though, I had to go through some of the other reviews so that I didn't bore you with repetitious information. First off, I have not seen the original 1978 theatrical release of this film. My first encounter with this film was on TV, at which time I promptly ordered the VHS release. I was thorougly enchanted by the film and the performance of Lynn Holly Johnson. I later learned that she was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance, which I think she totally deserved to win. If my arithmetic is correct, she was 18 when the film was made and still she turned in a very credible performance. The story of a young girl who wants to make good (in any profession) is very believable. Yes, there is some language but that is the nature of any competitive environment. Hey people, get over yourselves.Now to the reason for this review. I got rid of my beloved VHS player about 2 years ago and bought a streaming video player to hook up to my big screen. Many of my favorite movies and TV shows have been remastered in HD and I have had many, many enjoyable hours of viewing (I highly recommend Amazon Prime for your viewing option). Unfortunately this video has not been remastered in HD but fear not viewing public, it is very good in regular old letter-box. The video quality is very good. Of course the sound, by Marvin Hamlish, is superb.

The &quot;Triumph over Adversity&quot; genre seems to have died with the innocence of the 70's and 80's, and the start of the cynical 1990's.  It's really too bad, because many are just too cynical anymore to enjoy an innocent, heartwarming tale.  Gorgeous photography, excellent acting by most in the movie (I could do without Robbie Benson) and ultimately a story so moving that it will make anyone not jaded by the world start weeping.

I didn't even know if this film had survived all the films being rescued from destruction by Hollywood these days in an attempt to restore so many great films.There are times the tears start to drop from my eyes when watching this film.  When you are my age having seen all the tradgedies I've seen in my life, you tend to really appreciae the young and their battles: Something you don't really see in others when you are young yourself, until you are at least half a century old.I especially love the scene when Robby (Nick) appears and helps ""Lexie"", played by Lynn Holly Johnson, face her handicap; after her accident where the two come together like only two soulmates could; as one reaches out to strengthen the other. Its beautifully played by both actors. Both kids, I should say young adults, are pretty much hitting full adult ""babehood"" with the public in this movie and the chemistry of both the actors and story make for a great addition to my library.I've also been a long time fan of Colleen Dewhurst who does an impecable job in this film as the coach.  Colleen always carried a charisma in her face that could draw you into her just by looking at her.  Another actor who has this ability is Seth Green when I've seen his performances.
