I was so juiced when I got this DVD because I though it was going to capture the bliss of the video and the beauty that is link and his quest. It didn't. I was so angry I sent it back three episode in.The first thing that upset was Link's voice, seriously he sounds like his nose is got a laundry clip on it. The second was his hair color, brown...brown! He is a blonde, a beautiful, perfect blonde!The 3rd and the most important to me I found about 30 seconds into the episode. He is a jerk. The Link I know gives up everything to save Hyrule without getting anything in return, he is a hero because he cares about the people and not because he gets something out of it. I just wanted to pop his head off.It may sound like I'm a crazy fan, but I'm just stating my opinions, I would suggest this series to anyone unless I wanted them to mock it with me or see the horror and feel my pain. It is worth a watch if you like TV shows and movies because everything is worth at least one watch, you don't know what you like unless you try it.",1,Worst Thing Ever!

But this cartoon does remain quite faithful to the first 2 nes Zelda games. (Links hair was brown in them btw)The action scenes are good and it's awesome how they made Link into such a pervert and Zelda into such a whiny spoiled brat.

The thing is? Poor quality! You don't jam 13 episodes on to 1 dvd! It lessens the quality of the picture! Not to mention NO BONUS FEATURES! The Shout Factory release was awesome compared to this... If you can't release good quality shows like how Shout Factory did it then don't do it at all! Seriously it's stupid... I rather pay the $20-$30.00 for the good set rather then paying the $6.00 for a crappy set.. And this isn't the first time...

1531722,A24JDJQWQDDH14,B007J3ISIM,Yu Narukami,"[9, 12]","Ahh the good old days. I'm a big Zelda fan, and I love the cartoon as cheesey as it is. I've been waiting for an addition that is affordable, so finally I got the complete season for just 7.99 at best buy. The legend of zelda cartoon was combined with the Super mario brothers super show. This is best upon the first Zelda game, though it may include references to Zelda II.STORYThe Legend of Zelda is an American animated series based on the The Legend of Zelda video game series for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The plot follows the adventures of Link and Princess Zelda as they defend the kingdom of Hyrule from an evil wizard named Ganon. It is heavily based on the first game of the Zelda series, The Legend of Zelda, but includes some references to the second, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.CharactersThe characters are different than you expect from playing the first game, I will explain to each character.Link closely emulates his video game appearance, wearing a long green hat with a lighter green stripe around the brow, a green tunic, and a brown belt. He wears a light leathery red long shirt underneath the tunic, pants, and a pair of tall dark brown boots. He has brown hair as in the first two games in the series. He carries a magic sword which is capable of firing bolts of pink colored energy to destroy his enemies. He is an adept swordsman and a quick thinker, but is somewhat childish. He often tries to get out of his responsibilities and winds up in more trouble than he predicts. Despite his character flaws he has a very noble heart and will go out of his way to protect anyone, especially Zelda.Zelda has a more detailed depiction than in the video games. She is about as tall as Link, with shoulder-length blond hair. She wears a pair of garnet-colored orb earrings and a blue linked tiara on her head. Her clothing consists of a blue vest and a purple overshirt, somewhat outside the ""traditional"" role of a princess. She wears a pair of lavender pants and a pair of reddish tan thigh-high boots. Her personality is somewhere between stuck-up and compassionate; she would die to protect her kingdom from harm. At one with the Triforce of Wisdom, she is well-versed in its magics and can wield its power. She is also quite skilled with the bow and the boomerang. She secretly loves Link, though she does not tell him because she does not want it to go to his head.Spryte is modeled after the generic fairies in the Legend of Zelda video game. She wears a short tunic and her short, cropped hair is a sandy blond (though occasional glitches switch it to a darker brown). She is smart-mouthed, quick, and full of magical energy. Her father is king of the fairies, and she works as an assistant or servant to Zelda. She too has a crush on Link and is more obvious about it, constantly flirting with Link who usually brushes it off due to his attraction to Zelda.King Harkinian is Zelda's father, King of all Hyrule. Although he is never seen in the game, he is present in the series. He is a tall, somewhat rotund king with a snow white beard and a gold crown. Although somewhat dimwitted as a father, he has a knack for ingenuity, is loyal to his country, and possesses a profound insight into those around him. He is a wise ruler, though forgetful and fearful of Ganon. He has no affinity with magic but has superior diplomatic abilities.The Triforce of Wisdom, a sage-like glowing green triangular talisman, is more of a magical object than a member of the cast. Its feminine voice offered sage advice, in rhyming riddles.The Triforce of Power has a dominating male voice, is more casual in its speech than the Triforce of Wisdom, and in its only speaking role, it chose to admonish Ganon for pretending to be an amateur at the practice of magic.Ganon is a large anthropomorphic pig who is the main antagonist of the series. He uses an endless supply of magic to aid him in his attempts to overthrow the kingdom of Hyrule. Obtaining the powers of instant teleportation, he also owns the ""Evil Jar,"" with which he can summon and create his deadliest minions. Ganon is short-tempered, and his plans are often flawed by the ineptitude of his servants. He has a high, shrill voice and wears a set of purple robes over his body; his hood can also act as a disguise for when he must go ""incognito"". His powers are limited outside of his underground dungeon domain, hence why he likes to spend more time loitering here. While on the surface, he must rely fully on his servants to perform tasks for him.ANIMATIONThe animation is really good, no mistakes on thatVoice actingThe voice acting is great, spryte is so cute! I really liked the voice of Ganon. Link has a real cocky/obnoxious yet funny voice. Zelda sounds like your typical blonde girl, but tough and brave at the same time.DVD QUALITYThe quality of the picture is rather sharp, however, the audio is a little low.TRAILERSIncludes several trailers to various cartoons distrubuted by the DVD manufacturers.FINAL WORDThis is a must have to your zeld collection. A great show formatted onto a great DVD at an affordable price. Includes all 13 episodes. The previous edition may have more special features, so if you're look for tons of special features. the get the more expensive edition, but if you want the show just to have it, and could care less about special features, then this is the way to go!",5,Excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me princess!,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,5389,"['good', 'old', 'days', ""'m"", 'big', 'Zelda', 'fan', 'love', 'cartoon',
