Cousin Oliver was introduced and boy did he bring down the energy, does anyone else think he was a wet blanket? There isn't a proper farewell finale, the show was cancelled while the show was on summer hiatus. My favorite episodes from season 5 include: Marcia Gets Creamed, Try, Try Again, The Cincinnati Kids, The Driver's Seat, and The Hair-Brained Scheme.

956408,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000CCBCHQ,andy8047,"[6, 15]","Fall 1973 saw the fifth and final season for ABC's The Brady Bunch. Were the Nielsen ratings at an all-time low or did the cast decide they had enough? Whatever the reason,the Brady fans were watching the reruns on the independent stations that syndicated the series. Although The Brady Bunch ran for five seasons,syndication never ceased once it began. TBS Superstation once aired the reruns but with bits of footage never aired by ABC and minus some footage that the network actually aired. Nick At Nite and TV Land aired the reruns,exactly as shown on ABC,which is how it always should be. TV Land still airs TBB reruns today. Since TBB disappeared into television history,Robert Reed,who was Mike Brady,succumbed to AIDS in 1992. He was rumoured to be homosexual. Florence Henderson,who was Mike's wife Carol,continued her acting career appearing on dozens of shows. She also became a spokeswoman for Wesson cooking oil. She still is today. Barry Williams,as Mike's son Greg,continued acting and I remember seeing him guest-starring on a 1982 episode of Three's Company. Christopher Knight as Greg's brother Peter,turned to computer retail,post-TBB. Mike Lookinland,as Bobby,another Brady brother,kept a low profile. Maureen McCormick,as Carol's daughter Marcia,continued her acting career. Eve Plumb as Marcia's sister Jan,kept a low profile also. Susan Olsen,as Cindy,sister of Marcia and Jan,became a party animal,frequenting nightclubs. Ann B. Davis,as the Bradys' housekeeper Alice,continued acting also. She had a cameo in the 1994 Paramount film THE NAKED GUN 33 1/3-THE FINAL INSULT. The TBB cast reunited for the not-too-successful sitcom The Bradys which briefly ran in early 1990. Brady fans also saw the telefilms THE BRADY KIDS GET MARRIED,which premiered in 1981 and one or two Brady Christmas movies also. In TBKGM,Marcia and Jan become brides. But Wally Logan resumes the role of Greg. Obviously Williams was unable to reprise his famous character. By the time the Bradys premiered,Mike and Carol were grandparents and at least most of their respective children were married themselves. Last year,former MTV personality Jenny McCarthy hosted The Brady Bunch 35th anniversary special and all the surviving cast appeared. McCarthy expected them all to reunite in 2069 for the centennial anniversary! Oh well,this set concludes the collection of the Brady Bunch series. Long live the Bradys! And may Reed continue to rest in peace.",5,Bradymania continues for a final season,1134086400,"12 9, 2005",2005,2448,"['Fall', '1973', 'saw', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', 'ABC', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Were', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'all-time', 'low', 'did', 'cast', 'had', 'enough', 'reason', 'Brady', 'fans', 'were', 'watching', 'reruns', 'independent', 'stations', 'syndicated', 'series', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'ran', 'five', 'seasons', 'syndication', 'never', 'ceased', 'once', 'began', 'TBS', 'Superstation', 'once', 'aired', 'reruns', 'bits', 'footage', 'never', 'aired', 'ABC', 'footage', 'network', 'actually', 'aired', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'TV', 'Land', 'aired', 'reruns', 'exactly', 'shown', 'ABC', 'how', 'always', 'should', 'be', 'TV', 'Land', 'still', 'TBB', 'reruns', 'today', 'TBB', 'disappeared', 'television', 'history', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'who', 'was', 'Mike', 'Brady', 'succumbed', 'AIDS', '1992', 'was', 'rumoured', 'be', 'homosexual', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'who', 'was', 'Mike', 'wife', 'Carol', 'continued', 'acting', 'career', 'appearing', 'dozens', 'shows', 'also', 'became', 'spokeswoman', 'Wesson', 'cooking', 'oil', 'still', 'today', 'Barry', 'Williams', 'Mike', 'son', 'Greg', 'continued', 'acting', 'remember', 'seeing', 'guest-starring', '1982', 'episode', 'Three', 'Company', 'Christopher', 'Knight', 'Greg', 'brother', 'Peter', 'turned', 'computer', 'retail', 'post-TBB', 'Mike', 'Lookinland', 'Bobby', 'Brady', 'brother', 'kept', 'low', 'profile', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'Carol', 'daughter', 'Marcia', 'continued', 'acting', 'career', 'Eve', 'Plumb', 'Marcia', 'sister', 'Jan', 'kept', 'low', 'profile', 'also', 'Susan', 'Olsen', 'Cindy', 'sister', 'Marcia', 'Jan', 'became', 'party', 'animal', 'frequenting', 'nightclubs', 'Ann', 'B.', 'Davis', 'Bradys', 'housekeeper', 'Alice', 'continued', 'acting', 'also', 'had', 'cameo', '1994', 'Paramount', 'film', 'THE', 'NAKED', 'GUN', '33', '1/3-THE', 'FINAL', 'INSULT', 'TBB', 'cast', 'reunited', 'not-too-successful', 'sitcom', 'Bradys', 'briefly', 'ran', 'early', '1990', 'Brady', 'fans', 'also', 'saw', 'telefilms', 'THE', 'BRADY', 'KIDS', 'GET', 'MARRIED', 'premiered', '1981', 'one', 'two', 'Brady', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'also', 'TBKGM', 'Marcia', 'Jan', 'become', 'brides', 'Wally', 'Logan', 'role', 'Greg', 'Obviously', 'Williams', 'was', 'unable', 'reprise', 'famous', 'character', 'time', 'Bradys', 'premiered', 'Mike', 'Carol', 'were', 'grandparents', 'least', 'most', 'respective', 'children', 'were', 'married', 'Last', 'year', 'former', 'MTV', 'personality', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'hosted', 'Brady', 'Bunch', '35th', 'anniversary', 'special', 'surviving', 'cast', 'appeared', 'McCarthy', 'expected', 'reunite', '2069', 'centennial', 'anniversary', 'Oh', 'well', 'set', 'collection', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'series', 'Long', 'live', 'Bradys', 'may', 'Reed', 'continue', 'rest', 'peace']",The Brady Bunch - The Complete Final Season

I want to reach through my tv set and choke the liver out of him.  Then there's the ""Starsnooper"" episode where Cindy, once again in a rehash from past season episodes is a nosy little imp who can't keep out of anyone's business.  So Marcia plants a little item in her diary to teach her a lesson.  Cindy suddenly thinks she's the next Shirley Temple!!

956411,AMA6SPA2A43JH,B000CCBCHQ,Cassie,"[0, 5]","This review is about the show itself not just this season. The writers kept changing ages and grade level. In the 2nd season's ""Lights Out"" Marcia, Peter and Jan were in junior high school together, but they shouldn't have been. Marcia started High school 2 years later so she should have been in the 7th grade. According to the last episode of the 5th season Peter was to start High School 2 years after Marcia so he should have been in the 5th grade in ""Lights Out"" and according to 3rd seasons ""Her Sister's Shadow"" Jan is 3 years younger than Marcia so she should have been in the 4th grade in ""Lights Out"". It's not just the ages and grades either. In ""The Winner"" when Bobby was looking at the others kids trophies Jan had one"", but in 3rd Season's ""My Sister's Shadow"" she didn't. In 1st Season's ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" Greg said that Carol was a math wiz, but in 1st Season's ""Father of the Year"" when Carol offered to help Marcia with her homework she said ""It's math"" insinuating that Carol doesn't know anything about math. Now ""Alice Doesn't Live here Anymore"" where Carol was a math wiz aired on 10/17/1969 and ""Father of the Year"" where Carol knew nothing about math aired on 1/2/1970. The Writers should have been able to remember that. History was rewritten badly in this series. Talk about revisionist history.

956413,AUS44O1LQILQD,B000CCBCHQ,"Italo ""italoman9""","[0, 0]","I certainly grew up glued to our family TV set on Friday nights, watching TBB in its original network primetime run over 5 years--and thereafter, including not unfrequently, in syndication still up through the present.  That's why, looking at the show as a whole, Season 5 always had a little bit of a cheesy look and feel to me.First, the show in its fifth year looks ""filmed"" differently--I don't know if it was a slightly cheaper version of camera work, lighting, or film quality--but it doesn't visually move along as smoothly as the previous seasons' episodes.  Maybe part of that is what seemed like more frequent gaps in episodes and scripts content and quality.  Many scenes in some episodes seemed really stretched out to cover for a lack of good script storylines and blocking.Also, the kids kind of just seemed a little bit too impressed with themselves.  I've read Barry Williams's book about his acting childhood and years on TBB, and from what I understand the kids were very into their off-show singing group touring, appearances, and agent negotiations at the time.  Besides of course becoming naturally more mature, in the last season they come off a bit too polished to seem like real brothers and sisters anymore.  Plus those clothes!  The last season was probably the best examples of early-middle 1970s kid fashions--in previous seasons, nobody ever went around dressing exactly like the Brady kids did all the time, particularly the younger siblings--but what jumped the shark was that '70s kids did not traipse around their houses in all that bell-bottomed, plaid, corduroy, and platform shoes finery once they got home from school.  They changed into jeans, even back then already!  But the kids in Season 5 just seemed a little too much poised and polished for real teenagers by 1973-74.The show wasn't working very well with some of the juvenile storylines anymore by Season 5, either: how many times could Jan go psychotic with all her personal insecurities nervous breakdowns?  ...And why didn't anybody slap or lock away Cindy, when she started to dress and parade around as Shirley Temple?!?  lol  On the other hand, some of the better episodes revolved around older siblings Greg, Marcia and Peter, who really did manage to portray the growing pains and images of maturing teenagers their age at that time in the 1970s--not to mention, the latter 3 were all over the Tiger Beat and other teen fan magazines of the era, every single week!Finally, by Season 5, one of my faves Florence Henderson seemed to actually move the most comfortably in her role as Carol Brady, and the show gave her the best hairstyling, makeup, clothes, personality and sexy edge that seemed still lacking and developing in seasons previous.  In hindsight by this time, also, Robert Reed really did hold the show together as a dad, in 1960s Hugh Beaumont, Leave It To Beaver-style, who wasn't afraid to stick by his guns, opinions, and sense of authority and responsibility in guiding his kids and helping them to be/act inevitably in a responsible and mature way.  Then there's Ann B. Davis, whose character really never changed and served as the household's sensible, caretaking background all through the show's run (and, characteristically, equally so still in Season 5 here).Speaking of, a great series finale, if the show had known it was going off the air and been able to plan it, would have been the family trying to plan and see off Alice and Sam the butcher finally tying the knot--and, in the process, coming full circle with the Brady parents' zany and chaotic outdoor wedding fracas that started off the entire show back in 1969, including with tie-ins to some memorable flashbacks from that series pilot..  Season 5 needed it, with some good episodes interwoven a little too much with duds such as the UFO or the Sam the spy ones..  Still, I'm glad TBB happened, including for being on for 1 additional fifth year as evidenced in this DVD package; this late Baby Boomer's 1970s childhood wouldn't have been the same or as fun, as the Brady Family represented my kids generation's closest thing to a kind of perfect, suburban and modern family to emulate during that time.  :)",4,Bradys Bye!,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,4195,"['certainly', 'grew', 'up', 'glued', 'family', 'TV', 'set', 'Friday', 'nights', 'watching', 'TBB', 'original', 'network', 'primetime', 'run', '5', 'years', 'thereafter', 'including', 'not', 'unfrequently', 'syndication', 'still', 'up', 'present', 'why', 'looking', 'show', 'whole', 'Season', '5', 'always', 'had', 'little', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'look', 'feel', 'me.First', 'show', 'fifth', 'year', 'filmed', 'differently', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'slightly', 'cheaper', 'version', 'camera', 'work', 'lighting', 'film', 'quality', ""n't"", 'visually', 'move', 'along', 'as', 'smoothly', 'previous', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'Maybe', 'part', 'what', 'seemed', 'more', 'frequent', 'gaps', 'episodes', 'scripts', 'content', 'quality', 'Many', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'really', 'stretched', 'out', 'cover', 'lack', 'good', 'script', 'storylines', 'blocking.Also', 'kids', 'kind', 'just', 'seemed', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'impressed', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Barry', 'Williams', 'book', 'acting', 'childhood', 'years', 'TBB', 'what', 'understand', 'kids', 'were', 'very', 'off-show', 'singing', 'group', 'touring', 'appearances', 'agent', 'negotiations', 'time', 'course', 'becoming', 'naturally', 'more', 'mature', 'last', 'season', 'come', 'off', 'bit', 'too', 'polished', 'seem', 'real', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'anymore', 'clothes', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'examples', 'early-middle', '1970s', 'kid', 'fashions', 'previous', 'seasons', 'nobody', 'ever', 'went', 'dressing', 'exactly', 'Brady', 'kids', 'did', 'time', 'particularly', 'younger', 'siblings', 'what', 'jumped', 'shark', 'was', ""'70s"", 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'traipse', 'houses', 'bell-bottomed', 'plaid', 'corduroy', 'platform', 'shoes', 'finery', 'once', 'got', 'home', 'school', 'changed', 'jeans', 'even', 'back', 'then', 'already', 'kids', 'Season', '5', 'just', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'poised', 'polished', 'real', 'teenagers', '1973-74.The', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'very', 'well', 'juvenile', 'storylines', 'anymore', 'Season', '5', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'could', 'Jan', 'go', 'psychotic', 'personal', 'insecurities', 'nervous', 'breakdowns', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'slap', 'lock', 'away', 'Cindy', 'when', 'started', 'dress', 'parade', 'around', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'lol', 'other', 'hand', 'better', 'episodes', 'revolved', 'older', 'siblings', 'Greg', 'Marcia', 'Peter', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'manage', 'portray', 'growing', 'pains', 'images', 'maturing', 'teenagers', 'age', 'time', '1970s', 'not', 'mention', 'latter', '3', 'were', 'Tiger', 'Beat', 'other', 'teen', 'fan', 'magazines', 'era', 'single', 'week', 'Finally', 'Season', '5', 'one', 'faves', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'seemed', 'actually', 'move', 'most', 'comfortably', 'role', 'Carol', 'Brady', 'show', 'gave', 'best', 'hairstyling', 'makeup', 'clothes', 'personality', 'sexy', 'edge', 'seemed', 'still', 'lacking', 'developing', 'seasons', 'previous', 'hindsight', 'time', 'also', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'really', 'did', 'hold', 'show', 'together', 'dad', '1960s', 'Hugh', 'Beaumont', 'Leave', 'Beaver-style', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'stick', 'guns', 'opinions', 'sense', 'authority', 'responsibility', 'guiding', 'kids', 'helping', 'be/act', 'inevitably', 'responsible', 'mature', 'way', 'Then', 'Ann', 'B.', 'Davis', 'character', 'really', 'never', 'changed', 'served', 'household', 'sensible', 'caretaking', 'background', 'show', 'run', 'characteristically', 'equally', 'so', 'still', 'Season', '5', 'here', '.Speaking', 'great', 'series', 'finale', 'show', 'had', 'known', 'was', 'going', 'off', 'air', 'been', 'able', 'plan', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'family', 'trying', 'plan', 'see', 'off', 'Alice', 'Sam', 'butcher', 'finally', 'tying', 'knot', 'process', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'Brady', 'parents', 'zany', 'chaotic', 'outdoor', 'wedding', 'fracas', 'started', 'off', 'entire', 'show', 'back', '1969', 'including', 'tie-ins', 'memorable', 'flashbacks', 'series', 'pilot..', 'Season', '5', 'needed', 'good', 'episodes', 'interwoven', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'duds', 'such', 'UFO', 'Sam', 'spy', 'ones..', 'Still', ""'m"", 'glad', 'TBB', 'happened', 'including', 'being', '1', 'additional', 'fifth', 'year', 'evidenced', 'DVD', 'package', 'late', 'Baby', 'Boomer', '1970s', 'childhood', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'same', 'fun', 'Brady', 'Family', 'represented', 'kids', 'generation', 'closest', 'thing', 'kind', 'perfect', 'suburban', 'modern', 'family', 'emulate', 'time']",The Brady Bunch - The Complete Final Season

956423,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000CCBCHQ,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[22, 26]","The last season of the Brady Bunch (1973-1974) is either celebrated or maligned by TV viewers. However, the 22-episode season has some genuinely interesting offerings for general and hard-core `Brady' fans alike hidden amongst mediocre offerings.First. Greg's family has to deal with his temporarily inflated ego when a talent agent wants to make `Johnny Bravo' a solo star (""Adios, Johnny Bravo""). What threatens to damage the family however is quickly-if too conveniently-resolved because this is Brady world after all.Then, Bobby gets to deal with ethical issues of his own (""Mail Order Hero""). To bail him out of a fib that he knew Joe Namath, Cindy wrote a `sob story' letter to the football star. Guest-starring as himself in this episode, Namath does not appear mad at the kids-he is instead empathetic.Ms. Popularity herself, Marcia Brady, becomes a working girl this season. To earn some money, she works in the local ice cream parlor (""Marcia Gets Creamed""). Marcia soon discovers a career leaves little time for dating---her once-boyfriend has the nerve to come in with another girl. She then faces another more serious issue when she has to fire her own brother Peter, whom she had recommended for a job at this same parlor. Instead of having an identical work ethic, he had blown off the job.Bobby has a growing experience when the girl he has a crush on tells him she may have the mumps (""Never Too Young""). Like ""Is There A Doctor In The House'"" from the very first season, this episode was really poignant for a generation who did know what having the mumps was like. However, it doesn't translate well to mine-we have grown up with immunization from this same disease.""Kelly's Kids"" actually was a pilot attempt for a spin-off series which never materialized. After seeing how much `fun' Mike and Carol have raising their kids, the childless Kelly's decide they want to become parents too. So, they go down to the local orphanage and adopt Matt (who just happens to be Todd, Milke Lookinland's real-life brother!). However, Matt is lonesome for Dwayne (Billy Attmore) and Steve (Carey Wong) his absolute best friends---who just happen to be black and Asian respectively. Their arrival causes discord in `white bread' suburbia-presumably then still trying to adjust to interracial marriages. Because Sherwood Schwartz often gets maligned for producing too bland sitcoms, seeing where he could have taken a `family' sitcom which did manage to work in an Archie Bunker reference would have been very interesting. It is one of the season's strongest points.Granted Robbie Rist only read the scripts and stage directions which were given to him by other people, but the addition of `Cousin Oliver' was completely unnecessary--and did drag the season down. Oliver is introduced in ""Welcome Aboard'"" as Carol's nephew who temporarily boards with the Bradys while his parents are off somewhere in South America.  Still, Oliver does get one `lead' episode in ""Top Secret"" where he and Bobby are convinced that Mike Brady is working on a project for the FBI-and somehow Sam the Butcher (who has been a LONGTIME family friend!) will steal the project plans for the Russians if he is not stopped.""Snooperstar"" is another episode dealing with a `spy' theme which weakened the season. Fed up with Cindy's prying into her diary, Marcia plants a `story' that a talent scout (Natalie Schafer) is coming to the house looking for the next Shirley Temple. Certain that it will be her, Cindy comes decked out in full regalia, only to later learn that the visitor is really Penelope Fletcher, a client of Mike's who is only making a home visit. The episode is notable for both the famous guest star (Schafer was/is of course still remembered as playing Mrs. `Lovey' Howell on ""Gilligan's Island"" and a transparent suggestion the Bradys certainly can be really vindictive to each other. However, Cindy seems kinda old during this season both for snooping into other people's possessions and wanting to perform `the good ship lollipop'. Susan Olsen herself was embarrassed to have filmed this episode at this point in the series!The series closes with ""The Hair-Brained Scheme"" where Greg's hair turns orange from a mail-order hair tonic which Bobby was selling, right before his high school graduation. The episode has been criticized by both series stars Barry Williams (`Greg Brady') and Robert Reed (`Mike Brady') for the tremendous implausibility of a status-conscious teenager putting an unknown product on his very-prized hair days before a very important event. It's obvious the Brady writers had either ran out of steam or just did not care their series was ending.Especially with this being the last season of this series, there should have been extras-just because this particular show was on its last legs. Whatever uneven script quality this particular season has, the overall series now carries TREMENDOUS cultural significance throughout much of America. The studios should at least celebrate this.",3,"Adios, Brady Bunch",1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,5006,"['last', 'season', 'Brady', 'Bunch', '1973-1974', 'either', 'celebrated', 'maligned', 'TV',

Robert Reed wanted to do a serious show and was blocked by the owner of the rights to the show from discussing real issues.  And so for revenge since he would have ruined his career if he dropped out of the show and broke his contract he had a writer turn the series into a self-parody and parody of family sit-coms.  And it's how TV doesn't reflect reality in a way that makes us focus on what we really have to do.  Each season is a different joke 1- because it is the real deal, not a parody and therefore an unintentional parody.  and from there with the different seasons.  5 is a joke about what happens when the kids get older and how pathetic it is to make them remain younger and cute.

956425,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000CCBCHQ,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 1]","""The Brady Bunch"" had their final season on network television with the last episode airing on Friday, March 8th, 1974. The scripts this year were far inferior than previous seasons and the nail in the coffin for the Bradys was when the producers decided to bring on Carol's nephew Oliver. They felt since Bobby and Cindy were older they needed to appeal to the younger demographic by having someone around 7 or 8 years of age. That attempt was asinine as Oliver added nothing to the series as he wasn't even an ""official"" Brady. ABC was also faced with a tough timeslot competitor when NBC programmed Norman Lear's ""Sanford and Son"" opposite ""The Brady Bunch"" which ultimately led to the Brady's cancellation. According to Barry Williams a drunken ABC executive informed all the cast members via phone the series was being yanked from the airwaves. What was also sad was that there was never an appropriate ending produced for the show. The final episode was called ""The Hair Brained Scheme"" where Greg washes his hair on graduation day from High School with a chemical that turns his hair orange. The most rediculous show produced, Robert Reed refused to appear in it. There are really no memorable shows from the series' final year, but the guest-stars was a who's who of Hollywood greats including Natalie Shafer, Sandra Gould, Joe Namath, Jim Backus, and Melissa Sue Anderson. In all of ""The Brady Bunch"" individual boxsets there are, unfortunately, no bonus features. Paramount would save the bonuses for the ""Complete Series DVD"" that includes the Christmas movie that aired on CBS in 1988 and a few episodes of ""The Brady Kids"" cartoon from the early ""70's.

On one hand it's the final season and it's the one that brought us Cousin Oliver...on the other hand, there were some very good episodes during season five and as I had a huge crush on Maureen McCormick, I must say that she had really become quite a looker in this last season and one that set this 12 year-old's heart (at the time) all a flutter!  Music would play a role in several episodes during season five.  In the opener, Greg is spotted by a talent agent and goes off to have a solo career as the legendary ""Johnny Bravo"", upsetting his family.Other notable episodes from this season include:Mail Order Hero - guest stars Joe Namath when Bobby lies to his friends telling them that he knows the football star.Peter and the Wolf - Greg has to get Peter to double date with him and Peter has to pretend to be older wearing a horrible looking fake mustache.  It all goes awry when they run into mom & dad at the same restaurant.Quarterback Sneak - Marcia begins dating the quarterback from a rival high school but Greg is convinced he's only dating her to steal his team's playbook.The Cincinnati Kids - Mike takes the family to King's island to close a business deal but then loses the plans he was supposed to present to his client.  A Classic episode!The Driver's Seat - When Marcia begins her driver's training Greg makes jokes about women drivers leading to a driving contest between the two.Welcome Aboard - Cousin Oliver comes to stay with the Brady's...BOOOO!!!!!The Hustler - The Brady's get a pool table and Bobby turns out to be quite a good player leading to a bit of a gambling obsession.Hair-brained Scheme - Bobby begins selling hair tonic and sells one to Greg which turns his hair orange just before graduation.All in all, cousin Oliver aside, Season Five has some very funny episodes and some true classics among the shows fiver year run.

The previous seasons were way too predictable with silly storylines at times.

To me, these episodes are more fun because teenagers do some pretty funny things.Worth owning because it was the end snapshot of a great show.",4,One of my favourite seasons,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,656,"['are', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'final', 'season', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'show', 'being', 'cancelled', 'actually', 'think', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'feel', 'previous', 'seasons', 'previous', 'seasons', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'predictable', 'silly', 'storylines', 'times', 'season', 'everyone', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'find', 'lines', 'said', 'more', 'believable', 'often', ""'poking"", 'fun', 'attitude', 'episodes.Overall', 'prefer', 'Brady', 'kids', 'be', 'young', 'teenagers', 'episodes', 'are', 'more', 'fun', 'teenagers', 'do', 'pretty', 'funny', 'things.Worth', 'owning', 'was', 'end', 'snapshot', 'great', 'show']",The Brady Bunch - The Complete Final Season
