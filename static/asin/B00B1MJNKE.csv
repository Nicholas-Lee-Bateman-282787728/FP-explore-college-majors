As this poo-filled bag lay burning on my doorstep, I had to cry a little tear for Seth Green.  He's so smart, wildly funny, and -- it turns out -- courageous to the point of recklessness where his career is concerned.  This thing is poorly conceived and just keeps getting worse with every thick second: The story is 2-dimensional and pulpy; the characters are equally flat stereotypes choking out one cliche hairball after another. The special Slugtrail Award goes to Alix Gitter whose uber-sultry bisexual seemed to be waiting for the scene reset in her low-budget porno ripoff of Vampire Academy being shot next door. (Are those her real teeth??)As co-producer, it's obvious that Katee Sackhoff was looking for some kind of breakout vehicle. It relies entirely on that crazed, unpredictable, manically-sexual girl that seems to be the only character she can do with conviction.  I hate to say it, Katee, but she's not interesting enough to build a whole career around.  Come back to Portland, take some acting classes, do a little dinner theater.  Figure out if acting is really for you.  Because there are simply no redeeming qualities to this flick.  A bit more camp or noir and it could've been amusing.  Well, no, there's really no hope for it.  Except giving it to the Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys!

They discuss and tell their stories of love gone wrong with flashback sequences, but for the most part its literally just 5 people in a bar for the entire movie. Well they do move from the bar to a table when the party gets larger. Its all dialog and backstory building to a twist ending. Its really dull stuff that could have made for a great 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone when the talked about sexy evil genius finally walks in with her new fiance. Hey at least the movie has actors and actresses you've seen in Buffy, Family Guy, Lost, Battlestar Galactica and William Baldwin! Think of it.... seeing them for 90 minutes. One plays the evil genius, one plays a funny nerdy high school boyfriend, one plays the ex junkie lesbian ex, another plays the black ex band mate ex boyfriend, and finally one plays the new boyfriend that got the evil genius off for murder.You learn so much about what an evil genius this character is that it seems overkill within 15 minutes and then they keep going with how evil and twisted she is.

1621067,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B00B1MJNKE,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[1, 1]","This show is like a who-done-it in reverse. You will come to understand that the evil genius will take revenge on one or all of her former/current lovers who she brings together at a table in a bar. The crime hasn't been committed yet, you know who will do it, but you don't know when, how, or to whom. All the ex's of one woman are brought together (three men and yes, another woman) to bring this plot together in dark comedic fashion.The first thing you need to understand about this movie is that it is dialogue driven. Almost everything takes place at a table with flashback scenes to fill in the gaps. There is not much by the way of action. However, the scenario is good enough to drive the movie and the twists are interesting. If you can't take that much reliance on dialogue to make it work for you, chances are you won't like the movie. I admit, I normally don't like this kind of movie. This one worked just well enough for me.I can't say much more about plot without spoilers so I won't. The actors are all very recognizable and enjoyable, though not in the renaissance of their careers. I was glad to see each one. Katee Sackoff works well as the evil genius specifically because she is a bit quirky. She sells it well. I always like Seth Green. Michelle Trachtenberg is definitely on my list to see in movies as the sexy ex girlfriend of another woman. Harold Perrineau and William Baldwin round out the primary players.I want to give a specific mention for Lauren Fray (from GREEK) though she had a very small part as the waitress. She says very little but has such an interesting manner about her that you wonder if she will play a bigger part somewhere in the story. I hope to see her in bigger movies in the future. She does off-the-wall comedy very well. Each of these actors are perfect for this type of movie and they make a success of something that could have gone very poorly. Rent if it sounds good to you. I don't think I would watch it over and over.",3,REVENGE WILL BE SERVED!!!,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,1978,"['show', 'who-done-it', 'reverse', 'will', 'come', 'understand', 'evil', 'genius', 'will', 'take', 'revenge', 'one', 'former/current', 'lovers', 'who', 'together', 'table', 'bar', 'crime', ""n't"", 'been', 'committed', 'yet', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'how', 'whom', 'ex', 'one', 'woman', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'three', 'men', 'yes', 'woman', 'bring', 'plot', 'together', 'dark', 'comedic', 'fashion.The', 'first', 'thing', 'need', 'understand', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'Almost', 'everything', 'place', 'table', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'fill', 'gaps', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'action', 'However', 'scenario', 'good', 'enough', 'drive', 'movie', 'twists', 'are', 'interesting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'that', 'much', 'reliance', 'dialogue', 'make', 'work', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'admit', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'kind', 'movie', 'one', 'worked', 'just', 'well', 'enough', 'me.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'recognizable', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'renaissance', 'careers', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'one', 'Katee', 'Sackoff', 'well', 'evil', 'genius', 'specifically', 'bit', 'quirky', 'well', 'always', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'definitely', 'list', 'see', 'movies', 'sexy', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'woman', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'round', 'out', 'primary', 'players.I', 'want', 'give', 'specific', 'mention', 'Lauren', 'Fray', 'GREEK', 'had', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'waitress', 'very', 'little', 'such', 'interesting', 'manner', 'wonder', 'will', 'play', 'bigger', 'part', 'somewhere', 'story', 'hope', 'see', 'bigger', 'movies', 'future', 'off-the-wall', 'comedy', 'very', 'well', 'actors', 'are', 'perfect', 'type', 'movie', 'make', 'success', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'very', 'poorly', 'Rent', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'watch']",Sexy Evil Genious

1621069,A1RQYTVCKYU76I,B00B1MJNKE,R.C.,"[2, 4]","Please note, this review contains spoilers.Sexy Evil Genius is a dark, character-driven, comedy-thriller with a simple plot and yet complex enough to keep you on edge not knowing what will happen. It's a rare gem of a film that, even with its flaws, is well worth the time.The story begins in a bar where businessman Zachary (SETH GREEN) is waiting at the bar for somebody when the beautiful Miranda (MICHELLE TRACHENBERG) walks in, puts a song on the jukebox, approaches and after some innocent flirtation, discover they are there to meet the same person: their ex named Nikki (KATEE SACKHOFF). Soon enough they're sitting at the table chatting about their relationships with her and also wondering why she was deliberately late, not to mention reaching out after years with minimal contact, and wanted the pair to meet and swap stories.Sometime later, another one of Nikki's former lovers comes in, Marvin (HAROLD PERRINEAU) was in a band with Nikki and he too relays the past with the woman and comparing stories, it paints different pictures of a clearly fragmented woman. Most surprising is the possibility that she had murdered a man but found not guilty by reason of insanity, only serving three years before being released. Now she's gathered these three to a bar and has one more surprise texting she's bringing the next ""victim"" with her to this meet.And that next victim happens to be a man named Bert (WILLIAM BALDWIN)... her attorney who helped get her off on murder charges and now the couple is engaged. After something awkward ""pleasantries"", including a nice bottle of Champaign, Nikki has an announcement that even startles her fianc&eacute;e: she has chosen a date for their wedding and made the proclamation in the paper which does not please Bert as if/when his law partners discover it, he could be disbarred. Now everyone at the table is in a quandary, although the three others are beginning to enjoy it a bit more seeing as Bert is a scumbag who took advantage of a client who is obviously off kilter.However, there are more twists and turns in Nikki's possible insane, or is it insanely brilliant, plans which involves a lot of introspection as the group looks to their pasts with Nikki.Sexy Evil Genius isn't a great movie by any stretch but it is one I can respect. For one thing, screenwriter Scott Lew wrote the film while battling ALS and for another, when you break it all down, it's a simple idea taking place in basically one central location (the bar) with a few flashback scenes. It's a low budget flick that keeps you guessing just what's up with Nikki and what her ultimate goal is at the end of the night. When it came to the screenplay and in particular the dialogue, there was something that kept nagging at me while watching. The dialogue comes across as not so much stilted but deliberate, each line or even each word specifically placed and I couldn't help but be reminded of the respected writer/director David Mamet. So if you don't like Mamet's work, the dialogue here will be a major turn off.I also enjoyed the performances from the key cast members. Seth Green is his usual self albeit playing a low-key guy with the quirks that comes with casting someone like Green; Katee Sackhoff is wonderful in the lead role as Nikki giving a masterful and fascinating performance keeping the audience interested even when she wasn't onscreen; Michelle Trachtenberg is, as always, stunning in her role as a bisexual woman who not only shares good chemistry with Sackhoff but with Green as well (interestingly the pair missed each other on ""Buffy"" as Green left just as Trachtenberg entered the series); Perrineau provides some interesting elements with the group especially towards the end; and William Baldwin plays up the sleazy lawyer like any Baldwin could.On a side note, keep an eye on a darkly funny cameo-like appearance from Anthony Michael Hall who has worked with director Shawn Piller on ""The Dead Zone"" television series. Until I saw the credits, I didn't recognize him.In the end, this low budget mystery-thriller thrives on several good performances, a story that while it meanders somewhat, at least keeps the mystery up right until the end. Speaking of the ending, while I did like the final scenes, it wasn't completely satisfying. In any case, clocking in at under 90-minutes (sans credits), it is a quick film that is entertaining.3.5/5",3,Entertaining Movie with Good Dialogue and Fun Characters,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,4394,"['Please', 'note', 'review', 'spoilers.Sexy', 'Evil', 'Genius', 'dark', 'character-driven', 'comedy-thriller', 'simple', 'plot', 'yet', 'complex', 'enough', 'keep', 'edge', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'rare', 'gem', 'film', 'even', 'flaws', 'well', 'time.The', 'story', 'bar', 'where', 'businessman', 'Zachary', 'SETH', 'GREEN', 'waiting', 'bar', 'somebody', 'when', 'beautiful', 'Miranda', 'MICHELLE', 'TRACHENBERG', 'walks', 'song', 'jukebox', 'approaches', 'innocent', 'flirtation', 'are', 'there', 'meet', 'same', 'person', 'ex', 'named', 'Nikki', 'KATEE', 'SACKHOFF', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'table', 'chatting', 'relationships', 'also', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', 'deliberately', 'late', 'not', 'mention', 'reaching', 'out', 'years', 'minimal', 'contact', 'wanted', 'pair', 'meet', 'swap', 'stories.Sometime', 'later', 'one', 'Nikki', 'former', 'lovers', 'Marvin', 'HAROLD', 'PERRINEAU', 'was', 'band', 'Nikki', 'too', 'past', 'woman', 'comparing', 'stories', 'different', 'pictures', 'clearly', 'fragmented', 'woman', 'Most', 'surprising', 'possibility', 'had', 'murdered', 'man', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'reason', 'insanity', 'only', 'serving', 'three', 'years', 'being', 'released', 'Now', 'gathered', 'three', 'bar', 'one', 'more', 'surprise', 'texting', 'bringing', 'next', 'victim', 'meet.And', 'next', 'victim', 'be', 'man', 'named', 'Bert', 'WILLIAM', 'BALDWIN', 'attorney', 'who', 'helped', 'get', 'off', 'murder', 'charges', 'now', 'couple', 'engaged', 'something', 'awkward', 'pleasantries', 'including', 'nice', 'bottle', 'Champaign', 'Nikki', 'announcement', 'even', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'e', 'chosen', 'date', 'wedding', 'made', 'proclamation', 'paper', 'not', 'please', 'Bert', 'if/when', 'law', 'partners', 'discover', 'could', 'be', 'disbarred', 'Now', 'everyone', 'table', 'quandary', 'three', 'others', 'are', 'beginning', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'more', 'seeing', 'Bert', 'scumbag', 'who', 'took', 'advantage', 'client', 'who', 'obviously', 'kilter.However', 'are', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'Nikki', 'possible', 'insane', 'insanely', 'brilliant', 'lot', 'introspection', 'group', 'pasts', 'Nikki.Sexy', 'Evil', 'Genius', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'stretch', 'one', 'can', 'respect', 'one', 'thing', 'screenwriter', 'Scott', 'Lew', 'wrote', 'film', 'battling', 'ALS', 'when', 'break', 'down', 'simple', 'idea', 'taking', 'place', 'basically', 'one', 'central', 'location', 'bar', 'few', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'guessing', 'just', 'what', 'up', 'Nikki', 'what', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'end', 'night', 'When', 'came', 'screenplay', 'particular', 'dialogue', 'was', 'something', 'kept', 'nagging', 'watching', 'dialogue', 'across', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'stilted', 'deliberate', 'line', 'even', 'word', 'specifically', 'placed', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'reminded', 'respected', 'writer/director', 'David', 'Mamet', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Mamet', 'work', 'dialogue', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'major', 'turn', 'off.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'key', 'cast', 'members', 'Seth', 'Green', 'usual', 'self', 'playing', 'low-key', 'guy', 'quirks', 'casting', 'someone', 'Green', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'wonderful', 'lead', 'role', 'Nikki', 'giving', 'masterful', 'fascinating', 'performance', 'keeping', 'audience', 'interested', 'even', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'onscreen', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'always', 'stunning', 'role', 'bisexual', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'shares', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Sackhoff', 'Green', 'as', 'well', 'interestingly', 'pair', 'missed', 'other', 'Buffy', 'Green', 'left', 'just', 'Trachtenberg', 'entered', 'series', 'Perrineau', 'interesting', 'elements', 'group', 'especially', 'end', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'up', 'sleazy', 'lawyer', 'Baldwin', 'could.On', 'side', 'note', 'keep', 'eye', 'darkly', 'funny', 'cameo-like', 'appearance', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'who', 'worked', 'director', 'Shawn', 'Piller', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'television', 'series', 'saw', 'credits', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'him.In', 'end', 'low', 'budget', 'mystery-thriller', 'thrives', 'several', 'good', 'performances', 'story', 'somewhat', 'least', 'keeps', 'mystery', 'up', 'right', 'end', 'Speaking', 'ending', 'did', 'final', 'scenes', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'satisfying', 'case', 'clocking', '90-minutes', 'sans', 'credits', 'quick', 'film', 'entertaining.3.5/5']",Sexy Evil Genious
