""When Darkness Falls"" was one of them.Badly written and poorly acted, the thin script and dialog was repeated endlessly for perhaps no reason beyond filling the time.  Characters repeated the same action so often I thought the DVD was stuck or the editor had lapsed consciousness.I'm told that the second film (The Best of Care) was better, but I had long since exited the show by the time the second ""dose of fright"" came on the screen.The photography (passable) and the music (atmospheric) were among the best parts of the entire film.  Unfortunately, neither of these more promising elements could make up for the flaws in what was ultimately a waste of plastic.",1,Complete waste of time - This DVD best used as a coaster,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,763,"['are', 'few', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'finish', 'watching', 'When', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'was', 'one', 'them.Badly', 'written', 'poorly', 'acted', 'thin', 'script', 'dialog', 'was', 'repeated', 'endlessly', 'perhaps', 'reason', 'filling', 'time', 'Characters', 'repeated', 'same', 'action', 'so', 'often', 'thought', 'DVD', 'was', 'stuck', 'editor', 'had', 'lapsed', 'consciousness.I', ""'m"", 'told', 'second', 'film', 'Best', 'Care', 'was', 'better', 'had', 'long', 'exited', 'show', 'time', 'second', 'dose', 'fright', 'came', 'screen.The', 'photography', 'passable', 'music', 'atmospheric', 'were', 'best', 'parts', 'entire', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'more', 'promising', 'elements', 'could', 'make', 'up', 'flaws', 'what', 'was', 'ultimately', 'waste', 'plastic']",When Darkness Falls

You can usually tell in the first 2 minutes if a film is competently made. You may not like it, it may frustrate you, but you can tell that the filmmaker has a gift, no matter how limited the resources. The filmmakers of this double movie DVD had ideas for cheaply made short horror films, but no skill in realizing their vision.The videography is so washed out and muddy it looks like a fourth generation old VHS tape. The scripts are dull and needlessly verbose, with unlikable characters and actors unable to give any genuine meaning to the lines or actions. There's nothing fun or ""camp"" about any of this. It's not a Plan From Outer Space for gays because there is no sense of style. Scenes just sit there, with excruciating long takes and actors half improvising their trite dialogue with all the mediocre passion their lack of talent can muster.These shorts look like home movies made by a group of friends to laugh about with each other afterwards. I hope they had fun making it. I am hoping I don't see anything this amateurish again for a while.

It has hot, shirtless guys, a horror theme, some funny moments and the last five minutes is a nice, horror payoff.  I liked it a lot and a very pleasant surprise. It is about a guy that invites another guy up to his secluded cabin for a weekend amd it turns out much different they either bargained for..  It is funny, sexy and finally scary.The co-feature is ""The Best of Care"".  A much more serious film about a gay couple when one is forced to take care of the other, who is very ill.
