Ford,"[11, 13]","I was hesitant to order this item because shortly after it became available several months ago, Amazon stopped offering it, posting a notice on the item's page that it would be restocked when the manufacturers defects were corrected. Then I noticed that message was removed, and the item was being &#34;fulfilled&#34; by Amazon, but actually being sold by a third party. After reading horror stories about buyer's efforts to get corrected replacement disks, and being reluctant to spend over $100 for an item that was potentially defective, I contacted both Amazon and the seller in an attempt to determine whether this item was a new corrected version. After receiving assurances from both that any defective product could be returned, I took a chance and ordered it. I'm glad I did. I immediately went to the 5 disks / episodes that previous reviewers identified as defective, and, from what I could tell, I didn't detect any playback problems (fast forwarding is another issue, but I can live with it). So I will not be returning this item, and I'm glad I bought it.

While on a train to Death Row at a state prison, the train crashes and the lieutenant responsible for getting him to prison is knocked unconscious.

1573086,A18ZI11QF1VE5M,B008OIQYXM,K. Jordan,"[27, 32]","I ordered mine from Movies Unlimited and it arrived today.  I watched ""Man In A Chariot,"" the first episode of the Second Season, and all the original music seemed to be present - except possibly the background music playing at the club during the conversation between Richard Drivas and David Janssen.  The video and audio quality are the best I've seen yet.""Man In A Chariot"" is one of the episodes that had a lot of the music replaced in the free Season Two ""replacement set"" that CBS sent to those of us who heard about the replacement program for Season Two, Part One, and applied to get the new versions with most of the music put back in.  (These ""replacement sets"" were in substitution for the first Season Two, Part One, sets that were issued with ALL the original music replaced with some truly TERRIBLE synthesizer music.)  And again, the video and audio quality are even better than the half-season episodes.I can recommend this set.  I'll write a follow-up if I find ANY music replaced, but my guess right now is that only background music in clubs, bars, etc., has been replaced.UPDATE:  I'm very happy to report, again, that I believe that all, or nearly all, the music cues have been restored to their original versions.  I examined ""The White Knight"" in particular, using the excellent December 8, 2009, review posted by Robert Dahl for the 2009 release of Season 3, Volume 2.  Mr. Dahl in that review stated that, ""The White Knight is completely trashed with Heyes cues,"" and I certainly agree with his assessment of that 2009 version.  Mr. Dahl also pinpointed the exact times where 19 of the Heyes replace cues began in the version of ""The White Knight"" contained in the Season 3, Volume 2 set issued in December 2009.  I compared this prior version of the episode and the version of ""The White Knight"" just released in ""The Fugitive - The Most Wanted Edition - Complete Series.""  I am happy to confirm that all Heyes replacement music In ""The White Knight"" is gone and what appear to me to be the original instrumental cues have been restored.I also examined ""The 2130,"" which Mr. Dahl also noted had a lot of Heyes cues, and these do appear to have all been deleted in favor of the original instrumental music.While, as another reviewer has noted, the new set just released does note that ""Some music has been replaced,"" I'd say if there is some replacement music, it is minimal.  So if you are a fan of The Fugitive, I'd buy this set without hesitation.  CBS deserves recognition for listening to the fans of this great 1960s TV series and doing it justice in this new complete series set, and the best way to do that is to buy this set.",5,FIVE STARS!,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,2660,"['ordered', 'mine', 'Movies', 'Unlimited', 'arrived', 'today', 'watched', 'Man', 'A', 'Chariot', 'first', 'episode', 'Second', 'Season', 'original', 'music', 'seemed', 'be', 'present', 'possibly', 'background', 'music', 'playing', 'club', 'conversation', 'Richard', 'Drivas', 'David', 'Janssen', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'Man', 'A', 'Chariot', 'one', 'episodes', 'had', 'lot', 'music', 'replaced', 'free', 'Season', 'Two', 'replacement', 'set', 'CBS', 'sent', 'who', 'heard', 'replacement', 'program', 'Season', 'Two', 'Part', 'One', 'applied', 'get', 'new', 'versions', 'most', 'music', 'put', 'back', 'replacement', 'sets', 'were', 'substitution', 'first', 'Season', 'Two', 'Part', 'One', 'were', 'issued', 'original', 'music', 'replaced', 'truly', 'TERRIBLE', 'synthesizer', 'music', 'again', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'half-season', 'episodes.I', 'can', 'recommend', 'set', ""'ll"", 'write', 'follow-up', 'find', 'ANY', 'music', 'replaced', 'guess', 'right', 'now', 'only', 'background', 'music', 'clubs', 'bars', 'etc.', 'been', 'replaced.UPDATE', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'report', 'again', 'believe', 'nearly', 'music', 'cues', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'original', 'versions', 'examined', 'White', 'Knight', 'particular', 'using', 'excellent', 'December', '8', '2009', 'review', 'posted', 'Robert', 'Dahl', '2009', 'release', 'Season', '3', 'Volume', '2', 'Mr.', 'Dahl', 'review', 'stated', 'White', 'Knight', 'completely', 'trashed', 'Heyes', 'cues', 'certainly', 'agree', 'assessment', '2009', 'version', 'Mr.', 'Dahl', 'also', 'pinpointed', 'exact', 'times', 'where', '19', 'Heyes', 'replace', 'cues', 'began', 'version', 'White', 'Knight', 'contained', 'Season', '3', 'Volume', '2', 'set', 'issued', 'December', '2009', 'compared', 'prior', 'version', 'episode', 'version', 'White', 'Knight', 'just', 'released', 'Fugitive', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'Edition', 'Complete', 'Series', 'am', 'happy', 'confirm', 'Heyes', 'replacement', 'music', 'White', 'Knight', 'gone', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'original', 'instrumental', 'cues', 'have', 'been', 'restored.I', 'also', 'examined', '2130', 'Mr.', 'Dahl', 'also', 'noted', 'had', 'lot', 'Heyes', 'cues', 'do', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'favor', 'original', 'instrumental', 'music.While', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'new', 'set', 'just', 'released', 'note', 'music', 'been', 'replaced', ""'d"", 'say', 'replacement', 'music', 'minimal', 'So', 'are', 'fan', 'Fugitive', ""'d"", 'buy', 'set', 'hesitation', 'CBS', 'recognition', 'listening', 'fans', 'great', '1960s', 'TV', 'series', 'doing', 'justice', 'new', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'best', 'way', 'do', 'buy', 'set']",N/A

For the most part, the episodes were uncut and unedited. Keeping in mind that a fan base is the dedicated assurance for DVD sales. They watched every episode when they were rerun on television and know every music cue and scene by heart. Then season two came out on DVD and CBS forgot about the fanboys. The theme music was replaced with something generic. CBS claimed it was because they didn't want to pay licensing for the music. Fans were in an uproar. And many boycotted buying future seasons (three and four) until there was some assurance that the episodes would be intact and unedited. CBS did, for a short while, offer a DVD trade-in program offering uncut versions but not everyone found out about this until it was too late. But now CBS released the series again in a new set (referred to as The Most Wanted Edition) which is not referring to Richard Kimble being &#34;wanted,&#34; but the uncut versions with the theme music intact, which is what the fans &#34;most wanted.&#34; Everything appears intact now and a bonus CD is included with music from the series.

1573089,A3IDMFNSBMDUA5,B008OIQYXM,~Mistress Twist,"[2, 3]","What can I possibly say about this show? For a show from the 1960s, it is perhaps the most truest and still relevant form of entertainment we have today. I don't have to explain the synopsis since many reviewers before me have in fact done that and I'm sure a good majority of you have seen the movie starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. Please do yourself a favor--watch this show and purchase this item. My mom used to watch this show when it was on TV, loving Richard Kimble. I bought this for her because we were only limited to Season 1 Vol. 1. I was ecstatic to find this gem!  She got me into the show and I can't seem to get enough! I'm only 21 years old and let me tell you: this is one of the greatest TV shows I have ever seen. It is a shame that they do not make shows like this anymore.Dr. Richard Kimble is a fantastic TV character immortalized by David Janssen. Even though he is out on the run, Richard Kimble represents all of us. He is a symbol of how the law can be wrong and also the hope that humanity can believe and perhaps help him out. Throughout his struggle, he sees that the world is not really a bad of place. Although he does get through some trouble that begins his doubt and yet he still moves on. Kimble is the symbol of hope. You'll be at the edge of your seat every episode.In a sense (and proven), ""The Fugitive"" is in fact a modern-day ""Les Miserables"" and it is very fun to see the parallels. I have pointed them out in a few episodes and I still keep eying it. So lovers of ""Les Miserables"" (like me) will love this series! Actually, anyone will love this series. Unlike 1960s show, this one is more real when it comes to scenry. Even with the majority of it in black and white, it definitely does not look fake which makes me happy.I know there have been reviews on here about a few discs not working? So far I have nothing bad to report, except the place holder that keeps the DVDs broke on me but that's not the end of the world. I've also read that CBS fixed the problem.

MILLER,"[1, 1]","It's one of those cases as with ""Bondisms"" from the Bond flicks, Bogart quotes, Eastwood's ""Magnum Speech"" from the Dirty Harry films or some of Lennie Briscoe's wisecracks in the pre-opening credits ""teaser"" scenes from the original ""Law & Order"" series. Or ""we don't need no steenkin' badges"" but I can't remember which film that's from;""The name--Dr. Richard KimbleDestination--death row, State PrisonThe irony--Richard Kimble is innocent. Found guilty, what Richard Kimble could not prove was that moments before finding the murdered body of his wife, he saw a one-armed man running from the vicinity of his home. And now Richard Kimble looks at the world for the last time and sees only darkness. But in that darkness, fate moves its huge hand.""This series made David Janssen a household name, for me it replaced Lloyd Bridges' ""Sea Hunt"" as a must-watch during my high school years decades before I had TiVo as a backup, it gave Barry Morse the clout he needed to land a supporting role in the Martin Laundau/ Barbara Bain space opera ""Space 1999"" (as well as TWO roles later on in Herman Wouk's 'Winds Of War/ War and Remembrance"" epic--first a Third Reich financier in ""WoW"", then a ranking Wehrmacht general in ""W&R;""), plus during baseball season ""Fugitive"" nights had me bailing out on my Yankees games on the radio for an hour (""here comes Dick--'Fugitive' must be coming on""). Not very many things could make me do that. Even then I still missed some episodes. For example, the arrival of this set was my first viewing of the opener ""Fear In a Desert City"" that I owned a paperback novelization of, in which Kimble gets a job as a bartender in an Arizona beer joint and is almost drawn into an ugly situation between a fellow employee and her psychotic estranged husband. My schoolmates and I had some spirited discussions about a concept of criminal justice which we hadn't heard of before this series--""circumstantial evidence"". As a freshman in college, guys in my dorm discussed the rumor that the series had been derived from a French mystery novel, which allegedly explained where Lt. Gerard's French-sounding name came from. When the feature film came out in '93 with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in Janssen's and Morse's roles, I was underwhelmed. Sorry gang, ""Marshal Sam Gerard"" left me cold even if it is more believable to have a Fed chasing an interstate fugitive than an out-of-jurisdiction home town homicide lieutenant. And now, half a century later, I can own the whole thing on these shiny little discs. Like a lot of other people, I've noticed that episode running time due to commercials is greater in older series than the more contemporary ones--""Fugitive's"" episodes seem to run 51 or 52 minutes. Plus, each set has 30 episodes, so evidently a ""season"" back then ran longer before summer break and holiday reruns kicked in. Well, this IS a series from half a century ago. I'm reading these disquieting reviews about disc flaws in earlier editions, the wrong soundtrack music, etc., counterbalanced by customers so happy with it that they bought it despite already having some of the individual season box sets. Fortunately I got one of the ""fixed-up"" sets the second group are talking about.

1573092,A6D5ZA35QYLDA,B008OIQYXM,R. Wall,"[10, 14]","I think ""The Fugitive"" may be the best drama if not the best TV show ever conceived.What make this series so interesting...is the basic story.  Doctor Richard Kimble is found guilty of murdering his wife after many loud and noisy arguments....after it is determined that the Kimbles can not have children naturally.  Dr Kimble comforts his wife after the doctors delivers this news.  Dr Kimble reassures his wife that they can adopt children but his wife, Helen, declares that would be living a lie.  From this point...many arguments and fights take place.After a particularly loud fight...Helen is shown drinking heavily...Dr Kimble angrily gets into his car and drives off to cool off.  Later that evening...he returns home and as he approaches his driveway...a one armed man lunges out into the street from the Kimbles' yard and Dr Kimble has to slam on his brakes as he stares into the face of this one armed man leaning on the hood of his car.  Dr Kimble pulls into the driveway and goes into the house only to find his wife dead from a blow to the head.Dr Kimble is arrested for the murder of his wife and the jury refuses to believe his story about a one armed man that he saw running from his house the night Helen Kimble was murdered.  The jury believes Dr Kimble is guilty after hearing testimony from their neighbors of Stafford, Indiana about their volatile relationship.The judge condemns Dr Kimble to death row.  He will be escorted by and handcuffed to Stafford, Indiana police lieutenant, Phillip Gerard on a train headed to the state penitentiary to serve his death sentence.  However, the train wrecks unexpectedly and Dr Kimble's handcuffs break loose from Lt Gerard.  In the darkness...Dr Kimble escapes as a fugitive from justice to be relentlessly pursued by Lt Gerard while Kimble desperately searches for the one armed man.  Hence...the plot for the series.What makes the show so good is the stories that develop around the chase.  Kimble roams the country with his head down taking menial jobs to stay alive while ducking constantly from the police.  Kimble meets people of all walks of life.  Some are good...some are obviously bad...some are deceptively bad...some wrestle with being good vs bad...and some find decency during the course of the drama.  Kimble helps people in need...sometimes risking being caught and people help Kimble elude Gerard.  Other people blackmail Kimble and yes...come within a hair from getting him caught by Gerard or the police.  Kimble manages to find some good but albeit brief romances along the way.The acting, writing, production and soundtrack are top notch.Make sure that you buy ""The Most Wanted Edition"" which offers the entire run of the series into one single purchase. The series was released previously in season and part season editions that contain music that was NOT original to the series.  Steer clear of these sets.The best thing about this series is that for it's time period of production and setting of the 1960s is that the series has a finale...an outstanding one at that that bring the series to it's final conclusion...a series ending two part episode called ""The Judgment"".I highly recommend this set as it was certainly was producer Quinn Martin's best TV show.

1573093,A3C37GEBHZ739U,B008OIQYXM,"Scott Leslie ""tinman2000""","[10, 13]","I thought I'd chime in on this set now that it's been released and clarify a few things I'd noticed.A couple of reviewers have mentioned there's a lip synch issue on the Season One episodes - ""Bloodline"" and ""Taps For a Dead War."" I found the two synch issues difficult to spot and don't think I would've noticed them if it wasn't pointed out beforehand. They are there. And if there's a replacement program made for these that's fine. But I still found the episodes easy to enjoy.In terms of the Season Three episodes ""Three Cheers For Little Boy Blue"" and ""Landscape With Running Figures"" (two episodes), I'm not having any issues with with playback, freezing picture, etc. that some people have mentioned. (Maybe this glitch only appeared on a certain batch of DVD sets. I purchased mine through Amazon.ca.) I can skip back and forth between chapters, play, fast forward and rewind, pause and go back to the menu with all of them. The only thing I did notice is if I am playing and fast forwarding (or rewinding) at a high speed with ""Landscape With Running Figures"" and press 'play' to resume, it will start up again at the nearest chapter. Not a big deal for me. It plays through fine and I hadn't planned to jump around the episodes regardless.So, these were all very minor issues on my set and weren't deal breakers for me.With the sound, I haven't found any evidence of replaced music like there was mentioned with the previous sets. And from all the reviews I've read, it seems like CBS has gone to the trouble of restoring most, if not all, of the original music. (There is a disclaimer on the back that says ""music has been replaced"" but this may just be a standard disclaimer. I'm not 100% certain.) From what I've read, they've also gone in and repaired a few minor picture issues. The picture on the episodes seems to be excellent throughout, although I can't compare it to the earlier sets.In terms of aesthetics, the set is attractive with a slipcase holding all four seasons. The discs are easy to get at with a series of individually layered plastic trays. There are no booklets (just some copy on each DVD cover) but that didn't bother me as there are books and websites out there on The Fugitive if I wanted to read further. There are quite a few informative extras and a soundtrack CD which more than make up for the lack of liner notes. The extras are generally short but there are a number to watch and you're probably only going to watch them once anyway. The only thing I would've liked to see is a few more commentaries. There's just one commentary on the added pilot episode by the pilot's director.All in all, I'm very happy with the set. (It's not 100% perfect but it's very close and I can live with that.) I'm particularly pleased CBS went to the trouble of revising and investing more money in this set when they really didn't have to. That seems to be rare in the home video industry these days - particularly when it comes to the classic TV show market.",4,"Very nice set, potential issues not a deal breaker.",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,2987,"['thought', ""'d"", 'chime', 'set', 'now', 'been', 'released', 'clarify', 'few', 'things', ""'d"", 'noticed.A', 'couple', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'lip', 'synch', 'issue', 'Season', 'One', 'Bloodline', 'Taps', 'Dead', 'War', 'found', 'two', 'synch', 'issues', 'difficult', 'spot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'was', ""n't"", 'pointed', 'out', 'beforehand', 'are', 'there', 'replacement', 'program', 'made', 'fine', 'still', 'found', 'episodes', 'easy', 'enjoy.In', 'terms', 'Season', 'Three', 'Three', 'Cheers', 'Little', 'Boy', 'Blue', 'Landscape', 'Running', 'Figures', 'two', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'not', 'having', 'issues', 'playback', 'freezing', 'picture', 'etc', 'people', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Maybe', 'glitch', 'only', 'appeared', 'certain', 'batch', 'DVD', 'sets', 'purchased', 'mine', 'Amazon.ca', 'can', 'skip', 'back', 'forth', 'chapters', 'play', 'fast', 'forward', 'rewind', 'pause', 'go', 'back', 'menu', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'notice', 'am', 'playing', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'rewinding', 'high', 'speed', 'Landscape', 'Running', 'Figures', 'press', ""'play"", 'resume', 'will', 'start', 'up', 'again', 'nearest', 'chapter', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'fine', 'had', ""n't"", 'planned', 'jump', 'episodes', 'regardless.So', 'were', 'very', 'minor', 'issues', 'set', 'were', ""n't"", 'deal', 'breakers', 'me.With', 'sound', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'evidence', 'replaced', 'music', 'was', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'sets', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'CBS', 'gone', 'trouble', 'restoring', 'most', 'not', 'original', 'music', 'disclaimer', 'back', 'music', 'been', 'replaced', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'standard', 'disclaimer', ""'m"", 'not', '100', '%', 'certain', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', ""'ve"", 'also', 'gone', 'repaired', 'few', 'minor', 'picture', 'issues', 'picture', 'episodes', 'be', 'excellent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'earlier', 'sets.In', 'terms', 'aesthetics', 'set', 'attractive', 'slipcase', 'holding', 'four', 'seasons', 'discs', 'are', 'easy', 'get', 'series', 'individually', 'layered', 'plastic', 'trays', 'are', 'booklets', 'just', 'copy', 'DVD', 'cover', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'are', 'books', 'out', 'there', 'Fugitive', 'wanted', 'read', 'further', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'informative', 'extras', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'liner', 'notes', 'extras', 'are', 'generally', 'short', 'are', 'number', 'watch', ""'re"", 'probably', 'only', 'going', 'watch', 'once', 'anyway', 'only', 'thing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'few', 'more', 'commentaries', 'just', 'one', 'commentary', 'added', 'pilot', 'episode', 'pilot', 'director.All', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'set', 'not', '100', '%', 'perfect', 'very', 'close', 'can', 'live', ""'m"", 'particularly', 'pleased', 'CBS', 'went', 'trouble', 'revising', 'investing', 'more', 'money', 'set', 'when', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'rare', 'home', 'video', 'industry', 'days', 'particularly', 'when', 'classic', 'TV', 'show', 'market']",N/A

1573097,A1RJXO99BU5ZU5,B008OIQYXM,Thunderhead22,"[2, 3]","Wow, this is a huge set. I knew it was 33 discs but none of the pics I've seen really indicate the fact that this is the size of a large book. Actually I will likely keep the sturdy box in a display space and keep the dvd season cases on my shelf for easy access. My replacement discs are on the way (I made the call immediately after receiving the set). I saved a good amount of money by ordering this through one of the other vendors (via Amazon). It came within a week, nicely packaged. My only lament over this is that it's not blu-ray. I held out as long as I could stand it. I've been watching some of the episodes on Youtube, which is less than optimal. CBS could make the blu-ray happen (their exemplary Twilight Zone and Star Trek TOS blu-rays are spectacular). Since very few other classic TV shows have been released on BD, I finally decided to go for this. So I just had to ding it one star, since it could have been so much better in high definition. It's certainly watchable, but doesn't have that extra bling of blu-ray (the reduced resolution makes Telly Savalas' patterned shirt go nuts in ""Where the Action Is""). I also noticed (on at least one episode) that there is a very slight ""echo"" in the dialog. I often listen via headphones, so this may not be something you would normally notice. It sounds like that artifact one can sometimes hear on older analog tape. It's a nice set (especially if you opt for the lower price point). Just don't go in expecting the incredible clarity of The Twilight Zone blu-rays. Sorry for the obsessive blu-ray rant; I guess it's kind of off-topic. But after you've seen how good it CAN be, it's tough to settle. Oh, and let me add that the included mono soundtrack CD sounds excellent. I've got a version of the title theme from one of those ""TV's Greatest Hits"" compilations and the clarity of the new CD puts that previous version to shame (that one sounds compressed and mushy). Even though this is in mono, you feel like you're in there with the studio orchestra. I've also got a few of the other music cues via a CD of Dominic Frontier's music for The Outer Limits. I tossed 'em into my Fugitive playlist in iTunes. :)UPDATE on the audio: I'm noticing more ""echo"" in the dialog tracks. Nobody else notice this?! It's clearly evident when a character shouts in an otherwise quiet scene. In an episode with Robert Duvall, he shouts and you can hear it repeated twice.
