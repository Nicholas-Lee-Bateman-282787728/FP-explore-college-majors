915302,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0009X75OC,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Unfortunately Satisfaction isn't really a memorable movie.  At least, not one you should consider watching.  It's horribly dated, the acting is average at best, and the storyline is dry and unappealing almost the entire way through because it's predictably written.A group of rockstar teenage girls (or rather, young women) wish to embark on a career being a legitimate rock and roll band.  That's it.Along the way they meet a guy who can make their dreams come true, and after they perform a successful gig at a nightclub, their lives change in a hurry.  Except, things happen along the way.  Typical, uninteresting teenage things.It should be no surprise to anyone that more people aren't reviewing such a dated film.The only segments that really caught my attention were the ones that involved the watch dog, and one scene in the beginning where a truck smashes into a van, which then falls into the ocean.  The rest of the film is dominated with a ton of typical 80's cheesy melodrama.  I've noticed 80's melodrama is especially apparent when it concerns teenagers.I grew up watching shows like the Facts of Life and Growing Pains.  No wonder when I reflect back to those 80's years I realize I didn't act like those teenagers at all- this is because they were always portrayed in an exaggerated way in TV shows and movies.Anyway, the only really good moments of Satisfaction come in the way of the performances the girls put on.  I don't know if they really are performing those songs or just acting, but the music *sounded* good at least.Not a particularly good movie.",2,"not bad, but very very predictable",1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,1574,"['Unfortunately', 'Satisfaction', ""n't"", 'really', 'memorable', 'movie', 'least', 'not', 'one', 'should', 'consider', 'watching', 'horribly', 'dated', 'acting', 'average', 'best', 'storyline', 'dry', 'unappealing', 'almost', 'entire', 'way', 'predictably', 'written.A', 'group', 'rockstar', 'teenage', 'girls', 'rather', 'young', 'women', 'wish', 'embark', 'career', 'being', 'legitimate', 'rock', 'roll', 'band', 'it.Along', 'way', 'meet', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'perform', 'successful', 'gig', 'nightclub', 'lives', 'change', 'hurry', 'things', 'happen', 'way', 'Typical', 'uninteresting', 'teenage', 'things.It', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'more', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'reviewing', 'such', 'dated', 'film.The', 'only', 'really', 'caught', 'attention', 'were', 'ones', 'involved', 'watch', 'dog', 'one', 'scene', 'beginning', 'where', 'truck', 'van', 'then', 'ocean', 'rest', 'film', 'dominated', 'ton', 'typical', '80', 'cheesy', 'melodrama', ""'ve"", 'noticed', '80', 'melodrama', 'especially', 'apparent', 'when', 'teenagers.I', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'shows', 'Facts', 'Life', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'wonder', 'when', 'reflect', 'back', '80', 'years', 'realize', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'teenagers', 'all-', 'were', 'always', 'portrayed', 'exaggerated', 'way', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies.Anyway', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'moments', 'Satisfaction', 'come', 'way', 'performances', 'girls', 'put', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'really', 'are', 'performing', 'songs', 'just', 'acting', 'music', '*sounded*', 'good', 'least.Not', 'particularly', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

Thanks to the simple script by Charles Purpura and to the sensitive direction of Joan Freeman the little story works well.The interesting aspect of the film is the cast. The band consists of leader Justine Bateman with Trini Alvarado, Britta Phillips, Scott Coffey as the token male, Deborah Harry and yes, the movie debut of  Julia Roberts!  Liam Neeson serves as the love interest for Justine Bateman's character and Michael DeLorenzo has a small part, too.  The music is fun and the cast commits to the idea of the film well.

915309,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0009X75OC,Kevin Killian,"[0, 0]","Yes, it is a good movie but what is important is the performance by Scott Coffey that lifts it out of the doldrums and raises it to cinema lightning.  Whenever he appears, you can't watch anyone else, including such certified scene stealers as Julia Roberts and Trini Alvarado.  Trini, as the car thief Mooch, gets to have some nice romantic moments with Nicky, the young pianist who could have led the Van Cliburn lifestyle but instead has opted out to discover his heterosexuality on the beaches of Charleston, SC, playing volleyball and managing to work up the nerve to kiss the abrasive, sociopathic Mooch with his gorgeous, plumlike lips.  As Jennie Lee, the woman who sets the plot in motion with her scheme to leave the rough city and have a rocking beach party summer, Justine Bateman is worth every penny the producers paid her.I can't personally imagine how she ever missed being not only the number one movie star in the world, but also a pop singer on the order of Joan Jett or Kelly Clarkson.She sings everything with conviction, and when the plot requires her to stumble on a song, she does it equally well.  And she doesn't stop rocking as long as she's in front of a mike.The plot is sort of about Liam Neeson who used to be somebody in the rock world; his beach home is decorated with gold records documenting his storied career, and he's burnt out since his wife died, but along comes one young girl who gets him to write that one song again.  JUST LIKE RENT.  This song, ""Talk to Me,"" isn't as egregious as ""One Star Glory,"" or whatever the Rent version is, but in both shows, they build up the song through the whole plot, so that whatever follows can't live up to the hype.  But who cares when Scott Coffey is 1) showing off the craziest flat top hairdo of the whole 1980s 2) then switching to a hat and suspenders 3) playing a really tall piano standing up, his little hands making flapping motions on the keyboard as though he were making pancakes or pizza.  His chest, and stomach, are absolutely flat--you could make a level out of him for your I-Phone app.  I fully expected him to run off with Deborah Harry at the end of the movie but, instead, he -- well, you have to see for yourself.

Although ""Times Square"" fans (the film from which ""Satisfaction"" steals the most) will frequently cringe during the viewing experience, the fusion of these three films is not a totally bad idea.It did give Trini Alvarado, eight years later, a chance to play the tough girl Nicky Marotta part, the character she played against in ""Times Square"".  Although she plays her less like Robin Johnson did and more like Tara Reid's Cybil in ""Girl"" (1998).  An underrated actress, Alvarado carries too much baggage (nice girl type-casting and too sweet a face) into this role to even begin to sell it.  A much better idea that might have saved the film would have been for her and co-star Justin Bateman to switch parts.  Bateman is capable of looking mean and is really too limited as an actress for a part with the degree of dimensionality of Jennie Lee.I've never quite grasped the popularity of Julia Roberts but for her mega-fans ""Satisfaction"" is a must see.  The script doesn't give her much to work with but it is an opportunity to see her when she was this young.  Of course there is some retrospective perverse amusement to be had at the idea of Roberts and Liam Neeson  playing second banana's to the talent challenged Bateman,Britta Phillips' career rocketed forward from this film with 65 episodes as the voice of the title character in ""Jem and the Holograms"".  Nice voice, excellent casting choice, and a cute performance; she and Chris Nash at least manage to give a fair amount of authenticity to the production.Director Joan Freeman of Streetwalkin'  (1985) fame has never done another feature; after these casting decisions it is not hard to figure out why.  Maybe she is just another innocent victim of an Aaron Spelling production, she clearly was not a budding Allan Moyle.  Likewise Screenwriter Charles Purpura; although his script is no worse than a lot of stuff currently getting feature treatment and the outdated slang no doubt sounded less lame in 1988.Although full of terrible music (covers of classic rock tunes performed slightly worse than when arranged for your high school band's halftime show) the film did connect with its primary target audience, discontented teenage girls who were not so disillusioned that they could not still get off on an identification jag with a group of squeaky clean girl rockers.  Those looking for a more real ""growing up is painful "" experience should stick with ""Times Square"" and the more recent ""Pretty Persuasion"".Then again, what do I know?

Liam Neeson was great (what else do you expect) as the 'older' man drinking himself into obscurity ... he's supposed to be somewhat dislikable with redeeming values nut because hes such a damned good actor .... he actually bordered on being a very obnoxious dirtbag with no redeeming values...As for Bateman well what can i say that I havent said here already .....",5,OK c'mon you know it's a cult favorite .....,1146787200,"05 5, 2006",2006,943,"['Holy', 'smokes', 'Justine', 'Bateman', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'one', 'moview', 'not', 'Partridge', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', '..', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Betman', 'time', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'havent', 'seen', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'years', 'be', 'hot', 'hot', 'sexuality', 'probably', 'most', 'women', 'off', 'HMMMMAnyway', 'great', 'light', 'hearted', 'movie', '..', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'writing', 'grade', '5', 'level', '..', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'oversexed', 'band', 'member', 'best', 'scene', 'was', 'one', '24', 'hours', 'humping', 'bands', 'van', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'was', 'great', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'expect', ""'older"", 'man', 'drinking', 'obscurity', 'supposed', 'be', 'somewhat', 'dislikable', 'redeeming', 'values', 'nut', 'hes', 'such', 'damned', 'good', 'actor', 'actually', 'bordered', 'being', 'very', 'obnoxious', 'dirtbag', 'redeeming', 'values', 'Bateman', 'well', 'what', 'can', 'i', 'say', 'havent', 'said', 'here', 'already', '..']",N/A

Ive never though this movie was corney but people seem to think that it is.  I think it's fun, eventful and well casted.  Being an 80's kid (one of the best times to grow up.  oh man do i miss it)i was a big family ties fan so justine batemans awesome.  this movie was right above my maturity level so of course i had to see it.because of this movie i became a huge trini alvarado fan and went on to watch stella and a number of her other movies.  I love mooch, shes so different from anything else she ever played before.  Britta Phillips was great as Billy and believable.  Unfortionatly i never saw her in anything else other than Jem and the Rockers.  Julia Roberts is great but she really wasnt given a huge role to work with.One of the best things about this movie is the music.  Justine Bateman singing ""Talk to Me"" is still one of my favorite movie performances.  ""Iko Iko"", ""Mr Big Stuff"" and of course their cover of the rolling stones ""Satisfaction"".  This movies total kick back on the couch with a 6 pack and a pizza stay at home fun.Dont worry about it being outdated. Get it.  Its great and its cheap.  Ive never thought of this movie as corney.  Its 80s but it deals with alot of things from trying to find yourself, that friend that you cant get through to that just wont quit getting loaded, poverty, and trying to be an honest car theft and yet the other car thefts just wont get out of your way.
