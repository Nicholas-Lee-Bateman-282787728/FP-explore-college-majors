551387,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00004U104,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","""If these walls could talk two"" was released eight years ago,and it's an interesting snapshot of attitudes towards lesbians nearly a decade ago. HBO turns lesbian romance into a ""made-for-TV"" movie. While the stories tend to be preachy (the second about gender roles,the third about childbearing),the acting is strong,and the soundtrack powerful.1961- In the first segment, Vanessa Redgrave exudes dignity as Edith Tree,a woman losing her beloved home when she meets her partner's estranged nephew and his prudish,snotty wife (Paul Giamatti&Elizabeth; Perkins) Redgrave's performance is poignant&sympathetic.; When her partner Abigail Henley unexpectedly dies from a stroke, Edith must cope alone. She's compassionate despite the fact that people aren't compassionate to her. She can only refer to her longtime lover as a ""friend."" Classical music complements this segment.1972- Tree's former home is now a Happy Lesbian Commune. Michelle Williams stars as a young,feminine lesbian who finds herself smitten with the manly Chloe Sevigny. Sevigny is a real gentleman. In this segment, Williams finds herself mocked by her friends for adhering to gender stereotypes. Sevigny stubbornly refuses to define herself as male or female. Strong acting from Williams&Sevigny;,who consummate their relationship to the strains of Santana, but preachy and contrived.2000- The Lesbian Commune is now an upscale yuppie home. Ellen DeGeneres is humorous&sympathetic; as a woman who wants to impregnate her partner (Sharon Stone,who's clearly having fun) They have real chemistry. DeGeneres gets the best lines. However,it feels contrived; Stone gets pregnant after only four tries (IVF is more complicated) Both watch children at a playground for some reason. Again,it gets preachy about prejudice&parenthood.;""Walls could talk two"" is a mixed bag. For the most part,the situations and dialogue feel contrived. There's a sense of artificiality. It's more magical realism than realism. It has more of the feel of a '50s educational film than a drama. Still,""Walls"" is an interesting artifact about how attitudes towards lesbians have changed.

So men fall in love with men and women fall in love with women. Big Deal. If it makes them happy and that's who they choose then why not?

The acting is perfect, they make you feel all the emotions you're supposed to feel in different scenes. Its 3 short stories that all have a different meaning/struggle within lesbianism. The first one is about and elderly lesbian couple and how they had to hide all their life even after one of them  was gone. The remaining ""wife"" was left with no one else in the world. The second one takes place around the hippie era when feminist activists were at large. It shows how the butch type lesbians were looked down upon. The last one stars Ellen and Sharon Stone as a lesbian couple in the 20th century trying to have children and how difficult it can be. I hope I didnt give away too much but its just hard to explain the plots without giving it away! I really do recommend this to everyone. I say everyone not just gay people because I think its something that even straight people need to be aware of.

It's incredible. It details a lesbian couple in their &quot;golden-ages&quot; during the 60s. It is one heck of a performance by Redgrave, who mourns the death of her loved one.The second segment looks at a group of feminist lesbians - one of whom (Williams) falls in love with a non-feminist lesbian (Sevigny). This, I believe, is certainly the best acting duo of the trio of segments. These two work well together, and Chloe honestly has the best performance of the movie. Her role, as a &quot;guy dressing&quot; lesbian is absolutely incredible. Michelle Williams is definitely deserving of credit here - for being able to step outside her Dawson's Creek - and play someone else entirely. I must say I was surprised at her doing a nude scene. Not bad or good, just surprised - something that she might have been shooting for (as per Jessica Biel's Gear nude photoshoot).The final segment is a bit too quick, and honestly unbelievable. I didn't think there was much chemistry there between Degeneres and Stone (who play a lesbian couple in 2000 trying to have a kid.) Degeneres quickly stepped into her &quot;Ellen&quot; role - and Stone seemed arrogant, and slightly aloof. It was definitely the funniest of the three segments, but I enjoyed this the least of the trio.Overall, the script was very good, and certainly took a good look at what being lesbian has meant throughout the past few decades. Very well acted, very well casted, very well directed, very well written.

I was in tears by the end of this first segment.  It was  even more poignant because the situations she encounters are still  realities in today's world; they have not been relegated to the past.  Unfortunately, the second segment seemed to be a re-hash from &quot;Boys  Don't Cry&quot; - It almost felt like it was something that hit the editing  floor from that movie and the producers wanted to still use it....so they  stuck it in here.

There's nothing original or creative about any of this; the acting is mediocre, the dialogue is mediocre, the cinematography is mediocre... it's more of an exercise in pro-lesbian propaganda than an actual movie.Mind you, I agree with everything it's saying, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a film that plays it TOO safe. All our protagonists are flawless, endearing people, while all the ""normal"" heterosexual people are ugly, narrow-minded, and hypocritical.  Also, the lesbians are all slim and attractive while the heterosexuals are all overweight. It's this sort of thing that makes you realize that ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" isn't nearly as progressive as it would like to be.Here is a film that takes no real chances and has no real passion for any of its characters.

551402,A2Y1SCM930PZI7,B00004U104,Jabberwocky,"[5, 6]","If These Walls Could Talk 2 explores female same sex relationships in different eras, but in the same house.The first story deals with an old woman who loses her longtime lover due to a fall from a ladder and the eventual death. The dead woman's son and daughter-in-law and granddaughter show up and basically take what is lawfully theirs, the house and its possessions. The old woman is left with nothing and is forced to start over somewhere else despite being in her 60s. I kept thinking to myself, all of this could have been avoided had the dead woman made a will. This story basically deals with how same sex couples don't have the same legal rights. Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the left-behind lover, can't even visit her companion in the hospital room because she's not a relative or spouse. This was definitely the heartwrenching one of the three vignettes.The second story takes place during the women's feminist movement. Some college lesbian girls go to a gay bar where one of them, Michelle Williams, meets Chloe Sevigny and a romance develops. The only thing, Sevigny's character is butch. And Williams' friends have a problem with a woman acting like a man in order to live the lesbian lifestyle. They see it as defeating the purpose of being a lesbian in the first place. Pretty good performances all around. Nia Long and Natasha Leonne are in the story: both who have played lesbians in other movies.The third segment deals with a lesbian couple trying to have a baby. It stars Ellen Degeneres and Sharon Stone. This one is boring. All you see is frantic anticipation and turkey basters. There is a surprising steamy sex scene. It's surprising because I never thought a sex scene with Ellen Degeneres could be steamy. I applaud Anne Heche as a director for being able to pull that off. But, it's still a less compelling story than the other two.All in all, If These Walls...2 is a good movie.

Thank god for HBO, I've seen it many times on it, and it's sort of a guilty pleasure.  I can't help but watch it everytime it comes on.  I thought every story was very moving, with the perfect cast to pull it all off.  I thought the first segment was very touching, but I couldn't really relate to it, so it was hard to really get into it.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed the second and third segments.  The second segment with Michelle Williams, Nia Long, and Chloe Sevigny were fantastic.  It struck a chord in me, I realized how biased the world can be towards one another.  I liked the irony of one lesbian being incredibly ignorant to another, because they weren't ""lesbian"" enough.  It revealed to me how cynical we all can be.  I disagree with a lot of the reviews about the third segment, I thought it was great!  It was humorous and heart-felt.  It is by far, Ellen DeGeneres's best performance.  Sharon Stone was so comical, which the enitre movie needed.  Ellen and Sharon had great chemistry, in my opinion.  The seemed very believable, from the passion towards one-another, to the commitment of trying to conceive.  They were a truly loving and commited couple, which I respected very much.

I also felt a connection, and understanding. I have never been one to be prejudice agianst people, but I think I was naive. This movie really opened my eyes to a lot.I liked this movie, and each segment, but they didn't seem to work together as in the first ITWCT movie. Sure, they all dealt with lesbianism, but all with such differnet angles.The first segment I have seen many, many times... and I still cant get past it without crying. It was superbly acted by everyone! Vanessa was amazing, I can't think of a word to describe how moving her perfromance was. Elisabeth Perkens was magnicificent. Didn't we all want to slap some sense into her and her husband. Even the little girl acted very well. You got a sence that she instinctively knew what was going on, and with a child's &quot;honesty&quot; and naivity (don't think thats a word, but you get the idea) tried to comfort Vanessa in the only way she knew.The second part didn't speak to me that much. I'm not sure why, but I didn't enjoy it all that much. The scene with the friends trying to change Chloe was horrid and almost painful to watch though. That was the only moving scene for me. As for the lovemaking scene, and I speak for the one in the 3rd segment also, I thought they were tastefully done, and showed the beauty of two women, not the male &quot;eroticicsm&quot; factor we normally see of two women. It was beautiful.The third segment was nice to watch, but was far out of place. It was the only segment in either of the movies that was comical. It seemed a bit light and superficial. Some moments were great, like the turkey baster! And what was with them at the park. If I saw two people, no matter who repeatedly coming to watch children there, none of which were their own, I frankly wouldn't feel comfortable.

551408,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004U104,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" is neither as controversial nor as depressing as the first HBO movie in what could be an interesting series if they keep changing the topics as they go along. The first time around the conceit was that all three women who lived in this particular house found themselves pregnant and dealing in different ways at different times in history (post-World War II) with the topic of abortion. This time the house in question is inhabited by lesbians and not only is the death count half what it was before in this 2000 movie, it actually goes with a cute ending, something obviously precluded by the abortion topic.The common denominator here is to depict the decidedly different problems faced by lesbians at different points in time. In 1961 we have a pair of ""maiden aunts,"" Edith Tree (Vanessa Redgrave) and Abby Hedley (Marian Seldes), who dare not walk too close in public and who have to stop hand holding when anybody might be watching them in a dark movie theater (where, pointedly, ""The Children's Hour"" is showing). When one of the women dies suddenly, the other has to endure her partner's relatives (Paul Giamatti and Elizabeth Perkins) showing up ready to clean her home out. The fact that the two women were lovers is unspoken, but palatable, as insult is added to injury. When I see something like this, where a relationship that has lasted decades is so casually dismissed because it is socially unacceptable, I always think of the irony that Britney Spears getting drunk and decided to get married in Las Vegas (and then annulled) one weekend in Las Vegas is, in contrast, to be considered a sanctified relationship. Irony abounds. This segment is certainly the most touching of the three, and offers solid performances from all involved.In 1972 a quartet of lesbian college students are inhabiting the house. In contrast to Tree and Abby, these girls get to flaunt their sexual orientation. Then they discover that they are too blatant for the other feminists on campus who are caught up in the women's liberation movement, and are a decidedly different generation of lesbians from those who came before when they come across a lesbian bar. The culture clash comes crashing down on Linda (Michelle Williams), who finds she is interested in Linda (Chlo Sevigny), who binds her breasts and wears a shirt and a tie. Here the irony is that her housemates (Nia Long, Natasha Lyonne), who do not want to be judged by others, are so willing to judge other lesbians for not doing it the right way. Some lesbians being prejudiced against other lesbians is an interesting twist.When we get to 2000 the problem faced by Fran (Sharon Stone) and Kal (Ellen DeGeneres) their lesbianism is not so much a problem as a twist. The couple want to have a baby, which means they have to jump through the same sort of hoops faced by couples with more traditional, for lack of a better word, problems with infertility. This segment stands out from the others because it is pure comedy where the conflict is over which sperm donor to use and finding creative ways to keep for Fran to keep her legs in the air to help facilitate the fertilization. Regina King and Kathy Najimy join in on the fun as well.The 2000 segment was written and directed by Anne Heche, a fact that adds all sorts of interesting elements of irony to watching it. The 1961 segment was written and directed by Jane Anderson, while the 1972 segment is directed by Martha Coolidge with a teleplay by Sylvia Sichel, who wrote the story with Alex Sichel. The three segments are certainly sympathetic to the sexual orientation of the characters, who are spared any overt attacks on their life style, unlike the women in the first film, where both sides were present in all three stories. Now the question is what will they come up for the ""If These Walls Could Talk 2""? Will it continue to be a female oriented series or do walls talk about males as well? Stay tuned.",4,This time a triptych of tales about the problems of lesbians,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,3952,"['Walls', 'Could', 'Talk', '2', 'controversial', 'as', 'depressing', 'first', 'HBO', 'movie', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'series', 'keep', 'changing', 'topics', 'go', 'along', 'first', 'time', 'conceit', 'was', 'three', 'women', 'who', 'lived', 'particular', 'house', 'found', 'pregnant', 'dealing', 'different', 'ways', 'different', 'times', 'history', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'topic', 'abortion', 'time', 'house', 'question', 'inhabited', 'lesbians', 'not', 'only', 'death', 'count', 'half', 'what', 'was', 'before', '2000', 'movie', 'actually', 'cute', 'ending', 'something', 'obviously', 'precluded', 'abortion', 'topic.The', 'common', 'denominator', 'here', 'depict', 'decidedly', 'different', 'problems', 'faced', 'lesbians', 'different', 'points', 'time', '1961', 'have', 'pair', 'maiden', 'aunts', 'Edith', 'Tree', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Abby', 'Hedley', 'Marian', 'Seldes', 'who', 'not', 'walk', 'too', 'close', 'public', 'who', 'have', 'stop', 'hand', 'holding', 'when', 'anybody', 'might', 'be', 'watching', 'dark', 'movie', 'theater', 'where', 'pointedly', 'Children', 'Hour', 'showing', 'When', 'one', 'women', 'suddenly', 'other', 'endure', 'partner', 'relatives', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'showing', 'up', 'ready', 'clean', 'home', 'fact', 'two', 'women', 'were', 'lovers', 'unspoken', 'palatable', 'insult', 'added', 'injury', 'When', 'see', 'something', 'where', 'relationship', 'lasted', 'decades', 'so', 'casually', 'dismissed', 'socially', 'unacceptable', 'always', 'think', 'irony', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'getting', 'drunk', 'decided', 'get', 'married', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'then', 'annulled', 'one', 'weekend', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'contrast', 'be', 'considered', 'sanctified', 'relationship', 'Irony', 'segment', 'certainly', 'most', 'touching', 'three', 'solid', 'performances', 'involved.In', '1972', 'quartet', 'lesbian', 'college', 'students', 'are', 'inhabiting', 'house', 'contrast', 'Tree', 'Abby', 'girls', 'get', 'flaunt', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'Then', 'discover', 'are', 'too', 'blatant', 'other', 'feminists', 'campus', 'who', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'women', 'liberation', 'movement', 'are', 'decidedly', 'different', 'generation', 'lesbians', 'who', 'came', 'when', 'come', 'lesbian', 'bar', 'culture', 'clash', 'crashing', 'down', 'Linda', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'who', 'interested', 'Linda', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'who', 'breasts', 'shirt', 'tie', 'Here', 'irony', 'housemates', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'judged', 'others', 'are', 'so', 'willing', 'judge', 'other', 'lesbians', 'not', 'doing', 'right', 'way', 'lesbians', 'being', 'prejudiced', 'other', 'lesbians', 'interesting', 'twist.When', 'get', '2000', 'problem', 'faced', 'Fran', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Kal', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'lesbianism', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'problem', 'twist', 'couple', 'want', 'have', 'baby', 'have', 'jump', 'same', 'sort', 'hoops', 'faced', 'couples', 'more', 'traditional', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'problems', 'infertility', 'segment', 'out', 'others', 'pure', 'comedy', 'where', 'conflict', 'sperm', 'donor', 'use', 'finding', 'creative', 'ways', 'keep', 'Fran', 'keep', 'legs', 'air', 'help', 'facilitate', 'fertilization', 'Regina', 'King', 'Kathy', 'Najimy', 'join', 'fun', 'well.The', '2000', 'segment', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'fact', 'sorts', 'interesting', 'elements', 'irony', 'watching', '1961', 'segment', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Jane', 'Anderson', '1972', 'segment', 'directed', 'Martha', 'Coolidge', 'teleplay', 'Sylvia', 'Sichel', 'who', 'wrote', 'story', 'Alex', 'Sichel', 'three', 'segments', 'are', 'certainly', 'sympathetic', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'spared', 'overt', 'attacks', 'life', 'style', 'women', 'first', 'film', 'where', 'sides', 'were', 'present', 'three', 'stories', 'Now', 'question', 'what', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'Walls', 'Could', 'Talk', '2', 'Will', 'continue', 'be', 'female', 'oriented', 'series', 'do', 'walls', 'talk', 'about', 'males', 'as', 'well', 'Stay', 'tuned']",If These Walls Could Talk 2

551414,A107H3XGCV6Y4Q,B00004U104,"Paige Turner ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","The three stories portray three different phases of lesbian relationships. ""1961"" depicts a 50-year relationship that suddenly ends with the death of one partner; ""1972"" depicts a new relationship between a college-aged lesbian feminist and a blue-collar boyish female; ""2000"" depicts an established relationship of a middle-aged lesbian couple attempting to have a baby. These stories also show the evolution of how lesbians are viewed and accepted in society, the first showing extreme repression, the last showing more openness.""1961"" is the most emotionally powerful, both in acting and photography. The dark, subdued lighting reflects the somberness of the story and gives the film a nostalgic, long-ago quality. Vanessa Redgrave is superbly brilliant as Edith Tree, the widowed partner who sees her life falling apart after her lover Abby dies. Poignant and sad, the story serves as a painful reminder of the deeply closeted, repressed lives lesbians were forced to lead (and still do to some extent). The two women are shown walking home from a movie, far apart, not daring to touch each other, lest they attract attention and jeers. Before Abby's heirs come over to stake claim on household possessions, Edith carefully removes photos and mementos that would indicate a ""less-than-proper"" relationship between the two spinster schoolteachers. You can see the quiet, intense desperation of Edith when she is denied access to dying lover in the hospital because she is not family; and again when her home and possessions are taken away by the Abby's greedy heirs. Redgrave portrays Edith with dignity, and strength, contrasting splendidly with the callous greediness of her lover's heirs.""1972"" is the story of a lesbian feminist, Linda, who is attracted to Amy, a butch female whose fashion statement is men's clothing and ace bandages for lingerie. Linda is torn between her intellectual feminist ideology, which eschews traditional male-female roles (even for lesbians), and her strong attraction for the boyish, ""politically incorrect"" Amy. Linda's roommates object to Amy, showing blatant hostility to Amy's nonconformity and her indifference to the feminist movement. Chloe Sevigny is quite a scene stealer as Amy, giving off an androgynous sexiness reminiscent of Elvis Presley or kd lang. The steamy lovemaking scenes are quite arousing, yet tastefully done and fitting with the story. Hair and costuming are especially superb, reminding me of my own high school days in the early 1970s. An underlying message in this story was the exposure of the ""nonconforming conformity"" of the feminist movement, which ultimately caused many lesbian feminists to break away.""2000"" is a cheerful, sweetly humorous, upbeat story about a lesbian couple wanting to have a baby. Even the lighting, costuming, and sets are bright and cheery, which sharply sets it apart from the previous two stories. Sharon Stone is delightfully daffy as Ellen's girlfriend and the Mother-to-Wanna-Be. Ellen DeGeneres acts too much like Ellen Morgan from her old sit-com. Apparently she hasn't gotten that character out of her system yet, or else Anne Heche did not give her much insight into the character. Speaking of Anne Heche, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see this story is obviously autobiographical-Sharon Stone as ""Fran"" (rhymes-with Anne!) is playing Heche, complete with Anne's hairstyle and ditsy personality. I like the positive portrayal of two caring women who love each other and their desire to have a child. Unfortunately, too much is borrowed from Ellen's old sit-com, resulting in an uneven movie that vacillates between light comedy and downright dumbness. The lovemaking scenes are contrived and appear to be an afterthought-I didn't think they added much to the story at all. DeGeneres looked especially uncomfortable in these scenes, keenly aware that Heche was watching every move she made. While there was definite sexual chemistry and spontaneity between Williams and Sevigny in their lovemaking scenes, Stone's and DeGeneres' lovemaking looked choreographed and rehearsed.Still, in spite of the flaws of the last story, this film is a must-see for everybody.

Not only did &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; by Virginia Woolf influence him linearly, but so did this film, clearly.I saw &quot;The Hours&quot; first, now this and it features three stories throughout time that happen to occur in the same house. I didn't make the full connection until I saw Vanessa Redgrave and then I remembered her performance as Mrs. Dalloway.I am most interested in how the stories are told, although not in a single day like &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; or &quot;The Hours&quot;, yet I can't help but feel that this piece had a tremendous amount of influence over the style.Chloe` is beyond beauty in this film as well as in the film &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;, except it was interesting to first see her in that movie as a very feminine woman, and in this one as the butch. She has a soft seductiveness either way that is extremely spell binding and captivating. I don't think I've ever seen a woman on screen so able to arouse with her silence and gentleness.Vanessa Redgrave also has such elegance, even in her grief, that her words and manner wins your heart just like she did in her other film as the character Mrs. Dalloway.Sharon Stone injects new hope into lesbians with her vivacious character who just is *so* in love with the witty Ellen Degenerous. The love scene between the two was a bit over powering, seeing Sharon in that position, I can only surmise what Ellen herself must have felt like during the filming. I'll bet when she got home Anne had some questions for her!I wondered, in hindsight, if those love scenes may have egged on Anne's stressful change of life? The fear of possibly &quot;psychologically&quot; or &quot;emotionally&quot; losing Ellen may have triggered her episode and created such anxiety and distress for her internally, exposing her fear of losing the one true love of her life. Seeing this, I feel it may have caused the entire collapse of their relationship and her sanity temporarily as other doors began to close, squeezing her out.

551420,A1GYR0Q9BRCNQ4,B00004U104,slkx,"[8, 9]","I bought this on DVD only a few days ago and it is still on my mind ... pieces from all three segments come to haunt me when I least suspect it.For instance, the indomitable Vanessa Redgrave, here, so tender and fragile, being told at a hospital by a woman, whose husband has had a heart attack, how lucky she is that she (Vanessa) has never married, for she will &quot;never know the pain of losing a husband&quot;. Meanwhile Vanessa's character is in that exact pain that moment, as her lover of a lifetime lies in a bed dying. Worse, she is refused access to her, as she is not &quot;family&quot;.There was also the awful sight of seeing the next of kin later swoop in and seize upon Vanessa's love's worldly goods as though little more than fun trinkets they stumbled upon... It was a powerful opener. However this first segment was too hard to watch twice, and I doubt many people will want to see it more than once.The second part did not grab me so much, but I was too young for the '70s to see the feminist movement in its hey day, to see the women's groups distance themselves and grow fragmented from the lesbians, lest they were all tarred by the same brush. I never got to feel the pain where freedom meant not being too butch or too ... whatever... It meant fitting in &quot;just so&quot; or not fitting in at all. It was interesting in that horrifying sort of way of politics mingled with peer pressure.Chloe Sevigny was predictably cute as the adorable, mannishly attired seductress of the femme. It raised some very valid questions and pared back the layers to reveal the hypocrisy of many women during their fight for freedom. But it seemed to me to lack the power and richness, the heart, of the first segment. But not through lack of trying. And all the women in it gave it their all.The third segment, the much feted Ellen and Sharon Stone piece was what I bought this DVD for. If you are expecting Ellen to rise above her stand-up comic background and turn into a Meryl Streep, forget it. That's not her forte and never will be. She handles the comic elements brilliantly as always, but when expected to deliver a dramatic monologue to camera about how frustrated she is she can't get her girlfriend pregnant, her voice goes up an octave into the whiney zone, and I kept half expecting her to crack a joke, the way she might have on her TV show.Thus, for our pre-existing comedy expectations, and Ellen's lack of dramatic training, it could be argued she was awfully miscast in this segment.... Except for one very important thing: I doubt I'll ever see a more believable f/f sex scene from Hollywood than that of Ellen and Sharon, because for the first time in who knows how long, at least one of the actresses actually, gasp, looked like she knew what she was doing.Ellen was convincing in conveying the love. It came across as natural and beautiful instead of salacious and mere titillation for the menfolk, ala Basic Instinct, Sharon's other flick.And while Sharon was there to look good in this scene (mission accomplished -- and looking eerily like Anne Heche at times), it was actually Ellen who stole it, as she was breathtaking in her sincerity. (Heck her face was even flushed deep red -- as though from passion, or embarrassment, who can say. *g*)For this scene alone I recommend the DVD.

551421,A18CRS4FLVH5YW,B00004U104,"Star Sailor ""Worldwide Traveler""","[30, 32]","In a time where America is on the brink of breaking down the walls of segregation of gays and straights comes a movie that provides not only historical educational insight but also an entertaining and beautiful view of delicate and powerful relationships!  The first story is the most compelling of the three, Vanessa Redgrave gives a performance for the ages as a woman who loses her lover of fifty years only to endure an inappropriate battle with her dead lovers relatives.  Brilliantly executed and directed, it pulls on your heart strings and makes you think just how terribly prejudice people can be for no reason at all.  The second story is set in the confusing and often socialogically brutal early 70's featuring a group of lesbians fighting college campus politics.  Michelle Williams plays a confused young woman who falls for Chloe Sgveny at the opposition of her fellow lesbian friends.  It's not as emotional as the first presentation but it presents a good point on how people take someone too much at face value, losing sight of the soul they were in love with initially.  The third segment is kinda fun to watch simply because Sharon Stone is very relaxed with her role.  Ellen Degeneres doesn't fit the role she plays but I understand why she was in this.  The intensity of the movie fizzles with the last segment unfortunately and doesn't depict as strong of an issue as the first two segments.  Overall, considering this movie makes such a bold statement for homosexuals everywhere, it really makes you think a little bit about how future generations will continue to fight and change the way things are for gays and lesbians-making the world a better place for us all.",5,Outstanding Performances!,974160000,"11 14, 2000",2000,1690,"['time', 'where', 'America', 'brink', 'breaking', 'down', 'walls', 'segregation', 'gays', 'straights', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'historical', 'educational', 'insight', 'also', 'entertaining', 'beautiful', 'view', 'delicate', 'powerful', 'relationships', 'first', 'story', 'most', 'compelling', 'three', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'performance', 'ages', 'woman', 'who', 'lover', 'fifty', 'years', 'only', 'endure', 'inappropriate', 'battle', 'dead', 'lovers', 'relatives', 'Brilliantly', 'executed', 'directed', 'heart', 'strings', 'think', 'just', 'how', 'terribly', 'prejudice', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'reason', 'second', 'story', 'set', 'confusing', 'often', 'socialogically', 'brutal', 'early', '70', 'featuring', 'group', 'lesbians', 'fighting', 'college', 'campus', 'politics', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'confused', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'Chloe', 'Sgveny', 'opposition', 'fellow', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'not', 'as', 'emotional', 'first', 'presentation', 'good', 'point', 'how', 'people', 'take', 'someone', 'too', 'much', 'face', 'value', 'losing', 'sight', 'soul', 'were', 'love', 'initially', 'third', 'segment', 'kinda', 'fun', 'watch', 'simply', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'very', 'relaxed', 'role', 'Ellen', 'Degeneres', ""n't"", 'fit', 'role', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'intensity', 'movie', 'last', 'segment', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'depict', 'strong', 'issue', 'first', 'two', 'segments', 'Overall', 'considering', 'movie', 'bold', 'statement', 'homosexuals', 'everywhere', 'really', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'how', 'future', 'generations', 'will', 'continue', 'fight', 'change', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'gays', 'lesbians-making', 'world', 'better', 'place']",If These Walls Could Talk 2
551422,A2A1HDK1NXG1S2,B00004U104,"turtlex ""turtlex""","[1, 5]","Vanessa Redgrave won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her portrayal of an older lesbian in the first segment of this trilogy (taking place in the early 60's). However, it is not that segment, nor the much over-hyped Sharon Stone/Ellen Degeneres final segment that plays the best. It is the middle segment, starring a wonderful Michelle Williams (&quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;) and Chloe Sevigny (&quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;) who I believe really shine here. Thier portion of the trilogy takes place in the 70's during the feminist movement. It is kind and sweet and rings most true. I was most surprised by Michelle William's here - she did an amazing job. &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; does not do her justice as she's proven to be an excellent actress. Chloe Sevigny is always fun and interesting to watch, but I think Michelle Williams really steals her scenes and holds her own with this Indie favorite. Going back to comment on the opening segment where Vanessa Redgrave plays an older lesbian - Watching Venessa Redgrave is always a pleasure and she's wonderful here, as well. Perhaps it's the tone of the opening segment - it so lacks joy. Regarding the final story - Sharon Stone and Ellen Degeneres on the other hand - they don't fare so well. I'm not exactly comfortable with them sitting on the hood of thier car watching children play in a park, repeatedly. This would seem down-right creepy regardless of the gender of the couple. This third segment is the one that seems the less &quot;real&quot; or true. I was a tad disappointed that the DVD version had no additional footage or special features. All in all - this film is worth viewing, but I doubt it would be something you'd watch again and again. You're likely to view your favorite segment more than once, but not the entire thing. My favorite segment was the center one.
