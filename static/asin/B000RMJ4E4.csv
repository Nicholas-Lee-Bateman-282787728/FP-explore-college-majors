The photography (even though it looks like it came from a cheaper camera) is great.  Production design (what little there is) is great.  It may be low-budget, but everything looks professional.*The acting is great; the bad guy is menacing, the tormented girl is convincing and shows great strength of character.  The characters are a little deeper than you would otherwise find in a horror film.*The woods are used effectively as a setting; ""Deliverance"" could eat its heart out.*Good music (some of which is by the band Mortiis!).The Bad Things*Not for the squeamish; especially the first half-hour.*They never show how the woman got captured in the first place (it looked like the scene was ultimately deleted).*Lots of screaming in some parts, which may be seen as irritating.The Questionable Things*A few parts where the main character hesitates too much.  It makes you want to shout at her ""Hurry up and kill the guy already!!!"" Then again, it can be seen as suspenseful.*The ending, although unexpected, is also brutal and leaves you feeling a little upset (or maybe a lot upset...).Considering that this film was made in the backwoods of England for a mere $5000.00 or so, this film is very well-made.  It is harrowing and intense.  It tells a simple story, but has a good group of characters and their plight is believable.  I think this is one of the better hardcore horror films, and would gladly reccomend it to anybody who can stomach it.Most of the film has pretty good video quality (except for one scene in the beginning which looked a little fuzzy), and okay audio.

Made on an extremely low budget, it looks as good as / better than most of what is cranked out today. The story is simple and agonizingly well realized. However, this is about more than just a maniacal captor (Eric Colvin) and the treatment of his captive, named Hope (Nadja Brand). This is about the undying love of a mother for her daughter, and the incredible ordeals she will endure in hopes of seeing her child again. We are put in the chains and subjugated along with mum, never knowing what new horror might come next. My favorite part is when Hope finds a flower. It is the only beauty in an otherwise blighted environment. The man destroys the flower once, but Hope will not allow him to do it a second time. When another young woman is brought into the desolate camp, things get even more interesting, as she is the innocent, new fish to Hope's more hardened, experienced victim. This allows for terrifying brutality, as well as the only brief moment of humor (the potato incident). BROKEN is not for anyone who must have a happy ending at all cost. I myself am no fan of the end of this movie, as it is the final, heart-destroying insult.

Not sure how she got there, she's just there.  Man, talk about freaky!  After a day of inconceivable fear and frantic attempts, she breaks free only to realize she's in the middle of the woods.  Her sadistic captor is there waiting with one sick agenda--break her spirit.  What follows next is a series of the most gruesome tortures, some sick depravity that is incredibly hard to watch.Yes, it makes SAW look like HEEHAW.  The harsh bloody events grate on your mind and turn your soul into shredded cheese.  Brooootal.This movie is extremely effective in pulling you in to this of vortex of isolation and unspeakable cruelty.  It touches on the effect of the prolonged desperation and victimization, Stockhom Syndrome kicking in.FINAL GRADE 3.5 StarsA great job by the director, however the extended brutality is bound to offset many viewers.

It's one of those movies that I've been hearing and reading about forever but seemed to never get an official release date... well, thanks to Dimensions new EXTREME (gotta go caps... it is EXTREME after all) DVD line it has been brought across the pond from the UK and released to the masses.  Broken is torture horror in it's most base form (although it does attempt some depth, for instance; our heroine is named Hope... yeah, that's a groaner) with any genuine tension or scares replaced with scenes of depravity and cruelty.  These setpieces are all done incredibly well and were pretty uncomfortable to watch even for a seasoned horror fan like myself, oddly enough though; there really aren't too many, especially after the first 20 minutes or so which show nearly the same scene (just happening to a different victim) right after the other?!  The production values, including the music, camera work, cast, and effects all seem far above the miniscule budget that they had to make this with, which if you watch allot of direct to DVD horror dreck you can certainly appreciate.  Although unoriginal and unscary, Broken did succeed at keeping my attention, even after 1 a.m. while being half in the bag... I guess that's gotta be worth something right!?  So a solid independent effort that offers enough to warrant a watch but not quite enough to buy for the collection (though the packaging is incredibly slick with a picture of a womans stomach with stitches across the middle that you can pull apart to reveal a razorblade mixed with her intestines... yep it's as gross as it sounds!).",2,Anyone else tired of the whole torture sub-genre?,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,1721,"['liked', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'more', 'importantly', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'borrows', 'one', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hearing', 'reading', 'forever', 'seemed', 'never', 'get', 'official', 'release', 'date', 'well', 'thanks', 'Dimensions', 'new', 'EXTREME', 'got', 'ta', 'go', 'caps', 'EXTREME', 'DVD', 'line', 'been', 'brought', 'pond', 'UK', 'released', 'masses', 'Broken', 'torture', 'horror', 'most', 'base', 'form', 'attempt', 'depth', 'instance', 'heroine', 'named', 'Hope', 'yeah', 'groaner', 'genuine', 'tension', 'scares', 'replaced', 'scenes', 'depravity', 'cruelty', 'setpieces', 'are', 'done', 'incredibly', 'well', 'were', 'pretty', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'even', 'seasoned', 'horror', 'fan', 'oddly', 'enough', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'especially', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'show', 'nearly', 'same', 'scene', 'just', 'happening', 'different', 'victim', 'right', 'other', 'production', 'values', 'including', 'music', 'camera', 'work', 'cast', 'effects', 'seem', 'far', 'miniscule', 'budget', 'had', 'make', 'watch', 'allot', 'direct', 'DVD', 'horror', 'dreck', 'can', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'unoriginal', 'unscary', 'Broken', 'did', 'succeed', 'keeping', 'attention', 'even', '1', 'a.m.', 'being', 'half', 'bag', 'guess', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'worth', 'something', 'right', 'solid', 'independent', 'effort', 'enough', 'warrant', 'watch', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'buy', 'collection', 'packaging', 'incredibly', 'slick', 'picture', 'womans', 'stomach', 'stitches', 'middle', 'can', 'pull', 'apart', 'reveal', 'razorblade', 'mixed', 'intestines', 'as', 'gross']",N/A

I can't even qualify as fully seeing it. It was so abhorrent I couldn't watch it passed the 50-minute mark. I doubt I missed anything ground-breaking.The acting is some of the most dreadful, desperate attempts I've ever seen. It's no wonder both the actress (Nadja Brand) who played Hope and the nameless torturer (Eric Colvin) have never had any work after the production of this abomination. Hope is our story's protagonist, and during the oh-so tame ""torture"" scenes we're supposed to root for her, but literally all she does is whimper and bitch throughout the whole movie, and there is about three minutes of character development before she is captured so we don't even know her character to sympatheize with. Needless to say I was hoping she would die the most brutal way possible. I couldn't even bear to follow through to see if she got away or not. Here's to hoping she was burned alive or something.The antagonist says about 30 words throughout the film, and it's usually two- or three-word demands at Hope to 'wash this' or 'clean that'. I guess he lives in the woods that he holds Hope captive? We don't really know. We basically know nothing at all. Including who he is, why he tortures people, why he chose Hope, how he captured her, what the point of sewing a razor into her stomach was, and why the hell he insists on wearing this ugly hat. It really isn't menacing at all. In fact, there's nothing menacing about him. He is contrived, utterly cheesy, generic and completely baseless. If Hope were to get away in the movie, the only good thing that would come of it would be she would probably kill this guy. It's too bad they both weren't being tortured.The gore that there is is nice, I will give it that. The setting is pretty nice-looking as well.

1082602,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000RMJ4E4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[21, 23]","I was watching the previews on the DVD for ""Black Sheep"" when the trailer for ""Broken"" came on.  In that week's rentals I had a film called ""Broken,"" but it was an Indie film starring Heather Graham and Jeremy Sisto and not this film, which turns out to be another example of the torture porn horror film, albeit with pretensions.  What is interesting is that that both ""Broken"" films came out in 2006 and that apparently both have just been released on DVD in the past month.  This brings to mind the possibility that somebody would recommend the Heather Graham ""Broken"" and rent this one by mistake (Don't laugh, I recommended the Academy Award winning ""American Beauty"" to a co-worker once and they went to the video store and picked up ""American Pie"" and could not figure out why anybody would give Jason Biggs and the gang the Oscar).  But the thought of people watching the wrong ""Broken"" was enough to make me check the other one out to see how much damage could be done to the psyche of some unsuspecting soul.At the start of the film a title card informs us that ""The slave girl is reared in an atmosphere of fear.""  The quote is from Harriet A. Jacobs (1813-1897), an American abolitionist who wrote the 1861 book ""Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.""  Written and directed by the tag team of Simon Boyes and Adam Mason, this movie is about Hope (Nadja Brand), a woman who puts her young daughter to bed one night and wakes up trapped in a coffin-like box.  We know from the opening scene of the film that whatever is about to happen to Hope has happened to another woman, who clearly has been pushed beyond her limits.  Consequently, given the Jacobs quote the implication is that the title of this horror film has to do with a woman's broken spirit.  However, in the final analysis most of what gets broken here is physical rather than spiritual.Hope is being held in the forest by a man (Eric Colvin), whose goal in dragging women out there is not to torture, rape, and kill them, but to help them get their minds right to being his domestic slave (unless the tending the garden bit is supposed to reference ""Candide"" in some way I have not yet figured out).  So when his victims are required to use a pointed stick to open up an incision in their abdomens while bound by the neck to a tree while balanced on a perch nailed several feet off the ground, it might involve blood (and sometimes guts), but it is not torture but a test.  One of several as the man attempts to break Hope.  But unlike previous victims, who have not worked out as the man has intended, Hope has something to hang on to: the possibility that her daughter is still alive.This is a low budget film and if you go through the DVD's special features you will find out that Boyes and Mason came up with the script as something that they could afford to film: if you shoot in the forest you do not have to worry about building sets and if one of you is married (at the time) to the lead actress that explains how you get somebody to make a movie like this when you are shooting outdoors in England during the winter.  If the movie delivered more of what it promised, it would have gone over better with me, especially given that opening quote which put me in a particular frame of mind.  ""Broken"" is different from most splatter flicks in that it takes place over several weeks, which is appropriate to the psychological dimension.  Just do not expect to understand how this nut gets his victims out there in the first place, because that is not part of the game here.For all of its shortcomings, the end game of ""Broken"" is probably the best part of the movie.  What happens to Hope and the man, respectively, struck me as being different and quite possibly original for this type of genre, and I ended up rounding up on the movie because of that (usually the ending of a splatter flick is the weakest part, especially when they contrive some stupid way for the killer to get killed).  There are other decent parts of the film as well: the parts that are suppose to revulse you in this movie do so, the cinematography does not look low-budget, and there were several nice cuts to good effect, so this is not a case of just wallowing in blood and gore.  ""Broken"" is not the torture porn film its trailer makes it out to be, but there is enough here to recommend checking it out.",4,"The man who is holding Hope captive wants to break her, not kill her",1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,4362,"['was', 'watching', 'previews', 'DVD', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'when', 'trailer', 'Broken', 'came', 'week', 'rentals', 'had', 'film', 'called', 'Broken', 'was', 'Indie', 'film', 'starring', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'not', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'example', 'torture', 'porn', 'horror', 'film', 'pretensions', 'What', 'interesting', 'Broken', 'films', 'came', 'out', '2006', 'apparently', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'past', 'month', 'mind', 'possibility', 'somebody', 'would', 'recommend', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Broken', 'rent', 'one', 'mistake', 'Do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'recommended', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'American', 'Beauty', 'co-worker', 'once', 'went', 'video', 'store', 'picked', 'up', 'American', 'Pie', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'anybody', 'would', 'give', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'gang', 'Oscar', 'thought', 'people', 'watching', 'wrong', 'Broken', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'check', 'other', 'one', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'damage', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'psyche', 'unsuspecting', 'start', 'film', 'title', 'card', 'slave', 'girl', 'reared', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'quote', 'Harriet', 'A.', 'Jacobs', '1813-1897', 'American', 'abolitionist', 'who', 'wrote', '1861', 'book', 'Incidents', 'Life', 'Slave', 'Girl', 'Written', 'directed', 'tag', 'team', 'Simon', 'Boyes', 'Adam', 'Mason', 'movie', 'Hope', 'Nadja', 'Brand', 'woman', 'who', 'young', 'daughter', 'bed', 'one', 'night', 'up', 'trapped', 'coffin-like', 'box', 'know', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'happen', 'Hope', 'happened', 'woman', 'who', 'clearly', 'been', 'pushed', 'limits', 'Consequently', 'given', 'Jacobs', 'quote', 'implication', 'title', 'horror', 'film', 'do', 'woman', 'broken', 'spirit', 'However', 'final', 'analysis', 'most', 'what', 'broken', 'here', 'physical', 'rather', 'spiritual.Hope', 'being', 'held', 'forest', 'man', 'Eric', 'Colvin', 'goal', 'dragging', 'women', 'not', 'torture', 'rape', 'kill', 'help', 'get', 'minds', 'right', 'being', 'domestic', 'slave', 'tending', 'garden', 'bit', 'supposed', 'reference', 'Candide', 'way', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'figured', 'out', 'So', 'when', 'victims', 'are', 'required', 'use', 'pointed', 'stick', 'open', 'up', 'incision', 'abdomens', 'bound', 'neck', 'tree', 'balanced', 'perch', 'nailed', 'several', 'feet', 'ground', 'might', 'involve', 'blood', 'sometimes', 'guts', 'not', 'torture', 'test', 'One', 'several', 'man', 'break', 'Hope', 'previous', 'victims', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'worked', 'out', 'man', 'intended', 'Hope', 'something', 'hang', 'possibility', 'daughter', 'still', 'alive.This', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'go', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'Boyes', 'Mason', 'came', 'up', 'script', 'something', 'could', 'afford', 'film', 'shoot', 'forest', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'worry', 'building', 'sets', 'one', 'married', 'time', 'lead', 'actress', 'how', 'get', 'somebody', 'make', 'movie', 'when', 'are', 'shooting', 'outdoors', 'England', 'winter', 'movie', 'delivered', 'more', 'what', 'promised', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'over', 'better', 'especially', 'given', 'opening', 'quote', 'put', 'particular', 'frame', 'mind', 'Broken', 'different', 'most', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'place', 'several', 'weeks', 'appropriate', 'psychological', 'dimension', 'Just', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'understand', 'how', 'nut', 'victims', 'out', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'not', 'part', 'game', 'shortcomings', 'end', 'game', 'Broken', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'What', 'Hope', 'man', 'respectively', 'struck', 'being', 'different', 'quite', 'possibly', 'original', 'type', 'genre', 'ended', 'up', 'rounding', 'up', 'movie', 'usually', 'ending', 'splatter', 'flick', 'weakest', 'part', 'especially', 'when', 'contrive', 'stupid', 'way', 'killer', 'get', 'killed', 'are', 'other', 'decent', 'parts', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'parts', 'are', 'suppose', 'revulse', 'movie', 'do', 'so', 'cinematography', 'not', 'look', 'low-budget', 'were', 'several', 'nice', 'cuts', 'good', 'effect', 'not', 'case', 'just', 'wallowing', 'blood', 'gore', 'Broken', 'not', 'torture', 'film', 'trailer', 'out', 'be', 'enough', 'here', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

1082605,A1B418FXSTSSMT,B000RMJ4E4,Music Lover.,"[1, 3]","Great setting throughout, beautiful woodland, or so it seems, apparently it was just a thicket, as explained on the extras on the dvd, which is kind of sad really, making it seem as though nowhere in the UK can you find a really secluded woodland that is actually far away from a road! Anyhow, to get to the movie's story, it was a shame they deleted the scene showing the woman driving her car with her daughter present also, and the man turning up in the middle of the road, making her stop the car, as it is it makes it seem as though she must have gone to bed and woken up in a box in the woods. It's only when watching the documentary on the dvd that one realises what actually happened.I would have preferred it if the story had been centred around the first woman, rather than the character of Hope, I found her intensely irritating in the scenes in the restaurant with her 'date' where she was acting in a cringe-making coquettish manner, and even worse back in her home with her tell-all mentality giggling with her girlfriend who had babysat her kid. Her character started off by being such an irritating, silly woman, that it was hard to feel any sympathy for her character or to care much about what happened to her. As the movie progressed though, I did warm to her a little more, but not much, her acting seemed rather contrived and not exactly believable, but apart from that, I very much enjoyed the movie, I thought the hiding of a certain object inside people's bodies (which they have to dig out to enable escape) was similar to in the ""Saw"" movie, but this film was way, way better than ""Saw"" in my opinion, far more entertaining, and unlike ""Saw"", this was very visually beautiful to look at, owing to the lovely woodland setting.According to the interview on the extras, they made the movie for somewhere between eight and ten thousand pounds. Incredibly low budget and therefore all the more praise necessary to the cast and crew and makers for achieving such a good piece of work but I guess having such a beautiful setting helped a lot here!I was absorbed all through, even allowing for Hope's annoying behaviour in the restaurant.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 3]","I put off seeing Broken for a long time, namely due to the fact that as much as I love horror films, I just can't get into the whole torture thing, and for the most part, never have.  It isn't the gore or violence that bothers me about the genre, it's just that many of these flicks just present sadism for the sake of being sadistic with little to no other kind of elements thrown in.  I knew what I was getting into with Broken, but there was something about it that made it worth a look, and needless to say, Broken delivers in terms of sadistic violence, and delivers even more so in its DVD cover proclamation that it makes the Saw films look like children's fare.  Nadja Brand stars as a mother who wakes up to find herself buried inside a box, and soon enough, comes face to face with her abductor (Eric Colvin) who seeks to completely break her.  What follows are some purely vile moments that will make you cringe like most horror flicks only wish they could.  What little suspense there is just isn't here enough, and were it more present, Broken would have benefited all the better for it.  Still, the film does manage to pick up as it reaches its grim denouement, which just may in fact leave you infuriated.  Brand comes off as annoying, while Colvin is chilling, and the gore effects are effective.  What may be the most notable thing about Broken is that writers/directors Adam Mason and Simon Boyes made this film with basically no budget, and having the lush wilderness as a backdrop added to the atmosphere.  Other than those qualities though, Broken is a film that I just couldn't really get into.

I concur.  This one is simply...EXTREME!!!!!!!!!!!!!But I must admit, I have never been more frustrated with the ""kindness"" of a female star in a vengefeul film than the one in this shocker.  I think I'm garnering a passing grade in Demented 101, only because the leading lady had a perfect opportunity to slice and dice the psychotic bozo in this film and she didn't have the bal...s (if you get my drift).  Maybe that's why they call them women.Trust me, I've met many aggressive women in my life (married three of them)...maybe that's my homework assignment in Demented 101????

1082609,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000RMJ4E4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Broken (Simon Boyes and Adam Mason, 2006)I've watched a depressing number of movies today that have scenes which can only be called unapologetic filler. In the same vein, there were points during Broken that gave me the idea that the entire movie was filler. This is a movie that wanted to be an absorbing look at Stockholm Syndrome through the filter of the Splat Pack (and the Wolf Creek influence is writ large here), but we never connect with the characters enough to make it gripping. The story itself is not enough; we need the people in the story to be people we want to spend time with (either because we sympathize with them or because they repulse us, either will do). That is not the case here.We start out with Hope (The Devil's Chair's Nadja Brand) out on a date with a guy (Eric Colvin, whose entire film career has been working with Adam Mason) who seems like the perfect date; he's courteous, he's a listener, he knows all the right things to do to make Hope think she's the only woman in the world, or so it would seem listening to her gush to a friend after she gets home. All well and good... until she wakes up tied to a tree, her daughter missing and her needing to injure herself quite radically in order to (she assumes, and we with her) avoid ending up like the corpse on the tree facing her. Okay, so maybe the guy wasn't all snips and snails and puppy dog tails...Both Brand and Colvin actually do a passable job here (though Abbey Stirling, who plays a third main character introduced halfway through, is somewhat less accomplished), so there's no blaming them for the mess that Broken ends up being. No, for that we have to go to the script, written by Boyes and Mason, who also collaborated on The Devil's Chair. I liked that one, but I liked it for its silliness and willingness to go over the top and parody itself when the material called for it; Broken has no such aspirations. It takes itself deadly seriously, and that is ultimately its downfall. Some humor, however black, would have been entirely welcome to mask the fact that Boyes and Mason, as many filmmakers confronted with overly difficult material do, simply gloss over the really important parts of this story--the events that would actually cause a captive to start siding with her captor. We get this story in snatches, and the events that we need to see to make this movie really worth are time are all happening in between those snatches. It's deadly frustrating, and it's the main reason I had that feeling I mentioned above, that the entire film is actually filler rather than movie. A great disappointment, this one. * ",2,Unnecessary.,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,2621,"['Broken', 'Simon', 'Boyes', 'Adam', 'Mason', '2006', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'depressing', 'number', 'movies', 'today', 'have', 'scenes', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'unapologetic', 'filler', 'same', 'vein', 'were', 'points', 'Broken', 'gave', 'idea', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'filler', 'movie', 'wanted', 'be', 'absorbing', 'look', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome', 'filter', 'Splat', 'Pack', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'influence', 'writ', 'large', 'here', 'never', 'connect', 'characters', 'enough', 'make', 'gripping', 'story', 'not', 'enough', 'need', 'people', 'story', 'be', 'people', 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'sympathize', 'repulse', 'either', 'will', 'do', 'not', 'case', 'here.We', 'start', 'Hope', 'Devil', 'Chair', 'Nadja', 'Brand', 'out', 'date', 'guy', 'Eric', 'Colvin', 'entire', 'film', 'career', 'been', 'working', 'Adam', 'Mason', 'who', 'perfect', 'date', 'courteous', 'listener', 'right', 'things', 'do', 'make', 'Hope', 'only', 'woman', 'world', 'would', 'seem', 'listening', 'gush', 'friend', 'home', 'well', 'good', 'up', 'tied', 'tree', 'daughter', 'missing', 'needing', 'injure', 'quite', 'radically', 'order', 'avoid', 'ending', 'up', 'corpse', 'tree', 'facing', 'Okay', 'so', 'maybe', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'snips', 'snails', 'puppy', 'dog', 'tails', 'Brand', 'Colvin', 'actually', 'do', 'passable', 'job', 'here', 'Abbey', 'Stirling', 'who', 'third', 'main', 'character', 'introduced', 'halfway', 'somewhat', 'less', 'accomplished', 'blaming', 'mess', 'Broken', 'up', 'being', 'No', 'have', 'go', 'script', 'written', 'Boyes', 'Mason', 'who', 'also', 'collaborated', 'Devil', 'Chair', 'liked', 'one', 'liked', 'silliness', 'willingness', 'go', 'top', 'parody', 'when', 'material', 'called', 'Broken', 'such', 'aspirations', 'deadly', 'seriously', 'ultimately', 'downfall', 'humor', 'however', 'black', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'welcome', 'mask', 'fact', 'Boyes', 'Mason', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'confronted', 'overly', 'difficult', 'material', 'do', 'simply', 'gloss', 'really', 'important', 'parts', 'story', 'events', 'would', 'actually', 'cause', 'captive', 'start', 'siding', 'captor', 'get', 'story', 'snatches', 'events', 'need', 'see', 'make', 'movie', 'really', 'worth', 'are', 'time', 'are', 'happening', 'snatches', 'deadly', 'frustrating', 'main', 'reason', 'had', 'feeling', 'mentioned', 'entire', 'film', 'actually', 'filler', 'rather', 'movie', 'great', 'disappointment', 'one', '*']",N/A

He tries and breaks them down so they basically are just his his servants or sex slaves. The movie can run really slow in parts so do not expect a ton brutal gore. It does though offer a very good script with some really great and violent moments which helps the story along. Just be patient with this one it does pay off. Some of the gore in this movie is really harsh and very twisted stuff. I think though this movie more about the story and not the violence. In the end though it was a pretty dam good movie. Just be prepared for some long moments of dialogue because you have only two people in most of the movie. I would have given it five stars but it did get a little slow in parts but it has great acting violence and a great script.
