This movie made use of a double lens system for both camera and projector as opposed to the prior two-camera, two-projector system. A major innovation at the time. Technical innovation, however, can't save a weak movie.Obler was primarily a writer and it shows in this movie: lots of words, little action. The plot is basically good. I would like to see it remade with stronger actors, some CGI and a good director.As for the DVD itself, the 3-D doesn't translate well to DVD. I went to the premier of this move and the 3-D was very good. It just doesn't come across on the DVD. Still, if you're a fan of B movies, or 3-D, or just weird (and somewhat historic) stuff, this is the movie for you.Disclaimer: I had something (a very little something) to do with this movie and was actually on set (Obler's home, Eaglefeather, designed and built by Frank Lloyd Wright) for a couple of scenes.",2,This is  one of the all time bad movies,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,988,"['do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'was', 'Arch', 'Obler', 'second', '3-D', 'movie', 'first', 'being', 'Bwana', 'Devil', 'movie', 'made', 'use', 'double', 'lens', 'system', 'camera', 'projector', 'opposed', 'prior', 'two-camera', 'two-projector', 'system', 'major', 'innovation', 'time', 'Technical', 'innovation', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'weak', 'movie.Obler', 'was', 'primarily', 'writer', 'movie', 'lots', 'words', 'little', 'action', 'plot', 'basically', 'good', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'remade', 'stronger', 'actors', 'CGI', 'good', 'director.As', 'DVD', '3-D', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'DVD', 'went', 'premier', 'move', '3-D', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'DVD', 'Still', ""'re"", 'fan', 'B', 'movies', '3-D', 'just', 'weird', 'somewhat', 'historic', 'stuff', 'movie', 'you.Disclaimer', 'had', 'something', 'very', 'little', 'something', 'do', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'set', 'Obler', 'home', 'Eaglefeather', 'designed', 'built', 'Frank', 'Lloyd', 'Wright', 'couple', 'scenes']",The Bubble

Basically, you need to set it so that the blue portion of the 3D image matches the blue lens of your 3D glasses.As for the story, well, it was kinda weak, and very similar to the (as stated above) Twilight Zone episode where the couple wakes up, hungover, after a party in a strange town that seems to have no escape. Here, however, the characters get to the outskirts of town to find a clear wall/dome surrounding the city. I don't want to ruin anything here, so I will just say that the conclusion is really a let down, and very unclear at best.Very cheesy movie, only recommended for those who love 3D movies no matter WHAT the quality or plot.",3,duck!,999129600,"08 30, 2001",2001,766,"['ok', 'really', 'have', 'play', 'around', 'tv', 'color', 'adjustment', 'get', 'right', 'setting', '3D', 'effects', 'work', 'Basically', 'need', 'set', 'blue', 'portion', '3D', 'image', 'matches', 'blue', 'lens', '3D', 'glasses.As', 'story', 'well', 'was', 'kinda', 'weak', 'very', 'similar', 'stated', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'where', 'couple', 'up', 'hungover', 'party', 'strange', 'town', 'have', 'escape', 'Here', 'however', 'characters', 'get', 'outskirts', 'town', 'find', 'clear', 'wall/dome', 'surrounding', 'city', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'anything', 'here', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'conclusion', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'very', 'unclear', 'best.Very', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'only', 'recommended', 'who', 'love', '3D', 'movies', 'matter', 'WHAT', 'quality', 'plot']",The Bubble

It is a strange about someone putting a bubble an the earth and trapping things and people in it.

468850,A16XRPF40679KG,6305538328,Michael Dobey,"[1, 1]","I have this version and for green and red glasses the 3d is pretty good!  The film was shot in 3d back in 1966.  This dvd comes with the glasses and is now out of print. The movie is a low budget sci fi flick , but they really utilized the 3d for this one. Which was it's selling points to audience in 1966 and in it's 1977 re-release.  After that it vanished for years. As tv stations couldn't show it in 2d?  This year 2014 , KINO is releasing a restored version. 3d film archives restored the move , frame by frame basically.  It should be out by the summer. the story is about a group of people caught in a bubble. This was probably the inspiration for steven kings story , under the dome. which is now a sci fi tv show hit! season 2 comes out this summer.  The effects are from it's era but the 3d was and is startling! Those who have seen the test copy of the bubble 3d blu ray . say it's the best 3d they have seen, or near the top! so make sure you grab that one. screen archives has also released 'man in the dark 3d'  a 1953 limited edition 3d blu ray.  go to their website to buy one!  this dvd is worth owning for 3d collectors , but the blu ray is a must have when it gets here.",4,this is being restored and released on 3d blu ray in 2014.,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,1191,"['have', 'version', 'green', 'red', 'glasses', '3d', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '3d', 'back', '1966', 'dvd', 'glasses', 'now', 'print', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'sci', 'fi', 'flick', 'really', 'utilized', '3d', 'one', 'was', 'selling', 'points', 'audience', '1966', '1977', 're-release', 'vanished', 'years', 'tv', 'stations', 'could', ""n't"", 'show', '2d', 'year', '2014', 'KINO', 'releasing', 'restored', 'version', '3d', 'film', 'archives', 'restored', 'move', 'frame', 'frame', 'basically', 'should', 'be', 'out', 'summer', 'story', 'group', 'people', 'caught', 'bubble', 'was', 'probably', 'inspiration', 'steven', 'kings', 'story', 'dome', 'now', 'sci', 'fi', 'tv', 'show', 'hit', 'season', '2', 'out', 'summer', 'effects', 'are', 'era', '3d', 'was', 'startling', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'test', 'copy', 'bubble', '3d', 'blu', 'ray', 'say', 'best', '3d', 'have', 'seen', 'top', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'grab', 'one', 'screen', 'also', 'released', ""'man"", 'dark', '3d', '1953', 'limited', 'edition', '3d', 'blu', 'ray', 'go', 'website', 'buy', 'one', 'dvd', 'worth', 'owning', '3d', 'collectors', 'blu', 'ray', 'must', 'have', 'when', 'here']",The Bubble
468851,A3JN4BH7WTPE2O,6305538328,Michael Mcgee,"[3, 11]",i just got my anaglyphic two color version of the bubble i remember first seeing it as a 3d revival back in the eighties in polaroid 3d top bottom system at the forrest hill theator 4 now an alrenco it was really clear but unlike anaglyphic current version they removed the introduction and after 15 minutes the right eye version went to the left and left right causing the images back ground to pop out but the figures go in ward this corrected at th end in that version the mobile was not poping out  but recent dvd it did although color now muddy the begining titles in theator version was clear but dvd anaglyphic vesion the two colors could not block out double eye but ending titles were as spectacular as in polavision version the story could of been better if they didnt put that throwing at the camera gimmick and took some scenes from other 3d movies the can can dance from house of wax which should of been released in 3d on dvd by now the flower scene taken from kiss me kate which also should be in 3d on video by now the moving beer at bar and holloween mask night mare taken from 13 ghost  which by now the illusion o version should of been on dvd too but the story manages to stay intresting in spite of gimick today the idea of portraying a married pregnant women coming from a all night party in film to day would offend the conservative n middle road fashist that is it would be politically in correct against working class family since todays purpose of both indie and studio film makers is to appease the wealthy police millitary christianity and conservative middle road family values against other classes on film so the bubble is positively poltically incorrect at the time this pic was expressing lines more realisticly in some instances talked about issue at the time that most films of 66 was ignoring like discusssion of birth control i missed my pill ect and slang like stop ure bitching was more 70ish most films at that time avoided such discussion except for exploitation films of the time the medium close up and in 3d were good distance shots fair a distance shot does better in polaroid or stereoscopy or a view master than anagly  phics due to two color melding into back ground creating confusion to the mind i'm sure the suttle flicker subsequent field 3d is better but u got that slight flicker so nothings prefect not even poaroid but this version is worth owning,2,my review of the bubble,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,2403,"['i', 'just', 'got', 'anaglyphic', 'two', 'color',

It is easily the best 3d movie ever made, one of the few that didn't trivialise the depth effects and eeriness of 3d, but used to enhance an otherwise enthralling film. Technologically, no other 3d movie was ever so seamlessly and flawlessly made. Without the 3d however, this is still a great film, it has such a great creepy, mysterious feeling, and a deliberately paced build-up and denouement.

In fact, it calculates to about 2.50:1 which is wider than your basic Panavision film! Second, the running time is just over 90  minutes, not 112. Third, my copy is in a snapper case, not a  keepcase.Okay, I'll make a few comments. The 3D effect is not very good  - I've always had trouble with these red/blue 3D presentations - but it's a  lot better when viewed on a computer monitor than on a television for some  reason. The movie is interesting but there's not much payoff - they're  trapped in this bubble, we know there's something controlling the people  inside, but it's all situation and not enough conclusion.
