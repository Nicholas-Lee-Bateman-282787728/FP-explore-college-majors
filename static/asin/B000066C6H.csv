[Is this a failure of the generals?] Some of the troops suffer from the defensive mines. What can be accomplished by one airplane? The enemy broadcasts their propaganda about their ""just cause"" against colonialism. Dien Bien Phu falls, prisoners are led away to a prison camp (until the armistice). A jeep can't be started without its keys. [Hot wiring?] The Armistice leads to the release of the prisoners. They must pass through a decontamination process (lice, fleas, etc.). A ship will take them home. But there is a curfew on in Algeria. [The defeat in Algeria led to a revolt that later succeeded.] Their regiment is disbanded. The curfew keeps people indoors at night.Those who write slogans on a wall can be shot. Colonel Raspeguy returns to his Basque village and is greeted by the people. Later he attends a ceremony to honor a man killed in action. He talks to his widow. Can he get a new command? Will the Countess help? Most of the criticism about him is true. [Note how class affects rank and position.] His new command will be made up of rejects. The Colonel becomes friendlier with the Countess. Can he become a general? There is a training exercise using live ammunition! The only rule is"" don't die. They practice hand-to-hand combat with knives. Later the Colonel rejects some soldiers. Algerians paint slogans on buildings. The regiment drives on patrol, then halts. There is an ambush! The rebels fire down from a cliff upon the road beneath. Can they capture that machine gun? A flanking attack drives off the enemy. That machine gun was captured from the French!The regiment returns to the city. The Colonel complains to the Mayor. That serial number will be traced. A helicopter scouts the rugged hills. [Note the disguise of some of the rebels.] An experienced soldier is in charge. ""I don't give promises, I give orders."" They see a fire in the distance. A big landowner's family was slaughtered. Where are the farm workers? Who is leading the resistance? The regiment finds three slaughtered and mutilated soldiers. Men are killed in vengeance. [Wasn't this also done in Nazi occupied Europe?] They go to the next village. Can they catch the leader? Not if they disperse into the mountains. Can they roam freely by ignoring constitutional rights? [How does this relate to other places?] Captain Esclavier talks to an Algerian woman; what is in her bag? Bombs are used by civilians. Can they get the Police's confidential files? Yes. These records are reviewed by the army.A man is arrested, will he talk? Others are brought in for questioning. Aicha won't talk. A loud noise erupts! Captain Esclavier questions a suspect. ""Intensive interrogation"" brings results. Can they capture the leader of the rebels? The army moves out to find the arms shipment. The resistance plans an ambush. Firing begins on the army from a hillside. Mortars are used by both sides. [An assault on a fortified position?] A Sikorsky helicopter transports troops behind the enemy for a successful attack. [Note the used of submachine guns against riflemen.] ""We won, didn't we?"" The army holds a ceremony to praise the 10th Parachute Regiment and the high officers. Captain Esclavier returns to civilian life.The rebellion in Algeria went on until DeGaulle became President of France in 1960 and negotiated independence for Algeria. Army officers created a Secret Army Organization to try to assassinate him. They failed (their techniques were used against them).

701304,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000066C6H,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[6, 8]","One reviewer categorized Anthony Quinn, who's purported to have been in more Oscar winning movies than any other actor, as Hollywood's All Purpose Ethnic...I thought that was not only an humorous description, but also an accurate one, too...I really wasn't sure about the film Lost Command (1966), but given the praise posted, I decided to give it a chance, and I wasn't disappointed.  Based on a novel by Jean Lart&eacute;guy, the film was directed by Mark Robson (Peyton Place, Von Ryan's Express, Earthquake).  Starring in the film is Anthony Quinn (The Guns of Navarone, Lawrence of Arabia), Alain Delon (Scorpio), and George Segal (Fun with Dick and Jane).  Also appearing is Claudia Cardinale (The Professionals), Maurice Ronet (Three Rooms in Manhattan), and Mich&egrave;le Morgan (Joan of Paris).The film begins as the mid-20th century conflict between the French and the Vietminh guerrillas battling each other somewhere in Indo-China comes to a close, with Quinn, playing Lt. Col. Pierre Raspeguy, finding his relatively small band of fighters overrun and eventually captured.  Soon after they're deposited in a prisoner of war camp, an armistice is declared, and the men are released to return home.  This is when Raspeguy, who comes from humble beginnings, learns his unit has been disbanded, and is effectively out of a job.  The French command is hesitant to give him another as not only is he perceived as someone who's difficult to work with by his superiors (only when they give inane commands that will needlessly kill his men), but he's also looked down upon as an officer because he's not of noble blood, something that used to be a requirement for high ranking positions in the French Army.  Anyway, through some assistance, Raspeguy does receive a new command, that of a newly formed paratrooper division made up of volunteers and rejects from other units, and his first assignment is to return to Algeria to deal with a growing insurgency among the Muslim population (the Vietminh effectively threw off the yoke of French control, and now others are getting similar ideas), led by a former French officer (who's originally of Arab descent), who, incidentally, used to be under Raspeguy's command.  As Raspeguy and his men move in, the situation is far from ideal as not only do they have to find this well hidden and highly armed insurgency force, but they also have to deal with a sympathetic population (sympathetic to the rebels, not the French) and the conflict becomes increasing dirty as the rebels/terrorists use whatever means possible to push the French from their land (but that's not to say the French didn't resort to less than savory methods also).  Not only that, but Raspeguy also must face harsh scrutiny from his superiors, who, it seems, are looking for any reason to put him out of commission, so success is critical (they're less likely to prosecute a hero over a scapegoat), even if it means adopting some rather harsh tactics (secretly, though, I think they admire his ability to get `down and dirty').I think one of the many things I liked about this film is, while the story was fairly complex, it wasn't difficult to follow, and I think this stems from a strong sense of direction and an eye for details provided by Robson.  There may not be fluid and grace in how in how the story proceeds, but that probably comes from the desire to stay close to the source material rather than trying to appease a more general audience.  I did feel some of the melodramatic elements included felt a little out of place, but given some of Robson's previous films, it's not surprising their inclusion here.  The film has similarities to another film, released a year later, titled The Dirty Dozen, in that you have a band of misfits lead by a strong leader, forced to take on a very dangerous assignment, so I can't help but wonder if that film took a little from Lost Command.  The main difference between the two films, in my opinion, besides the obvious, is The Dirty Dozen presents the characters in terms of heroic types, and the audience develops a sense of empathy with them, while in Lost Command, there's not so much of that as we see the some very strong-armed tactics employed by Quinn and his group, tactics that many would probably view as unfavorable, therefore not developing any strong attachments to the core characters, but given what they were up against, who's to say what one would do in a situation like that, against an enemy willing to sacrifice all for their ideals.  There aren't really any strong heroes here, but men doing what they must to survive...anyway, I though Quinn did a really excellent job as Raspeguy, and I could actually believe he was not only an officer in the French army, but also a native of the country.  I wasn't sure how Segal (darkened face and all) would come off as an Arab, and there were times it was a bit hard to swallow, but overall I think he managed to pull it off.  And having Claudia Cardinale, as the sister of the independence movement's leader, in the film sure didn't hurt...yowsa.  I enjoyed how the film showed both sides of the conflict, the difficulties they faced, and the tactics employed.  I haven't seen The Battle of Algiers (1965), released a year earlier, but I have heard it deals with the same conflict, both films covering the historical aspects very well.The anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) picture on this DVD looks very sharp, and the 2-channel Dolby surround audio comes through clearly.  There are slim pickings with regards to special features as the only extras include a trailer for this film, along with another for The Guns of Navarone (1961).Cookieman108By the way, watch for an early appearance by Burt Kwouk as a Vietminh officer...most will remember him as Inspector Clouseau's manservant Cato Fong, from the Pink Panther series...Clouseau: You raving Oriental idiot!

701306,A3MAZM138KFVOW,B000066C6H,D. Blackdeer,"[48, 49]","Very good film released in 1966 based on Jean Larteguy's novel ""The Centurians"" with Anthony Quinn portraying the main character Lieutenant Colonel Raspeguy. The film opens with Raspeguy and his paratrooper battalion fighting to the bitter end at Dien Bien Phu in Indo China. Raspeguy with his surviving officers and soldiers are interned by the Viet Mihn forces and repatriated back to France.  Raspeguy loses his battalion, but later obtains command of the 10th Paratrooper Regiment that is activated for battle in Algeria against Arab guerrilla forces fighting for independence. Raspeguy recruits his trusted veterans and they train the regiment with lessons learned from their experiences in Indo China.  Raspeguy is the typical maverick; a hardcore soldier who runs operations his way.  His unconventional methods for weeding out terrorist factions and insurgent forces causes friction with the French senior command and government administration. He suffers a setback after his soldiers commit atrocities against local villagers in an area where several comrades were ambushed.  Raspeguy is under investigation and faces a second relief from command and possible imprisonment. Victory is his key to success and he pulls out all stops to defeat the terrorists and a large insurgent force led by one of his former officers who defected from France.Overall it's a very good film and an interesting subject with French paratroopers fighting guerrilla forces in Algeria. Good action scenes on small unit combat, though tame by today's movie standards.

It was released first but it has been overshadowed by the more popular epic for over 40 years. One of the problems it had was that the actual history regarding the Algerian fight for independence received the ""Hollywood"" treatment--complete with well-known actors and a ""Love Story"".THE LOST COMMAND (1966) was directed by Mark Robson, who had given us several powerful films 20 years earlier, like CHAMPION (1949), HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949), BRIGHT VICTORY (1951) and THE HARDER THEY FALL (1956). The year before COMMAND, he directed the fine war film, VON RYAN'S EXPRESS (1965). Robson, in the twilight of his career directed mainstream fluff like THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (1967), and EARTHQUAKE (1974).Anthony Quinn played Lt. Col. Pierre Raspeguy, a Basque peasant who rose in the ranks to a commander of paratroopers. We are introduced to him just as the Viet Minh are overrunning his company at the battle of Dien Bien Phu in Indo-China; soon to become Viet Nam. Emerging from a POW camp, Quinn loses his command.. We are treated to a back story scene as Raspeguy returned home for a visit to his family and his village. We see more than a trace of Alexis Zorba during those scenes. Soon in France, he is romancing a widowed Countess de Clairfons (Michelle Morgan), who cannot seem to resist his earthiness. Through her aristocratic intervention, he is offered another command of paratroopers, and sent into the fray in Algeria.Quinn was able to gather many of his old troops around him, including Alain Delon and Maurice Ronet. After arriving in Algeria, Raspeguy discovered that his primary advesary was a former officer of his in Indo-China, Lt. Mahidi (George Segal). Segal had to struggle a bit with the dark pancake make-up and the French accent, but generally he was effective. Claudia Cardinale played Aisha, Mahidi's sister, providing the love interest for Delon. She, too, although woefully miscast provided adequate eye candy.There are three large scale battle scenes in the movie, and they are handled very spectacularly. When the 10th Paratrooper Battalion arrived early one morning in the city of Algiers, declaring martial law -there are marvelous echoes and similarities to Pontecorvo's film. LOST COMMAND does serve as an interesting companion piece to BATTLE OF ALGIERS, for it deals a lot with the battles in the mountains, where historically much of the revolt actually happened. Then the FLN took to the city streets, and their terrorist bombings cajoled the international press into covering their struggle.",3,Lost in Shadow,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,2667,"['movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Spain', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'just', 'classic', 'Gillo', 'Pontecorvo', 'behemoth', 'THE', 'BATTLE', 'OF', 'ALGIERS', '1966', 'was', 'released', 'first', 'been', 'overshadowed', 'more', 'popular', 'epic', '40', 'years', 'One', 'problems', 'had', 'was', 'actual', 'history', 'regarding', 'Algerian', 'fight', 'independence', 'received', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', 'complete', 'well-known', 'actors', 'Love', 'Story', '.THE', 'LOST', 'COMMAND', '1966', 'was', 'directed', 'Mark', 'Robson', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'several', 'powerful', 'films', '20', 'years', 'earlier', 'CHAMPION', '1949', 'HOME', 'THE', 'BRAVE', '1949', 'BRIGHT', 'VICTORY', '1951', 'HARDER', 'THEY', 'FALL', '1956', 'year', 'COMMAND', 'directed', 'fine', 'war', 'film', 'VON', 'RYAN', 'EXPRESS', '1965', 'Robson', 'twilight', 'career', 'directed', 'mainstream', 'fluff', 'THE', 'VALLEY', 'THE', 'DOLLS', '1967', 'EARTHQUAKE', '1974', '.Anthony', 'Quinn', 'played', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Pierre', 'Raspeguy', 'Basque', 'peasant', 'who', 'rose', 'ranks', 'commander', 'paratroopers', 'are', 'introduced', 'just', 'Viet', 'Minh', 'are', 'overrunning', 'company', 'battle', 'Dien', 'Bien', 'Phu', 'Indo-China', 'soon', 'become', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'Emerging', 'POW', 'camp', 'Quinn', 'command..', 'are', 'treated', 'back', 'story', 'scene', 'Raspeguy', 'returned', 'home', 'visit', 'family', 'village', 'see', 'more', 'trace', 'Alexis', 'Zorba', 'scenes', 'Soon', 'France', 'romancing', 'widowed', 'Countess', 'de', 'Clairfons', 'Michelle', 'Morgan', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'resist', 'earthiness', 'aristocratic', 'intervention', 'offered', 'command', 'paratroopers', 'sent', 'fray', 'Algeria.Quinn', 'was', 'able', 'gather', 'many', 'old', 'troops', 'including', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'Maurice', 'Ronet', 'arriving', 'Algeria', 'Raspeguy', 'discovered', 'primary', 'advesary', 'was', 'former', 'officer', 'Indo-China', 'Lt.', 'Mahidi', 'George', 'Segal', 'Segal', 'had', 'struggle', 'bit', 'dark', 'pancake', 'make-up', 'French', 'accent', 'generally', 'was', 'effective', 'Claudia', 'Cardinale', 'played', 'Aisha', 'Mahidi', 'sister', 'providing', 'love', 'interest', 'Delon', 'too', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'provided', 'adequate', 'eye', 'are', 'three', 'large', 'scale', 'battle', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'handled', 'very', 'spectacularly', 'When', '10th', 'Paratrooper', 'Battalion', 'arrived', 'early', 'one', 'morning', 'city', 'Algiers', 'declaring', 'martial', 'law', 'are', 'marvelous', 'echoes', 'similarities', 'Pontecorvo', 'film', 'LOST', 'COMMAND', 'serve', 'interesting', 'companion', 'piece', 'BATTLE', 'OF', 'ALGIERS', 'lot', 'battles', 'mountains', 'where', 'historically', 'much', 'revolt', 'actually', 'happened', 'Then', 'FLN', 'took', 'city', 'streets', 'terrorist', 'bombings', 'cajoled', 'international', 'press', 'covering', 'struggle']",N/A

For one, the subject matter of France's wars in Algeria and Indochina is rarely covered in films to my knowledge.  The combat scenes and terrorist attacks are on the whole well shot in the picture.  Another thing that makes the film interesting is its lack of heroes.  The Vietmienh are depicted as radical Communists.

I say this because he has been used to play everything from American Indians to Arabs over the years! Here he plays a fairly conventional character modeled after the actaul charasmatic Marcel Biegeard, a French paratrooper. I would concur with the other reviews that its one of Quinn's better roles.The movie has plenty of action taking the viewer from the defeat of Dien Bien Phu to Algeria. The scenes in Algeria are less propagandistic than some portrayals, though I believe the French were a good deal more brutal than this movie shows.Again, the best features really are the combat scenes, and the depiction of how Quinn's character molds a solid and versatile combat unit able to take on terrorists in the mountains and the city. My question when watching this movie was why didn't the French show this kind of courage and determination in 1940 against the Germans when it would have really mattered? The movie conveys a subtle anti-French message toward colonialism at the end which does not come across very clearly. Reviewers have tended to pan it because of this, but that's no reason not to give this film a chance.Despite these minor quibbles this is still a unique film covering an exotic topic.  With increased American involvement in Afghanistan and elsewhere there's a lot of added interest here. The movie conveys quite well the difficulties of dealing with insurgents.

Following the end of the Indochina conflict with the disastrous defeat at Dien Bien Phu, French colonel Pierre Raspeguy are returned to France by their Vietminh captors, only Raspeguy discovers his regiment has been disbanded.  It isn't long before Raspeguy is offered another regiment, a new group of paratroopers made up of some old comrades and a group of rejects from other units.  Arriving in Algeria, Raspeguy's 10th Parachute Regiment must help to put down the Algerian fight for independence, only to discover the rebel leader is an old friend.  Not many movies have been made about the Algerian War so any take is interesting to see.  What stands out here are the top-notch action scenes, including a disastrous airborne drop to open the movie, an ambush by Algerian rebels, and the final firefight on a rocky mountainside.  Mark Robson's movie tries to show both sides of the story, and mostly succeeds, but what's memorable about this movie is the action from start to finish.By this point in his career an established star, Anthony Quinn leads the cast as Lt. Colonel Pierre Raspeguy, a career soldier given one more chance to make good, lead his inexperienced regiment in attempt to squash a rebellion.  Quinn brings just the right amount of world-weariness and need to accomplish his mission to make Raspeguy a very interesting character.  Alain Delon is Captain Phillipe Esclavier, an idealistic young soldier who becomes Raspeguy's close friend and second in command.  In a weird bit of casting, George Segal plays Mahidi, an Arab leader of the Algerian fight for independence who use to fight alongside the men now hunting him.  Michele Morgan is Countess Clairfons, a rich widow who recently lost her husband and starts to fall for Quinn, while the very beautiful Claudia Cardinale gets to play a villainous role as Aicha, Mahidi's sister who starts to play Delon.  Maurice Ronet leads Raspeguy's group of support as the cold-blooded Boisfeuras, along with Maurice Sarfati, Jean-Claude Bercq, Syl Lamont, and Gordon Heath.  Also look out for small parts for spaghetti western bit players Al Mulock and Aldo Sambrell.The DVD is a good buy, especially for the high quality widescreen presentation.  Filmed in Spain, the desert locations have never looked better.  Special features include a Lost Command trailer along with a Guns of Navarone trailer.  It's a movie that has flown under the radar all these years, but don't miss out on this chance to catch it on DVD.  Great action, and good performances from Quinn and Delon, check out Lost Command!",4,"Top-notch action with French paratroopers in Dien Bien Phu, Algeria",1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,2787,"['Made', 'same', 'year', 'Battle', 'Algiers', 'dealing', 'exact', 'same', 'subject', 'matter', 'Lost', 'Command', 'oft-forgotten', 'action', 'story', 'telling', 'story', 'Algerian', 'fight', 'independence', 'French', 'perspective', 'Following', 'end', 'Indochina', 'conflict', 'disastrous', 'defeat', 'Dien', 'Bien', 'Phu', 'French', 'colonel', 'Pierre', 'Raspeguy', 'are', 'returned', 'France', 'Vietminh', 'captors', 'only', 'Raspeguy', 'regiment', 'been', 'disbanded', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Raspeguy', 'offered', 'regiment', 'new', 'group', 'paratroopers', 'made', 'old', 'comrades', 'group', 'rejects', 'other', 'units', 'Arriving', 'Algeria', 'Raspeguy', '10th', 'Parachute', 'Regiment', 'must', 'help', 'put', 'down', 'Algerian', 'fight', 'independence', 'only', 'discover', 'rebel', 'leader', 'old', 'friend', 'Not', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Algerian', 'War', 'take', 'interesting', 'see', 'What', 'out', 'here', 'are', 'top-notch', 'action', 'scenes', 'including', 'disastrous', 'airborne', 'drop', 'open', 'movie', 'ambush', 'Algerian', 'rebels', 'final', 'firefight', 'rocky', 'mountainside', 'Mark', 'Robson', 'movie', 'show', 'sides', 'story', 'mostly', 'what', 'memorable', 'movie', 'action', 'start', 'finish.By', 'point', 'career', 'established', 'star', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'cast', 'Lt', 'Colonel', 'Pierre', 'Raspeguy', 'career', 'soldier', 'given', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'make', 'good', 'lead', 'inexperienced', 'regiment', 'attempt', 'squash', 'rebellion', 'Quinn', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'world-weariness', 'need', 'accomplish', 'mission', 'make', 'Raspeguy', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'Captain', 'Phillipe', 'Esclavier', 'idealistic', 'young', 'soldier', 'who', 'Raspeguy', 'close', 'friend', 'second', 'command', 'weird', 'bit', 'casting', 'George', 'Segal', 'Mahidi', 'Arab', 'leader', 'Algerian', 'fight', 'independence', 'who', 'use', 'fight', 'men', 'now', 'hunting', 'Michele', 'Morgan', 'Countess', 'Clairfons', 'rich', 'widow', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'husband', 'fall', 'Quinn', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Claudia', 'Cardinale', 'play', 'villainous', 'role', 'Aicha', 'Mahidi', 'sister', 'who', 'play', 'Delon', 'Maurice', 'Ronet', 'Raspeguy', 'group', 'support', 'cold-blooded', 'Boisfeuras', 'Maurice', 'Sarfati', 'Jean-Claude', 'Bercq', 'Syl', 'Lamont', 'Gordon', 'Heath', 'Also', 'look', 'out', 'small', 'parts', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'bit', 'players', 'Al', 'Mulock', 'Aldo', 'Sambrell.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'buy', 'especially', 'high', 'quality', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'Filmed', 'Spain', 'desert', 'locations', 'have', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'Lost', 'Command', 'trailer', 'Guns', 'Navarone', 'trailer', 'movie', 'flown', 'radar', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'chance', 'catch', 'DVD', 'Great', 'action', 'good', 'performances', 'Quinn', 'Delon', 'check', 'out', 'Lost', 'Command']",N/A
701327,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000066C6H,Trevor Willsmer,"[2, 3]","Mark Robson's ambitious Lost Command is one of those films that has all the right intentions and a formidable array of talent but doesn't quite get it right. It's bold subject matter for a Hollywood epic - the increasingly unwinnable French war to hold onto its colony in Algeria after their humiliating defeat at Dien Bien Phu led to them losing Vietnam, something even the French didn't want to see movies about - but in its need to make an unpalatable war palatable to a mainstream audience it never quite gets the balance right.Things start promisingly enough with the French flag being blown up and paratroopers landing in a minefield at Dien Bien Phu (a scene largely thrown away behind the opening credits) before being captured by the Vietnaminh and being released in disgrace. His regiment disbanded, Anthony Quinn's Colonel Raspeguy, a working class Basque soldier who worked his way up through the ranks but is still regarded as a useful animal and an even more useful scapegoat by his superiors, finds himself without a command unless he's willing to take a brigade of outcasts to Algeria to end the insurrection by any means necessary. Naturally, once there he discovers that the leader of the rebels is one of his former paratroopers while his two Captains take very different approaches to dealing with the locals as the atrocities on both sides start to escalate.Knowing his right-wing political views, Alain Delon is curious casting as the conscience of the film, the unit's military historian, though he has more to work with than Maurice Ronet's brutally pragmatic moral opposite number, but, not being able to tempt Omar Sharif to play the role, there's a disastrous bit of miscasting as the Algerian paratrooper-turned-FLN leader: George Segal with cocoa beans smeared on his face doing what sounds like Peter Sellers' Indian doctor routine before veering off into a bad Welsh accent. Still known as a dramatic actor at the time, he does his best but he's no more convincing as an Arab than Sharif was as a Nazi in Night of the Generals. You can only guess what Tunisian-born-and-raised Claudia Cardinale thought as his onscreen sister...As a retelling of then recent events, it covers most of the bases - the `Lizards' torture suspects and kill villagers in reprisals (albeit offscreen) while the rebels use women to bomb soft civilian targets - and it ends on a note of moral abdication from one character and a note of solidarity for the rebels from another (more in sympathetic thought than deed), but it's a film that seems as torn as Delon's character as to quite what it wants to be or believe in, falling into a no man's land as part old-fashioned studio war movie, part underdeveloped political/moral drama. The Spanish locations don't always convince, especially with the desert standing in for the jungles of Vietnam (complete with Cantonese-speaking Burt Kwouk as a Vietnaminh officer) while Franz Waxman's score veers more to the Spanish bullrings than the French legions or Algiers casbah. It's certainly a brave film to make in 1966, but compared to the power and immediacy of Pontecorvo's Battle of Algiers that's not quite enough to make it more than just worth a look.",3,Ambitious but compromised,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,3207,"['Mark', 'Robson', 'ambitious', 'Lost', 'Command', 'one', 'films', 'right', 'intentions', 'formidable', 'array', 'talent', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'right', 'bold', 'subject', 'matter', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'increasingly', 'unwinnable', 'French', 'war', 'hold', 'colony', 'Algeria', 'humiliating', 'defeat', 'Dien', 'Bien', 'Phu', 'led', 'losing', 'Vietnam', 'something', 'even', 'French', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'movies', 'need', 'make', 'unpalatable', 'war', 'palatable', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'never', 'quite', 'balance', 'right.Things', 'start', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'French', 'flag', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'paratroopers', 'landing', 'minefield', 'Dien', 'Bien', 'Phu', 'scene', 'largely', 'thrown', 'away', 'opening', 'credits', 'being', 'captured', 'Vietnaminh', 'being', 'released', 'disgrace', 'regiment', 'disbanded', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Colonel', 'Raspeguy', 'working', 'class', 'Basque', 'soldier', 'who', 'worked', 'way', 'up', 'ranks', 'still', 'regarded', 'useful', 'animal', 'even', 'more', 'useful', 'scapegoat', 'superiors', 'command', 'willing', 'take', 'brigade', 'outcasts', 'Algeria', 'end', 'insurrection', 'means', 'necessary', 'Naturally', 'once', 'leader', 'rebels', 'one', 'former', 'paratroopers', 'two', 'Captains', 'take', 'very', 'different', 'approaches', 'dealing', 'locals', 'atrocities', 'sides', 'start', 'escalate.Knowing', 'right-wing', 'political', 'views', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'curious', 'casting', 'conscience', 'film', 'unit', 'military', 'historian', 'more', 'work', 'Maurice', 'Ronet', 'brutally', 'pragmatic', 'moral', 'opposite', 'number', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'tempt', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'play', 'role', 'disastrous', 'bit', 'miscasting', 'Algerian', 'paratrooper-turned-FLN', 'leader', 'George', 'Segal', 'cocoa', 'beans', 'smeared', 'face', 'doing', 'what', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Indian', 'doctor', 'routine', 'veering', 'off', 'bad', 'Welsh', 'accent', 'Still', 'known', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'time', 'best', 'more', 'convincing', 'Arab', 'Sharif', 'was', 'Nazi', 'Night', 'Generals', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'what', 'Tunisian-born-and-raised', 'Claudia', 'Cardinale', 'thought', 'onscreen', 'sister', 'retelling', 'then', 'recent', 'events', 'most', 'bases', 'Lizards', 'torture', 'suspects', 'kill', 'villagers', 'reprisals', 'offscreen', 'rebels', 'use', 'women', 'bomb', 'soft', 'civilian', 'targets', 'note', 'moral', 'abdication', 'one', 'character', 'note', 'solidarity', 'rebels', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'thought', 'deed', 'film', 'as', 'torn', 'Delon', 'character', 'quite', 'what', 'be', 'believe', 'falling', 'man', 'land', 'part', 'old-fashioned', 'studio', 'war', 'movie', 'part', 'underdeveloped', 'political/moral', 'drama', 'Spanish', 'locations', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'convince', 'especially', 'desert', 'standing', 'jungles', 'Vietnam', 'complete', 'Cantonese-speaking', 'Burt', 'Kwouk', 'Vietnaminh', 'officer', 'Franz', 'Waxman', 'score', 'veers', 'more', 'Spanish', 'bullrings', 'French', 'legions', 'Algiers', 'casbah', 'certainly', 'brave', 'film', 'make', '1966', 'compared', 'power', 'immediacy', 'Pontecorvo', 'Battle', 'Algiers', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'make', 'more', 'just', 'look']",N/A

It is a shoot-em-up of interest to American audiences largely because of unfamiliarity with the French military re the closing days of the colonial period....The novel was one of the most important works of fiction re the military in the 20th Century.  It had a powerful message... none of which made it into the film.  Like Starship Troopers (the director could not be bothered to read the book all the way through... leaving out the core of History and Moral Philosophy... and going with fireworks and fascist uniforms instead) the core values and message have been gutted....Try your local library...The original work was ""The Centurions"" by Jean Larteguy... The book has been out of print and is quite expensive... Reading it will make you aware how with the cast and budget available this could have been a milestone film....The French paras (*not* Foreign Legion)were tough and proficient (the Israelis modeled their own paratroopers on them).  The French government during the entire Indochina war was either hopelessy inept, cowardly, or worse.  No draftees were sent to Indochina and the government and people ultimately kept the regulars at the sharp end for almost a decade without supporting them....The French establishment at the time viewed paras as adventurers, thugs, mercenaries... and it was always a scandal if an aristocratic young officer chose to serve with them....The trauma of Indochina in general and Dien Bien Phu in particular impacted the French para officers... Being held in a Viet Minh hellhole made it worse... But in the camps many of the officers picked up marxist methods... and made them their own... Self-criticism sessions... but with humor... Propaganda... but always truthful......These were used by a number of elite French units in Algeria.  The thinking was that the government was beneath contempt, so they would have the French people directly identify with them.  In the novel this involves getting miserable French draftees who had been sent to Algeria (legally part of France at the time) to volunteer for transfer to the paras... A fair nummber of the conscripts who choose to volunteer (for many reasons) are marxists... and are made welcome by the regimental commander... who uses their best talents and converts them into elite soldiers....The film ignores this... and simply shows regular paras... destroying the soul of the novel.  The move was both brilliant and dangerous.  A government that holds its military in contempt is eventually held in contempt by its military... While the methods were brilliant, the underlying idea of ignoring the government would ultimately lead to some of the French units staging a mutiny in Algeria....The military ""must be fit to fight... It is never fit to rule..."" (T.R. Feherenbach) The idiots with checkbooks were not interested in history or its lessons...YP",3,A handsomely mounted empty shell...,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,2976,"['have', 'go', 'S.', 'M', 'Darragh', 'one', 'film', 'handsomely', 'mounted', 'well', 'cast', 'nothing', 'say', 'shoot-em-up', 'interest', 'American', 'audiences', 'largely', 'unfamiliarity', 'French', 'military', 're', 'closing', 'days', 'colonial', 'period', '.The', 'novel', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'works', 'fiction', 're', 'military', '20th', 'Century', 'had', 'powerful', 'message', 'none', 'made', 'film', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'director', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'read', 'book', 'way', 'leaving', 'out', 'core', 'History', 'Moral', 'Philosophy', 'going', 'fireworks', 'fascist', 'uniforms', 'instead', 'core', 'values', 'message', 'have', 'been', 'gutted', '.Try', 'local', 'library', 'original', 'work', 'was', 'Centurions', 'Jean', 'Larteguy', 'book', 'been', 'print', 'quite', 'expensive', 'Reading', 'will', 'make', 'aware', 'how', 'cast', 'budget', 'available', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'milestone', 'film', '.The', 'French', 'paras', '*not*', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'were', 'tough', 'proficient', 'Israelis', 'modeled', 'own', 'paratroopers', 'French', 'government', 'entire', 'Indochina', 'war', 'was', 'hopelessy', 'inept', 'cowardly', 'worse', 'draftees', 'were', 'sent', 'Indochina', 'government', 'people', 'ultimately', 'kept', 'regulars', 'sharp', 'end', 'almost', 'decade', 'supporting', 'French', 'establishment', 'time', 'viewed', 'paras', 'adventurers', 'thugs', 'mercenaries', 'was', 'always', 'scandal', 'aristocratic', 'young', 'officer', 'chose', 'serve', '.The', 'trauma', 'Indochina', 'general', 'Dien', 'Bien', 'Phu', 'particular', 'impacted', 'French', 'para', 'officers', 'Being', 'held', 'Viet', 'Minh', 'hellhole', 'made', 'worse', 'camps', 'many', 'officers', 'picked', 'up', 'marxist', 'methods', 'made', 'own', 'Self-criticism', 'sessions', 'humor', 'Propaganda', 'always', 'truthful', 'were', 'used', 'number', 'elite', 'French', 'units', 'Algeria', 'thinking', 'was', 'government', 'was', 'beneath', 'contempt', 'would', 'have', 'French', 'people', 'directly', 'identify', 'novel', 'getting', 'miserable', 'French', 'draftees', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'sent', 'Algeria', 'legally', 'part', 'France', 'time', 'volunteer', 'transfer', 'paras', 'A', 'fair', 'nummber', 'conscripts', 'who', 'choose', 'volunteer', 'many', 'reasons', 'are', 'marxists', 'are', 'made', 'welcome', 'regimental', 'commander', 'who', 'best', 'talents', 'elite', 'soldiers', '.The', 'film', 'ignores', 'simply', 'regular', 'paras', 'destroying', 'soul', 'novel', 'move', 'was', 'brilliant', 'dangerous', 'government', 'military', 'contempt', 'eventually', 'held', 'contempt', 'military', 'methods', 'were', 'brilliant', 'underlying', 'idea', 'ignoring', 'government', 'would', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'French', 'units', 'staging', 'mutiny', 'Algeria', '.The', 'military', 'must', 'be', 'fit', 'fight', 'never', 'fit', 'rule', 'T.R', 'Feherenbach', 'idiots', 'checkbooks', 'were', 'not', 'interested', 'history', 'lessons', 'YP']",N/A
