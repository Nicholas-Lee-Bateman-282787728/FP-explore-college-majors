Some of the running gags didn't run, they sputtered.  In the opening of the show, when he chats with the audience you witness his remarkable lack of wit.  This show just never came together.  Interesting to see Steve Cobert in his earliest years.  Amazon reviewers tend to praise their topics, but truthfully this show is better suited to the high school age intellect.  Dana Carvey is a very likeable performer but this show exposes his weaknesses and may explain why the comedian never climbed to greater career heights.",2,Dana Carvey Show does not hold up,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,652,"['Gifted', 'comedian', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'attempted', 'regular', 'TV', 'series', 'bombed', 'impressions', 'George', 'Bush', 'Ross', 'Perot', 'fell', 'flat', 'running', 'gags', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'sputtered', 'opening', 'show', 'when', 'audience', 'remarkable', 'lack', 'wit', 'show', 'just', 'never', 'came', 'together', 'Interesting', 'see', 'Steve', 'Cobert', 'earliest', 'years', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'tend', 'praise', 'topics', 'truthfully', 'show', 'better', 'suited', 'high', 'school', 'age', 'intellect', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'very', 'likeable', 'performer', 'show', 'weaknesses', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'comedian', 'never', 'climbed', 'greater', 'career', 'heights']",The Dana Carvey Show

I regret feeling this way about the show, for while I always felt that Dana Carvey was vastly over-rated in terms of his versatility and the breadth of his talent, I nonetheless liked and still like him personally very much. And of course the program boasted the talents of Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert, among others. And there were a few moments of true humor that were either well-crafted or wonderfully offbeat -- the send up of the Beatles and Grandma the Clown, to name a couple -- with some postmodern celebrity deconstruction scattered here and there. In the end, however, too many of the skits were simply not funny. A few, such as the ethnic Oscars, are downright unfunny and offensive, in a bad way. And I won't even go into O.J.

1215879,A24MFKJNHJDVZF,B001LRL4XI,Mel Zorro,"[16, 16]","Within its first few minutes on air The Dana Carvey Show had already alienated the general ABC viewing audience, as then-president Bill Clinton (Carvey) opened his shirt to reveal his lactating, multi-nippled chest from which human babies and puppy dogs fed with glee.  The key word here is ""glee"", since that's what but a tiny percentage of the audience at home (i.e. a 14 year old me) felt as they busted a gut to this unprecedented absurdity from the man they had come to know as ""Garth"".For 13 years now, the few, the proud, the...criminally insane, have had to hold out hope as they watched worn out VHS copies of the show containing skits such as ""World Leaders and Their Baths"" for the 1,000th time, that someone, somewhere would employ Dana Carvey so that his fame would warrant a DVD release of his short-lived, 7 episodes of madness.Well, that didn't happen (Dana Carvey's return to the spotlight, I mean) but in an even bigger fluke formerly unknown castmates Steven Colbert and Steve Carell (if only he'd changed his name to STEVEN Carvey) have become national comedy superstars and thus we, the patient(and deranged) will soon be treated to a complete DVD set with a cover most likely featuring large graphics of Colbert and Carell with Carvey relegated to peaking out from behind their shoulders.  But personally, I'll take these episodes anyway I can get 'em.Classic skits like: ""Waiters Who Are Nauseated By Food"", ""Deleted Scenes from the Wizard of OZ"" and ""Academy Awards: Best Foreign Animated Short"" are sure to please the masses, but I for one can't wait to see the likes of ""Grandma The Clown"", Prince Charles singing Beatles-style about chopping Lady Di's head off and any skit featuring Bob Dole in all their digital glory.Whichever former sponsor(whether Mountain Dew or Szechuan Dynasty) forked out the dough for  the release of this DVD set I thank you, especially since this wonderful gift is being released on my Birthday.

1215882,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B001LRL4XI,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[2, 4]","Dane Cook gets a lot of grief for doing routines that every other comedian has mined better; yet, in the 1990s there were comedians who made Dane Cook look like George Carlin by comparison. Case in point - Dana Carvey. The man generated many good memories on Saturday Night Life creating the kinds of characters that people would imitate the next day, including Garth, Church Lady and Hanz or Franz. Yet, these same characters became the catalyst for the awful SNL of the mid-90s. They were lazy characters based on funny accents and catch phrases who weren't all that funny in the first place.That's not to say that Dana Carvey was the worst offender. Goat Boy was a terrible skit and the less said about ""It's Pat"" the better.But Dana Carvey had found praise and adulation doing things that weren't terribly funny. There was a comfort to his sketches in which people would hear it and they would feel warm nostalgia for five years ago when they first thought that the skit was funny. As Ricky Gervais pointed out in Extras, people respond to stupid comedy with lazy stereotypes and catch phrases. And you can make a lot of money with it for a long time.That still doesn't mean that it's any good.This show is advertised as the starting place for great comedians like Louis CK and Stephen Colbert as well as Steve Carroll and Louis Shimel (whose Saturday Evening FunHouse cartoons would be snapped up by SNL) but the sad part about that advertising is that it blatantly ignores the fact that Dana Carvey is front and center in all of his skits. The few moments of amusement happen when he's not in the skit (like ""Clown Grandma"") but even in these skits he is showing up to introduce the next bit in one of his many awful characters. Also, Louis CK was happy in the 90s which means that he was mildly amusing at best. He didn't become screamingly hilarious until the 00s when he mined his worst moments for uncomfortable laughs.If for some reason you still have fond memories of Hans and Franz or the Church Lady, by all means, by this DVD. You can also enjoy warmed over Ross Perot imitations and that same George Bush imitation that by this point only George Bush finds amusing. And if you want to see a sketch in which Bill Clinton nurses an animal - yeah, that's there - complete with Dana Carvey patting himself on the back for how ""edgy"" that skit was in the next episode. However, be warned that you might not find these skits as funny as you once did. Chances are you only thought these skits were funny because you were in college and stoned at the time (or in high school and bipolar). Most likely you will find them irritating and desperate - like the uncle who thinks that putting on a Chinese accent and saying ""Me so horny"" is the height of comedy.Oh and there is a skit in which broad ethnic stereotypes are nominated for academy awards. Poor Steve Carroll is stuck with the Indian stereotype while Dana Carvey enjoys the worst Asian stereotype hamming since Mickey Rooney put on buck teeth for Breakfast at Tiffanys. It's like that part of the Simpsons when Krusty the Clown tries to do comedy only to realize taht all of his routines are considered old and terrible.In many ways, that racist skit characterizes the entire show for me - overly broad, no comic sensibility and overt reliance on stereotypes and ""whacky"" catch phrases. I would feel bad for Dana Carvey (after all he once won fame and a ton of money doing this junk and got accustomed to it in the same way that the father from Long Day's Journey into Night grew comfortable with his big part) if I didn't just watch this show and hate him with every ""goofy"" accent.",1,Lazy Sketch Comedy from one of the laziest comedians around,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,3647,"['Dane', 'Cook', 'lot', 'grief', 'doing', 'routines', 'other', 'comedian', 'mined', 'better', 'yet', '1990s', 'were', 'comedians', 'who', 'made', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'look', 'George', 'Carlin', 'comparison', 'Case', 'point', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'man', 'generated', 'many', 'good', 'memories', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Life', 'creating', 'kinds', 'characters', 'people', 'would', 'imitate', 'next', 'day', 'including', 'Garth', 'Church', 'Lady', 'Hanz', 'Franz', 'same', 'characters', 'became', 'catalyst', 'awful', 'SNL', 'mid-90s', 'were', 'lazy', 'characters', 'based', 'funny', 'accents', 'catch', 'phrases', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'first', 'place.That', 'not', 'say', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'was', 'worst', 'offender', 'Goat', 'Boy', 'was', 'terrible', 'skit', 'less', 'said', 'Pat', 'better.But', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'had', 'found', 'praise', 'adulation', 'doing', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'funny', 'was', 'comfort', 'sketches', 'people', 'would', 'hear', 'would', 'feel', 'warm', 'nostalgia', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'thought', 'skit', 'was', 'funny', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'pointed', 'out', 'Extras', 'people', 'respond', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'lazy', 'stereotypes', 'catch', 'phrases', 'can', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'long', 'still', ""n't"", 'mean', 'good.This', 'show', 'advertised', 'starting', 'place', 'great', 'comedians', 'Louis', 'CK', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'as', 'well', 'Steve', 'Carroll', 'Louis', 'Shimel', 'Saturday', 'Evening', 'FunHouse', 'cartoons', 'would', 'be', 'snapped', 'up', 'SNL', 'sad', 'part', 'advertising', 'blatantly', 'fact', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'front', 'center', 'skits', 'few', 'moments', 'amusement', 'happen', 'when', 'not', 'skit', 'Clown', 'Grandma', 'even', 'skits', 'showing', 'up', 'introduce', 'next', 'bit', 'one', 'many', 'awful', 'characters', 'Also', 'Louis', 'CK', 'was', 'happy', '90s', 'was', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'best', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'screamingly', 'hilarious', '00s', 'when', 'mined', 'worst', 'moments', 'uncomfortable', 'laughs.If', 'reason', 'still', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'Hans', 'Franz', 'Church', 'Lady', 'means', 'DVD', 'can', 'also', 'enjoy', 'warmed', 'Ross', 'Perot', 'imitations', 'same', 'George', 'Bush', 'imitation', 'point', 'only', 'George', 'Bush', 'amusing', 'want', 'see', 'sketch', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'animal', 'yeah', 'complete', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'patting', 'back', 'how', 'edgy', 'skit', 'was', 'next', 'episode', 'However', 'be', 'warned', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'skits', 'as', 'funny', 'once', 'did', 'Chances', 'are', 'only', 'thought', 'skits', 'were', 'funny', 'were', 'college', 'stoned', 'time', 'high', 'school', 'bipolar', 'Most', 'likely', 'will', 'find', 'irritating', 'desperate', 'uncle', 'who', 'putting', 'Chinese', 'accent', 'saying', 'Me', 'horny', 'height', 'comedy.Oh', 'skit', 'broad', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'nominated', 'academy', 'awards', 'Poor', 'Steve', 'Carroll', 'stuck', 'Indian', 'stereotype', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'worst', 'Asian', 'stereotype', 'hamming', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'put', 'buck', 'teeth', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffanys', 'part', 'Simpsons', 'when', 'Krusty', 'Clown', 'tries', 'do', 'comedy', 'only', 'realize', 'routines', 'are', 'considered', 'old', 'terrible.In', 'many', 'ways', 'racist', 'skit', 'entire', 'show', 'overly', 'broad', 'comic', 'sensibility', 'overt', 'reliance', 'stereotypes', 'whacky', 'catch', 'phrases', 'would', 'feel', 'bad', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'once', 'won', 'fame', 'ton', 'money', 'doing', 'junk', 'got', 'accustomed', 'same', 'way', 'father', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Night', 'grew', 'comfortable', 'big', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'watch', 'show', 'hate', 'goofy', 'accent']",The Dana Carvey Show

And for a short sketch show, I thought the audience interaction was draining from the pace of the show unlike someone like Dave Chappelle.
