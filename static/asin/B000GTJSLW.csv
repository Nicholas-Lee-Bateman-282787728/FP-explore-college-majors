1006846,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000GTJSLW,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[48, 56]","I'm going to say this right now and get it out of the way: The third season of Penn and Teller: Bulls***! is definitely the weakest.  It seems that they had hit a bit of a dry spell, and some of the topics weren't as interesting as they seemed, while some seemed to be rehashes of earlier episodes (Ghostbusting being the prime example).  The good news is that despite the somewhat weaker episodes, the show is still highly entertaining (Penn and Teller are as hilarious as ever), and things pick up again in the fourth season.For the uninitiated, Bulls***! is a show where Penn Jillette and his partner Teller research concepts, many of which are taken for granted to be true in society, and thorougly discredit and mock them.  Using humor, sarcasm, and most of all, well-researched facts, the duo attempts to show people that not everything is as it seems.  Some of the better episodes this year (many of which were at the level of quality that has been established in previous seasons) deal with Signs from Heaven, The Best, Hair, Conspiracy Theories.  For example, in the episode about Hair, Penn and Teller discuss why having hair shouldn't be as important as Americans make it out to be.  Furthermore, they question why haircuts can cost so much when they interview a stylist who is known to cut the hair of celebrities, and charges exorbitant amounts of money for the service.  Hair-care products are attacked, and we also are treated to a bit on the comb-over, wherein it is both mocked and praised when a colleague displays his own comb-over, which truly deserves praise as the world's greatest.  In the episode called The Best, Penn and Teller talk about why people's pursuit of having ""the best"" can often lead to bad results, especially an insatiable obsession.  One man they interview is nuts about palm pilots and buys pretty much every new model so that he can have the ""latest and greatest"".  Seeing as how new models come out very often, he is throwing away a lot of money to upgrade to a new model when the improvements are almost non-existent.  Sometimes in the show, Penn and Teller show their disgust for what certain people are saying or doing.  In previous years, they've accused mediums (people who claim that they can talk to the dead) of conning grieving family members.  This year, they attack conspiracy theorists who say that 9/11 is a hoax and a religious couple who are actually profiting off of their comatose daughter by selling merchandise claiming to be a miracle.  At these times, Penn and Teller drop the humor and implore the audience and their subjects to see the error of their ways.After two nearly perfect seasons, a drop in quality was inevitable, and it occurred this season.  The episode about College was a little hard to follow at times and didn't make sense (though maybe I'm just a little biased because I am currently a college student).  The Life-Coaching and Circumcision episodes were also a little out there.  There were other episodes that may have been good overall, but displayed a few segments that didn't seem to fit.  However, a bad season of Penn and Teller is still very enjoyable and is better than a lot of other stuff on television these days.  Fans of Penn and Teller will enjoy these episodes very much, if not as much as earlier (and subsequent) seasons, but people who have never viewed the show should try to see it on TV before buying (assuming you have Showtime).  The show is full of profanity and even nudity (usually gratuitous) and may be offensive to some people.  Also, some people may find some of the subjects to be offensive.  While I enjoyed the episode about Family Values and the ""traditional family"", I can definitely see how certain people would find it offensive and even horrifying.  As for the Signs from Heaven episode, let's just say that not everyone gets Showtime.  Still, if you don't mind a little cursing and nakedness, you should definitely check out Penn and Teller: Bulls***!",4,Penn and Teller Are Still Entertaining Despite A Weaker Season,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,3974,"[""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'right', 'now', 'get', 'way', 'third', 'season', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'Bulls***', 'definitely', 'weakest', 'had', 'hit', 'bit', 'dry', 'spell', 'topics', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'seemed', 'seemed', 'be', 'rehashes', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'Ghostbusting', 'being', 'prime', 'example', 'good', 'news', 'somewhat', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'show', 'still', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'are', 'as', 'hilarious', 'ever', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'again', 'fourth', 'uninitiated', 'Bulls***', 'show', 'where', 'Penn', 'Jillette', 'partner', 'Teller', 'research', 'concepts', 'many', 'are', 'taken', 'granted', 'be', 'true', 'society', 'thorougly', 'discredit', 'mock', 'Using', 'humor', 'sarcasm', 'most', 'well-researched', 'facts', 'duo', 'attempts', 'show', 'people', 'not', 'everything', 'better', 'episodes', 'year', 'many', 'were', 'level', 'quality', 'been', 'established', 'previous', 'seasons', 'deal', 'Signs', 'Heaven', 'Best', 'Hair', 'Conspiracy', 'Theories', 'example', 'episode', 'Hair', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'discuss', 'why', 'having', 'hair', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'important', 'Americans', 'make', 'be', 'Furthermore', 'question', 'why', 'haircuts', 'can', 'cost', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'interview', 'stylist', 'who', 'known', 'cut', 'hair', 'celebrities', 'charges', 'exorbitant', 'amounts', 'money', 'service', 'Hair-care', 'products', 'are', 'attacked', 'also', 'are', 'treated', 'bit', 'comb-over', 'wherein', 'mocked', 'praised', 'when', 'colleague', 'own', 'comb-over', 'truly', 'deserves', 'praise', 'world', 'greatest', 'episode', 'called', 'Best', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'talk', 'why', 'people', 'pursuit', 'having', 'best', 'can', 'often', 'lead', 'bad', 'results', 'especially', 'insatiable', 'obsession', 'One', 'man', 'interview', 'nuts', 'palm', 'pilots', 'pretty', 'much', 'new', 'model', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'latest', 'greatest', 'Seeing', 'how', 'new', 'models', 'come', 'out', 'very', 'often', 'throwing', 'away', 'lot', 'money', 'upgrade', 'new', 'model', 'when', 'improvements', 'are', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'Sometimes', 'show', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'show', 'disgust', 'what', 'certain', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'doing', 'previous', 'years', ""'ve"", 'accused', 'mediums', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'can', 'talk', 'dead', 'conning', 'grieving', 'family', 'members', 'year', 'attack', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'who', 'say', '9/11', 'hoax', 'religious', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'profiting', 'comatose', 'daughter', 'selling', 'merchandise', 'claiming', 'be', 'miracle', 'times', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'drop', 'humor', 'implore', 'audience', 'subjects', 'see', 'error', 'ways.After', 'two', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'seasons', 'drop', 'quality', 'was', 'inevitable', 'occurred', 'season', 'episode', 'College', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'little', 'biased', 'am', 'currently', 'college', 'student', 'Life-Coaching', 'Circumcision', 'episodes', 'were', 'also', 'little', 'out', 'there', 'were', 'other', 'episodes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'overall', 'displayed', 'few', 'segments', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'However', 'bad', 'season', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'better', 'lot', 'other', 'stuff', 'television', 'days', 'Fans', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'will', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'very', 'much', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'earlier', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'viewed', 'show', 'should', 'try', 'see', 'TV', 'buying', 'assuming', 'have', 'Showtime', 'show', 'full', 'profanity', 'even', 'nudity', 'usually', 'gratuitous', 'may', 'be', 'offensive', 'people', 'Also', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'subjects', 'be', 'offensive', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'Family', 'Values', 'traditional', 'family', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'how', 'certain', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'offensive', 'even', 'horrifying', 'Signs', 'Heaven', 'episode', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'not', 'everyone', 'Showtime', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'cursing', 'nakedness', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'Bulls***']",Penn & Teller - Bullsh*t - The Complete Third Season

My cable provider is kind enough to send me broadcasts of televangelism, infomercials, and FOX News 24 hours per day.  PBS is usually good, but when they need money they roll the Deepak Chopra tape.  Ugh.  I get another channel that features shows about psychics and makeovers.  And it's called The Learning Channel!So Penn & Teller are providing a much-needed service.  I particularly enjoyed the first two seasons because P&T; focused their energy on targets that are both widely believed and thoroughly bogus.  Examples include ghosts, creationism, and animal rights extremism (PETA).  Most of the major media continues to handle these issues delicately, as if there were two legitimate sides to the story.  There aren't, and P&T; deserve credit for telling it like it is.However, as other reviewers have pointed out, the material seems to be getting a little thin in the 3rd season.  It's a little too easy too attack positions that hardly anyone believes (like the extreme version of gun control that is the focus of one episode).  And issues like the Endangered Species Act don't really seem worthy of their talents.  It may be a dumb piece of legislation, but the episode (complete with a wheelchair-bound woman who is purportedly homeless as a result of the ESA) comes off as a little hysterical.  Some of the topics are pretty similar to ones they have already covered.For better or worse there is no shortage of BS for them to focus on, and I'm still looking forward to the fourth season.",3,there are at least two uses for a shovel,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,1565,"['hardly', 'be', 'said', 'television', 'rife', 'nonsense', 'My', 'cable', 'provider', 'kind', 'enough', 'send', 'broadcasts', 'televangelism', 'infomercials', 'FOX', 'News', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'PBS', 'usually', 'good', 'when', 'need', 'money', 'roll', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'tape', 'Ugh', 'get', 'channel', 'psychics', 'makeovers', 'called', 'Learning', 'Channel', 'So', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'are', 'providing', 'much-needed', 'service', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'P', 'T', 'focused', 'energy', 'targets', 'are', 'widely', 'believed', 'thoroughly', 'bogus', 'Examples', 'include', 'ghosts', 'creationism', 'animal', 'rights', 'extremism', 'PETA', 'Most', 'major', 'media', 'handle', 'issues', 'delicately', 'were', 'two', 'legitimate', 'sides', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'P', 'T', 'deserve', 'credit', 'telling', 'is.However', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'material', 'be', 'getting', 'little', 'thin', '3rd', 'season', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'too', 'attack', 'positions', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'extreme', 'version', 'gun', 'control', 'focus', 'one', 'episode', 'issues', 'Endangered', 'Species', 'Act', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'worthy', 'talents', 'may', 'be', 'dumb', 'piece', 'legislation', 'episode', 'complete', 'wheelchair-bound', 'woman', 'who', 'purportedly', 'homeless', 'result', 'ESA', 'off', 'little', 'hysterical', 'topics', 'are', 'pretty', 'similar', 'ones', 'have', 'already', 'covered.For', 'better', 'worse', 'shortage', 'BS', 'focus', ""'m"", 'still', 'looking', 'forward', 'fourth', 'season']",Penn & Teller - Bullsh*t - The Complete Third Season

Pouliot,"[2, 4]","This is my first exposure to Penn & Teller's wit, and it was wild - like sticking your head out the car window into a tornado.Penn&Teller; use humor, righteous outrage and sarcasm to attack some truly soft-headed people whose ideas that continue to pulsate in the national psyche. Whether they be 9/11 conspiracy nuts, people who see Jesus in their bathroom door or supposedly-scientific ghost trackers, P&T; go after them mercilessly and called them out as charlatans, frauds or fools. Actually, they don't do this exactly, since they'd be in trouble with the slander police. In order to demolish the reputations of those they dislike, they call them (loudly) *ssh*oles and f*ck*rs. If this kind of vituperative name-calling is not your cup of tea, at least you  have been warned.I like the work that P&T; do. There are far too many people making a buck at the expense of truth. Whether you're peddling a book claiming that the moon landing was a hoax, or selling tickets a the Dallas, Texas JFK Conspiracy Museum, or (as with the Dalai Lama) trying to get support to re-establish a priestly autocracy, you are an idiot or a scammer and deserve to have P&T; come after you hammer and tong.Some criticize P&T; for using the same techniques that their targets use. I was more bothered by P&T;'s attacks on humble people of genuine faith. The poor woman who sees Jesus's eyes in her bathroom door may be wrong, but at least she doesn't appear to be profiting monetarily. That's unlike the woman who found an image of the Virgin Mary in her grilled cheese sandwich, who made a few bucks when she sold the sandwich to a casino. Audrey Santo's family may be faking the ""oils"" that drip from the statues in their brain-damaged daughters' room, but they are living with a real family tragedy and deserve some measure of restraint. P&T; use these examples unfairly to attack religion as a whole. They can spout atheism if they want, but they could be less abusive to those with genuine faith. And who's to say that God *doesn't* speak through sandwiches, bathroom doors and tacos? Is he limited to whirlwinds and burning bushes?That said, BS Season 3 is fun and challenging.

As for the other episodes, like the Boy Scouts...BRAVO...Its about time someone stood up to them.
