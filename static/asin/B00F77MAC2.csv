Too bad they didn't continue the plastic Bender head of the previous box set.  This set will not travel well.  But who is toting these around?  I'm guessing most folks are either viewing them at home, or ripping them to a PED for watching on the go.Box arrived a little dented, but I could live with it.  Many discs had slid out of storage slots in transit.  Played them all; no problems.  I have a very old & finicky DVD player which is a great way to measure disc quality.  Two discs needed to be run through my disc cleaner/polisher before being able to play, otherwise no problems.You get all original Fox episodes (seasons 1-4), the 4 direct-to-DVD movies, and all new Comedy Central episodes (seasons 5-8).  Very few extras.  Would have liked a feature that lets you translate the alien language graffiti & such.  Lot of cool jokes hidden in it.  Yeah, I know there are cryptos available on the internet, but I have a life.

One thing I want to say if you haven't listened to the DVD commentaries by the writers, directors and voice actors you should they are funny and insightful. They are the reason I encourage people who love this show to buy the DVDs. At the time of writing this review this box that was cheaper than buying everything individually so that right there in my opinion makes it worthwhile.I would just like to say on a personal note seasons one through five to me are brilliant but the later seasons and movies didn't have the same spark. Now I still watch everything Futurama because the show was amazing but the later seasons weren't the same caliber as the early years.Thanks for reading!",4,Good price cheaper than buying them individually & Listen to the commentaries!,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,775,"['am', 'big', 'Futurama', 'fan', 'watch', 'show', 'year', 'jumping', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'One', 'thing', 'want', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'listened', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'writers', 'directors', 'voice', 'actors', 'should', 'are', 'funny', 'insightful', 'are', 'reason', 'encourage', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'show', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'time', 'writing', 'review', 'box', 'was', 'cheaper', 'buying', 'everything', 'individually', 'so', 'that', 'right', 'there', 'opinion', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'say', 'personal', 'note', 'seasons', 'one', 'five', 'are', 'brilliant', 'later', 'seasons', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'spark', 'Now', 'still', 'watch', 'everything', 'Futurama', 'show', 'was', 'amazing', 'later', 'seasons', 'were', ""n't"", 'same', 'caliber', 'early', 'years.Thanks', 'reading']",Futurama: The Complete Series

This contains all 8 volumes/seasons of Futurama as well as the 4 straight to DVD movies that help give the show a second life after being cancelled the first time. Also comes with a 2014/3014 calender, but all it is really is a long double sided page that is 3 page folded length long. Very cheap, however you're not buying this set for the calendar. Any fan of Futurama should get this set. There is something to consider though...I am very fortunate to recieve my Futurama set from Amazon without any problems. No smashed corners or scratched discs. As some of the other reviews on here states, the product that makes up the boxes containing the DVD's feel cheap. I do agree and feel that they could of used plastic cases instead, yet I really can't complain since my set did not have any flaws which suprised me as the package didn't have any padding (Thanks UPS -_-). I checked every disc and box of every season. Like I said before, I am very fortunate with this set. I also recieved Futurama post cards that came with Bender's Big Score that was not mentioned. I didn't think they would included this. So another +. The box case that covers the whole set is a good sturdy feeling cover unlike the boxes containing the DVDs.I haven't bought a individual season of Futurama since they re-did the seasons over and I do not know if the boxes are made the same as the ones in this box set. I assume they did as I did buy the movies Bender's Big Score and etc. that were made with this material, but IDK if they feel cheap or not if you buy them individually. I did do the math and it is cheaper to buy this complete set as it sits at $114 as I type this review instead of buying each one seperately. I was luckly enough to buy this the week it was $80! Great buy! Yeah I know, I'm a lucky bastid. So, if you are a huge fan of Futurama, I strongly suggest buying this set. Especially if it is less than $114. I recieved a smashed, dented, scratched free set and I'm sure there will be others who will get the same. Of course there will be some that will have some damage, but that risk always comes from ordering online. I strongly suggest you bite if you're on the fence about this. You can always return it if you're unhappy with a damaged product. Hopefully you can snag this at a deal price for $80 like I did.

This review is for the way the set is set up.What in the hell is this?  I was excited to get my set today.  I opened it up and saw the things that held the DVDs.  I knew I was in trouble.  It is so cheaply made.  You pull the thing holding the DVDs out and the freaking discs either fall out and roll all over the place, or they are so stuck in the thing you have to pry them out.  Volumes 1 - 5 and The Beast with a Billion Backs have discs that are so badly damaged, that even after running them through a disc cleaner multiple times, they are still damaged.  This is one of the cheapest sets I have ever seen.  I got it from Familyvideo.  I hope they let me get another set and still keep the one I have so that I can swap the discs.  If not, I am just going to send this cheap piece of junk back.  To anyone who gets this.  Check each disc.Just a quick update.  I wrote to familyvideo.  I told them about the damage and of how I would like to keep my set until I got another in order to swap the discs.  In deed they said ok and are sending me another set with a return label.  They are a great site with good prices on movies.  Thank you familyvideo!!!!This will be the last thing I add to this review.  So I got my second set today.  Damaged.  This one was even worse.  Some of the season cases were all bent up.  One I thought the DVD was missing.  It had just slid down in the case.  I was able to fix all but two discs.  One from volume 3 and the beast with a billion backs.  I have been through this before with sets.  So, instead of getting familyvideo to send me another complete set, I just ordered that volume and movie from trusted sellers, used like new on Amazon.  It just seemed like an easier thing to do.  So there it is.  For anyone who is thinking about ordering this set, I would have to recommend you do not.  It is the cheapest thing I've ever seen.  Discs fall out, the cases are falling apart and are so easy to bend and just break the discs.  Just buy the volumes individually.  It will save you a lot of time.
