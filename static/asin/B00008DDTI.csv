The new actor did a great job, just would have been nice to keep the same family. This one moves a little slower than the first and has a few less animal encounters and action scenes but is filmed in the winter so it's fun to see the snow scenes. Kids LOVE the first one and like this one. I'm with them :).",4,I like it :),1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,394,"['Good', 'sequel', 'first', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'same', 'actor', 'Jenny', 'new', 'actor', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'keep', 'same', 'family', 'one', 'little', 'slower', 'first', 'few', 'less', 'animal', 'encounters', 'action', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'winter', 'fun', 'see', 'snow', 'scenes', 'Kids', 'LOVE', 'first', 'one', 'one', ""'m""]","The Adventures of the Wilderness Family, Part 2"
