Burchfield,"[1, 5]","Out of 7 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer I would have to say that #3 and #5 would rank as my favorites, #6 falls more in the middle.I did like the opening episodes in which Buffy is brought back to life, the Tara/Willow split up and various bits and pieces of other episodes. I did not like the segments featuring Warren, Jonathan & Andrew, they were the corniest bits in the entire season and I could have dome without them. Hells Bells, in which Xander leaves Anya at the Altar, was about as bad even though I guess it did serve as background for many further story plotlines. Once More with Feeling was bizarre but kind of entertaining, I do like the soundtrack CD better than listening to the show, seems like better sound on it.Just about anything Alyson Hannigan did this season was good.

There are few seasons of any show that have reached this apex of storytelling.  In season 6, the Scoobies learn they are their own worst enemy, as they mainly confront problems of their own creation -- problems that result from their own actions and choices during the first 5 seasons!I can understand why some fans might consider this season too bleak and unrelenting.  However, one has to view it in the context of the entire series.  The season is essentially one long climax for the series, (with Season 7 being more of an epilogue).  Another criticism of this season is that the show had become too much of a soap opera.  While it is true that there are only a handfull of standalone episodes, the serial structure carries the viewer along through a very clear beginning, middle and end, with a number of unexpected twists along the way.  I consider the style more ""novelistic"", because -- unlike soap operas -- the characters undergo such major transformations.  Indeed, I find more similarities to great Victorian novels like Wuthering Heights than to Dynasty.Best Episodes:* Smashed - the title says it all* Once More, With Feeling - more than just a gimmick, fits beautifully into the overall storyline* Normal Again - the ""meta story"" behind the series?* Villains - events reach a boiling pointOnly a few of the episodes do not rate 5 stars.",5,Transcends What Came Before (No Spoilers),1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,1466,"['was', 'disappointed', 'Season', '5', 'easy', 'forgive', 'light', 'masterpiece', 'Season', '6', 'are', 'few', 'seasons', 'show', 'have', 'reached', 'apex', 'storytelling', 'season', '6', 'Scoobies', 'learn', 'are', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'mainly', 'confront', 'problems', 'own', 'creation', 'problems', 'result', 'own', 'actions', 'choices', 'first', '5', 'seasons', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'fans', 'might', 'consider', 'season', 'too', 'bleak', 'unrelenting', 'However', 'view', 'context', 'entire', 'series', 'season', 'essentially', 'one', 'long', 'climax', 'series', 'Season', '7', 'being', 'more', 'epilogue', 'criticism', 'season', 'show', 'had', 'become', 'too', 'much', 'soap', 'opera', 'true', 'are', 'only', 'handfull', 'standalone', 'episodes', 'serial', 'structure', 'viewer', 'very', 'clear', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'number', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'way', 'consider', 'style', 'more', 'novelistic', 'soap', 'operas', 'characters', 'undergo', 'such', 'major', 'transformations', 'Indeed', 'find', 'more', 'similarities', 'great', 'Victorian', 'novels', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'Dynasty.Best', 'Episodes', '*', 'Smashed', 'title', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'more', 'just', 'gimmick', 'beautifully', 'overall', 'storyline*', 'Normal', 'Again', 'meta', 'story', 'series', '*', 'Villains', 'events', 'reach', 'boiling', 'pointOnly', 'few', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'rate', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Buffy has to deal with coming back to life - one without college, her mother, Giles, a love lorn Spike, and an attention craving Dawn, who starts shoplifting just to get what she wants.Xander and Anya are about to get married, but seem to have many unresolved issues about it. Things come to a head, Buffy style, on their wedding day.Willow & Tara are facing problems of their own, mainly Willow's 'addiction' to magic. This is one of the few things I hadn't liked about this season - so far, the magic was a positive influence on Willow, turning her from the 'Softer Side of Sears' Willow to a much more confident young woman. The fact that Willow was made to take it 'too far' seems like saying that she may never get out of being a helpless geek... Also, her fast decline into evil at the end of the season seemed to be hapenning too fast, but was dragged out for too long (3 episodes). This might not have seemed that bad when the episodes were shown on a weekly basis, but it is very noticeable when you watch them back to back.And what's p with the special features? Not only are they split in 2 (one part mid season, the second at the end), but they seem to be worse than ever - the 'panel discussion' and 'series overview' (which would've fitted better at the end of season 7, BTW) were produced - for TV stuff, and mainly told us how great Joss, Marti & Sarah were (but especially Joss).

In addition to the obligatory (and always well-done) season overview, there are outtakes, karaoke music videos (!) and plenty of supplemental material on the musical episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling.&quot;  And even a somewhat amateurish but still very interesting panel discussion with several cast members and production personnel.As for the show itself, season 6 has been maligned for being too dark, and its main villains not worthy successors to the &quot;Big Bad&quot;'s of the past.  I don't think either of these are fair criticisms.  After the events of season five, culminating in Buffy's death, there had to be a long road back to getting things the way they were.  Buffy made some very HUMAN mistakes along the way, as did some of the other characters.  Yeah, it was depressing in places...but that's life.As for the villains, I think the writers figured it was time to lighten up, especially considering the events mentioned above.  And for fans of horror/sci-fi/fantasy, etc., the &quot;Trio&quot; were a delight, with their nonstop, often obscure pop culture references.  And of course, it wasn't the boys who turned out to be the REAL Big Bad of season six.  Alyson Hannigan was consistently amazing throughout the season.And this probably could go without saying, but &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; has got to be one of the top ten hours of television ever produced.Buy it already!",4,"Underrated season, with more bonus material than ever!",1085443200,"05 25, 2004",2004,1518,"['first', 'thing', 'may', 'notice', 'set', 'more', 'bonus', 'features', 'previous', 'DVD', 'sets', 'addition', 'obligatory', 'always', 'well-done', 'season', 'overview', 'are', 'outtakes', 'karaoke', 'music', 'videos', 'plenty', 'supplemental', 'material', 'musical', 'episode', 'quot', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling.', 'quot', 'even', 'somewhat', 'amateurish', 'still', 'very', 'interesting', 'panel', 'discussion', 'several', 'cast', 'members', 'production', 'personnel.As', 'show', 'season', '6', 'been', 'maligned', 'being', 'too', 'dark', 'main', 'villains', 'not', 'worthy', 'successors', 'quot', 'Big', 'Bad', 'quot', 'past', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'fair', 'criticisms', 'events', 'season', 'five', 'culminating', 'Buffy', 'death', 'had', 'be', 'long', 'road', 'back', 'getting', 'things', 'way', 'were', 'Buffy', 'made', 'very', 'HUMAN', 'mistakes', 'way', 'did', 'other', 'characters', 'Yeah', 'was', 'depressing', 'places', 'life.As', 'villains', 'think', 'writers', 'figured', 'was', 'time', 'lighten', 'up', 'especially', 'considering', 'events', 'mentioned', 'fans', 'horror/sci-fi/fantasy', 'etc.', 'quot', 'Trio', 'quot', 'were', 'delight', 'nonstop', 'often', 'obscure', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'boys', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'REAL', 'Big', 'Bad', 'season', 'six', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'was', 'consistently', 'amazing', 'season.And', 'probably', 'could', 'go', 'saying', 'quot', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'quot', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'hours', 'television', 'ever', 'already']",N/A

However, I was very impressed with Season 6. There is no question that S6 is the darkest season of the 7. Many reviewers have covered that. I will add that the villians in this season weren't really Warren, Andrew, and Jonathan. Those characters added humor and whimsy to the season, but ultimately the villians were the main characters themselves. Buffy, Willow, Xander, Anya, Spike ect. were all at major crossroads in their lives. The forces they were compelled to fight against were very much inner demons. I believe that this introspection was handled with sensitivity and truth. Buffy and the gang were confronted with very harsh realities, insecurities, vulnerabilities, and such. After seeing the show maintain a fairly light and bubbly tone for much of its first five seasons(which I loved as well), I was pleased to see Season 6 had more of a gritty edge, and dark dramatic fire. After the two hour season premiere 'Bargaining,' where Buffy is resurrected, the season begins building the tension ever so slowly before it threatens to break out all over in a very very impressive trilogy of episodes called 'Tabula Rasa,' 'Smashed,' and 'Wrecked.' Here, Willow descends into the the dark forces of magic and Buffy fully succumbs to the seductions of Spike. One scene alone is worth mentioning for its extraordinary power, emotional resonance, and masterful direction. I am surprised that more reviewers have not commented upon it. In the finale of episode 9, 'Smashed,' Buffy and Spike confront each other in an absolutely electric and dynamic battle of brawn and words, throwing each other through walls and crashing through the floors of an old rotted out building. As everything is crumbling down around them, figuratively and literally, they passionately embrace and further assault their bodies against each other and against the building itself. I remember being stunned beyond measure and moved to tears. It's just one scene in this incredible series that will be etched in my consciousness for many years to come. Of course, who could forget the tremendously exciting and wrenching finale when ""Willow doesn't live here anymore"" or 'Once more, With Feeling.' Overall, the trio of ""super villians"" added laughs and gags in the right places, but this was easily the season when the scooby gang became hereos AND villians, forced to turn on themselves and each other. There were some episodic disappointments. 'Gone' and 'Doublemeat Palace' were dramatically stagnant, and it really felt like the writers were simply stalling, especially coming out of such a strong trilogy of preceding episodes. Overall, season 6 was fresh, exciting, and new. Who ever saw the violent and shocking conclusion to 'Seeing Red' coming or the vengeance Willow wreaks on Warren? Not me!

Season six is certainly not as good as five, but it's a close second. Six was really the season of Willow, and Alyson Hannigan was never better. The highlight of season six has to be the musical episode ""Once More with Feeling."" Not all the singing was great, but I was actually quite surprised by the talent of the cast. Season six was the first season of Buffy to air on UPN and it seemed like the writers and producers were more willing to spend time developing the supporting players, but that might have been due to the fact that Whedon had handed over day-to-day running of the show to someone else.  The main problem I had with the season was the dark tone, darker than usual.  They tackled issues such as destructive relationships (Buffy and Spike), addiction (Willow and magic), and teenage angst (Dawn's sticky fingers).  I was not a huge fan of the Spike and Buffy relationship when it first aired on television.  I thought it was degrading and difficult to watch at times - especially some of the sexual situations.  Granted, Gellar and Marsters showed some great talent, but it just never clicked with me.  Watching it now on DVD I can better understand where the writers were going:  Buffy was pulled out of heaven and brought back to hell of Sunnydale; her destructive relationship with Spike was a natural progression for the character -- even if an unpleasant one.  The biggest problem with this season was lameness of the bad guys:  three geeks trying to become super villains.  Granted, by the end of the season their desire for fame and glory leads to tragic consequence, but it all could have happened over a series of three or four episodes, not 22.

777539,AM2ITPX4ZEUIA,B0000DANYD,"Amazon Customer ""Wildrider""","[10, 14]","Part of the problem with reviewing &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; is that when television gets this good, expectations are raised exponentially. Therefore, as a fan and a viewer, I was disappointed in the second half of S6 because I felt the writers were no longer willing to take the massive leaps of fantastic fiction they had been willing to take in previous seasons.Up through the breathtaking musical episode, &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot; and the follow-up &quot;Tabula Rasa,&quot; Season Six meets and exceeds expectations for a show of this quality. It was at this point that things started to go wrong. Instead of setting up Willow as the season's &quot;Big Bad,&quot; through her use of magic as power and continuing with the slow buildup toward Willow as so desirous of that power she would do nearly any reckless thing, they changed the concept of magic totally and turned her into an addict, something that suited neither her character nor what magic had been established as. Perhaps fearing what the fans would feel if allowing Willow to go that far, the writers made it &quot;not her fault&quot; so she could be quickly forgiven -- it was a cop-out, and not worthy of a show that allowed their former male lead to not only descend into true, violent, frightening evil, but managed to redeem him not only back to his former male lead status, but gave him his own show to continue that redemption. Willow's fall and rise was handled very poorly and while &quot;bad Buffy&quot; is still better than a lot of other television, it simply screamed with the obvious &quot;they could have done better.&quot;What also dragged season six was the unrelenting depression. While it's understandable in &quot;real life&quot; that Buffy would indeed have these problems, in fiction it's harder to deal with -- and week after week of seeing Buffy not being able to pick up and move on like the hero she had been portrayed as was extremely difficult. The songs in the musical seemed to indicate Buffy was coming to understand her problem and would learn to deal with it, but it wasn't until the finale that she &quot;got it&quot; and literally and figuratively climbed out of her hole to move on with her life -- which dragged THAT story out way, way too long.The greatest crime of all in season six is the way the characters were sacrificed to a story that didn't suit them. Willow had been set up from the beginning as deeply fascinated with a power that would make her noticed as she had never been noticed, not a crack addict; Giles could have been given a much better reason for actor Anthony Stewart Head to leave the show than abandoning Buffy when she obviously needed him so she could &quot;stand on her own&quot;; and Buffy herself had been shown time and again to be strong enough to handle herself in any situation, so suddenly turning her into the weak, almost pathetic figure we got for most of the season was jarring and difficult to deal with. We knew she had experience as a waitress (not to mention those high SATs), so why was fast food the only job she could get? Why were Willow and Tara never shown to be assisting with the money problems while living in Buffy's house? Were they just sponging off Joyce's life insurance, waiting for Buffy to come back to life and give them money? Why was Buffy suddenly so weak that Spike could assault her, when for five seasons she'd been able to throw him around like a sock puppet?There are a lot of whys involved in season six, and a lot of questions raised never answered, and while there are some powerful episodes, the season as a whole never really flies the way it could have, and much potential was missed. Still, as I said, it's such good TV it's worth having around to experience &quot;once more, with feeling,&quot; and definitely a needed part of a complete Buffy collection.",4,"A near-miss, but still superior television",1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,3857,"['Part', 'problem', 'reviewing', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'quot', 'when', 'television', 'good', 'expectations', 'are', 'raised', 'exponentially', 'Therefore', 'fan', 'viewer', 'was', 'disappointed', 'second', 'half', 'S6', 'felt', 'writers', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'willing', 'take', 'massive', 'leaps', 'fantastic', 'fiction', 'had', 'been', 'willing', 'take', 'previous', 'seasons.Up', 'breathtaking', 'musical', 'episode', 'quot', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'quot', 'follow-up', 'quot', 'Tabula', 'Rasa', 'quot', 'Season', 'Six', 'meets', 'exceeds', 'expectations', 'show', 'quality', 'was', 'point', 'things', 'started', 'go', 'wrong', 'Instead', 'setting', 'up', 'Willow', 'season', 'quot', 'Big', 'Bad', 'quot', 'use', 'magic', 'power', 'continuing', 'slow', 'buildup', 'Willow', 'so', 'desirous', 'power', 'would', 'do', 'nearly', 'reckless', 'thing', 'changed', 'concept', 'magic', 'totally', 'turned', 'addict', 'something', 'suited', 'character', 'what', 'magic', 'had', 'been', 'established', 'Perhaps', 'fearing', 'what', 'fans', 'would', 'feel', 'allowing', 'Willow', 'go', 'far', 'writers', 'made', 'quot', 'not', 'fault', 'quot', 'could', 'be', 'quickly', 'forgiven', 'was', 'cop-out', 'not', 'worthy', 'show', 'allowed', 'former', 'male', 'lead', 'not', 'only', 'descend', 'true', 'violent', 'frightening', 'evil', 'managed', 'redeem', 'not', 'only', 'back', 'former', 'male', 'lead', 'status', 'gave', 'own', 'show', 'continue', 'redemption', 'Willow', 'fall', 'rise', 'was', 'handled', 'very', 'poorly', 'quot', 'bad', 'Buffy', 'quot', 'still', 'better', 'lot', 'other', 'television', 'simply', 'screamed', 'obvious', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better.', 'quot', 'What', 'also', 'dragged', 'season', 'six', 'was', 'unrelenting', 'depression', 'understandable', 'quot', 'real', 'life', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'would', 'indeed', 'have', 'problems', 'fiction', 'harder', 'deal', 'week', 'week', 'seeing', 'Buffy', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'move', 'hero', 'had', 'been', 'portrayed', 'was', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'songs', 'musical', 'seemed', 'indicate', 'Buffy', 'was', 'coming', 'understand', 'problem', 'would', 'learn', 'deal', 'was', ""n't"", 'finale', 'quot', 'got', 'quot', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'climbed', 'hole', 'move', 'life', 'dragged', 'THAT', 'story', 'out', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'long.The', 'greatest', 'crime', 'season', 'six', 'way', 'characters', 'were', 'sacrificed', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'suit', 'Willow', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'beginning', 'deeply', 'fascinated', 'power', 'would', 'make', 'noticed', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'noticed', 'not', 'crack', 'addict', 'Giles', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'much', 'better', 'reason', 'actor', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'leave', 'show', 'abandoning', 'Buffy', 'when', 'obviously', 'needed', 'could', 'quot', 'stand', 'own', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'time', 'again', 'be', 'strong', 'enough', 'handle', 'situation', 'suddenly', 'turning', 'weak', 'almost', 'pathetic', 'figure', 'got', 'most', 'season', 'was', 'jarring', 'difficult', 'deal', 'knew', 'had', 'experience', 'waitress', 'not', 'mention', 'high', 'SATs', 'so', 'why', 'was', 'fast', 'food', 'only', 'job', 'could', 'get', 'Why', 'were', 'Willow', 'Tara', 'never', 'shown', 'be', 'assisting', 'money', 'problems', 'living', 'Buffy', 'house', 'Were', 'just', 'sponging', 'off', 'Joyce', 'life', 'insurance', 'waiting', 'Buffy', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'give', 'money', 'Why', 'was', 'Buffy', 'suddenly', 'so', 'weak', 'Spike', 'could', 'assault', 'when', 'five', 'seasons', ""'d"", 'been', 'able', 'throw', 'around', 'sock', 'puppet', 'are', 'lot', 'whys', 'involved', 'season', 'six', 'lot', 'questions', 'raised', 'never', 'answered', 'are', 'powerful', 'episodes', 'season', 'whole', 'never', 'really', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'much', 'potential', 'was', 'missed', 'Still', 'said', 'such', 'good', 'TV', 'worth', 'having', 'experience', 'quot', 'once', 'more', 'feeling', 'quot', 'definitely', 'needed', 'part', 'complete', 'Buffy', 'collection']",N/A
777540,AP29O9FGN4Q2B,B0000DANYD,Ametisti,"[0, 3]",This is a very strange season.Buffy is dead and her friends are still trying to gather up their lives since their friends death. The season does pick up though. I like season six much more then season seven.It has so many different surprises. They did things that I never thought they would ever do on the show. I n ever could have imagined Willow becoming so evil while in grief. This season has some of the best acting and writing. Unlike season five it isn't completely depressing and insane.It picks up quiet a bit and tries to answer some questions. Personally I can't wait to get this set. I hope that they will do a special set for season seven and something neat for the musical episode in season six.That would be great. I am glade that it is coming closer for this set to be out. I am very excited to get it my self.There are some great moments in this season. I really can't wait to get it once it comes out.,4,Rising Phoenix,1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,919,"['very', 'strange', 'season.Buffy', 'dead', 'friends', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'gather', 'up', 'lives', 'friends', 'death', 'season', 'pick', 'up', 'season', 'six', 'much', 'more', 'then', 'season', 'seven.It', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'surprises', 'did', 'things', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'ever', 'do', 'show', 'n', 'ever', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'Willow', 'becoming', 'so', 'evil', 'grief', 'season', 'best', 'acting', 'writing', 'season', 'five', ""n't"", 'completely', 'depressing', 'insane.It', 'up', 'quiet', 'bit', 'tries', 'answer', 'questions', 'Personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'set', 'hope', 'will', 'do', 'special', 'set', 'season', 'seven', 'something', 'neat', 'musical', 'episode', 'season', 'six.That', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'am', 'glade', 'coming', 'closer', 'set', 'be', 'out', 'am', 'very', 'excited', 'get', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'season', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'once', 'out']",N/A
777541,A928WN8NV03WZ,B0000DANYD,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[3, 4]","This season wasn't as bad as a lot of people complained.  It just tossed a bit more reality into the mix.  Willow showed that she had a dark and obsessive part of her nature.  Xander and Anya were shown to have more doubts than they'd admitted about the impending marriage.  Buffy starts to realize how much her job as a slayer has affected the other aspects of her life.  She needs money and her family can't help her, so she works at a fast food restraunt.  The big bad was a bit confusing, the Nerd Trio turns out to be more of a catalyst than real evil.This season dealt more with the pains of their lifestyle than in other seasons.  They all had to deal with something painful in their lives, Willow with her magic addiction, Buffy with how much she had missed out on, Xander started realizing the baggage with marrying a former vengence demon, etc....  Plus I thought that the Nerd Trio was a funny change of pace and good comic relief.Season HighlightsBargaining/Afterlife:  Willow performs a dark ritual to bring Buffy back to life because they think she might be suffering in a hell dimension.  But when Buffy comes back she isn't acting herself.  She manages to save them, but they wonder if something is wrong.Flooded:  A trio of wannabe supervillians from past episodes return with the plans of taking over Sunnydale with a form of high tech sorcery and decide that they will have to take on Buffy, they are made up of Warren(I was made to love you), Johnathan(many early episodes), and Andrew(brother of a boy who bred hellhounds).Once More With Feeling:  The gang falls under the spell of a dancing demon and everything becomes a musical.  One of the best episodes of the series.Tabula Rasa:  Though the scoobies try to convince her otherwise, Willow thinks that she can fix Buffy with a forgetting spell.  The problem is that the spell makes everyone forget, just as a gang of vampires attacks looking for Spike.Smashed:  Amy is finally returned to human form.  She takes willow and furthers her addiction to magic.  Buffy and Spike finally have sex.Wrecked:  Willow falls deeply into addiction and goes to a shady man known as the Rack to get a magical jolt of energy.  Wonderful episode wtih surreal effects.Dead Things:  The Trio faces a tragedy when Warren accidentally kills his former girlfriend and covers it up.  Johnathan starts to have second thoughts about being a villian.Hell's Bells:  Xander and Anya's wedding encounters difficulty when a man shows him the dark possible future he and Anya will have if he marries, but there is question on who the man really is.  This episode shows why Xander tries to keep a cheerful outlook, after looking at his family it makes perfect sense.Seeing Red:  Warren becomes super powered with the discovery of an artifact.  He goes off on a rampage thinking he is invicible.  when he is thwarted, he gets revenge on the gang by shooting Buffy, and accidently killing Tara in the process sending Willow off the deep edge.Villians:  Willow becomes enraged and obessed with gaining vengence on the trio for the death of Tara.  She starts absorbing magic and her hair and eyes turn black.  The scoobies are worried because she is becoming exponetially more powerful and less and less like willow.Two to Go:  Willow isn't satisfied with the Death of Warren.  She wants the other two, and the scoobies want to save her from a dark path she is starting to take.  But they can't stop her, she drains the Rack of his powers and seems unstopable.Grave:  Willow drains more magical energy and feels the pain of the world.  She decides that the best solution for all the pain is to end the world and the suffering it is going through.  She is near godlike with all the powers she has drained and is moving fast.  The gang is clueless on how to stop their former friend.",4,Grittier and darker,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,3820,"['season', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'lot', 'people', 'complained', 'just', 'tossed', 'bit', 'more', 'reality', 'mix', 'Willow', 'showed', 'had', 'dark', 'obsessive', 'part', 'nature', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'were', 'shown', 'have', 'more', 'doubts', ""'d"", 'admitted', 'impending', 'marriage', 'Buffy', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'job', 'slayer', 'affected', 'other', 'aspects', 'life', 'money', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fast', 'food', 'restraunt', 'big', 'bad', 'was', 'bit', 'confusing', 'Nerd', 'Trio', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'catalyst', 'real', 'evil.This', 'season', 'dealt', 'more', 'pains', 'lifestyle', 'other', 'seasons', 'had', 'deal', 'something', 'painful', 'lives', 'Willow', 'magic', 'addiction', 'Buffy', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'missed', 'out', 'Xander', 'started', 'realizing', 'baggage', 'marrying', 'former', 'vengence', 'demon', 'etc', 'thought', 'Nerd', 'Trio', 'was', 'funny', 'change', 'pace', 'good', 'comic', 'relief.Season', 'HighlightsBargaining/Afterlife', 'Willow', 'performs', 'dark', 'ritual', 'bring', 'Buffy', 'back', 'life', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'suffering', 'hell', 'dimension', 'when', 'Buffy', 'back', ""n't"", 'acting', 'save', 'wonder', 'something', 'wrong.Flooded', 'trio', 'wannabe', 'supervillians', 'past', 'episodes', 'return', 'plans', 'taking', 'over', 'Sunnydale', 'form', 'high', 'tech', 'sorcery', 'decide', 'will', 'have', 'take', 'Buffy', 'are', 'made', 'Warren', 'was', 'made', 'love', 'Johnathan', 'many', 'early', 'episodes', 'Andrew', 'brother', 'boy', 'who', 'bred', 'hellhounds', '.Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'gang', 'spell', 'dancing', 'demon', 'everything', 'musical', 'One', 'best', 'episodes', 'series.Tabula', 'Rasa', 'scoobies', 'try', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'Willow', 'can', 'fix', 'Buffy', 'forgetting', 'spell', 'problem', 'spell', 'everyone', 'forget', 'just', 'gang', 'vampires', 'attacks', 'looking', 'Spike.Smashed', 'Amy', 'finally', 'returned', 'human', 'form', 'willow', 'addiction', 'magic', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'finally', 'have', 'sex.Wrecked', 'Willow', 'deeply', 'addiction', 'shady', 'man', 'known', 'Rack', 'get', 'magical', 'jolt', 'energy', 'Wonderful', 'episode', 'wtih', 'surreal', 'effects.Dead', 'Things', 'Trio', 'tragedy', 'when', 'Warren', 'accidentally', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'covers', 'up', 'Johnathan', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'being', 'villian.Hell', 'Bells', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'wedding', 'encounters', 'difficulty', 'when', 'man', 'dark', 'possible', 'future', 'Anya', 'will', 'have', 'question', 'who', 'man', 'really', 'episode', 'why', 'Xander', 'keep', 'cheerful', 'outlook', 'looking', 'family', 'perfect', 'sense.Seeing', 'Red', 'Warren', 'super', 'powered', 'discovery', 'artifact', 'off', 'rampage', 'thinking', 'invicible', 'when', 'thwarted', 'revenge', 'gang', 'shooting', 'Buffy', 'accidently', 'killing', 'Tara', 'process', 'sending', 'Willow', 'deep', 'edge.Villians', 'Willow', 'enraged', 'obessed', 'gaining', 'vengence', 'trio', 'death', 'Tara', 'absorbing', 'magic', 'hair', 'eyes', 'turn', 'black', 'scoobies', 'are', 'worried', 'becoming', 'exponetially', 'more', 'powerful', 'less', 'less', 'willow.Two', 'Go', 'Willow', ""n't"", 'satisfied', 'Death', 'Warren', 'other', 'two', 'scoobies', 'want', 'save', 'dark', 'path', 'starting', 'take', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'her', 'Rack', 'powers', 'unstopable.Grave', 'Willow', 'drains', 'more', 'magical', 'energy', 'pain', 'world', 'best', 'solution', 'pain', 'end', 'world', 'suffering', 'going', 'godlike', 'powers', 'drained', 'moving', 'fast', 'gang', 'clueless', 'how', 'stop', 'former', 'friend']",N/A

See this season of buffy was different from all the other seasons in the fact that it lacked a real ""big bad"" and was so dramatic.  This season saw the growing up of the characters and redefineing them all.  Buffy coming back from the dead is a lot to deal with, getting over the loss of her mother, Dawn stealing, Willow getting addicted to magic, Xander asking Anya to marry him and then leaving her at the alter, Tara being killed, Spike getting his soul back, Giles leaving Sunnydale and moving back to England. All of that is a lot to deal with so the lack of a real big bad is a smart choice, besides how many big bads can come to Sunnydale and be wrapped up in a year? Come on now!

777543,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0000DANYD,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[4, 5]","When people talk about the sixth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, darkness always comes to mind.  This was definitely the darkest season of the show, especially with the year's ""big bad"" being life itself.  Sure, there was the Evil Trio and Dark Willow (Alyson Hannigan) to deal with, but at the end of the season, it was obvious that Joss Whedon and company had found a way to create a truly unkillable foe.  However, it would not be their last time, but that's a story for next year.Anyway, for those of you who don't know, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) died at the end of Season 5 as she sacrificed herself to save her sister Dawn (Michelle Tractenberg) as well as the rest of the world.  Now, three months later, her friends Willow, Xander (Nicholas Brendan), Anya (Emma Caulfield) and Tara (Amber Benson) decide to resurrect her.  One reason being is that they miss her, but, more importantly, they believe that she is suffering in a hell dimension due to the nature of her death.  On the night they decide to perform the ritual, Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) leaves Sunnydale to return to England.  Their spell is interrupted by a group of biker demons who find out that the Hellmouth is without a slayer, so when Buffy wakes up (in her coffin six feet underground), she first has to dig her way out, then she is met by a Sunnydale on fire where the bikers have taken over.  Understandably, she thinks that she has gone to Hell.  Later, after she has recovered, she thanks her friends for saving her from Hell, but she soon turns to Spike (James Marsters) and tells him that she was in fact in Heaven.  She doesn't want her friends to know because it would devastate them to know they ripped her from Heaven.  However, that is one of many secrets held this season.After Giles returns, he debates leaving again because he feels that he's standing in Buffy's way, Willow, who is becoming addicted to magic, casts a spell on Tara in order to make her forget about their fighting, Dawn turns into a kleptomaniac, and Xander and Anya have reservations about their upcoming wedding.  And these are all in the first half of the season before the great musical episode Once More With Feeling, where they are forced to reveal their secrets to each other through song.After that episode, things begin to spiral downward very quickly for the Scooby Gang.  Tara leaves Willow, who then becomes a magic junkie.  Her old friend Amy (Elizabeth Anne Allen), now back in human form, takes her to a magic ""dealer"" named Rack (Jeff Kober) who supplies Willow with very dark and dangerous powers.  Meanwhile, Buffy enters into a destructive relationship with Spike in order to have any feelings, even if it is hatred and disgust.  Even though Buffy is alive, she is still dead inside, and the only way she can feel anything is by sleeping with a vampire she detests.  And as if they didn't have enough to worry about, old villains Warren (Adam Busch) and Jonathon (Danny Strong) as well as Andrew (Tom Lenk), the brother of villain Tucker (Brad Kane), decide to join forces.  They decided to team up to take over Sunnydale and each of them has their own unique ability.  Warren is a mechanical genius, Jonathon is a spellcaster, and Andrew, like his brother Tucker, can summon and control demons.  Despite their intentions and abilities, though, they are never more than a thorn in Buffy's side... until the end that is.This is a season that, in order to truly appreciate, must be viewed with a knowledge of the underlying theme.  Some of the first Buffy episodes that I saw were from this season, and I was very disappointed because it seemed like the demons were either part of a secondary storyline, or they were merely metaphors and not the grand villains that I had been told about.  When I watched the episodes now, though, I really enjoyed them because I knew what to look for and what to expect.This season may not have the greatest villains in the sense that they were the most threat to Buffy or the world, it did have great stories.  First of all, even though the Trio was the most pathetic villains Buffy faces, they are definitely the funniest.  Also, Dark Willow is just so cool.  This year also has some amazing episodes such as the musical Once More With Feeling, the amnesia episode Tabula Rasa, the anomaly episode Normal Again, where a demon's poison makes Buffy see an alternate universe where Sunnydale is just a figment of her imagination... or is that world the real world?  Then, there was Smashed, the episode where things really began to take a dark turn.  Also, there are the last few episodes: in Entropy and Seeing Red, they are the metaphoric ""Everything's going to Hell"" episodes where Buffy's affair with Spike is revealed, Anya gets revenge on Xander for leaving her at the altar, and the Nerdy Trio finds a device that makes them nearly invincible.  However, everything does begin to go to Hell when Warren, angry over being beaten by Buffy returns with a gun.  He wounds Buffy and accidentally kills another Scooby, which prompts the onset of Dark Willow in Villains, Two To Go, and Grave.  Also, the final twist with Spike is amazing.Some other great episodes include Bargaining Pts. 1 and 2, Flooded, Life Serial, Gone, and As You Were.  This season also has, in my opinion, the creepiest episode: Doublemeat Palace, the fast food episode.  Also, it had the tripiest episode, Wrecked.Even though this is the ""worst"" season of Buffy, keep in mind that it is still a great season, it just isn't as good as the other 6.  Only one season remains to be released, so this should occupy you until Season 7.",4,Something to Sing About,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,5624,"['When', 'people', 'talk', 'sixth', 'season', 'Buffy',

777544,A13NM1PES9OXVN,B0000DANYD,"Angela Mitchell ""Angela Mitchell""","[13, 16]","(...)There seem to be two camps on this season -- those who call it Season Sux, and those who think it's the Best! Season! Ever!I'm kind of in the middle myself. S6 starts out very very strong, with some of the series' best episodes (""Once More with Feeling,"" ""Tabula Rasa,"" etc), but soon frustrated me because many eps began to have that heavy-handed ""After School Special"" feel -- and most of all because its sense of logic was so inconsistent. I began to feel cheated -- the Scoobies suddenly said and did things that seemed wildly out of character based on the five previous seasons:1.  Case in point:  Buffy.  Who goes to work in fast food for minimum wage. Why? This made no sense for any of us who have watched all five previous seasons. After all, as early as Season 3, Buffy was able to support herself at the very least by waiting tables (not to mention surely offering other potential skills like teaching self defense or even temping). For me, Buffy working at a McDonald's-like place isn't ""real-world"" or plausible, and if the writers were trying to show that ""work sucks,"" well, there were plenty of options without resorting to a job she would (at worst) have held six years earlier.2.  Willow -- Then there's the awful ham-handed and over-the-top ""Magic addiction"" storyline for Willow -- SO disappointing.  The season clearly starts off in a different direction by showing us a Willow who is becoming a powerful witch -- maybe too powerful, and maybe she's enjoying that power a little too much (even daring to coolly threaten Giles in the second hour of the season opener -- a great scene).  It was an interesting potential storyline for a great character.  But this very believable ""corruption by power"" storyline, unfortunately, quickly devolves into a metaphor of ""magic-as-crack"" -- never mind that this goes against everything we've seen in the Buffyverse for the previous 5 seasons. It's a cheap and clumsy metaphor.  (It is interesting to note that Willow's affliction is then completely cast aside with a few words by Giles at the beginning of Season 7, so someone else at ME must have gotten a clue.)3.  Spike -- At the end of Season 5, Spike had become a grudging hero and accepted member of the Scooby Gang. Suddenly in Season 6 he's once again a semi-bad guy, is treated like dirt by the Scoobs and becomes Buffy's sex toy (and most disturbingly, her punching bag as well).  Then there's the completely unbelievable episode where Spike attacks Buffy, an episode so badly written and unpleasantly filmed it almost put me off the show forever.OF THE GOOD:So what makes Season 6 worth seeing? First off, it's Buffy, which means it's still better than 90% of the rest of TV. Other good points include:* Once More, With Feeling -- one of the best eps in the history of the show, with gorgeous songwriting and beautiful performances by the entire cast -- Amber Benson and ASH especially offer stunning vocal performances. (Even if, to be honest, the kiss at the end looks more painful than passionate...)* Tabula Rasa -- alternately hysterically funny and heartbreaking.* The Nerd Trio -- I admit it, I have a soft spot for the nerd troika, and just about everything Jonathan or Andrew says makes me laugh. I also think Warren's a terrific villain, very well played by Adam Busch.* The Final 2 eps -- the final two or three eps of the season offer more interesting character growth for Willow that she saw for most of the rest of the season. And Alyson Hannigan plays it all beautifully. Nice to see Xander finally get a major hand in this season's apocalypse, too.So that's the good. My main beef is that I just didn't buy that every major Scooby character would become abusive in some way: Willow abusing Tara with mind control, Buffy beating Spike to a pulp while sleeping with him, Spike's brutal assault on a weak and whimpering Buffy, Xander's constant and nasty verbal abuse of Anya (Dawn doesn't abuse anyone, she just shoplifts and whines louder than ever). It certainly isn't fun to watch and more importantly didn't ring true to me.So -- I'm still conflicted on this season.  Good stuff, with flaws.  It is the first season I actually didn't go out and buy right away.  Coming after a really strong Season 5, I felt like someone looked at all that growth and strength and coolness in the Season 5 finale, and then said, ""Just kidding.""I've liked many of S6 showrunner Marti Noxon's previous writings for the show (and ""The Wish"" remains one of the best eps in Buffy's history IMHO) -- but I think her vision of Buffy Season 6 as ""'Party of Five' with monsters"" just doesn't work.All just MHO, of course, but I personally would have preferred less 'Party of Five' -- and more monsters.",3,Wildly Uneven Season... but Worth Seeing,1087430400,"06 17,

Remember how silly you felt when Buffy had a sister all of a sudden, and you complained that he was cheating and thought there couldn't possibly be an explanation for it all? Well, he had it all planned beforehand. He even gave us hints the season before, when brat-boy cast his spell that changed reality. So there. I had faith. I didn't whine. I was excited and wanted to see where he was going with it... YES, that IS an I-told-you-so.)Now, the point. Season 6 was directed by Marti Noxon, his understudy. It is different because she is different. Like hot and sour soup from two different cooks, it is not bad, but it is not the same, either. This, aparently, in a lot of cases freaked longtime fans out completely.So... get over it. This is the way it is. Someone else took over for a season and did the same things Joss would have done to the characters, but she is a different cook: her taste is darker, less happy, less friendly. The dialouge is different. The show is different.

777548,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0000DANYD,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[4, 11]","Oh boy. The Buffy community has always been fierce and can be picky at times. No other season in the show's run caused more controversy and a split down the middle among fans than season six of the show. Some say it was too dark. Some say there was too much this and too much that. That it was too soap opera-y. I was someone who was against season six when it originally aired on TV, but that has lessened a bit over time and repeated viewings. It is still off kilter and the least season of the series, but get into that in a minute. ""Bargaining Part 1"" and""Bargaining Part 2"" deal with the repercussions of Buffy's death at the end of the brilliant season 5 and her resurrection in these two episodes. A pretty high octane two parter, but the least of the show's season premieres. The running theme through this season was Buffy learning to be alive again, and to deal with being back on the hellish earth after being in the warm and problem free heaven. ""After Life"" is one of the better episodes of the season. It comes complete with scary moments, a great creature, and a teriffic final scene with Buffy and Spike. Thenext two, ""Flooded"" and ""Life Serial"", are banal time wasters that showcase how Buffy was not hitting on all fronts. That would be the case with most of the episodes this season. ""All The Way"" was the Halloween episode, and it is the worst Halloween one of the three. It's not really bad at all, but nothing to live up to the previous two at all. The Buffy/Spike hook-up was a major player this season. Some loved it and some didn't. I liked it in season 5, but the story this seaosn left me cold. It was so much better in season 7 too. Sarah Michelle Gellar and James Marsters were really good this year, as always, but the material left them as characters that were hard to relate too or care as much for. That changes towards the end with Spike doing something that I will not say. Alysan Hannigan was brilliant this season. With Willow delving deeper into magic, Hannigan got the juicy stuff. ""Tabula Rasa"" is what sets things in motion. Her relationships with her friends and with Tara suffer horribly. It was a nice arc and Hannigan was truly astounding. The death of her lover at the end of ""Seeing Red"", is what Buffy does best. Shocks you and breaks your heart. Was this punishment for Tara being gay?. Of course not. It was a great shock device used with Jenny Calendar in season 2, and Joyce in season 5. With Willow ending up with Kennedy in season 7, the whole punishment for being gay bile should be put to rest. Xander and Anya's relationship goes on, but it's the weakest of the story arcs. ""Hell's Bells"", the wedding episode, was a terrible episode, although Anya was good. Many romantic entanglements went further in ""Entropy"", and came crashing to a head. However, it was a pretty abysmal episode as well. ""Normal Again"", which featured Buffy delusioning that the past 6 years has all been a dream is nicely done. Not great, but a season stand out. The last four episodes, ""Seeing Red"", and especially ""Villains"", ""Two To Go"", and ""Grave"", are the best parts of the season. Evil Willow was fascinating and scary and Hannigan really got to shine in these episodes. Scary, sad, and action packed. A real emotion rollercoaster. Perfect. Should Willow of died?. Of course not. What a slap in the face to the show. Her living and redeeming herself is a stronger concept and far more interesting. The frequent abscence of Anthony Stewart Head as Giles is the most disappointing. There many flaws about this season, but him not being there as much left a huge void, as well as a good portion of the show's heart. There was debate over the nerd troika as well. It was odd in the beginning, but still delightful because they were funny and had some really great moments of humor. But it did change. They got darker and more serious, especially Warren, and it showed that they could become dangerous and a real threat. Once again, Joss showed that he knows what he is doing and that we should put a little more trust into him at certain times. ""Once More, With Feeling"", the musical episode, was the crowning achievement of the season, the series, and of Joss Whedon as a writer/director. It is brilliant and breathless from start to finish. One of the best hours of television ever. The show was still incredibly written, directed, and acted this season, but it was just different. Some misguided reviews seem to think that equals that it is horribly done and trash. Not even close. The show changed and grew and matured as it always does every season, but this year not everyone got it. Yes, it wasn't great, but there are splendid moments of pure genius, acting and everything else. The writing lost it's way along the course of the season, but it was never bad. Just going for something different. Plus, is ""Doublemeat Palace"", where Buffy gets a job at the fast food joint and discovers horrible secrets behind the burner, really the worst episode ever?. No. I will give those honors to ""Inca Mummy Girl"" from season 2. Season 6 was a misguided and uneven adventure, but they did their best and tried to make the most of what it was and what it became. Sometimes it's hard to watch our beloved characters get into such dark times that make it hard to watch. But it's pain. It's maturing. It's life. I am still no great fan of season 6, but like I said earlier, it's better once you watch it over and see things again. Season 7 was a lot better and got things on more of a track. Some people here didn't like that one either, but it was good with some flaws but, I guess that will have to wait for the DVD. Season 6 should be included in your collection, if only to have the continuity.",3,Buffy : One Dark Year,1071446400,"12 15, 2003",2003,5724,"['Oh', 'boy', 'Buffy', 'community', 'always', 'been',

777549,AWQDIP5LPT8KT,B0000DANYD,Bat185,"[0, 0]","Season 6 of Buffy had all the potential to be as great as previous seasons except for one problem....The writing. The writers took darkly-toned plots and filled then with an abundance of light humor.The biggest problem of Season 6 was the characterizations of Andrew, Jonathan, and Warren; better known as ""The Trio"". They SHOULD have been called ""The Trio of Bumbling Buffoons"". They were neither menacing nor strong. Jonathan's and Andrew's constant bickering over pop culture references was like watching an episode of The Simple Life with Paris and Nicole. They are a bunch of annoyances. The season could have ended in one episode with Buffy snapping their necks and killing them.Take the episode ""Life Serial"" for example. Buffy is trying to get her life back together by auditing classes with Tara and helping Anya and Giles at The Magic Box. The Trio decide ""Hey, wouldn't it be funny to make Buffy think she's crazy by putting her in a time loop?"" ""Gone"" was just another absurdity. The Trio craft a ray gun that turns Buffy invisible so Buffy decides to have some fun with it by playing pranks on Dawn and the social worker. These characters gave Buffy no motivation to use her physical and mental abilities. Warren was the only villian who was mildly intelligent. Getting revenge on Buffy (for destroying April the robot and Katrina dumping him in season 5)by shooting her and accidentally shooting and killing Tara was great. Warren and Willow should have been the ""Big Bads"" of the season. I think it would have been more enjoyable.I found nothing wrong with the ""real-life"" issues the characters faced in Season 6 such as Buffy having to run the house and also find a job while still being the slayer. It was a great transition from teenager to young adult. Xander had a chance to grow up in this season as well with planning a wedding. Using the ""supernatural as metaphor"" theme that was the basis of the show's earlier episodes, it was cool to see Willow become addicted to the magicks and let them consume her after the loss of her true love, Tara. It gave some indication that the show was trying to adhere to continuity.All in all, Season 6 was not what it should have and could have been but shows tend to have low points sometime.",3,"Dark plots, light dialogue-a BAD combination!",1108857600,"02 20, 2005",2005,2251,"['Season', '6', 'Buffy', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'previous', 'seasons', 'one', 'problem', '.The', 'writing', 'writers', 'took', 'darkly-toned', 'plots', 'filled', 'then', 'abundance', 'light', 'humor.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'characterizations', 'Andrew', 'Jonathan', 'Warren', 'better', 'known', 'Trio', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Trio', 'Bumbling', 'Buffoons', 'were', 'neither', 'menacing', 'strong', 'Jonathan', 'Andrew', 'constant', 'bickering', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'was', 'watching', 'episode', 'Simple', 'Life', 'Paris', 'Nicole', 'are', 'bunch', 'annoyances', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'one', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'snapping', 'necks', 'killing', 'them.Take', 'episode', 'Life', 'Serial', 'example', 'Buffy', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'auditing', 'classes', 'Tara', 'helping', 'Anya', 'Giles', 'Magic', 'Box', 'Trio', 'decide', 'Hey', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'funny', 'make', 'Buffy', 'think', 'crazy', 'putting', 'time', 'loop', 'Gone', 'was', 'just', 'absurdity', 'Trio', 'craft', 'ray', 'gun', 'Buffy', 'invisible', 'so', 'Buffy', 'have', 'fun', 'playing', 'pranks', 'Dawn', 'social', 'worker', 'characters', 'gave', 'Buffy', 'motivation', 'use', 'physical', 'mental', 'abilities', 'Warren', 'was', 'only', 'villian', 'who', 'was', 'mildly', 'intelligent', 'Getting', 'revenge', 'Buffy', 'destroying', 'April', 'robot', 'Katrina', 'dumping', 'season', '5', 'shooting', 'accidentally', 'shooting', 'killing', 'Tara', 'was', 'great', 'Warren', 'Willow', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Big', 'Bads', 'season', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable.I', 'found', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'real-life', 'issues', 'characters', 'faced', 'Season', '6', 'such', 'Buffy', 'having', 'run', 'house', 'also', 'find', 'job', 'still', 'being', 'slayer', 'was', 'great', 'transition', 'teenager', 'young', 'adult', 'Xander', 'had', 'chance', 'grow', 'up', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'planning', 'wedding', 'Using', 'supernatural', 'metaphor', 'theme', 'was', 'basis', 'show', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'Willow', 'become', 'addicted', 'magicks', 'let', 'consume', 'loss', 'true', 'love', 'Tara', 'gave', 'indication', 'show', 'was', 'trying', 'adhere', 'continuity.All', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tend', 'have', 'low', 'points', 'sometime']",N/A

So it is with Season 6.Now, before you start the fan boy/girl rant, hear me out.Season 5 built up to this. Buffy lost her mother then dies herself. Willow starts the slippery slope. Xander and Anya get in too deep too fast.If Season 6 were all about defeating the villian of the season and the occasional problem of the week, it would have been a disappointment. Everything that happened had to come to a head and it did.(Spoilers ahead)Willow crossed the line when she resurrected Buffy. Yes, she meant well, as did Xander. Believing their best friend to be in eternal torment, they did what they thought was right and fair - rescued her. Little did they know that Buffy had earned her reward. The magic Willow used was blood magic and anything that requires death should not be undertaken lightly - consequences are a given.Xander got in over his head. When you fall in love, marriage seems like a natural progression. But then, look at the examples of marriage and family that Xander has - his father drinks too much and berates his mother, his mother's idea of cooking is picking a take out menu.With little experience in life and love, you naturally expect to fall into the same habits you see from your parents. As a woman, I wanted to smack Xander for waiting until the wedding to admit his fears, but I could also understand the sudden panic when faced with a false future where he would grow to resent Anya until he kills her in cold blood.And let's not forget that Buffy left Heaven folks. She died twice saving the world. She got her reward - a place with no pain, no evil, no coldness or harshness. And suddenly, she's ripped from there, forced to dig herself out of her own grave and thrust back into the same role she has been in for the last 5 years, one she didn't always want. If she'd come back with the attitude of ""everything's hunky-dory, let's get down to slay-business"" I'd have been hard-pressed to tell her apart from the Buffybot.When she comes back, she does some things that are wrong. She abuses Spike, ignores her sister, resents her friends. In a situation not of her making and beyond her understanding, she makes some wild choices. That's often part of the human experience.And Spike - he's grasping at straws. Maybe it's because he's been a demon for over 100 years or maybe it's a human failing, but he confuses sex and love. Buffy abuses his affections by sleeping with him while she reminds him that he's not good enough for her. However, Spike does some abusing of his own - by working to isolate Buffy from her friends. For him to attempt to rape her - okay, not an easy scene to watch and by James's admission a very hard one to film, seemed in keeping with the ""relationship"" they'd had up to that point. Remember that this is the same Spike that was going to tie Dru up and torture her until she loved him again.Maybe Giles should have stepped in, maybe not. As much as he took on the role of father-figure in the show and in the lives of Buffy, Dawn, Xander and Willow - he's not a parent and he never will be. Even if he were, being a parent is not easy and watching your children mature is a heartbreaking process. Often, you stand on the sidelines and cringe, aching to step in and worrying if you are making the right decision by not.This season was dark. Some even may have called it depressing.

I felt like Buffy finally became and adult instead of a little kid.Then there was Season Five. The characters regressed. Buffy is living at home again, and suddenly she has a sister that never before existed. But at least the big bad villain of the season was compelling. The actress who played Glory was hot! And the writers did a good job slowly revealing who she really was.And now we come to Season Six. The writers decided college was just not an interesting source of stories, so instead Buffy is still living in her (now dead) mother's house along with Willow? Why didn't they just sell the house?My favorite characters in Season Six are Spike (who still has the same chip in his head from Season Four), the witch girl who was a rat for three seasons but who Willow turns back to human--sorry, I forgot her name, but she was beautiful to look at and a lot more fun than Willow or Buffy, and finally I liked the evil Willow at the end of the series.I was really rooting for the evil Willow to kill the ""trio."" I don't understand the whole moral message behind the assertion that it wasn't proper to kill them. The whole ""it's a human realm issue"" doesn't make the LEAST bit of sense. Buffy had no problem killing the very human knights in the Fifth Season. The trio used magic to summon demons and wreak other mischief removing any bright line distinction between the magical and the human.I don't like the way the ""Scooby gang"" abused Spike despite all of the genuine help that he's given them. He has had many opportunities to let various members of the gang die by doing nothing, but time and time again he saved their lives.

It was due to the writing. After coming off season five with the insurmountable task of living up to the show's legacy on a new network, Whedon and crew tried something different. It was interesting, and the performances were all solid throughout, but it lacked focus, and just seemed to turn more and more into ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" with vampires.One of the biggest shortcommings of season six was the Big Bad, if it can even be called that. Previous seasons had always had iconic villains that were there to test Buffy and the Scooby gang and to provide a great deal of tension build-up leading to the finale. Also, each villain offered a lesson that could be applied to real life. The Master: We may be bound to fate, but we can rise to meet it. Angelus: People change, and sometimes those you thought you knew can hurt you the most. The Mayor/Faith: All politicians are inherently evil, and no matter how hard you try to save someone who has lost their way, they can't always come back. Glory: the importance of family, and the power of love.Now, after this great string of bad guys and gals, we get (drum roll please) three nerds who have read too many comic books and want to be arch-villains. On paper, it looks like crap. In excecution, it was exactly that. Sure, it's slightly more likely than some new demonic threat to Sunnydale, but Buffy eats realism for breakfast. Where's the conflict? Most of the time, Buffy's new arch-nemesises. . . ses. . . arch-nemeses (yeah, that's an actual quote) are just really annoying. Whedon and co. seamed to realize this about three quarters of the way through the season, and set up Willow with a magical addiciton (D.A.R.E. anyone?) that eventually leads to her wanting to destroy the world. It feels like a cop-out, but is handled with scary talent from Alyson Hannigan. But the season simply goes too much soap opera for its own good. Ex: Xander's wedding debacle, Terra's death, Spike's attempted rape of Buffy.That's not to say the season is all bad. Buffy's struggle to cope with being the slayer again after essentially being in heaven makes for an interesting relationship with Spike. However, this isn't really handled with the show's typical finesse, but there are certainly moments. The real gem of the season is the musical episode ""Once More with Feeling"" which brings back a good deal of the classic Buffy spirit which is sadly absent for much of the sixth season.All in all, season six should have started solid, in order to land on its feet after the great ending of season five. Unfortunately, though the ideas are well-executed, they just aren't all that good to begin with.The extras on this disk are solid as ever, with a few extra gems thrown in for good measure.

What resulted was a dark but interesting time in the Vampire Slayer's 7 season run.  Season Six deals with &quot;the Freshman year of life&quot; -- it's an ugly year for most people.  Buffy creators try to reflect reality through their Sci Fi mirror, so they let everything fly.  The season dealt with addiction, more death, and worst of all trying to find your own identity when you have to grow up.  You make mistakes - big ones!  And so does Buffy and the whole Scooby gang.  LIFE turns out to be the biggest villan Buffy has ever faced, and worse still ... you can't beat it.Season Six boasted some of the most ambitious episodes ever -- &quot;DOUBLEMEAT PALACE&quot; finds Buffy working in fast food, &quot;ONCE MORE WITH FEELING&quot; gave us a musical where demon choruses chimed along with singing Scoobies!, and then we have the DARK WILLOW saga in which our favorite witch proves her vampire alter ego from seasons past was her darkside on a good day!  There are the trio of villans who turn out to be normal guys with delusions.  They sadly come to represent a tragic flaw in our society we've seen played out in high schools again and again.  It was an ambitious place to go, and some fans reacted strongly to the new tact.  But the show stayed poignant, just got more dark and twisted - notably when Buffy and Spike got together and things go horribly horribly wrong in one of the most horrifying scenes in the series ever in Buffy's bathroom.  Horrifying cause it all seemed so real!The DVDs come in the six fold packaging we've come to expect.  The menus are simpler -- no montages this time, just an urn of Osiris spits out dust with episode titles.  TONS of EXTRAS on the musical episode, and the commentaries.  A season overview and a panel discussion at the Academy of Radio Arts and Sciences.  Two minutes of outtakes from this season are included -- oddly only showing certain characters flubbing lines ... no Gellar bad takes(?).  The star is never in the extras for some reason.  Probably contract disputes.  But they get around that by including an A&amp;E special called &quot;TELEVISION WITH BITE&quot; that documents the show and has Sarah Michelle Gellar talking about Buffy ... at last on DVD!

However, there were several parts of this that I really liked, but also a few things I didn't really like.The main aspect of this season that I had a problem with, like Sarah Michelle Gellar, was the degrading of Buffy as a character. Between her completely sexual.... relationship... with Spike and her distant, traumatized mood for a chunk of the season, some of the spunk and brightness of her character was lost. Don't get me wrong... both these things had their place in the plot, but her being with Spike seemed a little bit too lacking in understandability, and her distant mood fit in, considering that she had to dig her way out of her grave and was brought back from heaven, but it seemed to last a little bit too long.However, the part of this season that I really liked was the focus on witchcraft. Willow's life as a witch seems to have been a little bit underplayed in past seasons (or maybe it's just that I have a thing for witches :)). It is very interesting to watch Willow go dark and see her as such a different character than she was before. This major part of the plot was great, and Willow's sureness in her craft mixed with Buffy's partial loss of self seemed to somehow even out.overall, this season is great!",4,Fabulous... with a few kinks,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,1328,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'season', 'rest', 'was', 'fantastic', 'opinion', 'However', 'were', 'several', 'parts', 'really', 'liked', 'also', 'few', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like.The', 'main', 'aspect', 'season', 'had', 'problem', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'was', 'degrading', 'Buffy', 'character', 'completely', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Spike', 'distant', 'traumatized', 'mood', 'chunk', 'season', 'spunk', 'brightness', 'character', 'was', 'lost', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'things', 'had', 'place', 'plot', 'being', 'Spike', 'seemed', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'lacking', 'understandability', 'distant', 'mood', 'fit', 'considering', 'had', 'dig', 'way', 'grave', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'heaven', 'seemed', 'last', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'long.However', 'part', 'season', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'focus', 'witchcraft', 'Willow', 'life', 'witch', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'bit', 'underplayed', 'past', 'seasons', 'maybe', 'just', 'have', 'thing', 'witches', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Willow', 'go', 'dark', 'see', 'such', 'different', 'character', 'was', 'before', 'major', 'part', 'plot', 'was', 'great', 'Willow', 'sureness', 'craft', 'mixed', 'Buffy', 'partial', 'loss', 'self', 'seemed', 'somehow', 'even', 'out.overall', 'season', 'great']",N/A
777561,AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B0000DANYD,Brittany Rose,"[2, 5]","There is a lot of controversy about the new direction the show took in this season, where the focus on fighting the bad guys seems lessened and the theme of ""Consequences"" in the real world is more played up.  This season is all about relationships between characters and the subsequent -consequences- when these bonds are broken, harmed, or even formed.  The series does take a darker turn here, but based on how it begins - after the very powerful season 5 finale ""The Gift"" - it only seems right that this is the way it goes.When first watching this season I was a bit disappointed at the lack of a 'super-evil' as it is defined by the 3 'super-geeks' of Sunnydale; Johnathan - the geek from high school, Warren - the robot creator of season 5, and Andrew - who I don't believe we are introduced to till this season yet comes back in season 7.  However as the season progresses hints are subtly placed that the real evil in Sunnydale is more then what appears, leading to an emotional (yet somewhat overly sappy) finale.The most important thing to note about Season 6 is that individually there are probably the most singular stand-out episodes, even if the unifying theme of a supervillan is not.  Most of the episodes combine dark humor with character development in terms of showing a deeper side to each individual on the show.  ""Life Serial"" is a hilarious episode where you get to see the geek trio point out Buffy's 'weaknesses' as she attempts to forge ahead in life.  ""Once More, With Feeling"" is one of the most landmarked episodes in series history, as it is a musical where everyone must tell the truth about whatever burdens them, and Buffy reveals a deep secret to the disappointed gang.  ""Tabula Rasa"" is the episode following this one and is rather humorous as Willow gives the gang amnesia in order to try and stop them from remembering what Buffy reveals in the previous episode.""Gone"" is a neat episode where Buffy goes invisible, perhaps a metaphorical chance to explain the relief of being gone again means to Buffy.  ""Hell's Bells"" is a great episode emotion-wise as the wedding of Anya and Xander goes awry.  ""Normal Again"" is perhaps one of my fave episodes of all time, where Buffy is given a venom that makes her think she is hallucinating about everything that exists in Sunnydale and that she is really a Schizophrenic in a mental ward...who knows maybe she is!  The final four episodes are all linked together in terms of the finale and what the consequences of each characters actions throughout the season leads to, and this time Buffy isn't the be all and end all hero that she ussally is.Overall this is a good season to watch if you are particularly interested in the characters and their development of relationships.  While it doesn't promise the superhero action of previous seasons (and is in particularly stark contrast to Season 5) it will make you appreicate the subtleties and links that are displayed throughout.",5,Looking Back - An Amazing Season,1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,2958,"['lot', 'controversy', 'new', 'direction', 'show', 'took', 'season', 'where', 'focus', 'fighting', 'bad', 'guys', 'lessened', 'theme', 'Consequences', 'real', 'world', 'more', 'played', 'up', 'season', 'relationships', 'characters', 'subsequent', '-consequences-', 'when', 'bonds', 'are', 'broken', 'harmed', 'even', 'formed', 'series', 'take', 'darker', 'turn', 'here', 'based', 'how', 'very', 'powerful', 'season', '5', 'finale', 'Gift', 'only', 'right', 'way', 'goes.When', 'first', 'watching', 'season', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'lack', ""'super-evil"", 'defined', '3', ""'super-geeks"", ""'"", 'Sunnydale', 'Johnathan', 'geek', 'high', 'school', 'Warren', 'robot', 'creator', 'season', '5', 'Andrew', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', 'introduced', 'till', 'season', 'yet', 'back', 'season', '7', 'However', 'season', 'hints', 'are', 'subtly', 'placed', 'real', 'evil', 'Sunnydale', 'more', 'then', 'what', 'leading', 'emotional', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'overly', 'sappy', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'note', 'Season', '6', 'individually', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'singular', 'stand-out', 'episodes', 'even', 'unifying', 'theme', 'supervillan', 'not', 'Most', 'episodes', 'combine', 'dark', 'humor', 'character', 'development', 'terms', 'showing', 'deeper', 'side', 'individual', 'show', 'Life', 'Serial', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'geek', 'trio', 'point', 'out', 'Buffy', ""'weaknesses"", 'forge', 'ahead', 'life', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'one', 'most', 'landmarked', 'episodes', 'series', 'history', 'musical', 'where', 'everyone', 'must', 'tell', 'truth', 'burdens', 'Buffy', 'deep', 'secret', 'disappointed', 'gang', 'Tabula', 'Rasa', 'episode', 'following', 'one', 'rather', 'humorous', 'Willow', 'gang', 'amnesia', 'order', 'try', 'stop', 'remembering', 'what', 'Buffy', 'previous', 'episode', 'Gone', 'neat', 'episode', 'where', 'Buffy', 'invisible', 'perhaps', 'metaphorical', 'chance', 'explain', 'relief', 'being', 'gone', 'again', 'Buffy', 'Hell', 'Bells', 'great', 'episode', 'emotion-wise', 'wedding', 'Anya', 'Xander', 'awry', 'Normal', 'Again', 'perhaps', 'one', 'fave', 'episodes', 'time', 'where', 'Buffy', 'given', 'venom', 'think', 'hallucinating', 'everything', 'Sunnydale', 'really', 'Schizophrenic', 'mental', 'ward', 'who', 'maybe', 'final', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'linked', 'together', 'terms', 'finale', 'what', 'consequences', 'characters', 'actions', 'season', 'time', 'Buffy', ""n't"", 'be', 'end', 'hero', 'ussally', 'is.Overall', 'good', 'season', 'watch', 'are', 'particularly', 'interested', 'characters', 'development', 'relationships', ""n't"", 'promise', 'superhero', 'action', 'previous', 'seasons', 'particularly', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Season', '5', 'will', 'make', 'appreicate', 'subtleties', 'links', 'are', 'displayed']",N/A

But creator Whedon felt that the project never quite did justice to the full scope of his vision, so he managed turn the film into a television series in 1997. The result of Whedon's increased artistic freedom is a series that has enjoyed both critical acclaim and audience notoriety. Nominated for 14 Emmy's during its seven year run, the show managed to win only two (both in 1998 for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Music Composition in a television series). Yet, the true success for Buffy The Vampire Slayer is indicated by the massive success of the show's long run, strong DVD sales, and the overwhelming success of the series spin-off Angel...Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the title role of Buffy Anne Summers, a teenage girl who stands alone among her generation as the ""chosen one"" able to ""stand against vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer..."" But Buffy is not alone in fulfilling her destiny as a slayer of vampires. She also receives help from the high school librarian, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is a Watcher - the one chosen to train and guide slayers on their developmental path. In addition, new friends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan - of American Pie fame) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) quickly uncover the truth of Buffy's destiny, and they often aid her in defending the world against evil forces...The Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 6) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Bargaining: Part 1"" in which the Slayerettes continue to chase after vampires in the aftermath of Buffy's death. Despite Willow's attempts to cover up the Slayer's death, a vampire discovers the truth and tells his friends. While Giles prepares to move away, Willow, Tara, Xander, and Anya perform a spell with the hope of resurrecting Buffy, but when vampires arrive, they must flee before learning if the spell worked or not... Other notable episodes from Season 6 include ""After Life"" in which Buffy, now resurrected by the spell, finds herself craving the peace and solitude of the after life, and ""Wrecked"" in which a spaced out Willow crashes her car while driving via the use of magic instead of her hands...Below is a list of episodes included on the Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 6) DVD:Episode 101 (Bargaining: Part 1)Episode 102 (Bargaining: Part 2)Episode 103 (After Life)Episode 104 (Flooded)Episode 105 (Life Serial)Episode 106 (All the Way)Episode 107 (Once More, With Feeling)Episode 108 (Tabula Rasa)Episode 109 (Smashed)Episode 110 (Wrecked)Episode 111 (Gone)Episode 112 (Doublemeat Palace)Episode 113 (Dead Things)Episode 114 (Older and Far Away)Episode 115 (As You Were)Episode 116 (Hell's Bells)Episode 117 (Normal Again)Episode 118 (Entropy)Episode 119 (Seeing Red)Episode 120 (Villains)Episode 121 (Two to Go)Episode 122 (Grave)The DVD Report",5,An original and uniquely entertaining TV series...,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,3022,"['brainchild', 'writer', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'originally', 'entered', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', 'full-length', 'feature', 'film', 'starring', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', '1992', 'creator', 'Whedon', 'felt', 'project', 'never', 'quite', 'did', 'justice', 'full', 'scope', 'vision', 'managed', 'turn', 'film', 'television', 'series', '1997', 'result', 'Whedon', 'increased', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'audience', 'notoriety', 'Nominated', '14', 'Emmy', 'seven', 'year', 'run', 'show', 'managed', 'win', 'only', 'two', '1998', 'Outstanding', 'Makeup', 'Outstanding', 'Music', 'Composition', 'television', 'series', 'true', 'success', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'indicated', 'massive', 'success', 'show', 'long', 'run', 'strong', 'DVD', 'sales', 'overwhelming', 'success', 'series', 'spin-off', 'Angel', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'title', 'role', 'Buffy', 'Anne', 'Summers', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'alone', 'generation', 'chosen', 'one', 'able', 'stand', 'vampires', 'demons', 'forces', 'darkness', 'Slayer', 'Buffy', 'not', 'alone', 'fulfilling', 'destiny', 'slayer', 'vampires', 'also', 'help', 'high', 'school', 'librarian', 'Rupert', 'Giles', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'who', 'Watcher', 'one', 'chosen', 'train', 'guide', 'slayers', 'developmental', 'path', 'addition', 'new', 'friends', 'Willow', 'Rosenberg', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'American', 'Pie', 'fame', 'Harris', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'quickly', 'truth', 'Buffy', 'destiny', 'often', 'aid', 'defending', 'world', 'evil', 'forces', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Season', '6', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Bargaining', 'Part', '1', 'Slayerettes', 'continue', 'chase', 'vampires', 'aftermath', 'Buffy', 'death', 'Willow', 'attempts', 'cover', 'up', 'Slayer', 'death', 'vampire', 'truth', 'friends', 'Giles', 'move', 'away', 'Willow', 'Tara', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'perform', 'spell', 'hope', 'resurrecting', 'Buffy', 'when', 'vampires', 'arrive', 'must', 'flee', 'learning', 'spell', 'worked', 'not', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '6', 'include', 'Life', 'Buffy', 'now', 'resurrected', 'spell', 'craving', 'peace', 'solitude', 'life', 'Wrecked', 'spaced', 'out', 'Willow', 'crashes', 'car', 'driving', 'use', 'magic', 'instead', 'hands', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Season', '6', 'DVD', 'Episode', '101', 'Bargaining', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '102', 'Bargaining', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '103', 'Life', 'Episode', '104', 'Flooded', 'Episode', '105', 'Life', 'Serial', 'Episode', '106', 'Way', 'Episode', '107', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'Episode', '108', 'Tabula', 'Rasa', 'Episode', '109', 'Smashed', 'Episode', '110', 'Wrecked', 'Episode', '111', 'Gone', 'Episode', '112', 'Doublemeat', 'Palace', 'Episode', '113', 'Dead', 'Things', 'Episode', '114', 'Older', 'Far', 'Away', 'Episode', '115', 'Were', '116', 'Hell', 'Bells', 'Episode', '117', 'Normal', 'Again', 'Episode', '118', 'Entropy', 'Episode', '119', 'Seeing', 'Red', 'Episode', '120', 'Villains', 'Episode', '121', 'Two', 'Go', 'Episode', '122', 'Grave', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A
777563,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,B0000DANYD,Bruce Rux,"[27, 43]","Or, ""Once More, With Rehearsal.""I'm a long-time Buffy fan, and heartily recommend virtually everything about it  -  except this season.  Producer Joss Whedon simply spread himself too thin, devoting almost all his attentions to the musical episode ""Once More, With Feeling""  -  and it shows  -  and to premiering his quickly-failed sci-fi/western series, Firefly.  With Angel taking up the rest of his time, Buffy suffered pretty badly.The opening episodes dealing with Buffy's (Sarah Michelle Gellar) return from the grave are noteworthy, but the season overall finally succumbs to the numerous character and plot inconsistencies that began creeping in during Season Four  -  one of the most notable examples being Buffy's meeting-up with former flame Reilly Finn (Marc Blucas) on an undercover operation that turns out to be against her new flame, Spike (James Marsters); Buffy, the year before, booted Reilly out of her life for sleeping with vampire hookers, but when Reilly discovers Buffy is betraying her mission and her friends by literally sleeping with the enemy, he just laughs it off.The biggest problem with Season Six is that there is no hero  -  or heroine  -  in it.  The resurrected Buffy is a depressed and demoralized slacker with no guts or moral fibre, descending into dehumanizing sleazy sex with her former mortal enemy, Spike, and virtually punting her former career and her friends' trust over the proverbial Hellmouth.  Whatever supposed realism Whedon was attempting to subject his characters to, it falls flat for the very simple reason that no one wants to see their heroes degraded  -  and Season Six degraded Buffy in virtually every single episode.  Her greatest accomplishment of the year is to take on a McJob flipping burgers  -  seriously!The second problem with Season Six is its focus.  Previous years had strong story arcs that played as grand opera.  Season Six plays as soap-opera, from its frequent character inconsistencies to its cheap comedy emphasis.  The production level similarly suffers compared to previous seasons, despite the much-vaunted supposed budget increase per episode.  And  -  for the most part  -  the comedy just isn't funny at all, but rather pathetic, and certainly below the level the series had formerly raised the bar on.  A very unfunny ""funny"" music score is badly overused through much of the season, as if the show itself knows its jokes and situations are flat, and has to cue the audience in that they should be laughing.Thirdly, the villains are sub-par.  In keeping with Buffy's new soap-opera/sitcom thrust, the major villains are three absurd post-high school nerds trying to be super-villains.  They are well-played, admittedly, and may have been worth a few episodes' subplot story arc, but somehow they just seem inappropriate as an entire season's central focus.  Willow (Alyson Hannigan) gets to do a nice star-turn at the end of the season as the interesting but unlikely Big Bad, taking a literal turn to the Dark Side in revenge for the murder of her lover Tara (Amber Benson), but it comes too late in the season to generate sufficient interest, and resolves too quickly for credibility.The season isn't a complete loss, and is at least worth watching for the musical, which is superior.  The characters have always been likeable and sympathetic, and for the most part remain so here, but lose much of their lustre due to bad scripts.  If you're new to Buffy, you might enjoy this season, but if you're a long-time fan and remember when the show was brilliant, Season Six will be a terrible disappointment.  The show would have been much better off concluding with Buffy's death at the end of Season Five  -  but, hey, there was still merchandising in the market, and UPN was willing to pick it up for two more overextended years.

Up until a few months before production, Joss and his band of merry writers pretty much figured that they had put Buffy down. Season 5 was designed to be the end. After all, how many times can you knock someone off before they just stay dead?The overwhelming joy that came you can see in each of what's written for these characters is quite obvious. Admittedly, some of the ""life"" themes we had seen in the past became a little more 'movie of the week' than deep rooted rites of passage. But then again, 'movie of the week' had to come from somewhere.Still taking chances with ""Once more with Feeling"", ""Tabula Rasa"", and ""Dead Things"", you can see the celebration of still having jobs change to ""how much more do we really have to tell about these characters""? I will say though that ""Villains"" was so disturbing...They don't have UPN on my cable and I had to watch these episodes at around 1:00am on my fox affiliate. I called most of my friends and woke them up to see if they were watching and if they hadn't well, I had it on tape and we are all watching it tomorrow.Believe the hype all you want. The fact of the matter is, next to the mayor, no one has been more exciting as a villain then the Trio! God I love those guys.

777565,A33G2XG1S5NSH1,B0000DANYD,"Bryant Burnette ""Bryant Burnette""","[20, 22]","I never watched &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; while it was on the air.  Instead, I picked up the habit on DVD, and have been digesting the show season by season that way.  More than a few people had told me that &quot;Buffy&quot; was great... at least until it got to its sixth season, at which point the show started to suck.  So, after seeing the enormously good fifth season, I was both terribly anxious for the sixth season and a bit apprehensive, because I expected the show to not be as good.Well, that's just not the case.  Out of the twenty-two episodes to be found on this set, not a single one is less than excellent.  There are no episodes that achieve utterly stratospheric levels of awesomeness like, say, &quot;The Body&quot; and &quot;The Gift&quot; do in the fifth season, but a few -- &quot;Once More, With Feeling,&quot; &quot;Tabula Rasa,&quot; and &quot;Gone,&quot; for example -- come very close.From what I can tell, the objections some people have to season six center around three things: (1) that it's depressing, (2) that there isn't really a master villain (such as past seasons had with Angel, the Mayor, Adam, and Glory), and (3) that Giles is only in a few episodes.  These are all legitimate complaints, I suppose, but each can also be refuted, so that's what I'm going to do.  If you haven't seen season five, you might want to quit reading; there will be spoilers for it, but none for the sixth season.Complaint #1: the sixth season is depressing.  Well, how could it not be?  Keep in mind, Buffy died at the end of season five, and when she was brought back, it would be emotionally unrealistic for her to not be totally screwed up for a while.  One way of looking at this season is that it's about the process of Buffy becoming okay with the fact that she is alive and breathing.  And trust me, when you watch the season with that thought in mind, it makes a lot of sense, and has some real weight to it.  Heck, almost every character goes thorugh a similar process: certainly Willow and Xander do, and I'd say that Dawn, Spike, and Anya do, too.  See, the idea is that they are all really becoming adults for the first time, and therefore, the problems they are dealing with are representations of adult problems.  For a lot of people, these problems -- with debt, death, addiction, and despair -- make for depressing viewing, and are not the sort of thing they want to see in a show about funny monsters; but &quot;Buffy&quot; was never about funny monsters.  It WAS always about emotional truth, and thus, season six is not only a logical extension of the show, it's the only place the show could have gone after season five while still retaining the things that made it great in the first place.Complaint #2: there isn't a Big Bad villain for the season.  Not true.  First of all, there's The Trio.  They're silly villains, yes, but they are utterly in keeping with the theme of the season: as is made clear in the special features on the DVD, these pathetic guys who were incapable of growing up were pefect villains in a season that was all about the necessity of growing up.  Perhaps some people also were uncomfortable over the fact that these three guys were sort of a mockery of the type of geeky fanboys who stereotpyically gravitate toward shows like &quot;Star Trek,&quot; &quot;Babylon 5,&quot; and, um, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot;  I'm one of those guys, and it doesn't bother me, so it shouldn't bother you, either.  Really, though, the Big Bad of the season is to be found within each of the main characters: Buffy is fighting herself, Willow is fighting herself, Xander is fighting himself, so forth and so on.  I don't want to be too specific; it'd give away too many things that should remain surprising.  This element of inner struggle, to me, is much more interesting than would have been yet another demon bent on the destruction of the world.  &quot;Buffy&quot; had done that before, several times; here, the creators decided to do something different.  For some people, it didn't work, but I think those were people who weren't paying very close attention.Complaint #3: there's not enough Giles.  Well, Giles has always been the father figure on the show, not only for Buffy, but for Willow and Xander, as well, when you think about it.  And if the season is about the three of them growing into adulthood, it makes sense for them to do so with their father figure absent.  Again, it is a creative move designed to strengthen the season overall, and it works.  Also, when Giles IS around, he is absolutely awesome.  There is one scene in particular in which he is pretty much the coolest thing ever.  Trust me; you'll see.My final opinion of this season is that it's the best one yet.  It's hard to get better than seasons three and five, but this one does it.  It isn't necessarily the most happy story ever told, but since when is that a prerequisite for goodness?The DVDs themselves are good; the video quality is excellent, and the audio is very good for television.  The image is full-frame, with the exception of &quot;Once More, With Feeling,&quot; which is letterboxed.  Sadly, Fox did not see fit to anamorphically enhance that episode, which sucks if you have a widescreen TV; but that's no reason not to buy the discs, and if you have a standard TV, like me, you'll never know the difference.  The bonus features are pretty good, with several interesting documentaries, including a behind-the-scenes look at the musical episode and a retrospective of the entire series that even (gasp!) includes interviews with Sarah Michelle Gellar, who normally skips that sort of thing.  Best of all is the Joss Whedon commentary track on &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot;; he does commentaries better than anyone else I can think of.Highly, highly, highly recommended.",5,no suck in

777566,A3T8G3FN3H3948,B0000DANYD,bryhil_04,"[11, 13]","The season consisted of 22 episodes, some very strong, some good, and barely above average(the weak ones). Lets start out with a review of the season. Though, this season might be one of the strongest, on an episode basis, the story arc is one of the weakest because 3 nerds using magic was funny, but not nearly as clever as the season 2 story arc, with Angel going bad, season 1 with The Master and his annointed one, Faith, the rogue slayer and The Mayor or the most clever one, the hellgod and her search for her key. But in saying that, the season had many clever ideas which I will go through.Bargaining: 5/5 The disc features the whole 2-parter with a scene that wasn't shown in the original airing. It's right before Buffy bot and Dawn are at school, they have them walking there and having a chat which is very funny, with a guy. The episode gets everything kicked off for the season, Willow is going heavy into her magic, bringing back Buffy, Tara is on her side, which symbolizes the last couple of seasons, because Tara won't be on Willow's side later on. Xander and Anya continue to worry about each other, Anya wishing to come out with their engagement, while Xander doesn't think it's the right time. Dawn is learning to take a little more responsibility and Giles leaves feeling his job is done as a watcher. It's a great starting episode and there is enough action to keep you on your feet.Afterlife: 4/5 Buffy is still dealing with coming back from her grave and tells the gang that's she's okay, but reveals to Spike that she thinks she's in hell now, and she was better off where she was... in heaven. Meanwhile, a demon Willow made while bringing back Buffy, is taking over their bodies now and then.Flooded: 4.5/5 Shows more of Buffy's struggle to keep the home in tact, provide a good life for Dawn, also enters the villains of the season: the Trio. Only this is a much funnier side, unlike the last episode. And Giles returns after Willow calls and tells him that Buffy's alive once more. But Giles is very upset because of the risks Willow took in bringing Giles back.Life Serial: 5/5 Buffy now struggles at getting into College, working, getting some money into the house. And the only thing that makes her happy is Spike, for some unknown reason. The Trio aren't any help, as they each take her on, test by test and win. Buffy is happy that Giles is there, but Giles doubts he'll be there for her much longer.All the Way: 3.5/5 Dawn sneaks out on Hallowe'en, her way of rebelling. And she ends up with a couple of vamps, where Giles is the first to get to her. Then Buffy and the gang rescue her. Xander and Anya come out with their engagement, where everyone is happy for them. Tara and Willow start their fighting and Willow does a spell to make them get along.Once More, with Feeling: 5/5 Oh, the musical. It's one of the best episodes, showing Tara and Giles are feeling left out, and Tara is gets upset when she finds out Willow used another spell, now forcing Tara to leave Willow. Buffy & Spike share their first kiss, and Xander makes a giant booboo. Buffy confesses to the gang in song that she was in heaven. Now, the voices, Sarah and Nick, their weakest singers, who have little range at all, but sing within it so its not hideous at all. Michelle and Alyson, a little better, but they don't have enough singing lines to make them sound bad. Emma is a good singer, but not as great as Amber Benson, Anthony Stewart Head and James Marters, that's the real talent and they make this episode worth watching! The rest of them are just funny, like Xander, Anya and Willow!Tabula Rasa: 5/5 Funny episode, they all lose their memories when Willow tries another spell to make Tara forget about Willow's addiction to magic, and Buffy to forget she was ever in heaven. Only, it goes wrong and the whole gang loses their memories. Tara leaves Willow after she fails to deliver on a promise, again. Giles leaves town. Michelle Branch performs a real live performance at the end, and Buffy & Spike share their 2nd kiss.Smashed: 4.5/5 Spike thinks there's something wrong with his chip because he can hurt Buffy without his chip going off, so he goes to Warren and the rest of the Trio for help.Wrecked: 4.5/5 Willow continues her addiction to magic, after bringing back Amy of all those years she was a rat. And after Willow nearly kills Dawn, she decides to quit magic entirely. Buffy & Spike start their romance.Gone: 4.5/5 Andrew accidentally turns Buffy invincible and Buffy meets the Trio for the first time.Double Meat Palace: 2.5/5 Not fussy on this episode, Buffy gets a job at a place that is less then sane.Dead Things: 4/5 Funny, the Trio find a way to make Buffy think she murdered Katrina, Warren's ex-girlfriend. Buffy joins Spike in the dark.Older and Far Away: 4/5 Another pretty funny episode, centered around Dawn as she accidentally makes a wish because she feels she's un-noticed, something alot of teens go through. And a demon Buffy thought she killed tries to kill them all.As You Were: 3.5/5 The closing to the Buffy/Riley relationship and Buffy/Spike relationship. As Buffy realizes that there is a light, and Riley is the one that shows her. He takes off again with his wife after the succesfully destroy the nest that Spike was holding.Hell's Bells: 4/5 Xander and Anya's not wedding. Xander is afraid that he might be like his father, and he doesn't want to hurt Anya like that so he leaves her at the altar.Normal Again: 4.5/5 Buffy gets close to finding the Trio, so they make a demon that poisins her and that makes her believe she's in a mental institution. Anya isn't in this episode.Entropy: 4/5 The conclusion the love triangle between Xander/Anya/Buffy/Spike. Anya is back into Vengeance.Seeing Red: 5/5 One of the most violent, serious and entertaining episodes. Spike tries to rape Buffy, which was very degrading and hard to watch. He later skips town. Xander gets mad at Buffy for sleeping with Spike. But later comes back to apologize. Johnathan and Andrew are put behind bars as Warren seeks out for his revenge. Willow and Tara get back together just as Warren ends their relationship when he accidentally kills Tara, but fails to purposely kill the slayer, with a gun.Villains: 5/5 Willow goes on a vengeance streak and gets all black-haired, looking to kill Warren. Buffy, Xander & Anya are forced to stop her.Two to Go: 5/5 The battle between Willow and Buffy lasts about 10 minutes, and after Willow finds Anya chanting to keep it her from performing spells on anyone but herself, Willow knocks out Anya and Buffy, preparing for the kill when Giles comes in to save them.Grave: 5/5 The final battles, where Willow defeats Giles and takes his power, setting out to destroy the world. Buffy and Dawn start getting along as they fight for their lives. Johnathan and Andrew are gone now. And Xander saves the world by talking down Willow. Giles lives and heads back to England with a grieving Willow. Spike gets his soul back!Special Features- 5/5 I wish I could go over all of it, but I only have so much space and time. There's a Season Six Overview(simplistic), commentary's for Bargaining, Once More, with Feeling, Smashed, Hell's Bells, Normal Again and Grave.Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Panel Discussion is with 4 of the Buffy cast members, Nic Brendan, Alyson Hannigan, Michelle Trachtenberg and James Marsters.A Behind the scenes look at Once More, with Feeling.

Buffy feels like something is wrong with her because she starts sleeping with spike and falls in love with him.

Buffy and mostly everyone else get jobs, dawn wants to start dating(making out with a vamp) ect... The season was  my favorite,and they had better effect, like in the last three episode, when willow goes crazy. Buffy also has great fighting sense, like always! The last episodes were great because you get to see willows bad side, and she fights Buffy and Giles. It ends with another great appocalipse, whom xander stoped this time.....

777568,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B0000DANYD,Busy Body,"[7, 12]","With Season Five of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Joss Whedon and his team of writers and producers proved that they could expand the show by forcing the characters to grow up and learn everything about life's lessons. So with Season Six, the task was to show what can happen once you've achieved the knowledge you desired before you had it. Our beloved characters are taken all the way down to rock bottom to show that they are indeed human just like everyone else. The effort and determination is shown throughout ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Sixth Season,"" which was snubbed by many fans, but was definitely one that no one could ignore.Season Five's heartbreaking finale saw Buffy sacrifice her own life in order to save her sister Dawn and the world from destruction. The future of the show is in turmoil for viewers, but we are soon given answers. Not much has changed since the last time we saw them. Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Tara (Amber Benson) are still together, but have moved into Buffy's house to look after Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg). Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Anya (Emma Caulfield) are happily engaged to be wed later in the season. Giles (Anthony Stewart-Head) is wondering if he is still really needed in Sunnydale, while Spike (James Marsters) is still lurking around the town and brooding over the death of the slayer. It sounds depressing, and it is - the Buffy Bot that first made its presence in Season Five is still active and is being used by the Scoobies to fool the evil nasties of Sunnydale into thinking it's still Buffy, alive and well.In the two-part season opener, ""Bargaining Part 1"" and ""Bargaining Part 2,"" Buffy is brought back to life by Willow and the gang. However, they fail to understand that a sacrifice taken back is a sacrifice negated, and soon find themselves haunted by other-worldly apparitions in ""Afterlife."" After tears, tantrums and make ups, life returns to normal for the Slayer except she believes that she was in Heaven and torn out by her friends, who believed she was in Hell. ""Flooded"" and ""Life Serial"" sees Buffy trying to do ordinary things like fix bust water pipes and holding down a job. These episodes bring us the seasons' main story arc. The Trio consists of Warren (Adam Busch), Andrew (Tom Lenk) and Jonathan (Danny Strong). Together they work together on some ludicrous plot to overthrow the Slayer and rule Sunnydale in a storyline which focuses more on humour and comedy more so than thrilling action. Their first few missions include using a freeze gun to steal a diamond from a museum (""Smashed"") and accidentally turning Buffy invisible with their latest gadget (""Gone"").Things get more serious as the season progresses as their need for domination and power takes over their lives. In ""Dead Things"" Warren accidentally kills his ex-girlfriend, and frames Buffy for the murder. Later on in ""Normal Again"" they unleash a demon on Buffy which makes her believe that her friends are just figments of her imagination and that she has spent most of her teenage life in an insane asylum. Things finally crumble in ""Seeing Red"" when Warren shoots Buffy in her back yard, almost killing her. A stray bullet flies throw the bedroom window and hits Tara suddenly, killing her instantly. This turns Willow evil and sees her out to get her revenge on the three nerds in the spectacular final episodes of the season, ""Villains,"" ""Two To Go"" and ""Grave."" Willow has just got back together with Tara in the previous episode after they split up earlier in the season when Tara left her due to her magic addiction. When Willow jeopardises Dawn's life in ""Wrecked"" after becoming hooked on a warlock's magical powers, she vows to quit magic. She's doing fine until Tara is shot, and everything turns upside down.As previously stated, Season Six focuses on lives and relationships and none are more shocking than the one between Buffy and Spike. After Spike admitted his love for the Slayer in Season Five, Buffy turns up the heat in Season Six by having casual sex on a regular basis with Spike in episodes such as ""Doublemeat Palace."" It's something she wouldn't normal do, but she finds herself feeling that she needs to force her emotions. She ends this later on in the season, but Spike tragically rapes her in ""Seeing Red,"" in one of the most disturbing and horrific scenes of the entire series. Riley returns for one episode in ""As You Were,"" along with his new wife. Willow and Tara break up, then make up before being eternally separated. Xander is too blind to see that he's not ready for married life, before fleeing the alter in ""Hells Bells,"" leaving Anya devastated. She reverts to being a vengeance demon once more and wreaks havoc on Xander's emotions in ""Entropy."" Dawn feels the need for more attention and begins to steal things from the Magic Box. As the centre of attention in Season Five, she craves more in the season and doesn't get it before Buffy figures out her younger sister's pleas in ""Older And Far Away.""The real gems of Season Six come in the form of ""Once More, With Feeling"" and ""Tabula Rasa."" The former is the much-hyped musical episode and is a masterpiece in modern television. Simply put the episode is an Emmy-nominated phenomenon and will go down in history. The latter is the funniest episode of the season where the gang all forget who they are, but beneath lies a much darker topic which involves Willow and her unstoppable addiction to the dark arts.All in all Season Six of Buffy the Vampire Slayer may not have been one in which the show had some of the best episodes, but it is definitely the boldest of all the seasons. The characters go to dark places that even the biggest of fans would have never though of, and it's all to prove that they are human beings like the rest of us, and that they can overcome their troubles, mistakes and fears to grow and evolve as proper adults. Take a chance and watch this season. Even if you don't like it you will be touched by it, and that's something.",5,Moving Into Bold New Territory,1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,6014,"['Season', 'Five', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer',

777570,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0000DANYD,calvinnme,"[9, 9]","In season six of Buffy, the darkness that permeated the last half of season five continues. At the beginning of the season, Willow uses magic to bring Buffy, who was killed by mystical energy at the end of season five, back to life. The Scoobies do this assuming that Buffy's soul has been trapped in a hell dimension since her death, not realizing that she has in fact been in heaven. Life on this earthly plane seems harsh and violent and at the same time mundane to Buffy, who feels she must hide the fact that her friends have ripped her out of eternal peace. Initially, only Spike knows her secret, and the first few episodes of the season deal with Buffy trying to get back to ""normal"", which is made considerably difficult by the fact that she is still the slayer even though she has lost her zest for her duties, and also that she is financially broke due to the fact that her late mother's medical bills consumed any life insurance and savings that she had left Buffy. Episode seven, ""Once More With Feeling"", the musical episode of Buffy, is in my opinion the best episode of the series ever. During this episode, a musical demon causes the Scoobies to pour out their true emotions in song, causing much conflict within the group and basically setting up the remainder of the season.Throughout the rest of the season, many interesting subplots arise. As for the Spike/Buffy relationship, fans either hate it or love it. In my opinion, Spike and Buffy have one of the most complex and compelling relationships ever captured on screen. Buffy is drawn to Spike post-resurrection in an attempt to feel something - anything - even if it is disgust for herself. Spike is sick with love for Buffy to the point of risking his undead life to regain his soul which he believes will cause her to be his once and for all. Throughout the season there is the presence of the trio of nerds that at first just perform mischievous pranks with Buffy as the target, but gradually become more ambitious in their endeavors until one of their experiments end in the unintended death of an innocent person. Many people are annoyed by the trio as the ""big bad"" of season six. However, I think that their presence is meant to be in stark contrast to Spike, who at the end of the season does the right thing in seeking his soul although he has no moral compass, while the souled Warren of the nerd trio is capable of greatest evil possible with no remorse.A parallel thread throughout season six is the disintegration of Tara and Willow's relationship, as Tara finds that Willow has become so corrupted by the power of her magic that she is willing to alter Tara's perception of reality in order to keep her under control. The two are ultimately reunited, and many fans have found the senseless death of Tara shortly thereafter to be their ""jump the shark"" moment for Buffy. However, since this whole season seems to be about confronting the dark reality of adult life, I think that it was appropriate to confront the topic of the senseless sudden death of a good person at the hands of an evil person. What made Tara's death particularly horrific for me was that the shot that kills her is not even a deliberate act. Instead it is simply a random shot taken as a villain is leaving the scene of a crime. Willow's grief boils over into rage for the murderer, and this launches the final arc in which she wreaks vengeance on the perpetrator with an orgy of magic. This does not end her pain, however, and she ultimately decides to use her power to end not only her own suffering, but the suffering of everybody on earth. Only the unconditional love of Xander is ultimately able to stop her, and pull her back from the brink of destruction. This is particularly sweet, as it echoes the theme throughout the show about Xander, a normal guy with no particular mystical powers or knowledge always the steadfast friend to those who do have such powers.Although I really enjoyed this season as what I think is a necessary continuation of season five, I did think that the dialogue was not as crisp in this season as it had been in past seasons, and that there was some inconsistency in the writing that somewhat detracted from what was otherwise a five star season of Buffy.",4,Wonderful exploration of dark themes,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,4251,"['season', 'six', 'Buffy', 'darkness', 'permeated', 'last', 'half', 'season', 'five', 'beginning', 'season', 'Willow', 'magic', 'bring', 'Buffy', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'mystical', 'energy', 'end', 'season', 'five', 'back', 'life', 'Scoobies', 'do', 'assuming', 'Buffy', 'soul', 'been', 'trapped', 'hell', 'dimension', 'death', 'not', 'realizing', 'fact', 'been', 'heaven', 'Life', 'earthly', 'plane', 'harsh', 'violent', 'same', 'time', 'mundane', 'Buffy', 'who', 'must', 'hide', 'fact', 'friends', 'have', 'ripped', 'eternal', 'peace', 'Initially', 'only', 'Spike', 'secret', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'deal', 'Buffy', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'made', 'considerably', 'difficult', 'fact', 'still', 'slayer', 'even', 'lost', 'zest', 'duties', 'also', 'financially', 'broke', 'due', 'fact', 'late', 'mother', 'medical', 'bills', 'consumed', 'life', 'insurance', 'savings', 'had', 'left', 'Buffy', 'Episode', 'seven', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'musical', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'opinion', 'best', 'episode', 'series', 'ever', 'episode', 'musical', 'demon', 'Scoobies', 'pour', 'out', 'true', 'emotions', 'song', 'causing', 'much', 'conflict', 'group', 'basically', 'setting', 'up', 'remainder', 'season.Throughout', 'rest', 'season', 'many', 'interesting', 'subplots', 'arise', 'Spike/Buffy', 'relationship', 'fans', 'hate', 'love', 'opinion', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'compelling', 'relationships', 'ever', 'captured', 'screen', 'Buffy', 'drawn', 'Spike', 'post-resurrection', 'attempt', 'feel', 'something', 'anything', 'even', 'disgust', 'herself', 'Spike', 'sick', 'love', 'Buffy', 'point', 'risking', 'undead', 'life', 'regain', 'soul', 'will', 'cause', 'be', 'once', 'season', 'presence', 'trio', 'nerds', 'first', 'just', 'perform', 'mischievous', 'pranks', 'Buffy', 'target', 'gradually', 'become', 'more', 'ambitious', 'endeavors', 'one', 'experiments', 'end', 'unintended', 'death', 'innocent', 'person', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'annoyed', 'trio', 'big', 'bad', 'season', 'six', 'However', 'think', 'presence', 'meant', 'be', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Spike', 'who', 'end', 'season', 'right', 'thing', 'seeking', 'soul', 'moral', 'compass', 'souled', 'Warren', 'nerd', 'trio', 'capable', 'greatest', 'evil', 'possible', 'remorse.A', 'parallel', 'thread', 'season', 'six', 'disintegration', 'Tara', 'Willow', 'relationship', 'Tara', 'Willow', 'become', 'so', 'corrupted', 'power', 'magic', 'willing', 'alter', 'Tara', 'perception', 'reality', 'order', 'keep', 'control', 'two', 'are', 'ultimately', 'reunited', 'many', 'fans', 'have', 'found', 'senseless', 'death', 'Tara', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'be', 'jump', 'shark', 'moment', 'Buffy', 'However', 'whole', 'season', 'be', 'confronting', 'dark', 'reality', 'adult', 'life', 'think', 'was', 'appropriate', 'confront', 'topic', 'senseless', 'sudden', 'death', 'good', 'person', 'hands', 'evil', 'person', 'What', 'made', 'Tara', 'death', 'particularly', 'horrific', 'was', 'shot', 'not', 'even', 'deliberate', 'act', 'Instead', 'simply', 'random', 'shot', 'taken', 'villain', 'leaving', 'scene', 'crime', 'Willow', 'grief', 'over', 'rage', 'murderer', 'final', 'arc', 'vengeance', 'perpetrator', 'orgy', 'magic', 'not', 'end', 'pain', 'however', 'ultimately', 'use', 'power', 'end', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'suffering', 'suffering', 'everybody', 'earth', 'Only', 'unconditional', 'love', 'Xander', 'ultimately', 'able', 'stop', 'pull', 'back', 'brink', 'destruction', 'particularly', 'sweet', 'theme', 'show', 'Xander', 'normal', 'guy', 'particular', 'mystical', 'powers', 'knowledge', 'always', 'steadfast', 'friend', 'who', 'do', 'have', 'such', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'what', 'think', 'necessary', 'continuation', 'season', 'five', 'did', 'think', 'dialogue', 'was', 'not', 'crisp', 'season', 'had', 'been', 'past', 'seasons', 'was', 'inconsistency', 'writing', 'somewhat', 'detracted', 'what', 'was', 'otherwise', 'five', 'star', 'season', 'Buffy']",N/A

I thought it was way too depressing. And the whole Buffy sleeping with Spike was way too much for me too handle. Buffy likes to get punched and punch Spike back before having sex? Not good. It works for porn maybe but not in my tv show. And I LOVE porn! Go figure.  All the characters seemed depressed and about ready for prozac. I wanted prozac!Why the 1 star rating? Only for the ""Once More With Feeling"" episode. I am SO TIRED of hearing these brain warped, and horny women saying ""Season 6 of Buffy was the best! And Spike and Buffy are the greatest couple EVER!"" Sorry troubled women but no. They are not the greatest couple. They wreak! James Marsters is a great actor but his character DOES NOT belong with Buffy.Many Spike fans believed that Buffy treated him badly in season 6. Used Spike as a punching bag but yet they want Buffy shagging him. Does that make sense? Not to me.Buffy season 6 was more depressing than ""Dark"". Season 3 and moreso season 5 were dark. But season 6 was a prozac worthy season. Spike was never the hero almost every fan thought/thinks he was in season 6. He's the ANTIHERO. So what part don't you guys get? He didn't help Buffy in season 4-5 because he has a kind heart, it was because he didn't want Buffy to dust him. He had a chip implanted in his dead brain so he couldn't harm humans anymore (thanks to The Initiative in season 4) so in order for Buffy not to stake him he reluctantly helped her. Spike does NOT know what true love is. Spike stalked Buffy in season 5, stole articles of clothing, stole photos of her and built a shrine of Buffy in his underground crypt. That's NOT love! It's a sick twisted obsession. Wow what goes on in the mind of Joss Whedon? Spike knows Buffy could never love him. He tries raping her and tries killing a woman the minute he thinks the chip isn't working. Why do women love this anorexic peroxide blonde so much? Women are scary if they think that a misogynstic vampire is the best thing since sliced pizza. And this is coming from a gay male! We are supposed to love ALL men! It just makes me wonder. I don't like Spike (funny huh?). I never did. (Although I loved him on Angel he was away from Buffy) He is a ripoff of the true original vampire with a soul. the tall, dark, brooding and handsome Angel played wonderfully by David Boreanaz.

Afterwards, I was unsure as to whether I really wanted to make the trip to Best Buy and purchase Season Six.  I knew it was going to be dark, and full of depression and regression of soul, but, I had to do it anyway...  And I'm glad I did so.I can't say this is the best season of the series (5 and 3 probably take that cake), but it does contain many great great episodes, including ""After Life"", ""Doublemeat Palace"", ""Smashed"", ""Once More With Feeling"", ""Wrecked"", ""Normal Again"", ""Seeing Red"", ""Villains"", ""Two to Go"", and ""Grave"".  Despite the pending apocalypse, and its very surprising perpetrator, the big bad isn't quite what we might have imagined it to be, but it does make the series fold more to a realism.  The Big Bad this time is life itself, and all the new steps our main characters had to take, and wisking through their failures with passion and tears, but learning with each experience.There has been certain growth as seasons went on.  Buffy had come to terms with being the Slayer, Xander got away from living in his parents basement and got on his own two feet, and Willow learned to become more secure with herself.  But all that growth had to find new growth when Buffy died and was revived by Willow.  With Xander's imminent marriage, Buffy coming to terms with actually being alive, and having to take responsibility for a house and a sister, and Willow coming to terms with her magical abilities and lesbian love, how can we stop the growth, and keep the show alive, yet retain some sort of realistic life lesson?  It's impossible.  These guys are just passed adolescence, and learning to live life, and now realizing how much they took for granted.  This season was very necessary for the growth of all the characters.I don't recommend this for anyone under the age of 13, because of the sexual provocation, and more adult-like themes.  I found this to be more realistic, but may not be appropriate for your 11 or 12 year old.  It's not like the show is advocating sexual irresponsibility, and whatever, but it's just a suggestion.  This season plays at your emotions, tickles your dark side, and makes you realize that the heroes, the Scoobies, really are sensitive human beings, who finally have their own personal demons to contend with.So sit down, open your mind, and allow this VERY underrated season into your heart.

777576,AUPYKCIQEITAS,B0000DANYD,Cinephile,"[20, 22]","Too dark. Too depressing. Too many dark character arcs. Too kinky, too many nerdy villains, no compelling &quot;big bad,&quot; what's up with spike, and, well-- too dark.Does that cover the list of complaints? Am I forgetting anything? Lord only knows, Buffy-holics can be fierce, persnickity taskmasters (particularly the online folk), and I wouldn't want to miss a single nitpick.Season Six of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is easily the most divisive of the show's seven-year run (to paraphrase a wise swampland muppet, there is only love or no love-- there is no try). It is also one of the show's very best, and listening to the litany of concerns that even the most devoted fans have with this season brings to mind the exchange between Woody Allen and the aliens in STARDUST MEMORIES: &quot;We love your films. Particularly the earlier, funnier ones.&quot;Series creator/auteur Joss Whedon has stated in numerous interviews that BUFFY was designed to be loved and adored beyond all reason, and as its spin-off ANGEL finally reached its magnificent conclusion a few weeks ago, bringing to a close the stories of what fans affectionately refer to as &quot;the Buffyverse&quot; (or the WhedonVerse)-- and leaving fans of quality television bereft in a universe of soul-sucking reality television and jeffy foxworthy-- it's clear that Whedon succeeded beyond his wildest expectations. Spin-offs, novelizations, comics, videogames, action figures, ep guides, conferences, conventions, oodles of websites and at least a dozen academic collections testify to the intense feeling fans had for the program.I mention this because it's impossible for me to separate my appreciation and understanding of the events of season six from this fan culture, and that culture's divided response. At the end of season five, contract disputes with the WB led to the show's departure from that network, and its debut on UPN.  Without wanting to give away any plot twists, I'd like to propose that season six -- in addition to offering heartbreaking drama, hilarious comedy, and the single best musical in recent memory-- also acts as a kind of metacommentary on both network politics (the show's characters going through the same kinds of growing pains as the program itself went through in moving to a new home) and, much more daringly, on the dangers and limitations of fanboyism.What does that mean? Well, watch the box and we'll talk (no spoilers, remember, although I'm dying to tell you about this moment when...and then it turns out it's his sled...and...).  Suffice to say that, even for a show as consistently risky and daring in its tonal shifts, stylistic pastiches and character arcs as BUFFY, Season Six finds Whedon and Co. pushing everyone to their limits. Yes, it's dark, although even a quick perusal of the previous five seasons suggests that darkness has always been a key element in BUFFY (she *is* a vampire slayer, after all). Yes, there are scary, depressing things that happen (although anyone who's sat through Buffy Season Two should be prepared for that possibility). Characters change, relationships alter, and not everything conforms to the formula of good/evil that had been established (and also played with, deconstructed) over the previous seasons.But guess what? This sort of ambiguity has been part of the BUFFY make-up since the first season.  It was clear, at least since Season Two, that the show was not going to be the campfest that its title (and forgettable movie parent) suggested, and that, under the guise of a &quot;teen show,&quot; Whedon and Co. were going to deliver some of the richest, most complex emotions on TV.Too dark, too depressing, too kinky-- and yet, upon reflection, everything that happens in Season Six is a logical outgrowth of what had come before.  Pulling the rug out from under fan expectations has been one of the show's hallmarks from the first epsiode, and previous years have seen shocking plot twists, from an extreme makeover of a key character in season two, to the surprise arrival of another in season five.  One of the joys of Buffy has been the show's willingness to thwart expectation and push character and audience alike to new and strange emotional places (inevitably, once the outrage dies down, fans look back on these arc-altering episodes nostalgically).  The writers do so gracefully, wittily, movingly and logically-- the changes never seem like just a stunt-- and it's to the writers' credit that they trusted their audience enough to, after six years, take them to even harder places (given the difficulties many had, the writers arguably trusted them too much).  Better that than another police procedural regurgitation where NOTHING EVER CHANGES.Remember, too, a crucial component of the BuffyVerse's success-- hope (no shadow without light).  As a show with the word &quot;slayer&quot; in the title would suggest, there has been violence and pain in the show's run, but never nihilism, the kind of flip, darkness-for-its-own-sake conservatism that infects the work of Alan  (SIX FEET UNDER) Ball, for instance.  The difficulties and consequences the show's characters face are always mixed with humor, whether it's a throwaway joke or a full-scale musical episode (the masterful &quot;Once More With Feeling,&quot; the single best thing on television during the 2001-2002 season).  Ultimately, it is that hope that justifies all of the darkness of the season, and when the characters reach a kind of understanding and grace in the season's final minutes, it is an extraordiarily moving capstone to a magnificent six-year run (don't get me started on the painfully disappointing seventh year, there's no time...).Too dark, too depressing, too kinky-- and as cancellations and reality gluts are apparently proving, too damn cool for contemporary television.",5,dark shadows john wells and the WB can only dream of,1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,5830,"['Too', 'dark', 'Too',

I find allways that difficult is better... and this was a difficult season to watch. The writers took the characters to their darkest possible places. The storylines are, as follows: Buffy is returned from heaven by Willow, Xander, Anya and Tara, but she is unable to adjust herself to being on earth again. Everything hurts her. Her only way to feel alive is to take her body to the limit, and she can do that (being a slayer, who is used to fights and physical stress) only by using Spike, sexually. Willow finds herself falling into a magic ""addiction"", which even makes her endanger Dawn and break up with Tara. By the end of the season she'll learn that repression was not the way to go, and that it can take her to destroy the world. Xander's unsaid doubts about getting married with Anya finally explode and he leaves her right before the wedding, making her go back to being a vengeance demon. Giles finds that his presence is holding Buffy back, so he decides to go to England, even against Buffy's wishes. Dawn is unable to find herself in the midst of this entire chaos, so she turns to theft in order to make herself adequate to the group, and to call for help. By the end of the season, of course, everything comes together to create a perfect finalle for the year, in which the group falls appart (pretty much from Enthropy) and it is the end of the world... again.This season will have many of the most memorable moments of the series for me: Spike trying to rape Buffy is priceless, and it is so perfectly done: the angles... the frame... the abscence of music... they really achieved a perfect moment. Warren falling in the hands of Willow. Anya walking alone down the altar. The entire Once more, with feeling episode. Buffy trying to kill he friends in order to gain sanity. The entire two final episodes of the season. Willow hurting Xander as he tries to save her and the world. Tara and Buffy getting shot by Warren. Buffy and Spike bringing down the house as they ""make love"".This season contains:Bargaining I & II: Buffy is brought back, while a bunch of demons terrorize Sunnydale. 9.8.Afterlife: Buffy has brought something along with her. 9.6Flooded: Buffy is broke. The troika makes its appearance. 9.4Life serial: Buffy is tested by the nerds. 9.7All the way: Dawn falls for a kid with nocturnal habits. 9Once More, with feeling: What can be said about this one? 10Tabula Rasa: A spell gone wrong makes everyone forget everything. 10Smashed: Spike learns he can hurt Buffy and Willow brings back Amy. 10Wrecked: Willow falls in the hands of a warlock. 10Gone: Buffy, the invisible vampire slayer. 9.6Double-meat Palace: Buffy has a new job. 8.5Dead things: Buffy tries to find out why Spike can hurt her... she must have something wrong. 9Older and far away: While celebrating Buffy's birthday, everyone gets trapped in the house. 9.7As you were: Riley's return leads to the end of Buffy's relationship with Spike. 8.5Hell's Bells: Xander's and Anya's wedding. 9.8Normail Again: Is everything just a delusion? 10Entropy: Anya seeks vengeance against Xander... but she only finds sollace in Spike. 10Seeing Red: The trio finds a huge source of power. 10Villians: With Buffy and Tara being shot, Willow spins out of control and looks for Warren in order to punish him. 10Two to go: Buffy and Xander must protect Jonathan and Andrew from Willow. 10Grave: Giles return to stop Willow, but he only gives her the power to end the world. 10I think that this season can be more cherished watching in DVD.

777580,A2OSERGXBYMPJ0,B0000DANYD,C. T. Mikesell,"[4, 7]","In one of the bonus documentaries in this 6-disc set, Buffy creator Joss Whedon explains that ""Life is the big bad of Season 6."" Among other things, this means that the Scooby Gang faces down challenges like addiction, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, career choices, rape, etc. The creativity of the writers and directors keep it from becoming one long ""After-School Special,"" but about halfway through the season I began feeling run-down and weary myself.That's not to say that there aren't some standout episodes in Season 6. The episodes ""Once Again With Feeling"" and ""Normal Again"" are among the best of the show. The ""Trio"" poses a new kind of villain - one that Buffy can contain, but not kill - even if they lack the menace of Spike & Dru or Glory. Not everything is great, but even the weaker entries - ""Doublemeat Palace,"" for instance - have their shining moments.To my mind, the only drawback to Season 6 is the ""Moonlighting-ization"" that takes place (i.e., the switch from independent stand-alone episodes to three or four episode mini-arcs that pick up immediately after the one previous). While each episode still has some self-contained plot-element(s), there isn't any breathing room between episodes to gain perspective (maybe that's part of Joss' Life-as-the-big-bad theme; maybe I'm still hanging onto baggage from the decline of the Bruce Willis/Cybill Shepherd series). This change in storytelling technique carries over into Season 7, too. While it helps the show finish the stories it wants to tell, I wish they could have found another method of getting the job done.The set includes the usual mix of documentaries and episode commentaries, as well as outtakes and a DVD-ROM ""Demon Guide.""

777583,A8LT66GHJAOQY,B0000DANYD,"destiny morna ""destiny21""","[7, 8]","Season 6 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (BtVS) was much maligned, often hated and generally misunderstood by a lot of Buffy fans.  But on second viewing, this season proves to be just as compelling as past seasons.  And this DVD shows us why we viewers should give season 6 another chance...plus the worse episode of BtVS (DMP) is better than most of the average TV shows out there!  Here are my reasons why season 6 deserves a second look.1.  BtVS is a series based on continuity, characters and their relationships with each other, never more evident than in this season.  The comfortable roles/relationships that viewers were used to were strained, tested, stretched and even broken on season 6 as they never were before.  Characters that we loved were lost (Tara/Giles).  Other did reprehensible things (Spike/Willow).  Our heroine descended into depression and despair.  Old favorites were reintroduced with surprising results (Riley, Amy,Jonathan).2.  BtVS has always been about short and long term story arcs. Viewing episodes together on DVD ties these arcs in much more closely than viewing new episodes sporadically, with weeks in between and with repeats as oftens happens on TV.  The longer season arcs sometimes get lost on TV.  Plus, there are season spanning arcs that come to fruition on season 6 (Buffy's death, Willow's descent into the dark arts--were predicted in earlier seasons).3.  Season 6 boasted some of the best episodes and moments in Buffy series history.  Once more with Feeling (OMWF) is widely regarded as the best episode- and when it came out, was the year's best hour on television.  Tabula Rasa pops up on most everyone's list of most humorous.  Giles' learning of Buffy's return and their reunion is one of the shows most touching moments.  Buffy and Spike's attempted Rape scene (Seeing Red) was one of the most controversial scenes for fans.  Normal Again gave us a thoughtful ""what if"" scenario--what if this were all a dream?4.  Season 6 shows us a new side of BtVS- a more darker, more adult grown up version of the show we love. Alot of viewers were unhappy with this new tone, but BtVS was 6 years older- it can't remain the same lighthearted, almost campy, high school show now that Buffy is all grown up.  She is no longer sheltered within the comfines of high school.  She no longer has a mother or even a watcher.  She is now responsible for bills,plumbing, mortgages.  She is surrogate mother to Dawn and has to deal with Social workers, grades, PTa etc.  and oh, she is still the slayer and protector of the world (not just high school.)&lt;BR5.  The price of the DVD is worth it just to have the full uncut version of OMWF plus all the DVD extras (music videos).  The first run of the episode was over an hour- subsequent repeats were edited, songs were shorted to fit into an hour.  This musical episode could have easily been a sweeps gimmick, but it transcends the expected and believably moves the story forward.  The episode demanded more of the cast who sang their own songs (when they could have easily lip sang to another better singer) and showcased the talents of Joss Whedom- who wrote/scripted the songs/episode.  Even behind the scenes talents were featured (marti noxon was the parking lady; the mustard guy was also a writer).***  These are just a few reasons why I think that season 6 deserves a second look.

777585,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B0000DANYD,D. Mok,"[2, 7]","Season 6 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the most daring yet:  You will lose not one but two major characters in the core franchise (to differing degrees), and the levels of violence, both physical and psychological, have risen considerably to nearly R-rated territory.  Season 5 was to me a blazing high point given the introduction of Michelle Trachtenberg as Dawn and the hilarious Clare Kramer as Glory, and Season 6 goes back to more the ups and downs that riddled Seasons 3 and 4.  Not all the episodes are equally strong, but when Season 6 hits the mark, it tears up the joint, and even when it doesn't work, you see the show taking admirable risks.One problem with this season is that its central villains are watery:  The Trio, three Star Wars-obsessed nerds who can do dark magic and make robots.  They just don't have the spark of bad-girl slayer Faith, evil Angel, or crazy, vain hell god Glory, though Adam Busch is suitably slimy as Trio leader Warren, a misogynistic tech whiz who becomes more and more detestable as time goes on.  But it's just too easy to dismiss them because they just, well, aren't fun enough to watch, and you just don't have enough sympathy towards them for them to become first-class villains.  All the classic Buffy villains were likeable (Spike and Faith being especially so), and the Trio is not.In interviews Joss Whedon said that they believe &quot;When Buffy's in pain, the show is good&quot;.  I've always felt they took this adage too far beginning with Season 3 -- Buffy's become such a brooder that she frequently borders on self-pity.  So it's no surprise that I find the comedic episodes the most enjoyable:  &quot;Life Serial&quot; has the Trio messing up Buffy's life with a series of zany tests, the best of which has Buffy stuck in a Groundhog Day-style loop inside the Magic Box store; writer Rebecca Rand Kirshner's &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; is for me the high point of the season as magic-addicted Willow messes up a spell and erases everybody's memory, leaving it a free-for-all for the characters to theorize about who's who; and &quot;Gone&quot; brings back a Buffy I've missed sorely, the impish, fun-loving gal, as she's turned invisible by a freakish Trio accident and discovers the freedom (and danger) of not being seen.The fabled musical episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; was such a hot idea that I know I had unfulfillable expectations of the episode, and it didn't turn out to be as fun as I thought -- too many of the lyrics were direct expressions of what the characters were feeling.  But there remain delights -- Dawn's &quot;ballet fight&quot; with entertainment demon Sweet is hilarious, and Xander and Anya's &quot;I'll Never Tell&quot; is enjoyable, reminds me of the recent French musical Jeanne et le Garcon Formidable.Buffy's psychological torment in this season is a hit-or-miss affair.  The concept is fascinating -- when Buffy is brought back from the dead and we suspect maybe she would rather have stayed there.  But it also often pits the character into the worst kinds of self-importance, such as when she thinks she's committed a murder and turns all high and mighty with moral indignation.  The theme has been explored a long time ago (in the episode &quot;Ted&quot;), and far better.  But Sarah Michelle Gellar seems to have rediscovered the important bubbly side of the Buffy dichotomy early in the season (or maybe the zanier episodes allowed her to show it), resulting in one of her better performances.  Alyson Hannigan hits a peak with her portrayal of Willow's magic addiction, then heartbreak and turn towards evil, and Nicholas Brendon and Emma Caulfield's work in &quot;Hell's Bells&quot; is exemplary, when Xander and Anya find their relationship fracturing -- on the day of their wedding.It's hard not to lose momentum six years into a show and Buffy the Vampire Slayer should get honorable mentions for still being able to deliver on many levels.  Many parts of this season feel laborious and the overall arc is messier than usual, but as usual, the rewards are worth it.",4,"Often slow and chaotic, but with some extreme high points.",1085961600,"05 31, 2004",2004,4081,"['Season', '6', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'was', 'most', 'daring', 'yet', 'will', 'lose', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'major', 'characters', 'core', 'franchise', 'differing', 'degrees', 'levels', 'violence', 'physical', 'psychological', 'have', 'risen', 'considerably', 'nearly', 'R-rated', 'territory', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'blazing', 'high', 'point', 'given', 'introduction', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Dawn', 'hilarious', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'Glory', 'Season', '6', 'back', 'more', 'ups', 'downs', 'riddled', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'Not', 'episodes', 'are', 'equally', 'strong', 'when', 'Season', '6', 'mark', 'joint', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'work', 'see', 'show', 'taking', 'admirable', 'risks.One', 'problem', 'season', 'central', 'villains', 'are', 'watery', 'Trio', 'three', 'Star', 'Wars-obsessed', 'nerds', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'dark', 'magic', 'make', 'robots', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'spark', 'bad-girl', 'slayer', 'Faith', 'evil', 'Angel', 'crazy', 'vain', 'hell', 'god', 'Glory', 'Adam', 'Busch', 'suitably', 'slimy', 'Trio', 'leader', 'Warren', 'misogynistic', 'tech', 'whiz', 'who', 'more', 'more', 'detestable', 'time', 'just', 'too', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'just', 'well', 'are', ""n't"", 'fun', 'enough', 'watch', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'become', 'first-class', 'villains', 'classic', 'Buffy', 'villains', 'were', 'likeable', 'Spike', 'Faith', 'being', 'especially', 'so', 'Trio', 'not.In', 'interviews', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'said', 'believe', 'quot', 'When', 'Buffy', 'pain', 'show', 'good', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'took', 'adage', 'too', 'far', 'beginning', 'Season', '3', 'Buffy', 'become', 'such', 'brooder', 'frequently', 'borders', 'self-pity', 'surprise', 'find', 'comedic', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'quot', 'Life', 'Serial', 'quot', 'Trio', 'messing', 'up', 'Buffy', 'life', 'series', 'zany', 'tests', 'best', 'Buffy', 'stuck', 'Groundhog', 'Day-style', 'loop', 'Magic', 'Box', 'store', 'Rebecca', 'Rand', 'Kirshner', 'quot', 'Tabula', 'Rasa', 'quot', 'high', 'point', 'season', 'magic-addicted', 'Willow', 'up', 'spell', 'everybody', 'memory', 'leaving', 'free-for-all', 'characters', 'theorize', 'who', 'who', 'quot', 'Gone', 'quot', 'back', 'Buffy', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'sorely', 'impish', 'fun-loving', 'gal', 'turned', 'invisible', 'freakish', 'Trio', 'accident', 'freedom', 'danger', 'not', 'being', 'seen.The', 'fabled', 'musical', 'episode', 'quot', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'quot', 'was', 'such', 'hot', 'idea', 'know', 'had', 'unfulfillable', 'expectations', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'as', 'fun', 'thought', 'too', 'many', 'lyrics', 'were', 'direct', 'expressions', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'feeling', 'there', 'remain', 'delights', 'Dawn', 'quot', 'fight', 'quot', 'entertainment', 'demon', 'Sweet', 'hilarious', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Tell', 'quot', 'enjoyable', 'recent', 'French', 'musical', 'Jeanne', 'et', 'le', 'Garcon', 'Formidable.Buffy', 'psychological', 'torment', 'season', 'hit-or-miss', 'affair', 'concept', 'fascinating', 'when', 'Buffy', 'brought', 'back', 'dead', 'suspect', 'maybe', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'stayed', 'there', 'also', 'often', 'character', 'worst', 'kinds', 'self-importance', 'such', 'when', 'committed', 'murder', 'high', 'mighty', 'moral', 'indignation', 'theme', 'been', 'explored', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'episode', 'quot', 'Ted', 'quot', 'far', 'better', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'have', 'rediscovered', 'important', 'bubbly', 'side', 'Buffy', 'dichotomy', 'early', 'season', 'maybe', 'zanier', 'allowed', 'show', 'resulting', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'peak', 'portrayal', 'Willow', 'magic', 'addiction', 'then', 'heartbreak', 'turn', 'towards', 'evil', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'work', 'quot', 'Hell', 'Bells', 'quot', 'exemplary', 'when', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'find', 'relationship', 'fracturing', 'day', 'wedding.It', 'hard', 'not', 'lose', 'momentum', 'six', 'years', 'show', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'should', 'get', 'honorable', 'mentions', 'still', 'being', 'able', 'deliver', 'many', 'levels', 'Many', 'parts', 'season', 'feel', 'laborious', 'overall', 'arc', 'messier', 'usual', 'usual', 'rewards', 'are']",N/A
777586,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B0000DANYD,DonAthos,"[10, 11]","Buffy's Sixth Season is its most misunderstood. One of the strengths of the show is that its tone and thematic elements mature and progress from one season to the next. The Sixth Season deals with some of the darker aspects of life, such as addiction, depression and suicide. Because Buffy is such an excellent show in terms of writing, direction and acting, it presents these dark elements very well. In short, the Sixth Season is a dark and fairly depressing season. It is, therefore, not very popular and especially among a fanbase that was built around some fairly light hearted, fantasy-type storylines in the first few seasons.Make no mistake. This season deals with vengeance, murder, child-neglect, self-hatred and rape, among other things. It is not for everyone. It is adult. But it is brilliant.Aside from the masterfully tragic nature of the season, it also contains one of the greatest episodes--the famous Once More With Feeling--the best villains of the series, and the greatest plot-arc in the climax of Willow's five-season long journey from geek to powerful witch. The four part finale (Seeing Red, Villains, Two to Go and Grave) is harrowing and thrilling.This season almost stands alone in terms of quality, as it does things no other season does, but I would rate it as the third best overall, behind seasons two and five.

777587,A2QOQKEG2VTX48,B0000DANYD,DONNA J. MILLER,"[3, 4]","In every series there comes a time from which the characters must move on past their childhood and high school and grow into their own people. &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer- Season Six&quot; is a perfect example of how every show changes and the characters change into adults and must deal with adult problems. Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Xander (Nicholas Brendan), Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), Anya (Emma Caufield), Tara (Amber Benson), and Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) all must  grow past their stages of the past five seasons and finally become their own people. Season six is a good season with a great cast and a great way of showing how the characters change, but some people may find this season too dark and twisted to enjoy. It is a draw of the dice to how someone will react to &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer- Season Six&quot;, but most people will find themselves enjoying it.To start, the cast of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; is still going on a great streak. It has been clear through the other five seasons that the cast is unbelievable, and they show it even more in this season which they must go through the motions. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a stunning and hearbreaking job as Buffy who was torn from heaven, where she went to after her death in Season Five. Gellar made me almost burst into tears several times, especially when we first discover that she was in heaven, and torn out by the people who love her, by her friends. Most likely, her performance will touch you unlike any other she has ever done. Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendan play her sidekicks Willow and Xander just as well, and for the first time they get to show who they really are. With a much larger part, Alyson Hannigan does a stellar job creating Willow's addiction to magic, her grief over pulling Buffy out of heaven, and her drowning relationship with Tara. Brendan makes Xander a guy who doesn't quite have it all together, and is really not sure if he and Anya are ready for marriage. He does a great job in his change of character from the funny guy to the serious guy who must pull himself together and take responsibility. Amber Benson and Emma Caufield also finally get a stand on the show, where Tara becomes her own character and Anya deals with the nervousness of marriage and an eventual hearbreak. Anya is also always great for a laugh, with her witty character. Anthony Stewart Head doesn't have as large a part but his presence is still so powerful, and James Marsters plays Spike again, who's chip and affection for Buffy are making him a little too human. Michelle Trachtenberg's Dawn gets a little more annoying in this season, but its how the writers wrote it, and Trachtenberg plays the character with great ability. The crew of &quot;Buffy&quot; is still great, and Joss Wheadon does an excellent job when writing the musical episode &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot; which was breakthrough in the series and television in itself.Next, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; finally has its characters growing up. Buffy must come back from the dead, and when she does, she has to deal with real life situations, such as house bills, taking care of Dawn, and even finally getting a job. She takes in all the jobs that her mother had, but with her mother gone, she must become the mom. Xander has to act like an adult and get ready to support Anya, who is also growing up with her full responsibility of the Majic Shop. Willow and Tara had to grow up in Buffy's absence as Dawn's guardians, and Tara especially had to take an adult decision and decide to leave Willow due to her addiction. Giles also finally saw that as much as it pained him, he needed to leave Buffy and the gang so that they wouldn't turn to him whenever trouble struck. There was also a great comparison with the gang finally growing and their enemy of the season, the Trio, doing everything but growing up. It was important for the gang to grow up and become their own people, making them seem like real people.Finally, although it is a great show, some people may find this season disturbing. It has dark content, including Willow's addiction to magic, Buffy and Spike's horribly adult relationship, Dawn's dark side, the steamy relationship between Tara and Willow, and the Trio (who are pretty much annoying and useless, very unncessary to the season). Season six has the darkest and most disturbing of all endings, with the death of a main character and a very disturbing and gory murder committed where someone literally has their skin ripped off. It is not that Season Six is a bad season, it is just a much darker season from what audience are used to with the other seasons.Overall, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer- Season Six&quot; is worth the buy for any &quot;Buffy&quot; finatic. It has a great cast and is very well acted, but it deals with some scary issues. Aside from the scary issues, there are standout episodes including &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot;, &quot;Bargaining&quot;, and &quot;Normal Again&quot;. Season Six has the same theme as the the other seasons, which is that Buffy and her friends cannot seem to find their place in the world, but it expresses it in a different style.

777589,A3W0S9MR4A959D,B0000DANYD,dramadude 186,"[3, 4]","Season 6 is kind of the dark horse among Buffy fans, and having watched the show during its initial UPN run I can understand why.  Heck, even I was turned off by the dark, relentlessly depressing nature of the season, the lack of a traditional big bad, and the network's sporadic airing of new episodes.  Thank God for DVD, because thanks to this set I have a whole new appreciation for Joss Whedon, his writers, and the highly talented actors.Without the weeks or sometimes months between new episodes (God bless UPN for keeping Buffy alive, but couldn't you have shown new episodes closer together?), the narrative structure of the season works so much better.  It is much easier to watch and appreciate the growth and change experienced by the main cast, all of who slowly grow up throughout the season until they are nothing like the group of high schoolers we first met.  The writers did a wonderful job of providing a distinct arc for each character, and the actors did a brilliant job portraying the evolution of the characters.Sarah Michelle Gellar is once again stellar as Buffy Summers, whose emotional problems this season make all the angst up until now seem like kiddy stuff.  I'm so glad Joss and company made the effort to earn Buffy's resurrection instead of simply reviving her and then letting everything immediately go back to normal.  They took the much more difficult and ultimately more rewarding path of having Buffy slowly readjusting to her life, not fully reintegrating herself into Sunnydale until the end of the season.All the other actors actors are equally fine, but Emma Caulfield deserves special recognition for her charming and underappreciated Anya.  Consistantly hilarious, Caulfield takes a character who was clearly added to the show's roster as comic relief and makes her multi-dimensional and surprisingly human.  By the end of the heart-wrenching &quot;Hell's Bells,&quot; Anya shows an emotional depth that makes her possibly the most tragic character of the season, and Miss Caulfield handles the part beautifully.And of course, season six of Buffy gave us the much lauded musical episode &quot;Once More, With Feeling.&quot;  I'm not ashamed to admit that it is my FAVORITE episode of the entire seven season run, encapsulating just about everything that makes Buffy special.  It's smart, well written, irreverant, and packed with a surprising amount of emotional resonance.  No, most of the cast won't be going to Broadway anytime soon, but bravo to the entire cast for handling their own singing, which actually only serves to make the episode more charming.Season six of Buffy brought the characters to new low points in their lives, the show to new heights as far as writing and storytelling go, and produced some of the most entertaining adversaries the show's every seen (maybe I'm a nerd, but I find the Trio to be absolutely hysterical).  If you've been watching the show since day one, now certainly isn't the time to stop, and if you've never seen the show, you're missing out on one of the most consistantly excellent programs of the last decade.",4,"Not the Buffy We Fell in Love With, but Still Damn Good TV",1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,3101,"['Season', '6', 'kind', 'dark', 'horse', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'having', 'watched', 'show', 'initial', 'UPN', 'run', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Heck', 'even', 'was', 'turned', 'off', 'dark', 'relentlessly', 'depressing', 'nature', 'season', 'lack', 'traditional', 'big', 'bad', 'network', 'sporadic', 'airing', 'new', 'episodes', 'Thank', 'God', 'DVD', 'thanks', 'set', 'have', 'whole', 'new', 'appreciation', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'writers', 'highly', 'talented', 'weeks', 'sometimes', 'months', 'new', 'episodes', 'God', 'bless', 'UPN', 'keeping', 'Buffy', 'alive', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'shown', 'new', 'episodes', 'closer', 'together', 'narrative', 'structure', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'much', 'easier', 'watch', 'appreciate', 'growth', 'change', 'experienced', 'main', 'cast', 'who', 'slowly', 'grow', 'up', 'season', 'are', 'nothing', 'group', 'high', 'schoolers', 'first', 'met', 'writers', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'providing', 'distinct', 'arc', 'character', 'actors', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'portraying', 'evolution', 'characters.Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'once', 'again', 'stellar', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'emotional', 'problems', 'season', 'make', 'angst', 'up', 'now', 'seem', 'kiddy', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'Joss', 'company', 'made', 'effort', 'earn', 'Buffy', 'resurrection', 'instead', 'simply', 'reviving', 'then', 'letting', 'everything', 'immediately', 'go', 'back', 'normal', 'took', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'ultimately', 'more', 'rewarding', 'path', 'having', 'Buffy', 'slowly', 'readjusting', 'life', 'not', 'fully', 'reintegrating', 'Sunnydale', 'end', 'season.All', 'other', 'actors', 'actors', 'are', 'equally', 'fine', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'special', 'recognition', 'charming', 'underappreciated', 'Anya', 'Consistantly', 'hilarious', 'Caulfield', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'clearly', 'added', 'show', 'roster', 'comic', 'relief', 'multi-dimensional', 'surprisingly', 'human', 'end', 'heart-wrenching', 'quot', 'Hell', 'Bells', 'quot', 'Anya', 'emotional', 'depth', 'possibly', 'most', 'tragic', 'character', 'season', 'Miss', 'Caulfield', 'part', 'beautifully.And', 'course', 'season', 'six', 'Buffy', 'gave', 'much', 'lauded', 'musical', 'episode', 'quot', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling.', 'quot', ""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'FAVORITE', 'episode', 'entire', 'seven', 'season', 'run', 'encapsulating', 'just', 'everything', 'Buffy', 'special', 'smart', 'well', 'written', 'irreverant', 'packed', 'surprising', 'amount', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'No', 'most', 'cast', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'going', 'Broadway', 'anytime', 'soon', 'entire', 'cast', 'handling', 'own', 'singing', 'actually', 'only', 'make', 'episode', 'more', 'charming.Season', 'six', 'Buffy', 'brought', 'characters', 'new', 'low', 'points', 'lives', 'show', 'new', 'heights', 'as', 'far', 'writing', 'storytelling', 'go', 'produced', 'most', 'entertaining', 'adversaries', 'show', 'seen', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'nerd', 'find', 'Trio', 'be', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'day', 'one', 'now', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'time', 'stop', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', ""'re"", 'missing', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'consistantly', 'excellent', 'programs', 'last', 'decade']",N/A
777590,A1RQQCPDN7ZCHU,B0000DANYD,"E.A. Week ""reviewer-at-large""","[13, 34]","With the move of ""Buffy"" to UPN and the shifting of executive-producer responsibility from Joss Whedon to Marti Noxon, the final nail was driven into the Slayer's coffin--literally and metaphorically.  The fourth and fifth seasons had shown a depressing decline in overall quality, but by season six, the show's writing staff not only hit the bottom of the barrel, they scraped right through it and started digging for China.The year began with an interesting concept: Buffy, killed in the season five finale, gets dragged out of heaven and restored to life by her well-meaning but ultimately clueless friends.  To console herself, she enters into a degrading and abusive sado-masochistic affair with vampire Spike.  There was nothing 'daring' or funny or remotely entertaining about this arc: it was all about a monster with no soul callously taking advantage of a young woman's extreme emotional vulnerability to gratify his base desires.  The nadir of the arc occurs when she finally breaks off with him and he tries to rape her.  For a show known for its witty feminism in its first 3 seasons, this is nothing short of vile.  Parents, *don't* let your kids, especially young girls, watch this dreck.  It sends so many bad messages about sex and male-female relationships that it's mind-boggling.Elsewhere, the main villains of the season are three incredibly annoying high school dropout nerds who live in a basement and argue about arcane trivia from movies, comics, etc.  (Yes, let's bite the hand that feeds us!)  The show's writers may have found this funny, but they were about as amusing as a case of poison ivy.  Hard to believe this mindless drivel was created by the same folks who came up with the first three seasons' big bads: the Master, Angelus, and the Mayor.Don't let anyone kid you that Tara's death was some kind of big tragedy.  She was a two-bit boring wet dishcloth whose sole purpose on the series (for two entire seasons!) was to remind viewers that Willow was ""gay now!"" (as if) and provide some occasional girl-on-girl titillation (for those turned on by pudding-faced dirty blondes who can't act; hey, there's no accounting for taste).  As her presence was negligible at best, her absence scarcely made an impact the following season.  And ""Evil Willow?""  Oh, puh-leeze.  Just a tired and obvious re-tread of the far superior Buffy vs. Faith in season three, only with much more outlandish fighting and hokey special effects.  Marti Noxon earned her own special place in hell for the insipid ""magic addiction"" plot.Xander and Anya, another complete waste of space: their thoroughly irritating ""relationship"" ended predictably with non-marriage.  Anya gets her demonic mojo back, then does precisely nothing with it.  Oh, and let's not forget whiny annoying younger sibling Dawn, who spends most of the season holding up the walls because, let's face it, when Glory died, Dawn's whole purpose on the show died with it.  Alas, someone forgot to tell the writers.  [This also applied to pretty much 90% of the cast, who were kept around long after their expiration dates passed, so that by the series finale a year later, the cast had swollen to the size of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.]Literally the only worthwhile episode in the entire sixth season is ""Once More With Feeling,"" a musical that was far, far better than it had any right to be, especially coming so late in the series' decline.  Anthony Stewart Head, in particular, has fantastic pipes, and he literally carries the episode from start to finish.  The other cast members may not have the greatest voices, but they sing with gusto and courage.  The song-and-dance numbers simultaneously parody and play homage to a variety of sources (from hard rock to classical Broadway musicals), while also delving into the characters' unspoken fears.  Even the untalented Emma Caufield and Amber Benson prove surprisingly gifted songbirds, and the insipid plotlines--defying all logic--take on unexpected poignancy and meaning when set to music.Bottom line: save your money.  Catch the musical in syndicated reruns, and invest in the DVD sets of first three seasons.

Some of the actors' have real musical talent, but that's not what I want to see in a show about slaying vampires and other baddies.That said, I enjoyed the season immensely. I would've preferred a more serious central villain(s), but I was glad they got off the notion that each subsequent Big Bad had to be Bigger and Badder than last season's; when the hero has to take an inexplicable swan dive sacrifice to end the evil, the evil's gone too freaking far. That's not a dramatic resolution; it's a writer's cop-out. In fact, I would've loved season six if for no other reason than to make sure the show doesn't end on that lameness. Further, I liked the strange love affair with Spike, as well as the changes in Spike's character (nothing violates ""canon"" when dealing with character developement, otherwise all characters would be totally static). Willow's grief about Tara was especially moving. And, I appreciated the conflict of Buffy's return from the after-life, not from hell but from heaven; I only thought they didn't explore the idea but just let it dribble off into a general Buffy-funk.The season was darker, even grim at points, and the story became more about the characters than about the endless battle against Evil. It's more sexual (and more misandrous). It's more intense in it's conflicts (after all, what's more conflicted than having to fight Willow?). It was at least as good as season five; almost at the level of season three.

Seeing these people fight in verse was hilarious!""Tabula Rasa"" was a very entertaining! Seeing the gang loose all their memories and acting different towards one another was amusing. Especially between Giles and Spike thinking they were father and son (though they certainly could've passed for it)! Also, seeing a straight Willow for one episode was nice as she thought her and Xander were a couple (which I always thought they should've been).Other angles was the break up and reunion of Tara and Willow, which results in her death and subsequent rampage by Willow. Xander leaving Anya at the alter, Dawn feeling neglected and becoming a clepto as a result and Buffy's sudden sex craze with Spike! By the way, this season also produces one of the most disturbing scenes as Spike attempts to rape Buffy after Buffy soon after ends their sexual relationship. While this was used as motivation for Spike to make a change with himself, I am not so sure this type of scene was needed to accomplish that.By the way, is it just me or should Dawn had died in Season 5?

777599,A3JUMMIGJ7B38X,B0000DANYD,GarionOrb,"[4, 6]","Thus is the theme for Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Sixth Season.  The show picks up where the last season ended....Buffy being dead buried with a robot version taking her place while her friends are picking up the pieces.  However, once they bring back the real Buffy, don't expect the show to continue as it has in previous seasons.  This season is dark, depressing and at times it's flat-out gut-wrenching.  Not one single character is ever happy, as each one spirals down into the depths of despair.  The main villains in this aren't vampires, secret government institutions, or invincible goddesses...it's three average-joe nerds who use technological toys to try to take over Sunnydale.  This leads to a couple of humerous episodes, but nothing grand.Buffy is dealing with being brought back to life after being in Heaven and begins a tumultuous relationship with Spike (whose ultimate fate at the end must've had viewers green with anticipation of season 7!).  Willow and Tara's relationship gets rocky as Willow becomes uncontrollably addicted to magic.  Xander and Anya prepare to get married while secretly harboring the typical pre-marriage second thoughts.  Dawn is reduced to the typical teenage brattiness and lust for attention.  And Giles...well, there's not much of him this season.  He's a ""special guest star"" on the episodes he's in.Does this make for a great season?  Of course it does, only in a different way.  Since the drama between the characters is so paramount, there are only 1 or 2 filler episodes, and all the relevant episodes aren't very flashy or elaborate.  However you get so enveloped in the characters' lives, the slowness of the season is completely irrelevant.  All this leads up to a grand ending however (beginning in episode 19) where the show's writers found a creative and chilling way to bring about this season's apocalypse.One more point that must be brought up is the brilliant seventh episode, ""Once More With Feeling"".  If you're a Buffy fan, this musical episode is worth the price of the entire box set.  The songs are well-written and provide an incredible dramatic effect as the episode moves along.  In addition, the music accentuates the characters' dilemmas in a way that a normal episode never could.  This is the episode that got me to watch Buffy from the beginning!Season Six is truly unique in the Buffyverse.  Beware of the extremely sudden and unexpected death of a major character!

The switch in networks saw the lifting of many content restrictions on the show, which were made most noticeable by the increased displays of affection between Willow &amp; Tara, as well as some of the truly disturbing moments between Buffy and Spike. Also causing problems were the Buffy/Spike relationship in general (which became the primary focus of Buffy's life), the absence of Giles, Willow's magic &quot;addiction&quot;, and the death of Tara (which had serious ramifications for Season 7, to say nothing of how it caused an ungodly number of flame wars on the Internet).Despite the sometimes flawed presentation of the above plot elements, Season 6 was very good, particularly from &quot;Hell's Bells&quot; forward and &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot;, the highly-acclaimed musical episode. The extras here are some of the best of the entire series, with an hour-long documentary (produced, if I remember right, for A&amp;E's Biography) and a great panel discussion conducted not long after the Season 6 finale aired, along with the usual lot of audio commentaries on some of the episodes.You might not have liked this season (and, with the possible exception of Season 7, this is the most widely disliked season of the series), but there's no doubt that it was a compelling run nonetheless.

Whether you are a fan of musicals or not, this episode was wonderfully executed, and easily stands out as one of the highlight episodes of the entire series.  There are a few more gems in season six, including &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;, &quot;Selfless&quot;, and &quot;Grave&quot;, which also make this set worth owning.  On the downside, the typically easy mixture of humor, action, and angst which this series normally achieves is somewhat absent throughout a large portion of season six, most likely due to the lessened involvement of creator Joss Whedon.  Season Six also suffers from the absence of Anthony Stewart Head and his Rupert Giles character.  I've long felt that the Giles character was one of the grounding elements which helped glue the &quot;Scoobies&quot; together, and things unravel within the group quickly upon his departure.  Finally, I thought that the handling of the Willow character's descent in to the darkest reaches of black magic was done in a completely ham-handed and over-the-top manner.  I found it very hard to reconcile the black-eyed destroyer of the universe persona with the sweet and gentle Willow persona who was established in the previous 5 seasons.

777607,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B0000DANYD,Hazen B Markoe,"[8, 9]","When the TV show, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, hit its 6th season, the cult hit had come to a crossroads of sorts.  For one thing, the show had left its longtime home on the WB for UPN as a result of contract negotiations.  Secondly, the title character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar had been killed off at the end of the last season, leaving quite a cliffhanger to solve.  There was also a complication in that longtime cast member Anthony Stewart Head (Buffy's mentor, Giles) had asked for a smaller role, so he could spend more time with his family in England.  Finally, UPN had given creator Joss Whedon more creative freedom to ""push the envelope.""  As a result, the show had perhaps one of its more interesting, yet controversial seasons yet.  Indeed, many fans (and cast members) found themselves doubting this ""darker"" new direction.When Buffy is brought back from the dead by Willow (Alyson Hannigan), at first everyone is convinced that she was saved from a fate worse than death.  However, it turns out that Buffy was pulled from eternal bliss, leaving her both disconnected and uncaring about her life around her.  Looking to feel anything, she indulges in a lustful affair with former foe Spike (James Marsters).  Among the many things that complicate matters are Willow's growing addiction to magic and the attempts of a trio of geeky would-be villains to take over Sunnydale.As always, Sarah Michelle Gellar leads the way, and she convincingly handles Buffy's profound lack of direction and desire.  James Marsters continues to shine as bad-boy vamp Spike.  Anthony Stewart Head is again solid as Giles, and his character is sorely missed through much of the season.  Amber Benson provides wonderful support as Willow's fellow witch and love, Tara.  However, it is Alyson Hannigan as the tortured Willow who really gets to test her acting chops.  To simply say that she succeeds is an understatement.Despite the overall unevenness of the season, there is the usual supply of stellar episodes.  For starters is the hilarious ""Tabula Rasa,"" in which the gang lose their memories and create wacky new identities of their own.  The ""Dark Willow"" episodes bring the season to a tremendous and darkly chilling climax.  Finally, one cannot discuss this season without mentioning the best episode of the bunch; the wonderful and delightfully silly musical episode ""Once More With Feeling!""  Whedon gets to perform a delightful spin on his show using the musical genre format.  Benson, Head and Marsters are the most adept at handling the medium, but everyone has their fun moments.The DVD set has the usual special features including select episode commentaries, episode scripts, outtakes, and the usual featurettes about the season.  Of special interest, however, are a live panel discussion of the show featuring some of the cast and crew and an A&amp;E television ""Biography"" about the show and its impact on today's culture.As always, BUFFY never ceases to entertain and push the boundaries of the television medium.  If you're a solid fan of the show, I would definitely recommend this.  More casual fans would do well to pick another more upbeat season of the show to enjoy.",4,"Buffy 6 is a solid, if mixed, witch's brew",1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,3186,"['When', 'TV', 'show', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'hit', '6th', 'season', 'cult', 'hit', 'had', 'come', 'crossroads', 'sorts', 'one', 'thing', 'show', 'had', 'left', 'longtime', 'home', 'WB', 'UPN', 'result', 'contract', 'negotiations', 'Secondly', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'off', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'leaving', 'quite', 'cliffhanger', 'solve', 'was', 'also', 'complication', 'longtime', 'cast', 'member', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'Buffy', 'mentor', 'Giles', 'had', 'asked', 'smaller', 'role', 'could', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'family', 'England', 'Finally', 'UPN', 'had', 'given', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'more', 'creative', 'freedom', 'push', 'envelope', 'result', 'show', 'had', 'perhaps', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'yet', 'controversial', 'seasons', 'yet', 'Indeed', 'many', 'fans', 'cast', 'members', 'found', 'doubting', 'darker', 'new', 'direction.When', 'Buffy', 'brought', 'back', 'dead', 'Willow', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'first', 'everyone', 'convinced', 'was', 'saved', 'fate', 'worse', 'death', 'However', 'out', 'Buffy', 'was', 'pulled', 'eternal', 'bliss', 'leaving', 'disconnected', 'uncaring', 'life', 'Looking', 'feel', 'anything', 'lustful', 'affair', 'former', 'foe', 'Spike', 'James', 'Marsters', 'many', 'things', 'complicate', 'matters', 'are', 'Willow', 'growing', 'addiction', 'magic', 'attempts', 'trio', 'geeky', 'would-be', 'villains', 'take', 'over', 'Sunnydale.As', 'always', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'way', 'convincingly', 'Buffy', 'profound', 'lack', 'direction', 'desire', 'James', 'Marsters', 'shine', 'bad-boy', 'vamp', 'Spike', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'again', 'solid', 'Giles', 'character', 'sorely', 'missed', 'much', 'season', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'wonderful', 'support', 'Willow', 'fellow', 'witch', 'love', 'Tara', 'However', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'tortured', 'Willow', 'who', 'really', 'test', 'acting', 'chops', 'simply', 'say', 'understatement.Despite', 'overall', 'unevenness', 'season', 'usual', 'supply', 'stellar', 'episodes', 'starters', 'hilarious', 'Tabula', 'Rasa', 'gang', 'lose', 'memories', 'create', 'wacky', 'new', 'identities', 'own', 'Dark', 'Willow', 'bring', 'season', 'tremendous', 'darkly', 'chilling', 'climax', 'Finally', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'discuss', 'season', 'mentioning', 'best', 'episode', 'bunch', 'wonderful', 'delightfully', 'silly', 'musical', 'episode', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'Whedon', 'perform', 'delightful', 'spin', 'show', 'using', 'musical', 'genre', 'format', 'Benson', 'Head', 'Marsters', 'are', 'most', 'adept', 'handling', 'medium', 'everyone', 'fun', 'moments.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'usual', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'select', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'episode', 'scripts', 'outtakes', 'usual', 'featurettes', 'season', 'special', 'interest', 'however', 'are', 'live', 'panel', 'discussion', 'show', 'featuring', 'cast', 'crew', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'television', 'Biography', 'show', 'impact', 'today', 'culture.As', 'always', 'BUFFY', 'never', 'entertain', 'push', 'boundaries', 'television', 'medium', ""'re"", 'solid', 'fan', 'show', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'More', 'casual', 'fans', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'pick', 'more', 'upbeat', 'season', 'show', 'enjoy']",N/A
777608,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0000DANYD,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Okay, I've got some time to kill, so here's a looong breakdown of Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season Six. In the course of a week, I managed to watch the entire dvd, episodes and extra features. And whew! Thankfully, this season's quality maintains the excellence I remember from the original TV airings. Yes, this is the series's darkest season so far and yes, some episodes are really grim and depressing. Joss Whedon pulls no punches as he has his kids grow up and face grown-up issues and consequences while still battling the creatures of the Big Bad.The season's progressively bleak episodes begin with Buffy Summers being brought back from the dead (again) but feeling that she has come back all wrong (she believes she was in Heaven and was torn from it by her friends). Then follows her self-destructive relationship with Spike; the heartbreaking dissolution of Xander and Anya as a couple; Willow's addiction to magic, as well as Willow and Tara's down-spiraling relationship; and culminates in the death of a Scooby, Willow's eventual embrace of the dark side and the advent of Dark Willow. Even the initially goofy trio of dorks who becomes the Slayer's nemesis(sisis) become something very serious and tragic by season's end.It was an overtly sexual season, as Buffy and Spike get it on in several episodes, most notably in ""Wrecked"", ""Doublemeat Palace"" and particularly in the semi-graphic climax of ""Smashed"". However, these scenes are key to properly conveying Buffy's tormented, crumbling emotional and psychological state, as she desperately turns to Spike in an attempt to once more feel alive. Not to forget, Willow and Tara also have several naughty scenes, but theirs are more rated PG-13.Series creator Joss Whedon continues to deliver wonderful multi-layered storytelling, laying in texture and depth to his characters, and lush detail and substance to his plotting. His trademark wit and humor are still very much in evidence, now ably serving as counterpoints to this year's themes of desolation, adulthood and crumbling relationships. Whedon's genius is that he knows how to seamlessly blend the commonplace with fantasy, thus grounding his story in day to day realism. Just as he had Buffy's mother unexpectedly passing away by normal means, the mundane fashion in which a key character dies in ""Seeing Red"" hits home harder and makes it all the more heartwrenching. Whedon serves his characters very well by incorporating sequences which showcase the actors' across-the-board impressive acting talents. Everyone has a chance to shine and have his or her personal arc develop. Xander, one of my favorite characters, actually steps up and gets a to save the world in one episode. Standouts this season are the very accomplished Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alyson Hannigan. There are plenty of highlight episodes here: the instant musical classic ""Once More, with Feeling"", the very funny ""Tabula Rasa"", ""Doublemeat Palace"", ""Hell's Bells"", the poignant ""Entropy"", ""Two to Go"", and the kick-ass season-finale ""Grave"", just to name several.The gratifyingly dense special features include various episode commentaries by directors and writers of the show (including a Joss Whedon commentary on ""Once More, with Feeling""); a ""Once More, with Feeling"" behind the scenes segment; a Buffy karaoke; a very fun and lively ""Behind the Scenes of Buffy theVampire Slayer"" panel discussion with Joss Whedon, James Marsters, Nicholas Brendon, Alison Hannigan, and Michelle Trachtenberg (you get to see Whedon explain why ""Doublemeat Palace"" is the season's most controversial episode - and no, it's not 'cause of the sex); a 5-minute ""Buffy Goes to Work"" segment with cast and crew talking about the menial jobs they've had in the past; a half-hour long ""Life is the Big Bad: Season 6 Overview"" feature; a DVD-Rom Buffy Demon Guide; an outtakes segment (with mostly Brendon incessantly flubbing his lines); and a pretty interesting ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Television With a Bite"" documentary.",5,"Dark, bleak, and depressing - but still my favorite season",1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,4005,"['Okay', ""'ve"", 'got', 'time', 'kill', 'here', 'looong', 'breakdown', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Season', 'Six', 'course', 'week', 'managed', 'watch', 'entire', 'dvd', 'episodes', 'extra', 'features', 'whew', 'Thankfully', 'season', 'quality', 'excellence', 'remember', 'original', 'TV', 'airings', 'Yes', 'series', 'darkest', 'season', 'so', 'far', 'yes', 'episodes', 'are', 'really', 'grim', 'depressing', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'punches', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'face', 'grown-up', 'issues', 'consequences', 'still', 'battling', 'creatures', 'Big', 'Bad.The', 'season', 'progressively', 'bleak', 'episodes', 'begin', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'dead', 'again', 'feeling', 'come', 'back', 'wrong', 'was', 'Heaven', 'was', 'torn', 'friends', 'Then', 'self-destructive', 'relationship', 'Spike', 'heartbreaking', 'dissolution', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'couple', 'Willow', 'addiction', 'magic', 'as', 'well', 'Willow', 'Tara', 'down-spiraling', 'relationship', 'culminates', 'death', 'Scooby', 'Willow', 'eventual', 'embrace', 'dark', 'side', 'advent', 'Dark', 'Willow', 'Even', 'initially', 'goofy', 'trio', 'dorks', 'who', 'Slayer', 'nemesis', 'sisis', 'become', 'something', 'very', 'serious', 'tragic', 'season', 'end.It', 'was', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'get', 'several', 'episodes', 'most', 'notably', 'Wrecked', 'Doublemeat', 'Palace', 'particularly', 'semi-graphic', 'climax', 'Smashed', 'However', 'scenes', 'are', 'key', 'properly', 'conveying', 'Buffy', 'tormented', 'crumbling', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'state', 'desperately', 'Spike', 'attempt', 'once', 'more', 'feel', 'alive', 'Not', 'forget', 'Willow', 'Tara', 'also', 'have', 'several', 'naughty', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'rated', 'PG-13.Series', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'deliver', 'wonderful', 'multi-layered', 'storytelling', 'laying', 'texture', 'depth', 'characters', 'lush', 'detail', 'substance', 'plotting', 'trademark', 'wit', 'humor', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'evidence', 'now', 'ably', 'serving', 'counterpoints', 'year', 'themes', 'desolation', 'adulthood', 'crumbling', 'relationships', 'Whedon', 'genius', 'how', 'seamlessly', 'blend', 'commonplace', 'fantasy', 'thus', 'grounding', 'story', 'day', 'day', 'realism', 'Just', 'had', 'Buffy', 'mother', 'unexpectedly', 'passing', 'away', 'normal', 'means', 'mundane', 'fashion', 'key', 'character', 'Seeing', 'Red', 'home', 'harder', 'more', 'heartwrenching', 'Whedon', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'incorporating', 'sequences', 'showcase', 'actors', 'across-the-board', 'impressive', 'acting', 'talents', 'Everyone', 'chance', 'shine', 'have', 'personal', 'arc', 'develop', 'Xander', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'actually', 'up', 'save', 'world', 'one', 'episode', 'Standouts', 'season', 'are', 'very', 'accomplished', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'are', 'plenty', 'highlight', 'episodes', 'here', 'instant', 'musical', 'classic', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'very', 'funny', 'Tabula', 'Rasa', 'Doublemeat', 'Palace', 'Hell', 'Bells', 'poignant', 'Entropy', 'Two', 'Go', 'kick-ass', 'season-finale', 'Grave', 'just', 'name', 'several.The', 'gratifyingly', 'dense', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'various', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'directors', 'writers', 'show', 'including', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'commentary', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'scenes', 'segment', 'Buffy', 'karaoke', 'very', 'fun', 'lively', 'Scenes', 'Buffy', 'theVampire', 'Slayer', 'panel', 'discussion', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'Alison', 'Hannigan', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'get', 'see', 'Whedon', 'explain', 'why', 'Doublemeat', 'Palace', 'season', 'most', 'controversial', 'episode', 'not', ""'cause"", 'sex', '5-minute', 'Buffy', 'Goes', 'Work', 'segment', 'cast', 'crew', 'talking', 'menial', 'jobs', ""'ve"", 'had', 'past', 'half-hour', 'long', 'Life', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Season', '6', 'Overview', 'feature', 'DVD-Rom', 'Buffy', 'Demon', 'Guide', 'outtakes', 'segment', 'mostly', 'Brendon', 'incessantly', 'flubbing', 'lines', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Television', 'Bite', 'documentary']",N/A
777609,ARI1LNCQQUM74,B0000DANYD,Heather M. Dumdei,"[7, 12]","Buffy Summers died saving the world at the end of the fifth season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, so the sixth season had a lot on its hands when it started up the next fall.Season 6 spends much of its time delving into the darker sides of the characters. Buffy has to deal with being alive and suddenly having the responsibilities of family caretaker. Willow finds out just how addiction can ruin a life. Xander and Anya realize that they're not as ready to be grown up as they thought they were. Spike lets his worser half get the better of his love for Buffy. Dawn explores her bad girl side by shoplifting and sneaking out ever more.In some ways, this darkness gets a little too big for the show. It's the dark sides of the characters themselves that turn out to be the Season 6 ""Big Bad"", not the Geek Trio of Andrew, Warren and Jonathan. (The geeks are amusing if you enjoy seeing geeks extensivey mocked, however, they do start to grate as the season progresses.) The season follows the depression of the characters. At the beginning, before things start to fall apart, it's interesting to watch. Almost every one of the first 8 or 9 episodes of the season are at least good, peaking with the amazingly underappreciated (at least by the Emmy powers that be) musical episode, ""Once More, With Feeling"". The problem is that after that, the season plunges into the steaming pile of dung that makes up the middle of Season 6. (This contains two of my least favorite episodes EVER, ""Doublemeat Palace"" and ""Normal Again"". ""Hell's Bells"", however, is a worthy exception to the rest of the mid-season rubbish.) Things pick back up with ""Entropy"", and the season manages to redeem itself through an amazing, if heartbreaking, turn of events in the end (which I'm trying hard not to spoil with this review).However difficult the middle of the season is to watch, this DVD set will be worth it for ""Once More, With Feeling"" alone. It's Joss Whedon's (BUFFY creator and ruling lord) masterpiece. With little to no music writing experience, he manages to write a 50 minute musical that plays to the strengths of his non-musical cast. The cast, ever the troopers, sing and dance their way through with enthusiasm and finesse. It's often clear that they are not singers or dancers by trade, but they are all so charming (especially Emma Caulfield as Anya) that it's easy to forgive them their occasional off-key notes and missteps. And then there's Hinton Battle, the demon villain of the episode. He dances. He sings. He's probably the most charismatic thing to hit Sunnydale since Spike crashed into town in Season 2. It's a shame that he only got to have the one episode, but what an episode to have!There are other gems in the season. Check out ""Tabula Rasa"" and ""Life Serial"" for some of BUFFY's funnier moments. It's a shame that the middle of the season is so hard to stomach, but I think that it all pays off in the end.",4,A Mixed Bag (but still wonderful in my eyes),1064361600,"09 24, 2003",2003,2919,"['Buffy', 'Summers', 'died', 'saving', 'world', 'end', 'fifth', 'season', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'sixth', 'season', 'had', 'lot', 'hands', 'when', 'started', 'up', 'next', 'fall.Season', '6', 'spends', 'much', 'time', 'delving', 'darker', 'sides', 'characters', 'Buffy', 'deal', 'being', 'alive', 'suddenly', 'having', 'responsibilities', 'family', 'caretaker', 'Willow', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'addiction', 'can', 'ruin', 'life', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'realize', ""'re"", 'not', 'ready', 'be', 'grown', 'up', 'thought', 'were', 'Spike', 'worser', 'half', 'get', 'better', 'love', 'Buffy', 'Dawn', 'bad', 'girl', 'side', 'shoplifting', 'sneaking', 'out', 'ever', 'more.In', 'ways', 'darkness', 'little', 'too', 'big', 'show', 'dark', 'sides', 'characters', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Season', '6', 'Big', 'Bad', 'not', 'Geek', 'Trio', 'Andrew', 'Warren', 'Jonathan', 'geeks', 'are', 'amusing', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'geeks', 'extensivey', 'mocked', 'however', 'do', 'start', 'grate', 'season', 'season', 'depression', 'characters', 'beginning', 'things', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'interesting', 'watch', 'one', 'first', '8', '9', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'least', 'good', 'peaking', 'amazingly', 'underappreciated', 'least', 'Emmy', 'powers', 'be', 'musical', 'episode', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'problem', 'season', 'steaming', 'pile', 'dung', 'up', 'middle', 'Season', '6', 'two', 'least', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'EVER', 'Doublemeat', 'Palace', 'Normal', 'Again', 'Hell', 'Bells', 'however', 'worthy', 'exception', 'rest', 'mid-season', 'rubbish', 'Things', 'pick', 'back', 'Entropy', 'season', 'redeem', 'amazing', 'heartbreaking', 'turn', 'events', 'end', ""'m"", 'trying', 'hard', 'not', 'spoil', 'review', 'difficult', 'middle', 'season', 'watch', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'alone', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'BUFFY', 'creator', 'ruling', 'lord', 'masterpiece', 'little', 'music', 'writing', 'experience', 'write', '50', 'minute', 'musical', 'strengths', 'non-musical', 'cast', 'cast', 'ever', 'troopers', 'sing', 'dance', 'way', 'enthusiasm', 'finesse', 'often', 'clear', 'are', 'not', 'singers', 'dancers', 'trade', 'are', 'so', 'charming', 'especially', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'Anya', 'easy', 'forgive', 'occasional', 'off-key', 'notes', 'missteps', 'then', 'Hinton', 'Battle', 'demon', 'villain', 'episode', 'probably', 'most', 'charismatic', 'thing', 'hit', 'Sunnydale', 'Spike', 'crashed', 'town', 'Season', '2', 'shame', 'only', 'got', 'have', 'one', 'episode', 'what', 'episode', 'have', 'are', 'other', 'gems', 'season', 'Check', 'Tabula', 'Rasa', 'Life', 'Serial', 'BUFFY', 'funnier', 'moments', 'shame', 'middle', 'season', 'so', 'hard', 'stomach', 'think', 'off', 'end']",N/A

777613,A2TOX3E4WZ8BSQ,B0000DANYD,"Ivan K. Samuelson ""Bolski""","[8, 10]","This was not the worst season. I'm not even sure if I could begin to find one that was the worst. Each season of Buffy hits on different topics, with each season getting into more and more serious subjects. Season 6, which I didn't like the first time through, makes perfect sense now that I'm watching it again. At first, I didn't like how dark it got, especially with Buffy's fling with Spike. It seemed like the sex was just thrown into our faces and that's what turned me off to it. It was a side of Buffy many of us had never seen before and didn't like. We all looked at Buffy as something pure. Well, she's human and humans make mistakes and that's what part of the underlying theme for this season was trying to tell us, amongst other things.In Season 5, Buffy begins to learn that even college is tough. Harder due to the fact that Willow and Oz are taking accelerated courses that Buffy has a hard time dealing with. This, in many respects, show's how college begins to seperate friends, especially when they go to different schools and follow different courses of study. Then, Buffy has to deal with a sister and then her Mom dying.Season 6 brings in to play the idea of friends growing further apart as their lives begin to take form outside of the friendship circle. Plus, parents are no longer around to help them out with problems. Hence, Giles decides that for Buffy's sake, it's best that he leave and allow Buffy to handle the situations on her own. Otherwise, she will always depend on someone else doing the ""dirty work"" outside of slaying. In many respects, her slaying is the easy part. But, when it comes to handling finances, keeping a house clean, paying the bills, raising a kid sister, etc., Buffy finds that all the little things she took for granted that her mother did are a lot harder to deal with. Then, with Giles leaving, Buffy turns to Spike. With the added responsibility of taking care of everyone at home and being pulled out of ""heaven"", Buffy is at a point in her life where she's going to do what makes her feel good, no matter how ""bad"" or ""inappropriate"" it might be. She even realises this later on when she tells Spike that she's using him, even though Spike has feelings for Buffy and he sees the relationship in a different light.Willow, with no parental guidance, is becoming more and more dependant on magic (ala drugs). She starts out not even noticing it until Giles and Tara tell her. And, like a typical addict, she denies it, even to the point of threatening them that she is powerful and they best not tick her off. In the end, her addiction affects everyone around her, which includes a serious injury to Dawn and losing Tara.Xander is coming to grips with an upcoming marriage and how it's forever and wants to make sure it's the right thing to do. But, he's also realising he has a steady income and has his own apartment. These are things he didn't have before when he lived with his parents and now that he's living on his own, he's kind of enjoying it and now he's not sure if he wants to settle down.Dawn is at that stage where she feels noone is paying attention to her due to them being wrapped up in their own issues. Xander and Anya are wrapped up in wedding plans and the issues that come along with it; Tara and Willow have a relationship along with the magic addiction; Giles has left and still treats Dawn like she's 10 and all she wants is to be treated like she's 15; Buffy of course is dealing with her own problems, especially being pulled out of ""heaven"" and not wanting to take the responsibilities of raising a kid sister; so Dawn resorts to stealing and being a rebel outside of school and home.Many people thought this season was too dark and they wanted Josh to go back to the ""innocence"" that was in the first season or two. Unfortunately, life is not about innocence and life doesn't get easier as you get older. As you get older, more responsibilities come with it along with tougher choices that adults must make. Mommy and Daddy are no longer responsible for you and the Scoobies are learning this the hard way. Hence, Buffy's ""fall from grace"" with Spike; Dawn's klepto phase; Xander and Anya's wedding fiasco; Willow's addiction to magic and how she'll do anything to keep it.And through it all, Giles sees this and makes the hardest decision he has ever had to make: leave Sunnydale and the Scoobies behind to deal with their problems on their own. But, like a parent, he is available when he is really needed, and in the end, he comes through. He isn't the primary reason that the world is saved. Rather, indirectly through his leaving Sunnydale, the Scoobies begin to learn how to deal with situations that come up by themselves, rather than turning to Giles for help and making him take care of the situation.Each season to me seems to get better and better. Seasons 4 and 5 were two of the seasons I didn't quite like as much as 1, 2 and 3. But, after getting the DVDs for them and watching those seasons again, I must say they are much better than I first realised. And this is the same for season 6.This season is worth it. Not just for the musical episode, but to see how the Scoobies are growing up and learning that life out of high school is not as great as they probably thought. It's a rude awakening into reality and this season is all about that and the consequences that occur when young adults make poor choices. In the end, it isn't a big fight with a supernatural demon that ends the season. Instead, it's a fight with inner demons and how friendships are more powerful than many might think, including something as insignificant as a yellow crayon (watch this season if that doesn't make sense). Just like the end of season 2, the end of this season is a tear-jerker, but in a much different way.Of course, seeing Willow as the Big Bad is awesome too!",5,NOT the worst season - possibly one of the better ones!,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,5858,"['was', 'not', 'worst', 'season', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'could', 'begin', 'find', 'one', 'was', 'worst', 'season', 'Buffy', 'hits',

777614,A1AIRJRJQCNU5L,B0000DANYD,"jackbauerfan ""jack""","[2, 4]","And I mean solid.  This season was very different from any other season of Buffy.  Most of the other seasons follow a similar plotline.  Evil guys appear, Buffy and her friends take care of them.  This season kind of abandoned that plotline.  Instead, they focused on problems or flaws that the main characters are facing.  There are big bads in this season, the three nerds, or the trio as they are sometimes called.  They consist of Jonathan, the class dork who almost committed suicide in season 3, Warren, the guy who made the Buffy robot in the previous season, and Andrew, who is the brother of Tucker, the guy who tried to sick the hellhounds on the prom in season 3.The season starts out with Buffy and all her friends fighting some demons in the cemetery.  After a prolonged fight scene, they dispatch the demons.  Then we find out that it isn't really Buffy, it's the Buffy-bot.  Her friends want everyone to believe that Buffy is still alive so that Sunnydale will still be a safe place.  Now there are two problems I have with this.  First, if they want people to believe that Buffy is still alive, why did they erect a tombstone for her?  Secondly, who is the new slayer?  Isn't another slayer supposed to be called after the last one dies?  Like at the end of season 1, when Buffy died, and Kendra was called?  Whatever.  So Giles decides to go back to England, believing that, with Buffy gone, there is no future for him  Willow, Xander, Tara, and Anya decide to do a spell to bring Buffy back.  They think she is in some kind of hell dimension.  They do this very weird and dangerous spell, which succeeds.  Just in the nick of time, too.  A demon motorcycle gang have heard that Buffy is dead.  They decide to invade Sunnydale.  Buffy emerges from her coffin, in a confused and delerious state.  She beats all the demons, and reunites with her friends.  She tells them that she was in a hell dimension, and thanks them for bringing her out of it.  Later she tells Spike, who is still hanging around Sunnydale, that she was really in Heaven.  Every moment she spends back on the earth is torment.  She tells him not to tell her friends.I thought this was a very good setup for the season.  It was very different from anything we had seen before in this series.  Buffy does not want to be alive.  Now this is different from her whining about not wanting to be the slayer.  She does not even want to be alive.  And she is still the slayer.  She ends up starting a physical relationship with Spike, even though she hates him.  Despite the fact that it gives her a release from life, she is disgusted with herself.  And she also takes a job at a fast food place.  Sure.  Let's throw that in there.  Make her life really depressing.  At the same time, her friends are going through problems of their own.  Willow and Tara are struggling with their relationship because Tara is so bland.  Oh, and also because Willow is starting to become addicted to her magic.  Willow is going to some guy and letting him do spells on her.  I think this was supposed to be a metaphor for being addicted to drugs.  Okay, whatever.  Willow also starts to take her magic too far.  For instance, she alters Tara's memory after they have a fight.  She and Tara separate for a while.  Meanwhile, Xander and Anya decide to get married.  But at their wedding, an old man who claims to be Xander from the future appears and tells him that they cannot get married.  He shows Xander a vision of the future, in which Xander and Anya have a very disfunctional family.  It seems that Anya cheats on Xander, and they have a domen-kid.  In an argument they have, Xander appears to kill Anya.  Shocked from the vision, Xander is not sure what to do.  Then it is revealed that the old man is really a demon who was cursed by Anya and wants revenge.  They kill him, but the damage is done.  Xander sees his own alchoholic parents fighting, and decides to leave Anya at the alter.  Anya is enraged, and the head-vengeance-demon-guy gives her her powers back.  She becomes a vengeance demon again.  Now Dawn...I hate Dawn...Dawn is being as bratty as usual.  See, I thought that with Glory no longer a threat, Dawn would just disappear or something.  Nope.  She's there `till the end of the series.  And she is such a brat in this season, possibly even worse than before.  I know she lost her mother and her sister temporarily, but c'mon.  When is she gonna grow up already?  When are the writers going to make her into a likeable character, or at least give her something to do besides make our lives miserable?  Well, never.I'm going to devote a short paragraph to talking about the musical episode, ""Once More With Feeling"".  Now I'm not a big fan of musicals.  I think they're stupid.  However, I enjoyed this episode, to a point.  I think they dragged it out a little too much.  Where most episodes are about 40 minutes, this one was about an hour.  They could have cut out one or two songs.  I don't think it was anywhere near the best episode of the series, but it was entertaining.I mentioned the trio of nerds earlier.  I liked them for the first few episodes.  They were funny, and they helped to lighten an otherwise dark season.  But as the season went on, I realized that they were the big bads of the season.  I was horrified.  They were simply not evil enough to be real villians.  But as time went on, Warren started to get darker.  He starts to assert authority over Jonathan and Andrew, and he ends up murdering his ex-girlfriend in an attempt to rape her.  He ends up getting some mystical stones which gives him enhanced strength as well as invulnerability.  He and Buffy fight, and he starts to get the upper hand.  With Jonathan's help, however, Buffy manages to smash the stones and defeat Warren.  Warren manages to escape from her.  He later comes to her house and shoots at her, wounding her.  One of his stray bullets goes in the upstairs window and kills Tara.  Oh, well, not like there was much of a character to kill off, anyway.  Willow goes crazy.  After starting to get a handle on controling her magic, She goes evil and kills Warren.  Now I'd like to point out that evil Willow is very similar to Vampire Willow from season 3.  I just thought that was interesting.  As far as villians go, dark Willow was not really the best.  She just seems too sweet to be evil.  But she wasn't horrible, and it worked okay.So Willow pursues Warren and Jonathan, intent on killing them.  Buffy tries to get through to her, but is unsuccessful. Willow ends up trying to destroy the world, and is stopped just in time by Xander.  Having overcome his cowardice and self-pity, Xander manages to talk Willow out of her evil state by telling her that he loves her, no matter what she does or is about to do.  Willow eventually breaks down sobbing in Xander's arms.  I loved this scene.  I like it whenever Xander gets to do something.  I loved that Buffy was unable to get through Willow, but Xander did by reminding her of their lifelong friedship.  After Willow is stopped, Buffy realizes that her depression was very selfish and stupid.  She tells Dawn that she wants to live in the world and show Dawn the world...or something corny like that.  The season ends with Spike winning his soul back because he wants Buffy to like him...yeahhhhh.......I'll have more to say about that is my season 7 review.  Which is going to be extremely painful for me.",4,One Last Solid Season,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,7441,"['mean', 'solid', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Most',

You have to go to the gritty place. And it was of the good.I thought Spike and Buffy's sick relationship was so daring and very sexy. Seeing those bad early 20s decisions that we all made fueled by depression and a sense of floundering was nicely done and in typical Buffy fashion hyper realized just as the ""high school as hell"" concept that got this ball rolling. My hats off to the producers who took their perky cute monster fighter to a whole new and interesting level. They could have played it safe and kept Buffy the same but Buffy evolved. Some fans didn't like her so much anymore but you have to resepect her jourey. After you find out your sister is not your sister, your mom dies, and then you die, you aren't the same and I apreciate that ME didn't try to make it seem that way.Loved evil Willow and was sad to see Tara go. My only peeve is that Buffy should have been paid by the Council or all of her friends should have worked so that she could slay because it made no sense.

777616,A2R6MFHJ8CGJ06,B0000DANYD,"James Bow ""Writer, The Unwritten Girl""","[1, 1]","I'm not one to dismiss the sixth season of Buffy, not because I'm a ""besotted fan of the series"" but because it definitely had its moments. Any series, including Buffy, is going to be hard-pressed to maintain the consistent quality that Buffy achieved during its second and third seasons, but I came on board as a fan in the middle of the fifth season, and I was happy to watch the series through to its end. Clearly, if you find Buffy the Vampire Slayer entertaining enough to watch it week after week, you are going to find the sixth season box set worth buying.Although the sixth season does not have the twisty storyline of season two's Spike-Dru-Angel and season three's fight with Faith and the Mayor, it still manages to reach considerable highs, including the musical episode (""Once More With Feeling""), ""Buffy Interrupted"" and the final two-parter after Willow loses it. The only problem with the sixth season is that it is entirely too linear; Buffy is resurrected, Willow succumbs to an addiction to magic, and three entertaining former high-school losers set up shop as the season's big bad... and then not much else happens. Everybody has their path laid out for them at the beginning of the season and everybody spends much of the season following that path. It's solid and dependable action, but a little boring in retrospect. Compare this to the roller-coaster of season four of Angel where NOBODY, not even the writing staff, knew what was going to happen four or five episodes down the line.But season six isn't the weakest season of Buffy. That honour rests with season seven which shared sixth season's linearity, but sloppily raised and dropped plot elements, and failed to resolve a number of issues satisfactorily. Still, this is Buffy we're talking about. Even in its sixth season, it was one of the best television shows then in production. When the time comes for me to review the seventh season box set, it will still get a solid three stars.",4,"Not the Greatest Season, but not a Disgrace",1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,1969,"[""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'dismiss', 'sixth', 'season', 'Buffy', 'not', ""'m"", 'besotted', 'fan', 'series', 'definitely', 'had', 'moments', 'Any', 'series', 'including', 'Buffy', 'going', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'maintain', 'consistent', 'quality', 'Buffy', 'achieved', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'came', 'board', 'fan', 'middle', 'fifth', 'season', 'was', 'happy', 'watch', 'series', 'end', 'Clearly', 'find', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'watch', 'week', 'week', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'sixth', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'worth', 'sixth', 'season', 'not', 'have', 'twisty', 'storyline', 'season', 'two', 'Spike-Dru-Angel', 'season', 'three', 'fight', 'Faith', 'Mayor', 'still', 'reach', 'considerable', 'highs', 'including', 'musical', 'episode', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'Buffy', 'Interrupted', 'final', 'two-parter', 'Willow', 'only', 'problem', 'sixth', 'season', 'entirely', 'too', 'linear', 'Buffy', 'resurrected', 'Willow', 'succumbs', 'addiction', 'magic', 'three', 'entertaining', 'former', 'high-school', 'losers', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'season', 'big', 'bad', 'then', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Everybody', 'path', 'laid', 'out', 'beginning', 'season', 'everybody', 'much', 'season', 'following', 'path', 'solid', 'dependable', 'action', 'little', 'boring', 'retrospect', 'Compare', 'roller-coaster', 'season', 'four', 'Angel', 'where', 'NOBODY', 'not', 'even', 'writing', 'staff', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'four', 'five', 'episodes', 'line.But', 'season', 'six', ""n't"", 'weakest', 'season', 'Buffy', 'honour', 'rests', 'season', 'seven', 'shared', 'sixth', 'season', 'linearity', 'sloppily', 'raised', 'dropped', 'plot', 'elements', 'failed', 'resolve', 'number', 'issues', 'satisfactorily', 'Still', 'Buffy', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Even', 'sixth', 'season', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'shows', 'then', 'production', 'When', 'time', 'review', 'seventh', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'will', 'still', 'get', 'solid', 'three', 'stars']",N/A
777617,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0000DANYD,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[2, 6]","BEWARE: SPOILERS AHEAD.BUFFY's Season 6 has a few terrific highlights, like the now-classic ""Once More With Feeling"" musical episode and ""Hell's Bells"", the Xander/Anya wedding episode, and the whole Giles/Willow confrontation.Aside from that, there are a spare few episodes that work in a traditional BTVS way, but the season as a whole is a mess. Essentially the whole season is the classic X-MEN ""Dark Phoenix"" storyline coming to the Buffyverse, where the main focus is not really on Buffy and her resurrection, but of Willow and her spiraling further and further down into the abyss of her abuse of dark magicks.Yes, the whole season is pretty much a high-school special about the dangers of drug abuse. Willow even causes an accident that harms Dawn.It's also a treatise on self-abuse and self-destruction, which are compelling frontiers to cross for Buffy and the Scoobies, but it's a tale that ultimately feels too familiar and too rushed. The ""relationship"" between Spike and Buffy feels forced, like it's merely a plot device to advance Spike's character and to reflect how Buffy continues to punish herself for her myriad issues with her resurrection.As much as I LOVE BTVS and Joss Whedon, Buffy's character is one of great triumph over horror, but it's also heavily laden with Survivor's Guilt. Especially since she's actually survived death. And again, this is very compelling, but this season plays it out much too on-the-nose. The season itself is very dark, and that's something that, as a rule, I don't have an issue with, but with all the darkness that permeated the great Season Five, and with this running concurrently with the very dark (and ultimately superior) ANGEL spinoff series, I was hoping that Joss would give a little more light and fluffy to BTVS.In Season Six, we didn't get that.

I intend to own three seasons of Buffy: two, three, and six. When someone goes through a traumatic event you don't go back to being just fine overnight. I thought that the fact that they went into the Scoobies dealing with real world problems like getting a loan was a breath of fresh air. We've spent the last five years seeing Buffy and everyone wearing designer clothes and having her house destroyed at least once a season. Money comes from somewhere. I liked the fact that they delt with the practical difficulties of being the Slayer and that there were some problems that you don't just stake to get rid of. That begs the question: Why doesn't the Slayer get paid? The Watchers get paid, as we learned in season 5. The Slayer should too. Anyway...People who complain about season six, get over it! In season one the story arc isn't well defined and the characters aren't developed. Season 4 has just as much dissention without the interesting character development. And in season 7 they don't even kill the Big Bad. Anyway, Kennedy is so annoying! The fact that she didn't die in the last episode is reason enough to condemn season 7.Anyway, I liked season 6.

I agree that it was the darkest yet but also one of the most brilliant seasons ever. My favorite season was the third season but this sixth season follows closely as my second favorite season. Some of the episodes had me laughing out loud, others made me cry and others made me sit back in awe. Joss Whedon is a brilliant man that just brings this incredible magic onto the screen. Props to him.Bargaining 1&amp;2...intense. I love how Buffy portrayed all her confusion, fright and sadness.Once More With Feeling was one of the most incredible pieces of work ever, it definetley deserved an Emmy.  Tabula Rasa was hilarious. I loved how everyone lost their memory...Giles being Spike's father? Pure comedy.Smashed has one of the hottest scenes of TV history EVER. I love the whole interaction with Buffy and Spike.Gone...sheer genius. Invisible Buffy was too funny and Spike doing Invisible Buffy with Xander walking in had me laughing hard.Doublemeat Palace was great in the sense that Buffy becomes a real person who actually works to support her and her sister instead of complaining about the lack of money she finally does what any normal person would do: Get a job.Hells Bells was very good, Anya's walk down the aise was the saddest thing ever.Normal Again was SUPERB. The creativness behind it just blows me away everytime I watch it. I STILL wonder if maybe that alternate reality really WAS  Buffy's life and maybe Sunnydale was all in her mind. You never know.Seeing Red, this one I will complain about just for the whole attempted rape. That part just kills me everytime. I love Spike and Buffy together and I hated that they added that into their storyline.Dark Willow...Willow's stronger than ever this season and the ending is a shocker. Some parts had me squirming, like, is that really the sweet little Willow we all love? But it's something that has to happen and it's great. Best part? No more Tara.I did find that Dawn got way too annoying. Especially in Older and Faraway. I swear, I just wanted to slap her and I actually enjoyed when in the finale Willow taunted her and mocked her. I would've told her to get some friends of her own and stop being such a whiny little baby.Spike's the real twist and shocker in the season finale and it was one of the best things ever.As for the Extra features:The TV with a bite was an awesome addition. I loved watching how the series developed through the years.The outakes weren't all that good.

There really is no all-powerful supernatural being raising hell-on-earth (at least not until the very end) in season six. This is the season where Buffy rises from the grave. However, Buffy was in heaven, so being brought back is hell for her. She feels that she can only tell this information to Spike, for she assumes, possibly correctly, that no one else could comprehend this. The secret comes out, however, in the episode ""Once More, With Feeling."" The Spike and Buffy relationship is definately one of the highlights of this season. While it definately feels wrong (at least to me), it does make for interesting viewing. This relationship comes to a sickening climax in ""Seeing Red."" It is in this episode where Spike attempts to rape Buffy. This is not an easy scene to watch. We also see the sad (but enevitable) break-up of Xander and Anya in the episode ""Hell's Bells."" Tara and Willow's romance also comes to an end in ""Tabula Rasa."" See, Willow becomes heavily addicted to magic, and uses a spell to make Tara forget her many indiscretions. Tara finds out, and this is the relationship's undoing. After nearly killing Dawn, Willow is forced into ""rehab."" (The drug metaphor is not subtle. A two year old could pick up on it.) Notice how I have not mentioned a major villian yet. There isn't one. Okay, there's the ""Nerd Trio"" (Warren, Johnathan, and Andrew). However, seeing as Buffy could easily squash them like insects, they merely count as distractions. That is until Warren shoots Buffy, and kills Tara. This sets off a chain of events causing Willow to take a very dark turn. Through blinding rage and despair, Willow sets off to kill Warren, and everyone else on earth. However, Xander's love for her ultimately saves the world from the wrath of her destruction. This is definately a pivitol season, as well as the darkest season. Many fans did not like this season, but I found it highly enjoyable. There are many great episodes, including: ""Once More, With Feeling,"" ""Tabula Rasa,"" ""Normal Again,"" ""Hell's Bells,"" ""Seeing Red,"" ""Villains,"" ""Two To Go,"" and ""Grave."" ""Once More, With Feeling"" is definately the best episode of the season. It is a musical episode, but it definately doesn't feel gimmicky. The cast does a superior job (seriously, WHERE ARE THEIR EMMYS?!) and it is a pivitol episode, seeing as many secrets are revealed, each with a catchy musical number.

(I have every episode on videotape, and am slowly moving those tapes into storage as the seasons become available on DVD). After rewatching all 22 eps., you know what? It turned out to be a really, really good season. Even eps that bothered me before like ""Flooded"" and ""All the Way"" were really fantastic in retrospect. Even the geeks were less annoying (and in much fewer eps than I had remembered). This is really Buffy at its darkest. The geeks are really a smokescreen (even though Warren did kill his ex-girlfriend and Tara, and tried to kill Buffy)--the real ""demons"" that Buffy & Co. faced this season were themselves. Willow gets heavily addicted to Magic, Buffy is morose about coming back and gets addicted to Spike, Xander's insecurities about himself causes him to lose Anya, and Dawn's percieved loneliness causes her to get into quite a few jams (stealing, lying to Buffy, etc.). By the season's end, everything comes full circle, and everyone involved learns quite a few things about themselves.It is interesting to note too, that two of the Buffy episodes that usually make viewers' favorite lists are in this season: ""Once More With Feeling"", and ""Tabula Rasa.""

I watched Buffy from the time it came out until it went off the air, bought every season and watched all of Angel as well. Needless to say, I am a huge fan of the show and of Joss. For me, season 6 was by far the best season. I loved the evil trio, they were hysterical. The only other big bad I liked as much was the Mayor. I guess I like big bads with attitude and quippy remarks. I also liked to see Buffy really struggle for once. She lost her mom season 5, she lost her life and then lost her spot in heaven. She was having a bad day, let the girl be depressed for crying out loud! Yes, she was brought down by Spike, but Spike was brought up by her. I think their like-mindedness were good to see playing off of one another. Some of the best acting was done this season. I love Willow but it was also good to see her lose it. Having Giles gone for part of the season was sad but necessary and when he shows back up it is this amazing feeling of wholeness, exactly what Joss was going for.

777629,A14NOMKJAZ4Z8M,B0000DANYD,"Jeremy Robertson ""Jeremy Roberson""","[1, 3]","Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Sixth Season is mostly about growing up, and what it would be like if our characters grew in different directions.  It was probably one of the most remarkable moments in television history.  There was a lot of confusion in which some people had their differences about their thoughts on the sixth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  When Buffy had died last season, her friends feared she was trapped in a hell-dimension, and needed to be ressurected.  But as they later learn, Buffy tells Spike that she was in fact in Heaven, not in Hell.  Spike was the only one who knew about this, because Buffy still has feelings for the vampire with a soul.  Then, we later discover that a music-making demon called Sweet (Hinton Battle) that has been summoned to Sunnydale and makes the whole town burst into song (and not to mention flame!) This was probably notably the only episode with a shaft of lightness throughout the whole season.  Well, there was ""Tabula Rasa,"" which followed the episode after the highly critically acclaimed musical episode ""Once More, With Feeling."" ""Tabula Rasa"" was about Tara having to plea over the fact that Willow was using too much magick and needed to make a pact that if she were to use or do one more speel, then their relationship would have to end.  But Willow went ahead and made a spell to make them forget that Buffy was ever in Heaven, but when it goes wrong, it instead makes them forget who they are. This season also marks the death of Tara, in which Willow goes all evil on the gang and decides to destroy the world since Warren made a terrible mistake in killing her girlfriend, not to mention shooting Buffy at the same time.  Willow is set out to conquer the world, only to be stopped by Xander's love and setting the evil witch the lies within Willow.  It was a tough season, but still has some great episodes worth watching over and over.  Most notably, ""Once More, With Feeling,"" is a must.

A large part of this was the mishandling of the whole Dark Willow plotline. Making magic act like drugs just didn't work, nor did it fit in with what we've seen past shows.  Yes, there were hints that overusing magic could be a problem, but the problem was more of the ""power corrupts"" sort (like the one ring in Tolkien), not a physical addiction. And several of the episodes of Willow dealing with this were among the worst the show has ever produced. (In fact, I'd rank ""Wrecked"" next to any episode at the bottom of the list.)  On the other hand, I really liked ""Normal Again,"" which I know a number of people didn't like.Overall, the season was a disapointment, after a season 5 that seemed to recover some of the energy of seasons 2 and 3.

She's not that happy that she was brought back though and her friends don't know that. Well not right away anyway. Spike surprisingly is the only person she found that she could talk to about it. After a Demom comes along that can make people sing and dance their feelings out, Buffy has no choice but  to sing it out to her friends that she was actually in Heaven. She was happy there too. Now that she's back, she finds that she needs a job so she can keep the house and support her sister Dawn.The show just turns really silly but still entertaing when 3 nerds decide they want to try and take out Buffy. They make her invisible in 1 episode and they try a lot of other things as well. The leader of the nerds Warren gets more and more evil and more and more frustrated that he can't kill Buffy. He eventually snaps and while shooting Buffy he kills a member of Slayer gang in the process. This is when things turn darker and a lot more violent. The death of the friend makes Willow snap and use very dark magic so she can hunt Warren and the nerds down. Buffy surprisingly doesn't save the day but someone elsee does but I won't say who for those who didn't see this season. I just found that clever though.Just to throw in there, Buffy is pretty mean to Spike in this season ""I know surprise surpise"" but even more mean than usual.

I didn't think that was right but still was interesting to see them going from enemies to having sex behind a tree in front of Buffy's house lol.

Willow's addiction, Xander leaving Anya at the alter, the geek triumverate... Buffy and Spike having graphic sex. And I am a big fan of Spike. LOVE Spike. That was just out of character for her.Very night time soap opera this seaon. But the highlights were there too. Once more with feeling (the singing episode) - even with its lame ending, the music was very catchy. The acting was great. The characters were all there (though Giles was missed after his 6 episodes - his final episode where they all lose their memory due to one of Willow's spells is one of the best of the season). Dawn is less annoying in this season than in the 5th.It felt like the writers were trying to hit the audience over the head with their true to life comparisons. There was a lot of addiction and escapism (and heck, crime - Dawn and Shoplifting, Willow and her homicide) for the characters in this season. The characters had never really crossed the line like that really. Yet all is forgiven. A lot of that - addiction and escapism is natural for people in their early 20s. Problems are more personal and more complicated. But a lot of the story lines were too over the top for the characters.It works though... If you love the show. And the 7th season found it's footing again - though somewhat rocky.It looks as though there are extras that will make the DVDs worth buying plus there needs to be continuity to my collection. The worst season in the series - by far - and yet, still - It was one of the best shows on television.

777636,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,B0000DANYD,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[14, 15]","This is the ""dark"" season of Buffy, the ""darkest the show ever got.""  Or so the majority of reviews on here would have you believe.  I disagree.  Season Six of Buffy is not dark.  It's DARK COMEDY.There's a huge difference between the two, but, just to lay my opinion on the line before we get into the meat of the review, I'll say this: I'm one of the few who really enjoyed Season Four.  Why, when so many Buffy fans hated it?  Because it was adult in nature, because it didn't operate in a world of black and white.  Season Five diluted this adult feel with the appearance and focus on pre-teen Dawn; whereas so many Buffy fans adored Season Five, I mostly disliked it.  And whereas most of them disliked Season Six, I liked it a lot, and I'm sure you know why: because it returned to the adult nature that was so refreshing in Season Four.But back to the dark/dark comedy debate.  Let's look at the facts.  Season Six features Buffy coming back to life, and she's not so happy her heart's beating once again.  Dark?  Sure, but is it as dark as Buffy, you know, DYING at the end of Season Five?  Season Six also features the death of a major character.  Of course that's dark, but one must bear in mind that this death comes late in the season, and it's a fast death, whereas Season Five featured Buffy's mother dying of a brain tumor, a long and painful death which lasted over several episodes.  Let's also not forget the episodes which followed, each of which meditated morbidly upon her death (Season Five's ""The Body"" being the prime representative).  Season Six features Willow being seduced by dark magick.  That's definitely dark, but is it as dark as young Dawn discovering in Season Five that she'd only existed for a few months, and then defiantly slashing her own wrists to see if she was real?  Oh wait, I forgot.  Buffy has to work in a fast-food joint to pay the bills in Season Six.  So obviously this really IS the ""darkest"" season.Do you see the skewed reasoning yet?  These Buffy fans are claiming that flipping burgers and trying to make ends meet is not only darker than dying slowly and painfully of a brain tumor, but also than the main character dying in the last episode of the season. Flawed logic; the same sort of flawed logic which claimed that Season Four wasn't any good, just because it was different from the preceding three, teen-focused seasons.Season Five was the true ""dark"" season, and where many of its episodes became mired in melodrama (witness Buffy actually breaking down in the penultimate episode of Season Five), Season Six featured a welcome return of the Simpsons-esque comedy so prevalent in Season Four.  This is most notable in the character Spike.  In Season Four he was at his best, trading insults with the Scoobies while secretly working against them.  Season Five found Spike devolved into a lovesick puppy, reduced to giving Dawn ""there, there, little Bit"" pep talks every episode as he pined away for her big sister.  Season Six sees Spike once again an antihero; once he gets his paws on Buffy (who sleeps with Spike only because it makes her feel alive) he becomes one of the most lecherous characters in television history.  He holds it over Buffy's head that at any moment he could spoil her secret to the Scoobies, and strives to sway her to the dark side more successfully than Faith was able to in Season Three.  But the laughs don't just rest with Spike; Season Six is filled with dark comedy, from Xander and Anya's bizarre demon-filled wedding to the villainous ""Trio"" arguing over geek culture while plotting Buffy's death.This brings me to another point: the Trio.  Hated by most Buffy fans, the Trio will always be voted the ""worst villains ever on Buffy.""  Three geeks who collect toys and dabble in sorcery; how could they compete with the main villains of past seasons?  But that's the point.  Where else could the Buffy producers go, after having their hero battle a god in Season Five?  Instead of trying to one-up Glory in the power department, they went the other route, and had Buffy face off against a pack of nerds.  A brave decision, and one that went over most fans, but I appreciated it, because to tell the truth, I really liked the Trio.  Probably all of us have wondered what it would be like to be a supervillain.  The Trio carry this dream out, and the results are always humorous to watch.The first season on the UPN network, Season Six had a bigger budget, most of which seems to have gone to better special effects, costuming, and makeup.  There's no noticeable difference in the production quality; watching this on DVD, you wouldn't really notice any differences between Seasons Five and Six, so for that reason the move from the WB to UPN was unnoticeable in terms of production.  There was also no change in the quality of the cast: as always, acting is uniformly excellent in Season Six.  My only complaint would be that some of the characters don't have much to do.  Xander and Anya do little more than plan their wedding throughout most of the season, and Dawn brings nothing to the table.  In fact, Dawn's useless presence this season only reinforces my opinion that she should have died in Season Five, instead of Buffy.  Not only would that have given Dawn the opportunity to actually DO something for others, instead of whine all the time, it would also have provided all sorts of avenues for the writers to pursue; who knows how Buffy would react, with both her mother and her sister dead?There are a spate of great episodes this season: ""Bargaining,"" the two-parter that opens Season Six, starts off strong with a group of Hell's Angel demons (featuring some great makeup for the demons) taking over Sunnydale, and also impresses in that Gellar is on-screen throughout the first part, but we don't think of her as Buffy, as her portrayal of the Buffybot really makes her seem like a different character.  Great acting; just more evidence of what a talented actress Gellar really is.  ""Doublemeat Palace"" is another episode I enjoyed a lot, though most Buffy fans apparently hated it; it's a Season One episode with a bigger budget, as Buffy gets a job flipping burgers but soon finds a monster on the premises.  Lots of comedy in this one, included a very Simpsons-esque training video Buffy has to watch.Another episode that stands out is ""Wrecked,"" which, beyond its overbearing (and too unsubtle) ""magick as drugs"" subtext, features some far-out and very cool ""tripping"" sequences, as Willow surfs on dark magick.  Another good one (and another Season One-type episode) is ""Older and Far Away,"" in which the Scoobies are trapped in the Summers residence, which leads to lots of laughs.  ""Tabula Rasa"" is another standout episode: the Scoobies have their memories erased, and have to piece together who they are; this leads to the one and only appearance of ""Joan the Vampire Slayer,"" who thinks a vampire with a soul sounds like a stupid idea.To tell the truth, I can't think of a single episode this season that I didn't enjoy, save perhaps ""All the Way,"" the Halloween episode, which focused on Dawn for an hour, before realizing too late the character has little to offer other than constant whining.  The only other thing I can complain about is that some of Willow and Tara's magick this season looks a bit too much like the junk you'll see in ""Charmed;"" all they do is wave their hand, and computer graphics knock their opponents down.  Makes me miss the old days of magick on Buffy, when characters would actually recite rituals.  Still fantasy, sure, but at least more believable than the superheroic stuff you'll occasionally see this season.My five favorite episodes of the season (in order of airdate):1. Life Serial: A funny, quirky comedy that harkens back to the show's golden days.  Of course, it's a Jane Espenson script, which explains a lot - the woman was the best writer the show had.  Buffy goes from ill-fated job to job, all the while haunted by the devious Trio.  Eventually she turns to drinking hard liquor and hanging out in seedy bars with Spike; Buffy's ""blugh"" noises every time she takes a shot of whiskey are the funniest thing in an episode filled with laughs.2. Once More, With Feeling: I thought I'd hate it, but I mostly loved it.  Some of the songs are a bit too long and there could've been a bit more variety in the musical styles, but overall, this is a bold and entertaining episode, one of the very best.  The only episode Whedon wrote and directed all season, it runs several minutes long and is the most cinematic the show ever got.  Plus, the episode is in widescreen!  (Too bad the whole set isn't.)  The story concerns a demon who comes to Sunnydale and causes everyone to sing spontaneously; wackiness and great television ensues.3. Gone: An unusual choice, but I couldn't help but love it.  Buffy barely appears (rumor has it that Gellar wanted a break after ""Once More, With Feeling""), but this episode is not only light-hearted, but also full of laughs.  Turned invisible by the Trio, Buffy takes a situation that would freak most people out, and instead yuks it up.  Really, this is the most endearing Buffy's been for years: pulling practical jokes on her friends and paying Spike an illicit visit while Xander cluelessly watches on.4. Normal Again: One of the best episodes of the entire series.  What if the Buffyverse wasn't ""real,"" but instead the psychotic delusions of Buffy Summers?  Poisoned by a demon, Buffy begins to hallucinate that she's really in a mental hospital, where she's been interred for the past 6 years, imagining the previous six seasons.  But what if it isn't the demon's poison creating these hallucinations - what if the poison instead has allowed her to see reality?  Cleverly poking fun at Season Six itself by unfavorably comparing it to earlier seasons, Normal Again is a psychological thriller that takes Buffy into new realms.  A solid classic, it ends on a bold note, offering no real answers.5. Two To Go/Grave: Aired as a two-parter, though not intended as such when the episodes were filmed, the final two episodes of the season pack a great one-two punch.  The main villain of the season is revealed (you probably already know that it's Willow; the DVD box even gives it away), Giles returns, and lots of action and magickal chaos ensues.  The end is a bit clich&eacute;d, as Buffy and Dawn happily walk off into what looks like a Coke commercial, but who can complain when you get to see Buffy and Dark Willow trying to beat each other to death?The DVD set is of pristine audio and video quality, though again it's fullscreen, while the European release is widescreen.  Creator Joss Whedon has endlessly claimed that Buffy was intended to be seen in fullscreen; hence the US release follows his wishes.  But one can't deny the cinematic quality of ""Once More, With Feeling,"" which is presented on this set in widescreen, and wonder how the rest of the series would look in the same format.  It also appears that, despite Whedon's statements, the Director of Photography often framed shots in a way that would benefit from widescreen presentation; several viewers of the overseas releases claim that many details are revealed in the widescreen prints, all of which are hidden by the fullscreen aspect.  However, before you rush out to buy expensive, imported Buffy DVD sets in widescreen, bear in mind that they are available as PAL only.  Not only will you need a multiregion DVD player to play those discs, but also PAL runs a few seconds faster than NTSC, so the voices you know and love from Buffy will sound different.  Willow in particular sounds really weird on the foreign releases, her voice sped up and unrecognizable from Alyson Hannigan's real voice.Long story short: Season Six is unjustly reviled.  I think it's one of the better seasons in the series' history, and a lot of these ""Season Six sucks!"" sentiments are just knee-jerk reactions.

After an incredible and moving season end in Season 5, we get this mish-mash of poor story arcs.  Of course the one shining episode was the one that was written by Joss Whedon, Once More With Feeling.  The songs in the episode actually move the story further and has the most character development of any episode of the entire series run.  I could go on and on about this episode, but it was just one of many on this set.

777640,A1WBUBTKM25S22,B0000DANYD,Jonathan Bogner,"[6, 8]","Truth be told, Buffy's sixth season is its weakest. Aside from the amateurish symptoms that slightly bogged down the impeccable first season, six is the only year that substantially weakened the show's devout mythology by wading in it instead of expanding it. Admittedly, the self-referential qualities of Buffy have always been part of it's charm; the problem here, though, is that self-referencing is somehow supposed to pass off as plot. Examine: Jonathan (the powerless bystander who hitherto had been more or less orbiting the world of Buffy and was the source for two of the most inspired episodes of seasons 3 and 4) teams up with Warren (the borderline-creepy recluse who builds robots to fornicate with) and Andrew (who's sole claim to existence in the Buffyverse is that his brother, Tucker, tried to ruin prom with a pack of hell-hounds) to become evil masterminds and take over Sunnydale.While in theory this sounds like an entertaining angle to toy with, the whole Nerds of Doom routine gets old. Fast. It doesn't help that all three characters are decidedly set on their moral paths that would no doubt come to a head at the end of the season: Jonathan: good but misguided, Warren: Evil. And in the case of Andrew, season seven's star player, he was given exactly one joke to play (is he gay?) the whole year.Understandably, Andrew's character didn't grow in depth until both his friends were dead and he finally had to start thinking for himself: A valid character development but one that wouldn't pan out until next season.As for the Scoobies, this wasn't a banner year for them as well. Buffy's main arc the whole season (instead of rescuing her from hell, her friends had yanked her from heaven) was inspired and, up through Once More with Feeling was treated with delicacy. Afterwards, the impressionable Slayer began a torrid affair with Spike, became invisible, went crazy, worked at a fast food restaurant, et al. until she finally had an epiphany when, coming full circle, she climbed out of a grave this time to see green fields and flowers instead of motor bike demons.Willow's arc was possibly the most irksome of the bunch. Anticipated a year ago, in season five, the ""addicted to magic"" storyline was way too blatant and ultimately led to a finale that no-one hadn't predicted. With rumors running rampant the whole year that a Scooby was going to bite it, Tara was the obvious choice to go since Amber Benson seemed to be the most loosely affiliated member of the cast and since common knowledge led you to the realization that Tara dead = Willow mad.Giles' decision to leave, also anticipated in season five, was (before the season had even begun) public knowledge and, thus, taken with a grain of salt. Giles had been the cornerstone of the show for some years now and without him, suffice to say, the show suffered.Spike, reeling from the Slayer's death, continued on his path as accidental hero and ultimately served as Buffy's connection in the world. His much maligned attempted rape of Buffy sent him on his sojourn to Africa which, as we all know, restored his sole and instigated the final season of the show.Meanwhile, Xander, Dawn and Anya were treated as merely peripheral to the plot with a few crumbs tossed their way once and a while.No one in season six changed. That may be my biggest qualm with the season. Everyone was stuck in a funk the whole year and the show's tone got noticeably monotonous. The actors looked like they were sleepwalking through most of the season, the scripts lacked the wit and heart that Buffy was known for and the production just seemed sloppy. It wasn't until season seven that we felt the ramifications of everyone's actions in season six and because of that, most of the year is merely exposition for the final chapter.I don't hate season six. For the aforementioned missteps I would undoubtedly call this the show's weakest year. Paradoxically, though, I don't think anyone could deny Once More with Feeling the accolades it so deserves. Everything in the episode works. For one time that year everything and everyone was working in perfect synergy to create an undeniably brilliant work of art that confirmed Joss Whedon as one of the most giddily self-assured auteurs working in any medium over the last decade. Did the best episode of the series stem from the weakest season? You decide.With Angel simultaneously churning out of the Buffy-verses best season's ever and the brilliance of season seven that was to come, it's not entirely an insult to say that the year was lacking. With such high standards, it probably isn't an insult at all.",4,Where do we go from here?,1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,4624,"['Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Buffy', 'sixth', 'season', 'weakest', 'Aside', 'amateurish', 'symptoms', 'slightly', 'bogged', 'impeccable', 'first', 'season', 'six', 'only', 'year', 'substantially', 'weakened', 'show', 'devout', 'mythology', 'wading', 'instead', 'expanding', 'Admittedly', 'self-referential', 'qualities', 'Buffy', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'part', 'charm', 'problem', 'here', 'self-referencing', 'somehow', 'supposed', 'pass', 'off', 'plot', 'Examine', 'Jonathan', 'powerless', 'bystander', 'who', 'hitherto', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'less', 'orbiting', 'world', 'Buffy', 'was', 'source', 'two', 'most', 'inspired', 'episodes', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'teams', 'up', 'Warren', 'borderline-creepy', 'recluse', 'who', 'robots', 'fornicate', 'Andrew', 'who', 'sole', 'claim', 'existence', 'Buffyverse', 'brother', 'Tucker', 'tried', 'ruin', 'prom', 'pack', 'hell-hounds', 'become', 'evil', 'masterminds', 'take', 'over', 'Sunnydale.While', 'theory', 'entertaining', 'angle', 'toy', 'whole', 'Nerds', 'Doom', 'routine', 'old', 'Fast', ""n't"", 'help', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'decidedly', 'set', 'moral', 'paths', 'would', 'doubt', 'come', 'head', 'end', 'season', 'Jonathan', 'good', 'misguided', 'Warren', 'Evil', 'case', 'Andrew', 'season', 'seven', 'star', 'player', 'was', 'given', 'exactly', 'one', 'joke', 'play', 'gay', 'whole', 'year.Understandably', 'Andrew', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'depth', 'friends', 'were', 'dead', 'finally', 'had', 'start', 'thinking', 'valid', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'next', 'season.As', 'Scoobies', 'was', ""n't"", 'banner', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'Buffy', 'main', 'whole', 'season', 'instead', 'rescuing', 'hell', 'friends', 'had', 'yanked', 'heaven', 'was', 'inspired', 'up', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'was', 'treated', 'delicacy', 'Afterwards', 'impressionable', 'Slayer', 'began', 'torrid', 'affair', 'Spike', 'became', 'invisible', 'went', 'crazy', 'worked', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'al', 'finally', 'had', 'epiphany', 'when', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'climbed', 'grave', 'time', 'see', 'green', 'fields', 'flowers', 'instead', 'motor', 'demons.Willow', 'arc', 'was', 'possibly', 'most', 'irksome', 'bunch', 'Anticipated', 'year', 'ago', 'season', 'five', 'addicted', 'magic', 'storyline', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'blatant', 'ultimately', 'led', 'finale', 'no-one', 'had', ""n't"", 'predicted', 'rumors', 'running', 'rampant', 'whole', 'year', 'Scooby', 'was', 'going', 'bite', 'Tara', 'was', 'obvious', 'choice', 'go', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'seemed', 'be', 'most', 'loosely', 'affiliated', 'member', 'cast', 'common', 'knowledge', 'led', 'realization', 'Tara', 'dead', '=', 'Willow', 'mad.Giles', 'decision', 'leave', 'also', 'anticipated', 'season', 'five', 'was', 'season', 'had', 'even', 'begun', 'public', 'knowledge', 'thus', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'Giles', 'had', 'been', 'cornerstone', 'show', 'years', 'now', 'suffice', 'say', 'show', 'suffered.Spike', 'reeling', 'Slayer', 'death', 'continued', 'path', 'accidental', 'hero', 'ultimately', 'served', 'Buffy', 'connection', 'world', 'much', 'maligned', 'attempted', 'rape', 'Buffy', 'sent', 'sojourn', 'Africa', 'know', 'restored', 'sole', 'instigated', 'final', 'season', 'show.Meanwhile', 'Xander', 'Dawn', 'Anya', 'were', 'treated', 'merely', 'peripheral', 'plot', 'few', 'crumbs', 'tossed', 'way', 'once', 'while.No', 'one', 'season', 'six', 'changed', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'qualm', 'season', 'Everyone', 'was', 'stuck', 'funk', 'whole', 'year', 'show', 'tone', 'got', 'noticeably', 'monotonous', 'actors', 'looked', 'were', 'sleepwalking', 'most', 'season', 'scripts', 'lacked', 'wit', 'heart', 'Buffy', 'was', 'known', 'production', 'just', 'seemed', 'sloppy', 'was', ""n't"", 'season', 'seven', 'felt', 'ramifications', 'everyone', 'actions', 'season', 'six', 'most', 'year', 'merely', 'exposition', 'final', 'chapter.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'season', 'six', 'aforementioned', 'missteps', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'call', 'show', 'weakest', 'year', 'Paradoxically', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'deny', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'accolades', 'so', 'Everything', 'episode', 'one', 'time', 'year', 'everything', 'everyone', 'was', 'working', 'perfect', 'synergy', 'create', 'undeniably', 'brilliant', 'work', 'art', 'confirmed', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'one', 'most', 'giddily', 'self-assured', 'auteurs', 'working', 'medium', 'last', 'decade', 'best', 'episode', 'series', 'stem', 'weakest', 'season', 'decide.With', 'Angel', 'simultaneously', 'churning', 'Buffy-verses', 'best', 'season', 'ever', 'brilliance', 'season', 'seven', 'was', 'come', 'not', 'entirely', 'insult', 'say', 'year', 'was', 'lacking', 'such', 'high', 'standards', 'probably', ""n't"", 'insult']",N/A

777642,A5H8VLE7L7SB,B0000DANYD,Jose,"[11, 21]","Please, don't get me wrong and I beg those who loved it to forgive me, but I found this season deeply disappointing. I really understood the dark concept of the season, the dramatic twist needed after something as strong as Buffy's dead had to be huge just as the season pretended. But it failed, and believe me, that made me go through a crisis because Joss Whedon is one of my heroes. I tried to like it, I really tried, but it wasn't enough...A lot of people found this season interesting, and believe me, I did too. It wasn't a horrible season, but it was not ""Buffy"" anymore. Joss Whedon had me glued to my TV after the extraordinary concept introduced in season one, the  gothic feeling of season two, the amazing, intelligent and powerful season three, the well executed season four that proved a series can take risks and survive, and course, the  unforgettable, epic, beyond words and unbelievable season five.But season six lost it. It seemed to me more like a supernatural soap opera rather than the epic and magical TV series it used to be. The darkness was badly handled through a melodramatic touch that contrasted too much with the comedy, leading to horrible things like a shark headed mafia demon and the cancelled ""(cartoon circus) wedding"" that just made me feel there was no more climax with the story arcs of the principal characters.The 3 geeks were funny but should not have been treated as season villains, they just didn't have enough dramatic force to interact with Buffy that way. Perhaps, this lack of climax is what ruined the good character development of the season (one of the good points) to me.Willows fall to darkness came to late. The intention of bringing the Scooby Gang as the season point of development wasn't fulfilled properly. Willow herself had her great moments, but both her fall and recovery were to sudden (the antecedents of the event were good, but the change of heart still was too abrupt), almost like improvised (I know it wasn't, but it felt like that if compared to the excellent story development of previous seasons)Perhaps one of my problems was that the scripts of the season felt a little amateur. The idea was good, but the execution lacked something. My guess is that it wasn't good for the series going to UPN.In the other hand, there are some good points about the season like Spike's character development and Buffy's desperation to handle a house and a sister. The twists were also good (but lost a lot of power due to the bad storytelling)The season itself is worth for fans and those who loved the style of the season. But in my case, despite been a big fan I think I'm going to buy season five and consider it the end (and what a great end) of it. Season seven was better than season six, in fact it had a wonderful big bad, but the tone was still polluted (specially with the addition of Andrew - I hated so much he survived and Anya didn't, hadn't that freak been there I would have enjoyed the show)The point is that I can live without the DVD's  of the last two seasons, but I can't without the ones first five seasons. I'll keep the VHS's where I recorded season six and seven, but the economy isn't great and I don't think it's worth the money.

777644,A2KXQ1CIU9B8Z2,B0000DANYD,JR,"[1, 2]","Let me begin by saying that for the first time there was way too much Buffy and Spike. At times it seemed, almost episode after episode focused on their extreme degradation. Sarah Michelle Gellar herself was not pleased and Whedon, though present, did not orchestrate the whole season. That out of the way, do not avoid season 6. As one person pointed it out, its apparent lack of direction at times it indicative of the lives of the characters. They are literally on their own, with no one to guide them, and they are all struggling and lost. Spike, Buffy, Giles, Xander, Willow, Anya, Dawn, Tara, all of them. Remembering that the premise of this season is that Willow brings Buffy back from the dead, its underlying darkness for the entire season does take on a relentless, very watchable sequence of episodes that draw us into the darkness with them. Buffy of course must struggle with life after death, literally. Willow must struggle with her addiction to witchcraft, which is used as a metaphore for drug addiction, Xander and Anya are falling to pieces, and no one cares about Dawn. Giles is just sick of all of them, period. It is all worth it however for the most beloved episode ever ""Once more with Feeling"" A brilliant episode that sparkled with the charm of a broadway musical.  We also see super nerd Warren become super dangerous to all of them. And of course, we get Dark Witch Willow whos demonic rage is uleashed thanks to Warren. It is the flip side of Vampire Willow, and this time there is no way to destroy an amulet and stop it. Be prepared for a very very dark season, with funny moments. No matter how this seasons falls with you, it is essential in the cog of the Buffy Universe. See it for yourself, the season wil stay with you for some time, whether you like it or not.Season 6, Episode 1: Bargaining: Part 1Original Air Date--2 October 2001Buffy is dead, and the Scooby Gang must do the best they can without her.

However, I cannot bring myself to purchase this (the 2nd worst)or the last season (the worst).  BTVS lost its its soul in the 6th season. The finale to season 5 was so good, and so heart felt, that it was an absolute travesty that the show continued with 2 lack lusters seasons.  They should have ended the series and let Buffy die nobely in saving her sister (the key) & the world from utter destruction.  But instead, chose to resurrect Buffy & drag the show out a couple of more seasons in order to milk it for more money.  It seems like the writers ran out of ideas starting with this season.  The only highlight in this lackluster season is the musical episode.  Other than that it was just one disappointing episode after another.  How many times can we see the geek trio go up against Buffy & the gang & fail?  As if they even have a chance!  Its absolutely pointless! To even consider such a notion is ludicrous.  Then, as if the writers realized that they needed to actually do something with the season, went overboard by having Willow go to the darkside because of Terra's death.  She tries to kill all of her friends.  Then, she literally rips one of the geek trio's skin right off his body & then tries to finish some ancient satanic ritual that was to destroy the world.  Only by Over dosing on extra magic that Giles brings back from some witches coucil can possibly bring her back, but a catalist is needed.  Zander's friendship touches her last piece of humanity and finally drains enough of her powers so that she finally gets a grip on things & breaks down & weeps all over Zander.  Boo hoo!!!  I don't know who was crying worse, the character or me for such a terrible season.  PARENTS BEWARE!!!  While the previous 5 seasons may have crossed over the line here & there as far as gruesomeness or satanic references go, THIS season blatantly leaps across it.  It is NOT for younger viewers, & even as an adult, I had some queeziness about the last couple of episodes. BTVS peaked with season 5.

777652,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000DANYD,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 9]","When I first watched the sixth season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; I pretty much took it for granted that this was the weakest season of Joss Whedon's creation (the second is still the best for me).  But as I watched it again on DVD I found that even if it is indeed a weak season by &quot;BtVS&quot; standards it still ends up being worth 5 stars.  The weakest Big Bads in the show's history give way in the final episodes to the biggest surprise Big Bad since Angeleus.  You have to get bonus points for not seeing that one coming (although you can clearly see how it was set up from the first episode when you watch it again).  Besides, just tally up the surprises that come at the end of the season, specifically in terms of what happens at Xander and Anya's wedding at the end of &quot;Hell's Bells,&quot; to Buffy at the end of &quot;Normal Again,&quot; to Tara at the end of &quot;Seeing Red,&quot; to Warren at the end of &quot;Villains,&quot; with Giles at the end of &quot;Two to Go,&quot; and with Dawn, Xander, and Spike at the end of &quot;Grave.&quot;&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Sixth Season&quot; is about leaving childish things behind and taking on responsibility in the adult world, which explains both why Buffy is working at the &quot;DoubleMeat Palace&quot; (the only &quot;BtVS&quot; episode to lose sponsors when fast food restaurants were offended) and why the Big Bads for the season are the Nerds (Flooded), who are still very much into playing with their toys.  The doctor (Michael Warren) in &quot;Normal Again&quot; is on target when he talks about how lame these guys are compared to the Master, the Mayor, and Glory, but they are the perfect flip side to the major themes of the season.  Xander and Anya have convinced themselves that they are ready for the next step and announce their engagement (&quot;Life Serial&quot;) while Buffy and begins a destructive intimate relationship with Spike (&quot;Smashed&quot; &amp; &quot;Wrecked&quot;) and Dawn is having major abandonment issues (&quot;Older and Far Away&quot;).With Anthony Stewart Head departing the cast it was nice to see Alyson Hannigan get the final spot in the credits, and I was looking forward to seeing Willow continue to build on the power and position she assumed at the end of the previous season.  She looks to be on track when she succeeds in bringing Buffy back from the dead in &quot;Bargaining, Part I,&quot; but Giles points out the danger (&quot;Flooded&quot;) and Willow uses magic to fix her relationship with Tara (&quot;All the Way&quot;).  When the couple break up (&quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;) Willow goes off the deep end and hits bottom (&quot;Smashed&quot;), which only sets up the tragic end game of the season.  As Willow treads the Wicca path to the dark side Buffy has to deal with the consequences of crawling out of her grave (&quot;Bargaining, Part 2&quot;) and finding herself living in hell on earth (&quot;After Life&quot;).When Buffy died at the end of the fifth season her tombstone reminded us that we &quot;she saved the world...a lot,&quot; and one of the biggest ironies of the sixth season is that this time somebody else gets to do it.  On the downside for the season it does have the weakest Halloween (&quot;All the Way&quot;) and Buffy birthday (&quot;Older and Far Away&quot;) episodes of all time, both of which deal with Dawn in her major whining period, but on the plus side we have the stellar musical episode &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot; courtesy of Joss Whedon and the prime comedic moments of Buffy trying to sell a mummy's paw at the Magic Box (&quot;Life Serial&quot;), Joan the Vampire Slayer (&quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;) and a fight between invisible people (&quot;Gone&quot;).  But overall things are clearly a lot darker this season, which is appropriate since it is not a lot of fun out there in the big bad world.  Joyce is dead, Giles has gone back to England, and Buffy and the Scoobies have to grow up, whether they want to or not.Overall, the two performers who stand out most for me in the cast for this season are Amber Benson and James Marsters.  Benson not only has memorable moments on her rollercoaster relationship with Willow, but similar scenes with Buffy and Dawn.  Marsters contiues to provide shadings on Spike's feelings for the Slayer, although often his moments with Dawn are the most real.  This is not to slight Sarah Michelle Gellar's acting because she is still one of the best weepers on television and her comic timing has improved tremendously.  However, notice at the end of the opening credits the final shot is not of Buffy but of the Buffy Bot.If I had any questions about what ranking to give this DVD the extras would certainly settle the issue.  On Disc 2 with &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot; there is an Academy of Television Arts and Sciences panel discussion featuring pretty much everybody (Gellar the notable no show), David Fury's video diary giving us a behind the scenes look at the musical, three &quot;karoke&quot; numbers that are really sing alongs (the original voices are still there) and there is also an Eager egg in the Subtitles menu for the musical.  On Disc 6 there is the excellent  30-minute &quot;Life is the Big Bad: Season Six Overview,&quot; a 43-minute television documentary &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer - Television with a Bite,&quot; and a few outtakes (Gellar avoids showing up here too).In terms of the commentary tracks Whedon shines as always on &quot;Once More with Feeling,&quot; and we get good efforts from Marti Noxon and David Fury on &quot;Bargaining&quot; and Drew Z. Greenberg on &quot;Smashed.&quot;  But Rick Rosenthal and Diego Gutierrez on &quot;Normal Again&quot; and James Conter and Fury on &quot;Grave&quot; tend to get caught up with watching, and David Soloman and Rebecca Rand Kirshner on &quot;Hell's Bells&quot; are too busy making jokes to offer much insight.",5,Buffy and the Scoobies learn the real world is very harsh,1086220800,"06 3,

Thank God it didn't! I expected that in UPN Buffy would try to continue the same line as in the others seasons but Joss Whedon dared to make a dark season, in which the slayer ressurected and entered in depression. I mean, which series has the main character in depression for one whole season?? only Buffy!! The show is so creative, deep, fun, cute, thrilling, emotional and sometimes too sad. Another thing is that the character development is outstanding and the story flows perfectly, never overrated.The most amazing in season six is that you never feel bored because this season is very dramatic and intense and you are in touch with the characters and actually feel for them. Many people  say that Buffy jumped the shark this season but I think that Joss Whedon wanted to innovate and he did it well turning the series more dramatic but always making satires. The best episodes are: Bargaining, Life Serial, the musical, Smashed, Wrecked, Normal Again and the 4 final episodes.In conclusion I'd like to register that Buffy is the best series ever done and there won't be another one as Buffy.",5,Impressive and really daring.. this is good television,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,1216,"['far', 'most', 'daring', 'season', 'Buffy', 'being', 'cancelled', 'WB', 'people', 'thought', 'series', 'would', 'end', 'Thank', 'God', 'did', ""n't"", 'expected', 'UPN', 'Buffy', 'would', 'try', 'continue', 'same', 'line', 'others', 'seasons', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'dared', 'make', 'dark', 'season', 'slayer', 'ressurected', 'entered', 'depression', 'mean', 'series', 'main', 'character', 'depression', 'one', 'whole', 'season', 'only', 'Buffy', 'show', 'so', 'creative', 'deep', 'fun', 'cute', 'thrilling', 'emotional', 'sometimes', 'too', 'sad', 'thing', 'character', 'development', 'outstanding', 'story', 'perfectly', 'never', 'most', 'amazing', 'season', 'six', 'never', 'feel', 'bored', 'season', 'very', 'dramatic', 'intense', 'are', 'touch', 'characters', 'actually', 'feel', 'Many', 'people', 'say', 'Buffy', 'jumped', 'shark', 'season', 'think', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'wanted', 'innovate', 'did', 'well', 'turning', 'series', 'more', 'dramatic', 'always', 'making', 'satires', 'best', 'episodes', 'are', 'Bargaining', 'Life', 'Serial', 'musical', 'Smashed', 'Wrecked', 'Normal', 'Again', '4', 'final', 'episodes.In', 'conclusion', ""'d"", 'like', 'register', 'Buffy', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'done', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'Buffy']",N/A

I still don't know what happened. Did Joss and his writers just run out of good ideas? Or did Joss, secure in the success of the show, feel free to indulge emotional issues he'd never been able to resolve?  Where is the joy in watching characters about whom you've learned to care sink lower and lower in their lives until they are perpetually miserable?

The 3 nerds, Jonathon, Warren and Andrew, just didn't interest me. It would be okay for an episode or two, but for an entire season? There are a few comedic moments, but it wasn't special to me. That to me was the lowpoint of the season. The high points - Spike & Buffy's sexscapades. It was an interesting plot twist. And the major highlight of the season is Willow's growth as a witch:One of the points being what can happen to a person when one comes into so much power as she did. If you haven't actually seen the season yet, like Jenny Calendar & Joyce Summers, I won't spoil the fact that a beloved character will die this season as well. Other things to look forward to: Riley returns for one episode. This is also the season with the Buffy musical ""Once more with Feeling"". And we also see the debut of the lovable and underrated demon, Clem. As for DVD features, you get bonus commentary on a few of the episodes, there's also a bonus feature of an hour long discussion panel about the series with Joss Whedon, Marti N., Spike, Dawn, Xander, Willow and a couple other behind the scenes guys. Also, if you missed it on tv, the commercial free A&E Biography of ""Buffy"" is also an additional feature.

While yes it was dark, it had to be, in order to be believable.  Buffy had just come back to earth, to having to fight the good fight again, after having died, went to heaven, and been released from all of that in the season 5 finale, &quot;The Gift&quot;.  We go through the season watching Buffy adapt back to the real world, struggle with things that most 20-somethings struggle with such as bills, money, employment problems, loneliness, emptiness, sorrow, friends with problems, and a dead end relationship with someone whom she knows she shouldn't be with.  Who hasn't been there?The season ends up with a twist when a beloved character is killed, thus turning Willow dark and evil, and out for blood, even if that blood is of her own best friend, Buffy.The nerd trio, while many despise them and I admit I did too at first, aren't too bad.  In fact they provide a lot of light moments in this otherwise dark and serious season of episodes.  Give them a chance, they might grow on you too!The end of the season brings Buffy back full circle.  Again she is crawling out of a grave, just as she did in the first episode of the season, but this time, she is coming out into a world of beauty, light, and new discoveries, all waiting to be shared with her sister Dawn, rather than the fire, darkness, and misery she came into from the grave the first time.  This full circle is a wonderful way to tie the season together and bring things to a close.The DVD's themselves are wonderful.  The box is the same as the other seasons, folding out with 6 discs, each with a different character on each of the discs.  Sound quality is superb and sounds wonderful on a surround sound stereo, and picture quality is the best of any of the DVD sets for Buffy I have seen to date.  Sharp and clear with no grain.  The menus are easy to navigate, while remaining attractive and in theme with the season.Inside of the season 6 set there are inserts in the side pocket that say the release for the final season, season 7 are due in stores on October of 2004.  This is much faster than the other seasons have been released, and this isn't a bad thing at all in my opinion.When all is said and done, this is a must own for any avid Buffy fan, or anyone who loves DVD's of the shows they enjoy.

777659,A2TVMOHHS0CF0T,B0000DANYD,L. Taylor,"[1, 1]","After having seen all 7 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I have to say that season 6 was a little disappointing, and I think most fans of the show will agree. Before I give my honest review, I feel just a little retrospective look at season 6 is needed.The storyline of season 6 begins with the scoobie-gang having to adjust to life without Buffy, until Willow becomes fearful that Buffy's death may not have been the end of her life, but that now her soul might be trapped in some terrible hell dimension like Angel's soul was trapped at the end of Season 2. Therefore Willow (and the rest of the gang) unable to accept this as a possibility for Buffy's fate decide it's time to bring her back to life. Willow and Tara decide to work the magical mojo with the help of Anya and Xander. In the end of Episode 2 Buffy is finally resurrected.As the storyline progresses through the season each member of the group must come to terms with his/her own feelings and personal problems. This is truly the ""Big bad"" of Season 6, even though the trio of Warren, Johnathan, and Andrew are also rivals Buffy and the scooby gang must deal with from time to time.Personally, I feel the storyline went to a few dark places that I wished it wouldn't have, and I felt the storyline was a bit self-pittying for all the scoobies. I also feel that the storyline between Buffy and Spike took a turn for the worse, not because they finally ended up sleeping together, but because it was simply so superficial and degrading. In the end, Buffy was only using Spike because she wanted to ""feel"" something......anything. Spike of course was in it not only for the sex, but because he actually cared about Buffy. This was somewhat harsh to swallow though because of the way we watched her treat him in return.For those of you who feel Spike was only evil before he got his soul back, and that he never cared about Buffy, I will simply remind you of how Spike chose to suffer extreme torture at Glory's hands rather than giving up Dawn due to fear of how it would hurt Buffy. If he didn't care, he wouldn't of done that.I also feel that the witchcraft addiction for Willow went a little too far, and it seemed like it was very similar to a drug addiction rather than an addiction to magic. I don't know if this was Joss's idea to include this in the script, or someone elses, but I think this was a bit of a dark turn for Willow's character. I remember that Joss and the crew stated that when they first began the series they decided to use monsters and supernatural termoil as a way to parallel the pressures of life for teens in high school within the series so that the fans could ""relate"" to the problems the scooby's faced in some way. I don't know if this is what they were trying to accomplish with Willow's magic addiction or not, but I think it was a bit of a bad move, and probably appealed to the wrong audience. The only positive note I can say about it is when Willow lost control, and the magic took her over we got to see some real serious action that gave the series a little flavor.As for Xander and Anya's relationship going out the window, well, thats life, and stuff like that actually happens. I feel the selfish side of both characters was revealed, and although it wasn't the highlight of the season for me, still, it was a nice touch.Personally, I feel the biggest highlight of the season was at the very end of the season when Spike got his soul back. Many fans have stated they foreseen this comming, and sure enough, they were correct. Joss has stated that they intended for Spike to get his soul back from the very start of Season 6, and they hinted at this the whole time through the season, such as when Xander stated ""You let that souless thing touch you"", or the numerous times Buffy ridiculed him for not having a soul. Spike's having recieved his soul again played an important role in the final Season of Buffy, and even continued to play an important part of the final Season of Angel (Season 5). Thus, I think Spike getting his soul back was a great idea.In conclusion, I feel that Season 6 was good, but it had quite a few episodes and scenes that I could live without seeing again. I gave Season 6 4 stars, and it only recieves that high of a rating because of the few good points to the season, such as Big Bad Willow, Spike getting his soul Back, Buffy comming back from the dead, and how well the events of Season 6 set the stage for the start of Season 7, which was a better season than Season 6 in my honest opinion.",4,Season 6,1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,4536,"['having', 'seen', '7', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'have', 'say', 'season', '6', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'think', 'most', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'agree', 'give', 'honest', 'review', 'feel', 'just', 'little', 'retrospective', 'look', 'season', '6', 'needed.The', 'storyline', 'season', '6', 'begins', 'scoobie-gang', 'having', 'adjust', 'life', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'fearful', 'Buffy', 'death', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'life', 'now', 'soul', 'might', 'be', 'trapped', 'terrible', 'hell', 'dimension', 'Angel', 'soul', 'was', 'trapped', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'Therefore', 'Willow', 'rest', 'gang', 'unable', 'accept', 'possibility', 'Buffy', 'fate', 'time', 'bring', 'back', 'life', 'Willow', 'Tara', 'decide', 'work', 'magical', 'mojo', 'help', 'Anya', 'Xander', 'end', 'Episode', '2', 'Buffy', 'finally', 'resurrected.As', 'storyline', 'season', 'member', 'group', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'his/her', 'own', 'feelings', 'personal', 'problems', 'truly', 'Big', 'bad', 'Season', '6', 'even', 'trio', 'Warren', 'Johnathan', 'Andrew', 'are', 'also', 'rivals', 'Buffy', 'scooby', 'gang', 'must', 'deal', 'time', 'time.Personally', 'feel', 'storyline', 'went', 'few', 'dark', 'places', 'wished', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'felt', 'storyline', 'was', 'bit', 'self-pittying', 'scoobies', 'also', 'feel', 'storyline', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'took', 'turn', 'worse', 'not', 'finally', 'ended', 'up', 'sleeping', 'together', 'was', 'simply', 'so', 'superficial', 'degrading', 'end', 'Buffy', 'was', 'only', 'using', 'Spike', 'wanted', 'feel', 'something', 'anything', 'Spike', 'course', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'sex', 'actually', 'cared', 'Buffy', 'was', 'somewhat', 'harsh', 'swallow', 'way', 'watched', 'treat', 'return.For', 'who', 'feel', 'Spike', 'was', 'only', 'evil', 'got', 'soul', 'back', 'never', 'cared', 'Buffy', 'will', 'simply', 'remind', 'how', 'Spike', 'chose', 'suffer', 'extreme', 'torture', 'Glory', 'hands', 'rather', 'giving', 'up', 'Dawn', 'due', 'fear', 'how', 'would', 'hurt', 'Buffy', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'would', ""n't"", 'done', 'that.I', 'also', 'feel', 'witchcraft', 'addiction', 'Willow', 'went', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'seemed', 'was', 'very', 'similar', 'drug', 'addiction', 'rather', 'addiction', 'magic', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Joss', 'idea', 'include', 'script', 'someone', 'elses', 'think', 'was', 'bit', 'dark', 'turn', 'Willow', 'character', 'remember', 'Joss', 'crew', 'stated', 'when', 'first', 'began', 'series', 'decided', 'use', 'monsters', 'supernatural', 'termoil', 'way', 'parallel', 'pressures', 'life', 'teens', 'high', 'school', 'series', 'fans', 'could', 'relate', 'problems', 'scooby', 'faced', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'Willow', 'magic', 'addiction', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'bit', 'bad', 'move', 'probably', 'appealed', 'wrong', 'audience', 'only', 'positive', 'note', 'can', 'say', 'when', 'Willow', 'lost', 'control', 'magic', 'took', 'got', 'see', 'real', 'serious', 'action', 'gave', 'series', 'little', 'flavor.As', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'relationship', 'going', 'out', 'window', 'well', 'thats', 'life', 'stuff', 'actually', 'feel', 'selfish', 'side', 'characters', 'was', 'revealed', 'was', ""n't"", 'highlight', 'season', 'still', 'was', 'nice', 'touch.Personally', 'feel', 'biggest', 'highlight', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'end', 'season', 'when', 'Spike', 'got', 'soul', 'back', 'Many', 'fans', 'have', 'stated', 'foreseen', 'comming', 'sure', 'enough', 'were', 'correct', 'Joss', 'stated', 'intended', 'Spike', 'get', 'soul', 'back', 'very', 'start', 'Season', '6', 'hinted', 'whole', 'time', 'season', 'such', 'when', 'Xander', 'stated', 'let', 'souless', 'thing', 'touch', 'numerous', 'times', 'Buffy', 'ridiculed', 'not', 'having', 'soul', 'Spike', 'having', 'recieved', 'soul', 'again', 'played', 'important', 'role', 'final', 'Season', 'Buffy', 'even', 'continued', 'play', 'important', 'part', 'final', 'Season', 'Angel', 'Season', '5', 'Thus', 'think', 'getting', 'soul', 'back', 'was', 'great', 'idea.In', 'conclusion', 'feel', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'good', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', 'scenes', 'could', 'live', 'seeing', 'again', 'gave', 'Season', '6', '4', 'stars', 'only', 'high', 'rating', 'few', 'good', 'points', 'season', 'such', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Willow', 'Spike', 'getting', 'soul', 'Back', 'Buffy', 'comming', 'back', 'dead', 'how', 'well', 'events', 'Season', '6', 'set', 'stage', 'start', 'Season', '7', 'was', 'better', 'season', 'Season', '6', 'honest', 'opinion']",N/A

777661,A1WBRD0IDA97MS,B0000DANYD,"M0rr1gan ""merseian""","[3, 12]","Season six of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" starts to show the problems which too many successful shows do after their best seasons have aired.  Just as the X-Files fell apart after season four and Friends was never really the same after the fifth season (when Ross almost married Emily), Buffy the Vampire Slayer began a slow decline after the best of its seven seasons, the third.Bear in mind that Buffy is usually absolutely top shelf material.  A bad episode of Buffy is still a lot betetr than the best episodes of many other series, but you could see that the creative staff had done their best work in season three, and, despite innovations like ""Hush"" and ""Once More...With Feling"", a steady decline had set in.  Season five saw the character of Buffy Summers become actively unlikable, and, while she is marginally more pleasant in season six, there was very little else to recommend those episodes.I think that's the essential flaw of both the fifth and sixth seasons, but especially the latter.  Other story arcs always had something special to offer the viewer, to make even a bad episode, few that there were, watchable.  There were exciting characters, interesting villains, or odd situations to maintain one's interest.Not so with the fifth and sixth season.Well, scratch that.  Season five had Glory, who was attractive and interesting, if mono-dimensional, but season six had nothing of the sort.Killer nerds for villains?Come now.  We've had arch-vampires (two of 'em, actually), would-be demons, rogue slayers, hell-gods, and even the ultimate Frankenstein.  To think that the three losers from season six are even fit to polish Adam or the Master's boots is just silly.I digress.Season six moved BtVS from a supernatural adventure series to a sort of low-wattage prime-time soap opera, and neither characters nor writers are suited for that sort of thing.",3,Oh oh...nearing the end!!,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1872,"['Season', 'six', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'show', 'problems', 'too', 'many', 'successful', 'shows', 'do', 'best', 'seasons', 'have', 'aired', 'Just', 'X-Files', 'fell', 'apart', 'season', 'four', 'Friends', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'same', 'fifth', 'season', 'when', 'Ross', 'almost', 'married', 'Emily', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'began', 'slow', 'decline', 'best', 'seven', 'seasons', 'third.Bear', 'mind', 'Buffy', 'usually', 'absolutely', 'top', 'shelf', 'material', 'bad', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'still', 'lot', 'betetr', 'best', 'episodes', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'could', 'see', 'creative', 'staff', 'had', 'done', 'best', 'work', 'season', 'three', 'innovations', 'Hush', 'Once', 'More', 'Feling', 'steady', 'decline', 'had', 'set', 'Season', 'five', 'saw', 'character', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'become', 'actively', 'unlikable', 'marginally', 'more', 'pleasant', 'season', 'six', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'else', 'recommend', 'episodes.I', 'think', 'essential', 'flaw', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'seasons', 'especially', 'latter', 'Other', 'story', 'arcs', 'always', 'had', 'something', 'special', 'offer', 'viewer', 'make', 'even', 'bad', 'episode', 'few', 'were', 'watchable', 'were', 'exciting', 'characters', 'interesting', 'villains', 'odd', 'situations', 'maintain', 'one', 'interest.Not', 'so', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'season.Well', 'scratch', 'Season', 'five', 'had', 'Glory', 'who', 'was', 'attractive', 'interesting', 'mono-dimensional', 'season', 'six', 'had', 'nothing', 'sort.Killer', 'nerds', 'villains', 'Come', 'now', ""'ve"", 'had', 'arch-vampires', 'two', ""'em"", 'actually', 'would-be', 'demons', 'rogue', 'slayers', 'hell-gods', 'even', 'ultimate', 'Frankenstein', 'think', 'three', 'losers', 'season', 'six', 'are', 'even', 'fit', 'polish', 'Adam', 'Master', 'boots', 'just', 'silly.I', 'digress.Season', 'six', 'moved', 'BtVS', 'supernatural', 'adventure', 'series', 'sort', 'low-wattage', 'prime-time', 'soap', 'opera', 'characters', 'writers', 'are', 'suited', 'sort', 'thing']",N/A

777663,A2SMHYSKPQP56O,B0000DANYD,"Marcus Bailey ""Marc 'grailwolf' Bailey""","[5, 6]","It is true that this season is far darker, as a whole, than any other period in the run of the show.  More, the series does seem to flounder somewhat, as if searching for a direction.My contention, however, is that this foundering is exactly the point that the creators were trying to make.  Each season of Buffy has revolved around a particular theme (generally tied in with the period of life the characters are going through).  The theme for this season was described by the creators as ""Oh, grow up.""  The Scooby gang has put High School far behind them and now need to forge their path ahead into adulthood.  The sense of a lack of focus at this time is probably familiar to the vast majority of us who have made it past our mid-twenties.  In short, the Scoobies need to figure out what they want to be when they grow up.  This is not always fun to watch, but it arguably does more to develop the characters than any other situation the gang has faced.One note: the amazing musical episode, `Once More, With Feeling' was only aired once in its entirety (it ran over by 8 minutes in the inital airing and only the edited version has been shown since).  This DVD marks the first time that people who missed the 11/6/01 airing will be able to see the whole episode.I hate to give away plot points, so I won't go into specifics.  However, the final four episodes of the season are among the most disturbing of any show I've ever watched.  To fully appreciate this, you should have seen the five preceding seasons, and I heartily recommend that you do.  The final two episodes, in particular, are amazing.  They were shown back-to-back when they first aired, and this is a good way to watch them.  Without giving anything away, let me say that something happens near the middle of these two hours that brought literal cheers to my household.  One of those moments that makes the darkness of the preceeding hours more worthwhile.In summary, while this may not always be the most pleasant season of Buffy to watch, it is one of the most important.  If you enjoy the tearjerker episodes, you should be quite happy with many of these.  But through it all the humor is never completely lost, and when the dust settles we are left with a feeling of hope for the future of these amazing characters.",5,It was the best of times...,1084233600,"05 11, 2004",2004,2291,"['true', 'season', 'far', 'darker', 'whole', 'other', 'period', 'run', 'show', 'More', 'series', 'seem', 'flounder', 'somewhat', 'searching', 'direction.My', 'contention', 'however', 'foundering', 'exactly', 'point', 'creators', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'season', 'Buffy', 'revolved', 'particular', 'theme', 'generally', 'tied', 'period', 'life', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'theme', 'season', 'was', 'described', 'creators', 'Oh', 'grow', 'up', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'put', 'High', 'School', 'far', 'now', 'need', 'forge', 'path', 'ahead', 'adulthood', 'sense', 'lack', 'focus', 'time', 'probably', 'familiar', 'vast', 'majority', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'mid-twenties', 'short', 'Scoobies', 'need', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'when', 'grow', 'up', 'not', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'arguably', 'more', 'develop', 'characters', 'other', 'situation', 'gang', 'faced.One', 'note', 'amazing', 'musical', 'episode', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'was', 'only', 'aired', 'once', 'entirety', 'ran', 'over', '8', 'minutes', 'inital', 'airing', 'only', 'edited', 'version', 'been', 'shown', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'people', 'who', 'missed', '11/6/01', 'airing', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'whole', 'episode.I', 'hate', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'points', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'specifics', 'However', 'final', 'four', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'most', 'disturbing', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'five', 'preceding', 'seasons', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'do', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'particular', 'are', 'amazing', 'were', 'shown', 'back-to-back', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'good', 'way', 'watch', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'let', 'say', 'something', 'happens', 'middle', 'two', 'hours', 'brought', 'literal', 'cheers', 'household', 'One', 'moments', 'darkness', 'preceeding', 'hours', 'more', 'worthwhile.In', 'summary', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'most', 'pleasant', 'season', 'Buffy', 'watch', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'enjoy', 'tearjerker', 'should', 'be', 'quite', 'happy', 'many', 'humor', 'never', 'completely', 'lost', 'when', 'dust', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'hope', 'future', 'amazing', 'characters']",N/A

After Buffy left the WB, I didn't have cable, so I couldn't catch it on the UPN station.  I had to wait until the DVD release to see what happened in Season Six.This season hits the viewer a little hard; especially watching the episodes in rapid sequence on DVD (rather than having the week break between episodes on TV).  I felt that Season Five ended very well, and almost felt as though it could have been a series ending.  However, there was no &quot;happily ever after&quot; for our characters; and season Six shows us what happens after &quot;the final battle to save the world&quot; and the consequence of the personal sacrifices made to win that battle.  Our team has been through terrible trials, but life kept moving.  Regardless of what they've done to save the world, they still have to be able to deal with every day problems (like relationships, paying rent, etc.).Just like life, sometimes when you think the most awful thing has just happened, something worse always seems to follow it.  That seems to be the theme of this season.  Summed up poignantly in one of the last episodes, when reality unexpectedly comes tearing into this world of demons and magic and slams the viewer in the chest with a real shock.  I found many of the episodes this season to be very moving.  The episodes about addiction hit very close to home, because one of my best friends was struggling with an addiction problem at the time I was watching these DVDs.  The episodes dealing with  responsibility being forced on to a character who was finding it hard to deal with growing, brought me back to my college years struggling to stay awake in class and study during the day while cleaning dishes at a terrible restaurant at night.There is no Glory, Evil Angel, Spike and Dru, or Government Conspiracy this time around. The Season Six enemy is the self.  The struggle is with the characters realizing who they really are, and who they want to be.  It's a very introspective story.  No one changes of their own volition.  They are forced to change through circumstance.  It's a very interesting season, as far as a dramatic exercise and character exploration.  It is so dark that I can't see myself watching it over and over; yet, it is one of my favorite seasons.Don't worry, there are a lot of monsters, magic, and fighting this season as well...",5,"Great, Dark Season (&quot;No Spoilers&quot; Review)",1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,2407,"['Season', 'Six', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'Buffy', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'TV', 'Buffy', 'left', 'WB', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'could', ""n't"", 'catch', 'UPN', 'station', 'had', 'wait', 'DVD', 'release', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'Season', 'Six.This', 'season', 'viewer', 'little', 'hard', 'especially', 'watching', 'episodes', 'rapid', 'sequence', 'DVD', 'rather', 'having', 'week', 'break', 'episodes', 'TV', 'felt', 'Season', 'Five', 'ended', 'very', 'well', 'almost', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'series', 'ending', 'However', 'was', 'quot', 'happily', 'ever', 'quot', 'characters', 'season', 'Six', 'what', 'quot', 'final', 'battle', 'save', 'world', 'quot', 'consequence', 'personal', 'sacrifices', 'made', 'win', 'battle', 'team', 'been', 'terrible', 'trials', 'life', 'kept', 'moving', 'Regardless', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'save', 'world', 'still', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'deal', 'day', 'problems', 'relationships', 'paying', 'rent', 'etc', '.Just', 'life', 'sometimes', 'when', 'think', 'most', 'awful', 'thing', 'just', 'happened', 'something', 'worse', 'always', 'follow', 'be', 'theme', 'season', 'Summed', 'up', 'poignantly', 'one', 'last', 'episodes', 'when', 'reality', 'unexpectedly', 'tearing', 'world', 'demons', 'magic', 'viewer', 'chest', 'real', 'shock', 'found', 'many', 'episodes', 'season', 'be', 'very', 'moving', 'episodes', 'addiction', 'hit', 'very', 'close', 'home', 'one', 'best', 'friends', 'was', 'struggling', 'addiction', 'problem', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'episodes', 'dealing', 'responsibility', 'being', 'forced', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'finding', 'hard', 'deal', 'growing', 'brought', 'back', 'college', 'years', 'struggling', 'stay', 'awake', 'class', 'study', 'day', 'cleaning', 'dishes', 'terrible', 'restaurant', 'night.There', 'Glory', 'Evil', 'Angel', 'Spike', 'Dru', 'Government', 'Conspiracy', 'time', 'around', 'Season', 'Six', 'enemy', 'self', 'struggle', 'characters', 'realizing', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'very', 'introspective', 'story', 'one', 'changes', 'own', 'volition', 'are', 'forced', 'change', 'circumstance', 'very', 'interesting', 'season', 'as', 'far', 'dramatic', 'exercise', 'character', 'exploration', 'so', 'dark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'watching', 'yet', 'one', 'favorite', 'seasons.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'are', 'lot', 'monsters', 'magic', 'fighting', 'season', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The darker the better as far as I am concerned and that's what makes the spin-off Angel so rich, but with Joss Whedon off doing other projects the creativity here suffers in a big way.Buffy comes back from the dead and she mopes the rest of the year, has a abusive relationship with once evil Spike and (gasp) works at  fast food restaurant. Willow starts to go down the dark road of black magic and instead of treating it as a compulsion  to use magic as a crutch the writers treat it as a drug addiction metaphor  (oh brother). Let's see, what else, Dawn whines all year as they can't figure out what to do with her after her plot revelation of last season, we get more doomed relationships  (nobody lives happily ever after in the Buffy verse) and the presence of Giles is sorely missed as he is gone for most of the season.  The worst part, we get crappy sub par villains that aren't funny or the least bit entertaining that we are stuck watching all season.  The only highlight of the season is the Musical which is amazing and the only reason I give this season 3 stars instead of 2.Joss should have either left the show in more capable hands or finished while he was ahead with season 5.

It's no surprise, really: five years is generally the point at which a show starts to show signs of exhaustion, and while season five was a definite thumbs-up, there were a a number of sure signs of trouble to come:1) Dawn. Adding a &quot;baby&quot; to a family is an old sitcom device to shake things up. It worked because of the clever writing and, obviously, Michelle Trachtenberg.2) Glory. Upping the ante in the villain department every season is a good idea, but how do you top a God?3) Spike. Changing a character's basic nature from evil to good (or good to evil) is an old soap-opera trick (&quot;What, he's good now?&quot;)4) Buffy. She died. Again. Since death is the ultimate sanction, undoing it takes the finality of death away, and stops us from caring if future characters are killed, because they can always be brought back.Season Six dealt with the problem of topping Glory by going the opposite route, and creating the Triad, three hapless nerds who in no way were worthy successors to the Master, Angelus, bad Spike &amp; Dru, evil Faith, etc. It was often hilarious, but not really strong enough of an idea to sustain over a whole season. The Triad would have made a very funny three story arc, but beyond that, their limitations were obvious.It also made the fundamental mistake of pushing suspension of disbelief right over a cliff (that shark-headed gangster demon boss was just the worst idea in history....what were they thinking?). Also of betraying some signs of insecurity about the things they had done in season five and in six as well, and then trying to cover it up with clever humor, such as when the shrink tells Buffy that the retro-active addition of a sister (Dawn) into her alredy established family is a &quot;ridiculous plot device&quot; or that the Triad were &quot;pathetic&quot; villains. Tongue-in-cheek is one thing, farce is another. The episode where they allude that Buffy is in fact in a mental institution and everything you have seen in the previous 100 episodes is nothing more than the fever dreams of a schizo nut case is the classic &quot;Bobby Ewing&quot; mistake....&quot;That last season? It was only a dream!&quot; This was just insulting to the audience.I also felt the middle episodes suffered badly from the absence of Giles and from an overdose of Spike. Sometimes the best thing you can do with a great actor/character is hold him back a little bit, so as to leave the audience hungry. Spike is a great character and James Marsters a great actor, but sometimes less is more.This is not to say there were not some truly good moments in the season, such as Riley showing back up (didn't realize I liked this character until he left) the crotchey old Doublemeat Palace demon (&quot;You may want to flail your limbs while you still have time&quot;), the musical episode, the capricious and  brutally violent way that Tara is killed off, or the fact that ordinary Xander finally got to save the world when all the super-powered people failed. But overall, season six left me feeling a bit like Buffy after her ressurection: down, disappointed, and ungrateful.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[0, 0]","20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment has now released BUFFY, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, Season Six, onto DVD in a 6-disc/22-episode boxed set.Though series creator Joss Whedon's special brand of humor is still present, this season's episodes have a much darker edge to them than shows in previous seasons.  Indeed, this is certainly the most compelling BUFFY season thus far.The stand-out episode is, without question, ""Once More, With Feeling,"" a delightful one-hour Broadway-style musical in which the entire cast either sings or dances.  Then, there's ""Normal Again,"" which places Buffy in an alternate reality.  It's a great premise which, in this writer's opinion, should have been the basis for the series finale.Since Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) ""died"" at the end of Season Five, the initial episodes of this season deal with her resurrection, courtesy of a black magic spell cast by best friend Willow (Alyson Hannigan).Buffy's back, but there's something different about her.  It's so different that she even begins a torrid affair with nasty, albeit psychologically neutered, vampire Spike (James Marsters).  Additionally, Buffy is forced by a lack of finances to get a low level job and also has to deal with the fact that that sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), has become a shoplifter.Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and his former-demon girl friend, Anya (Emma Caulfield) continue their romance to a heart-breaking climax in the ""Hell's Bells"" episode, and Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) spends much of the season back in England.The chief villains this season are three geeks who have caused Buffy problems in previous seasons and have now decided to become the crime lords of Sunnydale.  Sadly, their moronic schemes result in multiple tragedies, causing a grief-stricken Willow to try to destroy the world via black magic.Among the many DVD extras is the A&E; series overview.

Though Dawn is an essential ""key"" to his show, I really thought she was getting more annoying this season. Nicholas Brendon is chunkier then ever but the more the fluff the more the loveable and Alyson Hannigan with that memorable black hair at the end is simple gorgeos.

This season is devided into two halves, with Giles, without Giles. Giles decided that Buffy was to depended on him so he does what he's been threathing to do since season 4, Go back to England. Everyone is going through thier own personal problems. Buffy was pulled out of Heaven by Williow and some very confussed and reluncted ""scobbies"". The whole season is then her dealing with this trumantic event. She enters into a odd sexual relationship with Spike, she start working at a hamburger place, and she is almost depressed at times. Xander and Anya actually make it to their wedding day(which, I was shocked at, being a Joss fan...no couple is ever happy for long) But of course Xander get cold feet and tell Anya the old ""it's not you, it's me"" right before they are going to marry. Dawn...wow, what a brat she is in this season. If I was Buffy, I would have summon Glory and gave to her. Buffy is now motherless, just coming back from the dead, her friends are going nuts and she out stealing stuff to get attention. Grow up, litte girl. Spike is very confussed as to what he wants to be and how much he willing to give up for Buffy and her love. Spike wants to be good, but he also wants to be bad. He sleeps with a very confussed and lifeless Buffy, hoping that she will love him back. When, she stops sleeping with during the middle of the season, he gets angry and does some stuff to try to forget and even hurt Buffy. Heres comes the sleeping with Anya and the attemped rape. I am Buffy and Spike fan, but ""seeing red"" is a VERY hard esp. to get through. It all boils down to Spike going to africa to get back his soul. On to the star of the seaon ""crazy Williow"" and Tara. The first esp. Williow kills a baby deer to get something she need to bring Buffy back, and she doesn't even loss sleep over it. This is the first clue that Williow is going to become additive to magic. It almost like someone one on drugs, its a lot of...""I swear, I quit tommrow."" Tara, who I think is the only normal one this season starts to see this, and leave Williow. After almost getting Dawn killed, Buffy tells her to get help of leave. Williow quits cold turkey and even back together with Tara. The three dorks(jonthan, andrew and warren) try to become ""supervillians"" and it all leads down to Tara and Buffy getting shot at by Warren. Guess which one dies,...you guessed it Tara. Poor Tara is left dead on the floor while Williow goes nuts. This sends Willow completely over the edge and not only does she go after Warren, but also her friends and ANYONE who come into her path. This seaon lost of lot of the humor which is what I liked about Buffy. Also, I really missed Giles when he was gone. When Giles leave, the show really gets dark because know one can tell them that this is wrong. It a good season, just really dark.

After I watched it again though, I realized that this dark and poetic season is the actually the most profound and the closest to life. It is by far the darkest season and a far cry from season 1, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Consider also that it has several of ""the bests"" in the whole series: the best episode ""Once More with Feeling"", the best ending to a cliffhanger (resurrecting Buffy from the dead...of COURSE she would have to claw her way out of a grave at some point), the BEST VILLAINS (Yes, that's right, I said the BEST....the 3 Geeks were the smartest, funniest and most interesting of all the villains...in a sense they were the scariest because they are much closer to us than a Hell God, a mutant demon/human, or an immortal mayor...plus they had the DEATH STAR ON THEIR VAN!), and the best evil Willow (WAY better than the ""BORED now"" Willow from Anya's alternate dimension)...so to all the ""Buffy purists"" that hate season 6...I think it's because you DON'T REALLY GET BUFFY.  You are the ""American Psycho 2"" to the original ""American Psycho""...you think you're watching a slasher flick but really it's a brilliant societal commentary.

777674,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0000DANYD,Mitch Weaver,"[3, 5]","By the time season five ended, we had witnessed the second best season of the entire show. With Buffy dead, and the show moving to a new network, the skepticism definately began to settle in for the future of the show. However, even though Buffy may have died at the end of the previous season, the momentum of the show was still very much alive. Season 6 moves at a different pace than the previous seasons because it relies on the characters to bring themselves down, and less on a major villan like Angelus, The Mayor, or Glory. This is perhaps what made season 6 feel like such a refreshing change of pace.The sixth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a much darker season however. You see everything from Spike and Buffy in a violent relationship to Willow turning evil. But, there are some light hearted elements that manage to break some of the overall tension like the geeky group called ""The Trio"" which make it their mission to take care of Buffy using ""brains over braun"". The group is made up ofWarren - who created the Buffy bot in season 5, Johnathan - who was the nerd of focus while the show was in high school, and a newcomer more nerdy than both of them put together named Andrew (whose sexual preference is in constant question throughout the show).The third and fifth seasons may have been better overall, but season 6 is highly underrated and extremely enjoyable in my opinion. The episode that has gained the most attention is ""Once More with Feeling"" which is basically a musical with some dialogue mixed in. All the actors did a good job and supplied their own voices for the episode. What amazed me was the fact that everyone from Sarah Michelle Gellar to James Marsters can actually sing. Other episodes worth mentioning are ""Normal Again"" , ""Tabula Rusa"", ""Seeing Red"", and the final three episodes - ""Villans"", ""Two to Go"", and ""Grave"" which brought season 6 to an extremely satisfying close.Overall, the sixth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is definately worth watching and one of the more enjoyable seasons of the show. The DVD set for season 6 is great as well. My favorite aspect was the in-depth featurette ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer : Television with a Bite"" from A&E.; Tons of great information about the whole show.

There are whole strings of episodes which fully blow. Some of the worst Buffy hours are here in the this season, and it's a little...but only minimally and at it's worst temporarily...disappointing. There are shows that are so joyless, so dark, so depressing...yes it may be ""art"", it may be ""real"" but it was also no fun.You will find yourself saying ""what happened to the funny?"" The resurrection of Buffy...heck, the whole first half year...is just tough on a Buffy fan.Except...and it is these sort of thoughts which elevate this season to miraculous heights...when you least expect it, Whedon and company throw you a big ol' Bugs Bunny curve. The first one being the musical episode. Dear God in heaven, in the midst of a sour beginning to a painful season, there is this soaring piece of work that will, in my usual hyperbolic manner, lift your soul.Yeah yeah yeah. You'll laugh, you'll cry...whatever. You will.Again, like so many single episodes of this amazing series, it stands out as one of the best hours of television. Ever. No hyperbole there. Fact. Put this, and ""Hush"", and maybe a half dozen other episodes against anything you've ever seen on the small screen, and they hold up.After a agonizing mid-season quality lull (but being honest, hardly ever really boring...), the conclusion to the year...the last four or five hours...are transcendant.Xander & Anya's courtship continues towards the standard TV-series wedding-day episode that is acutely observant in certain domestic issues you hadn't yet seen on ""Buffy"". And Nicholas Brendon does an exemplary job here.Willow's magic-as-drug addiction/recovery plotline does wear thin, and is a little too obvious, yet her ""Dark Phoenix"" conversion still remains chilling. Viewers have grown to love Willow, and seeing this beyond-evil manifestation makes you wish out loud she doesn't succumb to her ""dark side.""Dawn's a bit weak this year. But I didn't find her as non-intentionally irritating as some other reviewers out there, if that means anything.I loved the three nerd villains, but probably only because I understood WAY too many of their in-jokes.The whole Buffy/Spike thing left me cold for most of the year. I didn't ""see"" it. I didn't ""feel"" it, I guess.It felt a little forced...but when it reaches that violent twist in her bathroom, I was seriously disturbed. Maybe I DID feel it...hmmm.Rest assured, the creators still have a way of shocking and surprising even the most jaded and experienced viewers. Twice in the last three episodes (the last during the final millisecond of the entire season) I was utterly shocked...flabbergasted...blown out of my chair.Once, I even stood up and said out loud to my television set, ""No WAY!""But, as you may imagine, I put an expletive between those two words.I was masterfully led in one direction, and found myself in a place I didn't expect, yet it made perfect sense.I willingly lose sleep to watch this show.

Leister,"[5, 7]","Worst season of Buffy ever.The Buffy/Spike relationship was good, but instead of making about Buffy's darkness, they suddenly put an abusive spin on it.  Why can only Faith and Willow have their darkness explored?  Buffy should have come back as ""other"", but instead she came back more depressed than before her death. Who wouldn't with demanding friends, a whiny sister you have to take care of and a watcher who spent years telling you how to run your life who now says you're on your own?I felt like Buffy was hidden in plain sight this year.  Maybe SMG didn't want to do the show anymore, maybe the writers were tired of Buffy, but I felt like they only brought her out to kick her and then gave everything to Willow.  And I could not stand Willow this season.  The pat line is to accuse those who say Willow sucked this year as being anti-gay, but honestly I hated the scenes of her ""drunken"" magic use, I found them annoying and I hated her self-righteous speeches to Buffy regardless of her sexual orientation.  I hated that she never apologized for taking Buffy out of heaven and that they made Willow first the hero of the show (she saved Buffy at that fast food place) and then the villain so that it was basically:  Willow the Witch instead of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Was Willow a better villain than the geek triad at the start?

777677,A28504V9WK2V1F,B0000DANYD,mollie1913,"[3, 4]","Its difficult to judge this season of Buffy. After all it had all the hallmarks of being one of the best. There was multiple main character deaths, plenty of original storylines, an interesting villian. It really had promise. And yet...it didnt quite hit the mark.For some reason the soul seemed to vanish with this season. This may have been intentional on the creators part, but for some reason this viewer was left a little cold.For starters the character of Buffy became even more unlikeable for me. Her death brought about a kind of vacuousness that was only ever so slightly present before. Xander, once a wonderful and funny character, began his slow descent into nothingness. Dawn continued her pointless presence. And Willows so called increased power just seemed rushed and out of place(though admittedly quite cool towards the end).The one saving grace for me, as it has always been, is Spike. His character has always remained fresh and interesting. Even in this season where he endures countless acts of humilation at the hand of a very heartless Buffy, Spike retains his dignity. (This is disregarding the episode of ""Seeing Red"", which I have since learned was nothing but a last minute ploy to get Spikes character out of Sunnydale and into a new soul.)Of course this season had its highlights. ""Once More With Feeling"" is an amazing triumph. The songs are wonderful and brilliantly sung by the cast. I enjoyed Amber Bensons contribution most of all. I also like ""Wrecked"" and ""Smashed"" if only for the gratuitous nudity of a certain Mr. James Marsters;-}""The Body"" has a kind of eery powerful charm that leaves the viewer very unsettled. And the final two episodes are memorable, particulary for the dialogue between Willow and Buffy before their big showdown. Plus I did enjoy most of the early Nerds scenes. Andrew and Jonathan retained a kind of warped sweetness even when trying to be ""Crimelords"", that made you feel very conflicted over whether you should care what happened to them.I suppose this season seems like such a departure from the others because of the fact that the emotions of the characters achieve dominance over the action for a change. This results in an entirely different tone to the previous seasons. There is a disjointed structure in the narrative for example. One episode would deal with something important and then the next would disregard it completely. Our main villians are infact nothing more than red herrings and we lose the important characters of Joyce and Tara. The viewer suffers a lot of changes and upheavals, and unfortunately it doesnt really pay off. Not to say that all stories should have a happy ending but after such an amount of grinding misery it would help a little.Even dispite its change of pace and noticible lack of humour, season six maintains a certain level of distinction for experimenting with an already winning formula. It is quite fearless in taking these well established characters and situations down an new and much darker road and for that it should be given credit.",3,Middle of the road,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,3053,"['difficult', 'judge', 'season', 'Buffy', 'had', 'hallmarks', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'was', 'multiple', 'main', 'character', 'deaths', 'plenty', 'original', 'storylines', 'interesting', 'villian', 'really', 'had', 'promise', 'yet', 'quite', 'hit', 'mark.For', 'reason', 'soul', 'seemed', 'vanish', 'season', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intentional', 'creators', 'part', 'reason', 'viewer', 'was', 'left', 'little', 'cold.For', 'character', 'Buffy', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'unlikeable', 'death', 'brought', 'kind', 'vacuousness', 'was', 'only', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'present', 'before', 'Xander', 'once', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'character', 'began', 'slow', 'descent', 'nothingness', 'Dawn', 'continued', 'pointless', 'presence', 'Willows', 'so', 'called', 'increased', 'power', 'just', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'place', 'admittedly', 'quite', 'cool', 'end', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'always', 'been', 'Spike', 'character', 'always', 'remained', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'Even', 'season', 'where', 'countless', 'acts', 'humilation', 'hand', 'very', 'heartless', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'dignity', 'disregarding', 'episode', 'Seeing', 'Red', 'have', 'learned', 'was', 'nothing', 'last', 'minute', 'ploy', 'get', 'Spikes', 'character', 'Sunnydale', 'new', 'soul', 'course', 'season', 'had', 'highlights', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'amazing', 'triumph', 'songs', 'are', 'wonderful', 'brilliantly', 'sung', 'cast', 'enjoyed', 'Amber', 'Bensons', 'contribution', 'most', 'also', 'Wrecked', 'Smashed', 'only', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'certain', 'Mr.', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Body', 'kind', 'eery', 'powerful', 'charm', 'viewer', 'very', 'unsettled', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'memorable', 'particulary', 'dialogue', 'Willow', 'Buffy', 'big', 'showdown', 'did', 'enjoy', 'most', 'early', 'Nerds', 'scenes', 'Andrew', 'Jonathan', 'retained', 'kind', 'warped', 'sweetness', 'even', 'when', 'trying', 'be', 'Crimelords', 'made', 'feel', 'very', 'conflicted', 'should', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'them.I', 'suppose', 'season', 'departure', 'others', 'fact', 'emotions', 'characters', 'achieve', 'dominance', 'action', 'change', 'results', 'entirely', 'different', 'tone', 'previous', 'seasons', 'disjointed', 'structure', 'narrative', 'example', 'One', 'episode', 'would', 'deal', 'something', 'important', 'then', 'next', 'would', 'disregard', 'completely', 'main', 'villians', 'are', 'infact', 'nothing', 'more', 'red', 'herrings', 'lose', 'important', 'characters', 'Joyce', 'Tara', 'viewer', 'lot', 'changes', 'upheavals', 'unfortunately', 'really', 'pay', 'off', 'Not', 'say', 'stories', 'should', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'amount', 'grinding', 'misery', 'would', 'help', 'little.Even', 'dispite', 'change', 'pace', 'noticible', 'lack', 'humour', 'season', 'six', 'certain', 'level', 'distinction', 'experimenting', 'already', 'winning', 'formula', 'quite', 'fearless', 'taking', 'well', 'established', 'characters', 'situations', 'down', 'new', 'much', 'darker', 'road', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'credit']",N/A

This was the ""How to create a Big Bad that won't show up until the end of the season but in the meantime, we'll annoy you with the lamest set of ""who cares"" bad guys ever created"" season.  Although there are some fantastic single episodes (Once More, With Feeling comes to mind), this season wasn't so much about Big Bads as it was the Scooby Gang's reactions to the ""realities"" of the real world.  Hmmm.  Can we say ""Big Bore""?  What made Buffy such a phenominal series was that it dealt with a variety Big Bads while simultaneously coping with the reality of teenage life.  If the Big Bads (which is the primary storyline) are removed from the equation, then what we're left with is Dawson's Creek meets the Munsters (secondary storyline).  Granted, the Gang is older and not teenagers anymore, but that's no excuse for not having a viable Big Bad until the last three episodes!  In fact, we had an ENTIRE season of secondary storyline!!Should anyone buy this season?  Yes, Of COURSE!!!  It's BUFFY!!!

777679,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B0000DANYD,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[9, 10]","The most obvious thing to state about Season 6 of Buffy is that a lot of fans hate it, whilst there's a core group who defend it with their lives.  Personally, Season 6 is perhaps the most ambitious season of any TV show in history.  Moving the characters from out of the safe college settings and splitting them up to inflict the depression and monotony of adult life was a brave decision by Joss Whedon.  Among the various story arcs there's Buffy's abusive relationship with Spike, the most complex and interesting relationship the show's had.  Hating Spike, hating herself, Buffy goes into freefall.  There's also the badly handled drugs metaphor of Willow's 'addiction' to magic, which was thankfully partly rectified in Season 7; Xander and Anya drift into a marriage, into adulthood, before Xander decides he's not ready, and Dawn is neglected by the family that's supposed to support her.My first defence of Season 6 would be that whilst admitedly some writers didn't seem to 'get' Whedon's vision for the year (and it's notable that he wasn't around as much), many did, and Season 6 offers up some of the show's best ever moments.  The most obvious, tellingly the only one in the series written by Whedon, was the musical episode Once More With Feeling.  This blew self-indulgent attempts at musical episodes from the likes of Xena and Ally McBeal out of the water.  Not only is each song catchy, hummable, borrowing from a wide variety of sources, but each one is required to eke out the pain, heartbreak or love of characters that feel too emotionally clammed up to talk normally about their feelings rationally.  Plus, Giles and Tara's duet is sublime.  Bargaining Part 1 is probably the best season opener, which set up the darker themes of the season from the get-go.  Dead Things is the single most dark episode the show's ever done (with the possible exception of Lies My Parents Told Me), with Buffy and Spike's relationship coming around on itself as Buffy desire to 'feel' turns inwards on itself in a brilliantly conceived, and very creepy dream sequence.  The big story of the season though, was the death of Tara by geek-turned-murderer Warren accidentally shoot her through her bedroom window.  Though a lot of people have complained that this is some kind of anti-gay comment by Whedon, it's clear to anyone who actually watches the show that this couldn't be any further from the truth.  The hideously unexpected death serves to push Willow over the edge in a spiral of despair and hopelessness that grips you like the show's never gripped you before.  Though Grave is a bit too sentimental, the fact that destroying the world seems to be the only solution to Willow's misery seems appropriate.Unfortunately, Season 6 was marred by a few sub-standard episodes.  Doublemeat Palace of course springs to mind, though Flooded, Life Serial and Hell's Bells never really fulfilled their potential and displayed soapier elements of the show that didn't really work.  In spite of this though, we get to see Sarah Michelle Gellar's best acting to date as her character is fleshed out to become a genuinely complicated and increasingly interesting character.  Her acting in Seeing Red, Once More With Feeling, Afterlife and Normal Again is Emmy-worthy, though predictably it wasn't recognised.Whilst Season 6 wasn't as good as Season 5 it's still an immensely brave and interesting piece of television that will be remembered in years to come as Buffy's more experimental period.  To really appreciate it though you've got to ask yourself whether any other show around could go to places as dark as Season 6 did?

777680,AT8OAKR5SUFMD,B0000DANYD,"Ms. Lynn Guest ""Finns Photo""","[2, 3]","Six is my favorite season. Unlike most reviewers I loved the villians in this season. I thought the trio of nerds was more creative than just another rubber monster. Their ""evil plots"" brought forth humor and creativity with excellent word plays. The acting of the 3 nerds added realistic element, I have known several people like Andrew (creative, wishy washy, approval seeking) and Warren (smooth talker, manipulitive, ego centric) and of course everyone knows a Jonathan, (intelligent, wanting to be taken seriously but only tolerated by the in crowd so his talents could be used.) The ""Big Bad"" though was the main attraction this season.Until Season Six I never paid much attention to Spike, what with the undeniable chemistry between Buffy & Angel. I had actually stopped watching Buffy after the fourth season because why bother when the heavy hitters were gone (Angel and Faith) I only recently watched seasons 5 through 7. Spikes character grew and changed so interestingly I rented all the episodes of Angel that featured him in it so I could follow his character to the end (and had the excellent suprise of seeing Andrews character morph into a really interesting personna).James Marsters ability to convey an emotion with just a widening of his eye and a hint of a smile or a tear is fantastic. I was deeply moved by his reaction to Buffys resurrection and how subtly he played it.Of the episodes that were tops in this season, ONCE MORE WITH FEELING tops the list (the music was so stuck in my head I had to buy the sountrack CD!) SMASHED, the episode that everyone considers so controversial is saved by Marsters acting, again the fluidity and depth of expression with subtle facial changes is what drew me in. The allegory of the house crumbling was beautiful, poetic. The most useless episode, that still managed to have some meaning (again thanks to Marsters, he gave a brief speech to Buffy worth hearing) was DOUBLE MEAT PALACE.I loved the tie up of the loose end concerning Riley in AS YOU WERE. Normal Again was an excellent episode about choices.All together there were so many plots and subplots that engaged me I bought seasons 4, 5, and 7 (mainly so I could trace the evolving character of Spike). This season is the bestand most worth owning since season 2 (Angel is the draw there and the story lines for all the characters are interesting).

777685,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0000DANYD,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[4, 8]","Contrary to most fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I find the controversial sixth season to be the best of the series.  Much darker and maybe even a little meaner than previous seasons, the sixth season of Buffy was the first season to be broadcast on UPN (after the series' move from the WB) and showed the gang we know and love taking on their toughest opponent yet: life.  Beginning with Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Xander (Nicholas Brendon), Anya (Emma Caulfield), and Tara (Amber Benson) raising Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) from the dead, we find Buffy going through the motions since she was torn from her heavenly bliss.  She begins a secret and dangerous affair with vampire Spike (James Marsters) while fighting to keep her sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) from being taken away by social services.  Willow gets drawn deeper and deeper into the addicting darkness of magic, while Xander and Anya rush towards marriage without ever bringing up each other's hesitations.  But there's more going on as well.  Three of their high school contemporaries: Warren (Adam Busch), Jonathan (Danny Strong), and Andrew (Tom Lenk) have taken a criminal turn using magic which begins with petty theft and escalates into murder, ending in the death of Tara and Willow's apocalyptic revenge which threatens the world.  Standout episodes include the ever popular and fantasticly produced ""Once More With Feeling"" in which the entire town of Sunnydale is under the spell of a song and dance demon and features the entire cast singing with their own voices like a musical number, while ""Hell's Bells"" becomes a pivotal episode as the marriage between Xander and Anya goes up in smoke.  In my opinion, season six of Buffy is undoubtadly the best season of the series because it shows the gang more or less going through real, tough life situations that we can't avoid, and by the season's end we are left with a consoling note and feeling of redemption; something that the show richly deserved.",5,The best season of Buffy bar none,1075939200,"02 5, 2004",2004,1985,"['Contrary', 'most', 'fans', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'find', 'controversial', 'sixth', 'season', 'be', 'best', 'series', 'Much', 'darker', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'meaner', 'previous', 'seasons', 'sixth', 'season', 'Buffy', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'be', 'broadcast', 'UPN', 'series', 'move', 'WB', 'showed', 'gang', 'know', 'love', 'taking', 'toughest', 'opponent', 'yet', 'life', 'Beginning', 'Willow', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Xander', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'Anya', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'Tara', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'raising', 'Buffy', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'dead', 'find', 'Buffy', 'going', 'motions', 'was', 'torn', 'heavenly', 'bliss', 'secret', 'dangerous', 'affair', 'vampire', 'Spike', 'James', 'Marsters', 'fighting', 'keep', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'social', 'services', 'Willow', 'drawn', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'addicting', 'darkness', 'magic', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'rush', 'towards', 'marriage', 'ever', 'bringing', 'up', 'other', 'hesitations', 'more', 'going', 'as', 'well', 'Three', 'high', 'school', 'contemporaries', 'Warren', 'Adam', 'Busch', 'Jonathan', 'Danny', 'Strong', 'Andrew', 'Tom', 'Lenk', 'have', 'taken', 'criminal', 'turn', 'using', 'magic', 'petty', 'theft', 'murder', 'ending', 'death', 'Tara', 'Willow', 'apocalyptic', 'revenge', 'world', 'Standout', 'include', 'ever', 'popular', 'fantasticly', 'produced', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'entire', 'town', 'Sunnydale', 'spell', 'song', 'dance', 'demon', 'entire', 'cast', 'singing', 'own', 'voices', 'musical', 'number', 'Hell', 'Bells', 'pivotal', 'episode', 'marriage', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'up', 'smoke', 'opinion', 'season', 'six', 'Buffy', 'undoubtadly', 'best', 'season', 'series', 'gang', 'more', 'less', 'going', 'real', 'tough', 'life', 'situations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'season', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'consoling', 'note', 'feeling', 'redemption', 'something', 'show', 'richly', 'deserved']",N/A

777689,A14AD0NQTRVVJC,B0000DANYD,Patrick J. Sullivan,"[4, 11]","This long review contains numerous spoilers.Season six is one of the darker seasons of Buffy, especially in its first two thirds. Its ending fails to completely satisfy, as Willow is not a very impressive Big Bad. The trio of evil nerds is just not good, period, with the partial exception of the underused Andrew. However, it is the season of Buffy + Spike together, the season where Buffy is forced (by Giles and by circumstance) to really stand up for herself and be an adult and take responsibility for herself and her sister. And what's interesting is that she doesn't precisely succeed.The season begins with a disorienting feeling. Buffy has been dead for five months, having sacrificed herself to save Dawn. The Scoobies are struggling to cover for her absence, using the Buffy-bot to make up for the lack of a real Slayer. With Faith still in prison but alive and thus not replaced, there is no Slayer in Sunnydale, but the denizens of the Hellmouth can't be allowed to know that.Things aren't going much better on the personal front. Willow and Tara have moved into the Summers home to care for Dawn (and to avoid paying rent?) But there's no long-term planning going on as to how the gang will get by financially and otherwise without the Slayer. Everything is a stopgap solution.So the Scoobies, led by Willow, decide that they need to bring back Buffy. They know that the rift she dived into at the end of season five may have led to a very dark place, and they're worried that Buffy may be suffering in some hell dimension as Angel once did for centuries.So Willow casts a spell to bring Buffy back. Only they haven't rescued her from hell, they've yanked her out of heaven and back into the world. To Buffy, who had been at peace where she was, her reentrance to the world is the true hell. But she can't let Willow and Dawn and the others know that. Only to Spike does she reveal the depth of her despair.Spike is still in love with Buffy. He knows to the day exactly how long she's been gone. It's agony for him to hear the Buffy-bot recite any of its admiring phrases. When the real Buffy returns, her feeling of emptiness leads her to turn to him and use him. Not for love, but for solace, and to forget for a little while. She also seems to have lost confidence in herself, and following Giles's departure to England, she needs something to fill the void in her life.Meanwhile, the responsibilities she should be dealing with but can't bring herself to face are piling up. The Summerses have big money problems (wouldn't Joyce have had some insurance? And didn't she own an art gallery?) which among them Giles and Willow and Tara seem to have ignored. Willow and Tara don't seem to pay rent or anything, which might keep Buffy from having to be the only one who works. Dawn has been neglected and is acting out by stealing trinkets, including many from the Magic Box. When Anya finds this last out, she is justifiably furious at Dawn's betrayal of her friendship.Buffy + Spike is not a pretty couple to watch. He genuinely loves her, yet he treats her like trash (probably a product of him still being a soulless demon who loves her as well as it's possible for him to, not to mention his having experienced a century of love/hurt patterning with the insane Dru). Buffy doesn't love Spike, but she uses him nonetheless. When she finally does the right thing and breaks it off for his sake, he can't handle it and tries to rape her. Of all the wonderfully ""wrong"" couples in the Buffyverse, Buffy + Spike may be the best pairing, though the attempted rape of course leaves a bad taste. But everything up to then was great.The events leading up to the beginning of their actual sexual relationship are perhaps even more gripping than the affair itself. A clearly conflicted Buffy will kiss Spike, then later deny that it had meant anything, then kiss him again. Spike doesn't precisely woo Buffy in the traditional sense. For one thing, he punches her in the jaw an awful lot for a hopeful suitor - which we can accept because we know she's a lot stronger than he is.And there's a method to Spike's madness. One of the emotional high marks of the season comes when a triumphant Spike demonstrates to Buffy that he can now hit her without feeling any pain from his brain chip, which normally punishes him for hurting humans. He gleefully explains to a confused Buffy what it must mean: ""Don't you see? You came back WRONG!"" Buffy's fear that he must be right, that she is not the same Buffy who had died but just a counterfeit that isn't even human, undoubtedly plays a large part in her submitting to him sexually.Spike's season ends with him determined to rid himself of his chip. He is tired of being a weakling in love with a Slayer, and tired of not being able to do anything about it. He travels to Africa and thinks he has made a bargain to achieve his goal.A big disappointment in this season is the diminution of Dawn's importance and screen time. Although the season begins where season five had left off as far as the endearingly inappropriate friendship between Spike and Dawn is concerned, this aspect of the characters' lives fades as the season progresses. Perhaps the show's writers thought it would be unfair to Dawn to still have her palling around with Spike after his intense affair with Buffy had begun.Dawn is no longer the key, but she should still be important as a character and as Buffy's only remaining family. Instead, she becomes a klepto for no particular reason and she and Xander and Anya are pushed to the side in favor of Willow.This is the one true flaw of season six, the inflation of Willow's importance at the expense of everyone else. For one thing, I think the show needed a better balance of female and male protagonists, as it had in fact enjoyed during its glory years of the first three seasons. Making Willow practically a co-lead of Buffy's exacerbated the sexual imbalance. It's not a romance or sex thing: just a recognition that most viewers like to see both female and male characters. With Buffy naturally occupying the main position, what the show needed was a stronger presence of Xander and/or Spike, not of Willow.But the main problem with Willow is that neither the character nor the actress is up to part of carrying entire story arcs or season plotlines. The whole point of the Scoobies was always just that: that they were Buffy's supporters - her ""minions,"" as it were. Making Willow far stronger than Buffy (or anyone else), negates the focus of the entire show. Buffy had might as well run off to Rome right now and hit the disco with that Immortal guy. She doesn't have the power to confront Willow, or to significantly aid her.Within the limits of her very modest abilities, Alyson Hannigan was acceptable as Willow because of what the character originally was and wasn't. She was loyal and studious and good-natured. She wasn't sexy or exciting or dramatic or funny. She had never been believable as a brainiac because the actress was clearly in way over her head exchanging repartee with the far more talented Gellar, Brendon, Carpenter, Caulfield, Seth Green, etc. In the early years, it was often painful to watch those actors whip the verbal ball around professionally and then pause politely while Hannigan slowly recited the Willow speeches in her little girl voice.Unfortunately, nothing has really changed since then except for what they're asking of Willow, which is far more than she/Hannigan can provide. Mousy little Willow wearing black contacts isn't a terrifying elemental force - she's still just mousy little Willow and always will be. Making her like girls instead of boys didn't make her any sexier. Now she just has a dull schoolgirl relationship with Tara instead of with Oz.Actually, the Willow character had gone through so many conventional ""rebellions"" in seasons four though six, she was already a walking clich&eacute;. We've all met too many ""individualists"" like Willow. You could set your watch by the utter predictability of her latest phase: ""Hey, I changed my hair! Hey, now I'm a Wicca! Hey, this week I'm a lesbian! Hey, Gaia!"" I suppose I missed the episode where we were lectured about becoming Vegans. She was the poster girl for posers adopting lifestyles as fads. For years I really thought they were setting her up to be smacked down. Maybe that was the original intent. It's hard to believe the show's producers could always have been that humorlessly earnest about such a cardboard rebel.Did I mention I'm not a huge Willow fan anymore? Anyway, in season six she is turned into an out and out jerk, which is far worse and less interesting than if they'd made her a believable threat. The one thing that does come through believably when she's mocking Dawn and then trying to actually harm her is that Willow envies Buffy and resents her friend's accomplishments.I actually found this convincing on a human level. It wouldn't be easy being an anonymous Scooby to the Great Chosen Slayer who is loved and/or feared by all - especially if it turned out you were in actuality far stronger than Buffy. A problem I have with this concept though is that the show never really deals with it, either this season or next. The assumption everyone operates under is that anything bad Willow does is wholly attributable to her addiction to dark magic. It's apparently not the true Willow saying and doing all these mean things, so she gets a free pass for all of them. Forgiveness is all well and good, but Willow seems to automatically be granted it without deserving or even asking for it.Most problematic is the way Buffy repeatedly leaves Dawn in harm's way all the while knowing that Willow is a stick of dynamite waiting to go off. Dawn repeatedly pays the price (or almost does) of Buffy's negligence. Dawn would be safer in Spike's crypt than she is with Time Bomb Willow.And the entire end of the season was unbelievable even within the context of the show. Willow's going to destroy the whole world because Tara died? But she stops because Xander is still her friend? The first idea is unlikely, but once someone makes a decision like that, I don't think Xander blathering on about the good old days of attending kindergarten together is going to change her mind.As for the trio, yes they're lame, and no they're not very funny, except for Andrew at times and very occasionally Jonathan. But they are emphasized in the reverse order of their appeal, and it is obnoxious Warren who is the main nerd. They don't really have any reason to be taking on Buffy (and in Jonathan's case, he's actually being an ingrate in doing so, as she bailed him out more than once in high school). Why not just move to another town instead of plotting to annoy Buffy? It's just mischief for mischief's sake, which isn't very scientific. And we can't really be too amused by them after Warren kills his ex-girlfriend and the others help him cover up. When there are unlikable characters who aren't even competent bad guys, it's hard to justify using as much screen time on them as the trio was given.When things go badly for Warren, it is neither with science nor magic that he reacts but with gunfire. He almost kills Buffy and does kill Tara (though the angle of that shot, which passed through the window and then into Tara's back, is all wrong considering where Warren fired from in the back yard). This tragedy of course is what precipitates Dark Willow's metamorphosis into Evil Willow.Unfortunately, Tara's death just doesn't resonate the way Joyce's or even Jenny Calendar's did. I think the problem was that Tara was never fully fleshed out. She wasn't given any real flaws or personal idiosyncrasies, either normal human ones or esoteric witchly ones like Willow's. She was basically a paragon of patience and prudence and good humor, which is no doubt all very commendable but is also boring and unbelievable. After she died, I realized that the reason I just didn't care is that the character had never seemed alive to begin with.Xander and Anya had long before entered the boredom zone as a couple. I suppose the show's writers felt as much too, and decided that the way to rekindle interest in them was to break them up rather than marry them. The operation was a qualified success. It at least put them both back into play, even if Xander had to come off as hopelessly immature as the price. Their abortive wedding was a great showcase for Spike to ostentatiously bring his loser date to so as to make Buffy jealous. However, the entire plot of Xander's family clashing with Anya's demon friends was ridiculous.Riley returns briefly, happily married to a fellow demon fighter in the special forces. This provided totally unneeded closure to a storyline and character that never should have existed in the first place. Of course the real effect of Riley's return is to highlight to Buffy how empty her life now is.I thought I was going to hate Once More with Feeling when I realized it was a musical. But the episode is a great musical for people who don't care for musicals. True, some of the major leads can barely carry a tune (especially Nicholas Brendon and Sarah Michelle Gellar), and it was left to Giles, Anya, Spike, and Tara to carry the singing load. But the episode wasn't really about singing, it was about revelation. Under the power of the musical spell, Buffy reveals to her friends what she had never wanted to tell them: that instead of saving her from hell, they had pulled her out of heaven. And of course the episode ends with Buffy's and Spike's first kiss.The follow-up episode, Tabula Rasa, is almost as important and revealing. It follows a long-established Buffy pattern of ending a seemingly lighthearted MOTW episode with an emotional bombshell: in this case, Tara's realization that Willow has been magically tampering with her memory. Even Willow realizes that this time she's gone too far to be forgiven. The amnesia plot of the episode itself could have been a failure, but the actors and characters make it work, particularly Spike, Giles, and Anya. Giles was especially good in believing that he was Anya's fianc&eacute; and Spike's disapproving father. And the references to Angel, when Buffy and Spike realize that Spike is a vampire - ""I'm atoning for my sins. I'm the vampire with a soul; I help the helpless!"" - are hilarious, especially when Buffy scoffs at the absurdity of the concept.The best storyline of the season was of course the Buffy + Spike pairing, and as their affair tailed off, so did the season's ability to entertain. Willow's pursuit of vengeance was a poor substitute for Buffy's pursuit of oblivion via Spike. I've said before and I'll say again that when Buffy (and Angel) were successful at making viewers care about the fates of their characters, it was always on an individual level and not a global one. It is possible to believe and fear that Angel will hurt Buffy, that something bad will happen to Joyce or Dawn, that Xander will be maimed, etc. It is possible to fear that in her grief Willow might pursue vengeance too far and do something irreversible that will in turn blight her for life.But it is not really possible for viewers to fear that Willow will destroy the world. The big apocalypses are personally unmoving. It is the credible events affecting individual people that can grip us. When Buffy remembered this fact, it had a real emotional impact. When it forgot this, when the threat became worldwide, then the show lost the ability to truly impact its audience.I place season six in the middle, stronger than one, four, and seven, but not up at the level of two, three, or five. It is indeed one of the darkest years, along with two and five. The darkness is particularly effective in that it comes from within. As wrenching as Angel's betrayal of Buffy had been in season two, that was still an external force that didn't threaten who Buffy was. It was just a very bad thing happening to her. The darkness of season six is a Buffy darkness, made all the worse by the fact that Buffy can't share it with her friends, except for some with Spike. As far as Willow and Xander and Dawn are concerned, everything's super and they've saved the day.The season has more hits than misses, though I wish the writers had let the ""Big Bad"" be Buffy's self-loathing and self-doubt themselves, rather than the three stooges or Goth Willow. Buffy's true enemy this season was Buffy, and more could have been built on that theme.",4,A good season with poor villains,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,16512,"['long', 'review', 'numerous',

777691,A3BSRAFXWY7COC,B0000DANYD,Pete,"[1, 2]","Creator of Buffy, Joss Whedon, sure knows how to pull the rug out from under you. Just when you think ""oh a hell-god as the big bad (from the previous season)they can't top THAT!' Whedon does.Life is the big bad! Buffy gets into some things this season that some viewers might think is heaps dodgy and unlike her character. However in the epic storyline that travels from season 1 through to 7 this season was completely necessary in the growth of the characters.And don't worry the season finale has a big battle, just as with the previous seasons.Over the season Buffy, Xander, Willow, and the gang learn that they've all become grown ups and have to deal with scary adult stuff. This is where season 6's similarity with season 3 comes in. In season 3 growing up and being in high school was freaky and amplified by the fact that it all happened for the scooby gang on a hellmouth. Season 6 is much the same but instead of thinking of their future careers and surviving high school the gang must survive life. Buffy deals with bills, Xander and Anya deal with getting married, while Willow deals with her future as a witch.Meanwhile as this arc continues throughout the season the writers of ""Buffy"" are consistent in creating ""oners"" (episodes that don't necessarily link with the rest of the season); monster-of-the-week episodes.One such episode is the musical, ""Once More With Feeling"", which allows fans and new viewers alike to enjoy. In this episode the residents of Sunnydale, including the scooby gang, start breaking out into song thanks to the arrival of a song-and-dance demon.Another great episode is ""Normal Again"", where Buffy wakes up in a mental institution and must decide which life she believes to be real - the world in which she is a slayer and fights demons, or the world in which things are much more simple and demons don't exist. As Buffy starts turning on her friends this episode is definately a stand-out episode of the season.One of my favourite episodes is ""Older and Far Away"", where Buffy and the scoobies find themselves trapped in Buffy's house with a demon.Dvd features are the best out of all six seasons on dvd. Many hours of extras have gone into these discs, particularly for the musical. There's a great featurette on the last disc that is like a documentary on all of buffy - with clips from season 1, all the way through to season 7! If you want a strong season, great extras and quality dvd (widescreen etc.) you'll be a fan of this package. Look out for easter eggs.",5,Great Season!

777692,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B0000DANYD,P Magnum,"[5, 10]","Season six of Buffy The Vampire Slayer finds the show on a new network (UPN) and Buffy (Sarah Michele Gellar) still dead.  Season six may be the darkest of the show's seven seasons.  The gang raises Buffy from the dead, but they are major consequences.  Buffy isn't the same, she's distant.  We find out that she feels she was in heaven and that Sunnydale is hell to her.  This season also finds Willow (Allyson Hannigan) growing in witch powers to an almost unstoppable force.  Xander (Nicholas Brendon) &amp; Anya (Emma Caufield) get engaged, though Xander ends up with cold feet.  Spike (James Marsters)and Buffy have relations together and Spike becomes more and more entwined with the group.  Amy (Elizabeth Ann Allen) who was turned into a rat in season two is transformed back into a human by Willow and two get into witch trouble together.  Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) goes through growing pains and rebels against Buffy's authority.  The Scooby Gang's new foes are three &quot;supervillans&quot;, Warren (Adam Busch), Jonathan (Danny Strong) and Andrew (Tom Lenk).  They are geeks who were in Buffy's class at Sunnydale High who appeared in previous seasons.

But go right to the nitty gritty. IT WAS A SOAP, it wasn't dark just boring, it was a ""How fast can we wreck these characters lives?"" If only one or two of the characters had been given a bad time, that would've been okay, because we still had the others to fall back on, but NOOOO!!! every character got put through the wringer.I hated the progression of the B/S thing, not because I thought he was evil, but because I thought he had more of a soul than Angel. Think about it, Angel is only good because of a Gypsy curse, when you see flashbacks of him as a mortal, he is scum. Spike, gained our sympathy as he truly loves Buffy, he gained a soul through his love for Buffy. BUT NOOOO!! That's not right, she can't love him, he hasn't been cursed, he hasn't got a soul, he's evil, despite the fact that he's helped them throughout the last 2 season's (without having to) and that he loves her without having to be cursed by Gypsies. So they had her ""wake up!"" and hate herself for lusting after this non-cursed vampire and then to cap it all they have him attempt to rape her. Spike did not have a soul and helped the gang anyway, despite what you can say about the chip and his desire to fight, he still fell in love with Buffy. Angel only loved her because he was cursed with a soul. (watch S2 to see Angel's real persona) Spike managed to love Buffy through the demon that has possessed him, this was a far better relationship than Angel, who only loved her because his personality and feelings were the result of this curse, (remember the curse said that he would be given a soul full of remorse, NOT HIS OWN BACK).Anya and Xander, I would have loved them to be together, they were a great pair, BUT NOOOO!! that doesn't fit in with the general ambience of the series.The Trio should have remained as bumbling would be villains.

777697,A2Q4CZVCN5APDL,B0000DANYD,Rick,"[3, 9]","This is easily the most controversial season of Buffy.  While it garners a favorable four and a half star average rating here, the Buffy fan community at large looks on this season with much contempt. Having read through the other 400 reviews before typing this one, one thing I've seen a lot of is the season six lovers attacking the season six bashers, saying basically 'you just didn't like it or didn't get it because the season was too dark and mature for you!' I like dark and mature subject matter just fine.  In fact, I'm more of an Angel fan than a Buffy fan.  Angel, the darker, more mature spinoff from Buffy is the superior show. Buffy has gone to dark, mature places before.  The second half of Season two is a prime example.  I think I can safely speak on behalf of the Buffy fans who disliked season six that; we don't dislike it because it was too dark and mature, we dislike it because it was a poor lackluster season compared to the earlier seasons of the show.  The show used to tell stories with complex metaphors.  This season it was pretty much Buffy has raunchy sex with Spike a lot. Wait, I must be one of those fans who just hate seasons four and six right?  Nope, loved season four, don't like five.  Hence the title of my review.  The show started going down hill in season five. You can't put all the season six bashers neatly into that often discussed category. It was an incredibly depressing season.  Buffy is depressed because she was resurrected after being pulled out of heaven.  Okay, I'll buy that.  But all the charcter's were in depressing places in their lives this season.  This season, the show made an attempt to convey the harsh realities of real grown up life on the characters.  But they layed on the reality too thick.  Buffy trying to make ends meet by flipping burgers at a fast food joint isn't interesting drama on a fantasy show. What happened to the metaphors?  Oh yes, there was the weak 'Willow is a addicted to magic' drug metaphor we could have done without.  And how can we forget the major annoyance factor this season in the continuing presence of Dawn. I said it in my season five review, I'll repeat it here; they should have killed Dawn rather than Buffy in the season five finale.  Buffy's loss of her sister would have made for some good but not over the top angst in season six, and Dawn not being around to drag the show down further would be a major boost.All that being said, there were some good moments, and I like this season better than season five.  Most notably where Willow becomes evil in the last four episodes. We could have done without the magic/drug metaphor all season, the death of Tara alone would trigger Willow's descent into dark magic, but once it happens, watching Willow, the shy, sweet, computer nerd from season one become the ultimate villain is a sight to behold.  Alyson Hannigan plays it beautifully, no surprise she's the most talented member of the main cast.  Dark Willow and Buffy face off before the fight, Buffy gives a pompous speech about showing her what a slayer is, to which Dark Willow replies ""Ah Buffy, you really need to have every square inch of your ass kicked."" No doubt, one of the best lines in the series. Then an awesome fight scene ensues.If you've never watched a season of Buffy before, don't start here.  If you are a fan of earlier seasons of the show, I can't recommend this season.  I can only recommend it to fans who have already seen most of the episodes in first run or reruns and know what they are getting, or the completist fan division who like to have every episode of a series. This season is still notably better than most of what's on televison.

777698,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0000DANYD,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[9, 15]","The above quote, sung in the musical episode of this season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is possibly the lightest point in the entire show. With episode titles such as ""Wrecked"", ""Smashed"" and ""Grave"", this is certainly the darkest chapter in the Buffy saga.  Last season's finale left us after Buffy had sacrificed herself to save her sister, her friends and the world, and that seemed to be the end of the Slayer. But a summer later, powerful witch Willow has discovered a plan to resurrect her best friend and the guardian of Sunnydale's hellmouth.But things are never that simple, and soon it is revealed that they have forcefully ripped Buffy out of Heaven, and in comparison her life on earth is painful and hellish. With Dawn to look after and bills to pay, Buffy is forced to get a full-time job between her nightly patrols. Whilst Xander and Anya plan their wedding, and Willow steadily falls prey to the intoxicating power of magic, Buffy finds herself spending more and more time with Spike...And on top of all this, three familiar faces from high school are trying their hand at villainy, eventually going from annoying to deadly foes.Season six was just as much Willow's show as it was Buffy's, and for the first time in the show a secondary character steps up to take a place of equal power and significance to Buffy herself. Moving from her normal, chirpy self to a dark and formidable opponent, and all the places in between these two extremes, Alyson Hannigan takes her character to levels that have been building since early episodes in which she first began dabbling with magic. Eventually her progression is taken full circle, especially in regards to her relationship with Xander.Can I share a pet peeve? Season six would have been the ideal opportunity to bring back Hank Summers, the girls' father, one of the most under-used characters in the Buffy-verse. He had previously been established as an absent, but loving father, but now due to his complete absence he comes across as horribly neglectful. What parent leaves their 20 and 15 year old daughters to fend for themselves? His presence would have added stability to the girls' lives, as well as a new spanner in the works and nostalgia as Buffy attempts to hide her calling from him. He could even have been used as a reason to why Giles left (sorry, but I didn't buy the reasons he gave). Plus his reaction to Spike would have been hilarious.He also would have cleared up other issues the show deals with that were somewhat less than exciting: Buffy's trouble with bills, money, loans, counsellors, Dawn, schooling and so on. Buffy flipping burgers for money didn't exactly make for riveting T.V. and by exploring these real-life situations the writers bring up several more problems.  For instance, Willow lives in the Summers house, eating Buffy's food, using her hot water, and wasting her electricity, but we never get a mention of is she pays rent or not. For that matter, does Willow even have a job?The characterisation of Buffy is another problem: where is our spunky, brave young heroine? Granted, she would have felt depressed on re-entering earth, but to drag it out for an entire season was as depressing for us as it was for her. I give the writers credit for trying to take the show in a new direction, but let's face it, no one watches a show called ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" with expectations of something too dark. As it was, we dealt with suicide attempts, drug addition, murder, misogyny, theft, lying, betrayal, casual sex, depression, child neglect, and not one but two attempts at rape. To see characters we've known for years and come to care deeply for dragged through such muck is quite distressing to behold - especially as it seems that the writers really have no idea how to deal with the issues that they're raising.Case in point: Tara's mind is magically altered (ie abused) by Willow, and she sensibly distances herself from her violator. By the time reconciliation is reached however, she doesn't want to go over the rebuilding of trust and respect - instead to jump straight to the kissing. Yes, I know it's all fiction, but these are dangerous and series issues to raise, people do have these sort of problems in life, and they can't be brushed under the rug as easily as they are on the show.But it wasn't all bad, and there are a few outstanding moments. The famous musical episode ""Once More With Feeling"" deserves a place among the top ten Buffy episodes of all time, with catchy songs, extraordinary pathos, some of the funniest lines ever, and the depth of feeling and emotion that only singing can bring out. As well as this, Tara and Anya finally get some personalities that go beyond the droll-and-sarcastic comic-relief and the sweet-but-dull girlfriend. We get some new characters; Hallie, an old acquaintance of Anya's, and Clem the not-so-evil demon. Amy the witch (who has appeared in every single season except season five) finally gets de-ratted, and stirs up some trouble for Willow when she introduces her to some darker magics. Unfortunately, Amy was always a favourite guest-star of mine, and I was bummed to see her end up somewhat evil. I was hoping for redemption, but sadly it doesn't happen. Oh well, at least she was de-ratted. Riley's back for a quick visit, and as always we're treated with a breathtaking finale.Love it or hate it, season six is a necessary part of the ongoing Buffy story, and don't worry - things pick up for the final season.",2,"""They Got the Mustard Out!""",1099008000,"10 29, 2004",2004,5490,"['above', 'quote', 'sung', 'musical', 'episode', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'possibly',

777699,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000DANYD,Robert Moore,"[157, 167]","Note:  Insert standard spoiler warning of your choice here!Season Six of BUFFY is the show's most controversial by far.  Sarah Michelle Gellar has stated that she found the mid-season episodes between her and Spike to be degrading and unpleasant and many fans would agree with her.  This was the season that Joss Whedon left the show as the day-to-day show runner and turned over the reins to Marti Noxon, though he nonetheless remained deeply involved with the show, supervising the story arcs and individual episodes, as well as writing and directing several episodes.There is no question that Season Six contained some very memorable moments.  There is also little question that the season had some weak episodes--especially at around the two-thirds mark--as well as some not-very-popular story arcs.  The least popular aspects of the show was the self-destructive tendencies and actions of all the major characters and the lameness of the show's ""big bads,"" the geek threesome known as The Trio.  But in fact, the Big Bad of Season Six is each individual against him or herself.  Buffy, struggling with her inadvertent removal from heaven by Willow, suffers economic difficulties, eventually taking a fast food job, eventually numbing herself with a demeaning sexual relationship with Spike.  Willow becomes more and more addicted to using magic, to the point that it first threatens to destroy her relationships and eventually the world.  Xander, fearful that his impending marriage to Anya cold lead to the same kind of family that he grew up in, leaves Anya a the altar.  Anya, crushed by being deserted by Xander, reverts to being a vengeance demon.  Dawn's kleptomania gets out of control until the others discover her problem.  Giles makes an error by going back to England, imagining that Buffy needs to learn to live on her own.  Only Tara does not engage in self-destructive behavior, but her accidental killing spurs Willow's killing spree at the end of the season.  The season's motto could be:  We have met the enemy and he is us.There are titular villains.  Warren, the robot-constructing geek from Season Five's ""I Was Made to Love You,"" Jonathan, the geek who first appeared in the BUFFY pilot (he was considered for the role of Xander before Nicholas Brendon got the job), and Andrew, whose brother was involved in a flying monkey incident no one seems to remember, team up to take over Sunnydale.  They are uber dorks, obsessed with the whole panoply of comic book culture and Star War action figures.  Though them manage to pull off some stunts, apart from Warren's accidental killing of both his ex-girlfriend and Willow, they are a pretty silly lot.  They are more like perpetual comic relief.  BUFFY was always trying to do new things and I applaud them for doing so (the effort to always be fresh was one of the reasons it was such a great show), but I think it is safe to say that having them as the Big Bads was a bit of a mistake.  In the end, their greatest contribution was in providing victims for Willow's rampage at season's end.  Indeed, the single most horrifying moment in the history of the show had to be the terrible instance in which Willow, after catching and briefly torturing Warren for killing Tara, magically removes his entire epidermis.  Not just on BUFFY, apart from some moments in THE SOPRANOS, I know no more terrible instance in the history of TV.  Clearly they wanted to demonstrate just how far Willow had gone.Although the season's story arcs were not especially satisfying, there were a number of unforgettable episodes.  The season begins with a great sequence of episodes, as Willow with the assistance of Tara, Xander, and Anya raise Buffy, who had died a mystical death at the end of Season Five, from the dead.  Their fear, based largely on Angel's being sent to a hell dimension at the end of Season Two, was that Buffy was suffering unspeakable torture in a different hell dimension.  But we later learn that she was, in fact, in a place of great peace and repose, a place she could only describe as ""heaven.""  The first six episodes see Buffy struggling to deal with her return to a place that now felt like hell.  All these early episodes, even if not strong all the way through, contain at least some great moments.Then come Episodes 7 and 8, not just the best episodes of the season, but among the best in the run of the show.  ""Once More, with Feeling"" is often cited as the very best episode of BUFFY, and to those who wish the show had ended at the end of Season Five, my response is always, ""Would you really have wanted for there never to have been ""Once More, With Feeling?""  This was the musical episode and while many shows have attempted musical episodes, this one stands far above what any other show has either attempted or achieved.  What is amazing is how fine the episode was despite not having a world of musical talent on the show.  Only Anthony Stewart Head (who had taken over the lead in THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW in London in the original production and sung on albums by his brother Murray, the original Judas in JESUS CHRIST, SUPERSTAR), James Marsters (who headed his own rock band), and Amber Benson (who played Tara) had especially good voices.  Though not a trained singer, Sarah Michelle Gellar nonetheless acquitted herself quite well both singing and dancing, and Michelle Trachtenberg, though not a singer, put her dance training to good use. Joss Whedon contributed a very fine group of songs.  In one of the best guest appearances in the run of the show, veteran Broadway hoofer Hinton Battle (perhaps best known as the Scarecrow in the entire run of THE WIZ on Broadway) played the demon Sweet, who was accidentally summoned to Sunnydale, and who was responsible for the singing and dancing afflicting everyone.  The most amazing thing about the episode was the way that the songs advanced every story arc in the show and greatly accelerated the action.  The best songs were Buffy's Disneyesque ""Going Through the Motions"" that started the episode; Tara's singing of ""Under Your Spell"" to Willow (ironic in that she learned she was literally being controlled by Willow through magic); Spike's passionate expression of his love/hate for Buffy in ""Rest in Peace""; the wonderful duet between Tara and Giles; and the great production number that preceded the battle-that-never-occurred with Sweet, ""Walk Through the Fire.""  Not should also be made of Anya's great bit in an early group number in which the Scoobies are trying to figure out why everyone is singing and dancing.  After singing that she has a theory that it ""must be bunnies,"" the group very ignores her only to have her scream in a great hard rock voice:Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposedThey got them hoppy legs and twitchy little nosesAnd what's with all the carrots?What do they need such good eyesight for anyway?Bunnies!  Bunnies!  It must be bunnies!The popularity of the episode can be seen in the fact that it is the only episode to have its script published separately and the soundtrack has been released on compact disc.""Once More, with Feeling"" was followed by ""Tabula Rasa,"" probably the funniest episode ever on BUFFY.  After Tara catches Willow manipulating their relationship through the use of magic, Willow complicates things by attempting once more to make them all forget that she had used magic to control others.  But the spell misfires and instead everyone in the group, including Willow, forgets who they are.  The scene in which everyone tries to figure out who they are is a classic, the best part being Spike, who has been going about in a dreadful suit as a disguise to escape a loan shark (a demon with literally the head of a shark, the only really awful note in an otherwise stunning episode), deciding that his is Giles's son and that his name is Randy.  When Buffy finds no ID, she tellingly decides that everyone should call her Joan, with echoes of St. Joan in her choice.Unfortunately, while there are few out and out bad episodes, there are few absolutely stunning episodes until the ones that end the season.  The one major exception is ""Normal Again,"" which resembles many of the alternative reality stories of Philip K. Dick.  Buffy is injected with some venom by a demon she fights, and the result is that she imagines that she is actually in a mental institution where she has been fantasizing for several years that she was a vampire slayer in a town called Sunnydale.  Or is reality breaking through to make her cease fantasizing for a while.  We fans, of course, can't imagine that all six seasons were a delusion, but it is nonetheless a brilliant episode.Although I don't believe that this is one of BUFFY's best seasons, I can't give this less than five stars simply because even during this season BUFFY remained one of the most brilliant shows on TV.  Not everything in the season succeeded, but they nevertheless continually strove to produce a special show.  The show took risks; they never played things safe.  The problem with taking risks is that sometimes things don't work out.  Still, all in all this was a season with more to delight over than to regret.",5,BUFFY's most controversial and uneven season,1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,9193,"['Note', 'Insert', 'standard',

Here was an episode both original and reccent BTVS fans agreed upon for innovation and quality.""Walk through the fire's"" morose-but melodic chorus from Buffy herself (Sarah Michelle Gellar) would have been an awesome theme song for the show if the producing team had wanted to update the BTVS opening credits. Alas, it was not to be.Anthony Stewart Head had previously appeared on stage productions of the Rocky Horror Picture Show...etc but his vocal range was less impressive in OMWF. This honor goes to James Marster's ""Rest in Peace"" which combines rock and roll with the supernatural. I have not had such an arrangement stuck in my head since the theme song to the short-lived ""Munsters Today"" from the late 1980's.I would not recomend the entire BTVS season six at large, but this one episode is an interesting experience which should not be missed. Since the CD is available as a separate entitiy, it would be awesome to make a separate DVD just for this episode.

777701,A2RFLE6TT1LZAT,B0000DANYD,Rolf Hartmann,"[12, 24]","The defence That this season is too dark doesn't hold up when this season is compared to other seasons. This is the only real defence offered for season six. Most other seasons 2,3,4,5 are at least as dark, but they aren't boring. Dark can be many things and it doesn't have to be boring. Saying it's dark as the excuse for every one of the problems isn't a line of argument it's religous mantra or a soap box routine, depending on what crowd is present.This season has no concept that Spike was ever a good character. Even Anya as a human is show to be physicaly stronger.Any character outside of the clique of three (Buffy, Willow, Xander) has not rights. Xander dumps Anya in a roomfull of her friends (many of who are vengence demons) and not one of them does anything about it. Xander the uncoordinated, out of shape, jerk beats the hell out of a legendary vampire with ease. With a little motivation Spike could wipe out the Harris family tree, chip or no chip. If Spike didn't want the pain he could have used harmless grapling untill Xander was exausted.Buffy's trauma isn't the reason for her treating others the way she does, it's just her excuse.Willow's personality is supperseded by her powers. Even when she gives magic up, instead of seeing some of her old Willowisms she pulls out a laptop as if that's all she is.The dissolution of the personatilies of the principal characters, and the clear lack of regard the writters hold for the secondary charactes is the reason why I hate this season. Not some supposed &quot;Darkness&quot;.I give it 2 stars because of great performances from Alyson Hannigan, Emma Caulfield, and James Marsters.

Think about it: Buffy comes back from heaven and all of a sudden it's la la la la la... The show has always been very realistic in portraying it's characters and at this point of their lives, everyday is a constant struggle, esp. for Buffy. Her destructive relationship with Spike is one of the most interesting the show has ever seen. While the villians brought a certain lightness to the show, Warren turned out to be very dangerous. We watched as Willow dealt with her addiction to magic and Anya's frustration over her wedding to Xander... these were two of the most powerful aspects of this season. I think people underestimate Emma Caulfield's work on the show. She brings such a bubbly personality but can be heartbreaking as well. The tragedy that happens at the end of the season that sets up an arc with 'Bad Willow' comes as such a shock and is so devestating to watch. It was nice to see that Xander saved the world instead of Buffy. It made much more sense. Also, Giles's return at the end of the season is terrific.

This season, as I have come to realize, takes time to truly appreciate.I was happy that the writers put Spike with Buffy but I was disappointed that their relationship was not more romantic. I grew to hate their [] relationship because it was more about lust than love. I was bothered that it lacked the love of the Buffy/Angel relationship. I now understand and appreciate their (Spike and Buffy's) relationship more now that I understand it was never about love or intimacy. Buffy was with Spike so she could feel less emotionally numb. She never wanted love from him. She just wanted to feel something. This relationship angered many Buffy fans for a while but it is more appreciated now. I like the destructive relationship a little more now because I can see how complex it truly was. It (the relationship) hurt Spike and it made him realize that he had a great dilemma with Buffy: He is unable to be a monster or a man. He is nothing. This realization forces him to fight for a soul and become a (vampire) man as good as Angel. This realization truly changes Spike into a more complex and fascinating character in the seventh season of Buffy.This season of Buffy is great because it has lead to some of the best character development with Spike. It's dark, unsettling and hard to watch at first but it really pulls you in on repeated viewings. I used to think this was one of the worst seasons of Buffy before I realized how deep it truly was.

For several reasons the season was actually excellent.The good:The Musical episode well everyone would probably say that it is truely a classic, I consider it a general television classic and a highlight of what was a truly dark year in 2001 for me personally and alot of other people. It was truly a golden moment for alot of Buffy fans and brought what was an otherwise dark season alot of light.Spike, say what you will but Spike is a interesting character and was at his best this season.Tara's death, hey I love to see bad characters get the axe, even if it is in a relatively cold way.Dawn, she actually is much better in this season then in 5 and since she becomes nearly irrelevant season 7 this was her best season.The Bad:The wedding episode, Xander and Annya were just great togeather to seperate them just seemed unnecessary and was done very poorly.  Following this both characters seemed to have little purpose and really didn't for the remainder of the series.Willow and Tara, I could really care less about their relationship it just dragged this season, the lesbian sterotypes were just way too much and the drama created between these two would have been enough to drive most couples to suicide.Evil Willow: I have no problem with evil Willow actually, she was really evil and that was a great change from the geeks who were just sad and seemed to be a direct shot at the fanbase, a show is never good when it makes fun of its own fans. But getting back to evil Willow she was bad she was really bad so bad she was unredemable, she had to die, and should have died at the end of the season. Sometimes you send a character down a dark path from which there is no hope and their was none for Willow her actions called for her elimination.  The fact that she was saved and showed little remourse the following season makes season 7 nearly unwatchable because their easy forgiveness of Willow was uncalled for. Sometimes you loose friends this was a time Willow was too forgone and had to die, the Willow Character from here on out seems fake, if she had died at the end of this season it would have been 4 stars but as it is she didn't.There you go feel free to disagree but in the end you Buffy fans know I am right about this one.",3,Goes a little too dark,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,2310,"['Season', 'six', 'not', 'bad', 'good', 'previous', 'seasons', 'several', 'reasons', 'season', 'was', 'actually', 'excellent.The', 'good', 'Musical', 'episode', 'well', 'everyone', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'truely', 'classic', 'consider', 'general', 'television', 'classic', 'highlight', 'what', 'was', 'truly', 'dark', 'year', '2001', 'personally', 'alot', 'other', 'people', 'was', 'truly', 'golden', 'moment', 'alot', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'brought', 'what', 'was', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'season', 'alot', 'light.Spike', 'say', 'what', 'will', 'Spike', 'interesting', 'character', 'was', 'best', 'season.Tara', 'death', 'hey', 'love', 'see', 'bad', 'characters', 'get', 'axe', 'even', 'relatively', 'cold', 'way.Dawn', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'season', 'then', '5', 'nearly', 'irrelevant', 'season', '7', 'was', 'best', 'season.The', 'Bad', 'wedding', 'episode', 'Xander', 'Annya', 'were', 'just', 'great', 'togeather', 'seperate', 'just', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'poorly', 'Following', 'characters', 'seemed', 'have', 'little', 'purpose', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'remainder', 'series.Willow', 'Tara', 'could', 'really', 'care', 'less', 'relationship', 'just', 'dragged', 'season', 'lesbian', 'sterotypes', 'were', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'drama', 'created', 'two', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'drive', 'most', 'couples', 'suicide.Evil', 'Willow', 'have', 'problem', 'evil', 'Willow', 'actually', 'was', 'really', 'evil', 'was', 'great', 'change', 'geeks', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'sad', 'seemed', 'be', 'direct', 'shot', 'fanbase', 'show', 'never', 'good', 'when', 'fun', 'own', 'fans', 'getting', 'back', 'evil', 'Willow', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'unredemable', 'had', 'die', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'end', 'season', 'Sometimes', 'send', 'character', 'down', 'dark', 'path', 'hope', 'was', 'none', 'Willow', 'actions', 'called', 'elimination', 'fact', 'was', 'saved', 'showed', 'little', 'remourse', 'following', 'season', 'season', '7', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'easy', 'forgiveness', 'Willow', 'was', 'uncalled', 'Sometimes', 'loose', 'friends', 'was', 'time', 'Willow', 'was', 'too', 'forgone', 'had', 'die', 'Willow', 'Character', 'here', 'out', 'fake', 'had', 'died', 'end', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'been', '4', 'stars', ""didn't.There"", 'go', 'feel', 'free', 'disagree', 'end', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'know', 'am', 'right', 'one']",N/A

Many seemed turned off by this and the notion of throwing in three delusional comic relief characters in the Triad. (Which were not the main baddies of the season). Well.. I have to say the season is really just as good as any of the others. In fact, some of the episodes like, &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot; are really some of the best. The season is more complicated, becuase we don't have &quot;one&quot; central bad guy. There are a number of various &quot;antagonists&quot; that the Scooby Gang face, and this makes for very interesting TV.It's sometimes difficult to watch some of these beloved characters take a turn for the worse, or make bad decisions... but it's what the creators chose to do with the season and it pays off. It's unpredictable. It doesn't follow the same formula as past seasons, and for that I commend the creators for taking a chance, and giving us an excellent season.If there were anything in the season I personally didn't like... it was the choice to have Giles leave the Scooby Gang. Although I totally understand the story-arcs of Buffy having to become an adult on her own, and the gang falling apart without him... he was a presence sorely missed on screen.The Triad never bothered me, because I knew they were not the biggest threat of the season. I knew that &quot;life&quot; was the biggest threat... and it was clear due to the fact that Buffy was brought back against her will, from a better place. She automatically set up the theme for the season.So my recommendation is that if you're looking for much of the same story-arcs you got in previous seasons... you may be turned off by this one. If you're looking for the gang to go through something completely new... then pick this one up now.",4,Just As Good As Any Other Season...,1090368000,"07 21, 2004",2004,1870,"['**SPOILERS', 'AHEAD**There', 'doubt', 'Season', '6', 'dark', 'Scooby', 'Gang', 'much', 'darker', 'waters', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Many', 'seemed', 'turned', 'off', 'notion', 'throwing', 'three', 'delusional', 'comic', 'relief', 'characters', 'Triad', 'were', 'not', 'main', 'baddies', 'season', 'Well..', 'have', 'say', 'season', 'really', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'fact', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'quot', 'are', 'really', 'best', 'season', 'more', 'complicated', 'becuase', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'quot', 'one', 'quot', 'central', 'bad', 'guy', 'are', 'number', 'various', 'quot', 'quot', 'Scooby', 'Gang', 'face', 'very', 'interesting', 'TV.It', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'watch', 'beloved', 'characters', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'make', 'bad', 'decisions', 'what', 'creators', 'chose', 'do', 'season', 'unpredictable', ""n't"", 'follow', 'same', 'formula', 'past', 'seasons', 'commend', 'creators', 'taking', 'chance', 'giving', 'excellent', 'season.If', 'were', 'anything', 'season', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'choice', 'have', 'Giles', 'leave', 'Scooby', 'Gang', 'totally', 'understand', 'story-arcs', 'Buffy', 'having', 'become', 'adult', 'own', 'gang', 'falling', 'apart', 'was', 'presence', 'sorely', 'missed', 'screen.The', 'Triad', 'never', 'bothered', 'knew', 'were', 'not', 'biggest', 'threat', 'season', 'knew', 'quot', 'life', 'quot', 'was', 'biggest', 'threat', 'was', 'clear', 'due', 'fact', 'Buffy', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'will', 'better', 'place', 'automatically', 'set', 'up', 'theme', 'season.So', 'recommendation', ""'re"", 'looking', 'much', 'same', 'story-arcs', 'got', 'previous', 'seasons', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'one', ""'re"", 'looking', 'gang', 'go', 'something', 'completely', 'new', 'then', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'now']",N/A

Season 6 is one of the darker ones as is season 5, a short recap if you've not watched 5. At the end of season 5 Buffy sacrifices herself to save her sister Dawn's life. Season 6 begins with the Scooby Gang making plans to bring Buffy back from the dead and they do, although it doesn't quite go as planned. After her return Buffy has trouble dealing with the fact that she was brought back although I'm not going to reveal why, you'll have to watch it find out.

They are quite possibly the funniest villians the show has ever had. (Besides spike of course)It was a constant joy every minute they were on screen. It's about time we had villians who provided laughs. I went back of course and got all 4 seasons on DVD as they were released. Fell in love with those as well.

As soon as Buffy gets resurrected, she gets a look on her face like she doesn't want to be there and have anything to do with it - which I took to be a commentary on Sarah Michelle Gellar's attitude towards the show itself. And as the season progressed, everyone seemed to be falling into the worst After School Special imaginable. Suddenly magic isn't a great deus ex machina but an addiction for Willow. Buffy is unable to connect with anyone but Spike, mostly because her friends are incapable of understanding her. The few characters that aren't messed up are trying their hardest to get away from their sad friends.And that musical episode - I think I was spoiled for it by dozen of sing-along events. Also, it's a little more difficult to overlook the fact that the episode ends with Buffy trying to kill herself.But as I watched the entire season, I started to respect the season and what it was trying to do (on purpose or accidentally) which seems to be to depict clinical depression in all its uncomfortable aspects. I found the articles that linked the Trio to Buffy's depression and the ways that their attacks on her reflected her symptoms. And I was impressed by the way that there was no magic button to push that snapped everyone out of it. There were moments like Riley coming back and giving her a pep talk but for the most part, little by little the characters worked through their issues and found ways of coping with the misery.And yeah, Xander and the broken yellow crayon gets to me every time.This is a messy and uneven season, but it does find its bearing and leaves the viewer with great moments.",3,The most depressing season of Buffy - although that might not be a bad thing,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,1729,"['When', 'first', 'start', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'depressing', 'season', 'was', 'As', 'soon', 'Buffy', 'resurrected', 'look', 'face', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'took', 'be', 'commentary', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'attitude', 'show', 'season', 'progressed', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'be', 'falling', 'worst', 'School', 'Special', 'imaginable', 'Suddenly', 'magic', ""n't"", 'great', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'addiction', 'Willow', 'Buffy', 'unable', 'connect', 'anyone', 'Spike', 'mostly', 'friends', 'are', 'incapable', 'understanding', 'few', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'messed', 'up', 'are', 'trying', 'hardest', 'get', 'away', 'sad', 'friends.And', 'musical', 'episode', 'think', 'was', 'spoiled', 'dozen', 'sing-along', 'events', 'Also', 'little', 'more', 'difficult', 'overlook', 'fact', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'trying', 'kill', 'herself.But', 'watched', 'entire', 'season', 'started', 'respect', 'season', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'purpose', 'accidentally', 'be', 'depict', 'clinical', 'depression', 'uncomfortable', 'aspects', 'found', 'articles', 'linked', 'Trio', 'Buffy', 'depression', 'ways', 'attacks', 'reflected', 'symptoms', 'was', 'impressed', 'way', 'was', 'magic', 'button', 'push', 'snapped', 'everyone', 'were', 'moments', 'Riley', 'coming', 'back', 'giving', 'pep', 'talk', 'most', 'part', 'little', 'little', 'characters', 'worked', 'issues', 'found', 'ways', 'coping', 'misery.And', 'yeah', 'Xander', 'broken', 'yellow', 'crayon', 'time.This', 'messy', 'uneven', 'season', 'find', 'bearing', 'viewer', 'great', 'moments']",N/A

Put me in the latter category.The season was -- different. Buffy's back, but she's not the girl we knew. Willow's going all freaky. Xander -- well, Xander makes some questionable decisions in this season, and Anya is, um, herself. Anthony Stewart Head was coming &amp; going, and so Giles was as well, and the Trio presented a different take on the &quot;Big Bad&quot; concept by not being very big, and being rather bad at being bad... until the end, that is. Rumor has it that even Sarah Michelle Geller wasn't entirely thrilled with her character this season, and it's true that things went in a Spike-y direction you never could have predicted a few seasons back.But I loved this season for precisely those reasons -- the change, the topsy-turvy turning everything on its head, characters going out of whack, reacting to events in ways you couldn't have predicted... but when you bring a girl back from the dead, you know, all bets are off.Mostly, I applaud Joss Whedon for being completely unafraid to take risks in season 6, to challenge everyone's perceptions and go down roads that some may of preferred he hadn't. No season of Buffy is dull or predictable, but after five years, it would have been all too easy to crank out another monster or god hell-bent on destroying the world, and then let us watch the Scoobies figure out how to get the job done. They do, of course, as always, when push comes to shove -- but not without a lot of missteps, misunderstandings, and casualties along the way.

Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[1, 3]","Well here it is, the sixth season of Buffy.Chances are if you ask almost any fan what there least favorite season of Buffy is they will tell you either 4 or 6.  But the thing about that is, even though it is a contender for worst season, it is still one of the best written, acted, and made tevelvision season to date.  The budget was almost tripled from the fifth season to this season and you can definatley tell the difference.The season is basically about growing up.  Buffy returns from Heaven the premier and basically everything goes downhill... Giles leaves town, Dawns starts runing around with Vampires, Willow and Tara break-up, Xander and Anya Break-up.  But all through the season you can tell that the characters are growing and learning.  But then with the growing up comes the big emotional bag of paine.When the season opens Buffy has just returned from Heaven, and she is totally depressed;  Giles has moved back home to England so Buffy can learn to be an adult; and a group of nerds from the past unite to become the ""big-bad."" But as all this happens nobody releizes Willow growing addiction to magic, except for Tara, who eventually breaks up with her.  But when Tara and Willow get back together, Tara is tragedically killed by Warren, and Willow is so grief striken she loses all sense of control and goes on a murdereous war-path.This season may be one of the worst but it still contains the single episode of the series that would have given Joss Whedon the emmy (if it hadn't of been left off the ballot), Once more With Feeling, and then the alwasy questioning episode, Normal Again.  Once more, with Feeling is ofcourse the epic musical episode, and Normal Again, is an episode where Buffy starts to think that Sunnydale is nothing but a dream (many fans including me where hopeing this would tie-into the series finale).  But with every great season you get your share of stinkers with ""After Life"" and ""Doublemeat Palace"" (which in my opion is the worst episode of the series).I am really looking forward to this set especially for the commentary for ""Once more with Feeling"" that has been promised.

Dawn, having no personality of her own and being an incredibly shallow, flat character, cannot hold together the plotline of an entire episode, as she was expected to do in this season's Halloween episode. Dawn is no better than Cordelia in character development, and she has less purpose. The show could have done without all the excessive Buffy and Spike scenes, as he was more fun when trying to kill her, rather than having sex with her, which was just redundant. Still, while the season lacks a good antagonist, it has a great many episodes that are original, fun, and classic Buffy. The last three episodes with an Evil Willow was a wonderful ending, with the sole exception of her not continuing her dark witchiness to the next season. By the ending of this season, Willow was without a doubt the only strong character left, and she would have proven a worthy adversary in the seventh season (instead of simply being in the background). This would have provided an interesting subplot to divert from the tiring First Evil plot. Indeed, by the end of this season, only Willow seems to have really developed progressively, with Buffy going a little too far into the sister/mother role for Dawn, Xander still whining over Anya, Anya being a somewhat less-than-evil vengeance demon, Giles stepping out, and Spike...well he just sleeps with Buffy. It is a toss up over the worst episode of this season, the Halloween episode, or the one where Riley returns to remind us of what the world was like last season, but there were far more successful episodes than failures.",4,Vintage Buffy,1066867200,"10 23, 2003",2003,1744,"['sixth', 'season', 'continued', 'spirit', 'included', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'met', 'slight', 'downfall', 'trying', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'Dawn', 'Dawn', 'having', 'personality', 'own', 'being', 'incredibly', 'shallow', 'flat', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'together', 'plotline', 'entire', 'episode', 'was', 'expected', 'do', 'season', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'Dawn', 'better', 'Cordelia', 'character', 'development', 'less', 'purpose', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'excessive', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'scenes', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'when', 'trying', 'kill', 'rather', 'having', 'sex', 'was', 'just', 'redundant', 'Still', 'season', 'good', 'antagonist', 'great', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'original', 'fun', 'classic', 'Buffy', 'last', 'three', 'episodes', 'Evil', 'Willow', 'was', 'wonderful', 'ending', 'sole', 'exception', 'not', 'continuing', 'dark', 'witchiness', 'next', 'season', 'ending', 'season', 'Willow', 'was', 'doubt', 'only', 'strong', 'character', 'left', 'would', 'have', 'proven', 'worthy', 'adversary', 'seventh', 'season', 'instead', 'simply', 'being', 'background', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'divert', 'tiring', 'First', 'Evil', 'plot', 'Indeed', 'end', 'season', 'only', 'Willow', 'have', 'really', 'developed', 'progressively', 'Buffy', 'going', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'sister/mother', 'role', 'Dawn', 'Xander', 'still', 'whining', 'Anya', 'Anya', 'being', 'somewhat', 'less-than-evil', 'vengeance', 'demon', 'Giles', 'stepping', 'out', 'Spike', 'well', 'just', 'Buffy', 'toss', 'up', 'worst', 'episode', 'season', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'one', 'where', 'Riley', 'remind', 'what', 'world', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'episodes', 'failures']",N/A

The show always used personal problems for character development, and to create drama, but they never used topics as heavy or twisted as these. This is what makes it the darkest season of them all.The levity in the season actually came from the main villains. They had the funniest dialogue of the entire series and the actors delivered it perfectly. They were the most comical characters of the series. They helped make this the funniest season of them all.A lot of the season's success should also be given to the writers decision to finally unleash Spike (though, for some odd reason, they decided to leash him again in season eight). He was always the most interesting character on the show and may be the most entertaining serial killer ever created. No one else created so much havoc just by their presence and in this season they let him become part of the group (kind of). Just imagine the possibilities for season eight if the writers had chosen the other option for him in the season finale.Season two might be the most nostalgic. Season five might have the best episode.

While I cannot say the same for Season 6, I can say that it is extremely complex and interesting and I enjoyed my watch.Season 6 deals with failed hopes and dreams, sadness, heartache, and is by far the darkest season we have seen of the show. We see Buffy brought back from the dead only to suffer from depression, Willow's addiction to magic, Giles leaving for London, and Anya and Xander's engagement that is full of doubt. While this all entertaining early in the season, the episodes really begin to drop in quality until it approaches the last episodes, more of our favorite television show at high quality! Some of the positives are the amazing beginning episodes, a handful of stand out episodes, and an interesting view of the beloved characters and their relationships. As said before, the middle of the season drags around. But to add to this we have another negative in Willow's addiction arc. I was not totally loving the theme and thought the people behind the show could have made things more compelling and interesting to watch. Thankfully, the final episode was worthwhile, but not up to rank with previous season endings.In conclusion, while I did enjoy this season, there is a reason for the criticism it draws in. I am extremely excited for watching season 7 but sad at the same time, knowing the show does not continue on.",4,"Indulgence of depression and addiction, a mixed but good season",1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,1493,"['first', 'watch', 'show', 'already', 'become', 'one', 'favorites', 'previous', 'season', 'was', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'Season', '6', 'can', 'say', 'extremely', 'complex', 'interesting', 'enjoyed', 'watch.Season', '6', 'deals', 'failed', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'sadness', 'heartache', 'far', 'darkest', 'season', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'see', 'Buffy', 'brought', 'back', 'dead', 'only', 'suffer', 'depression', 'Willow', 'addiction', 'magic', 'Giles', 'leaving', 'London', 'Anya', 'Xander', 'engagement', 'full', 'doubt', 'entertaining', 'early', 'season', 'episodes', 'really', 'begin', 'drop', 'quality', 'last', 'episodes', 'more', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'high', 'quality', 'positives', 'are', 'amazing', 'beginning', 'episodes', 'handful', 'stand', 'episodes', 'interesting', 'view', 'beloved', 'characters', 'relationships', 'said', 'middle', 'season', 'around', 'add', 'have', 'negative', 'Willow', 'addiction', 'arc', 'was', 'not', 'totally', 'loving', 'theme', 'thought', 'people', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'things', 'more', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Thankfully', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'not', 'rank', 'previous', 'season', 'endings.In', 'conclusion', 'did', 'enjoy', 'season', 'reason', 'criticism', 'am', 'extremely', 'excited', 'watching', 'season', '7', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'knowing', 'show', 'not', 'continue']",N/A
777732,A3DKZIGPQTJF2S,B0000DANYD,Zombie Kermit,"[2, 2]","I'm only a relatively new fan of Buffy. It was only around a year ago that I had not seen a single episode, and picked up the first season after wanting to check it out for a while. It didn't take me long to get hooked. I picked up the remaining seasons as quickly as possible, doing my best to not run out of episodes to watch until I reached the very end.I would rank my two favourite seasons as being 5 and 7. I think they were both truly amazing seasons. But sandwiched between the two, was Season 6, which I found to be surprisingly mixed in quality.I suppose much of it can be traced to the aftereffects of some of the events of season 5, but much of the characters seemed.... well, just a little off. Buffy's borderline nymphomania, Spike's general desertion of all his character development of the previous season, and various other character choices that struck me as odd and out of place.I guess another issue I had with it is something that many might find a positive. For me, it sort of lacked the story that the other seasons had, without a clear threat looming overhead. Thing is, by the end, this may not be a bad thing, because it made room for some fantastic developments towards the end of the season. But it just felt a little unfocused and uneven for much of it.So why the four star rating with all these complaints? It's very simple. Even at it's lowest quality, Buffy still offers a whole lot. There's still a lot of humour, action and quality drama to make this season great. Of course, it has the added bonus of the amazing musical episode Once More With Feeling, which is honestly just as good as people say.All in all, while the season offers many of the series' higher points, it also offers even more of its lower ones. Despite this, it goes without saying that if you're this far in, you have to keep watching. Even if only for the musical episode and the amazing shocks towards the end.",4,I'd Rank it as the Weakest Season.,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,1916,"[""'m"", 'only', 'relatively', 'new', 'fan', 'Buffy', 'was', 'only', 'year', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'picked', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'wanting', 'check', 'out', 'while', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'get', 'hooked', 'picked', 'up', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'doing', 'best', 'not', 'run', 'episodes', 'watch', 'reached', 'very', 'end.I', 'would', 'rank', 'two', 'favourite', 'seasons', 'being', '5', '7', 'think', 'were', 'truly', 'amazing', 'seasons', 'sandwiched', 'two', 'was', 'Season', '6', 'found', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'mixed', 'quality.I', 'suppose', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'aftereffects', 'events', 'season', '5', 'much', 'characters', 'seemed', 'well', 'just', 'little', 'off', 'Buffy', 'borderline', 'nymphomania', 'Spike', 'general', 'desertion', 'character', 'development', 'previous', 'season', 'various', 'other', 'character', 'choices', 'struck', 'odd', 'place.I', 'guess', 'issue', 'had', 'something', 'many', 'might', 'find', 'positive', 'sort', 'lacked', 'story', 'other', 'seasons', 'had', 'clear', 'threat', 'looming', 'overhead', 'Thing', 'end', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'made', 'room', 'fantastic', 'developments', 'end', 'season', 'just', 'felt', 'little', 'unfocused', 'uneven', 'much', 'it.So', 'why', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'complaints', 'very', 'simple', 'Even', 'lowest', 'quality', 'Buffy', 'still', 'whole', 'lot', 'still', 'lot', 'humour', 'action', 'quality', 'drama', 'make', 'season', 'great', 'course', 'added', 'bonus', 'amazing', 'musical', 'episode', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'honestly', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'people', 'say.All', 'season', 'many', 'series', 'higher', 'points', 'also', 'even', 'more', 'lower', 'ones', 'saying', ""'re"", 'far', 'have', 'keep', 'watching', 'Even', 'only', 'musical', 'episode', 'amazing', 'shocks', 'end']",N/A
