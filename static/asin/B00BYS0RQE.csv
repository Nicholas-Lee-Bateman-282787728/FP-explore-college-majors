1641203,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BYS0RQE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 9]","In the world of Lifetime movies, there are two basic genres. ONE: A woman triumphing over hardship, adversity, or abuse in a tough, but life affirming, ""based on real incidents"" TV docudrama. And TWO: The prurient ""ripped from the headline"" scandal or crime story that borrow from real cases and wallow in distasteful dramatic recreations. While I suppose, on some level, that the heartfelt examination of the widows of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, ""Betty and Coretta,"" fits into the first category, it could not be further from the formula filmmaking that the network is known for. And that's certainly a positive. Part of the network's programming for Black History Month, ""Betty and Coretta"" is structured as a docudrama that follows many years in the lives of both ladies.The great Angela Bassett plays Coretta Scott King and Mary J. Blige steps into the role of Dr. Betty Shabazz. Either lady (on their own) might have made for an interesting biography. So put together, the teleplay doesn't always get as close to its subjects as I would have liked. There simply isn't time to cover an adequate cross section in several decades worth of living for independent storylines. And truthfully, the two characters (both prominent figures) didn't really share much time together. Ruby Dee acts as the narrator of the piece which basically presents vignettes at different points in each woman's life. The timeline can rush forward and the actresses don't age appreciably throughout, so it can be somewhat disconcerting. Just as something fascinating is occurring, we are pushed ahead to the next ""significant moment."" As I said, I wanted the overall presentation to dig a little deeper as a character study, especially with this talented cast.Blige and Bassett both acquit themselves well and the film itself is earnest and meaningful. Despite its structural flaws and narrative gaps, it still tells a story that I was happy to partake in. For a Lifetime movie, this was a sizable and noteworthy undertaking and I wouldn't be surprised to see Bassett pop up in a few of next year's acting contests. There is no doubt that Betty Shabazz and Coretta Scott King are fascinating women who merit more attention. So while not perfect, I appreciate ""Betty and Coretta"" for shining a spotlight in their direction. I also thought it was nice to hear from Ruby Dee, herself a documented Civil Rights activist who knew both women. This may not be the definitive portrait of either lady, but it's a good introduction with some touching and inspirational moments.
