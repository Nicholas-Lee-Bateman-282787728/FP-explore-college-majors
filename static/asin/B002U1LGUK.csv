1289412,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B002U1LGUK,California Dreaming,"[6, 6]","From what I remember, it was Ted Bundy who coined the name ""Riverman"" for the killer of prostitutes in the Seattle area during the 70s and 80s.  I guess the name derived from the fact that the then unknown post-Bundy killer liked to dump his victims in the Green River.Not a bad name given by not such a good guy, but Cary Elwes is fantastic here as the supposedly nastiest serial killer in US history:  Ted Bundy.  Sure, there have been those that have killed more people, such as Gary Ridgeway -- the actual Riverman himself -- but few that have killed in such a violent fashion such as Bundy.  But while Bundy was indeed bad, Mr. Elwes is not, never devolving into caricature as he seems to invade the true psyche of Bundy in this film.  I gave the film ""Silence of the Lambs"" five stars, but I believe that Mr. Elwes was given more realistic dialog here than Anthony Hopkins in that award winning film, and this lesser known actor took advantage of it.I read the book ""The Riverman:  Ted Bundy and I Hunt for the Green River Killer"" quite awhile ago, and I gave it four stars.  In reality, I probably should have gone five (I may go back and up the rating) since it is easily the best true crime book that I've read to date, surely better than ""Stranger Beside Me"" by Ann Rule.  Dr. Robert Keppel did an excellent job describing the things that I'm looking for in the genre:  what was going on from an historical perspective at the time, what were the motivations of the killer, and how did the detectives catch the perpetrator.  Not only that, but Dr. Keppel seems to be not only objective -- after all, he gave even an evil guy like Bundy some kudos for helping catching Ridgeway -- but Dr. Keppel also seems to not be the ""gatekeeper"" type; he is willing to share his knowledge with others.A very good movie that was adapted from an excellent book.  A pretty big recommendation by me.",4,Cary Elwes better than Anthony Hopkins?,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,1891,"['what', 'remember', 'was', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'who', 'coined', 'name', 'Riverman', 'killer', 'prostitutes', 'Seattle', 'area', '70s', '80s', 'guess', 'name', 'derived', 'fact', 'then', 'unknown', 'post-Bundy', 'killer', 'liked', 'dump', 'victims', 'Green', 'River.Not', 'bad', 'name', 'given', 'not', 'good', 'guy', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'fantastic', 'here', 'supposedly', 'nastiest', 'serial', 'killer', 'US', 'history', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Sure', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'killed', 'more', 'people', 'such', 'Gary', 'Ridgeway', 'actual', 'Riverman', 'few', 'have', 'killed', 'such', 'violent', 'fashion', 'such', 'Bundy', 'Bundy', 'was', 'indeed', 'bad', 'Mr.', 'Elwes', 'not', 'never', 'devolving', 'caricature', 'invade', 'true', 'psyche', 'Bundy', 'film', 'gave', 'film', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'five', 'stars', 'believe', 'Mr.', 'Elwes', 'was', 'given', 'more', 'realistic', 'dialog', 'here', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'award', 'winning', 'film', 'lesser', 'known', 'actor', 'took', 'advantage', 'it.I', 'read', 'book', 'Riverman', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Hunt', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'quite', 'awhile', 'ago', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'reality', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'five', 'may', 'go', 'back', 'rating', 'easily', 'best', 'true', 'crime', 'book', ""'ve"", 'read', 'date', 'surely', 'better', 'Stranger', 'Beside', 'Me', 'Ann', 'Rule', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Keppel', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'describing', 'things', ""'m"", 'looking', 'genre', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'historical', 'perspective', 'time', 'were', 'motivations', 'killer', 'how', 'did', 'detectives', 'catch', 'perpetrator', 'Not', 'only', 'Dr.', 'Keppel', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'objective', 'gave', 'even', 'evil', 'guy', 'Bundy', 'kudos', 'helping', 'catching', 'Ridgeway', 'Dr.', 'Keppel', 'also', 'not', 'be', 'gatekeeper', 'type', 'willing', 'share', 'knowledge', 'others.A', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'excellent', 'book', 'pretty', 'big', 'recommendation']",The Riverman

1289414,A1JYFCI5TR09O8,B002U1LGUK,"CR Hawk ""Mr Vic""","[14, 14]","Recipe: Take Carry Elwes, Bruce Greenwood and Kathleen Quinlan, then add an interesting plot, stir all together for about 90 minutes and then enjoy the end product--a surprisingly good and tasty morsel of a movie.""The Riverman"" is based upon a well written fact based book by Robert Keppel, PhD, the man who interviewed Ted Bundy with the hopes of getting inside Bundy's mind in effort to help find the infamous Green River Killer.  The interviews aided the Washington state authorities in the apprehension of Gary Leon Ridgway for nearly 50 murders to a point, however, Keppel's talks with Bundy actually achieved more success in attaining Bundy's motives for his own killings, along with getting Bundy to add closure for several Washington families by confessing to several of the Seattle area's unsolved murders.This movie could easily have been called ""The Campus Killer Interviews"" or ""A Brief Look Inside the Mind of the Lady Killer"" since it was more about Bundy's interviews with Keppel, and not so much about Ridgway, aka the Green River Killer.  In fact, if you're looking for a portrayal or more indepth look at Ridgway, you can get hold of Uli Lommel's 2006 ""Green River Killer"" (not good, but OK) or one of the several bio DVD's available on Ridgway.No matter what the title of this movie is however, it is superb due to the excellent acting in the two lead roles:  Cary Elwes as Ted Bundy, who does a stupendous job at delving into the mind of Bundy and bringing it to the viewer; and Bruce Greenwood as Robert Keppel, who has the innate ability to get you to empathize with Keppel's inner and outer struggles in dealing with his link to two prolific serial killers he had the displeasure of hunting down.  Kathleen Quinlan, as usual, does a wonderful job in her small supporting role as Mrs Keppel.Contray to the title, if you're looking for a look at the Green River Killer's murders and a lot of action, you will have to look elsewhere; on the other hand, if you are looking for a good psychological drama with a brief, seemingly simple (yet actually quite complex) view of the inside of Ted Bundy's mind, then this flick is for you.",4,An Intriguing Look Inside the Mind of the Campus Killer,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,2150,"['Recipe', 'Take', 'Carry', 'Elwes', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'then', 'add', 'interesting', 'plot', 'stir', 'together', 'about', '90', 'minutes', 'then', 'enjoy', 'end', 'product', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'tasty', 'morsel', 'movie', 'Riverman', 'based', 'well', 'written', 'fact', 'based', 'book', 'Robert', 'Keppel', 'PhD', 'man', 'who', 'interviewed', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'hopes', 'getting', 'Bundy', 'mind', 'effort', 'help', 'find', 'infamous', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'interviews', 'aided', 'Washington', 'state', 'authorities', 'apprehension', 'Gary', 'Leon', 'Ridgway', 'nearly', '50', 'murders', 'point', 'however', 'Keppel', 'talks', 'Bundy', 'actually', 'achieved', 'more', 'success', 'attaining', 'Bundy', 'motives', 'own', 'killings', 'getting', 'Bundy', 'add', 'closure', 'several', 'Washington', 'families', 'confessing', 'several', 'Seattle', 'area', 'unsolved', 'murders.This', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Campus', 'Killer', 'Interviews', 'Brief', 'Look', 'Mind', 'Lady', 'Killer', 'was', 'more', 'Bundy', 'interviews', 'Keppel', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Ridgway', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'fact', ""'re"", 'looking', 'portrayal', 'more', 'indepth', 'look', 'Ridgway', 'can', 'get', 'hold', 'Uli', 'Lommel', '2006', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'not', 'good', 'OK', 'one', 'several', 'bio', 'DVD', 'available', 'Ridgway.No', 'matter', 'what', 'title', 'movie', 'however', 'superb', 'due', 'excellent', 'acting', 'two', 'lead', 'roles', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'who', 'stupendous', 'job', 'delving', 'mind', 'Bundy', 'bringing', 'viewer', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Robert', 'Keppel', 'who', 'innate', 'ability', 'get', 'empathize', 'Keppel', 'inner', 'outer', 'struggles', 'dealing', 'link', 'two', 'prolific', 'serial', 'killers', 'had', 'displeasure', 'hunting', 'down', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'usual', 'wonderful', 'job', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', 'Mrs', 'Keppel.Contray', 'title', ""'re"", 'looking', 'look', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'murders', 'lot', 'action', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'psychological', 'drama', 'brief', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'yet', 'actually', 'quite', 'complex', 'view', 'inside', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'mind', 'then', 'flick']",The Riverman

Second, this is a documentary on the Green River Killer, America's most prolific serial killer, and how he was apprehended as a result of an utterly harrowing, terrifying mind-merge between a real-life profiler and Ted Bundy, America's second most prolific and most notorious serial killer. There is otherwise no plot, characters or exploitation of the grisly and unique story. The book on which this film is based is the basis of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and the ""collaboration of one serial killer with police to identify another.""What distinguishes this film is the extraordinary, risky, dangerous, authentically evil performance of Bundy by Cary Elwes. Elwes was the male eye-candy star of ""Princess Bride"" and a series of romantic adventure films in his youth, when his own beauty and life experience must have taught him how prostitutes and ""johns"" engage in fantasy possession of another person's body and will. Elwes' powerful beauty faded fast, and he then made a series of poorly acted, shallow, often overplayed and embarrassing films. An actor he was not. But an amazingly intelligent, intuitive, deep-minded person with almost total access to the horrors which underlie such peculiar beauty and obsession as motivates reciprocal using of another person, from prostitution to serial killing, he is. If this is a ""performance"" of Ted Bundy, it is one of the greatest screen portrayals of direct empathy with evil I have ever seen. More likely this is a revelation of the deepest shames, angers, dangers, revenges and obsessions that possesses often incomprehensible or trivialized psycho-pathology by a man who knows it.The difference between the Cary Elwes of glamor fame, the Cary Elwes of ham actor distinction, and this Cary Elwes who ""is or becomes"" the most fully realistically portrayed sexual psychopath in film history is literally unimaginable. Make no mistake:-- this is not a good director getting the best from a second-rate actor. This is an amazing man (Elwes) revealing breadth and depth in serial killer psycho-pathology seen only by those professionals unlucky enough to meet the Real Thing. Yes, bravo Hopkins, Cox and even Hall for dramatic portrayal -- theater work an audience can leave in the theater. Elwes is something of an entirely different dimension of dark reality you will not soon if ever forget.I will never trash Cary Elwes' work again, though I cannot explain his shallow performances as a youth. Maybe he was just too intelligent and sensitive for the roles his charismatic beauty landed him in and how he was treated and used. I don't know. But somehow he brings real horror up and out of the depths of the human soul for all to see, and it makes me quite glad I never had the misfortune to underestimate the man to his face.",5,Excellent Performances of Real-Life Horror,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,2815,"['First', 'none', 'tags', 'apply', 'film', 'Second', 'documentary', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'America', 'most', 'prolific', 'serial', 'killer', 'how', 'was', 'apprehended', 'result', 'utterly', 'harrowing', 'terrifying', 'mind-merge', 'real-life', 'profiler', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'America', 'second', 'most', 'prolific', 'most', 'notorious', 'serial', 'killer', 'otherwise', 'plot', 'characters', 'exploitation', 'grisly', 'unique', 'story', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'basis', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'collaboration', 'one', 'serial', 'killer', 'police', 'identify', 'What', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'risky', 'dangerous', 'authentically', 'evil', 'performance', 'Bundy', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Elwes', 'was', 'male', 'eye-candy', 'star', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'series', 'romantic', 'adventure', 'films', 'youth', 'when', 'own', 'beauty', 'life', 'experience', 'must', 'have', 'taught', 'how', 'prostitutes', 'johns', 'engage', 'fantasy', 'possession', 'person', 'body', 'will', 'Elwes', 'powerful', 'beauty', 'faded', 'fast', 'then', 'made', 'series', 'poorly', 'acted', 'shallow', 'often', 'overplayed', 'embarrassing', 'films', 'actor', 'was', 'not', 'amazingly', 'intelligent', 'intuitive', 'deep-minded', 'person', 'almost', 'total', 'access', 'horrors', 'underlie', 'such', 'peculiar', 'beauty', 'obsession', 'motivates', 'reciprocal', 'using', 'person', 'prostitution', 'serial', 'killing', 'performance', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'one', 'greatest', 'screen', 'portrayals', 'direct', 'empathy', 'evil', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'More', 'likely', 'revelation', 'deepest', 'shames', 'angers', 'dangers', 'revenges', 'obsessions', 'often', 'incomprehensible', 'trivialized', 'psycho-pathology', 'man', 'who', 'it.The', 'difference', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'glamor', 'fame', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'ham', 'actor', 'distinction', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'who', 'becomes', 'most', 'fully', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'sexual', 'psychopath', 'film', 'history', 'literally', 'unimaginable', 'Make', 'mistake', 'not', 'good', 'director', 'getting', 'best', 'second-rate', 'actor', 'amazing', 'man', 'Elwes', 'revealing', 'breadth', 'depth', 'serial', 'killer', 'psycho-pathology', 'seen', 'only', 'professionals', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'meet', 'Real', 'Thing', 'Yes', 'bravo', 'Hopkins', 'Cox', 'even', 'Hall', 'dramatic', 'portrayal', 'theater', 'work', 'audience', 'can', 'leave', 'theater', 'Elwes', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'dimension', 'dark', 'reality', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'ever', 'forget.I', 'will', 'never', 'trash', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'work', 'again', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'shallow', 'performances', 'youth', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'roles', 'charismatic', 'beauty', 'landed', 'how', 'was', 'treated', 'used', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'somehow', 'real', 'horror', 'up', 'depths', 'human', 'soul', 'see', 'quite', 'glad', 'never', 'had', 'misfortune', 'underestimate', 'man', 'face']",The Riverman

1289425,A3V79KXIY09MOE,B002U1LGUK,"Stacy ""Amazon Junkie""","[2, 2]","The Green River killer, who stalked the red light district of Seattle-Tacoma in the 80s and 90s, eluded police for so long that one of the lead investigators followed up on a letter sent to him. What made this letter, a whopping 22 pages long, so special was the name of the sender; the writer had eluded the grasp of this same detective before. That man was Ted Bundy.This movie is based upon a book written by Bob Keppel, and everything in the above paragraph happened in real life. After the Green River killer was apprehended in 2001, Keppel sat down to write a book about his experience in tracking the killer and how he came to Florida to interview another notorious killer who offered his input to help catch TGRK (for short). While the book covers more detail about the investigation's evolution over time, the movie &#34;The Riverman&#34; focuses on the actions of Ted Bundy during the final days of his life.The Syopsis&#34;The Riverman&#34; is a drama that details how one investigator worked on the case of the Green River Killer, as well as his personal life and how his work affected his family. The pace of the movie is sluggish at first; it begins with an inner monologue by Keppel while he is washing his car and his children are playing around nearby. He is a man who is haunted by images of the bodies of murder victims, as well as him not being able to &#34;catch&#34; Ted Bundy earlier in his career. He is now a Captain on the police force, and while not formally a member of TGRK's Task Force, he is very interested in capturing the culprit; the lead detective on the case is a good friend and former student, and he uses this connection to learn details about the ongoing investigation.While the movie does a good job of introducing characters, it is frustrating in its focus. The primary plot concerns the fact that Ted Bundy, of his own volition, wrote a letter to Mr. Keppel offering his advice in order to catch the killer. From there we see that Mr. Keppel joins an expanded task force, and along with his friend and fellow investigator Dave Reichert. The performances by both characters are unbalanced, and with a plot that doesn't really have a &#34;high&#34; point, you end up with the confusion of what it is that the detectives are after.For his part, Cary Elwes (who plays Ted Bundy) does a great job at portraying the deviousness of Ted Bundy; being creepy enough to lead you to truly see the evil of a man who brutally killed roughly 30 women. As such you are never quite sure what the motivation was; Bundy hints at things that he wants (namely putting a stay on his execution), but is also very talkative with the detectives. Slowly, the movie evolves into a different story: the Green River Killer investigation suddenly becomes tangential to the narcissism of Bundy, and how his opinions of who TGRK is suddenly transition into a deeper meaning.Final SayThis movie is more of a documentary, detailing an aspect of a real-life serial killer investigation and throwing in family strife to offset the darkness. While I felt that the detectives were directionless at times, eventually the movie picks up and renders both of the detectives in a positive light. The performance by Elwes is excellent, and the scenes with Bruce Greenwood (Keppel) show a definite chemistry in their banter. While the plot is somewhat anticlimactic, it is still interesting to see the interviews with Bundy, especially when you consider just how accurate his &#34;suggestions&#34; were. If you want a snuggle movie that is based on fact, this is a great title. Just don't expect any explosions, brutal violence, or action.",3,It Takes One to Know One,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,3638,"['Green', 'River', 'killer', 'who', 'stalked', 'red', 'light', 'district', 'Seattle-Tacoma', '80s', '90s', 'eluded', 'police', 'so', 'long', 'one', 'lead', 'investigators', 'followed', 'up', 'letter', 'sent', 'What', 'made', 'letter', 'whopping', '22', 'pages', 'long', 'special', 'was', 'name', 'sender', 'writer', 'had', 'eluded', 'grasp', 'same', 'detective', 'man', 'was', 'Ted', 'Bundy.This', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'Bob', 'Keppel', 'everything', 'above', 'paragraph', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'Green', 'River', 'killer', 'was', 'apprehended', '2001', 'Keppel', 'sat', 'down', 'write', 'book', 'experience', 'tracking', 'killer', 'how', 'came', 'Florida', 'interview', 'notorious', 'killer', 'who', 'offered', 'input', 'help', 'catch', 'TGRK', 'short', 'book', 'more', 'detail', 'investigation', 'evolution', 'time', 'movie', '34', 'Riverman', '34', 'focuses', 'actions', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'final', 'days', 'life.The', 'Syopsis', '34', 'Riverman', '34', 'drama', 'details', 'how', 'one', 'investigator', 'worked', 'case', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'life', 'how', 'work', 'affected', 'family', 'pace', 'movie', 'sluggish', 'first', 'inner', 'monologue', 'Keppel', 'washing', 'car', 'children', 'are', 'playing', 'nearby', 'man', 'who', 'haunted', 'images', 'bodies', 'murder', 'victims', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'being', 'able', '34', 'catch', '34', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'earlier', 'career', 'now', 'Captain', 'police', 'force', 'not', 'formally', 'member', 'TGRK', 'Task', 'Force', 'very', 'interested', 'capturing', 'culprit', 'lead', 'detective', 'case', 'good', 'friend', 'former', 'student', 'connection', 'learn', 'details', 'ongoing', 'investigation.While', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'introducing', 'characters', 'frustrating', 'focus', 'primary', 'plot', 'fact', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'own', 'volition', 'wrote', 'letter', 'Mr.', 'Keppel', 'offering', 'advice', 'order', 'catch', 'killer', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Keppel', 'expanded', 'task', 'force', 'friend', 'fellow', 'investigator', 'Dave', 'Reichert', 'performances', 'characters', 'are', 'unbalanced', 'plot', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', '34', 'high', '34', 'point', 'end', 'up', 'confusion', 'what', 'detectives', 'are', 'after.For', 'part', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'who', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'deviousness', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'being', 'creepy', 'enough', 'lead', 'truly', 'see', 'evil', 'man', 'who', 'brutally', 'killed', 'roughly', '30', 'women', 'such', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'motivation', 'was', 'Bundy', 'hints', 'things', 'namely', 'putting', 'stay', 'execution', 'also', 'very', 'talkative', 'detectives', 'Slowly', 'movie', 'different', 'story', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'investigation', 'suddenly', 'tangential', 'narcissism', 'Bundy', 'how', 'opinions', 'who', 'TGRK', 'suddenly', 'transition', 'deeper', 'meaning.Final', 'SayThis', 'movie', 'more', 'documentary', 'detailing', 'aspect', 'real-life', 'serial', 'killer', 'investigation', 'throwing', 'family', 'strife', 'offset', 'darkness', 'felt', 'detectives', 'were', 'directionless', 'times', 'eventually', 'movie', 'up', 'renders', 'detectives', 'positive', 'light', 'performance', 'Elwes', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Keppel', 'show', 'definite', 'chemistry', 'banter', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'anticlimactic', 'still', 'interesting', 'see', 'interviews', 'Bundy', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'just', 'how', 'accurate', '34', 'suggestions', '34', 'were', 'want', 'snuggle', 'movie', 'based', 'fact', 'great', 'title', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'explosions', 'brutal', 'violence', 'action']",The Riverman
