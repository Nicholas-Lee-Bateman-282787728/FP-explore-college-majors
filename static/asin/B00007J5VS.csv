729294,A209RUTIWGY3E8,B00007J5VS,MagePro,"[1, 1]","This movie ""A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court""(1949) takes an amazing book by Samuel Clemens and mixes in Bing Crosby's soothing baritone and style, Rhonda Flemming's... everything, and William Bendix's comedy to create a mood that you just can't shake even hours after the movie is over. Despite some of the musical style being a bit dated and one song in particular (I won't mention which one) that could have been removed from the movie, it couldn't spoil the atmosphere created.Based on Clemens book that was published in 1989, the main character, Hank Martin was moved up in time to a date of 1910 with the on-onslaught of the horseless carriage. This didn't spoil the story, but enhanced the separation of the times presented. The comedy was well played and set a model that other writers use today. The 'special' effects were kept to a minimum and the story was focused on. Unlike the later productions put out by others including Disney, it can stand on its own as a classic.Overall, as I love time travel stories, I found this one to be more entertaining than appealing to my science/fiction inner geek. Of the set, this one was the better movie and has kept in the back of my mind since I saw it as a kid in the 60's.""The Emperor Waltz"" (1948) was a nice re-introduction to the Bing Crosby personality. The role of Virgil Smith was almost written just for Bing. The overall story was shortened to fit within the time constraints. This made one scene a bit cramped as Joan Fontaine's character, Johanna Augusta Franziska who was very aloof and cold, suddenly melts away in a matter of 30 seconds. If sources are correct, Bing was very heavy-handed in the production of this movie. While it is evident where and how it was manipulated, the humorisk style of Crosby will win out.If allowed to rate separate, ""The Emperor Waltz"" would have only rated 3 stars.

Unfortunately the script is rarely very witty despite the Wilder-Charles Brackett pedigree and Bing Crosby and an unflatteringly photographed Joan Fontaine have almost zero screen chemistry, their hatred for much of the movie far more convincing than their inevitable romance. The real triumphs of this Viennese romance between a travelling salesman and an aristocrat are the lavish production design and the gorgeous Technicolor photography that are occasionally impressive enough to take your mind off what's happening in the paper-thin story. Still, the dancing chauffeur is fun.More successful by far is A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It's not a particularly good picture anymore than it's a particularly bad one: it's lavishly staged in Technicolor with a decent cast and inoffensive but, with one exception, unmemorable songs. But it does have one of cinema's great moments of delight, as Bing, William Bendix (one of film noir's greatest thugs here cast in a very different guise as a blustering knight) and Sir Cedric Hardwicke's elderly King Arthur join forces for the delightful 'Busy Doing Nothing' - which is more than worth the price on its own.The two films are gorgeously restored, boasting great color and definition, though the only extra is the original trailer for Yankee.",3,"No classics, but a satisfying double-bill",1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,1455,"['Emperor', 'Waltz', 'unenviable', 'reputation', 'being', 'regarded', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'worst', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'good', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'bad', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'rarely', 'very', 'witty', 'Wilder-Charles', 'Brackett', 'pedigree', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'unflatteringly', 'photographed', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'have', 'almost', 'zero', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'hatred', 'much', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'convincing', 'inevitable', 'romance', 'real', 'triumphs', 'Viennese', 'romance', 'travelling', 'salesman', 'aristocrat', 'are', 'lavish', 'production', 'design', 'gorgeous', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'are', 'occasionally', 'impressive', 'enough', 'take', 'mind', 'what', 'happening', 'paper-thin', 'story', 'Still', 'dancing', 'chauffeur', 'fun.More', 'successful', 'far', 'Connecticut', 'Yankee', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Court', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'picture', 'anymore', 'particularly', 'bad', 'one', 'lavishly', 'staged', 'Technicolor', 'decent', 'cast', 'inoffensive', 'one', 'exception', 'unmemorable', 'songs', 'have', 'one', 'cinema', 'great', 'moments', 'delight', 'Bing', 'William', 'Bendix', 'one', 'film', 'noir', 'greatest', 'thugs', 'here', 'cast', 'very', 'different', 'guise', 'blustering', 'knight', 'Sir', 'Cedric', 'Hardwicke', 'elderly', 'King', 'Arthur', 'join', 'forces', 'delightful', ""'Busy"", 'Doing', 'Nothing', 'more', 'price', 'own.The', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'gorgeously', 'restored', 'boasting', 'great', 'color', 'definition', 'only', 'extra', 'original', 'trailer', 'Yankee']",N/A

Lynch ""vtl""","[42, 52]","...you'd think this would be a winner -- Bing Crosby at the height of his film popularity, Billy Wilder as director, and the lush scenery of Canada's Japser National Park.  However, despite the truly beautiful restoration by Universal, this is a yawn...and I'm a bit of a Crosby fan.  Here, Bing plays a phonograph salesman trying to sell his wares to Austrian royalty.  He falls in love with Joan Fontaine, a countess, while his dog falls in love with her dog, who is supposed to mate with the Emperor's dog.  The scenery is just beautiful.  The script is ho hum.  I sat thinking how could this be Billy Wilder???  Well, I guess the concept is rather anti-class system, so perhaps that's what attracted Wilder.  Aside from that, it's fluff...albeit pleasant fluff.On the other hand, &quot;A Connecticutt Yankee In King Arthur's Court&quot; is much nicer.  A nice turn on the old story, with a hoot of a supporting performance by William Bendix (&quot;Life Of Riley&quot;).  Crosby is in fine voice and this film has a bit of a heart to it.
