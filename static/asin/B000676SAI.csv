862000,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B000676SAI,CPTScott,"[5, 5]","Having done all four workouts included on the dvd I can say that overall I'm happy that I added these to my collection.The first two workouts combine kickboxing and step moves. I'd never done this type of combination before and I found this combination to be really interesting and challenging.Even though I was ""all over the place"" trying to do some of the step moves I must admit it was actually fun (and would have probably been pretty entertaining to watch if someone saw me flailing away in my den:)).I wanted to mention that you don't actually need a step to do these workouts (and I don't currently own one) because there's one exerciser showing the moves without a step. I actually used my Yoga mat as a visual reference and stepped on that in place of a step. This worked well because it being my first time doing these workouts I'd probably have fallen off of a step :)The workouts themselves were very well designed overall but unfortunately they are marred by moments of REALLY stupid camera work! From time to time the camera people focus on a close up of an exerciser or scenery when a new move was being introduced. ""Stupid"" is the best way I can describe that and I can't even begin to imagine what they were thinking while they were filming! :)Still, it accounts for only a small percentage of the overall workouts. Certainly they were extremely frustrating moments but I just kept moving until I could ""catch up"" and this was more of an issue in the first two (kick box/step) rather than the last two (kickboxing only) workouts.In spite of the occasional camera foolishness, the workouts themselves are really great and creative!The kickboxing-only workouts, which are the 3rd and 4th programs on the dvd are well worth the low cost of the dvd even if you don't ever use the kick box/step programs. They are non-stop, fun, challenging and high energy.The design of the program was great in the way Shelley led you from the warm ups to the Kickbox type moves to cardio segments (and occasional squats on the Kickbox 1 segment as well). Of course being from a TV show there transitions between commercials aren't always seamless but it's not a big deal either.So I guess I'd say that if you are a fan of the Caribbean workout programs (which I have been for a while, I really love the three Pilates discs I have) then you'll probably enjoy this one as well! Just don't expect perfection in terms of the  camera work or transitions between commercials and you'll probably find they are really worthwhile in terms of the time spent doing them (only about 22 minutes) and certainly worth the cost.!",3,"Great, Short, Kickboxing Workouts Marred By AWFUL Camera Work",1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,2611,"['Having', 'done', 'four', 'workouts', 'included', 'dvd', 'can', 'say', 'overall', ""'m"", 'happy', 'added', 'collection.The', 'first', 'two', 'workouts', 'combine', 'kickboxing', 'step', 'moves', ""'d"", 'never', 'done', 'type', 'combination', 'found', 'combination', 'be', 'really', 'interesting', 'challenging.Even', 'was', 'place', 'trying', 'do', 'step', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'actually', 'fun', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'someone', 'saw', 'flailing', 'away', 'den', 'wanted', 'mention', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'need', 'step', 'do', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'currently', 'own', 'one', 'one', 'exerciser', 'showing', 'moves', 'step', 'actually', 'used', 'Yoga', 'mat', 'visual', 'reference', 'stepped', 'place', 'step', 'worked', 'well', 'being', 'first', 'time', 'doing', 'workouts', ""'d"", 'probably', 'have', 'fallen', 'step', 'workouts', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'designed', 'overall', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'marred', 'moments', 'REALLY', 'stupid', 'camera', 'work', 'time', 'time', 'camera', 'people', 'focus', 'close', 'exerciser', 'scenery', 'when', 'new', 'move', 'was', 'being', 'introduced', 'Stupid', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'imagine', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'were', 'filming', 'Still', 'only', 'small', 'percentage', 'overall', 'workouts', 'Certainly', 'were', 'extremely', 'frustrating', 'moments', 'just', 'kept', 'moving', 'could', 'catch', 'up', 'was', 'more', 'issue', 'first', 'two', 'kick', 'box/step', 'rather', 'last', 'two', 'kickboxing', 'only', 'workouts.In', 'spite', 'occasional', 'camera', 'foolishness', 'workouts', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'creative', 'kickboxing-only', 'workouts', 'are', '3rd', '4th', 'programs', 'dvd', 'are', 'well', 'low', 'cost', 'dvd', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'use', 'kick', 'box/step', 'programs', 'are', 'non-stop', 'fun', 'challenging', 'high', 'energy.The', 'design', 'program', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'Shelley', 'led', 'warm', 'ups', 'Kickbox', 'type', 'moves', 'cardio', 'segments', 'occasional', 'squats', 'Kickbox', '1', 'segment', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'being', 'TV', 'show', 'transitions', 'commercials', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'seamless', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'either.So', 'guess', ""'d"", 'say', 'are', 'fan', 'Caribbean', 'workout', 'programs', 'have', 'been', 'while', 'really', 'love', 'three', 'Pilates', 'discs', 'have', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'perfection', 'terms', 'camera', 'work', 'transitions', 'commercials', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'are', 'really', 'worthwhile', 'terms', 'time', 'spent', 'doing', 'only', 'about', '22', 'minutes', 'certainly', 'cost']",Kickboxing

Shelly McDonald is one of the best fitness instructors in the business. She is definitely one of my favorites. Shelly, her co-hosts Joanna and Carolyn, and the Caribbean scenery are eye candy. Shelly is always having fun and she wants her viewers to follow suit. I get a terrific workout every time I put this DVD on. I sweat a lot when I work out with Shelly. I also own the aerobics DVD and that one is fantastic, too.

862004,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B000676SAI,Sheri in Reho,"[26, 26]","There are four kickboxing workouts to choose from on this DVD--two that include an aerobic step and two that do not.  I am already quite familiar with kickboxing moves, having used Tae-Bo Cardio, the 10-Minute Solution Kickbox Bootcamp and a Quickfix Kickbox workout.  Because the cueing (letting you know what move is coming next) is inconsistent, there were times I had to march in place until I could figure out what I was supposed to do.  I found the choreography in the step workout especially confounding and, considering I'm very familiar with kickboxing, I don't think that's a good sign (how is a person new to kickboxing supposed to keep up?).What makes it worse is that there are times when you are transitioning to a new move and you can hear her describing it but, instead of the camera person showing you their full bodies (or at least their feet so you can see what to do), he/she is busy zooming in on one of the exerciser's faces or chest.  I found this beyond obnoxious.  I had done one Caribbean Workout previously, so I knew to expect the cut-outs where the commercials were when it aired on FitTV.  However, I don't remember that workout feeling so disjointed when the ""blackouts"" cut out and back in as it was in this workout.  At least once, it even came back to different music...and every time it came back, they were on a different foot than I was so I had to stop to get back in step with them.  Not a HUGE deal, but annoying.  Also, while the Barbados locations certainly make for a pretty aesthetic, I really wish they would wait for a time when you're in a long period of repetition before they go off filming the waves and such...not being able to see the person you're supposed to be following is really disruptive, especially during a transition to another move.What I did love was a lot of punching and kicking, and the step workouts were an especially good workout.  I don't think I would do the step workout again, because I felt that the step took away from the feel of kickboxing (not to mention the confusing choreography).While I really enjoyed portions of the non-step workout, I am glad that I didn't buy this DVD.",3,"Versatile and pretty, but not my favorite.",1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,2156,"['are', 'four', 'kickboxing', 'workouts', 'choose', 'DVD', 'two', 'include', 'aerobic', 'step', 'two', 'do', 'not', 'am', 'already', 'quite', 'familiar', 'kickboxing', 'moves', 'having', 'used', 'Tae-Bo', 'Cardio', '10-Minute', 'Solution', 'Kickbox', 'Bootcamp', 'Quickfix', 'Kickbox', 'workout', 'cueing', 'letting', 'know', 'what', 'move', 'coming', 'next', 'inconsistent', 'were', 'times', 'had', 'march', 'place', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'found', 'choreography', 'step', 'workout', 'especially', 'confounding', 'considering', ""'m"", 'very', 'familiar', 'kickboxing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'sign', 'how', 'person', 'new', 'kickboxing', 'supposed', 'keep', 'up', 'worse', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'are', 'transitioning', 'new', 'move', 'can', 'hear', 'describing', 'instead', 'camera', 'person', 'showing', 'full', 'bodies', 'least', 'feet', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'do', 'busy', 'zooming', 'one', 'exerciser', 'chest', 'found', 'obnoxious', 'had', 'done', 'one', 'Caribbean', 'Workout', 'previously', 'knew', 'expect', 'cut-outs', 'where', 'commercials', 'were', 'when', 'aired', 'FitTV', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'workout', 'feeling', 'so', 'disjointed', 'when', 'blackouts', 'cut', 'out', 'back', 'was', 'workout', 'least', 'once', 'even', 'came', 'back', 'different', 'music', 'time', 'came', 'back', 'were', 'different', 'foot', 'was', 'so', 'had', 'stop', 'get', 'back', 'step', 'Not', 'HUGE', 'deal', 'annoying', 'Also', 'Barbados', 'locations', 'certainly', 'make', 'pretty', 'aesthetic', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'wait', 'time', 'when', ""'re"", 'long', 'period', 'repetition', 'go', 'off', 'filming', 'waves', 'such', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'person', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'following', 'really', 'disruptive', 'especially', 'transition', 'move.What', 'did', 'love', 'was', 'lot', 'punching', 'kicking', 'step', 'workouts', 'were', 'especially', 'good', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'do', 'step', 'workout', 'again', 'felt', 'step', 'took', 'away', 'feel', 'kickboxing', 'not', 'mention', 'confusing', 'choreography', '.While', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'portions', 'non-step', 'workout', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD']",Kickboxing
862005,ATKVDKXO3Q6ZM,B000676SAI,Teedums,"[11, 11]","I have seen bits and pieces of these workouts on Fit TV, and thought I would get the DVD's.  These are a great bargain, you get 4 - 20 minute workouts.  Two of them use a step, the other two do not.  Although the two workouts that do use a step, one of the background exercisers does not use a step so you can follow along with her if you do not have a step or do not feel comfortable using one.  You will still get a good workout without a step.  I often do cardio following my strength workouts so these are nice as add-ons, or just on there own.  Plus they are short enough that you could do 2 or 3 of them if you wanted to.Each workout contains a brief warmup and cooldown, and there arebrief commercial breaks where the screen goes black, but it is for just seconds, not too distracting.  The routines are fun and easy to follow, lots of punches and kicks, some in combination with step moves for the workouts that call for a step.  Some of the moves you will see in all the workouts, which might bother some but didn't bother me at all.Shelly McDonald lead the workouts and she is joined by Carolyn and Joanna.  All three of them are in great shape.  Shelly is a friendly instructor with lots of enthusiasm, and seems to be having a good time.  She is good about including the background exercisers in conversation and makes it look as if she is working out with her friends.  It seems like a nice atmosphere which draws me in and I have a good time along with them.  The workouts are filmed in Barbados at various locations, on the beach or at the Sugar Hill Resort poolside that overlooks the ocean.  The scenery is worth the price of the workouts alone.These would be more suitable for those already familiar with kickboxing as there isn't much explanation on how to do the moves, but those advanced would likely find these workouts too easy.  But they are lots of fun, the music energetic, great deal for the price.
