Dazed &amp; Confused was more mainstream and The Stoned age was more like a cult classic. Dazed and Confused was a smarter type of humor flick. The Stoned age is a dumb humor flick. Think of it this way. Pissing in someones ice cube tray=Stoned age, pouring paint on the head of a jackass for revenge=Dazed &amp; Confused. Two different types of movies but both are very funny and well made. Both soundtracks are great also. BOC was rocking just as hard and just as good as most of the bands on the D&amp;C soundtrack.

465613,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6305468508,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 6]","&quot;The Stoned Age&quot; followed on the heels of the immensely interesting &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; doubtless in an effort to cash in on the cultic success of that film. Both films deal with the perennial problems of the stoner, those largely ignored characters you saw shuffling through the halls of high school in a perpetual stupor. Usually, these hep cats had hair down to their ankles, giggled a lot, and managed to work the word &quot;man&quot; into every sentence they uttered. Everyone knew what these guys and gals were up to, even the teachers, but by an almost unspoken agreement everyone left them alone (unless they blatantly broke the rules). Hollywood has a sort of love affair with these affable losers, and even went so far as to have Sean Penn immortalize the stoner in the memorable early 1980's effort &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High.&quot; Yep, the stoner is here to stay, folks, even if a few years go by without us seeing one of them in a film. If nothing else, the ability to get some cheap laughs out of fried brain cells insures the character's longevity. &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; is stoner humor at its absolute dumbest.Still, the movie has its charms. &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; follows the misadventures of two longhaired losers, Joe and Hubbs, on one of their nightly excursions around town. The two guys drive a car all dolled up with Blue Oyster Cult graphics (amateurishly done, of course) looking for babes, parties, and mind-altering chemicals. In the course of their quest, they encounter a whole host of offbeat characters. The most memorable of these dolts is Tack, a pimpled goof who has all the appeal of a speed bump. The guy picks his nose, whines incessantly, and generally makes a total fool of himself. Tack will reappear throughout the movie like an unpleasant rash, but the first time Joe and Hubbs meet up with him they learn a wonderful secret. It seems that the local thug plans on partying with two gorgeous babes in a house on the outskirts of town. When our two heroes pry this information out of Tack, they decided to take matters into their own hands. The girls do turn out to be hot, but problem after problem nearly thwarts Joe and Hubbs efforts right from the start. One of the girls wants a jug of liquor before she will let the guys in the door, an item difficult to obtain when you are a minor. Then there are all of the guys in town who learn about the party and want to horn in on Joe and Hubbs. Throw in some cops, the father of one of the girls who suddenly comes home in a rage, some ugly chicks, and you just now the antics will unfold at a frantic pace.When &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; works, it works very well. Tack is an amusing character instantly familiar to anyone who lived this sort of lifestyle back in high school. He's the guy always trying to ingratiate himself in the activities of others even though no one wants him around unless he has something useful to contribute. I laughed at the cop who always gave the kids the same line about how he used to like to party when he was young. I even liked looking at the girls, especially the hyper cynical Jill (played by Grace Slick's daughter China Kantner) although I didn't understand the constant comments about her being &quot;ugly.&quot; Taylor Negron and Jake Busey turn up in small but funny roles as a disco dancing liquor store clerk and a preppie party host respectively. The actors who play Joe and Hubbs do an effective if slightly over the top turn as the two wacked out stoners. All of the characters embody many funny yet occasionally uncomfortable truths about that extremely awkward age of roughly fifteen to twenty.What I didn't care for about the movie centers on Joe's metaphysical experiences at a Blue Oyster Cult concert. Every so often one of the character's allude to a part of the concert where a laser light hit Joe right in the face, which led to some strange out of body experience. We see what happened at the end of the film in a decidedly unfunny flashback sequence that borrows heavily from Kubrick's &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot; Yeah, I understand how important music is to teenage kids under the influence--my poison was Rush and Pink Floyd--but I felt a bit let down with Joe's BOC experience. Listening to Joe attempt to explain his experience is amusing, especially when we see the reactions of the people listening to him, but overall the idea fails. Furthermore, I quickly tired of Hubbs's hyper aggressive personality. Again, I knew a few people exactly like this character, the jerk always looking for a fight with anyone in a vain attempt to make up for some feelings of inadequacy. The problem here is that it is just overdone and soon becomes unfunny and banal.I have criticized a few central aspects of the film, but I cannot bash the movie too much. &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; is a funny, mindless film everyone should watch at least once. Heck, the puke scene is worth the price of admission alone. Sadly, the DVD edition lacks a lot of extras even as it offers a widescreen picture transfer. &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is definitely the better of the two, however, if for no other reason than that movie attempts to temper its hijinks with a deeply reflective timbre. If you just want to laugh and forget about it the next day, &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; is the way to go.",4,"Crude, crass, and ultimately amusing",1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,5371,"['quot',

Yeah, not too deep, but can't you identify with at least part of the concept?This movie has so much great dialogue that I cannot even start to get into it, as I'll go on all night.The director and co-writer commentary is outstanding. Every saying, character nickname, song selection has a story behind it. I'm surprised James Melkonian, the director has not been involved in more projects.This movie blows away 9/10 teen movies since 1982 easily.What can I say about the cast of characters (where did they come up with these guys): Tack, Dixie Cup Dean, Lanie, Mike Dick, Mike New York, Hanky, Jill's Dad, Crump's Brother, The Narly Eyeball, The Samoan Dude. It goes on and on...The music is great, even though they couldn't afford the Zeppelin/The Who tunes. Black Sabbath, Montrose, T-Rex, and of course BOC make this movie great.The dvd case has a reviewer quoted as saying ""Better than Dazed and Confused"".

465621,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,6305468508,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[15, 17]","I saw this in the theater(yup, it actually had a theatrical release for a day or so) at the perfect age-17.  Anyone who went to high school can recall the years of 16 and 17 to be the years of that mindless activity called ""cruising""(of course, I know some losers in their 30s who continue to do this, I'm sure you do too).  At that age you could drive, but you couldn't buy cigarettes, liquor or get into a bar, so what could you do?  Go cruising!  The idea was to meet girls with varying degrees of success.  If you can relate to that, you'll get some degree of entertainment from The Stoned Age which starts off with this premise.  This film is over exaggerated but ironically very realistic at the same time.  Everyone knew someone like Tack-some annoying schmuck who would usually find his way into your car somehow.  Everyone's also ended up at a party thrown by a bunch of idiots from a totally different ""class"" or ""scene"" than you. And who didn't know a couple of ""Buffalo Chicks?"" If you were one of those guys who took the ""nice guy"" approach to getting women, you'll totally identify with Joe.  You can literally feel his frustration as he desperately attempts to woo the amazingly sexy Laney, only to have her jump in the sack with a sexist jerk who seduces her through...well....acting like a jerk.  If you were a womanizing jerk like Hubbs, then you'll relive fond memories as you watch him get the chick through the most juvenile tactics available.  I didn't grow up in the 70s, but it was the perfect setting for this film.  The lingo is accurate, the music great, and the issues and concepts are still relevant today;  The rich disco kids and their hatred for the lower/middle class hard rock stoners for example.  Cruising, of course. People should really stop the comparisons to Dazed and Confused.  That quote on the box was a bad idea, the director even says so in the commentary track!  Two different films, folks.  The only thing they have in common is the time period and some stoner characters.  Would you compare Monty Python and The Holy Grail to Excalibur coz they take place in the same time period and have a few similar themes?  Back to the music I mentioned before, I was very impressed with the soundtrack.  In the commentary, the director mentions that this whole film was to be strictly Led Zeppelin songs, but it couldn't be done financially.  Thank God for that!  That would have been way too cliche.  This movie works so much better with a soundtrack with no Led Zeppelin.  God forbid there were other bands in the 70s other than Zeppelin, alot of them better, believe it or not.  In this film we get songs by Ted Nugent, Deep Purple, Focus, Montrose, references to the Scorpions, and The Blue Oyster Cult takes center stage.  That's cool coz BOC don't get the respect they deserve anymore.  The cast of unknowns does a decent enough job.  I'm not sure why the character of Jill is refered to as an ""oinker"" and ""hoagley"".  Throughout the film, we keep getting reinforced the notion that Jill is supposed to be unattractive.  Well, just watch the film and see if you think Jill is unattractive.  Sure, maybe she doesn't leap off the screen like Laney, but she is one good looking woman.  Of course, Laney is always dressed skimpy while Jill is isn't.  Jill also looks the most 70s, Laney doesn't.  Anyhow, this film is a sure gem to discover if you did the cruising thing in high school or were a teenager in the 70s.  Also, to really enjoy this, totally disregard that Dazed and Confused quote on the box.",5,Just Cruisin',1086480000,"06 6, 2004",2004,3545,"['saw', 'theater', 'yup', 'actually', 'had', 'theatrical', 'release', 'day', 'so', 'perfect', 'age-17', 'Anyone', 'who', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'can', 'recall', 'years', '16', '17', 'be', 'years', 'mindless', 'activity', 'called', 'cruising', 'course', 'know', 'losers', '30s', 'who', 'continue', 'do', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', 'too', 'age', 'could', 'drive', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'cigarettes', 'liquor', 'get', 'bar', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'Go', 'cruising', 'idea', 'was', 'meet', 'girls', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'can', 'relate', ""'ll"", 'get', 'degree', 'entertainment', 'Stoned', 'Age', 'premise', 'film', 'exaggerated', 'ironically', 'very', 'realistic', 'same', 'time', 'Everyone', 'knew', 'someone', 'Tack-some', 'annoying', 'schmuck', 'who', 'would', 'usually', 'find', 'way', 'car', 'somehow', 'Everyone', 'also', 'ended', 'up', 'party', 'thrown', 'bunch', 'idiots', 'totally', 'different', 'class', 'scene', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'couple', 'Buffalo', 'Chicks', 'were', 'one', 'guys', 'who', 'took', 'nice', 'guy', 'approach', 'getting', 'women', ""'ll"", 'totally', 'identify', 'Joe', 'can', 'literally', 'feel', 'frustration', 'desperately', 'woo', 'amazingly', 'sexy', 'Laney', 'only', 'have', 'jump', 'sack', 'sexist', 'jerk', 'who', 'well', '.acting', 'jerk', 'were', 'womanizing', 'jerk', 'Hubbs', 'then', ""'ll"", 'relive', 'fond', 'memories', 'watch', 'get', 'chick', 'most', 'juvenile', 'tactics', 'available', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', '70s', 'was', 'perfect', 'setting', 'film', 'lingo', 'accurate', 'music', 'great', 'issues', 'concepts', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'rich', 'disco', 'kids', 'hatred', 'lower/middle', 'class', 'hard', 'rock', 'stoners', 'example', 'Cruising', 'course', 'People', 'should', 'really', 'stop', 'comparisons', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'quote', 'box', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'director', 'even', 'so', 'commentary', 'track', 'Two', 'different', 'films', 'folks', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'time', 'period', 'stoner', 'characters', 'Would', 'compare', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Excalibur', 'coz', 'take', 'place', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'have', 'few', 'similar', 'themes', 'Back', 'music', 'mentioned', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'soundtrack', 'commentary', 'director', 'mentions', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'be', 'strictly', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'songs', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'financially', 'Thank', 'God', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'too', 'cliche', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'soundtrack', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'God', 'forbid', 'were', 'other', 'bands', '70s', 'other', 'Zeppelin', 'alot', 'better', 'believe', 'not', 'film', 'get', 'songs', 'Ted', 'Nugent', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'Focus', 'Montrose', 'Scorpions', 'Blue', 'Oyster', 'Cult', 'center', 'stage', 'cool', 'coz', 'BOC', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'respect', 'deserve', 'anymore', 'cast', 'unknowns', 'decent', 'enough', 'job', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'character', 'Jill', 'refered', 'oinker', 'hoagley', 'film', 'keep', 'getting', 'reinforced', 'notion', 'Jill', 'supposed', 'be', 'unattractive', 'Well', 'just', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'think', 'Jill', 'unattractive', 'Sure', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'leap', 'off', 'screen', 'Laney', 'one', 'good', 'looking', 'woman', 'course', 'Laney', 'always', 'dressed', 'skimpy', 'Jill', ""n't"", 'Jill', 'also', 'most', '70s', 'Laney', ""n't"", 'Anyhow', 'film', 'sure', 'gem', 'discover', 'did', 'cruising', 'thing', 'high', 'school', 'were', 'teenager', '70s', 'Also', 'really', 'enjoy', 'totally', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'quote', 'box']",N/A
465622,A9WMX36VRB5P1,6305468508,"""undeadstormtrooper""","[12, 13]","First of all,if you were ever a teenager,you will probably relate to this movie. If you were a teenager in the late seventies or early eighties,you will definitely relate to this movie! On the box of this film it says:Even better than Dazed And Confused! Now that may or may not be true,but I think the films are too different to compare. I think one reason this movie never really took off is because of this comment on the box. I think many people rented it thinking this was going to be just like D.A.C., then after realizing it wasn't they were disappointed and turned off by it. But viewing the movie on it's own terms, you will realize how fun it really is. I have to admit it isn't a big box office film,but more like a B movie. But many B movies are better than the big budgeted ones, and this one proves this point. The main characters are Joe and Hubbs,and you will probably find yourself relating to one or the other. Hubbs is the confident,cocky type who tends to do things before thinking about the consequences of his actions,and Joe is more of the intellectual,geeky headbanger. Together they scam for chicks, along with another great character named Tack, who is mostly referred to as ""just some dude"". Tack is a guy you won't soon forget. I was really sad to see the credits roll on this one! One of my favorite films,but I must say I had trouble playing the dvd on my players. I have two different dvd players and dvd rom on my computer,but I could not get TWO different copies to play on them. Unfortunately,I only have the vhs version now. From a review below this one, I see someone else had the same problem. I hope they reprint this movie sometime soon so it will play on all dvd players.(The movie did play when I took it back to the retail store on a Sony dvd player.)
