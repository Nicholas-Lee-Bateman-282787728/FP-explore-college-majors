And not to mention, very educational. I appreciate it even more now than when it was on TV. There should have been a season seven!  There was so much more storyline potential! However, I did wonder about the episode ""A Time to Heal"".  There seems to be some content missing.  On the description, it states that Hank blames squatters for causing the epidemic and sets fire to their settlement, but that is totally left out in the two part episode.  I thought these were uncut episodes but maybe not!  Anyways, I don't regret paying the money, which was alot, for this very well done program!",5,should have been more,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,721,"['am', 'so', 'pleased', 'own', 'six', 'seasons', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'truly', 'phenomenal', 'show', 'children', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'summer', 'not', 'mention', 'very', 'educational', 'appreciate', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'season', 'seven', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'storyline', 'potential', 'However', 'did', 'wonder', 'episode', 'Time', 'Heal', 'be', 'content', 'missing', 'description', 'Hank', 'squatters', 'causing', 'epidemic', 'sets', 'fire', 'settlement', 'totally', 'left', 'out', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'thought', 'were', 'uncut', 'episodes', 'maybe', 'not', 'Anyways', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'paying', 'money', 'was', 'alot', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'program']",N/A
4136,AO7RFXGXSY3LN,0767081455,"Amy Wallace ""Buttonsamy""","[45, 51]","I have been a huge fan of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman since I was a child. When the DVD's first came out, I was thrilled to finally be able to rewatch all of them. I have been waiting to get the final season on DVD, and the extra commentary with Jane and her husband on the award winning episode, ""Point Blank"" makes this a great final box set.PROS: Season six is the final season of this wonderful show that is filled with family values. Seeing all the characters older; Colleen in college, Brian becomming a young man, and little Katie growing up makes the viewer feel like part of the family. By this point in the show, the lighting and scenery is gorgeous, and everyone looks perfect 100% of the time. (Not so historically accurate, but still enjoyable to watch) The town of Colorado Springs has grown from a small western town, and sets like the Sully homestead and Chateau Springs Hotel are really gorgeous.CONS: Season six is really a let down after so many years of the show being fabulous. Don't get me wrong, not all of it is bad, but I felt that the scriptwriters lost steam. Too many characters die, Sully/Joe Lando is not in many of the episodes, and even Dr. Mike seems not so headstrong. Many of the episodes are about depressing topics, such as alcoholism, epidemics and death. I also hated seeing how things deteriorated with the indians, and knowing this was all based on historical fact makes this season particularly more depressing than some of the other seasons.So, even though I would watch Dr. Quinn no matter how terrible it was and still love every minute, I decided that this season was only worth 4 stars. If your a new Dr. Quinn fan, I would reccomend some of the other seasons before purchasing this one, as it is more for devoted fans who are familiar with the storyline and plots of the show. I would have loved to see more of this show, or even perhaps see the two Dr. Quinn movies, ""Revolutions"" and ""The Heart Within"" end up on DVD along with outtakes, bloopers and interviews from the cast members. Maybe AE will take the hint...",4,Season Six needs a little of the doctor's touch....,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,2063,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'Medicine', 'Woman', 'was', 'child', 'When', 'DVD', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'thrilled', 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'rewatch', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'get', 'final', 'season', 'DVD', 'extra', 'commentary', 'Jane', 'husband', 'award', 'winning', 'episode', 'Point', 'Blank', 'great', 'final', 'box', 'set.PROS', 'Season', 'six', 'final', 'season', 'wonderful', 'show', 'filled', 'family', 'values', 'Seeing', 'characters', 'older', 'Colleen', 'college', 'Brian', 'becomming', 'young', 'man', 'little', 'Katie', 'growing', 'up', 'viewer', 'feel', 'part', 'family', 'point', 'show', 'lighting', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'everyone', 'perfect', '100', '%', 'time', 'Not', 'so', 'historically', 'accurate', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'town', 'Colorado', 'Springs', 'grown', 'small', 'western', 'town', 'sets', 'Sully', 'homestead', 'Chateau', 'Springs', 'Hotel', 'are', 'really', 'gorgeous.CONS', 'Season', 'six', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'show', 'being', 'fabulous', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'bad', 'felt', 'scriptwriters', 'lost', 'steam', 'Too', 'many', 'characters', 'die', 'Sully/Joe', 'Lando', 'not', 'many', 'episodes', 'even', 'Dr.', 'Mike', 'not', 'so', 'headstrong', 'Many', 'episodes', 'are', 'depressing', 'topics', 'such', 'alcoholism', 'epidemics', 'death', 'also', 'hated', 'seeing', 'how', 'things', 'deteriorated', 'indians', 'knowing', 'was', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'season', 'particularly', 'more', 'depressing', 'other', 'seasons.So', 'even', 'would', 'watch', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'matter', 'how', 'terrible', 'was', 'still', 'love', 'minute', 'decided', 'season', 'was', 'only', 'worth', '4', 'stars', 'new', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'fan', 'would', 'reccomend', 'other', 'seasons', 'purchasing', 'one', 'more', 'devoted', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'storyline', 'plots', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'show', 'even', 'perhaps', 'see', 'two', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'movies', 'Revolutions', 'Heart', 'Within', 'end', 'up', 'DVD', 'outtakes', 'bloopers', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'Maybe', 'AE', 'will', 'take', 'hint']",N/A

Season 6 is much darker, as it deals with some very difficult topics including death (of several pivotal characters), miscarriage, PTSD, and alcoholism to name a few. The thing is though, in the midst of this there are many positive changes that occur in the town, and somehow all of the loose ends manage to get tied up by the season finale. I personally appreciated the differences between this season and the other five, as I feel like there was more emotional depth to this season, especially since as fans we have grown to know the characters intimately by this point, and we can truly appreciate how they each deal with the darker aspects of life. I think it's important to see how the characters deal with life in the bad times as well as the good, and I appreciated how the producers were not afraid to explore that side of their lives.My only disappointment with this season is the finale, as I feel the ending was a bit anti-climatic. The last episode wasn't terrible, but I just felt like so much had happened throughout the season that the series needed to go out with a bigger bang.
