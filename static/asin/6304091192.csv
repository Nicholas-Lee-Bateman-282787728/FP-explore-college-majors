We found ourselves mirrored in this movie--the struggle of soul mates who happened to be different races to simply be together like any other couple.  As played by Hutton and Rechon, this movie is one of the best love stories you'll ever see.Who knows why Loving took to his wife so?  In a part of the country where race was always a factor, love between these two people easily materialized and created lasting bonds.  The Duke of Wales had no problem giving up his throne for the woman he loved; Richard Loving had no problem sacrificing for his love either.  And this love story is just as heartfelt and powerful as any told in books or movies.  The forces that strive to separate them, drive them out of their home in Virginia, pressure them, whatever, just don't succeed.  It's a fascinating look at our country under apartheid and its growth out of it by activists who could find legitimate cases challenging our legal and moral views.Aside from the politics, the love story soars.  At the end, it will make you weep for a soul mate if you haven't been blessed to find yours yet.",5,Soul mates and the times,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,1153,"['husband', 'first', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'released', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'found', 'mirrored', 'movie', 'struggle', 'soul', 'mates', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'different', 'races', 'simply', 'be', 'together', 'other', 'couple', 'played', 'Hutton', 'Rechon', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'love', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see.Who', 'why', 'Loving', 'took', 'wife', 'so', 'part', 'country', 'where', 'race', 'was', 'always', 'factor', 'love', 'two', 'people', 'easily', 'materialized', 'created', 'lasting', 'bonds', 'Duke', 'Wales', 'had', 'problem', 'giving', 'up', 'throne', 'woman', 'loved', 'Richard', 'Loving', 'had', 'problem', 'sacrificing', 'love', 'love', 'story', 'just', 'heartfelt', 'powerful', 'told', 'books', 'movies', 'forces', 'strive', 'separate', 'drive', 'home', 'Virginia', 'pressure', 'whatever', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'fascinating', 'look', 'country', 'apartheid', 'growth', 'activists', 'who', 'could', 'find', 'legitimate', 'cases', 'challenging', 'legal', 'moral', 'views.Aside', 'politics', 'love', 'story', 'soars', 'end', 'will', 'make', 'weep', 'soul', 'mate', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'blessed', 'find', 'yours', 'yet']",Mr & Mrs Loving VHS
400743,A3DSC3FFBC0LKC,6304091192,Mitchell R. Alegre,"[7, 7]",A young interracial couple of the 1960's fights Virginia's racist laws against mixed marriages. It seems unbelievable today that such laws would exist in the United States. Viewing this film reminds us that racial  prejudice has deep roots and it takes ordinary citizens with the courage to  stand up for their rights if discrimination is to be overcome. The movie  was well done with good performances. A good film for young people to see  to remind them not to take their freedoms for granted.,4,Fight Against Prejudice,956534400,"04 24, 2000",2000,495,"['young', 'interracial', 'couple', '1960', 'fights', 'Virginia', 'racist', 'laws', 'mixed', 'marriages', 'unbelievable', 'today', 'such', 'laws', 'would', 'exist', 'United', 'States', 'Viewing', 'film', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'deep', 'roots', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'courage', 'stand', 'up', 'rights', 'discrimination', 'be', 'overcome', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'good', 'performances', 'good', 'film', 'young', 'people', 'see', 'remind', 'not', 'take', 'freedoms', 'granted']",Mr & Mrs Loving VHS

This was a very courageous couple whether they realized it or not.I have wanted to see this movie for awhile and i am so glad i finally saw it.I think these two played the role of the Lovings very well. Their chemistry was wonderful to watch and so believable, thus it brought the story to life.The original Lovings definitely deserve the honor of being remembered for what they went through to change those ridiculous laws. Without knowing they somehow helped pave the way for a better society and made people have an open mind about what love really is, and can be, no matter the color or culture.Love is something that if it finds you, if you do not pursue it,or are scared to,the results will probably be regret and unhappiness, or being with someone you really don't love, just because of the opinions of others.",5,"Lovely couple!The true Mr.Loving had a lot of courage to seek out his own happiness,regardless of what others thought.",1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,1027,"['did', 'not', 'want', 'movie', 'end.Usually', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'heartbreak', 'racial', 'injustice', 'i', 'lose', 'interest', 'become', 'disappointed', 'was', 'great', 'watch', 'good', 'ending', 'turned', 'out', 'favor', 'was', 'very', 'courageous', 'couple', 'realized', 'not.I', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'awhile', 'i', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'i', 'finally', 'saw', 'it.I', 'think', 'two', 'played', 'role', 'Lovings', 'very', 'well', 'chemistry', 'was', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'so', 'believable', 'thus', 'brought', 'story', 'life.The', 'original', 'Lovings', 'definitely', 'deserve', 'honor', 'being', 'remembered', 'what', 'went', 'change', 'ridiculous', 'laws', 'knowing', 'somehow', 'helped', 'pave', 'way', 'better', 'society', 'made', 'people', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'what', 'love', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'matter', 'color', 'culture.Love', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'pursue', 'are', 'scared', 'results', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'regret', 'unhappiness', 'being', 'someone', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'just', 'opinions', 'others']",Mr & Mrs Loving VHS

400746,A3IXC749UVCXWF,6304091192,Sabrina M. Messenger,"[3, 3]","Why? Because it's the perfect way to celebrate ""Loving Day"" an unofficial commemoration of the Supreme Court decision that struck down anti-miscegenation laws in Virginia, 16 other states and nationwide. Naturally, Richard and Mildred Loving weren't the first (or the last) interracial couple in America, they were the first to have the courage to challenge an unfair law...and for that alone, they are heroes and role models to all who believe in personal freedoms.If you ask me, Mr. & Mrs. Loving should be re-released into theaters rather than just limited to cable television. This is the kind of movie I enjoy watching most...a love story that is based on the inherent romance of Reality. I thought that Timothy Hutton and Lela Rochon played the roles of Richard and ""Bean"" Loving in a very believable and empathetic way...and the actors selected to be their children were just adorable! One of the things I appreciated about this movie was the way it demonstrated how the Lovings were like any other ordinary couple: how they had the same good times and that they sometimes had similar miscommunications, jealousies, and insecurities other couples experience, and how they sometimes fought with each other about the same relationship issues that any other couple has to work their way through. By showing the various emotions displayed in this movie, I felt that it helped the viewer, even if they've never been in an interracial relationship, identify with the Loving family and their plight.While I firmly believe that the Civil Rights story in Mr. & Mr. Loving is an important story...and is one that definitely needs to be told rather than downplayed, I must say that I was glad that this movie wasn't treated as some dull and dry ""documentary"" or ""advocacy"" type of story. I'm even gladder still that the message of this story wasn't blurred by some sensationalist trash bordering on soft core racist pornography. Far too often most interracial love stories are treated in this manner...and I find that patently offensive. As a person who had dated/married interracially, I have a vested interest in seeing more movies done featuring realistic portrayals of couples that look like my partner and I, quality romantic movies with beautiful cinematography, fully developed characters and believable well written plots...and at the same time are still entertaining and allow that bit of escapism we crave when watching films.One of the things I appreciated about this movie was watching the transition of ""Bean"" from being that naive trusting teenager,the one who practically worshipped the ground Richard walked on...and watching transform into a strong, confident mature woman with her own tastes and opinions apart from her husband...and to see her be able to stand up to her husband without alienating him.Overall, I thought it was a very good movie, but I do have a few suggestions that would improve the DVD: Showing more deleted scenes, include some outtakes, perhaps a documentary about the actual family and the case, one that lets real life interracial couples talk about their lives and experiences, as well as the making of this movie with interviews from the actors, producer and director.",5,Great viewing for every June 12 to celebrate Loving Day,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,3209,"['Why', 'perfect', 'way', 'celebrate', 'Loving', 'Day', 'unofficial', 'commemoration', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'decision', 'struck', 'down', 'anti-miscegenation', 'laws', 'Virginia', '16', 'other', 'states', 'nationwide', 'Naturally', 'Richard', 'Mildred', 'Loving', 'were', ""n't"", 'first', 'last', 'interracial', 'couple', 'America', 'were', 'first', 'have', 'courage', 'challenge', 'unfair', 'law', 'alone', 'are', 'heroes', 'role', 'models', 'who', 'believe', 'personal', 'freedoms.If', 'ask', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Loving', 'should', 'be', 're-released', 'theaters', 'rather', 'just', 'limited', 'cable', 'television', 'kind', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'most', 'love', 'story', 'based', 'inherent', 'romance', 'Reality', 'thought', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Lela', 'Rochon', 'played', 'roles', 'Richard', 'Bean', 'Loving', 'very', 'believable', 'empathetic', 'way', 'actors', 'selected', 'be', 'children', 'were', 'just', 'adorable', 'One', 'things', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'demonstrated', 'how', 'Lovings', 'were', 'other', 'ordinary', 'couple', 'how', 'had', 'same', 'good', 'times', 'sometimes', 'had', 'similar', 'miscommunications', 'jealousies', 'other', 'couples', 'experience', 'how', 'sometimes', 'fought', 'other', 'same', 'relationship', 'issues', 'other', 'couple', 'work', 'way', 'showing', 'various', 'emotions', 'displayed', 'movie', 'felt', 'helped', 'viewer', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'identify', 'Loving', 'family', 'plight.While', 'firmly', 'believe', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'story', 'Mr.', 'Mr.', 'Loving', 'important', 'story', 'one', 'definitely', 'be', 'told', 'rather', 'downplayed', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'glad', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'treated', 'dull', 'dry', 'documentary', 'advocacy', 'type', 'story', ""'m"", 'even', 'gladder', 'still', 'message', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'blurred', 'sensationalist', 'trash', 'bordering', 'soft', 'core', 'racist', 'pornography', 'Far', 'too', 'often', 'most', 'interracial', 'love', 'stories', 'are', 'treated', 'manner', 'find', 'patently', 'offensive', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'dated/married', 'interracially', 'have', 'vested', 'interest', 'seeing', 'more', 'movies', 'done', 'featuring', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'couples', 'look', 'partner', 'quality', 'romantic', 'movies', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'fully', 'developed', 'characters', 'believable', 'well', 'written', 'plots', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'still', 'entertaining', 'allow', 'bit', 'escapism', 'crave', 'when', 'watching', 'films.One', 'things', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'transition', 'Bean', 'being', 'naive', 'trusting', 'teenager', 'one', 'who', 'practically', 'worshipped', 'ground', 'Richard', 'walked', 'watching', 'transform', 'strong', 'confident', 'mature', 'woman', 'own', 'tastes', 'opinions', 'apart', 'husband', 'see', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'husband', 'alienating', 'him.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'suggestions', 'would', 'improve', 'DVD', 'Showing', 'more', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'outtakes', 'perhaps', 'documentary', 'actual', 'family', 'case', 'one', 'real', 'life', 'interracial', 'couples', 'talk', 'lives', 'experiences', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'movie', 'interviews', 'actors', 'producer', 'director']",Mr & Mrs Loving VHS

They pretty much were the final straw that helped do away with interracial marriages being illegal in the south (it happened in June 1967 which is a crying shame that it took that long). This movie was pretty good. Tim Hutton always does well in his acting and Lela Rochon was OK. It was a rather quick movie and it told the basic lives of Richard & Mildred Loving and what they had to go through because they were a black and white couple and got married in the south. I recommend seeing this movie if you have an interest in the interracial struggles of those who fell in love and did what they wanted against the odds and prevailed.,3,Enlightening,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,729,"['had', 'been', 'doing', 'research', 'interracial', 'relationships/marriages', 'came', 'Lovings', 'pretty', 'much', 'were', 'final', 'straw', 'helped', 'do', 'away', 'interracial', 'marriages', 'being', 'illegal', 'south', 'happened', 'June', '1967', 'crying', 'shame', 'took', 'long', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Tim', 'Hutton', 'always', 'well', 'acting', 'Lela', 'Rochon', 'was', 'OK', 'was', 'rather', 'quick', 'movie', 'told', 'basic', 'lives', 'Richard', 'Mildred', 'Loving', 'what', 'had', 'go', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'couple', 'got', 'married', 'south', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'interest', 'interracial', 'struggles', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'did', 'what', 'wanted', 'odds', 'prevailed']",Mr & Mrs Loving VHS
