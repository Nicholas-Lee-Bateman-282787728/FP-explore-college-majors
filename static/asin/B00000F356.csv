Mr. Dalton was the only saving grace in this overblown production featuring a future Bond and Indiana Jones villain (Julian  Glover). I did not sense any fire from Anna Calder-Marshall as Cathy, who looked a little too old for the role. I've yet to see the 1992 film version starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Bionche. The screenplay for this version was extremely bad, with the exception of one scene:-SPOILER AHEAD!!!-When Heathcliff (Timothy Dalton) and Isabella Linton are kissing aall the way through when Herathcliff escapes on horseback. I can't remember all the liberties taken, as it's been several years since I read the novel, but I COMPLETELY HATED THE ENDING TO THIS VERSION!!! SPOILER AHEAD!!! The villainous Hindley Earnshaw shoots Heathcliff, who dies soon after. SPOILER OVER!!! Apart from the scene not being in the book, it wasn't even filmed correctly. That scene completely destroyed what Ms. Bronte intended through the novel, and which the 1939 film version starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier, in his breakout role, as Heathcliff, conveyed: the torment of lost love. Not Rated, but I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS FILM VERSION.

I've watched the Olivier/Oberon version off and on all my life but always felt it was lacking in that Olivier seemed too old for the part (although he was great to look at) and Oberon was so pinched and snobbish it was hard to believe he could love her.  In this version that is not the case even though the leading lady who plays Cathy (Anna Calder-Marshall) is not very attractive in my opinion.  Dalton carries this film with his intense performance and even makes the young lady seem more attractive as the film progresses.

497256,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00000F356,Joseph Haschka,"[19, 36]","In the past several months, I've seen at least one film adaptation of all the Jane Austen books, plus one of Charlotte Bronte's JANE EYRE, and this one of sister Emily's WUTHERING HEIGHTS. All at the behest of a good friend hoping to make me a better person. OK, fine. But I refuse to read the original novels.What I find interesting is the difference in tone, and apparently the states of mind, of Jane versus Emily and Charlotte. Austen's works, while perhaps depicting the lives of its heroines as somewhat silly by today's standards, are at least generally lighthearted. The Brontes' plots - at least the two I've been exposed to - are apocalyptically gloomy. Of course, Jane spent her life in the sunny and pastoral south of England, while Emily and Charlotte hail from the relatively desolate and rock-strewn Yorkshire Dales. Perhaps it's something in the water.In WUTHERING HEIGHTS, Heathcliff is the young orphan rescued from a life in the streets and brought home by Mr. Earnshaw (Harry Andrews) to live at his Yorkshire farm with his family, which also includes his daughter Cathy and his son Hindley. As they grow through childhood, Cathy and Heathcliff spend their time together roaming the moors, and vow mutual everlasting devotion. For no reason that I could discern, the older Hindley boy resents Heathcliff, but is the one sent away to get expensively educated.By the time the elder Earnshaw dies, Heathcliff and Cathy are in their late teens, now played by Timothy Dalton and Anna Calder-Marshall respectively. Hindley (Julian Glover), now married, returns from the outside world to claim his inheritance. Heathcliff's fortunes take a bad turn when Hindley relegates him to a position not much better than a farm hand. In the meantime, Cathy lives temporarily in the local magistrate's grand manor house, where she acquires the manners and dress of a &quot;lady&quot; and attracts the eye of the judge's son, Edgar (Ian Ogilvy). Eventually returning to her brother's household with superior airs, Cathy essentially wishes Heathcliff would take a bath. To make the first half of the film's story short, Hindley's wife dies soon after giving birth, Hindley drives Heathcliff away to a destination unknown, and Cathy, with nothing better to do, weds Edgar.Have I spoiled the plot? No, because it doesn't truly get going until Heathcliff, with a wardrobe and personal appearance make-over, suddenly walks in on Hindley and his drunken buds after an absence of three years. The audience never finds out where he's been, but he obviously has an attitude problem and means to settle old scores. (At this point, I was reminded of Dalton's role as France's King Philip in THE LION IN WINTER.) And he's lost none of the raw wildness from those years mucking about the countryside.My understanding is that this WUTHERING HEIGHTS foreshortens the book, but is faithful to it as far as it goes. Subsequent to Heathcliff's dramatic return, I expected a great ending. What I got was overwrought melodrama as Heathcliff makes himself totally insufferable with all and sundry. He's a social misfit if ever there was one, totally out of his depth. The film's apparent message is that one can't escape his/her upbringing.

While Sir Laurence Olivier and Ralph Fiennes have both done respectable turns as Heathcliff, Timothy Dalton is just glorious!! He embodies the character's passion, ambivalence and consuming torment and longing for Cathy splendidly. Anna Calder-Marshall, while perhaps not one would think would make an ideal Cathy, is wonderful as the Yorkshire lass. Oh, how these two sizzle! Whenever Dalton speaks, or broods, the room temperature just seemed to skyrocket! The ill-fated lovers find themselves separated and bound by circumstance and other people, leading to tragic results.Sure, the consummation of their relationship did not occur in the book, but with young hot actors like Timothy and Anna, how could the filmmakers not succumb to temptation? The locations (complete with windswept wild moors) and music are intoxicatingly gorgeous as well. I don't know how Emily Bronte would feel about this adaptation, but I'd like to think that this production would have done her proud.Like some other viewers, I was disappointed that the second generation were not featured and that the ending seemed tacked on.  Those are the only things that stop me from giving this movie 5 stars. Also, I seem to remember a few other scenes from the VHS (there is a still from one of them on the DVD jacket) that are not included on the disc. But this version captured the passion and intensity between Heathcliff and Cathy.The DVD transfer has been wonderfully restored, a big improvement over the VHS print.  A few specks and scratches show from time to time, and other than that, aside from the hairstyles (which indicate the decade in which it was made), you wouldn't think the movie is 40 years old.Make sure you've got a fan going, as well as ice cold drinks, because the heat will go way up!",4,"Whatever Souls Are Made Of, His And Mine Are The Same",1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1874,"['Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'video', ""'m"", 'very', 'excited', 'available', 'DVD', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'have', 'done', 'respectable', 'Heathcliff', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'just', 'glorious', 'character', 'passion', 'ambivalence', 'consuming', 'torment', 'longing', 'Cathy', 'splendidly', 'Anna', 'Calder-Marshall', 'perhaps', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'ideal', 'Cathy', 'wonderful', 'Yorkshire', 'lass', 'Oh', 'how', 'two', 'sizzle', 'Whenever', 'Dalton', 'broods', 'room', 'temperature', 'just', 'seemed', 'skyrocket', 'ill-fated', 'lovers', 'find', 'separated', 'bound', 'circumstance', 'other', 'people', 'leading', 'tragic', 'results.Sure', 'consummation', 'relationship', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'book', 'young', 'hot', 'actors', 'Timothy', 'Anna', 'how', 'could', 'filmmakers', 'not', 'succumb', 'temptation', 'locations', 'complete', 'windswept', 'wild', 'moors', 'music', 'are', 'intoxicatingly', 'gorgeous', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'would', 'feel', 'adaptation', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'proud.Like', 'other', 'viewers', 'was', 'disappointed', 'second', 'generation', 'were', 'not', 'featured', 'ending', 'seemed', 'tacked', 'are', 'only', 'things', 'stop', 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'Also', 'seem', 'remember', 'few', 'other', 'scenes', 'VHS', 'still', 'one', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'disc', 'version', 'captured', 'passion', 'intensity', 'Heathcliff', 'Cathy.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'been', 'wonderfully', 'restored', 'big', 'improvement', 'VHS', 'print', 'few', 'specks', 'scratches', 'show', 'time', 'time', 'other', 'aside', 'hairstyles', 'indicate', 'decade', 'was', 'made', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', '40', 'years', 'old.Make', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'got', 'fan', 'going', 'as', 'well', 'ice', 'cold', 'drinks', 'heat', 'will', 'go', 'way', 'up']",Wuthering Heights
497259,A15HUGZ6MHPL16,B00000F356,"Pamela S. Dorris ""eternally learning""","[3, 5]","There's something about the tragically obsessed Wuthering Heights lovers in this film that doesn't please me.First, the director took enormous and inappropriate liberties with the novel, in some instances wandering off the plotline altogether.  Like the Olivier/Oberon version, this movie concerns itself only with the first third of the novel and concludes with Cathy's death, thus ignoring the disturbing extent of Heathcliff's twisted revenge on Hindley, Linton, Isabella, and Cathy herself through the coldly pre-meditated ruination of their children. Broadly limned -- and nothing whatsoever to do with the book -- is an idiotic undercurrent of unrequited love which a fawning and fatuous Nelly bears for the boorish Hindley.  Worst of all, Heathcliff perishs by Hindley's hand in the movie, in direct defiance of the novel.Second, the casting of jug-eared Calder-Marshall was an embarrassment. While she managed to carry off the willful heroine component, I found myself constantly distracted by the debatable questions of whether or not her head was in fact too large for her diminutive body or if her bodily proportions bordered on dwarfism.  She must have been a costumer's nightmare.  In one scene I was appalled to see her in a too-big, billowing cloak gallumping alongside the tall and graceful Timothy Dalton like his little gnomish companion.Dalton acquitted himself well in the part of Heathcliff.  While a little too vulpine in appearance to make him perfect, nevertheless both his acting and saturnine appearance were the only things that kept the movie afloat.  The scene where he dis-inters Cathy's coffin and crushs her body to his chest was positively heart-breaking.Some of the movie's shots were quite wonderful, particularly the wide view of Heathcliff on horseback silhouetted against an enormous Yorkshire sky.I would be remiss if I did not mention Michel Legrand's lushly romantic score, a personal favorite of mine.  What a pity it's not available on CD. (Note: the soundtrack has become available in a limited edition.  It's lush and exquisite.  If you must, beg, borrow or steal to get your hands on a copy. You'll be glad.)For my money, the best film adaptation of Wuthering Heights so far is the Fiennes/Binoche version, since it's one of the few to cover the full story after Cathy's demise.  Buy it instead, or perhaps, as well. (Note: The soundtrack to this film is in limited availability but, like the Legrand score, is worth tracking down. Hauntingly romantic, it's good 'un.)",3,A Withering Review,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,2514,"['something', 'tragically', 'obsessed', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'lovers', 'film', ""n't"", 'please', 'me.First', 'director', 'took', 'enormous', 'inappropriate', 'liberties', 'novel', 'instances', 'wandering', 'off', 'plotline', 'altogether', 'Olivier/Oberon', 'version', 'movie', 'only', 'first', 'third', 'novel', 'concludes', 'Cathy', 'death', 'thus', 'ignoring', 'disturbing', 'extent', 'Heathcliff', 'twisted', 'revenge', 'Hindley', 'Linton', 'Isabella', 'Cathy', 'coldly', 'pre-meditated', 'ruination', 'children', 'Broadly', 'limned', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'book', 'idiotic', 'undercurrent', 'unrequited', 'love', 'fawning', 'fatuous', 'Nelly', 'bears', 'boorish', 'Hindley', 'Worst', 'Heathcliff', 'perishs', 'Hindley', 'hand', 'movie', 'direct', 'defiance', 'novel.Second', 'casting', 'jug-eared', 'Calder-Marshall', 'was', 'embarrassment', 'managed', 'carry', 'off', 'willful', 'heroine', 'component', 'found', 'constantly', 'distracted', 'debatable', 'questions', 'not', 'head', 'was', 'fact', 'too', 'large', 'diminutive', 'body', 'bodily', 'proportions', 'bordered', 'dwarfism', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'costumer', 'nightmare', 'one', 'scene', 'was', 'appalled', 'see', 'too-big', 'billowing', 'cloak', 'gallumping', 'tall', 'graceful', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'little', 'gnomish', 'companion.Dalton', 'acquitted', 'well', 'part', 'Heathcliff', 'little', 'too', 'vulpine', 'appearance', 'make', 'perfect', 'nevertheless', 'acting', 'saturnine', 'appearance', 'were', 'only', 'things', 'kept', 'movie', 'afloat', 'scene', 'where', 'Cathy', 'coffin', 'crushs', 'body', 'chest', 'was', 'positively', 'heart-breaking.Some', 'movie', 'shots', 'were', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'particularly', 'wide', 'view', 'Heathcliff', 'horseback', 'silhouetted', 'enormous', 'Yorkshire', 'sky.I', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'Michel', 'Legrand', 'lushly', 'romantic', 'score', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'What', 'pity', 'not', 'available', 'CD', 'Note', 'soundtrack', 'become', 'available', 'limited', 'edition', 'lush', 'exquisite', 'must', 'beg', 'borrow', 'steal', 'get', 'hands', 'copy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'money', 'best', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'far', 'Fiennes/Binoche', 'version', 'one', 'few', 'cover', 'full', 'story', 'Cathy', 'demise', 'Buy', 'instead', 'perhaps', 'well', 'Note', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'limited', 'availability', 'Legrand', 'score', 'tracking', 'down', 'Hauntingly', 'romantic', 'good', ""'un""]",Wuthering Heights

The Lintons live at Thrushcross Grange while the Earnshaws live at the Heights, on the edge of the moors. Mr. Earnshaw brings home a gypsy boy and this creates jealousy and rivalry between his children.  While Catherine becomes refined, Heathcliff turns into a ""beast"" in a way. This is similar to the beauty and the beast at a few points in the story. There is a pretty funny scene where Catherine and Heathcliff enjoy taunting the Lintons.If ever there was a story of obsessive love, it has been captured it in torturous scenes that contain a certain madness and desire. This is by far the best version of Wuthering Heights I?ve seen so far. I has all the darkest elements combined with fiery passion. The kissing scenes in this movie are highly charged and completely erotic.Child-like Catherine (Anna Calder-Marshal) and the young gypsy Heathcliff (Timothy Dalton) start off as young sweethearts who are just happy to be with one another out in the French countryside. Soon Catherine becomes obsessed with Heathcliff  and wants him to promise her they will always be friends. She puts a curse on their lives if they ever break the promise. With hands on a stone, their fate is sealed.Heathcliff  soon becomes Catherine's only reason for living, without him she is in a state of vapid listlessness. He can literally control her with the slightest inattention. When she hears of his love for Isabella, she is tortured in body and soul. She goes to the height and depth of obsessive love.""I fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice."" ~ HeathcliffHeathcliff  swears he will never leave, then he does. It drives Catherine into despair. Then he returns when she has given up all hope and has already married Edgar Linton, who rescues her from herself.I love the line:""When I'm dead, I think I'll come haunt you as the sunset."" ~CatherineOne of literature's greatest love stories and this is the best adaptation I've seen so far.A tale of tormented lovers who are destined to be together until the end of time and beyond.~The Rebecca Review",5,Dark Tale of Friendship and Desire,1060387200,"08 9, 2003",2003,2278,"['are', 'welcome', 'torture', 'death', 'amusement', 'only', 'allow', 'amuse', 'little', 'same', 'style', 'refrain', 'insult', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'able', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'classic', 'tale', 'two', 'families', 'Lintons', 'live', 'Thrushcross', 'Grange', 'Earnshaws', 'live', 'Heights', 'edge', 'moors', 'Mr.', 'Earnshaw', 'home', 'gypsy', 'boy', 'jealousy', 'rivalry', 'children', 'Catherine', 'becomes', 'refined', 'Heathcliff', 'beast', 'way', 'similar', 'beauty', 'beast', 'few', 'points', 'story', 'pretty', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Catherine', 'Heathcliff', 'enjoy', 'taunting', 'Lintons.If', 'ever', 'was', 'story', 'obsessive', 'love', 'been', 'captured', 'torturous', 'scenes', 'contain', 'certain', 'madness', 'desire', 'far', 'best', 'version', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 've', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'darkest', 'elements', 'combined', 'fiery', 'passion', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'highly', 'charged', 'completely', 'erotic.Child-like', 'Catherine', 'Anna', 'Calder-Marshal', 'young', 'gypsy', 'Heathcliff', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'start', 'off', 'young', 'sweethearts', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'happy', 'be', 'one', 'out', 'French', 'countryside', 'Soon', 'Catherine', 'obsessed', 'Heathcliff', 'promise', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'friends', 'curse', 'lives', 'ever', 'break', 'promise', 'hands', 'stone', 'fate', 'sealed.Heathcliff', 'soon', 'Catherine', 'only', 'reason', 'living', 'state', 'vapid', 'listlessness', 'can', 'literally', 'control', 'slightest', 'inattention', 'When', 'love', 'Isabella', 'tortured', 'body', 'soul', 'height', 'depth', 'obsessive', 'love', 'fought', 'bitter', 'life', 'last', 'heard', 'voice', 'HeathcliffHeathcliff', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'then', 'Catherine', 'despair', 'Then', 'when', 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'already', 'married', 'Edgar', 'Linton', 'who', 'herself.I', 'line', 'When', ""'m"", 'dead', 'think', ""'ll"", 'come', 'haunt', 'sunset', '~CatherineOne', 'literature', 'greatest', 'love', 'stories', 'best', 'adaptation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far.A', 'tale', 'tormented', 'lovers', 'who', 'are', 'destined', 'be', 'together', 'end', 'time', 'beyond.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Wuthering Heights
