It sounds cliche, but truly, THAT GIRL is as fresh today as it was some 40 (gulp!) years ago.  Why?  The series was beautifully produced with excellent production values; the writing is superb; and the characters are wonderfully realized by Marlo Thomas, Ted Bessell, Lew Parker and others.  In addition, some of the best character actors working in Hollywood at the time appear in many episodes.Season Three finds the series in full bloom.  Season One set the stage, it grew during Season Two, and now the show has come into its own.  Terrific episodes here, esp. the one in which Ann takes a bit part on a ""Laugh-In""-style show (""Laugh-In"" was a huge TV hit at the time) in which she descends a staircase as a very glamorous woman, only to take a pie in the face.  Not a slapstick episode...just great stuff!In this set, we once again have commentary by Marlo Thomas and producer Bill Persky, which is terrific, as well as a really interesting piece on how the show was produced week after week.The shows look and sound great, and the set is beautifully packaged.  Pick yourself up a copy, and you'll be SO glad you did.Can't wait to get to Season 5, in which the title theme's rarely-heard lyrics are sung (and by the same background singers who supplied ""The Partridge Family"" and ""Love, American Style"" sound).

1048860,A105D0UKK3356E,B000MQ4WMY,Dunestar,"[8, 8]","When I was growing up, I used to watch Marlo Thomas in That Girl, and loved the show because she was rather a modern day version of Lucy at the time.  But what I really liked was nothing really got Ann Marie down, when she was determined, she got things done... even if they didn't quite work out the way she wanted it to.Of course, she always had problems with Don and her father when making the odd decisions (like when Ann's agent suggested she change her name to a more suitable stage name), but somehow Ann always came through.Sometimes Ann would get into fixes without even trying.  For instance, in ""Bad Day at Marvin Gardens,"" Ann's parents decide to go to the city to a baseball game and attend the theater with Ann and Don.  Regrettably an unexpected rainstorm washes out the afternoon game, so the four decide on playing a game of Monopoly.  When the competition ends up with just Don and Mr. Marie, the game heats up where Mr. Marie offers to buy Don's Marvin Gardens, but Don refuses.  Realizing it's just a game, Don decides to graciously give the property to Lou Marie.Regrettably Lou views this as an absolute insult with him proclaiming: ""Nobody gives Lou Marie Marvin Gardens!"" As a result Don and Lou end up brooding over the entire matter up to when they go to the theater.  Naturally Ann and her mom, Helen, attempt to qualm the dispute.  But when Helen sides with Don, Lou angrily gets a separate room at their hotel.And you thought the Ricardos and the Mertzes had problems!But I do give kudos to Shout! Factory for keeping the original uncut versions of the episodes intact.  Because when I watched them syndicated [even on Nick at Nite, C Channel (now Comedy Central), and TV Land], I never knew networks cut out scenes for time constraints.  Here I get to see the episodes intact and jog my memory of how some of the episodes originally went vs. my addled brain (I was about four when I watched the reruns and some of the episodes on ABC).Personally I wish Shout! Factory could make a deal with Ms. Thomas and Rankin Bass to include the Saturday ABC Movie Special, ""That Girl in Wonderland,"" where Ann works for a children's book publisher, and envisions herself as the classic stars of famous storybook characters.Especially since the First Season's hidden nugget had the original That Girl pilot [where Bessel played as Thomas' agent, and later inspired Episode #11 'What's in the Name?'], while the Second Season's gem had Marlo's never-aired pilot, ""Two's Company.""  I think would be great if they used that with either this Season or an upcoming Season.Anyway, this series is definitely a must for anyone who fondly remembers That Girl, or is a fan of classic television.  I definitely recommend That Girl for everyone's TV Land DVD collection.",5,Definitely That Girl's for me..,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,2775,"['When', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'used', 'watch', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'Girl', 'loved', 'show', 'was', 'rather', 'modern', 'day', 'version', 'Lucy', 'time', 'what', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'nothing', 'really', 'got', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'down', 'when', 'was', 'determined', 'got', 'things', 'done', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'way', 'wanted', 'to.Of', 'course', 'always', 'had', 'problems', 'Don', 'father', 'when', 'making', 'odd', 'decisions', 'when', 'Ann', 'agent', 'suggested', 'name', 'more', 'suitable', 'stage', 'name', 'somehow', 'Ann', 'always', 'came', 'through.Sometimes', 'Ann', 'would', 'get', 'fixes', 'even', 'trying', 'instance', 'Bad', 'Day', 'Marvin', 'Gardens', 'Ann', 'parents', 'decide', 'go', 'city', 'baseball', 'game', 'attend', 'theater', 'Ann', 'Don', 'Regrettably', 'unexpected', 'rainstorm', 'out', 'afternoon', 'game', 'four', 'decide', 'playing', 'game', 'Monopoly', 'When', 'competition', 'up', 'just', 'Don', 'Mr.', 'Marie', 'game', 'up', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Marie', 'buy', 'Don', 'Marvin', 'Gardens', 'Don', 'Realizing', 'just', 'game', 'Don', 'graciously', 'give', 'property', 'Lou', 'Marie.Regrettably', 'Lou', 'absolute', 'insult', 'proclaiming', 'Nobody', 'Lou', 'Marie', 'Marvin', 'result', 'Don', 'Lou', 'end', 'up', 'brooding', 'entire', 'matter', 'up', 'when', 'go', 'theater', 'Naturally', 'Ann', 'mom', 'Helen', 'attempt', 'qualm', 'dispute', 'when', 'Helen', 'sides', 'Don', 'Lou', 'angrily', 'separate', 'room', 'hotel.And', 'thought', 'Ricardos', 'Mertzes', 'had', 'problems', 'do', 'give', 'kudos', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'keeping', 'original', 'uncut', 'versions', 'episodes', 'intact', 'when', 'watched', 'syndicated', '[', 'even', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'C', 'Channel', 'now', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'TV', 'Land', ']', 'never', 'knew', 'networks', 'cut', 'out', 'scenes', 'time', 'constraints', 'Here', 'get', 'see', 'episodes', 'intact', 'jog', 'memory', 'how', 'episodes', 'originally', 'went', 'addled', 'brain', 'was', 'about', 'four', 'when', 'watched', 'reruns', 'episodes', 'ABC', '.Personally', 'wish', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'could', 'make', 'deal', 'Ms.', 'Thomas', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'include', 'Saturday', 'ABC', 'Movie', 'Special', 'Girl', 'Wonderland', 'where', 'Ann', 'children', 'book', 'publisher', 'envisions', 'classic', 'stars', 'famous', 'storybook', 'characters.Especially', 'First', 'Season', 'hidden', 'nugget', 'had', 'original', 'That', 'Girl', 'pilot', '[', 'where', 'Bessel', 'played', 'Thomas', 'agent', 'later', 'inspired', 'Episode', '11', ""'What"", 'Name', ']', 'Second', 'Season', 'gem', 'had', 'Marlo', 'never-aired', 'pilot', 'Two', 'Company', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'used', 'Season', 'upcoming', 'Season.Anyway', 'series', 'definitely', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'fondly', 'Girl', 'fan', 'classic', 'television', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Girl', 'everyone', 'TV', 'Land', 'DVD', 'collection']",That Girl: Season 3

This DVD set does not have as many extras as the seasons one and two boxed sets. In one episode, Ann Marie plans on voting for the first time. In another episode, an African-American boy pretends that Ann is his mother. In another episode, a restaurant owner tries to earn Ann's love through free meals. There's still plenty of chemistry between Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessell. Ted Bessell dreamed of directing a That Girl movie, but the project fell apart. Also, Bessell died in the mid-1990's. The production values on That Girl were high in the 1960's. The cast and crew used sets and locations. They used filmstock instead of video. Each episode had quality music. It was hard to find reruns of That Girl in the 1980's and 1990's. There were cable channels that had exclusive broadcast rights for episodes. I didn't watch That Girl reruns until I was 26 years of age! These days, Hollywood is driven by nostalgia and brand name recognition. They should produce a reboot of That Girl for TV or a That Girl feature film. By season four or five of That Girl, Marlo Thomas was losing interest in the show. She acted in the downbeat drama Jenny(1970). Thomas played Ann Marie in some animated That Girl TV special that aired on 1970's television. That Girl was a fun, romantic sitcom that gave us a vacation from our dull lives.",4,That Girl Season Three,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,1426,"['Girl', 'Season', 'Three', 'solid', 'season', 'plenty', 'good', 'episodes', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'ones', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'many', 'extras', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'boxed', 'sets', 'one', 'episode', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'voting', 'first', 'time', 'episode', 'African-American', 'boy', 'Ann', 'mother', 'episode', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'tries', 'earn', 'Ann', 'love', 'free', 'meals', 'still', 'plenty', 'chemistry', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'Ted', 'Bessell', 'Ted', 'Bessell', 'dreamed', 'directing', 'Girl', 'movie', 'project', 'fell', 'apart', 'Also', 'Bessell', 'died', 'mid-1990', 'production', 'values', 'Girl', 'were', 'high', '1960', 'cast', 'crew', 'used', 'sets', 'locations', 'used', 'filmstock', 'instead', 'video', 'episode', 'had', 'quality', 'music', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'reruns', 'Girl', '1980', '1990', 'were', 'cable', 'channels', 'had', 'exclusive', 'broadcast', 'rights', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Girl', 'was', '26', 'years', 'age', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'driven', 'nostalgia', 'brand', 'name', 'recognition', 'should', 'produce', 'reboot', 'Girl', 'TV', 'Girl', 'feature', 'film', 'season', 'four', 'five', 'Girl', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'was', 'losing', 'interest', 'show', 'acted', 'downbeat', 'drama', 'Jenny', '1970', 'Thomas', 'played', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'animated', 'Girl', 'TV', 'special', 'aired', '1970', 'television', 'Girl', 'was', 'fun', 'romantic', 'sitcom', 'gave', 'vacation', 'dull']",That Girl: Season 3

I fell in love with Marlo as ""That Girl"" and remain her love puppy.  What...a girl living on her own in NYC...trying to make it as a star...having a career?  Unheard of!  Marlo was a trend-setter.  She was in on the beginning of the women's movement and also was a silent producer, director and writer, just like Donna Reed was.  Marlo had control, but because of the 60's and the repression of women's rights not yet realized, she just remained the star of the show in the public's eye.  I also like the show because of the good, clean humor, which you just don't get anymore.  Nowadays, it seems comedy has to have ""an edge"" to be funny.  I still ask...why?  Anyway, this show was a trail-blazer, funny, beautifully acted, wonderously written and I will always love ""That Girl"", my Marlo.
