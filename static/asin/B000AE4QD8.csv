Because the very character of Doc Martin was originally based off of Clunes' character of Martin Bamford. A revision or two later & the series 'Doc Martin' was born! And boy, do I love it!The series follows Clunes' character of Martin Ellingham, a doctor who was previously a successful surgeon until he developed a nasty aversion to blood. Hoping to find some peace of mind, he decides to become a GP (general practitioner) in the town he used to vacation in as a child- Portwenn. Unfortunately the good doctor seems to have a humongous problem dealing with people... and his bedside manner leaves much to desire. Whether it's dealing with a highly inefficient secretary that's loved by the entire town or making snap diagnoses about health problems, Doc Martin is sure to please!The series is wonderful. This disc set however, does leave something to be desired. Unfortunately the set is beyond being even the barest bones. There's only the episodes on here, with no special features at all.

I had only one complaint, and that was the movie-length episode ending season 2... too over the top, trying too hard to hold attention, and not quite in sync with the characters.  I'm glad season 3 went back to normal again.  I love how it bounces from drama to comedy to both, and never quite knowing just how things are going to go.  I wonder if they'll be able to keep up this momentum, but for now I'm having a great time viewing.  It's nice watching a lot of episodes in a row, and not having to wait for new ones... until I finally get caught up.  All actors are doing a great job.  I'm hooked.  And that says a lot, coming from someone who was never all that wild about tv series.  I prefer movies, or a mini-series that is complete within a few days.  I detest major cliff hangers where you have to wait a year to get answers.  Those lose my interest after the first time they do that.  It seems the outrageous cliff hanging is becoming more and more the norm.  Big mistake!

926601,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000AE4QD8,C. O. DeRiemer,"[87, 92]","Curmudgeons, if blessed with good writers, can be satisfying house guests. They're irascible, oblivious, often insulting (sometimes unintentionally), but usually with a hint of endearing rehabilitation. Dr. Martin Ellingham, formerly a top-rank London surgeon who now practices general medicine in the Cornish town of Portwenn, not only has first-rate writers, he's blessed by having as his impersonator the actor Martin Clunes.Dr. Ellingham (""Martin or Dr. Ellingham, please. Not `Doc Martin!'""), during one simple operation, found himself overwhelmed and unable to continue. The sight of blood suddenly sickened him, not a good thing for a surgeon. It stopped his career cold. He retrained and accepted the job of Portwenn's GP, far away from London and from the people who'd learned of his phobia.But Doc Mar...Dr. Ellingham...seems to have a gene missing in his make-up. He is all too frank, oblivious to human courtesies, awkward, means well but has one of the worst bed-side manners in miles. If you're a young boy who has sprained an arm, an elderly gentleman whose wife is using too much hormone cream, a well-intentioned busy-body who stops by for tea or a cancer patient, don't expect much from the doctor by way of chit chat or hand holding. Even with an actor as good as Clunes, this could be a tiresome one-joke premise, except that Portwenn has a classic collection of idiosyncratic residents, all played by some skilled British actors. There's Doc Martin's aunt, Joan Norton, played by the fine Stephanie Cole, so good inWaiting for God. Joan is an elderly, brisk, no-nonsense woman (wise, too, of course) who wrings a chicken's neck to prepare it for dinner. She lives by herself competently on her farm. There's Bert Large, played by the equally fine Ian McNeice. Bert is Portwenn's handyman and plumber. He's a short man so fat he prefers to give the orders while he sits and trains his son to do all the work. There's the town's policeman who is big, competent, young, shy and concerned about...ah...size. The town's schoolteacher, who cannot understand how Doc Martin can be so obtuse, is about Doc Martin's age, not married and... we'll have to see. Maybe something will happen in season two. It certainly didn't look like romance when, at the end of season one, Doc Martin helpfully mentions to her the possible causes of bad breath right after she unexpectedly kisses him, something he was too ill at ease to initiate himself. There's an assortment of small town biddies, blokes and giggling teenager girls who all love a bit of gossip. Periodically showing up for one-time parts are such established actors as Richard Johnson, Celia Imrie and John Alderton.Doc Martin finds that in Portwenn he has to deal with human nature as often as he has to deal with diarrhea. But with human nature he hasn't a clue. Still, when he suspects something is wrong with a patient, he's not only usually right but he'll do whatever it takes whoever he offends to get good care for the person. Because the quality of the wring is so high, the installments are amusing and satisfying. Good actors make Portwenn's residents more like odd but possibly real people than the usual cut-out yokels. Portwenn itself is a star, too. The town is right on the Cornish coast, picturesque as all get out, with a friendly pub, sea air and easy jaunts down country roads to some beautiful scenery.Most of all is Martin Clunes as Dr. Ellingham. Clunes is a big man with a large head, large ears and a wide mouth. He's not handsome. Clunes, however, is a fine actor who can dominate a scene. He also can effortlessly project cluelessness, umbrage and impatience...and do so while he also makes us realize Doc Martin is almost an innocent when it comes to human interactions.Doc Martin is superior entertainment. Season one consists of six episodes totaling 280 minutes on two DVD discs. The video/audio transfer is excellent.",5,"""That's Dr. Ellingham, if you please, and what's all this moaning about a little diarrhea?""",1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,3914,"['Curmudgeons', 'blessed', 'good', 'writers', 'can', 'be', 'satisfying', 'house', 'guests', ""'re"", 'irascible', 'oblivious', 'often', 'insulting', 'sometimes', 'unintentionally', 'usually', 'hint', 'endearing', 'rehabilitation', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Ellingham', 'formerly', 'top-rank', 'London', 'surgeon', 'who', 'now', 'practices', 'general', 'medicine', 'Cornish', 'town', 'Portwenn', 'not', 'only', 'first-rate', 'writers', 'blessed', 'having', 'impersonator', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Clunes.Dr', 'Ellingham', 'Martin', 'Dr.', 'Ellingham', 'please', 'Not', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'one', 'simple', 'operation', 'found', 'overwhelmed', 'unable', 'continue', 'sight', 'blood', 'suddenly', 'sickened', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'surgeon', 'stopped', 'career', 'cold', 'retrained', 'accepted', 'job', 'Portwenn', 'GP', 'far', 'away', 'London', 'people', 'who', ""'d"", 'learned', 'phobia.But', 'Doc', 'Mar', 'Dr.', 'Ellingham', 'have', 'gene', 'missing', 'make-up', 'too', 'frank', 'oblivious', 'human', 'courtesies', 'awkward', 'well', 'one', 'worst', 'bed-side', 'manners', 'miles', ""'re"", 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'sprained', 'arm', 'elderly', 'gentleman', 'wife', 'using', 'too', 'much', 'hormone', 'cream', 'well-intentioned', 'busy-body', 'who', 'tea', 'cancer', 'patient', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'doctor', 'way', 'chit', 'chat', 'hand', 'holding', 'Even', 'actor', 'as', 'good', 'Clunes', 'could', 'be', 'tiresome', 'one-joke', 'premise', 'Portwenn', 'classic', 'collection', 'idiosyncratic', 'residents', 'played', 'skilled', 'British', 'actors', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'aunt', 'Joan', 'Norton', 'played', 'fine', 'Stephanie', 'Cole', 'so', 'good', 'inWaiting', 'God', 'Joan', 'elderly', 'brisk', 'no-nonsense', 'woman', 'wise', 'too', 'course', 'who', 'chicken', 'neck', 'prepare', 'dinner', 'competently', 'farm', 'Bert', 'Large', 'played', 'equally', 'fine', 'Ian', 'McNeice', 'Bert', 'Portwenn', 'handyman', 'plumber', 'short', 'man', 'so', 'fat', 'give', 'orders', 'son', 'do', 'work', 'town', 'policeman', 'who', 'big', 'competent', 'young', 'shy', 'concerned', 'ah', 'size', 'town', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'obtuse', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'age', 'not', 'married', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'Maybe', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'season', 'two', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'romance', 'when', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'helpfully', 'mentions', 'possible', 'causes', 'bad', 'breath', 'right', 'unexpectedly', 'something', 'was', 'too', 'ill', 'ease', 'initiate', 'assortment', 'small', 'town', 'biddies', 'blokes', 'giggling', 'teenager', 'girls', 'who', 'love', 'bit', 'gossip', 'Periodically', 'showing', 'up', 'one-time', 'parts', 'are', 'such', 'established', 'actors', 'Richard', 'Johnson', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'John', 'Alderton.Doc', 'Martin', 'Portwenn', 'deal', 'human', 'nature', 'as', 'often', 'deal', 'diarrhea', 'human', 'nature', ""n't"", 'clue', 'Still', 'when', 'something', 'wrong', 'patient', 'not', 'only', 'usually', 'right', ""'ll"", 'do', 'whatever', 'get', 'good', 'care', 'person', 'quality', 'wring', 'so', 'high', 'installments', 'are', 'amusing', 'satisfying', 'Good', 'actors', 'make', 'Portwenn', 'residents', 'more', 'odd', 'possibly', 'real', 'people', 'usual', 'cut-out', 'yokels', 'Portwenn', 'star', 'too', 'town', 'right', 'Cornish', 'coast', 'picturesque', 'get', 'out', 'friendly', 'pub', 'sea', 'air', 'easy', 'jaunts', 'down', 'country', 'roads', 'beautiful', 'scenery.Most', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'Dr.', 'Ellingham', 'Clunes', 'big', 'man', 'large', 'head', 'large', 'ears', 'wide', 'mouth', 'not', 'handsome', 'Clunes', 'however', 'fine', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'dominate', 'scene', 'also', 'can', 'effortlessly', 'project', 'cluelessness', 'umbrage', 'impatience', 'do', 'so', 'also', 'realize', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'almost', 'innocent', 'when', 'human', 'interactions.Doc', 'Martin', 'superior', 'entertainment', 'Season', 'one', 'six', 'episodes', 'totaling', '280', 'minutes', 'two', 'DVD', 'discs', 'video/audio', 'transfer', 'excellent']",Doc Martin Series 1 Region 2

But I love Doc Martin, any episode, any time!He's not exactly Prince Charming, in fact he is about the most socially awkward man on tv  but he might be the best doctor in the world.  He WILL save his patients whether they like him or cooperate or not!  Everytime he tells someone to do exactly as he says, I keep waiting for them to punch him rather than just look afronted and scurry away like wounded puppies.  No matter how obnoxious he is they can't deny the fact that he knows what he's doing and they trust him with thier lives even if they make fun of him behind his back.I'd actually like to see his love interest Louisa Glasson stand up to him just once with more than a scolding  for treating her like an old shoe. How deeply she loves him and keeps giving him second, third and millionth chances is actually what the makes the series so endearing.  I love watching her kiss him, closing her eyes and peeking to see if the frog has turned in to a prince yet! :pDespite his gruff exterior and unimpressive manners, Doc has a kind of charisma that keeps me coming back for more. His brilliant mind tunes in instantly to any illness and he's quite the hero saving lives and looking like a fool in the interim with his adversion to blood!  Easy to do considering in almost every episode it seems to shoot out like a gusher everytime someone walks in the office!I wonder if he will ever figure out how to cure his own maladies?

926617,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B000AE4QD8,David Bower,"[1, 1]","We're fans of British drama but had not heard of Doc Martin so we decided to give it a try. Now we're glad we did as this series reveals a truly non-typical hero, Doctor Martin Ellingham.Our first reaction to Doc was how unlikely his appearance was for a leading man, after we adjusted to his appearance we were somewhat put off by his rude, self-centered behavior. It didn't take long, however, for us to get completely interested in this very strange, but dedicated individual.Circumstances, which I will not reveal, results in this well established and competent surgeon relocating from London to the small fishing village of Portwenn in Cornwall. The initial shows in this series address the rather difficult process the Doc and the people of the village have in trying to adjust to each other. A teacher in Portwenn, Louisa Glasson, played by Caroline Catz, provides the occasional romantic interest for Doc; Catz is very touching as Louisa.Whereas this may sound rather mundane, let me assure you it is anything but that; after watching the first episode we were completely hooked on the Doc and his life in Portwenn. Martin Clunes is outstanding as the irascible Doc and actually begins to generate some sympathy for him and his situation. I commented to my wife that the Doc character is very interesting to watch but I certainly wouldn't care to know him personally.One of the benefits of this series is the beautiful scenery around Port Isaac where the series is filmed. For instance, the Doc's house in the series can be seen in Port Isaac. Although the location is a tourist destination, the filming of Doc Martin has helped put Port Isaac on the map.We are now watching the second half of series 4 and look forward to seeing all of the remaining shows. If you enjoy British actors and acting you will enjoy this series. It was a real wake-up call to find something as good as this series and realize that it was only by chance that we found it.I was interested to note the longevity of the actors; it appears all of the leading roles have been played by the same actors since the shows inception in 2004.I have read that a 5th series is scheduled to be filmed in 2011; this gives us fans something to look forward to! The 5th series is scheduled to run 8 episodes.This is a very distinctive series; it may be so distinctive as to polarize some viewers but we have solidly come down on the side of fans of the series.

Nevertheless, he is very intuitive solving medical mysteries that are plaguing the little town.This series is extremely well written and is filled with loads of rather ""black"" humor that the British can do so well.

Some people...)""Doc Martin"" often gets compared (usually unfavorably) with ""Northern Exposure"", so let's start by saying it is NOT the British version of that show.  It was inspired by the movie ""Saving Grace"" about a once wealthy widow who turns to growing pot, and which was also filmed in Port Issac, on the Cornish coast.  However, it doesn't even pick up where that movie left off, either.  ""Doc Martin"" is about a big city doctor with personality issues who takes up practice in a small town, it sounds like ""Northern Exposure"" but it lacks the ensemble cast format, so it always follows the Doc when the show would benefit by focusing every now and then on other characters and their relationships.  It also fails to make anything more than a backdrop out of the gorgeous Cornwall coast, which is a shame.  The producers seem to want to make it into the California coast and always shoot in sunshine, when clearly, this town is not a warm, sunny, Santa Barbara type of town.  I would have enjoyed more good old English weather, rain and all that.Still, once you sit on your ""Northern Exposure"" expectations and smother them, this show entertains.  The doc never fails to leave you exasperated with his sheer rudeness, while at the same time you cheer when he tells some dolt to ""Shut up!"" or ""Get OUT!"".  I watched the series disc by disc, season one through four, and enjoyed all of it, and I look forward to season 5.  Having said that, I would recommend it as I viewed it:  As a rental.  It's good, but not so good you'll want to have it on hand, right now, when you think you'd like to watch an episode or two.  I love the British accent as much as anybody, but I've heard enough of them to know not to be swayed into thinking the mere sound of the Kings English makes anything seem sophisticated and top notch.After all, the British don't think that way...",3,"A Good Entertaining Show, But Better To Rent Than Own",1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,1958,"[""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', '5star', 'ratings', 'show', 'are', 'due', 'British', 'Accent', 'people', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'often', 'compared', 'usually', 'unfavorably', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'let', 'start', 'saying', 'NOT', 'British', 'version', 'show', 'was', 'inspired', 'movie', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'once', 'wealthy', 'widow', 'who', 'growing', 'pot', 'was', 'also', 'filmed', 'Port', 'Issac', 'Cornish', 'coast', 'However', ""n't"", 'even', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'movie', 'left', 'off', 'either', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'big', 'city', 'doctor', 'personality', 'issues', 'who', 'up', 'practice', 'small', 'town', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'format', 'always', 'Doc', 'when', 'show', 'would', 'benefit', 'focusing', 'now', 'then', 'other', 'characters', 'relationships', 'also', 'make', 'anything', 'more', 'backdrop', 'gorgeous', 'Cornwall', 'coast', 'shame', 'producers', 'seem', 'want', 'make', 'California', 'coast', 'always', 'shoot', 'sunshine', 'when', 'clearly', 'town', 'not', 'warm', 'sunny', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'type', 'town', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'good', 'old', 'English', 'weather', 'rain', 'that.Still', 'once', 'sit', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'expectations', 'smother', 'show', 'doc', 'never', 'leave', 'exasperated', 'sheer', 'rudeness', 'same', 'time', 'cheer', 'when', 'dolt', 'Shut', 'up', 'Get', 'OUT', 'watched', 'series', 'disc', 'disc', 'season', 'one', 'four', 'enjoyed', 'look', 'forward', 'season', '5', 'Having', 'said', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewed', 'rental', 'good', 'not', 'so', 'good', ""'ll"", 'want', 'have', 'hand', 'right', 'now', 'when', 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'watch', 'episode', 'two', 'love', 'British', 'accent', 'as', 'much', 'anybody', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'enough', 'know', 'not', 'be', 'swayed', 'thinking', 'mere', 'sound', 'Kings', 'English', 'anything', 'seem', 'sophisticated', 'top', 'notch.After', 'British', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'way']",Doc Martin Series 1 Region 2

926669,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B000AE4QD8,Jack E. Levic,"[5, 15]","I read the reviews and had high hopes for this series. I imagined a big city doctor moving to a quiet village full of quirky and loveable characters. Well, the characters were quirky but few were loveable.Doc Martin is a cranky and unpleasant doctor surrounded but cranky and unpleasant villagers. It should be a perfect match but neither the doctor nor the villagers are accepting of each other. It seems like the only two in town who like Doc Martin are his elderly aunt and a homeless dog that follows him around despite his best efforts to rid himself of the animal.A sudden aversion to blood ruined his highly successful career as a surgeon. The lovely village of Portwenn need a new GP (General Practioner). Doc Martin had spent a few summers in the village with his aunt and that seems to be his reason for applying for the position. It's never clear why the village and the townsfolk seem alien to him even though he had been to Portwenn in his youth.Enter his inept receptionist Elaine--the epitomy of a quirky character. She'd rather talk on the phone than work and she seems dangerously unqualified to work in a medical office. She apparently comes with the office and despite an attempt to fire her, Doc Martin is stuck with Elaine..just as the townspeople expect.It's a slow beginning and finally he has some patients but none have any medical issues. His office becomes a social gathering place for tea and biscuits (cookies). Yet, Doc Martin does have the knack for diagnosing serious conditions in non-patients that he meets in his everyday life. He can see medical conditions before the people realize there is a problem. This is an interesting side of Doc Martin's character that could really be used to liven up the bland storylines.There is a one saving grace of this series and it is a BIG saving grace. The village and the surrounding area are truly beautiful. It's a joy just to see the village and the typical British buildings and the lovely countryside. The scenery alone makes it worth the view.I tried to give the series a chance. I watched 4 episodes and the show seems to be a constant repitition of the villagers showing their disdain of Doc Martin and the doctor returning the mistrust.Lots of reviewers love the series and I wish I could be one of them. I just couldn't get over the bland storylines and the fact that so few characters were likeable.

The main character is a surgeon that develops a phobia about blood so he changes careers suddenly to become a general practitioner in a small but picturesque town. Unfortunately, he has no social skills so things do not go smoothly with the people in the town. He is respected as a doctor but everyone knows how difficult he is. His interactions with people are so funny because he is blunt and truthful. This is not always the easiest way to be. He falls in love with a local teacher but both realize they could never make each other happy. The teacher leaves town to teach in London but returns 6 months pregnant. After the baby is born they try so hard to make it work but dealing with a baby can be very difficult for anyone let alone the situation they find themselves in.

926760,A1S4RK8CHUQCMD,B000AE4QD8,"MusicFan ""MusicFan""","[0, 0]","Barely two months after I first viewed the first episode, ""Doc Martin"" has now become one of my favorite productions ever, movie or television.  In fact, it's hard to think of a better production that I've seen in decades of television and movie viewing -- the outstanding comedy and drama of ""Doc Martin"" are that good.  Five stars are hardly enough for a program that produces this kind of enjoyment.I've now watched all of the currently existing episodes through Series 5, and in my opinion, ""Doc Martin"" sustains its very high level of quality throughout, so I'd recommend the DVDs of all of the seasons.  I can hardly wait for Series 6, which star Martin Clunes has confirmed will be filmed in 2013 and will likely be the last series for the program.For the uninitiated, the premise of the show is that the rather grouchy, socially inept but brilliant Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes) is taking over as a general practitioner in the picturesque seaside village of Portwenn in southwestern England, after leaving his London surgical practice when he develops a blood phobia.  Schoolteacher Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz) is one of the few villagers who appreciates Martin's good qualities -- she understands that his social rudeness disguises a man who actually cares for other people in a very literal way.  A romance results, creating a running thread through all of the seasons, although there are significant setbacks along the way.Martin and Louisa are joined by plumber/restauranteur Bert Large (Ian McNeice) and his son/business partner Al (Joe Absolom); Martin's Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole), who runs a small, struggling family farm by herself; later on, Martin's Aunt Ruth (Dame Eileen Atkins), a psychiatrist; a series of quirky receptionists in the doctor's office, with Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) as the longest-serving and most memorable; the village pharmacist, Mrs. Tishell (Selina Cadell), who has a lasting crush on Martin; and two successive village police officers, Mark Mylow (Stewart Wright) and Joe Penhale (John Marquez), who share some well-meaning comic ineptitude with Mayberry's Barney Fife.Both the acting and the writing on ""Doc Martin"" contain considerable depth.  My wife and I knew we were seeing something unusually good when, after each episode, we began discussing the characters' motivations, how their family backgrounds affected their personalities, and what those characters might have been doing while they were off-stage as a logical prelude to their on-stage actions.  Now, obviously, we know that these are fictional characters who don't really have family backgrounds and aren't really doing anything when they're not in a scene.  But the actors and the writers have created characters with so many dimensions that there is something very real about them -- it makes the viewer care about what they're going through now and wonder what's going to happen to them next.  To me, this is the ultimate success for a dramatic production: to create its own reality, one that the audience cares about.  All of the actors noted above and, of course, the writers have a great deal to be proud of here.As you might guess, almost every program contains medical problems for Martin to deal with, ranging from routine but sometimes funny ailments to life-threatening emergencies -- that's the life of the only doctor in a small village.  But this isn't really a show about medicine, even though the main character is a medical doctor, it's a comedy/drama about a wide variety of people with a wide variety of things going on in their lives -- from Aunt Joan's financial problems on the farm to the Larges' business setbacks to the romantic yearnings of PC Mark Mylow.  But although the group of characters (and actors) here is outstanding, I wouldn't call this a true ensemble drama, because the series focuses on Martin, who is undoubtedly the main character -- this is his story, even though the other characters' stories are told as well.  As the show progresses, Louisa comes to share that focus because her relationship with Martin becomes so important to the show.  In this aspect, there's a certain similarity to ""Pride and Prejudice,"" I think, because both stories involve a romance, long in developing, between a very good-natured, sensible, and highly competent woman and a rather rude, haughty, but worthwhile man who needs someone to humanize him.  Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz constantly impress with the meaning they bring to these roles with their brilliantly subtle characterizations.  Small, almost unnoticed expressions often convey worlds of feeling.(The Martin-Louisa romance has really caught the public imagination, apparently.  In an LA Times interview, Martin Clunes says that ""[a] boy came up and asked me for my autograph, followed by an old man who said, 'I don't want your autograph but just marry that girl before I die, willya?' That seems to sum up the level at which it hits people."")But I'm not trying to downplay the other characters, and the excellent actors who portray them.  They're all a very important part of this show's considerable charm, and they all have their turns (sometimes numerous turns) as the center of different subplots in particular episodes.  These subplots can be either comic or dramatic for particular characters, rather than being only one or the other, again showing the depth of the writing and acting.  For example, Bert and Al Large, who are usually involved in rather funny situations, also deal with more serious family issues and business problems. PC Joe Penhale, a classic well-meaning bumbler, also has a sad encounter with his ex-wife.  And even when a character doesn't have his/her own plotline, that person very ably supports the characters who do.While there's certainly a good deal of drama in these programs, the laughs shouldn't be overlooked.  The Larges, the police officers, the receptionists, and Mrs. Tishell all provide much humor -- as does Martin himself, whose disdainful reactions to the villagers are often very funny.This story of an emotionally stunted man has the potential to create an abundance of emotion in its audience, because most viewers, I think, will care about these characters, laughing at their foibles and commiserating with their sorrows.  I give it my highest recommendation.  I would guess that most people who see just a few of the early episodes will, like me, want to see all of them, perhaps multiple times.",5,Perhaps the Best Television Series Ever!,1346889600,"09 6,

But you come to understand him somewhat, and of course he saves the day on a regular basis.My only complaint about the show is that some of the story lines are overly dependent on sexual themes. I dislike when TV writers distrust their audience with tamer matters. Everyday life is fascinating enough; there's no need to try to dress it up with salacious (and patently ridiculous) matters, in my opinion.

However, I prefer to think of him as a strange cross between House and James Harriot. Although James was just nice, nice, nice (ad nauseum), the situations in which they find themselves are really very similar - close-knit countryside full of bizarre natives with bizarre rituals. In personality he is much more like House, with one huge difference: House is a rude, insensitive jerk simply because he enjoys it, while Martin, not a jerk at all, frequently acts like one because he doesn't seem to know any better. Like House, Martin's dry, deadpan comebacks are hilarious.Each episode of Season 1 is better than the one before, culminating in an ending so funny I think I had tears in my eyes. He just never learns, does he?I still can't quite put my finger on what makes Martin so charming, since I'm not sure I would enjoy knowing him in person. Probably (and due in large part to the brilliant Martin Clunes) it is because he is so very real, and you can't help but identify with his out-of-place, misunderstood persona.

There was something a little hit strange about the main character, Doc Martin, played by Martin Clunes, but, since he was a surgeon, that made some sense.Dr. Martin Ellingham, a  London surgeon developed a horrible reaction to the sight of blood. He also dies not have a good bedside manner, and he looks for another job. A GP is needed in a small village in a Cornish fishing village. He had spent summers there and, indeed, loved the area.Martin was written and created by Dominic Minghella.  Martin became the charmless, and insensitive physician, who is a brilliant diagnostician. He is so impossible I felt myself rooting for him. He is an off beat but good man. Once he is in the village, he sets up an office, people come by just to see him, and then they all develop unusual conditions, that he can almost always solve. In the process he falls in love with the schoolteacher Louisa, played by Carolyn Catz. She discovers she is attracted to him, but she doesn't really like him.Every week a new medical condition is discovered, often including a interesting storyline.  Doc Martin gains weight and loves the town. The town is an intricate turn of hillside streets and scenic overlooks. The town characters are the receptionists Lucy Punch and Katherine Parkinson; Ian McNeice, as a plumber ; Joe Absolom as McNeice's  son; Stewart Wright and John Marquez as police constables,  and Stephanie Cole as Martin's stubborn Aunt Joan.  I began to think quite often that Doc Martin has Aspergers. He has all the characteristics. But, it makes no difference, really. This is a character who has soul, a romantic comedy we can all relate to.Recommended. prisrob 04-07-14",4,The Soul Of The Village,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,1794,"[""'Doc"", 'Martin', 'one', 'shows', 'have', 'found', 'better', 'However', 'first', 'year', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'was', 'something', 'little', 'hit', 'strange', 'main', 'character', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'played', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'was', 'surgeon', 'made', 'sense.Dr', 'Martin', 'Ellingham', 'London', 'surgeon', 'developed', 'horrible', 'reaction', 'sight', 'blood', 'also', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'bedside', 'manner', 'job', 'GP', 'needed', 'small', 'village', 'Cornish', 'fishing', 'village', 'had', 'spent', 'summers', 'there', 'indeed', 'loved', 'area.Martin', 'was', 'written', 'created', 'Dominic', 'Minghella', 'Martin', 'became', 'charmless', 'insensitive', 'physician', 'who', 'brilliant', 'diagnostician', 'so', 'impossible', 'felt', 'rooting', 'beat', 'good', 'man', 'village', 'up', 'office', 'people', 'come', 'just', 'see', 'then', 'develop', 'unusual', 'conditions', 'can', 'almost', 'always', 'solve', 'process', 'love', 'schoolteacher', 'Louisa', 'played', 'Carolyn', 'Catz', 'attracted', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'him.Every', 'week', 'new', 'medical', 'condition', 'discovered', 'often', 'including', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'gains', 'weight', 'town', 'town', 'intricate', 'turn', 'hillside', 'streets', 'scenic', 'overlooks', 'town', 'characters', 'are', 'receptionists', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'Katherine', 'Parkinson', 'Ian', 'McNeice', 'plumber', 'Joe', 'Absolom', 'McNeice', 'son', 'Stewart', 'Wright', 'John', 'Marquez', 'police', 'constables', 'Stephanie', 'Cole', 'Martin', 'stubborn', 'Aunt', 'Joan', 'began', 'think', 'quite', 'often', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Aspergers', 'characteristics', 'difference', 'really', 'character', 'who', 'soul', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'can', 'relate', 'to.Recommended', 'prisrob', '04-07-14']",Doc Martin Series 1 Region 2

Here he plays a more serious character with a sufficient number of foibles to add comic dimensions to his actions.  He plays an eminent surgeon who has suddenly developed an aversion to the sight of blood and redefined himself as a G.P. in a small, seaside village in Cornwall.  This is a succession of fish out of water tales, with the amusement coming in equal measure from the doctor himself and the quirky locals.  The doctor is well-meaning but occasionally feckless, dead-panned in his honesty and laconic in his speech (when, e.g., he is being interviewed by the local talk show host).  This is the sort of thing that the British do expertly.  The individual episodes are relatively brief, so that you can watch several in an evening or shoehorn one in when you don't have the time or inclination for a full-length feature.
