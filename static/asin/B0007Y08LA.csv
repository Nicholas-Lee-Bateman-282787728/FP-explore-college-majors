The combination of narrative and whimsical tales that every kid ponders (International Parent Conspiracy, Outer Space, Independence, Love), to the great cameos (Michael Stipe, Iggy Pop, Steve Buscemi, Adam West, Kate Pierson), exposure to indie rock (which I still appreciate to this day), and endearing characters really made this show magical for me.I'll never forget watching ""King of the Road"" and just giggling my head off while my dad watched next to me and laughed along.  There aren't many kids shows out there that can transcend generational gaps like that. I can still go back and enjoy these episodes at 24 as much if not more so than I did when I was a kid.

I found that most of them (Darkwing Duck, Goof Troop, Ren and Stimpy, etc.) were actually pretty horrible. I can't imagine why I ever liked them in the first place. But The Adventures of Pete and Pete was a VERY different story - it was far more profound and brilliant than I had remembered. Every episode seems random, whimsical, and wacky, but somehow ends in a way that leaves you thinking ""wow, what an awesome show"". Pete and Pete has more in common with The Tick or Strangers with Candy than with Nickelodeon's other shows. I only wish Nickelodeon would go faster with their other shows - Rocko's Modern Life was another brilliant show that deserves DVD immortality, and Space Cases will always have a special place in my heart.

Additionally, I notice things now that were above me when I was younger. This show is insightful, full of amusing youthful angst, and funny. A great addition to my DVD collection. The episodes included in season 2 are:1. King of the Road - Dad attempts to defend his reign of King of the Road while on a family roadtrip.2. Day of the Dot - Ellen becomes obessed with being selected as the dot in the &#34;i&#34; of her marching band.3. The Nightcrawlers - Little Pete and his friends attempt to break the world record for staying awake.4. Rangeboy - Big Pete is embarassed to be working at Dad's driving range and dresses as a bear to hide his identity.5. Tool and Die - Big Pete is put into shop class, much to his displeasure.6. Don't Tread on Pete - Little Pete races the clock to study for a test while Big Pete takes part in an epic dodgeball game.7. When Pete's Collide - The Pete's compete to inherit Dad's prized bowling ball, &#34;Rolling Thunder&#34;8. Hard Day's Pete - Little Pete goes on a journey to find who played his favorite song he only heard once.1.",5,A classic Nickelodeon show which has stood the test of time,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,1538,"['are', 'shows', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'kid', 'when', 'see', 'again', 'adult', 'are', 'left', 'disappointed', 'almost', 'wishing', 'had', ""n't"", 'watched', 'so', 'can', 'preserve', 'memory', 'So', 'loved', 'watching', 'Pete', 'Pete', 'back', '1993', 'when', 'was', '8', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'skeptical', 'again', 'watching', 'adult', 'However', 'nostalgia', 'got', 'best', 'ordered', 'these.This', 'show', 'stood', 'test', 'time.It', 'bit', 'enjoyable', 'now', 'was', 'then', 'Additionally', 'notice', 'things', 'now', 'were', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'show', 'insightful', 'full', 'amusing', 'youthful', 'angst', 'funny', 'great', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'episodes', 'included', 'season', '2', 'are:1', 'King', 'Road', 'Dad', 'defend', 'reign', 'King', 'Road', 'family', 'roadtrip.2', 'Day', 'Dot', 'Ellen', 'becomes', 'obessed', 'being', 'selected', 'dot', '34', 'i', '34', 'marching', 'band.3', 'Nightcrawlers', 'Little', 'Pete', 'friends', 'attempt', 'break', 'world', 'record', 'staying', 'awake.4', 'Rangeboy', 'Big', 'Pete', 'embarassed', 'be', 'working', 'Dad', 'driving', 'range', 'bear', 'hide', 'identity.5', 'Tool', 'Die', 'Big', 'Pete', 'put', 'shop', 'class', 'much', 'displeasure.6', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tread', 'Pete', 'Little', 'Pete', 'clock', 'study', 'test', 'Big', 'Pete', 'part', 'epic', 'dodgeball', 'game.7', 'When', 'Pete', 'Collide', 'Pete', 'compete', 'inherit', 'Dad', 'prized', 'bowling', 'ball', '34', 'Rolling', 'Thunder', '34', '8', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Pete', 'Little', 'Pete', 'journey', 'find', 'who', 'played', 'favorite', 'song', 'only', 'heard', 'once.1']",The Adventures of Pete & Pete - Season 1

THis was back when Nick had good shows, before the crap they have now like All Grown Up, Spongebob Squrepants, Rocket Power, and As Told By Ginger (which has the worst portrayal of highschool I have ever seen). What made Pete and Pete so great was how they characters were portrayed. The Pete'S are the kind of kids who are wise beyond their years, and other kids and even adults can relate to them. We can all relate to them because everyone knows how tough it can be being a kid and what it's like to grow up and seek exceptance from other. Although the town of Wellsville is fictitious, there are little things about it that are very close to home. The fact that the show is narrated by the oldest Pete makes it better because we get to see the world through the eyes of an adolescent, and it's in an intellegent way.

If I had been younger, it might have become my favorite show, bar none. The show gets 10 stars; this review refers to the DVD.The quality of the shows is good. The absence of commercial breaks is a bit glaring, but that's to be expected in a recorded TV show. The most bothersome thing to me about the disc is that everytime I pop it in I have to fast forward through 4 ads for movies and Nick shows (Lemony Snickets, Sponge Bob, Brady Bunch...) I expect this when I rent, but when I purchase something I wish there was a way to skip to the menu.The bonus material is good - commentaries don't interest me and I'm not the biggest polaris fan but I listened to the 6 or 7 songs they put on.

894441,A3ZP2A2SWNRCB,B0007Y08LA,race_of_doom,"[122, 125]","I'm not here to critique the show ""The Adventures of Pete & Pete"" -- I could go on for a very long time and still not convey what it, as a show, means to me. It (like another review here wonderfully stated) still holds up, even when you have had it's importance build up in your mind after years of not being able to see it. Usually, your favorite childhood shows are incredibly underwhelming after a prolonged hiatus -- but in this case, the show is actually even weirder and more sophisticated than you remember.I'd just like to respond to the review concerning the quality (as in visual) of this DVD set.Someone else hinted that because of the bootlegs, this set is unnecessary. The quality of the bootlegs are not any better, and in many cases worse. For this DVD set, the actual quality of the episodes is what you'd see on TV if they were re-run on Nickelodeon.The most glaring problem occurs in the episode ""Day of the Dot"" (the classic Big Pete and Ellen kiss on the football field) -- a noticable and slightly annoying tape error creates a constant line of red in the upper section of the screen, and it stays that way for about five to ten minutes.But other than that, there's really not much else to complain about.Nickelodeon obviously didn't know how to handle this show properly; if there are any other faults noticable on these episodes, it's just how they are now. There's no way to go back and reverse the damage done to the master tapes throughout the years.That's not to say the quality is God-awful; far from that. If you have seen the recent and much lamented Noggin re-runs, you'll know what you're getting. Neither above-average or below-average quality, just good enough.So leave quality out of your mind when you purchase -- these episodes look just fine, and we should be thankful that they are finally available. Buying this set may also help the future of other Nickeloden DVD releases (I personally would love some ""You Can't Do That on Television"") and more seasons of this classic show on DVD.Final edit: the commentary tracks for this DVD set are from co-creators Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi and director Katherine Dieckmann on the episodes ""What We Did on Our Summer Vacation,"" ""Day of the Dot"" and ""The Nightcrawlers."" Also of note is the Polaris music station, which features seven songs that can also be found on the Polaris CD (aptly titled ""Music From The Adventures of Pete & Pete"").",5,a few notes,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,2425,"[""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'critique', 'show', 'Adventures', 'Pete', 'Pete', 'could', 'go', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'still', 'not', 'convey', 'what', 'show', 'review', 'here', 'wonderfully', 'stated', 'still', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'have', 'had', 'importance', 'build', 'up', 'mind', 'years', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'Usually', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'shows', 'are', 'incredibly', 'underwhelming', 'prolonged', 'hiatus', 'case', 'show', 'actually', 'even', 'weirder', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'remember.I', ""'d"", 'just', 'like', 'respond', 'review', 'concerning', 'quality', 'visual', 'DVD', 'set.Someone', 'else', 'hinted', 'bootlegs', 'set', 'unnecessary', 'quality', 'bootlegs', 'are', 'not', 'better', 'many', 'cases', 'worse', 'DVD', 'set', 'actual', 'quality', 'episodes', 'what', ""'d"", 'see', 'TV', 'were', 're-run', 'Nickelodeon.The', 'most', 'glaring', 'problem', 'episode', 'Day', 'Dot', 'classic', 'Big', 'Pete', 'Ellen', 'kiss', 'football', 'field', 'noticable', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'tape', 'error', 'constant', 'line', 'red', 'upper', 'section', 'screen', 'way', 'about', 'five', 'ten', 'minutes.But', 'other', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'complain', 'about.Nickelodeon', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'show', 'properly', 'are', 'other', 'faults', 'noticable', 'episodes', 'just', 'how', 'are', 'now', 'way', 'go', 'back', 'reverse', 'damage', 'done', 'master', 'tapes', 'years.That', 'not', 'say', 'quality', 'God-awful', 'far', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'much', 'lamented', 'Noggin', 're-runs', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'above-average', 'below-average', 'quality', 'just', 'good', 'enough.So', 'leave', 'quality', 'mind', 'when', 'purchase', 'episodes', 'look', 'just', 'fine', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', 'are', 'finally', 'available', 'Buying', 'set', 'may', 'also', 'help', 'future', 'other', 'Nickeloden', 'DVD', 'personally', 'would', 'love', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Do', 'Television', 'more', 'seasons', 'classic', 'show', 'DVD.Final', 'edit', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'co-creators', 'Will', 'McRobb', 'Chris', 'Viscardi', 'director', 'Katherine', 'Dieckmann', 'episodes', 'What', 'Did', 'Summer', 'Vacation', 'Day', 'Dot', 'Nightcrawlers', 'Also', 'note', 'Polaris', 'music', 'station', 'seven', 'songs', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'found', 'Polaris', 'CD', 'aptly', 'titled', 'Music', 'Adventures', 'Pete', 'Pete']",The Adventures of Pete & Pete - Season 1

Then there's a 98% chance you already have watched The Adventures Of Pete & Pete! But for those who either only heard of this show. Or maybe stumbled across it on youtube. The Adventures Of Pete & Pete was a show which started out as just a short....It'd have like a little 2 minute bit between shows. And shortly there after, became it's own series! This DVD set is the first season. This show was awesome back in the early-mid 90's, & still holds up these days! My son has been hooked on watching these since I introduced him to the odd, yet funny characters. There's Big Pete, Little Pete, Ellen, Pete & Pete's mom & dad. And of course Artie, ""The strongest man.....In the world""! The quality of video & sound is aparently older quality. Not bad though in my opinion! They look & sound just like I remember back in the 90's. If you have a Blu-ray player w/ HDMI hook-up, & a LCD it'll look good! And if you still have a older TV &  DVD player....It looks fine too! This DVD set comes with bonus features. Which are the shorts I previously mentioned. And a few episodes. Including the long episodes, like where Pete, Little Pete, & Ellen attempt to become friends with Mr.Tasty. after trying...Mr.Tasty ends up dissapearing. Kids are going crazy, wishing Mr.Tasy would retuen with the awesome Blue Tornado Bars. Pete, Little Pete, & Ellen go into a searching frenzy for Mr.Tasty! It's a classic episode & one of my personal favorites. That, and the Nightcrawler episode. Where Little Pete takes a stand against his parnet's bed time set for him. He get's his friends to join him (Artie included). And they form a group that will stay up for days, playing flashlight tag, ect... They call themselves The Nightcrawlers! One by one, Little Pete's friends fall victim to being tired & pass out snoozing. If you watched this show back in the day you'll likely enjoy it just as you did before! And if your new to the series, you'll enjoy this the same! It's one of Nickelodeon's best shows from the 80's-current days.  I highly recommend this DVD! Also, if you remember this. You probably watched Are You Afriad Of The Dark? That DVD is also available on here. But the. One's you'll probably wanna get are on Canada's amazon.

894446,A1Y8FBJLVK6LS9,B0007Y08LA,Wayne A.,"[25, 36]","The punkers and weirdo creatives from the late seventies started to do more ambitious underground work in the Eighties and then moved on to, of all things, kid's programming in the Nineties (the last place in this culture where fun was still appreciated). Elsewhere it's glowering rappers, rock stars who look like porn stars (and boy, has adult entertainment become seriously un-fun), film stars who look like body builders, and body builders running state governments. This is why you have Mark Mothersbaugh doing Rug Rats music or Iggy Pop in Pete and Pete--where else do people like that go? Also why you had the whole Pee-Wee schtick. (There's a full book in this for somebody ambitious). By the late Nineties, as the highly successful bean counters and Harvard jerks took over the reigns of big-profit businesses, they gradually moved the wacko creatives out. Wacko creatives do NEW things which do nothing but throw unpredictability into marketing-by-numbers. Wonder, whimsy, and wacky--never the province of most business zombies as the head of Disney has proven over and over--got lost and then stomped to death on a September morning by representatives of the most un-wondrous, un-wackiest, un-whimsicalist dreary-arsed world-view on Earth. Read Gibbon for insights on this phenomenon. Oh, and then there was Political Correctness, a social vampire sapping all the fun and irony out of everything. Toss in rockin' Fundamentalist Christians (as if this dead horse needed any more beating)...and joy-to-all militant feminists. Now look at the fine work this pack of jackasses has done to make this a better world and ask yourself why it just gets grayer and more joyless every year? Let's face it, none of these morons ever really wanted to make the world a better place for anyone, even themselves. They're all angy and nasty little sadists, they'd all take candy from a baby and pitilessly watch it cry. The more of us who accept this truth, the more chance there may be of doing something about it.Pete and Pete was one of the last flowerings of an amazing era. Its lunacy was nothing short of inspired, it's joy for life resuscitating. The show is a clarion call for those of us who've just about had more than enough of everyone else's baloney. I fell in love with this show in my thirties. I think those of you out there who truly love this show and sorely miss what it represents will agree with my little rant.
