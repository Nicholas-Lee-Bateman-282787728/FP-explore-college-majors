1151448,A19EKT8H85AKO5,B0015XHR5M,BigStory,"[0, 0]","Gotta say it was an interesting ride watching the 07-08 season with the accelerated rise of the new ""Big Three"" Boston Celtics. Unlike later incarnations of Big Three's, this Celtics squad came together quickly and was as smooth as silk winning right out the gate and continuing the 'Ubuntu' theme throughout the season.Even as a non-Celtics fan, I really enjoyed this DVD as it capably captures the essence of that magical season. The main documentary leads you thru the first signing of Garnett/Allen and on through the season until they reach the playoffs and experience some of their first turmoil having to deal with a couple of game 7's.This DVD contains a nice amount of extra features. I liked looking back at Garnett's first experience as an All-Star in '97 along with the 4th Quarter elimination games against the Cavs and Pistons. There's a few improvements that would've made this DVD even better. I wish they included footage of the Championship parade.Also unlike the old season/playoff reviews(the one's from the 80's), this program no longer covers the rival teams progress leading to the Finals. It would be nice to see the journey of the WCF champs road to the Finals. This would set up the magnitude of the matchup better.Other than these couple of small gripes, this is a near perfect Championship DVD that adequately captures the magic and essence of a team that came together at the right time and reached the ultimate goal. This DVD is great for Celtic fans or even just for basketball fans who wish to relieve the 'Ubuntu' season.",5,The 'Ubuntu' season,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,1554,"['Got', 'ta', 'say', 'was', 'interesting', 'ride', 'watching', '07-08', 'season', 'accelerated', 'rise', 'new', 'Big', 'Three', 'Boston', 'Celtics', 'later', 'incarnations', 'Big', 'Three', 'Celtics', 'squad', 'came', 'together', 'quickly', 'was', 'as', 'smooth', 'silk', 'winning', 'right', 'gate', 'continuing', ""'Ubuntu"", 'theme', 'season.Even', 'non-Celtics', 'fan', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'capably', 'essence', 'magical', 'season', 'main', 'documentary', 'leads', 'thru', 'first', 'signing', 'Garnett/Allen', 'season', 'reach', 'playoffs', 'experience', 'first', 'turmoil', 'having', 'deal', 'couple', 'game', ""7's.This"", 'DVD', 'nice', 'amount', 'extra', 'features', 'liked', 'looking', 'back', 'Garnett', 'first', 'experience', 'All-Star', ""'97"", '4th', 'Quarter', 'elimination', 'games', 'Cavs', 'Pistons', 'few', 'improvements', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'DVD', 'even', 'better', 'wish', 'included', 'footage', 'Championship', 'parade.Also', 'old', 'season/playoff', 'reviews', 'one', '80', 'program', 'no', 'longer', 'rival', 'teams', 'progress', 'leading', 'Finals', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'journey', 'WCF', 'champs', 'road', 'Finals', 'would', 'set', 'up', 'magnitude', 'matchup', 'better.Other', 'couple', 'small', 'gripes', 'near', 'perfect', 'Championship', 'DVD', 'adequately', 'magic', 'essence', 'team', 'came', 'together', 'right', 'time', 'reached', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'DVD', 'great', 'Celtic', 'fans', 'even', 'just', 'basketball', 'fans', 'who', 'wish', 'relieve', ""'Ubuntu"", 'season']",2007-2008 NBA Champions: Boston Celtics

1151450,A2HBRINA3F9YHV,B0015XHR5M,Doctor Trance,"[11, 11]","First of all, ignore the back of the DVD, as the main program runs a full 77 minutes, not 60.  When this first came out, I was very hesitant due to the short running time (which I thought was only 60) and rather steep price.  However, finding it now for a good price and watching how good the main program is, and how long and fulfiling it is, this is well worth the cash.  That's not even to mention all the loads of extras this one disc comes with.You get the ""I Am A Celtic"" documentary, which features excellent interviews with Bob Cousy, Sam Jones, and John Havlicek.  It features a lot of clips that are in the main program, but also comes with a lot of stuff I'd never seen before, including the ""race"" Doc had at one practice, where he made everyone who lost to him in a sprint take an extra round of practice.  He cheated and got a head start and I had only read about this in an article when it happened, and it was nice to see the video behind it.  Both this documentary and the main show contain a lot of humorous and insightful looks into practice, the preseason, and behind the scenes with the coaches and players.  Having seen the entire year unfold on TV, these not on television moments made for a very entertaining watch.You also get two full 4th quarters from Game 7 of the Cleveland series, and Game 6 of the Detroit series.  Very welcomed extras and nice to see this historic quarters in their entirety.  We will certainly get the entire Lakers series when the full Celtics box set comes out, so there's no need to complain about not getting them now.  We already get what I feel is a great compliment of features for this price.  There are also 7 other bonus features which include features on Ray Allen, Bill Russell and KG, Paul Pierce, and Danny Ainge.Back to the main show, where we get about 18 minutes of preseason and regular season coverage, then onto the Eastern Conference playoffs for a good 25 minutes, until the 43 minute mark, and then a full half hour of the Lakers/Celtics Finals.  While they didn't dwell too deeply on any one game, it was a well balanced showing of the highlights.  The credits then roll with some humorous and candid moments of the team, ending the program at the 77 minute mark.I think it was good that I waited nearly 2 months to pick this DVD up, as watching it in the weeks after the win, when the DVD first came out, may have been too premature, and not as impactful as seeing it now, after going a long time without a good Celtics fill.  I did seem to have a problem with the narrator at first, as he seemed kind of dull.  However, as it got deeper and deeper into the show, he seems to grow on you, and to the point where he fits in nicely and his delivery and flow is perfect.An excellent all around DVD, and in my opinion, well worth it to any Celtics fan.  It's one for the collection, and will be a compliment to the box set due out in November.",5,"Well rounded, 77 minute recap with loads of extras; and well worth it.",1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,2914,"['First', 'ignore', 'back', 'DVD', 'main', 'program', 'full', '77', 'minutes', 'not', '60', 'When', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'very', 'hesitant', 'due', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'only', '60', 'rather', 'steep', 'price', 'However', 'finding', 'now', 'good', 'price', 'watching', 'how', 'good', 'main', 'program', 'how', 'long', 'fulfiling', 'well', 'cash', 'not', 'even', 'mention', 'loads', 'extras', 'one', 'disc', 'with.You', 'get', 'Am', 'Celtic', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'interviews', 'Bob', 'Cousy', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'John', 'Havlicek', 'lot', 'clips', 'are', 'main', 'program', 'also', 'lot', 'stuff', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'including', 'race', 'Doc', 'had', 'one', 'practice', 'where', 'made', 'everyone', 'who', 'lost', 'sprint', 'take', 'extra', 'round', 'practice', 'cheated', 'got', 'head', 'start', 'had', 'only', 'read', 'article', 'when', 'happened', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'video', 'documentary', 'main', 'show', 'contain', 'lot', 'humorous', 'insightful', 'looks', 'practice', 'preseason', 'scenes', 'coaches', 'players', 'Having', 'seen', 'entire', 'year', 'unfold', 'TV', 'not', 'television', 'moments', 'made', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch.You', 'also', 'get', 'two', 'full', '4th', 'quarters', 'Game', '7', 'Cleveland', 'series', 'Game', '6', 'Detroit', 'series', 'Very', 'welcomed', 'extras', 'nice', 'see', 'historic', 'quarters', 'entirety', 'will', 'certainly', 'get', 'entire', 'Lakers', 'series', 'when', 'full', 'Celtics', 'box', 'set', 'out', 'need', 'complain', 'not', 'getting', 'now', 'already', 'get', 'what', 'feel', 'great', 'compliment', 'features', 'price', 'are', 'also', '7', 'other', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'features', 'Ray', 'Allen', 'Bill', 'Russell', 'KG', 'Paul', 'Pierce', 'Danny', 'Ainge.Back', 'main', 'show', 'where', 'get', '18', 'minutes', 'preseason', 'regular', 'season', 'coverage', 'then', 'Eastern', 'Conference', 'playoffs', 'good', '25', 'minutes', '43', 'minute', 'mark', 'then', 'full', 'half', 'hour', 'Lakers/Celtics', 'Finals', 'did', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'deeply', 'one', 'game', 'was', 'well', 'balanced', 'showing', 'highlights', 'credits', 'then', 'roll', 'humorous', 'candid', 'moments', 'team', 'ending', 'program', '77', 'minute', 'mark.I', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'waited', 'nearly', '2', 'months', 'pick', 'DVD', 'up', 'watching', 'weeks', 'win', 'when', 'DVD', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'premature', 'not', 'as', 'impactful', 'seeing', 'now', 'going', 'long', 'time', 'good', 'Celtics', 'fill', 'did', 'seem', 'have', 'problem', 'narrator', 'first', 'seemed', 'kind', 'dull', 'However', 'got', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'show', 'grow', 'point', 'where', 'nicely', 'delivery', 'flow', 'perfect.An', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'opinion', 'well', 'Celtics', 'fan', 'one', 'collection', 'will', 'be', 'compliment', 'box', 'set', 'due', 'November']",2007-2008 NBA Champions: Boston Celtics

Schlueter ""martin blank""","[23, 25]","Having suffered through 22 years of decline and mediocrity since the last time the Celtics were in the NBA Finals, no one could have been happier than me when I heard a DVD of the championship season was going to be released.The best things about the DVD are the extras.  You get to see the final QUARTERS of the Semi-Finals against the Cavs and Conference Finals against the Pistons.  You are also treated to the interview between Kevin Garnett and Bill Russell, like two eras in the same room together.  There are a couple of other small extras, but nothing noteworthy.The rest of the DVD is a 60 minute recap of the 2008 season and playoff run.  It flows nicely and it has a lot of ""behind the scenes"" stuff as well.  By that, I mean you hear some huddle conversation, post game locker room chatter and the like.  But it's nothing special.  I did enjoy the snippet that Doc Rivers explains the term ""umbuntu"", which becomes the Celtics' mantra for the season.But, for $17, I would have hoped for a little more, especially when it comes to the playoffs.  I would have liked to see a lot more of the historic comeback in Game 4 against the Lakers.  I would have liked to see some highlights from the All-Star game, which the Big Three all attended.If you sre a Celtics fan, it is a nice video for posterity.  And there isn't anything BAD about it.  But I think for the money, the fans deserve a little more than what we get.  Like I said, it moves along nicely.  But it really doesn't seem like anything special.Should you buy it?

But knowing that this DVD came out not long after the Finals, I knew it wouldn't be that great. It's obvious that they left out a lot of things that could have been compiled, had they waited and done a better job. Well, that's what you get when things are done in a rush just to get the product out and make fast bucks.The main feature is well done, but don't count on enjoying the extras as much. They have the Playoffs' 4th quarter of the games against Cleveland and Detroit. What about the final game against the Lakers? I could do without the 4th quarter videos, if they had the whole last game against the Lakers. Or do something like the ""Boston Celtics 1985-86 Champions"" box and include all the Finals' games.How about something on ""Gino Time"", the American Bandstand video that had everybody dancing on home wins?There was also only one of the 2 or 3 videos NBA had on their site featuring conversations between Bill Russell and Kevin Garnett.In the end, it was a DVD that will remind you of the season you just watched, but not something that will give you goosebumps and make you relive all the emotions in the future.",3,Just Ok.,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,1280,"['Having', 'watched', 'most', 'Celtics', 'games', 'season', 'Playoffs', 'expected', 'relive', 'same', 'emotion', 'experienced', 'last', 'november', 'knowing', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'not', 'long', 'Finals', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'obvious', 'left', 'out', 'lot', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'compiled', 'had', 'waited', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'Well', 'what', 'get', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'rush', 'just', 'get', 'product', 'make', 'fast', 'bucks.The', 'main', 'feature', 'well', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'enjoying', 'extras', 'much', 'have', 'Playoffs', '4th', 'quarter', 'games', 'Cleveland', 'Detroit', 'What', 'final', 'game', 'Lakers', 'could', 'do', '4th', 'quarter', 'videos', 'had', 'whole', 'last', 'game', 'Lakers', 'do', 'something', 'Boston', 'Celtics', '1985-86', 'Champions', 'box', 'include', 'Finals', 'games.How', 'something', 'Gino', 'Time', 'American', 'Bandstand', 'video', 'had', 'everybody', 'dancing', 'home', 'wins', 'was', 'also', 'only', 'one', '2', '3', 'videos', 'NBA', 'had', 'site', 'featuring', 'conversations', 'Bill', 'Russell', 'Kevin', 'Garnett.In', 'end', 'was', 'DVD', 'will', 'remind', 'season', 'just', 'watched', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'give', 'goosebumps', 'make', 'relive', 'emotions', 'future']",2007-2008 NBA Champions: Boston Celtics
