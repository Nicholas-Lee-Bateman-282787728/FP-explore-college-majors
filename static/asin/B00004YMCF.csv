559426,A595T15OO91DC,B00004YMCF,,"[3, 4]","First the criticism: this movie is so chock full of stereotypes and - believe it or not - cliches, it isn't funny.  From the opening of the bay door in the beginning to finding electricity that works to finding cops who let you rave on, it never lets up.  But, then again, that is from the point of view of what makes a 'good' movie.Now for the good news.  If you've been a raver, wanna be raver, pseudo raver or someone just curious, it's all about the music, the groove and freeing yourself through dance.  This movie rates way high for all of the above.  The movie is just a vehicle to showcase the music.  You've got more cliches - the wannabe DJ (why is it that he looks like DJ QBert?), the crazy haired chick DJ, the geek DJ and John Digweed making a (great) cameo - all spinning music.  Again, while they are caricatures (even Digweed, a caricature of the superstar DJ), they are vehicles to the music.Showing this through the eyes of an uptight business writer was relatively clever but all of the other characters are pretty much uninteresting.  I didn't really care a whole lot about what was up.  Perhaps you'll find yourself in some of the types.  Overall though, they - and the rave scene as a whole - come across as a bunch of drug using, sensation oriented, can't get high enough bunch of people.  Perhaps this is more true than we care to admit.If you've been to one rave or been to a bunch of raves, you'll find yourself right back there and feeling that urge to move.  In all honesty, though, I could've left the movie behind and stuck with the music and the visuals.  But sit back, watch and smile, and have some fun.  Just don't expect much depth.By the way, 'the end of rave culture' simply means that once something pure has gone mainstream, it is on the decline.  When mainstream books and movies find their way into a large audience it has become - and this is a negative - popular.",4,The end of rave culture...,1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,1907,"['First', 'criticism', 'movie', 'so', 'chock', 'full', 'stereotypes', 'believe', 'not', 'cliches', ""n't"", 'funny', 'opening', 'bay', 'door', 'beginning', 'finding', 'electricity', 'finding', 'cops', 'who', 'let', 'rave', 'never', 'up', 'then', 'again', 'point', 'view', 'what', ""'good"", 'movie.Now', 'good', 'news', ""'ve"", 'been', 'raver', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'raver', 'pseudo', 'raver', 'someone', 'just', 'curious', 'music', 'groove', 'freeing', 'dance', 'movie', 'rates', 'way', 'high', 'above', 'movie', 'just', 'vehicle', 'showcase', 'music', ""'ve"", 'got', 'more', 'cliches', 'wannabe', 'DJ', 'why', 'DJ', 'QBert', 'crazy', 'haired', 'chick', 'DJ', 'geek', 'DJ', 'John', 'Digweed', 'making', 'great', 'cameo', 'spinning', 'music', 'Again', 'are', 'caricatures', 'even', 'Digweed', 'caricature', 'superstar', 'DJ', 'are', 'vehicles', 'music.Showing', 'eyes', 'uptight', 'business', 'writer', 'was', 'relatively', 'clever', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'uninteresting', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'whole', 'lot', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'Perhaps', ""'ll"", 'find', 'types', 'Overall', 'rave', 'scene', 'whole', 'come', 'bunch', 'drug', 'using', 'sensation', 'oriented', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'high', 'enough', 'bunch', 'people', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'true', 'care', 'admit.If', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'rave', 'been', 'bunch', 'raves', ""'ll"", 'find', 'right', 'back', 'there', 'feeling', 'urge', 'move', 'honesty', 'could', ""'ve"", 'left', 'movie', 'stuck', 'music', 'visuals', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'smile', 'have', 'fun', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'way', ""'the"", 'end', 'rave', 'culture', 'simply', 'once', 'something', 'pure', 'gone', 'mainstream', 'decline', 'When', 'mainstream', 'books', 'movies', 'find', 'way', 'large', 'audience', 'become', 'negative', 'popular']",N/A

559428,A1ZXFB39UJQUIN,B00004YMCF,Chris,"[34, 38]","The movie from a storyline standpoint is intruiging since there aren't many movies of this sort to choose from in the &quot;electronic dance&quot; (rave) scene. The movie is pretty short, although that isn't the real problem with it.The actual dialogue between the characters seemed a bit forced, such as the exchange between the promoter and one of his buddies who questions why he goes through the hassle of putting parties together anyway. Other aspects such as acting, and I hate to pick on the DJs but snaz and digweed seemed to me like they were trying to act as DJs, not actually being them, slowed the film down a bit.The energy brought into Leyla's character was a nice boost to the movie, and the scene where Dave is outside beginning to feel the effects did make me feel a bit queasy :)The film did a good job on trying to develop characters throughout the party instead of developing them beforehand and watching how they react to the different situations that occur. A nice twist since there have been many times where me and my friends will go and be completely open with people we've never met before. So, the film kind of caught a special element of the scene, which was a nice plus.It seemed most aspects were covered in the movie....there were the candy ravers, the kid who just went so he could take as many drugs as possible, the guy who goes solely for the purpose of hooking up, the first timer, the sober veteran who watches after the first timer, the happy-yet-really unstable raver girl, the ravers who go just to hear their favorite DJ, and of course, the DJs themselves. Some of these characters were developed and represented nicely, but as noted before some of the lines they were fed seem to be more pointed towards people who have no idea what goes on in the scene...a &quot;How to...&quot; if you will.Another neat aspect of the movie was the actual switching of the DJs themselves, and how they all had their own styles to bring. There was Snaz, who at times did a good job of representing the DJ who had to get the music going before the partiers had arrived, made some rookie spinning mistakes when they did come, only to give way to crowd-pleasing DJs who have an enormous amount of confidence in their abilities. A particular interesting turn came for Snaz, who had to perform an anxiety-riddled second set because another one of the DJs had a serious problem which prevented him from going on.I'm glad the DJs themselves got their deserving chunk in the movie, since they are an ever-growing phenomenon in the industry. When Polywog turned up the volume during &quot;Twenty Minutes of Disco Glory&quot; at the build-up point, it reminded me of everything that is fun about the dance scene in general.To summarize all this non-sense.....this movie could have been made better, but not all groundbreakers are masterpieces. If you've never been to a rave before, this would definitely be an interesting one to check out. If you have, it makes a good start to a collection that will hopefully grow as more and more people realize that the underground-yet-coming-up dance scene offers much more to the mind, body, and spirit than TRL on MTV ever will.",3,Vibrant yet cheesy,976060800,"12 6, 2000",2000,3184,"['movie', 'storyline', 'standpoint', 'intruiging', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'movies', 'sort', 'choose', 'quot', 'electronic', 'dance', 'quot', 'rave', 'scene', 'movie', 'pretty', 'short', ""n't"", 'real', 'problem', 'it.The', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'seemed', 'bit', 'forced', 'such', 'exchange', 'promoter', 'one', 'buddies', 'who', 'questions', 'why', 'hassle', 'putting', 'parties', 'together', 'anyway', 'Other', 'aspects', 'such', 'acting', 'hate', 'pick', 'DJs', 'snaz', 'digweed', 'seemed', 'were', 'trying', 'act', 'DJs', 'not', 'actually', 'being', 'slowed', 'film', 'down', 'bit.The', 'energy', 'brought', 'Leyla', 'character', 'was', 'nice', 'boost', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'Dave', 'outside', 'beginning', 'feel', 'effects', 'did', 'make', 'feel', 'bit', 'queasy', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'trying', 'develop', 'characters', 'party', 'instead', 'developing', 'beforehand', 'watching', 'how', 'react', 'different', 'situations', 'occur', 'nice', 'twist', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'times', 'where', 'friends', 'will', 'go', 'be', 'completely', 'open', 'people', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'before', 'So', 'film', 'kind', 'caught', 'special', 'element', 'scene', 'was', 'nice', 'plus.It', 'seemed', 'most', 'aspects', 'were', 'covered', 'movie', 'were', 'candy', 'ravers', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'went', 'so', 'could', 'take', 'many', 'drugs', 'possible', 'guy', 'who', 'solely', 'purpose', 'hooking', 'up', 'first', 'timer', 'sober', 'veteran', 'who', 'first', 'timer', 'happy-yet-really', 'unstable', 'raver', 'girl', 'ravers', 'who', 'go', 'just', 'hear', 'favorite', 'DJ', 'course', 'DJs', 'characters', 'were', 'developed', 'represented', 'nicely', 'noted', 'lines', 'were', 'fed', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'pointed', 'towards', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'scene', 'quot', 'How', 'quot', 'will.Another', 'neat', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'actual', 'switching', 'DJs', 'how', 'had', 'own', 'styles', 'bring', 'was', 'Snaz', 'who', 'times', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'representing', 'DJ', 'who', 'had', 'get', 'music', 'going', 'partiers', 'had', 'arrived', 'made', 'rookie', 'spinning', 'mistakes', 'when', 'did', 'come', 'only', 'give', 'way', 'crowd-pleasing', 'DJs', 'who', 'have', 'enormous', 'amount', 'confidence', 'abilities', 'particular', 'interesting', 'turn', 'came', 'Snaz', 'who', 'had', 'perform', 'anxiety-riddled', 'second', 'set', 'one', 'DJs', 'had', 'serious', 'problem', 'prevented', 'going', 'on.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'DJs', 'got', 'deserving', 'chunk', 'movie', 'are', 'ever-growing', 'phenomenon', 'industry', 'When', 'Polywog', 'turned', 'up', 'volume', 'quot', 'Twenty', 'Minutes', 'Disco', 'Glory', 'quot', 'build-up', 'point', 'reminded', 'everything', 'fun', 'dance', 'scene', 'general.To', 'summarize', 'non-sense', '..this', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'better', 'not', 'groundbreakers', 'are', 'masterpieces', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'rave', 'before', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'interesting', 'one', 'check', 'out', 'have', 'good', 'start', 'collection', 'will', 'hopefully', 'grow', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'realize', 'underground-yet-coming-up', 'dance', 'scene', 'much', 'more', 'mind', 'body', 'spirit', 'TRL', 'MTV', 'ever', 'will']",N/A
559429,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B00004YMCF,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[1, 3]","This Sundance fave is basically 48 hours at a San Francisco Rave. In the 60's there were `Happenings', in the 80's there were house parties, and in the 90's we have Raves.  A lot of Raves are run by folks who merely want to throw the best dance party you've ever been too.  They aren't interested in getting rich from Raves or running an underground version of Studio 54(though some people exist that try).  There's a sense of community and a shared joy of the driving beats of the electronic, techno music that takes the old Kraftwerk sound to new heights of....  Well ecstasy ... as in the drug of course and very popular among Ravers.  So it nitrous, as in laughing gas.  So are power drinks-vitamin/fruit juice concoctions.  So is bottled water-drugs and fast dancing can dehydrate you, you know.Groove is about an Underground Rave party. We briefly meet a handful of character types who plan on going to the Rave.  Some behind the scenes at the Rave, and then various characters interact at the party all night long RAVE.There's five main characters in the film, a half dozen minor ones and some extras. Rave promoter (Steve Van Wormer) approves the location, coordinates the fast make-over of the warehouse into a party palace and later diverts a nosy policeman, re-organizes a Rave part 2 and keeps a handle on a potential drug overdose.  He does it not to make money, but for `the nod'. Which is a sincere genuine appreciation from at least one person who has attended the Rave he's organized.  The word that a Rave is on is spread via, e-mail, and personal messages among a cult group of Ravers alert attendees.  Party goers will meet a guy in a car in a quiet part of town, pay a couple bucks  and get directions to where the Rave is being held.David (Hamish Linklater) is a technical writer whose ready to write his first novel. His younger brother Colin (Denny Kirkwood) is an experienced Raver who insists  insists David (who's a Rave virgin) go with him to the latest Rave. David really doesn't want to go, but Colin tells him it's important he is there because he wants it to be a very special evening him and  his girlfriend (MacKenzie Firgens).  It's no surprise he intends to propose to the girl at the Rave.There's also Leyla (Lola Glaudini), a New York woman, new to the Bay Area  who's not found a focus or purpose in her life yet, even though some of her former wild party friends have settled down.  She's a 90's version of a grounded 60's flower-child, 80's new-ager. She dresses borderline goth.  Eventually she'll make an impression on David with her exotic look and help him have a pleasant and safe experience after he takes Ecstacy with his brother and girlfriend.  A romance blossoms.Anyway, that's about all there is to Groove.  That is its charm.  There isn't a lot going on.  A handful of characters interacting at an underground Rave. It's told from the perspective of Ravers and so we see the lighter, kinder side of Raves.  There's no anti-drug messages here and there's a very naive youthful idealism emanating from the writer/director and the characters we meet.  There's a nice tight, semi-documentary type style employed by first time feature film director Gregory Harrison (who's done some documentaries).  His actors aren't very experienced, and at times this really shows.  At times the script is downright corny and loopy.  Some of the comic moments (particularly with the gay couple who are late and get lost on their way to the Rave) are forced and don't work very well.The music is the a mix of mostly `house' type techno music.  We see real life dj's spinning some grooves during the film.  There isn't any exciting choreography or show-boat dancing going on in the film.If you want a fairly authentic look at a mellow RAVE happening, this film gives you that with some cliched characters, corniness and hardly a negative message spoken. It's almost pro-drug and glamorizes drug use somewhat with a couple of messages about being careful and responsible about what you take and with whom.  The film is far too safe to get excited about on any level.  It purposely is ambiguous about any possible purpose it might have other than.. Here's a Rave... they aren't wild orgies or places where everyone goes nuts using drugs, but they are young people hanging out, unwinding, experimenting a bit and moving a bit to loud music.A nod and a shrug.  It's an okay film.  2 and a half stars rounded up to a 3.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

Litton,"[3, 9]","So a bunch of guys send out an email about a massive party taking place in an abandoned building in the city, which gets forwarded and forwarded by countless receivers during the opening credits as preparations are made for the event. Terrific amounts of people show up, dance, have a good time... the extras dancing in such shots probably had a better experience making &quot;Groove&quot; than audiences will have watching it.The film tries to break new ground with its focus on the lives of various individuals throughout the rave, giving us a glimpse of the so-called underground of such parties. I've been to such parties, and have had more fun than I can remember, but in watching &quot;Groove,&quot; I felt like I was missing out on the fun and excitement, rather than enjoying it.Beginning with the aforementioned sequence of events, the movie then takes us to the actual party, during which various DJs will play various amounts of music, though most of which quickly grows exhausting as it plays during most of the film's moments. It also takes a look at various people, like a novelist who spends the night getting to know a girl completely out of his league, a young couple who come across complications in their relationship, countless drug abusers, and a gay couple who spend the whole night trying to locate the party, but doing little else.The film makes the big mistake of giving us absolutely no reason to care for any of these characters. In fact, their existence in the film seems more like an excuse for the various shots of bright-colored hair, strobe light dancers getting their groove on to the endless music, all thanks to some chopping editing from director/writer/editor Greg Harrison, who seems to have little concern for giving any of these people some plausible amount of emotional depth.Harrison seems more adept at creating the rave scene with striking authenticity, and he accomplishes this with attention to small details through the music and through the use of drugs and mind-bending substances.

The movie is about the underground raver scene in San Fransisco, and the young people who like to party. There were small storylines through the movie, that were engaging and interesting to watch. Maybe the movie isn't a perfect reflection of the rave scene, but it was an interesting movie nonetheless, and many of the ideas presented were very interesting.

Well, walking out of the theatre, numerous violent images came into my head, directed towards the people in the theatre who were telling me how &quot;tight&quot; the movie was, the pseudo-ravers who I happen to run into everyday, and the makers of this film.Like watching a train wreck, I viewed &quot;Groove&quot; once more afterwards, with the security of a stop-button in my hand (and the fact that I get free rentals for being an employee of a video store).  The DVD isn't half-bad.  But...it does nothing to change my already-negative opinion.  (&quot;Fight Club&quot; however converted me thanks to the DVD).Well, on to the review.  The makers of this film act as if they have been to one party before and have watched hundreds of Dateline specials about the film.  They try to capture the essence of the rave generation by putting some psycological meaning towards it.  They also poorly capture the feeling of being at a rave.  I felt like I was watching an electronic special episode of &quot;Days of Our Lives.&quot;  &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; would have captured the scene better (and I hear they have tried).  Each of the characters are one-dimmensional and say the most absurd dialogue throughout the film (remember the conversation where Steve Von Wormer talks about 'The Nod'?).  The actors are all under-trained, especially the young woman who catches her fiance kissing another guy.  I didn't waste any of my brain to remember her name.For a truly painful experience, enjoyed only by those who either don't have any knowledge of good filmmaking or who feel that they are going against their generation by disliking the film, see &quot;Groove.&quot;",1,"Hands down, the worst film of the year 2000.",981849600,"02 11, 2001",2001,2161,"['reading', 'title', 'review', 'know', 'declaring', 'low-budget', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'entry', 'worst', 'bold', 'statement', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'did', 'come', 'out', 'few', 'movies', 'last', 'year', 'going', 'city', 'local', 'artsy', 'film', 'theatre', 'yes', 'read', 'correctly', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'depict', 'kids', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'relate', 'hundreds', 'teenage', 'flicks', 'quot', 'That', 'quot', 'quot', 'Clueless', 'quot', 'etc', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'Well', 'walking', 'theatre', 'numerous', 'violent', 'images', 'came', 'head', 'directed', 'people', 'theatre', 'who', 'were', 'telling', 'how', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie', 'was', 'pseudo-ravers', 'who', 'happen', 'run', 'everyday', 'makers', 'film.Like', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'viewed', 'quot', 'Groove', 'quot', 'once', 'more', 'afterwards', 'security', 'stop-button', 'hand', 'fact', 'get', 'free', 'rentals', 'being', 'employee', 'video', 'store', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'half-bad', 'nothing', 'change', 'already-negative', 'opinion', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'however', 'converted', 'thanks', 'DVD', '.Well', 'review', 'makers', 'film', 'act', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'party', 'have', 'watched', 'hundreds', 'Dateline', 'specials', 'film', 'try', 'capture', 'essence', 'rave', 'generation', 'putting', 'psycological', 'meaning', 'towards', 'also', 'poorly', 'capture', 'feeling', 'being', 'rave', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'electronic', 'special', 'episode', 'quot', 'Days', 'Lives.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'captured', 'scene', 'better', 'hear', 'have', 'tried', 'characters', 'are', 'one-dimmensional', 'say', 'most', 'absurd', 'dialogue', 'film', 'remember', 'conversation', 'where', 'Steve', 'Von', 'Wormer', 'talks', ""'The"", 'Nod', 'actors', 'are', 'under-trained', 'especially', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'fiance', 'kissing', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'brain', 'remember', 'name.For', 'truly', 'painful', 'experience', 'enjoyed', 'only', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'knowledge', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'who', 'feel', 'are', 'going', 'generation', 'disliking', 'film', 'see', 'quot', 'Groove.', 'quot']",N/A

But between the beginning and end, we get introduced to all these different characters, but he only skims the surface and we never learn much about them.

Visually stunning, highly addictive rave music, and an excellent script and cast, the film ""nearly jumps off the screen,"" as a writer for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine described it.The film's cast which includes Rachel True (""CB4""; ""Half-Baked""; ""The Craft""), Denny Kirkwood (""Never Been Kissed"") and Steve Van Wormer (""Idle Hands"") are all fantastic, as well as the many actors who were casted via casting calls in the San Francisco area. The appearance of many popular rave/techno deejays such as DJ Polywog and DJ Digweed also add realism and authencity to this great film. However, the two scene stealers in this film have to be Lola Glaudini who plays ""Leyla"" and Hamish Linklater who plays ""David"" a workaholic writer who can't seem to enjoy a good time. Their encounter, and instant romance was the film's main subplot, and it made the film a feel-good movie at the conclusion. Ms. Glaudini who has appeared on television's ""NYPD Blue"" is one of today's talented young actresses, and after seeing her in this film, I anticipate a promising career in the near future.Just like the film's tagline, ""Are you feeling it?"", I definitely felt the force of this independent feature film. When I read that the Catholic Archdiocese of New York City classified this film as morally offensive, I ran off to see even more so, however I found nothing offensive about it. As a Catholic, I probably will be casted to hell, however if so, I have no regrets in seeing this film. If you liked the film, I highly recommend its' soundtrack as well.

I think that's the only way to describe it. I also loved the DJ scenes.. especially when Pollywog does her thing!

559450,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B00004YMCF,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[1, 1]","Groove, released in 2000, exposes through director Greg Harrison's eye a fragment of the San Francisco's underground electronic music scene and the glittery aliens that then inhabited it.  I found the effort to be genuine and mostly successful.I logged a fairly lengthy tour in this world, and had just bowed out of it when I found this movie shortly after its release back in 2000.  Desperate for some semblance, I committed myself to what I hoped would be a just cinematic representation and was left a tad dejected.  The movie was promptly shelved and forgotten about.  This year, however, I decided to pop it in again and found it to be much more enjoyable.  The first time I watched was out of desperation, the second time was out of sweet nostalgia. I was inspired to write the review because of this.The film, in a nutshell, spotlights an underground party and the results of its gravity.  Detailed are the organizational group efforts of the people that bring life to such a thing, followed by the adventures of its followers.  Anyone that has spent a night under the influence of a warehouse party and its accompanying elements will find something in this movie to smile about.  I was particularly attracted to scenes in the chill room, (or red room, where I'm from), because it felt real to me.  I remember fondly having similarly peaceful conversations amongst friends and strangers in this environment exactly.I felt that true homage was paged to the DJs in this movie.  I also thought the director did a ample job addressing what it means to stand behind a set of turntables.  It's not just fader tossing.  The specifics of mixing weren't covered, but honestly, the only people interested in that are the people that already know how to DO it.  Anyone else is just there for a good time.I wasn't a huge fan of the music, as it wasn't what I orbited around when I was partying, but I imagine it would translate well to anyone watching the movie, whether experienced in this genre or not.At the risk of sounding verbose, I'll leave the individual stories contained in this story to the watcher.  Just know that there are a series of relationships outlined here, old or established that night, and they're all believable enough to make the project endearing.The only problem I had with this movie, and it's cause for my rating, is the sporadic cheese that pops up throughout the film.  The interactions between the gay couple is highly stereotypical which makes their presence feel awkward.  Likewise, I suspected the main protagonist, played by Hamish Linklater, of over-acting at times.  I get that he's supposed to be high, but I'm guessing his on-screen unease had nothing to do with drug use.The ascent of Gouda Mountain, however, happened when the party-thrower's assistant asks said party-thrower why he does what he does.  Feel free to fast-forward through one of the most unsatisfying speeches concering voluntary head-movements in the history of American cinema.  I actually groaned.In the end, though, I think this is fine little movie and expect its harshest critics will come from those that either spent no time in this scene, or expected too much from a film with obvious limitations.I think it's well worth the low prices I'm seeing here.- t-6 June, 2010",3,"Not a total submergence, but it did take me back.",1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,3280,"['Groove', 'released', '2000', 'director', 'Greg', 'Harrison', 'eye', 'fragment', 'San', 'Francisco', 'underground', 'electronic', 'music', 'scene', 'glittery', 'then', 'inhabited', 'found', 'effort', 'be', 'genuine', 'mostly', 'logged', 'fairly', 'lengthy', 'tour', 'world', 'had', 'just', 'bowed', 'when', 'found', 'movie', 'shortly', 'release', 'back', '2000', 'Desperate', 'semblance', 'committed', 'what', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'cinematic', 'representation', 'was', 'left', 'tad', 'dejected', 'movie', 'was', 'promptly', 'shelved', 'forgotten', 'about', 'year', 'however', 'decided', 'pop', 'again', 'found', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'desperation', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'sweet', 'nostalgia', 'was', 'inspired', 'write', 'review', 'this.The', 'film', 'nutshell', 'spotlights', 'underground', 'party', 'results', 'gravity', 'Detailed', 'are', 'organizational', 'group', 'efforts', 'people', 'bring', 'life', 'thing', 'followed', 'adventures', 'followers', 'Anyone', 'spent', 'night', 'influence', 'warehouse', 'party', 'accompanying', 'elements', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'movie', 'smile', 'was', 'particularly', 'attracted', 'scenes', 'chill', 'room', 'red', 'room', 'where', ""'m"", 'felt', 'real', 'remember', 'fondly', 'having', 'similarly', 'peaceful', 'conversations', 'amongst', 'friends', 'strangers', 'environment', 'exactly.I', 'felt', 'true', 'homage', 'was', 'paged', 'DJs', 'movie', 'also', 'thought', 'director', 'did', 'ample', 'job', 'addressing', 'what', 'stand', 'set', 'turntables', 'not', 'just', 'fader', 'tossing', 'specifics', 'mixing', 'were', ""n't"", 'covered', 'honestly', 'only', 'people', 'interested', 'are', 'people', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'DO', 'Anyone', 'else', 'just', 'good', 'time.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'orbited', 'when', 'was', 'partying', 'imagine', 'would', 'translate', 'well', 'anyone', 'watching', 'movie', 'experienced', 'genre', 'not.At', 'risk', 'sounding', 'verbose', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'individual', 'stories', 'contained', 'story', 'watcher', 'Just', 'know', 'are', 'series', 'relationships', 'outlined', 'here', 'old', 'established', 'night', ""'re"", 'believable', 'enough', 'make', 'project', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'cause', 'rating', 'sporadic', 'cheese', 'up', 'film', 'interactions', 'gay', 'couple', 'highly', 'stereotypical', 'presence', 'feel', 'awkward', 'Likewise', 'suspected', 'main', 'protagonist', 'played', 'Hamish', 'Linklater', 'over-acting', 'times', 'get', 'supposed', 'be', 'high', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'on-screen', 'unease', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'drug', 'use.The', 'ascent', 'Gouda', 'Mountain', 'however', 'happened', 'when', 'party-thrower', 'assistant', 'asks', 'said', 'party-thrower', 'why', 'what', 'Feel', 'free', 'fast-forward', 'one', 'most', 'unsatisfying', 'speeches', 'concering', 'voluntary', 'head-movements', 'history', 'American', 'cinema', 'actually', 'groaned.In', 'end', 'think', 'fine', 'little', 'movie', 'expect', 'harshest', 'critics', 'will', 'come', 'spent', 'time', 'scene', 'expected', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'obvious', 'limitations.I', 'think', 'well', 'low', 'prices', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'here.-', 't-6', 'June', '2010']",N/A
