878975,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B00079I09W,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[13, 18]","This is an anime about high-schoolers with super powers. Wow, that's the most amazing thing I've ever heard twenty times. Seriously, this type of anime has been done almost as often as the giant-robot type of anime, only without as much success. In fact, should you ask me, I'd say that Tenjho Tenge is the best in this genre of anime. But that's isn't saying in anyway its a perfect anime (Evangelion is a perfect anime, and the absolute best in the genre).The worst part of this anime is the characters. They, all of them, have been done before. There's the main protagonist with hidden powers, his sidekick, a mentor/love interest, a girl with a crush on the protagonist, and many all-powerful bad guys that the characters seem to overcome despite being vastly weaker than them, plus an over-lord type antagonist that makes an appearance later. It seems that, when the creators sat down, they took a formula plot, added names to all the cliches, and went with the idea until they ran out of cool ideas for bad guys.Another bad part about this anime is the animation. Not only are all the women drawn with ridiculously large breasts, but the animation is generic and not as varied as I like. There must be differences between the characters, and as of this moment the only character that is actually different is the black character Bob.Now, with most of the negatives out of the way, there are a few standout features in this anime. First, the opening credits are incredibly attractive, with all those characters dancing to a great soundtrack. Second, the action here is awesome and brutal, though sometimes interspersed with redundant bad guy talk (who isn't tired of the long expository moments where the bad guy reveals his powers with words and not with actions). Thirdly, there is quite a bit of fan-service, meaning bouncing breasts, almost naked women, men in tight fighting outfits, and even a romance in progress, making Tenjho Tenge appealing to all sexes.The story itself is also decent (though still not original). Two students transfer from their old school, where they were the best fighters, to their new school, where they promptly catch quite the butt-whooping at the hands of one of the smaller ""fighting clubs."" Thus, they begin their training with the Juken Club (the one responsible for the butt-whooping) to overcome their weaknesses, but in the process they make enemies with the Student Executive Council, the most powerful fighters in the school, and find themselves in numerous life and death battles. And all of the enemies, despite their numbers, seem to have a history, making them only slightly more realistic. Also involved are two voluptuous sisters, one making up for her past, the other attempting to make a future, and a boy whose brother runs the Student Executive Council.Pros and Cons Key:+ Good opening credits+ Great actions when it's actually happening+ Plenty of fan-service for all kinds of people+ Decent story- Too much chat in action scenes- Generic animation meant solely for fan-service- As used a plot as there ever wasIf you're a fan of high school beat-em ups, this is probably one of the best. If you're into the most basic of story and enjoy solid action, Tenjho Tenge is one of the best. If you like great anime with that is excellent all around, then I wouldn't recommend this.",3,High Schoolers With Super Powers,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,3335,"['anime', 'high-schoolers', 'super', 'powers', 'Wow', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'twenty', 'times', 'Seriously', 'type', 'anime', 'been', 'done', 'almost', 'as', 'often', 'giant-robot', 'type', 'anime', 'only', 'as', 'much', 'success', 'fact', 'should', 'ask', ""'d"", 'say', 'Tenjho', 'Tenge', 'best', 'genre', 'anime', ""n't"", 'saying', 'anyway', 'perfect', 'anime', 'Evangelion', 'perfect', 'anime', 'absolute', 'best', 'genre', '.The', 'worst', 'part', 'anime', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'main', 'protagonist', 'hidden', 'powers', 'sidekick', 'mentor/love', 'interest', 'girl', 'crush', 'protagonist', 'many', 'all-powerful', 'bad', 'guys', 'characters', 'seem', 'overcome', 'being', 'vastly', 'weaker', 'over-lord', 'type', 'antagonist', 'appearance', 'later', 'when', 'creators', 'sat', 'down', 'took', 'formula', 'plot', 'added', 'names', 'cliches', 'went', 'idea', 'ran', 'cool', 'ideas', 'bad', 'guys.Another', 'bad', 'part', 'anime', 'animation', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'women', 'drawn', 'ridiculously', 'large', 'breasts', 'animation', 'generic', 'not', 'as', 'varied', 'like', 'must', 'be', 'differences', 'characters', 'moment', 'only', 'character', 'actually', 'different', 'black', 'character', 'Bob.Now', 'most', 'negatives', 'way', 'are', 'few', 'standout', 'features', 'anime', 'First', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'incredibly', 'attractive', 'characters', 'dancing', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Second', 'action', 'here', 'awesome', 'brutal', 'sometimes', 'interspersed', 'redundant', 'bad', 'guy', 'talk', 'who', ""n't"", 'tired', 'long', 'expository', 'moments', 'where', 'bad', 'guy', 'powers', 'words', 'not', 'actions', 'Thirdly', 'quite', 'bit', 'fan-service', 'meaning', 'bouncing', 'breasts', 'almost', 'naked', 'women', 'men', 'tight', 'fighting', 'outfits', 'even', 'romance', 'progress', 'making', 'Tenjho', 'Tenge', 'appealing', 'sexes.The', 'story', 'also', 'decent', 'still', 'not', 'original', 'Two', 'students', 'transfer', 'old', 'school', 'where', 'were', 'best', 'fighters', 'new', 'school', 'where', 'promptly', 'catch', 'quite', 'butt-whooping', 'hands', 'one', 'smaller', 'fighting', 'clubs', 'Thus', 'begin', 'training', 'Juken', 'Club', 'one', 'responsible', 'butt-whooping', 'overcome', 'weaknesses', 'process', 'make', 'enemies', 'Student', 'Executive', 'Council', 'most', 'powerful', 'fighters', 'school', 'find', 'numerous', 'life', 'death', 'battles', 'enemies', 'numbers', 'seem', 'have', 'history', 'making', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'realistic', 'Also', 'involved', 'are', 'two', 'voluptuous', 'sisters', 'one', 'making', 'up', 'past', 'other', 'attempting', 'make', 'future', 'boy', 'brother', 'Student', 'Executive', 'Council.Pros', 'Cons', 'Key', '+', 'Good', 'opening', 'credits+', 'Great', 'actions', 'when', 'actually', 'happening+', 'Plenty', 'fan-service', 'kinds', 'people+', 'Decent', 'story-', 'Too', 'much', 'chat', 'action', 'scenes-', 'Generic', 'animation', 'meant', 'solely', 'fan-service-', 'As', 'used', 'plot', 'there', 'ever', 'wasIf', ""'re"", 'fan', 'high', 'school', 'beat-em', 'ups', 'probably', 'one', 'best', ""'re"", 'most', 'basic', 'story', 'enjoy', 'solid', 'action', 'Tenjho', 'Tenge', 'one', 'best', 'like', 'great', 'anime', 'excellent', 'all', 'around', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend']",Tenjho Tenge - Round One

878978,A51P2XQQWE08K,B00079I09W,GuineaPunk,"[7, 10]","What if your old student council president decided to have you hunted down and punished to an extreme only known in kung-fu type shows like this, and by martial arts masters whom you could never defeat, no less? Join the club the first person who puts the hurt on you belongs to? Correctamundo. That's what Souichiro and Bob did.See, they came to this new school looking for a fight, right? Instead they get beat by a mild mannered geek, and then they are told that this geek who just beat the holy heck out of em is at the bottom end of the totem pole. There is more. A huge breasted girl who transforms into a kid to hide her strength is his master, and her sister, who is as well endowed as her sibling, falls madly in love with Souichiro after he crashes into the roof over which she is showering and lands on her. Then there is a guy who shoots fire from his hands, and a wrestler who can manipulate the joints in a person's body, and so on, I'm sure.Hey, these are only the first four episodes.My complaints: while the animation and character designs are above average, the fight sequences, usually the bread and butter of a show such as this, are not the best. Some fights are skipped altogether, only showing the loser lying on the ground with battle damage all over em, allowing you to guess how things went down. One odd bit I noticed was that in the subtitled version, Aya, one of the sisters, mentions to Bob, who is a black dude, that he should be proud because his race has such flexible muscles and natural strength and that running alot should be good enough for training. I don't know if that is verbatim from the original Japanese, but that is wierd. I think that is what old Charlie Solomon was talking about up top when he said something about ethnic stereotypes. Of course the character also uses breakdancing in his fighting style, and then there is the hip-hop-ish theme music. Hmm...Anyway, I'm kinda torn over this one. It was good, kept me glued to my seat, has semi-likable characters, and a good plotline that has a possibility of turning out some excellent fights, but the fights I have seen were short and with little effort in the coordination department. Also there are too many wierdnesses in it. I know that sounds funny, but it is true, and hard to explain.

I watched the first episode and almost turned it off but the fighting scenes were well done so I decided to give it a chance and watch the next episode.  After the first two episodes the show really begins to come together (the characters motivations are clearer and the stakes are raised).  By the third episode I was really getting into it.  And the fourth episode really made me begin rooting for the main characters (interesting sibling rivalries on this show--has the potential to be quite interesting if they don't mess it up).  The show has a lot of fan service (if you're into that sort of thing) and the fighting is strong (vomit, gore, bones being shattered etc...) although I hope the fights are more extended in the volumes to come.
