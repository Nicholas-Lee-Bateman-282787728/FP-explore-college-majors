I purchased this because this show was my favorite when it was on.  I made sure to tape it if I was going to be away when a new episode aired.  I even watched reruns of it on PAX for a while.So even though yes, it is split up, it is still here to purchase and when volume two of this season comes out, you can bet that I'll be buying that as well.I highly recommend this to any fan of TBAA.

Home Improvement has started down this path as well (with cheap packaging) because previous seasons have not been selling well. I can only guess the same is happening with Touched By An Angel. I don't think any of us want to see TBAA dissapear off the radar.

His past is uncovered and why he has been on the run is revealed. (2 hour episode)Great Expectations -The angel Taylor (Chris Burke) is back with Monica, Andrew, & Tess to help minister to a couple who finds out their unborn baby will be born mentally retarded.Nothing But Net-Rafael (Alexis Cruz) and the angel trio help a rude and cocky All-Star basketball player who is hiding his weaknesses from the world and is a bad influence to a special young fan.Children Of The Night-The Angels guide a group of teenagers who live on the street and are on the run in fear of being returned to their families.Jones vs. God-After a long drought and poor crops a man decides to sue God in a professional court hearing. A ridiculous premous but a touching ending as always.The Pact-The angels minister to a camp of girls designed specifically for young girls with HIV and AIDS.My Dinner With Andrew-Andrew is auctioned off as an eligible bachelor and the woman who wins the bid turn out to be the angels assignment.Charades-The angels arrive to help Libby Glaser, a powerful Hollywood agent, learn the truth about her Blacklisted father's last days.The Comeback-The Angels minister to Lillian (Carol Burnett) and give her self confidence after having a discouraging past in theater.Sandcastles-The angels search for a man named Benjamin (William Devane) and learn the truth of his past.Venice-Tess and Monica arrive in Montana to help the elderly Annie Doyle (Piper Laurie) reconcile her life before she loses her failing eyesight.It Came Upon A Midnight Clear-The angels return to Wayne and Joey and Monica tells Joey an assignment she had with Mark Twain.",5,"Split up, agian??",1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,2250,"['thought', 'would', 'update', 'review', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'complaining', 'Seasons', 'being', 'split', 'up', 'cheaper', 'packaging', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'started', 'down', 'path', 'as', 'well', 'cheap', 'packaging', 'previous', 'seasons', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'selling', 'well', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'same', 'happening', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'want', 'see', 'TBAA', 'dissapear', 'off', 'radar', 'really', 'need', 'support', 'show', 'make', 'sure', 'release', 'future', 'seasons.Here', 'list', 'episodes', 'set', 'Joe', 'Return-Nathaniel', 'father', 'suddenly', 'be', 'part', 'Nathaniel', 'life', 'again', 'past', 'uncovered', 'why', 'been', 'run', 'revealed', '2', 'hour', 'episode', 'Great', 'Expectations', '-The', 'angel', 'Taylor', 'Chris', 'Burke', 'back', 'Monica', 'Andrew', 'Tess', 'help', 'minister', 'couple', 'who', 'out', 'unborn', 'baby', 'will', 'be', 'born', 'mentally', 'retarded.Nothing', 'Net-Rafael', 'Alexis', 'Cruz', 'angel', 'trio', 'help', 'rude', 'cocky', 'All-Star', 'basketball', 'player', 'who', 'hiding', 'weaknesses', 'world', 'bad', 'influence', 'special', 'young', 'fan.Children', 'Night-The', 'Angels', 'guide', 'group', 'teenagers', 'who', 'live', 'street', 'are', 'run', 'fear', 'being', 'returned', 'families.Jones', 'God-After', 'long', 'drought', 'poor', 'crops', 'man', 'sue', 'God', 'professional', 'court', 'hearing', 'ridiculous', 'premous', 'touching', 'ending', 'always.The', 'Pact-The', 'angels', 'minister', 'camp', 'girls', 'designed', 'specifically', 'young', 'girls', 'HIV', 'AIDS.My', 'Dinner', 'Andrew-Andrew', 'auctioned', 'off', 'eligible', 'bachelor', 'woman', 'who', 'bid', 'out', 'be', 'angels', 'assignment.Charades-The', 'angels', 'arrive', 'help', 'Libby', 'Glaser', 'powerful', 'Hollywood', 'agent', 'learn', 'truth', 'Blacklisted', 'father', 'last', 'days.The', 'Comeback-The', 'Angels', 'minister', 'Lillian', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'give', 'self', 'confidence', 'having', 'discouraging', 'past', 'theater.Sandcastles-The', 'angels', 'search', 'man', 'named', 'Benjamin', 'William', 'Devane', 'learn', 'truth', 'past.Venice-Tess', 'Monica', 'arrive', 'Montana', 'help', 'elderly', 'Annie', 'Doyle', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'reconcile', 'life', 'failing', 'eyesight.It', 'Came', 'A', 'Midnight', 'Clear-The', 'angels', 'return', 'Wayne', 'Joey', 'Monica', 'Joey', 'assignment', 'had', 'Mark', 'Twain']","Touched by an Angel: Season 4, Vol. 1"

Instead of the traditional digi-pak packaging like most television series' come in (including the first four released packages of Touch By An Angel), this release is in a hard plastic casing that does not uniformly match the rest of the Series' release. This just does not look as well on a DVD shelf as it should.I'm not suprised this studio decided to change thier casing as well.
