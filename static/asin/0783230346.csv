I hope the book was a better story.The first part tells of the recruitment and training for a retired assassin. He will take part in a mountain climbing expedition on the north side of the Eiger mountain (a very difficult climb). His job is to determine who is the traitor among the other three men and eliminate them. (Believable?) We meet characters who are part of this story. It seems to be padded out by providing actions that seems unrealistic to me.When the training is complete he is sent to take part of the climbing team. We meet the others in this party. Can he figure out who is the guilty party and eliminate him in an ""accident""? There is a problem for this party, they ascend the cliff but have not marked out a return in case of danger. What will happen if he can't identify the guilty party? [Is this really the job of a paid assassin?]I think a poor plot will identify the guilty person as someone who seems the most unlikely. What then? Some of the action seems to be part of an obvious clich&eacute;. Did they have experienced writer for this film?

I was thinking, ""Why not just make the movie as a mountaineering one?"" That would have made for an awesome movie to absorb. The scenes were just impressive and awesome to watch; what a missed opportunity for Clint Eastwood to capitalize on. To make up for it, he actually did the stunts himself and made sure of the realism of his doings. It was again very impressive. Elsewhere, the girl, Jemima, was useless for the movie, but I liked George Kennedy's appearance. He livened things up for me. For a professional seasoned assassin, Clint Eastwood's character is sure clumsy in what he does. I think there was plenty of misogynism in this picture.

In fact, quite little is changed in this taut and thrilling tale of a once famous mountaineer and retired government assassin turned college art history professor who is forced back into the ""sanction"" business both by personal greed and crude manipulation by the spymaster of the clandestine government agency that requires his services.An American courier has been killed in Copenhagen, and he happened to an old friend of professor Jonathan Hemlock (Eastwood), who is seduced back into harms way by ""Control"", an albino ex-Nazi who now heads one of our most clandestine federal agencies.  Before long Hemlock is on his way to sanction one of the two assailants, and the chase is on.  By dint of coincidence, Control discovers that the other assailant is included in an international mountaineering party, which will assault Switzerland's  ""Eiger"" the coming summer.  Naturally, Hemlock is manipulated into preparing for the climb as a replacement climber.Once we finally make it to the mountain, the action is literally non-stop, quite accurate technically, and absolutely riveting to behold. As with previous sequences shot in the American southwest, the cinematography is superior, and the plot unfolds in a quite plausible and inevitably tragic fashion with no one necessarily spared as the frenzy reaches its natural conclusion. This is a terrific action film, with a great supporting cast that includes George Kennedy, Jack Cassidy, and bodybuilder Dan Howard in a bit role.This is great entertainment, and illustrates why Eastwood has been such a consistent box office draw for over forty years.

Clint is a retired assassin, and is somewhat short on the theory of mercy. In this way his character in The Eiger Sanction has more parallels to his other roles of that day than one would think.A renowned mountain climber in the public eye, Clint is chosen to join a multi-national climbing team facing off against the Eiger, one of the toughest climbs in Europe. The catch? International intrigue concerning a stolen formula and a man who killed one of Clint's best friends ... a man who'd saved his life, not to mention a threat to Clint himself from his past.George Kennedy and Jack Cassidy play important roles well.

The main interest of the movie is the wonderful photography....the movie is sort of an ultimate travelogue of spectacular mountains seen in vivid color and from astonishing angles, with camera work done from helicopters and small airplanes which ""get in close"" in almost a surgical way.""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975) did not go on to become a famous or honored movie listed among the ""classics"" of its time, but it deserves to be.""Jaws"" (1975) was made the same year (1975) as ""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975), and was also produced by Richard Zanuck and David Brown (Helen Gurley Brown's husband!), and also included music composed by composer John Williams.""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975) included heavyweight support talent, and the result was and still is a true winner.-----------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.",5,"""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975) starring Clint Eastwood is a spectacular ""mountain movie""...a true classic!",1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,3223,"['Eiger', 'Sanction', '1975', 'starring', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'spectacular', 'mountain', 'movie', 'sort', 'big', '1920', 'German', 'classic', 'cinema.The', 'famous', '1929', 'German', 'movie', 'titled', 'White', 'Hell', 'Pitz', 'Palou', '1929', 'Germany', 'starring', 'young', 'Leni', 'Riefenshahl', 'directed', 'Joseph', 'Pabst', 'example', 'German', 'mountain', 'movies', 'always', 'included', 'spectacular', 'camera', 'work', 'recording', 'breathtaking', 'icy', 'mountain', 'scenes', 'most', 'often', 'European', 'Alps.World', 'audiences', 'were', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'mountain', 'movies', 'few', 'were', 'made', 'sound', 'movies', 'replaced', 'silent', 'movies', 'Eiger', 'Sanction', '1975', 'exception', 'spectacular', 'one.About', '50', 'percent', 'movie', 'taken', 'up', 'incredible', 'spectacular', 'camera', 'work', 'breathtaking', 'hair', 'raising', 'mountain', 'scenery', 'USA', 'famous', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'terrain', 'also', 'Swiss', 'Alps.The', 'Richard', 'Shickel', 'authored', 'biography', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'titled', 'Clint', 'stunt', 'man', 'doubling', 'actor-climbers', 'Swiss', 'Alps', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'shoot', 'entire', 'production', 'was', 'almost', 'shut', 'down', 'result', 'Eiger', 'Sanction', '1975', 'beauty', 'danger', 'monster', 'mountains', 'must', 'be', 'counted', 'best', 'outdoor', 'photography', 'ever', 'provided', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'historically', 'interesting', 'mirrored', 'times', 'middle', '1970', 'were', 'still', 'part', 'counter-cultural', 'revolution', 'sympathies', 'usually', 'called', 'collectively', '60', 'actually', 'period', 'comprising', 'last', 'half', '1960', 'first', 'half', '1970', '1970', 'was', 'also', 'counter-cultural', ""n't"", 'get', 'credit', 'when', 'while', 'era', 'referred', ""'60"", '.Heterosexual', 'interplay', 'enthusiasms', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'various', 'attractive', 'actresses', 'part', 'movie', 'are', 'part', 'show', 'are', 'sort', 'later', 'disappeared', 'movies', 'Sexual', 'Revolution', 'counter-cultural', 'times', 'faded', 'away.The', 'anti-CIA', 'anti-government', 'sympathies', 'mentality', 'counter-cultural', 'times', 'are', 'also', 'seen', 'Eiger', 'Sanction', '1975', 'cynically', 'CIA', 'ordered', 'staged', 'assassinations', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'necessary', 'justified', 'Eiger', 'Sanction', '1975', 'CIA', 'agent', 'movie', 'most', 'others', 'type', 'not', 'have', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'duke', 'out', 'end', 'bad', 'guy', 'main', 'interest', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'photography', '.the', 'movie', 'sort', 'ultimate', 'travelogue', 'spectacular', 'mountains', 'seen', 'vivid', 'color', 'astonishing', 'angles', 'camera', 'work', 'done', 'helicopters', 'small', 'airplanes', 'get', 'close', 'almost', 'surgical', 'way', 'Eiger', 'Sanction', '1975', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'become', 'famous', 'honored', 'movie', 'listed', 'classics', 'time', 'be', 'Jaws', '1975', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'year', '1975', 'Eiger', 'Sanction', '1975', 'was', 'also', 'produced', 'Richard', 'Zanuck', 'David', 'Brown', 'Helen', 'Gurley', 'Brown', 'husband', 'also', 'included', 'music', 'composed', 'composer', 'John', 'Williams', 'Eiger', 'Sanction', '1975', 'included', 'heavyweight', 'support', 'talent', 'result', 'was', 'still', 'true', 'winner.', '-Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG', 'Actor']",The Eiger Sanction

A plot that makes James  Bond seem believable, starting with a combination art expert/mountain  climber/CIA assassin and going forward from there.4.  Fantastic scenery  shots, including George Kennedy and Clint on top of a sandstone pinnacle  (I'm sure George really climbed it...yeah, right).5.  A cool resort  compound (actually filmed at the lodge in Zion National Park, Utah).6.  Well-timed 70s nudity (in other words, totally unnecessary).7.  An  albino (!) &quot;establishment&quot; guy, (CIA leader) and his wonderfully  despicable sidekick, just waiting for Clint to kick around.8.  Astounding political incorrectness, including a character named  &quot;Jemimah Brown&quot;, another one known simply as &quot;Buns&quot;,  and much, much more.9.

62883,A2IY9M330NKBW6,0783230346,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Clint Eastwood is now a Hollywood icon. This movie was earlier in his directing career and, though it shows some deft touches, it lacks a sense of storytelling he would develop to a much greater degree later on.Here's the scoop. Clint plays Dr. Hemlock, an art professor over whom many of his female students swoon. He was a high level hitman for some shadowy government department who is now blackmailing him into ""sanctioning"" (read hit) two foreign agents who just sanctioned one of our own. They know the first target who Clint terminates in rather clumsy fashion early on. They don't know the second target but they know he'll be climbing the Eiger mountain with a team. Clint, having twice previously tried and failed to climb the Eiger, joins the team in hopes of rubbing out the bad guy.This is a good watch but lacks the necessary tension when it's needed. The set up is decent. The second act, when he visits his bud (George Kennedy), who owns a climbing school, where he needs to train and brush up his skills, is pretty good. The third act, where he needs to climb the mountain, identify the second agent, and do him in, is where things lose focus. This turns into a mountain climbing movie. He directed the climbing stuff really well. And it appears Clint, having begun his career as a stunt man, did much of the climbing himself. But there is little tension here. Little sense of the cat and mouse play one should find in this situation. And the final confrontation just doesn't work. I don't want to spoil so I'll need to leave it at that.Some of the character names, Hemlock, Dragon, Pope, are a bit strange. The music, early John Williams, has some nifty, trademark Eastwood, jazz passages. The padder is clever. Some of the story aspects are very good. Except maybe the Miles Mellough part. And Eastwood shows a deft hand in directing under what must have been difficult circumstances. Had the tension been higher in the third act, this would have been a great film.",3,Focus!

But, I am not ashamed, and a really do enjoy this movie.A relatively young, and  satiny-smooth Eastwood is the killer for hire, who avenges the murder of  U.S. government agents.  He also happens to be a world class mountain  climber and an art expert.  Conned into coming out of retirement, he takes  one last job for $100,000 (and the chance to avenge a friend).  Being  Clint, he kills the bad guys, survives himself when none others could, and  of course gets several girls.Great cinematography.  The scene where  Eastwood and George Kennedy scale the unconquerable pinnacle is stunning.  One  cannot always tell in that scene what was &quot;real&quot; and what  was actually a set up.  The final shot of that portion of the movie, when a  camera obviously set in a helicopter moves away from the height and showing  them sitting (and obviously heavily strapped to the top) is stunning.  Watching the final quarter, shot on a mountainside, makes one actually feel  cold.The movie is also incredibly sexist.

So, Clint does Indiana Bond, teaches Art in the college, collects priceless paintings of the Artists no less than El Greco, Pissarro, and such, is an accomplished mountain climber, and on the side moonlights as an assassin for C2, an international spy organization led by an ex-Nazi albino villain known as Mr. Dragon. By the time, the movie starts, Dr. Jonathan Hemlock (Eastwood) is retired from C2 but like so many retired secret agents, just when he thought he was out, they pulled him back in. His former employer, terrifying Mr. Dragon who has to stay all the time in almost complete darkness due to his condition, orders him to perform a ""sanction"" meaning to kill a man who had killed a friend and a former colleague of Hemlock with C2. To complete the mission, Dr. Hemlock has to participate in the attempt to climb one of the most dangerous mountains in Swiss Alps, the North face of Eiger - thus the title of the film, The Eiger Sanction. While preparing for the mission, Hemlock would go to train in Arizona at a mountain resort run by a close friend, Ben Bowman. The Arizona sequence allowed Eastwood the director to make some truly magnificent and stunning shots of Monument Valley. The shoot of Eastwood and George Kennedy on top of the ""Totem Pole"" is a real spectacle and a symbol of masculinity that Eastwood has been the embodiment of. Besides being breathtakingly beautiful, it has historic significance - it was the last time anyone was allowed to climb to ""Totem Pole"".The second half of the film takes place in Alps and covers the preparations of the international group of four famous climbers from France, Germany, Austria, and USA (Dr. Hemlock) for the ascent to Eiger and the dramatic climb. To make the matter even more difficult for Hemlock, one of three mountaineers is the target of The Eiger Sanction, and that's all he knows. The name of his future victim was not revealed to him by his bosses at C2.Even with the laughable dialogs, one-liners, and way over the top villains, The Eiger Sanction is an entertaining movie which has a lot to enjoy. First of all, during his long career, Clint Eastwood has always been a strong presence at the screen. Back in 1975, at the age of 45, he looked great, and the lustful interest in him from the beautiful exotic girls in the best traditions of the Bond's movies is fully justified.

Do you like spy stories, secret international organizations, assigned killings and the like? Well, maybe You'd like this CD. I've somehow gotten tired of this cold-war-related type of thing. In any case, Eastwood comes out of retirement as a college art professor (really?) in order to revenge the killing of an old friend. The movie involves a lot of training )with George Kennedy as the trainer) in mountain climbing in order to confront the perpetrator on a climb of Eiger Peak in Switzerland. Well, mountain climbing involves a lot of suspense in itself, in addition to a murder plot to go along with it, and I've never particularly cared for mountain climbing.In any case, the base camp and practice climbs were at an unidentified locality, which to me was obviously Zion National Park and Monument Valley (both beautiful locals, I might add). It seemed rather strange that they'd leave the base camp (Zion) and go out for a day's climb in Monument Valley, a full day's drive away. Sorry, I'm a geologist and just can't help notice such things. I guess making movies can get somewhat complicated. In any case, the final and most suspenseful scenes are saved for the Swiss Alps. Beautiful, beautiful local. Well, whoever put the story and screenplay together had a bizarre and twisted sense of humor and I'm not going to tell you why. Enjoy the movie.

Many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it's running time (128 minutes), insisting it's too slow.  Almost ALL of Clint's films (the ones he's directed) run long.  The running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours (the longest being Bird, at 2 hours, 40 minutes).  Sure, the film isn't PC, but it was made in 1975, when you didn't have to be PC.  But there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on...the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film.  These are nervewracking and incredibly authentic.  Clint did all his own stunts in these sequences, and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences.  And they are very intense to watch, because you know the actors are really up there.  No CGI in those days.  This is one of the reasons they work so well.  CGI looks fake anyway.  It makes movies seem like cartoons.  People know it isn't real.  CGI reliance should be reduced in Hollywood, as it takes the tension out of action scenes.Check this film out.

Eastwood is blackmailed into an assasination on a mountain called the Eiger, that's as much of the plot as I think you need know, unless you've seen it of course, in which case you know what will happen. If you haven't seen it then you are missing out. The mountain climbing sequences are fantastic, and I think this story suits Eastwoods direcing style perfectly. It is kind of slow and plods along at times, but I like it that way. The story is textured and the conclusion is pleasing. This is classic Clint Eastwood, that's as much as anyone needs to know really. The special features are pretty poor, no documentary of any value, and it would be nice to hear Clint talk us through his film, you get standard early Universal DVD features instead.

His mission is to kill an unknown double agent who deep sixed a close friend of Eastwood.Be prepared for total political incorrectness and rampant sexism reminiscent of the early Bond flicks. It is somewhat jarring to see and hear in these politically correct times. When you see the film, you will know what I mean. Notwithstanding this, it is still an entertaining film.Eastwood's quest for the unknown double agent takes him to the Eiger, where he ultimately makes a life changing decision, as does his friend, played by George Kennedy.

62905,ABE8YHLYSM15G,0783230346,Luke Killion,"[1, 1]","""Eiger Sanction"" directed by Clint Eastwood is one of the best spy/assassin movies of the 1970's, in the same genre as ""Marathon Man"" and ""Three Days of the Condor."" It seems that these flicks were popular during the 70's; in the aftermath of the Nixon adminstration there was definately a heightened state of awareness (perhaps even paranoia) concerning the CIA and its ""questionable"" activities.  Despite Eastwood's Dirty Harry character bending the rules to eradicate the demented Scorpio sniper (who is a cross between Charles Manson and the Zodiac), Eastwood's role as actor/director in this slightly anti-authoritarian story is consistent with the doubt and suspicion many Americans held towards secret intelligence agencies in the post Nixon world.There have been many many spy/CIA movies filmed in the last 40 years; while some are excellent like this one, others are lacking in any believable story line, and contain action scenes that certainly don't represent a take on realism.  What made this movie so good was the strong mix of 70's era Agency type characters (derived from the novel written by the author known as Trevanian), and the incredible stunt work.  The beginning scenes to this movie, which are related to the theme of mountain climbing contain riveting action sequences, some of which are done by Clint himself (most notably the first ""assignment"" or ""sanction"" of a target). It seems he was very inspried by this project and really prepared for the role with realistic training that any ""asset"" would undergo.I'm not sure of the entirety of Clint Eastwood's career, but I know this film was one of his first forays into the director's  chair.  As an actor, he studied under Serio Leone for his trilogy of Westerns, and Don Siegal for his movies containing legal issues, such as the Dirty Harry series.  The cinematography in the mountains of the American southwest and Swiss Alps is ahead of its time; Eastwood really captures the landscapes using aerial shots as well as close up angles of the climbers in the film's climax on Mt. Eiger, where Eastwood is attempting to locate an enemy agent.Besides the great locations and realistic stunt work, the acting was also convincing; any spy movie based on intrigue and suspense must have believable actors who do not give away the reality of their character. Eastwood is John Hemlock, a Cold War era commando turned college professor, who is ""requested"" for another job, even though he has handed in his resignation with ""C2"". The ""Dragon"", the operational cheif is an inventive and slightly creepy albino who is completely unscrupulous but with an amazing gift of prognostication when it comes to predicting human behavior. The cast is rounded out by George Kennedy as Bowman, Hemlock's old buddy who assists with his training and coordinates safety for the climb, as well as Vonetta McGee who plays the seductress Jamima Brown (a slight nod to 70's ""blaxploitation"" films).  I found this movie was among my favorite 70's flicks,in its characters, Cold War spy scenarios and popular style of the decade.",5,Agency thriller with mountain climbing twist,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,3076,"['Sanction', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'one', 'best', 'spy/assassin', 'movies', '1970', 'same', 'genre', 'Marathon', 'Man', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'flicks', 'were', 'popular', '70', 'aftermath', 'Nixon', 'adminstration', 'there', 'was', 'definately', 'heightened', 'state', 'awareness', 'perhaps', 'even', 'paranoia', 'concerning', 'CIA', 'questionable', 'activities', 'Eastwood', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'character', 'bending', 'rules', 'eradicate', 'demented', 'Scorpio', 'sniper', 'who', 'cross', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'Zodiac', 'Eastwood', 'role', 'actor/director', 'slightly', 'anti-authoritarian', 'story', 'consistent', 'doubt', 'suspicion', 'many', 'Americans', 'held', 'towards', 'secret', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'post', 'Nixon', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'many', 'spy/CIA', 'movies', 'filmed', 'last', '40', 'years', 'are', 'excellent', 'one', 'others', 'are', 'lacking', 'believable', 'story', 'line', 'contain', 'action', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'represent', 'take', 'realism', 'What', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'strong', 'mix', '70', 'era', 'Agency', 'type', 'characters', 'derived', 'novel', 'written', 'author', 'known', 'Trevanian', 'incredible', 'stunt', 'work', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'related', 'theme', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'contain', 'riveting', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'done', 'Clint', 'most', 'notably', 'first', 'assignment', 'sanction', 'target', 'was', 'very', 'inspried', 'project', 'really', 'prepared', 'role', 'realistic', 'training', 'asset', 'would', 'undergo.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'entirety', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'career', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'forays', 'director', 'chair', 'actor', 'studied', 'Serio', 'Leone', 'trilogy', 'Westerns', 'Don', 'Siegal', 'movies', 'containing', 'legal', 'issues', 'such', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'series', 'cinematography', 'mountains', 'American', 'southwest', 'Swiss', 'Alps', 'ahead', 'time', 'Eastwood', 'really', 'landscapes', 'using', 'aerial', 'shots', 'as', 'well', 'close', 'angles', 'climbers', 'film', 'climax', 'Mt', 'Eiger', 'where', 'Eastwood', 'attempting', 'locate', 'enemy', 'great', 'locations', 'realistic', 'stunt', 'work', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'convincing', 'spy', 'movie', 'based', 'intrigue', 'suspense', 'must', 'have', 'believable', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'reality', 'character', 'Eastwood', 'John', 'Hemlock', 'Cold', 'War', 'era', 'commando', 'turned', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'requested', 'job', 'even', 'handed', 'resignation', 'C2', 'Dragon', 'operational', 'cheif', 'inventive', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'albino', 'who', 'completely', 'unscrupulous', 'amazing', 'gift', 'prognostication', 'when', 'predicting', 'human', 'behavior', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Bowman', 'Hemlock', 'old', 'buddy', 'who', 'training', 'coordinates', 'safety', 'climb', 'as', 'well', 'Vonetta', 'McGee', 'who', 'seductress', 'Jamima', 'Brown', 'slight', 'nod', '70', 'blaxploitation', 'films', 'found', 'movie', 'was', 'favorite', '70', 'flicks', 'characters', 'Cold', 'War', 'spy', 'scenarios', 'popular', 'style', 'decade']",The Eiger Sanction

62907,A2E9TRM8096BXU,0783230346,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[5, 12]","In his seemingly endless career, Clint Eastwood has directed quite a few movies, and acted in a helluva lot more. ""The Eiger Sanction"" may rank as the wierdest of all of these, and that's saying something. It's the not-so-short story of a semi-retired government assassin who is blackmailed back into service for one last job. Of course, ""one last job"" turns into several. And the last of the last involves a target whose identity is unknown to both Eastwood and his employers. Cross a boilerplate international secret-agent yarn with a whodunnit, or rather a whoisit, mix in some Rocky-esque training sequences and top it off with a documentary on the wierd because-it's-there mountain-climbing culture, and you have ""The Eiger Sanction.""I knew after 5 minutes of watching this movie it had to be based on a novel, and not a particularly good one at that. It has the feeling of a by-the-numbers story punched up to ""colorful"" dimensions by a pill-popping hack writer, who deciced that making every character so wildly eccentric would make us forget they could all have walked right out of Central Casting with their per diem checks in hand.Take the names, for instance: Hemlock, Mello, Dragon, Wormwood, Pope, George (for a woman), and of course, Jemimah. Subtle, they're not.But I'm getting ahead of myself. Eastwood is Dr. Hemlock, the ex-assassin who now works as college professor. For a third of the film, Clint plays Hemlock as a fussy, smug, condescending, know-it-all who uses words like ""involuted"" and wears ridiculous 70's era eyeglasses. Then, about a half-hour into the film, he simply becomes CLINT EASTWOOD, guzzling beer, using words like ""ain't"" and abandoning the professor persona completely. I never did figure out whether this was intentional, meaning that Hemlock's collegiate personality was simply an act, or whether Clint simply couldn't summon the energy to play Hemlock as such an annoying, arse-puckered temple of repression and decided to play himself for the rest of the flick instead. To his credit, once Eastwood drops the smug, his character is a lot more likable and often very funny.Hemlock's boss is Dragon, a wierd albino who lives in a climate-controlled office(I'm not making this up). Dragon, we are told, used to work for the Nazis, and how he heads up C-2, a ""deniable"" gov't agency that ""sanctions"" various unfortunates who fall afoul of it. He blackmails Hemlock out of retirement by threatening problems with the IRS over Hemlock's art collection (I SWEAR I am not making this up). Then he sweetens the pot by saying that the mystery target is the guy that iced Hemlock's friend and mentor. Dragon also employs a hapless minion named Pope, whose main purpose in the film seems to be to get beaten up and humiliated by Eastwood. Question: if you're such a Professor Moriartyesque mastermind, why can't you employ a goon who actually knows how to fight?Hemlock's girlfriend, sort of, is a black female agent named....sigh....Jemimah. She seduces him and steals his money, which is how all good relationships start. Then he gives her a condescending lecture on the immortality of her actions, which had me holding my head in dismay. Dude, YOU KILL PEOPLE FOR A LIVING, AND YOU'RE GIVING MORALITY LESSONS? NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL INVOLUTED.After killing several unimportant people, Hemlock discovers that his mystery target is a mountain-climber going up with an expedition to best the Eiger, a man-eating pile o'rock in the Swiss Alps. Since Hemlock twice failed to conquer the Eiger, he's naturally intrigued. He can combine his two hobbies and take a vacation to Europe all at once. But first he has to get in shape, and since this takes half the movie, it's worth noting.Eastwood's old friend George Kennedy trains him at his remote desert resort in Arizona. While Hemlock follows George, his female Indian mountain guide, around on endless runs up sheer rock, he runs into Mello, an effete, foppish ex-mercenary now emeshed in the drug trade, who left Hemlock for dead in the jungle years ago. Poor Mello, played by Jack Cassidy, is one of those unfortunate characters who always appear in Eastwood films, whose express purpose is to be humiliated over and over again and then get killed. Like Dragon, Mello employs a bodyguard who can't fight and ends up blubbering for his life in the middle of the desert. The scene is played for laughs, but I didn't find it funny, or realistic. Hemlock drives the guy at gunpoint into the Mojave desert and leaves him to die of thirst and heat stroke? You gotta be kidding. First of all, if Mello really was an ex-special forces drug kingpin, he'd hardly be the floppy-wristed wuss Cassidy is forced to portray. Second, he'd be carrying a damn gun himself, instead of a poodle and a pack of cigarettes. I've met a lot of SF guys in my life, and none of 'em ever lisped, ""You let ME choose the wine!""Having prepped himself, Eastwood heads for the Eiger while trying to puzzle out which of his team-mates he's got to kill. He also beats up Pope again, for using an unpleasant phrase to describe Jemimah. Once again, let us behold the hypocrisy: the murderer for hire stands up for racial justice. Finally, and by this time you've worn quite a groove in your couch and are probably on like your ninth beer, they climb the mountain, and the real fun begins. Will Eastwood get his man? Will Eastwood even survive the climb? Do you care, considering he's playing a sadistic button-man with a superiority complex?The answer is, yeah, sort of. This movie is bizarre, sluggish, wantonly cruel, and has enough shots of the Arizona desert and the Swiss alps to fill 2 or 3 documentaries. But it's also wierdly compelling and visually impressive. When he isn't humiliating people or killing them, Eastwood's Hemlock is wisecracking at thrice the rate of Dirty Harry. All that's missing is the enjoyabl sensation that the hero is actually doing something good.",3,Wierd. Sadistic. Entertaining.

If it weren't for the mountain climbing scenes, this movie is rather lifeless and dull.  Clint plays a college art professor (duh?) who was once a top notch assassin, and he is blackmailed into doing two sanctions for the albino head of some covert agency (played by the late Thayer David, who I will remember from his roles on TV's Dark Shadows).  His sanction is the Eiger Sanction, his job to kill one assassin who got away; the problem is he doesn't know who the assassin is.  Along for the ride are Vonetta McGee, hopelessly miscast as Eastwood's lover and a fellow agent; Jack Cassidy, hamming up his role as a homosexual ex-partner of Eastwood's; George Kennedy, fresh from his Cool Hand Luke Oscar as Eastwood's good buddy mountain climber; and Gregory Walcott as the obnoxious henchman of David's, who also likes to chew up his scenery.  After a fairly suspenseful opening in which an agent is killed for secret microfilm, the movie plods along until its climax.  I don't know why Eastwood chose to spend so much time showing us the Arizona landscape and his ""working out to get in shape"" for the climb scenes.  They're drawn out and impede suspense possibilities.  The movie is okay for a 1970's flick, but it pales in comparison to most of Clint's later work.",3,MOUNTAIN CLIMBING FOR DUMMIES,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,1410,"['EIGER', 'SANCTION', 'definitely', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'foreshadowed', 'great', 'films', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'achieve', 'later', 'career', 'were', ""n't"", 'mountain', 'climbing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'rather', 'lifeless', 'dull', 'Clint', 'college', 'art', 'professor', 'duh', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'top', 'notch', 'assassin', 'blackmailed', 'doing', 'two', 'sanctions', 'albino', 'head', 'covert', 'agency', 'played', 'late', 'Thayer', 'David', 'who', 'will', 'remember', 'roles', 'TV', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'sanction', 'Eiger', 'Sanction', 'job', 'kill', 'one', 'assassin', 'who', 'got', 'away', 'problem', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'assassin', 'ride', 'are', 'Vonetta', 'McGee', 'hopelessly', 'miscast', 'Eastwood', 'lover', 'fellow', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'hamming', 'up', 'role', 'homosexual', 'ex-partner', 'Eastwood', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'fresh', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'Oscar', 'Eastwood', 'good', 'buddy', 'mountain', 'climber', 'Gregory', 'Walcott', 'obnoxious', 'henchman', 'David', 'who', 'also', 'chew', 'up', 'scenery', 'fairly', 'suspenseful', 'opening', 'agent', 'killed', 'secret', 'microfilm', 'movie', 'plods', 'along', 'climax', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Eastwood', 'chose', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'showing', 'Arizona', 'landscape', 'working', 'out', 'get', 'shape', 'climb', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'drawn', 'out', 'impede', 'suspense', 'possibilities', 'movie', 'okay', '1970', 'flick', 'comparison', 'most', 'Clint', 'later', 'work']",The Eiger Sanction

He is a retired assassin for a government agency, who is persuaded out of his art loving retirement for one last job.  He, apparently, is also a retired rock climber, and therefore the only man for the job since his mark is one of a group of climbers about to climb the Eiger... but which climber is it..? We don't know.  Well, in truth the whodunit is fairly easy to see early on, and the first hour is pretty mediocre 70's fayre.. It's once the climbing starts the tension starts racking up, thanks to Clint's insistence on both acting and directing on location and doing the stunts for real.  Sadly, this was to lead to the death of one of the stuntmen climbers, who ironically had previously successfully climbed the Eiger.Nobody really seems to be taking this seriously, least of all Clint as either actor or director, as the `plot' develops with many a 70's clich&eacute;.. girls with afros jumping into bed at the drop of a hat, random nudity, horribly stereotyped camp gay bad guy (who actually names his dog `faggot' in case you don't get the `subtle' clues) and George Kennedy, just to name a few. Eastwood forgets the slack first half once we get to the Eiger in the final section of the movie, and it's the tense climbing scenes rather than any intrigue or 70's styling you will probably remember after the lights come up.  Also worth a note is a John Williams score which more than passes muster in setting the scene for that real 70's thriller feel...Truthfully, Eastwood's indefatigable screen charisma makes this a 4 star movie, despite trying to convincingly play a `womanising-art-lecturer-retired-assassin-rock-climber `, which isn't a part one imagines one is asked to do very often..  However the very poor transfer - which is so bad in places you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching a pirated copy - knocks a star off.  It's in widescreen at least, but non anamorphic (meaning it's not designed for modern widescreen TV's and will appear as a letterbox in the middle of the screen, requiring some zooming in to fill out your screen), frequently washed out colours despite the gorgeous locales, and full of other imperfections.

62923,A1W9LIU8OMPGYZ,0783230346,"Stefan T. Wennik ""stw""","[16, 18]","As a thriller, the 'Eiger Sanction' is just ok. It is a pretty faithful adaptation of Trevanian's bestseller from 1972. It stars Clint Eastwood as Dr. Johnathan Hemlock -- an ex-climber now art professor who does occasional asassinations for a secret US agency to pay for his art collection. He takes on one last job to pay for a Pissaro he desperately wants; but it requires that he get out his old climbing boots. He'll have to do the job while climbing the north face of the Eiger -- certainly one of the most dangerous climbs in the world.I'm not completely sure of this, but I believe that this movie was also Clint Eastwood's directorial debut. He not only stars in it, but he produced and directed it as well!Ah, the glorious 70's! The clothing, the hairstyles, the attitudes towards women, etc. It is quite fun to watch and chuckle at now. Hemlock is a kind of James Bond-ian super hero.  Remarkably gifted not only at killing bad guys but also at bedding beautiful women, enjoying fine wine and food, and being an art expert. The story ofen requires you to suspend your sense of reality and to have a bit of a sense of humor. If you enjoy these kinds of thrillers, you'll definitely enjoy this one.What sets this movie apart for me is the many climbing sequences! I am an avid climber and I know of no other 'Hollywood' movie that does as good a job as this one at showing real mountain climbing. The climbing scenes in the 'Eiger Sanction' are breathtaking and quite realistic. The scenes on the Eiger were actually filmed on location on the Eiger Nordwand itself! Remarkable! Apparently Clint is/was a bit of a climber himself, and took great pains to portray the climbing in as realistic a light as possible. Three cheers for Clint! On a sad note, one of the stuntmen/riggers was killed while filming the scenes on the Eiger.Most other mass-market climbing films completely ruin the climbing scenes to make them more dramatic or exciting (Vertical Limit, Cliffhanger, K2, etc.); or are documentaries trying to cash in on the current Everest fever (and are more interested in the 'death zone' aspect of high altitude climbing than actually showing real climbing).Bottom line for me: I bought this VHS for its depiction of the climbing more than the story line.

Unfortunately, by the end of this plodding film you may be hoping for the ropes to break. Trevanian's novel was a James Bond spoof pulled off with such ingenuity, and with so many genuinely exciting touches, that many readers and critics missed the joke entirely. (This despite characters with names like Jean-Paul Bidet, Felicity Arce, Randy Knickers and -- my favorite -- Yurasis Dragon.) This adaptation loses the author's wit and sarcasm, leaving the impression that nobody involved in the production actually understood the material. I'd guess that Trevanian hated this film, judging from the scalding references to Eastwood's films in the nove Shibumi.",2,"Thin air, thinner film",1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,809,"['second', 'star', 'spectacular', 'Alpine', 'photography', 'stunt', 'work', 'director/star', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'evidently', 'doing', 'lot', 'own', 'climbing', 'Unfortunately', 'end', 'plodding', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'hoping', 'ropes', 'break', 'Trevanian', 'novel', 'was', 'James', 'Bond', 'spoof', 'pulled', 'off', 'such', 'ingenuity', 'so', 'many', 'genuinely', 'exciting', 'touches', 'many', 'readers', 'critics', 'missed', 'joke', 'entirely', 'characters', 'names', 'Jean-Paul', 'Bidet', 'Felicity', 'Arce', 'Randy', 'Knickers', 'favorite', 'Yurasis', 'Dragon', 'adaptation', 'author', 'wit', 'sarcasm', 'leaving', 'impression', 'nobody', 'involved', 'production', 'actually', 'understood', 'material', ""'d"", 'guess', 'Trevanian', 'hated', 'film', 'judging', 'scalding', 'references', 'Eastwood', 'films', 'nove', 'Shibumi']",The Eiger Sanction
62925,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0783230346,trebe,"[5, 6]","""The Eiger Sanction"" stars Clint Eastwood as Jonathan Hemlock, a college professor of art, experienced mountain climber and ex-hit man for ""C-2"", an agency of the US Government.  C-2 is headed by an albino named ""Dragon"", who wants two enemy agents ""sanctioned"" (killed).  Hemlock agrees to perform the hit, going to Zurich to do the job.  The execution is very messy, hardly what one would call ""professional"", but the job gets done.  Dragon still wants the second agent eliminated, but C-2 is having trouble pinpointing the identity of the target.  What is known is that the man will be part of an upcoming international climb of the Eiger, a mountain in the Swiss Alps.Hemlock needs to get in shape for the climb.  His training takes place out west, at a climbing school run by Ben Bowman (George Kennedy) an old climbing buddy.  Hemlock's training is complicated when Miles Mellough (Jack Cassidy) arrives on the scene.  Mellough betrayed Hemlock years before, nearly costing him his life.  This time Miles takes a trip he won't return from.Trained and ready, Hemlock arrives in Switzerland with Bowman, prepared for the climb, and his mission.  The team includes three other climbers, one of whom is supposedly the target to be ""sanctioned"".  One climber must continually ask silly questions any experienced climber would know the answers to, so the audience can become informed about the common practices of mountain climbing.  Once the climb begins, we are treated to some magnificent scenes in the mountains.  To my untrained eyes the scenes look very realistic, and are the best the movie has to offer, as they transition from climbing bare rock to snow covered rock faces.  While they climb, Hemlock attempts to zero in on his target, and find the one he has to kill.  The mountain does his work for him, as the Eiger proves to be too much for the team.  Accidents and bad weather add up to disaster for all but Hemlock.  C-2 is satisfied that the mission has been accomplished, but they don't know the complete truth.While The Eiger Sanction is not a great movie, Clint Eastwood makes an excellent Hemlock, and the scenes of mountain climbing, both in America and Switzerland do make the movie worth viewing.  Eastwood should also be applauded for his efforts to bring realism to his role when it came to doing his own stunt work.  He also directed this feature, which is another of the challenging films he did in the 70's.",3,Adventurous Eastwood...,1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,2435,"['Eiger', 'Sanction', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Jonathan', 'Hemlock', 'college', 'professor', 'art', 'experienced', 'mountain', 'climber', 'ex-hit', 'man', 'C-2', 'agency', 'US', 'Government', 'C-2', 'headed', 'albino', 'named', 'Dragon', 'who', 'two', 'enemy', 'agents', 'sanctioned', 'killed', 'Hemlock', 'perform', 'hit', 'going', 'Zurich', 'do', 'job', 'execution', 'very', 'messy', 'hardly', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'professional', 'job', 'done', 'Dragon', 'still', 'second', 'agent', 'eliminated', 'C-2', 'having', 'trouble', 'pinpointing', 'identity', 'target', 'What', 'known', 'man', 'will', 'be', 'part', 'upcoming', 'international', 'climb', 'Eiger', 'mountain', 'Swiss', 'Alps.Hemlock', 'needs', 'get', 'shape', 'climb', 'training', 'place', 'out', 'west', 'climbing', 'school', 'run', 'Ben', 'Bowman', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'old', 'climbing', 'buddy', 'Hemlock', 'training', 'complicated', 'when', 'Miles', 'Mellough', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'scene', 'Mellough', 'betrayed', 'Hemlock', 'years', 'before', 'nearly', 'costing', 'life', 'time', 'Miles', 'trip', 'wo', ""n't"", 'return', 'from.Trained', 'ready', 'Hemlock', 'Switzerland', 'Bowman', 'prepared', 'climb', 'mission', 'team', 'three', 'other', 'climbers', 'one', 'whom', 'supposedly', 'target', 'be', 'sanctioned', 'One', 'climber', 'must', 'continually', 'ask', 'silly', 'questions', 'experienced', 'climber', 'would', 'know', 'answers', 'audience', 'can', 'become', 'informed', 'common', 'practices', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'climb', 'are', 'treated', 'magnificent', 'scenes', 'mountains', 'untrained', 'eyes', 'scenes', 'look', 'very', 'realistic', 'are', 'best', 'movie', 'offer', 'transition', 'climbing', 'bare', 'rock', 'snow', 'covered', 'rock', 'climb', 'Hemlock', 'zero', 'target', 'find', 'one', 'kill', 'mountain', 'work', 'Eiger', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'team', 'Accidents', 'bad', 'weather', 'add', 'disaster', 'Hemlock', 'C-2', 'satisfied', 'mission', 'been', 'accomplished', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'complete', 'Eiger', 'Sanction', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'excellent', 'Hemlock', 'scenes', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'America', 'Switzerland', 'do', 'make', 'movie', 'viewing', 'Eastwood', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'applauded', 'efforts', 'bring', 'realism', 'role', 'when', 'came', 'doing', 'own', 'stunt', 'work', 'also', 'directed', 'feature', 'challenging', 'films', 'did', '70']",The Eiger Sanction
62926,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0783230346,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","The Eiger Sanction is one of those films with a high enough concept and a big enough star not to need to have a good script, which is lucky because despite the efforts of no fewer than three writers the script is not very good at all, and seems to know it. Clint Eastwood is a somewhat unlikely mountain-climbing art professor: we know this because he's introduced standing next to a big sign saying he's an art professor while enamoured students swoon over pictures of him mountain climbing. Luckily for the film he's a somewhat more likely retired assassin working for Thayer David's total albino: we know he's a total albino because he tells us. David and Eastwood don't get on, which is strange, because David's office is perpetually in the kind of near total darkness that Eastwood the director loves. Maybe he just doesn't like people who impersonate Bond villains. He doesn't want to go back in business either, but David threatens him not only with an audit of his stolen art collection but also to auction them off to the public, something which horrifies art snob Eastwood into agreeing to kill an unknown man with an occasional limp who just happens to be part of a team led by old pal George Kennedy attempting to climb the Eiger. Only his target obviously knows that one of the party is out to kill him and his fellow climbers start to meet accidents...Yes, it's a very silly film - silly enough for Eastwood to camp it up as a gay delivery man in one scene, Jack Cassidy to play a gay turncoat with a horny dog called Faggit with a thing for Clint's leg and for our antihero to beat up one of the stars of Plan 9 From Outer Space - but as the author of the novel, Travanian (Rod Whitaker) pointed out, worse than just being vapid it also led to the death of one of the climbers involved in the shoot, David Knowles. His accidental death early in shooting on the Eiger itself does unfortunately take some of the sheen off the film's most impressive aspect, the unfaked climbing sequences with Eastwood not only doing almost all of his own stunts on the North Face of the Eiger itself and on the 'Totem Pole Rock' in Monument Valley rather than on a friendlier slope or on studio sets with dodgy back-projection but also directing the film as well. And spare a thought for the poor camera crew, having to take the same risks with the added burden of lugging up and operating camera equipment as well. The film improves considerably as it goes along, though the first half is more of a politically incorrect guilty pleasure, but the spectacular mountain sequences are gripping enough to be worthy of a better film.Unfortunately the DVD, one of the earliest releases on the format, is pretty low quality: the dark scenes are darker than even Eastwood intended there's a lack of detail and a lot of clumsy edge enhancement: it's such a poor transfer with so little effort put into it you half expect it to be panned-and-scanned fullframe, but it is 2.35:1 widescreen with the original trailer as extra, which is something at least.",3,"Terrible script, silly first half but stunning mountaineering sequences",1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,3040,"['Eiger', 'Sanction', 'one', 'films', 'high', 'enough', 'concept', 'big', 'enough', 'star', 'not', 'need', 'have', 'good', 'script', 'lucky', 'efforts', 'fewer', 'three', 'writers', 'script', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'know', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'somewhat', 'unlikely', 'mountain-climbing', 'art', 'professor', 'know', 'introduced', 'standing', 'next', 'big', 'sign', 'saying', 'art', 'professor', 'enamoured', 'students', 'swoon', 'pictures', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'Luckily', 'film', 'somewhat', 'more', 'likely', 'retired', 'assassin', 'working', 'Thayer', 'David', 'total', 'albino', 'know', 'total', 'albino', 'David', 'Eastwood', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'strange', 'David', 'office', 'perpetually', 'kind', 'near', 'total', 'darkness', 'Eastwood', 'director', 'Maybe', 'just', ""n't"", 'like', 'people', 'who', 'impersonate', 'Bond', 'villains', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'back', 'business', 'David', 'not', 'only', 'audit', 'stolen', 'art', 'collection', 'also', 'auction', 'off', 'public', 'something', 'art', 'snob', 'Eastwood', 'agreeing', 'kill', 'unknown', 'man', 'occasional', 'limp', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'part', 'team', 'led', 'old', 'pal', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'attempting', 'climb', 'Eiger', 'Only', 'target', 'obviously', 'one', 'party', 'out', 'kill', 'fellow', 'climbers', 'start', 'meet', 'accidents', 'Yes', 'very', 'silly', 'film', 'silly', 'enough', 'Eastwood', 'camp', 'up', 'gay', 'delivery', 'man', 'one', 'scene', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'play', 'gay', 'turncoat', 'horny', 'dog', 'called', 'Faggit', 'thing', 'Clint', 'leg', 'antihero', 'beat', 'up', 'one', 'stars', 'Plan', '9', 'Outer', 'Space', 'author', 'novel', 'Travanian', 'Rod', 'Whitaker', 'pointed', 'out', 'worse', 'just', 'being', 'vapid', 'also', 'led', 'death', 'one', 'climbers', 'involved', 'shoot', 'David', 'Knowles', 'accidental', 'death', 'early', 'shooting', 'Eiger', 'unfortunately', 'take', 'sheen', 'film', 'most', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'unfaked', 'climbing', 'sequences', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'only', 'doing', 'almost', 'own', 'stunts', 'North', 'Face', 'Eiger', ""'Totem"", 'Pole', 'Rock', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'rather', 'friendlier', 'slope', 'studio', 'sets', 'dodgy', 'back-projection', 'also', 'directing', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'spare', 'thought', 'poor', 'camera', 'crew', 'having', 'take', 'same', 'risks', 'added', 'burden', 'lugging', 'up', 'operating', 'camera', 'equipment', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'considerably', 'along', 'first', 'half', 'more', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'spectacular', 'mountain', 'sequences', 'are', 'gripping', 'enough', 'be', 'worthy', 'better', 'film.Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'one', 'earliest', 'releases', 'format', 'pretty', 'low', 'quality', 'dark', 'scenes', 'are', 'darker', 'even', 'Eastwood', 'intended', 'lack', 'detail', 'lot', 'clumsy', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'such', 'poor', 'transfer', 'so', 'little', 'effort', 'put', 'half', 'expect', 'be', 'panned-and-scanned', 'fullframe', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'original', 'trailer', 'extra', 'something', 'least']",The Eiger Sanction
