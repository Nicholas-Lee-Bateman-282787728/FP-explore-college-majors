The lead female character might as well be a door mat, she is about as dense, bland, and boring as they get. All she does during the entire series is look pretty and demonstrate a staggering lack of common sense (and she is spineless, to make matters worse). As if that isn't bad enough, the acting from all the actors is absolutely terrible. Why and how the lead male character was cast make no sense: He had absolutely no ability delivering emotions (his primary role because he pretty much had no lines of any worth).Daniel Henney fans: I personally could (and would) watch Henney read a phone book for hours, so I recommend this drama if you are a Henney fan. He looks absolutely gorgeous (flawlessly gorgeous) in every single shot, and because his is the sanest character in the series, you will get your money's worth.",1,Worth it ONLY if you are a Henny Fan,1193788800,"10 31, 2007",2007,1068,"['watched', 'series', 'watching', 'lovely', 'Sam-Soon', 'Tutor', 'Friend', 'Sassy', 'Girl', 'three', 'have', 'fantastic', 'female', 'characters', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'still', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'throttle', 'Spring', 'Waltz', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'door', 'mat', 'about', 'dense', 'bland', 'boring', 'get', 'entire', 'series', 'look', 'pretty', 'demonstrate', 'staggering', 'lack', 'common', 'sense', 'spineless', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'acting', 'actors', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'Why', 'how', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'was', 'cast', 'make', 'sense', 'had', 'absolutely', 'ability', 'delivering', 'emotions', 'primary', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'lines', 'worth', 'Henney', 'fans', 'personally', 'could', 'would', 'watch', 'Henney', 'read', 'phone', 'book', 'hours', 'recommend', 'drama', 'are', 'Henney', 'fan', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'flawlessly', 'gorgeous', 'single', 'shot', 'sanest', 'character', 'series', 'will', 'get', 'money', 'worth']",N/A

1057886,A3TP0MYN5MZIKE,B000NO21DC,"Luman Grover Ferrell, Jr.","[1, 1]","I have been a fan of Korean dramas for some time now, having been introduced to them by one of my family members.  &#34;Spring Waltz&#34; and &#34;My Girl&#34; are my all time favorites.  This particular drama had a very engaging plot, storyline, and excellent character development.  All of the actors are very good at their craft.  I would highly recommend this drama to anyone who also likes Korean dramas or appreciates excellent video productions. The subtitles were quite adequate,  and after awhile you would become so engaged in the drama that you would forget that you don't actually understand the Korean language yourself.  I have noticed though that I am picking up many words and phrases from the Korean language.  Hopefully, I want to eventually enroll in some classes in the Korean language so that I can become somewhat fluent in the language myself.The producer of this drama produced three other dramas which also have something to do with one of the other three seasons.  &#34;Winter Sonata&#34; is another excellent drama in the series and if you enjoyed &#34;Spring Waltz&#34; you will probably enjoy &#34;Winter Sonata&#34;.",5,Excellent Korean Drama.

1057887,AOHQAJRWKEDY6,B000NO21DC,"Ukegirl ""Jill, OldTime Film Fan""","[1, 1]","Spring Waltz (2006) is so beautiful that it takes your breath away and melts your heart. The acting of this Korean ensemble is exemplary in every way, especially So Do Young, who plays a tormented male character so filled with personal demons resulting from his tortured childhood, when his alcoholic father abandoned him, demons which he yearns to heal from so desperately, that your heart aches for him. His large puppy dog eyes contain a lifetime of pain. The little girl he loved in childhood he thinks died of a heart ailment, however the adults who adopted him lied to him, and she shows up years later when they are both young adults and they don't recognize each other, but are somehow still attracted to one another mightily; even though others care about them they really have eyes for no one but each other.Miss Han portrays a sweet and innocent girl who has her own demons to deal with, but she copes with them with far better grace and humility than the boy. I love this elfin actress so much. Her face can change emotions ten times in one minute.The soundtrack is MAGNIFICENT on this drama, the last of the &#34;Four Seasons&#34; Korean drama classics, which started with Autumn In My Heart (2000), then Winter Sonata (2002), then Summer Scent (2003) and finally Spring Waltz (2006). All are worthwhile to view and very emotional. Beware of bootleg versions floating out there for these gems, however. Try to get Region One NTSC from YA Entertainment box set original releases. Subtitles are excellent on all YA Entertainment discs, don't be fooled by other reviews where people bought bootlegs and are complaining about bad subs.

1057888,A1M585V9OXGTP8,B000NO21DC,Van,"[2, 4]","At the beginning I had a lot of hope for this series.  This Korean drama offers many beautiful natural scenery from many different locations.  Aside from the excellent cinematography, this love story was a disappointment, in my opinion.  The story is built on the premise that the love between the leading characters is already pre-destined.  When the supporting characters try to show their feelings both leading characters always reject their offers, no matter how kind and genuine they seem.  I find this notion hard to believe.  Both leading characters seem to go through life, hopeless and mean spirited.  There were too much sadness and too much obstacles from beginning to end.  As a viewer it was horrible to endure with these characters.  I was hoping that the leading lady would create a new future for herself but she seem to be trapped in her past and future.  The leading lady was weak and lacks courage to create a better life for herself.  The movie did not inspire me; it just pull me down with its long and pathetic story.  If you want a better romantic Korean drama try watching Tamra Island.  It has a better executed story and a lot more fun to watch.",1,Dissapointing Korean Drama,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,1171,"['beginning', 'had', 'lot', 'hope', 'series', 'Korean', 'drama', 'many', 'beautiful', 'natural', 'scenery', 'many', 'different', 'locations', 'Aside', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'disappointment', 'opinion', 'story', 'built', 'premise', 'love', 'leading', 'characters', 'already', 'pre-destined', 'When', 'supporting', 'characters', 'try', 'show', 'feelings', 'leading', 'characters', 'always', 'reject', 'offers', 'matter', 'how', 'kind', 'genuine', 'seem', 'find', 'notion', 'hard', 'believe', 'leading', 'characters', 'seem', 'go', 'life', 'hopeless', 'mean', 'spirited', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'sadness', 'too', 'much', 'obstacles', 'beginning', 'end', 'viewer', 'was', 'horrible', 'endure', 'characters', 'was', 'hoping', 'leading', 'lady', 'would', 'create', 'new', 'future', 'herself', 'seem', 'be', 'trapped', 'past', 'future', 'leading', 'lady', 'was', 'weak', 'courage', 'create', 'better', 'life', 'herself', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'inspire', 'just', 'pull', 'down', 'long', 'pathetic', 'story', 'want', 'better', 'romantic', 'Korean', 'drama', 'try', 'watching', 'Tamra', 'Island', 'better', 'executed', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A
