380587,A2FQPAN4M6VDUH,630358490X,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","This is an amazing film on several fronts. First, it gives a bleak, but accurate view of modern life for the native Maori people of New Zealand. Next, it explores the desperate life of a low income, abusive family who could exist in any country. For an American it is a cultural awakening to the oppressed life of the aboriginal culture of New Zealand and what it has been reduced to in modern times. There are powerful scenes of a population striving to maintain some grip on its ancient traditions, contrasted with modern ""ghetto life."" It should ring very clear as being similar to our own native Americans and their plight in our own country. Along with this the film brings a vivid portrait of a family struggling with less than easy socio-economical situations and the typical downfalls it presents- alcoholism, drug use and domestic violence.  The climax presents a heart-wrenching scene I can only compare with the rape scene from The Accused. It is burned in my mind, and will forever haunt me in the same way the pinball machine scene from The Accused did.Again, this film has so much to offer on so many levels: powerful performances (many from ""non-actors""), a new cultural awareness, and a bleak portrait of the lives of a poverty-ridden society attempting to cling to some aspect of it history.

Gritty, scary but thoroughly believable.The film is set in the tough suburbs of south Auckland amidst a sea of social dysfunction.  Yet in this sea, there are some individuals who shine however briefly.  There are others who simply flounder.There are magnificent performances by Rena Owen who plays the role of Beth Heke and Temeura Morrison who plays her brutal husband Jake ""the Muss"" Heke.  These two actors are great!  See the film if only to see the characters that they have created.When seeing this film, do not expect to be uplifted.  It is bleak and often terrifying.

380589,A3TXO9NUIJ4G0X,630358490X,Angela,"[0, 0]","Once Were Warriors was sold to us repeatedly by Kiwis and non-Kiwis alike as being the Ultimate Kiwi Film. We were skeptical, as we were pretty sure that the absolutely brilliantThe Piano(starring Sam Neill, music by Michael Nyman, for crying out loud) is the end-all, be-all Kiwi film. How, we thought, could anything possibly top that? Then of course there are those who sayWhale Rideris great, and you have the the rabidly insaneThe Lord of the Ringsfanbase to contend with. Could Once Were Warriors really compete? And could it top them all?Well, the answer is: yes, it competes. We still consider The Piano a better-made film, and we enjoyed it more, but Once Were Warriors is an important film, with a stark, heartbreaking look at a little-known demographic: the modern M'aori community. Indeed, it is because of its content that Once Were Warriors is so good.Essentially a typical Dickensian tale of poor families with evil fathers, it takes place in and around the run-down home of the Heke family. Father Jake (Temuera Morrison, i.e. Jango Fett) is a violent, sexual, hard-drinking man who's recently been laid off. He holds wife, Beth (Rena Owen), in a high-intensity love/hate affair filled with extreme swings of abuse and seduction. Meanwhile, their five children are struggling to keep it all together, each in their own way. Eldest son Nig (Julian Arahanga) has recently joined a Maori gang, while second son Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) is arrested for a petty crime and put into a boy's home. Daughter Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell) is the family's peacemaker and solid core: she cares deeply for her siblings and goes to great lengths to protect them, especially in the moments when their mother can't.The film is brutal and brief (only 99 minutes), and it's also very straightforward. Much of the dialogue, family dynamics and plot points are well-worn clich&eacute;s in the genre of the Hardcore Troubled Working Class Home Life Film. Indeed, so inured are we to these staples that our emotional reactions were often quite muted - more muted than they should have been, given how awful some of the scenes were. (And, importantly, even if it's a clich&eacute; in film, that doesn't mean it doesn't happen in real life.) The filmmaking style was also blunt, even at times sledgehammery: a quick cut from Jake beating Beth to a snarling dog hunting through scraps, a mother's tormented wail fading into the shriek of a passing ambulance's siren. This is a far cry from, for example,A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, which takes an equally tired tale - except this time set in the Bronx - and, through nuance and post-modern presentation, makes it fresh and new. Once Were Warriors' freshness lies almost entirely in the uniqueness of the context (as we said): the modern Maori community in New Zealand.Indeed, the links back to M'aori culture and community had the strongest effect on us: the electrifying scenes of Boogie learning to do the haka, Beth's nostalgic memories of life in the traditional community, the scenes where Nig joins the gang and emerges with his new facial tattoos. These moments were beautiful and very affecting.On the one hand, the film could be about any family anywhere suffering from alcoholism, poverty and domestic abuse - taken that way, the film fails to make much of an impact, with poor writing and shaky acting. But on the other hand, the film is an incisive look into how modernization, colonization and globalization affect traditional cultural practices: in particular, what it means to be M'aori in the 21st century. Taken that way, the film is a powerful and heartbreaking portrayal. Given also that Pacific island cultures are terribly underrepresented in modern filmmaking, Once Were Warriors is that much more significant.*Review originally published at the Post-Punk Cinema Club.",4,"Blunt, tired tale given new life in NZ setting",1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,3838,"['Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'was', 'sold', 'repeatedly', 'Kiwis', 'non-Kiwis', 'alike', 'being', 'Ultimate', 'Kiwi', 'Film', 'were', 'skeptical', 'were', 'pretty', 'sure', 'absolutely', 'brilliantThe', 'Piano', 'starring', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'music', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'end-all', 'be-all', 'Kiwi', 'film', 'How', 'thought', 'could', 'anything', 'possibly', 'top', 'Then', 'course', 'are', 'who', 'sayWhale', 'Rideris', 'great', 'have', 'rabidly', 'insaneThe', 'Lord', 'Ringsfanbase', 'contend', 'Could', 'Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'really', 'compete', 'could', 'top', 'Well', 'answer', 'yes', 'still', 'consider', 'Piano', 'better-made', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'important', 'film', 'stark', 'heartbreaking', 'look', 'little-known', 'demographic', 'modern', ""M'aori"", 'community', 'Indeed', 'content', 'Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'so', 'good.Essentially', 'typical', 'Dickensian', 'tale', 'poor', 'families', 'evil', 'fathers', 'place', 'run-down', 'home', 'Heke', 'family', 'Father', 'Jake', 'Temuera', 'Morrison', 'i.e', 'Jango', 'Fett', 'violent', 'sexual', 'hard-drinking', 'man', 'who', 'recently', 'been', 'laid', 'off', 'wife', 'Beth', 'Rena', 'Owen', 'high-intensity', 'love/hate', 'affair', 'filled', 'extreme', 'swings', 'abuse', 'seduction', 'Meanwhile', 'five', 'children', 'are', 'struggling', 'keep', 'together', 'own', 'way', 'Eldest', 'son', 'Nig', 'Julian', 'Arahanga', 'recently', 'joined', 'Maori', 'gang', 'second', 'son', 'Boogie', 'Taungaroa', 'Emile', 'arrested', 'petty', 'crime', 'put', 'boy', 'home', 'Daughter', 'Grace', 'Mamaengaroa', 'Kerr-Bell', 'family', 'peacemaker', 'solid', 'core', 'deeply', 'siblings', 'great', 'lengths', 'protect', 'especially', 'moments', 'when', 'mother', ""can't.The"", 'film', 'brutal', 'brief', 'only', '99', 'minutes', 'also', 'very', 'straightforward', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'family', 'dynamics', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'well-worn', 'clich', 'eacute', 'genre', 'Hardcore', 'Troubled', 'Working', 'Class', 'Home', 'Life', 'Film', 'Indeed', 'so', 'inured', 'are', 'staples', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'were', 'often', 'quite', 'muted', 'more', 'muted', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'how', 'awful', 'scenes', 'were', 'importantly', 'even', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'was', 'also', 'blunt', 'even', 'times', 'sledgehammery', 'quick', 'cut', 'Jake', 'beating', 'Beth', 'snarling', 'dog', 'hunting', 'scraps', 'mother', 'tormented', 'wail', 'fading', 'shriek', 'passing', 'ambulance', 'siren', 'far', 'cry', 'example', 'A', 'Guide', 'Recognizing', 'Saints', 'equally', 'tired', 'tale', 'time', 'set', 'Bronx', 'nuance', 'post-modern', 'presentation', 'fresh', 'new', 'Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'freshness', 'almost', 'entirely', 'uniqueness', 'context', 'said', 'modern', 'Maori', 'community', 'New', 'Zealand.Indeed', 'links', 'back', ""M'aori"", 'culture', 'community', 'had', 'strongest', 'effect', 'electrifying', 'scenes', 'Boogie', 'learning', 'do', 'haka', 'Beth', 'nostalgic', 'memories', 'life', 'traditional', 'community', 'scenes', 'where', 'Nig', 'gang', 'new', 'facial', 'tattoos', 'moments', 'were', 'beautiful', 'very', 'affecting.On', 'one', 'hand', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'family', 'anywhere', 'suffering', 'alcoholism', 'poverty', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'taken', 'way', 'film', 'make', 'much', 'impact', 'poor', 'writing', 'shaky', 'acting', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'incisive', 'look', 'how', 'modernization', 'colonization', 'globalization', 'affect', 'traditional', 'cultural', 'practices', 'particular', 'what', 'be', ""M'aori"", '21st', 'century', 'Taken', 'way', 'film', 'powerful', 'heartbreaking', 'portrayal', 'Given', 'also', 'Pacific', 'island', 'cultures', 'are', 'terribly', 'underrepresented', 'modern', 'filmmaking', 'Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'much', 'more', 'significant', '*Review', 'originally', 'published', 'Post-Punk', 'Cinema', 'Club']",Once Were Warriors VHS

It's been well documented that this tale deals with abuse, alcoholism, social, and moral dilemas; but the truth of the matter is that the big picture is more about what a person; in this case the wife of an abuser has to do to reclaim his or her dignity when, through a series of well intentioned motives, finds that life has spiraled to a point where you're faced with your own values being tested to the limit. When does a person really have enough? What does it take to get you to that place? And finally, what does it take to have the courage to make the changes necessary? I work in a treatment centre for addictions, and women's programs, and the bottom line is that everyone has to hit their own bottom to see that the life they're living is not what they expected, or want. The next step is change, and that takes courage. In this movie, the ""final straw"" is extreme, but make no mistake, it is a reality that happens to people everyday in this world.

All the characters are compelling.  There's Jake, the hard-drinking, brawling husband, always bitterly aware that he comes from a long line of slaves.  And Beth, his full-blooded Maori wife, from a royal tribal line.  Their sons: Boogie, ward of the court and sentenced to a Maori-centric boys' home; and Nig, prospecting for membership in an urban tribal gang.  There's Grace, their sensitive 13-year-old daughter, who writes fanciful stories for her younger siblings and a homeless boy who lives in a car.  And there are Jake's party-buddies, his beloved extended &quot;family&quot; -- &quot;uncles&quot; to his kids.  The accents, ethnic traditions, martial arts, and particularly the facial tattooing of the Toa will appear &quot;exotic&quot; to the American audience.

I noted that the alien nature of this film, the social aspects being slightly different, the language (It's choice, really choice.) might help American men to reflect on the film's domestic violence more readily. My councelor friend said this is exactly what happens. They feel the film is distant from themselves, so they begin to analyze what is happening. The counselor can then draw parallels between their statements and their realities.One comment the men have is that the main character ""beats his wife as you would a man."" The film features a bar brawl scene followed by a domestic violence scene. The men in counseling comment that a woman should not be hit with fists, but with an open hand if she is hit. The counselor is then able to point out the conflict in what the men have just said. A woman should NOT BE HIT at ALL!!!Moreover, this movie is not particularly realistic, because the woman is a strong character, stands up to her husband and eventually leaves him.

380596,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,630358490X,Chris Fung,"[3, 4]","Kia ora tatou (Greetings to you all),This movie is the best Aotearoan/New Zealand movie ever and one of the best of all time.  I use OWW in my anthropology classes in Hawai`i where its Polynesian ambience translates well even for those who are not PN themselves.  The power of the movie is that it transcends its location while at the same time giving a very powerful rendition of the anguish and oh so complicated mana of what it means to be Maori, urban and poor in New Zealand today.Of course, not all South Aucklanders live like this and of course not all Maori are urban, underclass and alienated from their heritage.  Nevertheless, this is a faithful evocation of the awful situations that some of our people have to deal with.  I say &quot;our&quot; because although I am not tangata whenua myself, we all (all New Zealanders) bear some responsibility for the legacy of colonialism that Tamahori so elegantly suggests in this movie. Beth's interaction with the smirking white cops in the opening minutes of the movie is a truly marvellous example of this.This is where Tamahori's movie is actually a very different vision of urban Maori culture and New Zealand society as a whole from that provided by the novel by the Maori academic Alan Duff (Once Were Warriors, Univ. of Hawai`i Press) on which the movie is based.  Duff equates the effect of white supremacy in NZ to a storm:  &quot;Do I accuse the storm that destroys my crops?  No I [do not]..., I clean up and then I PLANT AGAIN&quot;.Tamahori places the historical responsibility where it truly lies and portrays urban Maori in a more sympathetic and humane light. Duff however parcels out blame heavily on his own people. In his (dare we say bourgeois?) insistence that poor urban Maori are a bookless people who are doomed to redundancy, viciousness and poverty if they do not shake off their own self-pity, and improve themselves, Duff comes perilously close to the self-promoting &quot;I hauled mesself up by me own boot-straps&quot; argument so beloved by right-wing settlers, immigrants and self-made men.What makes OWW such a great film is that it looks the issues (and yes, the responsibilities for domestic abuse, alcoholism and violence) firmly in the eye and yet allows the people in the community the right to stand for themselves.

Being that I am an American fasinated with American urban life I decided to give Once Were Warriors a try.  I am gratified with the end result but also shocked by many of the depictions.  Life for a Maori seems plagued with many of the ills that you find in urban areas in most metropolitan or even smaller towns and cities in America.From my reserch I understand that Once Were Warriors was written by a Maori novelist that grew up in a neighboorhood similar in Wellington. I cannot judge on how realistic his depictions are but he definately does present a very engaging story.The film made me feel the emotions of every single member of the Heike clan. Ultimately, I felt sympathy for all the characters including Jake. Jake was a tragic figure that was a loveable monster.  Of all the characters, I felt the most sympathy for Grace who had an ambition to make it out of her surrounding a be more.  I will not spoil the movie but say that what happens to Grace literally turned my stomach in disgust. Just for the initial reaction shows how power this film is and why exactly it deserves a 5 star rating.Just a note: I would like to see more movies done about the Maori people that showcase also the indigenous culture and spirtual traditions of the Maori.

The actors are brilliant, many are familiar to me from local TV and films, but in this movie any preconceptions about the actors are brushed aside -they play their parts so well and so powerfully.  Rena Owen (who plays the mother Beth ""Fry-your-own-f'n-eggs"" Heke) even took it to real life, a year after the film came out she was convicted and discharged for clubbing someone on the head with a pool cue at her local pub!The violence, both at home and at the pub; the sexual abuse, the beatings and gang depictions -it all adds up to what could be a very depressing movie.

380611,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,630358490X,Jason,"[0, 0]","Once Were Warriors is a look inside a Maori family's daily life of fighting, loving, and living.  It's a view for outsiders of a proud culture and history, where men were once literally tattood, intimidating warriors capable of warding off even the most difficult adversary.The father of the family is Jake The Muss (Temuera Morrison), a belligerent, incredibly insecure drunk, who compensates by laying the beat down on anyone in his way.  He descends from a long line of slaves, and that chip on his shoulder causes the aggression.  It isn't abnormal for him to randomly walk up to a stranger at his local pub and nearly beat him into a coma.  Unfortunately for his family, they're often on the undercard for the fight.Jake's wife, Beth (Rena Owen), is the backbone of the family, the true matriarch through which all struggles are either amplified or lessened.  While far from a good mother, especially with one kid in a gang and one on the way to a juvenile home for Maoris, she's at least the one who comforts and shows love, and ultimately cares about her children's well-being.Her strength, however, leads to confrontations with Jake, who definitely doesn't like to be challenged.  And when the couple decides to have regular drinking parties at their house, inviting a large group of friends for loud singing and drunken debauchery, the violence is much more prevalent.Eventually, the story moves along and the family deals with the struggles of domestic abuse, alcoholism, irresponsibility, detachment, rape, and separation.  It's quite a roller coaster ride after a somewhat slow beginning.  It's complete madness at times, but overcoming the daily problems eventually leads to triump, and a return to a proud way of life.The one downside to this movie is the production value.  It's clear that the budget wasn't very large, and it's quite good for what was available.

This film makes ""Menace to Society"" look benevolent in comparison.""Once Were Warriors"" is a film that you are instantly bound to watch, simply because it presents a world that most people are not familiar with. I believe most Americans (me included) and others around the world have heard of the Maori - the native peoples of New Zealand. But how many can say that they have an idea of what kind of lives these people lead or what the modern day culture looks like. As far as I know, Lee Tamahori is one of the first directors to show us this culture, which many Americans will instantly compare with south central L.A. gang life and the decay of Native American reservation life.The film's opening scene is very clever. We are shown a beautiful N.Z. countryside of what most of New Zealand must have looked like before British colonization. Then the camera pulls back to reveal that it is just a billboard in the middle of the urban insanity that we are all too familiar with - concrete highways. We are then introduced to an urban ghetto where hip-hop culture looks as though it has latched on to Maori youth and bar brawling and 40 ounces are all that the rest seem to live for. Among the latter group is Jake Heke, a macho abusive drunk living with a wife to whom he shows no respect and five kids that he couldn't care less about. There are many qualities to this film and one being the characters. The local actors are superbly cast, their performances strong and complimentary. Rena Owen's performance in the film is one of the Best I have ever seen. She is powerfully convincing as the mother who strives to hold her family together. Her inner strength in the role makes the film so spellbinding. The film also boasts an infectious soundtrack of reggae-tinged pop/rock which effectively underscores the psychological tension throughout.Lee Tamahori did a great job directing this. Viewers should be warned that there are disturbing scenes of violence against the female characters. However you should not avoid the film because of this. In the end, it can be seen as an inspirational story of how inner strength and love can overcome. Being that this film was also recommended to me, I highly recommend this film as well.",5,"""You're still a slave Jake. To your fists. To the drink.

In addition to Owen's searing portrayal of Beth, Julian Arahanga gives a sharp performance as eldest son Julian, who joins a vicious Maori street gang after disowning his father, played with unnerving force by Morrison.

It is brutal, cruel, and downright violent, especially in its portrayal of domestic abuse.  Rena Owen gives a superb performance as the wife of a habitually violent husband  who turns a blind eye to her man's inability to control his temper or  provide for his family.  However her world is steadily crumbling around her  ears, and tragic change is in the air.  Her family is disintegrating.  One  of her son's is already in prison; the other is about to join a gang.  Her  eldest daughter Grace is a gifted young woman but the atmosphere at home is  crippling her, and she is soon to be victim of a vicious assault by a  friend of her father's.  Unable to cope the young girl commits suicide but  she leaves a record of the assault in her diary. And in doing so sets off a  chain of events that will result in her mother striking out and turning her  back on a life of abuse that she and her children have suffered for so  long.  This is a film about a family at war with itself and within society.  Set in New Zealand with a mainly Maori cast it shows life at its rawest  and most debased, but all the time hope shines through, and a young woman  remembers when her people &quot;once were warriors&quot; and not just the  dregs of an indifferent society.  Despite the violence this film is  beautifully crafted, well written and totally believable.  Hold your breath  for the scene when Grace's father goes on the rampage, it has to be seen to  be believed.

I can relate to a lot of things to the people in this movie as my pops use to beat on my moms a lot when I was younger. To me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen and witnessed. The power in this movie is so mighty, you wouldn't even believe it.It's not about any Maori family but families world-wide living in the struggle. I, at one point, was in that position and that's one of the reasons why I'm so in love with this movie. I can understand the pain and anger these kids had to go through as I was in the exact same position. Temuera Morrison isn't the character that you'd expect to be played Jake. But the amount of energy and effort he puts into this tells everyone that anyone can do it. His role at Jake 'The Muss' is one of the best I've seen. He puts so much energy into this character that it makes people hate on the character himself.For those who don't know the story, this is about a woman's fight for survival. Rena Owen, playing Beth Heke, is absolutely great. Beth is married to Jake 'The Muss', a ruthless fighter who has nothing to lose. Even though she gets the beats from Jake and doesn't get any support whatsoever, her love for her still stands strong. Surviving with a monster like Jake for 18 years is what I call 'guts'. This woman is hard, even harder than Jake himself. Hardly any woman would survive with a husband beating on her or cursing her most nights. Beth was different, she had a special power in her that would put her up with this. But not only her was she living through the pain, the kids too. With 5 kids, Grace and Boogie felt the most pain as they were growing up. When Beth finally realizes what is happening in life, she finally takes the right lane and cruises down it.Lee Tamahori, who also directed the latest James Bond movie, is superb. I don't know how he did it but he did and it turned out to be a classic. The acting is far beyond superb, I wouldn't even know how to rate the acting as there's no word to describe it. It touches deep in the heart to anyone and makes everyone think hard deep into life.As I've said before, it's changed the way about how I view New Zealand. I use to hate living in this country but now, I'm proud that I was born here and I'm proud that I was raised here. I thought New Zealand wasn't jacksh*t without the major producing companies but now I can finally see that any country can do it, no matter how well known they are.This movie is honestly one of the best I've seen, I can honestly say this is the most powerful movie I've seen (well, for me as I've witnessed mostly everything in this movie) but I'd have to recommend it to anyone.

It gives an intimate look of a people who have not quite shaken off their warrior roots, living in a society that rewards civility.SPOILER ALERT!  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  XTemuera Morrison and Rena Owen play Jake and Beth Heke, Parents of five, trying to make a go, if Jake were a little more responsible toward his familial duties. He also has a ""hair-trigger"" temper, along with a sizable alcohol problem, and as we all know, they don't go well together.This is a family in deep crisis. The eldest son Nig, has joined a gang (a sort of throwback to their warrior roots). Their middle son ""Boogie"", seems unable to stay clear of trouble either, being picked-up by Police in the company of real delinquents. Their eldest daughter Grace, is a shy, quiet, introverted girl, thoughtful and kind to her siblings. For some reason, we don't see much of their two youngest, and only one of them has a couple of lines in the film.Jake has an unhealthy penchant for partying and drinking (one wonders how he can afford this, as he is on the Dole), inviting his drinking buddies over to his house, with no concern towards his children. Beth is really no better, as she allows this sort of thing, and you get the sense that it has been going on for quite some time. We are witness to Jake giving Beth a ""beatdown"", for not cooking for one of his buddies, and the aftermath, which shows how little regret Jake has for his actions. It seems that Jake's routine is no more than sleeping, drinking, fighting, partying,  beating on his wife, and bullying his children.When Boogie is remanded to State Custody, Beth wants to visit him, and because of a gambling windfall, Jake comes up with the money to make it possible, but on the appointed day, Jake would rather get drunk, than see his own son. During one of Jake's parties, Grace is raped by one of Jakes ""mates"", ""Uncle Bully"" (Clifford Curtis). Finding no solace within her family or friends, she commits suicide.The cauldron boils over, as Beth is determined to take Grace's body back to her tribal land, to be buried with her people. Jake resents this, but Beth will not be swayed. After the burial, Beth discovers that Grace was raped, after reading Grace's journal/diary, by Uncle Bully. Beth goes to Jake's favorite Bar, and confronts them. It is here, that Jake shows SOME concern, and beats down Bully in a scene that makes one wonder how Clifford Curtis wasn't injured in the filming of it.X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X""Once Were Warriors"" became a hands-down favorite in New Zealand, out doing other ""Blockbuster"" films, upon it's initial release.

380628,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,630358490X,Martin Asiner,"[6, 7]","ONCE WERE WARRIORS is a gem of a movie that received little play in the United States.  And that is a shame since this film is one of the most brutal and unforgettable exposes of the disintegration of a native culture after debilitating contact with a colonially suffocating one.  Director Lee Tomahori presents a poverty-stricken subculture of the Maori tribe in New Zealand, one in which the dissolution of the formerly strong tribal bonds and rituals becomes increasingly evident in each scene.  Part of the appeal of this movie is that the theme of cultural sabotage is often repeated in many cultures--and not just in third world cultures that accept Burger King rather than their own gods as a worthy pantheon.Temuera Morrison is Jake, a brute of a husband who finds that his place in society has been undercut by a Western civilization that seems bent on putting Guess jeans on all the natives.  Jake finds it difficult to hold a job so he spends his days drinking in pubs with his mates.  He brawls, he drinks, he abuses his long suffering wife Beth (Rena Owen) whenever his self-esteem dips below a critical level.  Beth tries hard to maintain some semblance of normalcy, but with one son in prison, another seeking to join a gang, and a teenage daughter trying to face the issues of her own burgeoning sexuality in a male-dominant society, she finds this job impossible.  She loves Jake, but she hates what he has become, and there is no easy solution.Nearly all the major characters are blighted in some way by their inability to adjust to their newer and low-class status in a Western culture than relegates their own to disrepute.  Much of the film is filled with the raw violence of bar room brawls, ugly scenes of domestic abuse, and rape.  All of this violence serves to underscore the need of a disenfranchised people to look within themselves to find the pride and respect that once marked them as warriors.  Most fail, but the few who do not suggest that the recovery of basic human decency transcends cultures and borders so that any who see this marvelous movie can take heart that brutes like Jake are dinosaurs, eventually to be replaced by adaptable survivors like Beth.  The closing scene of Beth's son,now fully engaged in his gang's ritualistic dance of discipline, punctuates this most basic of human desires.",5,The Clashing of Cultures Brings Ruin,1050969600,"04 22, 2003",2003,2337,"['ONCE', 'WERE', 'WARRIORS', 'gem', 'movie', 'received', 'little', 'play', 'United', 'States', 'shame', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'unforgettable', 'exposes', 'disintegration', 'native', 'culture', 'debilitating', 'contact', 'colonially', 'suffocating', 'one', 'Director', 'Lee', 'Tomahori', 'poverty-stricken', 'subculture', 'Maori', 'tribe', 'New', 'Zealand', 'one', 'dissolution', 'formerly', 'strong', 'tribal', 'bonds', 'rituals', 'becomes', 'increasingly', 'evident', 'scene', 'Part', 'appeal', 'movie', 'theme', 'cultural', 'sabotage', 'often', 'repeated', 'many', 'cultures', 'not', 'just', 'third', 'world', 'accept', 'Burger', 'King', 'rather', 'own', 'gods', 'worthy', 'pantheon.Temuera', 'Morrison', 'Jake', 'brute', 'husband', 'who', 'place', 'society', 'been', 'undercut', 'Western', 'civilization', 'bent', 'putting', 'Guess', 'jeans', 'natives', 'Jake', 'difficult', 'hold', 'job', 'so', 'days', 'drinking', 'pubs', 'mates', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'Beth', 'Rena', 'Owen', 'whenever', 'self-esteem', 'dips', 'critical', 'level', 'Beth', 'hard', 'maintain', 'semblance', 'normalcy', 'one', 'son', 'prison', 'seeking', 'join', 'gang', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'trying', 'face', 'issues', 'own', 'burgeoning', 'sexuality', 'male-dominant', 'society', 'job', 'impossible', 'Jake', 'what', 'become', 'easy', 'solution.Nearly', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'blighted', 'way', 'inability', 'adjust', 'newer', 'low-class', 'status', 'Western', 'culture', 'own', 'disrepute', 'Much', 'film', 'filled', 'raw', 'violence', 'bar', 'room', 'brawls', 'ugly', 'scenes', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'rape', 'violence', 'underscore', 'need', 'disenfranchised', 'people', 'look', 'find', 'pride', 'respect', 'once', 'marked', 'warriors', 'Most', 'fail', 'few', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'suggest', 'recovery', 'basic', 'human', 'decency', 'cultures', 'borders', 'so', 'who', 'see', 'marvelous', 'movie', 'can', 'take', 'heart', 'Jake', 'are', 'dinosaurs', 'eventually', 'be', 'replaced', 'adaptable', 'survivors', 'Beth', 'closing', 'scene', 'Beth', 'son', 'now', 'fully', 'engaged', 'gang', 'ritualistic', 'dance', 'discipline', 'most', 'basic', 'human', 'desires']",Once Were Warriors VHS
380629,A319KYEIAZ3SON,630358490X,Mary Whipple,"[10, 11]","In a film so hard-hitting that the viewer actually feels battered by the time it reaches its conclusion, a Maori family with five children must deal with urban violence, poverty, drugs, alcoholism, unemployment, gang warfare, rape, physical and mental abuse, suicide, and a host of other horrific family problems, all shown graphically. Beth and Jake Heke and their five children, along with numerous other Maori families, live in an urban ghetto of government-supported housing, isolated from the rest of society and isolated, too, from their old rural culture, which once gave pride and a sense of identity to Maori families. Here in the city the prevailing ""culture"" centers around bars, rather than the ancient meeting houses.Beth Heke (Rena Owen), the mother, loves her violent husband Jake (Temuera Morrison), despite his abuse of her when he is drunk, and she cares deeply about her children, but she is powerless to protect them or herself from Jake's rages. The oldest son (Julian Arahanga) is part of a street gang which covers their faces in traditional tattoos and uses their own violence for protection against others. Their sensitive second son Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) has been arrested for associating with car thieves. Most touching, however, is Gracie (unforgettably played by Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), a thirteen-year-old beauty who is trying to lead a good life without any good examples to follow. Pathetically, she and the two youngest children are forced to ""grow up early,"" accepting the horrors of their lives as ""normal,"" while they try to survive any way they can.The bold, raw language of Alan Duff's novel of the same name becomes part of Riwia Brown's script, and Lee Tamahori's direction brings this powerful, absorbing, and overwhelming story of human misery to life. Tamahori uses contrasts throughout to emphasize the themes and the differences between contemporary Maori urban life and traditional Maori culture. He uses haunting Maori music to begin the film, then switches to scenes of rap and rock, he alternates quiet visions of a Maori village with loud bar activity, he shows the sweetness of Gracie against the grim living conditions of her best friend Toot (Shannon Williams), and illustrates throughout Jake's violence in contrast to the family's need for calmer, more focused lives. The cinematography, too, emphasizes the contrasts, though most viewers will be too focused on the overwhelming emotionalism of the scenes to notice. Though I loved the book, I found the film even better--the characters as acted here are much more heart-wrenching than I ever could have imagined.

Make no mistake this is a superbly crafted domestic drama of which all involved have done themselves proud. A sad homily of domestic  violence and brutality too often prevalent in the ghettoes &amp; slums of  our worlds major cities. In this case set in south Auckland, NZ. The anti  hero Jake is married to the loyal and long suffering Beth. They have two  sons, who are well on their way to emulating their fathers exploits and a  daughter, the gentle Grace who is literate and innocent. One senses that  Jake is a good and decent man with an honour code of his own. That in an  idealistic world he would do the right thing by his family and prove  himself a worthy role model for his children. Unfortunately his drunken  binges fill him with irrational rages which he takes out in graphic  violence upon his family and especially Beth his long suffering partner.  Blame it on the alcohol, the working class poverty, cultural brainwashing  or what have you. It is all endemic of a cycle of violence which for Jake  and Beth ends one night with a catalytic tragedy of his own making. Life  will never be the same. Enough said.Outsiders perhaps should be aware  that though the violence depicted in this film is not indicative of the  majority of maori families in this country the statistics show that it is  prevalent enough to figure significantly elsewhere in our courts, jails and  psychiatric institutions.

380634,A21P8800ZGRGIP,630358490X,Miketheratguy,"[6, 6]","I don't know where to start. This is one of the finest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen countless numbers. Once Were Warriors is, at its most stripped, about a woman named Beth and her struggle to just do what's best for her family. She is of Maori heritage, New Zealand's sort of Native Americans. Culture is a proud and powerful aspect of the movie, as Beth's strengths lie in her devotion to her family and her heritage. But that is little comfort, as her daughter is struggling to accept adulthood, her youngest son is heading towards juvenile detention, and her oldest son is fast on his way to joining a brutal gang. Worst of all, her husband Jake is a heavy drinker.The film excels at painting everybody in full 3 dimensions as they just do what they can to find their place. The gang is cruel to the oldest son, but at the same time embraces him. The juvenile detention center separates the youngest son from his only home, but instills in him a pride in his ancestry. And Jake himself is a beast, a man built like a tank who will destroy you with anything available should you spill his beer...but somehow he also comes across as loving Beth. Sometimes.The film follows Beth as she does her best to hold the family together even while the various problems tear them apart. At the center is Jake's drinking and further carelessness of his family's dissipation. While Beth's answer is to nurture and aid her children, Jake insists it's best to drink away the problems and quit being so ""soft"" on the kids. And we watch, through it all, as the family spirals further apart. Near the end, after seeing both happy and horrible things happen to each of the characters, we are jarred by several traumatic events. Beth and Jake both deal with it uniquely, as she draws once again on the tremendous power of family and human spirit, while Jake shows some emotions we may not expect. The last 15 minutes of the film keep us in suspense as we wonder whether a certain horrible injustice will be confronted, and if so, how.The last few moments of the movie made me want to jump to my feet and applaud. Though not all agreeable, everyone's actions are understandable. Especially those of Beth and her oldest son, whose interaction with Jake results in my favorite scene in the movie. But don't think you know what's going to happen based on this description, because believe me, you don't. I felt satisfied with the conclusion on all fronts, and thought that each character showed exactly where their strength lies.Be forewarned that this movie is very heartbreaking. Its overall tone is one of futility, of better lives not received, of wanting the best but never quite getting it. It is very raw and intense in its portrayal of physical and domestic violence, and the easily upset may have a hard time waiting to see if it ends happily enough for their tastes. But no matter what your opinion is, it will definitely be a film that stays with you for a long, long time. My highest recommendation.SEQUEL NOTE: If you liked this movie, see if you can ever find the rare ""What Becomes of the Broken Hearted"", a direct follow-up to the events in this film with the same cast. While not as good, it tells a different sort of story from a different kind of perspective and is very much worth watching for a good sense of closure to some of these characters.",5,"Moving and raw, beautiful yet stark.

In some ways, despite this, the movie did present surprising elements and messages that were not so well publicised in the media.Focusing on a troubled family of urban Maori, the story revolves around the Heke family, with the mother battling to keep things together in the face of the violence and rage of her husband, Jake ""The Muss"" Heke.With an emphasis on heritage and who people really are, the movie goes beyond the shocking violence, and gives hope of something better. It is a surprisingly positive movie, that presents tragedy as a catalyst for positive change. It is in the midst of loss and misfortune that people find themselves and are moved to something better. Of course, Jake provides the counter-point of attempting to deal with it in his own violent way, as he has done throughout the movie.With supreme performances from Temuera Morrison, Rena Owen, Cliff Curtis and many others, Lee Tamahori has directed a masterpiece of a movie. Violent, brutal, and honest, the movie also gives a profound message of hope and self-knowledge. Take the tissues, but also be prepared to be spoken to at a deep level.

If anyone comes to New Zealand, you can pick up a perfect widescreen, 5.1 Dolby Digital version with features such as cast interviews, music videos, trailers, Director's commentry and no annoying subtitles. Once Were Warriors tells a story that can be translated into any language yet have the same impact. Domestic violence is the topic of this brutal film from acclaimed New Zealand director Lee Tamahori. Considering I come from New Zealand myself, I can not get the point across strongly enough that New Zealand is a beautiful country and the scenes in the film only portrayed a small portion of how NZ was in 1995 when the movie was set. For a real view on how my country is, take a look at the scenery of 'The Lord Of The Rings' from another visionary NZ director, Peter Jackson.Once Were Warriors follows a Maori family living at the bottom of the economic pool. There is Beth, the mother of four children. The eldest son Nick, has become estranged from the family and joined a gang because of his hatred for his abusive father, Jake. Next is the smart and beautiful 13 year old Grace stuck in a life that is far from fit for her. Mark, the second eldest boy has made friends with local thieves and spends most of his time on the streets, so he gets sent off to Social Welfare. The youngest boy gets the least screen time of the children.Temuera Morrison's portrayal of 'Jake the Muss' is done with fire in his eyes. Originally it was believed that he was not right for the part, but he proved them wrong. His acting and Rena Owen's (Beth) pushed the boundaries of acting and reality. The film came away with 12 International Awards. To tell you the truth, it should be been given Oscars. Another star who should not go without credit is Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell who plays Grace. She did an amazing job for her first acting role.Well worth buying this film.

380639,A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9,630358490X,"NyiNya ""NyiNya""","[0, 0]","From the sly opening sequence to very last frame of Jake, alone and broken, ""Once Were Warriors"" doesn't let up. Emotional reactions come hard and fast; it's impossible not to hit the pause button at least once for a quick time-out. Bloody bar fights, domestic violence, rape...this is without a doubt the most brutal film I've ever seen, and the saddest. When that jarring guitar assault signals the end of the film, I defy any viewer not to feel pole-axed.Jake Heke--or Jake the Muss to his friends--is a tough guy. Pour enough beer into him and he's take on all comers, including his wife and kids, and beat them senseless.  Jake is descended from the world's fiercest fighters, but by 1990, those who once were warriors were on the dole, drinking themselves stupid on cheap beer and following the usual trajectory of aboriginal people when their society is unraveled and replaced by a force feeding of Western religion and Western contempt in equal doses.Temuera Morrison, a former New Zealand soap opera heart throb, is responsible for much of the heart and soul of the film.  He gives such a nuanced performance, we're forced to understand -- almost to forgive -- Jake's kneejerk savagery. One minute we're repulsed and the next we want to cry for this poor, shattered soul. Jake's wife, Beth, beautifully played by Rena Owens, is from a higher caste and more tied to her Maori roots...but over the years, Jake has beaten her ""manna"" -- her spirit -- out of her.Jake's sons, ironically, find their own ways back to some semblance of Maori culture. Eldest son Nig wears his street gang's ta moko--facial tattoos--like the old warriors. In the same way that Japanese Yakuda resurrected Samuria elements, although in a corrupted manner, into their rituals, Maori gangbangers weave parts of their past into new traditions. Second son Boog ends up in a reform school run by a teacher who shows his charges how to ""wear their tattoos on the inside.""For all their fierceness, it's not the men in this film who are the real warriors. It's Jake's wife, a woman born with warrior DNA, who prevails in the end and finds the strength to effect a change for her family. But most of all, it's Grace, the eldest daughter, who holds things together, who helps Beth when Jake beats her half to death, who picks up the pieces when her parents' drinking or battling leave things in chaos. Grace writes poetry and dreams of a life where drinking and hitting or being hit aren't the only reality. She protects the younger kids from the worst of Jake's temper, giving them their only haven in a home defined by drunken parties, drunken sex, drunken beatings.  It's around her that the tragedy that is the heart and catalyst of ""Once Were Warriors"" revolves.The beatings Jake dishes out are hard to watch, but are as essential to the reality and impact of the film, as they are to his character. Brutality is his only means of self-expression. A warrior without a cause, he's proving his manhood by punching his wife unconscious at home and busting skulls at the saloon. Jake the Muss is such an iconic figure, and Morrison's portrayal is so human and moving, we're forced to look past the violence. Jake is the character who ultimately breaks your heart in this heartbreaking movie.""Once Were Warriors"" is unforgettable.(The Alan Duff novel ""Once Were Warriors"" on which the movie is based is excellent.

Alas, I never found the words to perfectly describe the movie's beauty and power. Because really this movie is beyond words and beyond moving pictures.Once Were Warriors is a movie about a poor Maori family. Jake is unemployed and is also an alcoholic. His wife doesn't work and his children are heading straight for the life of crime and no future. A suicide in the family forces the family to reevaluate their culture, their friends and their complacency. (I am aware that I am being vague, but I have opted to do so, because I believe that the viewer is entitled to know as little about the plot as posssible preceding the viewing. Read another review for more plot).Before watching this film, I hadn't the slightest clue as to what it was about. The beginning didn't give me too many hints either, but it could have gone in a thousand directions. The first half of the movie shows us the disintegration of the family. One son is sent to a Maori boarding school where he learns about his culture, another is initiated into a Maori street gang with tatoos on their faces just like those worn by traditional Maori warriors, the Mother gets beaten, and the daughter finds no place to go.About halfway through this movie, I had a dirty t-shirt in my hand and began to wipe the tears from my face with it every few seconds. My roomates were in the room and I was doing everything in my power to hide my emotions, but alas they probably leaked out (quite literally). As an 18 year old male, I seldom cry while  watching films. Instead I typically laugh at the emotional scenes ,while everyone else has a tissue to their face. For some reason, Once Were Warriors managed to break down my defences and open the floodgates. It wasn't that the act itself was so horrible, there are many movies with far worse instances of abuse and hopelessness, but somehow the presentation of the suicide transcended any presentation of a death that I have ever seen before.So far, I have only gotten halfway through the film... but the movie keeps improving from there. The decisions made by Jake's wife and his son Nig reflect true and utter power and conviction. Each scene was acted out to its utter potential, each line (especially the line ""once were warriors"") reflects true and pure emotion of the characters, actually, I'll call them people because they were nothing short of it.I could write a thousand essays on this movie, analyzing each action and each subtext, but alas, I will just suggest that everyone see this movie, for it is more than just watching a film is a literal experience in the brutality and reality of the life of a family. Watch it alone with a clear mind and I am sure that any viewer will be able to experience the movies sheer intensity.",5,Transcendent movie.,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2867,"['have', 'seen', 'movie', 'month', 'ago', 'have', 'wanted', 'write', 'review', 'ten', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Alas', 'never', 'found', 'words', 'perfectly', 'describe', 'movie', 'beauty', 'power', 'really', 'movie', 'words', 'moving', 'pictures.Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'movie', 'poor', 'Maori', 'family', 'Jake', 'unemployed', 'also', 'alcoholic', 'wife', ""n't"", 'work', 'children', 'are', 'heading', 'straight', 'life', 'crime', 'future', 'suicide', 'family', 'family', 'reevaluate', 'culture', 'friends', 'complacency', 'am', 'aware', 'am', 'being', 'vague', 'have', 'opted', 'do', 'so', 'believe', 'viewer', 'entitled', 'know', 'as', 'little', 'plot', 'posssible', 'preceding', 'viewing', 'Read', 'review', 'more', 'plot', '.Before', 'watching', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'slightest', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'many', 'hints', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'thousand', 'directions', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'disintegration', 'family', 'One', 'son', 'sent', 'Maori', 'boarding', 'school', 'where', 'culture', 'initiated', 'Maori', 'street', 'gang', 'tatoos', 'just', 'worn', 'traditional', 'Maori', 'warriors', 'Mother', 'beaten', 'daughter', 'place', 'go.About', 'halfway', 'movie', 'had', 'dirty', 't-shirt', 'hand', 'began', 'wipe', 'tears', 'face', 'few', 'seconds', 'roomates', 'were', 'room', 'was', 'doing', 'everything', 'power', 'hide', 'emotions', 'probably', 'leaked', 'out', 'quite', 'literally', '18', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'seldom', 'cry', 'watching', 'films', 'Instead', 'typically', 'laugh', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'else', 'tissue', 'face', 'reason', 'Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'managed', 'break', 'down', 'defences', 'open', 'floodgates', 'was', ""n't"", 'act', 'was', 'so', 'horrible', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'far', 'worse', 'instances', 'abuse', 'hopelessness', 'somehow', 'presentation', 'suicide', 'transcended', 'presentation', 'death', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'before.So', 'far', 'have', 'only', 'gotten', 'halfway', 'film', 'movie', 'improving', 'there', 'decisions', 'made', 'Jake', 'wife', 'son', 'Nig', 'reflect', 'true', 'utter', 'power', 'conviction', 'scene', 'was', 'acted', 'out', 'utter', 'potential', 'line', 'especially', 'line', 'once', 'were', 'warriors', 'true', 'pure', 'emotion', 'characters', 'actually', ""'ll"", 'call', 'people', 'were', 'nothing', 'short', 'it.I', 'could', 'write', 'thousand', 'essays', 'movie', 'analyzing', 'action', 'subtext', 'alas', 'will', 'just', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'see', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'watching', 'film', 'literal', 'experience', 'brutality', 'reality', 'life', 'family', 'Watch', 'alone', 'clear', 'mind', 'am', 'sure', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'experience', 'movies', 'sheer', 'intensity']",Once Were Warriors VHS

(Note:  Temeura Morrison later stated that he was &quot;scarred&quot; for quite a while emotionally and mentally after  playing Jake.)  The unexcelled acting in AND the directing of this film, in  this viewer's opinion,  show the exact nature of family violence more  clearly than other presentation in any media ever has.  At first I was  unwilling to see another film dealing with the subject, especially since I  the results of domestic violence almost daily on my job.  Now I say that if  you watch only one film on the matter in your life, make it this one.  For  an American viewer, the fact that all the action takes place in Auckland,  New Zealand helps give the distance needed for an honest perspective on the  theme.  Then the highly skilled actors (may we see more of all of  them!)play the story out as it happens to thousands of families all over  the world, totally stripping domestic violence of any excuse to be.  By the  heart-rending and horrific end of the movie there can be no doubt in  anyone's mind that neither substance abuse, cultural conditioning,  disenfranchised cultures, poverty nor a host of other things often invoked  as &quot;reasons&quot; justify turning one's household into a war zone.  Most family violence perpetrators are not hardcore psychopaths; they are  &quot;Jakes&quot;, and they have no excuse for what they do to their  families.  A beautiful film that makes its point without resulting to  melodrama and sensationalism.  It's a credit to all involved with the  production that we look in on the lives of one family in crisis and  realize, knowing that this scene is repeated thousands of time daily  worldwide, the ultimate devastation brought about by &quot;routine&quot;  family violence.

380648,A3T689SS856U3N,630358490X,Vincent Lassauw,"[1, 1]","This movie, impressively, describes the daily reality of a Maori family in New Zealand and puts a stop straight away to any romantic myths one might harbor considering the Maori people. This is perfectly illustrated with the opening shot in which we look at a beautiful landscape with a sun soaked lake, marvelous trees and hills. The camera however moves back somewhat and reality sets in: we were looking at a bill board and as a matter of fact we find ourselves near a highway winding itself through the slums of Auckland, New Zealand.Its director, Lee Tamahori weaves, in a truly unforgettable way, the torturous existence of the Heke family, a tapestry of which the strains have been dyed in blood, sweat and tears, even though in some spots specks of sunlight can be noticed, but the chain of dramatic events that lead to a tragic unraveling, prove unstoppable.Tamahori is far from gentle with the audience and the impact of the at times extremely violent scenes at times hit with the force of a sledge hammer. These images show a family trapped in social-economic hopelessness, to which the only escape seems to be through alcohol and/or sexual abuse and fortunately, every once in a while, a beautiful song. As head of the family, Jake, magnificently portrayed by Temuera Morrison, in this sense also takes the lead through physical violence in what he considers maintaining his pride in a world that will not allow him any otherwise. As these attempts fail on a regular basis, he takes out his frustration and subsequent rage on his family, especially his wife, an equally impressive portrayal by Rena Owen, who seems to be the victim but in the end is the only one maintaining her dignity and pride.When we first meet this family, it's clear it has been suffering under these circumstances for years, causing family ties to be strenuous to say the least, if they haven't already been irreparably damaged as they are between Jake and both his sons Nig, Sonny (who we only meet in the sequel to this movie ""What becomes of the broken hearted"") and young Mark.Their mother already has a hard time making ends meet, so the children are mostly left to their own devices.Dramatic events follow, mostly ensuing from Jake's violent nature and selfishness, until a climactic event becomes the turning point in the movie and the lives of all involved will change definitively and will also be engraved in the viewer's soul.",5,Unforgettable and powerful drama,1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,2423,"['movie', 'impressively', 'daily', 'reality', 'Maori', 'family', 'New', 'Zealand', 'stop', 'straight', 'away', 'romantic', 'myths', 'one', 'might', 'harbor', 'considering', 'Maori', 'people', 'perfectly', 'illustrated', 'opening', 'shot', 'look', 'beautiful', 'landscape', 'sun', 'soaked', 'lake', 'marvelous', 'trees', 'hills', 'camera', 'however', 'back', 'somewhat', 'reality', 'sets', 'were', 'looking', 'bill', 'board', 'matter', 'fact', 'find', 'highway', 'winding', 'slums', 'Auckland', 'New', 'Zealand.Its', 'director', 'Lee', 'Tamahori', 'weaves', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'way', 'torturous', 'existence', 'Heke', 'family', 'tapestry', 'strains', 'have', 'been', 'dyed', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'even', 'spots', 'specks', 'sunlight', 'can', 'be', 'noticed', 'chain', 'dramatic', 'events', 'lead', 'tragic', 'unraveling', 'prove', 'unstoppable.Tamahori', 'far', 'gentle', 'audience', 'impact', 'times', 'extremely', 'violent', 'scenes', 'times', 'hit', 'force', 'sledge', 'hammer', 'images', 'show', 'family', 'trapped', 'social-economic', 'hopelessness', 'only', 'escape', 'be', 'alcohol', 'and/or', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'fortunately', 'once', 'while', 'beautiful', 'song', 'head', 'family', 'Jake', 'magnificently', 'portrayed', 'Temuera', 'Morrison', 'sense', 'also', 'lead', 'physical', 'violence', 'what', 'maintaining', 'pride', 'world', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'otherwise', 'attempts', 'fail', 'regular', 'basis', 'out', 'frustration', 'subsequent', 'rage', 'family', 'especially', 'wife', 'equally', 'impressive', 'portrayal', 'Rena', 'Owen', 'who', 'be', 'victim', 'end', 'only', 'one', 'maintaining', 'dignity', 'pride.When', 'first', 'meet', 'family', 'clear', 'been', 'suffering', 'circumstances', 'years', 'causing', 'family', 'ties', 'be', 'strenuous', 'say', 'least', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'irreparably', 'damaged', 'are', 'Jake', 'sons', 'Nig', 'Sonny', 'who', 'only', 'meet', 'sequel', 'movie', 'What', 'broken', 'hearted', 'young', 'Mark.Their', 'mother', 'already', 'hard', 'time', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'children', 'are', 'mostly', 'left', 'own', 'devices.Dramatic', 'events', 'follow', 'mostly', 'ensuing', 'Jake', 'violent', 'nature', 'selfishness', 'climactic', 'event', 'turning', 'point', 'movie', 'lives', 'involved', 'will', 'change', 'definitively', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'engraved', 'viewer', 'soul']",Once Were Warriors VHS

Released at a time when NZ films weren't widely accepted, yet when audiences saw it ... they changed their minds.  This was the most talked about film in Australia in 1994.  It's one of those rare movies that made me cry.Incredible performances from both male and female leads which contribute to the powerfulness of this film.  The sequel from 1998 called &quot;What Becomes of the Broken Hearted&quot; is worth seeing, but not a patch on ONCE WERE WARRIORS.Buy it, rent it, or whatever ... just get yourself a copy.

It is a very compelling story of a woman trying to hold her family together with a father who is more concerned with drinking and partying than really taking care of his family. The strength of this mother, especially towards the end of the movie is incredible as she finally stands up to her husband and moves her children to a better place. Very heart-wrenching death scene (you'll see what I mean when you watch it) and I love the sense of completion the movie presents. The negative people have a negative end and the positive people go on with their lives.
