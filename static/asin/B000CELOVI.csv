Scott Baio stars as Charles, a College student who takes a job as a live-in babysitter. The family in the first season is pretty lame, so glad they get rid of them after this season.

957549,AMA6SPA2A43JH,B000CELOVI,Cassie,"[0, 0]","I have Likes and Dislikes about both versions. I originally started watching back then because of Scott Baio. He and Willie Aames are the best of the show. It doesn't matter to me which family as long as they are on. I like Stan, Jill, and Ellen. I think Jamie and Sarah are better than Lila. I like Jason and Adam the same. I can't stand Douglas. He acts like he is in need of severe counseling.Paula Thacker also is in need of severe counseling. I don't likeWalter Powell any more than Grandma Pembroke. I could do without either one of them. One thing I wish the writers had done was show a flashback episode showing how Charles got his job with the Pembrokes. Showing him applying for the job and everything. We know how he started working for the Powells, but not the Pembrokes. On the episode ""Date With Enid"" everyone acts like Douglas doesn't judge by outward appearance, but he did. He only like her the way she was, judging soley by her appearance, what appearance he wanted her to have. If he wasn't judging by appearance he would have liked her either way, but he didn't. On episode ""Discipline"" I would have flunked Douglas too. I also wouold have flunked his other papers about having a summer vacation on Venus and his being a fictionalcharacter. It would of been different is his assignment had been about a fantasy summer vacation or writing about anyone he wants and no mention about fictional.

Gwendolyn Pierce was a recurring theme of many of the Charles in Charge Season One episodes. Charles in Charge Season One, is very different than Charles in Charge Season Two. Scott Baio stars as Charles. He is a college student living in the Pembroke family home while he attends college and hangs out with his best friend Buddy. The Pembroke family are not quite as exciting or interesting to watch as the Powell family who were featured on the show starting with the second season until the show ended it's run. An easy way to tell the two families apart is the Powell family had blonde hair for the most part and the Pembroke's were darker haired.So season one is a fun season to watch primarily because of the antics of Charles and Buddy. There are also a lot of up and coming stars featured in season one. Meg Ryan appears in one episode as a young woman wanting to hire a nanny or all in one like Charles. It's a fun season where Charles primarily crushes on Gwendolyn, dates Gwendolyn or pursues other girls.The box set is nice. The color discs are not dual sided as many Universal releases have been. The set also includes a half hour feature titled ""The Great 80's TV Flashbacks,"" and a bonus episode from Charles in Charge season 2.The bottom line is pick up this set and buy it. Hopefully brisk sales will quicken the release of Charles in Charge Season 2.

But through the years the 80's has always been my favorite decade when it comes to music, movies, and TV...so, it was not a surprise that I decided to buy this DVD! It took me a little while to warm up to it. There are times when the plot sags, though the cast always does a pretty good job of making the best of it.After watching a few episodes, I really started to enjoy ""Charles in Charge."" I like the simplicity of some of the episodes -- there aren't a million different subplots going on, so the actors really can delve into the storyline! And the kids were all very adept at their roles. Michael Pearlman was very cute and perfectly captured the sentiments of his character, Jason, with great sensitivity and zest! Jonathan Ward portrayed the zany Douglas astutely. And April Lerman (Lila) definitely had something special -- she really should have gone further in the biz!There is one element of the show's premise that requires some suspension of disbelief. While Charles is supposed to be in charge since the parents are so busy, you'll notice that the parents are ""there"" quite a lot. More often than not, the writing makes it seem that the parents are there but don't know how to deal with certain issues in raising their kids -- so they just tell Charles to take care of it. Other times, they seem to have the answers, yet they apparently are so fond of Charles in those moments that they leave it to him to figure out. A little strange in my opinion, but that's sitcoms for ya!All in all, this DVD is a worthy investment for avid fans of 80's sitcoms. From all I've read, the later seasons -- with Charles taking care of a totally different family -- were far more popular and remain better known. I haven't seen those yet, so can't comment on them. But I can definitely say that this first season is a hidden treasure in the books of 80's sitcoms.

Resurrecting the careers of both Scott Baio (`Happy Days', `Joannie Loves Chachie') and Willie Aames (`Eight is Enough') this season is classic camp television with some genuinely good surprises tucked awayNineteen-year old Charles is hired by Jill (Julie Cobb) and Stan Pembroke (James Widdoes) to watch over their very rambunctious kids: Lila, 14 (April Lerhman); Douglas, 12 (Jonathan Ward); and Jason, 10 (Michael Pearlman).  We never learn Charles's last name, but I remain convinced that Charles's last name  is `Arcola'-because `Charles' also was the birth name of Baio's character on both `Happy Days' and `Joannie Loves Chachi'!In this 22-episode 1984-1985 first season (the only one on NBC), Charles is very clean-cut, and his best friend Buddy Lembeck (Aames) is quite the devious schemer.  When the Pembrokes really leave Charles in charge for the night, he and Lila discover the dates they both subsequently invited over ultimately feel objectified. We see Charles's date Gwendolyn Pierce (Jennifer Runyon) throughout the rest of this season.Coming to think of his extra curricular activity AS taking care of the Pembroke kids (""Extracurricular Activity"") Charles clearly is very special. Very few college students want to spend time as a live-in-nanny, regardless of how obviously angelic the kids and/or parents are. The type of stuff Charles handles is really mild though; none of the kids EVER take drugs...etc.I developed a new and totally unexpected appreciation for this series after going through both college and graduate school's many stresses. The writers more or less accurately captured college student's struggle trying to balance everything out in their own lives while having enough money to live that life. `Charles' subsequently was much more realistic in its depictions than the `college years' of many other TV shows (90210, Saved By The Bell...etc)..Episodes like ""Another Saturday Night"" clearly set the series in the 1980's. All of the kids AND Charles are home watching election return results on a Saturday night because Michael Jackson is rumored to make a special appearance at a campaign headquarters. The kids sincerely feel down when Jackson's appearance ultimately gets cancelled due to unfavorable election returns. Contrasting with today, Jackson genuinely was a big entertainment draw in the 1980s.Meg Ryan makes a special guest star as ""Jane"" a college student thinking of becoming a nanny for the neighboring Wilson's. However, after spending time with Charles, she realizes that working with kids and their problems are not HER strong point; she subsequently gets another job. Being a nanny is not for everybody.The production team genuinely did a good job with the extras. Extras for this season include ""The great 80's TV flashback""",4,Charles takes charge in Season One,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,2934,"['Well', 'before', 'metrosexual', 'became', 'common', 'term', 'networks', 'had', 'macho', 'Italian', 'American', 'men', 'taking', 'up', 'domestic', 'work', 'such', 'house', 'cleaning', 'child', 'care', 'Resurrecting', 'careers', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Joannie', 'Chachie', 'Willie', 'Aames', 'Eight', 'Enough', 'season', 'classic', 'camp', 'television', 'genuinely', 'good', 'surprises', 'tucked', 'awayNineteen-year', 'old', 'Charles', 'hired', 'Jill', 'Julie', 'Cobb', 'Stan', 'Pembroke', 'James', 'Widdoes', 'watch', 'over', 'very', 'rambunctious', 'kids', 'Lila', '14', 'April', 'Lerhman', 'Douglas', '12', 'Jonathan', 'Ward', 'Jason', '10', 'Michael', 'Pearlman', 'never', 'learn', 'Charles', 'last', 'name', 'remain', 'convinced', 'Charles', 'last', 'name', ""Arcola'-because"", 'Charles', 'also', 'was', 'birth', 'name', 'Baio', 'character', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Joannie', 'Loves', 'Chachi', '22-episode', '1984-1985', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'one', 'NBC', 'Charles', 'very', 'clean-cut', 'best', 'friend', 'Buddy', 'Lembeck', 'Aames', 'quite', 'devious', 'schemer', 'When', 'Pembrokes', 'really', 'leave', 'Charles', 'charge', 'night', 'Lila', 'discover', 'dates', 'subsequently', 'invited', 'over', 'ultimately', 'feel', 'objectified', 'see', 'Charles', 'date', 'Gwendolyn', 'Pierce', 'Jennifer', 'Runyon', 'rest', 'season.Coming', 'think', 'extra', 'curricular', 'activity', 'taking', 'care', 'Pembroke', 'kids', 'Extracurricular', 'Activity', 'Charles', 'clearly', 'very', 'special', 'Very', 'few', 'college', 'students', 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'live-in-nanny', 'regardless', 'how', 'obviously', 'kids', 'parents', 'are', 'type', 'stuff', 'Charles', 'really', 'mild', 'none', 'kids', 'EVER', 'take', 'drugs', 'etc.I', 'developed', 'new', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'appreciation', 'series', 'going', 'college', 'graduate', 'school', 'many', 'stresses', 'writers', 'more', 'less', 'accurately', 'captured', 'college', 'student', 'struggle', 'trying', 'balance', 'everything', 'own', 'lives', 'having', 'enough', 'money', 'live', 'life', 'Charles', 'subsequently', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'depictions', 'college', 'years', 'many', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', '90210', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'etc', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'clearly', 'set', 'series', '1980', 'kids', 'Charles', 'are', 'home', 'watching', 'election', 'return', 'results', 'Saturday', 'night', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'rumored', 'make', 'special', 'appearance', 'campaign', 'headquarters', 'kids', 'sincerely', 'feel', 'down', 'when', 'Jackson', 'appearance', 'ultimately', 'cancelled', 'due', 'unfavorable', 'election', 'returns', 'Contrasting', 'today', 'Jackson', 'genuinely', 'was', 'big', 'entertainment', 'draw', '1980s.Meg', 'Ryan', 'special', 'guest', 'star', 'Jane', 'college', 'student', 'thinking', 'becoming', 'nanny', 'neighboring', 'Wilson', 'However', 'spending', 'time', 'Charles', 'working', 'kids', 'problems', 'are', 'not', 'HER', 'strong', 'point', 'subsequently', 'job', 'Being', 'nanny', 'not', 'everybody.The', 'production', 'team', 'genuinely', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'extras', 'Extras', 'season', 'include', 'great', '80', 'TV', 'flashback']",Charles in Charge: The Complete First Season

So before buying this first season I didnt think I would like it much or as much as the other seasons. Because their is a different cast. However after watching the first season I was sad to see the original cast go and the series bringing in a mostly new cast. A bonus for fans of the first season cast only this set does include the first episode of the 2nd season that has the youngest kid and the mom. Sad thing about it the lady who played the mom in season 1 wouldnt come back to do the 1st episode of the 2nd season.,5,Better Than Thought - Love The Series & Season,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,633,"['do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'seeing', 'many', 'episodes', 'season', 'was', 'pretty', 'young', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'buying', 'first', 'season', 'didnt', 'think', 'would', 'like', 'much', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'seasons', 'different', 'cast', 'However', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'original', 'cast', 'go', 'series', 'bringing', 'mostly', 'new', 'cast', 'bonus', 'fans', 'first', 'season', 'cast', 'only', 'set', 'include', 'first', 'episode', '2nd', 'season', 'youngest', 'kid', 'mom', 'Sad', 'thing', 'lady', 'who', 'played', 'mom', 'season', '1', 'wouldnt', 'come', 'back', 'do', '1st', 'episode', '2nd', 'season']",Charles in Charge: The Complete First Season

Scott plays Charles ( he doesnt have a last name), who takes care of the Pembroke family's children Jason  (a rembuncious young boy), Douglas ( a very odd teenager who is intersted in the other planets, since he was probably hatched on it), and Lila a typical young girl.The reason why this season gets 3 stars is because, although it introduces Charles and his good natured but quite dumb friend Buddy to the audience, Scott Baio has absolutley no chemistry with the actors, and it shows making this the worst season to get.
