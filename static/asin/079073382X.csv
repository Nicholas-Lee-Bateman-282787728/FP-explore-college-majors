101638,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,079073382X,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[3, 4]","Before Sunrise is a successful film by Richard Linklater (Slacker) starring Ethan Hawke (Dead Poet's Society) and the gorgeous Julie Delpy.  The two meet on a train from Budapest to Vienna and decide to spend the day in Vienna.  Their conversation is always interesting and philosophical, and the incidental characters they meet add humor and European atmosphere.The main feeling it gives you is the feeling of freedom, traveling in Europe carefree.  I've traveled myself in Europe like this, though the fantasy of having a &quot;10&quot; fall in love with me on a train never came true.  As for the conversation, one example is when Hawke talks about reincarnation: &quot;If we're reincarnated we are only 1/1000th of a soul, considering there were only a million people on Earth 1000 years ago&quot;.  An interesting, but half-baked idea.I would've responded, &quot;We are all part of universal consciousness, we aren't separate entities, that's an illusion.&quot;When Delpy says how her shrink thought she was a homicidal killer because of her fictional writing, it really drives home how much shrinks project and tend to think the worst in people; i.e. anti-humanists in a profession that should be made up of humanists.The characters they meet like the actor who plays a cow adds some great humor as well as the fortune teller (you're learning..50 shillings please) and the homeless poet: &quot;nice cakes, and milkshakes&quot;.  They were good vehicles to show Hawke as a symbol of American cynicism and Delpy one of European naive optimism.  There is a spontaneous realistic feel to it, the dialogue seems off-the-cuff yet intelligent, and my suspicion is Linklater was using his own semi-autobiographic incident.Another touch of realism in the dialogue is when Delpy talks about the war in Bosnia.  I'll take low-budget with good dialogue over high-budget with poor dialogue any day.",5,"Chance Meeting in Europe; has depth, humor, and romance",1066521600,"10 19, 2003",2003,1891,"['Sunrise', 'successful', 'film', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Slacker', 'starring', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'gorgeous', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'two', 'meet', 'train', 'Budapest', 'Vienna', 'decide', 'spend', 'day', 'Vienna', 'conversation', 'always', 'interesting', 'philosophical', 'incidental', 'characters', 'meet', 'add', 'humor', 'European', 'atmosphere.The', 'main', 'feeling', 'feeling', 'freedom', 'traveling', 'Europe', 'carefree', ""'ve"", 'traveled', 'Europe', 'fantasy', 'having', 'quot', '10', 'quot', 'fall', 'love', 'train', 'never', 'came', 'true', 'conversation', 'one', 'example', 'when', 'Hawke', 'talks', 'reincarnation', 'quot', ""'re"", 'reincarnated', 'are', 'only', '1/1000th', 'soul', 'considering', 'were', 'only', 'million', 'people', 'Earth', '1000', 'years', 'ago', 'quot', 'interesting', 'half-baked', 'idea.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'responded', 'quot', 'are', 'part', 'universal', 'consciousness', 'are', ""n't"", 'separate', 'entities', 'illusion.', 'quot', 'When', 'Delpy', 'how', 'shrink', 'thought', 'was', 'homicidal', 'killer', 'fictional', 'writing', 'really', 'home', 'how', 'much', 'shrinks', 'project', 'tend', 'think', 'worst', 'people', 'i.e', 'anti-humanists', 'profession', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'humanists.The', 'characters', 'meet', 'actor', 'who', 'cow', 'great', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'fortune', 'teller', ""'re"", 'learning..50', 'shillings', 'please', 'homeless', 'poet', 'quot', 'nice', 'cakes', 'milkshakes', 'quot', 'were', 'good', 'vehicles', 'show', 'Hawke', 'symbol', 'American', 'cynicism', 'Delpy', 'one', 'European', 'naive', 'optimism', 'spontaneous', 'realistic', 'feel', 'dialogue', 'off-the-cuff', 'yet', 'intelligent', 'suspicion', 'Linklater', 'was', 'using', 'own', 'semi-autobiographic', 'incident.Another', 'touch', 'realism', 'dialogue', 'when', 'Delpy', 'talks', 'war', 'Bosnia', ""'ll"", 'take', 'low-budget', 'good', 'dialogue', 'high-budget', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'day']",N/A
101639,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,079073382X,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 19]","I would like to stress again that the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy was near to nothing. I saw no sparks, no interest, and no bond. It was as if Hawke hated everything that Delpy did (see the poet and the fortuneteller), while Delpy just was looking for an American man to spend the day with. I felt as if she was trying to create that special moment from nothing, as if it was her goal for the entire evening with Hawke. She wanted to have one of those romantic evening for two in Vienna, and I caught from her character that anyone with half-a-brain would do well for the adventure. That person, in this case, happened to be Ethan Hawke. So, they attempt to have these moments, forcibly interrupted by Hawke trying to throw a kiss in there every once in awhile that wasn't scripted (to seem more ""real"") that only made Delpy seem disgusted. I just felt that when these two did kiss, they didn't really enjoy it as much as they should have. As I think about this point, I can't help but think of a line that Celine uses in this film. She states,""No, then it sounds like a male fantasy. Meet a French girl on the train, have her, and never see her again.""What if this was reversed on Celine, perhaps she was trying to find a man on a train, have him, then never sees him again. When I first met these characters, that was my initial thought. I did not see them together for the long haul, but after they talked for an hour and a half, I guess they had to fall in love. This was a totally mismatched pair by director Richard Linklater, and when you only have two main focuses in the film, I would have to say that should be your only job ... ensuring that you have two people that actually build chemistry on the scene. Hawke and Delpy did not.Speaking of Richard Linklater (director of School of Rock), I do not think that he had a good grasp of this film from the beginning. I think he was attempting to show, without too much of a script, if two people could fall in love after a chance meeting on a train. What would be the ""real"" reactions, and how would it ultimately end? Sorry to say that Linklater does a poor job with this film, especially the ending where it doesn't even have a successful climax. That's the worst part of the film-it keeps on going and going, but it really overstays its welcome and becomes too repetitive towards the end. That was not helping him at all by having this slow ending.I have heard people quote this film as the ""greatest love story"" ever. I would have to differ with them because of the characterization and portrayal of our Jesse and Celine. Both were uncomfortable, unstructured, and fractured in their parts and it was obvious through the screen. I have seen better love stories, and better stories will continue to be released!Grade: ** out of *****",2,Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved more?,1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,2799,"['would', 'like', 'stress', 'again', 'chemistry', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'was', 'nothing', 'saw', 'sparks', 'interest', 'bond', 'was', 'Hawke', 'hated', 'everything', 'Delpy', 'did', 'see', 'poet', 'fortuneteller', 'Delpy', 'just', 'was', 'looking', 'American', 'man', 'spend', 'day', 'felt', 'was', 'trying', 'create', 'special', 'moment', 'nothing', 'was', 'goal', 'entire', 'evening', 'Hawke', 'wanted', 'have', 'one', 'romantic', 'evening', 'two', 'Vienna', 'caught', 'character', 'anyone', 'half-a-brain', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'adventure', 'person', 'case', 'happened', 'be', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'So', 'attempt', 'have', 'moments', 'forcibly', 'interrupted', 'Hawke', 'trying', 'throw', 'kiss', 'once', 'awhile', 'was', ""n't"", 'scripted', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'only', 'made', 'Delpy', 'seem', 'disgusted', 'just', 'felt', 'when', 'two', 'did', 'kiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'think', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'line', 'Celine', 'film', 'No', 'then', 'male', 'fantasy', 'Meet', 'French', 'girl', 'train', 'have', 'her', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'What', 'was', 'reversed', 'Celine', 'perhaps', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'man', 'train', 'have', 'then', 'never', 'again', 'When', 'first', 'met', 'characters', 'was', 'initial', 'thought', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'together', 'long', 'haul', 'talked', 'hour', 'half', 'guess', 'had', 'fall', 'love', 'was', 'totally', 'mismatched', 'pair', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'when', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'main', 'focuses', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'should', 'be', 'only', 'job', 'ensuring', 'have', 'two', 'people', 'actually', 'build', 'chemistry', 'scene', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'did', 'not.Speaking', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'director', 'School', 'Rock', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'had', 'good', 'grasp', 'film', 'beginning', 'think', 'was', 'attempting', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'script', 'two', 'people', 'could', 'fall', 'love', 'chance', 'meeting', 'train', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'reactions', 'how', 'would', 'ultimately', 'end', 'Sorry', 'say', 'Linklater', 'poor', 'job', 'film', 'especially', 'ending', 'where', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'successful', 'climax', 'worst', 'part', 'film-it', 'keeps', 'going', 'going', 'really', 'welcome', 'too', 'repetitive', 'towards', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'helping', 'having', 'slow', 'ending.I', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'quote', 'film', 'greatest', 'love', 'story', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'differ', 'characterization', 'portrayal', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'were', 'uncomfortable', 'unstructured', 'fractured', 'parts', 'was', 'obvious', 'screen', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'love', 'stories', 'better', 'stories', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'released', 'Grade', '**', '*****']",N/A

101641,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,079073382X,Alistair McHarg,"[8, 27]","Richard (Artsy) Linklater, poet laureate of Gen-Nexters, is the kind of director who could be great - if he wasn't so lousy.  He has a refreshing desire to take risks, defy convention, and flat out ignore devices that have served storytellers for millennia.  In Tape he locked three people in a room and held them hostage, along with the audience.  In Waking Life he merged morphing animation with stream of conscious dialogue to create a dream within a dream within a college freshman's philosophy term paper.  In Before Sunrise he shows us a brief encounter, (characterized by the inappropriate illusion of intimacy frequently experienced when traveling), during which absolutely nothing happens.Failure is commonplace, failing magnificently requires courage.There are good things to say about Before Sunrise.  Vienna looks lovely.  Celine, Julie Delpy, looks equally lovely, and acts her part, what there is of it, beautifully.  The film is replete with attractive train and trolley shots and even re-uses the marvelous Ferris wheel made famous in The Third Man, (a movie that actually had a plot).  The Austrians on the bridge are funny, and the ""milkshake"" poem was wonderful.Things crash quickly after that.  Even the colorful street scenes, palm reader, belly dancing, etc. look blatantly staged, you can almost see the grips and gaffers stringing cables one foot out of the shots.  Ethan Hawke needs to be told that his scruff does not give him that cool, dangerous Trotsky affect; it just makes him look like he sleeps in a culvert.  Though his acting is workmanlike, he was the wrong choice for a film that depends entirely on the glossy superficiality and shared insanity of romance.When two people speak and listen to each other, that's called a conversation.  When interesting, well-developed characters talk to each other and do things to each other, thereby revealing themselves and being changed in the process, (and there's a cameraman on hand), that's called a movie.When two-dimensional characters talk endlessly about whatever in a way that accomplishes nothing and only serves to explore the full extent of their two-dimensionality, that's called a Richard Linklater movie.",2,Last Box Step In Vienna,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,2194,"['Richard', 'Artsy', 'Linklater', 'poet', 'laureate', 'Gen-Nexters', 'kind', 'director', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'lousy', 'refreshing', 'desire', 'take', 'risks', 'defy', 'convention', 'flat', 'out', 'ignore', 'devices', 'have', 'served', 'storytellers', 'millennia', 'Tape', 'locked', 'three', 'people', 'room', 'held', 'hostage', 'audience', 'Waking', 'Life', 'merged', 'morphing', 'animation', 'stream', 'conscious', 'dialogue', 'create', 'dream', 'dream', 'college', 'freshman', 'philosophy', 'term', 'paper', 'Sunrise', 'brief', 'encounter', 'characterized', 'inappropriate', 'illusion', 'intimacy', 'frequently', 'experienced', 'when', 'traveling', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'happens.Failure', 'commonplace', 'failing', 'magnificently', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'Before', 'Sunrise', 'Vienna', 'lovely', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'equally', 'lovely', 'part', 'what', 'beautifully', 'film', 'replete', 'attractive', 'train', 'trolley', 'shots', 'even', 'marvelous', 'Ferris', 'wheel', 'made', 'famous', 'Third', 'Man', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'plot', 'Austrians', 'bridge', 'are', 'funny', 'milkshake', 'poem', 'was', 'wonderful.Things', 'crash', 'quickly', 'Even', 'colorful', 'street', 'scenes', 'palm', 'reader', 'belly', 'dancing', 'etc', 'look', 'blatantly', 'staged', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'grips', 'gaffers', 'stringing', 'cables', 'one', 'foot', 'shots', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'be', 'told', 'scruff', 'not', 'give', 'cool', 'dangerous', 'Trotsky', 'affect', 'just', 'look', 'culvert', 'acting', 'workmanlike', 'was', 'wrong', 'choice', 'film', 'entirely', 'glossy', 'superficiality', 'shared', 'insanity', 'romance.When', 'two', 'people', 'speak', 'listen', 'other', 'called', 'conversation', 'When', 'interesting', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'talk', 'other', 'do', 'things', 'other', 'thereby', 'revealing', 'being', 'changed', 'process', 'cameraman', 'hand', 'called', 'movie.When', 'two-dimensional', 'characters', 'talk', 'endlessly', 'whatever', 'way', 'nothing', 'only', 'explore', 'full', 'extent', 'two-dimensionality', 'called', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'movie']",N/A

The dictionary defines a tryst as ""an arrangement for two people, usually lovers, to meet.""  Viewers of this movie will agree: the meeting of Julie Delpy's 'Celine' and Ethan Hawke's 'Jesse' is anything but arranged, and these these are could-be, wanna-be, not-quite-there-yet lovers.That aside, 'Sunrise' is highly skilled filmmaking, crammed full of  witty, intelligent dialogue which - in an impressive feat - comes out of the mouths of Delpy and Hawke sounding natural and unforced.  The standout scene (in my mind) is probably one in which Delpy says she ""needs to phone her friend in Paris"" and proceeds to engage an initially perplexed Hawke in a simulated conversation that reveals exactly how she feels about what's going on between the two of them.  Then, when the the roles are reversed, Delpy shows an ear for comedy with her characterization of Hawke's back-home buddy Frank, answering his call with a dead-on ""Yo, dude, what's up?""

I think the film killed the definition of ""conversation."" On the other hand, Before Sunrise is quite boring for my tastes, and that I rather watch Casablanca or Bonnie and Clyde over this crap. Ethan Hawke proudly displays some of the worst acting known to mankind. Even his character was all about sex, making it all the worse turning out as a pathetic liar when he purposefully mentions that sex wasn't what he was looking for. Julie Delpy also is too weak of an actress to get anything going on for the screen. I sense a very limited chemistry between the two. Actually, the film could have been redone with any other couples, and the results will probably be the same. Then, there are a very few select couples that would ignite into a fireball from kerosene at the outset: Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, and Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. There are some dialogues in Before Sunrise that make it hard for me to get by because they are so badly contrived.

101650,AMUTYOX234D90,079073382X,Bill,"[23, 25]","Can you think of another film and sequel that are as uniformly excellent? I sure can't. ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" are each jewels in their own right.I saw ""Before Sunrise"" when it came out in 1995 and fell head over heels. Some films become instant favorites but lose their luster after repeated viewings through the years -- it's natural for our response to change as we age and evolve. But with true movie classics, our affection only grows. ""Before Sunrise"" is one of those. It has remained among my favorite films these past nine years, and subsequent viewings have brought just as much, if not more, delight and wonder.Unfortunately, I've been less than thrilled with Richard Linklater's subsequent films -- particularly ""Waking Life,"" which I thought was pretentious and annoying (despite animated cameos by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy).So, I approached ""Before Sunset"" with both trepidation and excitement. Amazingly, the sequel is just as enjoyable and satisfying as the first. The tone is somewhat different, as you would expect because of the characters' greater maturity and share of disappointments. The performances, script and direction remain perfect.These are the most European American films I can think of, and yes, that's a compliment. (Sometimes, you almost expect to see subtitles.) They are particularly reminiscent of Eric Rohmer's films in that they rely on real-time effects and lengthy conversations to tap into what it means to be human and connect with others. And in fact, if you love the ""Before"" movies and you don't mind subtitles, you might want to also check out Rohmer films like ""Boyfriends and Girlfriends"" and ""Summer.""The ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" DVDs have excellent picture quality.

Yes, but despite, or because of this, it works. It works mainly because of the effortless youthful charm of the two lovers Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy and the intelligent and seemingly almost unscripted conversations between them. It rises above the merely mundane because of the masterly little touches by Director Richard Linklater, such as the constant references to time and the chiming of clocks, and to death and decay, or, at the very beggining of the movie, in which the pair only meet because Celine (Julie) moves into a different carriage due to the bitter arguing of a middle-aged and worn out couple.In fact this intellectual romance is pervaded throughout by a sense of melancholy and the capricious folly of existence. Set in Vienna, a city beautiful and romantic, yet which nonetheless retains the feel of being a living museum to a Europe once glorious and alive but now long dead and gone, there is something tragic and moving about these two lovers. At every moment they seem acutely and painfully conscious that they are playing out their roles against the incessant march of time, with an acceptance that sexual love is simply a cruel trick of nature, and yet who both nonetheless, seem so determined that for one day only, they can make something beautifully real and eternal between themselves.

Newman ""moodindigo2""","[6, 7]","Lately, Hollywood has been rehashing the sappy, neurotic comedy style for the Romance genre into the same film for each wave of young actors, upcoming and already situated as celebrities.  Meg Ryan has been overcast as the same, myopic lonely American woman, John Cusack equally branded with similar roles of the opposite gender.What Linklater did for Gen-X with his groundbreaking film Slackers, he's given to the genre of the Romantic comedy with the same integrity and off-beat style that marks his fortitude.  Linklater has come a long way from his stomping grounds in Texas.  For Before Sunrise, he's recruited Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy into roles that seem as if written for the actors, staking his claim upon the winding cobblestone streets of Vienna.The film is a venue of dialogue that is real, not pandering to emotions and melodrama.  Hawke and Delpy discuss life, love, philosophy, and death in a 14 hour window before a respective train to Paris and plane back to the U.S., possibly forever separating the two.  From this description, you would think this is a film of never ending chatter and neurotic bantering of the psyche and human nature.  Not at all.  Linklater creates an emotional connection between the couple that is sealed with kisses beneath an Austrian moon, tales of heartbreak, 1st crushes, discussions of human compulsion in cafes and a seedy bar.  The words that Hawke and Delpy speak are our own experiences, played out by two actors who seem to enjoy, if not relish their roles and dailogue that is a refreshing change from the cliches and stale bitching of so many other ""Romantic"" films.Before Sunrise has much more hidden in the shadows and alleys of Vienna.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 3]","Before Sunrise seemed like a European film by a European director, but it was actually the American Richard Linklater, the director of 1991's Slacker. I have seen one reviewer who said that Before Sunrise could therefore be called Shlakers. That seems a bit harsh, though, for a film this fresh and lovely. Filmed in Vienna, a very old and beautiful city, with plenty of long takes that allow the dialogue to unfold quite naturally, it tells a simple story of 2 young people who meet on a train. Ethan Hawke plays an American student, who goes by the name Jesse though his real name is James--and Julie Delpy is from Paris, like her character, Celine. Though the whole Ethan Hawke persona can sometimes wear on one's nerves, here he manages to be brash, but not impertinent. He is actually quite charming, and Julie Delpy is simply wonderful. They both act well with an extremely natural feel, like you are observing them on that train, and following them around Vienna. You can see that they are falling in love, but they have agreed that they won't pretend they'll ever see each other again. They will just have this one night together.They go so well together, you start to become concerned. Maybe they should get together. Maybe this was fate, this is their only chance at true love. The movie ends on an ambiguous note which I don't want to spoil, but if you want to know what happens to them there is a sequel called Before Sunset that takes up with Julie and Ethan's characters 9 years later.The film has numerous references to James Joyce's novel ""Ulysses"" and they both take place on June 16th, which is celebrated as ""Bloomsday"" named for main ""Ulysses"" character Leopold Bloom. Celine could be a literary allusion as well, to Louis-Ferdinand C&eacute;line, author of ""Death on the Installment Plan"" and ""Journey to the End of the Night."" Jesse quotes W.H. Auden at one point, and you wonder if he might become a writer himself some day. If he does, this chance encounter with Celine could no doubt provide some excellent material.-------------Celine: You know what I want?Jesse: What?Celine: To be kissed.Jesse: Well I can do that.===========A Scanner Darkly(2006) Directed by Richard LinklaterSchool of Rock (Widescreen Edition)(2003) Directed by Richard LinklaterDazed and Confused(1993) Directed by Richard LinklaterSlacker(1991) Directed by Richard LinklaterThe Hottest State(2006) Ethan Hawke was VinceSnow Falling on Cedars : Widescreen Edition(1999) Ethan Hawke was Ishmael ChambersGattaca(1997) Ethan Hawke was Vincent FreemanReality Bites(1994) Ethan Hawke was Troy DyerBroken Flowers(2005) Julie Delpy was SherryAn American Werewolf in Paris(1997) Julie Delpy was Serafine Pigot---------------------------Jesse: I feel like this is, uh, some dream world we're in, y'know.Celine: Yeah, it's so weird.

What I saw, rather, was one of the most inspiring and romantic movies I've ever seen. Linklater turns a clich&eacute;d premise into a lyrical and timeless piece of art. I don't think I've encountered such innocence and sublime simplicity before, perhaps with the exception of D.W. Griffith's TRUE HEART SUSIE (1919).The only other romances that personally inspired me were Frank Borzage's STREET ANGEL(1928) and HISTORY IS MADE AT NIGHT(1937). BEFORE SUNRISE lacks Borzage's Christian transcendence and soft-focus dexterity, but undeniably it belongs to the Pantheon of great romances. It is remarkable how a film can be so simple in premise and technique, and at the same time leave you unforgettable impressions.

In ""Slacker"", a young man wanders around Austin, encountering eccentric people who ruminate about life, love, death, philosophy and culture. In ""Dazed and Confused"", eccentric high schoolers cruise around Austin conversing about life, love, death, philosophy and culture (between tokes). In ""Waking Life"", a young man wanders around in a perpetually metaphysical dreamworld where he encounters eccentric people who ruminate about life, love, death, philosophy and culture. In ""Before Sunrise"", Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy wander around Vienna, encountering eccentric people while they ruminate about life, love, death, philosophy and culture (in between kisses). What you end up with in ""Before Sunrise"" is something akin to watching Noam Chomsky and Margaret Meade on a blind date (well, okay, much more attractive versions of Noam Chomsky and Margaret Meade!) Hawke and Delpy both ooze an easy charm that, taken together with the beautiful Vienna setting, makes the film a pleasant enough experience, but it ultimately may be a little too ""deep"" for its own good. At least Woody Allen senses when it is time to temper the intellectual observations with a ""quick yuk"" to keep the pretension factor reined in. That's why I can watch a romantic comedy like ""Manhattan"" again and again-because it stimulates my intellect but also keeps me entertained along the way; Allen does not forget to keep his audience engaged.

She moves away to be able to read, and sits by the young American and after a few looks of interest, they engage in conversation, producing a rather witty exchange that simply captures viewers.They soon are involved in candidly sharing ideas, intimate views on life, past experiences and little by little they are so fascinated that she decides to stop in Vienna and spend the night getting to know one another, for he must return to the USA the next day.Their 14 hour stop over in Vienna is great and as they walk the streets and ride the trains, we are witness to their relationship and we are enchanted to take part on what is a wonderful tour of this historic city.The director provides a rare view to two individuals that partake in a rather poignant discussion of rather deep subjects we all confront at one point or another.

It is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.",5,"""Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?""",1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,1501,"['Sweet', 'charming', 'funny', 'poignant', 'plotless', 'meaningful', 'Sunrise', '1995', 'third', 'movie', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'dedicated', 'everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'love', 'love', 'never', 'been', 'love', 'still', 'dreams', 'find', 'one', 'very', 'rare', 'movies', 'is/should/will', 'be', 'equally', 'interesting', 'teenagers', 'parents', 'even', 'grandparents', 'very', 'simple', 'little', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'visual', 'effects', 'car', 'chases', 'long', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Two', 'young', 'people', 'early', '20s', 'two', 'college', 'students', 'American', 'tourist', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'returning', 'home', 'summer', 'Europe', 'French', 'student', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'who', 'Paris', 'attend', 'classes', 'Sorbonne', 'meet', 'train', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'instantly', 'even', 'start', 'talking', 'hop', 'train', 'Vienna', 'where', 'walk', 'exploring', 'city', 'night', 'talk', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'boring', 'silly', 'instead', 'lovely', 'believable', 'clever', 'moving', 'romance', 'only', 'better', 'viewing', 'least', 'viewer', 'High', 'praise', 'sincere', 'gratitude', 'go', 'director', 'writers', 'delivering', 'two', 'charming', 'characters', 'superb', 'writing', 'always', 'interesting', 'witty', 'dialogs', 'two', 'awesome', 'performances', 'atmosphere', 'magic', 'falling', 'love', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'who', 'Botticelli', 'angel', 'great', 'portraying', 'smart', 'independent', 'incredibly', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman']",N/A

101693,A55RQ26WDPSM0,079073382X,Iusedtobeacat,"[3, 6]","I have a confession to make, I am a romantic not just a bit but a LOT. I can get carried away, especially with Love stories but Hollywood nowadays, not talking about the 80s or the 90s from (2000-20_) on started getting really clich&eacute;d especially when it comes to Romance movies. I don't usually watch Romance films because there isn't enough airing at the movie theater, I mean when was the last time you saw a ""truly romance"" film getting so hyped up ? ""Twilight"" doesn't count, nor does Romance Comedies. I think the last Romance film everyone was crazy about was probably ""Titanic"". So, anyway this movie ""Before Sunrise"" is a sweet/romantic story. There is no bad guys wanting to hurt anybody, there is no ex husbands or forbidden loves, there is no ""danger"" of any kind, no druggies, alcoholic or single working moms living in agony and depress or abusive husbands yada yada. Just a darn good movie, plain and simple.I'm not going to review the plot, since a lot of reviews has done that I'm sure. I'm just gonna say what I liked about this movie, in case you want or planning on seeing it.First of all, I really liked the scenery (for those who don't know) this movie takes place in Vienna, Austria and you get a very good view of the city, you know resturants, cafes, parks, the river, sight seeings that kind of stuff. I'm a travel freak, I really love to travel, see new places I've never traveled on a train but I want to and I always had a thing for Europe, I don't why maybe because I plan to live there someday so seeing all these shots of a European themed city was very cool ! I also liked the idea how in the end of the film they just kinda show us all the places the two characters went to, they say a photo can say a thousand words and I felt those quick recaps of the views really said a lot.Second of all, I really liked the characters Jesse and Celine. They were both likable and sweet. They also played perfectly together, I never felt like I was watching a movie rather like hearing someone's story. But Most importantly I think what made them charming for me is because they are ""Ordinary"" people, they are the kind that you can feel related to, the kind that you meet everyday. Like No supernatural powers or vampires or anything from that sort, just two very normal, very human people. I think most people can see themselves in Jesse or Celine.Most of all, I liked how this movie was romantic but the romance wasn't trying to overdo itself. I mean think about it, most romance movies there is dancing in the rain and things like that. Well, this movie wasn't from that sort, It felt real. I felt like I can relate to the story, I really felt like you know someone out there can be in a train traveling somewhere and meet someone, they start talking and spend some time together and really feel like they had a good time just being their selves. I felt like this could happen to anyone, even to me I can feel the same way about someone I meet one day. In other movies, when the hero/heroine have their first kiss it just feel so natural and so rehearsed, but when Jesse and Celine had their ""first"" kiss I really felt like it was their ""first"" I mean it felt so awkward.I would say this isn't your typical Hollywood romance movie or at least not the popular once. It isn't packed with sex and ""I Love You so much"" and ""I never wanna let you go"" kinda movie. It's mostly talk, just two people talking and sharing their thoughts about the world. It's mostly dialog, there isn't a ""save the day"" situation or anything like that. So, if your into talking, if you believe that someday you'll find that special someone or if you have just a little bit romantic in you. Give this movie a chance, I liked it but it really depends on your taste. If however, you feel like this kind of movies where two people talking, getting to know each other is boring and lame then I would advise against watching it but it never hurts if you gave it a chance...who knows ? you might like it.OK, now for all of you who'll get to end of the movie and think......??? Well, don't be so disappointed because there is a sequel to this movie called ""Before Sunset"" and it takes place nine years after the first.

For the first time I realized that I would be leaving part of my heart in Europe.  This movie is a love story that is true to itself.  Love is getting to know the other person.

I started watching it when there was nothing else to do and it quickly grew on me.  The characters are impulsive but believable.  The acting is crisp and straghtforward, and the entire experience was well worth the time I spent watching it.Two young people, an American man and a French woman, meet on the train and agree to get off together for one romantic night in Vienna.  Things seem to go their way as they make their way around town without speaking German.  They eventually fall in love and agree to meet in six months time at the train station where they depart.The viewer is caught up in the whirlwind romance that unfolds on the screen.  The couple appears carefree at first, but deeper emotions emerge as they realize their only night together may be the last time they see each other.  By the end of the movie the viewer is hoping that the director would fast forward six months to see if they do indeed return to their prearranged meeting spot.  The film does not do this but the hope remains.

This is the cerebral process of freely expressing ones initial thoughts without inhibitions or censorship to a listener, as it displays the ability of swiftly obtaining much information about a person.  Through the free association in the film, two individuals get to know one another through this seemingly diverging cerebral discussion regarding whatever crosses their mind.  However, through their openness these individuals find harmony, as they begin to connect the bits and pieces from each other's personal thoughts.The film opens with a German speaking couple, Austrians, or possibly Germans, arguing loudly on a train traveling westward.  Across the isle sits a young twenty-some blond French woman, Celine (Julie Delpy) who the audience will recognize from Three Colors: White (1994) from the year before, returning to Paris from a visit to her grandmother in Budapest.  The arguing couple urges her to move to a more peaceful location across from an American, Jesse (Ethan Hawke), of her own age.  Through blunt caution, Jesse approaches Celine, which leads both of them to the buffet car where they begin to discuss their personal philosophical perspectives on existence and their experiences.Through their discussion they found solace, but it is about to end, as Jesse must exit the train at Vienna due to a flight he had back to the United States the following day.  The two say their goodbyes, but Jesse quickly returns to ask Celine if she would consider staying for one night in order to eliminate the possibility of dreaming of him in the future.  Celine smiles and nods to Jesse's suggestion while she reveals that she intends to follow his notion.  Expectedly her decision leads the audience into an intriguing thoughtful venture where they discover one another through questions and hypotheses that they present to each other.The audience gets to follow Celine and Jesse through the night, as they get closer to each other through cerebral discovery.  The words that they exchange have a meaning, as they willfully expose themselves in order to gain each other's trust, care, and affection.  In essence, they are falling in love, and during this blissful night, they reveal their strengths, weaknesses, insecurities, and experiences through their viewpoints and notions.  This happens while they ultimately are aware that the culmination of their prolonged rendezvous is creeping nearer through the rise of the sun.The psychological depth and philosophical concentration of the story rests within Richard Linklater's and Kim Krizan's well-written script, which encourages cerebral participation and reflection.  However, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke enhance moments through their performances, which transcend words into human drama of the highest quality.  Linklater should also receive credit for framing each scene, which encourages the audience to dig deeper into the meaning of Celine and Jesse's conversations.  The end-credits do not stop this film from continuing to roll in the mind of the audience, as the love affair instigates the notion of why existence can be wonderful.",5,Affectionate Honesty Through Terrific Cerebral Venture...,1113004800,"04 9, 2005",2005,3193,"['Free-association', 'mind', 'viewing', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'film', 'Sunrise', 'cerebral', 'process', 'freely', 'expressing', 'ones', 'initial', 'thoughts', 'inhibitions', 'censorship', 'listener', 'ability', 'swiftly', 'obtaining', 'much', 'information', 'person', 'free', 'association', 'film', 'two', 'individuals', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'seemingly', 'diverging', 'cerebral', 'discussion', 'regarding', 'crosses', 'mind', 'However', 'openness', 'individuals', 'find', 'harmony', 'begin', 'connect', 'bits', 'pieces', 'other', 'personal', 'thoughts.The', 'film', 'German', 'speaking', 'couple', 'Austrians', 'possibly', 'Germans', 'arguing', 'loudly', 'train', 'traveling', 'westward', 'isle', 'young', 'twenty-some', 'blond', 'French', 'woman', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'who', 'audience', 'will', 'recognize', 'Three', 'Colors', 'White', '1994', 'year', 'returning', 'Paris', 'visit', 'grandmother', 'Budapest', 'arguing', 'couple', 'move', 'more', 'peaceful', 'location', 'American', 'Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'own', 'age', 'blunt', 'caution', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'buffet', 'car', 'where', 'begin', 'discuss', 'personal', 'philosophical', 'perspectives', 'existence', 'experiences.Through', 'discussion', 'found', 'solace', 'end', 'Jesse', 'must', 'exit', 'train', 'Vienna', 'due', 'flight', 'had', 'back', 'United', 'States', 'following', 'day', 'two', 'say', 'goodbyes', 'Jesse', 'quickly', 'ask', 'Celine', 'would', 'consider', 'staying', 'one', 'night', 'order', 'eliminate', 'possibility', 'dreaming', 'future', 'Celine', 'smiles', 'nods', 'Jesse', 'suggestion', 'follow', 'notion', 'Expectedly', 'decision', 'audience', 'intriguing', 'thoughtful', 'venture', 'where', 'discover', 'one', 'questions', 'hypotheses', 'present', 'other.The', 'audience', 'follow', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'night', 'get', 'closer', 'other', 'cerebral', 'discovery', 'words', 'exchange', 'have', 'meaning', 'willfully', 'expose', 'order', 'gain', 'other', 'trust', 'care', 'affection', 'essence', 'are', 'falling', 'love', 'blissful', 'night', 'reveal', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'insecurities', 'experiences', 'viewpoints', 'notions', 'ultimately', 'are', 'aware', 'culmination', 'prolonged', 'rendezvous', 'creeping', 'nearer', 'rise', 'sun.The', 'psychological', 'depth', 'philosophical', 'concentration', 'story', 'rests', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Kim', 'Krizan', 'well-written', 'script', 'cerebral', 'participation', 'reflection', 'However', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'enhance', 'moments', 'performances', 'transcend', 'words', 'human', 'drama', 'highest', 'quality', 'Linklater', 'should', 'also', 'receive', 'credit', 'framing', 'scene', 'audience', 'dig', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'conversations', 'end-credits', 'do', 'not', 'stop', 'film', 'continuing', 'roll', 'mind', 'audience', 'love', 'affair', 'notion', 'why', 'existence', 'can', 'be', 'wonderful']",N/A

Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[10, 11]","Sensitively directed by Richard Linklater (who was responsible for 1993s Dazed and Confused), it is essentially the tale of two people who meet as strangers and part as incredibly close friends only a few hours later - possibly to never meet again. But it offers so much more on closer inspection than that simple synopsis.Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meet on a train travelling between Vienna and Budapest. Both are in their early twenties and appear to be looking for something in their lives. Celine is French and heading back to Paris after visiting her grandmother. Jesse is an American and heading to Vienna to catch a cheap flight home to the States. The two meet quite by accident on the train, but soon strike up a conversation and instantly 'click'. They talk for some time before Jesse realises he must leave Celine when the train arrives in Vienna so he can catch his flight home. But he comes up with the crazy idea of asking her to join him when in Vienna, and just hang out in the city for the night. With his flight not scheduled to leave until next morning he wasn't planning on going to a hotel, but rather just wander the streets and take in the sights of the Austrian capital.Celine agrees and together they leave the train and explore the streets, meeting locals, buskers, beggars, and even a fortune teller, all in between telling their life story to each other and pondering all sorts of worldly and ethical questions about love, life, and death. The two effectively cram more living into the period between sunset and before sunrise than many people would hope to do in a year. As the time approaches when Jesse must leave for his flight, the two begin to realise that this could be a life defining moment, and the turmoil is clearly evident as both try to decide whether they should advance this relationship or leave it at this one-off meeting.When looking at the credits and realising that the character listed third is 'wife on train', you just know this whole film is going to be made or broken by the two lead actors. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke carry the roles off to perfection. Watch the unbridled excitement in their first kiss or glances at each other they steal when huddled in a record store listening booth and the reaction as they catch each other doing it.

Because this is a giant talk-fest and doesn't have syrupy and digusting melodrama that many Romance movies contain. If you're actually a smart viewer who knows a good Romance when they see one, check it out! Richard Linklater does't normally rely on plot with many of films. He focuses on the dialogue and emotions of the characters.Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is an American journalist who's just spending on a vacation with plans on visiting Madrid for personal reasons.  Celine (Julie Delpy) is a young French girl with a heart of gold. She's on her way to Paris and Jesse has a flight home tomorrow morning. After an awkward encounter on a train, they conversate until the train makes a stop. Jesse persuades Celine to get off with him that way they can get to know eachother and stroll all around the many different areas of Vienna.  They fall deeply for eachother and it never sinks into the Hollywood Romance cliches where within the next few scenes after the encounter, they decide to find a hotel and sleep with  ( I would put down a slang word for ""sex"" but I can't) eachother until they die. But that never happens. In a way, it's a bit sad considering they only have about 12 hours since they both have to leave the next day and may never see eachother again. It would be absolutely painful. You would understand if you ever fell for somebody for a short while and realize that somebody is forced to leave and they're long gone outta your life. Linklater has a very creative ear for dialogue. It seem so believable and Hawke and Delpy really nail the lines down. Jesse and Celine only have hours left. Will they ever reunite sooner or later? Will they end up moving on and forgetting eachtother?Does ""Before Sunrise"" have a plot? Well, not really, but there really is no need for one and it's pretty much Linklater's trademark. The dialogue and chemistry between Hawke and Delpy save it. Like I said before, if you're into the usual mainstream romantic films, just stay away! It's gonna bore you to tears. But for those who think differently and want an intelligent one, it's definitely worth checking out and maybe one of Linklater's best films.",5,Not your average Romance,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,2271,"['Hey', ""'re"", 'one', 'kinds', 'viewers', 'who', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'romantic', 'drama/comedy', 'steer', 'clear', 'one', 'giant', 'talk-fest', ""n't"", 'have', 'syrupy', 'digusting', 'melodrama', 'many', 'Romance', 'movies', 'contain', ""'re"", 'actually', 'smart', 'viewer', 'who', 'good', 'Romance', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'check', 'out', 'Richard', 'Linklater', ""does't"", 'normally', 'rely', 'plot', 'many', 'films', 'dialogue', 'emotions', 'characters.Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'American', 'journalist', 'who', 'just', 'spending', 'vacation', 'plans', 'visiting', 'Madrid', 'personal', 'reasons', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'young', 'French', 'girl', 'heart', 'gold', 'way', 'Paris', 'Jesse', 'flight', 'home', 'tomorrow', 'morning', 'awkward', 'encounter', 'train', 'conversate', 'train', 'stop', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'get', 'off', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'know', 'eachother', 'stroll', 'many', 'different', 'areas', 'Vienna', 'fall', 'deeply', 'eachother', 'never', 'Hollywood', 'Romance', 'cliches', 'where', 'next', 'few', 'scenes', 'encounter', 'decide', 'find', 'hotel', 'sleep', 'would', 'put', 'down', 'slang', 'word', 'sex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'eachother', 'die', 'never', 'way', 'bit', 'sad', 'considering', 'only', 'have', 'about', '12', 'hours', 'have', 'leave', 'next', 'day', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'eachother', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'absolutely', 'painful', 'would', 'understand', 'ever', 'fell', 'somebody', 'short', 'while', 'realize', 'somebody', 'forced', 'leave', ""'re"", 'long', 'gone', 'outta', 'life', 'Linklater', 'very', 'creative', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'seem', 'so', 'believable', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'really', 'lines', 'down', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'only', 'have', 'hours', 'left', 'ever', 'reunite', 'sooner', 'later', 'Will', 'end', 'up', 'moving', 'forgetting', 'eachtother', 'Sunrise', 'have', 'plot', 'Well', 'not', 'really', 'there', 'really', 'need', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'Linklater', 'trademark', 'dialogue', 'chemistry', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'save', 'said', ""'re"", 'usual', 'mainstream', 'romantic', 'films', 'just', 'stay', 'away', 'gon', 'bore', 'tears', 'who', 'think', 'differently', 'want', 'intelligent', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'maybe', 'one', 'Linklater', 'best', 'films']",N/A
101717,A2NJO6YE954DBH,079073382X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 10]","Viewers are going to consider ""Before Sunrise"" to be either refreshing or tedious.  On a train from Budapest to Vienna a German couple are having an argument that gets loud enough and uncomfortable enough that it forces Celine (Julie Delpy) to move to another part of the railroad car.  When the Germans continue their argument in the aisle and walk by, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) the young man now sitting across from Celine, leans over and asks the obvious question: What are those two fighting about?  Unfortunately Celine's German is not up to the task so we never know what exactly was the catalyst for what is to happen, but Celine and Jesse find other things to talk about.Jesse and Celine move their conversation to the diner car and keep on talking until they get to Vienna.  He has to get off to catch a plane the next morning, while she is heading on to Paris.  Then, on an impulse, he asks her to join him.  He does not have enough money for a hotel (which keeps this film from becoming predictable), and plans to stay up all night until it is time to go.  They can see what there is to see in Vienna at night as they enjoy each other's company and keep on talking.  However, the film refuses to become the predictable male fantasy, articulated by Celine, of an American boy meeting a French girl on a train, having sex with her, and then never seeing her again.  This road not usually taken may disappoint those who share such fantasies, but Hollywood has told that other story often enough for them go to the video store and find a similar tale that is rated R for more than language.I was not surprised that the script for ""Before Sunrise"" was written by a man, director Richard Linklater (""Slacker,"" ""Dazed and Confused), and a woman, actress and literature professor Kim Krizan (Master's thesis: ""Anais Nin and The Psychology of Creativity"").  What would surprise me if if the first drafts of this screenplay were not created using a tape recorder rather than a word processor as Linklater and Krizan worked out the dialogue by sitting around and talking it out.. Then again, I would not really have been surprised if Delpy and Hawke were making everything up as they go along, because there is also a sense in which ""Before Sunrise"" is Louie Malle's ""My Dinner With Andre"" with a better looking set of main characters and more locales.It is easy to think that ""Before Sunrise"" is a simple love story, a sort of post-modern version of the first half of ""An Affair to Remember,"" but the film is going for a different type of magic.  The moral to this particular romance is given by Celine, who tells Jesse: ""If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something. I know, it's almost impossible to succeed, but... who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.""",4,Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke talk the night away in Vienna,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,2836,"['Viewers', 'are', 'going', 'consider', 'Sunrise', 'be', 'either', 'refreshing', 'tedious', 'train', 'Budapest', 'Vienna', 'German', 'couple', 'are', 'having', 'argument', 'loud', 'enough', 'uncomfortable', 'enough', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'move', 'part', 'railroad', 'car', 'When', 'Germans', 'continue', 'argument', 'aisle', 'walk', 'Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'young', 'man', 'now', 'sitting', 'Celine', 'obvious', 'question', 'What', 'are', 'two', 'fighting', 'Unfortunately', 'Celine', 'German', 'not', 'up', 'task', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'catalyst', 'what', 'happen', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'find', 'other', 'things', 'talk', 'about.Jesse', 'Celine', 'move', 'conversation', 'diner', 'car', 'keep', 'talking', 'get', 'Vienna', 'get', 'off', 'catch', 'plane', 'next', 'morning', 'heading', 'Paris', 'Then', 'impulse', 'join', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'hotel', 'film', 'becoming', 'predictable', 'stay', 'up', 'night', 'time', 'go', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'see', 'Vienna', 'night', 'enjoy', 'other', 'company', 'keep', 'talking', 'However', 'film', 'become', 'predictable', 'male', 'fantasy', 'articulated', 'Celine', 'American', 'boy', 'meeting', 'French', 'girl', 'train', 'having', 'sex', 'then', 'never', 'seeing', 'again', 'road', 'not', 'usually', 'taken', 'may', 'disappoint', 'who', 'share', 'such', 'fantasies', 'Hollywood', 'told', 'other', 'story', 'often', 'enough', 'go', 'video', 'store', 'find', 'similar', 'tale', 'rated', 'R', 'more', 'language.I', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'script', 'Sunrise', 'was', 'written', 'man', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Slacker', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'woman', 'actress', 'literature', 'professor', 'Kim', 'Krizan', 'Master', 'thesis', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'Psychology', 'Creativity', 'What', 'would', 'surprise', 'first', 'drafts', 'screenplay', 'were', 'not', 'created', 'using', 'tape', 'recorder', 'rather', 'word', 'processor', 'Linklater', 'Krizan', 'worked', 'out', 'dialogue', 'sitting', 'around', 'talking', 'out..', 'Then', 'again', 'would', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'Delpy', 'Hawke', 'were', 'making', 'everything', 'up', 'go', 'along', 'also', 'sense', 'Sunrise', 'Louie', 'Malle', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'better', 'looking', 'set', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'locales.It', 'easy', 'think', 'Sunrise', 'simple', 'love', 'story', 'sort', 'post-modern', 'version', 'first', 'half', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'film', 'going', 'different', 'type', 'magic', 'moral', 'particular', 'romance', 'given', 'Celine', 'who', 'Jesse', 'kind', 'magic', 'world', 'must', 'be', 'attempt', 'understanding', 'someone', 'sharing', 'something', 'know', 'almost', 'impossible', 'succeed', 'who', 'really', 'answer', 'must', 'be', 'attempt']",N/A

While both are riding separately on a train in Austria, their paths cross, and they begin to chat. The chat leads into having conversation over a meal in the lounge car. As the train comes to a stop where Jesse is to get off, he's so captivated with Celine, he asks her to get off with him and just get to know each other more while in Vienna. As the night goes on, the attraction they have for each other begins to grow. But the inevitable is on the horizon as the sun begins to rise, and their one day of happiness begins to come to a close.`Before Sunrise' is truly one of the best romantic movies I think I have ever seen. It's not some sappy chick flick where some of the most absurd moments happen. It honestly feels real. Especially if you've ever fallen in love before. The first time meeting that special someone and how everything just clicks. How you can't get enough of each other and want to soak in everything they say and do like you're a thirsty dry sponge. The movie is littered with dialogue. It almost feels like a book on CD, but video...heh. But not once did I get bored. Sometimes their talking could go a little on and on, but in a way, isn't that how it is in real life sometimes? There have been many times where I would catch myself just babbling away at a story.  And while the movie is a romantic movie, it's still filled with some good laughs. So don't think it's just one big ""OH SMOOCH ME ALL NIGHT LONG"", because it isn't. When Jesse and Celine kiss, it was a little goofy the way it came about, but it was, you know, cute I guess (ugh). But later Celine kind of dogs on Jesse for trying to be all romantic to get that first kiss. It made me laugh. But seriously, I can't get over how the movie brought back memories of the first time I fell in love. The awkward meeting, the constant talking, never wanting to leave each others sides, the first kiss, the goofy romance, the sweet romance, and never once thinking about time. What a great movie. I can't believe I've owned this movie for about 3 years and never even gave it the time of day. Alphabetical reviewing wins again!If you love a good love story, own this. If you are looking for a good date movie, then definitely give this a rent. I think both guys and girls will like it. Well, I can see some guys out there rolling their eyes at it...hehe.P.S. - One of the biggest reasons why I never gave this a shot was because of the stupid cover. Looks like Ethan Hawke is choking Julie Delpy out! But then you realize its some goofy hair flip maneuver.

They get to talking and he convinces her to delay her trip, to get off the train with him in Vienna. He has very little money and was planning to just wander around the city all night, but now he has company. Naturally, before the night is over, they've fallen in love -- but not in the usual way. And when they finally part in the morning the viewer doesn't know whether they'll ever meet again or not. No sappy-happy ending here. The plot is very nicely done indeed. I don't care much one way or the other about Ethan Hawke, who plays Jesse, but Julie Delpy is perfect as Celine. She's ordinary-pretty this time out (as opposed to elegant or drop-dead gorgeous, which wouldn't work here) and sweet and very human. The chemistry between the two really works, as they stroll the streets, wander in and out of clubs, talk to a poet, listen to a harpsichord, ride the trams, and talk and talk and talk. They talk about everything under the sun, telling anecdotes from their lives to illustrate their semi-sophomoric philosophical debates. This is, in fact, the best sort of ""talky"" movie.

Second, I can't envy the boy who gets to have that girl fall in love with him.I fell in love with Julie Delpy.  Her Celine was doe-eyed and precious, moving effortlessly through the streets of Vienna like a water nymph.  And she was whip-smart to boot.  She was demure, shy, and hopelessly romantic.  And then in moments, shockingly blasphemous (her exclamation under the stars is the most apt use of the f-word I can think of).And Ethan Hawke is deserving of her affection.  Even though we've seen him play this kind of character before (unwashed, verbose, faux-beatnik), his Jesse is not the least bit annoying.  He is her equal in intellect, innocence, and world-weariness (a neat trick having all three in one package, no?).These two have a wonderful time in this movie.  From the first, electrically charged moments when they meet on the train, to their long walk-and-talks through the Viennese streets, to their inevitable parting, every moment was entertaining, alive, and true.  My favourite scene, sitting in a coffee-shop booth, had them play-acting the phone calls each would make to their best friends, telling the story of the person they met on the train.  It says much with very little, and for me is the moment that truly seals their relationship, because it manages to mix 1990's-style self-awareness with 1950's-style unabashed romanticism.There really is no story here.  They meet, they talk (great dialogue, by the way; feels improvised, but in a good way).  What gives the drama weight is that they (and the audience) know that they're obviously perfect for each other, yet will only have one night together.  It's a great setup that's executed perfectly.

101735,A1FG91CM8221X1,079073382X,Miles D. Moore,"[5, 6]","&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; is a small film but a charming and rewarding one. Celine, a young Frenchwoman, and Jesse, a young American, meet on the train from Budapest to Vienna. Jesse has 14 hours before he must board his plane back to America; he persuades Celine to spend that time with him wandering around Vienna; they spend the time talking, meeting various eccentric Viennese, and falling in love. In the morning they part, probably never to see each other again, although they vow that they will. That's all there is to it, but it's delightful, thanks to Richard Linklater's savvy writing and direction and the sweet performances of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. The dialogue captures perfectly the thoughts and personalities of two intelligent, thoughtful but not-quite-mature young people, and Linklater's camera takes us on a panoramic tour of Vienna (including several sites immortalized by an earlier, much darker film set in Vienna, &quot;The Third Man&quot;). What is most affecting about Before Sunrise, however, is the poignancy and urgency it gains as Celine and Jesse's time together comes to its inevitable end. Jesse's quotation from W.H.

But this is a thoughftul and compelling movie that broke down my skeptical and cynical wall. First, the movie takes us through the awkward stages of two people going from being perfect strangers to removing their own walls and falling in love in a way that is never sappy. Using this falling-in-love motif, the director/writer Richard Linklater addresses several profound themes: the nature of time, the conflict between cynicism and romance, the obsession with death, the shortcomings of &quot;adulthood.&quot; The dialogue between Hawke and Delpy is philosophical but never too abstract; it seems to stem from their well-drawn characters. I suppose there's a parallel between the breaking down of my own cynicism and the characters'. They have been hurt by life, have put up their walls, and, through their discussions, they have gradually removed those walls so that by the movie's end you think it's a crime if they don't fall in love and live happily ever after. But the movie is more complex than a happy ending. The movie forces you to ask if their love would survive if removed from the brief ecstasy of their single day (and night) together. Is the brevity the cause of their ecstasy? Would a life of marriage disintigrate into the mundane?

And it's done pretty simply in this incredibly affecting and joyous celebration of young love; but simple, in this case, is a pathway to greatness. Simple, in this case, means intense, focused, and rapturous.Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) are on a train, sitting in the same car a few rows apart. Celine is reading book in French and Ethan an English-language one; they each gaze out at the passing countryside occasionally. A couple near Celine start arguing loudly in German; she moves and sits down near Jesse. A halting conversation starts up but quickly becomes comfortable as Jesse learns that Celine's English is near-perfect, and that each is alone. They have dinner in the dining car and engage in small talk and learn a little about each other: Celine is on her way back from Budapest to Paris where she's going to school; Jesse is on his way to Vienna to fly back to the USA after bumming around the continent for a couple of weeks. They both seem by turns shy and aggressive...the train pulls in to the Vienna station, and Jesse impulsively asks Celine to get off with him and spend the evening wandering around the city, as he doesn't have the money for a hotel room. After a little hesitation, she accepts.I don't know if Linklater or his lead actors/co-writers Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were familiar with Jacques Rivette's 1974 CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING or not; I suspect that the director at least was. Like Rivette's film (the first half hour in particular), this is about two people wandering around a big and beautiful city, getting to know each other, and going off in unexpected directions, and like the earlier film this was co-written by the cast and heavily improvised. The obvious similarities pretty much end there - Rivette's film develops into a relatively humorous and fanciful murder-mystery, its two female leads never developing a romantic relationship; BEFORE SUNRISE is a quite serious (though never ""heavy"") romance and the male/female dynamic is always in play. But the two also have in common a love of the city and of exploration, a sense of the city as adult playground that is surprisingly not all that common in cinema - at least not in our suburban world today.I don't mean to suggest that this film is burdened with heavy European art-film tropes or that it is lacking in originality - far from it in fact. For a film with such a simple storyline and some obvious points of reference both French and American (think several Judy Garland romances from the 40s in particular) this is anything but clich&eacute;d or dry; the growing joy of our two leads is palpable and their explorations all both real and ordinary ( watching street performers, eating and drinking in old cavernous bars and beautiful outdoor caf&eacute;s, a palm reading, street performers, a walk through a cemetery) and fresh because of the commitment that Delpy and Hawke bring to playing characters that are certainly reflective of themselves. Celine is the relatively mature and articulate, politically minded intellectual - Jesse the slightly more posturing and juvenile proto-philosopher whose ideas usually seem more scattered, but also perhaps the more original thinker. At various points each of them takes the initiative, carrying the budding romance forward; at various points each one retreats a little, though overall it seems that Jesse is (slightly) more pushy. There are certainly commentaries about the differences between Europe and America here, but only once does it seem over-the-top (a bar scene where an American couple rudely complain to each other about the service); generally this is a film about what we have in common, not what drives us apart.After the long and wonderful night, it's time for parting. Celine gets back on a train home; Jesse prepares to board his flight. They've made a connection, beyond a one night stand...they vacillate over whether to keep in contact, finally deciding on a scheme that comes straight out of AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER and the childish romantic fantasies we've all had: in six months they'll meet again, at the same time, the same train station. You'll have to watch the equally wonderful Before Sunset to find out how that turns out.If there's a more feeling and wise film about two people meeting and falling in love, I'd like to see it. I've seen this three times and it's only improved on each viewing. As I said above, it's not ""heavy"", it's never overly philosophical or artsy, but it's not stupid either - and given the state of American romantic comedy at the time (and since), that would be complement enough; but there's also just enough fantasy and whimsicality here (how is it that the two are so often totally alone and able to indulge in deep, uninterrupted conversations in well-lighted alleys, never disturbed; would the barman really give Jesse a bottle of wine on a promise of later payment, etc) to enliven the situations without taking away from their central truth. We can see plenty of differences between Celine and Jesse developing, but also enough commonalities and real attraction that we really wonder, and want to know, what's next between them. Not many Hollywood romantic comedies leave me wanting more (in a good way); this certainly did. For once, I'm glad there's a sequel.",5,Celine and Jesse Go Romancing,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,5348,"['simplest', 'movie', 'stories', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'done', 'pretty', 'simply',

I was right.I rented this movie and thought the movie was charming, funny, poigniant, and very realistic.Ethan Hawke ( a very underrated actor - please make more movies!!!) and Julie Delpy (where has she gone?) meet on a train going to Vienna.  On a whim, both decide to spend the day and night together.This is not an action movie!  There is dialogue - people talk and you get to know them as they get to know each other.  Both actors do an excellent job of acting.  The nervousness, the anticipation - it is all there.  The audience ( and the charecters)  know what is going to happen - but the fun is the conversations these people have  in getting there.  Meaningless, stupid, funny, interesting; the converstations are interesting because both people know they likely won't see each other again - so they can confide in each other.The scenery is great.  Having been to Vienna, the sights are wonderful.  I even went to many of the same places as the charecters.  The fountain they sit at is above the Vienna State Opera House.  At the end of the movie, you will see a line of people - those people are waiting for standing-room only tickets for the opera!!  It made me remember my time in Vienna. I waited in that line to see the opera.I must confess I met a girl on a train as well in Europe - and this movie brought the same memories of that time.  The movie is romantic, and cool because the guy lives out a fantasy thing for traveling in Europe.  Oo la lah. (I didn't get so lucky! : ()This is a charming movie, and well worth seeing.  It is so sad at the end ( I won't ruin the resolution), but the writer/director R. Linklater handles the ending with such beauty and subtle touch that it makes the movie even more 'true.'This is truly bravura filmmaking.  No, it isn't ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" but in my opinion, it is similarly quality filmmaking.  This movie is like ""My Dinner with Andre.""  There is simply something about it that makes your heart sing.  Yeah, just from two people being together. No sex, no drugs, no rock and roll, just simply human communication.  Simply exquisite.

Strange as it may sound, I had never watched the very first movie in this series, so finally I gave in and saw this.""Before Sunrise"" (1995 release;  101 min.) brings the story of how Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke) and Celine (played by Julie Delpy) meet (on a train to Vienna). The only leap of faith I felt I had to make is that within minutes of starting to talk to each other on the train, Jesse invites Celine for a bite to eat in the train's lounge car, and she accepts, even though at that point he is a complete stranger. But after that it plays out exactly as you would expect it. As in the other two movies, it is basically just those two characters talking and talking, and talking some more. If you are expecting anything else (as apparently some of the reviewers who rated this movie 1 star), please save your time and money and do not watch this. But if you like a talk-movie, this is about as good as it ever gets. The standout scene of this movie is towards the end of the movie, when Celine and Jesse make pretend phone calls to their respective friends and talk/confess about having met someone. Just sublime.Equally interesting is to see how Jesse and Celine have evolved as characters in the subsequent movies (and how Hawke and Delpy have evolved as actors in these roles). The contrast between ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Midnight"" is stark on many levels, as it should be, given that 18 years has passed. And not always pretty. But it makes for fascinating viewing.

101758,A13DQTXG02HZC1,079073382X,Ping Lim,"[2, 2]","I watched this movie because I watched the sequel that's made nine years after ""Before Sunrise"" was made.  Despite its age, ""Before Sunrise"" is still as relevant as ever, talking about love.  How quaint that two strangers met on a train would transcend cultures, customs, languages and find a connection in one day.  Love is truly a strange but wonderful thing.  It's not the quantity of days that you love someone or someone loving you back but the quality of love that you transmit and reciprocate back from the other person.  Love ain't acting lovey dovey to one another but the sensation of loving someone and being loved back.  In this movie, we can feel it.  The chemistry, the longing, the desire are all there.  That makes it even more unbearable to continue watching when we know that when the sun rises the next day, they would go their separate ways.  Yet, we are compelled to continue watching because we yearn for them to stick together just as any Hollywood movies would, offering gullible audience those cliche ending of living happily ever after.  Real life is more complicated than that, lovers love one another and yet, they end up with other persons but does that mean that love would cease to exist there and then?  Would it be right for the persons who don't end up with their loved ones to continue loving the persons that they wish they would end up with?  Would that be a sense of betrayal to the present partners that the lovers end up being together with?  If lovers truly meant for one another, wouldn't they just give up everything for the sake of love or being rational adults, they need to do what is deemed right?  What is right and true anyhow?  Ultimately, ""Before Sunrise"" and its sequel raises questions about love and as the end credit rolls, we would ponder upon this question for the longest time yet.  A movie or movies that are worth watching to remind us about the virtue of love.  Love is such a transient entity and yet, it lasts longer than the Roman Empire and even Christ Himself.  No extra features on DVD but a definite collectible.  A movie that you would revisit again and again.

I guess that it appeals to the side of them that wants to get the girl of their dreams, and the movie acts like a primer that is fail safe.  I can't think of a ""gentleman"" who would not want to have a night like that at least once in his life.  Younger men, especially, need preparation in taking on romance, as romance is not particularly comfortable territory for males.  However, if a man can find a woman he loves, this love will rival the Super Bowl, World Cup, moto cross, or any intriguing gadget.Appeal to the psyche of men is a major key in the success of this film.  Of course, many feminine minds relate instantly to Julie Delpy's character, that is predictable and standard, but only a man's man type will be able to relate to Jesse, Ethan Hawke's character  (the type being a guy who fits into the masculine spectrum somewhere).  To me, a man's man is Clark Gable, John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, any James Bond and, lately, Tyler Perry.  I imagine these screen idols being like Ethan Hawke's character.  Regular guys, like me, want to be like these guys.  We want to live life to the fullest.  And sometimes, really, the best things in life are free.  I never will be too old to learn something new about living well.If you try to over analyze or receive some great psychological awakening from this film, you will be bored and disappointed.  Moreover, this film is strictly from an American male's perspective.  And we know how American men are perceived abroad.  But if you want to receive insight in how to spontaneously connect with your soul mate, you will be rewarded with basic tools that may allow you to exist until that moment presents itself, to recognize the moment, and to ""seize the day.""

DelParto ""Rose2""","[4, 5]","All within 24 hours, Richard Linklater captures the conversation between two traveling companions on a train and through the historic and bohemian cityscape of Vienna.  Ethan Hawke (Jesse) and Julie Delpy (Celine) play the two romantics as they stroll down the streets of Vienna as they find out about themselves as well as of each other.  BEFORE SUNRISE is one of those films about self-actualizing and self-discovery.  Yes, there is a lot of talk and less action, but it is a simple film with an exchange in ideas and philosophizing from each of the actors, which makes the film so entrancing.  The film has a Woody Allen (""Annie Hall"") and Rob Reiner (""When Harry met Sally"") feel to it, but without too much angst and whining.The characters in BEFORE SUNRISE are the most interesting aspect of the film.  One may consider these two individuals as complete opposites, Jesse, a drifter who takes a European trek, Celine, a French graduate student visiting a relative.  Although that may be the case, it is the dialogue that they engage in, which is absolutely timeless.  Jessse appears to be the pragmatic and skeptic type, while Celine appears to be the hopeful and optimistic type who is open to outside influence.  For the most part, the content of the film is universal, the connection that is made between two people regardless of what geographical region they come from.  The characters make reference to each of their respective countries, U.S. and France, and their cultures as well social quirks that have left an impression on their lives.Linklater's direction and Kim Krizan's screenplay gives BEFORE SUNRISE a natural look.  The handheld camera method as well as the quick cuts and long shots, such as when Jesse and Celine stand inside a listening room as the needle drops playing Kate Bloom's ""Come Here,"" is effective.  In addition, the actual setting, Vienna, the initial backdrop of the film is captured, which romanticizes the image that Europe is the place where the young seek refuge before their rite of passage - taking a trek after college or study abroad, etc.BEFORE SUNRISE is a film that may take several viewings to get into.  It is not for the viewer that cannot sit still and listen to.

From the moment American Jesse meets the luminous French Celine there is a soul connection that defies definition.At first, Celine seems to overwhelm Jesse with her intellectual wanderings and yet she playfully allows him to tease her. The chemistry is phenomenal and the sheer beauty of various scenes made me realize how the simplicity of the settings actually enhanced the emotional aspects.Throughout the entire movie you never feel that you are on the outside looking in, although I think that is the underlying attraction. I was so mesmerized by the script I felt I became each character as they were speaking. This is bliss for anyone who loves the sheer honesty of life itself. Jesse and Celine delve into philosophy, creatively describe their first romantic feelings and enjoy a spontaneous merging of the minds.When they meet on a train heading to Vienna, neither imagine they will encounter a reality that is better than any fantasy. There is a sweet innocence pervading this entire movie with an underlying erotic tension that never seems to find complete fulfillment on screen.

101771,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,079073382X,Robert J. Crawford,"[8, 8]","This film took me back to my own youth, a big chunk of which was spent wandering around Europe seeking that special someone and trying to put together a career that made sense.  In that setting, chance encounters with extraordinary people were rare but possible, when I met someone who lifted the veil of young lonliness in amazing conversation and unique moments that stand out in my memory like gems.  So I find the experience of the protagonists realistic and downright lovely - they are young, their whole lives are ahead of them so all they can see are possibilities and their ideals, and lukcy them, they are beautiful.The acting, much of which must have been adlibing, is utterly superb.  As yet, these two characters do not reflect any special talents and are not unrealistically insightful or perfectly desirable.  Indeed, the boy is rather callow and from a broken home, while the girl is perhaps neurotically angry.  They are just very real, full of need the way the young often feel, and wondering if they can do something that surpasses their backgrounds.I loved the way that they were drawn together, just this sudden rapport that allowed them to talk, to touch, to open to the delicious mystery of intimacy.  It reminds me of the first time I went out with my wife:  we talked and talked and talked and by the end of the day I felt like we might talk for the rest of our lives.  We met by chance on a train in Japan and a year later were married.  This film shows such a similar thing.It is also very subtle, with plenty of themes implied but not fully elaborated on.  This is so nice in an era of crass films, where everything is unambiguous and stupidly explicit.  You don't even know if they consummated anything.Warmly recommended.

101773,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,079073382X,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[0, 0]","This was a beautiful movie, a wonderfully understated story of an extended date between 2 strangers: an awkward and goateed American slacker (Ethan Hawke) and a stunning and sunny French woman (Julie Delpy). Jesse (he), is on the rebound - having followed his girlfriend to Europe, only to find that she's dumped him.  On a train to Vienna, he meets Celine (she, natch).  The two hit it off in a sort of cute way, and Celine agrees to keep Jesse company in Vienna overnight, as he wiles the hours away until morning for his flight back to the US.  They spend most of the time ambling through Vienna - through its old streets, along the Danube and the even check out that Ferris Wheel from ""The Third Man"" (Harry Lime does not make an appearance, and neither of our heroes brave the Viennese sewers).  ""Before"" may be a scripted follow-up to Linklater's earlier ""Slacker"" - substituting Austin, TX with Vienna.  Though the flick boils down to an extended conversation, Delpy and Hawke develop a tender chemistry that goes beyond the abstract philosophy of their conversation (Jesse muses that rich and poor children are similarly neglected; Celine muses that some people easily and unwittingly give their lives up to work, never thinking of their own enjoyment).  The plot never builds up any tension - any sense that their relationship is heading for something, but that's the point.  By the time they part ways, we realize that both of our heroes struggled to be as open and friendly as possible with a total stranger each knows will never be seen again.  The pay-off comes at the end as we say the pain of their separation.  In a montage of Vienna the next morning, as the camera lingers on those spots graced by Jesse and Celine - now washed by sunshine but bereft of their company (or anybody else's).  The loss is palpable.  If anything, ""Before"" may be a companion to ""Movable Feast"", Hemingway's ode to pre-WWII Paris.  Unlike Paris, Linklater seems to be saying, Vienna is delicacy that you can't take with you.  So stick around as long as you can, and savor every bite.

So finally, with my reading and work caught up (and a Netflix trial), I finally rented it, only to fall in love with a romance that was utterly charming, unassuming, organic, and totally real; I was swept into the tiny alleys of Vienna along with the film's protagonists. At first, the plot seems pedestrian enough: aloof French beauty and moody American tourist stuck on train meet, hit it off, and spend the night together. But the depth of the dialogue (the basis of the whole film), the very natural acting, and the onscreen chemistry of two soulmates, along with the beautiful cinematography of Europe, made this a gem.Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is running away from a failed relationship, due to board a plane to the U.S. the next morning. C&eacute;line, a headstrong Parisian, is a writer and passionate feminist on her way home from visiting her grandmother in Budapest. The two are thrown together after escaping an ugly confrontation by a married German-speaking couple, and C&eacute;line is quickly drawn in by Jesse's stories and quirky sense of humor. He convinces her to get off the train at Vienna and spend the day with him, since he doesn't have money for a hotel. The two let the city lead them where it will, and Wien (Vienna) shows her charms in unexpected ways: graceful palaces, amusement parks, local dives, palm readers, vagabond poets, monasteries, cemeteries, churches and sidewalk cafes.The pacing is leisurely to say the least. C&eacute;line and Jesse candidly engage on conversations covering every topic imaginable, from what love means to each of them (a touchy subject), cultural stereotypes, reincarnation, death, pretend phone conversations on what attracted them to each other, and bashful first kisses. Their growing attraction is shown in tender moments: the two staring at each other and looking away while listening to a record in a booth, Jesse's hand reaching out to brush C&eacute;line's curls, but quickly drawing away, a kiss shared in a Ferris wheel at sunset.This is a beautiful romance that feels totally real: no Hollywood stereotypes, only honesty, pain, and tenderness. I can't imagine how hard it must have been to make the dialogue so organic - this almost feels like a documentary, as if someone was following them and filming their blossoming romance.Ten years later, Richard Linklater released the sequel, ""Before Sunset,"" in which Jesse and C&eacute;line are reunited in Paris. I haven't seen it yet, but if it is even a fraction as magical as ""Before Sunrise,"" I can't wait to see what the future holds in store for Jesse and C&eacute;line.The film is rated R for language (profanity).",5,"A charming reflection on romance, fate, and life's little quirks",1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,2709,"['filmophile', 'friend', 'mine', 'kept', 'encouraging', 'rent', 'Sunrise', 'So', 'finally', 'reading', 'work', 'caught', 'up', 'Netflix', 'trial', 'finally', 'rented', 'only', 'fall', 'love', 'romance', 'was', 'utterly', 'charming', 'unassuming', 'organic', 'totally', 'real', 'was', 'swept', 'tiny', 'alleys', 'Vienna', 'film', 'protagonists', 'first', 'plot', 'pedestrian', 'enough', 'aloof', 'French', 'beauty', 'moody', 'American', 'tourist', 'stuck', 'train', 'meet', 'hit', 'off', 'spend', 'night', 'together', 'depth', 'dialogue', 'basis', 'whole', 'film', 'very', 'natural', 'acting', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'two', 'soulmates', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Europe', 'made', 'gem.Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'running', 'away', 'failed', 'relationship', 'due', 'board', 'plane', 'U.S.', 'next', 'morning', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'headstrong', 'Parisian', 'writer', 'passionate', 'feminist', 'way', 'home', 'visiting', 'grandmother', 'Budapest', 'two', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'escaping', 'ugly', 'confrontation', 'married', 'German-speaking', 'couple', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'quickly', 'drawn', 'Jesse', 'stories', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'get', 'off', 'train', 'Vienna', 'spend', 'day', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'hotel', 'two', 'let', 'city', 'lead', 'where', 'will', 'Wien', 'Vienna', 'charms', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'graceful', 'palaces', 'amusement', 'parks', 'local', 'dives', 'palm', 'readers', 'vagabond', 'poets', 'monasteries', 'cemeteries', 'churches', 'sidewalk', 'cafes.The', 'pacing', 'leisurely', 'say', 'least', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'Jesse', 'candidly', 'engage', 'conversations', 'covering', 'topic', 'imaginable', 'what', 'love', 'touchy', 'subject', 'cultural', 'stereotypes', 'reincarnation', 'death', 'pretend', 'phone', 'conversations', 'attracted', 'other', 'bashful', 'first', 'kisses', 'growing', 'attraction', 'shown', 'tender', 'moments', 'two', 'staring', 'other', 'looking', 'away', 'listening', 'record', 'booth', 'Jesse', 'hand', 'reaching', 'out', 'brush', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'curls', 'quickly', 'drawing', 'away', 'kiss', 'shared', 'Ferris', 'wheel', 'sunset.This', 'beautiful', 'romance', 'totally', 'real', 'Hollywood', 'stereotypes', 'only', 'honesty', 'pain', 'tenderness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'hard', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'dialogue', 'so', 'organic', 'almost', 'feels', 'documentary', 'someone', 'was', 'following', 'filming', 'blossoming', 'romance.Ten', 'years', 'later', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'released', 'sequel', 'Sunset', 'Jesse', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'are', 'reunited', 'Paris', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'even', 'fraction', 'as', 'magical', 'Sunrise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'future', 'store', 'Jesse', 'C', 'eacute', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'profanity']",N/A

101777,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,079073382X,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 4]","Richard Linklater has got an ear for real-world dialogue.  His characters don't speak in a hyper-cool, overly-stylized dialect that tangentially (if entertainingly) related to English, like the cons of ""The Usual Suspects"" or any of Quentin Tarantino's characters.  Nope.  Linklater's characters engage in ordinary, yet intelligent banter that makes them almost unnervingly familiar.  And invariably endearing.In his earlier movie, ""Dazed and Confused,"" Linklater followed around a bunch of high school students on the last day (and night) of school back in the 1970s.  Through a huge cast and an antiplot that careened from character to character linked virtaully only by their conversations, Linklater created the delightful sense that the audience was going back in time to their own high school years and seeing old friends.In ""Before Sunrise,"" the plot is not nearly as universal as ""the last night of the school year.""  Ethan Hawke is Jesse, a slacker-ish American riding the Eurorail to Vienna.  Julie Delpy is Celine, a young French woman heading to school at the Sorbonne.  United by a distaste for overbearing Germans on the train, they strike up a conversation that lasts for the next 14 hours.  When the train stops in Vienna, Jesse convinces Celine to help him spend time in Vienna before his flight to the States the next morning.  Intrigued by both the man and the offer, Celine agrees.What follows is an extended dialogue that belongs right up there with the great screenplays for romantic comedies, including ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Shakespeare in Love.""  Wandering from locale to locale, Jesse and Celine bump into numerous colorful Viennese characters.  But the focus of the movie remains firmly on their conversations with each other as they explore their mutual hopes, dreams, fears and desires, all spiced with that wonderful special something that inhabits every conversation when you know you're talking to Miss Right (or Mr., as the case may be).Hawke and Delpy give virtuoso performances in this movie, as their deliveries and silences perfectly capture the dance of awkwardness, delight, and surprise as they continually discover each other.  Similar characters, yet distinct, they have much in common and also have many unique traits.  Given distinct yet intelligent voices, Jesse and Celine are as fascinating at the closing scenes as they were at the outset -- which is an achievement, considering how much talking has been going on.Vienna and its sundry haunts play a vital role in the movie, as the melancholy beauty of this old city provides the perfect backdrop for a relationship that may or may not only last 14 hours.All in all, ""Before Sunrise"" may be one of those rare movies that is better enjoyed at home than in a theater.  Very few ""laugh-out-loud"" moments, numerous long stretches of conversation, and several meaningful silences make ""Before Sunrise"" an excellent movie to enjoy on the couch by yourself or with a loved one, for there is much to think about.  I have rarely cared as much for two characters in a movie as I did for Celine and Jesse . . . the end of the movie leaves one anxious to learn more about both.

The basic structure of the movie, which several other reviewers have complained about, did not ""bore"" me or disappoint me. The movie is essentially about two people having a long conversation one night after meeting on a train.The problem for me was the content of the conversation. I've read that a fair portion of the dialog was improvised and perhaps that was part of the problem. The content of the conversation seems to be the inexperienced and shallow observations of two twenty-somethings who are fairly cynical. What some people feel was ""wit"", I felt was cliched and trite. For instance, at one point, Ethan Hawke's character says that he feels married people who are happy lie to one another all the time. If we knew more about his character's past up to this point and could see that there was some negative experience behind his cynicism, the statement might offer us a chance to empathize with and understand his character. Given the lack of information about his motives for such a statement and his age, I can only see him as another Hollywood character making flip comments about marriage in an attempt to show how much smarter they are about the true state of things than the rest of the world.It wasn't merely this one statement that was a problem. The dialogue in general is not very well-paced or interesting. The characters, because they are so smug in their assertions, are not very likeable. Also, there seems to be very little on-screen chemistry between Delpy and Hawke. I couldn't buy that these two people were irresistably drawn to each other. I particularly couldn't buy Delpy spending a day with a stranger who was often brash, rude and dismissive of her behavior.Perhaps this concept would have worked better with two actors with a genuine rapport and physical connection.

Most of all they allow the viewer to determine the outcome.  These two separate meetings have had more influence on the lives of Jesse and Celine than any other event in their lives, with the possible exception of the death of Celine's grandmother.  Had Celine's grandmother not died the two may have been reunited and attempted to live out their one romantic night into a lifetime affair.The question is will these two survive if they have the chance to let their love grow, or will their passion burn out and extinguish all that they remember from that night in Vienna, and that evening in Paris.  While Sunset is far less concerned with passion and more devoted to the idea of memory it is perhaps the more moving of the two films.  After Sunrise you could easily blow off the night they had as two people that didn't really know each other connecting on some level because the possibility of meeting again was so slim.  Sunset has them meet again, without the passion, or the sexual drive, but with the pshyes of two adults trying to understand why they can't get over that one night when they were essentially still kids.As they meet again, and talk again, they fit neatly with one another, even though talk is a bit uncomfortable at first, and the weight of the situation bears down on them.  They realize that they are two people that will never be satisfied elsewhere if they haven't given each other a try in a realistic setting.The song that Celine sings to Jesse is beautiful, romantic and heartbreaking, and the actors are impeccable both in the acting and the writing of their parts, and the result is the perfect follow up the defining film on young passionate love.

It is intelligent, mature, honest, and realistic in its depiction of relationships between men and women.Much of the film's success is due to its simple but fruitful premise.  Ethan Hawke plays a young American traveling in Europe who meets a young French woman on a train, played by Julie Delpy.  They sit and talk and soon realize that they both genuinely enjoy the other's company.  When Hawke's character reaches Vienna where he must catch a flight that night, he convinces Delpy's character to spend the rest of the day with him.Because they are strangers and because they will probably never see each other again after this day, their conversation is extremely candid, especially when it comes to their views about relationships.  They are able to be objective, even as they are falling in love - something that is rarely achieved in reality.I think we owe Richard Linklater a debt of gratitude for making this movie.

101796,A2YKADCJME4FSW,079073382X,Tom Birkenstock,"[1, 2]","Richard Linklater is the master of the conversation film.  From his first movie, Slacker, to his more recent creation, Bernie, he has always relied on dialogue to carry his narrative.  For some this is a weakness.  Film is a visual medium, after all.  Linklater's films may not be as visually striking as other auteurs, but in subduing the visual element, he has refocused his narratives on the intimate, often mundane conversations that take place between his characters.  Nowhere in his filmography is this more apparent than Before Sunrise, a romantic film about two couples who meet in Vienna, strike up a half a day's worth of a relationship, and, of course, madly fall in love.The two protagonists of Before Sunrise, Celine and Jessie, first meet on a train as it's pulling into Vienna.  Celine has switched seats to get out of earshot of a bickering couple, and the two strike up a conversation that's unnaturally cut short because Jessie is flying out of Europe tomorrow and Celine is supposed to continue on the train ride.  Both characters are twenty-somethings who are away from home--Jessie is American and Celine is French--but they are well suited conversationalists.  Before getting off the train, Jessie decides to offer Celine an opportunity to spend more time together.  He doesn't have any extra money, so he was planning on just walking around the city all day and all night until it is time to head to the airport, and he thinks it would be a lot more enjoyable with Celine's company. After a brief hesitation, Celine agrees, and the rest of the film consists of the two characters casually wondering around Vienna engaging in a series of conversations, some personal, some profound, and others overly extravagant.From there the plot doesn't get any more complicated.  While each character has his or her own unique disappointments in life, there are no huge reveals, no life defining moment that explains who they are or why they are on this journey.  Both are smart, literate, and liberal, but where Jessie is somewhat of a cynic, Celine has a bit of a radical streak.  In most romantic films there is some contrived event that prevents the two characters from getting together.  There's nothing so obvious in Before Sunrise, but Jessie and Celine do fight against their own disappointments in the world.  Watching their parents and others who have weathered life, they have realized that there are no happy endings.  If there's anything that keeps these two characters apart, it's the realization that what they have cultivated over the course of a night in Vienna cannot last.  Their relationship, as it exists now, has an expiration date.  For most of the film, they are guarded, afraid of really falling for each other.In something of a surprise, Before Sunrise produced two sequels (and Jessie and Celine made cameo appearances in Richard Linklater's film, Waking Life).  After watching Before Sunrise yet again, this makes a lot more sense than you might think.  Throughout the film, Jessie and Celine discuss ways in which family and profession, perception and reality whittle down our idealized romantic notions.  At one point, Jessie says, ""It's just, people have these romantic projections they put on everything that's not based on any kind of reality.""  And it is, after all, a bickering married couple that causes Celine to change seats and meet Jessie in the first place.  Both characters are aware that they may very well become that couple.  In this sense the ending where both Jessie and Celine agree to meet at the same place in six months might have stood as a beautiful cop out.  The ambiguity allows us to envision what might happen in their future without fully exploring these implications.  To Linklater's credit, he decided to do the impossible and find out where these characters are nine years down the road.

Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are great as the young lovers torn between responsibility and fate. The two talk the night away as they discover Vienna and each other. I had a similar experience with a French girl on holidays. We saw each other EVERY day she was in town, and her last three days here were spent living at my place. Sending her home was VERY emotional and came out of left field for me. Some people just &quot;click&quot; and I didn't believe it until it slapped me in the face. My point is that these things really do happen. I still talk to her all the time and she may move here soon. My one gripe is that Jessie and Celine would have exchanged a lot of contact information to see each other again someday. Oh well...Great movie with a great script!

101799,ASJ89T42CIUHU,079073382X,V. Marshall,"[4, 5]","This film is one of the best love stories of all time showing how love can develop from a simple glance or meeting anywhere in the world.Filmed in Vienna the director has managed to take the conversation between two strangers and the beautiful European setting and make a fabulous romance work. He maintains the simplistic integrity all through the film preferring to keep his characters straightforward and thus open to opportunity. The sophisticated conversation develops over a supposed 14 hour period of time that the two people have together and it is both psychologically deep and interesting. And what can you say about Vienna, a beautiful character in itself, holding all the answers just as it did for Freud.Ethan Hawke plays an awkward and unsophisticated American who is taking a Eurorail to Vienna in order to fly back home. He has been rambling about Europe not wanting to go home and face the music of his relationship (with an American student in Spain) having come to an end. Hawke is fantastic in this role showing a vulnerability that is sorely lacking in many young men and entirely captivating to women. Hawke meets a fresh faced and luminous Parisian girl, played by Julie Delpy, while on the Eurorail train and they strike up a conversation so interesting that it exists for the entire film and never gets old or tiresome. Delpy is magnetic as a simple young woman with intelligence and a great adventure for life. Together Hawke and Delpy will have you wrapped around their fingers as their hearts become entangled in the beauty of a grown up romance.If only all strangers were so brilliant to talk to! This easy conversation will leave you pondering the meaning of life and asking yourself or your own loved ones the same questions and hoping for insightful answers. If you love Europe, simple romances and psychology this is the film for you because of its inspiration and profound thinking and of course the beauty of Vienna and the Danube.",5,Before or After Sunrise...It Works!,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1966,"['film', 'one', 'best', 'love', 'stories', 'time', 'showing', 'how', 'love', 'can', 'develop', 'simple', 'glance', 'meeting', 'anywhere', 'world.Filmed', 'Vienna', 'director', 'managed', 'take', 'conversation', 'two', 'strangers', 'beautiful', 'European', 'setting', 'make', 'fabulous', 'romance', 'work', 'simplistic', 'integrity', 'film', 'preferring', 'keep', 'characters', 'straightforward', 'thus', 'open', 'opportunity', 'sophisticated', 'conversation', 'supposed', '14', 'hour', 'period', 'time', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'together', 'psychologically', 'deep', 'interesting', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Vienna', 'beautiful', 'character', 'holding', 'answers', 'just', 'did', 'Freud.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'awkward', 'unsophisticated', 'American', 'who', 'taking', 'Eurorail', 'Vienna', 'order', 'fly', 'back', 'home', 'been', 'rambling', 'Europe', 'not', 'wanting', 'go', 'home', 'face', 'music', 'relationship', 'American', 'student', 'Spain', 'having', 'come', 'end', 'Hawke', 'fantastic', 'role', 'showing', 'vulnerability', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'many', 'young', 'men', 'entirely', 'captivating', 'women', 'Hawke', 'fresh', 'faced', 'luminous', 'Parisian', 'girl', 'played', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Eurorail', 'train', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'so', 'interesting', 'entire', 'film', 'never', 'old', 'tiresome', 'Delpy', 'magnetic', 'simple', 'young', 'woman', 'intelligence', 'great', 'adventure', 'life', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'will', 'have', 'wrapped', 'fingers', 'hearts', 'become', 'entangled', 'beauty', 'grown', 'up', 'romance.If', 'only', 'strangers', 'were', 'so', 'brilliant', 'talk', 'easy', 'conversation', 'will', 'leave', 'pondering', 'meaning', 'life', 'asking', 'own', 'loved', 'ones', 'same', 'questions', 'hoping', 'insightful', 'answers', 'love', 'Europe', 'simple', 'romances', 'psychology', 'film', 'inspiration', 'profound', 'thinking', 'course', 'beauty', 'Vienna', 'Danube']",N/A

101801,A17JVVAKWEB0M,079073382X,Wesley Mullins,"[1, 2]","The set-up for ""Before Sunrise"" appears dangerously cliched and unoriginal: two people meet on a train and have only one night to spend together before one of them must board a plane bound for the other side of the world. Had this film focused on a one-dimensional plot like that, the result would have been a tired tale satisfactory to only a small audience interested in this formulaic premise. Instead, filmmaker Richard Linkleter allows a natural story to unfold built on the interaction between the two characters who are instantly irresistible to each other and their audience.They are Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), a grungy American and a delicate French lady. Their tale is gentle and sensitive, free from scenes of manufactured drama; no ex-boyfriends show up; no misunderstandings resulting from compromising situations; no ultimatums are given. All the film offers in the area of conflict is the natural give-and-take formed when mature, intelligent adults engage in discourse and are totally taken with each other...and that's all it needs.The resulting film features long, charming scenes of the birth of a relationship. Celine and Jesse will remember this night for their rest of their lives, as will the captivated viewers caught up in this enchanting tale. So true to life, the film can cause lapses into believing Jesse and Celine are real people and we are walking the streets of Vienna with them (ironic since Jesse seemed to invent Reality-TV when he pitches his idea for a cable-access show to Celine).Jesse is all that is good about Gen-X.  He is a bit sloppy and scruffy, but lacks the indifference and angst so often associated with 1990s twenty-somethings. Celine's more polished and proper ways counter his actions, creating an interesting juxtaposition within the couple. Both have their quirks and failing traits, but they each seem to accept the small limitations found within us all.The touching conversations are the film's most admirable quality.  Jesse and Celine have giant ideas on a wide variety of subjects (both large and small).  Their skills of philosophical and eclectic musings are matched only by their talent for patient listening, as each gives the other chance to shine while talking and takes a real interest in their thoughts and memories.  In a world too full of people who only wait for their turn to speak, ""Before Sunrise"" shows us all how magic and beauty can grow from an honest exchange between two people who have so much to say and find the right person to say it to.",5,Best romance of the 1990s?,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,2528,"['set-up', 'Sunrise', 'dangerously', 'cliched', 'unoriginal', 'two', 'people', 'meet', 'train', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'night', 'spend', 'together', 'one', 'must', 'board', 'plane', 'bound', 'other', 'side', 'world', 'Had', 'film', 'focused', 'one-dimensional', 'plot', 'result', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tired', 'tale', 'satisfactory', 'only', 'small', 'audience', 'interested', 'formulaic', 'premise', 'Instead', 'filmmaker', 'Richard', 'Linkleter', 'natural', 'story', 'unfold', 'built', 'interaction', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'instantly', 'irresistible', 'other', 'audience.They', 'are', 'Jesse', 'Hawke', 'Celine', 'Delpy', 'grungy', 'American', 'delicate', 'French', 'lady', 'tale', 'gentle', 'sensitive', 'free', 'scenes', 'manufactured', 'drama', 'ex-boyfriends', 'show', 'up', 'misunderstandings', 'resulting', 'compromising', 'situations', 'ultimatums', 'are', 'given', 'film', 'offers', 'area', 'conflict', 'natural', 'give-and-take', 'formed', 'when', 'mature', 'intelligent', 'adults', 'engage', 'discourse', 'are', 'totally', 'taken', 'other', 'needs.The', 'resulting', 'film', 'features', 'long', 'charming', 'scenes', 'birth', 'relationship', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'will', 'remember', 'night', 'rest', 'lives', 'will', 'captivated', 'viewers', 'caught', 'up', 'enchanting', 'tale', 'So', 'true', 'life', 'film', 'can', 'cause', 'lapses', 'believing', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'walking', 'streets', 'Vienna', 'ironic', 'Jesse', 'seemed', 'invent', 'Reality-TV', 'when', 'idea', 'cable-access', 'show', 'Celine', '.Jesse', 'good', 'Gen-X', 'bit', 'sloppy', 'scruffy', 'indifference', 'angst', 'so', 'often', 'associated', '1990s', 'twenty-somethings', 'Celine', 'more', 'polished', 'proper', 'ways', 'counter', 'actions', 'creating', 'interesting', 'juxtaposition', 'couple', 'have', 'quirks', 'failing', 'traits', 'seem', 'accept', 'small', 'limitations', 'found', 'all.The', 'touching', 'conversations', 'are', 'film', 'most', 'admirable', 'quality', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'have', 'giant', 'ideas', 'wide', 'variety', 'subjects', 'large', 'small', 'skills', 'philosophical', 'eclectic', 'musings', 'are', 'matched', 'only', 'talent', 'patient', 'listening', 'other', 'chance', 'shine', 'talking', 'real', 'interest', 'thoughts', 'memories', 'world', 'too', 'full', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'wait', 'turn', 'speak', 'Sunrise', 'how', 'magic', 'beauty', 'can', 'grow', 'honest', 'exchange', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'say', 'find', 'right', 'person', 'say']",N/A
