1655847,A2NJ0FN87IN3CL,B00DJYJOJC,CRAB,"[1, 2]","I have watched a lot of movies over the years and this movie is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever viewed. When you are watching a B grade movie and know it, your expectations adjust and there is at least one or two areas of enjoyment whether it's just downright silly or over the top, that makes you smirk or grin at it's stupidity or weirdness. This movie had well named actors such as William Baldwin, Estella Warren and Sarah Butler in lead roles, so one expected it to be decent. The only character that the audience probably builds any sympathy for was a pathetic weak joke without a clue, who is totally suckered throughout the movie, the winner in the movie is the coldest, most unlikeable character you could find. He was not even a good bad guy that you kind of like to hate. And the Sarah Butler's character although a ""hottie"" was still uninspiring. The whole plot was no surprise (been done better so many times before that it was so predictable) and no twist at the end. Watching this movie was like watching someone throw a ball on the ground and just watching roll till it stopped. I am not exaggerating. There are no memorable moments to even think back on (with the exception of when Sarah Butler takes her clothes off). A total waste. And, I have watched some really terrible movies and never felt so cheated and empty at the end like I felt with this movie. Not even worth free rental.

1655848,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00DJYJOJC,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","Stilted acting, an unconvincing storyline, a script that could have been written by a fourth-grader, hackneyed horror film tropes (zombie imagery, etc), and phony picture-perfect makeup/costume design are all topped-off with a distractingly pervasive soap operatic soundtrack. The cover blurb says that this film is ""A dark and twisted psychological thriller!"" Yet, the ""psychology"" of it all is pretty rudimentary.On the other hand, the cinematography is well-done despite the very low budget. No matter how limited the scope, there is some nice Balearic Islands scenery, and Sarah Butler, as tormented house-guest ""Sarah,"" strips briefly in order to spice things up. Finally, there is some attempt at a twist, even if it's not a terribly original one, at the end.THE STRANGER WITHIN is reminiscent of some of the corniest suspense films of the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Indeed, it echos the title of a 1974 TV movie which apparently has a similar conflict and must have inspired this one.",2,"""Nothiinnng Is Reeaalll!""",1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,983,"['Stilted', 'acting', 'unconvincing', 'storyline', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'fourth-grader', 'hackneyed', 'horror', 'film', 'tropes', 'zombie', 'imagery', 'etc', 'phony', 'picture-perfect', 'makeup/costume', 'design', 'are', 'topped-off', 'distractingly', 'pervasive', 'soap', 'operatic', 'soundtrack', 'cover', 'blurb', 'film', 'A', 'dark', 'twisted', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'psychology', 'pretty', 'rudimentary.On', 'other', 'hand', 'cinematography', 'well-done', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'matter', 'how', 'limited', 'scope', 'nice', 'Balearic', 'Islands', 'scenery', 'Sarah', 'Butler', 'tormented', 'house-guest', 'Sarah', 'briefly', 'order', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'Finally', 'attempt', 'twist', 'even', 'not', 'terribly', 'original', 'one', 'end.THE', 'STRANGER', 'WITHIN', 'reminiscent', 'corniest', 'suspense', 'films', '60s', '70s', '80s', 'Indeed', 'title', '1974', 'TV', 'movie', 'apparently', 'similar', 'conflict', 'must', 'have', 'inspired', 'one']",Stranger Within

1655851,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00DJYJOJC,Tony Heck,"[5, 6]","""I'm just glad that your here and you're willing to help me."" After living through a nightmare, Hollywood star Emily Moore (Warren) and her husband Robert (Baldwin) decide to take a trip to clear her mind and recharge. On their first night a woman in hysterics shows up talking about a terrible accident and the two decide to help her. Little by little she begins to wonder what the girl really wants from them. My expectations for this were not that high mainly because of the cast. I will admit that the movie isn't bad but it is basically a made-for-TV movie with nudity. This is a perfect example of why I try not to watch trailers for movies before I watch the movie. If I went off the trailer I would expect an exciting tense thriller. While this was tense in some parts it was a little slow. The ""twist"" is something that you can see coming but it was still a good idea for the movie. A lot of times the ending can make or break a movie. This is the rare time where the ending left me wondering if it was a neat idea or not. I'm still not sure if I liked the end but I will say the movie was better then I expected. Overall, a little generic but still worth checking out. I have seen much worse. I give it a B-.",3,A little generic but still worth checking out. Has some creepy elements but still feels made-for-TV.
