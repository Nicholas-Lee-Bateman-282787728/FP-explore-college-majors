The music seems to come from within and flow effortlessly outward to a public that appears to have grown jaded with teeny boppers like Britney Spears.

742823,A2TYHWXZPE415M,B00008HCCF,"Jerry Wilson ""Wilstar""","[6, 18]","I purchased this DVD without ever having heard Norah Jones, or at least I thought I hadn't. After playing it, however, I did recognize two of her hits. I bought it because of the genre and because I was hoping she would be similar to Diana Krall, which is one of my favorites.The two artists are similar in many respects, the most obvious being that they are both vocalists, pianists, and have a similar style.I do like this DVD. Norah Jones is a great talent. But she's not yet up to par with Krall. Compared to Diana Krall's &quot;Live in Paris&quot; concert DVD, Jones's lacks polish and class.Although her music is fine, the overal performance seems almost like a practice session. Primarily, her accompanyists are not nearly up to par with her singing ability. The drums sounded like a cheap toy set. And, compared to Krall's full orchestral accompaniment, Norah Jones's accompaniment was a tad sparse.Krall's sleek black dress, suit-clad musicians, and polished style contrasts sharply to Jones's casual attire, garage-band musicians, and relaxed demeanor. Their respective pianos are metaphors for their shows. Both are Steinways, but Krall's is brilliantly polished and reflective while Jones's is dull.Not having a large number of accompanying musicians, it is not surprising that the Norah Jones DVD's 5.1 surround sound does not have enough separation. It is basically in stereo, with the surround speakers being relegated to applause from the audience.Still, Jones is an excellent pianist with a great Blues quality to her voice. I did enjoy the DVD as I'm sure all Norah Jones fans will.

742824,A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N,B00008HCCF,J. Lizzi,"[4, 5]","That Norah Jones has one of the most soothing voices and easy-to-listen-to song repertoires is far and away the major selling point of her music. ""Live in New Orleans"" delivers a nice compilation of smooth tunes in an intimate setting (House of Blues) that is likely to impress anyone who checks out this recording.I'm not sure how to classify Norah's music, but her voice is the most enchanting to come along since Sade landed in the early 1980's. Naturally, the focus of this DVD, both musically and visually, is on Norah herself, but in no way does the rest of her Very Handsome Band get left in the shadows (literally or figuratively). The camera images tend to fade in and out from close-ups of Norah's face, to a couple measures of a bass/guitar/drum lick, to Norah's hands on the keyboards, and back again. It's very simple, but not necessarily monotonous. I applaud producer/director Jim Gabour's efforts in leaving out any glitzy or contrived visual aspects: the performance is as easy to watch as it is to listen to.Save for four songs plus the encore, the musical selection (15 songs total) is entirely from the ""Come Away With Me"" album. I liked every track of this DVD; thus I'd rate this a very strong performance overall. As with all great live concerts, parts of many songs contained different twists or improvisations, and I loved the way Norah eased into ""Don't Know Why"" without everyone noticing right away. Oddly enough, I don't think we're seeing the entire show (run time is 67 minutes). You can tell this by some of the edits, but the big giveaway is after ""Lonestar,"" when Norah remarks to the band's tour manager and backing vocalist, Daru Oda, that she'll be back on stage later in the show. Unfortunately, that's the last we see of Daru.Concerning the band, the guys stay pretty tight, even without the preponderance of interaction that is so common in jazz performances. My only criticism (a minor one) of the sound quality is that the percussion crashed a little too loudly on a couple numbers. Perhaps this had to do with the way Andrew Borger's drum kit was miked, but I'll make an allowance for the character of the venue. Still, you might have to turn down your sub-woofer a tad to avoid an occasionally boomin' bass drum.CD ""extras"": 1) one encore song, which could have been placed in-line with the other tunes in order to avoid having to access it by flipping through menus; 2) video of ""Come Away With Me,"" which is well done.",5,Easy listening; smooth artistry; excellent show,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,2464,"['Norah', 'Jones', 'one', 'most', 'soothing', 'voices', 'easy-to-listen-to', 'song', 'repertoires', 'far', 'away', 'major', 'selling', 'point', 'music', 'Live', 'New', 'Orleans', 'nice', 'compilation', 'smooth', 'tunes', 'intimate', 'setting', 'House', 'Blues', 'likely', 'impress', 'anyone', 'who', 'out', 'recording.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'classify', 'Norah', 'music', 'voice', 'most', 'enchanting', 'come', 'along', 'Sade', 'landed', 'early', '1980', 'Naturally', 'focus', 'DVD', 'musically', 'visually', 'Norah', 'way', 'rest', 'Very', 'Handsome', 'Band', 'get', 'left', 'shadows', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'camera', 'tend', 'fade', 'close-ups', 'Norah', 'face', 'couple', 'measures', 'bass/guitar/drum', 'lick', 'Norah', 'hands', 'keyboards', 'back', 'again', 'very', 'simple', 'not', 'necessarily', 'monotonous', 'applaud', 'producer/director', 'Jim', 'Gabour', 'efforts', 'leaving', 'out', 'glitzy', 'contrived', 'visual', 'aspects', 'performance', 'easy', 'watch', 'listen', 'to.Save', 'four', 'songs', 'encore', 'musical', 'selection', '15', 'songs', 'total', 'entirely', 'Come', 'Away', 'Me', 'album', 'liked', 'track', 'DVD', 'thus', ""'d"", 'rate', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'overall', 'great', 'live', 'concerts', 'parts', 'many', 'songs', 'contained', 'different', 'twists', 'improvisations', 'loved', 'way', 'Norah', 'eased', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Why', 'everyone', 'noticing', 'right', 'away', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'entire', 'show', 'run', 'time', '67', 'minutes', 'can', 'tell', 'edits', 'big', 'giveaway', 'Lonestar', 'when', 'Norah', 'remarks', 'band', 'tour', 'manager', 'backing', 'vocalist', 'Daru', 'Oda', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'stage', 'later', 'show', 'Unfortunately', 'last', 'see', 'Daru.Concerning', 'band', 'guys', 'stay', 'pretty', 'tight', 'even', 'preponderance', 'interaction', 'so', 'common', 'jazz', 'performances', 'only', 'criticism', 'minor', 'one', 'sound', 'quality', 'percussion', 'crashed', 'little', 'too', 'loudly', 'couple', 'numbers', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'do', 'way', 'Andrew', 'Borger', 'drum', 'kit', 'was', 'miked', ""'ll"", 'make', 'allowance', 'character', 'venue', 'Still', 'might', 'have', 'turn', 'down', 'sub-woofer', 'tad', 'avoid', 'occasionally', 'boomin', 'bass', 'drum.CD', 'extras', '1', 'one', 'encore', 'song', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'placed', 'in-line', 'other', 'tunes', 'order', 'avoid', 'having', 'access', 'flipping', 'menus', '2', 'video', 'Come', 'Away', 'Me', 'well', 'done']",N/A

This is not a knock on it, but just a comment on the style of music and the presentation of the concert footage.  The feature is an hour long performance by Norah at the House of Blues in New Orleans.  She has a backing back, but the show is pretty much just Norah at the piano.  She does some cover songs as well as stuff from her album ""Come Away With Me"".  She also mentions that some songs are only on her previous EP, which she expects that most people do not have.If you have listened to her album, you have a pretty good idea what to expect from this DVD.  She doesn't talk much between songs, usually only to introduce the next song or to say who she is covering on a song.  This may be a good thing if she doesn't have anything interesting to say, it would only detract from the performance.  This is a fairly low key performance, but her playing is amazing.  Norah Jones is a very gifted musician with a beautiful voice.The only comment I have in closing is that while I really enjoyed listening (and watching) to this DVD, I don't think it is something that I would watch very often.

Here, Norah says good night, the credits roll, the picture fades to black, and we're sent back to the main menu.  Then, when you click on the ""encore"" icon in the extras section, we're right back in New Orleans with Norah back on stage performing ""Tennessee Waltz"" (a great rendition, by the way).  Yes, it's a small point, but that extra clicking around was needless and broke the flow of the performance a bit.  Also, some of the lighting was harsh (Norah has what looks like a blue electrical sheen on her face all through one song, which was kind of annoying), and with an excessive amount of fading from one shot to another, the direction drew attention to itself and came off as distracting. But in the end all these things qualify as quibbles, as the musical performance itself- aided by the DVD's excellent sound- is subtle, nuanced, sensual, and very sweet.  Norah is the real deal, a fact that comes through clearly on this DVD.",4,"Good DVD, but absolutely terrific performance",1046390400,"02 28, 2003",2003,1410,"['fun', 'sweet', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'performance', 'coupled', 'out-of-this-world', 'audio', 'quality', 'modestly', 'priced', 'DVD', 'must', 'buy', 'get', 'hear', 'most', 'songs', 'Norah', 'Come', 'Away', 'Me', 'CD', 'couple', 'other', 'good', 'pieces', 'Extras', 'include', 'Come', 'Away', 'Me', 'music', 'video', 'encore', 'song', 'main', 'concert', 'DVD', 'chronicled', 'Actually', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'main', 'concert', 'just', 'flowed', 'right', 'encore', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', 'real', 'life', 'Here', 'Norah', 'good', 'night', 'credits', 'roll', 'picture', 'black', ""'re"", 'sent', 'back', 'main', 'menu', 'Then', 'when', 'click', 'encore', 'icon', 'extras', 'section', ""'re"", 'right', 'back', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Norah', 'back', 'stage', 'performing', 'Tennessee', 'Waltz', 'great', 'rendition', 'way', 'Yes', 'small', 'point', 'extra', 'clicking', 'around', 'was', 'needless', 'broke', 'flow', 'performance', 'bit', 'Also', 'lighting', 'was', 'harsh', 'Norah', 'what', 'blue', 'electrical', 'sheen', 'face', 'one', 'song', 'was', 'kind', 'annoying', 'excessive', 'amount', 'fading', 'one', 'shot', 'direction', 'drew', 'attention', 'came', 'off', 'distracting', 'end', 'things', 'qualify', 'quibbles', 'musical', 'performance', 'itself-', 'aided', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'sound-', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'sensual', 'very', 'sweet', 'Norah', 'real', 'deal', 'fact', 'through', 'clearly', 'DVD']",N/A

Whether the Grammy was a one-hit-wonder glitch or a confirmation of her talents is a moot issue.What is obvious in this New Orleans performance is her artistry -- no embellishments, just simplicity and grace. Norah exudes femininity which is sometimes hard to convey in a jazz setting; her voice, oftentimes soulful and melancholic, comes across intimately in Lonestar, Bessie Smith, The Painter Song and the surprise encore Tennessee Waltz. Her now familiar ""Don't Know Why"" and ""Come Away with Me"", performed live, are enough reasons for having this DVD.In the musical world where artistic integrity are often compromised, it is nice to have for more than a 'brief shining moment' a lone star like Norah Jones.",4,Norah's shining moment,1048204800,"03 21, 2003",2003,871,"['Norah', 'Jones', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'keyboard', 'proficiency', 'Dianna', 'Krall', 'polished', 'vocal', 'range', 'Sade', 'what', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'eight', 'Grammys', 'Grammy', 'was', 'one-hit-wonder', 'glitch', 'confirmation', 'talents', 'moot', 'issue.What', 'obvious', 'New', 'Orleans', 'performance', 'artistry', 'embellishments', 'just', 'simplicity', 'grace', 'Norah', 'femininity', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'convey', 'jazz', 'setting', 'voice', 'oftentimes', 'soulful', 'melancholic', 'across', 'intimately', 'Lonestar', 'Bessie', 'Smith', 'Painter', 'Song', 'surprise', 'encore', 'Tennessee', 'Waltz', 'now', 'familiar', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Why', 'Come', 'Away', 'Me', 'performed', 'live', 'are', 'enough', 'reasons', 'having', 'DVD.In', 'musical', 'world', 'where', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'are', 'often', 'compromised', 'nice', 'have', 'more', ""'brief"", 'shining', 'moment', 'lone', 'star', 'Norah', 'Jones']",N/A

Recorded at the House of Blues, Norah (and her band) gives an excellent and intimate performance. Fans will rejoice with the inclusion of some non-album tracks, including Comes love, Bessie Smith, Something is calling you, What am I to you?, and the concert encore Tennessee waltz. Along with these you get many of her much loved songs including the likes of the superlative Don't know why, Come away with me, One flight down and many more. It's a shame songs like Shoot the moon and Turn me on aren't here, but hey...you can't have everything.Picture quality is excellent - very crisp, vibrant colors, and full screen. Sound is equally impressive. Unfortunately the DVD is a little low on extras; you get the aforementioned concert encore (though why this is separated away from the main concert is beyond me) and one music video, for ""Come away with me"". Why didn't they include some of her other videos though?.Nevertheless, and minor criticisms aside, this is a great first DVD of one of the most promising new artists in years.

All were well deserved and on the heels of that success, she picked the right time to release her first DVD.  It's from a performance from July, 2002 at The House of Blues in New Orleans and it captures the essence of her music.  The show is cool and laid back, and a throwback to vintage stylings as is the DVD's direction.  The camera work lingers on Ms. Jones and her band for long moments, allowing the viewer to soak in each performer's image.  We get long close-ups and not the usual herky-jerky, fast cuts of most concert films.  The concert contains almost every song from her lone album,  Come Away With Me as well as some choice covers including a standout version of The Band's ""Bessie Smith"".

This DVD pleasantly presents Nora with her humble, laid-back style.I too have the John Mayer DVD and I agree it displays an artist with more humor and a quirky personality, but I think that is because that is John Mayer's personality - he's funnier and quirkier.  Likewise, the Nora Jones DVD displays HER personality as a relaxed, honest and ego-free performer.  I wouldn't knock Nora for not being John!Anyway, this DVD is fairly true to the album, but not totally.  While Nora doesn't take many piano solos, vocally, she does take more liberties in the live performance.  Also, it is interesting to see the variety of methods the drummer uses to provide rhythm for the various cuts.The concert has an intimate, friendly tone.
