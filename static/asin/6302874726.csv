I first saw this movie when I was 10 and managed to tape it- thank goodness because 15 years later I have never seen it again-ANYWHERE. I was just looking on Amazon and found it-not on dvd of course- but I grabbed it. Even if this movie cost me $[...] I would still buy it. There is no other ghost story around that touched me quite like this one.You already know the plot-family moves into a castle and the little girl meets a ghost who wants them out of the house at ONCE. The ghost is cranky and has a cold and thinks that the little girl is so annoying-until she starts to applaud him for his efforts in getting them OUT of the house.Ok, so the movie hasn't been released on dvd. That happens. Get yourselves a vcr and order it because they most likely will never re-release it and the price can only go UP.

Neal,"[17, 19]","A young Alyssa Milano stars as Jennifer Canterville, a young girl who is being transported from the life she knows into a strange new  home in a new country with a new family. Jennifer's father, Harry, played by Ted Wass (who would later star in the popular tv show Blossom) has a new bride and decides to take over their family estate, the Canterville Castle.When the new Cantervilles arrive, strange occurances immediately ensue. Hummel, the butler, is hung from a chandalier and loses the luggage, a ghostly apparation appears on the stairs and warns the family to leave or be sorry, and a mysterious spider interrupts the new couple's intimate moments! The family is informed that the Ghost of Sir Simon Canterville (played tremendously by Sir John Gielgud) haunts the castle to ensure that no one takes possession of his home. None of the family, except Jennifer, believe the story that their new home is haunted.Being a young, naive youngster, Jennifer is immediately enthralled with the idea that there is a ghost in the castle. One evening she follows him to his chambers, where he does his best to scare her to no avail, leaving her instead smiling. She tells Sir Simon that she is not scared of him, instead she wants to team up with him to scare her parents out of the castle so that she can return to her old home. Sir Simon and Jennifer then become friends, causing many exciting twists and turns, including Jennifer helping Sir Simon find eternal peace. Sir Simon and Jennifer's meaningful relationship make this made-for-tv movie a quick and enjoyable watch.I was 5 or 6 when I first watched this film, and still enjoy it today. I puchased this vhs copy, which I'm glad I did, since there is no dvd version available and now the vhs is out of print.
