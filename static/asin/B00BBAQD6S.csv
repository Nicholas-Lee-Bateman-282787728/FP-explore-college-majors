1624118,AYRFLAT8VF732,B00BBAQD6S,"DC_Fan_52 ""-Weasel!""","[0, 0]","Overall, Superman Unbound is a good/almost great movie. This is supposed to be Superman meeting the ""real"" Brainiac for the first time. If he ever met Brainiac before, that was just a robotic double. It's based on the Graphic NovelSuperman: Brainiacby Geoff Johns and Gary Frank. They tried to replicate the art by Gary Frank, but Gray Frank uses a realistic looking style that doesn't transfer well to animation. Especially in the faces, which appear oversimplified. Regardless, it's a reasonable plot that came out more cohesive in this adaptation when compared to the source material.What makes this story significant, in the eyes of fans, is that this might be the last appearance of the traditional version of Superman for a long time. After this, they're going to switch to the ""New 52"" version of the character, where he wears armor. Why Superman needs armor, I don't know. In a funny coincidence, they seem to put a cap on Superman and Lois's relationship.Even though all these movies aren't in continuity with each other, way back inSuperman: Doomsday [Blu-ray] Superman finally admitted that he and Lois are dating. Something he never admitted in neither ""Superman: the Animated Series"" or ""Justice League/ Unlimitted"". Superman: Ubound ends with Clark proposing to Lois. It's poignant, because they're not together anymore in the ""New 52.""This is also Superman at the height of his power and experience. He has no problem ripping robots to pieces and putting out fires. He's clearly been saving the day for years, so much so that Lois never doubts that everything is under control. Which leads to the accusations that this is ""Lois and Clark"" the Movie (Based on the 90s Romantic Drama), or that somehow Superman is a wimp because he ""can't control his woman."" The theme of the movie is about ""control,"" and how it can be a bad thing. Kal-El doesn't need a hysterical woman in his life, he need a partner. Lois is completely unflappable in the face of danger, and that extends to telling Clark to his face, ""Don' tell me what I can't do.""And for those saying Brainiac is defeated by germaphobia, I say that's a gross oversimplification of what happens. I'll also point out that ""Heart of Ice,"" the greatest episode from Batman the Animated Series, ends when Batman throws soup in Mr.Freeze's face. Thankfully he carried that thermos on his utility belt, instead of leaving it in the Batmobile.FInally, I must say John Noble really stole the show as Brainiac. Every syllable he uttered was awesome. What makes Brainiac a great villain, is that he's the opposite of Superman. While Superman is clearly superior to humans, he likes to pretend to be one of us, and says we can be like him. To Brainiac, all are insects that at best should be kept in jars, or else just pests to be exterminated.

1624127,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00BBAQD6S,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","I read my first Superman comic in 1970.  (Yes, I'm THAT old.)  I've always loved Superman as a character.  Superman fans have suffered a bit of disparagement over the years due to the fact that most non-regular Supes readers think that the Man of Steel isn't quite a legitimate hero because he's invulnerable.  He can do everything.  ""It's always so predictable,"" critics gripe, ""because, in the end, you know that Superman will triumph.""  Well, here's news for you, readers: in the end of every Batman comic book, Batman triumphs.  In the end of every Spider-man comic book, Spider-man triumphs.  In the end of every Green Lantern comic book ... I think you get the picture.  (If you don't, then leave now.)I get it: you don't like Superman.  If you don't like Superman, then you're likely not going to enjoy much of SUPERMAN UNBOUND ... so what are you doing reading this review in the first place?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)An alien android crashes in the desert north of Phoenix, and only Superman can stop the being in its tracks.  But just what was it sent here to do, and why is it that the sight of the thing causes Kara (aka Supergirl) to shudder?  As `Big Blue' learns, the android was little more than an advance probe sent by a ruthless machine force known as Brainiac.  Now that the conqueror is aware of Earth, that means he'll soon be on his way here ... but not if Superman can intercept him first!Brainiac never was one of my favorite villains.  He always tended to be minimized to little more than a machine intelligence - think of him like a one-man Borg Army from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION - who went about the universe collecting specimens and then destroying the host bodies.  There never was any singular or compelling reason for Brainiac to do what he did, though I understand his first appearance (in 1958) had him collecting these various cities with the hope of inevitably rebuilding his own destroyed world.  Once that directive (or motivation) gets removed from the equation, then he just becomes a collector of what could be termed `antiques,' and he loses much of the narrative impact.That's kinda/sorta the problem as I see it with SUPERMAN UNBOUND.  Even in the conclusion, Superman dismisses and thwarts Brainiac by practically drawing that same comparison - that he's a collector who's not seriously interested in the things he collects, not in any way that would require the clipping, shrinking, and cataloguing of them.  Even in Brainiac's massive skull-shaped ship, the villain has arranged the `bottled cities' geographically by where he took them from the universe.  It feels like an old-style library card-catalogue - routine, scientific, almost sterilized - and it left me feeling, ""What's the big appeal of that?""Quirks aside, the rest of UNBOUND felt a bit too routine.  There's an opening action sequence that involves Lois Lane's kidnapping, and, disappointingly, it has little to do with the overall story; in fact, it only serves as an opening action sequence, so far as I could tell.  Screenwriter Bob Goodman (working from the comic written by Gary Frank and Geoff Johns) tries to give it some relevance with a final climactic scene involving the future of Superman and Lois, but it didn't quite feel right to me.  Weighing down Superman with some metrosexual sentiments - who am I? what do I want out of life? can I be happy? - didn't work for the film, SUPERMAN RETURNS, so why would you want to revisit that canard?As for the animation style?  It leaves a bit to be desired.  Clearly, the artists here were working off of strong anime influences, but what's up with Ms. Lane?  Why did you make her so horribly pale?  Superman requires the yellow sun, so doesn't it stand to reason that, as his kinda/sorta significant other, she'd get some, too?  Seriously, she looks almost Gothic in a few scenes.  But, thankfully, Andrea Romano continues bringing some respectable A-listers in for voice work - Matt Bomer does a better Supes than he does Clark; Stana Katic delivers the best that she can with an underutilized Lois; Molly Quinn does justice to Kara/Supergirl; but John Noble (as Brainiac) hits it outta the park!SUPERMAN UNBOUND is produced by DC Entertainment, Warner Bros. Animation, and Warner Premiere.  DVD distribution is being handled by Warner Bros.  As for the technical specifications, the production looks and sounds pretty exception, although there is some curious sound editing in the sequence wherein Kandor is seized and altered by Brainiac (Kara's flashback).  The package comes with an assortment of special features including ""Brainiac: Technology and Terror,"" a preview of the next DC Universe animated film, four bonus cartoons from the DC Vaults, and a digital comic book excerpt from the graphic novel that inspired the script, ""Superman: Brainiac.""  Also, the Blu-ray edition includes two additional bits: ""Kandor: History of the Bottle City"" and an audio commentary track.  As is often the case with DC's direct-to-DVD products, it's a nice assortment given the modest investment of the purchase price, one that should keep fans busy for a few additional hours.RECOMMENDED.  As DC Comics direct-to-DVD movies go, SUPERMAN UNBOUND is acceptable.  The animation style is a bit quirky for my tastes, but it offers up a pretty solid slate of voice work (John Noble, can you do no wrong?).  It certainly doesn't pack the `event' quality of the last DC two-parter (THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS), and, sadly, it isn't quite the origin or version of Brainiac I would've liked to have seen committed to celluloid (trust me, there has been much tinkering in comics so far as this character is concerned).  Still, this old-school Superman fan dug most of it to give it a solid thumbs up.  It might end up a bit forgettable based on DC's other releases, but isn't that always a legitimate risk?",3,A Middling SUPERMAN UNBOUND Does The Best It Can To Save The Universe ...

That's all about to change on June 14 when ""Man of Steel"" hits theaters. DC and Warner Premiere aren't going to settle for TV commercials and trailers to get people pumped up. Two new comic books and a DC Universe Animated Original Movie entitled ""Superman Unbound"" are keeping the super hero fresh on everyone's minds as well.""Superman Unbound"" serves as a tasty appetizer for the main meal coming up. The Man of Steel joins forces with his cousin, Supergirl, to battle Brainiac after the super villain shrinks down Metropolis and adds it to his collection of cities from different planets he's destroyed. Superman must find a way to keep Braniac from destroying the Earth and save all the captured cities of the universe, including Krypton's capitol Kandor.As is usual with the DC animated movies, ""Superman Unbound"" is loaded with action from the beginning to the end. Director James Tucker and writer Bob Goodman know how to keep the pace moving at a breakneck speed and demand the audience's attention. You take a 128 page graphic novel and shove it into a 75 minute film. There's no time for the viewer to get distracted or for the movie to lose steam.The animation for ""Superman Unbound"" differs from what we've come to expect from the DC animated features. It varies in style greatly from ""Superman vs. The Elite."" One example is the Man of Steel's facial features. The other characters look different as well.""Superman Unbound"" is definitely a PG-13 movie. There are scenes of Braniac changing himself into a cyborg that would freak out little kids. His robots drill into the heads of their victims, which splashes a lot of blood around onscreen. Lois Lane also flips Braniac the double birds in one scene. Superman even says a bad word at one point. There are also some light sexual references most kids won't pick up on, but they're still present.The high definition presentation of ""Superman Unbound"" is clean and sounds good. There's a little banding in the backgrounds, but nothing too distracting visually. The 5.1 surround sound will ensure that you're home theater setup will tremble and shake from the explosions and other sonic treats.Warner treats fans to a hefty batch of special features for ""Superman Unbound."" Audio commentary is provided by Director / Producer James Tucker, Screenwriter Bob Goodman, and comic industry writer Mike Carlin. Two featurettes entitled ""Brainiac: Technology and Terror"" and ""Kandor: History of the Bottle City"" are included. Four episodes from ""Superman: The Animated Series"" are featured as well. There's a sneak preview of the next DC Animated feature, ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox."" In addition, a few pages of the graphic novel the movie is based on (""Superman: Braniac"") are highlighted.The Blu-ray version of ""Superman Unbound"" is a worthy purchase for any fan of the Man of Steel. It's packed with entertaining bonus material and an action-packed feature that's a step above last year's ""Superman vs. The Elite."" What we get here is a super tag team smack down with none of the heavy-handed social commentary or politically correct propaganda we experienced last time around.",4,"""Superman Unbound"" Blu-ray Review",1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,3256,"['past', 'eight', 'years', 'Batman', 'received', 'love', 'movies', 'when', 'DC', 'Comics', 'characters', 'change', 'June', '14', 'when', 'Man', 'Steel', 'theaters', 'DC', 'Warner', 'Premiere', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'settle', 'TV', 'commercials', 'trailers', 'get', 'people', 'pumped', 'up', 'Two', 'new', 'comic', 'books', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Animated', 'Original', 'Movie', 'entitled', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'are', 'keeping', 'super', 'hero', 'fresh', 'everyone', 'minds', 'as', 'well', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'tasty', 'appetizer', 'main', 'meal', 'coming', 'up', 'Man', 'Steel', 'joins', 'forces', 'cousin', 'Supergirl', 'battle', 'Brainiac', 'super', 'villain', 'shrinks', 'down', 'Metropolis', 'collection', 'cities', 'different', 'planets', 'destroyed', 'Superman', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'keep', 'Braniac', 'destroying', 'Earth', 'save', 'captured', 'cities', 'universe', 'including', 'Krypton', 'capitol', 'Kandor.As', 'usual', 'DC', 'animated', 'movies', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'loaded', 'action', 'beginning', 'end', 'Director', 'James', 'Tucker', 'writer', 'Bob', 'Goodman', 'know', 'how', 'keep', 'pace', 'moving', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'demand', 'audience', 'attention', 'take', '128', 'page', 'graphic', 'novel', 'shove', '75', 'minute', 'film', 'time', 'viewer', 'get', 'distracted', 'movie', 'lose', 'steam.The', 'animation', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'differs', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'DC', 'animated', 'features', 'style', 'greatly', 'Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'One', 'example', 'Man', 'Steel', 'facial', 'features', 'other', 'characters', 'look', 'different', 'as', 'well', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'definitely', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'Braniac', 'changing', 'cyborg', 'would', 'freak', 'out', 'little', 'kids', 'robots', 'drill', 'heads', 'victims', 'lot', 'blood', 'onscreen', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'also', 'Braniac', 'double', 'birds', 'one', 'scene', 'Superman', 'even', 'bad', 'word', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'also', 'light', 'sexual', 'references', 'most', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', ""'re"", 'still', 'present.The', 'high', 'definition', 'presentation', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'clean', 'good', 'little', 'banding', 'backgrounds', 'nothing', 'too', 'distracting', 'visually', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'will', 'ensure', ""'re"", 'home', 'theater', 'setup', 'will', 'tremble', 'shake', 'explosions', 'other', 'sonic', 'treats.Warner', 'treats', 'fans', 'hefty', 'batch', 'special', 'features', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Director', '/', 'Producer', 'James', 'Tucker', 'Screenwriter', 'Bob', 'Goodman', 'comic', 'industry', 'writer', 'Mike', 'Carlin', 'Two', 'featurettes', 'entitled', 'Brainiac', 'Technology', 'Terror', 'Kandor', 'History', 'Bottle', 'City', 'are', 'included', 'Four', 'episodes', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'are', 'featured', 'well', 'sneak', 'preview', 'next', 'DC', 'Animated', 'feature', 'Justice', 'League', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'addition', 'few', 'pages', 'graphic', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'Superman', 'Braniac', 'are', 'highlighted.The', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'fan', 'Man', 'Steel', 'packed', 'entertaining', 'bonus', 'material', 'action-packed', 'feature', 'step', 'last', 'year', 'Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'What', 'get', 'here', 'super', 'tag', 'team', 'smack', 'down', 'none', 'heavy-handed', 'social', 'commentary', 'politically', 'correct', 'propaganda', 'experienced', 'last', 'time']",N/A

1624134,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BBAQD6S,FNDNreview,"[14, 21]","The DC Comics animation library is a mixed bag.  For the most part, it's hard to recognize whether these newly released direct-to-video animation films are meant to entertain viewers or to just make a quick studio money grab.  Often coinciding with live action theatrical releases, it' difficult to ignore the timely release dates of direct-to-video films in order to give them their fair shake.  In 2008, Warner Bros. released Batman: Gotham Knight (a mere 10 days prior to The Dark Knight ), which supposedly bridges the gap between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight - even though it officially has no place in the Christopher Nolan universe.  Huh?  Yeah, that's exactly the point.  The following summer, it happened again with the straight-to-video release of Green Lantern: Emerald Knights, which was released a week prior to the theatrical debut of Green Lantern, starring Ryan Reynolds.  While there have been some well-received DC animated films, like Batman: Under the Hood and Green Lantern: First Flight, it's hard to imagine Superman: Unbound receiving a fair trial in that regard, especially with the release of Man of Steel only a month away.Based on Geoff Johns' Brainiac storyline from 2008's Action Comics, Superman: Unbound focuses on Superman (voiced by Matt Bomer) and his first interaction with Brainiac (voiced by John Noble).  While in a strenuous relationship with Lois Lane (voiced by Stana Katic) and helping to raise his cousin Kara/Supergirl (voiced by Molly Quinn), Clark Kent/Superman is suddenly thrust into action when a scout robot falls from outer space.  After Kara sees the robot, she identifies it as being controlled by Brainiac, a knowledge-collecting entity that pillages planets (including Krypton) for information, and taking major cities as a souvenir (putting them in a display bottle).  In his encounter with Brainiac, Superman discovers that the former capital of the destroyed planet of Krypton, Kandor, is in Brainiac's possession (Kyptonian citizens included).  With the fate of Metropolis and Kandor hanging in the balance, Superman and Supergirl must find a way to defeat Brainiac and free the cities before they are destroyed.  The voices of Frances Conroy (Martha Kent), Wade Williams (Perry White), and Alexander Gould (Jimmy Olson) also star in supporting roles.For the comic book readers out there, this version of Superman is not of the `New 52' variety.  What does that mean exactly?  In the comic book world, Superman/Clark Kent is married to Lois Lane - or at least they were before DC decided to completely reboot their universe in 2011.  Dubbed the `New 52,' Superman and Lois Lane were split up and are no longer together.  However, in the newly released Superman: Unbound film, Lois and Clark have been dating (presumably for quite a while), but it's still a secret - even from their co-workers.  The plot of this film seemingly picks up at random, picks and choose what information to use from past comic book story-lines, with no other ambition other than to introduce Brainiac (which is a character that's already been around for more than 50 years).  At the same time, this new animated film isn't a reboot, like All Star Superman - rather just another typical Smallville-like story where Superman is roaming around outer space and pleading with his cousin (Supergirl) to relax.As far as character development goes, Brainiac is the only character that's of any real interest over the course of the film.  John Noble gives the character a methodic tone that really establishes Brainiac as a super villain that should be taken seriously.  However, Brainiac never becomes a serious concern for Superman at any point, since Superman apparently could have disposed of the super-villain early on in the film - but it's really hard to justify the purchase cost of a plot that only needed to be a 25 minute Superman: The Animated Series episode.  This happens to be one of those stories where it might have been more interesting if there was another villain plotting against Superman at the same time - say Lex Luthor or Bizzaro.The film's characters leave a great deal more to be desired in the development department, not to mention it's pretty bothersome to see Lois Lane flying the double bird at Brianiac, and an implication that Clark Kent is gay.  Combine those segments with the violence, hard language, and bloodshed, and it quickly becomes a film that parents probably shouldn't be showing to kids (but that's a judgement).  Aside from those bothersome encounters, the general direction of the plot is still in limbo, mostly because screen writer Bob Goodman has the story taking place at random, without any clear character back-story.Since this film is based off a popular comic book storyline (only 5 issues long, though), it doesn't veer off from its original course too much.  In the comics, the Brainiac plot is famous for killing off Pa Kent (for about the eighth time total if you include the comics/movies/television), however, Unbound features a much different subplot and a much less depressing plot at that.  Obviously, you'll get no spoiler ending here, but let's just say is the door wide open for a sequel.  In fact, there's really no need to even say the door is wide open - it basically guarantees a sequel.Overall, the film hardly stands out over previous Superman animation endeavors, but there's enough action and plot drama to sustain interest over the course of the film (barely).  At the same time, the poor animation is a hang-up.  It's certainly no Pixar, making it difficult to lower the bar for this viewing experience, largely due to the fact there's even superior television animation out there (ex. Star Wars: The Clone Wars).  Superman: Unbound is only a must see for Superman fans, but everyone else is encouraged to buy the Superman: Brainiac graphic novel instead, which is much more enjoyable.Overall Grade:

It was an emotional story and now it is adapted in animation for general audiences to see what Brainiac has become in the books.I really enjoyed this movie. Not much background is needed to enjoy it, either in the comics or when watching this. Superman and Kara (Supergirl) are attacked by a droid that turns out to be a scout searching for worlds to collect as specimens. Kara recalls how before she escaped Krypton, Brainiac sent similar droids to attack her city (KANDOR) then removed it from the planet as a souvenir for his collection. Now that these droids have appeared again, they fear that Metropolis may be Brainiac's next victim. Determined to prevent the past from repeating itself, Superman plans to find Brainiac and stop him before he is able to steal any more worlds. What follows afterward is an interesting look at the characters Clark, Kara, and Lois and how they each deal with fears associated with protecting loved ones.Character development is shallow with the exception of Brainiac, but some witty dialog and humor make up for it. This should have not been rated PG-13 however. The animation is solid during action scenes, but otherwise the characters (again with the exception of Brainiac) look odd.All in all, pretty entertaining.

Alford,"[0, 0]","Since his big-budget remake is about to hit theatres, it was timely that DC Universe decided to make their next release another ""just Superman"" title. Animation veteran Alan Burnett takes on as producer in this adaptation of the recent Superman: Braniac story arc from the comics by Geoff Johns, which was later collected into a graphic novel.Set sometime after Supergirl first arrived on Earth, Superman encounters a strange alien android. After defeating it, he takes it to the Fortress of Solitude, which shocks Supergirl into remembering how the city of Kandor on Krypton was taken away by a powerful invader known as Brainiac. Fearing Earth might attacked by Brainiac, Superman heads out into space to hunt for him. After stopping him from destroying another world, Supes gets taken aboard Brainy's giant ""skulltopus"" ship, and comes face-to-face with the Martian Manhunter-lookalike himself. Brainiac shrinks Superman down into the now bottle city of Kandor, and meets Supergirl's parents. Superman manages to get big again, and takes Kandor with him back to Earth. Brainiac follows, and shrinks Metropolis. Superman and Supergirl team up to stop Brainiac, while taking on all the dangers of his ship. After pulling him literally down to Earth, Supers manages to overwhelm Brainiac with being exposed to all the elements of an actual thriving world instead of observing them within his little bottled cities. This shuts down the mad computer, although the stinger at the end indicates not permanently.This was a well executed animated feature, and a definite step up from the Superman Vs. The Elite movie at least as far as animation quality. There were some things from this that were left out of the original story, like Pa Kent's death, and any ties to the rest of the DC Universe. Also, Superman restores Kandor on an alien planet with a red sun, instead of on Earth, which in the comic leads into the whole New Krypton story arc. The movie can be viewed as a slight sequel to Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, since it begins with a still fresh from space Supergirl, although it's apparent its trying to be its own entity. It's definitely worth a look if you're a big Superfan, but it also makes for a good sci-fi/superhero movie too.",4,Brainiac Attacks done right,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,2240,"['big-budget', 'remake', 'hit', 'theatres', 'was', 'timely', 'DC', 'Universe', 'decided', 'make', 'next', 'release', 'just', 'Superman', 'title', 'Animation', 'veteran', 'Alan', 'Burnett', 'producer', 'adaptation', 'recent', 'Superman', 'Braniac', 'story', 'arc', 'comics', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'was', 'later', 'collected', 'graphic', 'novel.Set', 'sometime', 'Supergirl', 'first', 'arrived', 'Earth', 'Superman', 'strange', 'alien', 'android', 'defeating', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'Supergirl', 'remembering', 'how', 'city', 'Kandor', 'Krypton', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'powerful', 'invader', 'known', 'Brainiac', 'Fearing', 'Earth', 'might', 'attacked', 'Brainiac', 'Superman', 'out', 'space', 'hunt', 'stopping', 'destroying', 'world', 'Supes', 'taken', 'aboard', 'Brainy', 'giant', 'skulltopus', 'ship', 'face-to-face', 'Martian', 'Manhunter-lookalike', 'Brainiac', 'Superman', 'down', 'now', 'bottle', 'city', 'Kandor', 'Supergirl', 'parents', 'Superman', 'get', 'big', 'again', 'Kandor', 'back', 'Earth', 'Brainiac', 'shrinks', 'Metropolis', 'Superman', 'Supergirl', 'team', 'up', 'stop', 'Brainiac', 'taking', 'dangers', 'ship', 'pulling', 'literally', 'down', 'Earth', 'Supers', 'overwhelm', 'Brainiac', 'being', 'exposed', 'elements', 'actual', 'thriving', 'world', 'instead', 'observing', 'little', 'bottled', 'cities', 'down', 'mad', 'computer', 'stinger', 'end', 'not', 'permanently.This', 'was', 'well', 'executed', 'animated', 'feature', 'definite', 'step', 'up', 'Superman', 'Vs', 'Elite', 'movie', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'animation', 'quality', 'were', 'things', 'were', 'left', 'original', 'story', 'Pa', 'Kent', 'death', 'ties', 'rest', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Also', 'Superman', 'Kandor', 'alien', 'planet', 'red', 'sun', 'instead', 'Earth', 'comic', 'whole', 'New', 'Krypton', 'story', 'arc', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'slight', 'sequel', 'Superman/Batman', 'Apocalypse', 'still', 'fresh', 'space', 'Supergirl', 'apparent', 'trying', 'be', 'own', 'entity', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', ""'re"", 'big', 'Superfan', 'also', 'good', 'sci-fi/superhero', 'movie', 'too']",N/A

The flight sequences involving the helicopters are janky and weird. In places, it's worse than 90s cartoons. The durability of the killer robots seemed inconsistent and puzzling. Sometimes he needs laser-vision to slice them up, sometimes he can break them up with his bare hands, and sometimes he can't.While it might be the fault of the source material upon which the movie is based, the plot trots along to a climax that is terribly deus ex machina and in no small part ""borrowed"" from the original War of the Worlds.Somehow, the movie even lacks dramatic weight. I thought Emerald Knights and Superman Doomsday had more gravity. It doesn't help either that Lois and Clark try to have 90s romantic sitcom in the middle of it all.

1624159,ABB1D44GETEOM,B00BBAQD6S,"J. Thomason ""SkyFitsJeff""","[11, 16]","Superman: Unbound is based on the graphic novel Superman: Brainiac by Geoff Johns. I've never been a fan of Johns work, because it is very prosaic and obvious with nothing new, original, or surprising thrown in. This movie is no different. This movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.Story: The story was pretty thin and weak. One scene did not flow into the next very well, and many times I wondered how Superman knew to go where he went next. Every ""surprise"" and ""reveal"" was obvious and easy to see coming. Nothing surprised me. The ending when Superman defeated Brainiac was unbelievable and anticlimactic, but not unexpected since they basically gave it away in the middle of the show.Characterizations: The character development was also week with characters going from one extreme to another rather easily (an angry, out-of-control Supergirl suddenly becomes understanding and in control for no real reason other than the plot required it). Brainiac is an uninteresting villain with no real motivation. Lois is obnoxious and unlikeable. Superman is very unsure of himself. The relationship between Lois and Clark seems very dysfunctional but magically resolves itself at the end with a proposal that just didn't fit.Voices: The voices were interesting, but as has been noted in other reviews, Matt Bomer is a very laconic Superman. He sounds laid back even when he should be bursting with emotion. And Brainiac sounds more like King Kong than a superintellegent alien computer.Action: The action is pretty well done and there is a lot of it. One thing that surprised me was the amount of gratuitous gore. We really didn't need to see so much blood and innards to get the point. They actually detracted.Politics: The antibullying message felt very forced and out of place. That's nice you want to speak out against bullying, but don't shoehorn it into a movie where it doesn't fit. It makes the message sound stupid, the opposite of what you want.Overall, if you're looking for a generic superhero flick with nothing that stands out, this will fit the bill. But if you want something exciting, something that will make you think, or something that is really entertaining, you're going to be disappointed.",3,Mediocre,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,2216,"['Superman', 'Unbound', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Superman', 'Brainiac', 'Geoff', 'Johns', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Johns', 'work', 'very', 'prosaic', 'obvious', 'nothing', 'new', 'original', 'surprising', 'thrown', 'movie', 'different', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'either.Story', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'thin', 'weak', 'One', 'scene', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'next', 'very', 'well', 'many', 'times', 'wondered', 'how', 'Superman', 'knew', 'go', 'where', 'went', 'next', 'surprise', 'reveal', 'was', 'obvious', 'easy', 'see', 'coming', 'Nothing', 'surprised', 'ending', 'when', 'Superman', 'defeated', 'Brainiac', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'anticlimactic', 'not', 'unexpected', 'basically', 'gave', 'away', 'middle', 'show.Characterizations', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'also', 'week', 'characters', 'going', 'one', 'extreme', 'rather', 'easily', 'angry', 'out-of-control', 'Supergirl', 'suddenly', 'understanding', 'control', 'real', 'reason', 'other', 'plot', 'required', 'Brainiac', 'uninteresting', 'villain', 'real', 'motivation', 'Lois', 'obnoxious', 'unlikeable', 'Superman', 'very', 'unsure', 'relationship', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'magically', 'end', 'proposal', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit.Voices', 'voices', 'were', 'interesting', 'been', 'noted', 'other', 'reviews', 'Matt', 'Bomer', 'very', 'laconic', 'Superman', 'laid', 'back', 'even', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'bursting', 'emotion', 'Brainiac', 'more', 'King', 'Kong', 'superintellegent', 'alien', 'computer.Action', 'action', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'lot', 'One', 'thing', 'surprised', 'was', 'amount', 'gratuitous', 'gore', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'blood', 'innards', 'get', 'point', 'actually', 'detracted.Politics', 'antibullying', 'message', 'felt', 'very', 'forced', 'place', 'nice', 'want', 'speak', 'out', 'bullying', 'do', ""n't"", 'shoehorn', 'movie', 'where', ""n't"", 'fit', 'message', 'sound', 'stupid', 'opposite', 'what', 'want.Overall', ""'re"", 'looking', 'generic', 'superhero', 'flick', 'nothing', 'out', 'will', 'fit', 'bill', 'want', 'something', 'exciting', 'something', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'something', 'really', 'entertaining', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

1624186,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B00BBAQD6S,NF,"[1, 1]","I have not read the original Superman issues on which this movie was based so this will be a review of just what's in the movie. Generally speaking, I'm a fan of the Warner Bros. DCU animation, going back to the original Batman animated series. This movie, though, was a bit of a letdown.In this retelling of the Brainiac origin, Brainiac begins as a resident of Colu (homeworld of Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super Heroes). He has essentially turned himself into a cyborg and is on a quest for ultimate knowledge. As with the original Brainiac origin, this version of Brainiac vacuums up knowledge from worlds, saves the people he deems worthy of saving, then destroys the planet. He has taken Kandor, as well, along with Supergirl's parents. Also in this version, Brainiac is super-strong and nearly invulnerable.Superman's first exposure to Brainiac occurs when a near-indestructible robot lands on Earth and he has to destroy it. A young and terrified Supergirl recognizes the robot and explains that she last saw those very same robots decimating Kandor. Worried about the threat and wondering whether Kandor might have been preserved, Superman tracks the robot back to its source and attacks Brainiac's ship and robots as they destroy another world.Superman is captured in the battle but then disables Brainiac and his ship and flees with the shrunken bottle city of Kandor. Unfortunately, Brainiac quickly recovers and manages to track Superman back to Earth, where he attacks Metropolis. The ending is fairly interesting but, frankly, there are gaping plot holes there, as I can think of several reasons why it shouldn't have happened that way.So how does this hold up? The animation is decent, about on par with the other Superman movies. They definitely went with a different look for Superman, as his face is longer and thinner. He's still got the muscles, though. Brainiac comes across as brutish and hulking, not the more cerebral version we've seen in the Superman and Justice League television series.The voice acting, too, is decent, with Matt Bomer as Superman and John Noble as Brainiac. Noble's voice, in particular, is a good fit for the revised Brainiac. It's a bit over the top but that's forgivable in a movie of this type.Where the movie falls short a bit is in the story itself. Basically, Superman gets captured, then gains heart and punches his way out. Lather, rinse, repeat... And, as I said, the final outcome just didn't work for me. I expect more from this crew, based on their track record, This is one of their less successful efforts.",3,Just okay,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,2569,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'original', 'Superman', 'issues', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'review', 'just', 'what', 'movie', 'Generally', 'speaking', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'DCU', 'animation', 'going', 'back', 'original', 'Batman', 'animated', 'series', 'movie', 'though', 'was', 'bit', 'letdown.In', 'retelling', 'Brainiac', 'origin', 'Brainiac', 'resident', 'Colu', 'homeworld', 'Brainiac', '5', 'Legion', 'Super', 'Heroes', 'essentially', 'turned', 'cyborg', 'quest', 'ultimate', 'knowledge', 'original', 'Brainiac', 'origin', 'version', 'Brainiac', 'vacuums', 'up', 'knowledge', 'worlds', 'people', 'worthy', 'saving', 'then', 'planet', 'taken', 'Kandor', 'as', 'well', 'Supergirl', 'parents', 'Also', 'version', 'Brainiac', 'super-strong', 'nearly', 'invulnerable.Superman', 'first', 'exposure', 'Brainiac', 'when', 'near-indestructible', 'robot', 'lands', 'Earth', 'destroy', 'young', 'terrified', 'Supergirl', 'robot', 'last', 'saw', 'very', 'same', 'robots', 'decimating', 'Kandor', 'Worried', 'threat', 'wondering', 'Kandor', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'preserved', 'Superman', 'robot', 'back', 'source', 'Brainiac', 'ship', 'robots', 'destroy', 'world.Superman', 'captured', 'battle', 'then', 'Brainiac', 'ship', 'flees', 'shrunken', 'bottle', 'city', 'Kandor', 'Unfortunately', 'Brainiac', 'quickly', 'recovers', 'manages', 'track', 'Superman', 'back', 'Earth', 'where', 'Metropolis', 'ending', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'frankly', 'are', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'there', 'can', 'think', 'several', 'reasons', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'happened', 'how', 'hold', 'up', 'animation', 'decent', 'about', 'par', 'other', 'Superman', 'movies', 'definitely', 'went', 'different', 'look', 'Superman', 'face', 'longer', 'thinner', 'still', 'got', 'muscles', 'though', 'Brainiac', 'brutish', 'hulking', 'not', 'more', 'cerebral', 'version', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Superman', 'Justice', 'League', 'television', 'series.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'too', 'decent', 'Matt', 'Bomer', 'Superman', 'John', 'Noble', 'Brainiac', 'Noble', 'voice', 'particular', 'good', 'fit', 'revised', 'Brainiac', 'bit', 'top', 'forgivable', 'movie', 'movie', 'short', 'bit', 'story', 'Basically', 'Superman', 'captured', 'then', 'gains', 'heart', 'punches', 'way', 'Lather', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'said', 'final', 'outcome', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'expect', 'more', 'crew', 'based', 'track', 'record', 'one', 'less', 'successful', 'efforts']",N/A

Man, what a difference.Start with thisSuperman: Brainiac.  Now, remove all the dialogue and make up your own.  Add a 10 minute fight scene at the beginning of the movie with Superman and Supergirl vs some generic human villains.  Add another 10 minute scene with Superman inside the bottled city of Kandor, remove the tragedy at the end and replace it with a nice upbeat ending, and you'll end up with this film.Some of the changes I can understand, for example, the film has this be the first time Superman meets Brainiac.  This makes explaining the very messy Post-Crisis back history unnecessary.  But taking out all the original dialogue removes this exchange:Supergirl: Thanks, Ma'am.  (Catherine Grant tugs on Supergirl's cape)  Hey.Cat: My name is not ""Ma'am""--Supergirl: It's not like I called you an old woman or anything, lady...Well, that's strange.Cat: What's strange?(Supergirl stares at Cat's chest.)Supergirl: My X-Ray vision is picking up some strange plastics in your--Lois: Supergirl!  There you are...Supergirl (later, to Lois): I think that lady needs to see a doctor--Lois: Don't say anything else.  You don't want to antagonize HER.Supergirl: But--Lois: Just smile and say ""bye.""Supergirl: Bye.Catherine Grant doesn't get any dialogue in the film, so this whole scene is cut.The comics had much better art, dialogue, and story.

While I think the animation style was rather clean, Lois Lane had very evil looking eyes, and Superman...well he looked like Elvis. I wasn't fond of the Superman vs the Elites design either, but in the Elites case, I found the story rather compelling. I can't say I found the story to be as compelling. One of the other issues I had was the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois. Some parts were amusing, but it felt like the chemistry of why these two belong together was off. I found Lois rather irritating and overly selfish and at times she used Kent without any care. If you look at their relationship in other DC animations like All Stars and Elites, the chemistry was there and even seeing the characters at their core and understood why they belong. Here Lois, seems she takes advantage of Superman's powers and it was all about ""her her her"" Ironically when the ending came about, I only was happy because I like those two characters together, than this movie setting the stage as to why these characters need to be together.Of course that's just the romance angle. The storyline with Brainiac and Supergirl were still downplayed. I did like the design of Braniac, but there just wasn't a good emotional urgency or meaning to this storyline. I do admit there were times that I winced due to some of the violence, but there was just something that didn't make you connect to the story very well. I'm also not going to lie and there were some good fight scene moments between Brainiac and Superman.If I were to Rank this in line with the other DC movies primarily featuring Superman from best to least It would be as followsSuperman/Batman Public EnemiesAll Star SupermanSuperman vs the ElitesSuperman/ShazamSuperman/Batman: ApocalypseSuperman DoomsdaySuperman Unbound",3,Super Elvis tries coming to an average rescue,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,1897,"['have', 'say', 'rather', 'average', 'run', 'DC', 'Animated', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'problems', 'think', 'animation', 'style', 'was', 'rather', 'clean', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'had', 'very', 'evil', 'looking', 'eyes', 'Superman', 'well', 'looked', 'Elvis', 'was', ""n't"", 'fond', 'Superman', 'Elites', 'design', 'either', 'Elites', 'case', 'found', 'story', 'rather', 'compelling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'compelling', 'One', 'other', 'issues', 'had', 'was', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Lois', 'parts', 'were', 'amusing', 'felt', 'chemistry', 'why', 'two', 'belong', 'together', 'was', 'found', 'Lois', 'rather', 'irritating', 'overly', 'selfish', 'times', 'used', 'Kent', 'care', 'look', 'relationship', 'other', 'DC', 'animations', 'Stars', 'Elites', 'chemistry', 'was', 'even', 'seeing', 'characters', 'core', 'understood', 'why', 'belong', 'Here', 'Lois', 'advantage', 'Superman', 'powers', 'was', 'her', 'Ironically', 'when', 'ending', 'came', 'only', 'was', 'happy', 'like', 'two', 'characters', 'together', 'movie', 'setting', 'stage', 'why', 'characters', 'need', 'be', 'together.Of', 'course', 'just', 'romance', 'angle', 'storyline', 'Brainiac', 'Supergirl', 'were', 'still', 'downplayed', 'did', 'design', 'Braniac', 'there', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'emotional', 'urgency', 'meaning', 'storyline', 'do', 'admit', 'were', 'times', 'winced', 'due', 'violence', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'connect', 'story', 'very', 'well', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'going', 'lie', 'were', 'good', 'fight', 'scene', 'moments', 'Brainiac', 'Superman.If', 'were', 'Rank', 'line', 'other', 'DC', 'movies', 'primarily', 'featuring', 'Superman', 'best', 'least', 'would', 'be', 'followsSuperman/Batman', 'Public', 'EnemiesAll', 'Star', 'SupermanSuperman', 'vs', 'ElitesSuperman/ShazamSuperman/Batman', 'ApocalypseSuperman', 'DoomsdaySuperman', 'Unbound']",N/A

I'm thinking here of shows like Batman: The Animated Series, Mask of The Phantasm, Justice League, and of course, Justice League Unlimited.This offering isn't quite up to the standard of that earlier epoch at its absolute best. But it is at least as good as the original DCAU Superman: The Animated Series, and it's certainly a noticeable improvement on any of the feature length animated productions DC has been offering us lately. There's significantly more depth to the characters than we've seen in quite a while, even if at times the psychological aspects feel a little tacked on.It hardly needs be said that the music, visuals, and general production values are superb. But then, that's something we've simply come to expect from Warner Bros/DC collaborations.Another area though where more mature viewers may feel the film is a bit wanting is in the lack of moral depth. This is, ultimately, a story with a baddie who is purely and simply bad, and who needs to be smacked down hard. Superman: Unbound does not even attempt to approach the depth of more complex and nuanced works such as Justice League Unlimited or Mask of The Phantasm; or, on a more recent note, Young Justice.Those are all superhero cartoons I would encourage even grown-ups with no preexisting interest in the genre to watch and consider. I believe they're good enough to convince any fundamentally open minded person that superhero cartoons can be, and sometimes are, intelligent and thoughtful works.Superman: Unbound does not achieve that standard.It is, on the other hand, a film I would unhesitatingly recommend to any fan who does already love the genre.

1624208,A277UC8WJVAIIE,B00BBAQD6S,The Wiz,"[13, 19]","It's difficult to say if Superman Unbound is attempting to maintain continuity with previous DC animated films, they do after all fall on either side of the New 52 comic, franchise reboot.The Story:  Superman confronts Brainiac for the first time while Supergirl struggles to deal with being a superhero...  relatively simple but nevertheless engaging.The Look:  Warner Bros. Animation Studios has developed a unique look in traditional animation for their DC series of films and this latest installment represents a definite step forward in that evolution.  Although overall, the artwork for both characters and scenery looks great, I really wish they'd stop tweaking the heroes themselves because I thought Superman and Supergirl were perfect in ""Superman/Batman Apocalypse"".  Visually, my impression of Supergirl is petite, Bratz doll and Superman (from the neck up) looks an awful lot like Colin Morgan from the BBC series Merlin, but at least they didn't use his New 52 plate armor.  Also, for some reason they decided to make Lois Lane look a bit like Margot Kidder from the 80's, live-action franchise; although admittedly Margot never looked so good but the end effect is something approaching a sexy Cruella Deville and just doesn't seem to really fit the character.  Brainiac however, looks absolutely phenomenal; he embodies intelligent super-villain and a legitimate threat for Superman not to mention his cybernetic henchies rock.The Script:  As with all the DC feature-length, animated films the voice-acting is superb but it just feels like the studio can't quite take the genre serious enough to give the actual dialogue a bit more depth.  For me, this is where Superman Unlimited fails (and why I'm subtracting one star) as it's inundated with a host of typical, action-movie clich&eacute;s and almost adolescent interchanges between characters.  Also for some inexplicable reason, they decided to go with angry teenager for Supergirl's personality which is at best an unappealing fictional persona and then there's the character Lombard who struck me as something straight out of Looney Tunes (I REALLY hope they deep-6 him for future films).Superman has always been my favorite hero and as long as he remains a champion of truth and justice, always will be and so I'm grateful this story follows the overall tenor of the franchise, being typically optimistic and conservatively heroic as opposed to the exploration into moral ambiguity of ""Rise of the Imperfects"" or the antithetical fantasies of ""Injustice: Gods Among Us"".  Even with its faults, Superman Unbound reaffirms my love for the DC superhero universe and I can definitely see myself watching this one again. :o)",4,Welcome Addition to DC Film Collection,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,2692,"['difficult', 'say', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'attempting', 'maintain', 'continuity', 'previous', 'DC', 'animated', 'films', 'do', 'fall', 'side', 'New', '52', 'comic', 'franchise', 'reboot.The', 'Story', 'Superman', 'confronts', 'Brainiac', 'first', 'time', 'Supergirl', 'deal', 'being', 'superhero', 'relatively', 'simple', 'nevertheless', 'engaging.The', 'Look', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Animation', 'Studios', 'developed', 'unique', 'look', 'traditional', 'animation', 'DC', 'series', 'films', 'latest', 'installment', 'definite', 'step', 'forward', 'evolution', 'overall', 'artwork', 'characters', 'scenery', 'great', 'really', 'wish', ""'d"", 'stop', 'tweaking', 'heroes', 'thought', 'Superman', 'Supergirl', 'were', 'perfect', 'Superman/Batman', 'Apocalypse', 'Visually', 'impression', 'Supergirl', 'petite', 'Bratz', 'doll', 'Superman', 'neck', 'up', 'awful', 'lot', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'BBC', 'series', 'Merlin', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'New', '52', 'plate', 'armor', 'Also', 'reason', 'decided', 'make', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'look', 'bit', 'Margot', 'Kidder', '80', 'live-action', 'franchise', 'admittedly', 'Margot', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'good', 'end', 'effect', 'something', 'approaching', 'sexy', 'Cruella', 'Deville', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'fit', 'character', 'Brainiac', 'however', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'intelligent', 'super-villain', 'legitimate', 'threat', 'Superman', 'not', 'mention', 'cybernetic', 'henchies', 'rock.The', 'Script', 'DC', 'feature-length', 'animated', 'films', 'voice-acting', 'superb', 'just', 'feels', 'studio', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'take', 'genre', 'serious', 'enough', 'give', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'where', 'Superman', 'Unlimited', 'fails', 'why', ""'m"", 'subtracting', 'one', 'star', 'inundated', 'host', 'typical', 'action-movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'almost', 'adolescent', 'interchanges', 'characters', 'Also', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'decided', 'go', 'angry', 'teenager', 'Supergirl', 'personality', 'best', 'unappealing', 'fictional', 'persona', 'then', 'character', 'Lombard', 'who', 'struck', 'something', 'straight', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'REALLY', 'hope', 'deep-6', 'future', 'films', '.Superman', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'hero', 'as', 'long', 'champion', 'truth', 'justice', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'so', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'story', 'overall', 'tenor', 'franchise', 'being', 'typically', 'optimistic', 'conservatively', 'heroic', 'opposed', 'exploration', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'Rise', 'Imperfects', 'antithetical', 'fantasies', 'Injustice', 'Gods', 'Us', 'Even', 'faults', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'love', 'DC', 'superhero', 'universe', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'watching', 'one', 'again', 'o']",N/A

With that, we were given the latest film 'Superman Unbound'. At first I was a little upset that for a bit these films have been focusing on Superman and Batman, but I still have yet to be disappointed by one of these films. I think it was because of the low expectations that I got one of the most original Superman films to date.Once again, we get a film taken from comic source material and like 'All Star Superman' this new film gives us a whole new dimension of Superman. Superman is the all around good guy as always, but we see new sides to his heart and how he deals with life love and family. The supporting cast of Lois, and regular crew is always great, and once again seeing Supergirl also add more to the total film. This is the first time Braniac is featured and his character is definitely one that makes your skin crawl in his own views towards life and the film clearly shows just how opposite he and Superman are. The film also grabs from a lot of the Superman mythos that has not really been featured in the DCAU. Examples would be the lost city of Kandor and of course the famous metal skull head ship from the late 1970s early 1980s version of Brainiac. The voice cast is one of the best as always, using unknown will usually give you a great performance. John Bomer and Molly Quinn gave us a great Superman and Supergirl, but the somewhat known John Noble gave us a true heartless villain in Brainiac.This film is the dawning of a new age along with the stepping down of Bruce Timm from the DCAU film division. The fact that this film really focused on the person behind the costume makes me very eager to see what we will see in the future. Right now, it looks pretty promising with a new story with The Flash finally as a main character and the announcement of focusing on other heroes in future DCAU films.

The not so good? The story is rather disjointed. Superman himself is fundamentally dull, and not compelling at all. And Brainiac is just not interesting, and indeed, his motivation doesn't add up to much.

1624221,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B00BBAQD6S,Zack Davisson,"[4, 6]","One of the blessings and curses of Big Two superhero comics is continuity. If you are deep into it, continuity can be a lot of fun and keeps you coming back issue after issue. But if you are a casual reader--or someone who hasn't checked out a series for awhile--it can be confusing.Case in point: ""Superman: Unbound."" I haven't followed regular DC comics for years now, much less Superman. But I love these original animated movies. They're usually self-contained, not too ""meta"" and can be watched by a casual viewer. They don't have that high barrier of entry that most mainstream superhero comics have. But ""Superman: Unbound"" is set pretty firmly in some continuity, and that threw me for a loop at first.Let's see ... Superman hasn't met Brainiac yet (who seems to be some merger of ""green"" Brainiac and ""robot"" Brainiac); Lois Lane knows who Superman is, but her and Clark Kent's relationship is a secret; Supergirl is actually older than Superman, but somehow younger due to a wormhole ... huh.OK. Whatever. It's comic books, and I've been through enough ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" and ""52s"" to roll with the continuity changes. Just be aware that unlike many DC animated movies, ""Superman: Unbound"" expects you to know a little bit about modern Superman (Depending on your definition of modern. The comic this is based on,Superman: Brainiac, came out in 2008. Thanks internet!)The animation style also took me off guard at first. For reasons completely unknown to humanity, someone working on this thought it would be a good idea to model Superman after Woody fromToy Story, with a thin, lanky body and a cylindrical head. The other characters look great--Supergirl, Lois Lane, and Brainiac all look awesome--it's just Superman who looks like he wandered in from the wrong cartoon. This design choice is especially odd as I see the original comic was drawn by Gary Frank, who does amazing art. They should have just attempted to preserve his style.Storywise, ""Superman: Unbound"" is a typical Brainiac adventure. Brainiac shows up looking to do some knowledge/world collecting, Superman steps up to the plate to punch him in the face, loses for awhile, finds his hidden strength in his humanity to defeat Brainiac's cold, emotionless logic, recovers the Bottle City of Kandor and a whole world full of miniature Kryptonians.Even though I don't follow modern DC comics, I've been reading long enough that I have read this story before--a couple times at least. There's absolutely nothing new here, just a re-cast of the familiar, a new paint job and some pizzazz. I'm actually OK with that. The new paint is pretty, and there are a few interesting twists. I liked Supergirl as a petulant, vulnerable teenager.  She shouldn't be as ""pure"" as Superman, because she wasn't raised in the loving Kent's farm in Smallville.  She's tough without being a ""bad girl.""I thought the Brainiac update was great as well.  Merging the ""green"" and the ""robot"" was an inspired choice, making a scary character even more menacing. It was a good nod to the past and future of the Superman mythos. And the final scene--well, I'm not really buying that it would go down that way (I have a hard time thinking a living computer would be so freaked out by bugs), but it was clever enough.The Blu Ray has a decent collection of Bonus Features, about what I have come to expect by now from Warner Home Video.  There are two mini-documentaries on The Bottle City of Kandor and Brainiac that were both fun, but disappointing. Instead of really diving into the history of both, they really dwelt on their role in the story Superman: Unbound. I thought that was a bit of a waste--we've already bought this release, so you don't need to advertise it anymore. Give us some more depth. Tell us more about the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, all that good stuff.  That's the meat.As always, there are a few episodes from the Superman Animated show featuring the principal characters Supergirl and Brainiac. That's some nice added material if you don't already own the series.  I personally don't, so I appreciate the extra episodes.Watching the commercials, it looks like Flashpoint is up next for the DC animated treatment.  That's another comic that I have never read but have heard of.  I'll watch it for sure.
