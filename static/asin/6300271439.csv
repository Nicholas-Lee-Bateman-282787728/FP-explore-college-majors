237999,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6300271439,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 1]","Loudon Trott (Griffin Dunne) is a Manhattan Tax Attorney engaged to debutante Wendy Worthington. He is frantically preparing for the big wedding, but first he has to pick up a cat for eccentric millionaire Montgomery Bell, and Wendy's father commands him to make sure that a certain Nikki Finn (Madonna), who is being released from the slammer, gets on the bus and leaves town. Piece of cake. The project was undoubtedly pitched as an 80's update of the 30's comedies like Howard Hawks' 1938 Bringing Up Baby. Seems like a smart bet for a whacky screw ball comedy, but in hindsight you'll be asking: Is it possible for the producers to be any dumber?Who's that girl who ruined this movie? Madonna. While she actually won an ASCAP award for the title song, also nominated for a Grammy and a Golden Globe,  her acting won her a Razzie for worst performance, and Razzie nominations for worst film, worst script, worst director, and one of the other songs was nominated for worst song. The script was pretty bad, with enough holes to drive a UPS truck through--but mostly it was Madonna who's to blame. From the moment we first see her released from the slammer we know that she is going to stink, big time.------------Prison Officer: One black leather jacket, one plastic comb, blue, two studded leather bracelets, black, and one lipstick, fire engine red.Donovan: [sarcastically] All your worldly possessions.Nikki Finn: [speaking of the lipstick] Don't knock it, Donovan. You can't get this shade `a red anymore.==============If she had been left in the slammer instead of released, we might have had something. The Magic that was Madonna in the 80's just doesn't translate to the medium of film. ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" was a fluke that worked because it used her in very small doses essentially playing herself, but surprise, surprise, I guess it wasn't Sean Penn who was to blame for the failure of ""Shanghai Surprise"" after all. Penn was supposed to play the lead in this turkey also, but after seeing the rushes they shanghaied him--ditched him and hitched their wagon to Madonna's star. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Anyone could see that Penn had a one way ticket to Palooka Ville while Madonna was on Starlight Express.It seems her persona was meant to be a strange concoction of Betty Boop, Marilyn Monroe, and Mae West, with her own unique fashion sense--or maybe a punked out Judy Holliday--but on the big screen it just looked hideous. That is no beauty mark, Madonna, that is a mole, even if it was painted on. Her roots were showing--on purpose! Was that meant to be trashy but chic? Frida Kahlo called, and she wants her eyebrows back. I was aghast at how hideous Madonna looked and how badly she acted. Madonna has won 9 Razzies for worst actress, including 2000's uncoveted Worst Actress of the Century Razzie. She is truly in a league of her own. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?Veteran actor and Oscar winner Sir John Mills (Ryan's Daughter, 1970) lent the film a certain gravitas that it didn't deserve. As eccentric millionaire Montgomery Bell he sends Loudon Trott to the docks to pick up his cat. It turns out to be a rare and endangered breed of cougar that Trott totes around for most of the film. I couldn't understand what Sir John Mills' character was even doing in the movie, other than providing an excuse for Madonna to show that even if the movie success that Cher has garnered has thus far eluded her, she, not Cher, is the true Queen of the Cougars. Oh, well. Rule Number #1 of Screwball Comedies is fish gotta swim, and running gags gotta run:-----Cabbie #1: I didn't say I gave her a ride. I said I had her in the cab.=============Here the running gags don't so much as run, they take a cab--but where does it say running gags also have to gag?------------Cabbie #2: I had her in my cab once.=================The jury is still out on Griffin Dunne. He fed Madonna his straight lines well, but she invariably muffed the return. In one scene he is telling her that he was on the fencing team in college, but his father would never watch any of his matches.------------Nikki Finn: Why would your father wanna watch you turn over stolen goods? You're twisted!===============Touch&eacute;. NOT!Much better it was when Griffin Dunne had the punch line. Nikki Finn is trying to outrun a train at a crossing, and she exclaims that she thinks she can make it. He is oh so very deliciously droll and deadpan:----------Loudon Trott: I'll accept anything but a tie.=================I saw Griffin Dunne at a panel on producing independent films at San Francisco State University with a screening of ""After Hours"" (which he had just starred in and produced). ""After Hours"" was similar in some ways to ""Who's that Girl?"" Griffin played a Word Processor in over his head in the wild and whacky world the city becomes after hours. Kind of like a Tax Attorney thrust into the craziness of Nikki Finn's life. One was a successful independent film that showed you can accomplish a lot on a small budget with clever directing and writing, but the other was a big budget film, supposed to be a star vehicle for Madonna, with horrible writing and directing. After the ""After Hours"" screening Griffin Dunne mentioned an upcoming film project with Madonna. He was on that Merry Go Round, reaching for that brass ring...Little did Griffin know that after this debacle, his acting career would pretty much be Dunne.----------Wendy Worthington: Is it possible for you to be any dumber?Buck: I-I don't see how.==================The Great Buck Howard(2008) Griffin Dunne was Jonathan FinermanMarie and Bruce(2004) Griffin Dunne was Restaurant GuestSwept Away(2002) Madonna was AmberNaked in New York(1993) Griffin Dunne was AuditionerDick Tracy(1990) Madonna was Breathless MahoneyBloodhounds of Broadway(1989) Madonna was Hortense HathawayShanghai Surprise(1986) Madonna was Gloria TatlockDesperately Seeking Susan(1985) Madonna was SusanAfter Hours(1985) Griffin Dunne was Paul HackettDes Teufels Advokat (1977) John Mills was Blaise MeredithRyan's Daughter (Two-Disc Special Edition)(1970) John Mills was MichaelBritannia of Billingsgate (1933) John Mills was Fred Bolton------------Cabbie #3: Oh, hang on.

She then showed us that she has a true talent as an actress, where she starred in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) and Shanghai Surprise (1986). This spunky comedy is a must-have movie, where Madonna explores the depths of comedy.Madonna plays Nicole &quot;Nikki&quot; Finn, a free-spirited girl who enjoys life to the fullest extent. In 1983, Nikki was arrested for the murder of her boyfriend. However, Nikki did not committ the crime. Her boyfriend, Johnny, oversaw a particular meeting going on between an unidentified man and a pimp named Raoul. Johnny gets the goods on this guy: photos, tapes, etc. He locks all if that stuff in the indentified man's saftey deposit box and gives Nikki the key. The unidentified man hires Raoul and some fat guy to kill Johnny. The two put his corpse in the trunk of Nikki's car. She gets in the car, takes a red light and is pulled over. The cops open up her trunk, and there's Johnny's dead body. Four years later, Nikki is granted parolle.Griffen Dunne plays Loudon Trott, a tax attorney, who is one day from marrying the daughter, Wendy Worthington, of his boss, Mr. Worthington. His boss gets a call about Nikki being granted her parolle. She was asked to leave New York and take the bus to Philadelphia. Mr. Worthington wants Loudon to drive Nikki to the bus station and make sure she gets on the bus to Philly. Instead of letting him take her, Nikki takes Loudon on  wild goose chase to clear her name before she returns to Philly.

Complete with a zany variety of characters as well as a cougar (or known as a ""Patagolian Felix""), the film is a true screwball comedy and updates the classic ""Bringing Up Baby"" into the 1980'sThe movie was critically maligned from the moment it came out, but among Madonna fans, it was an instant cult classic.

I was intrigued why somebody would purchase at such an exhorbitant price a movie that was critically lambasted and had mixed commercial success.  Did I rush out to rent the film? Nah, the first I saw it was yesterday at home with my wife.  It's cheaper than seeing Madonna at her sold-out concert where tickets now are for a kings ransom.  Is this a funny movie?  For the most part, yes.  Does Madonna in her third feature film have the acting mustard to carry the load of a starring vehicle?  There's a few rough patches but the force of her personality compensates for any shortcomings.  Will it make you forget ""Bringing Up Baby""?  Definitely not but this is an analogy made by the film's critics.  The makers of the film have concocted a valentine to screwball comedies of yore and do not have the pretense to compare it with other films.

The zany screwball comedy has a huge cult following and fans of the film couldn't understand what the films DVD hold up was all about. Fear not, Who's That Girl has arrived.The film opens with a cute cartoon that plays over the opening credits. At the end of the credits Madonna is seen in jail. Madonna stars in the film as Nikki Finn. Nikki Finn has just spent four years in the slammer (Slammer was actually an early title used in relation to the film). Griffin Dunne stars in the film as Louden Trout. Louden is engaged to marry wealthy New York socialite Wendy Worthington. Wendy's father tasks his future son-in-law with picking up Nikki from the jail and taking her to the bus station. He tells them it's a program named ""Operation Prisoner Shuttle."" In addition to picking up Nikki he also has to transport a huge mystery package he soon finds out is a huge cat that happens to be on the endangered species list.Of course when he picks up Nikki from jail things don't go quite as planned. She is determined to clear her name. He just wants to finish his pre-wedding plans and other errands. Insanity ensues. From almost getting hit by a train, to a heart attack scare, shoplifting, big guns, and the two bad guys set to keep Nikki from clearing her name, the day Louden picks up Nikki Finn is a day he will never forget. Nikki and Louden are the most unlikely couple ever but when it's clear there is chemistry between the two. Will Nikki clear her name? Will Louden follow through with his wedding plans? Well if you haven't seen the movie you will have to wait and see to find out.The DVD doesn't include any fascinating bonus material.

Who's that Girl is a riot featuring Madonna as a recently released from prison screw ball blond that sets the big apple in an uproar as she tries to clear her name for a murder that she never committed.  Madonna seems to be at ease with this role and seems to go with her just fine when you compare it to some her more recent dismal roles in films like Four Rooms, Dick Tracy, A League of Her Own, the atrocious Evita, and even The Next Best Thing.  This film is an hour and a half of pure dumb comedy in which Madonna manages to give a reasonably decent and believable character and at times is even funny.  Even though this film was a flop at the box office, the film does entertain and especially if you are a fan of the Material Girl.

Mr. Worthington (Bibi Besch) doesn't want Nikki anywhere near his daughter Wendy's (Haviland Morris) wedding to Louden because he was the one who set her up to go to the big house!Nikki convinces Louden to stop at the mall because after all her mom thinks she's been shopping for the past four years so it wouldn't be very nice to come home empty handed. But Nikki has ulterior motives because she wants to ""cleah my name"" and prove to everyone that she was set up.It's now a race to see if Nikki can con Louden into helping her. Along the way they fall in love. But Louden is an uptight boy from Scarsdale who has reservations about a kooky girl from Philly.But, Nikki gets to Louden's wedding and stops the preacher in mid-sentence so that she can tell everyone that Mr. Worthington set her up. She also informs everyone that Louden is really in love with her, and this time he has the backbone to fight for her.

Unfortunately, the film was ignored by critics and audiences alike upon its release in the summer of 1987. This was one of Madonna's best  periods. She wrote four outstanding songs for the soundtrack that would  also be ignored by Madonna, herself, in later years. &quot;Who's That  Girl&quot; and &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot; reached No.1 and No.2,  respectively, but they weren't to be found on THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION.  &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; meanwhile, has stood the test of time as one  of her most achingly beautiful ballads, yet she FORGOT to include it on her  ballads collection, SOMETHING TO REMEMBER. Go figure. The picture itself is  a noisy screwball comedy that is hysterically funny. One of the best lines  in the film (and there are many great ones) is &quot;What's the patient's  name?&quot;  &quot;Loudon.&quot;  &quot;Loudon what?&quot;  &quot;Clear.&quot; LOL.

Madonna really shows off her charm,personailty, comidic abilites and is just awesome. whenever im down i always watch this cause madonna just makes me smile and makes me feel so much better. the only flaw i think is that all the other actors are over acting or cant keep up with madonna;s performance but they try really hard. I mean it is kinda hard to top this hysterical performance.Madonna plays an Ex-con Named Niki Finn who has just been recently placed on parole for the murder of her ex lover who she didnt kill and is &quot;suppose&quot; to go back to her home town of philadelphia. Of course she doesnt get there. Enter rich Manhatan Lawyer Louden Trott(Griffith Dunne) Who is assigned by his soon to be father in law to take niki to the bus stop. instead, there is a non stop wild ride with niki, an exstinct Patagonian felis concore, which louden is suppose to return, And a pimp and a fat man(who killed nikis boyfriend) who follow them, and loudens fiance Wendy(the funny Haviland Morris)and you have a hysterical wild ride and a race against time so niki can clear her name and tell louden she loves him before he gets married. Madonna really carries this movie and has a field day with her character. if you just want a fun night at home and alot of laughter rent or buy this movie. its a must for any madonna fan or any funny comedy's just to warn yall this is a very silly movie. so if you like these kind of movies its a must.",3,Madonna's Funniest movie,1003017600,"10 14, 2001",2001,1816,"['Well', 'first', 'wan', 'say', ""'m"", 'HUGE', 'Madonna', 'Fan', 'yes', 'know', 'made', 'terrible', 'bombs', 'decent', 'flicks', 'movie', 'got', 'swapmed', 'box', 'office', 'trashed', 'critics', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'Madonna', 'Hysterical', 'i', 'quite', 'frankly', 'think', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'then', 'desperatly', 'seaking', 'susan', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'Madonna', 'really', 'charm', 'personailty', 'comidic', 'abilites', 'just', 'awesome', 'whenever', 'im', 'down', 'i', 'always', 'watch', 'cause', 'madonna', 'just', 'smile', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'only', 'flaw', 'i', 'think', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'acting', 'cant', 'keep', 'up', 'madonna', 's', 'performance', 'try', 'really', 'hard', 'mean', 'kinda', 'hard', 'top', 'hysterical', 'performance.Madonna', 'Ex-con', 'Named', 'Niki', 'Finn', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'recently', 'placed', 'parole', 'murder', 'ex', 'lover', 'who', 'didnt', 'kill', 'quot', 'quot', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'philadelphia', 'course', 'get', 'there', 'Enter', 'rich', 'Manhatan', 'Lawyer', 'Louden', 'Trott', 'Griffith', 'Dunne', 'Who', 'assigned', 'soon', 'be', 'father', 'law', 'take', 'niki', 'bus', 'stop', 'instead', 'non', 'stop', 'wild', 'ride', 'niki', 'exstinct', 'Patagonian', 'felis', 'concore', 'suppose', 'return', 'pimp', 'fat', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'nikis', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'follow', 'fiance', 'Wendy', 'funny', 'Haviland', 'Morris', 'have', 'hysterical', 'wild', 'ride', 'race', 'time', 'niki', 'can', 'clear', 'name', 'tell', 'louden', 'married', 'Madonna', 'really', 'movie', 'field', 'day', 'character', 'just', 'want', 'fun', 'night', 'home', 'alot', 'laughter', 'rent', 'buy', 'movie', 'must', 'madonna', 'fan', 'funny', 'comedy', 'just', 'warn', 'yall', 'very', 'silly', 'movie', 'so', 'like', 'kind', 'movies', 'must']",N/A

There are inconsistencies in the film, such as the story taking place in New York, but when they go to a hospital, it is the hospital in Woodland Hills, CA.

I was expecting maybe a decent movie predominantly featuring Madonna's 4 songs from the soundtrack and a laid back script that probably wouldn't make much sense. Well, the plot did NOT make sense, but to be fair, it didn't make sense in classic 80's fashion. What we have here is arguably one of the best comedies of the late 80's. (I read another person's review of this where they said Desperately Seeking Susan was a better movie but not as funny. I agree. DSS was slightly better, but not nearly as funny.) Of course, this movie is much more Madonna than DSS was. Griffen Dunne is priceless as a young, engaged lawyer trying to keep Nikki (Madonna) in line as a favor for his fiance's father. No matter what he does he does not succeed. It's bad enough that he also has to pick up a rare species of panther, his fiance's father's &quot;pet&quot;. When Nikki leaves prison, he tries to take control of her and make sure she gets on the bus to Philadelphia as planned. Before he knows it, she is driving his in laws' car, or rather body-slamming it through suburban traffic. She also boosts tapes from a mall (you get a glimpse of longbox CDs in there) and gets a man arrested just so she can do so. By the end of the day...so much 80's-esque zany comedic situation has occurred you won't believe it. You won't be able to stop laughing, especially when they are chasing a UPS man in hot pursuit of a priceless necklace WHILE being chased by 2 men they thought they ditched who have a rift with Nikki. Just hilarious, and then, the next day, Dunne's wedding day. You can imagine!
