Willard ""lover of beauty""","[0, 0]","I bought this because one of my VERY favorite actors (Reiley McClendon) was in it; but I was both entertained and blessed by it.  It's about a Christian couple who helps troubled young people & the relationships among them all.  I recommend this to anyone interested in troubled youngsters and how to properly witness to them.  I've got to add:  if you've seen Reiley as a child actor, such as L&O: SVU, Logan & Lindsay, you may not recognize him.  He grew up! (6'2&#34;)  And very nicely, too, as talented as ever.

1291127,ABC8FXLD7W528,B002V0B0PG,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[2, 2]","""Safe Harbor"" is the true story about an amazing couple, Doug and Robbie Smith, who found a ministry to take in troubled teenage boys. Their ministry came by accident.  It wasn't Doug and Robbie's intention to help the boys, who would otherwise spend time in prison.  They had quite different plans after retiring - to take a cruise in their boat and spend their days relaxing at sea.Approached by a judge in their town, who asked the couple to take in three boys, the Smiths found it difficult to deny the judge's request.  After all, it was this same judge who gave Doug another chance years ago when he himself was a troubled teen.Cramming everyone into the tight living quarters of their small boat, Doug and Robbie devote their time to nurturing and guiding the boys who come from a variety of troubled backgrounds.  It isn't easy, and at times the Smiths wonder if they've made the right choice. However, they never give up hope that they can truly make a difference in the lives of those who need them most.This was an excellent movie of hope, second chances, and sacrifice. There are two minor swear words and viewers are shown the sad reality of severely dysfunctional homes and the result such homes had on the teenage boys. Due to some thematic elements including an attempted suicide, I would recommend this movie for those ages 12 and older.My favorite thing about this movie is that it's based on a true story. The Smiths are a phenomenal couple, and I enjoyed seeing the real-life Doug and Robbie during the CBN bonus feature at the end of the movie.  This movie will warm your heart and I highly recommend it.
