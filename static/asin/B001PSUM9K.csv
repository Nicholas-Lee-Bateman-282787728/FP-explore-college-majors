1229778,A3KZTEUNNB20OY,B001PSUM9K,book lover,"[5, 5]","One sign of a good TV series is whether or not you actually come to care about the characters.  On that score, at least for me, this show succeeds.  ""The Rez"" is based loosely on the 1994 movie ""Dance Me Outside"" which came out about two years before the series (the movie and series are old news already, but I only learned about them in the last year).  The role of Frank Fencepost, originally played by Adam Beach, is here played by Darrell Dennis.  However, Beach joins the series for a few episodes (playing a different character) during the latter half of this short-lived show -- there were only 19 episodes.  There are some other changes too from the movie, but two of the main characters, played by Ryan Black and Jennifer Podemski, remain the same.  Okay, enough on that.  The show started off not taking itself too seriously, just a (silly) good time.  But as it progressed, some of the story-lines took on a more serious tone (without, thankfully, ever taking itself too seriously).  I think the acting was very good, particularly Ryan Black, who really shines here (but everyone was really good, just a little something extra good about Ryan).  Listen, I'm just a white guy from the city, and have no idea what it is like to live on an Indian reservation in Canada (or anywhere), so I can't speak to its authenticity, but the show certainly kept me entertained.  I not only recommend the series, but the movie, Dance Me Outside, too.  The way the series ended, I get the feeling that the writers and actors knew it was over (of course, that's just a guess on my part).  I would love to see a followup TV movie to learn what became of these characters as some of them had dreams they were pursuing.
