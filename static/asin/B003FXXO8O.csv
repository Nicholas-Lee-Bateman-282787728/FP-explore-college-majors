1344823,A2WB4OWBUH2VQX,B003FXXO8O,"HardyBoy64 ""RLC""","[12, 12]","This concert is AMAZING on so many levels:1) The voices! Just gorgeous voices. Each has a solo song, and the group sings the rest. MANY cold chills during their performances. This group is really great at being loud and voluminous when needed, and soft and emotive when needed. In my opinion, this differentiates them from Il Divo, who in my opinion have similar vocal talent but they don't emote as well and songs often come across as simply bombastic. This is not the case with the Canadian Tenors!2) The Musicianship! Great band and orchestra! I really loved the songs with the accoustic guitar.3) Variety of song selection! Such a great selection of songs. The Canadian folk song was one of my favorites. Songs in Italian, French (I love BELLE), Spanish, English, etc.4) We get to see the fun personalities of the singers. They are comfortable on stage and present themselves with a humility that is refreshing. They are both professional and personable.The DVD, however, is not perfect. During some songs, the sound seems a bit muffled, as if the microphones needed to be turned up or the orchestra needed to play softer. This is not a big enough problem to subtract a star from my rating.

I have to admit I had pretty much lost my ""faith"" and was extremely angry that God would take her.  With much support from minister and friends I tried to heal.When I heard these amazing tenors (thanks to my niece who sent me the DVD) I noticed a line in the song ""Home I'll Be"" which states ""Never let the hard times take away your soul"", and I thought about that A LOT.  Of course the song ""Always There"" provided further thought and, thus, further healing, because it explains situations where we are ""down"" and You are always there.I now have renewed hope for return to normalcy a lot in part to these fantastic singers.  (I am so glad they enunciate so we can understand their words.)  Four entirely different types of voices, but they blend so well.
