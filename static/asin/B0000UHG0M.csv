784022,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000UHG0M,Grady Harp,"[17, 17]","La Classe de neige (CLASS TRIP) is terrifying little film that sweeps the viewer into a world so altered by a child's viewpoint that finding the story is a detective game - and a fine one at that!  Director Claude Miller adapted Emmanuel Carr&egrave;re's novella by the same name and out of this tale of 'everyday macabre' he has created a horror film that stands along with 'Diabolique' as pinnacles of French cinema.Nicolas (Cl&eacute;ment van den Bergh) is young, enuretic son of overbearing parents (Father Franois Roy and mother Tina Sportolaro) who is denied the companionship of his classmates on a bus trip to a ski resort by the father's insistence on driving him in his car.  Nicolas is a loner, a child who has many phobias, and who (we learn) has been exposed to many 'strange' situations. His father is a traveling saleman of prostheses, samples of which he keeps in his trunk. This arrogant father has at times been abusive, and at time coldly hostile, but he is the only person with whom Nicolas can relate.Once at camp Nicolas discovers his father departed before unloading Nicolas' suitcase.  The kindly school teachers Miss Grimm (think of the fairy tales!) Emmanuelle Bercot and Patrick (Yves Verhoeven) help Nicolas adjust and the class ruffian Hodkann (Lokman Nalcakan) not only loans him pajamas but befriends Nicolas in other ways.  Nicolas confides to Hodkann his father's strange occupation and soon the two exchange many stories that intertwine.  When a child near the ski resort is found dead, rumors abound about  bizarre men who kidnap young children in order to remove their organs for the transplant black market.  Nicolas has nightmares which include invaders to the class trip, memories of his father, prostheses becoming body parts, etc and one night as he tries to correct the results of his bedwetting, he gazes out the window at the first snow, walks into the snow locking himself out, and is discovered the next day in Patrick's car (yet another source of future nightmares).Nicolas and Hodkann bond and attempt to solve the mystery of the dead child and this adventure leads to some terrifying events - and we never know which of the tales is true and which is the product of Nicolas' fragile, twisted  mind.  Suffice it to say that the ending is disturbing and leaves the viewer with the fear to turn out the lights!The cast is superb, the musical score as composed by Henri Texier with a lot of help from movements from the Rossini 'Petite Messe Solennelle', and the cinematography by Guillaume Schiffman is extraordinary, moving smoothly and frighteningly between imagined incidents and reality.  This is a fine study of the fragile and fractured mind of a child and the elements that are both the etiology and the sequelae to delusional thinking.  Highly Recommended.

Although his teachers are supportive, Nicolas is withdrawn.  He gradually develops a friendship with fellow student Hodkann (played by Lokman Nalcakan).  Nicolas seems consumed with shocking memories, or are they wild fantasies?  Artificial limbs, children abducted for organ harvesting, paramilitary attacks on the school, freezing to death in a car, his own funeral, missing children, hostile fathers, and monkey paws granting wishes all make appearances.  Nicolas quietly tells Hodkann and some others parts of the story.  What is true and what is not?  What to do about it?  The suspense builds quite masterfully to a satisfying conclusion.While this film seems to be marketed as a gay film, it is really a thriller.  Nicolas may have a mild crush on Hodkann, but it doesn't go further than that.

784024,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B0000UHG0M,J. Martin,"[2, 2]","I agree with most other reviewers in liking this movie, but I disagree with almost everything they say about it. First of all, it is not hard to follow, nor is it at all hard to tell what is real and what is not. The plot is actually fairly simple, and warning that it is so complex that you have to watch it twice and answer half a dozen or more convoluted questions before you get it is absurd.It's also absurd to imply that you have to understand Freudian psychobabble to understand this movie. I don't know why people think they have to make a movie sound so hard to watch when it is not hard to watch at all.I also disagree that this is a sad, solemn movie, and that there's no humor in it. The humor is dark humor (very dark), but there's a good bit of it, as when Nicolas imagines making out with the teacher and when the hooded terrorists swarm over the school mowing everybody down with machine guns while Nicolas calmly eats food the other kids have left behind in panic. Even the scars the camera zooms in on so often and Nic's father's antics and horror stories about organ pirates are funny. It's macabre, but it's very funny.And the twist at the end? What twist? The end was obvious almost from the beginning of the movie. This is a movie, not a psychology test or an inscrutable riddle or even much of a thriller. It's a very smart, very dark comedy about children and crazy parents. In trying to over-analyze it, people miss its fun.

Child actor Clement Van Den Bergh appears to be on valium throughout the film and displays a kind of passionless zero interest in the events and things going on around him. The film is incomprehensible and just a total mixed up mess, as if someone cut all the scenes out separately, jumbled them up and stuck them back together again in any old order. I couldn't make head nor tail of it. I stuck with it to the end just so I could see if it might get any better...it didn't. It's hard to see how talented (or talentless) the actors and actresses are, because the script they are given to work with is banal in the extreme. Which are the fantasy and dream sequences and which are the reality ones? Your guess is as good as mine. I've never heard of the director, Claude Miller, but whoever he is, he's no Carol Reed or Julian Duvivier. I see the film won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Well, I suppose they had to give the prize to some film that year, but if this load of junk was given a prize, just think how awful were the ones that didn't win.

Perez ""RAP""","[0, 5]","La Classe de Neige is supposed to be a Picture This production, however, Warner Bros. comes out in the credits in the beginning of the movie. This is one very strange movie reminding me of something out the French Impressionism period.I don't even know where to begin to describe this plot as reality and fantasy becomes one, making everything surreal and difficult to understand. I am not even sure what the story is about but it surrounds one boy, Nicolas, who is brought by his father to a kid's winter camp. Nicolas suffers from delusional, detached psychological disorder, always dreaming these surreal, altered states in which he is in danger. There seems to be hints of him being sexually abused by his father who is also mentally unstable. He wets the bed due to these nightmares.Because it isn't to clear to me, we can assumed that Nicolas has been seriously traumatized in life. He thinks that there is a conspiracy by a group of people who go around sequestering young boys for body parts. He thinks that his father is working undercover to exposed these people. He makes friends with another boy at the camp, Hodkann. They develop a strong friendship and Nicolas tell him about this weird conspiracy. There is one episode in which one of this triggered nightmares causes Nicolas to wondered outside in the cold and the snow, he almost freezes to death. He becomes very sick. At the same time, a boy disappears in the general area, the police is searching everywhere. Ski trips are disrupted from the camp, staff becomes upset. There is  a description of a vehicle near where the boy disappears, and fits Nicolas's father. The father gets caught by the police on a tip by Hodkann. At the end Nicolas leaves the camp and goes home while watching on a newsreel in the TV about his father being apprehended by the law.This is a very strange movie.

It takes a while to get used to the mixture of dream, flashback and daydream which give the film its unsettling but highly vivid quality. The overall effect is quite compelling, regardless of plot details. The psychology of the main character is projected with great control through the extraordinary, almost visionary sequences, and the young actor's restraint works very well, surely, rather in the way Louis Malle achieved in 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' - his expressions give a sense of a great deal being held back, which is very true to his age and character type. It also forms a contrast with the often violent or bloody events depicted. He is both damaged by his upbringing and looking for tenderness to make everything better, both in the form of a mother figure and a pubescent gay feeling towards the much more extravert Hodkann. The dream he has in the middle of the film is surely a wet dream which he doesn't understand but feels in some vague way is something to feel guilty about, as with everything else. This opens onto the most extraordinary scene in the night in the snow, where he goes out - all shot in blue tones in the mountain silence - magical! The relationship between the two boys seems to revisit a theme Claude Miller explored in the 70s in 'La meilleure facon de marcher' - another brilliant look at sexual feelings of a gay sort at a holiday camp, but there it was between the young men organising it whereas here the characters are much younger. As others have said, the music is also brilliant, right from the opening shot of an ordinary motorway where we suddenly hear a trumpet rasp like the sound of a braying elephant. And the Rossini is so atmospheric and startling ... all in all, it is hard to decide whether the film is more sinister or sad, but a strange beauty is there in spite of the awfulness and the plight of Nicolas remains haunting long after the film has ended.",5,Compelling cinema ...,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,2152,"['confusion', 'film', 'have', 'brought', 'about', 'reviewers', 'here', 'less', 'so', 'second', 'viewing', 'found', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'followed', 'easily', 'enough', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'was', 'looking', 'right', 'way', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'mixture', 'dream', 'flashback', 'daydream', 'give', 'film', 'unsettling', 'highly', 'vivid', 'quality', 'overall', 'effect', 'quite', 'compelling', 'regardless', 'plot', 'details', 'psychology', 'main', 'character', 'projected', 'great', 'control', 'extraordinary', 'almost', 'visionary', 'sequences', 'young', 'actor', 'restraint', 'very', 'well', 'surely', 'rather', 'way', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'achieved', ""'Au"", 'Revoir', 'Les', 'Enfants', 'expressions', 'give', 'sense', 'great', 'deal', 'being', 'held', 'back', 'very', 'true', 'age', 'character', 'type', 'also', 'contrast', 'often', 'violent', 'bloody', 'events', 'depicted', 'damaged', 'upbringing', 'looking', 'tenderness', 'make', 'everything', 'better', 'form', 'mother', 'figure', 'pubescent', 'gay', 'feeling', 'much', 'more', 'extravert', 'Hodkann', 'dream', 'middle', 'film', 'surely', 'wet', 'dream', ""n't"", 'understand', 'feels', 'vague', 'way', 'something', 'feel', 'guilty', 'about', 'everything', 'else', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'scene', 'night', 'snow', 'where', 'out', 'shot', 'blue', 'tones', 'mountain', 'silence', 'magical', 'relationship', 'two', 'boys', 'revisit', 'theme', 'Claude', 'Miller', 'explored', '70s', ""'La"", 'meilleure', 'facon', 'marcher', 'brilliant', 'look', 'sexual', 'feelings', 'gay', 'sort', 'holiday', 'camp', 'was', 'young', 'men', 'organising', 'here', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'younger', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'music', 'also', 'brilliant', 'right', 'opening', 'shot', 'ordinary', 'motorway', 'where', 'suddenly', 'hear', 'trumpet', 'rasp', 'sound', 'braying', 'elephant', 'Rossini', 'so', 'atmospheric', 'startling', 'hard', 'decide', 'film', 'more', 'sinister', 'sad', 'strange', 'beauty', 'there', 'spite', 'awfulness', 'plight', 'Nicolas', 'haunting', 'long', 'film', 'ended']",N/A
