Other reviewers have covered it thoroughly, but I did want to point out that episode one of season seven is a shortened version of the movie 24: Redemption. Watch the movie; it's great. But if you miss it, episode one will catch you up.",4,"Great series, some flaws but who cares",1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,378,"['love', 'exciting', 'well-acted', 'page-turner', 'series', 'flaws', 'seem', 'irrelevant', 'such', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'production', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'covered', 'thoroughly', 'did', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'episode', 'one', 'season', 'seven', 'shortened', 'version', 'movie', '24', 'Redemption', 'Watch', 'movie', 'great', 'miss', 'one', 'will', 'catch', 'up']",24: Complete Seasons 1-7

1253925,A2LF07KCXDR70D,B0027CSMWM,ILoveTheUSA,"[8, 9]","24 is by far the best thing to come out of a television in the last 30 yrs and before that I wouldn't remember.  The character of Jack Bauer never lets you down and you can always expect him to do something, or anything. I bought this set for 150.00 and it is a great value for the amount of entertainment on it.  The only drawback with this particular set is the discs do not have the breakdown of episodes on the disc face, it only tells you what season and the number of that disc. This is a minor thing to complain about and it doesn't take away from the show of course. It will be a sad day when this show ends.",5,24-Greatest Show in the History of Television,1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,616,"['24', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'come', 'television', 'last', '30', 'yrs', 'would', ""n't"", 'remember', 'character', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'never', 'down', 'can', 'always', 'expect', 'do', 'something', 'anything', 'bought', 'set', '150.00', 'great', 'value', 'amount', 'entertainment', 'only', 'drawback', 'particular', 'set', 'discs', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'breakdown', 'episodes', 'disc', 'face', 'only', 'what', 'season', 'number', 'disc', 'minor', 'thing', 'complain', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'show', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'sad', 'day', 'when', 'show']",24: Complete Seasons 1-7

This series started before we got a DVR and we did not have a TIVO.The picture quality is unreal for DVD. Looks like Blu-Ray! The production quality is like a movie, not at all like any other TV series I have watched.My son started watching the series at his house before we started and reported back that he was up until the wee hours of the morning watching it because it was down-right addictive. When my wife and I started watching, we were good for 4 shows at a sitting. Like I said, we don't like to schedule time for a TV series. We MAKE time for this series, into the wee hours of the morning.Great characters, actors, picture quality and plot. No hiccups on playback.

Couple it with real world possibilities with the situations we are truly facing; Addicting!  The liberals have a hard time with it because Jack bypasses so-called civil liberties.  As bad as that may seem, it is sometimes necessary.  I don't like government getting into my life any more than anyone else, but this show opened up dialogue into what is or isn't necessary to win a war on terror.  How far will someone go or what may someone do to protect an American?  After 23 years in the US Army, I would say many of us would do what it takes, regardless...........Jack took everything to the extreme to protect his country and countrymen.  From the very first episode, I was hooked.  Yeah, there is the lame Hollywood crap that detracts from some episodes, but for the most part, it is heart-pumping, adrenaline racing, non-stop action.  I have seen every episode, but after all this time, I wanted to go back to the beginning.  So, I bought every episode.
