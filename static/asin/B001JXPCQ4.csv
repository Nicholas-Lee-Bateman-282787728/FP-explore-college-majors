Several friends got together for a dance party, and two of us gave it a test drive last night. First, you need to know that the pace is fast. If you get crabby when you are unable to follow choreography, you may want to think twice. The second time through I was still flailing all over the place. If you are concerned about looking good/smooth, take that into consideration. The songs, Mickey, New Attitude, Hit Me With Your Best Shot, etc. are not the original artists. The participants are all sizes and act happy to be there. Richard. Well, Richard has a sequin-encrusted heart. He is the all-time cheerleader.The Dance party we had included several ages and fitness levels. Two of the younger girls are avid athletes and they had a blast and broke a sweat. Some of the older girls appreciated the low-impact aspects. All decided they'd like to add this to their fitness routine and would like to try more of Simmon's videos.

1207291,A13700AF4X40YG,B001JXPCQ4,Loves Books in MD,"[1, 1]","When I returned to regular exercising about 6 years ago, I started out with Richard Simmons because I knew he specialized in exercises that were safe and effective for people of all size and age.  What I didn't realize is just how much fun he makes it.As I got a bit more advanced in my level of fitness, I started to ""cheat"" on Richard, but he's never entirely left my rotation of a HUGE collection of exercise DVD's.  His ""Blast and Tone"" and ""Tone and Sweat"" are great routines for sculpting.  Among my routines is Kathy Smith, The Firm, Erin O'Brien, Leslie Sansone and others.What I have found is that you just simply can't beat Richard for a good cardio workout that won't be so strenuous that you'll ask your family to stand by to administer CPR. I haven't used this video in quite some time and had forgotten how much fun it is and how fast the time goes by.  Many of the moves are those used in some of his previous DVD's.  This is not a criticism, as the routines to each song are altogether new and fresh.  I tend to put off using a new video or one I haven't used in a while because there is always a learning curve.  So if you've done any of his other routines, you may find this one easier to master, as I did.  These routines can be geared to your level of fitness.  If you have limitations, you can tone down your gestures, and as you advance - or if you're more advanced, you can throw yourself into the movements with a little more abandon.  I can say that I've never hurt myself doing a Richard Simmons routine.  Like all the others, you get a warm up and cool down stretch.As I've said in other reviews, if you really pay attention to what you're doing in the dances, you'll discover that you're doing a low impact version of many standard or classic exercises - but he makes it so much fun that you don't notice.  I ended sweaty but energized and in good spirits and I don't think it gets much better than that.  The man is pure magic - he makes exercise time disappear in a flash!!  If 45 minutes is a bit too long for you, I recommend all of the routines in the Blast Off series, which are 30 minutes in length.",5,"Fun, Energetic and Safe Workout - Classic Richard",1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,2134,"['When', 'returned', 'regular', 'exercising', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'started', 'out', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'knew', 'specialized', 'exercises', 'were', 'safe', 'effective', 'people', 'size', 'age', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'it.As', 'got', 'bit', 'more', 'advanced', 'level', 'fitness', 'started', 'cheat', 'Richard', 'never', 'entirely', 'left', 'rotation', 'HUGE', 'collection', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'Blast', 'Tone', 'Tone', 'Sweat', 'are', 'great', 'routines', 'sculpting', 'routines', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'Firm', 'Erin', ""O'Brien"", 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'others.What', 'have', 'found', 'just', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Richard', 'good', 'cardio', 'workout', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'strenuous', ""'ll"", 'ask', 'family', 'stand', 'administer', 'CPR', 'have', ""n't"", 'used', 'video', 'quite', 'time', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'how', 'fast', 'time', 'Many', 'moves', 'are', 'used', 'previous', 'DVD', 'not', 'criticism', 'routines', 'song', 'are', 'altogether', 'new', 'fresh', 'tend', 'put', 'off', 'using', 'new', 'video', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'used', 'while', 'always', 'learning', 'curve', 'So', ""'ve"", 'done', 'other', 'routines', 'may', 'find', 'one', 'easier', 'master', 'did', 'routines', 'can', 'be', 'geared', 'level', 'fitness', 'have', 'limitations', 'can', 'tone', 'down', 'gestures', 'advance', ""'re"", 'more', 'advanced', 'can', 'throw', 'movements', 'little', 'more', 'abandon', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'hurt', 'doing', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'routine', 'others', 'get', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'stretch.As', ""'ve"", 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'dances', ""'ll"", 'discover', ""'re"", 'doing', 'low', 'impact', 'version', 'many', 'standard', 'classic', 'exercises', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'ended', 'sweaty', 'energized', 'good', 'spirits', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'better', 'man', 'pure', 'magic', 'exercise', 'time', 'disappear', 'flash', '45', 'minutes', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'recommend', 'routines', 'Blast', 'Off', 'series', 'are', '30', 'minutes', 'length']",Supersweatin': Party Off the Pounds

The workout routine itself is full of big dance moves and really gets you to sweat!

As Richard has done these kinds of workouts for the last three decades or so, he's still good at what he loves to do.  Help people loose weight.  Since I use it, to Richard Simmons, himself: Thank you very much, for creating this great workout DVD, and I enjoy doing them workouts.One thing is great is he does ask after two or three songs if we feel thirsty, and reminds us to drink plenty of water before, during, and after the workout.  He's right.  Some can dehydrate badly if they don't drink water when using his workout programs, along with any other workout videos.  Especially Aerobics.  So I pause my DVD after two or three songs and drink my water, then push play and ready to continue the workout.",5,Party Off The Pounds,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,886,"['are', 'one', 'who', '80s', 'songs', 'loves', 'working', 'out', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'DVD', 'Supersweatin', 'Party', 'Pounds', 'right', 'workout', 'video', 'Richard', 'done', 'kinds', 'workouts', 'last', 'three', 'decades', 'so', 'still', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'Help', 'people', 'loose', 'weight', 'use', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'Thank', 'very', 'much', 'creating', 'great', 'workout', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'workouts.One', 'thing', 'great', 'ask', 'two', 'three', 'songs', 'feel', 'thirsty', 'drink', 'plenty', 'water', 'workout', 'right', 'can', 'dehydrate', 'badly', 'do', ""n't"", 'drink', 'water', 'when', 'using', 'workout', 'programs', 'other', 'workout', 'videos', 'Especially', 'Aerobics', 'So', 'pause', 'DVD', 'two', 'three', 'songs', 'drink', 'water', 'then', 'push', 'play', 'ready', 'continue', 'workout']",Supersweatin': Party Off the Pounds

The music is fun and I like the scenery changes and the length of time it takes  is short yet long enough to do before I go to work and still get a great workout. The only thing I cannot stand is the blond in the pink shorts who acts all cheesy staring at the camera like she is auditioning for a better gig somewhere. It is almost enough to make you gag. I think the people need to be happy and entertaining but no one smiles this much while working out it looks like her face might break she smiles so much. It seems like she absolutely tries to steal the show and it drives you crazy!!!When she is on the sidelines she looks like she wants to jump in and take over. It is really hard to focus on Richard because your attention is pulled to her. Buy the video it is fun but you too will become obsessed with the girl in the pink shorts!!!!! LOL  I like all the extras that are thrown in, the dancing waiters and glamor girls it is fun!!!!",5,Party Off The Pounds,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,1034,"['be', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'exercise', 'Video', 'have', 'music', 'fun', 'like', 'scenery', 'changes', 'length', 'time', 'short', 'yet', 'long', 'enough', 'do', 'go', 'work', 'still', 'get', 'great', 'workout', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'blond', 'pink', 'shorts', 'who', 'cheesy', 'staring', 'camera', 'auditioning', 'better', 'gig', 'somewhere', 'almost', 'enough', 'make', 'gag', 'think', 'people', 'need', 'be', 'happy', 'entertaining', 'one', 'much', 'working', 'out', 'face', 'might', 'break', 'so', 'much', 'absolutely', 'steal', 'show', 'crazy', 'When', 'sidelines', 'jump', 'take', 'over', 'really', 'hard', 'focus', 'Richard', 'attention', 'pulled', 'Buy', 'video', 'fun', 'too', 'will', 'become', 'obsessed', 'girl', 'pink', 'LOL', 'like', 'extras', 'are', 'thrown', 'dancing', 'waiters', 'glamor', 'girls', 'fun']",Supersweatin': Party Off the Pounds
