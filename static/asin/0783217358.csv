46775,A16CZRQL23NOIW,0783217358,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[1, 3]","The Fifties and Sixties were possibly the most irreverent decades of the American cinema.The acidic questioning about a group of brave soldiers in a mission in the Artic Pole (104 to be exact) during a whole year, is a serious problem in which the abstinence may result extremely dangerous for the proposed goal.So, when Tony Curtis gets a furlough to Paris, accompanied by a beautiful but short-mind girl Sandra Roca, the Army will have the best they can in order to avoid the encounter can be out of control due the amorous skills of this singular personage.The rest of the plot runs for you. There admirable landscapes and clever sequences hovered by whimsical and double sense occurences.An evasive film that reachs its goal.",4,To be just a friend of a beautiful girl is like having a Rembrandt and hanging it to reverse!,1223337600,"10 7, 2008",2008,729,"['Fifties', 'Sixties', 'were', 'possibly', 'most', 'irreverent', 'decades', 'American', 'cinema.The', 'acidic', 'questioning', 'group', 'brave', 'soldiers', 'mission', 'Artic', 'Pole', '104', 'be', 'exact', 'whole', 'year', 'serious', 'problem', 'abstinence', 'may', 'result', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'proposed', 'goal.So', 'when', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'furlough', 'Paris', 'accompanied', 'beautiful', 'short-mind', 'girl', 'Sandra', 'Roca', 'Army', 'will', 'have', 'best', 'can', 'order', 'avoid', 'encounter', 'can', 'be', 'control', 'due', 'amorous', 'skills', 'singular', 'personage.The', 'rest', 'plot', 'admirable', 'landscapes', 'clever', 'sequences', 'hovered', 'whimsical', 'double', 'sense', 'occurences.An', 'evasive', 'film', 'goal']",N/A
