I read the synopsis and reviews and wasn't really impressed but the price that I bought it for was unbeatable so I had to. The story is touching and I really fell into the stories and emotions that each character presents. Then ending wasn't what I expected and I will have to admit that a tear or two appeared. I recommend this to anyone. There is some nudity so if anyone is looking to buy this for children beware of that.,5,All around great!,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,482,"['was', 'lot', 'better', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'read', 'synopsis', 'reviews', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'impressed', 'price', 'bought', 'was', 'unbeatable', 'so', 'had', 'story', 'touching', 'really', 'fell', 'stories', 'emotions', 'character', 'presents', 'Then', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'will', 'have', 'admit', 'tear', 'two', 'appeared', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'nudity', 'so', 'anyone', 'looking', 'buy', 'children', 'beware']",Rumbling Hearts
1084863,A4R9MJFF8UFND,B000S1KUMY,Brian Camp,"[0, 0]","""Rumbling Hearts"" is a heart-wrenching romantic melodrama told in 14 half-hour episodes. If you like your romances laden with pain, anguish, and uncertainty about how everything is going to be resolved, this one's for you. If you prefer your love stories sugar-coated, with pat endings, and filled with false notions about human nature, then you should stick to your American dramas. I found this one quite compelling throughout.This Japanese animated TV series was based on a videogame and tells the story of a love triangle involving Narumi Takayuki, his girlfriend Haruka Suzumiya, and Haruka's best friend, Mitsuki Hayase, all in their senior year of high school. In the first two episodes, it becomes clear that Mitsuki, who managed the difficult task of bringing Narumi and the awfully shy Haruka together, has designs on Narumi herself and begins intruding on their relationship to the point where she causes Narumi to arrive late to meet Haruka one evening only for Narumi to find that Haruka was seriously injured after being hit by a vehicle while waiting on the sidewalk and has been taken to a hospital. This is at the end of the second episode. Episode 3 takes place three years later and we gradually learn that Haruka's been in a coma all that time and Narumi and Mitsuki have become lovers, despite horrible feelings of guilt. At the end of ep. 3, Haruka wakes up for the first time and the female doctor leads her to believe it's still three years ago and urges Haruka's friends and family to play along until Haruka has recovered enough to withstand the shock.When Narumi visits Haruka in the hospital, he cuddles with her gently on the bed and maintains the illusion that he's still her boyfriend. Mitsuki gets anxious about this and insists that he tell Haruka the truth about them. She even moves in with Narumi at some point during all of this. Both had taken jobs after high school instead of going to college, so we see them at their workplaces as well. Haruka's younger sister, Akane, has her ups and downs with Narumi, whom she once worshipped as ""Big Brother"" but feels betrayed now because he's with Mitsuki, although she softens toward him as he visits Haruka and keeps her spirits up. Akane wears her middle school uniform to the hospital to fool Haruka into thinking it's still three years ago (despite the fact that Akane looks three years older and the uniform's a little tight on her, a plot hole that the series never gets around).I had little patience for Narumi's constant wavering and even yelled at the screen a few times, but in the end I think he makes the right decision, as much as it goes against the moral path I felt he should have taken. It was hard to feel sympathy for Mitsuki at first, since she so clearly betrayed her best friend, but she does suffer a lot--probably the worst of any of the characters--so she ultimately earns our sympathy. The final episode was deeply touching and offered a satisfying resolution. The basic situation here reminded me of an older anime series about a high school love triangle, ""Kimagure Orange Road,"" particularly its movie spin-offs.Important supporting characters include Narumi's best friend, Shinji, who commits an act of betrayal himself; Dr. Kozuki, Haruka's doctor, whose dress is short and hair is unkempt and has a bent, unlit cigarette dangling from her lips at all times; and Mrs. Ishida, Mitsuki's boss at the trading firm where she works. There are two annoying nurses, one of whom looks and sounds like a child and one of whom is a hot redhead in a way-too-short pink uniform clearly designed as fan-service for male viewers, something that's evidently a holdover from the videogame. There are also two annoying little waitresses, Ayu and Mayu, at the family restaurant where Narumi works. They're supposed to provide comic relief, but I found them grating.If you can get past those irritants, the series offers a visual style grounded in classical Japanese filmmaking. I love the way scenes are composed and edited and the way they're lit. It's quite a beautiful series to watch. Typical is a shot of Narumi sitting alone, in despair, in a dark and empty hospital waiting area, as well as various uses of public spaces in and around Yokohama, where the series takes place. The hospital faces a beach and there are many shots of golden sunsets seen from the window of Haruka's room. A picture book called ""Mayauru's Gift,"" about a forest elf who befriends a human girl, plays a prominent role in the story, particularly in the final episode. I like the understated music score, with lots of piano solos, and the lovely opening and end songs performed by Haruka's voice actress, Minami Kuribayashi. (Just for the record, I watched this with the Japanese soundtrack on, not the English dub.)The show's source material is apparently a ""hentai"" dating simulation videogame, something I'm not familiar with, although the term ""hentai"" would imply lots of sex in the game. This is not the case in the TV series. There are a couple of tender lovemaking scenes between Narumi and Mitsuki and a few brief nude shots of Mitsuki, but nothing more graphic than that.",4,Animated melodrama about love's difficulties is

After watching the first episode or two, I knew I'd like the series, but as with any good anime, I was in no mood to rush through it.  With that being said, today I blew through two and ahalf discs worth of episodes. I couldn't help myself.The depth of emotion in this series is really something.  I was drawn into the world these characters lived in.  The depression, the anxiety, etc.  I was so connected and invested, that I had to see it through to the end.  An ending that would hopefully make things ok.  An ending that would relieve the tension and sadness.  Something to redeem the tragic theme of the series....That ending never came.  We received, what I perceive to be, a very shallow closing that makes absolutely no psychological sense whatsoever.  Takayuki and Mitsuki....Really?  After spending the entire series together as nothing more than empty shells of human beings that acted as nothing more than a crutch for each other, I am to believe they were truly in love with each other the entire time?  In spite of all the neglect, pain, and anger they inflicted upon each other?If this is the case, then what was the point of this anime?  Haruka's accident?  What was that exactly for?  Why was her character included?  Taka and Mits were together for 3 years after the events early in the series.  What the hell kind of payoff did we get?  Those two still together, and Haruka's existance ultimatey meaningless.  Takayuki supposedly loved Haruka so much that he is completely lost.  Distraught.  Doesn't see a point in living.  Enter the self centered opportunist Mitsuki.  Hooray, she commits to a failure of a 3 year relationship with Takayuki that looks more like loathing than love, but I'm to believe that mess can be redeemed into a believable love?  A happy ending?  NO. We see Takayuki's pain.  His anguish.  His regret.  We see the hope and light return to him when Haruka begins to improve.  He shows signs of his feelings for her returning to the forefront.  The kiss...the fact that he was ready to be intimate with her right in her hospital bed...THEN... he sees her scars...and is repulsed...  Lost interest.  From that moment on, it started the downhill slide for me.  That ending destroys any crediblity Takayuki and Mitsuki have.  Those two scumbags deserve a life of mysery together.What angers me so much is how much I loved the series til the last two episodes, in which I knew what was coming.  An ending that made no sense based on the 20 plus episodes that preceeded it.  An ending without redemption.  An ending that left me angry, disgusted, and repulsed.",3,Disgusted and Repulsed. *SPOILERS*,1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,2666,"['Not', 'many', 'anime', 'there', 'find', 'unable', 'stop', 'watching', 'watching', 'first', 'episode', 'two', 'knew', ""'d"", 'like', 'series', 'good', 'anime', 'was', 'mood', 'rush', 'being', 'said', 'today', 'blew', 'two', 'ahalf', 'discs', 'worth', 'episodes', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'myself.The', 'depth', 'emotion', 'series', 'really', 'something', 'was', 'drawn', 'world', 'characters', 'lived', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'etc', 'was', 'so', 'connected', 'invested', 'had', 'see', 'end', 'ending', 'would', 'hopefully', 'make', 'things', 'ending', 'would', 'relieve', 'tension', 'sadness', 'Something', 'redeem', 'tragic', 'theme', 'series', 'ending', 'never', 'came', 'received', 'what', 'perceive', 'be', 'very', 'shallow', 'closing', 'absolutely', 'psychological', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'Takayuki', 'Mitsuki', '.Really', 'spending', 'entire', 'series', 'together', 'nothing', 'more', 'empty', 'shells', 'human', 'beings', 'acted', 'nothing', 'more', 'crutch', 'other', 'am', 'believe', 'were', 'truly', 'love', 'other', 'entire', 'time', 'spite', 'neglect', 'pain', 'anger', 'inflicted', 'other', 'case', 'then', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'anime', 'Haruka', 'accident', 'What', 'was', 'exactly', 'Why', 'was', 'character', 'included', 'Taka', 'Mits', 'were', 'together', '3', 'years', 'events', 'early', 'series', 'What', 'hell', 'kind', 'payoff', 'did', 'get', 'two', 'still', 'together', 'Haruka', 'existance', 'ultimatey', 'meaningless', 'Takayuki', 'supposedly', 'loved', 'Haruka', 'so', 'much', 'completely', 'lost', 'Distraught', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'living', 'Enter', 'self', 'centered', 'opportunist', 'Mitsuki', 'Hooray', 'failure', '3', 'year', 'relationship', 'Takayuki', 'more', 'loathing', 'love', ""'m"", 'believe', 'mess', 'can', 'be', 'redeemed', 'believable', 'love', 'happy', 'ending', 'NO', 'see', 'Takayuki', 'pain', 'anguish', 'regret', 'see', 'hope', 'light', 'return', 'when', 'Haruka', 'improve', 'signs', 'feelings', 'returning', 'forefront', 'kiss', 'fact', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'intimate', 'right', 'hospital', 'bed', 'THEN', 'scars', 'repulsed', 'Lost', 'interest', 'moment', 'started', 'downhill', 'slide', 'ending', 'crediblity', 'Takayuki', 'Mitsuki', 'have', 'two', 'scumbags', 'deserve', 'life', 'mysery', 'angers', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'series', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'ending', 'made', 'sense', 'based', '20', 'episodes', 'preceeded', 'ending', 'redemption', 'ending', 'left', 'angry', 'disgusted', 'repulsed']",Rumbling Hearts

1084867,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B000S1KUMY,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","Kimi ga Nozomu Eien (The Eternity You Desire) is a Japanese visual novel (interactive novel/game similar to choose your own adventure stories) released on PC, then later ported to Dreamcast and PS2.  In 2003 the game was made into a 14 episode anime TV series.  There is also a 4 episode OVA with an alternate ending to the TV run.At first glance, this is a strong series.  The American title is unfortunate because it really is the worst sounding name for an anime series, it sounds more like a Romance novel.  You know; the ones with the half naked guy on the cover and the woman draped over him.  But the series doesn't quite get into the 'romance' genre.  Instead this series is about relationship struggles, guilt, and the actions of the characters after a certain event.  This review points out a lot of shortcomings, but I'm being nitpicky.  It's actually a very good series, but one I felt could have been improved upon.  But for those who enjoy some melodrama, it's worth watching.This next section will contain a few early spoilers, so read at your own risk (though even the Amazon editorial review AND the back cover of the series mention everything I will mention here).  The story centers around 5 main characters: Haruka and Akane Suzumiya, Takayuki, Mitsuki and Shinji (though involved in some major events, he is a secondary character).  Takayuki and Haruka date in high school, though you get the sense that Mitsuki likes him.  Takayuki is on his way to meet with Haruka one day, but is distracted when he sees Mitsuki.  They go shopping briefly, but he realizes that he is very late to his meeting with Haruka.  He finally gets to their rendezvous only to discover that Haruka was involved in a serious accident.  Takayuki is overcome with guilt, since his tardiness indirectly contributed to the accident (she was in the wrong place at the wrong time - if he had met her on time, then she wouldn't have stayed in that spot and been hit by a vehicle).  So Haruka winds up in a coma.  This is really where the series starts.  Episode three opens with the title song and credits and the series takes place three years later. Three years have passed and everyone is living their lives.  Takayuki is involved with Mitsuki and he hasn't been to see Haruka in the hospital.  Finally he hears that Haruka has woken up, and this is where things get messy.A few things are rather far fetched.  The doctors want to keep the truth from Haruka so Takayuki and everyone must pretend that no time has passed.  So Haruka is obviously fraught with mental issues, but it doesn't really come off right.  It seems cruel at times that everyone is forced to lie to her, and even when she starts figuring out that more time has passed than everyone lets on, they go to even bigger steps to hide the truth (fearing a relapse).  It seems that this was created just to give some conflict to the relationship between Mitsuki and Takayuki.  Already the guilt has nearly consumed them, but now the writers add even more strife into their life.  It makes the viewer almost think that Haruka waking up was one of the worst case scenarios.  It really doesn't endear viewers to Haruka's character.The struggles between Takayuki and Mitsuki are pretty melodramatic.  They argue about the most inane issues when merely talking to each other would solve everything.  And of course, many relationships do have these issues, but this show takes things to extremes.  Especially since the two aren't long time spouses that have grown tired of each other or anything like that.  The two seem fond of each other, but each takes turns being very depressed while the other confesses his/her love.  Then the depressed one becomes positive and the previously happy person becomes angry and depressed.  It's this constant see-saw which gets a little frustrating and the main reason I docked a star.And don't hate on this review because of that.  If one compares this series with Clannad (a solid five star young romance story) then the results are obvious.  Though this series has a bit more 'adult' feel with the characters struggling with their jobs and real life, Clannad seemed to just have a better story and much more likable cast of characters.  Though we do feel sorry for Takayuki and feel his guilt, we don't really cheer anyone in this series on.  It is like watching a depressing puppet show at times.The other real let down is the side stories.  The restaurant girls are more annoying than endearing, though they have their moments at times.  I felt that the writers could have done a bit more with their characters.  Also, the nurses and doctor are walking anime stereotypes.  Another area that the series could have improved on.  Really the most interesting character to me was Akane, Haruka's younger sister.  I really felt the writers and creators had a soft spot for this girl.  She's really the only honest and stoic of the main characters.  Sadly, she got much less screen time than the others.What the series does well though is bring a more adult story to the screen.  There are a few 'boob shots', so beware of animated breasts.  I think that was the main reason we see a TV-14 rating.  There is little profanity, usually from the mouth of the blonde waitress girl ('son of a ____' and 'go step in cat crap').  But I was watching in Japanese with English subtitles, so the English dub might be different.The translation of the subtitles are very spot on.  I hugely applaud Funimation for accurate translations.Animation is of good quality, even if it is nearly 10 years old.  Some of the characters really have an 'anime stereotype' look, even Mitsuki with her blue hair and cat ear part.  There is a little background music, and it is mostly sweet sounding piano pieces.Overall I think this was a good series.  I did buy it, and it was about $15 so it wasn't a big disappointment.  If I had paid $25 or $30 I would have been peeved.  I would recommend it for at least one viewing through.  As far as a purchase?  I'm actually reselling my copy if that tells you anything.  I'm glad I saw it, but I don't really foresee watching it again.  But it's generally very good.Original run: 2003-2004Rated TV-14.14 episodes on 3 discs.330 minute run time.1.33:1 aspect ratio.English audio or Japanese audio, English subtitles available.$14.95

I saw this at Sakura Con 2008 and it made me cry and made me go and pick up the anime).Anyways, this is one of the saddest ""harem"" animes out there. It's not like School Days where things got from bad to worse because of stupidity and its a ""harem"" because its a visual novel game where the main guy could choose any girl he wants but the anime doesn't treat it like a harem and it focuses on a drama love triangle instead of the harem visual novel and its better this way because two of the five love interests are not only ""loli"" girls but they serve as the comic relief of this really depressing series.The series starts out as a cute slice of life. Takayuki Narumi (the main guy) is best friends with Shinji Taira and Mitsuki Hayase. Takayuki originally had a crush on Mitsuki but he kept it a secret. Mitsuki liked him to but seeing her friend Haruka Suzumiya madly in love with Takayuki, she sets them up on a date. At first, its awkward given Takayuki doesn't understand Haruka and Haruka is too shy to voice her feelings but after a talk, the two start to fall for each other.Tragedy strikes though. Takayuki is known for being late to his dates (unintentionally) but because he was late this time, Haruka is involved in an accident sending her into a coma. Takayuki blames himself for not picking her up on time and falls into despair and almost goes insane if Mitsuki didn't intervene and comfort him. This results in a misunderstanding from Haruka's little sister Akane and she shuns the two for betraying her unconscious sister.3 years later, Takayuki has recovered and works at a restaurant while Mitsuki lost most of her life giving up on swimming and working as an office lady. The two are together now and happy, but that happiness comes crashing down when Haruka wakes up not realizing that she's been in a coma for 3 years. The drama continues.But yes, this series is very depressing. I know people hate Mitsuki for going back on her friend but she was in a lose lose situation with watching Takayuki go insane or go back on Haruka knowing that if she were to wake up, she might not forgive her.So make sure to grab the tissue box when you watch this anime.

I am a very harsh critic and it is hard for much to appeal to me, but this anime series was touching.It starts out like most anime dramas that are about high school students. A cute girl (Haruka Suzumiya) likes a cute boy (Takayuki Narumi) they get together and fall in love, but then the story does a 180. Takayuki is late for a date(like usual) and Haruka gets hit be a vehicle while standing on the sidewalk. She does'nt die, but she goes into a comma for about three years. Mean while her best friend (Mitsuki Hayase) cares for Takayuki because he blames himself for Haruka condition. Mitsuki falls in love with Takayuki while taking care of him then they start to date and Takayuki starts to return to his normal self. All of a sudden Takayuki gets a call one day and is told that Haruka woke back up and does'nt know she was in a comma for three years.You will experience much pain, sadness and anger with the characters in this series. It is easy to relate to all of them throughout the whole story. If you like anime and stories that consist of much drama then you will enjoy this series.

One of Mitsuki's girl friends, Haruka Suzumiya, has a crush on Narumi, so Mitsuki hooks the two together. They become close friends, and they even have sex together. However, the love story is put on hold after a fatal car crash.The second half of the story takes place three years later. Within this time period, Narumi has a romance with Mitsuki, who is now part of an insurance company. However, everything seems to change when Haruka returns miraculously.Overall, the storyline is passable. However, ""Rumbling Hearts"" suffers from overplaying the drama. Mitsuki is a jerk, who really doesn't care much for her former friend who almost died in a car accident. In fact, Mitsuki spends half of the series worrying that Narumi will not love her anymore. She's so obsessed that she tries her best to keep Narumi's attention off of Haruka.This story boils down to the voice actors and the story, which is already extremely overrated on the Anime News Network and [...] Web sites. Eventually, this anime revolves completely around Narumi's love relationships will all three girls in the story: even Haruka's sister. With so many girlfriends around, one will definitely why Narumi would want to focus on the selfish Mitsuki, who obsesses all the time about whether Narumi loves her.Narumi claims that he doesn't want anyone to get hurt, but what he's really saying is that he wants to make sure Mitsuki doesn't kill herself looking for someone else to love her. The screenwriter is so self-centered in restraining Mitsuki to an overdependent relationship with Narumi. Honestly, women in Japan will never want to be this constrained to the servitude of other men.In fact, the only likable character in this series is Haruka. Yet, even she keeps longing for a sexual relationship with Narumi after she awakens from her coma. Haruka is supposed to be the strong, independent girl who struggles courageously to recover, but even she is restricted to relying on Narumi for emotional support. Narumi is not trustable either: he lies about his own relationship status, supposedly to make sure Haruka doesn't get too shocked.There's very little to appreciate about ""Rumbling Hearts,"" a 14-episode series based on an disgusting, erotic dating game. There should be no reason for it to gain so much popularity in America. However, the male audience of anime fans undoubtedly love this infantile orgy of adolescent sex and romantic overdependence.

The story revolves around a guy named Takayuki, his original love interest Haruka, and her friend Mitsuki. Their tight bond of friendship and love however fall apart one day when a terrible accident occurs leaving Haruka in a Coma. Then the story begans, and so it the good parts of it end. To better understand the anime I should break down the characters. Takayuki, is more or less the cowardly boy who is afraid to admit how he feels, is indecisive, and he is easily manipulated. To put it point blank, he has no spine when it comes to his life and the decisions he makes. Then we have Haruka, who is the nice shy girl who steals your heart. She is cute, kind, and you root for her all the way. She is really something else the kind of girl that's rare and hard to find. Last but not least we have Mitsuki. She is supposed to be the best friend of Haruka, but she is selfish, self centered, and can't seem to keep her clothes on. Matter of fact my main problem with this story is the relation ship of Takiyuki and Mitsuki. Through out the story even when they are little, it seems Mitsuki selfishly wants to be in a relationship with Takiyuki. She drags him away from Haruka when Takiyuki is in need of him. In other words she is closing in on her best friends man. Unfortanately an incident allows her best friend to be taken out the picture. While her best friend is in a Coma she seduces Takiyuki at his lowest moment and takes advantage of him, because she wants him to herself. Not to mention that she doesn't feel very much guilt about it, and for the most part could care less about her friend Haruka who is in a coma. She calls her the ""sad little girl"" and even tries to keep ""Takiyuki"" from seeing her, when he needs to be with Haruka for reasons beyond love. The plot focuses on Mitsuki's selfish needs and desires, and Takiyuki plays right in to her trap. Not to mention Mitsuki is quite a harlott. She isn't oh so faithful to Takiyuki, but she even turns that situation around to make herself seem like the victim. Meanwhile Haruka is the one left in the dark while her boyfriend and best friend have a love affair. Most of the time you feel depressed and pitty for Haruka because she is so innocent, and when she comes out her Coma she has to awaken to all these new issues that she doesn't deserve. The story really is on the far end of what a love story should be. The Male lead character is a wimp and no romantic, and his main love interest ""Haruka"" is the one he neglects the most. IF there is any real love or actual relationship between Takiyuki and Mitsuki they never show it. For the most part your left with the impression that Mitsuki takes advantage of Takiyuki, when he is obviously hurting. She manipulates him and almost forces a relationship out of a bad situation. Takiyki on the other hand is so brainless that he can't see past her obsession and self centered motives. He only repeats what it was like for him when he was younger. He ignore Haruka his girlfriend to help Mitsuki with her needs. On an end not I found the series unentertaining, I didn't enjoy the story at all, and it did not feel fulfilling at the end. It was sad, depressing, and really a tragic story. Haruka is really just too good for them both.",1,"I'd rate it lower, but this is as low as I can go.",1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,3712,"['Trust', 'like', 'good', 'love', 'story', 'Anime', 'see', 'awsome', 'is..', 'is..', 'absolute', 'torture', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'romance', 'anime', 'Rumbling', 'Hearts', 'felt', 'more', 'was', 'watching', 'tradgedy', 'really', 'quite', 'depressing', 'plot', 'Rumbling', 'Hearts', 'basicly', 'Highschool', 'friends', 'grow', 'adults', 'how', 'innocent', 'years', 'are', 'are', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'problems', 'deal', 'story', 'around', 'guy', 'named', 'Takayuki', 'original', 'love', 'interest', 'Haruka', 'friend', 'Mitsuki', 'tight', 'bond', 'friendship', 'love', 'however', 'fall', 'apart', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'terrible', 'accident', 'leaving', 'Haruka', 'Coma', 'Then', 'story', 'begans', 'so', 'good', 'parts', 'end', 'better', 'understand', 'anime', 'should', 'break', 'down', 'characters', 'Takayuki', 'more', 'less', 'cowardly', 'boy', 'who', 'afraid', 'admit', 'how', 'indecisive', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'put', 'point', 'blank', 'spine', 'when', 'life', 'decisions', 'Then', 'have', 'Haruka', 'who', 'nice', 'shy', 'girl', 'who', 'heart', 'cute', 'kind', 'root', 'way', 'really', 'something', 'else', 'kind', 'girl', 'rare', 'hard', 'find', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'have', 'Mitsuki', 'supposed', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'Haruka', 'selfish', 'centered', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'clothes', 'Matter', 'fact', 'main', 'problem', 'story', 'relation', 'ship', 'Takiyuki', 'Mitsuki', 'story', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'little', 'Mitsuki', 'selfishly', 'be', 'relationship', 'Takiyuki', 'drags', 'away', 'Haruka', 'when', 'Takiyuki', 'need', 'other', 'words', 'closing', 'best', 'friends', 'man', 'Unfortanately', 'incident', 'best', 'friend', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'picture', 'best', 'friend', 'Coma', 'Takiyuki', 'lowest', 'moment', 'advantage', 'herself', 'Not', 'mention', ""n't"", 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'guilt', 'most', 'part', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'friend', 'Haruka', 'who', 'coma', 'sad', 'little', 'girl', 'even', 'tries', 'keep', 'Takiyuki', 'seeing', 'when', 'be', 'Haruka', 'reasons', 'love', 'plot', 'Mitsuki', 'selfish', 'needs', 'desires', 'Takiyuki', 'plays', 'right', 'trap', 'Not', 'mention', 'Mitsuki', 'quite', 'harlott', ""n't"", 'oh', 'so', 'faithful', 'Takiyuki', 'even', 'situation', 'make', 'seem', 'victim', 'Meanwhile', 'Haruka', 'one', 'left', 'dark', 'boyfriend', 'best', 'friend', 'have', 'love', 'affair', 'Most', 'time', 'feel', 'depressed', 'pitty', 'Haruka', 'so', 'innocent', 'when', 'out', 'Coma', 'awaken', 'new', 'issues', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'story', 'really', 'far', 'end', 'what', 'love', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'Male', 'lead', 'character', 'wimp', 'romantic', 'main', 'love', 'interest', 'Haruka', 'one', 'most', 'IF', 'real', 'love', 'actual', 'relationship', 'Takiyuki', 'Mitsuki', 'never', 'show', 'most', 'part', 'left', 'impression', 'Mitsuki', 'advantage', 'Takiyuki', 'when', 'obviously', 'hurting', 'almost', 'forces', 'relationship', 'bad', 'situation', 'Takiyki', 'other', 'hand', 'so', 'brainless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'obsession', 'self', 'centered', 'motives', 'only', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'ignore', 'Haruka', 'girlfriend', 'help', 'Mitsuki', 'needs', 'end', 'not', 'found', 'series', 'unentertaining', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'fulfilling', 'end', 'was', 'sad', 'depressing', 'really', 'tragic', 'story', 'Haruka', 'really', 'just', 'too', 'good']",Rumbling Hearts

Luckily, they had the S.A.V.E. edition so i snatched it up quickly and as soon as they dvds arrived, I watched it again. Often the series hits very raw nerves and even makes you think to yourself how you would feel in the same situation. The show dives into the human heart and puts people in the most insane situations and watches how they handle them. Keep in mind, this is NOT an anime for children. This is very much an adult feature as it deals with very adult situations and relationships. It makes you ask yourself &#34;How would you feel if someone you loved was taken from you?&#34; It then pushes that question and follows it up with &#34;Now how would you feel if that lost love came back to life years later?&#34; There will be times where you will cry. It is that type of Anime, but you will end up loving it exactly for that reason. If you ever thought of trying anime with a real life feel to it, this is where you want to go.

1084886,A10U58PHFDK81C,B000S1KUMY,The Anime  Adict,"[13, 15]","Okay rumbling Hearts is a series that starts off like any typical shojo anime. In other words cute girl pinning for a guy, confessing her feelings. You know the bit. However unlike most Shojo this one takes a truly tragic turn when the cute girl, Haruka, gets into a traffic accident while waiting for her boyfriend and is servely wounded ending up in a coma. The next episode takes place three years later and shows how her boyfriend and her best friend have done their best to move on. Just as the two finally start to be able to move on, Haruka wakes up and throws a huge monkey wrench into things. Not only does she wake up but she has no idea that she's been in a coma for three years but instead thinks its only been a few days. What is a decent guy to do when his love for a girl he lost to tragedy some back when he already has a girl he cares for? That is the question the main male leads left with, but that's only one of the main plots. There's the guilt striken Best friend, the typical but devoted teenager younger sister, and of course Haruka all trying to find their happiness in a no win situation.Now for the actual review. First off maybe most noteable is the art work. It is simply amazing. It's fluid, crisp, smooth and well just look at the box cover and you get the idea of just how good it is. The second most noteable is the music which is wonderful and heart felt, from its happy fiddles to the more lonesome guilt struck piano and voilen pieces. Now then is the story line. Why does this take such a low bar? Well because the story doesn't really start until the forth episode. However once it does it draws you in completely. As it is a shojo the story is character based, which for a change is a good thing. Though at first all the characters start off as typical stereo types they quickly change and develope according to their new found situation. What I really loved about the story was that despite most shows, anime or not, tend to focus on the supposed main victum (the person in the coma) this one takes the time to show how such an event makes everyone involved is a victum. It goes that extra mile to show who everyone suffers tremendously. While there are a few truly funny jokes the series has a solemn to even depressing atmosphere to it. The voice acting is extremely well done, though there are times when the main male lead sounds almost drunk but only for a line or two. As excellent as everything is the story is really the gem of the series, which for a shojo is rare.Now I usually go one about all the stuff with the series and in the case of most Shojo that tends to be a lot. However, I amd more then happy to say this series really doesn't have any errors or flaws in it, at all.In the end I would have to say buy this series, it's more then worth the money even if it's only 3 dvds long.

1084890,A3PT0B4K2ALQF5,B000S1KUMY,"TYC ""Anime Fan""","[4, 5]","Rumbling Hearts is one of my favorite anime series of all time. It is truly a dramatic and moving anime series. The story centers around four high school friends and a tragic acccident that changes all their lives forever. These four friends are forced to make tough decisions that not only affect their lives but each others as well. The ending and some of the subject matter (such as the complicated relationships between the four friends) won't be to everyone's liking, but real life isn't always predictible or fair. This series is many things at once- a comedy, a drama, and a romantic series.

That is not to say that it's pornographic, but there is nudity. They show just enough to give the understanding of the sexual situations, but not enough to make me say porn. The interpersonal relationships are complex, and you may have yourself having to explain a lot of concepts if you're watching it with a young person. There... I've said my piece.With that being said, I enjoyed this story. Most times in an anime series, I can sit through three or four episodes at a time, without stopping. This time, I couldn't. I had to watch each episode one at a time. I guess it's because there's a lot of emotional turmoil to deal with. The story seemed to capture the idea that life is not neat and tidy. There are times when you can't help hurting someone even when you don't want to. Sometimes you do have to give up the thing you think you want most, and sometimes good things come from the train wrecks of our lives.I found I enjoyed the English voice cast, with the exception of Haruka. I think I can tell why they chose to make her voice sound so mousy, but I think sometimes they have a tendency to make all the women in an anime below the age of thirty sound like they're 12 years old. But now that I think about it, I think they did it to emphasis that Haruka is truly a part of Takayuki's childhood past in school, and at the same time found a voice for Mitsuki that actually sounded like a young adult woman who is very much a part of his present. The story boils down to a choice --do I try to recapture the past, or do I hold onto what I have and look towards the future?All in all, I was very happy with the ending. The only problem I had with the ending was that I would have rather they brought the four friends together in some way that allows them to bury the past together and move on. It seemed like the last five minutes of the show were devoted entirely to Haruka's book and Akane. Mitsuki gets very little attention at all in that entire ending sequence. Other than that, I did enjoy this one, but I won't be showing it to anyone else. It's kind of one of those ones you need to watch by yourself with a box of kleenex and the curtain's drawn just in case you tear up a time or two.",5,"Not in the norm, but I enjoyed it.",1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,2324,"['Parents', 'not', 'repeat', 'NOT', 'good', 'anime', 'younger', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'child', '14', '15', 'not', 'say', 'pornographic', 'nudity', 'show', 'just', 'enough', 'give', 'understanding', 'sexual', 'situations', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'say', 'porn', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'are', 'complex', 'may', 'have', 'having', 'explain', 'lot', 'concepts', ""'re"", 'watching', 'young', 'person', ""'ve"", 'said', 'piece.With', 'being', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'Most', 'times', 'anime', 'series', 'can', 'sit', 'three', 'four', 'episodes', 'time', 'stopping', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'had', 'watch', 'episode', 'one', 'time', 'guess', 'lot', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'deal', 'story', 'seemed', 'capture', 'idea', 'life', 'not', 'neat', 'tidy', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'hurting', 'someone', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Sometimes', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'thing', 'think', 'want', 'most', 'sometimes', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'train', 'wrecks', 'lives.I', 'found', 'enjoyed', 'English', 'voice', 'cast', 'exception', 'Haruka', 'think', 'can', 'tell', 'why', 'chose', 'make', 'voice', 'sound', 'so', 'mousy', 'think', 'sometimes', 'have', 'tendency', 'make', 'women', 'anime', 'age', 'thirty', 'sound', ""'re"", '12', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'think', 'think', 'did', 'emphasis', 'Haruka', 'truly', 'part', 'Takayuki', 'childhood', 'past', 'school', 'same', 'time', 'found', 'voice', 'Mitsuki', 'actually', 'sounded', 'young', 'adult', 'woman', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'present', 'story', 'down', 'choice', 'do', 'try', 'recapture', 'past', 'do', 'hold', 'what', 'have', 'look', 'future', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'ending', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'ending', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'brought', 'four', 'friends', 'together', 'way', 'bury', 'past', 'together', 'move', 'seemed', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'show', 'were', 'devoted', 'entirely', 'Haruka', 'book', 'Akane', 'Mitsuki', 'very', 'little', 'attention', 'entire', 'ending', 'sequence', 'Other', 'did', 'enjoy', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'showing', 'anyone', 'else', 'kind', 'one', 'ones', 'need', 'watch', 'box', 'kleenex', 'curtain', 'drawn', 'just', 'case', 'tear', 'up', 'time', 'two']",Rumbling Hearts
