569120,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B000056EW8,D. Mok,"[5, 8]","This film is in need of an actress like Maruschka Detmers (who starred in the 1986 Italian version).  While the Italian version was far from a great film, Detmers gave the uninhibited, feral sexual-predator performance needed to drive the concept.  In Devil in the Flesh 2, what we get is the American homogenized version:  A bad campus soap opera desperately trying to be an erotic thriller.  And when you marry the worst elements of Felicity with Poison Ivy, expect the worst.And you get the worst.  She may be good-looking, but Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is unable to project real threat and sensuality:  Her over-the-top makeup job doesn't help and in fact makes her look like a mockery, a parody of a dangerous woman.  And you can literally see her actors' contract pass through your eyes when you hit the sex scenes (&quot;No nudity...no nudity...&quot;), where director Marcus Spiegel whips out all the worst cliches:  Airy music, dissolves, body doubles with their heads cut off, and...oh!  Those painful stop-motion slow-mo shots!  If a soft-core stripper video is what they wanted, they certainly succeeded.  This character is supposed to be the sexy, uninhibited, dangerous woman who shakes up everybody's world, and the obvious fakeness of the sex scenes just destroys her credibility.  At least try to hide the body double, folks!The directing and editing are just miserable, with the death-by-phone-wire scene being especially laughable.  Shoot it three times from similar angles and use all of them -- great way to make the audience notice the stunt woman!  I know this film was made for cable, but did they have to flaunt the low production values and bad taste at every turn?A flick deserving of the utmost contempt and ridicule.",1,Horrifyingly bad.,1060732800,"08 13, 2003",2003,1736,"['film', 'need', 'actress', 'Maruschka', 'Detmers', 'who', 'starred', '1986', 'Italian', 'version', 'Italian', 'version', 'was', 'far', 'great', 'film', 'Detmers', 'gave', 'uninhibited', 'feral', 'sexual-predator', 'performance', 'needed', 'drive', 'concept', 'Devil', 'Flesh', '2', 'what', 'get', 'American', 'homogenized', 'version', 'bad', 'campus', 'soap', 'opera', 'desperately', 'trying', 'be', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'when', 'marry', 'worst', 'elements', 'Felicity', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'expect', 'worst.And', 'get', 'worst', 'may', 'be', 'good-looking', 'Jodi', 'Lyn', ""O'Keefe"", 'unable', 'project', 'real', 'threat', 'sensuality', 'over-the-top', 'makeup', 'job', ""n't"", 'help', 'fact', 'look', 'mockery', 'parody', 'dangerous', 'woman', 'can', 'literally', 'see', 'actors', 'contract', 'pass', 'eyes', 'when', 'hit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'quot', 'nudity', 'nudity', 'quot', 'where', 'director', 'Marcus', 'Spiegel', 'out', 'worst', 'cliches', 'Airy', 'music', 'dissolves', 'body', 'doubles', 'heads', 'cut', 'off', 'oh', 'painful', 'stop-motion', 'slow-mo', 'shots', 'soft-core', 'stripper', 'video', 'what', 'wanted', 'certainly', 'succeeded', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'sexy', 'uninhibited', 'dangerous', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'everybody', 'world', 'obvious', 'fakeness', 'sex', 'just', 'destroys', 'credibility', 'least', 'try', 'hide', 'body', 'double', 'folks', 'directing', 'editing', 'are', 'just', 'miserable', 'death-by-phone-wire', 'scene', 'being', 'especially', 'laughable', 'Shoot', 'three', 'times', 'similar', 'angles', 'use', 'great', 'way', 'make', 'audience', 'notice', 'stunt', 'woman', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'cable', 'did', 'have', 'flaunt', 'low', 'production', 'values', 'bad', 'taste', 'turn', 'flick', 'deserving', 'utmost', 'contempt', 'ridicule']",Devil in the Flesh 2
569121,AEYWW350RPE81,B000056EW8,Jeremy,"[1, 1]","OK if you saw the first movie there really isn't any new plot twists, it's pretty much a rehash of part 1. The only real difference here is that the main character from the original, Debbie Strong (played by the amazing Rose McGowan) is now played by Jodi Lynn O'Keefe. In this movie Debbie escapes from a mental hospital and under a false identity attends college and develops another obsessive crush on a professor. When things don't go Debbie's way, the body count starts to pile up. Like I said earlier this movie is almost identical to the first one. But the real surprise here is Jodi. Although Rose McGowan is missed, Jodi pulls off an amazing performance and is so fun to watch that you will forgive the producers for making this movie without Rose. I've seen Jodi in teen films like She's All That and Whatever it Takes but in this film she really shows off her acting ability and she has more screen time than in her other films like Halloween: H20 and The Crow:Salvation. So to sum it up if your a fan of Jodi Lynn you should check it out. If you want an original thriller you might be disappointed.",4,Jodi Lynn O' Keefe Shines !!,992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,1110,"['OK', 'saw', 'first', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'new', 'plot', 'twists', 'pretty', 'much', 'rehash', 'part', '1', 'only', 'real', 'difference', 'here', 'main', 'character', 'original', 'Debbie', 'Strong', 'played', 'amazing', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'now', 'played', 'Jodi', 'Lynn', ""O'Keefe"", 'movie', 'Debbie', 'mental', 'hospital', 'false', 'identity', 'college', 'obsessive', 'crush', 'professor', 'When', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'Debbie', 'way', 'body', 'count', 'pile', 'up', 'said', 'earlier', 'movie', 'almost', 'identical', 'first', 'one', 'real', 'surprise', 'here', 'Jodi', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'missed', 'Jodi', 'amazing', 'performance', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'will', 'forgive', 'producers', 'making', 'movie', 'Rose', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jodi', 'teen', 'films', 'film', 'really', 'acting', 'ability', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'other', 'films', 'Halloween', 'H20', 'Crow', 'Salvation', 'So', 'sum', 'up', 'fan', 'Jodi', 'Lynn', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'want', 'original', 'thriller', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed']",Devil in the Flesh 2

I haven't seen a performance this pitiful since Renee Zwelieger starred in the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  She is just no Rose McGowan.  The girl's anger and hurt is reminiscent of the anger and hurt shown by an actress in a Midol commercial.  As a matter of fact, that is probably the only thing she is capable of doing--advertising for Midol or Preparation H.

569123,A11ID14NBRS9UB,B000056EW8,"""marshmelly""","[5, 6]","I didn't even know there was a sequel to Devil In The Flesh (which I own on DVD) until I was at the video store recently in the thriller section and spotted it. I looked at it and rented it just because if I have seen and liked an original if there is a sequel I have to see it. But there has been several sequel disasters (ex: the prequel to the hilarious movie dumb and dumber called dumb and dumberer, the most stupid movie I have ever seen and an insult and embarrassment to the first I love all kinds of movies) and plus I tend to be skeptical when a movie is from a company I haven't heard of and the sequel is a different main character than the first cause it makes it less believeable.But I was familar with Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and thought it didn't look that bad so I rented it anyways. I was pleasantly suprised I thought I may think it was okay but I didn't expect to like it a lot more than the original.Although I like Rose Mcgowen who played the same part in the first movie and thought she did with it, I actually liked Jodi Lyn O'Keefe's portrayal of it better. I find her more attractive than Rose and more believeable bitc*y than her as well. She also has a much better taste in clothes than Rose does but all of this doesn't make for a good actress. Which I was delighted to find she actually is a good actress although she doesn't really get the chance to prove it since Jodi always gets stuck with the beautiful but bitc*y roles (ex: She's All That, Whatever It Takes) but in this one she's not really bitc*y just decieving.Jodi plays Debbie Strong who escapes from the mental instution she was sent when she murdered her mother grandmother and attempted to murder her obbsessive crush on her english teacher in the original. She also murdered several others in the original including her best friend and a boy from school who had the hots for her. She escapes and steals the car, money and idenity of a girl she met by in a way hitchhiking. The girl was really rich and realuclantly off to college but was very dopey. Deb doesn't even have to murder her before she can she accedently murders herself.Her original plan was to take her intuition money and go to mexico and be crazy but while getting the money she runs into An english Professor at the college Mr. Deckard (who is so much cuter than the guy she was obbsessed with in the first movie and he takes it much farther than the other guy did) and immeditely becomes smitten so she decides to go to the college instead of mexico.She meets and effects several people besides Mr. Deckard including her geeky inexperienced roomate Laney, a total jock jerk who even though Deb constantly embarrasses him in front of his friends and mouths off to him he won't take no for an answer (just like the jerky jock that wouldn't take no for an answer in the first one. Also note that they look alike except in my opinion this one is uglier and more stupid than the other guy) and lots of other people.As the movie progresses Debbie gets more obbsessed more insane and more dangerous. When Debbies roomy and new best friend leaks on to her disturbing past she's a goner. When the RA of the floor takes her mouthing off to far guess what she's a goner. When a drunk won't leave her alone guess what he's a goner. The number of bodies count up through the movie. When she really gets insane is when she fills Sam up with too much wine and the two end up getting hot and heavy in his office. When he suddenly feels guilty about his actions he of course breaks it off and that is when her character becomes dangerously obbsessed. Again like the original, the teacher has a blonde girlfriend who has had problems with the relationship. When his girlfriend becomes pregnat and she spys on the two also getting hot and heavy in his office that is when she goes after the girlfriend just like the character did in the original.All in all this movie has funny moments, creepy moments, dramatic moments, etc. etc. I didn't find it scary and I don't see why it was in the thriller section it could be labeled more of a drama than a thriller at least to me (but also note it takes a great deal to scare me) but it is an amusing movie and worth taking a look at. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe steals the movie and I wish she was given more main parts in movies.",4,worth giving a try,1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,4298,"['did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'sequel', 'Devil', 'Flesh', 'own', 'DVD', 'was', 'video', 'store', 'recently', 'thriller', 'section', 'spotted', 'looked', 'rented', 'just', 'have', 'seen', 'liked', 'original', 'sequel', 'have', 'see', 'been', 'several', 'sequel', 'disasters', 'ex', 'prequel', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'dumb', 'dumber', 'called', 'dumb', 'dumberer', 'most', 'stupid', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'insult', 'embarrassment', 'first', 'love', 'kinds', 'movies', 'tend', 'be', 'skeptical', 'when', 'movie', 'company', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'sequel', 'different', 'main', 'character', 'first', 'cause', 'less', 'believeable.But', 'was', 'familar', 'Jodi', 'Lyn', ""O'Keefe"", 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad', 'so', 'rented', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'suprised', 'thought', 'may', 'think', 'was', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'lot', 'more', 'original.Although', 'like', 'Rose', 'Mcgowen', 'who', 'played', 'same', 'part', 'first', 'movie', 'thought', 'did', 'actually', 'liked', 'Jodi', 'Lyn', ""O'Keefe"", 'portrayal', 'better', 'find', 'more', 'attractive', 'Rose', 'more', 'believeable', 'bitc*y', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'much', 'better', 'taste', 'clothes', 'Rose', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'actress', 'Which', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'actually', 'good', 'actress', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'chance', 'prove', 'Jodi', 'always', 'stuck', 'beautiful', 'bitc*y', 'roles', 'ex', 'Takes', 'one', 'not', 'really', 'bitc*y', 'just', 'decieving.Jodi', 'Debbie', 'Strong', 'who', 'escapes', 'mental', 'instution', 'was', 'sent', 'when', 'murdered', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'attempted', 'murder', 'obbsessive', 'crush', 'english', 'teacher', 'original', 'also', 'murdered', 'several', 'others', 'original', 'including', 'best', 'friend', 'boy', 'school', 'who', 'had', 'hots', 'car', 'money', 'idenity', 'girl', 'met', 'way', 'hitchhiking', 'girl', 'was', 'really', 'rich', 'realuclantly', 'college', 'was', 'very', 'dopey', 'Deb', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'murder', 'can', 'accedently', 'herself.Her', 'original', 'plan', 'was', 'take', 'intuition', 'money', 'go', 'mexico', 'be', 'crazy', 'getting', 'money', 'english', 'Professor', 'college', 'Mr.', 'Deckard', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'cuter', 'guy', 'was', 'obbsessed', 'first', 'movie', 'much', 'farther', 'other', 'guy', 'did', 'immeditely', 'becomes', 'smitten', 'so', 'go', 'college', 'instead', 'mexico.She', 'meets', 'effects', 'several', 'people', 'Mr.', 'Deckard', 'including', 'geeky', 'inexperienced', 'roomate', 'Laney', 'total', 'jock', 'jerk', 'who', 'even', 'Deb', 'constantly', 'front', 'friends', 'mouths', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'answer', 'just', 'jerky', 'jock', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'answer', 'first', 'one', 'Also', 'note', 'look', 'alike', 'opinion', 'one', 'uglier', 'more', 'stupid', 'other', 'guy', 'lots', 'other', 'movie', 'Debbie', 'more', 'obbsessed', 'more', 'insane', 'more', 'dangerous', 'When', 'Debbies', 'roomy', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'leaks', 'disturbing', 'goner', 'When', 'RA', 'floor', 'mouthing', 'off', 'far', 'guess', 'what', 'goner', 'When', 'drunk', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alone', 'guess', 'what', 'goner', 'number', 'bodies', 'count', 'up', 'movie', 'When', 'really', 'insane', 'when', 'Sam', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'wine', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'hot', 'heavy', 'office', 'When', 'suddenly', 'guilty', 'actions', 'course', 'breaks', 'off', 'when', 'character', 'dangerously', 'obbsessed', 'Again', 'original', 'teacher', 'blonde', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'had', 'problems', 'relationship', 'When', 'girlfriend', 'pregnat', 'spys', 'two', 'also', 'getting', 'hot', 'heavy', 'office', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'character', 'did', 'original.All', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'creepy', 'moments', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'etc', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'was', 'thriller', 'section', 'could', 'be', 'labeled', 'more', 'drama', 'thriller', 'least', 'also', 'note', 'great', 'deal', 'scare', 'amusing', 'movie', 'worth', 'taking', 'look', 'Jodi', 'Lyn', ""O'Keefe"", 'movie', 'wish', 'was', 'given', 'more', 'main', 'parts', 'movies']",Devil in the Flesh 2
