370004,A108A421PC6MH3,6303340997,Bob Stout,"[15, 15]","This is film by, for, and about film geeks. Naturally, I love it. Using mostly stop motion photography, it details the trials of Mike Jitlov trying to get his film made. It's riddled with inside jokes about the industry, many obvious but some subtle. It's also quite textured with lots of cute and clever sight gags going on in the periphery - much like a Joe Dante film. A worthy showcase for Jitlov's work, I only gave it four stars instead of five for its lack of any substantial plot, feeling more like a &quot;The Making Of This Movie&quot; documentary. However, the four stars definitely do not detract from its overall entertainment value, which is substantial.As other have pointed out, most people (including yours truly) missed this when it was first released - easy to do since it only played about a week. And that's a shame - it's extremely witty and entertaining. Even more so when you consider the work involved in shooting a live action film in stop motion.I'm fortunate enough to own one of the reportedly 1600 laser discs which were made and it's a perennial favorite of mine. However, even on VHS, if you get a chance to buy it, I can heartily recommend it.",4,Possibly the best vanity film ever made,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,1176,"['film', 'film', 'geeks', 'Naturally', 'love', 'Using', 'mostly', 'stop', 'motion', 'photography', 'details', 'trials', 'Mike', 'Jitlov', 'trying', 'get', 'film', 'made', 'riddled', 'inside', 'jokes', 'industry', 'many', 'obvious', 'subtle', 'also', 'quite', 'textured', 'lots', 'cute', 'clever', 'sight', 'gags', 'going', 'periphery', 'much', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'film', 'worthy', 'showcase', 'Jitlov', 'work', 'only', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'lack', 'substantial', 'plot', 'feeling', 'more', 'quot', 'Making', 'Movie', 'quot', 'documentary', 'However', 'four', 'stars', 'definitely', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'overall', 'entertainment', 'value', 'substantial.As', 'other', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'most', 'people', 'including', 'yours', 'truly', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'easy', 'do', 'only', 'played', 'week', 'shame', 'extremely', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'consider', 'work', 'involved', 'shooting', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'stop', 'motion.I', ""'m"", 'fortunate', 'enough', 'own', 'one', 'reportedly', '1600', 'laser', 'discs', 'were', 'made', 'perennial', 'favorite', 'mine', 'However', 'even', 'VHS', 'get', 'chance', 'buy', 'can', 'heartily', 'recommend']",The Wizard of Speed and Time VHS
370005,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,6303340997,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[0, 0]",Many years back a buddy of mine told me about this movie since he knew I loved SciFi or just plain fun movies. I caught it on TV and immediately went out and bought the VHS. Am I glad I did. It wasn't a mainstream movie and so mostly film students and a few from the SciFi community that trade movies or discuss them at conventions knew about this little gem. It has become a bit of a cult classic. Even though this movie was made on a shoestring budget and by an independent many times this type of movie ends up on DVD because of the following. I am quite surprised this one hasn't reached that status yet. Unfortunately this hasn't been shown on TV in several years to my knowledge or I am sure it would be on DVD by now. We can only hope someone is smart enough to back getting this on DVD since I am sure once it is word will get around and they will more than recoup their investment. If you are lucky enough to catch this on TV or find it on VHS somewhere be sure to watch it. I think you will agree it is amazing what someone can do once they put their mind to it. A film student is told he can't do things. When he puts together his magic of changing things it is truly a mystery of time and speed that you will find fascinating and funny. A very entertaining movie that the whole family can enjoy. Get used copy if you can. $12-15 isn't bad considering how much you will watch it. I saw a few people being fair priced and they have a good track record. More than $18 for a used copy is just getting greedy.,5,"Long, Long, Ago",1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,1516,"['Many', 'years', 'back', 'buddy', 'mine', 'told', 'movie', 'knew', 'loved', 'SciFi', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'movies', 'caught', 'TV', 'immediately', 'went', 'bought', 'VHS', 'Am', 'glad', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'mainstream', 'movie', 'so', 'mostly', 'film', 'students', 'few', 'SciFi', 'community', 'trade', 'movies', 'discuss', 'conventions', 'knew', 'little', 'gem', 'become', 'bit', 'cult', 'classic', 'Even', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'independent', 'many', 'times', 'type', 'movie', 'up', 'DVD', 'following', 'am', 'quite', 'surprised', 'one', ""n't"", 'reached', 'status', 'yet', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'been', 'shown', 'TV', 'several', 'years', 'knowledge', 'am', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'DVD', 'now', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'someone', 'smart', 'enough', 'back', 'getting', 'DVD', 'am', 'sure', 'word', 'will', 'get', 'will', 'more', 'recoup', 'investment', 'are', 'lucky', 'enough', 'catch', 'TV', 'find', 'VHS', 'somewhere', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'think', 'will', 'agree', 'amazing', 'what', 'someone', 'can', 'do', 'once', 'put', 'mind', 'A', 'film', 'student', 'told', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'things', 'When', 'together', 'magic', 'changing', 'things', 'truly', 'mystery', 'time', 'speed', 'will', 'find', 'fascinating', 'funny', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Get', 'used', 'copy', 'can', '12-15', ""n't"", 'bad', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'will', 'watch', 'saw', 'few', 'people', 'being', 'fair', 'priced', 'have', 'good', 'track', 'record', 'More', '18', 'used', 'copy', 'just', 'getting', 'greedy']",The Wizard of Speed and Time VHS

Some years later I had the  opportunity to meet Mike Jittlov and his mother, and they're just great  people.  The film itself is terrific!  This is definitely a cult classic,  with Web sites and a newsgroup dedicated to it; it would have been a  box-office hit, and a best-selling video, if Hollywood politics hadn't  caused it to be pulled from theatres bare days after its release.  Now it's  hard to find in any medium except unauthorised low-quality videotape  copies, although 1600 laser discs were pressed and sometimes show up at  auctions.  If you can find this film, get it and watch it.  Twice. And then  step through it to see all the hidden sight-gags and messages.

Part of the legend has to do with all the Hollywood machinations that Jittlov set out to lampoon and that ended up biting him in the end.Watching the film today is a bit of a disappointment for anyone raised on the special effects of the post-Star Wars era. The effects aren't anywhere as impressive as when Jittlov made this film. Jittlov's acting and that of much of his mixed amateur-professional cast is indeed amateurish, as is much of his directing.

(Which, incidentally, aside from the Barnstable twins, was the best part of the program -- oh, no -- i tell a lie -- Frank and Caroline Mouris [Frank Film] did a beauty of a cut-out animation sequence.)It was going to be titled ""The Wizard of Speed and Time"", and it was going to be the story of a man who gained the ability to use 100% of his brain instead of the roughly 10% we allegedly use in our normal lives.He would be superintelligent, nd superfast and generally superish, and the normal human authorities would feel threatened, and...It sounded great.  But it didn't happen -- instead we get this sad travesty.Yes, it's funny.  Yes, it recycles parts of some of Jittlov's previous work -- but, none of the shorts used are complete, and none have the proper original music cues.Yes, he gets some revenge on a Large Hollywood Production Company which shall remain nameless but they did a teevee special (mostly pretty unspecial) about special effects that Jittlov worked on.Yes, he lays some zingers on the Hollywood guild-and-union system.Yes, there are some wonderful gags layered in here and there -- try freeze-framing the ""Japanese Jumping Wall"" segment as the Wizard scoots along the wall, and be sure to read all signs and placards and so on in the background.But ""the system"" managed to grind down even such a wild talent as Jittlov's, and, not only it ain't what ""might have been,"" but i understand Mike got such a screwing from the producers/releaseing company that, according to one report, he left film-making entirely...Another good man done gone...",3,Of all the words of mice and men...,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,2371,"['saddest', 'are', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Having', 'encountered', 'tall', 'fellow', 'green', 'jacket', '2AM', 'so', 'World', 'SF', 'Convention', 'Boston', 'ummm', '1980', 'greeted', ""'re"", 'Mike', 'Jittlov', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'stood', 'talked', 'time', 'Things.I', 'got', 'crick', 'neck', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'film', 'six', 'foot', 'tall', 'had', 'look', 'up', 'talking', 'told', 'plans.First', 'i', 'asked', 'how', '*', '%', '*^', 'made', 'stop-motion', 'animated', 'frisbees', 'Mouse', 'Mania', 'spin', 'cruised', 'when', 'i', 'point', 'out', 'effect', 'people', 'who', 'know/have', 'done', 'stop-motion', 'jaws', 'drop', 'told', 'me.And', 'then', 'told', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'had', 'planned', 'spinning', 'off', 'segment', 'Disney', 'promo', 'show', 'Black', 'Hole', 'Which', 'incidentally', 'aside', 'Barnstable', 'twins', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'program', 'oh', 'i', 'tell', 'lie', 'Frank', 'Caroline', 'Mouris', '[', 'Frank', 'Film', ']', 'did', 'beauty', 'cut-out', 'animation', 'sequence', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'titled', 'Wizard', 'Speed', 'Time', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'gained', 'ability', 'use', '100', '%', 'brain', 'instead', 'roughly', '10', '%', 'allegedly', 'use', 'normal', 'lives.He', 'would', 'be', 'superintelligent', 'nd', 'superfast', 'generally', 'superish', 'normal', 'human', 'authorities', 'would', 'feel', 'threatened', 'sounded', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'instead', 'get', 'sad', 'travesty.Yes', 'funny', 'Yes', 'parts', 'Jittlov', 'previous', 'work', 'none', 'shorts', 'used', 'are', 'complete', 'none', 'have', 'proper', 'original', 'music', 'cues.Yes', 'revenge', 'Large', 'Hollywood', 'Production', 'Company', 'shall', 'remain', 'nameless', 'did', 'teevee', 'special', 'mostly', 'pretty', 'unspecial', 'special', 'effects', 'Jittlov', 'worked', 'on.Yes', 'zingers', 'Hollywood', 'guild-and-union', 'system.Yes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'gags', 'layered', 'here', 'there', 'try', 'freeze-framing', 'Japanese', 'Jumping', 'Wall', 'segment', 'Wizard', 'scoots', 'wall', 'be', 'sure', 'read', 'signs', 'placards', 'so', 'background.But', 'system', 'managed', 'grind', 'down', 'even', 'wild', 'talent', 'Jittlov', 'not', 'only', 'ai', ""n't"", 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'i', 'understand', 'Mike', 'got', 'screwing', 'producers/releaseing', 'company', 'according', 'one', 'report', 'left', 'film-making', 'entirely', 'good', 'man', 'done', 'gone']",The Wizard of Speed and Time VHS
