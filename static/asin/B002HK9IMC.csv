1268623,A2GWFIHB1RGX,B002HK9IMC,Buzz Smith,"[1, 2]","First off let me say I like Nick. I think he is very creative. His role as Terry on Reno 911, his small movie appearances-Blades of Glory, Bench Warmers are hysterical. This is not his best work. The material is very thin with drawn out stories of no point. His first cd is a bit better, and the skit at the end with David Spade is worth the price alone. But, this act doesn't have much of anything. A few chuckles. The audience is obviously been added too, as they roar when it's not appropriate. I know many comics add crowd cheers like sitcoms do, but it's very obvious here, and detracts from what little originality is offered. Too bad, I wanted to like this, it's just not up to par with his other work.

As the title implies, this isn't high-brow, intellectual humor for hoity-toity rich people to smirk over as they're sipping champagne and eating caviar.  Nick is a dude's dude, so you're going to hear a lot of dude jokes about getting drunk, getting stoned, and - of course - getting manually stimulated by non-English-speaking Chinese septuagenarian females.  Nick's not as dirty as a lot of other comedians, but this is definitely a show for mature audiences only (primarily for language much more so than content).  Just because your twelve-year-old kid will get all of the jokes and probably laugh harder than you will doesn't mean you'll want him to watch it.  I can't say this ever had me rolling around on the floor in tears, but it's consistently funny from start to finish.",4,Monkey high fives,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,925,"['Nick', 'Swardson', 'funny', 'dude', 'comedic', 'talents', 'are', 'full', 'display', 'almost', 'hour-long', 'performance', 'filmed', 'live', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'title', 'implies', ""n't"", 'high-brow', 'intellectual', 'humor', 'hoity-toity', 'rich', 'people', 'smirk', 'over', ""'re"", 'sipping', 'champagne', 'eating', 'caviar', 'Nick', 'dude', 'dude', ""'re"", 'going', 'hear', 'lot', 'dude', 'jokes', 'getting', 'drunk', 'getting', 'stoned', 'course', 'getting', 'manually', 'stimulated', 'non-English-speaking', 'Chinese', 'septuagenarian', 'females', 'Nick', 'not', 'as', 'dirty', 'lot', 'other', 'comedians', 'definitely', 'show', 'mature', 'audiences', 'only', 'primarily', 'language', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'content', 'Just', 'twelve-year-old', 'kid', 'will', 'get', 'jokes', 'probably', 'harder', 'will', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'ever', 'had', 'rolling', 'around', 'floor', 'tears', 'consistently', 'funny', 'start', 'finish']",N/A
1268625,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002HK9IMC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 10]","Nick Swardson, the popular young comedian known for his roles as Terry Bernadino on ""Reno 911!"", his film ""Grandma's Boy"" (which he co-wrote) and appearances in films such as ""Art School Confidential"", ""The Benchwarmers"", ""Blades of Glory"", ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" and more.With the release of his Comedy Central DVD ""Seriously, Who Farted?"", Swardson takes on the following topics of enjoying things much more when he's drunk such as fast food, to topics of playing XBOX 360 with his buddies and cussing and people around the complex thinking he is shooting gay porn and weed.  For the most part, a lot of the comedy is about having a good time and having fun with his friends, getting drunk and comedy that definitely targets the college and young adult crowd.  The Austin, Texas crowd was very receptive and supportive and definitely Swardson fed off that that energy that night.The following is the chapter listing for ""Seriously, Who Farted?""""* Intro* Booze is Magic* Gay?* Weed is Dope* Pot Brownies* Old Lady Hand Job* Ninja Job* UFC* Blades of Glory* Monkeys* Being Old People Part 2VIDEO & AUDIO:Video is featured in widescreen.  Swardson's comedy routine is well-lighted and although backgrounds are kept simple, the good thing thing is that the comedy does show quite a bit of audience reaction with good shots at the audience.  Camera angles are either close up, body shot, at various positions towards the audience and way up high above the audience.  Editing is well-done.  Not dizzying at all.  Camera angle stays on the comedian for most of the time.Audio is featured in Dolby Digital.  I opted to have my receiver set at stereo on all channels in order to have the audio all around me.  But audio is understandable and clear.  Audience laughter is also quite clear and doesn't disturb Swardson's performance.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Nick Swardson - Seriously, Who Farted?"" comes with the following special features:* Opening Act: Beardo & Dirt Nasty - (7:39) Known for their narcotic/drug/sex-inspired music videos on ""Funny or Die"", Beardo & Dirt Nasty open Swardson's comedy show by performing a rock and a hip hop song.* 28 Drinks Later - (2:44) A trailer for a zombie film (or just a trailer) about Swardson and a few people who get drunk at a bar and awaken to find the whole city of Los Angeles turning to drunk zombies due to alcohol consumption.* Nick Swardson: Timeless Comedian - (7:12) Frazier Smith interviews Nick Swardson about his comedy and showcases his stand-up comedy since the 1920's.* A Very Terry Christmas - (2:21) Featuring Swardson's ""Reno 911' gay, roller skating character Terry singing Christmas songs.JUDGMENT CALL:Nick Swardson's comedy DVD ""Seriously, Who Farted?"" definitely showcases the comedian's love for beer and alcohol.  He loves it, repeats it and his comedy routine definitely works.  Especially for the audience who go crazy when he talks about alcohol or drugs.  College humor at its finest, I have to admit that I was so used to seeing Swardson on film and television that I never really seen his comedy routine.  I knew he was a funny guy but I didn't know he was a comedian.But watching ""Seriously, Who Farted?"", I couldn't help but laugh repeatedly.  His comedy is definitely understandable and can be easily appreciated by those familiar with the topics he discusses and the fact that he uses certain situations that reach a young crowd, discussions of XBOX 360 or Nintendo Wii is one thing, but for audiences who have been in a drunk stupor, are familiar with pot brownies, Asian massage parlors, UFC, ninjas and can laugh quite easily at monkeys, definitely will find Swardson's comedy DVD to be quite fun and refreshing.Sure, there are many drunk comedians but Swardson's comedy is quite hilarious because he's like the guy next door, the guy you went to college with, the guy you partied with... And I think what makes him so different from other comedians is the wacky roles he plays on films such as the gay skater in ""Reno 911', the guy who lives at home and never has success with women in ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" or the Dance Dance Revolution gamer in ""Grandma's Boy"".  Supporting roles that are just hilarious to watch and Swardson himself is just a funny comedian that will definitely make you laugh, pee in your pants or make you feel that you're going to bust a gut.  It's that hilarious!As for a Comedy Central DVD, you get the good camera angles but it would have been extra nice if this DVD release had been given the treatment of an audio CD (like Comedy Central's Russell Peters DVD release) because this is the kind of comedy that you would want to listen to in long commutes.Overall, Swardson's ""Seriously, Who Farted?"" is a hilarious comedy DVD worth checking out!",4,"Entertaining, fun and for those who enjoy stoner/bro-comedy, you'll dig this DVD!",1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,4759,"['Nick', 'Swardson', 'popular', 'young', 'comedian', 'known', 'roles',
