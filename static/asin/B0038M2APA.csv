After shooting a drug cartel hitman, Raylan is transferred away from a post in Miami and back to Lexington, KY, where he's hip-deep in crime in, you guessed it, Harlan County, the place he least wants to belong . . .but where he can operate better than anyone else--he's accepted.

Moved away long decades ago (military), and retired out West, but when I hear those accents and the Hill patois language, I can't help but watch.Gripes?  Realism, for one.  If any U.S. Marshall or other LEO shot as many folk as Raylan Givens does, he/she would get a one-way ticket out of law enforcement...just because of the liability concerns.Second, I do get tired of the stereotypes.  Heck, even the lawyers judges are painted as complete fools, and EVERY local LEO is ALWAYS corrupt.  There's some truth behind the stereotypes, of course, but a lot less these days than in past.Third, I just plain get tired of the frequent skin, intensely suggestive sexual dialogue, far too many naked butts, and just plain too much cussing.  I'd much rather they cleaned the series up a bit.  No, not completely...it is Harlan County, after all...but all too often such devices are used as stunts and filler to gloss over plot holes and miscues.  Come on, writers, you can do better than that.I would caution anyone with teens or kids to NOT watch the show with them...and make sure they aren't watching it behind your back.  The TV-MA rating is fully deserved for this series, and only mature adults should be watching.Finally, a plea to all you non-Hill people out there:  take Justified with a couple of huge grains of salt.  Don't make the mistake of confusing accents with intelligence.  Don't assume every hillbilly has their own still up the holler.

So, earlier this year when Amazon had a special on DVDs, I decided to purchase Season #1 along with many other purchases. One night, few weeks ago, I decided to check the series out on FX-TV and I must say, I became hooked on what I quickly learned was Season #4 which just ended. What a great show! Because I was so anxious to learn all about the characters and storylines that I had already missed, I IMMEDIATELY watched Season #1 (bought earlier) which I just finished and I must say that I am so outdone at how great this series is! I just ordered Seasons #2 and #3 which I now wish I had ordered before I finished Season #1. The actors and the writing are superb. Just when you think it cannot get any better, it does!!! I sincerely hope Season #4 is released by the time I finish Season #3. IMO, this is one of the most entertaining series on TV. As a former Chicago L.E.O.(Law Enforcement Officer as referred to in the series), I am not too impressed with many ""good guy/bad guy"" cop series. So I repeat.

1330679,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B0038M2APA,Brian C.,"[0, 0]","Wow, this show is surprisingly good. I was actually about half way through the first season and I was thinking to myself ""How is it possible this show is so well written?"" when I noticed, for the first time, in the opening credits that the show is based on works by Elmore Leonard. I do not mean to detract from the fabulous job the screen writer's have done adapting this for television but I am sure it helped a bit to have a solid base to work from. I admit, I have never read any of Leonard's books, though I have heard they are very well written, but I have seen a few of his movies, and there are two things that you can count on from Leonard: great characters and great dialogue. This show has both (more on that in a moment).In a way, the premise of the show sounds kind of silly to me. Essentially it is an attempt to transplant the old Western, with the fast drawing gunslinger, into modern times. The main character, a deputy U.S. Marshal named Raylan, has just been transferred back to his hometown in Kentucky after shooting someone under somewhat suspicious circumstances in Florida. Raylan is a fast draw and he gets himself into quite a few old Western style stand-off  situations. Like I said, that sounds a little bit silly on the face of it (do they still train Marshals to draw quickly and shoot without looking?) but it actually works really well. They do not get ridiculous with it. All of the quick draw situations Raylan finds himself in are believable. There are no high noon shootouts on Main Street.The show has a great cast of characters. The first season follows a story arc based around the Crowder family. The Crowder family are a bunch of criminals from Raylan's hometown and they make excellent and really interesting villains. Boyd Crowler, in particular, is a really interesting character, and the actor, Walton Goggins, does a superb job playing him. Raylan's father is also a very interesting character. There is a very strained relationship between Raylan and his father and the show handles it well. Usually shows like this run into problems dealing with strained family relationships. They wind up manufacturing a bunch of repetitive drama (the same arguments over and over) and then get very sentimental with it (the emotional blowup and reunion). This show avoids all of that. There were no cringe worthy scenes in this show, the kind that often feel like they come straight out of an introductory psychology textbook. That is surprisingly rare. Even some of my favorite shows have cringe worthy scenes here and there. This show, at least in the first season, which is all I have watched so far, had none.The show also has really well written dialogue. I watch a lot of procedurals and the dialogue on procedurals usually leaves a lot to be desired. A lot of shows, I think, wind up sacrificing quality for quantity. Shows that put out 24 episodes a season always feel a bit like they were made in a factory to me. The same scenes, with minor variations, show up in every episode. The dialogue is extremely repetitive (the same arguments over and over), a lot of the dialogue is just exposition (""so, here we are, at the gangsters hideout""), or filler. I am not sure if it is because they only have 13 episodes a season, or if they are using some of Leonard's original dialogue, or if they just have really talented screenwriter's, but the dialogue in this first season was really good.Another thing I appreciate about the show is that it often goes against cliches. I will just give one example of what I mean. There is a scene in one of the episodes where Raylan is drinking in the bar. We are far enough into the show to know that Raylan knows how to handle himself. There are two guys in the bar talking real loud, making crude remarks about some woman, and Raylan decides to confront them. This is a really familiar trope and most people, including me, immediately have certain expectations about where things are heading. The situation escalates and they decide to take things outside. This is where the two guys realize they picked a fight with the wrong person, right? Wrong. The show totally surprised me by having the two guys win the fight. Raylan gets beat up.That might seem like a really minor thing but very few shows would have been willing to have their hero lose a fight like that. You are never supposed to perceive any weakness in the hero. Not only is that unrealistic but it is boring. I really appreciated that this show was willing to frustrate the viewer's expectations.

I think I have found it...I first heard about Justified on a forum I belong to and it intrigued me immediately. I decided to take a gamble and purchase the first season (the local satellite is already on the second season and I'd missed Season one) from Amazon.Well, I have not been disappointed. I was already a fan of Timothy Olyphant but it is the presence of Elmore Leonard, one of the great dialogue writers of the crime genre, and the fine writing of the show that really makes it worthwhile. The dialogue is superb, echoing the sly genius of Leonard's novels, without attempting to be a lame copy of it. It is also very funny.The characters are keenly sketched, the locations are well chosen and the fascinating, incestuous culture of the Kentucky backwoods adds a rich, smoky texture to the whole deal, like good BBQ chased down by a fine, rare bourbon.Of course the real cherry on the cake is Walton Goggins. Any fan of The Shield knows the skills this fine actor has and his Boyd character is one of the real delights of the series. Walton has really come into his own here.I just hope the show garners enough of a fanbase so that the networks dont consider cancelling it prematurely.

This show is based on an Elmore Leonard short story, and Elmore was more than a little involved in the production of this series. Anyone familiar with Elmore knows dialogue is key, and there is plenty of clever scriptwriting to go around. The production people for the show write the bulk of the scripts, but they have a Leonard flavor to their works. The acting is great without being stereotypical of Southern folk. Dewey Crowe (played by Damon Herriman) is my favorite character (he was evicted from church camp for masterbating too much, an ""onanist""). He's as dumb as they come, but Herriman plays it so well. Tim Olyphant, as Raylan Givens, is the quirkiest U.S. Marshall in modern day Kentucky. He's more lethal than a rattlesnake with a sidearm, yet quick to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh, and he is definitely not the sharpest knife in the drawer. Thank Heavens Olyphant doesn't play his role as Clint Eastwood, as he did in the HBO series ""Deadwood"" (one of the best Western TV series ever aired). This series has a definite Western movie feel to it. I miss a good Western, and this show has all the elements in spades. Walton Coggins does an exceptional job as Givens' adversary and sometimes friend. The women (Joelle Carter as Eva, Erica Tazel as Rachel Brooks, a U.S. Marshall, and Natalie ZEa as Raylan Givens' ex-wife) are all really pretty, and strong, and self-reliant. I wish season two would hurry up and finalize so I can get that one too. The 4 commentaries on the 3-disk set are fun and informative without being drawn out and dull.

He gets reassigned to East Kentucky, and you have a great series-Justified.Raylan Givens, portrayed by Timothy Olyphant, brings a touch of the Old West to Eastern Kentucky. In the pilot episode-Fire In The Hole-you wonder if this young man is trigger happy or just plain angry or both?  His philosophy is-if the bad guy draws first, then the shooting is justified.Complicating his life is his ex-wife, Winona, who is a court reporter in Lexington, the home base of the marshal service. She's married to a land developer who is hiding something-this becomes a basis of a continual story line.An old friend, Boyd Crowder, is involved in some bad stuff.  Of course, the two old mining buddies face off and this becomes a continual sort of tension, especially when Crowder gets religion in prison and is released by the US Attorney because of Givens' involvement with Crowder's sister in law, Ava Crowder, who killed Boyd's brother at the kitchen table in the pilot.In essence this series so far in 13 episodes is about two sons and two old friends.  They have father issues, and their friendship is tested beyond measure for Boyd appears to be on the opposite end of the spectrum from Raylan.  Raylan is unconvinced of Boyd's religious conversion.The two old friends confront their fathers in different ways in the season finale-Bulletville. Raylan has to trust Boyd with more than his life as the final showdown takes place in one of the most spectacular gunfights that I have seen in series television.My favorite episode is Hatless.  Bulletville is almost equal as well.  For in Hatless you have Raylan facing his past and looking at himself in the mirror of yesterday.  Bulletville brings the previous 12 episodes to some climatic conclusions.The only major flaw is the location.  Eastern Kentucky is a beautiful place.  Shooting in Pennsylvania location scenes is not the same as Eastern Kentucky.

Hitman was poorly conceived start to finish and that Die Hard film was so stupidly over the top that his poorly developed character just came across as non-threatening.

1331013,A1LW3XGXYP98BW,B0038M2APA,H. Pace,"[1, 1]","Justified is the story of deputy U.S. marshal Raylan Givens.  We quickly learn a couple major facts about Raylan in the pilot when he shoots a Miami cartel captain in a crowded restaurant and is subsequently re-assigned back to eastern Kentucky as punishment.  Raylan isn't afraid to use his gun, and he has serious issues with his hometown.  Justified is a modern western and more serial drama than procedural.The pilot is based on Elmore Leonard short story (Fire in the Hole) and it shows.  One of the greatest TV pilots I've ever seen, it's like an entire novel in 44 minutes.The title, Justified, refers to the justification for the various shootings Raylan is responsible for.  Raylan Givens is not a cop willing to step over any line for professional or personal reasons, a la Vic Mackey.  True to the title of the show, his shootings are always legally justified.  But while they keep to the letter of the law, they surely do not keep to its spirit.  In the very first scene of the series, the Miami cartel captain that Raylan shoots only pulls first because Raylan has promised to kill him and the deadline is seconds away.  Was it really justified to shoot a man after giving him 24 hours to leave town or die, even if he pulled first?  But Raylan IS a man with a code, explored most searchingly in The Hammer.  Raylan may make it look it, but his is not as easy road, as Rachel finds out in Long in the Tooth and Judge Mike ""The Hammer"" Reardan finds out in The Hammer.  Other major themes are family and Raylan's nihilism. The empathy he has for his adversaries serves him as well as his quick trigger finger.Justified is full of the witty dialogue for which Leonard is known.  Raylan, Boyd, and Ava are all wonderfully well drawn.  Raylan's co-workers Tim and Rachel suffer from a lack of attention, but are compelling to the extent possible given the limited attention they are given.  Raylan's boss Art, his ex-wife Winona, and her new husband Gary are all 3-dimensional minor characters.Like many drama series today, Justified attempts to balance between more traditional procedural episodes and episodes that directly tie into a larger, season-long narrative arc.  Much like Terriers, another underappreciated serial drama on FX, season one of Justified sets up the season-long arc in the pilot, pulls away from it for one-off episodes in rest of the first half of the season, then returns to it in the second half of the season, building to a season finale climax.  It comes off a bit clumsy everywhere I have seen it done, but Justified pulls it off well enough.The state of Kentucky is a character in Justified.  This is not a story that could have taken place anywhere but just happens to be set in Kentucky.  It is at its heart a story about Kentucky and specifically eastern, Appalachian, coal-mining Kentucky.  It could not have been set anywhere else.  The driving force of the show is not Raylan's conflicts with lawbreakers, but his inner conflict from being pulled in one direction by his family and his roots and another by his morals and his chosen life.Unlike most movies and TV shows, the southern accents sound right.  Perhaps it's not surprising, as Walton Goggins (Boyd Crowder) was raised in Georgia and Nick Searcy (Deputy Chief Nick Mullen) is from the mountains of North Carolina.DVD extras:  The commentary sometimes veers into Elmore Leonard-hero worship and mutual backslapping and inside, incomprehensible jokes, but it is nonetheless laden with golden nuggets of insight, in particular about the adaptation of the Leonard short story Fire in the Hole for the pilot.

1331055,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B0038M2APA,Jason Bean,"[12, 13]","'Justified' is a TV series about U.S. Marshall Raylan Givens, a character created by Elmore Leonard and is expanded from his short story 'Fire in the Hole!'. While the premise of the show seems by-the-numbers, it carries itself in a unique direction away from the usual crime series.After a shooting in Miami, Marshall Raylan Givens is reassigned to his hometown in Harlan County, Kentucky. The series progresses in an episodic manner as we learn more about Raylan's background and about the people he runs into on the job. These episode-to-episode plots may not sit well with some viewers accustomed to long story arcs, but the writers of this series keep things on an unpredictable level and I found each stand-alone episode engaging and watchable. It also helps that, though we do get some exposition on his co-workers the stories are (wisely)centered on Raylan himself. He's a great character to watch and the writers never forget that the show's about him.Speaking of the writing, the dialogue of this show is VERY sharp. There's still gun-fire aplenty in each episode (along with some well-staged shoot-outs) but it's the dialogue that moves the plot along. I really can't say that about any other crime show and that's REALLY what makes Justified stand apart from the rest.The dialogue of course wouldn't work as well as does if it didn't have terrific actors to deliver it. Timothy Olyphant proved in 'Deadwood' that he had the acting chops to carry his own show and he towers above all in 'Justified'. Equally good is Walton Goggins who (more-or-less) seems the show's chief antagnost. It's the crossroads that these two characters come to that electrifies this season's final episodes.This first season DVD comes with a decent amount of extras. The cast talking about their characters is nothing new to people who've been following this show online, but the commentaries (on select episodes) are pretty good with insights not only into the stories and characters (and the influence by Elmore Leonard) but the little details about the real U.S. Marshals.While Justified probably won't be everyone's taste I recommend everyone give it a try. With so many shows on networks recycling the same formula (from Soprano's or the Shield) it's nice to see a series like 'Justified' taking things in a slightly different direction.

Clemons ""clotblaster""","[1, 5]","This show has received a lot of effusive praise from those people who consider themselves a cut or two above the average t.v. viewer. ""Justified"" has some fine acting and very good production values. Nevertheless, the plot is contrived and bestows hero status on a lawman that supposedly grew up in the South, but comes across vividly as a typical northeastern character, dressed up superficially as a southerner. The main problem with the show is the obvious fact that the bad guys in the south would have killed the beafied marshal and ended is noble crusade against the fatuous people of the south. Timothy Olyphant is a problematic actor--in Deadwood he brought his character to life and was more or less convincing.  In Justified, he lacks the acting skills to transcend the flat character, created by the authors/producers of this show. Most of the time he has this confident, bordering on smug, look on his face that asks the viewer to consider him a really bad-ass who takes no guff from anyone. Although Walton Goggins, who plays the half-crazed villain (who likes to blow things up or start and watch fires) is excellent in his role, he still in essence is just another hillbilly hick that all discerning viewers should look down on. Also, it beggars belief to think that the marshal's ex-wife would marry such a milquetoast loser.

It's my favorite show, best since Sopranos, and if you've never seen it do yourself a favor and give it a look.  The writing, some of which is based on the work of the great Elmore Leonard, is exceptional and the acting is topnotch.  Shining as bright as the lawman's star he wears is Timothy Olyphant, so perfect as Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens that after viewing a few episodes it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role.  Olyphant brings Givens to life as a heroic, yet very human character who's as likeable as they come.  He's surrounded by a great supporting cast, not the least of whom is Walton Goggins as Raylan's nemesis Boyd Crowder.  All thirteen episodes of the inaugural season are worth watching, with some being especially noteworthy.  The pilot is outstanding, introducing the players with the emphasis on Givens and exploring some of what makes him tick while also leaving some unanswered questions about this most interesting character.  Episode 4 is a personal favorite of mine, focusing on Raylan's pursuit of a fugitive and featuring a really neat desert showdown between our hero and a couple of hitmen.  Some of the episodes can stand on their own, while others are more serialized, but whatever your preference the more you watch the more you cannot wait to see what happens next.  Justified has drama and action, romance and laughs, and overall it's a real dandy of a show that is well worth watching.

I was coming off watching some classic TV like The Wire and Sopranos, and I was probably too hard on this one. Changing Two Stars to Three and a half. A solid and fairly well done show that gets better (in my opinion) at the end of the first season.***My Original Review*** My favorite shows have big themes and go for big concepts: The Sopranos, The Wire, The Shield, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Damages, Deadwood, even Dexter.I watched the first seven episodes of Justified and found it to be typical run-of-the-mill television fare with lot's of cliches, poor writing, complete lack of realism, stereotypical characters, etc. Olyphant is enjoyable to watch but if I'm going to watch TV I need better quality.Maybe I'm a TV snob. The first show seemed to be based on Elmore Leonard's short story and I liked it. But the writing took a nose dive after that first episode, and I quickly found myself wondering if the subsequent episodes were going to get better. In my opinion, they did not.I can't help feeling a show based in Kentucky or Appalachia could have gone the route of say, ""Winters Bone"", with colorful rural (but realistic) characters, themes of poverty, coal mining, isolation, etc. ***SPOILER ALERT***: When Olyphant stood his ground with a sawed off shotgun aimed at him at point blank range and walked up and snatched it away from the bad guy, I completely lost interest in the show. Utterly simpleminded and ridiculous writing without an ounce of credibility.The episode about the rich guy and the evil wife and the ""Hitler"" paintings...  cut me a break. ***SPOILER ALERT***: She marries the guy for his money and then kills him and plans to run away.

The problem was that I kind of came in somewhere in the middle and had no control on what I was watching.  Then I signed up for Amazon Channel on ROKU and became really excited when I saw that I could watch every episode right from the Pilot forward and learn the characters and watch the whole story unfold.  Unfortunately this was going to cost me $2.99 per episode.  Then I discovered that I could watch it free if I joined Amazon Prime.  That decision quickly became a no-brainer since I buy quite a bit on Amazon.com and this would also give me free 2 day shipping on most of my purchases and I would no longer have to spend $25 for free shipping.

1331174,A2D3L9CJZCN7UY,B0038M2APA,"Kansas_Jones ""He's Dead Jim""","[8, 9]","Timothy Olymphant is Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens, a dedicated Marshall who is also a fast draw when he has to be. He is rotated back to take a duty posting in his home state of Kentucky -- a decision that he isn't right fond of, but soon discovers there is plenty of cleaning up to do in Kentucky that requires his own particular style.I've watched Season One from the Pilot all the way through the Season finale. I'll straight up say that ""Justified"" is quality TV entertainment. Take the modern adult oriented police procedural and combine it with a classic TV western, and there's your ""Justified"".The cast is strong, big time strong. Olymphant just rolls right along with the lead part, but he's surrounded by a supporting cast (and guest cast) that just immerse the viewer. Favorites include Nick Searcy as Art Mullen (Chief Deputy), a relatively easy going boss until you get him riled, and Raymond J. Barry (Arlo Givens), Raylan's father who has a big time checkered past and we as viewers still don't know it he'll ever be on the level with his son. I won't even get into the woman cast members, but suffice to say they *all* kick you know what and take big time names. ""Aunt Helen"" (who is now married to Arlo and played by Natalie Zea) is a tough, protective sort who brandishes a shot gun like every other episode and I'm surprised she hasn't hauled off and shot someone yet (and that one truck doesn't count, as she was at a distance.....)The show also has its own laid back humor, which is awesome. There is such as thing as a show taking itself too seriously, and thankfully ""Justified"" gives us the best of both worlds.The set Locations are a combination of modern housing, backwoods/country housing, and rough and tumble hill country - the viewer is immersed in the locations and the show through the characters as we are shown where they live.As for the Old West TV meets modern police show, three of the main cast members were trapped in a backwoods cabin while the ""bad guys"" peppered it with automatic weapons fire during the Season finale...How many time have we seen that scene in past westerns, and you can't get more Old West then that! As usual, ""Justified"" had it's own take on the situation, and that Rocks Out!If you like the police procedural, ensemble cast shows, or might want to check out a show centering on a modern US Marshals office in the Kentucky Hill territory, then I recommend the DVD set of the first season of ""Justified"".",5,"Marshall Dillon, Meet Modern West",1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,2469,"['Timothy', 'Olymphant', 'Deputy', 'US', 'Marshal', 'Raylan', 'Givens', 'dedicated', 'Marshall', 'who', 'also', 'fast', 'draw', 'when', 'be', 'rotated', 'back', 'take', 'duty', 'posting', 'home', 'state', 'Kentucky', 'decision', ""n't"", 'right', 'fond', 'soon', 'discovers', 'plenty', 'cleaning', 'up', 'do', 'Kentucky', 'own', 'particular', 'style.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Season', 'One', 'Pilot', 'way', 'Season', 'finale', ""'ll"", 'straight', 'up', 'say', 'Justified', 'quality', 'TV', 'entertainment', 'Take', 'modern', 'adult', 'oriented', 'police', 'procedural', 'combine', 'classic', 'TV', 'western', 'Justified', '.The', 'cast', 'strong', 'big', 'time', 'strong', 'Olymphant', 'just', 'rolls', 'right', 'lead', 'part', 'surrounded', 'supporting', 'cast', 'guest', 'cast', 'just', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'Favorites', 'include', 'Nick', 'Searcy', 'Art', 'Mullen', 'Chief', 'Deputy', 'relatively', 'easy', 'going', 'boss', 'get', 'riled', 'Raymond', 'J.', 'Barry', 'Arlo', 'Givens', 'Raylan', 'father', 'who', 'big', 'time', 'checkered', 'past', 'viewers', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'be', 'level', 'son', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'woman', 'cast', 'members', 'suffice', 'say', '*all*', 'kick', 'know', 'what', 'take', 'big', 'time', 'names', 'Aunt', 'Helen', 'who', 'now', 'married', 'Arlo', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Zea', 'tough', 'protective', 'sort', 'who', 'shot', 'gun', 'other', 'episode', ""'m"", 'surprised', ""n't"", 'hauled', 'off', 'shot', 'someone', 'yet', 'one', 'truck', ""n't"", 'count', 'was', 'distance', '..', 'show', 'also', 'own', 'laid', 'back', 'humor', 'awesome', 'such', 'thing', 'show', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'thankfully', 'Justified', 'best', 'worlds.The', 'set', 'Locations', 'are', 'combination', 'modern', 'housing', 'backwoods/country', 'housing', 'rough', 'tumble', 'hill', 'country', 'viewer', 'immersed', 'locations', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'where', 'live.As', 'Old', 'West', 'TV', 'meets', 'modern', 'police', 'show', 'three', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'trapped', 'backwoods', 'cabin', 'bad', 'guys', 'peppered', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'fire', 'Season', 'finale', 'How', 'many', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'scene', 'past', 'westerns', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'Old', 'West', 'then', 'that', 'usual', 'Justified', 'had', 'own', 'take', 'situation', 'Out', 'like', 'police', 'procedural', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'shows', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'show', 'centering', 'modern', 'US', 'Marshals', 'office', 'Kentucky', 'Hill', 'territory', 'then', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'Justified']",Justified: Season 1

Well written, intelligent, subtle (where plot is concerned), unpredictable with actors who do not seem to be in constant ""pose"" mode.Based on the work of Elmore Leonard, it definitely carries on Leonard's tradition of colorful and unpredictable characters while not getting so lost in ""flavor"" that the story suffers.  The production is very lucky indeed to have Timothy Olyphant on board, bringing a certain hard-to-describe low key charisma to his role, much as he did in ""Deadwood"".  In fact, his character in ""Justified"" has many similarities to his ""Deadwood"" ancestor - angry, gun-totin', does-not-suffer-fools and if-he-says-it-he-means-it.The supporting cast is equally up to the task (look closely for some ""Deadwood"" alumni).  The writing is great, but you have to have the talent to deliver it.  ""Justified"" does have the talent.  If you are in the market for a modern day western that throws off many of the tried and true modern day predictabilities, ""Justified"" is highly recommended.NOTE: If you buy the DVD set, BEWARE of the special features on disc 2.  A LUNKHEAD DUFUS producer gives away one of the key plot elements from the final episode.  How the folks who put together the DVD, and how a successful supposedly smart but ultimately LUNKHEAD DUFUS producer, could screw up this badly is beyond me.

It's not all bad but it certainly seems to fall short in some way. All season I kept waiting for it to explode like ""The Shield"" or like ""Sons of Anarchy"", FX's two best action series. I had watched the previews and waited with great anticipation for this series as the premise looked awesome. I adore Timothy Olyphant as an actor ever since he was the sherrif on ""Dead Wood"". He is something special and deserves a better written series. Being created by the same people as ""The Shield"" I expected it to be darker, grittier, action packed and filled with alot of suspense like the above mentioned show, but ""Justified is a bit slow, like molasses on a cold day. It is interesting at times and I think has great potential, but I was disappointed with it. It never seems to go far enough. Each episode clears up a crime like a cheesy CSI spin-off. Toward the end things began picking up with the conflict escalating between he and Boyd and his family. I am not a fan of a weekly series of any kind that wraps up all loose ends, solves the case and puts the bad guy away all by the end of the hour. This show could be so much more and I will certainly give it another chance when it airs again. I like Sherrif Rayland and find him charming, funny and tough. As a viewer I have watched all of the other shows FX has created and know they can do better. Normally their series leave me on the edge of my seat and both my husband and I look forward to their programming, some of the best on television. ""The Riches"", ""Nip Tuck"", ""Rescue Me"", ""Dirt"", ""Sons Of Anarchy"" the new ""Terriers"" that kicks butt and of course the BEST cop drama of all time ""The Shield"". That is quite the line up of super quality shows and ""Justified"" needs a little punch to get it in the same category as these shows. All in all I hope the show does a bit better this season and expands in a couple of new directions. The acting is well done, really it is more of a storyline issue.

Timothy Olyphant is pitch-perfect as Raylan Givens, a modern gunslinger who's the hero of this story, but also a flawed man.  Olyphant can ""wear a hat and shoot a gun"" (creator Graham Yost's words), but the rest of the cast is great.  Walton Goggins is so good as Boyd Crowder that his character got a reprieve (he was supposed to die at the end of the pilot), and actors like MC Gainey (Bo Crowder), Raymond J. Barry (Arlo Givens), Joelle Carter (Ava Crowder), and Jacob Pitts (Tim Gutterson) are splendid.  Special mention must be made of Nick Searcy as Chief Deputy Art Mullen.  He's so perfect it seems as though this role has just been waiting around for him to find it.  Add in special guest stars like Stephen Root, William Ragsdale, Alan Ruck (in ""Long in the Tooth,"" one of the best episodes), and especially Jere Burns as one of the creepiest bad guys around, and the acting is obviously in good hands.The writing is sharp and observant.  The show taps into one of the funniest facets of Leonard's writings, namely that most criminals really aren't very smart.  Dry humor and tart dialogue abound.  Like all great crime dramas, everyone has a motivation.  Even the worst characters have personalities with wants and desires that direct them rather than the writer's whim.  The incorporation of the Dixie Mafia and the redneck drug empires that exist in out-of-the-way hollows of lower/working class America give Justified a grit and pace that have a different feel than most LA/New York based cop show/procedurals.This is a tremendous show, revolving around a character summed up by Chief Deputy Mullen (in season 2):  ""Raylan, you're a terrible Marshal and a good lawman.""",5,Rip-roaring action and great characters to boot,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,1809,"['Justified', 'latest', 'offering', 'FX', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'worthy', 'association', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'pitch-perfect', 'Raylan', 'Givens', 'modern', 'gunslinger', 'who', 'hero', 'story', 'also', 'flawed', 'man', 'can', 'wear', 'hat', 'shoot', 'gun', 'creator', 'Graham', 'Yost', 'words', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'so', 'good', 'Boyd', 'Crowder', 'character', 'got', 'reprieve', 'was', 'supposed', 'die', 'end', 'pilot', 'actors', 'MC', 'Gainey', 'Bo', 'Crowder', 'Raymond', 'J.', 'Barry', 'Arlo', 'Givens', 'Joelle', 'Carter', 'Ava', 'Crowder', 'Jacob', 'Pitts', 'Tim', 'Gutterson', 'are', 'splendid', 'Special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'Nick', 'Searcy', 'Chief', 'Deputy', 'Art', 'Mullen', 'so', 'perfect', 'role', 'just', 'been', 'waiting', 'around', 'find', 'Add', 'special', 'guest', 'stars', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'William', 'Ragsdale', 'Alan', 'Ruck', 'Long', 'Tooth', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'especially', 'Jere', 'Burns', 'one', 'creepiest', 'bad', 'guys', 'acting', 'obviously', 'good', 'hands.The', 'writing', 'sharp', 'observant', 'show', 'one', 'funniest', 'facets', 'Leonard', 'writings', 'namely', 'most', 'criminals', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'smart', 'Dry', 'humor', 'tart', 'dialogue', 'abound', 'great', 'crime', 'dramas', 'everyone', 'motivation', 'Even', 'worst', 'characters', 'have', 'personalities', 'direct', 'rather', 'writer', 'whim', 'incorporation', 'Dixie', 'Mafia', 'redneck', 'drug', 'exist', 'out-of-the-way', 'hollows', 'lower/working', 'class', 'America', 'give', 'Justified', 'grit', 'pace', 'have', 'different', 'feel', 'most', 'LA/New', 'York', 'based', 'cop', 'show/procedurals.This', 'tremendous', 'show', 'revolving', 'character', 'summed', 'up', 'Chief', 'Deputy', 'Mullen', 'season', '2', 'Raylan', ""'re"", 'terrible', 'Marshal', 'good', 'lawman']",Justified: Season 1

1331464,A49DXD4WVLSLL,B0038M2APA,Paul Brooks,"[0, 0]","Justified - Season 1 - [2014-01-31 500]Summary:Raylan Givens, U.S. Marshal has a problem. He's a trouble magnet, which result in bodies being piled up much to the consternation of his superiors. After a shootout in Miami - where a drug kingpin was killed - he is sent to Kentucky near Harlan County - noted for it's crime families, drugs, moonshine and, not incidentally deep family associations with Marshall Givens.Content:The Season One package consists of 3 disks and 13 episodes originally shown on the FX network starting March 16, 2010. Also included are several special features on disk 3 that I founding very interesting and added to my enjoyment and understanding of what the creative types wished to accomplish. Unfortunately there was no &#34;special feature&#34; on Elmore Leonard the real genius behind the series.Positive Comments:This is a fascinating show with an excellent cast of well-developed characters. I was never bored and except for a few random occasions felt that the narrative was logical and reasonably believable.The Cast:The two main male leads are exceptional. Timothy Olyphant as Marshal Raylan Givens brings a sexy swagger to the role of a self-assured lawman that must contend with his dysfunctional family and community. Walton Goggins as Boyd Crowder is mesmerizing as the man who miraculously returned from apparent death with a shot to the chest courtesy of Marshal Givens. Boyd has morphed into a charismatic mystic with a hatred for drug dealers.Negative Comments: No deleted or extended scenes. Sometimes these are almost as enjoyable as the episode - and I'm next too positive they exist - but not even one was included in the season 1 boxed set! The female interest appears to be motivated by their hormones rather than their intellect. Both ladies just can't hold back from jumping in the sack with Raylan much to his determent. Yes a moment's pleasure but a full bucket of woe! Don't ever think of missing a week of this show since the season's story unfolds from episode to episode. Characters pop up from two or three shows ago and plot threads are pulled and expanded from several episodes back. This is not necessarily a negative unless you have no intention of ponying up for the full season set or won't watch it on pay per view. In that case you will have a difficult time following all the story lines..

1331548,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0038M2APA,Robert Moore,"[9, 12]","I have to confess that I was not that impressed by JUSTIFIED at the beginning.  The first few episodes were good, but it did not at the out start have a compelling long term arc, or rather didn't obviously have one.  I simply won't watch shows that don't tell an overarching story over the course of the series.  Nothing makes me lose interest in a show more quickly than a succession of stand alone episodes, which is one reason that I have virtually no interest in pre-1990 television (with rare exceptions, like THE PRISONER and TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY and THE TWILIGHT ZONE and MONTY PYTHON).  But with the gradual development of long story arc television in the eighties, TV transformed from a media that I had virtually no interest in to one that I prefer strongly over the movies (and this from someone who ran a couple of film societies in grad school).So, my fear was that JUSTIFIED was going to be a series of standalones.  But luckily, it developed a great ongoing storyline with a surprisingly likable cast.The writing for the show wasn't quite as sharp as for shows like THE SHIELD and THE WIRE, but it was strong by the standard of most shows, and the cast was exceptional.  I had always wanted to see Timothy Olyphant in another story after the prematurely cancelled DEADWOOD, in which his extraordinary performance was sometimes overlooked by a host of equally strong characters.  Here Olyphant comes into his own and his portrayal of Raylan Givens made him perhaps the most enjoyable lawman on television at the moment.  Wayne Goggins proved in THE SHIELD that he was one of the best actors on television and he proves it again here in this one as an exceptionally complex southern redneck who is in turn a white supremacist, criminal, drug dealer, religious zealot, and reformer.  Even at the end of the season it is hard to classify him as a good or bad guy.  A lesser actor might not be able to pull it off, but Goggins nails it.My recommendation for anyone who tries this but isn't immediately delighted with it:  give it a chance.  It will definitely repay your interest and I'm sure that most viewers will enjoy Raylan Givens as much as I do.",5,Completely won me over by the end of the season,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,2167,"['have', 'confess', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'JUSTIFIED', 'beginning', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'out', 'start', 'have', 'compelling', 'long', 'term', 'arc', 'rather', 'did', ""n't"", 'obviously', 'have', 'one', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'overarching', 'story', 'course', 'series', 'Nothing', 'lose', 'interest', 'show', 'more', 'quickly', 'succession', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'one', 'reason', 'have', 'virtually', 'interest', 'pre-1990', 'television', 'rare', 'exceptions', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'TINKER', 'TAILOR', 'SOLDIER', 'SPY', 'THE', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'MONTY', 'PYTHON', 'gradual', 'development', 'long', 'story', 'arc', 'television', 'eighties', 'TV', 'transformed', 'media', 'had', 'virtually', 'interest', 'one', 'prefer', 'strongly', 'movies', 'someone', 'who', 'ran', 'couple', 'film', 'societies', 'grad', 'school', '.So', 'fear', 'was', 'JUSTIFIED', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'series', 'standalones', 'luckily', 'developed', 'great', 'ongoing', 'storyline', 'surprisingly', 'likable', 'cast.The', 'writing', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'sharp', 'shows', 'THE', 'SHIELD', 'THE', 'WIRE', 'was', 'strong', 'standard', 'most', 'shows', 'cast', 'was', 'exceptional', 'had', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'story', 'prematurely', 'cancelled', 'DEADWOOD', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'was', 'sometimes', 'overlooked', 'host', 'equally', 'strong', 'characters', 'Here', 'Olyphant', 'own', 'portrayal', 'Raylan', 'Givens', 'made', 'perhaps', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'lawman', 'television', 'moment', 'Wayne', 'Goggins', 'proved', 'THE', 'SHIELD', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'television', 'again', 'here', 'one', 'exceptionally', 'complex', 'southern', 'redneck', 'who', 'turn', 'white', 'supremacist', 'criminal', 'drug', 'dealer', 'religious', 'zealot', 'reformer', 'Even', 'end', 'season', 'hard', 'classify', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'lesser', 'actor', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'Goggins', 'it.My', 'recommendation', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'delighted', 'give', 'chance', 'will', 'definitely', 'repay', 'interest', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Raylan', 'Givens', 'as', 'much', 'do']",Justified: Season 1

1331565,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B0038M2APA,Ron,"[12, 17]","So far after only watching the pilot for this FX Network series I can honestly say we have yet another cookie cutter show! How can I say such a thing you might ask? Well lets start with the basics like the formula for the lead character Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) U.S. Marshal. Is he a rogue lawman? Yes. Does he have at least one parent who's a criminal? Yes, his father. Does he have anger issues? Yes. Does he have other baggage? Yes he does. Does he dress like fellow marshals? No, he has his own uniform style including being unshaven. Does he carry a regulation firearm? No, he uses a multitude of weapons. Whats his trademark? He is a throwback to the 1800's when someone draws down first and you kill/wound them ""Its Justified"" Can he get the ladies? Why yes he can. Is he always in trouble with his boss and the DOJ? Yes he is. Is he the one person they have to call upon to get the job done? Yes he is. The acting, locations and direction all seem to rate in the good range and the writing from the pilot appeared to land in the middle of the pack range for TV programs. Was it a waste of time to watch? No, but the worn formula is the same as so many others that came before it and most likely after it too. Is it entertaining? Mildly. 3 StarsRating 0 to 5 StarsStory = 3 Pretty standard material and characters here.Acting = 3+Direction = 3+Action = 3 Gun play and an explosion.Violence = 2+ Gun stock hits to the head and a elbow or two.Foul Language = 1 Light and not as much as many others.Gets much worse with each episode. 4+Entertainment Value = 3 Its not bad, but its based on a tired and overused formula. If everything else is a rerun then watch this until new programing restarts.Ps. I will continue to watch this show from time to time when time allows to see how it and its characters evolve with each passing season.Ps. Part II I have watched the first four seasons now and have somewhat changed my opinion on the show. The character development is good and will give an idea of the mindset between the main characters and their relationships/interactions with one anotherThe acting is good for the most part with a few exceptions from the secondary characters. The dialogue seems fitting for the region, but can get a little on the foul side from time to time and the stories are entertaining although they tend to be very predictable. There is plenty of violence to satisfy diehard fans and the occasional partial rear view nudity shots of male and female characters. I do enjoy watching the show if I can't find something else that I would rather of watched and spent my time on.The shows standard well worn formula and its predictability is what hurts the shows performance and shoots itself in the foot keeping it from being a runaway hit. I know that I'm in the minority with my 3 star review, but it just lacks any kind of originality and is way to predictable and not thought provoking enough!

Woodward,"[0, 0]","We are a crime drama nation and when I saw still yet another crime drama rife with cliche's like cowboy hats, Kentucky jargon, and US Marshalls come along I hesitated to give it a try.  The pilot even begins with a cliche draw-and-shoot dramatic scene, but that's as far as this series goes to be cliche.  Right from the very first scene the writing and acting are perfectly in sync. The writers know the characters and the actors protray the writers scenes superbly.  Even though the introductory sub-plot is mandatorially covered in the pilot, it feels like an episode someplace in the second season it is done so well.  The pace of the show is set perfectly in the pilot as well, and it is kept uniform through season 1 without a hitch.  I get a strong feeling from watching this series it that not only are the character roles respected by the writers and actors, the viewer is given a strong respect as well.  That alone is refreshing in a crime drama.  This is not a cookie cutter show.This is no season launch with the actors fumbling around for character development either.  Each scene is portrayed and painstakingly blocked and depicted in detail - right down to the stenciled name on the prison sheets and the coal miner accents.  The show comes into our living rooms with just the right amount of personal touch.  Just two characters in a room talking will engage the viewer with believable dialogue - an outcome of numerous read-throughs and actors understanding their roles no doubt.The set detail, location shoots, and production quality are the very best on TV today.  The actors, writing and plots are well done and carefully avoid formulaic dramadies.  The lead (Timothy Olyphant) is well on his way to being a big big star with his work on this series.

He could not stop raving about Justified, comparing it to his other all-time favorite show, The Wire.  So I started watching and was immediately hooked.  Here's why.  Although it's set in Kentucky, and the characters are self-professed &#34;hillbillies,&#34; they are smartly written, clever and funny.  There are a few &#34;Dukes of Hazzard&#34; types -- but they are recognized as being dumb by the other characters, not put forward to the audience as the norm for people in this part of the country.  The bad guys, as in The Wire, are finely drawn; sometimes you root for them, other times, you cringe at how evil they are.  Walton Goggins' &#34;Boyd&#34; character is a prime example.  At first glance, you think he's some Aryan Nation dumb redneck who just likes to blow stuff up, but you quickly come to realize that he's MUCH more complex than that.  He has a &#34;maybe redemption/maybe not&#34; storyline all through Season One that is beautifully written.The star of the show, Timothy Olyphant, is brilliant, and his character is amazing. Raylan Givens is a great character:  also smart, flawed, sarcastic, and loyal, both to the US Marshal Service and to his hillbilly roots.  It's an exeptional show that has you rooting for both the lawman AND the villain.In terms of storyline, the series is clearly written by someone from Kentucky or a place like it.  The dialogue is authentic -- and often laugh out loud funny --  and the characters ring true.  The show is realistically violent, and because it's basic cable, the language is adult, but it's not gratuitous like something on HBO or Showtime.I'm deep into Season Two, and the quality is still terrific.  I like well-written, gritty, (fictonally) realistic crime shows like The Wire, and Breaking Bad.  Justified is right up there with those two shows.

With FX, original series can be either hit (Nip/Tuck, Dirt) or miss (The Riches). Justified is a show I normally wouldn't have looked at even once. Being a city girl at heart, I'm not a fan of westerns or anything country. One thing I am a fan of is Timothy Olyphant. When I saw one of my favorite actors (brilliant in ""Hitman"") was going to be in a new show, I of course had to watch. A pleasant surprise awaited me.It's as if Timothy Olyphant was born to be US Marshal Raylan Givens, a good ol' country boy with personal issues. After shooting a man in Miami old west style (""It was justified""), Raylan is punished by being sent back to his old home town in Kentucky to work the local cases, many involving people he knows. His estranged father, former best-friend-turned-criminal, an old flame and a complicated ex wife round out the engaging cast of colorful characters. Raylan has a reputation for being a bit trigger-happy, a branding he hardly thinks is fair (""only if it's justified""). He is never without his 10 gallon hat (unless someone steals it), he can talk down a hostage situation with whiskey and a bucket of fried chicken, or shoot a guy for ""taking one more step"". It's all in a day's work for Raylan.Justified is one of those shows that makes you forget you're watching a show being acted by actors. It's as though you are observing actual people live their lives. I feel like I'm in the scene, watching everything unfold before me. The dialogue is fresh, gritty, real and absolutely hilarious. The characters bounce between utterly ridiculous and completely relatable. And the actors, everyone from the main stars to the day players are right on the money.If you haven't yet seen Justified, do yourself a favor and catch it when it re-airs on FX. Watch it On Demand.

1331621,A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,B0038M2APA,Shopper,"[204, 229]","Well, it is set in Eastern Kentucky, rather then in Sparta, Mississippi; still, Justified is bound to resonate with any fan of the groundbreaking In the Heat of the Night series: small-town-in-a-big-World problems being solved creatively in 60 minutes or less, but without the annoyingly preachy tone that In the Heat of the Night would sometimes assume. A definite positive! You'll have fun making character comparisons between the two shows (can you find a ""Bubba""? how about a ""Luanne""?).Let me first note that Justified is a very new show; so far, only six episodes have been aired. However, the episodes carry such an unusually high degree of promise, I feel confident rating the series, even at this early stage, with the top score.The story is simple: deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) brings too much negative attention to himself by killing one Miami thug too many... He is therefore relegated to a remote post to cool his heels. Unfortunately for Raylan, the post happens to be the sleepy Eastern Kentucky, where he grew up and hoped never to come back... Estranged petty criminal father, an ex-wife, an ex-flame, an ex-friend... Well... they do say you can never go back home... Or, was it: you SHOULD NEVER go back home?... Anyway, upon this background, the writers skillfully project a series of surprisingly engaging, multidimensional stories that go beyond catching ""the baddy of the week."" Yes, there is the usual parade of rednecks (and I hope we'll get to see more eccentric types as time progresses), but often ""the baddies"" are portrayed as flawed human beings, making some very poor choices, all while doing their best to survive in this World. And that does have the effect of bringing them into conflict with the law.Also satisfying is the way the writers choose to characterize Raylan: he is NOT some cartoon super hero using secret kung fu moves to dispatch his enemies. Instead, he is a humble man, still dealing with emotional ramifications of his divorce, and still conflicted in his relationship with his father. Occasionally, he allows his foes to gain the upper hand (and rob him of his car, badge, and gun), further proving he is a real person, which makes him very relatable... Kudos to Timothy Olyphant for his portrayal of Givens. Both he and the writers have the character spot on from the first minute of the pilot!To those who like action though, worry NOT. The stories never get sappy and there is plenty of creative a** kicking (somehow, even a bazooka makes it into the script!). If I were forced to find a pet peeve regarding Justified, it would probably be the unrealistically high number of good looking people with porcelain veneers and slim waistlines the authors have inhabiting the area. From my personal experience involving a five week stay in Lexington, Kentucky, the reality has fewer teeth and a much higher BMI (no offence to the locals intended ;o) ).And so, keep this show on your radar. I don't watch TV anymore (I have cancelled my cable as it seems to stream nothing more then vile reality shows), but am so enthused by Justified, that I actually pay to watch it on Amazon On Demand...

1331645,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B0038M2APA,Stephen M. Lerch,"[24, 28]","Justified is an FX station (Super Channel for our Canadian brethren) series that began airing March 6, 2010 so it is relatively new.Raylan Givens is a US Marshal who, after a performing a justified (perp pulled weapon first) shooting in Miami in the line of duty, is relegated to Harlan Kentucky. Turns out Harlan is Raylan's hometown. Seems Raylan is seen as a bit of a loose canon and in an attempt to control him and also lessen his impact on the reputation of the US Marshal services they send him somewhere they think he can't cause much of a stir. For the sake of good TV they were wrong, of course.Every episode is nicely wrapped up in the allotted 45ish minutes, with some story bits (such as Raylan's father, his old sweet heart and so on) over arcing. Those over arcing bits are really just background history and so on, which makes it easier for people to jump in at the middle of a season.The Raylan character is based on a short story by Elmore Leonard (3:10 to Yuma was another of his stories). You can find it in the bookWhen the Women Come Out to Dance: Storiesand it is also available for free from Harper Collins' website (if you hit Elmore Leonard's website, you should be able to find the link to it; Amazon doesn't allow links to external sites in reviews, which is why I didn't include it).My focus is mainly from the Blu Ray's technical specs and execution. I like the show, which is why I bought the Blu Ray.Video:Justified was shot using HD cameras, so it almost goes without saying that it looks darn good. Originally I believe it aired in 720p but is presented here in, I believe, non-upscaled 1080p, which means they ""downscale"" it for TV. The images are bright, crisp and clear with many a fine detail available in pretty much every shot. No grain, no dust or dirt.It is encoded using AVC and has no compression issues. Even with 5 episodes on disc 1, there is no evidence of compression problems in the slightest. It looks great.Audio:Audio is encoded with DTS-HD 5.1 MA. There are absolutely no audio issues detectable.One thing I notice, however, is that despite this being a 5.1 mix, there really don't seem to be too many detectable surround effects. Occasionally you'll hear ambiance effects back there, but not much more. If you're looking for a show to give your surround system a real work out, look somewhere else. I assume this has to do more with being made for TV than it does with it being a problem with the masters they used for the series.It sounds great, but it sounds like it is mainly stereo.Packaging:Justified comes in an oversized Blu Ray case that has a hinged disc holder in the center. It works well and does a good job of keeping the discs on the hubs. Even though Amazon shipped my copy in a simple bubble mailer, none of the discs came off the hubs in transit.The front cover is pretty much all the artwork you have. The back cover has the required series description and specs. Inside you have a small flyer for Justified Season 2 and on the back another series (Rescue Me I believe) that also airs on FX.Packaging is acceptable but not exceptional.Extras:You have commentary on several episodes (Fire in the Hole, Blowback and Hatless). These commentaries are spread across the discs as the episodes in question don't necessarily fall next to one another in numerical order.Featurettes:What Would Elmore Do? - Emore Leonard discusses the series and the crew discuss why they like Elmore.The Story of Justified - Interviews with the cast focused on the show, not characters. I believe this was available as a behind the scenes video clip on FX's Justified websiteJustified: Meet the Characters - Interviews with cast in regards to characters, not necessarily focused on the show content. Again, I believe this was available on FX's websiteShooting for Kentucky - Justified is mainly shot in California; how do you make CA look like KY?Meet the Marshals - discusses the history of US Marshals, both in real life and Hollywood's perspectiveLong Hard Times to Come Music Video - music video of the opening theme (performed by Gangstagrass)Season Two a Look Ahead - Details at a high level what to expect from Season 2.The extras are all spread across the three discs in the set. And while none are necessarily knock out of the park, drop your jaw to the floor, it really is nice to have all the extra information on the show and to learn where the directors/writers/cast are coming from when depicting the stories on screen. Good stuff all over.Final Thoughts:Justified, the series itself, isn't entirely unique (see another reviewer's comparison to ""In the Heat of the Night"") but the stories are compelling, interesting and engrossing. The characters have charm and are interesting, though all of them are really overshadowed by the enigma that is Raylan. It's a great show and my current favorite TV series.The Blu Ray is a high quality offering and something any fan of the show that has access to a Blu Ray player should want to have access to. If you haven't seen the show (either you missed it or don't get FX), you may want to pay $2 for the first episode on Amazon's VOD service. If you like what you see, spend the $22 (current price of the Blu Ray of the series) and enjoy. The first episode really sets the mood of the show and if you enjoy it, you will almost certainly enjoy the remainder.Highly recommended from a content (the show is good) perspective and also from a Blu Ray (extras, video/audio quality) perspective.",5,Blu-Ray review,1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,5490,"['Justified', 'FX', 'station', 'Super', 'Channel', 'Canadian', 'brethren', 'series', 'began',

The Last Episode tied all the eposodes together. We can't be certain if Marshal Raylan Givens won't be transferred to a new location. We know that much of the cast will be changed.I am not worried, I will be back to watch the next season and I will hope that the craftsmenship that the Director, Writers and Actors  displayed in the first season has been included in the second season. I can't recall ever seeing a group of actors work better on screen to tell an incredibly entertaining story.A recent show addressed the concept that just because a person can fire an automatic weapon is not necessarily synonymous with intellegence. Screen Writer Ryan Bradley mentioned that most killers aren't really as smart as 007. Yet characters (Bad Guys)in this series seems to have some depth. Arlin for one. Boyd for another. As for the Ladies, I don't know why Raylan gets to be so lucky.Post Note: The two strongest episodes were the first and the last. Part of the direction of this series had been predicated upon the availability of the actors. Boyd Crowder was shot chest center with a 45 caliber slug at the end of the first show. He survived it. (This happens in a soap opera when actor contracts or schedules forces the writers to kill the actor but then for reasons not known to the rest of us to seemingly bring him or her back as a miricle). In Blind Spot the Sheriff places two rounds in a cntract killers chest. After a brief period of time (two minites) the contract killer somehow picks up a gun and swings his arm around slowly to shoot the Sheriff. Could be, we have about 6 minites after the blood stops pumping.In ""Bullitville"", Boyd Crowder suffers another gun shot from a hunting rifle in the chest on the left side just above the heart. The shock and trauma of this round should have put him in shock if not out and out kill him. This last event made me wonder if Mr. Croggins would be returning to Justified for a second season.

I can't understand why it would go into a second or third season... unless a whole bunch of rednecks made it. Oh, I guess it's on FOX, so that makes sense. The pilot episode was awesome, but every episode since then has been pretty stupid - not as much gunplay as you'd hope for and a lot of old cliche romance BS that always ruins a good man show. It's entertaining enough that I don't fall asleep in my recliner, but I wish I would have spent the $20 on something a tad more exciting.I also think this show has a political agenda, and since it's on FOX, that shouldn't surprise anyone. Here's the picture it paints: It's cool to be a redneck. The Confederate flag is cool. It's cool to drink alcohol all the time. It's cool to talk like you're from Dixie. And, it's cool to treat women like objects. I don't know about you, but I'm hoping a whole lot of people don't start talking like rednecks and wearing cowboy hats because of this show.Sure, the show has its one token black female deputy marshal, so its creators can say they're not racist, but who do they think they're fooling?And, one last thing: You would think that a major network like FOX could afford to shoot a TV action/drama in real settings, right? Then, why is almost every interior car scene obviously done using CGI and a green screen?

There's anything but your typical TV storylines so if you can't afford cable then buy the series, save yourself a bundle, and sit back and enjoy.If you want to find some interesting reading (when you're done watching the first season) then check out Leonard's old westerns that shaped or set the tone for much of what we've grown up with in good westerns. He wrote Hombe, 3:10 to Yuma, The Tonto Woman, Valdez is Coming, and so many other good westerns AND that was before he started writing his action books and thrillers, that guess what? became a handful (make that two handfuls) of top selling movies.Yeah, I'm a fan of Elmore Leonard's and if you're watching JUSTIFIED then chances are, you are too.Finally, there's this: watch the first season and come back and post your own review because your opinion matters too, especially when it comes to shelling out dollars for a product.Enjoy it, my friends!",5,TV for Grown-ups,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,1481,"['Wow', 'television', 'program', 'adults', 'then', 'talented', 'mind', 'Elmore', ""'Dutch"", 'Leonard', 'maybe', 'why', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'lines', 'action', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'small', 'screen', 'today', 'Marshal', 'Raylan', 'Givens', 'kind', 'Marshal', 'one', 'even', 'bad', 'guys', 'can', 'respect', 'word', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'keeping', 'best', 'company.He', 'back', 'home', 'working', 'Kentucky', 'past', 'be', 'filled', 'more', 'little', 'interesting', 'peoples', 'twists', 'Season', 'One', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'Season', 'Two', 'good', 'anything', 'typical', 'TV', 'storylines', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'cable', 'then', 'buy', 'series', 'save', 'bundle', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy.If', 'want', 'find', 'interesting', 'reading', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'Leonard', 'old', 'westerns', 'shaped', 'set', 'tone', 'much', 'what', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'good', 'westerns', 'wrote', 'Hombe', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'Tonto', 'Woman', 'Valdez', 'Coming', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'good', 'westerns', 'was', 'started', 'writing', 'action', 'books', 'thrillers', 'guess', 'what', 'became', 'handful', 'make', 'two', 'handfuls', 'top', 'selling', 'movies.Yeah', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', ""'re"", 'watching', 'JUSTIFIED', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'are', 'too.Finally', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'come', 'back', 'post', 'own', 'review', 'opinion', 'matters', 'too', 'especially', 'when', 'shelling', 'out', 'dollars', 'product.Enjoy', 'friends']",Justified: Season 1
