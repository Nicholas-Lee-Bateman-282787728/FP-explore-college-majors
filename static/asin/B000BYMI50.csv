953094,A37CC2I37GI7Z2,B000BYMI50,A Reviewer,"[3, 3]","This third season of ""Touched By An Angel"" is very good. They don't make shows like this anymore. And so far, there aren't anymore reruns of this show. Therefore, I recommend that all fans of this show should buy this set, along with Seasons 1 and 2. The only downfall about this set is that it's released in two volumes. But it's not a big issue because this set is much cheaper than the first two season. Now, as far as the picture quality is, it's ok. It's not the best transfer. The main problem with the picture is that it has a muddy look and there is some bleeding. Overall, it's not a bad transfer, but it could've been better. As far as the sound quality is, it is very good. In my opinion, this is the best a Dolby Digital 2.0 sound can get. The theme song has great bass and dialogue is always very clear. This set is worth owning because of it's great content. Now get yours now before they go out of print.",5,Great DVD.

953096,A1LDMDMUBJSUN4,B000BYMI50,Bruce E. Munck,"[16, 18]","Complete season sets of Andy Griffith contain 32 episodes, each fitting into a half-hour time slot. They sell for roughly $30. TBAA season 3, set 1 contains 16 episodes, each for a one-hour time slot. It also sells for roughly $30. I don't see any disparity there and will not be complaining to anyone. I am most happy to have this program available to buy and am glad that it is being marketed at a very competitive price. I, like many others, would be willing to pay more if it were necessary, simply because this is such a great series. True fans will buy all of the seasons...if they are released...any way they are released...for any reasonable price. The digital conversion that was done on the first two seasons was excellent. Picture quality is great, and if you've never heard the opening theme song through a good surround-sound system with LOTS of bass you're in for a real treat! What a theme song ... and what a voice! Della...""you done good""!!! Well, this is one satisfied customer: with the first two seasons in-hand and the first part of season 3 on the way I am supremely happy that the series is still alive and available to those of us who love it.

953117,A6SWAK6XUFHV0,B000BYMI50,Wonderous Thoughts,"[14, 18]","I understand the frustration about the split-packaging of this DVD series. In fact, I support the criticism to the studio for this type of marketing. First off, there's only one reason at which they have chosen this style of ""money making"" and that I'm sure is not one that makes anyone happy but themselves. Second, this is by far one of the most popular and respected shows to have aired in television history and this marketing only brings a tainted dipiction of the series to some of the most beloved fans.Not everyone loves this show, no. But, not everyone who does can afford this split-packaging idea either. There's no need for it and they're going to get more money for it anyway. It's also odd in the fact that the show designates the need to love and understand one another while the studio releasing of this series is doing just the opposite. I can't help but be reminded of Jesus turning over the tables of the robbers when they were making a profit off of religous sacraments that were unneccessary and offensive to some people. Some may argue that this is the same, some may say it's not as bad as the original situation. I shall let the consumer decide for themselves.Nevertheless, I still love the show, but I may end up passing on buying more of the seasons until the studio realizes their mistake and how they are frustrating many consumers who love this beloved show. This is the same studio that made the mistake in 2002 and 2003 to release the first season of I Love Lucy in 9 volumes spanning over a year long release. I'm sure eventually they will once again realize this mistake and re-release season three of Angel, like they did of the first I Love Lucy season in 2005, when they come back to reality.(My 1 star rating applies to the packaging, not the series nor the season themselves.)",1,Love the show...hate the packaging,1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,1814,"['understand', 'frustration', 'split-packaging', 'DVD', 'series', 'fact', 'support', 'criticism', 'studio', 'type', 'marketing', 'First', 'off', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'have', 'chosen', 'style', 'money', 'making', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'one', 'anyone', 'happy', 'Second', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'respected', 'shows', 'have', 'aired', 'television', 'history', 'marketing', 'only', 'tainted', 'dipiction', 'series', 'most', 'beloved', 'fans.Not', 'everyone', 'show', 'not', 'everyone', 'who', 'can', 'afford', 'split-packaging', 'idea', 'either', 'need', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'anyway', 'also', 'odd', 'fact', 'show', 'need', 'love', 'understand', 'one', 'studio', 'releasing', 'series', 'doing', 'just', 'opposite', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'reminded', 'Jesus', 'turning', 'over', 'tables', 'robbers', 'when', 'were', 'making', 'profit', 'religous', 'sacraments', 'were', 'unneccessary', 'offensive', 'people', 'may', 'argue', 'same', 'may', 'say', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'original', 'situation', 'shall', 'let', 'consumer', 'decide', 'themselves.Nevertheless', 'still', 'love', 'show', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'passing', 'buying', 'more', 'seasons', 'studio', 'mistake', 'how', 'are', 'frustrating', 'many', 'consumers', 'who', 'love', 'beloved', 'show', 'same', 'studio', 'made', 'mistake', '2002', '2003', 'release', 'first', 'season', 'Love', 'Lucy', '9', 'volumes', 'spanning', 'year', 'long', 'release', ""'m"", 'sure', 'eventually', 'will', 'once', 'again', 'realize', 'mistake', 're-release', 'season', 'three', 'Angel', 'did', 'first', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'season', '2005', 'when', 'come', 'back', 'reality', '1', 'star', 'rating', 'applies', 'packaging', 'not', 'series', 'season']",N/A
