It is an incredible story filled heartache, pain, jealousy, and most of all, a forbidden love between a priest and a young lady.  Anyone who has ever had a crush on their parish priest can relate to the attraction but to take it one step further certainly brings out the critics.  Let us all remember that Catholic priests ARE still children of God, ARE still human and have human emotions.  This is a beautiful story and Meggie's love for Ralph is undeniable.  Would YOU spend your lifetime trying to obtain someone's love (must less a priest as herein) so desperately?  Everyone will have their own thoughts, but in my own personal opinion, this kind of love is that which we all would want to feel - aside from not being able to have it forever.
