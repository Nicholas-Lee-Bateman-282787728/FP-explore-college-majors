After ""Queer as folk"", Sharon had a wonderful role as Michael's mother who wore her pride on her sleeve and vest. This role was just the opposite: an older woman in a nursing home waiting to see her dear friend/partner in another ward.I could see the frustration in her rights even though GLBT aren't granted the same as traditional couples who are covered by the federal govt and all the benefits including tax write-offs, hospital visits etc...I was connected by the sense of desperation to see the other before its too late. The human connection and her acting made it all the while a good performance.

What happens to aging lesbian couples? How their families approach the issue? In most cases they refuse to validate and legitimize their relationship. I've only seen the subject tackled in a short story of If These Walls Could Talk 2, but it's not something you see very often.The story here is carried masterfully, the acting is great, and the outcome of these family relationships is really encouraging. To see how this young woman comes back in search of her family history, and weaves a beautiful relationship with her great grandmother 's life partner is really touching. Getting to see what this lesbian's couple life was like is a real treat, and it leaves a good taste in your mouth.

A tale of two women that love each other.  One gets married and has kids to get the acceptability a normal life gives and one never does.  But they love each other through this and children of the one that takes a husband.  He dies very early and leaves no gap that needed to be filled because it was already over flowing.The story is how at the end of life rest home hospitals can become our home because of old age challenges.  Nurses and blood family can rule a persons life and keep them away from their loved ones altogether.  But love will always win out and this is one story of how it does.I repeat a must see movie with many tears for watchers but beautiful.  Id not be surprised if this movie didnt change a life of many.,5,From the Heart...,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,846,"['top', 'line', 'movie', 'anyway', 'should', 'watch', 'Queer', 'lovers', 'haters', 'will', 'confirm', 'lovers', 'convert', 'haters', 'tale', 'two', 'women', 'love', 'other', 'One', 'married', 'kids', 'get', 'acceptability', 'normal', 'life', 'one', 'never', 'love', 'other', 'children', 'one', 'husband', 'very', 'early', 'gap', 'needed', 'be', 'filled', 'was', 'already', 'flowing.The', 'story', 'how', 'end', 'life', 'rest', 'home', 'hospitals', 'can', 'become', 'home', 'old', 'age', 'Nurses', 'blood', 'family', 'can', 'rule', 'persons', 'life', 'keep', 'away', 'loved', 'ones', 'altogether', 'love', 'will', 'always', 'win', 'out', 'one', 'story', 'how', 'repeat', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'many', 'tears', 'watchers', 'beautiful', 'Id', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'movie', 'change', 'life', 'many']",N/A

When Rachel marries to conform to family and social expectations, the free spirited Hannah leaves, starting on a series of adventures to far-flung destinations. Rachel however, remainedthe love of her life. After Rachel's husband dies, Hannah returns and they pick up where they had left off as lovers.Hannah (Sharon Gless), now cantankerous nursing home resident, chronicles their life together while her lover Rachel (Maureen Gallagher) lies in a coma in the same nursing home. Frequent flashbacks weave between the past and present illustrating the strength of their love affair despite Rachel's marriage, Hannah's affairs, a war and family objections. Rachel's daughter Marge, who is jealous of the bond that Hannah and her mother share, forbids Hannah from seeing Rachel. When feisty 20-year-old Greta (Jacqui Jackson), Rachel's great-granddaughter arrives at the nursing home in search of stories from the depression era, she meets Hannah. Outraged that Hannah is unable to see Rachel, Greta plots to reunite the lovers.Director Wendy Jo Carlton has created a moving portrait of a life lived and the devastation that occurs when a partner's life hangs in the balance. Screenwriter Claudia Allen is well known for her portrayals of strong female characters; she adapted Hannah Free from her own play.Sharon Glass is brilliant as Hannah, an aging lesbian frustrated by the lack of rights and respect given to her in the nursing home she is forced to inhabit. She is as endearing in Hannah Free as she has been in TV dramas Queer as Folk and of course, Cagney and Lacey.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide",5,Wonderful!,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1716,"['Hannah', 'Rachel', 'meet', 'children', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'small', 'mid-western', 'town', 'When', 'Rachel', 'conform', 'family', 'social', 'expectations', 'free', 'spirited', 'Hannah', 'starting', 'series', 'adventures', 'far-flung', 'destinations', 'Rachel', 'however', 'remainedthe', 'love', 'life', 'Rachel', 'husband', 'Hannah', 'returns', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'had', 'left', 'off', 'lovers.Hannah', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'now', 'cantankerous', 'nursing', 'home', 'resident', 'life', 'together', 'lover', 'Rachel', 'Maureen', 'Gallagher', 'coma', 'same', 'nursing', 'home', 'Frequent', 'flashbacks', 'weave', 'past', 'present', 'illustrating', 'strength', 'love', 'affair', 'Rachel', 'marriage', 'Hannah', 'affairs', 'war', 'family', 'objections', 'Rachel', 'daughter', 'Marge', 'who', 'jealous', 'bond', 'Hannah', 'mother', 'share', 'forbids', 'Hannah', 'seeing', 'Rachel', 'When', 'feisty', '20-year-old', 'Greta', 'Jacqui', 'Jackson', 'Rachel', 'great-granddaughter', 'arrives', 'nursing', 'home', 'search', 'stories', 'depression', 'era', 'Hannah', 'Outraged', 'Hannah', 'unable', 'see', 'Rachel', 'Greta', 'plots', 'reunite', 'lovers.Director', 'Wendy', 'Jo', 'Carlton', 'created', 'moving', 'portrait', 'life', 'lived', 'devastation', 'when', 'partner', 'life', 'hangs', 'balance', 'Screenwriter', 'Claudia', 'Allen', 'well', 'known', 'portrayals', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'adapted', 'Hannah', 'Free', 'own', 'play.Sharon', 'Glass', 'brilliant', 'Hannah', 'aging', 'lesbian', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'rights', 'respect', 'given', 'nursing', 'home', 'forced', 'inhabit', 'endearing', 'Hannah', 'Free', 'been', 'TV', 'dramas', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'course', 'Cagney', 'Lacey.Chris', 'AldersonAuthor', '2013', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Guide']",N/A

Someone dare compare this mess to Broke Back Mountain and there is no way this dribble has anything close to the essence of that beautiful movie. Sharon put her money into this project so it is no wonder she has a small part. The characters were not likeable nor was there any real character development. I bought this DVD and suffered through it until the end hoping it would improve along the way. IT DID NOT! How pathetic this movie is.

1337619,A2FRAS05LEI6JJ,B003E1QC1S,Sadie,"[0, 0]","This is a sweet, sentimental tale about two women who've loved each other their entire lives.Hannah ends up in a nursing home after a fall, during which time her life-love, Rachel, has a stroke, falls into a coma and is kept in one of the other rooms of the same nursing home.  Although Hannah helped Rachel raise her twins, Marge and Roy, Marge refuses to allow Hannah to see Rachel on her death bed because Hannah isn't a family member.  Unable to get herself out of bed, Hannah is at the mercy of the staff, who won't go against the wishes of Rachel's family.  A young woman approaches Hannah for help on a report about the Depression then conspires to help Hannah see the love of her life during her final hours.There's probably no better person to play a bed ridden character than Sharon Gless.  Her facial expressions alone say more than most dialogue.  The story is told both in present and past, with younger actresses playing the couple.  Kelli Strickland as a young Hannah captures her yearning to be free while wanting young Rachel, played by Ann Hageman, to keep the home fires burning. All actresses give this heartwarming story the warmth it deserves.Anyone who is thinking of refusing access to a relative's loved-one during their final hours should watch this movie.

1337620,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B003E1QC1S,susannah,"[4, 4]","This was indeed a good film, and portrayed well all its characters, whether they were likable or not. Sharon Gless has always been one of my favorite actresses and she did well in this film but boy Hannah was a lousy partner. I think the film could have explored more not just Hannah's need to roam but her selfishness, why what she wanted, whether it was travel or another lover, came before everyone else's needs, always. It shouldn't have taken to elder age for her partner to put her foot down. Hannah seemed to be blind to the fact that there were children involved, who also loved and needed her, and felt abandoned by her. I could understand where the daughter's bitterness came from, and in a sense Hannah should have respected it, but she wanted it both ways.I was glad though that Hannah was able to get to the daughter's motivation for the choices she was making, and promote healing for both of them.The film just glossed over these points but Gless and the other actors did a great job showing the love and pain and loneliness and anger. It is also important to depict the rights of lesbians/gays to have those they love around them and to make decisions for them.
