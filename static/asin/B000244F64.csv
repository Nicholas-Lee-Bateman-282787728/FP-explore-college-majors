(And I had read that it was 'the closest' version to the book.) So, I ordered it. But, alas, it was an untimely purchase because the newest ""Emma"" happened to appear on television. When I proudly presented 'my' gift version of ""Emma"" to My Beloved, she could not reconcile a ""plain Emma"" with the more attractive and vivacious newer model of the latest TV offering. (For my sake she toiled through it and then went out and bought the latest TV version.)Sometimes life is cruel. Perhaps the real Emma was as plain-faced as the one I purchased, but I could never convince my wife of that.That is why I have scored this ""Emma"" as 3 stars [""It's OK""].

I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma.

While I doubt any filmmaker has ever set out with the intention of creating a bad film, many who took on the task of adapting Jane Austen's most daring novel accomplished just that. There are several factors which make this 1972 version work so well. Firstly, in this lengthy run-time the tale is given ample space to unfold. Secondly, the story itself takes center billing here instead of a famous cast out to use Austen's novel as  a vehicle to add some shade of ""heft"" to their careers. (No names, but we can probably all zero-in on some egregious examples.) Emma Woodhouse has never been quite so flawed, so off-putting, so likable and so many-faceted as she is here. The production is charmingly dated, special effects are virtually nowhere to be found amid the lovely old stage sets, and the dialogue is so crisp it is a sheer pleasure to listen to what's said here.

823933,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000244F64,D. S. Thurlow,"[2, 2]","Jane Austen's classic romantic comedy ""Emma"" comes to life in this 4 1/2 hour BBC TV production from 1972.  High quality TV production values and perfect settings frame a strong presentation with many excellent performances.The handsome, clever, and rich Emma Woodhouse, 21 years-old and spoiled by a doddering father, sets out to play matchmaker in her home village of Highbury.  She chooses as her subject Harriet Smith, a young woman of uncertain parentage.  Emma will first curtail Harriet's promising relationship with a young farmer, in favor of matching her with the village vicar, Mr. Elton.  That effort goes disasterously astray on a holiday evening.The arrival of the handsome and charming Mr. Frank Churchill in Highbury will shake up Emma's plans.  The newcomer will promptly set the village buzzing with romantic rumors, and even Emma herself will be captivated.  Only Emma's friendly mentor Mr. Knightley will be a voice of reason, as Emma's schemes lead to a series of misunderstandings that will cause her to finally question her own judgment.This version of ""Emma"" is generally solidly cast, especially the actors playing Mrs. Elton and Harriet Smith.  Doran Godwin is a good Emma, although she appears a bit too old and rather prim for the role.  John Carson similarly appears too old for his otherwise excellent turn as Mr. Knightley.  This reviewer regrets the crucial Box Hill scene was mishandled through changes from its original form.  Otherwise, the BBC production of ""Emma"" is highly recommended to Jane Austen fans.",4,Emma Conquers Highbury...,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,1543,"['Jane', 'Austen', 'classic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Emma', 'life', '4', '1/2', 'hour', 'BBC', 'TV', 'production', '1972', 'High', 'quality', 'TV', 'production', 'values', 'perfect', 'settings', 'frame', 'strong', 'presentation', 'many', 'excellent', 'performances.The', 'handsome', 'clever', 'rich', 'Emma', 'Woodhouse', '21', 'years-old', 'spoiled', 'doddering', 'father', 'out', 'play', 'matchmaker', 'home', 'village', 'Highbury', 'subject', 'Harriet', 'Smith', 'young', 'woman', 'uncertain', 'parentage', 'Emma', 'will', 'first', 'curtail', 'Harriet', 'promising', 'relationship', 'young', 'farmer', 'favor', 'matching', 'village', 'vicar', 'Mr.', 'Elton', 'effort', 'disasterously', 'astray', 'holiday', 'evening.The', 'arrival', 'handsome', 'charming', 'Mr.', 'Frank', 'Churchill', 'Highbury', 'will', 'shake', 'up', 'Emma', 'plans', 'newcomer', 'will', 'promptly', 'set', 'village', 'buzzing', 'romantic', 'rumors', 'even', 'Emma', 'will', 'be', 'captivated', 'Only', 'Emma', 'friendly', 'mentor', 'Mr.', 'Knightley', 'will', 'be', 'voice', 'reason', 'Emma', 'schemes', 'lead', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'will', 'cause', 'finally', 'question', 'own', 'judgment.This', 'version', 'Emma', 'generally', 'solidly', 'cast', 'especially', 'actors', 'playing', 'Mrs.', 'Elton', 'Harriet', 'Smith', 'Doran', 'Godwin', 'good', 'Emma', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'rather', 'prim', 'role', 'John', 'Carson', 'similarly', 'too', 'old', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'turn', 'Mr.', 'Knightley', 'reviewer', 'crucial', 'Box', 'Hill', 'scene', 'was', 'mishandled', 'changes', 'original', 'form', 'Otherwise', 'BBC', 'production', 'Emma', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fans']",N/A
823934,A1B86SJOKGAZ3B,B000244F64,"E. Sadowski ""marine sis""","[0, 0]","I have just recently watched this 1972 &#34;Emma&#34; again and have decided to add my own comments. Before proceeding, let's be clear on this early BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's wonderful book. &#34;Emma&#34; is the most faithful version there is. As someone else posted, this isn't an over sexed or over feminized modern film for those who need that kind of kick. This is a mini series that represents a truer picture of how people lived, behaved, walked, talked, comported themselves, and thought in a  tightknit community during the nineteenth century in a particular country environment. One gets to see the rich interacting with the middle class and the poor. Therefore, since the whole book is virtually TAPED for the INDOOR scenes and FILMED for the OUTDOOR scenes the mini series takes its time to unfold which will cause some people to be bored by it since the pace is too slow for some. If one's attention span is limited or one needs faster action then this definitely is not the version for one.Secondly, this &#34;Emma&#34; is NOT a movie, rather, it is like a stage play with the roles performed by mostly theater trained actors. The way of emoting on the stage is clearly different from movie acting. If one has no appreciation for theater then, again, &#34;Emma&#34; will certainly disappoint one. However, if one is willing to have an open mind and give it a chance perhaps surprises are bound to strike one when least expected. The British public traditionally and historically has had a stronger affinity for theater than its American counterparts but, then again, to each his own although it is good to experience a different format when watching classics.Thirdly, since early BBC was on a tight budget back in its day, there is no high tech gadgetry or tricks in this production. Perhaps many of us are spoiled by the gilt and glitter of Hollywood's superior technological advances that some look down on excellent works not up to par or unwilling to accept fine gems simply because they may appear dull looking or simple. Well, all glitter is not gold. There are many movies out there that are visually stunning but whose storylines suck, are confusing, or lacking altogether. &#34;Emma&#34; has strong character developments so one knows who and what a certain character is and thinks. One does not confuse Emma Woodhouse with a Mrs. Elton or Mr. Knightly with Mr. Elton. If one is like me who dotes on good character development then all the furnishings, although sparse, do not distract from the overall storyline. This brings me to another point about the cast.Yes, the cast itself. Some people grumble that Doran Godwin isn't pretty enough or looks too old to play Emma Woodhouse while others say that John Carson is too old  or too pudgy to play Mr. Knightly. To that I say, again, perhaps Hollywood's focus on beauty, youth, and slimness somehow affects our perception of what also constitutes good actors. As always, the mega talented but not especially glamorous looking people holds some back from becoming true stars due to their &#34;ugly duckling&#34; status. Of course, fans of Jane Austen's books, especially, &#34;Emma&#34; have their own visualizations of how each character should look. Yet, when I think of it, what were the standards of beauty in nineteenth century England? Of course, women were considered better looking when not freckled but whatever the standards for men were one cannot possibly know. Certainly, the British themselves were never snobs about giving a particular role to very talented individuals regardless of their beauty, waistline, or age. Yet, I believe, 1972's &#34;Emma&#34; had a very excellent cast and it is enjoyable to watch them act. This requires an open mind.Last but not least, as mentioned before, although this mini series is faithful to the book a few liberties were taken. Bear in mind the difference between a book versus the film media. As one knows, a book needs to add details to let a reader know what the author has in mind when writing.A writer can be as wordy as she chooses but when adapting a book to a film sometimes insignificant scenes that do not allow for a smooth flow have to be eliminated. That is the cost of filming. However, as far as this &#34;Emma&#34; goes there is a particular scene that is puzzling. SPOILER ALERT! When Frank Churchill and Emma discuss as to the individual who might be the secret admirer of Jane Fairfax who was given a piano, there is a mention of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon as though they were an elderly couple. In the book, Mr. Dixon is engaged to Jane's best friend, Miss Campbell, and not yet married. Strange! Yet, if one has never read the book I suppose it makes no difference.In conclusion, if one is determined to purchase or rent &#34;Emma&#34; please keep an open mind. Perhaps it takes a while to get used to early BBC as it did me at first but in time you might learn to appreciate this and other classics that are true to the book.",5,Beautiful Austen

Yes, it's got the usual sub-par production values and theater-like acting custom from the period dramas of the time, but I've thoroughly enjoyed  other adaptations made in the same way. Despite its length, it made a few changes to the story (such as making the Dixons a couple who wanted to hire Jane...?) that puzzled me. And it felt slightly boring and draggy at times as well. But I think the main reason I couldn't connect with it was the actors. Or really, one main actress- Emma herself.She was my main problem with the series. I just couldn't connect with her at all. She came off as much older and more mature than the Emma of the book. I was shocked to read she was only 22 at the time, because I would have guessed her to be at least 30. I think it was the way she spoke- a very clipped, fakey aristocratic accent. At least I hope it was faked and that she didn't really talk like that in real life! I never saw any real emotion from her- it was all so artificial.This is really one adaptation that I found so boring a lot of the time that I couldn't even find enough to say about it.

823940,A2HKRNELD7DGX1,B000244F64,Lili_K,"[13, 20]","This BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's delightful novel of the same title, was a correct and faithful adaptation as far as plot is concerned and quite leisurely, it has six episodes, but all in all it was not quite the thing.This is mainly due to the actress, playing the main charcter Emma, herself: Doran Godwin. She is not a bad actress but she just couldn't catch Emma's vivacity, energy and liveliness and warm heart - she was too sedate, pretending to be too superior and sometimes she was cold  and .... a tad old to play a 21-year-old young girl. No matter how much I tried I couldn't like her and could not get involved in what would happen to her in the course of the series. Things changed slightly for the better in the latter episodes, she turned into a more positive character, but only because the excellent Fiona Walker as Mrs Elton appeared on scene. She was absolutely brilliant as the vulgar, upstart wife of the vicar Mr Elton, she provoked an instant dislike in the audience with her pretentious ""airs and graces"". It was only opposed to her that Emma seems a more positive character. With her own means, D. Godwin couldn't make it, which is a great pity, for despite her numerous faults Emma IS a very likeable character in the book, just as JA herself intended her to be (and we can see this both in the Beckinsale and Paltrow version).There were other actors that did not fit the part they were made to play. Ellen Dryden, as Mrs Weston and John Carson as Mr Knightely were way too old for their part and Robert East as Frank Churchill was slimy and his I-have-so-many-teeth smile made me cringe whenever I saw it and it happened quite often.On the other hand, Donald Eccles as Mr Woodhouse was great, just like Timothy Peters in the role of Mr Elton. Debbie Bowen was a perfect Harriet Smith: pretty, empty-headed but with honest feelings and clearly in great awe of Emma's superiority.I also liked Ania Marson as Jane Fairfax, however I couldn't understand for the life of me why they had to change her story (Mr Dixon - whom Emma imagines to be in love with Jane - instead of being Ms Campbell's (Jane's close friend) fianc&eacute;, is a family man who offers Jane a place as governess which she refuses).The other most important element I missed was the chemistry between Emma and Mr Knightley - which could have given some spice to the film, but as it was non-existent ...As I said before, it is a correct adaptation with some high points, but there are more things you find wanting.",3,"a correct adaptation, but nothing more",1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,2510,"['BBC', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'delightful', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'was', 'correct', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'concerned', 'quite', 'leisurely', 'six', 'episodes', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'thing.This', 'mainly', 'due', 'actress', 'playing', 'main', 'charcter', 'Emma', 'Doran', 'Godwin', 'not', 'bad', 'actress', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'catch', 'Emma', 'vivacity', 'energy', 'liveliness', 'warm', 'heart', 'was', 'too', 'sedate', 'pretending', 'be', 'too', 'superior', 'sometimes', 'was', 'cold', 'tad', 'old', 'play', '21-year-old', 'young', 'girl', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'tried', 'could', ""n't"", 'like', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'course', 'series', 'Things', 'changed', 'slightly', 'better', 'latter', 'episodes', 'turned', 'more', 'positive', 'character', 'only', 'excellent', 'Fiona', 'Walker', 'Mrs', 'Elton', 'appeared', 'scene', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'vulgar', 'upstart', 'wife', 'vicar', 'Mr', 'Elton', 'provoked', 'instant', 'dislike', 'audience', 'pretentious', 'airs', 'graces', 'was', 'only', 'opposed', 'Emma', 'more', 'positive', 'character', 'own', 'means', 'D.', 'Godwin', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'great', 'pity', 'numerous', 'faults', 'Emma', 'very', 'likeable', 'character', 'book', 'just', 'JA', 'intended', 'be', 'can', 'see', 'Beckinsale', 'Paltrow', 'version', 'were', 'other', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'part', 'were', 'made', 'play', 'Ellen', 'Dryden', 'Mrs', 'Weston', 'John', 'Carson', 'Mr', 'Knightely', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'Robert', 'East', 'Frank', 'Churchill', 'was', 'slimy', 'I-have-so-many-teeth', 'smile', 'made', 'cringe', 'whenever', 'saw', 'happened', 'quite', 'often.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Donald', 'Eccles', 'Mr', 'Woodhouse', 'was', 'great', 'just', 'Timothy', 'Peters', 'role', 'Mr', 'Elton', 'Debbie', 'Bowen', 'was', 'perfect', 'Harriet', 'Smith', 'pretty', 'empty-headed', 'honest', 'feelings', 'clearly', 'great', 'awe', 'Emma', 'superiority.I', 'also', 'liked', 'Ania', 'Marson', 'Jane', 'Fairfax', 'however', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'life', 'why', 'had', 'change', 'story', 'Mr', 'Dixon', 'whom', 'Emma', 'imagines', 'be', 'love', 'Jane', 'instead', 'being', 'Ms', 'Campbell', 'Jane', 'close', 'friend', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'Jane', 'place', 'governess', '.The', 'other', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'missed', 'was', 'chemistry', 'Emma', 'Mr', 'Knightley', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'spice', 'film', 'was', 'non-existent', 'said', 'correct', 'adaptation', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'more', 'things', 'find', 'wanting']",N/A
823941,A2ZY5IX8MDRJY7,B000244F64,Lloyd J. Peasley,"[2, 3]","This adaptation dates from the days before Jane Austen was Sexed Up and brought - heaving bosoms and all - into the modern world. So we get no scenes concocted by the writers, and not remotely hinted at in the original novel, of our hero plunging spontaneously into the pond in such a way as to evoke his Hidden Sensuality. Not a whiff of repressed sexuality intrudes; no, what we have here is very much what the author wrote and thus is likely to be considered stolid and dull by viewers steeped in modern-day Austen adaptations. The actors are relatively ordinary-looking and were obviously not selected primarily for their sex-appeal, there is very little ""emoting"" or ""passion"" (even of the underlying, Freudian-repressed kind), and the emotional crescendi never move beyond a mezzo-forte. Within its technical limitations (4/3 ratio, some 1970's graininess, slightly faded colours, drab exterior shots) it also looks both attractive and authentic. You could while a lot of hours away just looking at the furniture, prints, decorations, and general decor. Has there ever been an era with more perfect taste than the Regency period?The acting is almost uniformly excellent in a slightly musty, old-fashioned way that may seem tedious to some viewers but I find it very Austen-like (after all, the early 19th Century IS somewhat musty and old-fashioned). I can only say that if you find this boring you're likely to find the original so as well.

There is a lack of vivacity that I've come to associate with Emma, but she is witty and over the course of this lengthy production (about 4.5 hours long), her character grew on me. The chemistry between Emma and Mr. Knightley which was quite apparent in the Gwyneth Paltrow and Garai versions is sadly lacking here, but some of the other characters are quite well done.Debbie Bowen's Harriet Smith is one of my personal favorites, and I think the actress portraying Harriet really gets her character down to a tee.
