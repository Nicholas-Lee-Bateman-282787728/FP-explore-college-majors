This same scenario was used in his 1968 movie Pretty Poison.) His sister Julie Harris takes him in reluctantly. Her father died in the fire and the two had an unusual relationship. Pretty soon Anthony is starting to go mad again. Or is someone just playing with him? For a tv movie this is pretty good. Anthony Perkins and Julie Harris both give nice laid back performances.

Allen (Perkins) ends up in a mental institution after witnessing his father's death in a house-fire. He now suffers from a blindness, brought on by the incident. Upon his release, Allen moves back in w/ his sister, and the fun begins! Because of his condition (he can only see light and dark, everything is foggy), Allen ""sees"" things that may or may not be what he thinks they are. This becomes fairly creepy when someone begins messing w/ Allen's mind about his father's demise! A mysterious boarder adds to the mystery, nearly sending poor Allen back to the bin! Both Perkins and Harris are quite good in their roles. Joan Hackett (lovely as ever) plays the helpful neighbor.

In point of fact, it is a most accomplished, gripping, and well acted affair, from the days when a ""made for TV"" movie, could still boast performers, writing, and technical credentials of the first water.The story is an intense, psychological study of a young man suffering from hysterical blindness following the death of his professor father in a fire. Set in a large, shadowy, Victorian house, this very gothic story hinges on the sibling rivalry between the young man and his spinster sister, both of whom blame themselves, in different ways, for their father's demise. Eventually, the young man's sanity begins to give way, in the face of a series of inexplicable hauntings, which may, or may not be supernatural. Only the denouement will tell.With its pronounced subtext of repressed, family guilt, the film has literary antecedents in the work of Shirley Jackson, Walter De La Mare, and Nathanial Hawthorne.Starring a cast of major (big screen) movie and stage actors, this film has everything that is conspicuously absent in current television: an excellent musical score, evocative photography, (including characterization through color schemes), muted lighting, accomplished art direction, an interesting premise and script, intelligent dialogue, (gasp!)and a very good sense of pacing.Add to that, a baseline story that improves on the novel upon which it was based, (yes I read it) and you have a viewing experience very different from the ""made for TV's"" of today, which are,(I'm told--since I don't watch them) an endless stream of tedious, politically correct, AIDS,[...], and spouse abuse victim propaganda studies--I believe the catch phrase is ""victim of the week"" stories.)All in all, ""How Awful About Allan"" serves as a sad reminder of what was still artistically possible in the world of commercial television, in earlier times.",4,Effectively morbid psychological thriller.,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,1942,"['inexplicable', 'reason', 'telefeature', 'rarely', 'accorded', 'respect', 'point', 'fact', 'most', 'accomplished', 'gripping', 'well', 'acted', 'affair', 'days', 'when', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'could', 'still', 'boast', 'performers', 'writing', 'technical', 'credentials', 'first', 'water.The', 'story', 'intense', 'psychological', 'study', 'young', 'man', 'suffering', 'hysterical', 'blindness', 'following', 'death', 'professor', 'father', 'fire', 'Set', 'large', 'shadowy', 'Victorian', 'house', 'very', 'gothic', 'story', 'hinges', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'young', 'man', 'spinster', 'sister', 'whom', 'blame', 'different', 'ways', 'father', 'demise', 'Eventually', 'young', 'man', 'sanity', 'give', 'way', 'face', 'series', 'inexplicable', 'hauntings', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'supernatural', 'Only', 'denouement', 'will', 'tell.With', 'pronounced', 'subtext', 'repressed', 'family', 'guilt', 'film', 'literary', 'antecedents', 'work', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'Walter', 'De', 'La', 'Mare', 'Nathanial', 'Hawthorne.Starring', 'cast', 'major', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'stage', 'actors', 'film', 'everything', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'current', 'television', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'evocative', 'photography', 'including', 'characterization', 'color', 'schemes', 'muted', 'lighting', 'accomplished', 'art', 'direction', 'interesting', 'premise', 'script', 'intelligent', 'dialogue', 'gasp', 'very', 'good', 'sense', 'pacing.Add', 'baseline', 'story', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'yes', 'read', 'have', 'viewing', 'experience', 'very', 'different', 'made', 'TV', 'today', 'are', ""'m"", 'told', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'endless', 'stream', 'tedious', 'politically', 'correct', 'AIDS', '[', ']', 'spouse', 'abuse', 'victim', 'propaganda', 'studies', 'believe', 'catch', 'phrase', 'victim', 'week', 'stories', 'How', 'Awful', 'Allan', 'sad', 'reminder', 'what', 'was', 'still', 'artistically', 'possible', 'world', 'commercial', 'television', 'earlier', 'times']",N/A
876143,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0006ZXJ5C,Michael Butts,"[4, 4]","This review is of the notrious Madacy version.  Madacy has been known over the years to release extremely poor copies of movies that almost look like they were taped from a VHS.  The colors are grainy, the sound is muted, and the overall enjoyment is hampered.  For instance, in this version, a key scene at the end is overpowered by the musical score so we don't really know what the character was saying.  As for the movie itself, one can only respect Anthony Perkins, Julie Harris and Joan Hackett for rising above their lame material.  Scripted by Henry Farrell and directed by Curtis Harrington, HOW AWFUL ABOUT ALLAN is an Aaron Spelling television movie made in 1970.  As typical of that time frame, the movie is slow and tries to build suspense with endless shots of Perkins' view of the world through his psychologically blinded eyes.  After his release from a mental hospital following the burning death of his father, Perkins returns home to live with his scarred sister Harris, whose face was disfigured when she tried to rescue her father.  Harris' relationship with the father is veiled with suggestive innuendo and an unnatural desire to please ""this great man.""  Hackett is the neighbor Olive who obviously has her own desires for Perkins, and why we don't ever really know.  He's obviously Norman Bates-ish, and what woman in her right mind would want to spend her life with him.  Anyway, the movie plods along with the chance that Perkins is seeing and hearng things, a mysterious roomer who never shows up, an old boyfriend of Harris' who does show up, and an ending whose ambiguity is frustrating.Not a total dud; it's always nice to see the three stars work, but it's not that suspenseful and the transfer is criminal.",2,HOW AWFUL ABOUT THIS TRANSFER,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,1739,"['review', 'notrious', 'Madacy', 'version', 'Madacy', 'been', 'known', 'years', 'release', 'extremely', 'poor', 'copies', 'movies', 'almost', 'look', 'were', 'taped', 'VHS', 'colors', 'are', 'grainy', 'sound', 'muted', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'hampered', 'instance', 'version', 'key', 'scene', 'end', 'overpowered', 'musical', 'score', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'character', 'was', 'saying', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'respect', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'rising', 'lame', 'material', 'Scripted', 'Henry', 'Farrell', 'directed', 'Curtis', 'Harrington', 'HOW', 'AWFUL', 'ABOUT', 'ALLAN', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'television', 'movie', 'made', '1970', 'typical', 'time', 'frame', 'movie', 'slow', 'tries', 'build', 'suspense', 'endless', 'shots', 'Perkins', 'view', 'world', 'psychologically', 'blinded', 'eyes', 'release', 'mental', 'hospital', 'following', 'burning', 'death', 'father', 'Perkins', 'home', 'live', 'scarred', 'sister', 'Harris', 'face', 'was', 'disfigured', 'when', 'tried', 'rescue', 'father', 'Harris', 'relationship', 'father', 'veiled', 'suggestive', 'innuendo', 'unnatural', 'desire', 'please', 'great', 'man', 'Hackett', 'neighbor', 'Olive', 'who', 'obviously', 'own', 'desires', 'Perkins', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'know', 'obviously', 'Norman', 'Bates-ish', 'what', 'woman', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'want', 'spend', 'life', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'plods', 'chance', 'Perkins', 'seeing', 'hearng', 'things', 'mysterious', 'roomer', 'who', 'never', 'up', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'Harris', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'ending', 'ambiguity', 'frustrating.Not', 'total', 'dud', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'three', 'stars', 'work', 'not', 'suspenseful', 'transfer', 'criminal']",N/A
