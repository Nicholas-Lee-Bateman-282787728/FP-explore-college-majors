1354268,ATCM1W7HWIC6U,B003MAY3JY,Amanda,"[0, 0]","I've done Amy Dixon's Breathless Body 2 and Give Me 10!, and this is another workout of hers that I'll be adding to my rotation. Some of her quirks from earlier workouts (""I trust..."", ""a-MAZ-ing"") have been toned down in this video, so she's actually very fun and motivating to listen to. As is, this workout is probably at a medium-to-high-intermediate level, but the moves can be easily modified up or down. The toning and cardio sections progress up from very basic movements to more intense versions of each exercise. So, to modify up, which I had to do for some segments, just don't follow her through the progressions and jump straight to the highest intensity level. (This requires that you've previewed the moves to know in advance what the hardest level is though.) Also, you can use heavier weights and lunge deeper in the toning sections; in the cardio sections, add jumps for an increased plyometric element, ankle weights, and go faster than Amy does.I was a little disappointed that the abs bonus wasn't that difficult. I felt like she only did half the number of reps that would have been necessary for a full core workout. However, by this point, I was so tired from the main workout that I didn't care too much. I'm so used to Cathe's killer floor toning that I've just come to expect it from all videos!",5,Another winner from Amy Dixon,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,1322,"[""'ve"", 'done', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'Breathless', 'Body', '2', 'Give', 'Me', '10', 'workout', 'hers', ""'ll"", 'be', 'adding', 'rotation', 'quirks', 'earlier', 'workouts', 'trust', 'a-MAZ-ing', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'video', 'actually', 'very', 'fun', 'motivating', 'listen', 'As', 'workout', 'probably', 'medium-to-high-intermediate', 'level', 'moves', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'modified', 'up', 'down', 'toning', 'cardio', 'sections', 'progress', 'up', 'very', 'basic', 'movements', 'more', 'intense', 'versions', 'exercise', 'So', 'modify', 'up', 'had', 'do', 'segments', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'progressions', 'jump', 'straight', 'highest', 'intensity', 'level', ""'ve"", 'previewed', 'moves', 'know', 'advance', 'what', 'hardest', 'level', 'Also', 'can', 'use', 'heavier', 'weights', 'lunge', 'deeper', 'toning', 'sections', 'cardio', 'sections', 'add', 'jumps', 'increased', 'plyometric', 'element', 'ankle', 'weights', 'go', 'faster', 'Amy', 'does.I', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'abs', 'bonus', 'was', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'felt', 'only', 'did', 'number', 'reps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'full', 'core', 'workout', 'However', 'point', 'was', 'so', 'tired', 'main', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', ""'m"", 'so', 'used', 'Cathe', 'killer', 'floor', 'toning', ""'ve"", 'just', 'come', 'expect', 'videos']",Super Fit Bod!

I didn't feel as sore afterward as I do with her other DVD's and for some reason I felt maybe the production of this one was rushed or not planned out as well as her others.

I decided to try this after reading the reviews on Amazon and I am SO glad I did! You need a step bench (more effective) and dumbbells.

I purchased a step deck but had no DVD's to use it in a full routine.  This one delivers.  In fact, I still struggle to keep up, and I am fit.  Even the warm-up leaves you breathless.  Great workout, challenging in the cardio but the moves are not difficult really.  I like this, but a beginner may not, but she moves right into the moves with no learning curve at all.  I like it because I hate a DVD that has a learning curve and then there's no option to delete once you master it and you're stuck with a slow moving workout.  This DVD does not do this.  You will eventually master the moves and then keeping up with her will be challenging.

1354274,A28FJ93TJSSQS4,B003MAY3JY,LMS,"[11, 12]","THis video should really be a bigger hit.  It is really a fantastic video.  I bought this because it made it into Fitness magazines top videos of 2010.  That was the first time I had heard of Amy Dixon but she will definitely be on my radar after this. This is an interval style workout that is aimed at intermediate to advanced exercisers and there are some really challenging moves!  This workout only requires hand weights and a step.  There are some plyometric exercises and a decent amount of moves that are high impact.  If you have bad knees, you may want to be careful.The workout starts with a basic warmup and then moves into the interval section.  They alternate weight work with cardio step work.  The step work is easy to follow (no learning curve and I am hopelessly uncoordinated when I work out at 5 am).  Each interval builds on itself, she starts basic and then adds to the moves.  The routine is fast paced and doesn't drag (actually this one flies by) and there are interesting moves that I haven't seen before.Amy gives excellent cueing and has a very engaging and likable personality (she comes across as very sweet).  Her cueing is excellent.  The only flaw I found with this video was with the camera work (and this was only a minor issue).  There were a couple of spots where the camera angle was not optimal for seeing how the move was performed.I would definitely recommend this video to anyone who wants a well made challenging workout.",5,excellent total body workout,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,1464,"['THis', 'video', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'bigger', 'hit', 'really', 'fantastic', 'video', 'bought', 'made', 'Fitness', 'magazines', 'top', 'videos', '2010', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'heard', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'radar', 'interval', 'style', 'workout', 'aimed', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'are', 'really', 'challenging', 'moves', 'workout', 'only', 'hand', 'weights', 'step', 'are', 'plyometric', 'exercises', 'decent', 'amount', 'moves', 'are', 'high', 'impact', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'may', 'want', 'be', 'careful.The', 'workout', 'basic', 'warmup', 'then', 'interval', 'section', 'alternate', 'weight', 'work', 'cardio', 'step', 'work', 'step', 'work', 'easy', 'follow', 'learning', 'curve', 'am', 'hopelessly', 'uncoordinated', 'when', 'work', 'out', '5', 'am', 'interval', 'basic', 'then', 'moves', 'routine', 'fast', 'paced', ""n't"", 'drag', 'actually', 'one', 'flies', 'are', 'interesting', 'moves', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before.Amy', 'excellent', 'cueing', 'very', 'engaging', 'likable', 'personality', 'very', 'sweet', 'cueing', 'excellent', 'only', 'flaw', 'found', 'video', 'was', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'only', 'minor', 'issue', 'were', 'couple', 'spots', 'where', 'camera', 'angle', 'was', 'not', 'optimal', 'seeing', 'how', 'move', 'was', 'performed.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'well', 'made', 'challenging', 'workout']",Super Fit Bod!

Jillian Michaels doesn't hold a candle to Amy.)  Amy gets my booty into shape like no one else in the world.  But I have to say, this one is by far the most difficult she's ever created, and I LOVE IT!Super Fit Bod is a total body shredder.  I've felt the typical Amy Dixon's next-morning-burn after her past DVD workouts, but boy oh boy, this one takes the cake.  Basically it's a bunch of cardio intervals mixed with strength training that keeps you moving the entire time.  You use hand weights and a step (although if you don't have a step, you're okay.  One of the girls in the background did a modification without one.)  I thought I was melting with all the sweat I lost.  But sweat = pounds!  And if I did this DVD only once a week, I'd probably drop a few more!This one is a great addition to my Amy Dixon rotation for those days where I feel like I really need to kick my butt.

I knew it needed one when I out the DVD but I was too lazy to buy it and thought I'd try it without the bench. It works but it's a liitle awkward w/o it. I didn't do the sections that seemed to require more use of the step. I worked up a sweat nonetheless. But I do plan on getting a step!Amy is a great instructor. Not annoying or overly peppy. I also like the fact that she does the workout as well and doesn't spend half the time demonstrating the workout with the two assistants.UPDATE: 09/13/2011  Ok so I got a step and good grief this is a tough workout! I used only one rise on each side and man I couldn't even finish the disc.
