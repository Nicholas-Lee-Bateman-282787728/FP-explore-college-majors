1535650,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B007P6ISAQ,Addicted2Amazon!,"[38, 40]","When I first came across this DVD, it piqued my interest.  It looked like a different, fun and effective Tracy Anderson-like workout (I really enjoy Tracy's style of workouts) and seemed to have a crowd of loyal fans singing its praises.  When I finally got it home and watched it, however, two things became apparent to me:1. This is a very effective and challenging workout. And2. It has a very high annoyance factor.  Too high for me, in fact.The instructor has come up with some unique body sculpting mat moves utilizing nothing but your own resistance, a set of light weights and a stability ball.  The style seems to be a aerobic/tone blend, with low-impact cardio moves interspersed with toning moves.  Even the toning moves, however, are done at a super-fast pace (TOO fast for me...It seems like there is a whole bunch of flailing around at times and form is sacrificed to speed).  It appears to be an actual class that is being filmed, so there is the instructor and a large group of women all working out and sweating their faces off (no makeup or hair artists here!).These exercises are definitely tough and will get you in shape.And now for my MAIN two deal breakers as far as this program is concerned.  The first is the instructor.  Darby comes across as very likeable, but she NEVER.  SHUTS. UP. EVER.  No, I'm not exaggerating.  She yells constantly in a hoarse run-on cheerleading voice and NEVER takes a breath. Her voice is just as constant as the background music. I own a lot of workout DVDs.  There's chatty...and there's this woman.  Wo[...] It may work in a class setting, but it doesn't work on a DVD.And then there's the pop-up testimonials (think VH1's ""Pop-Up Video"") that randomly pop up throughout the workout.  The music (and of course, the instructor) is muted and you get to hear the ""Fusionistas"" (Darby's students)talk about how hard/nice they find the workout and how you shouldn't give up.  This is a very nice idea...as an OPTION.  You should be able to SELECT the Pop-Up testimonial feature.  Trying to work out and having to keep sitting through these random cheerleading episodes is a serious turn-off for me.  There also is a Pop-Up bubble at the beginning of each exercise showing proper form.  It's done kinda strangely b/c this bubble pops up and starts floating around the screen...But this can actually be helpful since some of the students in the class do not have the best form.Many women love this workout.  It is certainly effective and unique.  But it's just got a bit too much going on for me.  I thought I'd try something a little different, but...No. As far as mat workouts are concerned, I prefer Tracy Anderson and Exhale Core Fusion.  (Tracy Anderson, though far from perfect, has a much more laid-back style [standing abs notwithstanding! :-)], slower, cleaner form and does not talk unnecessarily.  Much of the time, it is just you, her, the music and the exercises...Which is all I need!!)",2,A Good Workout Is Ruined by Too Much...Everything,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,2951,"['When', 'first', 'came', 'DVD', 'piqued', 'interest', 'looked', 'different', 'fun', 'effective', 'Tracy', 'Anderson-like', 'workout', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Tracy', 'style', 'workouts', 'seemed', 'have', 'crowd', 'loyal', 'fans', 'singing', 'praises', 'When', 'finally', 'got', 'home', 'watched', 'however', 'two', 'things', 'became', 'apparent', 'me:1', 'very', 'effective', 'challenging', 'workout', 'And2', 'very', 'high', 'annoyance', 'factor', 'Too', 'high', 'fact.The', 'instructor', 'come', 'up', 'unique', 'body', 'sculpting', 'mat', 'moves', 'utilizing', 'nothing', 'own', 'resistance', 'set', 'light', 'weights', 'stability', 'ball', 'style', 'be', 'aerobic/tone', 'blend', 'low-impact', 'cardio', 'moves', 'interspersed', 'toning', 'moves', 'Even', 'toning', 'moves', 'however', 'are', 'done', 'super-fast', 'pace', 'TOO', 'fast', 'whole', 'bunch', 'flailing', 'around', 'times', 'form', 'sacrificed', 'speed', 'be', 'actual', 'class', 'being', 'filmed', 'instructor', 'large', 'group', 'women', 'working', 'out', 'sweating', 'makeup', 'hair', 'artists', 'here', '.These', 'exercises', 'are', 'definitely', 'tough', 'will', 'get', 'shape.And', 'now', 'MAIN', 'two', 'deal', 'breakers', 'as', 'far', 'program', 'concerned', 'first', 'instructor', 'Darby', 'very', 'likeable', 'NEVER', 'SHUTS', 'UP', 'EVER', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'exaggerating', 'constantly', 'hoarse', 'run-on', 'cheerleading', 'voice', 'NEVER', 'breath', 'voice', 'just', 'as', 'constant', 'background', 'music', 'own', 'lot', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'chatty', 'woman', 'Wo', '[', 'may', 'work', 'class', 'setting', ""n't"", 'work', 'DVD.And', 'then', 'pop-up', 'testimonials', 'think', 'VH1', 'Pop-Up', 'Video', 'randomly', 'up', 'workout', 'music', 'course', 'instructor', 'muted', 'get', 'hear', 'Fusionistas', 'Darby', 'students', 'talk', 'how', 'hard/nice', 'find', 'workout', 'how', 'should', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'very', 'nice', 'idea', 'OPTION', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'SELECT', 'Pop-Up', 'testimonial', 'feature', 'Trying', 'work', 'out', 'having', 'keep', 'sitting', 'random', 'cheerleading', 'episodes', 'serious', 'turn-off', 'also', 'Pop-Up', 'bubble', 'beginning', 'exercise', 'showing', 'proper', 'form', 'done', 'kinda', 'strangely', 'bubble', 'up', 'floating', 'screen', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'helpful', 'students', 'class', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'best', 'form.Many', 'women', 'love', 'workout', 'certainly', 'effective', 'unique', 'just', 'got', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'No', 'As', 'far', 'mat', 'workouts', 'are', 'concerned', 'prefer', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'Exhale', 'Core', 'Fusion', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'though', 'far', 'perfect', 'much', 'more', 'laid-back', 'style', '[', 'standing', 'abs', 'notwithstanding', ']', 'slower', 'cleaner', 'form', 'not', 'talk', 'unnecessarily', 'Much', 'time', 'just', 'music', 'exercises', 'Which', 'need']",Fusion Fitness Dream Body Workout
1535651,AWGD0ACATDBKT,B007P6ISAQ,"Cobra Chick ""Miss Tea""","[4, 4]","This is one of those workout videos I avoided for the longest time because of the cover. It looks ""dumb"". And then the comments talk about the ""bubble girl"". Okay. Totally not my style. I finally picked it up, and holy cow.......what a workout! I had a hard time keeping up, broke a sweat in the freezing basement, and was sore for two days afterwards. This is going in the regular weekly workout rotation!I don't mind the bubble girl, who shows you proper form. This is a high intensity workout, and proper form is important, especially if you have injuries as I do. I don't like the Fusionista's talking about how great the workout is- I can tell how great it it - I couldn't do the whole thing the first two times through it. That said, I liked this workout enough to buy Fusion's new 5 disk set that they just started selling. It's even harder than this, but minus the annoyance factors.This is a butt kicking, fat-burning workout, that is not for the faint of heart, or out of shape. It moves very quickly, and some of the moves are tricky at first. It takes some time to master them. I like that in 1 hour, it manages to hit every muscle group - hard. So, if you're on the fence, and put off by the dumb-looking cover, look past it.

For those who were influenced by such unfounded concerns, I purchased mine from Amazon (not realizing it was a DVD-R and I don't seem to notice a difference now that I know) after looking at a preview on Totalfitnessdvds.com and have reviewed many items including workout DVDs, and some also very enthusiastically as well. As a fitness buff with a large workout DVD collection, I get very excited when I find something new that provides variety and is very challenging for me at my level. It is an advanced workout with a lot of cardio and familiar barre type exercises woven throughout it. I love how it incorporates the stability ball for core in the way that Cathe Friedrich does, and that it never stops or slows down till the delicious stretch at the end. I highly recommend this for someone who wants to add more cardio to their barre toning and is a fan of Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre workouts.

I mainly do barre workouts (Tracey Mallett, Bar Method, Phyisque 57).  my main goal when working out is to stay toned. I dont need to lose weight so I choose things that dont have as much cardio in them. If you love a lot of intense cardio and working up a sweat then you will probably love this. For me i found my neck ached pretty bad after, probably from so many mountain climber reps. Its just personal choice. My legs tend to bloat too with too much much cardio and i like them slim and lean like how barre workouts keep them. Its not a bad workout if you like high intense workouts but i really have to be into it to keep up the workout and I just wasnt with this.

1535655,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B007P6ISAQ,Leanne,"[3, 4]","I just got done doing this for the first time, and liked it overall.  It's different from the other barre/fusion workouts I have (I have P57, Pop Physique, Core Fusion, Squeeze, Ballet Body, and Ballet Beautiful, amongst others), and I love how it doubles as a cardio workout since the moves have you sweating.  It reminds me most of Pop Physique and Squeeze, but is different enough to warrant purchase.To do the workout, you'll need a set of 1- or 2-pound dumbbells, a mat, and a stability ball.The workout uses mostly small pulsing moves with the weights, mixed in with lots of plank and push-up variations, which I loved.  Darby also really targets the triceps a lot, which is nice for those of us over 40 who are fighting the bat wings. She uses the stability ball in the last part of the workout to work the legs, and does so in some unique ways.This would be a five-star workout for me if it weren't for these drawbacks:* the constant pop-ups made it hard for me to both see and hear Darby's cueing; at several times during the workout, I hadn't even realized that she had gone on to a new move since the person was still talking; these were extremely annoying, and I can only imagine that they'll be even more so as I do the workout more (I need to see if they get turned off if you go for the ""music off"" option)* the ""Bubble Girl"" that pops in and out (Darby dressed in various costumes) was useful to see form, but she was often doing the moves differently than Darby's lead in the actual workout -- and her facial expressions looked like a scary Barbie doll; I appreciate that they were going for something different, but having a ""normal-looking"" Darby instead would have been a whole lot better* the workout also comes in at about 65 minutes long, and the final stretch is only done on one side, before the screen fades outOverall, I can see that doing this workout on a regular basis will definitely yield results, but I just wish that it didn't have these annoying features.UPDATE ON 12/31/12:  Fusion Fitness just released a five-DVD set that is fantastic!  All of the bothersome aspects of the first Dream Body DVD (like the pop-ups, frantic pacing, etc.) are gone, and the new set is a lot of fun!

1535661,A2ZBLDZ0Y1NGWH,B007P6ISAQ,Nancy S.,"[28, 44]",I'm always looking for new fun fitness dvd's.  When I saw this new DVD I wanted to check it out.  Every reviewer has such great things to say I wanted to see what their other reviews were like.  Not one had any other review other than this DVD.  This just doesn't seem right.  I guess I won't be ordering this DVD until I see some real reviews.,1,Something Fishy.,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,344,"[""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'new', 'fun', 'fitness', 'dvd', 'When', 'saw', 'new', 'DVD', 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'reviewer', 'such', 'great', 'things', 'say', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'reviews', 'were', 'like', 'Not', 'one', 'had', 'other', 'review', 'other', 'DVD', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'guess', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'ordering', 'DVD', 'see', 'real', 'reviews']",Fusion Fitness Dream Body Workout
1535662,A10KO7JBBIYRL2,B007P6ISAQ,Nanyamka Sandusky,"[2, 3]","Okay so I am a big fan of Tracy Anderson and Physique 57. This workout is like combining Tracy Anderson, Physique 57, and Jillian Michaels workouts.  I did this workout on a sprained ankle.  I wanted to try it so bad.  I did not workout to my full potential.  I am a seasoned exerciser who runs 4 miles and works out 5 to six days a week.  I could not do all the reps in this workout.  I had to modify alot because of my sprained ankle.  I was still sweating when the workout was done.  She starts and does not stop or take breaks the whole hour.  You are working your arms, stomach, legs, buns, everything at full speed ahead.Ten minutes into the workout I thought 30 minutes had passed.  I would recommend doing this workout twice a week or every other day. It's an excellent video to add to your workout rotation.  I am from Virginia Beach and I have never been to any of her studios.  Some of the reviews on amazon were wondering if some of the reviews were fake.  Definitely not.If you love TA, Physique 57, The Bar Method try doing this workout.  It will definitely take some time for me to build up to doing the reps.  I hope she records more videos.  Again this is for anyone.  I modified most of the moves but when my ankle gets better I hope to do this with all of my energy.  If you don't get fit and toned doing this daily then your eating way too much junk.I would give this ten stars if I could.  It is worth paying the $30.00.Do yourself a favor-and buy the video already!!!!!",5,Burn baby burn,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,1491,"['Okay', 'so', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'Physique', '57', 'workout', 'combining', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'Physique', '57', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'workouts', 'did', 'workout', 'sprained', 'ankle', 'wanted', 'try', 'so', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'full', 'potential', 'am', 'seasoned', 'exerciser', 'who', '4', 'miles', 'out', '5', 'six', 'days', 'week', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'reps', 'workout', 'had', 'modify', 'alot', 'sprained', 'ankle', 'was', 'still', 'sweating', 'when', 'workout', 'was', 'done', 'not', 'stop', 'take', 'breaks', 'whole', 'hour', 'are', 'working', 'arms', 'stomach', 'legs', 'buns', 'everything', 'full', 'speed', 'ahead.Ten', 'minutes', 'workout', 'thought', '30', 'minutes', 'had', 'passed', 'would', 'recommend', 'doing', 'workout', 'twice', 'week', 'other', 'day', 'excellent', 'video', 'add', 'workout', 'rotation', 'am', 'Virginia', 'Beach', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'studios', 'reviews', 'amazon', 'were', 'wondering', 'reviews', 'were', 'fake', 'Definitely', 'love', 'TA', 'Physique', '57', 'Bar', 'Method', 'try', 'doing', 'workout', 'will', 'definitely', 'take', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'doing', 'reps', 'hope', 'more', 'videos', 'Again', 'anyone', 'modified', 'most', 'moves', 'when', 'ankle', 'better', 'hope', 'do', 'energy', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'fit', 'toned', 'doing', 'daily', 'then', 'eating', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'junk.I', 'would', 'give', 'ten', 'could', 'worth', 'paying', '30.00.Do', 'favor-and', 'buy', 'video', 'already']",Fusion Fitness Dream Body Workout
