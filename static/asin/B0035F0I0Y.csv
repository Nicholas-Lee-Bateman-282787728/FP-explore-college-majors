1326324,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B0035F0I0Y,Amit Talpade,"[1, 1]","Karthik Calling Karthik attempts a psychological mystery which to a certain extent manages to get the job done, keeping you entertained and guessing till the very end. Some of the more clever viewers would probably figure out the ending in advance. I did not and couldn't but that is just me as I just roll with the punches.Karthik played by Farhan Akhtar is shy and introverted; he is picked on by colleagues and does not have any friends. He secretly pines for Shonali ( Deepika Padukone ) but ends up losing her to a more aggressive colleague. Things are dismal, until one day he receives a phone call. Life starts undergoing a change; he finds confidence, success at work and even manages to woo Shonali. Life is great, but one day he breaks the rules imposed on him by the secret caller.I liked the movie and it was not just interesting but beautifully shot as well. The makers have managed to make even the most drab places look sophisticated. The music is quite catchy especially Uff Teri Ada.  The second half of the movie could have used some editing and better writing but ....The movie belongs to Farhan Akhtar who acts well and delivers his best performance so far after Luck by Chance. Deepika manages to look pretty.

In any case it's unusual to see a suspenseful psychological drama of this quality coming out of India (at least to be seen in the US). The script and plot were well constructed for the subject matter and besides presenting a quite realistic, well researched, portrayal of the problem it allowed for the audience to participate in identifying the source of this problem while maintaining our uncertainty and thus kept us guessing. The acting was spot on - not overwhelming and not insipid. The setting and camera work were effectively minimalist so as not to distract from the drama in the story. I would give it five but for the ending which I feel should have been as bold and dramatic as the rest of the film. Also, the flashbacks, normal for this genre, and are meant to help the audience finalize the ending and the events that led us there were a bit overdone.",4,Psychological Drama,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,932,"['will', 'avoid', 'discussing', 'particulars', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun', 'case', 'unusual', 'see', 'suspenseful', 'psychological', 'drama', 'quality', 'coming', 'India', 'least', 'be', 'seen', 'US', 'script', 'plot', 'were', 'well', 'constructed', 'subject', 'matter', 'presenting', 'quite', 'realistic', 'well', 'researched', 'portrayal', 'problem', 'allowed', 'audience', 'participate', 'identifying', 'source', 'problem', 'maintaining', 'uncertainty', 'thus', 'kept', 'guessing', 'acting', 'was', 'spot', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'not', 'insipid', 'setting', 'camera', 'work', 'were', 'effectively', 'minimalist', 'so', 'not', 'distract', 'drama', 'story', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'ending', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'bold', 'dramatic', 'rest', 'film', 'Also', 'flashbacks', 'normal', 'genre', 'are', 'meant', 'help', 'audience', 'finalize', 'ending', 'events', 'led', 'were', 'bit', 'overdone']",Karthik Calling Karthik

Is there no end to this kind of crap that this industry keeps churning out? Farhan Akhtar should stick to directing. I am not sure where he got the idea that he can act. One of the biggest flaws of this film is how it fails on its most basic level. The writer(s)didn't think it's important to explain how the main character played by Akhtar becomes so psychologically messed up! It's a painful two hour movie and I would suggest turning to a film from Akhtar's better days like, Dil Chata Hai.

I was not expecting much since I simply bought it to see the context of it's most successful song, ""Uff Teri Adaa"". But from the beginning I was hooked by the clever plot line and the endearing characters, none of whom I knew from other works. I won't spoil the Hitchcock-like fun of the plot other than to say that the resolution/conclusion is not in any way contrived or a cheat (like aliens are to blame or it was just a dream). If there is any shortcoming to the conclusion it's that it is too well explained. I immediately had to watch the movie again to find the subtle clues and with the director's commentary it was even more fun and entertaining. All the music is appropriate and fitting, the language clean (PG in my estimation with nothing remotely racy), and the characters sweet and charming. Cinematography is not something I typically notice, but the filming was superb. I show this movie over and over to new audiences who always love it and want to know more about it so I give it my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!",5,An All-time Favorite,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1111,"['Sharp', 'sophisticated', 'movie', 'just', 'risen', 'Top', 'Movies', 'All-time', 'list', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'simply', 'bought', 'see', 'context', 'most', 'successful', 'song', 'Uff', 'Teri', 'Adaa', 'beginning', 'was', 'hooked', 'clever', 'plot', 'line', 'endearing', 'characters', 'none', 'whom', 'knew', 'other', 'works', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'Hitchcock-like', 'fun', 'plot', 'other', 'say', 'resolution/conclusion', 'not', 'way', 'contrived', 'cheat', 'aliens', 'are', 'blame', 'was', 'just', 'dream', 'shortcoming', 'conclusion', 'too', 'well', 'explained', 'immediately', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'find', 'subtle', 'clues', 'director', 'commentary', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'music', 'appropriate', 'fitting', 'language', 'clean', 'PG', 'estimation', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'racy', 'characters', 'sweet', 'charming', 'Cinematography', 'not', 'something', 'typically', 'notice', 'filming', 'was', 'superb', 'show', 'movie', 'new', 'audiences', 'who', 'always', 'love', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'so', 'give', 'HIGHEST', 'RECOMMENDATION']",Karthik Calling Karthik
1326329,AW7P8LRCFHFSG,B0035F0I0Y,Z.B,"[1, 1]","As the strange name ""Karthik calling Karthik"" forces you to think about movie, ditto with the well maintained suspense. It forces you or better says engages you for 2.5 hrs that most other bollywood movies never accomplished even for few mins. It's nice to see lot of bollywood movies coming up with tight script and engaging direction. Even most traditional film director/actor is coming with as bold movie as ""My name is Khan""!! . As bollywood is always blessed with powerful actors, but it's only since last few years we are seeing above par script and well crafted direction, and on top of that versatility of subject selection is like icing on cake. Let's hope this trend will continue.As movie is suspense thriller, it's not worth to discuss story. At glance it look more like beauty and geek kind of material, but turns into more meaningful storyline that keeps you engaging till end. As for Deepika, she is still learning and did as expected to do but Farhan Akhatar is improving with every film. At first he started acting for fun, but now he seems more sincere about the same.Nothing negative about this movie.All in all KCK is one more movie from bollywood this year that is worth watching",4,A Captivating Film!,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,1200,"['strange', 'name', 'Karthik', 'calling', 'Karthik', 'forces', 'think', 'movie', 'ditto', 'well', 'maintained', 'suspense', 'better', 'engages', '2.5', 'hrs', 'most', 'other', 'bollywood', 'movies', 'never', 'accomplished', 'even', 'few', 'mins', 'nice', 'see', 'lot', 'bollywood', 'movies', 'coming', 'up', 'tight', 'script', 'engaging', 'direction', 'Even', 'most', 'traditional', 'film', 'director/actor', 'coming', 'bold', 'movie', 'name', 'Khan', 'bollywood', 'always', 'blessed', 'powerful', 'actors', 'only', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'are', 'seeing', 'par', 'script', 'well', 'crafted', 'direction', 'top', 'versatility', 'subject', 'selection', 'icing', 'cake', 'Let', 'hope', 'trend', 'will', 'continue.As', 'movie', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'not', 'worth', 'discuss', 'story', 'glance', 'look', 'more', 'beauty', 'geek', 'kind', 'material', 'more', 'meaningful', 'storyline', 'engaging', 'till', 'end', 'Deepika', 'still', 'learning', 'did', 'as', 'expected', 'do', 'Farhan', 'Akhatar', 'improving', 'film', 'first', 'started', 'acting', 'fun', 'now', 'more', 'sincere', 'same.Nothing', 'negative', 'movie.All', 'KCK', 'one', 'more', 'movie', 'bollywood', 'year', 'worth', 'watching']",Karthik Calling Karthik
