He said (I Paraphrase) ""Decent cast can't save this pedestiran script."" He also goes on to write how the movie sat on the shelf for two years. He is right. I noticed the copyright on the DVD box was 1993 while at the end credits they said 1991. According to Wikipedia the movie was released on September 11, 1991 (More On That Later) This movie really did it for me.Ironic, because it is a movie that I would never have purchased had I not by chance ssen it advertised on the back end of an old VHS tape. I bought the movie a couple of years ago and saw it on last night. The opening sequence did it all for me. That is where all of the principle characters were introduced in a six degrees of separation sequence where they literally walk or drive by one another within the space of minutes. Unbeknownst to each other, they will strike up a lifelong friendship that goes through many trying times.I won't go through each character's situation, save to say that they are broken down into wealthy, upper-middle class, and middle class households. I cared for the characters and while Cybill Sheppard's character was a bit vacuous, even she grew on me at the end. I couldn't help but lament the loss of the World Trade Center as the Twin Towers are shown majestically from what I believe is Staten Island (Please Feel Free To Comment If I'm Mistaken) where the ladies are having their get together mid-way through the movie.This is certainly a movie I recommend to lovers of romantic comedies. The movies most hilarious moment comes when the kids of John and Iris Morden ask them if they ever ""dropped acid."" They turn to their kids with ""shock"" and say, ""No, we never did drugs in our lives!"" I laughed so hard I almost had tears. Not that they said it, but that it was said with a straight face!Buy this movie or rent it. It's one of Hiller's best, despite what the critics said about it.A.

The only halfway decent storyline involves the last couple, a couple of former hippies dealing with their kids and sticking to their 1960's principals.  Other than a few good zingers (esp. the one Cybill Shepard says to her stepdaughter in a clothing store), this film never rises to the drama level it's reaching for.",2,Bland Story,1004659200,"11 2, 2001",2001,511,"['film', 'three', 'couples', 'different', 'stages', 'marriages', 'pair', 'newlyweds', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'walked', 'aisle', 'again', 'respective', 'divorces', 'long', 'wedded', 'couple', 'only', 'halfway', 'decent', 'storyline', 'last', 'couple', 'couple', 'former', 'hippies', 'dealing', 'kids', 'sticking', '1960', 'principals', 'Other', 'few', 'good', 'zingers', 'esp', 'one', 'Cybill', 'Shepard', 'stepdaughter', 'clothing', 'store', 'film', 'never', 'drama', 'level', 'reaching']",Married to It VHS

These three couples have little in common beside the school where they meet at a PTA conference. The acting of Mary Stuart Masterson is first class. In fact the acting of the three female leads keeps the whole thing from descending into a treacly mess.

479763,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305812195,Reviewer,"[11, 11]","A common thread provides the bond that draws three diverse couples  together, ultimately leading to a friendship through which they explore the  foibles of life and love in ""Married To It,"" an engaging look at  contemporary relationships and perspectives, directed by Arthur Hiller.  There's John and Iris (Beau Bridges and Stockard Channing), a jaded social  worker and the wife of many years who sees him through it all, has given  him two children (now preteens) and only of late has come to realize that  he's given up on her and on life in general; Chuck and Nina (Robert Sean  Leonard and Mary Stuart Masterson), an ambitious investment broker and his  wife, a school psychologist; and Leo and Claire (Ron Silver and Cybill  Shepherd), a toy manufacturer and his second wife, a sophisticated woman of  society who is unable to make a connection with his daughter, Lucy (Donna  Vivino).  A school function and commitment to a committee bring them  together, and they soon find that although they each compete in different  arenas of life, they are in the end not so different from one another after  all.  In fact, they soon come to depend and rely upon their newly founded  friendships more than any of them could ever have imagined possible.  Hiller has crafted an emotionally stirring study of want, need and  expectation that will be readily identifiable to just about anyone who has  taken part in the game of life.  And it's skillfully delivered through an  outstanding ensemble cast, highlighted by the exceptional work of Stockard  Channing, a gifted actress who seems to thrive in a project like this.  She  brings Iris to life from the inside out and creates that necessary  connection with the audience that spills over onto the rest of the cast,  all of whom deliver dynamic performances as well, most notably Cybill  Shepherd as the aloof sophisticate who finally realizes what is really  important in life.  But what really makes this movie work is the depth of  character that  each of the actors involved brings to the core of the  story.  It's as if the derive energy and incentive from one another; and  when actors can give as much as they receive, as they do here, it shows in  the polish of the finished product.  That they all worked so well together  also reflects the skill of the director, and Hiller obviously did a  fantastic job of creating an atmosphere in which his actors could excel.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Don Francks (Sol), Jimmy Shea (Marty),  Nathaniel Moreau (Kenny) and Diane D'Aquila (Madeleine).  One of the great  things about the video revolution is that terrific movies like this one,  that for whatever reason go largely unnoticed in theatrical release, get a  second life and with any luck the attention they so justly deserve.  ""Married To It"" is a sleeper you should shout about from the rooftops; it's  a well made movie with exemplary performances, a great story and a terrific  ending.  A film as good as this simply cannot be ignored, because this, my  friends, is what movies are all about.  This is one you have to see and  tell your friends about.",4,Hiller And A Great Cast Deliver,968025600,"09 4, 2000",2000,3121,"['common', 'thread', 'bond', 'three', 'diverse', 'couples', 'together', 'ultimately', 'leading', 'friendship', 'explore', 'foibles', 'life', 'love', 'Married', 'engaging', 'look', 'contemporary', 'relationships', 'perspectives', 'directed', 'Arthur', 'Hiller', 'John', 'Iris', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'jaded', 'social', 'worker', 'wife', 'many', 'years', 'who', 'given', 'two', 'children', 'now', 'only', 'late', 'come', 'realize', 'given', 'up', 'life', 'general', 'Chuck', 'Nina', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'ambitious', 'investment', 'broker', 'wife', 'school', 'psychologist', 'Leo', 'Claire', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'toy', 'manufacturer', 'second', 'wife', 'sophisticated', 'woman', 'society', 'who', 'unable', 'make', 'connection', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Donna', 'Vivino', 'school', 'function', 'commitment', 'committee', 'bring', 'together', 'soon', 'find', 'compete', 'different', 'arenas', 'life', 'are', 'end', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'one', 'fact', 'soon', 'come', 'depend', 'rely', 'newly', 'founded', 'friendships', 'more', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'imagined', 'possible', 'Hiller', 'crafted', 'emotionally', 'stirring', 'study', 'want', 'need', 'expectation', 'will', 'be', 'readily', 'identifiable', 'just', 'anyone', 'who', 'taken', 'part', 'game', 'life', 'skillfully', 'delivered', 'outstanding', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'highlighted', 'exceptional', 'work', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'gifted', 'actress', 'who', 'thrive', 'project', 'Iris', 'life', 'inside', 'necessary', 'connection', 'audience', 'rest', 'cast', 'whom', 'deliver', 'dynamic', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'notably', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'aloof', 'sophisticate', 'who', 'finally', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'life', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'work', 'depth', 'character', 'actors', 'involved', 'brings', 'core', 'story', 'derive', 'energy', 'incentive', 'one', 'when', 'actors', 'can', 'give', 'as', 'much', 'receive', 'do', 'here', 'polish', 'finished', 'product', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'also', 'skill', 'director', 'Hiller', 'obviously', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'actors', 'could', 'excel', 'Rounding', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'Don', 'Francks', 'Sol', 'Jimmy', 'Shea', 'Marty', 'Nathaniel', 'Moreau', 'Kenny', 'Diane', ""D'Aquila"", 'Madeleine', 'One', 'great', 'things', 'video', 'revolution', 'terrific', 'movies', 'one', 'reason', 'go', 'largely', 'unnoticed', 'theatrical', 'release', 'get', 'second', 'life', 'luck', 'attention', 'so', 'justly', 'deserve', 'Married', 'sleeper', 'should', 'shout', 'rooftops', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'exemplary', 'performances', 'great', 'story', 'terrific', 'ending', 'A', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'friends', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'about', 'one', 'have', 'see', 'tell', 'friends']",Married to It VHS
