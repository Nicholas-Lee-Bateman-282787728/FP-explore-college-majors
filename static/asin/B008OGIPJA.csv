1572222,A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1,B008OGIPJA,"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11""","[0, 0]","Post Oscars update: I'd like to thank The Academy for awarding best actress to Jennifer Lawrence, whose performance was outstanding, and also for recognizing the ultimately ordinary backbone of this film that sent the best picture prize to a different movie.The fawning of critics and the accompanying cavalcade of Oscar nominations set the bar high for seeing this movie near the end of its in-theater run. Then, as the credits rolled, I felt cheated. This is not a bad movie, but it's a movie that fell surprisingly short of the high expectations that come with critical acclaim and multi-category Oscar buzz. The crusty presence of Robert Di Niro and an intricately woven thread of football fandom don't fully conceal the chick flick at the gooey center of this movie.The comedy part of this ""romcom"" genre is adult, dark, farcical and football-centered enough to allow males to retain their man card if they watch this on anything other than a first date. But fellas, you have been warned (and this is in no way a spoiler): never forget the outcome of the movie hinges on the outcome of a ballroom dance contest. We've been here before so many times. ""Flashdance"" and ""Dirty Dancing"" are calling, and they want their endings back.As for all of the chatter about honest views of mental health problems: the mental health discussion is as superficial as the paen to NFL football fandom. This glossing over leaves us with something a little more gritty than most of its categorical kin. What remains is a movie about the under-appreciated underdog entrants in a dance contest.Not glossed over is in-your-face product placement. Post Raisin Bran (who knew cereal was a relationship signpost?), Apple hardware (so what's new?) and Seroquel (possibly a big screen first for a powerful anti-psychotic medication) get almost as much screen time as Di Niro. In the words of Liz Lemon: what the what?Good enough to pay full price at the theater? Yes.Worth paying for a streaming view or DVD rental? Yes.Oscar worthy?

1572228,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B008OGIPJA,Ace Reader,"[2, 5]","Romance Comedy/Drama ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a winner! After viewing this film I can see why it's been nominated for eight Academy Awards. It deserves to be nominated because it's so completely entertaining and well made. This unique character driven screenplay is expertly written and directed by Academy Award nominated David O. Russell. Mr. Russell decided to make this film because of it's story-line about family relationships, but also because of his son who is bipolar and has OCD.""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a story about Pat Jr. who is placed in a Mental Institution after an outbreak of violence towards his wife when he comes home to find her cheating on him with another man. He is released and wants to reconcile with his wife. He meets a mysterious neighbor girl with problems of her own. From this point forward this story becomes upbeat. This film does have some predictable parts in it, but that's okay because you want to see these predictable parts play out. The ending is very satisfying.""Silver Linings Playbook"" is based on the novel by the same name written by author Matthew Quick. Many of this films cast members have been nominated for Academy Awards. They are; Best Actress nomination goes to Jennifer Lawrence (known for her recent role Katniss in director Gary Ross's 2012 ""Hunger Games""), for her portrayal of OCD character Tiffiny. Bradly Cooper (known for his role Eddie Morra in director Neil Burger's 2011 ""Limitless""), preforms Pat Solitano who's character is central to this story. Robert De Niro (known as Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's 1976 ""Taxi Driver""), is fantastic as Pat's OCD old-man bringing excellent character acting and charm to his role. Australian actress Jackie Weaver (known for her role as Janine 'Smurf' Cody in director David Michod 2010 ""Animal Kingdom""), is amazing as Pat's Jr. mom and wife to De Niro's character Pat senior. The remaining three Academy Award nominations are for, Best Film Editing by Jay Cassidy and Crispin Struthers, Best Adapted Screenplay written by director David O. Russell and Best Picture. Interestingly, this picture has become the first to earn nods in all four acting categories since (Reds) and the first ""Big Five"" (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Writing) nominee since ""Million Dollar Baby"".Anne Hathaway was originally cast opposite Bradly Cooper, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Mark Walberg was cast first in the lead role but director David O. Russell decided to go with Bradly Cooper instead. The results of the Eagles & Phillies game mentioned in this film is real taking place in 2008.This film kept me totally mesmerized planted in my seat. Go see this funny, character driven, crazy wild ride. You won't be sorry. Highly recommended.

1572229,ASZGADJQT6ET4,B008OGIPJA,Adam Gagnon,"[0, 0]","From [...]A gripping, charming, hilarious, and moving movie about a couple troubled people making life work in their own way. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are both at the absolute top of their game. Both actors deliver mesmerizing Oscar worthy performances and sell what was already a fantastically written script. In a smaller support role that turns out being a lot more important than at first glance, Robert De Niro brings one of the most moving performances in his recent career.When Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is released from a court ordered stay in a mental institution he moves back in with his parents. Pat&#8217;s goal is a new attitude, fitness, and to reconcile with ex-wife. His behavior is obsessive and he has no filter on what comes out of his mouth but it is clear Pat isn&#8217;t an overall bad guy. As pieces of his past are filled in, the depth of the character comes into focus. Pat Senior (Robert De Niro) at first comes off as a smaller role who throws out a couple snappy one liners but doesn&#8217;t amount to much. As the story continues and Pat Jr. and Sr. interact more it becomes very clear how Pat turned out the way he did. Pat Sr. isn&#8217;t a bad man or a bad father and mental illness can not be blamed on the individual but the personality traits carried through father and son are very well laid out and subtle. At a dinner with some old friend Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). The two seem to have no chemistry at all but end up bonding over their own social issues and medications they have been on. After a couple seeming random encounters the two form a unique and borderline hostile friendship. The friendship deepens and Pat agrees to help Tiffany with a dance competition she has been training for.Silver Linings Playbook was advertised primarily as a comedy, the movie is very funny. As funny as the movie is it is also very deep and moving when it needs to be. Director David O. Russell really strikes a perfect balance between the deep emotions and hysterics that are delivered perfectly by the amazing cast. Along the way as Pat and Tiffany grow closer Playbook could easily have derailed and became one of several typical romantic-comedies that get churned out every year. Bradley Cooper would have needed to flash a smile and Jennifer Lawrence bear her emotions after indulging in expensive ice cream and the movie could have been shipped, sold and forgotten about. Instead the audiences were served a spectacular story about family, friends, redemption, moving forward and all forms of love. The various levels of the movie don&#8217;t just make it interesting to experience but give a lot of re-watch value beyond the humor and amazing performances. The writing is so well done that everything can&#8217;t possibly be absorbed one time through but nothing is obtuse.Bradley Cooper has been acting for a while now and has moved steadily up into meatier roles. He has proven he can handle comedy in popular movies like Wedding Crashers (2005) and The Hangover (2009), he handled action in The A-Team, and has had more than his fair share of romantic comedies. While always delivering for the part he was given Silver Linings Playbook is the first time he got to fully stretch his legs and show off what he can do as an actor. In the best performance of his career so far (no doubt that there is more amazing performances to come from him) Cooper plays Pat perfectly. At times he is bouncing off the walls and at other times he is angry beyond comprehension but Cooper always brings these extremes up to the line but never crossing into doing too much. Jennifer Lawrence hasn&#8217;t been acting for quite as long but started her career fairly young and has had a variety of roles. Her first leading film role was in Winter&#8217;s Bone (2010) and she proved that she has what it takes to be a leading actress. As good as Lawrence did in Winter&#8217;s Bone and her other movies leading up to Silver Linings Playbook, Playbook was a whole new league to the caliber of acting Lawrence is capable of. Tiffany is a more damaged character than Pat in some way and Lawrence gives the audience no choice but to feel for her. Her performance is incredibly moving while she teeters on the brink of incredibly strong or cracked and fragile. Robert De Niro gives his strongest performance in years as well. De Niro plays a man his age, a husband and a father. There is none of the typical De Niro &#8220;cool&#8221; or toughness that seems to follow him to the majority of his roles. Taking that away he is left as a very real man. He wasn&#8217;t a perfect father or husband but a man who tried his best and he feels completely real. Pat Sr. has some obsessive compulsive tendencies, a gambling problem, and a horrible temper. A lot of these traits can be seen in both of his sons in the movie and the progression is subtle, but makes all the characters that much more complete. The supporting case is also impeccable. Chris Tucker makes his first appearance in 2005. He provides some great comedic relief and doesn&#8217;t overstay his welcome. It was nice seeing Tucker in a tame but still hilarious role since in the bast he mostly overacted and was always over the top. Jacki Weaver, Dash Mihok, John Ortiz, Shea Whigham, and Julia Styles round out the rest of the cast with smaller but very important parts.Silver Linings Playbook is absolutely one of the best movies of it&#8217;s year. Every element of the film clicks into place perfectly. There is something for every movie-goers taste and Cooper and Lawrence prove that they are a couple actresses that audiences will be seeing a lot more of in the future.",5,My Silver Linings Playbook

Brooks' Academy Award winner may not always be easy to watch, but never fails to be worthwhile in its portrayal of mental illness and family dysfunctionality.  We spend the entire film wondering if Bradley Cooper's character will ever find that &#34;silver lining&#34; in life, and just waiting for him to ruin any opportunity create a relationship with Jennifer Lawrence and to find a way to mend his relationship with his dad, Robert deNiro.  Brooks arrays a variety of colorful characters for us to laugh and suffer with as we watch two generations of Philadelphians find their way through life's potholes.  But in the end, we are uplifted -- as teeteringly as Cooper lifts Lawrence in the dance number -- but uplifted nonetheless.  Under Brooks' deft directing, each character seems to mesh with the others, and everything somehow fits together for the best.  I found the portrayal of Cooper's psychiatrist to be truly unusual compared with the usual arm-s length relationship between patient and client.  Cooper's love and appreciation for the &#34;curry-eaters&#34; flies in the face of typical prejudicial views of dark-skinned foreigners, as the film uses the universal love of sports to prove how little people's ethnic differences really matter.  Cooper is always on the verge of flying into uncontrolled rages over the loss of his wife, and you wonder until the very end of the film whether he can get this part of his life under control.  In the extras, director Brooks talks about mental health problems with his own son, and how they became a inspiration for this movie.  This is a great film to share with friends and family members who have faced emotional problems because it shows both the harsh reality of such issues and the possibilities for finding that &#34;silver lining.&#34;  Highly recommended.",5,Sensitive treatment of a complex topic,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,1830,"['James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'easy', 'watch', 'never', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'portrayal', 'mental', 'illness', 'family', 'dysfunctionality', 'spend', 'entire', 'film', 'wondering', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'character', 'will', 'ever', 'find', '34', 'silver', 'lining', '34', 'life', 'just', 'waiting', 'ruin', 'opportunity', 'create', 'relationship', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'find', 'way', 'mend', 'relationship', 'dad', 'Robert', 'deNiro', 'Brooks', 'variety', 'colorful', 'characters', 'laugh', 'suffer', 'watch', 'two', 'generations', 'Philadelphians', 'find', 'way', 'life', 'potholes', 'end', 'are', 'uplifted', 'as', 'teeteringly', 'Cooper', 'Lawrence', 'dance', 'number', 'uplifted', 'nonetheless', 'Brooks', 'deft', 'directing', 'character', 'mesh', 'others', 'everything', 'somehow', 'together', 'best', 'found', 'portrayal', 'Cooper', 'psychiatrist', 'be', 'truly', 'unusual', 'compared', 'usual', 'arm-s', 'length', 'relationship', 'patient', 'client', 'Cooper', 'love', 'appreciation', '34', 'curry-eaters', '34', 'flies', 'face', 'typical', 'prejudicial', 'views', 'dark-skinned', 'foreigners', 'film', 'universal', 'love', 'sports', 'prove', 'how', 'little', 'people', 'ethnic', 'differences', 'really', 'matter', 'Cooper', 'always', 'verge', 'flying', 'uncontrolled', 'rages', 'loss', 'wife', 'wonder', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'part', 'life', 'control', 'extras', 'director', 'Brooks', 'talks', 'mental', 'health', 'problems', 'own', 'son', 'how', 'became', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'great', 'film', 'share', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'have', 'faced', 'emotional', 'problems', 'harsh', 'reality', 'such', 'issues', 'possibilities', 'finding', '34', 'silver', 'lining.', '34', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Silver Linings Playbook

You know a guy who would root himself hoarse at a Phillies' game, or for the Flyers, or the `76ers (forget U/Penn though) and would go absolutely bonkers (maybe I sure reserve the use of that would here), would get heated up a lot, okay, at an Eagles football game. A guy who would, maybe, know how to make use of a good buffalo wings recipe or the secrets of a good place to get a good cheese and steak submarine sandwich. See a regular Philly guy, okay. Regular except for a little, uh, mental problem, a bi-polar problem, a little problem that got to be a big problem when his ever-lovin' wife proved unfaithful to him, as some wives will, proved unfaith though maybe because he spent just a little too much time cheering on those sports teams and not enough time being, well, being a well-rounded modern man. And our regular Philly guy went a little overboard in reaction to that treachery and wound up in a mental institution, complete with ""meds"" to calm him down. Oh yah, and despite those quirky little characteristics he is a voracious reader, a cowboy intellectual (although perhaps I should also reserve the word cowboy as well). Either way keep that reader thing under your hat since ""real"" Philly guys are too busy to read.Let's say while our regular Philly guy, Pat to give him a name, was getting well (and not getting within shouting distance of his wife under penalty of another stretch, maybe some prison time the next time) and trying to make himself worthy of his wife's affections when she comes along. The she in question being another of the world's waif, Tiffany, who has her own set of, uh, mental problems but who came on board to try to get Pat through his rough spots on the road to reuniting with his wife.And let's say that Ms. Tiffany is, well, kind of screwy, kind of outdoes Pat in the screwy department. At least for a while. On the face of it one regular Philly guy (albeit with those little problems mentioned above), and one screwy Philly dame with her own set of high octane problems would be strictly oil and fire. No go, nada, get lost. Except she had a thing for regular Philly guys with problems, or for one Philly guy with problems. And so to lure the unsuspecting Pat in she, as part of an agreement to with him to contact his wife, bargains him into becoming her amateur night dancing partner. Just partners that's all. As it turns out, they aren't half bad after a ton of practice and a road strewn filled with pitfalls. See too, though as it turned out he developed a thing for regular (if screwy) Philly gals (or gal).Now let's say all this happened, plus a few odd-ball things around Pat's family issues, then you would have a very amusing and well-produced romantic comedy for the 21st century.

I know, it isn't really supposed to be a rom-com, but since this movie pretty much has it all it can be anything you want it to be.  What I particularly love about this movie is that the moments of sadness do not overwhelm the rest of the plot.  It is a movie where the motto is Excelsior and every scene of this movie exemplifies that.While I'm sure many go to see movies like Black Swan and Girl, Interrupted believing that is what mental illness is all about as a person who has struggled those movies mean nothing to me.  Instead this shows a better pantheon of emotions about how society deals with those who have mental illness than either of those movies(and I understand Girl, Interrupted is about a memoir but that doesn't make it realistic). In fact the plot is so poignant about what it feels like to have the stigma of mental illness with you out in the world that it is clear this film was personal to the director/screenwriter.The acting is astounding, with Jenifer Lawrence shining like a diamond.

1572270,A2EL3990HXOMZB,B008OGIPJA,Antonio Robert,"[1, 2]","""Sliver Linings Playbook"" easily ranks among the best romantic comedies of the third millennium (eight Oscar nominations are a good proof of that). Although it contains elements of drama or psychological movie, at heart it is indeed a romance, with some fresh quirkiness, similar to films like ""Juno"" or ""Little Miss Sunshine"", thrown in.To a wide movie-going audience, the picture rather realistically depicts the inner torture that adults go through following such stressful situations as death of a spouse or marital infidelity. First half of the movie is steeped in depicting - with sympathy and insight - the predicament of Pat Salatano (Bradley Cooper), who, after eight months in mental hospital for attacking his unfaithful wife, must still cope with a restraining order and fits of temper. The film's second hour, with Pat's hesitating affair with young widow Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) taking center stage, is even more rewarding for a viewer, with details and paradoxes of life in current America blossoming fully in the script, decently adapted from the Matthew Quick's bestseller (by director David O.Russell).The film's main asset is the cast - every single role gets more than a capable actor to play. Bradley Cooper's natural style in a difficult role complements well with a star-making turn of Jennifer Lawrence. Salatano parents, the superstitious, illegally-bookmaking football fanatic dad (Robert DeNiro) and the anxious, ever-loving and sacrificing mom (Jacki Weaver) clearly project the movie's forgiving, understanding attitude toward its characters.The finale makes a silver lining of its own for the story, accentuating its positive outlook on life. And although the movie cannot avoid some cliches regarding positiveness and family life misgivings, these are not overly stressed. Thinking viewers would probably welcome some more of Pat's thinking and reasoning - mainly in the final parts of the movie we must be satisfied only with some shortcuts of his mind - yet it can be safely said that ""Silver Linings Playbook"", for all its ventures into dark recesses of human soul, is a worthy addition to contemporary romantic comedy.",4,Fighting Life's Adversities Is Worth the Effort,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,2165,"['Sliver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'easily', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'third', 'millennium', 'eight', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'are', 'good', 'proof', 'elements', 'drama', 'psychological', 'movie', 'heart', 'indeed', 'romance', 'fresh', 'quirkiness', 'similar', 'films', 'Juno', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'in.To', 'wide', 'movie-going', 'audience', 'picture', 'rather', 'realistically', 'inner', 'torture', 'adults', 'go', 'following', 'such', 'stressful', 'situations', 'death', 'spouse', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'First', 'half', 'movie', 'steeped', 'depicting', 'sympathy', 'insight', 'predicament', 'Pat', 'Salatano', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'who', 'eight', 'months', 'mental', 'hospital', 'attacking', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'must', 'still', 'cope', 'restraining', 'order', 'fits', 'temper', 'film', 'second', 'hour', 'Pat', 'hesitating', 'affair', 'young', 'widow', 'Tiffany', 'Maxwell', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'taking', 'center', 'stage', 'even', 'more', 'rewarding', 'viewer', 'details', 'paradoxes', 'life', 'current', 'America', 'blossoming', 'fully', 'script', 'decently', 'adapted', 'Matthew', 'Quick', 'bestseller', 'director', 'David', 'O.Russell', '.The', 'film', 'main', 'asset', 'cast', 'single', 'role', 'more', 'capable', 'actor', 'play', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'natural', 'style', 'difficult', 'role', 'complements', 'well', 'star-making', 'turn', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Salatano', 'parents', 'superstitious', 'illegally-bookmaking', 'football', 'fanatic', 'dad', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'anxious', 'ever-loving', 'sacrificing', 'mom', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'clearly', 'project', 'movie', 'forgiving', 'understanding', 'attitude', 'characters.The', 'finale', 'silver', 'lining', 'own', 'story', 'accentuating', 'positive', 'outlook', 'life', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'avoid', 'cliches', 'regarding', 'positiveness', 'family', 'life', 'misgivings', 'are', 'not', 'overly', 'stressed', 'Thinking', 'viewers', 'would', 'probably', 'welcome', 'more', 'Pat', 'thinking', 'reasoning', 'mainly', 'final', 'parts', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'satisfied', 'only', 'shortcuts', 'mind', 'can', 'be', 'safely', 'said', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'ventures', 'dark', 'recesses', 'human', 'soul', 'worthy', 'addition', 'contemporary', 'romantic', 'comedy']",Silver Linings Playbook

Its a Dark humor but the kind of humor thats actually funny and not over the top. Everyone in this film is dysfunctional and don't even realize it. I love films like this when they are NOT trying to be funny but just generally messed up people. The movie hits on alot of stereotypes of people and how they relate. Tiffany was the type of woman that I have always wished for . She was sexy without trying Dark, Tough, Straight forward, and Sensual. The thing I loved the most about her character is you could tell the love she had for Pat was special. She didn't show that side to everyone and it was very obvious. She was a hard girl but a vunerable kitten to Patrick. Thats when you know a person really loves you and only you. When you see a certain side of a person and noone else gets that same pleasure.Pats wife was the stereotypical Prissy type along with Tiffany's sister (Julia Stiles). Jennifer Lawrence deserves everything she recieved for her performance. She was very convincing through out the entire film. You could see her love and pain through out the film. I really felt sorry for her because Pat was so cruel at times even just right out mean and judgmental. But for what ever reason she still wanted him and didn't give up. The thing that enamored me the most is that he didn't have anything to offer. But yet instill she loved him unconditionaly and still wanted to be apart of his life. The Dinner, Jogging scenes and at the Cafe are absolutley classic and unforgettable. This is a film that will stand the test of time for many years to come or even generations. You only get one of these types of films like every 7 to 10 years. The last time I felt this intrigued by a film was when Matchpoint (2005) and Closer (2004) came out. U just don't get many realistic straight forward films in Hollywood anymore. There is alot of great dialogue in this film that is unforgettable.Although Closer and Matchpoint are two totally different types of films. They are still just as unique and intoxicating as Silver Linings. Robert Deniro did his part as usual and his character was quirky as well. In the end the movie shows how people can be judged and what society deems as a normal person or trophy wife. Bradley Cooper's Character was somewhat judmental and very closed minded . He felt by society standards his ex cheating wife was the perfect woman. But in the end he realized what he needed and what was best for him. Which I am certainly glad he figured it out before it was too late. I can say with out doubt it would have haunted him for the rest his life.

The acting is great, the set up for the story is fascinating and laugh out loud funny at times. But it isn't without its problems.Pat and Tiffany both have mental disorders that are played as humorous, but if we actually stop to think about the message this movie is sending this seems in poor taste. There are times where the disorders are thoughtfully depicted and the consequences clearly on display, and when this happens this movie shines. How Bradley Cooper plays Pat is one of the best performances of the year in any genre. He is completely convincing. Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany is less so. We do find out why she is so caught up with sex, but the answers fell flat for me. She came off as less someone to feel sorry for and more someone to avoid. I think it's more the writing than the acting here, because later in the film, when it takes the easy way out for the finale, she all the sudden has interests and information that her character shouldn't have if she were really as lost as Pat.One other thing: this movie is so vulgar at times that it shocked me out of my enjoyment of the film. Many of the newer films that are supposed to be romantic [something, be it drama, comedy, whatever] are so vulgar now that it makes date night less fun and romantic and more cringe worthy and uncomfortable for those of us who don't toss out the F-Bomb every few words. (SLIGHT SPOILER: For instance, the very first night they meet, Pat is walking Tiffany home - how that happens is brilliant - but then says to him out of nowhere, ""You can come in and F me if you want to if you turn out the lights"" (because she hates his Jets jersey.)

Jennifer Lawrence completely takes over this movie, in a good way.  She and Robert De Niro's performances are the reasons to watch this movie.  I loved Robert De Niro's subtle depiction of his own mental illness; clearly the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.  I found this very realistic and true to my own life experience. The only puzzlement to me is how she fell in love with that dweebie simp, Pat, who is clearly still obsessed with his ex. Though in the book as in the movie, Tiffany falls for Pat almost immediately. It had to be his rockin' abs. Bradley Cooper, a fine actor in other vehicles, is too old to play Pat, for one thing.  The age difference between the actors distracted me here. I think what the movie does best, like the book, is show the complexity and reality of dealing with mental illness, both from the family's and the individual's standpoint. I loved the families depicted in this movie; they adjust to the reality of dealing with their family members' illness and support them.

In fact, the only reason I saw the film was because of Jennifer Lawrence, whose sophisticated performance in WINTER'S BONE convinced me I'd seen the breakthrough of a gifted actress.Well, I was wrong about Cooper, wrong about De Niro's inclusion, wrong about a formulaic script, and dead-on about Jennifer Lawrence.  Simply stated, this quirky, brilliant story of the evolution of love between two world-worn, emotionally troubled people -- against the chaotic background of family madness -- was one of the most satisfying, funny and affecting movies I've seen in recent years. In terms of clarity, continuity and heart, it surpasses the book on which it was based.Since others have described the plot on this page, I will say that millions of viewers who have not seen the film will find parts of their emotional lives in the trials of the lead characters. They will marvel at Bradley Cooper's jaw-dropping portrayal of of a man shackled by the manic phase of bipolar disorder. They will wince at those moments in which the love between the principals starts to emerge, and falters. They will discover a performance by Lawrence that is comfortably sensual, and an actress who is equally powerful whether she is mute or screaming.The script is complex and masterfully written, with surprising outburst of pathos and hilarity. The climax of the film -- and I won't enter a spoiler here -- caught me by surprise.  I wept at the beauty of it, the director's mastery of realism, and the restoration of originality and complexity to American comedy.It may be that we're all fundamentally ""crazy"" and that these two lovers legitimize the chaos we feel inside.  It may also be that the art direction, score, supporting performances (De Niro is simply wonderful) and choreography are jaw-dropping.  In the end, it's the confluence of so many virtues that make this film as fine as it is. For Bradley Cooper, it's a career-defining moment  For Jennifer Lawrence, it's confirmation of what the wise always believed, and hopefully she'll be spared casting in horror films in perpetuity. She is one of our very best, and her beauty, grace and innate power to inhabit the souls of her characters -- are most unusual.While I've enjoyed it once, I plan to view it again tomorrow evening, will continue to discuss it with friends, and add it to my list of favorites.That's not bad at all.SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a gift.

I hope to change that someday, because it is a city full of history, and I personally have a healthy appreciation for history and the way in which it shapes the world in which we live and the people who we become.Before I confuse you, allow me to point out that Silver Linings Playbook is not a movie about history. But it is a movie set in Philadelphia. And while I've never been there, I have developed a healthy hatred for it. You may say that hatred is baseless, but I say you've never met someone from Philly. Or you're from Philly and lack proper perspective. Admittedly, nearly all of my interaction with Philadelphia and its residents has, to this point in my life, revolved around sports. But Philadelphia athletes do things like electrocute dogs (I will kindly ignore you as you point out he was an Atlanta athlete while he was electrocuting dogs, because we had the benefit of ignorance), and Philadelphia fans are widely acknowledged to be the worst in sports (unless you're from Philly... then they're awesome).You may be wondering why I should be suggesting that you not see a movie because it is set in a city you may or may not hate based almost solely on its relationship with sports. My response would be that Philly is a sports city, and it is defined in major part by its relationship with its sports. Accordingly, this movie, through its characterizations, very much relates to Philadelphia's relationships with its sports. So if you are like me and have a healthy distaste for Philadelphia, its people, or its sports, you may want to avoid watching this.Why you should see it:I said that Silver Linings isn't a movie about history, and that's true. Nor is it explicitly about Philadelphia. But it is a story about people who are the product of Philadelphia's history, and because of that, it couldn't be set anywhere else. Other films have settings that are merely the time and place in which the plot unfolds, but this is a plot that couldn't exist outside of its setting. The result is a story that is unique and compelling to me and yet all too familiar to many Philadelphians.Bradley Cooper has seemingly made a career of playing jerks in his movies, and that actually hasn't changed here. Maybe that's because he's a jerk in real life (you'll never guess the city from which he hails... Philadelphia!). Anyway, in this movie it's almost as if his jerk personality is put back in its natural environment, and the result is a jerk you can pull for. I don't necessarily think he had to stretch his acting abilities all that far to appear in this, but he still does a fantastic job of portraying a man who is wholly unlike me but still completely relatable.You can still get in on the ground floor of Jennifer Lawrence appreciation, since she's only been around for two years. But in those two years, she has two deserved best actress nominations (one of them here) and two roles in fan-pleasing box office genre movies. If she isn't on the fast track to becoming one of Hollywood's (much needed) leading ladies, I just don't know what to say. In Silver Linings, she plays a sort of mirror to Bradley's character, and likewise nails the jerk-for-whom-you-wish-good-things part (and yet she's from Kentucky... go figure).Aside from the two main characters, there are still a few other noteworthy members of the cast. It appears as though this was an opportunity jumped on by Robert DeNiro to get back to quality acting, and I have to say that I've never before been genuinely entertained by Chris Tucker until now. I won't say that they offer any sort of counterbalance or opposition to the off-kilter nature of Cooper or Lawrence, because they don't. Everyone in this film is off his or her rocker at least a little bit, and that's the point.In short:I spent the entirety of Silver Linings torn between wanting to know what happens next and still not wanting to see what happens next. The unorthodoxy of the two leads draws me in in a way that I haven't experienced in a while, and I appreciate the opportunity to care about such flawed individuals. I don't believe Cooper had to reach to play his character, but that doesn't diminish his portrayal at all, and Lawrence keeps step with him the entire time. In the end, I think nothing more than spite for the city of Philly made me leave the rating for this one at an 8 out of 10 instead of more, but I still recommend it for anyone who can enjoy a completely unusual romantic comedy. At least I think that's what it is... I don't know what other category it would fit into.Exceptions to the recommendation:- anyone with a jealous wife or girlfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Jennifer Lawrence in this movie;- anyone with a jealous husband or boyfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Bradley Cooper in this movie;- if you think dancing scenes are stupid and contrived when added into romantic comedies;- people who would like to go on thinking that they're the ones with problems;- anyone who can't handle awkwardness fueled by inappropriate comments;- if you really do

1572313,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B008OGIPJA,Brian Driver,"[8, 14]","NOTE: This review DOES contain SPOILERS!Let me say this one thing to ANYONE reading this review: ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a wonderful movie, and if you have not seen it you should do two things:1. Literally, run out and see it.  Now.  You'll not see a finer ensemble movie this year.  Then,2. Don't read anymore of this review until you do.I am breaking from tradition here.  Generally, I like to write reviews that praise or criticize movies, making sure to tell minimal plot details and, above all else, not to divulge spoilers that might ruin the story for anyone who has not seen it.  This will not be the case here; I was moved enough by this superb movie to want to talk freely about it, and you should STOP HERE IF SPOILERS WILL UPSET YOU.""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a masterful contradiction: a mainstream movie shot like an indie, its rough edges are expressed in broad strokes as well as personal details.  It is loud yet minimal; it is personal, yet speaks to all of us.  It is a movie that is probably about no one you can think of, yet it will resonate with an intimacy that will speak to all of us.""We're not liars like they are,"" Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence in a bravura performance) said in defining her relationship with Pat (Bradley Cooper, truly splendid in this role), and she's right: their respective brushes with mental disorder have somehow left them without the ability to restrain the words we all think but never say.These moments create comedy, but they can also be very uncomfortable.  We find out early they are broken people.  Pat, a teacher, was institutionalized for eight months after he left school early one day, found his wife in the shower with a fellow teacher and almost beat him to death.  Upon Pat's release he is invited to his friend Ronny's house for dinner and it is there he meets the recently widowed Tiffany, whose policeman husband died behind the wheel.  Though Ronnie specifically cautions him not to, his first words to her are, ""How did your husband die?""It is a potentially alienating question, as is their conversation about the medication prescribed to ""help"" them.  Yet Tiffany responds to his honesty and a potential shaky bond is formed.  This candor is foreign to their host; Ronny himself had only just confessed to Pat how the very home improvements he had moments ago been bragging about are strangling him financially.  Urged by Pat to say this to his wife, his host frantically hushes him lest his wife might hear.This openness has its limits; due to the particulars of her relationship with her husband at the time of his death Tiffany is now a recovering sex addict, and Pat's tendency to continually call her a ""slut"" quickly wears thin.  And his inability to see beyond his need to rehabilitate his relationship with his ex-wife Nikki is a continual barrier to his relationship with Tiffany moving forward.Make no doubt about it: Pat is a broken man.  In fact, there are several scenes in the early part of the movie where Pat is seen reading Hemingway'sA Farewell To Armsin an effort to come to fully embrace his wife by reading her curriculum for the school year.  We laugh when he reads the ending of the novel and flings it out the window of his attic bedroom.  ""That book sucks!"" he shouts, complaining about the book's ending, wherein two lovers undergo tremendous hardships in WWI, escape to Switzerland and, when they are finally safe, she dies in childbirth.  He is enraged that Hemingway had the audacity to consider THAT a good and proper ending to a book.  (We'll return to AFTA later.)What is so refreshing about ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is how it all fits together so well and bears up under further scrutiny beyond the simple words of the script.  Their drama may not be Shakespearean in language, but it is still one we recognize as eternal, and digging for symbols is a task refreshingly rewarded.That Pat wears a black Hefty bag through which he's poked neck and arm holes is attributed to the moist Pennsylvanian weather, yet the fact that he sees himself as trash is not without merit.  He is continuously trying to better himself and his station so that Nikki will take him back, yet he is forever stymied by the court order forcing them apart.  That Tiffany offers to carry his letter to Nikki gives her a reason to see him, but her terms of the bargain forces him to continuously practice with her so that she may enter a dance contest some weeks away.  He agrees not only for the purpose of passing on the letter, but so that Nikki may see that he is bettering himself.That Tiffany and Pat's first evening takes place on Halloween bears up as well, as they are the only ones that day unmasked.  Once inside the modest diner he has taken her to he, hilariously, orders Raisin Bran--the breakfast cereal--to make sure their night together is not seen as a formal date.  Understandably, their meal ends with her soon after storming out the door, and in her anger she cries out when he tries to mend things, arousing the public to her cause.  It is her betrayal of him that causes her to see him as a trapped and flawed individual, and she quickly calls off his tormentors.He is alone (his last name, after all, is Solitano), as she is, and he needs someone fiercely--he simply has picked the wrong horse.  For a movie that relies upon gambling so much (more about that later on), is such a metaphorical comparison out of line?It is also at that moment that she witnesses the anguish he feels whenever he hears the Stevie Wonder song ""My Cherie Amour,"" which was not only his wedding song but the song playing while his wife and her lover were showering.  Throughout the early part of this movie the song has plagued him, yet it is Tiffany's penchant for cutting through the superficial that causes her to shout, ""It's just a song; it's not a monster!"" and it is then he finally begins to place the song in perspective.I have not even touched on the wonderful secondary characters in the movie--and how often can one apply such a term to Robert De Niro?  His character of Pat, Sr., has lost his job and is relying upon bookmaking to fund his construction of a restaurant he has dreamed about running all of his life.  While such a dream drives the action of the second half of ""Silver Linings,"" perhaps more important is De Niro's skilled portrayal of a faulted man run by his compulsions, a psychological disorder that also, certainly, had something to do with the Pat's upbringing.  He is a Philadelphia Eagles fanatic; he has recorded and catalogued every game they ever played.  This is odd, but perhaps not worthy of being called ""crazy""; yet we soon find out he has done the same with other items in his house, including blank envelopes. Now, THIS is a compulsion worthy of merit.That Cooper's Pat has trouble with De Niro's Pat is not hard to fathom: after all, his father's repeated pleas to simply spend time with his son at first come across as a man's earnest desire to reconnect with his offspring, and we at first see the younger Pat as being callous for neglecting him.  Yet it is only later that we realize his father really has been harboring a secret motivation: he sees his son as ""lucky"" and wants to use him as one of his ever-present talisman.It is wholly appropriate that when this all reaches a peak, it is Tiffany who sees them through it.In fact, a few revelations later we find it is, as usual, the women who have been pulling the strings all along.  Not only did Tiffany, as she put it, ""do my research"" and point out to Pat, Sr. that his son has been a good luck talisman all along when in HER presence, but we find too that it is Pat's mother who had secretly helped Tiffany corner Pat all along.But the climactic scenes, wherein EVERYTHING comes to a head--the relationship, the dance contest, the restaurant wager and the all-important meeting between Pat and his ex-wife Nikki--Tiffany and Pat finally reveal to each other their love.  ""I loved you when I first met you,"" he declares, ""I just didn't know it at the time.""This is where the movie at once and at last unites with Hollywood and gives us the ""proper"" ending we've hoped for all along--against Hemingway's nihilism and against the cynicism one might expect here.  It is proper, though, that this one hope goes along with Hemingway's famous quote from ""A Farewell to Arms"" (as long as one doesn't read much farther): ""The world breaks everyone, and afterward many are strong in the broken places.""It is quite possible to see just how Pat and Tiffany are, indeed, ""stronger at the broken places,"" and may now achieve their Hollywood ending after all.*  *  *  *  *NOTE: As I write this, Jennifer Lawrence has just picked up a Golden Globe for her stellar performance (it was up for four); that Bradley cooper lost to Daniel Day Lewis in ""Lincoln"" is nothing to be ashamed of.  It is nominated for eight Academy Awards, including the acting quartet, director, adapted screenplay, film editing, and...oh, yes: Best Picture.It achieved an American Film Institute Movie of the Year, and is up for four Screen Actors Guild Awards (Actress, Actor, Supporting Actor, and--the one I love--Best Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture; last year's winner wasThe Help (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)).",5,What a Great Ensemble Movie!,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,9275,"['NOTE', 'review', 'DOES', 'contain', 'SPOILERS', 'Let', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'ANYONE', 'reading', 'review',

1572320,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B008OGIPJA,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","""Crazy doesn't fall far from the tree,"" might be the theme of this very funny film.  Oh, but you may want to add, ""But who cares, as long as you're having fun?""  (I generally look for a strong theme in a film, and if I can't find one, then I consider that to be a bad sign.  This one did have a strong theme to me, perhaps different from the one that I came up with, but it should be noted that, just because I find a theme doesn't mean that I necessarily agree with it.  Doesn't matter.  But that would be an argument for another day. . . .)I really like the way that Robert De Niro's career -- or make that ""careers"" -- have gone.  After all, it seems that within film, he's had two:  the I'm-gonna-kick-your-tail films early on, and then the I'm-gonna-make-you-laugh films later on.  I think that he's been really good at both; you surely can't call him a one-trick pony.  I think that sometimes, people underestimate him on his comedic timing; I think it's almost perfect.  And I really liked him in all those ""Meet the Focker"" films, even though I thought that that series was surely drawing diminishing returns towards the end.And this film reminds me of a Ben Stiller film, but without the mean spiritedness of it all.  You have to admit, Mr. Stiller's films, while being very funny, can dive a little too deep into the depths of humiliation.  This film does not go in that direction.  Sure, it shows the weaknesses of our two protagonists -- and there are surely many -- but it never makes fun of those characters.  Instead, the audience always has empathy for Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, and that was a very wise move.  Wise enough to get Ms. Lawrence an Academy Award, one that I think she probably deserved here.I do have to admit that I believe that some of Ms. Lawrence's films in the past have been somewhat overrated.

He is onscreen virtually all of the time and gives a very nuanced performance, holding his own very well against his major foil in the film, his father played by Robert DeNiro. Although on one level it might seem that Cooper has other foils, the mental illness problems which the two of them exhibit show that both of them mainly battle with mental illness in both its nature and nurture modes. We have many people in my extended family with various forms of mental illness, going back for many generations, so I really could relate to this aspect of this film. The film takes no judgmental stance when it could have become awfully ponderous.Patrick's (Cooper) OCD behavior about his soon to be ex wife, Nicky, really began to grate on my nerves. I've known people like this, who won't shut about some love object they are stuck on it and it becomes as insufferable to the listener in real life as it does in this film.  However, I would guess that Russell, the director, wanted this reaction as it would be a common reaction to this obsessive compulsive behavior. Certainly it only adds to Cooper's performance.Cooper is up for the Oscar.  He faces formidable opposition from Daniel Day-Lewis playing Lincoln, however.  Even if Cooper does not win, being a nominee is a big step upwards for his career.The romantic part of this film prevents it from becoming a real downer about mental illness. A woman in his neighborhood, Tiffany, was recently widowed.  She is attracted to Patrick (Cooper). They begin hanging out together and soon she agrees to give a letter to Nicky if he participates in a dance competition with her. This woman is ably played by the meteoric  star Jennifer Lawrence. We get to see the dance competition and thankfully they do ok but the film does not turn into SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. The romance part of the movie will be universally liked and should help the film do well commercially. Lawrence is up for the Oscar but there is very stiff competition in this category.  Younger actors, like Lawrence, are also more frequently overlooked in favor of the veterans come awards time.There is also humor to the film, most of it coming from DeNiro with the schemes he hatches relative to his obsession with the Philadelphia football team.  This is so extreme that he has been banned from the stadium. Maybe one shouldn't laugh at his OCD behavior on this but much of it was as funny as MONK doing his OCD detecting.  We all know though that DeNiro has great comic talent and he unleashes it here. He is up for supporting Oscar and I think his chances are very good..",5,I understand Jennifer Lawrence's meteoric rise in film now,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,2702,"['anyone', 'been', 'dismissing', 'Cooper', 'just', 'good', 'looking', 'empty', 'headed', 'guy', 'image', 'film', 'onscreen', 'virtually', 'time', 'very', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'holding', 'own', 'very', 'well', 'major', 'foil', 'film', 'father', 'played', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'one', 'level', 'might', 'seem', 'Cooper', 'other', 'foils', 'mental', 'illness', 'problems', 'two', 'exhibit', 'show', 'mainly', 'battle', 'mental', 'illness', 'nature', 'nurture', 'modes', 'have', 'many', 'people', 'extended', 'family', 'various', 'forms', 'mental', 'illness', 'going', 'back', 'many', 'generations', 'so', 'really', 'could', 'relate', 'aspect', 'film', 'film', 'judgmental', 'stance', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'awfully', 'ponderous.Patrick', 'Cooper', 'OCD', 'behavior', 'soon', 'be', 'ex', 'wife', 'Nicky', 'really', 'began', 'grate', 'nerves', ""'ve"", 'known', 'people', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'shut', 'love', 'object', 'are', 'stuck', 'as', 'insufferable', 'listener', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'However', 'would', 'guess', 'Russell', 'director', 'wanted', 'reaction', 'would', 'be', 'common', 'reaction', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'behavior', 'Certainly', 'only', 'Cooper', 'performance.Cooper', 'up', 'Oscar', 'formidable', 'opposition', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'playing', 'Lincoln', 'however', 'Even', 'Cooper', 'not', 'win', 'being', 'nominee', 'big', 'step', 'upwards', 'career.The', 'romantic', 'part', 'film', 'becoming', 'real', 'downer', 'mental', 'illness', 'woman', 'neighborhood', 'Tiffany', 'was', 'recently', 'widowed', 'attracted', 'Patrick', 'Cooper', 'begin', 'hanging', 'out', 'together', 'soon', 'give', 'letter', 'Nicky', 'dance', 'competition', 'woman', 'ably', 'played', 'meteoric', 'star', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'get', 'see', 'dance', 'competition', 'thankfully', 'do', 'ok', 'film', 'not', 'turn', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'FEVER', 'romance', 'part', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'universally', 'liked', 'should', 'help', 'film', 'do', 'well', 'commercially', 'Lawrence', 'up', 'Oscar', 'very', 'stiff', 'competition', 'category', 'Younger', 'actors', 'Lawrence', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'frequently', 'overlooked', 'favor', 'veterans', 'come', 'awards', 'also', 'humor', 'film', 'most', 'coming', 'DeNiro', 'schemes', 'relative', 'obsession', 'Philadelphia', 'football', 'team', 'so', 'extreme', 'been', 'banned', 'stadium', 'Maybe', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'OCD', 'behavior', 'much', 'was', 'as', 'funny', 'MONK', 'doing', 'OCD', 'detecting', 'know', 'DeNiro', 'great', 'comic', 'talent', 'here', 'up', 'supporting', 'Oscar', 'think', 'chances', 'are', 'very', 'good..']",Silver Linings Playbook

There are people with really serious behavioral health issues, and then there is the neat little bow in which the screenplay seeks to tie up those issues, in the form of a love story.  To me, the family dynamics are the most interesting aspect; there are flashes of really great moments between Bradley Cooper and Robert Di Nero as son and father, respectively.  As others have pointed out, the scenes with the family can be difficult to watch -- there is a lot of yelling and physicality between the characters (laced with humor to keep things more edgy than off-putting).  It's clear that Cooper's ""Pat"" isn't the only member of his clan who can benefit from therapy.  Despite the film's emphasis on being positive and its comedic infusions, there's a lot of heavy stuff here -- which is why to me, the rather rapidly paced love story seems out of place.  The movie isn't about a guy going through a mid-life crisis, it's about someone grappling with mental health issues.  It doesn't seem like handing him a ""you complete me"" moment is going to fix that. I'll stop there because I don't want to to take away from how well-acted the movie is and I totally respect the fact that many, many people enjoyed it much more than I did.  I think it comes down to a matter of preference: If you're looking for a darker but still ""Hollywood"" romantic comedy, then you'll probably enjoy this film very much.

1572350,A3DD96LN8U1NM,B008OGIPJA,citygal,"[3, 6]","This movie contains what seems to be two standard components of most movies today:  1) flawed characters who display immature, even aberrant, behavior, even at 40+ years old and whom we're supposed to sympathize with and/or smile at; 2) glorifying characters who act on every emotion they have, particularly if it contributes to their happiness.  This is probably a case of art imitating life, and of course, Hollywood will put a romantic spin on it.  However, I'm so sick of this propaganda and lack of originality that I've stopped going to the movies and pretty soon, I'll be forced to just stop watching new movies altogether. In that this movie was nominated for an academy award (and Jennifer Lawrence won Best Actress for portraying a less-than-challenging part), I think I'm making the right decision.I could tear this movie apart, but I don't want to take the time. I'll just point out two annoyances:1) Why is Nicki's affair shrugged off as if it is nothing?  Why is the movie presenting Pat as the nutty one for beating the crap out of a man he finds in the shower with his wife?? Sorry, but I don't find that reaction strange. I think many men would react similarly at finding some man boffing his wife in their own shower! Pat is certainly portrayed as unstable, but that act is not what makes him so.  The movies seems to be trying to portray Nicki as the victim to Pat, when it's just the opposite. Why is her affair treated as of no consequence?2) What's the deal with Pat whispering something in Nicki's ear at the end that the audience cannot hear and never finds out about?

So I wasn't disappointed by this film because I had low expectations to begin with. Bradly Cooper is one of my favorite actors. I loved his last film, the one that is like a splice between Total Recall and Inception. Jennifer Lawrence, however, I am not crazy about. I didn't find her role in Winter's Bone to be all THAT. It was an ok film. Not shocking, enthralling or mesmorizing at all to me. Obvious, however, yes. She was good in the Hunger Games, but I think its true what they say, &#34;You're only as good as the actor in front of you.&#34; And she had a lot of actors in front of her that day. I know, you could say the same about her role up against Bradly, and you may be right. Sometimes he isn't that great either. But this isn't one of those times.In this role Cooper is just being released from a mental hospital after the nervous breakdown he suffered due to the discovery of his wife's infidelity with one of Cooper's co-workers. On the day of his release, Cooper decides he is going to get his wife back and make things right again by being positive, truthful and compassionate to the needs of others, as he was none of these things in his marriage before the breakdown. He meets Lawrence's character at the dinner party of a longtime friend, whose wife decides to tempt fate by trying to set up her sister (Lawrence) whom is grieving the loss of her husband with Cooper. The dinner is a disaster, both Lawrence and Cooper spend the evening discussing which medications they have been taking. An awkward moment arrives and Cooper has to excuse himself. Lawrence follows in pursuit, hits on Cooper, is denied, slaps him and then exits. It was funny but I also felt their tension, confusion and awkwardness. I have had moments like this. I am bipolar and recently experienced something similar at a dinner party. I hate dinner parties. I hate parties.The problem with this movie is that I thought that was the best part of it. After that, it just tries too hard. Cooper, I thought did a good job though in conveying the hardships of an mental illness when involving relationships. The scene in the attic bedroom when he comes unhinged and the cops are called was meant to be funny Im sure, but to me, it was real. And it was frightening. I've been there.

It first debuted here in Houston during the Cinema Arts Festival earlier this month, but critics, entertainment blogs and magazines, and anyone who's seen the film who has a working mouth and all of their fingers have done nothing but praise this film. Speaking as someone who could care less about what films win awards and what don't, the Oscar campaign revolving around the film is falling on deaf ears. Just focus on being a fantastic film first and let the accolades come to you. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" certainly deserves the praise.Eight months ago, a teacher named Pat (Bradley Cooper) came home to find his wife in the shower with another teacher. Pat lost it, was diagnosed as bipolar, and has spent his time in a mental institution ever since. Now, with permission from the court, his mom (Jacki Weaver) has come to take him out. Even though Pat is in his parents' custody and has a restraining order against him, he believes that he and wife Nikki (Brea Bee) are still very much in love. Pat eventually meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who's also having a rough time since her husband of three years suddenly passed away. Since Tiffany also recently lost her job, Pat begins to realize that the two of them have more in common than he once thought even if they can't stand to be around each other.This is the best Bradley Cooper has ever been. Being one of the few people who's actually a fan of some of his different outings such as ""Limitless"" and ""The Midnight Meat Train,"" it was still surprising how good he was here. Maybe it's because everyone seems to automatically label him with that raunchy, obnoxious, R-rated comedy label whenever you see his face, but you just don't expect to be taken aback by a Bradley Cooper performance. This is Cooper offering a serious spin on being in a mental institution. His outbursts, his devotion to his wife who hasn't shown any sort of reciprocation, and just his display of raw emotion is undeniably superb.In the same breath, you have to recognize Robert De Niro in this as well. When was the last time De Niro cried in a film? Can you recall? Has he ever? He's so emotional here, which seems extremely uncharacteristic of the 69-year-old actor. His yearning to spend time with Pat, his random OCD, and violent past seems to haunt him now more than anything. It's almost as if he constantly wants all of these things he'll never fully be able to grasp. It's a very different turn for De Niro.Even with the strong performances from both Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" wasn't really as great as everyone was making it out to be until Jennifer Lawrence came along. This is the most adult performance of hers so far and she knocks it out of the park. Tiffany seems completely devoid of emotion at first and is very blunt; sometimes says exactly what's on her mind when she probably shouldn't like Pat. But she begins to open up the more the two of them spend time with one another and it's her chemistry with Cooper that makes the film reach such incredible praise. The scene at the diner is just outstanding as is every time Tiffany surprises Pat when he's out jogging.This is the story of extremely flawed individuals that are written so well that they're easy to relate to. Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro give career best performances while Jennifer Lawrence proves that we've only seen a glimmer of what she's truly capable of as a talented actress. Laugh out loud funny at times and gut wrenching at others with just the right amount of bleak material to be intriguing and not overly depressing, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the most genuine and human films of the year.",4,Captures ingenuity in a magnificent way,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,3762,"['Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'had', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'what', 'feels', 'forever', 'first', 'debuted', 'here', 'Houston', 'Cinema', 'Arts', 'Festival', 'earlier', 'month', 'critics', 'entertainment', 'blogs', 'magazines', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'who', 'working', 'mouth', 'fingers', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'praise', 'film', 'Speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'what', 'films', 'win', 'awards', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'campaign', 'revolving', 'film', 'falling', 'deaf', 'ears', 'Just', 'focus', 'being', 'fantastic', 'film', 'first', 'let', 'accolades', 'come', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'certainly', 'praise.Eight', 'months', 'ago', 'teacher', 'named', 'Pat', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'came', 'home', 'find', 'wife', 'shower', 'teacher', 'Pat', 'lost', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'bipolar', 'spent', 'time', 'mental', 'institution', 'ever', 'Now', 'permission', 'court', 'mom', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'come', 'take', 'out', 'Even', 'Pat', 'parents', 'custody', 'restraining', 'order', 'wife', 'Nikki', 'Brea', 'Bee', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'Pat', 'eventually', 'Tiffany', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'also', 'having', 'rough', 'time', 'husband', 'three', 'years', 'suddenly', 'passed', 'away', 'Tiffany', 'also', 'recently', 'lost', 'job', 'Pat', 'realize', 'two', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'once', 'thought', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'be', 'other.This', 'best', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'ever', 'been', 'Being', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'fan', 'different', 'outings', 'such', 'Limitless', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'was', 'still', 'surprising', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'here', 'Maybe', 'everyone', 'automatically', 'label', 'raunchy', 'obnoxious', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'label', 'whenever', 'see', 'face', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'taken', 'aback', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'performance', 'Cooper', 'offering', 'serious', 'spin', 'being', 'mental', 'institution', 'outbursts', 'devotion', 'wife', 'who', ""n't"", 'shown', 'sort', 'reciprocation', 'just', 'display', 'raw', 'emotion', 'undeniably', 'superb.In', 'same', 'breath', 'have', 'recognize', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'De', 'Niro', 'cried', 'film', 'Can', 'recall', 'Has', 'ever', 'so', 'emotional', 'here', 'extremely', 'uncharacteristic', '69-year-old', 'actor', 'yearning', 'spend', 'time', 'Pat', 'random', 'OCD', 'violent', 'past', 'haunt', 'now', 'more', 'anything', 'almost', 'things', ""'ll"", 'never', 'fully', 'be', 'able', 'grasp', 'very', 'different', 'turn', 'De', 'Niro.Even', 'strong', 'performances', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'as', 'great', 'everyone', 'was', 'making', 'be', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'came', 'along', 'most', 'adult', 'performance', 'hers', 'so', 'far', 'park', 'Tiffany', 'completely', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'first', 'very', 'blunt', 'sometimes', 'exactly', 'what', 'mind', 'when', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'like', 'Pat', 'open', 'up', 'more', 'two', 'spend', 'time', 'one', 'chemistry', 'Cooper', 'film', 'reach', 'such', 'incredible', 'praise', 'scene', 'diner', 'just', 'outstanding', 'time', 'Tiffany', 'surprises', 'Pat', 'when', 'out', 'jogging.This', 'story', 'extremely', 'flawed', 'individuals', 'are', 'written', 'so', 'well', ""'re"", 'easy', 'relate', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'give', 'career', 'best', 'performances', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'glimmer', 'what', 'truly', 'capable', 'talented', 'actress', 'loud', 'funny', 'times', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'others', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'bleak', 'material', 'be', 'intriguing', 'not', 'overly', 'depressing', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'one', 'most', 'genuine', 'human', 'films', 'year']",Silver Linings Playbook

1572365,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B008OGIPJA,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 4]","Director David O. Russell (Three Kings) has taken Matthew Quick's novel, Silver Linings Playbook, and adapted it for the screen.  It is a topic near and dear to him as his own son has bipolar disorder like the lead character.  By balancing dramatic situations with comedic overtones, Russell has accomplished a rare feat, an excellent drama with a superior cast that treads the fine line of humor.  By making such a delicate subject accessible to the masses, he has made a really entertaining, crowd pleaser.Pat (Bradley Cooper) suffers from bipolar disorder and, following a breakdown over a failed marriage and confinement to a psychiatric facility in Baltimore, has just been released to his parents' care.  Now back in Philadelphia and living with his parents, Dolores (Jacki Weaver), his doting mother, and Pat, Sr. (Robert DeNiro), a sports addict, Pat is determined to get his wife back despite a restraining order.  He is so obsessed with getting back with his wife that he boils over on occasion with emotional outbursts which threaten to send him back to confinement.  When he is not taking his meds or visiting his therapist, he runs in his neighborhood to get into shape in anticipation of repatriating with his wife, or so he thinks.  One day he runs into Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), another troubled soul who not only has been widowed recently, but now sleeps with anyone.  Their uneasy interactions lead to an unusual offer by Tiffany for him to partner with her in a dance contest in exchange for her being an intermediary and backdoor link to his wife.  What follows are the revelations of emotional scars and the realities of finding happiness in the most unlikely places.The cast is excellent, particularly the four lead actors.  Lawrence portrays Tiffany as a seemingly nave, young woman, but she turns out to be a bright, perceptive person who is not afraid to stand toe-to-toe with anyone.  DeNiro has not had such a strong role in many years, and he shows just how good he still is.  Even Chris Tucker, in an unusual supporting role, registers as Pat's buddy from his psych group.The film is about how people, who are trapped in their own patterns of behavior, are afraid or unable to reach out and take a chance in life.  The depictions of mental illness are portrayed with realism.  When Pat undergoes mood swings, it can manifest itself as uncontrollable rage brought on by a simple trigger.  He has no filter to his reactions and responses which can be quite awkward and downright offensive.  Much as Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as It Gets laments if `this really is as good as it gets', Cooper's Pat tries to find the `silver lining' in his life.It is interesting to note that virtually every major character in the story has emotional issues in varying degrees.  At one point Pat actually thinks Tiffany is crazier than he is.  Pat's father, a superstitious gambler and bookie, has his own issues with obsessive-compulsive disorder. His belief that having his son nearby to ensure the Eagles football team a victory, leads to an amusing confrontation with Tiffany.When you have a cast that is this good, you have to look at the director, Russell, who orchestrates like a master conductor.  Despite an uneven filmography in his early career, he is rapidly becoming the actors' go-to director.  His attention to minor details like the simple act of tying a tie, a quick reaction shot, or hand gesture enriches the texture of a characterization.  His recent films (The Fighter) have taken noteworthy, acting ensembles and elicited superior, Oscar worthy performances amid strong storylines.  Somewhere, directing legends, George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story) and William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives), are smiling broadly.",5,The Game of Life in SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,3766,"['Director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'Three', 'Kings', 'taken', 'Matthew', 'Quick', 'novel', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'adapted', 'screen', 'topic', 'dear', 'own', 'son', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'lead', 'character', 'balancing', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'comedic', 'overtones', 'Russell', 'accomplished', 'rare', 'feat', 'excellent', 'drama', 'superior', 'cast', 'fine', 'line', 'humor', 'making', 'such', 'delicate', 'subject', 'accessible', 'masses', 'made', 'really', 'entertaining', 'crowd', 'pleaser.Pat', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'suffers', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'following', 'breakdown', 'failed', 'marriage', 'confinement', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'Baltimore', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'parents', 'care', 'Now', 'back', 'Philadelphia', 'living', 'parents', 'Dolores', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'doting', 'mother', 'Pat', 'Sr.', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'sports', 'addict', 'Pat', 'determined', 'get', 'wife', 'back', 'restraining', 'order', 'so', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'back', 'wife', 'occasion', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'threaten', 'send', 'back', 'confinement', 'When', 'not', 'taking', 'meds', 'visiting', 'therapist', 'neighborhood', 'get', 'shape', 'anticipation', 'repatriating', 'wife', 'so', 'One', 'day', 'Tiffany', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'troubled', 'soul', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'been', 'widowed', 'recently', 'now', 'anyone', 'uneasy', 'interactions', 'lead', 'unusual', 'offer', 'Tiffany', 'partner', 'dance', 'contest', 'exchange', 'being', 'intermediary', 'backdoor', 'link', 'wife', 'What', 'are', 'revelations', 'emotional', 'scars', 'realities', 'finding', 'happiness', 'most', 'unlikely', 'places.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'four', 'lead', 'actors', 'Lawrence', 'Tiffany', 'seemingly', 'nave', 'young', 'woman', 'out', 'be', 'bright', 'perceptive', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'stand', 'toe-to-toe', 'anyone', 'DeNiro', 'not', 'had', 'strong', 'role', 'many', 'years', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'still', 'Even', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'unusual', 'supporting', 'role', 'registers', 'Pat', 'buddy', 'psych', 'group.The', 'film', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trapped', 'own', 'patterns', 'behavior', 'are', 'afraid', 'unable', 'reach', 'out', 'take', 'chance', 'life', 'depictions', 'mental', 'illness', 'are', 'portrayed', 'realism', 'When', 'Pat', 'mood', 'swings', 'can', 'manifest', 'uncontrollable', 'rage', 'brought', 'simple', 'trigger', 'filter', 'reactions', 'responses', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'awkward', 'downright', 'offensive', 'Much', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'As', 'Good', 'laments', 'really', 'as', 'good', 'Cooper', 'Pat', 'find', 'silver', 'lining', 'life.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'virtually', 'major', 'character', 'story', 'emotional', 'issues', 'varying', 'degrees', 'one', 'point', 'Pat', 'actually', 'Tiffany', 'crazier', 'Pat', 'father', 'superstitious', 'gambler', 'bookie', 'own', 'issues', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'belief', 'having', 'son', 'nearby', 'ensure', 'Eagles', 'football', 'team', 'victory', 'amusing', 'confrontation', 'Tiffany.When', 'have', 'cast', 'good', 'have', 'look', 'director', 'Russell', 'who', 'master', 'conductor', 'uneven', 'filmography', 'early', 'career', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'actors', 'go-to', 'director', 'attention', 'minor', 'details', 'simple', 'act', 'tying', 'tie', 'quick', 'reaction', 'shot', 'hand', 'gesture', 'texture', 'characterization', 'recent', 'films', 'Fighter', 'have', 'taken', 'noteworthy', 'acting', 'ensembles', 'elicited', 'superior', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performances', 'strong', 'storylines', 'Somewhere', 'directing', 'legends', 'George', 'Cukor', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'are', 'smiling', 'broadly']",Silver Linings Playbook

Well lesson learned. After ravings and ravings about the amazing Silver Linings Playbook movie from critics and people I was excited to see this movie, I was gonna see it anyway because I loved the book, and come on this was an amazing cast, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert, this is a dream cast. Boy was I super duper disappointed! How in the world this movie got all these awards beats me, well I think because this was such an amazing cast everyone makes themselves or wants themselves to like this movie, cause that's the only reason I can think of. As badly as I wanted to believe the hype and make myself like it because the cast was amazing, I could not lie to myself. It was an utter disappointment. Of course I have a bunch of people telling me I'm wrong just because this movie has a dream cast everyone says it's amazing but they don't explain why it's amazing. Well why do I dislike it? Well the acting would be one of the many problems with this movie, Jennifer's acting in this movie was way over rated. Of course I get comments like ""your just a hater"" well let me tell you that I'm not because I loved her in the hunger games, she carried that film, so no I'm not a hater. Robert was also a disappointment, he just didn't bring his A game into this film. Another problem with this film is that it's one thing for this to be a book but it's another thing to make this into a movie, a comedy movie. I see nothing funny with making fun of illness. Another problem is that for me this movie had to do with more football and dancing then what the book was about and that was also a very huge disappointment, I'm going to get more comments from people who already have an opinion on this movie telling me that I'm wrong or I didn't explain something correctly so therefore I'm wrong about the whole thing or my opinion sucks or I'm boring just because I dislike this movie and blah, blah, blah! It's just annoying, it seems that people forget that this is just my opinion, MY POINT OF VIEW on this movie. I guess they have nothing better to do then to just go on all the 1 star reviews and tell us how wrong we are. But if I can at least stop one person from seeing this movie then I'd done my job. But hey I'm just as upset because this was such an amazing cast, wasted on a movie that turned out to be horrible. I almost walked out on this movie, but I stayed hoping it would get better as the book did but it just didn't. This movie had very few laughs. The movie was just very dull to me. The script was a mess. I also wasn't fine with the fact how they changed some scenes in the movie. Yes I understand it's a movie and they have to do that.

This is by no means a bad movie. In fact there are some great ideas and a even a half-decent portrayal of Bipolar Disorder and OCD, which by the way were more consistent with public perception than the actual presentation of these disorders. The story moves well, has enough depth to hold ones attention, and the two very attractive main characters helped. At the end however, the story felt to me as though it fell short of amazing, and just ended up another 21st century &#34;i'm kinda screwed up, but hey so is everyone else, and oh yey love!&#34;, which is nauseatingly common in today's romantic comedies.Worth a watch though...",3,Whats all the hype about?,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,744,"['had', 'lot', 'hopes', 'going', 'movie', 'found', 'mildly', 'annoyed', 'time', 'credits', 'rolled', 'bad', 'movie', 'fact', 'are', 'great', 'ideas', 'even', 'half-decent', 'portrayal', 'Bipolar', 'Disorder', 'OCD', 'way', 'were', 'more', 'consistent', 'public', 'perception', 'actual', 'presentation', 'disorders', 'story', 'moves', 'well', 'enough', 'depth', 'hold', 'ones', 'attention', 'two', 'very', 'attractive', 'main', 'characters', 'helped', 'end', 'however', 'story', 'felt', 'fell', 'short', 'amazing', 'just', 'ended', 'up', '21st', 'century', '34', 'i', ""'m"", 'kinda', 'screwed', 'up', 'hey', 'so', 'everyone', 'else', 'oh', 'yey', 'love', '34', 'nauseatingly', 'common', 'today', 'romantic', 'comedies.Worth', 'watch']",Silver Linings Playbook

1572373,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B008OGIPJA,DanD,"[2, 3]","Meet Pat.  His mother has just bailed him out of a psychiatric hospital, against the doctor's advice.  Pat has been institutionalized because he caught his wife, Nikki, with another man.  And then proceded to beat that man near to death.  Once out, Pat's friend's wife Veronica tries to set him up with Tiffany, an equally-troubled widow who uses dance to cope with her demons.  Figuring he could be charitable, while at the same time convince Nikki to drop the restraining order, Pat decides to help Tiffany with her dance competition, all the while trying to satisfy his father's belief that Pat is the key to a Philadelphia Eagles victory of the Cowboys.When you get right down to it, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a romantic comedy.  It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and it's not even that romantic, yet that's exactly what the film is.  It's a bit predictable, too, despite writer/director David O. Russell's best efforts.  His previous film, THE FIGHTER, was also a genre piece that more or less stuck to conventions; that film was a superior outing, perhaps due to its grittier subject matter.  PLAYBOOK does try to dig beneath the skin; this is most visible in the scenes between leads Bradley Cooper (who would have won the Oscar if Daniel Day-Lewis hadn't been nominated), and Jennifer Lawrence (who did win the Oscar, even if she deserved it more two years ago for A WINTER'S BONE).  The actors are game for the material; the script starts out strong, bogs down in the middle, then picks up again for a beautifully unconventional dance number (I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen), and throughout the film, these two actors give it their all.  Anyone who only knows Cooper from THE HANGOVER should take note, and anyone who identifies Jennifer Lawrence solely with THE HUNGER GAMES should pull themselves out of puberty for a minute.  (Okay, that's unfair.  The book was actually pretty grown up.)Cooper and Lawrence aren't the only two here, however.  Jacki Weaver, as Pat's mom, is a subtle wonder (and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, for what it's worth); she doesn't do much, but what she does is terrific.  Julia Stiles is great in her limited role, as is (surprisingly) Chris Tucker.  Shea Wigham continues to get work as Pat's brother; one of these days, he'll be a leading man in his own right, but for now it's nice to see him wherever he pops up.  The true wonder among the supporting cast, however, is Robert De Niro, nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  De Niro isn't as good as he was in his heyday, but this is the best he's been in a long time, and his character is one of the more interesting ones in the film.  His relationship with Pat isn't explored as thoroughly as it should've been, and that is one of the film's many flaws.  SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK aims high; as such, when it falls flat, one can't help but notice.  But what's here is worth watching, if only for the caliber of performances features.  It may not be a whole lot more than an actor's piece...but hey, there are worse things in the world.

1572376,A3QU74B9N0830G,B008OGIPJA,Dan Thompson,"[2, 4]","Coming off the success of his previous film, the brilliant and superbly acted ""The Fighter"", David O. Russell brings us a story dealing with family issues, personal struggle, and the quest for happiness. The movie revolves around Bradley Cooper's character Pat, a man who lost everything due to an incident that landed him in a mental institution. When Pat gets out, he's determined to get his life back together while seeking out the silver lining in every situation. He meets Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, who has problems of her own but agrees to help Pat reconnect with his wife.The film walks a difficult tightrope, blending comedy and romance with the serious issues of mental health and family struggle. Russell does a great job of accomplishing this by staying sensitive to the material and knowing when to throw in some subtle humor. In fact, you could classify this film as a romantic comedy, albeit much smarter and sensitive than is typically seen.Cooper continues to prove that he's more than just a pretty face, and is absolutely terrific here. There's a plethora of emotions felt by his character throughout the film and the actor is more than up to the challenge of portraying each one with sincerity. Equally impressive is Jennifer Lawrence, who's funny, sexy, intense, and mysterious, usually all at the same time. The chemistry between the two is very believable and there's some great dialogue between them throughout the movie. Another impressive performance comes from Robert DeNiro, who plays Pat's neurotic father with a Philadelphia Eagles obsession. Finally, the surprise of the film has to be Chris Tucker, who has been nearly non-existent for the past few years but gives a heartfelt and sincere performance.This is a terrific film and one that is more than deserving of any awards it may win. It's a good lesson on looking at things differently and seeking out our own silver linings.",5,"Heartfelt, Funny, & Highly Recommended",1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,1921,"['Coming', 'off', 'success', 'previous', 'film', 'brilliant', 'superbly', 'acted', 'Fighter', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'story', 'dealing', 'family', 'issues', 'personal', 'struggle', 'quest', 'happiness', 'movie', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'character', 'Pat', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'due', 'incident', 'landed', 'mental', 'institution', 'When', 'Pat', 'out', 'determined', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'seeking', 'out', 'silver', 'lining', 'situation', 'Tiffany', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'problems', 'own', 'help', 'Pat', 'reconnect', 'wife.The', 'film', 'walks', 'difficult', 'tightrope', 'blending', 'comedy', 'romance', 'serious', 'issues', 'mental', 'health', 'family', 'struggle', 'Russell', 'great', 'job', 'accomplishing', 'staying', 'sensitive', 'material', 'knowing', 'when', 'throw', 'subtle', 'humor', 'fact', 'could', 'classify', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'albeit', 'much', 'smarter', 'sensitive', 'typically', 'seen.Cooper', 'prove', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'here', 'plethora', 'emotions', 'felt', 'character', 'film', 'actor', 'more', 'up', 'challenge', 'portraying', 'one', 'sincerity', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'funny', 'sexy', 'intense', 'mysterious', 'usually', 'same', 'time', 'chemistry', 'two', 'very', 'believable', 'great', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'impressive', 'performance', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'who', 'Pat', 'neurotic', 'father', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'obsession', 'Finally', 'surprise', 'film', 'be', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'who', 'been', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'heartfelt', 'sincere', 'performance.This', 'terrific', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'deserving', 'awards', 'may', 'win', 'good', 'lesson', 'looking', 'things', 'differently', 'seeking', 'out', 'own', 'silver', 'linings']",Silver Linings Playbook
1572377,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B008OGIPJA,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[10, 19]","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a grating, occasionally endearing and humorous portrait of a bipolar misfit attempting to create a livable life after his release from a court-mandated stay in a mental institution. Pat (Bradley Cooper) chases his wife, unseen for most of the film. She has a fulltime job as a high school English teacher. Pat has no job and lives in his parents' attic. His parents, Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver (whom I thought was Sally Struthers) are themselves no prize winners. Dad is an obsessive compulsive football fan and gambler who insists that his son Pat must sit next to him during games while holding a green handkerchief in order for his team, the Philadelphia Eagles, to win. Mom cooks and whines a lot.Pat meets Tiffany, a very, very hot young widow. She falls in love with him at first sight, but he resists her, because he wants to get back with his wife.The best reason to see this film is Bradley Cooper's performance. He is terrific as a man with limited cards playing them the best way he knows how, given his limited awareness, abilities and options. Your heart aches for him. He often behaves in outrageous, indeed, illegal ways, but his insanity is an expression of real sanity in a couple of scenes. He vehemently rejects Ernest Hemingway's decisions in ""Farewell to Arms"" and he rescues his brother from racist thugs.The movie as a whole failed to take flight for me. I found the main characters to be too grating, and I needed a respite or an artistic intervention that would make their qualities more bearable. There was an opportunity for that. Tiffany is a dancer, and she and Pat train to compete in a dance contest. After lengthy, detailed scenes of ugly, irrational and loud familial manipulations, false hope, and dysfunction, I could have used some well-presented music and dance. The director doesn't take advantage of that, though, and the film just squats there, annoying the audience. The film's end is less a resolution and more of a ""we're out of time here so let's wrap things up.""Jennifer Lawrence is spectacularly beautiful, and very young. She's fifteen years younger than Cooper and far too young to be convincing as a grieving widow. She is costumed in skintight leggings and bratops that emphasize her long, slim legs and considerable frontal and posterior assets. Her skin is flawless.I could did not, for one second, believe this vision of health and loveliness to be a desperate, medicated, marginal, screwed up, nymphomaniac widow. I believed her to be exactly what she was - eye candy positioned to keep male viewers' eyes on the screen, no less than a playboy bunny or a cheerleader. A woman closer to Cooper's age, a woman who shows the knocks that life can leave on a person (as scruffy Cooper does) would have been more believable but less commercial. Given the very commercial choice to go with a gorgeous young woman and to parade her assets in every scene, the movie seemed less true, less daring than it thinks of itself as being.",3,"Cooper Outacts DeNiro in Grating, Sometimes Endearing Film",1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,3008,"['Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'grating', 'occasionally', 'endearing', 'humorous', 'portrait', 'bipolar', 'misfit', 'attempting', 'create', 'livable', 'life', 'release', 'court-mandated', 'stay', 'mental', 'institution', 'Pat', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'wife', 'unseen', 'most', 'film', 'fulltime', 'job', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'Pat', 'job', 'parents', 'attic', 'parents', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'whom', 'thought', 'was', 'Sally', 'Struthers', 'are', 'prize', 'winners', 'Dad', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'football', 'fan', 'gambler', 'who', 'son', 'Pat', 'must', 'sit', 'next', 'games', 'holding', 'green', 'handkerchief', 'order', 'team', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'win', 'Mom', 'cooks', 'lot.Pat', 'meets', 'Tiffany', 'very', 'very', 'hot', 'young', 'widow', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'get', 'back', 'wife.The', 'best', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'performance', 'terrific', 'man', 'limited', 'cards', 'playing', 'best', 'way', 'how', 'given', 'limited', 'awareness', 'abilities', 'options', 'heart', 'aches', 'often', 'outrageous', 'indeed', 'illegal', 'ways', 'insanity', 'expression', 'real', 'sanity', 'couple', 'scenes', 'vehemently', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'decisions', 'Farewell', 'Arms', 'brother', 'racist', 'thugs.The', 'movie', 'whole', 'failed', 'take', 'flight', 'found', 'main', 'characters', 'be', 'too', 'grating', 'needed', 'respite', 'artistic', 'intervention', 'would', 'make', 'qualities', 'more', 'bearable', 'was', 'opportunity', 'Tiffany', 'dancer', 'Pat', 'train', 'compete', 'dance', 'contest', 'lengthy', 'detailed', 'scenes', 'ugly', 'irrational', 'loud', 'familial', 'manipulations', 'false', 'hope', 'dysfunction', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'well-presented', 'music', 'dance', 'director', ""n't"", 'take', 'advantage', 'though', 'film', 'just', 'squats', 'there', 'annoying', 'audience', 'film', 'end', 'less', 'resolution', 'more', ""'re"", 'time', 'here', 'so', 'let', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'spectacularly', 'beautiful', 'very', 'young', 'fifteen', 'years', 'younger', 'Cooper', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'convincing', 'grieving', 'widow', 'costumed', 'skintight', 'leggings', 'bratops', 'emphasize', 'long', 'slim', 'legs', 'considerable', 'frontal', 'posterior', 'assets', 'skin', 'flawless.I', 'could', 'did', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'believe', 'vision', 'health', 'loveliness', 'be', 'desperate', 'medicated', 'marginal', 'screwed', 'up', 'nymphomaniac', 'widow', 'believed', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'eye', 'candy', 'positioned', 'keep', 'male', 'viewers', 'eyes', 'screen', 'less', 'playboy', 'bunny', 'cheerleader', 'woman', 'closer', 'Cooper', 'age', 'woman', 'who', 'knocks', 'life', 'can', 'leave', 'person', 'scruffy', 'Cooper', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'less', 'commercial', 'Given', 'very', 'commercial', 'choice', 'go', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'woman', 'parade', 'assets', 'scene', 'movie', 'seemed', 'less', 'true', 'less', 'daring', 'being']",Silver Linings Playbook

The story is principally about Pat, an unstable bipolar man released from a mental hospital where he spent eight months in lieu prison time.

Through guilt trips, lies, trickery and insensitivity, his family and friends create an almost impossible return to reality for poor Pat.  While there were a few comical lines and scenes, I was annoyed by the film more than entertained, perhaps because I have a family member who was diagnosed as bipolar and his reactions to life's normal events are not a potential subject for a romantic comedy.  The film could have been a drama if treated more seriously.  Conversely, it could have been a black comedy exploring the absurdities of bipolar behavior.

The film seemed to be more of a quirky romantic comedy with not a lot of substance. My initial opinion changed when I saw the film.  What changed my mind were the very strong performances.There was an immediate connection with Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), recently diagnosed as a bipolar person, who has lost everything (his house, his job and his wife) been in a state institution for eight months and is now living with his parents (magnificently played by Jacki Weaver and Robert DeNiro).  Pat, however, is optimistic, looking for a silver lining to his problems, that he can rebuild his life and reunite with his wife, in spite of her infidelity that sparked everything.

Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife but he must do something for her in return &#8211; enter a dance competition.  It is a joy to watch as Pat and Tiffany begin to trust each other and slowly fall in love. The film is an honest portrayal of mental illness with very strong performances by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. One only has to watch the scene when the couple goes out to dinner for the first time to gauge the excellence of their performances.  The goal of acting is to convince the audience that you are not watching a performance.  The actors are their characters down to every detail.

Secondly it's about two bent but not broken hearts who are desperately right for one another and the awkward path they take in coming to that realization.  Mental illness is a tricky theme to portray but writer-director David O. Russell in conjunction with his main actors, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, pull it off beautifully with sensitivity and great wit and insight.  Cooper and Lawrence should be applauded for getting the tone right for their characters and not overplaying it.  We forget we are watching actors giving a performance but people like us trying to cope with the slings and arrows that burden us.  Last year was a terrific year for American film.

And for all of us part of growing up is figuring out how to deal with this lack of perfection, this fact that life will never be or feel perfect. (So throwing the Hemingway novel out the window was awesome, a way of recognizing that even in art life is not perfect----Melville has a line ""the truth comes in with darkness""). For me, the Bradley Cooper character just suffers from an extreme version of this shared human malady. And so we all kind of recognize ourselves in that character. So for me this particular mental illness (theatrical as it is) is a convenient way to visualize a common human failing. And to outwardly reveal just how destructive unrealistic expectations/unrealized dreams can be (those things we usually keep hidden away). The director is dealing with pretty dark and disappointing truths here but in a way that allows us to both connect to Bradley and let go of our own unrealistic expectations (or whatever it is that is spoiling life for us) as he does. And the comedy is part of that healing. (The other great scene in the movie is the crotch face plant---an example of something going wrong but this time being perceived as being kind of perfect anyway. ""Yeah we got a 5"").So many Hollywood movies are about chasing larger than life dreams but this film is a nice earthy corrective to that blatant disregard for realism and how real people really cope.",5,The Question of Mental Illness in Silver Linings Playbook,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,1630,"['question', 'mental', 'illness', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'mental', 'illness', 'worked', 'was', 'not', 'exploitative', 'was', 'kind', 'mental', 'illness', 'suffer', 'degree', 'desire', 'perfection', 'love', 'life', 'part', 'growing', 'up', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'deal', 'lack', 'perfection', 'fact', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'feel', 'perfect', 'throwing', 'Hemingway', 'novel', 'window', 'was', 'awesome', 'way', 'recognizing', 'even', 'art', 'life', 'not', 'perfect', 'Melville', 'line', 'truth', 'darkness', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'character', 'just', 'suffers', 'extreme', 'version', 'shared', 'human', 'malady', 'kind', 'recognize', 'ourselves', 'character', 'So', 'particular', 'mental', 'illness', 'theatrical', 'convenient', 'way', 'visualize', 'common', 'human', 'failing', 'outwardly', 'reveal', 'just', 'how', 'destructive', 'unrealistic', 'expectations/unrealized', 'dreams', 'can', 'be', 'things', 'usually', 'keep', 'hidden', 'away', 'director', 'dealing', 'pretty', 'dark', 'disappointing', 'truths', 'here', 'way', 'connect', 'Bradley', 'let', 'go', 'own', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'whatever', 'spoiling', 'life', 'comedy', 'part', 'healing', 'other', 'great', 'scene', 'movie', 'crotch', 'face', 'plant', '-an', 'example', 'something', 'going', 'wrong', 'time', 'being', 'perceived', 'being', 'kind', 'perfect', 'anyway', 'got', '5', '.So', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'are', 'chasing', 'larger', 'life', 'dreams', 'film', 'nice', 'earthy', 'corrective', 'blatant', 'disregard', 'realism', 'how', 'real', 'people', 'really', 'cope']",Silver Linings Playbook

As a drama about mental illness, it falls short because it tries too hard to be funny, and the lead characters are such stereotypical bipolars. In either case, the scenes of violence are horribly fake. As a kind of funny-serious social satire on how everyone, along with the society they create and inhabit, is nuts, this film works VERY well, even if it does take some time to develop.The first half drags and is a bit unfocused; moreover, it seems overwrought with acting, script, and directions that try a bit too hard to portray crazy people. I found it very frustrating but soon discovered that it provided good set-up for the second half. There is also some nice and subtle foreshadowing here regarding the craziness of Pat (Cooper)'s family and all the other supposedly normal people in the film. While Jennifer Lawrence (as Tiffany) over-acts--just as Cooper does-- it helps to elucidate the less stereotypical side of her in the second half. Her script--see the line I've used as my title--and entire character contribute a great deal to this film. The second half is also sometimes repetitive and unfocused, but the whole theme really shines through, and it could not end any better. Tiffany and Pat's dance scene is riveting (and I'll admit, pretty funny).In the end, it's fitting that a film about craziness follows such a crazy structure.*Many obviously disagree with me on whether or not this film is truly funny.

In an effort not to be redundant or repetitive about just how brilliant this film is I will take a slightly different angle in its analysis. For starters, the acting is stellar and right on point with depicting the struggles of living with bipolar and manic depression. The main characters (brilliantly played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) are forced to confront their demons and all the while learn from each other about coping with ups and downs. Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from a state institution, as part of a plea bargain after violently assaulting a man in the throws with his wife. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is a young widow who suffers with the very same condition he deals with. Medicines have not worked well for either of them. Their inner anguish is badly stigmatized by those around them and their erratic behavior badly impairs their social lives and connection with the world around them. Still, their insight and inability to filter (in the words of Pat) provide them with a rare insight into the world that others do not have. Some may call it insight. I call it a badly broken kind of brilliance. Pat's mantra is ""excelsior."" This fuels his wish to find the silver lining in every situation in his life - good or bad.In spite of the restraining order that Pat's wife has against him, he wishes to give a letter to her anyway. Tiffany will deliver the letter on the condition that he practice and be part of a dance competition with her as her partner. This arrangement paves the way to an interesting series of developments. Not planning to give away any more plot details beyond this. If you want more, simply read the other reviews. I do want to state that I appreciate the frank depiction and sensitivity that mental illness is portrayed in this film. It is not easy to watch the painful outbursts and anguish that the characters go through. Yet, the actors do such a brilliant and sensitive job with their roles that you are left with great insight into the mind and conflicts behind mania, manic depression, bipolar and emotional pain.

Russell has lost the courage of his convictions.  The premise is an original one: Bradley Cooper's bipolar life-wrecker Pat has to come to terms with living in the community once more after eight months incarceration, and teams up - chiefly due to his mother's machinations - with Jennifer Lawrence's equally disturbed widow Tiffany.  The two of them have a stormy relationship which goes through fits and starts until they start rehearsing for a dance competition.  The camerawork at the beginning is excellent, with the use of a handheld camera coming uncomfortably close to the actors' faces to signify how Pat and Tiffany's mood-shifts can have destructive effects on those around them.  As the film unfolds, however, so the study of bipolar disorder gets lost, and we are plunged instead into a romcom that culminates on the dance-floor, rather in the manner of Baz Luhrmann's STRICTLY BALLROOM from the Nineties.  The end is predictable.  Director Russell also wastes the opportunity to explore the relationship between Pat and his father (Robert de Niro), an equally obsessive addict of the Philadelphia Eagles.  One wonders whether the father's OCD did not impinge upon his son, but the connection is not taken up.

Being bipolar or having clinical depression puts one far more in contact with our existence. As belief in organized religions or using forms of denial by identifying with ""the norm"" can isolate us from the truth -- and ease our adjustment.As a psychologist, this depiction of bipolar illness is the most accurate and nuanced version which I have ever seen. Pat and Tiffany both suffer from this DSM diagnostic category. These mood disorders are closely related to obsessive compulsive disorder, sleep problems, eating disorder, borderline and other personality disorders... So, Pat's father [Pat, Sr.] clearly has obsessive compulsive disorder and, consequently many superstitions which interfere with his functioning. Since genetics are involved -- why not?These themes are not new to me -- however, it is the execution of Silver Linings Playbook by director Russell and the engaging cast, the cinemaphotography. original and selected music that makes this film so outstanding. Add The two most prominent characters and Robert de Nero... Who is possibly the most ""crazy"" --  simply because he does not acknowledge his obsessive problem.Someone said that this is a comedy. Yes and no! It is quite serious dealing with tragic existential problems... But, is not comedy often the other side of tragedy?Yes, Silver Linings Playbook does deal with the great magnitude of suffering which both Pat and Tiffany have to deal with -- however this work presents it in an aesthetically pleasing and often delightful manner.Silver Linings Playbook",5,SLP: SIMPLY THE BEST FILM ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS -- EVER!,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,2080,"['Two', 'most', 'prominent', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'people', 'diagnosed', 'mental', 'illnesses', 'actually', 'are', 'fully', 'touch', 'reality', 'problems', 'flow', 'understanding', 'especially', 'bipolar', 'other', 'mood', 'disorders', 'people', 'have', 'deal', 'life', 'given', 'Then', 'universal', 'conundrum', 'being', 'afraid', 'be', 'love', 'hence', 'commitment', 'vulnerable', 'Normal', 'folks', 'can', 'adjust', 'far', 'more', 'easily', 'successfully', 'use', 'denial', 'circumvent', 'tragic', 'realities', 'life', 'have', 'face', 'Being', 'bipolar', 'having', 'clinical', 'depression', 'one', 'far', 'more', 'contact', 'existence', 'belief', 'organized', 'religions', 'using', 'forms', 'denial', 'identifying', 'norm', 'can', 'isolate', 'truth', 'ease', 'adjustment.As', 'psychologist', 'depiction', 'bipolar', 'illness', 'most', 'accurate', 'nuanced', 'version', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'suffer', 'DSM', 'diagnostic', 'category', 'mood', 'disorders', 'are', 'closely', 'related', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'disorder', 'sleep', 'problems', 'eating', 'disorder', 'borderline', 'other', 'personality', 'disorders', 'So', 'Pat', 'father', '[', 'Pat', 'Sr.', ']', 'clearly', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'disorder', 'consequently', 'many', 'superstitions', 'interfere', 'functioning', 'genetics', 'are', 'involved', 'why', 'not', 'themes', 'are', 'not', 'new', 'however', 'execution', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'director', 'Russell', 'engaging', 'cast', 'cinemaphotography', 'original', 'selected', 'music', 'film', 'so', 'outstanding', 'Add', 'two', 'most', 'prominent', 'characters', 'Robert', 'de', 'Nero', 'Who', 'possibly', 'most', 'crazy', 'simply', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'obsessive', 'problem.Someone', 'said', 'comedy', 'Yes', 'quite', 'serious', 'dealing', 'tragic', 'existential', 'problems', 'not', 'comedy', 'often', 'other', 'side', 'tragedy', 'Yes', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'deal', 'great', 'magnitude', 'suffering', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'have', 'deal', 'however', 'work', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'often', 'delightful', 'manner.Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook']",Silver Linings Playbook

It gives us hope that no matter how rotten and screwed-up our lives become, we can still find our soulmate.And ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is an example of this sort of movie at its best -- a heartbreaking, heartwarming little story about romance, family, football and mental illness. Director David O. Russell is in absolutely brilliant shape her, and he spins up deeply flawed characters who are nevertheless lovable and charming. Also, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are simply stunning as a pair of lost souls who connect over dancing and football.For eight months, Pat Solitano Jr. (Cooper) has been in a mental health facility in Baltimore, being treated for bipolar disorder. Why? Because he went postal and beat his wife Nikki's lover, losing his home, job and marriage in one fell swoop. Now Nikki has a restraining order on Pat, but he's still convinced that she's going to welcome him back once he gets himself back together with exercise and classic literature.He's released into the custody of his parents, and quickly learns that his dad Pat Sr. (Robert de Niro) is now a bookie, and insists that his son is a good luck charm for the Philadelphia Eagles. And when his friend Ronnie invites him to dinner, he meets Ronnie's sister-in-law Tiffany (Lawrence), a blunt young widow with her own personal demons (and more than a hint of sex addiction).Tiffany offers to help Pat contact Nikki via a letter, if he is her partner for an upcoming dance competition. But after the Eagles lose a game -- and Pat Sr. is about to lose his dream of opening a restaurant -- Tiffany and Pat become embroiled in a double-layered bet. But will their growing feelings for each other end up derailing everything?""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a movie that wears both sadness and happiness on its sleeve -- the characters have so much to struggle with, and so many obstacles to overcome. it just breaks your heart to see Pat's delusional belief that Nikki is just waiting for him. It hurts. And yet at the same time, the slow-blooming, almost imperceptible romance between Pat and Tiffany charms you into hoping for... if not a happy ending, then at least a happy new beginning.David O. Russell mixes together the right proportions of comedy, tragedy and romance, with lots of snappy dialogue (""You let me lie to you for a WEEK?"" ""I was trying to be romantic"") and quirky stuff (Pat Sr.'s superstitions). And he films the entire movie in a gritty, realistic style that you don't find in many romantic comedy movies, which only highlights the raw emotions that his actors are putting out.Russell's crowning achievement is the dance competition, when everything -- both personally and financially -- is laid on the line. Not only is it beautifully choreographed (complete with a a rock'n'roll interlude with ""Fell in Love With A Girl""), but it's supercharged with emotion.And the actors are in brilliant shape here. I've never been a fan of Cooper, but his heartfelt depiction of an optimistic, erratic man who has lost everything just swept me away. And Lawrence shows her artistic chops by playing the kind of role that many actresses twice her age could never manage -- a blunt young woman who hides all her pain until she's faced with losing love all over again. They have kinetic, dynamic chemistry that leaves you screaming for them to get together.""Silver Linings Playbook"" is that rare dramedy that really tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you characters that are both heartfelt and quirky.

Russell (The Fighter) deals with the edges of emotional disequilibrium in this compellingly quirky 2012 dramedy. Based on thesame-name 2008 novelby Matthew Quick, this film reminds me a bit of Russell's 1999 dysfunctional family comedy,Flirting With Disaster, as the seriocomically volatile dynamics here are amplified by the central character's precarious psychological state. High school teacher Pat Solitano Jr. is a man with bipolar disorder who has spent eight months in a Baltimore psychiatric hospital for a violent episode caused by seeing his wife Nikki cheating with a fellow teacher. He's released into the care of his parents and determined to win back his estranged wife.As he strives to improve himself, Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell facing her own level of mental instability since becoming widowed, turning to indiscriminate sex with her co-workers, and most recently losing her job. Eventually they strike a deal where she will help him win back his wife if he enters a dance competition with her, both coping with their disorders at the same time. At first, I really didn't buy Bradley Cooper (The Hangover) as Solitano since his idea of showing manically obsessive behavior is to speak loudly in a monotone without much nuance, but his performance grew on me as Russell's screenplay had him show more layers to a character that has a hard time eliciting sympathy from anyone much less the audience. At 21, Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) would appear too young to play a sex-addicted cop widow like Tiffany, but she excels with her preternatural ability to convey unforced maturity and conviction without losing touch with the character's deep-seeded vulnerability.Perhaps the film's nicest surprise is Robert De Niro's sterling performance as Pat Sr., his best work in years after the silly shenanigans of his Ben Stiller partnerships. Exhibiting his character's obsessive-compulsive disorder in powerful, brief scenes, De Niro vividly shows how the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. Completely submerging her Australian roots in favor of a convincing Mid-Atlantic accent, Jacki Weaver (Animal Kingdom) effectively plays the lone voice of sanity as Pat's mother constantly fretting over her son and preparing ""crabby snacks and homemades"" for home viewing of the family's beloved Philadelphia Eagles.  As Pat's best friend Danny, a fellow patient constantly escaping from the hospital, motor-mouthed, high-pitched Chris Tucker (Rush Hour) is surprisingly good even if his soulful dance moves came across as a convenient plot device. Julia Stiles (Mona Lisa Smile) shows up in a smallish role as Tiffany's patronizing, status-conscious sister Veronica. The climax induces the right emotions even if it means the uncertainties in the plot get wrapped up all too neatly.",4,"A Different Kind of a Romcom with Quirkily Effective, Seriocomic Touches",1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,2973,"['Portraying', 'mental', 'illness', 'usually', ""'ll"", 'see', 'bravura', 'scenes', 'set', 'asylum', 'likeOne', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'NestorThe', 'Snake', 'Pit', 'iconoclastic', 'filmmaker', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'Fighter', 'edges', 'emotional', 'disequilibrium', 'compellingly', 'quirky', '2012', 'dramedy', 'Based', 'thesame-name', '2008', 'novelby', 'Matthew', 'Quick', 'film', 'bit', 'Russell', '1999', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'comedy', 'Flirting', 'Disaster', 'seriocomically', 'volatile', 'dynamics', 'here', 'are', 'amplified', 'central', 'character', 'precarious', 'psychological', 'state', 'High', 'school', 'teacher', 'Pat', 'Solitano', 'Jr.', 'man', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'who', 'spent', 'eight', 'months', 'Baltimore', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'violent', 'episode', 'caused', 'seeing', 'wife', 'Nikki', 'cheating', 'fellow', 'teacher', 'released', 'care', 'parents', 'determined', 'win', 'back', 'estranged', 'wife.As', 'improve', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'Maxwell', 'facing', 'own', 'level', 'mental', 'instability', 'becoming', 'widowed', 'turning', 'indiscriminate', 'sex', 'co-workers', 'most', 'recently', 'losing', 'job', 'Eventually', 'strike', 'deal', 'where', 'will', 'help', 'win', 'back', 'wife', 'dance', 'competition', 'coping', 'disorders', 'same', 'time', 'first', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Hangover', 'Solitano', 'idea', 'showing', 'manically', 'obsessive', 'behavior', 'speak', 'loudly', 'monotone', 'much', 'nuance', 'performance', 'grew', 'Russell', 'screenplay', 'had', 'show', 'more', 'layers', 'character', 'hard', 'time', 'eliciting', 'sympathy', 'anyone', 'much', 'less', 'audience', '21', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'would', 'appear', 'too', 'young', 'play', 'sex-addicted', 'cop', 'widow', 'Tiffany', 'preternatural', 'ability', 'convey', 'unforced', 'maturity', 'conviction', 'losing', 'touch', 'character', 'deep-seeded', 'vulnerability.Perhaps', 'film', 'nicest', 'surprise', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'sterling', 'performance', 'Pat', 'Sr.', 'best', 'work', 'years', 'silly', 'shenanigans', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'partnerships', 'Exhibiting', 'character', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'powerful', 'brief', 'scenes', 'De', 'Niro', 'vividly', 'how', 'apple', ""n't"", 'fall', 'too', 'far', 'tree', 'Completely', 'submerging', 'Australian', 'roots', 'favor', 'convincing', 'Mid-Atlantic', 'accent', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'effectively', 'lone', 'voice', 'sanity', 'Pat', 'mother', 'constantly', 'fretting', 'son', 'preparing', 'crabby', 'snacks', 'homemades', 'home', 'viewing', 'family', 'beloved', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'Pat', 'best', 'friend', 'Danny', 'fellow', 'patient', 'constantly', 'escaping', 'hospital', 'motor-mouthed', 'high-pitched', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'even', 'soulful', 'dance', 'moves', 'came', 'convenient', 'plot', 'device', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'up', 'smallish', 'role', 'Tiffany', 'patronizing', 'status-conscious', 'sister', 'Veronica', 'climax', 'right', 'emotions', 'even', 'uncertainties', 'plot', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'too', 'neatly']",Silver Linings Playbook

The deal is she does something for him and in return he has to be her dance partner for this competition. He's still obsessing over his ex wife after he gets out of a mental hospital. He's desperate to get back with her and just to have some kind of contact with her again. He uses Lawrence to try to get to her because her sister is friends with Bradley's ex.

1572450,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B008OGIPJA,Eric Sanberg,"[4, 7]","Now and then a movie comes along that works on nearly every level and bowls you over. For me, this was one of those movies.Here's the scoop. Pat is bi-polar. He's just out of an institution, where he spent the better part of a year, after having beat up a guy he found in the shower with his wife. Now he's back with mom and dad and needs to put his life back together. He becomes acquainted with a local girl who has some serious baggage of her own. Together they work on getting back on track.This is a near perfect film. It's shot in a very un-Hollywood style. There's a lot of hand-held camera and natural light. You feel as though you occupy the same space as the characters. The dialogue is outstanding and the performances are equally as good. De Niro is always good but I've grown a bit tired of him over the years. That disappeared while watching this. Here's a father who couldn't understand his son's problems as a child, and now is feeling the guilt in how those problems have nearly ruined his son's life. He himself has issues with obsessive, compulsive disorder. That he's lost his job and is working as a bookie is adding to the household problems. Mom does what she can but has to struggle to get her voice heard.What really is happening here is the relationship between Pat and Tiffany. Brad Cooper as Pat and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany are great together. They dish out a lot of crap to each other, and there are a lot of fits and starts, but slowly they come to see something in each other. They take each other outside of their perspective comfort zones and that helps them move forward.Unfortunately, it gets very Hollywood at the end and the script goes from being very natural to very contrived. It's a shame because up to that point it's as good as any movie you are likely to see. But don't be put off.

Jackie Weaver.At its heart, the film is, surprise surprise, a bit of a fable, a bit of candy floss, with a fairy-tale ending.It was a bit weird to see Lucky Thompson's brother from Boardwalk Empire turn up as Cooper's brother - that was a bit of a clanger for me. Great actor - wrong role to cast him in.I thought the film was a mite simplistic and really didn't go into any great detail about anything.After watching it, I do not entirely understand why Lawrence got her Oscar for her role in the film. I cannot now remember any of the other contenders, but I didn't think she got as much under the skin of her character the way Cooper was able to.Obviously, that is just my personal opinion. The Oscars were handed out and Lawrence is riding a well-deserved wave to super-stardom - I don't wish to detract from that one iota.I guess I would have liked to see these same two leads tackle the story with a denser script when they are perhaps 10-15 years older.It has some beautifully achieved moments and has a lot of serious things to say without slapping you between the eyes with a dead fish to get the message across.It is also tragic in parts and at its heart the film is about the fracture lines that may evolve in human lives but also what might come along.For me the main message was to persevere, and that where one may be falling it takes another, and usually more than one, usually family, to help.In a nutshell, unconditional love.I didn't give it 4 stars (just missed out) as I didn't think it entirely warranted such a rating, but it still has much to say and the performances are all solid.Maybe for me it was the storyline/screenplay that underwhelmed me a little - I felt I'd seen it all before.

Have no second thoughts here, my friends, this is the movie you're expecting. If you're interested in movies with intelligent, witty dialogue with performances that exceed even YOUR incredibly high expectations, Silver Linings Playbook is the I Ching of 2012. Director/writer David O. Russel showed us with The Fighter and now he shows us with this film that he can take you to the lowest aspects of a human's personality in a very real way and still have you care and even identify with what you're seeing on screen. In a world where most films you see nowadays struggle to hold your attention with fast paced editing and over the top CG special effects, Russel manages to tell a simple narrative about a guy coming home from a mental hospital and somehow make it the most entertaining things you'll see this year. By giving it a multitude of depth and subtext to its characters, Russel creates a portrait of a family trying to deal with their clinically deemed crazy family member while also refusing to acknowledge the little bit of crazy inherent in each and every one of us.

Anupam Kher was also excellent as Dr. Patel.  The pacing was excellent, and helped to make the theme easier to take, and it isn't an easy theme.  In many ways, the entire film is in the form of variations on therapy.  The main character is bipolar, and authentically resists taking lithium.  Dramatic scenes between Cooper and Lawrence often resemble  breakthroughs in therapy.  Pat Jr's father played by De Niro seems to have similar issues, and bipolarity tends to run in families. One of the twists that I especially like about this film is that it follows the form of a typical sports-based film, but the final &#34;game&#34; isn't football or baseball.  Lawrence as Tiffany is sharp and quick, and a perfect complement to Cooper's often hypomanic Pat The film has intensity and heart, and a moving ending.  I wanted to see it because a review mentioned a creative over-the-shoulder sequence.  It is also au courrant with steadycam technique.

When I heard it received 8 Academy Award/Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, I thought, oh, it must be life-affirming good; when I heard ""playbook,"" I thought, okay, it must be mostly about football; and when I heard about Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar win for Best Actress, I thought, well, her character must get sick in the movie, like Debra Winger in ""Terms of Endearment."" Well, as it turns out, I was wrong on all three accounts, and though not similar (but good in its own right), it certainly is not up on the same level with ""Terms of Endearment"" (try watching them back to back). Based on a novel, I never expected to so quickly file it under the category of being a little, dare I say it, sappy (the kicker being the Christmas-lights scene in the street towards the end) with its ""silver linings"" and few surprises (like the identity of the letter writer; the letter was typed out, for goodness' sake), only with slight variations in characters you would usually see in movies, and stretched out over no less than 122 minutes! (Did we really need to see that whole ""Dancing with the Stars"" subplot?) On the plus side, though, were great acting performances all around (including I'm-not-just-a-pretty-boy Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro, and Jacki Weaver, all Oscar-nominated, too), not just by the lovely Lawrence, even while dropping several F-bombs (unnecessary), though it was actually DeNiro who delivered the Oscar-caliber performance, with the best scenes actually not between Lawrence and Cooper but between DeNiro and Cooper, father and son (especially when Dad, through tears, blames himself for his son's issues, seeming to want to make amends in that touching father-and-son scene at the end of the dance competition, when pleading for his son to choose the girl he really loves so that his son can finally find true happiness, with Junior embracing his Dad as if realizing this and forgiving him; their relationship should have been the movie's focal point, even if it wasn't so in the book), with the movie's most redeeming value being its positive portrayal of people with mental health issues as people we all know and love.

Well, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the enormously successful answer. Based on the novel by the same name by Matthew Quick and freely adapted for the screen by writer/director David O. Russell, this stage brings an unusually fine opportunity to reveal the rather phenomenal talents of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence while also demonstrating the brilliance of ensemble productions.The story briefly outlined is as follows: Against medical advice and without the knowledge of her husband Pat Solatano Sr. (Robert DeNIro), caring Dolores Solatano (Jacki Weaver) discharges her adult son, Pat Solatano Jr. (Bradley Cooper), from a Maryland mental hospital after his minimum eight month court ordered stint. The condition of the release includes Pat Jr. moving back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home. Although Pat Jr.'s institutionalization was due to his beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Nikki has since left him and has received a restraining order against him. Although he is on medication (which he doesn't take because of the way it makes him feel) and has mandatory therapy sessions with Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), Pat Jr. feels like he can manage on the outside solely by healthy living and looking for the ""silver linings"" in his life. His goals are to get his old job back as a substitute teacher, but more importantly reunite with Nikki. He finds there are certain instances where he doesn't cope well, however no less so than some others who have never been institutionalized, such as his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed OCD father who has resorted to being a bookie to earn a living, his best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) who quietly seethes over the control wielded by his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), and Veronica's widowed sister, Tiffany Maxwell 9Jennifer Lawrence), a recovering sex addict. In their fragile mental states, Pat Jr. and Tiffany embark on a love/hate friendship based primarily on what help the other can provide in achieving their individual goals. But they may reevaluate their goals as their relationship progresses.The entire cast is superb - including Chris Tucker as a mentally challenged friend Jake - and the joy of the film is that even while dealing with the controversial subject of bipolar disorder, the story and the actors portraying the characters (each bruised in a particular way) always seems real and gains our empathy. But it is the glow of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence walking the very thin line of social adjustment with the grace of the finest of actors that makes this film so special.

So when I read a review of ""Silver Linings Playbook"", I was intrigued.  How would Cooper handle a challenging role like that of Pat Solatano, the bipolar mess of a main character in this movie, which was billed as a romantic comedy but is dark and gritty, more like an indie movie with a star like Joseph Gordon-Levitt?  Beautifully, is the answer, and he and the terrific cast of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" make this movie work.In David O. Russell's gifted hands, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" becomes one man's struggle to right the world which he thinks has desperately done him wrong.  Pat (Bradley Cooper) is in deep trouble when we first meet him.  His mother cuts a deal with the courts for his early release from a mental institution in Baltimore and it is clear from the first that Pat is hardly ready for this transition.  He refuses to take the meds for his bipolar disorder, which was kicked into high gear when he discovered his wife in the shower with one of her teaching colleagues.  He almost beat this man to death, and despite institutionalization and group therapy, the rage is still boiling within.  At home, father Robert DeNiro is obviously walking a fine line himself.  He is a Philadelphia Eagles fanatic and has a plethora of OCD rituals which he employs before every game to ensure the team's victory.  Dad has anger issues also, and the two get into a fist fight before too long, so a cop is assigned to shadow Pat to ensure that he treads the straight and narrow.  At this point in the movie, it is difficult to find much humor.Into this mix walks Jennifer Lawrence (Tiffany).  We saw just a glimpse of this gifted actress in ""Like Crazy"", where she played The Other Woman with such finesse and sympathy.  Her character in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is much more complex, and she is a bit of a mess herself.  A young widow who reacts to her cop husband's untimely death with reckless promiscuity, she recognizes a kindred spirit in Pat.  She falls for him immediately, but he is too mired in his obsession with his wife to recognize it at first.  After cutting a sharp bargain with him, she begins spending a lot of time with Pat, and in turn this leads to redemption for both of them.At first I thought the plot device tied up the threads of the story a little too neatly, but then I decided it hardly mattered.  The acting by the entire cast is stellar, and I especially enjoyed DeNiro and his football obsession.  There is a scene in the Eagles' football stadium that is just funny and terrific.  And Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have great chemistry, which really makes it work.",4,Pat but not smug,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,2703,"[""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'movies', 'Hangover', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'when', 'read', 'review', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'was', 'intrigued', 'How', 'would', 'Cooper', 'handle', 'challenging', 'role', 'Pat', 'Solatano', 'bipolar', 'mess', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'billed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'dark', 'gritty', 'more', 'indie', 'movie', 'star', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Beautifully', 'answer', 'terrific', 'cast', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'make', 'movie', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'gifted', 'hands', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'right', 'world', 'desperately', 'done', 'wrong', 'Pat', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'deep', 'trouble', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'mother', 'deal', 'courts', 'early', 'release', 'mental', 'institution', 'Baltimore', 'clear', 'first', 'Pat', 'hardly', 'ready', 'transition', 'take', 'meds', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'was', 'kicked', 'high', 'gear', 'when', 'discovered', 'wife', 'shower', 'one', 'teaching', 'colleagues', 'almost', 'beat', 'man', 'death', 'institutionalization', 'group', 'therapy', 'rage', 'still', 'boiling', 'home', 'father', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'obviously', 'walking', 'fine', 'line', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'fanatic', 'plethora', 'OCD', 'rituals', 'game', 'ensure', 'team', 'victory', 'Dad', 'anger', 'issues', 'also', 'two', 'get', 'fist', 'fight', 'too', 'long', 'cop', 'assigned', 'shadow', 'Pat', 'ensure', 'straight', 'narrow', 'point', 'movie', 'difficult', 'find', 'much', 'humor.Into', 'mix', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Tiffany', 'saw', 'just', 'glimpse', 'gifted', 'actress', 'Crazy', 'where', 'played', 'Other', 'Woman', 'such', 'finesse', 'sympathy', 'character', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'bit', 'mess', 'young', 'widow', 'who', 'cop', 'husband', 'untimely', 'death', 'reckless', 'promiscuity', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'Pat', 'immediately', 'too', 'mired', 'obsession', 'wife', 'recognize', 'first', 'cutting', 'sharp', 'bargain', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'Pat', 'turn', 'redemption', 'them.At', 'first', 'thought', 'plot', 'device', 'tied', 'up', 'threads', 'story', 'little', 'too', 'neatly', 'then', 'decided', 'hardly', 'mattered', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'stellar', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'DeNiro', 'football', 'obsession', 'scene', 'Eagles', 'football', 'stadium', 'just', 'funny', 'terrific', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'really', 'work']",Silver Linings Playbook

1572526,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B008OGIPJA,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","So, the David O. Russell who directed SPANKING THE MONKEY and THREE KINGS is now making Oscar bait films. It's rare for a heralded director of indie (SPANKING THE MONKEY) or fringe Hollywood (THREE KINGS) filmmaking to maintain the things that made him so unique a voice and still make the short list for the Awards season. Well, as with he did with 2010's THE FIGHTER, Russell gives us an gritty and emotional but an ultimately heart-warming, crowd-pleasing, life-affirming film about overcoming the odds and getting your heart's desire that is also packed with an extraordinary ensemble and a supreme standout performance. This is what Russell has become over time, and while this is a good quality film, it's not what I used to go to David O. Russell films to see.Based on the novel by Matthew Quick, you have Pat (Bradley Cooper, in what apparently amounts to a nomination-worthy performance), who is leaving a state hospital in Baltimore with his mother (Jacki Weaver) back to their home in Philadelphia. Pat suffers from a bipolar disorder, finally diagnosed after a severe altercation with the man sleeping with his wife (he beat the crap out of him), and as part of a plea agreement, he decided to be admitted. He arrives back home to his father Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro, for once, NOT phoning it in as he's done for the last several years, since probably RONIN), a severely superstitious (or is it OCD) man about his beloved Philidelphia Eagles and after losing his job and pension, he has become a bookmaker. Pat, upon returning home, has a singular goal: To get back his wife Nikki, and he'll do whatever he feels necessary to do so, seeing his ""silver linings"" in the opportunities he looks to create. Still severely unhinged, he goes to a dinner thrown by his best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) and his extremely domineering wife Veronica (a severely underused Julia Stiles) and meets Veronica's younger, similarly unhinged sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who recently lost her cop husband in a car accident and they form a strangely provocative bond. It is through this chance meeting (or is it chance?) that both Pat and Tiffany seek normalcy and solace in each other as they seem to try to out-crazy each other, each looking at their own goals: Pat wants Nikki back, and Tiffany wants to compete in a freestyle dance competition. Oh, and there's also Chris Tucker here as a somwehat innocuous fellow inmate of the hospital who keeps escaping.Russell is an adept director as always, and he keeps things moving very fluidly, but the film leaves you asking a lot of questions. Is it supposed to be a comedy? A drama? A film about dealing with mental illness? What purpose does Chris Tucker serve (not only in this film, but in the universe)? Why doesn't the film ever deal with Pat Sr. as far as his possible mental illness? Why does the film almost completely ignore Jacki Weaver? Why does Tiffany seem like the only character that's well-rounded?Well, I do have an answer to that one. As he did with THE FIGHTER, Russell seems to LOVE to showcase one singularly talented person in an extremely showy role. In THE FIGHTER, it was Christian Bale, and he won (deservedly so) the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for that film. In this film, that showcase is given to Jennifer Lawrence, who (not quite so deservedly so) won Best Actress for this film. Make no mistake; it's a great performance. Is it Oscar-worthy? Of nomination? Yes. Of winning? No, or at least not against Jessica Chastain and her totally immersive and subtle performance in ZERO DARK THIRTY. But there's the rub; The Weinstein Company who produced this film, and the Weinstein's former studio Miramax, blitz the living hell out of the Oscar voters in massive campaigns that are reminiscent of presidential campaigns. This is how in 1999, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE beat SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and more recently, how, in 2010, THE KING'S SPEECH defeated THE SOCIAL NETWORK. Just on a bit of a tangent here, let's face it; Oscar voters LOVE the opportunity to celebrate performances that show great impersonations of real-life figures (Edith Piaf, Idi Amin, Truman Capote, Abraham Lincoln, etc.), people mimicking disabilites or mental issues (RAIN MAN, MY LEFT FOOT, FORREST GUMP, SHINE, etc.), and big, showy, bombastic performances like Bale's in THE FIGHTER or Lawrence's in this film. And then, every once in a while, they'll find the year to give it to the right person.In the final analysis, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a very good, very solid film with some excellent performances, and it really does a little more than the bare minimum to be complete. But is this a film for the ages, like THREE KINGS or is this a performance that will be remembered, other than it being Lawrence's first win (which she deserved more for her first nomination, the brilliant WINTER'S BONE)? Like Pat and Tiffany's dance competition, it doesn't stand a chance.3.5 out of 5 stars.",4,"Solid and crowd-pleasing, but what happened to the old David O.

Not that I didn't find the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence enjoyable to watch.  They both breathed a lot of vitality into their roles, especially in the penultimate dance scene which was great fun.  Unfortunately, the film floundered when dear Dad's bookmaking figured into the plot, dragging this movie down into an all too predictable set of events.I would have thought more critics would have responded to the sloppy writing, but it seems they too were swept away by the bravura performances and gave David O. Russell a pass on his ""playbook.""  All his movies have clunked in my opinion, largely because they flirt too much with disaster, resting heavily on engaging ideas and not enough on script.  Beyond a few great early scenes like that when Pat takes exception to how Hemingway chose to end Farewell to Arms, there was little to remember in the way of clever dialog. What you do remember is the passion that played out between Pat and Tiffany, largely thanks to their great physical performances.  They needed no words when it came to dancing, or running for that matter.  Their expressions said it all.Chris Tucker similarly made scenes funny not by what he said, but how he said it.  Unfortunately, he was little more than a comic foil whenever Russell reached a dramatic dead end.  As for De Niro, we have seen him play this role one too many times.  This time the overly obsessed Dad takes football too seriously.  Jacki Weaver makes for an engaging Mom, but her role is limited, mostly because she never seems to know what to say.  Put some words in her mouth, David!It seems like you need to readThe Playbookto make any sense out of what happened in the end, as it is befuddling to think Pat would let Nikki go so easily after the entire movie was built around him bettering himself for one fateful meeting, or that he would so blithely accept the situation after knowing what led up to it.  Whatever transpired between he and Nikki was left to a whisper.  I guess Russell didn't want to deal with such ornery matters, preferring to end it on the dance floor with a leggy Jennifer Lawrence leaving no doubt in any viewer's mind that she was the one.For all the raves, I expected much more.  Instead, it was the fluff I've come to expect from Russell, a director who still doesn't seem to have conquered adolescence.  Fortunately, he had actors who could make up for the gaping plot holes in this story, along with a great soundtrack that included some oddities like Brubeck's Unsquare Dance.",3,"Great Performances, but I don't know about the Playbook",1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,2594,"['guess', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'was', 'underwhelmed', 'film', 'Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'chemistry', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'breathed', 'lot', 'vitality', 'roles', 'especially', 'penultimate', 'dance', 'scene', 'was', 'great', 'fun', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'floundered', 'when', 'dear', 'Dad', 'bookmaking', 'figured', 'plot', 'dragging', 'movie', 'down', 'too', 'predictable', 'set', 'events.I', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'more', 'critics', 'would', 'have', 'responded', 'sloppy', 'writing', 'too', 'were', 'swept', 'away', 'bravura', 'performances', 'gave', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'pass', 'playbook', 'movies', 'have', 'clunked', 'opinion', 'largely', 'flirt', 'too', 'much', 'disaster', 'resting', 'heavily', 'engaging', 'ideas', 'not', 'enough', 'script', 'few', 'great', 'early', 'scenes', 'when', 'Pat', 'exception', 'how', 'Hemingway', 'chose', 'end', 'Farewell', 'Arms', 'was', 'little', 'remember', 'way', 'clever', 'dialog', 'What', 'do', 'remember', 'passion', 'played', 'out', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'largely', 'thanks', 'great', 'physical', 'performances', 'needed', 'words', 'when', 'came', 'dancing', 'running', 'matter', 'expressions', 'said', 'Tucker', 'similarly', 'made', 'scenes', 'funny', 'not', 'what', 'said', 'how', 'said', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'comic', 'foil', 'whenever', 'Russell', 'reached', 'dramatic', 'dead', 'end', 'De', 'Niro', 'have', 'seen', 'play', 'role', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'time', 'overly', 'obsessed', 'Dad', 'football', 'too', 'seriously', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'engaging', 'Mom', 'role', 'limited', 'mostly', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'Put', 'words', 'mouth', 'David', 'need', 'readThe', 'Playbookto', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'befuddling', 'think', 'Pat', 'would', 'let', 'Nikki', 'go', 'so', 'easily', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'built', 'bettering', 'one', 'fateful', 'meeting', 'would', 'so', 'blithely', 'situation', 'knowing', 'what', 'led', 'up', 'transpired', 'Nikki', 'was', 'left', 'whisper', 'guess', 'Russell', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'deal', 'such', 'ornery', 'matters', 'preferring', 'end', 'dance', 'floor', 'leggy', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'leaving', 'doubt', 'viewer', 'mind', 'was', 'one.For', 'raves', 'expected', 'much', 'more', 'Instead', 'was', 'fluff', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Russell', 'director', 'who', 'still', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'conquered', 'adolescence', 'Fortunately', 'had', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'up', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'story', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'included', 'oddities', 'Brubeck', 'Unsquare', 'Dance']",Silver Linings Playbook

Particularly when he seems to be interacting with a troubled young widow who is no more predictable than he.In this engaging dramedy, we see a plot painted with broad strokes, but delivered by a cast capable of great skill and subtlety:* Bradley Cooper (""The Words"") is Pat, absolutely convinced that only one ""incident"" caused his problem and it can easily be explained. Of course what he views as ""normal"" might be the issue here...that plus the restraining order his ex-wife has filed.* Jennifer Lawrence (""The Hunger Games"") is Tiffany, a recent acquaintance with a questionable past, but it too, can be easily explained. This young widow is still working her way toward ""normal.""* Robert De Niro (""Limitless"") is Pat Sr., a cantankerous, controlling, obsessive compulsive, who wants to open a restaurant, but is willing to wager that his son won't let him down. From him we get a lot of insight into the family dynamics and what is considered ""normal.""* Jacki Weaver (""The Five-Year Engagement"") is Delores, the long-suffering wife and mother of our two favorite odd-balls. Chaos is ""normal"" for her.* Anupam Kher (""Bend it Like Beckham"") is Dr. Cliff Patel, our hero's therapist...  and a sports fan! He's still trying to define ""normal.""* Chris Tucker (the ""Rush Hour"" franchise) is Danny, escape artist par excellence! He met our hero in the mental institution; Danny may be crazy, but he's not dumb!It is disconcerting to see a person deliberately refuse his medications, so I had a lot of misgivings about a movie that seems to endorse that behavior. On the other hand, we could see that the OCD apple didn't fall very far from the tree. I can only say that our hero's mother deserves to have her ample chest covered with medals!In this R-rated film, expect lots of profanity, a glimpse of (maybe) nudity, no sweaty bodies, no gunshots and no blowie uppie stuff (except tempers, e.g., watch our hero when he finishes Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms!).

He moves back in with his parents, a devoted and long-suffering mother and a father who's a violent football fan.  Pat's determined to win back his wife, and to do so enlists Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young depressed woman who's just lost her husband in a car accident.  In return, Tiffany asks Pat to be her dance partner.While Pat and Tiffany definitely have issues, it's this movie that's truly schizophrenic.First, I have questions about the casting.  Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence come across as too stupid and boring to actually have mental issues (the idea that Cooper is an undiagnosed bi-polar is just laughable).  Either a Ben Stiller type or an Owen Wilson type (vulnerable but lovable) would have made much more sense.  And there's an endless list of Hollywood leading ladies who could easily come across as mentally deranged, but Jennifer Lawrence just isn't one of them.  There's just too much force, willpower, and assertiveness to believe that Jennifer Lawrence's character Tiffany is vulnerable and depressed.Second, the plot is incoherent, manipulative, and opportunistic.  Because this is a romantic comedy, we already know how the movie's going to end, and the movie doesn't need to add so many redundant subplots.  A lot of the turns and twists don't really make much sense either.Third, there's just too much screaming and shouting in the film.  People with mental issues don't necessarily just scream and shout at each other in public all the time -- often, the expression of mental exhaustion and stress is soft and quiet, and thus the more twisted and violent.  As it stands, Pat and Tiffany seem less like troubled individuals, and more like hormonal teenagers.But despite these flaws the movie does work, and it works in large part because of these flaws.  The flaws create so much uneasy tension that a resolution -- any stupid resolution, really -- is a relief.

1572573,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B008OGIPJA,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[7, 11]","You would think I couldn't like a romantic comedy that celebrates the Philadelphia Eagles and has dancing. That's a bad combination for me. I grew up in the Washington D.C. area and spent over half my life in the area watching and rooting for the Redskins through the 1980's and on winning three super bowls with great players like Gary Clark, Monte Coleman, Art Monk, Darrell Green, Charles Mann, Brian Mitchell, Mark Rypien and Ricky Sanders. I along with our family grew up hating the Eagles, Cowboys and Giants. It's ingrained on our brains, and to be honest they suck. Any way it makes it harder for me to enjoy films that revolve around these teams, and then the romantic comedy factor. I'm not a big fan of the genre. Sure I've enjoyed some like Wimbledon, The Princess Bride, Pretty Woman and Sweet Home Alabama, but in general the genre sucks. I know the films are primarily made for women, but in most there is no chemistry between the leads, which makes the romance unbelievable. There is also usually the lack of character growth or predictable characters and in general the predictability of the genre. You know how it's going to end so the journey is the most important thing and if it isn't believable or the characters aren't likeable, compelling or you have a reason to root for the film fails. You would think with these two things going against Silver Linings that I wouldn't like it, but I did. I truly loved the Silver Linings Playbook.First off of course the film is predictable. You know how it's most likely going to end from the trailer, but it's the journey getting there is what truly makes this film so good. The film is adapted from novel with the same name and by the author Matthew Quick. The story follows Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) who's in a mental health institution in Baltimore after he loses everything in his life. His wife Nikki cheats on him with a fellow cheater from his school and he nearly beats the man to death. Pat loses his job, home, has a restraining order taken out by his wife, finds out that he is bipolar and ends up in a mental institution. The emotionally unstable Pat is taken out by his mother Dolores Solitano (Jacki Weaver) and brought home to Philadelphia where he'll live with his die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan and bookie Pat Solitano Sr. (Robert De Niro). Arriving home Pat stops taking his pills and is determined to better his life, because he believes that if he does so Nikki will take him back even though his family and friends doubt that will happen. Hopping to get in contact with Nikki he goes to dinner with his friends Ronnie (John Ortiz) and Veronica (Julia Stiles) home where he meets Veronica's sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who recently lost her husband and had a break down as well going into deep depression. Almost instantly the two form a connection though Pat doesn't want to see it. The two scarred and emotionally unstable characters deal with their deep issues, their families as they form a bond helping each other and find a silver lining in their screwed up lives. I think that's all I'll talk about plot wise. As for the two main characters their believable and genuine and I had empathy and understood some of what they are going through. About twelve years ago I was put in a mental hospital for a short period of time and suffered from deep depression resulting in me taking pills. In fact I still suffer from occasional depression that that I take a pills for along with pills for blood pressure and I know what they can do to you and finding a silver lining in my at the time in my screwed up life. It can be anything or anyone like finding a friend or just dancing like Pat and Veronica do in the film as long as you find something that gives you hope. The characters are believable and real chemistry and as the film goes on you become invested in these characters and truly root from them to get together. The story and film even brought some tears to my eyes and I'm guy, and that rarely happens especially in romantic comedies, but this film is moving. Now as for the comedy is more muted and not over the top nor is it forced. It's believable and you actually think the characters would say what they do and it really works as I wouldn't even call it a comedy. I think it has more in common with a romantic drama that has humorous moments.The small role Chris Tucker has in the film as Danny a friend of Pat's from the mental institution is Tucker's best acting performance to date. Sure he's not a great actor mainly doing comedy, but here he's not comedic side kick and actually shows more of his dramatic acting ability with his toned down comedy. Robert De Niro hasn't been at the top of his game over the last decade with performances in Killer Elite, Hide and Seek, Righteous Kill and Godsend, but he is still a good and capable actor. Is Pat Sr. the best character he's played no or is the character a little lacking yes, but De Niro brings the character to life and the emotional weight as Pat Sr. tries to connect to his son that he hasn't always been there for. John Ortiz does a good job as Ronnie, Pats good friend who tries to help Pat even though he's slowly suffocating in his own life. Obviously the film belongs to Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I'm not the biggest fan of Bradley Cooper or his acting ability. The only film I truly liked him in was Limitless. He showed off his acting ability which he puts on display in Silver Linings. He brings emotional depth to Pat and his struggles with accepting his Bipolar, deals with family issues and falls in love with Tiffany. For me Jennifer Lawrence is the star. I first noticed Jennifer, and her beauty in her supporting role in X-Men: First Class. I fell in love with her and her acting ability after seeing the Winter's Bone and The Hunger Games showing she could hold a film basically all by herself. She embodies Tiffany and truly brings the character to life showing of her acting range and ability. Jennifer should be nominator for an Oscar for her roles in The Hunger Games and Silver Linings. To be honest I think she should be nominated twice though that is by love and bias for the young actress. The only actress and character who I thought didn't work or was missed cast was Julia Stiles as Veronica. Julia just didn't look like she was emotionally there throughout her scenes in the film. Thank fully she was a sub-supporting actress and had only a limited number of scenes that didn't affect the film.I sure did love the film Three Kings. It's a great and underrated war film about post war Iraq after the first Gulf War with a really good story and good performances by George Clooney, Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg. Until I saw Silver Linings Playbook, Three Kings was my favorite David O. Russell film. Though to be honest it's the only film of his I've seen. No I still haven't seen The Fighter and don't know when I will. In Silver Linings he again shows his ability as a writer and director bringing together the moving story and actors to make one of the best films of the year and the best romantic comedy I've seen. I'm not a big fan of Danny Elfman who performed the score with many of his scores sounding the same never bringing live to the films he does scores for, but he does a good job with the different moods and tones of the film helping to bring to the film to life.I survived a genre I don't really like and film that surrounds itself with a team I hate and came out loving the film. Silver Lining is a nearly perfect film with great chemistry between the lead characters and actors with a believable story, great directing, music and it's only small flaw is with a few of its supporting cast. I know some people may have a different opinion and may not like it as much as I do, but in my opinion Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best films of the year and the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. The film deserves all the Oscar praise it's been getting and I hope it gets at very least nominations for best director, actor and actress. I loved the film and highly recommend it.",5,One of the most emotionally moving and satisfying romantic films ever.,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,8102,"['would', 'think', 'could', ""n't"", 'like',

I have to say not only was I glad that Jennifer Lawrence win the much deserved Academy award, but Bradley Cooper gives a surprisingly  great performance. The Chemistry their characters(Pat & Tiffany) have is almost instant and stays that way the entire movie.Some supporting cast include Robert De Niro(who was nominated for his role and has a very memorable quote in the movie that to this day is still stuck in my head), Chris Tucker(who did a great job as well) Jacki Weaver; Julia Stiles is also in SLP. I need not tell you that the supporting cast all did an amazing job in this movie.The Storyline is realistic as it is relatable. David O Russell did a Wonderful job crafting, and directing Silver Linings Playbook.2012 was one of the best years (in a long time) for books being adapted into movies.

It is one of the most poignant, touching and funny movies that I've seen it a long time. It treats mental illness and grief with a grace that is seldom seen in either film or literature. I won't discuss particulars of the plot because I won't give away the gifts the movie gives you. And they are gifts. Once you've seen it, you'll know why I say it.A few things to touch on outside of the plot, though - Sorry Christoph Walz, but Robert De Niro was robbed of the Oscar. De Niro was the best I've seen him in years. He made me cry and few actors can bring one so close to their characters that their characters become real and not just faces on a screen. Walz is funny, but I've yet to see more than one note in his acting. De Niro is like a symphony. He should have won.Bradley Cooper is fabulous and is going to be one of the best actors of his generation. Few come close to his range. (And no, I've never seen him in anything else. This movie was enough to convince me of his talent.)Finally, Jennifer Lawrence's character was about as different from the Hunger Games character as possible and she earned that Oscar with a breathtaking performance.  I can't say why without giving the plot away, but wow, was she broken and fierce and so much more mature than her 21 years. Just wonderful.See the movie.

1572609,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B008OGIPJA,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.So I finally got around to watching Silver Linings Playbook, the movie that everyone's been talking about, and I must say that I was pretty impressed. It's not perfect, but it has a lot of heart and I honestly can't remember seeing a movie this emotionally driven. It deals with some tough issues, mainly mental instability, and it does so with a degree of classiness that transforms this from a movie about the troubled to an emotional story about the changes people face on a day to day basis. We always want to go back to what we know, but sometimes that's not always what's best for us and we need to learn to move on.The story follows a young man by the name of Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) as he's released from a mental health facility. Eight months ago he caught his wife cheating on him and that's when he found out that he was suffering from a bipolar disorder. In an attempt to stay out of prison after beating his wife's lover half to death, he settled on a plea bargain with the courts allowing him to attend this mental facility to better himself. After his mom picks him up from the facility he creates a plan. He's going to do a lot of reading and exercising in order to keep his mind in a solid place, but he has a major roadblock. He can't let go of his wife.After having dinner at his friend Ronnie's (John Oritz) house, Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence). Tiffany is a recent widow who just lost her job. She suffers from extreme depression which she handles by sleeping around with random people to help fill that void. She strikes up a deal with Pat when she tells him that she can get his letter to his wife. He would do it himself, but she had a restraining order put on him. In return for her help Pat agrees to assist her with this upcoming dance competition. What starts as two people helping each other soon turns into a deal filled with lies and deceit as the viewer learns that one of the parties involved may not be as helpful as they led you to believe. It's not done with ill intention so it feels fitting given the situation of both of these individuals.As a whole I felt the story was solid. I think the main focus was on these troubled individuals who are looked at as psychos in the ""real"" world when really they're just like everyone else. They're people struggling through life just like the rest of us. So I thought it was commendable when both the leads and a few of the supporting characters all had some sort of mental problem. What makes matters worse for these characters is that people do look at them like some sort of circus show. Whenever Pat would have an episode there was this kid who kept coming to the house to see if he could record it for ""a school project"". It makes you empathize with Pat and it leaves you feeling disgusted that there are people like that in the world.Everything in the story leads up to the dance competition and that's where I felt the film got a little rocky. It felt more like a means to an end than something substantial and I kind of felt like it derailed the mood set by the film's previous hour and 40 minutes. It's very loud and fun while majority of the movie is dark and somber. I understood its purpose in the big picture, but I think there may have been a better way to reach the point the movie sets out to make.Silver Linings Playbook is led by Cooper and Lawrence who both gave excellent performances. Cooper proves once again that he's beyond being the eye-candy in The Hangover films and that he's an actor who everyone should take seriously. This was actually my introduction to Ms. Lawrence and I thought she gave a solid performance. I can't say that I understand all the hype around her just yet, and I don't understand how she won an award over Cooper, but she has a lot of potential. I just feel like she's still a developing actress with a lot of room to grow.On top of the leads you have Robert De Niro playing Pat Senior, Jackie Weaver as Pat's mom, Chris Tucker as Pat's friend Danny, John Ortiz as Ronnie, and Anupam Kher as Pat's therapist Cliff. I said earlier that a few of the supporting characters had mental issues as well and those two characters would be Danny and Pat Sr. I don't remember if they specified what Danny's condition was, but Pat Sr. is a very superstitious individual suffering from OCD and he's also developed a slight gambling problem after losing his job. Out of the supporting cast I think De Niro gave the most memorable performance. He's always been able to tackle almost any role he's given and this was no different. With that said, everyone involved did a great job and it was nice to see Tucker on the big screen again.Finally, the movie suffers from a few minor inconsistencies. The most obvious being when Pat and Tiffany are at the dance. When they start walking up the stairs Pat's on the right and Tiffany's on the left, but once they reach the top they're randomly switched. I don't know about you, but I've never seen two people walking up a set of stairs holding hands only to switch places along the way. Then during one of the practices Pat's necklace is in the front of his shirt, but when frame cuts to Tiffany it's on his back. Lastly, I don't know if it was the lighting or what, but in some scenes Tiffany's hair looks red while in majority of the film it's black, or at least it looked black. Now none of this is major, but it's stuff that I noticed because of who I am.Overall Score: 8.75/10 - Silver Linings Playbook is one of those films that is just so easy to fall in love with. Between the characters and the script everything feels so comfortable and familiar. It's almost as if we know these characters in real life, they just have different faces. Cooper's performance, in particular, is phenomenal and he really brings out the heart and soul of his character and he gave, what I think, is the performance of his career. While the movie may not be perfect, there's a lot to love here and I definitely recommend taking the time to watch it.",4,8.75/10 - Great,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,6067,"['Note', 'May', 'contain',

When she flew into gear in this movie about the time she started to teach Bradly Cooper to dance, I saw what all the snobby critics are seeing in her. This youngster has some very strong acting chops. The last half of the movie, Cooper slowly but surely faded into the background and Ms. Lawrence literally took the movie over, made it her's as she slyly manipulated Cooper emotionally into getting what she wanted for herself all along, or so she thought.To say more would be to ruin this movie if you haven't seen it. We have found the youngest generation's most brilliant actor - this ONE time I will say this: The critics were right! This  movie defines the word drama as in - &#34;Wow, is that girl screaming at her boyfriend a drama queen or what?&#34; Throughout the movie, there seems to be this jittery competition to see who can deliver the most drama to get the title.If you want to know the ending that threw me for a loop - you'll just have to rent it or get it here, or pick it up on the unnamed pay channel. This movie is not like any others I have seen. It is very sexy at times, and yet no one ever has sex in it. The language was rather tame, more than I am hearing it lately. But don't bring the kiddies - it is filled with adult topics and is definitely adult themed. I had a little trouble following it all the way through, as it moves very fast and you never know what most characters are going to do or say. And, I think that's part of what I liked about it. There was an old fashioned feel to it, with quirky and younger pacing.This movie is so brilliant, that you are never sure what will happens next and whether what happens will be a normal moment or, more likely, a crazy moment. Overall, this movie has a dark, emotional, CRAZY, edge to it, which probably wouldn't sit well for someone with a dark and jagged edge. I'd already had a heads up from my friends, so I simply watched it to entertain me, not to ponder whatever the message was for a few days.You'll have to watch the ending for yourselves, though. My fingers are sealed! five stars for whoever asked Jennifer Lawrence to play lead, the rest of the cast who were great, too, and the group of people who worked to bring this craziest movie to the silver screen.",5,They Lied To Me!,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,2831,"['was', 'told', 'several', 'friends', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'terrible', 'did', ""n't"", 'tonight', 'am', 'Amazon', 'addict', 'so', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'will', 'let', 'review', 'stand', 'Tonight', 'came', 'pay', 'channel', 'shall', 'not', 'be', 'named', 'decided', 'would', 'watch', 'curiosity', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'really', 'think', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'Obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'well', 'first', 'hour', 'over-the-top', 'crazy', 'decided', 'friends', 'were', 'right', 'almost', 'deleted', 'then', 'Then', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'young', 'actor', 'like', 'have', 'heard', 'great', 'thing', 'happened', 'When', 'flew', 'gear', 'movie', 'time', 'started', 'teach', 'Bradly', 'Cooper', 'dance', 'saw', 'what', 'snobby', 'critics', 'are', 'seeing', 'youngster', 'very', 'strong', 'acting', 'chops', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'Cooper', 'slowly', 'surely', 'faded', 'background', 'Ms.', 'Lawrence', 'literally', 'took', 'movie', 'made', 'slyly', 'manipulated', 'Cooper', 'emotionally', 'getting', 'what', 'wanted', 'along', 'so', 'thought.To', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'ruin', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'have', 'found', 'youngest', 'generation', 'most', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'ONE', 'time', 'will', 'say', 'critics', 'were', 'right', 'movie', 'word', 'drama', '34', 'Wow', 'girl', 'screaming', 'boyfriend', 'drama', 'queen', 'what', '34', 'movie', 'be', 'jittery', 'competition', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'deliver', 'most', 'drama', 'get', 'title.If', 'want', 'know', 'ending', 'threw', 'loop', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'rent', 'get', 'here', 'pick', 'up', 'unnamed', 'pay', 'channel', 'movie', 'not', 'others', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'sexy', 'times', 'yet', 'one', 'ever', 'sex', 'language', 'was', 'rather', 'tame', 'more', 'am', 'hearing', 'lately', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'kiddies', 'filled', 'adult', 'topics', 'definitely', 'adult', 'themed', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'following', 'way', 'very', 'fast', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'say', 'think', 'part', 'what', 'liked', 'was', 'old', 'fashioned', 'feel', 'quirky', 'younger', 'pacing.This', 'movie', 'so', 'brilliant', 'are', 'never', 'sure', 'what', 'will', 'happens', 'next', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'normal', 'moment', 'more', 'likely', 'crazy', 'moment', 'Overall', 'movie', 'dark', 'emotional', 'CRAZY', 'edge', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'someone', 'dark', 'jagged', 'edge', ""'d"", 'already', 'had', 'heads', 'up', 'friends', 'simply', 'watched', 'entertain', 'not', 'ponder', 'message', 'was', 'few', 'days.You', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'ending', 'yourselves', 'though', 'fingers', 'are', 'sealed', 'five', 'stars', 'whoever', 'asked', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'play', 'lead', 'rest', 'cast', 'who', 'were', 'great', 'too', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'bring', 'craziest', 'movie', 'silver', 'screen']",Silver Linings Playbook

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[3, 5]","Many directors would find it easy, in a movie like this one, to focus on the bleakness of the lead characters' respective illnesses, or reduce their struggles to broad, unfunny slapstick. I admire David O. Russell, who manages to capture the complex, ornery nature of his characters' contrasting struggles. His subtle hand and natural, Mamet-like writing, coupled with an ensemble cast caring enough to sacrifice all pride, produce a work reminiscent of Coppola's best.The chemistry between leads Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence makes for characters who resist easy categories. Both characters have suffered traumas which they cannot live down, and which they try to bury by turning their natural desire for love in inappropriate directions. Their strange courtship, based on half-truths and subtext, resembles no other romantic comedy I can recall, yet reflects entirely too many real, funny, touching relationships I have known.The supporting cast, anchored to Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver as Cooper's parents, give the leads a rich context in which to create their characters. When was the last time you can recall DeNiro stepping back and giving somebody else the glory of all the best lines and most interesting unspoken moments? Yet an actor famous for his own personal dynamism so completely loses himself in the story that he willingly gives of himself so another actor can shine.This film will not reward people who like flash and fire. Despite a few scenes of shouting and fighting, probably all the most extroverted moments got spliced into the trailer. This understated, often moody, and surprisingly hilarious film creates characters and situations we long to see explored, yet doesn't demand loud cheers.

1572640,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008OGIPJA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[124, 142]","David O. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a big hearted and nearly irresistible concoction that presents one of the year's most unlikely romances.  I've been a huge Russell fan since his debut with ""Spanking the Monkey"" and ""Flirting With Disaster"" is one of my favorite flights of outrageousness.  Russell can have an edgy cynicism about his eccentric characters, but he knows how to make an audience identify with even their most offbeat characteristics.  Make no mistake, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is loaded with an expected array of troubled souls.  But the most remarkable thing about this film (and its screenplay) is the amount of compassion it shows to just about everyone.  With a stellar cast including Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DeNiro, Jacki Weaver, Chris Tucker and John Ortiz, the movie boasts easily one of the best ensembles of the year.  Each of these actors is given a fully written character and each makes a huge impression in the screen time allotted.  That's what impressed me most about the film.  It embraces its large cast and allows every member to shine!Cooper plays a man being released from institutionalized care after a violent episode got him into trouble.  Having lost his job and his wife, he is taken in by his parents (Weaver and DeNiro) who must contend with his bipolar condition.  Cooper is single-minded in his pursuit to get back together with his wife, to the point of obsession.  When he meets an odd young widow (Lawrence) dealing with plenty of personal demons, the two seem like they've got a lot in common.  Of course, they seem perfect for each other but Cooper remains oblivious for most of the movie.  Cooper and Lawrence have a great chemistry, even in confrontation (which is most of the time), but their verbal exchanges and smart dialogue are really what distinguish this piece.  On paper, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" sounds like it might be a bit of a disaster.  It might be filled with cliches about mental illness and stock romantic subplots.  But Russell travels off the beaten path.  The movie speaks volumes about family and commitment with unexpected plot detours that include gambling, football, and even competitive dancing.Every character in the movie is a mess!  Really!  But you still root for them to come together.  Cooper shows new acting chops, while Lawrence is smart and appealing.  DeNiro has one of his best supporting roles in years, he's playing an actual character and not just a caricature of himself.  His estrangement with Cooper fuels much of the movie.  The saintly Weaver is so good, worlds away from her Oscar nominated turn in ""Animal Kingdom"" as the evil matriarch.  And Ortiz and Tucker really score in smaller roles.  The movie might follow standard romantic comedy conventions in its primary plot, but you've never seen them orchestrated in quite this way.

He now finds himself living back with his mother and father after spending eight months is a state institution on a plea bargain. Pat is determined to rebuild his life, remain positive and reunite with his wife, despite the challenging circumstances of their separation. All Pat's parents want is for him to get back on his feet - and to share their family's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles football team. When Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both of their lives.The cast led by Bradley Cooper (solidly impressive, Oscar-nominated as Pat) (also executive produced), Jennifer Lawrence (in another impressively crafted, Oscar-winning performance as Tiffany), Robert De Niro (Oscar-nominated superb as Pat Sr.), Jacki Weaver (Oscar-nominated solid as Dolores) & Chris Tucker (also solid as Danny) is brilliant.

The first twenty minutes had me cringing in shared pain with Cooper's character, and I didn't know if I could take too much more.

He holds his own with DeNiro, and Bob is as good as he's been in years, so that's a high bar.

It is not romanticized but, rather, looked at ""full scope"" with affects on not only the protagonist with the disorder but upon family and friends.  The roots of the pathology is shown clearly through the father's obsessions and emotions, played authentically, sensitively and well by Robert DeNiro.  The inside jokes of the BPD couple are so familiar and the edge upon which those with BPD reside excellently portrayed.I would recommend this film not for an easy viewing or a heartwarming touch but for the as-accurate-as-Hollywood-can-get-it picture of what it is like to live with Bi-Polar Disorder.  There are many living with this illness everyday - I, for one, felt a kinship and some comfort with this film.

I went into this movie with such high hopes and enthusiasm and came out feeling a bit cheated. Thank Goodness my movie date was all that I had hoped for or the afternoon would have been a disappointment.After hearing so much about  this move, I anxiously went to see it. I'm not sure why there was so much Bravo's about it.  I came out of the movie not as impressed as I had hoped. Its a flick about a dysfunctional  family and  a  their emotionally disturbed son who  has been court ordered to spend some time in  mental institute after beating his ex wife's lover.  Pat, played by Bradly Cooper plays the part of a man who had a break down due to his wife cheating on him and was sent to a mental institution  for his anger and bipolar issues.  Upon his release, he get to return home to his parents home with the condition he stays away from his ex wife and continue his out patient treatment care.Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, is emotionally disturbed in her way, yet functional in the real world had the most strength in this movie. She played her part as a tuff cookie kinda gal who doesn't give a hoot about what others think or say, and develops feelings for Bradly Cooper.Robert DeNiro plays his father and Jackie Weaver plays his mother, or should  I say was that  Salley Struthers?  Upon  Bradly Cooper's return to his parents house, everyone seems to be walking on egg shells.  The only responsibility Pat seems to have as an adult  is to jog around  the streets in hopes to keep his head clear, and take  his meds. The one thing that seems to motivate him to stay focused is the thought of being able to speak to his wife once again and hoping to woo her back into his arms. His parents afraid to speak their minds in fear of triggering off the unstable jogger are walking around on egg shells afraid to approach him with many matters. Robert DeNiro, a football fan wants to spend time with his son  sitting and watching  the game on the television, but he son hasn't a interest in this, the son is  more  interested in jogging around the streets wrapped in a hefty garbage bag passing his ex wife's house in hopes to get a glimpse of her.  Jacki Weaver seems to  have not much to say in this movie she just kinda stands around with a look of constant turmoil and confusion on her face.  During Pats jog, this is where he runs constantly into Tiffany who jogs with him. They first  meet and show no interested at first..  As they get to know each other, Tiffany  woos him in by asking him to be enter a dance contest with her, in return, she will get a letter to his ex wife with out he courts knowing about it. Things start to take a turn from there on in,  DeNiro starts believing in his son recovery and puts his money where his mouth is and bets on the football game. Tiffany starts believing in Pat's recovery and put her heart where her mouth it and enters them both in  a dancing contest. Jackie Weaver, well, Im not sure what she belived in, but I believe she was Sally Struthers in a past life.This movie was weak in many areas, but what I did like about it was the fact that it attempted to show how  many dysfunctional family there really are in this world. Sometimes life doesn't always have touch downs. We fumble, tackle each other, call time outs and on a good day, huddle around each other, but at the end of the day we are all on the same team.",2,FUMBLED!,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,3468,"['Was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'touch', 'was', 'expecting', 'Someone', 'may', 'have', 'fumbled', 'one', 'went', 'movie', 'such', 'high', 'hopes', 'enthusiasm', 'came', 'out', 'feeling', 'bit', 'cheated', 'Thank', 'Goodness', 'movie', 'date', 'was', 'had', 'hoped', 'afternoon', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disappointment.After', 'hearing', 'so', 'much', 'move', 'anxiously', 'went', 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'Bravo', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'impressed', 'had', 'hoped', 'flick', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'son', 'who', 'been', 'court', 'ordered', 'spend', 'time', 'mental', 'institute', 'beating', 'ex', 'wife', 'lover', 'Pat', 'played', 'Bradly', 'Cooper', 'part', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'break', 'down', 'due', 'wife', 'cheating', 'was', 'sent', 'mental', 'institution', 'anger', 'bipolar', 'issues', 'release', 'get', 'return', 'home', 'parents', 'home', 'condition', 'away', 'ex', 'wife', 'continue', 'out', 'patient', 'treatment', 'care.Tiffany', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'way', 'yet', 'functional', 'real', 'world', 'had', 'most', 'strength', 'movie', 'played', 'part', 'tuff', 'cookie', 'kinda', 'gal', 'who', ""n't"", 'give', 'hoot', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'say', 'feelings', 'Bradly', 'Cooper.Robert', 'DeNiro', 'father', 'Jackie', 'Weaver', 'mother', 'should', 'say', 'was', 'Salley', 'Struthers', 'Bradly', 'Cooper', 'return', 'parents', 'house', 'everyone', 'be', 'walking', 'egg', 'shells', 'only', 'responsibility', 'Pat', 'have', 'adult', 'jog', 'streets', 'hopes', 'keep', 'head', 'clear', 'take', 'meds', 'one', 'thing', 'motivate', 'stay', 'focused', 'thought', 'being', 'able', 'speak', 'wife', 'once', 'again', 'hoping', 'woo', 'back', 'arms', 'parents', 'afraid', 'speak', 'minds', 'fear', 'triggering', 'off', 'unstable', 'jogger', 'are', 'walking', 'around', 'egg', 'shells', 'afraid', 'approach', 'many', 'matters', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'football', 'fan', 'spend', 'time', 'son', 'sitting', 'watching', 'game', 'television', 'son', ""n't"", 'interest', 'son', 'more', 'interested', 'jogging', 'streets', 'wrapped', 'hefty', 'garbage', 'bag', 'passing', 'ex', 'wife', 'house', 'hopes', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'have', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'movie', 'just', 'kinda', 'stands', 'look', 'constant', 'turmoil', 'confusion', 'face', 'Pats', 'jog', 'where', 'constantly', 'Tiffany', 'who', 'jogs', 'first', 'meet', 'show', 'interested', 'first..', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'Tiffany', 'woos', 'asking', 'be', 'enter', 'dance', 'contest', 'return', 'will', 'get', 'letter', 'ex', 'wife', 'knowing', 'Things', 'start', 'take', 'turn', 'there', 'DeNiro', 'believing', 'son', 'recovery', 'money', 'where', 'mouth', 'bets', 'football', 'game', 'Tiffany', 'believing', 'Pat', 'recovery', 'put', 'heart', 'where', 'mouth', 'dancing', 'contest', 'Jackie', 'Weaver', 'well', 'Im', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'belived', 'believe', 'was', 'Sally', 'Struthers', 'past', 'life.This', 'movie', 'was', 'weak', 'many', 'areas', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'fact', 'attempted', 'show', 'how', 'many', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'really', 'are', 'world', 'Sometimes', 'life', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'touch', 'downs', 'fumble', 'tackle', 'other', 'call', 'time', 'outs', 'good', 'day', 'huddle', 'other', 'end', 'day', 'are', 'same', 'team']",Silver Linings Playbook

First off, I am a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence and that was exciting in itself. The movie was hilarious, witty, charming, crazy, confusing and in all good ways. Robert Dinero oddly made me cry of course. The overall story was amazing. Love does not always come like in fairy tales and this movie proves that. Sometimes the pain can bring two people together, and sometimes the people we need the most are right in front of us, even if we cannot see it right away.

The dialogue is sharp, witty, insightful, funny, and often brutally honest. It respects and holds true affection for its characters and the wonderful ensemble cast makes it look easy. The direction, editing and soundtrack are spot on. It is a future classic and the best movie of the year.""- I would add that this is a movie maker's movie, a brilliant production from top down and bottom up with powerful riveting performances by the lovely and bit scary Jennifer Lawrence, talented Bradley Cooper, Robert DiNero and Jacki Weaver along with the rest of the cast. The director David O Russell has done a great job translating this book into film; I'm always amazed at people with such talent. I use the word scary to describe the young, attractive Ms.Lawrence as this is the second time I've been impressed by her powerful performance as an actress the first being her superb role in ""Winters Bone"".

It did NOT actually have too much drama, which I was dreading, or a sappy ending, which I was also dreading. Instead, the story unfolded much like real life events, although his therapist being so cool was a little hard to believe. Still, it worked, and so did the whole dance thingy - Chris Tucker as Danny was a nice touch. I really liked his character. I found myself caring about and liking everyone in the film, including the police officer, and Pat's dad. No great epiphanies, no violent endings... Just a good story about ordinary people trying to make sense of extraordinary events. The flow was so natural and organic that you feel like you had a hidden camera in these people's lives. And ""the kiss"" won MTV's ""Best Kiss"" award, and for good reason.

If you have a particular favorite genre you usually lean that direction. If you hear from a friend you might use that to decide. Most of us rarely step out of our comfort zone though. Make a decision to do that tonight and rent SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK.Forget the cover or ads, this is not a romantic comedy. There is romance and there are some funny moments, but the heart of this film revolves around mental illness. Not in the usual depressing sort of way but in a way that opens up discussion about the topic and that makes you realize you can have problems but still find hope.Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a bipolar sufferer whose mother gets him released from a mental institution after 8 months inside. Pat went there after he returned home early one day to find his wife in the shower with a colleague and attacking him. This was the trigger that brought about the realization that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.Once home we get a glimpse of where Pat's problems may have begun. His father Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro) is a book operator who is slightly OCD to say the least. Problems in the past between son and father are history but at the same time affect much of what happens in the present. Trying to rebuild bridges and solve those problems makes up part of this story.Pat is trying to change his life all in the hopes of getting back with his ex-wife, who has a restraining order out against him. He runs, works out and is reading the syllabus of books she recommends to her students. She wanted him to lose weight, to be better read and to find a way to enjoy life. Now he's trying in hopes of their reuniting.Pat's friend Ronnie invites him to dinner and there introduces him to his wife's sister, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). Tiffany has problems of her own with her husband having died a few months earlier and having just lost her job.  The two seem at first to but heads but eventually a friendship begins to flourish when Tiffany suddenly shows up to run alongside Pat while he jogs.As a bond slowly forms between the two and friendship blossoms, Pat remains focused on his ex-wife.  Tiffany continues to try and build on their friendship, eventually agreeing to get a letter to Pat's ex in return for one favor. She wants him to help her by being her dance partner in a ballroom dancing competition. Pat agrees, anything to bring his ex back.The nice part about this film is the chemistry between the two actors in the leads as well as the supporting cast that surrounds them. There isn't a wasted moment of film used in the telling of this story and you find yourself rooting not only for the main characters but everyone involved here. The icing on the cake is the slow development of the characters rather than the rushed feeling most movies present these days. Instead of Pat or Tiffany suddenly becoming a different ball of emotions, their changes develop as the story unfolds making it a more complete and realistic film.The charm of this film is that you can't help but love these characters as portrayed because they seem so real. You want the best for them, you want them to succeed and until the final moments of the film you're just not quite sure if that will happen or not. It also provides a platform to leap from if there is someone with a mental illness in your real life. The topic has always seemed taboo but films like this will make it easier to approach someone or to open up and say ""I have a problem.""The highest praise I can offer for this film is to say I think it should have taken the Oscar for best picture. It is a movie I felt like I could sit back and watch all over again just as soon as it finished.

1572710,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B008OGIPJA,maskirovka,"[28, 40]","This movie adaptation did not touch my heart the same way the book ""The Silver Linings Playbook"" did.  But I still find myself giving it five stars because its occasionally noticeable flaws are outshone by its virtues.The protagonist is Pat. He's a former high school history teacher and coach (as well as a bipolar disorder sufferer) who went a bit crazy after ""something"" went wrong with his marriage. That something landed him in a mental hospital as part of a plea bargain. We meet him the day his doting and loving mother gets him discharged from the facility. Pat is touchingly and sometimes even maddeningly naive about the chances of renewing his marriage with his wife Nikki. Like many people (including me), he's been conditioned by Hollywood and popular culture to expect a happy ending to the ""movie"" his life seems to be to him.But Pat should have remembered that sometimes the happy ending that you think you want is not the ending you are going to get and the one you get is much better than the one you want. The ""twist"" in his life-movie plot comes in the form of a young widow named Tiffany who is struggling to overcome her own personal demons. Somehow, grudgingly, Pat becomes friends with her and then something more along the way...I won't say more than that, except to say the story has an immensely uplifting ending that put a smile on my face.This odd love story unfolds in Philadelphia and against the backdrop of the NFL season. Pat, like his brother and father, is a rabid Eagles fan and a great deal of the story delves in what that means to love a team so much. Suffice to say that even though I'm from Washington DC (go Redskins!) it made me want to go see the Eagles play and root for them to be part of the Eagles fandom brotherhood for just a moment (so long as it wasn't a game with the Redskins).There are three things about this story that stand out to me as being particularly praise-worthy.1.  Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely luminous as Tiffany.  She may have been a bit young to play the role of someone who was in their mid-to-late 20s, but she was so beautiful, sad, and compelling, I was more than willing to suspend disbelief on that part (and besides some people do look much younger than their actual ages...and a thirty-five year old being involved with a 21 year old may be uncommon but it's hardly deviant).2. Dr. ""Cliff"" Patel (Pat's therapist) is a great supporting character...especially when he reveals that he too is an ardent Eagles fan.3. The depiction of serious mental illness like that Pat suffers (and to a lesser extent Tiffany) is not sugar-coated but not portrayed in an ugly way that might repel the viewer. The scene where Pat has a major episode and winds up scuffling with his parents is well done and heart-breaking.So how did the movie and novel differ from each other?&lt;spoilers>I think most of the changes were driven by the need to keep the story moving along and prevent the movie from getting too long.  I only think the ones that made the movie a little less compelling than the book were items 1, 2, 3, and 4 below.1.  The movie ended with the Tiffany and Pat professing their love for each other at the end of the dance competition, instead of lying down on a snowy field to watch for clouds and saying that they needed each other (vice ""loved"").  I actually liked the book ending better, but I suppose the movie had a more Hollywood ending simply because Hollywood knows what sells.2.  Nikki did not come to the dance recital in the book, but Pat did have his brother drive him past the house where she was living with her new husband and family and seeing them happy, Pat realized his marriage was truly over and that he didn't want to bother or bother with Nikki anymore.  I think that would have made a better resolution than what the movie did.3.  Pat's family was not Italian-American in the book.  I didn't mind this change, but I wished that they had played down the ""lovable noisy Italian American family"" cliche some.  All the people yelling at each other got slightly annoying.4.  Pat exchanged more letters with what he thought was his wife Nikki in the book and contrary to the movie, he did not find out that the letters were fake until Tiffany told him they were.  These letters and the ones Tiffany wrote him under her own name shed a lot of useful light on Tiffany and how she felt about Pat.5.  Pat and Tiffany did not go to the beach with their friends in the movie.6.  Pat's father in the book did not have his own problems with low level OCD but was simply somewhat withdrawn from his family although he did love Pat and his wife.7.  The Eagles games featured more prominently in the book.8.  Pat's father was not a bookie in the book and did not make any bets about the outcome of the game with the Cowboys or the dance competition with his friend.9.  The dance that Pat and Tiffany did in the book was more a modern dance than ballroom, and they did better in the book than the movie.10.  The scene in the book where Pat got in a fight at an Eagles game was somewhat different than what the movie showed.  Pat did not get arrested.11.  Pat did not get mugged and his leg broken in the movie like he did in the book.12.  They used different songs in the movie and book as the song from Pat and Nikki's wedding that was playing when he caught his wife cheating on him.13.  Pat's mother did not go ""on strike"" to try to change Pat's father's behavior in the movie like she did in the book.14.  Unlike in the book, Pat did not blot out the reason why he wound up in a mental hospital in the movie.15.  Pat was in the mental hospital for four years in the book and was hazy about how long he had been there (somewhat deliberately).  In the movie, he had been away for eight months and knew that.16.  While the movie showed Pat as working hard to lose weight and get in great shape for the sake his hoped for reunion with Nikki, it was not done to quite the same degree as in the book.&lt;end spoilers>So I would say see the movie and read the book...both are worthwhile, but it's the book that will stay with me more.Finally, those who like this book/movie probably will like ""Ordinary People,"" another story that also deals with family tragedy and mental illness but is similarly uplifting with some romantic elements.Ordinary PeopleOrdinary People",5,Not quite as good as the book

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 1]","I really wanted to like SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK and, for the most part, I did...primarily because of the performances of the actors...rather than the screenplay, which I felt was overlong, often convoluted and forced.(I realize that I hold a minority opinion here.  Even my wife disagrees with me, but I have to call `em as I see `em.)From a positive standpoint, this film probably has the finest ensemble cast of 2012.  Jennifer Lawrence certainly deserved her ""Best Actress"" Oscar, and it's a shame that Bradley Cooper had to be up the same year as Daniel Day-Lewis' ""Abraham Lincoln"".  His performance grabbed me from the opening scene and held me throughout.  Jackie Weaver is quietly marvelous as Cooper's mother, and as his book-making father, Robert DeNiro delivers his finest performance in years.The film opens with Cooper being released into the custody of his parents, after spending eight months in a state mental institution, the result of a plea bargain.  He had come home from work one day to find his wife in the shower with another man, so like any other red-blooded husband, he beat the crap out of the guy.Cooper is determined to put his life back together and win back his wife, even though she has a restraining order against him.  Then, he meets Jennifer Lawrence, a young widow with her own set of problems, and they develop an initially disquieting relationship.For the first half hour or so, director-screenwriter David O. Russell creates an entertaining dramedy with SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, as we meet Cooper and his dysfunctional family, then awhile later, Lawrence.  The dynamics between all of these characters remains engrossing for most of the picture, but after the introductions and initial encounters, Russell, who adapted the novel by Matthew Quick, does not seem to know how to develop the action in a believable manner.  Part of the problem is that there are too many secondary, albeit well-played, characters in this film resulting in the screenplay occasionally losing its focus.The final twenty minutes of the movie, involving a large bet on a football game and a dance contest, does not ring true, nor does the scene leading up to it.Nevertheless, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a movie worth seeing, if for no other reason than the actors, all of who are extremely likable.The Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains many extras, including several deleted scenes, ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, one of which involves a close look at the dance rehearsals between Cooper and Lawrence.

It's not an examination of mental health nor an attempt to diminish or sanctify bipolarism.  I never found the treatment of mental illness funny in this film; in fact, the scenes involving Pat's breakdowns were disturbing and Danny's illness was sadly touching because he accepted his condition and its varying consequences.  The plot has been well discussed in many effective posts so no need to reiterate here.I didn't have a strong desire to see this movie so my enjoyment surprised me.  And the main reason for my enjoyment is the superb casting.  Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Tiffany, as she was in WINTERS BONE, my first exposure to her talents.  She effortlessly embodies Tiffany's persona to create a multi-layered character you can't help liking.  Bradley Cooper is equally stunning as Pat, a performance I hadn't expected.  He too makes his troubled character irresistibly appealing.Robert DeNiro hasn't been this good in years and Jacki Weaver is perfect as Pat's mom.

1572742,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B008OGIPJA,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a romantic dramedy adapted from the book of the same name by Matthew Quick. David O. Russell wrote the screenplay and directs. Pat Solitano, Jr. (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from a psychiatric hospital, where he spent some time after severely beating his wife's lover. He immediately vows to win back the affections of his estranged wife Nikki, against the advice of his bookmaking father (Robert De Niro) and headstrong mother (Jackie Weaver). When Pat is introduced to Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of a friend, sparks fly, as she is recently widowed with some problems of her own. Tiffany proposes that she help Pat contact Nikki -if he will be her competitive dance partner in return.David O. Russell chose this material, because it made mental illness, specifically bipolar disorder, accessible. And Pat is not the only one afflicted. Tiffany dealt with her husband's death with pathological behavior. Pat's father has a minor obsessive-compulsive disorder. Danny (Chris Tucker), a friend from the hospital, has drug problems and a constant battle over the legal status of his hospitalization. It's a menagerie of personality problems. I'm not sure that any of these characters are quite believable, but the film doesn't try to pass dysfunction off as quirkiness, a common ploy in independent film. It takes a matter-of-fact but sympathetic approach to the characters' problems. Pat's struggle to deal with his impulses makes him sympathetic.The film glosses over, or even advocates, some very bad behavior, however. Pat is bipolar, but Tiffany's problems are more troubling. Tiffany reacts to situations in which she feels uncomfortable by accusing innocent men of sexual harassment. She does this once and alludes to it a second time. She repeatedly lies to Pat about things that are important to him and sees nothing wrong with toying with others' emotions for her own gratification. None of this is presented in a negative light. In fact, we are supposed to celebrate Tiffany's self-acceptance. But making unfounded accusations is not acceptable. Jennifer Lawrence is an appealing actress, and that white-washes the character. She makes Tiffany's frankness seem charming, which it is in some contexts, but Tiffany has no concept of right and wrong, and she doesn't have psychosis to blame. She's the last person with whom a bipolar individual should be involved.The DVD (Anchor Bay 2013): Bonus features include 17 deleted scenes. There is a meandering featurette called ""Silver Linings Playbook: The Movie That Became a Movement"" (29 min), which features interviews with director David O. Russell, author Matthew Quick, the cast, some psychiatrists, and composer Danny Elfman.

1572748,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008OGIPJA,M. Oleson,"[2, 4]","There may be spoilers.There is plenty to admire in this David O. Russell film beginning with the performances.  Somehow Russell manages to skim the surface of traditional dark comedy but never truly allows the story to sink.  This is mostly because Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are perfect romantic foils as Tiffany and Pat.Both are emotionally and psychologically damaged.  Pat Solitano (Cooper) is released from 6 months of hospitalization for criminally aggressive behavior.  After catching his wife (Brea Bee) in the shower with a fellow teacher, he nearly kills the guy.  Treatment rather than jail seemed like his only viable option.  After his mother (Jacki Weaver) gets him out, he refuses to take his meds, for all the usual reasons (they make me drowsy, incoherent, etc.)At a dinner at his best friend's house he meets Tiffany, his friend's sister-in-law.  She has her own issues including promiscuity following her husband death.  He was a police officer.  Evidently, many of her friends at work were more than willing to take advantage of Tiffany's emotional weakness.  While there is always awkwardness between the two, Pat and Tiffany make a pact to help each other.Pat still believes he has a future with his now estranged wife, restraining order notwithstanding.  Tiffany needs a dance partner at an upcoming contest.  Tiffany agrees to deliver a letter to the wife if Pat will be her partner.  An excellent screenplay by Matthew M. Quick provides some great lines and humorous zingers for both leads.  In one of his best roles in recent memory, Robert De Niro gives a wonderful (and Oscar-worthy) performance as Pat, Sr., himself full of Philadelphia Eagles hysteria, superstition and acute compulsive disorder.Perhaps what makes this movie different from a traditional romantic comedy is that the film is believable.  Things aren't always pretty.  While improvements in the character's lives are there, they come in small steps.  When the film ends everything isn't perfect.  For example, when the couple goes to the dance contest at the end of the film, the final dance move involves Tiffany running toward Pat, who is to lift her above his head.  They have had problems with this move in practice.  We expect the move to work as we have seen in hundreds of other movies.  Here, just like in practice, Tiffany's crotch lands right in Pat's face.  Both Lawrence and Cooper manage to keep in the same character throughout the film.  Even as they take baby steps, they aren't cured at the end.  This is a solid, smart, award-worth film.",5,4 1/2 stars for one of the best films of 2012,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,2560,"['may', 'be', 'plenty', 'admire', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'film', 'beginning', 'performances', 'Somehow', 'Russell', 'skim', 'surface', 'traditional', 'dark', 'comedy', 'never', 'truly', 'story', 'sink', 'mostly', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'are', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'foils', 'Tiffany', 'Pat.Both', 'are', 'emotionally', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'Pat', 'Solitano', 'Cooper', 'released', '6', 'months', 'hospitalization', 'criminally', 'aggressive', 'behavior', 'catching', 'wife', 'Brea', 'Bee', 'shower', 'fellow', 'teacher', 'nearly', 'guy', 'Treatment', 'rather', 'jail', 'seemed', 'only', 'viable', 'option', 'mother', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'out', 'take', 'meds', 'usual', 'reasons', 'make', 'drowsy', 'incoherent', 'etc', 'dinner', 'best', 'friend', 'house', 'Tiffany', 'friend', 'sister-in-law', 'own', 'issues', 'including', 'promiscuity', 'following', 'husband', 'death', 'was', 'police', 'officer', 'Evidently', 'many', 'friends', 'work', 'were', 'more', 'willing', 'take', 'advantage', 'Tiffany', 'emotional', 'weakness', 'always', 'awkwardness', 'two', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'make', 'pact', 'help', 'other.Pat', 'still', 'future', 'now', 'estranged', 'wife', 'restraining', 'order', 'notwithstanding', 'Tiffany', 'dance', 'partner', 'upcoming', 'contest', 'Tiffany', 'deliver', 'letter', 'wife', 'Pat', 'will', 'be', 'partner', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'Matthew', 'M.', 'Quick', 'great', 'lines', 'humorous', 'zingers', 'leads', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'recent', 'memory', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'wonderful', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Pat', 'Sr.', 'full', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'hysteria', 'superstition', 'acute', 'compulsive', 'disorder.Perhaps', 'what', 'movie', 'different', 'traditional', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'film', 'believable', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'pretty', 'improvements', 'character', 'lives', 'are', 'there', 'come', 'small', 'steps', 'When', 'film', 'everything', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'example', 'when', 'couple', 'dance', 'contest', 'end', 'film', 'final', 'dance', 'move', 'Tiffany', 'running', 'Pat', 'who', 'lift', 'head', 'have', 'had', 'problems', 'move', 'practice', 'expect', 'move', 'work', 'have', 'seen', 'hundreds', 'other', 'movies', 'Here', 'just', 'practice', 'Tiffany', 'crotch', 'right', 'Pat', 'face', 'Lawrence', 'Cooper', 'manage', 'keep', 'same', 'character', 'film', 'Even', 'take', 'baby', 'steps', 'are', ""n't"", 'cured', 'end', 'solid', 'smart', 'award-worth', 'film']",Silver Linings Playbook

Then again, I despise The Hangover and look at how well that does, so perhaps Bradley Cooper pulls 'em in. It's about a rather unlikeable guy and his incredibly OCD father who obsesses over sports. Maybe that is also why I didn't care for this film and I'm being biased? If you are looking for a rom-com, I would say this fits that bill. If you like a guy who seems prickish for a good 3/4ths of the movie before redeeming himself in some manner - by all means add this to your queue.

Pat Sr. is played with sharp authenticity by Robert De Niro and his wife Dolores (Aussie Jacki Weaver) is the warmhearted caregiver who somehow knows how to keep the rabble in reasonable order.The film contains a unique balance with self-provoked anxiety causing Pat collapses, his actions and those who care for him a source of raucous humour and the realisation love can be lost and found, which all combines to present a well-paced, tightly constructed and highly entertaining movie.Nicholas R.W.

1572779,A237RLQXTL55RG,B008OGIPJA,off the tropic,"[4, 6]","David O. Russell brings a deeply human dimension to this odd tale of two souls desperately living on the fringes. The tale centers on Pat's (Bradley Cooper) determination to reconcile with his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee), despite the impossibility of that ideal and the valiant effort. As Pat goes through an exhausting course of attempting to salvage the last remnants of his failed marriage he is not always ""present"" in the moment, to notice the virtues of the people around him trying in vain to keep up with his highs and lows. This is especially noticeable when Pat chooses to open up to an unexpected friend, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who is also impossible to keep up with, and hardly notices her love and concern during his obsessive search for reconciliation with his wife.Even if the lives of Pat and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) are in a tail-spin when we are introduced to them, their meeting becomes a promising occasion for allaying the chaos in their lives. But in an impulsive moment (or is it cold, and calculated) a quid pro quo deal is struck between them that promises to unhinge, rather than sustain, harmony in their lives. We  see the makings of a tragedy of two doomed people attracted to each other for all the wrong reasons. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" begins with these premonitions of high tragedy.But it is surprising, even magical, when the movie becomes a beautiful, even consoling, illustration of a tale of hopelessness with a ""silver lining"". The story portends tragedy and chaos but there is also transcendence, this powerful will in the two central characters to overcome failure, misunderstandings, and impossible losses. The real power of the film was its success in conveying the experience of sheer exhileration that accompanies those moments of insight in the lives of Tiffany and Pat as they struggle to transcend their circumstances with relentless optimism.The emotional richness of the story has everything to do with the strange world of Tiffany and Pat. The freshness of the story unsettles all expectations. These off-beat characters have their kin in Hollywood history, from Frank Mackey in Anderson's Magnolia, to Ricky Fitts and Angela Hayes in Mendes's American Beauty. The pitch of the emotional drama of some of the scenes in Russell's film reminded me of the greatest scenes in the most trenchant melodramas made in the last couple of decades. The expressiveness of Pat and Tiffany together has an edginess to it that is a reminder of those brilliant scenes between Fitts and Hayes in the landmark Sam Mendes film. David O. Russell, an impressive director when he is at his best (See his Three Kings for instance) has the deft hand to transform the element of grotesque in the tale into a deeply human one.This movie embraces and shirks realism. Wounded characters miraculously transcend their circumstances. We are not quite sure where the psychological realism ends and the surreal begins. We are immersed in the psychological mayhem of the life of Tiffany and Pat one minute, and the next minute they are singing praises of each other. The film manages to put a perspective to the surfeit of realism as it hangs over the veil of romantic fantasy to keep the psychological chaos of these characters at just that right remove. The film suspends the unsettling reality of these lost lives at just that right ""cinematic"" distance to keep our attention on what is a genuinely moving human drama developing around the tumultuous ups and downs of  two young lives.Inspired acting from two eminently watchable actors in Hollywood: Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper breathes much of the life into this film. The charisma of these stars make their characters watchable. Both of them succeed early and well in bringing a sympathetic dimension to their wayward characters. Cooper and Lawrence are the backbone of the story until the last energetic frame of the film, even if Robert DeNiro as Pat's obsessive compulsive father and the poignant  and long suffering presence of Jacki Weaver as Pat's mother, tempers and renders meaning to a story that threatens to become one full of sound and fury signifying nothing.The scene with Pat reading, or devouring, Hemingway with intense interest is at once touching and comic. When Pat, in one of his many bouts of frenzy, retreats into this book he is deflated to find Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms end on a tragic note. In stinging protest he admonishes Hemingway's masochistic  streak. Pat is livid about the novel's unnecessary tragic ending. He flings out that book through the window of his attic rejecting the tragic sense of life in that novel. This form of art does the disservice of mindlessly courting the sad endings he is come to experience in life. This scene alerts the audience that the director may be setting us up for an ending that is a subversion of the tragic ending. The meaning of the title of the movie is for the first time brought up memorably.But a counter-argument is soon set up to Pat's critique of the novel. The tragic wisdom set up by Hemingway has an admirer. Pat's view of art is expanded as that counter-argument comes in the form of a letter from an admirer. It is worth seeing this film to find out who this admirer is and what the source of that tragic wisdom is. It will serve to illustrate how a ""silver lining"" plays out in Pat and Tiffany's increasingly convoluted and dangerous playbook of life.David O. Russell resurrects the poetics of loss in ""Silver Linings Playbook"", which is a much needed reprisal of themes that were the subject of  P.T. Anderson's Magnolia (1999), Paul Haggis's Crash (2005), and Alejandro Inarittu's 21 Grams. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a film that subverts the ending of these notable recent tragedies on film with a brilliant twist.

1572780,A26LD9FQHTM8ZH,B008OGIPJA,OlyNomad,"[1, 1]","The most frustrating thing about this movie for me was the thought of how good it could have been if they left out all the Hollywood clich&eacute;s, especially when it came to the lead female role (of course she likes beer, thinks sex with women is hot, and does one of the most overdone Hollywood moves of slapping the man across the face).Also, if you are like me and have a family member with mental illness and you've dealt with the reality of this...you really need to separate that reality and how this movie portrays mental illness in order to enjoy the movie.  If you are able to do that, the movie is enjoyable to watch.  I do not see at all though how it was considered award-worthy.  I expected so much more from it because I read of all the awards but when I watched it I couldn't figure out what about it deserved an award. If they would have had the conviction to make the movie about mental illness and put more emotional depth and honesty into it, I could understand awards.  But this movie didn't go there, it was mental illness light complete with Hollywood ending.  I like Jennifer Lawrence, but I didn't think her acting was anything special in this role.  I felt it stayed on the surface a little too much, but it's also a matter of that's what the script called for.  I think she would have been capable of going a lot deeper in a believable way if the script had called for that but it didn't.If you are offended by foul language, this has plenty of it.  Minimal sex/nudity...nothing to make a person squirm.

He has lost everything: his wife, his house, basically his life. He moves in with his parents (played by Robert de Niro and Jacki Weaver), determined to win back the graces of his wife, whatever it takes. Then by chance, he meets Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence), the younger sister of a family friend. Tiffany has plently of her own troubles. Since there is a restraining order against him, Pat cannot approach his wife directly, so he asks Jennifer to deliver a letter to his wife. Tiffany agrees but only if he does something in return, namely to be her dancing partner in a dancing competition she desperately wants to enter. Pat agrees. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience. Will Pat reunite with his wife? Or will he fall for Tiffany? You'll just have to see it for yourself.Several comments: this almost feels like two movies into one, as the first hour of the movie centers around the difficult readjustment Pat needs to make in the real world after his release and still dealing with his bipolar condition. It is difficult to like the Pat character because it is difficult to like the outbursts and ups-and-downs of someone being bipolar. In the second hour of the movie, the centers shifts towards the interplay between the Pat and Tiffany characters and the movie then becomes more of a rom-com. Yet it all works just great. One of the biggest surprises for me in this movie is the performance of Jennifer Lawrence (yes, she of ""The Hunger Games""), who brings an astonishing turn with an emotional depth that blows away anything she has done before, that girl can act! But the other performances are top notch too, certainly Bradley Cooper but check out De Niro in his best performance is YEARS. And oh yea, Philadelphia sports play a huge role in this movie, Eagles fans will love the many scenes set in Philadelphia and surrounding the Eagles.David Russell, who adopted the novel for the screen and directed this, certainly knows a thing or two about bringing dysfunctional families to the big screen (Spanking The Monkey; The Fighter, just to name those) and here he does it again, perhaps better than ever. This movie is already garning serious Oscar buzz, and it's easy to see why. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish.

I should know better than to dis this film, as most films I hate only draw comments from idiots. But for the sheer pleasure of it, I'll say this: I hated the writing, the acting (especially deNiro, who has been doing this same role for at least ten years and has apparently abandoned the use of his talent, and his wife-character), the characters themselves, the directing, the cinematography, the casting, the scenic design and the overall conception - where a ""silver lining"" is imposed on the story rather than grows out of it. I didn't find a single scene emotionally believable, felt the script demeaned mental illness, thought the film pandered to blacks, sports, dancing-with-the-stars fans, Philly itself, endorsed gambling, rewarded incredible stupidity and risk-taking (deNiro's character is willing to throw away his entire family's future based on nothing other than an idiotic hunch by a sexpot) while the film pretends to endorse other ""moral"" life choices, thought the entire film depended on ""cute"" writing and cliche (where plot is a substitute for canned laughter), and that it was predictable after the first ten minutes. By the way, the audience I was with, maybe 50 people, didn't laugh that much. What's not to hate? Over many years I've learned that many people often think something is funny if someone else tells them it's supposed to be. I'm not one. Now go ahead and trash me if you like.

The storyline had a great potential that was wasted. I also saw on the artwork of the disc that Jennifer Lawrence won 2012 Best Actress award. I wasn't surprised with that. Well deserved indeed.

Never falling into melodramatic, but straight to the point.The movie starts really slow and the initial part could have been shortened to give more space to the developing relationship of the main characters - particularly to the exchange of letters, which I believe is where the book should be doing better. Anyway, from the point where she reveals the circumstances of her husband's death (""That's a feeling"", indeed!), the story picks up and quickly starts revealing the beauty of that relationship.I particularly liked the scenes shown while playing ""Girl from the North Country"".

Tiffany is played by a 21 year old Jennifer Lawrence in a career defining performance...her Oscar was well deserved. In addition to trying to win back his wife, Pat also tries to mend fences with his father (played with usual excellence by Robert De Niro) who also has similar bipolar-type mental issues. Tiffany and Pat, through the medium of dance, help each other out...and the mutual assistance story becomes a love story...an exceptional love story. In addition to the principles, look for fine support performances from Jacki Weaver as Pat's mother; Julia Styles as Tiffany's sister, Veronica; and John Ortiz as Veronica's husband.

The movie is completely unbelievable, thoroughly self-conscious, insidiously manipulative, not funny, not romantic and the plot is as predictable as knowing who won this year's Super Bowl. Even the filming is utterly predictable: swirling cameras around happy couples, zooms in and out not where we'd least expect them - but where we have seen them a zillion times before.  And why is the acting being hosannaed to the heavens?  Bradley Cooper has no charisma whatsoever.  Jennifer Lawrence is bad girl boring.  Robert De Niro has been playing this exact same part forever and physically looks to be morphing into Tony Bennett.  And De Niro's wife - well, I thought it was Sally Struthers post-diet making a comeback - but it wasn't her - but whomever it was, all the actress did was stand around looking pole-axed.The way the makers of this movie try to push buttons is also both insulting and embarrassing. Characters of a distinctly politically correct nature make token appearances throughout - and what happened to the issue of bipolar disorder?  The film starts off as though it will be a rather serious study of the disorder with some comic overtones to lighten the intense issue a bit in order to make it more palatable for popular consumption - and then loses that theme a third of the way in and devolves into a trite and banal and, again, incredibly predictable love story.  One other recurring annoyance that threads through the whole affair - the characters don't really talk to or with one another.  They soliloquize.  They talk a tremendous lot, each making their script-heavy speeches - and that gets boring fast.  Some scenes seemed like they would never end.A last thing about this movie: Each time the main character took to jogging he would be wearing a garbage bag.  By the third or fourth time of seeing this I was so disgusted with the movie that I would have just loved to put the entire film into one big heavy-duty garbage bag!As for Oscar?  Well, Oscar has been pretty dumb down the years actually.  Most picks are not based on quality but on coffer control.  Many of the greatest movies ever made and the greatest performances have hardly been glanced upon by dear dumb Oscar.

1572843,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B008OGIPJA,RMurray847,"[6, 10]","SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a feel-good movie about mental illness.  It does an excellent job of showing folks who are just barely capable of living in society due to their various afflictions, but then it implies that just some peace, love and understanding are all that's really needed to push the problems away.We meet Pat (Bradley Cooper) as his mother (Jacki Weaver) is signing him out of an institution he has living in for the past 8 months.  He is, it would seem, severely bi-polar and but is obsessed with the idea of reuniting with his wife (who cheated on him and now has a restraining order against him, since he beat the snot out of the guy who cuckolded him).  To this end, he has developed a strategy of working out and of looking for the silver lining in bad situations.  He's trying to a) reshape his body, and apparently he has lost some weight & b) change his way of thinking.  He's able to stick with his running, but struggles a bit more with his internal life.  His illness has turned him into a deeply humorless person...everything that is said he either twists into being about him, or he doesn't listen to it if it isn't directly relevant to him.  He doesn't really joke or understand jokes.  Everyone is out to thwart what he's working on.  And heaven forbid anyone imply that he's not going to reunite with his wife...he's focused like a laser on that idea, and if something gets in his way, he either gets confused or lashes out in anger.His mother brings him home, where his father (Robert DeNiro) awaits.  This man has serious OCD, and is one of those sports fans who believes things like the way he holds his remote control can affect the outcome of his beloved Philadelphia sports games.  He is also a small-time bookie who enjoys making bets himself.  His is a modest tyrant of his household, thus making everyone a slave to his compulsions.  He isn't quite as overtly ill as his son, but that may be because he has more years of living with his illness under his belt.One day, Pat is introduced to Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a volatile young widow with some fairly serious issues of her own to overcome.  She has recently lost her job due to sleeping with EVERYONE in her office, and now she is somewhat adrift.  She latches on to Pat, and manipulates him into being her dance partner for an upcoming competition.The movie is HIGHLY entertaining.  Writer/director David O. Russell continues to show that he has a nice eye for middle-class, working-stiff neighborhoods (as in THE FIGHTER).  He's got a great ear for dialogue that his great cast can really chew into, and his directing style is unobtrusive.  I note this, because he CAN direct movies that have very strong visual flair (the fantastic THREE KINGS)...but that isn't needed for SILVER LININGS.  This is a character driven film.  It's a drama with plenty of comedy.  It's a romance with a minimum of saccharine.  I say minimum, because sadly, there is some in what I think is a far too neat and tidy ending.  The movie spends so much time showing how untidy and messy the lives of all these characters are, and it betrays that very carefully developed understanding. I assume the movie has the same ending as the book it was based on.The real fun of the film IS the performances...watching these actors tear into the great dialogue.  Bradley Cooper has never been one of my favorites.  He's often very smug and self-satisfied in a way that seems to be more about him than his characters.  But here, he's brought a bit down to earth, and is thus quite effective.  While I don't agree with the Oscar-buzz I've been hearing about him, he is very good.  I DO agree with the buzz about Jennifer Lawrence.  With this film, THE HUNGER GAMES and WINTER'S BONE, there need no longer be any debate about her versatility and value...she is one of the top young actresses of the day.  Now all she needs is a flat-out comedy or farce, and she'll have tackled everything.  And Robert DeNiro is back!  For years now, he's been collecting paychecks by impersonating himself.  He was very funny in MEET THE PARENTS and ANALYSE THIS, but those roles seemed fresh and funny and self-effacing.  Then those roles were ALL he did.  Comedies where he played the Robert DeNiro character.  Or he'd do something like RIGHTEOUS KILL, a more serious movie that required him to do little more than glower and look menacing.  But Russell has gotten a serious, fully-rounded performance from him here, and he's great.  For me, a big DeNiro fan, that alone makes the movie worthwhile...to show that DeNiro still has the chops and the will to give a great performance.  I just hope he does more of this.  And Jacki Weaver, as the mom, is great as well.  She gives DeNiro a great character to play off of.Despite my reservations about the ending, I have no hesitancy in saying that this is a movie well-worth seeing.",4,4.5 stars.

However Pat's ex actually shows up and Tiffany figure's she will lose Pat after it is all over.She has a couple of vodka'sto stiffen her resolve and they both go on.They know they're entirely out of their league but they give it their best.The two receive a five rating and Pat's father's bet is won.Pat has a confidential word with his ex and Tiffany rushes off broken hearted.Pat catches up with her,as he obviously has told his ex he has fallen for Tiffany.The film ends as Pat and Tiffany are at Pat's home enjoying everyone's company,including their own.Pat is back on his meds and is doing fine.This is certainly a heart warming tale,on top of the obvious look into mental illness.One also sees many characteristics in other characters,especially Pat's father who definitely has OCD,that could apply to many of the viewers of this film.Mental illness can sometimes be a subjective thing.Lawrence nicely plays Tiffany as a hard nosed woman,who admits to a variety of dalliances in her past,who has many issues and almost becomes a stalker to poor Pat.And I must say I don't know who corralled,roped and hog tied Chris Tucker,but this is the most under played performance I have ever seen him give in ANY film.And I liked it immensely.I know Lawrence received a statue for her performance but....why? Cooper is the real and central star here and if anyone deserved an OSCAR it was him.But to tell the truth,I don't believe there was ANY OSCAR performances in this film at all.The Academy decisions re the handing out of their prizes has baffled me over and over again for many a year now.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette.All in all a delightful but quirky look at mental illness with a stellar cast.Highly recommended.4-4 1/2 stars.",4,A wonderful and quirky look at mental illness,1369612800,"05 27,

How often have we seen such attempts devolve into either freak show comedy or horror movie madness? ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the few to get it right. It's not that writer/director David O. Russell doesn't see the humor in the situations he's depicting - there are some very funny scenes in the movie - it's that he sees humor as just one small aspect of what turns out to be a far more complex and multi-layered condition.In a tour-de-force performance that finally put him on the map as an actor of extraordinary talent, Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a young man who suffers from a severe case of Bi-Polar Disorder, so severe that Pat has been spending the past few months since the dissolution of his marriage in an institution. But Pat has chosen to move back in with his parents, who work hard at trying to understand Pat's condition and to cope with his often bizarre and incomprehensible behavior. While he nurtures the fantasy that he will one day reunite with his estranged wife, Pat meets Tiffany, a local girl who seems to have as many issues as he does when it comes to functioning in the real world.""Silver Linings Playbook"" makes the not entirely novel case that all of us suffer from our share of personal quirks and idiosyncrasies - Pat's dad's superstitious obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles isn't too many steps away from the irrational concerns that dictate Pat's life - but that BPD just ratchets them up to a much higher level. The screenplay, which was adapted from the Matthew Quick novel, goes from the comical to the serious to the heartbreaking to the romantic without any noticeable grinding of tonal gears. Ditto for the nearly perfect ensemble cast which includes Robert De Niro as Pat's father, Jacki Weaver as his mom, and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, who won a Best Actress Oscar for her work.But it is Cooper who makes the movie his own. There is scarcely a moment when he does not appear on screen and the actor casts a spell over the audience from first frame to last. He avoids the role-given temptation to chew the scenery, opting instead for understatement in his portrayal of a man whose desire to fit into the world is often at odds with his ability to do so. The result is a performance that elicits both laughter and tears from the audience, but which never feels contrived or manipulative while doing so. He draws us so deeply into the core of the character that we even accept his potentially trite belief that one must look for the silver lining in even the darkest of clouds since, when you think about it, what alternative does one really have? It's a career- defining performance for an actor clearly concerned with making the most of his time in the spotlight.",4,A breakthrough performance by Bradley Cooper,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,2808,"['****1/2Dramatizing', 'mental', 'illness', 'always', 'been', 'tricky', 'proposition', 'movies', 'How', 'often', 'have', 'seen', 'such', 'attempts', 'devolve', 'freak', 'show', 'comedy', 'horror', 'movie', 'madness', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'one', 'few', 'get', 'right', 'not', 'writer/director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', ""n't"", 'see', 'humor', 'situations', 'depicting', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'humor', 'just', 'one', 'small', 'aspect', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'multi-layered', 'condition.In', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'finally', 'put', 'map', 'actor', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Pat', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'severe', 'case', 'Bi-Polar', 'Disorder', 'so', 'severe', 'Pat', 'been', 'spending', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'dissolution', 'marriage', 'institution', 'Pat', 'chosen', 'move', 'back', 'parents', 'who', 'work', 'hard', 'trying', 'understand', 'Pat', 'condition', 'cope', 'often', 'bizarre', 'incomprehensible', 'behavior', 'fantasy', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'reunite', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'local', 'girl', 'who', 'have', 'many', 'issues', 'when', 'functioning', 'real', 'world', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'not', 'entirely', 'novel', 'case', 'suffer', 'share', 'personal', 'quirks', 'idiosyncrasies', 'Pat', 'dad', 'superstitious', 'obsession', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'steps', 'away', 'irrational', 'concerns', 'dictate', 'Pat', 'life', 'BPD', 'just', 'up', 'much', 'higher', 'level', 'screenplay', 'was', 'adapted', 'Matthew', 'Quick', 'novel', 'comical', 'serious', 'heartbreaking', 'romantic', 'noticeable', 'grinding', 'tonal', 'gears', 'Ditto', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Pat', 'father', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'mom', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Tiffany', 'who', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'work.But', 'Cooper', 'who', 'movie', 'own', 'scarcely', 'moment', 'when', 'not', 'appear', 'screen', 'actor', 'spell', 'audience', 'first', 'frame', 'last', 'role-given', 'temptation', 'chew', 'scenery', 'opting', 'instead', 'understatement', 'portrayal', 'man', 'desire', 'fit', 'world', 'often', 'odds', 'ability', 'do', 'so', 'result', 'performance', 'laughter', 'tears', 'audience', 'never', 'contrived', 'manipulative', 'doing', 'so', 'so', 'deeply', 'core', 'character', 'even', 'accept', 'potentially', 'trite', 'belief', 'one', 'must', 'look', 'silver', 'lining', 'even', 'darkest', 'clouds', 'when', 'think', 'what', 'alternative', 'one', 'really', 'have', 'career-', 'defining', 'performance', 'actor', 'clearly', 'concerned', 'making', 'most', 'time', 'spotlight']",Silver Linings Playbook

I went in expecting a Serious Movie, but instead, this is a rom-com hiding behind the scrims of depression, OCD, and bipolar disorder.  I guess pulling off mild comedy behind those topics displays a certain deftness, but it doesn't make this movie historically great, either.  De Niro is clearly here to raise financing for the film, which means he can mail in a variant of his increasingly-standarized post-Meet-the-Fockers persona.  The whole pro-football-as-obsession side story is as pathetic here as it is in real life (and I say that as an NFL fan!).

The guy's family and friends try to prevent them from the meeting. But he loves his wife and wants to get her back. (His main problem is not his illness, but that he struggles to hold for his past love). Then he meets a girl who has mental problems too. For no reason she falls in love with him and tries to do everything to keep him. Looks like it's a great chance for the guy to get rid of his ""ghost"", start his life anew and have a new love, but he is still holding for his past love, his wife. He shows no interest in the ""crazy girl"". The crazy girl is trying to teach him dancing and reveal some the difference between them and normal people, so at the end when he meets his wife, he decides to let her go. He is not cured, but he accepts his new love and new life.The acting was good, not great, especially for DeNiro, but okay for a 3rd grade film. Story? I do not buy it. It looks like some ""sane"", smart people wrote a script about ""insane"" people to make big bucks on the topic and maybe get an Oscar. I do not mind main characters with mental problems, but why do the authors push forward the idea that mentally disable people are more frank, sincere, and ""real"" than normal? Isn't it a stereotype? They show his friends and even elder brother as jerks who did not care about him while he was in the hospital. But he has a big heart and loves everyone anyway. It's okay, but why such a bias? So that the audience to love the character and feel sorry for him and at the same time - feel guilty for their own inattentiveness? The trick it too cheap. Some details and dialogues sound fake too, it's a pure fantasy of the authors who tried to imagine how mentally disable people can speak and what they can discuss. He asks her if she slept with a woman, and voila, she did. And she even sat on the woman's laps. What a coincidence! And it's not the only one. The Philadelphia Eagles win every time when the characters are together... What a sign!At the end the authors tried to repeat the success of Little Miss Sunshine, including one of the messages: ""They lost, but they won."" Come on, be more original. I have seen it before. If you want to copy, make your copy better than original. Make catharsis more powerful, real, without fake tears of joy.Gimmicks, cheap tricks, and cheap laughs make the movie far fetched, unbelievable, and shallow.

1572853,A18F8WL8CASPVN,B008OGIPJA,"Ron4Sure ""Ron M.""","[0, 1]","The first hour of this film is relentlessly downbeat and depressing, seething with feel-bad hostility and recriminations, as Bradley Cooper is released from a Baltimore mental institution after eight months of rehab.  He comes home to mom and dad (Robert DeNiro), and finds that dad's livelihood is now entirely given over to sports gambling.  Both father and son are rabid Philadelphia Eagles fans.  Although the Bradley Cooper character has been diagnosed as bipolar, the violent rages he displays don't really fit the bipolar paradigm, and his general hostility seems to magically dissipate after he begins taking modern dance lessons with Jennifer Lawrence, whose husband has passed away. (Her husband has passed away and she's going through her own set of trauma, although it is hardly believable that such a beauty has been promiscuously sleeping around, as she asserts). The Cooper character was stashed in the nuthouse after he caught his wife in the shower having sex with a high school teacher colleague and apparently flipped out.  How this equates to bipolar disorder is never explained.  If you caught your wife in the shower that way, you'd probably flip too.  Naturally, from initial nastiness, abrasiveness and hostility (how anyone could be nasty to drop-dead gorgeous Jennifer Lawrence, she of the heavy eye shadow, albeit herself relentlessly hostile throughout the entire film, is tough to understand) emerges the sweet flower of love.  I'll say no more, as the movie wends its way to a phony happy ending.  The actors try their best, but there is not much they can do with a thin script.  Most of the scenes of bickering feel improvised rather than scripted.  There's no real sense of character arc here, and that the family fortunes suddenly hinge on a dance contest and a bet on a Philadelphia Eagles game seem quite a stretch.",3,"A depressing, confused, soap operatic mishmash of mental illness, family dysfunction, and Eagles football",1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,1850,"['first', 'hour', 'film', 'relentlessly', 'downbeat', 'depressing', 'seething', 'feel-bad', 'hostility', 'recriminations', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'released', 'Baltimore', 'mental', 'institution', 'eight', 'months', 'rehab', 'home', 'mom', 'dad', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'dad', 'livelihood', 'now', 'entirely', 'given', 'over', 'sports', 'gambling', 'father', 'son', 'are', 'rabid', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'fans', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'character', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'bipolar', 'violent', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'bipolar', 'paradigm', 'general', 'hostility', 'magically', 'dissipate', 'taking', 'modern', 'dance', 'lessons', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'husband', 'passed', 'away', 'husband', 'passed', 'away', 'going', 'own', 'set', 'trauma', 'hardly', 'believable', 'beauty', 'been', 'promiscuously', 'sleeping', 'around', 'Cooper', 'character', 'was', 'stashed', 'nuthouse', 'caught', 'wife', 'shower', 'having', 'sex', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'colleague', 'apparently', 'flipped', 'out', 'How', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'never', 'explained', 'caught', 'wife', 'shower', 'way', ""'d"", 'probably', 'flip', 'too', 'Naturally', 'initial', 'nastiness', 'abrasiveness', 'hostility', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'be', 'nasty', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'heavy', 'eye', 'shadow', 'relentlessly', 'hostile', 'entire', 'film', 'tough', 'understand', 'sweet', 'flower', 'love', ""'ll"", 'say', 'no', 'more', 'movie', 'way', 'phony', 'happy', 'ending', 'actors', 'try', 'best', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'thin', 'script', 'Most', 'scenes', 'bickering', 'feel', 'improvised', 'rather', 'scripted', 'real', 'sense', 'character', 'arc', 'here', 'family', 'suddenly', 'hinge', 'dance', 'contest', 'bet', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'game', 'seem', 'quite', 'stretch']",Silver Linings Playbook

Silver Linings Playbook is the worst sequence of formulaic movie tropes I've seen in a long, long while. Of all the movies released in 2012, I could pick one out of a hat and it would be better than Silver Linings Playbook.There is nothing original in this movie. It is flippant in places where it needs to be serious, it is trite in places where it needs to be original, and it is formulaic in places where it needs to be insightful. And the soundtrack is cloying.Take the following: ""Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow. Minus the whore thing, for the most part."" Here is a line, bereft of verisimilitude, that is so ingratiating as to be nauseating. Set aside the annoyance that a serious actor could ever deliver such a line with a straight face (and Jennifer Lawrence can't keep one, so conscious of her adoring audience is she--I implore you to go back and look), but, ask yourself what kind of writer could put such a line to paper. That is what people are celebrating here.I was able to leave without pausing when I needed to pee, having predicted the previous half dozen plot moves to my viewing partner--and come back to here her report that, ""It's exactly what you said would happen"". It was once written by someone--I cannot recall whom at the moment--that a good story will take you to an inevitable conclusion in a way that still surprises you. By logic, a bad story will take you to an inevitable conclusion in a way that is entirely predictable. Silve Linings Playbook is infuriating in its predictability.The problem is not the arc of romantic comedies. The problem is not Hollywood's over-use of The Magic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG's can be charming, done right). The problem is the way in which emotions play out in life. Emotions are sometimes predictable and sometimes not, but they matter to the person having them, and that is a matter worth taking seriously. This movie was not only predictable and dismissive, but it was consistently so all along the way to its inevitable and entirely prosaic denouement.This movie could have been saved (For contrast, Juno, just as nauseating, could never have been saved) with better writing, a cast that showed up to act and without the tortured football metaphor. But I'm the odd man out here. I see that the TomatoMeter has it at 92%. If this is how people see themselves and their romantic involvements, I pity them. And if this movie offers some emollient to those couples who need convincing that they are not in the wrong relationship... it still sucks.",1,Hackneyed and horrible,1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,2562,"['Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'worst', 'sequence', 'formulaic', 'movie', 'tropes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'movies', 'released', '2012', 'could', 'pick', 'one', 'out', 'hat', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook.There', 'nothing', 'original', 'movie', 'flippant', 'places', 'where', 'be', 'serious', 'trite', 'places', 'where', 'be', 'original', 'formulaic', 'places', 'where', 'be', 'insightful', 'soundtrack', 'cloying.Take', 'following', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'Tommy', 'crazy', 'whore', 'widow', 'whore', 'thing', 'most', 'part', 'Here', 'line', 'bereft', 'verisimilitude', 'so', 'ingratiating', 'be', 'nauseating', 'Set', 'annoyance', 'serious', 'actor', 'could', 'ever', 'deliver', 'such', 'line', 'straight', 'face', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'one', 'so', 'conscious', 'adoring', 'audience', 'implore', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'ask', 'kind', 'writer', 'could', 'put', 'line', 'paper', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'celebrating', 'here.I', 'was', 'able', 'leave', 'pausing', 'when', 'needed', 'pee', 'having', 'predicted', 'previous', 'half', 'dozen', 'plot', 'moves', 'viewing', 'partner', 'come', 'back', 'here', 'report', 'exactly', 'what', 'said', 'would', 'happen', 'was', 'once', 'written', 'someone', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'whom', 'moment', 'good', 'story', 'will', 'take', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'way', 'still', 'logic', 'bad', 'story', 'will', 'take', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'way', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'Silve', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'infuriating', 'predictability.The', 'problem', 'not', 'arc', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'problem', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'over-use', 'Magic', 'Pixie', 'Dream', 'Girl', 'MPDG', 'can', 'be', 'charming', 'done', 'right', 'problem', 'way', 'emotions', 'play', 'out', 'life', 'Emotions', 'are', 'sometimes', 'predictable', 'sometimes', 'not', 'matter', 'person', 'having', 'matter', 'worth', 'taking', 'seriously', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'predictable', 'dismissive', 'was', 'consistently', 'so', 'all', 'way', 'inevitable', 'entirely', 'prosaic', 'denouement.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'saved', 'contrast', 'Juno', 'just', 'nauseating', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'saved', 'better', 'writing', 'cast', 'showed', 'act', 'tortured', 'football', 'metaphor', ""'m"", 'odd', 'man', 'here', 'see', 'TomatoMeter', '92', '%', 'how', 'people', 'see', 'romantic', 'involvements', 'pity', 'movie', 'emollient', 'couples', 'who', 'need', 'convincing', 'are', 'not', 'wrong', 'relationship', 'still']",Silver Linings Playbook

Watching this movie made me realize I am turning into one of them, since the first thought that popped in my mind was &#34;Years ago there were more movies that were as good as this one and I had almost forgotten what this was like&#34;. So I guess the answer is yes, at least in what has to do with me and the movie industry.This film is one of the few in the last several years that have made me cherish sitting down to watch a movie. I have seen plenty of entertaining and thrilling films, but this one has no gimmicks to keep you enthralled. It is all about the story, the performances and the emotion. When the paths of two broken people collide, we get to see the best of human nature. Bradley Cooper is excellent in his portrayal of Pat, a bipolar that ended up in an institution as a result of an episode involving his wife and a lover. Now he is out and trying to get her back. But is Cooper's performance is excellent, there are few adjectives to describe the unbelievable performance of Jennifer Lawrence, who plays a woman whose life unraveled when her husband died. Both of them are trying to heal and finding each other may prove either helpful of devastating. There are many other characters that add color to this plot, such as the amazing Robert De Niro, who plays Pat's father and does so in his usual masterful way.This movie delivered pretty much everything you can expect to get when you sit down for the experience. There were laughs, touching moments, a story that kept us interested throughout, and actors that made us care about the characters.

The setting: A working class neighborhood in Philadelphia, peopled by obsessed Eagles fans and bettors. The story: Cooper's character, Pat, has spent the last several months in a mental institution, being treated for bi-polar disorder. His ex-wife has taken out a restraining order  on him. Without telling Dad (De Niro), Mom (Weaver) springs Pat and brings him home. Pat has a two-point plan: 1. go off his meds, 2. get his wife back. One day, while out for a run, he runs into a quirky and feisty young widow named Tiffany who's also clinging to sanity by a thread. A wary friendship ensues. Eventually they strike a deal: she'll help him get his wife back in exchange for him helping her win a dance contest. Family and friends get involved, bets are made, stakes are high, and in their own diverse ways, everyone's future is riding on the outcome.P.S.

This is presented in the very relatable story of an American family in Philadelphia.  Patrick (Bradley Cooper) is leaving the hospital, after 8 months as an inpatient, where he received his diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder and is going home to confront more than his fair share of life's major issues.  Ill-equipped emotionally, although now knowing the reason why his life has been in disarray, he takes the bull by the horns with a positive attitude and mines for a ""silver lining"".The interactions of friends and family, including his father (Robert De Niro, who is brilliant in this role) and mother (Jacki Weaver), shine brightly and display the boundaries crossed, inappropriate behavior, and controversial thinking present in BD.  Patrick becomes extremely frustrated with the ending of Ernest Hemingway's, ""A Farewell To Arms"", and in a hair-trigger response pitches the book through his bedroom window.  This scenario is very relative to the anger, which sometimes simmers right under the surface, and is very difficult to control.  His agitation (and/or bipolar anger) is quite understandable considering the state of his marriage and is as much present in the negative situations as in the positive; it walks hand-in-hand with the illness.Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence - 'Oscar' for this) is living with many intense issues of her own upon meeting Patrick.  Their introduction is splendid and humorously filled with the mix-ups that become unique to them.  Moving forward, they form a camaraderie through comparing medications, pointing out where the other is ""inappropriate"", jogging the same route, dancing lessons, and an airtight relationship that leads to love.  Their relationship is exceptionally acted and shows the somewhat 'normalcy' that the situation can and does become.The soundtrack (Danny Elfman) brings a standout masterpiece in itself to the characters.  A deft placement of purpose filled songs is overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time.  The vocals of Jack White (The White Stripes) are itchy and chaotic throughout. These are as ominous as the bombast of Led Zeppelin's fracturing song (""What Is and What Should Never Be"") featured during Patrick's bipolar episode at his parents home.  I found the music in this as important as another character to this movie's relevance.Director David O.

1572908,A1593I70EYRW8R,B008OGIPJA,SMULLET,"[4, 6]","I didn't care for the movie. I don't want to go into too much detail, since when I did (I had a long review written prior, which I've deleted to rewrite), all I accomplished was spoiling several of the plot points (as obvious as they are), and going off on how terrible it was. You don't need me to tell you what all is terrible, if you watch it you will see for yourself. My hope is that you don't waste time, and I'll try to give you the best reasons I can as succinctly as possible.The acting was good. Don't get me wrong. Jennifer Lawrence proved herself to be more than I ever expected she could be from her role in the Hunger Games. She still slumped into her monotone at some points, perhaps the worst points she could, but overall she did well. Good on her. The rest of the cast was good also.The real problem is the story. The story of this movie is quite simply absurd. You cannot relate to the characters because of how poorly they are written. There is no redemption, and for a movie about mental illness there's really no REAL emotional discomfort. The only discomfort generated was generated by having half of the dialogue yelled between angry people. That should not be your go-to tactic for creating conflict.Even more unfortunate is that there is really no conflict resolution. The character development is forced, and the way the characters act at certain points is completely opposite to how someone would act (by the way they feel). All of this misdirection is to force a twist at the end, a big ""surprise"", but it really ruined the little the story had going for it. It would have been much more effective to throw out the silly twist at the end, perhaps the book didn't have the ridiculous ending?The other beef I had was that the author, or at least the people who adapted the book for the movie, could not write men. Honestly. Men do not simply go crazy over an easy lay. I'm not saying men won't exploit women if they're easily available, but let's give ourselves an ounce of credit here. I saw that it was a husband-wife duo that worked on the book, perhaps the husband envisioned the female character and the wife envisioned the man? Either way, what they give us are two characters we can't relate to, who suffer mental illnesses that really don't seem to have much effect on them. I mean sure they're bizarre people, but if this is what we medicate over we have some serious issues as a society... I mean Bradley Cooper could just concentrate his problems away (apparently). If you can concentrate a problem away, it is not a mental illness that requires medication.Anyways, I see a lot of people like the movie, I can't really understand why. I simply didn't like it, no offense intended, I know a lot of people DO like it, so you can feel free to disagree.

The audience is treated to a roller coaster ride of emotional pitfalls and obstacles during Pat's recovery. Pat, determined to show his wife he is a changed man, tells his therapist he doesn't need medication and chooses instead to maintain a positive state of mind and look for the ""silver linings.""It isn't long before the viewer understands the scope of Pat's issues during his melt downs and violent reactions every time he hears his wedding song, (Stevie Wonder's ""My Cherie Amour,"") among other triggers. Tiffany Maxwell, a recent widow with issues of her own, meets Pat at his friend's house and sparks fly between them. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have real chemistry and the audience is immediately smitten with these two misfits. Aside from sharing the same kinds of medications, Pat and Tiffany seem to understand each other. Pat sees a means to communicate to Nikki through Tiffany and she promises to give Nikki (her sister's best friend) a letter from Pat, but in exchange he must be her dance partner in a competition.Complications arise with Pat's father bets on a Philadelphia Eagles game, money he's been saving to open a restaurant. His OCD and unusual superstitions lead to some very funny scenes. As a die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan he is convinced his son, who has been rehearsing with Tiffany instead of attending games is causing the Philadelphia Eagles to lose. This leads to one of the best scenes and major turning points in the film when Tiffany having been stood up, confronts Pat at his house. The outburst is hilarious and powerful to watch. The stakes go up when Pat's father raises the bet and uses his son's dance competition score as a parlay to win back his money. Now everything rides on the dance competition and Pat feeling the pressure, refuses to compete.This movie offers an unusual love story supported by a very strong cast. Bradley Cooper was the biggest surprise for me. Having seen him previously in comedies like ""Hangover,"" Cooper gives an outstanding performance and proves he has the acting range to tackle complex difficult roles. David O.Russell's adapted screenplay based on the novel by Matthew Quick also does a great job as director of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and garnered two Academy award nominations. Russell was originally attracted to the project because his own son suffers from a bipolar disorder and OCD,issues addressed in the movie. Russell brings sensitivity and strikes a balance with the characters and their neurosis in the film. All four lead actors including Robert Deniro, (as Pat's dad) earned Academy Award nominations. Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, gives a sassy multi-layer touchdown performance and won the Oscar for best actress.""Silver Linings Playbook"" is worth watching!

Big fan of Robert DeNiro and like his work in most of his films, like the actress who plays his wife, she was good.  Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are appealing actors and enjoy their work, thought most all the other actors were good. Regarding story, I understood why the Bradley character fell in love with Jennifer, she's young and beautiful and spent most of the film trying to engage and interact with him; wasn't clear in the story why she fell in love with him; he showed some kindness to her when he defended her honor, but thought story could have shown more the quality of his character when he was with her.  After Bradley's character begins taking his medication, he is kinder and better able to connect with his family, but Jennifer doesn't witness that.  He begins the story as a young man with mental problems, almost but not quite stable, initially refusing medication, jobless, living at home with his parents after leaving a mental institution; the story begins with him in the institution, and being sprung by his mother before he is really ready.  Story doesn't really explain why a gorgeous young woman would fall for him; he's handsome, he's somewhat kind to her, but the romance is not proved strongly enough in the story - she enters the story caring for him, and the story never explains why.  As I said, act 3 saves it, and the tender scenes between Robert DeNiro and Bradley's father and son help sell Bradley's character as a good guy, and other parts of the story help that portrayal as well (he finally begins taking meds after a wrestling match/fight with his parents), but I think it would have been better had she not entered the story already liking him; left the audience out of the loop on her character motivation.  3 and 3/4 stars, rounded up to 4.",4,Silver Linings Playbook...(SPOILERS),1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,1827,"['liked', 'third', 'act', 'saved', 'Big', 'fan', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'work', 'most', 'films', 'actress', 'who', 'wife', 'was', 'good', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'are', 'appealing', 'actors', 'enjoy', 'work', 'thought', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'Regarding', 'story', 'understood', 'why', 'Bradley', 'character', 'fell', 'love', 'Jennifer', 'young', 'beautiful', 'spent', 'most', 'film', 'trying', 'engage', 'interact', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'story', 'why', 'fell', 'love', 'showed', 'kindness', 'when', 'defended', 'honor', 'thought', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'more', 'quality', 'character', 'when', 'was', 'Bradley', 'character', 'taking', 'medication', 'kinder', 'better', 'able', 'connect', 'family', 'Jennifer', ""n't"", 'witness', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'mental', 'problems', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'stable', 'initially', 'refusing', 'medication', 'jobless', 'living', 'home', 'parents', 'leaving', 'mental', 'institution', 'story', 'institution', 'being', 'sprung', 'mother', 'really', 'ready', 'Story', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'why', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'woman', 'would', 'fall', 'handsome', 'somewhat', 'kind', 'romance', 'not', 'proved', 'strongly', 'enough', 'story', 'story', 'caring', 'story', 'never', 'why', 'said', 'act', '3', 'saves', 'tender', 'scenes', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Bradley', 'father', 'son', 'help', 'sell', 'Bradley', 'character', 'good', 'guy', 'other', 'parts', 'story', 'help', 'portrayal', 'as', 'well', 'finally', 'taking', 'meds', 'wrestling', 'match/fight', 'parents', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'not', 'entered', 'story', 'already', 'liking', 'left', 'audience', 'loop', 'character', 'motivation', '3', '3/4', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', '4']",Silver Linings Playbook

1572918,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B008OGIPJA,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[3, 6]","All the hype about Jennifer Lawrence makes me want to run screaming from her, but I have to admit she did okay in ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" a film about crazy people who fall in love in the way only Hollywood can imagine.  Her co-star, Bradley Cooper, is as good, despite being burdened with looking like what you'd get if Sean Penn and Woody Woodpecker had a baby.  I also kept thinking he was that guy from ""The Walking Dead.""  Or one of those two guys on that cable show about doctors who are brothers or whatever.  Lawrence and Cooper are both neurotically charming, more or less in the same way Jack Nicholson was neurotically charming in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" or ""As Good As It Gets."" Robert DeNiro turns in his best performance in a decade as Pat's OCD father, and though she doesn't have much to do except look pensive and make snacks, Jacki Weaver is fun as the befuddled mom, a post-modern version of all those doddering matriarchs that populated 1960s TV.  It's a compliment to her presence as an actress because her character gets almost no development.By now, many of us know that when it comes to the Oscar, actors who get to play mentally disturbed or challenged characters start salivating because they know the Academy is hot and heavy for it. I'm not sure they ever get the whole mental illness thing right -- I once dated a bi-polar woman who resembled and whose behavior was a lot like Lawrence's Tiffany, even though according to the film, it's Cooper's Pat that is the one who is bi-polar and not her. He seemed to suffer from delusions closer to schizophrenia and some amalgam of OCD and Tourette's, but what do I know?  The movie has an Indie feel to it, though not always consistently. While David O. Russell is no David Lean, his direction is by and large capable, and he gives working-class Philly the right blend of hominess and kitsch to be authentic.If there is a major weakness to ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" aside from its predictable but, of course, tiresome reliance on black and Asian stereotypes, it's a story that isn't quite sure what it wants to be.  The first half of the film functions reasonably well as a dark dramedy, but it turns rom-com soon after.  It works more or less because by then you'll like the characters, but the movie has the feel of having been forced to switch tracks to a standard Hollywood ending.  Not having read the book, I'm not sure if this is a flaw from the writer or from a film project that seems designed by committee, which usually results in the duck-billed playtpus version of art.The story at first wants to comment on the its-so-bad-you-just-gotta-laugh-at-it nature of dealing with mental illness, as Pat struggles after his release from a mental hospital to put his life back together, fixated most on winning back his wife.  There's genuine tension when he meets Tiffany, a nymphomaniac who you'd expect would be just as satisfied cutting herself as she is sleeping with everyone in the office.  You want the couple to fall in love because at heart they're good people, but at the same time, you understand that given the parameters of the story, that's unwise.  Of course, those parameters change, and when they do, the film loses its edge, culminating in an ending that rather than celebrates the fragile, hard-fought gains against mental illness so severe it must be medicated, embraces those illnesses instead.  By this time, you'll have forgotten that they have any real problems in this regard at all -- you'll get what I mean when you think about the resolution for the DeNiro character in particular.  While satisfying as a rom-com ending, it subverts what the other half of the movie seemed to be wanting to say.  People will tell me I'm over-analyzing what is supposed to be a feel-good movie, I'm sure, but shouldn't we expect more from an Oscar-nominated film?Back to Lawrence:  She has that odd combination of a lanky runner's body and a face still pudgy with baby fat, giving her a look that's not quite girl-next-door but not extraordinary either.  She is this era's Julia Roberts because of it, a woman who isn't so stunning that she alienates other women but at the same time is attractive enough that we're drawn to her.  Though the effort Hollywood is making to turn her into a star is nauseating, she does have potential, if mostly to maintain the status quo in an age where maybe the entertainment industry could be diversifying a little bit more.  If it feels like she's the flavor of the month, it's because she is, but she does not have to be.",4,An Uneven But Well-Acted Film,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,4559,"['hype', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'want', 'run', 'screaming', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'okay', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'film', 'crazy', 'people', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'way', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'imagine', 'co-star', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'as', 'good', 'being', 'burdened', 'looking', 'what', ""'d"", 'get', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Woody', 'Woodpecker', 'had', 'baby', 'also', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'guy', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'one', 'two', 'guys', 'cable', 'show', 'doctors', 'who', 'are', 'brothers', 'Lawrence', 'Cooper', 'are', 'neurotically', 'charming', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'way', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'neurotically', 'charming', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'As', 'Good', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'best', 'performance', 'decade', 'Pat', 'OCD', 'father', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'look', 'pensive', 'make', 'snacks', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'fun', 'befuddled', 'mom', 'post-modern', 'version', 'doddering', 'matriarchs', 'populated', '1960s', 'TV', 'compliment', 'presence', 'actress', 'character', 'almost', 'development.By', 'now', 'many', 'know', 'when', 'Oscar', 'actors', 'who', 'get', 'play', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'challenged', 'characters', 'start', 'salivating', 'know', 'Academy', 'hot', 'heavy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'get', 'whole', 'mental', 'illness', 'thing', 'right', 'once', 'dated', 'bi-polar', 'woman', 'who', 'resembled', 'behavior', 'was', 'lot', 'Lawrence', 'Tiffany', 'even', 'according', 'film', 'Cooper', 'Pat', 'one', 'who', 'bi-polar', 'not', 'seemed', 'suffer', 'delusions', 'closer', 'schizophrenia', 'amalgam', 'OCD', 'Tourette', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'movie', 'Indie', 'feel', 'not', 'always', 'consistently', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'David', 'Lean', 'direction', 'large', 'capable', 'working-class', 'Philly', 'right', 'blend', 'hominess', 'kitsch', 'be', 'authentic.If', 'major', 'weakness', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'aside', 'predictable', 'course', 'tiresome', 'reliance', 'black', 'Asian', 'stereotypes', 'story', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'be', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'functions', 'reasonably', 'well', 'dark', 'dramedy', 'rom-com', 'soon', 'more', 'less', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'characters', 'movie', 'feel', 'having', 'been', 'forced', 'switch', 'tracks', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'Not', 'having', 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'flaw', 'writer', 'film', 'project', 'designed', 'committee', 'usually', 'results', 'duck-billed', 'playtpus', 'version', 'art.The', 'story', 'first', 'comment', 'its-so-bad-you-just-', 'got', 'ta', '-laugh-at-it', 'nature', 'dealing', 'mental', 'illness', 'Pat', 'release', 'mental', 'hospital', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'fixated', 'most', 'winning', 'back', 'wife', 'genuine', 'tension', 'when', 'Tiffany', 'nymphomaniac', 'who', ""'d"", 'expect', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'satisfied', 'cutting', 'sleeping', 'everyone', 'office', 'want', 'couple', 'fall', 'love', 'heart', ""'re"", 'good', 'people', 'same', 'time', 'understand', 'given', 'parameters', 'story', 'unwise', 'course', 'parameters', 'change', 'when', 'do', 'film', 'edge', 'culminating', 'ending', 'rather', 'fragile', 'hard-fought', 'gains', 'mental', 'illness', 'so', 'severe', 'must', 'be', 'medicated', 'illnesses', 'instead', 'time', ""'ll"", 'have', 'forgotten', 'have', 'real', 'problems', 'regard', ""'ll"", 'get', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'think', 'resolution', 'DeNiro', 'character', 'particular', 'satisfying', 'rom-com', 'ending', 'what', 'other', 'half', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'wanting', 'say', 'People', 'will', 'tell', ""'m"", 'over-analyzing', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'feel-good', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'more', 'Oscar-nominated', 'film', 'Back', 'Lawrence', 'odd', 'combination', 'lanky', 'runner', 'body', 'face', 'still', 'baby', 'fat', 'giving', 'look', 'not', 'quite', 'girl-next-door', 'not', 'extraordinary', 'either', 'era', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'so', 'stunning', 'other', 'women', 'same', 'time', 'attractive', 'enough', ""'re"", 'drawn', 'effort', 'Hollywood', 'making', 'turn', 'star', 'nauseating', 'have', 'potential', 'mostly', 'maintain', 'status', 'quo', 'age', 'where', 'maybe', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'could', 'be', 'diversifying', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'flavor', 'month', 'not', 'have', 'be']",Silver Linings Playbook

1572922,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B008OGIPJA,Steven Aldersley,"[4, 6]","What kind of romantic comedy do you prefer? Classics, such as It Happened One Night, Pretty Woman and Roman Holiday, or something quirky, like Annie Hall or Harold and Maude? Silver Linings Playbook has more drama present than most romantic comedies, but it still belongs in that category. It would also be classified as somewhat quirky.Mental illness isn't funny, but I don't think that any subject should be off limits when it comes to comedy. The key is doing it with respect and a degree of realism. For example, cancer is one of the most unpleasant things in existence, but 50/50 was a comedy that worked, because the screenplay allowed us to see some of the seriousness of the situation. Silver Linings Playbook follows the same path.If you have ever seen As Good as It Gets, you might have some idea what to expect from Silver Linings Playbook. Both films feature incredibly good actors, who are capable of mixing drama with comedy. Both include serious scenes that an average actor might struggle with. The two stories revolve around unlikely romances, that shouldn't work, but it feels right when they do.Jennifer Lawrence has to be one of Hollywood's hottest properties. She received an Oscar nomination for Winter's Bone, and has reached huge audiences by appearing in X-Men: First Class, and The Hunger Games. I'm sure a lot of people saw Silver Linings Playbook just because Lawrence was involved. She's certainly attractive, but she can really act too. This role requires more than just a pretty face, and she pulls it off with apparent ease.The setting reminds me of Russell's last film, The Fighter; it's gritty and realistic, and full of dramatic scenes. Families often become involved in shouting matches rather than sitting down to have rational conversations. Two actors won Oscars in that film, and I wouldn't be surprised to see another nomination go to Lawrence for her work here.The story focuses on Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper), who we see being released from a mental institution. He is married, and has plans to reconnect with his wife. He is friendly and calm most of the time, but can sometimes snap. One trigger is a song, and sometimes he hears it in his head when it's not even playing. Pat moves in with his mother (Jacki Weaver) and father (Robert De Niro), and walks into their bedroom at 3am for insignificant reasons. His judgment is not exactly reliable.Pat's life begins to change when he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who is the sister-in-law of one of his friends. She's direct and irrational at times, and it soon becomes clear that she has problems of her own. The two enter into a sort of alliance and become friends. Tiffany agrees to give a letter to Pat's wife if he'll train with her and enter a dance contest that she wants to be a part of.De Niro is funny in almost every scene in which he appears. He plays a Philadelphia Eagles fan, and he's convinced that his actions, and the actions of those around him, have an effect on the team's results. One of the best scenes in the film occurs when Tiffany confronts him about his superstitions.Chris Tucker is also funny in all of his scenes. He was a fellow patient at the mental institution and seems to care about what happens to Pat.Another huge plus is the soundtrack. Led Zeppelin finally allowed songs to be used in movies and ads, and the placing of What is and what should never be is particularly effective. You'll also hear The White Stripes, Alabama Shakes, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, Stevie Wonder, and the Eagles of Death Metal. It's one of the best soundtracks of 2012.I won't ruin the outcome, but it's fun to see Pat and Tiffany work through their problems. It's good to see a film avoid the usual romantic comedy formula and come up with some original ideas. Comedy works best when it surprises you, rather than something which tries to make you laugh with every action or line of dialogue. It's well-written and well-acted, with a number of memorable scenes. Catch it while it's still in theaters if you can.Overall score 4.5/5",5,Elite romantic comedy in the same vein as As Good as It Gets,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,4048,"['What', 'kind', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'do', 'prefer', 'Classics', 'such', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'something', 'quirky', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'more', 'drama', 'present', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'still', 'category', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'classified', 'somewhat', 'quirky.Mental', 'illness', ""n't"", 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'subject', 'should', 'be', 'off', 'limits', 'when', 'comedy', 'key', 'doing', 'respect', 'degree', 'realism', 'example', 'cancer', 'one', 'most', 'unpleasant', 'things', 'existence', '50/50', 'was', 'comedy', 'worked', 'screenplay', 'allowed', 'see', 'seriousness', 'situation', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'same', 'path.If', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'As', 'Good', 'might', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'films', 'feature', 'incredibly', 'good', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'capable', 'mixing', 'drama', 'comedy', 'include', 'serious', 'scenes', 'average', 'actor', 'might', 'struggle', 'two', 'stories', 'revolve', 'unlikely', 'romances', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'right', 'when', 'do.Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'be', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'hottest', 'properties', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'reached', 'huge', 'audiences', 'appearing', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'Hunger', 'Games', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'people', 'saw', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'just', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'involved', 'certainly', 'attractive', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'too', 'role', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'off', 'apparent', 'ease.The', 'setting', 'reminds', 'Russell', 'last', 'film', 'Fighter', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'full', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'Families', 'often', 'become', 'involved', 'shouting', 'matches', 'rather', 'sitting', 'down', 'have', 'rational', 'conversations', 'Two', 'actors', 'won', 'Oscars', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'nomination', 'go', 'Lawrence', 'work', 'here.The', 'story', 'Pat', 'Solitano', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'who', 'see', 'being', 'released', 'mental', 'institution', 'married', 'plans', 'reconnect', 'wife', 'friendly', 'calm', 'most', 'time', 'can', 'sometimes', 'snap', 'One', 'trigger', 'song', 'sometimes', 'head', 'when', 'not', 'even', 'playing', 'Pat', 'mother', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'walks', 'bedroom', '3am', 'insignificant', 'reasons', 'judgment', 'not', 'exactly', 'reliable.Pat', 'life', 'change', 'when', 'Tiffany', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'sister-in-law', 'one', 'friends', 'direct', 'irrational', 'times', 'soon', 'clear', 'problems', 'own', 'two', 'enter', 'sort', 'alliance', 'become', 'friends', 'Tiffany', 'give', 'letter', 'Pat', 'wife', ""'ll"", 'train', 'enter', 'dance', 'contest', 'be', 'part', 'of.De', 'Niro', 'funny', 'almost', 'scene', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'fan', 'convinced', 'actions', 'actions', 'have', 'effect', 'team', 'results', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'when', 'Tiffany', 'superstitions.Chris', 'Tucker', 'also', 'funny', 'scenes', 'was', 'fellow', 'patient', 'mental', 'institution', 'care', 'what', 'Pat.Another', 'huge', 'soundtrack', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'finally', 'allowed', 'songs', 'be', 'used', 'movies', 'ads', 'placing', 'What', 'what', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'particularly', 'effective', ""'ll"", 'also', 'hear', 'White', 'Stripes', 'Alabama', 'Shakes', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Eagles', 'Death', 'Metal', 'one', 'best', 'soundtracks', '2012.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'outcome', 'fun', 'see', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'work', 'problems', 'good', 'see', 'film', 'usual', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'formula', 'come', 'up', 'original', 'ideas', 'Comedy', 'best', 'when', 'rather', 'something', 'make', 'action', 'line', 'dialogue', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'number', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Catch', 'still', 'theaters', 'can.Overall', 'score', '4.5/5']",Silver Linings Playbook

Reviews of both theatrical versions and home video are grouped under all formats. Hence, the majority of the reviews posted before this one are of the film. I always suggest that readers sort by most recent when reading reviews. Also, all formats of home video (both DVD and BD) are grouped too.  This review is of the BD+DVD+Digital version.Obviously, with this many reviews already up about the film itself I don't need to repeat much of the info, except to say that it took me a while to get into the story since I knew nothing about the plot, just that it takes place just outside Philly - my city-, where it was filmed. There's music but it's not a musical. There are some funny moments (the diner scene is ALMOST as good as the one in ""Five Easy Pieces"") but it's not a comedy. And it takes a while to realize that it's about depression and bi-polar disorders. But once it starts the acting (especially Jennifer Lawrence - Academy Award winner!).The BD has a slew of bonus features - some excellent; a few are throwaways. First is a group of 18 ""Deleted Scenes"" (without commentary) which totals 26 minutes. Next comes the 28-minute featurette ""The Movie That Became a Movement"" - which starts out discussing  the mental health issues with the President of the American Psychiatric Assn and TV's Dr. Oz ( oddly, in his ""hospital blues"" like he just came from the operating room!), and then moves into discussion of the music, scripts and dance choreography.

The other three ""bonuses are just ""fluff"": 1  minutes of ""dance rehearsal"" footage, 56 seconds of actor Bradley Cooper trying to use a steadicam and - if you want to learned the dance that Cooper and Lawrence do at film's conclusion - there is a ""learn to dance"" lesson by the film's choreographer that runs 11 minutes.Overall I enjoyed the film.

1572924,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B008OGIPJA,Steven Johnson,"[1, 1]","In a ho-hum year for American cinema, Silver Linings Playbook gleams out of the dull woodwork as a modest film about people with modest ambitions, told at such a painfully honest level that it rises above as the best film of 2012.The straightforward narrative, of a middle-aged man living with his parents and dealing with bipolar disorder, is enhanced through superb performances and powerful imagery. Bradley Cooper (who I'm usually not a fan of) giving a daring and moving performance as the protagonist, Jennifer Lawrence as the heartbreaking but electrifying heroine, and Robert De Niro as the well-intentioned but pathetic father lead the extraordinary cast in this tragicomedy. All three start off the film recovering from bad places in their lives, and try to build them back up.Reconstruction proves difficult, emphasized in moments like Cooper's character moving home, seeing his brother's picture hanging on the wall while his own has been taken down and is leaning on a table. Lawrence's character (in one of several memorable monologues) tells of having to constantly give all of herself, only to receive nothing back. While the circumstances the characters face are more extreme than most of us will face in our lifetimes, they hint at positions we have all had to grapple with, in varying degrees of questioning one's own self-worth.This film all seems to take place within several square miles. The characters' dreams are not impossible ones. The biggest ambition seems to be getting a 5 out of 10 at a dance competition, an underwhelming feat that provides one of the film's biggest laughs. Yet despite the understated attributes in the content of the film, the final product and emotional impact are profound and powerful, giving audiences one of the most rewarding and moving comedies in recent years.",5,"Fantastic, one of the best movies I've ever seen!",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,1820,"['ho-hum', 'year', 'American', 'cinema', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'dull', 'woodwork', 'modest', 'film', 'people', 'modest', 'ambitions', 'told', 'painfully', 'honest', 'level', 'best', 'film', '2012.The', 'straightforward', 'narrative', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'living', 'parents', 'dealing', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'enhanced', 'superb', 'performances', 'powerful', 'imagery', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'who', ""'m"", 'usually', 'not', 'fan', 'giving', 'daring', 'moving', 'performance', 'protagonist', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'heartbreaking', 'electrifying', 'heroine', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'well-intentioned', 'pathetic', 'father', 'lead', 'extraordinary', 'cast', 'tragicomedy', 'three', 'start', 'film', 'recovering', 'bad', 'places', 'lives', 'try', 'build', 'back', 'up.Reconstruction', 'difficult', 'emphasized', 'moments', 'Cooper', 'character', 'moving', 'home', 'seeing', 'brother', 'picture', 'hanging', 'wall', 'own', 'been', 'taken', 'down', 'leaning', 'table', 'Lawrence', 'character', 'one', 'several', 'memorable', 'monologues', 'tells', 'having', 'constantly', 'give', 'only', 'receive', 'nothing', 'back', 'circumstances', 'characters', 'face', 'are', 'more', 'extreme', 'most', 'will', 'face', 'lifetimes', 'hint', 'positions', 'have', 'had', 'grapple', 'varying', 'degrees', 'questioning', 'one', 'own', 'self-worth.This', 'film', 'take', 'place', 'several', 'square', 'miles', 'characters', 'dreams', 'are', 'not', 'impossible', 'ones', 'biggest', 'ambition', 'be', 'getting', '5', '10', 'dance', 'competition', 'underwhelming', 'feat', 'one', 'film', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'understated', 'attributes', 'content', 'film', 'final', 'product', 'emotional', 'impact', 'are', 'profound', 'powerful', 'giving', 'audiences', 'one', 'most', 'rewarding', 'moving', 'comedies', 'recent', 'years']",Silver Linings Playbook

But I will say that the acting is simply superb -- particularly Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, as the coming-together thirty-somethings with a shared disheveled past and an emotional steamer trunk full of similar disconnects.  (DeNiro goes without saying.)  The way in which these real people connect their loose wires is a testament both to the author and to the director (David Russell) of this comic tale of human interaction.  You will long remember the characters and you will never forget the story.  This film is an example of what Hollywood can do well but unfortunately does far less frequently now by sacrificing the stories of real people on the altar of special effects, morphing and extended adolescent superhero nonsense.

1572928,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,B008OGIPJA,S. T. Peterson,"[4, 15]","Premise: married male teacher comes home to find his wife in teh shower having sex with another teacher. (They are all teachers by the way.) Married guy ""Snaps"" and beats the adulterer so badly he almost dies and has to be hopsitalized. Married guy cops a plea withe courts, not for anger management therapy, but to be put in a mental hospital. Married guy gets out after 8 months and wants to get his wife back. Instead he meets a widow whose husband dies in a car accident on the way back to her with some lingerie to get her to have sex with him as she has been ""depressed"" and ""distant"". She therefore ""snaps"" at his beloved husband's death and her guilt over being sex and not giving him sex and goes and has sex with everyone and anyone. She lives close to the ex mental patient married guy. They meet and fall in love.Message: Crazy is normal is what this movie was trying sell. The characters even say so. They tell their families as the families didn't ""snap"" and do crazy stuff and get locked up for it or get fired for it or lose everything they have because of it that they are the real psychotic one and psychotic characters are really the sane, normal ones who are ""living"". For example, the married guy's dad we learn beat up people at a football game and therefore is barred from the stadium for life. So naturally because he now lives with his wife in their house and comfortably and likes family an d football he is not being ""real"" as he has not been discovered as psychotic like his son was. The sexaholic's brother-in-law lives in misery as he is henpecked by the sexaholic's sister. So of course since they don't talk and just grumble behind each other's backs they are the real psychotic ones, not the sexaholic or the angry out of control guy. They even take this theme one step further. The angry crazy guy really isn't crazy. It is just learned behavior from the father and because the older brother is favored and because the crazy guy has low self-esteem. Movie moral: if you have a feeling run with it to the extreme otherwise you are repressing yourself and cause yourself harm. Don't bother with maturity and learning to deal with your emotions. Just let'er fly.Also as with all Bradley Cooper movies I have seen you have the liberal moralizing. You have Asian Indians being made fun of be those ""evil white people"" (those ""other"" white people) at the ball game. Some Philadelphia rednecks sees the bus of Asian Indians tailgating and cooking curry and says somethingn about how stinky it is. So naturally it is OK to go into a rage and beat up the guy because ""we all know all non-white Americans are just victims waiting to happen and by the victimizer evil white man"".The two characters are just self-centered and foul mouthed. I wouldn't even want to know them let alone cheer for them to get together in the end . . . but we are supposed to. We are supposed to be their advocates much in the same way we were told to support the weird ""Little Miss Sunshine"" family. Because again ""normal is crazy. Crazy is normal."" ""We are never to blame for our behavior . . . it is always someone else's or something's fault . . . infidelity. . . a death . . . etc.""The movie was very sloppy even in delivering its message. Which is it? The guy is not crazy and the pills make him numb. Or in reality he is really crazy after beating up his mother and get somewhat normal after being forced to take the pills? We get it both ways . . . kinda just thrown at us.  The dance . . . . Uh . . . nothing really to say there but we are supposed to be impressed by their ""hard work"" preparing for a dance competition. But in reality it looks sloppy and stupid, even for the role it plays in the movie. He isn't going to keep his promise to go rehearse but instead go to the game. No wait he is. No wait he didn't. But she is OK with it. What??? Again just sloppy delivery.But outside of liberal hotbeds most of us know that these characters are just losers. No tears are shed except for the $14.99 you have to pay to see this now before the paying the newly increased price of a VOD rental on Amazon of $3.99/4.99.

It starts off funny and ends with an explosion of smaltz.Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper)is released after 8 months from a state psychiatric institution after having nearly beaten a man to death,into the care of his mother(Jacki Weaver) and father(Robert De Niro).He is a handful and very explosive,waking up in the middle of the night,telling his parents he doesn't accept a Hemingway book he's reading,then proceeding to turn over the house to look for his wedding video.His wife Nicki has taken out a restraining order against him.He wants to slim and read through all her high school English books, improving himself to get back to her.Then he meets the mysterious Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence),a young widow who's just as volatile and medicated as himself.She agrees to help blunt and tactless Pat rebuild his marriage but has an odd favour to ask in return,to join her in a dance competition and train with her for it.David  O'Russell is good on indie-type films like Three Kings,Spanking the Monkey.This has an indie sensibility.This film has some outstanding performances especially the central one of Jennifer Lawrence,without whom the film would have dropped off the radar.De Niro too is superb as the father who wants to bond with his son and opens himself up,yet also seeks to integrate him into his life,yet is at the receiving end of the potential violence Pat is able to unleash.Jacki Weaver is good as the mother who thinks everything can be made right with crab-cakes.Chris Tucker is good also as a fellow sufferer he met in the institution.There are some well-rounded cameos of minor characters and scenes,e.g. when Tiffany and Pat go to have a meal at Tiffany's friend Veronica's and Tiffany and Pat are just too honest,saying they want to leave half way through,not interested in the lies and half-truths of suburban life.Pat has a tendency to get into fights,a characteristic he shares with his dad.I thought Cooper had a tendency to mistake quirkiness for bipolarity and mixed the two up.I also think the dance competition/rom.com dissipates the real urgency of the mental illness as a subject.

1572950,A31K0IGAB25GQM,B008OGIPJA,the_baseball_man2003,"[4, 10]","From the moment I saw the first trailer, I wanted to see this movie.  I finally got a chance to see it last month and I was not disappointed.  This is easily of of the best films of the year with probably the best cast of the year.  This film is based of the best selling book of the same name and David O' Russell captured it perfectly.  The film stars Bradley Cooper as Pat Solitano.  His mom has just picked him up from a mental institution in which he has spent the last eight months for assaulting his wife's lover.  Even though the doctors feel as though he needs more time there, Pat leaves and head home...well at least his parent's home.  Pat wants to get his life back on track and his wife back by working out, reading his wife's summer reading list for her class and work on his ""issues"" even though he believes he does not need his medication in order to do it.  This is going to be easier said then done because right after his fight with his wife's lover, she put a restraining order on him, she moved away and he lost his teaching job.  After being invited to dinner by his friend, Ronnie, he meets Tiffany.  A woman who has just lost her policeman husband and has issues of their own.  Even though things are rocky between to two of them at first, they eventually form an odd friendship.  When Pat learns that Tiffany has a personal connection to his wife, Nikki, the two of them strike up a deal.  If he agrees to be her partner at an upcoming dance competition, she'll agree to supply his wife a letter from him.  At first glance, this might seem like a crazy idea for a romantic comedy drama and that there is no way in hell that this could work.  Having said that, this film amazingly works.  Its funny, heartfelt, insightful and inspiring.  What makes it so good is that all of these people are not caricatures of people.  They are real people with real hopes, dreams and issues.  To me, the best characters are the ones we can identify with and you can do that to a certain extent with each of these characters.  David O' Russell directed and wrote this film.  I give him credit for being able to make a great film that included mental illness, the Philadelphia Eagles, comedy and drama all in the same film.  He got nominated for a Best Director Oscar for The Fighter (another amazing film) and should receive writing and directing nominations at the next Oscars.  Jennifer Lawrence is truly one of the best and brightest stars today.  Even though her character is suppose to be older and she was only 21 at the time of filming, she is completely believable as a damage woman looking for a silver lining in her life.  She was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for Winter's Bone, gave another acclaimed performance in the huge blockbuster The Hunger Games and I see another Oscar nomination for this film.  She deserved the first one and she really deserves another one.  Robert De Niro is back ladies and gentleman.  After a few years of films and performances that were not that well received, he comes back with a vengeance in this film as Pat's OCD father.  Add to his list another Oscar nomination for this performance.  He walks the line of concerned father and superstitious Eagles fan beautifully.  Jacki Weaver was great as his concerned mom.  She earned a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for Animal Kingdom as the mom from hell and she does a complete 180 as as woman that wants to see her son get back on her feet.  I think she should get another one for this film.  Chris Tucker was in the film as Pat's friend from the mental institution and all I have to say is welcome back Chris.  We know him mostly as loud mouth characters from Money Talks, Friday and the hugely successful Rush Hour franchise.  He really tones it down to be a more realistic character and he is still funny as hell.  I don't know it it will happen but he should get a Best Supporting Actor nomination because he was truly memorable in this film.  The rest of the supporting cast is great as well in their roles.  I reserve the highest acclaim for Bradley Cooper.  We mostly know him from comedies like Wedding Crashers, Hit and Run, and the highly acclaimed (and funny as hell) The Hangover.  Last year, he made a film called Limitless that showed that he does have some range.  His performance from Silver Linings Playbook takes that to another level.  This is not only his best performance to date but this is also one of the best performances of the year.  He was extremely believable as Pat.  Even though his character was highly troubled, we saw a guy that was really trying to get his act together.  You see Pat at his best and you see him at his worst.  You feel for him from the moment he leaves the mental hospital to the moment the film ends.  You really want him to get his silver lining.  If he is not nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, it will be a travesty.  This is easily one of the best films of the year and one of the best films ever made.",5,Silver Linings Playbook:  An Instant Classic and An Instant Oscar Contender,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,4968,"['moment', 'saw', 'first', 'trailer', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'last', 'month', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'easily', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'probably', 'best', 'cast', 'year', 'film', 'based', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'David', 'O', 'Russell', 'captured', 'perfectly', 'film', 'stars', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Pat', 'Solitano', 'mom', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'mental', 'institution', 'spent', 'last', 'eight', 'months', 'assaulting', 'wife', 'lover', 'Even', 'doctors', 'feel', 'more', 'time', 'there', 'Pat', 'head', 'home', 'well', 'least', 'parent', 'home', 'Pat', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'track', 'wife', 'back', 'working', 'out', 'reading', 'wife', 'summer', 'reading', 'list', 'class', 'work', 'issues', 'even', 'not', 'need', 'medication', 'order', 'do', 'going', 'be', 'easier', 'said', 'then', 'done', 'because', 'right', 'fight', 'wife', 'lover', 'put', 'restraining', 'order', 'moved', 'away', 'lost', 'teaching', 'job', 'being', 'invited', 'dinner', 'friend', 'Ronnie', 'Tiffany', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'policeman', 'husband', 'issues', 'own', 'Even', 'things', 'are', 'rocky', 'two', 'first', 'eventually', 'form', 'odd', 'friendship', 'When', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'personal', 'connection', 'wife', 'Nikki', 'two', 'strike', 'up', 'deal', 'be', 'partner', 'upcoming', 'dance', 'competition', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'supply', 'wife', 'letter', 'first', 'glance', 'might', 'seem', 'crazy', 'idea', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'drama', 'way', 'hell', 'could', 'work', 'Having', 'said', 'film', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'heartfelt', 'insightful', 'inspiring', 'What', 'so', 'good', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'caricatures', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'issues', 'best', 'characters', 'are', 'ones', 'can', 'identify', 'can', 'do', 'certain', 'extent', 'characters', 'David', 'O', 'Russell', 'directed', 'wrote', 'film', 'give', 'credit', 'being', 'able', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'included', 'mental', 'illness', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'comedy', 'drama', 'same', 'film', 'got', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'Fighter', 'amazing', 'film', 'should', 'receive', 'writing', 'directing', 'nominations', 'next', 'Oscars', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'brightest', 'stars', 'today', 'Even', 'character', 'suppose', 'be', 'older', 'was', 'only', '21', 'time', 'filming', 'completely', 'believable', 'damage', 'woman', 'looking', 'silver', 'lining', 'life', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'gave', 'acclaimed', 'performance', 'huge', 'blockbuster', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'see', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'deserved', 'first', 'one', 'really', 'one', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'back', 'ladies', 'gentleman', 'few', 'years', 'films', 'performances', 'were', 'not', 'that', 'well', 'received', 'back', 'vengeance', 'film', 'Pat', 'OCD', 'father', 'Add', 'list', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'walks', 'line', 'concerned', 'father', 'superstitious', 'Eagles', 'fan', 'beautifully', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'was', 'great', 'concerned', 'mom', 'earned', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'mom', 'hell', 'complete', '180', 'woman', 'see', 'son', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'think', 'should', 'get', 'one', 'film', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'was', 'film', 'Pat', 'friend', 'mental', 'institution', 'have', 'say', 'welcome', 'back', 'Chris', 'know', 'mostly', 'loud', 'mouth', 'characters', 'Money', 'Talks', 'Friday', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'franchise', 'really', 'down', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'character', 'still', 'funny', 'hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'happen', 'should', 'get', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'was', 'truly', 'memorable', 'film', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'roles', 'reserve', 'highest', 'acclaim', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'mostly', 'know', 'comedies', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Hit', 'Run', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'funny', 'hell', 'Hangover', 'Last', 'year', 'made', 'film', 'called', 'Limitless', 'showed', 'have', 'range', 'performance', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'level', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'year', 'was', 'extremely', 'believable', 'Pat', 'Even', 'character', 'was', 'highly', 'troubled', 'saw', 'guy', 'was', 'really', 'trying', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'see', 'best', 'see', 'worst', 'feel', 'moment', 'mental', 'hospital', 'moment', 'film', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'silver', 'lining', 'not', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'will', 'be', 'travesty', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made']",Silver Linings Playbook

Starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, (along with a sensational supporting cast), it's a story of mental illnesses and improbable love.  I thought it was beautiful.This was my first experience with Jennifer Lawrence and I her performance here was incredible.  Brooding and explosive, she was an ambient, unmitigated element who somehow also brought real humor to the film - I was blown away by that.  And Bradley Cooper was similarly effective.  Stack on Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker, (Tucker nailed it), and it's a win across the board.  I'm so pleased I opted to sit this through.Silver Linings is quirky and it's moving.  I laughed often.  I think there's also some tragedy in what's offered here and that's valuable.  I've suffered through too many relationship comedies and it's about time someone broke the mold and started taking the genre seriously.  It's not that I've ever been opposed to them, it's just been so rare to land on any with real substance.  But there is most certainly substance here and it's instilled some faith in me.  The next time I'm walking the rental wall at my local movie store, you can bet I'll slow down for the films I used to run past.  I've been reborn and my wife will likely be very happy about that...If I had one complaint, however, it would be the blatant adverts purchased by Apple.  The ipod situations, (and there were a few), were distractingly tacky and did some damage.  At least in my opinion they did.  A woman mocking people for not owning the product, plugging the product into a futuristic wall dock, the product being gifted, the giftee gushing over THAT, videos watched on the product, the product being danced too, etc..  No thank you.But I do recommend the film and do so highly.  ipods aside, it's pretty great and absolutely worth what they're asking.Thank you for your time.- t",4,"Taking the sting out of, ""romantic comedy"".",1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,1947,"['Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', '2012', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'directed', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'Starring', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'sensational', 'supporting', 'cast', 'story', 'mental', 'illnesses', 'improbable', 'love', 'thought', 'was', 'beautiful.This', 'was', 'first', 'experience', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'performance', 'here', 'was', 'incredible', 'Brooding', 'explosive', 'was', 'ambient', 'unmitigated', 'element', 'who', 'somehow', 'also', 'brought', 'real', 'humor', 'film', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'was', 'similarly', 'effective', 'Stack', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'Tucker', 'nailed', 'win', 'board', ""'m"", 'so', 'pleased', 'opted', 'sit', 'through.Silver', 'Linings', 'quirky', 'moving', 'laughed', 'often', 'think', 'also', 'tragedy', 'what', 'offered', 'here', 'valuable', ""'ve"", 'suffered', 'too', 'many', 'relationship', 'comedies', 'time', 'someone', 'broke', 'mold', 'started', 'taking', 'genre', 'seriously', 'not', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'opposed', 'just', 'been', 'so', 'rare', 'land', 'real', 'substance', 'most', 'certainly', 'substance', 'here', 'instilled', 'faith', 'next', 'time', ""'m"", 'walking', 'rental', 'wall', 'local', 'movie', 'store', 'can', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'slow', 'down', 'films', 'used', 'run', 'past', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reborn', 'wife', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'had', 'one', 'complaint', 'however', 'would', 'be', 'blatant', 'adverts', 'purchased', 'Apple', 'ipod', 'situations', 'were', 'few', 'were', 'distractingly', 'tacky', 'did', 'damage', 'least', 'opinion', 'did', 'A', 'woman', 'mocking', 'people', 'not', 'owning', 'product', 'plugging', 'product', 'futuristic', 'wall', 'dock', 'product', 'being', 'gifted', 'giftee', 'gushing', 'videos', 'watched', 'product', 'product', 'being', 'danced', 'too', 'No', 'thank', 'you.But', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'highly', 'ipods', 'aside', 'pretty', 'great', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'what', ""'re"", 'time.-', 't']",Silver Linings Playbook

Russell's comedy drama ""Silver Linings Playbook"" starts with a Philadelphia mental health facility, from which a thirty-something former teacher Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) is now released. Determined to win back his wife Nikki who has run away, Pat agrees to be a dance partner of recently widowed Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), who promises him to deliver his message to Nikki. By the way, Tiffany has lost her job for having sex with everyone in the office.Not many people would think of making a romantic comedy involving two troubled souls, pro football betting and dancing competition. Based on a book by Matthew Quick, David O. Russell (director of ""Three Kings"" and a philosophical comedy ""I Heart Huckabees"") tactfully handles the subject matter that could be easily coarse and offensive.The greatest credit for making this tricky premise work goes to the actors. Bradley Cooper (Oscar nominated) and Jennifer Lawrence (who won Oscar) both deserve every accolade heaped on them, and so do the supporting actors, especially Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver (both nominated for Oscar) as Pat's concerned parents.

1572979,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008OGIPJA,Turfseer,"[17, 32]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0I had some trepidations about 'Silver Linings Playbook' because I heard it was another one of those quirky indies, which I usually don't care for. Usually in films that have quirky characters like 'Little Miss Sunshine' or 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", there's a quirky group of misfits who end triumphing over a bunch of straw men reactionaries (school bullies often end up in these straw men roles, for example). Fortunately, director David O. Russell's quirky misfits in 'Silver Linings Playbook', Pat Solitano, a bi-polar former substitute teacher and Tiffany Maxwell, an emotionally disturbed widow, are only pitted against one another; thus this particular quirky indie, isn't burdened with an us vs. them subtext.'Silver Linings', however, is not without its problems. It's a film about a burgeoning romance between two emotionally disturbed people. Russell tries to find humor in people who are emotionally unstable. Anyone who's known people who have been diagnosed as 'bipolar', will tell you it's no laughing matter. But Russell wants us to laugh at Pat during the first act of 'Silver Linings. After he's released from a mental health facility in Baltimore as a result of an eight month court ordered commitment, Pat still remains obsessed with his ex-wife, Nikki, and throws tantrums in front of his parents because he doesn't like the 'unhappy ending' to a Hemingway novel and on another occasion, is unable to find an old wedding video.In addition to the unpleasant tantrums, a flashback reveals why Pat was sent to a mental health facility in the first place--he caught a teacher from their mutual school, in the shower with his wife, and then proceeded to pummel him senseless. His court-ordered therapist, Dr. Patel (wonderfully played by a prominent Indian actor, Anupam Kher), manages to be a settling influence on Pat, who recognizes that he needs to look at the positive aspects in life (hence the title, 'silver linings playbook').'Silver Linings' invariably picks up in the second act, when Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence, with her manic energy, proves she has comic chops--a nice contrast to her more serious role in 'Winter Bones' (let's forget about her throw away part in 'Hunger Games). The comic banter between the two 'crazies', is the high point of the film and is probably why it's garnered so many positive reviews. There's a highly amusing scene where Pat and Tiffany compare the ill effects of various psychotropic medications they've both taken in the past. They also bump into one another in the neighborhood while taking their daily runs--both feel their personal space is being invaded and they end up trading blunt insults with one another.In the best scene in the film, when Pat goes on a date with Tiffany at a diner, Pat goes too far and implies that Tiffany's illness is far worse than his. Tiffany storms out of the diner, knocking over all the plates on the table, and then out on the street accuses him of being arrogant and putting her down, in a moment where she's revealed her vulnerable side to him. But Tiffany also goes too far, falsely accusing Pat of 'harassment' in front of a crowd of people, who believe he's about to assault her. The unlikely appearance of the police officer who has been assigned to monitor Pat, prevents the crowd from assaulting him.The rest of 'Silver Linings' is pure 'Hollywood'. Tiffany agrees to give Nikki, Pat's letter, in exchange for him helping her in the dance competition. Wouldn't you know it, but suddenly Pat is becoming much more serious and responsible as he practices with Tiffany for the competition. More unlikely goings on: Pat's father makes a parley bet with his friend that if his beloved Eagles beats the Dallas Cowboys in an upcoming football game and Pat and Tiffany score at least a 5 out of 10 in the dance competition, he'll win enough money to open a restaurant.The outcome of the bet, of course, is a fait acompli, and sure enough, 'crazy' Pat ends up crazy only in the sense that he falls in love with Tiffany, and decides that Nikki is a thing of the past.You've really got to suspend your disbelief that bipolar people such as Pat can so easily overcome their problems, merely through the love of a good woman. In the end, however, 'Silver Linings' strives to be simple, good, clean fun, with a Hollywood ending to boot. But I can't help but feel that the initial 'edginess' of the principals is lost, when they finally do shack up. Thus whatever comic energy is extant during the second act, pretty much dissipates by the end of the third. If you like the trade-off, you won't have any problems with the denouement. For me, the air in the 'Silver Linings' tire, ended up being sucked out faster than you can say, 'failed eccentric romantic dramedy'.",2,'Crazies' bond as 'Dancing With The Stars' meets 'One flew over

This is quite a challenge for the poor guy, still traumatized by visions of his ex-wife cavorting in the shower of their once happy home with another man--who made the discovery even worse by telling Cooper's shocked and cuckolded character ""you should leave.""  Clearly, such an interloper richly deserved a pounding--and that is indeed what he received at the hands of our protagonist--who landed in the slammer as a result--a terrible injustice if there ever was one!So now we find our poor hero, alone except for his eccentric parents (his father a rabid Philadelphia Eagles fan banned from his beloved stadium because of a fight he once precipitated) and his good-natured shrink who hails from south Asia.  But never fear!  The up-to-now unlucky fellow soon stumbles upon Jennifer Laurence's hot and emotionally-damaged widow next door--whose caustic and often lewd observations complete her persona as something that dreams are made of!  Sadly, however, Cooper's still traumatized and seethingly hostile fellow only has eyes (in his imagination anyway) for the ex-wife who has placed a restraining order on him!  Still, the two immediately click, and in a way that is reminiscent of two socially-challenged high school kids--with him as the guy who's too stuck on the head cheerleader to notice the hot girl next door making eyes at him!Fear not, however!  She soon cons him into becoming her partner in a dance contest.  What's more, his old prison buddy, played wonderfully by a charming Chris Tucker, gamely teaches them how to ""black it up"" for their dance routine.  Jesus!  How Cooper's character is able to keep his hand off his now sensually gyrating dance partner (other than in a quasi-platonic dance-move way) defies the imagination!  But hey, the guy IS crazy after all!  You begin to wonder if he will EVER snap out of it!  And that's the hook of this show.  Will true love win out?  See this movie and find out!

They are usually the Hollywood version. This movie is not entirely the Hollywood version. Although I did not like it that much, and it did have some Hollywood stretching in the story, it is the closest thing I have ever seen to a real life portrayl of people with mental issues. Don't get me wrong, although it is close, it is still a far stretch from real mentally ill people.The storyline is not that great. In fact, I found it pretty bad. The Hollywood stretching, regarding the dance stuff, is simply unbelievable. It is the background acting, the simple everyday stuff, that make this movie so bizarrely interesting. Most all the actors in this movie do a great job. The family dynamics remind me of so many families I have encountered.This movie would have been a lot better if the writers had left out the implausible parts. They were just too much of a stretch and really detracted from the movie.While watching this movie, I was reminded of the TV show Roseanne.

1572992,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,B008OGIPJA,Wendy C. Rigney,"[11, 13]","It's often said that most romantic comedies or even comedy-dramas are now more paint-by-number than actual story, and that may be true, but ""Silver Linings Playbook"" manages more depth and heart than most, and, in making both halves of the prospective whole majorly messed up, also more ""real"".If you're reading this site, you likely have seen in other reviews just what the story involves, so this review won't bore you with repeating the synopsis. With that said, Pat Solitano and Tiffany Maxwell are two broken, messed up people, certainly not the usual people one would expect a romantic dramedy to focus upon, but that is actually what makes the movie different and special. With Pat's bipolar disease and struggle to get it under control and rebuild his life (and get his wife back, a running theme which leads to Tiffany and more than he bargained for), and Tiffany's propensity to use sex as a salve *and* an emotional shield (which even sort of plays into the guilt over her husband's death), these are not the usual people you would associate with a love story.And this movie is a love story, but not only for Pat and Tiffany. It is a love of family, a love of dance, a love (obsessively so) of football, and, oddly, if not love, a sort of respectful nod to mental illness without making fun of it *or* miring itself in misery. Mental instability is almost its own character in the film, working its way around from Pat to Tiffany to Pat's own OCD father (brilliantly acted by Robert DeNiro) whose football superstitions rival his son's own problems, and also to Pat's friend from the mental institution (where he was forcibly remanded to for eight months after a rage incident upon discovering his cheating wife and her lover), Danny, who is well played by Chris Tucker, who teaches Pat and Tiffany a thing or two about dancing, and the craziness of falling in love with someone just as crazy as the other person. But in combining that crazy, oddly, comes stability. All of the above - besides the aforementioned DeNiro and Tucker - are pitch perfect, including Jacki Weaver, whose role as what would be just the vanilla wife and mother in any other romance movie, is filled with an extra ""something"" that allows her not to fade into the shadows against Cooper, DeNiro, or Lawrence, the latter three who, admittedly, make this movie shine. Lawrence, for being so young, shows that she is no fluke, has acting chops, and deserved that Lead Actress Oscar for her effort. The fact that Weaver, Cooper and, I believe DeNiro, were also nominated is no accident, either. A stellar cast only elevates what is already a terrific screenplay, also rare for the usual rom-com.To be clear, Pat and Tiffany are not meant as ""poster children"" for the mentally ill, so those who may initially want to steer clear because of the subject matter can rest assured, just two people who, through circumstance, manage to merge their brand of insanity into their own form of happiness and calm and focus when together. As the message of the movie says, it's about ""reading the signs"" and, if read right, those signs can lead from dark to light, a true ""silver lining"".",5,"A romantic dramedy which shows ""crazy"" is all relative...",1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,3156,"['often', 'said', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'even', 'comedy-dramas', 'are', 'now', 'more', 'paint-by-number', 'actual', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'more', 'depth', 'heart', 'most', 'making', 'halves', 'prospective', 'whole', 'majorly', 'messed', 'up', 'also', 'more', 'real', '.If', ""'re"", 'reading', 'site', 'likely', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'what', 'story', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'repeating', 'synopsis', 'said', 'Pat', 'Solitano', 'Tiffany', 'Maxwell', 'are', 'two', 'broken', 'messed', 'up', 'people', 'certainly', 'not', 'usual', 'people', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'romantic', 'dramedy', 'focus', 'actually', 'what', 'movie', 'different', 'special', 'Pat', 'bipolar', 'disease', 'struggle', 'get', 'control', 'rebuild', 'life', 'get', 'wife', 'back', 'running', 'theme', 'Tiffany', 'more', 'bargained', 'Tiffany', 'propensity', 'use', 'sex', 'salve', 'emotional', 'shield', 'even', 'sort', 'plays', 'guilt', 'husband', 'death', 'are', 'not', 'usual', 'people', 'would', 'associate', 'love', 'story.And', 'movie', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'love', 'family', 'love', 'dance', 'love', 'obsessively', 'so', 'football', 'oddly', 'not', 'love', 'sort', 'respectful', 'nod', 'mental', 'illness', 'making', 'fun', 'miring', 'misery', 'Mental', 'instability', 'almost', 'own', 'character', 'film', 'working', 'way', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'Pat', 'own', 'OCD', 'father', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'football', 'superstitions', 'rival', 'son', 'own', 'problems', 'also', 'Pat', 'friend', 'mental', 'institution', 'where', 'was', 'forcibly', 'remanded', 'eight', 'months', 'rage', 'incident', 'discovering', 'cheating', 'wife', 'lover', 'Danny', 'who', 'well', 'played', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'who', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'thing', 'two', 'dancing', 'craziness', 'falling', 'love', 'someone', 'just', 'as', 'crazy', 'other', 'person', 'combining', 'crazy', 'oddly', 'stability', 'above', 'aforementioned', 'DeNiro', 'Tucker', 'are', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'including', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'role', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'vanilla', 'wife', 'mother', 'other', 'romance', 'movie', 'filled', 'extra', 'something', 'not', 'fade', 'shadows', 'Cooper', 'DeNiro', 'Lawrence', 'latter', 'three', 'who', 'admittedly', 'make', 'movie', 'shine', 'Lawrence', 'being', 'so', 'young', 'fluke', 'acting', 'chops', 'deserved', 'Lead', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'effort', 'fact', 'Weaver', 'Cooper', 'believe', 'DeNiro', 'were', 'also', 'nominated', 'accident', 'either', 'stellar', 'cast', 'only', 'what', 'already', 'terrific', 'screenplay', 'also', 'rare', 'usual', 'rom-com.To', 'be', 'clear', 'Pat', 'Tiffany', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'poster', 'children', 'mentally', 'ill', 'so', 'who', 'may', 'initially', 'want', 'steer', 'clear', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'circumstance', 'manage', 'merge', 'brand', 'insanity', 'own', 'form', 'happiness', 'calm', 'focus', 'when', 'together', 'message', 'movie', 'reading', 'signs', 'read', 'right', 'signs', 'can', 'lead', 'dark', 'light', 'true', 'silver', 'lining']",Silver Linings Playbook

Basically the whole story that drives these people together is weird and seems haphazard.  J. Lawrence plays a young woman who is recently widowed.  Cooper plays a man who lost his marriage to his spouse for more complicated reasons.  His wife refuses to speak to him and he spends a great deal of his energy trying to get her back.  J. Lawrence takes an immediate liking to him... and then falls in love with him almost as quickly.  We don't really get to see it happen because it's strange that she would grow so ridiculously attached to someone she doesn't even know.  At first it just seems to be a grieving soul who is looking to heal with someone- anyone.. but soon after that she apparently falls in love with him barely having known him and the audience hardly gets any warning at all.  His feelings for her are slower and therefore easier to digest.  We can see him falling in love with her throughout the film.  The focus on the father's gambling problems is also strange.  It's almost distracting because it's overdone.  So it's the writing that I have the problem with overall.  I've read some reviews that complain this movie is nothing like the book it's based on and perhaps that's where the problems lie, but I haven't read the book so to me the script just comes off as.... well... off.  Anyway, if strong performances are what you're looking for this isn't a bad pick.  The story could've used some help though.",4,The performances are great.

1572995,A3SO4SZPDNW0S3,B008OGIPJA,William Krischke,"[0, 0]","David O. Russell is making a name for himself by taking terribly conventional scripts/plots and turning out remarkably original movies full of life and energy.  He did it first with ""Three Kings,"" but then again, and with more accolades with ""The Fighter,"" which on paper was just another movie about an underdog boxer, but on screen was fascinating, funny, and one of the best sports films to come along in years.  And now he's back with ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" and he's doing the same thing for the romantic-comedy-amongst-kooks genre.Bradley Cooper plays a guy fresh out of a mental hospital after nearly beating his wife's lover to death.  He's trying hard to be better, and even harder to convince everyone else that he's better.  His friends hook him up with Jennifer Lawrence, who, since her cop husband died in a freak accident, has slept with nearly everyone in town.  The motives of his friends are questionable.  Are they trying to get him laid so that he'll forget about his ex-wife?  That's super sketchy, since Lawrence is clearly dealing with her own craziness and needs people around her who will protect her, not enable her.But then it becomes clear that just about everyone in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is some kind of crazy. It's sort of the mirror image of ""Arrested Development.""  In that show, Jason Bateman thinks he's the only sane one surrounded by a bunch of lunatics, but really, he's just as nuts as everyone else.  Here, Bradley Cooper thinks he's the one with mental issues surrounded by normal people, but everyone else is just as insane as he is.Take, for instance, his father, played by Robert De Niro.  He's a bookie and a passionate, superstitious Eagles fan.  He honestly seems to think that the way he holds a certain handkerchief has an effect on the outcome of the game.  De Niro believes that Cooper watching the game with him makes a difference. That's insane.  Betting on it is even more insane.  That's a weird pressure to put on somebody - I'm betting heavy because I believe you're good luck and the Eagles are going to win because you're at the game.  Not playing IN the game, AT the game.  You can't do anything REAL to help the team win the game, you can't take the field and catch a touchdown pass, so if they lose and you were there being good luck, what then?  You didn't do enough? Didn't do what enough? If my dad bet all he had on a  football game because he believed that my good luck presence was going to determine the game - me one out of 50,000 fans attending, 150,000 watching -- I would have a nervous breakdown right then and there.Lawrence is the hero of the film because instead of resisting everyone's  craziness, she just meets them in it.  In the best sequence of the movies (and one of the best sequences in movies, period,)  instead of telling De Niro that he's insane to think that his son's relationship with her is detrimental to the Eagles, she just goes with it.  And she's done her research.  I love the way this whole sequence is filmed, directed and acted.  There are so many characters involved, really involved in this scene; there's so much energy to it.  The plot mechanics are pretty straight forward; you need to film a confrontation scene that ends with this crazy bet upon which the rest of the film will be predicated. But the way it's handled is so loose -- and frenetic -- that it really feels like a situation that just evolves into what it becomes. Nothing feels forced. And so a really implausible plot point -- the calling card of nearly all romantic comedies -- feels honestly believable.All of ""Silver Linings Playbo0k"" feels messy, loose and thrown together.  At first glance, you'd think the director is hardly in control of what's going on here.  But on closer look, it becomes clear that this madness is by design.  For instance.  Russell uses the editing, and the score, to create a sense of things happening too fast, which I think is supposed to be how Cooper feels about the world - there are just too many things happening, too fast, both inside and outside of his head, for him to deal with them all.  If everything would just slow down a little, he might be all right.  But everything escalates.  On top of that, Russell gets great, fully invested performances from everyone involved.  That's no easy task, and I wonder what his secret is. Some of these actors, I've never seen them working this hard. Others, De Niro in particular, look like he just woke up from a long nap of acting in silly and stupid movies. I've stopped watching movies just because Robert De Niro is in them, but I'll hazard a guess - he hasn't been this invested since he directed himself in ""The Good Shepherd.""This is a heck of a movie, and David O. Russell is a heck of a director, someone I'll definitely be watching in years to come.  His movies are alive in a way a lot of movies aren't, and they're really fun and intriguing to watch.",4,Turning rom com conventions on their head,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,4923,"['David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'making', 'name', 'taking', 'terribly', 'conventional', 'scripts/plots', 'turning', 'out', 'remarkably', 'original', 'movies', 'full', 'life', 'energy', 'did', 'first', 'Three', 'Kings', 'then', 'again', 'more', 'accolades', 'Fighter', 'paper', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'underdog', 'boxer', 'screen', 'was', 'fascinating', 'funny', 'one', 'best', 'sports', 'films', 'come', 'along', 'years', 'now', 'back', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'romantic-comedy-amongst-kooks', 'genre.Bradley', 'Cooper', 'guy', 'fresh', 'mental', 'hospital', 'nearly', 'beating', 'wife', 'lover', 'death', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'better', 'even', 'harder', 'convince', 'everyone', 'else', 'better', 'friends', 'hook', 'up', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'cop', 'husband', 'died', 'freak', 'accident', 'slept', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'town', 'motives', 'friends', 'are', 'questionable', 'Are', 'trying', 'get', 'laid', 'so', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'ex-wife', 'super', 'sketchy', 'Lawrence', 'clearly', 'dealing', 'own', 'craziness', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'protect', 'not', 'enable', 'her.But', 'then', 'clear', 'just', 'everyone', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'kind', 'crazy', 'sort', 'mirror', 'image', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'show', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'only', 'sane', 'one', 'surrounded', 'bunch', 'lunatics', 'really', 'just', 'as', 'nuts', 'everyone', 'else', 'Here', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'one', 'mental', 'issues', 'surrounded', 'normal', 'people', 'everyone', 'else', 'just', 'as', 'insane', 'is.Take', 'instance', 'father', 'played', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'bookie', 'passionate', 'superstitious', 'Eagles', 'fan', 'honestly', 'think', 'way', 'certain', 'handkerchief', 'effect', 'outcome', 'game', 'De', 'Niro', 'Cooper', 'watching', 'game', 'difference', 'insane', 'Betting', 'even', 'more', 'insane', 'weird', 'pressure', 'put', 'somebody', ""'m"", 'betting', 'heavy', 'believe', ""'re"", 'good', 'luck', 'Eagles', 'are', 'going', 'win', ""'re"", 'game', 'Not', 'playing', 'IN', 'game', 'AT', 'game', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'REAL', 'help', 'team', 'win', 'game', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'field', 'catch', 'touchdown', 'pass', 'so', 'lose', 'were', 'there', 'being', 'good', 'luck', 'what', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'enough', 'Did', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'enough', 'dad', 'bet', 'all', 'had', 'football', 'game', 'believed', 'good', 'luck', 'presence', 'was', 'going', 'determine', 'game', 'one', '50,000', 'fans', 'attending', '150,000', 'watching', 'would', 'have', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'right', 'then', 'there.Lawrence', 'hero', 'film', 'instead', 'resisting', 'everyone', 'craziness', 'just', 'best', 'sequence', 'movies', 'one', 'best', 'sequences', 'movies', 'period', 'instead', 'telling', 'De', 'Niro', 'insane', 'think', 'son', 'relationship', 'detrimental', 'Eagles', 'just', 'done', 'research', 'love', 'way', 'whole', 'sequence', 'filmed', 'directed', 'acted', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'involved', 'really', 'involved', 'scene', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'are', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'need', 'film', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'crazy', 'bet', 'rest', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'predicated', 'way', 'handled', 'so', 'loose', 'frenetic', 'really', 'situation', 'just', 'what', 'Nothing', 'feels', 'forced', 'so', 'really', 'implausible', 'plot', 'point', 'calling', 'card', 'nearly', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'feels', 'honestly', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbo0k', 'feels', 'messy', 'loose', 'thrown', 'together', 'first', 'glance', ""'d"", 'think', 'director', 'hardly', 'control', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'closer', 'look', 'clear', 'madness', 'design', 'instance', 'Russell', 'editing', 'score', 'create', 'sense', 'things', 'happening', 'too', 'fast', 'think', 'supposed', 'be', 'how', 'Cooper', 'world', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'happening', 'too', 'fast', 'head', 'deal', 'everything', 'would', 'just', 'slow', 'down', 'little', 'might', 'be', 'right', 'everything', 'escalates', 'top', 'Russell', 'great', 'fully', 'invested', 'performances', 'everyone', 'involved', 'easy', 'task', 'wonder', 'what', 'secret', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'working', 'hard', 'Others', 'De', 'Niro', 'particular', 'look', 'just', 'woke', 'up', 'long', 'nap', 'acting', 'silly', 'stupid', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'stopped', 'watching', 'movies', 'just', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', ""'ll"", 'hazard', 'guess', ""n't"", 'been', 'invested', 'directed', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'heck', 'movie', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'heck', 'director', 'someone', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'watching', 'years', 'come', 'movies', 'are', 'alive', 'way', 'lot', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'really', 'fun', 'intriguing', 'watch']",Silver Linings Playbook

Thoughts are effects NOT causes.  Stop telling us thinking positive helps anyone.  Manipulate contingencies to make people feel good and shape effective humanism.  There is no self initiating force in the universe, much less the brain.  Thoughts have never caused human behavior so shut up and stop making movies as ignorant as Silver Linings Playbook! We have thoughts and they are effects produced by interactions with the environment. Thoughts are side effects.  They are not causes for behavior.  Nobody has ever seen a thought cause behavior, never, they are only said to be causes of behavior because they are paired with behavior at times and that is coincidental reinforcement, superstitious behavior AND superstitious behavior causes problems.  Causes happen 100% of the time.  People many times think they are going to go upstairs and go downstairs, sometimes they just sit there.  Thus, thoughts are superfluous.  Evolution could never select a thought to cause behavior for every situation, not only that natural selection couldn't select a different thought as thoughts are unique according to every individuals unique conditioning, there is no evidence thoughts cause behavior and undeniable evidence that they don't cause behavior.  Humans behave because of their environmental history, evolutionary history and the current situation. NOT descriptions. People behave the way they do regardless of what they think.  How many times does a person say he will not engage in sex and thinks it is a sin, but does so if presented with the opportunity. I mean, causes have to happen 100% of the time and anyone can talk of an example where a persons thoughts were the opposite of their behavior.  Please stop regurgitating your superstitious assertions, they are counter productive to improving the human condition.People behave according to six causes:1. Genetic Endowment2. Pre-natal chemical environment3. Post-natal chemical environment4. Pavlovian Conditioning: stimulus-stimulus-response5. Skinnerian Conditioning: stimulus-response-consequence6. Traumatic factorsThese causes for behavior work through generalization, discrimination, avoidance behavior, punishment, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, etc....  Human behavior is complicated, but there are real world variables that determine behavior NOT thoughts.  You sheople that continue to regurgitate superstitious rhetoric like behavior is caused by thoughts are ruining any chance we have of understanding human behavior.  Learning to manipulate real world variables is the only behavior that will allow us to be healthy and happy!

If, however, you are like me and really don't know anything about bipolar-ism, the humor in the movie will still keep you enjoying it throughout.For a basic plot summary, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" sees Pat (Bradley Cooper), a diagnosed bi-polar sufferer, being released from a mental institution and trying to fit back into his family and society at large.  This includes a father (Robert De Niro) who is a die-hard Eagles fan and is as superstitious as they come, a friend (John Ortiz) completely treading water in his marriage, and a mother (Jacki Weaver) who is always caught in the middle.  It is only after Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow battling multiple personal demons of her own, that he realizes the lengths he must go to in order to succeed in battling his illness.At heart, this is a film about mental illness and its effects on everyday life.  If you have experienced similar situations, the storyline will likely touch you on a very deep level.  Yet, just the humor of some of the situations this crazy family puts itself in will easily be enough to keep your interest level high.  The moral of the story is that we are all a little ""screwed up"" on some level, but we just need to find that ""silver lining"" to get through life.  Whether those themes touch you a little bit or a lot, there is enough comedy to keep things from really bogging down.Plus, even if all else fails for you in the viewing process, there is the appeal of watching the two beautiful leads.  Lawrence is showcased in enough workout outfits and dance costumes to perk up males in the audience, while I hear the ladies like Mr. Cooper just a tad as well.Overall, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a solid movie, though not really an all-time classic.
