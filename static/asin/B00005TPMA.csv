Afterall, with great rewards, come great responsibility.As one who fully accepts that you are what you desire and act upon, this movie hit the spot.

682402,AHSY48775P8RI,B00005TPMA,Avalon Daughter,"[2, 6]","Anyone who has ever seen the documentary &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization: The Metal Years&quot; knows that the 80s rock scene was shallow, full of drugs and broken dreams and that many aspiring musicians don't make it.  In comparison, &quot;Rock Star&quot; touched on those aspects, but not enough.Based on a fact (this really did happen to the band of Judas Priest) a cover band singer who works as a copier technician tries out for the band Steel Dragon and makes it as their front man.  His dream comes true but surprisingly (of course) he realizes that his fantasy isn't necessarily what he dreamed it would be.The overall attitude of the movie pretty much nails the 80s hands-down.  Unfortunately, whenever a period piece is done, there are always elements of the current period it is filmed in that are overlooked.  Hairstyles, for example, were MUCH bigger from what I remember and always look fried.  But, this is a small technicality and I digress.The first half of the movie is good -- and believable for that matter.  We see Walburg and Aniston making a concerted effort to hand out flyers for his cover band only to interact with a rival band ripping them down and replacing them with theirs (something that happened frequently in Los Angeles.) We see their relationship with each other deepen as the movie begins to progress, we see them attend concerts, interact everyday life, and we see Walburg try to keep his dream of becoming a star while making a living clash with each other (he ties his hair back while wearing a suit as a Xerox machine technician -- also becoming frustrated with a coworker who notices leftover mascara on him and doesn't understand why he's wearing it.)  Of course, this is the first half of the movie.The second half is where it gets unbelievable.  We know that Walburg's character makes it as the lead singer of Steel Dragon, but what he goes through is so lightly touched upon, we feel cheated out of what the real story might be.  For instance, &quot;Izzy&quot; gets into lots of alcohol, but we only see him out of control for a moment.  Realistically, bands then that abused drugs crashed and burned -- and then some.  Izzy has a moral conscious -- he hesitates with a number of choices.  From messing around with groupies, to going nuts with his paycheck to being denied writing any songs in the band.  He actually &quot;thinks&quot; things through and begins to reject his newfound fame.  Logically speaking, for a character such as Izzy who has such an obsession with the band, I don't believe tht he would begin to reject it for an isnant.Aniston, who is stuck with a bad script, is too smart for the groupie role that she was given.  With the smart-alec responses she comes up with and the way she delivers them, it seems that they took Rachel from &quot;Friends&quot; and jumped back 20 years with her role; she does not expand as an actress in this movie, only reincarnating her role.&quot;Rock Star&quot; is good, but not a classic.  It's fun to watch for the 80s nostalgic aspect, but it just isn't realistic.  All the serious issues of becoming a star, such as drugs and bankruptcy are really either brushed over or ignored and therefore losing credibility.  I don't blame Walburg or Aniston -- they were stuck with a mediocre script, unfortunately, and their characters were too smart for the movie to make a happy, unbelievable ending.Recommended for anyone who wants to relive the 80s and laugh at it.",3,Not bad -- but not a classic,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,3471,"['Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Decline', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'Metal', 'Years', 'quot', '80s', 'rock', 'scene', 'was', 'shallow', 'full', 'drugs', 'broken', 'dreams', 'many', 'aspiring', 'musicians', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'comparison', 'quot', 'Rock', 'Star', 'quot', 'touched', 'aspects', 'not', 'enough.Based', 'fact', 'really', 'did', 'happen', 'band', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'cover', 'band', 'singer', 'who', 'copier', 'technician', 'out', 'band', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'front', 'man', 'dream', 'true', 'surprisingly', 'course', 'fantasy', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'what', 'dreamed', 'would', 'be.The', 'overall', 'attitude', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', '80s', 'hands-down', 'Unfortunately', 'whenever', 'period', 'piece', 'done', 'are', 'always', 'elements', 'current', 'period', 'filmed', 'are', 'overlooked', 'Hairstyles', 'example', 'were', 'MUCH', 'bigger', 'what', 'remember', 'always', 'look', 'fried', 'small', 'technicality', 'digress.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'good', 'believable', 'matter', 'see', 'Walburg', 'Aniston', 'making', 'concerted', 'effort', 'hand', 'out', 'flyers', 'cover', 'band', 'only', 'interact', 'rival', 'band', 'ripping', 'down', 'replacing', 'theirs', 'something', 'happened', 'frequently', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'see', 'relationship', 'other', 'deepen', 'movie', 'progress', 'see', 'attend', 'concerts', 'interact', 'everyday', 'life', 'see', 'Walburg', 'try', 'keep', 'dream', 'becoming', 'star', 'making', 'living', 'clash', 'other', 'hair', 'back', 'wearing', 'suit', 'Xerox', 'machine', 'technician', 'also', 'becoming', 'frustrated', 'coworker', 'who', 'leftover', 'mascara', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'wearing', 'course', 'first', 'half', 'movie.The', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'unbelievable', 'know', 'Walburg', 'character', 'lead', 'singer', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'what', 'through', 'so', 'lightly', 'touched', 'feel', 'cheated', 'what', 'real', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'instance', 'quot', 'Izzy', 'quot', 'lots', 'alcohol', 'only', 'see', 'control', 'moment', 'Realistically', 'bands', 'then', 'abused', 'drugs', 'crashed', 'burned', 'then', 'Izzy', 'moral', 'conscious', 'number', 'choices', 'messing', 'around', 'groupies', 'going', 'nuts', 'paycheck', 'being', 'denied', 'writing', 'songs', 'band', 'actually', 'quot', 'quot', 'things', 'begins', 'reject', 'newfound', 'fame', 'Logically', 'speaking', 'character', 'such', 'Izzy', 'who', 'obsession', 'band', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'tht', 'would', 'begin', 'reject', 'isnant.Aniston', 'who', 'stuck', 'bad', 'script', 'too', 'smart', 'groupie', 'role', 'was', 'given', 'smart-alec', 'responses', 'up', 'way', 'took', 'Rachel', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'jumped', 'back', '20', 'years', 'role', 'not', 'expand', 'actress', 'movie', 'only', 'reincarnating', 'role.', 'quot', 'Rock', 'Star', 'quot', 'good', 'not', 'classic', 'fun', 'watch', '80s', 'nostalgic', 'aspect', 'just', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'serious', 'issues', 'becoming', 'star', 'such', 'drugs', 'bankruptcy', 'are', 'really', 'either', 'brushed', 'ignored', 'therefore', 'losing', 'credibility', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Walburg', 'Aniston', 'were', 'stuck', 'mediocre', 'script', 'unfortunately', 'characters', 'were', 'too', 'smart', 'movie', 'make', 'happy', 'unbelievable', 'ending.Recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'relive', '80s', 'laugh']",N/A

682408,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B00005TPMA,Carlisle Wheeling,"[2, 3]","I used to be a hairband rocker chick in the 80s, and some people used to call me ""the Great White girl"" because I always wore a jagged shell necklace that looked like shark's teeth.  I used to drink lots of whiskey cokes, wore stilettos, had big hair, and had a thing for a guitarist named Dave (No last name, because I don't want him to remember me, as if he does anyway).  I lived and breathed this genre in my late teens and twenties, sometimes detouring for a break with new age music, smooth jazz, and classic rock.  While I no longer listen to very much of the music in this film, I still regard those times with an awkward and sheepish affection.  That's why it took so long to view this movie.  Mark Wahlberg, who emerged as a rapper playing a siren voiced lead vocalist in a hair band?  Well, I broke down and watched it, but I have to say I wasn't impressed.True, the male actors had the stupid looks we used to sport down, but the dialog was beyond cringe-inducing, and Jennifer Aniston had no place in this movie at all.  He wig was 60s/70s hippie-ish--not the big permed, ratted look we went for, and she seemed not to even understand what her role was all about.  Wahlberg's character's vocals were supplied by a largely underrated and fierce vocalist named Mike Matijevic, formerly of the early 90s hairband Steelheart who I used to go wild over, and who deserved proper credit for his contribution.  That brings up the fact that appearances by the likes of Slaughter's Blas Elias and Dokken's Jeff Pilson do nothing to lend credibility to the shoddy storyline, let alone the fact that a Rainbow song was handed off as a Steel Dragon original.  The only very appealing actor in the entire movie is the always excellent Timothy Spall.You may well look at this movie and grin because the music and the overall basic look will remind you of where you once used to be, but the movie is an insulting letdown on too many levels to count.  The alternative rock scene destroyed our way of life, yet they have Wahlberg's character go that route at the end.  I won't say other performers of the genre didn't try it too, but none of them were successful either because their older fans were highly displeased with the change.  This movie seems to be saying, much like MTV did, ""thank God THAT'S over!""  Is that the kind of movie you want to use as an example of what the 80s hard rock scene was all about?  Well, you may buy it, but I don't, and it's obvious nobody behind this drudge gave a flying frig about telling the truth about an era that gets further away by the years.  Instead of this movie, I recommend Still Crazy (which also features Timothy Spall as crazy Strange Fruit drummer Beano), Spinal Tap, or Almost Famous.  I remember 80s hairbands with crystal clear clarity, and they deserve a much better homage than this.",2,2 1/2 Stars.

Most rock films deal with the artist's struggle to achieve fame. 'Rock Star' uses a deus ex machina mid-way through that would strain your suspension of disbelief were it not based on a true life story of the heavy metal band, Judas Priest. Singer Rob Halford quit due to internal tension and creative differences. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, who had previously sung in a Judas Priest tribute band called British Steel, was hired in 1996 as Judas Priest's new singer.This saga forms the basis for 'Rock Star' and the second half concerns itself with ""grass is always greener,"" be careful what you wish for. Though Judas Priest disavowed any connection to 'Rock Star' as it was only tangentially based on their situation, a cult following formed for the band in the movie, Steel Dragon, among some heavy metal and Judas Priest fans. I am not surprised to hear that, because the music for the movie was quite good, though I am not a fan of the genre. Most of the actors playing the rock musicians were in fact actual musicians. For instance, Jason Bonham, son of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, played the drummer. Others were from bands such as Dokken, Ozzy Osbourne, and Third Eye Blind. Some also worked on the soundtrack. And they wisely chose not to use Mark Wahlberg's voice and dubbed in Mike Matijevic, lead singer of Steelheart. Markie Mark and the Funky Bunch not withstanding, Wahlberg is not a singer, as he himself freely admits. His actual voice was heard in 'Boogie Nights' where Dirk Diggler attempts to launch a singing career, but fails miserably. He wasn't trying to sound bad on purpose, rather, that was as good as Wahlberg could do.I think his acting in 'Rock Star' was actually superior to 'Boogie Nights' but Stephen Herek is no match for Paul Thomas Anderson as a director. Jennifer Aniston also turned in a nuanced performance as girlfriend/manager Emily Poule. She is overly familiar as Rachel Green from the TV sit com 'Friends,' but managed to melt into her role quite nicely, nevertheless. Lately she has given another great edgy performance that you should try and catch, though it is an independent film destined for limited theatrical release. Her performance in 'Management' is very 'touch-and-go.'Also notable were Timothy Spall and Dagmara Dominczy. Spall was Matts, the Steel Dragon's road manager, at turns both avuncular and satanic. Dominczy was sizzling as the Dragon's publicist, especially in an after concert dance scene where she seduces both Aniston and Wahlberg into the Rock and Roll lifestyle.So, though the rock musicians and groupies that made up the rest of the cast couldn't really act, they were essentially just playing themselves and added immensely to the authenticity. The heavy dramatic lifting was done by Aniston and Wahlberg. There is a lot of good natured mocking of wannabe rock stars, but there is also some respect paid to their craft and the level of their success.

Mark Wahlberg does a surprisingly good job playing a rockstar.  Jennifer Aniston does a pretty decent job, although I think she usually plays the same type of charachter in every movie.  This movie is basically about a guy named Chris Cole(Wahlberg) who sings in a tribute band that plays songs by his favorite band, Steel Dragon.  He copies everything about Steel Dragon and is completely obsessed with them.  Anyways, one day Steel Dragon calls him up and asks him to come audition to be their lead singer.  He makes it, and his dreams come true.  That's not the end though, but I'm not gonna tell you the rest.  I will tell you one thing though:it's pretty predictable.  I'm not saying that this is a bad movie though, it's very enjoyable.  Also, Zakk Wylde plays guitar for the fictional band, and is in the movie a bit, and of course he's an incredible guitarist.

682418,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00005TPMA,Darren,"[1, 1]","I suspect the director is precisely my age, which would place both of us at 16 back in 1985, when most of this movie takes place.  Only someone who was 16 back then would be honest enough to present the idolatry we rockers accorded to the gods of the arenas.  1985 was likely the very peak year for arena rock, the culmination of the backlash against the several years of New Wave that had preceded this peak.  Young viewers watching this movie might find Wahlberg's worship of the movie's fictional band, Steel Dragon (PERFECT name, btw), to be exaggerated, but they would be quite wrong.  Let me tellya kids, back in the day we rocked without irony, without snark.  We wore their T-shirts that we bought at their concerts.  We doodled their band logos on our Pee-Chee folders.  Adolescents require heroes, especially as we discover that our parents, our teachers, our Presidents are just normal people who are as full of it as anyone else.  For many of us in the Eighties, big-haired rockers filled the bill: their wild appearance and behavior perhaps symbolized some sort of freedom that we thought we didn't have, and the loud crunching music provided the perfect conduit to express our rages and disappointments and confusions.  Not even Reiner's &#34;This is Spinal Tap&#34; from 84 could change our minds: we laughed at it, and then bought the soundtrack without irony.  Some of us were even inspired enough to want to play the music ourselves, and heroes like Eddie Van Halen were meticulously imitated.  Wahlberg's character, who is a frontman for a &#34;tribute&#34; band that homages the movie's fictional British rock group, is NOT an exaggeration.In fact, he's based on a real guy who became the lead singer for Judas Priest after that band's singer left.  The members of &#34;Steel Dragon&#34; get hold of a videotaped performance of Wahlberg's &#34;tribute&#34; band, and then ask him to audition to be their new singer.  And, just like what happened in real life to Tim &#34;Ripper&#34; Owens, the Dream Comes True.But not without cost, of course.  Wahlberg and his girlfriend Aniston wind up at debauched parties, waking up in different rooms with different people.  We get the obligatory Wives/Girlfriends Scene, much like the one in &#34;Goodfellas&#34;, where the female lead has to sit and listen to demented advice from the Ball-And-Chain Veterans Agency.  All this proves to be a bit much for Aniston and she thereafter becomes essentially Mom for a while, and finally disappears for a good while longer, while Wahlberg continues his slide into alcoholic confusion about which city he's in.  I found all this quite uninteresting, as it's been done so many times before.  I enjoyed the movie mainly for the music, which includes some original stuff that isn't bad; far more convincing, really, than Cameron Crowe's &#34;Stillwater&#34; from &#34;Almost Famous&#34;, which was supposed to be Seventies but was clearly Nineties.  It was interesting to see the fundamental conservatism of hard rock bands.  When Wahlberg comes in with his own material, the old Steel Dragon pros remind him who's boss and explain that any deviation from the &#34;formula&#34; could result in the end of their careers.  Of course, those careers ended anyway, precisely because the hair-band guys couldn't evolve.  The opening chords to &#34;Smells like Teen Spirit&#34; were their death-knell.I guess I'm finally just fascinated with the notion that, at some point in the early to mid Eighties in Pittsburgh, there was a Judas Priest tribute band, an amazing fact that accounts for this movie's existence in the first place.  I mean: really?  When I think tribute bands, I think note-for-note, which implies covering a famous band that has produced difficult material that you can't just wing in your garage.

682419,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005TPMA,D. Litton,"[34, 43]","For what it's worth, ""Rock Star"" is an enjoyable fantasy yarn about an aspiring musician who makes it to the big time, only to realize that it's not all about sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll. Sure, the concept is surely not fresh, and the lack of purpose that plagues the movie keeps it from truly soaring. But despite its flaws, it manages to entertain through its bright cast, wonderful execution, and delightful sense of humor.Carrying the lightweight story on his shoulders like a guitar case full of memories is young Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg), a twenty-something grunge rocker who still lives with his parents, and gets his jollies by recreating the sense of excitement an audience gets from attending a Steel Dragon concert. Insisting that his band is a ""tribute band"" rather than a cover band, Chris idolizes the band, particularly the lead singer, Bobby Beers, whom he looks, sounds, and acts like on stage.With the support of his mother and father, as well as his longtime girlfriend Emily (Jennifer Aniston), Chris finds comfort in his fanaticism, perhaps too much comfort. His drive to recreate each song specifically and correctly makes him overbearing in the eyes of his band members, who, after an on-stage brawl, decide it's time for Chris to walk.In any other movie, this would be the complete story, ending with reflections by each of the characters on how their experiences together shaped the rest of their lives. But in the world of ""Rock Star,"" this is only the beginning. Just when Chris begins to give up his dreams, he gets a call from none other than Kirk Cuddy, one of Steel Dragon's guitarists, offering him a chance to audition as the new lead singer. He heartily accepts, flies out with Emily to meet the band and begins to get into the life of a rock star, all the while paying little notice to his past life, which slips away more and more each day.This cautionary turn of events that begin to cloud the jubilance of Chris's lifestyle is a well-known tactic used by many other films that bear the routine grass-isn't-always-greener-on-the-other-side warning. The film shows us both the glamour and the depression of this lifestyle, from the excessive drinking and parties where Chris is surrounded by adoring female fans, to a scene in which Emily is told by the wife of another band member that since Chris is a rock star, ""the normal rules don't apply."" At times, however, I got the feeling that the movie is warning against the rock-and-roll way of life it has been embracing all along.So what is the film's position? Neither, really; its inability to take a stand for or against this lifestyle is bothersome only if you allow it to be. If you can put this inconsistency aside, you'll find that there's a whole lot of fun to be had with the movie. Some impressive work is done in creating a fictional 80's rock band, complete with long, tossed hair and mascara during performances, screaming guitars and singing that resembles a screeching tire. It may not be as authentic a recreation as, say, the era of ""Almost Famous,"" but it gets the job done with fashionable results.Mark Wahlberg has always been a versatile actor, and proves his worth with this role. As Chris, he manages to convincingly segue from a controlling perfectionist obsessed with precisely recreating Steel Dragon, to a legend at the top of his game and the bottom of his personal life. It's nothing stellar, but he carries it so well, with all the brazen charm of an 80's rock idol/sex symbol. Of the band members, Timothy Spall's character is the most memorable, a humorous mix of wit and longing for the stability of his past. Jennifer Aniston practically steals every scene she walks through, crossing moments of real emotion with some of the film's funniest one-liners. At one point, a groupie begins talking about G-strings gaining more respect for exotic dancers, to which Aniston replies, ""Nothing says 'respect' like cramming a strip of Lycra right up your a--.""There's an air of familiarity that hangs over the movie that is hard to ignore, but what keeps it from becoming too formulaic are its wonderful cast, its comedic wit, and its interesting premise. There's nothing totally hardcore about it, but it hardly matters, since we already know this is going to be an uplifting movie rather than a downbeat adventure of self-discovery. As a cautionary fantasy, ""Rock Star"" is too routine to remain with one for long, but while you're there, it's quite an experience.",4,"""Rock Star"" is routine, but still a lot of fun.",1011916800,"01 25, 2002",2002,4479,"['what', 'worth', 'Rock', 'Star', 'enjoyable', 'fantasy', 'yarn', 'aspiring', 'musician', 'who', 'big', 'time', 'only', 'realize', 'not', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock-and-roll', 'Sure', 'concept', 'surely', 'not', 'fresh', 'lack', 'purpose', 'movie', 'truly', 'soaring', 'flaws', 'entertain', 'bright', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'execution', 'delightful', 'sense', 'humor.Carrying', 'lightweight', 'story', 'shoulders', 'guitar', 'case', 'full', 'memories', 'young', 'Chris', 'Cole', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'twenty-something', 'grunge', 'rocker', 'who', 'still', 'parents', 'jollies', 'recreating', 'sense', 'excitement', 'audience', 'attending', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'concert', 'Insisting', 'band', 'tribute', 'band', 'rather', 'cover', 'band', 'Chris', 'band', 'particularly', 'lead', 'singer', 'Bobby', 'Beers', 'whom', 'acts', 'stage.With', 'support', 'mother', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'Emily', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Chris', 'comfort', 'fanaticism', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'comfort', 'drive', 'recreate', 'song', 'specifically', 'correctly', 'overbearing', 'eyes', 'band', 'members', 'who', 'on-stage', 'brawl', 'decide', 'time', 'Chris', 'walk.In', 'other', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'story', 'ending', 'reflections', 'characters', 'how', 'experiences', 'together', 'shaped', 'rest', 'lives', 'world', 'Rock', 'Star', 'only', 'beginning', 'Just', 'when', 'Chris', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'call', 'none', 'other', 'Kirk', 'Cuddy', 'one', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'guitarists', 'offering', 'chance', 'audition', 'new', 'lead', 'singer', 'heartily', 'out', 'Emily', 'meet', 'band', 'get', 'life', 'rock', 'star', 'while', 'paying', 'little', 'notice', 'past', 'life', 'away', 'more', 'more', 'day.This', 'cautionary', 'turn', 'events', 'begin', 'cloud', 'jubilance', 'Chris', 'lifestyle', 'well-known', 'tactic', 'used', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'bear', 'routine', ""grass-isn't-always-greener-on-the-other-side"", 'warning', 'film', 'glamour', 'depression', 'lifestyle', 'excessive', 'drinking', 'parties', 'where', 'Chris', 'surrounded', 'adoring', 'female', 'fans', 'scene', 'Emily', 'told', 'wife', 'band', 'member', 'Chris', 'rock', 'star', 'normal', 'rules', 'do', ""n't"", 'apply', 'times', 'however', 'got', 'feeling', 'movie', 'warning', 'rock-and-roll', 'way', 'life', 'been', 'embracing', 'along.So', 'what', 'film', 'position', 'really', 'inability', 'take', 'stand', 'lifestyle', 'bothersome', 'only', 'allow', 'be', 'can', 'put', 'inconsistency', 'aside', ""'ll"", 'find', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'movie', 'impressive', 'work', 'done', 'creating', 'fictional', '80', 'rock', 'band', 'complete', 'long', 'tossed', 'hair', 'mascara', 'performances', 'screaming', 'guitars', 'singing', 'screeching', 'tire', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'authentic', 'recreation', 'say', 'era', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'job', 'done', 'fashionable', 'results.Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'always', 'been', 'versatile', 'actor', 'worth', 'role', 'Chris', 'convincingly', 'segue', 'controlling', 'perfectionist', 'obsessed', 'precisely', 'recreating', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'legend', 'top', 'game', 'bottom', 'personal', 'life', 'nothing', 'stellar', 'so', 'well', 'brazen', 'charm', '80', 'rock', 'idol/sex', 'symbol', 'band', 'members', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'character', 'most', 'memorable', 'humorous', 'mix', 'wit', 'longing', 'stability', 'past', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'practically', 'scene', 'crossing', 'moments', 'real', 'emotion', 'film', 'funniest', 'one-liners', 'one', 'point', 'groupie', 'talking', 'G-strings', 'gaining', 'more', 'respect', 'exotic', 'dancers', 'Aniston', 'replies', 'Nothing', 'cramming', 'strip', 'Lycra', 'right', 'up', 'air', 'familiarity', 'movie', 'hard', 'ignore', 'what', 'becoming', 'too', 'formulaic', 'are', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'comedic', 'wit', 'interesting', 'premise', 'nothing', 'totally', 'hardcore', 'hardly', 'matters', 'already', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'rather', 'downbeat', 'adventure', 'self-discovery', 'cautionary', 'fantasy', 'Rock', 'Star', 'too', 'routine', 'remain', 'one', 'long', ""'re"", 'there', 'quite', 'experience']",N/A

There is a great dance floor scene where Mark Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston and members of the band, Steel Dragon, are taking a mind-altering drug to the pulsating sound of Ted Nugent's ""Strangelhold"" that definately stands out to the classic rock fan.

This film had the unfortunate fate of being released on the week of Sept 11, so, it escaped any box office, and, no doubt, mostly scathing reviews. This rags to riches to rags to ""wisdom"" tale has been told before, but rarely with this much unintentional fun. Mark Wahlberg plays an unknown singer in a cover rock band (he insists on calling it a ""tribute"" band, for dignity's sake) who, through twists of drama and unrealistic fate, becomes the lead singer of the very famed band that he worships/mimics. Fast forward to all the predictable excesses and temptations that one would expect, and, voila!...you've got your basic rock story of virtually any of those tacky, big hair, 1980's bands such as Poison, Motley Crue, Whitesnake, Cinderella, etc...that were so inexplicably popular yet had their 15 minutes before rock with ""meaning"" a.k.a., The Seattle Sound, sent them all to a quick death, or, at best, on  unending tours into Hell via reunion concerts and third hand venues. But, admittedly, this story is somewhat different. Every straight boy wanted to be a rock star, yet, this is one of the campiest films ever. There are the usual seedy liquor strewn hotel rooms, and numerous hung-over mornings in said hotel rooms, waking up to groupies, twisted bodies, drug remnants, and bad breath. But, there's also transvestites, queens, and some very campy/drama loaded scenes, ala the best '50s melodramas. You can't for a moment take this film seriously, it would ruin the laughs. Jennifer Aniston, God bless her, plays the highschool sweetheart turned rock mama/manager of Wahlberg's screeching rock God, and, well....she's just not believeable, even in this tale where belief MUST be suspended. Though she is lovely, she's much more convincing as the girl next door with a twist than as some hot rock mama, hair extensions and glitter eye shadow aside. Her certain scenes with real life rock floozies such as Rachel Hunter seem to only confirm this. I don't want to spoil this fun-fest, I will only say that it is worth watching in spite of its total predictability, and one isn't surprised when Wahlberg emerges transformed as a true artist with ""feelings' at the conclusion, a poor man's Eddie Vedder.

Harvey ""Cricket ,country music and a go...","[1, 1]","It is the 1980's and young Chris Cole is living at home with his supportive  parents and somewhat tight sphinctered brother .He works as a photocopier repair man but his real love is heavy metal music and particularly the British band Steel Dragons.He is lead vocalist in a tribute band and obsessive about every aspect of performance, sporting the requisite leonine mane and favoring the leather jacket over bare chest stage attire of the man he is copying all the while insisting that every guitar solo and drum riff is exactly as it is on record.This perfectionism results in the break up of his band but the pain is dulled when he is summoned by the real group to take over when they fire their lead singer.From then on he and his girl friend Emily are swept up into the world of the rock star-the trashing of hotel rooms ,the steady parade of women ,booze and drugs in between flasy arena gigs.The relationship is strained to breaking point and gradually Chris begins to see that he needs to carve out his own route to some kind of place in the music business.Wahlberg is perfect in the role both in the looks and voice department and Jennifer Aniston is  competent as Emily but for me the movie was stolen by a beautifully judged performance from Timothy Spaull as the bands road manager cum Mr Fix it.His scenes with Wahlberg are wryly played with just the right note of relaxed cameraderie and an underlying edge of sadness and regret.Good to see a British character in a Hollywood movie who is shown as a good guy just trying to do his best for his friends and colleagues.The band too are humanised and not portrayed as caricature figures although they are control freaks and slightly patronising of the new addition to their ranks.I am not a fan of the music but you do not need to be to enjoy a modern day Cinderella story with believable and decent people at its heart.However if you do like the big hair bands of the era all the better for your enjoyment of the movie",3,Sweet natured Cinderella story for metal heads,1060905600,"08 15, 2003",2003,1980,"['1980', 'young', 'Chris', 'Cole', 'living', 'home', 'supportive', 'parents', 'somewhat', 'tight', 'sphinctered', 'brother', '.He', 'photocopier', 'repair', 'man', 'real', 'love', 'heavy', 'metal', 'music', 'particularly', 'British', 'band', 'Steel', 'Dragons.He', 'lead', 'vocalist', 'tribute', 'band', 'obsessive', 'aspect', 'performance', 'sporting', 'requisite', 'leonine', 'mane', 'favoring', 'leather', 'jacket', 'bare', 'chest', 'stage', 'attire', 'man', 'copying', 'while', 'insisting', 'guitar', 'solo', 'drum', 'riff', 'exactly', 'record.This', 'perfectionism', 'results', 'break', 'band', 'pain', 'dulled', 'when', 'summoned', 'real', 'group', 'take', 'over', 'when', 'fire', 'lead', 'singer.From', 'then', 'girl', 'friend', 'Emily', 'are', 'swept', 'up', 'world', 'rock', 'star-the', 'trashing', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'steady', 'parade', 'women', 'booze', 'drugs', 'flasy', 'gigs.The', 'relationship', 'strained', 'breaking', 'point', 'gradually', 'Chris', 'see', 'carve', 'out', 'own', 'route', 'kind', 'place', 'music', 'business.Wahlberg', 'perfect', 'role', 'looks', 'voice', 'department', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'competent', 'Emily', 'movie', 'was', 'stolen', 'beautifully', 'judged', 'performance', 'Timothy', 'Spaull', 'bands', 'road', 'manager', 'cum', 'Mr', 'Fix', 'it.His', 'scenes', 'Wahlberg', 'are', 'wryly', 'played', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'relaxed', 'cameraderie', 'underlying', 'edge', 'sadness', 'regret.Good', 'see', 'British', 'character', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'who', 'shown', 'good', 'guy', 'just', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'friends', 'colleagues.The', 'band', 'too', 'are', 'humanised', 'not', 'portrayed', 'caricature', 'figures', 'are', 'control', 'freaks', 'slightly', 'patronising', 'new', 'addition', 'ranks.I', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'music', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'enjoy', 'modern', 'day', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'believable', 'decent', 'people', 'heart.However', 'do', 'big', 'hair', 'bands', 'era', 'better', 'enjoyment', 'movie']",N/A

Add the fact that Mark Wahlberg has become a top-notch actor, and you have one of the most fun movies around today!Although some might say that this movie is the typical feel-good story where dreams come true if you stick by your guns, but it really is more than that.  This is also a movie of someone that had a passion, and with a serious stroke of luck, got to expand on that passion to the ultimate level.In my opinion, Jennifer Aniston had little, if any chemistry with Wahlberg, and that may have been the one down side to this movie.  However, the rest of the acting, fused with the story more than makes up for that mishap.  Along with the story, is some really solid songs and singing (a special thanks to Miljenko Matijevic from the band Steelheart for lending his vocals!)  which really will have you rocking with the band throughout the movie!What I like most about the movie, is how it seems to come full-circle.  Mark Wahlberg has lived the dream, he then reaches a cross-roads where he must make a desicion to continue or not?!

Cole has immersed himself in the life of their lead singer and goes so far as getting piercings from his girlfriend/manager Emily Poule, Jennifer Anniston, to emulate Steel Dragon's lead singer.Chris' lowest day comes when his band rebels and kicks him out. They are more interested in performing their own music and he wants to continue honoring Steel Dragon.  Why would he want to take a chance on his own music when he knows this hard pounding rock is the best?  His highest day comes when he gets a phone call from Steel Dragon's lead guitarist.  It seems that some groupies who were currently ""partying"" with the guitaristhad made a tape of one of Chris' performances.  This just happened to coincide with Steel Dragon dumping their lead singer.  Before he can fully process it, Chris and Emily have flown to the audition, and now he finds himself as the lead singer of his favorite band.After a shaky start, Chris fully establishes himself as their lead singer and his dream is fulfilled.  That is until Emily moves off on her own.  Chris drowns his sorrow in a full tilt dose of ""sex, drugs, and rock and roll"" living the life of every aspiring heavy metal singer and only slowly begins to realize the ironies of living your dream.If the sound of screaming guitars, power chords, synthesizers, and vocals doing things the human voice wasn't meant to do, frequently come from yourcd player...this movie is for you.  If you remember fondly the big hair of the 80s, the leather and spandex clad musicians, and the term ""GlamRock""...this movie is for you.I thoroughly enjoyed this one as did, much to her surprise, my wife. Walhberg looks like a kid in a candy store when he is up singing with the band and as an actor, he continues to get better and better. Don't stop watching when the credits role either.  Walhberg is talking at one point during the credits and ""Marky Mark"" bursts forth from the depths for a brief bit that is hysterical.  Jennifer Aniston actually did a decent job in this oneplaying someone other than ""Rachel"".The music was what really drove the movie.  I'm not necessarily talking about the actual performance but the pursuit of music.  It was evident in Cole's heart that is what truly mattered to him and he was really only alive when on the stage.  The actual performance was fun.  I know many of the 80s Rock Icons are on the sound track as is ""Steel Dragon"".

The band he once covered asks HIM to be their new lead singer.  The motto of his life on stage being ""I was once just a fan like you, staring at posters of ""Steal Dragon"" on my wall, and now I'm living my fantasy!"".  Hip Hip Hooray for Chris (Walberg). He is the only part of this movie that works.The script lacks severely in many places. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? You are never quite sure.  I laughed through the first 25 minutes, relishing Chris's scenes with his older brother who is a cop, but soon the movie lost it's entertainment value.I was also disappointed with Jennifer Aniston...she could never quite convince me she wasn't Rachael Green in 80's clothes.  Her role as Chris's girlfriend should have been more sexy.  Maybe Charlize Theron, in heavy make-up could have pulled it off.I think the most fun I had in the movie was looking for Mark Walberg's ""third nipple"" through the body make-up (it's true! I swear).  He was topless through most of the scenes and still sexy even clad in leather and mascara.

682444,A10BWW5GU19AD,B00005TPMA,Jeff Wiley,"[2, 2]","""Rock Star"" is a movie that recreates the hard rock era that was the 1980s. Bands of all types of metal (from pop to death) benefited from the popularity that metal experienced during that time, and this movie helps recreate that time for people (like myself) who were young then, and are thankful that they grew up during those years.By now, almost everyone knows that this movie is loosely based on Tim ""Ripper"" Owens of Judas Priest fame, but it doesn't draw heavily from his real-life story. Instead, ""Rock Star"" creates its own identity, and delivers the story of a rock fan who didn't find his dream, but had his dream find him. Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston (both of whom are very good actors, and somewhat underrated) turn in good performances.The soundtrack is, in a word, phenomenal. There are several original songs recorded by the members of the fictional Steel Dragon band represented in the film. In fact, many of the musicians who recorded the original songs portray their fictional counterparts in the movie. Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne's band, Black Label Society), Jason Bonham (who pounded the skins for his own band, Bonham, as well as being the son of legendary Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham), Jeff Pilson (Dokken), among others, were recruited to bring this band's music to life. For their efforts alone, this movie gets points.One could say that ""Rock Star"" was overlooked at the box office. Then again, this movie could be considered a ""niche"" movie, as many younger people who are part of the current hip-hop generation would have a tough time appreciating it. It also is obviously targeting the 80s metal crowd as its audience. If you were a part of that time and miss it, as I do, you will very much enjoy this movie.",4,"A great, overlooked rock and roll fantasy movie",1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,1750,"['Rock', 'Star', 'movie', 'hard', 'rock', 'era', 'was', '1980s', 'Bands', 'types', 'metal', 'pop', 'death', 'benefited', 'popularity', 'metal', 'experienced', 'time', 'movie', 'recreate', 'time', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'young', 'then', 'are', 'thankful', 'grew', 'up', 'years.By', 'now', 'almost', 'everyone', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'Tim', 'Ripper', 'Owens', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'fame', ""n't"", 'draw', 'heavily', 'real-life', 'story', 'Instead', 'Rock', 'Star', 'own', 'identity', 'story', 'rock', 'fan', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'dream', 'had', 'dream', 'find', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'whom', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'somewhat', 'underrated', 'turn', 'good', 'performances.The', 'soundtrack', 'word', 'phenomenal', 'are', 'several', 'original', 'songs', 'recorded', 'members', 'fictional', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'band', 'represented', 'film', 'fact', 'many', 'musicians', 'who', 'recorded', 'original', 'songs', 'portray', 'fictional', 'counterparts', 'movie', 'Zakk', 'Wylde', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'band', 'Black', 'Label', 'Society', 'Jason', 'Bonham', 'who', 'pounded', 'skins', 'own', 'band', 'Bonham', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'son', 'legendary', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'drummer', 'John', 'Bonham', 'Jeff', 'Pilson', 'Dokken', 'others', 'were', 'recruited', 'bring', 'band', 'music', 'life', 'efforts', 'alone', 'movie', 'points.One', 'could', 'say', 'Rock', 'Star', 'was', 'overlooked', 'box', 'office', 'Then', 'again', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'niche', 'movie', 'many', 'younger', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'current', 'hip-hop', 'generation', 'would', 'have', 'tough', 'time', 'appreciating', 'also', 'obviously', 'targeting', '80s', 'metal', 'crowd', 'audience', 'were', 'part', 'time', 'miss', 'do', 'will', 'very', 'much', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A

682452,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005TPMA,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 3]","""Rock Star"" is a movie that tells the story of a copy-machine repair man named Chris Coles (Mark Wahlberg) who is in a tribute band honoring his favorite band Steel Dragon. Chris Coles doesn't just sing the bands songs, he hits every note perfectly, dresses up to look exactly like lead singer Bobby Beers (Jason Fleyming), and knows everything about the band. The other members of his band eventually get mad about his obsession and kick him out of the band. Just when things are looking down for Chris, he gets a call from the guitarist of Steel Dragon, Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West) to audition for the band. Along with his girlfriend/manager Emily (the beautiful Jennifer Aniston), Chris auditions and becomes a member of the band with the monkier Izzy. Frankly, it's a pretty original story but towards the end (even though I liked the ending) it gets cliched a bit. When the movie I started, I thought it was going to be horrible because the first 30 minutes or so of the movie paint a portrait of Chris as being an obsessed, wimpy, and possibly gay man who likes and worships a band way too much. Some of the dialouge in this 30 minutes is really bad and the delivery just makes it worse, although it does supply a good laugh or two. After Chris joins the band the movie picks up a little bit and Wahlberg starts to work. In fact, Wahlberg's performance is one of his best. The movie also features Black Label Society/Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde as Ghode, another guitarist for the Steel Dragon; Jason Bonham, son of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, as A.C. the drummer; and Timothy Olymphant as the guitarist of Chris's tribute band. The movie also happens to be loosely based on a true story. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, singer in a Judas Priest tribute band, actually joined the band when vocalist Rob Halford quit. Ripper Owens, like Chris Coles, worshipped Judas Priest and was able to hit every note Halford could hit and if you've ever listened to Priest, that's pretty impressive. But, it's only LOOSELY based. But, the movie is entertaining while kind of cheesy.GRADE: A-",4,"Kind of Idiotic, But Entertaining",1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,2074,"['Rock', 'Star', 'movie', 'story', 'copy-machine', 'repair', 'man', 'named', 'Chris', 'Coles', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'tribute', 'band', 'honoring', 'favorite', 'band', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'Chris', 'Coles', ""n't"", 'just', 'sing', 'bands', 'songs', 'note', 'perfectly', 'up', 'look', 'exactly', 'lead', 'singer', 'Bobby', 'Beers', 'Jason', 'Fleyming', 'everything', 'band', 'other', 'members', 'band', 'eventually', 'get', 'mad', 'obsession', 'kick', 'band', 'Just', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'down', 'Chris', 'call', 'guitarist', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'Kirk', 'Cuddy', 'Dominic', 'West', 'audition', 'band', 'girlfriend/manager', 'Emily', 'beautiful', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Chris', 'auditions', 'member', 'band', 'monkier', 'Izzy', 'Frankly', 'pretty', 'original', 'story', 'end', 'even', 'liked', 'ending', 'cliched', 'bit', 'When', 'movie', 'started', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'horrible', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'paint', 'portrait', 'Chris', 'being', 'obsessed', 'wimpy', 'possibly', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'band', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'dialouge', '30', 'minutes', 'really', 'bad', 'delivery', 'just', 'worse', 'supply', 'good', 'laugh', 'two', 'Chris', 'band', 'movie', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'Wahlberg', 'work', 'fact', 'Wahlberg', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'also', 'Black', 'Label', 'Society/Ozzy', 'guitarist', 'Zakk', 'Wylde', 'Ghode', 'guitarist', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'Jason', 'Bonham', 'son', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'drummer', 'John', 'Bonham', 'A.C.', 'drummer', 'Timothy', 'Olymphant', 'guitarist', 'Chris', 'tribute', 'band', 'movie', 'also', 'be', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Tim', 'Ripper', 'Owens', 'singer', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'tribute', 'band', 'actually', 'joined', 'band', 'when', 'vocalist', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'quit', 'Ripper', 'Owens', 'Chris', 'Coles', 'worshipped', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'was', 'able', 'hit', 'note', 'Halford', 'could', 'hit', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'listened', 'Priest', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'only', 'LOOSELY', 'based', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'kind', 'cheesy.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

682454,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B00005TPMA,Kasey G,"[2, 2]","While I'm not a fan of Mark Wahlberg's action flicks, ""Boogie Nights"" remains one of my favorite films ever in large part to his performance as rising porn star ""Dirk Diggler"". In some ways, ""Rock Star"" is like the '80s version of ""Boogie Nights"", though it's nowhere near as good an ensemble piece.Wahlberg plays a 20-something Xerox technician in Pittsburgh, whose life revolves around being lead singer in a tribute band to his favorite metal group, the fictional ""Steel Dragon"". In-fighting and conflict within the group causes Wahlberg to walk and take manager/girlfriend Jennifer Aniston with him. Soon thereafter, he's being asked to audition as lead singer for the REAL Steel Dragon and live the envious (or is it?) life of the titular Rock Star.Yes, the script is a little predictable and the message is old: Fame's a monster that tears people apart and ruins relationships and lives and leaves one feeling empty. But the movie is a fun ride for anyone who was into the metal/hard rock scene back in the '80s. Steel Dragon seems to be a composite based on several bands including Judas Priest (gay lead singer), Def Leppard and Van Halen. The scene where Mark's about to go onstage for the first time as a replacement is excellent as the audience can feel his nervousness and momentary self-doubt.There are some fun, unexpected moments such as the 'morning after' scene following the nightclub sequence. Timothy Olyphant is great but underused. Watch for the moment when he sees his former bandmate on a TV press conference. That slight smile speaks volumes. The script cleverly mirrors several earlier scenes as when Steel Dragon's lead singer walks out on the band and later when Mark starts experiencing tension within the group.The soundtrack features the likes of Kiss, Bon Jovi and Def Leppard but some of the incidental background music is very late-'90s sounding which takes away from the period feel.Anyone who was into the metal scene in the '80s will probably like this one.

Jennifer Anniston is equally believable as his manager/girlfriend,  even though her looks never seem to suffer too much from the rigors of the road...somehow the heavy partying and group sex never quite leave her less than picture-perfect, without even a bit of smudged mascara on her checks or a trace of dullness in her blue eyes.

682461,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005TPMA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","""Rock Star"" was clearly inspired by the real-life story of Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, who was the singer for a Judas Priest cover band who ended up replacing lead singer Rob Halford when he left the real heavy metal band.  But the story of Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) only uses that as a springboard for this morality fable about the world of rock `n' roll set back in the middle-1980s.  Chris is the lead singer for Blood Pollution, which he repeatedly insists is not a cover band but a ""tribute"" band to the heavy metal giants Steel Dragon and their fiery frontman Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng).  While Rob (Timothy Olyphant), the lead guitarist for Blood Pollution and the other boys in the band want to use the Steel Dragon songs to draw in an audience so they can play their own songs, Chris demands absolute fidelity to the songs of his gods of music.  Fate then gets Chris booted from the band at the same time that Beers is walking away from Steel Dragon and the rest is music movie history.This 2002 film spends more time with the off stage excesses available in the world of rock `n' roll than on the concert performances, because as soon as Chris is on stage living the life he has always dreamed about, the nightmare side of the equation starts to come into play.  What matters if a man gains his dream as a heavy metal superstar if he loseth his longtime girlfriend, Em (Jennifer Aniston)?  By the time his life literally comes full circle, Chris has come to a few realizations about who he is and what he really wants out of life and once again the old Chinese proverb about being careful what you wish for is enacted for us on screen.The problem with ""Rock Star"" is reconciling two particular scenes.  The first happens when Chris is told he has gone off the deep end by his friend Rob, who wants to do more than perfectly imitate what is on the record in terms of a career in music.  But Chris has carved out new terrain that is well beyond the realm of obsession and cannot even understand what Rob is running on about let alone accent the obviously valid criticism.  The second happens when Chris wants to write some songs for Steel Dragon and is told his creativity is neither appreciated nor wanted.  Of course there is an attendant element of irony here, but I found it impossible to believe that this was the same guy in both of these scenes.  Chris might be calling himself ""Izzy"" as the band's lead singer, but that is just a fantasy construct for the masses and not the real him (not that the real Chris has many moments in most of this film).Wahlberg does not do his own singing in this film, which might explain why he never really looks like he is getting into the part (and for being in a hair band he has one of the worst mops of the bunch).  The songs are giving rather short shrift in the film: the song that Chris uses for his audition and which comes into play again during his first concert has some possibilities, but apparently nothing else was written after the high note.  Actually the best song in ""Rock Star"" comes at the end of the film and constitutes a rather declarative statement from director Stephen Herek on where he stands on the world of heavy metal.The two most compelling characters in the film are a pair of supporting players, Jennifer Aniston as the long-time girlfriend and part-time manager for Chris and his band, and Timothy Spall as Mat the Steel Dragon's road manager.  Aniston keeps finding her way into films that have little use for her beyond being the iconic girl next door for her generation, and this film is certainly no different.  But she does have some nice moments as the last person to lose her head to the insanity that is rock `n' roll and if Chris is going to look at one thing and realize what he is throwing away it might as well be looking at Jennifer Aniston.  Spall plays the font of all wisdom, who has seen absolutely everything there is to be seen from backstage and still remembers the exact moment that he derailed his own life.  It is his performance that anchors the film and when Chris listens to him we know that he would be a fool not to.In the end, ""Rock Star"" is oddly disappointing.  There are some nice moments and Chris ends up where he should be, with whom he should be and playing the sort of music he should be, but you cannot shake the feeling that the character takes too long to realize what everybody else already knows.  Only when Em is around does Chris really seem alive and ultimately the film is more about the two of them than it is about Chris and his music.  Then again, the point is that for most of the film is it most decidedly NOT his music that Chris is singing.  Certainly worth a look for music fans, even if heavy metal is not their favorite, but no where as endearing or captivating as ""Almost Famous.""

682470,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005TPMA,Matthew Horner,"[6, 11]","I think you have to appreciate heavy metal music to get off on Rock Star. I like all kinds of music, but I think the common denominator for me is music with soul. Some heavy metal is okay, but most of it sounds angry and cacophonous, rather than soulful and melodic. Still, I suspect many fans of this branch of rock and roll won't be that impressed with the movie. It isn't satirical enough to be another This is Spinal Tap. It's certainly not in the same league as Almost Famous. The story is middle-of-the-road and predictable, which seems to me to be the antithesis of heavy metal folklore.Mark Wahlberg, who, of course, was once a real pop music star called Marky Mark, plays Chris Cole, the lead singer in a tribute band that imitates a wildly popular group called Steel Dragons. His manager / girlfriend is Emily [Jennifer Anniston]. She doesn't much believe in the tribute band, but she does believe in Chris's talents, both on stage and off. When the lead singer of Steel Dragons is fired, the group's leader calls a disbelieving Chris and invites him to audition. Chris and Emily fly from their Pennsylvania hometown to Los Angeles. He gets the job, and they begin their lives in the big time world of sex, drugs and rock and roll. They learn soon enough that this lifestyle makes heavy demands on everything, including their relationship.What can I say about Mark Wahlberg? It's hard to jump from one career to another in show business and get the respect you deserve. Because of the notoriety he got in his pop star days, a lot of people won't admit that he's one of the best actors in movies today. Oddly (or perhaps not), he seems a bit uncomfortable playing a rock and roll icon in this movie, though he's still the main reason to see it. Jennifer Anniston is once again a sort of question mark to me. She seems quite talented in her role in the long running TV comedy series, Friends, but her movie performances have never impressed me. Maybe the right role hasn't come along, or maybe she's lucky to have made it big in TV.Some people have said that Rock Star feels authentic, but I thought it was very stagy. Though the big production numbers, filmed in front of thousands of extras, are professional and obviously expensive, they don't have the edge and electricity one has come to expect in the MTV music video era. There are a few scenes that ring true, like the one in which Chris is so exhausted from being on the road for months that he doesn't even know what city he is in. His and Emily's introduction to the sex and drugs aspect of the business seems fairly accurate. The rest, though, rings false. It plays like every fan magazine's fantasy of life in rock and roll.About halfway through, the movie breaks down. The second half is meant to show how disillusioned Chris becomes with the business. It all gets painfully predictable. The climax is supposed to be ironic yet touching. Instead, it leaves us wondering if maybe Chris's real problem is that he doesn't have what it takes to make it.",2,"Rock Star lacks vibrancy, authenticity",1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,3020,"['think', 'have', 'appreciate', 'heavy', 'metal', 'music', 'get', 'off', 'Rock', 'Star', 'kinds', 'music', 'think', 'common', 'denominator', 'music', 'soul', 'heavy', 'metal', 'okay', 'most', 'angry', 'cacophonous', 'rather', 'soulful', 'melodic', 'Still', 'suspect', 'many', 'fans', 'branch', 'rock', 'roll', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'impressed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'satirical', 'enough', 'be', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'certainly', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'story', 'middle-of-the-road', 'predictable', 'be', 'antithesis', 'heavy', 'metal', 'folklore.Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'course', 'was', 'once', 'real', 'pop', 'music', 'star', 'called', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'Chris', 'Cole', 'lead', 'singer', 'tribute', 'band', 'wildly', 'popular', 'group', 'called', 'Steel', 'Dragons', 'manager', '/', 'girlfriend', 'Emily', '[', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', ']', ""n't"", 'much', 'believe', 'tribute', 'band', 'believe', 'Chris', 'talents', 'stage', 'off', 'When', 'lead', 'singer', 'Steel', 'Dragons', 'fired', 'group', 'leader', 'disbelieving', 'Chris', 'audition', 'Chris', 'Emily', 'fly', 'Pennsylvania', 'hometown', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'job', 'begin', 'lives', 'big', 'time', 'world', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'learn', 'soon', 'enough', 'lifestyle', 'heavy', 'demands', 'everything', 'including', 'relationship.What', 'can', 'say', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'hard', 'jump', 'one', 'career', 'show', 'business', 'get', 'respect', 'deserve', 'notoriety', 'got', 'pop', 'star', 'days', 'lot', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'movies', 'today', 'Oddly', 'perhaps', 'not', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'playing', 'rock', 'roll', 'icon', 'movie', 'still', 'main', 'reason', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'once', 'again', 'sort', 'question', 'mark', 'quite', 'talented', 'role', 'long', 'running', 'TV', 'comedy', 'series', 'Friends', 'movie', 'performances', 'have', 'never', 'impressed', 'Maybe', 'right', 'role', ""n't"", 'come', 'along', 'maybe', 'lucky', 'have', 'made', 'big', 'TV.Some', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'Rock', 'Star', 'authentic', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'stagy', 'big', 'production', 'numbers', 'filmed', 'front', 'thousands', 'extras', 'are', 'professional', 'obviously', 'expensive', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'edge', 'electricity', 'one', 'come', 'expect', 'MTV', 'music', 'video', 'era', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'ring', 'true', 'one', 'Chris', 'so', 'exhausted', 'being', 'road', 'months', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'city', 'Emily', 'introduction', 'sex', 'drugs', 'aspect', 'business', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'rest', 'though', 'rings', 'false', 'fan', 'magazine', 'fantasy', 'life', 'rock', 'roll.About', 'halfway', 'movie', 'down', 'second', 'half', 'meant', 'show', 'how', 'disillusioned', 'Chris', 'business', 'painfully', 'predictable', 'climax', 'supposed', 'be', 'ironic', 'yet', 'touching', 'Instead', 'wondering', 'maybe', 'Chris', 'real', 'problem', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'make']",N/A

If you're the kind of person, who likes her music the lighter, the more singalong, the better, then that doesn't matter. It's Mark Wahlberg on screen isn't it? And it's so far, the first film I've seen where Jennifer Aniston does not play Rachel. The soundtrack is very rocky, and not something I would normally go out of my way to listen to, but apart from that, the film is excellent.Rock Star will certainly strike a chord with all the dreaming musicians/singers out there, who dream of being on stage, taking the place of the lead singer, and rocking out. This happens to Mark Wahlberg's character, and he lives the life in a rock band. Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll? Everything is covered in this film, including (almost) losing his faithful girlfriend/manager, played by Jennifer Aniston (gorgeous hair extensions and clothes by the way).Jennifer plays the character well, and actually makes you forget she ever played a character called Rachel. She does very well, and there's chemistry between her & Mark. She looks gorgeous throughout, and she has a happy ending in the film.I have never seen a Mark Wahlberg film before, all I knew that he is an easy on the eye body. I've never seen Boogie Nights, but am planning to rectify that at some point. But he is lovely in this film - despite the ratty hair extensions (not a good look), and the nipple piercing OUCH.Rock Star is an amazing film, and will definitely suit people better who like rock music.

Carnegie,"[38, 41]","First of all let me start off by saying that although Rock star didn't do very well at the box office, I thought it was a lot of fun and it made for an enjoyable hour and three quarters viewing. Loosely based on the life of Tim `Ripper' Owens, the office supplies salesman who replaced Rob Halford in Judas Priest, Rock Star combines  satire, morality, romance and a good old fashioned rags to riches storyline.So what's the plot? Salesman and ordinary working stiff Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) and wannabe rock star has been obsessed for years in his devotion to British heavy metal band Steel Dragon. As part of a tribute band, he is derided by his older brother who feels he should get a real job and his devotion to mimicry is so much that even his fellow tribute band members are sick of him, and they eventually dump him. Comforted by his patient and devoted girlfriend (Jennifer Anniston) Chris swears that he will prove them all wrong but he even he is shocked when he is invited to audition as the replacement singer in the band he adores. Of course he wins the gig and so begins a journey through the world of a rock idol, full of drugs, groupies, drink and general excessive behaviour.I'm not quite sure why this movie wasn't that successful. Sure it's not the greatest movie you will ever see and it offers no original insight but there's also very little to dislike about it. Critics may complain that it's neither full on satire such as `This Is Spinal Tap' or that it is full of clich&eacute;s but this is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and does not try to portray reality. Mark Wahlberg is perfectly cast as Chris Cole and Jennifer Anniston gives a very pleasing and likeable performance as Chris's loyal girlfriend, whilst some of the supporting turns (particularly from Timothy Spall as the seen it all before manager) are excellent too. Stephen Herek's direction is perfectly paced and unlike most modern movies it is not overlong and it feels shorter than it actually is. It has some truly excellent moments and you could do much worse than to check this out on a Saturday night.",4,"GOOD FUN, WORTH WATCHING!!!",1013299200,"02 10, 2002",2002,2114,"['First', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'Rock', 'star', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'thought', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'hour', 'three', 'quarters', 'viewing', 'Loosely', 'based', 'life', 'Tim', 'Ripper', 'Owens', 'office', 'supplies', 'salesman', 'who', 'replaced', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'Rock', 'Star', 'combines', 'satire', 'morality', 'romance', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'rags', 'riches', 'storyline.So', 'what', 'plot', 'Salesman', 'ordinary', 'working', 'stiff', 'Chris', 'Cole', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'rock', 'star', 'been', 'obsessed', 'years', 'devotion', 'British', 'heavy', 'metal', 'band', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'part', 'tribute', 'band', 'derided', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'should', 'get', 'real', 'job', 'devotion', 'mimicry', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'fellow', 'tribute', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'sick', 'eventually', 'dump', 'Comforted', 'patient', 'devoted', 'girlfriend', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'Chris', 'will', 'prove', 'wrong', 'even', 'shocked', 'when', 'invited', 'audition', 'replacement', 'singer', 'band', 'course', 'gig', 'so', 'journey', 'world', 'rock', 'idol', 'full', 'drugs', 'groupies', 'drink', 'general', 'excessive', 'behaviour.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'successful', 'Sure', 'not', 'greatest', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'original', 'insight', 'also', 'very', 'little', 'dislike', 'Critics', 'may', 'complain', 'full', 'satire', 'such', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'full', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'not', 'try', 'portray', 'reality', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Chris', 'Cole', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'very', 'pleasing', 'likeable', 'performance', 'Chris', 'loyal', 'girlfriend', 'whilst', 'supporting', 'turns', 'particularly', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'seen', 'manager', 'are', 'excellent', 'too', 'Stephen', 'Herek', 'direction', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'most', 'modern', 'movies', 'not', 'overlong', 'shorter', 'actually', 'truly', 'excellent', 'moments', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'check', 'out', 'Saturday', 'night']",N/A

Who would have thought that Mark Wahlberg could pull off the role of the main character, a long haired, ""devil-sign"" gesturing, head banging, rocker?  Well he did, even the dubiously cast Jennifer Anniston made a pretty good rocker chick.So here's the story: Chris Coles (Wahlberg) LOVES the band Steel Dragon and the lead singer Bobby Beers....so much so that Chris dresses like Bobby and even sings in a popular Steel Dragon tribute band.  Chris is very talented and can mimic Bobby precisely.  Anyway, Bobby leaves the band, Steel Dragon calls up Chris for an audition (they saw a tape of his cover band and were impressed), Chris gets the jig, and now he is living out his fantasy-- to be a rock star.But Chris got a little more than he bargained for-- he didn't think about all the drugs, booze, and women that came along with the deal.  His longtime girlfriend and manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston), didn't account for all the drug orgies either and eventually she leaves Chris to pursue a career of her own.  Emily leaving starts the ball rolling and Chris begins to realize that being a rock star isn't all it's cracked up to be.Even though ""Rock Star"" was a typical and fairly predictable rags-to-riches story it was still very enjoyable.  It was delightful seeing Mark Wahlberg rock out and scream/sing power ballad lyrics...if he was really singing then I'm doubly impressed.  The soundtrack for this movie was incredible-- I had a hard time sitting still and not rocking out in my seat, heehee.

While the film plays more like a rock and roll dream come true for one young man it all seems rather contrived, predictable and simply hard to swallow. Sure these dreams of rock stardom do come true all the time. I remember when Jason Cooper of the Cure answered an add in a magazine that said Working band looking for drummer, he never dreamed that days later when he walked into the first rehersal that he was going to be standing face to face with Robert Smith of The Cure, and would become and would end up after the first try-out to be the new drummer for The Cure and remain so for nearly 17 years. Dreams like this do come true but they are few and far between. The problems with this movie I had is that the fictional band Steele Dragon are hard to swallow because they seem almost comical and in similar fashion to Spinal Tap. Though the acting is good by all and, there is some realism here and there, over all there wasnt enough to make this film truly shine as anything more than an unrealistic teenage fantasy of what it might be like to become an over night rock star. In other words the film attempts and falls short of depicting a realistic story. None the less its a fun ride and worth a look anyway.

From the previews, it appeared to be a cheesy commentary on heavy metal ala Bon Jovi. Nerveless, I was getting tired of seeing the same thing over and over again, and really though this would be different. Perhaps I would give it a chanceAm I glad I trusted my instincts on this. In the hands of lesser talents, this movie would be a complete flop, but the director was blessed with the foresight to pick the perfect storyline and cast.Walhberg plays Chris, a non-descript heavy metal fan who gets to live out his wildest dreams of playing in his favorite band when one of the initial members leaves. Fun and mayhem ensure as Chris discovers just what a Rock Star's life is really like. He even sings some of the vocals in the band's tracks.The music was so infectious, I found myself bouncing up in down in the theater seats.

Zwick,"[2, 2]","So what happens when a person's dreams actually DO come true, especially when the context of that dream turns out to be superstardom in the celebrity driven culture of modern America?  Does that individual, in attaining the summit of fame and fortune, find true happiness and fulfillment there or does he come to realize that it is all mere ashes in the long run?These questions have formed the basis for any number of films in the past and ""Rock Star"" doesn't bring much new insight to the theme.  However, in style and spirit, this film by director Stephen Herek is just loopy enough to be entertaining.  Although writer John Stockwell provides a basically superficial - and in some ways even sanitized - survey of the rock star culture, at least we are spared some of the heavy-handed rebel angst that usually accompanies films on this subject.From the beginning, the film incorporates elements that go against the grain of the subject matter.  For instance, the main character, Chris Cole, is less a wannabe rock star than an obsessed devotee of his favorite rock band known as Steel Dragon.  Chris emulates the band's adored lead singer to such an extent that the people around him - including his own band members who spend most of their time covering Steel Dragon's tunes - begin to feel that Chris might actually be having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy, that he may actually be coming to think that he IS his idol.  The screenplay also breaks out of the mold by having Chris's parents be supportive of his endeavors and by making Chris himself a rocker without a societal chip on his shoulder.  Chris simply loves rock music and the band that he feels has come to epitomize it for him.  Unlike in most of these stories, the lead character is not an ambitious, driven, trailblazing artist but rather a follower content to bask in another person's glory.Until fate one day intervenes in an astonishing way and Chris gets that rare chance to live out his ultimate life fantasy.  He receives a call from the leader of Steel Dragon who has heard Chris's renditions of their songs and offers him a job as replacement for the burnt out lead singer, Chris' idol.  At this point the film lapses into more familiar territory, with Chris and his girlfriend taking the inevitable downward spiral from wide-eyed innocence to the hedonistic trap of unbridled sex, drugs, booze etc. - and all the interpersonal strain this places on once-solid relationships.  Happily, ""Rock Star,"" although it shows all these conventional aspects, doesn't go overboard into total despair and misery as so many previous films on this topic have.  In fact, it is surprising just how upbeat the film remains even in its darkest moments.  Even though that adds to the superficial quality of the film, it also keeps it from becoming fashionably cynical and clich&eacute;d.Mark Wahlberg gives an energetic performance as Chris and Jennifer Aniston conveys a real transcendent sweetness as Emily, Chris' devoted girlfriend.  One ends up not believing a minute of ""Rock Star"" (at least not after that fateful phone call arrives), but it has a nice fairytale quality nonetheless.",3,superficial but entertaining film,1013990400,"02 18, 2002",2002,3161,"['So', 'what', 'when', 'person', 'dreams', 'actually', 'DO', 'come', 'true', 'especially', 'when', 'context', 'dream', 'out', 'be', 'superstardom', 'celebrity', 'driven', 'culture', 'modern', 'America', 'individual', 'attaining', 'summit', 'fame', 'fortune', 'find', 'true', 'happiness', 'fulfillment', 'there', 'come', 'realize', 'mere', 'ashes', 'long', 'run', 'questions', 'have', 'formed', 'basis', 'number', 'films', 'past', 'Rock', 'Star', ""n't"", 'bring', 'much', 'new', 'insight', 'theme', 'However', 'style', 'spirit', 'film', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Herek', 'just', 'loopy', 'enough', 'be', 'entertaining', 'writer', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'basically', 'superficial', 'ways', 'even', 'sanitized', 'survey', 'rock', 'star', 'culture', 'least', 'are', 'spared', 'heavy-handed', 'rebel', 'angst', 'usually', 'films', 'subject.From', 'beginning', 'film', 'elements', 'go', 'grain', 'subject', 'matter', 'instance', 'main', 'character', 'Chris', 'Cole', 'less', 'wannabe', 'rock', 'star', 'obsessed', 'devotee', 'favorite', 'rock', 'band', 'known', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'Chris', 'band', 'adored', 'lead', 'singer', 'extent', 'people', 'including', 'own', 'band', 'members', 'who', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'covering', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'tunes', 'begin', 'feel', 'Chris', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'having', 'trouble', 'distinguishing', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'coming', 'think', 'idol', 'screenplay', 'also', 'mold', 'having', 'Chris', 'parents', 'be', 'supportive', 'endeavors', 'making', 'Chris', 'rocker', 'societal', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'Chris', 'simply', 'rock', 'music', 'band', 'come', 'epitomize', 'most', 'stories', 'lead', 'character', 'not', 'ambitious', 'driven', 'trailblazing', 'artist', 'rather', 'follower', 'content', 'bask', 'person', 'glory.Until', 'fate', 'one', 'day', 'astonishing', 'way', 'Chris', 'rare', 'chance', 'live', 'out', 'ultimate', 'life', 'fantasy', 'call', 'leader', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'who', 'heard', 'Chris', 'renditions', 'songs', 'job', 'replacement', 'burnt', 'out', 'lead', 'singer', 'Chris', 'idol', 'point', 'film', 'more', 'familiar', 'territory', 'Chris', 'girlfriend', 'taking', 'inevitable', 'downward', 'spiral', 'wide-eyed', 'innocence', 'hedonistic', 'trap', 'unbridled', 'sex', 'drugs', 'booze', 'etc', 'interpersonal', 'strain', 'places', 'once-solid', 'relationships', 'Happily', 'Rock', 'Star', 'conventional', 'aspects', ""n't"", 'go', 'overboard', 'total', 'despair', 'misery', 'so', 'many', 'previous', 'films', 'topic', 'have', 'fact', 'surprising', 'just', 'how', 'upbeat', 'film', 'even', 'darkest', 'moments', 'Even', 'superficial', 'quality', 'film', 'also', 'becoming', 'fashionably', 'cynical', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Wahlberg', 'energetic', 'performance', 'Chris', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'real', 'transcendent', 'sweetness', 'Emily', 'Chris', 'devoted', 'girlfriend', 'One', 'not', 'believing', 'minute', 'Rock', 'Star', 'least', 'not', 'fateful', 'phone', 'call', 'nice', 'fairytale', 'quality', 'nonetheless']",N/A
682500,A2SPI5WNZLOJ2U,B00005TPMA,Sal Nudo,"[0, 0]","I love this underrated rock `n' roll movie for different reasons, and I think many others would as well. The passionate rock crowd could easily grasp the protagonist's unabashed belief in his craft and desire for ascension. Romantics will completely fall for the genuine spark between Chris ""Izzy"" Cole (Mark Wahlberg) and Emily Poule (Jennifer Aniston). Anyone who has ever been in a rock band could likely relate to the way this movie shows the dissensions, egos, successes, failures and brotherhood that's involved in such an undertaking. And finally, if you simply want a good story, ""Rock Star"" fits the bill.This colorful flick is authentic and dizzying in its rags-to-riches scope. Behind the satisfaction and accomplishment of the ringing telephone that announces a glorifying, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, backstage craziness, genuine work ethic and grit await. From band rehearsals full of conflict to a band manager on kidney dialysis due to too much alcohol consumption, director Allan Moyle does a fine job of making all this wildness appear true-to-life.Wahlberg is excellent as Izzy. His energy and drive to attain superstardom looks no less authentic than if it were Joe Elliott, Axl Rose or Vince Neil doing the same thing back in their day. Supposedly the plot of ""Rock Star"" follows the course of Judas Priest's journey, highlighting the period when lead singer Rob Halford was unceremoniously shown the exit door by his band mates (only to be welcomed back years later, which the movie doesn't cover). When Izzy nervously tries out for the lead-singer position within the popular 1980s arena-rock band Steel Dragon, there's an ultra-tender moment when Emily mouths ""I love you"" from behind the glass walls of the studio. Like I said, romantics will enjoy this movie.Perhaps most interestingly, the Seattle-caf&eacute;-sensitive-singer-songwriter 1990s vibe at the end of ""Rock Star"" is every bit as effective as the arena-stomping mentality and sound that dominate throughout. This can be attributed to the mesmerizing music of the Verve Pipe and Trevor Rabin; the effective on-screen chemistry between Izzy and Emily; and the fact that this aftermath ""growing up"" period is such an integral and realistic part of life.""Rock Star"" is a dramatic, super-fun movie that will appeal to a larger contingent of movie goers than one might think.",5,A rock classic,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,2361,"['love', 'underrated', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'movie', 'different', 'reasons', 'think', 'many', 'others', 'would', 'as', 'well', 'passionate', 'rock', 'crowd', 'could', 'easily', 'grasp', 'protagonist', 'unabashed', 'belief', 'craft', 'desire', 'ascension', 'Romantics', 'will', 'completely', 'fall', 'genuine', 'spark', 'Chris', 'Izzy', 'Cole', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Emily', 'Poule', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'rock', 'band', 'could', 'likely', 'relate', 'way', 'movie', 'dissensions', 'egos', 'successes', 'failures', 'brotherhood', 'involved', 'such', 'undertaking', 'finally', 'simply', 'want', 'good', 'story', 'Rock', 'Star', 'bill.This', 'colorful', 'flick', 'authentic', 'dizzying', 'rags-to-riches', 'scope', 'satisfaction', 'accomplishment', 'ringing', 'telephone', 'glorifying', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'opportunity', 'backstage', 'craziness', 'genuine', 'work', 'ethic', 'grit', 'await', 'band', 'rehearsals', 'full', 'conflict', 'band', 'manager', 'kidney', 'dialysis', 'due', 'too', 'much', 'alcohol', 'consumption', 'director', 'Allan', 'Moyle', 'fine', 'job', 'making', 'wildness', 'appear', 'true-to-life.Wahlberg', 'excellent', 'Izzy', 'energy', 'drive', 'attain', 'superstardom', 'less', 'authentic', 'were', 'Joe', 'Elliott', 'Axl', 'Rose', 'Vince', 'Neil', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'back', 'day', 'Supposedly', 'plot', 'Rock', 'Star', 'course', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'journey', 'highlighting', 'period', 'when', 'lead', 'singer', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'was', 'unceremoniously', 'shown', 'exit', 'door', 'band', 'mates', 'only', 'be', 'welcomed', 'back', 'years', 'later', 'movie', ""n't"", 'cover', 'When', 'Izzy', 'nervously', 'out', 'lead-singer', 'position', 'popular', '1980s', 'arena-rock', 'band', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'ultra-tender', 'moment', 'when', 'Emily', 'love', 'glass', 'walls', 'studio', 'said', 'romantics', 'will', 'enjoy', 'most', 'interestingly', 'Seattle-caf', 'eacute', '1990s', 'vibe', 'end', 'Rock', 'Star', 'bit', 'as', 'effective', 'arena-stomping', 'mentality', 'sound', 'dominate', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'mesmerizing', 'music', 'Verve', 'Pipe', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'effective', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Izzy', 'Emily', 'fact', 'aftermath', 'growing', 'up', 'period', 'such', 'integral', 'realistic', 'part', 'life', 'Rock', 'Star', 'dramatic', 'super-fun', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'larger', 'contingent', 'movie', 'goers', 'one', 'might', 'think']",N/A

He presides over the band with a steel fist making sure they imitate Steel Dragon to the best of their abilities. This wears thin with the other band members and when push comes to shove, Chris is shown the door. Across the country much the same scenario is playing out among the members of the real Steel Dragon. They end up needing a new lead singer. Back in Pennsylvania a phone rings. It's for Chris...My Opinion: Rock Star dragged. We all knew the call was coming. We knew what the movie was going to be about from the trailer. Yet it took a long time to get there. The story is very predictable and it pulls all its punches. Just when I thought it was going to pull itself up off the mat and land a good blow ending on a high note, they keep it going and any punch it could have had goes flat. Plus in the real world or any movie world, who would dump Jennifer Aniston? Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston do a great job, but the story keeps them from breaking free. Timothy Spall is one bright spot. He is great as the Steel Dragon road manager. He leads us through the rocky terrain of the rock and roll life. In the end I was only slightly entertained.

This real story was definitely the inspiration for this fictional tale, but just a springboard as the story departs from there.Mark Wahlberg plays Chris Cole, who is lead singer of his own cover band, &quot;Blood Pollution,&quot; that plays homage to the fictional band Steel Dragon.  Cole refers to the band as a &quot;tribute&quot; band, not a cover band, but the nomenclature seems lost on most everyone else, including his bandmates.  The other guys in the band want to spread their wings and play some of their own material, but Chris refuses and they replace him with another singer.Crestfallen, Chris attends a Steel Dragon concert and tries to enjoy himself. Front row of the mosh pit, he gets just a  few moments of fame as Steel Dragon hands the mike down to the audience. Chris does such a mind-blowing good job, Steel Dragon fires their trouble-making singer and hires Chris to take the role.His devoted girlfriend, Em (wonderfuly played by Jennifer Aniston), is supportive and excited for him, but quickly loses her enthusiasm as  Chris is forced to place their relationship on the back burner. The band insists that as a member of their group, he must hang with them on their tour bus - groupies and drugs are always welcome, but no wives or girlfriends are allowed.  In an effort to fit in, Chris soon finds himself wasted and involved in some carnal extracirricular activities with fans and others.Having found the end of the rainbow, he finds that the pot of gold is really foil-covered chocolate coins - definitely not worth the journey.

To me he will always be known as Chris/Izzy Cole in the 2001 film Rockstar. The film wasn't received greatly and didn't earn much at the box office. It seems there wasn't a huge demand at the time for a movie on 1980's Metal and other than hardcore Rock and Metal fans there wasn't a big market for it. For myself being a huge fan of the music and being passionate about it, Rockstar sort of acknowledged and celebrated what I loved about the music along with the excesses that comes with fame and made an interesting story from it. While it's often a forgotten film, Rockstar has a niche among Metal fans. In fact I've watched this film more times than I can remember and although I recognize that it's obviously not deserving of a 5 stars rating from an objective perspective and point of view. It can be seen as an over the top, silly movie project celebrating a music genre that is past its heyday with its plenty big wigs. To me it's a blast from the past and it's one of my very favorite films.As you probably know by now, Rockstar was based on the story of Tim ""The Ripper"" Owens and legendary band Judas Priest. Owens who was a huge Judas Priest fan started in JP tribute band ended up replacing singer Rob Halford when he quit the band in the early 1990's. The movie was originally taking that story and taking it to the big screen but Judas priest pulled out of the project and therefore Rockstar ended up being very different. The story however, remained the same. A young hungry unknown who sings in a tribute band to his idols is called up by the very band he lives for and gets a chance to audition for the newly opened up lead singer position that ultimately leads him to stardom. Rockstar sort of celebrates the larger than life nature of the 1980's bands, the lifestyle, the excess, the fame, the downfall etc. The fictional band in Rockstar, Steel Dragon is memorable I have to say! With the songs, characters like Bobby Beers (the original singer for Steel Dragon who is a closet homosexual like Rob Halford), the fictional tribute bands (Black Babylon?) they had it all figured out.The cast is what makes the movie work. Mark Wahlberg is very passionate and likeable in the lead role, he was a perfect choice. Jennifer Aniston is great as Emily Paule, the supportive girlfriend who becomes thrown into this rock and roll madness. I love that they got some rockers to be in Steel Dragon, most obvious of all guitarist Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black Label Society), bassist Jeff Pilson (Dokken), Jason Bonham (various projects, also the son of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham) it made the experience more ""real"" if you will. The actual music for the band Steel Dragon was actually good (I liked ""We All Die Young Especially"", and there's ""Stand Up"", ""Blood Pollution"", ""Living the Life"", ""Wasted Generation"" and the nice overall soundtrack of 80's rock music: Bon Jovi, KISS, Motley Crue, Def Leppard...). The actors couldn't sing and act of course so they brought some real rock talent in singers Jeff Scott Soto (Bobby Beers), Miljenko Matijevic (Chris/Izzy Cole) and Myles Kennedy (himself making the appearance).I thought it was interesting how the movie ended at the dawn of the 1990's with the rise of Grunge music and culture (even cutting their hair, gasp!) and it was a nice wink to the era but it goes against what the movie was about ironically. However if you're not particularly fond of 1980's Glam Rock and Heavy Metal you probably won't find the movie too exciting or much to like about it. For me Rockstar is one of those movies that I have loved to watch over and over with the years.  Yes most of the rock clich&eacute;s are there but the heart is in it too, for all its flaws Rockstar is a really enjoyable film, particularly if you're a fan of Rock/Metal but you may still enjoy it otherwise. It's not Spinal Tap, Dazed and Confused or Detroit Rock City, but it proudly carries on the torch for Rock `N'Roll.  4/5 stars.",4,Living the life,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,4086,"['Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'remembered', 'rapper', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'know', 'role', 'acting', 'career', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'known', 'Chris/Izzy', 'Cole', '2001', 'film', 'Rockstar', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'received', 'greatly', 'did', ""n't"", 'earn', 'much', 'box', 'office', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'demand', 'time', 'movie', '1980', 'Metal', 'other', 'hardcore', 'Rock', 'Metal', 'fans', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'market', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'music', 'being', 'passionate', 'Rockstar', 'sort', 'acknowledged', 'celebrated', 'what', 'loved', 'music', 'excesses', 'fame', 'made', 'interesting', 'story', 'often', 'forgotten', 'film', 'Rockstar', 'niche', 'Metal', 'fans', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'remember', 'recognize', 'obviously', 'not', 'deserving', '5', 'stars', 'rating', 'objective', 'perspective', 'point', 'view', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'top', 'silly', 'movie', 'project', 'celebrating', 'music', 'genre', 'past', 'heyday', 'plenty', 'big', 'wigs', 'blast', 'past', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'films.As', 'probably', 'know', 'now', 'Rockstar', 'was', 'based', 'story', 'Tim', 'Ripper', 'Owens', 'legendary', 'band', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'Owens', 'who', 'was', 'huge', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'fan', 'started', 'JP', 'tribute', 'band', 'ended', 'up', 'replacing', 'singer', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'when', 'quit', 'band', 'early', '1990', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'taking', 'story', 'taking', 'big', 'screen', 'Judas', 'priest', 'pulled', 'out', 'project', 'therefore', 'Rockstar', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'different', 'story', 'however', 'remained', 'same', 'young', 'hungry', 'unknown', 'who', 'tribute', 'band', 'idols', 'called', 'up', 'very', 'band', 'chance', 'audition', 'newly', 'opened', 'up', 'lead', 'singer', 'position', 'ultimately', 'stardom', 'Rockstar', 'sort', 'larger', 'life', 'nature', '1980', 'bands', 'lifestyle', 'excess', 'fame', 'downfall', 'etc', 'fictional', 'band', 'Rockstar', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'memorable', 'have', 'say', 'songs', 'characters', 'Bobby', 'Beers', 'original', 'singer', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'who', 'closet', 'homosexual', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'fictional', 'tribute', 'bands', 'Black', 'Babylon', 'had', 'all', 'figured', 'out.The', 'cast', 'what', 'movie', 'work', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'very', 'passionate', 'likeable', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'great', 'Emily', 'Paule', 'supportive', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'thrown', 'rock', 'roll', 'madness', 'love', 'got', 'rockers', 'be', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'most', 'obvious', 'guitarist', 'Zakk', 'Wylde', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'Black', 'Label', 'Society', 'bassist', 'Jeff', 'Pilson', 'Dokken', 'Jason', 'Bonham', 'various', 'projects', 'also', 'son', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'drummer', 'John', 'Bonham', 'made', 'experience', 'more', 'real', 'will', 'actual', 'music', 'band', 'Steel', 'Dragon', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'liked', 'Die', 'Young', 'Especially', 'Stand', 'Up', 'Blood', 'Pollution', 'Living', 'Life', 'Wasted', 'Generation', 'nice', 'overall', 'soundtrack', '80', 'rock', 'music', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'KISS', 'Motley', 'Crue', 'Def', 'Leppard', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'sing', 'act', 'course', 'brought', 'real', 'rock', 'talent', 'singers', 'Jeff', 'Scott', 'Soto', 'Bobby', 'Beers', 'Miljenko', 'Matijevic', 'Chris/Izzy', 'Cole', 'Myles', 'Kennedy', 'making', 'appearance', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'how', 'movie', 'ended', 'dawn', '1990', 'rise', 'Grunge', 'music', 'culture', 'even', 'cutting', 'hair', 'gasp', 'was', 'nice', 'wink', 'era', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'ironically', 'However', ""'re"", 'not', 'particularly', 'fond', '1980', 'Glam', 'Rock', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'too', 'exciting', 'much', 'like', 'Rockstar', 'one', 'movies', 'have', 'loved', 'watch', 'years', 'Yes', 'most', 'rock', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'there', 'heart', 'too', 'flaws', 'Rockstar', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'particularly', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Rock/Metal', 'may', 'still', 'enjoy', 'otherwise', 'not', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'Detroit', 'Rock', 'City', 'proudly', 'torch', 'Rock', ""N'Roll"", '4/5', 'stars']",N/A

Look for Jason Bonham (son of Led Zeppelin's John Bonham) as the drummer of Steel Dragon and Australian super-model Rachel Hunter (yeah, right!) as his wife.Ok, this may be just a far-fetched, rock-and-roll Cinderella story, but who cares.

It's best, as many have mentioned, to take the film for what it is, and to enjoy its many positives.Key among these positives is the skill of Mark Wahlberg, who, in this reviewer's eyes, has never let a movie down. Wahlberg plays the hard-rock naif whose ultimate fantasy comes true when he is tapped as lead singer of his favorite band, Steel Dragon. From his initial audition, where he is so frightened and awed that he is unable to sing for several minutes, to his first concert, where he falls down a dramatic staircase on stage, to his wide-eyed first encounter with a hotel room full of willing groupies, he makes us believe. And that talent allows him to rise above the predictable script and to shine.Jennifer Aniston plays his devoted manager/girlfriend, and she, too, gives a good performance within the impossible confines of her character. She is likeable and appealing as she watches her man drawn away from her into the evil world of sex, drugs and rock and roll, unable to get him back and unable to make him see what is happening to him as a man and an artist.The movie plays well, the band is pure 80s, from the sound to the hair to the wretched excess, and the music is fun. There is nothing profound or memorable in the script, but as a viewer, I have to quote Mick Jagger: ""It's only rock and roll, but I like it!""

This takes place in the mid/late 1980's where Wahlberg plays a early 20's frontman to a tribute band to ""steel dragons"", a 70's super-metal group with erie similarities to Judas Priest, although the creators deny any tie ins.  He lives at home with his parents still and is trying to ""make it big"" on someone elses music, and they do a good job. Low and behold he is handed the dream of a lifetime when Steel Dragon decides to get rid of their legendary frontman and starts a search for his replacement...which ends at Wahlbergs door.  From here we follow his character, now known as ""Izzy"" to his public through through his Dream.  No real suprises in this movie as far a story line (especially if you know the Judas priest story), and no acadamy awards for acting, but some good humor and Entertaining, with a Killer soundtrack.  Steel Dragons is made up of, and played in the movie by, real life rock stars Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne,Black Label society), Jason Bohnam (son of Jon Bohnam of Zepplin, and Bohnam), Jeff Pilson (Dokken), Jeff Scott Soto (Yngwie Malmstein group), Nick Catonese (Black label society), Mike Matijevic (steelheart).

682527,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005TPMA,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","2001's ""Rock Star"" is loosely based on the metal band Judas Priest, who hired the lead singer of an Ohio JP tribute band, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, after losing their original singer, Rob Halford, aka 'the metal god' (taken from the Priest song ""Metal Gods""), which explains why the movie was originally to be called ""The Metal God"". All the major plot points of this film parallel the Judas Priest story; only the names and times have been altered.In ""Rock Star"" the band is Steel Dragon (fictional of course), the singer of the tribute band is Chris 'Izzy' Cole (Mark Wahlberg) and the man he's replacing is Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng). Jennifer Aniston plays Izzy's girlfriend Emily and the Steel Dragon band members include Dominic West (who's excellent as always), Jason Bonham, Jeff Pilson and Zakk Wylde. Timothy Spall and Dagmara Dominczyk also have prominent roles as Steel Dragon's road manager and public relations manager respectively.The Ripper Owens story is an excellent tale for a film and this is a good movie, but the times are a bit off. In reality Rob Halford left Judas Priest in late 1991, corresponding to the advent of grunge, and Ripper Owens replaced him in early 1996; in the film the original singer leaves circa 1989 and the tribute band singer replaces him almost immediately. Ripper Owens didn't leave Judas Priest until 2003 whereas Izzy obviously leaves somewhere around late 1991/early 1992.""Rock Star"" is just an enjoyable experience, especially if you're personally familiar with the 80s/early 90s' metal scene. The soundtrack includes numerous great songs from that era, as well as the 70s (like Ted Nugent's ""Stranglehold""). Unfortunately there's not one cut by Judas Priest (!). Apparently Judas Priest were originally linked to the project but ultimately disassociated themselves due to failing to reach a financial agreement for the rights to the story; this is when the producers decided to ""re-imagine"" the tale, as they say. This is all well and good but shouldn't there be as least one Priest song in the soundtrack? Where's the justice?The film takes the middle road between advocating the rock star lifestyle and decrying it. It shows both the glories and the pitfalls. When something's no longer fun and genuine it's simply time to move on -- to thine own self be true. Such experiences naturally have both positive and negative elements. Even if the experience ends up being more bad than good it's a necessary stepping stone to who you ultimately become, that is, who you are, your true success. A good example is Blackie Lawless of W.A.S.P. (check out their 2009 album BABYLON to get my drift).[SPOILER -- Don't read this paragraph if you haven't seen the film] Some criticize the movie on the grounds that Chris (Izzy) turns to playing grunge in Seattle after leaving Steel Dragon, maintaining that he was a 'poser' all along. But didn't Rob Halford himself explore different styles of music when he left Judas Priest, in particular the band Two? In the film Chris accomplishes his dream and by the end has had his fill of the whole 'rock star' phenomenon with all its ridiculous trappings; he was older & wiser now and understandably wanted to write his OWN songs (as he wasn't allowed in Steel Dragon, neither was Ripper in real life) and opts to explore his art. Keep in mind that Ripper himself was a grunge fan and fronted a grunge tribute band called Seattle in the early 90s. When Chris leaves Steel Dragon grunge is the flavor of the month and he just goes with it; he's still young and he's exploring, that's it. I'm sure he'll go on to revisit his metal roots in the future just as Rob Halford ultimately did after his 90s' meanderings; the film just doesn't take us that far ahead. [END SPOILER]FINAL WORD: ""Rock Star"" may not be great but it's certainly an enjoyable film on the late 80s/early 90s music scene. It's equal parts dramatic, fun, funny, realistic, inspiring, educational and sobering.GRADE: BINCIDENTAL NOTE: I was the guitarist/songwriter for a metal band in the early 90s and we opened up for Tim Owens' JP tribute band in Youngstown, OH in the winter of 1995. I knew the guitarist of his band and I got to meet Tim.
