I just wish he wasn't such an awful, terrible policeman. I'm not sure if they were trying to make him some kind of ""maverick"" or something, but he makes so many gigantic mistakes it's a miracle he's not checking parking meters instead of investigating murders.I don't expect the guy to be Sherlock Holmes or anything, but just a touch of common sense and realism would be nice. Wallander bumbles from one crime scene to the next, missing clues, getting his witnesses killed and endangering everyone through his own carelessness.  As far as I can tell, Wallander solves crimes and stays alive through some form of divine intervention. That would be fine if this was a comedy, but in a ""serious drama"" I need a little less silliness and a lot more basic competence.I only made it through three episodes before I had to give up.

1243733,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B001VLBDB2,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","We got hooked on this show by watching Season 3 on TV, then circling back and watching Seasons 1 and 2 via Amazon Instant Video.  You can jump right into these shows at any point -- each is sort of a standalone procedural albeit one with the backing narrative of Detective Kurt Wallander's solitary, increasingly depressive personal life.It's a kick to watch Kenneth Branagh - one of the world's truly outstanding Shakespearean actors - transform from a hyperverbal practitioner of literature's best known soliloquies to a monosyllabic, stammering mope.  He's put on weight for the role, doesn't shave, does nothing to hide facial outbreaks on his face, wears rumpled clothing 24x7, drinks too much wine, sleeps in chairs and wakes up fully clothed with crevices on his face from the armrest.  It's quite an acting achievement.Season 1 - and the two to-date that follow - are adapted directly from Henning Mankell's novels.  [Branagh says Mankell's a fan of the productions.]  What's good is that having now got up to speed on the nine productions so far, we can double-down and take on the Swedish TV series featuring Krister Henriksson.  That work featured new material by Mankell: a screenplay he wrote to kick off the series followed by plot assistance from the author for the episodes that followed.  [There was also an earlier film series in Swedish featuring Rolf Lassgrd as the lead.  The Branagh series matches up with those.]You really can't comment on this series without noting the quirkiest aspect of the adaptation: despite being in English, the show is still based in Ystad, Sweden.  These most British of actors (other notables are Saskia Reeves, Tom Hiddleston) are solving Swedish crimes, living Swedish lives, perusing Swedish documents.  There's the hilarious little artifice of Branagh's character reading a document or sign in Swedish, so he has to read out loud in English so that we, the audience, can understand what his character is seeing.  [No subtitles here.]  It's not meant to be funny, but it brings a laugh every time the filmmakers are forced to resort to it.

1243744,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B001VLBDB2,Bobby Underwood,"[56, 57]","After The Inspecor Lynley series, this has already become my favorite installment of PBS's Masterpiece Mystery. Having heard about but not read the internationally successful mystery series from Henning Mankell, I come at this clean, so to speak, with no preconceptions of how Wallander is supposed to be, or how the mysteries unfold. While its origins may be Swedish, it very much has a British feel to the series featuring Kenneth Branagh, and a mood all its own. In short, it is quite fantastic.Like many of the better installments on PBS's Masterpiece Mystery, there is an intelligence here, and a deliberate choice of substance over flash. It makes for mystery as much about the characters as the plot. The tone is somber, and Branagh gives a subtle performance of a detective throwing himself in his work, because he's numb from events in his private life. Wallander appears to almost sleepwalk through his life when we first get acquainted with him. He feels responsible for a young girl's horrific death in the opening moments of Sidetracked, which sets the tone for the series. The image of her setting herself on fire in a field haunts him and drives him to discover why.Meanwhile, the director slowly shows Wallander's private life. He lives with his grown daughter, who basically takes care of him when he comes home because he's a mess. Emotionally frozen from events in his real life, picking up the phone at home is a big deal for him, because it is someone who knows him, rather than about work. He is an excellent detective, yet nearly paralyzed outside the lines which form that perimeter. Each installment is balanced by a riveting mystery and layers of Wallander's private life are slowly pealed away. In Firewall, for instance, his daughter Linda (Jeany Spark) attempts to get him to ""move on"" after his marriage has failed by enrolling him in an internet dating site. At the same time, the murder of a taxi driver by two young girls and ominous words about it not even mattering lead him to a plot that will create utter chaos around the globe if he can't put a stop to it. How these two stories intersect is poignant and devastating for Wallander and the viewer.Wallander's relationships with his daughter, his artistic father who may have deeper problems than he realized and many other things round out a portrait of a man who is his work because it's all he has to hang on to. Branagh is magnificent as he is rumpled in his interior rather than his exterior, and manages to convey this. The mysteries are deeply involving and intelligent, and a cast which includes Sarah Smart, Sadie Shimmin, Tom Hiddleston, and Tom Beard are well played. But there is no doubt this is Branagh's show, as this is about Wallander. The direction and look of the show fit with the character of Wallander so that he seems to fit into this world. Or is it that this is how his world is? It may not grab those looking for flash, but those who find intelligence and character development in their mysteries preferable will eat this up.

Most of it is magnificent.  There is nothing like seeing it in the original source language played by a Swedish actor.  Case in point: INSOMNIA was a Swedish mystery novel.  It was made in a Swedish version set in Sweden with Swedish actors.  It was made in an American version starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams.  I enjoyed both versions.  However, I would not have liked to see Al Pacino and Robin Williams playing Swedish detectives in Sweden.  Kenneth Branagh plays excellent British and American characters.  One could never convince me he was Swedish though.  If I hadn't spent 40 years watching foreign films in the original source language with subtitles, I guess I wouldn't even be making such a fuss over this point.  However, it is a glaring error to someone who has done so.I have no other complaint.  These are well written and directed.

Something about them is more appealing than most US television these days.Anyway, I stumbled upon the Wallander series by accident one day and watched the first episode. I was hooked.The series is based on novels written by a Swedish author which are set in Sweden. There was a Swedish video version and then a British TV version was made later. The British version, reviewed here, is done with UK actors and filmed in Sweden.I think that Wallander is darker and more violent than most British detective programs that I've seen. Graphic at times, but not overdone as in much American television. Just enough to shock a little and keep the viewer's attention riveted.""Sidetracked"" opens with a beautiful scene of a field full of yellow flowers under a bright blue sky. It's a rapeseed field to be exact - and this might be some subtle foreshadowing. There is a young woman running through the field. Wallander has been called in and tries to talk to her, but she runs from him. She stops and you see a plastic container in her hand and her pouring liquid from the container over her head. Then, she produces a lighter. Well, you just know what's about to happen, but in the beautiful field it just seems impossible. But,it happens right before your eyes and is quite disturbing. Before Wallander can stop her, she bursts into flames. Trust me, you'll want to know why. The answer is quite shocking.In ""Firewall"", a young woman murders a cad driver for no apparent reason and a man drops dead near an ATM machine. Wallander meets a woman online and starts dating her. And all these people are involved in the same sordid business. Very interesting how it all falls together, but it will keep you guessing a long time.""One Step Behind"" features a callous maniac with a gun and silencer. Very unsettling.

Lebryk,"[12, 13]","This is a series that I more or less backed into to, had never heard of the series on PBS or BBC, never read the Mankell books, had absolutely no idea what this was about. Oh, my goodness, what an incredible series. Every single detail of this series is so perfect, the acting, the cinematography, the editing, the pacing, the choice of actors, the audio...this television series puts many feature films to shame.Wallander is very hard to describe simply, or in a manner that reflects the film. On the one hand, it's a detective who done it murder mystery. On the other it's an exploration of detective Wallander, the person, where he lives, his demons, his daughter, and his ex-wife. The stories are suspenseful, intelligent, and compassionate. It's very British, but also very Swedish at the same time. But it's not either of these in some offensive way - in the high minded Masterpiece Theater or Great Performances mold. No it's a very human story told in a gracious way. Incredibly engaging.This is some of the best film production I've seen in some time. Every detail is just exactly right. Framing is so carefully considered; the use of weak and strong side of the frame is used to perfection; out of focus areas, blurry foreground, background, or center is used to direct your attention around the screen; color and placement of color on the screen... all superbly done. The choice of lens is remarkable - most scenes were filmed with fairly long lenses with very shallow depth of field - gorgeous imagery, deathly for production (missing a focus distance by small amounts is a disaster), totally strange for a television production. The pacing is just perfect, certain moments are cut away, time moves forward sometimes very fast between cuts, other times it hardly moves - but in all cases the viewer knows exactly what happened. The set design is just beautiful. It's clear this is a police station, but it looks strange. Wallander's house is different, but oddly comfortable and exactly as you'd expect it to be. The location shots are just awe inspiringly beautiful. Sound, oh so well recorded. Dead silent when the dialog is critical; full of ambient noises when location is critical to the story.Oh I could just go on and on about what is right about this film. If you haven't guessed by now, this is a film (oops, television) series so worth watching. Kenneth Branagh is remarkable, on the one hand run down and old, on the other incredibly appealing. The entire cast is perfectly selected and deliver outstanding performances.The bonus features, which I don't think have been described very well. Overall, these are not stupid redundant features where the movie is retold from some silly actor's point of view. No all these embellish the film, add to the episodes. 1) Who is Wallander - John Harvey another mystery author takes the viewer through 1 hour of Wallander's Sweden. This program alone is worth the price of admission - the travellog for Sweden is fabulous. Stocholm never looked so beautiful. The whole thing is more of where does Wallander live.2) Wallander's Look - 12 minutes mostly with Phillip Martin the director that talks about how the film had to look British but also one of the characters is Sweden. So it had to be both.3) Branagh / Mankell interview, 30 minutes. The Wallander actor talks with the author or creator of his character Henning Mankel. This is a rare event where an author really supports a film. There was a shared love for the Wallander character.4) Branagh's Wallander, 15 minutes.Overall, the bonus features are worthwhile.The series is not rated. It probably falls very much in the rating zone of Law and Order (not the spin offs, but the original series). There's some violence, you do see people shot, burned, and killed. The subject matter is somewhat adult. The big trick, these are somewhat complex stories to follow and understand. So a 13 year old might not be offended, they probably won't understand the series.

The violence, that Wallander never accepts as normal, is present to onlyserve the plot. Be warned; when the violence does happen sometimes it can be most graphic. Alot of this series revolves around Wallander and his seemingly alcoholic and subsequent depressivemood. Somehow he seems to be able to pull it together enough to solve each mystery.Set in Sweden the overall art design is cast in limpid blues and grays, which I think is Wallander'smood.  He moves across the countryside in his Volvo following his next intuition. The shows areshot in a near-35mm resolution using a 'Red One' digital camera. The cities and landscapes seempretty darn realistic and captured so well that huge amounts of artificial lighting were not used.The natural colors of the landscape hold a pall over each mystery by using  the available light. Thethree pieces are well acted, well written pieces. The main story line that keeps them together isWallander's life or lack of it, shall we say.The episodes are not depressing because Branagh's character is so well done he is able to holdthese pieces together. You will see him in his home, alone, in the middle of nowhere; barely with aneighbor in sight. Nothing symbolic about that at all. He has ragged relationships with his daughterand his father. In the first episode, 'Sidetracked', Wallander finds out his father has a dreadfuldisease. His father, played wonderfully by David Warner, paints the same landscape repeatedly.When one thinks of Wallander it appears he is painting the same landscape over and over again butfor those mysteries that arise and redeem him once again. Then he becomes emotionally involvedwith the victims instead of with his daughter, father or any other significant other that appears inhis life. It seems it is one mystery he can not solve. Wallander seems to over-empathize with hisvictims and one begins to wonder what came first, his drinking/depression or his desire to staysensitive to the victims of the crime.All of this being said these are absorbing and competent mysteries with a lot of wonderful characteractors supporting Branagh as he doggedly goes after the perpetrator of some pretty horrible crimes.Delve into these wonderful mysteries; 'Sidetracked' is about a suicide, a murder of a governmentofficial, and eventually... ; 'Firewall' is my favorite of this series. A body is found and heart attackis diagnosed. Elsewhere two teenage girls are arrested for the murder of a cab driver. Are theyconnected as Wallander suspects from the start? Watch this one and learn; 'One Step Behind' hasthree teens found dead in a secluded section of woods. Of course, a parallel plot (or is it?) has oneof Wallander's colleagues found dead. Wallander feels the killer will strike again and races to findhim/her.I gave this series 5 stars because of the acting, directing, art direction, including music, which arefirst rate. Special kudos to Branagh who has taken a seemingly depressing character and made himlive, and more importantly, made him relevant. A tough acting assignment, to say the least, for thebrilliant Kenneth Branagh in this role.One question:  Would Wallander continue to exist if crime were eradicated? It appears that is whathelps him get up in the morning and continue to live his lonely life.

1243768,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B001VLBDB2,D. S. Thurlow,"[88, 90]","The Kurt Wallander novels, authored by Henning Mankell, are quite popular in Europe but rather less well known in the US.  ""Wallander-Series I"" brings to television and DVD the dramatization of three of the novels.  Wallander, portrayed by veteran and gifted Irish actor Kenneth Branagh, is a detective on the police force of the gritty seaside town of Ystad in Sweden.  He is a borderline physical and psychological burnout case, who has lost his sense of detachment from his cases and takes everything far too personally. At the same time, he is a brillant sleuth with an ability to make intuitive connections between seemingly unrelated cases.  Assisted by his staff and supported by a faithful daughter, he manfully plugs away at some rather unorthodox cases.""Sidetracked"" opens with a brilliantly staged scene in which Wallander fails to prevent a young woman from self-immolation in a sunlit field of flowers.  He is also beset by a series of murders in the local art business, and by the health issues of his estranged father.  Only Wallander can see the connections, which lead to a deadly sex ring and a surprising killer.""Firewall"" opens with the seemingly senseless murder of a taxi driver by two young women.  As other bodies start to pile up, Wallander picks at a strange statement by one of the two young women, who escapes from police custody and then is herself horribly murdered.  Wallander's persistance leads him to an unorthodox terrorist plot, and a betrayal by a friend.""One Step Behind"" involves Wallander in the deaths of several young persons who were connected with a midsummer's eve celebration.  Additional deaths lead Wallander into a wider case in which the police seem constantly one step behind the killer or killers.This series was filmed in Sweden, which makes for some beautiful location shooting.  The sets are contrasted with some grim social rot in Swedish society, as exemplified by the gritty portrayal of Ystad society.  Wallander's crew, all British actors, provide low-key support to Branagh's haggard and unshaven lead detective.  His personal suffering over each case and over a personal life seemingly in shambles, imparts a gray tone to the stories that may be unsettling to some viewers.  However, the stories are intricately plotted and thrillingly concluded; Branagh carries the day in a fascinating portrayal.  This series is very highly recommended to fans of PBS Masterpiece Mystery looking for something different in a police procedural.",5,Something Rotten in Sweden...,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,2491,"['Kurt', 'Wallander', 'novels', 'authored', 'Henning', 'Mankell', 'are', 'quite', 'popular', 'Europe', 'rather', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'US', 'Wallander-Series', 'television', 'DVD', 'dramatization', 'three', 'novels', 'Wallander', 'portrayed', 'veteran', 'gifted', 'Irish', 'actor', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'detective', 'police', 'force', 'gritty', 'seaside', 'town', 'Ystad', 'Sweden', 'borderline', 'physical', 'psychological', 'burnout', 'case', 'who', 'lost', 'sense', 'detachment', 'cases', 'everything', 'far', 'too', 'personally', 'same', 'time', 'brillant', 'sleuth', 'ability', 'make', 'intuitive', 'connections', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'cases', 'Assisted', 'staff', 'supported', 'faithful', 'daughter', 'manfully', 'away', 'rather', 'unorthodox', 'cases', 'Sidetracked', 'brilliantly', 'staged', 'scene', 'Wallander', 'prevent', 'young', 'woman', 'self-immolation', 'sunlit', 'field', 'flowers', 'also', 'beset', 'series', 'murders', 'local', 'art', 'business', 'health', 'issues', 'estranged', 'father', 'Only', 'Wallander', 'can', 'see', 'connections', 'lead', 'deadly', 'sex', 'ring', 'surprising', 'killer', 'Firewall', 'seemingly', 'senseless', 'murder', 'taxi', 'driver', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'other', 'bodies', 'start', 'pile', 'up', 'Wallander', 'strange', 'statement', 'one', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'police', 'custody', 'then', 'horribly', 'murdered', 'Wallander', 'persistance', 'unorthodox', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'betrayal', 'friend', 'One', 'Step', 'involves', 'Wallander', 'deaths', 'several', 'young', 'persons', 'who', 'were', 'connected', 'midsummer', 'eve', 'celebration', 'Additional', 'deaths', 'lead', 'Wallander', 'wider', 'case', 'police', 'seem', 'constantly', 'one', 'step', 'killer', 'killers.This', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'Sweden', 'beautiful', 'location', 'shooting', 'sets', 'are', 'contrasted', 'grim', 'social', 'rot', 'Swedish', 'society', 'exemplified', 'gritty', 'portrayal', 'Ystad', 'society', 'Wallander', 'crew', 'British', 'actors', 'provide', 'low-key', 'support', 'Branagh', 'haggard', 'unshaven', 'lead', 'detective', 'personal', 'suffering', 'case', 'personal', 'life', 'seemingly', 'shambles', 'gray', 'tone', 'stories', 'may', 'be', 'unsettling', 'viewers', 'However', 'stories', 'are', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'thrillingly', 'concluded', 'Branagh', 'day', 'fascinating', 'portrayal', 'series', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'police', 'procedural']",N/A

Wallander is in his mid-forties and has problems in his personal life--he is divorced and has strained relations with family members, he drinks too much, and his diet is poor.  His career of solving grisly murders is challenging as well, but in spite of all of his troubles, he hasn't allowed himself to become hardened--he is intuitive and dogged in solving his cases.The BBC made the wise decision to film the series on location in Ystad.  The stories would have been excellent had they been filmed anywhere, but seeing the homes, public buildings, and great landscapes of Sweden really gives the viewer a sense of what the country is like.  Each of the three episodes is roughly the length of a made-for-TV movie, just under 90 minutes.The bonus disc has features that contain insights into the Kurt Wallander character, interviews with Mankell and Branagh, and an examination of how Swedish society has changed in recent decades.",5,Swedish Murder Mysteries,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1243,"['DVD', 'set', 'contains', 'adaptations', 'Sidetracked', 'Firewall', 'One', 'Step', 'Behind', 'three', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'novels', 'written', 'Swedish', 'author', 'Henning', 'Mankell', 'programs', 'originally', 'appeared', 'BBC', 'late', '2008.In', 'series', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'detective', 'Ystad', 'Sweden', 'Wallander', 'mid-forties', 'problems', 'personal', 'life', 'divorced', 'strained', 'relations', 'family', 'members', 'too', 'much', 'diet', 'poor', 'career', 'solving', 'grisly', 'murders', 'challenging', 'as', 'well', 'spite', 'troubles', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'become', 'hardened', 'intuitive', 'dogged', 'solving', 'cases.The', 'BBC', 'made', 'wise', 'decision', 'film', 'series', 'location', 'Ystad', 'stories', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'anywhere', 'seeing', 'homes', 'public', 'buildings', 'great', 'landscapes', 'Sweden', 'really', 'viewer', 'sense', 'what', 'country', 'three', 'episodes', 'roughly', 'length', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'just', '90', 'minutes.The', 'bonus', 'disc', 'features', 'contain', 'insights', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'character', 'interviews', 'Mankell', 'Branagh', 'examination', 'how', 'Swedish', 'society', 'changed', 'recent', 'decades']",N/A

After viewing six episodes, I'm way impressed.Here's the scoop. Kenneth Branagh plays Kurt Wallander. He's a police detective whose wife is divorcing him. His adult daughter cares dearly for him and tries to keep him form withdrawing into a shell. He's weary. In this series he, and his crew, work to solve some cases that are particularly trying.This is a well written, well acted and well produced series. The directing is handled by several people and all do a stand up job. The stories are good and the clues are meted out in a way as to keep all but the most hardened mystery fans going to the end. One of the things that really struck me was the sound design. It wavers fluidly between sounds and music and sets a great tone for everything. I like Kenneth Branagh well enough. I don't know if he's quite the genius everyone makes him to be but he's great here. His hair is unkempt. He can't seem to bring himself to shave, so stubble is ever present on his jaws. Red rimmed eyes betray his inability to get a good night's sleep. I found his acting to be outstanding. He has found the character and nails him.On the downside, I thought the others in his crew could have been written better. It took most of these episodes for them to emerge. Also, in the first three episodes the climax has him entering the lion's mouth solo. You cannot play that card too many times. Another curiosity is that these are all British actors playing Swedes in Sweden. Yet the writing uses some decidedly British expressions. The only reason I can think to not just transplant the series into England was that there were some socio-political circumstances that might be particular to Sweden. Other than that, this is well worth the time invested to watch it.",4,Branagh Wears His Years Well,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,1881,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'Swedish', 'version', 'came', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'overt', 'expectations', 'viewing', 'six', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'way', 'scoop', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'police', 'detective', 'wife', 'divorcing', 'adult', 'daughter', 'cares', 'dearly', 'tries', 'keep', 'form', 'withdrawing', 'shell', 'weary', 'series', 'crew', 'work', 'solve', 'cases', 'are', 'particularly', 'trying.This', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'produced', 'series', 'directing', 'handled', 'several', 'people', 'do', 'stand', 'up', 'job', 'stories', 'are', 'good', 'clues', 'are', 'meted', 'out', 'way', 'keep', 'most', 'hardened', 'mystery', 'fans', 'going', 'end', 'One', 'things', 'really', 'struck', 'was', 'sound', 'design', 'fluidly', 'sounds', 'music', 'great', 'tone', 'everything', 'like', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'well', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'genius', 'everyone', 'be', 'great', 'here', 'hair', 'unkempt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bring', 'shave', 'stubble', 'ever', 'present', 'jaws', 'Red', 'rimmed', 'eyes', 'betray', 'inability', 'get', 'good', 'night', 'sleep', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'outstanding', 'found', 'character', 'nails', 'him.On', 'downside', 'thought', 'others', 'crew', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'better', 'took', 'most', 'episodes', 'emerge', 'Also', 'first', 'three', 'climax', 'entering', 'lion', 'mouth', 'solo', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'card', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'curiosity', 'are', 'British', 'actors', 'playing', 'Swedes', 'Sweden', 'writing', 'decidedly', 'British', 'expressions', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'think', 'not', 'just', 'transplant', 'series', 'England', 'was', 'were', 'socio-political', 'circumstances', 'might', 'be', 'particular', 'Sweden', 'Other', 'well', 'time', 'invested', 'watch']",N/A

The first episode was good, but Firewall was filled with twists and turns, meaning the mystery was difficult to figure out.  At first I thought perhaps Wallander was going to be a tragic hero, but after watching this episode, I see that he is not.  He is not all doom, saddness, and gloom.  He just cares.  I like his character; he gets personally involved in his cases and is affected deeply by them.

They are well plotted and fabulously acted, but even the cinematography seems to have a blue cast that adds to the bleakness. Kenneth Branagh is magnificent throughout. What an actor!I've only read two Kurt Wallander mysteries, written by Henning Mankell and set in Skane, Southern Sweden. The two I've read are ""Faceless Killers"" (published 1991 in Sweden), the first in the series, and ""The Troubled Man"" (published 2009 in Sweden), the last in the series. Kurt is a police detective. He's a good detective, though he's so intense and focused that he can be hard on witnesses, his co-workers, his family, and most of all, on himself.This is the first season of the BBC TV series, which originally aired in 2008: episodes ""Sidetracked"", ""Firewall"" and ""One Step Behind"".  The 2nd season, also available on DVD, originally aired in 2010: episodes ""Faceless Killers"", ""The Man Who Smiled"" and ""The Fifth Woman"". All of the screenplays, for both sets, are based on Mankell's books by the same names.I think the TV series does an excellent job of capturing the books' Wallander. He is moderately unkempt; recently divorced but still wearing his wedding ring. He works horrific hours and has trouble sleeping at night on top of it. He sees society's underbelly on a daily basis and it has left his emotions alternately strangled and unavailable or else spewing volcanically. His relationship with his daughter is actually better in the TV series than in the books. And he is more nominally likeable in the TV series than he is in the two books I've read.There are currently plans for a 3rd TV series, and screenwriters have been commissioned. Apparently, three of the episodes will be original screenplays, not based on a Wallander book. If the series keeps going, they'll have to do so. Mankell has only written 13 Wallander novels (one, a prequel, is set pre-""Faceless Killers"").I very much enjoyed watching this series. A purist may not appreciate a Swedish series filmed in Skane, but populated 100% by English speaking characters, but it was OK with me.  Kenneth Branagh appeared at a 2009 interview in NYC, and was asked if he had considered performing Wallander with a Swedish accent. Branagh replied: ""Oh yes! But literally a moment. I sounded like the Swedish chef from the Muppets.""

The writing is decent, but not intelligent. However, I want to highlight a negative point that really annoys me. The tedious and scary social/political message in the films.It goes something like this: There is a hidden power structure in society. This hidden structure consists of men who like sexual violence against women. More powerful men are more into this type of violence. So most men are evil and if women seem to be evil it is because they have been sexually abused in the past. So they are not really evil deep down. This absurd perspective common in the early 2000s is seriously going to date these films when history is written. The writer used to be a Maoist-Communist. Maoism clearly had some sick views (i.e. millions left dead) and in some convoluted way the extremist background of the author has impacted his writing.My point is not to just label the author a Communist. Sadly, there are too many authors of his generation who used the pen to support Mao's killings of millions of innocent Chinese. I bring up to topic to explain the strange social/political message in the films. The author is giving a lot of money to charity so I am sure he is not an evil person. Still, he is totally stuck in 1960/70s values. If you live in a country mansion (and there are many in the films) you are a powerful man that oppresses women. To this the director has added that if you live in a building from the 1950/60s you are going to be a good guy. Use this heuristic and you can pick up almost all the bad guys in the films. How pathetic.I listened to an interview with the author and he claims that the central character Wallander actually develops and changes through the series. Nothing can be further from the truth. He basically remains exactly the same throughout. Have a look atSpiral - Series 1 and 2 Box Set [NON-U.S.A. FORMAT: PAL Region 2 U.K. Import] (Engrenages)for some real character development.Finally, the Wallander books have been best-sellers in northern Europe so they do speak to something going on in that part of the world. I do not know why people would take an ordinary guy with lots of personal problem to heart, but they have. So if you want to understand the popular culture of these countries you definitely should watch the films. Then please explain to me why Wallander is such a hero in the comments field below.

My boyfriend had read Henning Mankell's novels and thought Wallander was the ideal candidate.  Initially, I balked at the prospect of another crime drama, but my respect for Kenneth Branagh's talent lead me to give it a shot.  I watched the first episode and thought it might be too dark for me....but then I couldn't get it out of my mind.  I was haunted by that episode for days and I actually looked forward to the next episode.  At first it was the photography that sucked me in.  I was blown away by the landscapes and the lighting the same way I was awed by the paintings of Andrew Wyeth and Winslow Homer.  The sound track is also amazing, in my opinion.  So much attention is paid to the details.  So much depth and complexity is conveyed in the images and the sounds.  The icing on the cake is Branagh's brilliant performance as Wallander.  Again, I can't compare this series to the novels, but in general I found it refreshing to see a detective portrayed with so much emotion.  Often, the detective in a crime drama is a bitter, cynical man with a hard shell that can't be cracked.  Kurt Wallander, as played by Kenneth Branagh is about as far from that cliche as you can get.  He gets emotionally involved with every one of his cases.  He consistently exposes himself to uncomfortable, and often downright horrifying situations for the sake of the investigation, with no regard for his own personal safety.  He doesn't wait for backup, he forges ahead with dogged determination and follows his instincts.  As of this review, I have only the final episode left to watch.  So long, Wallander.

I've never seen the first series nor have I read the original novels. I find this new series very engaging and while it might not be the best show BBC has to offer I think it's one of it's strongest in years.These three 90 minute episodes star Kenneth Branagh as the empathetic but somewhat burned-out Kurt Wallander. Wallander's separated from his wife (who's found another man), he eats badly and has problems connecting with people outside his work with the exception of his likeably determined daughter. Wallander and his team work to solve cases that will seem familiar to anyone who's watched BBC america crime shows. What sets this show apart from the other mystery series' is the Wallander character himself and how he shows great empathy towards victims, their families and sometimes even the criminals. The show is also very grounded, in that despite best intentions a lot of these people don't WANT Wallander's empathy and sometimes could care less if him or his team succeed in their investigations. This gives the show a very somber tone. Also a nice touch from it's Swedish roots, all the written and typed words in the show are in the Swedish language.Bringing Kurt Wallader to life is Kenneth Branagh. ""Loner"" and ""burned-out"" are not usually words I would ascribe to Branagh but the second you see him on screen you know this someone completely different (if you ask me he'd be a great choice if they ever adapt Ken Bruen's Jack Taylor series!). The rest of the cast is great with Jeany Spark in brief but likeable appearances as Wallander's daughter, but it's Branagh that will hold your attention.While these three episodes are pretty standard BBC fare (with the last episode 'One Step Behind' a stand-out) they are very solid 'who-done-it' thrillers.

In this way I got to watch the 90 minute video over a period of 42 days.  Somewhere during the very first minutes I began to imagine that the girl setting herself on fire had been part of a sex club, and that this would turn out to be the key to the whole mystery.  What I still don't understand is, does everyone in Sweden have a gorgeous apartment or country estate?  The retired detective lived in a Georgian mansion like Brideshead, and he was only a civil servant, right?  The art dealer had a huge villa like something out of Capri, and even the very poorest person on the show (the family of Nicholas Hoult) lived on a grand scale.  This adds to the weird pleasure of Wallander; a certain disconnect, as other reviewers have noticed, the way that no one has a Swedish accent and yet they'll be sitting in front of the computer reading aloud from Swedish texts in English.The solution to Sidetracked was guessable as soon as you saw a certain young British star in what seemed like a tiny minor part.  Bad judgement all around, and not even really a good part for said star, but everyone watching the program would guess, they're not going to be star salary to get star to just show up and go away again.  They're going to pay the star to give an award winning performance as a maniac.  Same with David Warner, whom my DVD doesn't even list in the credits.  Why get him to play Branagh's father, unless it is to make Branagh seem like a restrained actor in comparison.Didn't you love those paintings?  ""I always get up in the morning and think, this is the say I'm going to paint something thats not a tree, and then, when night comes, I look and I've painted the same tree.""  I wonder if he's that corny in the books.Nevertheless I plodded on with part 2, Firewall, and again it was like, a horrible violent crime occurs right up front, and it depresses Wallander!  (Same with #3, One Step Behind, but by then I was hooked you see!)  I can't do without that slate colored sky nor those paintings of trees.  And that one detective on the squad with the curly dark hair who looks like my idol the novelist Lynne Tillman!  I need more, more, more...  Someone told me there's a new series of Wallander coming up in England and that eventually we'll see it over here.  Hooray, it may be a grim show, but Kenneth Branagh can cry real tears at the drop of a suspect.  he's outstanding, even when trying to jog like a rhino.  I suggest that the producers try to get some stunt casting, former co-stars or wives of Ken like Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Helena Bonham Carter.  That would pep things up again in round two.

Inspector Kurt Wallander, a scruffy middle-aged police detective in the seaside town of Ystad, Sweden, is frustrated by family pressures while he obsessively pursues the solution to his cases. Kenneth Branagh plays the unselfconscious Wallander with perhaps a little more ruggedness than earlier Swedish adaptations. But he is still a serious, introverted man who can hardly be distracted from his job. The series was filmed on location in Ystad, by coincidence at the same time a new Swedish adaptation was being filmed. The flatness and bigness of the countryside accentuate Wallander's introversion and place the action against a sweeping tableau.""Sidetracked"" begins as a young woman burns herself to death in front of Wallander. He barely has time to ponder that tragedy when former Minister of Justice, now political pundit, Gustave Wetterstedt is found murdered near his home, his skull split with an axe and scalped. Then a wealthy art dealer of dubious reputation, Arnie Carmen, suffers the same fate. A drunken journalist who had attempted to do an expos&eacute; on Wetterstedt suggests a connection between the men: a prostitution ring years ago that was covered up by a corrupt police officer. But Wallander can't move fast enough to prevent more murders. This episode is an effective introduction to Wallander and his family, but the murders are self-consciously bizarre and barely credible. The commentary on Swedish politics is interesting but touched upon only briefly. 3 stars.""Firewall"" finds a taxi driver stabbed to death by a young woman, Sonja Hokberg, who seems uninterested in the consequences, claiming ""none of this matters"". Just as suspicions about her motive nag Wallander, a series of odd technical glitches allow Sonja to escape custody and a body to disappear from the morgue. It begins to look like Sonja's escape is somehow connected to a computer programmer named Tynnes Falk who dropped dead after using an ATM in the town square. More bodies turn up, as Wallander and his detectives race to figure out what Falk was up to with the aid of hacker Robert Modin. The connections between events and the motives of the villains don't strain credibility as much as the first episode. ""Firewall"" builds suspense and alludes to the possibility of economic terrorism, an intriguing subject.  4 stars.""One Step Behind"" opens with the murders of 3 young picnickers on Midsummer's  Eve. One of their mothers tries to convince the police that her daughter is really missing, not gallivanting around Europe on holiday. No one is quite convinced until fellow police detective Svedberg (Tom Beard) is found murdered in his apartment, photographs of the missing teenagers and of a mysterious woman named ""Louise"" concealed in a location that Wallander will find them. Svedberg's life is a mystery as much as his death. What did he know about the 3 missing people? Why was he interviewing their parents and friends in the weeks before his death? The killer's motives in this case seem entirely implausible and Svedberg's actions are not adequately explained. But its strength is the genuine puzzle that it builds around Svedberg. 4 stars.",4,"Kenneth Branagh as Henning Mankell's Scruffy, Single-Minded Swedish Detective.",1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,3282,"['Wallander', 'Series', '1', 'adapts', 'three', 'Henning', 'Mankell', 'internationally', 'popular', 'detective', 'novels', 'English-language', 'films', 'Inspector', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'scruffy', 'middle-aged', 'police', 'detective', 'seaside', 'town', 'Ystad', 'Sweden', 'frustrated', 'family', 'pressures', 'obsessively', 'solution', 'cases', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'unselfconscious', 'Wallander', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'ruggedness', 'earlier', 'Swedish', 'adaptations', 'still', 'serious', 'introverted', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'distracted', 'job', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Ystad', 'coincidence', 'same', 'time', 'new', 'Swedish', 'adaptation', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'flatness', 'bigness', 'countryside', 'accentuate', 'Wallander', 'introversion', 'place', 'action', 'sweeping', 'tableau', 'Sidetracked', 'young', 'woman', 'death', 'front', 'Wallander', 'barely', 'time', 'ponder', 'tragedy', 'when', 'former', 'Minister', 'Justice', 'now', 'political', 'pundit', 'Gustave', 'Wetterstedt', 'found', 'murdered', 'home', 'skull', 'split', 'axe', 'scalped', 'Then', 'wealthy', 'art', 'dealer', 'dubious', 'reputation', 'Arnie', 'Carmen', 'same', 'fate', 'drunken', 'journalist', 'who', 'had', 'attempted', 'do', 'expos', 'eacute', 'Wetterstedt', 'connection', 'men', 'prostitution', 'ring', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'covered', 'up', 'corrupt', 'police', 'officer', 'Wallander', 'ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'fast', 'enough', 'prevent', 'more', 'murders', 'episode', 'effective', 'introduction', 'Wallander', 'family', 'murders', 'are', 'self-consciously', 'bizarre', 'barely', 'credible', 'commentary', 'Swedish', 'politics', 'interesting', 'touched', 'only', 'briefly', '3', 'stars', 'Firewall', 'taxi', 'driver', 'stabbed', 'death', 'young', 'woman', 'Sonja', 'Hokberg', 'who', 'uninterested', 'consequences', 'claiming', 'none', 'matters', 'Just', 'suspicions', 'motive', 'nag', 'Wallander', 'series', 'odd', 'technical', 'glitches', 'allow', 'Sonja', 'escape', 'custody', 'body', 'disappear', 'morgue', 'look', 'Sonja', 'escape', 'somehow', 'connected', 'computer', 'programmer', 'named', 'Tynnes', 'Falk', 'who', 'dropped', 'dead', 'using', 'ATM', 'town', 'square', 'More', 'bodies', 'turn', 'up', 'Wallander', 'detectives', 'race', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Falk', 'was', 'up', 'aid', 'hacker', 'Robert', 'Modin', 'connections', 'events', 'motives', 'villains', 'do', ""n't"", 'strain', 'credibility', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'episode', 'Firewall', 'suspense', 'alludes', 'possibility', 'economic', 'terrorism', 'intriguing', 'subject', '4', 'stars', 'One', 'Step', 'murders', '3', 'young', 'picnickers', 'Midsummer', 'Eve', 'One', 'mothers', 'tries', 'convince', 'police', 'daughter', 'really', 'missing', 'not', 'gallivanting', 'Europe', 'holiday', 'one', 'quite', 'convinced', 'fellow', 'police', 'detective', 'Svedberg', 'Tom', 'Beard', 'found', 'murdered', 'apartment', 'photographs', 'missing', 'teenagers', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'named', 'Louise', 'concealed', 'location', 'Wallander', 'will', 'find', 'Svedberg', 'life', 'mystery', 'as', 'much', 'death', 'What', 'did', 'know', '3', 'missing', 'people', 'Why', 'was', 'interviewing', 'parents', 'friends', 'weeks', 'death', 'killer', 'motives', 'case', 'seem', 'entirely', 'implausible', 'Svedberg', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'adequately', 'explained', 'strength', 'genuine', 'puzzle', 'Svedberg', '4', 'stars']",N/A

I was enthralled for all three episodes of series one.This series stars Kenneth Branagh as Kurt Wallander a Swedish detective inspector who is still reeling from being separated from his wife and his distant relationship with his adult daughter.This series quickly won me over with the distinctive ring-tone from Wallandar's phone and the beautiful scenery of the Swedish country.Series one also stars, Sarah Smart as Anne-Britt Hoglund, Tom Hiddleston as Magnus Martinsson, Richard McCabe as Nyberg, Tom Beard as Svedberg, Sadie Shimmin as Lisa Holgersson, Jeany Spark as Linda Wallander (Kurt's daughter), and David Warner as Povel Wallander (Kurt's father).Filmed in 2008 series one consists of the following episodes:""Sidetracked"" is the introduction to the character of Kurt Wallandar.  Wallandar witnesses a horrific suicide of a young woman which is some how connected to the brutual slayings of a government ministry and a rich Swedish magnate in the art scene. When you along with Wallandar find out how everything connects you will be shocked. (5 stars for this episode)""Firewall"" has Wallandar investigating a brutal slaying of a taxi driver by two young women. This death along with the subsequent escape from one of the defendants ties into a random heart attack victim found near an ATM.  Wallendar also tries to start to move on in his personal life (5 stars for this episode)""One Step Behind"" has Wallandar investigating the murder of one of his colleagues and how it ties into three teenagers that have gone missing.

A British and Scandinavian cast speak British English and use British expressions and colloquialisms.  At the same time, the stories are shot in Sweden and the Swedish landscape is a key element of the storytelling.  Wallander himself is suitably Swedish (Mankell is married to Ingmar Bergman's daughter, it should be remembered) and he is played, many say, in an 'existentialist' manner.  Wallander is like R. D. Wingfield's character, Jack Frost, in that his job is all-consuming, his personal life is generally in tatters and his persistence is legendary.  Frost, however, is, by turns, a comic figure, who jokes with his colleagues and his criminal adversaries and interrupts his investigations to ingest hearty portions of Indian food.  Wallander is deadly serious, his life deadly serious, his investigations deadly serious. Branagh plays him with mussed hair, razor stubble, flecks of detritus on his jackets and with moods just this side of despairing.  The stories themselves, however, are not despairing.  The plots are tight and more or less plausible.  The acting is first-rate, with a strong supporting cast and the production values are absolutely top-notch.

Although the story lines are quite similar to what one would expect from detective fiction, the subject matter is treated with far more depth of feeling. Story lines that might be predictable or corny in other shows feel more believable here. To the extent that the plots are as equally absurd as those in other cop shows, they serve as more of a backdrop, so that the real subject of the show is this main character guy who is just a wreck. Every episode is atmospheric, slow-paced, and heavy with brooding. The cinematography is fantastic.Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Wallander is a pleasure to watch because his performances are so nuanced, conveying a full range of emotion - you can see what the main character is thinking as events unfold. Wallander's life sucks. His father has Alzheimer's, his wife dumped him, his daughter resents him for never being available. He is drunk, obsessive, guilt-ridden, and anxious - some other reviewers have said ""overwrought,"" but I feel this is what makes him an interesting character - the point of the series being not so much solving the standard crime-show mysteries, but riding along with Wallander through all of his tribulations and inner turmoil. Unlike in the typical cop shows, wherein the characters shrug off murders and wise-crack over the corpses they find, he is deeply affected by horrors he witnesses at his job, and seems perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown.I tend to like dramas that are gritty, arty, grim, bleak, depressing, moody, or in some other way emotionally true (if not factually believable, necessarily). I loved the show ""The Wire,"" and I think this is of similar quality. I also liked ""Band of Brothers,"" and ""The Pacific,"" ""Mad Men,"" and the first season of ""Six Feet Under,"" all of which I mention so that you will have some idea of what appeals to me, and hence whether your taste is similar.

And what is it about Sweden that seems to turn out twisted, psychotic criminals who murder in gruesome ways.I gave this the title I did because Sir Kenneth has only a couple of ways in which he can illustrate confusion through his acting.  I'd love to see him beef up his emotional palette a bit.  But overall, this is a fabulous series, gripping and bleak, with Tom Hiddleston (for all you 'Loki' fans) in a major recurring role.  Definitely not for young viewers due to the graphic nature of some of the murders, these mysteries deliver some great twists and a compelling story arc.Although not the fault of the actors, one plot theme that kept coming up that bothered this audience (more than me) was that of Wallander's daughter:  yes, we got that she was an angry young thing the first time out and yes, she thought he should have acted a particular way towards her mother when it reached a certain point after their separation.  But she was very full of herself and needed telling off a time or two, and to stop trying to order everything to be the way she wanted it.

1243869,A3FMZ98X1GIYV9,B001VLBDB2,S. McGee,"[6, 7]","That's the advice troubled Swedish detective Kurt Wallander gets from a former cop, one who has mastered the art of ignoring the uncomfortable gritty reality that surrounds them in today's Sweden. Wallander, a closet idealist, can't grasp that concept, choosing instead to fight for some kind of justice.This television series reminded me (in case I needed reminding) just why Branagh became a nearly-overnight stage, cinema and television star in his early 20s, even before he was nominated for an Oscar for starring in, directing and co-producing what has now become for me the definitive edition of Henry V. (Henry V) Two decades later, Branagh takes on an iconic role of a very different kind. Hordes of mystery addicts have discovered Henning Mankell's police detective hero, Kurt Wallander, in recent years, and now Branagh has brought him to life for Mankell's legion of English-language readers.Branagh doesn't play the role; he inhabits it. (I completely forgot that he was an actor; he WAS Wallander, in the kind of performance that theater- and movie-goers always hope to find, but so rarely do.) His Wallander is battered and bruised by life, struggling from day to day but never really ends up jaded or cynical; he clings his idea of justice, refusing a ham-handed suggestion that he close his eyes to evil-doing, and reacting with outrage to the things that human beings can do to each other. He may be a voice crying in the wilderness, but that isn't going to stop Branagh/Wallander from trying to act. You can see each blow as he receives it (Branagh is actually the only male actor I've seen cry convincingly on screen), whether from the discoveries he makes about his cases and the new Sweden they reveal (a child of 5 who tries to put out his own eyes with scissors??) or those about himself and his relationship with his wife (who never appears in person; they're separated), daughter Linda or his aging father.The plots appear downright bizarre at first -- a trio of young people dressed in 18th century clothing, slaughtered as they celebrate Midsummer's Day; a young woman who suddenly attacks a taxi-driver with a knife and confesses, saying ""it doesn't matter; and a teenage girl who sets fire to herself in a field of rapeseed after Wallander, summoned by a concerned farmer, tries to reassure her by identifying himself as a cop. But the bizarre surface quickly reveals a more familiar kind of criminal behavior and plot lying just beneath the surface.There's a lot of suspense, but for me the main reason to watch these was the stunningly good acting and the almost hypnotic cinematography. This is head and shoulders above other recent police procedural imports from the BBC, IMO; so good that even after watching the DVDs as rentals, I'm buying them to add to my collection. (They are now available to US viewers; you don't need a multi-region DVD player any longer. The only series of comparable quality is the one made up of the P.D. James mysteries featuring Roy Marsden as Adam Dalgliesh, although those never had the lofty cinematography and production values that this series does. I only hope that the producers take a leaf from the Dalgliesh/PD James series and proceed to film many new episodes.There's a great bonus feature; a long documentary-style 'behind the scenes' glimpse into Mankell's actual world and Wallander's fictional one that manages to avoid being fawning and gives the viewer (and any Mankell fans out there) some real and significant background to help them understand the evolution of Sweden from an insular and homogeneous society into one of Europe's most multicultural, with all the social ills that has brought with it.If you enjoy this and have read Mankell's books, the next logical place to go are the equally gritty (albeit less procedural) books by Stieg Larsson,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)andThe Girl Who Played with Fire.",5,"""If you want to make a difference, join the fire brigade""",1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,3905,"['advice', 'troubled', 'Swedish', 'detective', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'former', 'cop', 'one', 'who', 'mastered', 'art', 'ignoring', 'uncomfortable', 'gritty', 'reality', 'today', 'Sweden', 'Wallander', 'closet', 'idealist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'concept', 'choosing', 'instead', 'fight', 'kind', 'justice.This', 'television', 'series', 'reminded', 'case', 'needed', 'reminding', 'just', 'why', 'Branagh', 'became', 'nearly-overnight', 'stage', 'cinema', 'television', 'star', 'early', '20s', 'even', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'starring', 'directing', 'co-producing', 'what', 'now', 'become', 'definitive', 'edition', 'Henry', 'V.', 'Henry', 'V', 'Two', 'decades', 'later', 'Branagh', 'iconic', 'role', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'Hordes', 'mystery', 'addicts', 'have', 'discovered', 'Henning', 'Mankell', 'police', 'detective', 'hero', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'recent', 'years', 'now', 'Branagh', 'brought', 'life', 'Mankell', 'legion', 'English-language', 'readers.Branagh', ""n't"", 'play', 'role', 'completely', 'forgot', 'was', 'actor', 'WAS', 'Wallander', 'kind', 'performance', 'theater-', 'movie-goers', 'always', 'hope', 'find', 'so', 'rarely', 'do', 'Wallander', 'battered', 'bruised', 'life', 'struggling', 'day', 'day', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'jaded', 'cynical', 'idea', 'justice', 'refusing', 'ham-handed', 'suggestion', 'close', 'eyes', 'evil-doing', 'reacting', 'outrage', 'things', 'human', 'beings', 'can', 'do', 'other', 'may', 'be', 'voice', 'crying', 'wilderness', ""n't"", 'going', 'stop', 'Branagh/Wallander', 'trying', 'act', 'can', 'see', 'blow', 'Branagh', 'actually', 'only', 'male', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'cry', 'convincingly', 'screen', 'discoveries', 'cases', 'new', 'Sweden', 'reveal', 'child', '5', 'who', 'put', 'out', 'own', 'eyes', 'scissors', 'relationship', 'wife', 'who', 'never', 'person', ""'re"", 'separated', 'daughter', 'Linda', 'aging', 'father.The', 'plots', 'appear', 'downright', 'bizarre', 'first', 'trio', 'young', 'people', 'dressed', '18th', 'century', 'clothing', 'slaughtered', 'celebrate', 'Midsummer', 'Day', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'suddenly', 'taxi-driver', 'knife', 'confesses', 'saying', ""n't"", 'matter', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'fire', 'herself', 'field', 'rapeseed', 'Wallander', 'summoned', 'concerned', 'farmer', 'tries', 'reassure', 'identifying', 'cop', 'bizarre', 'surface', 'quickly', 'more', 'familiar', 'kind', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'plot', 'lying', 'just', 'surface.There', 'lot', 'suspense', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'was', 'stunningly', 'good', 'acting', 'almost', 'hypnotic', 'cinematography', 'head', 'shoulders', 'other', 'recent', 'police', 'procedural', 'imports', 'BBC', 'IMO', 'so', 'good', 'even', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'rentals', ""'m"", 'buying', 'add', 'collection', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'US', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'longer', 'only', 'series', 'comparable', 'quality', 'one', 'made', 'P.D', 'James', 'mysteries', 'featuring', 'Roy', 'Marsden', 'Adam', 'Dalgliesh', 'never', 'had', 'lofty', 'cinematography', 'production', 'values', 'series', 'only', 'hope', 'producers', 'take', 'leaf', 'Dalgliesh/PD', 'James', 'series', 'proceed', 'film', 'many', 'new', 'great', 'bonus', 'feature', 'long', 'documentary-style', 'scenes', 'glimpse', 'Mankell', 'actual', 'world', 'Wallander', 'fictional', 'one', 'avoid', 'being', 'fawning', 'viewer', 'Mankell', 'fans', 'there', 'real', 'significant', 'background', 'help', 'understand', 'evolution', 'Sweden', 'insular', 'homogeneous', 'society', 'one', 'Europe', 'most', 'multicultural', 'social', 'ills', 'brought', 'it.If', 'enjoy', 'have', 'read', 'Mankell', 'books', 'next', 'logical', 'place', 'go', 'are', 'equally', 'gritty', 'less', 'procedural', 'books', 'Stieg', 'Larsson', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Vintage', 'andThe', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Played', 'Fire']",N/A

1243872,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001VLBDB2,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 5]","""Wallander,"" is a 2008 British Broadcasting Corporation production that is set in Sweden.  The DVD boxed set is being released here in conjunction with the series' showing on ""Masterpiece Mystery Theatre,"" on Public Broadcasting System stations.  The TV series, a British mystery/crime drama/thriller is based on the Wallander novels of Henning Mankel, Sweden's most popular author, nationally and internationally: it follows on the heels of two successful Swedish TV serials of the same material.  The material released here comprises the same three episodes we saw on TV.Heavyweight British actor Kenneth Branagh (the Harry Potter movies,lots of Shakespeare,Dead Again,The Gingerbread Man), plays Kurt Wallander, Swedish cop.  I was rather surprised to find such an actor playing a cop: perhaps he also produced this?  At any rate, he turns in a good, intense performance, as a miserably lonely and unhappy human being and cop.  He's well-supported by the rest of the cast.  The veteran David Warner (Planet of the Apes (Special Edition);Tom Jones (1963)) plays his father, but only appears on one episode; Jeany Spark plays the detective's daughter Linda.  The detective is ably supported at the station, by Sarah Smart as Anne-Britt Hoglund; Tom Beard as Svedberg; and Tom Hiddleston as Martinsson.  It is rather odd that this production has been cast with English actors: they do a good job, but still, most of us will think, I believe, that there should have been more Swedish, or at least Scandinavian, actors cast.  And we are left wondering whether all these people can speak Swenglish, as all the road signs, etc., are in Swedish, while the people in front of them are speaking English.  And, while I'm on this subject, subtitles would have been helpful-- this is a new production. after all - as Branagh swallows his dialog.The serial, as the novels on which it is based, is set in Ystad, Skane Ian, Sweden, a beautiful, sparsely settled, rather rural and isolated part of the country, apparently.  Many of the exteriors appear to have been filmed there, and they're lovely, and interesting to look at.  Some of the interiors also look Swedish, but, of course, they might have been filmed on English sound stages.The episodes are:Season 1, Episode 1.  Sidetracked.  Wallander sees a young woman immolate herself; then a government minister is murdered and scalped.Season 1, Episode 2.  Firewall.  Eighteen year old Sonia admits to the vicious killing of a taxi driver, but tells Wallander ""it doesn't matter any more.""Season 1, Episode 3.  One Step Behind.  A party of teenagers are murdered as they picnic in the woods, wearing fancy dress.  And Wallander eventually finds out a lot more about Svedberg than he wanted to know.The TV series ""Wallander"" bears many resemblances to the late, lamented British mystery TV seriesInspector Morse - Complete Collection; which was based on the novels of Colin Dexter. So, I understand, do the novels on which ""Wallander"" is based, down to the detective's playing Mozart in his car, resemble Dexter's work.  Grumpy detective drives around in car, solves cases.  I found the cases to be rather complex, and interesting, though I must agree with other reviewers who found them a bit unlikely, and unwieldy.  At any rate, I understand there's another series to come: subtitles, please, and maybe a few Scandinavian actors?",4,"Grumpy Detective Drives Around in Car, Solves Cases",1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,3371,"['Wallander', '2008', 'British', 'Broadcasting', 'Corporation', 'production', 'set', 'Sweden', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'being', 'released', 'here', 'conjunction', 'series', 'showing', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'Theatre', 'Public', 'Broadcasting', 'System', 'stations', 'TV', 'series', 'British', 'mystery/crime', 'drama/thriller', 'based', 'Wallander', 'novels', 'Henning', 'Mankel', 'Sweden', 'most', 'popular', 'author', 'nationally', 'internationally', 'heels', 'two', 'successful', 'Swedish', 'TV', 'serials', 'same', 'material', 'material', 'released', 'here', 'same', 'three', 'saw', 'TV.Heavyweight', 'British', 'actor', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'lots', 'Shakespeare', 'Dead', 'Again', 'Gingerbread', 'Man', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'Swedish', 'cop', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'find', 'such', 'actor', 'playing', 'cop', 'perhaps', 'also', 'produced', 'rate', 'good', 'intense', 'performance', 'miserably', 'lonely', 'unhappy', 'human', 'being', 'cop', 'well-supported', 'rest', 'cast', 'veteran', 'David', 'Warner', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Tom', 'Jones', '1963', 'father', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'Jeany', 'Spark', 'detective', 'daughter', 'Linda', 'detective', 'ably', 'supported', 'station', 'Sarah', 'Smart', 'Anne-Britt', 'Hoglund', 'Tom', 'Beard', 'Svedberg', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Martinsson', 'rather', 'odd', 'production', 'been', 'cast', 'English', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'still', 'most', 'will', 'think', 'believe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'Swedish', 'least', 'Scandinavian', 'actors', 'cast', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'people', 'can', 'speak', 'Swenglish', 'road', 'signs', 'etc.', 'are', 'Swedish', 'people', 'front', 'are', 'speaking', 'English', ""'m"", 'subject', 'subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'new', 'production', 'Branagh', 'dialog.The', 'serial', 'novels', 'based', 'set', 'Ystad', 'Skane', 'Ian', 'Sweden', 'beautiful', 'sparsely', 'settled', 'rather', 'rural', 'isolated', 'part', 'country', 'apparently', 'Many', 'exteriors', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'there', ""'re"", 'lovely', 'interesting', 'look', 'interiors', 'also', 'look', 'Swedish', 'course', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'English', 'sound', 'stages.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'Season', '1', 'Episode', '1', 'Sidetracked', 'Wallander', 'young', 'woman', 'immolate', 'then', 'government', 'minister', 'murdered', 'scalped.Season', '1', 'Episode', '2', 'Firewall', 'Eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'Sonia', 'vicious', 'killing', 'taxi', 'driver', 'Wallander', ""n't"", 'matter', 'more', 'Season', '1', 'Episode', '3', 'One', 'Step', 'Behind', 'A', 'party', 'teenagers', 'are', 'murdered', 'picnic', 'woods', 'wearing', 'fancy', 'dress', 'Wallander', 'eventually', 'out', 'lot', 'more', 'Svedberg', 'wanted', 'know.The', 'TV', 'series', 'Wallander', 'many', 'resemblances', 'late', 'lamented', 'British', 'mystery', 'TV', 'seriesInspector', 'Morse', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'was', 'based', 'novels', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'So', 'understand', 'do', 'novels', 'Wallander', 'based', 'down', 'detective', 'playing', 'Mozart', 'car', 'resemble', 'Dexter', 'work', 'Grumpy', 'detective', 'drives', 'car', 'cases', 'found', 'cases', 'be', 'rather', 'complex', 'interesting', 'must', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'found', 'bit', 'unlikely', 'unwieldy', 'rate', 'understand', 'series', 'come', 'subtitles', 'please', 'maybe', 'few', 'Scandinavian', 'actors']",N/A

Initially, I was a little sceptical about an English classic Shakespearean actor playing a Swedish detective. Kenneth Branagh the protagonist plays an authentic detective facing the downs of life including a divorce and a father heading towards dementia. His daughter supports him as best possible. The series is shot in Sweden and provides great backdrops of the Swedish coastline and country locations. The English dialogue in no way detracts from the stories with Kenneth Branagh playing a detective at odds with himself and resolves his inner torment through crime fighting. Great scenery, depth of character and non-Hollywood plots make this into a viewing imperative for detective fans everywhere.

1243881,A2U83LBDG66QKS,B001VLBDB2,Tre.fire,"[3, 4]","First of all, the producers/writers seem like they've watched a couple of Bergman films (I'm thinking ""Seventh Seal"" and maybe ""Wild Strawberries"" with the addition of ""Scenes from a Marriage"" to inform the relationships) and seem to think that explains ever Swede. They have also not hired a consultant or even asked a Swedish speaker how to pronounce any of the names, place or human and are guessing based on what it might sound like if pronounced in English (Kalle = Cali, for instance, instead of Kah-la, to write it phonetically, Bornoy = Bornoh instead of bern-uh...it means ""baby island"", unless they changed the spelling...), a mild annoyance for speakers of the language.That aside, something that has really caught fire the last decade in film is a straightforward story that is actually totally irrational and simplistic. With all these shows, the perp, the meanderings of the story-line, everything is entirely predictable, yet the endings are entirely unrealistic and facile. Take the third episode in this series. The final scene, after they've already projected the ending and everything else in the story from the get-go, is with the killer pointing a gun down at the head of Wallander's daughter who is on her knees. W has his gun drawn and pointed at the killer but can't shoot because the guy will kill the girl. Tearful scene, that ends with a clear declaration that the killer is about to shoot, so W tries to shoot first but his gun jams. Fortunately, Martinson, his second in command, has followed him there and into the house, arrives just at the climax of the scene, takes it all in and shouts, Kurt get down. Kurt drops to the floor and Martinson shoots and kills the killer...but what about the gun in the girl's head? I guess it wasn't a problem after all. That is just such a shortcut ending, it's as if they waved their hand in front of the screen and said, ""Hi presto!"" and it was all good. I just don't understand how producers, directors and writers get away with that garbage these days. Are people really so easy to please after all these years of TV that story, surprise, continuity, and originality are no longer needed to please people?I give the series 2.5 stars, mostly for the scenes of rural Sweden, the beauty of the landscape, the architecture. I've been away from the country for a long time and the shots have meaning or me. The dialogue, story-lines, writing and acting, are in my opinion sub-standard (at least by my standards...), but Sweden is beautiful. I recommend the Swedish version of this show, though that suffers from other failures in itself.

The production values are high and the cast(including Kenny) are fine actors. The problem is watching Ken Branagh be a great artist is just so painful.The Wallander character is a tragic burnt out wreck with all kind of issues dealing with his daughter, ex-wife, father and the bottle. The problem with this tv series vs the books is that too much screen time is spent beating you over the head with Wallander's suffering. The storylines and the mystery itself are secondary to almost endless footage of Wallander suffering and being confused. There is almost no time spent on the actual detecting of the crime or the other characters situation in life.

Wallander feeds my need to crawl inside the male brain and watch a man driven by inward demons perform his difficult job of catching killers.It is a BBC series about a Swedish detective. (I have read there is to be a season four in 2014, but I'm having difficulty finding if it's been released or filmed.)  The stories are violent, sometimes sick, as the intense detective searches for the answer.  However, it's not always the search for the killer that is intriguing about this series. It's more the character of Kurt Wallander, as he goes through life trying to find meaning in everything around him.From a broken marriage, a dysfunctional relationship with his daughter, and a strained relationship with his father, it's a good challenge for a psychologist.  As for my personal tastes, it holds the keys to great drama - an interesting storyline to keep you guessing and a subplot of the main character's life as it intertwines into his daily routine.Putting aside the annoying ring tone on his telephone, it never seems to end getting him up at all hours of the night fetching him to the latest gruesome murder.  Set in Sweden with beautiful landscape, the stories are adaptations of novels by a Swedish author, Henning Mankell's,  An impressive list of books are available on Amazon.Frankly, I'm not too keen on violent murders. Be forewarned quite a few of these are not a pretty sight. Nevertheless, I found the series deeply intriguing because of the character. There is something about him that makes you empathize with his pain.  You see it, but he never articulates it.  His relationships are estranged, and sadly he realizes he is the way he is because of his vocation.  Not many crime series move me to tears, except one in particular in Season 2, &#34;The Fifth Woman.&#34;  The ending was a powerful climax to catching a serial killer and a breaking point for Wallander that was unprecedented.Kenneth Branagh's performance in this series is top notch.  With a long line of awards and other nominations for best actor, it's quite obvious he makes this series the time worth watching. If you are looking for a great and intense crime series, you should microwave the popcorn and check this one out.
