675367,A2HUU0YW6HNNQE,B00005QJIA,"A.F. ""musicfan585""","[15, 16]","Being a huge Iron Maiden fan, I decided that since I didn't have enough money to purchase the ROCK IN RIO DVD, I would go ahead and buy the cheaper Maiden DVD which was a 50-minute documentary on the making of their all-time classic third album THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST.  It was part of a music series called ""Classic Albums"" and I thought it would be cool to see how this heavy metal milestone came into place back in the early '80s.  This is a very insightful DVD, filled with great interviews, never-before-seen concert footage, some cool bonus material, and a rich, detailed history to boot.  I look at NUMBER OF THE BEAST now in a new light than ever before.The program traces Maiden's beginnings in the late '70s up to their breakout success with BEAST in 1982.  We see early concert footage in the clubs with original lead singer Paul Di'anno, decked out in leather-clad gear; how Maiden became one of the ""leaders"" of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (and how they detested it); Paul's exit from the band and Bruce's arrival after leaving his own band Samson; incredible commentary on the writing and recording process of the album; and the lasting impact the album has had.As much as I loved the insight and detail, what really impressed me about the interviews was the humor.  For example, during the segment for ""The Prisoner,"" it cuts to the set of the ""village"" where the original Prisoner TV show was filmed, and there you see Bruce decked out in the same outfit Patrick McGoohan wore on the show.  Other funny bits occur when the band and their manager Rod Smallwood discuss the backlash NUMBER OF THE BEAST received in America.  Bruce says that one guy went so far as to carry a huge 25-foot cross (the same cross Jesus carried, you see) as a means of protest in front of the venue.  Smallwood then talks about how people started burning copies of the album, and then decided to smash them instead with hammers because ""the fumes of the Devil's music"" would poison the atmosphere.  Hilarious stuff.The bonus materials are also very good.  We see extra, equally detailed interviews that were cut out of the final program; two shots of Adrian Smith playing the riffs for ""Children of the Damned"" and ""The Number of the Beast""; a poignant message from Clive Burr thanking the fans for their support with his struggle with MS; and the performance of ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"" from the Rock in Rio concert (that was the best).Overall, this is a well-made, interesting, and humorous short little portrait into the world of Iron Maiden.  This is a dedication to one of heavy metal's finest.",5,A Great Insight into a Great Album,1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,2598,"['Being', 'huge', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'fan', 'decided', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'purchase', 'ROCK', 'IN', 'RIO', 'DVD', 'would', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'cheaper', 'Maiden', 'DVD', 'was', '50-minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'all-time', 'classic', 'third', 'THE', 'NUMBER', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'was', 'part', 'music', 'series', 'called', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'see', 'how', 'heavy', 'metal', 'milestone', 'came', 'place', 'back', 'early', 'very', 'insightful', 'DVD', 'filled', 'great', 'interviews', 'never-before-seen', 'concert', 'footage', 'cool', 'bonus', 'material', 'rich', 'detailed', 'history', 'boot', 'look', 'NUMBER', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'now', 'new', 'light', 'ever', 'before.The', 'program', 'traces', 'Maiden', 'beginnings', 'late', ""'70s"", 'up', 'breakout', 'success', 'BEAST', '1982', 'see', 'early', 'concert', 'footage', 'clubs', 'original', 'lead', 'singer', 'Paul', ""Di'anno"", 'decked', 'out', 'leather-clad', 'gear', 'how', 'Maiden', 'became', 'one', 'leaders', 'New', 'Wave', 'British', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'how', 'detested', 'Paul', 'exit', 'band', 'Bruce', 'arrival', 'leaving', 'own', 'band', 'Samson', 'incredible', 'commentary', 'writing', 'recording', 'process', 'album', 'lasting', 'impact', 'album', 'had.As', 'much', 'loved', 'insight', 'detail', 'what', 'really', 'impressed', 'interviews', 'was', 'humor', 'example', 'segment', 'Prisoner', 'set', 'village', 'where', 'original', 'Prisoner', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'there', 'see', 'Bruce', 'decked', 'out', 'same', 'outfit', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'wore', 'show', 'Other', 'funny', 'bits', 'occur', 'when', 'band', 'manager', 'Rod', 'Smallwood', 'discuss', 'backlash', 'NUMBER', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'received', 'America', 'Bruce', 'one', 'guy', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'carry', 'huge', '25-foot', 'cross', 'same', 'cross', 'Jesus', 'carried', 'see', 'means', 'protest', 'front', 'venue', 'Smallwood', 'then', 'how', 'people', 'started', 'burning', 'copies', 'album', 'then', 'decided', 'smash', 'instead', 'hammers', 'fumes', 'Devil', 'music', 'would', 'poison', 'atmosphere', 'Hilarious', 'stuff.The', 'bonus', 'materials', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'see', 'extra', 'equally', 'detailed', 'interviews', 'were', 'cut', 'final', 'program', 'two', 'shots', 'Adrian', 'Smith', 'playing', 'riffs', 'Children', 'Damned', 'Number', 'Beast', 'poignant', 'message', 'Clive', 'Burr', 'thanking', 'fans', 'support', 'struggle', 'MS', 'performance', 'Hallowed', 'Be', 'Thy', 'Name', 'Rock', 'Rio', 'concert', 'was', 'best', '.Overall', 'well-made', 'interesting', 'humorous', 'short', 'little', 'portrait', 'world', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'dedication', 'one', 'heavy', 'metal', 'finest']",N/A

Bruce brought about a major change in Iron Maiden's sound and presentation.  Sadly, &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; was the last album for drummer Clive Burr.  Burr, who has never been interviewed about his days in the band, does appear in this DVD.  That alone makes it worth owning in my opinion.  Martin Birch takes the viewer through the mixing and production aspects of the album and this is also very enjoyable. Buy this DVD!  I saw the band on this tour and can tell you this is probably the best lineup they ever had.  Clive Burr and Steve Harris make for an extemely solid rhythm section and the addition of Bruce Dickinson means there is not a weak link anywhere in this lineup.  &quot;Up The Hammers&quot; Clive and thanks!

Its great to see these boys interviewed on the album that struck the gold mine for them. Seeing Steve and Bruce add a bit of humor in their discussion was very cool, as well as hearing Dave and Adrian talk about the album. Funny accent Murray has going on there, but its all good since he is a guitar god, and seeing Clive Burr their former drummer interviewed as well, I thought was remarkable, I hope he comes over his disease.Even Nicko Mcbrain was interviewed, since he was dressed as one of the devil's in the # of the beast vid, funny stuff. Too bad Gers wasnt interviewd on his thoughts of the album since its one of his favorite albums, but I think the interviews were really just for all of those featured on the album's play, musically as well as all in it at that time. Dave Mustaine being interviewed was cool too, since maiden was one of his main influences as well as the Deth boys, he gives a little piece on what he thinks about the band.At the end of the disc, it has features that tell you a bit about Maiden's manager Rod Smallwood, as well as the twin guitarists at that time, and the short message for clive, as well as seeing smith play a bit of # of the beast and children of the damned. The closing shows a glimpse of Maiden's upcoming live dvd Rock in Rio, features the song Hallowed be thy name with the 3 guitar attack. Funny how someone talked trash about Gers, yet talks about how amazing the Rock in RIo song was played as well as the upcomming dvd, while Gers plays on the vid as well as doing Smith's original solo, which I dont mind, because as fast and as raw as the song was being played, Gers fit the que and did outstanding, smith wouldnt have been able to play that fast since he is not much of a dreader, he is still an amazing guitarist too of course. Anyway this dvd is worth owning whether you know about all the info or not about the album, this is the story about the album as well as the singer that made Maiden become Metal Gods.
