Turns out, not only is the movie interesting, I might even go out on a limb and say it's a classic in some kind of weird way!The MANY plot twists, the comedy and drama segments combined *perfectly* to keep your attention, and just *every single line* that's delivered by the characters... wow what a film!  I'm seriously quite shocked just how good it was.  I never would have expected a quality film of this level.Anyway, the story is about two guys and a woman who come up with this complex plan to take someones money over a pay phone... but many MANY things go wrong along the way, including some murders and trying to cover their tracks and explain themselves to the police, and it's just incredible how exciting the storyline is.  I'm by no means a fan of that guy from the hit TV show Friends, but something about his performance here... he totally nails it.This is the kind of movie I'd like to watch again to catch all the little jokes I may have missed, along with trying to figure out exactly what was going on the entire time (because let's be honest, with so many things happening at once, it's real easy for your mind to get a little bit confused at times!)And WOW is Alice Eve a hot actress!

His lugubrious manner is perfectly complimented by bouncy, James-Cagney-like Simon Pegg, a British comedian donning a perfect American accent. Their screen chemistry is wonderful.Joining them is another Brit with another perfect American accent plus tremendous sex appeal, Alice Eve, playing a third kooky wheel in this unlikely team of extortionists. I gotta say: the acting by everyone (Brit, American, and Canadian) is top-notch.The script by Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Andrea and American Billy Asher tries to avoid cliches -- or at least improve on them -- and Andrea's direction gives the film a slightly surreal touch altho the film retains a down-to-earth quality.That surreal touch plus its dark quality may limit this film's appeal, but those who like terrific acting and fast-paced fun may revel in that appeal.(To people who have already seen the film: there's a difference of opinion here and at the Amazon UK site about Simon Pegg's accent. I think that those who are familiar with Simon Pegg will be influenced by that familiarity and find his accent strange -- while those of us who aren't familiar with him will find his accent perfect, albeit energetic, Midwestern.

Pegg had starred in Shaun of the Dead two years earlier but that film took a few years to become a smash hit, Hot Fuzz wasn't released until a year after this and other big box office films later than that.  If this was a fresh new film today with Pegg a household name I think it would be a lot more successful.The film itself is a fun one.  It's not a realistic film by any means, but that's what makes it fun.  Dark comedy would probably be the best way to describe this one.  It's basically about an extortion plan by a group of strangers coming together who are in desperate need for money that doesn't go according to plan, but other than that it is best to go into this not knowing much, as the turns in the plot and surprises are what make it so enjoyable.  Pegg's character Gus, is a little different to his usual Paul, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz characters but there are still enough similarities for fans of those films.

Playing on the now tried-n-true formula for these kinds of flicks, which is kind of sad. I remember when this was a fairly fresh concept back in the early 1990's, gotta give Tarantino credit where credit is due.It took twenty years - but now this type of production is now so ploddingly predictable.Only thing I enjoyed screening this movie: Simon Pegg doing a turn as a no-good bleeping bleep. A bit of a role changer as he's almost always the good egg. But, dang, he's still funny playing a turd.Otherwise, a passable flick if you enjoy these blood-soaked-who-gets-to-live-while-fighting-for-the-money productions.Note: Maybe it's me, but while watching the ubiquitous blonde babe, I honestly thought was watching Rebecca Romijn. It wasn't until after the film that I found out that she has a ""twin sister"" in Alice Eve.Would *love* to see a movie with the two of them playing unrelated roles.

Not terrible, just not really great. It's worth a watch.
