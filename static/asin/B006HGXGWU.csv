Doing so will save you from a disastrous flick, which features fifteen minutes worth of story drawn out over two agonizing hours.Don't worry: no spoilers are revealed in the following discussion of this movie's events, because the outcome is utterly ambiguous. This is not the kind of ambiguity that gets you talking about the movie, talking about the ending or talking about the characters. Instead it's the kind of ambiguity that forces you do to the sad calculations about all the other things you might have done with your time had you not been watching this.Blue-collar Ohio resident Curtis has a decent job, a nice enough house, a pretty red-haired wife, a special needs (hearing impaired) daughter...and a dog. Oh yeah: he's also got a mom who was diagnosed and institutionalized with paranoid schizophrenia at the same age Curtis is now.In the months after his father's death (an event whose significance is pointed out, but is a big red herring...along with bizarre visits to his mother and from his brother), Curtis starts having bad dreams, daytime hallucinations and paralyzing panic attacks. So: he makes dog live outside, and then decides he MUST upgrade his existing storm shelter...by adding a 40-foot ISO shipping container. After wetting the bed during one dream, he goes to see his doctor (who is oh-so-coincidentally familiar with his mom's case) to discuss his symptoms. And even though it's not too hard to arrange a $6000 home improvement loan and wrangle company equipment to bury the shipping container in his back yard, it is WAY too hard to make the two hour drive to Columbus to see the psychiatrist his warm and fuzzy family doctor recommends...until way too late in the unraveling of his life.Oh yeah: we also learn his employer's generous health plan will pay for implants needed to restore his daughter's hearing...and it will only take six weeks to get the surgery scheduled! Director Jeff Nichols should have just put up a big flashing neon said that said: ""Curtis is about to get fired, lose his insurance and really agitate his wife."" Of course he does get fired (for using the company equipment at home), and from here the movie proceeds into its climax and denouement, when Curtis has an epic meltdown at a Lions' Club dinner, followed by a midwest weather event that places the whole family first in the shelter and then at the beach to confront his --and their-- fears about actual and metaphoric storms.Here's the thing: most of the characters are likeable enough and the acting is good enough that this movie could have been turned into an engaging story about something...if it could have ever figured out what that something is. This movie is part Twilight Zone episode, part pick-any-M. Night Shyamalan ""thriller"", part ""Whose Eating Gilbert Grape""...but not the right parts of any of them. And while I can accept an ambiguous ending, I can't accept a movie that is at least 30 minutes longer than it needs to be through pacing that is deliberately glacial. The time is not filled with engaging dialog or revealing actions, but with long views of stuff and people who often aren't doing anything at all.Take shelter, indeed.",1,If you have your own tornado shelter without electricity...,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,3231,"['then', 'go', 'immediately', 'should', 'decide', 'watch', 'movie', 'Doing', 'so', 'will', 'save', 'disastrous', 'flick', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'story', 'drawn', 'out', 'two', 'agonizing', 'hours.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'spoilers', 'are', 'revealed', 'following', 'discussion', 'movie', 'events', 'outcome', 'utterly', 'ambiguous', 'not', 'kind', 'ambiguity', 'talking', 'movie', 'talking', 'ending', 'talking', 'characters', 'Instead', 'kind', 'ambiguity', 'do', 'sad', 'calculations', 'other', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'time', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'watching', 'this.Blue-collar', 'Ohio', 'resident', 'Curtis', 'decent', 'job', 'nice', 'enough', 'house', 'pretty', 'red-haired', 'wife', 'special', 'needs', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'daughter', 'dog', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'also', 'got', 'mom', 'who', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'institutionalized', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'same', 'age', 'Curtis', 'months', 'father', 'death', 'event', 'significance', 'pointed', 'out', 'big', 'red', 'herring', 'bizarre', 'visits', 'mother', 'brother', 'Curtis', 'having', 'bad', 'dreams', 'daytime', 'hallucinations', 'paralyzing', 'panic', 'attacks', 'So', 'dog', 'live', 'outside', 'then', 'MUST', 'upgrade', 'existing', 'storm', 'shelter', 'adding', '40-foot', 'ISO', 'shipping', 'container', 'wetting', 'bed', 'one', 'dream', 'see', 'doctor', 'who', 'oh-so-coincidentally', 'familiar', 'mom', 'case', 'discuss', 'symptoms', 'even', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'arrange', '6000', 'home', 'improvement', 'loan', 'wrangle', 'company', 'equipment', 'bury', 'shipping', 'container', 'back', 'yard', 'WAY', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'two', 'hour', 'drive', 'Columbus', 'see', 'psychiatrist', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'family', 'doctor', 'way', 'too', 'late', 'unraveling', 'life.Oh', 'yeah', 'also', 'learn', 'employer', 'generous', 'health', 'plan', 'will', 'pay', 'implants', 'needed', 'restore', 'daughter', 'hearing', 'will', 'only', 'take', 'six', 'weeks', 'get', 'surgery', 'scheduled', 'Director', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'put', 'up', 'big', 'flashing', 'neon', 'said', 'said', 'Curtis', 'get', 'fired', 'lose', 'insurance', 'really', 'agitate', 'wife', 'course', 'get', 'fired', 'using', 'company', 'equipment', 'home', 'here', 'movie', 'climax', 'denouement', 'when', 'Curtis', 'epic', 'meltdown', 'Lions', 'Club', 'dinner', 'followed', 'midwest', 'weather', 'event', 'whole', 'family', 'first', 'shelter', 'then', 'beach', 'confront', 'fears', 'actual', 'metaphoric', 'storms.Here', 'thing', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'enough', 'acting', 'good', 'enough', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'engaging', 'story', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'something', 'movie', 'part', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'part', 'pick-any-M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'thriller', 'part', 'Whose', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'not', 'right', 'parts', 'can', 'accept', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'movie', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'longer', 'be', 'pacing', 'deliberately', 'glacial', 'time', 'not', 'filled', 'engaging', 'dialog', 'revealing', 'actions', 'long', 'views', 'stuff', 'people', 'who', 'often', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'anything', 'all.Take', 'shelter', 'indeed']",Take Shelter

1515523,AAZRWLML88IZK,B006HGXGWU,A kids review,"[6, 6]","Every year, there are a handful of films that enter and leave theaters very quietly, then pop up out of nowhere to appear all over critics' year-end lists. Take Shelter premiered last year at Sundance and ran the festival circuit, picking up a handful of awards along the way, before opening in limited release back in September. Though it failed to make enough money to recoup its already modest $5 million budget, critics raved about the film and its central performance by Michael Shannon. Shannon plays Curtis LaForche, an Ohio family man who begins dreaming about an apocalyptic storm. Deciding at first to keep the dreams to himself, Curtis pours all of his energy into building a storm shelter in his back yard; his obsession with the shelter eventually strains all the meaningful relationships in his life. A piece of subtle, nuanced filmmaking, I feel Michael Shannon's performance alone made the film worth seeing, but the film itself is a perfect blend of drama and dread. It's a slow-burn psychological mindbender that builds tension gradually, so it's not for everyone, but you can be sure you'll be witnessing some top notch filmmaking if you watch it.",5,Take Shelter,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,1166,"['year', 'are', 'handful', 'films', 'enter', 'leave', 'theaters', 'very', 'quietly', 'then', 'pop', 'up', 'nowhere', 'appear', 'critics', 'year-end', 'lists', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'premiered', 'last', 'year', 'Sundance', 'ran', 'festival', 'circuit', 'picking', 'up', 'handful', 'awards', 'way', 'opening', 'limited', 'release', 'back', 'September', 'failed', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'recoup', 'already', 'modest', '5', 'million', 'budget', 'critics', 'raved', 'film', 'central', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Shannon', 'Curtis', 'LaForche', 'Ohio', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'dreaming', 'apocalyptic', 'storm', 'Deciding', 'first', 'keep', 'dreams', 'Curtis', 'energy', 'building', 'storm', 'shelter', 'back', 'yard', 'obsession', 'shelter', 'eventually', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'life', 'piece', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'filmmaking', 'feel', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'performance', 'alone', 'made', 'film', 'seeing', 'film', 'perfect', 'blend', 'drama', 'dread', 'slow-burn', 'psychological', 'mindbender', 'tension', 'gradually', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'witnessing', 'top', 'notch', 'filmmaking', 'watch']",Take Shelter

1515528,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B006HGXGWU,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","I just want to be clear that this review is coming from someone who doesn't `get' Michael Shannon.  I don't think he's a good actor.  He annoys me.  His praised performances, including the Oscar nominated one, have always felt forced and obnoxious and awkward and quite frankly I've never liked him and usually wind up pointing my finger in his direction when explaining the `worst' part of a film.This film, and his performance inside of it, was amazing.`Take Shelter' seems to be a very divisive film.  The ambiguity that laces so much of the film, especially Shannon's character Curtis, lies at the core of that division.  You either embrace all that writer/director Jeff Nichols has to say here, or you label it a joke.  Honestly, there are few films that say more about the modern horrors of the struggle to survive quite like `Take Shelter'.  With a sharp sense of purpose, this film uses subtle imagery to pinpoint the root of Curtis's madness without every hitting you over the head with it.You may label my opinion a huge SPOILER, but I don't see it that way since I'm merely stating my interpretation of events, not their actual intent.For me, `Take Shelter' uses a looming storm to signify the pressing concern of financial instability.  Using seeming subliminal shots, Nichols highlights the weight on Curtis's shoulders from his own financial responsibilities and the fact that, as each day passes the eventual collapse of all that he has is going to take over.  His daughter has health issues that he must take care of.  His wife works hard to preserve a level of sanity in the house, but you can see the weight around her eyes of simply worrying about her future and that of her family.  Curtis sees so much on his plate and then, it all starts to unravel.  Everyone around him feels like an enemy as he envisions an incoming storm that will devastate and destroy.  Through dreams he experiences the pain of losing his daughter through odd means and this, for me, further implicates the idea that his floundering ability to provide for his family is what is aching at the core of Curtis's mental state.He's slowly going crazy.Michael Shannon is superb here.  Friends of mine had likened his performance to that of Heath Ledger's in `Brokeback Mountain' (every word, a struggle) and I get that.  It is so impeccably rendered.  The scene where he opens the storm door alone is just ""wow"".  You can see the relief etched with utter confusion all over his face.HOW CAN THIS NOT BE REAL?Jessica Chastain has had a banner year, and this is probably her finest performance.  I mean, she finds every ounce of emotional compassions here and pushes them forward in the most honest of ways.  Nichols works wonders with the air here, creating sharply intensified atmosphere that really keeps the viewer locked into what is going on.  That ending is brilliant (I know, so many gripe there but seriously, the ambiguity isn't so hard to cut through it you think about it) and the visuals are impressive.  Those storms are eerily reminiscent of our own personal demons.",5,You can't stop what's coming...,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,3068,"['just', 'want', 'be', 'clear', 'review', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'actor', 'praised', 'performances', 'including', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'one', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'forced', 'obnoxious', 'awkward', 'quite', 'frankly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'usually', 'wind', 'up', 'pointing', 'finger', 'direction', 'when', 'explaining', 'worst', 'part', 'film.This', 'film', 'performance', 'was', 'amazing.', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'be', 'very', 'divisive', 'film', 'ambiguity', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'especially', 'Shannon', 'character', 'Curtis', 'core', 'division', 'embrace', 'writer/director', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', 'say', 'here', 'label', 'joke', 'Honestly', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'say', 'more', 'modern', 'horrors', 'struggle', 'survive', 'quite', 'like', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'sharp', 'sense', 'purpose', 'film', 'subtle', 'imagery', 'pinpoint', 'root', 'Curtis', 'madness', 'hitting', 'head', 'it.You', 'may', 'label', 'opinion', 'huge', 'SPOILER', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', ""'m"", 'merely', 'stating', 'interpretation', 'events', 'not', 'actual', 'intent.For', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'looming', 'storm', 'signify', 'pressing', 'concern', 'financial', 'instability', 'Using', 'seeming', 'subliminal', 'shots', 'Nichols', 'weight', 'Curtis', 'shoulders', 'own', 'financial', 'responsibilities', 'fact', 'that', 'day', 'eventual', 'collapse', 'going', 'take', 'over', 'daughter', 'health', 'issues', 'must', 'take', 'care', 'wife', 'hard', 'preserve', 'level', 'sanity', 'house', 'can', 'see', 'weight', 'eyes', 'simply', 'worrying', 'future', 'family', 'Curtis', 'so', 'much', 'plate', 'then', 'unravel', 'Everyone', 'feels', 'enemy', 'incoming', 'storm', 'will', 'devastate', 'destroy', 'dreams', 'pain', 'losing', 'daughter', 'odd', 'means', 'further', 'idea', 'floundering', 'ability', 'provide', 'family', 'what', 'aching', 'core', 'Curtis', 'mental', 'state.He', 'slowly', 'going', 'crazy.Michael', 'Shannon', 'superb', 'here', 'Friends', 'mine', 'had', 'likened', 'performance', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'word', 'struggle', 'get', 'so', 'impeccably', 'rendered', 'scene', 'where', 'storm', 'door', 'alone', 'just', 'wow', 'can', 'see', 'relief', 'etched', 'utter', 'confusion', 'face.HOW', 'CAN', 'THIS', 'NOT', 'BE', 'REAL', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'had', 'banner', 'year', 'probably', 'finest', 'performance', 'mean', 'ounce', 'emotional', 'compassions', 'here', 'forward', 'most', 'honest', 'ways', 'Nichols', 'wonders', 'air', 'here', 'creating', 'sharply', 'intensified', 'atmosphere', 'really', 'viewer', 'locked', 'what', 'going', 'ending', 'brilliant', 'know', 'so', 'many', 'gripe', 'there', 'seriously', 'ambiguity', ""n't"", 'so', 'hard', 'cut', 'think', 'visuals', 'are', 'impressive', 'storms', 'are', 'eerily', 'reminiscent', 'own', 'personal', 'demons']",Take Shelter

1515536,A2582KMXLK2P06,B006HGXGWU,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Take Shelter is about a small town Ohio man who strongly believes something bad is going to happen to him.  He spends all his time hallucinating the most horrific events will occur at any given moment such as tornadoes heading for his home, birds circling in the sky indicating impending doom, loud crashes of thunder and lightning that only he can hear but not his workmates, strangers standing in the rain outside his home preparing to break in, furniture unexplainably lifting from his living room floor, etc.  The problem is... I just named all the good moments.  Besides this, the rest of the movie is extremely tedious to watch due to being incredibly boring.Even his wife is a typical midtown-type lady who really serves no purpose as far as storyline development goes- she's only there so we can have more characters besides a hallucinating freak of a husband/father.  I seriously don't even think those who suffer from worrying constantly about potential serious danger would find Take Shelter interesting either- it does nothing to help people who suffer from these conditions.  It's too bland to really accomplish anything for *any* type of movie watcher.  I also seriously question whether Ohio's lands are as flat as portrayed in this movie, allowing tornadoes to be more frequent.  Maybe portions of the western half of the state.The man spends all his time either building his meaningless shelter in the back yard (without his wifes consent, heh) or talking to psychiatrists/taking medication for his lack of sleep/hallucinations.  I seriously can't remember a movie that felt so uninspiring and worthless to watch.  Over two *hours* of this stuff, too.  I feel like a total fool for watching it.  I feel foolish for believing the movie description was suspenseful and focused on tornadoes or a heavy atmosphere pertaining to storm activity- not really.  Oh and was the ending supposed to justify the 2 hours of boredom we had to persevere?  Give me a break.

TAKE SHELTER is about a man named Curtis, played by Michael Shannon, who is a hard working husband and father in a small and close knit community in Arkansas. He starts having apocalyptic dreams of devastating storms and becomes obsessed with building a particularly elaborate storm shelter. His behavior soons alienates him from friends, co-workers and ultimately his family. As the audience we are given the choice to believe in his vision or go along with the rest of the community in branding him crazy and/or someone on the verge of a mental breakdown or possibly schizophrenic. The story, for myself, seems to be an allegory of how many people in today's society tend to easily dismiss individuals who have views that make them uncomfortable or uneasy. We tend to be lulled into beliefs that correspond to our most comfortable and least fearful theories and correspond to the beliefs coerced by mass manipulation. This can be quite detrimental to society as a whole when we rely so much on the judgements of groups instead of relying on our own truths. The great thing about this film is that it is one of those films that everyone will have a different take on. I believe that it is one of the director's primary intensions when making this film. It's a movie where if you see it with a group of people there will be great discussions afterwards. I also have to emphazise the incredible acting by everyone but particularly by Michael Shannon. The intensity he brings to his role is brilliant.

1515539,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B006HGXGWU,Brian Driver,"[1, 1]","There are NO SPOILERS here!I knew nothing about this movie when I ordered it on Netflix other than these two things:1) the trailer looked interesting, and2) Michael Shannon intrigues meOn that basis, I ordered ""Take Shelter,"" and while I can not say I loved it, I can not say I hated it either.  Hence the three stars.Understand this: it's a good, thoughtful movie, but the unhurried, deliberate pace is only for those who like serious films more interested in building characterization than a frenetic plot.I do believe this movie is well made in the sense that it gives us a realistic construction of a man on the edge and does so within the confines of a middle income working class family in a midwestern state not prone toward hysteria or even colorful words and sustained monologues.This is, in fact, the exact opposite of a David Mamet film, wherein words are batted around like a Jai Alai ball.  There are long scenes in which Michael Shannon slumps on a chair looking glum, and others stare at him.  LONG scenes.But understand they are appropriate to the seriousness of the subject.  It has the feel of an indie film on within tight funding, and writer/director Jeff Nichols is able to do a good job within an apparently low budget creating apocalyptic visions that seem to exist solely within the head of character Curtis LaForche, played by Michael Shannon.  (Is the name ""LaForche"" important: a misspelling of ""fork,"" as in perhaps a character in the fork in the road, deciding where to go?)The fact that he has these vivid dreams not only when he sleeps, but also when his eyes are wide open and he is awake fully awake is complicated by the additional fact that his mother is in a care facility because when she was approximately his age she had a breakdown due to her own paranoid schizophrenia.Given the obvious misgivings he must himself obsess over, Curtis feels the less said, the better, except that his wife--well played by Jessica Chastain--has noticed his odd behavior and is seriously frightened for AND of him.  Trying her best to deal with a deaf daughter who needs an operation, and the fact that the only money they can scrape together through his job, odd work, and yard sales is being funneled away to build a shelter he believes necessary to shield his family from the upcoming disaster he foresees.Nichols is not interested in making a sci-fi film, but in constructing a careful moment-by-moment character study of a man on the edge, as upset as he is by his visions of the end of the world as he is that it all may simply be his descent into madness, just like his mother.  Chastain is also portrayed as a fully realized character who is trying so hard to do the right thing: to stand by her man as he crumbles before her very eyes.I had seen only one other film with Michael Shannon: the EXTREMELY odd ""Bug,"" which should indeed creep you out if you ever do see it.  He is quite haunting there, too, as he portrays a man who may or may not be there to rescue Ashley Judd.  It's all a testament to his face: a large misshapen head like Dudley Do-Right's after a catastrophic motorcycle accident.  His jutting jaw and obsessed eyes register misgivings like a seismograph, giving off a look that is equally paranoic and frightening.So see ""Take Shelter"" if you are interested in watching a well made movie about people, and only secondarily in watching a movie that may or may not be about a disaster.  It takes forever to get where it wants to go, but rest assured this movie delivers a punch when it does.If, however, you do not like long character studies, steer clear.

In prior times, a man like Curtis would not be assumed to be mentally ill.  The fact that he is having visions would be respected by both the bible and in native folk lore as he would be seen as a possible prophet in their midst.  Curtis's mother has been in long time care since she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic.  However, when we meet her, the question is really open as to her as well.  We live in an age where science has decreed that things like portents, omens, seers, prophets and the like are impossible.  That anyone who deals in this matter is just plain loco.Curtis begins turning his storm shelter into more of an atomic bomb like shelter and runs into one person after another who is teed off at him, from his employer to his colleague to his wife.  Yet he persists.  What he sees is supported by reports which have been filed around catastrophes. For example, when tidal waves come in, birds do go crazy.  They swarm and take off and some, in their hurry to get out, drop dead from the sky to the ground.So the big question is whether Curtis is having a psychotic break with reality or if he is a seer who feels and sees a disaster coming.  I know most people are going with the mental illness interpretation.  Personally, I think since this this kind of person has been chronicled for thousands of years that it is possible that such a person could exist but does not want to broadcast his visions for precisely the reason that people will think he is insane.Michael Shannon as Curtis and Jessica Chastain as his wife are both terrific.One caution about this movie: it is very slow.

1515543,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B006HGXGWU,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[5, 6]","The simplicity of ""Take Shelter,"" Jeff Nichols' critically acclaimed 2011 art-house film, is its brilliance. From the opening scene, when a man stands alone and studies an approaching storm, there's a deep instinctive chord that rings like the chime of distant sirens. Storms kill, and nature's ominous fury can scatter humans like so many insects. The storm's pall covers the film through a series of dreams, and its producing a dark rain drenching the land in ""motor oil"" sludge. On a regular basis, we read about global warming and its effects upon our planet. We watch Werner Herzog's 2007 documentaryEncounters at the End of the World [Blu-ray], in which a population of isolated scientists working in the Antarctica respond unanimously without hesitation that its affects are increasing on a monthly basis. Hurricanes and tornadoes are more numerous than ever before, slamming New Orleans and Joplin, Missouri. Ancient ice is cracking for the first time in recorded history. Something terrifyingly dangerous is on the horizon and it's marching towards us.The always interesting actor Michael Shannon plays Curtis, a modest Ohio family man who struggles to make ends meet. He wears a hardhat on the job as a contractor, sweating daily with machines that drill into the delicate earth to create trenches. He works alongside his best friend Dewart (Shea Whigham), brown-bagging lunch and having a beer afterwards at the local pub. In the morning, he has a quick breakfast of scrambled eggs with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart). Their daughter is deaf, and they discuss the difficult finances that might allow her corrective surgery. The vivid dreams continue with the world wracked by storms and an unseen menace attacking his home. We learn mental illness runs in his family and Curtis, in a beautifully subtle scene, pays a visit to his mother (Kathy Baker) who suffers from schizophrenia. Finding no comfortable answers, he checks in with the family doctor and tries to explain his terrifying visions. Curtis cannot overcome a deep, growing dread of approaching danger, and he is soon constructing elaborate additions to the backyard tornado shelter.""Take Shelter"" is one of those rare films where one is never sure what is going to happen next. There is suspense, but the drama's driving force is Curtis' attempts to remain calm when terror is just beneath his panicked surface. Every fiber of his being is telling him to take shelter with his family, and he jeopardizes a good life to do just that. We're never sure if the visions are valid or if Curtis is suffering an extraordinary mental breakdown, but his irrational behavior soon alienates friends and neighbors.There is no convenient category to place ""Take Shelter"" into, though one could call it a quiet version of M. Night Shyamalan's underrated 2008 filmThe Happening. This is also a darker version of Phil Alden Robinson's whimsical 1989 workField of Dreams [Blu-ray], in which a farmer (Kevin Costner) hears voices and risks his family and career to build a baseball field. But Costner's character was hearing a voice of God, while Shannon's Curtis is possessed by hellish visions of approaching doom. There's a small thread connecting these films in that, the undeniable strength of respectful love holds a couple together no matter the chaos. Chastain's Samantha (in an equally strong performance) is horrified by her husband's behavior, but chooses to stand by him because she knows the goodness within. Together they bore a child and life, and she's not going to give it up easily. With growing unease she takes the helm, making plans to overcome his choices that have risked their financial future.""Take Shelter"" is a disturbingly subtle document of modern times, when the fear of environmental catastrophe, financial recession and the destruction of America's working middle class looms over the land. Curtis' difficult attempts to find proper health care and financing for his daughter's surgery is another stressor having great relevance. It's no wonder all of us don't have breakdowns, looking for protective shelter to ride out a tsunami which may end American society as we know it. Curtis is crumbling from the pressure, but Samantha refuses to allow him to succumb, and together they nod in agreement to face the coming storm.With a few thought provoking moments, what Nichols' incredible work has done is provide profound inspiration to every family struggling to survive. ""Take Shelter"" is a film for adults wrought with the humble responsibilities of raising a family, who have avoided by necessity the numbing drugs of 24-hour technological consumerism.

1515547,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B006HGXGWU,DanD,"[1, 1]","Curtis is a layman who lives in the Midwest with his wife and child.  Like many Midwestern family men, he has a fear of storms.  Except his fear is sudden and decidedly acute.  Curtis begins having vivid dreams of an approaching storm, and strange rains that drive people mad.  His nightmares become waking visions, and he begins to invest--at his family's expense--in the tornado shelter in the backyard.  Just in case.Michael Shannon, as Curtis, gives a stellar performance.  At times hauntingly poignant, at others frustratingly off-putting--his meltdown is a stunner--he holds your attention to the screen and never lets it go, even when the film meanders.  Jessica Chastain, as Curtis's wife Samantha, is forced to play second fiddle, but it's still another great 2011 performance for her (even if you hated it, and I'm not taking sides here, you have to admit that Chastain was fantastic in Terrence Malick's TREE OF LIFE).  Even the supporting parts--Tova Stewart as Curtis's daughter, Shea Whigham as his friend/coworker--are ably cast, and the acting here is one of the film's great strengths.  Another is the visual effects, which are utterly captivating; there are a few scenes--Samantha in the kitchen, the birds, all the stellar storm imagery--that are worth the price of admission alone, in addition to the film's other strengths.Jeff Nichols's direction is solid and assured.  This is, at its most basic, a horror film, but you never truly feel it.  Nichols doesn't go for the cliched ""shock"" factor (which ultimately weakens the film's conclusion, but that's for those of you who've seen it already), instead letting the horror of his story sink in naturally.  This is TAKE SHELTER'S most redeeming factor, but it comes with a price: when a film revolves around the ""is he/isn't he"" question, audiences demand an answer.  At 2 hours, TAKE SHELTER stretches the wait until it's breaking point.  There's a lot of build-up, so much so that the final answer seems not worth the while.  Granted, Nichols's point is that the ""twist"" is irrelevant: this is a character study, about a man and his family suffering what is (for all intents and purposes, be it true or not) mental illness.  But still, there's a bit of filler in this film, and that keeps it from being everything it could be.  Still, if you like solid filmmaking and fantastic performances, TAKING SHELTER is definitely worth your time.",4,"A visually mesmerizing, emotionally resonant film.",1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2409,"['Curtis', 'layman', 'who', 'Midwest', 'wife', 'child', 'many', 'Midwestern', 'family', 'men', 'fear', 'storms', 'fear', 'sudden', 'decidedly', 'acute', 'Curtis', 'having', 'vivid', 'dreams', 'approaching', 'storm', 'strange', 'rains', 'drive', 'people', 'mad', 'become', 'waking', 'visions', 'invest', 'family', 'expense', 'tornado', 'shelter', 'backyard', 'Just', 'case.Michael', 'Shannon', 'Curtis', 'stellar', 'performance', 'times', 'hauntingly', 'poignant', 'others', 'frustratingly', 'off-putting', 'meltdown', 'stunner', 'attention', 'screen', 'never', 'go', 'even', 'when', 'film', 'meanders', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Curtis', 'wife', 'Samantha', 'forced', 'play', 'second', 'fiddle', 'still', 'great', '2011', 'performance', 'even', 'hated', ""'m"", 'not', 'taking', 'sides', 'here', 'have', 'admit', 'Chastain', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'Even', 'supporting', 'parts', 'Tova', 'Stewart', 'Curtis', 'daughter', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'friend/coworker', 'are', 'ably', 'cast', 'acting', 'here', 'one', 'film', 'great', 'strengths', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'utterly', 'captivating', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'Samantha', 'kitchen', 'birds', 'stellar', 'storm', 'imagery', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'addition', 'film', 'other', 'strengths.Jeff', 'Nichols', 'direction', 'solid', 'assured', 'most', 'basic', 'horror', 'film', 'never', 'truly', 'feel', 'Nichols', ""n't"", 'go', 'cliched', 'shock', 'factor', 'ultimately', 'film', 'conclusion', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'instead', 'letting', 'horror', 'story', 'sink', 'naturally', 'TAKE', 'SHELTER', 'most', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'price', 'when', 'film', 'he/is', ""n't"", 'question', 'audiences', 'demand', 'answer', '2', 'hours', 'TAKE', 'SHELTER', 'wait', 'breaking', 'point', 'lot', 'build-up', 'so', 'much', 'final', 'answer', 'not', 'while', 'Granted', 'Nichols', 'point', 'twist', 'irrelevant', 'character', 'study', 'man', 'family', 'suffering', 'what', 'intents', 'purposes', 'be', 'true', 'not', 'mental', 'illness', 'still', 'bit', 'filler', 'film', 'being', 'everything', 'could', 'be', 'Still', 'like', 'solid', 'filmmaking', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'TAKING', 'SHELTER', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time']",Take Shelter

In the aftermath of his visions, Curtis is haunted by his mother's schizophrenia and the real fear of losing his family due to a series of lunatic choices that backfire in the worst possible ways.In _Take Shelter_, writer/director Jeff Nichols has given us a Twilight Zone episode for the arthouse movie crowd. The idea of a powerful evil lurking in the small town Ohio suburbs feels ripped from a David Lynch film, and protagonist Curtis, his dedicated wife, and their deaf, 6-year-old daughter prove the perfect framing characters for the impending doom.Packed with career-making acting, _Take Shelter_ is a deliberate nightmare, mimicking the kind of slow-paced horror ethos found in European frightfests of the '70s and '80s. Excellent, expansive cinematography gives us not only a perfect front row seat for Curtis's descent into madness but also an in-your-face look at the stark visage of actor Michael Shannon as the nervous tics take hold. Each dream unfolds with thunder, and we are sucked into its swirling paranoia.Despite all the accolades for _Take Shelter_, it contains enough weaknesses so as to collapse for most viewers.When a film's premise and its plotline can be written in their entirety with the same dozen words, that's a depth problem. As noted, _Take Shelter_ has the feel of a Twilight Zone episode--""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" immediately springs to mind-- but an episode of that show ran for just under 25 minutes. This film runs 121. Though director Nichols lavishes care on every scene to the benefit of its creepiness, better editing might have trimmed this to an equally worth 100 minutes. And in the end, this is a one-note film. Anyone familiar with the aforementioned Twilight Zone episode knows the course of _Take Shelter_ within its first ten minutes. With the ending inevitable, the journey becomes more of a slog. That another 111 minutes follow might have viewers hitting their remote's fast forward button, which defeats the point of the director's attention to detail.Certainly, with most American films amped up on adrenaline, audiences need to learn how to appreciate a slower film. But such a film needs to deliver more than an interminable trudge to a predetermined finish. _Take Shelter_ simply doesn't deliver more than the inevitable. This is shame for such a well-made film.As to the DVD itself, the transfer is sharp and the sound perfect. This version of the DVD lacked frills, and I suspect all the typical extras were held back for the Blu-Ray version.Much to admire here.

Amith (kndy),"[4, 6]","When a family begins to have nightmares that begin to change his life and affect his family and job, many wonder if he is going crazy.Receiving rave reviews from critics nationwide is the 2011 film ""Take Shelter"" written and directed by Jeff Nichols (""Shotgun Stories"").  The film stars Michael Shannon (""Vanilla Sky"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Bad Boys II"") and Jessica Chastain (""The Help"", ""The Tree of Life"").""Take Shelter"" screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011 and won the 50th Critics' Week Grand Prix and won various film awards internationally.And now the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Take Shelter"" is presented in 2:35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH and French.  First, I just want to add that  if anyone wants to experience the best picture and audio quality for ""Take Shelter"", you will definitely want to watch this movie on Blu-ray!With that being said, ""Take Shelter"" looks very good on DVD.  There are a lot of scenes that are shot outdoors, scenes with blue skies are vibrant. While I was watching this film on DVD, I kept telling myself of how beautiful those scenes would look in HD!  I didn't notice any problems with the overall picture quality, the film looks very good on DVD.As for audio, the soundtrack features certain dream sequences that utilize the surround channels.  From Curtis' dog attacking him, getting into an accident, hearing the sounds of the crackling storm to the reality sequences such as ambiance during one crowd scene during a fight.  Overall, dialogue is clear, action sequences sound good on DVD.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Take Shelter"" comes with the following special features:Commentary with Jeff Nichols & Michael Shannon - Featuring in-depth commentary by director Jeff Nichols and actor Michael Shannon.Behind the Scenes of Take Shelter - (10:35) Writer and director Jeff Nichols talks about how he came up with ""Take Shelter"", the actors talk about their character and the film.Q&A; with Michael Shannon & Shea Whigham - (19:51) Featuring a Q&A; session with actors Michael Shannon and Shea Wigham discussing how the film came about and their characters.Deleted Scenes - (6:00) Featuring two deleted scenes: Second Counselor Session and Picnic TableTheatrical Trailer  - (2:12) The original theatrical trailer for ""Take Shelter"".JUDGMENT CALL:A unique story with a twist ending, writer/director Jeff Nichols' ""Take Shelter"" is a film that will surprise you but also captivate you with the wonderful performances by Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain!I have to admit that when I first watched the trailer for ""Take Shelter"", the first thing that came into my mind was the Russell Crowe 2001 film, ""A Beautiful Mind"".Is this another film about schizophrenia?  But there is no denying that when this film started to win one award after another, perhaps there was more to this film than what we are given in the trailer.  And there is also no denying that the director of 2007 ""Shotgun Stories"", Jeff Nichols is a person that has creative ideas and suffice to say, his name is being mentioned quite often.  The same can also be said for the film's talents, Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain.  And so far, Chastain has literally made me a fan with her performances on ""The Tree of Life"", ""The Help"" and her bit part in the ""Texas Killing Fields"".But it's Nichols story that starts to unnerve viewers. Here is a normal family that will probably be destroyed by the actions of the protagonist Curtis.  He's a hardworking family man, but when he starts having these dark nightmares of being attacked and getting in accidents with his daughter and needless to say, he starts to act on them.  You know that things are not going to look good for Curtis.And as for the apocalyptic dream of a major storm coming his way, its the big part of the storyline as Curtis dedicates his life into building this storm shelter.  He wants to protect his family and be prepared, but of course, with his mother being mentally ill, many wonder if Curtis is also ill.But it's the way that ""Take Shelter"" ends that makes this film so satisfying and unforgettable.As for the DVD release, you do get a pretty in-depth audio commentary by Jeff Nichols and Michael Shannon and also a few features such as deleted scenes, a featurette featuring behind-the-scenes interviews with the writer/director and cast members plus a Q&A; between Michael Shannon & Shea Whigham.Overall, ""Take Shelter"" is an impressive film from Jeff Nichols and I would not be surprised if we start to see and hear more from this talented writer and filmmaker.  Unfortunately, the film was snubbed for any Academy Award nominations considering the number of awards it had won internationally, but still, ""Take Shelter"" is a fantastic film with a engrossing story with powerful performances.""Take Shelter"" is recommended!",4,A film that will surprise you but also captivate you with the wonderful performances by Michael Shannon and Jessica

I was just taking a chance on this one, after watching the trailer and seeing the visual effects, it was a why not? choice. Shortly after the movie began though, I was hooked until the very last scenes.  It is a great psychological thriller as well as having some really good special effects, which are added at points to maximize the tension.  This movie surprised me by taking me from the point of being almost bored to being really frightened many times through the movie. In the end I was just outright intrigued, engaged and mesmerized by it.  Even the ending left me a little unsure whether I had just seen one of the best movies ever, or one of the worst!

1515559,A1URWB7HMON61C,B006HGXGWU,dra,"[0, 0]","This is a very good film that is enhanced by knowing as little as possible about it. You may wish to read no further.Curtis (Michael Shannon) lives in Ohio with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and deaf daughter Hannah. He works in construction, and Samantha makes ends meet by doing ironing and selling her embroidery at the local market. Hannah needs corrective surgery, and they're lucky enough that Curtis's health insurance will cover this. Curtis starts having dreams of lightning storms and tornadoes. In the dreams, birds swoop and swarm and fall from the sky, and friends and loved ones turn against him. He starts to have trouble telling dreams from reality. He consults medical textbooks, mindful of his own family history of mental illness, and wonders if he should see a psychiatrist. Curtis starts to pour his scant resources into reinforcing his tornado shelter, and his behaviour becomes too erratic for his employer or his small community to ignore.At first glance, this film seemed to fall into the genre of, &#34;Is he crazy, or is he so sane it will BLOW YOUR MIND?&#34; Usually, such films show their hand early, all the better to sympathise with the protagonist, who the audience knows is the only one in possession of the truth. Take Shelter maintains its ambiguity until the last 15 minutes. It embraces the implication that some of these stories must be about a descent into mental illness, and makes it clear that, even if Curtis is somehow right, he's burned an awful lot of bridges.Curtis's dreams are also scary as hell, when they move from the storms (spooky enough in themselves in the tornado-prone midwest) to lurking figures, abduction, and an effects sequence that's all the more breathtaking in the middle of a film that otherwise maintains an unexpectedly matter-of-fact tone.Take Shelter manages to point out the inequity and exclusivity of the American health system without belabouring the point. It also fits into an expanding genre of environmental catastrophe films, which must say something about the zeitgeist.Michael Shannon (stolid in Boardwalk Empire, electric in The Runaways, shouty as General Zod) is excellent throughout, conveying Curtis's torment through a largely internalised performance, against which his larger displays of emotion appear wholly in character rather than being an actor's showpiece. Jessica Chastain is splendid once again, and makes all of Samantha's reactions entirely consistent with what would a smart, concerned, loyal wife and mother might do in response to her husband's apparently baseless obsession.Absorbing, frightening and moving, Take Shelter is worth tracking down.",4,Absorbing and deeply frightening descent into madness,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,2657,"['very', 'good', 'film', 'enhanced', 'knowing', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'may', 'wish', 'read', 'further.Curtis', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Ohio', 'wife', 'Samantha', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'deaf', 'daughter', 'Hannah', 'construction', 'Samantha', 'ends', 'meet', 'doing', 'ironing', 'selling', 'embroidery', 'local', 'market', 'Hannah', 'corrective', 'surgery', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'Curtis', 'health', 'insurance', 'will', 'cover', 'Curtis', 'having', 'dreams', 'lightning', 'storms', 'tornadoes', 'dreams', 'birds', 'swoop', 'swarm', 'fall', 'sky', 'friends', 'loved', 'ones', 'turn', 'have', 'trouble', 'telling', 'dreams', 'reality', 'medical', 'textbooks', 'mindful', 'own', 'family', 'history', 'mental', 'illness', 'wonders', 'should', 'see', 'psychiatrist', 'Curtis', 'pour', 'scant', 'resources', 'reinforcing', 'tornado', 'shelter', 'behaviour', 'too', 'erratic', 'employer', 'small', 'community', 'ignore.At', 'first', 'glance', 'film', 'seemed', 'fall', 'genre', '34', 'crazy', 'so', 'sane', 'will', 'BLOW', 'YOUR', 'MIND', '34', 'Usually', 'such', 'films', 'show', 'hand', 'early', 'better', 'sympathise', 'protagonist', 'who', 'audience', 'only', 'one', 'possession', 'truth', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'ambiguity', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'implication', 'stories', 'must', 'be', 'descent', 'mental', 'illness', 'clear', 'even', 'Curtis', 'somehow', 'right', 'burned', 'awful', 'lot', 'bridges.Curtis', 'dreams', 'are', 'also', 'scary', 'hell', 'when', 'move', 'storms', 'spooky', 'enough', 'tornado-prone', 'midwest', 'lurking', 'figures', 'abduction', 'effects', 'sequence', 'more', 'breathtaking', 'middle', 'film', 'otherwise', 'unexpectedly', 'matter-of-fact', 'tone.Take', 'Shelter', 'point', 'out', 'inequity', 'exclusivity', 'American', 'health', 'system', 'belabouring', 'point', 'also', 'expanding', 'genre', 'environmental', 'catastrophe', 'films', 'must', 'say', 'something', 'zeitgeist.Michael', 'Shannon', 'stolid', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'electric', 'Runaways', 'shouty', 'General', 'Zod', 'excellent', 'conveying', 'Curtis', 'torment', 'largely', 'internalised', 'performance', 'larger', 'displays', 'emotion', 'appear', 'wholly', 'character', 'rather', 'being', 'actor', 'showpiece', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'splendid', 'once', 'again', 'Samantha', 'reactions', 'entirely', 'consistent', 'what', 'would', 'smart', 'concerned', 'loyal', 'wife', 'mother', 'might', 'do', 'response', 'husband', 'apparently', 'baseless', 'obsession.Absorbing', 'frightening', 'moving', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'tracking', 'down']",Take Shelter

The great Ebert gave it two thumbs up simply because of its creative ending, and I would heartily concur for that and other reasons. When it comes to handling a clich&eacute; of a subject - the apocalypse - 'Take Shelter' seems to be drawing from the biblical story of Noah. Rest assured, this movie is not another 'Evan Almighty' spoof on how to save people from their own environmental irresponsibility. Instead of building an ark, however, Curtis, with the tentative support of his wife and child, ventures into a half-cocked notion of building an impregnable storm shelter on the outskirts of a little Texas oil town in the middle of Tornado Alley. This is, ironically, Bible-Belt land but Curtis finds it hard to enlist the help of his God-fearing neighbours. They're just too busy making money drilling for gas and oil to take him seriously about the big one coming. To complicate matters, Curtis comes from a family with a history of schizophrenia which makes his visions potentially suspect. This low-budget, even-keeled, and well-managed movie has a number of timely confrontations where Curtis and his immediate family put everything on the line to see this disjointed scheme through one way or the other. The interesting thing here is that the filmmaker keeps the action moving in the direction of a climax that the audience isn't entirely prepared for. While Curtis is bracing for the big one, his loyal and long-suffering wife and child are hoping for a medical recovery with life returning to normal. At this juncture, the plot has a potentially win-win ending to it. If the world comes to an end, as foreshadowed by darkening skies and lots of heavy rain, Curtis becomes the hero and makes a believer out of his sceptical wife. If it doesn't pan out, his wife will then be able to help a shattered Curtis back to normalcy. Watch this movie if you want to see how the screen writers throw a curve at the audience who, if they are anyway like me, may have been lulled into thinking that this film is simply a parody on those who would fixate out of fear on end-times.",4,A Curious Study of the Apocalyptic Mind,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,2217,"['Here', 'strange', 'twisty', 'cinematic', 'take', 'become', 'very', 'popular', 'viewing', 'theme', 'past', 'release', ""'2012"", 'great', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'two', 'up', 'simply', 'creative', 'ending', 'would', 'heartily', 'concur', 'other', 'reasons', 'When', 'handling', 'clich', 'eacute', 'subject', 'apocalypse', 'Shelter', 'be', 'drawing', 'biblical', 'story', 'Noah', 'Rest', 'assured', 'movie', 'not', ""'Evan"", 'Almighty', 'spoof', 'how', 'save', 'people', 'own', 'environmental', 'irresponsibility', 'Instead', 'building', 'ark', 'however', 'Curtis', 'tentative', 'support', 'wife', 'child', 'ventures', 'half-cocked', 'notion', 'building', 'impregnable', 'storm', 'shelter', 'outskirts', 'little', 'Texas', 'oil', 'town', 'middle', 'Tornado', 'Alley', 'ironically', 'Bible-Belt', 'land', 'Curtis', 'hard', 'enlist', 'help', 'God-fearing', 'neighbours', ""'re"", 'just', 'too', 'busy', 'making', 'money', 'drilling', 'gas', 'oil', 'take', 'seriously', 'big', 'one', 'coming', 'complicate', 'matters', 'Curtis', 'family', 'history', 'schizophrenia', 'visions', 'potentially', 'suspect', 'low-budget', 'even-keeled', 'well-managed', 'movie', 'number', 'timely', 'confrontations', 'where', 'Curtis', 'immediate', 'family', 'put', 'everything', 'line', 'see', 'disjointed', 'scheme', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'interesting', 'thing', 'here', 'filmmaker', 'action', 'moving', 'direction', 'climax', 'audience', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'prepared', 'Curtis', 'bracing', 'big', 'one', 'loyal', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'child', 'are', 'hoping', 'medical', 'recovery', 'life', 'returning', 'normal', 'juncture', 'plot', 'potentially', 'win-win', 'ending', 'world', 'end', 'foreshadowed', 'darkening', 'skies', 'lots', 'heavy', 'rain', 'Curtis', 'hero', 'believer', 'sceptical', 'wife', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'wife', 'will', 'then', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'shattered', 'Curtis', 'back', 'normalcy', 'Watch', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'screen', 'writers', 'throw', 'curve', 'audience', 'who', 'are', 'anyway', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lulled', 'thinking', 'film', 'simply', 'parody', 'who', 'would', 'fixate', 'fear', 'end-times']",Take Shelter

He attempts to communicate this notion to his friends, family, and co-workers; to no avail. They see him as 'worked up,' about 'nothing.'Have they ever witnessed weather that might threaten their lives? No. Thus, they continue with their daily, mundane routines. While the protagonist mortgages his home to revamp an underground shelter in his backyard......to his wife's...horror.With an entire town - even his family seemingly against him - he begins to doubt his very sanity. Has he inherited the same mental issue that claimed the functional sanity of his mother? He wonders.Thus, here is the essential conflict, driving this tale:Can the protagonist trust his vivid imagination, his gut-level feelings, his intuition? Ah yes; he does have a bit of 'physical evidence,' in the form of strange bird formations in the sky, and odd 'sludge' coming down during rainfalls. Yet are these, in addition to his visions, enough, for him to trust himself, over others?

1515577,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B006HGXGWU,J from NY,"[45, 48]","Jeff Nichols and Michael Shannon have accomplished a portrait of paranoid schizophrenia which is the most accurate (to those who have known these sufferers) to date with the exception of a far bleaker film:Clean, Shaven (The Criterion Collection).The difference here is that Nichols wants to show how deeply linked the hallucinations, dreams and daily disturbances of a schizophrenic are to daily reality, in particular to our global feeling that the next shoe might drop at any time.  If anyone watching imagines that Curtis' behavior is unrealistic or that Shannon's natural ability to be eccentric and frightening are exaggerations of what these people (and their loved ones) go through, think again.  Having worked with the homeless/mentally ill (unfortunately a lot of men and women like Curtis simply fall through the cracks) I have always made it a policy to keep apocalyptic material AWAY from them.  The miracle Nichols pulls off here is to reflect so expertly what happens when these symptoms first start developing through Curtis' mind.A blue collar construction worker and generally an average man (Officer Van Alden fromBoardwalk Empire: The Complete First Seasonis absent here)  Curtis has a wonderful wife (Jessica Chastain who resembles Mia Farrow to an almost disturbing degree) and a sweet little girl who is handicapped (Tova Stewart).  His buddy on the construction site (Shea Wigham)is the first one to really notice that something's just not right with our man.  As the result of exactly one simple rainstorm, Curtis begins to develop brief but very potent hallucinations involving thunder, rain, and his dog.  Since thunder can make certain canines so scared they turn vicious I'm pretty sure Nichols is not setting Curtis up as a prophet proper.  He is trying to communicate the subtle and explosive panic developing in Curtis' mind.The first move that lets you know this guy is hurting is when he makes a financially risky move on a tight budget, taking out a home improvement loan for an old tornado shelter.  He puts his dog in a wire rimmed fence in the backyard though he's done nothing to deserve this punishment.He then begins to stock up food, has his buddy help him steal equipment from work to dig a bigger tunnel in his yard, and gets laid off.  His explosion at the Community Benefit Dinner is the most representative of the character's struggle, screaming about a storm that is coming with the zeal of a Pentecostal preacher from the work of Flannery O' Connor.  The misery that mental illness of this kind inflicts on families is reflected almost perfectly here.  His wife makes ends meet only after realizing her husband is disturbed.The ending is what people are arguing about.  It really could be anything--a shared subjective vision, a hallucination Curtis has when he is asleep and about to leave for the beach on the doctor's orders.  I think Nichols was borrowing fromThe Last Wave (The Criterion Collection)and a quote in that film: ""A dream is the shadow of something real.""This deserves the attention it's getting because it puts into mainstream view what severely mentally disturbed people suffer everyday.  Not everyone can afford doctors, medication, and not all these stories have a happy ending.  The best movie I've seen concerning this subject along withBug (Special Edition)andClean, Shaven (The Criterion Collection).",5,Masterpiece,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,3374,"['Jeff', 'Nichols', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'have', 'accomplished', 'portrait', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'most', 'accurate', 'who', 'have', 'known', 'sufferers', 'date', 'exception', 'far', 'bleaker', 'film', 'Clean', 'Shaven', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '.The', 'difference', 'here', 'Nichols', 'show', 'how', 'deeply', 'linked', 'hallucinations', 'dreams', 'daily', 'disturbances', 'schizophrenic', 'are', 'daily', 'reality', 'particular', 'global', 'feeling', 'next', 'shoe', 'might', 'drop', 'time', 'anyone', 'watching', 'imagines', 'Curtis', 'behavior', 'unrealistic', 'Shannon', 'natural', 'ability', 'be', 'eccentric', 'frightening', 'are', 'exaggerations', 'what', 'people', 'loved', 'ones', 'go', 'think', 'again', 'Having', 'worked', 'homeless/mentally', 'ill', 'unfortunately', 'lot', 'men', 'women', 'Curtis', 'simply', 'fall', 'cracks', 'have', 'always', 'made', 'policy', 'keep', 'apocalyptic', 'material', 'AWAY', 'miracle', 'Nichols', 'here', 'reflect', 'so', 'expertly', 'what', 'when', 'symptoms', 'first', 'start', 'developing', 'Curtis', 'mind.A', 'collar', 'construction', 'worker', 'generally', 'average', 'man', 'Officer', 'Van', 'Alden', 'fromBoardwalk', 'Empire', 'Complete', 'First', 'Seasonis', 'absent', 'here', 'Curtis', 'wonderful', 'wife', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'who', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'almost', 'disturbing', 'degree', 'sweet', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'handicapped', 'Tova', 'Stewart', 'buddy', 'construction', 'site', 'Shea', 'Wigham', 'first', 'one', 'really', 'notice', 'something', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'man', 'result', 'exactly', 'one', 'simple', 'rainstorm', 'Curtis', 'develop', 'brief', 'very', 'potent', 'hallucinations', 'involving', 'thunder', 'rain', 'dog', 'thunder', 'can', 'make', 'certain', 'canines', 'so', 'scared', 'turn', 'vicious', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Nichols', 'not', 'setting', 'Curtis', 'up', 'prophet', 'proper', 'trying', 'communicate', 'subtle', 'explosive', 'panic', 'developing', 'Curtis', 'mind.The', 'first', 'move', 'know', 'guy', 'hurting', 'when', 'financially', 'risky', 'move', 'tight', 'budget', 'taking', 'out', 'home', 'improvement', 'loan', 'old', 'tornado', 'shelter', 'dog', 'wire', 'rimmed', 'fence', 'backyard', 'done', 'nothing', 'deserve', 'punishment.He', 'then', 'stock', 'up', 'food', 'buddy', 'help', 'steal', 'equipment', 'work', 'dig', 'bigger', 'tunnel', 'yard', 'laid', 'off', 'explosion', 'Community', 'Benefit', 'Dinner', 'most', 'representative', 'character', 'struggle', 'screaming', 'storm', 'coming', 'zeal', 'Pentecostal', 'preacher', 'work', 'Flannery', 'O', 'Connor', 'misery', 'mental', 'illness', 'kind', 'families', 'reflected', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'here', 'wife', 'meet', 'only', 'realizing', 'husband', 'disturbed.The', 'ending', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'arguing', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'anything', 'shared', 'subjective', 'vision', 'hallucination', 'Curtis', 'when', 'asleep', 'leave', 'beach', 'doctor', 'orders', 'think', 'Nichols', 'was', 'borrowing', 'fromThe', 'Last', 'Wave', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'quote', 'film', 'dream', 'shadow', 'something', 'real', 'attention', 'getting', 'mainstream', 'view', 'what', 'severely', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'people', 'suffer', 'everyday', 'Not', 'everyone', 'can', 'afford', 'doctors', 'medication', 'not', 'stories', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'concerning', 'subject', 'withBug', 'Special', 'Edition', 'andClean', 'Shaven', 'Criterion', 'Collection']",Take Shelter

After several disturbing nightmares and hallucinations about severe weather, Curtis, who lives in a suburban area and works at a blue collar job, decides to renovate his storm shelter. But even while doing this, he doubts his own sanity (his mother was institutionalized for schizophrenia many years ago), and visits a counselor. His wife and brother and co-workers become very concerned about him, but he can't be dissuaded.The plot moves along at a slow pace with some intense emotional scenes well acted by Michael Shannon as Curtis and Jessica Chastain as his wife. A sense of doom pervades the plot, as you fear that Curtis' irrational actions are going to spiral into madness and ruin his family life and marriage. And he can't seem to stop it. After he builds the storm shelter, there is a storm warning and they spend the night in the shelter, but it's not a major storm. The family eventually takes their summer vacation at a beach house at the urging of a psychiatrist that Curtis visits, and all seems normal until the final scenes of the movie.

He builds a storm shelter as a precautionary measure while trying to hide his visions. But, is it all in his head or is the apocalypse coming? Take Shelter is an immersive and entertaining psychological drama.I really enjoyed the story in Take Shelter. The story plays like a psychological drama where Curtis continues to question his sanity, and so does the rest of the town. His visions, both conscious and unconscious, are vivid and realistic adding a pinch of mystery and suspense; it may not end the way you expect it. On that note, the end is magnificent (whether you look at it literally or metaphorically), especially the accompanying music. It's heavily supported by Michael Shannon's superb performance, as well as the all-around magnificent supporting cast. It's tightly directed and written by Jeff Nichols. The cinematography is exceptional at times. The music blends seamlessly with the film and adds to the immersion.The blu-ray of the film is of truly superb quality. The picture and audio quality are exceptional, and the special features are worth your time.

Their emotion is, for the most part, understated (except for a few very emotional scenes by Chastain as the wife), which is what makes the film so interesting to watch. You can see the internal conflicts deepen in Shannon through his facial expressions, not in explosions of behavior.What I like most is that the family decides to deal with what they think is psychotic behavior on the father's part, in a very loving manner. They stick together to try to make things work even though it seems at times that the father is totally off his rocker.I was okay that the ending is not very climactic because it was resolved in the same way as the rest of the film - with an understated sense of urgency and doom.This movie could have easily gotten religious or just plain stupid, but it did neither of these. The director kept the movie visually appealing while developing the characters just enough to create a slow burn of tension and interest. Though I've read some reviews that imply the daughter, who is deaf, is a symbol of the community, which refuses to believe the father's visions, I took her to be more of an extension of the father's character. He seems ""normal"" in most regards, but his dreams and ensuing behavior lead him to be an outcast in many ways.

Michael Shannon's character spends most of the movie with the ""deer caught in the headlights"" look after having several ""prophetic"" type dreams about a storm and several other terrifying events.  His bizarre behavior is forgivable under the circumstances but it takes nearly the entire movie before he can share his dreams with his family who has now gone through numerous ordeals because of him and his torment. But the worst is the end.  A bad storm finally comes and the he and his family spend the night in the storm shelter that he built at the cost of his home and his job.  However, the next morning arrives and after a strong bit of encouragement from his wife he opens the door only to find the storm did little damage at all.  Shannon's character then heads the advice of a doctor and leaves town for a while to unwind. The final scene has the family at a beach in South Carolina having a nice time when they all notice a terrible storm coming off the ocean.  The movie then ends abruptly.

1515598,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B006HGXGWU,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","""Take Shelter"" is a very current film, taking themes of extreme weather and applying them to life in a rural Ohio town. One of the reason's I liked this movie so much was its ability to comment on a controversial topic (global warming/natural disasters/extreme weather) without directly referencing this debate once. It is obviously there in mental undertones; the way this is done is extremely clever in the combination of seemingly irrational fear and one man's attempt to control the environment around him.Michael Shannon plays the lead as Curtis LaForche, a father and husband who has a pretty typical life. He is the parent of a young deaf daughter, but this doesn't have a devastating effect on his family. It does have an added burden though, to a young couple who struggle with health issues. Besides the topic of extreme weather, this film's secondardy theme is mental health. Shannon does one of the best  wierded out characters, so much so that he even seems to be type cast to a certain extent. His role of Nelson Van Alden, the fallen Prohibition Agent in HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" is not a far cry from this preformance. Both characters have a similar pent up emotional state which proves to be problematic and explosive.The two topics which collide head on in this film create quite a climax. The writing makes it very current, given the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and just recently with Sandy hitting New York and New Jersey. Considering this movie takes place in the midwestern heartland, it also gives the viewer an idea of the fear they go through every tornado season, with the thought in the back of their mind that the next big storm could take everything. With Laforche, this fear surfaces in a few different ways, and Shannon really thrives in acting out this instability, which builds until the final scene.It's one of the best suspense flicks I've seen in a long time. Many movies which rely on a punchy ending fall short of the mark unless the conclusion really rises above and resolves the problems which beset the characters throughout the whole picture. Director Jeff Nichols recieved recognition for this effort at the Cannes Film Festival, and after the big finale I can see why. The mix of acting, CGI and clever directing (as well as a great soundtrack) puts this story on the borderlands between insanity and fear.",4,Riveting natural disaster film,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,2371,"['Take', 'Shelter', 'very', 'current', 'film', 'taking', 'themes', 'extreme', 'weather', 'applying', 'life', 'rural', 'Ohio', 'town', 'One', 'reason', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'ability', 'comment', 'controversial', 'topic', 'global', 'warming/natural', 'disasters/extreme', 'weather', 'directly', 'referencing', 'debate', 'once', 'obviously', 'mental', 'undertones', 'way', 'done', 'extremely', 'clever', 'combination', 'seemingly', 'irrational', 'fear', 'one', 'man', 'attempt', 'control', 'environment', 'him.Michael', 'Shannon', 'lead', 'Curtis', 'LaForche', 'father', 'husband', 'who', 'pretty', 'typical', 'life', 'parent', 'young', 'deaf', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'have', 'devastating', 'effect', 'family', 'have', 'added', 'burden', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'struggle', 'health', 'issues', 'topic', 'extreme', 'weather', 'film', 'secondardy', 'theme', 'mental', 'health', 'Shannon', 'one', 'best', 'wierded', 'out', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'be', 'type', 'cast', 'certain', 'extent', 'role', 'Nelson', 'Van', 'Alden', 'fallen', 'Prohibition', 'Agent', 'HBO', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'not', 'far', 'cry', 'preformance', 'characters', 'have', 'similar', 'pent', 'up', 'emotional', 'state', 'be', 'problematic', 'explosive.The', 'two', 'topics', 'collide', 'head', 'film', 'create', 'quite', 'climax', 'writing', 'very', 'current', 'given', 'devastation', 'caused', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', '2005', 'just', 'recently', 'Sandy', 'hitting', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Considering', 'movie', 'place', 'midwestern', 'heartland', 'also', 'viewer', 'idea', 'fear', 'go', 'tornado', 'season', 'thought', 'back', 'mind', 'next', 'big', 'storm', 'could', 'take', 'everything', 'Laforche', 'fear', 'few', 'different', 'ways', 'Shannon', 'really', 'acting', 'out', 'instability', 'final', 'scene.It', 'one', 'best', 'suspense', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Many', 'movies', 'rely', 'punchy', 'ending', 'fall', 'short', 'mark', 'conclusion', 'really', 'problems', 'beset', 'characters', 'whole', 'picture', 'Director', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', 'recieved', 'recognition', 'effort', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'big', 'finale', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'mix', 'acting', 'CGI', 'clever', 'directing', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'borderlands', 'insanity', 'fear']",Take Shelter

When Curtis begins having nightmares and hallucinations of a coming apocalyptic storm, he not only builds an expensive storm shelter in his back yard, much to the concern of his family, friends and employer, who eventually fires him, but he also begins to doubt his own sanity, since he mother had fallen victim to schizophrenia years before.Nichols endows his story with a deliberate pace that allows viewers to take the journey with Curtis as, on the one hand, he succumbs to his unnerving ""visions"" by building the expanded storm shelter while, on the other, exploring the looming possibility that he is, indeed, losing his sanity like his mother (Kathy Baker) did when she was his age.At times, the slow pacing works against the film, which would probably have been more effective than it is already, were it trimmed by twenty minutes.I don't care how ""great"" an individual scene or moment might be.  If the information it conveys is redundant and it slows the overall tempo of the film, then it should go.  That's why ""God"" created ""Deleted Scenes"" sections on DVDs.Nevertheless, TAKE SHELTER is a fine film with an ending that will definitely have viewers pondering long after the picture has ended.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains informative and interesting audio commentary by writer/director Jeff Nichols and star Michael Shannon.There are also two deleted scenes, a 10-minute ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette and a 20-minute Q&A; with Shannon and co-star Shea Whigham.

That's what keeps me from having a totally satisfactory experience.I certainly can't fault the actors.

The ubiquitous Jessica Chastain adds another star in her growing career as the wife who takes her vows seriously.

It's the story of Curtis (Michael Shannon), a road construction worker who lives in a small northern Ohio town with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and their small, hearing-impaired daughter Hannah. Curtis and Samantha live a quiet, outwardly contented life, and between their savings and Curtis' health insurance they plan soon to get Hannah the operation that will allow her to hear.But soon Curtis is beset with visions and nightmares. Rain the color and texture of motor oil falls from the sky; his beloved old dog attacks him viciously; strange creatures menace him and Hannah; birds fly in spiraling, evil-looking flocks, then suddenly fall dead to the ground. Slowly Curtis becomes convinced these nightmares are premonitory of a cataclysmic tornado. He starts borrowing equipment from work and spending his family's savings to build a state-of-the-art tornado shelter in his yard, infuriating Samantha and alienating his friends in the process.Even Curtis is aware that his visions might be the sign of an unbalanced mind; his mother (Kathy Baker) was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic when she was about the age he is now. But talking to his mother provides no answers, and neither do the pathetically bare-bones mental health services available in his town.This is Nichols' second feature. His first--""Shotgun Stories,"" which also starred Shannon--had many fine things in it but suffered from too many lingering landscape shots. In ""Take Shelter,"" however, the flat, foreboding Ohio landscape is virtually a character, and the ever-more-threatening storm clouds Curtis sees on the horizon add immeasurably to the building suspense. Nichols' screenplay is airtight, and the performances could not be bettered. Shannon, with his craggy, haunted face. delivers an unforgettable performance, and Chastain--who is having a miracle year as an actress--stands shoulder-to-shoulder with him.The story culminates in a horrifying yet touching scene that intertwines the twin plot threads of weather-borne terror and family love. However, Nichols adds a coda to the story that I'm still trying to make up my mind about. That coda could be interpreted as vindication, as parable, or as a plain sick joke. No matter.

The climax is not its strongest feature, but it does generate suspense. Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon) lives in a small Ohio town with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and 6-year-old daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart), who is deaf. Curtis works for a sand-mining company, while Samantha stays home with their daughter and sells her handiworks at a flea market on weekends. This affords them a modest home with a big yard and view of the countryside. But Curtis has begun to have disturbing dreams. They always involve a big storm, followed by violence. He becomes preoccupied with refurbishing an old tornado shelter in his back yard. Then he begins to hear and see storms that aren't there while awake. Curtis wonders if he is showing signs of the schizophrenia that afflicted his mother, or having premonitions of an impending disaster.Jeff Nichols wrote and directed ""Take Shelter"", inspired by a sense of global anxiety, unease about the future, engendered by the financial crisis. Curtis LaForche is an introverted man of few words who feels strongly the need to protect his family -but from what he is not certain. Michael Shannon does a nice job of showing us Curtis' inner torment, created by his conflicting compulsions to build the storm shelter, to hide his troubles from those around him, and to find out if he might be mentally ill. Wife Samantha is as understanding as she can be and impressively sane once she understands her husband's fears. I admire the complexity and integrity of those two characters. Daughter Hannah, however, would be more frightened by her parents' volatile behavior that she is. But I enjoyed the characters and the uncertainty surrounding Curtis' visions.

They do have a 6 or 7 year old daughter who is deaf which creates challenges, but they seem able to cope and they are happy.  Then Curtis begins having horrible nightmares about a coming apocalypse.  At first he tries to ignore it, although sometimes even the physical effects persist.  While his wife and fellow workers notice differences in his behavior, Curtis brushes it off before eventually getting help.  His mother (Kathy Baker) was institutionalized years earlier for schizophrenia, so he believes he may also be a victim.The pressure of the delusions causes him to focus on expanding an old storm cellar as he foresees the coming storm.  As Curtis sinks deeper and deeper into what most believe is mental illness, Shannon's performance is remarkable and believable reminding me of another movie from 2011 involving another form of psychosis, ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" with Elizabeth Olsen.  The year also gave us a couple other movies in terms of similar theme.  For unusual sci-fi with strange behavior check out ""Melancholia"" and ""Another Earth.""Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, the movie does seem to take an awfully long time to get from point A to B, which sometimes adds to the suspense but sometimes is just confounding.

Nevertheless, difficult times, misunderstood encounters, and failures to make sense of the senseless take a toll on decent individuals and wholesome relationships.  Finding explanations for the inexplicable is nerve-wracking and can be pushed to maddening extremes.Take Shelter hints at a variety of narratives, but viewers who like things neat and tidy will probably be disappointed.  However, those who find interest in low-keyed characterization and the emotional pull of a cinematic context that is both plainly ordinary and decidedly off-beat will find this film rewarding.  I belong to the group that gives priority to a clearly defined narrative, but after giving it some thought, I'm glad I watched Take Shelter.

Don't miss writer/director Jeff Nichols' timely and disturbing meditation about the growing, apparent madness of Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon), a good, heartland American husband and father trying to cope with family issues - his six year old daughter is deaf and needs surgery - escalating financial problems and private, apocalyptic nightmares.There's a pervasive malevolence in this mostly quiet melodrama that becomes increasingly unsettling as the dreams become more frequent and vivid; so much so that they cause Curtis to secretly borrow money to build a new storm shelter in their yard.  When Curtis confides his horrifying night-visions to his loving wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) is not happy with this turn of events and recognizes that her husband may need professional help.  And then he loses his job.  But the dreams persist.Michael Shannon is astonishing as Curtis LaForche.  And Jessica Chastain shows her growing bewilderment, anger and anxiety in her yes and body language even when there are no spoken words.  Shannon and Chastain are exceptional as the concerned couple.  There's never a false moment.  The special effects are organic and extremely effective.This amazingly well-crafted story and film taps into our collective concerns about our fragile, shared reality.  Alfred Hitchcock and Roman Polanski mastered this particular filmic sense of shaping and focusing a feeling of nameless dread into an ever-sharper series of events that go further than our fears.  Movies are dreams made real, and like INCEPTION, this one delivers a layered drama of fractured reality and madness actualized.  Are we what we secretly perceive? Or fear?

1515630,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B006HGXGWU,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","****1/2Curtis LaForche keeps staring up at the sky.  Whether it's a bank of menacing storm clouds or a flock of birds flying in a strange formation he`s looking at, this Ohio construction worker is developing the unnerving sense that something is just not quite right with the world, and that Doom may be just over the horizon. It doesn't help that he's being plagued by a rash of dreams that seem to be reinforcing that conviction.  Before you know it, he's building an elaborate underground shelter and stocking it with emergency supplies - bankrupting the family and alienating those closest to him in the process.  Throughout, the movie forces us to keep asking the question: is he mentally ill or is there really something to this feeling?  Is he perhaps some modern-day Cassandra, cursed with the awareness of impending disaster but powerless to do anything to prevent it?Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, ""Take Shelter"" is a horror story told with all the quiet spareness of an apocalyptic parable.  The rural setting works for two seemingly contradictory reasons.  It brings a sense of foreboding to a small-town environment where threats to safety seem few and far between.  Yet, at the same time, the stark flatness of the Midwestern plane can make one feel immensely vulnerable against the powerful forces of nature - be it crackling thunderstorms, destructive tornadoes or just an endless sky filled with towering cloud formations that dwarf anything on the earth`s surface.What separates ""Taking Shelter"" from so many other films on the subject of mental illness is that Curtis (the stunning Michael Shannon) is not content to suffer in silence, but rather takes proactive steps to figure out what might be wrong with him on a medical level and to search for solutions.  It helps that his mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when she was in her 30s, and so he figures he may be exhibiting symptoms of the same illness.The movie also explores the more mundane reality of working-class folk being just one paycheck away from poverty and loss of health care insurance.  That is the REAL doomsday scenario.On the surface, the film harkens back to those earlier days of atom-bomb scares, then brings it into the present with our current obsession with terrorist attacks.On a deeper level, it's about the Sword of Damacles - that unspecified object of dread - that dangles over our heads at every moment of our lives but which we choose to ignore as the only possible way of getting through life.  But Curtis, for whatever reason, is being forced to acknowledge its existence and the ever-present threat it poses to him and his family.  Our modern life has become so safety-bound and sanitized that we tend to forget that, through our entire history as a species, we've been confronted with daily threats to survival.  And Curtis seems to have somehow reconnected to that truth.  Yet, paradoxically, we've also become a people who magnify threats beyond their actual magnitude of probability (terrorism being just one example).The irony is that by focusing so intently on the apocalypse that may or may never come, Curtis is endangering those close to him in far more mundane ways: bankrupting the family, jeopardizing his job, alienating his friends and co-workers, and driving a wedge between himself and his understandably concerned wife (Jessica Chastain) and deaf little daughter (Tova Stewart) with his bizarre and frightening behavior.Featuring a flawless tour-de-force performance by Shannon, ""Take Shelter"" is a subtle, thoughtful and unnerving film that gets under one's skin - as any fine horror movie should.",4,Quietly unnerving look into paranoia,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,3644,"['****1/2Curtis', 'LaForche', 'staring', 'up', 'sky', 'bank', 'menacing', 'storm', 'clouds', 'flock', 'birds', 'flying', 'strange', 'formation', 's', 'looking', 'Ohio', 'construction', 'worker', 'developing', 'unnerving', 'sense', 'something', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'world', 'Doom', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'horizon', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'plagued', 'rash', 'dreams', 'seem', 'be', 'reinforcing', 'conviction', 'know', 'building', 'elaborate', 'underground', 'shelter', 'stocking', 'emergency', 'supplies', 'bankrupting', 'family', 'alienating', 'closest', 'process', 'Throughout', 'movie', 'keep', 'asking', 'question', 'mentally', 'ill', 'really', 'something', 'feeling', 'perhaps', 'modern-day', 'Cassandra', 'cursed', 'awareness', 'impending', 'disaster', 'powerless', 'do', 'anything', 'prevent', 'Written', 'directed', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'horror', 'story', 'told', 'quiet', 'spareness', 'apocalyptic', 'parable', 'rural', 'setting', 'works', 'two', 'seemingly', 'contradictory', 'reasons', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'small-town', 'environment', 'where', 'threats', 'safety', 'seem', 'few', 'far', 'same', 'time', 'stark', 'flatness', 'Midwestern', 'plane', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'feel', 'immensely', 'vulnerable', 'powerful', 'forces', 'nature', 'be', 'crackling', 'thunderstorms', 'destructive', 'tornadoes', 'just', 'endless', 'sky', 'filled', 'towering', 'cloud', 'formations', 'dwarf', 'anything', 'earth', 's', 'surface.What', 'Taking', 'Shelter', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'subject', 'mental', 'illness', 'Curtis', 'stunning', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'not', 'content', 'suffer', 'silence', 'rather', 'proactive', 'steps', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'wrong', 'medical', 'level', 'search', 'solutions', 'mother', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'when', 'was', '30s', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'exhibiting', 'symptoms', 'same', 'illness.The', 'movie', 'also', 'more', 'mundane', 'reality', 'working-class', 'folk', 'being', 'just', 'one', 'paycheck', 'away', 'poverty', 'loss', 'health', 'care', 'insurance', 'REAL', 'doomsday', 'scenario.On', 'surface', 'film', 'back', 'earlier', 'days', 'atom-bomb', 'scares', 'then', 'present', 'current', 'obsession', 'terrorist', 'attacks.On', 'deeper', 'level', 'Sword', 'Damacles', 'unspecified', 'object', 'dread', 'heads', 'moment', 'lives', 'choose', 'ignore', 'only', 'possible', 'way', 'getting', 'life', 'Curtis', 'reason', 'being', 'forced', 'acknowledge', 'existence', 'ever-present', 'threat', 'family', 'modern', 'life', 'become', 'so', 'safety-bound', 'sanitized', 'tend', 'forget', 'entire', 'history', 'species', ""'ve"", 'been', 'confronted', 'daily', 'threats', 'survival', 'Curtis', 'have', 'somehow', 'reconnected', 'truth', 'paradoxically', ""'ve"", 'also', 'become', 'people', 'who', 'magnify', 'threats', 'actual', 'magnitude', 'probability', 'terrorism', 'being', 'just', 'one', 'example', '.The', 'irony', 'focusing', 'so', 'intently', 'apocalypse', 'may', 'may', 'never', 'come', 'Curtis', 'endangering', 'close', 'far', 'more', 'mundane', 'ways', 'bankrupting', 'family', 'jeopardizing', 'job', 'alienating', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'driving', 'wedge', 'understandably', 'concerned', 'wife', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'deaf', 'little', 'daughter', 'Tova', 'Stewart', 'bizarre', 'frightening', 'behavior.Featuring', 'flawless', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'Shannon', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'subtle', 'thoughtful', 'unnerving', 'film', 'one', 'skin', 'fine', 'horror', 'movie', 'should']",Take Shelter

I felt he'd played this role of a schizophrenic with an increasingly dangerous obsession before - and before. ""Take Shelter"" looks like an alternate version of the movie ""Bug""Bug (Special Edition)in which he starred - only instead of bodily infestation, here he becomes consumed with worry over the likelihood of a coming Armageddon of storms. This movie also looks like an alternate version of ""My Son, My Son, What Have Ye' Done?""My Son, My Son - What Have Ye' Done?in which he plays a troubled man who's increasingly losing touch with reality as a racking drama of voices and obsessions plays out in his head.Shannon does disturbance extraordinarily well. But I began to fade from this film, as I became convinced I'd seen it all before. The principal thing that held my interest was the photography. The shots of ominous gatherings of clouds and birds and Shannon's darkening horizon are arresting.But wait. This movie does take a turn into some wholly different implications. Its novelty comes so late in the movie though, many habitual movie-goers might not hang in there to see it. They might leave with the impression this in another Shannon progression into madness.If you haven't seen ""Bug"" or ""My Son, My Son,"" you can appreciate this film as a singular tour de force performance by Shannon.

Suffice it to say, the full meaning of Take Shelter rests perilously upon the final scene, where the primary issue of the film--the sanity of the protagonist--is seemingly resolved. A straight-forward reading of that scene yields a richness of social implication; allegorical or ironic readings yield nothing but the fruit of a well-acted psycho-suspense thriller.Appearances aside, this is not a film about the private affairs of a married couple, and this is not a film that ends on a note of discontinuity. The whole point of the film is that the line between private anguish and public life is an illusion; the whole point of the ending is that it is the logical outcome of a psychological process that has been building up for two hours on screen.As far as I'm concerned, Take Shelter is about the challenge of people coming together in the face of an impending political catastrophe, about forging a meeting-of-minds that requires nothing less than extraordinary courage and empathy from all of us, as we strive to overcome the all-but-unbridgeable gaps between our various subjective experiences of the world. In this sense, the super-natural elements in Take Shelter appear only superficially in the sky; the real miracle is in what happens between two human beings--married or unmarried, it makes no difference--by the end of the film.In my view, Take Shelter is far and away the most important political film of this young century.",5,It's impossible to avoid talking about the ending of this movie,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,1479,"[""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'play', 'spoiler', 'Suffice', 'say', 'full', 'meaning', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'perilously', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'primary', 'issue', 'film', 'sanity', 'protagonist', 'seemingly', 'resolved', 'straight-forward', 'reading', 'scene', 'richness', 'social', 'implication', 'allegorical', 'ironic', 'readings', 'yield', 'nothing', 'fruit', 'well-acted', 'psycho-suspense', 'thriller.Appearances', 'aside', 'not', 'film', 'private', 'affairs', 'married', 'couple', 'not', 'film', 'note', 'discontinuity', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'line', 'private', 'anguish', 'public', 'life', 'illusion', 'whole', 'point', 'ending', 'logical', 'outcome', 'psychological', 'process', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'two', 'hours', 'screen.As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'challenge', 'people', 'coming', 'together', 'face', 'impending', 'political', 'catastrophe', 'forging', 'meeting-of-minds', 'nothing', 'less', 'extraordinary', 'courage', 'empathy', 'strive', 'overcome', 'all-but-unbridgeable', 'gaps', 'various', 'subjective', 'experiences', 'world', 'sense', 'super-natural', 'elements', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'appear', 'only', 'superficially', 'sky', 'real', 'miracle', 'what', 'two', 'human', 'beings', 'married', 'unmarried', 'difference', 'end', 'film.In', 'view', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'far', 'away', 'most', 'important', 'political', 'film', 'young', 'century']",Take Shelter

1515637,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B006HGXGWU,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[5, 5]","Jeff Nichols' new film, ""Take Shelter"" is a marvelous example of what happens when a group of talented people come together to tell a smart story and make a good film, despite the fact that few will see it and even fewer will appreciate it. I already know not everyone likes this movie, there are other comments right here that in no uncertain terms say so, some even yell so, this is, of course, because the movie is something of a challenge for many viewers. It plays out as a mystery, we've already lost many people here brought up on Hollywood effects driven blockbusters that explains it all in the trailers, a psychological drama and a character study, it is what is missing so often today at the multiplex or new on Netflix, an adult thriller aimed at a willing audience.Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, a relative newcomer with only one other film under his belt,Shotgun Storieswhich played at Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival a few years back, Nichols writes a compelling script that translates into a gripping movie where things may not be what they seem, or as we the audience begin to care, we fear that they are what they seem and we don't like what we see. This works largely because of the fine acting of Michael Shannon, a great actor giving one of his greatest performances as the central character, Curtis. Curtis is a working class midwesterner who as the movie begins is plagued by a continuing series of nightmares about a coming near apocalyptic storm. Jessica Chastain is equally good, just how many good performances did she give in 2011, as Samantha, Curtis' loving wife, she gives the character the proper empathy to emote reactions from the viewer, we can see through her that sometimes being the witness can be the harder thing to have to be.The only major flaw I can find with the movie is that it is perhaps drawn out a little bit too much. There are those who will, and do find the leisurely way the film unfolds to be boring, I think a lot of these people are too caught up in the modern era of instant gratification. When one is brought up on video games and movies based on such or easily transformed to the medium, expecting patience is difficult, if not all together futile. However, I do think that a small amount of tightening up in the center of the film might have made it's flow a little more gripping.The ending is the kind that I normally hate in a movie like this, it is ambiguous, I don't have a problem with ambiguity, but the way it is played sometimes can test a viewer's tolerance. Here though, I don't believe that to be the case. The ending seems to me to be the exact right conclusion, and it knows when to stop. I had a strong emotional reaction to this film, in no small part due to the near brilliance of the movie's final ten minutes or so.For the right audience, this is one of the best films of 2011. It is also the best thriller in a long time, period. I hope beyond all hope it finds a good audience, critical reaction has been up to this point, mostly favorable. In fact, many were surprised by Shannon's omission from the Oscar race. I say see it and I look forward to future films from this talent new filmmaker.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",5,I can smell the rain,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,3231,"['Jeff', 'Nichols', 'new', 'film', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'marvelous', 'example', 'what', 'when', 'group', 'talented', 'people', 'come', 'together', 'tell', 'smart', 'story', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'fact', 'few', 'will', 'see', 'even', 'fewer', 'will', 'appreciate', 'already', 'know', 'not', 'everyone', 'movie', 'are', 'other', 'comments', 'right', 'here', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'say', 'so', 'even', 'yell', 'so', 'course', 'movie', 'something', 'challenge', 'many', 'viewers', 'out', 'mystery', ""'ve"", 'already', 'lost', 'many', 'people', 'here', 'brought', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'effects', 'driven', 'blockbusters', 'trailers', 'psychological', 'drama', 'character', 'study', 'what', 'missing', 'so', 'often', 'today', 'multiplex', 'new', 'Netflix', 'adult', 'thriller', 'aimed', 'willing', 'audience.Written', 'directed', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'belt', 'Shotgun', 'Storieswhich', 'played', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Overlooked', 'Film', 'Festival', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Nichols', 'compelling', 'script', 'gripping', 'movie', 'where', 'things', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'seem', 'audience', 'begin', 'care', 'fear', 'are', 'what', 'seem', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'see', 'largely', 'fine', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'great', 'actor', 'giving', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'central', 'character', 'Curtis', 'Curtis', 'working', 'class', 'midwesterner', 'who', 'movie', 'plagued', 'continuing', 'series', 'nightmares', 'coming', 'apocalyptic', 'storm', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'equally', 'good', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'good', 'performances', 'did', 'give', '2011', 'Samantha', 'Curtis', 'loving', 'wife', 'character', 'proper', 'empathy', 'emote', 'reactions', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'sometimes', 'being', 'witness', 'can', 'be', 'harder', 'thing', 'have', 'be.The', 'only', 'major', 'flaw', 'can', 'find', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'drawn', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'find', 'leisurely', 'way', 'film', 'unfolds', 'be', 'boring', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'modern', 'era', 'instant', 'gratification', 'When', 'one', 'brought', 'up', 'video', 'games', 'movies', 'based', 'such', 'easily', 'transformed', 'medium', 'expecting', 'patience', 'difficult', 'not', 'together', 'futile', 'However', 'do', 'think', 'small', 'amount', 'tightening', 'up', 'center', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'flow', 'little', 'more', 'gripping.The', 'ending', 'kind', 'normally', 'hate', 'movie', 'ambiguous', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'ambiguity', 'way', 'played', 'sometimes', 'can', 'test', 'viewer', 'tolerance', 'Here', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'be', 'case', 'ending', 'be', 'exact', 'right', 'conclusion', 'when', 'stop', 'had', 'strong', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'film', 'small', 'part', 'due', 'near', 'brilliance', 'movie', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so.For', 'right', 'audience', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2011', 'also', 'best', 'thriller', 'long', 'time', 'period', 'hope', 'hope', 'good', 'audience', 'critical', 'reaction', 'been', 'up', 'point', 'mostly', 'favorable', 'fact', 'many', 'were', 'surprised', 'Shannon', 'omission', 'Oscar', 'race', 'say', 'see', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'films', 'talent', 'new', 'filmmaker.Check', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",Take Shelter

In his dreams, his wife and young daughter are in terrible danger. The film sometimes blurs the line between fantasy and reality and we see events unfold that are later revealed as dreams. His dog bites him in one such event and unidentified strangers attack him and his daughter in another episode.We all have nightmares, but Curtis experiences more than just dreams. He also hears the storm approaching. While he is working outside with his colleague, Dewart (Shea Whigham), Curtis hears a thunderbolt strike. Dewart doesn't hear a thing.Do you trust what you see and hear without question? What would you think if you could hear things that nobody else could?If what Curtis experiences is really happening, how is that possible? Is it some form of intervention from God? It is some kind of psychic ability? Is the subconscious mind revealing what Curtis knows on some level?To complicate matters, Curtis was left alone outside a store as a child when his mother had a mental breakdown and just walked away. He visits her in a nursing home because he fears that he might be going down the same path. It's such a realistic possibility that we are drawn into his world. Is he going crazy? He seems rational most of the time, but then he experiences another dream or hallucination.His wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), is more than patient. We get the feeling that their relationship is strong and she clearly loves him. In a good relationship, it should be possible to talk openly about such problems, but Curtis initially hides everything from her. This is done out of fear. He's afraid of what might be happening to him and he's embarrassed about his experiences. He visits a doctor and a psychiatrist without her knowledge and even makes a serious financial decision without discussing it.Lack of communication is a huge problem in most relationships. If you are with the person you are supposed to trust more than anyone in the world, why can't you voice all of your fears? Curtis is eventually compelled to talk to Samantha because there's no other way to explain his bizarre behavior.Take Shelter shows us what occurs in the mind of a tormented man. The tension slowly builds and we can sense that something is going to happen. Is Curtis going crazy, or will all of his actions be justified? I won't reveal that here.The ending is somewhat controversial. I liked it a lot and think it was the perfect way to conclude the story. Shannon does a great job in the final scenes and there's one particular expression which speaks volumes.

Curtis,is a man whose dreams tell him what is happening,they auger a disaster about to happen.He is slowly going mad,there's evidence he has inherited his mother's mental illness,paranoid schizophrenia.He has delusions and hallucinations of end-of-days rain,tornados,strange clouds of birds,assaults,abductions,flying furniture.""Is anyone seeing this?""he asks stopping on the side of the road before a huge electrical storm.The question resonates with the crises of money and morale today.He can't communicate with his wife.He is fearful and protective of his deaf daughter.He is an upper blue-collar working man who works in gravel.He's practical,taciturn,withdrawn,strong yet vulnerable.Family and its protection is everything.Survival.The portents of stormy apocalypse are the projections of an unsettled mind.From the outside his friend Dewar says:"" You got it good"".But the film views Curtis from inside-dismantling his home,banishing the dog,alienating friends,taking out a high risk loan to extend the family's storm shelter,abusing his job and sacked for misconduct.It's only after an overdose and a seizure that he tells his wife about the dreams. When a minor storm hits, the town's air raid sirens go off and the family wisely flees to the storm shelter.

Jessica Chastain continues to impress as Shannon's long suffering wife who struggles to understand her husband's gradual decent into possible madness. While watching the film, I remembered Richard Chamberlain's lawyer in Peter Weir's film The Last Wave who also questioned his sanity while having visions of a coming apocalypse. Weir's film also does an excellent job of telegraphing impending doom but Michael Shannon's performance raises Take Shelter to another level of dread. Others have expressed some disappointment with the film's conclusion. Initially, I felt that the ending was a little too convenient but on reflection this feeling may have been caused due to the powerful buildup of images and emotions throughout the film.

1515652,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B006HGXGWU,Turfseer,"[21, 32]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Take Shelter' is a part horror, part psychological drama starring the always excellent Michael Shannon, as an Ohio construction worker who has a history of mental illness in his family, and is now plagued by disturbing visions himself. The question arises whether these visions are portents of things to come or merely the hallucinations of a man gradually experiencing a complete mental breakdown. The entire film is dependent on the big 'payoff' at the end, which turns out to be intentionally ambiguous according to writer/director Jeff Nichols, and has sparked a great deal of controversy over the internet, as to how to interpret such an ambiguous denouement.Nichols presents his story more as a parable than a drama about real life people. Most of the characters are referred to by first names only, such as Michael Shannon's 'Curtis' and his wife 'Samantha' (also well-played by Jessica Chastain). Curtis is sort of an everyman, distinguished only by the fact that his daughter, Hannah, is deaf, and that his mother is a schizophrenic, now living in an assisted living facility. Everyone in Nichols' rural Ohio community, seems to be overly grim and lacking any kind of sense of humor. What's more, there are few discussions by any of the characters that would ground them in any particular place and time.A good part of the film is taken up with depicting all of the alarming visions Curtis is experiencing. The visions run the gamut from Curtis being attacked by his dog, zombie-like people attempting to break into his house and his car while he's driving with his daughter, as well as a giant flock of birds that seemingly hone in on Curtis as a target.Curtis becomes convinced that the visions he experiences, are real, and as a result decides to build a shelter to protect his family from an oncoming apocalyptic storm. His co-worker buddy, Dewart, decides to help him as they borrow their company's heavy digging machinery without authorization and use it to construct the shelter. It's Dewart's devotion to Curtis that causes him to use poor judgment in allowing Curtis to use the machinery without permission. I found Dewart's capitulation to Curtis' request, still a bit too easy as of course such an action could place both their jobs in jeopardy. As it turns out, that's exactly what happens: Curtis is fired and Dewart is suspended for two weeks.For those who were satisfied with the machinations of Nichols' grim characters for most of the film, I can only say that everyone's concept of suspense is different. My feeling was that by the end of the film, the payoff had to be pretty darn good, since the events leading up to it were markedly slow-going, a bit repetitious and not all that absorbing. Nevertheless, I will concede that the ambiguity of the film's ending is food for thought--although ultimately, not as profound as many would like to believe.The film's ending can be interpreted in two distinct ways. The first interpretation is that Curtis' visions were real and his warnings to his community about an impending apocalypse, fell on deaf ears. The storm can be seen as the ultimate result of global warming, with Nichols criticizing those unconcerned about environmental disaster preparedness as well as a general critique on those who rely solely on rationalism as a guide through life. Ironically (with Interpretation #1), it's Samantha, Curtis' well-meaning, 'rational' wife, who gets the shock of her life when she looks out toward the horizon at the beach and sees the 'apocalypse' bearing down on her and her family. Some internet posters argue that since the storm is seen in the reflection of the beach house window (and not from Curtis' point of view which we had always seen before), this is proof that the storm is meant to be real. Interpretation #1 believers hold that when Curtis calls out to Sam at the end, and she responds, ""Ok"", that's her frozen in fear, acknowledging that she was wrong and Curtis was right all along.Interpretation #2 holds that the climax is another one of Curtis' hallucinations, albeit more benign and optimistic than those that have come before. In this interpretation, the family wouldn't have taken this trip since Curtis had lost his job and they could not afford it (Interpretation #1 believers point out that Samantha had extra money stashed away and would have used it to make the trip, as part of Curtis' ongoing rehabilitation). When Sam says ""okay"", she's accepting Curtis' continuing mental illness but is glad that the family is still together. The final scene is in contrast to an earlier one of Curtis' hallucinations, where he perceives his wife as hostile, on the verge of grabbing a knife and perhaps attacking him. Instead of Curtis as doomed seer, he's merely a victim of mental illness, whose wife has made the commitment to stay and support him as he tries to recover.I believe that writer/director Nichols threw in the 'Twilight Zone ending' (where Curtis' prophecy is realized), by directing Jessica Chastain to display a look of dread as she stares out at the impending storm. But overall, if one looks at the nature of Curtis' hallucinations (which include zombie-like creatures), I'm in the camp of Interpretation #2, which believes that Curtis is mentally ill.Most of 'Take Shelter', with its generic characters and slow-moving plot, feels derivative. Only the clever, ambiguous ending, which has sparked endless discussion, is enough to save it from total mediocrity. Nonetheless, my feeling is that this probably could have worked better as a one hour, Twilight Zone-like episode, than a full-length feature.",3,"Spooky, ambiguous ending saves slow-moving narrative

1515653,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B006HGXGWU,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[7, 8]","Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, TAKE SHELTER is a movie about a man who has terrifying visions who actually might be a prophet, but whom no one believes because modern science says it can't be so.  The film stars Michael Shannon as Curtis. Curtis has a high-paying job that includes excellent health benefits. He's married to his beautiful wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain). They have one child, a daughter named Hannah, who is deaf. Thanks to the health insurance through Curtis' job, Hannah is eligible for a cochlear implant to restore part of her hearing. At the beginning of the film, Curtis' best friend and co-worker, Dewart (Shea Whigham) tells Curtis something to the effect that he's got a great life.Then Curtis starts having nightmares. In some ways the dreams are more vivid than anything he has experienced in real life. In the dreams, he sees a storm of Apocalyptical proportions occur. People go crazy and someone is always chasing either him or his family. The dreams become more and more intense. So much so, that Curtis begins fixing up the old storm shelter in the backyard. As he does so, the dreams begin happening while he is awake and at work: he begins seeing flocks of birds and massive bolts of lightning that no one else can see, he feels drops of rain and gusts of wind that no one else can feel, and he hears the screams of his daughter as she's taken away by people who don't even exist. Curtis' mother is a schizophrenic and he fears that he might be suffering from the same disease. Is Curtis mentally unstable or is he a modern-day prophet?TAKE SHELTER is an incredibly well-written film that has some amazing acting. Michael Shannon wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award, but he should have been (as an actor, he puts both George Clooney and Brad Pitt to shame). Jessica Chastain gives off another great performances that were actually typical for her in 2011. All of the other supporting actors do a fine job, too.The movie is a character-driven, slow-roasting drama that isn't for everyone. There's minimal dialogue and very little action. But a movie like TAKE SHELTER shouldn't have gobs of dialogue and lots of action.TAKE SHELTER is highly recommended.

1515657,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B006HGXGWU,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","While this superb film came & went without much commercial success, I have no doubt that it'll come to be regarded as a seminal film for this era, which is so permeated with formless fear & dread. The film captures all of that fear & dread in countless aspects: apocalyptic fears, terrorism, insanity, economic collapse, disintegration of the family, drastic climate change, the end of civilization as we know it. Yes, it's about all those things ... and yet it's never ponderous, impressed with its own weight or importance. It's essentially a simple, straightforward story of one man, struggling to hold his life & soul together as nightmarish dreams & visions of doom convince him that he's slipping into the same abyss of mental illness that took his mother.Curtis (a magnificently understated but intense Michael Shannon) is a deeply loving husband & father, working a job that keeps him just a paycheck away from consuming debt. His wife (the glowing Jessica Chastain) sells handmade goods to supplement their income, they have a deaf daughter who needs an expensive operation. Living in tornado country, they're already under threat from the weather, as well as walking a precarious economic tightrope. Curtis is also troubled by the fact that his father ran out on his family when he was young, which makes him all the more determined & desperate to be a good father & husband. But in these times, that's harder & harder for so many working men. In fact, he's lucky to have a job at all, and he knows it.But then he starts having terrible dreams about a strange oily rain, mysterious storms & flocks of birds. In these dreams, loved ones become vicious killers who attack him: his family dog, his best friend, even his beloved wife. And he hears thunder while awake, thunder that nobody else seems to hear. He's approaching the same age his mother was when she developed schizophrenia, and of course he fears that he's inherited whatever genetic flaw it was that destroyed her mind. But by his very nature, desiring to be strong & self-sufficient, he's slow to tell anyone, preferring to check out books on mental illness from his woefully insufficient local library. His doctor recommends an analyst, but Curtis can't afford that; he agrees to see a local counselor, who is caring but clearly overworked & unprepared to cope with his potential problem.Soon he becomes obsessed with repairing & extending the old tornado storm shelter on his property, obviously the way a man who works with his hands tries to retain control of his life, by building something. Yet the dreams are getting worse, and that's starting to affect both his working & home life. Friends & family notice, become uneasy, worried -- all of which makes him even more frightened of what might be happening to him.Finally the crisis comes. What this is, I won't reveal ... but there's more than one crisis here, leading to an ambiguous ending that could be literal, metaphoric, or both. It'll generate a lot of discussion as to its nature. I'll only say that it had to be ambiguous, and doesn't yield to just one ""correct"" explanation. If it has any cinematic antecedent, it would be Peter Weir's 1977 classic ""The Last Wave"" -- very similar in story, but headed in a very different direction, because it deals with very different cultural material.Meanwhile, if you want an emotionally gripping, thought-provoking film that deals with existential dread in contemporary America, putting fantasies of zombies & sci-fi apocalypse to shame as the childish detritus they are, then this is it. There's no escapist nonsense of Stuff Blowed Up Real Good -- what blows up here is the illusion of security & normality we all need to get through everyday life in increasingly uncertain times.
