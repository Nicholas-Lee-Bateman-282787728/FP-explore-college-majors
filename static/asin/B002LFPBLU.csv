1276344,A3GLX47PF4ZN9T,B002LFPBLU,Alex,"[6, 47]","...how so many people could stomach this stuff.Independent does not mean good. This film had some of the worst dialogue and plot tropes than I've ever seen - far worse than any Hollywood blockbuster. It's as if someone gave a major budget to a film school student whose favorite films were ""Gigli"" and ""The Grudge.""This is how I relate: imagine the douchiest art school guy you can. Imagine that his inspiration for filmmaking came from Warhammer. Imagine that he tripped acid to a compilation of corny endings from 80's buddy cop movies, and that this experience was trapped in his spinal fluid. Imagine that somewhere between a marathon viewing of just ""The Transporter"" over and over, and then an Intro to Adobe After Effects course, he decided that he would never do a transition without a shape wipe or a snow effect, and that the number of filters used in a film, especially wash-outs, is directly correlated to its Oscarworthiness.Seeing how many people love this movie is just like being in that same art school and seeing that guy get laid over and over again. What's worse is that this guy also directed the movie. It just makes you lose a little more of the clinging remains of your tolerance of humanity, knowwhatimean?The acting is awful, the dialogue taken directly from a book of cliches. In tandem, they produce an impressively unwatchable experience. As for the plot: it's original, but utterly confused, hookless, and melbetoast. Oozing through everything is a dense, American cheese. And what about the cinematography/special effects, you ask? They're okay.Bottom line: overly serious, unself-aware, unaware of the tropes of its genre, seemingly floating on the originality of its plot alone.

I don't think I have ever seen anything like this and the soundtrack is phenomenal! A very deep and thought provoking story about redemption and the afterlife. Its pretty sad when some one can make a film this great for $300,000 and Twilight cost $110 million that's something to think about?The cinematography is amazing the story line is complex and the acting is emotional in a lot of scenes. If you are not a person that likes challenging films this one will not be for you. I look for movies like this and on blu-ray this movie is worth every penny. I hope that that ""Jamin Winans"" gets a solid distribution deal he deserves it greatly. We need more film makers like him in this industry..for sure! Just think he financed this himself because no studio would produce it now that's something to think about ? But yet Expendables 2 got a theatrical release ?

I know he's watched it at least twice. I've lost track of how many times I've watched it, and my other famous photographer buddy, Shamus Fatzinger of DC said they'd sat down and started watching, but were too tired to finish it, and they knew it was a movie which would command their attention. I can't say enough about this movie, but J. Winans wrote it, directed it, and scored it...and scored a home run along the way. If you want to see a brilliantly filmed adult fairy tale, it's ""ink"" - and it has NOTHING to do with tattoos. Achingly beautiful along the way with a touch of science fiction, you won't get the full impact until you have watched it to the end. And when you find out ""the secret"" you'll want to start watching it all over again. Pick up the original soundtrack while you're at it. It's so much more relaxing than white noise and if you leave it on when you sleep, just under your regular audio range, it'll score many a dream, it's that great. Imagine being lulled to sleep by a soundtrack which will lead you somewhere during your slumber. I can't say enough about ""ink."" J Winans is a genius. A Fn genius with the pen, the camera, and musical instruments. Help support a true artist and BUY THIS FILM. If you REALLY want to surprise yourself, don't look at any of the trailers, and don't read about the storyline. Buy it, prepare yourself for something special, and just watch it.

1276348,A3HN7D7HEQGM1R,B002LFPBLU,"Brendan Foy ""Foy""","[1, 1]","I absolutely loved this gem of a film and had no idea what the heck it was when I rented it from Blockbuster. I don't pirate movies, so I didn't hear of it that way, I just picked it up on a whim because I liked the synopsis and was curious to see why it was compared to other great surreal flicks such as Dark City, Pan's Labyrinth, Matrix and Donnie Darko. Well, it really isn't anything like those other films other than having a parallel dream world as part of the plot and it is exceptional in its own right. I am shocked it was made for only $250,000, what efficient filmmaking! There are skin flicks on Cinemax which cost that much to make. The style and artistic direction really made this film look higher budget than it is and the exceptional acting by Chris Kelly and Quinn Hunchar gave life to the main characters.  The car accident was very well done. I also love tales of redemption.Not every movie is for everyone, but this one really tugged at my heart while spoiling my eyes with visual flare.  What the movie lacks in special effects and CGI they make up for with a stylistic saturation of colors, similar to what you would see in a music video.  This helps the film focus on what matters the most, story and pacing.  I will be adding this to my collection while keeping an eye on talented writer/director, Jamin Winans.",5,Such a Beauty,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,1338,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'gem', 'film', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'when', 'rented', 'Blockbuster', 'do', ""n't"", 'pirate', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'way', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'whim', 'liked', 'synopsis', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'compared', 'other', 'great', 'surreal', 'flicks', 'such', 'Dark', 'City', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'Matrix', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Well', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'other', 'films', 'other', 'having', 'parallel', 'dream', 'world', 'part', 'plot', 'exceptional', 'own', 'right', 'am', 'shocked', 'was', 'made', 'only', '250,000', 'what', 'efficient', 'filmmaking', 'are', 'skin', 'flicks', 'Cinemax', 'cost', 'much', 'make', 'style', 'artistic', 'direction', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'look', 'higher', 'budget', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'Chris', 'Kelly', 'Quinn', 'Hunchar', 'gave', 'life', 'main', 'characters', 'car', 'accident', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'love', 'tales', 'redemption.Not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'one', 'really', 'tugged', 'heart', 'spoiling', 'eyes', 'visual', 'flare', 'What', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'make', 'up', 'stylistic', 'saturation', 'colors', 'similar', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'music', 'video', 'film', 'focus', 'what', 'most', 'story', 'pacing', 'will', 'be', 'adding', 'collection', 'keeping', 'eye', 'talented', 'writer/director', 'Jamin', 'Winans']",N/A
1276349,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B002LFPBLU,Brian Driver,"[1, 1]","'NO SPOILERS WITHIN!""Ink"" is a creative juggernaut.  I mean it...I was floored by how this film did such a great job at what so many multi-million dollar movies fail to do: use every iota of their power to move their audiences.No million dollar cast, no amazing special effects (and for a fantasy movie at that!), no ad campaign whatsoever, and still I sat there stunned by how well this minor little project from an independent film company (Double Edge Films) worked.""Ink"" is a movie that I don't want to tell you too much about, but I will give you the barest of bones: while there are gentle spirits who slip into our bedrooms at night to give us pleasant dreams, a lovely child has an ugly beast slip into her room to steal her away.  For reasons as yet unknown, perhaps even to the spirits themselves, the spirits decide to save this girl, and the movie depicts this struggle.  I should also say that, while a child is central to the work, it is not a work necessarily FOR children.I am sure I have done this movie a disservice to describe its plot in such generalities, but I think the greater disservice would be to rob you of the pleasure at peeling away the layers of this clever, brilliant work.  I was certainly puzzled often as this film moved along its path, and as with many mysterious, ""intellectual"" movies I wondered if I would get it, and if the film would be worth the effort.  Believe me, YOU will, and IT will.  In spades.(Incidentally, I placed the word ""intellectual"" in quotes in the paragraph above because, while I think it is an intellectual film, I don't want you to think it is one of those heady films for nerds.  I think A LOT of people would like this movie.)And while this is indeed a largely metaphoric work, you don't have to be an English major to follow it.  I do feel I need (and want) to see it again, as there are layers of this onion that I will have a more enhanced enjoyment of on my next viewing.  But I think the beauty of ""Ink"" is in -- after breathing ""Wow!"" at the end of your first viewing -- getting together and talking about it with someone.  It's really a bright, bright piece of film making.And to get back to those effects: without cheapening anything, director, writer and co-producer Jamin Winans (who did the editing AND music as well!) deserves much credit for getting inexpensive techniques to do so much.  This is no ""Our Town"" where the people lie on the floor to depict graves or climb a step stool to go upstairs.  But with simply ""Pop!""-ing people into or out of a shot (a technique available to cinematographers since Chaplin), or using lighting, or costumes, or even putting a distorting pane of glass in front of glass in front of some characters' faces, you'll right away feel you're in a whole different level of the world.  It really works, and absolutely doesn't come off as cheap.As with the rest of the film, the actors are first rate.  I've often wondered why we always dote on placing the same elite group of actors in all the films we see, and this is good evidence for not following that route.  Chris Kelly, Jessica Duffy, Jeremy Make...these are names we should be hearing about much more than we are.  They are terrific in their roles and I was surprised to find that none of them have yet been in any major film.  They, like everything else in this fine movie, work wonderfully.If you like smart cinema that works on a variety of levels, you'll love ""Ink.""

It is a morality tale, but with the amount of Narcissism in the world, I'm for anything that asks people to look at themselves. It is basically a story of a father's relationship to his daughter. The plot is complicated by people from other dimensions who control the dreams humans have and inspire them to good or evil. It is the old God versus the Devil scenario, but with a more psychological focus and hot new age warriors who battle strange entities.The ""evil"" entities who represent the sin of ""pride"" are black clad figures whose faces are projected eerily onto glass plates suspended in front of their real faces. ""Ink"" is a dark side ""wanna be"" character who is trying to earn his place with the group by delivering a child to them. To me one of the biggest flaws in this film is the rather laughable fake nose and obvious rubber mask worn by Ink. It made a very scary figure look like a homeless, former reveler in a poorly done Italian Carnival mask.The simple plot is augmented by a few ""new age"" ideas, such as those of the blind character ""Pathfinder"" who can orchestrate links between seemingly unrelated things in order to create major events.

When a dark-robbed figure kidnaps the soul of a young girl, it is up to the Storytellers to awaken her father from his selfish stupor in order to free her from evil's grasp! INK is a mind-blowing visual masterpiece created on a micro-budget, which offers a unique fantasy world of found objects that rivals the ones found in MIRRORMASK or CITY OF LOST CHILDREN at only a fraction of the cost. Director Jamin Winans transforms the mundane into the imaginative through the use of creative camera work, practical effects, and a unique story structure as he weaves together his modern fairy tale. Winans enhances the emotional impact of the images on screen with his own original score.

One of the most heart-felt and redemptive stories I've seen in some time. Occasionally, the low budget does show, but what they were able to accomplish on their shoestring budget is actually quite amazing. To be honest, I almost turned it off after the first 30 minutes or so. It takes a little while to get going and for the audience to get a sense of the direction it's heading. A few of the earlier scenes are a little jarring and occasionally cheesy, too. But about half way through the movie there is a scene that stands apart as one of the very best scenes ever put on film. A scene which changes the trajectory of the whole movie and begins to weave the threads together. The climactic scene of the film is another one that just blew me away. I was literally watching it through tears. You'll know these two scenes when you see them. So I implore you to persevere through the first half of the movie as it gets a whole lot better. And the first half of the film is a lot better on subsequent viewings when you know in advance where it's headed. The cinematography is great, most of the performances (especially the main character) are great, the soundtrack is excellent.

The reason this has such a high score is because I felt the concept of this movie was really awesome, and the ability to turn a simple story of a father's redemption into something epic and still intimate is quite a feat, so the grander rating is for the concept and writing of the story. The dp and the editor of the film have proven themselves able, but need to master filming fights. I understand the use of quick cuts from time to time to add urgency and fury to a battle but when it's used every time there is a fight it loses it's potency and causes the audience to wonder if the actors just couldn't pull off a believable fight. My advice: don't change shots simply to add variety. Like everything else make sure it adds to what's going on. I'm not talking about the 'fantasy' scenes.

The dark and light forces fight over the soul in a thrilling and thought provoking metaphysical world that is linked to the physical one. This science fiction fantasy is packed with action between mesmerizing sequences of relaxation and happiness that offset the dark and uneasy world of the Incubi.The Incubi give nightmares while the Storytellers offer dreams of hope. These two groups battle for Emma (Quinn Hunchar) in this alternate realm, where time runs differently, as she lays in a coma in the real world after Ink took her essence to prove his worthiness to become an Incubi. Her only hope is for the Storytellers to change the path of her father, John (Chris Kelly). A series of events changed John from a loving and caring person to a deeply hurt and broken man. With the quest to change John underway another Storyteller, Liev (Jessica Duffy), attempts to adjust Ink's thinking to not continue following the path he is on.8 out of 10 - A strait forward and simple tale this is not; it is open to some interpretation making the film difficult to follow at times. It does come together more as the film advances, but in the end it may take some nonlinear thinking to understand. Still, this is a very interesting and mind blowing film that intrigues your senses and perception. The acting was fitting for the film, but could be considered a little flat. Jamin Winans, Kiowa K.

If you're every wondering how seriously to take a reviews just check the other reviews an individual has written and sometimes you'll see a pattern that might help you make up your mind if a film is for you.This wasn't so much a movie in my mind as just a really well told story.  It reminded me of the Firefly series with regard to the quality of acting and dialog.  The actors are really comfortable in their characters, which is what makes any story real.  This isn't something I would let my kids see, at least not until they were in their early teens.  This isn't for kids, it's a story that parents should watch, or anyone who may be a parent soon.  Life gets strangely tougher and tougher the older we get, and it's easy to lose our way in the perceived complexities.  This story is about a father who loses his way after dealing with tragedies and unhappiness in his life, and how the kernels of goodness in him help him to come back from edge of true destruction.  Yes, the language is realistic for people going through tough times, and yes there is some fighting (actually underplayed I though for how well those scenes were choreographed), but the interactions between the Storyteller, the little girl, and Ink are what make the story.I'm an former straight-leg infantry soldier (for those of you who know what that means) who grew up in the deserts of Nevada, I have an awesome wife, two young children, and a busy work life.

And caught between them is Ink.That's the concept behind ""Ink,"" a surreal, eerily-filmed movie clothed in haunting questions about life, death, dreams, nightmares, good and evil. Jamin Winans' second full-length movie has a pretty weird vibe -- think Neil Gaiman directing ""It's a Wonderful Life"" -- but it ends up being a dizzying, beautiful journey through a strange other world.A creature named Ink appears in the bedroom of a girl named Emma, and kidnaps both her and a Storyteller named Liev. Ink  hopes to become an Incubus, and Emma is his one chance. Emma falls into a deep coma, and her father John refuses to go see her because his in-laws snatched custody of her away because of his alcohol and drug problems.In the meantime, the Storytellers set out to rescue Emma and Liev from Ink, and must get some help from a blind Pathfinder who can change reality as he wishes. And as Ink drags his prisoners to Drifters who hold a code he must claim, Liev begins to sow seeds of doubt about what he is doing -- and his true nature and horrendous past come to light.""Ink"" is the sort of movie that people like to hold up as an example of independent cinema -- unique, groundbreaking and cool. It's filmed in that luminous grey-toned style that ""Sin City"" was, and Winans fills it with a sense of neo-urban surrealism -- the goth Storyteller, trash-filled warehouses, electric-tape on Jacob's eyes, and tattered pockets with weird Drifters dwelling in them.Winans both directed and wrote this movie, and both show a lot of care. His story jumbles time, space and dimensions, playing tricks with your mind; and he crams it with slightly off-kilter scenes that  are brilliantly simple (Jacob finding ""links"" on an urban street). And he has a knack for horror -- the Incubi are depicted as terrifyingly, artificially cheerful screens in front of faces. You don't SEE their true faces, but you know it's horrific.But he also shows that he can pluck at your heartstrings in rare style, particularly as we find out what Ink did to become the tattered, crowlike figure we see. The latter parts of the movie are a haunting, painful celebration of love's power, without any sappy platitudes.Well, it would be giving away too much too much to say who/what Ink is. So I'll just say that Christopher Soren Kelly is brilliant at conveying Ink's tortured emotions from inside a shell of rags and a beak-nose.

Those comparrisons are way wrong. This is in no way like those movies. Meaning, it is not on thier level but is still a good obscure movie for fans of this genre.Our story of the girl being in a coma and the plot that some beings bring us our good dreams and some bring us bad dreams was very original and I loved that part.What made me drop my review a bit was the lack in continuity. There is a scene where a woman is in the room with the child next to her bed. She cannot be seen or touched and makes sure not to touch the girl's hair when reaching for her BUT she sits on the bed which effects the movement or interaction with the girl. Holes like this just bugged me.One more example is when Ink is actually saving the girl but she tries to yell for help, she reaches for a woman (flat palmed) as though she was going to push her and not grab her or poke her. In real life, she would have grabbed or poked the woman. Not put her arm out like she already knew she couldn't interact with the woman.As I said, it is a good obscure plot, well made for the most part and very original.

I received several angry responses from people who were upset that I attacked the fact that there were so many shills writing in to boost the sales/rentals of the film as opposed to addressing the film itself. They were correct, so here it goes.This movie simply is not that good. Not on any level. the acting is lousy accept for the little girl and the ""story teller."" the whole thing needed to be shot on film as opposed to video. Whatever moods were trying to be created just did not come across. The wardrobe stunk, and I do not know where all the ""powerful images"" were that some of the reviewers spoke of. There was nothing powerful in anything I saw. The characters with the screens over their faces along with the glowing eye beings were supposed to evoke (I guess) some nightmarish, horror image, but I found it only strange for strange sake.The story was written in strokes that were way too broad. It needed much more detail everywhere. Take the ""good guys."" You have this band of people who first fail to protect the little girl, then have to go and rescue her. Who are they? They have no names and we don't get to know them, so when they get into their various scrapes, there's no emotional dimension to involve the audience. Then there's the pathfinder. There was some attempt to create a character here but nowhere near enough was done to flesh him out. The tape over his eyes was merely strange and didn't add anything to his character. He was, though, in the one and only good scene in the entire movie where he orchestrates a cause and effect ballet which puts ""Ink"" in the hospital.The music score was OK with one piece that stuck out as being better than the rest but I'm grasping at straws here. The editing was uneven at best and poor in most parts. If you put this up against the film ""Franklyn"", which is not that dissimilar, you would find Franklyn excels at every level.

1276381,A1KRNQWUNCTJS3,B002LFPBLU,joebobhenrybob,"[17, 56]","(...some recommendations of what might be nice to watch instead are at the end of my review.  If you're looking for a kid's movie, be sure to check the rating, not all the ones I listed are PG - Sprited Away is a fantastic choice if you are looking for something to watch with your kid and IS everything this movie and its 5-star reviews promise and fail to deliver on.)Warning - There are many sub-professional aspects to this film.  If you have an academic interest in this film as a film-maker, film student, film teacher, great, but as an actual movie a consumer is thinking of purchasing or renting, think twice.If you are looking for a sort of magical journey kind of movie, your money would be much better spent going with something made by Jean-Pierre Jeunet or Guillermo Del Toro.  (Hellboy 2, probably Del Toro's most mainstream movie, is STILL more artistic than Ink...  and probably has far less total minutes taken up by fight scenes than Ink.  Ink has a LOT of time spent on choreographed fight scenes.)  Or if you haven't seen it yet, watch The Fisher King.  For about the same price as renting Ink, you could get a well-written, well-shot, well-acted version of what was attempted with the Ink character.  Kids and grownups would get an infinitely more wondrous journey watching Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away.  Or heck, The Labyrinth or The Neverending Story.The film comes off as if it were a first draft.  Just the way it was shot is on an amateur level - I don't mean the camera is bouncing around like Blair Witch or Cloverfield, I mean a lot of the time, the director doesn't seem to be thinking seriously about very basic things like where he is placing the actors or the camera to make the scene look interesting on a basic level.  The dialogue is oftentimes badly written - the most obvious thing to say is what gets said.  The plotline is predictable.Overall, it looks like someone had a bag of interesting tricks they knew they could use, some decent overall concepts, and tried to flesh that into a full length film.  There was one scene in particular that was actually really interesting and it is well-enough done that anyone watching the film will recognize which scene I am referring to... but a 5 minute scene can't justify a 140+ minute movie.  (... also there is a scene using almost EXACTLY the same concept in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie Delicatessen, not sure if that's a case of great minds think alike or heavy influence)It's obvious a lot of effort must have gone into Ink, even just from the number of locations and people involved.  From that perspective... one is really tempted to start reviewing it as a student or amateur effort and cut it some slack, but this is a film being sold on amazon, not something your favorite nephew made in AV class that you will sit down and indulge for his sake.  If you are looking for an evening's entertainment, you can do much, much better - in fact, you get a better chance of seeing a movie fitting this movie's description if you search elsewhere.The Fisher KingHellboy II: The Golden Army (3 Disc Special Edition)Spirited AwayPan's LabyrinthAmelieA Very Long EngagementThe City of Lost ChildrenThe Neverending Story [Blu-ray]Labyrinth [Blu-ray]",1,Student Film,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,3229,"['recommendations', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'watch', 'instead', 'are', 'end', 'review', ""'re"", 'looking', 'kid', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'rating', 'not', 'ones', 'listed', 'are', 'PG', 'Sprited', 'Away', 'fantastic', 'choice', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'watch', 'kid', 'everything', 'movie', '5-star', 'reviews', 'promise', 'fail', 'deliver', 'Warning', 'are', 'many', 'sub-professional', 'aspects', 'film', 'have', 'academic', 'interest', 'film', 'film-maker', 'film', 'student', 'film', 'teacher', 'great', 'actual', 'movie', 'consumer', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'renting', 'think', 'are', 'looking', 'sort', 'magical', 'journey', 'kind', 'movie', 'money', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'spent', 'going', 'something', 'made', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'Toro', '2', 'probably', 'Del', 'Toro', 'most', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'STILL', 'more', 'artistic', 'Ink', 'probably', 'far', 'less', 'total', 'minutes', 'taken', 'up', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Ink', 'Ink', 'LOT', 'time', 'spent', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'watch', 'Fisher', 'King', 'same', 'price', 'renting', 'Ink', 'could', 'get', 'well-written', 'well-shot', 'well-acted', 'version', 'what', 'was', 'attempted', 'Ink', 'character', 'Kids', 'grownups', 'would', 'get', 'infinitely', 'more', 'wondrous', 'journey', 'watching', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'heck', 'Labyrinth', 'Neverending', 'Story.The', 'film', 'off', 'were', 'first', 'draft', 'Just', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'amateur', 'level', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'camera', 'bouncing', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Cloverfield', 'mean', 'lot', 'time', 'director', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'thinking', 'seriously', 'very', 'basic', 'things', 'where', 'placing', 'actors', 'camera', 'make', 'scene', 'look', 'interesting', 'basic', 'level', 'dialogue', 'oftentimes', 'badly', 'written', 'most', 'obvious', 'thing', 'say', 'what', 'said', 'plotline', 'predictable.Overall', 'someone', 'had', 'bag', 'interesting', 'tricks', 'knew', 'could', 'use', 'decent', 'overall', 'concepts', 'tried', 'flesh', 'full', 'length', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'interesting', 'well-enough', 'done', 'anyone', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'recognize', 'scene', 'am', 'referring', '5', 'minute', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'justify', '140+', 'minute', 'movie', 'also', 'scene', 'using', 'almost', 'EXACTLY', 'same', 'concept', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'movie', 'Delicatessen', 'not', 'sure', 'case', 'great', 'minds', 'think', 'heavy', 'influence', 'obvious', 'lot', 'effort', 'must', 'have', 'gone', 'Ink', 'even', 'just', 'number', 'locations', 'people', 'involved', 'perspective', 'one', 'really', 'tempted', 'start', 'reviewing', 'student', 'amateur', 'effort', 'cut', 'slack', 'film', 'being', 'sold', 'amazon', 'not', 'something', 'favorite', 'nephew', 'made', 'AV', 'class', 'will', 'sit', 'down', 'indulge', 'sake', 'are', 'looking', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'fact', 'get', 'better', 'chance', 'seeing', 'movie', 'fitting', 'movie', 'description', 'search', 'elsewhere.The', 'Fisher', 'KingHellboy', 'II', 'Golden', 'Army', '3', 'Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Spirited', 'AwayPan', 'LabyrinthAmelieA', 'Very', 'Long', 'EngagementThe', 'City', 'Lost', 'ChildrenThe', 'Neverending', 'Story', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Labyrinth', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",N/A

1276389,A1CKY01WDLN1DK,B002LFPBLU,M. Zveris,"[0, 1]","Ink is a very strange movie that is enjoyable just for that fact.  It centers around a little girl (Emma) who is stolen from her bed (whilst sleeping) and left comatose despite the best efforts of protectors - Story Tellers - who spend the nights keeping sleepers safe.Her father (John) is at once uncomfortable with his role as a parent and attempting very hard to be there for his daughter.  It is almost painful to watch the way he interacts with his daughter, coworkers, and himself.  The way that he handles his life is perhaps so painful because it shows the darker natures of our own being.  He is not a terrible man, nor is he a good man, and his progression throughout the film is inspiring.  Even the way he copes with his pain is difficult and hard to comprehend.Our young heroine / captive is delightfully imaginative and elegantly strange.  Unlike most little girls who spend their lives playing with dolls in the tea party variety she is a dedicated tomboy, and endearing for it.  She seems to understand with the coy intuitiveness of a child precisely how to interact with those around her.The Story Tellers dedicated to our perfection and peace during the time of sleeping are both strangely detached and overly loving.  They exemplify the roles of protectors very well, trying to remain above situations and still maintain a compassion for those they protect.Ink is a frightening fellow because of his entire desire to belong which is echoed by the other characters in the film.  His desperation is palpable throughout the movie.  Without revealing plot, the twist of the ending - or rather its resolution - is both heartening and touching.The dream sequences of the movie, in fact, the entire movie is incredibly interestingly filmed.  It is both pleasant and delightfully odd.  The effects of the cameas are both heightening to the overall eery and always dreamlike qualities of the film and distracting.  The film cuts around a lot as we learn about Jacob, John, Emma, and the other characters.  While some of the images and presentations of characters can be grating they are acceptable because we are in a dream world for almost the entire movie.  It makes sense when we stop to examine the odd way our own dreams present themselves.While it isn't perfectly filmed and is clearly a lower budget production, Ink has a very different take on a common storyline: redemption and family.

I went into it without any preconceived notions since I'd never even heard of the film before, much less read any reviews. Let me just say that those giving this film 1-2 stars are way off their mark. Say what you want about cinematography and production values (this is a low budget film) the movie is convincingly beautiful and at times spectacular. There are moments where it has rough edges (for example the 2nd ""drifter"" is very much overdone) but cumulatively this is a very enjoyable film. The story is a bit hard to follow at times and occasionally the acting runs a little thin, but that is overcome by believable central characters and a few very interesting and well done scenes. I absolutely loved the 'butterfly effect' montage in the middle of the film, as well as the film's concluding sequence. The central love story was very well done and convincing--a love story that actually showed some characterization instead of just sexuality as shorthand for love.The best part of the film? The score. Flat out the best score I've heard in quite a long time. Ambient, downbeat, symphonic; it elevates the film a whole star in my opinion and takes what would simply be a 'good' movie and makes it into a memorable one. There is so much tripe pushed out by Hollywood these days that it's nice to see a lower budget film put them in their place. This is a wonderful little film, and if you enjoy science fiction or fantasy, you'd be remiss to skip it.4/5 Stars.",4,At times spectacular,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,1532,"['rented', 'INK', 'good', 'friend', 'mine', 'recommended', 'went', 'preconceived', 'notions', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'read', 'reviews', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'giving', 'film', '1-2', 'stars', 'are', 'way', 'mark', 'Say', 'what', 'want', 'cinematography', 'production', 'values', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'movie', 'convincingly', 'beautiful', 'times', 'spectacular', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'rough', 'edges', 'example', '2nd', 'drifter', 'very', 'much', 'overdone', 'cumulatively', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'story', 'bit', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'occasionally', 'acting', 'little', 'thin', 'overcome', 'believable', 'central', 'characters', 'few', 'very', 'interesting', 'well', 'done', 'scenes', 'absolutely', 'loved', ""'butterfly"", 'effect', 'montage', 'middle', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'concluding', 'sequence', 'central', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'convincing', 'love', 'story', 'actually', 'showed', 'characterization', 'instead', 'just', 'sexuality', 'shorthand', 'love.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'score', 'Flat', 'best', 'score', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'Ambient', 'downbeat', 'symphonic', 'film', 'whole', 'star', 'opinion', 'what', 'would', 'simply', 'be', ""'good"", 'movie', 'memorable', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'tripe', 'pushed', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'nice', 'see', 'lower', 'budget', 'film', 'put', 'place', 'wonderful', 'little', 'film', 'enjoy', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', ""'d"", 'be', 'remiss', 'skip', 'it.4/5', 'Stars']",N/A

It sounds, from the various descriptions one finds around the web, like a family film, though not necessarily a children's film (the closest analogue I had in my head, before I started watching, was &lt;em>Paperhouse&lt;/em>). But then you get to that opening sequence, where John (Chris Kelly, returning from &lt;em>11:59&lt;/em>) comes storming out of an office building, throws himself into his car, and begins cursing a blue streak at the top of his lungs while driving off at high speed in midtown traffic, and okay, this is not a film for kids at all, eh? And yet, the basic premise of the film is still right in that young-adult-fantasy niche: Emma (terminally cute Quinn Hunchar in her first screen appearance), John's estranged eight-year-old daughter, has her soul stolen by Ink, a demon who inahbits a parallel universe. But I'm getting well ahead of myself.Plot: There is a universe parallel to ours, but whose denizens interact with us constantly. On one side we have the Storytellers, who come into our world at night, often dressed in the height of eighties fashion, and bring us dreams. On the other side are the Incubi, who wear a lot of pleather and very cool visors, and who are responsible for bringing us nightmares. Ink (short, of course, for Incubus) is a wannabe-dark soul who is trying to find a perfect gift to bring the leader of the Incubi in order to get himself a promotion (and cooler threads). He chooses the soul of Emma (Hunchar) and abducts it; in our world, she goes into a coma and no one can figure out why. Her grandparents, who wrested custody of her from John after their daughter died (we find out how somewhat later in the film), try to reach out to John, who started out selling junk bonds in a boiler room and is now a multi-millionaire executive, to come and be with his daughter. He throws the bitter words they told him during the court battle (specifically, ""you no longer have a daughter"") back in his face and escorts them out of the office while on the verge of a deal that could allow him to retire in this thirties. But beneath the quotidian veneer, the storytellers and the incubi are fighting for control of Emma's soul, and Allel (&lt;em>Skills Like This&lt;/em>' Jennifer Batter), Emma's storyteller, ropes in a couple of her pals, Sarah (&lt;em>Hidden Lives&lt;/em>' Shelby Malone) and Gabe (&lt;em>The New Republic&lt;/em>'s Eme Ikuwakor), and hires a pathfinder, Jacob (&lt;em>Suburban&lt;/em>'s Jeremy Make), to see if there are any...alternative options for getting Emma's soul from Ink before he can turn it over. But other forces are at work here, as well: Liev (&lt;em>The Inner Room&lt;/em>'s Jessica Duffy), who is either the leader of the storytellers or just a legendarily powerful one (that point is never made clear), has also taken an interest in this fight, and moves to protect Emma in her own way as well. Meanwhile, the Incubi are amassing their defenses, including sending one of their own (Troy Garner in his first feature appearance) to shadow John 24/7, a move made only in the most extreme circumstances...The best thing about &lt;em>Ink&lt;/em>, by far, is the care that went into the worldbuilding here. Winans, who also wrote the screenplay, obviously put tremendous thought into the storytellers, the incubi, and how their world interacts with ours. Just based on the ease of the flow there, Winans probably came up with hundreds of little details that never made it into the story, but colored his perceptions of how these worlds interact. That's a must with worldbuilding, and every author worth his salt knows it, but it's rare to find in movies. It really adds to the atmosphere here.The worst thing about it is that the fragmenting of the movie's timeline is handled badly. I don't know whether I'm just watching more movies that do this nowadays or whether it's becoming more common for filmmakers to try and pull off these sorts of time stunts in the post-&lt;em>Memento&lt;/em> world, but very few people seem to be able to do them right, even in movies I otherwise adore. The most common question by far on the IMDB board for this movie is ""what the hell happened in the last scene?"", and I admit, I jaunted over there after I finished watching the movie to see if my interpretation of what I'd just seen was right. (According to the prevailing wisdom, it wasn't, and I get the arguments made for the prevailing wisdom--but I still think my alternate explanation of the end makes as much sense given the clues sprinkled throughout the movie.)Sitting in the middle is that overweening sense of wrongness I alluded to right at the very beginning of this review. The whole childlike-sense-of-wonder thing is really, really cool, and I appreciate that Winans was--I assume--trying to bring that into a more adult-themed movie. The problem is, it's not an adult-themed movie, is a kid- (or young-adult)-themed movie that attempts to prove its ""adultness"" solely through the use of what is euphemistically termed as ""adult language"" in the MPAA's system. Looked at as a YA fantasy, it's complex, inviting, and at times probably inappropriate (again, because of the language). Looked at as an adult fantasy film, it's somewhat less. It tries to have its feet in two different worlds, much the way its supernatural characters do, but the film itself is far less adept at bridging them. Still, it's worth watching, and there is a gem hidden under these rags. You can see a good deal of it at times as you watch this movie. ***",3,"Not great, but there's a lot of very good here.",1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,5733,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Ink', 'lt', '>',

1276402,A18TSDA9ZRLKVM,B002LFPBLU,"Robert S. ""geek hipster""","[1, 1]","I am glad I bought this film sight unseen, having only heard some good things in the alt. press.  'Ink' is not a major film, it didn't have a major release, or advertising.  It was made by a couple in Colorado who wanted to make it.  They raised the money to do the project themselves.  Their friends helped. They made their own costumes, made their own music.  The actors are mostly unknown, and up and coming.I don't want to give away the plot hook, suffice it to say that Ink is a modern fairytale about fatherhood, told as a battle between forces of light and darkness, with the key players being a girl in a coma, and her estranged father. The supporting characters are the Storytellers, beatific beings who give people good dreams, and the Incubus, dark beings who give people nightmares. And then there is the enigmatic Ink, who carries Emma into the dreamrealm, to sacrifice her to the Incubus to insure his transformation into one of them.  The how and the why is where the real drama of this film lies, and it's ultimate revelation is one the most emotionally profound moments of redemption in any film I saw of 2009. It brought me to tears. Finding it in such a small film is quite special.I did find there was a confusing bit of character development in the film that felt like a cheat, but on repeat viewings realized the film uses a non-linear narrative device. The title of this review is the clue.A word on the transfer: this film is quite beautiful in hi-def.  Now, there are alot of overblown contrasts, image softening and color treatments, some heavy digital noise in the darkest segments, but detail is usually very sharp, if not striking.  I found all of the photography choices quite clever, and lend to a strong nostalgic feel. The sound mix is very clear at low volume, except for the dialogue gets a little quiet near the climax.  The music by director Jamin Winans is magisterial, and perfectly lends to the action and emotion of the story.I can't recommend this film enough. Rent it.

Grandcolas ""Stiggs""","[2, 3]","I am not going to waste your time repeating all the four and five start reviews for Ink, but I'd like to make a a few addtional comments.Ink has eye dazzling special effects but Ink is not just eye candy (albiet sometimes dark eye candy). The excellent story and the films ending is greater than the sum of the whole of all the eye popping effects - and this is what a sci-fi, fantasy or spiritual film should be - and which films most are not.A few folks complained that there are some ""lesser experienced"" actors in Ink - but I feel this is OK in that it enhanced the naivete or innocence that was a large part of many of the characters personalities. The entire cast deserves top marks for their performances.I also liked that Ink has a spiritual message concerning the soul, the possiblity for redemption, that someone may be looking out for us and that God exists.  Spoiler: (I believe that this is true because the Path-Finder (or one of the angels) speaks of God in one short scene). But - and this is important - Ink never preaches or bludgeon you with its perspectives.  In any case the final message leaves the audience with a feeling of genuine hope - a rarity with the multitude of dark nihilistc endings that we come to expect these days.Ink displays top skills in story telling, ingenuity, editing, photography, imagination, and a whole gamet of film-making techniques. The film makers also made one of the best possible uses of a very limited budget that I have ever seen. They certainly got the biggest bang for their buck!According to Ink's director - Ink was made for $250,000 - that is truly amazing - and with the quality of the final product - easily pushes the film into 4 and 5 star category.  You will understand what I mean when you see the picture.If you want to know more about Ink you can read all the other four and five start reviews.  Better yet - see it for yourself.My only caveat - Ink deserves a rich 5.1 surround and not the simple two channel that is on the disks. Something to look forward too someday?

At first I was a bit put off by the low budget camera work and obvious raw acting by some of the cast.  I thought it was going to be another cheesy direct-to-DVD snooze fest.  However, as the film went on it grew on me.  At the end I was hooked.  Ink left me with the same feeling that other visually-striking films such as The Fall, Dark City, and Equilibrium did.  I wanted to watch it again, and it stuck with me days after I'd seen it.After researching the film and the writer/director/producer/composer/etc. Jamin Winans, I was thoroughly impressed with what he had created.  This is an extremely talented man who made a very impressive film about the internal struggles many of us experience every day.Did everything work in this film?  Not at all.  But the overall story was thought-provoking and lasting.  Not every performance was nailed but the leads were very impressive.  I especially thought Chris Kelly did an outstanding job of showing a range of emotions and really captured the essence of a man at the end of his rope.All in all, I think Winans got everything he possibly could have with the resources around him.  I have a feeling this is just the beginning of a solid career for him.  Support independent film and check this one out.

Silly, unlikeable comic-book characters (no, not ""graphic novel,"" but more like a hasty '80s knock-off of some dimly-remembered '50s meme); rote chopsocky ""fights"" that go on and on with lots of grunts and people being hurled around and smashed against things without suffering any damage; endless ""we need another 30 seconds of filler"" passages of captive girls being led or dragged on meaningless treks.  When it was over, I thought well, maybe reading too many good adventure/horror/graphic novels has made me jaded and it really wasn't that bad, so I turned to my friend Ruth who had also sat through it and said ""So, what did you think?""  She hemmed and hawed a bit so I said ""Well, how would you rate it?""

The birch forest shots are truly breathtaking. Also memorable is the sequence orchestrating the protagonist's car crash.

Will she be taken, or will she live?  A universe filled with dream-land warriors seeks to battle for her fate in the real world.  Storytellers, Pathfinders, and Incubi.  Hospital visits and business deals.The film is rather rough around the edges - the acting isn't top notch with no-names, it feels like it was shot on home video cameras.  It reminded me of lower-budget professional films:  Fireproof, the Left Behind series, stuff you'd see on SyFy on a Sunday afternoon, etc.  It's indie - take it for what you will.However, I was able to ignore the above for one simple reason:  the material was better.  The SFX are great, the visuals are haunting, the story is moving.  It does have an amateur feel - but I actually didn't find this a distraction.  In a sense, it made the film more real... how many people do you really know who act or behave in the fashion popular actors do in Hollywood films?

Everything about this film is so unique and beatiful- from the captivating story and cinematography to the film score. It's hard to believe this movie started out with no budget.The film is about two forces agianst each other, as typical with many movies, good vs evil, the forces of light vs the incubi respectively. The forces of light give the world good dreams, while the incubi give nightmares. One day a girl is kidnapped by a mysterious evil named Ink, and the forces of light must go after her, as her father wallows away in depression.Every frame in this movie is astounding on a visual level. The best part is really the color scheme and overtones. The colors of the movie represent all the different emotions the characters experience. Sepia represents peacefulness/happiness, darkness is dark blue/green, etc... The performances are strong, and the action is mind blowing. The dark look and tone of this film is something very special. Chris Kelly is wonderful as the father in this film. There's an extra on the dvd where he's interviewing the actress who plays the little girl which is very touching.The only flaw with this film is there is one scene where the dialogue makes me cringe, specifically between one of the heroes and the pathfinder. But luckily it's only 1 minute of the film.This movie is not for everyone. It's for the crowd that enjoy a lot of style and weird pacing. It has a good story, and it will definitely go over well with a mix between the Donnie Darko/Dark City crowd. This is one of my favorite films. In my opinion it's a lot better than Donnie Darko, which is another movie I enjoy, but feel it lacks a good twist. This movie is not so about a twist, but telling a compelling story which keeps the movie goer interested. It suceeds on this level. Some may find there are surprising momemts though.*A quick thing to note is that I found out about this from the Franklyn page on amazon. This movie is much better than that one, but I still enjoy that one.

They even have some ""steam punk"" usage, actually quite a bit, and the special effects are reasonable and not the main point of the movie. It actually has a story line and a plot, something missing in most of the new releases we are getting out of hollywood these days that are weak in that department. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys fantasy/sci-fi/drama type movies.

This movie defies easy description: there's a family drama centered on a ruthless workaholic, but layered together with a fantastical faceoff between unexplained agents of positive and negative dreamworlds. And, despite a total lack of explanation for anything, the two clearly tell the same story. Visuals (no I won't give any spoilers) have impact despite simplicity - I don't know the name for the dark force in this flick, but they make The Strangers fromDark Citylook positively jovial. Effects are simple but effective, like the windows and furniture that shatter and reform as the otherworld combatants throw each other around. Even things like color and contrast demarcate different dimensions of this complex world, helping to orient a visitor like me to what's where and when. Editing has a jagged, nervous quality that some might find jarring - it seemed to me just to echo the uncertain qualities of every reality involved. On top of it all, they got a child actor, a very cute girl who looks to be eight or so, with more range and presence than a few headliners I can name.No big studio would have put a buck behind this complex, intelligent, and dark fantasy. No one snappy catchphrase sums it all up, no one comparison orients anyone trying to imagine it. And it certainly isn't for viewers who need full explanations and clear direction - you're picked up and thrown into a story with huge unspoken history and rules only guessed as you go along.

Had it been animated or handled by a more experienced director (or a team of artists like those who did Coraline) it could have been truly amazing, but it suffers from a lack of imagination in certain key areas and this has nothing to do with its purportedly low budget: dialogue, direction, acting, costume are not given enough thought or attention. The decision to make the main character for e.g. look like a sad version of Cyrano de Bergerac was laughable, as was misguided the decision to make the ass-kicking defenders of dreams out of a weird mix of 80s punk rock types and renaissance fair devotees. Genres and styles uneasily rub against one another while the actors are often at a loss for words and the director struggles to make the whole cohere. Yes, there are beautiful moments and beautiful words (uttered basically by one character) but these unfortunately fail to effectively build toward what should have been (at least for me) a less predictable conclusion.  If you are one who generally appreciates the fantasy genre or films that strive to break the mold, you may well like this film, but personally I liked it only for what it allowed me to glimpse it could have been.",3,"An admirable attempt, but with real flaws",1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,1346,"['main', 'concept', 'refreshingly', 'new', 'attempt', 'provide', 'evocative', 'scenes', 'admirable', 'execution', 'film', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Had', 'been', 'animated', 'handled', 'more', 'experienced', 'director', 'team', 'artists', 'who', 'did', 'Coraline', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'amazing', 'lack', 'imagination', 'certain', 'key', 'areas', 'nothing', 'do', 'purportedly', 'low', 'budget', 'dialogue', 'direction', 'acting', 'costume', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'thought', 'attention', 'decision', 'make', 'main', 'character', 'e.g', 'look', 'sad', 'version', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'was', 'laughable', 'was', 'misguided', 'decision', 'make', 'ass-kicking', 'defenders', 'dreams', 'weird', 'mix', '80s', 'punk', 'rock', 'types', 'renaissance', 'fair', 'devotees', 'Genres', 'styles', 'uneasily', 'rub', 'one', 'actors', 'are', 'often', 'loss', 'words', 'director', 'make', 'whole', 'cohere', 'Yes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'beautiful', 'words', 'uttered', 'basically', 'one', 'character', 'unfortunately', 'fail', 'effectively', 'build', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'less', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'generally', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'films', 'strive', 'break', 'mold', 'may', 'well', 'like', 'film', 'personally', 'liked', 'only', 'what', 'allowed', 'glimpse', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A
