It puts the well known characters into a specific time and place. Episodes are fun to watch, the acting is first rate. Has a different feel than Last of the Summer Wine -Only once criticism: This set DOES NOT have captions. The British accents are not always easy for me to understand. With Last of the Summer Wine it took a few viewings to be able to really listen to the dialogue. The BBC releases of Last of the Summer Wine also have captions, which made it easier to follow. This is not a BBC Video release and does not have captions.",5,Excellent!,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,660,"['was', 'great', 'be', 'able', 'finally', 'see', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'well', 'known', 'characters', 'specific', 'time', 'place', 'Episodes', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'different', 'feel', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Wine', '-Only', 'once', 'criticism', 'set', 'DOES', 'NOT', 'have', 'captions', 'British', 'accents', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'understand', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'took', 'few', 'viewings', 'be', 'able', 'really', 'listen', 'dialogue', 'BBC', 'releases', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'also', 'have', 'captions', 'made', 'easier', 'follow', 'not', 'BBC', 'Video', 'release', 'not', 'have', 'captions']",First of the Summer Wine

1667717,ATQTLLURVJA60,B00ELE8DYG,W. Christie,"[0, 0]","I love LAST OF THE SUMMER WINE, and thought FIRST of the Summer Wine, which depicts the main characters of ""LAST"" in their youth, was a great idea. However, the actualization of this clever idea was tedious and dull. The youthful actors over played every scene, and the entire series was filmed predominantly on a sound stage. The plots were often over-the-top and never very funny. I can see why this program only lasted one Season. I would not recommend purchase.  Again, this was a clever idea not executed with any finesse or cleverness.",1,Banal - not worth purchasing,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,541,"['love', 'LAST', 'THE', 'SUMMER', 'WINE', 'thought', 'FIRST', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'main', 'characters', 'LAST', 'youth', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'However', 'actualization', 'clever', 'idea', 'was', 'tedious', 'dull', 'youthful', 'actors', 'played', 'scene', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'predominantly', 'sound', 'stage', 'plots', 'were', 'often', 'over-the-top', 'never', 'very', 'funny', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'program', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'Season', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'Again', 'was', 'clever', 'idea', 'not', 'executed', 'finesse', 'cleverness']",First of the Summer Wine
