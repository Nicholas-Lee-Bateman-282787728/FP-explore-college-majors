It's completely obvious if you've read anything at all about the financial meltdown.  If you want to know how regular folks get screwed by financial companies in a quick two hours, check out this flick.  Some of the jargon may be a bit confusing if you don't know much about financial instruments, but it really doesn't matter ... it'll be pretty clear what's going on pretty quickly.The film can be a bit heavy-handed with obvious contrasts at times (the dying dog for example), but the acting was excellent.  Zachary Quinto was outstanding although this is really more of an ensemble cast movie not so much a movie with a lead actor as one can probably tell from the description.

1458396,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B005FITIGO,Acute Observer,"[0, 6]","Margin Call, 2011 filmThe movie begins with a time-lapse photo of lower Manhattan, the financial center of America. Grim-faced people leave their offices carrying their belongings in a cardboard box. Another down-sizing? A young woman walks around checking names on a list. Most people are being ""transitioned"" from their company. They can take their personal belongings, their access is revoked. [No warnings at all? It's always best to keep very little of your personal belongings at your office.] A man's phone doesn't work either. The manager talks to the survivors. Later he grieves over his sick dog. [Harry Truman said if you want a true friend in Washington buy a dog.] One office worker gets a surprise when viewing his computer and calls his co-worker. ""Look at this!"" A projected loss greater than the value of the company? The top manager is called at 11pm!They learn about the projection of volatility. Can they find Eric Dale? There is a meeting with upper management, they look over the reports. There is a problem. It can't be hidden! Can the figures be verified? These Mortgage Backed Securities were popular, but increased risk in case of decreased value. [Were they examples of fraud?] The top manager is there because of his judgment in predicting the future. Can they avoid big losses? By selling to suckers at the current fair market value price! Will they ever trust them again? ""Remember this day."" Will somebody have to take the blame for their problem? Who else? Eric Dale reminisces about a bridge built 22 years earlier. Will he come back.? Who will be let go next? Does the cigarette smoking symbolize their unhealthy actions? ""Is it the right thing to do?"" [The story has slow spots.] Eric Dale returns to the office! The guys below take the blame.There is a meeting about unwinding the assets of the company by liquidating its holdings of fixed-income MBS today. There is a promised big bonus for this fire sale. They unload big blocks as soon as possible, taking losses. Sam wants out. The top manager mentions the dates of previous crashes and depressions since the 18th century. Sam will stay, he needs the money. Will there be new opportunities in getting out of this mess? Sam's dog died. [Does digging the grave symbolize self-punishment?]This is not as dramatic (or educational) as Oliver Stone's 1989 movie ""Wall Street"". This seems like a lower budget production (filmed at night). It really doesn't educate the viewer about the swindling in the Wall Street Jungle that caused the implosion that caused the worst economic depression in seventy years. Mortgage Backed Securities were a sophisticated swindle where low-rated mortgages were magically transformed into high-rated mortgages and sold to investors abroad and at home. When people couldn't pay their mortgages (due to low wages and high taxes) they defaulted on payments. This caused the value of MBS securities to crash. [Did this also cause the debt crisis in European countries?] In the 1930s FDR's New Deal passed laws to prevent the swindling that preceded and caused the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Since the 1990s Congress repealed many of the New Deal laws that prevented frauds. Novel financial products were created to swindle investors by hiding the risks. That can't go on forever, and there was a day of reckoning. Overvalued securities plummeted down to their true value and wiped out many investors.

In the argot of the industry, the bank has an enormous ""value at risk"".  However, it only came to this understanding by accident.  A ""down-sized"" employee stumbles upon the problem and leaves it to a 28 year old ""rocket scientist"" to finish his work.The bank is shocked to its core.  It drags its board together in the dead of night to consider its options.  In fact, there is really only one.  Namely, the bank's huge position will have to be cut the following day and damn the consequences.This is a tightly scripted film with an excellent cast. Paul Bettany as the desk manager, Kevin Spacey as the dealing room's chief and Jeremy Irons as the bank's chairman are all excellent.  They have real street cred.

1458408,A3LKP6WPMP9UKX,B005FITIGO,Anna V. Carroll,"[8, 8]","I cannot believe the reviewers who gave this sharp, crisp film one star saw the same movie I did! It kept my attention from beginning to end. And, contrary to comments that the film has 'only three stars,' it has a wide array of acting talent. All excellent.Maybe I loved the film because I live in NYC and have numerous friends on Wall Street. In the era of Bernie Madoff ANYTHING is possible down there!I have one bone to pick with the film and that is at the beginning when a fired executive (Stanley Tucci) is being escorted from his office by a guard to the lobby but finds time to hand a young trader (Zachary Quinto)something from his computer (in full view of the guard). This would never, ever happen! The guard would have intercepted it and reported this to the management. However, in the movie this is allowed to happen. Without this there would be no film!By the end of the work day numerous traders (big and small) have been fired. Those who remain go out after work to celebrate their good fortune. Quinto stays behind and works for hours on the project Tucci had been delving into. He finishes the project and is stunned by what he finds. He calls his friend Penn Badgley at the bar and asks that he and their superior, Paul Bettany, return to the office. It is now after Midnight.Kevin Spacey who looks more and more like Henry Kissinger these days plays their boss. Although playing his usual Mr. Grumpy role, the fact his beloved dog is dying softens his image a great deal. At least to the audience. A rather snarky Simon Baker plays a cold, uncaring, icewater-in-his-veins executive to a T. Everyone around him is falling by the wayside and those left are quaking in their boots worrying if they will be next. But not Mr. Cohen (Simon Baker). He never loses his cool. Ever.Long story short, what Quinto discovers sends shock-waves through the top brass. The top man, Jeremy Irons, flies in by helicopter to address the newly found info personally. Demi Moore has a small part as a token female executive. A role any actress of a certain age could have played.I won't reveal any more information about the story line because it will spoil the film for you. Margin Call is a very snappy film. The photography is wonderful. Manhattan is always ready for her close-up and looks beautiful at night from the executive's office windows. After the sad, gray days after 9-11 she lost a bit of her shine. However, she now has her moxy back and twinkles like the star she is.In one scene, Paul Bettany has to drive from Manhattan to Brooklyn to find Tucci. He remarks to his passenger, Badgley, ""I hate Brooklyn!"" I chuckled because in reality Mr. Bettany, his wife and children live happily in Brooklyn and they love it. It may even be his townhouse they use in the scene.The cast was excellent. The film, one hour and 47 minutes, went by quickly. No frame was wasted. For those young men and women out there who have Wall Street stars in their eyes, consider this film a warning of what life on Wall Street is really like.

1458411,A30TQET02FLSUX,B005FITIGO,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[2, 2]","MOVIE RATING:  5 stars (A)Just like the 2008 stock market crash, Margin Call (2011) seemingly came out of nowhere and surprised the hell out of me. When I first saw the trailer, this movie got on my radar and I anxiously awaited it's release. To my surprise, it ended up surpassing all of my other highly anticipated films from the Fall of 2011. This is simply one of the best films of 2011...or any year.Written and directed by J.C. Chandor, Margin Call is a stunning feature film debut. Chandor's screenplay is so sharply and intelligently written, that I immediately compared this film to Oscar winning scribe Aaron Sorkin's super smart The Social Network (2010). This movie is just as current, as relevant, and as snappy as that highly regarded film. I love both movies. They're both perfect in my eyes. Margin Call is the better ""sequel"" to the classic financial thriller Wall Street (1987). While I really like Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), Margin Call is a much better look at the current mindset of the moneymakers in today's stock market, as well as our overall culture.For many people, this movie won't appeal to them. It demands you to use your brain and look at the darker realities and motivations of investment banks and the people who work in that world. But for those willing to go on the Margin Call ride, and escape into it's point of view, it's a real thriller. I was on the edge of my seat the first time I saw the movie. It just zipped along and kept me fascinated to see what would happen next, even though I intuitively knew where it was gonna ultimately go. But the ensemble cast is so richly fleshed out in each of their roles, that all of the little details of this film had me. Having watched the movie 4 or 5 times now, I keep going back to it over and over because it holds my attention each time.Ensemble movies like Margin Call live or die with the chemistry and performances of their cast. Fortunately, Chandor has picked a brilliant cast that really came through here. It could be easy for each of these great actors to get lost in the overall story, but each and every single one of them sizzles in their few minutes on screen. There's not really a single protagonist or a single antagonist in this movie. And that's the whole point of the story. It's not black & white. One could argue that Kevin Spacey is the lead actor, but the same argument could be applied to Zachary Quinto. The story is told through the eyes of both, and they both bring some of their best work to it. Supporting actors Paul Bettany, Simon Baker, Jeremy Irons, Penn Badgley, Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci each bring fantastic supporting performances, embodying their characters perfectly in my mind. To a degree, they're all criminals and victims in the financial mess that they've created and participated in. And aren't we all really the same, in our own lives? The cause and cure of our successes and failures in life?The production values in Margin Call far outweigh the reported $3.4 million budget that it was made for. Chandor assembled a fantastic team that really brought their A-game to this project. Shot mostly on a Red One digital cinema camera, along with some footage shot on a Canon 5D and 35mm film, the cinematography by Frank G. DeMarco is beautifully saturated, well composed, and presents New York City as well as any film before it. I highly recommend you watch this movie on blu-ray to fully appreciate it.While the production design by John Paino might get overlooked, every detail of this claustrophobic movie is well executed. Supposedly, the interior building scenes were all shot on a single floor of this building, so the production design team did a great job reallocating space to serve multiple functions.Two of the most important aspects of this film are the music and the editing. They go hand in hand, like on most movies. Editor Pete Beaudreau cut this feature down to the bone, leaving just enough material to tell the story in an interesting way, but not too much to weigh it down. The tone and pace are spot on. The original music score by Nathan Larson is reminiscent of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' superb work on The Social Network. It has a buzzing, clicking and edgy beat to it, helping push forward the dialogue and ideas presented by the cast. It really brings an emotional core to the film that might not otherwise come through. It's a subtle emotional core, but there nonetheless. I also really enjoyed the vocal piece ""Wolves"" by Phosphorescent. It leant the perfect tone to the scene where actor Zachary Quinto discovers the problem with the complex financial equation.At its core, Margin Call is a small, handcrafted indie film catered to a niche audience. It does it's job perfectly. And if you're willing to get into this story and relate to the characters, I think you'll find the payoff that we all look for from our investments in movies.",5,The Worthy Sequel to Wall Street.

Going into this movie, which is based on a true story, I expected to be educated somewhat in Wall St. lingo and come away knowing what MBS (Mortgage backed securities) are and, how they ended up being integral in bringing down an entire industry. Sadly, I came away knowing as much as when I went in.The movie is slow paced and focus is liberally scattered between the key players. A day of firings, at the financial securities firm, sees one who is exiting hand over a thumb drive to an upcoming newer guy with the parting words ""Be careful"". The thumb drives holds a financial model that heralds the impending doom of the company due to overexposure in the MBS market. High level meetings figure it's time to start dumping those securities and a crazy day of selling worthless securities ensues.That's basically it. There are one or two points where the characters discuss the ethics surrounding the knowledge that they are indeed selling junk in an attempt to lower their own risk (Save their own a$$es). Buyer beware ? Who knows the games played on Wall St. But, take Wall St. out the picture and apply the same logic to any situation and ask yourself, what would YOU knowingly do to save your self?It's a cutthroat/competitive world and, in the world of high finance, I'm sure the scale of competitiveness has higher numbers on it.The movie is 1hr and 42 minutes and, seems to end way too abruptly. We don't get into the aftermath of the day of trading and the viewer is left wondering, ok, what was all that about?Personally, I feel this movie should have been longer. A summary of the mechanics of the MBS securities would have been very helpful along with at least 20 minutes spent showing us the aftermath of the day of trading. The constant overtone is impending doom on a grand scale yet, I wasn't sure why? It hadn't been explained to me why these men were so in fear for the world. I felt I didn't learn anything useful but, overall, I enjoyed the movie for the sake of the movie.Spacey, as always, is brilliant, Jeremy Irons, again, brilliant and the other cast members were as good as they needed to be. It's a somewhat dark movie and there is little, if any, lighter moments.3 stars is all I could muster despite the wealth of talent.

This begins a compelling drama based somewhat on the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.  To be clear, this is not a thriller and it's not a fictionalized retelling of the Lehman collapse.  It's a conventional drama.  And most of the story takes place in a single building.The film dramatizes what the executives did in the 24 hours after they realized they were sitting on billions in worthless assets. ""So, what you're telling me is that the music is about to stop and we're gonna be left holding the biggest bag of odorous excrement ever assembled in the history of capitalism.""  That's the big cheese played by Jeremy Irons. He concocts a scheme to dump the assets on unsuspecting buyers within a single business day. His underling opposes the idea. Kevin Spacey plays the underling and he's pretty awesome.People who liked ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", which was a film based on strong performances and sharp dialogue might like this film. Otherwise, the film might just look like a bunch of talking heads. The movie examines the behavior of people in a crisis and their motivations. The most memorable lines comes from Jeremy Irons: ""It's just money. It's made up. Just pieces of paper with pictures on it, so we don't have to kill each other to get something to eat.""

I just read it and it is a brilliant review, which I cannot hope to equal.  I must especially join him in saying I still really don't understand the finances behind the movie despite my having BA and JD degrees.  I took economics in college but i guess that isn't enough to really grasp finance. I think that maybe I heard them say one sentence at one point at having too many mortgages and the real estate wasn't worth the mortgages.  Well, that part I understood but the rest I did not. I guess you really do have to be a rocket scientist from MIT with a PhD, as is the young man with the company who figures it out.  He says both fields are all numbers so they really are not dissimilar in learning curves.This has an all star ensemble cast. They are all fine.  It is the screenplay that somehow is lacking.  If I compare this with a legal drama, the ones that work have a human component to them.  A big human component.  So being in the jury room with the TWELVE ANGRY MEN can fill you with dramatic tension.  You don't need to have a law degree to understand the human failings and strengths on display throughout.  That is missing here. Likewise, David Mamet's pulitzer prize winning Glengarry Glen Ross has a similar ensemble cast with similar motivations.  They are all salesmen for worthless land who mostly are losers because they are no longer closing.  Kevin Spacey was also in that film and you hated him.  This film is incapable of eliciting that kind of emotion from its audience.It tries in some spots to put in the human element and the closest the film comes is Kevin Spacey's dog's dying. There is a considerable drop off in the human equation apart from that event. There is a total absence of spouses and children, other than Spacey's ex-wife for just a few minutes, which makes it seem as if these characters have nothing in their lives but the company.  I suspect that was intended but again, it doesn't create dramatic tension based on human strengths and failings.",3,Amazon Reviewer Turfseer from NYC Nails It,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,2110,"['Amazon', 'Reviewer', 'Turfseer', 'listed', 'Amazon', 'best', 'critical', 'review', 'reviews', 'filed', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'just', 'read', 'brilliant', 'review', 'can', 'not', 'hope', 'equal', 'must', 'especially', 'join', 'saying', 'still', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'finances', 'movie', 'having', 'BA', 'JD', 'degrees', 'took', 'economics', 'college', 'i', 'guess', ""n't"", 'enough', 'really', 'grasp', 'finance', 'think', 'maybe', 'heard', 'say', 'one', 'sentence', 'one', 'point', 'having', 'too', 'many', 'mortgages', 'real', 'estate', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'mortgages', 'Well', 'part', 'understood', 'rest', 'did', 'not', 'guess', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'MIT', 'PhD', 'young', 'man', 'company', 'who', 'out', 'fields', 'are', 'numbers', 'really', 'are', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'learning', 'curves.This', 'star', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'are', 'fine', 'screenplay', 'somehow', 'lacking', 'compare', 'legal', 'drama', 'ones', 'work', 'have', 'human', 'component', 'big', 'human', 'component', 'So', 'being', 'jury', 'room', 'TWELVE', 'ANGRY', 'MEN', 'can', 'fill', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'law', 'degree', 'understand', 'human', 'failings', 'strengths', 'display', 'missing', 'here', 'Likewise', 'David', 'Mamet', 'pulitzer', 'prize', 'winning', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'similar', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'similar', 'motivations', 'are', 'salesmen', 'worthless', 'land', 'who', 'mostly', 'are', 'losers', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'closing', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'was', 'also', 'film', 'hated', 'film', 'incapable', 'eliciting', 'kind', 'emotion', 'audience.It', 'tries', 'spots', 'put', 'human', 'element', 'closest', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'dog', 'dying', 'considerable', 'drop', 'human', 'equation', 'apart', 'event', 'total', 'absence', 'spouses', 'children', 'other', 'Spacey', 'ex-wife', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'seem', 'characters', 'have', 'nothing', 'lives', 'company', 'suspect', 'was', 'intended', 'again', ""n't"", 'create', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'based', 'human', 'strengths', 'failings']",Margin Call

B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","The beginning chapters of the incredible collapse of the financial markets in the United States in 2007 and 2008 is a great choice for a film since it has the potential to humanize the great risks the large financial firms took as they purchased unsound mortgages, packaged them as securities, and sold them to their customer base. This film certainly humanizes this unsettling event in this country&#8217;s financial and economic history. However, as I watched the film I felt that the dialogue and actions of the actors may be beyond the comprehension of those who have little understanding of economics and finance or who did not pay much attention to the meltdown that was experienced in the final months of the George W Bush presidency and which stretched into the Obama presidency and required considerable funds to prop up the over-extended financial industry.I think the film made a wise choice to focus on the downsizing and layoffs that occur during these financial emergencies rather than go too far in depth regarding hedge funds, derivatives, and banks that are too big to fail. Instead the focus was placed upon the characters in an un-named financial firm and the impact of the economic crisis on the lives of these people. Heads do roll in this film and it was fascinating to see who survives and who goes when the going gets tough.Stanley Tucci plays an experienced risk manager whose economic model indicates there is considerable risk for the firm as it takes bundled unsafe mortgages and collateralizes them as securities. Since the process requires analysis of the risks of various bundles, the securities stay on the books for over 30 days, creating a considerable vulnerability should the market for these securities evaporate, which is exactly what happened in reality and in the film.Zachary Quinto plays the role of a bright PhD physicist with a specialty in propulsion who fits the pieces together after Tucci is laid off. Quinto&#8217;s character demonstrates that the rewards on wall street are so much greater than academia that some of the brightest minds are attracted to the oversized rewards that Wall Street offer.Demi Moore plays the role of a top executive in charge of risk management for the firm. It is ultimately her model that has been unable to predict that the firm is so over-committed to underwater mortgage-backed securities that the total potential loss exceeds the firm's total market capitalization value. She thinks that all those colleagues of hers in the top management tier will pay the price but her assumption proves wrong.Paul Bettany, Kevin Spacey, Simon Baker, and Jeremy Irons are the four exceptional actors who play the four layers of management at the firm, all of whom have various motivations for their work and perspective on the financial crisis. Young Penn Badgley is a 24 year old making $250,000 a year at an entry level job who has become obsessed with the corporate structure and the ever increasing financial rewards in this business.The financial crisis of 2007-2008 has much complexity but this film put one aspect of that crisis into human dimensions and thus is a very entertaining film.",4,The financial crisis of 2007-2008 presented in human scale,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,3164,"['beginning', 'chapters', 'incredible', 'collapse', 'financial', 'markets', 'United', 'States', '2007', '2008', 'great', 'choice', 'film', 'potential', 'humanize', 'great', 'risks', 'large', 'financial', 'firms', 'took', 'purchased', 'unsound', 'mortgages', 'packaged', 'securities', 'sold', 'customer', 'base', 'film', 'certainly', 'unsettling', 'event', 'country', '8217', 'financial', 'economic', 'history', 'However', 'watched', 'film', 'felt', 'dialogue', 'actions', 'actors', 'may', 'be', 'comprehension', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'understanding', 'economics', 'finance', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'meltdown', 'was', 'experienced', 'final', 'months', 'George', 'W', 'Bush', 'presidency', 'stretched', 'Obama', 'presidency', 'required', 'considerable', 'funds', 'prop', 'up', 'over-extended', 'financial', 'industry.I', 'think', 'film', 'made', 'wise', 'choice', 'focus', 'downsizing', 'layoffs', 'occur', 'financial', 'emergencies', 'rather', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'depth', 'regarding', 'hedge', 'funds', 'derivatives', 'banks', 'are', 'too', 'big', 'fail', 'Instead', 'focus', 'was', 'placed', 'characters', 'un-named', 'financial', 'firm', 'impact', 'economic', 'crisis', 'lives', 'people', 'Heads', 'do', 'roll', 'film', 'was', 'fascinating', 'see', 'who', 'who', 'when', 'going', 'tough.Stanley', 'Tucci', 'experienced', 'risk', 'manager', 'economic', 'model', 'indicates', 'considerable', 'risk', 'firm', 'bundled', 'unsafe', 'mortgages', 'securities', 'process', 'analysis', 'risks', 'various', 'bundles', 'securities', 'stay', 'books', '30', 'days', 'creating', 'considerable', 'vulnerability', 'should', 'market', 'securities', 'evaporate', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'reality', 'film.Zachary', 'Quinto', 'role', 'bright', 'PhD', 'physicist', 'specialty', 'propulsion', 'who', 'pieces', 'together', 'Tucci', 'laid', 'off', 'Quinto', '8217', 's', 'character', 'rewards', 'wall', 'street', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'greater', 'academia', 'brightest', 'minds', 'are', 'attracted', 'oversized', 'rewards', 'Wall', 'Street', 'offer.Demi', 'Moore', 'role', 'top', 'executive', 'charge', 'risk', 'management', 'firm', 'ultimately', 'model', 'been', 'unable', 'predict', 'firm', 'so', 'over-committed', 'underwater', 'mortgage-backed', 'securities', 'total', 'potential', 'loss', 'firm', 'total', 'market', 'capitalization', 'value', 'colleagues', 'hers', 'top', 'management', 'tier', 'will', 'pay', 'price', 'assumption', 'wrong.Paul', 'Bettany', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'are', 'four', 'exceptional', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'four', 'layers', 'management', 'firm', 'whom', 'have', 'various', 'motivations', 'work', 'perspective', 'financial', 'crisis', 'Young', 'Penn', 'Badgley', '24', 'year', 'old', 'making', '250,000', 'year', 'entry', 'level', 'job', 'who', 'become', 'obsessed', 'corporate', 'structure', 'ever', 'increasing', 'financial', 'rewards', 'business.The', 'financial', 'crisis', '2007-2008', 'much', 'complexity', 'film', 'put', 'one', 'aspect', 'crisis', 'human', 'dimensions', 'thus', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film']",Margin Call

All of the primary cast members deliver great dialogues (and monologues) regarding their privileged views of the rareified atmosphere they inhabit, and the inordinate amount of power they wield. Sam Rogers(Kevin Spacey) is the conscience of the movie, and the chief repository of what integrity his investment firm still possesses, represented both by his resistance to the planned actions, and by his deathly sick labrador.This is a smart movie that opens up and examines the attitudes of power-addicted organizations for a general audience.

It is based on the Lehman Brothers collapse but does not attempt to analyze it or even explain it in much detail.  In fact, it only covers about 36 hours of the meltdown.  This film is a work of dramatic fiction that follows a group of people who are facing the realization that their current prosperity is based on a house of cards and is about to undergo a ""correction"" that will fundamentally change their lives.  And the change will not come in weeks or months, but that very day.The point of the film is watching that group of people deal with the crisis on corporate and personal levels; often having to make some very unsavory choices.  The film's high quality comes from the script, which moves forward inexorably as the scope of the disaster becomes clear, and the fine group of actors, who deliver some excellent performances.  I would say there is only one false note in it: Paul Bettany teetering on edge; but I still consider his to be one of the standout performances.Some reviewers complain that the film is boring.  I have always been somewhat fascinated by Wall Street, so I cannot evaluate that claim.  When I saw it on pay-per-view I thought it was riveting.  In fact, when it was over I restarted it and watched it again.  But there is very little technical detail in the movie.

They operated on every level from people buying more house than they could afford (the main culprit), to politicians and banks facilitating and encouraging riskier and riskier financial endeavors.To keep the farce alive and running, Wall Street took the reins and ran with the money.  Everyone seemed happy as long as the money kept rolling in.  Though the financial underpinnings were never sound, things just kept rolling along.  Why rock the boat?This required a lot of looking the other way by political leaders and denial on the part o the general public.  No one should be surprised that the house of cards came tumbling down.This movie is about the beginnings of the crash (fictionalized) and how a financial tsunami begins.  This drama delivers some fine performances from Zachary Quinto, Demi Moore, Keven Spacey, Paul Bettany, and Jeremy Irons.  It gives faces and form to what could prove to be a financial Apocalypse that could leave the nation in ruins, only time will tell on that front.From a business standpoint we see the forces that drive the decisions to cut one's losses and take it on the chin, survival for survival's sake.We also see moral and ethical struggles which ultimately succumb to going along with the crowd, despite the consequences.The movie is a look at a small piece of a big puzzle, and the issues that it required the players to face, and their ultimate failure at dealing with them.What works for me about this movie is that it's a beginning of putting the great recession into context, and getting us to take a look in the mirror to see our part in all of this.The question is:  can we be honest with ourselves?",4,Taking us over the edge,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,1779,"['forces', 'took', 'nation', 'financial', 'edge', 'great', 'recession', 'are', 'more', 'complicated', 'human', 'greed', 'operated', 'level', 'people', 'buying', 'more', 'house', 'could', 'afford', 'main', 'culprit', 'politicians', 'banks', 'facilitating', 'encouraging', 'riskier', 'riskier', 'financial', 'endeavors.To', 'keep', 'farce', 'alive', 'running', 'Wall', 'Street', 'took', 'reins', 'ran', 'money', 'Everyone', 'seemed', 'happy', 'as', 'long', 'money', 'kept', 'rolling', 'financial', 'underpinnings', 'were', 'never', 'sound', 'things', 'just', 'kept', 'rolling', 'along', 'Why', 'rock', 'boat', 'required', 'lot', 'looking', 'other', 'way', 'political', 'leaders', 'denial', 'part', 'general', 'public', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'surprised', 'house', 'cards', 'came', 'tumbling', 'down.This', 'movie', 'beginnings', 'crash', 'fictionalized', 'how', 'financial', 'tsunami', 'drama', 'fine', 'performances', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Keven', 'Spacey', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'form', 'what', 'could', 'prove', 'be', 'financial', 'Apocalypse', 'could', 'leave', 'nation', 'ruins', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'business', 'standpoint', 'see', 'forces', 'drive', 'decisions', 'cut', 'one', 'losses', 'take', 'chin', 'survival', 'survival', 'sake.We', 'also', 'see', 'moral', 'ethical', 'struggles', 'ultimately', 'succumb', 'going', 'along', 'crowd', 'consequences.The', 'movie', 'look', 'small', 'piece', 'big', 'puzzle', 'issues', 'required', 'players', 'face', 'ultimate', 'failure', 'dealing', 'works', 'movie', 'beginning', 'putting', 'great', 'recession', 'context', 'getting', 'take', 'look', 'mirror', 'see', 'part', 'this.The', 'question', 'can', 'be', 'honest', 'ourselves']",Margin Call

Yoe ""Miami Dan""","[0, 1]","this is not an action film.  those who do not have at least a basic understanding of the U.S. capital markets will more than likely be bored and confused by it.  in other words, the average Obama voter should probably pass this one up and move on to the latest edition of ""Twilight"" or ""Hangover II"".what this film is, though, is a very interesting analysis of the events that took place at one (fictional) Wall Street brokerage firm in the hours leading up to the market's awakening to the fact that the loose lending practices that led to an over-inflated housing market, and eventually to the meltdown of the U.S. and world financial markets.  it focuses on one 24 hour period at one firm, and in the process gives a good thumbnail summary of how the market collapse began.  it is also a fascinating study in human behavior and what drove people to foist what they knew to be worthless paper that spread through our economy like a cancer on unsuspecting buyers throughout the markets. I thought it was a great film, at least as far as it goes in telling the story.  but although I liked the movie and give it 5 stars, it focuses only on one small part of the story - the part that happened AFTER all the damage had already been done.what's missing is what led the lending institutions to make the bad mortgage loans to begin with. does anyone seriously believe that ""greed"" led mortgage lenders, who had been successfully making and collecting on mortgage loans for 100 years, suddenly begin to loan money to people who never had any intention of paying it back? please. be serious. what's missing is the role that corrupt politicians, mostly Democrats, played in creating the legislation that allowed them to essentially force the mortgage industry into making what they knew at the time were bad loans. what's also missing is how those corrupt politicians (e.g., Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Maxine Waters, etc.) continued to exert pressure on lenders and insist there were no problems at Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, even AFTER they knew there was a huge problem. in addition to the federal government's role, farm teams of the Democrat Party, such as ACORN, were instrumental in using racial blackmail to influence loose mortgage lending policies. neither is there any mention of the role of Obama, who contributed to this mess both in his pre-Senate days as a shady lawyer for ACORN, and then after he was elected to the Senate as a co-conspirator with the rest of his Democrat colleagues. Wall Street has dirty hands to be sure and ""Margin Call"" does an excellent job of explaining how they got their hands dirty, but they didn't start the mess, and they're certainly not alone. There are no good guys in this story. only criminals and cowards.  The actions and inactions of Obama and most others in the Congress qualify them as both.I thought this film was very interesting in presenting the thought process that led the Wall Street firms and their employees to make the cowardly decisions they did (in fairness, though, how many among us would have had the courage to walk away from millions of dollars for a few hours work when the alternative was personal financial armageddon and the house of cards was going to come down anyway?), but the movie completely gives a pass to - or, more accurately, completely ignores the role played by - the people who are ultimately accountable for this disaster - the criminals sitting in the Congress and the White House in Washington, D.C., and staffing the offices of groups like ACORN around the country. they are the ones who ultimately brought hell down on our economy. and they're still doing it.",5,Fascinating study of both human behavior and the 2008 meltdown,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,3646,"['not', 'action', 'film', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'least', 'basic', 'understanding', 'U.S.', 'capital', 'markets', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'bored', 'confused', 'other', 'words', 'average', 'Obama', 'voter', 'should', 'probably', 'pass', 'one', 'up', 'move', 'latest', 'edition', 'Twilight', 'Hangover', 'II', 'film', 'though', 'very', 'interesting', 'analysis', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'one', 'fictional', 'Wall', 'Street', 'brokerage', 'firm', 'hours', 'leading', 'up', 'market', 'awakening', 'fact', 'loose', 'lending', 'practices', 'led', 'over-inflated', 'housing', 'market', 'eventually', 'meltdown', 'U.S.', 'world', 'financial', 'markets', 'one', '24', 'hour', 'period', 'one', 'firm', 'process', 'good', 'thumbnail', 'summary', 'how', 'market', 'collapse', 'began', 'also', 'fascinating', 'study', 'human', 'behavior', 'what', 'drove', 'people', 'foist', 'what', 'knew', 'be', 'worthless', 'paper', 'spread', 'economy', 'cancer', 'unsuspecting', 'buyers', 'markets', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'telling', 'story', 'liked', 'movie', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'only', 'one', 'small', 'part', 'story', 'part', 'happened', 'AFTER', 'damage', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'done.what', 'missing', 'led', 'lending', 'institutions', 'make', 'bad', 'mortgage', 'loans', 'begin', 'anyone', 'seriously', 'believe', 'greed', 'led', 'mortgage', 'lenders', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'successfully', 'making', 'collecting', 'mortgage', 'loans', '100', 'years', 'suddenly', 'begin', 'loan', 'money', 'people', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'intention', 'paying', 'back', 'please', 'be', 'serious', 'what', 'missing', 'role', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'mostly', 'Democrats', 'played', 'creating', 'legislation', 'allowed', 'essentially', 'force', 'mortgage', 'industry', 'making', 'what', 'knew', 'time', 'were', 'bad', 'loans', 'what', 'also', 'missing', 'how', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'e.g.', 'Barney', 'Frank', 'Chris', 'Dodd', 'Maxine', 'Waters', 'etc', 'continued', 'exert', 'pressure', 'lenders', 'insist', 'were', 'problems', 'Fannie', 'Mae', 'Freddie', 'Mac', 'even', 'AFTER', 'knew', 'was', 'huge', 'problem', 'addition', 'federal', 'government', 'role', 'farm', 'teams', 'Democrat', 'Party', 'such', 'ACORN', 'were', 'instrumental', 'using', 'racial', 'blackmail', 'influence', 'loose', 'mortgage', 'lending', 'policies', 'there', 'mention', 'role', 'Obama', 'who', 'contributed', 'mess', 'pre-Senate', 'days', 'shady', 'lawyer', 'ACORN', 'then', 'was', 'elected', 'Senate', 'co-conspirator', 'rest', 'Democrat', 'colleagues', 'Wall', 'Street', 'dirty', 'hands', 'be', 'sure', 'Margin', 'Call', 'excellent', 'job', 'explaining', 'how', 'got', 'hands', 'dirty', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'mess', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'not', 'alone', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'story', 'only', 'criminals', 'cowards', 'actions', 'inactions', 'Obama', 'most', 'others', 'Congress', 'qualify', 'both.I', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'presenting', 'thought', 'process', 'led', 'Wall', 'Street', 'firms', 'employees', 'make', 'cowardly', 'decisions', 'did', 'fairness', 'though', 'how', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'courage', 'walk', 'away', 'millions', 'dollars', 'few', 'hours', 'work', 'when', 'alternative', 'was', 'personal', 'financial', 'armageddon', 'house', 'cards', 'was', 'going', 'come', 'down', 'anyway', 'movie', 'completely', 'pass', 'more', 'accurately', 'completely', 'role', 'played', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'ultimately', 'accountable', 'disaster', 'criminals', 'sitting', 'Congress', 'White', 'House', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'staffing', 'offices', 'groups', 'ACORN', 'country', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'ultimately', 'brought', 'hell', 'down', 'economy', ""'re"", 'still', 'doing']",Margin Call

It is a well-written, taut thriller that has excellent performances all around.  Kevin Spacey turns in an outstanding performance as Sam Rogers, a company man who gradually lets go of all his illusions of being decent for money.  Zachary Quinto is excellent as Peter Sullivan who picks up where Stanly Tucci's character (Eric Dale) left off when he was a victim of downsizing.  Sullivan is more of an idealist and plays off his money-obsessed friend Seth Bregman (played by Penn Badgley) nicely.  Bregman knows the big bucks that the higher ups in the company and making and constantly astonishes Sullivan with what he knows.As news of the company's mortgage backed security problems grows, people higher up in the company make an appearance, some flying in by helicopter. Jeremy Irons is excellent as John Tuld, the companies CEO, as he admits that he needs the problem explained to him in plain English but controls the situation coolly. Paul Bettany is excellent as Will Emerson, a somewhat burned out salesman who doesn't seem to care about the money but rises to the occasion to unload worthless investments on the unwary.  Demi Moore has a good part as a Risk Management officer - the lone female officer - who is in trouble following the revelation about the company's position. Her character coolly accepts what is going on and as the only woman; she knows that she is not one of the ""players.""  Simon Baker's character (Jared Cohen) is definitely a player and he presents a ruthless exterior perfectly.Sullivan and Dale show an interesting side of their characters as opposed to the others in that they came from other backgrounds into finance.  Sullivan is a rocket scientist and Dale has a long monologue about how he built a bridge and save the local residents thousands of hours by shortening their daily commute.Margin call is a film that grabs your interest from the start and doesn't let go. It provides an interesting commentary on the financial meltdown.  Of all the excellent performances in this film, Kevin Spacey remains for me a standout as his character faces a moral decision to let the company he has worked for fail or unload worthless financial products. In the end, the choice his character makes is the one the one that Wall Street made and would make again; save yourself and let someone else clean up the mess.",5,A Movie For Our Times,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,2458,"['Margin', 'Call', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'message', 'as', 'current', 'front', 'page', 'well-written', 'taut', 'thriller', 'excellent', 'performances', 'around', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Rogers', 'company', 'man', 'who', 'gradually', 'go', 'illusions', 'being', 'decent', 'money', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'excellent', 'Peter', 'Sullivan', 'who', 'up', 'where', 'Stanly', 'Tucci', 'character', 'Eric', 'Dale', 'left', 'off', 'when', 'was', 'victim', 'downsizing', 'Sullivan', 'more', 'idealist', 'off', 'money-obsessed', 'friend', 'Seth', 'Bregman', 'played', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'nicely', 'Bregman', 'big', 'bucks', 'higher', 'ups', 'company', 'making', 'constantly', 'astonishes', 'Sullivan', 'what', 'knows.As', 'news', 'company', 'mortgage', 'backed', 'security', 'problems', 'people', 'higher', 'up', 'company', 'make', 'appearance', 'flying', 'helicopter', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'excellent', 'John', 'Tuld', 'companies', 'CEO', 'problem', 'explained', 'plain', 'English', 'situation', 'coolly', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'excellent', 'Will', 'Emerson', 'somewhat', 'burned', 'out', 'salesman', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'money', 'occasion', 'unload', 'worthless', 'investments', 'unwary', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'good', 'part', 'Risk', 'Management', 'officer', 'lone', 'female', 'officer', 'who', 'trouble', 'following', 'revelation', 'company', 'position', 'character', 'coolly', 'what', 'going', 'only', 'woman', 'not', 'one', 'players', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'character', 'Jared', 'Cohen', 'definitely', 'player', 'ruthless', 'exterior', 'perfectly.Sullivan', 'Dale', 'show', 'interesting', 'side', 'characters', 'opposed', 'others', 'came', 'other', 'backgrounds', 'finance', 'Sullivan', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'Dale', 'long', 'monologue', 'how', 'built', 'bridge', 'save', 'local', 'residents', 'thousands', 'hours', 'shortening', 'daily', 'commute.Margin', 'call', 'film', 'interest', 'start', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'financial', 'meltdown', 'excellent', 'performances', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'standout', 'character', 'moral', 'decision', 'let', 'company', 'worked', 'fail', 'unload', 'worthless', 'financial', 'products', 'end', 'choice', 'character', 'one', 'one', 'Wall', 'Street', 'made', 'would', 'make', 'again', 'save', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'up', 'mess']",Margin Call

The dialog is outstanding. Very interesting watching upper management only care about the company and themselves. The continued success and ""got mine"" of those in charge, or supplied with wonderful parachute type packages is semi shocking and norm for upper management officers. Our economic disaster of 2008-2010 is presented in its most naked form via this film as to USA corporate banks. They/we bundled mortgage related products with lower ratings B, BB, BBB, A or even C ratings, coupled with a mathmatical formula the said the odds of them all failing was nearly impossible. So the products got AAA ratings by Moodys and S&P; !!!!. Then the banking firms sold trillions to each other, who then borrowed trillions from other firms using these AAA rated products as collaterical.. Then the products freaking failed as housing collapased/jobs lost and people could not pay their mortgages!!!!!!!!!!!!!We damn near destroyed the entire economic world....Gotta love this film although skirts the true harm of what we did. But presents a fantastic insight into how the corporate profit at all cost world really works; Got Mine, Keep My Job, Make Money, hope I am not fired..... And as you get older (like me), you pray, you can keep your health care benefits LOL..... I watched it twice over a week. A first for me, and even enjoyed it a little more the 2nd time.

1458443,A391RY3TA1MCVM,B005FITIGO,David Ljunggren,"[0, 1]","Don`t be fooled by the reviews -- this is a good film about the 2008 Wall Street crash, not a great one. The main challenge for the director is that he has to keep us engaged even though much of the audience will surely delight in watching a bunch of greedy financial operators try desperately to avoid a meltdown of their firm which was caused by their love of money and disregard for the risks. The problem here is that none of the characters are particularly likeable or so horrifically over-the-top as to be mesmerising. Instead we have a mixture of innocent youth combined with clapped out bosses with a few cynical high-level people flitting through the action. The movie starts strongly -- a young analyst discovers the firm is about to go bankrupt, sparking a series of panicked meetings through the night -- and speeds towards the tipping point. Are the bosses going to take a risk by keeping some very risky assets on board, or are they going to get rid of them in a fire sale, even though this will wreck the firm`s reputation? Without giving too much away, we don`t really care, since we have so little invested in the actors we`re watching. Kevin Spacey does what he can with a script which portrays him as a good-hearted almost honest boss with a weak character and a need for money, yet it isn`t enough. Jeremy Irons half convinces as the chairman, a cynical old Brit who doesn`t give two figs for tradition or what`s right. At the end he and Spacey have an unconvincing discussion about the nature of markets and how even if you started from scratch, the losers and winners would quickly rise to prominence. It doesn`t feel realistic and helps produce a very flat ending.

Allen,"[0, 3]","""Margin Call"" (2011) is a role model for making good money (for some, not all) from a low budget quickie movieI gave the movie a ""2 out of 5"" rating, which was charitable. Great or even good art, this was not.That stated, the financial venture part of the movie's history (reported in a Wikipedia article about the movie) is worth a close look.The project was cleverly executed, done quickly for a roughly $3 million dollar budget, and made 5 times that much (roughly $16 million dollars) by the time was finished being shown in movie houses.The movie is clever....tricky is also a good word to describe it.It features very famous and skilled actors and was shot in one location mostly in roughly one month (July 2010) in New York City, mostly.The famous actors part of the movie included Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons (both Best Actor Academy Award Winners), Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci.All heavyweights, all actors probably paid a lot of money up front from the $3 Million dollar budget, which otherwise was done on shoestring money remarked on repeatedly and continually by the director, Mr. J. C. Chandor, during the interesting and worth listening to ""director's commentary"" special feature part of the movie available in the DVD home version.The project was thrifty in ways movies can be and have been often in the past. This meant six figure figures (maybe large six figure figures) could be paid up front to Spacey, Irons, Moore, and Tucci.Everybody else probably got peanuts and glory, and maybe deferred payment agreements (which when honored were likely good.....those paid in deferred money had roughly $13 million dollars to divide at least part of).What was the result which turned a profit of roughly $13 million dollars for $3 million dollar up front investment?Well........the movie did the ""Curse Of The Cat People"" (1943) thing of being a film noir type movie with the ""unknown monster in the closet"" dangled through most of the movie ....and dangled skillfully by expert actor danglers (Spacey, Irons, Tucci, Moore).It took advantage of the fact most people don't understand Wall Street and big banker gobble-dee-gook terminology, and presented a corporate crisis meltdown scenario where the reason the corporation of ""suits"" faced bad times was never clearly explained....in spite of the (cynical) repeated phrase ""explain that to me in plain English"" (never really done) when the ""what's the problem?"" question is asked and answered.The audience never has the question answered of why there is ""trouble in River City with a capital 'T'."" ""MBS's"" (mortgage based securities) are mentioned in passing, always as an initial-ism.""MBS's"" are reported as the reason Lehman Bros. and Bear Sterns went under in 2008, and Goldman Sachs survived somehow.But not in this movie......the Wikipedia ""Margin Call Movie"" article mentions it briefly.People who don't check the Wikipedia description don't learn that.Viewers just learn the company is in trouble and people have to stay up several days and nights in a row facing terrible threats possibly disastrous.These people are all rich (big money incomes are mentioned repeatedly in the script), so they face losing a lot and that is, for dramatic purposes, more tragic than, say, an entire group in a MacDonald's hamburger stand location employees and managers facing loss of income and unemployment.The fact this is the message of the movie is part of the reason why I gave it low grades as a piece of art or valuable script writing.This movie is all about style and technique (delivered well by the big money actors well showcased in the simple film noir show presented), and piggybacking onto the headlines people don't understand about ""Wall Street In Trouble"" (esp. the 2008 crisis widely headlined and reported, never explained well anywhere.......every try to read the book titled ""Too Big To Fail"" (2010) by Andrew Sorkin about it all? Good luck to you!).""Margin Call"" (2011) is the movie equivalent to an avant Gard stage play presented on a bare stage with a black velvet background curtain, four fold-up chairs, an a hanging light-bulb where very good actors present a story showing they are all in trouble, and act, skillfully, in troubled ways saying troubled things.""No Exit"" by Jean Paul Sartre (done often by college drama depts. looking for drama without big stage design and costume bills) is an example of this kind of animal.Well.......""Margin Call"" (2011) made a lot of money relative to it's investment ($13 million dollars profit after repaying an initial investment of $3 million).Not bad.The movie itself is no big deal, even with the heavyweight actors part of it.....it's like the old joke about Chinese restaurants, and being hungry half an hour after you eat in one.It's not satisfying and it's not substantial, and people who label it with 5 stars (very many where it is reviewed by the hundreds who took time to do that) have low standards.But so what?These are times of low standards, and democracy in movie reviewing is urged on us by the likes of Amazon.Com and it's wholly owned subsidiary website, IMDb.Com.People with low standards buy things, and that includes doubtful movies like ""Margin Call"" (2011).Meanwhile, Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci get paid enough to continue living the good life of rich movie stars, and only a tiny percentage of movies any of them work in are truly good movies.---------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG movie actor.

Still, I was confused by the tradingspeak on which the events depicted in this movie depend. Paradoxically, the plot about the dire meltdown emergency and the based-on-true company's ""survival"" response was so plodding that I noticed several times that I was bored with it.It started out promising enough, with heads being surgically chopped off by the greedy, ruthless corporate axe. We get a palpable glimpse into the high-stress world of Wall Street trading as well as its utter emptiness. Back-stabbing and ironies abound, and some pictures are worth a thousand words&mdash;like the honcho coming in to shave in the company bathroom in the pre-dawn hours before the sell-off where the underling trader, who has been loudly weeping in a stall, tries to put on the emblematic wooden professional mask while being inhumanely ignored. But the sell-off happens too quickly for its scope and devastation to be appreciated, and the consequences to the global financial system and the ""little people"" of Main Street go unexplored.I did get a clue as to why real-world traders at post-bailout financial institutions were paid outrageous bonuses for failure. This did not elicit any sympathy on my part for the traders, however, because this movie makes it clear that generosity on the part of ""Mac the Knife"" corporate heads and the honoring of commitments to employees are nonexistent on Wall Street. (On the contrary, this solidified my sense that, in the real world, they are all in-cahoots greedy bastards.)When the pivot point in the movie arrives, and we are ready for some retrospective analysis, it abruptly ends. This left me feeling like a bucket of cold water had been poured over my head. Was that the point? Kevin Spacey, as always, delivers, but the ending was just plain weird. What was that?

The script is awful. The acting is atrocious in most cases (Jeremy Irons is pathetically mannered, Demi Moore has to be seen to be believed but Kevin Spacy is OK, in spite of the dreadful part), the editing often poor and the pace absolutely deadly. The simplification of the crisis is understandable, if only not to baffle the general public who are unfamiliar with the jargon of the milieu but it has been dummied down to moronic level.

1458452,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B005FITIGO,Ed Uyeshima,"[195, 210]","Having been the victim of corporate downsizing more than once, I was immediately engaged with this propulsive 2011 corporate drama from the beginning as Stanley Tucci's character, a seasoned risk management executive named Eric Dale, is told in a coldly indifferent manner that he is being laid off after 19 years with the same unnamed Wall Street firm. It's a piercing yet dramatically economical scene that perfectly summarizes how bloodless the corporate world can be, and in first-time writer/director J.C. Chandor's effort set on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis, it is very cold indeed with 80% of the trading floor being let go. As Dale is escorted out of the building, he hands a flash drive to his prodigious assistant Peter Sullivan and tells him to take a look at it and ""Be careful.""Once Sullivan analyzes the data, he realizes the universal gravity of Dale's warning - that the firm is so over-committed to underwater mortgage-backed securities that the total potential loss exceeds the firm's total market capitalization value. In other words, the projected scenario means the firm will soon owe a lot more than it's worth, and the market will be on the verge of an apocalyptic meltdown. What happens after this discovery is a series of sharply intense clandestine confrontations with each level of higher-ups recognizing the ramifications of the inevitable disaster, each one far more nuanced in character than we are used to seeing in films from Oliver Stone about greed and immorality. Blessedly, Chandor doesn't stoop to the customary stereotypes in this corporate cage match, but what he does manage is capture the moral compass underneath each player by way of a cast that really delivers the goods with powerfully implosive performances.Zachary Quinto (Star Trek) is initially at the center of the plot as Sullivan and performs well enough in the constraining, semi-heroic role, but the veterans really stand out here beginning with Kevin Spacey, who effectively plays against type as Sam Rogers, a genuine company man, the seen-it-all head of the trading team who rallies what's left of the trading floor with corporate brio but then faces his own cross to bear struggling to commandeer a fire sale of worthless assets dumped on unsuspecting clients. The other standout is Jeremy Irons, who masterfully resuscitates the cool cunning of his Claus von Bulow fromReversal of Fortuneas the acerbically survivalist CEO John Tuld. He handily controls the boardroom scene with cutting humor and hostile precision. One of the film's more pleasant surprises is Demi Moore in cool, brisk form as Sarah Robertson, the top risk officer and lone female executive who knows her career is at stake with the discovery of this folly. Tucci is excellent in his smallish role as Dale and gets to show off his resigned character's engineering aptitude with a brief monologue about building a bridge.Comparatively less impressive but playing their more predictable roles fitfully are Penn Badgley as Sullivan's younger, overtly money-obsessed colleague Seth Bregman; Paul Bettany as Dale's nihilistic, snake-oil salesman of a boss, Will Emerson; and Simon Baker as the most morally despicable executive of the bunch, Jared Cohen. Mary McDonnell has a brief and frankly unnecessary scene as Rogers' ex-wife, and I didn't even recognize the usually hilarious Broadway personality Susan Blackwell as the hatchet woman in the opening scene. There are a few flaws with Chandor's observant screenplay, for example, the overly analogous scenes of Rogers dealing with his dying dog and a rooftop scene that plays up Emerson's nihilistic nature too predictably. In addition, some scenes play either too murkily or too clinically to achieve the precise dramatic effect they should. I think the absence of a musical score also contributes to the sterility of the proceedings. However, as a first-time filmmaker, Chandor more than impresses with his deft handling of such a zeitgeist moment with the Occupy Wall Street protests gaining understandable momentum right now.",4,First-Time Filmmaker Deftly Handles the Financial Meltdown on Human-Size Terms,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,4063,"['Having', 'been', 'victim', 'corporate', 'downsizing', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'immediately', 'engaged', 'propulsive', '2011', 'corporate', 'drama', 'beginning', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'character', 'seasoned', 'risk', 'management', 'executive', 'named', 'Eric', 'Dale', 'told', 'coldly', 'indifferent', 'manner', 'being', 'laid', 'off', '19', 'years', 'same', 'unnamed', 'Wall', 'Street', 'firm', 'piercing', 'yet', 'dramatically', 'economical', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'how', 'bloodless', 'corporate', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'first-time', 'writer/director', 'J.C.', 'Chandor', 'effort', 'set', 'eve', '2008', 'financial', 'crisis', 'very', 'cold', 'indeed', '80', '%', 'trading', 'floor', 'being', 'let', 'go', 'Dale', 'escorted', 'building', 'flash', 'drive', 'prodigious', 'assistant', 'Peter', 'Sullivan', 'take', 'look', 'Be', 'careful', 'Once', 'Sullivan', 'data', 'universal', 'gravity', 'Dale', 'warning', 'firm', 'so', 'over-committed', 'underwater', 'mortgage-backed', 'securities', 'total', 'potential', 'loss', 'firm', 'total', 'market', 'capitalization', 'value', 'other', 'words', 'projected', 'scenario', 'firm', 'will', 'soon', 'owe', 'lot', 'more', 'worth', 'market', 'will', 'be', 'verge', 'apocalyptic', 'meltdown', 'What', 'discovery', 'series', 'sharply', 'intense', 'clandestine', 'confrontations', 'level', 'higher-ups', 'recognizing', 'ramifications', 'inevitable', 'disaster', 'one', 'far', 'more', 'nuanced', 'character', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'films', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'greed', 'immorality', 'Blessedly', 'Chandor', ""n't"", 'stoop', 'customary', 'stereotypes', 'corporate', 'cage', 'match', 'what', 'manage', 'capture', 'moral', 'compass', 'player', 'way', 'cast', 'really', 'goods', 'powerfully', 'implosive', 'performances.Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Star', 'Trek', 'initially', 'center', 'plot', 'Sullivan', 'performs', 'well', 'enough', 'constraining', 'semi-heroic', 'role', 'veterans', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'here', 'beginning', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'effectively', 'type', 'Sam', 'Rogers', 'genuine', 'company', 'man', 'seen-it-all', 'head', 'trading', 'team', 'who', 'what', 'left', 'trading', 'floor', 'corporate', 'brio', 'then', 'own', 'cross', 'bear', 'struggling', 'commandeer', 'fire', 'sale', 'worthless', 'assets', 'dumped', 'unsuspecting', 'clients', 'other', 'standout', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'who', 'masterfully', 'cool', 'cunning', 'Claus', 'von', 'Bulow', 'fromReversal', 'Fortuneas', 'acerbically', 'survivalist', 'CEO', 'John', 'Tuld', 'handily', 'boardroom', 'scene', 'cutting', 'humor', 'hostile', 'precision', 'One', 'film', 'more', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'cool', 'brisk', 'form', 'Sarah', 'Robertson', 'top', 'risk', 'officer', 'lone', 'female', 'executive', 'who', 'career', 'stake', 'discovery', 'folly', 'Tucci', 'excellent', 'smallish', 'role', 'Dale', 'show', 'off', 'resigned', 'character', 'engineering', 'aptitude', 'brief', 'monologue', 'building', 'bridge.Comparatively', 'less', 'impressive', 'playing', 'more', 'predictable', 'roles', 'fitfully', 'are', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'Sullivan', 'younger', 'overtly', 'money-obsessed', 'colleague', 'Seth', 'Bregman', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Dale', 'nihilistic', 'snake-oil', 'salesman', 'boss', 'Will', 'Emerson', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'most', 'morally', 'despicable', 'executive', 'bunch', 'Jared', 'Cohen', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'brief', 'frankly', 'unnecessary', 'scene', 'Rogers', 'ex-wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'usually', 'hilarious', 'Broadway', 'personality', 'Susan', 'Blackwell', 'hatchet', 'woman', 'opening', 'scene', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'Chandor', 'observant', 'screenplay', 'example', 'overly', 'analogous', 'scenes', 'Rogers', 'dealing', 'dying', 'dog', 'rooftop', 'scene', 'up', 'Emerson', 'nihilistic', 'nature', 'too', 'predictably', 'addition', 'scenes', 'play', 'either', 'too', 'murkily', 'too', 'clinically', 'achieve', 'precise', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'should', 'think', 'absence', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'sterility', 'proceedings', 'However', 'first-time', 'filmmaker', 'Chandor', 'more', 'impresses', 'deft', 'handling', 'such', 'zeitgeist', 'moment', 'Occupy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'protests', 'gaining', 'understandable', 'momentum', 'right', 'now']",Margin Call

It is the American way, the American way of business. It is the way of handing people their pink slip. It's an assembly line that is efficient  and cold. It is a human slaughterhouse in action.That is how this film starts, a man is being laid off after so many years. The Human Resources executive doesn't have a sympathetic ear, a kind word, or even a warm smile.  When the victim (played by Stanley Tucci), tells her that there is some important project he was completing, she dismisses his concern. His message could be that she is on a sinking ship and she doesn't know the gravity of her own situation. In fact, that is what he was indirectly trying to tell her. He could only tell it to a now former colleague to whom he passes a jump drive, just before the elevator door closes on him and his career.By early evening the colleague installs the drive and looks at his work.  The numbers don't lie. The company is on the verge of imminent financial disaster. He makes a call summoning people back to work which eventually reaches up the entire chain of command to the C.E.O. It is now late at night, and decisions have to be made, decisions that will bankrupt the firm or sucker other investors to ensure the company's survival.A number of characters come into play here, the one who is fired, the ones who will be fired, the one who will be blamed, the one who will make the decision, and the one who will abide by it because--he needs the money.This suspenseful film takes place over the course of one day, from morning to morning. What makes it work besides a fine cast is that you are pretty certain you know the outcome, but you, and forgive me for saying so, don't want to ""buy"" the outcome.You can hedge your bet that you will be entertained, but perhaps not in a pleasing way. This film is a dose of reality in the way business is conducted. It is ruthless, heartless and is only interested in Profit Resources, not Human Resources. It shows that these people can be robbers, eager to pull the trigger on loyal employees or investors who trusted them. The firm may give knowledgeable people a chilling reminder of Goldman Sachs, and how they treated their investors.Zachary Quinto, Kevin Spacey, Paul Bethany, Demi Moore, and Jeremy Irons are the cast that makes the financial meltdown of 2008 a taut thriller under the direction of J. C. Chandler.

They don't talk about technical details, only the emotions acted out in the actors' faces and dialogue as one might imagine on real executives' faces when the ""big one"" comes.Most recent jaw-dropping Wall Street debacle I kept thinking of, as I was watching this movie, was what happened to Knight Capital Group (KCG). This financial firm lost about $400 Million in about 20 minutes due to a software glitch that spent several billion dollars meant to be spread over several months in less than half an hour. Its share value collapsed. It still hasn't recovered as of writing this review.What might have gone through the faces of people in KCG? This movie gives a glimpse of what might have happened: Nothing to those at the highest level, played by Irons, who asks a younger analyst to tell him what is going on as if he was ""a child or a dog"". Irons plays a character of hard cold emotions oblivious to what happens to many, but in need of the loyalty and even affection of the few--suggesting a marginal glow of emotion.Just below him is a colder and utterly emotionless positional leader played by Baker, who is best known as the Mentalist. His character is meant to eclipse whatever emotion the higher up might have. And below him the leader of the smart worker bees. This role, the most demanding, is played by Spacey masterfully: displaying the dichotomy of being emotional and not. The push and pull of wanting something and not. The resistance creates an internal hurricane not many actors can pull off, and make it look like he's not acting.At the lowest level are those whose emotions are not yet in check, controlled, or eliminated altogether. What-if scenarios swirl in their minds into desperation and tears. But not for the character played by Quinto, who became famous in the TV show Heroes and the better made Star Trek movie. To say that he gets a promotion later would not give up anything about this story. The character is a prime candidate capable of ridding of all emotions like a Vulcan.The story makes a point of a distorted reality: money as an end. Yet we have learned from the best known distortionist of reality, Steve Jobs, that money should never be an end, but a means to create great products that people will want to buy. He proved that human resources of Apple can trump over the natural resources of Exxon. That last comment was in defense of capitalism.

Even though MARGIN CALL clearly and accurately presents the culture of a high stakes Wall Street investment organization, it does so haltingly. Each of the actors did an excellent job of presenting his or her character. However, missing was strong character dynamics ... or at least the changes were very subtle; and that is derived from the script rather than the considerable skills of Kevin  Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Demi Moore, Jeremy Irons, et al. Unlike certain analogous TV series such as THE GOOD WIFE, MARGIN CALL does not keep moving all the time. Although most of the time the story keeps the action going, occasionally the drama slows down and some times even seems contrived. Such as when the upper echelon of the firm waits on the roof of the sky scraper office building for arrival of the top man in his helicopter. One of the characters climbs over a fence staring down at the street dozens of stories below ... scaring his companions that the firm's financial crisis had made him contemplate suicide (a financial clich&eacute;).

Though the film is very well crafted and is populated with some of our finest actors it is an exceptionally disturbing look at greed and all its permutations. The only aspect of the film that makes it less devastating to watch is the manner in which the story is told - through the eyes of the people involved in the crisis and how it affects them as well as those they have financially and morally abused and destroyed.The film opens with the Investment Banking downsizing firing of Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), a veteran of 19 years with the firm who is on the brink of making a shattering discovery. His boss Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey) simply tells him he is through and has him escorted out of the building, cutting off all ties with the firm: Eric passes a file to one of his young co- workers, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) as he is exiting the building via the elevator stating 'Be Careful'. During the day many others are let go and informed of their separation packages. Tension builds as Peter downloads the information form Eric and discovers that the firm is on th brink of destruction form greedy overselling to clients: collapse seems imminent. It is now night and Peter calls his co-worker Seth (Penn Badgley) back to the office along with another boos Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) and as the situation terrifies them all they inform the Human Resources people Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) and Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore) who realize the gravity of the situation and ask the owner of the firm John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) to come to the firm in the middle of the night to inform him of the calamity. The only choice seems to be to sell out everything and close the company, an act that would further betray the clients of the firm and causes considerable conflict among the firm's staff. Everyone seems to trust Sam and will follow his advice as to go through with the questionable sell junk bonds to loyal clients in order to not collapse. Each of the people involved in the action has a personal fear, and Sam is particularly vulnerable because he has been informed his beloved dog is dying from a tumor (one of the few suggestions that these people may have a vulnerable aspect to their psyches. How the announcement is made and the actions taken as the sun comes up on this night of terror gives the audience a first hand look of that hideous moment in 2008 when the markets failed, injuring millions of people's lives.JC Chandor wrote and directed this film and offers an impressive debut - and a lot of courage bringing a film with this topic to the screens at this point in time. Many viewers may find that there is too little character development in this script, but consider the time frame of the film - less than 24 hours in one of the worst crises of this country - and realize that this may be a statement about the corporate personality: no matter the gravity of the result of crashing they think basically about their job stability. Every one in the cast is memorable, right up to the end of the film when we finally meet Mary McDonnell as Sam's ex-wife questioning Sam's digging a grave for his dog in his previous home's yard. It is a moment of agony that adds a smidgen of idea that the characters involved so indeed have souls.This is a very disturbing film about a very disturbing subject, made all the more disturbing by the fact that it forces us to look at an act the affected the lives of all of us.

But it really just kind of lays there. It builds tension nicely, but at the same time, there are no real stakes, so the tension dissipates. Yes, it is based on a huge Wall Street scandal that ruined our economy for years to come, but for the characters involved? Nothing really comes across as vital.Everyone is very matter of fact and drab about the looming crisis. Even when the company is on the brink of going under or when they are selling garbage to people they are knowingly ruining, it comes across as business as usual, which is kind of the point, but it just ends up seeming bland and unimportant. And the characters aren't very likeable, so we have no one to root for. Everyone is a sell-out or just an awful scum bag, so we have no point of reference for the audience and we never really care about anyone or their fate. Without the backdrop of recent history we wouldn't be able to tell just how truly slimy the characters are being. Again, that's kind of the point of the movie, but it really plays out poorly from a dramatic standpoint.Symbolism hammers you over the head with no subtlety to the point where it is insulting. Meanwhile, the dialogue is so industry specific that most movie goers will have no idea what they are talking about, even if they go in to the movie knowing the entire event the film is based on. I know this is how the characters would really talk, but there is just so much &#34;business-ese&#34; that it becomes tiresome. Even the expository scenes that are meant to inform the audience of the situation in plain English rely so heavily on metaphor and tech-talk that it's just as bad as having no exposition at all.This movie is well shot, well acted, and very smart, but it is more of a &#34;day at the office&#34; than a dramatic film.

A lot has changed since the time of the original 1987 ""Wall Street"" movie. Greed is still good and well, but there is no more charismatic Gordon Gekko trying to get ahead with stolen insider trading information. This is 2008, when most of the financial world is playing with fire; as financial ""products"" (mortgage backed securities, credit default swaps and extreme leveraging) with immense complexities create incredible profits, seemingly nobody knows exactly how the money flows from pockets to pockets. Nobody seems to understand the risks either, although there is a risk management team, everybody seems to be more annoyed with the signs of trouble than trying to heed the warning. In fact, the movie starts with the firing of one of the risk management analysts. Instead of Gordon Gekko there is only a seemingly clueless CEO, ""John Tuld"" (played superbly by Jeremy Irons). You may notice the name is slightly similar to Richard S. Fuld (Lehman Brothers).The story is well described in all the earlier previews. What is the most striking motif here is that while the traders do their job by selling and buying massive amount of money segments, only few brokers with background in mathematics, physics (rocket science) could grasp the concept of volatility associated with the process. In fact, the higher position is someone in management, the more the single whistle blower trader (""Peter Sullivan"" played by Zachary Quinto) has to dumb down the explanation of the problem in order to be understood. But the problem is about to wreak havoc and billions of dollars could disappear ending the existence of this fictional firm, as the meltdown and financial crisis of 2008 is about to explode.So time is money. The trading firm has to unload all of its toxic assets as fast as possible to make the most of the money while the rest of the financial world is still unaware of the disappearing value. Few points in sale price may mean 130 million dollar loss, yet the firm keeps unloading and liquidating its assets in a single day. This fire sale disregards any professionalism; a suicide mission that ignores friendship, trust, morals, the discount sale of worthless products means the acceptance of career ending loss of trust as well.The cast is excellent. But Kevin Spacey gives the most gripping characterization of all. Above the level of management where an outside firing squad in a day could destroy his career by asking him to pack his belongings, he is also below the level of management where he would be truly untouchable and wealthy, he is the only one with moral dilemma. While everyone is talking about profits, income, cars and strippers, he is concerned about his professional credibility. He worries abbout the firm. He worries about the employees. He worries about the financial world. He worries, because seemingly he is the only one who cares about something else or more than money. But he does what needs to be done; single handedly and with nerves of steel he commands the remaining traders to sell off the assets. He only breaks down at the very end of the movie, crying alone in the dark while he has to bury his beloved dog.An excellent movie it is in the spirit of ""Glengarry Glenn Ross"", ""Wall Street"" and ""Boiler Room"".",5,While we were sleeping...,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,3405,"['Most', 'movie', 'out', 'night', 'high', 'high', 'Street', 'one', 'typical', 'computer', 'screen', 'lit', 'fully', 'glass', 'windowed', 'trading', 'offices', 'lot', 'changed', 'time', 'original', '1987', 'Wall', 'Street', 'movie', 'Greed', 'still', 'good', 'well', 'more', 'charismatic', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'trying', 'get', 'ahead', 'stolen', 'insider', 'trading', 'information', '2008', 'when', 'most', 'financial', 'world', 'playing', 'fire', 'financial', 'products', 'mortgage', 'backed', 'securities', 'credit', 'default', 'swaps', 'extreme', 'leveraging', 'immense', 'complexities', 'create', 'incredible', 'profits', 'seemingly', 'nobody', 'exactly', 'how', 'money', 'pockets', 'pockets', 'Nobody', 'understand', 'risks', 'risk', 'management', 'team', 'everybody', 'be', 'more', 'annoyed', 'signs', 'trouble', 'trying', 'heed', 'warning', 'fact', 'movie', 'firing', 'one', 'risk', 'management', 'analysts', 'Instead', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'only', 'seemingly', 'clueless', 'CEO', 'John', 'Tuld', 'played', 'superbly', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'may', 'notice', 'name', 'slightly', 'similar', 'Richard', 'S.', 'Fuld', 'Lehman', 'Brothers', '.The', 'story', 'well', 'described', 'earlier', 'previews', 'What', 'most', 'striking', 'motif', 'here', 'traders', 'do', 'job', 'selling', 'buying', 'massive', 'amount', 'money', 'segments', 'only', 'few', 'brokers', 'background', 'mathematics', 'physics', 'rocket', 'science', 'could', 'grasp', 'concept', 'volatility', 'associated', 'process', 'fact', 'higher', 'position', 'someone', 'management', 'more', 'single', 'whistle', 'blower', 'trader', 'Peter', 'Sullivan', 'played', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'dumb', 'down', 'explanation', 'problem', 'order', 'be', 'understood', 'problem', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'billions', 'dollars', 'could', 'disappear', 'ending', 'existence', 'fictional', 'firm', 'meltdown', 'financial', 'crisis', '2008', 'explode.So', 'time', 'money', 'trading', 'firm', 'unload', 'toxic', 'assets', 'as', 'fast', 'possible', 'make', 'most', 'money', 'rest', 'financial', 'world', 'still', 'unaware', 'disappearing', 'value', 'Few', 'points', 'sale', 'price', 'may', 'mean', '130', 'million', 'dollar', 'loss', 'firm', 'unloading', 'liquidating', 'assets', 'single', 'day', 'fire', 'sale', 'disregards', 'professionalism', 'suicide', 'mission', 'friendship', 'trust', 'morals', 'discount', 'sale', 'worthless', 'products', 'acceptance', 'career', 'ending', 'loss', 'trust', 'well.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'most', 'gripping', 'characterization', 'level', 'management', 'where', 'outside', 'firing', 'squad', 'day', 'could', 'destroy', 'career', 'asking', 'pack', 'belongings', 'also', 'level', 'management', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'truly', 'untouchable', 'wealthy', 'only', 'one', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'everyone', 'talking', 'profits', 'income', 'cars', 'strippers', 'concerned', 'professional', 'credibility', 'firm', 'employees', 'financial', 'world', 'seemingly', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'something', 'else', 'more', 'money', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'single', 'handedly', 'nerves', 'steel', 'remaining', 'traders', 'sell', 'off', 'assets', 'only', 'down', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'crying', 'alone', 'dark', 'bury', 'beloved', 'dog.An', 'excellent', 'movie', 'spirit', 'Glengarry', 'Glenn', 'Ross', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Boiler', 'Room']",Margin Call

1458481,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B005FITIGO,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[4, 4]","That film is a pamphlet against an unregulated financial market and the story of that catastrophe that occurred in 2008 started after the 1929 crisis when Keynesian policies of all types were instated for individuals to buy on credit and even for the states to do the same. These policies have produced the credit crisis in Europe that we know now; Then in the 70s and 80s, especially with Reagan, and then when the Soviet bloc was out of the picture and no international competition was to be taken into account, we decided to get rid of all regulations on financial markets. Happy were the Chinese who recuperated Hong Kong in 1999 and kept a strict control over their financial markets.This deregulation of financial markets produced the subprime crisis that we know in 2008. But we have to keep in mind that we are all responsible because we elected the politicians we elected and we let them do anything and they on their side let the financiers do anything they wanted. And we know what happened and what we are still suffering because of it.The film does not concentrate on the horrific trauma the crisis is for the simple traders of the financial firm that is considered here. It concentrates on how the crisis can be managed by this firm who is happy to know before everyone else. They find out when the assistant sale manager who was just let go and who had devised a program to assess the financial situation of the firm, gives the USB key with it on his way out to the young rocket engineer who runs it and is able to project the present situation into the future. Too late boys and girls: in less than a week the whole financial Titanic hits rock bottom two miles under the iceberg.Within two days the truth must have come out, first day and first night, and then the problem must be solved to avoid bankruptcy and judicial lawsuits, second day. The boss then has to take a decision and it is simple. In the second day of this two day emergency 93% of all the spoiled assets must be sold, even at a loss. Better lose 20% than everything. And it has to be done by the traders who must be convinced to do it before the Stock Exchange closes in the afternoon.They are motivated with the announcement that they will all lose their jobs but that everyone who will reach the selling quota of 93% will get a more than one million premium, and if the department manages the same global quota, each trader will get an extra more than one million premium, nearly three millions all together. And they will do it, they will cut the branch on which they are sitting because of this nice little parachute or cushion given to them to soften the fall. Speak of faithfulness and loyalty.During that time the boss is playing his associates, deputies and other executives one against the others to select the two or three he will need afterwards. Because they liquidate their own firm, they lose all credibility and all customers, but since the crisis will explode just after that black day, which is a Friday of course, they will be accused of having started it, but in the longer run they will become geniuses and will recuperate their credibility and credit to start a new adventure, a financial speculative adventure of course, no matter what the conditions will be then.But you cannot flush the financial markets out of the picture. You have to get them under control and keep them under control. If we just blazed these financial firms out of the way we would be forgetting that we ALL need what they are providing: credit. We have an instalment purchasing plan here for a car, a house, a washing machine. We have a credit card there that gives us free or nearly free credit for slightly more than a month, though we cannot afford to overdraw at the end of the month when the credit card payments are balanced from your account, except if we can pay a 16 or 18% interest.And I repeat we are all responsible because we elected those who let the speculators come into the picture at first through the chimney like Santa Claus then through the window, finally through the door, at first under the table, then around the table and finally in the middle of the table top.

An especially intriguing aspect of this movie is that it remains keenly focused on the three classical Aristotelian unities of drama: unity of action (the story remains centered on the imminent demise of the American economy), unity of place (the vast majority of the action occurs within one firm's corporate office), and unity of time (all of the action takes place in one 24-hour period.). The film's crowning achievement is its ability to depict the human drama, anxiety, and uncertainty that led to and resulted from the economic mess we're all coping with today. ""Margin Call"" belongs to a very rare genre--the economic thriller--and it succeeds mainly due to its brilliant script (by writer/director J.C.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[3, 3]","Here we have a timely R-rated thriller that takes place in an investment bank (which shall remain nameless) on Day One of our latest financial disaster. We start with a downsizing: an employee is walked to a glass-enclosed office and heartlessly ""let go,"" in full view of his coworkers. As Security escorts him to the elevator with his pathetic banker's box of personal items, he hands a zip drive to a young colleague with the admonition: ""I was working on this and you need to finish it. Be careful.""By the time the young fellow completes the equations and realizes the magnitude of the situation, we are off and running. Of course with 20/20 hindsight, we know exactly how big and how brutal it was, what we only suspected was the extent of protection enjoyed by a self-serving top echelon of officers. Their ""take-home pay"" is mind-boggling.Investment banking is still mostly a guy thing: look at the cast:* Kevin Spacey (""Horrible Bosses"") is a long-term employee, a company man who weeps first for his dying dog and then for his beleaguered company.* Paul Bettany (""The Young Victoria"") is a mid-level manager, a survivor who knows when to escalate a problem.* Zachary Quinto (""Star Trek"") is the former engineer turned risk analyst who is handed that zip drive by his exiting boss.* Stanley Tucci (""Captain America"") is the first man out the door. I loved his story about the impact of a bridge he built across a river in the mid-West before he came to New York.* Simon Baker (""The Mentalist"") is a shrewd operator who shaves before a 3:00 AM Executive Board meeting.* Jeremy Irons (""Appaloosa"") is the CEO who sees this as just another bump in the road.* Penn Badgley (""Easy A"") is a recently hired employee who sobs in a mens' room stall.* Demi Moore (""Another Happy Day"") tried to warn the officers a year earlier and is now told to keep her mouth shut.It was a subdued screening audience that exited the theater. We have all felt the impact of that period of insanity and greed, so it's time to put faces on the villains.

Danzig,"[0, 1]","I consider ""Margin Call"" a riveting and credible drama about a fateful 24 hours at an investment firm on the eve of the 2008 financial meltdown.What really grabbed me is the quality of both the acting and the script.The cast is composed of nothing but heavy-hitters, and they're all at the top of their game here.  Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto, and Simon Baker all turn in brilliant, natural performances.The script was written by the first-time director, whose own father was a long-time Merrill Lynch employee let go during the downturn.The DVD has special features including a director's commentary and a few deleted scenes and a brief making-of featurette.I was struck by the director's comment in the making-of featurette that he tried not to make judgments about the characters in this piece, but I have to assume that the audience will make plenty of judgments about these overpaid and under-principled traders.Take the Spacey character, who isn't the slightest bit nonplussed when he has to lay off half of his staff, but who is reduced to tears when his dog is dying.  As the firm's glamorous but unscrupulous CEO, Jeremy Irons also makes a chilling and effective pitch to keep the Spacey character at the firm after they succeed in selling off their most toxic assets to unsuspecting customers.I also admired a remarkable scene in an elevator when two of the senior partners are talking in code about the events of the day while a cleaning woman stands between them with her cleaning cart, trying to block out their drama with a smile of inoffensive submission on her face.In its quiet and effective way, ""Margin Call"" shows what's wrong with our society -- and what's right when an art form shines a light on our greed and corruption.

Then you realise that this has the feel of a play made into a film.As in Glengarry Glen Ross, Kevin Spacey plays the office manager. This time his character is more clued in.I can understand why the business with the dog was put in. But that bit just doesn't work for me.And I would guess that real-life trading floors are far more venal than portrayed here.The movie echoes the 2007-08 subprime crash. What must a company do when it realises it is carrying a ton of dodgy subprime muck? The answer is that the muck must be dumped - at any cost. This is trading - not the Salvation Army. Giving Kevin Spacey's character a sick dog is not going to soften the body blow to the public. We are the ultimate victims. Just look at how we, the public, have all been shafted by greedy bankers and their cohorts. And the ongoing price we are paying for their ineptitude and fat bonuses.Overall though this is a very good movie.

One of the middle bosses being let go gives a data chip to his brightest subordinate and tells him to look into the data but to be careful!  What unfolds is the realization that the Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) market is about to collapse and drag their company and the world markets down with them.The management meets all night and decides that their financial future means more to them than honesty and trying to help others.  This is a shockingly terrifying movie about the realities of the USA and global financial markets where a handful of people make millions (Or billions) at the expense of everybody else who invests in the market or saves their money in a bank.This movie hits the problem head on and shows how the people sold bad securities knowing that the buyers would lose everything so that they could make personal financial gains of millions of dollars in a few hours.  The buyers purchased the securities knowing something was going on but their own greed made them make bad decisions.I am sorry to have spelled out so much of the plot of the movie but I see the disaster that this kind of thinking caused and that we are still conducting business today with the same rules.  Watch this movie and then decide if you will ever trust a stock broker or firm again.The movie features some great actors and they do a good job of bringing forth the story of greed and corrupt financial polices! It is worth 4 stars just to let movie watchers see the mentality of the people they trust their money with!,4,If this movie doesn't make you mad then nothing will!,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1793,"['**Spoiler**This', 'story', 'first', 'day', 'financial', 'collapse', 'US', 'banks', 'market', 'then', 'world', 'financial', 'markets', 'movie', 'massive', 'layoff', 'being', 'done', 'let', 'go', '80', 'percent', 'employees', 'financial', 'firm', 'typical', 'black', 'Monday', 'One', 'middle', 'bosses', 'being', 'let', 'go', 'data', 'chip', 'brightest', 'subordinate', 'look', 'data', 'be', 'careful', 'What', 'realization', 'Mortgage', 'Backed', 'Securities', 'MBS', 'market', 'collapse', 'drag', 'company', 'world', 'markets', 'down', 'them.The', 'management', 'meets', 'night', 'decides', 'financial', 'future', 'more', 'honesty', 'trying', 'help', 'others', 'shockingly', 'terrifying', 'movie', 'realities', 'USA', 'global', 'financial', 'markets', 'where', 'handful', 'people', 'make', 'millions', 'Or', 'billions', 'expense', 'everybody', 'else', 'who', 'market', 'saves', 'money', 'bank.This', 'movie', 'problem', 'head', 'how', 'people', 'sold', 'bad', 'securities', 'knowing', 'buyers', 'would', 'lose', 'everything', 'could', 'make', 'personal', 'financial', 'gains', 'millions', 'dollars', 'few', 'hours', 'buyers', 'purchased', 'securities', 'knowing', 'something', 'was', 'going', 'own', 'greed', 'made', 'make', 'bad', 'decisions.I', 'am', 'sorry', 'have', 'spelled', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'see', 'disaster', 'kind', 'thinking', 'caused', 'are', 'still', 'conducting', 'business', 'today', 'same', 'rules', 'Watch', 'movie', 'then', 'decide', 'will', 'ever', 'trust', 'stock', 'broker', 'firm', 'again.The', 'movie', 'great', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'forth', 'story', 'greed', 'corrupt', 'financial', 'polices', 'worth', '4', 'stars', 'just', 'let', 'movie', 'watchers', 'see', 'mentality', 'people', 'trust', 'money']",Margin Call

Kevin Spacey gets top billing, but most of the characters are portrayed by folks with lengthy lists of acting credits, oftentimes pretty high profile. I found it interesting that they would all be drawn to a film like this that isn't super high profile. Demi Moore plays the one female character of note.So as not to spoil things for those who intend on watching the film, I'll just say the plot is basically one where a major financial firm finds itself in a bad spot in terms of mortgage security holdings and has to work its way out of it. Actually, the story is that simple and straightforward. No major plot twists. There also isn't too much in the way of high level quant stuff aside from a VAR reference, though there could easily have been (for better or worse, depending on your point of view). There did seem to be a reference to the so-called formula that killed Wall Street, but only in passing.I was tempted to call this movie a morality tale, but that's not really a good description. The story's major tension is one of character perspective and turmoil between the idea of doing what needs to be done for the sake of the firm (at least as they see it) and the impact that could/would have in the broader scope. There is no real attempt to provide a ""right"" answer, though. It ends up being more a question of characters working through their own issues.Overall, I found the film a bit plodding and lacking in the kind of tension and drama that pulls the viewer through to the conclusion of movies like Wall Street (the original, not the sequel) and Dealers.

I offer this as a source of perspective.I have a very good friend who worked in what can be best described as a very senior back office capacity re: mortgages, on the West Coast.  He recently watched the movie and thought that it was badly paced and that the script didn't do enough with the star studded ensemble cast.  I respectfully disagree.  IMHO, what makes this movie great is that it took a large number of recognizable actors and placed them all in one dimensional roles.  What is this you say, one dimensional roles don't often make for a good movie?  In this movie and with such a large cast, the risk is that actors will often step out of their respective roles in an effort to get marquis billing, which can result in both over playing their role and a highly uneven telling of the story. What is great here is that no one actor outperforms the other.Having sat on a trading floor for 5+ years, so much of what was portrayed rang true:1.) The method by which employees are terminated.  At my firm they did things slightly different.  Those that were to be let go were called to a meeting in a conference room, while those that were retained were given a private audience where a retention agreement was offered.  Some firms did actually escort you out of the building, though the image of walking out the door with a box of your personal belongings in highly accurate2.) The confused looks of management when they were shown the conclusions reached by the current risk model.  It is important to note that in most situations the models that are written to both book P&L; and manage risk are developed by ""quant's"" and that Sales & Trading may at best have a limited understanding of the underlying assumptions.  The more senior management, the less likely the understanding.  This was portrayed brilliantly in MC3.) The military like ""sacrificial lambs"".  The difference being that the pain involved in falling on one's ""sword"" is somewhat dulled by fairly generous termination packages.  I have personally born witness to this4.) When the decision was made exit the business by being first out, despite the large losses.  This was not in the film for dramatic effect.  When things were imploding, the general philosophy was that the first loss is the best loss!I personally liked the scene where the Paul Bettany character is standing on the roof with the 2 junior guys while giving an accounting of how he spent his bonus.  I also thought that the scene where the Sales Manager (Kevin Spacey) called a meeting of the sales staff where he essentially said you are all gone at the end of the day and while I realize that you will be jeopardizing both your professional integrity and future employability, we will pay you each ""$XXX"" million if you unload ""XXX"" of the firm's positions by EOB.  Subsequently, watching the Paul Bettany character starting the day selling in the 90's and ending in the 60's was chilling.  I mean how would you like to be that trader that bought 30-points high in the beginning of the trading day!I do admit that MC might appeal more to people that have some connection to the industry and have tried for years to explain to friends and family both what the work environment was like and what we actually did for a living!  In this respect, my 5* rating is biased.

1458511,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B005FITIGO,kacunnin,"[4, 4]","I really liked MARGIN CALL (dir. J. C. Chandor), but I have to admit I don't really understand it.  The plot revolves around a young risk analyst (Zachary Quinto) who discovers that his investment banking firm has misinterpreted its own equations and is on the verge of total collapse.  What ensues is a night of tension-filled meetings staffed by company higher-ups (Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Demi Moore) and eventually the CEO (Jeremy Irons).  As Irons explains it, they have three choices:  1) be first, 2) be smarter, or 3) cheat.  He rules out cheating, says he can't count on being smarter than anyone else, which leaves him with being first.  So the plan is to dump billions of dollars of unsecured junk on an unsuspecting market, which will save the firm even as it plunges all of Wall Street into chaos.As someone with no expertise in either economics or investment banking, I found myself struggling to understand exactly what was going down at MBS, the fictionalized Lehman-style investment house portrayed in the film.  Several characters try several times to explain it, but not very effectively.  At one point Jeremy Irons asks Spacey and Quinto to ""explain it as if you're speaking to a child,"" which gave me hope.  But phrases like ""historic volatility levels"" get in the way of making any of this understandable.  I get the overall picture - MBS (like Lehman) was making paper trades backed by worthless mortgages (among other low-rated vehicles) which they were playing off against each other like the proverbial house of cards.  When Quinto discovers the fatal flaw in their statistics, we know it will all come crashing down.  The question is whether MBS will put its own survival above that of its customers (and the American people).MARGIN CALL is a thrilling film, although it admittedly takes a bit of concentration to keep up with what's going on.  The performances (Irons, Spacey, and Quinto especially) are exceptional, and I have no doubt the film accurately reflects the mood of firms like Lehman that played a major role in the collapse of our economy in 2008.  But this is not a subject matter that easily translates to story - as such, I never found myself really connecting with any of these characters.  One moment - when Spacey embraces his dying dog at the vet's office - stands out as a glimpse of humanity in what is a very cold and merciless world.  I liked that.  It helped me relate to Spacey's character.  However, ultimately Spacey joins the others in a willingness to sell out humanity for cold, hard cash.  The world of MBS (like Wall Street in the ""real world"") is totally fixated on money - making it, holding onto it, and turning it into more money.There's one nice moment when two characters look out at the people on the streets of Manhattan and wish they could be as innocent of the horror that's about to be unleashed by MBS (and other Wall Street firms).  But Paul Bettany says it best:  ""People wanna live like this in their cars and big [******] houses they can't even pay for. The only reason that they all get to continue living like kings is `cause we got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off and then the whole world gets really [*******] fair really [*******] quickly and nobody actually wants that.""  This is the heart of MARGIN CALL.  We blame the 2008 crash on greedy Wall Street bankers and financiers, but they're only a reflection of the rest of us who want what we can't afford.MARGIN CALL is a good film, even if I don't understand it as well as I'd like.  It's also a film that will make you think about the world we live in.

This movie certainly had all the right actors to make such a movie.  However, it fails in a big way.  Don't waste your money or time by renting it.This movie was just boring--REALLY boring.  It didn't explain the financial crisis. Having read several books on the subject, I understand the crash (at least for a layman). I doubt that anyone who saw this movie would walk away enlightened or understanding the issues that led to it.  They never explain anything about the crash.  All you see is that a big wallstreet firm is overleveraged and is about to dump a bunch of stuff. They don't explain what's being dumped, why its being dumped, why the 'volatility' is happening...nothing. They made a movie on the crash and I'm not sure they ever even used the term 'subprime' in it.  That should tell you how little this movie explains the crash.The entire thing is laced with a class warfare overtone via one character who's only purpose in the film is to say, 'how much do you think so-and-so makes?' throughout the film.  Ok..we got the point.  Wallstreeters earn a lot of money.  We knew that going into the film so why beat it to death?In case that wasn't boring enough, half of the rest of the film is filled with silent panning scenes of everything from the NYC skyline to the streets to rooms of traders. The occasional silent, panning scene can be profound in a movie.  Silent panning scenes every 5 minutes in a film just suggests a lack of decent dialogue and space/time fillers.If you removed all the silent scenes and all of the scenes of little discussions about how much wallstreeters make, it would make no impact on the story but there would only be about half-hour of film left.Hopefully someone else will make a movie on this subject.

Tuld is clearly a play on Lehmann's Dick Fuld, and he takes a few light knocks, but writer/director Chandor lets the whole bunch off way too easy. Goldman was the worst but all the WS slimers knew exactly how crooked those mortgage tranches were, and that it would all collapse sooner or later. They also knew they'd get bailed out for being ""too big to fail""...after they let Lehmann go down in flames first. Oh, and they shorted their own damned and doomed-to-fail recommendations.Nothing too criminal there. Just the moneylenders back in the temple...This movie conveniently sidesteps all of that with vague references to ""warnings a year ago"", and in the end nobody really plays the villain, when almost all of them were. Add the soft-pedaling of the enormity of these crimes to the often glacially slow pace of this flick and you've got a pretty bad trade.Plus there are soooo many looooong scenes of guys gazing out the window meaningfully as the foreboding music heralds the looming disaster; that's grade-school tension-building and it just makes this film harder to sit through as it goes.Denby calling this the best Wall Street movie ever made is a joke and a half; the first Wall Street blows it out of the water in every single way. There are some decent performances here, especially Quinto, Baker, Spacey and Irons, but Stone grasped the Street's inherent criminality in way that Chandor refuses to. Predictably: his father was a trader at Merrill for four decades. Thus we get the ""blameless"" traders here, just following orders.But there was no Nuremburg for WS in 2008, was there? Hell, even the king scumbag whore Lloyd Blankfein sneered and laughed at the feds and was allowed to walk scot-free, and he was the worst criminal of them all, no mean feat. Still is.

And you can make art that really shows what's going on. Instead, we get this weak pablum that people call ""hard-hitting"". Uh huh.

1458528,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B005FITIGO,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[3, 5]","This movie has a superb cast, and a compelling topic, but unfortunately for me it fell flat, because the writing was too labored and the pacing too slow. The film focuses on one night at a fictional investment firm when it's discovered by a young analyst that with the firm's current holdings, their projected losses far exceed the total valuation of the firm - in other words, it's all about to fall apart, ala 2008. It's a tight drama, spanning about 36 hours, with most of the scenes taking place inside the offices of the firm, as the various players struggle to come to terms with this reality, what to do (or not do) about it, and what it means for them. The players include Stanley Tucci as a middle manager specializing in risk assessment who develops the model highlighting the issues, but is let go before he can complete them; Kevin Spacey as a higher level manager, the only one to show anything close to a human heart; Demi Moore as a cold Risk Management VP; Jeremy Irons as an even colder head of the company; and Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto and Penn Badgley as various underlings involved.Part of the problem for me is that the financial issues involved are all left very vague, so this isn't a film you will learn much from. It is meant to be more focused on the individuals involved, and the ethical dilemmas they faced (or didn't, as many aren't worried about much more than their own skins.) But the only individual that seems even close to three-dimensional is Keven Spacey - the rest are stereotypes. So it doesn't work as an emotional drama, because there isn't much emotion. The dialogue often feels very labored and false - you'd think there would be a little more confusion and anger on a night like this. Everyone also shows up for a crises meeting at 2am in full suits without a hair out of place, which seems a little labored as well. So we don't really get a new perspective on the crises, and we don't really get pulled into the inner lives of these characters either, so what's the point?That being said, Kevin Spacey, Stanely Tucci, and Jeremy Irons are all actors worth watching even in a so-so film, so that keeps it from 1 or 2 star status for me.",3,Too Dry and Abstract For My Taste,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,2184,"['movie', 'superb', 'cast', 'compelling', 'topic', 'unfortunately', 'fell', 'flat', 'writing', 'was', 'too', 'labored', 'pacing', 'too', 'slow', 'film', 'one', 'night', 'fictional', 'investment', 'firm', 'when', 'discovered', 'young', 'analyst', 'firm', 'current', 'holdings', 'projected', 'losses', 'far', 'exceed', 'total', 'valuation', 'firm', 'other', 'words', 'fall', 'apart', 'ala', '2008', 'tight', 'drama', 'spanning', '36', 'hours', 'most', 'scenes', 'taking', 'place', 'offices', 'firm', 'various', 'players', 'struggle', 'come', 'terms', 'reality', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'players', 'include', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'middle', 'manager', 'specializing', 'risk', 'assessment', 'who', 'model', 'highlighting', 'issues', 'let', 'go', 'can', 'complete', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'higher', 'level', 'manager', 'only', 'one', 'show', 'anything', 'close', 'human', 'heart', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'cold', 'Risk', 'Management', 'VP', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'even', 'colder', 'head', 'company', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'various', 'underlings', 'involved.Part', 'problem', 'financial', 'issues', 'involved', 'are', 'left', 'very', 'vague', ""n't"", 'film', 'will', 'learn', 'much', 'meant', 'be', 'more', 'focused', 'individuals', 'involved', 'ethical', 'dilemmas', 'faced', 'did', ""n't"", 'many', 'are', ""n't"", 'worried', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'own', 'skins', 'only', 'individual', 'even', 'close', 'three-dimensional', 'Keven', 'Spacey', 'rest', 'are', 'stereotypes', ""n't"", 'work', 'emotional', 'drama', ""n't"", 'much', 'emotion', 'dialogue', 'often', 'very', 'labored', 'false', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'confusion', 'anger', 'night', 'Everyone', 'also', 'up', 'crises', 'meeting', '2am', 'full', 'suits', 'hair', 'place', 'little', 'labored', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'new', 'perspective', 'crises', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'pulled', 'inner', 'lives', 'characters', 'what', 'point', 'being', 'said', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Stanely', 'Tucci', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'are', 'actors', 'watching', 'even', 'so-so', 'film', '1', '2', 'star', 'status']",Margin Call

However, had a free slot open and figured, what the heck? It has Kevin Spacey and Paul Bettany, actors whom I've long respected and liked. How bad could it be?Well, it wasn't. Not by a long shot.Beyond what the average person learns from the few unbiased journalists and angry duped investors, don't know too much about toxic mortgage products, derivatives, credit default swapping and the various gamblers who infest the industry to ply and play their games. But this stunning film cuts to heart of the issue - regardless of whether or not you're an addict in denial.Opens with an entry level analyst who picks up an incendiary project from his recently fired boss; tossed away in a typical ""reorganization"" that essentially eviscerated various divisions within a financial services company. Intuitively following up on the cryptic last comment made by his former superior, what he helps uncover is the tip of a terrifying iceberg - one that would eventually become a tipping point to global catastrophe.Forget the big names. We're talking families in homes that they should not have been able to afford, now on the streets. Millions of jobs lost that are never coming back. Frighteningly close to a breakdown of social order. The lives of average citizens upended and gutted. People who had absolutely nothing to do with what those soulless whores did to make an easy buck is revealed in this disturbing production.This struck a chord, reminding me of another film. An evil form of mathematics that worked out the cost-benefit ratio in its purest essence. In 2001 HBO released, ""Conspiracy"", detailing the 1941 meeting of Nazi hierarchy that laid out the foundation for The Final Solution. No morality, no ethics, no compassion, no humanity. Whatever worked out best for those sitting at the table - that's the plan. Simple as that. And the fictitious firm in 'Margin Call' is undoubtedly very much true-to-life of most, if not all, these types of businesses. Wannsee exponentially cubed.Thought it was fascinating that none, not even the senior analyst played by Spacey, heartbroken over the death of his beloved dog, are anything near sympathetic. You don't feel compassion for these people because they're not worthy of such generosity. These are self-serving manipulators who are out to get theirs - period. Any concept of ""honor"" or ""community"" does not exist for these muckers. In my opinion, for the most part, they're functioning sociopaths. One moment crying for a dying pet, the next, happily celebrating the symbolic deaths of their ill-fated colleagues, encouraging others to feel the same by specifically instructing them to totally and completely forget their existence. Wow.My understanding, confirmed by various dictionaries and medical profiles I perused, is that these people exhibit the very definition of sociopathy. If not naturally, then as part of an accepted set of rather appalling behaviors.Appreciated that the filmmakers gave us the choice of humanizing them or not.Not.Simultaneously revealing that the general populace is indeed as gullible as implied throughout the script. I looked up the dates that Jeremy Iron's character mentions in the film - 1637, 1797, 1819, 1827, 1857, 1884, 1901, 1907, 1929, 1937, 1974, 1987, 1992, 2000, etc. I was stunned. He's right. The gamblers can't help themselves. Especially when they're in positions of power such as government. There's no such thing as oversight, because our leaders are heavily invested in and paid recipients of the game. Terrifying.Personal Notes:- Paul Bettany's car speech is, despite the context, a bravura performance. Taking J.C. Chantos' words and imbuing them with a depth and quality sincerely equal to any Shakespearean soliloquy.Seth: ""Bleep, this is really going to affect people. Real people.""Will: ""Seth, listen, if you really want to do this with your life you have to believe you're necessary - and you are. People want to live like this - in their cars, in their big bleeping houses they can't even pay for - then you're necessary. The only reason they all get to continue living like kings is 'cause we've got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off, well then the whole world gets really bleeping fair, really bleeping quickly. And nobody actually wants that. They say they do, but they don't. They want what we have to give them, but they also want, you know, to play innocent and pretend to have no idea where it came from. And that's more hypocrisy than I'm willing to swallow. So bleep them. Bleep normal people.""Yep. And the scary part is that - he's not wrong. Bookies can't feel sorry for the avarice driven dupes that utilize their services. No one is holding a gun to anyone's head to play the market.- It's embarrassingly enjoyable, but when things turn truly desperate, I enjoyed watching the sharks devouring the other sharks. Those who thought to keep themselves 'safe', ultimately left without a chair when the music stopped. Small repayment, a tiny fractional bit of karmic justice, as several characters - including one of the architects of the twisted packaged mortgages plan - is told she will be the fatted calf, the sacrifice. After all her scheming and backstabbing - it's her reputation and career that will be publicly butchered. Ha ha.",5,"""So Bleep Them.

1458544,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B005FITIGO,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","""Margin Call"" is an impressive feature debut by director J.C. Chandor, who also wrote the film, drawing on the experiences of his friends and of his father, who was a trader at Merrill Lynch as his son was growing up. This film follows the turmoil inside a New York investment bank in 2008, over a period of about a day, as the bank's executives learn that their holdings of mortgage-backed securities are well outside acceptable volatility bands, a situation that could wipe out the bank's entire value if it doesn't unload the securities first. Chandor seems to draw on the recent histories of Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs in constructing this fly-on-the-wall drama of critical events in the biggest crisis in Wall Street history.Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), analyst at a New York investment bank, finishes work on a risk analysis project that his recently laid-off boss, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), had begun. Alarmed by what he finds, Peter asks his friend Seth (Penn Badgley), a junior analyst, and the Head of Trading Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) to come in after hours to take a look. The company's holdings of mortgage-backed securities have become disturbingly volatile, which, combined with excessive leverage, will soon put the bank's very existence at risk. Sufficiently frightened by Peter's numbers, Will calls the man in charge of the floor, Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), who in turn calls his boss and on up the chain to CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), who must decide whom and what to save.John Tuld is obviously inspired by Dick Fuld, former CEO of Lehman Brothers. His actions resemble some of the speculation about Goldman Sachs' behavior in 2008. The film is almost voyeuristic in its perspective on how these people act in crisis. There are a variety of personalities at the bank, most of whom are going to lose their jobs one way or another. I imagine that different audiences will take different things away. I found ""Margin Call"" generally sympathetic toward the bankers, traders, and analysts. It does not address how they got into this predicament, which is where their real failure lies. It focuses on how they get out of it -but without explaining that they have little choice but to act in the interest of shareholders, even if they weren't averse to destroying themselves.These men have only bad choices. They can either do something that looks an awful lot like fraud, or they can wipe out their shareholders, burden the taxpayer, and freeze the credit markets, creating countless more casualties. J.C. Chandor could have been harder on them, and he could have been more sympathetic. By choosing a middle road, he may leave a large part of the audience unsatisfied. I admire him for being authentic rather than dogmatic, though. Seth acts as a kind of tour guide for the audience. A junior analyst in his first job and first crisis, he keeps asking people how much money they make. I enjoyed the compelling characters and dialogue and the look behind the scenes.

1458545,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B005FITIGO,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 0]","The tale of a financial firm that screws up its gargantuan value, sells at a loss and leads America into the 2008 financial crisis. It's a lot more complicated than that in the film but I'm trying to simplify it. There's a very impressive cast set up with this film: Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Zachary Quinto, Paul Bettany, Stanley Tucci, Simon Baker and a cameo at the very end from Marcy McDonnel. Overall, they all deliver a very good or better presentation of their characters. Spacey is the worn out cynic who's too wrapped up in more personal matters to completely care; Moore and Baker play high up rivals trying to survive the fallout; Quinto is the young brain who first discovers the problem; and Irons is the highest of the high who comes down upon the company with a cold precision and dominant authority at the meetings. There's definitely some ethical choices being made here and for the most part the question is brought up as to whether the right thing is being done. There's also a strong showing of disconnectedness to humanity as these people toss around six figure salaries and much higher as if they were tossing about spare change. Junior types, when not wondering if their bosses really make $2M or more a year compared to their 100k+ salaries, wonder what the common people are doing since they have no clue what is going to happen. Few are sympathetic and some seem resentful that they're giving better credit lines to the masses yet being looked down upon for being greedy Wall Street types. There's some truth in most of the statements, especially if you're on that side of the fence. Math nerds will notice Tucci's error in the latter part of the film when he talks about his engineering gig. This film cost about $3.5M to make (most of the big name actors/actresses didn't work for much) and yielded a bit over $10M at the worldwide Box Office. It was first offered up at the January 2011 Sundance Film Festival.

They all did a good job but Jereme Irons was ""incredible"". His part reminds me of the power displayed by Cristopher Walker in his ""sinister"" role as the counselor for a Don in the movie True Romance. Irons played the role of a CEO of an investment firm and you could feel the power of the character he played. His scenes were show stopping. His acting is worthy of an academy award. Paul Bettany also did an excellent job in his character as an investment floor supervisor. It was a change up for him in roles and it showed why he is such a good and powerful actor.The script was the next pleasant surprise. I was expecting a movie that was going to bash the Wall Street People but instead it was a thoughtfully well scripted movie showing the ordinary lives of people who got caught up in the meltdown. There was no right or wrong or Democrat/Republican ""stuff"". Just a story of how part of the meltdown happened, how some investment people dealt with it and how it affected parts of their personal lives.

1458549,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005FITIGO,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","Director and writer J. C. Chandor makes an impressive debut with this taut financial thriller.  With a host of ""A"" list actors in the cast, Chandor manages to take the abstruse world of Wall Street shenanigans that sent markets reeling in 2008, and makes them palatable for viewer consumption.Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), a 19 year veteran manager of a Lehman Brothers-like firm is abruptly fired along with many others in the trading division.  He hands off information he had been working on to Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), a subordinate analyst.  Peter, who has a Ph.D. in rocket propulsion or something, is able to finish Eric projections.  They suggest that the bundled mortgage-backed securities owned by the firm will soon become worthless.  As this information is elevated throughout the firm, the various players work throughout the night to figure a way out.Key players include Paul Bettany as Will who is Eric and Peter's boss.  He reports to Sam Rogers (terrific Kevin Spacey) who heads up the trading division.  Even higher in the food chain are risk manager, Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore), CEO Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) and chairman John Tuld (cool and collected Jeremy Irons).  Irrespective of their decisions, it would appear that the firm is toast, so the calculation is how to get out with the least pain, at least for those at the top.Surprisingly, Chandor's story manages to create empathy for most of the players here.  With the exception of Cohen who suggested the risky strategy with hesitant help from Robertson and Tuld who made the decision, others were unaware of what was going on.  Many innocent employees of the firm will ultimately lose their job.  The firm makes a decision to sell all of their assets, without acquiring new ones.  As the word quickly gets out about the fire sale, the firm and the rest of those involved in risky financial vehicles like this bring the economy to its knees.  The rest is history.The movie works in real time which adds a layer of intrigue as implications sink in for all involved.  This is a terrific film that provides an easy to understand look at the inner workings of one investment company.The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p and has a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  While there is nothing eye popping the transfer looks very good with a pleasant blue hint of tint (suits, ties, etc.) in many scenes.  The night shots of NYC look great with the bright lights of the skyline contrasting with the dark sky.  The audio has a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which is also very good if not profound.  With the exception of a bustling trading floor and some exterior scenes most of the dialog heavy film is shot inside small rooms.  Extras include a commentary with Chandor, some deleted scenes, a gag reel, a 6 minute ""making of"" segment and some photos.",4,BLU RAY look at excellent Wall Street drama,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,2807,"['Director', 'writer', 'J.', 'C.', 'Chandor', 'impressive', 'debut', 'taut', 'financial', 'thriller', 'host', 'A', 'list', 'actors', 'cast', 'Chandor', 'take', 'abstruse', 'world', 'Wall', 'Street', 'shenanigans', 'sent', 'markets', 'reeling', '2008', 'palatable', 'viewer', 'consumption.Eric', 'Dale', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', '19', 'year', 'veteran', 'manager', 'Lehman', 'Brothers-like', 'firm', 'abruptly', 'fired', 'many', 'others', 'trading', 'division', 'information', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'Peter', 'Sullivan', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'subordinate', 'analyst', 'Peter', 'who', 'Ph.D.', 'rocket', 'propulsion', 'something', 'able', 'finish', 'Eric', 'projections', 'suggest', 'bundled', 'mortgage-backed', 'securities', 'owned', 'firm', 'will', 'soon', 'become', 'worthless', 'information', 'elevated', 'firm', 'various', 'players', 'work', 'night', 'figure', 'way', 'out.Key', 'players', 'include', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Will', 'who', 'Eric', 'Peter', 'boss', 'Sam', 'Rogers', 'terrific', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'up', 'trading', 'division', 'Even', 'higher', 'food', 'chain', 'are', 'risk', 'manager', 'Sarah', 'Robertson', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'CEO', 'Jared', 'Cohen', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'chairman', 'John', 'Tuld', 'cool', 'collected', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Irrespective', 'decisions', 'would', 'appear', 'firm', 'toast', 'calculation', 'how', 'get', 'out', 'least', 'pain', 'least', 'top.Surprisingly', 'Chandor', 'story', 'create', 'empathy', 'most', 'players', 'here', 'exception', 'Cohen', 'who', 'suggested', 'risky', 'strategy', 'hesitant', 'help', 'Robertson', 'Tuld', 'who', 'made', 'decision', 'others', 'were', 'unaware', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Many', 'innocent', 'employees', 'firm', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lose', 'job', 'firm', 'decision', 'sell', 'assets', 'acquiring', 'new', 'ones', 'word', 'quickly', 'out', 'fire', 'sale', 'firm', 'rest', 'involved', 'risky', 'financial', 'vehicles', 'bring', 'economy', 'knees', 'rest', 'history.The', 'movie', 'real', 'time', 'layer', 'intrigue', 'implications', 'sink', 'involved', 'terrific', 'film', 'easy', 'understand', 'look', 'inner', 'workings', 'one', 'investment', 'company.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', '1080p', '1.78:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'nothing', 'eye', 'popping', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'pleasant', 'blue', 'hint', 'tint', 'suits', 'ties', 'etc', 'many', 'scenes', 'night', 'shots', 'NYC', 'look', 'great', 'bright', 'lights', 'skyline', 'contrasting', 'dark', 'sky', 'audio', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'profound', 'exception', 'bustling', 'trading', 'floor', 'exterior', 'scenes', 'most', 'dialog', 'heavy', 'film', 'shot', 'inside', 'small', 'rooms', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'Chandor', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', '6', 'minute', 'making', 'segment', 'photos']",Margin Call
1458550,AV252YPWNODEV,B005FITIGO,M. Oliver,"[1, 3]","This movie is another one in a line of movies I have recently watched that have incredibly good actors playing parts that were really just not worthy of their acting ability.  Whether that is the fault of the casting director, the actor (poor role selection) or some issue on directing it is hard to say, but this movie just never gels.  Ultimately the viewer comes away unsatisfied.  The movie includes 3 Academy Award winning actors - Jeremy Irons (Academy Award forReversal of FortuneReversal of Fortune), Kevin Spacey (Academy Award forAmerican BeautyAmerican Beauty) and Stanley Tucci (Academy Award forThe Lovely BonesThe Lovely Bones).  Add to that several other very good well known actors - and I was expecting a much better movie.The movie takes place in basically a 24 hr period inside an investment firm.  A senior investment manager is working on some kind of project - the day that the firm is laying off 80% of its work force.  The senior manager is let go, and as he walks out, he hands a thumb drive to a younger analyst who survived the cut (this is the first hint this movie is not going to be very good, the idea that security would have allowed this guy to take a thumbrive with him is not realistic).  He says something like ""take a look"" and so as the young analyst's friends go out for a nite of drinking to celebrate surviving the cut, the young analyst ""solves"" the missing pieces of the work of the senior manager, calls his friends and shows them this ""startling"" discovery.  At this point, a series more and more senior people are ""called in"" to view this discovery, and each level up, the seriousness of this discovery becomes more an more alarming.The movie then just goes into stupid mode.  It is like 2 am when the office manager (played by Kevin Spacey) is called back, and he calls some guy who is really not introduced well (played by Simon Baker) who is younger, better dressed, and seems like some kind of useless middleman.  He then calls the head of the board (played by Jeremy Irons) and then somehow magically the entire board is called in, they all show up at like 4am spotlessly dressed.  Meanwhile, the young analyst and his friend who also survived the cut are out looking for the senior manager who was fired.  They cannot reach him because his blackberry was turned off . . . and so on.  It just gets dumb at this point because these two young guys are wandering around New York (they stop at a strip club for some reason) and just are all over the place looking for the senior manager.  They come back, then a more senior guy (played by Paul Bettany) goes out with them.The young analyst is a nuclear engineer who left his prior job for more money etc.  There are just too many characters in the movie that are not introduced or whose role really is not explained.  Like, why is Demi Moore's character in this movie even there?  I never did get what her position was exactly.  Eventually the characters start pointing fingers at each other over this ""discovery"" which the viewer still has no idea what they discovered.  Eventually the viewer finds out - sort of - what the discovery is (and I will not list it here and spoil the movie).  Let me just say that the full explanation of the discovery is totally anticlimactic.I co-teach a graduate engineering law and ethics course, and I was hoping this movie might provide some prescient statements of ethical or social/moral issues.  It really doesn't.  In the end, the investment firm engages in a ""fire sale"" and ruins its reputation in the saving of the firm.  The viewer is supposed to connect this I guess to the Bear Stearns failure in 2007.  However, there is no real explanation of what a ""risk manager"" is or what hedging is.  It just came off as flat to me.  Yes, the characters are mostly sycophants and narcissists (and mostly well acted this way) - but, where there is an opportunity for some reflection and moral self-analysis by some of the characters - they never do - even the fired senior manager and the idealistic young analyst ultimately just join the rest of the characters in the grand fire sale scheme.The lack of character development, lack of cohesive story, and the random interactions of the characters just makes a mess of the movie.",3,Another mediocre movie not worthy of the actors in it,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,4260,"['movie', 'one', 'line', 'movies', 'have', 'recently', 'watched', 'have', 'incredibly', 'good', 'actors', 'playing', 'parts', 'were', 'really', 'just', 'not', 'worthy', 'acting', 'ability', 'fault', 'casting', 'director', 'actor', 'poor', 'role', 'selection', 'issue', 'directing', 'hard', 'say', 'movie', 'just', 'never', 'gels', 'Ultimately', 'viewer', 'away', 'unsatisfied', 'movie', '3', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actors', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Academy', 'Award', 'forReversal', 'FortuneReversal', 'Fortune', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Academy', 'Award', 'forAmerican', 'BeautyAmerican', 'Beauty', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Academy', 'Award', 'forThe', 'Lovely', 'BonesThe', 'Lovely', 'Bones', 'Add', 'several', 'other', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'better', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'place', 'basically', '24', 'hr', 'period', 'investment', 'firm', 'A', 'senior', 'investment', 'manager', 'working', 'kind', 'project', 'day', 'firm', 'laying', 'off', '80', '%', 'work', 'force', 'senior', 'manager', 'let', 'go', 'out', 'thumb', 'drive', 'younger', 'analyst', 'who', 'survived', 'cut', 'first', 'hint', 'movie', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'security', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'guy', 'take', 'thumbrive', 'not', 'realistic', 'something', 'take', 'look', 'so', 'young', 'analyst', 'friends', 'go', 'out', 'nite', 'drinking', 'celebrate', 'surviving', 'cut', 'young', 'analyst', 'solves', 'missing', 'pieces', 'work', 'senior', 'manager', 'friends', 'startling', 'discovery', 'point', 'series', 'more', 'more', 'senior', 'people', 'are', 'called', 'view', 'discovery', 'level', 'up', 'seriousness', 'discovery', 'more', 'more', 'alarming.The', 'movie', 'then', 'just', 'stupid', 'mode', '2', 'am', 'when', 'office', 'manager', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'called', 'back', 'guy', 'who', 'really', 'not', 'introduced', 'well', 'played', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'who', 'younger', 'better', 'dressed', 'kind', 'useless', 'middleman', 'then', 'head', 'board', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'then', 'somehow', 'magically', 'entire', 'board', 'called', 'show', 'up', '4am', 'spotlessly', 'dressed', 'Meanwhile', 'young', 'analyst', 'friend', 'who', 'also', 'survived', 'cut', 'are', 'out', 'looking', 'senior', 'manager', 'who', 'was', 'fired', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'blackberry', 'was', 'turned', 'off', 'so', 'just', 'dumb', 'point', 'two', 'young', 'guys', 'are', 'wandering', 'New', 'York', 'stop', 'strip', 'club', 'reason', 'just', 'are', 'place', 'looking', 'senior', 'manager', 'come', 'back', 'then', 'more', 'senior', 'guy', 'played', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'out', 'them.The', 'young', 'analyst', 'nuclear', 'engineer', 'who', 'left', 'prior', 'job', 'more', 'money', 'etc', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'introduced', 'role', 'really', 'not', 'explained', 'why', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'character', 'movie', 'even', 'never', 'did', 'get', 'what', 'position', 'was', 'exactly', 'Eventually', 'characters', 'start', 'pointing', 'fingers', 'other', 'discovery', 'viewer', 'still', 'idea', 'what', 'discovered', 'Eventually', 'viewer', 'out', 'sort', 'what', 'discovery', 'will', 'not', 'list', 'here', 'spoil', 'movie', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'full', 'explanation', 'discovery', 'totally', 'anticlimactic.I', 'co-teach', 'graduate', 'engineering', 'law', 'ethics', 'course', 'was', 'hoping', 'movie', 'might', 'provide', 'prescient', 'statements', 'ethical', 'social/moral', 'issues', 'really', ""n't"", 'end', 'investment', 'firm', 'fire', 'sale', 'reputation', 'saving', 'firm', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'connect', 'guess', 'Bear', 'Stearns', 'failure', '2007', 'However', 'real', 'explanation', 'what', 'risk', 'manager', 'what', 'hedging', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'flat', 'Yes', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'sycophants', 'narcissists', 'mostly', 'well', 'acted', 'way', 'where', 'opportunity', 'reflection', 'moral', 'self-analysis', 'characters', 'never', 'do', 'even', 'fired', 'senior', 'manager', 'idealistic', 'young', 'analyst', 'ultimately', 'just', 'join', 'rest', 'characters', 'grand', 'fire', 'sale', 'scheme.The', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'lack', 'cohesive', 'story', 'random', 'interactions', 'characters', 'just', 'mess', 'movie']",Margin Call

Chandor for writing and directing this remarkable film, which never patronizes its audience or demonizes its subjects -- the men (and a few women) who traded mortgage-backed securities in the days leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Chandor recognized that these traders and sales people and their colleagues provided legitimate human drama, and that their actions raised worthwhile questions about fairness, and how we should respond if asked to hurt others, or to make personal sacrifices for the survival of a company that would make no sacrifice for us.(Spoilers below)As the story unfurled and the immensity of the crisis became apparent to management, I expected a by-the-numbers thriller in which evil management tries to eliminate the nosy underlings who have discovered their dirty secrets.Nothing like that happens. Mid-level risk manager Zachary Quinto completes an analysis by his boss, Stanley Tucci, and realizes that the firm's survival is threatened by even a small drop in housing prices or increase in price volatility. He immediately calls in his boss, who doesn't at first understand but who is convinced. He escalates the problem. This cycle repeats itself until, with a few hours, the CEO and executive committee of the bank is involved and sets the strategy for the next day's trading.It's virtually all 100% believable, down to fine touches like the fact that the characters on screen never mention the kind of securities they trade until the problem has been escalated to the CEO's level. In real life they wouldn't need to, as they all worked in the same group and the assets would already have been assumed. The casual way in which the characters discuss money rings totally true. The relationship between the traders and risk managers and management felt right (I work on Wall Street and could tell who held which job on the basis of their behavior long before the script made it clear).I've only a few minor issues with the film -- first, in real life, if you hold an emergency meeting at 4:00am, not everybody shows up in a perfectly pressed suit, perfectly shaved and/or coiffed. Second, the moral qualms shown by Kevin Spacey weren't quite right. He knew that his traders were going to hurt their customers, and that many of them would be fired soon afterwards, but I can't imagine the real world equivalent of his character worrying that  his employees would be unemployable as a result. In reality, his desk produced results better than any of its competitors by selling earlier, and that track record would add enormous resume value to every member of his team. At one point Zachary Quinto learns how much the head of his trading desk made the year before, and he expresses surprise and populist objections. No part of that felt right.There was a problem with my copy of the DVD, with brightness levels changing discontinuously about half a dozen times. I don't know if that is a general problem with the mastering or not.Anyway, an excellent film. I'd give 4.5 stars if I could.",4,much smarter and more humane than I expected any movie about the financial crisis would ever be,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,3033,"['Kudos', 'J.C.', 'Chandor', 'writing', 'directing', 'remarkable', 'film', 'never', 'audience', 'subjects', 'men', 'few', 'women', 'who', 'traded', 'mortgage-backed', 'securities', 'days', 'leading', 'up', '2008', 'financial', 'crisis', 'Chandor', 'recognized', 'traders', 'sales', 'people', 'colleagues', 'provided', 'legitimate', 'human', 'drama', 'actions', 'raised', 'worthwhile', 'questions', 'fairness', 'how', 'should', 'respond', 'asked', 'hurt', 'others', 'make', 'personal', 'sacrifices', 'survival', 'company', 'would', 'make', 'sacrifice', 'Spoilers', 'below', 'story', 'unfurled', 'immensity', 'crisis', 'became', 'apparent', 'management', 'expected', 'by-the-numbers', 'thriller', 'evil', 'management', 'tries', 'eliminate', 'nosy', 'underlings', 'who', 'have', 'discovered', 'dirty', 'secrets.Nothing', 'Mid-level', 'risk', 'manager', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'analysis', 'boss', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'firm', 'survival', 'threatened', 'even', 'small', 'drop', 'housing', 'prices', 'increase', 'price', 'volatility', 'immediately', 'boss', 'who', ""n't"", 'first', 'understand', 'who', 'convinced', 'problem', 'cycle', 'few', 'hours', 'CEO', 'executive', 'committee', 'bank', 'involved', 'strategy', 'next', 'day', 'trading.It', 'virtually', '100', '%', 'believable', 'down', 'fine', 'touches', 'fact', 'characters', 'screen', 'never', 'mention', 'kind', 'securities', 'trade', 'problem', 'been', 'escalated', 'CEO', 'level', 'real', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'worked', 'same', 'group', 'assets', 'would', 'already', 'have', 'been', 'assumed', 'casual', 'way', 'characters', 'discuss', 'money', 'rings', 'totally', 'true', 'relationship', 'traders', 'risk', 'managers', 'management', 'felt', 'right', 'work', 'Wall', 'Street', 'could', 'tell', 'who', 'held', 'job', 'basis', 'behavior', 'long', 'script', 'made', 'clear', '.I', ""'ve"", 'only', 'few', 'minor', 'issues', 'film', 'first', 'real', 'life', 'hold', 'emergency', 'meeting', '4:00am', 'not', 'everybody', 'up', 'perfectly', 'pressed', 'suit', 'perfectly', 'shaved', 'and/or', 'coiffed', 'Second', 'moral', 'qualms', 'shown', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'knew', 'traders', 'were', 'going', 'hurt', 'customers', 'many', 'would', 'be', 'fired', 'soon', 'afterwards', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'real', 'world', 'equivalent', 'character', 'worrying', 'employees', 'would', 'be', 'unemployable', 'result', 'reality', 'desk', 'produced', 'results', 'better', 'competitors', 'selling', 'earlier', 'track', 'record', 'would', 'add', 'enormous', 'resume', 'value', 'member', 'team', 'one', 'point', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'how', 'much', 'head', 'trading', 'desk', 'made', 'year', 'surprise', 'populist', 'objections', 'part', 'felt', 'was', 'problem', 'copy', 'DVD', 'brightness', 'levels', 'changing', 'discontinuously', 'dozen', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'general', 'problem', 'mastering', 'not.Anyway', 'excellent', 'film', ""'d"", 'give', '4.5', 'stars', 'could']",Margin Call

We are still reeling from this mess in 2011 and we will all be paying for the incomprehensible foolishness and cronyism for many, many, many years to come. This movie makes characters like Wall Street's Gordon Gecko look like a street beggar by comparison. Building houses of cards is nothing to be proud of and while the characters all feign humility and acknowledgment of that fact, none of them do anything to change it. Why? Because none of them actually believes it. Wealth and power have total control of their every waking (and even sleeping) moment.  In the end, all characters must admit to their failure as self-righteous twits because all involved were so personally leveraged they had to make a deal with the Devil.  Watching them all squirm offers a touch of fun for the viewer.This is a decent film, though far from perfect. I can understand why some people will say it is just too boring. Yes there were times that I found myself a bit bored by the relentless diatribes full of justification through Darwinian zero sum game philosophy and the bang-you-over-the-head post modernist human condition, detestation for their fellow man (suckers deserve to lose) stuff. There is little subtly and nuance to this film; no lines of gray, no ambiguities. The characters are all despicable scoundrels and thieves who become a bit cartoonish at some point. More editing would have been appropriate as the movie is clearly half an hour too long.All that said, I did enjoy it. Some of the writing is sharp, well researched, and it wasn't dumbed down for the masses like one might expect. Most people will not really understand what is going on.  What created such fear in these desk jockeys working to solve their problem over a 24 hour period becomes obvious as it is revealed to the movie goer that NO ONE really knows what's going on. Part of the point of the film is that no person or no group actually understood what was going on or how these ridiculous financial models were developed -let alone capitalized. In the end we are left wondering why so many ""smart"" people can leave values, sense, and sensibilities behind and do such stupid things...oh ya that's right, it's that whole greed thing. Not so fast. There has to be more to it than just greed right? The acting is sharp and well done by all. As expected Irons, Tucci, and Spacey are standouts -more Tucci would have been great.This movie is an attempt to shed some light on the absurdity that has become Wall Street --where unbridled greed has become so ubiquitous that Wall Street firms and banks are now nothing short of crime syndicates staffed by well dressed con men.  This ain't your daddy's Wall Street anymore.  Gone are the antiquated Graham and Dodd days of fair valuation analysis and steady dividend yield investments.  What we have now are supercomputers processing probability algorithms designed by rocket scientists processing at millions of iterations per second.  What they are doing isn't illegal (yet?), but it is wrong and they all know it. When heavy-handed government regulation comes crashing down on the financial industry they all cry foul but they have no one to blame but themselves.BTW, how's your 401K doing these days???

MARGIN CALL fits that tough standard very well indeed.  Writer/director JC Chandor has crafted a fill that makes the Wall Street machinations in the hours before the financial meltdown into a thriller that's character driven and as tense as a top-notch spy story.Late one afternoon, just hours after 80% of the department he works in has been laid off, a data analyst at a gigantic trading firm (Zachary Quinto) discovers that the very foundation of the products his firm has been trading has been based on faulty assumptions.  It's too late to reverse the damage...the collapse of the firm is literally at hand.  He tells his boss (Paul Bettany) and the corporate damage control begins.  In many ways, MARGIN CALL is about how the news is received by each layer on the organizational chart, up to the CEO (Jeremy Irons)...all in the wee hours of the night.  Great drama is created simply by watching the realization sink in.  The posturing and maneuvering to cling to a high paying job is always there as well, and it's fascinating to watch.  I've spent a few years working on the lower rungs of ""corporate America"" (not in banking/trading) and really enjoyed the attention to detail in the corporate touches.  How as the next highest level person appearing on the scene makes the previously powerful person just a step down suddenly behave like a scared college intern.  And when the CEO arrives (by corporate helicopter, no less) you can feel the fear sweating out of these men and women as they a) break the horrible news to the man who can destroy them & b) work to maneuver the situation to their advantage.  It's a sinking ship, but each person wants to go down with it rather than be thrown overboard.The performances are outstanding all around.  This movie is mostly talking, and it's mostly about fairly dry material.  But the script is so clear and crisp that it hums right along, and the actors all tear into it with gusto.  Kevin Spacey steals nearly all his scenes, but he's matched by the oily, riveting Irons.  Bettany is effective, and I really enjoyed Simon Baker in his role as an upper executive.  Also on hand in a smaller role was Stanley Tucci, who simply is unable to give an uninteresting performance.  Demi Moore has a small role, and I was reminded of what a great corporate mover and shaker she can be...thinking back to her role in DISCLOSURE nearly 20 years ago.Sometimes, the script has to find ways to make the somewhat obtuse details of the financial collapse understandable to the viewer.  These are sometimes well handled, but sometimes a bit clumsy.  When your CEO says ""Explain it to me as though I was a child"", you know that's meant for the audience not the CEO.  The occasional inelegance of this device, as well as the annoying presence of Penn Badgley (a far inferior performer compared to the rest of the cast) as a friend of Quinto's who has nothing really to contribute to the events of the film keep this film just below the status of classic in my book.But it's still an important film and it's riveting.  Even if you don't care about the details of the financial collapse, the film is well worth seeing.  When you've got Irons, Spacey, Tucci & Bettany all at the tops of their games...it's easy to strongly recommend MARGIN CALL.",5,4.5 stars.

Buffington,"[1, 1]","""Margin Call"" is basically the story of a mythical Wall Street firm (that bears more than a passing resemblance to Lehman Brothers) at the beginning of the 2008 financial melt-down. It opens with the Firm laying off most of its middle managers in ruthless fashion. It quickly develops that the firm has recklessly invested in mortgage derivative products and is about to incur losses that will destroy it utterly. This develops with a reasonable amount of tension, but it is hard to make a movie exciting when the most dramatic moments are of a bunch of actors staring at a computer screen showing financial projections. There are a lot of scenes of executives looking at the numbers and dropping the F-bomb.This is an interesting movie and pretty true-to-life. Demi Moore, not usually a favorite of mine, plays to perfection her role as the Firm's risk management executive (whose negligence was key in destroying the firm.) The rest of the cast turns in pretty authentic performances and deserve kudos.Overall, this film comes together pretty well and highlights some aspects of the recklessness that led to the 2008 financial crisis.

1458590,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B005FITIGO,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 7]","Tell it to me ""as you might to a young child or a golden retriever."" , the business tycoon says to the risk management analyst at a key point in wirter-director J.C. Chandor's ""Margin Call.""It's a relief to hear the CEO of MBS, John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), want the story of Wall Street's mortgage-backed securities scandal revealed in frank terms. The first half of ""Margin Call"" - a fictionalized, ""inside"" recap of those first days during the 2008 market collapse - is spent with analysts pointing at screens and cursing a corporate blue streak in increasingly strained tones. Here, at last, is clarity.So the analyst, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) starts his response: ""over the  last 36-40 months the firm has begun  packaging new MBS products that combine  several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security.""That's Chandor's idea of clarity.His script swiftly moves to a musical chairs analogy without ever quite explaining the damn thing at the middle of it. Chandor's choice is to vacillate between minute details that are interesting but meaningless - sort of a phony authenticity - and broad analogies featuring crapbags, crapshows, and bridge-building in West Virginia.In short, no matter what virtues ""Margin Call"" might have, it's a little inane.Critics lauded Chandor for what he achieved on a small budget, but it's a short-term praise afforded any movie that sticks it to Wall Street. Even in the midst of the movie's crisis moments, Chandor's characters - perhaps excluding Sam Rogers, played by Kevin Spacey - seem awfully impressed with themselves. Or maybe the actors hating their own characters enough to preen through speeches in a way that makes the characters seem ugly. At any rate, ""Margin Call"" plays worse than a documentary on the same subject. You'll certainly learn much less.It opens with Sam laying off half of the MBS employees on a given floor - including risk management boss Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci). MBS is cold about how it dismisses Eric, who nevertheless manages to slip Peter, his former employee, a disk with some startling analysis on it. After Peter connects all the dots, the data will trigger a fire sale to end all of them.In a nutshell: Banks approved too many home mortgage loans to too many people who couldn't afford them, under the presumption that, once they jacked up the interest rates on the loans, the ""American Dream"" of owning a home was the kind of responsibility that no soul would dare default on. Banks were wrong. People defaulted. A lot. And since banks had ""projected"" much bigger gains on these mortgages - based on ludicrously high interest rates - than what actually came in, a bubble formed on their value. And the bubble burst. The investments weren't wroth squat.""Margin Call"" boils that explaination down to Peter, Sam and Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) pointing at a printout, then reporting the news to Jared (Simon Baker) and Sarah (Demi Moore), who have been promoted to their jobs for their looks and ability to prattle on in a sophisticated, empty matter. So they all call John Tuld, who wants to sell everything before the rest of Wall Street finds out what MBS knows.The climax of ""Margin Call,"" if you will, is whether Sam, the sales floor boss, will deliver a rousing-enough speech for that sale to happen. Since it's Spacey delivering that speech - and few can speechify like Spacey - you can figure it out.Vagueness looms over the movie like smoke. Maybe that's Chandor's point - numbness. The script is tinged with cynicism and shifts sympathies from Peter - the math whiz who used to be a rocket scientist - to Sam. Quinto, a boring actor, also co-produced, and keeps Peter's emotions buried under his intelligence. Spacey is resurgent in a role that combines venal showmanship and a conflicted conscience. Irons opts for an annoying, caustic Brit vibe.Chandor has a terrific story; he'd been working in commercial/documentary film for 15 years, banged out the ""Margin Call"" script in four days between job interviews in Boulder, Colo. Chandor's dad worked in investment banking, so his access to the interior lives of those people should have been good. And Academy Award voters clearly agreed; his script was nominated for an Oscar.But Chandor doesn't play fair. When a character asks for plain talk, he's asking on behalf of the audience. When the response is muddled and technical - and the rest of the movie is, too - it's a dodge. Artful, yes. - but a still a dodge. ""Margin Call"" prefers to be admired better than understood.

Barring any unexpectedly amazing film to come out later this year, this looks to be the best film of the year by far.While the setting (Wall Street) and the characters (high salaried businessmen) aren't that unusual, the way the film presents its ""did it all really go down this way in 2008?"" storyline is perfect. Just enough is said when it needs to be while the film carefully stays out of being too cinematically predictable in its presentation. It strikes up memories of the amazing film Startup.com, a documentary detailing the complexities at a company born to live fast and die even faster (and how petty human behavior could make or break large organizations).The cinematography is excellent, the soundtrack interesting and well-scored and the overall ""feel"" of the film matches that of the story: Polished, reserved and cold (like the city presented in the film), while at the same time humanistic and selfish. It's difficult to find any one character you will like, but for some folks in the film, you would be hard pressed to find yourself behaving much differently, given the situation, if you really think about it (given what it'd take to even get to where they were). That's why films like this are important. They give us insight into what people unlike ourselves might behave like.The true story of what happened in 2008 just before the collapse will probably never be truly known or properly connected together (in a coherent, non-biased manner), but what is known is that ultimately, history will always repeat itself due to humanity's greed.

The scene where the employees are being called in to be sacked hit me in the gut.  Seventeen years ago I was riffed at a blue-chip law firm; rumors had been spreading and I knew I was to be one of them.  It was cold and heartless.  The most experienced and higher-paid employees were let go and we immediately had to clear out our desks and lockers.  I barely had time to run around and say goodbye to friends.  You go through that once and the experience never leaves you even though I was lucky to get a job immediately and I've been retired for several years.  That scene just made me relive that agony all over again.  I now know how my father must have felt being laid off during the Great Depression even though he got a job as a printer and eventually was recalled.  (The war helped him be reinstated; war is good for business, at least it was then.)Kevin Spacey was amazing in his depiction of a man wrestling with his conscience.  The scene where he is crying over the impending death of his dog also hit home.  I understood that perfectly but it also let you into the character of Sam, a man who feels deeply not only about his dog but about the effects on people of what is about to happen and sends him into a crisis of conscience.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand the implications of what is happening.

It's a financial drama, depicting events leading up to the last stock market crash in 2008.The movie begins with a scene showing Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) being laid off. He's in risk management for an investment company. When he's informed of the decision, he's escorted back to his office to pick up his belongings, and then made to leave the building. His phone service is immediately terminated and he's told to forget about anything he was working on as it's no longer his problem. But Dale hands a USB drive to a colleague before he leaves, advising him to be careful.The colleague is Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), who takes a look at Dale's research when everyone else has left the office. His findings set in motion a series of events taking place over 24 hours, during which we are shown how a financial crisis might be handled.Many scenes involve people looking at computer screens and talking about the worrying implications, but the excellent screenplay makes us anticipate what is coming next. There is a little technical jargon, but it doesn't matter if you don't understand anything about Mortgage Backed Securities. The beauty of the story is in showing the chain of command, and the way in which people respond to the unfolding events.We see the problem being talked about by Sullivan and a junior analyst, and they decide to tell their immediate superior, Will (Paul Bettany). He then calls in his boss, Sam (Kevin Spacey). As the night wears on, a series of meetings take place. Other department heads are called in, and ultimately the man who decides the overall strategy (Jeremy Irons). Eric Dale cannot be traced, and the decision to terminate his services causes problems to all concerned.My favorite scene involves Dale talking about his former career as an engineer. He reveals how much of a difference one man can make, and shows some of the traits which earned him his job in risk management.The movie depicts leadership, reaction to stress, and how a strategy was devised to resolve the situation with as little damage to the company as possible. Ruthless decisions were called for and made, and the story has an undeniable ring of truth at every turn. That's not surprising when you realize that director J.C. Chandor's father worked for Merrill Lynch for 30 years.Margin Call is a movie that's well-written, well-acted,and surprisingly gripping. It might even make you question your investment strategy. Although I loved Wall Street, I think Margin Call is my favorite story set in the world of finance.Overall score 4.5/5",5,"A gripping drama, despite the potentially dry subject matter",1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,2723,"['*This', 'review', 'spoilers*It', 'achievement', 'make', 'movie', 'boring', 'subject', 'keep', 'viewer', 'engaged', 'Margin', 'Call', 'just', 'financial', 'drama', 'depicting', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'last', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', '2008.The', 'movie', 'scene', 'showing', 'Eric', 'Dale', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'being', 'laid', 'off', 'risk', 'management', 'investment', 'company', 'When', 'informed', 'decision', 'escorted', 'back', 'office', 'pick', 'up', 'belongings', 'then', 'made', 'leave', 'building', 'phone', 'service', 'immediately', 'terminated', 'told', 'forget', 'anything', 'was', 'working', 'no', 'longer', 'problem', 'Dale', 'USB', 'drive', 'colleague', 'advising', 'be', 'careful.The', 'colleague', 'Peter', 'Sullivan', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'who', 'look', 'Dale', 'research', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'left', 'office', 'findings', 'set', 'motion', 'series', 'events', 'taking', 'place', '24', 'hours', 'are', 'shown', 'how', 'financial', 'crisis', 'might', 'be', 'handled.Many', 'scenes', 'involve', 'people', 'looking', 'computer', 'screens', 'talking', 'worrying', 'implications', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'anticipate', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'little', 'technical', 'jargon', ""n't"", 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'anything', 'Mortgage', 'Backed', 'Securities', 'beauty', 'story', 'showing', 'chain', 'command', 'way', 'people', 'respond', 'unfolding', 'events.We', 'see', 'problem', 'being', 'talked', 'Sullivan', 'junior', 'analyst', 'decide', 'tell', 'immediate', 'superior', 'Will', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'then', 'boss', 'Sam', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'night', 'wears', 'series', 'meetings', 'take', 'place', 'Other', 'department', 'heads', 'are', 'called', 'ultimately', 'man', 'who', 'overall', 'strategy', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Eric', 'Dale', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'traced', 'decision', 'terminate', 'services', 'problems', 'concerned.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Dale', 'talking', 'former', 'career', 'engineer', 'how', 'much', 'difference', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'make', 'traits', 'earned', 'job', 'risk', 'management.The', 'movie', 'leadership', 'reaction', 'stress', 'how', 'strategy', 'was', 'devised', 'resolve', 'situation', 'as', 'little', 'damage', 'company', 'possible', 'Ruthless', 'decisions', 'were', 'called', 'made', 'story', 'undeniable', 'ring', 'truth', 'turn', 'not', 'surprising', 'when', 'realize', 'director', 'J.C.', 'Chandor', 'father', 'worked', 'Merrill', 'Lynch', '30', 'years.Margin', 'Call', 'movie', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'surprisingly', 'gripping', 'might', 'even', 'make', 'question', 'investment', 'strategy', 'loved', 'Wall', 'Street', 'think', 'Margin', 'Call', 'favorite', 'story', 'set', 'world', 'finance.Overall', 'score', '4.5/5']",Margin Call

And that is that none of these people at the top really know what is transpiring out there in their Never, Never Land of electronic trading; they don't understand the ramifications of their ""leaps and straddles"", "" butterflies and compound derivatives leverage"" because they never had to;  and rely entirely on underlings that don't, for the most part have a good understanding either; that silence is bought, used and trod on as long as is practical;  and that financial instruments the world markets depend on (and the individual investor who has been sold the biggest bill of goods) are knowingly spun out of thin air and kept circulating in a round-robin tail chasing scenario that catches the tail up to the head every decade or so.  There is no incentive to correct, because the Piper is always paid in full by those on the lower levels and has no need to use his flute. (calliope may be a better choice here)  The movie didn't go far enough though because there is the ""next act"" -  the men of hindsight who come in to ""fix"" things are the same men of vision that were always there - and a new decade begins anew with a fresh set of suckers.Kevin Spacey does his usual good job as Sam, the ""yes man"" department head who is relied upon by Jeremy Irons to keep things lined out - Irons gives the performance that really comes across as the most believable character portrayal of the film - that of the ruthless, untouchable head of a Wall Street trading and financial clearing firm.  He epitomizes the nature of the beast.  Sam buries his beloved dog the same night he has lost everything else, but it wasn't only the dog that died penniless.This film belongs in the category with ""Wall Street"" - although it may never achieve the same status - and I recommend it.

Instead of the fantasy which is ""Wall Street"" they got the reality which is this film - and they prefer to be bamboozled.Having worked on Wall Street and for Lehman Brothers, I can assure the prospective viewer that ""Margin Call"" is a realistic depiction of reality. The film probably is frustrating for viewers who have no idea what an ""MBS"" is (mortgage-backed-security), or a ""sub-prime mortgage"", nor what was at stake in the crisis 24 hour period that this film treats. So let me help those of you thinking about viewing this film...""Margin Call"" attempts to deal with the first 24 hours wherein Lehman Brothers, Inc. came to grips with the reality that their massive holdings in mortgage backed securities was a house of cards about to topple. At stake here is not piddling issues like the bankruptcy of a mere car company like General Motors, but an investment brokerage company whose default could precipitate a world wide financial collapse. Ignorant reviewers who find this film ""dull"" and ""boring"" have no idea there are watching actors portray persons - just a tiny handful of persons - who are aware that their decisions and actions within a 24 hour period could make or break Western Civilization. The persons portrayed had no idea that the United States government would eventually intercede with billions in bail out money (not to save Lehman Brothers, but with the purpose to contain further damage).Someone describing this film as dull, is like someone describing as dull the decision making and dialogue within the White House during the Cuban Missile crisis.Buy this movie and enjoy it.

Tell me we didn't wrap up this financial (thriller? morality play) with Kevin Spacey digging a shallow grave for his dead dog.  Oh, and then fade to black WITH THE SOUND OF HIM DIGGING?  Whatever.I'm not even sure how this was so boring.  Boring car rides, boring phone calls, boring meetings.  If you haven't seen it, here's the summary.  Essentially every part of the movie that involes Paul Bettany talking is awesome and every other plodding minute is as dull as an hour of C-Span.Honestly, there were two separate interludes of guys in cars looking for Stanley Tucci. Having bizarre boring unreal discussions which I think are supposed to be commentary on the culture but who would care.  The speech that Tucci gives about the bridge he built is completely ridiculous, I know given the culture, the message has to be that Wall Street is the blood sucker vampire on the neck of humankind and that being a bridge builder and CREATING something is god's real goal for us but COME ON! This was only a half notch above Stupid Shia Le Bouef's speech to his Mom about being a nurse in Wall Street 2 and that was an abomination.Zachary Quinto and the other guy were devoid of any charisma (OF COURSE HE WAS A ROCKET SCIENTIST!).  Poor Demi Moore was wasted and every scene I watched her in made me want to shut this off and watch Disclosure instead even with that movie's ridiculous e-mail graphics.  Spacey, Tucci, Irons are all good but it makes my head hurt that you put this cast together for this dirge.  Although I will say the HR department at this bank is really on their game.  You decide to fire someone at 6:30, you got a release signed and comp package drawn and done at 6:53.Of course there were two separate scenes of people crying.  I've worked in professional offices for 20 years and have seen maybe ZERO people crying but I guess this is a super emotional bank.I know there's no possible way that this isn't hailed as an all-time great given the culture right now so I'll accept three ""not helpful"" votes and be on my way, but in the Pantheon of financial movies I am going to go ahead and rank this below Wall Street, American Psycho, Boiler Room, Glengarry, hell, the Secret of My Success, Trading Places, Rogue Trader.

This review contains some early plot synopsis for those who may have some trouble with the Wall Street jargon. The film appears to be about a fictional investment firm at the start of the 2008 financial crisis.The drama opens with an investment bank downsizing. An outside agency has been hired to do the layoffs. We see sad scenes of people being tapped and escorted out. This company laid off much of its middle level management layers and kept the worker bees. Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), a big boss is visibly upset. He has a bottle of Pepto-Bismo on his desk. His Chocolate Lab is dying. Spacey is spending $1,000 a day to keep his dog alive. While he appears to be reviving his role in ""Horrible Bosses""  we later find out he is our closest thing to a good guy.One of the laid off mid-level bosses, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) hands off a thumb drive to Seth Bregman (Zachary Quinto) who burns the midnight oil going over the data. Bregman panics at the numbers. The volatility index (VI) indicates the company will incur losses that will greatly exceed its total assets. The firm goes into panic mode. The company holds bad assets known as derivatives which is nothing more than pieces of various risk mortgages lumped together. If they attempt to dump them all, without buying, people will suspect something is up and won't buy their assets. If they wait too long to dump them, the fear is someone else will figure out what is going on and beat them to the punch. They are between the proverbial ""rock and a hard place.""This sets the wheels in motion as the CEO is notified that the company may collaspe.Penn Badgley views their job as legalized gambling. They make $250,000 a year crunching numbers and think their bosses who make $2.5 million a year are obscenely overpaid. Jeremy Irons plays the stereotypical CEO who doesn't seem knowledgeable about their product.Now in spite of the fact this is dealing with issues beyond most people's lives, everyone one of us knows the results of an economy crash.

Paul Bettany, as the hotshot yet dissatisfied trading manager, looks like a young, twitchy Ed Harris.  Simon Baker, though not nearly as loud, is more than reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's character Blake.  Could just be my imagination though, as could this: Stanley Tucci, playing the sacked quant who first spots the financial blowup coming, closely resembles Nassim Nicholas Taleb, of Black Swan fame, who also predicted the 2008 crash.  Director and screenwriter J. C. Chandor was very clever to put these allusions into the film, if indeed he did.The superb ensemble acting is the main draw here.  Jeremy Irons fully redeems the cliched Slimey Limey villain role he's given.  Kevin Spacey is great as the seen-it-all veteran who discovers that he has not in fact ever seen anything like the looming catastrophe he must now manage.  Penn Badgley and Zachary Quinto do a fine job as the newbies who suddenly find themselves in deep water, Quinto to be promoted and Badgley to be canned.  I've seen Demi Moore in so many bombs, that it's very good to see her excel in a movie of substance here.

1458631,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B005FITIGO,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[3, 4]","I awaited the release of this film since I saw the fine documentaryInside Jobwhich is--as is any documentary--superior to the drama. Indeed, I had just shown my brother and Sister in law the documentary to prepare them for this film. The drama and the documentary did serve to complement each other.I'll try not to give anything away in my review. But there is one symbol initially of dubious relevance that sort of glues it together--a little like the harps in the background of a Wagner opera. It's the death of a dog. It's germaine only in that the dog is the only item of REAL value in Sam Rogers' (Kevin Spacey's) life.The film starts with something we have grown to expect in these days of economic decline: a mass firing. The supervisor of those getting fired was Eric Dale, played by Stanley Tucci. He too was canned. Then Rogers gave a rah rah speech, so one might thing he's among the bad guys. But not necessarily.There is one literal rocket scientist on the staff, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto--only a partial change from his role as a young Spock in the last Star Trek thriller). After earning his Ph.D. from MIT, he took a job in the ""market"" because money was better. Because of his mathematical expertise, he realized something was going wrong in some data Eric had passed to him, while saying, ""Be careful."" I don't want to say what it is and spoil the mystery. But the word spread rapidly that that the company is soon to be worth nothing. ""What do we do?"" the company aristocracy asked rhetorically, as they knew what they were going to do anyway, despite the consequences.As to the characters, it was rather obvious that John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) was in charge. And to call him ""unscrupulous"" is to be diplomatic, if not wishy washy. I was a bit more confused as to the corporate roles of Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) and Sarah Roberston (Demi Moore), though they seemed to be Tuld's lieutenants. Robertson agreed, reluctantly, to take a fall...with benefits.I'm realizing while writing this that I can't say much as there's too much to give away. But the film starts with how the story is ""Inspired by real events"" or something to that effect. So, one is forces to wonder, inspired how much? That's why I refer to the story as a parable: the company aristocracy, again, is willing to do whatever they feel they need to do despite the effects on anyone else in the world. That seems to be archetypical in today's market. Spacey did a fabulous job of displaying his internal struggle, by which I suggest he's not as much a ""bad guy"" as he might have seemed at the beginning of the film. One of my brother's favorite lines in the script was when the 23 year old Seth Bregman (Penn Badgley) who was making a quarter of a million a year shuffling paper said, ""This is all I wanted to do.""Overall I recommend the film, though, again, a documentary is always better. But both the Tucci and Spacey roles suggest that these people are human too, and perhaps it's to that human side that those of us who find these characters repulsive should try to appeal.",4,It's a worthwhile parable,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,3066,"['awaited', 'release', 'film', 'saw', 'fine', 'documentaryInside', 'Jobwhich', 'documentary', 'superior', 'drama', 'Indeed', 'had', 'just', 'shown', 'brother', 'Sister', 'law', 'documentary', 'prepare', 'film', 'drama', 'documentary', 'did', 'serve', 'complement', 'other.I', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'review', 'one', 'symbol', 'initially', 'dubious', 'relevance', 'sort', 'glues', 'together', 'little', 'harps', 'background', 'Wagner', 'opera', 'death', 'dog', 'germaine', 'only', 'dog', 'only', 'item', 'REAL', 'value', 'Sam', 'Rogers', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'life.The', 'film', 'something', 'have', 'grown', 'expect', 'days', 'economic', 'decline', 'mass', 'firing', 'supervisor', 'getting', 'fired', 'was', 'Eric', 'Dale', 'played', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'too', 'was', 'canned', 'Then', 'Rogers', 'gave', 'rah', 'rah', 'speech', 'one', 'might', 'thing', 'bad', 'guys', 'not', 'necessarily.There', 'one', 'literal', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'staff', 'Peter', 'Sullivan', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'only', 'partial', 'change', 'role', 'young', 'Spock', 'last', 'Star', 'Trek', 'thriller', 'earning', 'Ph.D.', 'MIT', 'took', 'job', 'market', 'money', 'was', 'better', 'mathematical', 'expertise', 'realized', 'something', 'was', 'going', 'wrong', 'data', 'Eric', 'had', 'passed', 'saying', 'Be', 'careful', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'what', 'mystery', 'word', 'spread', 'rapidly', 'company', 'soon', 'be', 'worth', 'nothing', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'company', 'aristocracy', 'asked', 'rhetorically', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'anyway', 'consequences.As', 'characters', 'was', 'rather', 'obvious', 'John', 'Tuld', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'was', 'charge', 'call', 'unscrupulous', 'be', 'diplomatic', 'not', 'wishy', 'washy', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'confused', 'corporate', 'roles', 'Jared', 'Cohen', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'Sarah', 'Roberston', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'seemed', 'be', 'Tuld', 'lieutenants', 'Robertson', 'agreed', 'reluctantly', 'take', 'fall', 'benefits.I', ""'m"", 'realizing', 'writing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'give', 'away', 'film', 'how', 'story', 'Inspired', 'real', 'events', 'something', 'effect', 'So', 'one', 'forces', 'wonder', 'inspired', 'how', 'much', 'why', 'refer', 'story', 'parable', 'company', 'aristocracy', 'again', 'willing', 'do', 'feel', 'need', 'do', 'effects', 'anyone', 'else', 'world', 'be', 'archetypical', 'today', 'market', 'Spacey', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'displaying', 'internal', 'struggle', 'suggest', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'bad', 'guy', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'beginning', 'film', 'One', 'brother', 'favorite', 'lines', 'script', 'was', 'when', '23', 'year', 'old', 'Seth', 'Bregman', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'who', 'was', 'making', 'quarter', 'million', 'year', 'shuffling', 'paper', 'said', 'wanted', 'do', 'Overall', 'recommend', 'film', 'though', 'again', 'documentary', 'always', 'better', 'Tucci', 'Spacey', 'suggest', 'people', 'are', 'human', 'too', 'perhaps', 'human', 'side', 'who', 'find', 'characters', 'repulsive', 'should', 'try', 'appeal']",Margin Call

1458633,A1H9DQ50934W11,B005FITIGO,Tom Fulery,"[7, 7]","One of the great themes of modern literature and film is the banality of evil. The casual, gradual descent of ordinary workaday life into increasingly unethical, socially destructive behavior, often without our being aware of it. So that when we finally realize it, it's too late; we're trapped. The small, routine, mundane lies we tell each other in the course of our jobs, to get ahead in business, to get the edge; to succeed, to win, can eventually add up to enormous consequences, as they do here. In an ethically bankrupt system, fudging the truth can seem necessary, because not to might put one at a disadvantage. And so deceit becomes invisible, accepted, habitual. Everybody does it because everybody does it. And before we know it, we're the bad guys.Like GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS, MARGIN CALL is a brilliant, unsettling look at the modern business environment, where the pressure to succeed damages not just the social fabric, but ourselves as well. Lying to each other is bad enough, but lying to ourselves is worse. In a system that rewards ruthlessness and punishes integrity, sociopaths rise to the top.There are no guns in this movie, no car explosions, no chase scenes, no digital FX, but MARGIN CALL is as dark, brutal and white-knuckle a portrait of evil as you're ever likely to see. The increasing sense of impending disaster is palpable, especially since you know where it's all headed. The characters are complex, finely-drawn and very human. And though no one is redeemed, they seem strangely sympathetic since we identify with (and pity) them, like hapless rats lost in a maze. As Jeremy Irons' character puts it, ""We can't help ourselves."" In the end, all are caught in their own traps, selling each other down the river because, as Kevin Spacey's character says, ""I just need the money.""But despite its grim subject, MARGIN CALL is too gripping to be depressing. And watching villains rationalize and justify themselves is always fascinating. It holds up a disturbing mirror to capitalism, so naturally some people won't like it. But it's a riveting, nuanced morality tale, told largely between the lines, and for those who grasp the larger implications, it is far more chilling than any action/thriller or horror movie.These Wall Street vampires are real.",5,"In a cutthroat society, don't be surprised if all that blood on your suit turns out to be your own..",1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,2279,"['One', 'great', 'themes', 'modern', 'literature', 'film', 'banality', 'evil', 'casual', 'gradual', 'descent', 'ordinary', 'workaday', 'life', 'increasingly', 'unethical', 'socially', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'often', 'being', 'aware', 'when', 'finally', 'realize', 'too', 'late', ""'re"", 'trapped', 'small', 'routine', 'mundane', 'tell', 'other', 'course', 'jobs', 'get', 'ahead', 'business', 'get', 'edge', 'succeed', 'win', 'can', 'eventually', 'add', 'up', 'enormous', 'consequences', 'do', 'here', 'ethically', 'bankrupt', 'system', 'fudging', 'truth', 'can', 'seem', 'necessary', 'not', 'might', 'put', 'one', 'disadvantage', 'so', 'deceit', 'becomes', 'invisible', 'accepted', 'habitual', 'Everybody', 'everybody', 'know', ""'re"", 'bad', 'guys.Like', 'GLENGARRY', 'GLEN', 'ROSS', 'MARGIN', 'CALL', 'brilliant', 'unsettling', 'look', 'modern', 'business', 'environment', 'where', 'pressure', 'succeed', 'damages', 'not', 'just', 'social', 'fabric', 'as', 'well', 'Lying', 'other', 'bad', 'enough', 'lying', 'worse', 'system', 'ruthlessness', 'punishes', 'integrity', 'sociopaths', 'rise', 'are', 'guns', 'movie', 'car', 'explosions', 'chase', 'scenes', 'digital', 'FX', 'MARGIN', 'CALL', 'dark', 'brutal', 'white-knuckle', 'portrait', 'evil', ""'re"", 'ever', 'likely', 'see', 'increasing', 'sense', 'impending', 'disaster', 'palpable', 'especially', 'know', 'where', 'headed', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'finely-drawn', 'very', 'human', 'one', 'redeemed', 'seem', 'strangely', 'sympathetic', 'identify', 'pity', 'hapless', 'rats', 'lost', 'maze', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'end', 'are', 'caught', 'own', 'traps', 'selling', 'other', 'river', 'because', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'just', 'need', 'money', 'grim', 'subject', 'MARGIN', 'CALL', 'too', 'gripping', 'be', 'depressing', 'watching', 'villains', 'rationalize', 'justify', 'always', 'fascinating', 'up', 'disturbing', 'mirror', 'capitalism', 'so', 'naturally', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'riveting', 'nuanced', 'morality', 'tale', 'told', 'largely', 'lines', 'who', 'grasp', 'larger', 'implications', 'far', 'more', 'chilling', 'action/thriller', 'horror', 'movie.These', 'Wall', 'Street', 'vampires', 'are', 'real']",Margin Call

1458639,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005FITIGO,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Largely set in the clean-looking office of an unnamed Wall Street investment firm, ""Margin Call"" offers a dramatized account of how a catastrophic financial collapse begins to emerge. No company is named, but we all know for sure where the film is really set. Written and directed by J.C. Chandor, whose screenplay was nominated for Oscar (Best Writing, Original Screenplay), ""Margin Call"" unfolds like a well-made stage play with an excellent cast including Penn Badgley, Simon Baker, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Kevin Spacey, Zachary Quinto and Stanley Tucci.The film starts with a sudden mass layoff of the firm's employees including Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), who has been in charge of risk management. In the scene (that reminds us of ""Up in the Air"") we sense something is not going well here. Before leaving the office, Eric gives a USB drive to a young analyst Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), warning him to ""be careful.""Late at night Paul manages to complete the task Eric was forced to leave unfinished. We know what he is about to learn. The company is doomed.""Margin Call"" works as a morality tale told against the backdrop of the recent financial collapse we still suffer. You don't have to know much about the financial markets (for those who need a comprehensive analysis of the crisis, there are several documentaries including ""Inside Job""). ""Margin Call"" is most effective when quietly describing how the firm's employees and CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) react to the disaster that is inevitable.Perhaps some might think with less subplots (a dying dog episode, for instance), ""Margin Call"" would have been slicker and more intense. Still, the director knows what he is doing and he does it very well. With superb acting all around, the film is engrossing and even suspenseful as a drama, even though we know where the story is going.",4,Eve of Destruction,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,1865,"['Largely', 'set', 'clean-looking', 'office', 'unnamed', 'Wall', 'Street', 'investment', 'firm', 'Margin', 'Call', 'dramatized', 'account', 'how', 'catastrophic', 'financial', 'collapse', 'emerge', 'company', 'named', 'know', 'sure', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'set', 'Written', 'directed', 'J.C.', 'Chandor', 'screenplay', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Margin', 'Call', 'unfolds', 'well-made', 'stage', 'play', 'excellent', 'cast', 'including', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Stanley', 'Tucci.The', 'film', 'sudden', 'mass', 'layoff', 'firm', 'employees', 'including', 'Eric', 'Dale', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'who', 'been', 'charge', 'risk', 'management', 'scene', 'Up', 'Air', 'sense', 'something', 'not', 'going', 'well', 'here', 'leaving', 'office', 'Eric', 'USB', 'drive', 'young', 'analyst', 'Peter', 'Sullivan', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'warning', 'be', 'careful', 'Late', 'night', 'Paul', 'complete', 'task', 'Eric', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'unfinished', 'know', 'what', 'learn', 'company', 'doomed', 'Margin', 'Call', 'morality', 'tale', 'told', 'backdrop', 'recent', 'financial', 'collapse', 'still', 'suffer', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', 'much', 'financial', 'markets', 'who', 'need', 'comprehensive', 'analysis', 'crisis', 'are', 'several', 'documentaries', 'including', 'Job', 'Margin', 'Call', 'most', 'effective', 'when', 'quietly', 'describing', 'how', 'firm', 'employees', 'CEO', 'John', 'Tuld', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'react', 'disaster', 'inevitable.Perhaps', 'might', 'think', 'less', 'subplots', 'dying', 'dog', 'episode', 'instance', 'Margin', 'Call', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'slicker', 'more', 'intense', 'Still', 'director', 'what', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'superb', 'acting', 'around', 'film', 'engrossing', 'even', 'suspenseful', 'drama', 'even', 'know', 'where', 'story', 'going']",Margin Call
1458640,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005FITIGO,Turfseer,"[21, 25]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Margin Call' is first time writer/director J.C. Chandor's distillation of the 2008 financial meltdown. Chandor creates a compilation firm based on Lehman Brothers and other Wall Street firms that tanked during the Wall Street economic crisis. The action is compressed down to one evening and a following morning despite the fact that the actual meltdown took place over a few months. The characters are entirely fictional and I heard that Chandor, during a talk at the new Lincoln Center film center, created the characters without consulting anyone specifically on Wall Street but then had some friends who were in the financial industry, look the script over once it had been completed.The plot is rather simple. Things come to head at Chandor's fictional firm, when seasoned risk management executive Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) is fired after another company downsizing. As he's being escorted from the building, he hands his subordinate, former physics ace, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), a flash drive containing a snapshot of the seemingly deteriorating financial situation at the firm (one wonders why 'security' allowed him to hand the flash drive over to Sullivan). A series of executives then are informed of the crisis, culminating in the arrival of the big boss, John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) who decides to sell off most of the company's assets resulting in big profits for the few executives and employees left at the firm but curtains for the rest of the underlings as well as a nasty kick in the pants to the overall US economy.Frankly, Chandor's attempt to dramatize the economic crisis is admirable but the subject matter doesn't really lend itself to palpable drama. Part of the problem is that many people (including myself) don't really understand how the financial system works. Chandor goes to great lengths to provide a simplified explanation for the financial collapse, but to be honest I still don't understand what it's all about, despite all of Chandor's attempts at transparency.Without a tension-filled plot, Chandor must fall back on strong characterizations of the principal players. Jeremy Irons really saves the day as CEO Tuld. Irons is the only actor amongst the solid cast, to turn his amoral financial executive into a flesh and blood human being. He also happens to have the best lines of dialogue in the script. Irons serves up a superb speech at the film's climax, detailing his cynical philosophy that financial downturns always occur in history and are unavoidable.The rest of the cast do their best in roles that are sorely underdeveloped. Quinto neatly conveys the integrity of a former ""rocket scientist"" who admits taking a job on Wall Street, simply ""for the money"". But Kevin Spacey struggles in his role as Sam, the ethical company man who refuses to quit because he also ""needs the money"". Chandor awkwardly attempts to humanize Spacey's Sam in the final scene, where the executive attempts to bury his recently deceased dog, under his ex-wife's lawn. The problem is that we don't find out enough about Sam to care about him. The same goes Paul Bettany as Will, whose main claim to fame is that he hangs out at strip clubs. Simon Baker does his best as the cold as steel executive Jared but he too lacks a back story. Ditto for Demi Moore's Sarah Robertson, who's thrown under the bus by CEO Fuld right before the big sell-off. Stanley Tucci ends up with the sorry sad sack role as the canned supervisor, who also throws principles to the wind by returning to the company one last time, after being threatened with retaliation by the sinking firm.Mr. Chandor must be commended for not only bringing the story of the the great 2008 financial collapse to the small screen but ensuring there were no happy endings. As in real life, the traders and executives broke no rules in this unregulated industry and hence were only guilty of ethical lapses, which of course were not punishable in a criminal court of law.There are those who may be satisfied with Chandor's sketchy and generic take on the financial collapse that precipitated the current financial downturn, but there are many more books and documentaries that will provide a more thoughtful and detailed reckoning of what really went on Wall Street during those heady times. If however, you wish to start with the basics, 'Margin Call' should be your baby.",3,Impressive Irons performance saves generic take on 2008 financial meltdown,1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,4399,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Margin"", 'Call', 'first', 'time', 'writer/director', 'J.C.', 'Chandor', 'distillation', '2008', 'financial', 'meltdown', 'Chandor', 'compilation', 'firm', 'based', 'Lehman', 'Brothers', 'other', 'Wall', 'Street', 'firms', 'tanked', 'Wall', 'Street', 'economic', 'crisis', 'action', 'compressed', 'down', 'one', 'evening', 'following', 'morning', 'fact', 'actual', 'meltdown', 'took', 'place', 'few', 'months', 'characters', 'are', 'entirely', 'fictional', 'heard', 'Chandor', 'talk', 'new', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'film', 'center', 'created', 'characters', 'consulting', 'anyone', 'specifically', 'Wall', 'Street', 'then', 'had', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'financial', 'industry', 'look', 'script', 'had', 'been', 'completed.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'simple', 'Things', 'come', 'head', 'Chandor', 'fictional', 'firm', 'when', 'seasoned', 'risk', 'management', 'executive', 'Eric', 'Dale', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'fired', 'company', 'downsizing', 'being', 'escorted', 'building', 'subordinate', 'former', 'physics', 'ace', 'Peter', 'Sullivan', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'flash', 'drive', 'containing', 'snapshot', 'seemingly', 'deteriorating', 'financial', 'situation', 'firm', 'one', 'why', ""'security"", 'allowed', 'hand', 'flash', 'drive', 'Sullivan', 'series', 'executives', 'then', 'are', 'informed', 'crisis', 'culminating', 'arrival', 'big', 'boss', 'John', 'Tuld', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'who', 'sell', 'off', 'most', 'company', 'assets', 'resulting', 'big', 'profits', 'few', 'executives', 'employees', 'left', 'firm', 'curtains', 'rest', 'underlings', 'as', 'well', 'nasty', 'kick', 'pants', 'overall', 'US', 'economy.Frankly', 'Chandor', 'attempt', 'dramatize', 'economic', 'crisis', 'admirable', 'subject', 'matter', ""n't"", 'really', 'lend', 'palpable', 'drama', 'Part', 'problem', 'many', 'people', 'including', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'how', 'financial', 'system', 'Chandor', 'great', 'lengths', 'provide', 'simplified', 'explanation', 'financial', 'collapse', 'be', 'honest', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'Chandor', 'attempts', 'tension-filled', 'plot', 'Chandor', 'must', 'fall', 'back', 'strong', 'characterizations', 'principal', 'players', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'really', 'day', 'CEO', 'Tuld', 'Irons', 'only', 'actor', 'amongst', 'solid', 'cast', 'turn', 'amoral', 'financial', 'executive', 'flesh', 'blood', 'human', 'being', 'also', 'have', 'best', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'script', 'Irons', 'up', 'superb', 'speech', 'film', 'climax', 'detailing', 'cynical', 'philosophy', 'financial', 'downturns', 'always', 'occur', 'history', 'are', 'unavoidable.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'best', 'roles', 'are', 'sorely', 'underdeveloped', 'Quinto', 'neatly', 'integrity', 'former', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'who', 'taking', 'job', 'Wall', 'Street', 'simply', 'money', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'role', 'Sam', 'ethical', 'company', 'man', 'who', 'quit', 'also', 'money', 'Chandor', 'awkwardly', 'humanize', 'Spacey', 'Sam', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'executive', 'attempts', 'bury', 'recently', 'deceased', 'dog', 'ex-wife', 'lawn', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'enough', 'Sam', 'care', 'same', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Will', 'main', 'claim', 'fame', 'out', 'strip', 'clubs', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'best', 'cold', 'steel', 'executive', 'Jared', 'too', 'back', 'story', 'Ditto', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Sarah', 'Robertson', 'who', 'thrown', 'bus', 'CEO', 'Fuld', 'right', 'big', 'sell-off', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'up', 'sorry', 'sad', 'sack', 'role', 'canned', 'supervisor', 'who', 'also', 'principles', 'wind', 'returning', 'company', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'being', 'threatened', 'retaliation', 'sinking', 'firm.Mr', 'Chandor', 'must', 'be', 'commended', 'not', 'only', 'bringing', 'story', 'great', '2008', 'financial', 'collapse', 'small', 'screen', 'ensuring', 'were', 'happy', 'endings', 'real', 'life', 'traders', 'executives', 'broke', 'rules', 'unregulated', 'industry', 'hence', 'were', 'only', 'guilty', 'ethical', 'lapses', 'course', 'were', 'not', 'punishable', 'criminal', 'court', 'law.There', 'are', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'satisfied', 'Chandor', 'sketchy', 'generic', 'take', 'financial', 'collapse', 'precipitated', 'current', 'financial', 'downturn', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'books', 'documentaries', 'will', 'provide', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'detailed', 'reckoning', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'Wall', 'Street', 'heady', 'times', 'however', 'wish', 'start', 'basics', 'Call', 'should', 'be', 'baby']",Margin Call
