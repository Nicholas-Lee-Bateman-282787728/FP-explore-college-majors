Lost is at its best with the original cast, everyone seems to hate new additions and I hate to say it but so do I. Of all the episodes from season 4, I only enjoyed half of them, maybe less. I really like this show so that's why I give it 4 stars, hopefully next season will really hit the mark.

1159843,A11EKP8L073NEY,B0018CWEYY,"A. M. Lewis ""Blueberry Ale""","[2, 2]","Season 4 of this incredibly addictive television series picks up where season 3 ended off... in the future (or the present...technically).  After three seasons of Lost, the format had begun to get a bit stale.  While flashbacks for newer characters such as Desmond, Ben and Juliet had made for some interesting episodes, many viewers became bored with Kate running, Sawyer conning and Jack pining.  Seeing this as well as any viewer could, the creators of Lost decided to switch things up a bit in the fourth season.  The ""flash forwards"" as they have come to be known added an intrigue to the show that hadn't been felt in quite some time.  Who are the Oceanic 6, what happened to the rest of the survivors of 815, how did the 6 escape the island, and who the hell is in the damn coffin!?!?! These were just a few of the questions posed (and answered, thankfully) in the fourth season.The fourth season also includes some of the finest episodes and acting of the entire series.  ""The Constant"" is 40 of the most emotionally gripping minutes of television you will ever see.  Henry Ian Cusick continues to make Desmond one of the more lovable and let's be honest, coolest characters on television.  In addition, Terry O' Quinn continues with the John Locke character where he was left off at the end of season 1.  That is as the most mysterious and captivating characters on television.  And of course, we can't mention John Locke without mentioning Benjamin Linus.  Mr. Michael Emerson does the impossible in this season.  He makes you actually feel bad for Benjamin Linus.  I challenge any other actor to do that.Well, I could go on and on.  I'll try to wrap this up by saying that save for one or two episodes like ""Eggtown"" and the eagerly awaited yet terribly disappointing  ""Meet Kevin Johnson"", this is a near perfect season from start to finish.  Even those episodes are far beyond worth watching.  So what are you waiting for?  Catch up, it's almost January!",5,"""It's not an island... it's a place where miracles happen""",1227225600,"11 21, 2008",2008,1967,"['Season', '4', 'incredibly', 'addictive', 'television', 'series', 'up', 'where', 'season', '3', 'ended', 'off', 'future', 'present', 'technically', 'three', 'seasons', 'Lost', 'format', 'had', 'begun', 'get', 'bit', 'stale', 'flashbacks', 'newer', 'characters', 'such', 'Desmond', 'Ben', 'Juliet', 'had', 'made', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'many', 'viewers', 'became', 'bored', 'Kate', 'running', 'Sawyer', 'conning', 'Jack', 'pining', 'Seeing', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'could', 'creators', 'Lost', 'decided', 'switch', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'fourth', 'season', 'flash', 'forwards', 'have', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'added', 'intrigue', 'show', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'felt', 'quite', 'time', 'are', 'Oceanic', '6', 'what', 'happened', 'rest', 'survivors', '815', 'how', 'did', '6', 'escape', 'island', 'who', 'hell', 'damn', 'coffin', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'questions', 'posed', 'answered', 'thankfully', 'fourth', 'season.The', 'fourth', 'season', 'also', 'finest', 'episodes', 'acting', 'entire', 'series', 'Constant', '40', 'most', 'emotionally', 'gripping', 'minutes', 'television', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'Henry', 'Ian', 'Cusick', 'make', 'Desmond', 'one', 'more', 'lovable', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'coolest', 'characters', 'television', 'addition', 'Terry', 'O', 'Quinn', 'John', 'Locke', 'character', 'where', 'was', 'left', 'off', 'end', 'season', '1', 'most', 'mysterious', 'captivating', 'characters', 'television', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mention', 'John', 'Locke', 'mentioning', 'Benjamin', 'Linus', 'Mr.', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'impossible', 'season', 'actually', 'feel', 'bad', 'Benjamin', 'Linus', 'challenge', 'other', 'actor', 'do', 'that.Well', 'could', 'go', ""'ll"", 'try', 'wrap', 'up', 'saying', 'save', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'Eggtown', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'yet', 'terribly', 'disappointing', 'Meet', 'Kevin', 'Johnson', 'near', 'perfect', 'season', 'start', 'finish', 'Even', 'episodes', 'are', 'far', 'worth', 'watching', 'what', 'are', 'waiting', 'Catch', 'up', 'almost', 'January']",N/A

This was one of those show when it was on the weekly line up that my family and I did not watch. The power went out and someone had given us the first full season on DVD so we pulled out the lap top and started watching. This was on a Friday evening and by the time Monday rolled around we were at a local store purchasing the rest of the seasons that were available. At the time season four was still being aired so and we caught it half way through the season. We vowed not to watch a single episode until we could purchase the whole season. It was some good family time when we knew we were all going to be lounging around for days watching nothing but Lost.

First, let me say that I have NEVER been a fan of flashbacks. However, I endured them, initially. Actually, I came to enjoy them during season 1. The backstory helped define the characters. Once the action shifted to the Others, I managed to watch most of the past of the new characters, though I was beginning to grow tired of the constant shifting and fast-forwarded some.BUT, toward the end of season 3, they showed Jack & Freckles off the island and I wondered. They have revealed the full complement of the so-called &#34;Oceanic 6&#34; AFTER they've left the island. So, instead of getting BACKSTORY, we are now getting &#34;forward-story!&#34; How's that for suspense? Someone (Jack?) even mentioned going back to the island for the rest.Sorry. Cheers to all of you who eat this up, but I cannot abide it. I mean, when they cut back to the &#34;present&#34; and we see a character in a life-threatening situation, we already know they can't die since we have seen the future. Unreal.To me, the best episode so far (in season 4) involved Desmond's being caught in the &#34;time warp.&#34; You see, I don't mind things that stretch the bounds of believability, but I despise seeing what happens before it happens. This episode has little (or none) of the scenes from the various cities the escapees ultimately make it to.I have been buying Lost one season at a time. I hate to waste money, so I will finish out the discs, but it is highly unlikely I will but the next one. Oddly, the same thing happened with &#34;Buffy.&#34; Season 4 was a complete turn-off to me.

I'm finding the never-ending plot twists and new characters so hard to follow that I'm losing interest in the series.

And yes, I bought several seasons and sat and watched them for hours and hours, back-to-back (recovering from surgery).  Season four is the first time I've found that the writers seem to be grasping at straws in order to keep the story going.

1159849,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B0018CWEYY,B. Martin,"[0, 0]","For a while it seemed that Lost was going to fade away into the ether of exciting and relevant television that had become tired and aimless (see The X-Files for a prime example of this phenomenon).  The first two seasons of Lost were highly popular and acclaimed, but by season three most fans and critics seemed ready to put the show out to pasture.  It was moving too slow.  There were too many questions and not enough answers.  People just stopped caring.  But then the show's creators took a major gamble and set the stakes high by reinventing the series with the finale of season three.  Suddenly, the show had regained its focus and had a new sense or purpose.  Couple that with the announcement that the show would be ending in 2010 following three shortened seasons that would pull everything together and Lost was back in a major way.  Most series usually run out of creative steam and then fumble around to find an ending that will satisfy fans.  But here was a series that had laid out a blueprint of when and how it was going to end.  This bold move was just what the show needed to recapture it's spark and to cement its place in television history.  For better or worse, Lost was going to end things on it's terms.The new shot of creative energy is apparent throughout the fourth season.  The episodes are lean and economical in their storytelling.  The pacing is faster than in the past and there is an inevitable sense of doom hanging over the series like a cloud.  Somehow you get the sense that when Lost finally ends, it's not going to be on a feel good high.Season 4 integrates the new flash forward story device that was introduced in the finale of Season 3.  As the season progresses we flash forward to learn what members of Oceanic 815 (known as the Oceanic 6) made it off the island and what problems they have run into since their rescue.  Meanwhile, in the present, we slowly learn how the things played out and why some did not leave the island.  New characters are introduced:  Danile Faraday, Miles Strom, Charlotte Lewis and Frank Lapidis consist of a crew sent to extract Ben from the island.  Why?  It turns out that the island is of interest to another party as well.  New alliances are formed as Jack and Locke go their separate ways after disagreeing about the true intent of their potential rescuers.  Meanwhile, Desmond is featured in another excellent episode, ""The Constant"" which may be one of the series' finest hours.  The episode not only holds pitvotal information that may be a key to the entire sereies, but it also is emotionally satisfying since it focuses on his tortured romance with Penny.Everything leads to a finale, that while not quite as shocking as ""Through the Looking Glass"", still delivers the goods and sets the table for the head spinning time travel antics of season 5.  All of this from a series that was nearly left for dead.  The end is drawing near on Lost and you can feel the forces gathering for what should be one heck of a finish.  If season 4 is any indication, that finish is going to hit like a ton of bricks.",5,The Beginning of the End,1254873600,"10 7, 2009",2009,3086,"['while', 'seemed', 'Lost', 'was', 'going', 'fade', 'away', 'ether', 'exciting', 'relevant', 'television', 'had', 'become', 'tired', 'aimless', 'see', 'X-Files', 'prime', 'example', 'phenomenon', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Lost', 'were', 'highly', 'popular', 'acclaimed', 'season', 'three', 'most', 'fans', 'critics', 'seemed', 'ready', 'put', 'show', 'pasture', 'was', 'moving', 'too', 'slow', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'not', 'enough', 'answers', 'People', 'just', 'stopped', 'caring', 'then', 'show', 'creators', 'took', 'major', 'gamble', 'set', 'stakes', 'high', 'reinventing', 'series', 'finale', 'season', 'three', 'Suddenly', 'show', 'had', 'regained', 'focus', 'had', 'new', 'sense', 'purpose', 'Couple', 'announcement', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'ending', '2010', 'following', 'three', 'shortened', 'seasons', 'would', 'pull', 'everything', 'together', 'Lost', 'was', 'back', 'major', 'way', 'Most', 'series', 'usually', 'run', 'creative', 'steam', 'then', 'fumble', 'find', 'ending', 'will', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'here', 'was', 'series', 'had', 'laid', 'out', 'blueprint', 'when', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'bold', 'move', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'show', 'needed', 'recapture', 'spark', 'cement', 'place', 'television', 'history', 'better', 'worse', 'Lost', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'things', 'terms.The', 'new', 'shot', 'creative', 'energy', 'apparent', 'fourth', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'lean', 'economical', 'storytelling', 'pacing', 'faster', 'past', 'inevitable', 'sense', 'doom', 'hanging', 'series', 'cloud', 'Somehow', 'get', 'sense', 'when', 'Lost', 'finally', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'feel', 'good', 'high.Season', '4', 'new', 'flash', 'forward', 'story', 'device', 'was', 'introduced', 'finale', 'Season', '3', 'season', 'flash', 'forward', 'learn', 'what', 'members', 'Oceanic', '815', 'known', 'Oceanic', '6', 'made', 'off', 'island', 'what', 'problems', 'have', 'run', 'rescue', 'Meanwhile', 'present', 'slowly', 'learn', 'how', 'things', 'played', 'out', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'island', 'New', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'Danile', 'Faraday', 'Miles', 'Strom', 'Charlotte', 'Lewis', 'Frank', 'Lapidis', 'consist', 'crew', 'sent', 'extract', 'Ben', 'island', 'Why', 'out', 'island', 'interest', 'party', 'as', 'well', 'New', 'alliances', 'are', 'formed', 'Jack', 'Locke', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'disagreeing', 'true', 'intent', 'potential', 'rescuers', 'Meanwhile', 'Desmond', 'featured', 'excellent', 'episode', 'Constant', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'series', 'finest', 'hours', 'episode', 'not', 'only', 'pitvotal', 'information', 'may', 'be', 'key', 'entire', 'sereies', 'also', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'tortured', 'romance', 'Penny.Everything', 'leads', 'finale', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'shocking', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'still', 'goods', 'table', 'head', 'spinning', 'time', 'travel', 'antics', 'season', '5', 'series', 'was', 'nearly', 'left', 'dead', 'end', 'drawing', 'Lost', 'can', 'feel', 'forces', 'gathering', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'heck', 'finish', 'season', '4', 'indication', 'finish', 'going', 'hit', 'ton', 'bricks']",N/A

After watching a few dozen episodes, it becomes clear that resolving all the plot lines is impossible. Don't bother to try. Just go along for the ride. The characters are damaged (lost) and that is intentional so try to not let that bother you. The show is addictive and at the end of each episode there is a hook that makes you want to immediately watch the next one. Remember that in television, the writers have to make it up as they go along. They never know when the show will be cut. That is why some plot lines eventually are forgotten. That's the reality of television. Accept it. Finally, I never had a greater involvement with a character than mine for Kate.

It was good, yes, at times very good, and yet....I wish it hadn't come down in exactly the way it did. A time or two I found myself internally screaming with frustration and walking away from the TV, only to return to the media room later, dying to know how things turned out. I'll admit this was my least favorite season of Lost, but it was still better than virtually anything else on commercial TV in this plot-deprived ""reality television"" decade. Making bold use of flashforwards (think of a flashback turned in the other direction) and showing bit by bit how these revealed moments were reached, this season ships in a boatload of real jerks who bring destruction and mayhem to everybody's favorite island, but it also introduces us to four outsiders whose stories intrigued me as little else has on Lost since season two. The fallout between Locke and Jack is tragic but Sawyer's long-building  redemptive moment on the helicopter with Hugo was sheer brilliance and proves for the hundredth time how evolving Lost's characters continue to be. And then there's that as yet unexplained final shot that reveals exactly who the furtive Jeremy Bentham was, though not why he came to be lying dead in a coffin. Not even Benjamin Linus' shadowy middle of the night confrontation with the sinister Charles Widmore rivaled that in sheer impact. The special features for this season didn't hold my attention as the ones in past DVD anthologies have, with ""The Right To Bear Arms"" coming off as downright misplaced on a Lost collection. I enjoyed the deleted scenes, though, the investigation into the conspiracies surrounding the downed flight, and the bit that showed how Lost's excellent soundtrack sees the light of day. There were also maybe the coolest Easter Eggs on this season's DVD's than in any season so far.Season four ultimately contained an inner weakness that was almost unavoidable because of the limitations of its shortened run-time, and because of its existence as in many ways a signpost directing us toward the as yet unaired season five. Whether in retrospect it comes to be regarded as brilliant in its own right or a stepping stone that bridges the old and new remains to be seen. One thing I will say without hesitation is that it's worth owning and it's worth watching.",4,"Dude, Where's My Island?",1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,2381,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'abbreviated', 'fourth', 'season', 'Gee', 'thank', 'writers', 'strike', 'was', 'good', 'yes', 'times', 'very', 'good', 'yet', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'come', 'down', 'exactly', 'way', 'did', 'time', 'two', 'found', 'internally', 'screaming', 'frustration', 'walking', 'away', 'TV', 'only', 'return', 'media', 'room', 'later', 'dying', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'turned', 'out', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'Lost', 'was', 'still', 'better', 'virtually', 'anything', 'else', 'commercial', 'TV', 'plot-deprived', 'reality', 'television', 'decade', 'Making', 'bold', 'use', 'flashforwards', 'think', 'flashback', 'turned', 'other', 'direction', 'showing', 'bit', 'bit', 'how', 'revealed', 'moments', 'were', 'reached', 'season', 'boatload', 'real', 'jerks', 'who', 'bring', 'destruction', 'mayhem', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'island', 'also', 'four', 'outsiders', 'stories', 'intrigued', 'little', 'else', 'Lost', 'season', 'two', 'fallout', 'Locke', 'Jack', 'tragic', 'Sawyer', 'long-building', 'redemptive', 'moment', 'helicopter', 'Hugo', 'was', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'proves', 'hundredth', 'time', 'how', 'evolving', 'Lost', 'characters', 'continue', 'be', 'then', 'as', 'yet', 'unexplained', 'final', 'shot', 'exactly', 'who', 'furtive', 'Jeremy', 'Bentham', 'was', 'not', 'why', 'came', 'be', 'lying', 'dead', 'coffin', 'Not', 'even', 'Benjamin', 'Linus', 'shadowy', 'middle', 'night', 'confrontation', 'sinister', 'Charles', 'Widmore', 'rivaled', 'sheer', 'impact', 'special', 'features', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'attention', 'ones', 'past', 'DVD', 'anthologies', 'have', 'Right', 'Bear', 'Arms', 'coming', 'off', 'downright', 'misplaced', 'Lost', 'collection', 'enjoyed', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'though', 'investigation', 'conspiracies', 'surrounding', 'downed', 'flight', 'bit', 'showed', 'how', 'Lost', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'light', 'day', 'were', 'also', 'maybe', 'coolest', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'season', 'DVD', 'season', 'so', 'far.Season', 'four', 'ultimately', 'contained', 'inner', 'weakness', 'was', 'almost', 'unavoidable', 'limitations', 'shortened', 'run-time', 'existence', 'many', 'ways', 'signpost', 'directing', 'yet', 'unaired', 'season', 'five', 'retrospect', 'be', 'regarded', 'brilliant', 'own', 'right', 'stepping', 'stone', 'old', 'new', 'remains', 'be', 'seen', 'One', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'hesitation', 'worth', 'owning', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

J.J. Abrams does a masterful job of keeping the intrigue and suspense meter on maximum with more twists and turns than a M. Knight Shyamalan movie. There are some definite unexpected events here that may make you rewind a bit to make sure that you saw what you saw.

1159860,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0018CWEYY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[19, 20]","LOST Season 4 started off with a bang.  In the final episode of Season 3, we see Jack finally getting an opportunity to go back home but having that opportunity being taken away from him.  We see the Others attack the camp of where the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 were staying but most of all, a significant death of a main character.  But what was even more surprising for everyone was to see Jack and Kate several years in the future.  With Jack telling Kate that they need to go back.This left fans with a significant hint that there are survivors who made it off the island.  But who were they?  Also, who will be rescuing the survivors or more like, are they even there to save them?There are so many things that happened in Season 4 that it would be too difficult to explain but I can tell you that the whole season was exciting and despite the writer's strike possibly hindering the amount of episodes in the season, ""LOST"" was able to capitalize with quality over quantity in a total of 13 episodes and boy did they deliver.""LOST - THE COMPETE FOURTH SEASON"" features the following episodes:1. The Beginning of the End2. Confirmed Dead3. The Economist4. Eggtown5. The Constant6. The Other Woman7. Ji Yeon8. Meet Kevin Johnson9. The Shape of Things to COme10. Something Nice Back Home11. Cabin Fever12. There's No Place Like Home (Part 1 of 2)13. There's No Place Like Home (Part 2 of 2)Again, I really don't want to spoil the season for anyone but I will say that the body count of this season is quite high and the amount of action is also quite high for the fourth season.  The storytelling was just awesome and the acting was well done.  Especially the final episode.  Absolutely fantastic!VIDEO:The video is featured in 1080p High Definition/1:78:1.  One of the first things you will notice is how the island just comes alive with the vibrant colors.  From the lush greens to the variation of blues from the sky to the ocean.  And yes, you will be able to see the pores, the wrinkles of each actor.  The picture quality was absolutely beautiful.  I did see a few scenes (low-light) where there was considerable noise.  But only a few scenes.AUDIO:The audio features are English 5.1 uncompressed (48khz/16-bit) and English and French in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Spanish in Dolby Digital 2.0.  During the action scenes or when you hear the music during a suspenseful scene, that is when you hear the audio being utilized.  Especially for this season due to the amount of explosions.  But overall, the audio is primarily dialogue.  You won't hear birds chirping or the oceans waves pounding from the island, but after watching the featurettes and the challenges of filming in public beaches and areas near traffic, I can understand the crew trying to make sure the dialogue came out clear and not trying to incorporate another noises that could have hindered the dialogue.SPECIAL FEATURES:The Blu-ray edition of ""LOST - THE COMPLETE SEASON FOUR"" definitely is full of special features.  Included are:* LOST in 8:15 - Learn about ""LOST SEASONS 1-3' in 8:15* The Right to Bear Arms - Guns are used a lot in ""LOST"" but because they are on an island, who has to track who has what weapon and how many weapons there are.  This featurette was quite interesting.* The Freighter Folk - A look at the new faces on this third season of people on that freighter* The Island Backlot: Lost in Hawaii - A fantastic featurette that is quite lengthy and shows how certain scenes have come to life on ""LOST"".  How certain countries around the world were all filmed in Hawaii and how post-production came through to make it look like it was filmed elsewhere. Very entertaining featurette.* The Oceanic Six: A Conspiracy of Lies - A very interesting 20+ minute documentary about those who challenge the inconsistencies of the Oceanic 6 survivors and research disputing the survivor's stories.  Very interesting!* Offshore Shoot - The building and shooting on the freighter* Lost - The Missing Pieces - These ""MOBisodes"" were featured on abc.com and there are certain scenes not shown on ""LOST"" that definitely shows missing pieces from previous seasons that actually make you think and wonder of past storylines.  Without spoiling this part for for anyone, I will talk about one which took place in the early parts of Season 1 between Sun and Michael.  Sun was burying her California ID which she was going to use after separating from her husband.  But Michael arrives and really listens to her.  The two nearly get romantic.  You never see this on Season 1.  You get a feeling that perhaps Michael may like Sun but you never see anything happen.  But after seeing this one MOBisode, you actually see both of them nearly kissing.* Soundtrack of Survival: Composing for Character, Conflict & the Crash - This section was on how the music is scored for ""LOST"" but also featuring the live performance of the Honolulu Symphony Pops.  The Blu-ray version features more live performances including ""The Others"" (uncut).* LOST on Location - Behind-the-scenes of the cast and crew* Course of the Future: The Definitive Flash-Forwards* LOST Bloopers* Deleted Scenes* Audio Commentaries - LOST fans will love the commentaries by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse.  The two have always had this cool chemistry and humor during their discussions since the first year and their old LOST podcasts and it continues.  More insight on the show and inside jokes.* SeasonPlay: This technology allows people to watch the episodes like watching it on television and even if you eject your Blu-ray to watch something else, when you put it back in to your player, it will remember where you last left off.* And much more...Like previous ""LOST"" Seasons on DVD and Blu-ray, there are also Easter Eggs.  In fact, there over 20 of them.  You can find many of them here.[...]I've owned every season of ""LOST"" on DVD and Blu-ray but the fourth season on Blu-ray is visually and audio appealing  for ""LOST"" fans, there are so many awesome bonus features, let alone Easter Eggs that you can't help but be content and happy with the overall product.The fourth season with it's gripping storyline, action and acting really made the fourth season quite enjoyable.  But the Blu-ray version really enhanced my love or this show due to the vibrant colors and just the beauty of the island and the audio quality but how many special features (that were quite lengthy) included on this box set.  You're getting your money's worth with this release.There are not many television shows on Blu-ray at this time but currently, I have to say that ""LOST - THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON"" is the best out there right now.  A total package and a must own for fans of the series!",5,LOST Season 4 on Blu-ray is not only beautiful but packed with extras!

The fourth season was cut down in size from the 16 episodes that were supposed to have been made from the writer's strike.  I can say that it was hard to top this season.Lost continues to be the best television show ever to grace television screens.  Twists and turns in every direction.  People who complain about not getting answers should watch the season finale, ""There's no Place Like Home.""Performances:  Michael Emerson continues to be the best character on the show, reaching his acting peak in,""The Shape of Things to Come.""  Severel new characters were introduced this season, the standouts being Jeremy Davies as Daniel Faraday, Jeff Fahey as Frank Lapidus, and Kevin Durand as Martin Keamy.  Henry Ian Cusick, Terry O'Quinn, Matthew Fox, Naveen Andrews.  Ther list goes on and on.Plot: The main plot of this season was the rescue of the Oceanic 6 from the Island.  We learned through flashforwards the things that occured to the Oceanic 6 when they returned to the real world.  This plot is ended by the end of the season, although now they have another mission: return to the Island.  The other plot arc this season was a freighter that supposedly came to rescue the Islanders.  Over time, they learn the true mission of the Freighter people: kill everyone on the Island.Music: The music continues to be breathtaking.  Michael Giachinno is a genius when it comes to emotional scores.  I have to give a shout out to the ""Dharmacide"" piece.  It plays when Ben goes to tell his daughter goodbye in this season's episode, ""The Shape of Things to Come.""  another new theme was introduced in the season finale, it plays when the Oceanic 6 return to the real world and see their family memebers.Overall, this is one of the greatest seasons of television ever.",5,Perhaps the best season so far!,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,1832,"['Last', 'night', 'season', 'finale', 'fourth', 'season', 'Lost', 'ended', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'size', '16', 'episodes', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'writer', 'strike', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'hard', 'top', 'season.Lost', 'be', 'best', 'television', 'show', 'ever', 'grace', 'television', 'screens', 'Twists', 'turns', 'direction', 'People', 'who', 'complain', 'not', 'getting', 'answers', 'should', 'watch', 'season', 'finale', 'Place', 'Home', 'Performances', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'be', 'best', 'character', 'show', 'reaching', 'acting', 'peak', 'Shape', 'Things', 'Come', 'Severel', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'season', 'standouts', 'being', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Daniel', 'Faraday', 'Jeff', 'Fahey', 'Frank', 'Lapidus', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'Martin', 'Keamy', 'Henry', 'Ian', 'Cusick', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'Ther', 'list', 'on.Plot', 'main', 'plot', 'season', 'was', 'rescue', 'Oceanic', '6', 'Island', 'learned', 'flashforwards', 'things', 'occured', 'Oceanic', '6', 'when', 'returned', 'real', 'world', 'plot', 'ended', 'end', 'season', 'now', 'have', 'mission', 'return', 'Island', 'other', 'plot', 'season', 'was', 'freighter', 'supposedly', 'came', 'rescue', 'Islanders', 'time', 'learn', 'true', 'mission', 'Freighter', 'people', 'kill', 'everyone', 'Island.Music', 'music', 'be', 'breathtaking', 'Michael', 'Giachinno', 'genius', 'when', 'emotional', 'scores', 'have', 'give', 'shout', 'Dharmacide', 'piece', 'when', 'Ben', 'tell', 'daughter', 'goodbye', 'season', 'episode', 'Shape', 'Things', 'Come', 'new', 'theme', 'was', 'introduced', 'season', 'finale', 'when', 'Oceanic', '6', 'return', 'real', 'world', 'see', 'family', 'memebers.Overall', 'one', 'greatest', 'seasons', 'television', 'ever']",N/A

However, the rescue only brings more danger.Three things about this season make it work. First, rather than flashbacks, this season contains several flashforwards. We see survivors cope with the effects of having escaped the island.Second, the new characters on the rescue team are individual and interesting enough to hold their own. They don't get star billings, but they're not ""red shirts"".Third, we see the characters make tough decisions and deal with very real consequences. I particularly liked how Sawyer's character matured.If I had one complaint about season 4, there are a bit too many times when characters didn't behave like themselves.

Is it possible that the best/safest place for our castaways is on The Island with The Others, Smokey, magnetic & time anomalies? Is it possible they shouldn't leave? That's the question Season 4 asks as life on the Island gets worse, but it's shown that life off the Island is even worse. Make no mistake about it, season 4 is quite different than the seasons proceeding it as the story starts building towards something, and the sci-fi elements of it get that much stranger. And oh the complexity!Highlight Episodes:The EconomistThe ConstantThe Shape of Things to ComeThere's No Place Like HomeNaturally with the more story-driven nature of the season, the characters are kind of pushed aside, but that's not totally on the fault of the series. While we are given new characters to get to know, we've already know inside and out the regular castaways. And probably the biggest fault of the ""flash-forwards"" is that we don't really get that much character development. We might see a new side of Kate, but it's Kate & it's a logical progression for the character I'm not exactly sure we needed to see. Sure, it sets up the later season, but I'm not convinced it really works in tangent with this season. It doesn't hurt the character development like Season 2 did, but it doesn't really help and/or do anything for them either. The lone exception to this however is probably Ben Linus, who progresses significantly then what we've seen of him previously. Plus, Michael Emerson could be doing nothing and I'd still be fascinated with him & his character.But again, Season 4 is focused primarily on the story. Sure, it may be slow towards the middle of the season, but there's just so many great moments here. The whole Freighter storyline is played well, and the foreshadowing and setting-up in this season is all compelling. And what's best is that besides being just fascinating to watch, it's also original, which is a great thing to say when a show is in its 4th year. I mean, I know ""The Constant"" has been praised to no end, but the episode just works so well as both a sci-fi and character piece. Make no mistake about it, an episode featuring Desmond is always a good one, and ""The Constant"" is one of the series' best.Overall, Season 4 is a thrilling ride, and it's worth the trek if only for ""The Constant"" and 'No Place Like Home.' It's not the best season, and it may not move the characters along as much as I would like, but its primary function is foreshadowing and setting up the events to come. It has so many great moments, both story & character-wise, making Season 4 well worth the trip.Real Score: 4.5/5",5,"""Was He Talking About What I Think He Was?""

I'm just not buying into the whole time travel, time looping, twisting,turning saga. I truly truly almost feel sorry for the serious actors of this series, because after listening to the bonus commentaries etc, you just have to know that they didn't know from the beginning that the series was going to become so nonsensical.  Making an island disappear  or ""move"" is just ummm STUPID.  Beyond that even, season 5 defies all human reason and is worse than Season 4.  I have no doubt that it's difficult to write a logical survival type program for 4 to 5 years, but GEEZ LOUISE, please don't assault the intelligence of your viewers THAT OFTEN and still expect them to watch your program!!!!!

A show that started out with such promise and managed to sustain a good head of steam through three seasons, bottoms out in season four.I suppose the screenwriters' strike had a lot to do with it.  They could only manage 14 episodes in the truncated season, and tried to make the best of it by giving you one out of the frying pan and into the fire scene after another.  Despite the clever use of ""flashforwards"" to move between the island and the mainland, the writers seemed lost as to where to take this series, relying way too much on Locke to carry the action when it just wasn't in his character to be a leader.  Jack, of course, rises to the occasion, and Sawyer has his moments.  However, as Ben turns the ancient wheel toward a new season, we know that the Oceanic 6 still hasn't left the island behind them.You just have to wonder how much this series has left in it.  Season Five has hardly been the most fulfilling entertainment either.  One hopes that when the time comes to finally put the lid on this series that the writers will find a way to resolve the many loose threads they now have dangling, after having introduced so many characters and so many overlapping storylines.

We learn that 6 passengers got off the island by flash forwards instead of flashback. The season just leads to a brilliant conclusion of how they actually got off the island and what happened to the people that didn't. In no way is this the season though since it still raises many questions in the finale and through-out the season.Sine season 3 ended with Jack calling a freighter to come rescue them eventhough Locke and Ben warned him that it would be a huge mistake. What do they know though,...Jack's a Doctor and Doctor's know everything due to years in college lol. But the all mighty brainiac does bring some harm to the island. Since one of the freighter guys is a big military nut that has been hired to bring Ben off the island. He doesn't care who he kills to succeed in his mission. So no, he can careless about rescueing them off the island.Kevin Durand has been seen in movies like 3:10 to Yuma and Wild Hogs but it's in Lost that he really shines as the military nut. Hell he would have been an awesome Punisher for Punisher 2! The other new cast members who are familiar from many movies are good as well. Jeff Fahey of Lawnmower Man and of Planet Terror does some of his better work as well as a helicopter pilot for the freighter guys. Ken Leung (X-Men 3) is perfect as a wiseass who has the ability to talk to the dead. His character is pretty interesting and I hope they do more with him in season 5. Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan) is another familiar face as a brainy guy who basically just wants to do...brainy stuff on the island lol. His brains can help sometimes and he seems pretty harmless but you never know when he's being honest to the castaways.Due to the season of being cut down due to the strike, we don't even get a Sawyer flashback. He is still however used well through-out the season and still one of the cooler guys of the show. The show still delivered a pretty solid season. It answers many questions while also being one of the more thrilling and unpredictable seasons. I'll also say that we find out who's in the coffin and many of us were dieing to know after season 3. Of course, I'm not going to give away who it is though.

1159887,A20U54S8PC1291,B0018CWEYY,J. McDonald,"[19, 30]","In my opinion, if someone compiled a list of the top ten drama TV series of all time, LOST would rank in the top THREE. The first season delivered a quality of writing, acting and overall execution not seen in most big budget Hollywood movies, let alone a weekly series. While it did falter for an episode or two within the following two seasons, there is no denying that LOST always quickly recouped and delivered enough substance and sheer brilliance to draw the viewer back into the ""zone"". The fact that such a high level of output was consistently maintained for THREE YEARS is an astonishing achievement. Another astonishing, and quite unfortunate achievement is how a series of this stature could be reduced to comic book schlock within a very short period of 14, poorly conceived and written ""season four"" episodes.Here's what I used to tell people who had never seen lost....""If you have avoided LOST on the assumption that it's sci-fi nonsense, or a simple survival tale, you have judged incorrectly. The character depth is remarkable, the acting superb, and the plot is MIND BENDING. If you're a viewer who enjoys sitting back and watching a series such as ""24"", thinking that you've reached the pinnacle of quality television, I urge you to watch the first few episodes of LOST. You'll never look at another TV show in quite the same way.""After watching the poorly written and executed season four, I can no longer make such a bold statement. In an effort to wrap up some of the mystery surrounding the first three seasons, the writers have chosen a direction that places character depth secondary to silly sci-fi nonsense. A truly powerful and unique human drama filled with mystery and intrigue has been reduced to entertainment for simpletons.> SPOILER WARNING &lt;Do not read beyond this point if you don't want basic plot points revealed.Within the first three seasons, we were all treated to various ""mysteries"", that may or may not have had ""sci-fi"", ""scientific"", or ""spiritual"" tinged answers. Each new mystery was carefully constructed and thoughtfully intertwined with the development of each individual character. The perfectly balanced combination of mystery and character development became the CORE of Lost. Unfortunately, within season four, heavy handed writing destroys most of the fragile plot line developed within the first three seasons. Even the plot structure is discarded in a few episodes. Season four hits the viewer between the eyes with nonsense and outlandish situations, which are almost entirely devoid of mystery.Ghosts? Yes, they exist. Time travel? Yes, not a problem. Time/Space travel? Of course! Oh, and the mysterious ""smoke monster"" can be controlled from a hidden room (Jeeez, how pathetic)! The island can be ""moved"" by turning a big wheel (of course). Let's also throw in an old as dirt plot device (like trying to disarm a bomb before it explodes), and then throw in some Rambo-like soldiers as bad guys (to get more action into the series)! Characters became CARICATURES as the center of attention shifts to a silly comic book ""war"" between ""Ben"" and Charles Widmore (who are perhaps a couple of time/space travellers).For a while, I was concerned that the resolution of LOST might ultimately disappoint by being a bit too reminiscent of various movie plot lines (Vanilla Sky, the Fountain, Dark City, What Dreams May Come, Twelve Monkeys, etc.). But now, if the series proceeds in the direction that season four has laid out, LOST isn't even in the league of many of those films. Instead, we might end up comparing it to something of the ilk of Highlander. Sad indeed!I'm sure that lots of viewers have simply given up on the series after the silly revelations of season four. I'm still looking forward to season five, but am less than hopeful that the writers can fix all that they have destroyed.

1159888,AL9WKVMRI6GFB,B0018CWEYY,JMM,"[0, 1]","Lost Season 4 is considerably shorter than the previous seasons of 23-24 episodes.  With just 13 episodes, it seems as though you'd be getting less value.  But what you actually get is less time wasted (as with Season 3) and more dense episodes that are packed with information.  The big change in Season 4 is the extensive use of flash-forwards, so that we actually begin to learn who will eventually make it off the island.  It is soon discovered that six people made it back to the real world; this group comes to be known as the Oceanic Six.  Just who is in the Oceanic Six is the mystery, as they are revealed one by one as the season progresses.  Seeing how these people, Jack in particular, have changed post-crash is one of the highlights of season 4.Season 4: ""The Expanded Experience"" is a 6-DVD set.  The first four discs are devoted to the episodes, and the last two are for bonus material.  There are some interesting bonus features this season, including ""The Island Backlot"" and ""The Freighter Folk"".  Also included is a ""Lost in 8:15"" segment to briefly catch up those who are rusty on their Lost facts.  ""The Oceanic Six: A Conspiracy of Lies"" is a fictional documentary that is quite amusing and well-made.  ""The Right to Bear Arms"" is a feature that explains that it is actually someone's job to keep track of which characters have which guns at any given point in time.  As usual, there are several cast commentaries, plus one with show creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse.  I find the commentaries to be less informative than I would have hoped.The Season 4 packaging remains constant with the first three seasons, although the episode guide booklet is replaced with a less-important but humorous Oceanic safety brochure.

1159890,A1AT0GONN4A9NA,B0018CWEYY,"John P. Morgan ""Light Coach""","[10, 14]","I've been a ""lostie"" from the very beginning. I didn't catch it on the reruns...I didn't borrow someone's DVDs...I was right there from the very beginning and I knew from that very first episode that LOST was not just another show.It's a show that requires thinking and not to sound elitist or anything, but thinking is kind of a lost art - no pun intended - this show forces you to pay attention and look not only at what's happening in the forefront, but also at what's taking place in the background. Of course, this cannot be done with a single viewing and there have been many episodes that I have watched over and over noticing little things here and there that I may not have noticed before. Most of us tend to think that just because we have seen something once we know all there is to know about something. This is a false as well as a dangerous assumption because we never really know all there is to know about anything - ourselve included.Of course, most people don't want to invest their time in something that requires so much thinking. Most people want to be entertained. But not only is this show a ""thinking person's"" show, it is also a highly entertaining show, as well and this season really packed a whallop with each and every episode.If there was anything good that came from the writer's strike, it was this season because it forced the writers to really cut back on excess storylines and make each episode tight and to the point. There were a couple of episodes where I just sat there long after the credits rolled up just in total amazement at how incredibly powerful one show could be and if you think that I'm that I'm just gushing to gush, think again.Michael Emerson, the actor who portrays the character Ben, is such a convincing actor on every level. He really makes you think about this character; who is he, really? Why is he the way he is? What are his true intentions? And not only do you think about him, you really feel for this character - at least, I do. He runs the range of human emotions from being downright evil to compassionate and concerned. He's a living, breathing dichotomy and if we're honest with ourselves, most of us are.Someone suggested that this show is ""ridiculous"". This show is anything but ridiculous. It may leave you scratching your head, it may have you running to your computer and googling a name like Jeremy Bentham to see what possible information can be uncovered or discovered about that particular person, but it is never ridiculous.The creators of this show decided that they were going to tell a story and sometimes stories have to go a long way to unravel themselves fully and completely but the person who stays with the story is ultimately rewarded. I trust the creators of the show. I firmly believe that they know where they are going with this show and it won't end in some way like it was ""all just a dream"" in a character's mind or it was a child's ""snowglobe"" or anything remotely similar. I think it will end like it started - a complete mind blower. Most television shows don't want to ""blow minds"". They want the viewer to feel ""comfortably numb"" and safe.True safety lies not in the known but in the unknown and if you are willing to take the time to get ""LOST"" you will be ultimately rewarded in the long run.Peace and Blessings all you losties,john 'the Light Coach'",5,Holy Smoke Monster...What A Great Season!,1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,3353,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'lostie', 'very', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'reruns', 'did', ""n't"", 'borrow', 'someone', 'DVDs', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'very', 'beginning', 'knew', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'LOST', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'show.It', 'show', 'thinking', 'not', 'sound', 'elitist', 'anything', 'thinking', 'kind', 'lost', 'art', 'pun', 'intended', 'show', 'pay', 'attention', 'look', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'happening', 'forefront', 'also', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'background', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'single', 'viewing', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'episodes', 'have', 'watched', 'noticing', 'little', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'noticed', 'Most', 'tend', 'think', 'just', 'have', 'seen', 'something', 'once', 'know', 'know', 'something', 'false', 'as', 'well', 'dangerous', 'assumption', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'know', 'anything', 'ourselve', 'included.Of', 'course', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'invest', 'time', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'thinking', 'Most', 'people', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'thinking', 'person', 'show', 'also', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'show', 'well', 'season', 'really', 'packed', 'whallop', 'episode.If', 'was', 'anything', 'good', 'came', 'writer', 'strike', 'was', 'season', 'forced', 'writers', 'really', 'cut', 'back', 'excess', 'storylines', 'make', 'episode', 'tight', 'point', 'were', 'couple', 'episodes', 'where', 'just', 'sat', 'long', 'credits', 'rolled', 'up', 'just', 'total', 'amazement', 'how', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'one', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'think', ""'m"", ""'m"", 'just', 'gushing', 'gush', 'think', 'Emerson', 'actor', 'who', 'character', 'Ben', 'such', 'convincing', 'actor', 'level', 'really', 'think', 'character', 'who', 'really', 'Why', 'way', 'What', 'are', 'true', 'intentions', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'think', 'really', 'feel', 'character', 'least', 'do', 'range', 'human', 'emotions', 'being', 'downright', 'evil', 'compassionate', 'concerned', 'living', 'breathing', 'dichotomy', ""'re"", 'honest', 'most', 'are.Someone', 'suggested', 'show', 'ridiculous', 'show', 'anything', 'ridiculous', 'may', 'leave', 'scratching', 'head', 'may', 'have', 'running', 'computer', 'googling', 'name', 'Jeremy', 'Bentham', 'see', 'what', 'possible', 'information', 'can', 'be', 'uncovered', 'discovered', 'particular', 'person', 'never', 'ridiculous.The', 'creators', 'show', 'decided', 'were', 'going', 'tell', 'story', 'sometimes', 'stories', 'have', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'unravel', 'fully', 'completely', 'person', 'who', 'story', 'ultimately', 'rewarded', 'trust', 'creators', 'show', 'firmly', 'believe', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'dream', 'character', 'mind', 'was', 'child', 'snowglobe', 'anything', 'remotely', 'similar', 'think', 'will', 'end', 'started', 'complete', 'mind', 'blower', 'Most', 'television', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'blow', 'minds', 'want', 'viewer', 'feel', 'comfortably', 'numb', 'safe.True', 'safety', 'not', 'known', 'unknown', 'are', 'willing', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'LOST', 'will', 'be', 'ultimately', 'rewarded', 'long', 'run.Peace', 'Blessings', 'losties', 'john', 'Light', 'Coach']",N/A

I agree with the person who says that the writers just make stuff up without taking anything from previous episodes into account. In seasons 1 through 3, the confusing plot was alleviated by the flashbacks; they gave you nice breaks where you could relax and get to know the characters better. Now, they have been replaced by ""flash-forwards"". So now we have to keep track of what's going on on the island, PLUS the stuff in the future, which involves a mysterious conspiracy of some kind (maybe, it's all very vague). Basically, this show has gotten too clever for its own good. They keep packing in more mysteries, more plot twists, and more characters (who in turn have more mysteries and plot twists in their personal stories). It's a shame, because I have always felt that the dialogue and acting on this show was very good. If I got the satisfaction of a loose end tied up even once in a while, I would probably keep watching, but they never explain ANYTHING. What I find most hilarious of all is that at the end of every season, the writers give interviews saying things like ""Oh, the last season was very confusing, but just wait.

A boat and a helicopter are waiting not too far from shore.  This is thrilling news to Jack (Matthew Fox).  Locke (Terry O'Quinn), on the other hand, is convinced they all need to stay on the island.  And so the survivors are split into two camps.But when the ""rescue party"" arrives on the island, they don't seem to know who any of the survivors are and aren't that interested in rescuing them.  Instead, newcomers Daniel (Jeremy Davies), Miles (Ken Leung), and Charlotte (Rebecca Mader) seem to have an agenda of their own.  An agenda that involves Ben (Michael Emerson).  And when Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) make it to the ship, they make a surprising discovery.As if all this weren't enough, we have the character flashback and flash forwards.  It's always obvious which one we are having.  And they always provide the most tantalizing clues.  In this case, the trips forward in time reveal that only six of the castaways make it off the island.  Who are they?  And what happens to the others?Since the producers have now set an end date for the show, things are moving forward with precision.  There are no weak episodes here.  Several episodes answer long held mysteries, in fact.  Of course, other episodes proceed to give us even more mysteries than we had before.  And don't you dare expect anything less than a cliffhanger for the season ender.I can't praise the excellent writing without mentioning the equally great acting.  There is not one weak link on this show.  And with an ensemble this large, that's saying something.  I am drawn into the show every week and can't wait to spend more time with these wonderful characters.Thanks to the writer's strike, there are only 13 episodes this season.

1159906,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B0018CWEYY,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[13, 43]","First, this blu-ray isn't worth the money. The combination of budget cuts and the writers strike reduced season four to only 14 episodes. And yet this blu-ray is priced at the same rate as a 26-episode season. Its ridiculously overpriced considering the limited content available. The company itself seems to have realized the problem in that they padded out the package to five discs when it could have fit on something far smaller.They could have made up for the lack of episodes versus the cost with extras. But they didn't. They didn't even take advantage of the basic features of the blu-ray to do the extras right. The ""flashbacks in order"" content could have been done technically in a much more sophisticated way then how they did it. They could have thrown in maps or uncut music or still photos or photos of props or almost anything. It would have cost little and somewhat made up for the content vs. price problem.As to the show itself, the network made a decision after Season 3 to dramatically cut the budget for the show and its very apparent in Season 4. The sets often look extremely cheap or flat-out ridiculous.In the ridiculous catagory is the set for the trial of ""kate"". The series has established her as a fugitive who murdered her father in Iowa, committed insurance fraud, was involved in a shootout with the police and has numerous crimes to her name. The trial should have been one of the dramatic high-points of the series. But it falls apart. First is is inexplicably set in California. Next they didn't bother to locate reasonable courtroom set. They dressed up what looks like a vacant floor in an office building or a cafiteria as if its court. And the trial itself featured some of the worst writing and plot I can remember on a series that was known for good writing. All those crimes and years of being a fugitive magically go out the window when kate uses another woman's child to emotionaly blackmail her mother. Oh and she is a celebrity too which means they have to drop most of the charges against her. Makes perfect sense.The series also introduces three new major characters who amount to expositional props. We have the ""science"" prop, the ""ghost"" prop and the ""dharma"" prop. They seem obivouisly written into the show as vehicles to allow the writers to explain things that cannot otherwise be explained. The characters have no particular depth or interest to them.Three characters are also written out of the show late the season in a rather useless way. After building them up for three seasons, it was like ""ok now that we have had the tender emotional reunion shot, we don't know what to do with this character anymore so lets off them"".The whiny/weak michael character comes back after a seasons absence and spends a few episodes whining before they get rid of him again.They also got so low on ideas this season that they dragged out the old saw of the ""medical emergency"" in the jungle complete with long drawn-out surgery and excessive angest.The flashforwards didn't pan out for the show either. The problem was that they didn't focus on the characters getting on with their lives in the real world or having changed from being on the Island. All the humanity of the characters was thrown away in favor of a shocking future plot twist per episode. It got old real fast.And how does the season end? It ended with one of those specially written cliffhanger endings to deal with a cast member whose contract is up and entering a renegotiation phase.In summary, the blu-ray edition is overpriced and the season itself suffered from bad writing and serious budget cuts. The writing had created an expansive plot world of well-designed characters for three seasons. But the fourth season seemed to be about reductions and cutting things off moving toward an ending. Its hard to say where they show goes from here. But what I can say is that companies like ABC/Disney are going to poison the market for blu-rays if they keep producing overpriced editions with as little content as this one.",1,overpriced blu-ray and a diminished quality season,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,4035,"['First', 'blu-ray', ""n't"", 'worth', 'money', 'combination', 'budget', 'cuts', 'writers', 'strike', 'reduced', 'season', 'four', 'only', '14', 'episodes', 'yet', 'blu-ray', 'priced', 'same', 'rate', '26-episode', 'season', 'ridiculously', 'overpriced', 'considering', 'limited', 'content', 'available', 'company', 'have', 'realized', 'problem', 'padded', 'out', 'package', 'five', 'discs', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'fit', 'something', 'far', 'smaller.They', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'lack', 'episodes', 'cost', 'extras', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'advantage', 'basic', 'features', 'blu-ray', 'do', 'extras', 'right', 'flashbacks', 'order', 'content', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'technically', 'much', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'way', 'then', 'how', 'did', 'could', 'have', 'thrown', 'maps', 'uncut', 'music', 'still', 'photos', 'photos', 'props', 'almost', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 'cost', 'little', 'somewhat', 'made', 'up', 'content', 'vs.', 'price', 'problem.As', 'show', 'network', 'made', 'decision', 'Season', '3', 'dramatically', 'cut', 'budget', 'show', 'very', 'apparent', 'Season', '4', 'sets', 'often', 'look', 'extremely', 'cheap', 'flat-out', 'ridiculous.In', 'ridiculous', 'catagory', 'set', 'trial', 'kate', 'series', 'established', 'fugitive', 'who', 'murdered', 'father', 'Iowa', 'committed', 'insurance', 'fraud', 'was', 'involved', 'shootout', 'police', 'numerous', 'crimes', 'name', 'trial', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'dramatic', 'high-points', 'series', 'apart', 'First', 'inexplicably', 'set', 'California', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'locate', 'reasonable', 'courtroom', 'set', 'dressed', 'up', 'what', 'vacant', 'floor', 'office', 'building', 'cafiteria', 'court', 'trial', 'featured', 'worst', 'writing', 'plot', 'can', 'remember', 'series', 'was', 'known', 'good', 'writing', 'crimes', 'years', 'being', 'fugitive', 'magically', 'go', 'out', 'window', 'when', 'kate', 'woman', 'child', 'emotionaly', 'blackmail', 'mother', 'Oh', 'celebrity', 'too', 'have', 'drop', 'most', 'charges', 'Makes', 'perfect', 'sense.The', 'series', 'also', 'three', 'new', 'major', 'characters', 'who', 'amount', 'expositional', 'props', 'have', 'science', 'prop', 'ghost', 'prop', 'dharma', 'prop', 'seem', 'obivouisly', 'written', 'show', 'vehicles', 'allow', 'writers', 'explain', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'otherwise', 'be', 'explained', 'characters', 'have', 'particular', 'depth', 'interest', 'them.Three', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'written', 'show', 'late', 'season', 'rather', 'useless', 'way', 'building', 'up', 'three', 'seasons', 'was', 'ok', 'now', 'have', 'had', 'tender', 'emotional', 'reunion', 'shot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'character', 'anymore', 'so', 'off', 'whiny/weak', 'michael', 'character', 'back', 'seasons', 'absence', 'few', 'episodes', 'whining', 'get', 'rid', 'again.They', 'also', 'got', 'so', 'low', 'ideas', 'season', 'dragged', 'out', 'old', 'saw', 'medical', 'emergency', 'jungle', 'complete', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'surgery', 'excessive', 'angest.The', 'flashforwards', 'did', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'show', 'either', 'problem', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'characters', 'getting', 'lives', 'real', 'world', 'having', 'changed', 'being', 'Island', 'humanity', 'characters', 'was', 'thrown', 'away', 'favor', 'shocking', 'future', 'plot', 'twist', 'episode', 'got', 'old', 'real', 'fast.And', 'how', 'season', 'end', 'ended', 'one', 'specially', 'written', 'cliffhanger', 'endings', 'deal', 'cast', 'member', 'contract', 'up', 'entering', 'renegotiation', 'phase.In', 'summary', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'overpriced', 'season', 'suffered', 'bad', 'writing', 'serious', 'budget', 'cuts', 'writing', 'had', 'created', 'expansive', 'plot', 'world', 'well-designed', 'characters', 'three', 'seasons', 'fourth', 'season', 'seemed', 'be', 'reductions', 'cutting', 'things', 'moving', 'ending', 'hard', 'say', 'where', 'show', 'here', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'companies', 'ABC/Disney', 'are', 'going', 'poison', 'market', 'blu-rays', 'keep', 'producing', 'overpriced', 'editions', 'as', 'little', 'content', 'one']",N/A

Sure, there were plenty of good episodes, but there too many filler episodes, and things seemed to be moving in a direction of aimlessness.

The story was rather well done, as the story involved the characters off the island, and how they got off the island in the first place, ending almost at the same time as season 3 ended.  Mysteries were answered, while some new ones were added, but the important thing was that it was well written, acted, and incredibly entertaining the entire time.  I highly recommend it as a fan of lost, and a fan of excellent television in general.",5,A return to form,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,721,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'lost', 'season', '3', 'Sure', 'were', 'plenty', 'good', 'episodes', 'there', 'too', 'many', 'filler', 'episodes', 'things', 'seemed', 'be', 'moving', 'direction', 'aimlessness', 'Luckily', 'Season', '4', 'returned', 'greatness', 'was', 'arguably', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'story', 'was', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'story', 'involved', 'characters', 'island', 'how', 'got', 'off', 'island', 'first', 'place', 'ending', 'almost', 'same', 'time', 'season', '3', 'ended', 'Mysteries', 'were', 'answered', 'new', 'ones', 'were', 'added', 'important', 'thing', 'was', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'entire', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fan', 'lost', 'fan', 'excellent', 'television', 'general']",N/A
1159912,A16XRPF40679KG,B0018CWEYY,Michael Dobey,"[1, 1]","This continues the excellent enigmatic series of Lost and it's on blu ray.The picture is fantastic and it's as good as the previous season 3 on blu ray.  It is only 14 episodes though. However for some reason the people in charge have decided to make the next two seasons only 17 episodes each. This one was only planned for 16 episodes which is short for a modern american series.  The price is high , just like bbc's excellent 'torchwood"" on blu ray which is only 13 episodes long.  In truth the whole blu ray market needs to drop in price , when that happens we will see a flood of new blu ray buyers.  This series is great but due to it's shorter length the violence and destruction comes at a faster rate.  This is what happens when you shorten a series.  Characters start dying off left and right and you get less of a back story. I think the decision to shorten the next two seasons is a mistake , which leads to a more action packed show but it's less character driven and we don't get to know the newer characters much.  Still this is LOST , a totally inventive show that is engaging and extremely well written.  On blu ray it's brilliant to watch and the totally excellent acting of everyone involved is heads above most television series.  One thing that did shock me though was the ending in which a character returns( off camera) to the mainland to confront the survivors who escaped the Island and tells them 'bad things"" happened after they left.  When in reality ever since they crashed on the island it was one death and disaster after another.As good as this season was it was very fast moving and it removed many people from the island. Although on the island death is never the real end of the story.  A longer series length would mean more characterization between the carnage; but sadly they are not going that route for season 5 and 6.  It's worth buying this and season 3 on blu ray instead of watching them on standard dvd.  Let's hope they eventually put out season one and two on blu ray  as well.  Lost is a masterpiece of television series making and blu ray really makes this show stand out.",5,from now on expect shorter seasons.,1229731200,"12 20, 2008",2008,2121,"['excellent', 'enigmatic', 'series', 'Lost', 'blu', 'ray.The', 'picture', 'fantastic', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'season', '3', 'blu', 'ray', 'only', '14', 'episodes', 'However', 'reason', 'people', 'charge', 'have', 'decided', 'make', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'only', '17', 'episodes', 'one', 'was', 'only', 'planned', '16', 'episodes', 'short', 'modern', 'american', 'series', 'price', 'high', 'just', 'bbc', 'excellent', ""'torchwood"", 'blu', 'ray', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'long', 'truth', 'whole', 'blu', 'ray', 'market', 'drop', 'price', 'when', 'will', 'see', 'flood', 'new', 'blu', 'ray', 'buyers', 'series', 'great', 'due', 'shorter', 'length', 'violence', 'destruction', 'faster', 'rate', 'what', 'when', 'shorten', 'series', 'Characters', 'start', 'dying', 'off', 'left', 'right', 'get', 'less', 'back', 'story', 'think', 'decision', 'shorten', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'mistake', 'more', 'action', 'packed', 'show', 'less', 'character', 'driven', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'newer', 'characters', 'much', 'Still', 'LOST', 'totally', 'inventive', 'show', 'engaging', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'blu', 'ray', 'brilliant', 'watch', 'totally', 'excellent', 'acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'heads', 'most', 'television', 'series', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'shock', 'was', 'ending', 'character', 'returns', 'camera', 'mainland', 'confront', 'survivors', 'who', 'escaped', 'Island', 'things', 'happened', 'left', 'When', 'reality', 'ever', 'crashed', 'island', 'was', 'one', 'death', 'disaster', 'another.As', 'good', 'season', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'fast', 'moving', 'removed', 'many', 'people', 'island', 'island', 'death', 'never', 'real', 'end', 'story', 'A', 'longer', 'series', 'length', 'would', 'mean', 'more', 'characterization', 'carnage', 'sadly', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'route', 'season', '5', '6', 'worth', 'buying', 'season', '3', 'blu', 'ray', 'instead', 'watching', 'standard', 'dvd', 'Let', 'hope', 'eventually', 'put', 'out', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'blu', 'ray', 'as', 'well', 'Lost', 'masterpiece', 'television', 'series', 'making', 'blu', 'ray', 'really', 'show', 'out']",N/A
1159913,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0018CWEYY,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","Be forewarned, there are some spoilers from season 4 and the prior seasons in this review.  The season 4 spoilers are kept to a minimum but if you have not seen prior seasons proceed with caution.Season 4 of lost was shortened by the writers strike so there are 14 episodes instead of the usual 22-24.  This season puts the focus back on the ""main"" castaways instead that was lost somewhat in season 3 because of the heavy focus on The Others.  While that storyline still exists and we learn more about the island and who wants to find it, a lot of the fate of the main characters is revealed.This season picks up where last season kicked off.  Most of the flashes in this season are flash forwards, revealing the fate of the 6 characters who make it off the island.  In the season finale we find out exactly how they made it off.  Jack finds out about his sister and we discover that revelation sent him into the tail spin that took him to where the flash forward at the very end of season 3 showed him to be.  However the flashes in the beginning of the season basically progress up to that point so we see how he and the other Oceanic Six try to reintegrate into society.  We also learn more about Ben's motives as the season goes along.  As with prior seasons there are people that get killed off, but that does not mean you see the last of them.As far as the discs go.  The A/V quality is great.  There are a ton of bonus features, that total well over 2 hrs.  The best being a ""documentary"" about the Oceanic Six conspiracy.  There are also deleted and extended scenes, commentary, and a great featurette that uses scenes we did not see (whether they were deleted scenes or things that were filmed later) to fill in the gaps of things that actually aired.  So for those who like all the extras there is definitely enough there to keep you happy.  They also went back to the version of season play that told you the episode you left off in and how far into it you were.  And at the end of each disc it had the find out what happens next pop ups.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[46, 57]","Lost has had its up's and down's, particularly during a sub-par second season and a drawn out third season, but after the jaw-dropping ending of the third season, Lost is back on top.  For those that haven't seen some of the episodes featured in the fourth season of Lost, be warned that some spoilers are ahead here.  With rescue seeming to be in sight, things get even more complicated as a group of strangers (Jeremy Davies, Ken Leung, Rebecca Mader, and Jeff Fahey) make their way to the island, and they're not all there to save anyone.  Adding to the problem is the freighter boat out at sea which Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) arrive to, where they get a big surprise (which wasn't a big surprise to viewers of the show) as Michael (Harold Perrineau) returns, and he's working for Ben (Michael Emerson).  With Ben and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) warning Jack (Matthew Fox) that they can't leave the island, everything comes to an explosive season-ending climax involving a murderous commando (Kevin Durand), more light ends up getting shed on Lost's mythology as well.  Now mixing both flashbacks and flash-forwards, we learn that at least six of the Oceanic survivors make it off the island: Jack, Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Hurley (Jorge Garcia), Sayid, Sun (Yunjiin Kim), Claire's (Emilie de Ravin) baby Aaron, and naturally, Ben.  The season-ending shocker promises that things are only going to develop further, as there are only two seasons of the show left to go.  Even though more characters were introduced (and at times it felt as if more time was focused on Sayid and Desmond's time on the ship than necessary), the way that Lost managed to juggle all these characters this season is something extraordinary.  And while favorites like Jack and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) felt as if they took a step back, both have some great moments here as well.  Most importantly however is that this season of the show firmly re-establishes the series as a spectacular mystery-thriller that will have you drooling to see what happens next.  Even though the show briefly came to a stop thanks to the writer's strike, Lost never missed a beat this season.  Needless to say, if you gave up on Lost in the past, now has never been a better time to get re-acquainted with the series, as things seem to promise to only get better from this point forward.  As corny as it may sound, getting Lost has never been so enjoyable.",5,Back on top,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,2434,"['Lost', 'had', 'up', 'down', 'particularly', 'sub-par', 'second', 'season', 'drawn', 'third', 'season', 'jaw-dropping', 'ending', 'third', 'season', 'Lost', 'back', 'top', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'featured', 'fourth', 'season', 'Lost', 'be', 'warned', 'spoilers', 'are', 'ahead', 'here', 'rescue', 'seeming', 'be', 'sight', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'group', 'strangers', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Ken', 'Leung', 'Rebecca', 'Mader', 'Jeff', 'Fahey', 'make', 'way', 'island', ""'re"", 'not', 'all', 'there', 'save', 'anyone', 'Adding', 'problem', 'freighter', 'boat', 'out', 'sea', 'Sayid', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'Desmond', 'Henry', 'Ian', 'Cusick', 'arrive', 'where', 'get', 'big', 'surprise', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'surprise', 'viewers', 'show', 'Michael', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'returns', 'working', 'Ben', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'Ben', 'Locke', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'warning', 'Jack', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'island', 'everything', 'explosive', 'season-ending', 'climax', 'involving', 'murderous', 'commando', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'more', 'light', 'up', 'getting', 'shed', 'Lost', 'mythology', 'as', 'well', 'Now', 'mixing', 'flashbacks', 'flash-forwards', 'learn', 'least', 'six', 'Oceanic', 'survivors', 'make', 'off', 'island', 'Jack', 'Kate', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'Hurley', 'Jorge', 'Garcia', 'Sayid', 'Sun', 'Yunjiin', 'Kim', 'Claire', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'baby', 'Aaron', 'naturally', 'Ben', 'season-ending', 'shocker', 'things', 'are', 'only', 'going', 'develop', 'further', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'left', 'go', 'Even', 'more', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'times', 'felt', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'focused', 'Sayid', 'Desmond', 'time', 'ship', 'necessary', 'way', 'Lost', 'managed', 'juggle', 'characters', 'season', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'favorites', 'Jack', 'Sawyer', 'Josh', 'Holloway', 'felt', 'took', 'step', 'back', 'have', 'great', 'moments', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Most', 'importantly', 'however', 'season', 'show', 'firmly', 'series', 'spectacular', 'mystery-thriller', 'will', 'have', 'drooling', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'Even', 'show', 'briefly', 'came', 'stop', 'thanks', 'writer', 'strike', 'Lost', 'never', 'missed', 'beat', 'season', 'Needless', 'say', 'gave', 'up', 'Lost', 'past', 'now', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'time', 'get', 're-acquainted', 'series', 'things', 'seem', 'promise', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'point', 'forward', 'As', 'corny', 'may', 'sound', 'getting', 'Lost', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'enjoyable']",N/A

Lost is something to look forward to. It really has become a part of our lives.In many ways the best way to enjoy Lost is to avoid learning anything about it and just watch it with others who know nothing about it and guess what is going on. For this reason just buy it and prepare to watch a whole season in the span of a few days and then sulk in disappointed over how you have to wait another year to watch the next season, skipping TV, because you know watching a season with every episode back to back is the best way to experience the best that television has to offer.The logistics are simple. A plane travelling from Sydney to LA has veered 1000km off course and smashed into an island strewing the passengers everywhere who soon learn from a co-pilot that their rescuers are looking for them in the wrong place. When the co-pilot is hurled into the air and eaten alive by an invisible beast who stalks the island the audience comes to realize that the island is no ordinary island, and so do the survivors who set about establishing themselves and facing various challenges that befall them.What do the people on the ship want? Why is there a time delay? What does the island want? What is the `Dharma initiative'? Why are there alternative dimensions? What strange connection does Locke have with the island? Who is Jacob? Is this all an experiment? What is it about the cabin? These are the kind of questions that can come up in a single episode of Lost... however the catch is that you have to wait quite awhile for anything to get answered and the good news is that Lost Season 4, goes further than any of other seasons in answering questions and even appears to have resolutions for some of the characters. It has lots of surprises in store.Season 1 was about the island. Season 2 was about the hatch. Season 3 was about `the others'. Season 4 is about escaping the island.Season 4 is essentially one big get away from island with lots of action and lots of mayhem. It may even be the weirdest most mystical season yet with lots in the way of oddness, some of it revealed for what it is. While a whole new set of characters are introduced a lot are killed in this season and there are hardly any flashbacks but lots of flash forwards. Many of the characters even switch places and the difference between good and bad begins blurs a lot. It is welcoming to see the background stories and character build-ups reduced to this level. It is very progressive now and all forward, direct and more confident.The main questions are still there though. Who do you side with and why? Who do you hope makes it and who do you secretly hope doesn't? Who makes it off the island and who doesn't? Characters we even thought where gone may even show up again.  While the writers of this show are layering thick on the drama to near melting point they really upped the ante on the action and fight sequences.The ethnic variations of actors and actresses gives Lost a worldwide appeal, and deservingly so, as who can say that they don't enjoy the suspense and mystery it has to offer. Lost 4 is simply one of the best seasons yet. It is a little different from previous seasons because it accelerates very quickly and the tension surpasses maybe all the other season put together.

1159924,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B0018CWEYY,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[6, 6]","The Writer's Strike of 2007-2008 really impacted a lot of shows.  ""Lost,"" which was intended to have sixteen episodes this season, was shortened to fourteen (three of those episodes just being different parts of the season finale).  I was going to start this review off in a bold way, saying that the shortness of the season actually helped ""Lost"" as opposed to hurt it, but I'm going to rephrase that.  I don't know if it HELPED, because I want as much ""Lost"" as I can possibly get, but the shortness of this season definitely didn't HURT ""Lost"" as much as it did other shows.  Let me explain.The fourth season of ""Lost"" doesn't feel stunted.  It feels like a long movie divided up into parts.  While previous seasons did revolve around plots that were specific to that season (one being the initial intrigue of the island, two being the hatch, three being the Others), this season takes it to the next level, offering up the most standalone seasonal arc in ""Lost"" history.  Each and every episode this season deals with the freighter and the question if the people on it have come to rescue the castaways or not.  Every conflict and plotline this season stems from this.  The castaways are split into two groups, with Jack and Locke as respective leaders, which elevates the rift between the two of them to violent new levels.  The flash-forward that happened in the finale ofSeason Threeis finally given context, linking up with the story of the freighter.  The shortness of this season also makes that plot, dubbed the ""Oceanic Six"" storyline, a lot stronger, as it is able to detail who got off, how they got off, and also create the new plot thread of what is going on with those characters that got off the island.With the finale of Season Three, ""Lost"" showed us that things were about to change in a big way.  Including a flash-forward really shook up the nature of the show, and those who think they had ""Lost"" structurally figured out will be given a rude awakening this season.  There are flash-backs, flash-forwards, flash-forwards alongside of flash-backs, and there might even be some time travel.  The sheer brashness of the fact that the creative team of ""Lost"" is so interested in engaging viewers in an interactive experience that they're willing to tamper with the structure of the show so much is really refreshing.  Overall, it's challenging to follow, but no more challenging than a really fun puzzle.  The more impatient viewers will fault this season for being ""too confusing,"" but I highly, highly disagree.  Season Four of ""Lost"" is the most straight forward of all the seasons.  You just have to pay attention.  Because in ""Lost,"" which continues to be the best show currently airing on television, everything matters.9/10",5,"A Shorter, Tighter Season",1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,2750,"['Writer', 'Strike', '2007-2008', 'really', 'impacted', 'lot', 'shows', 'Lost', 'was', 'intended', 'have', 'sixteen', 'episodes', 'season', 'was', 'shortened', 'fourteen', 'three', 'episodes', 'just', 'being', 'different', 'parts', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'going', 'start', 'review', 'off', 'bold', 'way', 'saying', 'shortness', 'season', 'actually', 'helped', 'Lost', 'opposed', 'hurt', ""'m"", 'going', 'rephrase', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'HELPED', 'want', 'much', 'Lost', 'can', 'possibly', 'get', 'shortness', 'season', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'HURT', 'Lost', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'other', 'shows', 'Let', 'explain.The', 'fourth', 'season', 'Lost', ""n't"", 'feel', 'stunted', 'long', 'movie', 'divided', 'up', 'parts', 'previous', 'seasons', 'did', 'revolve', 'plots', 'were', 'specific', 'season', 'one', 'being', 'initial', 'intrigue', 'island', 'two', 'being', 'hatch', 'three', 'being', 'Others', 'season', 'next', 'level', 'offering', 'up', 'most', 'standalone', 'seasonal', 'arc', 'Lost', 'history', 'episode', 'season', 'freighter', 'question', 'people', 'have', 'come', 'rescue', 'castaways', 'not', 'Every', 'conflict', 'plotline', 'season', 'castaways', 'are', 'split', 'two', 'groups', 'Jack', 'Locke', 'respective', 'leaders', 'rift', 'two', 'violent', 'new', 'levels', 'flash-forward', 'happened', 'finale', 'ofSeason', 'Threeis', 'finally', 'given', 'context', 'linking', 'up', 'story', 'freighter', 'shortness', 'season', 'also', 'plot', 'dubbed', 'Oceanic', 'Six', 'storyline', 'lot', 'stronger', 'able', 'detail', 'who', 'got', 'off', 'how', 'got', 'off', 'also', 'create', 'new', 'plot', 'thread', 'what', 'going', 'characters', 'got', 'island.With', 'finale', 'Season', 'Three', 'Lost', 'showed', 'things', 'were', 'change', 'big', 'way', 'Including', 'flash-forward', 'really', 'shook', 'up', 'nature', 'show', 'who', 'think', 'had', 'Lost', 'structurally', 'figured', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'rude', 'awakening', 'season', 'are', 'flash-backs', 'flash-forwards', 'flash-forwards', 'flash-backs', 'there', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'time', 'travel', 'sheer', 'brashness', 'fact', 'creative', 'team', 'Lost', 'so', 'interested', 'engaging', 'viewers', 'interactive', 'experience', ""'re"", 'willing', 'tamper', 'structure', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'refreshing', 'Overall', 'challenging', 'follow', 'more', 'challenging', 'really', 'fun', 'puzzle', 'more', 'impatient', 'viewers', 'will', 'fault', 'season', 'being', 'too', 'confusing', 'highly', 'highly', 'disagree', 'Season', 'Four', 'Lost', 'most', 'straight', 'forward', 'seasons', 'just', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'Lost', 'be', 'best', 'show', 'currently', 'airing', 'television', 'everything', 'matters.9/10']",N/A

In fact, I thought season 3 was pretty good, so I don't really understand all the trumpeting of 'the return of Lost,' but I will agree that season 4 is one of the leanest, most gripping seasons of the show's run. Every episode is filled to the brim with great acting, twists and turns, and every episode moves the plot along nicely, which I have to admit wasn't always the case in season 3.The extras in this package are, typically for Lost, a nicely rounded bunch. The commentaries are good for the most part, and the other extras are great. I loved the featurette on the music of Lost because it is one of my favorite things about the show. It was supremely interesting to see all of the offbeat 'instruments' that they use to achieve the unique auditory signature of the show.Overall, if you're a fan of Lost, you're going to pick this up whether I recommend it or not.

1159929,A2PPTN3DTD8QNW,B0018CWEYY,Rich Grace,"[0, 0]","Lost makes a big comeback in this abbreviated 4th season. In fact, the story line seems to have benefitted by having only thirteen episodes to tell it. Where the preceding season seemed to meander a bit and sometimes lose its narrative focus, here many of the dangling threads from Season 3 are gracefully resolved and the expansion of the settings from the island to the offshore freighter produce a consistently strong series of episodes.Don't miss ""The Constant,"" in which the Desmond Hume character assumes center stage and the actor playing him gives an Emmy-worthy performance. From there on the narrative gathers momentum and does something virtually impossible: make Linus a sympathetic character. The season finale episodes ""There's No Place Like Home (Pt. 1 & 2),"" are a match for anything the cast and crew have ever done on this series. Part 2 in particular is riveting. In fact, it's one of the best things I have ever seen on television, period. An awful lot of story lines get resolved in eighty minutes, yet every primary character in that episode takes on almost mythic dimensions. The finale is cinematic in its sweep and its eventfulness, in the best possible way.I have to single out Michael Emerson as a tremendous actor, who never chews the scenery but effortlessly commands the screen, along with some of the supporting actors, such as Jeremy Davies (Faraday), Jeff Fahey (Lepidus, the copter pilot) and the superb Kevin Durand (Keamy), who add complexity and depth to the story line and are all sensational. But Season 4 really begins and ends with Ian Cusick (Desmond), whose devastating phone call in ""The Constant"" and his emotional reunion in the finale provide the emotional arc of the season and point the way forward to Season 5.This is some of the best television going. The BluRay version is also sensational in quality. The whole thing is not to be missed.

1159931,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0018CWEYY,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","I'm not sure why I didn't write a review of LOST Season 4 earlier, but better late than never.  I did finish rewatching Season 4 (this time on Blu-ray) shortly before the beginning of Season 4.  Let me just add that watching it on Blu-ray brought a whole new level of appreciation for it.  It was so good that I plan on buying the rest of the series - even the earlier seasons - on Blu-ray as they become available (at the moment I think only Season 3 is also available).  Though it is a tad disconcerting seeing every bit of Locke's stubble and every hair at the top of Jeff Fahey's chest.I have been surprised in talking with people how many of them - not viewers of the show - are laboring under the impression that LOST started off great but then got bad and has stayed bad.  Not true!  LOST started off great, then stayed good in Season 2, though it had a tendency to lose focus of the overarching story.  Then it got very bad at the beginning of Season 3 before correcting course, tightening up the narrative pace, and then got in Season 4 as good as it has ever been.  And for the record, so far in Season 5 it appears in little danger of losing its way again.  What happened, I believe, is that when LOST became a megahit in Season 1, ABC encouraged the two boss men of LOST, Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse, to slow the story down so as to be able to stretch the show out over 7 or 8 seasons.  But after the intense fan anger over the first six - and very uninspiring - they decided to stop dawdling and start giving the fans more answers than mysteries.  After Season 3 Lindelhof and Cuse announced that there would be only three more seasons, each of them 16 episodes in length, and all of them shown without any weeks off between episodes.  This schedule was upset somewhat by the writers' strike.  As a result, Season 4 was somewhat shorter than they intended, something that will be made up by expanding Seasons 5 and 6 by an episode each.If Season 1 of LOST was about the island, Season 2 about the hatch, and Season 3 about the Others, then Season 4 was about the boat that appeared at the end of Season 3.  Something that is easy to miss is what a brief period of time Season 4 encompasses.  From the moment that the boat appears until the island is ""moved,"" only a week or so occurs.  The final episode's final minutes then allow several days on Penny's boat before the Oceanic Six show up in civilization again.After the shocking end of Season 3, the narrative of LOST altered significantly.  The first three seasons, with the lone exception of Desmond, focused on flashbacks in the lives of the various inhabitants on the island.  But after the flash forward that ended Season 3, most of the narratives of the various individuals consisted of flash forwards, the major exception being, once again, Desmond.  His episode, perhaps the finest episode of the season, ""The Constant,"" showed him, like Billy Pilgrim, becoming unstuck in time.  [The flash-forward that ended Season 3 occasioned, by the way, a bit of controversy.  After BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's Season Two ended with a flash forward, Damon Lindelhof was asked explicitly in a Q&A; if LOST would ever do that.  He said that they would not, even though he already knew that they intended to do precisely that.  Some fans were upset that he lied to them.  But hey!  What was he supposed to do, say that they were going to flash forward in the season finale?  Where would have been the fun in that?]Season 4 saw the introduction of several new characters.  The four most significant were the ones who came to the island on a helicopter from the boat.  Daniel Faraday (played marvelously by Jeremy Davies) is a physicist who knows a surprising amount about time travel.  Charlotte Lewis [LOST has a stunning number of characters - both major and minor - named after prominent British intellectuals; Charlotte is named quite explicitly after C. S. Lewis, her full name being Charlotte Staples Lewis and his Clive Staples Lewis, but as in most of the other instances, there does not seem to be any discernible correlation between the character's name and the person for whom she is named] is another scientist who obviously cares for Daniel.  Ken Leung plays Miles, a clearly untrustworthy soul who possesses an unusual link with the dead.  Finally, Jeff Fahey plays Frank Lapidus, a helicopter pilot who seems to be one of the good guys.  Back on the boat, the bad guys are headed by the villainous Martin Keamy, played by Kevin Durand (interestingly, perhaps best known for a role on DARK ANGEL for which he is almost impossible to recognize:  he played Joshua aka Dog Boy, Max Guevera's ""Big Brother,"" on Season Two, a role that required major prostheses).The season introduced many new questions while answering many others.  For instance, in the time traveling episode in which Desmond keeps getting taken back in time, Daniel explains that to break the cycle he needs a ""constant,"" which in his case turns out to be Penny.  This leads to perhaps the best scene of the season - heck, one of the greatest scenes in the whole series - as Desmond, moving back and forth in time, frantically tells Penny to answer his phone call on Christmas Eve, 2004.  When she answered the phone and they profess their love to one another, I was simply overcome with emotion.  The mystery occurs a few minutes later, when Daniel is seen back on the island, his notebook in hand.  Opening it to a passage he wrote many years earlier, we read over his shoulder the words, ""If anything goes wrong, Desmond Hume is my constant.""  Say huh?All in all, this was a spectacular season.  One only hopes that the ending will be as good as the individual seasons have been.  Like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, the eventual judgment on the show will be whether the story as a whole stands up.  These two shows are unique in that the entire series will end up telling a single story (much the same was true of BABYLON 5, though network interference caused what was supposed to be a five-season story get wrapped up at the end of Season 4, only to have the show unexpectedly renewed for a fifth season, by which time it was too late to adhere to the original plan).  Now, I think LOST, like BSG, will be a good series even if the ending is disappointing.  But like BSG, if the ending isn't strong, then it will undercut the previous six seasons (BSG still has seven final episodes as I write this, but so far it looks like it is going to end spectacularly well).  If it ends well, I think LOST is going to go down as one of the best series in the history of TV, just as I think BATTLESTAR GALACTICA will.  Unfortunately, I think these two magnificent shows will end up exceptions and not the rule.  Networks hate long, sustained narratives.  They love standalone episodes.  BSG and LOST are both complex serial dramas, while the networks was series to be as episodic as possible.  That makes it easier for potential viewers who have not seen prior episodes to jump in at any point.  But for viewers there is absolutely no question about the superiority of the serial format.  LOST and BSG provide viewing experiences that not only make them superior to other TV shows, but to any movies that one can see.  I hope that we will see more long narratives like these two shows.  But if we don't, that will show just how very, very special they both are.",5,Another splendid season of one of TV's all time most adventurous series,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,7384,"[""'m"", 'not',

1159933,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B0018CWEYY,Roger J. Buffington,"[0, 0]","Lost Season Four is shorter than the first three seasons due to the Writer's Strike, but it packs a lot of developments into its truncated season.  The show is notable for its dazzlingly effective use of flashbacks.  In Season Four it begins using flash-forwards to give us some notion as to if and how some of the survivors get off of the Island.  Consistent with Season Three, Jack is having more than his share of issues and problems which do seem to derive back to his failed marriage, but maybe not.  This part of the storyline seems wrong to me; Jack mostly has it together and that is who he is.  But not here.  This is not really a spoiler because this is obvious very early on in Season Four and even parts of Season Three.  I also would have liked to have seen more development of Elizabeth Mitchell's Dr. Juliet Burke character.  Good chemistry between her and Jack could have been used more, and more effectively.  These are just opinions and they are fun to write about but no matter.  This is a great season of a great miniseries.Let's face it.

1159935,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0018CWEYY,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 9]","If it's May (or afterward) then it means you've missed another great season of Lost, maybe the penultimate of seasons.  One more (likely disappointing and unfathomable, but still impossible to miss) season is in the offing, and this is your last chance to get up to speed.LOST follows the hapless survivors of Oceanic 815, a flight that crashes on an enigmatic pacific island both exotic and menacing.  On this island, the sick and dying become healthy, the weak become strong, time and space lose their linear meanings and the line between the living and the dead blurs.  The survivors, dwindling in number, must contend both with a mysterious monster apparently made of smoke, and the island's existing residents, an implacable and ruthless band known as the others.LAST YEAR ON LOST:Rescue appears at hand - a boat, presumably sent by Penny, Desmond Hume's lover, has found the island.  As the Others melt into the island Ben Linus, their leader (AKA, Fake Henry Gale) foolishly approaches Jack Schepard, begging him not to trust their would-be rescuers.  Surprisingly, John Locke - previously left for dead by Linus - appears to echo his would be killer.  And then the story flash-forwards (a first in a series based on flash-backs) and we see Jack back to the real-world (so to speak).  Jack is consumed by an addiction to pain killers and a compulsion to return to the island which is somehow unreachable.  Salvation hasn't been kind to Jack who is now a wreck.  Now that we know that somebody was rescued, the only question is who survived? What happened?  The stage is set for the tragic circumstances of the rescue of Oceanic 815.TONIGHT ON LOSTIt only covers a few days, but flashbacks (forwards) make it feel like 14 weeks have gone by.  Several rescuers appear on the island, though it's unclear as to whether they mean the Lost of 815 any good.  Jack and John have already split the survivors into two camps, but civil war is averted when armed guerrillas appear on the island to capture Ben and splatter anybody who gets in their way (or anybody else for that matter).  Ben has a few tricks up his sleeve, one of which involves a spy on the ""rescue"" shipIn the future, we see that Hurley is unhinged again, while Sayyid has enlisted as some sort of spy working for...well, why spoil that?  Kate has her day in court, or does she?  Jack is back to looking like his jovial self, though we'll see the growing demons that will turn him into messed up Jack seen at the end of last season.  We get a great episode for Hume in which his life suddenly comes to resemble a LOST script - and he finds himself being tossed back and forth through time.  Expanded character studies of Ben Linus make him a formidable character (and just more formidable in general).  We also see greater roles for the powerful Mr. Widmore and vulnerable Juliet Burke.What didn't work:  This was a shorter season than usual (writer's strike?) and boy will you feel it, so we don't get the same great arcs and plot lines of past seasons.  Also, while we get to see our favorite characters, we don't get as much bout their dual nature as in the past (Juliet gets a lot of time, then disappears - it's clear that some of the LOST still don't trust her, but we've lost reason to doubt her).  The show almost completely passes up a chance to expand on its newcomers - the mercenaries and the scientists.  The flash-forwards seem nifty, but they don't have the finely-tuned structure of the old flashbacks - that is we don't see them elegantly stack together in chronological terms.  Unwittingly, the show proves this when surreptitiously entwining a flash-forward around a flash-back - it's a great device, but it suggests that causation ain't what it used to be (or will be, or...).What you can't miss:  LOST manages to survive despite flirting with disaster in almost every episode, straddling lines of science-fiction and the supernatural without ever becoming a sci-fi or fantasy show.  More than any other show, LOST manages to have its characters swap ends in terms of being sympathetic - with Jack morphing from heroic to self-righteous and power-hungry, while bad-guy Sawyer becomes a real hero.  Abbreviated plot lines nevertheless set the right degree of tension, keeping us glued until that final shocking scene called ""wait till next season!""ABSOLUTELY NO EXTRAS OR FEATURETTES WERE HARMED OR VIEWED IN THE MAKING OF THIS REVIEW.",4,Another Season you can't miss,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,4419,"['May', 'afterward', 'then', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'great', 'season', 'Lost', 'maybe', 'penultimate', 'seasons', 'One', 'more', 'likely', 'disappointing', 'unfathomable', 'still', 'impossible', 'miss', 'season', 'offing', 'last', 'chance', 'get', 'up', 'speed.LOST', 'hapless', 'survivors', 'Oceanic', '815', 'flight', 'enigmatic', 'pacific', 'island', 'exotic', 'menacing', 'island', 'sick', 'dying', 'become', 'healthy', 'weak', 'become', 'strong', 'time', 'space', 'lose', 'linear', 'meanings', 'line', 'living', 'dead', 'blurs', 'survivors', 'dwindling', 'number', 'must', 'contend', 'mysterious', 'monster', 'apparently', 'made', 'smoke', 'island', 'existing', 'residents', 'implacable', 'ruthless', 'band', 'known', 'others.LAST', 'YEAR', 'ON', 'LOST', 'Rescue', 'hand', 'boat', 'presumably', 'sent', 'Penny', 'Desmond', 'Hume', 'lover', 'found', 'island', 'Others', 'melt', 'island', 'Ben', 'Linus', 'leader', 'AKA', 'Fake', 'Henry', 'Gale', 'foolishly', 'Jack', 'Schepard', 'begging', 'not', 'trust', 'would-be', 'rescuers', 'Surprisingly', 'John', 'Locke', 'previously', 'left', 'dead', 'Linus', 'echo', 'would', 'be', 'killer', 'then', 'story', 'flash-forwards', 'first', 'series', 'based', 'flash-backs', 'see', 'Jack', 'back', 'real-world', 'so', 'speak', 'Jack', 'consumed', 'addiction', 'pain', 'killers', 'compulsion', 'return', 'island', 'somehow', 'unreachable', 'Salvation', ""n't"", 'been', 'kind', 'Jack', 'who', 'now', 'wreck', 'Now', 'know', 'somebody', 'was', 'rescued', 'only', 'question', 'who', 'survived', 'What', 'happened', 'stage', 'set', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'rescue', 'Oceanic', '815.TONIGHT', 'ON', 'LOSTIt', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'flashbacks', 'forwards', 'make', 'feel', '14', 'weeks', 'have', 'gone', 'Several', 'rescuers', 'appear', 'island', 'unclear', 'mean', 'Lost', '815', 'good', 'Jack', 'John', 'have', 'already', 'split', 'survivors', 'two', 'camps', 'civil', 'war', 'averted', 'when', 'armed', 'guerrillas', 'appear', 'island', 'capture', 'Ben', 'splatter', 'anybody', 'who', 'way', 'anybody', 'else', 'matter', 'Ben', 'few', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve', 'one', 'spy', 'rescue', 'future', 'see', 'Hurley', 'unhinged', 'again', 'Sayyid', 'enlisted', 'sort', 'spy', 'working', 'well', 'why', 'spoil', 'Kate', 'day', 'court', 'Jack', 'back', 'looking', 'jovial', 'self', ""'ll"", 'see', 'growing', 'demons', 'will', 'turn', 'messed', 'up', 'Jack', 'seen', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'get', 'great', 'episode', 'Hume', 'life', 'suddenly', 'resemble', 'LOST', 'script', 'being', 'tossed', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'Expanded', 'character', 'studies', 'Ben', 'Linus', 'make', 'formidable', 'character', 'just', 'more', 'formidable', 'general', 'also', 'see', 'greater', 'roles', 'powerful', 'Mr.', 'Widmore', 'vulnerable', 'Juliet', 'Burke.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'shorter', 'season', 'usual', 'writer', 'strike', 'will', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'great', 'arcs', 'plot', 'lines', 'past', 'seasons', 'Also', 'get', 'see', 'favorite', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'dual', 'nature', 'past', 'Juliet', 'lot', 'time', 'then', 'clear', 'LOST', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'reason', 'doubt', 'show', 'almost', 'completely', 'up', 'chance', 'expand', 'newcomers', 'mercenaries', 'scientists', 'flash-forwards', 'seem', 'nifty', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'finely-tuned', 'structure', 'old', 'flashbacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'elegantly', 'stack', 'together', 'chronological', 'terms', 'Unwittingly', 'show', 'when', 'surreptitiously', 'entwining', 'flash-forward', 'flash-back', 'great', 'device', 'causation', 'ai', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'will', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'LOST', 'manages', 'survive', 'flirting', 'disaster', 'almost', 'episode', 'straddling', 'lines', 'science-fiction', 'supernatural', 'ever', 'becoming', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'show', 'More', 'other', 'show', 'LOST', 'have', 'characters', 'swap', 'terms', 'being', 'sympathetic', 'Jack', 'morphing', 'heroic', 'self-righteous', 'power-hungry', 'bad-guy', 'Sawyer', 'real', 'hero', 'Abbreviated', 'plot', 'lines', 'nevertheless', 'set', 'right', 'degree', 'tension', 'keeping', 'glued', 'final', 'shocking', 'scene', 'called', 'wait', 'till', 'season', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NO', 'EXTRAS', 'OR', 'FEATURETTES', 'WERE', 'HARMED', 'OR', 'VIEWED', 'IN', 'THE', 'MAKING', 'OF', 'THIS', 'REVIEW']",N/A

1159939,A2QDPJRVXL7P4F,B0018CWEYY,"Sahra Badou ""Bibliophile""","[2, 5]","This is the best season so far. This time, the episodes move from the present moment to a future one, and back again to the present (previous seasons moved from the present moment to the past). Even though future events are known, in no way does this remove the element of surprise and suspense. The script is very well written and the episodes very entertaining and unpredictable. The acting is top-notch, and you'll find yourself watching one episode after the other. Not such a bad form of addiction after all! No one will be rushing you to the nearest rehab center any time soon!This season tries to explain many riddles, such as the famous button to push on the hour, the strange numbers, the black smoke, the polar bear, Jacob, the powers of the island, etc... However, don't expect all the answers revealed. You'll still find yourself guessing.To really enjoy this season, I recommend you start-off with season 1 through 3. If you have not watched previous seasons, you'll be at a loss, and you probably won't enjoy this series.I watched this season as a download from iTunes. This is the first TV series I download. I watched this series on a Sony Bravia HD TV. The picture and audio were very clear. I found no difference in terms of picture and audio quality between the download and DVD discs. In fact, the download works better for me: I don't have to wait for the DVD discs to arrive in the mail, and I don't pay any shipping charges or extra taxes. Living abroad, the cost of the series gets to be much less! I also noticed that season 4 is still on pre-order on amazon.com. For those who can't wait to watch this series I highly recommend you considering legally downloading the episodes. Downloading also preserves the environment since you won't need all the packaging.

(As with all things LOST, the potential color of the season five box set is fiercely debated, although there is a general consensus that dinosaurs will be involved.)On the other hand, the 'Lost haters', as they are affectionately called, will berate anyone who deigns to spend 40 dollars and untold hours on a Television show that, in their opinion, is worthless tripe. However, these people will still devote several hours of their time to writing reviews about how bad LOST is and how everyone who likes it should be tortured and imprisoned.So, this review is not for those two groups, both of whom made their final decision 4 seasons ago, somewhere around the time the plane crashed on the island. No, this review is for the tiny minority of you who have not been exposed to the LOST phenomenon and have yet to form an opinion you will soon be forced to defend bitterly, and sometimes with violence. You are, in a way, the all important swing voters in a deeply polarized intellectual battle.The forth season of LOST promised a faster pace and more answers than previous seasons, and for the most part it kept that promise. Of course, the events of season 4 created more new mysteries than were put to rest, and ensured that no one could possibly predict where the series was heading.For fans there were enough jaw dropping moments and gratifying resolutions to make this an instant five-star rating. For haters there may be enough answers to bring a few back into the warm embrace of the losties.For the uninitiated: Call in sick for a week and buy enough canned food and bottled water so you don't have to leave your house for 6 days. Buy seasons 1-3 and watch every episode, every disc, back-to-back, only pausing to eat and use the restroom. Do not try to sleep.On day 5 collapse in bed and sleep for 48 hours.

1159946,A3RF46CL8GDIN8,B0018CWEYY,SouthGenie,"[125, 141]","This seasons twists and turns have renewed my interest and respect for Lost. There were no fillers due to the (mostly planned) reduced episode count and even with the writer's strike it was a solid season. There were really only 2 hours lost to the writer's strike anyway, which ABC has stated they will ""give back"" by giving 1 extra hour to the next 2 seasons. The quality of the show this season more than made up for the reduced episode count.It was interesting in the final show of the 3rd season to see Jack's focus change (seen in a flash forward) from getting off the island to getting back on it. This season was spent giving a set up to the reason why without really answering the question but creating enough suspense to make it worth finding out...next season I hope. This season is about who gets off the island (the Oceanic 6, as they're called) and how, and a bit about what they're going to do back in the real world. A few other people also get off the island but they aren't included in ""the Oceanic 6"" and you'll also get a partial reason why by the last episode, as well as finding out who was in the coffin in the final episode of the 3rd season that had Jack so upset (but not why or how.) Jack finally finds out who Claire is to him, but we still don't know what actually happened to her. Ben's character becomes more complex, as we start to see how he manages to go from outcast to leader and gets people to do what he wants (such as Locke, Sayid, and even Jack,) even if they are uneasy in their association with him. Clearly some other Oceanic refugees have escaped the island but we don't know how yet, and it doesn't seem like the ""Oceanic 6"" are necessarily even aware of them.Another interesting addition this season is the newcomers, the ""freighter folk,"" who may as well be the new ""others."" Some are decent people and some are evil, and one will be familiar face from previous seasons. Speaking of ""the others,"" who they are, where they came from, and what is their nature became a new set of unanswered questions this season. I wasn't thrilled with Rosseau's or her daughter's storylines, but it seems what happened was done in order to develop Ben's character.What is planned for extra features is below, it is subject to change since it wasn't released yet.

1159949,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B0018CWEYY,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[0, 0]","THE SEASONA lot of TV shows suffered from the writer's strike last season. Some, like Scrubs, had awful shortened seasons that seemingly cried out, ""I give up!"" Others, like Lost, went with the flow, and managed to deliver not only what fans expected (even if it was slightly different than originally planned), but some of the best work yet in the franchise.Before the fourth season of Lost began, it was announced that the show would end after six seasons, with a definitive ending. (Or so they claim!) This timetable put the entire series of Lost into a scheduled progression, which the strike threw off. The result? Lost lost several episodes in the fourth season, but the talent of the writing staff managed to put out a slightly shortened season that still hit all the major points needed for the show to progress, even if we did lose out on some extra character progression and events.The fourth season of Lost was big for more than being the first filmed with a set-in-stone finale in sight. At the end of season 3, Jack has a flash-forward, going against the previous structure (and identity) of the show. This continues in season 4, as characters no longer flash-back to their past and what they did before they got to the island, but flash-forward to (in some cases) life after the island.This may seem like a cop-out in showing who will make it off and soliciting fan feedback, but in reality it actually greatly changed things. Why? Because some people don't make it off the island. Now, the story of Lost isn't the same ol' ""How do they got off the island? Do they get off the island?"" routine from the last three years, but instead, ""Why does so-and-so not make it?"" Do they stay around? Do they die? Does the group split even further, resulting in some escaping while they leave others behind? Suddenly, Lost regains a whole lot of depth that went missing after the relatively tame second year.The story itself picks up right where season 3 left off, with the gang making contact freight ship crew just offshore, and a helicopter sent to pick them up. Obviously, things don't go according to plan as the freighters have their own agenda.The usual twists and turns (and new character introductions) that fans expect from the series are in full force in season 4. Even though the post-strike episodes feel a bit more rushed and more compacted with events than the pre-strike ones, they still feel like Lost and manage to pacify fans, which is something many shows couldn't do in the WGA strike period. My only complaint about the season is that, compared to the previous three, the finale isn't nearly as big of a revelation. Then again, maybe that's part of a new direction for Lost, too.THE BLU-RAY DISCLost Season 4 is called ""the expanded experience"" on the case, even though it's basically exactly what you saw on TV. That's not the only puzzling feature of the package, either. One of the Blu-ray specific features, SeasonPlay, allows you to keep track of where you are in the season and go directly back to that point. (Since, you know, Blu-rays don't save virtual bookmarks like DVDs.) Unfortunately, it rarely seemed to work as-intended. Another puzzling item is the episode selection menu. Pick that, and it asks you to select which disc you have in. But... shouldn't it be able to tell? The best part is if you accidentally pick the wrong one, it tells you to insert the right disc. Odd.Those issues aside, Lost season 4 on Blu-ray is fantastic, and a great example for TV show releases in the future. Presented in 1080p instead of the HD broadcast's 720p quality, Lost on Blu-ray is noticeably better than Lost on TV; even on the HD channels. Colors are bright, the jungles of Hawaii (err-the ""island"") look fantastic, and the blacks are deep and foreboding. The show also offers one of those awesome-but-oh-so-rare 3D-like effects during the jungle scenes, where the picture is so clear you almost feel like you're there.If I have one complaint, it's that the transfer may be too clear. Plenty of times, you can see makeup and such on the faces of the actors due to the high clarity. On one hand, it's a testament to the quality of the transfer. On the other, nothing takes you out of the moment and scene faster than noticing Jack has some foundation on his cheek.The PCM 5.1 audio is also a great improvement over broadcast quality. Which is impressive, considering the broadcast quality of Lost's audio is already above just about all TV Blu-ray releases. Presented with full surround and in several languages, the score, ambient sounds of the island, and action of the occasional action break are very clear, bump quite well, and will please even the most hardcore of audiophiles.The extra's list, like the previous seasons, is full of hours of goodies. Audio commentary on several episodes, a witty 8:15 recap of the previous Lost seasons, Lost on Location, Lost in Hawaii, the Right to Bear Arms, and the regular bloopers, outtakes, and deleted scenes make the bulk of the featurrettes list.Exclusive to the Blu-ray version are SeasonPlay, which I've already mentioned, excerpts from a live performance of the fantastic Lost score by the Honolulu Symphony Pops Orchestra, and, my favorite feature, Course of the Future. Course of the Future combines the flash-forwards from season 4, and makes them-effectively-one future episode. While on the standard DVD release, on Blu-ray fans can follow specific characters, finding out what (so far) will happen with some of their favorites. Combined all of the flash forwards fill up an entire episode's timeslot, so it's quite an entertaining watch. Footage you've already seen? Sure. But fun to watch again without any switching back-and-forth between time periods? You bet.FINAL WORDLost Season 4 on Blu-ray is, as I've already said, a pinnacle and shining example for TV on Blu-ray. The show's producers know how to film for the format, and it shows. An awesome video and audio transfer, some nice Easter eggs, and more make up the best Lost season 4 package available. While I would have loved to see more Blu-ray specific features, just having all the extras from the DVD in high-def format is enough of a bonus.If you're a fan of Lost, buy this season on Blu-ray. And, if you're new to the series, season 4 is perfectly able to serve as a starting point thanks to the new flash-forward dynamic. So if your friend/loved one is watching it, feel free to jump in. Just expect to be hooked on the show like most of America, and join the long list with those of us asking for a Blu-ray release of the first two seasons to add to our collection.The Show: 5/5The Disc:

1159957,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0018CWEYY,Tom Benton,"[44, 57]","*Possible spoilers within.  Additionally, don't read this if you haven't seen the third season of ""Lost.""*""Lost"" closed its third season with a moment of sheer creative brilliance.  There are moments that make one gasp.  It takes some craftiness to make these moments satisfying, but even as early as its first few scenes, ""Lost"" had secured itself as the supreme ruler of gasp moments.  Then there are moments that change one's perception of everything -- and these are few and far between.  But no moment has ever been quite like that final scene of ""Lost""'s third season.  ""Lost"" is about a group of people who survive a plane crash and need to get off the bizarre island they've crashed on.  Yet in that series-altering, mind-boggling moment, we found out we were wrong.  The series wasn't about getting off the island.  It was about the island itself.  How did we know that?  Because the final scene was a flashforward.And guess what?  THEY GET OFF THE ISLAND.So where does the show go from here?That brings us to Season Four.  ""Lost"" has always been a superb show, but within Season Four, it enters the ranks of the all-time television elite.  People, this is one of the finest seasons of television I have ever seen.  As ever, I'll try to convey some of the wonder I experienced watching this season within this review - but you really have to see it for yourself.Last year ABC made a deal with the show's brains, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, that ensured they would be able to tell the entire ""Lost"" story.  That was a step forward for the TV biz, an industry which has been changing more and more as of late.  The deal states that ""Lost"" will air six seasons, with the final season airing in 2010.  Initially, each season would contain 16 episodes.  Then the WGA strike hit.  Due to the strike, the season wound up with 14 episodes; the remaining 2 episodes will wind up as the 17th episodes of Seasons Five and Six.  In the case of ""Lost,"" the strike was a great thing.  More so than any other season of the show, Season Four has a straight story to tell.  Over the season's 14 episodes, that story is told fast, vividly, and without a wasted moment.  We wouldn't have had that if the strike hadn't forced the writers to pack everything in a little.  Kudos to the WGA for that.Speaking of storytelling, wow.  Joss Whedon is the greatest writer the television industry has ever seen, and I don't think even he could tell a story like this.  Lindelof and Cuse are among the most creative visionaries the medium has ever had.  They continue to take us to places that one could never imagine.  Most importantly, because they have now successfully planned many of the show's central storylines, one knows that they aren't just pulling these shocks out of a hat - it's all part of the plan.  The rest of the writers deserve a ton of credit as well.  They have done a fantastic job of fleshing out characters and storylines convincingly and naturally.  The show has no shortage of character development; as usual, one can expect to be pretty surprised at where some of these guys wind up and what they do by the season's end.  Above all else, though, ""Lost"" moves along its storylines at such a roaring pace that no series could hope to compare.  My one complaint about the WGA strike: certain topics which the writers had hoped to tackle by the season's end, like the curious case of Marvin Candle/Edgar Hallowax or the four-toed statue, are still wide open.  But that's a small complaint.  The writing hasn't been this good since Season One.It's no surprise, then, that Season Four produced some of the series' finest episodes.  There isn't a bad episode in the season.  The fierce pace of the season ensures that the lesser episodes are only the ones where the pace lets up (though even then, the show is moving much faster than any other on TV).  The least of the bunch are the sixth and tenth episodes of the season, ""The Other Woman"" and ""Something Nice Back Home,"" respectively.  Every episode is so high in quality that each deserves to be mentioned here.  I won't do that.  What I will do is mention the cream of the crop: episode 5, ""The Constant.""  If you haven't heard about it already, ""The Constant"" is the best episode of the entire show, as well as one of the finest episodes of television in history.  The storyline involves Desmond (the utterly magnificent Henry Ian Cusick) becoming unstuck in time (think ""Slaughterhouse-Five"") and flashing between 2004 and 1996.  Desmond must find a way to become fastened to 2004 again before the strain of the time travel becomes too much and he dies.  The acting is extraodinary, the writing ingenious, and the directing -- something ""Lost"" gets too little attention for -- is absolutely top-notch.  ""Time"" magazine (how's that for ironic?) compared ""The Constant"" to ""No Country for Old Men"" in an attempt to figure out whether movies or television were superior.  They concluded that, thanks to pieces like ""The Constant,"" television was far superior.  Brother, if you haven't yet seen ""The Constant,"" you are in for one heck of a treat.  It is affecting and powerful in ways one would never have dreamt television could be before recent times.Cusick, who should already have won an Emmy, is definitely eligible for one after his turn in that episode.  He's not alone, either.  The Emmys are about as sensible as the Oscars (""Buffy"" never won a THING!), but come on -- if these actors don't win anything next time 'round, a serious crime will have been committed.  First up: Michael Emerson.  Emerson has been one of the show's greatest delights since his first appearance midway through Season Two.  He brings the marvelously weasely character of Ben Linus to life in a way that no other actor ever could.  His greatest turn is in the Ben-centric episode ""The Shape of Things to Come"" (which, by the way, is a series highlight).  Thanks to Emerson (and almost solely so), Ben is as fascinating as any character on television today.  There are moments when he is as cruel and evil as a human being could be, but somehow we understand him, and we understand that deep down, he is good.  He is fighting for what he believes, no matter the cost to anyone.  It's hard to explain this.Easier to explain: the greatness of Matthew Fox.  Just how great is Matthew Fox?  Jack has had his ups and downs, but Fox has been consistently great.  This season, though, Fox hits an all-time high.  He is spectacular.  Desperate Island Jack only gives Fox so much to do, but Future Off-Island Jack opens all sorts of doors for Fox's acting.  Jack's torment is palpable.  You can taste it, you can see it.  It's heartbreaking.  It takes a truly talented actor to pull that off, especially considering that Off-Island Jack is the exact opposite of Island Jack, the version which Fox typically plays.Honorable mentions: Naveen Andrews, who is fascinatingly complex in one of the season's most intriguing episodes, ""The Economost.""  Yunjin Kim gets chances to shine in flash-forwards, and shine she does.  Evangeline Lilly does some of her best work on the show, particularly in the flash-forwards.  And last but certainly not least, Alan Dale is truly menacing as Charles Widmore.  Widmore was a charmingly Scrooge-ish character in his previous two appearances on the show, but this season we become aware of just how integral he is to the series' mythology.  Dale is a perfect fit for so deviously sophisticated a character.But wait - there's more.  The members of Widmore's freighter team are each played by knockout actors.  Jeremy Davies, the greatest character actor in the business, is just incredible as the wacky, eccentric scientist Daniel Faraday.  Supporting him are Ken Leung as the wisecracking psychic Miles, who will no doubt prove important in the future, and Rebecca Mader as the mysterious Charlotte.  Jeff Fahey is a real pleasure as pilot Frank Lapidus, who may be the most humanistic character on the entire show.  Finally, Kevin Durand.  This guy is a killer.  Well, he's a killer actor, but his character is one of the most frightening, eerie, and downright nasty villains to hit the small screen.The crew behind the camera does not get enough attention.  ""Lost"" is beautifully shot and the directing is the best on television.  Jack Bender, possibly the series' most-used director, is particularly great.  This season, though, it's Michael Giacchino who really shines.  Giacchino's music elevates television scoring into a place it hasn't been since Angelo Badalamenti composed the music for ""Twin Peaks.""  His music truly enhances the series.  It can be ghastly, it can be tense, it can epic, and it can be emotional, but the one thing it is always is beautiful.  Just give him his Emmy now.At the season's end, we still don't know where ""Lost"" will go next.  The three-part finale is a monumental affair, offering twists and turns that are astounding even by this series' high standards.  What it doesn't offer is much of a clue where the series is headed -- and as far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing.  That will be important for keeping the show in our head as we endure the strenuous eight month wait for the series to return.  It's worth waiting for, though.  Television storytelling has rarely been so grandly-plotted or clearly-executed as in ""Lost""'s spectacular fourth season.

Season 4 just kicked some major booty. Absolutely everything you could ever ask for in a show is within this Season. Not since the first Season has Lost been THIS good. The only downside is the fact that it is not as long as the other seasons.There are surprises and twists galore. The characters old and new are interesting and engaging. The actors all do a fantastic job, it's just so obvious that they enjoy working on this show. The story line can get a tad confusing a times, but it really does come together (for the most part). Yes there are more questions, even though some have been answered. But that is why this show really grips people. There are so many emotions packed into the season, each episode is a practical cliffhanger and teaser to the next one. It's almost mind-consuming.The mysteries and intriguing and you WANT to watch every single episode, because if you miss even one, you're basically screwed and out of the loop. I really can't say enough about this show.  And it really does appeal to alot of different people and age ranges. It's great to watch it on DVD so you're not dealing with the commercials.

Much in the way that the original Twilight Zone could at times, only I think Lost may even do it better. Some things in this season especially, I will say, are only as real (or unreal) as you want them to be. Much of the premise is left widely to interpretation, especially in this season, where the pacing of the show has changed a bit.  We now have almost no sense of what ""real"" time actually is, and can see into the future time events of our characters, as well as the past.  As one reviewer already explained, the issue with time is a lot more relevant now, then it had been before, as it seems that things that happen outside of the island, happen at a different time pace than things on the island.The season is very short (14 episodes) and in those fourteen episodes we span about seven days on the island (real time [?])  we cover clips that span the survivors rescue from the island, to about three years in the future (which is 2007, since real time events all take place in 2004) and the flashback sequences continue to become more tripped out and frenetic as they go, a steady pace that has been rising since the first season. We get one flashback that may not actually be a flashback at all, one flashfoward that is actually a flashback, and a time line that is now more of an explosion and dissaray of time all together. What exactly is time anyway?... I don't think our magic island really cares about all that.People on Lost island start having some weird dreams... and i gotta tell ya, as a viewer of the TV show, I had one or two weird dreams about the show myself, as it is completely in my head. Which is a little F'd up.

1159962,AP3B615GM191G,B0018CWEYY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[4, 6]","Though shorter than the previous three seasons of the show (partly due to starting in January, and partly due to the writer's strike), the fourth season of LOST is just as compelling as ever.In reference to the main ""mythology"" plotlines, for the first time this season the real possibility of rescue is touched on.  Also, a dramatic shift (as a result of the Jack vs. Locke feud) is made in the way the castaways are aligned on the island, and as a result we learn that perhaps Ben Linus has not always been the leader of the Others.  Finally, picking up on a seemingly forgotten plot thread of a past season, this season really delves into the notion that the perception of time on the island is not the same perception of time in the outside world.As for the more personal, dramatic storytelling that LOST has become known for, this season picks right up where season three's shocker (""we have to go back, Kate!) left off, flashing forward into the future instead of back to the past.  By doing this, the writers/producers were able to keep the dramatic stories fresh, essentially revealing the future location of certain ""Losties"" and then filling in the gaps as to how/why he/she ended up at that point.To conclude, the fourth season of LOST keeps up the show's high-quality tradition of mind-bending plots (this season is heavy on those with the time-altering angle), action/adventure, and compelling drama.  By the season finale, when the person in the coffin is revealed (and you will be dying to know how he/she ended up there), the show will have taken on almost a completely new ""real time"" (perhaps episodes will now flashback from the future?!).
