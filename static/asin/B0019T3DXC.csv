1164712,A34MNND2ITVQ13,B0019T3DXC,Angela S.,"[1, 2]","A solid B movie. It's worth watching for the beautiful cinematography; plus, Central America and South America is gorgeous and stunning.Conner dumps his wife-to-be after he discovers a particular truth about her. He decides to head down to Central America to forget her and several weeks later he meets up with a married couple who are seeking to smash the world record in crossing the Darien (over 125 miles of impassable jungle separating Panama and Colombia). Naturally, Conner decides to join the trek. It is an adventure story, a love story, but mostly a coming of age story and discovering what happiness and contentment requires. It has humor and tenderness but can be a bit trite. You will have to suspend your belief during some parts of the story but overall, not a bad two hours of your time if you like travel stories.",3,A solid B movie,1268352000,"03 12, 2010",2010,830,"['solid', 'B', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Central', 'America', 'South', 'America', 'gorgeous', 'stunning.Conner', 'dumps', 'wife-to-be', 'particular', 'truth', 'head', 'down', 'Central', 'America', 'forget', 'several', 'weeks', 'later', 'up', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'seeking', 'smash', 'world', 'record', 'crossing', 'Darien', '125', 'miles', 'impassable', 'jungle', 'separating', 'Panama', 'Colombia', 'Naturally', 'Conner', 'join', 'trek', 'adventure', 'story', 'love', 'story', 'mostly', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'discovering', 'what', 'happiness', 'contentment', 'humor', 'tenderness', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'trite', 'will', 'have', 'suspend', 'belief', 'parts', 'story', 'overall', 'not', 'bad', 'two', 'hours', 'time', 'like', 'travel', 'stories']",Art of Travel
1164713,A3JNK8I4IC8KV1,B0019T3DXC,"Brian Allen ""neotropical birding""","[4, 7]","I am surprised at the very positive reviews given above for this film.  I had been hesitant at renting the film as there were no positive reviews on the DVD cover as usual if a film has been very positively reviewed or has won awards at any of a number of film festivals that have multiplied around the world (Most companies would surely advertise any positive review on the DVD cover).I rented the DVD as it looked interesting and was about one area that I had traveled in (Darien, Panama) and two that I would like to visit (Nicaragua and Peru).  I also thought it couldn't be that bad to watch a film set in the warm colorful tropics while suffering through another  dreary cold Michigan weekend.The film had it's moments but they were very few and far between.  I enjoyed the shots of Kuna villages in Panama, the overflight of what seemed to be authentic views of the rugged Darien province of Panama and of course who would not enjoy seeing footage of Machu Pichu and the Andes of Peru.The Plot was choppy and loosely connected.  The main character ditches his bride at the wedding alter and leaves for Central America.  There is no character development to help you see what led up to this action or to share any joy in his dramatic flight from his situation.  There are several scenes that are almost funny about how difficult it is to have a working shower in Nicaragua and some nudity thrown in to try to keep the viewers interest I imagine.Off to the Darien in Panama for a record breaking attempt at crossing the roadless jungle with a jeep and a group of young adventurers.  Sounds exciting but somehow they made it seem dull.  There were moments as I mentioned above but mostly the film moved slowly with lots of machete chops, some lame heroic rescues of the jeep topped off by a very silly and improbable encounter with the leader of the FARC guerrilla movement from Columbia.  My wife had long since stopped watching to go read a book but I continued hoping for at least some more scenery or perhaps some saving dialogue.The filming of Machu Pichu was gorgeous but I would bet anyone with equipment set up there couldn't fail to impress if they tried.  The film ends up travelogue/romance with a somewhat abrupt ending that was at least a little funny but did not resurrect my opinion.  I admire the film-makers choice of a novel setting away from American suburbia but left feeling that I had just watched an amateur film supported by someone's rich uncle that didn't care about the quality of the product.",2,Amature Film Not Saved by Exotic Film Locations,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,2524,"['am', 'surprised', 'very', 'positive', 'reviews', 'given', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'hesitant', 'renting', 'film', 'were', 'positive', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'cover', 'usual', 'film', 'been', 'very', 'positively', 'reviewed', 'won', 'awards', 'number', 'film', 'festivals', 'have', 'multiplied', 'world', 'Most', 'companies', 'would', 'surely', 'advertise', 'positive', 'review', 'DVD', 'cover', 'rented', 'DVD', 'looked', 'interesting', 'was', 'one', 'area', 'had', 'traveled', 'Darien', 'Panama', 'two', 'would', 'like', 'visit', 'Nicaragua', 'Peru', 'also', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'that', 'bad', 'watch', 'film', 'set', 'warm', 'colorful', 'tropics', 'suffering', 'dreary', 'cold', 'Michigan', 'weekend.The', 'film', 'had', 'moments', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'far', 'enjoyed', 'shots', 'Kuna', 'villages', 'Panama', 'overflight', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'authentic', 'views', 'rugged', 'Darien', 'province', 'Panama', 'course', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'footage', 'Machu', 'Pichu', 'Andes', 'Peru.The', 'Plot', 'was', 'choppy', 'loosely', 'connected', 'main', 'character', 'bride', 'wedding', 'alter', 'Central', 'America', 'character', 'development', 'help', 'see', 'what', 'led', 'up', 'action', 'share', 'joy', 'dramatic', 'flight', 'situation', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'funny', 'how', 'difficult', 'have', 'working', 'shower', 'Nicaragua', 'nudity', 'thrown', 'try', 'keep', 'viewers', 'interest', 'imagine.Off', 'Darien', 'Panama', 'record', 'breaking', 'attempt', 'crossing', 'roadless', 'jungle', 'jeep', 'group', 'young', 'adventurers', 'exciting', 'somehow', 'made', 'seem', 'dull', 'were', 'moments', 'mentioned', 'mostly', 'film', 'moved', 'slowly', 'lots', 'machete', 'chops', 'lame', 'heroic', 'rescues', 'jeep', 'topped', 'off', 'very', 'silly', 'improbable', 'encounter', 'leader', 'FARC', 'guerrilla', 'movement', 'Columbia', 'My', 'wife', 'had', 'long', 'stopped', 'watching', 'go', 'read', 'book', 'continued', 'hoping', 'least', 'more', 'scenery', 'perhaps', 'saving', 'dialogue.The', 'filming', 'Machu', 'Pichu', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'would', 'bet', 'anyone', 'equipment', 'set', 'up', 'there', 'could', ""n't"", 'fail', 'impress', 'tried', 'film', 'up', 'travelogue/romance', 'somewhat', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'was', 'least', 'little', 'funny', 'did', 'not', 'resurrect', 'opinion', 'admire', 'film-makers', 'choice', 'novel', 'setting', 'away', 'American', 'suburbia', 'left', 'feeling', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'amateur', 'film', 'supported', 'someone', 'rich', 'uncle', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'quality', 'product']",Art of Travel
1164714,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0019T3DXC,Brian E. Erland,"[1, 1]","Who among us hasn't been struck by wanderlust at one time or another in our life, that burning desire to leave everything behind, at least for awhile and partake in the adventure of a lifetime?Synopsis: Such is the case for Conner Layne, a young man on the verge of marriage just weeks before entering college. When he discovers his bride-to-be has been unfaithful he literally leaves her at the altar, goes to the airport and asks the question at the ticket both that we would all love to utter, ""Where's your next flight to?"" And so begins young Conner's adventure into the jungles of Latin America.Critique: `The Art of Travel"" (2008) held my rapt interest from beginning to end. As with most independent films there probably aren't any names you'll recognize but a few faces maybe vaguely familiar. The star of this little gem is Christopher Masterson (Conner) who appeared as the oldest brother in the popular `Malcom in the Middle' television series. His character is likable, believable and surprisingly vulnerable. His jungle companion and new love interest Angelika Baran also delivers a memorable performance and her stunning good looks certainly doesn't hurt. Actually the entire cast does a wonderful job and despite what some other reviewers have written about this film there's definitely nothing amateurish about it on any level. At least that's my opinion. By the way, there's some beautiful scenic sequences as well.",4,"""Where's Your Next Flight To?"" ~ Where The Highway Ends And The Jungle Begins",1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,1433,"['Who', ""n't"", 'been', 'struck', 'wanderlust', 'one', 'time', 'life', 'burning', 'desire', 'leave', 'everything', 'least', 'awhile', 'partake', 'adventure', 'lifetime', 'Synopsis', 'Such', 'case', 'Conner', 'Layne', 'young', 'man', 'verge', 'marriage', 'just', 'weeks', 'entering', 'college', 'When', 'bride-to-be', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'literally', 'altar', 'airport', 'question', 'ticket', 'would', 'love', 'utter', 'Where', 'next', 'flight', 'so', 'young', 'Conner', 'adventure', 'jungles', 'Latin', 'America.Critique', 'Art', 'Travel', '2008', 'held', 'rapt', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end', 'most', 'independent', 'films', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'names', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'few', 'maybe', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'star', 'little', 'gem', 'Christopher', 'Masterson', 'Conner', 'who', 'appeared', 'oldest', 'brother', 'popular', 'Malcom', 'Middle', 'television', 'series', 'character', 'likable', 'believable', 'surprisingly', 'vulnerable', 'jungle', 'companion', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Angelika', 'Baran', 'also', 'memorable', 'performance', 'stunning', 'good', 'looks', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Actually', 'entire', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'job', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'film', 'definitely', 'nothing', 'amateurish', 'level', 'least', 'opinion', 'way', 'beautiful', 'scenic', 'sequences', 'as', 'well']",Art of Travel
1164715,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0019T3DXC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 2]","I was actually quite eager in watching Thomas Whelan's ""The Art of Travel"" because many people including myself have this unsettling curiosity to travel different parts of the world.  Enjoy the culture, the art, the atmosphere, the cuisine but there are those who just go for it and there are those who sit idly and continue to ponder if one should or should not travel.And I happen to be the latter, despite having traveled to a few beautiful countries, there are far too many countries and areas that I have yet to visit and often tell myself, ""when will I go for it!""So, here we are with ""The Art of Travel, an independent film written by Brian La Belle and Thomas Whelan about Conner Layne (played by Christopher Masterson, ""Malcolm in the Middle"" who is preparing to get married to his sweetheart Kate (played by Alex Breckenridge).Unfortunately, he discovers that she has been cheating on him (and sleeping with his best friend) and at the wedding ceremony, dumps her and with what money he has, decides he needs to get away.And where most people would probably just go to the nearby bar or somewhere nearby to get away, Conner actually flies out to Nicaragua in a beat-up, dangerous part of town.  Gets robbed multiple times andHe eventually meets up with a few women, hooks up with Swedish blondes and somehow manages to enjoy his stay in Nicaragua.Instead of going back home, Conner then goes to Panama and meets a friendly couple - Darlene (played by Brooke Burns) and Christopher (played by Johnny Messner) who invite Conner to join them in their quest to cross the Darien Gap, 100 miles of thick, undeveloped jungle in record time.This begins the adventure for Conner as he learns more about himself through traveling with Christopher, Darlene and the various team members and along the way, manages to find new love.By watching this film, there are so many paths that this film could have gone.  Especially, playing out various cliches of good people travel, bad people try to kill them or something dire.  Fortunately, ""The Art of Travel"" avoids any of that.  Sure, there are some dire moments but none that are cliche.If anything, I found myself hooked and mesmerized by the variety of footage filmed in various countries and where the storyline could have ended with Conner trekking the jungles and succeeding, the film explores his passion for traveling.During the first half hour of the film, I found myself questioning Connor Layne's character.  How could one not truly be upset with the terrible things that happen in his life.  Fiance messing around, being robbed multiple times, especially trekking through the jungle with a ragtag group of people for over a year doesn't seem to bother him.  Connor doesn't panic, in fact... you rarely see him get upset.  He just takes things as is and moves on.  Christopher Masterson plays a very interesting individual and you obviously see his character grow from beginning to end, which was good to see but rarely have I met anyone who would not get upset if those things happened to them.As for the other cast members, Brooke Burns and Johnny Messner as the couple who lead the adventure through the Darien Gap are limited in their roles.  Brooke Burn's Darlene is pretty much the loving wife and supportive of her husband Christopher.  As for Messner's Christopher, you really don't know if this guy is shady or what is his motivation until midway into the film when you realize that tragedy and knowing that life is too short is what has prompted him to conquer Darien Gap.Conner is joined by a team of explorers which include James Duval (who played Randy Quaid's son in ""Independence Day"") and as much as their role are just the muscle and the outspoken mouths of the team, the character that shines is Angelika Baran who plays the character of Anna, who becomes the love partner of Conner.Both Conner and Anna are the ones who experience the travel through various countries and their love for traveling shows.  From beautiful cinematography, really good selections for shots showcasing the beauty of many areas of South America.  The scenes with both Conner and Anna are breathtaking and also painful.Also, it was good to see Maria Conchita Alonso again, this time playing Conner's mother (although some may find it hard to picture Conner Layne having a Bolivian mother) and Christopher Masteron's brother's (Danny Masterson, ""That 70's show) real-life girlfriend Bijou Phillips playing the part as Conner's younger sister.Sure, there are some problems with the film from Conner's non-flinching behavior, the whole Swedish blonde beauties showing off their bare breasts immediately to Conner and wanting him to come into their room is like something that is just pure fantasy novel.  And then you have Conner playing the guitar and singing ""The Rainbow Connection"" in Kermit the Frog style fashion (unless that's Christopher Masterson's real singing voice) that was a bit cheesy.  And he's playing to his friends and a small group of children and you wonder to yourself when did they enter a village with kids?  And with a year nearly trekking through that jungle, was there really enough gas for the jeep to last that long?  How much beer did they really take with them.  Somehow the beer to food ratio was staggering. And after watching so much ""LOST"" on television, you wonder what the team had to eat and did they have to go hunting for wild animals?  Granted, I probably wouldn't want to see them hunting wild pigs or poisonous snakes ala ""Man vs. Wild"" but I thought about it during the film.Those are just a little of the small things in the film that irked me but overall, I found ""The Art of Travel"" to be an inspiring film because many people would love to travel and many don't, may it be the reasons of financial or family obligations or other reasons but to watch a group of people doing it, for the sake of doing it because they want to.Their hunger to do it is what makes everything possible.  Conner passes up attending Cal Berkeley to focus on his traveling, Anna has done it and kept traveling since and of course, with Christopher, wanting to do in memory of the love ones in life that were lost.The final act features Conner traveling to various countries and immersing himself in the culture.  No, this is not Rick Steves on PBS, Conner is not traveling to the best areas of Europe but areas in the world that only the hardcore travelers would enjoy and that is living off minimal supplies and enjoying the lifestyle of the natives.Truly an inspirational storyline enhanced by beautiful cinematography and beautiful locations within South America.  And overall a story that I did enjoy.VIDEO:Fortunately the video is featured in 169 widescreen.  Again, the visuals are just beautiful when you get to see the serene areas of South America.AUDIO:Audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround.  Also, English SDH and Spanish Subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:This is where I was a bit disappointed.  With so much traveling featured in various countries, it would have been wonderful to have commentary or even a featurette.  But  there was nothing but previews.  Eliminating the previews, there really aren't any major special features.This is one of those films that you would imagine there being a lot of behind-the-scenes footage, gag reel or interviews with the cast.  There were production diaries for the film available on YouTube but even if these were included on the DVD would have been cool.  So, I was a bit disappointed about that there were no special features included on the DVD.For those of you who enjoy traveling or have future plans of traveling, especially to South America, definitely give ""the Art of Travel"" a try.It's a very ambitious independent film that features beautiful scenery that will not just inspire you but a storyline that I found refreshing that it was not a film that incorporated too many cliches, nor was it boring or mundane.I saw the film as an evolution of the character Layne in several acts.  The first of a man who is lost.  The second of a man who is getting to know more about himself.  The third of a man who finds love but what ""love"" in his life is he willing to devote his life to?  And the final act that shows how the man has grown through his passion for traveling.I enjoyed ""The Art of Travel"" for its inspirational storyline and its beautiful atmosphere.  I just wish the DVD went further in featuring that beauty via a featurette with behind-the-scenes footage, getting the cast and creators to discuss the making of the film via interviews or commentary.  I just wanted more after watching the film.  But at least you can find the production diaries on YouTube.But overall, ""The Art of Travel"" is a film worth watching.",4,"A beautiful, lush film that features the thrill of traveling with risk and

It really brings places like Machu Picchu to life! The film is a really fun adventure that never seems to stop. One place leads to another as you explore different cultures with this guy who is discovering who he is. The guy is the older brother from Malcolm in the Middle (I watching that show) - its great to see that he's still working on some really cool projects.
