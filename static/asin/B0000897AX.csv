And the great thing about it is that my husband, older children, and myself enjoyed watching it the first several times too!!!  This definitely not a kids video in that it was created for adults,  but kids seem to love it.  I have bought it for gifts for little boys knowing that parents will thank me.",5,My son loves this,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,436,"['bought', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'three', 'now', 'watched', 'repeatedly', 'past', 'year', 'go', 'video', 'great', 'thing', 'husband', 'older', 'children', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'first', 'several', 'times', 'too', 'definitely', 'not', 'kids', 'video', 'was', 'created', 'adults', 'kids', 'seem', 'love', 'have', 'bought', 'gifts', 'little', 'boys', 'knowing', 'parents', 'will', 'thank']",Straight Up: Helicopters in Action

736345,A1ZUC46ZCE8H8A,B0000897AX,"M Olson ""molson24""","[1, 1]","I've loved helicopters for as long as I can remember.  I've worked two summers in Alaska at the premier Helicopter Tour Guide company in the southeast, and spent a lot of time around them (mostly A-stars, B2's, some conversions, also a 214 and few 500's).  This documentary makes me miss them all.  The information is accurate, pertinent, interesting and engaging.  The aircraft featured are from a wide variety of manufacturers, regions and purposes.  The narration isn't spectacular, but I don't watch it because of the writing.  I watch it because of the filming.  The locations, style and subject all vary for each portion.I recommend this film to any parent with kids like me, and any helicopter enthusiast, whether your burgeoning or full-blown.",5,helicopter enthusiast,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",2010,751,"[""'ve"", 'loved', 'helicopters', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'two', 'summers', 'Alaska', 'premier', 'Helicopter', 'Tour', 'Guide', 'company', 'southeast', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'mostly', 'A-stars', 'B2', 'conversions', 'also', '214', 'few', '500', 'documentary', 'miss', 'information', 'accurate', 'pertinent', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'aircraft', 'featured', 'are', 'wide', 'variety', 'manufacturers', 'regions', 'purposes', 'narration', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'writing', 'watch', 'filming', 'locations', 'style', 'subject', 'vary', 'portion.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'parent', 'kids', 'helicopter', 'enthusiast', 'burgeoning', 'full-blown']",Straight Up: Helicopters in Action

The ""making of"" was more interesting than the show but it too had little content. Worth about a 1/3 of its price.
