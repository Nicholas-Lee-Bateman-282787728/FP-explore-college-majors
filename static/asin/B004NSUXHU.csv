Period dramas are a mainstay of Masterpiece Theater and BBC dramas in general but most are based on classic works of literature rather than originally scripted dramas. The fact that this is originally scripted by Andrew Davies allows Downton Abbey to examine the period and the enormous social changes taking place with a modern sensibility that wows viewers.The Crawley family has adjusted to the fact that a distant cousin is now the heir to Downton and that he and Lady Mary will not marry. Now the heir is threatened by WWI; Matthew may die as so many young men did in that terrible war. The scheming Thomas is also in the trenches of WWI, but in true Thomas fashion plots to get out and find himself a safe sinecure in which to ride out the war. Lady Mary is seeking a suitable husband as Matthew has chosen elsewhere and Lord Crawley is coping with the fact that his war will be on the homefront. Bateses wife returns with consequences to all memebers of the household both upstairs and down. The younger girls are doing war work. Indeed, the set-up for a marvelous dramatic season is in place.Downton Abbey is well-written, well acted and has beautiful production values. The house where it is set is used for both interiors and exteriors and the viewer gets a veritable tour of a stately house. The costumes are wonderful and are showing the nascent beginnings of what will become Art Deco. Truly I can't find a single criticism of this wonderful period drama and neither can the record number of viewers worldwide. If you aren't already a fan start watching at your earliest possible convenience.

Season one of Downton Abbey got me hooked, and the second season kept me hooked.  I love the story line, and how it unfolds...  of course, there are a couple of things that bug me, but nothing major.I think that the characters are played pretty well flawlessly.  I would occasionally yell out much-needed advice to them, much to the amusement of my husband.  ""They can't hear you"" eventually became ""Still can't"" when he realized that I was going to yell things anyway.I was angry when Robert -- feeling lonely and misunderstood -- acted like a big baby, as well as when any character did horrible things (I'm looking at you, Thomas and O'Brien).  I felt sorry for them when things didn't go their way, and their human vulnerability showed (yes, even you, Thomas and O'Brien).  I sighed and ""oohed and aahed"" when romance appeared, and I was jealous of Lavinia for Mary.  I could go on... there is something to be said about everyone, but I think you get the picture.  In my opinion, the show is written very well and the characters are developing very well, though not always in the directions one might like.Are some parts predictable?  Yes.  Are some parts kind of cliche?  Sure.  But, that's all right with me; the good far outweighs the bad.Of course, I had a couple of minor issues.  First, I almost hate to say this, but I felt that Cora kind of started to sound a bit like Carol Channing.  I know that she is supposed to be patient and loving, but that voice change got on my nerves a little.  Also, what the heck is going on with Bates?  He's like a false-accusation magnet!  Good grief... I hope it all works out for Anna and him, but also hope that things don't get too drawn out.Neither of these minor issues affected my enjoyment of the show in the least.

1421387,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B004NSUXHU,Andy Orrock,"[5, 6]","This addictive series continued its excellence into Season 2.  It succeeded in introducing a couple of new characters into the mix without watering or muddling the plot.  Most notably, it gave Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) a fianc&eacute;e - Lavinia Swire as played by Zoe Boyle - and Lady Mary Crawley (cast standout Michelle Dockery) a fianc&eacute; - Sir Richard Carlisle as played by Iain Glen.  Both additions are very effective...for very different reasons: Swire because she's likable and winning, even to putative romantic rival Lady Mary; Carlisle because he is wonderfully complex, scheming and increasingly unlikable (by design).  And, it turns out that Carlisle has the goods on both Lady Mary (news of her dalliance with the Turkish diplomat is something he both thwarts as press baron and wields as potential partner) and Lavinia (he also threatens to expose a family secret of hers).  How that foursome plays out is one of the dominant arcs of Season 2.Writer Julian Fellowes triumph is that he balances that compelling thread with a number of others of interest to viewers.  The next of particular note is maid Anna's romance with Brendan Coyle's Mr. Bates, valet to Hugh Bonneville's Lord Robert Crawley.  Coyle - an unlikely sex symbol if there ever was one (as he laughingly admits) - is put through the gamut of the highest highs and lowest lows.  The high: the hand in marriage to Joanne Froggatt's Anna, the emotional anchor of story.  She's the story's single most lovable character - pure, ardent, resolute, slyly beautiful.  The low: tried for murder for the death of his despicable first wife.  To say that Season 2 does not end on a high note for Mr. Bates is vastly understating the case.Season 2 is also notable for a slow-rising malaise in Bonneville's Lord of the manor.  His inability to play a meaningful role in the war has obviously eaten at him, as has his general disgust with the senselessness of the war.  Matthew's injuries have brought this home to him in the most personal of manners.  His low state comes out first with his increased irritation with wife, Cora (Elizabeth McGovern).  But from the second he intersects with new housemaid, Jane Moorsum, I said immediately ""uh-oh.""  Jane's backstory - husband killed in the war, saddled with a young son to raise - resonates with Crawley's lament of war's tragic outcomes.  And, those piercing blue eyes of Clare Calbraith's give you a pretty good idea of where this part of the story is headed.My only complaint about Season 2 is that a couple of the plotlines seem too contrived.  Matthew goes from probable transected spine to miracle walker to a full-out, full-powered grappling with Sir Richard in a matter of a couple of episodes.  [It's notable that in the ""Making Of"" featurette Bonneville joking shouts ""It's a miracle"" as Stevens arises from his wheelchair without assistance...and Stevens all but rolls his eyes when he says ""I'm assuming Julian did his research...""]  And the series threatened to go totally off the rails with an almost inexplicable visit to the house by a wounded, disfigured Canadian solider claiming to be Mary's ex-fianc&eacute; thought to be lost on the Titanic sinking.  His cause and claim are only believed by often overlooked middle sister, Edith.  That plot is quickly discarded, hopefully because Fellowes realized the ridiculousness of it.  The show is renowned for its well-scripted stories.  That one was a clear outlier...absurd in both its premise and presence in this otherwise excellent series.Can't wait for Season 3...especially after learning that Shirley MacLaine is the 'Grandmama' that Lady Mary aims to spend time with over the coming year (to let Sir Richard's loud, probable bombshell play out).",5,This addictive series continued its excellence into Season 2,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,3742,"['addictive', 'series', 'continued', 'excellence', 'Season', '2', 'succeeded', 'introducing', 'couple', 'new', 'characters', 'mix', 'watering', 'muddling', 'plot', 'Most', 'notably', 'gave', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Lavinia', 'Swire', 'played', 'Zoe', 'Boyle', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'Crawley', 'cast', 'standout', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Carlisle', 'played', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'additions', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'very', 'different', 'reasons', 'Swire', 'likable', 'winning', 'even', 'putative', 'romantic', 'rival', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'Carlisle', 'wonderfully', 'complex', 'scheming', 'increasingly', 'unlikable', 'design', 'out', 'Carlisle', 'goods', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'news', 'dalliance', 'Turkish', 'diplomat', 'something', 'thwarts', 'press', 'baron', 'wields', 'potential', 'partner', 'Lavinia', 'also', 'expose', 'family', 'secret', 'hers', 'How', 'foursome', 'plays', 'out', 'one', 'dominant', 'arcs', 'Season', '2.Writer', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'triumph', 'compelling', 'thread', 'number', 'others', 'interest', 'viewers', 'next', 'particular', 'note', 'maid', 'Anna', 'romance', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'Mr.', 'Bates', 'valet', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'Lord', 'Robert', 'Crawley', 'Coyle', 'unlikely', 'sex', 'symbol', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'laughingly', 'put', 'gamut', 'highest', 'highs', 'lowest', 'lows', 'high', 'hand', 'marriage', 'Joanne', 'Froggatt', 'Anna', 'emotional', 'anchor', 'story', 'story', 'single', 'most', 'lovable', 'character', 'pure', 'ardent', 'resolute', 'slyly', 'beautiful', 'low', 'tried', 'murder', 'death', 'despicable', 'first', 'wife', 'say', 'Season', '2', 'not', 'end', 'high', 'note', 'Mr.', 'Bates', 'vastly', 'understating', 'case.Season', '2', 'also', 'notable', 'slow-rising', 'malaise', 'Bonneville', 'Lord', 'manor', 'inability', 'play', 'meaningful', 'role', 'war', 'obviously', 'eaten', 'general', 'disgust', 'senselessness', 'war', 'Matthew', 'injuries', 'have', 'brought', 'home', 'most', 'personal', 'manners', 'low', 'state', 'out', 'first', 'increased', 'irritation', 'wife', 'Cora', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'second', 'new', 'housemaid', 'Jane', 'Moorsum', 'said', 'immediately', 'uh-oh', 'Jane', 'backstory', 'husband', 'killed', 'war', 'saddled', 'young', 'son', 'raise', 'resonates', 'Crawley', 'lament', 'war', 'tragic', 'outcomes', 'piercing', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Clare', 'Calbraith', 'give', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'where', 'part', 'story', 'headed.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'Season', '2', 'couple', 'plotlines', 'seem', 'too', 'contrived', 'Matthew', 'probable', 'transected', 'spine', 'miracle', 'walker', 'full-out', 'full-powered', 'grappling', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'matter', 'couple', 'episodes', '[', 'notable', 'Making', 'featurette', 'Bonneville', 'joking', 'miracle', 'Stevens', 'wheelchair', 'assistance', 'Stevens', 'eyes', 'when', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'Julian', 'did', 'research', ']', 'series', 'threatened', 'go', 'totally', 'off', 'rails', 'almost', 'inexplicable', 'visit', 'house', 'wounded', 'disfigured', 'Canadian', 'solider', 'claiming', 'be', 'Mary', 'ex-fianc', 'eacute', 'thought', 'be', 'lost', 'Titanic', 'sinking', 'cause', 'claim', 'are', 'only', 'believed', 'often', 'overlooked', 'middle', 'sister', 'Edith', 'plot', 'quickly', 'discarded', 'hopefully', 'Fellowes', 'realized', 'ridiculousness', 'show', 'renowned', 'well-scripted', 'stories', 'one', 'was', 'clear', 'outlier', 'absurd', 'premise', 'presence', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'series.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', '3', 'especially', 'learning', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', ""'Grandmama"", 'Lady', 'Mary', 'aims', 'spend', 'time', 'coming', 'year', 'let', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'loud', 'probable', 'bombshell', 'play', 'out']",N/A

The first season begins in the early 1900s when class distinction was extremely engrained in British society. The lives of both servant and master are followed in this show, leading to multiple story lines and plot twists. As things progress, the characters endure the Great War. As a result, society begins to change. The beginnings of the middle class are hinted at. Sybil, one of the main characters, even marries outside of the aristocracy. It's interesting to see how the changes affect the servants--not always for the better. Jobs are lost, employment opportunities dwindle, etc. Then there's the great families: the lords and ladies who begin to lose their financial holdings. Chalked full of juicy drama, I would recommend this show to viewers who enjoy historical programing that is dramatic and engaging. The focus on period costumes, make up, and hair is wonderful. Spoiler alert: Season 3: I was a little frustrated with Season 3, due to the loss of a few key characters, but I'm still hooked, enjoying Season 4.

I could see shades of Fiddler On the Roof at times, but from a more non-religious aristocratic perspective.  I thoroughly love this series. The writing is superb.  The acting is flawless.  There is detail to the nth degree in the costumes, hairstyles, makeup etc.  And of course, the estate itself is fantastic and being an actual estate it really lends an air of versimilitude to the  series.  I also enjoy the fact the most of the cast interviews are done on the set and with everyone in full costume and makeup.

Downton Abbey has been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen and the action covers the period from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. As in the first series, topical events of the period, political, economic and military are covered.The wartime scenario and the convalescent home setting provide an excellent background for some interesting story lines. The combination of excellent plot lines, great acting and the superb setting display all that is best in TV period drama. This time round we have eight more episodes to add to the seven in the first series. As befits wartime, the costumes are not as flamboyant as in the first series but they are thoroughly researched and appropriate to the period.There continue to be many superb individual performances but mention must be made of Maggie Smith. What a stroke of genius to cast her as Violet. She dominates every scene she appears in and often has some very funny lines.The UK has a long tradition of producing fine period dramas and this is the most successful since the early 1980s whenBrideshead Revisited: 30th Anniversary Editiontook the world by storm.

For some reason it is sold separately from the Season 2 set in the UK but is included in the American PBS DVD/Blu-ray releases.The year is 1919, and the inhabitants of Downton Abbey are celebrating the first Christmas of peacetime, but the trial of Bates (Brendan Coyle) for the murder of his wife casts a shadow over the otherwise-bright festivities.  The Crawleys rally around Anna (Joanne Froggatt) but the outcome doesn't look promising.  Thomas (Rob James-Collier), back to being a regular old footman, once again wants Bates' job as Robert's (Hugh Bonneville) valet, but he is still regarded as untrustworthy for such an intimate position.Downstairs, Daisy (Sophie McShera) is still racked with guilt over her ""sham wedding"" to William and the frequent visits of William's lonely father.  She is also becoming increasingly frustrated with the limitations of her job and ponders leaving Downton to become a fully-fledged cook.Upstairs, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) is rapidly discovering what an absolute jackass Sir Richard Carlisle (Iain Glen) really is, during Downton's traditional Christmas activities, where he is by turns snobbish, jealous and outright rude towards members of the Crawley family.  Since Richard could potentially destroy Mary's reputation within a heartbeat, will she decide to marry him or risk it all for another chance with Matthew (Dan Stevens)?With the absence of Lady Sybil (now married and living in Ireland with Branson), there's room for another upstairs plot, which is taken by Robert's sister Lady Rosamund Painswick (Samantha Bond) - who is considering getting married once more, but whose suitor (Nigel Havers) seems to be more taken with her considerable fortune (and ladies' maid, played by Sharon Small).This special movie-length DOWNTON ABBEY episode features all the cast favourites (including the peerless Dame Maggie Smith dishing out more withering observations as Dowager Countess Violet) and most importantly sets the scene for Season Three, which, as of this review's writing, is about to start airing on ITV in the United Kingdom.",4,"festive fun and delicious drama in ""Downton""",1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,2174,"['CHRISTMAS', 'AT', 'DOWNTON', 'ABBEY', 'movie-length', '2011', 'finale', 'Season', 'Two', 'series', 'reason', 'sold', 'separately', 'Season', '2', 'set', 'UK', 'included', 'American', 'PBS', 'DVD/Blu-ray', 'releases.The', 'year', '1919', 'inhabitants', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'are', 'celebrating', 'first', 'Christmas', 'peacetime', 'trial', 'Bates', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'murder', 'wife', 'shadow', 'otherwise-bright', 'festivities', 'Crawleys', 'rally', 'Anna', 'Joanne', 'Froggatt', 'outcome', ""n't"", 'look', 'promising', 'Thomas', 'Rob', 'James-Collier', 'back', 'being', 'regular', 'old', 'footman', 'once', 'again', 'Bates', 'job', 'Robert', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'valet', 'still', 'regarded', 'untrustworthy', 'such', 'intimate', 'position.Downstairs', 'Daisy', 'Sophie', 'McShera', 'still', 'racked', 'guilt', 'sham', 'wedding', 'William', 'frequent', 'visits', 'William', 'lonely', 'father', 'also', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'limitations', 'job', 'ponders', 'leaving', 'Downton', 'become', 'fully-fledged', 'cook.Upstairs', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'rapidly', 'discovering', 'what', 'absolute', 'jackass', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Carlisle', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'really', 'Downton', 'traditional', 'Christmas', 'activities', 'where', 'turns', 'snobbish', 'jealous', 'outright', 'rude', 'towards', 'members', 'Crawley', 'family', 'Richard', 'could', 'potentially', 'destroy', 'Mary', 'reputation', 'heartbeat', 'will', 'decide', 'marry', 'risk', 'chance', 'Matthew', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'absence', 'Lady', 'Sybil', 'now', 'married', 'living', 'Ireland', 'Branson', 'room', 'upstairs', 'plot', 'taken', 'Robert', 'sister', 'Lady', 'Rosamund', 'Painswick', 'Samantha', 'Bond', 'who', 'considering', 'getting', 'married', 'once', 'more', 'suitor', 'Nigel', 'Havers', 'be', 'more', 'taken', 'considerable', 'fortune', 'ladies', 'maid', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Small', '.This', 'special', 'movie-length', 'DOWNTON', 'ABBEY', 'episode', 'cast', 'favourites', 'including', 'peerless', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'dishing', 'out', 'more', 'withering', 'observations', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'Violet', 'most', 'importantly', 'scene', 'Season', 'Three', 'review', 'writing', 'start', 'airing', 'ITV', 'United', 'Kingdom']",N/A

1421527,AB34G6VKP28L,B004NSUXHU,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[197, 215]","Considered one of the most successful ""darlings"" in the history of television, the first season of Downton Abbey achieved international success and a worldwide following. Its second season includes the same likable (and some not so likable) characters, but in an entirely new world...When last we left Downton, the house was in turmoil at the recent news that war has begun with Germany. Some time later, the inhabitants of the great old estate have seen their lives immensely changed. Robert (Hugh Bonneville) feels inadequate and wants greatly to once more go to battle rather than staying at home and raising the morale of the women, and his wife Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) is too distracted to take much notice of his melancholy mood. Each of his daughters have embarked on individual quests to be of some use: Mary (Michelle Dockery) is both pining and praying for her beloved Matthew (Dan Stevens) at the front, Edith (Laura Carmichael) is learning to drive a tractor (among other things), and Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay) is hoping to become a nurse at the local hospital.Downstairs, Carson (Jim Carter) is attempting to contend with a limited staff and even scarcer resources. Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan) is confronted with the antics and perils of a brand new maid with ideas above her station, and the would-be-romance between Anna (Joan Froggatt) and Bates (Brendan Coyle) is put on temporary hold when his wife (Maria Doyle Kennedy) arrives with a startling proposition.While each of the characters confronts their fears and struggles to find a way to fit into a world that is altering all around them, the second season powers forward with purpose and sentimentality... although it does sometimes stray into convenient clich&eacute;s and predictable outcomes. One of the more remarkable things about it is how this series manages to involve us so completely in the lives of its many protagonists, whether we love or hate them, find them irritating or are frustrated with their bad choices. This season finds a dramatic change in Lady Mary for the better, makes us feel sorry for Thomas (I never thought it possible!), and invokes tears of both joy and sorrow as each installment comes to a close. The writing is sometimes magnificent and sometimes subpar, its main problem in moving too quickly through situations (in some instances, I would have advocated slowing down) and not permitting the audience to really spend much time on some of the romantic relationships. It also on occasion suffers from ""telling"" rather than ""showing,"" which is a shame. Some moments are very, very good (such as an attempted assassination, the return of a missing soldier, and the final ten minutes of the finale) while others are downright cringe-worthy - Mrs. Bates in particular is too conveniently evil for my taste.Season two has taken a lot of heat from critics and audiences alike for its predictable storylines and rampant clich&eacute;s. Much of this criticism is deserved, since while some of the character development is believable (such as the transformations of Mary and Edith) other departures are completely unexpected and unlikely. The series hits all the right emotional notes but doesn't quite have the spark of its predecessor. Gone are all the wonderful conversations and moments that were used to build character and humor and forthright plot-driven exposition is in its place. Even so, there are some terrific one-liners from Maggie Smith and the happy ending to one couple's crisis is more than enough to redeem any of its mistakes.",4,"""War makes early risers of us all.""",1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,3550,"['Considered', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'darlings', 'history', 'television', 'first', 'season', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'achieved', 'international', 'success', 'worldwide', 'following', 'second', 'season', 'same', 'likable', 'not', 'so', 'likable', 'characters', 'entirely', 'new', 'world', 'When', 'last', 'left', 'Downton', 'house', 'was', 'turmoil', 'recent', 'news', 'war', 'begun', 'Germany', 'time', 'later', 'inhabitants', 'great', 'old', 'estate', 'have', 'seen', 'lives', 'immensely', 'changed', 'Robert', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'feels', 'inadequate', 'greatly', 'once', 'more', 'go', 'battle', 'rather', 'staying', 'home', 'raising', 'morale', 'women', 'wife', 'Cora', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'too', 'distracted', 'take', 'much', 'notice', 'melancholy', 'mood', 'daughters', 'have', 'embarked', 'individual', 'quests', 'be', 'use', 'Mary', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'pining', 'praying', 'beloved', 'Matthew', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'front', 'Edith', 'Laura', 'Carmichael', 'learning', 'drive', 'tractor', 'other', 'things', 'Sybil', 'Jessica', 'Brown', 'Findlay', 'hoping', 'become', 'nurse', 'local', 'hospital.Downstairs', 'Carson', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'attempting', 'contend', 'limited', 'staff', 'even', 'scarcer', 'resources', 'Mrs.', 'Hughes', 'Phyllis', 'Logan', 'confronted', 'antics', 'perils', 'brand', 'new', 'maid', 'ideas', 'station', 'would-be-romance', 'Anna', 'Joan', 'Froggatt', 'Bates', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'put', 'temporary', 'hold', 'when', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'startling', 'proposition.While', 'characters', 'confronts', 'fears', 'struggles', 'find', 'way', 'fit', 'world', 'altering', 'second', 'season', 'powers', 'forward', 'purpose', 'sentimentality', 'sometimes', 'stray', 'convenient', 'clich', 'eacute', 'predictable', 'outcomes', 'One', 'more', 'remarkable', 'things', 'how', 'series', 'involve', 'so', 'completely', 'lives', 'many', 'protagonists', 'love', 'hate', 'find', 'irritating', 'are', 'frustrated', 'bad', 'choices', 'season', 'dramatic', 'change', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'better', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Thomas', 'never', 'thought', 'possible', 'tears', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'installment', 'close', 'writing', 'sometimes', 'magnificent', 'sometimes', 'subpar', 'main', 'problem', 'moving', 'too', 'quickly', 'situations', 'instances', 'would', 'have', 'advocated', 'slowing', 'down', 'not', 'permitting', 'audience', 'really', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'also', 'occasion', 'suffers', 'telling', 'rather', 'showing', 'shame', 'moments', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'such', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'return', 'missing', 'soldier', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'finale', 'others', 'are', 'downright', 'cringe-worthy', 'Mrs.', 'Bates', 'particular', 'too', 'conveniently', 'evil', 'taste.Season', 'two', 'taken', 'lot', 'heat', 'critics', 'audiences', 'alike', 'predictable', 'storylines', 'rampant', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.', 'Much', 'criticism', 'deserved', 'character', 'development', 'believable', 'such', 'transformations', 'Mary', 'Edith', 'other', 'departures', 'are', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'unlikely', 'series', 'right', 'emotional', 'notes', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'spark', 'predecessor', 'Gone', 'are', 'wonderful', 'conversations', 'moments', 'were', 'used', 'build', 'character', 'humor', 'forthright', 'plot-driven', 'exposition', 'place', 'Even', 'so', 'are', 'terrific', 'one-liners', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'happy', 'ending', 'one', 'couple', 'crisis', 'more', 'enough', 'redeem', 'mistakes']",N/A

1421545,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B004NSUXHU,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[17, 18]","Season one of Downton Abbey set a very high bar. Despite others calling this a 'soap opera', I watched with an open mind and am glad I did. One of my partner's best friends lives in the UK and told us to check this out. I have to say that I was impressed almost instantly. The show is amazingly beautiful. The setting is perfect, the costumes accurate, and the acting superlative.This is not 'The Tudors' or some crap like that (no offense if you enjoy that program, but you probably won't like this program if you enjoy that one). This is stately, slow moving, and interesting social drama from 1910s and 1920s Britain high society. There are some 'plots' among the characters, but nothing too out of the ordinary. The crew did hire a historian to make sure that things were not getting too squirrely.What we see is the inner working of a large estate seen mainly from the servants' points of view. We do get to know the aristocratic family, mainly the eldest daughter and the Lord, but we also get a delightful amount of screen time from an amazing Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess.There are a lot of British subtleties here, and the first series deals with inheritance laws and such, so those not too familiar might be a little lost at first... but after the first episode that becomes the story in the background and the characters' relationships (friendships most often... very rarely romantic entanglements ensue - which was the norm back then) take center stage. There are a couple of servants who wish to 'move up' the ranks and they hatch some devious plots to discredit some of the more respected servants. The daughters all seem to have their own agenda and the eldest and middle daughter do connive against each other quite a lot with some pretty disastrous results.Season two continues the story, but we are focused less on the inheritance and more on the effects of World War One on the people living and working in Downton. The show delves deeper into individual character's backgrounds and we finally see Vera in this season, who does a good job of becoming an important antagonist.However, there is a little more melodrama and a bit of whining that gets old (looking at you Daisy!). The daughters are all well portrayed and they all seem to have matured in their own way. The eldest daughter was getting on my nerves a little bit in the first half of the first season, but in this season, her character is a delight to watch.There are more surprises in this season, more of those catchy TV series moments that big budget American studios like to throw in... but this doesn't really detract from the overall quality and wonderful acting in this season. Compared to season one it is not quite as good, but compared to dozens of other dramas on television, this is head and shoulders above the rest. And also, this is not BBC, this is Masterpiece Classics. Not BBC.Also of note, the clarity, even on the regular DVD version, is much better in this season. Even my DVD copy looks nearly HD. If I had known that, I would have sprung for the Blu-Ray. Oh well..No",5,"Perhaps not quite up to the bar of season one, but still great period drama!",1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,3077,"['Season', 'one', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'set', 'very', 'high', 'bar', 'others', 'calling', ""'soap"", 'opera', 'watched', 'open', 'mind', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'One', 'partner', 'best', 'friends', 'UK', 'told', 'check', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'almost', 'instantly', 'show', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'perfect', 'costumes', 'accurate', 'acting', 'superlative.This', 'not', ""'The"", 'Tudors', 'crap', 'offense', 'enjoy', 'program', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'program', 'enjoy', 'one', 'stately', 'slow', 'moving', 'interesting', 'social', 'drama', '1910s', '1920s', 'Britain', 'high', 'society', 'are', ""'plots"", 'characters', 'nothing', 'too', 'ordinary', 'crew', 'did', 'hire', 'historian', 'make', 'sure', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'getting', 'too', 'squirrely.What', 'see', 'inner', 'working', 'large', 'estate', 'seen', 'mainly', 'servants', 'points', 'view', 'do', 'get', 'know', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'mainly', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Lord', 'also', 'get', 'delightful', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'amazing', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Dowager', 'Countess.There', 'are', 'lot', 'British', 'subtleties', 'here', 'first', 'series', 'deals', 'inheritance', 'laws', 'such', 'so', 'not', 'too', 'familiar', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'lost', 'first', 'first', 'episode', 'story', 'background', 'characters', 'relationships', 'friendships', 'most', 'often', 'very', 'rarely', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'ensue', 'was', 'norm', 'back', 'then', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'are', 'couple', 'servants', 'who', 'wish', ""'move"", 'up', 'ranks', 'hatch', 'devious', 'plots', 'discredit', 'more', 'respected', 'servants', 'daughters', 'seem', 'have', 'own', 'agenda', 'eldest', 'middle', 'daughter', 'do', 'connive', 'other', 'quite', 'lot', 'pretty', 'disastrous', 'results.Season', 'two', 'story', 'are', 'focused', 'less', 'inheritance', 'more', 'effects', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'people', 'living', 'working', 'Downton', 'show', 'deeper', 'individual', 'character', 'backgrounds', 'finally', 'see', 'Vera', 'season', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'becoming', 'important', 'antagonist.However', 'little', 'more', 'melodrama', 'bit', 'whining', 'old', 'looking', 'Daisy', 'daughters', 'are', 'well', 'portrayed', 'seem', 'have', 'matured', 'own', 'way', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'was', 'getting', 'nerves', 'little', 'bit', 'first', 'half', 'first', 'season', 'season', 'character', 'delight', 'are', 'more', 'surprises', 'season', 'more', 'catchy', 'TV', 'series', 'moments', 'big', 'budget', 'American', 'studios', 'throw', ""n't"", 'really', 'detract', 'overall', 'quality', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'season', 'Compared', 'season', 'one', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'compared', 'dozens', 'other', 'dramas', 'television', 'head', 'shoulders', 'rest', 'also', 'not', 'BBC', 'Masterpiece', 'Classics', 'Not', 'BBC.Also', 'note', 'clarity', 'even', 'regular', 'DVD', 'version', 'much', 'better', 'season', 'Even', 'DVD', 'copy', 'nearly', 'HD', 'had', 'known', 'would', 'have', 'sprung', 'Blu-Ray', 'Oh', 'well..No']",N/A

Churchill, Gallipoli in 1914 or the war's outset? 2. Robert's aborted liason with a housemaid? No chemistry, completely out of character. No contribution to the development of character or to the plot. 3. No religion to speak of; in only a few of the episodes was there any invocation of religion and almost none of God. That's a reflection of modern sensibilities not those of period. 4. The cook's miraculous recovery from cataracts? not even corrective lenses. 5. Matthew's miraculous recovery...dancing without effort after he has just regained the use of his legs.  and, no scars. Wow.  6. Thomas' miraculous recovery; no impairment of the use of his left hand and, in a year or two, no scar.  and, no one questions his status as a wounded soldier discharged from active service at the front. 7. the frequent use of the contemporary locutions that were very improbable...one expects some character to say ""it is what it is""...or, ""comfortable in his own skin"" or some other modern idiocy. 8. and, poor John Bates. death sentence just commuted. but, if a viewer does not now suspect some catastrophe to slam Bates, he has not been following the rhythm of the character's life, easily borrowed from or inspired by Dickens. 9. Carson's willingness to leave Downton? Not possible...incredible. 10. the references to turkey are, perhaps, understandable as informal...but no educated person of noble birth would address a formal message to the Turkish ambassador at the ""Embassy of Turkey"" or ""Turkish Embassy"": there was no ""Turkey"" at that time. 11. Mary was, perhaps, raped by Kemal...and, then, she refers to him as her ""lover""? she had just met him...he forced himself upon her (though she seemed to have warmed to the project) and, it seems, he was stricken in flagrante delicto. one could hardly say that he was her ""lover."" btw: the evidence of the circumstances of Kemal's demise would been obvious to a physician or anyone else who examined the body.",4,"it's a quality English soap, but not more than that",1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,2098,"['just', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'were', 'engaging', 'let', 'not', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'consider', 'particular', 'order', '1', 'Churchill', 'Gallipoli', '1914', 'war', 'outset', '2', 'Robert', 'aborted', 'liason', 'housemaid', 'chemistry', 'completely', 'character', 'contribution', 'development', 'character', 'plot', '3', 'religion', 'speak', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'invocation', 'religion', 'almost', 'none', 'God', 'reflection', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'not', 'period', '4', 'cook', 'miraculous', 'recovery', 'cataracts', 'not', 'even', 'corrective', 'lenses', '5', 'Matthew', 'miraculous', 'recovery', 'dancing', 'effort', 'just', 'regained', 'use', 'legs', 'scars', 'Wow', '6', 'Thomas', 'miraculous', 'recovery', 'impairment', 'use', 'left', 'hand', 'year', 'two', 'scar', 'one', 'questions', 'status', 'wounded', 'soldier', 'discharged', 'active', 'service', 'front', '7.', 'frequent', 'use', 'contemporary', 'locutions', 'were', 'very', 'improbable', 'one', 'character', 'say', 'what', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'other', 'modern', 'idiocy', '8.', 'poor', 'John', 'Bates', 'death', 'sentence', 'just', 'commuted', 'viewer', 'not', 'now', 'suspect', 'catastrophe', 'slam', 'Bates', 'not', 'been', 'following', 'rhythm', 'character', 'life', 'easily', 'borrowed', 'inspired', 'Dickens', '9', 'Carson', 'willingness', 'leave', 'Downton', 'Not', 'possible', 'incredible', '10.', 'references', 'turkey', 'are', 'perhaps', 'understandable', 'informal', 'educated', 'person', 'noble', 'birth', 'would', 'address', 'formal', 'message', 'Turkish', 'ambassador', 'Embassy', 'Turkey', 'Turkish', 'Embassy', 'was', 'Turkey', 'time', '11', 'Mary', 'was', 'perhaps', 'raped', 'Kemal', 'then', 'lover', 'had', 'just', 'met', 'forced', 'seemed', 'have', 'warmed', 'project', 'was', 'stricken', 'flagrante', 'delicto', 'one', 'could', 'hardly', 'say', 'was', 'lover', 'btw', 'evidence', 'circumstances', 'Kemal', 'demise', 'would', 'been', 'obvious', 'physician', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'examined', 'body']",N/A

Because of this, I plowed through all three seasons over the course of approximately one month.  (Yep - binge viewing!)The interesting thing about this special, not unlike the rest of the series, is that the actors do a spectacular job getting the audience to believe that trivial social concerns are truly important.  You will find yourself believing that this, that, or the other social faux pas is just as scandalous as the characters consider them.  This episode is brilliantly acted with the &#34;immersion factor&#34; of a great reality show; except the acting is worthy of the Royal Shakespeare Company.  You end up feeling like your are a member of their family rather than a member of the audience.As an entertainment consumer, the only thing that concerns me is that this episode is already included in the Season 2 blu-ray collection.  I would recommend that you spend the extra $7 and get approximately 8 more episodes from the full Season 2 series.  The only reason that you should purchase this in addition to the entire Season 2 series would be for collector purposes or perhaps this is the only episode that you missed.Without issuing any spoiler warnings, this episode has a splendid ending that will make any Christmas Eve memorable.  This is a more than worthy purchase.  If you have never watched any of the series before, I would caution you that you will be hooked on this drama after only a few minutes of watching.

But as of January 8, 2012 Downton Abbey Season 2 began with two episodes back to back lasting two hours.  If you're wondering if Season 2 is up to the high standards of Season 1, then rest assured the cast remains the same, the gorgeous photography remains the same, the writing is still Julian Fellowes, and the extraordinary study of the class system in England at the beginning of the last century is intact.As we were informed in the last episode of Season 1, World War I has begun and this adds a new set of circumstances to the Abbey upstairs and downstairs.  There is considerable dialogue about the desire vs. the fear of going to war, and the British military strips many of the Abbey's dwellers for the greed of the war.  Footman Thomas goes off as a medic, is unable to endure the stress, gets himself shot by the enemy, and moves back to the neighboring hospital to Downton Abbey as a nurse.  There he cares for a blinded victim - and the results of that situation will likely surface later.  Lady Sybil continues her feminist beliefs and trains to be a nurse, Lady Edith has all but given up on finding a husband and so learns to drive  a tractor for the farmer whose life was saved in the last season, Lady Mary still struggles with her on again/off again desire for solicitor Matthew, Carson still rules the roost, Bates' distant wife appears and causes Bates to leave Downton much to Anna's displeasure and the disappointment of the entire staff and owners, and the entire first episode continues to be influenced by the steady performance of Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess!There are new people to add to the Abbey and the openings for interesting new plots are tweaked.

The entire series concludes in Dec of 1919--and already there is production for series 3, a continuation but in the 1920s. There are plenty of cast members back so it is advisable to watch the first prior to the second, but not mandatory for entertainment. 15 cast back for the entire 2nd series, 12 more back for specific/multiple episodes, and 3 new major characters added.You will be as enthralled as the true series of comparison, the amazing dramatization of Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition). Both are period perfection, a look at British life in the war years, some intense suspense and mystery mixed with bits of serenity and romance. It's the WWI years with all the good and the bad, but the acting and writing make it all seem good somehow, at least from an entertainment point of view.Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess, or Violet to her family and friends, is a show within a show. She is perfection. Watch her face, enjoy her lines and relish the delivery. ""Snobbery in splendor.""

1421743,A1SCJWCMQ3W3KK,B004NSUXHU,Irishgal,"[0, 0]","After the somewhat-surprising success of &#34;Downton Abbey's&#34; first season (at least in the US), the second year was highly anticipated worldwide. The delicate balance between the aristocratic family living at the Yorkshire estate and the family's servants was sure to come under fire in the light of changing world events, and with so much more at stake, this year was bound to be exciting.When we left season one, the first World War had just broken out. Season two picks up two years later, with the family's heir, Matthew Crawley, firmly in the middle of the Battle of the Somme. As Cousin Matthew is fighting in the trenches, the rest of the family (and most of the staff) are at home in England, trying to do their bit for the war effort, and, as the war continues to drag on, making some bold choices to help those in need. Though it's being fought hundreds of miles away, the war does not leave England untouched, and Downton Abbey is not left out of the fray.With World War I providing a dramatic background of the lives of the family and servants we have come to love, there were changes that had to be made in season two. While the first year was idyllic in how it looked at Edwardian times, that way of life has vanished and seems unlikely to return. The era of great houses may be coming to an end, and the world itself is being thrown into the future in a rather violent manner. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the daughters of the family - Ladies Mary, Edith and Sybil - adapt the quickest to this brave and modern world. Even Cora is eager to pitch in and become somewhat of a working woman, leaving the Earl himself at loose ends as to how he fits into this strange new world.Where the last season was about meeting the characters and coming to grips with their personal situations, this year is about change. The War has changed the world, and everyone on the estate - from the Earl himself to the kitchen maid - must change with it. We see as Downton opens its doors to convalescing officers, Sybil takes up nursing and learns of a potential suitor (who isn't quite suitable for the family), and Edith learns to drive. Downstairs, Carson must deal with an increasing shortage of staff, Mrs. Hughes finds herself mixed up in a housemaid's complicated love life, and William wants nothing more than to go to the front to fight for his country.Of course, there are many new characters introduced this year, from the delicate Lavinia Swire to the hard-nosed entrepreneur Richard Carlisle. There are new servants, new love interests, and new challenges. But with those around them dying, the house must grab onto happiness when it comes and brave the storm together.Yes, these are the episodes as they originally aired in the UK (without PBS's jarring cuts or few extra scenes), and there are several interesting featurettes, including love in the time of war, costuming, and a behind-the-scenes look at filming. Unlike the UK version of the DVDs, this features no deleted scenes or episode commentary, but otherwise, the two are alike in every way.Many fans have been critical of season two for some of its inconsistencies. Personally, I've always been a fan of the Great War period, so it is fascinating for me. Granted, there are some promising storylines that fail to go anywhere, and some threads don't quite fit in with the characters they're attached to. However, overall, I truly enjoy re-watching this season about as much as I love season one, and that's saying something.",5,Incredible,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,3493,"['somewhat-surprising', 'success', '34', 'Downton', 'Abbey', '34', 'first', 'season', 'least', 'US', 'second', 'year', 'was', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'worldwide', 'delicate', 'balance', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'living', 'Yorkshire', 'estate', 'family', 'servants', 'was', 'sure', 'come', 'fire', 'light', 'changing', 'world', 'events', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'stake', 'year', 'was', 'bound', 'be', 'exciting.When', 'left', 'season', 'one', 'first', 'World', 'War', 'had', 'just', 'broken', 'out', 'Season', 'two', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'family', 'heir', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'firmly', 'middle', 'Battle', 'Somme', 'Cousin', 'Matthew', 'fighting', 'trenches', 'rest', 'family', 'most', 'staff', 'are', 'home', 'England', 'trying', 'do', 'bit', 'war', 'effort', 'war', 'drag', 'making', 'bold', 'choices', 'help', 'need', 'being', 'fought', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'away', 'war', 'not', 'leave', 'England', 'untouched', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'not', 'left', 'fray.With', 'World', 'War', 'providing', 'dramatic', 'background', 'lives', 'family', 'servants', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'were', 'changes', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'season', 'two', 'first', 'year', 'was', 'idyllic', 'how', 'looked', 'Edwardian', 'times', 'way', 'life', 'vanished', 'unlikely', 'return', 'era', 'great', 'houses', 'may', 'be', 'coming', 'end', 'world', 'being', 'thrown', 'future', 'rather', 'violent', 'manner', 'Perhaps', 'unsurprisingly', 'daughters', 'family', 'Ladies', 'Mary', 'Edith', 'Sybil', 'quickest', 'brave', 'modern', 'world', 'Even', 'Cora', 'eager', 'pitch', 'become', 'somewhat', 'working', 'woman', 'leaving', 'Earl', 'loose', 'ends', 'how', 'strange', 'new', 'world.Where', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'meeting', 'characters', 'coming', 'grips', 'personal', 'situations', 'year', 'change', 'War', 'changed', 'world', 'everyone', 'estate', 'Earl', 'kitchen', 'maid', 'must', 'change', 'see', 'Downton', 'doors', 'convalescing', 'officers', 'Sybil', 'up', 'nursing', 'learns', 'potential', 'suitor', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'suitable', 'family', 'Edith', 'drive', 'Downstairs', 'Carson', 'must', 'deal', 'increasing', 'shortage', 'staff', 'Mrs.', 'Hughes', 'mixed', 'up', 'housemaid', 'complicated', 'love', 'life', 'William', 'nothing', 'more', 'go', 'front', 'fight', 'country.Of', 'course', 'are', 'many', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'year', 'delicate', 'Lavinia', 'Swire', 'hard-nosed', 'entrepreneur', 'Richard', 'Carlisle', 'are', 'new', 'servants', 'new', 'love', 'interests', 'new', 'challenges', 'dying', 'house', 'must', 'grab', 'happiness', 'when', 'brave', 'storm', 'together.Yes', 'are', 'episodes', 'originally', 'aired', 'UK', 'PBS', 'jarring', 'cuts', 'few', 'extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'several', 'interesting', 'featurettes', 'including', 'love', 'time', 'war', 'costuming', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'filming', 'UK', 'version', 'DVDs', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episode', 'commentary', 'otherwise', 'two', 'are', 'alike', 'way.Many', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'critical', 'season', 'two', 'inconsistencies', 'Personally', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Great', 'War', 'period', 'fascinating', 'Granted', 'are', 'promising', 'storylines', 'fail', 'go', 'anywhere', 'threads', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'characters', ""'re"", 'attached', 'However', 'overall', 'truly', 'enjoy', 're-watching', 'season', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'season', 'one', 'saying', 'something']",N/A

However, while the first season basically covereda year or two, the 2nd season begins at the start of WW I, 1914, and ends in early 1920. While the world goes through six years, our beloved characters seem to go through 2-3 years at most, and do not age at all!! Let us ponder the frustrated love between Matthew & Mary. Did this really stretch out for six years?! Was she planning to move to Haxby (Hacksby) with Mr. Pompous for a few years? Say it ain't so!And did Bates deal with his horrible harridan of a wife for six years while dating Anna? None of that makes sense. What would naturally progress is sped up this season, giving the show more of soap opera effect: Matthew is nearly dead, Matthew is paralyzed, Matthew can walk again, Matthew can dance with Mary.

In season two it seems the whole world is conspiring against Downton:  A World War has started, the heir apparent is about to marry someone who he's not related to by blood, an army of cripples invade the abbey, the second sister still cannot get hitched despite her most ardent desperate attempts, and most chilling of all the youngest daughter has fallen in love with a commoner.  Throughout all this, the countess dowager maintains her sarcasm (&#34;what's a weekend?&#34;), the patriarch Robert maintains his aloofness, and his wife Cora maintains her snarky smile -- the British aristocrats at their most unflappable.Two love relationships pivot and move &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; from its otherwise stale and stalled existence.  There's Matthew's courting of Mary, whom we are certain will marry because they're cousins, their names are alliterative, and because there's a picture of them marrying on the DVD cover.  Theirs is a gilded existence, and they can whine and whimper at that all they want but everything in the end will fall into place in their favor.And then there's the anguished love between the two servants downstairs -- John Bates and Anna.  It seems the two star-struck lovers can never catch a break, but throughout their trials and tribulations the two face them with resolve and majesty.  And so while the two's love for each other seems incredible and impossible it's also what makes Downton Abbey significant and meaningful.",4,"A Cosy Little Place, Far Away from the World",1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1587,"['season', 'one', '34', 'Downton', 'Abbey', '34', 'outsider', 'heir', 'apparent', 'Downton', 'enchanted', 'inhabitants', 'throw', 'hissy', 'fit', 'season', 'two', 'whole', 'world', 'conspiring', 'Downton', 'World', 'War', 'started', 'heir', 'apparent', 'marry', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'related', 'blood', 'army', 'cripples', 'invade', 'abbey', 'second', 'sister', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'hitched', 'most', 'ardent', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'most', 'chilling', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'fallen', 'love', 'commoner', 'countess', 'dowager', 'sarcasm', '34', 'what', 'weekend', '34', 'patriarch', 'Robert', 'aloofness', 'wife', 'Cora', 'snarky', 'smile', 'British', 'aristocrats', 'most', 'unflappable.Two', 'love', 'relationships', 'pivot', 'move', '34', 'Downton', 'Abbey', '34', 'otherwise', 'stale', 'stalled', 'existence', 'Matthew', 'courting', 'Mary', 'whom', 'are', 'certain', 'will', 'marry', ""'re"", 'cousins', 'names', 'are', 'alliterative', 'picture', 'marrying', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Theirs', 'gilded', 'existence', 'can', 'whine', 'whimper', 'want', 'everything', 'end', 'will', 'fall', 'place', 'favor.And', 'then', 'anguished', 'love', 'two', 'servants', 'downstairs', 'John', 'Bates', 'Anna', 'two', 'star-struck', 'lovers', 'can', 'never', 'catch', 'break', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'two', 'face', 'resolve', 'majesty', 'so', 'two', 'love', 'other', 'incredible', 'impossible', 'also', 'what', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'significant', 'meaningful']",N/A

First off, the quality of the Blu-ray disc is fantastic. The images are tack-sharp, the audio quality is brilliant, and the menus are simple and easy to navigate.Season Two finds Downton Abbey a couple of years later than it was when Season One ended. WWI is well underway, and the war not only impacts each character in some way, but also the estate itself. There are some interesting story lines around the use of the home during the war. And, there are obviously many interesting story lines around how the characters are affected by the war and the changing times. It is nice to watch some of the characters' personalities take on added dimensions - particularly the Crawley daughters.A couple of the plot elements of Season Two are a little more soap-opera than I generally like, but this series is so good, and the characters and stories are so intricate and escaping, that I can overlook those. They really don't take away from the overall story, but they might make you roll your eyes a bit. But there are also some deeper, darker, and far more mysterious twists that unfold in Season Two. Of particular interest (to me) was the continuation of the budding relationship between Mr. Bates and Anna... one that is a far cry from a fairy-tale. And of course, the evil pair of plotters are still at it - and doing even more harm than they did in Season One. They are the pair that you love to hate.I was very glad they included the Christmas special in this set. It really does belong with the rest of the season's episodes, and it helps to cheer the somber mood that the final few episodes leave you with. It also sets the stage for a great season three.The only real complaint I have about Season Two, is that it ends.

1421923,A1J7HI27AO6HWO,B004NSUXHU,Lightspring2000,"[52, 62]","I have viewed the C. Special a number of times now. I couldn't wait for its North American release, so I ordered it as a single disc from Amazon UK in December since I had already bought Series 2 from the UK back in November and it did not include the C. Special. (We have a region-free/code-free DVD player.) Personally, I think that series 1 & 2 and the C. Special are all fabulous in countless ways. Top quality entertainment all the way.My only complaint is that I wish Julian Fellows hadn't written the 'downstairs' characters playing with a Ouji board. The script would have been just fine without that in it. The family playing Charades was fine and certainly innocuous and Mary's turn was nice and light.Having said that, this ""C. Special"" is the very best. I am agreeing with the actors themselves in numerous interviews while they were in North America (for Awards season) and later after returning back home in the U.K. The casting director is to be congratulated. Each actor is just perfect in their respective roles. The actors playing Mrs Bates, Sir Richard Carlisle, O'Brien and Thomas respectively, certainly earned their pay cheques. YUCK! However, by the end of Series 2 we can see how O'Brien and Thomas' personalities have begun somewhat of a transformation as life teaches them lessons.(As we too learn lessons in real life that will challenge our own value systems, such as 'we will reap what we sow"" and allowing others to enter our comfort zone when there is a need. Mary is a case in point. When series 1 began we see her as a snobbish, self centered personality. Watching her helping and caring for Matthew's health and disabilities during the war is so beautiful.I applaud each and every one of the actors beginning of course with, the indomitable Dame Maggie Smith. (Youtube shows all of the actors behind the scenes getting ready for their parts, and great interviews with most of the actors. The real owners even guides us through many of the 126 room castle in which the series takes place.)I first saw Hugh Bonnevile inDaniel Derondarecommended by Amazon.com. I despised his character and felt that he got what he deserved in the end. What arrogance! What haughtiness! And a calloused abuser to boot! He played that part to the hilt opposite Romola Garai. If you have never seen it, do check it out here on Amazon. In The Cazalets,Masterpiece Theatre - The CazaletsHugh was excellent also. But here, in Downton Abbey as the handsome Lord Grantham, he is truly Exceptional!Michelle Dockery and Dan Stevens are very much 'in sync' with their characters. What a love story! Anyone who has ever found love and lost it due to immature errors in their youth will identify with the painful hurt and longing revealed in their eyes. Michelle and Dan say they have had a great time playing M&M; in this series.  They have great on-screen chemistry.It is definitely true that one must see this ""C.

Was definitely hooked by the second episode. Decided to view both Seasons 1 and 2 in order to catch up prior to Season 3 broadcast. Loved every episode and viewed them again. Really refreshing to note how extremely popular it is with today's audiences considering there is so much violent, inferior entertainment.This is such a Masterpiece. The acting is phenomenal! The writing is superlative. The story is provocative. Great acting, writing is top notch. The storylines are extremely compelling. Beautiful scenery, costumes are fabulous,wonderful characters, superb actors.Downton Abbey grabs your attention and never lets go. The characters have me so captivated I don't want it to end. Even the ones you love to hate. The family, the downstairs staff, guests, and relatives are thrilling! I laughed, I cried. Can't wait for more.There are far too many great performances to highlight them all. Beginning with Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern as Lord and Lady Grantham. He is such a kind, moral individual. Maggie Smith Countess of Grantham is curmudgeon perfection. Her battling with Penelope Wilton (Matthew's Mother) is purely delightful. Michelle Dockery, (Mary) as the eldest daughter, and Dan Stevens, (Matthew) as the new heir, carry much of the story and both are quite appealing. However, the relationship/romance between Brendan Coyle (Lord Grantham's Valet) and Joanne Froggatt (Head House Maid) is a special favorite of mine.There is a lot happening on this estate. Both upstairs and down. There is romance, cover-ups, villainy, manipulation, politics, and everything imaginable. Never a dull moment, thoroughly entertaining.Did not take me long to purchase both Seasons 1 and 2 (original edition). The Christmas episode was definitely included.

1421974,A29ZNOVQFNLIJD,B004NSUXHU,"Lyric ""natri""","[4, 5]","So much has already been said -- there are positive and negative reviews everywhere -- but my advice is -- sit back and enjoy the opportunity to enter a world we will never know -- upstairs or downstairs at a time when mechanized warfare hadn't yet arrived as it would with WWI.  The life of men and women rich or poor was very different back then -- the world was a full blown patriarchy and it was about to be blown away on the winds of war which brought social, political, economic, scientific  and every other kind of change to the lives of people everywhere.The scenery in and outside of the house is wonderful, the costumes are sublime, the story is a soap opera but then Dickens wrote soap operas that left you hanging until the next chapter appeared in the newspaper -- this is the same -- at times the plotting is clumsy and predictable, the language lacks poetry, but the people, their problems -- loves, hates, deaths, wants and needs etc are universal and we want to know how things work out for them.  I defy anyone to watch and arrive at the end of an episode and not ask ""what's next"" -- even if you suspect what's next -- the fun is in the watching.To all who've watched and enjoyed this series, I recommend the Masterpiece version of ""Brideshead Revisted"" which premiered 30 years ago, the gloriously entertaining ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" from the 1970's, and ""The Jewel in the Crown"" -- all of them are marvelous and if you want more of the same ""I,Claudius"" -- a true masterpiece from Masterpiece.",5,Enjoy the view,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,1520,"['So', 'much', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'are', 'positive', 'negative', 'reviews', 'everywhere', 'advice', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'opportunity', 'enter', 'world', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'downstairs', 'time', 'when', 'mechanized', 'warfare', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'arrived', 'would', 'WWI', 'life', 'men', 'women', 'rich', 'poor', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'back', 'then', 'world', 'was', 'full', 'blown', 'patriarchy', 'was', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'winds', 'war', 'brought', 'social', 'political', 'economic', 'scientific', 'other', 'kind', 'change', 'lives', 'people', 'everywhere.The', 'scenery', 'house', 'wonderful', 'costumes', 'are', 'sublime', 'story', 'soap', 'opera', 'then', 'Dickens', 'wrote', 'soap', 'operas', 'left', 'hanging', 'next', 'chapter', 'appeared', 'newspaper', 'same', 'times', 'plotting', 'clumsy', 'predictable', 'language', 'poetry', 'people', 'problems', 'loves', 'hates', 'deaths', 'etc', 'are', 'universal', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'defy', 'anyone', 'watch', 'arrive', 'end', 'episode', 'not', 'ask', 'what', 'next', 'even', 'suspect', 'what', 'next', 'fun', 'watching.To', 'who', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'recommend', 'Masterpiece', 'version', 'Brideshead', 'Revisted', 'premiered', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'gloriously', 'entertaining', 'Duchess', 'Duke', 'Street', '1970', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'are', 'marvelous', 'want', 'more', 'same', 'Claudius', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'Masterpiece']",N/A

1422071,A1XJ3UJEJEIV4I,B004NSUXHU,M. Sue,"[11, 11]","Well, what more can you say about Downton Abbey?  It's probably one of the best TV series in recent history, period.  After I watched the 2 seasons of Downton Abbey, there was a deep sense of withdrawal & emptiness - feelings I get after I read a great novel.  Many say that season 2 is more sudsy & melodramatic, but watching the 2 seasons back to back, I found them equally entertaining & satisfying.What makes Downton Abbey so great is the exquisite writing, acting, & costume/set design that blow almost everything else you watch on TV out of the water.  The story lines are compelling, the characters are fully realized and not just stock, & the actors who portray them are so finely nuanced.  It's a formula that can hook an audience, make them care about the upstanding downstairs characters like Anna & Bates, curse at the evil of O'Brien & Thomas, and pine for more to happen between Matthew & Mary.  Michelle Dockery, who plays Mary Crawley, is an unbelievable actress.  You can love or hate her character, but her every look and facial expression so subtly exposes Mary's emotions, that she is a big reason that people are mad about the Matthew/Mary story line.  And Maggie Smith as Countess Dowager - her delivery of lines is just impeccable & her character adds some levity to the show.I don't want to add spoilers but would just say that:  1)  The Sybil-Branson romance was deemed a little incredulous to some, & it did seem like Sybil overcame her feelings of ambiguity rather quickly....2)  There is one sex scene (or at least scene in bed with a couple) - but it's definitely not the couple you wanted to see!  3)  The return/appearance of mystery character P. Gordon seemed pointless - unless of course he makes a return in season 3.  4)  For people who love the Matthew/Mary arc, the Christmas episode will prove to be deeply satisfying.If you are watching Downton from the beginning, just take it slow & savor every episode.

1422129,A1KJDBIJNWMDX1,B004NSUXHU,Pam from Texas,"[0, 0]","This is such a good series. All of the characters are fleshed out and we get to see the servants' lives as they cater to the rich as well as their rich employers' lives. For the most part they are all good people with good morals but no show would be good without a couple of villains. Downton Abbey is almost a character in itself. It's a beautifu mansion that the Crawley family lives in and safeguards. When the two heirs are killed, the Crawley's  immediately start looking for the next in line to inherit. The young man in this coveted position is not a member of the aristocracy and it almost seems like too much for him to take in. His strong willed mother recognizes what a huge opportunity this is for her son and guides him as they travel to see the estate.Another thing I like about this series is how some of the characters grow. I've only seen the first two season so I still have a ways to go. In the beginning, I couldn't stand Mary. I thought she was a spoilt brat with no regard for anybody but herself. She treated one of her sisters horribly and ruined her chances for marriage a couple of times. I had no sympathy for Mary. Yet as the series progressed, I began to dislike her less. She shows she does have compassion and feelings. I'm still not a Mary fan but I can at least watch her scenes without gritting my teeth.There is such a difference in the two classes. The servants have very little chance for a life of their own. There is a couple who are my favorites on the program. The valet, Bates, who walks with a limp, is a wonderful man with so much kindness. His love interest on the show is one of the maids and she is his equal in this regard. I love their scenes and get upset when things go wrong for them. There are two other servants who like nothing better than to cause trouble for them or anybody else, for that matter.If you like English period pieces with World War I as a backdrop, you will love this program. I recommend it very highly. If you like constant action and shoot 'em ups with dirty language and graphic sex, this program won't interest you.

Considering the Brits saw this a good three months ahead of us, it is fair to say that if one wants to, it was as easy as a simple Google search to find out what happened in the halls of Downton Abbey during its sophomore season. More than just one scandal befalls the house of Crawley.The date is November 1916 and heir apparent to the Downton Abbey estate Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) is in the thick of the fighting in the British army. He has parted with Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) on less than pleasant terms, which is why everyone at the Crawley house is unnerved when he returns on leave with his fianc&eacute;e Lavinia (Zoe Boyle) in tow. Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonnville) is unhappy with his lot as a Colonel in name only and not on the battlefield. His American wife, Lady Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) has become occupied with turning their home into a convalescent home for soldiers who still need to get mentally stronger. This leads Lord Grantham to confide in the new housemaid (Clare Calbraith) whose own life is one of hardships and complications. Mary sets her sights on a powerful business man (Iain Glenn) who comes from new money which makes the Countess (Maggie Smith) unfriendly with her granddaughter's betrothed - and if Mary doesn't watch herself she may just hand the man the power to destroy her. Meanwhile, Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay) finds her purpose in nursing and Edith (Laura Charmichael) feels left behind and quite without purpose during a time when everyone should be doing their bit.Downstairs... Bates (Brendan Coyle) return from London and happy reunion with Anna (Joanne Froggatt) is cut short by the return of his greedy wife (Maria Doyle Kennedy). The new house maid Ethel (Amy Nuttall) finds herself in a world of disgrace and ruin after one too many bad choices - choices that force Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan) and Carson (Jim Carter) to find her replacement. And William (Thomas Howes) defines a true hero... while Thomas (Rob James-Collier) proves just what a true coward he is.With so much going on, one might wonder just how it could all be squeezed into and resolved in a mere 10 hours. Creator Julian Fellowes does a stupendous job of it, although true to any good seasonal production, not everything is resolved to the satisfaction of his audience. Certain characters are not given a neat ending and others are given the ending that fans have longed to see. What is so lovely about this series is its insignificant way of presenting families and the events that cause them sorrow and bring them joy. One such scene that this idea calls to mind is a moment when Robert receives joyful news and he walks down the halls gleefully calling out to his family as he leads a parade of women down the staircase. Or the dry-witted one-lines that Maggie Smith gets in as the starchy but fair matriarch of the family - she can say more with one look or one line than the rest of the equally talented cast can.Despite its tendency to disappoint fans with its clich&eacute;d writing, I found the follow-up series charming. To expect it to remain the same in a war-torn era is unrealistic. The characters are just as strong and if possible, the relationships are stronger yet; particularly within the Crawley family. Julian Fellowes wrote a beautiful relationship between father and daughters this season - Lord Grantham is such a softie when all is said and done as regards his girls and it is lovely. It might not be the ""same"" as series one but it is just as engrossing in different outlets. Besides if you do fall among those who found this slightly disappointing, I think the beautiful 2-hour Christmas special will forgive all.",5,Downton Abbey Navigates 'New Day' in War-torn England,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,3868,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'especially', 'who', 'keep', 'up', 'news', 'entertainment', 'world', 'who', 'NOT', 'heard', 'glorious', 'series', 'definition', 'perhaps', 'understatement', 'Considering', 'Brits', 'saw', 'good', 'three', 'months', 'ahead', 'fair', 'say', 'one', 'was', 'as', 'easy', 'simple', 'Google', 'search', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'halls', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'sophomore', 'season', 'More', 'just', 'one', 'scandal', 'house', 'Crawley.The', 'date', 'November', '1916', 'apparent', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'estate', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'thick', 'fighting', 'British', 'army', 'parted', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'less', 'pleasant', 'terms', 'why', 'everyone', 'Crawley', 'house', 'unnerved', 'when', 'leave', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Lavinia', 'Zoe', 'Boyle', 'tow', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'Hugh', 'Bonnville', 'unhappy', 'lot', 'Colonel', 'name', 'only', 'not', 'battlefield', 'American', 'wife', 'Lady', 'Cora', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'become', 'occupied', 'turning', 'home', 'convalescent', 'home', 'soldiers', 'who', 'still', 'need', 'get', 'mentally', 'stronger', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'confide', 'new', 'housemaid', 'Clare', 'Calbraith', 'own', 'life', 'one', 'hardships', 'complications', 'Mary', 'sights', 'powerful', 'business', 'man', 'Iain', 'Glenn', 'who', 'new', 'money', 'Countess', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'unfriendly', 'granddaughter', 'betrothed', 'Mary', ""n't"", 'watch', 'may', 'just', 'hand', 'man', 'power', 'destroy', 'Meanwhile', 'Sybil', 'Jessica', 'Brown-Findlay', 'purpose', 'nursing', 'Edith', 'Laura', 'Charmichael', 'left', 'quite', 'purpose', 'time', 'when', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'bit.Downstairs', 'Bates', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'return', 'London', 'happy', 'reunion', 'Anna', 'Joanne', 'Froggatt', 'cut', 'short', 'return', 'greedy', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'new', 'house', 'maid', 'Ethel', 'Amy', 'Nuttall', 'world', 'disgrace', 'ruin', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'choices', 'choices', 'force', 'Mrs.', 'Hughes', 'Phyllis', 'Logan', 'Carson', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'find', 'replacement', 'William', 'Thomas', 'Howes', 'true', 'hero', 'Thomas', 'Rob', 'James-Collier', 'just', 'what', 'true', 'coward', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'one', 'might', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'squeezed', 'resolved', 'mere', '10', 'hours', 'Creator', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'stupendous', 'job', 'true', 'good', 'seasonal', 'production', 'not', 'everything', 'resolved', 'satisfaction', 'audience', 'Certain', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'neat', 'ending', 'others', 'are', 'given', 'ending', 'fans', 'have', 'longed', 'see', 'What', 'so', 'lovely', 'series', 'insignificant', 'way', 'presenting', 'families', 'events', 'cause', 'sorrow', 'bring', 'joy', 'One', 'such', 'scene', 'idea', 'mind', 'moment', 'when', 'Robert', 'joyful', 'news', 'down', 'halls', 'gleefully', 'calling', 'out', 'family', 'parade', 'women', 'down', 'staircase', 'dry-witted', 'one-lines', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'starchy', 'fair', 'matriarch', 'family', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'one', 'look', 'one', 'line', 'rest', 'equally', 'talented', 'cast', 'can.Despite', 'tendency', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'writing', 'found', 'follow-up', 'series', 'charming', 'expect', 'remain', 'same', 'war-torn', 'era', 'unrealistic', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'strong', 'possible', 'relationships', 'are', 'stronger', 'yet', 'particularly', 'Crawley', 'family', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'wrote', 'beautiful', 'relationship', 'father', 'daughters', 'season', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'such', 'softie', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'regards', 'girls', 'lovely', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'series', 'one', 'just', 'engrossing', 'different', 'outlets', 'do', 'fall', 'who', 'found', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'think', 'beautiful', '2-hour', 'Christmas', 'special', 'will', 'forgive']",N/A

In Season 2, the time frame is from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 to the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1919. For those unfamiliar with the series, I would advise watching Season 1 first as it provides a lot of background information on many of the characters, as well as continuity.Change is a major theme this season - the Great War has wrought many changes to the residents of Downton Abbey. The Granthams, i.e. the Earl of Grantham (played by Hugh Bonneville); his wife, the American heiress, Cora, Countess Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern); their three adult daughters, beautiful Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), bitter Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), and idealistic Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay); and of course, The Dowager Countess Grantham, the Earl's mother played by the incomparable Dame Maggie Smith.The usually robust and confident Earl (I love Hugh Bonneville's portrayal of the benevolent Earl) feels somewhat out of place this season as he yearns to be of use to his country, yet all he gets is an honorary rank in the military, and is not considered for active duty due to his age. Mary is melancholic over her failed romance, Edith wants to master driving so that she can take over in case the family's chauffeur is called up to fight, and lovely Lady Sybil goes off to nursing school.The staff of Downton undergo changes of their own, and experience both ups and downs. Brendan Coyle who plays the Earl's faithful valet, John Bates, experiences some serious challenges when his estranged wife, Vera (Maria Kennedy) turns up. Tom Barrow (Rob James Collier), the footman, is away at war, but finds the experience unnerving to the point that he resorts to drastic measures to make his way home.There is good balance between scenes at the warfront and scenes at home. The battle scenes are credibly done, evoking all the fear and horror of the war. But I admit I was more interested in the machinations back home at Downton, and watching familiar and new characters resort to manipulation, scheming, and intrigues. There is a short, 10-minute segment prior to episode 1 which shows the setting for Downton Abbey, i.e. Highclere Castle in Hampshire, and includes interviews with the present owner as well as the director, producer, and cast members of the show.
