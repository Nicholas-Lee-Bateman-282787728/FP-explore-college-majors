The characters are cute, the songs are fun, and best of all, it's educational in such a way that we can laugh and play while working on his words.  Highly recommended!",5,How have I missed this??,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,255,"['son', 'just', 'turned', '3', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'together', 'characters', 'are', 'cute', 'songs', 'are', 'fun', 'best', 'educational', 'such', 'way', 'can', 'laugh', 'play', 'working', 'words', 'Highly', 'recommended']",WordWorld: Rocket to the Moon

It helps kids recognize their letters, sound out words, and spell, which I appreciate.  However, learning aside- this show is fantastic.  It is HILARIOUS, the characters are well-developed and lovable, and the quality is fantastic.I know this show is meant for preschoolers, but my 7 year old loves it too.  She is a beginning reader, and she feels very cool being able to recognize all the words in WordWorld. I am preordering both DVDs, and in the meantime we'll continue to catch it on PBS.",5,My kids and I LOVE this show!!,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,580,"['opinion', 'BEST', 'kids', 'show', 'come', 'around', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'kids', 'recognize', 'letters', 'sound', 'out', 'words', 'spell', 'appreciate', 'However', 'learning', 'aside-', 'show', 'fantastic', 'HILARIOUS', 'characters', 'are', 'well-developed', 'lovable', 'quality', 'fantastic.I', 'know', 'show', 'meant', 'preschoolers', '7', 'year', 'old', 'too', 'beginning', 'reader', 'very', 'cool', 'being', 'able', 'recognize', 'words', 'WordWorld', 'am', 'preordering', 'DVDs', 'meantime', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'catch', 'PBS']",WordWorld: Rocket to the Moon

It is visually appealing with lovable, non-annoying characters.  My son loves the stories and being able to pick out many of the letter.

Bonus! :0) Not sure if this is like other word world videos but they do have a lot of shows which if I'm not carefully to turn off or switch she'll zone out a bit. But overall these a great entertainment/ teaching devices.,5,Two for One,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,279,"['daughter', 'videos', 'are', 'educational', ':0', 'Not', 'sure', 'other', 'word', 'world', 'videos', 'do', 'have', 'lot', 'shows', ""'m"", 'not', 'carefully', 'turn', 'off', 'switch', ""'ll"", 'zone', 'out', 'bit', 'overall', 'great', 'entertainment/', 'teaching', 'devices']",WordWorld: Rocket to the Moon
1085153,A5S40MHKXE4Y6,B000S5NV62,"Tamara L. ""T""","[0, 0]","The ""Word World"" PBS serious is wonderful and quite educational.  My children ages 3 and 16 months really enjoy it.  My 16 month old son hardly puts two words together ever, but when I ask the children if they want to watch Word World, he responds ""Word World"".  He loves it. The characters in the series are fun and colorful.  The story lines are fun and educational.  Educational concepts are reinforced appropriately.Because of this series, my 3 year old daughter loves to ""build words"" with foam letters that we have.Another PBS series that is fabulous and entertaining is ""Super Why"".  Both my children can't get enough of it either.  I wish that the ""Super Why"" episodes would come to DVD also.  ""Super Why"" not only helps children spell words, but recognize letters and learn the alphabet.  The music they use is quite catchy too.The Leapfrog Educational DVD 5 pack is also are extremely educational.  I've reviewed them too.We view less than 2 hours of TV a day and ""Super Why"", ""Word World"" and the Leapfrog DVDs are a few of our limited viewing choices.Because of these shows, plus some home schooling, my 3 year-old reads at a Kindergarten level and my 16  month old son knows his beginning phonics, so I highly recommend all of the above.",5,A Great Educational Tool,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,1250,"['Word', 'World', 'PBS', 'serious', 'wonderful', 'quite', 'educational', 'children', '3', '16', 'months', 'really', 'enjoy', '16', 'month', 'old', 'son', 'hardly', 'two', 'words', 'together', 'ever', 'when', 'ask', 'children', 'want', 'watch', 'Word', 'World', 'Word', 'World', 'characters', 'series', 'are', 'fun', 'colorful', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'fun', 'educational', 'Educational', 'concepts', 'are', 'reinforced', 'series', '3', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'build', 'words', 'foam', 'letters', 'have.Another', 'PBS', 'series', 'fabulous', 'entertaining', 'Super', 'Why', 'children', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'wish', 'Super', 'Why', 'episodes', 'would', 'come', 'DVD', 'also', 'Super', 'Why', 'not', 'only', 'children', 'spell', 'words', 'recognize', 'letters', 'learn', 'alphabet', 'music', 'use', 'quite', 'catchy', 'too.The', 'Leapfrog', 'Educational', 'DVD', '5', 'pack', 'also', 'are', 'extremely', 'educational', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'too.We', 'view', 'less', '2', 'hours', 'TV', 'day', 'Super', 'Why', 'Word', 'World', 'Leapfrog', 'DVDs', 'are', 'few', 'limited', 'viewing', 'choices.Because', 'shows', 'home', 'schooling', '3', 'year-old', 'reads', 'Kindergarten', 'level', '16', 'month', 'old', 'son', 'beginning', 'phonics', 'highly', 'recommend', 'above']",WordWorld: Rocket to the Moon
