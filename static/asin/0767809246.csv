9036,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,0767809246,absent_minded_prof,"[2, 2]","You have to check this one out.  What a story!  Each of the four friends does at least some growing up on their journey -- okay, maybe not Vern so much, but they all do at least a little.  I don't want to merely recap what happens in the movie, you can find dozens of summations of the film on this page...  Corey Feldman should get more praise, I think, for his portrayal of Teddy.  Teddy is the wild kid in this film, whose dad was a military man who &quot;stormed the beach at Normandy&quot;, as we hear quite often in the movie.  Teddy really isn't intended to be the main character by any means, but as Kurt Vonnegut sometimes said, you really should pay attention to all the characters, because they're all human beings.  Otherwise stories, whether they are books or movies, can skew the way you look at the world, if you only care about the &quot;protagonist&quot; in some ongoing drama in your life.  Teddy is kind of a nutcase, but he seems to at least have dreams, and to try to have some integrity when it counts...  I thought he was a pretty good character.  Vern, played by Jerry O'Connell, is a good kid too, by his lights...  It is hilarious to see chubby, timid, Vern and realize that today Jerry O'Connell is probably the hottest actor of the four -- I'm not being fair to the late River Phoenix by saying that, but you see what I mean...  John Cusack, in one of his early appearances, is really warm and sympathetic here.  It makes you glad he's had such a terrific career.  Keifer Sutherland, not unusually for him in movies of this kind, plays the town jerk, a sort of charismatic hoodlum.  I guess this must have been a sort of reunion for him and Corey Feldman of their &quot;Lost Boys&quot; days, because they play very similar roles in each film, even to the extent of defining their characters through their conflicts with each other.  Wil Wheaton is the main character, and he is terrific.  He is very convincing as the introspective kid who wonders if being introspective makes him &quot;weird&quot;.  Also, I want to say that I really enjoyed the story he tells, of the pie eating contest.  Especially the way the actors play out the story -- it really looks like, and has the feel of, a gross-out revenge story being told by a twelve year old kid.  Just terrific.  When it comes right down to it, however, I agree with the basic gist of people's opinion here that River Phoenix stole the show with his character of Chris Chambers, the tough kid with a heart.  The film carries a nice message, too, in the way Chris is shown to find the ability to rise above his poor background and eventually make something of himself in life.Basically, you walk away from this movie feeling thoughtful, and pleasantly melancholy. I found myself full of warm memories of young friendships, and things that can only be shared between friends close enough to get down and dirty, cussing out each others mothers, and still hang out afterwards and share some Pez and root beer.

I have many tales now from when I was a child, but looking back none would have been able to hold a candle to this.--Going on a journey through the unknown, with your parent's believing you are somewhere else, to find the body of a young boy your age? Bliss.--Atleast at that age. Now, as an adult we must ignore our childlike instinct of exploration. How unfortunate for us.--While hiding under his front porch, digging for pennies that he had lost nine month's earlier, one of the boys named Vern overhears a conversation about a body. THE body. The body of a boy his own age that had mysteriously disappeared!--His feet can't move fast enough as he runs to tell his friends of what he had just heard. Facing everything in their lives, they gather their stuff and head off into the unknown. Perhaps it was Corey Feldman, but Stand by Me reminds me of Goonies without the skeletons and booby traps.--During the journey it is soon obvious that what they are after isn't the body, but an answer to mend the fragmented pieces of their past's. If you have had to deal with these problem's you will definately be able to relate.-(All of these four boys grew to be men in many films.

As such, there are many movies that can bring me to tears: E.T., Summer of `42, Casablanca...no matter what era they were released or who directed them, there will always be movies that will jerk some heart-felt tears out of this mostly action-adventure film watcher.Stand By Me, Rob Reiner's 1986 bittersweet coming of age story based on Stephen King's novella The Body, is definitely one of those movies that move me.Starring Wil Wheaton (Star Trek: The Next Generation), River Phoenix (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), Corey Feldman (The Lost Boys), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders, Joe's Apartment) and Kiefer Sutherland (24), Stand By Me tells how a group of four boys goes into the woods in search of the body of train-struck Ray Brower, hoping to recover it before a gang led by Ace (Sutherland at his meanest, menacing best) does.Reiner, working from a well-written screenplay by Raymond Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, excellently captures King's nostalgia-tinged story's mix of drama, comedy and even a bit of horror.  He coaxes very natural acting from his four main actors, particularly from Wheaton, Phoenix, and O'Connell.  Even Feldman, a child actor I really did not like in other films before his career flopped, is heartbreakingly poignant as Teddy Duchamp, the son of a mentally-ill World War II veteran.  Despite being scarred by his father's harsh punishments,  Teddy is proud of his father's wartime service.  One of the best scenes is his confrontation with the mean junkyard operator of Castle Rock, where Teddy's conflicting emotions of anger and love for his dad are summed up by his tearful yell of ""My father stormed the beach at Normandy!""The heart and soul of this movie comes from the friendship between Gordie Lachance (Wheaton), the sensitive would-be writer, and Chris Chambers (Phoenix), a bright kid who seems destined for disgrace because he comes from the wrong part of Castle Rock.  Chris projects a tough shell to hide his inner turmoil, while Gordie is having trouble coping with a family tragedy.Reiner shines as a director capable of mixing moments of comedy (watch for a hilarious exchange revolving around the mystery surrounding Goofy's identity -- ""Mickey's a mouse, Pluto is a dog...so what's Goofy?""), drama (an encounter with an approaching train), and a wickedly gross revenge story told by Gordie involving a very large boy and a pie-eating contest.A particularly effective narration by Richard Dreyfuss (who plays the adult Gordon Lachance) adds just the right mix of wry humor and bittersweet nostalgia, and Jack Nitzsche's gentle and subtle score, with its interpolation of the classic rock 'n' roll song ""Stand By Me"" just heightens the poignancy of this affecting tale of boyhood friendship.",5,Reiner's Classic Tale of Boyhood Friendship Shines,1062115200,"08 29, 2003",2003,2821,"['Okay', 'admit', 'Rick', 'Blaine', 'Casablanca', 'am', 'rank', 'sentimentalist', 'such', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'bring', 'tears', 'E.T.', 'Summer', '42', 'Casablanca', 'matter', 'what', 'were', 'released', 'who', 'directed', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'movies', 'will', 'jerk', 'heart-felt', 'tears', 'mostly', 'action-adventure', 'film', 'watcher.Stand', 'Me', 'Rob', 'Reiner', '1986', 'bittersweet', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'Body', 'definitely', 'one', 'movies', 'move', 'me.Starring', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Sliders', 'Joe', 'Apartment', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', '24', 'Stand', 'Me', 'how', 'group', 'four', 'boys', 'woods', 'search', 'body', 'train-struck', 'Ray', 'Brower', 'hoping', 'recover', 'gang', 'led', 'Ace', 'Sutherland', 'meanest', 'menacing', 'best', 'does.Reiner', 'working', 'well-written', 'screenplay', 'Raymond', 'Gideon', 'Bruce', 'A.', 'Evans', 'excellently', 'King', 'nostalgia-tinged', 'story', 'mix', 'drama', 'comedy', 'even', 'bit', 'horror', 'coaxes', 'very', 'natural', 'acting', 'four', 'main', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Wheaton', 'Phoenix', ""O'Connell"", 'Even', 'Feldman', 'child', 'actor', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'other', 'films', 'career', 'flopped', 'heartbreakingly', 'poignant', 'Teddy', 'Duchamp', 'son', 'mentally-ill', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'veteran', 'being', 'scarred', 'father', 'harsh', 'punishments', 'Teddy', 'proud', 'father', 'wartime', 'service', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'confrontation', 'mean', 'junkyard', 'operator', 'Castle', 'Rock', 'where', 'Teddy', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'anger', 'love', 'dad', 'are', 'summed', 'up', 'tearful', 'yell', 'father', 'stormed', 'beach', 'Normandy', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'friendship', 'Gordie', 'Lachance', 'Wheaton', 'sensitive', 'would-be', 'writer', 'Chris', 'Chambers', 'Phoenix', 'bright', 'kid', 'who', 'destined', 'disgrace', 'wrong', 'part', 'Castle', 'Rock', 'Chris', 'projects', 'tough', 'shell', 'hide', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'Gordie', 'having', 'trouble', 'coping', 'family', 'tragedy.Reiner', 'shines', 'director', 'capable', 'mixing', 'moments', 'comedy', 'watch', 'hilarious', 'exchange', 'revolving', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Goofy', 'identity', 'Mickey', 'mouse', 'Pluto', 'dog', 'so', 'what', 'Goofy', 'drama', 'encounter', 'approaching', 'train', 'wickedly', 'gross', 'revenge', 'story', 'told', 'Gordie', 'involving', 'very', 'large', 'boy', 'pie-eating', 'contest.A', 'particularly', 'effective', 'narration', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'adult', 'Gordon', 'Lachance', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'wry', 'humor', 'bittersweet', 'nostalgia', 'Jack', 'Nitzsche', 'gentle', 'subtle', 'score', 'interpolation', 'classic', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'song', 'Stand', 'Me', 'just', 'poignancy', 'affecting', 'tale', 'boyhood', 'friendship']",N/A

9048,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767809246,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","I expected something different from `Stand by Me'; that is, since it was written by Stephen King (the novella from which the film was adapted from was) I was expecting something thrilling or scary.  What I got was something completely opposite yet equally engaging.  Instead of a horror film or even a tense thriller, we are presented with a deeply moving story about friendship, relationships and boyhood.  `Stand by Me' is a beautifully told story of adolescence; of four boys who find that central part of themselves over a weekend trek through the woods.Gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern are on the brink of their teenage years.  Growing up in the 50's has not been too kind to them.  Their families are rocky as is their relationships with them.  Gordie, who narrates the story as an adult looking back at this chapter of his life, is conflicted at home.  His older brother has recently died, and his father is so wrecked over it that he casts Gordie aside as if he were unwanted.  Chris, Gordie's best friend, is treated horribly by the rest of the community because of his background (his father and brother are major trouble) and so he has become his own worst enemy because of it; downgrading himself and his own possibilities because of his conditioned mentality.  Teddy has suffered bizarre abuse from his father, who is now institutionalized; and Vern, well, he's got problems of his own (weight is always an issue).When a young boy their same age goes missing, and they get word that the body is down by the railroad tracks, the boys decide to trek out to find it and report the body.  What starts out as a few friends satisfying a morbid interest turns into a coming of age story that winds up completing these four young men in ways they never imagined.The movie is not perfect, but in parts it is grand.  Some of the acting is off, but there are some amazing performances that totally make up for the few inconsistencies; and while one major part of the film didn't sit right with me (the narration annoyed me) I can see its purpose; even if I wasn't a fan.The performances by the four young boys were all good, some great, some even superb.  Corey Feldman is an annoying celebrity (now that is) but when you separate his personal Hollywood existence from this performance you can see that he did a very good job.  He played the misunderstood kid, or in other words he played a normal kid, and he did it well.  Jerry O'Connell also does a fine job here at being a normal (albeit overweight) kid.  He's also an annoying celebrity now, but that's beside the point.  Wil Wheaton was less than impressive for me, especially since this was `his' movie and I never really felt compelled to watch him, except for in some of the final more crucial scenes.  He does a fine job in the end, but overall he was a little one-note.  Kiefer Sutherland delivers a memorable and engaging supporting performance as Ace, the town bully; but this movie belongs to the late River Phoenix who really deserved an Oscar nomination for his dynamic portrayal of the tortured Chris Chambers.  I was drawn to his every move, his every word, his every action and his character development was extraordinary.In the end I have to recommend this movie.  It could have been tightened in a few areas (I would have liked a little tension, and the removal of the narration would have been ideal) but the film is still a wonderfully fulfilling and rewarding journey through the tragedies as well as the blessings of adolescence.  Sprinkled with some wonderful performances and some poignant life lessons, `Stand by Me' is one of those touching buddy flicks you just can't help but adore.",4,A softer side of the King of horror...,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,3662,"['expected', 'something', 'different', 'Stand', 'Me', 'was', 'written', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'was', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'thrilling', 'scary', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'something', 'completely', 'opposite', 'yet', 'equally', 'engaging', 'Instead', 'horror', 'film', 'even', 'tense', 'thriller', 'are', 'presented', 'deeply', 'moving', 'story', 'friendship', 'relationships', 'boyhood', 'Stand', 'Me', 'beautifully', 'told', 'story', 'adolescence', 'four', 'boys', 'who', 'find', 'central', 'part', 'weekend', 'trek', 'woods.Gordie', 'Chris', 'Teddy', 'Vern', 'are', 'brink', 'teenage', 'years', 'Growing', 'up', '50', 'not', 'been', 'too', 'kind', 'families', 'are', 'rocky', 'relationships', 'Gordie', 'who', 'story', 'adult', 'looking', 'back', 'chapter', 'life', 'conflicted', 'home', 'older', 'brother', 'recently', 'died', 'father', 'so', 'wrecked', 'Gordie', 'aside', 'were', 'unwanted', 'Chris', 'Gordie', 'best', 'friend', 'treated', 'horribly', 'rest', 'community', 'background', 'father', 'brother', 'are', 'major', 'trouble', 'so', 'become', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'downgrading', 'own', 'possibilities', 'conditioned', 'mentality', 'Teddy', 'suffered', 'bizarre', 'abuse', 'father', 'who', 'now', 'institutionalized', 'Vern', 'well', 'got', 'problems', 'own', 'weight', 'always', 'issue', 'young', 'boy', 'same', 'age', 'missing', 'get', 'word', 'body', 'down', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'boys', 'decide', 'trek', 'out', 'find', 'report', 'body', 'What', 'out', 'few', 'friends', 'satisfying', 'morbid', 'interest', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'up', 'completing', 'four', 'young', 'men', 'ways', 'never', 'imagined.The', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'parts', 'grand', 'acting', 'are', 'amazing', 'performances', 'totally', 'make', 'up', 'few', 'inconsistencies', 'one', 'major', 'part', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'narration', 'can', 'see', 'purpose', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan.The', 'performances', 'four', 'young', 'boys', 'were', 'good', 'great', 'even', 'superb', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'annoying', 'celebrity', 'now', 'when', 'separate', 'personal', 'Hollywood', 'existence', 'performance', 'can', 'see', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'played', 'misunderstood', 'kid', 'other', 'words', 'played', 'normal', 'kid', 'did', 'well', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'here', 'being', 'normal', 'overweight', 'kid', 'also', 'annoying', 'celebrity', 'now', 'beside', 'point', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'was', 'less', 'impressive', 'especially', 'was', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'compelled', 'watch', 'final', 'more', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'fine', 'job', 'end', 'overall', 'was', 'little', 'one-note', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'memorable', 'engaging', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Ace', 'town', 'bully', 'movie', 'late', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'really', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'dynamic', 'portrayal', 'tortured', 'Chris', 'Chambers', 'was', 'drawn', 'move', 'word', 'action', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'end', 'have', 'recommend', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'few', 'areas', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'little', 'tension', 'removal', 'narration', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ideal', 'film', 'still', 'wonderfully', 'fulfilling', 'rewarding', 'journey', 'tragedies', 'as', 'well', 'blessings', 'adolescence', 'Sprinkled', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'poignant', 'life', 'lessons', 'Stand', 'Me', 'one', 'touching', 'buddy', 'flicks', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'adore']",N/A

However, this isn't the usual King/horror story. It's a magical journey back to youth and the fun adventures you'd have as a kid. Not to mention the bonds you develop with your closest childhood friends. The movie takes place in the 1950's where a group of friends decide to go on an overnight adventure to find the dead body of a boy who was hit and killed by a train. During their journey, the young lads have a few of their own scary encounters. The young guys are all played very realisticly by Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and the incredibly slimmed down Jerry 'O' Connell. Along the way, they encounter the town bully, played wonderfully by Kiefer Sutherland. The movie is narrarated by an adult Gordy(Wheaton's character), who is voiced, and played, by Richard Dreyfuss. I have always thought Dreyfuss had a great voice, and it is put to great use here. It's a special movie that will rekindle fond memories of your own childhood. Most people might not of gone on such a big and odd journey as these guys, but I'm sure almost anybody can relate to that special time in life. Reiner did a great job.

Anyone who has ever read &quot;The Body&quot; can tell you that this movie could not have been done better.  The story, while good, is mostly irrelevant.

I often wonder, had I never seen them as a youngster, how I would feel about certain films. I can say without question that this film would be as impactful now as it was when I viewed it through the eyes of innocence. The encapsulated childhood that Rob Reiner and Stephen King rendered in Stand By Me is almost unparalleled. Nearly every adult can view this film and completely relate to the content, the emotion, and the characters.Unlike The Goonies, Monster Squad, or any of the other great 80s kid adventures, this is a much more realistic, very adult story. Although it was an extremely popular theme throughout the 80s, this is not the 'lets get a group of kids together and let them have the ultimate kid adventure.' (again, ala goonies, space camp, the wizard, explorers, etc...) This film deals with the torments of youth; torn families, coming to terms with death, and, obviously, standing up for your fundamental beliefs even if you are clearly outmatched.The BD itself is quite wonderful. It has a marvelous picture-in-picture commentary with Rob, Wheaton, and Feldman. This isn't quite as spectacular as the Goonies picture-in-picture as the entire cast (obviously) could not be present. They share many, many memories from the set, their performances, some very poignant moments regarding River (you can see that his passing still affects them all very strongly), and even point out some very entertaining easter eggs and mistakes in the film.I couldn't recommend this film more for kids who are coming-of-age, or for adults who wish to shortly relive that time of misunderstood semi-adulthood.",5,Rob's proudest moment,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,1802,"['very', 'large', 'collection', 'blu', 'rays', 'possibly', 'too', 'large', 'given', 'format', 'will', 'be', 'gone', '4', '5', 'years', 'out', 'one', 'half', 'dozen', 'titles', 'defined', 'childhood', 'often', 'wonder', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'youngster', 'how', 'would', 'feel', 'certain', 'films', 'can', 'say', 'question', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'impactful', 'now', 'was', 'when', 'viewed', 'eyes', 'innocence', 'encapsulated', 'childhood', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Stephen', 'King', 'rendered', 'Stand', 'Me', 'almost', 'unparalleled', 'Nearly', 'adult', 'can', 'view', 'film', 'completely', 'relate', 'content', 'emotion', 'characters.Unlike', 'Goonies', 'Monster', 'Squad', 'other', 'great', '80s', 'kid', 'adventures', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'very', 'adult', 'story', 'was', 'extremely', 'popular', 'theme', '80s', 'not', ""'lets"", 'get', 'group', 'kids', 'together', 'let', 'have', 'ultimate', 'kid', 'adventure', 'again', 'ala', 'goonies', 'space', 'camp', 'wizard', 'explorers', 'etc', 'film', 'torments', 'youth', 'torn', 'families', 'coming', 'terms', 'death', 'obviously', 'standing', 'up', 'fundamental', 'beliefs', 'even', 'are', 'clearly', 'outmatched.The', 'BD', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'marvelous', 'picture-in-picture', 'commentary', 'Rob', 'Wheaton', 'Feldman', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'spectacular', 'Goonies', 'picture-in-picture', 'entire', 'cast', 'obviously', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'present', 'share', 'many', 'many', 'memories', 'set', 'performances', 'very', 'poignant', 'moments', 'regarding', 'River', 'can', 'see', 'passing', 'still', 'very', 'strongly', 'even', 'point', 'out', 'very', 'entertaining', 'easter', 'eggs', 'mistakes', 'film.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'more', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'coming-of-age', 'adults', 'who', 'wish', 'shortly', 'relive', 'time', 'misunderstood', 'semi-adulthood']",N/A

Luckily,  it is captured by Rob Reiner's excellent direction and the four boys' incredible acting.  The story,  based on a Stephen King short story,  revolves around Gordie(Wil Wheaton),  Chris(River Phoenix),  Teddy(Corey Feldman),  and Vern(Jerry O'Connell).  Having heard about the disappearance of Ray Brauer, they discover from Vern that his brother ran across the body,  but could not tell the police because he was in a stolen car.  Eager to claim fame,  the boys set off on a long trek to find the body and become famous.  Throughout this trip,  they learn more about themselves and each other than they could ever imagine.  Vern's brother tells the leader of his gang Ace the whereabouts of the body,  so they too set off for the body.  This comedy/drama is simply incredible.  I grew up watching this movie.  Wil Wheaton is brilliant as Gordie,  the would-be writer.  The late River Phoenix gives an unforgettable performance as Chris.  Corey Feldman plays the wild and crazy Teddy with great effect,  and Jerry O'Connell is hysterical as Vern.  Kiefer Sutherland is also excellent as Ace,  while John Cusack makes a good cameo performance as Gordie's deceased brother Denny.

Wolf,"[5, 6]","Setting & Theme(s): Castlerock, smallville, summer friends' adventure, life's lessons, solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown.This 1986 instant classic of Rob Reiner's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film.  The musical score is dramatic, it sets the tempo from start to finish, and it never misses a beat; each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie's unfolding, and you don't forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding.  The lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient, lazy summer days of grandeur, to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity.  One can in Stand By Me favorably assume to watch: pie eating contests, leeches, trains, train dodging, mail ball, fancy cars, fancy footwork (i.e. Verno's beloved comb's freefall), cantenes (thought they disappeared w/ Ben Franklin's outlets), junkyard dog chases, and much much more.  The ending is the real gravy.  The narration is superb also.By far one of the favorite films of my youth.  Believe John Cusack can be seen playing the role of Gordy's football star elder brother?  Stand By Me is the childhood that big city life just doesn't afford, at least not anymore.  Everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses; rustic destination spots, like the ones presented in this movie, are still out there folks.  With a smidgen of ambition toward adventure, which will take your there, the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated.

A slice of sentimentalism from the mid 80s spiced with adventurism and bawdy humor, a look back at an idyllic summer in the 1950s.  It IS these things, but it's much more.  It's the gold standard for the coming-of-age film and one of the most important movies ever made.Our lives are marked by climaxes including birth, puberty, marriage, and death.  These are romanticized, surrounded by ritual and sacrament because they're too real to see in the raw--as soiling by blood or sperm, as radical irrevocable change.  Pubertal transformation is particularly subject to lush romanticizing.  Puberty is a time of confusion, the intrusion of sex, identity in flux.  For boys, there's the added challenge of achieving manhood, a protean slippery status which is forever in question.And so, for this question, there is the quest.  Four boys walk railroad tracks in rural Oregon hoping for a glimpse of another boy their age who's been killed by a train. On the way, they tell gross-out stories, muse about the pop culture of the 50s (Mighty Mouse, Pez, Paladin), argue, fight, and make up.Pubertal boys create a treehouse culture, a separate world from the world of females and the world of adults.  It's full of boasts, smokes, and card games.  It's marked by looking for ways to test themselves in the big bad world.  So when Vern Tessio calls the quartet to adventure with the macabre question ""You guys wanna see a dead body?"" his peers are game.""Stand by Me"" moves a couple degrees from innocence to experience.  The idyllic 1950s move into the turbulent 60s.  The sweet-tempered 12-year-old becomes the surly adolescent.  Languorous summer tenses into autumn, smoky and chilled.  But not just yet! Mirages curdle as literate Gordie, leaderly Chris, and two lesser friends hum 50s classics and walk the tracks toward junior high and their inevitable separation.  This is the last golden summer before the fall.This is a movie of sunlight and leaves, of 12-year-old buddies and their nonchalant homoeroticism, of teary heart-to-hearts they will never have again as men, of incipient heterosexual awakening spurred by Annette Funicello's ..., of meeting Death (his sockets full of flies), of making jokes (the bawdier the better), of leaving town for the woods, of dangers from junkyard dogs, angry fathers, delinquent gangs, and leeches.This is the greatest gay film of all time, not ""Philadelphia"" or ""Parting Glances"" or ""Burnt Money.""  The tenderness between Gordie and Chris is so natural, so easy, because it occurs in a world not yet policed by the taboos of adult society and not yet hardened by requirements for macho display.  We get arms thrown around shoulders, hugs, and tears from these youths and we wonder if growing into manhood is an illness to be procrastinated.""I never had friends again like I did when I was 12.  ... does anyone?""",5,This Movie Isn't What It Seems To Be,1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,2874,"['What', 'seem', 'be', 'slice', 'sentimentalism', 'mid', '80s', 'spiced', 'adventurism', 'bawdy', 'humor', 'look', 'back', 'idyllic', 'summer', '1950s', 'things', 'much', 'more', 'gold', 'standard', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.Our', 'lives', 'are', 'marked', 'climaxes', 'including', 'birth', 'puberty', 'marriage', 'death', 'are', 'romanticized', 'surrounded', 'ritual', 'sacrament', ""'re"", 'too', 'real', 'see', 'raw', 'soiling', 'blood', 'sperm', 'radical', 'irrevocable', 'change', 'Pubertal', 'transformation', 'particularly', 'subject', 'lush', 'romanticizing', 'Puberty', 'time', 'confusion', 'intrusion', 'sex', 'identity', 'flux', 'boys', 'added', 'challenge', 'achieving', 'manhood', 'protean', 'slippery', 'status', 'forever', 'question.And', 'so', 'question', 'quest', 'Four', 'boys', 'walk', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'rural', 'Oregon', 'hoping', 'glimpse', 'boy', 'age', 'who', 'been', 'killed', 'train', 'way', 'tell', 'gross-out', 'stories', 'muse', 'pop', 'culture', '50s', 'Mighty', 'Mouse', 'Pez', 'Paladin', 'argue', 'fight', 'make', 'up.Pubertal', 'boys', 'create', 'treehouse', 'culture', 'separate', 'world', 'world', 'females', 'world', 'adults', 'full', 'boasts', 'smokes', 'card', 'games', 'marked', 'looking', 'ways', 'test', 'big', 'bad', 'world', 'So', 'when', 'Vern', 'Tessio', 'quartet', 'adventure', 'macabre', 'question', 'guys', 'wan', 'see', 'dead', 'body', 'peers', 'are', 'game', 'Stand', 'Me', 'couple', 'degrees', 'innocence', 'experience', 'idyllic', '1950s', 'move', 'turbulent', '60s', 'sweet-tempered', '12-year-old', 'surly', 'adolescent', 'Languorous', 'summer', 'tenses', 'autumn', 'smoky', 'chilled', 'not', 'just', 'yet', 'Mirages', 'curdle', 'literate', 'Gordie', 'leaderly', 'Chris', 'two', 'lesser', 'friends', 'hum', '50s', 'classics', 'walk', 'tracks', 'junior', 'high', 'inevitable', 'separation', 'last', 'golden', 'summer', 'fall.This', 'movie', 'sunlight', '12-year-old', 'buddies', 'nonchalant', 'homoeroticism', 'teary', 'heart-to-hearts', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'again', 'men', 'incipient', 'heterosexual', 'awakening', 'spurred', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'meeting', 'Death', 'sockets', 'full', 'flies', 'making', 'jokes', 'bawdier', 'better', 'leaving', 'town', 'woods', 'dangers', 'junkyard', 'dogs', 'angry', 'fathers', 'delinquent', 'gangs', 'leeches.This', 'greatest', 'gay', 'film', 'time', 'not', 'Philadelphia', 'Parting', 'Glances', 'Burnt', 'Money', 'tenderness', 'Gordie', 'Chris', 'so', 'natural', 'so', 'easy', 'world', 'not', 'yet', 'policed', 'taboos', 'adult', 'society', 'not', 'yet', 'hardened', 'requirements', 'macho', 'display', 'get', 'arms', 'thrown', 'shoulders', 'hugs', 'tears', 'youths', 'wonder', 'growing', 'manhood', 'illness', 'be', 'procrastinated', 'never', 'had', 'friends', 'again', 'did', 'when', 'was', '12', 'anyone']",N/A

Concerning itself with a quest undertaken by four boys moving through the gray zone between childhood and adolescence, all of them seeking to locate the body of a missing local boy whom they know to have been struck and killed by a passing train, Stand By Me, as with The Body before it, is actually so much more than its surface plot, and is nothing short of a coming of age masterpiece that examines loss, destiny, and the journey toward a deeper understanding of human life. This is one of those movies that captures the story on which it was based, learns from it, and becomes something great indeed.

Blood, death and fate are the constant subject of  conversation of these boys as if their adventure should be seen as a symbol  of the rites of passage from childhood into manhood that one still finds in  certain parts of the globe. It's clear that the dead boy our little heroes  want to find so badly represents their own childhood.

Wil Wheaton is great as Gordy, the sad doy eyed kid with a father who is about as sensitive as a brick wall and an imagination that could sell about as many stories as Stephen King. River Phoenix was stupendous as always, showing warmth and charm and such great talent. Corey was funny and disturbing, classic Feldman acting. Jerry O'Connell was priceless as the lovable Vern-o! &quot;I brought the comb!&quot; Plus we get the devishly wonderful Keifer Sutherland as the bully from hell. How could someone so hot be such an a-hole in every 80s movie?! But I love that guy, he adds the flavor to this movie. As an even added bonus we get two scenes with the always favorite John Cusask, as Gordy's deceased brother Denny. This movie has it all and I never tire of watching it. The DVD was quite awesome!

9096,AVCRD98TH48RN,0767809246,D. Knouse,"[4, 4]","4.5 stars.  This is easily one of my favorite films from my teenage years.  For many reasons, this film resonates with emotional nostalgia for any man who remembers their early pre-teen years, before the magic of youth began to fade with experience.  That's what this film captures: the magic of being a young boy.  It really doesn't matter that it's set in a different era, the nature of boys will always remain the same.  One of those universal traits came under critical fire when this movie was first released.  It had to do with the amount of profanity that all the main characters use.  I staunchly defended the dialogue, to this day for that matter, knowing full well that when boys are alone together they are more likely to rebel against talking conventionally.  Be it cursing or whatever, there is a sense of unbridled freedom when no authority figures are present to reprimand your behavior.  The four lead child actors here are all excellent.  Director Rob Reiner is, at least in this film, a genuine miracle worker.  It is a rare film that has this many child actors with this much talent and intelligence conveying what it's like to be a kid at heart.  At no time did I think they were acting beyond their years, like so many other child actors fall victim to doing.  There is plenty of wit and good old-fashioned toilet humor, which is the flavor of the day with young boys; but there are also some authentic, emotional moments in the story, as well.  This is a fine film that shines with great performances, charming direction from Rob Reiner, and a thoughtful story from the novella &quot;The Body&quot; by Stephen King.  One last note concerning this DVD: there is an especially poignant featurette on the making of this movie with a final ode to the late River Phoenix.  He was the James Dean of my generation, and he is greatly missed.  This film is just a small part of his short legacy, and provides ample proof that he would have been one of the greatest actors ever.

And solid up and coming young talents like Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix (RIP), Kiefer Sutherland, and Corey Feldman.  All key ingredients to make watching STAND BY ME an unforgettable viewing experience.A coming of age story set in 1950s rural Oregon, this film is the superbly crafted tale of four adolescents in search of a body allegedly decomposing in the woods.

Accordingly the story weaves, and weaves effortlessly, from lighthearted to poignant to disturbing--and back again.

9102,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,0767809246,Elisabeth,"[1, 1]","The moral of this story is don't judge a book by its cover, which is best exemplified by the secondary character Chris Chambers (played by River Phoenix).  From the start of his life, Chris was pegged to become a loser (given he had an alchoholic for a dad and a gangster for a brother), but turns out to be the most soulful character in the film.  Chris picks up where Gordie's caring older brother left off and becomes Gordie's savior in this film.The other misfits have a complexity to them as well.  You have the main character Gordie (Wil Wheaton) who believes his parents are correct in alternately treating him like a pest and an invisible child.  And there's also Teddy (Corey Feldman) who, for reasons unknown to all, defends his dad who nearly burned his ear off.  The only misfit who doesn't have any complexity to him is Vern (Jerry O'Connell), who's just there to provide comic relief.A few reviewers have complained about the foul language in this film, but it didn't bother me.  I saw it as kids just trying to sound cool, which kids do.  This story takes you back to the rules of childhood where cursing means you're cool, making fun of your friend's mother makes you even cooler, pinky swearing turns a promise into law, and skinning it turns an argument into a truce.That said, though, I also felt like these 12 year old boys possessed a maturity that didn't ring true.  It seemed unlikely for these boys to one minute wonder which superhero would win in a fight and then the next minute, engage in deep philosophical discussions.  There's one scene where Chris is having an existential crisis which seemed more fitting for a 25 year old to have than a 12 year old.Another confusing element to the film was why there were bullies in it.  Although the bully scenes were entertaining and well acted by Keifer Sutherland, these bullies didn't help serve the point of the story.Were they there to show the differences in wanting to see a dead body?  If that's the case, then the motive of Gordie's friends weren't any more pure than the bullies.Were they there to show how horrible these kid's childhood was?  I already got that sense by the description of Gordie's, Chris's, and Teddy's parents.If they were there merely for entertainment value, there was still a problem with that.  This story is narrated by an older Gordie, meaning what we see onscreen should only be what Gordie saw and heard.  But in this film, we see the bullies in places Gordie wasn't at, so how could he know what they were doing and saying?These problems were only minor, though, especially since I liked the showdown scene with the bullies.  The acting in this movie is superb, especially from River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton who show an unexpected maturity for their young ages.  The ending was good as well -- providing a punch to the gut that lingers afterwards.",5,Don't judge a book by it's cover,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,2856,"['moral', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'best', 'exemplified', 'secondary', 'character', 'Chris', 'Chambers', 'played', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'start', 'life', 'Chris', 'was', 'pegged', 'become', 'loser', 'given', 'had', 'alchoholic', 'dad', 'gangster', 'brother', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'soulful', 'character', 'film', 'Chris', 'up', 'where', 'Gordie', 'caring', 'older', 'brother', 'left', 'off', 'Gordie', 'savior', 'film.The', 'other', 'misfits', 'have', 'complexity', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'Gordie', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'who', 'parents', 'are', 'correct', 'alternately', 'treating', 'pest', 'invisible', 'child', 'also', 'Teddy', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'who', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'dad', 'who', 'nearly', 'burned', 'ear', 'only', 'misfit', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'complexity', 'Vern', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'who', 'just', 'there', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief.A', 'few', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'foul', 'language', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'saw', 'kids', 'just', 'trying', 'sound', 'cool', 'do', 'story', 'back', 'rules', 'childhood', 'where', 'cursing', ""'re"", 'cool', 'making', 'fun', 'friend', 'mother', 'even', 'cooler', 'pinky', 'swearing', 'promise', 'law', 'skinning', 'argument', 'truce.That', 'said', 'also', 'felt', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'possessed', 'maturity', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'seemed', 'unlikely', 'boys', 'one', 'minute', 'wonder', 'superhero', 'would', 'win', 'fight', 'then', 'next', 'minute', 'engage', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'discussions', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Chris', 'having', 'existential', 'crisis', 'seemed', 'more', 'fitting', '25', 'year', 'old', 'have', '12', 'year', 'old.Another', 'confusing', 'element', 'film', 'was', 'why', 'were', 'bullies', 'bully', 'scenes', 'were', 'entertaining', 'well', 'acted', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'bullies', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'serve', 'point', 'story.Were', 'there', 'show', 'differences', 'wanting', 'see', 'dead', 'body', 'case', 'then', 'motive', 'Gordie', 'friends', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'pure', 'bullies.Were', 'there', 'show', 'how', 'horrible', 'kid', 'childhood', 'was', 'already', 'got', 'sense', 'description', 'Gordie', 'Chris', 'Teddy', 'parents.If', 'were', 'there', 'merely', 'entertainment', 'value', 'was', 'still', 'problem', 'story', 'narrated', 'older', 'Gordie', 'meaning', 'what', 'see', 'onscreen', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'what', 'Gordie', 'saw', 'heard', 'film', 'see', 'bullies', 'places', 'Gordie', 'was', ""n't"", 'how', 'could', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'saying', 'problems', 'were', 'only', 'minor', 'though', 'especially', 'liked', 'showdown', 'scene', 'bullies', 'acting', 'movie', 'superb', 'especially', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'who', 'show', 'unexpected', 'maturity', 'young', 'ages', 'ending', 'was', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'punch', 'gut', 'afterwards']",N/A

One of my all time favorite Stephen King films is ""Stand By Me"". This movie really moved me that most films have never had. The late River Phoenix gave his best performance in this timeless classic. Based on the Stephen King short story ""The Body"", four young adolescent boys takes a weekend trip to check out a dead body. A young Wil Wheaton plays Gordie Lachance who is the narrator of this story. The young Gordie Lachance had recently lost his brother played by John Cusack (a brief but memorable cameo appearance) in the Vietnam war. Gordie is struggling to cope with his loss since his brother was the only person in his family who actually cared what Gordie did. Their parents literally ignored Gordie. The cast is rounded out by young Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, the late River Phoenix, and Kiefer Sutherland. So the boys decides to go on this trek to see this dead body but they aren't alone. Kiefer Sutherland and his gang decides to see this body and collect on the reward money. The funniest moment in the film is when Gordies tells the guys a story about some fat guy who enters a pie-eating contest. That was a laugh riot. I also laughed out loud when the guys are covered in leeches. ""Stand By Me"" remains a personal favorite movie of mine to this very day.

The powerful theme is the development of friendship during our formative years, those friendships that help form and shape our character.The story is about a group of twelve to thirteen year old boys. The main character is played by Wil Wheaton who is Gordie, a young man who recently became invisible to his parents over the death of an older brother, the favorite, a strong athlete, foot-ball player. We see him at home, trying to talk to his mother, who does not hear or see him for she is totally overcome with grief. His father also ignores him, making him feel that he is nothing as compared to the brother that recently died.River Phoenix, who plays Chris, is the young man that comes from a bad family, and as such, is expected to grow up to be nothing. In fact, he does not believe he can study, for who would want and support his efforts? At school, there is some money missing and everyone believes he took it, because, who else would do such a thing?Corey Feldman plays Teddy, the son of a violent alcoholic, who was near killed by his father in a fit of rage that made him put his son's head over the fire that almost burnt his ear off.The last character is played by Jerry O'Connell in the role of Vern, a kid who is scared of almost anything, but the one responsible for the adventure they are about to undertake, for he hears his older brothers tell the story of a body they found of a young man who has not been seen for days.They set out to find and observe the dead body of this other kid, killed by a passing train. The reason for their desire to be the first to find this body is to gain recognition, fame, and an opportunity to be in the news, both on radio and TV. So, they are willing to walk 25 to 30 miles, through swamps and open fields in morbid fascination with a corpse that lays out there.As they live through this adventure, they encounter danger, hunger, a ferocious dog with a fowled mouth, mean and vicious owner, a swamp where they encounter and get their bodies covered with leeches, and a near call as they try to cross a bridge... intended for trains... not people.But as we live the adventure with the main characters, we find that this movie is about the friendship of these boys, as they help one another grow and confront their personal daemons.As the story opens we find Richard Dreyfuss narrating the story as the adult version of the character played by Wheaton, who was the story teller of the group and grew to become a writer. During the movie, we have the rare opportunity to see very young versions of great actors of today, namely...

Once you start seeing this movie, you are quickly transported to your past (assuming you are now an adult), you begin to live your childhood through the characters, memories flood your psyche, and inevitably you are consumed with nostalgia.

Abadnoned by his parents, he is left to find the comfort in his friendships, with problem child Chris, troublesome Teddy, and innocent Vern.One of the many reasons why this movie still resonates with audiences is probably from the direction of Rob Reiner and its magnificent casting. Especially in that of the late River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton. At times when some movies fail to capture the experiences of youth, ""Stand By Me"" never fails, and even allows the music to do some of the talking. It creates a world that we all remember on a journey we all/will experience. It's one of the many reasons it still brings in new audiences every year.The Deluxe Eddition isn't bad. There is an eight song soundtrack that comes with the set, along with the booklet that tells of the making of the story. There is even a 40 minute video in the special feature section that is quite enjoyable. However, there aren't any trailers from the orginal release of the movie that seemed disapointng. The audio isn't bad and is even adapted for high defintion.""Stand By Me"" stands as one of Stephen King's finest writings. It will stay there for a long while, too. It's the perfect coming of age story where life is a journey of redemption and self-discovery.",4,"The Deluxe Eddition ain't bad, ****1/2",1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,1910,"['movie', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'old', 'hard', 'find', 'decent', 'story', 'days', 'deals', 'nostalgia', 'growing', 'up', 'Story', 'Body', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptation', 'film', 'Stand', 'Me', 'complete', 'classic', 'symbolization', 'youthful', 'truth', 'heartfelt', 'honesty', 'childhood', 'friendships', 'still', 'renders', 'hearts', 'viewer', 'Stand', 'Me', 'story', 'four', 'young', 'kids', 'unforgetable', 'journey', 'find', 'dead', 'body', 'young', 'teenage', 'boy', 'named', 'Ray', 'Brauer', 'experience', 'story', 'eyes', 'young', 'writer', 'Gordie', 'summer', '1959', 'world', 'shakened', 'horrible', 'news', 'brothers', 'passing', 'Abadnoned', 'parents', 'left', 'find', 'comfort', 'friendships', 'problem', 'child', 'Chris', 'troublesome', 'Teddy', 'innocent', 'Vern.One', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'still', 'audiences', 'probably', 'direction', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'magnificent', 'casting', 'Especially', 'late', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'times', 'when', 'movies', 'fail', 'capture', 'experiences', 'youth', 'Stand', 'Me', 'never', 'even', 'music', 'do', 'talking', 'world', 'remember', 'journey', 'all/will', 'experience', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'still', 'new', 'audiences', 'year.The', 'Deluxe', 'Eddition', ""n't"", 'bad', 'eight', 'song', 'soundtrack', 'set', 'booklet', 'making', 'story', 'even', '40', 'minute', 'video', 'special', 'feature', 'section', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'However', 'are', ""n't"", 'trailers', 'orginal', 'release', 'movie', 'seemed', 'disapointng', 'audio', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'adapted', 'high', 'defintion', 'Stand', 'Me', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'finest', 'writings', 'will', 'stay', 'there', 'long', 'while', 'too', 'perfect', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'where', 'life', 'journey', 'redemption', 'self-discovery']",N/A

9116,ARY6TY5V733ND,0767809246,"Hannah ""BookWorm""","[1, 1]","I only found out about this movie when my mum recommended it too me and I bought it at the begining of July. And all through the summer holidays I couldn't stop watching it.'Stand By Me' was based on the novella 'The Body' by Stephen King in the book collection 'Different Seasons'. And what is unusual about 'Stand by Me' is that Stephen King liked it, beause he doesn't often like adaptations of his work. But I don't see how anyone could not like this film.The story is set in the late 1950's and is about four boys who go on a two day journey in Oregon to find the body of a kid who recently went missing.  Along the way they discover about the world, that you have to stand up to it however hard that is, and only you can decide what you do with your future, and find their friendship, and it reaches out to one another when they are in trouble. And by the end of the movie they have all grown up in their own special way.The main stars are: Wil Wheaton, as the ignored-by-his-parents boy Gordon Lachance, Corey Feldman, is Teddy Duchamp whose father is a mad war hero and Jerry O'Connell (Screen debute) as the scared, fat kid Vern Tessio. But for me the best actor of the four was River Phoenix (RIP) who played the guy from a bad family with a good heart. He really shined as this chracter and his acting was truly amazing. And it is a real tragedy that he died so young.Other actors who starred were: Kiefer Sutherland, very good as the town bully. John Cusack, who had a couple of cameos as Gordie's deceased borther, and Richard Dreyfuss as the writer/ elder Gordie, he mostly narrated but his voice fit the movie perfectly.The direction of the movie by Rob Reiner was amazing, he had many scenes only done in one take, and this adds to the beauty of the movie. My favourite scene in the movie is the milk money scene and it is also Rob Reiner's as the acting from River Phoeix was beautiful and I'm sure I wasn't the only person who was crying during it, and most of the scene was taken from the book.The soundtrack to the movie was very beatuiful, with many songs from the 50's, but especially the theme song 'Stand By Me' by Ben E.King.The extras on the DVD were brilliant with interviews from the stars and director Rob Reiner and Stephen King. Also with a montage tribute to River Phoenix. Commentary by Rob Reiner, with little bits of extra information, filmography on the stars, trailers, isolated music score and production notes. But my favourite was the music video 'Stand by Me' in which River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton had cameos.This movie is very coming-of-age and a brillint film for any age, note to parents the only reaosn it has a high age rating is because of swearing, but don't let it put you off. It is a wonderful film, that deserves every bit of praise it gets.I recomend this movie to everyone, if you buy it I promise you, you won't be disappointed.",5,Best Movie Ever!!!,1061683200,"08 24, 2003",2003,2884,"['only', 'found', 'out', 'movie', 'when', 'mum', 'recommended', 'too', 'bought', 'begining', 'July', 'summer', 'holidays', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', ""'Stand"", 'Me', 'was', 'based', 'novella', 'Body', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'collection', ""'Different"", 'Seasons', 'what', 'unusual', ""'Stand"", 'Me', 'Stephen', 'King', 'liked', ""n't"", 'often', 'like', 'adaptations', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'not', 'like', 'film.The', 'story', 'set', 'late', '1950', 'four', 'boys', 'who', 'go', 'two', 'day', 'journey', 'Oregon', 'find', 'body', 'kid', 'who', 'recently', 'went', 'missing', 'way', 'discover', 'world', 'have', 'stand', 'up', 'however', 'hard', 'only', 'can', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'future', 'find', 'friendship', 'out', 'one', 'when', 'are', 'trouble', 'end', 'movie', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'own', 'special', 'way.The', 'main', 'stars', 'are', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'ignored-by-his-parents', 'boy', 'Gordon', 'Lachance', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Teddy', 'Duchamp', 'father', 'mad', 'war', 'hero', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Screen', 'debute', 'scared', 'fat', 'kid', 'Vern', 'Tessio', 'best', 'actor', 'four', 'was', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'RIP', 'who', 'played', 'guy', 'bad', 'family', 'good', 'heart', 'really', 'shined', 'chracter', 'acting', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing', 'real', 'tragedy', 'died', 'so', 'young.Other', 'actors', 'who', 'starred', 'were', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'very', 'good', 'town', 'bully', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', 'had', 'couple', 'cameos', 'Gordie', 'deceased', 'borther', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'writer/', 'elder', 'Gordie', 'mostly', 'narrated', 'voice', 'fit', 'movie', 'perfectly.The', 'direction', 'movie', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'was', 'amazing', 'had', 'many', 'scenes', 'only', 'done', 'one', 'take', 'beauty', 'movie', 'favourite', 'scene', 'movie', 'milk', 'money', 'scene', 'also', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'acting', 'River', 'Phoeix', 'was', 'beautiful', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'crying', 'most', 'scene', 'was', 'taken', 'book.The', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'beatuiful', 'many', 'songs', '50', 'especially', 'theme', 'song', ""'Stand"", 'Me', 'Ben', 'E.King.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'were', 'brilliant', 'interviews', 'stars', 'director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Also', 'montage', 'tribute', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Commentary', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'little', 'bits', 'extra', 'information', 'filmography', 'stars', 'trailers', 'isolated', 'music', 'score', 'production', 'notes', 'favourite', 'was', 'music', 'video', ""'Stand"", 'Me', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'had', 'cameos.This', 'movie', 'very', 'coming-of-age', 'brillint', 'film', 'age', 'note', 'parents', 'only', 'reaosn', 'high', 'age', 'rating', 'swearing', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'put', 'off', 'wonderful', 'film', 'bit', 'praise', 'recomend', 'movie', 'everyone', 'buy', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

Over the course of a day trekking over the hills and dales of Southwestern Oregon in the mid to late 1950's (and one memorable night spent around a campfire where a truly engaging and hilarious tale is spun by one of the boys) they seal the bonds of friendship.

The movie was based on the Stephen King novella ""The Body"" and directed by Rob Reiner, who also did King's ""Misery"" for the screen. This is a very faithful adaptation of a King story, and much of the dialogue came straight from the book.What makes this film really great is the interaction, chemistry and performances of the four young actors. Gordy LaChance is the college-bound writer/dreamer, played by Wil Wheaton (who went on to become Wesley Crusher in Star Trek: TNG) with some great facial expressions and moments of vulnerable emotion and inner strength. Chris Chambers is the rebellious bad boy, but smart and athletic, played by a very young River Phoenix (whose promising career was tragically cut short) with strength and wisdom beyond his years. Gordy and Chris are the characters who grow the most during the adventure. Gordy's older brother Dennis (played in cameo scenes by John Cusack) died earlier in the year, so he in going to view the body, he is unknowingly looking for some closure to that event. Chris is at a crossroads where he can either ""take shop and make birdhouses with the other retards"" or take the harder classes with Gordy.Teddy DuChamp is the psycho and dramatic kid, played by Corey Feldman, who had a productive child actor career. Teddy's relationship with the father who burned his ear on a hot stove is the key to his experience during a confrontation at the junkyard.Rounding out the group is Vern, the dim fat kid played by Jerry O'Connell, who of the four has changed considerably as an adult and continues to build a decent acting career.The film is very nostalgic, with its portrayal of small town life in the 1950s, treehouses, corner drug stores, and woods for exploring. Along the journey, there are a number of adventures, such as train dodges, a run-in with mean old Milo Pressman and his dog Chopper at the junkyard, a swamp full of leeches, and a night spent in the woods with howling coyotes. Interspersed with these sequences are moments of reflection and kids being kids, with weighty topics discussed like ""superman vs. mighty mouse"" and the importance of cherry flavored pez.The main outer conflict is with a group of high school age boys, led by a villain named Ace and played menacingly by Kiefer Sutherland. There are two key sequences involving Gordy and Chris and Ace, and to a lesser extent, Chris' older brother ""Eyeball"" Chambers.Funny and poignant, this is a great film about the brotherhood of boys, and was even referenced by Michael Gurian in his book ""The Wonder of Boys"" as a recommended film to watch with your young son to view positive examples of young male relationships.

Although I was 2 when this movie was out in theaters, I can imagine that the audience walked out quietly at the end of this film. Although one of my absolute favorite films of all time, I can only watch it occasionally as it stirs up many emotions about my childhood.This film also has incredible scenery of Oregon, an awesome soundtrack, and contains some of the most talented young actors.

Sixteen years later, the single thought that comes to mind in watching this movie is how absolutely timeless this movie is. Which is surprising, considering how important the late 1950's is crucial to the movie.The plot, a journey of four boyhood friends in search of their mortality, is simple and profoundly inspiring. How meaningful for these boys at the genesis of their lives, just learning some of life's most endearing and difficult lessons.  We travel along with them, learn along with them, all the while reflecting on our own long lost friends, and the so-important impact they had on our formative years. This movie celebrates what we once were, and brings us back, if only momentarily, to the time when life wasn't about mortgages or cars breaking down, but spending time with our friends, quite possibly, the people we adored more than our own family.The DVD is marvelous and well worth the price. A documentary shares many insights into making the film, and interviews the remaining boys ,with a touching tribute to the late River Phoenix, who's performance was critical to this movie. The music video was fun to see. However, I found Rob Reiner's commentary to be somewhat minimal. At one point he comments how many memories watching this movie stirs up, but he doesn't elaborate. I wanted to hear more, hear everything....Because this movie had so much personal impact, it's hard to know if it would effect others in the same way.

Based on Stephen King's story ""The Body,"" Stand By Me masterfully captures the essence of that critical period in life.Stand By Me tells the story of a group of boys about to grow up in more ways than one, carefree and looking at the end of summer for one last adventure as they set off on a hike and camping trip to find the body of a local boy gone missing.  About to enter Junior High and decide what they really want to do when they grow up, the boys must confront the end of their own youth by realizing the reality of death.Set in the 1950's, this film will not only resonate with baby boomers nostalgic for their own childhood but also with nearly anyone who can remember that turning point in their own lives.  Classic early rock hits like ""Lollipop"" and ""Mr. Sandman"" and campfire-side chats about Annette Funicello well-place the setting for even those born years later.Never in recent history has there been a group of young actors with such chemistry together on screen.  Wil Wheaton delivers a wonderful performance as a sensitive would-be writer who cannot live up to his tragically-killed football star brother's image; River Phoenix plays a tough kid from a bad family but with a good heart; and Corey Feldman acually shines in a film as the son of an abusive World War II vet.I cannot say more to recommend this film other than that it is one of my all-time favorites and certainly one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story (on par with The Shawshank Redemption).

Working with a cast of teen and preteen can not be the easiest thing to do and all indications are that he pulled it off with ease through incredible casting of child actors.Wil Wheaton is very impressive as Gordie, a boy who is ignored by his parents because he is different and must be challenged by his best friend, Chris.  Chris is played by River Phoenix and the acting job by River is unquestionably Oscar-worthy.  Few child performances are nearly as perfectly done as River's (others that come to mind are Mac Culkin in Home Alone and Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense), but I believe his stands above even those.  Keifer Sutherland plays the antagonist very well... the only misses in the cast may be a couple of the minor players in the older gang.  The younger gang of Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern is well written due to their many differences and the writer/director's (Stephen King/Rob Reiner) willingness to display a full range of emotions in all of them.

And yet every time I watch it I still enjoy it.  There is something about it I can't quite put my finger on.  Perhaps it reminds me of a time when life was more simple.  The film is about boys, boys at that age when they are discovering the world, and discovering the world with their friends.  Maybe it's the innocence of Stand By Me I love,  maybe it's the fact they swear a lot, or maybe it's the adventure, maybe it's that they all cry, or maybe it's that Vern can't remember the secret knock, whatever it is, it's masterful.  I love this movie.The story is beautifully simple.  It's 1950's small town USA (but it could be anywhere) and four boys discover they know the location of a missing kid their age.  They all lie to their parents so they can go find him.  The following day they set off down the railroad tracks to find him.  They think they will be heros, and they will, but not for the reasons they think.Perhaps I'm not really doing the plot justice by oversimplifying like that, but trust me, this is a great film. It may be the best film made about boys at this age.  To me it is the best.  The cast is superb.  When I watch this film I don't see performances, I see people.  Wil Wheaton is Gordie. River Phoenix is Chris.  Corey Feldman is Teddy.  In fact, even today when I see Jerry O'Connell in films I yell Vern.  You get the picture.  Also, I have to mention Keifer Sutherland, who is simply amazing as Ace, the teenage villian.  I am still afraid of him.  Richard Dreyfuss, despite few scenes, delivers a strong, subtle performance.  The film would be lost without his haunting narration.Rob Reiner is one of the best dierctors of the 80's.  I really believe it.  Between This is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride, and this film, he made three classics.  I think Stand By Me is his best work.  The performances he was able to elicit out of his young cast is phenomenal.  This is what a true director can do.  The scenic backdrop of Oregon also gives the picture a sort of harmony with nature that captures the tone perfectly.Stand By Me is a personal film.  Reiner and King have combined their boyhood expieriences to create a true vision of young men on the brink of manhood.

It is an exquisitely nostalgic and realistic story of four boys on the brink of puberty, barking on a quest to be heroes. In a way, it is a modern day Tom Sawyer adventure. Gordie, (Wil Wheaton), is the intelligent, creative one with the obviously bright future. His best buddy, Chris (River Phoenix), is the tough friend in order to hide the pain from the physical abuse he endures at home. He knows he is good inside, but deals with the hurt by the hard shell of rough talk and actions. The other two boys in the group are Vern (Jerry O'Connell), a pudgy tag-along, and Teddy (Corey Feldman), a loyal, funny but troubled kid with a death wish.When the four boys hear about a dead body 20 miles down the railroad tracks from their small Oregon town, they secretly set out to find the body and find out who it is. They have several setbacks and through it all, Gordie, Chris, Vern, and Teddy are such perfect characters and actors that it is hard to believe they are really acting. It reveals the simple life of children who know that soon there is a future that could tear them apart. They know time changes what the truth is and it will never be the same.The ""greaser"" gang of older boy teenagers also want to find the body - this adds to the competition and the pace of the movie. They want to find the body first and are surprised by Gordie's strong will and determination to have justice.""Stand by ME"" is a must see movie, no matter what your age.

However, having seen the video for 'Stand by Me' on the Vault, I was drawn to the movie for the entirely shallow reason that the song was good and it had clips of the film attached!Of course the problem, at this point, is that films which you expect to be good frequently disappoint. (You need only think ofThe Matrix ReloadedorStar Wars I - The Phantom Menaceto know that feeling...)Fortunately, this film DID live up to the long wait! It had all the wondrous writing of Stephen King, a non-cheesy, uplifting plot and sensational characters who were really engaging. It is plain, and easy to see why River Phoenix has the cult status he does, and also why this film is upheld as a seminal coming-of-age film.Of course, there are weaknesses, as the 2 star reviewer states. The weakness I'd highlight is Stephen King's incredibly annoying habit of putting himself in a story. Gordie would have been a far better character, if it weren't for his untouchable nature. This also means that he has the only part that has a happy ending (not to plot spoil), which is a little indulgent.However I would rate this film still, even with this minor weakness. And I would salute it for the fact that it avoids the cliche of many films of having a eponymous title song, which is then shamelessly used throughout (e.g. inAn Officer And A Gentleman). This film saves 'Stand by Me' (the song) for the titles at the end, and so quadruples its power (and makes you remember it for days after!)So, if you have this film at #3894 on your wishlist and are wondering whether it is worth seeing, then learn my lesson - it is and should be seen as a priority over all other films.

9163,A323VSV7A3AF25,0767809246,Manda,"[1, 1]","Best and most favorite movie of all time, hands down. I have seen it more than my brothers have seen Star Wars, This film means that much to me and was a huge part of my child hood (80s kid). The characters are all too realistic and relate-able for those from defunct homes.This film has taken on so much meaning for me throughout life and I have related to it on many levels throughout the years.These kids were going through some very tough and even adult issues. The isolation Gordy felt at home and the alienation his father cast on him, making Gordy feel as though it should have been him who died because he didn't amount to his brother in his father's eyes. Chris being misjudged by everyone, the resentment he had for being his brother's brother instead of being considered an individual, and wanting to be a peacemaker... he wanted more for himself but wasn't confident that he would ever overcome being &#34; just one of those low-life Chambers kids&#34;. I feel that was a huge bond for Chris and Gordy. They both felt compared to their brothers, and though Chris' brother wasn't dead, Chris still in a sense had &#34;lost&#34; his brother, being that Eyeball never had his back. Chris also had distance with his parents; the mother seems to have been absent and the father was an alcoholic. I feel Chris and Gordy really mirrored each other with their home life and connected on a deeper level separate from the other boys, and you see that deep connection in the woods when Chris cries, and then again at the end where Gordy is the one crying and Chris is the one comforting him. They have so many intimate moments where their bond shines, and they really did have a friendship beyond the realm of the group. Several scenes there are moments where they don't even have to say anything, they just look at each other with a knowing, and we all have a friend we've been able to do that with. You can almost communicate without speaking because you know what the other is thinking. That is something so intimate and powerful to have translate onto film. It came so naturally. There is a real deep and trusting love amongst brothers there.Chris had an old soul quality about him, which he clearly shows in his love for Gordy, saying he wished he was Gordy's dad so he could convince Gordy to aim higher, comforting Teddy when he broke down and became defensive of his abusive father, and keeping him from train dodging. I think Chris was trying to be the father to everyone else that he never had. Then there was Vern who got poked at and made fun of, just for being himself. His brother wasn't there for him either. He didn't get to have much of a voice, and probably felt invisible (much like Gordy, who felt invisible at home as well as &#34;weird&#34; for who he was) which has some irony to it, since he was teased for his size. Teddy was living with the reputation of his father pinned to him, and everyone knew his dirty laundry, which really paralleled Chris' situation. All of these kids were ghosts. Gordy and Chris ghosts of their brothers, Teddy of his father and Vern of himself. No wonder they were all so close. I find it to be relateable time and time again throughout the years with all of the heavy themes going on in this film.In the end, they all just wanted to be something, known for something great; something heroic.

And I was less than impressed.The story follows the journey of four boys - Vern, Teddy, Chris, and Gordie (Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Wil Wheaton) as they transition from boy to man.  Or at least teen.  The summer before they start Jr. High, a boy their own age goes missing.  When Vern hears where the boy's body is, they set out to find it so they can become heroes.  While they journey, all four face fears, hopes, and disappointments whether it's the absence of parental love, a future career as a writer, or things that go bump in the night.To be honest, I can understand why people like this movie.  It has a good mix of drama and comedy.  The acting is great.  The film is set in a small town in the 50's, so there's the nostalgia factor.So why didn't I like it?  First and foremost, the language.  That was the real biggie.  It was one thing when Ace (Kiefer Sutherland), the leader of the local gang swore.  It was something completely different to have these twelve year olds swearing all the time.  And frankly, I have a hard time imagining kids swearing that much during the 50's.  I'm probably way out in left field, but it doesn't right true.  There are several gross out moments I didn't care for.  Finally, the ending was depressing.  I'll grant you it was realistic.  But it was depressing.I know lots of people who grew up watching this film and absolutely love it.  As I said, I can see it why.  And maybe if I had seen it when I was younger, I would like it now.

But this is still a great movie.  It's about four 12-year-old boys who go on a 30-mile hike in search of a dead body.  The boys cuss, smoke, tell tall tales, and stick together as a team.  Let's just say that things get a little dicey, however, when the knife-wielding hoods of the town begin to follow the boys.

All in all, this is a wonderful movie.&quot;Stand By Me&quot;, however, is rated R.  In general terms, it is rated R for plenty of inappropriate, rude, and vulgar behavior.  These include crude language (e.g. &quot;Why don't you go home and .... your mother some more?!&quot;), smoking, offensive humor, and perilous situations, all of which involve 12-year-old kids.

I thought it brilliantly done, with supurb acting and direction.A group of boys, just coming up to adolescence, hear that another boy has been killed when walking along a rail track; they decide to go on the long hike together to discover the body. This trip leads to a test of loyalty between the boys, and acts as a sort of 'coming of age'. They learn a lot about each other, as they come into conflict with the demons within themselves and demons without, in the form of the teenage  hard guy Ace and his hangers on.It's based on the novella - called - appropriately enough - 'The Body'. This is one of the few none supernatural stories by Stephen King, who is a good writer in any genre. The film versio is very true to the original, which shows that it can be done.In a way there are two main characters,Gordon, the narrator, and Chris, who combines being a rebel with unususal wisdom for his age.They are both neglected at home; Gordon, the unwanted child of aging parents, was always passed over in comparison to his older brother; now that the brother is dead, his parents have become almost catonic, and it is fear that he will neglect his imaginative gift that leads Chris - young as he is - to play the part that Gordon's parents should, and urge him to keep on writing and making up stories.Chris, who comes from a family generally viewed as no good, is both compassionate and tough, but his whole air convinces bigoted adults that he is 'no good'. Typically, when the school milk money went missing, it was Chris who got the blame,  and not the teacher. He knows already how unfair life is.Teddy and Vern, lively but unthinking and dismissed as 'feebs' by Gordon's father, are already doomed to a life of small town failure.Set  in 'Castle Rock' a small town of the late 1950's, the slang, assumptions, and air of that era are casually demonstrated.Despite the fact that there are no strong female parts (an aspect of the story that always disappointed me) I still think it deserves five stars.

The performances given by the four young leads are remarkable and deserved of praise. River Phoenix's role as the charismatic leader of the prepubescent bunch is surprisingly mature and one that you would not expect from someone of his age bracket. Jerry O'Connell shines as Vern Tessio, the jolly and gullible fat kid. Plus, Feldman and Wheaton glow in their respective roles.The DVD is filled with great features. The documentary on the Summer of Stand By Me is informative and gives you greater insight into the making of the film from many different angles -- from the cameras, to the characters and to the action. The music video is great as well.I never seen this movie in its entirety until about a week ago, I always heard about the film from friends and from the media.

For an 85 minute long film, I was generally bored throughout. Except for occasionally thinking what a waste River Phoenix's death was. I disagree with other reviewers that this is the best adaptation of a Stephen King book - The Green Mile is infinitely better.Other reviewers have mentioned the whole coming of age thing - okay, so what? It's been done before, it'll be done again, and this will get lost. Reading all the five star reviews of this film, just seems not quite right. It's a so called 'classic', probably because it's River Phoenix, and he's now dead, sadly at only 23. But he's the only thing that kept me watching it.I just don't know, I bought this film for cheap, but I just wasn't fussed either way about it. River was definitely the best thing, and he surprised me how much older he looked, even though he was supposed to be playing a twelve year old. But it wasn't just his physical appearance, it was in his eyes as well, which kinda freaked me out.I wouldn't recommend this film, unless you're really into this coming of age stuff.

9185,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,0767809246,M. Oleson,"[3, 3]","This is a coming-of-age story about 4 best friends, all about 12 years old.  Set in Castle Rock, Oregon in 1959, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), Teddy (Corey Feldman, Chris (River Phoenix) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) set out on an adventure to find the body of a fellow classmate who had been reportedly killed by a train outside of town.  The idea itself seems a bit unusual, but what else was there to do in the small town.  In an era with no electronic entertainment other than radio and limited television, this was an adventure.Most of the film follows the boys on their journey of several miles by foot, following the train tracks.  It would include a hilarious overnight stay in the woods.  As the story progresses you can see each of the 4 characters personalities develop.  They are all different, but it is easy to predict what will come of them in adulthood.  Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace, who heads up a gang of older teenagers who are in competition to find the body as well.  It seems that the public notoriety of the find outweighs any consequences.  Sutherland looks just like the character he will play a year later in the vampire saga ""The Lost Boys"", also with Corey Feldman.Rob Reiner does a fine job directing all of these young actors, several of which have made some decent movies.  River Phoenix in particular shows the promise that was never quite realized in his short life.  The film while set in a different era, still resonates.  It is emotional and yes, sentimental but it works because of the honesty of the scenes.  It is never maudlin or foolish.  Seen in high definition the film gives some new justice to the Oregon landscape that ranges from distant snow capped mountains to a swamp-like forest.

9188,A2ZDEIO803CM2L,0767809246,Movie Lover,"[1, 1]","The movie ""Stand By Me"" was a film based off the novel by Stephen King known as ""The Body."" But for all who have seen it, you may notice it doesn't seem like the Stephen King type, I mean compare it to ""The Shining"" or ""It,"" this is a family flick with an R rating. I mean don't get me wrong, it's got a lot of adult content throughout the film like Chris (River Phoenix) swiping a loaded gun from his wasted dad, Ace (Kiefer Sutherland) almost stabbing Chris in the throat, Gordie (Wil Wheaton) threating to shoot Ace with the gun, the kids smoking, most of the characters constantly muttering bad swears, you know the rest. The part that most of the viewers out there including I, made us pee our pants was the train scene which Teddy (Corey Feldman) declares ""the all-time train dodge."" Aw, Speaking of Teddy I love that little guy! He's not afraid of nothin', he wasn't afraid to cross an old 100 foot bridge, he wasn't afraid to dodge an on-coming train, and he almost joined the army, what an awesome dude. And Vern (Jerry O' Connell) a little chubby kid who is afraid of everything, unlike Teddy. If you must know the plot it's about 4 12 year olds who set out to find a dead body and bring it back and become heroes. The emotional scenes make you realize that they have horrible lives in a small town, and by the end, you feel glad that they get out of their town. And if I could add a new scene it would be the boys encounter a vicious animal like a wolverine or a coyote and the grab the gun and blow it away. Oh well the rest of the movie was very entertaining!

My favorite movie of all time, The Shawshank Redemption, was made from the story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. It is the only movie ever made from a piece of King's fiction that transcends and is greater than the written original.Stand By Me was the first of the three movies to be made (the other being Apt Pupil). It is a great coming of age movie in its own right. Featuring a first-class cast of child actors (oh, the wasted potential now seen in their later years breaks the heart!), this movie may not transcend the story, but it certainly delivers the goods in a way that few movies made from King's works have done (The Green Mile springs to mind, but after it, Apt Pupil, and Shawshank, the drop-off is considerable).C.S. Lewis often spoke of Sensucht: the painful longing that itself is a joy. This movie, with its warts and all retelling a journey in the golden-hued past, powerfully evokes a feeling of sensucht. This feeling is eerily matched and accentuated while watching a young River Phoenix turn in one of his most powerful performances.I can't help but wonder if the fourth story of Different Seasons--The Breathing Method--will ever be made into a film. Its ending may ward off the faint of heart, but anyone who has ever heard the audio recording by Frank Muller could easily see its possibilities as a movie.I give Stand By Me my heartfelt recommendation.",4,STILL WAITING FOR THE BREATHING METHOD...,1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,1512,"['Stand', 'Me', 'was', 'first', 'three', 'great', 'movies', 'made', 'Stephen', 'King', 'collection', 'four', 'novellas', 'Different', 'Seasons', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'was', 'made', 'story', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'only', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'piece', 'King', 'fiction', 'transcends', 'greater', 'written', 'original.Stand', 'Me', 'was', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'be', 'made', 'other', 'being', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'great', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'Featuring', 'first-class', 'cast', 'child', 'actors', 'oh', 'wasted', 'potential', 'now', 'seen', 'later', 'years', 'heart', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'transcend', 'story', 'certainly', 'goods', 'way', 'few', 'movies', 'made', 'King', 'works', 'have', 'done', 'Green', 'Mile', 'springs', 'mind', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'Shawshank', 'drop-off', 'considerable', '.C.S', 'Lewis', 'often', 'spoke', 'Sensucht', 'painful', 'longing', 'joy', 'movie', 'warts', 'retelling', 'journey', 'golden-hued', 'past', 'powerfully', 'feeling', 'sensucht', 'feeling', 'eerily', 'matched', 'accentuated', 'watching', 'young', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'turn', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'performances.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'fourth', 'story', 'Different', 'Seasons', 'Breathing', 'Method', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'ending', 'may', 'ward', 'off', 'faint', 'heart', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'heard', 'audio', 'recording', 'Frank', 'Muller', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'possibilities', 'movie.I', 'give', 'Stand', 'Me', 'heartfelt', 'recommendation']",N/A

I really hadn't an idea of what the film might have instore for me, but it had left a good impression.  As the movie rolled on, I found myself completely involved with the world of our protagonists, and caught up in every vowel spoken and every movement made.  It's very rare that I find a movie so captivating, so entertaining, and so emotional.  However, ""Stand by Me"" was one of the few films that I found very very few flaws with.  The dialogue was easy to follow, the atmosphere was perfectly corresponding with the scenes, and the story was amazing.  The film is about four twelve-year-old boys, like any other twelve-year-old boys in 1959, who engage on a journey they'll never forget.  As the innocent, lighthearted ""fat kid"" Vern was looking for a lost jar of pennies under his porch, he overhears his older brother talking about a kid they found who died three days earlier.  In search of stardom and becoming home-town heroes they leave home and follow the railroad tracks to where the body supposedly lies.  Along the way, they face what's been eating away at each of them individually and have an emotional experience that is deeply profound to the characters.  The boys face the end of their childhood by the end of the story, and come back to their town completely changed.

This movie made laugh, think and at times, even want to cry. I read the novella long after seeing/and owning the movie. I happen to enjoy both though, despite some differences, some small others, larger. This was my first Stephen King movie I watched that didn't have a negative effect on me. But like every movie, there are parts I don't like. Kiefer Sutherland's first apperance indicates almost instantly that you're going to hate him, and he doesn't disappoint, you hate him more as the movie continues, but in the end, he gets a subtle taste of his own medicine. Now, I know in the 50s-70s, and in some ways, even now, we tolerate a lot more than we should have to, but when it comes to bullying, how many more suicides and Columbine massacres have to happen before everyone puts their foot down? As you can hopefully see, my compassion for bullies, rapists, and child molesters is rather slim, esp. when they show no remorse or mercy for their victims. I like this film because of several things, one: the young and somewhat unknown cast. 2: it has many fairly amusing scenes, 3: the music is so much better than some of the modern junk we hear now. 4: the scene where Wil Wheaton as Gordie stands up to Kiefer near the end, made me laugh and applaud. He does this scene with such determination, not to mention, intensity and the look on his face, gave me chills, almost wanting to look away, but couldn't.Then he says something to Kiefer, that I won't repeat due to being too vulgar, but it cracked me up to no end, and still does today. One of Gordie's stories, in the book, was something I wouldn't have expected from the mind of a 12 year old boy, at least in that time frame, these days, it wouldn't shock many.",4,"Stephen King, Rob Reiner style.",1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,1808,"[""'ve"", 'wanted', 'review', 'film', 'was', '15', '32', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'wait', 'movie', 'made', 'laugh', 'think', 'times', 'even', 'want', 'cry', 'read', 'novella', 'long', 'seeing/and', 'owning', 'movie', 'happen', 'enjoy', 'differences', 'small', 'others', 'larger', 'was', 'first', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movie', 'watched', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'negative', 'effect', 'movie', 'are', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'first', 'apperance', 'almost', 'instantly', ""'re"", 'going', 'hate', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'hate', 'more', 'movie', 'end', 'subtle', 'taste', 'own', 'medicine', 'Now', 'know', '50s-70s', 'ways', 'even', 'now', 'tolerate', 'lot', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'when', 'bullying', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'suicides', 'Columbine', 'massacres', 'have', 'happen', 'everyone', 'foot', 'down', 'can', 'hopefully', 'see', 'compassion', 'bullies', 'rapists', 'child', 'molesters', 'rather', 'slim', 'esp', 'when', 'show', 'remorse', 'mercy', 'victims', 'film', 'several', 'things', 'one', 'young', 'somewhat', 'unknown', 'cast', '2', 'many', 'fairly', 'amusing', 'scenes', '3', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'modern', 'junk', 'hear', 'now', '4', 'scene', 'where', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'Gordie', 'up', 'Kiefer', 'end', 'made', 'laugh', 'applaud', 'scene', 'such', 'determination', 'not', 'mention', 'intensity', 'look', 'face', 'gave', 'chills', 'almost', 'wanting', 'look', 'away', ""couldn't.Then"", 'something', 'Kiefer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'due', 'being', 'too', 'vulgar', 'cracked', 'end', 'still', 'today', 'One', 'Gordie', 'stories', 'book', 'was', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'expected', 'mind', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'least', 'time', 'frame', 'days', 'would', ""n't"", 'shock', 'many']",N/A

And again, and again...Directed by Rob Reiner (THE PRINCESS BRIDE), STAND BY ME is based on a novella by bestselling author Stephen King.  Wanting to understand STAND BY ME's origins, I searched it out.  THE BODY can be found in an anthology of King stories entitled DIFFERENT SEASONS.On to the movie...STAND BY ME centers on four 12 year-old boys: Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell).  Their hometown is in Maine - Castle Rock, to be precise, and the year is 1959.  Castle Rock is a small, sleepy town where not much happens.  But the four pals manage to stir up mischief all on their own.  Especially on their journey through the woods.  They've got only one goal in mind: to find the dead body of a Castle Rock boy their age who was hit by a train.  Vern overheard Chris' older brother's gang talking about how they knew where it was, how they'd be rewarded for alerting the township.River Phoenix shines throughout the movie, but not so much so that he overshadows his costars.  Each cast member gives an incredibly praise-worthy performance - the sleeper hit did garner quite a bit of critical praise during the 80's.  Jerry O'Connell, as Vern, is barely recognizeable.  With wide blue eyes, chubby cheeks, and a constant whine, he is the typical fat kid who always gets picked on.  Yet Chris, Gordie, and Teddy have taken him under their wing.  The four boys genuinely and sincerely care about each other and have relationships as tight-knit as that of blood brothers.An older and more aware Gordie Lachance narrates the story with voice-overs as he has achieved his dream of being an author and wants to tell the world of the friends he shared many middle school experiences with.  ""I never had friends like the ones I had when I was 12,"" Gordie laments.  ""Jesus, does anyone?""STAND BY ME will always be the best film of its coming-of-age genre.  Why?  The boys set off on a journey with typical kid wishes: to make a profit from discovering the dead body.  But they learn to rely on each other, care about each other, and emerge self-assured and more mature as a result.  This film is poignant, touching, and dripping with nostalgia, as well as quite humorous.  Not once does it cross the border into being overly sentiment or sappy.  The adventures and misadventures of 4 boys who ""come of age,"" so to speak, is one to be remembered throughout film history.R.I.P., River Phoenix.

9206,A15XTHGM4VS4WH,0767809246,Rennie Petersen,"[68, 70]","""Stand By Me"" is a classic coming of age movie about growing up and friendship and the pain of disillusionment when the adults you depend upon let you down. Highly recommended.In this review I'll focus mostly on the relationship between the movie and the Stephen King novella it is based on, and the DVD extra material that closes the ring.The movie ""Stand By Me"" was made in 1986. It is based on a novella published in 1982 and the story takes place in 1959 (movie) or 1960 (novella). But the story is timeless - the conflicts and the difficult transition from child to adult apply to every generation.There is a lot of trivia (pop songs, slang expressions, TV shows, etc.) from 1959/1960 in the movie and the novella, but this doesn't really anchor the story to that era. Every generation has it's own trivia that is very important to that generation.  But today's generation can smile at the trivia of 47 years ago and still see the parallels between that trivia and their (to them) much more wonderful trivia.The movie is based on a novella by Stephen King called ""The Body"". This is one of Stephen King's best stories, and is well worth reading or, if you like audio books, listening to. The audio version lasts almost six hours and is read by Frank Muller. Highly recommended. If you'd prefer to read the story yourself then you should buy the book ""Different Seasons"", a collection of four Stephen King novellas including ""The Body"".The movie and the novella are very similar. There are, of course, many small differences, for example the town of Castle Rock has been moved from Maine to Oregon, there is more coverage of the older juvenile delinquents and less coverage of Gordie's stories and of Gordie as an adult, the place where the bloodsuckers are encountered is different, etc., etc. The biggest difference is that in the novella Chris is the main protagonist, or hero if you like, while in the movie it is Gordie. Still, this movie is truer to the written source than most movies based on books are.So why did Rob Reiner make these changes, and what on earth did Stephen King think of them?Here's where the magic of DVD extra material comes in. The ""Special Edition"" (2000) and ""Deluxe Edition"" (2005) DVDs both include a 35-minute documentary ""featurette"" called ""Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me"", which was made in 2000. Stephen King, Rob Reiner and all of the major actors in the movie (except River Phoenix, who died in 1993) participate.In this documentary film Rob Reiner tells that he identified personally more with Gordie than Chris, and therefore decided to make the movie Gordie's story. And Stephen King says that he respected Rob Reiner's decision and thinks that ""Stand By Me"" was the first movie adaptation of his work that really fulfilled the spirit of the story.Stephen King also says that many of the things that happen in ""The Body"" and in ""Stand By Me"" are things he experienced himself in his childhood. This makes the story somewhat autobiographical, with Gordie being in some ways the young Stephen King. In the novella ""The Body"" this is quite pronounced in that an adult Gordie is telling the story in the first person, and also tells how he's now become a successful writer of horror books.So the bottom line is, if you like the movie then read or listen to the novella. And after you've read the novella and seen the movie, check out the DVD featurette that ties them together.Rennie Petersen",5,"Stand By Me: The novella, the movie and the DVD",1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,3450,"['Stand', 'Me', 'classic', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'friendship', 'pain', 'disillusionment', 'when', 'adults', 'depend', 'let', 'down', 'Highly', 'recommended.In', 'review', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'mostly', 'relationship', 'movie', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'based', 'DVD', 'extra', 'material', 'ring.The', 'movie', 'Stand', 'Me', 'was', 'made', '1986', 'based', 'novella', 'published', '1982', 'story', 'place', '1959', 'movie', '1960', 'novella', 'story', 'timeless', 'conflicts', 'difficult', 'transition', 'child', 'adult', 'apply', 'generation.There', 'lot', 'trivia', 'pop', 'songs', 'slang', 'expressions', 'TV', 'shows', 'etc', '1959/1960', 'movie', 'novella', ""n't"", 'really', 'anchor', 'story', 'era', 'generation', 'own', 'trivia', 'very', 'important', 'generation', 'today', 'generation', 'can', 'smile', 'trivia', '47', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'see', 'parallels', 'trivia', 'much', 'more', 'wonderful', 'trivia.The', 'movie', 'based', 'novella', 'Stephen', 'King', 'called', 'Body', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'best', 'stories', 'well', 'worth', 'reading', 'like', 'audio', 'books', 'listening', 'audio', 'version', 'almost', 'six', 'hours', 'read', 'Frank', 'Muller', 'Highly', 'recommended', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'read', 'story', 'then', 'should', 'buy', 'book', 'Different', 'Seasons', 'collection', 'four', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novellas', 'including', 'Body', '.The', 'movie', 'novella', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'are', 'course', 'many', 'small', 'differences', 'example', 'town', 'Castle', 'Rock', 'been', 'moved', 'Maine', 'Oregon', 'more', 'coverage', 'older', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'less', 'coverage', 'Gordie', 'stories', 'Gordie', 'adult', 'place', 'where', 'bloodsuckers', 'are', 'encountered', 'different', 'etc.', 'etc', 'biggest', 'difference', 'novella', 'Chris', 'main', 'protagonist', 'hero', 'like', 'movie', 'Gordie', 'Still', 'movie', 'truer', 'written', 'source', 'most', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'are.So', 'why', 'did', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'make', 'changes', 'what', 'earth', 'did', 'Stephen', 'King', 'think', 'Here', 'where', 'magic', 'DVD', 'extra', 'material', 'Special', 'Edition', '2000', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', '2005', 'DVDs', 'include', '35-minute', 'documentary', 'featurette', 'called', 'Walking', 'Tracks', 'Summer', 'Stand', 'Me', 'was', 'made', '2000', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'major', 'actors', 'movie', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'died', '1993', 'participate.In', 'documentary', 'film', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'identified', 'personally', 'more', 'Gordie', 'Chris', 'therefore', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'Gordie', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'respected', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'decision', 'Stand', 'Me', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'work', 'really', 'fulfilled', 'spirit', 'story.Stephen', 'King', 'also', 'many', 'things', 'happen', 'Body', 'Stand', 'Me', 'are', 'things', 'experienced', 'childhood', 'story', 'somewhat', 'autobiographical', 'Gordie', 'being', 'ways', 'young', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'Body', 'quite', 'pronounced', 'adult', 'Gordie', 'telling', 'story', 'first', 'person', 'also', 'how', 'now', 'successful', 'writer', 'horror', 'bottom', 'line', 'like', 'movie', 'then', 'read', 'listen', 'novella', ""'ve"", 'read', 'novella', 'seen', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'together.Rennie', 'Petersen']",N/A

They relay a true sense of companionship as the  young friends.Some of the highlights include Gordie's pie eating contest  story, the mad dash for Gordie and Vern to get to the other side of the  railroad bridge, and the scene where Gordie stands by Chris and tells  Ace(the older bully) to leave or there will be another dead body.If you  ever want to go back and relive some of the adventures of your childhood,  then you don't want to miss this movie.",5,Takes you back to childhood,964051200,"07 20, 2000",2000,1297,"['Stand', 'Me', 'one', 'movies', 'joys', 'being', 'kid', 'reminded', 'lot', 'fun', 'parts', 'childhood.The', 'movie', 'deals', 'four', 'boys', 'going', 'adventure', 'find', 'dead', 'body', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'quot', 'Body.', 'quot', 'four', 'boys', 'are', 'really', 'different', 'other', 'form', 'bond', 'will', 'always', 'exist', 'think', 'great', 'end', 'when', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'small', 'cameo', 'adult', 'Gordie', 'will', 'never', 'really', 'have', 'same', 'kind', 'friends', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'degree', 'believe', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'feeling.River', 'Phoenix', 'Chris', 'Chambers', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'Gordie', 'LaChance', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Teddy', 'Duchamp', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Vern', 'Tessio', 'are', 'great', 'four', 'buddies', 'who', 'travel', 'together', 'search', 'dead', 'body', 'relay', 'true', 'sense', 'companionship', 'young', 'friends.Some', 'highlights', 'include', 'Gordie', 'pie', 'eating', 'contest', 'story', 'mad', 'dash', 'Gordie', 'Vern', 'get', 'other', 'side', 'railroad', 'bridge', 'scene', 'where', 'Gordie', 'Chris', 'tells', 'Ace', 'older', 'bully', 'leave', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'body.If', 'ever', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'relive', 'adventures', 'childhood', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'movie']",N/A
9210,A3KUGUD8Y98CPC,0767809246,"Robert A. Williams ""political ethnographer""","[2, 6]","This profanity-ridden 1986 Hollywood film is based on the novella ""The Body"" by Jewish-American writer Stephen King - the first and only time he didn't write something quirky. Perhaps it would've been another idiosyncratic Stephen King film had it not been for the excellent directing by Rob Reiner? Stand By Me is good, very good.  It should become one of the Hollywood Club's classics, but many of today's generation never heard of it - and that's a shame.  The acting is superb. The viewer's emotional involvement with the characters is accomplished with a minimum of dialogue - Rob Reiner wastes no footage here.  It's about four 12 year old boys in a small Oregon town, three of whom nearly qualify as misfits by middle class standards, who hear about a dead body and decide to set out on an overnight expedition to find it before anyone else does.The film opens with one of the lads grown into adulthood, Gordie Lachance (played by Richard Dreyfuss) sitting in his car reading a newspaper obituary of one of the other lads ""Attorney Christopher Chambers Fatally Stabbed in Restaurant"", page C-3, The Oregonian, Wednesday, September 4, 1985.  He begins to reminisce about the time they set out to find the dead body - ""I was 12 going on 13 the first time I saw a dead human being.  It happened in the Summer of 1959, a long time ago"".The adult Gordie Lachance played by Richard Dreyfuss becomes the film's narrator as he recounts his childhood adventure.  The 1959 adventure begins when Vern Tessio (played by Jerry O'Connell) is under his front porch digging small holes in the hopes of discovering the spot where he had buried a jar full of pennies, overhears his older brother and his friend talking about the Dodge car that they stole, and hears they saw a boy that is probably the one that the news has been broadcasting as missing for last three days.  He hears them deduce that Ray Brauer must've been hit by a train when he when off to pick blueberries.  Vern runs to his friends hanging out in a treehouse with the news that if they follow the tracks, they can find a body.His friends are Teddy Duchamp (played by Corey Feldman), Gordie Lachance (played by Wil Wheaton), and Chris Chambers (played by River Phoenix).  Teddy Duchamp reacts by exclaiming that Ray Brauer was ""our age"" and they decide to do an overnight 20-mile expedition down the train tracks and locate one of their own fallen pre-teens.  They tell their parents that they are doing sleepovers at each other's houses - and in keeping with the cannon-fodder Hoopieville ways of their parents, none of the parents bother to phone the other parents to check any of this out.  Many blue-collar working class communities were that way during the 50s, 60s, 70s, and even 80s. Many of those older generations can relate to the film's time period and to the characters' behaviors.As these 4 lads make their way down the train tracks, we learn that three of them are suffering from a problem environment exacerbated by problem parents.  Gordie is grieving the death of his older brother 4 months previous, while suffering nightmares in which his father says ""It should've been you Gordon"".  Chris is suffering from low self-esteem resulting from the stigma of being a member of a worthless family headed by an alcoholic gun-keeping father (whose pistol Chris has brought along).  Teddy's father was even more abusive than Chris's dad - he was committed to an insane asylum after an abusive attack on Teddy.  Teddy, in turn, tells everyone his dad died storming the beach at Normandy on D-Day, while being haunted by the fact that he has a ""loonie"" for a dad.  Vern is the only one of the bunch that is not suffering from some emotional trauma - while the others are cussing away at the absurdities in their lives Vern fondly sings the praises of ""cherry-flavored PEZ"".These troubled kids represent real kids that had similar problems growing up in Baby Boomer working-class towns and many of the older generations will relate. Today's generation will find it difficult to relate to these boys - they have no cell phones, no handheld computer games, no rap or hip-hop.  But the boys do encounter a junkyard dog with a vicious reputation, a train dodge on a trestle (not by choice), coyotes, leeches, and teen-aged bullies with a knife-wielding ring leader ""Ace"" (played by Keifer Sutherland).  The campfire tale about ""Lard Ass"" is hilarious.When the boys do find the body, the bullies show up and pull a knife on Chris.  Gordie shoots Chris's dad's pistol into the air, then aims it at ""Ace"" the ringleader.  The bullies leave.  In the end, the boys decide to anonymously phone in the location of Ray Brauer's body.  The prize of finding the body was not as important as was the prize of self-discovery.The adult Gordie played by Richard Dreyfuss concludes by mentioning how though he hadn't seen Chris in 10 years, he will miss him.  And this touches on the American male's general inability to make deep friendships beyond childhood.  If we don't keep our childhood friends, we're lucky to have even one who we can be as close with as we were when we were young, vulnerable, and bonded together in confronting life's absurdities.  Gordie misses Chris; we miss our childhood friends.  A very sentimental movie that is unfortunately timebound.

9213,A3VMD1TVFCK9KB,0767809246,Robert P. Bogdanski,"[3, 4]","Another great 80s movie I grew up watching.Perhaps this is a personal bias because I had friends like this when I was 12, but having said that this is one of the best films I have ever seen and it hits every chord perfectly.There were four of us that were friends and we were known as the Stand By Me Crew. Mike, Wes, Mikey and myself were inseparable. And as this film prophesizes correctly, the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them. This movie makes you remember what it was like to have friends when you were 12 and it makes you glad that they were there when they were.The story involves these four kids going on a weekend hike to find a dead kid that apparently got hit by a train. Now if that is all the movie was about, it would probably be pretty boring. But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again. Twelve year olds deal with a plethora of issues and it is not often that adults listen to what kids have to say or see what they deal with. But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.The four boys are played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'ConnellCoosh from Jerry Maguire ), Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters. There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them. But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie (Wheaton) is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.What Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more. You can't help but get caught up in the nostalgia. Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons ( as I've already stated ) but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.The last line of the movie is so true. Do we really ever has friends as good as the ones when we were twelve?

But (along with WHMS) this man gave us Stand By Me.  I thank him and other for putting together this special DVD.When this movie came out in 1986, I was the same age as the boys in the film.  I was excited to see it when my parents rented it and for some reason I'll never forget this: I was grounded the night my parents were to watch it.  I was banished to my room (where I listened to the oldies station ironically).  I was sad, but moved on to summer camp and life...I rented some time later and liked it.  Then, for some stupid reason, I forgot about the movie.It wasn't until the holiday season and with my new DVD player keeping me warm, that I decided to revisit this classic.  Watching it (and the commentary and the really touching documentary--much better than the usual junk they slap together) touched me very deeply.  This film contains moments from your life.  It will move you.  It captures so perfectly exactly what that time is like.  It is a treasure.  I can't think of many other movies or TV shows (except the Wonder Years) that really gets what it is like to be a kid of that age.  There are no super smart kids here.  There are stupid adults.  Just real emotion.  It takes it place among my favorite works.  A real and true masterpiece.

This movie, sort of a memior on film,is about these four friends who go on  a trip to look for a dead boy's body in the woods in the 1950's was based  on a novella by Stephen King called 'The Body' featured in the book  'Different Seasons'.  This movie features some of the best performances of  young actors ever. First of all you must let me gush about River Phoneix.  It's such a shame he had to die, he was such a wonderful actor. In this  film he played Chris, a rebellious type who everyone thinks will end up  just like all his other family, mean and stupid. But Chris is smart and  sensitive and River Phoneix plays him with such revealing honesty that it's  hard not to cry just looking at his puckered little baby face! Then there's  Will Wheaton, and I've never seen this guy in anything else, which is a  shame. He plays Gordy, who's sort of the main character because he's the  one telling the story. His older brother ( played by John Cusack ( what a  hottie! ) in flashbacks ) has just died and his parents have forgotten he's  existed. He's rather reluctant on going to look for the body. Will is such  a cutie and I'm amazed at what a great actor this guy is, whatever has  become of him! He plays this guy with depth and he ends up being your  favorite one ( besides Chris ) in the end.  The other two, Vern ( played by  Jerry O'Connel who used to be fat, look at him now! ) and Teddy played by  an overtly flamboyant Corey Feldman.  Overall this film really depicts the  classic film study of 'coming of age' well. And being a teen I can relate  to every one of these characters, even if they're boys. So pick this one  up!

His father is cold and unloving and the family constantly recalls  the dead young man that could do no wrong, while neglecting the son that  they have in their midsts... preventing Gordie from being able to mourn the  brother he looked up to and misses dearly.A group of local teenage thugs  with names like &quot;Ace&quot; (Kiefer Sutherland) and &quot;Eyeball&quot;  are switch-blade wielding punks who happen upon the body of a mentally  challenged boy who has been missing for a few days.  As they make plans to  return to the site to recover the body for a reward, Eyeball's younger  brother (the late River Phoenix) and friend of Gordie's overhears the  details.Gordie and 3 of his closest pals embark on an adventure to  recover the body before the thugs do and have experiences that change their  lives in the process.  The story is far less about the body, and far more  about the relationships the boys have with their fathers and each  other.They camp out in the middle of woods during their adventure and  tell stories and share their hearts with one another. Sometimes tender,  sometimes drop dead funny, the story will give you a glimpse into the  tender side of boys they rarely feel comfortable in sharing in our culture.  Deep, caring guys who have been supressing their self-doubts, fears and  anger and sometimes manifesting the emotions in humor, delinquent behavior  or just overeating.The acting is superb and you feel less like you're  watching a film and more like you're one of these guys, joining them on  their adventure.It's amazing to see the chubby little Jerry O'Connell  who grew up to be the buff chick-magnet on &quot;Sliders&quot; and  bittersweet to see the late River Phoenix in his screen debut at a time in  his life when there were no drinking binges or illicit drugs.The film  is rich, tender and bittersweet.

9225,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,0767809246,Sky,"[0, 0]","Back in my junior year of college (circa 1982) I read a story called The Body by Stephen King that really touched me; I really could relate to the story and the characters.In The Body there's a preteen click of friends very similar to the band of mischief makers that I hung out with in my preteen years (circa 1972). To pass the time, they/we walked the local railroad tracks. They/we smoked cigarettes. They/we got bullied by the neighborhood bullies. They/we did traditional preteen stuff.One day, one of the band of buddies overhears his older brother (a local hoodlum/bully) telling the story of his knowledge of the whereabouts of a dead body. Upon relaying this intrusion to the rest of the click, they all set out on a journey down the tracks to see the body. And ultimately the journey is chock full of events that will stay in the memories of the group forever.So when I heard about 4 years after reading the novella (circa 1986) that Rob Reiner would do a film adaptation of The Body I just knew that it wouldn't...just couldn't...do justice to the book. What film adaptation ever does?Well, Stand By Me does (incidentally, so does Misery; you might say that Reiner is the king of King adaptations).Stand By Me was terrific. It kept all of the most impressionable book scenes entirely intact. And keep in mind that this was a Stephen King novella, so there's some pretty interesting stuff (you can count on King to wow you with precise tales of growing up as a baby boomer that include plenty of thrills...and when he doesn't thrill you he goes for the gross-out!).Importantly, the movie really captured the bonds of friendship so perfectly created in King's novella. The Body was a moving, realistic portrayal of a day in the life of some young kids in a small town; Stand By Me is The Body come to life.And kudos to the key young actors (Sutherland, Wheaton, O'Connell, Phoenix and Feldman) for exact incarnations of the characters in King's story, kudos to Reiner for his direction and kudos to all for putting their hearts into the roles to create a show that not only entertains, but evokes emotional reminisces in viewers that grew up in a very different world from today...the world of growing up in the 50s, 60s and 70s.Stand By Me is a collector's item.

This film is of a ""novella"" King wrote (drawing, as usual, from his own boyhood) about a foursome of pre-teen boys whose comraderie and determination takes them through a magic quest -- into the dark forest -- for the corpse of an agemate they didn't personally know.  It's one of four stories found in ""Different Seasons"", and the first of three from that book to make it to the big screen. Its mythic resonance is striking, with the youths planning their journey in what became a discovery of their own maturity, beyond their years.Unknown actors Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix are extraordinary, and each deserved an Oscar nomination for their roles. The first time drama for director Rob Reiner so impressed critics and fans that much was expected of him after this.  An insecure, yet creative boy and his son-of-an-alcoholic best friend lead their ""gang"" on an overnight  adventure, pitted against the small town's older ""dimestore hoods"" (Keifer Sutherland in an early role).  Along the way they face their own fears and sadness, fool round, and share ""bonding moments"".  Reiner directs with a boy's-eye-view, to the delight of all.Only caveat: [bad] language.  Only disappointment: Reiner deviates from the book during the leeches scene. River Phoenix went on to cutting edge roles, a cutting edge life, and a drug-related death.  Wil Wheaton went on to Star Trek: The Next Generation and the underrated film ""The Last Prostitute"".  Corey Feldman continued as a late-80s teen flick regular, and Jerry O'Connell did that Superman T.V. show.  As for bit players John Cusack and Richard Dreyfuss, their work continues to grow and evolve. Beware of versions which are edited for T.V.

The chemistry between the four boys out to find the body of a kid their age has always been an inspiration for me growing up.Rob Reiner's direction is tops. How he managed to get those four boys to act their hearts out is still a mystery today. The best comes out of River Phoenix as the troubled leader of the pack Chris Chambers, and Jerry O' Connell's part as the way-too-innocent scaredy cat Vern Tessio, Corey Feldman's turn as the crazy Teddy Duchamp, and Will Wheaton as the narrator of the story, the more focused than the others Gordon Lachance.

9229,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,0767809246,Steve Douglas,"[5, 5]","I really believe this movie will remain a classic and have legs for many years to come.  I have owned several editions with this being my first on Blu Ray.  No plot summaries or acting critiques here, just a review of the BR's quality.There is a definite improvement in color resolution on this Blu Ray transfer.  However, the movie retains its filmic look with soft focus unlike current films shot with that sharp contrasty video appearance. While it is not terribly noticeable as a bad transfer would be, the film does have its share of grain. Pause the film most any time and the grain becomes apparent.  You won't notice this while the movie is playing but you will notice the soft look of Stand By Me.The original audio was in mono and  you have the choice to retain that but you can also set it to DTSHD 5.1.  However, you will not get a whole lot from your surrounds and nothing from your sub. Never the less, there really never was any low bass at any point in the film.  The stereo front channels are used somewhat but not very much. The audio is well balanced and dialogue clear and distinguished so that once you set your volume you will not need to adjust it.Unfortunately, there are several previews on the disc which could have been better used by a lighter compression.  I have a real bug about disc space being taken up by movie previews.  The other extras are the directors commentary and a P in P commentary with Wil Wheaton and Corey Feldman along Rob Reiner.  When it went to the PnP, the only audio I heard was the movie track and not what the, now grown, actors were saying.  Didn't stay around long enough to figure it out but did wonder where Keifer Sutherland and Jerry O'Connell were.  There was also an extra with Stephen King talking about his memories of summers gone by that was pretty relatable to me.  Maybe that is why this has always been a favorite film.While there is color improvement to this Blu Ray version, I don't believe that if you already own the standard def version that you will gain much by buying the BluRay.  The choice is yours on this one.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Stand By Me on Blu Ray 25th Anniversary Edition,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,2432,"['really', 'believe', 'movie', 'will', 'remain', 'classic', 'have', 'legs', 'many', 'years', 'come', 'have', 'owned', 'several', 'editions', 'being', 'first', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'plot', 'summaries', 'acting', 'critiques', 'here', 'just', 'review', 'BR', 'quality.There', 'definite', 'improvement', 'color', 'resolution', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'However', 'movie', 'filmic', 'look', 'soft', 'focus', 'current', 'films', 'shot', 'sharp', 'contrasty', 'video', 'appearance', 'not', 'terribly', 'noticeable', 'bad', 'transfer', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'have', 'share', 'grain', 'Pause', 'film', 'most', 'time', 'grain', 'apparent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'movie', 'playing', 'will', 'notice', 'soft', 'look', 'Stand', 'Me.The', 'original', 'audio', 'was', 'mono', 'have', 'choice', 'retain', 'can', 'also', 'set', 'DTSHD', '5.1', 'However', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'whole', 'lot', 'surrounds', 'nothing', 'sub', 'less', 'really', 'never', 'was', 'low', 'bass', 'point', 'film', 'stereo', 'front', 'channels', 'are', 'used', 'somewhat', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'audio', 'well', 'balanced', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'distinguished', 'so', 'once', 'set', 'volume', 'will', 'not', 'need', 'adjust', 'it.Unfortunately', 'are', 'several', 'previews', 'disc', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'used', 'lighter', 'compression', 'have', 'real', 'bug', 'disc', 'space', 'being', 'taken', 'up', 'movie', 'previews', 'other', 'extras', 'are', 'directors', 'commentary', 'P', 'P', 'commentary', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'When', 'went', 'PnP', 'only', 'audio', 'heard', 'was', 'movie', 'track', 'not', 'what', 'now', 'grown', 'actors', 'were', 'saying', 'Did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'around', 'long', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'did', 'wonder', 'where', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'were', 'was', 'also', 'extra', 'Stephen', 'King', 'talking', 'memories', 'summers', 'gone', 'was', 'pretty', 'relatable', 'Maybe', 'why', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'film.While', 'color', 'improvement', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'already', 'own', 'standard', 'def', 'version', 'will', 'gain', 'much', 'buying', 'BluRay', 'choice', 'yours', 'one.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A
9230,A359IT81FBX64Y,0767809246,Steven Mason,"[1, 18]","""Stand By Me,"" sometimes confused with ""Lean On Me,"" is both a coming of age and nostalgia story. The main characters are 12-year-old boys, but it is rated R so many parents might not want to watch it with their 12-year-old kids.As a coming of age story, it's pretty rough - the school of hard knocks - and I don't say this because of the dead body. All of the adults are seriously dysfunctional, all of the kids are either abused or neglected. Among the four boys, only Gordie and Chris have a solid friendship. Gordie, a thoughtful and understandably insecure boy, is believable, but Chris is too knowing, wise, and supportive for a kid, so at times it seems he is Gordie's adult mentor more than his kid friend. Any kid would benefit from a friend like Chris (indeed, any adult would benefit from a friend like Chris!). I point this out because when I watch a coming of age story, I expect to see kids coming of age rather than acting like wise adults facing tough challenges. I can cheer for kids who act like wise, brave, and strong adults, but I can't quite believe it. Chris and Gordie's superstar brother (John Cusack) seemed a bit too supportive of Gordie's writing to be believable; it's more likely they would have teased him about it. Sure, it made me feel all warm and fuzzy to see that kind of support, but it was overdone and got sappy.It's a movie, so I know that a lot has to happen to keep things interesting. But as a story, it seems a little much. In the space of a couple of days, the boys run into the local gang of violent hoodlums, an attack dog, a train, and a dead body. If such exciting things happened to the average kid, there'd be a lot of great stories to tell. I guess dysfunctional parents and bad childhoods have their benefits, while good, safe childhoods are boring by comparison. :-) Conveniently enough for the story, the feud between the boys and the violent gang is left unresolved. When the leader of the gang told the boys that he would ""get them,"" I had no doubt that he would. But somehow he didn't, and I have no idea why.The nostalgia in the film is a mixed bag.

9231,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,0767809246,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[6, 8]","Rob Reiner's &quot;Stand By Me&quot; is a celebration of those youthful adventures that eventually transform into cherished memories as the years go by.  It is also a touching tale centered around the strong ties of friendship and the eventual loss of innocence one experiences when one comes of age.  Definitely unusual themes when you consider the original source material for the film was a work by horror-master Stephen King.Gordie LaChance (Will Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) set out one day to find the body of a missing child.  They stumble into a series of adventures along their journey when they encounter a vicious dog, an oncoming train, leeches, and a group of older boys who also are searching for the body.  By the time the four boys end their trek, they realize that their childhood ended during their quest and that they have taken the first steps into adulthood.Not many films succeed in developing their characters to the point where they truly feel like flesh-and-blood individuals.  However, Reiner amazingly manages to vividly define and develop the film's four young leads to the point where they start to stir up distant memories and lead you to recall certain friends you had while you were growing up.  By the time ""Stand By Me"" ends, Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern have transcend their fictional existence and have started to merge with the memories you possess of the pals you had in your youth.  The coming of age aspect of the film also is emotionally powerful as it forces you to remember the exact point in your life when you ceased to be a child and moved into a new phase in life.  A tip of the hat to Reiner and his young performers for creating such an engaging and nostalgic cinematic work.",3,&quot;Mighty Mouse is a cartoon.

It has hoodlums. It has flashbacks. And it has cussing cause it's cool. Although none of these actors, with the exception of Kiefer Sutherland, went on to make very major careers, maybe in River Phoenix's case because of his suicide, they all gave very convincing performances. The story was phenomenally captivating.From the start you won't want to stop, it is so much fun. It is a very serious movie, but at the same time it has a lot of well placed humor. All the characters have very distinctive and very likable personalities. The only thing I didn't like was the end where they told us what became of the boys as adults, and said the ""bad boy"" was going to turn his life around but was stabbed.

It is incredible how much we learn about the four friends - Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern - in a relatively short amount of time.  This can be credited to the performances of the young actors (all are excellent but River Phoenix really shines) guided by the expert direction of Rob Reiner and maybe most importantly the heartfelt source material, the novella THE BODY by Stephen King which is one of his best efforts outside of the pure horror genre.One of the things that impressed me most about the film is the kids talk, act and think like real kids of that age still do today and probably always will.  It's a shame the film is rated R because of its rough but realistic language since a lot of kids in the 12 - 16 years old age bracket could readily identify with the characters and the themes though granted this is certainly no kiddie movie for the under twelve set.

Well, that's what ""Stand By Me"" is about; a brilliant mix of laugh-out-loud humor and introspective moments of awe, it's a movie that never wears thin.The overall plot is that four boys, from ages twelve to thirteen, hear of a dead body and go searching overnight for it. There's plenty of summer adventure in it, big laughs among friends, and that feeling of living in the wild, if only for about forty-eight hours. And then, there's that feeling of change that, for at least one point in our life, we get nervous about. That necessity of holding onto friends even as you get separated from there. It puts you in such a state, as it's displayed in such an honest, realistic way that it captivates you all the way through.What impresses me a lot about ""Stand By Me"" is how it just seems to carry on at full speed. There never seems to be a dull moment and by the time it's over, you may feel astonished that it's already done with. Like with a lot of other, great movies, this one has many, sub-situations the four guys get themselves into, and if it's not enough that they're racing a gang of older guys and outrun a junkyard dog, need I say more than such things as ""campfire stories"" or ""a lake of leeches""? *shudders*Without revealing the resolution, the ending shows the adult Gordie, who has been narrating the whole thing. The ending is very powerful and moving, and as the credits roll, the '61 song ""Stand By Me"" plays.This is an excellent summer movie that goes by quickly, but leaves such an impression on you that you'll remember and love it forever.

For example, he likes Final Fantasy 7 on the Playstation while I prefer the strategy of Civilization or Links LS. But we both agree that Stand By Me is one of the best coming of age films ever made. And the new special edition DVD greatly enhances the enjoymenmt of the film.The story, set in 1959, involves four boys who set out on a journey to find the body of a boy killed in a train accident. The late River Phoenix plays Chris Chambers, the street wise leader of the group. Will Wheaton is Gordie La Chance from whose perspective the story is told. Cory Feldman plays Teddy an abused son of a World War II vet and Jerry O'Connell provides comic relief as the goofy but loveable Vern. The performances by these young men are truly outstanding. My only complaint is too many four-letter words especially the &quot;F&quot; word. I'm no prude, but I think it would have been more believable to have saved this type of language for only the most intense scenes.This is a wonderful film for fathers and sons to watch together. My son seemed to really relate to the characters despite the very different era involved. Having grown up in the late sixties and early seventies I was able to find a lot of common ground with these four boys. Another thing that amazed me is my son loved the soundtrack of late fifties hits. Watching this film with your kids also provides a great opportunity to discuss the tragic death of River Phoenix and ease into the waters on the dangers of drugs.The video quality of this DVD is very good with little noticeable grain or digital artifacts. The widescreen version only adds to the enjoyment of the great exterior scenes. I am very happy to report that the new special edition of this disc adds several new features including an excellent documentary called &quot;Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me&quot;. Featured are Stephen King, Rob Reiner, Will Wheaton, Jerry O'Connell and Kiefer Southerland. True fans of the movie will not want to be without this new special edition.In spite of the profanity, I highly recommend this film especially on DVD. Rob Reiner has made a movie which will be remembered as a classic of its genre and is sure to be loved by all ages.",5,Great for Fathers and Sons-Update Special Edition DVD!,956793600,"04 27, 2000",2000,2300,"['son', 'who', '13', 'decidedly', 'different', 'tastes', 'do', 'when', 'entertainment', 'example', 'Final', 'Fantasy', '7', 'Playstation', 'prefer', 'strategy', 'Civilization', 'Links', 'LS', 'agree', 'Stand', 'Me', 'one', 'best', 'coming', 'age', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'new', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'greatly', 'enjoymenmt', 'film.The', 'story', 'set', '1959', 'four', 'boys', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'journey', 'find', 'body', 'boy', 'killed', 'train', 'accident', 'late', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Chris', 'Chambers', 'street', 'wise', 'leader', 'group', 'Will', 'Wheaton', 'Gordie', 'La', 'Chance', 'perspective', 'story', 'told', 'Cory', 'Feldman', 'Teddy', 'abused', 'son', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'vet', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'comic', 'relief', 'goofy', 'loveable', 'Vern', 'performances', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'only', 'complaint', 'too', 'many', 'four-letter', 'words', 'especially', 'quot', 'F', 'quot', 'word', ""'m"", 'prude', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'have', 'saved', 'type', 'language', 'only', 'most', 'intense', 'scenes.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'fathers', 'sons', 'watch', 'together', 'son', 'seemed', 'really', 'relate', 'characters', 'very', 'different', 'era', 'involved', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'late', 'sixties', 'early', 'seventies', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'lot', 'common', 'ground', 'four', 'boys', 'thing', 'amazed', 'son', 'loved', 'soundtrack', 'late', 'fifties', 'hits', 'Watching', 'film', 'kids', 'also', 'great', 'opportunity', 'discuss', 'tragic', 'death', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'ease', 'waters', 'dangers', 'drugs.The', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'little', 'noticeable', 'grain', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'widescreen', 'version', 'only', 'enjoyment', 'great', 'exterior', 'scenes', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'report', 'new', 'special', 'edition', 'disc', 'several', 'new', 'features', 'including', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'called', 'quot', 'Walking', 'Tracks', 'Summer', 'Stand', 'Me', 'quot', 'Featured', 'are', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Will', 'Wheaton', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Kiefer', 'Southerland', 'True', 'fans', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'new', 'special', 'edition.In', 'spite', 'profanity', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'especially', 'DVD', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'made', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'classic', 'genre', 'sure', 'be', 'loved', 'ages']",N/A

Mike Leigh on ALL OR NOTHING and John Hughes on FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF were two examples, and to those I now add Rob Reiner's warm-hearted commentary on his 1986 coming-of-age drama STAND BY ME.STAND BY ME follows the journey of three twelve-year-old boys from smalltown Oregon as they set out in search of the body of Ray Brauer. The gorgeously lensed west-coast scenery provides the backdrop for the boys' own inner journeys at a seminal point in their young lives. Sure, the nostalgic coming-of-age thing has been done many times, but rarely as well as this and with such affection and believability.It seems, at least in my memory, that this film was rather overlooked on its initial release, but I predict it will be remembered as a true classic in the generations to come.",5,Unforgettable drama,1092614400,"08 16, 2004",2004,942,"['DVD', 'commentaries', 'enjoy', 'most', 'are', 'give', 'new', 'insight', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'feel', 'stories', 'tell', 'characters', 'bring', 'life', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'ALL', 'OR', 'NOTHING', 'John', 'Hughes', 'FERRIS', 'BUELLER', 'DAY', 'OFF', 'were', 'two', 'examples', 'now', 'add', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'warm-hearted', 'commentary', '1986', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'STAND', 'BY', 'ME.STAND', 'BY', 'ME', 'journey', 'three', 'twelve-year-old', 'boys', 'smalltown', 'Oregon', 'set', 'out', 'search', 'body', 'Ray', 'Brauer', 'gorgeously', 'lensed', 'west-coast', 'scenery', 'backdrop', 'boys', 'own', 'inner', 'journeys', 'seminal', 'point', 'young', 'lives', 'Sure', 'nostalgic', 'coming-of-age', 'thing', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'rarely', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'affection', 'believability.It', 'least', 'memory', 'film', 'was', 'rather', 'overlooked', 'initial', 'release', 'predict', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'true', 'classic', 'generations', 'come']",N/A

9252,AP3B615GM191G,0767809246,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 7]","In the novella ""The Body"" written by Stephen King that this film is based upon, a group of boys set out to find a local dead body, and end up finding more out about themselves than anything.  Along the way, master wordsmith King is able to develop each and every character to a point where readers can really care for or sympathize with their problems or successes.In this film version, ""Stand By Me"", though, that incredible character development is lacking.  I realize I am a bit ""tainted"", as I know what I was missing, but suffice it to say that after the novella experience, the film just seemed to lack that extra ""oomph"" to turn it into any sort of classic.Of course, I probably am expecting the impossible in this situation, as director Rob Reiner likely did everything he could to develop four very different young men in the span of only 88 minutes, but just that limitation alone drags the story down a bit. Whereas King (as he is known to do) can, in a very in-depth fashion, probe the personal lives of each of his characters, Reiner is restricted to a series of flashbacks that just don't have the same emotional connection with the viewer as King does with the reader.Now, don't get me wrong...I don't think that this is a bad film by any stretch of the word.  If you have not read the novella, I think you might be inclined to give it another star in the rating column (don't expect ""classic"" status, though).  However, if you (like I was) are looking for faces to be put to King's classic characters, locations, and themes, then you will likely be a bit disappointed, as ""Stand By Me"" fails to carry that mantra like some others have (including ""The Shawshank Redemption"", a classic movie based on a story in the same collection as ""The Body"").",3,Lacks The Character Development Of King's Novella,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,1761,"['novella', 'Body', 'written', 'Stephen', 'King', 'film', 'based', 'group', 'boys', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'local', 'dead', 'body', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'more', 'anything', 'way', 'master', 'wordsmith', 'King', 'able', 'develop', 'character', 'point', 'where', 'readers', 'can', 'really', 'care', 'sympathize', 'problems', 'successes.In', 'film', 'version', 'Stand', 'Me', 'though', 'incredible', 'character', 'development', 'lacking', 'realize', 'am', 'bit', 'tainted', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'say', 'novella', 'experience', 'film', 'just', 'seemed', 'lack', 'extra', 'oomph', 'turn', 'sort', 'classic.Of', 'course', 'probably', 'am', 'expecting', 'impossible', 'situation', 'director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'likely', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'develop', 'four', 'very', 'different', 'young', 'men', 'span', 'only', '88', 'minutes', 'just', 'limitation', 'alone', 'story', 'down', 'bit', 'Whereas', 'King', 'known', 'do', 'can', 'very', 'in-depth', 'fashion', 'probe', 'personal', 'lives', 'characters', 'Reiner', 'restricted', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'emotional', 'connection', 'viewer', 'King', 'reader.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'film', 'stretch', 'word', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novella', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'inclined', 'give', 'star', 'rating', 'column', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'classic', 'status', 'though', 'However', 'was', 'are', 'looking', 'be', 'put', 'King', 'classic', 'characters', 'locations', 'themes', 'then', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Stand', 'Me', 'carry', 'mantra', 'others', 'have', 'including', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'classic', 'movie', 'based', 'story', 'same', 'collection', 'Body']",N/A
