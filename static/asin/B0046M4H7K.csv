1387774,A226XTFHOLF2DH,B0046M4H7K,CathiD,"[8, 8]","My daughter took me to see Celtic Thunder during a recent trip to CA, and the only disappointment I had all evening was that they didn't do any Christmas music.  When we returned to Houston, I checked to see whether their show there would have any, but no, so I was really disappointed, since I loved the CD.  What I will say for those of you who have been disappointed about the lack of Celtic music of late is, just wait for their Heritage album coming this spring.  Now on to the DVD - I'm ordering it just after I saw their PBS show last night and can tell you that it will be a part of my essential Christmas Library from here on out.  Phil Coulter's ""Christmas Day Donegal"" sung by Paul accompanied by a boys' choir was probably the highlight, but their harmony on Silent Night - in both Gaelic and English - is supremely haunting, as is Christmas 1915.  Yes, we're all shocked when the young man who sung Silent Night in No Man's Land was killed in the fighting the next day, but that is what war is and if you'll listen on, you'll hear a plea for peace.  If I had to say I was disappointed in any of the songs, it was Keith's ""Last Christmas"" - his performance was wonderful but I was disappointed in the choice of that particular song.  Neil has been such an addition to the group, and I loved his ""When You Wish..."".  Paul's ""Ave Maria"" is one of the best I've ever heard.  George, Ryan, Damian, you never disappoint me.  I guess the thing that touches me most about Celtic Thunder is that they truly appear to like one another - as is so evident during the little 'bits' with one another that you see during their performances.  They appear to truly be a family - and you can tell by the shots of all the families shown on the DVD as they are either moved to tears, as the girls (old and young) react to Damian and his awesome stage presence, and as men and women alike just enjoy this presentation, that there was something for everyone in this show.  Thanks, Phil Coulter and thanks Celtic Thunder - my daughter and her military-husband won't be here this Christmas - but her Concert gift, and now the CT Christmas CD and DVD, give me something to enjoy until ""Next Christmas""...or the Heritage CD.",5,This is a Must for Christmas,1291334400,"12 3, 2010",2010,2211,"['daughter', 'took', 'see', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'recent', 'trip', 'CA', 'only', 'disappointment', 'had', 'evening', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'Christmas', 'music', 'When', 'returned', 'Houston', 'checked', 'see', 'show', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'loved', 'CD', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'Celtic', 'music', 'late', 'just', 'wait', 'Heritage', 'album', 'coming', 'spring', 'Now', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'ordering', 'just', 'saw', 'PBS', 'show', 'last', 'night', 'can', 'tell', 'will', 'be', 'part', 'essential', 'Christmas', 'Library', 'here', 'out', 'Phil', 'Coulter', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'Donegal', 'sung', 'Paul', 'accompanied', 'boys', 'choir', 'was', 'probably', 'highlight', 'harmony', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Gaelic', 'English', 'supremely', 'haunting', 'Christmas', '1915', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'shocked', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'sung', 'Silent', 'Night', 'No', 'Man', 'Land', 'was', 'killed', 'fighting', 'next', 'day', 'what', 'war', ""'ll"", 'listen', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'plea', 'peace', 'had', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'songs', 'was', 'Keith', 'Last', 'Christmas', 'performance', 'was', 'wonderful', 'was', 'disappointed', 'choice', 'particular', 'song', 'Neil', 'been', 'addition', 'group', 'loved', 'When', 'Wish', 'Paul', 'Ave', 'Maria', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'George', 'Ryan', 'Damian', 'never', 'disappoint', 'guess', 'thing', 'most', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'truly', 'appear', 'like', 'one', 'so', 'evident', 'little', ""'bits"", 'one', 'see', 'performances', 'appear', 'truly', 'be', 'family', 'can', 'tell', 'shots', 'families', 'shown', 'DVD', 'are', 'moved', 'tears', 'girls', 'old', 'young', 'react', 'Damian', 'awesome', 'stage', 'presence', 'men', 'women', 'alike', 'just', 'enjoy', 'presentation', 'was', 'something', 'everyone', 'show', 'Thanks', 'Phil', 'Coulter', 'thanks', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'daughter', 'military-husband', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'here', 'Christmas', 'Concert', 'gift', 'now', 'CT', 'Christmas', 'CD', 'DVD', 'give', 'something', 'enjoy', 'Next', 'Christmas', 'Heritage', 'CD']",N/A

The production values on this DVD are well done: great editing and pace, crisp visuals, and good sound.  The special features consist of a slideshow featuring behind-the-scenes and concert photographs, set to Keith Harkin's ""All I Want for Christmas"", and solo performances of each of the singers from the concert.  Personally, I don't see the advantage of having the solo performances available separately since you can just as easily select them from the program menu...but the concert is so good the special features don't really matter.Neil Byrne gets more air time this time around and I especially like his performance of ""When You Wish Upon A Star.""  All members of the group are provided ample opportunity to shine, and each provides a stirring and memorable performance.  As always, when the five men (now six) get together to sing it is pure magic and if you weren't in the Christmas spirit at the start of the show you surely should be by the end.As with the first Celtic Thunder DVD, the audience is an integral part of the experience and shots of the audience reacting to the various performances are artfully intertwined without being distracting.  I really enjoyed this DVD and hope there will be more yet to come.  Celtic Thunder delivers great music, great energy, and a show I think will be fun to watch even in the heat of a July summer.",5,CHRISTMAS THUNDER CELTIC STYLE,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,1481,"['are', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'just', 'now', 'getting', 'acquainted', 'group', 'DVD', 'sure', 'please', 'production', 'values', 'DVD', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'great', 'editing', 'pace', 'crisp', 'visuals', 'good', 'sound', 'special', 'features', 'consist', 'slideshow', 'featuring', 'behind-the-scenes', 'concert', 'photographs', 'set', 'Keith', 'Harkin', 'Want', 'Christmas', 'solo', 'performances', 'singers', 'concert', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'advantage', 'having', 'solo', 'available', 'separately', 'can', 'just', 'easily', 'select', 'program', 'menu', 'concert', 'so', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter.Neil', 'Byrne', 'more', 'air', 'time', 'time', 'especially', 'performance', 'When', 'Wish', 'A', 'Star', 'members', 'group', 'are', 'provided', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'stirring', 'memorable', 'performance', 'always', 'when', 'five', 'men', 'now', 'six', 'get', 'together', 'sing', 'pure', 'magic', 'were', ""n't"", 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'start', 'show', 'surely', 'should', 'be', 'end.As', 'first', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'DVD', 'audience', 'integral', 'part', 'experience', 'shots', 'audience', 'reacting', 'various', 'performances', 'are', 'artfully', 'intertwined', 'being', 'distracting', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'hope', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'yet', 'come', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'delivers', 'great', 'music', 'great', 'energy', 'show', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'heat', 'July', 'summer']",N/A

Maybe I'm a ""bit"" prejudice, but I've liked this group since the first time I saw them air on PBS, featuring: Celtic Thunder The Show, some three or four years ago. The voices are clear and pure. Their act is ""clean"" and family oriented.  They seem to enjoy what they are doing and really want the audience to enjoy it also.  Their attire is always appropriate, (no baggy/falling off pants...).Each singer has a voice unique within itself. Each stand alone, well, but as a group are cohesive and equally talented within their own genre. Even though they are entertaining, they portray a ""realness"",not a 'showbiz/fake' air. I personally believe this in an innate quality, nothing ""learned"". This is most attractive and soooooooooooooo refreshing!My hope is that they keep the Celtic flavor (that's what attracted me to them in the first place, along with their sincerity)... a few of the songs on this Christmas album kept the Celtic flavor. I realy liked: Silent Night, Amazing Grace, Christmas Morning in Donegal, Last Christmas, Ave Maria, Christmas 1915, Baby It's Cold Outside...Let's face it, I liked the entire album!One thing though, I cannot get to the second list of songs to select a particular song on that list - I have to play the last song on the on the first list and then fast forward (while DVD is still playing) to get to the particular song I want to hear on the second list.

I have followed them from the beginning and have seen them close-up in concert.  It is hard not to relate to them as real people who you can be friends with, not distant ""celebrities"".  Their first DVD was pure magic and won them into my heart and many of my friends became instant fans.Over time they have moved somewhat from their Celtic roots to include popular mainstream music, which has been fine.  If I have ever been disappointed by a Celtic Thunder DVD, this Christmas album is it.  It seems very short and lacking in any creative production values.  It is simply a collection of hard cuts from one song to another, taped at live concerts (which has worked great for them in the past).  The song selection is shocking.  Not only was Silent Night the only song that (briefly) reflected their Celtic heritage, that was absolutely it ... there are such beautiful Irish/Scottish Christmas songs and the producers reduced this DVD down to the lowest common denominator with some really cheesy songs like ""Last Christmas"" which was a one-season pop hit with a limited audience and ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" which has nothing to do with Christmas.I was surprised to hear a song, sung before a mature audience with many children, about a nice young German soldier who sang of peace but was nevertheless killed.  What does this have to do with Christmas?  The performers did and always do give 110% and each is talented, however one of the smartest moves the producers could have made was to promote Neil Byrne to the front line, in fact he opened the show.  Neil is multi-talented and I would submit he now is possibly the most multi-textured and richly deep talent of the group.  He was wonderful in concert and I think actually helped saved this DVD.The set, as always, was simple but beautiful and I hope no one bypasses this DVD because of my comments.  It is not a bad show ... Celtic Thunder is incapable of doing a bad show ... it is just unfortunately tritely American when the expectation was, and should be, that it would include some of the rich beauty of Celtic heritage.A final disappointment is that the ""bonus"" content is nothing more than an index of the singer's individual songs and a really bad slide show.  It is almost an insult compared to the bonus track on their first DVD, with interviews of ""the boys"" in their native environment, speaking in barely understandable brogues.  It was charming and made them real. This DVD did nothing but make them more remote.",4,Could have been so much more!,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,2550,"['not', 'possible', 'give', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'bad', 'review', 'have', 'followed', 'beginning', 'have', 'seen', 'close-up', 'concert', 'hard', 'not', 'relate', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'friends', 'not', 'distant', 'celebrities', 'first', 'DVD', 'was', 'pure', 'magic', 'won', 'heart', 'many', 'friends', 'became', 'instant', 'fans.Over', 'time', 'have', 'moved', 'somewhat', 'Celtic', 'roots', 'include', 'popular', 'mainstream', 'music', 'been', 'fine', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'album', 'very', 'short', 'lacking', 'creative', 'production', 'values', 'simply', 'collection', 'hard', 'cuts', 'one', 'song', 'taped', 'live', 'concerts', 'worked', 'great', 'past', 'song', 'selection', 'shocking', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Silent', 'Night', 'only', 'song', 'briefly', 'reflected', 'Celtic', 'heritage', 'was', 'absolutely', 'are', 'such', 'beautiful', 'Irish/Scottish', 'Christmas', 'songs', 'producers', 'reduced', 'DVD', 'down', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'really', 'cheesy', 'songs', 'Last', 'Christmas', 'was', 'one-season', 'pop', 'hit', 'limited', 'audience', 'Baby', 'Cold', 'Outside', 'nothing', 'do', 'Christmas.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'hear', 'song', 'sung', 'mature', 'audience', 'many', 'children', 'nice', 'young', 'German', 'soldier', 'who', 'sang', 'peace', 'was', 'nevertheless', 'killed', 'What', 'have', 'do', 'Christmas', 'performers', 'did', 'always', 'do', 'give', '110', '%', 'talented', 'however', 'one', 'smartest', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'was', 'promote', 'Neil', 'Byrne', 'front', 'line', 'fact', 'opened', 'show', 'Neil', 'multi-talented', 'would', 'submit', 'now', 'possibly', 'most', 'multi-textured', 'richly', 'deep', 'talent', 'group', 'was', 'wonderful', 'concert', 'think', 'actually', 'helped', 'saved', 'DVD.The', 'set', 'always', 'was', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'hope', 'one', 'DVD', 'comments', 'not', 'bad', 'show', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'incapable', 'doing', 'bad', 'show', 'just', 'unfortunately', 'tritely', 'American', 'when', 'expectation', 'was', 'should', 'be', 'would', 'include', 'rich', 'beauty', 'Celtic', 'heritage.A', 'final', 'disappointment', 'bonus', 'content', 'nothing', 'more', 'index', 'singer', 'individual', 'songs', 'really', 'bad', 'slide', 'show', 'almost', 'insult', 'compared', 'bonus', 'track', 'first', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'boys', 'native', 'environment', 'speaking', 'barely', 'understandable', 'brogues', 'was', 'charming', 'made', 'real', 'DVD', 'did', 'nothing', 'make', 'more', 'remote']",N/A
