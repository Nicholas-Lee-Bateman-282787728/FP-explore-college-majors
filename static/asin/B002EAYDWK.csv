Great plot in this one. Beautiful women. The price was great also,5,Big fan of these two actors The way old used to be with Class instead of A......,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,208,"['Well', 'am', 'fan', 'actors', 'played', 'other', 'movies', 'together', 'one', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'ones', 'aswell', 'classic', 'Great', 'plot', 'one', 'Beautiful', 'women', 'price', 'was', 'great', 'also']",N/A

There were some places where I literally guffawed. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr had a lovely chemistry that was illuminated every time they made a movie together.  In this film, it was obvious that they were in it to have a good time.  Some of the amusing looks between them came across as absolutely genuine.  I enjoyed this film and think that I'd have no problems watching it again.Oh, and I would have killed to see this filmed in color just to get the full effect of Deborah Kerr's wardrobe.

1265029,A1J3JGDC7DGDV8,B002EAYDWK,Loves Labs,"[8, 10]",This is a great DVD with good quality. Some of the other archive collection DVDs have better quality as this one has a couple of places where the voice and lips are not in sync but I still recommend this. I had never seen this movie before buying the DVD but it is very funny and Cary Grant is just wonderful.All of the Archive Collection DVDs are available from the Turner website for $17.99.

Rivers,"[1, 1]","""Dream Wife"" (1953) marked the inauspicious pairing of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr - a few years before their classic screen encounter in ""An Affair to Remember."" Director Sidney Sheldon's contrived romantic comedy makes the elegant Grant look foolish and decidedly haggard. Not even the presence of Walter Pidgeon can save this dreary product from the MGM assembly line.
