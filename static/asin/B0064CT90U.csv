1509255,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B0064CT90U,Chrijeff,"[1, 2]","The second season of this beloved Western finds ranch owner and relay-station operator Slim Sherman (John Smith) and his ranchhand and friend, ex-drifter and fast gun Jess Harper (Robert Fuller), batching it as Slim's younger brother Andy (Robert Crawford, Jr., who does make a few return appearances and is often referred to in the dialogue) departs for school in St. Louis with cook/factotum Jonesy along to ""ride herd on him.""  (Hoagy Carmichael's contract had expired, and for reasons unclear the producers didn't try to renegotiate it, but basically wrote him and Andy out of the series.)  Their relationship is easier now, though sometimes strained by the unexpected chores added to those connected with range work and stagecoaches, and while Jess's temper is still of the short-and-explosive variety, he seems less inclined to take off either because of some old obligation or because of something unpleasant from his past catching up with him; his less-than-stellar past doesn't intrude on his new life as often in this season as in the last, despite the fact that at one point he's kidnapped all the way to Utah to lead the way to a hidden cache of stolen coin, and in another segment is arrested by a Colorado lawman of unsavory reputation for a murder he didn't commit (Slim gets himself deputized and rides along to make sure Jess doesn't come down with a case of lead in the back--although Jess can't understand why Slim won't gang up on the man with him).  Another time he's used as bait to force Slim's hand; Slim stands to be shot if he responds to the ultimatum, but he knows he'll at least have a chance to defend himself, where Jess will be hanged if he doesn't go--and Jess never doubts his friend will come for him.  Meanwhile, Slim proves again his devotion to ""what's right"" as he copes with the prejudices of his neighbors when he tries to get a cattleman put on trial for murder in connection with the death of an Indian working for the Sherman Ranch.  Along the way we also learn something of Slim's family (an Uncle Jack who was ""a terrible liar,"" a long-standing feud with another family).A regular ""stock company"" of guest stars has begun to develop, with such names as Ernest Borgnine, Dan Duryea, Jocelyn Brando, Edgar Buchanan, John Anderson, L. Q. Jones, Rod Cameron, William Bryant, Ben Johnson (the last four twice), and James Anderson (three times) all returning from First Season, and others (Robert J. Wilkie, Denver Pyle, Lee Van Cleef, R. G. Armstrong, Harry Lauter, Roy Barcroft, and Gregory Walcott) making repeat appearances (the last three times, the others twice).  John McIntire and Denny/Scott Miller, both of whom Robert Fuller was later to work with in ""Wagon Train,"" also appear, as do Steve McNally (the bad brother inWinchester '73, Claude Akins, Harold J. Stone, Vera Miles, Robert Vaughan, Ross Martin ofThe Wild Wild West: The Complete Series(as a Mexican bandido), Jock Mahoney, Adam West ofBatman: The Movie (Special Edition), Arthur Hunnicutt, Lyle Bettger, Ellen Corby, Warren Oates, Harry Carey Jr., Russell Johnson, Dick Foran, John Lupton, Jack Elam, Elisha Cook, Jr., Paul Fix, even James Coburn and Charles Bronson.Besides having lost, with Andy and Jonesy, some of its family-friendly flavor, this particular season is marred not only by the usual historical inaccuracies of its era (Laramie as a town having existed for 20 years or more) but by assorted continuity flaws (in one segment the Sherman ranchhouse has an attic, in the next a ladder leading to a trapdoor in the roof; the local sheriff is sometimes Mort Corey, sometimes someone else, and played by the same actor only twice until Stuart Randall finally takes over the role permanently about midway through) and at least one major improbability (a Christmas-Eve attack on the ranch by Sioux Indians, who not only come in numbers much larger than they really need to--at one point there are at least 50 of them on the ridge--but keep trying even after losing at least 10 of their fellows, something Indians would never do unless there was someone at the focus of their attack that they had vowed to kill come hell or high water), besides the minor one of Andy visiting home several times in the fall but not at all for Christmas.  But it's still a tightly-written, action-filled Western populated by interesting characters--both the regulars and the people who move in and out of their lives.",5,Two partners against the world,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,4419,"['second', 'season', 'beloved', 'Western', 'finds', 'ranch', 'owner', 'relay-station', 'operator', 'Slim', 'Sherman', 'John', 'Smith', 'ranchhand', 'friend', 'ex-drifter', 'fast', 'gun', 'Jess', 'Harper', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'batching', 'Slim', 'younger', 'brother', 'Andy', 'Robert', 'Crawford', 'Jr.', 'who', 'make', 'few', 'return', 'appearances', 'often', 'referred', 'dialogue', 'school', 'St.', 'Louis', 'cook/factotum', 'Jonesy', 'ride', 'herd', 'Hoagy', 'Carmichael', 'contract', 'had', 'expired', 'reasons', 'unclear', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'renegotiate', 'basically', 'wrote', 'Andy', 'series', 'relationship', 'easier', 'now', 'sometimes', 'strained', 'unexpected', 'chores', 'added', 'connected', 'range', 'work', 'stagecoaches', 'Jess', 'temper', 'still', 'short-and-explosive', 'variety', 'less', 'inclined', 'take', 'off', 'old', 'obligation', 'something', 'unpleasant', 'past', 'catching', 'up', 'less-than-stellar', 'past', ""n't"", 'intrude', 'new', 'life', 'often', 'season', 'last', 'fact', 'one', 'point', 'kidnapped', 'way', 'Utah', 'lead', 'way', 'hidden', 'cache', 'stolen', 'coin', 'segment', 'arrested', 'Colorado', 'lawman', 'unsavory', 'reputation', 'murder', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'Slim', 'deputized', 'rides', 'make', 'sure', 'Jess', ""n't"", 'come', 'down', 'case', 'lead', 'back', 'Jess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Slim', 'wo', ""n't"", 'gang', 'up', 'man', 'time', 'used', 'bait', 'force', 'Slim', 'hand', 'Slim', 'be', 'shot', 'ultimatum', ""'ll"", 'least', 'have', 'chance', 'defend', 'where', 'Jess', 'will', 'be', 'hanged', ""n't"", 'go', 'Jess', 'never', 'friend', 'will', 'come', 'Meanwhile', 'Slim', 'again', 'devotion', 'what', 'right', 'prejudices', 'neighbors', 'when', 'get', 'cattleman', 'put', 'trial', 'murder', 'connection', 'death', 'Indian', 'working', 'Sherman', 'Ranch', 'way', 'also', 'learn', 'something', 'Slim', 'family', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'who', 'was', 'terrible', 'liar', 'long-standing', 'feud', 'family', 'regular', 'stock', 'company', 'guest', 'stars', 'begun', 'develop', 'such', 'names', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'Jocelyn', 'Brando', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'John', 'Anderson', 'L.', 'Q.', 'Jones', 'Rod', 'Cameron', 'William', 'Bryant', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'last', 'four', 'twice', 'James', 'Anderson', 'three', 'times', 'returning', 'First', 'Season', 'others', 'Robert', 'J.', 'Wilkie', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'R.', 'G.', 'Armstrong', 'Harry', 'Lauter', 'Roy', 'Barcroft', 'Gregory', 'Walcott', 'making', 'repeat', 'appearances', 'last', 'three', 'times', 'others', 'twice', 'John', 'McIntire', 'Denny/Scott', 'Miller', 'whom', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'was', 'later', 'work', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'also', 'appear', 'do', 'Steve', 'McNally', 'bad', 'brother', 'inWinchester', ""'73"", 'Claude', 'Akins', 'Harold', 'J', 'Stone', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'Robert', 'Vaughan', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'ofThe', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Mexican', 'bandido', 'Jock', 'Mahoney', 'Adam', 'West', 'ofBatman', 'Movie', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Arthur', 'Hunnicutt', 'Lyle', 'Bettger', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'Russell', 'Johnson', 'Dick', 'Foran', 'John', 'Lupton', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'Elisha', 'Cook', 'Jr.', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'even', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Charles', 'Bronson.Besides', 'having', 'lost', 'Andy', 'Jonesy', 'family-friendly', 'flavor', 'particular', 'season', 'marred', 'not', 'only', 'usual', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'era', 'Laramie', 'town', 'having', 'existed', '20', 'years', 'more', 'assorted', 'continuity', 'flaws', 'one', 'segment', 'Sherman', 'ranchhouse', 'attic', 'next', 'ladder', 'leading', 'trapdoor', 'roof', 'local', 'sheriff', 'sometimes', 'Mort', 'Corey', 'sometimes', 'someone', 'else', 'played', 'same', 'actor', 'only', 'twice', 'Stuart', 'Randall', 'finally', 'role', 'permanently', 'midway', 'least', 'one', 'major', 'improbability', 'Christmas-Eve', 'attack', 'ranch', 'Sioux', 'Indians', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'come', 'numbers', 'much', 'larger', 'really', 'need', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'least', '50', 'ridge', 'keep', 'trying', 'even', 'losing', 'least', '10', 'fellows', 'something', 'Indians', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'was', 'someone', 'focus', 'attack', 'had', 'vowed', 'kill', 'come', 'hell', 'high', 'water', 'minor', 'one', 'Andy', 'visiting', 'home', 'several', 'times', 'fall', 'not', 'Christmas', 'still', 'tightly-written', 'action-filled', 'Western', 'populated', 'interesting', 'characters', 'regulars', 'people', 'who', 'move', 'lives']",Laramie: Season 2

1509258,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B0064CT90U,Gary P. Cohen,"[0, 0]","I grew up during the height of the TV western.  I watched and loved almost every western on TV but, for some reason, I never watched Laramie.  (Part of the reason might have been that for a year or two, Laramie was on the same time as Combat, a series I watched religiously.)Anyway, even though I had no specific memories of this series, I thought I would give it a try.  And I'm glad I did because it was a well-produced and excellent western.  Like so many series of that period, it featured many great guest stars (most not mentioned on the back of the box.)  One episode featured the great Ernest Borgnine, then still a major movie star.  Another episode featured Charles Bronson (and an unbilled Richard Kiel.)  James Coburn appeared in an excellent  Christmasy episode as the series leads, John Smith and Robert Fuller, Coburn and several others are trapped in a farmhouse surrounded by a small army of villains waiting to kill them.  An excellent episode, along with many others I've watched. (Since this series was filmed at Universal, Alfred Hitchcock's &#34; Psycho&#34; house also makes an appearance in two episodes.)Like most sets released by Timeless, the quality varies.  Most of the episodes are okay, but I did run across one that was completely unwatchable.  Also in the set is a very nice retrospective on the life (and sad death) of series lead, John Smith.  This is very well done.In conclusion, I'm happy I picked up this set.  I'm only surprised that I did not run into this series a lot sooner.

One of those poor channels broadcast Laramie.  I was frustrated in attempting to discern what was going on a very fuzzy tv screen.  So now well into my middle age I can finally watch, in great digital remastered format, those Laramie episodes I missed out on way back in my youth.Whether it is watching Wagon Train or Rawhide or Laramie I believe that compared to modern television the story telling was fresh and less predictable other than the fact the stars of the series would come through each adventure victorius.  These old westerns remind of my introduction to the world of drama.

It actually opened up a new direction for Robert Fuller to venture into and showcase his talent (he once stated he wished he had been born a cowboy coming out of New York State(!)) as a physical actor. The same talent would be seen in the color 90 minute season of Wagon Train when he portrayed Cooper Smith, a similar mode to Jess Harper. No, I have not purchased this set as yet, but have copies from a collector off-air syndication, not excellent quality but tolerable. Once you watch this action-packed season, the first color season loses quality but it shows an improvement over the premiere year.
