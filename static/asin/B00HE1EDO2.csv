1688050,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00HE1EDO2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Sometimes, when you have such a dramatic high, the world expects too much of you to the point where nothing you put out, even the good stuff, is met with this glance of disapproval and disappointment because it just isn&#8217;t what everyone expected.  Lofty expectations can be a killer, to both the audience and the filmmaker.  A lot was made of Asghar Farhadi&#8217;s follow-up to the sensational Oscar winner, &#8216;A Separation&#8217;.  I know that it was high on my &#8216;must see&#8217; list, and everything about the film, including the mystery surrounding the plot, had me all in.I couldn&#8217;t wait for this!Sadly, I missed this in the theater (or is it a sad thing?) and so I had to wait for the DVD to drop, but once it did I snatched it up and settled in the other night to take in what I expected to be sheer greatness.I was left scratching my head a bit, completely disappointed in this film and wondering if it was because I expected too much or because the film just simply isn&#8217;t very good.I&#8217;ve settled on the later.Here&#8217;s my deal; where much of &#8216;A Separation&#8217; felt shrouded in this mystery that served a greater purpose and left us with a resolve that felt so grounded in a realism made identifiable (and lasting), &#8216;The Past&#8217; just feels mysterious for the sake of giving us something to try and pay attention to, and when all is revealed we&#8217;re left with an emptiness, simply because the mystery becomes anticlimactic and unrewarding.  It doesn&#8217;t help that the conclusion feels so abrupt and untruthful, and this has a lot to do with the fact that the film spends two hours doing practically nothing, when it should have been developing these characters.When all is said and done, everyone feels so one-dimensional.The film tells the story of a couple finalizing their divorce.  In the wake of this, the wife, Marie, has taken up with a married man, Samir, whose wife has attempted suicide and lies in the hospital in a coma.  Marie exchanges men every few years, and so she has two daughters from two different men (neither of which is her husband, Ahmad, or her current lover) and because of this her eldest daughter, Lucie, resents her and causes her grief by staying out all night and bickering with her.  Lucie is also harboring a secret, but I won&#8217;t touch that.  The lives of these four people are interwoven and ultimately come crashing into one another when Ahmad takes it upon himself to uncover secrets and fix problems and then abruptly wash his hands of it all and leave.Thanks for that.The real issue is that nothing feels developed past a concept.  Like, Marie hops around but why?  Nothing is really explored and so she becomes a very despicable woman and a selfish one at that, and yet I think there is supposed to be something deeper here.  Samir is basically a soulless cypher who causes trouble with his appearance but really has no deeper purpose.  We don&#8217;t get to know him outside of a few tiffs he has with Marie and so his character becomes a forgettable one, to the point where his final decisions feel weakly inserted into the film.  Ahmad and Lucie get a little more development, and Pauline Burlet (who looks just like Marion Cotillard) delivers a very sincere and honest performance, but her arc was just so unmoving.  I didn&#8217;t really care, and I needed to care for it to make any sort of impact.Like, I waited this long&#8230;for this?And the constant back and forth of &#8216;is she lying/is there more/one more secret/someone else is lying/oh you&#8217;re telling the truth&#8217; was redundant and took away from the storytelling.But the acting was solid, if a bit stagnant in parts (and Bejo was uniformly unremarkable and didn&#8217;t deserve that Cannes Award at all), but the kids clearly outshined the adults in every way.  I find it fascinating to know that Cotillard was initially cast as Marie (makes perfect sense considering Burlet played the daughter) and I wonder how much better the film would have been had she been cast, but then again, the real issues here were in the script and so I&#8217;m glad she didn&#8217;t tarnish her increasingly remarkable resume with this film.",3,That's all?,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,4214,"['Sometimes', 'when', 'have', 'dramatic', 'high', 'world', 'too', 'much', 'point', 'where', 'nothing', 'put', 'out', 'even', 'good', 'stuff', 'met', 'glance', 'disapproval', 'disappointment', 'just', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'what', 'everyone', 'expected', 'Lofty', 'expectations', 'can', 'be', 'killer', 'audience', 'filmmaker', 'lot', 'was', 'made', 'Asghar', 'Farhadi', '8217', 'follow-up', 'sensational', 'Oscar', 'winner', '8216', 'A', 'Separation', '8217', 'know', 'was', 'high', '8216', 'must', 'see', '8217', 'list', 'everything', 'film', 'including', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'plot', 'had', 'in.I', 'couldn', '8217', 'wait', 'Sadly', 'missed', 'theater', 'sad', 'thing', 'so', 'had', 'wait', 'DVD', 'drop', 'did', 'snatched', 'up', 'settled', 'other', 'night', 'take', 'what', 'expected', 'be', 'sheer', 'greatness.I', 'was', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'bit', 'completely', 'disappointed', 'film', 'wondering', 'was', 'because', 'expected', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'just', 'simply', 'isn', '8217', 'very', 'good.I', '8217', 've', 'settled', 'later.Here', '8217', 's', 'deal', 'where', 'much', '8216', 'A', 'Separation', '8217', 'felt', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'served', 'greater', 'purpose', 'left', 'resolve', 'felt', 'so', 'grounded', 'realism', 'made', 'identifiable', 'lasting', '8216', 'Past', '8217', 'just', 'feels', 'mysterious', 'sake', 'giving', 'something', 'try', 'pay', 'attention', 'when', 'revealed', '8217', 're', 'left', 'emptiness', 'simply', 'mystery', 'anticlimactic', 'unrewarding', '8217', 'help', 'conclusion', 'feels', 'so', 'abrupt', 'untruthful', 'lot', 'do', 'fact', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'doing', 'practically', 'nothing', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'developing', 'characters.When', 'said', 'done', 'everyone', 'feels', 'so', 'one-dimensional.The', 'film', 'story', 'couple', 'finalizing', 'divorce', 'wake', 'wife', 'Marie', 'taken', 'up', 'married', 'man', 'Samir', 'wife', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'hospital', 'coma', 'Marie', 'exchanges', 'men', 'few', 'years', 'so', 'two', 'daughters', 'two', 'different', 'men', 'husband', 'Ahmad', 'current', 'lover', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Lucie', 'grief', 'staying', 'out', 'night', 'bickering', 'Lucie', 'also', 'harboring', 'secret', 'won', '8217', 'touch', 'lives', 'four', 'people', 'are', 'interwoven', 'ultimately', 'come', 'crashing', 'one', 'when', 'Ahmad', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'fix', 'problems', 'then', 'abruptly', 'wash', 'hands', 'leave.Thanks', 'that.The', 'real', 'issue', 'nothing', 'feels', 'developed', 'concept', 'Marie', 'why', 'Nothing', 'really', 'explored', 'so', 'very', 'despicable', 'woman', 'selfish', 'one', 'yet', 'think', 'supposed', 'be', 'something', 'deeper', 'here', 'Samir', 'basically', 'soulless', 'cypher', 'who', 'trouble', 'appearance', 'really', 'deeper', 'purpose', 'don', '8217', 'get', 'know', 'few', 'tiffs', 'Marie', 'so', 'character', 'forgettable', 'one', 'point', 'where', 'final', 'decisions', 'feel', 'weakly', 'inserted', 'film', 'Ahmad', 'Lucie', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'development', 'Pauline', 'Burlet', 'who', 'just', 'like', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'very', 'sincere', 'honest', 'performance', 'arc', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'unmoving', 'didn', '8217', 'really', 'care', 'needed', 'care', 'make', 'sort', 'impact.Like', 'waited', 'long', '8230', 'constant', 'back', 'forth', '8216', 'lying/is', 'more/one', 'more', 'secret/someone', 'else', 'lying/oh', '8217', 're', 'telling', 'truth', '8217', 'was', 'redundant', 'took', 'away', 'storytelling.But', 'acting', 'was', 'solid', 'bit', 'stagnant', 'parts', 'Bejo', 'was', 'uniformly', 'unremarkable', 'didn', '8217', 'deserve', 'Cannes', 'Award', 'kids', 'clearly', 'outshined', 'adults', 'way', 'find', 'fascinating', 'know', 'Cotillard', 'was', 'initially', 'cast', 'Marie', 'perfect', 'sense', 'considering', 'Burlet', 'played', 'daughter', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'then', 'again', 'real', 'issues', 'here', 'were', 'script', 'so', '8217', 'glad', 'didn', '8217', 'tarnish', 'increasingly', 'remarkable', 'resume', 'film']",The Past
1688051,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00HE1EDO2,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","Iranian writer/director Asghar Farhadi has hit the mark again with THE PAST - a film equal to if not superior to his Oscar winning A SEPARATION. Why this brilliant movie was not nominated for an Oscar is a serious conundrum. Farhadi demonstrates further that his ability to dissect family interactions and question ethical behavior among his characters is unmatched.Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa), an Iranian man deserted his French wife and her two children to return to his homeland, returns to Paris four years later at his wife's request: his wife Marie (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo) is in a new relationship with an Arab man, the dry cleaners' owner Samir (Tahar Rahim), a reality her husband confronts upon his wife's request for a divorce. Coming back to accomplish the divorce procedure, Ahmad arrives in Paris to meet his ex-wife and her daughters - 16 year old Lucie (Pauline Burlet) and the very young L&eacute;a (Jeanne Jestin) from her previous marriage - only to discover that Lucie has defensive behavior and resents the fact that Samir and his young son Fouad (Elyes Aguis) are living in her home. Marie pleads with Ahmad to speak with Lucie to assess and correct her bizarre behavior (both of Marie's children relate well to the warmly tender and understanding Ahmad, despite his unexpected absence form their family for four years). Ahmad discovers that Samir is still married - his wife is in a coma for the past eight months due to a suicide attempt - and Lucie's behavior, superficially because she blames Marie's and Samir's affair as the cause of Samir's wife's suicide, makes living in the same house with Marie and Samir intolerable. The interaction between Ahmad and Marie, Ahmad and Samir, and Ahmad and the three children gradually discloses the mystery behind Samir's reason for suicide - an exploration that includes confrontation with Samir's faithful illegal employee Nama (Sabrina Ouazani) and a secret Lucie has been stifling. The manner in which Marie relates to her former husband Ahmad, her fianc&eacute; Samir (by whom she is pregnant) and the unresolved question of whether Samir's wife will remain in a coma or awaken drives this story to an end that is for the most part left up to the viewer to decide.The entire cast is excellent, the cinematography by Mahmoud Kalari, the musical score by Evgueni and Youli Galperine and the writing and direction by Farhadi are exemplary. This is a tough ultimately brilliant work that deserves a very wide audience. Highly Recommended.

1688053,A3485K2A3Q814Z,B00HE1EDO2,Lemons,"[4, 4]","This Golden Globe nominee was sadly ignored as an Oscar contender. Iranian director Asghar Farhadi directs this complex, multi-layered production with sensitivity and insight, which deserves a nod. Berenice Bejo won Best Actress at Cannes.Ahmad (Ali Moutaffa) returns to Paris from Iran to finalize his divorce from Marie (Berenice Bejo), who is in a relationship with another Iranian man, Samir (Tahar Rahim). Ahmad is fond of Marie's daughters from a previous marriage, particularly Lucie (Pauline Burlet) the older daughter. He has an easy way with children generally, trying to connect with Samir's troubled son Fouad (Elyes Aguis), who lives with them. Lea (Jeanne Jestin), the younger daughter's character is peripheral.Ahmad quickly becomes embroiled in Marie's dysfunctional domestic dynamic, coerced into acting as mediator between mother and daughter. Lucie does not approve of Marie's relationship with Samir (no spoilers here) and starts to act out.Marie is not really concerned for her children - she comes first. It is apparent that while none of the children are Ahmad's, he is by far the better parent. Marie's request for Ahmed to be present for the divorce to be finalized is a thinly veiled appeal for assistance, as her life unravels.However, Marie's apparent feistiness belies a deep vulnerability. The two gentle men in her life are stronger by far than she is. She is the perfect foil for them to prove their worth, but we feel for her too, even though she is initially unlikeable.The ending is somewhat unresolved - it is up to the viewer to decide.Asghar Farhadi's expert touch and impressive resume (A Separation won  Best Foreign Language Film at the 2012 Academy Awards) make this movie memorable.",4,Superbly intimate account of fallibility,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,1725,"['Golden', 'Globe', 'nominee', 'was', 'sadly', 'ignored', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'Iranian', 'director', 'Asghar', 'Farhadi', 'complex', 'multi-layered', 'production', 'sensitivity', 'insight', 'nod', 'Berenice', 'Bejo', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Cannes.Ahmad', 'Ali', 'Moutaffa', 'Paris', 'Iran', 'finalize', 'divorce', 'Marie', 'Berenice', 'Bejo', 'who', 'relationship', 'Iranian', 'man', 'Samir', 'Tahar', 'Rahim', 'Ahmad', 'fond', 'Marie', 'daughters', 'previous', 'marriage', 'particularly', 'Lucie', 'Pauline', 'Burlet', 'older', 'daughter', 'easy', 'way', 'children', 'generally', 'trying', 'connect', 'Samir', 'troubled', 'son', 'Fouad', 'Elyes', 'Aguis', 'who', 'Lea', 'Jeanne', 'Jestin', 'younger', 'daughter', 'character', 'peripheral.Ahmad', 'quickly', 'embroiled', 'Marie', 'dysfunctional', 'domestic', 'dynamic', 'coerced', 'acting', 'mediator', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Lucie', 'not', 'approve', 'Marie', 'relationship', 'Samir', 'spoilers', 'here', 'act', 'out.Marie', 'not', 'really', 'concerned', 'children', 'first', 'apparent', 'none', 'children', 'are', 'Ahmad', 'far', 'better', 'parent', 'Marie', 'request', 'Ahmed', 'be', 'present', 'divorce', 'be', 'finalized', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'appeal', 'assistance', 'life', 'unravels.However', 'Marie', 'apparent', 'feistiness', 'deep', 'vulnerability', 'two', 'gentle', 'men', 'life', 'are', 'stronger', 'far', 'perfect', 'foil', 'prove', 'worth', 'feel', 'too', 'even', 'initially', 'unlikeable.The', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'unresolved', 'viewer', 'decide.Asghar', 'Farhadi', 'expert', 'touch', 'impressive', 'resume', 'Separation', 'won', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', '2012', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'make', 'movie', 'memorable']",The Past
1688054,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00HE1EDO2,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","There may be spoilers.As a fan of 2011's Oscar winning foreign language film, ""A Separation,"" I was eager to see director Asghar Farhadi's follow-up. Like his previous film, ""The Past (Le pass&eacute;)"" deals with family matters of a similar nature.Set in a non-descript section of Paris, Iranian national Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) is returning from Tehran after 4 years to sign divorce papers with his estranged wife Marie (Berenice Bejo). Surprisingly she has offered him accommodations at her (and his former) house rather than get a hotel. Their reunion restarts squabbles and bickering that remind each of why their marriage fell apart.Although they never had children together, Ahmad was stepfather to Lucie (Pauline Burlet), now 16 and defiant of her mother. There is also a younger sister of about 8. A young boy of about 9 named Fouad (Elyes Aguis) is also living there. He is the son of an Arab named Samir (Tahar Rahim) and both are currently living with Marie. This arrangement and Ahmad's invite certainly seems a bit awkward at best, but Ahmad goes along with it. Especially after Marie asks him to find out what is bothering Lucie. Why she stays out until late at night, skips school and rebels against Marie?Complicating matters further, Samir is still married. But his wife is in a coma as the result of a suicide attempt. The why is the central theme of the film. But this is more than a boilerplate drama. There is tension and more than a little bit of mystery as the film plays out. As Ahmad says several times during the movie, it's all a misunderstanding.For me, the story is more about the children than it is about the adults. Their actions have serious ramifications on the kids and Farhadi isn't shy about exposing that element. The kids aren't there just because they are part of the family; they have their own personalities and crosses to bear. Shot frequently with hand held cameras, the photography feels at times like we're watching a documentary and I think that is the idea. The film runs a tad long, but is certainly a compelling film. The actors are truly excellent and that includes some remarkable performances from the younger ones. See it.The Blu ray transfer is as good as the film.  Using a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and video resolution of 1080p, the look is perfect.  It was a bit startling to see the life like colors, the fine detail, the exquisite clarity and sharpness of the surroundings.  Facial tone is excellent.  This is a Blu ray showpiece.  Likewise the excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is superb.  This is an immersive French language film (English and English SDH subtitles) and couldn't be better.  The surrounds are in play much of the time but not so that they are noticeable.  Traffic, city sounds, etc. are excellent regardless of the setting.  Extras include a commentary track by the director, a ""making of"" short, a Q & A session with Farhadi, a trailer and some previews from Sony.",5,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 4 1/2 stars for a family drama with some real life mystery,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,2936,"['may', 'be', 'spoilers.As', 'fan', '2011', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'Separation', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'director', 'Asghar', 'Farhadi', 'follow-up', 'previous', 'film', 'Past', 'Le', 'pass', 'eacute', 'deals', 'family', 'matters', 'similar', 'nature.Set', 'non-descript', 'section', 'Paris', 'Iranian', 'national', 'Ahmad', 'Ali', 'Mosaffa', 'returning', 'Tehran', '4', 'years', 'sign', 'divorce', 'papers', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Marie', 'Berenice', 'Bejo', 'Surprisingly', 'offered', 'accommodations', 'former', 'house', 'rather', 'get', 'hotel', 'reunion', 'restarts', 'squabbles', 'bickering', 'why', 'marriage', 'fell', 'never', 'had', 'children', 'together', 'Ahmad', 'was', 'stepfather', 'Lucie', 'Pauline', 'Burlet', 'now', '16', 'defiant', 'mother', 'also', 'younger', 'sister', '8', 'young', 'boy', '9', 'named', 'Fouad', 'Elyes', 'Aguis', 'also', 'living', 'there', 'son', 'Arab', 'named', 'Samir', 'Tahar', 'Rahim', 'are', 'currently', 'living', 'Marie', 'arrangement', 'Ahmad', 'invite', 'certainly', 'bit', 'awkward', 'best', 'Ahmad', 'along', 'Especially', 'Marie', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'bothering', 'Lucie', 'Why', 'out', 'late', 'night', 'skips', 'school', 'rebels', 'Marie', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'further', 'Samir', 'still', 'married', 'wife', 'coma', 'result', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'why', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'more', 'boilerplate', 'drama', 'tension', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'mystery', 'film', 'out', 'Ahmad', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'misunderstanding.For', 'story', 'more', 'children', 'adults', 'actions', 'have', 'serious', 'ramifications', 'kids', 'Farhadi', ""n't"", 'shy', 'exposing', 'element', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'just', 'are', 'part', 'family', 'have', 'own', 'personalities', 'crosses', 'bear', 'Shot', 'frequently', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'photography', 'feels', 'times', ""'re"", 'watching', 'documentary', 'think', 'idea', 'film', 'tad', 'long', 'certainly', 'compelling', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'truly', 'excellent', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'younger', 'ones', 'See', 'it.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'Using', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'video', 'resolution', '1080p', 'look', 'perfect', 'was', 'bit', 'startling', 'see', 'life', 'colors', 'fine', 'detail', 'exquisite', 'clarity', 'sharpness', 'surroundings', 'Facial', 'tone', 'excellent', 'Blu', 'ray', 'showpiece', 'Likewise', 'excellent', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'superb', 'immersive', 'French', 'language', 'film', 'English', 'English', 'SDH', 'subtitles', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'surrounds', 'are', 'play', 'much', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'are', 'noticeable', 'Traffic', 'city', 'sounds', 'etc', 'are', 'excellent', 'regardless', 'setting', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'making', 'short', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'Farhadi', 'trailer', 'previews', 'Sony']",The Past

Lucie is having a very difficult time with her mom Marie, who is in a relationship with Samir, a drycleaner owner whose wife is in a coma and who has a young son. About 45 min. into the movie, Marie and Ahmad meet with the judge who pronounces them officially divorced. What will become of Marie and Ahmed? Will Marie marry Samir? Can Marie and Lucie patch over their difference? And how did Samir's wife actually get onto a coma? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from writer-director Asghar Farhadi, whose previous film, 2011's &#34;A Separation&#34; was fantastic (and won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film). &#34;The Past&#34;, while very different in details and tone, is nevertheless in the same vein as &#34;A Separation&#34;, as both movies document a powerful family and relationship drama. Second, it's not clear whether tit was the director's intent, but the movie shows the problems that can come from &#34;mixed families&#34;, as in: kids from multiple relationship, have a hard time and are never the winners in these relationship dramas. The conflict between Marie and her oldest daughter Lucie is in particular complex yet also compelling to watch (I don't want to go into too many details). Towards the end of the movie, Marie confesses that she desperately wants to move on with her life and leave the past behind, &#34;but what if we can't forget it?&#34;, she laments... Third, there are plenty of stellar acting performances, none more so than B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo as Marie (She won Best Actress at Cannes 2013, where this movie premiered), but Tahar Rahim as Samir and Ali Mosaffa as Ahmad are also outstanding. And what about Pauline Burlet as the troubled 16 yr. old Lucie! Kudos to all of them. What a refreshing movie this is! People having, you know, adult conversations that engage you. What a concept, right? This movie shows once again that you don't need the world blown up to smithereens every 5 minutes to create a powerful and entertaining movie.Ever since this premiered at last year's Cannes festival, to much acclaim and buzz, I had been looking forward to seeing this movie. It finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening I saw this at was not well attended, although that is probably more a reflection of the terrible winter weather than it is of the quality of this movie. Iran submitted this movie in the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Movie category, Given than less than 1% (give or take) of the movie is spoken in Farsi, and the remaining 99% in French, I am not surprised that &#34;The Past&#34; did not get nominated. But that doesn't make it any less of a movie. If you are looking for a top notch quality foreign, conversation-driven movie, you cannot go wrong with this. &#34;The Past&#34; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,4.5 stars...

1688056,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00HE1EDO2,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","A French-Italian-Iranian drama &#8220;The Past&#8221; (&#8220;Le Pass&eacute;&#8221;) is written and directed by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, Oscar winner for his &#8220;A Separation.&#8221;His new film starts out with one symbolic scene at an airport (check out the glass wall). An Iranian Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) has just arrived in France to finalize the divorce procedure with his estranged wife Marie (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo). They have been separated for four years, and for Ahmad, who revisits his old house in Paris suburb, four years is long enough. So many things have changed.But he soon realizes something else. Everyone here seems having hard time. The relationship between Marie and her older daughter Lucie (Pauline Burlet) is unusually strained, as Lucie hates Marie&#8217;s boyfriend Samir (Tahar Rahim). And a quiet man Samir always looks very sad. What happened after Ahmad left for Teheran four years ago?Compared with the director&#8217;s previous films, it must be said, the film&#8217;s result may be rather underwhelming to some. The story about the &#8220;mystery&#8221; keeps us guessing, but it lacks resonance, or the emotional impact that Oscar-winning &#8220;A Separation&#8221; has brought so naturally.Still it is true that Asghar Farhadi is one of the most gifted storytellers in cinema world, giving us rich details about characters and their multi-layered stories of their &#8220;past.&#8221; Maybe this is not as great as &#8220;A Separation,&#8221; but still is good.",4,"(3.5 STARS) Journey to the Past: Drama from the Director of ""A Separation""",1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,1509,"['French-Italian-Iranian', 'drama', '8220', 'Past', '8221', '8220', 'Le', 'Pass', 'eacute', '8221', 'written', 'directed', 'Iranian', 'director', 'Asghar', 'Farhadi', 'Oscar', 'winner', '8220', 'A', 'Separation.', '8221', 'new', 'film', 'out', 'one', 'symbolic', 'scene', 'airport', 'check', 'out', 'glass', 'wall', 'Iranian', 'Ahmad', 'Ali', 'Mosaffa', 'just', 'arrived', 'France', 'finalize', 'divorce', 'procedure', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Marie', 'B', 'eacute', 'r', 'eacute', 'nice', 'Bejo', 'have', 'been', 'separated', 'four', 'years', 'Ahmad', 'who', 'old', 'house', 'Paris', 'suburb', 'four', 'years', 'long', 'enough', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'changed.But', 'soon', 'something', 'else', 'Everyone', 'here', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'relationship', 'Marie', 'older', 'daughter', 'Lucie', 'Pauline', 'Burlet', 'unusually', 'strained', 'Lucie', 'Marie', '8217', 'boyfriend', 'Samir', 'Tahar', 'Rahim', 'quiet', 'man', 'Samir', 'always', 'very', 'sad', 'What', 'happened', 'Ahmad', 'left', 'Teheran', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'Compared', 'director', '8217', 'previous', 'films', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'film', '8217', 'result', 'may', 'be', 'rather', 'underwhelming', 'story', '8220', 'mystery', '8221', 'guessing', 'resonance', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Oscar-winning', '8220', 'A', 'Separation', '8221', 'brought', 'so', 'naturally.Still', 'true', 'Asghar', 'Farhadi', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'storytellers', 'cinema', 'world', 'giving', 'rich', 'details', 'characters', 'multi-layered', 'stories', '8220', '8221', 'Maybe', 'not', 'as', 'great', '8220', 'Separation', '8221', 'still', 'good']",The Past
