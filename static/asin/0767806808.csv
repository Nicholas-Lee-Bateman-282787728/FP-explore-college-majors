8507,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767806808,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Michael Keaton is somewhat of an acquired taste.  He is funny sometimes, even outright hysterical (take `Beetlejuice' for instance) but other times he just wares on my patience.  `Multiplicity' is one of those films that works in parts, but not entirely, and that is mostly due to Keaton's uneven performance.  Well, and the fact that Andie MacDowell didn't have any strong direction to squeeze goodness out of her.The script is also rather ridiculous, but I think we expect that from a film like this.Keaton plays Doug Kinney, a construction worker who has a wife and two kids and absolutely no time to spend with them.  His wife wants to go back to work but there is just no way that Doug can fit it into his schedule to help out around the house.  That is until this Dr. confronts him about cloning.  Doug is apposed and then all for it and before you know it there is another Doug (called #2) who is living above the garage.  Now Doug can spend time with his kids while #2 goes to work.  Then Doug realizes that he is so busy at home he has no time for himself and so we get #3, the sensitive stay at home Doug who takes care of the house and the children while Doug is playing golf.  But when things get too much for #2 and #3 to handle they take it upon themselves to bring home #4 and it's about then that everything starts to fall apart.The film could have had a better outcome had the premise been treated with a little more respect.  Instead, director Harold Ramis and writer Chris Miller went for the slapstick, easy gags.  The film is rather brainless.Michael Keaton is pretty good as Doug, and I liked the way he played off the sensitive side of #3, but his take on #2 was kind of obnoxious and his mimicry of Steve Martin's hilarious turn in `Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' was rather unnecessary and ridiculous (notice how #4 refers to everyone as Steve...not a coincidence I guaranty you).  Andie MacDowell, as I have mentioned before, is usually boring and dull.  In fact, it takes a really strong and influential director to bring out the good in her (great in her is you take into account her work with Altman and Soderbergh) and Ramis is not a strong director.In other words; she's dreadful here.The film has its funny moments but the lack of natural charm and any real comedic weight make this film more of a dud than a hit.  I wish that I could say something better for the film.  My wife loves it.  I on the other hand do not.  I give it a low C.",3,A rather insipid take on a somewhat engaging subject...,1227139200,"11 20, 2008",2008,2463,"['Michael', 'Keaton', 'somewhat', 'acquired', 'taste', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'even', 'outright', 'hysterical', 'take', 'Beetlejuice', 'instance', 'other', 'times', 'just', 'patience', 'Multiplicity', 'one', 'films', 'parts', 'not', 'entirely', 'mostly', 'due', 'Keaton', 'uneven', 'performance', 'Well', 'fact', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'strong', 'direction', 'squeeze', 'goodness', 'her.The', 'script', 'also', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'think', 'expect', 'film', 'this.Keaton', 'plays', 'Doug', 'Kinney', 'construction', 'worker', 'who', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'absolutely', 'time', 'spend', 'wife', 'go', 'back', 'work', 'just', 'way', 'Doug', 'can', 'fit', 'schedule', 'help', 'out', 'house', 'Dr.', 'cloning', 'Doug', 'apposed', 'then', 'know', 'Doug', 'called', '2', 'who', 'living', 'garage', 'Now', 'Doug', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'kids', '2', 'work', 'Then', 'Doug', 'so', 'busy', 'home', 'time', 'so', 'get', '3', 'sensitive', 'stay', 'home', 'Doug', 'who', 'care', 'house', 'children', 'Doug', 'playing', 'golf', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'much', '2', '3', 'handle', 'take', 'upon', 'bring', 'home', '4', 'then', 'everything', 'fall', 'apart.The', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'outcome', 'had', 'premise', 'been', 'treated', 'little', 'more', 'respect', 'Instead', 'director', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'writer', 'Chris', 'Miller', 'went', 'slapstick', 'easy', 'gags', 'film', 'rather', 'brainless.Michael', 'Keaton', 'pretty', 'good', 'Doug', 'liked', 'way', 'played', 'off', 'sensitive', 'side', '3', 'take', '2', 'was', 'kind', 'obnoxious', 'mimicry', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'hilarious', 'turn', 'Dirty', 'Rotten', 'Scoundrels', 'was', 'rather', 'unnecessary', 'ridiculous', 'notice', 'how', '4', 'refers', 'everyone', 'Steve', 'not', 'coincidence', 'guaranty', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'have', 'mentioned', 'usually', 'boring', 'dull', 'fact', 'really', 'strong', 'influential', 'director', 'bring', 'out', 'good', 'great', 'take', 'account', 'work', 'Altman', 'Soderbergh', 'Ramis', 'not', 'strong', 'director.In', 'other', 'words', 'dreadful', 'here.The', 'film', 'funny', 'moments', 'lack', 'natural', 'charm', 'real', 'comedic', 'weight', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'dud', 'hit', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'something', 'better', 'film', 'wife', 'other', 'hand', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'low', 'C']",N/A

There just aren't enough hours in the day.---------------Ted: We'll have to put in more hours. This isn't just a nine-to-five job. There is a saying where I worked last. ""If you don't come in on Saturday, don't bother coming in on Sunday.""========================One (or two, as it turns out) of his clients offers a solution. Cloning. Did you ever wish you could be in two places at once, like, have your clone go to work while you sat around eating pizza and watching TV? He goes for it, and his clone, a gung ho workaholic, starts going to his job early and staying late. He fires Vic (Eugene Levy), the undependable sub contractor from Dependeble (sic) Concrete (how dependable can you be when you misspell dependable in your own company name?); and without the distractions of a home life, whips his job into shape.Meanwhile, Doug tries becoming a stay-at-home husband, while his wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) returns to her career in Real Estate. Taking care of the house and kids is not as easy as he thought it would be, so he gets another clone. While Doug #2 was a leaner, meaner version of himself, #3 expresses his feminine, nurturing side. But even with 2 clones, they still need more help.----------------Doug Kinney #2: My life's a shambles. I need pie.==========================They decide to make another clone, only this one, a clone of a clone, doesn't turn out so well.----------------Doug Kinney #3: You know how when you make a copy of a copy, it's not as sharp as... well... the original.=============================If this was a remake of another film, this would be a great opportunity for a clever put down--but it's an original idea based on a short story by Chris Miller, who also wrote the screenplay. In fact, my criticism of this movie is not that it's derivative, but rather, it takes a great idea with the perfect cast, and doesn't quite live up to its potential. Michael Keaton, playing 4 distinct versions of Doug Kinney could have really cleaned up with this role, but he failed to rise above the benchmark set by Jim Varney in Ernest Goes to Jail (1990). In this classic Varney plays not only Ernest P. Worrell but also hardened criminal Mr. Felix Nash, as well as Auntie Nelda. Talk about your importance of being Ernest.As anyone who has seen Michael Keaton's work in Night Shift (1982), Beetle Juice (1988), or Speechless (1994) can tell you, there is no one quite like him. That's why the notion of cloning him is so intriguing, yet so disappointing. Somehow it is just not as funny as you thought it would be. The other aspect of the story, a philosophical rumination on time, life, and what really matters, also fizzles out. Multiplicity did leave me pondering such matters, but mostly I wondered whether Keaton received a quadruple salary for his quadruple role.SELECTED FILM ROLES OF MICHAEL KEATONSpeechless(1994) ....

How can you be in two places at once, and where do you get that extra pair of hands you need so desperately to stay afloat?  One man finds the answers  in ""Multiplicity,"" a comedy from director Harold Ramis.  Doug Kinney  (Michael Keaton) owns a construction company, but finds the demands of the  job as well as the needs of his family (a wife and two kids) are just  stretching him too thin.  On a job doing some additions to a laboratory one  day, Doug begins to lose it; his temper flares and he's at his wit's end,  all of which is noticed by a certain Dr. Leeds (Harris Yulin), a scientist,  who offers him a solution to his problems.  It involves a project with  which the lab has already had some success:  cloning.  And once Doug is  convinced it can be done safely, he goes for it, and to his astonishment,  it works.  He ends up with a duplicate of himself; finally he will be able  to get some time off.  Or so he thinks.  His clone quickly finds himself  swamped with work, even with Doug's help (they manage to keep the identity  of the clone a secret, of course), and decides that he, too, needs a clone.  But it doesn't stop there.  Before it's over, Doug finds himself with  three clones; physically identical, but each with a distinctly individual  personality.  The first is rugged, the Doug ready for any job, any time.  The second is more in touch with his feminine side; he is quite  accomplished and likes to cook.  The third, however, turns out a bit  ""watered-down,"" having lost some resolution, as it were, in the process.  He's a bit slow and just slightly off-center.  He loves pizza, for  instance, and keeps a piece in his wallet ""for later.""  Pretty soon Doug's  wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell) begins to notice some changes in her  husband's behavior.  Of course, she doesn't realize that she's dealing with  one man and three clones.  All of which leads to trouble in paradise, and  some quite humorous situations along the way.  Cleverly handled by  Ramis, this is a funny movie and a veritable showcase for the talented  Keaton, who manages to create a unique personality for each of his  characters.  The scenes in which the four of them are together, and Doug  has to deal with ""himselves,"" are hilarious.  MacDowell does a good job  with Laura, giving her enough vulnerability to enable the audience to  empathize with her frustration at suddenly having to cope with a seemingly  schizophrenic husband.  When she tries to have a serious conversation with  the worst of the clones and asks him, ""What do you want?"" while attempting  to sort out their recent differences, and the reply is ""Pizza!"" it makes  you want to cringe, except that you're laughing too hard.  And there are a  lot of laughs here.  The supporting cast includes Eugene Levy, who adds  some droll humor as Vic, a more than inadequate subcontractor who works for  Doug; Richard Masur (Del), Ann Cusack (Noreen), John de Lancie (Ted),  Judith Kahan (Franny) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Walt).  ""Multiplicity"" is a  highly imaginative comedy that works, and is well presented.  One Michael  Keaton in a movie like this is a treat; and here you get four for the price  of one.

Clone #3 is made to be a more sensitive house husband type of guy when the original Doug becomes overwhelmed with all the home time and decides what he really needs is more leisure time for himself.  And the fourth clone, well, he's made from Doug 2 and as my review title quotes the film ""a copy made from a copy is never quite as sharp"".  Obviously complications arise many having to do with Laura, Doug's lovely wife, played by Andie MacDowell, who remains oblivious to the fact that she actually has four husbands for awhile.

Doug is burning the candle at both ends and looking for more ends to burn. There just aren't enough hours in the day for one man to be contractor, father, husband, provider, and swigger of beer at the hockey game. So Doug dives straight to the core of the problem: that thing about ""one man."" When the chance arises, he clones himself so there can be more Doug to go around. But that Doug doesn't like the hard hours any better, so there's a third. And a fourth ...The plot is silly and formulaic. Good, just formulaic. The real treat in this movie is Michael Keaton. If you look at his movie roles (Batman, Mr. Mom, Beetle Juice, etc, etc), he's never the same twice. He's all over the place. This is his movie. He's there four times, playing one character four ways, with four very different personalities. They move differently, talk differently, inflect differently - the four Keatons really are different. Fer cryin' out loud, Doug4 doesn't even look like Keaton most of the time, but is. This isn't a piece of cinematic art so much as a place for the many Keatons to play together, off the leash.It's good, silly, date-movie fun. It's kid-safe. It's shallow and forgettable. But it's physical humor and fast-change personality gags at their best. If that's what you want, it's howling funny.//wiredweird",4,How much Michael Keaton is there?,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,1402,"['how', 'many', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'nothing', 'answer', 'question.The', 'premise', 'goofy', 'Doug', 'burning', 'candle', 'ends', 'looking', 'more', 'ends', 'burn', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'hours', 'day', 'one', 'man', 'be', 'contractor', 'father', 'husband', 'provider', 'swigger', 'beer', 'hockey', 'game', 'So', 'Doug', 'dives', 'straight', 'core', 'problem', 'thing', 'one', 'man', 'When', 'chance', 'arises', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'Doug', 'go', 'around', 'Doug', ""n't"", 'like', 'hard', 'hours', 'better', 'third', 'fourth', 'plot', 'silly', 'formulaic', 'Good', 'just', 'formulaic', 'real', 'treat', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'look', 'movie', 'roles', 'Batman', 'Mr', 'Mom', 'Beetle', 'Juice', 'etc', 'etc', 'never', 'same', 'twice', 'place', 'movie', 'there', 'four', 'times', 'playing', 'one', 'character', 'four', 'ways', 'four', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'move', 'differently', 'talk', 'differently', 'inflect', 'differently', 'four', 'Keatons', 'really', 'are', 'different', 'Fer', 'cryin', 'out', 'loud', 'Doug4', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'Keaton', 'most', 'time', ""n't"", 'piece', 'cinematic', 'art', 'so', 'much', 'place', 'many', 'Keatons', 'play', 'together', 'off', 'leash.It', 'good', 'silly', 'date-movie', 'fun', 'kid-safe', 'shallow', 'forgettable', 'physical', 'humor', 'fast-change', 'personality', 'gags', 'best', 'what', 'want', 'howling', 'funny.//wiredweird']",N/A
