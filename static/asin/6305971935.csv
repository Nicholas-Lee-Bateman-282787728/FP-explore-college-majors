Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","Nancy Allen herself shines in this movie but I don't think she and Pare had much chemistry together.When this movie came out it was all the rage. Unfortunately it does not hold its own years later. The movie's special effects were average at best. The acting was so-so and the production, while interesting as a whole did not inspire me. I did like the recreations of 1940s America. They shot in the south for areas that were supposed to be Philadelphia. This is the perfect movie to be remade for audiences today.My favorite line in the movie: &#34;I don't know if they have a telephone,&#34; David says. &#34;David, everyone has a telephone,&#34; replies Allison. I liked the ending of the movie. After retuning to 1943 to save the destroyer by turning off the time device, David returns to modern times and falls in love with Allison Hayes. What happens next? I don't know because I have yet to see the sequel.Get this movie on DVD. It's not too bad. Michael Pare does a pretty good job at carrying the film.

485709,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6305971935,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 6]","Michael Pare never really made it to the big time, which is too bad, because I always thought he had what it took to be in the Hollywood big leagues. He was good looking, had that tough guy way of delivering his lines, and this no-nonsense demeanor. Yet, in his scenes, he unveiled a certain sensitivity and accesibility. He proved to me, with his movies, that he could emote well enough. In the 1980s, he starred in several movies which I really enjoyed: STREETS OF FIRE, EDDIE & THE CRUISERS 1 & 2, and THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT.I love time travel stories and I had tremendous fun watching THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT. Supposedly drawn somewhat from true events in World War 2, this sci-fi film tells the tale of a WW2 naval experiment (an attempt to make our ships invisible) gone awry. The USS Eldridge, instead, vanishes, not only optically but physically. At the same time, Navy sailor David Herdeg (Michael Pare), along with his squid buddy Jim, are transported 41 years into the future, to the year 1984. They reappear in Nevada and are immediately attacked. I'll try to curb the spoilers, but I will mention that the experiment which began in 1943 is apparently still ongoing in 1984, and that this begins to influence the meteorological fields, in effect, giving rise to massive, progressively worsening electromagnetic storms, which could threaten the whole planet if left unchecked. David and Jim, with the help of a girl they shanghai, Allison (Nancy Allen), attempt to make sense of things as they continue to evade their pursuers. In the end, it all falls on David Herdeg to make things right. How will it end, and which world will he choose to be in?So, watching this movie from a contemporary 2006 perspective, I couldn't help but notice a certain 1980s cheesiness inherent to this film, as well as the gap in special effects technology from then to now. Yet, there's something still fresh and charming about THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT. Part of it, admittedly, is nostalgia. I remember really liking this movie back then, and I undoubtedly re-screened it thru rose-colored eyeballs. But you can't deny the earnest acting efforts of the cast, especially of Pare and Allen. Pare plays David Herdeg as angry, hard-headed, and understandibly confused, yet his vulnerability is shown in several quiet scenes, as when he discovers the fate of his father and when he was saying farewell to Allison. Nancy Allen is sweetness personified as the trusting, kind-hearted Allison Hayes.Part of the allure of a time travel story is the displaced traveler's reactions to the new realities of the temporal setting in which he finds himself. It was fun watching David and Jim try to fathom the workings of a modern vehicle, a color television, a Coke can, an alarm clock, etc . Not to mention, it must be weird watching a 1940s B actor suddenly as the current president (Reagan). The issue of time paradoxes isn't delved into, as much as barely skimmed. Oh, there are people from the past who encounter David in the future, but it was mostly ado about nothing much. The requisite chase scenes and gun plays are all here, of course.

It was remarkable how crisp the images were.  The DVD has trailer, scene selection, audio options and that's about it.The special effects were very 1980's so you have to overlook that when watching the film.  There's a great sequence where Manfred Mann's ""The Runner"" is used for background music.  And a slight continuity error when the Porsche following (and eventually passing) our heroes disappears from the rear window.  And I have to wonder, since our hero is so important to the military's time travel experiment, why are they shooting at him? (duh!).  Oh well, makes for a little more exciting chase sequences.  And then there's that whole time-space continuum thing, what with the events as they play out.  Oops, better to not think about that stuff! LOLOne of the (1984) scientists shows up in another time-warp movie, ""Groundhog Day.""  See if you can spot him.  Also, one of the main doctors is the U.S. submarine captain from ""Firefox.""  And there's a guy on the hospital elevator that later shows up as a bus passenger in ""Speed.""  Nancy Allen gets the Good Samaritan Award for helping out some guys who steal her car, kidnap her, then her car gets wrecked.

Cayon ""ogam5""","[4, 6]","Not much has ever been noted about research done by New Zealand native and former pilot Bruce Cathie that strongly substantiated the feasibility of what was referred to as both 'Project Invisibility' and, later, 'The Phoenix Project/Project Rainbow'. Cathie, in his eye-opening book Harmonic 695, demonstrated that Einstein had actually COMPLETED his Unified Field Theory and that there was an unmistakable mathematical factor in successful atomic tests also correlating with UFO sightings - so much so that his life has treaded a very, very fine line that neither fellow UFO researcher Dr. Morris K. Jessup (appeared to have committed suicide, but the evidence points to murder) and likely even Nikola Tesla, whose death was in fact under equally mysterious circumstances (it's said by some involved with the project that he was killed for having knowledge of Einstein's reticence concerning application of the UFT and, recognizing just how dangerous the experiment truly was, sabotaged the earliest trials) apparently could walk.In David Hatcher Childress' equally eye-opening book, Anti-Gravity and the Earth Grid, Cathie reviews legendary researcher Ivan T. Sanderson's 'Vile Vortices' as well as geodesic mapping by Buckminster Fuller and the Russians, going on to mathematically prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is a corresponding grid line running exactly between Philadelphia and the Norfolk/Newport News area which would have directly facilitated the event; by virtue of Tesla's groundbreaking work with interference fields and variable pulsed electrical current, the Eldridge and its crew could indeed have been teleported from Philly to Norfolk and back again as purported. As a last note, I can tell you that my own belief this experiment actually occurred was greatly reinforced by a chance conversation with a fellow co-worker some years ago whose father had worked closely with quantum physicist (his wave and matrix mechanics tenets directly related to Tesla's postulations) and master mathematician John Von Neumann (upon whom the movie's Longstreet character is more or less based).

However, the thread of reality helps with the ""what if?"" atmosphere the movie portrays. Among the highlights are a terrific performance by Michael Pare and Nancy Allen, as well as kudos to the casting director for finding actors to portray characters ""then"" and ""now"" who are very believable in their roles. Despite a prerequisite car chase, explosions, and other cliches from movies released during the 1980s, there is a good story here, making this a film well worth your while (the sequel was awful and should only be used as ""Mystery Science Theater"" fodder).

485726,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305971935,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[17, 22]","""The Philadelphia Experiment"" is supposedly the about an experiment the U.S. Navy conducted in 1943 to make the U.S.S. ""Eldridge"" invisible to radar.  However, the experiment goes (surprise) horribly wrong and the ship is contaminated with a deadly dose of radiation.  Two of the sailors, David Herdeg (Michael Pare) and Jim Parker (Bobby Di Cicco), jump overboard as their crewmates are catching on fire and getting trapped in bulkheads and end up traveling through a rift in time to 1984 (i.e., the present in terms of that being the year this movie was made).  One of them gets sent back but the other does not and not only are the authorities after him but it seems that pesky hole in time is wrecking havoc with the climate (not as bad as ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" but serious enough).This is a fun little B-movie that most science fiction fans can enjoy as long as they do not take it too seriously.  The reason it is considered to be based on a ""true"" story is that it is based on a 1979 ""non-fiction"" book that claimed the Navy was fooling around with Einstein's Unified Field Theory and sent the ""Eldridge"" from Philadelphia to the harbor in Norfolk, Virginia, and then back again.  The story is based on some dubious evidence and apparently since the U.S.S. ""Eldridge"" never ever docked at the Philadelphia Naval Yard the title appears to be suspect as well.  The Navy has offered an official explanation that what happened was a routine degaussing of the ship, which meant it was surrounded with electrical cables to negate the magnetic field (the idea is that it would render the ship invisible to radar but not to human eyes).  Of course to some people this explanation just screams cover up.Ultimately this film is not concerned with the ""science"" of the so-called experiment because that is all just an excuse for a more traditional time travel story and within that genre there are few interesting things going on here.  There are some fun moments as Herdeg encounters the brave new world (Orwell's ""1984"" did not come out until 1948, so he does not know that the future is brighter than people had thought in the 1940s).  Herdeg hooks up with an airhead, Allison Hayes (Nancy Allen), who eventually comes to believe that he is not lying about when he is from and tries to help him get back home.  It is just as well because there is really no chemistry between these two.  After ""Eddie & the Cruisers"" and ""Streets of Fire"" we all thought Par' was going to have a career, but this film seems to have derailed it.  Come to think of it the same can be said for Allen, outside of the ""Robocop"" movies.The special effects are rather simplistic, but quite effective for the time.  They were certainly good enough to lure more than a few people into seeing this film from director Stewart Raffill (""The Ice Pirates,"" ""Mac and Me"").  Plus you have the standard lesson than there are some things scientists should not be messing around with otherwise a wormhole will destroy the world as we know it, which was not really an omnipresent science fiction plot line at that point (CGI made destroying the planet much more fun).  There is a 1993 sequel to this film, but try to forget about it because it belongs on everyone's short list of worst science fiction sequels ever.  This one at least gives you some things to think about, not all of which are about how to poke holes in the story.",4,A nice little twisted time travel tale (that is not true),1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,3396,"['Philadelphia', 'Experiment', 'supposedly', 'experiment', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'conducted', '1943', 'make', 'U.S.S', 'Eldridge', 'invisible', 'radar', 'However', 'experiment', 'surprise', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'ship', 'contaminated', 'deadly', 'dose', 'radiation', 'Two', 'sailors', 'David', 'Herdeg', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'Jim', 'Parker', 'Bobby', 'Di', 'Cicco', 'jump', 'overboard', 'crewmates', 'are', 'catching', 'fire', 'getting', 'trapped', 'bulkheads', 'end', 'up', 'traveling', 'rift', 'time', '1984', 'i.e.', 'present', 'terms', 'being', 'year', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'One', 'sent', 'back', 'other', 'not', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'authorities', 'pesky', 'hole', 'time', 'wrecking', 'havoc', 'climate', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'serious', 'enough', '.This', 'fun', 'little', 'B-movie', 'most', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans', 'can', 'enjoy', 'as', 'long', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'reason', 'considered', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'based', '1979', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'claimed', 'Navy', 'was', 'fooling', 'around', 'Einstein', 'Unified', 'Field', 'Theory', 'sent', 'Eldridge', 'Philadelphia', 'harbor', 'Norfolk', 'Virginia', 'then', 'back', 'again', 'story', 'based', 'dubious', 'evidence', 'apparently', 'U.S.S', 'Eldridge', 'never', 'ever', 'docked', 'Philadelphia', 'Naval', 'Yard', 'title', 'be', 'suspect', 'well', 'Navy', 'offered', 'official', 'explanation', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'routine', 'degaussing', 'ship', 'meant', 'was', 'surrounded', 'electrical', 'cables', 'negate', 'magnetic', 'field', 'idea', 'would', 'render', 'ship', 'invisible', 'radar', 'not', 'human', 'eyes', 'course', 'people', 'explanation', 'just', 'screams', 'cover', 'up.Ultimately', 'film', 'not', 'concerned', 'science', 'so-called', 'experiment', 'just', 'excuse', 'more', 'traditional', 'time', 'travel', 'story', 'genre', 'are', 'few', 'interesting', 'things', 'going', 'here', 'are', 'fun', 'moments', 'Herdeg', 'brave', 'new', 'world', 'Orwell', '1984', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'out', '1948', 'not', 'know', 'future', 'brighter', 'people', 'had', 'thought', '1940s', 'Herdeg', 'up', 'airhead', 'Allison', 'Hayes', 'Nancy', 'Allen', 'who', 'eventually', 'believe', 'not', 'lying', 'about', 'when', 'tries', 'help', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'chemistry', 'two', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', 'Streets', 'Fire', 'thought', 'Par', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'career', 'film', 'have', 'derailed', 'Come', 'think', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Allen', 'Robocop', 'movies.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'quite', 'effective', 'time', 'were', 'certainly', 'good', 'enough', 'lure', 'more', 'few', 'people', 'seeing', 'film', 'director', 'Stewart', 'Raffill', 'Ice', 'Pirates', 'Mac', 'Me', 'have', 'standard', 'lesson', 'are', 'things', 'scientists', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'messing', 'otherwise', 'wormhole', 'will', 'destroy', 'world', 'know', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'omnipresent', 'science', 'fiction', 'plot', 'line', 'point', 'CGI', 'made', 'destroying', 'planet', 'much', 'more', 'fun', '1993', 'sequel', 'film', 'try', 'forget', 'everyone', 'short', 'list', 'worst', 'science', 'fiction', 'sequels', 'ever', 'one', 'least', 'things', 'think', 'not', 'are', 'how', 'poke', 'holes', 'story']",The Philadelphia Experiment

Instead, the movie and its reviews need some historical and scientific perspective.First, degaussing of naval ships started with the British early in World War 2. The Germans had developed mine fuses capitalizing on the magnetic fields generated by steel ships traveling through salt water. English scientists in the war department quickly developed degaussing coils for ships entering/leaving the areas around their harbors, where supply and war ships entered. The harbors and several areas in the North Atlantic were where the Germans had concentrated their mining efforts, and the initial shipping losses threatened to strangle the British supply life-line.There were several interesting developments in this regard, including surrounding each ship with de-gaussing coils, building and refitting degaussing internal to each ship, etc. Churchill's 6-volume series on World War II should be required reading, and the prose and style is something to relish.Second, ""secret"" U.S. Naval experiments are not going to be known to the general public, unless there is a major disaster that exposes it in some horrific way to a large population. If part of your body gets caught in a steel bulkhead, you can bend over and kiss your tutu goodbye -- permanently.Finally, Einstein's Unified Field Theory never made it to the TRUE ""Theory"" category. The ""theory"" was -- and is -- an effort by theorists to understand and explain Natural Laws using a common set of equations.

Pare falls in love with the wonderful Nancy Allen (CARRIE, BLOWOUT, DRESSED TO KILL), and their romance is a key element in the eventual climax.The special effects are commendable for a 1984 movie; the direction is adequate, and most of the performances very good.  Nancy combines her naivete with those lovely eyes to make a wonderful heroine, and Michael Pare shows a good range of emotion in trying to decide where he truly belongs.This is one of the better time travel movies, and inspired a sequel with Brad Johnson.",3,SHIP AHOY,1085184000,"05 22, 2004",2004,1242,"['When', 'time', 'travel', 'screen', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'many', 'attempts', 'favorite', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'episode', 'Shatner', 'back', 'time', 'love', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'killed', 'leave', 'behind', 'THE', 'PHILADELPHIA', 'EXPERIMENT', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'little', 'better', 'timecrossed', 'lovers', 'Based', 'what', 'was', 'supposedly', 'real', 'experiment', '1943', 'movie', 'fate', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'Bobby', 'DiCicco', 'who', 'experiment', 'Philadelphia', 'find', '1984', 'Nevada', 'Somehow', 'same', 'scientist', 'who', 'did', '1943', 'experiment', 'still', 'trying', 'make', 'town', 'invisible', 'doing', 'so', 'vortex', 'two', '40s', 'soldiers', 'modern', 'times', 'Pare', 'love', 'wonderful', 'Nancy', 'Allen', 'CARRIE', 'BLOWOUT', 'DRESSED', 'TO', 'KILL', 'romance', 'key', 'element', 'eventual', 'climax.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'commendable', '1984', 'movie', 'direction', 'adequate', 'most', 'performances', 'very', 'good', 'Nancy', 'naivete', 'lovely', 'eyes', 'make', 'wonderful', 'heroine', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'good', 'range', 'emotion', 'trying', 'decide', 'where', 'truly', 'belongs.This', 'one', 'better', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'inspired', 'sequel', 'Brad', 'Johnson']",The Philadelphia Experiment

That was a lot better, but I just didn't remember the opening scenes being so dull and unimportant.  They were.  My first reaction, having not seen this for at least 15 years, was that the hair styles are straight out of the early 80's and not fitting at all for a sailor in the 40's.  I also recognized Bobby Di Cicco, who was one of the main characters in 1941 (which is far better) and wore the same sailor suit and had the same 1980's hair for a 1941 period film.I think the action is pretty straight forward and the premise interesting.  The actor for David Herdig (a Patrick Swayze wannabe, but dumber looking), I found not nearly as believable as the earlier times I've seen this film....again, the blow-dried hair look of the 80's. Bobbie DiCicco was pretty well caught in the act of acting in the scene just after arriving in 1984. Overacting that is.  Nancy Allen is as hot as ever...and I can see why she was popular for that period...also appeared in 1941 and was hot in that too!!!

485757,AZCDCO6KK2T81,6305971935,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[10, 10]","I've always liked the two lead actors in this film, Michael Pare of ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" and ""Streets of Fire"", and Nancy Allen (wife of Brian DePalma) of DePalma films ""Carrie"", ""Blow out"", and ""Dressed to Kill.""  Neither actor ever made it really big and were more flashes in the pan than anything else, but they both should have more success as they are decent actors.  Allen had played rather slutty characters with conviction for much of her career, but here she is disarmingly sweet and innocent in spite of her 80's hairdo.  Pare built a short-lived career playing James Dean-like roles.  He's mostly tough, but can be sensitive too.  The scenes where he learns of his father's passing and when he must say good-bye to both his best friend and Allen are quite touching.  He's a tough guy who isn't afraid to cry on-screen.  He was refreshing as an actor and his full range of talents were not nearly tapped enough.The story has been explained to death already here in other reviews and Amazon's synopsis, so I'll suffice to say that the script is faulty at times, but the story is satisfying enough and based upon an ill-conceived military experiment to cloak our ships that supposedly was really done and had back-fired.  The special effects are very dated in this film, but they are watchable nevertheless.  In fact, the entire film is rather dated, but still enjoyable.Weaknesses: The film is rather dated and the effects clearly demonstrate that.  The time-travel storyline has some flaws in it.  Things don't always add up right.  It's annoying at times when people who knew Pare's character in 1943 don't recognize him in 1984 although he hasn't changed in 40 years.  I might be shocked that he hadn't aged, but I would certainly recognize him nevertheless.  How come Pare's and his friend, who are naval men, do not have miliatry haircuts.  Pare looks the same as he did in ""Eddie and the Cruisers.""  One final flaw worth mentioning is how Pare's character, a civilian in 1984, can take two hostages at gunpoint into a highly restricted secret naval base with little to no opposition.  It's just too implausible.  Why not just have him be caught instead of the elaborate and silly break-in to a place the government wanted him at in the first place?Strengths: Overall, the film still holds up and is fun entertainment as long as you don't question things too much.

485763,A4JHEO7H330AF,6305971935,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT is a one hour and 37 minute color film with the time travel theme.  The film concerns an experiment conducted in 1943, which involves the cloaking of navy ships to prevent detection by radar.  But the experiment did not to expected, and the result is that one of the ships totally disappeared from sight.  Some of the people on the ship were injured or killed, and two of them Michael Pare (the handsome-looking one), and his friend Bobby Di Cicco (the ordinary-looking one) get transported to the future.  The pair land in the Mojave desert, where they become fugitives.  Eventually, they hijack an automobile driven by a girl (Nancy Allen) who is driving her old automobile on the way to California to seek employment.  They force the girl to drive.  There are some police chases, and the automobile tumbles down an embankment, and the trio winds up in a hospital.  The weather had been a bit severe, of late, and there are unexpected thunderstorms, with scary lightning, resembling the scary lightning bolts of WAR OF THE WORLDS, with Tom Cruise.  While in a hospital, one of the lightning bolts takes effect on Bobby Di Cicco, and he is transported back to the past, that is, to the year 1943.  Then, Michael Pare and Nancy Allen become fugitives again, and there are more chase scenes.  The pair eventually find their way to a gas station that was once owned by Michael Pare's father, and they admire an array of photographs displayed in the window of the gas station, and Michael Pare sees a photograph of himself posing with his father.  The photo was taken in the year 1943, or perhaps a year or so before that.  Michael Pare interviews the current owner of the gas station, and he is pleased and gratified to learn that his father's life-long dream of becoming a race car driver was fulfilled.  But Michael Pare is also heartbroken, to learn that his father had recently died.Then, Michael Pare and Nancy Allen resume their automotive flight, and manage to locate Bobby Di Cicco, who at that time was about about 65 years old (the actor playing him is an old man).  Bobby Di Cicco is owner of a large grape vineyard.  But Bobby Di Cicco refuses to communicate with Michael Pare, because he hated the fact that he had been subjected to severe ridicule for his tale of being transported the future, and then transported back to the year 1943.  That said, Michael Pare and Nancy Allen become fugitives again, and are on the road.  SPOILER ALERT:  I will not write anything further about the plot, and so I will not spoil the ending for you.NANCY ALLEN.  When I discovered this movie on YouTube, I told myself, ""Oh no, this is going to be just another time travel movie.""  But then I recognized the face of one of the actors.  It was Nancy Allen.  Nancy Allen plays a genuinely caring physical therapist in the excellent OUTER LIMITS episode from 1995, called VALERIE 23.  As with some of the color versions of the OUTER LIMITS, and also with some of the color versions of TWILIGHT ZONE, it is the case that VALERIE 23 is absolutely superb. And so, I made sure to watch THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT right away, and I was pleasantly surprised that her character in this movie is much the same as that in VALERIE 23, that is, a character who is caring, sympathetic, and patient.COMPARED WITH OTHER TIME TRAVEL MOVIES.  For some time travel movies, the attraction is the glitziness and whiz-bang of being able to travel through time. This sort of attraction is found in TIME TUNNEL, a fine television show from the 1960s.  This sort of attraction is also found in THE FINAL COUNTDOWN, starring Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen, and Katherine Ross.  But for other time travel movies, the main point is something totally different, namely, the yearning and nostalgia for an earlier and less troubled time, or a yearning to be with a loved once who has long been missed. THE FINAL COUNTDOWN has a striking similarity with THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT, because the time travel device takes the form of a vortex, and because the vortex sucks up navy ships.  But FINAL COUNTDOWN lacks in any humanity or nostalgia.  TIME TO TIME (2001) is another time-travel story, which dwells extensively on the ability of time travel to fulfill nostalgic yearning.  TIME TO TIME is one of my very favorite stories, taking into account all of the television shows and all of the movies that exist.  Other time-travel shows that are about nostalgic yearnings include the Twilight Zone episode WALKING DISTANCE, and the Twilight Zone episode A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY.CONCLUDING REMARKS.  THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT provides excellent character development.  It has visual effects that are somewhat crude, now and then, being as the film was released in 1984.  Despite the well-worn theme of time-travel, it is the case that THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT has a unique plot.  The film cannot easily be characterized as being derivative of other movies.  I liked the chemistry between Michael Pare and Nancy Allen.  The acting was honest and convincing.  I liked the scenes taking place in the Mojave Desert, since I have made about 40 trips to this particular desert (Death Valley, Searles Valley, Panamint Valley, Mojave National Preserve), during the past three years.",5,"This is not ""just another"" time-travel movie",1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,5263,"['PHILADELPHIA', 'EXPERIMENT', 'one', 'hour', '37', 'minute', 'color', 'film', 'time',
