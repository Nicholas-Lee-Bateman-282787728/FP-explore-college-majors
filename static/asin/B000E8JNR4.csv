And the irony of the clergyman having &#34;known&#34; Mrs. Warren lost its impact and seemed a sophmoric way of making a point.  However, Shaw himself may be to blame about that. This important play, which depends upon huge disparities between so-called respectability of proper professions and Mrs. Warren's profession as competent manager of brothels, looses its edge in this production.  The sets and costumes are ugly.  Nevertheless, if you can forget that and listen to what the characters actually say, you may find yourself becoming involved in the drama.  I was going to watch with friends and recommend to students interested in early discussions about making a living, but the static way of filming the play (I can't think of a different way) makes me think I'm not goinb to watch it again.  In this case, reading the play would probably be more enjoyable.",2,Mrs. Warren's Profession,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,1040,"['what', 'viewers', 'see', 'filming', 'play', 'artifice', 'emphasized', 'could', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'quite', 'moving', 'dynamic', 'Mrs.', 'Warren', 'over-protected', 'daughter', 'irony', 'clergyman', 'having', '34', 'known', '34', 'Mrs.', 'Warren', 'lost', 'impact', 'seemed', 'sophmoric', 'way', 'making', 'point', 'However', 'Shaw', 'may', 'be', 'blame', 'important', 'play', 'huge', 'disparities', 'so-called', 'respectability', 'proper', 'professions', 'Mrs.', 'Warren', 'profession', 'competent', 'manager', 'brothels', 'edge', 'production', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'ugly', 'Nevertheless', 'can', 'forget', 'listen', 'what', 'characters', 'actually', 'say', 'may', 'find', 'becoming', 'involved', 'drama', 'was', 'going', 'watch', 'friends', 'recommend', 'students', 'interested', 'early', 'discussions', 'making', 'living', 'static', 'way', 'filming', 'play', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'different', 'way', 'think', ""'m"", 'not', 'goinb', 'watch', 'again', 'case', 'reading', 'play', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable']",Mrs. Warren's Profession

The actors obviously did an excellent job on it. It's the mood of the play that hit me so negatively. It presents us with a heavy message, but so somber and depressing that I wasn't ready for it today.If you're looking for a ""lived happily ever after"" kind of a story, this isn't it.If you're looking for a play with an excellent message that causes you to think differently than you did before, this may be your cup of tea.Perhaps all businessmen and women need to see this one. The message is worth it.------There is a bonus called ""You Never Can Tell"" which much better matched my mood. It is hilariously funny. The younger children kept me in stitches.

970223,A1CMAK5IPJRK0L,B000E8JNR4,"Cat ""hopeless-anglophile""","[6, 6]","After seeing Mrs. Warren's Profession, it's hard to imagine it being a banned play especially since it's subject matter is mostly implied. Most of the characters are appalled by it and the end is sort of a triumph for morals and the low opinion of people who have a wicked past. It seems to be rooting for everything that is Victorian-for high society, the improvement of women and setting the example for proper behavior and shunning those-even people who are loved should they partake in questionable activities. Some of Shakespeare's plots are a thousand times worse than this--Titus Andronicus anyone?-and I don't recall them being banned in Victorian England. Unless it's because the perpetrators here are women or because the hypocrisy of Victorian society was under fire and of course ...that will never do. In any case, ""Mrs. Warren's Profession"" is a battle of values..or virtue..and both of them make a pretty strong case. Will Mummy be put in her place or will her daughter be kicked off her high-and-mighty pedestal? The final scene will blow you away. The cast are all veteran stage actors and they thoroughly understand Shaw's language and pacing especially Robert Powell-who is hysterical as the sharp-tongued, passionate, neighborhood fop. Powell also appears in the bonus feature ""You Never Can Tell,"" another Shaw comedy. In that one, while there were some good moments, was a little exhausting. It's worth seeing for more of Powell's witty banter-something he obviously enjoys and also for Judy Parfitt who always gives such solid performances (see her in Jewel in the Crown or Dolores Claiborne). Both productions are low budget and sometimes with other BBC productions, movies filmed on stage sets can be a little jarring, but the setting on these films is rather charming and it becomes secondary, to these wonderful, brilliant actors.",5,"You'll love these evah, evah so much!",1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,1857,"['seeing', 'Mrs.', 'Warren', 'Profession', 'hard', 'imagine', 'being', 'banned', 'play', 'especially', 'subject', 'matter', 'mostly', 'implied', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'appalled', 'end', 'sort', 'triumph', 'morals', 'low', 'opinion', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'wicked', 'past', 'be', 'rooting', 'everything', 'Victorian-for', 'high', 'society', 'improvement', 'women', 'setting', 'example', 'proper', 'behavior', 'shunning', 'those-even', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'loved', 'should', 'partake', 'questionable', 'activities', 'Shakespeare', 'plots', 'are', 'thousand', 'times', 'worse', 'Titus', 'Andronicus', 'anyone', '-and', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'being', 'banned', 'Victorian', 'England', 'perpetrators', 'here', 'are', 'women', 'hypocrisy', 'Victorian', 'society', 'was', 'fire', 'course', 'will', 'never', 'do', 'case', 'Mrs.', 'Warren', 'Profession', 'battle', 'values..or', 'virtue..and', 'make', 'pretty', 'strong', 'case', 'Will', 'Mummy', 'be', 'put', 'place', 'will', 'daughter', 'be', 'kicked', 'off', 'high-and-mighty', 'pedestal', 'final', 'scene', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'cast', 'are', 'veteran', 'stage', 'actors', 'thoroughly', 'understand', 'Shaw', 'language', 'pacing', 'especially', 'Robert', 'Powell-who', 'hysterical', 'sharp-tongued', 'passionate', 'neighborhood', 'fop', 'Powell', 'also', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Never', 'Can', 'Tell', 'Shaw', 'comedy', 'one', 'were', 'good', 'moments', 'was', 'little', 'exhausting', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'Powell', 'witty', 'banter-something', 'obviously', 'also', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'who', 'always', 'such', 'solid', 'performances', 'see', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'Dolores', 'Claiborne', 'productions', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'sometimes', 'other', 'BBC', 'productions', 'movies', 'filmed', 'stage', 'sets', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'jarring', 'setting', 'films', 'rather', 'charming', 'secondary', 'wonderful', 'brilliant', 'actors']",Mrs. Warren's Profession
970224,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,B000E8JNR4,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[24, 25]","Often the most interesting and engaging part of a GEorge Bernard Shaw drama is his preface. One feels the play was written only to give opportunity for writing the preface. With Saint Joan, Pygmalion, Major Barbara, and Mrs. Warren, Mr. Shaw reports most explicitly and at length in the preface the subtle points of the play. In this case, we do not read the preface, but see the play in its entirety, well played, and denuded of its excellent preface. Nevertheless, we get the message, that the British aristocracy and anglican ecclesial authorities found too much profit in the Mrs. Warren's profession and its ancillary support systems and accidental legal proceedings to do away with it by providing a good professional education or a living wage to women factory workers, etc.Unlike some others of this series, the BBC got it right with this Shavian production. The acting is excellent; the direction sublime. Despite the tendency towards preachiness and unreal dialogue or situations in Mr. Shaw's work, this production is very convincing to the modern ""realist"" viewer. The most direct comments on societal systemic injustice are pronounced with great emotion and conviction which makes them compelling and real. Perhaps we in our time and place do not speak in this manner anymore, but the actors here with great talent and skill can sell us their lines and we believe them as true. And what they have to say is in fact true, and a scathing commentary on the capitalist system which found great profit in starving women with slave wages in dangerous conditions, denying them education and suffrage, etc. and forcing them for survival's sake into the most degrading and demoralizing of work, including Mrs. Warren's Profession, which we see here for what it is, not a a labor of love but of toil and horror, and profit to its distant investors, including the renters of the same anglican church which then preaches against it. The play asks us wherein lies the fault of this grotesque immorality: in the individual women or in the society which forces them into it and supports it and coldly receives the profit sharing?For once you can trust the BBC production is very well done, and supports this drama by Irish playwright Mr. Shaw, whose total work deserves now more than ever complete and careful study. The other drama attached to this disk is of lesser interest, as it is more of a drawing room family drama, with some slight economic and social comment, but less well presented, despite Patrick the great Irish actor growling and glowering throughout.
