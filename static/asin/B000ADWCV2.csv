926340,A5XNVUPFUDRZC,B000ADWCV2,HolocaustHistory channel,"[3, 30]","On February 29, 1944 H. Hewet, Assistant Secretary of the British Ministry of Information sent a note to the higher British Clergy and to the BBC warning that the atrocities committed by the Red Army would put ""an undue strain on public opinion in this country."" He added the following revealing words:""The disclosures of the past quarter of a century will render mere denials unconvincing.  The only alternative to denial is to distract public attention from the whole subject.""Experience has shown that the best distraction is atrocity propaganda directed against the enemy. Unfortunately the public is no longer so susceptible as in the days of the ""Corpse Factory,"" the ""Mutilated Belgian Babies,"" and the ""Crucified Canadians.""""Your cooperation is therefore earnestly sought to distract public attention from the doings of the Red Army by your wholehearted support of various charges against the Germans and Japanese which have been and will be put into circulation by the Ministry.""Your expression of belief in such may convince others."" [quoted in Allied Wartime Diplomacy by Edward J. Rozek, p. 210]The policy of using atrocity propaganda to avert criticism of the war was followed diligently by British, Americans, and Soviets.  This film is the fruits of their efforts.The corpses of the victims of a typhus epidemic which broke out at Bergen-Belsen in the last months of the war (the result of deteriorating sanitary conditions caused by the the allied bombing campaign's disruption of supply and provisioning) are exploited to suggest a general inhumanity on the part of the Germans.  The Belsen SS guards were captured, says the movie.  Not so.  As it happens, they decided to stay voluntarily to fulfil their duty to take care of the prisoners to the best of their ability.  Hanging was the reward the British gave for such devotion.The Dachau gas chamber also makes an appearance.  Even the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum admits that there is no credible evidence that people were gassed at Dachau.  In fact, the ""gas chamber"" was created (by altering an existing room) for propaganda purposes by American forces after they captured the camp.At Buchenwald the fabrication of evidence continues.  The narrator claims that the commandant ordered at least 600 Jewish deaths per day (there is no documentation whatsoever to confirm this invention), and the film follows in detail the psychological warfare operation involving exhibits of shrunken human heads and lampshades made out of human skin. No serious historian dares to defend such frauds today - but neither do many speak out loud the evident fact that they were frauds.  (In this connection, one should view the film ""Buchenwald: a dumb dumb portrayal of evil."")The lies about the other camps are similar. The film also repeats the Soviet claim that four million had been killed at Auschwitz, which even the holocaust industry admits was a grotesque lie.There is absolutely no redeeming educational value in this film, aside from its utility as an example of mendacious atrocity propaganda, and even in that role it would require a detailed knowledge of the subject on the part of the viewer (for the attaining of which one might begin withLectures on the Holocaust Controversial Issues Cross-examined (15)by Germar Rudolf), a determination not to be hoodwinked by cinematic manipulation, and a well-developed skepticism towards the claims made by self-serving authorities.",1,Hate propaganda in the service of war,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,3453,"['February', '29', '1944', 'H.', 'Hewet', 'Assistant', 'Secretary', 'British', 'Ministry', 'Information', 'sent', 'note', 'higher', 'British', 'Clergy', 'BBC', 'warning', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Red', 'Army', 'would', 'put', 'undue', 'strain', 'public', 'opinion', 'country', 'added', 'following', 'revealing', 'words', 'disclosures', 'past', 'quarter', 'century', 'will', 'render', 'mere', 'denials', 'unconvincing', 'only', 'alternative', 'denial', 'distract', 'public', 'attention', 'whole', 'subject', 'Experience', 'shown', 'best', 'distraction', 'atrocity', 'propaganda', 'directed', 'enemy', 'Unfortunately', 'public', 'no', 'longer', 'so', 'susceptible', 'days', 'Corpse', 'Factory', 'Mutilated', 'Belgian', 'Babies', 'Crucified', 'Canadians', 'cooperation', 'therefore', 'earnestly', 'sought', 'distract', 'public', 'attention', 'doings', 'Red', 'Army', 'wholehearted', 'support', 'various', 'charges', 'Germans', 'Japanese', 'have', 'been', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'circulation', 'Ministry', 'expression', 'belief', 'such', 'may', 'convince', 'others', '[', 'quoted', 'Allied', 'Wartime', 'Diplomacy', 'Edward', 'J.', 'Rozek', '210', 'policy', 'using', 'atrocity', 'propaganda', 'avert', 'criticism', 'war', 'was', 'followed', 'diligently', 'British', 'Americans', 'Soviets', 'film', 'fruits', 'efforts.The', 'corpses', 'victims', 'typhus', 'epidemic', 'broke', 'out', 'Bergen-Belsen', 'last', 'months', 'war', 'result', 'deteriorating', 'sanitary', 'conditions', 'caused', 'allied', 'bombing', 'campaign', 'disruption', 'supply', 'provisioning', 'are', 'exploited', 'suggest', 'general', 'inhumanity', 'part', 'Germans', 'Belsen', 'SS', 'guards', 'were', 'captured', 'movie', 'Not', 'so', 'decided', 'stay', 'voluntarily', 'fulfil', 'duty', 'take', 'care', 'prisoners', 'best', 'ability', 'Hanging', 'was', 'reward', 'British', 'gave', 'such', 'devotion.The', 'Dachau', 'gas', 'chamber', 'also', 'appearance', 'Even', 'United', 'States', 'Holocaust', 'Memorial', 'Museum', 'credible', 'evidence', 'people', 'were', 'gassed', 'Dachau', 'fact', 'gas', 'chamber', 'was', 'created', 'altering', 'existing', 'room', 'propaganda', 'purposes', 'American', 'forces', 'captured', 'camp.At', 'Buchenwald', 'fabrication', 'evidence', 'narrator', 'commandant', 'ordered', 'least', '600', 'Jewish', 'deaths', 'day', 'documentation', 'whatsoever', 'confirm', 'invention', 'film', 'detail', 'psychological', 'warfare', 'operation', 'involving', 'exhibits', 'shrunken', 'human', 'heads', 'lampshades', 'made', 'human', 'skin', 'serious', 'historian', 'dares', 'defend', 'such', 'frauds', 'today', 'do', 'many', 'speak', 'out', 'evident', 'fact', 'were', 'frauds', 'connection', 'one', 'should', 'view', 'film', 'Buchenwald', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'portrayal', 'evil', 'lies', 'other', 'camps', 'are', 'similar', 'film', 'also', 'Soviet', 'claim', 'four', 'million', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'Auschwitz', 'even', 'holocaust', 'industry', 'was', 'grotesque', 'absolutely', 'redeeming', 'educational', 'value', 'film', 'aside', 'utility', 'example', 'mendacious', 'atrocity', 'propaganda', 'even', 'role', 'would', 'require', 'detailed', 'knowledge', 'subject', 'part', 'viewer', 'attaining', 'one', 'might', 'begin', 'withLectures', 'Holocaust', 'Controversial', 'Issues', 'Cross-examined', '15', 'Germar', 'Rudolf', 'determination', 'not', 'be', 'hoodwinked', 'cinematic', 'manipulation', 'well-developed', 'skepticism', 'claims', 'made', 'self-serving', 'authorities']",Frontline - Memory of the Camps
