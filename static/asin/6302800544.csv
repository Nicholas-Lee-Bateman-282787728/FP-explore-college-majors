The war experience ultimately rips to shreds what was already a fragile psyche of Birdy - whose fixation with birds now has him believing that he is a bird - and he is sent to a mental hospital for treatment. Columbato - who was also injured in the war - goes beyond the call of duty to help his friend find his way ""home.""The use of numerous flashback scenes of their life together as teenagers during the 1960s makes for a dynamic reminder of the potential of youth and the end of the innocence.

So did Birdy (played by Matthew Modine).Stuck in a world where he feels he does not belong growing up tethered to the ground by gravity he seeks escape through flight.The flight is as spiritual as it is physical as Birdy makes every effort to run from this world he did not create. He finds one true friend (Played by Nicholas Cage), someone who accepts him unconditionally. This friend (though he has a name there is no use for them in this film) is Birdy's only grounding to a world which holds the horrors of bullies grown up to play with adult toys of war. Birdy's Psyche, wrenched in anger and anguish, trying to come to terms with the things that he cannot understand by seeing them through the eyes of a spirit he can understand...that of a bird...so caged.All of this is set masterfully against Peter Gabriel's soundtrack which is simply his album, ""Security,"" revamped for the film without the lyrics. Interestingly enough though, for those Gabriel fans out there, if you listen to Security and truly read the lyrics it will help you to understand the film. The haunting melody of Wallflower, a song depicting a person who has been institutionalized and is asked to maintain his spirit and not break nor bend to the will of the ""keepers"" plays throughout this film (sans lyrics of course).

Both Cage and Modine give outstanding performances at this early time in both of their careers.  The intense and even intimate friendship they share is both touching and inspiring.  I wish I were still that close with many of the friends who I thought would be ""brothers"" of mine forever.  I'll admit that I am moved to tears several times in this film after dozens of viewings.Peter Gabriel's soundtrack is haunting, as are many of the visual images. Yes, it definitely has one of the most ""controversial"" endings of any film I have ever seen. You and your friends will talk about this one for quite a while!  Even if you hate the ending, don't let it ruin the rest of the film.Spoiler:  I think that at the ending Birdy is helping Al understand that his behavior -- flying and catatonia -- haven't been all that strange or even that inappropriate.  When Al freaks out over his leap from the roof, he doesn't understand why.  He's fine.  So he simply says, ""What?""  It doesn't matter if the hospital orderlies catch them.

336331,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,6302800544,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[29, 31]","?Birdy? gets my nod as one of the greatest and most compelling movies of all time in so many ways. While it is like many that focus on the effects of the war in Vietnam, this movie is the most unique story of friendship, the effects of military combat, and eccentricity like no other movie of the 1980s or ever for that matter.Nicholas Cage and Matthew Modine star in ?Birdy? as two lifelong friends from the run-down industrial ghettos of Philadelphia where they have played baseball together and ?Birdy? has had a huge passionate obsession with birds throughout his life and has dreamed of being able to fly like a bird. However, the two friends are recruited into the U.S. Army and are involved in the fighting in Vietnam and when they return, both are horribly scarred. One has suffered physical wounds with face wounds while the other has mental scars (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and being driven mad from the horrors of fighting in Vietnam, has almost withdrawn into his own ?birdland? and acting like a bird and not responding to outside social stimuli. As a result, Birdy has been hospitalized in a decrepit mental institution. Now Al Columbato must try to get his friend Birdy to be able to emerge from his catatonic state if he wants to leave the mental hospital and return to a normal life. During all of this, we can be able to see the flashbacks into Birdy and Al?s past and see how ?bird boy?s? obsession with birds grew increasingly strong and started to strain his social life with his friend and others around him but yet see very compelling acts of bonding between the two unlikely friends and how they?ve gone through so much together even before the war.The characters are among the most compelling I?ve ever seen in a drama movie ever. This might be considered a ?coming of age? movie but it?s so much more than just your average teen angst movie. ?Birdy? delves into some of the strangest and most unique perspectives of obsessive people with their subjects of interests and the things that true friends go through in order to stay bonded forever. The photography is stunningly brilliant and stunning beautiful thanks to ironically, it?s relatively primitive filming technology that was used in filming it. The grittiness of the movie while it may be a bit irritating, gives this movie a strangely opaque feel and some of the scenes which are throughout this film are absolutely moving and will tug at your heartstrings.  All of the scenes of the birds flying into the air are perfectly filmed and enhance the movie?s emotional quality even more. While this movie is very heavy in it?s bittersweet plot, there are some really smart and honest comedic elements that are really funny without detracting anything from it?s dramatic tone and the funnier parts make this movie ever more bittersweet. Sometimes I would go far enough to say that this almost has high amounts of both even though there is far, FAR more drama.  ?Birdy? is bizarre, psychotic, happy, sad, dark, bright, and a whole lot of other positive things.Director Alan Parker creates one of the most compelling movies of all time. While nothing could ever go wrong with this movie, his directing made it so much more powerful, moving, funny in odd ways, and yet very vivid on such high levels unparalleled. This movie centers on some of the more unattractive areas of Philadelphia (At least at the time, I?m not sure about today) like industrial junkyards, landfills, and run down neighborhoods, but centering on one like these areas makes this movie so much more interesting and from my standpoint, aims to dispel the notion that all poor areas are necessarily dangerous and crime-ridden. While it was centered on Philadelphia, this movie reminds me of what many areas of Chicago looked like during my childhood memories: Weed-ridden, extremely gritty, seedy, and depressed (Many of them have seen serious gentrification in recent years), at least at the time.Nicholas Cage and Matthew Modine in their earliest days of their acting careers are absolutely amazing as Al and ?birdy?. The interactions between the two characters in the movie are absolutely realistic and really bittersweet. While not throwing a beating by any means at his later movies, I personally think that Nicholas Cage?s acting hasn?t reached the early pinnacle as on ?Birdy? but sometimes there?s the saying that it?s ?Never as Good As The First Time? and it surely applies here. Matthew Modine is the most compelling lead in this movie as his portrayal of Birdy is incredible, vivid, and believable. By the way, he?s the guy on the album cover of the soundtrack by Peter Gabriel which brings to mind the soundtrack.The music along makes this movie really vividly bittersweet with really powerful background music that perfectly fits with the movie?s really obscure tone with songs like ?Under Lock and Key? and ?Close Up? which is actually expanded from the 50 second version on the CD and includes the chord progression of it?s parent track ?Family Snapshot? and it?s absolutely haunting and thought-provoking. Most of the songs on the soundtrack can be heard in the background if one listens carefully and it?s absolutely haunting and makes the various scenes even more compelling. What?s even more unique is how this movie doesn?t seem to rely on generic orchestra background music for a change. The haunting music at the beginning has the haunting eerie song ?Slow Water? mixed with the song ?Quiet & Alone? and combining the two songs makes it so amazing like no other movie opening theme.?Birdy? wasn?t a massive hit in the USA due to it?s unconventional nature and lack of a ?formulaic plot? especially when ?Terminator? and ?Temple of Doom? were riding high, but this has become one of my favorite movies of the decade. If you can find this movie on DVD, then you MUST buy this ASAP. It may be a bit slow paced at first but it allows a lot of character development and allows you to know them very well and ?Birdy? will ultimately be one of the most rewarding movies you?ll ever see. It is intense without being violent or bloody, or even immensely depressing.This is quite simply the most brilliant and evocative masterpieces of the 1980s and one of histories lost treasures. I could go for a very long time with this review but since there is only a limited space for reviews on here, I have no choice but to end it here.",5,Hauntingly and evocative movie of friendship and

336333,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,6302800544,General Breadbasket,"[4, 4]","""Birdy"" is a 1984 drama film set around two fresh Vietnam War veterans, with a score by Peter Gabriel. I picked it up mainly because of Gabriel's score, but after watching it discovered it was a brilliant and moving film as well.Birdy (Matthew Modine) and Al (Nicholas Cage) are good friends, and have been since high school back in Philadelphia. Al's a wrestling champ at school, a bit lusty and is often getting into trouble. Birdy's a more quiet kind of guy, not really interested in girls, and sticks to himself. He loves birds, builds his own set of wings, and trains carrier pigeons. He's so far into birds and flying it's more than a bit of a worry sometimes, and has got him into trouble more than once. The obsessive nature is from his father's side. When Birdy's Dad was a boy he was really into making wicker chairs, so he understands his son. His mother doesn't understand as much, and is rather worried at and angry about Birdy's passions. Still, Al and Birdy have a good time, they're always getting part time jobs together, trying to make some money. They end up going to Vietnam, and both come back messed up, Al physically (half his face was blown off), and Birdy mentally (Birdy now acts like a bird). Birdy is now in the psychiatric ward of a military hospital, and Al, covered in bandages, has been called in to see if he can talk Birdy out of his condition. If he can't, says the psychiatrist, he'll be sent to an institution. So Al goes into the cramped white room where Birdy is, reminsicing about all times, getting no answer. He is convinced that Birdy is still there, deep inside, but the psychiatrist is convinced otherwise. In fact, after reviewing Al's records, he thinks that Al is equally messed up. Will Al be able to get through to Birdy, or will they both end up as institionalized war veterans?Director Alan Parker has done a really good job with the look of this film, I thought. The Philadelphia we see is run down and rubbish strewn, but unlike so many films that try to be ""gritty"", there is a warmth to these places, they feel lived-in and loved rather than just trashy. There's an atmosphere to every place, be it under the bleachers, at the hospital, or in the darkness of Birdy's cell. The characters too, are interesting, especially the way they interact. (The scene where the usually quiet Birdy has a heated argument with Al's Dad, a gruff and usually furious man, and wins, for instance). Matthew Modine captures the quiet and intense feel of Birdy's character really well, as well as his quirky, dangerous moments that worried his friends and family so much. I've had a few friends like this in my time, and I think Modine hit the personality just right. There are a few themes and social comments running through the film (when and what is mental illness, the cold, hyper-sensitive eye of the mental health system, why young men choose to go to war, the nature of a deep friendship between two young men, etc) which were interesting concepts to digest.Peter Gabriel's score heightens the emotion and themes really well. Give or take a new composition, the score is made up of instrumental tracks and segments from his third and fourth albums, ""3"" and ""Security"", with the production values leaning more towards that of the fourth album. Already being familiar with the music, it was interesting hearing how Gabriel chose to use it. Birdy seems to get the song ""Wallflower"" as his theme (which I think is rather appropriate, given the lyrics of the original) while Al, more or less, gets an instrumental of ""Family Snapshot"" in his vulnerable and emotional moments. Gabriel was a good choice for scoring this film, I thought. In those albums whose materials he used for the score, he dealt a lot with mentally vulnerable people through his lyrics, while on Genesis albums like ""Lamb Lies Down On Broadway"" explored the friendship between men (Brother John and Rael, who appear through the songs), so I think he would have understood nature of the material when scoring it. Alan Parker also made a good decision in adapting the ""Birdy"" book to screen.  Having dealt with mental trauma very well through his last film ""Pink Floyd - The Wall"", he had the experience to deal with the material with sensitivity, understanding and could add the right evocative imagery and dialogue. I got a bit emotional by the end, actually.Definitely worth a look for fans of a good drama, fans of Alan Parker and fans of Peter Gabriel.",5,"""No One Wants to Be In A Cage""",1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,4464,"['Birdy', '1984', 'drama', 'film', 'set', 'two', 'fresh', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'veterans', 'score', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'picked', 'up', 'mainly', 'Gabriel', 'score', 'watching', 'discovered', 'was', 'brilliant', 'moving', 'film', 'well.Birdy', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'Al', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'back', 'Philadelphia', 'Al', 'wrestling', 'champ', 'school', 'bit', 'lusty', 'often', 'getting', 'trouble', 'Birdy', 'more', 'quiet', 'kind', 'guy', 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'girls', 'sticks', 'birds', 'own', 'set', 'wings', 'trains', 'carrier', 'pigeons', 'so', 'far', 'birds', 'flying', 'more', 'bit', 'worry', 'sometimes', 'got', 'trouble', 'more', 'once', 'obsessive', 'nature', 'father', 'side', 'When', 'Birdy', 'Dad', 'was', 'boy', 'was', 'really', 'making', 'wicker', 'chairs', 'son', 'mother', ""n't"", 'understand', 'as', 'much', 'rather', 'worried', 'angry', 'Birdy', 'passions', 'Still', 'Al', 'Birdy', 'have', 'good', 'time', ""'re"", 'always', 'getting', 'part', 'time', 'jobs', 'together', 'trying', 'make', 'money', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'Vietnam', 'come', 'back', 'messed', 'up', 'Al', 'physically', 'face', 'was', 'blown', 'off', 'Birdy', 'mentally', 'Birdy', 'now', 'bird', 'Birdy', 'now', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'military', 'hospital', 'Al', 'covered', 'bandages', 'been', 'called', 'see', 'can', 'talk', 'Birdy', 'condition', 'ca', ""n't"", 'psychiatrist', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sent', 'institution', 'So', 'Al', 'cramped', 'white', 'room', 'where', 'Birdy', 'reminsicing', 'times', 'getting', 'answer', 'convinced', 'Birdy', 'still', 'there', 'deep', 'inside', 'psychiatrist', 'convinced', 'otherwise', 'fact', 'reviewing', 'Al', 'records', 'Al', 'equally', 'messed', 'up', 'Will', 'Al', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'Birdy', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'institionalized', 'war', 'veterans', 'Director', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'done', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'look', 'film', 'thought', 'Philadelphia', 'see', 'run', 'down', 'rubbish', 'strewn', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'try', 'be', 'gritty', 'warmth', 'places', 'feel', 'lived-in', 'loved', 'rather', 'just', 'trashy', 'atmosphere', 'place', 'be', 'bleachers', 'hospital', 'darkness', 'Birdy', 'cell', 'characters', 'too', 'are', 'interesting', 'especially', 'way', 'interact', 'scene', 'where', 'usually', 'quiet', 'Birdy', 'heated', 'argument', 'Al', 'Dad', 'gruff', 'usually', 'furious', 'man', 'wins', 'instance', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'quiet', 'intense', 'feel', 'Birdy', 'character', 'really', 'well', 'as', 'well', 'quirky', 'dangerous', 'moments', 'worried', 'friends', 'family', 'so', 'much', ""'ve"", 'had', 'few', 'friends', 'time', 'think', 'Modine', 'hit', 'personality', 'just', 'right', 'are', 'few', 'themes', 'social', 'comments', 'running', 'film', 'when', 'what', 'mental', 'illness', 'cold', 'hyper-sensitive', 'eye', 'mental', 'health', 'system', 'why', 'young', 'men', 'choose', 'go', 'war', 'nature', 'deep', 'friendship', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'etc', 'were', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'digest.Peter', 'Gabriel', 'score', 'emotion', 'themes', 'really', 'well', 'Give', 'take', 'new', 'composition', 'score', 'made', 'instrumental', 'tracks', 'segments', 'third', 'fourth', 'albums', '3', 'Security', 'production', 'leaning', 'more', 'towards', 'fourth', 'album', 'Already', 'being', 'familiar', 'music', 'was', 'interesting', 'hearing', 'how', 'Gabriel', 'chose', 'use', 'Birdy', 'get', 'song', 'Wallflower', 'theme', 'think', 'rather', 'appropriate', 'given', 'lyrics', 'original', 'Al', 'more', 'less', 'instrumental', 'Family', 'Snapshot', 'vulnerable', 'emotional', 'moments', 'Gabriel', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'scoring', 'film', 'thought', 'albums', 'materials', 'used', 'score', 'lot', 'mentally', 'vulnerable', 'people', 'lyrics', 'Genesis', 'albums', 'Lamb', 'Lies', 'Down', 'Broadway', 'explored', 'friendship', 'men', 'Brother', 'John', 'Rael', 'who', 'appear', 'songs', 'so', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'understood', 'nature', 'material', 'when', 'scoring', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'also', 'made', 'good', 'decision', 'adapting', 'Birdy', 'book', 'screen', 'Having', 'dealt', 'mental', 'trauma', 'very', 'well', 'last', 'film', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Wall', 'had', 'experience', 'deal', 'material', 'sensitivity', 'understanding', 'could', 'add', 'right', 'evocative', 'imagery', 'dialogue', 'got', 'bit', 'emotional', 'end', 'actually.Definitely', 'look', 'fans', 'good', 'drama', 'fans', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'fans', 'Peter', 'Gabriel']",Birdy VHS

It focuses the relationship of two friends, one (Nicolas Cage in one of his first roles) that has recently returned from Vietnam and ""Birdy"" (an excellent Matthew Modine), who is kept in an hospital due to (apparent) psychological disorder.The pacing is slow (pherhaps a bit too slow during the first half), presenting Cage`s character visit to his friend in order to help him and some flashbacks that showcase their teenage relationship.As the story unfolds, Birdy`s past is foreshadowed and the viewer comes across his passion, curiosity and obssession with birds, that starts to increase and soon reduces his bonds to other people and experiences.Birdy has his own little world and soon gets stuck in it, and one of his few contacts with ""common reality"" is his only friend that struggles to understand his point of view.Director Alan Parker manages to bring a deep, powerful and subtle movie that expertly deals with isolation, insanity, friendship, freedom, alienation and connection.The story wisely avoids sappy and easy melodramatic fluff, delivering a strong and honest character study that lies in the range of its two leads. Modine, in particular, is utterly convincing as the fragile, confused and innocent Birdy, providing a compelling portrayal of a youngster that percieves his own peculiar universe.This picture is also a stunning coming-of-age tale, avoiding predictable and tired cliches and presenting a unique, memmorable and sincere friendship between the two characters.The slow pacing and the beautiful cinematography help the creation of a captivating, haunting and eerie mood to the movie, becoming weirdly unsettling at times.""Birdy"" has much to recommend and really carries a feel of its own, being a great cinematic experience for those who have ever felt ""different"", misunderstoodand and seem to be outside.This is quality cinema.

Communication is impossible if there is nothing in common between the two persons. This leads us to a lot of thinking because we constantly communicate with strangers and without any ambition or desire to share anything with them. In fact it's more hatred than communication, a hatred that is covered up by the communication but in no way nullified. The second reason why this film is a masterpiece is the realization, if you enter its arguments entirely, that only some brutal and totally meaningless event can lead anyone sane and healthy into closing up the channels of artificial and depthless communication. But this absolute refusal to say anything to anyone because it is meaningless and depthless is in no way insanity. It is in fact associated by Parker with self-protection. And there the film becomes tragic because society will necessarily interpret this  refusal of superficial and meaningless communication as a rejection of society, hence as  a sure sign of insanity.

Some movies require ""the willing suspension of disbelief"" in order to enjoy them.  However, ""Birdy"" pretends to be a serious film about friendship and devotion which leaves little room for inanity (while giving plenty of room for insanity).  I note a lot of high praise bourne out of what I assume to be an emotional appeal.  I'm often taken in with such films but this one just went down too many wrong way streets to keep me involved.  The three stars I do give ""Birdy"" are for various scenes that did work well but there weren't many.",3,For the Birds,1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,887,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'got', 'copy', 'Birdy', 'watching', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'got', 'movie', 'strange', 'premises', 'teenage', 'boy', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'bird', 'All-American', 'type', 'teenager', 'would', 'befriend', 'follow', 'along', 'craziness', 'Army', 'would', 'take', 'flake', 'service', 'movies', 'require', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'order', 'enjoy', 'However', 'Birdy', 'be', 'serious', 'film', 'friendship', 'devotion', 'little', 'room', 'inanity', 'giving', 'plenty', 'room', 'insanity', 'note', 'lot', 'high', 'praise', 'bourne', 'what', 'assume', 'be', 'emotional', 'appeal', ""'m"", 'often', 'taken', 'such', 'films', 'one', 'just', 'went', 'down', 'too', 'many', 'wrong', 'way', 'streets', 'keep', 'involved', 'three', 'stars', 'do', 'give', 'Birdy', 'are', 'various', 'scenes', 'did', 'work', 'well', 'were', ""n't"", 'many']",Birdy VHS

336344,A31CWVNVR0IL9A,6302800544,Swing King,"[4, 4]","Main characters:Al: Nicolas CageBirdy: Matthew ModineSPOILER-FREE REVIEW""Birdy"" tackles the complex issue of post traumatic stress following wartime, telling the story of two childhood friends damaged by the ills of war in Vietnam. Raised in the slums of Philadelphia, Birdy and Al were very close friends as teenagers before the war. The film begins with Al returning stateside in facial bandages, headed for a military hospital at the behest of a psychiatrist who believes Al may find a way to coax Birdy from a catatonic state.The storyline drifts back and forth between the pair's childhood and the mental hospital, interspersed with flashbacks of the war. As the movie unfolds, we learn that Al just may need Birdy as much as or more than Birdy needs him. The movie takes an agonizing look at the emotional and physical trauma war can inflict on soldiers, and manages to portray the tragedy of PTSD with a silver-lining. A five-star movie with very good acting, directing and an ending which is sure to ask questions, ""Birdy"" is a wonderful addition to everyone's movie library.",5,PTSD is real,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,1083,"['Main', 'characters', 'Al', 'Nicolas', 'CageBirdy', 'Matthew', 'ModineSPOILER-FREE', 'REVIEW', 'Birdy', 'complex', 'issue', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'following', 'wartime', 'telling', 'story', 'two', 'childhood', 'friends', 'damaged', 'ills', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'Raised', 'slums', 'Philadelphia', 'Birdy', 'Al', 'were', 'very', 'close', 'friends', 'teenagers', 'war', 'film', 'Al', 'returning', 'stateside', 'facial', 'bandages', 'headed', 'military', 'hospital', 'behest', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'Al', 'may', 'find', 'way', 'coax', 'Birdy', 'catatonic', 'state.The', 'storyline', 'drifts', 'back', 'forth', 'pair', 'childhood', 'mental', 'hospital', 'interspersed', 'flashbacks', 'war', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'learn', 'Al', 'just', 'may', 'need', 'Birdy', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'Birdy', 'movie', 'agonizing', 'look', 'emotional', 'physical', 'trauma', 'war', 'can', 'inflict', 'soldiers', 'portray', 'tragedy', 'PTSD', 'silver-lining', 'five-star', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'directing', 'ending', 'sure', 'ask', 'questions', 'Birdy', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'everyone', 'movie', 'library']",Birdy VHS
