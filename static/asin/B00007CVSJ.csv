726773,A14PS3LPIO7UF8,B00007CVSJ,"Dawoud Kringle ""Renegade Sufi""","[0, 0]","In Portrait does justice to one of the greatest and most accomplished musicians of the 20th century.The movie is paced beautifully, shows the development and lifeline if this amazing man in an eloquent fashion, and intersperses vintage film in a way that augments the unfolding of Shankar's career quite well. It is both technically flawless and very beautiful.And the subject of the film - Ravi Shankar - must be addressed!Here is a man who was a seasoned musician and performer before he finished his teenage years. He engaged in intense study with the greatest Indian musician of the 20th century, and emerged a master. After establishing himself among the classical and film music world of India (with their exacting standards) he singlehandedly introduced Indian Raga to the world. In doing so, created the genre, and by default all the subsequent subgenres, of world music. And then went on to exploit unexplored possibilities in Raga; without ever once abandoning or betraying it.The music on both the documentary and concert DVDs is beyond criticism. Even in his twilight years, Shankar's power and musical brilliance remain undiminished. Personally, I am in awe of anyone who is so heavy that the likes of John Coltrane approached for music lessons!if you are a musician, lover of Indian Raga, and / or Ravi Shankar, I highly recommend this DVD.",5,A Treasure,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,1354,"['Portrait', 'justice', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'accomplished', 'musicians', '20th', 'century.The', 'movie', 'paced', 'beautifully', 'development', 'lifeline', 'amazing', 'man', 'eloquent', 'fashion', 'vintage', 'film', 'way', 'unfolding', 'Shankar', 'career', 'quite', 'well', 'technically', 'flawless', 'very', 'beautiful.And', 'subject', 'film', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'must', 'be', 'addressed', 'Here', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'seasoned', 'musician', 'performer', 'finished', 'teenage', 'years', 'engaged', 'intense', 'study', 'greatest', 'Indian', 'musician', '20th', 'century', 'emerged', 'master', 'establishing', 'classical', 'film', 'music', 'world', 'India', 'exacting', 'standards', 'singlehandedly', 'introduced', 'Indian', 'Raga', 'world', 'doing', 'so', 'created', 'genre', 'default', 'subsequent', 'subgenres', 'world', 'music', 'then', 'went', 'exploit', 'unexplored', 'possibilities', 'Raga', 'ever', 'once', 'abandoning', 'betraying', 'it.The', 'music', 'documentary', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'criticism', 'Even', 'twilight', 'years', 'Shankar', 'power', 'musical', 'brilliance', 'remain', 'undiminished', 'Personally', 'am', 'awe', 'anyone', 'who', 'so', 'heavy', 'likes', 'John', 'Coltrane', 'approached', 'music', 'lessons', 'are', 'musician', 'lover', 'Indian', 'Raga', '/', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A

Merritt,"[1, 1]","For fans of the Indian classical form, this documentary provides an indispensable and fascinating look inside the life and art of its greatest practitioner, Ravi Shankar. On the occasion of Shankar's 80th birthday in 2000, the filmmakers introduce us not only to his life story but also to his family and his day to day life, to the magical complexities of his native India, to a generous helping of his musings on his music and, on the second disc, to live performances of two ragas. The entire feature clocks in at over three hours, but it never gets boring, and there's no distracting narrator: The filmmakers wisely let the sights and the sounds of Shankar's life and music speak for themselves. And they speak volumes.",5,A Magical Journey,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,723,"['fans', 'Indian', 'classical', 'form', 'documentary', 'indispensable', 'fascinating', 'look', 'life', 'art', 'greatest', 'practitioner', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'occasion', 'Shankar', '80th', 'birthday', '2000', 'filmmakers', 'introduce', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'story', 'also', 'family', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'magical', 'complexities', 'native', 'India', 'generous', 'helping', 'musings', 'music', 'second', 'disc', 'live', 'performances', 'two', 'ragas', 'entire', 'feature', 'clocks', 'three', 'hours', 'never', 'boring', 'distracting', 'narrator', 'filmmakers', 'wisely', 'let', 'sights', 'sounds', 'Shankar', 'life', 'music', 'speak', 'speak', 'volumes']",N/A
726775,AFE0AGQT50MBJ,B00007CVSJ,KV Trout,"[1, 1]","This dvd brought me tears of joy in several places, both for the music and for the spirit and soul of the man, Ravi Shankar.I was lucky (along with millions of other ""hippies"") to have been introduced to Ravi's music back in the 60's, by George Harrison. I have listened ever since and have had the pleasure of seeing Ravi perform twice, live. Once was on his 60th birthday, and I was amazed at how good he still was. Many Western musicians seem to begin to ""lose their chops"" by the age of 60 but not Ravi!This documentary surprised me by revealing the intimate side of Ravi the child, the man, the father and husband, not just the genius musician.It is obvious that his daughter and wife and friends love him very much, and he, them, and that is wonderful to see in someone whose music you have loved and respected for so long!I learned about his childhood and was even treated to pictures and footage of Ravi as a young man! Saw pictures of his father and learned about his upbringing by his mother. One scene that made me smile was when Ravi professed his love of a movie star when he was a child living in California and when another actress there asked to adopt him, he was very sad when his family said ""no"".It was not long after that, when he made the decision and commitment to devote his love life to learning to play the sitar instead of having fun in Hollywood! What may have been a great loss for Hollywood, was a great gift to the world of music!This documentary is so well done. The way the music runs through it is perfect, and though the first disc focuses on Ravi's own words and words about him, there is plenty of music in the background as well.It gave me so much joy to see and hear him speak about music, about the sixties, about George Harrison and John Coltrane and others. I smiled when he spoke of how upset he was over Jimi Hendrix setting his guitar on fire at Monterey Pop. What was an iconical musical event for most of us, was for Ravi a great tragedy, a ""nightmare"" as he called it. His love of his instrument is so deep, he just could not imagine a great musician setting his instrument on fire!This documentary is full of such surprises and delights, and I am so happy that I finally got it!There is something so special about sitar music and there is something so special about Ravi Shankar too. I love him and I hope others can get such joy from his music, as I do.",5,A wonderful documentary on Ravi Shankar!,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,2402,"['dvd', 'brought', 'tears', 'joy', 'several', 'places', 'music', 'spirit', 'soul', 'man', 'Ravi', 'Shankar.I', 'was', 'lucky', 'millions', 'other', 'hippies', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'Ravi', 'music', 'back', '60', 'George', 'Harrison', 'have', 'listened', 'ever', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Ravi', 'perform', 'twice', 'live', 'Once', 'was', '60th', 'birthday', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'good', 'still', 'was', 'Many', 'Western', 'musicians', 'seem', 'begin', 'lose', 'chops', 'age', '60', 'not', 'Ravi', 'documentary', 'surprised', 'revealing', 'intimate', 'side', 'Ravi', 'child', 'man', 'father', 'husband', 'not', 'just', 'genius', 'musician.It', 'obvious', 'daughter', 'wife', 'friends', 'love', 'very', 'much', 'wonderful', 'see', 'someone', 'music', 'have', 'loved', 'respected', 'so', 'long', 'learned', 'childhood', 'was', 'even', 'treated', 'pictures', 'footage', 'Ravi', 'young', 'man', 'Saw', 'pictures', 'father', 'learned', 'upbringing', 'mother', 'One', 'scene', 'made', 'smile', 'was', 'when', 'Ravi', 'professed', 'love', 'movie', 'star', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'living', 'California', 'when', 'actress', 'there', 'asked', 'adopt', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'when', 'family', 'said', '.It', 'was', 'not', 'long', 'when', 'made', 'decision', 'commitment', 'devote', 'love', 'life', 'learning', 'play', 'sitar', 'instead', 'having', 'fun', 'Hollywood', 'What', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'loss', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'great', 'gift', 'world', 'music', 'documentary', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'way', 'music', 'perfect', 'first', 'disc', 'focuses', 'Ravi', 'own', 'words', 'words', 'plenty', 'music', 'background', 'well.It', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'joy', 'see', 'hear', 'speak', 'music', 'sixties', 'about', 'George', 'Harrison', 'John', 'Coltrane', 'others', 'smiled', 'when', 'spoke', 'how', 'upset', 'was', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'setting', 'guitar', 'fire', 'Monterey', 'Pop', 'What', 'was', 'iconical', 'musical', 'event', 'most', 'was', 'Ravi', 'great', 'tragedy', 'nightmare', 'called', 'love', 'instrument', 'so', 'deep', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'great', 'musician', 'setting', 'instrument', 'fire', 'documentary', 'full', 'such', 'surprises', 'delights', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'finally', 'got', 'something', 'so', 'special', 'sitar', 'music', 'something', 'so', 'special', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'too', 'love', 'hope', 'others', 'can', 'get', 'such', 'joy', 'music', 'do']",N/A

726777,A3P97R4Y1CU84A,B00007CVSJ,Nicholas Croft,"[21, 21]","""Between Two Worlds"", a 90 minute film by Mark Kidel, is the 'definitive' portrait of Ravi Shankar, as it attempts to encompass all facets of his life in music, while also drawing a rough sketch of his personal life as well.  The film begins in Benares, India at a birthday gathering where Ravi proclaims that his life is a spiritual journey through music, in which he feels a special love for everyone that is expressed through the language of his art.Reflections by Ravi, on his relationship with his parents and family, lead to a description of his early travels to Venice, Paris, New York and Hollywood, where he was influenced by a range of talented composers, musicians, dancers, actors and painters. In 1938, his Brahmin origins expressed their attraction in his decision to become an austere musical disciple of the guru Ustad Allauddin Khan.  He spent more that seven years with 'Baba' and came to marry his guru's daughter.This intensive musical preparation led to Ravi assuming a role as an Indian cultural ambassador, influencing musicians as diverse as Yehudi Menuhin, John Coltrane, George Harrison and Philip Glass.  The film portrays that the indisciplined excesses of the 1960's popular culture, and Ravi's own participation in this exotic milieu, led to a year and a half break from musical life and finally to a rededication to more moderate ways in the years which followed.The film closes with a tour of the construction of the Shankar foundation in New Delhi and plays a plays brief concert excerpt in which Ravi performs with a deeply solemn and profoundly beautiful sadness.  In the performance, we see that music can become almost a form of worship. A world where humility, introversion and improvisation become one in the pursuit of expressing the presence of the ineffable.Bonus footage in the two DVD set shows Ravi in the process of constructing a new musical work with his students. A second 54 minute disc records Ravi in a live performance at the Union Chapel of London with his daughter Anoushka.  If you love Indian music, then the publication of ""Ravi Shankar - In Portrait"" can be viewed as a rare event in world of international culture.",5,A Master of the Sitar and Indian Music,1057276800,"07 4, 2003",2003,2174,"['Between', 'Two', 'Worlds', '90', 'minute', 'film', 'Mark', 'Kidel', ""'definitive"", 'portrait', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'encompass', 'facets', 'life', 'music', 'also', 'drawing', 'rough', 'sketch', 'personal', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'Benares', 'India', 'birthday', 'gathering', 'where', 'Ravi', 'life', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'music', 'special', 'love', 'everyone', 'expressed', 'language', 'art.Reflections', 'Ravi', 'relationship', 'parents', 'family', 'lead', 'description', 'early', 'travels', 'Venice', 'Paris', 'New', 'York', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'was', 'influenced', 'range', 'talented', 'composers', 'musicians', 'dancers', 'actors', 'painters', '1938', 'Brahmin', 'origins', 'expressed', 'attraction', 'decision', 'become', 'austere', 'musical', 'disciple', 'guru', 'Ustad', 'Allauddin', 'Khan', 'spent', 'more', 'seven', 'years', ""'Baba"", 'came', 'marry', 'guru', 'daughter.This', 'intensive', 'musical', 'preparation', 'led', 'Ravi', 'assuming', 'role', 'Indian', 'cultural', 'ambassador', 'influencing', 'musicians', 'as', 'diverse', 'Yehudi', 'Menuhin', 'John', 'Coltrane', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'film', 'indisciplined', 'excesses', '1960', 'popular', 'culture', 'Ravi', 'own', 'participation', 'exotic', 'milieu', 'led', 'year', 'half', 'break', 'musical', 'life', 'finally', 'rededication', 'more', 'moderate', 'ways', 'years', 'followed.The', 'film', 'closes', 'tour', 'construction', 'Shankar', 'foundation', 'New', 'Delhi', 'plays', 'brief', 'concert', 'excerpt', 'Ravi', 'deeply', 'solemn', 'profoundly', 'beautiful', 'sadness', 'performance', 'see', 'music', 'can', 'become', 'almost', 'form', 'worship', 'world', 'where', 'humility', 'introversion', 'improvisation', 'become', 'one', 'pursuit', 'expressing', 'presence', 'ineffable.Bonus', 'footage', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'shows', 'Ravi', 'process', 'constructing', 'new', 'musical', 'work', 'students', 'second', '54', 'minute', 'disc', 'records', 'Ravi', 'live', 'performance', 'Union', 'Chapel', 'London', 'daughter', 'Anoushka', 'love', 'Indian', 'music', 'then', 'publication', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'Portrait', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'rare', 'event', 'world', 'international', 'culture']",N/A
