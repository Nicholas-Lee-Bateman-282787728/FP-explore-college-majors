1463739,AKGUA506COKQG,B005KC4LNU,Alison Jones,"[0, 0]","I watch an average of one movie per day on Amazon.  This film, Trigger, is among the overall best movies I've seen on here.  I know little about technical jargon, but the acting and general look of the film is as slick and well acted/directed as any, and better than most.  But what makes Trigger such a great movie, to me, is the subject matter.  This film is about 2 women (you could easily say ""2 people"" because the issues are not gender-specific) who are making their way through life's challenges, obstacles, and troubles 10 years after being in a popular rock band together... and in the middle of a rock and roll lifestyle complete with addiction and chaos.  The movie is about how the women are learning to live life without succumbing to the old vices that have previously wreaked havoc in their lives.  I definitely recommend watching it, and I'll be watching it again in the future.

And that is precisely the unofficial second title of ""Trigger,"" one of the best films that I have ever seen about music and musicians, one that will surely touch your heart.Molly Parker stars as Kat, and Tracy Wright as Vic, in a story about two retired rock and roll musicians in Canada. The movie aptly begins with some exciting and inspiring black and white footage of the happy days, while performing to an enthusiastic crowd. We then move forward ten years later, when the two of them agreed to meet for dinner at a fancy restaurant, after not seeing each other for all that time. Even though it is a friendly meeting, we feel the tension of things past, emotions that they haven't been able to sort out. However, they decide to hang out after dinner to remember the good old times. It happens that Toronto is hosting a ""Women in Rock Tribute,"" and Kat and Vic were invited. While spending the night together in one activity after the other, they open up and let their feelings toward each other come out. By doing so, we learn about them and their life after being in the spotlight.""Trigger"" is a small movie, full of emotion and great acting by both Parker and Wright. It will not only touch your heart due to the very engaging plot, but also because we learn that Tracy Wright died of cancer shortly after the film was completed. Hers was a great, final performance that we should treasure forever, and which should be awarded if there is justice in this world. The DVD features an actors' table reading and more.

I agree with someone else who said they were hoping it was a lesbian love story. Not that it was the only reason to see it, but maybe it was a little like some rock movies that have been made in the last 10 years.

As a rock film this does severely lack, they do only sing ONE song... its a good song but thats it for ""rock"". I also found a few of the sitting and reflecting moments to be too long, some good blips to make you think, but mostly quite long winded. In addition to previous comments, I as well would like to have seen some love in the movie, rather than an often hostile then complacent rekindling of friendships.
