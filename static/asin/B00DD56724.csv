Dan changing his outlook on life (SEX) and tries to settle down. Harry being accepted as a teacher teaching law. It all falls into place.

Here, it is split into two parts. The first part barely runs 21 minutes.Also, these final season episodes are almost all 21:57 when the closing credits begin. I know that television shows airing on NBC were not 22:25 total time (after the closing credit roll) on the original network run.So, has Warner Brothers charged an outrageous price for Video-on-Demand copies that have not been remastered and appear to be the syndicated rerun versions of this great sitcom?You be the judge.",1,Edited Final Season Episodes?,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,688,"['Night', 'Court', 'solid', '5', 'stars', 'television', 'show', 'dramatically', 'thanks', 'Warner', 'Home', 'video.I', 'remember', 'Night', 'Court', 'NBC', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'one', 'hour', 'series', 'finale', 'recall', 'Here', 'split', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'part', 'barely', '21', 'minutes.Also', 'final', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'almost', '21:57', 'when', 'closing', 'credits', 'begin', 'know', 'television', 'airing', 'NBC', 'were', 'not', '22:25', 'total', 'time', 'closing', 'credit', 'roll', 'original', 'network', 'run.So', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'charged', 'outrageous', 'price', 'Video-on-Demand', 'copies', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'remastered', 'appear', 'be', 'syndicated', 'rerun', 'versions', 'great', 'sitcom', 'be', 'judge']",Night Court: The Complete Ninth Season

While Harry considers a career in higher education, Christine takes a look at Congress as Dan rethinks his commitment to his primary field of interest (it's spelled S-E-X).Meanwhile ditzy-but-stunning court steno Lisette (Joleen Lutz) is harboring a secret of her own, one that concerns a prominent member of the cast. And what on Earth do aliens want with Bull? Mel Torme, Gilbert Gottfried, and Stephen Root are all found among the season's memorable guest-stars. But as the final hour airs - and the cast depart for different climes, whither Judge Harry?
