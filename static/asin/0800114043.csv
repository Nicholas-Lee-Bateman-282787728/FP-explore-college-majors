161734,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,0800114043,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[0, 0]","Frank Capra is known for making socially/politically charged films that center around a hopeful American man whose morals supersede all else. Perhaps his most immediate examples of this are Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, Mr. smith Goes To Washington, and Meet John Doe, but American Madness is where it all started. Taking place just a few years after the stock market crash, the film follows Mr. Dickson as he battles with the Board of Directors to keep his bank. Meanwhile, a bank employee named Cluett is in debt to the mob and pays them off by letting them steal the money from the bank. When word gets out that the bank has been robbed, the bank members arrive in droves to reclaim their savings. American Madness is very much a film of its time, but has also aged remarkably well. The hysteria of the bank members mirrors the nationwide recession frenzy that occurred only a few years ago. Many of Capra's films have that very same timeless quality to them. He and his longtime writing partner Robert Riskin penned a sociopolitical drama that escapes the genres rather boring trappings by infusing humorous, relatable characters and a little domestic drama for good measure. Walter Huston is on par with Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart with his portrayal of the lively Mr. Dickson who believes in faith in customers over more traditional banking practices. Kay Johnson as Mrs. Dickson is a beautiful troublemaker who has fantastic on-screen chemistry with Huston. For a relatively early talkie, Frank Capra directed American Madness with the confidence of a seasoned vet. This isn't exactly hard to believe seeing as how he directed nearly twenty films beforehand. He may have been smack dab in the middle of his career, but Frank Capra was just finding his footing as a socially astute director with a heart of gold.",5,"""You Could've Knocked Me Over With A Pin""",1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,1814,"['Frank', 'Capra', 'known', 'making', 'socially/politically', 'charged', 'films', 'center', 'hopeful', 'American', 'man', 'morals', 'supersede', 'else', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'immediate', 'examples', 'are', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', 'Mr.', 'smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'Meet', 'John', 'Doe', 'American', 'Madness', 'where', 'started', 'Taking', 'place', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Dickson', 'Board', 'Directors', 'keep', 'bank', 'Meanwhile', 'bank', 'employee', 'named', 'Cluett', 'debt', 'mob', 'off', 'letting', 'steal', 'money', 'bank', 'When', 'word', 'out', 'bank', 'been', 'robbed', 'bank', 'members', 'arrive', 'droves', 'reclaim', 'savings', 'American', 'Madness', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'time', 'also', 'aged', 'remarkably', 'well', 'hysteria', 'bank', 'members', 'mirrors', 'nationwide', 'recession', 'frenzy', 'occurred', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Many', 'Capra', 'films', 'have', 'very', 'same', 'timeless', 'quality', 'longtime', 'writing', 'partner', 'Robert', 'Riskin', 'penned', 'sociopolitical', 'drama', 'genres', 'rather', 'boring', 'trappings', 'infusing', 'humorous', 'relatable', 'characters', 'little', 'domestic', 'drama', 'good', 'measure', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'par', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'portrayal', 'lively', 'Mr.', 'Dickson', 'who', 'faith', 'customers', 'more', 'traditional', 'banking', 'practices', 'Kay', 'Johnson', 'Mrs.', 'Dickson', 'beautiful', 'troublemaker', 'who', 'fantastic', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Huston', 'relatively', 'early', 'talkie', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'directed', 'American', 'Madness', 'confidence', 'seasoned', 'vet', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'hard', 'believe', 'seeing', 'how', 'directed', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'films', 'beforehand', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'career', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'was', 'just', 'finding', 'footing', 'socially', 'astute', 'director', 'heart', 'gold']",N/A

It's easy to peg this early talkie as a dry run for ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" but it also stands on its own as a fine film, shot with a nice noir-ish feel.  The desperation and panic of the time is painfully palpable throughout this film, and the indiscriminate hysteria of the opening sequences ratchets up into individualized, personal agony as Huston steels himself to lose all that he's ever worked for.

161736,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0800114043,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 1]","""American Madness"" is one of Frank Capra's early films in which the Capraesque style began to emerge. It stars Walter Huston and Pat O'Brien and is concerned with a run on a bank.Walter Huston (1883-1950) plays a banker, a popular figure in the early 30s films. At this point in his career, Huston was churning out films at breakneck speed  - 4 in 1931, 8 in 1932, and 5 in 1933. His performances are relatively undistinguished, even if some of the films (e.g., ""Gabriel Over the White House"") were hits. Huston got better as he got older, and he was nominated for an Oscar in 1937 (""Dodsworth""), 1942 (""Devil and Daniel Webster"") and 1943 (""Yankee Doodle Dandy"") and won in 1949 for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"".The great Pat O'Brien (1899-1983) made over 100 films although his only award was an Emmy in 1974. O'Brien is well known for his films with fellow Irishman James Cagney (""Angels with Dirty Faces"", ""The Fighting 69th, ""Ragtime"") and Spencer Tracy (""People Against O'Hara"", ""The Last Hurrah), but his best known work was probably as the coach in ""Knute Rockne"" (1940). O'Brien plays an ex-convict to whom Huston has given a second chance, also a popular film icon in the early 30s.Robert Emmett O'Conner (1885-1962) plays a policeman. He's best remembered as James Cagney's mentor Paddy Ryan from ""The Public Enemy"" (1931) and as the cop who pursues the Marx Brothers in ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935), although he appeared in more than 200 films, often with Huston.Frank Capra (1897-1991) directs. He made nearly 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar 7 times, winning 3 times (""It Happened One Night"", Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" and ""You Can't Take it With You"").Writer Robert Riskin (1897-1955) is probably best known as the husband of actress Fay Wray (""King Kong"") and as the long time collaborator with Capra, with whom he did 13 films He won an Oscar for ""It Happened One Night"" and was nominated for 4 others including ""You Can't Take it With You"" and ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.""1932 was a good year for films - Grand Hotel"" was the Oscar and box office king, Jean Harlow had 2 films in the top 10 (""Red Headed Woman"" and ""Red Dust"") as did Miriam Hopkins (""Trouble in Paradise"" and ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"") and Wallace Beery (""Champ"" and ""Grand Hotel""). Other notable films from that year were ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Freaks"" ,""A Farewell to Arms"", ""Scarface"", ""Horse Feathers"" and ""Tarzan The Ape Man"".The NY Times said the film ""is emphatically melodramatic and parts of the dialogue are rough and crude"", but called Huston an ""excellent actor"" and acknowledged that ""there are some ingenious bits"". Film critic Richard Schickel called this ""Capra's first truly great film"".Capra's later film, ""It a Wonderful Life"" revisited many of the themes played out in this film - the role of the bank in the community.The acting is good, the action moves right along, and it's very interesting to see the cultural mores of the early 30s. But this is not an exceptional film in any manner, apart from being one of the first films in which we see Frank Capra's style emerge.",3,Early Capra,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,3097,"['American', 'Madness', 'one', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'early', 'films', 'Capraesque', 'style', 'began', 'emerge', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'concerned', 'run', 'bank.Walter', 'Huston', '1883-1950', 'banker', 'popular', 'figure', 'early', '30s', 'films', 'point', 'career', 'Huston', 'was', 'churning', 'out', 'films', 'breakneck', 'speed', '4', '1931', '8', '1932', '5', '1933', 'performances', 'are', 'relatively', 'undistinguished', 'even', 'films', 'e.g.', 'Gabriel', 'White', 'House', 'were', 'hits', 'Huston', 'got', 'better', 'got', 'older', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '1937', 'Dodsworth', '1942', 'Devil', 'Daniel', 'Webster', '1943', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'won', '1949', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'great', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", '1899-1983', 'made', '100', 'films', 'only', 'award', 'was', 'Emmy', '1974', 'well', 'known', 'films', 'fellow', 'Irishman', 'James', 'Cagney', 'Angels', 'Dirty', 'Faces', 'Fighting', '69th', 'Ragtime', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'People', 'Against', ""O'Hara"", 'Last', 'Hurrah', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'was', 'probably', 'coach', 'Knute', 'Rockne', '1940', ""O'Brien"", 'ex-convict', 'whom', 'Huston', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'also', 'popular', 'film', 'icon', 'early', '30s.Robert', 'Emmett', ""O'Conner"", '1885-1962', 'policeman', 'best', 'remembered', 'James', 'Cagney', 'mentor', 'Paddy', 'Ryan', 'Public', 'Enemy', '1931', 'cop', 'who', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'A', 'Night', 'Opera', '1935', 'appeared', 'more', '200', 'films', 'often', 'Huston.Frank', 'Capra', '1897-1991', 'directs', 'made', 'nearly', '50', 'films', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '7', 'times', 'winning', '3', 'times', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', '.Writer', 'Robert', 'Riskin', '1897-1955', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'husband', 'actress', 'Fay', 'Wray', 'King', 'Kong', 'long', 'time', 'collaborator', 'Capra', 'whom', 'did', '13', 'films', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'was', 'nominated', '4', 'others', 'including', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', '1932', 'was', 'good', 'year', 'films', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'was', 'Oscar', 'box', 'office', 'king', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'had', '2', 'films', 'top', '10', 'Red', 'Headed', 'Woman', 'Red', 'Dust', 'did', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'Trouble', 'Paradise', 'Dr', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'Wallace', 'Beery', 'Champ', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Other', 'notable', 'films', 'year', 'were', 'am', 'Fugitive', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'Freaks', 'A', 'Farewell', 'Arms', 'Scarface', 'Horse', 'Feathers', 'Tarzan', 'Ape', 'Man', '.The', 'NY', 'Times', 'said', 'film', 'emphatically', 'melodramatic', 'parts', 'dialogue', 'are', 'rough', 'crude', 'called', 'Huston', 'excellent', 'actor', 'acknowledged', 'are', 'ingenious', 'bits', 'Film', 'critic', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'called', 'Capra', 'first', 'truly', 'great', 'film', '.Capra', 'later', 'film', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'revisited', 'many', 'themes', 'played', 'out', 'film', 'role', 'bank', 'community.The', 'acting', 'good', 'action', 'moves', 'right', 'along', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'cultural', 'mores', 'early', '30s', 'not', 'exceptional', 'film', 'manner', 'apart', 'being', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'see', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'style', 'emerge']",N/A

161738,A37S3ACL57LN62,0800114043,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[3, 3]","American Madness is a film about the insanity of a crowd and the way a rumor can turn into a major problem. For fans of It's a Wonderful Life, this film is the problems of the Savings and Loan under a microscope. A bank is thriving during the Great Depression and is still able to lend large sums of money in hopes of pushing the economy back up to it's height. This is all thanks to the man who runs the bank (Walter Huston), fighting against his superiors the whole way. However, one of the workers (Gavin Gordon) gets into trouble with a group of gangsters, and out of fear, he aids them in robbing the bank. Now the bank has two major problems. There is a run on the bank as soon as the public finds out (and believes millions of dollars were stolen). Also, there is a murder/theft investigation among the employees for the money stolen and the guard who was killed.This film takes a bit of time to get going since it is important that we gain some sort of fondness for all of the characters but also to understand the situation of the bank and the reasons why it is so important that it stay open. As always in Frank Capra's typical films, there is a great deal of comradory and the idea that good can triumph over adversity. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen his films or heard that theory, you can't help but get caught up in it when it's happening on the screen.
