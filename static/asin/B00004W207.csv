Sadly, I was just expecting so much more from it.I bought this movie because I have been quite impressed with Dominique Swain in her last several rolls. Indeed I wrote a glowing review of the film Girl, a movie where I felt Ms Swain grew as much as an actress as her character did as a woman. Furthermore, Swain has always impressed me be it her initial starring role in the remake of Lolita to her smaller supporting role in Face/Off.Sadly, the Intern fails to showcase that talent. Swain does not put in a poor performance, but she doesn;t seem to be working in the role either. She seems to coast through it. There are moments when I felt as though she would lose herself in Jocelyn (the intern) as she had lost herself in Andrea(her character in Girl) previously, and for perhaps a split second, maybe she did, but for most of the film she performs like a High School senior with dual 800 SAT scores in an intro to algebra class. The part is so simple for her that she doesn't have to work for it, and this seems to come through in the character.One must also look at the films other two notable &quot;stars&quot; Kathy Griffitn and Joan Rivers.Griffin actually provides the best performance of the cast and well she should as the part she was cast in seems tailor-made for her trademark style of humor. She provides a bit of 1-dimensional sarcasm aimed at the fashion world in which the film takes place. Her delivery combined to the script provide just the right touch of sarcastic humor. Any more would have annoyed the audience and detracted from the film, any less would have slowed down the film and called attention to the mediocre portrayal of other characters.Joan Rivers on the other hand also plays a somewhat exagerrated version of herself (if that is even possible).. Sadly her character is so weak and her portrayal so obvious that she all but gives away the plot of the rest of the film in her first scene. I will refrain from mentioning her further now to keep from spoiling the film myself.The story is a simple one. Almost too simple. There are too many obviously perfect situations set up. At the risk of giving a small spoiler, Jocelyn's love interest Paul (portrayed by Ben Pullen) is predestined from his first appearance when another character tells us that he is the only heterosexual male in the film. In perhaps the saddest moment in the film, Swain looks into the camera and says &quot;He's straight?&quot; and nearly begins to drool right then and there.That said, the story isn't so simplistic as to not be enjoyable. The film presents a cute little love story with a mystery subplot that the viewer can be sure will all be tied up in a bow in 90 short minutes. Perhaps it is accomplishing everything that it intended to accomplish; providing the viewer with a mild amusing hour and a half to fill a Sunday evening. Sadly I was hoping for so much more.One final word of caution. The film opens with an absolutely ridiculous musical number. Just sit tight and bide your time. It will end soon and never be mentioned again.",3,Can a movie be disappointing without being bad?,983145600,"02 26, 2001",2001,3145,"['ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'much', 'was', 'quot', 'bad', 'quot', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'what', 'was', 'Sadly', 'was', 'just', 'expecting', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'it.I', 'bought', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'impressed', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'last', 'several', 'rolls', 'Indeed', 'wrote', 'glowing', 'review', 'film', 'Girl', 'movie', 'where', 'felt', 'Ms', 'Swain', 'grew', 'as', 'much', 'actress', 'character', 'did', 'woman', 'Furthermore', 'Swain', 'always', 'impressed', 'be', 'initial', 'starring', 'role', 'remake', 'Lolita', 'smaller', 'supporting', 'role', 'Face/Off.Sadly', 'Intern', 'showcase', 'talent', 'Swain', 'not', 'put', 'poor', 'performance', 't', 'seem', 'be', 'working', 'role', 'either', 'coast', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'felt', 'would', 'lose', 'Jocelyn', 'intern', 'had', 'lost', 'Andrea', 'character', 'Girl', 'previously', 'perhaps', 'split', 'second', 'maybe', 'did', 'most', 'film', 'High', 'School', 'senior', 'dual', '800', 'SAT', 'scores', 'intro', 'algebra', 'class', 'part', 'so', 'simple', ""n't"", 'have', 'work', 'come', 'character.One', 'must', 'also', 'look', 'films', 'other', 'two', 'notable', 'quot', 'stars', 'quot', 'Kathy', 'Griffitn', 'Joan', 'Rivers.Griffin', 'actually', 'best', 'performance', 'cast', 'well', 'should', 'part', 'was', 'cast', 'tailor-made', 'trademark', 'style', 'humor', 'bit', '1-dimensional', 'sarcasm', 'aimed', 'fashion', 'world', 'film', 'place', 'delivery', 'combined', 'script', 'provide', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'annoyed', 'audience', 'detracted', 'film', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'slowed', 'down', 'film', 'called', 'attention', 'mediocre', 'portrayal', 'other', 'characters.Joan', 'Rivers', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'somewhat', 'exagerrated', 'version', 'herself', 'even', 'possible', '..', 'Sadly', 'character', 'so', 'weak', 'portrayal', 'so', 'obvious', 'away', 'plot', 'rest', 'film', 'first', 'scene', 'will', 'refrain', 'mentioning', 'further', 'now', 'keep', 'spoiling', 'film', 'myself.The', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'Almost', 'too', 'simple', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'obviously', 'perfect', 'situations', 'set', 'up', 'risk', 'giving', 'small', 'spoiler', 'Jocelyn', 'love', 'interest', 'Paul', 'portrayed', 'Ben', 'Pullen', 'predestined', 'first', 'appearance', 'when', 'character', 'only', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'film', 'perhaps', 'saddest', 'moment', 'film', 'Swain', 'camera', 'quot', 'straight', 'quot', 'nearly', 'begins', 'drool', 'right', 'then', 'there.That', 'said', 'story', ""n't"", 'so', 'simplistic', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'cute', 'little', 'love', 'story', 'mystery', 'subplot', 'viewer', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'tied', 'up', 'bow', '90', 'short', 'minutes', 'Perhaps', 'accomplishing', 'everything', 'intended', 'accomplish', 'providing', 'viewer', 'mild', 'amusing', 'hour', 'half', 'fill', 'Sunday', 'evening', 'Sadly', 'was', 'hoping', 'so', 'much', 'more.One', 'final', 'word', 'caution', 'film', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'musical', 'number', 'Just', 'sit', 'tight', 'bide', 'time', 'will', 'end', 'soon', 'never', 'be', 'mentioned', 'again']",N/A

It is my opinion that this movie is worth watching to the end.I know this a silly movie. I know the acting isn't the best. But I love this movie. The acting is so over the top and quasi-serious (or is that really how people in the fashion industry talk and act?!). I think that the only way to truly enjoy this movie is if you don't take it seriously.The celebrity guest spots are fabulous - especially Joan Rivers. If you are skeptical about the movie and not too amused, you can't help but guffaw when she hits the screen (at least I couldn't).The love story is predictable yet cute ... The whole Eurie (sp?) thing is a bit annoying, but it's almost worth sitting through that part of the plot when it's finally discovered who it is. Some subplots are interesting, others would have been better off as deleted scenes (if I recall, this DVD has no special features aside from interactive menus and the like).So, I shall reiterate: If you are to enjoy this movie, you can't take it seriously.

I watched this because ""Dominique Swain"" is one of the stars; she is the only one associated with this thing who has actually been able to find real work in the industry since its release. This was her first real career stumble and she probably wishes now that she had used an assumed name and worn a mask.Imagine film students Leah and Vincenzo from the cable show ""Film School"" (The Tisch School of the Acts at NYU) collaborating on a feature length pseudo-documentary as their class project. They talk Swain into going with them to a New York City fashion magazine office for a couple of days. They tell the office staff that everyone has won a free week of acting for the camera lessons. They get another $10,000 from Parker and Jennifer to buy film (Parker's Visa card again), and reuse their script from 1999 when they made the unwatchable (and fortunately unwatched) ""Fashionably LA"".Apparently the objective of the screenplay is to show the ""real world"" of fashion modeling through the eyes of an intern. The intern is played nicely by Swain who manages to inject some wry humor into many of her scenes and to somehow restrain herself from totally overwhelming the inexperienced cast around her (hence two stars instead of one).The problem is that the premise, ""blowing the lid off the fashion magazine scene"", is of interest only to insiders who already know everything the film is about to reveal. Which is pretty much the same with any vocation. What next, a movie that ""blows the lid off the Cincinnati CPA scene""?Then again, what do I know?

Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[2, 2]","Bad reviews abound for this straight-to-video feature - lot's of ugly sniping about the fashion business, gay stereotypes, superficiality, etc. But, please, let's get real here. Not every movie has to have deep subtext and meaning - especially not movies about the fashion business. Written and executive produced by Jill Kopelman, (daughter of the owner of the House of Chanel) and Caroline Doyle, the inside jokes and cameos run rampant in a movie that just misses being very clever. With a dreary romantic comedy subplot, Dominique Swain, most notable for *Lolita*, plays Jocelyn, an intern at *Skirt* magazine, who becomes involved in fashion espionage. A very thin premise, to be sure, with a John Waters-ish feel to it, but with a breathless E! TV approach to fashion and comedy. Also like a John Waters film, *Intern* depends heavily on onscreen slapstick and cameo performances- though since it's not John Waters, of course, we miss seeing Patty Hearst. Peggy Lipton is a pleasant surprise as Fashion Editor, Roxanne Rochet, a typical fashion victim, given to such statements as ""Forget the herbal wrap - I want a Himalayan rejuvenation lichen-berry acid peel."" She and her staff are complete caricatures of fashionistas (they are devoting nine pages of their current issue to making wheelchairs the chic accessory), but they are right on the money - especially Leilani Bishop as the vacuous, self-absorbed supermodel, and David Deblinger as the queeny art director. Paulina Porizkova, Anna Thompson, and comedienne Kathy Griffin are a little one-dimensional, but funny as well. Joan Rivers is Joan Rivers, and that's all we need to say about that. As stated earlier, it's not a particularly deep movie, but to paraphrase Karl Lagerfeld, fashion is not the same thing as feeding the hungry and curing the ill.",3,Give It A Break,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,1817,"['Bad', 'abound', 'straight-to-video', 'feature', 'lot', 'ugly', 'sniping', 'fashion', 'business', 'gay', 'stereotypes', 'superficiality', 'etc', 'please', 'let', 'get', 'real', 'here', 'Not', 'movie', 'have', 'deep', 'subtext', 'meaning', 'especially', 'not', 'movies', 'fashion', 'business', 'Written', 'executive', 'produced', 'Jill', 'Kopelman', 'daughter', 'owner', 'House', 'Chanel', 'Caroline', 'Doyle', 'inside', 'jokes', 'cameos', 'run', 'rampant', 'movie', 'just', 'being', 'very', 'clever', 'dreary', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'subplot', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'most', 'notable', '*Lolita*', 'Jocelyn', 'intern', '*Skirt*', 'magazine', 'who', 'involved', 'fashion', 'espionage', 'very', 'thin', 'premise', 'be', 'sure', 'John', 'Waters-ish', 'feel', 'breathless', 'E', 'TV', 'approach', 'fashion', 'comedy', 'Also', 'John', 'Waters', 'film', '*Intern*', 'heavily', 'onscreen', 'slapstick', 'cameo', 'performances-', 'not', 'John', 'Waters', 'course', 'miss', 'seeing', 'Patty', 'Hearst', 'Peggy', 'Lipton', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Fashion', 'Editor', 'Roxanne', 'Rochet', 'typical', 'fashion', 'victim', 'given', 'such', 'statements', 'Forget', 'herbal', 'wrap', 'want', 'Himalayan', 'rejuvenation', 'lichen-berry', 'acid', 'peel', 'staff', 'are', 'complete', 'caricatures', 'fashionistas', 'are', 'devoting', 'nine', 'pages', 'current', 'issue', 'making', 'chic', 'accessory', 'are', 'right', 'money', 'especially', 'Leilani', 'Bishop', 'vacuous', 'self-absorbed', 'supermodel', 'David', 'Deblinger', 'queeny', 'art', 'director', 'Paulina', 'Porizkova', 'Anna', 'Thompson', 'comedienne', 'Kathy', 'Griffin', 'are', 'little', 'one-dimensional', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'need', 'say', 'stated', 'earlier', 'not', 'particularly', 'deep', 'movie', 'paraphrase', 'Karl', 'Lagerfeld', 'fashion', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'feeding', 'hungry', 'curing', 'ill']",N/A
