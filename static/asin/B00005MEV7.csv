665458,A22UCQ7WIYIJE3,B00005MEV7,A. J. Cherrington,"[5, 9]","I was 10 when this TV mini series screened way back in 1983, the twentieth anniversry of JFK's death. The fact that my parents allowed me to watch this was to give me an understanding of a person I grew to admire, and still do to this day...Despite all of his flaws.This mini series was cutting edge when it was created and looking back now, was probibly the first attempt to dramatise the little over 1000 days of office JFK had.Martin Sheen, although at the time believed to have been mis-cast for the role, pulls it off well and probibly launched his career proper, and enspired his sons to do the same. No sign of President Bartlett here though.Geraldine Fitzgerald plays a fine Jackie, wearing the infamous pink suit and pill pox hat for any actor these days is always tinged with ominous dread and sadness.John Shea plays the all important Bobby role and with Vincent Gardenia as J Edgar Hoover, it great to see these two men playing off each other.Because of the fact that it was only twenty years since JFKs death and the fact that sensitivity was still needed towards Jackie and the reamaining Kennedy's, many of JFKs shortcommings were ""papered"" over and his private peccadillos were only touched on, with Gardenia's Hoover playing off them.  Hoover is slightly mis-represented here as an aging surly dictator director of his FBI, hiding his own insecurities and sexualy. His obsession with the Kennedy clan was well known by 1983, however I feel that it was played on too much.World events of the time are given due credit, including Vietnam and Cuba, but also the Civil Rights movement that inflammed its self during JFKs short reign.Special Features of the DVD set include four short documentries and the last one called ""The Last Two Days"" shows the moments leading up to and including the assasination, as well as the infamous radio report.Extended scenes DOES make for a longer miniseries, some of it not needed. But considering it's now the 21st century and some of the goals set by JFK himself still unachieved, this DVD set makes for a nostelgia trip back to 1983.  A miniseries made in it's time, a time still with unreleased information, without morphing actors into live scenes and a good attempt to get a handle on a president that meant so much to so many for such a short time.",4,An Aged Masterpiece,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,2302,"['was', '10', 'when', 'TV', 'mini', 'series', 'screened', 'way', 'back', '1983', 'twentieth', 'anniversry', 'JFK', 'death', 'fact', 'parents', 'allowed', 'watch', 'was', 'give', 'understanding', 'person', 'grew', 'admire', 'still', 'do', 'day', 'flaws.This', 'mini', 'series', 'was', 'cutting', 'edge', 'when', 'was', 'created', 'looking', 'back', 'now', 'was', 'probibly', 'first', 'attempt', 'dramatise', 'little', '1000', 'days', 'office', 'JFK', 'had.Martin', 'Sheen', 'time', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'mis-cast', 'role', 'off', 'well', 'probibly', 'launched', 'career', 'proper', 'enspired', 'sons', 'do', 'same', 'sign', 'President', 'Bartlett', 'here', 'though.Geraldine', 'Fitzgerald', 'fine', 'Jackie', 'wearing', 'infamous', 'pink', 'suit', 'pill', 'pox', 'hat', 'actor', 'days', 'always', 'tinged', 'ominous', 'dread', 'sadness.John', 'Shea', 'important', 'Bobby', 'role', 'Vincent', 'Gardenia', 'J', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'great', 'see', 'two', 'men', 'playing', 'off', 'other.Because', 'fact', 'was', 'only', 'twenty', 'years', 'JFKs', 'death', 'fact', 'sensitivity', 'was', 'still', 'needed', 'towards', 'Jackie', 'reamaining', 'Kennedy', 'many', 'JFKs', 'shortcommings', 'were', 'papered', 'private', 'peccadillos', 'were', 'only', 'touched', 'Gardenia', 'Hoover', 'playing', 'off', 'Hoover', 'slightly', 'mis-represented', 'here', 'aging', 'surly', 'dictator', 'director', 'FBI', 'hiding', 'own', 'insecurities', 'sexualy', 'obsession', 'Kennedy', 'clan', 'was', 'well', 'known', '1983', 'however', 'feel', 'was', 'played', 'too', 'much.World', 'events', 'time', 'are', 'given', 'due', 'credit', 'including', 'Vietnam', 'Cuba', 'also', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'inflammed', 'self', 'JFKs', 'short', 'reign.Special', 'Features', 'DVD', 'set', 'include', 'four', 'short', 'documentries', 'last', 'one', 'called', 'Last', 'Two', 'Days', 'moments', 'leading', 'up', 'including', 'assasination', 'as', 'well', 'infamous', 'radio', 'report.Extended', 'scenes', 'DOES', 'make', 'longer', 'miniseries', 'not', 'needed', 'considering', 'now', '21st', 'century', 'goals', 'set', 'JFK', 'still', 'unachieved', 'DVD', 'set', 'nostelgia', 'trip', 'back', '1983', 'miniseries', 'made', 'time', 'time', 'still', 'unreleased', 'information', 'morphing', 'actors', 'live', 'scenes', 'good', 'attempt', 'get', 'handle', 'president', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'such', 'short', 'time']",Kennedy
665459,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00005MEV7,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","The five hour miniseries KENNEDY (UK/USA-1983) stars Martin Sheen as John F. Kennedy.It opens on 11/22/63, with the first reports of a shooting in Dallas and how these news flashes affect various people. After the official word of JFK's death is given, there's a flashback to the 1960 election, and that's the story's actual starting point. By 45 minutes in and with John Kennedy in office a short while, FBI head J. Edgar Hoover (Vincent Gardenia) is introduced as a cartoonish furrow-browed anti-Kennedy family villain.As history this miniseries clearly distorts and has a political axe to grind, yet at least Blair Brown looks and is terrific as wife Jackie.Also with John Shea, who DOESN'T resemble brother Bobby, the zealous Atty. Gen'l, Geraldine Fitzgerald and E.G. Marshall as JFK's parents, Kevin Conroy, another poor choice as Ted Kennedy, and a minor role for Kelsey Grammar as Stephen Smith, JFK's brother-in-law.One example of historic inaccuracy concerns would-be dynamite assassin Richard Paul Pavlick. This film gives his age as 36. Pavlik was actually 73 when he stalked the President-elect in Palm Bch., FL.. Perhaps such an old man wouldn't seem enough of a threat?Most frustrating is the way the Civil Rights struggles of 1961 are handled. We see Freedom Riders beat bloody by gangs of white Alabama thugs. Martin Luther King rightly wants to know just what the Kennedy Administration will do to stop this violence against American citizens both black and white. As matters escalate, Atty. Gen'l. Bobby Kennedy angrily vows to send 400 Federal marshals into Alabama, 50 alone to protect Rev. King.Rioters outside a church service presided over by Dr. King overturn a car and set it afire; they throw rocks through the church's stained glass windows. Everyone in the building are prisoners of a mob. During all this madness, King reaches RFK in Washington and he demands action. We see no resolution to this and nothing more of the Freedom Riders or 400 marshals. It's as if this lengthy section of the story never happened.Seminal events in the thousand days of JFK's presidency are capsulized, also some family tragedies, plus we see J. Edgar's gleeful monitoring of an unnamed woman (Judith Exner), who supposedly consorts with both mobsters and the Commander in Chief. In five hours a lot is covered, yet almost every situation has important details missing, thus this work gets a merely adequate rating.",3,The TV docudrama meatgrinder cranks out another faux-history sausage,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,2427,"['five', 'hour', 'miniseries', 'KENNEDY', 'UK/USA-1983', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy.It', '11/22/63', 'first', 'reports', 'shooting', 'Dallas', 'how', 'news', 'flashes', 'affect', 'various', 'people', 'official', 'word', 'JFK', 'death', 'given', 'flashback', '1960', 'election', 'story', 'actual', 'starting', 'point', '45', 'minutes', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'office', 'short', 'while', 'FBI', 'head', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'Vincent', 'Gardenia', 'introduced', 'cartoonish', 'furrow-browed', 'anti-Kennedy', 'family', 'villain.As', 'history', 'clearly', 'distorts', 'political', 'axe', 'grind', 'yet', 'least', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'looks', 'terrific', 'wife', 'Jackie.Also', 'John', 'Shea', 'who', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'resemble', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'zealous', 'Atty', 'Gen', 'l', 'Geraldine', 'Fitzgerald', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'JFK', 'parents', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'poor', 'choice', 'Ted', 'Kennedy', 'minor', 'role', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'Stephen', 'Smith', 'JFK', 'brother-in-law.One', 'example', 'historic', 'inaccuracy', 'concerns', 'would-be', 'dynamite', 'assassin', 'Richard', 'Paul', 'Pavlick', 'film', 'age', '36', 'Pavlik', 'was', 'actually', '73', 'when', 'stalked', 'President-elect', 'Palm', 'Bch.', 'FL..', 'Perhaps', 'old', 'man', 'would', ""n't"", 'seem', 'enough', 'threat', 'Most', 'frustrating', 'way', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'struggles', '1961', 'are', 'handled', 'see', 'Freedom', 'Riders', 'beat', 'bloody', 'gangs', 'white', 'Alabama', 'thugs', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'rightly', 'know', 'just', 'what', 'Kennedy', 'Administration', 'will', 'do', 'stop', 'violence', 'American', 'citizens', 'black', 'white', 'matters', 'escalate', 'Atty', 'Gen', 'l', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'angrily', 'send', '400', 'Federal', 'marshals', 'Alabama', '50', 'alone', 'protect', 'Rev', 'King.Rioters', 'church', 'service', 'presided', 'over', 'Dr.', 'King', 'overturn', 'car', 'set', 'afire', 'throw', 'rocks', 'church', 'stained', 'glass', 'windows', 'Everyone', 'building', 'are', 'prisoners', 'mob', 'madness', 'King', 'RFK', 'Washington', 'action', 'see', 'resolution', 'nothing', 'more', 'Freedom', 'Riders', '400', 'marshals', 'lengthy', 'section', 'story', 'never', 'happened.Seminal', 'events', 'thousand', 'days', 'JFK', 'presidency', 'are', 'capsulized', 'also', 'family', 'tragedies', 'see', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'gleeful', 'monitoring', 'unnamed', 'woman', 'Judith', 'Exner', 'who', 'supposedly', 'mobsters', 'Commander', 'Chief', 'five', 'hours', 'lot', 'covered', 'yet', 'almost', 'situation', 'important', 'details', 'missing', 'thus', 'work', 'merely', 'adequate', 'rating']",Kennedy

Smith,"[20, 24]","Being from Massachusetts, I can say that the attempted Kennedy accents in this 1983 miniseries are occassionally almost accurate, never entirely perfect, and sometimes just plain awful. Still, the writing and acting here are pretty good for a TV movie of this vintage. Some parts go on way too long, such as the Bay of Pig and civil rights segments, and J. Edgar Hoover is creepy sometimes, but mostly just over the top. Resemblances are uncanny, though, to the real Hoover and Jackie Kennedy. Martin Sheen as JFK is close, but no cigar.

It grabs your attention with Blair Brown's recital of Alan Seeger's ""I Have a Rendezvous with Death""; (which according to the JFK Library was one of his favorites, and he would often ask Jackie to read it in the evening,) and keeps it right through to the shots fired. One is caught up in the lives of this family; that even though you know when and where the assassination takes place, it is still a bit of a shock. Martin Sheen brings another dimension to JFK; one which often gets lost in the writings of the media. You see the relationship between Jack and Jackie from a different perspective; one that I believe is correct, she was no mouse, but after Patrick's death it is well known that they were closer than they had ever been, and these two bring that to life. All of the actors rise to the occasion; but it is Sheen and Brown that truly shine. I was thrilled to find it available on DVD.

I recall seeing this mini-series when it originally aired in November 1983, exactly 20 years after JFK's tragic assassination. It's now great to have it available on DVD.All the major elements that made up the presidency of John F. Kennedy are explored very nicely during this five-hour program, including the Bay Of Pigs invasion of April 1961 and the ultra-frightening Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.""Kennedy"" star Martin Sheen, who portrays President Kennedy here,  is certainly no stranger to playing Kennedys. Prior to this 1983 TV mini-series, Martin was cast as Attorney General Robert Kennedy in the 1974 telefilm, ""The Missiles Of October"" (opposite William Devane's portrayal of JFK).In another ""Kennedy connection"", Sheen played Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach in the 2003 film, ""The Commission"", which explores The Warren Commission's examination into President Kennedy's 1963 assassination.Mr. Sheen is probably now best-known for playing fictional ""President Bartlet"" on the NBC-TV drama, ""The West Wing"".A major reason I purchased this DVD product was for the extra features included on Disc 2. Here, we get to see the real JFK in action, in a series of documentaries and historic film footage. These extras total 75 minutes, making this 2-Disc package a completely absorbing and satisfying experience for anyone who wants to look back into history at one of the most popular men ever to occupy The White House.The four bonus programs on the second disc of this set are:>> JFK's Inaugural Address to the nation (January 1961).>> ""One Week In October"" -- A half-hour film produced in 1964 by the Department Of Defense about the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Lots of archival film footage detailing the events surrounding the Missile Crisis is included here. It's a good, concise overview of those terrifying days in October '62.>> ""One Day In Berlin"" -- Excerpts of the speech JFK made at the Berlin Wall.>> ""The Last Two Days"" -- A 19-minute color film chronicling the last two days of President Kennedy's life in November of 1963.",5,2-Disc Set ....

665466,A9MAUO67ABVOB,B00005MEV7,"F. Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[5, 6]","I strongly urge you to begin your view of the DVD International release of &quot;Kennedy&quot; with Part 3 at the start of the second disc. Here we relivewhat we went through when Cuba was armed with missiles by the Soviet Union and Kennedy was reported to have done what he could to prevent a knee-jerk invasion of the island as some were advocating. It is simply chilling to have seen that sequence at this time in our country's history. (This is being written one month after Sept. 11, 2001.)This five-hour film appeared on NBC as a special in 1983. I cannot vouch for the absolute accuracy of the events reproduced here or certainly not for the characterizations. The private conversations are, of course, to be taken as historical fiction; but the acting is on such a high level that one can readily believe these very words were spoken at the times portrayed in the film.Martin Sheen makes a totally crdible &quot;Jack&quot; Kennedy, although he seems to be alone in his family for having that famous accent. He is hardly ever off-screen and has been directed to show the character, if not warts and all, at least as a human being trying to juggle several insurmountable problems (civil rights, Viet Nam, Cuba, and J. Edgar Hoover) all at once. His womanizing is reduced to a single female voice on a telephone; and Marilyn Monroe is mentioned only once in another context. His constant statements that he &quot;cannot&quot; remove Hoover from the FBI seem to imply many other skeletons in his closet, but this is interpretation.Hoover (Vincent Gardenia) is shown as a cross between Ming the Merciless and something out of &quot;Star Wars,&quot; totally obsessed as he is with gaining power of the country by having files on just about every one of consequence. His own perversions, explicit in future film recreations, are here only implied.The Bobby Kennedy of John Shea is your all-American that even Hoover cannot fault morally although the latter will keep insisting that Organized Crime does not exist in America. E.G. Marshall and Geraldine Fiztgerald make a fine Joseph and Rose Kennedy, both unable (like most parents) to see anything negative about their children or anything positive about any of their opponents.Blair Brown's Jackie in this script seems simply an airhead, more concerned with buying expensive gowns and redecorating a White House that will not hold her for more than 1000 days. Perhaps the real woman was like this; I do not know. But Brown does a marvelous job playing a vacuous fashion-plate whose popularity often exceeded that of her husband.The scenes of how Blacks and Freedom Riders were treated down south are nauseatingly graphic; and I plan never to watch that part of this video again. There MUST have been some citizens of those states who did not think or act in that barbaric way, but they are noticeably absent from these sequences.You will be interested in comparing the four special features with the film's versions of them: The Inaugural Address, One Day in Berlin, The Last Two Days (the Dallas trip), and One Week in October (the Missile Crisis).

665478,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B00005MEV7,Luke Killion,"[3, 3]","This 1983 7 part mini series is a take on the Kennedy adminstration that is somewhat lost to the  modern era; despite Martin Sheen's amazing career (which continues into current productions), this made for TV portrait of America's most controversial president is rather obscure. It certainly has not been played on TV recently and I only came across it at the local library. I did not have the highest expectations for it, yet I was quite surprised not only by the ability to capture the spirit of an enigmatic statesman, but also the excellent summarization of a tumultuous era in American history.Even though JFK is one of the most studied presidents of all time, there has not been all that many depictions of him on screen. Just recently, Greg Kinnear attempted the role on the much maligned mini series which the Kennedy family (and their powerful contacts) ran off of the History channel, relagating it to Reelz, only known to me because it happens to be two channels up from AMC on Fios. I can't say that I watched much of the recent edition (seeing a crewcut Berry Pepper as Bobby Kennedy kind of lost me), but I would find it hard to top this production made in 1983, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the assassination.Sheen is the obvious element to this story that makes it all work. As the lead in any presidential biopic, the resemblance (both physically and verbally) must be somewhat accurate or the story really suffers as a result. Sheen has perhaps the best Kennedy impersonation of any producion out there; I think he really had a strong sense of what JFK was all about, not just the strengths, but his weaknesses as well. Though this series is definately gauged for pro Kennedy viewers, as it focuses on the many hardships Jack endured and triumphed over, (Sheen shows the calm and flippant charm Jack displayed in the face of danger) there are also insinuations about the secrets of Kennedy or as Seymour Hirsch put it, the ""dark side of Camelot.""The main vehicle for the unveiling of scandalous personal behavior (though the writer gives Jack the benefit of the doubt and minimizes its effect) is done through Vincent Gardenia as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Gardenia is by far the best supporting actor (along with John Shea as Attorney General Bobby Kennedy), despite the fact that there are relatively few scenes where Sheen and Gardenia are on screen together.  Gardenia's first scene, which opens the second episode is one of the strongest points made in this mini series about the duality of the Kennedy's. The first episode shows the lighter side and charisma that appeared on the surface to the American public. Gardenia opens the next episode in a shadowy FBI conference room with a monologue on the various scandals of both Jack and his father, most having to do with sex. This is an obvious implication about the web of secrecy and back biting that was prevalent after the Kennedy brothers created a whole host of possible foes that would like to see them out of office, among them the Mafia, Communists the world around, the KKK and the CIA, particularly the anti Castro wing and even J. Edgar Hoover himself (who's clash with the upstart Bobby is very well documented).This is not what the film is about, as it is a far cry from Oliver Stone's 1991 conspiracy flick ""JFK"". This movie is based on the accomplishments of Jack and Bobby Kennedy working together as President and Attorney General, such as the desegragation of the American south and dealing with the fallout from the Bay of Pigs fiasco before the ultimate triumph of the Cuban Missle Crisis, as Jack and Bobby found a third way to deal with the Russians; they did not need to attack or retreat, rather they tactfully negotiated proving to be as flexible on a path to peace as they were resolved to stand up to Communist aggression. This series is by no means a definitive statment about Jack that includes the entirety of his presidency. Although there is a decent enough supporting cast, it is Sheen who really carries this piece and rises it above a mere TV political soap opera. He is clearly a student of the Kennedy's and his preformance does a great service to the memory of a tragic president, one who was willing to walk the walk of a man who took change upon himself, and paid a dear price for his controversial decisions.",4,Powerful preformance by Martin Sheen as JFK,1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,4335,"['1983', '7', 'part', 'mini', 'series', 'take', 'Kennedy', 'adminstration', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'modern', 'era', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'amazing', 'career', 'current', 'productions', 'made', 'TV', 'portrait', 'America', 'most', 'controversial', 'president', 'rather', 'obscure', 'certainly', 'not', 'been', 'played', 'TV', 'recently', 'only', 'came', 'local', 'library', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'highest', 'expectations', 'yet', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'not', 'only', 'ability', 'capture', 'spirit', 'enigmatic', 'statesman', 'also', 'excellent', 'summarization', 'tumultuous', 'era', 'American', 'history.Even', 'JFK', 'one', 'most', 'studied', 'presidents', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'many', 'depictions', 'screen', 'Just', 'recently', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'attempted', 'role', 'much', 'maligned', 'mini', 'series', 'Kennedy', 'family', 'powerful', 'contacts', 'ran', 'History', 'channel', 'relagating', 'Reelz', 'only', 'known', 'be', 'two', 'channels', 'AMC', 'Fios', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'watched', 'much', 'recent', 'edition', 'seeing', 'crewcut', 'Berry', 'Pepper', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'kind', 'lost', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'top', 'production', 'made', '1983', 'commemorating', '20th', 'anniversary', 'assassination.Sheen', 'obvious', 'element', 'story', 'work', 'lead', 'presidential', 'biopic', 'resemblance', 'physically', 'verbally', 'must', 'be', 'somewhat', 'accurate', 'story', 'really', 'result', 'Sheen', 'perhaps', 'best', 'Kennedy', 'impersonation', 'producion', 'there', 'think', 'really', 'had', 'strong', 'sense', 'what', 'JFK', 'was', 'about', 'not', 'just', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'definately', 'gauged', 'pro', 'Kennedy', 'viewers', 'many', 'hardships', 'Jack', 'endured', 'triumphed', 'over', 'Sheen', 'calm', 'flippant', 'charm', 'Jack', 'displayed', 'face', 'danger', 'are', 'also', 'insinuations', 'secrets', 'Kennedy', 'Seymour', 'Hirsch', 'put', 'dark', 'side', 'Camelot', 'main', 'vehicle', 'unveiling', 'scandalous', 'personal', 'behavior', 'writer', 'Jack', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'effect', 'done', 'Vincent', 'Gardenia', 'FBI', 'Director', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'Gardenia', 'far', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'John', 'Shea', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'fact', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'Sheen', 'Gardenia', 'are', 'screen', 'together', 'Gardenia', 'first', 'scene', 'second', 'episode', 'one', 'strongest', 'points', 'made', 'mini', 'series', 'duality', 'Kennedy', 'first', 'episode', 'lighter', 'side', 'charisma', 'appeared', 'surface', 'American', 'public', 'Gardenia', 'next', 'episode', 'shadowy', 'FBI', 'conference', 'room', 'monologue', 'various', 'scandals', 'Jack', 'father', 'most', 'having', 'do', 'sex', 'obvious', 'implication', 'web', 'secrecy', 'back', 'biting', 'was', 'prevalent', 'Kennedy', 'brothers', 'created', 'whole', 'host', 'possible', 'foes', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'office', 'Mafia', 'world', 'around', 'KKK', 'CIA', 'particularly', 'anti', 'Castro', 'wing', 'even', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'who', 'clash', 'upstart', 'Bobby', 'very', 'well', 'documented', '.This', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'far', 'cry', 'Oliver', 'Stone', '1991', 'conspiracy', 'flick', 'JFK', 'movie', 'based', 'accomplishments', 'Jack', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'working', 'together', 'President', 'Attorney', 'General', 'such', 'desegragation', 'American', 'south', 'dealing', 'fallout', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'fiasco', 'ultimate', 'triumph', 'Cuban', 'Missle', 'Crisis', 'Jack', 'Bobby', 'found', 'third', 'way', 'deal', 'Russians', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'attack', 'retreat', 'rather', 'tactfully', 'negotiated', 'proving', 'be', 'flexible', 'path', 'peace', 'were', 'resolved', 'stand', 'up', 'Communist', 'aggression', 'series', 'definitive', 'statment', 'Jack', 'entirety', 'presidency', 'decent', 'enough', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Sheen', 'who', 'really', 'piece', 'mere', 'TV', 'political', 'soap', 'opera', 'clearly', 'student', 'Kennedy', 'preformance', 'great', 'service', 'memory', 'tragic', 'president', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'walk', 'walk', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'change', 'paid', 'dear', 'price', 'controversial', 'decisions']",Kennedy

This is not like a dual-layer pause but an actual slowing of the film and then a burst of speed to &quot;catch up.&quot;  It is only slightly irritating and does not warrant you not purchasing it, since it is only a minor problem.  Overall, I was quite surprised to see the film and audio to be as crisp and vibrant as it appears.
