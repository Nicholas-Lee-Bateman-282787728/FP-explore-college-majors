1532569,A1DB4U8ISVULVE,B007K7IASA,Bill Smith,"[2, 25]","Lets face it, some guys dig on watching half naked athletic looking men running around a jungle in a loincloth. Franky Murillo does a good job explaining the appeal of this Tarzan series in his review. The color transfers and detail of this show really allow the interested viewer to appreciate the sweaty physique of the jungle man in all his half naked glory. Fans will revel in the actions of our masculine hero as he runs down bad guys with nothing but a tiny little loincloth covering the junk. And you gotta admire how he tends to shun women and play with his chimp alot. I can see why Murillo and others are big fans. For all those that appreciate the wind whistling through the unrestricted goods in the freedom of the wild jungle, you can't go wrong with this package. No wonder Tarzan was constantly yelling out ""Oooooooooooooooooeeeeeeoooooooooeeeeeeeeeoooooooooooooooo!!!"" These Dvds are for real fellas who like to shed their Bobby Brooks brothers suits and run around in their backyard with only a loincloth on!",3,"If you love watching an athletic man running around in a loincloth, this is for you",1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,1025,"['Lets', 'face', 'guys', 'dig', 'watching', 'half', 'naked', 'athletic', 'looking', 'men', 'running', 'around', 'jungle', 'loincloth', 'Franky', 'Murillo', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'appeal', 'Tarzan', 'series', 'review', 'color', 'transfers', 'detail', 'show', 'really', 'allow', 'interested', 'viewer', 'appreciate', 'sweaty', 'physique', 'jungle', 'man', 'half', 'naked', 'glory', 'Fans', 'will', 'revel', 'actions', 'masculine', 'hero', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'nothing', 'tiny', 'little', 'covering', 'junk', 'got', 'ta', 'admire', 'how', 'shun', 'women', 'play', 'chimp', 'alot', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Murillo', 'others', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'appreciate', 'wind', 'whistling', 'unrestricted', 'goods', 'freedom', 'wild', 'jungle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'package', 'wonder', 'Tarzan', 'was', 'constantly', 'yelling', 'out', 'Oooooooooooooooooeeeeeeoooooooooeeeeeeeeeoooooooooooooooo', 'Dvds', 'are', 'real', 'fellas', 'who', 'like', 'shed', 'Bobby', 'Brooks', 'brothers', 'suits', 'run', 'around', 'backyard', 'only', 'loincloth']","Tarzan: Season 1, Part 2"

Sometimes watching the price fluxuations on Amazon is like watching stocks rise and fall. Next week they might be $50.00 each or they might go down to $12.99. I would love to know what causes the constant and super fast fluxuations. I only bought Part One because I wanted to make sure I liked the show....unfortunately I do and now I might be stuck with paying $44.00 or more for the second half of Season One....Damn that's expensive for 1/2 of one season.

1532574,A1M6W196PK37RB,B007K7IASA,I'm Just Saying,"[2, 2]","As delighted as I am that this fine tv series is being resurrected, I find myself increasingly dismayed at the manner in which it's being brought to the marketplace.  This series deserves a proper release on DVD.  Shame or Warner for not doing it right.Still, all in all, I love this show and would be willing to purchase without hesitation.  If I have to accept it on an inferior media, the price should reflect the disc quality. From what I have read, the quality is great on these episodes.  I want to make a clear distinction in what I mean by quality.  I simply mean the quality of a great picture and sound on the DVD-R media won't last for years and years like a regular proper dvd release.  The price should reflect that. Make a backup right away is all I can suggest.  Otherwise, in a few years, long after you would have any right to complain, you will have a disc with skips and has screen freezes.  Don't say you were not warned.  I still want it, but they will have to change the price point quite a bit first.  39.00 USD for half a season on inferior media is just robbery.In any event, put this one on your want list.  It is a great title.  Let's hope Warner will see the error of their ways and give us a proper release.
