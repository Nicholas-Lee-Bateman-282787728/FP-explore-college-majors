1547795,A2BAAKZHSUGCDP,B0087ITBPC,,"[0, 0]","A road trip with an overbearing Jewish mother and her guilt-laden son seems too clich&eacute;d to be entertaining, and for the first one-third of the movie that was true. We learn that Andy (Seth Rogen) and his mom Joyce (Barbara Streisand) don't see each other often because she is a widow and lives alone in New Jersey and he lives in California where he went to college 10 years ago to become a scientist. He has developed a cleaning product and is peddling it across the country to large retailers, without much success, and decides on a whim to invite his mother along on the trip with San Francisco as their final destination. There are predictable scenes where she whips out a coupon at the car rental counter and guilts him into getting the little economy model car rather than the big comfortable SUV. She nags him constantly to drink more water, and worries why he has no current girlfriend. She gives him unwanted advice to help him pitch his product.But eventually, the funny and touching scenes start to mount up; they stop at a strip club when they think they have a flat tire. Joyce downs a huge steak at a cowboy bar in Texas and gets caught up in a slot machine gambling and stays out all night in Las Vegas. Mom has brought along the audio book version of Middlesex, and if there is a more inappropriate book for a mother and son to listen to together, I can't imagine what it might be!Surprisingly, the comedy tables are turned and Barbara Streisand gets all the funny scenes, with Seth Rogen playing the serious straight man. By the midway point of the film, I was cheering for both of them to appreciate each other more and for Andy to find success with his boring cleaning product.The theme of an adult male trying to build a long lasting respectful relationship with his long suffering mother is one that many can relate to. The excellent casting decisions in &#34;Guilt Trip&#34; ensure that an otherwise jaded and perhaps boring premise achieves resonance with the audience.",4,Jewish Mother Shtick Was More Appealing Than Expected,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1999,"['road', 'trip', 'overbearing', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'guilt-laden', 'son', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'be', 'entertaining', 'first', 'one-third', 'movie', 'was', 'true', 'learn', 'Andy', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'mom', 'Joyce', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'often', 'widow', 'alone', 'New', 'Jersey', 'California', 'where', 'went', 'college', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'become', 'scientist', 'developed', 'cleaning', 'product', 'peddling', 'country', 'large', 'retailers', 'much', 'success', 'whim', 'invite', 'mother', 'trip', 'San', 'Francisco', 'final', 'destination', 'are', 'predictable', 'scenes', 'where', 'out', 'coupon', 'car', 'rental', 'counter', 'guilts', 'getting', 'little', 'economy', 'model', 'car', 'rather', 'big', 'comfortable', 'SUV', 'nags', 'constantly', 'drink', 'more', 'water', 'worries', 'why', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'unwanted', 'advice', 'help', 'pitch', 'product.But', 'eventually', 'funny', 'touching', 'scenes', 'start', 'mount', 'up', 'stop', 'strip', 'club', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'flat', 'tire', 'Joyce', 'huge', 'steak', 'cowboy', 'bar', 'Texas', 'caught', 'up', 'slot', 'machine', 'gambling', 'out', 'night', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Mom', 'brought', 'audio', 'book', 'version', 'Middlesex', 'more', 'inappropriate', 'book', 'mother', 'son', 'listen', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'Surprisingly', 'comedy', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'playing', 'serious', 'straight', 'man', 'midway', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'cheering', 'appreciate', 'other', 'more', 'Andy', 'find', 'success', 'boring', 'cleaning', 'product.The', 'theme', 'adult', 'male', 'trying', 'build', 'long', 'lasting', 'respectful', 'relationship', 'long', 'suffering', 'mother', 'one', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'excellent', 'casting', 'decisions', '34', 'Guilt', 'Trip', '34', 'ensure', 'otherwise', 'jaded', 'perhaps', 'boring', 'premise', 'achieves', 'resonance', 'audience']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised that this Seth Rogen movie wasn't bad at all. My 1 star rating is for the piss-poor copy protection - which STOPPED ME FROM WATCHING ON A REGULAR DVD PLAYER! Yes, the DVD case even says ""This DVD is copy protected""Here was my basic experience:Hmm, available used - like new. DVD arrived a few days later in the mail. Pop it out of the case to examine for scratches/smudges - looks pristine. Turn on TV, put the DVD in the player. Hmmm. Nothing happening? What the? Pop disc out and clean with rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball, despite having no smudges or scratches. Put it back in the DVD player - no luck. Pop it out and try it on my computer instead; computer sees the file structure, so tried to watch it. Nope - crashed the video player. Tried another computer. Nope, no luck there either. Attempt to copy folder to hard disk - error. Hmmm.Fire up software to remove copy protection, then copy to hard disk. Works like a charm! Convert to MP4 file, connect computer to TV, and watch the MP4 on full-screen TV. FINALLY.  What a waste of copy protection. Why sell a DVD that I can't even play in a regular DVD player?  So again, as I stare at the back of the DVD case at the words ""This DVD is copy protected"", I am struck by the irony: forced to make a copy to watch it.In the end what did this gain Paramount? A pissed off customer who had to resort to breaking copy protection. I wonder, would this DVD play on ANY DVD player?Again, this was an excellent movie, so don't be put off by the 1 star rating.

1547801,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0087ITBPC,,"[0, 0]","Guilt Trip started off well, hit a pretty bad spot, and then knocked it out of the ballpark at the end. There was just enough humor and just enough Barbara Streisand in good form to make this an enjoyable movie. Seth Rogen was consistently good throughout this whole film - he was a constant.Chemist son is trying to sell his miracle FDA approved cleaner. He isn't very good at it; in fact the opening sales pitch with K-Mart is so bad I felt sorry for the guy. Son decides to head home to see Mom and they ultimately end up on a trip driving from New York to San Francisco via Texas. There are cringe worthy moments, and then there are some very funny moments. The ending was everything in the world; it turned this movie into something special.Barbara Streisand was back to her old self, a great actress being a doting mother. I didn't much care for her in Meet the Fochers, her role was a little too far over the top. In The Guilt Trip she is just exactly enough mother that innocently talks about sex and other things that will embarrass her son. I believed her. Seth Rogen is simply perfect in this film. He isn't that goofy funny guy in most of his films; no he is much more like the husband in Take This Waltz, serious and incredibly well meaning. I wanted him to do well; I wanted him to win in this film. If you expect The 40  Year Old Virgin or Knocked Up, you will be very disappointed. I cared about what happened to both of these characters.This movie isn't as funny as I expected. It had some good jokes, but not the rip roaring laughing I expected. Instead it grew very slowly on me. I was surprised by how much I liked this film.The movie is rated PG-13. This is probably not for younger viewers. There is no nudity. But there is a scene in a strip club. The f-bomb gets thrown once very loudly and with a lot of emphasis by the lovely Barbara Streisand. There is a lot of other strong language. And there are a lot of conversations about sex and adult subjects.I enjoyed this film a lot.

1547815,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0087ITBPC,,"[0, 0]","I took a pass on this film when it was in theaters but recently caught up to it on a drowsy Saturday afternoon.  I wasn't expecting much and certainly from the aspect of seeing something fresh and new I got what I was expecting.  Still I have to admit, I enjoyed Barbra Streisand as a lead actress once again.  And yes she still can be effectively funny.  Here she plays a meddlesome and stereotypical Jewish mother.Living in New Jersey, Joyce is expecting a visit from her only son, Andy (Seth Rogen) who is flying in from California for a business presentation.  Andy, a chemical engineer by trade, has invented a cleaning product that is all organic and has no deadly ingredients.  Unfortunately he gave it a terrible name that is neither pronounceable nor understandable.  Andy can't wait to get away from his loving mom, but when she tells him a sweet story about her first love as a 19 year old, he discovers the man works for a large company in San Francisco.Since Andy has a series of presentations across the country he was going to drive to each.  This whole premise is a borders on ridiculous as it is unlikely that large companies like Costco, K-Mart and a shopping channel are going to listen to this guy who has no track record.  With that out of the way, Joyce insists they save money where they can, since Andy is essentially broke.  So they room together and are bundled up in a Chevy Aero which is just a tad larger than a toaster.Probably the best scenes are in Lubbock, Texas where Joyce takes on the challenge of eating a 4 pound steak with all the trimmings.

1547823,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B0087ITBPC,,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Out of all of the movies I've seen this past week I think this is the one that I expected to like the least. On the contrary, I found the The Guilt Trip to be really, really enjoyable. More enjoyable, in fact, than I ever would have expected it to be. This film's strongest attributes are its charm and relatability. Everyone knows what it's like to have a mother, but this film focuses a lot on the mother/son relationship (obviously). Now I love my mother to death, but there's just something about moms where sometimes they don't know when to stop and we don't know how to tell them that they're being overbearing until we snap. I think this film does a good job of focusing on this concept and the Rogen/Streisand duo do a great job of bringing that relationship to life.The premise is simple really. You follow Andy Brewster (Seth Rogen), a struggling inventor of a new, organic cleaning product. He has to go across country to try and sell this product to big companies in hopes that they will be willing to distribute it in large quantities. Once he learns a secret from his mother Joyce's (Barbra Streisand) past he invites her to come a long. The only thing is she thinks that business is good and he doesn't want to tell her otherwise because he doesn't want her worrying about him. She accepts and you spend the remaining 60-70 minutes following these two across their week-long road trip.As a whole I thought the story was enjoyable, nothing groundbreaking, but it was charming and full of laughs. Upon doing some research I found out that Streisand was nominated for ""Worst Actress"" for this film. 1) I didn't even know that was a thing and 2) I think that's a bit of an overstatement. Streisand is in no way Academy Award material, but it would be wrong to deny that she and Rogen have fantastic chemistry on screen. In a movie like this you need two actors who can emulate that mother/son relationship and these two did it perfectly.This is what ultimately what makes this film enjoyable. We can relate to what is going on in these scenes because we've all been there in some form or another. Maybe it wasn't on a road trip, but the conversations and arguments that are had in this movie are the same ones had by other mother/child relationships daily. The funniest scenes in here are the ones where this dynamic is shown in full force. For example, because she's with him on this road trip she has to go into the buildings with him when he has his meetings. While they're waiting she's rummaging through her purse, making a bunch of noise, playing loud games on her phone, and wishing him good luck as he's walking away. I think it's one of those things that no matter how old you get you're always going to feel slightly embarrassed by your mother.The casting is relatively small in here. The focus is mainly on Rogen and Streisand so don't expect to see a huge group of familiar faces. Most of the supporting cast comes and goes in a matter of minutes. However, there are two other characters who play a pretty major role in the story. Without giving away their roles you have Brett Cullen playing Ben Graw and Adam Scott playing Andrew Margolis, Jr. Still, even these two are only in here for maybe three minutes each. Because Rogen and Streisand are the main focus their performances could make or break the film. Luckily they both did a solid job. Rogen is back with another semi-serious role and I think I'm starting to enjoy seeing this side of him. Streisand, as previously mentioned, wasn't exceptional, but she played her part well and that's all that matters.Overall Score: 8/10 - Depending on who you are there's a lot of fun to be had in The Guilt Trip. It's one of those rare comedies that doesn't force itself to stray into ""dirty"" humor just for an easy laugh. Instead, it's more heartfelt and I think that's why I enjoyed it as much as I did. It's charming and fun without being aimed at children and I think it'd be nice to see more comedies like this. If this film was on your radar but you missed it in theaters then I would say watch it. It's a fun comedy that doesn't overstay its welcome and it's entertaining from start to finish.",4,8/10 - Good,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,4219,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Out', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'week', 'think', 'one', 'expected', 'like', 'least', 'contrary', 'found', 'Guilt', 'Trip', 'be', 'really', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'More', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'be', 'film', 'strongest', 'attributes', 'are', 'charm', 'relatability', 'Everyone', 'what', 'have', 'mother', 'film', 'lot', 'mother/son', 'relationship', 'obviously', 'Now', 'love', 'mother', 'death', 'just', 'something', 'moms', 'where', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'tell', ""'re"", 'being', 'overbearing', 'snap', 'think', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'focusing', 'concept', 'Rogen/Streisand', 'duo', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'relationship', 'life.The', 'premise', 'simple', 'really', 'follow', 'Andy', 'Brewster', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'struggling', 'inventor', 'new', 'organic', 'cleaning', 'product', 'go', 'country', 'try', 'sell', 'product', 'big', 'companies', 'hopes', 'will', 'be', 'willing', 'distribute', 'large', 'quantities', 'Once', 'secret', 'mother', 'Joyce', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'come', 'long', 'only', 'thing', 'business', 'good', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'otherwise', ""n't"", 'want', 'worrying', 'spend', 'remaining', '60-70', 'minutes', 'following', 'two', 'week-long', 'road', 'whole', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'was', 'charming', 'full', 'laughs', 'doing', 'research', 'found', 'out', 'Streisand', 'was', 'nominated', 'Worst', 'Actress', 'film', '1', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'thing', '2', 'think', 'bit', 'overstatement', 'Streisand', 'way', 'Academy', 'Award', 'material', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'deny', 'Rogen', 'have', 'fantastic', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'movie', 'need', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'emulate', 'mother/son', 'relationship', 'two', 'did', 'perfectly.This', 'what', 'ultimately', 'what', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'can', 'relate', 'what', 'going', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'been', 'form', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'road', 'trip', 'conversations', 'arguments', 'are', 'had', 'movie', 'are', 'same', 'ones', 'had', 'other', 'mother/child', 'relationships', 'daily', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'ones', 'where', 'dynamic', 'shown', 'full', 'force', 'example', 'road', 'trip', 'go', 'buildings', 'when', 'meetings', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'rummaging', 'purse', 'making', 'bunch', 'noise', 'playing', 'loud', 'games', 'phone', 'wishing', 'good', 'luck', 'walking', 'away', 'think', 'one', 'things', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'get', ""'re"", 'always', 'going', 'feel', 'slightly', 'embarrassed', 'mother.The', 'casting', 'relatively', 'small', 'here', 'focus', 'mainly', 'Rogen', 'Streisand', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'huge', 'group', 'familiar', 'Most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'matter', 'minutes', 'However', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'play', 'pretty', 'major', 'role', 'story', 'giving', 'away', 'roles', 'have', 'Brett', 'Cullen', 'playing', 'Ben', 'Graw', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'playing', 'Andrew', 'Margolis', 'Jr', 'Still', 'even', 'two', 'are', 'only', 'here', 'maybe', 'three', 'minutes', 'Rogen', 'Streisand', 'are', 'main', 'focus', 'performances', 'could', 'make', 'break', 'film', 'Luckily', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'Rogen', 'back', 'semi-serious', 'role', 'think', ""'m"", 'starting', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'side', 'Streisand', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'was', ""n't"", 'exceptional', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'matters.Overall', 'Score', '8/10', 'Depending', 'who', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'Guilt', 'Trip', 'one', 'rare', 'comedies', ""n't"", 'force', 'stray', 'dirty', 'humor', 'just', 'easy', 'laugh', 'Instead', 'more', 'heartfelt', 'think', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'charming', 'fun', 'being', 'aimed', 'children', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'comedies', 'film', 'was', 'radar', 'missed', 'theaters', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'watch', 'fun', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'overstay', 'welcome', 'entertaining', 'start', 'finish']",N/A

1547862,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0087ITBPC,Ed Uyeshima,"[100, 114]","Aside from her near-cameo appearances in two ensemble comedies, Barbra Streisand has not starred in a movie in sixteen long years, not since 1996'sThe Mirror Has Two Faceswhich she also directed. Her output as an actress has been meager since around 1980 when she started directing films, building houses and returning to the concert stage periodically, so it was with both great anticipation and some trepidation that I saw this light-hearted 2012 comedy. What a relief to find she hasn't missed a beat in her sharp comedy timing. I think she's terrific as Joyce Brewster, the energetically overbearing mother of Andy, an organic chemical engineer who long ago moved to California and has recently invented a cleaning solution he is pitching to various store chains headquartered across the country. He plans a weekend visit with Joyce in New Jersey, but upon an intriguing discovery about her past, he invites her on an eight-day cross-country road trip with him.As directed by Anne Fletcher (The Proposal) and written by Dan Fogelman (the underratedCrazy, Stupid, Love) who based his script on his own late mother, the film is about how their two mismatched personalities unsurprisingly clash at every stop as their relationship twists and turns with each new humiliation for Andy and each new revelation for the both of them, a few of them quite poignant. The film is at its comedic best when she and co-star Seth Rogen as Andy volley back and forth with her well-meaning thoughts and antics at odds with his spiky annoyance at anything she says or does. Rogen plays against type as the coiled-up Andy since his stoner-dude personality has been the basis of much of his previous comedy. Here he needs to show some dramatic gravity (as he did earlier this year inTake This Waltz) and again does surprisingly well when necessary. There is a confrontation scene between the two characters that I wish could have gone on a bit longer and deeper than it did, but he manages to bring a real edge to the film in ways I didn't quite expect from him.Of course there are predictable comedy pieces that also work like a steak-eating contest in Texas where Joyce has to down a fifty-ounce piece of beef in an hour to avoid a $100 tab. There's also quite a supporting cast here, but like Streisand movies of yore, the familiar actors contribute moments that amount to nearly bit parts. Kathy Najimy and Miriam Margolyes are among Joyce's Weight Watchers friends in a quick dinner scene early in the story, while Adam Scott and Ari Graynor show up at the very end of the road trip in San Francisco. In between are appearances by Brett Cullen as a cowboy who becomes smitten with Joyce during the eating contest and Nora Dunn as an officious HSN TV hostess. But that's fine since Rogen really lets Streisand dominate the movie all the way from pushing off potential suitors at a mature singles mixer to getting into the wrong car at a mini-mart pit-stop to getting drunk in a motel bar to sharing her innocently ignorant perceptions of stereotypes. This is only her 19th film since her extraordinary debut inFunny Girl44 years ago, reason enough to enjoy the warm, accomplished performance she gives here.",4,Streisand and Rogen Bring Considerable Comedy Chops to a Lightweight Road Trip Movie,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,3194,"['Aside', 'near-cameo', 'appearances', 'two', 'ensemble', 'comedies', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'not', 'starred', 'movie', 'sixteen', 'long', 'years', 'not', ""1996'sThe"", 'Mirror', 'Has', 'Two', 'Faceswhich', 'also', 'directed', 'output', 'actress', 'been', 'meager', '1980', 'when', 'started', 'directing', 'films', 'building', 'houses', 'returning', 'concert', 'stage', 'periodically', 'was', 'great', 'anticipation', 'trepidation', 'saw', 'light-hearted', '2012', 'comedy', 'What', 'relief', 'find', ""n't"", 'missed', 'beat', 'sharp', 'comedy', 'timing', 'think', 'terrific', 'Joyce', 'Brewster', 'energetically', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'Andy', 'organic', 'chemical', 'engineer', 'who', 'long', 'ago', 'moved', 'California', 'recently', 'invented', 'cleaning', 'solution', 'pitching', 'various', 'store', 'chains', 'headquartered', 'country', 'weekend', 'visit', 'Joyce', 'New', 'Jersey', 'intriguing', 'discovery', 'past', 'eight-day', 'cross-country', 'road', 'trip', 'him.As', 'directed', 'Anne', 'Fletcher', 'Proposal', 'written', 'Dan', 'Fogelman', 'underratedCrazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'who', 'based', 'script', 'own', 'late', 'mother', 'film', 'how', 'two', 'mismatched', 'personalities', 'unsurprisingly', 'clash', 'stop', 'relationship', 'twists', 'turns', 'new', 'humiliation', 'Andy', 'new', 'revelation', 'few', 'quite', 'poignant', 'film', 'comedic', 'best', 'when', 'co-star', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Andy', 'volley', 'back', 'forth', 'well-meaning', 'thoughts', 'antics', 'odds', 'spiky', 'annoyance', 'anything', 'Rogen', 'plays', 'type', 'coiled-up', 'Andy', 'stoner-dude', 'personality', 'been', 'basis', 'much', 'previous', 'comedy', 'Here', 'show', 'dramatic', 'gravity', 'did', 'earlier', 'year', 'inTake', 'Waltz', 'again', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'when', 'necessary', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'two', 'characters', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'bit', 'longer', 'deeper', 'did', 'bring', 'real', 'edge', 'film', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'expect', 'him.Of', 'course', 'are', 'predictable', 'comedy', 'pieces', 'also', 'work', 'steak-eating', 'contest', 'Texas', 'where', 'Joyce', 'down', 'fifty-ounce', 'piece', 'beef', 'hour', 'avoid', '100', 'tab', 'also', 'quite', 'supporting', 'cast', 'here', 'Streisand', 'movies', 'yore', 'familiar', 'actors', 'contribute', 'moments', 'amount', 'nearly', 'bit', 'parts', 'Kathy', 'Najimy', 'Miriam', 'Margolyes', 'are', 'Joyce', 'Weight', 'Watchers', 'quick', 'dinner', 'scene', 'early', 'story', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'Ari', 'Graynor', 'show', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'road', 'trip', 'San', 'Francisco', 'are', 'appearances', 'Brett', 'Cullen', 'cowboy', 'who', 'smitten', 'Joyce', 'eating', 'contest', 'Nora', 'Dunn', 'officious', 'HSN', 'TV', 'hostess', 'fine', 'Rogen', 'really', 'Streisand', 'dominate', 'movie', 'way', 'pushing', 'off', 'potential', 'suitors', 'mature', 'mixer', 'getting', 'wrong', 'car', 'mini-mart', 'pit-stop', 'getting', 'drunk', 'motel', 'bar', 'sharing', 'innocently', 'ignorant', 'perceptions', 'stereotypes', 'only', '19th', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'debut', 'inFunny', 'Girl44', 'years', 'ago', 'reason', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'warm', 'accomplished', 'performance', 'here']",N/A

My mother is also on a fixed income, and she uses coupons, and she calls to see how I am if I have not called her in a while).

Brooks-like similarities in writing, is surprisingly one of the best and most earnest comedies/dramas seen in a while.In the modern tale of a mother-son relationship, Seth Rogen and Barbara Streisand go on a journey all the way through New Jersey to California in a Chevrolet Aveo as a means to satisfy Rogen character's promotional escapades to sell an organic liquid cleanser and to develop a stronger bond. What makes the film stand out is much of the film's treatment of the subject matter with moments involving them dealing with the usual quarrels and quibs that a loving mother would feel for his son (talking about their love lives, parenting, or recommending that he would drink water or lessen his alcohol intake).It is equally at parts heartfelt where we see notable but never overtly sentimental moments of Andy and Joyce, the two characters' names, dealing with their lives, sense of isolation from friends, loved ones, and past acquaintances. It is quirky and follows a Hollywood model in my places with the occasional PG-13 sex jokes and stereotypes but the film does not take the usual comedy route these days where ""that and that only"" is the prime focus (think other movies that Rogen's done before like Pineapple Express).Nothing stellar in terms of a social message, cinematography, or design but the acting and storyline all stand out to create a believable story that many can relate to and watch, laugh, and probably cry. For all reasons unknown, it might have been the Marty, the 1950s Ernest Borgnine film about an unmarried New York butcher, of December 2012.""",5,"Forget the critics!
