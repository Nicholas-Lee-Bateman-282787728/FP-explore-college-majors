75216,A1N10ZN3IQUA6E,078401132X,"Allen Berry ""Emerald Archer""","[0, 0]","Long ago in a far away land, long before the coming of the Marvel Epic, there was a rough and ready merc who appeared often as a guest character in Spider-Man and other books who got a film.  The folks who read the book knew him right off the bat! The Punisher was coming to the big screen!  They got a Hollywood Tough Guy, best known for his role ad Drago from the Rocky Movies, and put him in the roll of the gritty, take no prisoners merc. All told the body count was 91 people. The movie was gritty, dark, noir-esque.People, by and large, stayed away from the movie. He wasn't a loveable character like TV's Spider-Man, or Wonder Woman, not shiny/squeaky clean like Superman.  He was a take no prisoners, deliver no one liners kinda guy. The thing that made him an outcast in the Marvel Universe and a HIT with it's readers made the viewing public uncomfortable. Much the same way those who came after him were (see also &#34;The Punisher&#34; starring Thomas Jane and &#34;Punisher War Journal&#34; with Ray Stevenson).  This is not a superhero movie for kids. In fact, in this case, superhero is a bit of a misnomer, as The Punisher is just a really dedicated angry man, a Vietnam Vet fighting a war on crime to avenge his family... but he knows what most who seek to get revenge don't: That once you've made revenge your life's work and achieved revenge against those who wronged you (in this case killed your family), you are left with nothing but emptiness. The Punisher understands this, so he continues. Revenge is replaced by the mission, and the object of the mission is to wipe out crime so that no one else will suffer the fate of his family. Latter portrayals have cast the Punisher as a more and less fleshed out personality, Jane's was by far the most likeable of the actors who have taken on the role, Stevenson was by far the most taciturn in his portrayal, like an entity or spirit of revenge.  Dolph Lundgren's performance strikes the balance between the two, portraying the anti-hero as both strong and at odd moments spiritual. Perhaps the greatest complaint was the absence of the trademark Skull Logo on The Punisher's chest. Less egregious, the absence of the Marvel convention of &#34;mercy bullets&#34; as referenced in a Marvel Team Up with the Punisher and Spider Man.The fact is, The Punisher will probably never gain the wide following of the rock stars of the Marvel Universe such as Thor, Captain America, and the Avengers. The bright shining lights of the Marvelverse cast a wide shadow, and that is where The Punisher resides. With the obsession of his DC counterpart, Batman, but without the fancy toys, The Punisher will forever occupy the dark and gritty alleyways while Iron Man soars high above, and that's all right. There is as much room in the spectrum for Film Noir as there is for the Musical.The first Punisher film is not the glitzy joyful romp of the recent spate of Marvel Studios films, but neither is it the abomination of the Sci Fi Channel's &#34;Nick Fury,&#34; the rather goofy &#34;Fantastic Four&#34; films, or the earnest but over pronounced Daredevil.  This isn't one you'll want to watch with the kids, but the teens might appreciate it. If you're a fan of the comic film canon, this film is a MUST have to add to your collection.",5,"Maybe not Marvel Studios, but still a great production.",1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,3292,"['Long', 'ago', 'far', 'away', 'land', 'long', 'coming', 'Marvel', 'Epic', 'was', 'rough', 'ready', 'merc', 'who', 'appeared', 'often', 'guest', 'character', 'Spider-Man', 'other', 'books', 'who', 'got', 'film', 'folks', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'knew', 'right', 'bat', 'Punisher', 'was', 'coming', 'big', 'screen', 'got', 'Hollywood', 'Tough', 'Guy', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'ad', 'Drago', 'Rocky', 'Movies', 'put', 'roll', 'gritty', 'take', 'prisoners', 'merc', 'told', 'body', 'count', 'was', '91', 'people', 'movie', 'was', 'gritty', 'dark', 'noir-esque.People', 'large', 'stayed', 'away', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'loveable', 'character', 'TV', 'Spider-Man', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'not', 'shiny/squeaky', 'clean', 'Superman', 'was', 'take', 'prisoners', 'deliver', 'one', 'guy', 'thing', 'made', 'outcast', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'HIT', 'readers', 'made', 'viewing', 'public', 'uncomfortable', 'same', 'way', 'who', 'came', 'were', 'see', 'also', '34', 'Punisher', '34', 'starring', 'Thomas', 'Jane', '34', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Journal', '34', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'not', 'superhero', 'movie', 'kids', 'fact', 'case', 'superhero', 'bit', 'misnomer', 'Punisher', 'just', 'really', 'dedicated', 'angry', 'man', 'Vietnam', 'Vet', 'fighting', 'war', 'crime', 'avenge', 'family', 'what', 'most', 'who', 'seek', 'get', 'revenge', 'do', ""n't"", 'once', ""'ve"", 'made', 'revenge', 'life', 'work', 'achieved', 'revenge', 'who', 'wronged', 'case', 'killed', 'family', 'are', 'left', 'nothing', 'emptiness', 'Punisher', 'Revenge', 'replaced', 'mission', 'object', 'mission', 'wipe', 'out', 'crime', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'suffer', 'fate', 'family', 'Latter', 'portrayals', 'have', 'cast', 'Punisher', 'more', 'less', 'fleshed', 'out', 'personality', 'Jane', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'likeable', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'role', 'Stevenson', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'taciturn', 'portrayal', 'entity', 'spirit', 'revenge', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'performance', 'balance', 'two', 'portraying', 'anti-hero', 'strong', 'odd', 'moments', 'spiritual', 'Perhaps', 'greatest', 'complaint', 'was', 'absence', 'trademark', 'Skull', 'Logo', 'Punisher', 'chest', 'Less', 'egregious', 'absence', 'Marvel', 'convention', '34', 'mercy', 'bullets', '34', 'referenced', 'Marvel', 'Team', 'Up', 'Punisher', 'Spider', 'Man.The', 'fact', 'Punisher', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'gain', 'wide', 'following', 'rock', 'stars', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'such', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'Avengers', 'bright', 'shining', 'lights', 'Marvelverse', 'cast', 'wide', 'shadow', 'where', 'Punisher', 'resides', 'obsession', 'DC', 'counterpart', 'Batman', 'fancy', 'toys', 'Punisher', 'will', 'forever', 'dark', 'gritty', 'alleyways', 'Iron', 'Man', 'high', 'right', 'as', 'much', 'room', 'spectrum', 'Film', 'Noir', 'Musical.The', 'first', 'Punisher', 'film', 'not', 'glitzy', 'joyful', 'romp', 'recent', 'spate', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'films', 'abomination', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', '34', 'Nick', 'Fury', '34', 'rather', 'goofy', '34', 'Fantastic', 'Four', '34', 'films', 'earnest', 'pronounced', 'Daredevil', ""n't"", 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'kids', 'teens', 'might', 'appreciate', ""'re"", 'fan', 'comic', 'film', 'canon', 'film', 'MUST', 'have', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

Which is about all you can say - Dolph Lundgren is even more wooden than usual, having been saved from Death by Louis Gosset, who I can only assume was flat broke, to have even wanted to be associated with this garbage. It's bad, I mean real bad - the plot is all over the place, with virtually no references to the comic book story. Scenes begin with no explanation whatsoever, and usually end in an enormous explosion.  The Punisher has a weakness it seems, (aside from inability to act) and gets badly bloodied and beaten in a fist fight. But this is only a minor setback, as when faced with an army of machine gun toting goons he of course emerges completely unscathed. This is a cheap action flick of the type that were turned out by the 80's macho grist mill almost every week it seemed, and although some were good - this is one you'll want to forget in a hurry. Everything about it is says cheap and poorly finished, from characters to set design, and as for hiding out by riding around the sewers on a Harley that's loud enough to wake the dead - gimme a break! Average by Lundgrens standards, which is of course, not much of a recommendation - give this one a miss and catch the new one instead - you'll be glad you did.",1,Leather Clad Sewer Rat with a Harley,1094688000,"09 9, 2004",2004,1418,"['Having', 'just', 'bought', 'reviewed', 'most', 'recent', 'unquestionably', 'better', 'version', 'Marvel', 'character', 'adaptation', 'thought', ""'d"", 'revisit', '80', 'action', 'yarn', 'say', 'few', 'words', 'Which', 'can', 'say', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'even', 'more', 'wooden', 'usual', 'having', 'been', 'saved', 'Death', 'Louis', 'Gosset', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'was', 'flat', 'broke', 'have', 'even', 'wanted', 'be', 'associated', 'garbage', 'bad', 'mean', 'real', 'bad', 'plot', 'place', 'virtually', 'references', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'Scenes', 'begin', 'explanation', 'whatsoever', 'usually', 'end', 'enormous', 'explosion', 'Punisher', 'weakness', 'aside', 'inability', 'act', 'badly', 'bloodied', 'beaten', 'fist', 'fight', 'only', 'minor', 'setback', 'when', 'faced', 'army', 'machine', 'gun', 'toting', 'goons', 'course', 'emerges', 'completely', 'unscathed', 'cheap', 'action', 'flick', 'type', 'were', 'turned', 'out', '80', 'macho', 'grist', 'mill', 'almost', 'week', 'seemed', 'were', 'good', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'forget', 'hurry', 'Everything', 'cheap', 'poorly', 'finished', 'characters', 'set', 'design', 'hiding', 'out', 'riding', 'sewers', 'Harley', 'loud', 'enough', 'wake', 'dead', 'gim', 'break', 'Average', 'Lundgrens', 'standards', 'course', 'not', 'much', 'recommendation', 'give', 'one', 'miss', 'catch', 'new', 'one', 'instead', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",N/A

I had originally seen this movie several years prior on VHS but it was a shoddy copy. This time around it was presented in a better format.The original story goes that the Punisher (aka Frank Castle) is a death-dealing vigilante who extracts more than enough vengeance for the murders of his family (wife, son and daughter) by the mob. Frank survives the hit, goes underground and reemerges as the Punisher.This movie was a decent rendition of the Punisher story but, like a lot of other movies, did not hold up to the original storyline. Here, Frank sees his family get blown up in the family car that is at the family home as opposed to a mob hit in Central Park. Also, The Punisher is widely known as wearing dark colored shirts with a white skeletal image on it. In the movie, the only times you see the skeletal image is on his knives, which he uses quite effectively.Overall, the movie plot was not too bad but could have been better written. Dolph Lundgren does a fair job as Frank although his dialogues seemed quite dumb. His physique was the one thing of Dolph that I believe fit well for the character of Frank Castle. The scenes were also pretty well done but seemed a bit choppy at times.For anyone who is a fan of the Punisher, I do recommend the movie but the new 2004 one with Thomas Jane is a better one although they do still change the storyline in that one too.",3,Could have been better.,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,1469,"['comic', 'book', 'fan', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'anticipated', 'release', 'movie', 'DVD', 'had', 'originally', 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'years', 'prior', 'VHS', 'was', 'shoddy', 'copy', 'time', 'was', 'presented', 'better', 'format.The', 'original', 'story', 'Punisher', 'aka', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'death-dealing', 'vigilante', 'who', 'more', 'enough', 'vengeance', 'murders', 'family', 'wife', 'son', 'daughter', 'mob', 'Frank', 'hit', 'underground', 'reemerges', 'Punisher.This', 'movie', 'was', 'decent', 'rendition', 'Punisher', 'story', 'lot', 'other', 'movies', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'original', 'storyline', 'Here', 'Frank', 'family', 'get', 'blown', 'up', 'family', 'car', 'family', 'home', 'opposed', 'mob', 'hit', 'Central', 'Park', 'Also', 'Punisher', 'widely', 'known', 'wearing', 'dark', 'colored', 'shirts', 'white', 'skeletal', 'image', 'movie', 'only', 'times', 'see', 'skeletal', 'image', 'knives', 'quite', 'effectively.Overall', 'movie', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'written', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'fair', 'job', 'Frank', 'dialogues', 'seemed', 'quite', 'dumb', 'physique', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'Dolph', 'believe', 'fit', 'well', 'character', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'seemed', 'bit', 'choppy', 'times.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Punisher', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'new', '2004', 'one', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'better', 'one', 'do', 'still', 'change', 'storyline', 'one', 'too']",N/A

It is such a good children&#65533;s movie thing I think Disney should buy the rights of this movie and make a sequel. Not!Let me restart this recommendation. Children beware, whenever you see this movie for sale you are in the wrong part of the store. I say this for one reason and that is&#65533; it is the most violent movie out there. It&#65533;s got everything blood, nudity, bad language, action not suitable for kids, and a lot of killing. But that doesn&#65533;t mean that it isn't the most perfect action movie ever made, it is the perfect action movie ever made. I was shocked when I found this DVD in the 5-dollar DVD pile at Wall Mart. I have to admit I wasn&#65533;t going to get it until I noticed the words &#65533;based on characters from MARVEL comics&#65533; and chaching Wall Mart had made another 5 bucks. This movie is awesome, this &#65533;Punisher&#65533; guy is an ex MARINE and COP who fell into the line of revenge. His motto is &#65533;If your guilty your dead&#65533;! And he means only that.

think they are equally as GoodDolph Lundgren's version has different storyline to the Tom Jane versionwhich is interesting, Dolph Lundgren's version involves the Japanese mafiataking over the American

violence but lacks storyline and plotThere is also a Workprint version of Dolph Lundgren's versionwhich has only been released officially by German DVD Distributor Starlightfilm/XT Videoreleased in 2005 to promote the Tom Jane remakein my opinion this workprint version is much much better than the Theatrical versionit's an extended cut version with about 8mins of extra scenes runtime about 95minsthis extended cut tells the story more thoroughly about Frank castle's family and their Deathby one of the Mafia family'sthe extra scenes also extend Lundgren's performance as the Punisher and how Frank castle became the Punisherwhen the Theatrical version does not have the backstorybrilliant performance by Dolph Lundren who Portrays the Punisher as a Psychotic cop hell bent on killing criminalsDolph Lundgren plays the Punisher broken down and burnt out on a murderous rampage that couldn't care about the Justice systemvery sad and tragic actuallyKim Miyori who plays Lady Tanaka

Adapted from a Marvel Comic Book, the movie stars Dolph Lundgren as Frank Castle, an embittered ex-cop that is killing off criminals in revenge for the murder of his own family.  Louis Gossett Jr is Castle's former partner, who wants to capture the vigilante more for personal reasons than those of justice.  The story is both ironic and simplistic.  The Punisher has so weakened the grip of the crime families, that it allows a new, far more sadistic threat to come in a take over.  When the new crime organization kidnaps the old crime families children for the slave labor market, The Punisher must join forces with his hated enemies to help destroy an evil he actually helped to create.  The movie contains enough bone crunching action to keep it from being boring, but just because Mark Goldblatt was an excellent editor of action movies did not make him a good director of those movies - he frames just about everything in medium shot.  Lundgren says very little and looks more sleepy than burned out.

75228,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,078401132X,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[37, 39]","Let's face it, before Blade (1998), X-Men (2000) and Spider-Man (2002), Marvel Comics really didn't have much luck in getting successful films made based on their characters.  The reason?  Because they would often sell the movie rights to anyone who had two coins to rub together, releasing cinematic flops like Dr. Strange (1978), Howard the Duck (1986), Captain America (1989), and even a Fantastic Four movie that was so bad it never saw the light of day, as it was too bad to even release on video.  And then there was The Punisher (1989), a character introduced in the 70's within the pages of The Amazing Spider-Man, issue 129, circa February 1974, a former police detective, now vigilante, taking revenge on criminals, motivated by the death of his family.  Most people I know who've seen the film have pretty distinctive feelings about it, ranging from dislike to severe hate, but I always thought it was pretty good, considering...The film, directed by Mark Goldblatt, whose primary credits include editing films like The Howling (1981), The Terminator (1984), and True Lies (1994), stars Dolph Lundgren, Louis Gossett, Jr., and Jerome Krabb&eacute;.  Yeah, I know what you're thinking...Dolph Lundgren?  I think a number of people had instant reservations when hearing Dolph, certainly an interminable dweller of the B movie circuit, pre-judging the film unfairly.  Lou Gossett, Jr. brings a little star power to the table, but he also is no stranger to B movie fans appearing in films like Jaws 3-D (1983), Firewalker (1986), and any of the four or so Iron Eagle films.The film opens with a television news report, giving us some expository background with regards to a mafia type recently acquitted of the crime of killing detective Frank Castle (Lungren) and his family five years prior.  The report also speaks of an elusive character named the Punisher, who has been busy killing members of the mafia over the last five years, racking up an impressive body count.  Any connection?  Probably...anyway, the mafia guy, returns home to celebrate, and guess who crashes the party?  Killing and explosions ensue.  Enter Detective Jake Berkowitz (Gossett).  Seems Detective Berkowitz has been leading the investigation of the Punisher for the last five years, and believes the Punisher is actually Frank Castle, despite his superior's beliefs that Castle is dead, as the thought of a rogue cop going around killing people would be unpopular.  With the recent death of this mafia boss, there's a void of real leadership in the organization, one filled with the return of Gianni Franco (Krabb&eacute;) from Europe, who intends to unite the remains of the various mob families whose ranks have been severely depleted by you know who...Turns out the decimation of the mafia families hasn't gone unnoticed, as the Yakuza (Japanese mafia) has decided to move in and take a controlling interest in criminal activities within the city, a hostile takeover, to say the least.  Sounds pretty to the Punisher, as if the criminals are killing themselves off, less work for him...until the Yakuza kidnaps children of the remaining mafia families in an effort to extort control and pressure them under the Yakuza's thumb.  So Castle, feeling somewhat responsible as his five-year vendetta has left the families unable to protect even their own children, begins dealing with the Yakuza, which eventually leads to an unlikely alliance with Franco, who's son is one of the kidnapped children.Guns, knives, throwing stars, explosions, it's all here (well, as far as the explosions, at one point the Punisher is firing a grenade launcher, and the explosions seem less than spectacular, more flashy than boom boomy).  Not only that but there's a good amount of karate.  Lundgren, a former karate champion himself, performs most all of his own stunts, and there is almost no choreography within the marital arts scenes, as real artists were used, and training in stunt techniques.  Does the film stay true to the original character portrayed in the comics?  For the most part...some minor changes, along with a few major ones (he never dons a shirt emblazoned with a white skull on it).  I think one of the main reasons this film was ill received is because comic fans are a particular picky lot, as they spend a lot of time getting to know these characters, and tend to have high expectations when someone adapts one of their favorite characters to the silver screen.  I read comics from the age of 9 until I was 23, so I have intimate knowledge, or at least I did, of many characters, and I thought this particular rendition of this character retained most of the important elements.  The main element I didn't care for was his living in the sewers.  I brought to mind teenage mutant ninja turtles, which is an altogether different film.  I did think Lundgren face makeup was overdone.  I understand why it was done the way it was, to present the visage of a skull when the light hit his face just right, and it succeeded, but other times he sort of looked like a drag queen.  The most painful element of the film was the dialog.  I rolled my eyes more than a few times as the delineation between Frank Castle and the Punisher was examined, unsuccessfully.  Some of it was extremely corny, more so combined with Lundgren's deadpan delivery.  The direction was pretty good in most areas, given that this was Goldblatt's second film, his first being the Joe Piscopo/Treat Williams cop flick Dead Heat (1988).  Goldblatt has since returned to editing, which seems a much better fit for him.  Gossett is fun to watch, but again, given the dialog, he is given some completely rotten lines, but he does seem to try to make the best of it, earning whatever he got for appearing in this film.A

Dolph Lundgren is a former cop, believed to have been murdered in a car bomb that ended his family's life, who exacts revenge on the crime syndicate that he believes is responsible. Louis Gossett, Jr. is a cop who believes that all of these murders are in fact being caused by his former partner. With the mafia bosses suffering such massive losses, the head of the Yakuza enters and violent assurts herself into the acquation, kidnapping the bosses' children and holding them for ransom. With nowhere else to turn, the bosses call on &quot;The Punisher&quot; for an unlikely alliance.&quot;Punisher&quot; is excessively violent. There are torture scenes, bloody shoot-outs, and more than a few people getting kicked in the face with blade-tipped shoes. The story, courtesy of Boaz Yakin, does have a sense of humor though. Most of the film's big laughs come from Barry Otto's drunken out-of-work theatre peformer who doubles as Lundgren's unwilling sidekick. Lundgren himself gets to drop a few funny one-liners as well while Louis Gossett and Jeroen Krabbe give performances that prove worthy of their resume. The relatively-unknown Kim Myori is also great as the super evil Yakuza boss.As far as full-length comic book movies go, this one is not quite on the level of Tim Burton's &quot;Batman&quot; or Sam Raimi's &quot;Spider Man&quot; but there have certainly been a lot worse.",3,THE PUNISHER Review!,1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,1544,"['Not', 'be', 'confused', '2004', 'remake', 'Mark', 'Goldblatt', 'dark', 'unapologeticly', 'violent', 'comic', 'book', 'adaption', '1989', 'onscreen', 'brutality', 'new', 'level', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'former', 'cop', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'car', 'bomb', 'ended', 'family', 'life', 'who', 'revenge', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'responsible', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'cop', 'who', 'murders', 'are', 'fact', 'being', 'caused', 'former', 'partner', 'mafia', 'suffering', 'such', 'massive', 'losses', 'head', 'Yakuza', 'enters', 'violent', 'assurts', 'acquation', 'kidnapping', 'bosses', 'children', 'holding', 'ransom', 'nowhere', 'else', 'turn', 'bosses', 'call', 'quot', 'Punisher', 'quot', 'unlikely', 'alliance.', 'quot', 'Punisher', 'quot', 'excessively', 'violent', 'are', 'torture', 'scenes', 'bloody', 'shoot-outs', 'more', 'few', 'people', 'getting', 'kicked', 'face', 'blade-tipped', 'shoes', 'story', 'courtesy', 'Boaz', 'Yakin', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'Most', 'film', 'big', 'laughs', 'come', 'Barry', 'Otto', 'drunken', 'out-of-work', 'theatre', 'peformer', 'who', 'Lundgren', 'unwilling', 'sidekick', 'Lundgren', 'drop', 'few', 'funny', 'one-liners', 'well', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'give', 'performances', 'prove', 'worthy', 'resume', 'relatively-unknown', 'Kim', 'Myori', 'also', 'great', 'super', 'evil', 'Yakuza', 'boss.As', 'far', 'full-length', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'go', 'one', 'not', 'quite', 'level', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'quot', 'Batman', 'quot', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'quot', 'Spider', 'Man', 'quot', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'lot', 'worse']",N/A

However, this films saving grace is the action and all the brutality you would expect in a Punisher film, the dialogue by Dolph Lundgren is awful why they choose him to play the clearly Italian Frank Castle is beyond me but they should have dubbed his voice or something because it was pretty bad but then again almost all of the films dialogue should have been dubbed over, this film isn't written half as good as the comic book incarnation. Never the less, as I touched on before this film has great action and somewhat of an entertaining story, if you think about the comics the entire way through it, but then again that could make some people angry...As for the DVD,I'm surprised this was even transfered to DVD being as it was such a failure I figured the production company would be trying anything to make it dissapear. The DVD is bare bones, offering a trailer and some cast & crew stuff. All in all I bought this DVD cause I loved the action and the resulting stigma of the character portrayed therein.

75241,A3OHB78Y7L7ZK,078401132X,GSD,"[0, 0]","The Punisher (1989) is a film that, like a lot of other early Marvel films of the late 80's and early 90's, is low budget, however, unlike those, this one is actually pretty good. It gets a bad rap because it is low budget and Dolph Lungren is often seen as a bad actor. But again, this is pretty good. It comes off as a brutal 70's cop film and if it wasn't called THE PUNISHER and if the name wasn't mentioned in the film several times, it would be just another Clint Eastwood/Charles Bronson-esque hardcore cop ripoff.Many people claim this is the best adaptation of The Punisher ever put to film. That may be true as Dolph Lungren's portrayal is a lot like the Punisher of the 80's comics, stoic, cold and unrelenting in his vengeance. Dolph plays the character with very little heart which is what The Punisher was in the 80's. Many people say that Dolph Lungren is a flat or wooden actor. If this is true, it works here. He doesn't say much and often appears with a glassy eyed, depressed gaze that makes you desperate to know what he is thinking. He is The Punisher of the 80's comics, the way that Christopher Reeve was the Superman of the 70's and 80's comics. One other thing that we get to see here that other Punisher movies don't offer is The Punisher's obsession with knives. He carries knives on him and his former partner, Jake, actually confiscated a knife (as well as several hundred round casings) from The Punisher's brutal war on crime.The film opens with a news report, giving expository background on mafia tough guy who was recently acquitted of the crime of killing detective Frank Castle and his family five years earlier. The report also speaks of an elusive character dubbed the Punisher, who has been killing members of the mafia over the last five years, racking up an impressive body count. So, the mafia guy, returns home to celebrate, with The Punisher crashing the party and killing a bunch of bad guys and blowing up their mansion. Enter Detective Jake Berkowitz (Louis Gossett Jr.) Detective Berkowitz has been leading the Punisher Task Force for the last five years, and believes the Punisher is actually Frank Castle, despite his superior's beliefs that Castle is dead, as the thought of a rogue cop going around killing people would be unpopular. With the recent death of this mafia boss, there's a void of real leadership in the organization, one filled with the return of Gianni Franco (Jeroen Krabb&eacute; who was a James Bond villain in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS) from Europe, who intends to unite the remains of the various mob families.The decimation of the mafia families hasn't gone unnoticed, as the Yakuza (Japanese mafia) has decided to move in and take a controlling interest in criminal activities within the city. To do this, the Yakuza kidnaps children of the remaining mafia families in an effort to extort control and pressure them under the Yakuza's thumb. So The Punisher, feeling somewhat responsible as his five-year vendetta has left the families unable to protect even their own children, begins dealing with the Yakuza, which eventually leads to an unlikely alliance with Franco, who's son is one of the kidnapped children. So, the Punisher, on a reluctant team-up with Gianni Franco, goes after the Yazuka. Once the children are safe and the majority of the Yazuka ""punished,"" The Punisher kills Franco in front of his son and tells his son, ""you are a good kid, let's hope you grow up to be a good man or I'll be waiting.""As a movie, this could have been a lot better. As a Punisher film, it works, although it certainly would have benefited from better writing and a bigger budget, however Gosset Jr. is convincing as a cop, Lungren certainly pulls of role of The Punisher very well and all other characters range from mediocre to great. 4 out of 5 stars.",4,The Best of the Early Marvel Films,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,3817,"['Punisher', '1989', 'film', 'lot', 'other', 'early', 'Marvel', 'films', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'low', 'budget', 'however', 'one', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'bad', 'rap', 'low', 'budget', 'Dolph', 'Lungren', 'often', 'seen', 'bad', 'actor', 'again', 'pretty', 'good', 'off', 'brutal', '70', 'cop', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'called', 'THE', 'PUNISHER', 'name', 'was', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'Clint', 'Eastwood/Charles', 'Bronson-esque', 'hardcore', 'cop', 'ripoff.Many', 'people', 'claim', 'best', 'adaptation', 'Punisher', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'Dolph', 'Lungren', 'portrayal', 'lot', 'Punisher', '80', 'comics', 'stoic', 'cold', 'unrelenting', 'vengeance', 'Dolph', 'character', 'very', 'little', 'heart', 'what', 'Punisher', 'was', '80', 'Many', 'people', 'say', 'Dolph', 'Lungren', 'flat', 'wooden', 'actor', 'true', 'here', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'often', 'glassy', 'eyed', 'depressed', 'gaze', 'desperate', 'know', 'what', 'thinking', 'Punisher', '80', 'comics', 'way', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'was', 'Superman', '70', '80', 'comics', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'get', 'see', 'here', 'other', 'Punisher', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'offer', 'Punisher', 'obsession', 'knives', 'knives', 'former', 'partner', 'Jake', 'actually', 'confiscated', 'knife', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'hundred', 'round', 'casings', 'Punisher', 'brutal', 'war', 'crime.The', 'film', 'news', 'report', 'giving', 'expository', 'background', 'mafia', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'recently', 'acquitted', 'crime', 'killing', 'detective', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'family', 'five', 'years', 'earlier', 'report', 'also', 'elusive', 'character', 'dubbed', 'Punisher', 'who', 'been', 'killing', 'members', 'mafia', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'racking', 'up', 'impressive', 'body', 'count', 'So', 'mafia', 'guy', 'home', 'celebrate', 'Punisher', 'crashing', 'party', 'killing', 'bunch', 'bad', 'guys', 'blowing', 'up', 'mansion', 'Enter', 'Detective', 'Jake', 'Berkowitz', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'Detective', 'Berkowitz', 'been', 'leading', 'Punisher', 'Task', 'Force', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'Punisher', 'actually', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'superior', 'beliefs', 'Castle', 'dead', 'thought', 'rogue', 'cop', 'going', 'killing', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'unpopular', 'recent', 'death', 'mafia', 'boss', 'void', 'real', 'leadership', 'organization', 'one', 'filled', 'return', 'Gianni', 'Franco', 'Jeroen', 'Krabb', 'eacute', 'who', 'was', 'James', 'Bond', 'villain', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DAYLIGHTS', 'Europe', 'who', 'unite', 'remains', 'various', 'mob', 'families.The', 'decimation', 'mafia', 'families', ""n't"", 'gone', 'unnoticed', 'Yakuza', 'Japanese', 'mafia', 'decided', 'move', 'take', 'controlling', 'interest', 'criminal', 'activities', 'city', 'do', 'Yakuza', 'children', 'remaining', 'mafia', 'families', 'effort', 'extort', 'control', 'pressure', 'Yakuza', 'thumb', 'Punisher', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'responsible', 'five-year', 'vendetta', 'left', 'families', 'unable', 'protect', 'even', 'own', 'children', 'dealing', 'Yakuza', 'eventually', 'unlikely', 'alliance', 'Franco', 'who', 'son', 'one', 'kidnapped', 'children', 'So', 'Punisher', 'reluctant', 'team-up', 'Gianni', 'Franco', 'Yazuka', 'children', 'are', 'safe', 'majority', 'Yazuka', 'punished', 'Punisher', 'kills', 'Franco', 'front', 'son', 'son', 'are', 'good', 'kid', 'let', 'hope', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'good', 'man', ""'ll"", 'be', 'waiting', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'Punisher', 'film', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'better', 'writing', 'bigger', 'budget', 'however', 'Gosset', 'Jr.', 'convincing', 'cop', 'Lungren', 'certainly', 'role', 'Punisher', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'characters', 'range', 'mediocre', 'great', '4', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Now it seems THE PUNISHER is to hit theaters in 2004 starring the 'shark wrangler' from DEEP BLUE SEA as the executor of all things mob.  Why?  The DOLPH LUNDGREN powered Austrailian made version of the same Marvel comic is good enough.  That's right, good enough.  Sure, my man Dolph delivers lines like &quot;The guilty must be punished&quot; like he's chomping on his kickboxing mouthguard, but he still kicks ass.  The body count in this flick is what you'd expect if you have read the ultra-violent comic, and the action is well staged and fast moving.  Loses some polish for okay acting, some cheesy momments, and a cop out two guys hugging with the gun that goes off &quot;who got shot?!?!&quot; showdown, but the filler is plush.  The badass mute karate chick is great and the way she's dispatched even better.  LADY TANAKA is way over the top, but fun to watch and it's nice to see a couple of main villians that are ruthless women.  Dolph is Dolph, but I can't help but not see him as THE PUNISHER in this film.  He does a good job bringing the ex-cop turned tough vigilante to light.  So, my point is; why remake it?  I'm a firm believer in 'if it ain't broke don't fix it'.  Hollywood has apparently run the idea mill to the nub if there are intended remakes of films such as this as well as a remake of SUPERMAN (what's wrong with the 1979 CHRISTOPHER REEVE version? Fx? I find the non-CG fx  endearing and the story was great and engaging).  The same applies here; decent story, fun mayhem, and LOU GOSSETT JR.  Remake CAPTAIN AMERICA instead, I'm sure it's unanymous that the 1989 version of that film was bad enough to warrant one, because THE PUNISHER is a decent DVD distraction and worth the ten bones.",4,"Dolph Castle, meet Frank Lundgren.",1068508800,"11 11, 2003",2003,2045,"['Due', 'influx', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'hysteria', 'initiated', 'release', 'lackluster', 'blockbuster', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'viewing', 'public', 'getting', 'bombarded', 'everything', 'super-hero', 'mostly', 'MARVEL', 'variety', 'craze', 'seen', 'ups', 'X-MEN', '1', 'amp', '2', 'HULK', 'BLADE', 'downs', 'DAREDEVIL', 'three', 'bad', 'movies', 'Now', 'THE', 'PUNISHER', 'hit', 'theaters', '2004', 'starring', ""'shark"", 'wrangler', 'DEEP', 'BLUE', 'SEA', 'executor', 'things', 'mob', 'Why', 'DOLPH', 'LUNDGREN', 'powered', 'Austrailian', 'made', 'version', 'same', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'good', 'enough', 'right', 'good', 'enough', 'Sure', 'man', 'Dolph', 'lines', 'quot', 'guilty', 'must', 'be', 'punished', 'quot', 'chomping', 'kickboxing', 'mouthguard', 'still', 'ass', 'body', 'count', 'flick', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'have', 'read', 'ultra-violent', 'comic', 'action', 'well', 'staged', 'fast', 'moving', 'polish', 'okay', 'acting', 'cheesy', 'momments', 'cop', 'out', 'two', 'guys', 'hugging', 'gun', 'quot', 'who', 'got', 'shot', 'quot', 'showdown', 'filler', 'plush', 'badass', 'mute', 'karate', 'chick', 'great', 'way', 'dispatched', 'even', 'better', 'LADY', 'TANAKA', 'way', 'top', 'fun', 'watch', 'nice', 'see', 'couple', 'main', 'villians', 'are', 'ruthless', 'women', 'Dolph', 'Dolph', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'not', 'see', 'THE', 'PUNISHER', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'ex-cop', 'turned', 'tough', 'vigilante', 'light', 'So', 'point', 'why', 'remake', ""'m"", 'firm', 'believer', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'Hollywood', 'apparently', 'run', 'idea', 'mill', 'nub', 'are', 'intended', 'remakes', 'films', 'such', 'as', 'well', 'remake', 'SUPERMAN', 'what', 'wrong', '1979', 'CHRISTOPHER', 'REEVE', 'version', 'Fx', 'find', 'non-CG', 'fx', 'endearing', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'engaging', 'same', 'applies', 'here', 'decent', 'story', 'fun', 'mayhem', 'LOU', 'GOSSETT', 'JR.', 'Remake', 'CAPTAIN', 'AMERICA', 'instead', ""'m"", 'sure', 'unanymous', '1989', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'warrant', 'one', 'THE', 'PUNISHER', 'decent', 'DVD', 'distraction', 'ten', 'bones']",N/A

Either way it's slightly depressing to watch. The plot concerns Frank Castle AKA The Punisher and his effort to rid Washington DC (actually Melbourne, Australia) of criminal scum. He's wiped out a million guys in a couple of years and the cops want to send him to prison. Frank Castle used to be a cop and since the Mob killed his family he's lived in the sewer. As you do...This film has been cut to shreds. I know there was more story and action filmed than what was actually shown in the film. It's criminally short but seems to go on for an eternity.The director is Mark Goldblatt. He edited ""Total Recall"", ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Hollow Man"". The action is quite dull and Dolph has no one-liners and no emotion. Dolph can usually be relied upon to deliver the goods but not here. I guess in 1989 he couldn't pick and choose his roles. This film followed the abysmal ""Red Scorpion"", his clout wasn't as such so he could so ""no"".Dolph has enjoyed some decent roles but in recent years he has been offered some really bad scripts. I think it's time he realized he should be getting back into A-List films. This is not his best.

75247,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,078401132X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 3]","This film covers one essential theme in the American action cinema : crime is high, justice is bad, so justice has to be taken by some people into their own hands. There are many variations on the theme. In this film, an ex-cop, who got his wife, children and whole family wiped out by a bomb in their car is assuming the fundamental mission of killing the guilty. This is the very same theme we find in many western films with Clint Eastwood. The other element in this film is the attempt by the Japanese maffia to take over the Los Angeles maffia. This contains a certain level of jingoism, but it is reduced to very little by the simple fact of making the Los Angeles maffia particularly nasty, simple-minded, egotistic and unrelenting. The Franco boss of that maffia, the only survivor, who tries to kill the Punisher after the latter has freed his son from the hands of the Japanese maffia is particularly gross. But there is no moral in such a film. There is no deep meaning, even if it is the reflection of what ordinary Americans think about crime in the USA. And that reaction leads them to wish for and accept punishers or politicians who promise to be punishers, and the death penalty, and also the idea that justice is after all their own mission, and they become some kind of vigilantes. This is part of American culture and will never be able to be really uprooted, without at least a complete change in culture. The only symbolical element is the fact that the Punisher is living in the sewers, under the big city. He is the underworld that punishes the other underworld. He is the language of the bowels of the people. He represents the deep instincts and needs, the basic layers of social conscience.

Let me explain why: Like Van Damme's Street Fighter, this film maintains some elements of the comic book story but not all of them. I feel it was a pretty good film because it was not your run of the mill superhero film. It is gritty urban violence, which was being craved by audiences more and more during the 90's. The most impressive element to the film are the Japanese villains and their leader, Lady Tanaka, beautifully portrayed by Kim Miyori. These characters embody everything villains should be in a film: cold, calculating, sadistic, brutal, nonverbal (to a certain extent), and I mean, the list goes on and on.

I have also now seen, what I believe to be, the only three movies made thus far on The Marvel Comics avenging angel Frank Castle, known as The Punisher.This one stars Dolph Lundgren as Frank Castle and Louis Gossett, Jr. as Castle's former police partner.  The story is the same theme as the other two Punisher movies I have seen,  as it shows flash backs of Frank's wife and child killed with a car bomb which blew up their car.  Frank Castle turns into &#34;The Punisher&#34; in his search to find and destroy the criminal mob.  However, this time it is not only the American mob but the Japanese Yakuza who are also involved in vicious criminal acts that the Punisher must deal with in his own special way.This film has very little dialogue but if you like your movies filled with action you will enjoy this DVD.  It has numerous shoot-outs with rifles and handguns, there is also  fist fighting, knife fighting, karate fighting action, Samurai sword attacks and counters, and numerous other interesting action scenes.The story centers around the Japanese Yakuza attempting to take over the rackets from the American mobsters.  When the American thugs refuse to cooperate, the Japanese Yakuza leader kidnaps the children of the Mob leaders. The Punisher saves all the children with the exception of the American Mob leader's son, but  the mob thug makes a temporary pack with Frank Castle to save his kidnapped son from the Yakuza.If you are a Punisher fan, you should check out this DVD.

And Lundgren rock at the title role!Another thing, shure the movie is low-budget and he dosen't have a skull shirt (look at his face, if you notice it makes a shape of a skull). So to end this review, see it, you don't have to own it or anything like that, just rent it-It's worth the money!",5,the guilty will be punished,1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,402,"['start', 'off', 'i', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'say', 'how', 'underated', 'i', 'think', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'Lundgren', 'rock', 'title', 'role', 'thing', 'shure', 'movie', 'low-budget', 'dose', ""n't"", 'have', 'skull', 'shirt', 'look', 'face', 'notice', 'shape', 'skull', 'So', 'end', 'review', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'own', 'anything', 'just', 'rent', 'it-It', 'worth', 'money']",N/A

Paul ""John doe""","[1, 2]","I know I can see the famnboys having there high speed come apart I like this movie more than the 2004 movie which I do like the 2004 Punisher & it's a lot better than that R rated Saturday morning cartoon Punisher Warzone. I think Dolph Lundgren was a d**n good Punisher I know they changed a lot from the comics you don't need to tell me about there is no skull on the shirt. I thought the biker clothes were cool as h**l. I mean like who cares about no skull symbol he's still a Punisher to me. Also Luis Gossett JR. plays Jake Berkowitz Nancy Everhard plays Samantha Jeronen Krabble as Gianni Franco & Kim Miyeri as Lady Tanaka. Your plot is Frank Castle The Punisher has been living in the sewers of Seattle for 5 years I really wish they would do it in New York but at least it actually looks like a city unlike Punisher Warzone. The Punisher is at war with the Mob & his ex partner Jake Berkowitz thinks Frank Castle is still alive he is working with a new partner Samantha Leary & they're looking for him. Meanwhile you have this Japaneese Mafia Group called the Yakaza which they are in some of the Punisher games too. This group lead by Lady Tanaka. Crime Boss Gianni Franco ain't going to budge for her so this b***h is so evil sadistic & her plans are evil. People today love ""realism"" for some reason & I think that this plot should be used more Lady Tanaka is going to have the Franco crime syndicate's children kidnapped & be put in human trafficing rings. The little boy Tommy was 1 brave mother f****r so of course Castle is going after the Yakaza & saves a lot of the kids then Franco has to borrow the Punisher to get his son back & if he doesn't he will kill Berkowitz. So in the Yakaza headquaters you have lot of shootouts & action out the a** this whole movie has wall to wall action Dolph Lundgren displaying his martial arts ability. The action is shot & edited well it isn't spliced up with some good ol' shakey cam. Great lines like when Berkowitz says ""What do you call a 125 murders in 5 years Punisher: ""A work in progress."" I love the ending I liked Dolph Lundgren's style & Luis Gossett JR was enjoyable I liked the Punisher with a Harley I thought it was bad a** & I think the 2004 movie owes a lot to this movie. There is a workprint that I've heard that has flashbacks between Frank Castle & Jake Berkowitz when they were partners before Frank's family was killed I've heard it's more violent if you know where I can get a copy of the Punisher 89 workprint comment me. I hope we get a special edition of the 89 Punisher & hopefully a extended version on BLU RAY. I thought the plot was good for 89 it was pretty  good. So this will probably be my favorite Punisher movie.",5,My favorite Punisher movie & that's the bottom line 9/10,1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,2705,"['know', 'can', 'see', 'famnboys', 'having', 'there', 'high', 'speed', 'come', 'apart', 'like', 'movie', 'more', '2004', 'movie', 'do', '2004', 'Punisher', 'lot', 'better', 'R', 'rated', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'Punisher', 'Warzone', 'think', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'was', 'd**n', 'good', 'Punisher', 'know', 'changed', 'lot', 'comics', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'skull', 'shirt', 'thought', 'biker', 'clothes', 'were', 'cool', 'h**l.', 'mean', 'who', 'skull', 'symbol', 'still', 'Punisher', 'Also', 'Luis', 'Gossett', 'JR.', 'plays', 'Jake', 'Berkowitz', 'Nancy', 'Everhard', 'Samantha', 'Jeronen', 'Krabble', 'Gianni', 'Franco', 'Kim', 'Miyeri', 'Lady', 'Tanaka', 'plot', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Punisher', 'been', 'living', 'sewers', 'Seattle', '5', 'years', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'do', 'New', 'York', 'least', 'actually', 'city', 'Punisher', 'Warzone', 'Punisher', 'war', 'Mob', 'ex', 'partner', 'Jake', 'Berkowitz', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'still', 'alive', 'working', 'new', 'partner', 'Samantha', 'Leary', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Meanwhile', 'have', 'Japaneese', 'Mafia', 'Group', 'called', 'Yakaza', 'are', 'Punisher', 'games', 'too', 'group', 'lead', 'Lady', 'Tanaka', 'Crime', 'Boss', 'Gianni', 'Franco', 'ai', ""n't"", 'going', 'budge', 'so', 'b***h', 'so', 'evil', 'sadistic', 'plans', 'are', 'evil', 'People', 'today', 'love', 'realism', 'reason', 'think', 'plot', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'more', 'Lady', 'Tanaka', 'going', 'have', 'Franco', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'children', 'kidnapped', 'be', 'put', 'human', 'trafficing', 'rings', 'little', 'boy', 'Tommy', 'was', '1', 'brave', 'mother', 'f****r', 'so', 'course', 'Castle', 'going', 'Yakaza', 'lot', 'kids', 'then', 'Franco', 'borrow', 'Punisher', 'get', 'son', 'back', ""n't"", 'will', 'kill', 'Berkowitz', 'So', 'Yakaza', 'headquaters', 'have', 'lot', 'shootouts', 'action', 'a**', 'whole', 'movie', 'wall', 'wall', 'action', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'displaying', 'martial', 'arts', 'ability', 'action', 'shot', 'edited', 'well', ""n't"", 'spliced', 'up', 'good', 'ol', 'shakey', 'cam', 'Great', 'lines', 'when', 'Berkowitz', 'What', 'do', 'call', '125', 'murders', '5', 'years', 'Punisher', 'work', 'progress', 'love', 'ending', 'liked', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'style', 'Luis', 'Gossett', 'JR', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'liked', 'Punisher', 'Harley', 'thought', 'was', 'bad', 'think', '2004', 'movie', 'lot', 'movie', 'workprint', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'flashbacks', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Jake', 'Berkowitz', 'when', 'were', 'partners', 'Frank', 'family', 'was', 'killed', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'more', 'violent', 'know', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'copy', 'Punisher', '89', 'workprint', 'comment', 'hope', 'get', 'special', 'edition', '89', 'Punisher', 'hopefully', 'extended', 'version', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'thought', 'plot', 'was', 'good', '89', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'favorite', 'Punisher', 'movie']",N/A
75261,A25RN8X70DSZLU,078401132X,JRP,"[0, 0]","Before I do a 2004 in film for The Punisher 04 I am going to do a review for the movie that came before it. The extremely underrated Punisher 1989 a movie that gets hated on for stupid reasons cause he doesn't have The Skull on his shirt like Hugh Jackman doesn't wear his yellow & black costume from The Uncanny X Men or that they changed things from the comic books but do you really think The Bat Man movies be it The Burton or Nolan films do you think they are 100 percent true to the comics. But I love The Motorcycle & Biker clothes it's a cool look for Frank Castle. As long as The Punisher is a man that lost his humanity & doesn't bother him if he brutally kills  mobsters pos & is a bada  *  * I'm happy. This movie rocks it's my favorite Punisher movie I do enjoy The 2004 movie for different reasons but the 89 movie at it's basic roots is a Punisher movie. I know some people who say who like this movie just like it as a so bad it's good guilty pleasure movie no for me I love this movie it's my favorite Dolph Lundgren movie although I really like Men Of War so if I ever see that movie again I will make my mind up on which Lundgren movie is my favorite. This movie was suppose to come out in 1989 around the time of Tim Burton's Batman another movie I really love. New World was going out of business so it was released straight to video it had a $9 million budget it looked like it belonged in a theater & I look at a movie like The Robocop remake that had a $130 million budget & had the worst action I have ever seen. I haven't got into this review The Punisher 1989 was made for $9 million it had a release overseas to a really bad box office & released in The US straight to video in 1991.  Directed by Mark Goldblatt he hasn't done much in the field of directing but he's been a long time editor movies such as Rambo First Blood part II, Terminator 1 & 2, Commando, Predator 2 & True Lies. So he understood what went into went into making an action movie. The movie stars Dolph Lundgren as Frank Castle & The Punisher, Louis Gossett Jr as Jake Berkowitz, Jeron Krabbe as Gianni Franco, Kim Miyori as Lady Tanaka, Brian Rooney as Tommy Franco & Nancy Everhard as Sam Leary. The story is sometime around the mid 80's Frank Castle's Wife & 2 Daughters were killed by a car bomb that was meant for him Frank Castle was believed to be killed in the explosion when he was trying to save his Family when the fire caught up to the engine & the car blew up. Now on youtube I have seen the deleted scenes from a workprint that shows Frank Castle as a Cop along with his Partner Jake Berkowitz on this stake out you're also introduced to this woman who is posing as a Pro  s  t  it  u te who is that lady named Sam Leary you meet later on in the movie. These scenes show Frank Castle cutting up with his partner joking & being a human. They show where Frank Castle gives these papers to this Mobster named Gianni Franco to appear in Court. Franco asks 1 of his men about killing Castle he tells him he's taken care of it. It goes from there to his Wife & Daughters being killed in the explosion. The extended opening I wish would be released on a DVD or Blu Ray cause the only US release there is, it the 1 from 99 that is a bare bones release. The movie starts off The Punisher has already been established where in the past 5 years he's killed 125 mobsters in the past 5 years so he lost his humanity which I believe cause I've seen people who have lost a spouse or child to tragic circumstances & some of them have gone crazy. I mean Dolph looks tired & out of his mind. The opening music by Dennis Dreith is awesome it just sets a mood. This Mobster named Dino Moretti has been cleared of all charges with Castle Family murders so he goes home & throws a party with his fellow wise guys & The Punisher gets in his Mansion Moretti's Men are making the rounds this man catches a knife to the chest he kicks another guy off a balcony then this other mobster is killed with a makeshift noose. The Punisher surprises Moretti & kills him the sets off an explosion. Then you have Jake Berkowitz who was Frank Castle's Partner he believes that Frank is still alive & is The Punisher. Then you have this Detective named Sam Leary who was on that stake out with Frank Castle & Jake Berkowitz which that image is on the back of The DVD case & she believes Frank Castle is The Punisher too they go & look for him. Gianni Franco has returned to the states cause The Punisher has weakened all of the crime families & now they're going to work together this informant for The Punisher named Shake tells him a drug shipment is coming into the harbor tonight. The Punisher is watching what this group is doing you have a group of thugs are doing a group of ninja's from The Yakuza show up & they go after The Mobsters. The Punisher goes into action he takes a Cross Bow shoots a guy in the chest he has a rope attached to the arrow & uses to zip line goes into action this Ninja tries to take this van full of drugs off The Punisher manages to kill him & the van goes into the harbor he's attacked by The Ninja's The Punisher goes into the harbor he makes it look like they killed him. The Punisher Franoc's Organization wired & overhears Franco & his Men talking to Lady Tanaka the head of The Yakuza she wants to take control of the crime activities in the city Franco refuses 1 of his Men gets in Lady Tanaka's face she puts him on the ground & she tells them they will be forced to work with them she has her men kidnap the crime bosses kids during these scenes 1 of them has an old lady who is I guess a Nanny or a Grnadma she's & killed by The Yakuza in front of these 2 little girls. This movie has no mercy. Lady Tanaka is going to put them in a Human Trafficing Ring which is more believable than what they did in Punisher War Zone where your bad guys are some guy from The Wire a show I never have watched & Percy from The Green Mile acting like complete goof a  *  *  es. Anyway Punisher gets word from Shake about what's happening since it's kids in danger he will get them back. Berkowitz & Sam find out The Yakuza are in town. The Punisher goes into this illegal underground club ran by The Yakuza he crashes through the ceiling window takes an M 60 goes to town shoots up a bunch of slot machines kills a couple of Yakuza members & just wrecks shop. Berkowitz & Sam go through the aftermath The Police believe that The Punisher took the kids Berkowitz is like no he shows her a picture of Castle's Daughters. The Punisher goes to this Theme Park & heads into The Fun House where he fights off some Ninjas & these fights are really good cause you don't get these kind of fights in movies anymore they try to do them all like Paul Greengrass with a ton of annoying shaky cam it's an annoying trend. Mark Goldblatt kept the camera steady & didn't do these super quick cuts. You have 1 these Ninja's that is Lady Tanaka's Step Daughter uses a chain pulls The Punisher off his bike he's ganged up & is put in some kind of torture device Lady Tanaka asks The Punisher some questions the movie has humor that totally works it's either dry humor or tongue & cheek like when he's asked a question The Punisher asks are the questions true, false or multiple choice. Lady Tanaka asks him who sent him he relies ""Batman."" They give The Punisher wit & smart alec attitude unlike in The Spider Man movies & when they tried to be funny in those movies they failed. When she leaves The Punisher tells her to have a nice day. They have also captured Shake & he's been hooked up to 1 of the torture machines. So they're going to be tortured The Punisher manages to break free he tells these 2 Yakuza to come over to him he grabs 1 of their guns kills them he puts that guy who was the torture expert on the machine he finds out where the kids are being kept he leaves the device on that pulls your body apart. Then The Punisher steals a bus there's this guy who is on the bus he has some booze he yells that he missed his spot The Punisher stops the bus let's the guy off & gives him a Bus Pass. He goes to where the kids are being kept he kills these 2 Yakuza's he gets these kids to the bus he's told that Tommy is still in there he is Gianni Franco's Son he also rescues this little girl that was looking for her doll Tommy sends that girl to The Bus like I said in a review on my older account Tommy is 1 brave MF'er. He tries to help The Punisher but he's caught by them The Punisher gets outside & is chased by The Yakuza 1 of them jumps on The Bus but he goes head 1st through the bus then The Punisher tosses him out of the bus on the street & he's ran over. You have another 1 of The Yakuza hanging on the side of the bus the kids are trying to knock him off he eventually falls off he's ran over The Punisher knocks these 2 Yakuza's in this truck into a Pest Control Truck where they wreck & it causes an explosion. There's this police barricade he lets the kids off he's arrested where in the holding cell Berkowitz talks to him he asks him why didn't he come to him for help. He tells him that he's sick what do you call a 125 murders in 5 years Punisher:""A work in progress."" Which feels like something The Punisher would totally say. Meanwhile these Mobsters were killed by Lady Tanaka when they poised their drinks she takes this mobsters gun puts it in his mouth & kills him. Lady Tanaka would eat both Howard S  ain't & Jigsaw from Warzone alive. Franco needs The Punisher to get his Son back while The Punisher is being taken off to Prison or whatever they attack the armored truck he's taken by Franco's Men. Franco pleads with The Punisher & tells him that he wishes he could change what happened The Punisher doesn't want to have anything to do with Franco so he has had Berkowitz captured & will have him killed if he doesn't help him & there's a deleted scene in The Workprint that shows Berkowitz being kidnapped. I know people say ""Oh The Punisher is helping the bad guys."" He has no choice cause they're going to kill his friend & there's a kid that's in danger. He even tells Franco that after this he's dead. They head off after Lady Tanaka then you have Berkowitz ask this guy that needs to go to The Bathroom he uncuffs him & let's him go to The Bathroom he asks if there's an IQ test for this job he says no then Berkowitz says I didn't think so he knocks him & then this other mobsters comes in with a pizza & he's like hey I got the pizza Berkowitz beats him down & takes a slice of pizza & proceeds to eat it on his way out. I love the humor in this cause it's actually funny, witty & clever. The Punisher & Franco go into the building The Punisher takes this guard out then he shoots this Yakuza dead who passing through the hallway. Then they get on an elevator Franco says ""You know there's a limit to revenge."" The Punisher:""I guess I havent' reached mine yet."" On the top floor they gun down a lot & I mean a lot of these Yakuza. You even have Franco kill a Yakuza member that didn't even know was behind him. The Punisher has Skake set off this device knocked the lights out in the complex they surprise these 4 Yakuza's & gun them down. Franco goes to find Tommy while The Punisher fights off these 2 Yakuza Dolph Lundgren has a really good fight this 1 Yakuza comes after The Punisher with a chain & he takes away The Punisher Double Barrel Shot Gun. Dolph Lundgren shows off his martial arts skills. He ends up impaling that guy with sword & sticks him to a wall. He takes on a 2nd Yakuza in fight where The Punisher kicks this thing that has sharp spiky points. The girl playing Lady Tanaka's Daughter does a good job working with Dolph Lundgren in their fight it's a really good old school down & dirty fight he ends up breaking her neck. Lady Tanaka makes Franco get on knees & put his gun in his mouth & pull the trigger. Lady Tanaka laughs & this villain is truly evil. The Punisher come through takes a throwing star throws it at her neck & kills her. Then Franco reunites with his Son but not before trying to kill The Punisher he thanks him for taking his competition out & in 5 years he will have the most powerful crime organization in the world & the boy he just saved will inherit all of it when he dies. Tommy sees what's happening he tries to stop his Dad The Punisher & Franco fight over the gun The Punisher eventually gets a hold of it & kills Gianni Franco. Tommy swears he's going to kill him The Punisher tells him to go ahead & do it. He gets on knees he doesn't care if he shoots him in the head cause The Punisher is dead inside. Tommy breaks down The Punisher tells him to grow up to be a good man cause if not he will come after him. The piece of music in this scene by Dennis Dreith  is awesome & it really makes it an even more powerful scene. Then you have Berkowitz come in & The Punisher is gone he goes out on balcony & yells out Franks name. It shows The Punisher in The Sewer & he says he still talks to G  o  d & wonders if what he's doing is still right or wrong.The Punisher 1989 is just an awesome movie I mean you got a great portrayal of the character as well he knows how to fight knows martial arts you know. Great fight scenes they aren't clean their down & dirty. Action scenes are well done well shot all 4 of them. Characters that I care about an awesome score by Dennis Dreith interesting mob boss villains that you hate. Mark Goldblatt did a great job directing. Dolph Lundgren was great. Louis Gossett Jr was really good. Jerone Krabbe did a really good job. Nancy Everhard was really good. Kim Miyori did a great job. Brain Rooney was not annoying child actor he did a very good job. Punisher 89 I don't get why people think it's a bad movie I don't want to understand it you might like it if you watch as a different interpretation of The Punisher. When you get to basics it's a Punisher movie.

75262,A2VUP5US1F5HG5,078401132X,K. Jump,"[1, 3]","Marvel's  Punisher has long been one of my favorite comic book characters.  Not really a superhero, the Punisher is a flesh & blood mortal possessed by an insatiable hunger for vengeance on the underworld which murdered his wife and children.  Very much an anti-hero, the Punisher is the ultimate vigilante who brings retribution to those whom the law either will not or cannot, neither asking nor giving any quarter in his unending one-man war on criminals everywhere.New World International's 1989 adaptation of the benighted comic book crusader is better than its usually given credit for.  Starring the oft-maligned Dolph Lundgren, ""The Punisher"" largely succeeds in bringing the comic to life.  Lundgren's raw, atheletic presence dominates the picture, and if Lundgren doesn't bring home any Oscars he proves once again to be a highly capable action hero, which is more than most people can lay claim to.  While the script isn't exactly philosophical, Lundgren infuses his character with menace, nobility, and a certain tragic weariness that comes off just right, while the two brief opening and closing inner dialogues between the Punisher and God add great emotional depth to the story.Lou Gossett Jr. is his usual excellent self as the cop out to crack the Punisher's case and also the vigilante's best friend, and Nancy Everhard is pleasant (if unnecessary) as Gossett's partner while Jerden Krabbe is tough and believable as a mobster that the Punisher must form an uneasy alliance with. A down-on-his-luck actor who becomes the Punisher's street informant, a ruthless female Yakuza and her high-kicking mute daughter round out the impressive cast of characters.The sets are mean and dark, the action hard-hitting and well-staged, and the overall atmosphere gritty and exciting.  Unlike some action flix, this one doesn't waste any time getting revved up, either.  The body count starts almost as soon as the opening credits are over.  Director Mark Goldblatt sets up one unflinching action shot after the other like ducks in a shooting gallery.  The score is excellent, and fits both character and story perfectly.Having said all that, there are some significant flaws.  The plot itself is quite good (the Punisher's war on crime is interrupted by an invasion of the local mob by they Yakuza, who kidnap all the mobsters' children forcing the Punisher to become a rescuer of the innocent instead of an avenger of the guilty).  However, the script has a lot of holes and the dialogue is sometimes silly. Moreover, like most modern comic book adaptations, the dialogue is often vulgar--ironic considering most of the Punisher's fans were and are probably quite young.  But that says more about our culture and where it's at than it does this partular movie, and in any event it's a lot less raunchy or bloody than the likes of ""Blade"" (another comic book movie).  I doubt that many modern teenagers would be even remotely offended.  Further, one frequently gets the feeling more than one important scene ended up on the cutting room floor. I bet there is some potentially restored footage that might flesh things out a bit. Ultimately this is a low-budget movie with all the inevitable weaknesses--more money would have created more spectacular action and bigger thrills.But if this is a B-movie it's still a good one.  Now of course a big-budget Punisher is on the way and I'm looking forward to it.  Hopefully it will be even bigger and better than this version, but right now that still remains to be seen.  Regardless, if you were ever a fan of the Punisher comic book or just like a solid action flick, you could do a whole lot worse than this one.",4,UNDERRATED SHOOT 'EM UP,1079568000,"03 18, 2004",2004,3662,"['Marvel', 'Punisher', 'long', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'Not', 'really', 'superhero', 'Punisher', 'flesh', 'blood', 'mortal', 'possessed', 'insatiable', 'hunger', 'vengeance', 'underworld', 'murdered', 'wife', 'children', 'Very', 'much', 'anti-hero', 'Punisher', 'ultimate', 'vigilante', 'who', 'retribution', 'whom', 'law', 'either', 'will', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'asking', 'giving', 'quarter', 'unending', 'one-man', 'war', 'criminals', 'everywhere.New', 'World', 'International', '1989', 'adaptation', 'benighted', 'comic', 'book', 'crusader', 'better', 'usually', 'given', 'credit', 'Starring', 'oft-maligned', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Punisher', 'largely', 'bringing', 'comic', 'life', 'Lundgren', 'raw', 'atheletic', 'presence', 'picture', 'Lundgren', ""n't"", 'bring', 'home', 'Oscars', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'highly', 'capable', 'action', 'hero', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'lay', 'claim', 'script', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'philosophical', 'Lundgren', 'character', 'menace', 'nobility', 'certain', 'tragic', 'weariness', 'off', 'just', 'right', 'two', 'brief', 'opening', 'closing', 'inner', 'dialogues', 'Punisher', 'God', 'add', 'great', 'emotional', 'depth', 'story.Lou', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'usual', 'excellent', 'self', 'cop', 'crack', 'Punisher', 'case', 'also', 'vigilante', 'best', 'friend', 'Nancy', 'Everhard', 'pleasant', 'unnecessary', 'Gossett', 'partner', 'Jerden', 'Krabbe', 'tough', 'believable', 'mobster', 'Punisher', 'must', 'form', 'uneasy', 'alliance', 'down-on-his-luck', 'actor', 'who', 'Punisher', 'street', 'informant', 'ruthless', 'female', 'Yakuza', 'high-kicking', 'mute', 'daughter', 'round', 'impressive', 'cast', 'characters.The', 'sets', 'are', 'mean', 'dark', 'action', 'hard-hitting', 'well-staged', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'gritty', 'exciting', 'action', 'flix', 'one', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'getting', 'revved', 'up', 'either', 'body', 'count', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Goldblatt', 'up', 'one', 'unflinching', 'action', 'shot', 'other', 'ducks', 'shooting', 'gallery', 'score', 'excellent', 'character', 'story', 'perfectly.Having', 'said', 'are', 'significant', 'flaws', 'plot', 'quite', 'good', 'Punisher', 'war', 'crime', 'interrupted', 'invasion', 'local', 'mob', 'Yakuza', 'who', 'kidnap', 'mobsters', 'children', 'forcing', 'Punisher', 'become', 'rescuer', 'innocent', 'instead', 'avenger', 'guilty', 'However', 'script', 'lot', 'holes', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'Moreover', 'most', 'modern', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'dialogue', 'often', 'vulgar', 'ironic', 'considering', 'most', 'Punisher', 'fans', 'were', 'are', 'probably', 'quite', 'young', 'more', 'culture', 'where', 'partular', 'movie', 'event', 'lot', 'less', 'raunchy', 'bloody', 'likes', 'Blade', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'doubt', 'many', 'modern', 'teenagers', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'remotely', 'offended', 'Further', 'one', 'frequently', 'feeling', 'more', 'one', 'important', 'scene', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'bet', 'potentially', 'restored', 'footage', 'might', 'flesh', 'things', 'out', 'bit', 'Ultimately', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'inevitable', 'weaknesses', 'more', 'money', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'more', 'spectacular', 'action', 'bigger', 'thrills.But', 'B-movie', 'still', 'good', 'one', 'Now', 'course', 'big-budget', 'Punisher', 'way', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'bigger', 'better', 'version', 'right', 'now', 'still', 'be', 'seen', 'Regardless', 'were', 'ever', 'fan', 'Punisher', 'comic', 'book', 'just', 'solid', 'action', 'flick', 'could', 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'worse', 'one']",N/A

The Punisher is sent to the rescue, and there are tons of gunfights, fistfights, and swordfights. One scene is really wasted, though. At one point, Lundgren and Jeroen Krabbe arrive in a room full of ninjas. They simply open fire and kill them all. Bummer. I was hoping for a cool fight scene, not some bland massacre. This movie seems to have a bad case of ADD. Random scenes of violence are intermixed with scenes of Lundgren riding on a motorcycle in the sewers to Krabbe whining about being in the mafia.

Palkowski ""marskee""","[1, 2]","While rooting around in a bargain bin at a local store, I came across this, the supposedly bad 1989 adaptation of a great Marvel comic. Being at a cheap price, I thought ""What have I got to lose?"" Action fans, your ship has come. This film has it all: bullets, babes, bombs, spiked balls, shruikens, impalings, poison, a Harley, and the mob. Dolph Lundgren stars as Frank Castle, an ex-cop who went underground (literally) as a vigilante, known to the media as ""The Punisher"", after the deaths of his wife and kids thanks to a car bomb, and after being declared legally dead. His line of work includes killing mobsters because of a hatred against them (they planted the family-killing car bomb), and because of this, The Franco crime family has weakened, along with dozens of others, forcing Gianni Franco, the leader of one of the families, to come in and take control of them. Franco has a plan to bring the families together as one unit (for ordinary citizens, this is bad news). However, this has attracted the attention of the Yakuza, Asia's most powerful crime syndicate, and their boss, Lady Tanaka, who decide to take over the families and all their interests. In order to sway the mobsters to their cause, they kidnap their children. Now Castle must fight to save the lives of the children of the people he has fought against for five years, while at the same time fighting alongside the man who killed his family.The cast works well, with Lundgren having a good performance, and Lou Gossett Jr. as Castle's former partner, trying to prove that Castle is still alive and is The Punisher. The disc has a widescreen transfer, and grain show up sometimes, noticeably in the end credits. The extras are severly lacking, consisting of production notes that look like movie trivia strung together with no enhancement, a trailer for overseas distribution (the film went direct to video in the U.S.), and cast and crew bios. Not Artisan's best, but then again, some of their early releases have no features at all.

75269,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,078401132X,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","I have never read the ""Punisher"" comics, have only seen snatches ofPunisher: War Zone, and actually liked 2004'sThe Punisher; that is my extent of giving a fan's review of how this, the original film version, stacks up to its successors and source material. I am, however, a fan of Dolph Lundgren, and will do my best to review it as such and not stray over into territory which I'm ignorant of. With that said, no matter what you think of the film, this is definitely the vehicle that turned Dolph into a genuine action hero:  the guns, the muscles, and the martial arts came together in this like they had yet to do in Lundgren's early career. It's not exactly the Swedish Superman's best work, but it remains a worthy entry into the legacy of one of my favorite action frontmen.If anybody were to consider the three ""Punisher"" films a chronological trilogy, this version would fit pretty well between the 2004 remake and the 2008 offering, for it doesn't go into great detail about Frank Castle's origin other than an odd flashback showing the killing of his family. The plot follows Castle, an ex-cop presumed dead by all but his partner (Louis Gossett, Jr.,An Officer and a Gentleman), as he pursues his personal war on organized crime during a treacherous confrontation between the mafia family of Gianni Franco (Jeroen Krabbe,Left Luggage) and the Japanese Yakuza faction of Lady Tanaka (Kim Miyori,Metro). When the Yakuza kidnap the children of the heads of the American mob, Frank must decide whether to save the lives of the children or let their fate punish the people he had been hunting for years.From the tone of some of the reviews I've read, folks seem to prefer the most recent ""Punisher"" film over the first two for its indulgence in the dark and gritty-ness of the comic book...but to say that Lundgren's offering isn't dark and gritty is wrong; the problem is that the tone of the film is inconsistent. While it does get a bit lighter and more optimistic near the end, the rest of the film is of a very coarse, treacherous nature comparable to that of Steven Seagal'sOut for Justice. For at least the first half of the film, the movie feels like less of an outright action flick and more like a violent thriller with noir undertones. This, of course, means that action-freaks like me need to wait until about 45 minutes into the picture to get our dose of Dolph buttkicking, but it's generally worth waiting for: I counted three shootouts, four hand-to-hand fights, and one bus chase scene involving an amazing car-to-bus leaping stunt. The gunfights are generally old hat and not too imaginative, but the latter fistfights gave the film world the first taste of Lundgren's karate skills, which are presented in strong form for a made-for-TV picture.The only contendable aspects of the film involve the actors and their utilization. While Krabbe and Miyori make strong B-grade showings as lead villains and lifetime bit player Arthur Sherman has a fun but thankless role as Frank's drunk informant, it's up to the fans to decide whether or not Lundgren makes an acceptable Punisher; while not distinctly bad, I was disappointed that he doesn't necessarily play the part much different from a few other roles he's occupied as a bitter loner. As far as Louis Gossett's part goes, I'm not entirely sure why he's in the movie: while he would later team up properly with Lundgren inCover-Up, his character has next to no importance in the script and only has a single scene with Frank. Either his part seemed more vital during the early stages of making the film or they just attached him just for the sake of his name.For guys like me, this movie works better as a good old beat-`em-up action film with the benefit of being based on a comic book, but as far as Marvel devotees go, I'd imagine they have reason to be displeased with the film. Lundgren fans, add it to your collection...""Punisher"" fans, rent it along with the other two flicks and decide for yourself where this one stands.",3,"""Here is justice. Here is punishment.

Since Marvel found a new money source with the big screen adaptions of X-Men, Spider-Man, and Daredevil (not to mention the upcoming X-Men 2 and The Hulk), it's obvious this film will look far inferior to those, but I like this for what it is.  True, The Punisher isn't the best comic to film adaption in history (but it's far from the worst), but let's be honest; when the original comic had first started, it wasn't all that great, and those mid-late nineties relaunches weren't anything to write home about either (although the more recent Punisher books have been phenominal), and let's not forget this is one of the last one man army kill everything 80's films among the lines of Commando and Missing in Action, and I like it for what it is and isn't.  For the most part this film stays true to the roots of the comic, unlike other comic to film adaptions like Batman & Robin and Spawn.  Dolph Lundgren isn't the best actor in the world, but his stoic expressionless face and badass overall look suit the character of Frank Castle very well.  So there's no skull, no van full of weapons, so what?  Despite all that, The Punisher is still a good comic to film movie worth watching.  And yes, I have heard of an upcoming new Punisher movie, but something tells me Marvel should quit while they're ahead before one of they're films tanks mightily.",4,"""Here is justice, here is punishment, here in me""",1048896000,"03 29, 2003",2003,1431,"['honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bashing', '1989', 'adaption', 'comic', 'gotten', 'Marvel', 'found', 'new', 'money', 'source', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptions', 'X-Men', 'Spider-Man', 'Daredevil', 'not', 'mention', 'upcoming', 'X-Men', '2', 'Hulk', 'obvious', 'film', 'will', 'look', 'far', 'inferior', 'like', 'what', 'True', 'Punisher', ""n't"", 'best', 'comic', 'film', 'adaption', 'history', 'far', 'worst', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'when', 'original', 'comic', 'had', 'first', 'started', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'mid-late', 'nineties', 'relaunches', 'were', ""n't"", 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'more', 'recent', 'Punisher', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'phenominal', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'one', 'last', 'one', 'man', 'army', 'kill', 'everything', '80', 'films', 'lines', 'Commando', 'Missing', 'Action', 'like', 'what', ""n't"", 'most', 'part', 'film', 'true', 'roots', 'comic', 'other', 'comic', 'film', 'adaptions', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Spawn', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', ""n't"", 'best', 'actor', 'world', 'stoic', 'expressionless', 'face', 'badass', 'overall', 'look', 'suit', 'character', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'very', 'well', 'skull', 'van', 'full', 'weapons', 'what', 'Punisher', 'still', 'good', 'comic', 'film', 'movie', 'watching', 'yes', 'have', 'heard', 'upcoming', 'new', 'Punisher', 'movie', 'something', 'tells', 'Marvel', 'should', 'quit', ""'re"", 'ahead', 'one', ""'re"", 'films', 'tanks', 'mightily']",N/A

Do you like nothing better than sitting down with a beer and popping in Raw Deal, featuring Robert Davi?This film was made with you in mind.  Do you like cheap, violent flicks?  Lots of gunfire and bad guys getting riddled?  That's what The Punisher is, and then some.  It's pure comic book in every department.  The acting, the script, the plot, the violence.  Did I say violence?  There are spiked balls to the head, throwing knives, arrows, bullets, grenades, bullets, cars, handguns, blood.  The action is actually pretty damn good.  Look here--it seems to be one of the few significant production values on site here.  And director Mark Goldblatt has been an action film editor for years.Dolph Lungren keeps it simple here.  He scowls and broods.  His accent is croaky.  He's perfect as Frank Castle.  Just a guy with a mission.None other than Oscar winner Lou Gossett, Jr. has a major role here.  I don't know if Lou has serious alimony to pay or what, but at least his professionalism amidst the mayhem was comforting.  Also appearing is respected Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbe as a Mafia don.  Which reminds me, not one member of the so-called ""Italian Mafia"" here looks even remotely Italian.  Which is because the film was made in Australia (the comic book took place in New York) which explains just look a bit...foreign.So, to recap.  The story is ludicrous, the plot as riddled as Castle's victims, the acting at times laughable, etc.  But an absolute must for 80s action cinema.Complaints: I want more extras!

The first thirty minutes are boring andunoriginal. Whereas Christopher Nolan made good use of the first halfof Batman Begins to present a credible transition from rich man's sonto Dark Knight, Jonathan Hensleigh bores viewers to death by picturingFrank Castle as the perfect American family man who then loses hisbeautiful wife and perfect son in a cheap Mad Max rip off. In contrast,the 1989 low budget but far superior version started off smack in themiddle of the action with a seriously disturbed ex cop already on therampage and the reason for his decline into madness was graduallyexplained by means of flashbacks and memories form Louis Gousset Jrtrying to bring his old friend back into a sane life. But whereas thecomic book Punisher, brought to life by similarly huge 6' 6"" DolphLundgren in the first movie, becomes a bitter, meaner than hell, coldblooded killer with no compassion whatsoever, the 04 Frank Castle turnsinto your friendly neighborhood watchman who uses an ice cream cone to""torture"" his first victim. Batman Begins also has its share of humor,but it is subtle and not out of place. The bad guys don't fare muchbetter. Whereas Jeroen Krabbe also had his share of trouble with theYakuza in the 80s version, at least he was a serious gangster not to betaken lightly.

The Punisher Movie is to The Punisher Comic what The Phantom Menace is to The Empire Strikes Back.That is why I am so happy about the new Punisher film which is currently in production.The script has been put together by the sreenwriter of DIE HARD 3, and promises to be much more like the comics, and to be a dark, gritty action film. It has a much smaller budget than most of the other Marvel Movie productions, but it doesn't need any CGI or film-trick fanciness.It just needs good treatment.Though at the time as my writing this no actor has been cast for the lead, a character actor named Thomas Jane has been offered the part.He may prove to be just fine in the boots, but we'll have to see.Personally I believe the role begs for Stallone. He and The Punisher are both New York Italians, both in their fifties, and both tough and buff. Just look at some of the great cover art done (on some of the newer comics) by Tim Bradstreet. It makes the Punisher look just like Stallone.While The Punisher is supposed to be 8 foot tall and 500 pounds, we need to be realisitic here. We don't want some Mr. Universe playing him with all the acting talent of a braindead rodent.Stallone is just big enough, and he can act. Anyone who doubts his ability needs to sit down and watch the original ROCKY and FIRST BLOOD, and then watch his excellent, low-key performance in COPLAND.And anyone who doubts that he could pull off the role of The Punisher should sit down and watch his menacing performance in the remake of GET CARTER.America needs another vigilante film. FALLING DOWN was the last good one we had. DIRTY HARRY and DEATH WISH are fantastic movies. The new THE PUNISHER could easily follow suit.Leave this Barf Lundren version to collect dust on the video wharehouse shelves.

Louis Gosset Jr. plays the ex-partner who believes his partner is really alive and is ""The Punisher"" meanwhile bulllets fly and people die.Dolph Lundgren thankfully only says 5 words in the entire flick speaking chores are handled by Louis Gosset Jr. and Jeroen Krabbe who steals the show as the villian. However Dolph gets to display his true talents when he fights and shoots. Dolph also plays the part of ""The Punisher"" pretty well wether being tortured by nasty yakuza guards, getting his tail kicked by a female ninja or shooting 300 ninjas with an M.16 Dolph keeps the flick going at a relentless pace making the movie an actionpacked fun movie. Although people hate this it's more for the principal of the skull on the shirt, nost can't rise above it but I liked it and even though this is a B.movie it delivers the goods.

Dolph Lungdren was not a bad choice at all to play this part, just the direction they creators took wasn't the best to take. Let me start by mentioning that The Punisher here does not wear the famous skull on his shirt; it is the most important piece on a character like this. It would be like having superman without the ""S"" or batman with out the bat on his chest. Also, The Punisher here does not care about wearing armor...I mean come'on, what's the harm in wearing it? Anyways there are countless mistakes here. Like the number of kids Frank Castle has is wrong, how they were murdered is also incorrect.The plot for those unfamiliar is quite simple and straight forward. Frank Castle (Dolph Lungdren) is an ex cop turned vigilante, who will stop at nothing to kill the corrupt. It a simple story that has been seen countless times. But the adaptation here is...not the worst, but not exactly the best either. The action is neat, the story is ok, but there's just so many inconsistencies and cheesy dialogue that bring the film low.If you are a fan of the comic, buy it, if not than just skip it. Keep also in mind that this movie was made in the late 80's, meaning that it's one of the earlier adaptations of Marvel. The best adaptation to date is the 2004 movie with Thomas Jane.

If there was any indicator of the Punisher declining in popularity (not to mention comic-book revenues) in the early 90s, this movie is probably as good a harbinger as any! Sub-standard action sequences, the whole Vietnam-war veteran past of our anti-hero gone, his computer-whiz sidekick Microchip has been replaced by an alcoholic has-been stage actor, and he ain't even sportin' the big death's-head skull on his chest! And where's Jigsaw, our main man's most notable adversary? Aside from Pun himself, this flick has none of the other characters that made up his world in the comics!Dolph Lundgren's infamous stoicism works surprisingly well for the character-well, for the most part, anyway. Sadly, when he tries to do a few brief bits of happiness &amp; fear in this less-than-rousing actioner, it just looks forced, like they're beyond his emotional spectrum. Which they just might be, who knows. And Louis Gossett, Jr seems to be just biding his time between `Iron Eagle' sequels here. His ultra-hackeneyed-and-cliched performance as our anti-hero's former police partner has been seen many a time before in far better shoot-em-ups.Still, there are those silly moments of cheesy fun, which I like to experience in the movies I watch from time to time. Sadly, there ain't quite enough cheddary footage here to keep my interest for too long.

75296,A17OZZPTSFLTCO,078401132X,zo,"[0, 1]",This movie has always been a favorite of mine.  The story is fairly original and the acting is sufficient but not outstanding (this is to be expected in action movies though).  Dolph Lundgren was good at making The Punisher seem like the silent hunter constantly stalking it's prey.  The action scenes are well executed and the Martial Arts sequences are well done considering there was minimal choreography done while filming to ensure a more realistic look.  Fans of the B action movie genre will most likely take to this film but in any case I'd say rent it first before deciding to purchase it.,4,"Awesome action, SO-SO acting",1030406400,"08 27, 2002",2002,598,"['movie', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'story', 'fairly', 'original', 'acting', 'sufficient', 'not', 'outstanding', 'be', 'expected', 'action', 'movies', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'was', 'good', 'making', 'Punisher', 'seem', 'silent', 'hunter', 'constantly', 'stalking', 'prey', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'considering', 'was', 'minimal', 'choreography', 'done', 'filming', 'ensure', 'more', 'realistic', 'look', 'Fans', 'B', 'action', 'movie', 'genre', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'take', 'film', 'case', ""'d"", 'say', 'rent', 'first', 'before', 'deciding', 'purchase']",N/A
