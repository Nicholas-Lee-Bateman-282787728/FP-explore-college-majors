182663,AMICVV9N2U2R4,1560395532,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[0, 0]","Scooby-Doo is one of my favourite cartoon characters, but I can't say the same about his cartoons. This feature-length animated film breaks that mould. It's a treat both visually and theme-wise. Scooby already is a big star thanks to his Saturday morning cartoon show, which is loved near and far. Yet he harbours a dream of becoming a big primetime star in Hollywood. With Shaggy as his bossy manager, Scooby steps into show business and tries to impress a producer with some hilarious preview clips showing Scooby's versatility. Additionally, Shaggy makes him attend events of high society to impress the big shots, predictably not going according to plan as Scooby is... well, Scooby. Is fame and fortune as great as Shaggy thinks? Perhaps people need Scooby-Doo more than he needs Hollywood?As is the case with animated features, the animation is allowed to go further here. The movie's highlights are the preview clips Scooby and Shaggy present to the producer, including parodies of the likes of Charlie's Angels, Love Boat and Saturday Night Fever (with the catchy song ""Gorgeous Scooby-Doo""). My favourite is the last of these, where Scooby dances in an unashamed scene of disco lights that quickly morph into everything from bubbles to dog dishes. All the while, Scooby Doo becomes alive like he rarely does on the cartoon. More touching scenes arise when his friends look through his baby photo book and reminisce about his good old days. Never mind the fact that Shaggy is even more intolerable than usual; in fact, you get the distinct feeling that Shaggy wants Scooby to be famous more than Scooby does.I've been waiting to see something like this ever since I first saw Scooby-Doo. An animated treat of the character a generation fell in love with, and me, that explores his versatility. And for the price, a fan has no excuse to pass it up.

182664,A1DKUXY2DE0EDY,1560395532,Daniel,"[1, 2]","I'm sorry to disagree with the people who liked this film, but it wasn't very good at all. I know that Hanna-Barbera wants to make Scooby Doo a true star, BUT I think they chose the wrong plot for this movie. However, this movie had good points, but it's not good enough. Here are some of the pros/cons for this movie:Pros:The actors from Hollywood make their apperance.They had spin-offs from the old films I loved.The ""Scooby Doo, We Need You"" chant from America (which really touched me).Cons:Spin-Offs from the old films were WAAAYYY over the top. It was very confusing and too strange.Flashbacks. I know that it's really good to see how Scooby was chosen by Mystery Inc., but not in a movie that is about Hollywood.Shaggy. WHY??? Why did they have to treat Shaggy like crud?! It's not fair. I liked it better when he was Scooby's pal and always afraid with Scooby and the way he and Scooby are live baits and always trap the monster with courage in their hearts, but in this movie, it's all about Shaggy and the one word I'm looking for: DEMANDING!!! It's like in this movie he forgets that he's with Mystery Inc. and he wants Scooby to have a better career in Hollywood. All of those were completely wrong! Come on HB, this is my favorite character your treating very poorly!Overall, I was disappointed in this movie. If you want to see Scooby and the TRUE Shaggy, pick up Scooby Doo on Zombie Island, or Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase. However, if you really feel like Scooby deserves to be a movie star, go ahead and pick up this movie.",2,Oh gosh...,1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,1544,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'disagree', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'know', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'make', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'true', 'star', 'BUT', 'think', 'chose', 'wrong', 'plot', 'movie', 'However', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'points', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'Here', 'are', 'pros/cons', 'movie', 'Pros', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'apperance.They', 'had', 'spin-offs', 'old', 'films', 'loved.The', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Need', 'chant', 'America', 'really', 'touched', '.Cons', 'Spin-Offs', 'old', 'films', 'were', 'WAAAYYY', 'top', 'was', 'very', 'confusing', 'too', 'strange.Flashbacks', 'know', 'really', 'good', 'see', 'how', 'Scooby', 'was', 'chosen', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'not', 'movie', 'Hollywood.Shaggy', 'WHY', 'Why', 'did', 'have', 'treat', 'Shaggy', 'crud', 'not', 'fair', 'liked', 'better', 'when', 'was', 'Scooby', 'pal', 'always', 'afraid', 'Scooby', 'way', 'Scooby', 'are', 'live', 'baits', 'always', 'trap', 'monster', 'courage', 'hearts', 'movie', 'Shaggy', 'one', 'word', ""'m"", 'looking', 'DEMANDING', 'movie', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'Scooby', 'have', 'better', 'career', 'Hollywood', 'were', 'completely', 'wrong', 'Come', 'HB', 'favorite', 'character', 'treating', 'very', 'poorly', 'Overall', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'Scooby', 'TRUE', 'Shaggy', 'pick', 'up', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Zombie', 'Island', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Cyber', 'Chase', 'However', 'really', 'feel', 'Scooby', 'be', 'movie', 'star', 'go', 'ahead', 'pick', 'up', 'movie']",N/A
