I remember distinctly the surprised look on her face when we started immediately giving her exactly what she needed without having to fumble around trying to figure it out (and sometimes never figuring it out). BUY IT!!! You will NOT regret it.You can skip the filler; this really didn't need 2 DVDs. But the actual crying sound interpretation parts are priceless.,5,"It's the ""Rosetta Stone"" for baby cries!",1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,486,"['DVD', 'set', 'soooo', 'price', 'watching', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'daughter', 'was', ""'saying"", 'cry', 'remember', 'distinctly', 'surprised', 'look', 'face', 'when', 'started', 'immediately', 'giving', 'exactly', 'what', 'needed', 'having', 'fumble', 'around', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'sometimes', 'never', 'figuring', 'out', 'BUY', 'IT', 'will', 'NOT', 'regret', 'it.You', 'can', 'skip', 'filler', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', '2', 'DVDs', 'actual', 'crying', 'sound', 'interpretation', 'parts', 'are', 'priceless']",Dunstan Baby Language -- Learn the universal language of newborn babies
1069986,A2P0UK3QTSS093,B000PDZ9SU,"HeartofAvalon ""abellygoddess""","[6, 7]","As a neonatal and postpartum nurse, I can attest that these sounds are universal, and that because they are related to reflexes, they are consistent and correspond with what Ms. Dunstan claims in her program.  In fact, I think most people that work with infants can tell what each cry means, but perhaps those, like me, didn't know the particulars of HOW they knew.  Basically, we know from just being around a lot of babies. And, every baby sounds slightly different.  So, while I have to learn a lot of babies each day, the good news is you will only have to learn YOUR baby, and his/her particular nuanced sounds.  This makes the program that much easier.Okay, bad parts right up front:1. The program could have fit on 1 DVD and it is OBSCENELY priced.2. There are far too many testimonials on the disks. (Yes, testimonials are great, but shouldn't be 1/2 of the content.)3. Not all the sounds are easy to pick up.  I still have trouble distinguishing upper wind and lower wind sounds (however infant body language helps).4. Why wait to hear the ""Neh"" cry to know your infant is hungry, when if you watch body language such as a more alert state, turning of the head, sticking tongue out repeatedly, a sucking sound, etc. you will already know?  Those are the signs that your baby is hungry, long before a cry every comes out.Now, the good parts:1. The program actually works.2. Parents have more confidence in themselves and the first several weeks after learning how to discern cries (They become THEIR BABY's expert).3. Infants that have their needs met, cry less and have a happier overall disposition.4. Parents get A LITTLE MORE sleep.5. Ms. Dunstan gives a variety of effective solutions to the common needs related to the 5 cries.Taking a new baby home can be stressful for a new parent.  It's even stressful for ""repeat"" parents.  Many parents are amazed at how much they have forgotten from their first to second babies, even in just a couple of years.) While the only REAL drawback of this program is price, it is a valuable tool to know your baby's communication, and be able to respond with confidence and appropriate action.Whether you buy this program or wing-it on your own without this program, in a few short weeks, YOU will be the expert on your infant.  Yes, docs, nurses, grandparents may be baby experts, but YOU will be the expert regarding YOUR baby.  Since this program allows parents to get a leg-up on the process of discerning what their infants needs (and gives easy solutions to those needs), I can't imagine why parents wouldn't want to know all they can, right away, for a great start in parenting. (I also recommend this for grandparents, babysitters/nannies, aunties and uncles, and anyone else that will be interacting regularly with your infant.)",4,This RN says Dunstan Baby Language is GREAT for parental confidence,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,2785,"['neonatal', 'postpartum', 'nurse', 'can', 'attest', 'sounds', 'are', 'universal', 'are', 'related', 'reflexes', 'are', 'consistent', 'correspond', 'what', 'Ms.', 'Dunstan', 'program', 'fact', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'work', 'infants', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'cry', 'perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'particulars', 'HOW', 'knew', 'Basically', 'know', 'just', 'being', 'around', 'lot', 'babies', 'baby', 'slightly', 'different', 'So', 'have', 'learn', 'lot', 'babies', 'day', 'good', 'news', 'will', 'only', 'have', 'learn', 'YOUR', 'baby', 'particular', 'nuanced', 'sounds', 'program', 'much', 'bad', 'parts', 'right', 'up', 'front:1', 'program', 'could', 'have', 'fit', '1', 'DVD', 'OBSCENELY', 'priced.2', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'testimonials', 'disks', 'Yes', 'testimonials', 'are', 'great', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', '1/2', 'content.', '3', 'Not', 'sounds', 'are', 'easy', 'pick', 'up', 'still', 'have', 'trouble', 'distinguishing', 'upper', 'wind', 'lower', 'wind', 'sounds', 'however', 'infant', 'body', 'language', '.4', 'Why', 'wait', 'hear', 'Neh', 'cry', 'know', 'infant', 'hungry', 'when', 'watch', 'body', 'language', 'such', 'more', 'alert', 'state', 'turning', 'head', 'sticking', 'tongue', 'repeatedly', 'sucking', 'sound', 'etc', 'will', 'already', 'know', 'are', 'signs', 'baby', 'hungry', 'long', 'cry', 'out.Now', 'good', 'parts:1', 'program', 'actually', 'Parents', 'have', 'more', 'confidence', 'first', 'several', 'weeks', 'learning', 'how', 'discern', 'cries', 'become', 'THEIR', 'BABY', 'expert', '.3', 'Infants', 'have', 'needs', 'met', 'cry', 'less', 'have', 'happier', 'overall', 'disposition.4', 'Parents', 'get', 'LITTLE', 'MORE', 'sleep.5', 'Ms.', 'Dunstan', 'variety', 'effective', 'solutions', 'common', 'needs', 'related', '5', 'cries.Taking', 'new', 'baby', 'home', 'can', 'be', 'stressful', 'new', 'parent', 'even', 'stressful', 'repeat', 'parents', 'Many', 'parents', 'are', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'forgotten', 'first', 'second', 'babies', 'even', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'only', 'REAL', 'drawback', 'program', 'price', 'valuable', 'tool', 'know', 'baby', 'communication', 'be', 'able', 'respond', 'confidence', 'appropriate', 'action.Whether', 'buy', 'program', 'wing-it', 'own', 'program', 'few', 'short', 'weeks', 'YOU', 'will', 'be', 'expert', 'infant', 'Yes', 'docs', 'nurses', 'grandparents', 'may', 'be', 'baby', 'experts', 'YOU', 'will', 'be', 'expert', 'regarding', 'baby', 'program', 'parents', 'get', 'leg-up', 'process', 'discerning', 'what', 'infants', 'needs', 'easy', 'solutions', 'needs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'parents', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'can', 'right', 'away', 'great', 'start', 'parenting', 'also', 'recommend', 'grandparents', 'babysitters/nannies', 'aunties', 'uncles', 'anyone', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'interacting', 'regularly', 'infant']",Dunstan Baby Language -- Learn the universal language of newborn babies

First of all, each DVD is only 30 minutes long, and includes 15 minutes of testimonials on each DVD.  Within the remaining 15 minutes per DVD, you learn 3 words apiece, followed by basic baby care techniques that aren't particularly well presented.
