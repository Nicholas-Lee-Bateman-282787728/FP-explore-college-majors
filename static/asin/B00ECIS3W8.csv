I liked the dynamics of this family's life... .living and working together, working out problems and difficulties together.  It was impressively a real life family situation.

Good overall story, but could have benefited from a little more editing and focus.

1666659,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00ECIS3W8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[20, 20]","The Canadian television movie &#34;The Horses of McBride&#34; (also known as &#34;Christmas Rescue&#34;) is one of those feel good and family friendly endeavors that you might see on the Hallmark Channel. If that sounds like a selling point, you are undoubtedly the target audience for this spirited tale of overcoming adversity. While the movie is inspired by an actual occurrence that made national headlines, quite a few liberties were taken with the source material. In essence, this has been turned into a coming-of-age story for a young heroine who discovers a sense of purpose and a renewed connection with her father during the ordeal. &#34;The Horse of McBride&#34; tells the story of a pair of abandoned horses that are found starving in the Rockies and the community that banded together in a rescue effort. Led by the headstrong Mackenzie Porter, you know her sheer force of determination will guide us to a happy ending. But that's the formula of these types of movie, the outcome is never in doubt--neither about the horses or about the family or about the town. This Christmas story is designed for one purpose and that is to provide a little holiday uplift. And I suppose it does.When we meet Porter, she is a typical teenaged girl facing the loss of her family home. Although financial hardship has crippled her parents (Kari Matchett and Aiden Quinn) and brother, she takes the impending move worse than anyone. In fact, for half of the movie, she is a bit of a brat. She is cold in her dealings with a boy with obvious feelings for her, suspicious of others that lend assistance to the horses, and unyielding to her parents' feelings. It wouldn't cross her mind that she isn't the center of the world! To many, that might make her plucky and spirited but I thought she could use a good dose of reality. As Christmas approaches, she needs a stamp of veterinary approval before anyone will even consider a rescue. So she nurses the horses, spends all of her time on the mountain, and spends funds her family can ill afford to keep them alive. It's a noble effort that captures the imagination of a nation. I find it ironic that in real life we don't pay much attention to the horrors that befall people everyday, but we're always about a good animal story! There are many obstacles along the way. Facing them down, a father and daughter will find a mutual respect.I know for a fact that many of the reviews that come in for &#34;The Horses of McBride&#34; will be five star raves. What's not to love? It's a stirring story to be sure, but that doesn't make it a great movie. Its greatest assets, however, are Matchett and Quinn. Although Matchett doesn't have a lot to do, she is earnest and believable. As for Quinn, he's simply terrific. Despite the shortcuts of the screenplay, this is one of his best roles of late. I enjoyed &#34;The Horses of McBride&#34; despite its formulaic nature, but it might have been stunning as a more realistic feature film. The scenery is lovely, the message is pleasant and hopeful. But one of the biggest mistakes comes at the resolution. The coincidence of who owned the horses has a major impact on the central family. Too convenient and utterly contrived, they just went one step too far. I'm sure I'll get hate mail for my jaded viewpoint because this movie will find an audience that treasures every moment of the experience. A recommendation, despite my misgivings, largely for the great Quinn performance.
