Each character is played and  developed so well that by the end of the show, now I can hardly wait for the Second Season to arrive in the mail. EACH actor as well as the programs creators must be applauded for their outstanding, deeply moving, uniquely individual personae  that are portrayed. I was not even aware of the existence of the show until I found out that Catharine Bell had continued her career after the incredible job she did during all of the JAG years.  That's the reason I purchased the series--I gambled on Catharine.  And then to find the entire group so talented and convincing, was a real treat.  For those who love JAG, NCIS, The Unit, or any other military-focused series, this is a very welcome addition.  Extremely enjoyable is the ""partial cast group question-answer session with the produces, or creators of the show.""  The actors show their true selves during this session, and seem to have developed a family- comeraderie, which I found very refreshing. I think the productions values are even higher because of it.
