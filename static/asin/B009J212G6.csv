1597090,ATW37REQSOCFL,B009J212G6,"Andy Powell ""Brokeback Barbra""","[1, 3]","I've been watching a lot of gay cinema on DVD lately, ranging from excellent to poor.  This one falls somewhere in between.  As a gay man myself, I have a lot of trouble buying the idea of a gay man being able (or willing) to have sex with a woman -- and not just once, but numerous times.  Even in a silly comedy this is incredibly unrealistic as far as I'm concerned, and even somewhat off-putting.  (And no, I am *NOT* a misogynist.  I love women, I just don't sleep with them.  A psychic once told me, ""You are attracted to women's minds and hearts and men's bodies.""  Makes sense to me.)The performances are all very good though, including that of writer-director Jonathan Lisecki -- which leads me to my other major problem with this DVD.  Although he is very funny in the movie itself, he also participates in the disc's audio commentary -- and therein lies the problem.  I have always appreciated audio commentaries (when they're done well) as they are a wonderful tool in learning more about the filmmaking process, the craft of acting, the history of the major movie studios, and other topics at hand.  However, when someone doing an audio commentary has a speaking voice or a way of speaking that is personally irritating to me, often I cannot sit through the entire commentary without becoming extremely annoyed.  Several times I have foregone listening to a commentary on a film I'm interested in because I cannot stand the sound of the commentator's voice.  (I discussed this once with the great animation historian Jerry Beck, who told me that [obviously] DVD commentators are chosen for their knowledge of the subject at hand, not for what they sound like.)  As you've probably guessed by now, I find Mr. Lisecki's voice *AND* his manner of speech *VERRRY IRRITATING*.  It's not his extreme effeminacy that irritates me so much (no, I am also not a self-hating homophobe), it's what I perceive -- rightly or wrongly -- as his equally extreme affectedness.  He comes across (to me, at least) as very, very pretentious and affected.  His voice also has a quality of monotonousness to it that drives me up a wall.  All in all, I'd have to liken Mr. Lisecki's commentary to the sound of fingernails scraping across a chalkboard -- for 90 friggin' minutes!

1597091,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B009J212G6,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[10, 10]","Matt (Matthew Wilson) is a young gay man who works in a comic store.  He's fresh out of a six year failed relationship, and having problems finding someone new.  He commiserates with his longtime best friend, yoga instructor Jenn (Jenn Harris), who is also lonely, and suggests that they have a baby together.  Matt is open to the idea, but a bit stunned when Jenn vetoes the ""turkey baster"" method, and insists they conceive the ""old fashioned way.""  Uh, huh.Their initial attempts make for some rather amusing almost-slapstick laughs.  But neither anticipated it would take months of such attempts, which made it a bit difficult to date others on the side, while ""saving themselves"" for each other. When they compromise and decide to try do-it-yourself artificial insemination, Matt's campy friend Nelson (actually, the film's writer/director, Jonathan Lisecki, in a scene-stealing role), offers his assistance, since he went through the same process with a lesbian friend. At the same time, both Matt and Jenn find too-hot-to-wait lovers, leading to some guilt feelings and possible regrets.This is a very funny, somewhat over-the-top comedy, with excellent acting and direction.  Appropriate for mixed gay/straight audiences, and definitely a positive outlook on the concept of gay parenting as well as supportive straight allies.  Won several awards at gay and regional film fests,and nominee for a 2013 Independent Spirit Award.  Not rated, but would be a light R for sexual content, although there is no nudity.  DVD extras include a short subject on which the full-length film is based, as well as several deleted scenes (Don't miss checking out the one with Jenn and ""Logan."")

If you are not afraid of homosexual humor, ""Gayby"" will be a pleasant discovery. It certainly was for me; hell, for that matter, this movie should be funny for anyone, despite their sexual preferences. And I mean funny.Matt (Matthew Wilkas) works in comic book store. He is gay, and, at one scene in the film, he tells a friend who just broke up with his boyfriend that ""only gay guys read Wonderwoman."" On the other hand, Jenn (Jenn Harris), his roommate, is a horny, straight woman who works as a yoga instructor. Jenn desperately wants to get pregnant and she asks Matt to be the father. However, Jenn doesn't want to do artificial insemination; she wants to get pregnant the old-fashioned way: by having sex. Matt agrees and he tries his best. All this happens at the same time that he is trying to find a boyfriend. These situations provide very funny moments and situations, which are aided by great, smart writing and acting by Wilkas and Harris, as well as the rest of the perfect cast, all glued together well by director Jonathan Lisecki. In fact, Lisecki gets great laughs and lines as a character named Nelson.""Gayby"" was an awesome find, a little gem that will keep you laughing from beginning to end.

Therefore, I was prepared to hate this movie.

Personally, I get that need met by our dog, but that's just me.  I particularly liked that the reproducers realized they weren't particularly great parents, and needed each other, as well as each other's spouses, just to get parenting ALMOST right.  By film's end, I was completely convinced that these four people would each contribute something fabulous to the child's upbringing, and that the kid would be remarkably well adjusted because of the influence of all four parents.

1597103,A2KARIOEGE27DW,B009J212G6,"MountainMan ""David""","[1, 1]","Gayby pulls no punches! It is right in your face from the very beginning. In fact, I was so very pleasantly surprised that I did *not* have to sit through the usual boring, get to know the characters beginning, that I actually sat up and paid attention. Basically, the trailer *is* the beginning. They get right to the main course, you know exactly everything that is going on and you laugh your head off. This is how a comedy should be made. No waiting for the humor here!True, there are some places where you are hit with the seriousness of it all and the impact of what they are doing has on all those involved as well as the possible consequences of not, up front, agreeing to a few hard and fast rules and realizing that having a baby should not be a selfish decision. But overall, this is a very good script, well acted and well directed.I was not at all ""put off"" by the 1 over-the-top stereotypical part because in real life, there will always be people who think that they need to ""be"" gay instead of just being themselves; playing the stereotypical role is easier than becoming fully in touch with who they are as a person. There will always be people who do not feel they ""fit in,"" there will always be a gay sub-culture  that appeals to them and, there will always be people within those sub-cultures who feel the need to be ""special"" by acting ""over-the-top."" In other words, for many people the word ""gay"" first and foremost means ""in your face"" instead of simply identifying the gender with whom they sleep. Unfortunately, there are stereotypes on either side of the spectrum comprised of people who *want* to be like those that fit what they see instead of just being themselves. ""Gay"" does not identify me. *I* identify me. Problem with just being yourself is that your average, everyday person makes for a very boring movie.My RANT aside, this is a very good movie.

1597106,A224BKBLXVA859,B009J212G6,Rocky Sunico,"[0, 0]","At first glance the movie has &#34;indie&#34; written all over it given the quality of the film, the somewhat less-than-ideal lighting and the lack of significant musical scoring. And I point this out not because indie movies are bad, but more to remind you not to judge a book by its cover. It's far too easy to dismiss a movie as bad based on some of these cues alone when there's a lot more good to be found once you've really dug into things.The core premise of the movie may not seem all that new, but I certainly appreciated how Lisecki gave things a new spin to keep things interesting. And asking a gay man to father a child naturally is an inherently funny idea when you try to imagine it. All the more so when you have Matthew Wilkas trying to perform that role. Add in how they don't get Jenn pregnant right away and this leads to repeated efforts to get her pregnant night after night and it's certainly a good framework to develop a story around.And the characters do have interesting stories on their own outside the fertility angle. Jenn of course is trying to figure out what she wants in life and being everyone's whipping girl at the yoga studio certainly isn't a life goal. Matt has his own desires to break into the comic book scene and yet remains deathly afraid of bumping into his ex, who also works in the industry. These are nice little complexities that help round out the characters and do make for a nicely meaty story. Plus Wilkas is rather meaty himself and he manages a performance that oddly reminds me of Michael C. Hall from Six Feet Under.Admittedly the movie is more of the smart kind of funny and definitely not the slapstick kind of funny. So you won't exactly be rolling on the floor laughing due to silly antics but you will find yourself amused at the various one-liners and zingers thrown about and of course the peculiarity of some of the situations the characters find themselves in. And this is pretty consistent throughout the movie, thus setting a nice even tone that is on the lighter side of somber.I think the best moment in this movie is outside of the little nightly sessions between Jenn and Matt but instead involves Jenn's sister, Kelly (Anna Margret Hollyman). There's a scene later in the movie when Kelly confronts Jenn about whether or not she's truly serious about having a baby as a single woman. And I really don't want to spoil it - let me just assure you that it's a brilliant piece of writing that felt nicely genuine and had me and my partner Tobie both agreeing that Kelly as a character certainly deserves some Best Sister awards or something.Gayby is a refreshing comedy given its smart writing, fleshed-out characters and certainly interesting conflicts and plot twists. It's not the best movie out there, but it's one of the more innovative ones and it certainly deserves a viewing regardless of your stance single parenthood involving gay fathers - or your sexual orientation either.",4,"Surprisingly Delightful - And Pretty Smart, Too!",1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,2955,"['first', 'glance', 'movie', '34', 'indie', '34', 'written', 'given', 'quality', 'film', 'somewhat', 'less-than-ideal', 'lighting', 'lack', 'significant', 'musical', 'scoring', 'point', 'out', 'not', 'indie', 'movies', 'are', 'bad', 'more', 'remind', 'not', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'bad', 'based', 'cues', 'alone', 'when', 'lot', 'more', 'good', 'be', 'found', 'once', ""'ve"", 'really', 'dug', 'things.The', 'core', 'premise', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'new', 'certainly', 'appreciated', 'how', 'Lisecki', 'gave', 'things', 'new', 'spin', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'asking', 'gay', 'man', 'father', 'child', 'naturally', 'inherently', 'funny', 'idea', 'when', 'try', 'imagine', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'have', 'Matthew', 'Wilkas', 'trying', 'perform', 'role', 'Add', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Jenn', 'pregnant', 'right', 'away', 'repeated', 'efforts', 'get', 'pregnant', 'night', 'night', 'certainly', 'good', 'framework', 'develop', 'story', 'characters', 'do', 'have', 'interesting', 'stories', 'own', 'fertility', 'angle', 'Jenn', 'course', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'life', 'being', 'everyone', 'whipping', 'girl', 'yoga', 'studio', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'life', 'goal', 'Matt', 'own', 'desires', 'break', 'comic', 'book', 'scene', 'yet', 'deathly', 'afraid', 'bumping', 'ex', 'who', 'also', 'industry', 'are', 'nice', 'little', 'complexities', 'help', 'round', 'out', 'characters', 'do', 'make', 'nicely', 'meaty', 'story', 'Wilkas', 'rather', 'meaty', 'performance', 'oddly', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Under.Admittedly', 'movie', 'more', 'smart', 'kind', 'funny', 'definitely', 'not', 'slapstick', 'kind', 'funny', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'be', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughing', 'due', 'silly', 'antics', 'will', 'find', 'amused', 'various', 'one-liners', 'zingers', 'thrown', 'course', 'peculiarity', 'situations', 'characters', 'find', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'movie', 'thus', 'setting', 'nice', 'even', 'tone', 'lighter', 'side', 'somber.I', 'think', 'best', 'moment', 'movie', 'little', 'nightly', 'sessions', 'Jenn', 'Matt', 'instead', 'Jenn', 'sister', 'Kelly', 'Anna', 'Margret', 'Hollyman', 'scene', 'later', 'movie', 'when', 'Kelly', 'Jenn', 'not', 'truly', 'serious', 'having', 'baby', 'single', 'woman', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'let', 'just', 'assure', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'writing', 'felt', 'nicely', 'genuine', 'had', 'partner', 'Tobie', 'agreeing', 'Kelly', 'character', 'certainly', 'Best', 'Sister', 'awards', 'something.Gayby', 'refreshing', 'comedy', 'given', 'smart', 'writing', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'conflicts', 'plot', 'twists', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'there', 'one', 'more', 'innovative', 'ones', 'certainly', 'viewing', 'regardless', 'stance', 'single', 'parenthood', 'involving', 'gay', 'fathers', 'sexual', 'orientation']",Gayby

The problem is she can't find her Prince Charming and all her relationships last a mere, few months.
