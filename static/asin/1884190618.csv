The idea was very simple and important and could have made a great film. As it was, poor actors working with even worse dialog made this a most difficult film to watch. Even though I nearly turned this movie off after the first 10 minutes and again after every additional 10 minutes, it does have a few good points. You will have to search hard to find them and that is if you can get past the first 10 minutes.

I neither laughed nor cried.  I cannot even get focused enough to become angry about this movie -- and if you've seen my other reviews you know I can be intense when a movie is terrible (see: Yossi & Jagger, Primer)  I'll give you the particulars and then suggest a more interesting movie below.Forget that every one of the actors in this ""college"" movie is old enough to have kids in high school, if not college.The only thing remotely interesting here is the closeted lesbian who keeps popping up and unfortunately the writers never cashed in on that aspect.  How many times must I say that in a good script things tie-in so as to complete the plot.That gay-bashing was so obvious and trite.  That is to say, the viewer can see it coming but not in any moving way.GREAT NEWS!  For a really good ""lost love"" genre movie, I suggest ""Longtime Companion"" -- but see it with someone because you will be crying.  Seriously, don't watch it alone.  You'll need a really good hug when it's over.  For a more upbeat, happy-time ""love you-why won't you love me the way I want you to love me"" genre movie, I suggest ""Get Real"", which is no less age-appropriate than ""Defying"" and is a joy to watch.",2,"Stale, lifeless and underwhelming, but not terrible",1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,1306,"['simply', 'nothing', 'moving', 'movie', 'entirely', 'bereft', 'suspense', 'drama', 'emotion', 'laughed', 'cried', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'focused', 'enough', 'become', 'angry', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'reviews', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'intense', 'when', 'movie', 'terrible', 'see', 'Yossi', 'Jagger', 'Primer', ""'ll"", 'give', 'particulars', 'then', 'suggest', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'below.Forget', 'one', 'actors', 'college', 'movie', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'kids', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'here', 'closeted', 'lesbian', 'who', 'popping', 'up', 'unfortunately', 'writers', 'never', 'cashed', 'aspect', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'must', 'say', 'good', 'script', 'things', 'tie-in', 'so', 'complete', 'plot.That', 'gay-bashing', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'trite', 'say', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'not', 'moving', 'way.GREAT', 'NEWS', 'really', 'good', 'lost', 'love', 'genre', 'movie', 'suggest', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'see', 'someone', 'will', 'be', 'crying', 'Seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'need', 'really', 'good', 'hug', 'when', 'over', 'more', 'upbeat', 'happy-time', 'you-why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'love', 'way', 'want', 'love', 'genre', 'movie', 'suggest', 'Get', 'Real', 'less', 'age-appropriate', 'Defying', 'joy', 'watch']",N/A

195266,A26L2EQ97ML3OW,1884190618,"""bruce452""","[8, 11]","This is a cute movie.. not a great one, to be sure, but worth watching.  Its gotten a lot of positive reviews in the gay media, as does just about anything that comes out today that shows a couple of guys shirtless and kissing on the lips once or twice.Let's face it, movie companies realize there is an exploding interest in gay themed films, and they're rushing product to market.  I understand this one was made on a very slender budget in a very short time.  It is more than a little reminiscent of some badly done teen movies of the 80s in which every character was disgustingly good looking but otherwise had no business being in front of a camera.The two leads in this film rise above that somewhat and are appealing in their roles.  Daniel Chilson as Griff has great &quot;guy next door&quot; looks, plus a shy smile that will make many a heart flutter.  Don Handfield as Pete is a much stronger character and is perhaps the better actor of the two, although it's hard to tell since he spends most of the movie in a coma after a gay bashing.Most gay coming out movies are set in high school.  This one takes place in college, which is why I bought it.  But other than Pete, the emotional and intellectual level of the characters is very high-schoolish to me.  Griff in particular seems to be on about the 15 year old level when it comes to understanding what's going on between the two of them.One of the characters in the film drives a white Jeep that is completely open while another drives a black SUV with darkly tinted windows, oversized driving lights and a menacingly loud stereo.  Can you guess which is the good guy and which is the bad guy?  The rest of the film is no more complex.  The script has gaps in it.  The filmmakers assume the audience will already know a lot about gay relationships and coming out and will be able to fill in the gaps in the story; this is probably true of most who will go to the trouble to see the film, but it would have been more satisfying if the story were more complete and coherent.  The dialog is about on an intellectual level with the average Stallone movie, which is of course only slightly higher than in an XXX film.The other characters in the fillm have even less depth than the two leads except for Niclaus Lange, who plays Todd, a straight frat-brother and friend to both Griff and Pete and who is so overbearingly earnest, tolerant and understanding as to be creepy.  A plus for me was the depiction of heterosexual male relationships in the fraternity.  I avoided the frat scene in college and nothing in this film suggests I missed anything.  Heterosexual male bonding is an oxymoron.In a departure from the norm for gay films, there is no naked butt scene in the entire movie.  There are numerous references to Vaseline which the scriptwriter apparently believes are hilarious.Still, if you're gay you'll probably relate to the characters in this film and their story.  For all its shortcomings, if I had to choose at a multiplex between this and say, American Pie or Rocky, or 100s of other vapid Hollywood blockbusters, I'd choose to watch these two try to figure out what love means.",3,Is this merely gay-sploitation?,1010880000,"01 13, 2002",2002,3154,"['cute', 'movie..', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'be', 'sure', 'worth', 'watching', 'gotten', 'lot', 'positive', 'reviews', 'gay', 'media', 'just', 'anything', 'out', 'today', 'couple', 'guys', 'shirtless', 'kissing', 'lips', 'once', 'twice.Let', 'face', 'movie', 'companies', 'realize', 'exploding', 'interest', 'gay', 'themed', 'films', ""'re"", 'rushing', 'product', 'market', 'understand', 'one', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'slender', 'budget', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'more', 'little', 'reminiscent', 'badly', 'done', 'teen', 'movies', '80s', 'character', 'was', 'disgustingly', 'good', 'looking', 'otherwise', 'had', 'business', 'being', 'front', 'camera.The', 'two', 'film', 'rise', 'somewhat', 'are', 'appealing', 'roles', 'Daniel', 'Chilson', 'Griff', 'great', 'quot', 'next', 'door', 'quot', 'shy', 'smile', 'will', 'make', 'many', 'heart', 'flutter', 'Don', 'Handfield', 'Pete', 'much', 'stronger', 'character', 'perhaps', 'better', 'actor', 'two', 'hard', 'tell', 'most', 'movie', 'coma', 'gay', 'bashing.Most', 'gay', 'coming', 'out', 'movies', 'are', 'set', 'high', 'school', 'one', 'place', 'college', 'why', 'bought', 'other', 'Pete', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'level', 'characters', 'very', 'high-schoolish', 'Griff', 'particular', 'be', '15', 'year', 'old', 'level', 'when', 'understanding', 'what', 'going', 'two', 'them.One', 'characters', 'film', 'white', 'Jeep', 'completely', 'open', 'black', 'SUV', 'darkly', 'tinted', 'windows', 'oversized', 'driving', 'lights', 'menacingly', 'loud', 'stereo', 'Can', 'guess', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'rest', 'film', 'more', 'complex', 'script', 'gaps', 'filmmakers', 'assume', 'audience', 'will', 'already', 'know', 'lot', 'gay', 'relationships', 'coming', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'fill', 'gaps', 'story', 'probably', 'true', 'most', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'trouble', 'see', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'satisfying', 'story', 'were', 'more', 'complete', 'coherent', 'dialog', 'intellectual', 'level', 'average', 'Stallone', 'movie', 'course', 'only', 'slightly', 'higher', 'XXX', 'film.The', 'other', 'characters', 'fillm', 'have', 'even', 'less', 'depth', 'two', 'leads', 'Niclaus', 'Lange', 'who', 'Todd', 'straight', 'frat-brother', 'friend', 'Griff', 'Pete', 'who', 'so', 'overbearingly', 'earnest', 'tolerant', 'understanding', 'be', 'creepy', 'plus', 'was', 'depiction', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'relationships', 'fraternity', 'avoided', 'frat', 'scene', 'college', 'nothing', 'film', 'missed', 'anything', 'Heterosexual', 'male', 'bonding', 'oxymoron.In', 'departure', 'norm', 'gay', 'films', 'naked', 'butt', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'are', 'numerous', 'references', 'Vaseline', 'scriptwriter', 'apparently', 'are', 'hilarious.Still', ""'re"", 'gay', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'relate', 'characters', 'film', 'story', 'shortcomings', 'had', 'choose', 'multiplex', 'say', 'American', 'Pie', 'Rocky', '100s', 'other', 'vapid', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', ""'d"", 'choose', 'watch', 'two', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'love']",N/A

Griff finds out and later remembers a car he saw driving by as his boyfriend was walking away yet is scared to go to the police or to tell any of his friends that he was with the guy right before it happened.  I thought the movie was interesting and ultimately rewarding and a pleasure to watch.  Events change Griffs thinking and there is a very satifying ending.

195269,A1KT01DYA3C067,1884190618,"Daniel J. Maloney ""Daniel J. Maloney""","[67, 71]","&quot;Defying Gravity&quot; is a touching drama centered around two college fraternity brothers, Griff and Pete.  In the midst of raging hormones, constant partying and the girls who hang out, the two become  lovers.Pete has a much more developed sense of himself and realizes his  environment doesn't exactly match his emerging sexuality. He moves out of  the frat house in order to be true to himself, to his emerging sexual  identity.Early in 'Gravity', it becomes pretty evident that beyond their  friendship and sexual attraction, the two boys are at very different places  as far as addressing the reality of who they are.After each encounter  with Pete, Griff redoubles his efforts at seeking out girls for dates. He  works hard at convincing himself that what he has with Pete is &quot;just  sex&quot; and that he's not gay. Yet, it's apparent that he isn't  concentrating on his schoolwork with any success and that somewhere inside  himself, he is indeed in conflict and is becoming increasingly aware of his  true sexuality. Despite his efforts with women, Griff's attraction to Pete  is transparent.In the meantime, Pete's doing well in school and making  friends at the local gay coffeehouse. He's actively working toward having  his life match his identity. Pete clearly loves Griff and would like more  of a commitment from him.Following an argument between the two at the  coffeehouse, Pete is critically injured and ends up in a coma after he is  the victim of a gay bashing.Griff feels terrible about what happened  but is so afraid of the personal implications, that he stays away. He  doesn't tell the police that he and Pete were together just before the  beating, or that they argued or that he saw a suspicious truck at the time  Pete was leaving. Yet, he doesn't do well in denial either. He grows  depressed and withdrawn. He is paralyzed by his abandonment of Pete and his  own internal struggle with his sexuality.Todd, a fellow fraternity  brother and friend of both boys, won't let Griff get lost in himself. He  spends time with him, offers his help, encourages him to speak. Pete is  reluctant. He fears losing Todd the second he lets him know what's on his  mind. Griff comes clean. When he is finally able to say that he loves Pete  more than anything else he is sure about in life, Todd immediately hugs  him. His support for Griff is automatic and unconditional.Todd helps  Griff begin to undo some of his betrayal of Pete. He goes with him to file  a police report on the suspicious vehicle and takes him to the hospital to  visit the still unconscious Pete.Life at the frat house takes an  immediate turn for the worse in Griff's discovery that guys in his own  fraternity are responsible for beating up Pete. They are arrested, but  nothing can be the same for Griff. He can't continue hiding who he is, and  he knows he has to move out of the house in order to get honest with  himself.Griff's major breakthrough happens quickly after this  realization. He moves into Pete's house, even though Pete is still in the  hospital, and he starts to begin to spend time at the gay  coffeehouse.When Pete finally comes out of the coma, Griff apologizes  for his abandonment and  cowardice. Pete is reluctant to believe that Griff  has changed. Yet, Griff, no longer sitting on the fence, makes his love  absolutely clear to Pete. He acknowledges that coming out is scary. He  tells Pete he's going to need a lot of help along the way. He Pete for his  help.&quot;Defying Gravity&quot; ends on the most hopeful of notes. We  fully expect Pete and Griff to make a go at being an openly gay couple.While on one level, Gravity may sound like the same old story of boy  denying - boy coming to terms with his sexuality, yet, this simple and  beautiful film does an excellent job in depicting the challenges  of  discovering oneself gay in a very straight world.Writer and director,  John Keitel has created a compelling contemporary story. He does well in  being faithful to presenting a film that conveys the essence of this story,  keeping the lurid or sensational deliberately spare. The film can be shown  in a multitude of settings for entertainment and educational purposes.The college fraternity setting is quite believable for the story being  told. Getting honest with oneself about being gay in an all-male, extremely  heterosexual, and highly homophobic environment is a daunting challenge.  The major players each courageously come to terms with themselves, and do a  fine job in their portraits.Pete, played by actor Don Handfield, is out  of the action for much of the film. However early on, he manages to convey  his character as a likeable and courageous young man struggling through a  very difficult passage in his life.Dan Chilson has the challenge of  playing Griff and he does it well. We first meet a boy who is fearful and  dishonest with himself. His character grows up through the film and Chilson  convincingly evidences this transformation.The most outstanding acting  in the film is in the character of Todd, Griff and Pete's good friend. The  role is played by Niklaus Lange. Lange has the looks and bearing to play  the hulking heterosexual, all-American boy-next-door. He gives us a  sensitive and empathic performance in the role of Todd.Defying Gravity  is enjoyable entertainment. It deals with serious issues with tremendous  sensitivity and realism. I hope this film is shown in homes, high schools  and frat houses throughout the country. It can be a platform for lots of  values clarification, and hopefully some changed minds in those who see  it.Highly recommended!",5,An Important Contemporary Film,959817600,"06 1,

The story is about a young college student/frat brother ""Griff"" who's hiding his sexual preference from the world. Although he is in love, he denies his feelings from even himself until his boyfriend ""Pete"" is bashed for being at a gay hangout, and is rendered comatose and in critical condition. Griff is the only witness to the crime but in order to brings Pete's assailents to justice, must step forward and admit that he was with Pete at the gay coffee shop the night of the attack.Griff must decide if his love for Pete is as important to him as his status, and reputation on campus. Can he possibly make things right with Pete while keeping his image together, or must he sacrifice his own lifestyle?

It deals with a frat brother named Griff who has this secret and is unable to come to terms with his sexuality and does his best to hide it until his frat brother who he has been having an affair with gets beaten so bad that they don't know if he will survive or not. Griff saw the truck involved but by coming forward his sexuality might come to the forefront so he lies at first but goes into a depression trying to deal with doing the right thing. Griff's best friend, Todd, knows there is something wrong and he takes Griff away from it all to talk to him to find out what is up. Griff finally spills it all to Todd while chatting up on a mountain top and finally admits he is in love with Pete and Todd more or less tells him that if he loves Pete like Todd loves his girl then Griff should do whatever it takes to be with Pete.

195273,A2F5OMNCGD430M,1884190618,"Diane ""dmt277""","[4, 5]","I absolutely love this movie.  It is a very realistic depiction of how gays and lesbians deal with coming out of the closet in college.  Griff and Pete met and fell in love in a fraternity house.  Pete moves out of the house and starts living a semi-open gay lifestyle.  Griff is still living in the house and is still completely closeted.  The relationship between Griff and Pete quickly disintegrates because Pete is getting tired of Griff's refusal to quit living a lie--Pete gets really upset when Griff starts flirting with this girl right in front of him.  Their relationship is basically over--in that they have had a big fight--so they go their separate ways and Pete is immediately gay bashed and spends most of the remainder of the movie in a coma.  Griff's life is immediately thrown into turmoil as he starts to come to terms with the guilt he feels over the fact that he was not there for Pete when he needed him most--Griff had seen the truck following Pete down the street and he had this feeling that something was not right but he ignored it and drove off.  As Griff's life starts to come apart he meets this girl who is a lesbian and is also firmly in the closet--they become friends of sorts and offer some emotional support for each other as they deal with the issue of coming out.  Griff also has problems with his best friend in the house because he is grieving for Pete and trying to figure out what he is going to do, and he cannot tell his friend any of this because he is not out--When Griff and his friend first find out that Pete is in the hospital they go and there is police detective there that asks them questions and Griff completely denies having been with Pete right before he is attacked.  However, Griff comes to realize that he loves Pete enough to come out of the closet, and he eventually tells his friend, who urges him to go to the police, and does not act at all negatively to the news that his best friend is gay.There is one really poignant moment where Griff's best friend and girl friend are displaying affection in public and Griff and Pete are standing right next to each other, watching this going on, with looks of such envy on their faces that it breaks my heart that there are so many people out there who react so negatively to homosexual relationships.",4,Wonderful Movie,986256000,"04 3, 2001",2001,2307,"['absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'very', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'how', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'deal', 'coming', 'closet', 'college', 'Griff', 'Pete', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'fraternity', 'house', 'Pete', 'house', 'living', 'semi-open', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'Griff', 'still', 'living', 'house', 'still', 'completely', 'closeted', 'relationship', 'Griff', 'Pete', 'quickly', 'Pete', 'getting', 'tired', 'Griff', 'refusal', 'quit', 'living', 'lie', 'Pete', 'really', 'upset', 'when', 'Griff', 'flirting', 'girl', 'right', 'front', 'relationship', 'basically', 'over', 'have', 'had', 'big', 'fight', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'Pete', 'immediately', 'gay', 'bashed', 'most', 'remainder', 'movie', 'coma', 'Griff', 'life', 'immediately', 'thrown', 'turmoil', 'come', 'terms', 'guilt', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'there', 'Pete', 'when', 'needed', 'most', 'Griff', 'had', 'seen', 'truck', 'following', 'Pete', 'street', 'had', 'feeling', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'ignored', 'drove', 'off', 'Griff', 'life', 'come', 'apart', 'girl', 'who', 'lesbian', 'also', 'firmly', 'closet', 'become', 'friends', 'sorts', 'offer', 'emotional', 'support', 'other', 'deal', 'issue', 'coming', 'out', 'Griff', 'also', 'problems', 'best', 'friend', 'house', 'grieving', 'Pete', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'friend', 'not', 'out', 'When', 'Griff', 'friend', 'first', 'find', 'out', 'Pete', 'hospital', 'go', 'police', 'detective', 'questions', 'Griff', 'completely', 'having', 'been', 'Pete', 'right', 'attacked', 'However', 'Griff', 'realize', 'Pete', 'enough', 'come', 'closet', 'eventually', 'friend', 'who', 'go', 'police', 'not', 'act', 'negatively', 'news', 'best', 'friend', 'gay.There', 'one', 'really', 'poignant', 'moment', 'where', 'Griff', 'best', 'friend', 'girl', 'friend', 'are', 'displaying', 'affection', 'public', 'Griff', 'Pete', 'are', 'standing', 'right', 'next', 'other', 'watching', 'going', 'looks', 'such', 'envy', 'breaks', 'heart', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'react', 'so', 'negatively', 'homosexual', 'relationships']",N/A

Litton,"[8, 10]","Oftentimes, a movie will try to get a point across through its plot, but will not have enough issues or occurrences for the audience to relate to in order for them to fully experience the message hoping to be conveyed. &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; is not one of them. The plot deals with real issues that an occur to anyone on a daily basis. It also teaches a lesson in the end, a lesson in tolerance and equality. It is one of the best gay-themed films ever made.Griff is your average, everyday, boy-next-door kind of guy, who enjoys going to college and being part of a fraternity of close-knit jocks. Or so we think. The opening of the film shows him leaving someone's house, hurrying to dress and running out the door and back to his sorority house. He seems distanced from the other guys, though he tries to hide it from them. That morning, he and his buddy give their friend Pete a ride to classes, and there seems to be tension between Pete and Griff in the car. Throughout the day, Griff goes out of his way to ignore Pete, and at the end of the day, they finally confront one another, and we learn that Griff and Pete have been fooling around for a while. They decide to meet the next night to talk things over, and Griff realizes that Pete wants more from their being together than he can handle at the moment. They leave the bar in an argument, and Pete goes off by himself down an alley, where he is followed by a strange truck. The next day, Griff is confronted by his fraternity as to his whereabouts the previous night, when a newscast appears showing Pete's face, and a story about his brutal beating and hospitalization. This sends Griff into a whirlpool of emotion, as he begins to analyze his feelings for Pete, his homosexuality, and how he is going to begin to deal with coming out.The best thing about this film is that it does not have the regular, big-budget movie look to it, which makes it all the more believable and realistic. The story and dialogue all sound very natural, and they all work together in conveying the emotions and actions that are felt and taken by the characters. Griff is the emotional core of the film, as he reminisces back to his good times with Pete, and as he tries to comprehend what he is feeling and what he will do about it.John Kietel is perfect in his direction of the actors and the filming of the movie. Unlike some movies with homosexual storylines and themes, this one chooses to focus more on the monogamous side of same-sex relationships, rather than use it to exploit the sexual side of gay living.The actors for this film do such a great job in making each character articulate and real. Daniel Chilson portrays Griff, and does so with a great deal of powerful, moving emotion. His performance will evoke tears in those who can relate to what he is going through, not to mention that his good looks will keep all viewers awake and attentive. Niklaus Lange plays Pete, and while he has his time onscreen, he makes us believe in what he feels for Griff, that he wants something more than just one-nighters and pleasurable thrills.Not to be taken lightly, but ultimately enjoyable and moving, &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; is one of the finest films for the gay genre, telling a haunting story that has become a painful reality for many in this world.

195280,A1LX3GUBXMR3RS,1884190618,FilmFoodie,"[0, 0]","I'm compelled to make excuses for this. The story is relatable and remains vital as the ""It Gets Better"" campaign tells us. The theme of questioning and coming out during campus life is oddly absent from the genre. An internet search for films regarding sexuality conflicts on campus turned up two fine English period pieces; the excellent and even applicable Maurice (1987) and the fine but boring and indistinct Another Country (1984). Neither would be identifiable to ""questioning"" beer chugging jocks on heartland campuses. (And now that the coming out theme has been otherwise explored ad-nausea, this theme may never be more coherently realized in film.) Still, the movie presents itself as painfully trite, mawkish and all but ruined by terrible acting. I'm talking cheap 80s horror film style bad acting. The script, although straight forward and skin deep was coherent and seems like it would be less dumb delivered with some complexity. Our protagonist has information that could aid in the investigation of a hate crime against his secret lover, but he struggles with speaking up for fear of being found out. It's a good premise but ineffectually handled in this film and the acting performances remove the urgency from the events. Perhaps if the movie were from the 80s not 1997 it might be more acceptable. Because even though films of the genre remained few and far between in the late 90s, more so than today, they were already leaps and bounds better and more courageous than this. Here, the kiss is revealed in the end although the affair is happening from the opening scene, as well with the one short PG13 scene of physical intimacy. I could accept it as a device for a story of a boy slowly coming to terms with himself, but this film is not that nuanced.Its style has more in common with old school ""After School Special"" TV movies, although television movies like Consenting Adult (1985) and Doing Time on Maple Drive (1992) were better and for their time more daring.My recommendation is to see this if you haven't seen much of this genre, you like your controversy rated PG13 and you prefer a simple straight forward story of coming out in college.

Unfortunately this movie is not one of them.  While the essence of the film is the odd  relationship between the two main charactres; one who is confident in being  gay Pete (Don Handfield), the other just discovering himself, Griff (Daniel  Chilson), the acting of Chilson isn't up to par and destroys the movies  meaning, I felt that it could have been better.  Also the writing of some  of the most important scenes is to mild, detracting the emotion of the true  relationship and meaning of the film.  The comibination of the poor writing  at the critical moment and poor acting by Chilson does not make this movie  reccomendable.  The movie also takes some liberties of the main characters  discovery of his sexuality and acceptance which anyone who has had this  struggle relaizes that it isn't that easy.  The one good thing that I  have to say about This movie is the presence of Nicklaus Lange the two main  characters straight friend and his acceptance of their relationship.

Although the plot is predictable, the movie ultimately has a freshness and innocence about it that most of us can find appealing. It is good to know that a straight man can have a gay man as his best friend, that gay people do not have to be hung up on race, that gay men and women can like each other and that parents support their gay children-- at least in the movies.The film was made with not much money; it shows. On the other hand, Hollywood, with the exception of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and a few others, does not usually sink a lot of money into movies with this subject matter.We have come a long distance since BOYS IN THE BAND since these young people ultimately come to terms with their sexuality in a healthy manner.

195284,A30R6HEYBNOJX8,1884190618,J. Edkin,"[88, 89]","""Defying Gravity"" is an earnest, heart-felt movie.  While its edges are rough, both in terms of the performances and the filmmaking, it's these rough edges that actually make the movie feel more real in a way that polished Hollywood acting and production values would undermine.  One could complain that it is yet another coming out story, and in many ways it is, but it's an effective one.Griff (Daniel Chilson) is a college student who lives in a frat house with your typical college guys.  Everyone is assumed to be straight, and the majority of brothers are.  Griff wants to belong, but as a young gay man, he feels a certain amount of isolation.  Because of his wanting to fit in, he remains in the closet despite the efforts of his boyfriend Pete (Don Handfield) to help him come to terms with his identity.  Finally, a crisis forces Griff to take a stand for himself and for Pete.  Yes, anyone who has seen more than a few gay-themed movies or TV shows will have seen this plot.  But it is handled in such an honest and affecting way that you will forgive it.What sets this movie apart are the character relationships.  Griff's interesting relationships with best friend Todd (Niklaus Lange), with Todd's girlfriend Heather (Leslie Tesh), with fellow student Denetra (Linna Carter), and with Pete's father (sorry, I don't recall the actor's name) are what helps us to forgive the cliched elements of the plot.  Of particular note are the relationships with Todd and with Pete's father.  Their reactions to Griff's relationship with Pete are not what you have come to expect from coming out films.  It makes for a refreshing change of pace, and writer/director John Keitel deserves credit for putting new spins on these stock characters.The acting never really rises above college drama student level, but that works for a movie about college students.  Chilson, Lange, Tesh, and Carter all act earnestly and come across as believable college kids in ways that technically-trained performers might not.I do wish that the DVD had more to offer.  The film is in 1.33:1 ration.  I don't know if it has been panned and scanned, a matte removed, or originally shot for a TV screen.  There is no commentary track. I would like to hear Keitel talk about the choices he made as writer and director.  There is a ""pictorial"" soundtrack, meaning that the song's from the film can be accessed and played like a CD while images from the are played like a slideshow.  As there were a couple songs that I particularly liked, I appreciated this feature and found myself wishing other films did the same thing.Overall, it's a solid film and one that I have found myself watching several times.  I recommend it to people who enjoyed ""Get Real"", ""Edge of Seventeen"", ""trick"", ""Broadway Damage"", and ""Torch Song Trilogy.""",4,Worth Seeing,1007424000,"12 4, 2001",2001,2807,"['Defying', 'Gravity', 'earnest', 'heart-felt', 'movie', 'edges', 'are', 'rough', 'terms', 'performances', 'filmmaking', 'rough', 'edges', 'actually', 'make', 'movie', 'feel', 'more', 'real', 'way', 'polished', 'Hollywood', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'would', 'undermine', 'One', 'could', 'complain', 'yet', 'coming', 'out', 'story', 'many', 'ways', 'effective', 'one.Griff', 'Daniel', 'Chilson', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'frat', 'house', 'typical', 'college', 'guys', 'Everyone', 'assumed', 'be', 'straight', 'majority', 'brothers', 'are', 'Griff', 'belong', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'certain', 'amount', 'isolation', 'wanting', 'fit', 'closet', 'efforts', 'boyfriend', 'Pete', 'Don', 'Handfield', 'help', 'come', 'terms', 'identity', 'Finally', 'crisis', 'forces', 'Griff', 'take', 'stand', 'Pete', 'Yes', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'more', 'few', 'gay-themed', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'will', 'have', 'seen', 'plot', 'handled', 'such', 'honest', 'affecting', 'way', 'will', 'forgive', 'it.What', 'movie', 'apart', 'are', 'character', 'relationships', 'Griff', 'interesting', 'relationships', 'best', 'friend', 'Todd', 'Niklaus', 'Lange', 'Todd', 'girlfriend', 'Heather', 'Leslie', 'Tesh', 'fellow', 'student', 'Denetra', 'Linna', 'Carter', 'Pete', 'father', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'actor', 'name', 'are', 'what', 'forgive', 'cliched', 'elements', 'plot', 'particular', 'note', 'are', 'relationships', 'Todd', 'Pete', 'father', 'reactions', 'Griff', 'relationship', 'Pete', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'coming', 'out', 'films', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'writer/director', 'John', 'Keitel', 'credit', 'putting', 'new', 'spins', 'stock', 'characters.The', 'acting', 'never', 'really', 'college', 'drama', 'student', 'level', 'movie', 'college', 'students', 'Chilson', 'Lange', 'Tesh', 'Carter', 'act', 'earnestly', 'come', 'believable', 'college', 'kids', 'ways', 'technically-trained', 'performers', 'might', 'not.I', 'do', 'wish', 'DVD', 'had', 'more', 'offer', 'film', '1.33:1', 'ration', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'been', 'panned', 'scanned', 'matte', 'removed', 'originally', 'shot', 'TV', 'screen', 'commentary', 'track', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'Keitel', 'talk', 'choices', 'made', 'writer', 'director', 'pictorial', 'soundtrack', 'meaning', 'song', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'accessed', 'played', 'CD', 'images', 'are', 'played', 'slideshow', 'were', 'couple', 'songs', 'particularly', 'liked', 'appreciated', 'feature', 'found', 'wishing', 'other', 'films', 'did', 'same', 'thing.Overall', 'solid', 'film', 'one', 'have', 'found', 'watching', 'several', 'times', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Get', 'Real', 'Edge', 'Seventeen', 'trick', 'Broadway', 'Damage', 'Torch', 'Song', 'Trilogy']",N/A

(Snore.)  In the meantime, more provocative and interesting issues are casually brought up and tossed aside: what special pressures do gay fraternity members face? how might a fraternity act when two of its members are outed as lovers? how do you rebuild trust with a closeted partner who fails to cooperate in the investigation when you've been assaulted? what are the similarities and differences in the coming out on campus experience for a white gay man and a black lesbian?  All of these subplots are more compelling than the cliched angst of a self-centered collegiate who runs from taking responsibility for himself, his lover, and their relationship.

Writer-director John Keitel's debut feature  &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; (1997) is an earnest, likeable portrait of  campus life where conformity is the norm and gay students are implicitly  discouraged from finding their true identity. However, the underwritten  script stumbles badly over a number of crucial scenes, which means the  intended dramatic sparks never really ignite, and the performances are  merely OK, but the characters are sympathetic and the narrative still has a  lot of social relevance. Ultimately, the film's heart is in the right place  and it works on its own modest level.Wolfe Video's full-screen (1.33:1)  DVD transfer seems accurate and the colors are vivid, but the sound is a  bit of a mess: The original mono track appears to have been ditched in  favor of two-channel stereo, which would have been fine if the dialogue was  appropriately centered. Instead, everything comes out of the front  left-right channels, making the characters' voices seem disembodied! As  such, it might be best if you listened to it through your TV set rather  than your Dolby/DTS processor.

Griff and Pete are both at very different places emotionally.  Pete is comfortable being gay and he is ready to start living his life to the fullest.  Ironically and tragically, just as Pete makes this life-affirming decision, he receives an unexpected blow.  So it's up to the closeted Griff to re-evaluate his priorities and his assumptions about gay people and gay life.  In the process, he realizes just how much he loves Pete.Daniel Chilson gives an effective performance as the struggling Griff.  He's good at conveying the nervous energy of a closeted gay man.  He goes from being the consummate frat jock to revealing the big heart underneath without altering his personality.  Chilson is an actor who says a lot with his eyes (one scene, where the fraternity brothers are dissing Pete while watching the story of his gay-bashing on the news, is especially moving... you can see Griff's eyes burning with resentment towards his brothers, shame at his own closeted self, and anger and determination to make a change... all without Chilson saying a word).  Nicklaus Lange's performance is a nice surprise as the fraternity brother who accepts Griff and sticks by him during his coming out process.  And Don Handfield is appealing as Pete, and you wish he had more screen time.

The action centers around a fraternity house full of the usual high-testosterone roudiness -- some of  it good-natured, some not. One brother, Griff (Daniel Chilson), is troubled  because he is sleeping with another brother, Pete (Don Handfield), and must  hide the fact. Griff is adamently opposed to being open about their  relationship and describes it as no more than a convenient release. Pete  wants more. Griff tries gamely to alter his attitude, but is defensive and  they argue. He watches his friend walk away. The next morning he learns  that Pete was attacked and severely beaten. Griff is disturbed and feels  responsible, but hasn't the nerve to talk to police. He must do some  soul-searching, and here is the heart of this story. He finds some comfort  in Denetra (Linna Carter), a lovely black student who is also having  trouble coming out. He finds real solace in another brother, Todd (Niklaus  Lange), the heart-warming surprise of the film. Amid the general homophobia  of the house, he is understanding, insightful, loving, and courageous. He  helps Griff confront not only his own homophobia, but those responsible for  Pete's injuries. There is a nice crazy-quilt of story lines which add up to  a lovely, satisfying, unified whole. After all the strife, when Pete and  Griff finally kiss it is a welcome breath of fresh air.

The cast is comprised of plenty of pretty boys who can't really act, and the script seemed a bit meandering and out-of-focus. Griff and Pete hardly had any time on-screen together, and I thought the heart of the film really should have been all about the two of them trying to work out what they expect from their relationship.The basic plot of the film really reminded me of a college-age version of the Alex Sanchez bookThe God Box---a few of the details were very similar. However, while I thought the book was extremely moving, the film didn't have much of an emotional affect on me. Well, there were one or two scenes that were rather touching, but really, in general the film was not nearly as emotionally intense as it could have been. This is because of problems with both the script and the acting.So, overall I'm just going to call this a ""pleasant diversion.""

The story is a good one and shows friendships in situations that aren't always seen in gay films. There are no sex scenes or nudity, and no violence is shown on screen.

In this case, it takes the brutal beating of your secret boyfriend as young college frat guy Grif finds out.  What's a guy to do?  He's at the risk of ruining his lifestyle  and losing his friends yet, the most important person in his life is lying  in a coma and his attackers are still at large.  The only clue is the black  vehicle with the blasting tunes he saw cruising up the same alley Pete was  walking.  Still, as new friend Denetra persuades him, he gradually gets the  courage to face the police, Pete's parents and his friends by giving the  cops some vital info on who nearly killed Pete.  This terrific independent  film has a lot going for it:  attractive cast, good acting from the leads  (Don Handfield, in particular, is smart and confident as Pete and Daniel  Chilson - kind of like a cross between Richard Gere and Maxwell Caulfield -  has a believable innocence), good music score - in fact, it's got more than  most Hollywood romantic offerings (Here on Earth, for example). What struck  me most, however, were the quiet moments in the film - There's a feeling of  content between Pete and Grif as they sit in a tree staring into each  others' eyes...out of sight from the maddening college crowds. Last year,  this was one of a handful of films (like Edge of Seventeen, Get Real,  Trick, Broadway Damage) aimed toward gay audiences that really had a  positive impact.

In the end the love outweighs all of Griff's fears and Griff does the right things.The movie isn't so much about Griff's struggle to figure out what to do about the information he knows about the gay bashing...the movie is about love conquering all.
