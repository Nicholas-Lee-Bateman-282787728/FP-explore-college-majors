I will update it if there are any changes from the VHS.THE STORY: In the 1870's, an Indian brave named White Bull (played by Sal Mineo) catches a stallion and names him Tonka. White Bull's more powerful cousin Yellow Bull is jealous and takes his horse away, but then abuses the horse. White Bull frees the horse, who eventually is owned by a U.S. Calvary Captain. The captain rides him into the battle with General Custer, where he is killed by the cousin Yellow Bull of all people, but the horse gets finally gets his chance at revenge. Tonka is retired by the Calvary as the only survivor and hero of the battle of the Little Big Horn. White Bull joins the cavalry, and is the only person allowed to ride Tonka as his exercise groom. ""Tonka Wakan"" means the Great One.BEHIND THE SCENES: The movie has a running time of 97 minutes in its VHS release. Originally conceived as a 5 episode television series, Walt Disney decided to use the material for a theatrical release instead. The movie premiered on December 25, 1958. It was directed by one of the ""Zorro"" show directors, Lewis R. Foster. He also took on the job of writer (Along with Lillie Hayward). Disney was one of the few studios where writers were often allowed to direct or produce their work. The screenplay was based on the book ""Comanche"" by David Appel. On location filming took place at the ""Warm Springs Indian Reservation"" in Oregon, where local residents worked as extras and crew. The director utilized the talents of cinematographer Loyal Griggs, famous for his work in western films such as ""Shane"". The scenery in the movie is stunning, with wide vistas in Technicolor.Long time Disney studio composer George Bruns wrote the song ""Tonka"" with Gil George, and another studio veteran wrote the background score, Oliver Wallace. The film returned to its original conception in a way when it was re-edited into a two episode film for Disney's weekly television show, the first episode titled ""The Captive Stallion"", and second was titled ""The Lone Survivor of Custer's Last Stand"". It began airing on NBC's ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show on February 18, and 25, 1962, and as a repeat on April 17, 24, 1966, and again on August 29, September 5, 1971. In 1977, Disney decided to air the film as a TV special on January 29, 1977, under the new name ""A Horse Called Comanche"". It was also edited under that title for serialization for ""The New Mickey Mouse Club"". The original film is what finally appeared on VHS in 1986. Looking forward to DVD release, and glad they are taking it off the shelf.",5,Tonka Wakan means the Great One,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,2675,"['review', 'VHS', 'story', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'are', 'awaiting', 'DVD', 'release', 'will', 'update', 'are', 'changes', 'VHS.THE', 'STORY', '1870', 'Indian', 'brave', 'named', 'White', 'Bull', 'played', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'stallion', 'names', 'Tonka', 'White', 'Bull', 'more', 'powerful', 'cousin', 'Yellow', 'Bull', 'jealous', 'horse', 'away', 'then', 'horse', 'White', 'Bull', 'horse', 'who', 'eventually', 'owned', 'U.S.', 'Calvary', 'Captain', 'captain', 'battle', 'General', 'Custer', 'where', 'killed', 'cousin', 'Yellow', 'Bull', 'people', 'horse', 'finally', 'chance', 'revenge', 'Tonka', 'retired', 'Calvary', 'only', 'survivor', 'hero', 'battle', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'White', 'Bull', 'cavalry', 'only', 'person', 'allowed', 'ride', 'Tonka', 'exercise', 'groom', 'Tonka', 'Wakan', 'Great', 'One.BEHIND', 'THE', 'SCENES', 'movie', 'running', 'time', '97', 'minutes', 'VHS', 'release', 'Originally', 'conceived', '5', 'episode', 'television', 'series', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'decided', 'use', 'material', 'theatrical', 'release', 'instead', 'movie', 'premiered', 'December', '25', '1958', 'was', 'directed', 'one', 'Zorro', 'show', 'directors', 'Lewis', 'R.', 'Foster', 'also', 'took', 'job', 'writer', 'Lillie', 'Hayward', 'Disney', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'studios', 'where', 'writers', 'were', 'often', 'allowed', 'direct', 'produce', 'work', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'Comanche', 'David', 'Appel', 'location', 'filming', 'took', 'place', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'Indian', 'Reservation', 'Oregon', 'where', 'local', 'residents', 'worked', 'extras', 'crew', 'director', 'utilized', 'talents', 'cinematographer', 'Loyal', 'Griggs', 'famous', 'work', 'western', 'films', 'such', 'Shane', 'scenery', 'movie', 'stunning', 'wide', 'vistas', 'Technicolor.Long', 'time', 'Disney', 'studio', 'composer', 'George', 'Bruns', 'wrote', 'song', 'Tonka', 'Gil', 'George', 'studio', 'veteran', 'wrote', 'background', 'score', 'Oliver', 'Wallace', 'film', 'returned', 'original', 'conception', 'way', 'when', 'was', 're-edited', 'two', 'episode', 'film', 'Disney', 'weekly', 'television', 'show', 'first', 'episode', 'titled', 'Captive', 'Stallion', 'second', 'was', 'titled', 'Lone', 'Survivor', 'Custer', 'Last', 'Stand', 'began', 'airing', 'NBC', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'television', 'show', 'February', '18', '25', '1962', 'repeat', 'April', '17', '24', '1966', 'again', 'August', '29', 'September', '5', '1971', '1977', 'Disney', 'decided', 'air', 'film', 'TV', 'special', 'January', '29', '1977', 'new', 'name', 'Horse', 'Called', 'Comanche', 'was', 'also', 'edited', 'title', 'serialization', 'New', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'original', 'film', 'what', 'finally', 'appeared', 'VHS', '1986', 'Looking', 'forward', 'DVD', 'release', 'glad', 'are', 'taking', 'off', 'shelf']",N/A
