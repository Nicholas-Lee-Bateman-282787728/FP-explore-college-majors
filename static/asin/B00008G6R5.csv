I had my 25 year old daughter who takes ballet classes watch. Her first comment was, ""They have a bulge beneath their tutu. Ballet is supposed to create straight lines & grace."" She then stated, ""You wouldn't think they would be that good."" It is true you never mistake them for women till you see a wide shot & you may forget who is dancing.The dancer's, costumes, choreography & individual personalities involved in this are on display & first rate. If you like the unusual you'll love this but you'll probably get a kick out of it even if the unusual isn't normally for you. One sign of emerging talent is the product gets better over time. Volume 2 displays a maturing of dance but is at least as outrageous as Volume 1 & I think it is more so. This show & 2 are colorful, funny, cute & well performed. Afterwards I was struck by the amount of money that was risked to begin this troupe.

M WILINSKY,"[25, 26]","If you are looking for something a little different in ballet, you should try this.  the Trockadero troupe offers comedy, men dancing on pointe as women, and men dancing as men.(unfortunately, they do not offer men dancing on pointe as men, which has been explored by others, nor do they explore women dancing as men.)  They are very entertaining and dance quite well, showing a serious side in addition to the comedy.  The company director points out that they also make it a point ( a pointe? ) to do unusual pieces, not done much by other companies, such as ""Raymonda's Wedding"" in volume one and ""Yes Virginia, Another Piano Ballet"" in volume two (volume two is also available through amazon.com ).  As a male ballet dancer myself, the differences in what makes movement masculine or feminine is something I and all serious dancers explore; perhaps this troupe helps shed some light on this.  The overall emphasis here is comedy, not any heavy message, so this dvd should appeal to a wide audience.",5,men on pointe and more!,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",2004,1002,"['are', 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'ballet', 'should', 'try', 'Trockadero', 'troupe', 'offers', 'comedy', 'men', 'dancing', 'pointe', 'women', 'men', 'dancing', 'men', 'unfortunately', 'do', 'not', 'offer', 'men', 'dancing', 'pointe', 'men', 'been', 'explored', 'others', 'do', 'explore', 'women', 'dancing', 'men', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'dance', 'quite', 'well', 'showing', 'serious', 'side', 'addition', 'comedy', 'company', 'director', 'points', 'out', 'also', 'make', 'point', 'pointe', 'do', 'unusual', 'pieces', 'not', 'done', 'much', 'other', 'companies', 'such', 'Raymonda', 'Wedding', 'volume', 'one', 'Yes', 'Virginia', 'Piano', 'Ballet', 'volume', 'two', 'volume', 'two', 'also', 'available', 'amazon.com', 'male', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'differences', 'what', 'movement', 'masculine', 'feminine', 'something', 'serious', 'dancers', 'explore', 'perhaps', 'troupe', 'shed', 'light', 'overall', 'emphasis', 'here', 'comedy', 'not', 'heavy', 'message', 'dvd', 'should', 'appeal', 'wide', 'audience']","Les Ballets Trockadero, Vol. 1: Swan Lake/Le Corsair/Go for Barocco/The Dying Swan/Raymonda's Wedding"
741692,A8X8D4BUY5DFU,B00008G6R5,Joseph M. Seda,"[0, 1]","A new look to traditional Ballet favorites, with all parts danced by men, many in drag, and with satire thrown in. Fun, but probably not for traditionalists or homophobes. It was amazing how feminine they could look as long you as you did not get close enough to see their beards and deliberately overdone makeup. They also seemed to have picked the ugliest guys to dance the female romantic leads. I think someone really enjoyed ""putting on"" this production.",5,Amusing way to look at Ballet,1220572800,"09 5, 2008",2008,459,"['new', 'look', 'traditional', 'Ballet', 'favorites', 'parts', 'danced', 'men', 'many', 'drag', 'satire', 'thrown', 'Fun', 'probably', 'not', 'traditionalists', 'homophobes', 'was', 'amazing', 'how', 'feminine', 'could', 'look', 'long', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'close', 'enough', 'see', 'beards', 'deliberately', 'overdone', 'makeup', 'also', 'seemed', 'have', 'picked', 'ugliest', 'guys', 'dance', 'female', 'romantic', 'leads', 'think', 'someone', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'putting', 'production']","Les Ballets Trockadero, Vol. 1: Swan Lake/Le Corsair/Go for Barocco/The Dying Swan/Raymonda's Wedding"
741693,AUZ460FTPQRNQ,B00008G6R5,"ladycplum ""Severe Rickmaniac""","[7, 7]","What amazes me the most about the Trocks is the fact that some of them outstrip their ""female"" counterparts on several levels. Robert Carter can out fouette any woman I have ever seen, and he brings across the classic diva attitude in every performace. Carlos Garcia plays up the ""I'm just too adorable for my own good"" ballerina, Jai Williams is always so dainty, wearing the taped-together glasses for every big show-stopper and Paul Ghiselin is the perfect Trock-he can dance, and he has the facial and body expressions to seriously make the comedy aspects work.Ken Busbin and Fernando Medina are two of the dancers I always felt dance better in their respective gender roles. Ken was amazing as Siegfried in Swan Lake, and Fernando has the athleticism of a Russian gymnast. His barrel turns and scissor jumps in Le Corsaire put any male dancer in the Kirov to shame.But I kneel at the feet of Bernd Burgmaier. He is impossibly tall, he has impeccable technique, his beautiful arabesques make me, as a former dancer, INSANELY jealous, not to mention he just might be the most adorable creature on the planet. I think I just might be developing a crush, granted, of the very very very VERY non-requitted variety :)",5,Can never get enough!,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,1216,"['What', 'most', 'Trocks', 'fact', 'outstrip', 'female', 'counterparts', 'several', 'levels', 'Robert', 'Carter', 'can', 'out', 'fouette', 'woman', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'classic', 'diva', 'attitude', 'performace', 'Carlos', 'Garcia', 'up', ""'m"", 'just', 'too', 'adorable', 'own', 'good', 'ballerina', 'Jai', 'Williams', 'always', 'so', 'dainty', 'wearing', 'taped-together', 'glasses', 'big', 'show-stopper', 'Paul', 'Ghiselin', 'perfect', 'Trock-he', 'can', 'dance', 'facial', 'body', 'expressions', 'seriously', 'make', 'comedy', 'work.Ken', 'Busbin', 'Fernando', 'Medina', 'are', 'two', 'dancers', 'always', 'felt', 'dance', 'better', 'respective', 'gender', 'roles', 'Ken', 'was', 'amazing', 'Siegfried', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'Fernando', 'athleticism', 'Russian', 'gymnast', 'barrel', 'turns', 'scissor', 'jumps', 'Le', 'Corsaire', 'put', 'male', 'dancer', 'Kirov', 'shame.But', 'kneel', 'feet', 'Bernd', 'Burgmaier', 'impossibly', 'tall', 'impeccable', 'technique', 'beautiful', 'arabesques', 'make', 'former', 'dancer', 'INSANELY', 'jealous', 'not', 'mention', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'adorable', 'creature', 'planet', 'think', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'developing', 'crush', 'granted', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'VERY', 'non-requitted', 'variety']","Les Ballets Trockadero, Vol. 1: Swan Lake/Le Corsair/Go for Barocco/The Dying Swan/Raymonda's Wedding"
