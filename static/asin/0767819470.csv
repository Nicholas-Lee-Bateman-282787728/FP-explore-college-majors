Being English myself, I thought a lot of the comedy and dialogue might not translate well to a mainstream audience, but you can't beat a good old fashioned story. Simple plot - A World famous rock band of the 70's split acrimoniously, and through a chance meeting with the son of a former promoter have the chance to get back together. A veritable A list of UK TV stars are here, and the team of Ian La Frenais & Dick Clement (Lovejoy, Auf Wiedersehn Pet) writing ensure quality. Billed as a riotous comedy is a bit wide of the mark, as there is a great deal of depth to the story, and the characters. At times hilarious, often bittersweet, but always realistic in it's portrayal of life, love, missed opportunities, and a wanting to relive ones past - this is really polished. As someone who can remember the 70's this struck a chord or two with me, and I would doubt it would have as good an impact on a younger audience, but don't let that put anyone off - a real ""feel good"" picture, cleverly interwoven with a quiet grace, and melencholy air would be the poets description.

The film is lorded over by supposed lesser-light Bill Nighy, portraying the David Lee Roth-like, completely self-absorbed lead singer 'Ray Simms.'  Try taking your eyes off Nighy when he's on the screen...especially during his spleen-venting histrionics on-stage.

That's exactly the way the movie feels.We rented 'Still Crazy' as a 'second movie' throw-in & wound up being totally enchanted by it.

15141,A2QA095LQPDBJD,0767819470,Ariel Escasa,"[1, 1]","The decade of the 90's saw the re-emergence of several rock bands of the 70's. Deep Purple, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Black Sabbath, Yes (the classic lineup), and The Doobie Brothers, among others, all came back loud and proud as ever, much to the delight of those of us who grew up during their heyday.So it was only natural, and also much to our delight, that a movie about such a band was made. Strange Fruit, actually a fictitious rock group, could very well have been a real-life band. All the requisite elements are here: the member who meets an untimely death by drug overdose (were you expecting a sky-diving accident?), the guitarist who mysteriously disappears, the artistic differences, and the internal bickering that eventually leads to the group's breakup. Not to mention the long hair, the denim jeans and jackets, and of couse, the music.Not surprisingly, the personality clashes that led to Strange Fruit's demise in the 70's resurface during the reunion phase, threatening to again tear the band apart. Art imitates life once again here, as this situation is reminiscent of the problems that beset Deep Purple, specifically guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and vocalist Ian Gillan, during the 70's and again after their reunion in the 90's.As we watch the Fruits go through the difficult times once again, we react with genuine involvement and concern, hoping they will pull through, but at the same time wondering if the years have made them mature enough to handle the situation.Admittedly, this film's appeal is far from universal. If you like rock music, if you are or were the type to not just listen to your favorite bands but also read about them in Rolling Stone, if you rejoiced in the comebacks of the great rock acts of the 70's, and most of all, if you hate disco, this is one movie you will definitely enjoy.",4,Art Imitates Life: 70's Rock Band Reunites,1061596800,"08 23, 2003",2003,1831,"['decade', '90', 'saw', 're-emergence', 'several', 'rock', 'bands', '70', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'Yes', 'classic', 'lineup', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'others', 'came', 'back', 'loud', 'proud', 'ever', 'much', 'delight', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'heyday.So', 'was', 'only', 'natural', 'also', 'much', 'delight', 'movie', 'band', 'was', 'made', 'Strange', 'Fruit', 'actually', 'fictitious', 'rock', 'group', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'real-life', 'band', 'requisite', 'elements', 'are', 'here', 'member', 'who', 'untimely', 'death', 'drug', 'overdose', 'were', 'expecting', 'sky-diving', 'accident', 'guitarist', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'artistic', 'differences', 'internal', 'bickering', 'eventually', 'group', 'breakup', 'Not', 'mention', 'long', 'hair', 'denim', 'jeans', 'jackets', 'couse', 'music.Not', 'surprisingly', 'personality', 'led', 'Strange', 'Fruit', 'demise', '70', 'resurface', 'reunion', 'phase', 'threatening', 'again', 'tear', 'band', 'apart', 'Art', 'life', 'once', 'again', 'here', 'situation', 'reminiscent', 'problems', 'beset', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'specifically', 'guitarist', 'Ritchie', 'Blackmore', 'vocalist', 'Ian', 'Gillan', '70', 'again', 'reunion', ""90's.As"", 'watch', 'Fruits', 'go', 'difficult', 'times', 'once', 'again', 'react', 'genuine', 'involvement', 'concern', 'hoping', 'will', 'pull', 'same', 'time', 'wondering', 'years', 'have', 'made', 'mature', 'enough', 'handle', 'situation.Admittedly', 'film', 'appeal', 'far', 'universal', 'like', 'rock', 'music', 'are', 'were', 'type', 'not', 'just', 'listen', 'favorite', 'bands', 'also', 'read', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'rejoiced', 'comebacks', 'great', 'rock', 'acts', '70', 'most', 'hate', 'disco', 'one', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy']",N/A
15142,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,0767819470,audrey,"[0, 0]","This movie is quite entertaining.  It has a great cast and none of the performers are wasted: Stephen Rea is the sweet guy who wants the band to take advantage of a reunion and achieve the success that internal bickering and problems cost them years ago; Billy Connolly is a hoot as the band's pragmatic roadie; Bill Nighy captures dim-witted preening lead singer Ray without making him unsympathetic; Timothy Spall brings laughs as the drummer still living in the past ('If women are from Venus and men are from Mars, drummers are from Pluto'); Jimmy Nail is the guitarist with grudges, regrets and a nice voice; and Juliet Aubrey is engaging as the woman who was a fan/runner and steps in as manager for the group.  Though the two younger supporting roles aren't given much to do, that leaves more screen time for the adult characters, each of whom is three-dimensional, sympathetic and interesting.  Billy Connolly's voiceovers are well-written and fun, and while not every joke works, there are many one-liners that you will make you laugh the next day.You can see bits of your favorite 70s bands paid tribute, from Pink Floyd to Deep Purple, with insight and affection and the songs, written by veterans of Foreigner and Squeeze, are quite good.  The film is very funny for the first half and then takes a few missteps as the drama quotient is elevated, but it finds its way again before the close.

Both of the approaches work for each film (though Spinal Tap is the classic and Still Crazy is just a really good movie)""Crazy"" tells the story of Strange Fruit, a 70's british rock band (think Foreigner with a dash of King Crimson) attempting a comeback tour twenty years after their beloved lead member suddenly dies.The band members have various reasons for coming back ( a gentle skewering of has been musicians) and start out playing clubs they have played in their younger days as a prelude to their surprise appearance at a major british rock festival.Bill Nighy is hilarious in a performance that could be seen as a prelude to his similar role in ""Love Actually"". Billy Connoly is also great as the band's old roadie.

I always liked Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap, but after discovering this seldom heard of little jem a few years back, this is my favorite fictional work about a band.  Strange Fruit live up to their name tenfold.  They exemplify every once great 70s band (well, in their case, near great) that fell apart due to egos, drugs, death, and all the other trappings that come with any modicum of success.20 years later, desperate for cash and all lost in their own ways, they reunite to play clubs in Europe so they can headline once again at the very place where they split up.  This movie is sensitive and funny, bypassing some of the direct meanness of Tap, and you actually come to care for each of these characters.  Stephen Rea is always great in every movie I've seen him in, but here he is more or less the keyboard playing glue that keeps the band together.  Timothy Spall is hilarious as Beano, sarcastic, flatulent, and idiotic by turns.  Jimmy Nail as Les is particularly grabbing in his jealousy as he is bypassed for another singer after the original, Keith Lovell, died of an overdose.  It's been said before, but it must be said again:  Bill Nighy as insecure, aging, dopey and lovable lead vocalist Ray Simms steals every single scene he's in.  Hell, he does that in EVERY movie I've seen him in, and that is a definite compliment.  He also has a pretty great singing voice to boot.Songs are penned by Foreigner's Mick Jones and Squeeze's Chris Difford for a great and fitting soundtrack.  This movie is fun, moving, and it will make you glad you appreciate classic rock even more than you may right now.  With obvious nods to British greats like Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, and Pink Floyd with a strong resemblance to Syd Barrett in Brian Lovell's case, there's not much you can't love about this flick.  We're all getting older, so it's that much more endearing, and we can definitely relate.  Our rockers got old with us, and this movie captures that in the best and uplifting of all lights.  Put this one in your DVD player and enjoy.  No matter how many times you watch it, you may find that the flame still burns.",5,"""I'm Not Fifty!""

Here, however, the interest is less in ridiculing preposterous figures - although some of the things their singer does are conventionally silly - than fondly celebrating the desires of middle-age.  When we first see our aging heroes, they are working a variety of unglamorous, 'ordinary' jobs.  Unlike 'Spinal Tap', there is little attention to believable detail in this film, to the processes of the music industry, to the wiles of the people running and peopling it, to the alien-like removal from reality of its stars.  There are various flashbacks to the band's skinny, youthful selves, but we don't believe for a moment that these pretty young men have any connection to the shabby slobs who have now, pod-like, taken over their names.  These men are like any of their middle-aged ilk who reach a certain point of their life, see where they've ended up, a million miles from their teenage dreams and desires, and try to live them out before it's too late (a kind of rock 'City Slickers' if you will).  Looked at this way, the film has more pathos than as a study of once-great superstars, or a satire of the music industry.This doesn't mean there's any great depth to the characters - each is given a particular quality which is only minimally modified as the plot treads its predictable path.  The bland trawl through various good-looking Euro-locations doesn't give them the rootedness or context they need (although this, admittedly, is a theme).  The film's writers are a legendary British sitcom partnership, and the best scenes are those bantering and slanging sequences in interior, TV-friendly spaces such as pubs, buses or dressing rooms.

15160,A356RFKNIG043B,0767819470,K. Swanson,"[0, 3]","This movie is but a pale imitation of Spinal Tap, and nowhere near as funny.I found it at the library, never having heard of it, and watched it expecting a lot more than I got (the price was right, though). Connolly, Rea, Nighy and the rest are decent enough, and the script has some good lines, but very few compared to Tap, which is its obvious touchstone...and ten times the movie this is.The main problem is the laughably mediocre music. Rather than play for laughs, as Guest and friends wisely did, SC attempts to show that these guys were once really good. But guess what? Writing memorably good rock songs is a LOT harder than writing memorably bad ones. It's hard to believe Chris Difford co-wrote most of these; he should have called on his old Squeeze mate Tilbrook for help, as they could write together. His tunes here with Mick Jones of Foreigner sound like the pablum that band often dished up, but worse. There's not one decent tune in the bunch, by my estimation. They all just sound like typically hackneyed halfassed rock tunes. Add a Jeanine take-off, a few other Tap ideas such as Stonehenge moments and a botched back-to-the-prog-days show and you've got a movie that's trying to be Tap but comes nowhere near.Ever heard of Status Quo? They're another template for this movie, and their one big hit, Rockin' All Over The World (which John Fogerty wrote), is the obvious model for Strange Fruit's All Over The World...except that their tune ain't even half memorable. Timothy Spall, so so funny in Vacuuming Completely Nude In Paradise, is wasted here, stuck in the background and given little chance to shine. Nighy is humorous at moments, as is Connolly, but not once did I laugh out loud, as opposed to Tap, where after 20 viewings I still crack up.I played rock music for a living for most of the 90s, so I'm well ready to laugh at the genre, its players, and its fans. But perhaps that's why I didn't dig this much. It's neither a proper send-up nor very realistic, and falls into the meh middle. It's well made, shot decently and put together competently, but the music is just so weak while trying to be somewhat good that it all fell apart for me.Now I'll get attacked by the fanboys, but all I can say is that this is to Spinal Tap as Status Quo is to Led Zeppelin.And by the way, Strange Fruit is a weak choice of name, considering it's the title of one of the most moving popular songs ever sung, and it's about lynched American blacks hanging from trees; Billie Holiday's version is magnificent. Hardly the right assocaitaion for a funny name...but then, there's plenty of jokes that don't really work here. Thinking of that song while watching this only reinforced my feeling that, while those who made this had their hearts in the right place, they screwed up by trying to write good songs, and failing.

Overall, great acting. The movie's music is very good and Once the band gets back in their groove the music track becomes outstanding.The one sub-plot of the movie that should have been omitted is the crazed groupie chasing after the drummer.

And, to top it off Bill Nighy!'Still Crazy' is a film that brings us back to the 70's. A group of men and the woman who was the manager, get back together thinking they can create the days of yore and resurrect the band 'Strange Fruit'. This name describes the group- all strange in some ways. The twenty years since the group broke up, did not bring much success to any of the group. One is a roofing contractor, one lives in a trailer in his mother's garden and hides from the tax man, one services condom machines, and even the one who keot his money, spent most of it and his mansion is up for sale. None of them remember the old days with affection. Jealousy, anger and betrayal among them, and drugs and lifestyle didn't help. Stephen Rea, Bill Nighy, and Billy Connolly are the known members of the band. The Strange Fruit agree to do a tour of Holland. They need the money. But they are all older and they can't conceal how bad they look.Nighy makes the best impression. He conveys a kind of fear when he knows he can't trust himself to do the right thing. Without him, this film would not register, at all, another film of a failed rock band, but he brings this film and the characters to life.

The only thing these films have in common is that they are about a band and they both have good music. Outside of that I don't see any comparison. Spinal Tap is a great film on it's own, sort of a metal parody of ""A Hard Day Night"" or ""mockumentary"". ""Still Crazy"" is not another Spinal Tap, it has an actual plot with strong emotional characters that develope and grow as you watch the movie. You actually feel a real connection to these characters as they try to exorcize the ghosts of their past and see if they can possibly get back the spirit of the music they once shared. (One other reviewer said that Still Crazy could be compared to the real life ""Story of Anvil"" that came out 10 years later and I totally agree.) If you are looking for a steady stream rock jokes, you will be disappointed. This movie is not a series of one liners, it is funny because the story itself and the situations are funny.The difference between Still Crazy and Spinal Tap can also be demonstrated by the music in each film. Spinal Tap's comedy goes all the way, even to the song lyrics and metal clich&eacute;s but Spinal taps ""Big Bottom"" or ""Sex Farm Woman"" could never have been real radio hits in any era and were created to be funny (and they are). On the other hand Strange Fruits ""All Over The World"" or ""The Flame Still Burns"" are serious songs that seem like they are real rock anthems that could have actually been hits in an earlier era.

The &quot;Ray&quot; character is  sympathetic and hilarious at the same time...a wonderful character.The  performances are outstanding, the comedy sometimes subtle, sometimes broad,  and the music is awesome (I own the soundtrack and would highly recommend  it to anyone, even people who haven't seen the movie).My wife and I  watched the movie 3 times in one month...that's how much we enjoyed  it.So, when's Strange Fruit coming to town!",5,My favorite video of 1999,947635200,"01 12, 2000",2000,742,"['Favorite', 'movie', '1999', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Favorite', 'video', 'rental', '1999', 'Still', 'Crazy.This', 'movie', 'pure', 'joy', 'not', 'quot', 'mockumentary', 'quot', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'rather', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'comedy', '60s/70s', 'British', 'rock', 'band', 'trying', 'make', 'comeback', 'quot', 'Ray', 'quot', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'hilarious', 'same', 'time', 'wonderful', 'character.The', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'comedy', 'sometimes', 'subtle', 'sometimes', 'broad', 'music', 'awesome', 'own', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', '.My', 'wife', 'watched', 'movie', '3', 'times', 'one', 'month', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'it.So', 'when', 'Strange', 'Fruit', 'coming', 'town']",N/A

15170,A3943KDQAJM85A,0767819470,Snow White,"[3, 3]","In a similar spirit of the classic faux-rockumentary This is Spinal Tap, Still Crazy weaves a tale of has-been musicians attempting to give their rock band,'Strange Fruit' a last shot at fame.Not only do they have to relearn their love of the music, but remember how to deal with each other and the same dramas they faced decades before. Besides that there is a whole mess of egos in a small bus, the egocentric lead singer who can't see that he's no longer a star, the heavily burdened keyboard player who's always been in love with the guitar player's girl, and the bass player who still can't forgive anyone for blowing his chance of being the lead singer.I personally didn't know what to expect(it's hard to hold a candle to Spinal Tap) but  Still Crazy maintains the perfect balance of adding humor to the situation while still treating each character with great respect. (And I must say, it's fantastic to see the 'girlfriend/groupie/band-aid' female character as an empowered woman, for just once.)Joking aside, the music suits the film beautifully and can stand alone as well.I ended up crying(only a few tears) during their big performance and actually found myself truly caring for these five guys, and hoping that they really could be rockstars once again.",5,"""I didn't feel like it was happening tonight.""",1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,1267,"['similar', 'spirit', 'classic', 'faux-rockumentary', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Still', 'Crazy', 'tale', 'has-been', 'musicians', 'attempting', 'give', 'rock', 'band', 'Fruit', 'last', 'shot', 'fame.Not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'relearn', 'love', 'music', 'remember', 'how', 'deal', 'other', 'same', 'dramas', 'faced', 'decades', 'whole', 'mess', 'egos', 'small', 'bus', 'egocentric', 'lead', 'singer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'no', 'longer', 'star', 'heavily', 'burdened', 'keyboard', 'player', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'love', 'guitar', 'player', 'girl', 'bass', 'player', 'who', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'anyone', 'blowing', 'chance', 'being', 'lead', 'singer.I', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'hard', 'hold', 'candle', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Still', 'Crazy', 'perfect', 'balance', 'adding', 'humor', 'situation', 'still', 'treating', 'character', 'great', 'respect', 'must', 'say', 'fantastic', 'see', ""'girlfriend/groupie/band-aid"", 'female', 'character', 'empowered', 'woman', 'just', 'once', 'Joking', 'aside', 'music', 'suits', 'film', 'beautifully', 'can', 'stand', 'alone', 'well.I', 'ended', 'up', 'crying', 'only', 'few', 'tears', 'big', 'performance', 'actually', 'found', 'truly', 'caring', 'five', 'guys', 'hoping', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'rockstars', 'once', 'again']",N/A

It's about a 70s rock band that reunites 20 years later for a tour and a chance to make it big again.  Unfortunately, the demons of the past haven't gone away.  The problems and rivalries that led to the band's breakup are still there, but this is their second chance not only for their career but to right the wrongs as well.Not only is this movie very funny, but it's quite touching as well.  It's less about the rock and roll lifestyle and more about getting older.  You end up really caring about these characters.  You want to see them work out their grudges and you want to see them succeed.  Everybody here does a fine job, but it's Bill Nighy that really steals the show.  He plays the vocalist who never thought he was ever accepted by the band, and has turned in a life of sex and drinking for a wife, AA meeting, spirituality and Evian.  He's a stuttering goofball that still seems to be stuck in rock star mode.  Kinda like Ozzy Osbourne only intelligent and likable.  This was before Nighy was very well known, so he's buried way down in the credits, but he comes across as more of the star of the film than Stephen Rea or Billy Connolly.Sure the movie may not be for everyone.  It does get a bit sappy and heavy on the emotion at the end, but it works.

Still Crazy is a well conceived and executed movie, that I can watch over and over again.The casting was simply flawless with Spall, Connolly, Rea and Nail all giving 1000%, as the band. The only curious piece of casting was Juliet Aubrey. Don't get me wrong, she's a superb actress and a goddess into the bargain, but she was cast as a woman who was supposed to be at least in her early forties, whereas she was only about 29 when the movie was made. Still, she carries it off, as did Helena and the boys, and with a superb collection of seventies-sounding songs, the band are totally believable, both on and off the stage.As for band politics and conflicts... been there, done that, so I know how bang-on this all is.One of the best movies I have ever seen.",5,Break like the wind...,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,1042,"['Naw', 'Still', 'Crazy', 'little', 'more', 'serious', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'magical', 'movie', 'shortage', 'humor', 'throughout.I', ""'d"", 'followed', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'revelation', 'rock', 'singer', 'right', 'down', 'having', 'decent', 'voice', 'as', 'well', 'exceptional', 'stagecraft', 'Still', 'Crazy', 'well', 'conceived', 'executed', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'again.The', 'casting', 'was', 'simply', 'flawless', 'Spall', 'Connolly', 'Rea', 'Nail', 'giving', '1000', '%', 'band', 'only', 'curious', 'piece', 'casting', 'was', 'Juliet', 'Aubrey', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'superb', 'actress', 'goddess', 'bargain', 'was', 'cast', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'least', 'early', 'forties', 'was', 'only', 'about', '29', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Still', 'off', 'did', 'Helena', 'boys', 'superb', 'collection', 'seventies-sounding', 'songs', 'band', 'are', 'totally', 'believable', 'stage.As', 'band', 'politics', 'conflicts', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'know', 'how', 'bang-on', 'is.One', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

I knew guys just like the characters and those girls who lost love and lovers to drugs, alcohol, and, well...reality!  The comedy is poignant and a little heart-breaking.  While a sequel is probably out of the question, you may sometimes wonder what the boys and Karen would be up to.  Okay, it's a movie.  Well, wouldn't you like an update?

I thought what the heck, this can't be to bad.  Besides, it was nominated for a golden globe, how did I miss it.  Well, that is a good question.  This is a movie that just wasn't promoted, and for once the awards shows were correct in nominating it, it is a great flick. The story evolves around a fictional 70's rock group named Strange Fruit, a group that had ups and downs because of drugs and inner turmoil.  Their lead singer Kieth died from overdose and his replacement never felt ""in the group"", which is true because the other member often brought up demons of the past.  Brian, lead guitar and brother to Kieth, was also headed down the same path.  The group was destroyed at a festival in the late seventies on the verge of superstardom when lighting struck the festival stage they were on. And with one zap, the band disbanded. Now fast forward 20 years, the guys have moved on, but one member, their keyboardist, has not.  Dumb luck he meets a festival organizer, the son of the organizer of their last festival 20 years ago, who wants to have a reunion festival.  This sparks our keyboardist mind to form a reunion.  the movie takes off and follows the trials of this group being put back together and attempting to make a go of it. Although this time it's tougher, Brian the guitarman is not found, and from the looks of thing and evidence at hand, died years ago quietly.  Even with the hireing of a young guitar wizard, will the band pull this reunion off...you just have to watch.  An outstanding movie, Not just a knock off of Spinal tap, and A couple of years before the movie Rock Star (which seems similar to real Life Judas Priest history).  This movie is outstanding for any music fan, a must see.  And check out the soundtrack as well, some cool 70's era singers and musicians put together a spectacular piece of work that sounds new, but with that retro edge, really cool.
