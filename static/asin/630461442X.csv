429844,A1PASRZ81DY9C,630461442X,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 5/13Rate: 75/13: Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis team together for the first of two films: Too Young to Die? The other one, Kalifornia, is more of the same but a lot more pathetic and redundant. Although Juliette shows off her good acting abilities, she can be amateurish when she throws a temper tantrum. It's almost like as if I am supposed to be sympathetic to her character's problems. Similarly, in the end, the director tries to create more sympathy for the teenagers on death row. I thought that the numbers portrayed were too low. It should have been more than that. My only problem with the death penalty process is that the appeals take too long to process. Here lies a dilemma with Brad Pitt: do you want to be with him despite the fact that he supplies you with drugs including heroin and ecstacy and lands you in the death row? But come on...it's Brad Pitt, for Pete's sake. All in all, Too Young to Die? is a lot like a Lifetime Movie of the Week, and it is an enjoyable one. By the way, the film is based on the actions of Attina Cannaday and David Gray. Her death penalty was reversed, and her sentence was commuted to life. In 2008, she was set free from prison through parole. Gray remains in prison for life. As far as the facts of the case are, the movie is a fake. As you know, there is no such thing as the gas chamber in the state of Oklahoma.",4,"Fake Story, But Brad Pitt Cares About You Though.",1367452800,"05 2, 2013",2013,1371,"['Viewed', '5/13Rate', '75/13', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'team', 'together', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Too', 'Young', 'Die', 'other', 'one', 'Kalifornia', 'more', 'same', 'lot', 'more', 'pathetic', 'redundant', 'Juliette', 'good', 'acting', 'abilities', 'can', 'be', 'amateurish', 'when', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'almost', 'am', 'supposed', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'problems', 'Similarly', 'end', 'director', 'create', 'more', 'sympathy', 'teenagers', 'death', 'row', 'thought', 'numbers', 'portrayed', 'were', 'too', 'low', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'only', 'problem', 'death', 'penalty', 'process', 'appeals', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'process', 'Here', 'dilemma', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'do', 'want', 'be', 'fact', 'drugs', 'including', 'heroin', 'ecstacy', 'death', 'row', 'come', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Pete', 'sake', 'Too', 'Young', 'Die', 'lot', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Week', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'way', 'film', 'based', 'actions', 'Attina', 'Cannaday', 'David', 'Gray', 'death', 'penalty', 'was', 'reversed', 'sentence', 'was', 'commuted', 'life', '2008', 'was', 'set', 'free', 'prison', 'parole', 'Gray', 'prison', 'life', 'As', 'far', 'facts', 'case', 'are', 'movie', 'fake', 'know', 'such', 'thing', 'gas', 'chamber', 'state', 'Oklahoma']",Too Young to Die?

429845,ANGH6401L9Y0T,630461442X,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Never thought I'd give a movie starring Brad Pitt such a low rating, but this is one very depressing story based on a real crime. Juliette Lewis plays Amanda Sue Bradley, who by the age of fourteen had been repeatedly raped by her step-father, abandoned by her mother, and set adrift. Billy Canton (Brad Pitt) picks her up and sells her for a dirty dancer, fills her with drugs and uses her most brutally. The problem is, the character he plays is a very realistic one: I've run into a few like that in my time. Good looking enough to be alluring, but bad to the bone.One day a soldier named Mike (Michael O'Keefe) is in the bar and defends her when Billy starts hitting her. He's older, and shocked to learn she's only 14. Recently divorced, he takes her home to his two kids. He tells her he's not going to sleep with her because she's too young, but instead she can stay and be housekeeper. That works OK until one night she slips into his bed to ask him to hold her when Billy has called her and frightened her.But he's a soldier, and eventually his commanding officer is informed of the underage girl living with him. He's forced to toss her out to avoid being court-martialed. Of course Billy is right there to pick her up and regain control over her, giving her harder drugs than before.The movie opens with her arrest for murder, but it takes awhile for the story to come out as to (a) who she's accused of murdering, and (b) whether or not she is guilty. But the title of the movie may give you a clue: much of it is based on the fact that Oklahoma has a death penalty, and the DA wants to try her as an adult.Too young to die? Yes, in my opinion, she is.",2,Brad Pitt Wasn't Always Brilliant,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1664,"['Never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'starring', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'low', 'rating', 'one', 'very', 'depressing', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'crime', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Amanda', 'Sue', 'Bradley', 'who', 'age', 'fourteen', 'had', 'been', 'repeatedly', 'raped', 'step-father', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'set', 'adrift', 'Billy', 'Canton', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'up', 'dirty', 'dancer', 'drugs', 'most', 'brutally', 'problem', 'character', 'very', 'realistic', 'one', ""'ve"", 'run', 'few', 'time', 'Good', 'looking', 'enough', 'be', 'alluring', 'bad', 'bone.One', 'day', 'soldier', 'named', 'Mike', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'bar', 'when', 'Billy', 'hitting', 'older', 'shocked', 'learn', 'only', '14', 'Recently', 'divorced', 'home', 'two', 'kids', 'not', 'going', 'sleep', 'too', 'young', 'instead', 'can', 'stay', 'be', 'housekeeper', 'OK', 'one', 'night', 'bed', 'ask', 'hold', 'when', 'Billy', 'called', 'frightened', 'her.But', 'soldier', 'eventually', 'commanding', 'officer', 'informed', 'underage', 'girl', 'living', 'forced', 'toss', 'out', 'avoid', 'being', 'court-martialed', 'course', 'Billy', 'right', 'there', 'pick', 'up', 'regain', 'control', 'giving', 'harder', 'drugs', 'before.The', 'movie', 'arrest', 'murder', 'awhile', 'story', 'come', 'out', 'who', 'accused', 'murdering', 'b', 'not', 'guilty', 'title', 'movie', 'may', 'give', 'clue', 'much', 'based', 'fact', 'Oklahoma', 'death', 'penalty', 'DA', 'try', 'adult.Too', 'young', 'die', 'Yes', 'opinion']",Too Young to Die?

429848,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,630461442X,California Dreaming,"[6, 6]","I finally saw this film the other night, after having it on a wish list for a long time.  I'm mixed on Brad Pitt - I think that his later work is really good, while his early work is pretty borderline at best - and Juliette Lewis has her moments.This was a made-for-TV film, so you know that it won't have amazing production values, which is OK.  I'm not a big special-effects guy anyways.  But there is one glaring flaw with this film, a flaw that you won't know just by watching:  it is based upon an actual case, but the story was changed from that case so much that it loses its value.I have nothing wrong with writers and directors taking liberties with a story.  But sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction so why change it?  But here, the original motivation for the film was to take a left-leaning stance on capital punishment I believe, trying to show that our system is flawed.  Well, that would be fine, except for the fact that, if you read the real story, you will find out that the Attina Cannaday character - one of the convicted killers, played by Ms. Lewis - while sentenced to death, actually had her sentence commuted and she was free on parole a few years ago.  I won't give anything away, but the movie ends quite differently.Also, there were three perpetrators; not two, as the film portrays.  Why did they change this fact?  For dramatic effect?  I'm not sure, but I don't believe that it was necessary to change this in the movie.  And the gal who is a victim was treated, in real life, much worse that was portrayed here.  Why was this changed?  I think I know why, but I'll let you decide if you give it a viewing.Almost a pass here, since they obviously changed the story for political gain.

In this case the young girl was not led into prostitution etc by her friend.  She had already been involved in the dancing etc at more than one club when she met him. She may not even have met him until after her relationship with the victim had ended. She did live with the man that she murdered but when he found out how old she really was he told her she had to move out. There were 3 people who went together to commit the crime but she had already gone to his home yelling & creating a scene a couple weeks prior. It was her idea to go there to supposedly take his van and beat him up etc..  They kidnapped he and his girlfriend and she encouraged her crime friend to rape the girlfriend as she drove the van, which he did.  After the friend removed the victim from the van the girlfriend got away and ran to a house for help.  The next day the mans body was found stabbed to death.  Her and her friend both pointed fingers at the other one for doing it.  I don't believe anyone influenced her to do what she did.  She was given life in prison but has since been paroled.
