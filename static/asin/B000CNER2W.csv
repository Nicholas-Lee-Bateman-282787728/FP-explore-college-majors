959285,A14COU5OWHU5RT,B000CNER2W,Allen,"[0, 2]","AWFUL!!! If ever there was a case for barring someone from the film industry, this piece of trash is it. Money DOES NOT equate talent (or common sense in the case of Nicole Richie).This movie has little plot and Richie's zombie-like ""acting"" puts the deep freeze on anything you might want to get out of the film. There's a reason the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns and little known bit players in Hollywood.There have been some pretty dense actors through the years, but Nicole Richie is by far the runaway winner of all time. She even believes her award from Harvard is something good! Some people learn they don't have the skills to be in the business after the first flop, or at least after the second bomb. Nicole, however is obviously too blinded by her bedazzled sunglasses and purse to be able to recognize she has been in FOUR of the worst movies of all time, been to jail many times, does daily drugs, makes sex tapes, and spends her dads credit card. So the next time someone wants to cast Nicole Richie...nevermind. Said enough. Stay far away from this movie!Was the above review useful to you?

Snyder ""awsnyde""","[10, 12]","I almost turned this off during the first five minutes, as the jokes were obvious and painfully unfunny, the budget was glaringly low, and the dialogue didn't ring true.  I was thinking about winging an email to Roger Ebert, who liked it, asking him what was he thinking.But for some reason I stuck with it, and I ended up liking it a LOT.  True, a lot of the jokes throughout the rest of the movie were still bad, but I also laughed out loud more than a few times.  Moreover, the movie's simply a lot of fun, with smart politics--objectionable only to Neanderthals--and a cast full of recognizable faces.  Though I had to go to IMDB to figure out that the Oriental actress, Emy Coligado, who is obviously too old for this high school kid role, plays Piama on ""Malcolm in the Middle.""Be sure to check out the outtakes on the DVD.  On many DVDs these would consist of a lot of lame, unfunny mugging for the camera, but many of the outtakes on here are actually pretty good.  Julie Bowen is particularly funny, singing that cameltoe song, and explaining why she ""hates"" Angelina Jolie:  ""She has a big chest, big lips, skinny legs, and she's philanthropic.

I was particularly intrigued by the cute red-haired star who came from nowhere and then disappeared into obscurity after this movie was made.  Her name is Stephanie Sherrin.  The movie is your less-than-average High School comedy movie and gets a 2-star rating.  But I really liked watching that cute red-haired girl so I added two stars to give it a 4-star rating.  I'm surprised that Caitlin Wachs didn't shine in this movie.  Caitlin has one of the most beautiful faces I've ever seen.  But in this movie she just looked like another pretty cheerleader.

Rossi,"[2, 3]","Yes, it's some of the jokes like the one in the title that do sort of mar this otherwise brilliant, quick paced movie that pulls out all the stops to make its' point. Like the slightly smarter and more realistically presented Pump Up the Volume, Kids in America delves deep into the root of a major issue, a principal who has nothing but her own interests and future as a superintendant in mind. Unlike Pump whose high school population only really becomes active at the end, Kids' high school's students get involved right away. Throughout the movie they create some positive havoc in some truly jaw dropping ways. At the end, we hear our head revolutionary offer us ""So, did we change the world? If not, its still early in the week"" and yes, it seems that a phrase such as this is a perfect way to end this all too short film. They may have just got the ball rolling, which is exactly as it should be. There is work to be done in this fashion within schools all across America.We send our kids to these learning institutions every day.
