810480,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B0001M7XOS,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[2, 4]","""The Polar Bear King"" is one of the most hilarious fairy tale movies around. From the constant, melodramatic voice-over to the stilted acting to the B-grade ""special"" effects, it's gloriously cheesy. It's got the kick of sauerkraut, the weirdness of lutefisk, and the hilariousness of glogg. It's that bad... or it's that good,your mileage may vary.The story is somewhat simple-a princess lives in the Winterland, dreaming of a flower-filled place. In the meantime, Valemon has become King of the Summerland. An evil sorceress desires to marry him and conquer the world with him. He refuses, so she turns him into a polar bear. He travels north to the Winterland, meets the princess- and it's love at first sight. Three days after meeting, they marry. After all,it's a celebrity marriage. He takes her to the Winterland and she bears him 3 children (because he becomes human at midnight) The wedding night scene is especially odd-the King and his new Queen in bed together--with his mother watching invisibly(???)""The Polar Bear King"" is so bad,it's great!

Wallach,"[0, 0]","My daughter and I read a book based on the same Norwegian Fairy Tale, called East, which apparently has been optioned for making it into a movie.  This film was so poorly made, though, that we had to turn it off after just a half hour.  How can you take a movie seriously which shows a polar bear as an obvious (badly) costumed person?  It's obvious that this was made somewhere outside the US, and then subsequently dubbed into English, with bad, stilted dialog.  Everything about the movie shouts amateurish, so unless you are just mesmerized by horrible quality stuff (ala Plan 9 from Outer Space), this probably isn't one to waste your time with!",1,Laughably bad,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,650,"['daughter', 'read', 'book', 'based', 'same', 'Norwegian', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'called', 'East', 'apparently', 'been', 'optioned', 'making', 'movie', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'made', 'though', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'just', 'half', 'hour', 'How', 'can', 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'polar', 'bear', 'obvious', 'badly', 'costumed', 'person', 'obvious', 'was', 'made', 'somewhere', 'US', 'then', 'subsequently', 'dubbed', 'English', 'bad', 'stilted', 'dialog', 'Everything', 'movie', 'amateurish', 'so', 'are', 'just', 'mesmerized', 'horrible', 'quality', 'stuff', 'ala', 'Plan', '9', 'Outer', 'Space', 'probably', ""n't"", 'one', 'waste', 'time']",N/A
810485,A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,B0001M7XOS,Raisuli the Magnificent,"[0, 1]","I remember taking a chance on the VHS at a Blockbuster outlet that's long since gone.  There was some sort of display talking about the movie, and some text on the back of the VHS box mentioning Jim Henson.  I seem to recall it either won an award or was recognized as an accomplishment by some film critics' group or some such.So, I rented the thing.The summer I rented it was a transitory time for me.  I'm not sure whether I was either susceptible to films at the time, was feeling lost, moody, or just plain ""blah"", but the film took me someplace I hadn't been before, and that's what I like about films and this movie in particular.Granted, this film has a few production shortfalls.  Not many, but they're there.  But for all of the lack of refinement in the SFX department, and a lack of budget for some of the props (probably due to the heavily taxed Nordic societies) and other production values, there's a heart felt tale here that gives one a kind of hope and confidence for the future.  A couple being separated, then being reunited, but this time by the princess doing some role reversal and rescuing her prince, should bring a smile to weary hearts.Me, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I had rented some off beat films the year I rented this, and I was of a mind to see more of the same; i.e. maybe some funny material, only from Norway/Sweden.  Not so.Now, having said all this, and having given it a thumbs up for casual family viewing, I will say that this film could have been executed a little bit better.  Not much, but there's room for improvement.  Jim Henson's polar bear for one needed some more money thrown at it to make it a robotic bear instead of a man (or two) in a costume.  Winterland needed much in the props and art direction departments; i.e. swords and armor for the men, some watch towers, and other medieval security apparatus.  I know that sounds like a bit much for a children's film, but branches and farm tools just don't cut it.  The dogs used as wolves probably should have been wolves (again, no money for the real animals).  The only other thing I can add is that the cinematography was pretty basic and uninspiring.  Again, the budget rears its head.But, for all this, it's a decent watch.  The film nerd in me says the DVD could've benefited from a widescreen presentation, but maybe that's asking for too much.  I have this movie in my collection for sentimental reasons, and not much else.In short, it could have been better shot, but, as it is, it's a respectable kiddy flick.",4,A solid children's film with some production shortfalls.,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,2525,"['remember', 'taking', 'chance', 'VHS', 'Blockbuster', 'outlet', 'long', 'gone', 'was', 'sort', 'display', 'talking', 'movie', 'text', 'back', 'VHS', 'box', 'mentioning', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'seem', 'recall', 'either', 'won', 'award', 'was', 'recognized', 'accomplishment', 'film', 'critics', 'group', 'such.So', 'rented', 'thing.The', 'summer', 'rented', 'was', 'transitory', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'either', 'susceptible', 'films', 'time', 'was', 'feeling', 'lost', 'moody', 'just', 'plain', 'blah', 'film', 'took', 'someplace', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'before', 'what', 'like', 'films', 'movie', 'particular.Granted', 'film', 'few', 'production', 'shortfalls', 'Not', 'many', ""'re"", 'there', 'lack', 'refinement', 'SFX', 'department', 'lack', 'budget', 'props', 'probably', 'due', 'heavily', 'taxed', 'Nordic', 'societies', 'other', 'production', 'values', 'heart', 'felt', 'tale', 'here', 'one', 'kind', 'hope', 'confidence', 'future', 'couple', 'being', 'separated', 'then', 'being', 'reunited', 'time', 'princess', 'doing', 'role', 'reversal', 'rescuing', 'prince', 'should', 'bring', 'smile', 'weary', 'hearts.Me', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'had', 'rented', 'beat', 'films', 'year', 'rented', 'was', 'mind', 'see', 'more', 'same', 'i.e', 'maybe', 'funny', 'material', 'only', 'Norway/Sweden', 'Not', 'so.Now', 'having', 'said', 'having', 'given', 'up', 'casual', 'family', 'viewing', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'executed', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'Not', 'much', 'room', 'improvement', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'polar', 'bear', 'one', 'needed', 'more', 'money', 'thrown', 'make', 'robotic', 'bear', 'instead', 'man', 'two', 'costume', 'Winterland', 'needed', 'much', 'props', 'art', 'direction', 'departments', 'i.e', 'swords', 'armor', 'men', 'watch', 'towers', 'other', 'medieval', 'security', 'apparatus', 'know', 'bit', 'much', 'children', 'film', 'branches', 'farm', 'tools', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'cut', 'dogs', 'used', 'wolves', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wolves', 'again', 'money', 'real', 'animals', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'can', 'add', 'cinematography', 'was', 'pretty', 'basic', 'uninspiring', 'Again', 'budget', 'head.But', 'decent', 'watch', 'film', 'nerd', 'DVD', 'could', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'maybe', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'movie', 'collection', 'sentimental', 'reasons', 'not', 'much', 'else.In', 'short', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'shot', 'respectable', 'kiddy', 'flick']",N/A
