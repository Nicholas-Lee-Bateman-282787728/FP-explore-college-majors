Madigan,"[0, 0]","Lana Turner is so astute and involving in her portrayal of Diane that you are caught up right off, as she brings you into her life of intrigue, mystery, love, and tragedy.Lana Turenr always had that way of looking and speaking so that you feel she is speaking and looking at you. She is not a great great actress, but a very good one, vastly underrated. Diane is one her best, along with Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, By Love Possessed, Portrait In Black, Madame X, and The Rains of Ranchipur.This film is spectacular, in cinemascope, with the evil Marisa Pavan as Catherine De Medici, a startling performance. She had such gifts that were not used!!Roger More is very fine as are all the cast memembers. Not to be overlooked as it was in the 50s when I saw it first run. Buy this and play it for years. One magnificent scene after another!The Miklos Roza score is indeed one of his best.Check out too ""Lust For Life"" for Roza greatness.Note: The credits for ""Diane"" have a crown and draperies beneath it.. it is the same credit backdrop for Grace Kelly's fabulous ""The Swan.

332632,AD2BIAIH78QI5,6302760062,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[27, 27]","Years ago, my friend David had a book about history as told thru Hollywood movies, and that was how I first learned of the movie, ""Diane"".  Seemed a silly movie, advertised by a dueling shot of French prince Roger Moore matching his epee with courtesan Lana Turner in her sixteenth-century Tudor style wimple. Fast forward to 2002, and put us in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where that venerable institution decides that a good movie to link to its current tapestry exhibit would be--yep--""Diane"", of all things. The week before, it had been ""A Man for All Seasons"". Well, I just had to check this out; I mean, I've NEVER even seen it listed in a tv guide. Saw it with Edith just last night.Not bad! Not a classic, but not bad.For one thing, the costumes are just wonderful, the creations of Walter Plunkett of ""Gone with the Wind"" fame. No, they're not authentic, but this was a Lana Turner movie, you know, not a BBC documentary. So, if you like gorgeous women in velvet and pearls, this is an appropriate flick for you. Lana is appealing and I didn't really mind Roger Moore, although another reviewer found him wooden. The real Henri II was a weakling--that why he was controlled by his mistress--so that a stronger performance would not really have made sense.It is in the supporting performances that we have our best people. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is a Nostradamus-kind of astrologer who tells Henri's wife Catherine de Medici to dry her tears over her husband's lack of sexual interest and concentrate on her destiny as future Queen of France. Henry Daniell does a great job as Catherine's advisor who keeps those intrigues coming--always a joy to watch him. The actor playing King Francis I had a lot of bravado and some set of choppers. I liked him a lot.  And the woman playing Catherine was excellent, and actually there is where the film comes off the hinge for me.Because ultimately, her Catherine wins the sympathy of the viewer away from Lana Turner's Diane. After all, she is the new King's lawful wife, and seems young and inexperienced. Might also be that there was so much publicity years gone by about the Prince Charles-Princess Diana-Camilla Parker-Bowes triangle that viewers of our generation would identify Catherine with the maritally neglected Princess Di. I was glad to see Catherine pounce on her newfound power once the King got mortally wounded, and assert herself finally.Upshot of the whole experience: ""Diane"" is NOT a silly movie, by no means. You'll get a taste of French monarchal history (albeit a rather small one) that often Americans know nothing about, and see some really outstanding dresses for glamour queen Turner.",4,"Actually, Better Than I Thought It Would Be!",1022371200,"05 26, 2002",2002,2662,"['Years', 'ago', 'friend', 'David', 'had', 'book', 'about', 'history', 'told', 'thru', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'was', 'how', 'first', 'learned', 'movie', 'Diane', 'Seemed', 'silly', 'movie', 'advertised', 'dueling', 'shot', 'French', 'prince', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'matching', 'epee', 'courtesan', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'sixteenth-century', 'Tudor', 'style', 'wimple', 'Fast', 'forward', '2002', 'put', 'Metropolitan', 'Museum', 'Art', 'where', 'venerable', 'institution', 'good', 'movie', 'link', 'current', 'tapestry', 'exhibit', 'would', 'be', 'Diane', 'things', 'week', 'had', 'been', 'Man', 'Seasons', 'Well', 'just', 'had', 'check', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'NEVER', 'even', 'seen', 'listed', 'tv', 'guide', 'Saw', 'Edith', 'just', 'last', 'night.Not', 'bad', 'Not', 'classic', 'not', 'bad.For', 'one', 'thing', 'costumes', 'are', 'just', 'wonderful', 'creations', 'Walter', 'Plunkett', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'fame', 'No', ""'re"", 'not', 'authentic', 'was', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'movie', 'know', 'not', 'BBC', 'documentary', 'So', 'like', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'velvet', 'pearls', 'appropriate', 'flick', 'Lana', 'appealing', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'reviewer', 'found', 'wooden', 'real', 'Henri', 'II', 'was', 'weakling', 'why', 'was', 'controlled', 'mistress', 'so', 'stronger', 'performance', 'would', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'made', 'sense.It', 'supporting', 'performances', 'have', 'best', 'people', 'Sir', 'Cedric', 'Hardwicke', 'Nostradamus-kind', 'astrologer', 'who', 'Henri', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'de', 'Medici', 'dry', 'tears', 'husband', 'lack', 'sexual', 'interest', 'concentrate', 'destiny', 'future', 'Queen', 'France', 'Henry', 'Daniell', 'great', 'job', 'Catherine', 'advisor', 'who', 'intrigues', 'coming', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'actor', 'playing', 'King', 'Francis', 'had', 'lot', 'bravado', 'set', 'choppers', 'liked', 'lot', 'woman', 'playing', 'Catherine', 'was', 'excellent', 'actually', 'where', 'film', 'hinge', 'me.Because', 'ultimately', 'Catherine', 'sympathy', 'viewer', 'away', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Diane', 'new', 'King', 'lawful', 'wife', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'Might', 'also', 'be', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'publicity', 'years', 'gone', 'Prince', 'Charles-Princess', 'Diana-Camilla', 'Parker-Bowes', 'triangle', 'viewers', 'generation', 'would', 'identify', 'Catherine', 'maritally', 'neglected', 'Princess', 'Di', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'Catherine', 'pounce', 'newfound', 'power', 'King', 'got', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'assert', 'finally.Upshot', 'whole', 'experience', 'Diane', 'NOT', 'silly', 'movie', 'means', ""'ll"", 'get', 'taste', 'French', 'monarchal', 'history', 'rather', 'small', 'one', 'often', 'Americans', 'know', 'nothing', 'see', 'really', 'outstanding', 'dresses', 'glamour', 'queen', 'Turner']",Diane VHS
332633,A1AQ9R3L8ZWWEC,6302760062,"LMG ""ancient art prof""","[2, 2]","Before beginning a review of this movie, I must give plaudits to reviewer Sam A. Juliano III for his recognition of Miklos Rozsa's beautiful score. From the main theme, which is Diane's, to the various supporting themes that, for example, underscore the wizard-like presence of Sir Cedric Hardwicke, the machinations of Henry Daniell, and the emotional state of Marisa Pavan as Catherine de Medici, this film is an aural as well as visual feast. Both the movie and score were highly underrated at the time. This was Hollywood, NOT precise history - but was close enough.Lana Turner as Diane displays both intellect and beauty. She captures the fancy of the King of France who appoints her tutor to his youthful second son played by Roger Moore in his first screen appearance. After awhile, they become lovers - a poorly kept secret. But Moore must marry, and so he is betrothed to a very young and innocent Catherine de Medici whose family has secret plans for her future. Catherine consults a Nostradamus type seer in the form of Hardwicke who predicts a trio of sons in her future. More ominous is the vision of a young boy who accompanies Hardwicke; he sees a fatal tragedy in the future that involves ""a cage of gold and a wild boar"". After Catherine leaves H, he tells his companions that her husband who will become king is destined to be killed by his best friend.  Shortly afterward, Moore and his bf go wild boar hunting. The forest of birch trees in which the boar is to be hunted takes on the appearance of ""a cage of gold"" in the eyes of Moore's friend. As the hunt continues, Moore is surprised by the boar and is gored but does not die.  The prophecy is apparently averted. Moore recovers and his affair with Diane continues unabated. Her power at court continues to grow and even exceeds that of Catherine's who becomes queen when Moore's older brother dies suddenly from foul play and Moore becomes king. Catherine is suspect but eventually cleared.  A momentary fainting spell during the investigation reveals that she is with child. The Medicis are impatient for Catherine to gain her full power. Their intention is to control France from Italy. However, they dare not kill Diane since that would bring the wrath of the king down on all.  Word comes from Italy: ""If you cannot rid yourself of the bird, cut down the tree in which it nests.""Plotting on the part of Daniell now moves into high gear. An upcoming mock jousting tournament is rigged. Without giving too much away, suffice it to say that, for the occasion, Moore is dressed completely in golden armor. His helmet has a visor composed of vertical strips that look like ""a cage of gold"". His Italian opponent has a ""wild boar"" displayed on his shield. Yet, the Italian is defeated. But, in a final showdown insisted upon by Moore between his bf and himself (the only two left), the friend is forced to borrow the Italian's shield since his own was too badly damaged. Throw in one lance with a deliberately designed breakable cover and...A final attempt to avert the predicted calamity on the part of the young boy who predicted it all after suddenly arriving with Hardwicke to observe the festivities is ""too late"".  What must be will be. (Note that all this occurs some 10 years after the prediction and the young boy hasn't aged a day.) Catherine now emerges as a force to be reckoned with and everyone gets his just deserts. However, a final reconciliation of sorts between Diane and Catherine does occur. Diane is banished from the court and left with nothing of her lover Henri. But, at the last moment, Catherine repents and gives her son a ring that Diane had given to Henri and which Catherine had removed from her husband's finger. She tells her son to give it to Diane. He immediately races to the courtyard just as Diane is about to leave in a horse drawn carriage and gives her the ring. A glance from Diane upwards meets that of Catherine and the unspoken moment says it all. As the coach leaves the confines of the palatial courtyard, Rozsa's music reaches a crescendo pitch as love, death, betrayal, forgiveness, and justice all come together in a rousing climax.It took some 45 years for the complete score to this movie to be released. Do we have to wait another 45 for a DVD!!?  This is a disgrace! The costumes, the glamour, the storyline, the fine but unrecognized acting, and the emotional impact deserve a better fate than an aged VHS.
