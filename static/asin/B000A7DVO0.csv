Since the complaint - which still remains - is how fighters from different eras could be ""evenly"" matched up, it was a natural for some promoter to take the human element out of the equation with the emerging technology.A Miami-based boxing promoter made the idea a reality in the late 1960s with a series of radio ""fights"" between champs of different eras, with the results figured out through a computer, and the action transcribed for airplay.The success of that series brought the ""Superfight"" of Muhammad Ali v. Rocky Marciano. Neither fighter was active at the time - Ali was suspended due to his religious stance against serving in the military and Marciano had not been in the ring for many years.The participants met in a sparring session in 1969 where the action was choreographed and then edited for the ""match."" On January 20, 1970, boxing fans in 1,500 theaters in the U.S. and Europe witnessed the event, which actually had two different endings (one was only shown in several European markets). The movie also aired once on ABC's Wide World of Sports.The hype surrounding the movie included the publishing of a magazine with photographs from the sparring session and leaving the reader guessing on what would happen in the latter rounds. What was most surprising was the outstanding physical condition of Marciano; who had been retired for about 13 years. He was to tragically die in a plane crash months after the film was shot.More of a novelty piece for the boxing enthusiast, it showed how fans then had a unique interest in an emerging tool - the computer - as a means to determine the outcome in what remains a sport truly driven by the human psyche.",3,The Man-Machine,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,1793,"['Professional', 'boxing', 'seemed', 'best', 'sport', 'let', 'computer', 'decide', 'who', 'was', 'greatest', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'ever', 'complaint', 'still', 'how', 'fighters', 'different', 'eras', 'could', 'be', 'evenly', 'matched', 'up', 'was', 'natural', 'promoter', 'take', 'human', 'element', 'equation', 'emerging', 'technology.A', 'Miami-based', 'boxing', 'promoter', 'made', 'idea', 'reality', 'late', '1960s', 'series', 'radio', 'fights', 'champs', 'different', 'eras', 'results', 'figured', 'out', 'computer', 'action', 'transcribed', 'airplay.The', 'success', 'series', 'brought', 'Superfight', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'v.', 'Rocky', 'Marciano', 'fighter', 'was', 'active', 'time', 'Ali', 'was', 'suspended', 'due', 'religious', 'stance', 'serving', 'military', 'Marciano', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'ring', 'many', 'years.The', 'participants', 'met', 'sparring', 'session', '1969', 'where', 'action', 'was', 'choreographed', 'then', 'edited', 'match', 'January', '20', '1970', 'boxing', 'fans', '1,500', 'theaters', 'U.S.', 'Europe', 'witnessed', 'event', 'actually', 'had', 'two', 'different', 'endings', 'one', 'was', 'only', 'shown', 'several', 'European', 'markets', 'movie', 'also', 'aired', 'once', 'ABC', 'Wide', 'World', 'Sports.The', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'included', 'publishing', 'magazine', 'photographs', 'sparring', 'session', 'leaving', 'reader', 'guessing', 'would', 'happen', 'latter', 'rounds', 'What', 'was', 'most', 'surprising', 'was', 'outstanding', 'physical', 'condition', 'Marciano', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'retired', '13', 'years', 'was', 'tragically', 'die', 'plane', 'crash', 'months', 'film', 'was', 'shot.More', 'novelty', 'piece', 'boxing', 'enthusiast', 'showed', 'how', 'fans', 'then', 'had', 'unique', 'interest', 'emerging', 'tool', 'computer', 'means', 'determine', 'outcome', 'what', 'sport', 'truly', 'driven', 'human', 'psyche']",The Superfight - Marciano vs. Ali

A computer determined the winner between Marciano and Ali. Both fighters acted out the ""script"" for this film. I was not disappointed when I saw it. It was very interesting and truly legendary as both Marciano and Ali were still in great fighting shape. Marciano was known to add muscle just for this computer-simulated fight because he took it so seriously while Ali was dancing. They say ""styles make fights"" and this boxing match proves it. Both Marciano and Ali have amazing records and legacies. Both fighters box convincingly with the computer tabulating results at the end of each round.Special Features: Complete original fight, One-hour Superfight Documentary, produced by Michael DeLisa, author of The Cinderella Man, Color booklet of the history and photos from the fight, Bonus: Footage of Marciano's and Ali's careers, Bonus: All 15 (one hour each) original Radio Fantasy FightsBuy this DVD.

923292,A1HXI1A02H60WY,B000A7DVO0,Mike Brecher,"[3, 4]","Ali-Marciano never really happened, of course, and yet, in a sense, it did. If you were around when the computerized fight was originally shown, this DVD will help you relive an intriguing sports conundrum. Intriguing and exciting -- the staging was undeniably well done, more realistically than any fight sequence has ever been staged for a Hollywood movie.Did the right man ""win""? I have no ax to grind between Ali and Marciano. I was a teen when the movie was first shown with a keen interest in boxing (the sport, not the joke it has become in recent years) and I took Rocky to win because, based on the evidence we had of Ali pre his hiatus, Marciano seemed just the one kind of fighter who would always have given him trouble. Two years later, at MSG, this hunch was proven right by Frazier, a Marciano replica in style and build. My belief -- and I can hear the chorus of disapproval as I write these words -- is that Joe Frazier at his peak (which he lost, for several reasons, quite quickly) would ALWAYS have beaten Ali at his. Doesn't make Ali any less of a great.One gripe with the DVD. Potentially the most interesting extras on this two-disc set are audio recordings of 15 episodes of a fantasy tournament between 16 former heavyweight champions broadcast on radio in the late 1960s (and produced by the Superfight producer). The broadcasts are fabulously authentic-sounding, but listening to them on the DVD has been rendered almost pointless by the fact that most cut out before the climax! Maybe the original, 40-year-old masters are imperfect and this is the best the DVD's producers could do; maybe they just did a lousy job. Either way, a great pity. But the Superfight itself is in good shape.",4,A Piece of History That Wasn't,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,1714,"['Ali-Marciano', 'never', 'really', 'happened', 'course', 'yet', 'sense', 'did', 'were', 'around', 'when', 'computerized', 'fight', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', 'DVD', 'will', 'help', 'relive', 'intriguing', 'sports', 'conundrum', 'Intriguing', 'exciting', 'staging', 'was', 'undeniably', 'well', 'done', 'more', 'realistically', 'fight', 'sequence', 'ever', 'been', 'staged', 'Hollywood', 'movie.Did', 'right', 'man', 'win', 'have', 'ax', 'grind', 'Ali', 'Marciano', 'was', 'teen', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'keen', 'interest', 'boxing', 'sport', 'not', 'joke', 'become', 'recent', 'years', 'took', 'Rocky', 'win', 'because', 'based', 'evidence', 'had', 'Ali', 'pre', 'hiatus', 'Marciano', 'seemed', 'just', 'one', 'kind', 'fighter', 'who', 'would', 'always', 'have', 'given', 'trouble', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'MSG', 'hunch', 'was', 'proven', 'right', 'Frazier', 'Marciano', 'replica', 'style', 'build', 'belief', 'can', 'hear', 'chorus', 'disapproval', 'write', 'words', 'Joe', 'Frazier', 'peak', 'lost', 'several', 'reasons', 'quite', 'quickly', 'would', 'ALWAYS', 'have', 'beaten', 'Ali', ""n't"", 'make', 'Ali', 'less', 'great.One', 'gripe', 'DVD', 'Potentially', 'most', 'interesting', 'extras', 'two-disc', 'set', 'are', 'audio', 'recordings', '15', 'episodes', 'fantasy', 'tournament', '16', 'former', 'heavyweight', 'champions', 'broadcast', 'radio', 'late', '1960s', 'produced', 'Superfight', 'producer', 'broadcasts', 'are', 'fabulously', 'authentic-sounding', 'listening', 'DVD', 'been', 'rendered', 'almost', 'pointless', 'fact', 'most', 'cut', 'out', 'climax', 'Maybe', 'original', '40-year-old', 'masters', 'are', 'imperfect', 'best', 'DVD', 'producers', 'could', 'do', 'maybe', 'just', 'did', 'lousy', 'job', 'way', 'great', 'pity', 'Superfight', 'good', 'shape']",The Superfight - Marciano vs. Ali

All together it was a great movie night. We repeated it several days later. Ali, aka Casius Clay was having a lot of trouble with Uncle Sam about not wanting to be a soldier. He appeared in a Candid camera show too. The fight was just as exciting as any championship fight could be. Later I read that they fought 63 2 minute rounds to make the movie. Ali was a little upset over the ending in the movies I saw. They really did beat each other up pretty good. If you haven't seen this you should. Marciano didn't live very long after making it but he'll live on forever now. How's that for a fight that never was?

It seemed like a real fight, but with the benefit of knowing it was not real, and no one was really getting hurt. It was originally even shown in theaters on closed-ciruit TV. It brought back memories of when heavy weight championship fights were world-wide events.Though I have great admiration for boxers, particularly for these two, I think that the sport itself is cruel.  But that was not a problem here since they spliced together footage of the two fighters sparing with each other (and subtly pulling punches), according to computer projections.  I'm not sure that anybody could have beaten Ali, the greatest athlete these eyes have ever seen, in his prime; but, who knows what a war-horse like Marciano could have done at his peak. The result created a furor, with law suits flying back and forth with the makers of the film.  The 'event' was enhanced by leading boxing experts who differed on how the fight should have turned out. It was taken seriously by folks at the time, and maybe even now; but for someone like me, years later, it was great fun.",5,Great  fun!,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1234,"['saw', '1970', ""'fight"", 'way', 'home', 'trip', 'UK', 'thought', 'was', 'truly', 'exciting', 'indeed', 'many', 'Boeing-767', 'passengers', 'seemed', 'engrossed', 'seemed', 'real', 'fight', 'benefit', 'knowing', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'getting', 'hurt', 'was', 'originally', 'even', 'shown', 'theaters', 'closed-ciruit', 'TV', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'when', 'heavy', 'weight', 'championship', 'fights', 'were', 'world-wide', 'events.Though', 'have', 'great', 'admiration', 'boxers', 'particularly', 'two', 'think', 'sport', 'cruel', 'was', 'not', 'problem', 'here', 'spliced', 'together', 'footage', 'two', 'fighters', 'sparing', 'other', 'subtly', 'pulling', 'punches', 'according', 'computer', 'projections', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anybody', 'could', 'have', 'beaten', 'Ali', 'greatest', 'athlete', 'eyes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'prime', 'who', 'what', 'war-horse', 'Marciano', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'peak', 'result', 'created', 'furor', 'law', 'suits', 'flying', 'back', 'forth', 'makers', 'film', ""'event"", 'was', 'enhanced', 'leading', 'boxing', 'experts', 'who', 'differed', 'how', 'fight', 'should', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'taken', 'seriously', 'folks', 'time', 'maybe', 'even', 'now', 'someone', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'great', 'fun']",The Superfight - Marciano vs. Ali

Lots of extras and cool graphics. Great idea to include a radio tournament from around 1968, it was not related to the Superfight. They were two separate ideas. Ali lost in the semis of the radio tourney and ironically Marciano won it by beating Jack Dempsey in the final.Im a big Marciano fan and loved the dvd quality footage of the Rock training. As for history they got it right. I think Marciano and Ali were the two greatest champions in history with Joe Louis a close third. As for the the outcome I completely agree. Muhammad Ali was truly great (and made sure to constantly tell everybody) but he was not invincible. Joe Frazier fought him 3 times and gave Ali everything he wanted in every fight, winning once. Ken Norton matched up even better than Frazier, Ali never could figure him out. In their 3 fights Norton dominated the first one (even breaking Ali's jaw), lost a close decision in the second, then got robbed in the third encounter by one of the worst judges decisions in boxing history (please watch this and judge for yourself). My point is that Ali was not invincible, and I think Marciano, the best conditioned champ in history, would have caught up with anyone in rounds 10-15. He just never stopped throwing punches.And so all in all, a great DVD.",4,Ali vs Marciano,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,1396,"['got', 'right', 'Very', 'cool', 'DVD', 'boxing', 'fans', 'owned', 'original', 'version', 'love', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'DVD', 'Lots', 'extras', 'cool', 'graphics', 'Great', 'idea', 'include', 'radio', 'tournament', '1968', 'was', 'not', 'related', 'Superfight', 'were', 'two', 'separate', 'ideas', 'Ali', 'lost', 'semis', 'radio', 'tourney', 'ironically', 'Marciano', 'won', 'beating', 'Jack', 'Dempsey', 'final.Im', 'big', 'Marciano', 'fan', 'loved', 'dvd', 'quality', 'footage', 'Rock', 'training', 'history', 'got', 'right', 'think', 'Marciano', 'Ali', 'were', 'two', 'greatest', 'champions', 'history', 'Joe', 'Louis', 'close', 'third', 'outcome', 'completely', 'agree', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'made', 'sure', 'constantly', 'tell', 'everybody', 'was', 'not', 'invincible', 'Joe', 'Frazier', 'fought', '3', 'times', 'gave', 'Ali', 'everything', 'wanted', 'fight', 'winning', 'once', 'Ken', 'Norton', 'matched', 'up', 'even', 'better', 'Frazier', 'Ali', 'never', 'could', 'figure', 'out', '3', 'fights', 'Norton', 'dominated', 'first', 'one', 'even', 'breaking', 'Ali', 'jaw', 'lost', 'close', 'decision', 'second', 'then', 'got', 'robbed', 'third', 'encounter', 'one', 'worst', 'judges', 'decisions', 'boxing', 'history', 'please', 'watch', 'judge', 'yourself', 'point', 'Ali', 'was', 'not', 'invincible', 'think', 'Marciano', 'best', 'conditioned', 'champ', 'history', 'would', 'have', 'caught', 'up', 'anyone', '10-15', 'just', 'never', 'stopped', 'throwing', 'punches.And', 'so', 'all', 'great', 'DVD']",The Superfight - Marciano vs. Ali
