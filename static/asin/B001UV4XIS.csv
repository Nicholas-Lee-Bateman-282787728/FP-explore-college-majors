1241084,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B001UV4XIS,AIROLF,"[29, 43]","Let me begin by offering unadulterated praise for everyone involved with the making of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, the last film of the highly-successful Harry Potter franchise. One can not critique this movie with anything but praise for the filmmaking of the last Harry Potter film is the reason we all fell in love with Harry Potter books to begin with - it's pure magic.The technology for creating movies was invented for the purpose of taking written stories and setting them not simply into images, but breathing life into them. Moving pictures should not only move on the screen, but move the viewer into action. During the screening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, people applauded, laughed, screamed, stomped, and cried (or at least got misty eyed).Seeing this film in 3D added to the feeling of being in the movie, being a part of the tremendously rich and complex Wizarding World originally created by J.K. Rowling.Simply put, this film is thrilling to watch and causes awe upon the viewing of it. The battle scenes in the last 30-35 minutes of the movie are some of the best action/adventure sequences I have ever seen on screen.The art direction is impeccable. Every scene is done with class and style. Particularly impressive, are the scenes that contain material that can't be seen - an invisibility cloak, protective charms, etc. The special effects are probably the best in the series. As has been the case with special effects in the past Harry Potter films - from house elves to dementors to dragons - this film has plenty of surreal CGI. In HP8, your mind will not be able to believe your eyes - the CGI effects look real and, in 3D, they actually feel real too. It is safe to say that HP8 captures the menagerie of CGI creatures from all previous films, adds several new ones, and perfects all effects.The cinematography by Eduardo Serra is fantastic. It is better than even in the last Deathly Hallows film.The soundtrack is once again by Alexandre Desplat, who scored the first Deathly Hallows film. And what a difference his eerie take is from his predecessors - Nicholas Hooper, Patrick Doyle, and John Williams. The music is like a fourth dimension of the film and enriches the film tremendously.The script, as six of the others in the franchise, was written by Steve Kloves, and he makes sure that the spirit of the books lives in the film. The script gives a few hints as to the events of the previous seven movies, but obviously, can not serve as a cliff notes version of all the events. I suggest reacquainting oneself with the broad strokes of the book before heading to the theater for the latest in this franchise.Sure, several creative licenses were taken for this film as is the case for any film ever made. Personally, I'd rather have seen the book's epilogue (coda) as an after-the-credits bit, instead of as part of the movie; overall though, I'd like to say that the film is impressive in its scope.Where the HP franchise has always struggled, in my opinion, has been the acting. The adult actors have always been extraordinary, which should come as no surprise since the list of actors is a who's who in British cinema - Alan Rickman, Dame Maggie Smith, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Julie Walters, John Hurt, and Jason Isaacs. The latest recruit to this excellent company is Kelly Macdonald, who whimsically plays the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw. While the adults have always been pitch perfect in their portrayals of the roles (except for Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore, which he graciously amended once the fans complained), the child actors have struggled with their parts.Therefore, it has always seemed unfair that the majority of screen time was devoted to the trio of young stars who first got cast simply because they bore a likeness to their characters. The trio - Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint - have struggled to up the ante on their acting over the years, but it seems that they have finally figured out a successful formula for their craft. These three actors are still out-acted by the supporting actors in their midst, but at least it is no longer a ridiculous noticeable divide. This is as it should be - just as their characters have closed the magical ability divide with their teachers and parents, so too have the younger actors learned to stand their ground.In the end, and this is surely the end of one of the most successful children's film franchise of our time, I would recommend not only watching this film, but watching this film on a big screen. It's a movie that would appeal to anyone who likes thrillers, dramas, fantasy, action, adventure, family films but, above all, being entertained in the theater.",5,"In the words of Ronald Weasley,

I think the movies have done an excellent job staying true to the books and cutting out what isn't needed in the movies (mostly with the 4th and 5th one)The 1st part of the Deathly Hallows was good. It was slow, but the first chunk of the book was too. But I knew that this movie would be exciting and fast-pace. I was crossing fingers hoping it would go out with a bang.It did.As always, the acting is just fantastic. All of the actors are so talented. Never once does anything feel sub-par or faked or forced.The special effects were just...wow. I was impressed with how realistic the dragon was and Nagini looked just as real.I thought the movie would be depressing. After all, the 7th book was not exactly flowers and rainbows. However, the movie keeps a serious tone, but also throws in comedic lines to lighten the mood.So, as you can gather, I loved this movie. Why, you may be wondering, only four stars?****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****Mostly because of how the deaths were handled. Most of the characters haven't been so much as mentioned (in part 1 or this one), so at the end of the first battle, when you see Fred, Lupin and Tonks, if you didn't know who died, you'd be thinking,""What?"" Fred, in this film, only says, ""Yeah."" (In reply to George's question, ""Okay there, Freddie?"") Then you see his dead body and instead of an emotional ending, you're thinking, ""Oh...okay then.""END SPOILERSAlso, the effects to make Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny look older could have been better. Harry looks a little bit older and they just put Ron in a fat suit. Besides that, it looks as though they just put on old person clothes and called it good.But besides that, this movies is amazing.

1241107,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B001UV4XIS,amerdale876,"[1, 3]","I remember 10 years ago when the first installment in the Harry Potter film series was about to be released and how excited a co-worker of mine (at the time) was to see it. I couldn't understand why she was so excited and when she compared the book series to Tolkien's masterpiece trilogy ""Lord of the Rings"" and Lucas's masterpiece saga ""Star Wars,"" I definitely was perplexed and cynical. After all, how could a few books (at the time) about a boy wizard compare to the profound mythological themes that represent life itself? Unlike most fans, I did not read the books and went into the film with an unbiased mind. When I saw the first installment, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I wasn't really impressed. It wasn't until 2004's ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" -- when the series began getting darker -- that I started getting into the series. Now, I'm still no major fan, but I thoroughly enjoy Harry Potter and am reading the books. When I heard ""Deathly Hallows"" was going to be separated into two parts, I actually liked the idea because I knew the filmmakers were so dedicated to getting in as much as they could of the book and did not want to rush the production. With ""Deathly Hallows, Part One,"" I found a slight similarity to Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece ""Kill Bill."" InKill Bill: Volume 1 [Blu-ray], there was plenty of action, while inKill Bill: Volume 2 [Blu-ray], there was still a little action, but mostly talk, drama and psychological meanings. Well, in ""Deathly Hallows Part One,"" the parts were switched so that it was the one that was made up of mostly talk, drama and psychological elements. In this installment, ""Deathly Hallows"" goes out with a bang the way ""Kill Bill Part One"" did; it's basically non-stop action with the drama as a natural after-effect. Only in ""Deathly Hallows Part Two,"" rather than ending with a jaw-dropping question (like ""Kill Bill Part One""), it ends with satisfying closure for pretty much all of the characters and the acting is superb (anyone who wants to know how the other characters' futures end up, you can either read the books or look it up on the internet); I was one of many in the audience who was cheering when seeing what happens to Bellatrix (Helena Bonham-Carter, an actress I don't very much like). Before this one, my favorite of the Harry Potter film series was ""The Half-Blood Prince.""

1241108,A36AWTXU52XH4C,B001UV4XIS,"Amit ""Amit""","[7, 12]","I have nothing to say about the movie. It is known masterpiece. So is the blu ray. However, that 'ultraviolet' digital copy is CRAP. I am saying this after trying everything. Digital copies previously given were so simple and easy to download and manage, but this one is a nightmare even for a cyber savvy guy. Here is my experience in detail for others to read. Hope it may save you some time.1. Unless you type in the 'flixster' right, the webpage wont open. The spelling is FLIXSTER, not FLIXTER (the mistake many have inadvaertantly made)2. Once you get on there, it will ask you to create TWO seperate accounts a) Flixster and b) Ultraviolet (my question is WHAT FOR? Why isn't the code sufficient?)3. They will ask you to agree their terms and conditions so many times, you wont have any patience to read all of them, as you will be eager to see the movie. I don't know how to interpret it in terms of your protection legally.4. After creating TWO seperate accounts, they will give you a box to type your code (you think 'finally!'? keep reading..), after that, you will go on another page to see options (stream now, dwnld to your pc, etc).5. Even after this, they will ask you to install TWO applications (Flixster collections and Adobe Air, which, in turn is required for flixster collections to function normally....why can't flixster work by itself?).When you INSTALL the applications, MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE THE TICKS in front of the boxes that have some crappy services (flixster would like to send you some stupid notifications..etc..). Otherwise your inbox is surely gonna overflow!!!6. N O W you did it! Congratulations! Click on the movie download page and be patient to wait further. You never know how long it will take for the movie to dwnld. I have a 12 Mbps download speed and it took me almost 30 min to complete this 2 GB movie (I have an HDTV connected to the same network and streaming HD movies has never been a problem to me). They cannot blame that the server was overwhelmed. I am downloading one week past its release!7. THE CLIMAX: I played the movie (using flixster collections, NOT RealOne or iTunes). It plays well. However, when I look for the file in pc, I cannot find it! Then I Googled and found that they have an option in the 'flixster collections"". Follow this path- Collection > Add > select My Computer as location > Select directory > Check on box ""add to iTunes library"". Now it should show there, right? NOPE!I have tried everything- Try loace the file, add it to multiple folders, multiple loactions, try adding it to iTunes through flixter collections (which kept failing all the time), Add the file/folder through iTunes menu. NOTHING WORKS.Okay, the last option was to try playing it in RealOne/any other media player and then convert it to iPhone compatible files (which I did for hundreds of videos). THE FILE JUST WON'T PLAY IN ANY MEDIA PLAYER!!! WHAT RUBBISH? I see the 2 GB file sitting in 'video' folder (The file name is ""ADS_UV_HarryPotter7P2_main_FAXS_2000k_dl""), but I CANNOT PLAY IT IN ANYTHING BUT Flixster collections! FORGET ADDING IT TO iTunes!In total, I spent 3 relentless hrs to get to my digital copy only to get frustrated. I didn't get this frustrated even while installing any software or recovering my pc. This is not just crap but a huge scam to promote flixster collections (I never heard of that media player before, though I have flixster app on iPnone). It is still OK to promote new things, but not at this cost. They are luring us by saying that you can stream anytime anywhere, but they don't deliver the simplest and the most basic stuff. Plus, when we have an option of renting an HD movie straight from Amazon and other internet video services, who wants to see this crap on their Google TV? FLixster and Warner, FIRST MAKE IT PLAY ON MY iTunes and then make promises.It is clear that this has been a huge deal for Warner Home Video, who have cashed every single dime from Harry Potter series (which is fine for me), but this is nonsense and torture for the fans.  So, go for it if you are ready to spend enough time only to see a downloaded copy of the movie. Forget about adding it to your iPod. I wrote all this only to let others know what is in store for them. BOO the ultraviolet copy. If you think all these efforts are worth for downloading ONE digital copy, you are welcome to the show!Also, if anyone finds a way to nail it, please let me know. I will be happy to correct my mistakes (if there are any). Good luck and thanks for reading.",2,"Worthless ""ultraviolet digital copy"". Less stars only for that. Read if you want to save your time.

1241114,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B001UV4XIS,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[0, 1]","This movie is not the easiest to review, basically either you are a fan of the series and will be seeing this movie or you are not and then this is not the place to start. This is also the second part of what is in essence one long movie so you really can not see this without having seen the Deathly Hollows Part 1 first or this movie will not make sense, part 2 picks up right where part 1 left off and offer no explanation so it is not friendly to new viewers, but then it is not meant to be either.I have a bit of conflicting feelings about this movie, at one side I think it was a worthy end to the series, it was dramatic, grandiose and epic like it was supposed to be, but at the same time the movie did feel a bit tame here and there and while it is a very good movie I sort of had hoped for more. Part 2 continues the fetch quest from the last movie and then escalates into a fantasy war movie. The special effects are very good and it do keep a nice balance between action, drama and character development. Each major character get their change to shine and none is left forgotten. The conclusion feel satisfying and unlike many movie franchises the Harry Potter movies have one continuous story that do properly end. Now as I say the movie do have a good end, but it sort of feel a bit watered down. I have been trying for days to put my finger on what exactly I mean but I just can't. When watching the other Harry Potter movies I was completely enthralled, I forgot about my popcorn, about anything else and for the duration of the movie nothing else mattered, Deathly Hallows part 2 was engaging to, but not to that degree, at time I found myself thinking about other things and when it was done I was thinking, hum...good movie, good end to the series, but something is missing.Perhaps what I am looking for is that the movie felt to polished, it was good, dark and gritty at times, but because it had to cover so much material in such a short amount of time it lacked the litter quirks and character interactions which made the other movies feel real, when the characters did interact it felt much more scripted. So much of the later half of the movie depend on the viewer caring what happens to the characters, and that part felt a bit rushed.Now other than the complaint above I have nothing but good things to say about part 2. The music is great, the effects is great, the story is great, the acting is great, the camera work and other theatrical details is great. The director have had a big budget for this movie and have spent it wisely and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part 2 is a gorgeous movie. I think perhaps the last Harry Potter book should have been parted into three rather than two parts to give the director more time to let the story develop, but with the time alloted by the format I think everyone involved with this movie did a good job. I recommend this movie to fans of the series, however if you are a newcomer to the series go back and start with the first movie and watch them in order.It is refreshing to see a movie series get a worthy end, and this is a worthy end, it do provide a proper payoff for seeing all the other movies in the series and all round I think this is a good movie who do have some flaws but who really do a good job in telling a fantastic story.",4,A worthy ending for a great series.,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,3320,"['movie', 'not', 'easiest', 'review', 'basically', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'then', 'not', 'place', 'start', 'also', 'second', 'part', 'what', 'essence', 'one', 'long', 'movie', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'having', 'seen', 'Deathly', 'Hollows', 'Part', '1', 'first', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'part', '2', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'part', '1', 'left', 'off', 'offer', 'explanation', 'not', 'friendly', 'new', 'viewers', 'then', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'either.I', 'have', 'bit', 'conflicting', 'feelings', 'movie', 'one', 'side', 'think', 'was', 'worthy', 'end', 'series', 'was', 'dramatic', 'grandiose', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'did', 'feel', 'bit', 'tame', 'here', 'there', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'sort', 'had', 'hoped', 'more', 'Part', '2', 'fetch', 'quest', 'last', 'movie', 'then', 'fantasy', 'war', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'do', 'keep', 'nice', 'balance', 'action', 'drama', 'character', 'development', 'major', 'character', 'get', 'change', 'shine', 'none', 'left', 'forgotten', 'conclusion', 'feel', 'satisfying', 'many', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'have', 'one', 'continuous', 'story', 'do', 'properly', 'end', 'Now', 'say', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'good', 'end', 'sort', 'feel', 'bit', 'watered', 'down', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'days', 'put', 'finger', 'what', 'exactly', 'mean', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'When', 'watching', 'other', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'was', 'completely', 'enthralled', 'forgot', 'popcorn', 'anything', 'else', 'duration', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', 'mattered', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'part', '2', 'was', 'engaging', 'not', 'degree', 'time', 'found', 'thinking', 'other', 'things', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'thinking', 'hum', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'end', 'series', 'something', 'missing.Perhaps', 'what', 'am', 'looking', 'movie', 'felt', 'polished', 'was', 'good', 'dark', 'gritty', 'times', 'had', 'cover', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'such', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'lacked', 'litter', 'quirks', 'character', 'interactions', 'made', 'other', 'movies', 'feel', 'real', 'when', 'characters', 'did', 'interact', 'felt', 'much', 'more', 'scripted', 'So', 'much', 'later', 'half', 'movie', 'depend', 'viewer', 'caring', 'what', 'characters', 'part', 'felt', 'bit', 'other', 'complaint', 'have', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'part', '2', 'music', 'great', 'effects', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'other', 'theatrical', 'details', 'great', 'director', 'have', 'had', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'have', 'spent', 'wisely', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hollows', 'Part', '2', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'think', 'perhaps', 'last', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'parted', 'three', 'rather', 'two', 'parts', 'give', 'director', 'more', 'time', 'let', 'story', 'develop', 'time', 'alloted', 'format', 'think', 'everyone', 'involved', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'series', 'however', 'are', 'newcomer', 'series', 'go', 'back', 'start', 'first', 'movie', 'watch', 'order.It', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'series', 'get', 'worthy', 'end', 'worthy', 'end', 'do', 'provide', 'proper', 'payoff', 'seeing', 'other', 'movies', 'series', 'round', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'who', 'do', 'have', 'flaws', 'who', 'really', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'fantastic', 'story']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

It wanted me to download and install a completely separate application onto my computer.  To be honest, I'm not sure how it works in the end because I didn't download the application.

I have nothing but admiration for the creative mind of the author--well a little jealousy too perhaps.This was a great finale to a fine series of books and films.  While I was very disappointed in Part I, which was essentially a gorgeously filmed travelogue, and almost didn't go to Part II because of it, I'm glad I broke down and did. I'm still confused as to why they didn't get to the point and just do Deathly Hallows as a single film.  I assume the Deathlyl Hallows was going to be hideously expensive to make, and a less expensive Part I would help defray the cost of the whole without making the film prohibitively expensive to audience.  You saw Deathly Hallows on the installment plan so-to-speak!Part II is essentially a very ""dark"" film, both cinematically and metaphorically, but it brings about a d&eacute;nouement that has been building up for almost a decade.  The film follows the book closely with just a slight alteration in the role of the Snape character.  This was totally acceptable in my opinion, since although I could understand both his behavior and his motivation, I wasn't always certain that the books themselves made either very clear to the reader.  One had to do a lot of reading between the lines, which for an adult was not that difficult, but which for younger readers might have been.  I think it was important, because it revealed yet again that one cannot always assume one knows what's going on beyond the surface that people present to us.  I think it was also a good source of character development for Harry, since he came to understand at the moment of the man's death, that his life had been lived in almost constant sacrifice for the love of Harry's mother and for Harry himself.  It was a beautiful and well played role, and I think Alan Rickman deserves public acknowledgment for creating it so superbly.As usual for a ""good versus evil"" film, there are deaths of a number of familiar characters, but that happens in any war.  In fact the entire build up to the event would have seemed familiar to those who grew up before WWI and fought during it, and definitely to those who grew up to fight in WWII.  Likewise, characters that had been taken rather lightly as children grew up to take a far more active and dedicated role in these events than their friends would have expected or even they themselves might have predicted.  Even characters who had been considered evil, who may even have been evil at the moment, stepped up to the plate when it became obvious that no one could stand on the sidelines and expect to come out of the fray unaffected.  Nor were acts of courage, sacrifice, or kindness forgotten.  Wonderful lessons.A great climax to a beloved series.",5,Great finale,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,2859,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'English', 'three', 'French', 'seen', 'films', 'up', 'one', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'immensely', 'have', 'nothing', 'admiration', 'creative', 'mind', 'author', 'well', 'little', 'jealousy', 'too', 'perhaps.This', 'was', 'great', 'finale', 'fine', 'series', 'books', 'films', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Part', 'was', 'essentially', 'gorgeously', 'filmed', 'travelogue', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'Part', 'II', ""'m"", 'glad', 'broke', 'down', 'did', ""'m"", 'still', 'confused', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'point', 'just', 'do', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'single', 'film', 'assume', 'Deathlyl', 'Hallows', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'hideously', 'expensive', 'make', 'less', 'expensive', 'Part', 'would', 'help', 'defray', 'cost', 'whole', 'making', 'film', 'prohibitively', 'expensive', 'audience', 'saw', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'installment', 'plan', 'so-to-speak', 'Part', 'II', 'essentially', 'very', 'dark', 'film', 'cinematically', 'metaphorically', 'd', 'eacute', 'nouement', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'almost', 'decade', 'film', 'book', 'closely', 'just', 'slight', 'alteration', 'role', 'Snape', 'character', 'was', 'totally', 'acceptable', 'opinion', 'could', 'understand', 'behavior', 'motivation', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'certain', 'books', 'made', 'very', 'clear', 'reader', 'One', 'had', 'do', 'lot', 'reading', 'lines', 'adult', 'was', 'not', 'difficult', 'younger', 'readers', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'think', 'was', 'important', 'revealed', 'yet', 'again', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'assume', 'one', 'what', 'going', 'surface', 'people', 'present', 'think', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'source', 'character', 'development', 'Harry', 'came', 'understand', 'moment', 'man', 'death', 'life', 'had', 'been', 'lived', 'almost', 'constant', 'sacrifice', 'love', 'Harry', 'mother', 'Harry', 'was', 'beautiful', 'well', 'played', 'role', 'think', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'public', 'acknowledgment', 'creating', 'so', 'superbly.As', 'usual', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'film', 'are', 'deaths', 'number', 'familiar', 'characters', 'war', 'fact', 'entire', 'build', 'event', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'familiar', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'WWI', 'fought', 'definitely', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'fight', 'WWII', 'Likewise', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'rather', 'lightly', 'children', 'grew', 'up', 'take', 'far', 'more', 'active', 'dedicated', 'role', 'events', 'friends', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'even', 'might', 'have', 'predicted', 'Even', 'characters', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'considered', 'evil', 'who', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'evil', 'moment', 'stepped', 'up', 'plate', 'when', 'became', 'obvious', 'one', 'could', 'stand', 'sidelines', 'expect', 'come', 'fray', 'unaffected', 'were', 'acts', 'courage', 'sacrifice', 'kindness', 'forgotten', 'Wonderful', 'lessons.A', 'great', 'climax', 'beloved', 'series']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

Of course if you have not seen the earlier movies, it's probably a good idea if you do that first, at least Deathly Hallows Part 1.As the story opens, Hogwarts is surrounded by Dementers, and Snape is now the headmaster. The place has changed enormously, of course. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) realizes that the last horcrux must be at Hogwarts, and returns there to find it. What he finds, of course, is a huge amount of trouble.Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are with him, of course, and as soon as they manage to sneak into Hogwarts, they find that Dumbledore's Army is ready to fight. Which is good, because Voldemort is amassing a huge army of death eaters just outside the grounds.It's a magnificent battle, and I won't ruin a thing by telling you any details. Eventually, of course, it comes down to Harry versus Voldemort mano a mano. But first we have the revelations involved in Snape's final tears. Harry collects them and, on Snape's instructions, pours them into the pensieve. What he discovers there is the key to winning the battle against Voldemort.For the romantically minded, there's an epilogue 19 years later, where we get to see what couples are now sending their children to Hogwarts.

Even though the film's over 2 hours long, it actually feels much MUCH shorter.  Perhaps because it's so compelling and I was caught up in the characters knowing this would be the last time I'd get to see them.The action is mainly focused around or inside the castle and all the havic and chaos that follows (which is a lot- especially related to the gang running from face-covered fireballs and the numerous mighty impressive explosions).Perhaps the only complaint is that the final boss fight isn't as epic as it could have been.  Without spoiling what happens, when Harry is supposedly deceased and someone else takes over the castle and the land, a battle then occurs that's good but not *great*.  It's not great because it lacks a sufficient amount of suspense and should have been stretched 10 minutes longer.  I don't know, after 10 years of the Harry Potter films, I believe it's fair for viewers to demand a more satisfying boss fight.  Still it's definitely good enough.When Harry enters a spiritual world of mist and haze, this entire segment is totally beautiful and offers great storytelling.  This and that one fireball chasing segment are highlights for me.  The amount of beautiful magic is a satisfying continuation from Deathly Hallows Part 1.Overall, the VERY end of the movie makes me cry and the rest of the film is really good too.

They manage to break out by freeing a dragon guardian. Their next move leads them back to Hogwarts where another is hidden.In their return, Severus Snape, the new headmaster faces and loses a challenge to Professor McGonnagal and is driven from the castle. In the meantime, Voldemort chooses to attack the castle and while those that can fight prepare for the battle, Harry talks to the Grey Lady to find the next horcrux.

Hermione and Ron appear and a battle ensues and Crabbe sets the room magically afire, dying when the fire he cast goes out of control. Draco and Goyle are trapped,and Harry and Ron manages to save them both as they flee from the room on brooms.

This was the best, most uplifting chapter of the entire series.  With Voldermort's final death Harry is mobbed by friends, students, parents, teachers all in absolute joy.  I  can't imagine why this was rewritten for the movie.  Instead, the final showdown was an extended action sequence of the two alone, dueling without witnesses.  And when Harry emerges triumphant, there is no outpouring of joy and congratulations, only dejected faces.  We're not even sure anyone is aware that Voldermont is dead as it's never mentioned.  What a terrible disservice to J.K. Rowlands book.I have no complaint in regard to the UltraViolet Digital Copy as I have no idea what that is but I felt terribly let down by the ending of the movie.  I'm at a complete loss as to why, when the rest of the movie followed the book somewhat well, the final showdown was rewritten to avoid the triumphant victory expressed so well in the book.

This yound wizard, whose name is Harry Potter, has grown in so many people's hearts and now this DVD will show his final battle between him and Lord Voldemort. It is the final showdown and, as we all know, only one will survive. I read the books and went to the theatre and I was still surprised at how this movie was presented. The director did a wonderful job. The entire cast was there, along with some new faces. I left the theatre in tears because it is the last Harry Potter film and I am sure that I am not alone. Maybe Hollywood will find a way to make another Harry Potter film one day (maybe a prequel?)Anyway, the wait is over. Complete your collection today. I am sure that one day the manufactorer of these DVDs will make one ultimate package of all the DVDs, but that will surely be really expensive.Just think about how rich J.K. Rowling is.I am surely going to be watching this movie again and again. I truly only wish it was not the end of the Harry Potter films. Daniel Radcliff (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ronald Weasley), and Emma Watson (Hermoine Granger) all return along with many, many others!This is a finale worth seeing, even if you are not a Harry Potter fan. If you just like Sci-fi movies, this is your movie too. This movie touches on romance, drama, action, adventure, and comedy in some ways. This movie is a steal at $17.99 because you know the stores will want more. Order yours now, complete your adventure with Harry Potter and when you do finish this movie, head on over to Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. Why? In Islands of Adventure, they have a Harry Potter ride. It will not be there forever, so go a.s.a.p.This is the last time you can order a Harry Potter DVD. What are you waiting for?

1241186,A2NJRBJFBTF54A,B001UV4XIS,Charles Camp,"[0, 1]","I really wanted to like this movie. While the Harry Potter film franchise has never fully convinced me that it is capable of producing movies with any true lasting value, it has at least always spawned reasonably good films that, despite their missteps, are mostly enjoyable and entertaining on an initial viewing. However, the unbelievably excellent reviews for this movie really had me expecting something more this time. I was hoping to finally see a Harry Potter film that wasn't just serviceable and entertaining, but was truly a great film in terms of storytelling, pacing, craft, and execution.Sadly, I feel the final Harry Potter film falls victim to the exact same missteps that have plagued the series throughout its production. Sure, there are a number of things that this film does very well. The special effects are absolutely through the roof, the atmosphere and camerawork are suitably dark and ominous, and there a few very emotionally potent scenes, such as Snape's death and the discovery that Harry makes about his past soon after. Yet the core elements necessary for the foundation of the film are simply lacking, almost absent in certain cases. The interplay between the characters, all of whom we are supposed to be emotionally invested in and cheering for, seems oddly muted. There is a distinct lack of emotional interplay between characters at times when these emotions seem like they should be at their greatest. The moment where Ron and Hermione realize that Harry has decided to sacrifice himself to Voldemort feels extremely underplayed. They barely even try to stop him and seem extremely ready and willing to make peace with the fact that their best friend of 7 years has decided he must die. Also, when Harry magically resurrects himself from the dead (still trying to figure that one out.. the way it is presented in the film is quite confusing), he doesn't receive the reception that you would assume he would. His companions respond almost as if they expected him to come back to life all long.However, I feel the biggest and most damning issue with the film is the pacing and storytelling technique, especially in the latter portion after Harry is killed. The movie seems to speed hastily through the moments that require the most attention and should be the most emotionally resonant, while dwelling on and extending other scenes beyond their welcome. This absolutely kills the narrative drive of the movie, pulling you out of the action and lessening the scale and the potential emotional impact of the proceedings. The scene after Harry dies and where he meets Dumbledore is obviously a pivotal scene, but the length that it extends through coupled with its positioning squarely at the climax of the movie detracts from the flow and suspense. On the other hand, the scene that this entire decade's worth of movies has been building to where Harry and Voldemort finally clash is treated in an almost business-like fashion. The fight itself feels a bit hasty, but the real problem is that there is no emotional resolution after Voldemort is finally killed. None of the characters even mention or react to what has transpired. This is an absolutely unforgivable misstep because it undermines the entire event, as well as the 7 previous movies that have led to it. There is no emotional culmination and/or resolution with any of the characters after the evil they have been fighting for so long has finally been vanquished. Instead, we are led straight to the epilogue in less than 10 minutes with hardly a line of dialogue from anyone other than Harry, Ron, or Hermione, none of whom have anything to discuss except for details concerning the Elder Wand. The sense of accomplishment, gratification, resolution, or relief seems entirely absent.At the end of the day though, this is not a horrible movie. It certainly has a number of entertaining scenes and, like the films that came before it, is mostly entertaining and relatively solid. However, it falls victim to the same narrative-driven problems that the other films suffer from and, in this case, the missteps are particularly unforgivable given that this film is the final installment and the one where emotional resonance and correct pacing is the most vital. For that reason, although it is probably one of the better films in the series, I can't give it more than 2 stars. Admittedly, it feels a tad low, but the flaws are simply too significant to be overlooked and they fatally wound what could've been a satisfying conclusion to a relatively solid franchise.",2,Falls victim to the same missteps that have always plagued this series.,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,4557,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'franchise', 'never', 'fully', 'convinced', 'capable', 'producing', 'movies', 'true', 'lasting', 'value', 'least', 'always', 'spawned', 'reasonably', 'good', 'films', 'missteps', 'are', 'mostly', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'initial', 'viewing', 'However', 'unbelievably', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'movie', 'really', 'had', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'hoping', 'finally', 'see', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'serviceable', 'entertaining', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'terms', 'storytelling', 'pacing', 'craft', 'execution.Sadly', 'feel', 'final', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'victim', 'exact', 'same', 'missteps', 'have', 'plagued', 'series', 'production', 'Sure', 'are', 'number', 'things', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'absolutely', 'roof', 'atmosphere', 'camerawork', 'are', 'suitably', 'dark', 'ominous', 'there', 'few', 'very', 'emotionally', 'potent', 'scenes', 'such', 'Snape', 'death', 'discovery', 'Harry', 'past', 'soon', 'core', 'elements', 'necessary', 'foundation', 'film', 'are', 'simply', 'lacking', 'almost', 'absent', 'certain', 'cases', 'interplay', 'characters', 'whom', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'cheering', 'oddly', 'muted', 'distinct', 'lack', 'emotional', 'interplay', 'characters', 'times', 'when', 'emotions', 'seem', 'should', 'be', 'greatest', 'moment', 'where', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'realize', 'Harry', 'decided', 'sacrifice', 'Voldemort', 'feels', 'extremely', 'underplayed', 'barely', 'even', 'try', 'stop', 'seem', 'extremely', 'ready', 'willing', 'make', 'peace', 'fact', 'best', 'friend', '7', 'years', 'decided', 'must', 'die', 'Also', 'when', 'Harry', 'magically', 'dead', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'one', 'out..', 'way', 'presented', 'film', 'quite', 'confusing', ""n't"", 'receive', 'reception', 'would', 'assume', 'would', 'companions', 'respond', 'almost', 'expected', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'long.However', 'feel', 'biggest', 'most', 'damning', 'issue', 'film', 'pacing', 'storytelling', 'technique', 'especially', 'latter', 'portion', 'Harry', 'killed', 'movie', 'speed', 'hastily', 'moments', 'require', 'most', 'attention', 'should', 'be', 'most', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'dwelling', 'extending', 'other', 'scenes', 'welcome', 'absolutely', 'narrative', 'drive', 'movie', 'pulling', 'action', 'lessening', 'scale', 'potential', 'emotional', 'impact', 'proceedings', 'scene', 'Harry', 'dies', 'where', 'Dumbledore', 'obviously', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'length', 'coupled', 'positioning', 'squarely', 'climax', 'movie', 'flow', 'suspense', 'other', 'hand', 'scene', 'entire', 'decade', 'worth', 'movies', 'been', 'building', 'where', 'Harry', 'Voldemort', 'finally', 'treated', 'almost', 'business-like', 'fashion', 'fight', 'bit', 'hasty', 'real', 'problem', 'emotional', 'resolution', 'Voldemort', 'finally', 'killed', 'None', 'characters', 'even', 'mention', 'react', 'what', 'transpired', 'absolutely', 'unforgivable', 'misstep', 'entire', 'event', 'as', 'well', '7', 'previous', 'movies', 'have', 'led', 'emotional', 'culmination', 'resolution', 'characters', 'evil', 'have', 'been', 'fighting', 'so', 'long', 'finally', 'been', 'vanquished', 'Instead', 'are', 'led', 'straight', 'epilogue', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'hardly', 'line', 'dialogue', 'anyone', 'other', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'none', 'whom', 'have', 'anything', 'discuss', 'details', 'concerning', 'Elder', 'Wand', 'sense', 'accomplishment', 'gratification', 'resolution', 'relief', 'entirely', 'absent.At', 'end', 'day', 'not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'certainly', 'number', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'films', 'came', 'mostly', 'entertaining', 'relatively', 'solid', 'However', 'victim', 'same', 'narrative-driven', 'problems', 'other', 'films', 'suffer', 'case', 'missteps', 'are', 'particularly', 'unforgivable', 'given', 'film', 'final', 'installment', 'one', 'where', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'correct', 'pacing', 'most', 'vital', 'reason', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', '2', 'stars', 'Admittedly', 'tad', 'low', 'flaws', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'significant', 'be', 'overlooked', 'fatally', 'wound', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'relatively', 'solid', 'franchise']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

Even though Part 2 did diverge from the ending of the book, the reason its getting the rating I'm giving it is becuz I do apperciate what everyone working to give us the great stories that came off the books. The books didn't do the movies justice, but I enjoyed watching them and watching Dan Radcliffe portraying Harry going from a once small innocent boy to a slightly grizzled man, and a wonderfull one at that. I do appreciate what he did for the series, and in my opinion, he has proven that he was the right guy to play Harry Potter over the last decade. I hope that this movie does get Academy Award recognition becuz I believe Part 2 truely deserves it! So long Harry, Ron, and Hermione!

1241193,AN9J46667D80O,B001UV4XIS,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[6, 10]","And so here we are, the end of the line. After 10 years and billions of dollars in ticket sales, much critical acclaim and millions upon million of people entertained, we have the final installment in the Harry Potter saga. Is it everything the fans could hope for?Basically, yes.The film picks up where last year's film, the aptly-named Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, left off. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson), are all hiding out at a beach house. Dobby the house elf has died and been buried. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), is dead (and despite that state, he still gets more to do here than he did in the recent Doctor Who Christmas special), Snape (Alan Rickman), is in charge of Hogwart's, and Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), is on the rise. All is grim and doom for our heroes.But in typical Potter fashion, Harry doesn't take it lying down. He bribes one of the Gringott's goblins (Warwick Davis, playing one of his two roles in this movie), to help him and his friends get a sword from the vault. This launches them back into the fight and in quick order they've dealt with a dragon, defended Hogwart's (with no small number of deaths on both sides), and everyone, especially Harry, has grown and changed.I really liked that everyone had something to do in this story. Ron and Hermione get their own little adventure getting a basilisk fang, Snape gets the most character development he's had in the entire series (and proves that, in many ways, he's the real hero of the stories, not Harry), Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith, who would make an excellent Granny Weatherwax, should those books ever get made into movies), organizes the Hogwarts defenses in a battle that includes most of the best actors in the UK, including Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, David Thewliss and Miriam Margolyes (who would make an excellent Nanny Ogg, should those books ever get made into movies). Even Draco gets something to do, and proves that he's not an evil little thing like he's been set up to be in the past.For those of us who were at all concerned that the producers might pull a few punches in order to keep this a ""kids"" movie, worry not. The level of death and destruction is quite high. Everyone that I can recall dying in the book, dies here, some in more spectacular ways than others. The film also does a great job of sustaining an atmosphere of dread and fear, eventually leading to... well, you know what it leads to. Frankly, the make-up job in the end scene got several laughs in my theater, though I thought it was just fine.I also appreciated the fact that, frankly, this movie flowed better than the book. Much as I liked the novel, it was, as I've mentioned before, a bit of Harry Potter and the Endless Camping Trip. Here there's none of that. I think the producers made an excellent choice in breaking this up into two separate films. It really benefited the material.This is usually the part of the review where I say, ""Not everything is perfect,"" but really I can't think of a single thing to complain about. I would definitely recommend against seeing this in 3-D, for what that's worth. All you're going to get is a darker, washed-out version of a movie that already has a fairly dark palette. Don't cheat yourself like that.The Harry Potter movies and books have been a real cultural triumph and the fact that even the weakest among them have still been better than much of what's out there is no small accomplishment.

1241205,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B001UV4XIS,C. Sawin,"[2, 4]","I was never a big Harry Potter fan. I didn't read the books and only saw The Prisoner of Azkaban in theaters at the time because I was bored one weekend. So I had pretty much gone all this time without seeing the other movies in their entirety. With a screening of The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 quickly approaching, I took the initiative to watch the first seven movies over the course of a few days to be prepared and I'm very glad that I did. The movies do in fact get darker as you progress through them and seem to get better with each sequel. The one thing I didn't like was that The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix, and The Half-Blood Prince all have similar endings that just leave you hanging. One of the main characters, usually Harry, blurts out something like, ""We're going to have to go do this,"" and then there's this long, winding panoramic shot before the credits roll and that's it. However, watching all the movies at once had me at a bit of an advantage since there wasn't much of a wait between movies. Everyone has their favorite Harry Potter movie and I'm still a bit partial to The Prisoner of Azkaban but in my opinion both halves of The Deathly Hallows are the best in the series.I'm not entirely sure if it was just following so close to the book or what, but The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 has an excellent sense of perspective. Hermione holding a stray hair and the scene at the bank where the guard begins to suspect Harry, Ron, and Hermione to be imposters are the prime examples that come to mind. The way it drew attention to certain items or characters through the use of those things being in-focus while everything else around them was out of focus just really made a simple scene so much more interesting. It made you try and take notice of the surroundings a bit more since they seemed to be just as important as what the main characters were going through at times.The special effects are extremely impressive, as well. The war at Hogwarts and Harry's battle with Voldemort are probably the most substantial scenes that come to mind while the death eaters always use some fairly eye-catching effects, but I found the white dragon to be the crown jewel of the special effects department. Most of the extravagant creatures that have played an important role in the series have generally looked the best (Buckbeak and Thestrals come to mind) compared to some of the other computer generated effects in the franchise. The white dragon in The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 just looks really spectacular though. It didn't look like it was obviously created on a computer like many computer generated effects seem to and almost came off as being flesh and bone or at least as realistic as a dragon could be.Does a film like this have any weaknesses? Probably, but they'll mostly go unnoticed. That's not necessarily a bad thing either. You'll be so caught up in watching this ten year event come to an end and piecing together those final pieces of the puzzle that if there is anything wrong with this finale you won't even notice. I've always felt that it always looked kind of funky whenever somebody rode a broomstick. At times it looks great and just as it should, but at others it just didn't look right. It looked a bit off in this one, but it's so brief that it should hardly even count as a nitpick.I feel like amongst all of the adventures you've tagged along for with Harry, Ron, and Hermione and all of the characters and creatures they've come into contact with in the span of eight films that Snape is still easily the most intriguing aspect of the entire story. His agenda is certainly something worth paying attention to and the way everything he does falls into place after you learn what you do about him in this movie is something really extraordinary. That isn't to say that other characters don't have their moments because they do, but Professor Severus Snape is that unexpected adhesive that brings all of the films together and gives the entire franchise an even greater meaning.Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is essentially everything you want it to be and that's more than a satisfying conclusion for all Harry Potter fans big and small. The special effects are fantastic and the cast is at the top of their game. It's intense and gripping while part of you will want to see this film last forever.

1241216,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B001UV4XIS,David A. Wend,"[1, 3]","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a rousing conclusion to the cycle of films. I have not read the books (I'll start soon if I can work through my stack of books) so my review has to do with the film alone. The three principles in the story - Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson - demonstrate the acting skills that they have picked up over the years and turn in good performances.  The Amazon review noted that there was a lack of chemistry between Harry and Ginny Weasley but there had very little screen time and their characters seems to have taken a back seat to the struggle to defeat Vorldemort and the destruction of the remaining Horcruxes.  The film nicely expresses the ideas of teamwork, friendship, and courage of the wizards battling the forces of evil. .It was great to see the many characters played by so many veteran British actors, even if they had only a single scene. John Hurt had a memorable scene describing the characters of different wands and Maggie Smith had a courageous scene displacing Professor Snape as the Headmaster of Hogwarts.  Alan Rickman has a small but effective role in the film and we finally learn Severus Snape's turn feelings toward Harry Potter with his relationship to his mother.  In the end, Snape is the hero that one suspected in watching the films. It would be interesting if J. K. Rowling would write about the generation before Harry, as there is a compelling story to be told.The final installment of Harry Potter is filled with marvelous special effects, particularly the dragon guarding the vault of in Bellatrix Lestrange labyrinth of Gringotts Bank.  There are some humorous scenes as when Emma Watson impersonates Lestrange with the help of Polly Juice Potion. The only part of the story that was somewhat inexplicable was Harry's death and being brought back to life.  How the Resurrection Stone was used was rather mysterious.  One can't help enjoying the scene where the once timid Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) defies Voldemort.  The epilogue was a nice touch so we could see how enemies had reconciled and life goes on in a new generation.The final installment of Harry Potter is a memorable film that one can enjoy several times.",5,It All Ends in a Terrific Conclusion,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,2224,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '2', 'rousing', 'conclusion', 'cycle', 'films', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', ""'ll"", 'start', 'soon', 'can', 'work', 'stack', 'books', 'review', 'do', 'film', 'alone', 'three', 'principles', 'story', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'demonstrate', 'acting', 'skills', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'years', 'turn', 'good', 'performances', 'Amazon', 'review', 'noted', 'was', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Harry', 'Ginny', 'Weasley', 'there', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'characters', 'have', 'taken', 'back', 'seat', 'struggle', 'defeat', 'Vorldemort', 'destruction', 'remaining', 'Horcruxes', 'film', 'nicely', 'ideas', 'teamwork', 'friendship', 'courage', 'wizards', 'battling', 'forces', 'evil', '.It', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'many', 'characters', 'played', 'so', 'many', 'veteran', 'British', 'actors', 'even', 'had', 'only', 'single', 'scene', 'John', 'Hurt', 'had', 'memorable', 'scene', 'describing', 'characters', 'different', 'wands', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'had', 'courageous', 'scene', 'displacing', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'Headmaster', 'Hogwarts', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'small', 'effective', 'role', 'film', 'finally', 'learn', 'Severus', 'Snape', 'turn', 'feelings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'relationship', 'mother', 'end', 'Snape', 'hero', 'one', 'suspected', 'watching', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'J.', 'K.', 'Rowling', 'would', 'write', 'generation', 'Harry', 'compelling', 'story', 'be', 'told.The', 'final', 'installment', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'filled', 'marvelous', 'special', 'effects', 'particularly', 'dragon', 'guarding', 'vault', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'labyrinth', 'Gringotts', 'Bank', 'are', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'when', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Lestrange', 'help', 'Polly', 'Juice', 'Potion', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'somewhat', 'inexplicable', 'was', 'Harry', 'death', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'How', 'Resurrection', 'Stone', 'was', 'used', 'was', 'rather', 'mysterious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoying', 'scene', 'where', 'once', 'timid', 'Neville', 'Longbottom', 'Matthew', 'Lewis', 'Voldemort', 'epilogue', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'enemies', 'had', 'reconciled', 'life', 'new', 'generation.The', 'final', 'installment', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'memorable', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'enjoy', 'several', 'times']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

I didn't, and I didn't have a photographic memory of the last film, so I was a little confused in the beginning (Sword of Gryffindor?  Oh yeah--Dobby died.  Where'd that wandmaker come from?), but that's okay.  I wouldn't have wanted them to waste valuable screen time rehashing all that.Where the last film gave our heroes some much needed quiet time before the storm, this film is a series of special effects set pieces.  There are so many loose ends to tie up and so many characters to bid farewell that the screenplay begins to resemble a checklist at times.  Some of the characters receive very short shrift, but that can't be helped.  The filmmakers didn't have the luxury of an unlimited running time, as J.K. Rowling did when she wrote her book.  This barrage of magical artifacts and familiar faces had the unfortunate result of making none of it feel particularly important, but the film still worked for me because the friendship between our three heroes remained firmly in the foreground.  So I was satisfied with the conclusion of their story even though I wasn't much concerned with the fate of each Magical Whatsit and I was underwhelmed by the final showdown with Lord Voldemort.

Both sound and picture are good and contribute to the telling of the story.I've now watched all three discs and downloaded the movie to my computer and it all worked just fine. The download is a formidable 2 GB's and takes a few minutes on a cable connection but it downloaded and played back.The download instructions tell you that Flixster and Adobe Air must be installed on your computer and automatically starts the process if those two programs aren't already on your computer. I didn't have either of them so I had to download and install them after which I downloaded the movie. The movie is now downloaded to my computer and plays back through the Flixster software; I've played the first few minutes and it seems to be going well.When I first tried the Blu-ray disc my player (OPPO BDP83-SE) froze and wouldn't do anything; I had to cut the power to the player then restarted the player, ejected the disc and then reinserted it at which time it played perfectly. I have no idea why it froze the first time and played perfectly the second time. Since then I've played the DVD version and replayed the Blu-ray version as well as the Special Features disc all with no problem.The movie is based on the book, not a movie version of the book; having said that I think the movie version has merit which can be enjoyed for what it is even though it varies from the book's version of the story. All of the key elements of the book's version are there but just packaged to get there by different routes. In her conversation with Daniel Radcliffe, J.K. Rowling makes some comments on the differences between her book version and the movie version; the movie's version of the story obviously had the author's apporval.The Special Features disc included some excellent resources including a conversation between Daniel Radcliffe and J.K. Rowling. This conversation provides some fascinating background on the writing of the books and the making of the movies. If you have an interest in the franchise this is a conversation you don't want to miss; J.K. Rowing explains a lot of her thinking that was influential in the production of the movie and the writing of the stories.Normally I don't download movies that I have on Blu-ray to my computer; in this case I made an exception because of the various comments from other reviewers. I was really curious how it would work out with Flixster and the downloaded version of the movie. So far so good; I'll set aside some time to watch the entire movie on my computer and if anything noteworthy occurs I'll update this review. One thing I did notice was when I stopped the movie and later went back to it the movie started again at the beginning, not the point where I stopped it.On balance I think the movie is effective, powerful and even has some touching moments; those who appreciate the characters involved in the story will probably find the movie well worth their time.",5,A Rewarding Three Disc Package,1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,3291,"['movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'version', 'book', 'easily', 'held', 'attention', 'way', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'menacing', 'story', 'Harry', 'final', 'battle', 'Voldemort', 'exciting', 'fashion', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'Epilogue', 'Nineteen', 'Years', 'Later', 'faithfully', 'presented', 'end', 'movie', 'book', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'good', 'contribute', 'telling', 'story.I', ""'ve"", 'now', 'watched', 'three', 'discs', 'downloaded', 'movie', 'computer', 'worked', 'just', 'fine', 'download', 'formidable', '2', 'GB', 'few', 'minutes', 'cable', 'connection', 'downloaded', 'played', 'back.The', 'download', 'instructions', 'tell', 'Flixster', 'Adobe', 'Air', 'must', 'be', 'installed', 'computer', 'automatically', 'process', 'two', 'programs', 'are', ""n't"", 'already', 'computer', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'so', 'had', 'download', 'install', 'downloaded', 'movie', 'movie', 'now', 'downloaded', 'computer', 'back', 'Flixster', 'software', ""'ve"", 'played', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'be', 'going', 'first', 'tried', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'player', 'OPPO', 'BDP83-SE', 'froze', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'had', 'cut', 'power', 'player', 'then', 'restarted', 'player', 'ejected', 'disc', 'then', 'reinserted', 'time', 'played', 'perfectly', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'froze', 'first', 'time', 'played', 'perfectly', 'second', 'time', 'then', ""'ve"", 'played', 'DVD', 'version', 'replayed', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'Special', 'Features', 'disc', 'problem.The', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'not', 'movie', 'version', 'book', 'having', 'said', 'think', 'movie', 'version', 'merit', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'even', 'book', 'version', 'story', 'key', 'elements', 'book', 'version', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'packaged', 'get', 'there', 'different', 'routes', 'conversation', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'comments', 'differences', 'book', 'version', 'movie', 'version', 'movie', 'version', 'story', 'obviously', 'had', 'author', 'apporval.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'disc', 'included', 'excellent', 'resources', 'including', 'conversation', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'conversation', 'fascinating', 'background', 'writing', 'books', 'making', 'movies', 'have', 'interest', 'franchise', 'conversation', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'J.K.', 'Rowing', 'lot', 'thinking', 'was', 'influential', 'production', 'movie', 'writing', 'stories.Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'download', 'movies', 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'computer', 'case', 'made', 'exception', 'various', 'comments', 'other', 'reviewers', 'was', 'really', 'curious', 'how', 'would', 'work', 'out', 'Flixster', 'downloaded', 'version', 'movie', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', ""'ll"", 'set', 'aside', 'time', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'computer', 'anything', 'noteworthy', ""'ll"", 'update', 'review', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'notice', 'was', 'when', 'stopped', 'movie', 'later', 'went', 'back', 'movie', 'started', 'again', 'beginning', 'not', 'point', 'where', 'stopped', 'it.On', 'balance', 'think', 'movie', 'effective', 'powerful', 'even', 'touching', 'moments', 'who', 'appreciate', 'characters', 'involved', 'story', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'movie', 'well', 'time']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

1241231,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B001UV4XIS,Deborah Earle,"[0, 1]","There was a boy... A very strange enchanted boy....And for ten years, the world watched Daniel Radcliffe inhabit the role of J.K. Rowling's formidable young literary hero, taking him from a sweet, wide-eyed waif, just beginning to learn about his past and find his unique place in a world previously unknown to him for most of his life to a complex young man with increasing skill and courage, as well as a very noble character as he comes closer and closer to his final ""High Noon"" moment with the Dark Lord(Ralph Fiennes), who has unsuccessfully tried to kill him since he was a year old.The final film begins where the penultimate one left off... With Voldemort(whose name means ""Fly of Death"") re-activating the Elder Wand, and Harry, Ron(Rupert Grint) and Hermione(Emma Watson, whose attractive heart-shaped visage is in dramatic contrast to the plump bisque-doll face  she had in the first film) grieve the loss of Dobby(Toby Jones), while inside the Weasley Family beach house, used as a safehouse by remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, Bill and Fleur Weasley(Domhall Gleeson and Clemence Poesy) tend to wandseller, Mr. Ollivander(John Hurt), the goblin, Griphook(Warwick Davis), and Luna Lovegood(Evanna Lynch).In speaking with Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione learn why Bellatrix Lestrange(Helena Bonham Carter) with whom Hermione and Griphook had especially brutal encounters at Malfoy Manor, thought the Sword of Griffyndor should be in her vault at Gringott's Bank(where Griphook worked), and learn of the possibility of finding another horcrux there.Having acquired a strand of Bellatrix's hair, Hermione uses it in polyjuice potion to disguise herself as Voldemort's female counterpart  before she, Ron(who will also be incognito), Harry and Griphook disapparate to Gringott's to search for the items. Harry and Griphook travel beneath Harry's invisibility cloak, and Ron blasts an elixir to with the favor of a goblin banker to help reach their destination. They bypass a sleeping dragon , which guards the vault, but the geminal curse, in which everything they touch multiplies, results  in an overabundance of silver cups just like the desired horcrux appearing, nearly burying them. In a scene vindicating Hagrid's(Robbie Coltrane) warning about goblins being clever but unfriendly during Harry's first year at Hogwarts, Griphook pulls a double cross as the guards close in on them  with wands blazing, leading Hermione to come up with a daring escape plan via the dragon guarding the vaults, demolishing the front area of the bank and incinerating some of the bankers who were unable to flee. Unlike the book, Griphook's fate is better defined in the film as the sword of Griffyndor, his desired reward for helping the three teens get into the vault, disappears from his grasp.At the risk of being seen by Muggles, the three fly away from London on the back of the newly released dragon, dropping into a lake as the wyvern flies away. During their submersion, Harry's scar burns and he has telltale seizures and visions. As they climb ashore, he tells Ron and Hermione that Voldemort knows their whereabouts and is scared and angry, and that he has also seen  the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw (Kelly MacDonald), and surmised that the next horcrux may be found at Hogwarts, and that it has something to do with Ravenclaw Tower. Ron reminds him that Snape(Alan Rickman) in now Headmaster and they'll have to find an alternate entrance into the school. Harry reminds Hermione of how their plans always go awry when she recommends taking time to strategize slowly.Disapparating from a green area to the snowy village of Hogsmeade, they narrowly escape snatchers as Alberforth Dumbledore(Ciaran Hinds), who had sent Dobby to rescue them from Malfoy Manor, gives them refuge in the tavern he tends and advises them against an exercise in futility in hunting for more horcruxes. Harry disagrees with Alberforth, and his show of determination leads Alberforth to speak to his dead sister, Arianna's(Hebe Beardshall)portrait. The schoolgirl walks mysteriously into the background, and then returns with someone, who, as the door behind the portrait opens, is revealed to be Neville(Matthew Lewis), who escorts them through a new secret passage into the castle, explaining why it is not featured on the Marauder's Map, how Hogwarts was fairing with Snape as Headmaster, as well as the influence of the sadistic Amycus and Alecto Carrow(Ralph Ineson and Suzanne Toase), the brother and sister in charge of discipline. The course formerly known as Defense Against the Dark Arts is now known as simply the Dark Arts, and the Carrows bruised Neville for refusing to practice the Cruciatus Curse (which incapacitated his own parents)on First Year Students.Harry is greeted with applause by his friends and roommates when they enter the chamber where the boats are kept. He announces their search for an unknown object. When he mentions its possible association with Ravenclaw House, Luna mentions that it may be Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem. In a moment where she literally takes Harry's breath away, Ginny( Bonnie Wright)appears, seeing Harry for the first time in six months, and warns him that Snape knows of his whereabouts.The staff and entire student body are made to dress in full uniform, and march to the Great Hall to be admonished by Snape about hiding information about Harry's whereabouts, demanding those in the know to reveal whatever information they may have and threatening severe penalties for failure to divulge such information. Harry, dressed in a student's robe over casual clothes steps from the ranks to reveal himself and angrily confront Snape about his audacity in taking Dumbledore's place and demanding that he reveal himself as Dumbledore's murderer. Both draw wands. McGonagall(Maggie Smith) takes her place by Harry's side as the Carrows back Snape. McGonagall takes out the Carrows as Snape disapparates through the stained glass window. Students cheer what is only a temporary victory as a celebratory McGonagall lights up the cauldron lanterns.All too soon, Harry falters  as Voldemort's satanic hissing, demanding Hogwarts will be left untouched if Harry surrenders himself, and that those who turn Harry over to him will be rewarded. Slytherin student Pansy Parkington (Scarlet Byrne) demands that someone grab Harry, who in turn, is defended by his friends.Upon Filch's (David Bradley) arrival, McGonagall demands he escort the counterproductive Slytherins to the dungeons, giving the other students one more reason to applaud before everyone must prepare for war.McGonagall  beckons the relief statues into animation to guard the campus boundaries as Flitwick (Warwick Davis), Slughorn( Jim Broadbent), and Molly Weasley(Julie Walters) send a defensive shield into the night sky, in an episode  highly reminiscent of the Battle of Britain.As Voldemort and followers wait on a distant hillside, Luna successfully urges Harry to confer with Helena Ravenclaw's ghost to find the next horcrux. The Order of the Phoenix members position themselves around the castle as Ron and Hermione destroy the cup from the vault at Gringott's  in the Chamber of Secrets. In the process, the romance of the young and often bickering couple is permanently sealed.Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) confronts Harry in the Room of Requirement, along with two cohorts as he locates the diadem. Draco demands the return of his wand, wrested by Harry at Malfoy Manor as Harry wonders why he didn't confirm his identity to Bellatrix. Draco explains that his mother's borrowed wand doesn't quite understand him, revealing that in many ways he is torn between the will of his parents and his own conscience, making him the story's most pitiable character.Goyle(Josh Herdman) urges Draco to kill Harry, But Ron and Hermione intervene. A battle ensues and Harry has to retrieve the diadem from a mound of brick-a-brack , from which Cornish pixies fly out. He retrieves it as the notoriously hysterical Ron grabs Hermione as Goyle accidentally ignites the room.In the end the diadem is destroyed but only two of Harry's detractors are saved.Another seizure and vision  reveal the impact of their actions on Voldemort as well as the last remaining horcrux.Seamus Finnegan (Devon Murray) and Neville help rig one of the bridges to the school with explosives, and the latter risks his life to bring about the desired result of this action.As the battle heats up, giants and death eaters descend upon the castle. Large spiders attack the courtyard, and Alberforth creates a shield when the dementors arrive, allowing the three main combatants to hurry to the astronomy tower to scout out Voldemort and the last horcrux.Through hazy stainglass windows, the trio witness the unforeseen results of Snape's chat with the Dark Lord. As Voldemort and Nagini disappear, the mortally wounded Snape urges Harry to take his tears to the pensieve, making a final and curious utterance about Harry having his mother's eyes....The Dark Lord gives Harry an ultimatum to turn himself over to him. But the three young combatants go to the Great Hall where they inspect the casualties, many of whom Harry held dear, including two who leave behind an infant son in a tragedy that parallels Harry's.Trekking over to the pensieve, Harry declassifies what Snape wanted him to know. With his views of the dour headmaster forever altered by profound revelations, he sits for a while, overwhelmed, but certain of the course of action he must take.Soon he rises, and as he exits Hogwarts for what may be the last time, he comforts a sorrowing Ron and Hermione, pleading with them to destroy the last horcrux.At the entrance to the forest, Harry has his Gethsemene moment. His golden snitch opens to reveal a Resurrection stone, enabling him to see and speak with a few of his beloved departed, drawing strength from their words before he goes on.As the Dark Lord and Death Eaters wait, with the captured Hagrid tied to a tree, Harry calmly approaches....While all seems at its darkest at this point, and those who fought to protect Harry fear all will end in heartbreak, viewers will see how Rowling's work will end with life-affirming triumph.We will watch a young boy(Arthur Bowen) whose initials interestingly enough, form the word, ""ASP"", follow in the footsteps of his forbears, joining his older brother (William Dunn), and cousin(Helena Barlow) on a rare and unusual journey, with a sister( Daphne De Bestingui) and another cousin (Ryan Turner )waiting in the wings.And so the saga ends, and yet begins anew. Assuming she is still at her post as Headmistress, we wish McGonagall well in dealing with  another generation of the Potter-Granger-Weasley combination, and know, that with them around, life at Hogwarts will never be dull.",5,"At Long Last, Villainous Mischief Managed!",1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,10827,"['was', 'boy', 'very', 'strange', 'enchanted', 'boy', '.And', 'ten', 'years', 'world',

But I cant get the app b/c i have a regular i-pod which was never a problem until today.

1241236,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,B001UV4XIS,Derek,"[1, 1]","To begin, this was a hard review to write. I've only seen the movie once and I went in with so many preconceptions that I will likely have to sit down and watch the movie again to get a real feel for the film and how much I like it. I saw it a while ago, but needed time to think it over a bit before spreading my thoughts before you.Second part to The Deathly Hallows and conclusion to one of the biggest film franchises in history, Part 2 follows Harry, Hermione, and Ron as they search out the last Voldemort horcruxes and try to stop an impending attack on Hogwarts.I certainly found this film refreshing and a lot more enjoyable than the slow and awkwardPart 1. While the first film had some enjoyable moments - our heroes breaking into the Ministry of Magic - it didn't add much to the film series. This film on the other hand delivered a great deal of satisfaction to any Harry Potter fan. The story moved along at a very pleasing pace and I was engaged throughout the entire film. There was enough spell-casting and wand fights taking place in this movie to appease any magic-lover. The resolution of each character's story was satisfying and everything led to a gratifying end. The performance of the actors was very good, the special effects were incredible, and I feel the series finished with a powerful bang.Still, while there was much that was good in the film, there were a few things that needed some more attention. First, I was sad that Nicholas Hooper - composer forOrder of the PhoenixandHalf-Blood Prince- was not in charge of the musical score for these last two films. His music for parts 5 and 6 was spot-on and added a great deal of depth and emotion to each film. I felt that his work on this film could have been an excellent contribution to the overall impact of the series end.Second, while it was a great jolt to see the deaths of some of our favorite characters, I felt the film did not do their deaths enough justice in this movie. The revelation of their deaths was a shock, but the film moved on too quickly for us to get a full blow of knowing these characters are gone. I little more hang time and emotion with each death would have made for a more intense and growing despair and an overall greater triumph in the end.Overall, the film was very enjoyable and rewarding. Definitely worth the time and money. Thus ends a great franchise.As far as questionable content:The film had some pretty violent moments and it certainly earns its PG-13 rating.

1241237,A3W3X1WBBY6I6B,B001UV4XIS,D. Fadden,"[3, 3]","I don't have the DVD yet but I am anxiously waiting.  I have to say I had a lot of hopes for Part II and likely that's why I was disappointed.  Twenty more minutes would have taken this movie from good to great.  All that build-up for the end battle and then when it finally comes, pttthhh! it's over.  What happened to the big show down taking place in front of the whole school?  I'm sorry but for the climax of the film the death of our two most hated baddies was a huge disappointment for me.  Honestly, don't blink or you'll miss it!It would have been nice to have seen how one of the twins was killed, or other main characters who suddenly we see are dead.  Killed by what?  And where was Hagrid's brother the half-giant?  We didn't see him in the battle at all.  Or Jinny...how she wanted to fight and people kept trying to stop her.  Nor did we see how Voldermort (sp?) uses his wand/power to flip Harry's limp body in the forest to incite laughs and jeers from his followers--which would have been painful to watch, but at the same time would have added to the darkness of this film.So much in the books was not in the film, so once again the film does not do the story justice.  However, this is a whole different medium...and with that in mind, they're wonderful and very visual films, still worth seeing many times as I do.  I never thought I'd get into the Potter series--until I did.  And the writing!  I have tried to read the Twilight books.  Couldn't do it.  Maybe she gets better with practice but the first book was very simplistic.  People compare that book series to this one--no comparison.  Few know how to world-build like J.K. Rowling. Or make characters so multi-faceted as many we've gotten to know & love here.What was great?  Pretty much everything else.  The old dragon was amazingly realistic.  At one point I could see the slide of muscle under his skin.  Very cool. Time to do the classic Pern series folks.  We have the stuff now to do that series justice.  Or at least the original first trilogy--I hated the later books.  Back to Potter--kudos for doing justice to the flashbacks revealing Snape as the devoted (to Lilly) and secret protector of Harry all these years.  For me reading that part of the story was very powerful and moving.  I was afraid the film would skim through what was a very important scene--and it did not.

The film was well done, relaying the dark tone of the story.  I first saw this movie on Bluray in 2D.After my 3 year son threw one of his toys into my flat-screen TV (lucky for him I was not a witness to his tantrum and destruction of a HDTV I paid nearly $4000 for.)This lead to me having a good excuse to buy the latest tech.  Now kitted out with a 70"" 3D compatible HDTV and 3D Bluray I was able to experience a format that I has dismissed as a fad.  I had a few titles already in 3D and to my great surprise the 3D effects of Active Shutter 3D glasses were astounding rivaling the 3D features at Disneyland's Kodak Theatre (Captain Eo, and Honey I shrunk the audience.)I got my hands on Harry Potter 7 parts 1 & 2 anticipating breathtaking 3D effects, boy was I sorely disappointed.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part one was so poorly 3D encoded that I had to check my glasses to make sure they were charged, checked the TV to make sure it was in 3D mode.  That was how poor the 3D effects were.  It is no wonder Part 1 was never released in the theater in 3D.  I thought ""This must just be a poor quality 2D to 3D conversion after the film was completed.  Now I figured ""They had to have filmed part 2 with 3D cameras, they had to.""  I was wrong, save a few gags (e.g. the floating plate Professor Snape's tears are poured into to show Harry Professor Snape's memories and Voldemort's snake striking out) and even those were very poor.  There is nothing to be gained in purchasing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in 3D.  The quality of the 2D transfers from film to Bluray are excellent.  Unless you can find the 3D for the same price, save your money, buy the 2D set.And those who are taking shots at this movie and giving it 1 star because of it having a Ultraviolet code, enough already.  Just the fact that Warner Bros. has chosen to support the Ultraviolet streaming service, yes it's a streaming service not a digital copy, does not warrant 1 star reviews.  WB has been issuing iTunes codes and in some cases Plays for sure discs when asked.  I have gotten iTunes codes for every Bluray and DVD that had a redemption code for the UV streaming service.  Many people may look to buy a copy of this film, see the sub 3 star rating, and not purchase this excellent film.  Save you 1 star ratings for films like The Wicker Man or Ishtar.  Unfortunately UV may be here to stay, be happy that most DVD and Bluray sets include both UV and regular digital copies.

1241263,A2ZTD6BWSIMQYV,B001UV4XIS,"E. Burke ""eburke1""","[7, 11]","While the sequences in Gringotts, the Goblins Bank, were very well done, and the school battles credible the Great Disaapointment came at the end where this movie is entirely unrecognizable from what author J.K Rowling wrote in her last book.  Voldemort died and left a dead body, it did not dissipate into flakes and blow away like the movie.  Nagini, the great Snake was also supposed to be in a gold globe that followed along behind Voldemort, what happened to that ?  The fire sequence in the room of requirements was way too long, and not nearly as important to the story as what they left out entirely.  The editing, if the scenes even existed, left those on the cutting room floor.  Harry and Voldemort have a wonderfull last battle, the End that all 8 books were building up to, and the movie robbed its viewers from seeing.  Harry was to have been in the Great Hall at Hogwarts surrounded by the friends and enemies while he circled Voldemort and Voldemort circled Harry wary and scared, while Harry takes Voldemort through his mistakes, his false assumptions about the death of Dumbledore, the loyalty of Snape, and the Elder wand.  Harry calls him Tom Riddle and explains that all the horcrux's are destroyed, and he tells Riddle he feels sorry for him because he has never known love.  By robbing the eight books of this far more satisfying end, the movie is a huge disappointment.  The 19 year later sequence also does not show that people watch Harry in the station as they would any famous hero, and his children seem puzzled by this.  In short the movie is not what the book portrays, and J.K. Rowlings story is significantly better and more satisfying than the screen play invented as a substitute for the actual story.In the actual story, the one written by the author J.K. Rowling, the Elder Wand was NOT broken by Harry, another bogus invention for the movie.  Harry replaced it in Dumbledore's tomb, knowing that when Harry died, the wand would become powerless.  Belatrix Le Strange was a great antagonist through her killing the parents of Nevel Longbottom, then Sirius Black, Harry's Godfather, and then the weasley twin, and she was behind goading Snape into making the curse to kill Dumbledore.  The sequence of her death at the hands of motherly old Mrs. Weasley is a necessary part that was reduced to a photo op unworthy of the author as well.  With all the really excellent HP movies the climax was a complete letdown for all the millions who actually bought and read all the books, as well as the movies.The only good thing that this produces is the hope that somone will one day do a proper movie that ends the Harry Potter saga as the author meant it to be ended. At the moment, the only way to know how the Harry Potter saga ends is to read the last book, the movie kept us from knowing how it actually does end.I would simply add that all this is fiction, make believe, and not in any way real or even possible.  Harry Potter is a brilliant invention from the mind of author J.K. Rowling, and we owe her for this truly wonderful invention, but never forget that it is only an invention with no connection to anything real beyond we who read it.  God is real, His Only begotten son Jesus is real, the Holy Spirit is real, but Harry Potter is not.  God is an absolute truth, one you may depend on, seek and find,  a truth and reality you can learn from which makes God very unlike myth and fiction.",2,JK Rowling wrote a better Ending than This !,1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,3431,"['sequences', 'Gringotts', 'Goblins', 'Bank', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'school', 'credible', 'Great', 'Disaapointment', 'came', 'end', 'where', 'movie', 'entirely', 'unrecognizable', 'what', 'author', 'J.K', 'Rowling', 'wrote', 'last', 'book', 'Voldemort', 'died', 'left', 'dead', 'body', 'did', 'not', 'dissipate', 'flakes', 'blow', 'away', 'movie', 'Nagini', 'great', 'Snake', 'was', 'also', 'supposed', 'be', 'gold', 'globe', 'followed', 'Voldemort', 'what', 'happened', 'fire', 'sequence', 'room', 'requirements', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'important', 'story', 'what', 'left', 'out', 'entirely', 'editing', 'scenes', 'even', 'existed', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Harry', 'Voldemort', 'have', 'wonderfull', 'last', 'battle', 'End', '8', 'books', 'were', 'building', 'up', 'movie', 'robbed', 'viewers', 'seeing', 'Harry', 'was', 'have', 'been', 'Great', 'Hall', 'Hogwarts', 'surrounded', 'friends', 'enemies', 'circled', 'Voldemort', 'Voldemort', 'circled', 'Harry', 'wary', 'scared', 'Harry', 'Voldemort', 'mistakes', 'false', 'assumptions', 'death', 'Dumbledore', 'loyalty', 'Snape', 'Elder', 'wand', 'Harry', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'horcrux', 'are', 'destroyed', 'Riddle', 'sorry', 'never', 'known', 'love', 'robbing', 'eight', 'books', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'end', 'movie', 'huge', 'disappointment', '19', 'year', 'later', 'sequence', 'also', 'not', 'show', 'people', 'watch', 'Harry', 'station', 'would', 'famous', 'hero', 'children', 'seem', 'puzzled', 'short', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'book', 'portrays', 'J.K.', 'Rowlings', 'story', 'significantly', 'better', 'more', 'satisfying', 'screen', 'play', 'invented', 'substitute', 'actual', 'story.In', 'actual', 'story', 'one', 'written', 'author', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'Elder', 'Wand', 'was', 'NOT', 'broken', 'Harry', 'bogus', 'invention', 'movie', 'Harry', 'replaced', 'Dumbledore', 'tomb', 'knowing', 'when', 'Harry', 'died', 'wand', 'would', 'become', 'powerless', 'Belatrix', 'Le', 'Strange', 'was', 'great', 'antagonist', 'killing', 'parents', 'Nevel', 'Longbottom', 'then', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'Harry', 'Godfather', 'then', 'weasley', 'twin', 'was', 'goading', 'Snape', 'making', 'curse', 'kill', 'Dumbledore', 'sequence', 'death', 'hands', 'motherly', 'old', 'Mrs.', 'Weasley', 'necessary', 'part', 'was', 'reduced', 'photo', 'op', 'unworthy', 'author', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'excellent', 'HP', 'movies', 'climax', 'was', 'complete', 'letdown', 'millions', 'who', 'actually', 'bought', 'read', 'books', 'as', 'well', 'movies.The', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'hope', 'somone', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'do', 'proper', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'saga', 'author', 'meant', 'be', 'ended', 'moment', 'only', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'saga', 'read', 'last', 'book', 'movie', 'kept', 'knowing', 'how', 'actually', 'end.I', 'would', 'simply', 'add', 'fiction', 'make', 'believe', 'not', 'way', 'real', 'even', 'possible', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'brilliant', 'invention', 'mind', 'author', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'owe', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'invention', 'never', 'forget', 'only', 'invention', 'connection', 'anything', 'real', 'who', 'read', 'God', 'real', 'Only', 'begotten', 'son', 'Jesus', 'real', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'real', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'not', 'God', 'absolute', 'truth', 'one', 'may', 'depend', 'seek', 'find', 'truth', 'reality', 'can', 'learn', 'God', 'very', 'myth', 'fiction']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Part II (2011, 131 minutes) - Overall I was extremely pleased with this second-part movie. It looked very well made overall, the actors all worked like mad, the slightly operatic tone was offset by the very touching performances. As a phenomenon-long Potterhead (the wife is, too) I had no difficulty following this film. However, if you are not a Potterhead, and have no guide with you to decipher the film, you're a goner.As such, this film moves along speedily - and I see that as a sad sort of shorthand. The most intense moments were scattered after a minute or so, like a cloud of magical ash. It got annoying, even though the film also clarifies points that may have confused fans. Further, in spite of the intense quality, there were moments that looked unfinished to me: CGI was not rendered sufficiently, blurry out-of-synch things, etc. Not such a big deal.The big deal was, as a body, the cameo performances everyone gave - including the stars. Close-ups of Daniel Radcliffe aside, this thing is perhaps the only film I've ever seen that gives EVERYONE a cameo role. It's as if director David Yates finally lost all control to the franchise, the genuine star of this entry of the series. Though it rendered a few moments sublimely albeit blessedly briefly, such as Snape's death, it was all too fast. They could have at least done what was done with the first two films: a good 3 hours was needed to do this precisely right.The film does serve as an excellent, kind of spicy tonic to its first part,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1. I know we all wondered how it would compare. I can only advise that both parts be watched consecutively as they should be seen. That is, if you can stay awake through Part I.Well, all in all, I loved it and we of course bought the plain dvd the moment it came available. Cinematic worth is in the eye of the beholder. We found lots was missing from Rowling's novel, but then again it was an overburdened novel. The film offers brief little homages to the earlier films, and the magic, along with certain surprises, will keep fans happy in the main.Fans who complained about the 19-year-later epilogue simply have no taste. It was executed in, well, a wizardly fashion! The actors all looked superb. And sadly, this is one of the times when Rowling's writing was followed closely. Also, I suggest you keep your eyes peeled for the flashback showing a 19-year-old Dumbledore, as played by the extremely beautiful Toby Regbo. This boy is a rising star, mark my words. Actually my only problem is I can't remember if he's in Part II or Part I.Oh well ... it'll give you something to scout for, along with the beautiful Nicholas Hoult who appears as Dumbledore's youthful boyfriend Grindewald, in the same set of flashbacks.Let me just leave you with the words of my hero, Roger Ebert, published just today under his syndicated column: ""The only responsibility of the script is to produce the best possible film. Those who think it must be 'faithful' ... treat adaptation like marriage. Fans ... will be outraged by any changes, but adaptation can ... mean improvement."" He then goes on to agree that cinema is losing lots of integrity and originality. He was not referring to HARRY POTTER - as he might as well have been doing.Fans, this is the end of an era. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), whom I adore, has moments in this film of which he is worthy and he's powerful. Dame Maggie Evans (Professor Minerva MacGonagall) also has her shining moments, and all of those moments made it worthwhile for me.Will it do so for you?",5,"""I'm ready to die.""",1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,3611,"['HARRY', 'POTTER', 'AND', 'THE', 'DEATHLY', 'HALLOWS', 'Part', 'II', '2011', '131', 'minutes', 'Overall', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'second-part', 'movie', 'looked', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'overall', 'actors', 'worked', 'mad', 'slightly', 'operatic', 'tone', 'was', 'offset', 'very', 'touching', 'performances', 'phenomenon-long', 'Potterhead', 'wife', 'too', 'had', 'difficulty', 'following', 'film', 'However', 'are', 'not', 'Potterhead', 'have', 'guide', 'decipher', 'film', ""'re"", 'goner.As', 'such', 'film', 'along', 'speedily', 'see', 'sad', 'sort', 'shorthand', 'most', 'intense', 'moments', 'were', 'scattered', 'minute', 'so', 'cloud', 'magical', 'ash', 'got', 'annoying', 'even', 'film', 'also', 'points', 'may', 'have', 'confused', 'fans', 'Further', 'spite', 'intense', 'quality', 'were', 'moments', 'looked', 'unfinished', 'CGI', 'was', 'not', 'rendered', 'sufficiently', 'blurry', 'out-of-synch', 'things', 'etc', 'Not', 'big', 'deal.The', 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'body', 'cameo', 'everyone', 'gave', 'including', 'stars', 'Close-ups', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'aside', 'thing', 'perhaps', 'only', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'EVERYONE', 'cameo', 'role', 'director', 'David', 'Yates', 'finally', 'lost', 'control', 'franchise', 'genuine', 'star', 'entry', 'series', 'rendered', 'few', 'moments', 'sublimely', 'blessedly', 'briefly', 'such', 'Snape', 'death', 'was', 'too', 'fast', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'done', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'good', '3', 'hours', 'was', 'needed', 'do', 'precisely', 'right.The', 'film', 'serve', 'excellent', 'kind', 'spicy', 'tonic', 'first', 'part', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '1', 'know', 'wondered', 'how', 'would', 'compare', 'can', 'only', 'advise', 'parts', 'be', 'watched', 'consecutively', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'can', 'stay', 'awake', 'Part', 'I.Well', 'loved', 'course', 'bought', 'plain', 'dvd', 'moment', 'came', 'available', 'Cinematic', 'worth', 'eye', 'beholder', 'found', 'lots', 'was', 'missing', 'Rowling', 'novel', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'overburdened', 'novel', 'film', 'offers', 'brief', 'little', 'homages', 'earlier', 'films', 'magic', 'certain', 'surprises', 'will', 'keep', 'fans', 'happy', 'main.Fans', 'who', 'complained', '19-year-later', 'epilogue', 'simply', 'have', 'taste', 'was', 'executed', 'well', 'wizardly', 'fashion', 'actors', 'looked', 'superb', 'sadly', 'one', 'times', 'when', 'Rowling', 'writing', 'was', 'followed', 'closely', 'Also', 'suggest', 'keep', 'eyes', 'peeled', 'flashback', 'showing', '19-year-old', 'Dumbledore', 'played', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'Toby', 'Regbo', 'boy', 'rising', 'star', 'mark', 'words', 'Actually', 'only', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Part', 'II', 'Part', 'I.Oh', 'well', ""'ll"", 'give', 'something', 'scout', 'beautiful', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'who', 'Dumbledore', 'youthful', 'boyfriend', 'Grindewald', 'same', 'set', 'flashbacks.Let', 'just', 'leave', 'words', 'hero', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'published', 'just', 'today', 'syndicated', 'column', 'only', 'responsibility', 'script', 'produce', 'best', 'possible', 'film', 'who', 'think', 'must', 'be', ""'faithful"", 'treat', 'adaptation', 'marriage', 'Fans', 'will', 'be', 'outraged', 'changes', 'adaptation', 'can', 'mean', 'improvement', 'then', 'agree', 'cinema', 'losing', 'lots', 'integrity', 'originality', 'was', 'not', 'referring', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'doing.Fans', 'end', 'era', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'whom', 'adore', 'moments', 'film', 'worthy', 'powerful', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Evans', 'Professor', 'Minerva', 'MacGonagall', 'also', 'shining', 'moments', 'moments', 'made', 'worthwhile', 'me.Will', 'do', 'so']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

1241270,AMMXFNJSKJUQ,B001UV4XIS,ElectricMelody,"[1, 1]","**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 7/15/11**There is no precedent for this. I can't think of any movie series that has been so long lasting with the same actors, or any other series where we have literally been able to watch the actors grow from children to young adults. It's been ten years now, and because of this, it's nearly impossible to review Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows Pt. II. It's such an exhausting, emotionally satisfying and bittersweet experience for so many people. It's not even really a film anymore. It's the end, the last bit of Potter as it exists now.Needless to say, I loved the movie. LOVED it. It was never going to capture every detail of the book, but I can't imagine a better capper to this always consistent series. Though largely jettisoning heavy plot for a simple, balls-to-the-wall war/sacrifice story, the movie manages to be the most emotional, gasp-inducing entry yet. Just like the book, this is dark, resonant stuff. I think every Potter fan will be satisfied, and there is no shortage of clap-and-cheer moments... payoffs that only a series of this length can properly produce.And above all, it's the characters. It's always been the characters, of course, but I can't think of another movie where I've felt more engrossed in the good vs. evil conflict. Sure, I already knew how it was gonna end, but the stakes were HIGH. Crazy high, and shiver-inducing at moments. It's in the expressions of the actors, the filters used in the cinematography and the swell of the music. Fictionalized wars don't mean a whole lot if you don't care about the people fighting. And in DH2, we not only care about the people, but we care about the place, too. Hogwarts has become iconic, as have the hills and valleys surrounding it.

I had hoped to put a copy on my phone to be able to watch it any time but you cannot with Ultraviolet without signing up for other junk, giving away your email address and installing two software packages - one, Adobe Air, from a company notorious in computer security circles for opening gaping holes in your computer for spyware, malware, and bots. Air may itself be ok, but with Adobe's reputation, I am not willing to risk it. It might or might not have even worked on my iPhone. It looked like it was only going to work on my laptop. In short, Ultraviolet is a pain, requires extra software, isn't a real digital copy but is a time-limited license if you do buy in, and mostly requires you to stream it while you actually can access the content. It stinks. It is a misnomer to call it a digital copy. Others are pointing out applications like Handbrake or to get the UK version out soon since that comes with a real digital copy. All we can do to stop this Ultraviolet idiocy is to boycott it. I won't be buying another DVD with Ultraviolet ever again.It's sad to focus on the NOT digital copy instead of the movie. All things like this do is cause people to look for ways to make copies which may lead to piracy. Ultraviolet is DRM taken to extreme.The movie itself is great and really ends the saga well.

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[2, 3]","The first ""Deathly Hallows"" movie covered about five hundred pages of the book, while this one covered the remaining two hundred.  But while the first one felt long, but not too long, this one, after a decent start, started to drag.Why?  Because almost every moment on screen consists of someone trying to murder and/or escape someone else.  After the fiftieth attempt on someone's life, I started wondering why more of the characters didn't just Apparate (magically transport themselves from place to place) rather than jumping into a lake or running helter-skelter.  Also, if someone was chasing you with fire, wouldn't it make sense to recite a counter spell which would invoke lots of water?  This isn't your ordinary action movie, where you have to dive into the air with your arms outstretched in order to keep from getting blown up.Anyway.  Harry, Ron and Hermione are continuing their search for the seven magical Horcruxes (objects containing parts of Voldemort's soul).  First they must break into Gringotts, a wizard bank, then escape via a cool CGI dragon.  Then it's back to Hogwarts to find the remaining Horcruxes, reunite with the students in Dumbledore's Army and fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters.Just like the previous films, there are lots of special effects, ranging from lame to pretty impressive.  Major characters, who the reader/viewer has grown fond of, die and are barely acknowledged, but this was true of the books.  All the actors, even the ones playing the characters' younger selves, do a good job, although Neville (Matthew Lewis) looks alarmingly old.

1241289,A15BHDNAUEBEKP,B001UV4XIS,Evelina,"[3, 8]","Some are like that. We don't expect total fidelity in all details, but spiritual fidelity. I can't help feeling the last movie made Snape too different from what he is in the book. The movie glamorized and enlarged his part.Snape as envisioned by Rowling would never have whispered tenderly to the baby Harry.  In the book, Snape was an mean, malicious, physically unappealing character who loved one person his entire life and who, with Dumbledore's help, which included tremendous moral pressure, stayed true to the side of the person he loved. Snape was on Voldemort's side until he killed Harry's mother.Rowling said she always wanted Alan Rickman to play Snape. In the book, she continually refers to Snape's greasy hair and huge hook nose. If an actor that resembled what she wrote had been cast in the part, Snape would not be what he is to many, which is a sex symbol.The final movie makes it seem as though Snape always liked Harry and just pretended to hate him. In the book, he genuinely hates Harry, but he nonetheless remains faithful to Dumbledore and the anti-Voldemort side, which is the side of Harry's parents.The movie was a bit false to the spirit of the book, in that Harry's father was belittled in order to elevate Snape. After seeing the movie, some people got the impression that Snape was Harry's father, which was never intended by the author. In the book, the father was killed trying to hold off Voldemort to give Harry and his mother time to escape. Harry's father also once saved Snape's life when they were at Hogwarts together. The movie treats the father somewhat cavalierly.Snape is instinctively on the Deatheaters side, but when he loves a anti-Deatheater who is murdered by Voldemort, he turns on that side. It seems that if Voldemort had not killed Harry's mother and had killed ever so many others, Snape would not have left that side. It is the murder of Harry's mother that turns him. That says something about the power of love, also revenge. Love elevates Snape and makes him stick to the anti-Voldemort contingent.Snape also represents the struggle between good and evil in one person. He has to struggle to be on the good side. For some reason, such characters hold great appeal.",5,For those who are unhappy when the book and movie differ to any degree,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,2225,"['are', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'total', 'fidelity', 'details', 'spiritual', 'fidelity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'last', 'movie', 'made', 'Snape', 'too', 'different', 'what', 'book', 'movie', 'glamorized', 'enlarged', 'part.Snape', 'envisioned', 'Rowling', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'whispered', 'tenderly', 'baby', 'Harry', 'book', 'Snape', 'was', 'mean', 'malicious', 'physically', 'unappealing', 'character', 'who', 'loved', 'one', 'person', 'entire', 'life', 'who', 'Dumbledore', 'help', 'included', 'tremendous', 'moral', 'pressure', 'stayed', 'true', 'side', 'person', 'loved', 'Snape', 'was', 'Voldemort', 'side', 'killed', 'Harry', 'mother.Rowling', 'said', 'always', 'wanted', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'play', 'Snape', 'book', 'continually', 'refers', 'Snape', 'greasy', 'hair', 'huge', 'hook', 'nose', 'actor', 'resembled', 'what', 'wrote', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'part', 'Snape', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'many', 'sex', 'symbol.The', 'final', 'movie', 'seem', 'Snape', 'always', 'liked', 'Harry', 'just', 'pretended', 'hate', 'book', 'genuinely', 'Harry', 'nonetheless', 'faithful', 'Dumbledore', 'anti-Voldemort', 'side', 'side', 'Harry', 'parents.The', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'false', 'spirit', 'book', 'Harry', 'father', 'was', 'belittled', 'order', 'elevate', 'Snape', 'seeing', 'movie', 'people', 'got', 'impression', 'Snape', 'was', 'Harry', 'father', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'author', 'book', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'trying', 'hold', 'off', 'Voldemort', 'give', 'Harry', 'mother', 'time', 'escape', 'Harry', 'father', 'also', 'once', 'saved', 'Snape', 'life', 'when', 'were', 'Hogwarts', 'together', 'movie', 'father', 'somewhat', 'cavalierly.Snape', 'instinctively', 'Deatheaters', 'side', 'when', 'anti-Deatheater', 'who', 'murdered', 'Voldemort', 'side', 'Voldemort', 'had', 'not', 'killed', 'Harry', 'mother', 'had', 'killed', 'ever', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'Snape', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'left', 'side', 'murder', 'Harry', 'mother', 'something', 'power', 'love', 'also', 'revenge', 'Love', 'Snape', 'stick', 'anti-Voldemort', 'contingent.Snape', 'also', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'one', 'person', 'struggle', 'be', 'good', 'side', 'reason', 'such', 'characters', 'hold', 'great', 'appeal']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

The fact that the producers kept him on is telling of their own problems. The whole series needed a better team. The scriptwriter was never any good IMO, and the producer's have to take the blame for that one as well as they kept him on and kept going back to him. The complaint for the series is much the same, too much was left out, and given the slow pace of the films, just try and find a reason why that is? The pace is so slow it seems we are watching ice melt, so you can't say time constraints are to blame.Oh well, it's ok, just barely. Perhaps if you haven't read the books the films won't seem so bad. Obviously, IMO the 3rd film was the best. Yes, the films got worse as the books got longer, but that is the fault of the production team, writer, director etc IMO. So much was either left out or changed and replaced by scenes that added nothing to the storyline, that one wonders about the English film/tv industry, yet all the actors were wonderful. Well, the kids grew up in the series, so you can't blame them for being more than kids at the time of the early films, which IMO were actually better despite the acting of the kids at times. They learned their craft, yet the story was fiddled with so much by the screenwriter and last director, that it isn't worth watching the films IMO. Go read the books first so you can fully feel the wasted results of this last film. The script is just plain mediocre at best leaving the actors little to do most of the time but pose and parade. It's a sad fact is it not? I wish them well, as I cannot wish well on the producers, writers and directors, no wonder the third one didn't want to come back.

I saw three of the first four movies last month via XFinity On Demand & one on television, and the final four films Monday, Tuesday and today (I saw the fifth film on Monday, the sixth film on Tuesday and the II part conclusion in the morning & afternoon today). As I was watching the first movie, I could see why Ms. Rowling chose to go the way she did as per the romantic relationships in the books. I was even more impressed when I saw how much a close friend of mine resembles Ginny in the movies. It made me think about her a lot. There's a scene late in the sixth film that I really like, because it reminded me that she is that way with me as well. In the films, Ginny is never mad at Harry, and the scene in the sixth movie is which reminds me of it just so moving I nearly cried.Of course, the books provide more information, and much of it was omitted from the scripts. A loss, though the decision to excise key points of plot & exposition was made for time constraints. I'm glad that the scene in the fifth book where Harry smashes Dumbledore's office in a fit of rage did not make it into the script, as I really hate that scene.I recommend the films.

1241314,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001UV4XIS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 4]","Stick a fork in the Harry Potter film franchise or as I like to call it - the Revival of Geriatric British Actors. There's a bittersweet pang because it's all over now, the books and the films and whatever was left of that sense of anticipation. But overriding that is this sense of relief and satisfaction. HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART II has kept faith with the source material, with the fans, and with fans of good cinema in general. It's a terrific send-off. I'm not saying this is the best film in the franchise; I've got fondness for THE PRISONER OF AZKHABAN and THE GOBLET OF FIRE, but it's damn close.J.K. Rowling's final book is my least favorite, or, more specifically, the bits in that book that involved wandering the friggin' woods. So you won't be surprised when I say that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART I meandered and moved like molasses for me despite all the terrific character work that went into it. Conversely, PART II is ridiculously fast-paced and, for the most part, focused on the epic Battle of Hogwarts, and it didn't lack for harrowing moments (this is rated PG-13, by the way, and the film handily earns it). PART II picks up very soon after the closing events of PART I, with the death of the house elf Dobby. There's a stillness - or maybe it's hushed anticipation - to these opening scenes as Harry, Hermione, and Ron are caught in temporary respite. But it's only the calm before the storm, and soon enough these three leap back into the fray. Minutes into the film, we witness an audacious heist at the Gringotts Wizarding Bank. The pace doesn't let up after that.- Harry Potter, to Hermione: ""When have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose.""That right there is indicative of Harry's mindset. And maybe what I've liked best about Harry is that he's clearly not the brains of the outfit (that's Hermione). Harry Potter gets by on sheer pluck and determination, and since I'm no brains either, Harry's qualities are those which I can definitely relate to. You can work your way to being plucky and determined - brains are more problematic to come by. It's been six months since Harry, Hermione, and Ron were last at Hogwarts, and sweeping changes have been effected. There's a palpable repressive mood hanging about. Professor Snape has become headmaster. Harry's allies have hunkered down into this rebellious guerilla unit. The search for the four remaining Horcruxes - enchanted items which house parts of Voldemort's soul - has led our kids back to their school, just in time for the final reckoning. Voldemort, thru his mystical link to Harry, is all too aware that three of the Horcruxes have already been destroyed, and he takes immediate steps to amass his army and lay siege to Hogwarts. There's something fairly awesome in seeing the professors of the houses of Hogwarts combine their mystic arts to invoke a protective spell around the school. The action sequences are granted epic stature, and there's even this gritty HENRY V vibe to the thing. When one invests in seven previous films, these final battle scenes definitely mean something, especially since plenty of the combatants end up paying for it. Hogwarts is demolished.Was there a lump in your throat, I wonder? The film delivered moments in which I threatened to tear up. But then there are also those ""Hell, yeah!"" moments. It's gratifying to see Maggie Smith let loose as Professor McGonagall. Those familiar with the books are clued in about Neville Longbottom, and he drew some of the biggest applause in the movie theater. But I have to say that my favorite bit of death duel happens between the wicked loony Bellatrix Lestrange and Mrs. Weasley.I'll have to see this again, and maybe several more times. Partly it's because I know I missed out on some detail, some tidbit I overlooked and, ergo, never got a chance to savor. Partly, it's because I don't quite want to let go yet. How do you follow up on Harry Potter? What, with Percy Jackson and the Olympians? Please. J.K. Rowling had layered in such richness and charm and a sense of spectacle and wonder into Harry's world that it's achieved its own reality, and the movies have conveyed those traits brilliantly onto the screen. The acting, across the board, is superb, with our three teens - Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint - holding their own against the vaunted elder thespians (I had a feeling Alan Rickman was gonna be outstanding, and he is). The special effects retain the standard that's been held to this franchise - meaning that it's superb. HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART II acts as an entirely satisfying, emotionally gripping finale to what has been one of the finest cinematic franchises ever. Well, okay, the epilogue may possibly draw a snicker or two.Oh, and there isn't enough of Luna Lovegood, dammit. For that bit of neglect, I say to the script writers: ""Furnunculus!""",5,"""We have a new weather report.

Rated ""PG-13"".Returning for the last time: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Matthew Lewis, Tom Felton, Michael Gambon, Evanna Lynch, Warwich Davis, Jason Isaacs, Helen Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith, Bonnie Wright, David Thewlis, Graham Duff, Julie Walters, Rusty Goffe, George Harris, Helen McCrory, John Hurt, Domhnall Gleeson, Devon Murray, Jessie cave, Afshan Azad, Isabella Laughland, Anna Shaffer, Gerogina Leonidas, Freddie Storma, Alfie Enoch, Katie Leung, William Melling, Ralph Ineson, Suzanne Toase, Jim Broadbent, Scarlett Byrne, Josh Herdman, Louis Cordice, Amber Evans, Ruby Evans, Miriam Margolyes, Gemma Jones, Clemence Poesy, mark Williams, James Phelps, Oliver Phelps, Chris Rankin, David bradley, Guy Henry, Nick Moran, Natalia Tena, Dave Legeno, Penelope McGhie, Emma Thompson, Judith Sharp, Emil Hostina, Bob Yves Van Hellenberg Huber, Granville Saxton, Tony Kirkwood, Ashley McGuire, Jamie Campbell Bower, Jon Campling, Paul Davies.Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) had found the sealed grave of Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and took the most powerful wand of all buried with him.In the previous movie,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1(2010), Voldemort explained to his council that he needed to use a different wand to kill Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) because his wand and Potter's were the same. He could harm him, but not fatally.Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) have been hiding from Voldemort and his army in various places, but now Harry realizes he must get inside the Hogwart's Castle without being seen.Now with Volemort even closer to finding our hero, Harry, Potter believes he must find Voldemort and kill him first.Option of languages and subtitles in English, French, Spanish.Special Features: 8 deleted scenes.Spoiler: I enjoyed the scenes when Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) was dueling with Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), but it was all too brief. Finally, Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) was given some action scenes of her own.The last novel in the Harry Potter series,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)was too long to make into one movie, so they split the story into 2 movies, hence, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One (2010) and Part Two (2011).If you would like to watch all the movies in proper order:Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Full-Screen Edition)(2001).Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Full Screen Edition)(2002).Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Full Screen Edition)(2004).Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Full Screen Edition) (Harry Potter 4)(2005).Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Full-Screen Edition)(2007).Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Single-Disc Full Screen Edition)(2009).Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey (short film: 2010).Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part One (2010).Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows, Part Two (2011). THE ENDSad to see the end of the Harry Potter movies. I have enjoyed seeing them all in their over 2 hours extended form. When it's a brilliant movie, I don't care how long it is.In 2010, J.K. Rowling said she still has the characters in her head and could definatly write an 8th, 9th and 10th book. ""I feel I'm done, but you never know. I love writing them.On June 23, 2011, Author J.K. Rowling officially announced she will not write another Harry Potter book again, however they have developed the ""Pottermore"" website exploring the entire world of Harry Potter and other characters.J.K Rowling has also mentioned if she should write again about Harry Potter and the World of Wizards and Quiddith, he may not be the central character.Sigh!All eight ""Harry Potter"" movies

It is a great movie to watch with your friends, your family, or even by yourself. They gave it great graphics just like the rest of them, but this film has one thing the rest of them don't. It has the intensity of Voldemort throughout the entire film. You finally get to see Harry show his true strength by going at it with Voldemort and all of his minions. They bring out many things in the castle that you have not seen in any other one of the films. In this film you find out who the true bad guys are and who the true good guys are, especially Severes Snape who posed as being cold and dark throughout the whole series by being so hateful and then joining Voldemort. The truth was that he loved Harry Potter and only killed Dumbledore by being ordered from him his self.

I feel like that qualifies me as a non-fan, so I can only judge the film as a general moviegoer.  Having said that, I thought it was an exhilarating couple of hours that provided an epic conclusion (overused phrase, but it fits) to the series.  It was a satisfying, action-packed ending with a few surprising twists and some incredible confrontations.  The climax was thrilling, and for me, the movie overall was more exciting and had a clearer plot structure than Deathly Hallows Part One.  It starts off fairly slowly for about the first half hour, establishing a dark tone that persists throughout the movie, and matches up well with the tone of Part One.  Then, once the plot begins to roll, the film rarely lets up, with intense battles and stunning special effects.  At times, especially the light-hearted moments, you get the feel of the first few movies, but it's basically a very dark, violent fantasy film that is quite different from the series' beginning.

Don't be put off by the many one star reviews. Most are complaints (quite legitimate, I'm sure) about the Ultraviolet digital copy. I purchased for the DVD and could not care less about Ultraviolet.2. The movie is by and large quite faithful to the book. This is both good and bad. The good obviously means that a great book is brought to the screen. The bad means that the pacing has to be very fast in order to preserve the structure of the book. This means that anyone not familiar with the book might have quite the task keeping pace as plot developments come at the viewer thick and fast.3. Unlike other films in this series this views much like an action movie with long battle sequences. Curiously, the film adopts some action movie motifs like magic wands that seem to emulate machine guns and artillery in their effects. This is also the case in Part 1 also. By and large, though strange, this worked for me. The escape from Gringott's and the battle of Hogwarts are fantastic sequences.4. Even if you've read the book don't watch this without watching Part 1. Get both parts and watch them in quick succession over a weekend at most.Highly recommended.

Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[1, 3]","In order for the Harry Potter movies to be regarded as a triumph of film-making it was essential that the final movie should be not only a satisfying conclusion, but the best film of the entire series. Happily, it is. This was the movie they got right.David Yates moves the film along at just the right pace; the action is practically non-stop, but not so frantic that there isn't time to take in what is happening. Steve Kloves provides the best script yet, retaining most of the essence of the book while upping the humor and the dramatic tension of the finale. The acting, especially by the three principals, is the best of any of the movies and although there are relatively few newcomers (Aberforth and the Grey Lady are the only substantial introductions) the stalwarts produce their best work in this film.There were a couple of things I really appreciated. The deaths, though not glossed over, were indicated subtly rather than in a gruesome manner. Those of the supporters of Harry were really not shown at all, which I thought was well-considered and made this movie much less sombre than might otherwise have been the case; and the deaths of those on the dark side were either off-camera or done in a surreal fashion. That makes this movie much more acceptable for younger viewers (and for this older viewer) than if everything had been shown in gory detail. In addition, the disposal of the final horcrux was done extremely well- in fact, to my mind, rather better than in the book, which relied on a somewhat far-fetched coincidence. Congratulations to those who came up with these ideas and also to J.K. Rowling for accepting them.There was one part I thought was missed and that was 'the gleam in Dumbledore's eye', which occurred in Book 4 and was the single most speculated-about phrase in the whole series until it was explained in Book 7. Here it is simply omitted, which leaves a gap in the logic of Harry's relationship with Voldemort and its consequences. However, that's a minor matter and those of us who know the books understand why things happened the way they did.The special effects are magnificent and all the more so because they don't take over the movie. The conflict between good and evil and the choice between the desire for power and the dread of the corruption it brings are concepts based on the characters rather than on the special effects and the characters are always in the forefront in this movie.No review would be complete without a tribute to Daniel Radcliffe. The whole series depended entirely on Harry being believable, likeable and someone with whom the audience could identify. Important though Ron, Hermione and the supporting cast were, it was with Harry that this series stood or fell. Without ever being guilty of scene-stealing, Daniel Radcliffe brought Harry to life brilliantly and never more so than in this movie. I'll be very disappointed if he isn't recognized by the Academy for a performance amazing in its scope for anyone, let alone someone who first played the role when he was 11 years old.This was a fitting conclusion to a series which is by far the most successful in the history of film-making. Did they save the best for last? Yes, they did.A short additional comment on the DVD.

Where Part One of the final episode was at the very least depressing (although still very well written, acted and performed), Part Two was an action adventure and possibly the most mature of all the films.  As I recall, much like the books, the movies became more adult oriented as the principles grew up in each successive movie.  The Series was more or less a celebration not only of Harry Potter as the focal point and hero of the story but was also a testimony to the fact that the females in the films (Hermione, Ginny Weasley, Lana and even Molly Weasley - Ron's mother) were strong role models for the independent woman(something that J.K. Rowling was aiming for). I was somewhat concerned about the ending in the movie and was not expecting it to follow the book's ending but was pleasantly surprised that it was done quite well and again matched that of the book. After 10 years of watching these young people grow from being children to adulthood, it is sad to think that this is the last of its kind. At least I have all of the movies in my library and can enjoy watching Harry, Ron and Hermione grow up and save the Wizarding World again and again. I have the BluRay/DVD/Ultraviolet Digital Copy and since I do not load digital copies onto my PC I would not have loaded the Ultraviolet copy anyway.  Nevertheless, it is extremely disturbing and disappointing that the movie industry like others are trying to take advantage of consumers to make a few extra dollars.

I remember thinking to myself on the surface, it did not look like much. But after reading it I came to have a new found fondness, and extreme like to that particular book. Similarly, in 2001 a movie adaptation was made. And I came to love and admire not only the books in the terrific series, but I came to enjoy the movies just as well. Here it is: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2So He who must not be named has taken hold of the elder wand, and for a mere moment, it appears that the bad guys have won. There is tragedy, pain, and unspeakable evil in this story; but there is also in the end, a beautiful and glorious triumph.The story in the movie is just as great as the novel is, so there is really no need to go any further.I will say that very few movies and movie series have made me care about the characters onscreen and in real life. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson brought what was just a children's fantasy novel and made it into one of the best series ever period. When someone says Daniel Radcliffe, the first thing you think of is Harry Potter. When someone says Rupert Grint you immediately think Ron Weasley. And when someone says Emma Watson, You remember the highly intelligent Hermione Granger. The acting in all 8 movies was good but Part 2 is where the acting from everyone is real as it gets. The actors/actresses in these movies are passionate and you feel it all the way throughout.I am sad to see the series end, but at least we know that Harry James Potter will not be forgotten(both onscreen and in book).All this said, there will not be another series or be it franchise quite like Harry Potter.

1241376,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001UV4XIS,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","This is it. Ten years after the first movie based on J.K. Rowling's world-wide bestselling novels, the Harry Potter series has finally reached its epic conclusion, setting the usual box-office records that accompany its arrival. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a landmark in this wildly successful series; not only is it the final installment, but at 130 minutes it's the shortest Potter film, and is the first to be presented in (post-converted) 3D. The film functions as the climax to the Harry Potter saga, as well as a reunion of all the characters we know and love. Every character here seems to get their moment and whether you're a casual fan or a complete fanboy of the series, there's a lot of emotional stuff here. As the title reflects, there's also a lot of death and this makes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 the most emotionally-charged entry in the series...It may also be the best of the series.The film begins with the final shot of Part 1, but truly opens with a marvelous, monochromatic shot of Hogwarts. From there, it is right back to Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) interrogating the goblin Griphook (Warwick Davis, doing double duty) about where to find the remaining Horcruxes so they can finally destroy Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Their quest will eventually lead them to a final confrontation at Hogwarts, now in shambles with Snape (Alan Rickman) as the new headmaster. Having never read the final book, I have largely avoided spoilers and I will assist you in doing the same.This film is set apart from the others by becoming noticeably darker. The whimsical fantasy elements are practically absent and the tone has matured along with the characters. This darkness is reflected tonally (you know you're in for something dark when Voldemort appears in fetus form) but also in the overall look, which is brought to life brilliantly by the limitlessly talented production team and director David Yates. It's not hyperbole that every aspect of the production looks stunning. Cinematographer Eduardo Serra has made even the most macabre images into shots of pure beauty, while the various elements of set design and art direction are impeccably rendered. Even Alexandre Desplat's score seems much more haunting than usual. The CGI department should be given raises for their astounding work on the spellbinding CGI which, when juxtaposed with the sets, costumes, and photography, make this film breathtaking to behold.These films have used nearly every British actor available and many of them reappear for a final time, particularly Maggie Smith (as Professor McGonagall) and Jim Broadbent, both absent from the last film. Even in the final chapter, there is still room for new faces including the, relatively unknown, Irish actor Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Aberforth Dumbledore. The actors give their all in their roles, with some even saving their best performances for last. Fiennes is terrifying as Voldemort, more so than ever before and his performance really blossoms here into the fully-realized incarnation of evil it's intended to be. Radcliffe, meanwhile, has not only grown in age, but also as an actor and he carries this film triumphantly in a way that only a real, mature actor could. The studio took a risk casting him, as well as Watson and Grint, but hopefully their success and growth throughout the years will encourage studios to be less weary of such risks. I believe the best performance may be by Rickman, still delightfully evil as Snape. Rickman leads this brilliant character through one of the best character arcs of any film series and he is as fascinating to watch as ever, giving a performance that stirs conflicting feelings of spite, as well as empathy and sadness. He has given a great performance since the beginning, but he's able to provide an emotional climax that really allows his performance to be fully appreciated.Any complaints to aim at this installment are few and far between, and some criticism may be at aspects taken directly from the book. First, the film almost seems apprehensive to reach its conclusion, throwing in everything it can at the last moment to keep it from getting there. That's not to say it drags or grows boring, it just feels drawn out at times. Finally, the epilogue (which is taken from the book) extends the metaphor of the series further than necessary. Not that this metaphor was ever closely concealed, but it pushes it from overhanging to blatant. It's a nice, simple ending and despite my reservations, I can't imagine a better one.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a miraculous achievement that closes the book on one of the most well-crafted series of films ever released. I hesitate to say it's the best film in the series, as my memory of the others has waned over the years, but I can't fathom how any of the other films could pack as much of a punch as this one. Aside from how stunning it looks, it's also heart racing and, for two hours, almost unbearably suspenseful. This is a landmark in cinematic history, an exciting and entertaining piece of pop culture, and a brilliant fantasy film. As one-half of a whole finale, it complements its counterpart brilliantly and stands alone as near-perfect end to a near-perfect saga.GRADE: ADue to a complete lack of 2D showings, I was forced to see the film in 3D, despite reservations about an already dark film being made darker by the 3D glasses and a weariness of the film being converted to 3D in post-production. To my surprise, the picture was still clear and no-less stunning than I'd imagine it would look in 2D. The 3D neither detracts from the film nor adds anything to it. I applaud Warner Bros. for the effort they put into the conversion, despite its complete lack of worth. The 3D does not draw you into the world onscreen nor does it throw anything at you. Essentially, it is completely unnecessary if for you to pay an additional fee for a supposed additional dimension that adds nothing additional.",5,A Near-Perfect Climax,1312070400,"07 31,

This film also had over done 3D in at least 5 scenes and 5 more easily visible 3D flaws.I hope this (the ultimate effort of conversion) finally convinces the 3D industry to just use a 3D camera setup when shooting.

Yates , WB and the cast have done a fine job ( w/ both parts), changes from the books made were less painful than earlier film cuts, although the occasional monologuing of exposition occurs, like Harry explaining wand lore and who the elder wand belongs to... May they didn't do enough of this, even, I thought Harry's on-screen Horcrux Math was lacking, if I hadn't read the material I questioned how it was condensed here. Harry actually says "" there's one Horcrux left ... I hope the less literate members of the audience could keep up with these potentially confusing leaps.  That complaint aside...The scenes in this story were ready made for cinema ... Breaking into and out of the Gringott's wizard bank, which even on screen is established as the most secure place in the very first adventure. Other homages to the decade of Potter history are made ofcourse... Basilisk anyone? Again I say the cast has done a super job in making us care about these characters , good and evil for what amounts to a 16 hour experience ... Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes are over the top as expected, but subtile performances are in the mix like, Dame Maggie Smith's at times elegant Prof. McGonagall portrayal, briefly many other Hogwarts cameos ( surprising how many students are still onboard from Year One).

WHen I did this, I found my love of the film growing.The arming of Hogwarts is amazing...so is the battle. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman give great performances and the progress Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe have made throughout the films is great. Their characters are believeable and honest and so well portrayed. I even liked the epilouge!While so many fans found things that disappointed them (and I still think the final battle should have been in the great hall in front of everyone) I think it's important to enjoy these films as their own thing.As far as extras on the BluRay, the conversation between JK Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe is amusing and informative. The feature on the women of Harry Potter is interesting but should have been longer. On the second disc you're only getting about 1 1/2 hours of content, which is a little sad. The movie mode (which allows you watch the film while being interrupted by the cast/crew with tidbits from the making of the series) is interesting, though a lot of the information wasn't new. Also some of the deleted scenes were put into the movie in this mode which was interesting but also annoying because they hadn't been finished in terms of special effects.I know at some point another version of all of these films will be released. And I can only hope for more special feature (or extended versions with completed new scenes added in). ALso I want some commentaries! It would have been so fun to sit listen to the three leads discuss their adventures while making all 8 films.So watch this and enjoy it for what it is.

Deathly Hallows is my favorite Harry Potter book, and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is my favorite Harry Potter movie. All of the trailers and featurettes and early reviews made the movie sound absolutely amazing. I try usually not to let hype get my expectations up too much, but in this case I couldn't help it. I was fully expecting the series to go out with a bangWere my high expectations met? Sadly...no. It was a big let-down, actually. It didn't feel like part of DH 1. It was more similar in tone to the Half-Blood Prince movie to me for some reason. It was too short and just felt chopped up. Like HBP, it seemed like a lot more was filmed, but then it was hacked in the editing room. And then I read that this was exactly the case...All of the actors, practically, from the previous films are back- for mostly blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos. The battle was lackluster and anticlimactic. At points it felt rushed, at other points too slow. A lot of the dialogue was changed and didn't feel right. The relationships were handled awkwardly. This is just my purist side, but a lot was changed from the book. I didn't think it would be that way, after Part 1. It really let me down.Was it a terrible movie? By no means. The acting was good, the special effects were great (though I wouldn't pay the extra money for the 3D), and some of the scenes did hit the mark.  I know I bashed it pretty hard up there, but, really, the majority of my complaints are based only on the changes from the book. I'm judging it not really for the movie it was but for the movie it could have been, the movie I wanted it to be. The hype definitely ruined things for me. I feel like I would have liked it better if I hadn't read the books. But then again, my brother, who has only seen the movies, was also let down. He was disappointed by the lack of a bit epic battle scene that he was expecting there to be.

I was riveted the entire time, and very moved in the end. I thought every single person turned in a stunning performance - Ralph Fiennes is breathtaking as Voldemort, as is Alan Rickman as Snape, all three young leads, and the fabulous British supporting cast. It was great to see so many of the latter back, albeit briefly.As for the plot, you won't follow it unless you've read the books and/or seen the other films. The action revolves around Harry and his friend's search for the final horcuxes - pieces of Voldemort's soul he's hidden away for safekeeping - and the climactic battle that ensues. And the battle at Hogwarts is epic, truly marking this as a timeless film about good and evil, what is worth fighting for and what is worth loving. It is moving and deep, and it is very adult - this is not a children's, or even really a young-adult, story or film at this point.One thing that not many others have mentioned about this series is the spiritual aspects, which is part of why it is a favorite series of mine, and I think this is carried off really well in this film. Harry's meeting 'in the light' with Dumbledore is handled brilliantly, without being sappy or preachy. Snape's discussion with Dumbledore re: why Harry must die, and the Christ-like message regarding his role as a saviour, is also handled with a deft touch. The result is a movie with many universal spiritual themes that does not come off as preachy or sentimental.Overall, I don't think this could have been done better.

1241426,A17CLMFNV7BUK6,B001UV4XIS,L Hoover,"[0, 0]","SPOILERS POSSIBLE:This movie (and the book) were an incredible wrap up to an incredible series.  Adults and children alike are touched by and wrapped up in these stories; my husband is by no means a voracious reader (he reads a couple of books a year) but he has read all of these books multiple times and he has almost an encyclopedic knowledge of the world Rowling has created.  And it is just that; a world - the creativity with which she crafts her characters and the landscape and plot around them is almost unparalleled.  I do not think it is excessive praise to compare her stories to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.In particular one cannot praise her characters too highly.  Her heroes are truly heroic, and there can be few villains in history that can rival Voldemorte.  However, perhaps her best character of all turns out to be Severus Snape.  The depth of the character she creates in Snape, not just in this story but throughout the series, is almost unparalleled.  Snape's story is incredibly complex and she does such an excellent job of hiding the truth until the end.  She manages to take a character that many probably loathed for many years and turn him into almost as much of a hero as the main character(s), which is impressive.I also have to give her kudos for her choices in how to resolve the story; I thought she had just the right amount of carnage, for lack of a better way to put it.  I was afraid she would ""cop out"" and not kill any important characters, and I was happy (from a literary perspective) to see that she made the hard choices.  It would not have had the same impact had she chosen to avoid killing any characters we cared about.  In the same vein, I am so glad she had an epilogue; it set just the right tone to get across the message of hope.  As someone else said, it reminds us what was worth fighting for.As for the movie specifically, I thought it was excellent.  The special effects were excellent, as always.  I thought the cast and crew did a phenomenal job on this movie in particular.  I was especially impressed with how well the director (I assume he should get the credit) melded the scenes to show us how Harry and Voldermorte were two sides of the same coin.  He did an excellent job of highlighting just how connected the two were.  The suspense was excellent, as was the way the story flowed.

I had heard from others that had seen it that it was very true to the book.  They were right.  I was amazed to see the 2nd half of the book come to life on the big screen.  The special effects were incredible!  I do remember crying a few times during a few scenes...  Which is a good thing of course.The acting was great.  Of course Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were terrific as always (loved them in the epilogue).  But the one person's performance who I just adored, even though he wasn't in the movie much was Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.  Talk about a riveting performance.  He deserves an award for the scenes he was in!  The scene between him and Harry was just so emotional and perfect.  You really learn to love Snape in this film.  I know everyone probably knows what happens but just in case, I'm not going to say.I understand that many people are not happy with the ultraviolet digital copy of the movie that comes with this.  I have never used the digital copy of the movies I have purchased on Blu-Ray/DVD combo packs so this doesn't really affect me but I do understand why others are unhappy...who wants to pay for a digital copy of a movie they have already bought?!

The shocking revelation about Ariana's history which was a key to all of the books other than a part of Voldy living inside of Harry was never mentioned.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[5, 9]","Not having seen all the Harry Potters I went to see this on opening weekend with friends who updated me on part 1 to bring me up to date.If you have not seen Deathly Hallows part 1, or the previous Potters here is what you need to know.  Harry Potter, young wizard with friends, gets into trouble (again) and uses magic to get out (again).  Mortal enemy Voldemort intends to get him and rule the magical world with his evil powers.  He must be stopped before it's too late. His soul is in seven different locations.  Some of these have already been found in part 1.  In order to win against this enemy HP must find all these remaining portions, and destroy them, and in so doing end Voldemort's reign.Another key character is Snape played by Alan Rickman, who also goes by the name of Severus.  His role in previous movies has been occasional ally, occasional foe.  Here his role will be completely defined, and understood.Voldemort needs serious plastic surgery, particularly, a nose job, an ear job, and eyebrow implants.  You would think with all his magical powers that he might work some magic on his appearance first, but no!Not being an HP aficionado, I did enjoy the movie.  We watched in 3D. I think it would be just as enjoyable in 2D.One thing I enjoyed about the movie were the turns of phrase:'I want to speak to the goblin.'  We found this quite amusing.'The wand chooses the wizard.''If you ask you will never know.  If you know, you need only ask.''If no one alive has ever seen it, then let's ask someone dead.''Now is the time to come forward or be destroyed.'  Voldemort.The deeper you go into the movie the better it gets, as you get drawn into what is particularly Harry Potter, goblins, invisible swords, diodems, as the train pulls out of Hogwarts for the last time.  Finally you get a sense of clarity, and even some unexpected emotion at what happens to key characters.  Those will they, won't they moments. Even those life and death moments.Obviously, HP has kept the British acting industry employed for several years, and made Emma Watson the world's highest paid actress according to the Guinness Book of Records.Having seen four of the series, this is the best one I have seen.  The quality of the movie, direction, acting, story is top notch, demonstrates that Britain also can produce not only the James Bond franchise, and Harry Potter, but also many other movies that can rival the best of Hollywood.

1241444,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B001UV4XIS,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","First a confession: I used to be a muggle until very recently. I never read the books and I watched ""Harry Potter"" movies for the first time in April and May this year at the express invitation (order) of my daughter. And since the first movie I watched I was immediately captured by the magic of those stories and I saw the last movie in the saga the first day it opened in cinemas.Considering that the movie is still playing, I will try not to provide spoilers, but let me just say, that this film really ends the whole ""Harry Potter"" saga with great skill, power and brilliance. I am certain that the scenario had to cut some excellent things which were present in the book, but still, the final chapter is a VERY powerful story!All the main actors perform brilliantly. Daniel Radcliffe has a real talent and in this movie it shows. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are as good - and I see a great future in the movies especially for Ms Watson. Allan Rickman's Professor Snape is simply impressive and Helena Bonham-Carter's Bellatrix Lestrange is as crazy as usual. Ralph Fiennes plays Voldemort as being even more fiendish than in previous parts - and the Dark Lord also displays personnel management style clearly inspired by Darth Vader... I must say that the delight with which Voldemort screams his ""Avada Kedavra"" curse every time in this movie made me really shiver...The thing which I liked particularly is that some of the secondary characters rise to their best. It is of course the case for Neville Longbottom, who finds his internal hero and for Luna Lovegood, who is my absolutely favourite character since the first moment she appeared in the story. But the character who suddenly deploys the wings to rise to her real greatness is Professor Minerva McGonagall! This is without any doubt her greatest hour and she reveals herself to be not only a great witch but also a great general!An excellent idea was to plunge the movie mostly into darkest night and gray shadows. Even when the sun rises, it is obscured not only by thick dark clouds but also by something else, like ashes of a burning world mixed with tears of grief... The atmosphere for this last battle for the future of the world is quite apocalyptic. The battle scenes are very impressive and the siege of Hogwarts seems to be fought as intensely as that of Minas Tirith in ""Lord of the Rings"".The ending of the movie is very good and closes with necessary dignity this incredible saga. I recommend to everybody to see this film, even if you are not that much into ""Harry Potter"". After seeing this last chapter of the saga I abjured once again and for always my previous muggleness and I will now read the books which my daughter will (I hope) lend me...",5,Extraordinary cinema moment concludes a great saga (review written by a former muggle),1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,2731,"['First', 'confession', 'used', 'be', 'muggle', 'very', 'recently', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'watched', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'first', 'time', 'April', 'May', 'year', 'express', 'invitation', 'order', 'daughter', 'first', 'movie', 'watched', 'was', 'immediately', 'captured', 'magic', 'stories', 'saw', 'last', 'movie', 'saga', 'first', 'day', 'opened', 'cinemas.Considering', 'movie', 'still', 'playing', 'will', 'try', 'not', 'provide', 'spoilers', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'film', 'really', 'whole', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'saga', 'great', 'skill', 'power', 'brilliance', 'am', 'certain', 'scenario', 'had', 'cut', 'excellent', 'things', 'were', 'present', 'book', 'still', 'final', 'chapter', 'VERY', 'powerful', 'story', 'main', 'actors', 'perform', 'brilliantly', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'real', 'talent', 'movie', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'are', 'good', 'see', 'great', 'future', 'movies', 'especially', 'Ms', 'Watson', 'Allan', 'Rickman', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'simply', 'impressive', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'as', 'crazy', 'usual', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Voldemort', 'being', 'even', 'more', 'fiendish', 'previous', 'parts', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'also', 'personnel', 'management', 'style', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'must', 'say', 'delight', 'Voldemort', 'screams', 'Avada', 'Kedavra', 'curse', 'time', 'movie', 'made', 'really', 'shiver', 'thing', 'liked', 'particularly', 'secondary', 'characters', 'rise', 'best', 'course', 'case', 'Neville', 'Longbottom', 'who', 'internal', 'hero', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'who', 'absolutely', 'favourite', 'character', 'first', 'moment', 'appeared', 'story', 'character', 'who', 'suddenly', 'wings', 'rise', 'real', 'greatness', 'Professor', 'Minerva', 'McGonagall', 'doubt', 'greatest', 'hour', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'witch', 'also', 'great', 'general', 'excellent', 'idea', 'was', 'plunge', 'movie', 'mostly', 'darkest', 'night', 'gray', 'shadows', 'Even', 'when', 'sun', 'obscured', 'not', 'only', 'thick', 'dark', 'clouds', 'also', 'something', 'else', 'ashes', 'burning', 'world', 'mixed', 'tears', 'grief', 'atmosphere', 'last', 'battle', 'future', 'world', 'quite', 'apocalyptic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'siege', 'Hogwarts', 'be', 'fought', 'as', 'intensely', 'Minas', 'Tirith', 'Lord', 'Rings', '.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'closes', 'necessary', 'dignity', 'incredible', 'saga', 'recommend', 'everybody', 'see', 'film', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'seeing', 'last', 'chapter', 'saga', 'abjured', 'once', 'again', 'always', 'previous', 'muggleness', 'will', 'now', 'read', 'books', 'daughter', 'will', 'hope', 'lend']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"
1241445,A26EVICJKBSPI8,B001UV4XIS,MacMan73,"[83, 117]","First off, I get that the entire world seems to love this movie, almost blindly.  In my experience, the people I know who loved this movie the most are those who have not read the books.  I must say I envy them to a certain extent, because it is astounding how any film-maker could miss the cinematic opportunities presented by Rowling's amazing source material.I honestly don't know where to begin.Let's start with a single line of dialogue from McGonagall.  She is commanding the statues of Hogwarts to defend the school.  This could have been a powerful moment from one of the most underused characters in the film series (don't even get me started on Order of the Phoenix), but the moment is completely derailed by the line ""I've always wanted to perform this spell.""  The literary character of McGonagall never would have said that.  That line was simply juvenile, and a lame attempt to inject humor into a situation where it simply did not fit.Then, we have a scene which should have made everybody in the theater want to stand up and cheer, but it was done in such a contrived way, it fell flat.  The scene I am referring to is, of course, the Molly vs. Bellatrix scene.  It was just entirely too rushed, and that little look of self-satisfaction on Molly's face afterward was all wrong.  A battle is still raging around her, her son is dead, and this was the first time she had ever taken a life to protect her child.  That look was wrong for the moment, wrong for the character, just WRONG.What about Hagrid?  He shows up captured in the forest.  How he got there, nobody knows.  So many fans have been waiting to see the fierce giant come out in Hagrid.  In the books, he was a fighter.  In the films, he is, for the most part, a stuffed animal.  A scene of Hagrid taking out a dozen or more Death-eaters before being overrun would have been EPIC.  And then, in the courtyard battle, to get a couple of great shots of a raging Hagrid throwing Death-eaters around would have been equally epic.  This is where I just don't get David Yates as a director.  How hard would these Hagrid scenes have been to shoot?  You need a close-up of Robbie Coltrane showing some serious rage, then a wide shot of the scale double heaving some death-eaters on wires.  Was money an issue?  It couldn't have been time.  This was the shortest HP movie of the series, and the whole point of dividing the book into two films was so you COULD do this stuff.Harry revealing himself to be alive should've been the most climactic moment of the movie.  Again, a stand-up-and-cheer moment. And it was completely anti-climactic.  We get a grin from Hermione.  Oh, Harry is alive.  That's nice.  I thought Neville was going to kill Nagini right there in the courtyard.  And in the moment that Voldemort goes down, temporarily weakened by the death of another Horcrux, Harry rises up.  The poetry and power of that moment would have been ELECTRIC.  And it falls flat.Which leads me to Voldemort's death.  Okay, I admittedly enjoyed a lot of the chase and fighting through the castle between Harry and Voldemort, but it should've ended in the Great Hall, you know... like it did IN THE BOOK.  Instead, Harry defeats him with nobody around.  And how did he defeat Voldemort?  Well, that is a mystery. He successfully disarmed him, and apparently that's all it takes.  Even Voldemort's defeat is woefully underplayed here.  It should have happened in front of everyone, and now I guess they just have to take Harry's word for it.  What is it about main bad guys evaporating into the wind when they die?  There's bodies of dead students, teachers, you name it...  But I digress.I get the sense that the film-makers and screen-writers think that the only characters we really care about are Ron, Hermione, and Harry.  It's sad to see such a waste of amazing talent and cinematic opportunities.That said, I thought The Prince's Tale was handled beautifully.  If only the other important plot and character moments of the film were delivered as satisfyingly.  What a missed opportunity.

1241468,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B001UV4XIS,Melissa Niksic,"[12, 15]","I have to give this film five stars even though I wasn't completely satisfied with it. To be fair when critiquing this film, you need to judge the film on its own merits and not just compare it to the book it was based on. Even though the film adaptation of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part Two"" took many, many, MANY liberties with J.K. Rowling's book, the end result is still a spectacular and entertaining film that really delivers everything audiences have been expecting. It's filled with action, drama, suspense, and an amazing ending to a story that's captured moviegoers' hearts for the past decade.And then there are the fans of the books. Like me. And although I recognize that ""Deathly Hallows, Part Two"" succeeds as an entertaining movie, there are some things about it that really bugged me.I understand that things always need to be cut for the film versions of books, and I also realize that filmmakers often change things just to make them a bit more entertaining when they transfer to the big screen. Some of those things I take no issue with (spoilers are ahead, so consider yourselves warned). For example, little things that were changed for the movie (altering Ron and Hermione's big kiss, adding a little Neville and Luna romance, etc.) did not bother me. Other changes actually were for the better (showing the scenes where Ron and Hermione seek out the basilisk's fang and where Neville kills Voldemort's snake), because the audience got to see these moments that were never described in detail in the book.However, certain things about the movie were changed for absolutely no reason and added no value to the film whatsoever. The thing that annoyed me the most was the way Molly Weasley killed Bellatrix. When Bellatrix died, she sort of shattered like a piece of glass. What was that all about?! And the end sequences with Harry and Voldemort were so different from the way they played out in the novel: still entertaining for the movie version, but different for no apparent reason. I also thought the Fred Weasley death scene was glossed over way too quickly. The way the scene was shown, you didn't even get a good look at Fred's body. Unless people read they book, they may not realize who it was that died. It just did not do them moment justice. I thought that was the problem with a lot of the changes in the movie...and there are many more that I haven't mentioned here. The film tried to make many of these moments ""bigger"" for the movie audiences...more action-packed. But the result was that the scenes lost some of the emotion attached to them, weakening things that were so powerful in the book and making certain aspects of the movie a bit anticlimactic, in my opinion. It was unnecessary and disappointing.My favorite parts of the movie included the whole Snape pensieve flashback sequence, which was definitely a bit different from the book but was so incredibly well-done that it didn't matter. The epilogue was also fantastic. I was a little worried about how successfully the film's makeup artists would be able to age these young actors to make them look like they were in their 40's, but they did a fantastic job and the final scenes of the movie are absolutely brilliant. (I will say, however, that I wish the film included info about what Harry, Ron, and Hermione were doing in for their professional adult careers. That was something that was entirely omitted from the movie.) I also really loved the way the film included flashbacks from the movie ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" It was great to see those scenes of the three main characters when they were so young, and then see the amazing young people they've grown up to be.So, all in all, when viewing the movie just as a movie itself, I give it five stars. It's a very well-done and entertaining film. However, Harry Potter purists like myself may be a bit disappointed that so much of the material from the book was tampered with.",5,"Five-star movie, four-star adaptation",1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,3959,"['have', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'satisfied', 'be', 'fair', 'when', 'critiquing', 'film', 'need', 'judge', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'not', 'just', 'compare', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'Even', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', 'Two', 'took', 'many', 'many', 'MANY', 'liberties', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'book', 'end', 'result', 'still', 'spectacular', 'entertaining', 'film', 'really', 'everything', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'expecting', 'filled', 'action', 'drama', 'suspense', 'amazing', 'ending', 'story', 'captured', 'moviegoers', 'hearts', 'past', 'decade.And', 'then', 'are', 'fans', 'books', 'recognize', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', 'Two', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'are', 'things', 'really', 'bugged', 'me.I', 'understand', 'things', 'always', 'need', 'be', 'cut', 'film', 'versions', 'books', 'also', 'realize', 'filmmakers', 'often', 'change', 'things', 'just', 'make', 'bit', 'more', 'entertaining', 'when', 'transfer', 'big', 'screen', 'things', 'take', 'issue', 'spoilers', 'are', 'ahead', 'consider', 'yourselves', 'warned', 'example', 'little', 'things', 'were', 'changed', 'movie', 'altering', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'big', 'kiss', 'adding', 'little', 'Neville', 'Luna', 'romance', 'etc', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'Other', 'changes', 'actually', 'were', 'better', 'showing', 'scenes', 'where', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'seek', 'out', 'basilisk', 'fang', 'where', 'Neville', 'Voldemort', 'snake', 'audience', 'got', 'see', 'moments', 'were', 'never', 'described', 'detail', 'book.However', 'certain', 'things', 'movie', 'were', 'changed', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'added', 'value', 'film', 'whatsoever', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'most', 'was', 'way', 'Molly', 'Weasley', 'killed', 'Bellatrix', 'When', 'Bellatrix', 'died', 'sort', 'shattered', 'piece', 'glass', 'What', 'was', 'end', 'Harry', 'Voldemort', 'were', 'so', 'different', 'way', 'played', 'out', 'novel', 'still', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'version', 'different', 'apparent', 'reason', 'also', 'thought', 'Fred', 'Weasley', 'death', 'scene', 'was', 'glossed', 'over', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', 'way', 'scene', 'was', 'shown', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'Fred', 'body', 'Unless', 'people', 'read', 'book', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'who', 'was', 'died', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'moment', 'justice', 'thought', 'was', 'problem', 'lot', 'changes', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'have', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'here', 'film', 'tried', 'make', 'many', 'moments', 'bigger', 'movie', 'audiences', 'more', 'action-packed', 'result', 'was', 'scenes', 'lost', 'emotion', 'attached', 'weakening', 'things', 'were', 'so', 'powerful', 'book', 'making', 'certain', 'aspects', 'movie', 'bit', 'anticlimactic', 'opinion', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'disappointing.My', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'included', 'whole', 'Snape', 'pensieve', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'was', 'definitely', 'bit', 'different', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'well-done', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'epilogue', 'was', 'also', 'fantastic', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'how', 'successfully', 'film', 'makeup', 'artists', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'age', 'young', 'actors', 'make', 'look', 'were', '40', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'wish', 'film', 'included', 'info', 'what', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'were', 'doing', 'professional', 'adult', 'careers', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'entirely', 'omitted', 'movie', 'also', 'really', 'loved', 'way', 'film', 'included', 'flashbacks', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'scenes', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'when', 'were', 'so', 'young', 'then', 'see', 'amazing', 'young', 'people', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'be.So', 'when', 'viewing', 'movie', 'just', 'movie', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'very', 'well-done', 'entertaining', 'film', 'However', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'purists', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'book', 'was', 'tampered']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

I love the contrast between the light hearted adventures of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to the extreme emotional intensity of this movie. Each movie has gotten progressively darker and this was an emotional finale. Once we reach the part in Snape's memories where we see Lily telling Harry how loved he was and to ""be safe,be strong."" just before her death,we have a whole series of scenes that touch the heart and soul with their sadness and/or poignantness : Dumbledore explaining how Harry must die. Lupin Talking about the son he'll never know,Lily saying they would ""always"" stay close to Harry,Harry sacrificing himself,and Neville's speech declaring loyalty to Harry even in his ""death"". I'm not very sensitive in general,but Harry Potter really brought some raw emotion out of me. I cried during most of those scenes listed above when I saw this movie for the 1st time and I can still have strong reactions to them. The greatest triumph of Harry Potter is how much the series is highly successful in making it's readers/viewers care about it's characters. Then there's Snape himself. The way Snape's memories were brought to life is awesome and fantastically well done. The acting,especially of Daniel,Alan,and Ralph is exceptional. One major change from the book is far better in the movie than in the book. That change involves the fate of the Elder Wand. In the book,Harry tells the portrait of Dumbledore that he will return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's grave. Harry tells Dumbledore If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won't it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That'll be the end of it."" However,because the Elder Wand was truly won by defeat,and not necessarily by murder,this was no guarnteee the Elder Wand would never be won from him. By destroying the Elder Wand,as Harry does in the movie he ENSURES it's power will be broken. The movie's way of handling that was far better than the book's.And i really enjoyed the epilogue. Seeing Harry see his son off to Hogwarts was heartwarming. And I LOVED how the classic music from the 1st 2 Harry potter movies as the Hogwarts Express pulls out. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was a richly rewarding conclusion to the Harry Potter series and is a lock for 5 stars. :)",5,Harry Potter's emotional finale.,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,2404,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'part', '2', 'epic', 'emotional', 'conclusion', 'favorite', 'movie', 'series', 'love', 'contrast', 'light', 'hearted', 'adventures', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'extreme', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'movie', 'movie', 'gotten', 'progressively', 'darker', 'was', 'emotional', 'finale', 'reach', 'part', 'Snape', 'memories', 'where', 'see', 'Lily', 'telling', 'Harry', 'how', 'loved', 'was', 'be', 'safe', 'be', 'strong', 'just', 'death', 'have', 'whole', 'series', 'scenes', 'touch', 'heart', 'soul', 'sadness', 'poignantness', 'Dumbledore', 'explaining', 'how', 'Harry', 'must', 'die', 'Lupin', 'Talking', 'son', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'Lily', 'saying', 'would', 'always', 'stay', 'close', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'sacrificing', 'Neville', 'speech', 'declaring', 'loyalty', 'Harry', 'even', 'death', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'sensitive', 'general', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'really', 'brought', 'raw', 'emotion', 'cried', 'most', 'scenes', 'listed', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', '1st', 'time', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'strong', 'reactions', 'greatest', 'triumph', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'how', 'much', 'series', 'highly', 'successful', 'making', 'readers/viewers', 'care', 'characters', 'Then', 'Snape', 'way', 'Snape', 'memories', 'were', 'brought', 'life', 'awesome', 'fantastically', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'especially', 'Daniel', 'Alan', 'Ralph', 'exceptional', 'One', 'major', 'change', 'book', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'book', 'change', 'fate', 'Elder', 'Wand', 'book', 'Harry', 'portrait', 'Dumbledore', 'will', 'return', 'Elder', 'Wand', 'Dumbledore', 'grave', 'Harry', 'die', 'natural', 'death', 'Ignotus', 'power', 'will', 'be', 'broken', 'wo', ""n't"", 'previous', 'master', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'defeated', ""'ll"", 'be', 'end', 'However', 'Elder', 'Wand', 'was', 'truly', 'won', 'defeat', 'not', 'necessarily', 'murder', 'was', 'guarnteee', 'Elder', 'Wand', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'won', 'destroying', 'Elder', 'Wand', 'Harry', 'movie', 'ENSURES', 'power', 'will', 'be', 'broken', 'movie', 'way', 'handling', 'was', 'far', 'better', ""book's.And"", 'i', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'epilogue', 'Seeing', 'Harry', 'see', 'son', 'Hogwarts', 'was', 'heartwarming', 'LOVED', 'how', 'classic', 'music', '1st', '2', 'Harry', 'potter', 'movies', 'Hogwarts', 'Express', 'out', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'was', 'richly', 'rewarding', 'conclusion', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'lock', '5', 'stars']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

1241482,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B001UV4XIS,Midge,"[2, 10]","This terrible director, David Yates managed to butcher 2 of the Potter films.... Half blood prince and now the Deathly Hallows part 2. Some of these narcissistic directors think they have to put their own spin on rewriting movies for their own egos... despite the fact that the hundreds of millions of fans already liked the books as they were written and want to see a reasonable facsimile of the book they read... not some unrecognizable derivative by an ego-centric director who only cares about his own self gratification and not the audience.The scenes were almost unrecognizable. The director managed to change the events in nearly every scene. Even the actors did not have their hearts in it. For the first time since the series began, they were simply reading the words of the script without any heart in what they were saying. It was obvious they also knew how the director was making a butchered, empty rewritten version of the final scenes... but their contracts usually prohibit them from making any negative remarks about the film in perpetuity.Harry didn't even take the time to repair his wand before trashing the elder. They did get rid of the mindless rambling dialogue Rowlings had put into the last book. Some of the new dialogue also makes the details for the reason behind things much clearer... which was helpful... without the senseless babbling and with a lot less rambling words than Rowlings and we did not have to endure any of Rowling's sanctimonious speeches by Harry.I barely recognized some of the scenes. Any high school kid could have made this film as Yates directed it. It is entirely the director's fault. All of his future films should be boycotted after this. He does not deserve to make any more films of any kind.Shell cottage scenes were hacked to bits. The only 2 decent scenes in the entire movie were the scenes from Snapes memory which were excellent, albeit missing huge chunks due to the director's efforts to cut them to shreds. The scenes escaping Gringotts and where Voldemort killed every goblin in Gringotts... was the other portion which was among the better scenes. Some of the special effects of the preemptive spells by the teachers at Hogarts were well done by the special effects CGI artisans.On a good note, Harry's role was less self-centered and less petulant than Rowlings wrote him. It was increasingly obvious in her last 4 books that she was growing tired of the forced deadlines due to the actors age constraints as she wrote the books. She was trying to turn the readers against him as she finished the series in the hope the demand for him would cease. She really wanted to kill him off at the end. At least in the films, this arrogance and self pitying martyrism was greatly diminished and almost totally gone in this last film... none of the insipid arrogance Harry had toward the others like Rowlings had written in the book... so that is one positive aspect of the film. I was also grateful not to have to listen to an entire film filled with the overacting and caustic voice of Bellatrix Lestrange except for the last 2 seconds where we were delighted to see her blasted into oblivion. She was quite muted without more than a few words in this film. I was quite tired of her annoying overacting and cackling. I never understood why she was allowed to get away with her overbearing absurdity in portraying that character. She was so carried away with herself that she actually punctured the eardrum of Neville in the Order of the Phoenix film with her wand in the scene preceeding the death of Sirius Black. The flying scene with Voldemort and Harry at the end of Hallows 2 was also downright absurd... bordering on clownish.It also was a crying shame how the house elf ""Kreature"" had all of his good scenes completely eliminated from both final films. Not one scene where he turned around his attitude after receiving the fake horcrux as a gift.Killing off both Remus and Tonks, Dumbledore (book 6), Snape and one of the Weasely twins by Rowlings was totally unnecessary and cruel... especially in a popular childrens book. It was downright insensitive and unnecessary.But they have used the wrong actress for Ginny since the beginning. There was never any spark between their characters (Harry & Ginny) on the screen. She was actually better suited for Neville. Hermione also was not a good match with Ron Weasely either and the kiss in the chamber was ill timed. There was a better spark between Hermione and Harry on Deathly Hallows pt 1 and in the Half Blood prince when Harry consoled her during the Lavender episode. The makeup and costume depts  did a bad job on Luna. She barely looked like herself.The dialogue and on-screen time for most of the supporting actors roles are almost nonexistent. Mr Weasely was only briefly in a couple scenes without any dialogue at all. If you blink your eyes, you will miss him. Every scene you can imagine has been rewritten by this mindless APE of a director and watered down into hastened, hacked apart, cheap snapshots. He did a worse hack job on this movie than he did in Half blood prince which was a travesty in the hands of this butcher. Remember how every scene from book 6 was filmed in yellow lighting? It was bad enough to see his destruction of the storyline... but the yellow hue to all the lighting in the Half Blood prince was simply awful and distorted every frame of that film. Yates has no business as a director... much less over the highest money grossing films of all time.It was really sad to see the actors with their hearts not in their acting scenes on this final movie. Everything was flat and lifeless.A dismal end to a fabulous series.I am concerned about Emma Watson. In the previews on the DVD, she looked extremely skeletal and had cut off her hair like a boy. She looks quite severely anorexic. She may have a serious eating disorder. She looks like Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby who also looked exactly like this. I hope someone helps her before the eating disorder seriously damages her like the late Karen Carpenter.As for the Ultra violet... avoid buying them if you can. It is like putting a vicious virus full of spyware to search and destroy files on your computer without your permission. Your antivirus software will not remove it as a friendly program. DON'T USE THE DISC IN YOUR COMPUTER. DON'T BUY ULTRAVIOLET IF THERE IS ANY OTHER CHOICE. You will have a heck of a time trying to remove all of the UV spyware and damaging files after using an ultraviolet disc. The only way to get rid of it unless you are a computer expert... would be to wipe the drive and reload the operating system from scratch... and that would destroy all your files if you were not careful to back them up. Unfortunately, they forced UV upon us this time... but it will be the last time and it will never be played on my computer. I can live without other non-potter movies if they insist on adding UV. I only made an exception on Harry Potter because there was no other way to get it on DVD...Forget the blue-ray trash as well. It is only a scam to get more money out of you and force your media purchases under the control of one company who holds the patent. With a monopoly, this one company will control the prices as high as they dare as well as control your options on what you can buy since there will not be any competition. They want to get rid of all VHS which allowed you to copy free from TV and they want to get rid of inexpensive DVD's to ensnare all video consumers into their net... and by net I'm talking about a snare or trap not a network. Be sure to buy older DVD recorder models because they are trying to control what you record from TV now as well. The older models don't have these. This same type of maneuvering is going on with TIVO and DVR. They can actually delete things you record remotely... and have already done so. Just ask people who had copied Ventura's Conspiracy Theory episodes. The Crooks Ventura exposed in the episode about the water stealing scam raised heck so the DVR's from various vendors ALL did a mysterious upgrade which wiped out only those disputed episodes from that one series and none others... in every home across the country... except for those which had their remote access disconnected.As a retired engineer, I worked with a lot of technologies like this and the plans they have for future uses. It would take volumes for me to list everything. Most of you are too young to understand the depth of greed and the control capabilities of these designers of new technologies. Your love of technology will end up eliminating your freedoms, your privacy and your collections. Everyone will end up losing a lot more than they bargained for from the blind love of technology which these entities will use to control everyone and everything. By the time anyone realizes what has happened it will be much too late. This has already happened in other industries which are now controlled by super corporations like Monsanto, Microsoft, GE, Onstar, etc.Stick with plain DVD. The other format manufacturers can't change what they can't sell and the DVD's are quite inexpensive. If you don't buy these other formats, they will stop making them. They won't have a choice.Remember... most people who defend these scam formats usually work for the manufacturer or dealer. They always yell the loudest because they are the ones who have something to lose. It is the honest people who try to warn you of the pitfalls... while the crooks defend it.",3,Bad director butchered a great story,1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,9525,"['terrible', 'director', 'David',

Very well made - even though I have read the book close to 5 times and knew what would happen, the movie still kept me at the edge of my seat. Neville didn't disappoint, Ron was OK, too bad Bellatrix didn't have more screen time, Snape was great as always.In short - I wish Rowling had written a couple more before the final final ending.

For me blue ray is fine and having the standard DVD with it for now is nice if you still have devices that don't have blue ray drives on hand like I do. So all the issues people were having w/ Ultraviolet and digital rights/availability are not an issue for me and my rating is based on the film itself.This is now one of my favorites of the Harry Potter films, perhaps the one I like the best of all. Well done! A really fitting end to this series, it doesn't disappoint, brings all the loose ends together neatly and retains the ""epic adventure"" aspect of the earlier films. Plus, it offers a more mature moral, ethical, and philosophical ""message"" in its content that is understated in the other films but rightly so. The characters are just now at adulthood where the depth of these issues becomes meaningful and realized.After watching it I went back and watched Part 1 again. I was disappointed in Part 1 the first time around and did not find it up to par with the other films - thought it was dull, the plot dragged, and lacked the innovative and engaging aspects and little details of Rowling's ""world"" that the other films demonstrated. I have to say that Part I seems much much better to me after watching Part 2, especially given the culmination of the deeper messaging I just described in the above paragraph of this review.Overall I have been really pleased with this series of films and found the end of the story to be well executed and satisfying despite that they are a children's story. But then again this was the original intent of Star Wars and Tolkien wrote the Hobbit initially for his own children.Adult friends of mine suggested I read the Potter books and so I have started on the first, breezing through it of course. Rowling is no Tolkien, let me just say that. The story elements engage, but the writing is remarkably curt and pedestrian, even for a children's novel. I have been told this improves/becomes more age appropriate as one moves on through the books, though.I must say I enjoy and am thoroughly entertained by the little world and characters Rowling has created and so enjoy the films immensely no doubt due to the high quality of the productions as far as script, direction, acting, costume, sets, and effects are concerned.Top notch all the way around. I recommend the entire series if you enjoy the fantasy genre but struggle to find HIGH QUALITY production outside of the LOTR series.",5,hallows pt 2 -  3 disc DVD blue ray ultraviolet copy combo,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,2648,"['do', 'not', 'give', 'hoot', 'availability', 'digital', 'copies', 'not', 'something', 'use', 'care', 'once', 'film', '10', '12', 'years', 'old', 'will', 'be', 'streaming', 'place', 'subscription', 'service', 'anyway', 'blue', 'ray', 'fine', 'having', 'standard', 'DVD', 'now', 'nice', 'still', 'have', 'devices', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'blue', 'ray', 'drives', 'hand', 'do', 'So', 'issues', 'people', 'were', 'having', 'w/', 'Ultraviolet', 'digital', 'rights/availability', 'are', 'not', 'issue', 'rating', 'based', 'film', 'itself.This', 'now', 'one', 'favorites', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'Well', 'done', 'really', 'fitting', 'end', 'series', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'loose', 'together', 'neatly', 'epic', 'adventure', 'aspect', 'earlier', 'films', 'more', 'mature', 'moral', 'ethical', 'philosophical', 'message', 'content', 'understated', 'other', 'films', 'rightly', 'so', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'now', 'adulthood', 'where', 'depth', 'issues', 'becomes', 'meaningful', 'realized.After', 'watching', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'Part', '1', 'again', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Part', '1', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'up', 'par', 'other', 'films', 'thought', 'was', 'dull', 'plot', 'dragged', 'lacked', 'innovative', 'engaging', 'aspects', 'little', 'details', 'Rowling', 'world', 'other', 'films', 'demonstrated', 'have', 'say', 'Part', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'watching', 'Part', '2', 'especially', 'given', 'culmination', 'deeper', 'messaging', 'just', 'described', 'above', 'paragraph', 'review.Overall', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'pleased', 'series', 'films', 'found', 'end', 'story', 'be', 'well', 'executed', 'satisfying', 'are', 'children', 'story', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'original', 'intent', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Tolkien', 'wrote', 'Hobbit', 'initially', 'own', 'children.Adult', 'friends', 'mine', 'suggested', 'read', 'Potter', 'books', 'so', 'have', 'started', 'first', 'breezing', 'course', 'Rowling', 'Tolkien', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'story', 'elements', 'engage', 'writing', 'remarkably', 'curt', 'pedestrian', 'even', 'children', 'novel', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'more', 'age', 'appropriate', 'one', 'moves', 'books', 'though.I', 'must', 'say', 'enjoy', 'am', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'little', 'world', 'characters', 'Rowling', 'created', 'so', 'enjoy', 'films', 'immensely', 'doubt', 'due', 'high', 'quality', 'productions', 'as', 'far', 'script', 'direction', 'acting', 'costume', 'sets', 'effects', 'are', 'concerned.Top', 'way', 'recommend', 'entire', 'series', 'enjoy', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'struggle', 'find', 'HIGH', 'QUALITY', 'production', 'LOTR', 'series']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

I can't say that it is especially climactic. The film suffers from being separated from ""Part 1"" and left to simply play out the final battle. ""Part 2"" isn't as strong as ""Part 1"", dramatically or thematically, and it is disorienting to pick up the story on the beach just after Dobby the Elf has been buried. Now the trio of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) conspire to break into Bellatrix Lestrange's (Helena Bonham Carter) vault at Gringott's in search of another of Voldemort's horcruxes, in which the Dark Lord harbors a part of his soul. From there it is on to Hogwart's, now under virtual marshal law, to prepare to confront Voldemort face-to-face.This material would have fared better if Warner Brothers hadn't split Harry Potter's final year into two films. All of the thematic substance and dramatic tension were in ""Part 1"", so we have forgotten about it in the intervening months. Talk of the Deathly Hallows is easily confused with the horcruxes, as they are both objects being sought, and the audience has probably forgotten why. This film is dedicated to the final battle, which is anticlimactic, because the build-up that would make the confrontation with Voldemort significant was in the earlier film. Meaningful interaction between characters is limited, in favor of action, so the actors just seem to be going through the motions. There is plenty of superfluous material that could have been cut from both films to create a single 3-hour-plus extravaganza. Bifurcating the finale doesn't do it justice.As both parts of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" are available on DVD now, one might be tempted to watch them back-to-back. That might make ""Part 2"" more coherent, suspenseful, and give it some context, but I doubt that children or most adults will have the patience for a four-and-a-half-hour marathon. The unnecessary scenes will be all the more apparent. If Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh were able to compress ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" into 3 hours and 20 minutes, David Yates and Steve Clove should have been able to do the same with Harry Potter. As it is, ""Part 2"" is mediocre at best.",3,"Unfortunately, All of the Dramatic Tension and Thematic Substance Were in Part 1.",1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2317,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '2', 'two-hour', 'action-packed', 'conclusion', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'saga', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'especially', 'climactic', 'film', 'suffers', 'being', 'separated', 'Part', '1', 'left', 'simply', 'play', 'out', 'final', 'battle', 'Part', '2', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'Part', '1', 'dramatically', 'thematically', 'disorienting', 'pick', 'up', 'story', 'beach', 'just', 'Dobby', 'Elf', 'been', 'buried', 'Now', 'trio', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'conspire', 'break', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'vault', 'Gringott', 'search', 'Voldemort', 'horcruxes', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'part', 'soul', 'Hogwart', 'now', 'virtual', 'marshal', 'law', 'prepare', 'confront', 'Voldemort', 'face-to-face.This', 'material', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'better', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'had', ""n't"", 'split', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'final', 'year', 'two', 'films', 'thematic', 'substance', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'were', 'Part', '1', 'have', 'forgotten', 'intervening', 'months', 'Talk', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'easily', 'confused', 'horcruxes', 'are', 'objects', 'being', 'sought', 'audience', 'probably', 'forgotten', 'why', 'film', 'dedicated', 'final', 'battle', 'anticlimactic', 'build-up', 'would', 'make', 'confrontation', 'Voldemort', 'significant', 'was', 'earlier', 'film', 'Meaningful', 'interaction', 'characters', 'limited', 'favor', 'action', 'actors', 'just', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'plenty', 'superfluous', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'films', 'create', 'single', '3-hour-plus', 'extravaganza', 'Bifurcating', 'finale', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice.As', 'parts', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'now', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'watch', 'back-to-back', 'might', 'make', 'Part', '2', 'more', 'coherent', 'suspenseful', 'give', 'context', 'doubt', 'children', 'most', 'adults', 'will', 'have', 'patience', 'four-and-a-half-hour', 'marathon', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'apparent', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Fran', 'Walsh', 'were', 'able', 'compress', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', '3', 'hours', '20', 'minutes', 'David', 'Yates', 'Steve', 'Clove', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'same', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Part', '2', 'mediocre', 'best']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

In this finale, Harry is indeed the focus as he must face Lord Voldemort once and for all and to the death.  Ralph Fiennes continues his great work as the evil Lord.  This movie also ties up a lot of loose ends and neatly shows us how certain events really took place.  I have to give myself credit for spotting one of those twists some time back.My only beef with this whole series involves Harry and his inability to strike up a real romance with anyone.  He has eyes for Ginny (Bonnie Wright) but she's rarely around and even less so in this finale.  The production value here is as good as any movie out there.  The film is dark, scary and ominous throughout.  As the series progressed and the kids aged so does the tone tends to darken as well.David Yates takes the director's chair again and doesn't disappoint.  Steve Kloves continues as he has from the beginning, to interpret Rowling's books with honesty and consistency.  Warner Bros. should also be congratulated for somehow managing to keep all the key actors together for 10 year and allow us to watch them grow and mature.  This has been a wonderful adventure which concludes with a flourish and a more than satisfying ending; including the epilog that shows our heroes 19 year into the future.  Now it's time to break out the hankies.1-12-11:  Blu ray update.  This film is displayed in 2.40:1 anamorphic wide screen.

With Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, the movie series comes to a very satisfying conclusion. Make sure you are up to date on the other movies, especially the last two. You will probably still enjoy it, but you won't know what in the world is going on, other than the fact that Harry and Voldemorte are going to fight by the end.I'm not a huge fan of what David Yates done directing the last four Harry Potter movies. I liked all the films, but it seems he lacks the ability to give every character the proper amount of screen time and he drains out some of the fun by using a darker looking color for filming, to go along with the much darker material. The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 was good, although I found it rather slow, spending too much time with the kids running around in the woods, but it was more of a setup for the chaos that Part 2 delivers.You want tons of action without sacrificing the emotional connection? Got to love that Snape flashback sequence. Yates got it right this time. I'm having a hard time ranking any of the previous 7 movies ahead of this one. How often can you say that about any long running series? The visuals are better than ever and the musical score is the closest thing to what the great John William's accomplished in the first three Harry Potter films. Most of the cast, roles big and small, are back and it feels almost like we know them personally by now. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have grown before our eyes sure, but the real magic is in how they have grown as actors. Alan Rickman as Snape is still my favorite character in the series. Nobody could play that part any better. Ralph Fiennes also does an excellent job turning up the menace as the snake nosed Voldemorte.The movie ends with an epilogue set 19 years later. They re-shot this segment after seeing how silly the old age prosthetics looked on the actors, but the CGI touches they ended up going with were good in being less distracting, though they looked maybe 5-10 years older tops.It's sad to see this franchise end, but through the power of Blu-ray or whatever muggle invention the future holds, Hogwarts will always be a button or two away.By the way, I saw it in IMAX 3-D and I don't feel it was worth the extra cash. If it was filmed with IMAX cameras or at least shot in 3-D it would have given Transformers: Dark of the Moon a run for it's 3-D visuals.",5,Talk about ending on a high note,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,2525,"['So', 'end', 'eight', 'movie', 'long', 'decade', 'run', 'films', 'somehow', 'managed', 'not', 'have', 'stinker', 'bunch', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '2', 'movie', 'series', 'very', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'Make', 'sure', 'are', 'up', 'date', 'other', 'movies', 'especially', 'last', 'two', 'will', 'probably', 'still', 'enjoy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'world', 'going', 'other', 'fact', 'Harry', 'Voldemorte', 'are', 'going', 'fight', 'end.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'what', 'David', 'done', 'directing', 'last', 'four', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'liked', 'films', 'ability', 'give', 'character', 'proper', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'out', 'fun', 'using', 'darker', 'looking', 'color', 'filming', 'go', 'along', 'much', 'darker', 'material', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '1', 'was', 'good', 'found', 'rather', 'slow', 'spending', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'kids', 'running', 'around', 'woods', 'was', 'more', 'setup', 'chaos', 'Part', '2', 'delivers.You', 'want', 'tons', 'action', 'sacrificing', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Got', 'love', 'Snape', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'got', 'right', 'time', ""'m"", 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'ranking', 'previous', '7', 'movies', 'ahead', 'one', 'How', 'often', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'long', 'running', 'series', 'visuals', 'are', 'better', 'ever', 'musical', 'score', 'closest', 'thing', 'what', 'great', 'John', 'William', 'accomplished', 'first', 'three', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'Most', 'cast', 'big', 'small', 'are', 'back', 'almost', 'know', 'personally', 'now', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'have', 'grown', 'eyes', 'sure', 'real', 'magic', 'how', 'have', 'grown', 'actors', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'still', 'favorite', 'character', 'series', 'Nobody', 'could', 'play', 'part', 'better', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'turning', 'up', 'menace', 'snake', 'nosed', 'Voldemorte.The', 'movie', 'epilogue', 'set', '19', 'years', 'later', 're-shot', 'segment', 'seeing', 'how', 'silly', 'old', 'age', 'prosthetics', 'looked', 'actors', 'CGI', 'touches', 'ended', 'up', 'going', 'were', 'good', 'being', 'less', 'distracting', 'looked', 'maybe', '5-10', 'years', 'older', 'tops.It', 'sad', 'see', 'franchise', 'end', 'power', 'Blu-ray', 'muggle', 'invention', 'future', 'Hogwarts', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'button', 'two', 'way', 'saw', 'IMAX', '3-D', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'worth', 'extra', 'cash', 'was', 'filmed', 'IMAX', 'cameras', 'least', 'shot', '3-D', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Transformers', 'Dark', 'Moon', 'run', '3-D', 'visuals']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

But that's ok, I have no shame, it was touching and I think it did justice to the finale of the book series.  If you haven't seen the other movies, don't bother with this review, go watch the first one.  They are meant to be enjoyed in order.Continuing where the first book left off, Harry and co have buried Dobie and decide to search for the remaining horcruxes.  This involves dangerous forays into Gringotts and also back to Hogwarts itself.  But there are secrets Harry must know, secrets that could effect everything that he knows.  Voldemort's army is growing and becoming more dangerous day by day.  As Harry searches for the remaining Horcruxes within Hogwarts, Voldemort starts battering its defenses for the final showdown.Characters:Daniel Radcliffe: Harry PotterRupert Grint: Ron WeasleyEmma Watson: Hermione GrangerHelena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix LestrangeJim Broadbent: Horace SlughornRobbie Coltrane: Rubeus HagridWarwick Davis: Filius FlitwickRalph Fiennes: Lord VoldemoreMichael Gambon: Albus DumbledoreJohn Hurt: OllivanderJason Isaacs: Lucius MalfoyGary Oldman: Sirius BlackAlan Rickman: Severus SnapeMaggie Smith: Minerva McGonagallDavid Thewlis: Remus LupinJulie Walters: Molly WeasleyThe characters, as usual, were wonderful.  All the actors are marvelously placed in their roles and never fail to please.  Radcliffe as Potter rarely fails to please and he plays a very believable Harry.  He made me feel like I was reading the books, and that's always a good thing.  What's great about Radcliffe in the role is that not only does he look like what I envision Harry to be, he has a quiet noble way about him that I associate with Harry's personality.  Surprisingly, Ron and Hermione didn't have as large of roles in this movie.  They usually have more of a part and while they were there, it just didn't seem like the usual showing of their characters.  The side characters were also well done and while I would have liked to see more of them, I was content with it how it was.  My only complaint on characters would be Voldemort.  He just didn't seem very menacing in this particular edition.  In fact, he almost seemed a little weak and granted he was enduring Horcruxes being destroyed, but I thought he would be a lot more violent.  The real standout character was Neville, just like in the books he showed a lot of bravery and fortitude in this one with his actions against Voldemort.The plot follows the book of course although there were some deviations.  But it didn't take away from the enjoyment and if you've only ever watched the movies, it probably wasn't even noticeable.  I still prefer the books (but then again I always do) but the movies are extremely well done.  Not only are they visually stunning with all the special effects, they do carry the plot well.  For the special effects the broom riding is always impressive, but they had a lot of other fight scenes and scenes involving magic that just couldn't be made without the effects. They did some really neat effects involving fire as well. As said before I even teared up at this one which its very rare a movie can make me do that. I just thought that a lot of emotion was portrayed and even though I know its a movie, I felt bad for what the characters were going through. The music too was great and is always very haunting.  Yet, it still fits the movies perfectly and honestly adds to it.Great finale to the movie series and much better than the first part of the Deathly Hallows.  This is one I'll definitely be buying when it comes out.Review by M.

1241509,AMX4202M7D7HV,B001UV4XIS,"M. Secaur ""Meredith Secaur""","[8, 17]","I have been an unashamed Harry Potter fan since the year 2002, after seeing ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" for the first time. The books are without a doubt my favorite fantasy series of all time, and the films some of the best that any major movie studio has ever produced; but that being said, I have to say I was a bit disappointed by the finale as a whole.This has, in my opinion, a lot to do with J.K. Rowling's treatment of the last novel. Up until book six, I had been mesmerized by the depth and uniqueness of the world she had created and felt that the series couldn't possibly have a bummer in it, seeing as how tightly and carefully the plots were wound and how well the characters were written. But after ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", she seemed to lose her grip on the storyline, and ""Half-Blood Prince"" and ""Deathly Hallows"", while both being incredibly important to furthering the plot concerning the intertwined fates of Harry/Lord Voldemort, seemed so full of incredible faults with their respective titular storylines that they were almost non-cohesive to any of the other novels that had come before them and meandering to the point of absurdity. The introduction of the Half-Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows always felt largely contrived and nowhere near as significant a McGuffin as say the Goblet of Fire or the Sorcerer's Stone, and often left me wondering why they were even introduced at all. The gripping mystery that often held me in suspense throughout ""Chamber"", ""Goblet"", or ""Order"" just wasn't there, and the brutal and numerous deaths seemed to be thrown in just to create a shock factor.Although I knew exactly what I was going to see, I viewed this last film simply to achieve closure on a series I dearly loved, and while not my favorite, it was pretty good, despite its faults. While among the most heart-pounding of the Harry Potter films, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 2,"", is easily the most heart-wrenching, ranging from scenes of intense cathartic emotion to all the horrific gore and gristle of war. It usually takes a lot to get me to cry in a movie, but this film had me weeping almost continually for at least the last half-hour.I can't say it was the most enjoyable of the films, because it simply isn't possible to enjoy a movie with so much blood, death and destruction taking place almost every minute; but nevertheless, I liked it, and felt that even the few small changes did much to improve it from the book.The film starts off at a moderately slow pace, the calm before the storm, and then gradually escalates into a full-blown battle between the forces of Good and Evil. I, like many other reviewers agree that not enough time was spent on the minutiae: the more intimate aspects of the battle, or the deeper expositions of the characters, which should have been explored a bit more, seeing as this is the last outing for them; and that many finer points of the plot were glossed over; but all in all, it had a generally good pace throughout. To those who have read the book, it shouldn't be too much of a problem to understand what's going on.At some moments, the gruesomeness got to be a bit much for me--I wish that the general carnage (including several beloved characters) had been lessened from Rowling's vision. In fact, I believe that a little more gore was added. I would have appreciated it if even one or two characters had been spared, if only to lessen the faintly drained, depressing feeling at the end that it wasn't all worth it, even after You-Know-Who has been defeated,  because so many people died in the process.The scriptwriter Steven Kloves did manage to inject a few of his own ideas into the thread, including a re-entrance into the Chamber of Secrets (an incident that was mentioned after-the-fact in the book), or an epic-scale, all-out cat-fight between Harry and Voldemort, in lieu of the cat-and-mouse banter from the pages of the novel. As to the ending, which is different from the book, I like what the he chose to have Harry do with the Elder Wand. It gives a good insight into Harry's ethics versus those of Dumbledore or Voldemort, who both wanted the wand solely for the immense power they would gain from it.As for the score, Alexandre Desplat really hit home with it. It is vastly better than his work on ""DH1"", and the snippets of Nicholas Hooper's ""Dumbledore's Farewell"" and John William's ""Hedwig's Theme"" add an element of nostalgia, particularly in the last scene, that is a welcome addition for the final installment.All of the actors and actresses give their all for this last Potter outing, and there isn't one among them that gives a bad performance. Particularly outstanding this final time around is Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and Daniel Radcliffe as the ubiquitous Harry Potter. The scene between them in the boathouse had me sobbing my eyes out, as did the scene with the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest. There is no doubt in my mind that both sorely deserve an Academy Award for the sheer brilliance of their performances, and make watching this movie worthwhile, if only to see them so expertly practicing their craft.Alan Rickman probably has the most screen time of anyone except for Harry himself, due to numerous flashback sequences in the Pensieve, in which Snape's whole arcane history is revealed, albeit somewhat quickly. Rickman is simply incredible, and manages to build sympathy for a character whom most people probably little more than entirely despised as only a true actor can.Daniel Radcliffe, a person whom I have always believed to be very talented at what he does, comes out swinging in his final performance as the legendary boy wizard. He gives the character such emotional depth and steadfast resolution--he's no longer just Dan Radcliffe playing Harry: he is Harry. I was deeply moved, often to tears, by his outstanding job in this film, something very few actors can achieve with me.To conclude my review, ""DH2"" is not perfect, but the novel wasn't perfect, either. While the film was lacking in spots and certainly had room for improvement, as a fan, I was quite pleased with it, and feel it was a fairly decent ending for the whole Potter series.",3,The End of an

A ton of graphics added in over everything, so that most of the time you aren't sure even what room or area the characters are in.The ending is the worst. The book concluded in a concise fashion, and explained everything in the last ten minutes or so, but the movie left all of that out.

Doyle ""film buff""","[0, 1]","HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Part 2 moves forward where it left off with Dobby's death toward a stunning conclusion with the final violent confrontation between Harry and Lord Voldemort. The richly crafted characters bring a lot of warmth and humor between all of the tense situations, which makes the whole project such a delight to watch.However satisfying the conclusion is, winding up the tale nineteen years later with a grown-up Potter and friends seeing their children off to Hogwart, I found some discomfort in the decision to play many key scenes in almost complete darkness. I repeat here what I said in my review of Part 1: ""Many of the 'dark' scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt."" Still, I think the contrast between light and dark was ""off"" once again in the DVD transfer and too many scenes are underlit and obscured by bad lighting techniques.Having said that, the performances are all first-rate, with all of the British thespians doing fantastic jobs in both leading and pivotal roles. But the standout among all the players is Alan Rickman as ""Snape."" His character is revealed to be much more than the one-dimensional man he seemed to be in earlier chapters. He speaks every word with great authority. And, of course, the other standout is Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, hissing his lines in a threatening manner accompanied everywhere by a slithering snake. Seeing him get his comeuppance is one of the major satisfactions in the whole story.An almost unrecognizable Ciaran Hinds turns up as Aberforth Dumbledore, one of the many ""surprises"" among the supporting players. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do their usual ensemble playing with finesse, embodying their characters more completely than ever.Alexandre Desplat's background score is stirring whether it's being forceful or gentle and is a pleasure to listen to under the closing credits.Summing up: A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series.",5,A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series...,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,2045,"['HARRY', 'POTTER', 'AND', 'THE', 'DEATHLY', 'HALLOWS', 'Part', '2', 'moves', 'forward', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'Dobby', 'death', 'stunning', 'conclusion', 'final', 'violent', 'confrontation', 'Harry', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'richly', 'crafted', 'characters', 'bring', 'lot', 'warmth', 'humor', 'tense', 'situations', 'whole', 'project', 'delight', 'watch.However', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'winding', 'up', 'tale', 'nineteen', 'years', 'later', 'grown-up', 'Potter', 'friends', 'seeing', 'children', 'Hogwart', 'found', 'discomfort', 'decision', 'play', 'many', 'key', 'scenes', 'almost', 'complete', 'darkness', 'repeat', 'here', 'what', 'said', 'review', 'Part', '1', 'Many', ""'dark"", 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'dark', 'eye', 'comfort', 'then', 'whole', 'story', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'brooding', 'impending', 'evil', 'erupt', 'Still', 'think', 'contrast', 'light', 'dark', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'underlit', 'obscured', 'bad', 'lighting', 'techniques.Having', 'said', 'performances', 'are', 'first-rate', 'British', 'thespians', 'doing', 'fantastic', 'jobs', 'leading', 'pivotal', 'roles', 'standout', 'players', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'character', 'revealed', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'man', 'seemed', 'be', 'earlier', 'chapters', 'word', 'great', 'authority', 'course', 'other', 'standout', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'hissing', 'lines', 'threatening', 'manner', 'accompanied', 'everywhere', 'slithering', 'snake', 'Seeing', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'one', 'major', 'satisfactions', 'whole', 'story.An', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'up', 'Aberforth', 'Dumbledore', 'one', 'many', 'surprises', 'supporting', 'players', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'do', 'usual', 'ensemble', 'playing', 'finesse', 'embodying', 'characters', 'more', 'completely', 'ever.Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'background', 'score', 'stirring', 'being', 'forceful', 'gentle', 'pleasure', 'listen', 'closing', 'credits.Summing', 'up', 'very', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'epic', 'series']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

Snape's death scene in the movie was handled well. After reading that scene in the book, I thought it was going to be cheesy on film - although I didn't understand why they were in a boathouse instead of the Shrieking Shack.2. Helena Bonham Carter acting as Hermione disguised as Bellatrix by way of poly juice potion. Her work on that role should be a winner for best supporting actress.3. Inclusion of the Prince's Tale (Snape's story), which was basically, the whole reason why Harry Potter was the boy who lived, and the one who could defeat Voldemort.LACKING:1. Explanation of the Deathly Hallows - Harry was in possession of all three - the Elder Wand for having won it from Draco, the resurrection stone - gave no background on where it originally came from (Voldemort's family), and the invisibility cloak, which Harry had inherited from his father, but the movie didn't even hint that HIS cloak was THE cloak. Also, since he owned all 3 deathly hallows, he was invincible, and thus escaped death. I'm not so sure that anyone watching only the movie would even understand how Harry came back to life.2. Explanation of the last horcruxes: the goblet in the bank belonged to Helga Hufflepuff - no mention whatsoever of that rather important detail, which leads to Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem possibly being a horcrux. The snake being a horcrux - didn't show how Voldemort came into possession of the snake and why it was chosen.3. Why Molly Weasley was at Hogwart's.4. Snape and Minerva's duel was rather boring - Snape was chased off by 3 wizards in the book.5. Too much screen time for the gray lady without even telling her story.6. Draco's companion, Vincent Crabbe, in the room of requirement. Maggie Smith was battling breast cancer and managed to play Minerva, but Jamie Waylett couldn't get his act together.7. Dumbledore's story and how he himself had sought possession of the deathly hallows. The movie shows his brother and sister, but doesn't explain why she's a child or why his brother harbors resentment.8. AND THE BIGGEST - After Harry kills Voldemort, NO ONE seems to notice. They're just sitting around chitchatting with each other as though they're waiting for the director to shout, ""Action!"" Um, hello, Voldemort is gone forever. Doesn't anyone care? No cheers. No acknowledgement. No pat on the back.Some other lacking items are also lacking from the book itself. How some of the characters were killed wasn't discussed in the book either, because everything is from Harry's perspective. He didn't witness most of the battle, because his duty was to destroy the horcruxes, so I won't blame the screenplay on that.All in all, it's still entertaining and worth seeing, especially if you've seen all of the previous movies. Don't watch it if you've missed some of them, because you'll be lost as to what's going on.As a side note: If anyone has a way of getting in touch with Rowling, here's an idea- a prequel TV series, ""Hogwarts: The Marauders Years."" I'm aware Rowling doesn't want to write a prequel, but maybe she'd be open to leaving the actual writing to others, who simply follow her guidelines.

I had heard about them and decided to try them when I found them in large paperback form at my local Walmart (since replaced with hardback).  I got the third book elsewhere (in hardback) and purchased each of the subsequent books as they were issued.I purchased each movie in DVD or VHS (early ones since replaced with DVD) as it came out as well.  I had not seen Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 before I received the DVD and could not turn it off!From the start of the movie it was almost non-stop tension and almost as much action!  You had to keep watching it.  It helped tremendously if you have read the book but it would be exciting anyway.There were a few differences between the book and movie but that was to be expected.  I'm glad they allowed Neville his moment of glory against Nagini.One odd point, though.  At the end with the group older - why did Harry's and Ginny's daughter have red hair like her and both boys have black hair like him?  Similar for Ron and Hermione.  The girl looked like her and the boy looked like him.  A bit overly stereotypical but not enough to detract from the movie.  I just wish they would have put that last comment about Neville in that section.Again - of all the movies, this was the most exciting and impossible to turn away from.

1241534,A14AD0NQTRVVJC,B001UV4XIS,Patrick J. Sullivan,"[8, 21]","Four years after the Harry Potter book series concluded, the accompanying film series finishes up as well with this second half of the screen adaptation of the Deathly Hallows novel. The movie series was overall an impressive achievement and has added to the overall experience of the Harry Potter universe. Nevertheless the films seldom reached the consistently high level of execution that the novels did, and comparisons aside, there have been some false steps along the way. Part 2 of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows contains its share of miscues. But overall it entertains and is particularly successful as an action and adventure experience. Its ending satisfies even while leaving fans wishing the story could continue forever. This review is of the content of the theater release of the movie. It does include SPOILERS.The movie is anchored by several key action sequences. First the infiltration of and escape from the ultra-secure Gringotts Bank, where Harry and his friends hope to find one of the pieces of dark wizard Voldemort's fragmented soul. Then a battle royale at Hogwarts, where former students Harry, Hermione, and Ron join their friends, teachers, and other allies to take on Voldemort's ""Death Eater"" minions - and to frantically hunt for and find a way to destroy another Horcrux or two. Finally comes the long-anticipated showdown between the leaders of the respective sides: Voldemort, the most accomplished wizard born in the last century, versus teenaged Harry Potter, who has somehow bested Voldemort on half a dozen prior occasions without ever being able to finish him off. This meeting is of course different than any of their prior encounters, even the one that took place almost 17 years earlier which cost infant Harry's parents their lives. Each side knows that at least one of the two archenemies will not be walking away from this long-prophesied meeting.In between the action sequences are sprinkled some explanation, a little romance, some attempts at humor that often fall flat, and a little bit of detection. This movie is light on puzzle solving compared to some of the earlier installments. By this time Harry's group has a pretty good idea of where most of the existing Horcruxes are, and it doesn't take long for them to successfully guess where any remaining hidden ones might be. Although the Deathly Hallows - powerful ancient magical adjuncts - provide the story with its name, by the time this final visual chapter of the story opens Harry has realized what his mentor Albus Dumbledore also eventually realized - that to hunt for the Hallows in search of even more power is not the correct path. The Hallows are mainly dangerous and treacherous, and besides that, the goal is not to amass power but to stop Voldemort's murderous ambitions. The Hallows are not the correct tool to use toward achieving that goal. Voldemort himself has provided such a tool by fracturing his soul into multiple parts, the finding and destruction of which (the Horcruxes) will eventually render Voldemort himself mortal.The romance between Harry's best friends Hermione and Ron has taken forever to get off the ground - largely because of Ron's cluelessness. Somehow he eventually realizes that he likes Hermione, begins to suspect that she might return his interest, and most importantly of all realizes that Harry and Hermione have only a platonic and fraternal friendship and they do not care for each other in that way. Although the long-anticipated kiss between the two cannot possibly live up to expectations, at least it provides resolution. Less successful is the seemingly tacked-on romance between Harry himself and Ron's younger sister Ginny. Where director David Yates and some of his predecessors have really dropped the ball is in failing to develop the Harry-Ginny storyline over the final four movies, in favor of repeatedly hinting at a Harry-Hermione-Ron love triangle and feinting at setting the two best friends up as rivals for Hermione's affections. The result is that it suddenly seems as if Ginny is nothing more than a consolation prize for Harry after he loses out in the Hermione sweepstakes. There is no on-screen spark between Harry and Ginny.The explanation of events within this film is in somewhat short supply and doesn't always occur at the appropriate time. In particular, when Harry finally defeats Voldemort by commanding the allegiance of the wand that Voldemort is wielding, it is not immediately obvious why the wand would suddenly obligingly leap from the dark wizard's hand and toward Harry. Only in a post-fight explanation does Harry detail the chain of events that had already made Harry the true master of this powerful Elder Wand (one of the Deathly Hallows). There are several other such moments, where devoted readers of the book series can probably fill in what happened or at least should have happened, but where movie-only patrons will be left behind.On the other hand, viewers who come to the movies mainly from a book perspective may be disconcerted to find that in the film, Harry defeats Voldemort almost in private, rather than in front of all his followers as in the book. That was key, in order to dispel the myth of Voldemort's invincibility. The book's Voldemort died openly, after first having been reduced to his human origins by Harry, who reminded the self-styled Lord Voldemort and his disciples that he is after all only a man once named Tom Riddle. The movie version of these events leaves the witnesses out and also fails to fully demythologize Voldemort. Although Harry does (bizarrely) call Voldemort ""Tom"" in almost chummy fashion at one point, he never spells it out to Voldemort and his followers that he's really just Tom Riddle, a dark wizard who split his soul into too many pieces and killed way too many people.Another example of a false move is Harry casually destroying the Elder Wand after the battle by snapping it in half. But if the Wand had been that easy to destroy, Dumbledore himself would gladly have performed the deed, since he recognized the extreme danger posed by the Wand and was very alarmed at the prospect of either Harry or Voldemort getting his hands on it.One aspect of the struggle that was not explored thoroughly enough was the recognition of the sacrifices that many of Harry's allies made. Some were injured in the struggle, others were killed - including some who were extremely close to Harry and his friends. The film could have used some formal recognition of these characters and their contributions.The extended Harry Potter cast has grown steadily over the years. There are a large number of well-respected and famous actors occupying the adult roles, in addition to the important roles filled by the younger performers. There has never been enough screen time to give all the characters and their portrayers their due, and in this final chapter there is even less than usual as the overriding emphasis is and must be on the epic struggle between Harry and Voldemort. Actors such as Emma Thompson and Maggie Smith are barely on screen at all. One performer who does receive more than a cameo appearance is Helena Bonham Carter, still playing Bellatrix Lestrange, Voldemort's most murderously effective - and demented - lieutenant. The choice of the slightly dotty Bonham Carter to portray Bellatrix was probably the most inspired casting of the whole film series, and it again pays dividends here. Ralph Fiennes had his work cut out for him in trying to act, and to be menacing, while wearing a somewhat goofy snake-man mask. He manages to surmount the difficulties of the task and provide Harry with a serious foe.But the film ultimately relies on the performances of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron. All three are at least adequate. Grint will not be making the transition to adult film star, but the shortcomings of his character (immaturity and anger) should not be lain at his feet. He succeeds in depicting Ron as well as is reasonable to expect, especially given that he was cast in the role half a lifetime ago. Watson is the film series' breakout star, and she has already achieved success outside the film series, in the world of modeling. Whether she sticks with taking advantage of her striking profile and cheekbones by that route or continues her acting career as well, she seems destined to be a celebrity for a long time.Daniel Radcliffe, like Grint, will not ever be a conventional adult movie star. He is not tall enough, for one thing. But he was the perfect choice for the role. I can imagine other actors playing Ron and even Hermione. The series lost one excellent actor as Dumbledore and continued with a replacement without a pause. But Daniel Radcliffe took the role of Harry Potter and made it his forever. The story has repeatedly called for Harry to do impulsive, stupid, angry, and unlikeable things (as well as acting heroically and generously at other times of course). Radcliffe's unenviable task was to keep Harry still basically sympathetic throughout even the worst throes of adolescent petulance. He deserves to be lauded for his success in doing so.The series is over for good, and its like will not soon come along - if ever. The only cure for Potter deprivation is more Potter, and the films, including this one, should have a long lifetime. At some point soon I'll revisit the excellent first movie and then go on from there.",3,"Entertaining and Satisfying, though not Perfect",1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,9461,"['Four', 'years', 'Harry',

That's not to say there weren't some flaws in the filming...there were. Some of the battles were kind of hard to follow visually, and the very, very end was a little difficult. I feel they should have done a little better with the make-up, or gotten a different lot of actors for the last two or three minutes. That aside, it was kind of back to Potter basics. A continuation of the theme with a quest at hand, a discovery of unheralded bravery, disclosure of the finer plot details, and a final confrontation, with some surrealist moments mixed in to change the pace and further the plot.I see this movie wasnt well received in the reviews here, but i enjoyed the movie and thought it was an almost perfect closure of the series.

1241549,A3S4B0BHMN5SEN,B001UV4XIS,PrestonP,"[0, 0]","It all ended for millions of Harry Potter fans, many dressed in their witchcraft and wizardry outfits, with laughs and tears as J.K. Rowling's life work, that spanned over second novels, eight motion pictures, a theme-park ""land"", countless other licensing merchandise, and 14 years (more than half of most of those that are reading this's lives), epically concluded.  This review will remain as spoiler free as possible however if you have not seen at the very least Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 do not read this or see the movie beforehand.  Part 2 wastes no time in starting the story and one would be utterly lost throughout the entire film.Again the movie picks up just minutes after Part 1 ended with Voldemort (brilliantly played by Ralph Fiennes) grave robbing the great Professor Dumbledore's grave for one of the ""deathly hallows,"" the omnipotent ""elder wand.""  From there two hours and ten minutes are filled with the heroes Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), his red-headed sidekick Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Harry's other best friend, Ron's love interest and all around know-it-all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the rest of the Order of the Phoenix seeking the destruction of Voldemort's evil ways and defending Hogwarts castle in a showdown for the ages.The real show stealer is Potter MVP Alan Rickman who plays Severus Snape, Harry's long time professor fiend now turned Hogwarts headmaster.  For those that have not read the book again spoilers will be spared but there is an earth shattering revelation about three quarters through the film that showcases Rickman's ability to nail the character of Snape.  If there is ever a reboot of the Potter series, Rickman will be one of the irreplaceable few.  A character that was long despised both in novel and film turns the table on the audience and Rickman gets it every time.While the details will be left spoiler free there is much to be said about the final battle at Hogwarts castle.  Many of the fan favorites, like Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) and Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) return for the latter half of the film.  For longtime Potter-fans  this adds to the ""realism"" of the events to come as wizards and witches start to die.  A large problem that the book had (and perhaps it is the lack of visual cues) is the ""realism"" of what happens.  Reading that women and children died and seeing it on screen are two entirely different events.  Throughout the final scenes there are bodies of students who had fallen in battle strewn throughout the halls of Hogwarts.The final battle between Harry and Voldemort was a tad anticlimactic but then again so too was it that way in the book.  Credit is given to the film makers for the visual representation of spell casting.  Where sword fights are easily depicted through the back and forth blows the opponents dish out, spell casting was never that way in the book.  Here the film improvises like they always have.  This is especially good in the Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) battle.Here is a good time to mention that the differences between the book and the movie are not factored into the review score.  Of course some changes were for the better and some for the worst but it will be left to the audience to decide that for themselves.  This review is on the film alone.It should be mentioned that the film was not just a studio grab for cash in the decision to break the final episode into two.  After seeing the film it is almost impossible for the two films to have been one three hour experience.The special effects are always great in these films as no expense is spared.  For review it was viewed in an IMAX 3D experience.  Where the 3D was not necessarily an addition to the film, the IMAX definitely was.  Some of the wider battle scenes where there is a lot of nuanced action are better viewed in this fashion and the sound is much more clear and crisp.  Thus IMAX is recommended.Just like the special effects, no expense is spared on the audio effects or soundtrack.  The Harry Potter theme that John Williams wrote for the first film does not make a real appearance until halfway through the film but the utilization of previous themes towards the end is brilliantly executed in the way it brings the nostalgia of a 14 year journey to the audience.While the movie was good by Potter standards (not even the best film of the franchise) it fails in a number of categories that Potter fans will surely backlash.  Much of its shortcomings arise from the failures of previous films that this one has built on.  It spends too much time on secondary and tertiary characters that haven't been referenced in some time and has an anticlimactic ending.  Another downfall lies in the film's skimming over new characters.There is no doubt that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 will break box office records but there is much doubt on its road to the Oscars.

When last we left our hero in part one, England had been completely taken over by Voldemort and his forces. And taken over England looked remarkably like prewar Nazi Germany, Hitler Youth like a far Right-wing take over. Red and black Nazi-ish flags everywhere.Here in the last, Harry Potter and his small cohort of magicians confront the powers of evil incarnate, with pretty predictable results. And predictably, there are always ""surprises"": good guys who turn villains and villains who are secret good guys. And a final battle for the world. Lots of special effects and explosions. Very dark. Go expecting the last two movies to be dark and downbeat nearly from beginning to end. What brightness in color and emotion and happiness that is there only comes in the brief d&eacute;nouement.

1241563,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B001UV4XIS,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[2, 4]","The last installment in the Harry Potter film series, The Deathly Hallows Part Two lives up to the entire Potter filmography.  Everything from the storyline to the action packed scenes between the protagonist and main character Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and antagonist Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), in essence, continuous theme that the story centers upon finding the truth behind Harry's life.  An adventure that has taken Harry from child to young adulthood that has involved his rites of passage as a wizard in a very complex world and all of its complexities.  Viewers who have followed the story through books and films, they too share the experience that Harry and his friends and peers of Hogwarts, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupter Grint) will finally confront by the end of Deathly Hallows, the end of an era but also a beginning.The film contains a wide array of surprises and predictable moments that may appeal to the diehard Harry Potter fan or those just beginning to be exposed to a cavalcade of excitement that is the Potter experience.  The difference between Part one and Part two, is that although both compliment each other, the latter shows much more of a cohesion and progression of the storyline and the characters that finally come full circle; the last two films appeared to lean much more on the adolescent romantic schmooze between the main characters.  But with Part two, Harry is the central focus as well as a few unassuming moments, especially with underdog, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis). With the effective direction and production and cinematography of the film, these factors contributed to climatic scenes that included an assembly of pyrotechnics that resembled something out of The Lord of the Rings and other fantasized films as well as a massive display of force by a band of mobs from Voldemort's camp against Hogwarts, and the subtle ironic and sentimental scenes in the form of flashbacks that Harry recollects in order to find the truth about himself and what had brought him to his present dilemmas.By the end of Deathly Hallows Part Two, viewers may have their own conclusion or expectation of the film.  But as a hint, it is the choice that Harry makes that shows much triumph on his part as well as the people that helped him to overcome what had happened in the past.  And the film does not end without a bit of nostalgia, especially as the Harry Potter jingle, that twinkling melody, waivers in the background, that gives a sense of how far Harry, Hermione, and Ron have come since the first film.  Indeed, this may be a farewell to this chapter in the Harry Potter series, but when watching each and every scene, there is a possibility of another chapter in the life and experience of the boy wizard turned adult that has been left open for more adventures to be had, especially fans who have kept that prospect open.",5,From whence it came,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,2886,"['last', 'installment', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'series', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', 'Two', 'entire', 'Potter', 'filmography', 'Everything', 'storyline', 'action', 'packed', 'scenes', 'protagonist', 'main', 'character', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'antagonist', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'essence', 'continuous', 'theme', 'story', 'centers', 'finding', 'truth', 'Harry', 'life', 'adventure', 'taken', 'Harry', 'child', 'young', 'adulthood', 'involved', 'rites', 'passage', 'wizard', 'very', 'complex', 'world', 'complexities', 'Viewers', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'story', 'books', 'films', 'too', 'share', 'experience', 'Harry', 'friends', 'peers', 'Hogwarts', 'Hermione', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Ron', 'Rupter', 'Grint', 'will', 'finally', 'confront', 'end', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'end', 'era', 'also', 'beginning.The', 'film', 'wide', 'array', 'surprises', 'predictable', 'moments', 'may', 'appeal', 'diehard', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan', 'just', 'beginning', 'be', 'exposed', 'cavalcade', 'excitement', 'Potter', 'experience', 'difference', 'Part', 'one', 'Part', 'two', 'compliment', 'other', 'latter', 'much', 'more', 'cohesion', 'progression', 'storyline', 'characters', 'finally', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'appeared', 'lean', 'much', 'more', 'adolescent', 'romantic', 'schmooze', 'main', 'characters', 'Part', 'two', 'Harry', 'central', 'focus', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'unassuming', 'moments', 'especially', 'underdog', 'Neville', 'Longbottom', 'Matthew', 'Lewis', 'effective', 'direction', 'production', 'cinematography', 'film', 'factors', 'contributed', 'climatic', 'scenes', 'included', 'assembly', 'pyrotechnics', 'resembled', 'something', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'other', 'fantasized', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'massive', 'display', 'force', 'band', 'mobs', 'Voldemort', 'camp', 'Hogwarts', 'subtle', 'ironic', 'sentimental', 'scenes', 'form', 'flashbacks', 'Harry', 'order', 'find', 'truth', 'what', 'had', 'brought', 'present', 'dilemmas.By', 'end', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', 'Two', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'own', 'conclusion', 'expectation', 'film', 'hint', 'choice', 'Harry', 'shows', 'much', 'triumph', 'part', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'helped', 'overcome', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'past', 'film', 'not', 'end', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'especially', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'jingle', 'twinkling', 'melody', 'waivers', 'background', 'sense', 'how', 'far', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron', 'have', 'come', 'first', 'film', 'Indeed', 'may', 'be', 'farewell', 'chapter', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'when', 'watching', 'scene', 'possibility', 'chapter', 'life', 'experience', 'boy', 'wizard', 'turned', 'adult', 'been', 'left', 'open', 'more', 'adventures', 'be', 'had', 'especially', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'kept', 'prospect', 'open']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

This is a magnificent piece of cinema - Academy Award caliber - and I will be surprised if it does not garner multiple awards recognition. No other film this year (2011) has been so universally acclaimed by the professional critics. If this is truly the end, it is a bittersweet moment. Watching Harry and his two closest friends and the actors who play them grow and mature has been almost like watching my children come of age. In this final episode,Harry, Hermione, and Ron continue their search for the Horcruxes upon which Voldemort depends for life. All of us knew from the author, J. K. Rowling, that one of the protagonists would die in this final episode...but if you haven't read the book and you haven't seen this film, I won't spoil it for you...the ending may very well surprise you. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint deliver their finest performances in this final film; and they are supported by a perfectly cast ensemble, most of whom we've seen before...but there are a couple of new faces - Ciaran Hinds, as Dumbledore's brother, Alberforth; and Kelly McDonald as the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw. The special effects are stunning and David Yates work behind the camera is masterful.

Just being in the cinema with people just like me, who lived through their childhoods with these amazing characters, who became our friends we wish existed... A truly phenomenal experience. I had never felt such a sense of togetherness in my life. So to join these diehards in staying up till the very beginning of Friday, July 16th to witness this finale... I must say that experience changed my life.And I do not exaggerate when I call this film the best movie of 2011. Believe me, this film has it all. Action, comedy, suspense, drama, emotional connectivity, amazing performances.Understandably this is the shortest of all the Potter flicks- the previous movie covered 75% of the book, and so this film covers 25%... Which is a good thing because it shows Yates put effort into making this movie a big, grand finale. The movie moves at a fast pace, and boy, is that a good thing. One would worry that it would come off as rushed, but believe me, Yates did a hell of a job here. Sure some things were left out and/or changed, but obviously for pacing purposes. I am aware of the changes, but honestly, as a fan of the book, I'm glad they were made.The acting is what helps make this movie amazing. You could tell the actors were in a ""alright, it's the last movie, let's live it up more than we can"" mood. Everyone hams it up beautifully. The full power of the actors' performances is used. In my opinion, Matthew Lewis was the highlight of the movie! He always was the highlight of the other films, and this movie is no exception. He manages to ham it up as Neville Longbottom, and here he is in full badass mode.Really, I am still speechless as to how awesome this movie was. I mean, I knew it was going to be one emotional experience, and thank god it turned out to be that. As the movie's ending credits began rolling, I got incredibly emotional. I did not want to say goodbye to the phenomenon that helped shape my childhood. And you could feel that emotion running through the cinema, when John Williams' score rang through the speakers.In short, Deathly Hallows 2 is phenomenal, the best of the series, and the best film of 2011. Rarely have I connected with a movie as emotionally as I did with DH2, and that said, this was the right way for me to say goodbye to my childhood properly.OVERALL: 10/10Pros: DH2 is the perfect balance of crowd pleasing and fan service, allowing everyone to have a blast.

Parrish,"[0, 0]","Having never read the books and only inhabiting the world created by the movies themselves I can tell you this came down to an ending that seemed too trite and unmagical for the likes of the Harry Potter I saw grow up on that screen!  Oh the effects are there (tho the 3D is strictly gimmick in these last two films and adds nothing to the overall pop of the story) and the special effects achievements throughout the series are breathtaking in their scope and execution but the story relies too heavily on having read the books.  No offense to Miss Rowling who I'm sure is a superb story teller for her books to have reached the level of worldwide acceptance that they did but the movies seemed a bit formulaic (what with Harry Potter going to Hogwarts from an untenable home each year and fretting over the mystery of the week and vacillating til his confrontation with Voldemort where he found himself rescued by Dumbledore).  My kudos on the change in atmosphere from kiddie fantasy to young adult angst in the last three movies but still when all was said and done and Lord Voldemort lay crumbling in the dust I felt let down somehow and then the scene for 19 years later comes along feeling tacked on and less than successfully visually staged (despite all the tremendous special effects achievement that came before) with Harry, Ron and Hermione looking far far less than 19 years older coming to what is meant to be a full circle having made Hogwarts safe for their own progeny.  To me the magic was deflated and they were mere Muggles again seeing their offspring off.  The books would probably have made all this seem like Grand Opera to me I'm sure as I am vehemently attacked by Potter fans whenever I express my opinion verbally but remember I am judging the films only and in particular the Grand Finale offered by this movie.  Future film historians will dissect the Potter series far more meticulously than I and I will be interested in their views on the subject as well.

1241583,AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B001UV4XIS,"R. M. Ettinger ""rme1963""","[0, 0]","Overall, 'Deathly Hallows pt 2' was still one of the better Harry Potter movies. While I know people thought 'part 1' was bleaker, that actually ranked up there as  my favorite. I like part 1 better than part 2.First off - there was nothing at all wrong with the cinematography, the music, the costumes, lighting or acting. I rather enjoyed the music a lot - and said so even two minutes in.All the actors did an excellent job - the ""kids"" on up. Daniel Radcliffe did a great job in his last outing (except for one horribly stiff line that took me back to how bad he was in the first two movies), and as much as Rupert Grint and Emma Watson had to do with last movie, their parts seemed diminished with this one. That is understandable considering the story arc.It was great seeing that all the Hogwart students were back this time - if you remember last, there was no school in that movie, however, I liked seeing Neville and Seasmus.  But the adult actors did a great job,  and I'm always a big fan of Alan Rickman's Snape, so I can't complain about his performance. You never can - he always hits it out of the ballpark. Ditto with Maggie Smith. Ralph Finnes did an outstanding job.Don't blink or you'll miss Emma Thompson's four seconds and the guy who played Ron's dad.The movie was really good, but still lacking.  My opinion of course.With all the other movies, I heard people complain about what was missing from the books, which is not unusual for any movie adaptation - and usually those gaps didn't affect me or how I thought the movie turned out. This time, it did.One part was material that was missing. With one sentence - one! - they skipped about 70 pages of the book, all having do do with Dumbledore and his relationship with his family and one Gellert Grindelwald. It was big point in the book about the search for the Deathly Hallows and the grasp for their power. ....and that whole implied gay thing.Neville also mentions the Carrows and needing to watch out for them, and while I saw their names in the credits, I'd almost dare you to pick out which scene they were in.There was another part missing for me as well:  the passion. (and there are spoilers if you have not read the book.)I wasn't looking for gratuitous violence, but all the talk of this being a big battle movie, I did kind of think you'd see the deaths of Fred, Remus and Tonks.  It was all after the fact and barely a blip. Where was the connection to their deaths after having been with Fred for 10 years and the other two for the last few?  A few seconds of film to show Ron's reaction to his brother's death didn't really tie me to that emotion.  I think it was a missed opportunity to put some heart into it all. The director does it (to a degree) with Harry and his parents and Sirius, but they don't really allow it with others.And I wanted and needed more of an exciting demise of Bellatrix LeStrange. Maybe I read the scene with a different sense than was conveyed in the movie.  Her fight scene with Molly Weasley was way underplayed....and done much better on Julie Walter's part than Helena Bonham Carter's. Still, it seemed like playing with their wands as opposed to vengence on either of their parts. Actually, it must have taken Bonham Carter longer to get into make-up than she was in all of this film.  (Side note:  I did enjoy Hermione's voice coming out of her as she tried to portray Bellatrix early in the movie, but there was a flaw with that when going to Gringotts - I'll let you see if you catch it.)Going back to Neville, and again, maybe I read it with a different perspective, but the killing of the snake was just 'meh' here. I remember rereading it several times to make sure that Neville, not Harry, was in some ways the actual hero of the day.The last point was the epilogue. There was a point in the book that described Malfoy at the train station that should have been more poignant. It wasn't.....at least for me. Malfoy was shown for all of 0.04 seconds. The shot conveyed nothing.For all the hoo-hah about having to reshoot that epilogue, my first thought was - 'wow, how bad was the first version?""  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't tear inducing or anything.",4,Pt 2 - Still a Fitting End,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,4183,"['Overall', ""'Deathly"", 'Hallows', 'pt', '2', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'better', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'know', 'people', 'thought', ""'part"", '1', 'was', 'bleaker', 'actually', 'ranked', 'up', 'there', 'favorite', 'part', '1', 'better', 'part', '2.First', 'was', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'cinematography', 'music', 'costumes', 'lighting', 'acting', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'lot', 'said', 'so', 'even', 'two', 'minutes', 'in.All', 'actors', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'kids', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'last', 'outing', 'one', 'horribly', 'stiff', 'line', 'took', 'back', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'as', 'much', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'had', 'do', 'last', 'movie', 'parts', 'seemed', 'diminished', 'one', 'understandable', 'considering', 'story', 'arc.It', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'Hogwart', 'students', 'were', 'back', 'time', 'remember', 'last', 'was', 'school', 'movie', 'however', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Neville', 'Seasmus', 'adult', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', ""'m"", 'always', 'big', 'fan', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'performance', 'never', 'can', 'always', 'ballpark', 'Ditto', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Ralph', 'Finnes', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job.Do', ""n't"", 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'four', 'seconds', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Ron', 'dad.The', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'still', 'lacking', 'opinion', 'course.With', 'other', 'movies', 'heard', 'people', 'complain', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'books', 'not', 'unusual', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'usually', 'gaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'affect', 'how', 'thought', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'time', 'did.One', 'part', 'was', 'material', 'was', 'missing', 'one', 'sentence', 'one', 'skipped', '70', 'pages', 'book', 'having', 'do', 'do', 'Dumbledore', 'relationship', 'family', 'one', 'Gellert', 'Grindelwald', 'was', 'big', 'point', 'book', 'search', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'grasp', 'power', '.and', 'whole', 'implied', 'gay', 'thing.Neville', 'also', 'Carrows', 'needing', 'watch', 'out', 'saw', 'names', 'credits', ""'d"", 'almost', 'dare', 'pick', 'out', 'scene', 'were', 'in.There', 'was', 'part', 'missing', 'well', 'passion', 'are', 'spoilers', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'talk', 'being', 'big', 'battle', 'movie', 'did', 'kind', 'think', ""'d"", 'see', 'deaths', 'Fred', 'Remus', 'Tonks', 'was', 'fact', 'barely', 'blip', 'Where', 'was', 'connection', 'deaths', 'having', 'been', 'Fred', '10', 'years', 'other', 'two', 'last', 'few', 'few', 'seconds', 'film', 'show', 'Ron', 'reaction', 'brother', 'death', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'tie', 'emotion', 'think', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'put', 'heart', 'director', 'degree', 'Harry', 'parents', 'Sirius', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'allow', 'others.And', 'wanted', 'needed', 'more', 'exciting', 'demise', 'Bellatrix', 'LeStrange', 'Maybe', 'read', 'scene', 'different', 'sense', 'was', 'conveyed', 'movie', 'fight', 'scene', 'Molly', 'Weasley', 'was', 'way', 'underplayed', '.and', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'Julie', 'Walter', 'part', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Still', 'seemed', 'playing', 'wands', 'opposed', 'vengence', 'parts', 'Actually', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'longer', 'get', 'make-up', 'was', 'film', 'Side', 'note', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Hermione', 'voice', 'coming', 'tried', 'portray', 'Bellatrix', 'early', 'movie', 'there', 'was', 'flaw', 'when', 'going', 'Gringotts', ""'ll"", 'let', 'see', 'catch', 'Going', 'back', 'Neville', 'again', 'maybe', 'read', 'different', 'perspective', 'killing', 'snake', 'was', 'just', ""'meh"", 'here', 'remember', 'rereading', 'several', 'times', 'make', 'sure', 'Neville', 'not', 'Harry', 'was', 'ways', 'actual', 'hero', 'day.The', 'last', 'point', 'was', 'epilogue', 'was', 'point', 'book', 'described', 'Malfoy', 'train', 'station', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'poignant', 'was', ""n't"", '..at', 'least', 'Malfoy', 'was', 'shown', '0.04', 'seconds', 'shot', 'conveyed', 'hoo-hah', 'having', 'reshoot', 'epilogue', 'first', 'thought', 'was', ""'wow"", 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'first', 'version', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'tear', 'inducing', 'anything']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

1241588,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B001UV4XIS,Robin Simmons,"[0, 0]","Joanne Rowling's compelling, addictive adventure of the boy wizard has been officially translated into about 70 languages.  Each movie adapted from the seven books made about a billion bucks (excluding home video).  Total gross for home video and books has been estimated at an additional $10 billion - give or take a few million.  Today, Ms. Rowling is among the richest woman in the UK.  But that was not always so.When she began writing, she was essentially out of work and broke.  But during a delay on a train from Manchester to London, she said that a story fully formed percolated and spilled out on scribbled napkin notes.  And it continued to flow and flow and flow.  By luck, an obscure literary agent plucked her unsolicited manuscript from a pile and immediately was transported into the world of the story.  That first volume made publishing history - as did those that followed.  Meticulous film adaptations with detailed production design and remarkable casting, directing acting, music and effects reflected the reading experience.Much has been written about this pop-culture phenomenon, but perhaps the main attraction is the coming of age in a world of good and evil and danger and responsibility where fear and desire rub up against each other.  Somehow we all know that just beyond the ordinary and mundane are extraordinary wonders and mysteries and this massive tale latches onto that core theme.In some conservative circles, the books and movies were denounced as fostering in vulnerable young readers an unhealthy interest in dark, supernatural powers.The publisher, fearing young boys would be put off by a female author, used only her initials to mask her gender.  She also kept quiet about her own embrace of Christianity.With the release of the last half of ""Deathly Hallows,"" the entire story can now be enjoyed in a thrilling, magical marathon viewing extravaganza.Beautifully acted, the final showdown is a dazzling and satisfying conclusion to the epic drama of warring good and evil and the role of human responsibility.Not too much can be said about the perfect casting of young Daniel Radlciffe as Potter.  He not only matches the book cover art but also the essence of the character as portrayed on the novels' pages.  Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are similarly perfect as Potter's Hogwarts' mates.  But what's most amazing to witness, especially at one sitting, is the actual coming of age of these terrific young actors.  The stakes are very high indeed and there is no guarantee of safety for anyone when Harry is faced with the ultimate sacrifice as he makes a final stand against Lord Valdemort.

This one was a real pain.  The digital copy steps were first, go to a special website; second, download their special software (and don't forget to read the terms and conditions, over a hundred small screens worth).  Install their software and use it to download the movie.  Then you can ""watch the movie!""Well, according to QuickTime it uses an unknown codec.  iTunes won't let me copy it in.

1241596,A1BPCX5TX2HNRQ,B001UV4XIS,Russ Nickel,"[158, 197]","In this superb conclusion to the tale we've been following for over a decade, the intrepid Harry Potter finds that only by satisfying his hankering for Horcruxes can he hope to defeat the dark lord. Most of the film is spent following his search for these last few objects, and what could have been a tedious series of fetch quests is kept from falling into the realms of boredom by a sense of pacing so perfect the future film student in me started taking notes. Admittedly, my last movie experience was Transformers: Dark of the Moon, a ""film"" with such atrociously jarring momentum that I nearly disgorged my five dollar hot dog (but five dollars is five dollars, so I willed it down). Even though anything will seem well-paced by comparison, I haven't been so blown away by such artful interweaving of action and calm, fear and love, and an ensemble cast, since, well, ever.[Warning: Contains SPOILERS!]The most powerful example of this is when Harry ends up alone in the Forbidden Forest in the middle of the giant showdown between good and evil. After seeing young students cut down by death eaters as they tried to hold their own in a war that was far beyond them, after witnessing stone statues come to life and make battle with club-wielding giants, after bridges burn, forcefields collapse, and spirits break, after dementors are driven off by those who refuse to relinquish their hope, we find ourselves in a clearing of silence.Turning the resurrection stone in hand, Harry is suddenly accompanied by the ghosts of those he cares most deeply for: Sirius, Lupin, and his parents. Their undying love for him brought tears to my eyes, for it is a love that continued into the afterlife not thanks to some magic, but because all those who have left us live on in our hearts. The writing was beautiful, the acting sublime. The calm in the center of the storm, this one scene is a masterpiece of pacing.The rest of the storm was nothing to shake a stick at either, not that shaking a stick at a storm is really that common of an activity. In fact, I'm not sure that it would accomplish much of anything, unless the stick is a wand and you have control over the weather. Then it would definitely help. Anyway, the point of all this is to say that, while the emotional punch packed by Deathly Hallows Part 2 is nothing to shake a wand at, the visuals are equally impressive.For instance, cast your imagination gaze on Gringotts. Its labyrinthine rollercoaster-tangle transportation system is a wild ride that puts every Six Flags everywhere to shame, especially since it ends with a dragon. Now, a lot of movies have done dragons (Harry Potter included), but this was potentially my favorite CGI beastie ever (don't worry, Toothless. No one can replace you). The dragon was not a glorious mount of yore, but rather an emaciated, abject figure, trapped underground for his natural life, chains cutting into his majesty and leaving nothing but raw, bloody hopelessness. The creature instantly evokes overwhelming pity, something I've rarely witnessed from CGI.Dragons are basically my favorite, but if there's one thing I love more, it's love itself. We all knew the Ron Hermione romance was going to come to a head. The only question was, after so many years of buildup, could the climax do it justice? I, for one, say that nothing has ever been more just. You know that moment in truth or dare when someone asks you your most seductive fantasy and you finally let spill the secret you've never told anyone? You launch into graphic detail, explaining that it's all about thrusting your basilisk fang into a goblet-shaped Horcrux in the Chamber of Secrets while under attack from a giant watery snake that eventually comes crashes over you? We've all been there. Everybody gives you these weird looks, as if that's somehow not the hottest thing ever. Ron and Hermione certainly thought it was, because they immediately launch into a passionate kiss that had the theater cheering up a storm.Perhaps the most beautiful scene is the one bathed all in white. Halfway between life and death, Harry finds himself in King's Cross Station, his own personal limbo. There, the sage and mysterious Dumbledore delivers some of the most compelling wisdom in years of cinema. The English major in me rejoiced when such a beloved figure told us that words are the most powerful magic, able to do great harm but also to heal. I'm using words right now, and man do I feel mighty. And when Harry asked ""Is this all just in my head or is it real?"" and Dumbledore responded with ""Of course it's in your head, but that doesn't mean it's not real."" Gah! So sagacious!But enough nonsensical gushing. As perfect as this movie was (and it was), there were still a few things that I would've done differently. The whole series is about the battle between Harry and Voldemort; this is a showdown ten years in the making, and I wanted it to be perfect. The buildup was there, but when the final blow was dealt, it felt understated. Voldemort simply drifts away into nothingness. If it were me, I'd have Harry explain the entire Deathly Hallows wand switching thing while the two of them struggled against each other, beams of energy locked in a pulsing impasse. Then, as soon as it became clear that Harry was going to win, he'd shout ""Avada Kedavra!"" and Voldemort would EXPLODE. That's how a dark lord goes out.In fact, I could go for a lot more spell shouting in general. Aberforth Dumbledore should've bellowed ""Expecto Patronum!"" before taking care of all those dementors, and Molly Weasley definitely needed to scream some serious stuff at Bellatrix before the end. And I know it would've gone against the books and fans everywhere would have gone on a David Yates manhunt, but I could've done without that 19 years later scene. I just don't think it works in the film version.After having been underwhelmed year after year by subpar adaptations of the formative novels of my youth, finally have I received the cinematic experience I've long craved. At long last, we are given epic battles of half-giant proportions, momentous stakes that belie the series' light-hearted origins, and characters whose superb performances tug at our dragon-heart strings. At long last, we have a film that is truly magical.Score: 5/5 Also, let it be noted that Neville is a champion.Check out more on ""The Nickel Screen"" (Google it!)",5,A Perfect Ending!,1311206400,"07

Potter fans dressed up in their favorite school colors from Hogwarts, carrying wands and making like Hermione, Harry and Ron.  The theater did a quick giveaway promotion, a short costume contest and lots of cheering and yelling before the show started.  The place was packed.  Some special fans got their 3D glasses Potter style (round rims).  Even with advance tickets I waited a couple of hours to get in which was annoying, but the infectious crowd lifted my spirits.The Review:The Deathly Hallows picks up where the first movie leaves off.  The Part Two film does not stand on its own - you have to see Part One.  Also, even better, read the book of the same title first, so you can fill in the blanks.Unlike Part One, I saw no discernible blanks for Part Two (in a mental book comparison).  The film was all about Harry and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (aka ""You Know Who"").  Not a lot of character development in this last film, since you should know who they all are by now!Harry is much rougher and grittier in this version.  The laughing, smiling children from Year One are not there now.  If anything they're in a struggle for their lives with You Know Who, Death Eaters and Dementors flying about.  The action scenes with the giants, the spiders and chunks of castle blowing out into the sky was horrific.The dead bodies and blood, the horror of the battlefield, make for some pretty grim yet realistic battle scenes lifted from the Rowling novel.There are humorous scenes as well - watch for Ron and Hermione's kiss right after they accomplish one of their Horcrux missions.  I really wanted to see more scenes with Harry and Ginny but it was not meant to be.  Neville Longbottom's scenes were scene-stealers.  The actor really captured the essence of this character.Memorable scene:  You Know Who's confrontation with Harry;  the duplication of the scene with Bellatrix (""not my daughter you b*tch!) was amazing.Bottom Line:  Great tribute to the last book.  They could have really screwed this one up!  It's not perfect, but I give it five big stars for its spirit, not dwelling too much on any one scene or situation,  great pacing and dialogue.

when the preceding movie is better than the ending of the series,but this is what is happening here with Deathly Hollows part 2.I must say that this was made so much more apparent as we went to Cinemark Theater in Somerdale N.J.where we had the chance to watch both Part 1 and part 2 back to back in one showing on July 14th.First of all you have so many whys in this film,like why when the writer apparently wanted to vindicate Draco do you let Nevil Longbottom kill Nigani the snake rather than panning up from the legs and let Draco do it to vinicate his evil ways all through the film series.Also Dracos two buddies Crab and Goyle have been there through the whole film series but yet one is missing in this film and no one has said a word as to why hes not there, Dead,left the series,did not want to do it,at least something to tell us where hes at.Then we have professor Snape killed by Voltemolt who tells nigani the snake to finish him,the snake in every other film has eaten its victims but he does not eat Snape,why.This is the last in this fabulous seres and you would expect tremendous magicical super FX effects but there was more power between Voltemolt and Dumbeldor in the next to last film.The producers had a chance to really show some super fire power like between Snape and McGonagle in the first 20 minutes but its snap ,snap and thats it.The duels between Potter and Voltemolt should have been a drawn out explosion of epic proportions but you see more fire power in the new Smurfs movie, maybe we should have had Gargamal in this instead of Voltemolt doing the fight scenes with Potter.Then we have the last scene 19 years later where they claim all these characters have children but yet the only one that looks any older is Draco.Where was JK Rowling that she would let this series be filmed like this with so many open ended questions.For all the hype that this movie would be the crowning achievement of the series and the most spectacular special effects I think The Deathly Hollows Part 2 comes up way short and I hope when the dvd is released there certainly is a lot of deleated scenes and an alternate ending because this was a really sad ending to a series that was hyped and hyped and hyped..The only high point in this film is we get to see professor sprout,maybe they should have let professor Sprout milk the mandrake plants for a solution that could bring this film back from being petrified....Such a sad final tribute to this series I loved so much..Shame on you JK Rowling and Warner brothers Films.",3,Not The

Previously my favorite had been 'Goblet of Fire' for its dark, almost medieval tone and mature handling of grief (as well as its still unrivaled musical score). 'The Deathly Hallows, Part 2' has taken just about everything that was good about all the movies that came before to their highest level - special effects, action sequences, cinematography, acting (I'm looking at you, Hermione), and above all the sense of gravity necessary to allow the full weight of the meaning of this final showdown to project from the big screen.There were many scenes that were extremely well done. Fred disarmed and backed against the wall in slow motion; Ron holding Hermione just after Neville got to Nagini; Snape in tears with Dumbledore after Lily's death; and of course I could go on. It's as if the series finally, truly, solidly has grown up - it's too bad this is the end. (Of course, I always say it if got any darker it'd be classified as a turgid Russian crime drama, so maybe it's for the best)As always, there was some detracting from the events of the book - not very much, to my delight, especially since they had a whole movie to deal with the last third of a book - but the one major misstep is a huge one for me. The final showdown itself is not in front of a single soul. Which I could live with, if not for the fact that once Voldemort is disposed of - the very thing the entire wizarding world save for the Death Eaters had been wanting for years now - no one says A WORD about it. No cheers. No 'good job, Harry! Thanks!' Nothing. Not even from Ron or Hermione! This is utterly baffling to me. Utterly.It would have been perfect to show a few heartfelt congratulations toward Harry, and then perhaps some brief scenes around the wizarding world; people receiving the news via magical communication and reacting tearfully; with hugs; with celebration; with heaviness for those that were lost. These witches and wizards basically escaped a Nazi regime by a hair's breadth - there'd be a little jubilation, I'm sure of that. So, yeah. I'm utterly baffled.But there's nothing I can do about that, so I just have to be content with an overall fantastic movie that, honestly, should be nominated for an Oscar since they've begun over-nominating with TEN films in the category anymore.

Harry fortunately has many people on his side to help him in the battles with Lord Voldemort.  Lord Voldemort and his entourage try to isolate Harry, but it ends up only helping because of the fact that the movie deals with others joining Harry in the quest for a more peaceful environment.  Emma Watson and Rupert Grint continue to effectively play his two best friends (Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley) that are there to help Harry prevail in restoring harmony to the Hogwarts School.  Many of the actors gave a good performance, but my husband's personal favorite actress was Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange (one of Lord Voldemort's trusted servants).  This is because my husband felt that Helena's character of Bellatrix  gave a great performance as an evil and powerful witch with magical powers that kept Harry Potter on his toes with daring supernatural battles.  I can understand where my husband is coming from regarding Helena's superb acting. However, my personal favorite character of this movie was that of Severus Snape (played by Alan Rickman).

1241649,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B001UV4XIS,Steve,"[2, 22]","Many have credited J.K. Rowling with reintroducing generations to reading, her clever blend of myths, the supernatural, religious beliefs, and genres, and her remarkable rags to riches story while maintaining her charm and integrity. On the other hand, I also fault her with reviving serials; endless stories about the same characters and making this element an almost crucial requirement of teen literature. There is no Twilight without Harry Potter.One thing she did pull off, however, is a maturity and growth in her writing as the series progressed. She took one fully realized story and split it into seven increasingly darker (and longer) novels. While I grew tired of the story by the sixth installment and never bothered to read the finale (although I did skim the end just to see who dies), I admire the scope of her vision.Sadly, the final movie is crushed by the expectations and hype it has generated. The sub-culture of Rowling's amazing creation grew bigger than the story itself. The supremely convoluted plot, crumbling under the sheer number of subplots and frayed strands of characters complete with their own back stories, could not fit easily into a movie, even one that was made into two parts.I'll admit this; the final movie is everything its predecessor wasn't - fast-paced, action-packed, and entertaining. In all eight of the movies, there was only one where I left the theater in stunned amazement at how boring it was, and that was Part 1 of this two-part finale. In the end, however, I felt no dramatic tension and nothing happened that truly surprised me. In fact, some of the revelations/closures felt cheap and almost laughable. Speaking of, more unfortunately absent is a sense of humor.In trying to squeeze too much into one film, there proved little room for anything else but a never-ending stream of perplexing explanations, final battles, and hurriedly cauterized plot threads. Everything was life and death serious at the expense of the charm of the first four installments; i.e., the ability to laugh at itself and the knowing wink that we're all part of the fun. The movie theater was funeral silent throughout and it was all my kids and I could do to stifle the need to snicker and chuckle at how ludicrous it all was. Within the first ten minutes or so I almost burst into laughter at the comically serious conversation between Harry and an elf. Has Rowling (with help from George Lucas and CGI) resurrected our culture's obsession with fantasy to the point where I'm supposed to not be amused by the sheer lunacy of it? Am I to accept equally World of Warcraft with The Godfather?The emotional urgency of the Potter faithful (one word: Trekkie) has become larger than the books or movies. Articles have been written about how the finale is a bittersweet cultural event and that we are all part of the public eulogy for the Potter franchise. Lost in the insane media hype assault and the sheeple consumption of all things Harry Potter is the blunt reality that we are talking about seven books that are at times fun to read but can also get incredibly tedious, which thus spawned seven movies that are generally entertaining but certainly not life-changing. It's a lightweight legend combined with the pain and angst of a teen's diary. In ten years or so, I would hope our society will look back at the past decade and feel pangs of embarrassment at how silly and inconsequential it all seems in hindsight.",3,Harry Potter and the Suffocating Cultural Phenomenon,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,3449,"['Many', 'have', 'credited', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'reintroducing', 'generations', 'reading', 'clever', 'blend', 'myths', 'supernatural', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'genres', 'remarkable', 'rags', 'riches', 'story', 'maintaining', 'charm', 'integrity', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'fault', 'reviving', 'serials', 'stories', 'same', 'characters', 'making', 'element', 'almost', 'crucial', 'requirement', 'teen', 'literature', 'Twilight', 'Harry', 'Potter.One', 'thing', 'did', 'pull', 'off', 'however', 'maturity', 'growth', 'writing', 'series', 'progressed', 'took', 'one', 'fully', 'realized', 'story', 'split', 'seven', 'increasingly', 'darker', 'longer', 'novels', 'grew', 'tired', 'story', 'sixth', 'installment', 'never', 'bothered', 'read', 'finale', 'did', 'skim', 'end', 'just', 'see', 'who', 'admire', 'scope', 'vision.Sadly', 'final', 'movie', 'crushed', 'expectations', 'hype', 'generated', 'sub-culture', 'Rowling', 'amazing', 'creation', 'grew', 'bigger', 'story', 'supremely', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'crumbling', 'sheer', 'number', 'subplots', 'frayed', 'strands', 'characters', 'complete', 'own', 'back', 'stories', 'could', 'not', 'fit', 'easily', 'movie', 'even', 'one', 'was', 'made', 'two', 'parts.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'final', 'movie', 'everything', 'predecessor', 'was', ""n't"", 'fast-paced', 'action-packed', 'entertaining', 'eight', 'movies', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'where', 'left', 'theater', 'stunned', 'amazement', 'how', 'boring', 'was', 'was', 'Part', '1', 'two-part', 'finale', 'end', 'however', 'felt', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'nothing', 'happened', 'truly', 'surprised', 'fact', 'revelations/closures', 'felt', 'cheap', 'almost', 'laughable', 'Speaking', 'more', 'unfortunately', 'absent', 'sense', 'humor.In', 'trying', 'squeeze', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'proved', 'little', 'room', 'anything', 'else', 'never-ending', 'stream', 'perplexing', 'explanations', 'final', 'battles', 'hurriedly', 'cauterized', 'plot', 'threads', 'Everything', 'was', 'life', 'death', 'serious', 'expense', 'charm', 'first', 'four', 'installments', 'i.e.', 'ability', 'laugh', 'knowing', 'wink', ""'re"", 'part', 'fun', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'funeral', 'silent', 'was', 'kids', 'could', 'do', 'stifle', 'need', 'snicker', 'chuckle', 'how', 'ludicrous', 'was', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'almost', 'burst', 'laughter', 'comically', 'serious', 'conversation', 'Harry', 'elf', 'Has', 'Rowling', 'help', 'George', 'Lucas', 'CGI', 'resurrected', 'culture', 'obsession', 'fantasy', 'point', 'where', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'not', 'be', 'amused', 'sheer', 'lunacy', 'Am', 'accept', 'equally', 'World', 'Warcraft', 'Godfather', 'emotional', 'urgency', 'Potter', 'faithful', 'one', 'word', 'Trekkie', 'become', 'larger', 'books', 'movies', 'Articles', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'how', 'finale', 'bittersweet', 'cultural', 'event', 'are', 'part', 'public', 'eulogy', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'Lost', 'insane', 'media', 'hype', 'assault', 'sheeple', 'consumption', 'things', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'blunt', 'reality', 'are', 'talking', 'seven', 'books', 'are', 'times', 'fun', 'read', 'can', 'also', 'get', 'incredibly', 'tedious', 'thus', 'spawned', 'seven', 'movies', 'are', 'generally', 'entertaining', 'certainly', 'not', 'life-changing', 'lightweight', 'legend', 'combined', 'pain', 'angst', 'teen', 'diary', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'would', 'hope', 'society', 'will', 'look', 'back', 'past', 'decade', 'feel', 'pangs', 'embarrassment', 'how', 'silly', 'inconsequential', 'hindsight']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

1241652,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B001UV4XIS,Steven Aldersley,"[4, 5]","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2Directed by David YatesStarring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman and Maggie SmithWarner Bros. | 2011 | 130 min | Rated PG-13 | Released Jul 15, 2011 (Theaters)The Film 4.5/5I'm a fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I have read all of the books and own the first seven movies. My favorite in the series is the Prisoner of Azkaban, while I rate Deathly Hallows Part 1 as the weakest entry.It seems that Part 1 moves slowly and contains too many insignificant scenes. In contrast, this final installment feels a little rushed. It runs about two hours before the credits start to roll and tries to cram in the final showdown, while tying up as many loose ends as possible. Some of the threads are resolved using rather clumsy exposition and deserved more screen time. My final quibble involves the use of quick cuts to increase the sense of action. The story was good enough to do that on its own and I didn't feel that it was necessary to turn some of the scenes into something resembling Bourne.Although the movie isn't perfect, it's still a fine way to end a thoroughly enjoyable franchise.I can't imagine that this final entry will be seen by many people who avoided the first seven movies, and that's a good thing. The story picks up right where Part 1 ended and introduces us to many of the characters from the first seven movies. It wouldn't have much impact as a standalone movie and it's not supposed to. I'm interested in seeing the two final parts together to see whether Part 1 works better. In fact, I'll watch all eight movies when the final Blu-ray is released.The story follows Harry, Ron and Hermione in their search for the remaining horcruxes. The first hunt is a spectacular affair which is heavy on the special effects and action. I'm aware that many viewers will not have read the books, so I'm not going to spoil anything. If you read the final book, you'll be aware of which sequence I'm referring to.For anyone who complained about the absence of scenes involving Hogwarts in Part 1, much of the action takes place at the school in this concluding part. What struck me is how different Hogwarts looked when we were first introduced to the world of Harry Potter. Gone are the vibrant colors and whimsical interactions with ghosts or paintings. Instead, be prepared to enter a dark setting. I mean that literally as the setting is extremely dim for about 95 percent of the movie; think Gotham City for a comparison.Another thing that I noticed is how much the acting has improved. The main characters were around 11 years old when the franchise was born, so they are about 21 now. Radcliffe held his own in scenes involving some of the best British character actors of their generation. Watson and Grint played their parts well, and it's a tribute to the original casting that the franchise has developed as well as it has.It should be noted how important some of the supporting actors are to the success of the franchise. Can you imagine anyone other than Alan Rickman as Snape? His story is one of the most interesting in the series and sees a fitting conclusion. I'm also fond of Maggie Smith's portrayal of McGonagall and love her role in the final installment. You'll see actors that have appeared infrequently given a little recognition, and they deserve it.I watched the movie with a large audience made up of children and adults into their sixties. Although the sense of evil was always present and the setting was dark, the audience found plenty of scenes worthy of laughter. It's a truly entertaining movie.The movie might have improved if 30 minutes were added so that everything felt less rushed, but it could have affected the tension if we were given more chances to breathe. The sense of scale reminded me of some of the battles seen in Lord of the Rings. Replace Voldemort's minions with orcs, and there were quite a few similarities.Fans of the Harry Potter franchise, and I am among them, will be pleased with the way everything is wrapped up. After a disappointment in Part 1, the conclusion was worthy of the story created in the first seven movies. To see who lives, who dies, and what happens to the survivors, you'll have to check it out for yourself. I thoroughly recommend the experience.The Blu-ray release should be spectacular, despite the grim setting. The explosions and battle scenes will rock your home theater.",5,A fitting conclusion to an enjoyable franchise,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,4445,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '2Directed', 'David', 'YatesStarring', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Maggie', 'SmithWarner', 'Bros.', '|', '2011', '|', '130', 'min', '|', 'Rated', 'PG-13', '|', 'Released', 'Jul', '15', '2011', 'Theaters', 'Film', '4.5/5I', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'own', 'first', 'seven', 'movies', 'favorite', 'series', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'rate', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '1', 'weakest', 'entry.It', 'Part', '1', 'moves', 'slowly', 'too', 'many', 'insignificant', 'scenes', 'contrast', 'final', 'installment', 'little', 'rushed', 'two', 'hours', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', 'tries', 'cram', 'final', 'showdown', 'tying', 'up', 'as', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'possible', 'threads', 'are', 'resolved', 'using', 'rather', 'clumsy', 'exposition', 'deserved', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'final', 'quibble', 'use', 'quick', 'cuts', 'increase', 'sense', 'action', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'do', 'own', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'necessary', 'turn', 'scenes', 'something', 'resembling', 'movie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'still', 'fine', 'way', 'end', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'franchise.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'final', 'entry', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'avoided', 'first', 'seven', 'movies', 'good', 'thing', 'story', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'Part', '1', 'ended', 'introduces', 'many', 'characters', 'first', 'seven', 'movies', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'impact', 'standalone', 'movie', 'not', 'supposed', ""'m"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'two', 'final', 'parts', 'together', 'see', 'Part', '1', 'better', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'eight', 'movies', 'when', 'final', 'Blu-ray', 'released.The', 'story', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'search', 'remaining', 'horcruxes', 'first', 'hunt', 'spectacular', 'affair', 'heavy', 'special', 'effects', 'action', ""'m"", 'aware', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'books', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'anything', 'read', 'final', 'book', ""'ll"", 'be', 'aware', 'sequence', ""'m"", 'referring', 'to.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'complained', 'absence', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Hogwarts', 'Part', '1', 'much', 'action', 'place', 'school', 'concluding', 'part', 'What', 'struck', 'how', 'different', 'Hogwarts', 'looked', 'when', 'were', 'first', 'introduced', 'world', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Gone', 'are', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'whimsical', 'interactions', 'ghosts', 'paintings', 'Instead', 'be', 'prepared', 'enter', 'dark', 'setting', 'mean', 'literally', 'setting', 'extremely', 'dim', '95', 'percent', 'movie', 'think', 'Gotham', 'City', 'comparison.Another', 'thing', 'noticed', 'how', 'much', 'acting', 'improved', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'around', '11', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'franchise', 'was', 'born', 'are', '21', 'now', 'Radcliffe', 'held', 'own', 'scenes', 'involving', 'best', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'generation', 'Watson', 'Grint', 'played', 'parts', 'well', 'tribute', 'original', 'casting', 'franchise', 'developed', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'how', 'important', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'success', 'franchise', 'Can', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'other', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'series', 'fitting', 'conclusion', ""'m"", 'also', 'fond', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'portrayal', 'McGonagall', 'love', 'role', 'final', 'installment', ""'ll"", 'see', 'actors', 'have', 'appeared', 'infrequently', 'given', 'little', 'recognition', 'deserve', 'it.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'large', 'audience', 'made', 'children', 'adults', 'sixties', 'sense', 'evil', 'was', 'always', 'present', 'setting', 'was', 'dark', 'audience', 'found', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'worthy', 'laughter', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'improved', '30', 'minutes', 'were', 'added', 'so', 'everything', 'felt', 'less', 'rushed', 'could', 'have', 'affected', 'tension', 'were', 'given', 'more', 'chances', 'breathe', 'sense', 'scale', 'reminded', 'battles', 'seen', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Replace', 'Voldemort', 'minions', 'orcs', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'similarities.Fans', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'am', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'way', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'disappointment', 'Part', '1', 'conclusion', 'was', 'worthy', 'story', 'created', 'first', 'seven', 'movies', 'see', 'who', 'who', 'what', 'survivors', ""'ll"", 'have', 'check', 'out', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', 'experience.The', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'should', 'be', 'spectacular', 'grim', 'setting', 'explosions', 'battle', 'scenes', 'will', 'rock', 'home', 'theater']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"

That said, I decided to give this movie 3 stars based on an overall review of the movie. This is coming from someone that is a diehard Harry Potter fan, has the HB & PB of all seven books, all the movies and numerous other HP books. I stand by my overall praising of the whole of the HP world. And this movie is no different, I have seen far worse movies. In my opinion, the only thing that saved this movie from earning a one-star review, were the spectacular special effects and the absolutely amazing acting chops of certain actors. You know those types of actors. The ones who are the only thing saving a movie from being a complete bomb and bloody horror. Those types of actors being: Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis and so on. The special effects were exactly what one would expect in a movie of this magnitude. And taking into account even though the last book WAS split into two seperate movies, massive ammounts of the book could not be included in the movie based on the obvious time issue. But what was included was either done very poorly or was raped and changed so drastically it barely resembled the original. For example: Snape's death and Harry's viewing of Snape's memories in the pensieve in Dumbledore's office.

With the magnificent twist in the tale at the end. AND IT WASN'T THERE!!! AAAAAAGHHHH!! We get some hamfisted travesty of an ending that's about as far as one can get from the book. Instead of ending with a bang, it ends with a CGI-enhanced whimper. The climax to the whole series and the film makers bottle it completely. How could they have done this? How could Ms. Rowling have let them? This film needs a remake.Now it is acknowledged that it's simply not possible to put the whole complexity of Rowling's world into a film for Muggle audiences, and that leaving some bits out is inevitable and will upset someone or other. However, none of the other books have been subjected to the wholesale butchery of this one. It's truncated, brutally hacked about and has a total travesty of an ending. If you enjoy the book, wait for the remake. You'll wait forever, do you say? That's not such a bad thing.I give it two stars for the few good bits that are there, and for the whole marvellous Rowling concept. It deserved better than this.

There were a lot of important sequences from the book that had to be filmed just right to be able to pull off the emotional and dramatic impact - and the movie succeeded in all regards (Snape's memories, Harry using the resurrection stone and sacrificing himself to Voldemort, and the reactions of those that loved Harry seeing his ""dead"" body).  In previous movies, director David Yates has had a somewhat bad habit of deleting important parts from the books and adding parts that were not in the book (see Half Blood Prince for the best examples of this).  In this particular movie, Yates' adding, expanding, and showing things not necessarily shown in the book worked very well:  Hogwarts virtually turned into a prison camp with the teachers leading students in formation to their destination, Harry confronting Snape directly about his murder of Dumbledore, showing Ron and Hermione actually going into the Chamber of Secrets, and the much-expanded final battle between Harry and Voldemort.  Curiously missing was the explanation why Harry was able to return to life (Voldemort had used Harry's blood in his resurrection in Goblet of Fire which linked Harry to the Earth similar to Voldemort's own Horcruxes);  by sacrificing himself, Harry had become the ""master of death"" and the dementors could not affect him and all the people he cared about now had the same type of protection around them that his mother had put on him, and finally Harry not repairing his original wand with the Elder Wand...with all the talk of wand lore, this was very important to Harry to have his old wand back and was basically his final act before the epilogue.  The movies like to show the wands spells connecting, which really only happened once in GoF because Harry and Voldemort's wands had twin cores), but it's a good visual effect, along with smoke trails of the Death Eaters when they actually just appear or disappear when they apparate/disapparate.  With that being said, Deathly Hallows part 2 is a fantastic movie and is action packed, visually stunning, emotional, funny at the right times, and dramatic.

1241680,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B001UV4XIS,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","Perhaps this is the best place to review the series as well as the last installment. We have seen Daniel Radcliffe mature from a fairy bad actor to one that is fairly convincing, particularly in his standing up to Aberforth Dumbledore. Emma Watson has gone from awkward kid who wore her emotions on her sleeve to Maxim's top 100 Hottest women. The passing of Richard Harris was a major let down to the series as Michael Gambon couldn't really fill his shoes. The most interesting and complex character was that of Snape. Alan Rickman made the series with his portrayal. The casting of the quirky minor characters made the story most enjoyable, all the way down to Mrs. Fink. Rowling's use of classical mythology, astronomy and the occult made the series an incredible educational experience. One of my favorite characters was the under used Luna Lovegood. She was a breath of fresh air.The direction of Chris Columbus was by far the best as well as the screen adaptations, which more closely followed the books. Starting with the third installment, the audience got short changed (There, I said it) especially those who didn't read the books...such as myself. This wasn't a bad thing as it led to a bonding with my niece who did read the books and I would take her to the films so she could explain them to me. Like Hermione, she is one of those ""insufferable know-it-alls"" who loves to let you know what she knows. (Good luck with that brain surgeon thing.)In this final episode, the gang of 3 go after the remaining Horcrux(s) which are now easier to locate than in the last 2 films. This one follows the later films in that it lacks the humor of the earlier ones.The movie, like the series drives home the ideas of teamwork, friendship, and courage. Goblins, spiders, troll, elves, death eaters, a dragon, and of course he who we do not speak. Personally, I would have done the ending differently, especially with Snape and Malfoy.

1241686,AMF52GSX309V0,B001UV4XIS,Tony S.,"[1, 1]","I'm one of those late arrivals to the Harry Potter world.  I never read any of J.K.Rowling books about the boy who lived.  I didn't know anything about the wizarding world, or witches, or where Hogwarts was.  I saw the first three films in the theaters, but skipped the rest.  Now?  Now, I love everything about the movies.  A few months ago when Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1 was released on DVD; I started a Harry Potter marathon from the beginning.  I watched them all in order.  Since then, I've watched all the DVDs, four times.  That's 28 viewings of Harry Potter films all leading up to this.  The epic conclusion to the most successful (critical and commercial) series in cinema history.  Let me begin.What I liked about the movie:The StoryIf this isn't obvious, I don't know what is.  An orphan wizard, magic spells, and an unknown connection to an evil wizard named Volemort.  The movie is easy to follow as a lot of the set up was done in earlier movies.  This is a balls to the wall action epic.  The final battle between Harry and the wizards against Voldemort and his army.  You really must see the previous films to fully appreciate the conclusions in this film.  The one thing that is important above all else... above all the explosions and magic and spells is simple... friendship.  The story of three best friends and their journey to this epic conclusion is unmatched by any other film I've ever seen.  THAT'S ultimately why these movies are so satisfying to so many people.  I don't want to say too much more, if you were looking for a plot summary, this review is not the place.Characters / ActorsAs with any great story, there must be great characters. And for 10+ years, the world enjoyed these characters.  Rowling has given the world so much.  And what this film has been able to do is showcase them all.I believe the supporting cast must be recognized.  The marvelous Ralph Fiennes as the evil Lord Voldemort.  Alan Rickman as the mysterious Snape.  Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange.  Jason Isaacs and Tom Felton as Lucious and Draco Malfoy.  Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom.  And the lovely Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall.  There are many more.  Maybe they weren't showcased for long periods of time, but every hero, every villain and every wizard in between is included in the story.Then there are the three main characters, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson) who really shine.  Their character development is key to the success of the film.  They each go through a transition and grow as a character.  It's amazing to think the producers have been able to keep all the same actors in tact for this epic series of films.  The best scenes in the movie involve the three best friends.  Like I've been saying all week... Harry, Ron and Hermione... I'll miss you.The ScoreThe theme to Harry Potter was written back when the first film was released, by none other than John Williams.  The same brilliant man that brought us the scores to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Superman and so many more.  Alexandre Desplat scored HP and TDH Part 1, so it is fitting that he has returned to score the finale.  The score is beautiful.  I actually purchased it yesterday and I am listening to it as I type this review.The emotional weight of the score is vital to the story (you're going to read a lot about the emotional weight of the film in this review).  The music alone tells the story.  I was chatting with a friend about the film and told her I could discuss the score alone for hours.  And I really could.  The score was so impressive in relaying the emotion as well has elevating the action.  It was was enough to put me on the edge of my seat, literally.  And never forgetting the original theme created by Williams, it is weaved into this film as well.  Bravo Mr. Desplat.The Editing / Pacing / ToneThis is something that doesn't get a lot of recognition in Hollywood, but it is so important to a movie like this.  If the editing and pacing is off, the entire movie crumbles.  You know by now there is a lot of emotion and also action in the movie.  How do you work those two together?  The editing is key.  Mark Day did an amazing job of keeping the film nice and neat.  There is no deviating from the plan.  For the most part, the film is told in chronological order, and there was a lot to cover.  The tone was perfect as well.  And I believe it is the marriage of cinematography, editing and score that sets the tone.  Great all around!The DirectorReally, what the score, editing, pacing and tone all come down to is the work of David Yates.  Yates has directed the last four Harry Potter films in the series.  And there is a reason for that.  He understood the material, he understood the world.  The producers of the films understood Yates is a fantastic director.  His work on this film proves you could have a huge Summer blockbuster, and still carry the emotional weight of a drama.  It was perfectly balanced and Yates is the man to thank.What I didn't like about the movie:LengthIronically, this is the shortest film in series.  If only that wasn't the case.  I understood Warner Brothers' motivation for splitting the two films in half.  But in retrospect, I wouldn't have split the movies where Yates did.  I would have included some of Part 1 in Part 2.  Just my opinion.  Maybe it's because I didn't want it to be over I was enjoying it so much!The Verdict:Amazing, what all Summer movies should beWe've come to expect explosions and special effects in our Summer movies.  But what we are missing in most of those films is the emotional weight to make us care.  I know I keep repeating myself, but this movie made us care.  We felt invested in these characters and the final outcome of their stories.  This all goes back to Rowling and her writing.  Without her imagination, none of this comes true.  Brilliant, simply brilliant.While watching some of the special features, the producers refer to the films as a series, NOT a franchise. This is true; the movies are a series spanning 8 films to tell an overall story. It's not a franchise of unrelated events.  So to see the 8th and final film combine so much was amazing.  There are aspects and remnants of all the prior movies in this film.It was difficult to say goodbye to all the amazing characters, but the beauty of cinema is this... great stories and great films stay with us, forever.  Whether it's E.T. and Elliot's remarkable friendship, or Harry, Ron and Hermione causing trouble... we're reminded, through film, of what it was like to be a kid again.  I sat next to a little boy at a sold out screening and was mesmerized by his reaction to the film.  He laughed, he cried and he covered his eyes at times.  But he was so engaged in the film, it was an awesome sight.  Movies like Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 give me hope for the future of cinema.",5,Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 review,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,6930,"[""'m"", 'one',

1241687,A2TON0Y454P0NG,B001UV4XIS,"Took &amp; Baggins ""Bill""","[1, 2]","I liked seeing the final chapter in the Harry Potter saga. It was, I believe, the darkest movie of the bunch, even darker than ""Prisoner of Azkaban"".I know, I know, it's supposed to be good versus evil, but how convincing would someone who is evil be if it was always dark around them? Might that be a tip off? No, in my experience, evil usually presents itself in a more comely manner.I thought the movie suffered from what ailed almost all of the later movies, the movies based on big books, in that you really had to have read the book in order to understand (at least part of) the movie. These movies don't stand on their own; they are like in jokes that you must know a certain something in order to get.These movies also suffered from taking too long to make, and the characters aged far too much for the supposed time spent. It's too bad that the films couldn't have been made much closer together, even if they were released later. The three main characters looked a lot better in the first movies than in the end.Speaking of the end, I thought this movie's end was a let down, a petering out rather than a finish. The movie seemed to be going through the motions, the obligatory motions at that.Yes, I have criticisms of this movie, but I'm pleased it finally came out. Nevertheless, it would be nice if there were more movies like the first two Harry Potter movies, with more awe and wonder. Kids grow up and many become troubled and sullen, shy, self-conflicted, and unsure, but I an not certain that makes for good movies.Of the three main characters, in the movies, only Hermione (Emma Watson) did a credible job throughout.

The battle scenes have become more spectacular and powerful with fantastic use of special effects and effective editing.Watching ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is like attending a school reunion.

What started as an incredible drama ends in a fast paced battle between good and evil in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts. Still, in all the explosions and special effects the film is filled with emotion in two ways. The final film ties together the whole story, including some major revelations in Harrys' world and certain characters. Of course the main event in this film is the final showdown between himself and the one who wanted him dead ever since he was a child.Personally I felt that there was just a little bit missing from this film, but as a whole especially seeing it along with `The Deathly Hallows Part 1' it does a great job giving the fans the ending they have been expecting to see. As a whole I am happy to say that while these films may not have been as great as the books themselves, they were by no means horrible films.

Not perfect, like book-perfect, for no matter how hard you try, you just can't recreate the true awesomeness of the books. But just truly a great end to the Harry Potter film franchise. I could nitpick certain details, being the addict that I am, but I'm not going to because as a whole, it just works from beginning to end.Starting out a tad on the slow side, DH pt 2 very quickly escalates to non-stop action that doesn't cease until the near end. It will keep you glued to the screen, on the edge of your seat. There's so much to look at but you never really lose focus. The CGI is utterly fantastic, probably the best looking film since Prisoner of Azkaban. Then there's the beautifully moody score by my new favorite composer (since Benjamin Button) Alexandre Desplat.  You are always aware of it, but it is never distracting, and always moving.The actors do such a fantastic job with their parts, and I'm not just talking about the three main ones. Radcliffe exceeded all my expectations and then some, and his two faithful companions were no different. You will see little cameos during the film, including Emma Thompson as Trelawney, who has maybe 1 line, but she made me smile nonetheless. Dame Maggie Smith delivers a stirring and surprisingly robust performance and delivers a line that had the entire theater roaring with laughter. Ralph Feinnes is even more sinister and frightening, never failing in his task to truly impress. Finally, I've saved the best for last. The absolute perfection that is Alan Rickman, as the always mysterious, never boring, Professor Severus Snape. The most brilliant casting in the entire series. He will break your heart a thousand times over, even for people who have read the books a million times. Finally, FINALLY we get to see him in all his glory. It's just a shame we had to wait 8 films to see it, but oh what a performance! Truly award-worthy.I was a bit concerned for the epilogue but was extremely surprised and pleased by the way it came out. Very realisticly done. Subtle, and just right.

Could not have been further from the truth. Great ending & some nice twists and turns between. A movie in my opinion well worth owning on it's own merits.If you watch ""DH1&2"" back to back...this gives the viewer a better idea of what I think the screen writers are trying to convey and absolutely gives the movie more of an even flow from beginning to end.

Rowling.  There is little for me to criticize here except for one thing:  something about the ending felt somehow very disengaged and somewhat unsatisfying.  I am not quite smart enough to put my finger on exactly what that missing thing was, but I felt it.  The ending seemed almost trite and devoid of the energy of the rest of the movies.  I know it was authentic to the way that books ended, but as a movie, it seemed to need something else to bring it all to a satisfying conclusion.  Yes, I know, it all concluded the way that the book did and the outcomes were the same.  It was just the manner in which things were presented ON FILM that left me somewhat let down.  Still, given that as my only criticism, the final movie in this franchise, was yet another piece of amazing film-making.  Again, the actors were all superb.  The set pieces were absolutely done with love and care and authenticity and lavish devotion to the Rowling books.I've mentioned in a previous review of Part 1 that the 3D version of Hallows was way too dark to be enjoyable and that the 2D version was much better.  The same holds true for Part 2 as well.  For some reason, both 3D versions that I purchased from Amazon were way too dark and were not nearly as enjoyable of their 2D Blueray versions.  I have not taken a star away from the movie for this reason, however, but rather for the somewhat disappointing way which the final film was concluded; it just didn't seem quite right.

In this film, director David Yates manages to translate all of those same emotions to the big screen to really re-create the magic of Rowling's pen into visual form.For a basic plot summary, ""Deathly Hallows 2"" produces the endgame of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) plan to rule the wizarding world.  While Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) close in on the last Horcruxes, the students and teachers of Hogwarts must defend their territory in the face of constant Death Eater assault.  As the final battle for the school rages, Harry (as is his destiny, made even clearer by a pensieve trip into the memories of Severus Snape (Alan Rickman)), must face Voldemort alone to decide their fate.Like ""Deathly Hallows 1"", this movie is allowed enough time to focus on the details of the story without it feeling rushed or excising parts altogether.  In Rowling's ""Potter Endgame"", pretty much every page has some sort of meaning, and this film is able to explore those events/emotions with the care they deserve.It also helps that ""DH 2"" showcases some of the best acting of the entire series.  The lead trio have perfected their roles by this point, and the auxiliary cast is now so large and deep that every interaction seems like a true happening.Overall, this big-screen finale to the Harry Potter franchise is exactly what you would want in a based-on-the-novel scenario: it stays true to the source material while at the same time translating it into visual drama instead of imagined or ""thought"" drama.",5,A Spectacular Rendering Of The Source Material,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,1664,"['ending', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'novel', 'wonderful', 'way', 'bring', 'close', 'such', 'epic', 'series', 'order', 'film', 'director', 'David', 'manages', 'translate', 'same', 'emotions', 'big', 'screen', 'really', 're-create', 'magic', 'Rowling', 'pen', 'visual', 'form.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Deathly', '2', 'endgame', 'Voldemort', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'plan', 'rule', 'wizarding', 'world', 'Harry', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermoine', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'close', 'last', 'Horcruxes', 'students', 'teachers', 'Hogwarts', 'must', 'defend', 'territory', 'face', 'constant', 'Death', 'Eater', 'assault', 'final', 'battle', 'school', 'rages', 'Harry', 'destiny', 'made', 'even', 'clearer', 'pensieve', 'trip', 'memories', 'Severus', 'Snape', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'must', 'face', 'Voldemort', 'alone', 'decide', 'fate.Like', 'Deathly', '1', 'movie', 'allowed', 'enough', 'time', 'focus', 'details', 'story', 'feeling', 'rushed', 'excising', 'parts', 'altogether', 'Rowling', 'Potter', 'Endgame', 'pretty', 'much', 'page', 'sort', 'meaning', 'film', 'able', 'explore', 'events/emotions', 'care', 'deserve.It', 'also', 'DH', '2', 'best', 'acting', 'entire', 'series', 'lead', 'trio', 'have', 'perfected', 'roles', 'point', 'auxiliary', 'cast', 'now', 'so', 'large', 'deep', 'interaction', 'true', 'happening.Overall', 'big-screen', 'finale', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'want', 'based-on-the-novel', 'scenario', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'same', 'time', 'translating', 'visual', 'drama', 'instead', 'imagined', 'thought', 'drama']","HP7: Deathly Hallows, P2 (DVD)"
