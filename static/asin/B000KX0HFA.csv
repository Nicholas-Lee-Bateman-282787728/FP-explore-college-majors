1035927,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000KX0HFA,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","First of all, let me mention an EXTREMELY important note.  If you're a mother expecting a baby, or a mother who's already had a baby, DO NOT WATCH FIRST BORN!!!!!Seriously, I'm a guy and this movie had MY emotional state of mind up in a frenzy.  I can only imagine such a cruel and twisted storyline would have an even bigger impact on a mother.It's about a mother who does nothing but walks around the house all day having hallucinations and anxiety attacks (usually in the darkest areas of the house, perhaps in an attempt to make the suspense factor more believable).  She strongly believes something terrible is going to happen to either her baby or herself.  To name one example, she believes the babysitter is trying to kill her baby with a knife.  There's several more examples I could name but I don't want to ruin all the surprises.It even gets to the point that the police have to come out and check on her because of the many outrageous claims she makes.  It might be simple to believe she's just an overprotective mother and in a few segments, the storyline sure seems to lead one to believe this is the case, however the more the storyline unfolds the more you start believing there's actually something seriously and emotionally wrong with the mother.Another aspect that seems to go by without notice is that, since the mother spends so much time alone with her baby, that would eventually make *anyone* a little secluded, nervous and jumpy.  However it's clear this is just a tiny aspect to a much bigger problem concerning this woman.Now I don't know about anyone else, but I was constantly wondering why the father could never be home with the baby despite knowing full well that his wife is not going through the best of times to say the least.  I even remember a segment where the wife/mother even SAYS that her husband is planning to take some time off from work to take care of the baby.  However it never happens.One thing I never quite understood is the mother's relationship with the cashier lady at the downtown supermarket.  Supposedly the mother moved into a house where the previous owner left a diary that she wanted to return, and the cashier lady knew this girl (they were friends) but nothing noteworthy ever came out of these segments.  We never met the girl, or why she left (though I suppose it's up to interpretation how or why the girl left that house- the look on the face of the cashier lady seems to indicate she didn't leave under the most pleasant of circumstances).So what might lead viewers into thinking we're dealing with a storyline concerning an overprotective or unfit mother soon tells a much different and ultimately *very* disturbing plotline.  Again, it needs to be mentioned that no mother with a newborn baby should EVER -under any circumstances- watch First Born.  You might find yourself in the same kind of situation (though hopefully significantly less drastic than what this actress portrays).",4,different type of suspense,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,2953,"['First', 'let', 'mention', 'EXTREMELY', 'important', 'note', ""'re"", 'mother', 'expecting', 'baby', 'mother', 'who', 'already', 'had', 'baby', 'DO', 'NOT', 'WATCH', 'FIRST', 'BORN', 'Seriously', ""'m"", 'guy', 'movie', 'had', 'MY', 'emotional', 'state', 'mind', 'up', 'frenzy', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'cruel', 'twisted', 'storyline', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'bigger', 'impact', 'mother.It', 'mother', 'who', 'nothing', 'walks', 'house', 'day', 'having', 'hallucinations', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'usually', 'darkest', 'areas', 'house', 'perhaps', 'attempt', 'make', 'suspense', 'factor', 'more', 'believable', 'strongly', 'something', 'terrible', 'going', 'happen', 'baby', 'name', 'one', 'example', 'babysitter', 'trying', 'kill', 'baby', 'knife', 'several', 'more', 'examples', 'could', 'name', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'surprises.It', 'even', 'point', 'police', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'check', 'many', 'outrageous', 'claims', 'might', 'be', 'simple', 'believe', 'just', 'overprotective', 'mother', 'few', 'segments', 'storyline', 'sure', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'case', 'however', 'more', 'storyline', 'more', 'start', 'believing', 'actually', 'something', 'seriously', 'emotionally', 'wrong', 'mother.Another', 'aspect', 'go', 'notice', 'mother', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'alone', 'baby', 'would', 'eventually', 'make', '*anyone*', 'little', 'secluded', 'nervous', 'jumpy', 'However', 'clear', 'just', 'tiny', 'aspect', 'much', 'bigger', 'problem', 'concerning', 'woman.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'constantly', 'wondering', 'why', 'father', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'home', 'baby', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'wife', 'not', 'going', 'best', 'times', 'say', 'least', 'even', 'remember', 'segment', 'where', 'wife/mother', 'even', 'SAYS', 'husband', 'planning', 'take', 'time', 'off', 'work', 'take', 'care', 'baby', 'However', 'never', 'happens.One', 'thing', 'never', 'quite', 'understood', 'mother', 'relationship', 'cashier', 'lady', 'downtown', 'supermarket', 'Supposedly', 'mother', 'moved', 'house', 'where', 'previous', 'owner', 'left', 'diary', 'wanted', 'return', 'cashier', 'lady', 'knew', 'girl', 'were', 'friends', 'nothing', 'noteworthy', 'ever', 'came', 'segments', 'never', 'met', 'girl', 'why', 'left', 'suppose', 'up', 'interpretation', 'how', 'why', 'girl', 'left', 'house-', 'look', 'face', 'cashier', 'lady', 'indicate', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'most', 'pleasant', 'circumstances', '.So', 'what', 'might', 'lead', 'viewers', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'storyline', 'concerning', 'overprotective', 'unfit', 'mother', 'soon', 'much', 'different', 'ultimately', '*very*', 'disturbing', 'plotline', 'Again', 'be', 'mentioned', 'mother', 'newborn', 'baby', 'should', 'EVER', '-under', 'circumstances-', 'watch', 'First', 'Born', 'might', 'find', 'same', 'kind', 'situation', 'hopefully', 'significantly', 'less', 'drastic', 'what', 'actress']",First Born

Elisabeth Shue is wonderful as a woman who is thrust into the depths of insanity after having her first born child.Laura (Shue) and her husband Steven (Steven Mackintosh) seem to be the perfect couple. They are young, wealthy and stable. The only thing to complete their union is a baby and soon they get their wish.What's so different about this film is you can't pinpoint what causes the demise of Laura's sanity. You wanna say it's postpartum depression but Laura starts having visions and becoming paranoid even before the baby is born. Once Jessica comes into their lives Laura loses her battle with sanity and before long even the audience doesn't know if it's coming or going.This film is a perfect blend of suspense and thrills. It isn't an in-your-face horror but it still has those elements. There are a lot of unanswered questions but that is what makes the film so mysterious.Elisabeth Shue is a fine actress and it was refreshing to see her in a role apart from the goodie-two-shoes characters she usually plays. I felt that Mackintosh who is an actor I've enjoyed in many things was wasted. His only role was being the clueless husband and at times he was just a bit too clueless.It's been a long time since I've seen a thriller that makes you think and it was an entertaining experience.If you're a fan of Hitchcock-like films then you will definitely enjoy this one.",5,Best Thriller I've Seen in A While!,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,1506,"['First', 'Born', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'think', 'described', 'horror', 'actually', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'wonderful', 'woman', 'who', 'thrust', 'depths', 'insanity', 'having', 'first', 'born', 'child.Laura', 'Shue', 'husband', 'Steven', 'Steven', 'Mackintosh', 'seem', 'be', 'perfect', 'couple', 'are', 'young', 'wealthy', 'stable', 'only', 'thing', 'complete', 'union', 'baby', 'soon', 'get', 'wish.What', 'so', 'different', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pinpoint', 'what', 'demise', 'Laura', 'sanity', 'wan', 'na', 'say', 'postpartum', 'depression', 'Laura', 'having', 'visions', 'becoming', 'paranoid', 'even', 'baby', 'born', 'Once', 'Jessica', 'lives', 'Laura', 'battle', 'sanity', 'long', 'even', 'audience', ""n't"", 'know', 'coming', 'going.This', 'film', 'perfect', 'blend', 'suspense', 'thrills', ""n't"", 'in-your-face', 'horror', 'still', 'elements', 'are', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'film', 'so', 'mysterious.Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'fine', 'actress', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'role', 'apart', 'goodie-two-shoes', 'characters', 'usually', 'felt', 'Mackintosh', 'who', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'many', 'things', 'was', 'wasted', 'only', 'role', 'was', 'being', 'clueless', 'husband', 'times', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'clueless.It', 'been', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thriller', 'think', 'was', 'entertaining', 'experience.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Hitchcock-like', 'films', 'then', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'one']",First Born

If you want to hear more, I must warn you that much of the rest of this review could be considered a spoiler.When you look at the box and read the description, it sounds for all the world like the film will be an old-school creepy horror movie.  Haunted house kinda thing.  It most emphatically is NOT.This movie is an exploration of Post-Partum depression and Post-partum psychosis.  It is told pretty much from the mother's (victim's) point of view and this makes it seem like a thriller or horror movie...because her perceptions are so whacked out.  (It makes me a little sad to see some of the other reviews here talking about how frustrating a character Elizabeth Shue plays...the woman is suffering from a mental illness folks!)From that regard, I suppose it is an unusual, and perhaps to a limited degree illuminating, movie.  It is also VERY slowly paced, poorly cast and mostly unsatisfying.  It is an hour-long episode of a cable TV show spread out over 90 minutes.Years ago, Elizabeth Shue was nominated for an Oscar for LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  Her work in that movie and just a few others WAS pretty good.  But for the most part, she really isn't a good actress.  Also, the script lets her down, because we never get to see her as a normal, nice person.  She is moody and kinda unlikeable right from the start...so we aren't terribly invested in her story.The other performers in the film are mostly dreadful.  The British actor playing her husband is bland and the ""faux Eastern European"" actress playing the nanny is over the top...almost from a movie from the '30s or '40s.The movie shows its low budget roots by having many scenes with supporting characters who don't speak.  It's cheaper to pay an extra with no lines than a bit player with one line...so when  Shue's character is giving birth...no one in the delivery room utters a line.  I suppose some would argue that this contributes to understanding her feelings of isolation...but I found it unreasonably distracting.It was a mildly interesting film...but not what we were expecting.  If you want a straight exploration of one woman's unsettling descent into madness...you might like it okay.  For me, I just sort of endured it so I could see what happened at the end.
