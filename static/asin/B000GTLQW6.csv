1007197,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000GTLQW6,Caleb Williams,"[0, 0]","I first saw this show on a plane on my way to New York City, I've always been familiar with Lewis Black and his kind of work, but have never seen a complete show. One thing I have to say about Black is the irreverence of his comedy is truly superb. Whereas some comedians find themselves beating around the proberbial Bush when dealing with political issues and opinions. There are other comedians who do poke at politicians and political issues in an objective way but none like Lewis Black. He's foul mouthed, he's Jewish and possibly the most intelligent American comedian since Bill Hicks.Bill himself describes his style of humour as """"being on the Titanic every single day and being the only person who knows what is going to happen."" This is so true of the man as when he's delivering his comedy, you feel that he's going to fall apart. He's also said in the past that rather then write down his jokes, he simply talks about a subject that makes him angry and only changes the subject when he comes close to having a stroke.He has a look on the world that we all do, yet he puts an extreme comic twist on the whole thing. We've all read the paper and seen the news and thought to ourselves ""what the hell are they doing?"" Lewis Black is at the forefront of this and makes us all curl up in stitches of laughter as he explains to us the Dick Cheney incident in his own trademark way. Although it's unlikely, Black gives me the impression that he's improvising the entire routine from something he read in the paper that day. It could be possible, but I'd hate to say that it's highly doubtful.Looking at how long Black has been on the comedy scene, I'm genuinely surprised that he isn't a bigger personality on an international scale. One thing's for sure and that he's a man who never fails to make me laugh, and he simply makes you want to watch the news to see what he's seeing.",5,Irreverence Is His Middle Name,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,1887,"['first', 'saw', 'show', 'plane', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'City', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'familiar', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'kind', 'work', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'complete', 'show', 'One', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'Black', 'irreverence', 'comedy', 'truly', 'superb', 'comedians', 'find', 'beating', 'proberbial', 'Bush', 'when', 'dealing', 'political', 'issues', 'opinions', 'are', 'other', 'comedians', 'who', 'do', 'poke', 'politicians', 'political', 'issues', 'objective', 'way', 'none', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'Jewish', 'possibly', 'most', 'intelligent', 'American', 'comedian', 'Bill', 'Hicks.Bill', 'style', 'humour', 'being', 'Titanic', 'single', 'day', 'being', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'so', 'true', 'man', 'when', 'delivering', 'comedy', 'feel', 'going', 'fall', 'apart', 'also', 'said', 'past', 'rather', 'then', 'write', 'down', 'jokes', 'simply', 'subject', 'angry', 'only', 'changes', 'subject', 'when', 'close', 'having', 'stroke.He', 'look', 'world', 'do', 'yet', 'extreme', 'comic', 'twist', 'whole', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'read', 'paper', 'seen', 'news', 'thought', 'ourselves', 'what', 'hell', 'are', 'doing', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'forefront', 'curl', 'up', 'stitches', 'laughter', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'incident', 'own', 'trademark', 'way', 'unlikely', 'Black', 'impression', 'improvising', 'entire', 'routine', 'something', 'read', 'paper', 'day', 'could', 'be', 'possible', ""'d"", 'hate', 'say', 'highly', 'doubtful.Looking', 'how', 'long', 'Black', 'been', 'comedy', 'scene', ""'m"", 'genuinely', 'surprised', ""n't"", 'bigger', 'personality', 'international', 'scale', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'make', 'simply', 'want', 'watch', 'news', 'see', 'what', 'seeing']",N/A
