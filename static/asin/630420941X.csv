407549,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,630420941X,Andrew McCaffrey,"[0, 1]","I actually thought that I was going to dislike this episode much more than I eventually did.  You see, the name of the episode is DAX, and if I had to name the Deep Space Nine character that I found the least interested, my answer would also be Dax.  The character works for me on paper and in concept, but there just seems to be something lacking in execution.But fortunately, the episode surprised me somewhat.  The producers decided to focus most of story around Dax rather than with her.  She actually has comparatively little screen-time.  Most of the action revolves around people talking about her, or researching her, or learning about her.Unfortunately, I still didn't like the rest of the story all that much.  It's difficult to discuss exactly why without giving away spoilers, but I will point out generalities.  To begin with, the entire thrust of the episode is based upon the fundamental nature of the Trill species.  Trills are hybrid creatures; so, when the host body ages and dies, the secondary creature goes on living inside another person.  The episode asks the question of whether a later hybrid is responsible for the actions of the previous lifetime.  The symbiont has remained constant, but the host body is different.  Is Jadzia-Dax the same person as Curzon-Dax?  It's a very interesting question, and I really wish the story had done justice to the idea.The biggest annoyance for me was that the episode ends in an enormous cop-out.  It felt as though the writer(s) had been backed into a corner and didn't know how to resolve the central conflict -- so they cheated.  The resolution is the equivalent of distracting a person with a shiny object while slipping something past them while they weren't looking.  It's a shame that the episode didn't have the courage of its convictions.The direction seemed oddly stilted, and some of the blocking looked extremely awkward.  There's not a whole lot to recommend about this episode, especially since the most interesting thing this episode does is mishandle its central premise.  This was a blown opportunity.",2,A Murder Investigation That Ends In A Cop-Out,1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,2082,"['actually', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'dislike', 'episode', 'much', 'more', 'eventually', 'did', 'see', 'name', 'episode', 'DAX', 'had', 'name', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'character', 'found', 'least', 'interested', 'answer', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'Dax', 'character', 'paper', 'concept', 'there', 'just', 'be', 'something', 'lacking', 'execution.But', 'fortunately', 'episode', 'surprised', 'somewhat', 'producers', 'decided', 'focus', 'most', 'story', 'Dax', 'rather', 'actually', 'comparatively', 'little', 'screen-time', 'Most', 'action', 'people', 'talking', 'researching', 'learning', 'her.Unfortunately', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'rest', 'story', 'much', 'difficult', 'discuss', 'exactly', 'why', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'generalities', 'begin', 'entire', 'thrust', 'episode', 'based', 'fundamental', 'nature', 'Trill', 'species', 'Trills', 'are', 'hybrid', 'creatures', 'so', 'when', 'host', 'body', 'ages', 'dies', 'secondary', 'creature', 'living', 'person', 'episode', 'question', 'later', 'hybrid', 'responsible', 'actions', 'previous', 'lifetime', 'symbiont', 'remained', 'constant', 'host', 'body', 'different', 'Jadzia-Dax', 'same', 'person', 'Curzon-Dax', 'very', 'interesting', 'question', 'really', 'wish', 'story', 'had', 'done', 'justice', 'idea.The', 'biggest', 'annoyance', 'was', 'episode', 'enormous', 'cop-out', 'felt', 'writer', 's', 'had', 'been', 'backed', 'corner', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'resolve', 'central', 'conflict', 'cheated', 'resolution', 'equivalent', 'distracting', 'person', 'shiny', 'object', 'slipping', 'something', 'were', ""n't"", 'looking', 'shame', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'courage', 'convictions.The', 'direction', 'seemed', 'oddly', 'stilted', 'blocking', 'looked', 'extremely', 'awkward', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'recommend', 'episode', 'especially', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'episode', 'mishandle', 'central', 'premise', 'was', 'blown', 'opportunity']","Star Trek - Deep Space Nine, Episode 8: Dax VHS"
407550,AO37T54VEP0JQ,630420941X,"B.C. Scribe ""trekviewer""","[0, 0]","During the first season of any show a viewer can always expect to see shows dealing with the background and pertinent history of key individual players.  And that is exactly what 'Dax' is - a brief look into the life of the host of the Trill, Curzon Dax, nearly thirty years before Jadzia Dax was born and of course prior to her becoming a host.  Trekkies had gotten a composite analysis of a Trill in the TNG episode 'The Host' but here the alien species is examined and explained in a little further detail.After leaving the Promenade, Dax is followed to her quarters by a trio of alien beings who get her attention, violently take her as a hostage and start to make their way back to their ship.  Bashir, who imagines himself getting an invitation to her quarters, also comes along a few moments later and though surprised by the scene tries to rescue her.  After failing he contacts the bridge and the aliens are effectively cutoff from escape and themselves taken prisoner by Odo and the DS9 security staff.  The aliens however produce legitimate extradition papers for Dax - though it is actually Curzon Dax they are seeking and not Jadzia Dax.  It seems that Curzon Dax is charged with treason and the murder of General Ardelon Tandro on Klaestron IV; the arresting officer is also the general's son, which complicate matters further.  Sisko is forced by circumstance to hold an extradition hearing on the station and curiously he gets very little help from Dax in an attempt to halt the extradition.  Initially Sisko, acting as Dax's lawyer, is quite convincing but as the hearing progresses the dire straits continually grow worse - and then Odo, who has traveled to Klaestron IV, uncovers the most damning evidence of all...and it may mean that Dax will face the death penalty.Considering the daunting task of inventing a background for such a complex being this is a remarkable and surprisingly well-done episode.  Defining the separate lives that the Trill has lived prior to being hosted by Jadzia is going to be bound to any future storylines so the writers, Trek veteran D.C. Fontana and Peter Allan Fields, tread very fine ground and come out of it O.K.  How is a host chosen?  What happens to the person once they become a host?  What becomes of their personality and lifes' experiences after they are joined with a Trill?  Can a host change their mind after becoming a host?  These questions and more are brought to light and answered relatively well.  Some that aren't brought up are: How does a new host come to peace with all the lives that the Trill has lived?  Initially there must be some confusion and turmoil, an internal war of personalities battling for dominance.  Also, since Trill beings can alternately inhabit either a male or female host in separate lives doesn't this cause quite a bit of gender identification confusion?  Naturally the creative staff wouldn't want to venture too far into this territory because it could become too compromising when considering future episodes about Dax.  They try to cover a lot of background on what a Trill is but ultimately the focus is actually on the trial at hand and it eventually takes precedence in the show.The quality of guest stars that the Trek staff is able to get continually surprises me.  Anne Haney is absolutely superb as the judge sent from Bajor for the hearing.  Gregory Itzin, playing Ilon Tandro, has portrayed lawyers in other previous television shows and does a fine job here as well.  Fionnula Flanagan, who plays the part of Enina Tandro, has also appeared in TNG's 'Inheritance' episode playing Dr. Julianna O'Donnell Soong Tainer, the long missing wife of Dr. Noonian Soong and just recently appeared in a first season episode of ""Enterprise"" as the Vulcan ambassador V'Lar.Note: There is a brief moment at the end of 'Dax' where a former lover - a female in this case - touches one of Jadzia's cheeks instead of kissing her and Jadzia immediately puts her fingers on the area where she has just been touched.  It's effective and, in hindsight, the best way to handle this potentially explosive and objectionable scene.  A few seasons later they would feel relaxed enough to tackle the issue in the episode 'Rejoined'.",4,'Dax' or 'The Tumultuous Times Of A Trill',1045958400,"02 23, 2003",2003,4220,"['first', 'season', 'show', 'viewer', 'can', 'always', 'expect', 'see', 'shows', 'dealing', 'background', 'pertinent', 'history', 'key', 'individual', 'players', 'exactly', 'what', ""'Dax"", 'brief', 'look', 'life', 'host', 'Trill', 'Curzon', 'Dax', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'Jadzia', 'Dax', 'was', 'born', 'course', 'prior', 'becoming', 'host', 'Trekkies', 'had', 'gotten', 'composite', 'analysis', 'Trill', 'TNG', 'episode', 'Host', 'here', 'alien', 'species', 'examined', 'explained', 'little', 'further', 'detail.After', 'leaving', 'Promenade', 'Dax', 'followed', 'quarters', 'trio', 'alien', 'beings', 'who', 'get', 'attention', 'violently', 'take', 'hostage', 'start', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'ship', 'Bashir', 'who', 'getting', 'invitation', 'quarters', 'also', 'few', 'moments', 'later', 'surprised', 'scene', 'rescue', 'failing', 'bridge', 'aliens', 'are', 'effectively', 'cutoff', 'escape', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Odo', 'DS9', 'security', 'staff', 'aliens', 'however', 'produce', 'legitimate', 'extradition', 'papers', 'Dax', 'actually', 'Curzon', 'Dax', 'are', 'seeking', 'not', 'Jadzia', 'Dax', 'Curzon', 'Dax', 'charged', 'treason', 'murder', 'General', 'Ardelon', 'Tandro', 'Klaestron', 'IV', 'arresting', 'officer', 'also', 'general', 'son', 'complicate', 'matters', 'further', 'Sisko', 'forced', 'circumstance', 'hold', 'extradition', 'hearing', 'station', 'curiously', 'very', 'little', 'help', 'Dax', 'attempt', 'halt', 'extradition', 'Initially', 'Sisko', 'acting', 'Dax', 'lawyer', 'quite', 'convincing', 'hearing', 'dire', 'straits', 'continually', 'grow', 'worse', 'then', 'Odo', 'who', 'traveled', 'Klaestron', 'IV', 'most', 'damning', 'evidence', 'may', 'mean', 'Dax', 'will', 'face', 'death', 'penalty.Considering', 'daunting', 'task', 'inventing', 'background', 'such', 'complex', 'being', 'remarkable', 'surprisingly', 'well-done', 'episode', 'Defining', 'separate', 'lives', 'Trill', 'lived', 'prior', 'being', 'hosted', 'Jadzia', 'going', 'be', 'bound', 'future', 'storylines', 'writers', 'Trek', 'veteran', 'D.C.', 'Fontana', 'Peter', 'Allan', 'Fields', 'tread', 'very', 'fine', 'ground', 'come', 'O.K', 'How', 'host', 'chosen', 'What', 'person', 'become', 'host', 'What', 'personality', 'lifes', 'experiences', 'are', 'joined', 'Trill', 'Can', 'host', 'change', 'mind', 'becoming', 'host', 'questions', 'more', 'are', 'brought', 'light', 'answered', 'relatively', 'well', 'are', ""n't"", 'brought', 'up', 'are', 'How', 'new', 'host', 'come', 'peace', 'lives', 'Trill', 'lived', 'Initially', 'must', 'be', 'confusion', 'turmoil', 'internal', 'war', 'personalities', 'battling', 'dominance', 'Also', 'Trill', 'beings', 'can', 'alternately', 'inhabit', 'male', 'female', 'host', 'separate', 'lives', ""n't"", 'cause', 'quite', 'bit', 'gender', 'identification', 'confusion', 'Naturally', 'creative', 'staff', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'venture', 'too', 'far', 'territory', 'could', 'become', 'too', 'compromising', 'when', 'considering', 'future', 'episodes', 'Dax', 'try', 'cover', 'lot', 'background', 'what', 'Trill', 'ultimately', 'focus', 'actually', 'trial', 'hand', 'eventually', 'precedence', 'show.The', 'quality', 'guest', 'stars', 'Trek', 'staff', 'able', 'get', 'continually', 'surprises', 'Anne', 'Haney', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'judge', 'sent', 'Bajor', 'hearing', 'Gregory', 'Itzin', 'playing', 'Ilon', 'Tandro', 'portrayed', 'lawyers', 'other', 'previous', 'television', 'shows', 'fine', 'job', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'who', 'part', 'Enina', 'Tandro', 'also', 'appeared', 'TNG', ""'Inheritance"", 'episode', 'playing', 'Dr.', 'Julianna', ""O'Donnell"", 'Soong', 'Tainer', 'long', 'missing', 'wife', 'Dr.', 'Noonian', 'Soong', 'just', 'recently', 'appeared', 'first', 'season', 'episode', 'Enterprise', 'Vulcan', 'ambassador', ""V'Lar.Note"", 'brief', 'moment', 'end', ""'Dax"", 'where', 'former', 'lover', 'female', 'case', 'one', 'Jadzia', 'cheeks', 'instead', 'kissing', 'Jadzia', 'immediately', 'fingers', 'area', 'where', 'just', 'been', 'touched', 'effective', 'hindsight', 'best', 'way', 'handle', 'potentially', 'explosive', 'objectionable', 'scene', 'few', 'seasons', 'later', 'would', 'feel', 'relaxed', 'enough', 'tackle', 'issue', 'episode', ""'Rejoined""]","Star Trek - Deep Space Nine, Episode 8: Dax VHS"

407554,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,630420941X,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[1, 1]","As Dax & Dr. Bashir drink coffee on the Promenade, aliens peer at them from what appear to be the vents from a home air conditioning system - thankfully, the set decorators for DS9 started improving their props as the series kept moving along. The aliens watch and follow Dax as she heads off to her quarters in an attempt to subdue her. Bashir happens upon them as they have her in a choke hold, but the Starfleet trained officer who is shaped like a pipe-cleaner man tries to take on 3 unknown species by himself instead of calling security. Pulllease! And he's not even disciplined later for his unprofessional behavior. After he regains consciousness, he uses his combadge to contact Ops instead of station security. What?  While Dax is clearly the only Trill on board DS9 at the time, the station scanners just look for her combadge and can't locate her - whatever. At least if they had blamed the internal scanners - another problem the Cardies left behind, this would have been easier to swallow, but the holes continue like Swiss Cheese.The method in which the aliens make their escape, defeating every obstacle in their path, is very intriguing and suspense builds until they are finally captured and confronted for assault and kidnapping. The leader of this band of kidnappers is Ilon Tandro (Gregory Itzin) of Klaestron IV. He shows Sisko his warrant for Dax's arrest on chargest of Treason and murder 30 years earlier. The Federation has a treaty with Klaestron IV and must abide by the warrant.Sisko ponders - if their orders are legit - why would they go through all this cloak & dagger stuff to secrety steal Dax away? There's also the problem with a 30 year old murder and a 28 year old Jadzia Dax. It is Dax's former host, Curzon, who is accused of the crime. The long-dead friend and mentor of Sisko was far from being the exemplary Trill, but Sisko knows that Curzon was not a murderer. He sends Odo on a fact-finding mission to Klaestron IV to investigate the facts.The crew is frustrated because Jadzia seems sad, yet refuses to defend herself. When questioned by Sisko, she refuses to tell him what happened when he was a Federation liaison to Klaestron and Sisko is in the unenviable position of defending Dax when it appears Dax is ready to accept her fate. The crimes of which her symbiont is accused carry the death penalty.When Odo uncovers that Curzon was shacking up with the late General's wife at the time of his murder, Sisko believes he now knows why Jadzia has been closed-mouthed and confronts her with this information. He does not hit pay dirt. There is something else the ""old man"" is hiding and Sisko begins to wonder if Curzon did commit these crimes after all.When Sisko finds that Tandro's warrant is in order, he fires the only flare he has at his disposal - the station is Bajoran and Bajor does not have an extradition treaty with Klaestron, so they have an extradition hearing on the station, overseen by a Bajoran judge who is over 100 years old and she tells the parties, ""I want to be home by supper, not senility.""Instead of getting a Judge Advocate General shipped in from Star Fleet to defend Dax, Sisko defends Dax himself. This was most cheesy, if you ask me - and Tandro, whose own father is the one Dax supposedly murdered, is in the position of arguing the prosecution side to get Dax extradited. Tandro obviously has a personal obsession to seek out revenge and Sisko is too emotionally involved to be affected, but without this set up, where would be the theatrics?The interesting theme is the discussion of how much of Curzon is in Jadzia. They shared the same symbiont, Dax, but just because Jadzia remembers Curzon's memories - does this mean she is the same person as Curzon? Does this mean she is guilty of crimes he or previous hosts may have committed?There aren't enough symbionts to go around - not every Trill wants to be ""joined"" but many do who never get the chance. It is considered to be a great honor to be joined and those who wish to be joined must go through years of academic, psychological and physical tests to prove their ability and worthiness to be joined. They consider the symbiont to be of more value than the host, because it shares the experiences of many lifetimes, yet no ambassador from Trill arrives to defend the symbiont. Trill has a treaty with the Federation, yet they make no request for asylum for the symbiont - holes holes holes!The story is entertaining in spates, but holes abound. The episode has value in that it helps people to better understand the ""worm"" inside of Jadzia and to better understand who's who in the world of Trills - but that's about it.",3,interesting themes and some character development,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,4659,"['Dax', 'Dr.', 'Bashir', 'drink', 'coffee', 'Promenade', 'peer', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'vents', 'home', 'air', 'conditioning', 'system', 'thankfully', 'set', 'decorators', 'DS9', 'started', 'improving', 'props', 'series', 'kept', 'moving', 'along', 'aliens', 'watch', 'follow', 'Dax', 'quarters', 'attempt', 'subdue', 'Bashir', 'upon', 'have', 'her', 'choke', 'hold', 'Starfleet', 'trained', 'officer', 'who', 'shaped', 'pipe-cleaner', 'man', 'take', '3', 'unknown', 'species', 'instead', 'calling', 'security', 'Pulllease', 'not', 'even', 'disciplined', 'later', 'unprofessional', 'behavior', 'consciousness', 'combadge', 'contact', 'Ops', 'instead', 'station', 'security', 'What', 'Dax', 'clearly', 'only', 'Trill', 'board', 'DS9', 'time', 'station', 'scanners', 'just', 'look', 'combadge', 'ca', ""n't"", 'locate', 'whatever', 'least', 'had', 'blamed', 'internal', 'scanners', 'problem', 'Cardies', 'left', 'behind', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'swallow', 'holes', 'continue', 'Swiss', 'Cheese.The', 'method', 'aliens', 'make', 'escape', 'defeating', 'obstacle', 'path', 'very', 'intriguing', 'suspense', 'builds', 'are', 'finally', 'captured', 'confronted', 'assault', 'kidnapping', 'leader', 'band', 'kidnappers', 'Ilon', 'Tandro', 'Gregory', 'Itzin', 'Klaestron', 'IV', 'Sisko', 'warrant', 'Dax', 'arrest', 'chargest', 'Treason', 'murder', '30', 'years', 'earlier', 'Federation', 'treaty', 'Klaestron', 'IV', 'must', 'abide', 'warrant.Sisko', 'ponders', 'orders', 'are', 'legit', 'why', 'would', 'go', 'cloak', 'dagger', 'stuff', 'secrety', 'steal', 'Dax', 'away', 'also', 'problem', '30', 'year', 'old', 'murder', '28', 'year', 'old', 'Jadzia', 'Dax', 'Dax', 'former', 'host', 'Curzon', 'who', 'accused', 'crime', 'long-dead', 'friend', 'mentor', 'Sisko', 'was', 'far', 'being', 'exemplary', 'Trill', 'Sisko', 'Curzon', 'was', 'not', 'murderer', 'Odo', 'fact-finding', 'mission', 'Klaestron', 'IV', 'investigate', 'facts.The', 'crew', 'frustrated', 'Jadzia', 'sad', 'yet', 'defend', 'When', 'questioned', 'Sisko', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'was', 'Federation', 'liaison', 'Klaestron', 'Sisko', 'unenviable', 'position', 'defending', 'Dax', 'when', 'Dax', 'ready', 'accept', 'fate', 'crimes', 'symbiont', 'accused', 'carry', 'death', 'penalty.When', 'Odo', 'uncovers', 'Curzon', 'was', 'shacking', 'up', 'late', 'General', 'wife', 'time', 'murder', 'Sisko', 'now', 'why', 'Jadzia', 'been', 'closed-mouthed', 'information', 'not', 'hit', 'pay', 'dirt', 'something', 'else', 'old', 'man', 'hiding', 'Sisko', 'wonder', 'Curzon', 'did', 'commit', 'crimes', 'all.When', 'Sisko', 'Tandro', 'warrant', 'order', 'only', 'flare', 'disposal', 'station', 'Bajoran', 'Bajor', 'not', 'have', 'extradition', 'treaty', 'Klaestron', 'have', 'extradition', 'hearing', 'station', 'overseen', 'Bajoran', 'judge', 'who', '100', 'years', 'old', 'parties', 'want', 'be', 'home', 'supper', 'not', 'senility', 'Instead', 'getting', 'Judge', 'Advocate', 'General', 'shipped', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'defend', 'Dax', 'Sisko', 'Dax', 'was', 'most', 'cheesy', 'ask', 'Tandro', 'own', 'father', 'one', 'Dax', 'supposedly', 'murdered', 'position', 'arguing', 'prosecution', 'side', 'get', 'Dax', 'extradited', 'Tandro', 'obviously', 'personal', 'obsession', 'seek', 'out', 'revenge', 'Sisko', 'too', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'be', 'affected', 'set', 'up', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'theatrics', 'interesting', 'theme', 'discussion', 'how', 'much', 'Curzon', 'Jadzia', 'shared', 'same', 'symbiont', 'Dax', 'just', 'Jadzia', 'remembers', 'Curzon', 'memories', 'mean', 'same', 'person', 'Curzon', 'mean', 'guilty', 'crimes', 'previous', 'hosts', 'may', 'have', 'committed', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'symbionts', 'go', 'around', 'not', 'Trill', 'be', 'joined', 'many', 'do', 'who', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'considered', 'be', 'great', 'honor', 'be', 'joined', 'who', 'wish', 'be', 'joined', 'must', 'go', 'years', 'academic', 'psychological', 'physical', 'tests', 'prove', 'ability', 'worthiness', 'be', 'joined', 'consider', 'symbiont', 'be', 'more', 'value', 'host', 'shares', 'experiences', 'many', 'lifetimes', 'yet', 'ambassador', 'Trill', 'defend', 'symbiont', 'Trill', 'treaty', 'Federation', 'yet', 'make', 'request', 'asylum', 'symbiont', 'holes', 'holes', 'holes', 'story', 'entertaining', 'spates', 'holes', 'abound', 'episode', 'value', 'people', 'better', 'understand', 'worm', 'Jadzia', 'better', 'understand', 'who', 'who', 'world', 'Trills']","Star Trek - Deep Space Nine, Episode 8: Dax VHS"
