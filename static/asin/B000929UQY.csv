899854,AO4WFALWQYTW0,B000929UQY,"Bobby Hami ""Ultimateserge""","[2, 7]","In his last film, Robert Bresson attempts a psychological study of man in the lowest and most depressed part of his life as the cards fate hands him go terribly wrong. A spiral of events start from a petty crime done by two teenagers whose forged money, exchanged in a store, lands an unsuspecting youth in dire straits.Bresson paints a black and white universe where a single person is continually being tricked, harmed, and manipulated by a large mass of people whom see money as the sole source of motivation. This young man, named Yvon, is unable to rise from this elementary act of manipulation, and due to loss of his job, falls into crime, and eventually jail. Loss of members of his family and time in solitary confinement make this bumpy ride all the more psychologically abusing which contributes to the young man's eventual downfall.Bresson paints this film in a world of coldness, bitterness, apathy which does suit the character's infatuation with money quite well; the problem lies in the desire of the film for the audience to feel sorry for the main character. I must respond, for what, and even if there was a sufficient answer to such a question, why? The true arbitrators of the immoral acts that land the main character in prison don't crack a smile, shed a tear, or show any remote sign of emotion through the entire film; however, that could be excusable, being blamed on their sheer interest in money and unconcerned about the method of its gain. However, the sole character, himself, seems to lack the faculties of emotion, with no true recognizable emotion toward his wife-besides placing his hands on her shoulder or back. During her sole visit with her husband in prison, his wife remindshim that they should not resolve to fighting in such a condition as they never have quarreled before. This is not such a difficult concept considering that these people don't exist-not because they are in a film-but mainly due to the fact that most people expend energy and emotion rather than function as pre-programmed citizens in a world taken over by money and deceit. However, this is still excusable if the film did not demand us to feel sorry for these characters who could not express ""sorry"" if you asked them.Another issue with the problem is the unfocused narrative of the film. There are scenes, such as the introduction of the protagonist, that seem fuzzy and unclear, and for some individuals a second watch may be required so that certain ambiguities become clear. A narration would not be necessary, but due to the apathy of the characters, it would help the film progress more smoothly and seem, at certain points, less tedious.There is no doubt that Bresson intended this chilling atmosphere to resonate through the entire film, but unfortunately this style of his overpowers the film and the philosophy he intends us to infer from it. By the end of the film, we have not seen a film that displayed to us the root of all evil, or a critique of French society, but we have witnessed a film that is depressing; so depressing and banal that any message that lays within it seems void, empty, and uninteresting.",1,As Cold as Ice,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,3140,"['last', 'film', 'Robert', 'Bresson', 'psychological', 'study', 'man', 'lowest', 'most', 'depressed', 'part', 'life', 'cards', 'fate', 'hands', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'spiral', 'events', 'start', 'petty', 'crime', 'done', 'two', 'teenagers', 'forged', 'money', 'exchanged', 'store', 'unsuspecting', 'youth', 'dire', 'straits.Bresson', 'black', 'white', 'universe', 'where', 'single', 'person', 'continually', 'being', 'tricked', 'harmed', 'manipulated', 'large', 'mass', 'people', 'whom', 'see', 'money', 'sole', 'source', 'motivation', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Yvon', 'unable', 'rise', 'elementary', 'act', 'manipulation', 'due', 'loss', 'job', 'crime', 'eventually', 'jail', 'Loss', 'members', 'family', 'time', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'make', 'bumpy', 'ride', 'more', 'psychologically', 'abusing', 'young', 'man', 'eventual', 'downfall.Bresson', 'paints', 'film', 'world', 'coldness', 'bitterness', 'apathy', 'suit', 'character', 'infatuation', 'money', 'quite', 'well', 'problem', 'desire', 'film', 'audience', 'feel', 'sorry', 'main', 'character', 'must', 'respond', 'what', 'even', 'was', 'sufficient', 'answer', 'question', 'why', 'true', 'arbitrators', 'immoral', 'acts', 'land', 'main', 'character', 'prison', 'do', ""n't"", 'crack', 'smile', 'shed', 'tear', 'show', 'remote', 'sign', 'emotion', 'entire', 'film', 'however', 'could', 'be', 'excusable', 'being', 'blamed', 'sheer', 'interest', 'money', 'unconcerned', 'method', 'gain', 'However', 'sole', 'character', 'lack', 'faculties', 'emotion', 'true', 'recognizable', 'emotion', 'wife-besides', 'placing', 'hands', 'shoulder', 'back', 'sole', 'visit', 'husband', 'prison', 'wife', 'remindshim', 'should', 'not', 'resolve', 'fighting', 'such', 'condition', 'never', 'have', 'quarreled', 'before', 'not', 'such', 'difficult', 'concept', 'considering', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist-not', 'are', 'film-but', 'mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'most', 'people', 'expend', 'energy', 'emotion', 'rather', 'function', 'pre-programmed', 'citizens', 'world', 'taken', 'over', 'money', 'deceit', 'However', 'still', 'excusable', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'demand', 'feel', 'sorry', 'characters', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'express', 'sorry', 'asked', 'issue', 'problem', 'unfocused', 'narrative', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'such', 'introduction', 'protagonist', 'seem', 'fuzzy', 'unclear', 'individuals', 'second', 'watch', 'may', 'be', 'required', 'so', 'certain', 'ambiguities', 'become', 'clear', 'narration', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'necessary', 'due', 'apathy', 'characters', 'would', 'help', 'film', 'progress', 'more', 'smoothly', 'seem', 'certain', 'points', 'less', 'doubt', 'Bresson', 'intended', 'chilling', 'atmosphere', 'resonate', 'entire', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'style', 'overpowers', 'film', 'philosophy', 'infer', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'displayed', 'root', 'evil', 'critique', 'French', 'society', 'have', 'witnessed', 'film', 'depressing', 'depressing', 'banal', 'message', 'void', 'empty', 'uninteresting']",N/A
899855,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B000929UQY,Buenoslibros.es,"[1, 3]","Last film by acclaimed French director Robert Bresson. In color. 1hour and 20 minutes.This film is very different, at first glance, from other Bresson classics. The pace is very fast (specially the first half), the streets of Paris in all its rush and chaos. The insides of homes and shops are remnants of peace and soberness (only apparently), trying to protect from the ""evil"" outside. The characters are practically all young people, lost souls, and for a reason: ""they lack the inner resources necessary to make the kind of leap that 'Pickpocket's Michel or 'A Man Escaped's Fontaine makes. They lack sufficient experience to understand that one can have faith in something other than such paltry, man-made creations as ""progress"" and money.""Those were the words of essayist Kent Jones in the case insert.The second half of the film moves to a more rural setting. The pace slows down. We meet a very noteworthy character. A woman with faith, lots of faith. In one scene they share a few moments of peace and give the film more meaning than I can try to explain with my limited English vocabulary. But it's the climax, and then comes the tragedy, which is like the final statement of the author, Bresson.I didn't like the film as much as ""Diary of a country priest"", and way less than ""Au Hazard Balthasar"", maybe because of its pessimistic taste, the lack of hope. Probably I don't like it that much because, simply put, modernity is ugly. And postmodernity is infinitely more so.But faith, hope and love are never in vain for those who love God, and belief in the resurrection of His Son Jesus.",4,On greed and corruption,1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,1599,"['Last', 'film', 'acclaimed', 'French', 'director', 'Robert', 'Bresson', 'color', '1hour', '20', 'minutes.This', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'first', 'glance', 'other', 'Bresson', 'classics', 'pace', 'very', 'fast', 'specially', 'first', 'half', 'streets', 'Paris', 'rush', 'chaos', 'insides', 'homes', 'shops', 'are', 'remnants', 'peace', 'soberness', 'only', 'apparently', 'trying', 'protect', 'evil', 'outside', 'characters', 'are', 'practically', 'young', 'people', 'lost', 'souls', 'reason', 'lack', 'inner', 'resources', 'necessary', 'make', 'kind', 'leap', ""'Pickpocket"", 'Michel', 'Man', 'Escaped', 'Fontaine', 'lack', 'sufficient', 'experience', 'understand', 'one', 'can', 'have', 'faith', 'something', 'other', 'such', 'paltry', 'man-made', 'creations', 'progress', 'money', 'were', 'words', 'essayist', 'Kent', 'Jones', 'case', 'insert.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'moves', 'more', 'rural', 'setting', 'pace', 'down', 'meet', 'very', 'noteworthy', 'character', 'woman', 'faith', 'lots', 'faith', 'one', 'scene', 'share', 'few', 'moments', 'peace', 'give', 'film', 'more', 'meaning', 'can', 'try', 'explain', 'limited', 'English', 'vocabulary', 'climax', 'then', 'tragedy', 'final', 'statement', 'author', 'Bresson.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'as', 'much', 'Diary', 'country', 'priest', 'way', 'less', 'Au', 'Hazard', 'Balthasar', 'maybe', 'pessimistic', 'taste', 'lack', 'hope', 'Probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'that', 'much', 'simply', 'put', 'modernity', 'ugly', 'postmodernity', 'infinitely', 'more', 'so.But', 'faith', 'hope', 'love', 'are', 'never', 'vain', 'who', 'love', 'God', 'belief', 'resurrection', 'Son', 'Jesus']",N/A
899856,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000929UQY,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[7, 8]","This is Bresson's greatest, and last, work.  It is a work from a true cinematic auteur.  No one made films like Bresson did, and I don't think anyone ever will.  This film is based on a short story by Tolstoy entitled The Forged Coupon (aka The Forged Note), except Tolstoy's story is much different that Bresson's take here.  It is about how a forged note of 500 francs passes from one hand to another, ruining the life of a fuel oil delivery man.  Bresson made this film when he was 82, but you couldn't tell that it was made by a man that old.  Quite often, critics assume that filmmakers (and artists in general) have nothing to say as they get older.  On the contrary.  They have even more to say.  A real artist's vision deepens as they grow older.  Kurosawa made Ran at 75, and Eastwood made Million Dollar Baby at 74.  Those are their best films.  Bresson is rather feisty and combative (which is a good thing) in the interviews presented here.  He doesn't mince words, and he doesn't seem interested in doing the usual inane questions that featurettes on DVD's usually have from bubble headed reporters (even though these were shot for French TV, not Entertainment Tonight).  He has something to say.  This is my favorite film of his (even though Lancelot of the Lake and Au Hasard Balthazar are close behind).  Sadly, he never made another one after this, but the 13 he did make are all brilliant.  Not one bad one.

899859,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000929UQY,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 6]","Bresson captures the truth through his silence of human emotions where the sensations triggered by futile motifs such as smiles, frowns, and other expressions of feelings are repressed.  In the light of Jean-Luc Godard many could probably argue that there is still a lie present in Bresson's films, as Godard once stated, ""Every edit is a lie"".  Nonetheless, the intentions of Bresson are sincere, as the actions on the screen are what he wanted the audience to observe, not the acted part, the extravagantly flamboyant expression of feelings that could cloud the viewer's perspective of the truth.  All of the emotional aspects could be characteristics of an actor acting where the act itself becomes an intricate lie that tries to convince the audience to react through words disguised in emotions.  Instead of showing the deceitfulness of expressive sentiments and reactions of the body and face Bresson strips down all scenes of emotions to only leave the audience with what truly counts - actions.Those who never had the pleasure to be initiated in Bresson's stylistic cinema, might find it awkward and obtuse.  Yet, if reflection were to be provided a different perspective might arise, which could deepen the observers notions of what they would see in cinema and in life.  Many of the critics considered Bresson an old spirit from old days of cinema when he released L'Argent while they ought to have considered him as a cinematic innovator that did not conform to traditional narratives.  Despite his unconstructive critics, who actually helped him secure his place in time among the cinematic scholars, his final film provides an intriguing tale of guilt in L'Argent.  He based L'Argent on a personal adaptation of Tolstoy's The Forged Coupon, which deals with the fate of forgery.Innocently, the teen Norbert asks for his monthly allowance while also trying to ask for a little more, but the father refuses to provide the extra money for his son.  It is in this opening where the consequences of a horrific crime are about to take form, Norbert asks his friend Martial for financial backing.  Martial has a forged 500 Francs bill, which they pass off in a small camera store where they buy a cheap frame.  The owner of the store realizes later on that they have received a forged bill, and he also received two more at an earlier occasion.  Instead of contacting the police the storeowner decides to pass the bills to someone else, and this unfortunate person happens to be Yvon Targe who gets paid with the forged bills for providing house oil.  In the scenes where the money switches hands the camera dutifully studies the hand movements and the simplicity social destruction can be spread.Yvon is charged for trying to use the forged bills, and he brings the police to the camera store where he receievd the forged bills.  The storeowner informs the police that he has never seen him before and his assistant Lucien supports his testimony.  This unfortunate event causes Yvon to loose his job, which leads him into a desperate situation where he tries to raise money quickly to save his family form further financial misery.  However, the situation backfires when he first does not share with his wife what he is about to do, and second, he gets arrested and sentenced to jail for being an accomplice to a bank robbery.  Parallel to Yvon's story the audience gets to follow a true criminal, Lucien, the camera store assistant, who is fired and later robs his former employer.  Lucien accumulates a large sum of money through several illegal activities.  Through the illusion of wealth his arrogance grows, and his ignorance of consequence leads him to become a Robin Hood character who donates to the poor including his former boss.  This is a mistake that eventually sends him to prison where he meets Yvon.The jail sentence becomes the beginning of a long downward spiraling journey for Yvon.  When Lucien arrives to the jail they have a brief, but essential conversation at a Catholic mass.  The irony that Bresson applies in this sequence is profound while Lucien declares to Yvon, ""Neither of us is a killer. We alone have no one on our conscience.""  To this Yvon responds, ""You have me on your conscience. You have to answer for that now.""  In the following scene Yvon wakes up to the alarm of Lucien's escape attempt.  His cellmate comforts him and says that they will never have to see him again, as Lucien would be transferred to high security prison. ""I will."", replies Yvon to his cellmate's effort to comfort him.  Soon after Lucien's escape attempt Yvon finds himself a free man, but instead of a peaceful lifestyle he retorts with violent crimes.The crimes that Yvon commits seem to be thoughtless acts of violence.  However, recalling the scene where he talked with Lucien presents the situation in a different light, even if it seems disturbing and callous.  The open ended conclusion of the story leaves the audience with a cliff hanger where several thoughts might run through the mind.  Initially, it might seem dark and gloomy, but it also leaves the audience with several options to consider that can steer the story in many possible directions.  The ending also leaves the viewers with a number of ideas to ponder.  One of these notions could possibly be the truth about absolute guilt.  It also questions whether innocence of an act and pure ignorance could be a crime.  These and many other issues are left for the audience to ponder and muse over while L'Argent slowly settles with an enigmatic vision of the truth.",5,Bresson's Last Vision - A Truthful Depiction of

899860,A2DEB4K5G9X21C,B000929UQY,Le_Samourai,"[1, 2]","A young man, Norbert (Marc-Ernest Fourneau), unsuccessfully asks his father for an advance in his allowance. He visits his friend, Martial (Bruno Lapeyre), and is goaded into passing a forged 500 franc note at a photography shop. The photographer (Didier Baussy) censures his business partner (Beatrice Tabourin) for accepting the forged banknote - the third counterfeit bill for the week - and decides to pass off the forged notes to an unsuspecting victim. When the serviceman from the oil company, Yvon Targe (Christian Patey), arrives to resupply their fuel tank, he is paid with the counterfeit bills. Yvon attempts to use the money to pay for a meal, and is detained by the police for forgery. In order to clear his name, Yvon hires an attorney to sue the photographer for fraud. But the photographer, unwilling to recant his false testimony despite the dire consequences it bears on the innocent Yvon, enlists his assistant, Lucien (Vincent Risterucci), to validate his claim and deny recognition of the serviceman as well. As a result of their perjured testimony, Yvon loses his job. Unable to find another job because of his tainted employment history, he descends into a life of crime, despair, and eventually, murder.Robert Bresson creates a harrowing, caustic and socially relevant indictment of materialism and amorality in his final masterpiece, L'Argent. The protagonist, Yvon, is first introduced through a shot of his hands as he connects the fuel supply line. As in Pickpocket, the image suggests a figurative fracture between the body and the soul. However, in L'Argent, the body is not a biological entity, but rather, a representation of a material one: the universal mechanism of money - created, utilized, circulated. In the impersonal detachment of contemporary society, money serves as the surrogate for human emotion - love, guilt, shame, devotion, trust - are frivolously expressed through its casual exchange. But money also exihibits a biological behavior in its virulence - the forged banknotes, in essence, contaminate everyone who comes into contact with them. Norbert is punished for his childish prank.

One spoiled brat passes a conferfeit French equivilent of a $100 bill and the misfortune that ensues affects many innocent people.  The movie does an outstanding job of portraying the people involved and that has the effect of drawing both towards and away from the various characters.  Some we will perceive as innocent and some as guilty as I think director Robert Bresson intended.  This lesson in morality works well until Bresson takes a leap too far in making his point.  Before we reach that extreme, however, we are convincingly reminded that innocence is not always rewared nor is guilt always punished.  Bresson goes beyond that to such lessons as the poor being always at a disadvantage in court when challenging the rich and that love often doesn't conquer much of anything.  Various characters end up in jail while other lose in other ways.In regards to the end, I will give nothing away (I hope) but I feel the need to complain about the excessive conclusion that Bresson seems to want us to end up with.  An innocent victim suffers one setback after another and he has our sympathy.  However, what gets passed along from his hands to others is in no way a logical next step as the director would have us believe.  Maybe others might think so.  However, for me this leap of logic ruined the film's message.

'Balthasar' and 'Diary of A Country Priest', are right up there with my all time favourites. Friends try to convince me that 'Lancelot'(his excurison into colour) and,'L'Argent' are classics too. I can't agree. The narrative here is quite simple and the morality, so stripped back that it it feels like a Sunday School lesson.Even in 'Lancelot', where the acting was bereft of emoting, there was some degree of intimacy, that facilitated connections for me. Here, the characters are rendered as automatons, which is clearly part of Bresson's intention, but makes for some unreal, de-animated cause and effect.

899865,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000929UQY,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","L'Argent is commonly hailed as Bresson's parting masterpiece, but sadly it's seriously undermined by atrocious performances and a completely unconvincing last reel. Which is a shame, because there's much to admire here. His adaptation of a Tolstoy short story about the disastrous consequences for the innocent recipient of a forged banknote has for the most part a terrific sense of narrative, exposing the way petty crime can have major moral repercussions throughout the social scale, with the rich able to buy or lie their way out of trouble. But oh, those performances! Bresson made a career out of soliciting convincing performances out of amateurs, so you have to wonder just why they are nearly all so very terrible here. Not only can they not act or give even the vaguest impression of life, intelligent or otherwise, but they move so mechanically - mannequin-like with back straight and arms down their sides like lead weights as they try to remember to hit their marks - that you wonder if Bresson actually intended the effect. Whether he did or not, it's like watching outtakes from a public information film at times, or the Swedish phrase book sketch from Monty Python. A couple of performers get by, but Christian Patey is so physically and verbally awkward in the lead that it's painful watching his progress, but in all the Wong ways.Yet for 70 minutes at least the strength of the narrative and Bresson's spare, economical telling lend it a relentless forward momentum, manage to hold you. Tragically, the film's resolution fails to convince in any way, turning its initially fundamentally decent protagonist into a money-hungry thrill-killer not as a logical consequence of his experiences but purely as a plot contrivance to prove a point and provide an ending. The final (offscreen) mass murder simply seems tacked-on sensationalism, especially considering the absurd set of circumstances that places him in the bosom of the family he kills.A good film but ultimately a frustrating and unrewarding one for all its strong points.",3,Disappointing but with moments of near-greatness,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,2049,"[""L'Argent"", 'commonly', 'hailed', 'Bresson', 'parting', 'masterpiece', 'sadly', 'seriously', 'undermined', 'atrocious', 'performances', 'completely', 'unconvincing', 'last', 'reel', 'Which', 'shame', 'much', 'admire', 'here', 'adaptation', 'Tolstoy', 'short', 'story', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'innocent', 'recipient', 'forged', 'banknote', 'most', 'part', 'terrific', 'sense', 'narrative', 'exposing', 'way', 'petty', 'crime', 'can', 'have', 'major', 'moral', 'repercussions', 'social', 'scale', 'rich', 'able', 'buy', 'lie', 'way', 'trouble', 'oh', 'performances', 'Bresson', 'made', 'career', 'soliciting', 'convincing', 'performances', 'amateurs', 'have', 'wonder', 'just', 'why', 'are', 'nearly', 'so', 'very', 'terrible', 'here', 'Not', 'only', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'give', 'even', 'vaguest', 'impression', 'life', 'intelligent', 'otherwise', 'move', 'so', 'mechanically', 'mannequin-like', 'back', 'straight', 'arms', 'down', 'sides', 'lead', 'weights', 'try', 'remember', 'hit', 'marks', 'wonder', 'Bresson', 'actually', 'intended', 'effect', 'did', 'not', 'watching', 'outtakes', 'public', 'information', 'film', 'times', 'Swedish', 'phrase', 'book', 'sketch', 'Monty', 'Python', 'A', 'couple', 'performers', 'get', 'Christian', 'Patey', 'so', 'physically', 'verbally', 'awkward', 'lead', 'painful', 'watching', 'progress', 'Wong', 'ways.Yet', '70', 'minutes', 'least', 'strength', 'narrative', 'Bresson', 'spare', 'economical', 'telling', 'lend', 'relentless', 'forward', 'momentum', 'manage', 'hold', 'Tragically', 'film', 'resolution', 'convince', 'way', 'turning', 'initially', 'fundamentally', 'decent', 'protagonist', 'money-hungry', 'thrill-killer', 'not', 'logical', 'consequence', 'experiences', 'purely', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'prove', 'point', 'provide', 'ending', 'final', 'offscreen', 'mass', 'murder', 'simply', 'tacked-on', 'sensationalism', 'especially', 'considering', 'absurd', 'set', 'circumstances', 'bosom', 'family', 'kills.A', 'good', 'film', 'ultimately', 'frustrating', 'unrewarding', 'one', 'strong', 'points']",N/A
