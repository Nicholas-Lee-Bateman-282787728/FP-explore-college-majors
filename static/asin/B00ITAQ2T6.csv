But because so much time has elapsed between the last season's release, I now only buy blu-ray.  Would give anything if the &#34;powers that be&#34; would release NYPD (the entire series) on blu-ray.  Glad to see this. Happy for those that will/can buy this.  But I won't purchase any more seasons until blu-ray is available.  Same with &#34;Elementary&#34; &#34;Longmire&#34; &#34;The Good Wife&#34; and &#34;Suits.&#34;  A new &#34;smartphone&#34; every 17 minutes (I'll never own one.

I hope they continue to release the subsequent seasons, because this remained one of the very best shows on TV, and quite possibly the very best cop show ever (&#34;Homicide:  Life on the Street&#34; might give it a run for the money for that title, though), throughout its 12-year run right to the very end.In my opinion this was the best show we could not get.

1694924,AX9ZYSNJKJJK6,B00ITAQ2T6,R. Wolfe,"[15, 16]","NYPD Blue was firing on all cylinders throughout most of its run of 12 seasons.  Season 6 was no exception.  With Jimmy Smits out of the picture, Dennis Franz took up the torch and pushed this show through 6 more seasons pretty much on his own strength, an exceptional ensemble cast, and great stories.  I'm sure some folks might look at a release of a show this old and think, &#34;Why bother?&#34;  but anyone who gives pretty much any season of NYPD Blue a shot will come away thinking, &#34;How did TV fall so far since making shows like this back in the late 90's/early 2000's?&#34;  Rick Schroeder was not highly anticipated by many fans, but turned out to be a great addition to the cast and a well-loved partner for Sipowicz.  His character was as internally tormented as Sipowicz has ever been, and the show never faltered or suffered for his inclusion despite the misgivings of a lot of folks beforehand.  In short, this season will not disappoint, and if you've been collecting them all since Season 1 came out--HOLY COW--SEASON 6 is FINALLY COMING!!!
