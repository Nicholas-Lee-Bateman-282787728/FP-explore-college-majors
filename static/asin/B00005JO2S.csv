Both Gene Wilder & Les Lye are remembered for their larger than life roles in video history.  Both Wonka & YCDTOTV created a world of imagination & escape for their cross continent viewers. They are both anchored in the hearts & minds of the children who once watched them regularly.  I, for one, still watch Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory on a regular basis.  Well, not every day, but a few times a year when I break from my diet.  I can only hope that I will be able to watch Les lye, ""Moose"", & the whole gang once again.  I know they are available on fan sites, but clarity and ease of view they are not.  I even own the entire series on a bad collection of dvd's.  Of course, I was still anxious to watch every episode.Roald Dahl created such worlds as Willy Wonka. Sid & Marty Krofft created such worlds as H.R. Pufnstuff. And, Roger Price created such worlds as You Can't Do That On Television.  Charlie & the Chocolate Factory (though closr to the book) isn't the same classic.  The new Land of the Lost movie was horrible.  Though, I am looking forward to the new (but grounded in the originals) versions of Sigmund & the Sea Monsters and Pufnstuf.

I can admit that I was a rather devoted fan back in the day.Sure, it was crude, sure the jokes were one-liners, sure it was obnoxious, campy, and the best this since Monty Python's Flying Circus.

But YCDTOT is an icon, a shining example of what every TV show today strives NOT to be: tasteless, classless, and well just plain stupid at times. But funny enough to keep you coming back for more.
