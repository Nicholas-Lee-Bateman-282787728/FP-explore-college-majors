How can something that teaches you discipline and patience and concentration not wind up being something positive?It was for these masters.  Some of them grew up in especially tough times.  Brutally attacked by a gang of racists that sent him to a hospital for months, in retaliation merely for refusing to sit at the back of the bus, one master (Ron van Clief?) in the marine corps recovered only to be sent on suicide missions by his &#34;cracker&#34; officers in Vietnam, who told them that if they couldn't get him here, the &#34;gooks&#34; would get him out there.  It took him decades, he says, to get out of survival mode enough to be able to sleep well.  Yet now he has the kind of easy smile and humility, and positive attitude, we'd all wish on ourselves when we get to his grey-crowned years.There is lots of recounting of going to Chinatown movie theaters back in the 70's to catch the kung fu movies back when nobody had even heard of kung fu or had any idea what it might be.  I'm old enough to remember those years and the incredible thrill of going into those theaters as one of the only non-Chinese there to see people move the way I might not even have been able to imagine people moving before, in villages and costumes and with weapons my whole world had no idea of.  The laughing and flirting and hooting turning the place upside down while the actors talked, only to be suddenly hushed, not one tiniest noise, when the first loud stinging slap on screen began the wrong that must be righted, the injustice that would be redeemed.  With the tiger claw, the toad punch (what?), the dragon whipping his tail.  It was amazing, enchanting, and it launched millions of dreams.This movie shows how some of those dreams played out into happiness, personal and community achievement, and success despite the immense cultural differences that had to be conquered.  In so doing, it celebrates the determination to follow even the most unusual dreams and make them real and beautiful, and reminds how long good things and good spirit can be made to grow and last.",5,It was a positive one!,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,2194,"['Black', 'Kungfu', 'Experience', 'was', 'very', 'positive', 'one', 'one', 'masters', 'natural', 'thing', 'How', 'can', 'something', 'discipline', 'patience', 'concentration', 'not', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'something', 'positive', 'was', 'masters', 'grew', 'up', 'especially', 'tough', 'times', 'Brutally', 'attacked', 'gang', 'racists', 'sent', 'hospital', 'months', 'retaliation', 'merely', 'refusing', 'sit', 'back', 'bus', 'one', 'master', 'Ron', 'van', 'Clief', 'marine', 'corps', 'recovered', 'only', 'be', 'sent', 'suicide', 'missions', '34', 'cracker', '34', 'officers', 'Vietnam', 'who', 'told', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'here', '34', 'gooks', '34', 'would', 'get', 'out', 'there', 'took', 'decades', 'get', 'survival', 'mode', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'sleep', 'well', 'Yet', 'now', 'kind', 'easy', 'smile', 'humility', 'positive', 'attitude', ""'d"", 'wish', 'when', 'get', 'grey-crowned', 'lots', 'recounting', 'going', 'Chinatown', 'movie', 'theaters', 'back', '70', 'catch', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'back', 'when', 'nobody', 'had', 'even', 'heard', 'kung', 'fu', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'might', 'be', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'years', 'incredible', 'thrill', 'going', 'theaters', 'one', 'only', 'non-Chinese', 'see', 'people', 'move', 'way', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'imagine', 'people', 'moving', 'before', 'villages', 'costumes', 'weapons', 'whole', 'world', 'had', 'idea', 'laughing', 'flirting', 'hooting', 'turning', 'place', 'upside', 'down', 'actors', 'talked', 'only', 'be', 'suddenly', 'hushed', 'not', 'one', 'tiniest', 'noise', 'when', 'first', 'loud', 'stinging', 'slap', 'screen', 'began', 'wrong', 'must', 'be', 'righted', 'injustice', 'would', 'be', 'redeemed', 'tiger', 'claw', 'toad', 'punch', 'what', 'dragon', 'whipping', 'tail', 'was', 'amazing', 'enchanting', 'launched', 'millions', 'dreams.This', 'movie', 'how', 'dreams', 'played', 'out', 'happiness', 'personal', 'community', 'achievement', 'success', 'immense', 'cultural', 'differences', 'had', 'be', 'conquered', 'so', 'doing', 'determination', 'follow', 'even', 'most', 'unusual', 'dreams', 'make', 'real', 'beautiful', 'how', 'long', 'good', 'things', 'good', 'spirit', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'grow', 'last']",Black Kungfu Experience
