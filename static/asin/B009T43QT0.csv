1601999,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B009T43QT0,blackaciddevil,"[1, 2]","In this modern retelling of the classic tale by The Brothers Grimm, two teenage siblings try to escape a psychotic recluse from within her her house in the woods.What I liked most about The Asylum's Hansel and Gretel is that they took the classic story and made it into a slasher film. I agree with Dread Central wholeheartedly, Hansel and Gretel is a pretty damned good horror movie. I'll give it that. However, as a modern retelling of the classic tale, I feel it would have been alot better if it were a period slasher film. As good as the film was, I just couldn't take it seriously...especially with the lead characters named Hansel and Gretel. How many people do you know or have you known with those names? At the moment, I'm 45 and I've never met any male or female with those names. The acting, for the most part, was fair. The story was decent and the gore was enough to satisfy any slasher fan.I'll admit, although I do support The Asylum and their movies, through the years- their films have been hit-or-miss. I'm not so quick to run out and buy every release that comes out. I do rent them, though, and make a judgement based on whether it's good enough to buy or not.  Do I think Hansel and Gretel is worthy of a purchase? Well- here's how I look at it...as a horror movie, Hansel and Gretel is pretty dadgummed good. As a modern retelling of the Grimm classic, not so much. If you can get past that- I'd get it for my collection. If not- I'd pass this one up and look for the next Asylum hit.As hard as people find it to believe, The Asylum does have a good catalog of worthy releases worth picking up...even some originals. I see a time in the forseeable future when The Asylum will be looked at as a legitimate film company(much like Full Moon Pictures) and not so much as a 'Mockbuster' maker.

I found the movie enjoyable.  The camera scenes were not too dark and the I had no problem seeing what was going on.  Dee Wallace played a good bad witch.  The other acting was questionable and no double the characters made some really bad decisions but if not for the bad decisions they wouldn't be in the position to get killed off.  There is a gore but nor any gross out type like the eyeball coming out of socket in Hostel.

With over 50 movies in the can, the production company has yet to lose money on a single feature. Often from the time a title is announced to the moment the film is available to purchase is less than six months. This is cynical filmmaking to say the least but there is something ingenious about the business side of this sort of low brow end of movies approach. Is this really anything different than what Roger Corman did in the 60s and 70s? Joe Dante's Piranha was a shameless rip off of Jaws. The Asylum's Hansel and Gretel is a shameless rip off of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. The real question to ask...does this rip off work or is it even worse than the ""blockbuster"" it is trying to capitalize on. Let's take a bite out of Hansel and Gretel.As Hansel & Gretel begins we witness an overweight girl tied up in shackles trapped in a dark and dreary basement. She manages to get herself free and she runs out of the house and into the woods only to find herself trapped yet again. An apple in the mouth and some seasonings and she has become the next meal for the family who lives in the house. After ""treated"" to the opening Saw ""homage"", I was already tuning myself out of the film. But then something strange happened. The movie developed a sense of humor about itself and it went from being a chore to sit through to becoming one of the more entertaining movies of the last few years. We have our two heroes (Hansel and Gretel, of course) on a race against time as they battle the delightfully evil Dee Wallace as the witch. But I mean Dee Wallace runs a bakery that sells meat pies called The Gingerbread House. How great is that?I'm been complaining lately that there haven't been enough good-bad horror movies lately. Horror movies that aren't exactly great but are shamelessly entertaining. The Asylum's Hansel and Gretel completely fits the bill. Not only is this Asylum's best work to date, it is also their most enjoyable work yet. A terrifically over-the-top performance by Dee Wallace who gets to shout lines like ""EAT YOUR DINNER!"" and ""I was always going to eat YOU!"" seals the deal. A must watch for slasher fans.

Der,"[0, 0]","If you seen the other B-rated movie of Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft (2013), than this movie is slightly better in every category.This movie has really no spacial effects but one or two. The rest of it is done with props and that was a much better way to go overall than trying to do cheap CGI.This movie story wasn't bad. I kind of enjoyed it. They use a similar story but added more twist to the story and I liked that they tried that compared to what I saw in the other B-rated movie.The whole casts did a much pretty job of acting in this movie than in the other B-rated movie.The directing was great for the cutting and editing of scenes. There was almost no drag and the movie moves at a fast pace like an action movie.Overall, I give this an average grade. It's not the best movie in the world, but it goes pretty far compared to the other B-rated Hansel & Gretel.",3,Better than the other B-rated Hansel & Gretel movie,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,881,"['seen', 'other', 'B-rated', 'movie', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Warriors', 'Witchcraft', '2013', 'movie', 'slightly', 'better', 'category.This', 'movie', 'really', 'spacial', 'effects', 'one', 'two', 'rest', 'done', 'props', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'go', 'overall', 'trying', 'do', 'cheap', 'CGI.This', 'movie', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'kind', 'enjoyed', 'use', 'similar', 'story', 'added', 'more', 'twist', 'story', 'liked', 'tried', 'compared', 'what', 'saw', 'other', 'B-rated', 'movie.The', 'whole', 'casts', 'did', 'much', 'pretty', 'job', 'acting', 'movie', 'other', 'B-rated', 'movie.The', 'directing', 'was', 'great', 'cutting', 'editing', 'scenes', 'was', 'almost', 'drag', 'movie', 'fast', 'pace', 'action', 'movie.Overall', 'give', 'average', 'grade', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'world', 'pretty', 'far', 'compared', 'other', 'B-rated', 'Hansel', 'Gretel']",N/A

1602020,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B009T43QT0,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[14, 17]","The story of Hansel and Gretal has been turned into a bad slasher film by the folks at Asylum. The film opens with a rather heavy set woman being baked alive. They actually stick the proverbial apple in her mouth. After the credits we move to the mountain town of Candlewood, where at the Gingerbread House, Lilith (Dee Wallace) serves up her world famous meat pie to a customer. Not too hard to figure out.Gretal Grimm (Stephanie Greco) works for Lilith, a person she has taken a shine too. After a family squabble Hansel Grimm (Brent Lydic) runs off into the nearby mystic woods, that no one has ever ventured into. Gretal chases after her brother.The film digresses into a dungeon imprisonment film complete with goons. The ageless Lilith's powers are chemical and not supernatural.The picture takes us into the action early. Not much build up. Unfortunately the rest of the film involves escape attempts and battling the captors in a very ""B"" horror/slasher type of fashion.Brent Lydic's acting was noticeably bad, as was much of the supporting cast. The script was trite.Parental Guidance: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Sara Fletcher in bra/panties. Some torture/blood. Cannibalism. 1 1/2 stars. If you are not a fan of Asylum's bad films, I would suggest you take a pass on this one.",2,WORLD FAMOUS MEAT PIE,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,1285,"['story', 'Hansel', 'Gretal', 'been', 'turned', 'bad', 'slasher', 'film', 'folks', 'Asylum', 'film', 'rather', 'heavy', 'set', 'woman', 'being', 'baked', 'alive', 'actually', 'stick', 'proverbial', 'apple', 'mouth', 'credits', 'move', 'mountain', 'town', 'Candlewood', 'where', 'Gingerbread', 'House', 'Lilith', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'up', 'world', 'famous', 'meat', 'pie', 'customer', 'Not', 'too', 'hard', 'figure', 'out.Gretal', 'Grimm', 'Stephanie', 'Greco', 'Lilith', 'person', 'taken', 'shine', 'too', 'family', 'squabble', 'Hansel', 'Grimm', 'Brent', 'Lydic', 'nearby', 'mystic', 'woods', 'one', 'ever', 'ventured', 'Gretal', 'chases', 'brother.The', 'film', 'dungeon', 'imprisonment', 'film', 'complete', 'goons', 'ageless', 'Lilith', 'powers', 'are', 'chemical', 'not', 'supernatural.The', 'picture', 'action', 'early', 'Not', 'much', 'build', 'up', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'film', 'attempts', 'battling', 'captors', 'very', 'B', 'horror/slasher', 'type', 'fashion.Brent', 'Lydic', 'acting', 'was', 'noticeably', 'bad', 'was', 'much', 'supporting', 'cast', 'script', 'was', 'trite.Parental', 'Guidance', 'F-bomb', 'No', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Sara', 'Fletcher', 'bra/panties', 'torture/blood', 'Cannibalism', '1', '1/2', 'stars', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'Asylum', 'bad', 'films', 'would', 'suggest', 'take', 'pass', 'one']",N/A
