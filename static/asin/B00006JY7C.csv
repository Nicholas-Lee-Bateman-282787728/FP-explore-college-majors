The characters were well drawn, and it gave a good overview of the marriage of George VI and his consort Elizabeth, later the queen mother.  However, the movie was too short to really do justice to all the material.  We were moved suddenly from the christening of the future Queen to the introduction of Mrs. Simpson with little notice of the intervening years. The build up to the war was rushed through, lost in the king's anguish over the division between him and his brother. And we see far too little of the princesses as they grow - Elizabeth jumps from 10 to 19 with barely a mention in between.

We almost always see this story from the perspective of Edward VIII (who abdicated so he could marry ""the woman he loved""), but we rarely see how this one very personal event shaped the history of Britain.  George VI and Queen Elizabeth had not expected to be King and Queen, yet their leadership through WWII was important to the morale of the Brits through this difficult time.  How might things have been different if they had not been the monarchs through that time?  And, of course, their daughter, Elizabeth, became Queen Elizabeth II.  The acting is superb and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  So much so that I am going to keep it and watch it again.

Vivacious Elizabeth caught the eye of Bertie soon after she ""came out"" into Society and he persued her until she agreed to become his wife. As only the second son, and never in a million years, expecting to be thrust into the spotlight, nervous stammerer Bertie and his gentle wife had foreseen a quiet future as Duke and Duchess of York, living a genteel life with their two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret Rose, but, upon the abdication of Bertie's elder brother David who renounced his title of King Edward V111, in order to marry Wallis Simpson, the family's position was changed irrevocably to that of a major position on the world stage. The family remained in London for the duration of WW2, refusing to be separated, even if it meant that they were in real danger of bombing, and were loved by the people for facing the same dangers and hardship that they did. The strain of his position for which he had never been prepared or trained, almost certainly contributed to the King's early death in 1952, leaving Queen Elizabeth now the Queen Mother and a widow for around 50 years.

719268,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,B00006JY7C,Bold Consumer,"[9, 9]","I enjoyed this movie because I love history and always wonder what life was like behind the scenes. Even though I often enjoy watching the big ceremonial scenes with the crowns, robes, and history, there is always curiosity about 'the rest' of it. This movie was about the family discussions behind the scenes, not the big ceremonial events, and while we don't know how close it comes to what really happened, I found it believable. While the story told by this movie is very much about the decision of the king to leave when the country will not accept his flawed would-be queen, we don't go through what was obviously many months of emotional and political negotiations prior to the final decision. That was only briefly treated in this presentation, and I'm glad. The more interesting part was Bertie & Elizabeth and their story apart from the battle we've all heard before.The movie starts as Bertie and Elizabeth meet, Bertie being fully devoted to his brother, the future king. Bertie seemed humble, particularly since he had a severe problem with stuttering. We get to watch as he struggles to overcome his speech difficulties, finally with success, exceptions being when he was overcome with anger or emotion. At one such time he was lashing out at his brother the king, who had given up his throne and  subsequently shown no signs of having any good character at all. Bertie finally had enough, his speech problems briefly recurring as he responded to that moment.We see a few 'party' scenes where Bertie's brother meets the woman he would give up the throne for, and believe me, they don't come off too well. This movie is not sympathetic to Edward and Mrs. Simpson, showing them to be petty, lazy, uncaring, and ignorant.In one impressive scene, Bertie and Elizabeth come to have dinner with the King and happen upon Mrs. Simpson carrying on about how common and silly Elizabeth, the current Queen Elizabeth's mother, was. She was making fun of her and even doing a demeaning imitation of her, while unknown to Mrs. Simpson, Elizabeth watched.  Elizabeth, in response to their stunned looks when they realized she was there, said effectively and with great dignity, ""We came to have dinner with the King.""  Mrs. Simpson was subsequently shunned and shut out of any family or official events.We see the differences in the brothers. Bertie showed bravery as he literally spent his life trying to save his country. On the other hand, Edward tricked Bertie into giving him money by pretending he didn't have any. When he realized that, as well as the fact that Edward & Mrs. Simpson were traveling outside the country as if they were ambassadors, befriending Hitler, etc., Bertie lost respect for his brother. He also didn't have time for his brother's demands, because he devoted long, hard hours to his war-time work, which eventually contributed to his early death. Even his mother tried to intervene when she realized he was working himself to death, but stopped herself, because she realized that he was doing his duty. Finally, Edward was allowed to attend the funeral and Mrs. Simpson was not allowed. The movie doesn't go past his death and only briefly showed how his daughter was prepared for her role as Queen.",5,Not The Big Ceremonial Events But The People Themselves - Very Intreresting!,1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,3228,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'love', 'history', 'always', 'wonder', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'scenes', 'Even', 'often', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'big', 'ceremonial', 'scenes', 'crowns', 'robes', 'history', 'always', 'curiosity', ""'the"", 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'family', 'discussions', 'scenes', 'not', 'big', 'ceremonial', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'close', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'found', 'believable', 'story', 'told', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'decision', 'king', 'leave', 'when', 'country', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'flawed', 'would-be', 'queen', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'what', 'was', 'obviously', 'many', 'months', 'emotional', 'political', 'negotiations', 'prior', 'final', 'decision', 'was', 'only', 'briefly', 'treated', 'presentation', ""'m"", 'glad', 'more', 'interesting', 'part', 'was', 'Bertie', 'Elizabeth', 'story', 'apart', 'battle', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'before.The', 'movie', 'Bertie', 'Elizabeth', 'meet', 'Bertie', 'being', 'fully', 'devoted', 'brother', 'future', 'king', 'Bertie', 'seemed', 'humble', 'particularly', 'had', 'severe', 'problem', 'stuttering', 'get', 'watch', 'overcome', 'speech', 'difficulties', 'finally', 'success', 'exceptions', 'being', 'when', 'was', 'overcome', 'anger', 'emotion', 'one', 'such', 'time', 'was', 'lashing', 'out', 'brother', 'king', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'throne', 'subsequently', 'shown', 'signs', 'having', 'good', 'character', 'Bertie', 'finally', 'had', 'enough', 'speech', 'problems', 'briefly', 'recurring', 'responded', 'moment.We', 'see', 'few', ""'party"", 'scenes', 'where', 'Bertie', 'brother', 'woman', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'throne', 'believe', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'too', 'well', 'movie', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'Edward', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'showing', 'be', 'petty', 'lazy', 'uncaring', 'ignorant.In', 'one', 'impressive', 'scene', 'Bertie', 'Elizabeth', 'come', 'have', 'dinner', 'King', 'happen', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'carrying', 'how', 'common', 'silly', 'Elizabeth', 'current', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'mother', 'was', 'was', 'making', 'fun', 'even', 'doing', 'demeaning', 'imitation', 'unknown', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'Elizabeth', 'watched', 'Elizabeth', 'response', 'stunned', 'looks', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'there', 'said', 'effectively', 'great', 'dignity', 'came', 'have', 'dinner', 'King', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'was', 'subsequently', 'shunned', 'shut', 'family', 'official', 'events.We', 'see', 'differences', 'brothers', 'Bertie', 'showed', 'bravery', 'literally', 'spent', 'life', 'trying', 'save', 'country', 'other', 'hand', 'Edward', 'tricked', 'Bertie', 'giving', 'money', 'pretending', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'When', 'realized', 'that', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'Edward', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'were', 'traveling', 'country', 'were', 'ambassadors', 'befriending', 'Hitler', 'etc.', 'Bertie', 'lost', 'respect', 'brother', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'brother', 'demands', 'devoted', 'long', 'hard', 'hours', 'war-time', 'work', 'eventually', 'contributed', 'early', 'death', 'Even', 'mother', 'tried', 'intervene', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'working', 'death', 'stopped', 'realized', 'was', 'doing', 'duty', 'Finally', 'Edward', 'was', 'allowed', 'attend', 'funeral', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'go', 'death', 'only', 'briefly', 'showed', 'how', 'daughter', 'was', 'prepared', 'role', 'Queen']",Bertie and Elizabeth

It was too short and like most papers in Britain, doesn't tell the inside story of the royals.  Certainly George VI and his wife were loved by the people largely because of their response to the events of World War II (Staying in London during the bombings and their visits to the neighborhoods and people that suffered through the bombings).  I don't think it gives enough credit to Elizabeth who seemed to be in touch with the ""common"" people as much as, or more than Diana at a later time.  It makes me curious about the depiction of her in ""The Queen"" where she seems uncaring or at times seriously opposed to Diana.This movie covers an interesting period in Britain's history and deals with characters that have been rather reclusive as concerns their private lives.

719273,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B00006JY7C,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 2]","After seeing Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush in the fine 2010 film ""The King's Speech"" and recalling that King George VI and his wife Elizabeth were once the subject of a BBC production televised on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre, I viewed ""Bertie and Elizabeth: the Reluctant Royals"" with the intention of gleaning more information about this British Monarch who led his people during the trying time of WW2.  For the most part, ""Bertie and Elizabeth"" delivers what one would expect from such a piece: a 105-minute portrait of a royal couple who as the Duke and Duchess of York expect to live the life of pomp and ceremony befitting their titles albeit without the harsh public glare of the royal spotlight reserved for the king.When Albert's brother, David (crowned as Edward VIII) abdicates his throne ""for the woman [he] loves,"" Bertie and his wife, commoner Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (the late Queen Mum to the present Elizabeth II) find themselves stunned like deer in the headlights of the public eye and the new technology of the radio broadcast utilized to bring the royals into the living rooms of their monarchy's constituency.In Tom Hooper's ""The King's Speech,"" Bertie suffers from a stutter that renders him unable to quickly and decisively engage his audiences. In this Giles Foster version--Bertie and Elizabeth meet with speech therapist Lionel Logue for an unorthodox exercise session and Logue (Michael Elwyn) accompanies the king as he makes radio broadcasts--the king's impediment although depicted as debilitating at times, is not nearly as limiting or revealing as that portrayed in the film starring Colin Firth.  The Bertie (James Wilby) of this production seems more carefree--yes, he stutters and his brother and his harem of women--Wallis Simpson (Amber Sealey) included--do immaturely poke fun at him, but he is able to take over the reigns of kingship without so much as a Freudian hiccup.  Firth's Bertie, apparently subjected to the psychological taunting of his father and older brother as he moved from childhood to adulthood, is much angrier; his frustration is palpable and presented with bursts of bad temper and studied reluctance to open up to Geoffrey Rush's Logue's paternal insights and surrogacy. The Bertie of this version is much more benign--happy with his wife, children and the ease and purpose with which he does his duty.Performances in ""Bertie and Elizabeth"" are marked by the ability of the character actors to portray world figures and not disappoint with either an over-the-top caricature or off-the mark performance.  Churchill, Chamberlain, Roosevelt, the Windsors and the little princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret all make adequate appearances.  However, none stand out remarkably, rather they interject more of the sense of happy banality that Bertie and Elizabeth (Juliet Aubrey) imbue as they cheerfully carry on, keeping it all respectable while having a bit of jolly fun behind the scenes when they aren't poster children for the cult of royal celebrity.Bottom line?  ""Bertie and Elizabeth"" ambitiously follows the life of the royal couple from their courtship in 1923 to the king's demise in 1952 from lung cancer. Nevertheless, the catastrophic world events framing their personal story, at times, steal the show and Bertie and Elizabeth are what they are, pieces on a chessboard moved about by history.  For a more psychological treatment of the portion of Bertie's life before, during and immediately after his brother Edward VIII renounced his crown for love, see the 2010 film ""The King's Speech"" for a thoroughly enjoyable entertainment.  On the other hand, ""Bertie and Elizabeth"" delightfully whiles away over 100 minutes in a less intense and compelling manner with wonderful costumes and cameo appearances by the important personage of that time.

My family and I loved King George VI.Here in brief is the story of King George V (the present Queen Elizabeth's grandfather), worrying about his two sons (King Edward VIII and King George VI); progressing to the story of the coronation/abdication of Edward VIII, and the coronation and career of King George VI (the Queen's father). The title says it all as to description/synopsis. I only wish the film had more teeth and a few more accurate facts. The excellent biography of the king by Sarah Bradford [vid. my review] is a must-have companion to this film.With the upcoming release of THE KING'S SPEECH (vid. my review), I thought it proper to review BERTIE separately for its strengths, weaknesses and overall value. The oh-so-British eternal flame James Wilby plays the beleaguered Prince Edward (""Bertie""), Duke of York, soon to be King George VI. The casting decision boggles my mind, not for any lack on Wilby's part - only that he looks nothing like the king at all.While he stutters or cowers in the background, his brother Prince Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David (""David""), Prince of Wales, King Edward VIII (a sinister-looking Charles Edwards) struts all over the place. One can see why King George continued to stammer all his life.I was moved and quite taken with Juliet Aubrey as King George's wife, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later Queen Elizabeth and ""the Queen Mum"" to the rest of the world. While bearing a good resemblance (except for her leanness), Aubrey competently and expertly inhabits the role. It is pitch perfect for me; I shudder to think of Helena Bonham-Carter starring alongside Colin Firth in SPEECH.The chameleonic Alan Bates turns in a spectacular performance as King George V, roaring and yelling all over the palaces, yet a loveable old sea dog for all that. Pity that, yet again, Bates looks nothing like the king he plays.The talent in this movie more than compensates for all the miscasting - but I wonder what it is with these producers. Only the roles of Queen Elizabeth, her daughters, and Wallis Simpson were cast with actresses who look the parts. Why not make a better effort?The immortal Eileen Adkins as Queen Mary is as impactful as she is unforgettable; I suspect a plot is afoot here, to make the average viewer fall in love with the Royal Family. While I credit the tactic, it seems like more of a ruse to those of us who know the Family on a better level. The history is also quite fudged here as part of the ploy. The wife and I often wonder what Her Majesty thinks of this film.For the above complaints I deducted one star.In any case, DO NOT lose the chance to own this splendid yet little-seen film. It is worth every bit of your attention, and is a fine work in itself. I have added THE KING'S SPEECH next to it on my shelf.",4,The Forgotten King ... but not for long now,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,3177,"['BERTIE', 'ELIZABETH', 'a/k/a', 'BERTIE', 'AND', 'ELIZABETH', 'RELUCTANT', 'ROYALS', '2002', 'was', 'originally', 'included', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'set', 'THE', 'WINDSORS', '[', 'vid', 'review', ']', 'documentary', 'covering', 'Royal', 'Family', 'reign', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'present', 'day', 'Having', 'never', 'seen', 'BERTIE', 'AND', 'ELIZABETH', 'must', 'say', 'squealed', 'delight', 'when', 'saw', 'included', 'THE', 'WINDSORS', 'family', 'loved', 'King', 'George', 'VI.Here', 'brief', 'story', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'present', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'grandfather', 'worrying', 'two', 'sons', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'progressing', 'story', 'coronation/abdication', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'coronation', 'career', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'Queen', 'father', 'title', 'description/synopsis', 'only', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'teeth', 'few', 'more', 'accurate', 'facts', 'excellent', 'biography', 'king', 'Sarah', 'Bradford', '[', 'vid', 'review', ']', 'must-have', 'companion', 'film.With', 'upcoming', 'release', 'THE', 'KING', 'SPEECH', 'vid', 'review', 'thought', 'review', 'BERTIE', 'separately', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'overall', 'value', 'oh-so-British', 'eternal', 'flame', 'James', 'Wilby', 'beleaguered', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Bertie', 'Duke', 'York', 'soon', 'be', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'casting', 'decision', 'boggles', 'mind', 'not', 'lack', 'Wilby', 'part', 'only', 'nothing', 'king', 'cowers', 'background', 'brother', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Albert', 'Christian', 'George', 'Andrew', 'Patrick', 'David', 'David', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'sinister-looking', 'Charles', 'Edwards', 'place', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'King', 'George', 'continued', 'stammer', 'life.I', 'was', 'moved', 'quite', 'taken', 'Juliet', 'Aubrey', 'King', 'George', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Bowes-Lyon', 'later', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Queen', 'Mum', 'rest', 'world', 'bearing', 'good', 'resemblance', 'leanness', 'Aubrey', 'competently', 'expertly', 'role', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'shudder', 'think', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'starring', 'alongside', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'SPEECH.The', 'chameleonic', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'roaring', 'yelling', 'palaces', 'yet', 'loveable', 'old', 'sea', 'dog', 'Pity', 'yet', 'again', 'Bates', 'nothing', 'king', 'talent', 'movie', 'more', 'compensates', 'miscasting', 'wonder', 'what', 'producers', 'Only', 'roles', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'daughters', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'were', 'cast', 'actresses', 'who', 'look', 'parts', 'Why', 'not', 'make', 'better', 'effort', 'immortal', 'Eileen', 'Adkins', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'as', 'impactful', 'unforgettable', 'suspect', 'plot', 'afoot', 'here', 'make', 'average', 'viewer', 'fall', 'love', 'Royal', 'Family', 'credit', 'tactic', 'more', 'ruse', 'who', 'know', 'Family', 'better', 'level', 'history', 'also', 'quite', 'fudged', 'here', 'part', 'ploy', 'wife', 'often', 'wonder', 'what', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'complaints', 'deducted', 'one', 'star.In', 'case', 'DO', 'NOT', 'lose', 'chance', 'own', 'splendid', 'yet', 'little-seen', 'film', 'worth', 'bit', 'attention', 'fine', 'work', 'have', 'added', 'THE', 'KING', 'SPEECH', 'shelf']",Bertie and Elizabeth

Taylor ""Marco's Realto""","[6, 6]","There is a Bible story that when the prophet Samuel went to choose the King of Israel the first candidate was a tall and impressive man. But God forbade it saying, ""Man looketh on the outward appearance but God looketh on the heart."" This went on several times until finally the King was chosen-David.The story of George VI has always reminded me of this story. King George was a shy, almost hobbit-like man who looked like he would have been happier as an accountant then a King. And yet he became one of England's most beloved Kings.This film is in some ways a subversion of the normal Hollywood ethos(perhaps, not least because it was not made in Hollywood). The hero was not the one who ""followed his bliss"". It was the decent, respectable man who followed his duty. His brother, by contrast did ""follow his bliss"" and comes off as rather a cad. ""Bertie and Elizabeth"" make normallity attractive and ""convention"" sublime. At a time when actually living the ""mere"" homely virtues of loyalty to family and country, and of decency of heart and of action could in fact be heroic.The movie shows not only the drama of history but more incongruously and yet more realistically the familiar family life. It reminds one that a happy family is still a happy family even if mommy and daddy have the highly respectable job of reigning over the world's greatest empire.The most heartwarming scene in the movie is of the royal couple touring the ruins of bomb-battered London to be greated by indomitable children waving Union Jacks.

Cofield,"[177, 180]","Bertie and Elizabeth is the story of the courtship and marriage of Prince Albert, Duke of York and second son of King George V, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.  This has historical significance in that Bertie and Elizabeth became King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in December 1936 upon the abdication of Bertie's older brother King Edward VIII, who became Duke of Windsor.  George VI and his Queen led the British monarchy through World War II and the beginning of the dissolution of the British Empire before the King died in his sleep in 1952.The first segments of this story are well done but a bit thin  in historical detail.  I would like to have seen more of the difficult relations between Bertie and his parents, and I feel personally that the character of Edward VIII was drawn to be crueler than he deserved. (While there is no doubt that the Duke of Windsor was self-absorbed, he was kinder to his siblings, particularly Bertie and his stuttering problems, than this film depicts.)  I also think Elizabeth's character comes off as superficial too much of the time, and that Wallis Simpson is made out to be far nastier than she deserves (I don't have much use for the Duchess of Windsor, but most of her missteps were out of ignorance rather than malevolence.) I enjoyed the scenes showing Elizabeth's working to help her husband overcome his stammer, though I rather doubt they really spent much time on the floor of the doctor's office.The Abdication scenes and the early years of George VI's reign are well done, particularly the Royal Visit to President Roosevelt in 1939, but things get skimpy again in the World War II years.  I don't understand why Elizabeth's famous comment that she could at last look the East End in the face after Buckingham Palace was bombed was left out. I also don't quite see the point of spending so much time focussed on Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and her wartime travails. Some of the characterizations of  generals and politicians are very well done indeed, particularly Montgomery and Churchill. (Its nice to be reminded of Churchill's sense of humor!!)  The last few segments showing the King's final years are also nice.  Queen Mary's shocked reactions are used to good effect to emphasize the advent of change in the late 1940s with the election of a Labour Government. (Clement Attlee is also very well done.) I also thought Elizabeth Dermot Walsh's portrayal of Princess Elizabeth (the present Queen) as a cool headed pragmatist extremely well done.My only real disappointment with this film is that it is  too short.  A six hour mini series would have covered the period with far more detail and historical accuracy.  But this film does reveal the humanity and courage of a King who did his duty and of the Queen who loved and supported him.

Though a royal prince hadn't married a commoner since Anne Boleyn, Bertie loved the charming and vivacious Elizabeth; they were married and had two daughters.  Theirs was a true love match and Bertie spent happy times with his family, a luxury afforded him because he would never be King, or so he thought.  Then his brother's abdication changed Bertie's life forever and he assumed the throne as King George VI.This is a sweet love story with two very likable actors in the leads.  Wilby and Aubrey are quite sympathetic and convincing as Bertie and Elizabeth and Robert Hardy is memorable in a small role as FDR. As the years pass, we see the abdication, WWII, their daughter's marriage, and a succession of Prime Ministers come and go; the one constant in their lives was their absolute devotion to each other and their personal strength and integrity.  The story ends with his death at the age of 56; his wife would outlive him for fifty years.This Masterpiece Theatre production is recommended for those who enjoy stories about the royals.

Bernabo,"[75, 80]","There was never supposed to be a Queen Elizabeth II sitting on the throne of England, anymore than there is ever supposed to be a second Queen Victoria.  When the Duke of York, the second son of King George V, married Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the first commoner to marry into English royalty since Anne Boelyn, it was not of any concern because his older brother David would inherit the throne as Edward VIII.  When the couple had their first daughter, they named her Elizabeth and I always thought it was because he wanted to honor his wife.  So when Edward VIII gave up his throne for the woman he loved, the American divorce Wallis Simpson, the Duke of York became King George VI, his wife became Queen consort, and their daughter would one day be Queen Elizabeth II.""Bertie and Elizabeth: The Reluctant Royals - The Story of King George VI & Queen Elizabeth"" begins the story right before they meet in 1920 and ends it after his death in 1952.  Of course, Elizabeth then became the ""Queen Mum"" and the most beloved woman in England and there is some indication of why in this Masterpiece Theater movie.  During the Nazi Blitz during World War II when it was suggested that the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret be taken to Canada for safety, it was the Queen consort who insisted that the family stay in London just like all of the other citizens who had no place to go.  There is some indication of the affection their subjects had for the King and Queen, but mostly the scenes are set in the castles out of the public's sight.  Of course, that is the attraction of such biopics.James Wilby (""Gosford Park"") and Juliet Aubrey (""Middlemarch"") play Bertie and Elizabeth, with Alan Bates as King George V, Eileen Atkins as Queen Mary, Charles Edwards as Edward VIII and Amber Rose Sealey as Wallis Simpson (note: the two brothers are actually named Albert and Edward although they are called Bertie and David respectively by family and friends).  This movie enhances the reputation of the title characters and they end up replacing the Duke and Duchess of Windsor as one of the great love stories of Twentieth Century.  The Prince of Wales was a playboy who lied to his family, neglected his duties, and made fun of his brother's stutter.  His future wife was a snob and when she puts down Elizabeth it is Wallis Simpson whose reputation takes a major hit.  Of course, any and all such hits are historically justified by the objective evidence regarding the infamous couple.Ultimately, this movie is a testament to how King George VI, considered a shy, dull-witted, colorless man married to a hopelessly plain wife, became heroic figures by their actions during the war.  Edward VII and Wallis Simpson were style, but George VI and Elizabeth had substance.  Even though she is another minor character in the story, the Princess Elizabeth (Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh), can still easily be seen as the product of her pragmatic parents.  Queen Mary has a couple of nice scenes, as does Winston Churchill (David Ryall), but overall this is a history light version of these interesting times.  That is because the emphasis is on the Reluctant Royals and the peculiar dynamics of the House of Windsor.  Yet, even against that troubled backdrop the simple bonds of affection between the last King of England and the woman he loved.",4,The love story of King George VI and the Queen Mum,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,3319,"['was', 'never', 'supposed', 'be', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'sitting', 'throne', 'England', 'anymore', 'ever', 'supposed', 'be', 'second', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'When', 'Duke', 'York', 'second', 'son', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'married', 'Elizabeth', 'Bowes-Lyon', 'first', 'commoner', 'marry', 'English', 'royalty', 'Anne', 'Boelyn', 'was', 'not', 'concern', 'older', 'brother', 'David', 'would', 'inherit', 'throne', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'When', 'couple', 'had', 'first', 'daughter', 'named', 'Elizabeth', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'wanted', 'honor', 'wife', 'So', 'when', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'gave', 'up', 'throne', 'woman', 'loved', 'American', 'divorce', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'Duke', 'York', 'became', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'wife', 'became', 'Queen', 'consort', 'daughter', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Bertie', 'Elizabeth', 'Reluctant', 'Royals', 'Story', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'story', 'right', 'meet', '1920', 'death', '1952', 'course', 'Elizabeth', 'then', 'became', 'Queen', 'Mum', 'most', 'beloved', 'woman', 'England', 'indication', 'why', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'movie', 'Nazi', 'Blitz', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'when', 'was', 'suggested', 'Princesses', 'Elizabeth', 'Margaret', 'be', 'taken', 'Canada', 'safety', 'was', 'Queen', 'consort', 'who', 'insisted', 'family', 'stay', 'London', 'just', 'other', 'citizens', 'who', 'had', 'place', 'go', 'indication', 'affection', 'subjects', 'had', 'King', 'Queen', 'mostly', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'castles', 'public', 'sight', 'course', 'attraction', 'such', 'biopics.James', 'Wilby', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Juliet', 'Aubrey', 'Middlemarch', 'play', 'Bertie', 'Elizabeth', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'Charles', 'Edwards', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'Amber', 'Rose', 'Sealey', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'note', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'actually', 'named', 'Albert', 'Edward', 'are', 'called', 'Bertie', 'David', 'respectively', 'family', 'friends', 'movie', 'reputation', 'title', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'replacing', 'Duke', 'Duchess', 'Windsor', 'one', 'great', 'love', 'stories', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'was', 'playboy', 'who', 'lied', 'family', 'neglected', 'duties', 'made', 'fun', 'brother', 'stutter', 'future', 'wife', 'was', 'snob', 'when', 'down', 'Elizabeth', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'reputation', 'major', 'hit', 'course', 'such', 'hits', 'are', 'historically', 'justified', 'objective', 'evidence', 'regarding', 'infamous', 'couple.Ultimately', 'movie', 'testament', 'how', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'considered', 'shy', 'dull-witted', 'colorless', 'man', 'married', 'hopelessly', 'plain', 'wife', 'became', 'heroic', 'figures', 'actions', 'war', 'Edward', 'VII', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'were', 'style', 'George', 'VI', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'substance', 'Even', 'minor', 'character', 'story', 'Princess', 'Elizabeth', 'Elisabeth', 'Dermot-Walsh', 'can', 'still', 'easily', 'be', 'seen', 'product', 'pragmatic', 'parents', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'couple', 'nice', 'scenes', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'David', 'Ryall', 'overall', 'history', 'light', 'version', 'interesting', 'times', 'emphasis', 'Reluctant', 'Royals', 'peculiar', 'dynamics', 'House', 'Windsor', 'even', 'troubled', 'backdrop', 'simple', 'bonds', 'affection', 'last', 'King', 'England', 'woman', 'loved']",Bertie and Elizabeth

Covering three decades of some of the most dramatic events in English history in less than two hours, ""Bertie and Elizabeth"" naturally feels thinner than ""The King's Speech,"" which concentrates on Bertie's relationship with Lionel Logue. (Logue is only a minor character in ""Bertie and Elizabeth."") The lower budget doesn't help; neither does the performance of Juliet Aubrey as Elizabeth, which is weak compared with that of Helena Bonham Carter in ""The King's Speech."" But James Wilby, an underrated actor best known for his starring role in ""Maurice,"" is every bit the equal of Colin Firth as Bertie. Wilby's performance is right on target, playing Bertie as a man of honor and deep feeling, frustrated both by his own weaknesses and the treachery of others.Speaking of treachery...if you're a fan of the Duke of Windsor, ""Bertie and Elizabeth"" isn't for you. ""Bertie and Elizabeth"" goes even further than ""The King's Speech"" in condemning the erstwhile Edward VIII, with Charles Edwards portraying him as a selfish, perfidious, Nazi-loving creep who never misses a chance to stick it to Bertie. It's up to you to judge the fairness of this portrayal, though there seems little question that Bertie was a substantially better man than his elder brother. Meanwhile, David Ryall makes a better Churchill here than Timothy Spall in ""The King's Speech;"" also, Alan Bates and Eileen Atkins make a stronger impression as George V and Queen Mary than Michael Gambon and Claire Bloom.

It was on PBS, which alone betokened quality.  As a person who had read, amongst other books on Royalty, the excellent memoir, ""The Little Princesses"", by Marion Crawford, governess to both Princess Elizabeth, (now Queen) Elizabeth II, and her elfin, enchanting, extremely talented, and, in the end, tragic sister, Princess Margaret (Rose), and who, in the course of her historic manuscript, had also touched on the characters and personalities of the girls' parents, (the ""Bertie and Elizabeth"" of the title of this TV-movie), and other people -- both royalty, and fellow members of the Duke & Duchessn of York's Household -- I was excited to see, not only Ms. Crawford's book brought partially to life, but also. hopefully, some other books on the English Royalty, which I had also read, also brought to life as well.Although the music, and the settings were first rate, the dialogue and story line were highly disappointing.  I'll be the first toadmit I don't know everything about the Royal family, or""Bertie and Elizabeth"" at that time -- but I DO know that Prince Albert, (the ""Bertie"" of the title -- and later, George VI), proposed to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon THREE times before she accepted.  The official line is that she was very wary of taking on royal responsibilities, though some say that she was more drawn to Prince Edward, (later the Duke of Windsor), who was first in line for the throne, rather than Bertie, who was only second.  Whatever the reasons, it IS documented that ""Bertie"", (Prince Albert), had to propose THREE times before Elizabeth said, ""Yes"".  In this TV-drama, however, this important, (and very dramatic!), detail was totally left out!  Instead of creating the circumstances where Elizabeth, perhaps, said, ""I must think of this"", the first time, and ""the idea of such responsibility is devastating"", the second....all the while making poor Prince Albert beside himself with anxiety, (he loved this girl, after all), and, perhaps, fury, (being a Prince, he was not used to being refused!) -- situations adding mightily to suspense and drama in the story -- Elizabeth, here, simply says, ""Yes!"" the first time, and Bertie, (Prince Albert), is shown to be beside himself with joy.  Such exhibiton of emotion as is shown by Bertie here is NOT usual with Royalty -- especially English royalty -- and yet not only was the emotion shown, but the unusualness of this emotion coming out, was NOT!Prince Albert had a pronounced stammer during his early years. This came from his very, very strict upbringing -- which included the wearing of heavy leg braces as a child, to correct knock-knees.  He and his siblings also had their lessons in a very large and dark school-room in the palace.  One of the most moving parts of ""The Little Princesses"", for me, was Ms. Crawford's telling of the then-new king, looking for a room in which his daughters would have as THEIR school-room.  He looked into his own, old, dark, and cavernous schoolroom for a moment, then shutting the door, said quietly, ""No, not here....""  This dramatic and memorable moment, which told much of the King's character -- along with his heroic and eventually successful over-coming of his stammer -- were, neither of them, explored in this TV movie.Yes, the great reluctance of Bertie and Elizabeth to become King and Queen IS shown.  What is NOT shown are things like the plan of Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, (which is discuszed in ""The Little Princesses""), to perhaps build a tunnel between Buckingham Palace and 145 Picadilly, (the official residence of the heretofore Duke and Duchess of York), so they could visit it on occassion, (a plan never fulfulled), or the very HUGENESS of Buckingham Palace -- which necessitated some servants using roller-skates to get around!  (And the mice(!) that lived in the Palace before modernization took place!)And although the air-raids of World War II were shown, along with the ""royal refugees"" of European countries who took shelter in Buckingham Palace -- the delightful ""pantomimes"" presented by the Princesses and other junior members of the aristocracy, to raise money for the war effort, which took place at Windsor Castle, were not shown at all....or even mentioned!I read, in ""The Little Princesses"", that Prince Albert -- like the much later American footballer, Rosie Greer -- enjoyed doing the earstwhile feminine pastime of needlepoint.  But Prince Albert found that doing backgrounds in needlepoint was boring....and so he gave over doing background needlepoint stitching to the children's governess, Marion Crawford.  These facts -- which might have started men doing needlepoint, (as they now use scent -- a definite ""no-no"" only a few decades back), and, perhaps, giving a nice little rise in sales of English needlepoint accessories -- was not shown either!Talk about missing dramatic moments in the script!A few good and telling moments were, however, thankfully shown.Yes, Mrs. Simpson is shown here -- and she does try to put poor Elizabeth down a few pegs -- but the inherent dignity of the best of the aristocracy, when meeting the very worst of American vulgarity, shines brightly and quietly triumphs. (As an American, however, I do wish a NON-vulgar American was also a character in this drama.)Princess Margaret is shown to be disappointed in her ""second"" role.Bertie wisely tells her that ""being second isn't all that bad"" -- but Princess Margaret's talents for mimicry and music, are never shown.  Other royal characters -- such as Queen Mary and King George V -- are hardly shown at all.  Also missing, (entirely), are Elizabeth's parents, the Earl and Countess of Strathmore, and the children's Nanny -- the redoubtable and, (to readers of ""The Little Princesses""), truly unforgettable ""Alah"".With so many gaps, and so many really dramatic incidents left out,anyone with even a little more knowledge than most people have, of the English Royal Family in the 1930s and 1940s, is to be greatly disappointed in this ""skimming-the-high-points-and-leaving-many-out"", version of Bertie and Elizabeth's lives.  Like someone who has ""read the book"", but is truly disappointed in the movie, I must give this historical drama only two stars.  One star would mean ""I hate it"", and, well -- with it's period costuming, regal sets, good music, and actors who TRY hard to become their characters -- I can't exactly do that.  Two stars means ""I don't like it"", and, sadly, that is what my final opinion of this TV-Movie must be.  So many dramatic details which could easily have been put in, were inexplicably left out.  So many characters which could have been explored, and/or more fully explored, were also missing.  It's too bad that more was not made of this royal, dramatic, and fascinating time in English history.  I suppose I'll just have to wait until the next screen re=telling of this story, and hope that more of the salient, and truly fascinating details, will be in this next, hopefully quite-soon-to-be-presented, version.",2,W A N T E D......T O.....S E E.....M O R E.....D E T A I L S,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,7110,"['Anglophile', 'Royalophile', 'had', 'looked', 'forward',

(After all, we Royal-watchers may think we know them, but we really don't.)  It's a very compelling situation, enhanced by the depiction of Bertie and Elizabeth's relationship as a true love match.  Edward VIII and Wallis are portrayed as rather shallow and vapid individuals.  At the end there is a coda by Russell Baker who explains that Edward has been villainized in the minds of his subjects who felt that he deserted his country, and his portrayal is consistent with his image in the minds of the British people.It is true that the brothers' complicated relationship with their parents is not a major focus in this movie.  The focus is much more on the new King and Queen and their daughters, their cosy family life and obvious devotion to each other.  If it seems a little sugar-coated, it is still quite convincing.The best part of this movie is the portrayal of Elizabeth the Queen Mother by Juliet Aubrey.

719310,A13STKDYQO5DQ8,B00006JY7C,"S. Hebbron ""S B H.""","[42, 59]","This Film tells the story of the current Queen Elizabeth's parents. Many remember well her late Mother who died very recently aged 101, her Faher is remembered for taking over the role of King from his wayward Brother who abdicated in order to marry Wallace Simpson (the divorced American, shock horror!) It plays the couple as blissfully happy young people, madly in love and not interested in royal life.It plays the Queen Mother as a sweet girl, badly treated by the nasty Mrs Simpson.It places all the major historical events in context, the abdication, WW2, the birth of Princess Elizabeth (now the Queen) and Princess Margaret (the Queen's late Sister).I'm just not sure it is as truthful as it could be, King George had a very bad stammer and was highly anxious of public speaking, he was damaged by the cruel treatment of his Father and no doubt by years at Public School; not one jot of that information is played out here. In contrast, many historians suggest that Lady Elizabeth Bowes Lyon, or the Queen Mother as she later was, was quite keen to not persue nor accept King George, preferring his Brother who later abdicated.The reported poor relationship between she and Mrs Simpson (later the Duchess of Windsor) was 2 way street, the Duchess reportedly teased the Queen Mother about her robust figure and was aware of her jealously of her, and it was generally reported the Queen Mother treated the Duchess with comtempt and like a cheap harlot. Again the film glosses over this, maybe the makers had to be careful to keep lawyers off their back, this was screened in Britian just after the Queen Mother's death so it may help to explain it's historical engineering work and the general feeling that you are viewing a J M Barrie adaptaion, I was waiting throughout for Peter Pan to appear!; it really was that fancifull at times.Not great but worth a look, the central actors are pretty wet and unconvincing too but that seems to be a script fault.",3,A raher sugary telling of history.,1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,1962,"['Film', 'story', 'current', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'parents', 'Many', 'remember', 'well', 'late', 'Mother', 'who', 'died', 'very', 'recently', 'aged', '101', 'Faher', 'remembered', 'taking', 'over', 'role', 'King', 'wayward', 'Brother', 'who', 'abdicated', 'order', 'marry', 'Wallace', 'Simpson', 'divorced', 'American', 'shock', 'horror', 'couple', 'blissfully', 'happy', 'young', 'people', 'madly', 'love', 'not', 'interested', 'royal', 'life.It', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'sweet', 'girl', 'badly', 'treated', 'nasty', 'Mrs', 'Simpson.It', 'major', 'historical', 'events', 'context', 'abdication', 'WW2', 'birth', 'Princess', 'Elizabeth', 'now', 'Queen', 'Princess', 'Margaret', 'Queen', 'late', 'Sister', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'as', 'truthful', 'could', 'be', 'King', 'George', 'had', 'very', 'bad', 'stammer', 'was', 'highly', 'anxious', 'public', 'speaking', 'was', 'damaged', 'cruel', 'treatment', 'Father', 'doubt', 'years', 'Public', 'School', 'not', 'one', 'jot', 'information', 'played', 'out', 'here', 'contrast', 'many', 'historians', 'suggest', 'Lady', 'Elizabeth', 'Bowes', 'Lyon', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'later', 'was', 'was', 'quite', 'keen', 'not', 'persue', 'accept', 'King', 'George', 'preferring', 'Brother', 'who', 'later', 'abdicated.The', 'reported', 'poor', 'relationship', 'Mrs', 'Simpson', 'later', 'Duchess', 'Windsor', 'was', '2', 'way', 'street', 'Duchess', 'reportedly', 'teased', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'robust', 'figure', 'was', 'aware', 'jealously', 'her', 'was', 'generally', 'reported', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'treated', 'Duchess', 'comtempt', 'cheap', 'harlot', 'Again', 'film', 'maybe', 'makers', 'had', 'be', 'careful', 'keep', 'lawyers', 'off', 'back', 'was', 'screened', 'Britian', 'just', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'death', 'may', 'help', 'explain', 'historical', 'engineering', 'work', 'general', 'feeling', 'are', 'viewing', 'J', 'M', 'Barrie', 'adaptaion', 'was', 'waiting', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'appear', 'really', 'was', 'fancifull', 'times.Not', 'great', 'look', 'central', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'wet', 'unconvincing', 'too', 'be', 'script', 'fault']",Bertie and Elizabeth
