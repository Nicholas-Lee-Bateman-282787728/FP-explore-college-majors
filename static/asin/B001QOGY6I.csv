G-Force is a team of special agents consisting of three guinea pigs and a mole. Make that four guinea pigs, as they pick one up in a pet store along the way.Ben and Marcy are the humans who trained them, and apparently developed their highly specialized equipment, but the story really belongs to Darwin, Blaster, Juarez and Speckles, and their tag-along Hurley. The action is terribly fast-paced, sometimes too much so for me, and amazingly inventive.Saber (Bill Nighy) is the head of a multinational appliance company that has imbedded communication chips into every one of its appliances, and plans to turn them all into a global spy ring in an operation with a code name I can't remember.This is a totally high-tech movie, with lots of 3-D displays and crawling around inside sophisticated hardware, and a good bit of computer jargon I only partly understood, but the general point is that the real computer nerd is Speckles. Remember, he's a mole. Make of that what you will.There are also a few FBI agents who are trying to shut down the G-Force, mostly because they don't believe the project has justified its budget. And there's a great reconnaissance fly, which gives Ben a chance to inquire if the fly is OK, and when he gets an affirmative answer, says, ""I don't like it when my fly is down.""Yes, it's that kind of humor, including some rather remarkable fart jokes. Also, when Juarez (a female) is bought for a silly little girl's pet, and she's all decked out like a Barbie doll, make note of how she describes herself when looking in a mirror. You may have to watch it more than once to catch all the great puns and sly references.Good fun for grownups and older children, but perhaps a little confusing for rather little kids.

1231350,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001QOGY6I,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 6]","If you're over the age of ten, you're officially too old for ""G-Force.""  This is an innocent, non-threatening action and special effects extravaganza. It's not meant to inspire, educate, enlighten, or encourage; it's mindless escapism for the little ones, and nothing more. Knowing this, I find myself in a strange situation, torn between recognizing the entertainment value and the reality that it's the cinematic equivalent of empty calories. From my world-weary adult's perspective, I watched this movie caring not a bit for the characters or the story, and I kept wondering why no one considered the idea that even kids can enjoy something more stimulating. I can't think of any part of the brain this movie stimulates, except, maybe, for the visual areas easily distracted by eye candy. The tagline says it all: ""Gadgets, gizmos, guinea pigs. In 3-D.""Simple, honest, and direct. To be sure, there are a lot of cool visuals, and the fact that certain theaters are showing the film in 3-D is sure to be alluring for some kids. The technical work that went into this movie is extraordinary. It was, after all, directed by Hoyt Yeatman, who started in the film industry in visual effects departments. It was also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, whose supervision of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy, the ""National Treasure"" films, ""Armageddon,"" and ""The Rock"" proves that he has an affinity for action and special effects. What is he trying to say with ""G-Force""? That within all of us is a child who likes gadgets, gizmos, and guinea pigs all in the same story?The premise is light-hearted, if completely uninspired. A technical expert named Ben (Zach Galifianakis) has trained three guinea pigs, a mole, and a fly to be secret agents. The guinea pigs are Darwin (voiced by Sam Rockwell), Juarez (voiced by Pen&eacute;lope Cruz), and Blaster (voiced by Tracy Morgan). The mole is Speckles (voiced by an unrecognizable Nicholas Cage). The fly is Mooch, who serves mostly as surveillance. They're all equipped with tiny electronic devices you're not supposed to question the plausibility of, such as night-vision goggles, PDAs, handheld blowtorches, parachutes, laptops, and earpieces for communication. Hoping to impress the FBI and become their own special task force, they're assigned to infiltrate the home of a powerful billionaire named Leonard Saber (Bill Nighy), who plots to take over the world with his line of household appliances.Joining the adventure at one point or another are a flatulent guinea pig named Hurley (voiced by Jon Favreau) and a temperamental hamster named Bucky (voiced by Steve Buscemi). Hurley clings to Darwin like someone in desperate need of a friend and is always hungry. There's a reason for this, but I don't think it matters one way or the other.At a certain point, Blaster decides to call his team G-Force, although he never says what the G stands for. Is it safe to assume that it means Guinea Pig? No, that would be GP-Force. Anyway, as they attempt to stop Saber, they're pursued by an FBI team led by Agent Kip Killian (Will Arnet), who feels that talking guinea pigs will compromise their own mission to stop Saber. This eventually leads to a frenetic chase sequence involving squad cars and highly mechanized plastic hamster balls; they zoom around the street of Los Angeles until they go right through an active fireworks display. In the annals of movie car chase sequences, I tend to doubt that any audience member, child or adult, sat in the theater and thought, ""This would be so much better with fireworks!""I won't say any more about the general plot, except that the final act could have gone by the title ""Transformers, Jr."" Needless to say, that's when the special effects really let loose. It's all in good fun, I guess, although I have a feeling that some will leave the theater with ringing ears and a headache. What's the point of assault the senses when an interesting story isn't even being told? How entertaining can it be if we can't even care about what's happening? There I go again, thinking like an adult.I beg you, please no comments that this is just a kid's movie, that I should lighten up, that not every movie is meant to be deep and meaningful. I've already admitted that it wasn't made for grownups. I'm sure the little ones will find it very entertaining in spite of the fact that it did absolutely nothing for me. It's an action adventure that keeps it clean, not just with the lack of violence and language but also with the belief in goodness and redemption. The closest this movie gets to a suggestive moment is a shot of Juarez shaking herself dry after emerging from a pool. Oh, you sexy guinea pig! No wonder the film couldn't get away with a G rating. I will not say that I disliked ""G-Force"" because dislike implies that I actually felt something. I watched it in an apathetic daze. Intellectually, I understood that it was made purely for entertainment. Emotionally, I continue to hope that some children prefer more fulfilling ways to spend a day at the movies.",3,Secret Agent Rodents,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,5051,"[""'re"", 'age', 'ten',

The biggest producer in Hollywood, and probably the only one of his trade known by name, has brought us another hit.G-Force is tons of fun for kids and parents alike. It has the visual spark and humor that youngsters will enjoy, and a very innovative plot that adults will marvel over. Best of all, it's clean enough for the whole family.If you've read one or two of my reviews, then you are probably familiar with my distaste for computer graphics being abused. The friendly rodents in G-Force are prime examples of computer generated images (CGI) put to their best use. These are characters worthy of CGI animation, rather than puppets or mechanical props.Sam Rockwell leads a team of genetically altered guinea-pigs as the voice of Darwin. Penelope Cruz is Juarez, Tracy Morgan is Blaster and Nicolas Cage is hilarious as a mole named Speckles. It's tough, but if you listen closely you can hear Cage's voice in there somewhere.Zach Galifianakis plays a governmental scientist named Ben. It was a shocker to see him here, I'll admit, but he's brilliant and plays his character straight.Ben is in charge of a secret government program known as `G-Force.' He has personally trained these three guinea-pigs and Speckles in the art of secret spy tactics. When `G-Force' isn't being taken seriously by officials, Ben executes an unauthorized mission to show them what `G-Force' is capable of.The team discovers that nasty criminal lord Leonard Saber (Bill Nighy) has plans for world domination via a dangerous weapon. `Leonard Saber', now that's a name for a villain! They quickly take action to uncover his secret, but somehow their incriminating data has been erased. Now they face the threat of being shut down completely.Before Ben's supervisors are able to capture the little fury clan, they outsmart them with some wild trickery and escape. Working together, they must find a way to fold Saber's evil plot, before the whole world falls victim to his madness.On their journey they meet up with a few other cuddly characters voiced by Jon Favreau and Steve Buscemi.

1231357,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001QOGY6I,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 7]","What happens when you take a secret government program of trained animals and combine them with the latest in high-tech spy equipment? The result is G-FORCE.The film became the first 3D film on the big screen by producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""National Treasure"" films, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, ""The Rock, ""Con Air"" and ""Top Gun"") who teams up once again with Academy Award-winning visual effects master Hoyt H. Yeatman (""The Abyss"", ""Mighty Joe Young"", ""The Rock"" and ""Con Air"") who directs the film.The film about animals saving the world didn't go to well with the critics but at the box office, ""G-Force"" was quite successful as the film which was budgeted at $82.5 million made over $281 million worldwide.Featuring an all-star cast, ""G-FORCE"" revolves around a secret US Government program using guinea pigs Darwin (voice by Sam Rockwell) as the squad leader, Blaster (voice of Tracy Morgan) as the outrageous weapons expert with attitude and Juarez (voice of Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) as the sexy martial arts pro and taking part in top secret espionage missions.Joining the guinea pigs is star-nosed mole, Speckles (voice of Nicolas Cage), the computer and information specialist, the computer and information specialist and Mooch, the reconnaissance expert.  Also, featuring pet shop layabout Hurley (voice by Jon Favreau) and territorial hamster Bucky (voice of Steve Buscemi).The film also stars Bill Nighy as the sinister industrialist Leonard Saber, Will Arnett as Special Agent Kip Killian who is bent on shutting down G-FORCE, Zach Galifianakis as the creator and father figure of G-FORCE, Kelli Garner as the team's veterinarian and many more.The ""G-Force"" Blu-ray release comes with the Blu-ray, a DVD and a digital copy.VIDEO & AUDIO:""G-Force"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The actual merging of CG animation and real characters actually works extremely well for this film.  Sony Pictures ImageWorks did a wonderful job on the CG and special effects.  A lot of good ideas were implemented in the film in terms of the animation of the G-Force team.  Especially hair effects as you can see the detail of the animals when they are wet or dry.  As usual with Disney releases on Blu-ray, picture quality is fantastic.  Along with the details of the G-Force team, their surroundings are detailed and when outdoors, the colors are vibrant.  Blacks are nice and deep and I spotted no problems with artifacting, banding at all.Audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit) and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. Lossless audio is actually pretty well done.  Good utilization of the rear channels for the action scenes, as explosions and glass shattering comes out quite clear from the surround channels.  ""G-Force"" tends to use quite a bit of music from the Black Eyed Peas, Lady GaGa and Flo Rida, so the music is quite clear and contains quite a bit of bass.  Subwoofer tends to utilize the bass of the music quite a bit.  But overall, a solid lossless audio track.As for the voice acting, I felt the talent did a good job.  Nicolas Cage really surprised me with his squeaky, nerdy voice for  tech master Speckles.  Penelope Cruz as the voice of female guinea pig Juarez worked quite well.  Although, Tracy Morgan sounds like Tracy Morgan but overall, the voice talent did a good job.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""G-Force"" contains several special features in 1080p or 1080i, English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital and with English SDH, French or Spanish subtitles:* Cine-Explore with Darwin, Blaster and their Creator - While watching the film, you can watch along with Darwin, Blaster and Directory Hoyt Yeatman.  As you watch, the movie will pause when a video comes up, showing behind-the-scenes of the film.  Unlike previous Blu-ray releases where the picture is picture-in-picture, Cine-Explore features the film in a stylized window while other G-Force related footage or facts are being shown on screen.  Very cool feature!* Blaster's Boot Camp -  (4:41) A featurette with Blaster (voiced by Tracy Morgan) explaining the training that one must do in order to become part of G-Force.* G-Force Mastermind- (4:13) Director Hoyt H. Yeatman talking about how the concept came from his five-year-old son.  Young Hoyt talks about how the idea came about and his experience of working on the film.* Bruckheimer Animated -(3:12) A featurette about Jerry Bruckheimer's involvement in CG work for past films.  Featuring Jerrry Bruckheimer and Hoyt Yeatman and how the two worked together in ""Armageddon"", ""Con Air"", etc. and past films that Bruckheimer utilized animation and technology.* Access Granted: Inside the Animation Lab - (7:51) Utilizing Sony Pictures ImageWorks to do the animation and special effects for the film.  A tour is given by Hoyt Yeatman of the headquarters and showing how various parts of animation were created (lighting, hair, etc.).* G-Farce Bloopers - (1:49) Bloopers from ""G-Force"".* Deleted Scenes -(6:18) A total of six deleted scenes: March of the Cockroach, Mooch's Donut Regiment, B-B-Bunies, Undercover Pets, Hurley Under Attack, World Domination.* Music Videos - Featuring three music videos: ""Jump"" by Flo Rida feat. Nelly Furtado, ""Ready to Rock"" by Steve Rushton and ""Go Go-Force"".* Learn How to Take Your Favorite Movies on the Go - (1:04) A promo trailer for DisneyFile Digital Copy.JUDGMENT CALL:""G-Force"" may not have been a popular film among the critics but for a family film, ""G-Force"" was actually fun.  The idea of ""G-Force"" came from Hoyt H. Yeatman's five year old son at the time about wanting to use his animals to take on bad guys.  And it's an idea that visual master Yeatman toiled around his head and six years later, became a feature film.Special effects were done quite well and there are many big budget films where CG animation and real-life filmmaking just doesn't work but for ""G-Force"", it worked quite well (especially if it costs over $80 million to make, it better work well).Parents may wonder why the film has a PG rating and there is mild action with the team trying to take on Saber's ""weapons"" but in terms of the rude humor, there is a lot of farting (courtesy of the gassy guinea pig Hurley) and scenes where the rodents are stuck in a sphere and you hear jokes such as ""get your butt out of my face.  No, you get your face out of my butt"" type of jokes but that is the worst it gets.  Now of course, there are scenes where a child puts one of the G-Force team members in a remote control car and crashes it into G.I. Joe action figures or tries to jump a ramp with it inside the car.  And another scene where a girl plays dress up with the guinea pig and puts nail polish and lipstick on the animal.  Of course, parents who have children with hamsters or guinea pigs will best explain to them not to do that at home despite seeing it onscreen.As far as the Blu-ray release is concerned, you get a solid 3-disc release (Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy) and plenty of special features to keep the children busy during this holiday season.  The ""Cine-Explore"" feature was especially well-utilized on this Blu-ray release.In the end, this film is a enjoyable, action-packed family film targeted for the children.  I've read many reviews by critics who just have a disdain of rodents saving the world via technology and look at it as a stupid concept.  Granted, for some of those reviewers, I'm sure when they were children, the concept of Lassie, Flipper and Benji were probably regarded by critics of their time as a bit over-the-top as well.  Granted, those animals were not hooked up to high tech devices and were used to save the world but granted, this is not the film to exactly take seriously.  The same happened with the release of ""Stuart Little"" back in 1999 and critics had a hard time moving past the talking rodent but sure enough, that film inspired sequels and direct-to-DVD movies and was quite successful.Overall, I felt it ""G-Force"" was a fun concept.  Where ""Stuart Little"" was more of a happy film about family, ""G-Force"" was about camaraderie and trying to save the world.  Sure, the concept is farfetched but if you're taking this film that seriously, you're not going to enjoy this film at all.  I watched it along with my six-year-old and we both enjoyed it.  And as a parent, I felt it was a fun film with action, hijinks and a lot of music from The Black Eyed Peas.Definitely a family film  and a Blu-ray release worth checking out!",4,"Blu-ray: ""G-Force""

Clearly I was watching too many weird Betty Boop cartoons in which everything is alive and sometimes creepy.Anyway, I bring this dark secret to light because in G-Force, a coffee machine -- which normally is something I like and admire -- becomes a terrifying creature. Fortunately, the hamsters save the day. Whew!We live in a wondrous age where computers can make it seem like cute hamsters can conquer evil and do it with some attitude. G-Force is clearly a franchise in the making, aimed squarely at popcorn-munching kids. My ten-year-old thought it was just fine.While Nicolas Cage worked on his finances by providing the voice of a mole and other celebrities also voiced various critters, including Penelope Cruz, Jon Favreau, Sam Rockwell and Steve Buscemi, this was Tracy Morgan's show all the way. And speaking of shows, hearing his performance put me very much in the mind of Saturday Morning TV shows of the 1970's. Morgan would be right at home doing voices for Hanna-Barbera, Filmation or Sid & Marty Krofft. When Hong Kong Phooey is inevitably made into a big-budget theatrical movie, look no further for the lead role.Okay, I'm done being snarky. G-Force is a solid kid's adventure that's perfect for weekend afternoons. And it's not slapped together thoughtlessly, either. There is an interesting audio commentary from director Hoyt H. Yeatman, Jr. , a special effects veteran whose career includes Star Trek The Motion Picture, E.T. and Close Encounters. His comments can get pretty techie, too, when he mentions equipment by name and model number.The Blu-Ray/DVD combo includes the commentary, deleted scenes, ""bloopers,"" ""Blaster's Boot Camp"" and ""G-Force Mastermind: The Inspiration Behind the Movie,"" there are three features that can only be accessed on the Blu_Ray, which is packaged with the DVD and a digital copy in the ""Best Value"" set.",3,GEE-WHIZ!

1231367,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B001QOGY6I,G. Teslovich,"[7, 11]","Animal animation movies need several key elements to be noteworthy - ""G-Force"" struck out on all of them.(1.) First, voices are important to feel that the animated animal characters are alive so you need to choose actors with voices that enhance their character. These rodents voices were bland, unemotional and failed to convey the soul of each rodent. And the content of each voice is the script which was simplistic, sophomoric and cliche ridden.(2.) Second, we need a creative, thoughtful and believable well-constructed story. ""G-Force"" was just another ethnic stereotype of animals chasing and being chased by bad guys out to destroy the world with the laughable (as in dumb) tools of toasters and other household appliances turning into walking killing machines along with satellite debris being forced (somehow) to crash into Earth. I should point out to the less than literate writers that 90% of the debris is small stuff that will burn up in the atmosphere and the rest, if able to survive burning up, would have no impact on the future of our planet.(3.) Third, animations have evolved in the last decade to become artful creations in themselves. Disney is still churning out the cheap off the shelf animations that cost little to make but produce a nice monetary return for this studio's meager efforts.  The graphics were so bad they had to rely on the now time worn formula of dated hip-hop dancing, singing animals to give the movie some entertainment value.",1,G-Force Needs It's Cage Cleaned,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,1474,"['Animal', 'animation', 'movies', 'need', 'several', 'key', 'elements', 'be', 'noteworthy', 'G-Force', 'struck', 'out', 'them.', '1', 'First', 'voices', 'are', 'important', 'feel', 'animated', 'animal', 'characters', 'are', 'alive', 'need', 'choose', 'actors', 'voices', 'enhance', 'character', 'rodents', 'voices', 'were', 'bland', 'unemotional', 'failed', 'convey', 'soul', 'rodent', 'content', 'voice', 'script', 'was', 'simplistic', 'sophomoric', 'cliche', 'ridden.', '2', 'Second', 'need', 'creative', 'thoughtful', 'believable', 'well-constructed', 'story', 'G-Force', 'was', 'just', 'ethnic', 'stereotype', 'animals', 'chasing', 'being', 'chased', 'bad', 'guys', 'out', 'destroy', 'world', 'laughable', 'dumb', 'tools', 'toasters', 'other', 'household', 'appliances', 'turning', 'walking', 'killing', 'machines', 'satellite', 'debris', 'being', 'forced', 'somehow', 'crash', 'Earth', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'less', 'literate', 'writers', '90', '%', 'debris', 'small', 'stuff', 'will', 'burn', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'rest', 'able', 'survive', 'burning', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'impact', 'future', 'planet.', '3', 'Third', 'animations', 'have', 'evolved', 'last', 'decade', 'become', 'artful', 'creations', 'Disney', 'still', 'churning', 'out', 'cheap', 'shelf', 'animations', 'cost', 'little', 'make', 'produce', 'nice', 'monetary', 'return', 'studio', 'meager', 'efforts', 'graphics', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'rely', 'now', 'time', 'worn', 'formula', 'dated', 'hip-hop', 'dancing', 'singing', 'animals', 'give', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'value']",G-Force

I saw this 3-D Disney flick in the movies and found it very cute and entertaining. Their mission is to break into the estate of a former arms dealer, hack into his computer, and find out what he developed this special microchip for.  This one FBI Special Agent (Sector Head, I guess) doesn't see any use for the G-Force, so when they APPEAR to have botched a mission, the FBI guy shuts down the operation and the commandos wind up for sale in a pet store. Of course, the story begins here with the team trying to get out and back together again, and continue on with their mission.

This FBI scientist has figure out a way to communicate with them and train them to go on covert missions.  But his funding is about to be taken away.  As a last second hail Mary, he sends out his crack team, consisting of a fly, three guinea pigs, and a mole, to infiltrate a house and get a file off a computer.The mission is a big success, or so it appears.  The next day, at the review, things go horribly wrong and the project is shut down.  The rodents manage to escape to a pet store, but the FBI wants them to keep the entire project completely secret.  Can the rodents escape and foil the plot they've uncovered?  Or will the FBI track them down first?I talked into seeing this movie by my roommate.  The previews just never convinced me it would be great.  And I was right.Now don't get me wrong.  There were some genuine laughs in the film.  The mice we meet in the pet store stole the show, for example.  I couldn't stop laughing at them.  The effects were very well done, too.  But the majority of the movie wasn't that great.The plot was full of cliches from start to finish.  That's not necessarily a deal killer for me, but the rest of the movie has to be good enough to make up for it, and it wasn't.One of the big problems was that the movie just didn't feel like it was going anywhere.  There were lots of jokes and pop cultural references, and I felt like they were designed to hide the fact that the plot was weak from us.  Even the characters were flat and dull.  And I really feel sorry for the humans in the movie who were little more than cardboard characters.  Even the dialogue the characters had was so trite it was cringe worthy.If you can see this movie for free, you'll find a few good laughs.

In a way it reminds of many of Jerry Bruckheimer's works in that it's supposed to be an adventure flick with a bit of comedy but it somehow feels askew (Pirates of the Caribbean anyone?).  All of that feeling transfers here but the difference is that this one is clearly targeted toward an even younger demographic which is bad for two reasons: 1) It isn't bright and crisp like a kids' movie should be and 2) Kids rarely drive themselves to the theater, DVD store meaning adults will likely be watching this one with them.  This is why intelligent humor, even if it goes right over the heads of the kids watching the picture, is crucial.  Sadly, it is lacking here, bit more on that later.The film revolves around a team of trained secret agent animals: guinea pigs Darwin (team leader) (Sam Rockwell), Juarez (martial arts) (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz), Blaster (weapons specialist) (Tracy Morgan), the mole Speckles (cyber intelligence) (Nicolas Cage), and a fly named Mooch (surveillance) (Edwin Louis).This team, in effort to prove its worth as a federally funded agency, takes on a risky mission for the US government to stop evil billionaire Leonard Saber (Bill Nighy), who plans to destroy the world by integrating communication chips into household appliances manufactured and distributed by his company. Before they can complete the mission, the government shuts them down and plans to eliminate the animal-agents because they know too much.  Not only do they find themselves running for their lives, the task of saving man kind from the attack of the killer appliances rests in their pint-sized laps as well.Well I suppose part of the blame for this travesty rests in my apparent lack of pre-purchase investigation.  Despite product descriptions, reviews and even a DVD label that gives up absolutely no clue to the fact that this is in fact a live-action film that just so happens to feature some computer generated animated characters, which is precisely what this is.Not to take anything away from any of the dozens of movies that work of this formula (actually come to think of it, nearly every film made within the past few years has come to rely upon the tactic in one degree or another), it does make a world of difference when one goes into it expecting a fully animated feature ala Cars, Shrek or Ratatouille.The formula for G-Force is almost clever enough to be novel but the film just happens to place itself soundly into the void that exists between children young enough to be dazzled by the cuteness of the visuals and adults old enough to scoff at the ridiculousness of it all.This isn't mere speculation either as I was unable to use the film to hold the attention of the younger set who found the premise too dark, deep and simply boring and yet tweeners and full ought teens I showed it to were equally disinterested on account of the sheer silliness of it all.What you have at the end of the day with G-Force is a film that sparkles with creativity and even shines in a few rare moments of well timed comedy or action but does nothing well enough to warrant owning or for that matter even watching.",2,Odd and Campy and That's the Good News,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,3191,"['G-Force', 'definitely', 'one', 'films', 'hard', 'categorize', 'way', 'many', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'works', 'supposed', 'be', 'adventure', 'flick', 'bit', 'comedy', 'somehow', 'askew', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'anyone', 'feeling', 'transfers', 'here', 'difference', 'one', 'clearly', 'targeted', 'even', 'younger', 'demographic', 'bad', 'two', 'reasons', '1', ""n't"", 'bright', 'crisp', 'kids', 'movie', 'should', 'be', '2', 'Kids', 'rarely', 'drive', 'theater', 'DVD', 'store', 'meaning', 'adults', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'watching', 'one', 'why', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'even', 'right', 'heads', 'kids', 'watching', 'picture', 'crucial', 'Sadly', 'lacking', 'here', 'bit', 'more', 'later.The', 'film', 'around', 'team', 'trained', 'secret', 'agent', 'animals', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'Darwin', 'team', 'leader', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Juarez', 'martial', 'arts', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'Blaster', 'weapons', 'specialist', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'mole', 'Speckles', 'cyber', 'intelligence', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'fly', 'named', 'Mooch', 'surveillance', 'Edwin', 'Louis', '.This', 'team', 'effort', 'prove', 'worth', 'federally', 'funded', 'agency', 'risky', 'mission', 'US', 'government', 'stop', 'evil', 'billionaire', 'Leonard', 'Saber', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'who', 'destroy', 'world', 'integrating', 'communication', 'chips', 'household', 'appliances', 'manufactured', 'distributed', 'company', 'can', 'complete', 'mission', 'government', 'down', 'plans', 'eliminate', 'animal-agents', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'find', 'running', 'lives', 'task', 'saving', 'man', 'kind', 'attack', 'killer', 'rests', 'pint-sized', 'laps', 'well.Well', 'suppose', 'part', 'blame', 'travesty', 'rests', 'apparent', 'lack', 'pre-purchase', 'investigation', 'product', 'descriptions', 'reviews', 'even', 'DVD', 'label', 'up', 'absolutely', 'clue', 'fact', 'fact', 'live-action', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'feature', 'computer', 'generated', 'animated', 'characters', 'precisely', 'what', 'is.Not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'dozens', 'movies', 'work', 'formula', 'actually', 'come', 'think', 'nearly', 'film', 'made', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'come', 'rely', 'tactic', 'one', 'degree', 'make', 'world', 'difference', 'when', 'one', 'expecting', 'fully', 'animated', 'feature', 'ala', 'Cars', 'Shrek', 'Ratatouille.The', 'formula', 'G-Force', 'almost', 'clever', 'enough', 'be', 'novel', 'film', 'just', 'place', 'soundly', 'void', 'children', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'dazzled', 'cuteness', 'visuals', 'adults', 'old', 'enough', 'scoff', 'ridiculousness', ""n't"", 'mere', 'speculation', 'was', 'unable', 'use', 'film', 'hold', 'attention', 'younger', 'set', 'who', 'found', 'premise', 'too', 'dark', 'deep', 'simply', 'boring', 'yet', 'tweeners', 'full', 'ought', 'teens', 'showed', 'were', 'equally', 'disinterested', 'account', 'sheer', 'silliness', 'have', 'end', 'day', 'G-Force', 'film', 'creativity', 'even', 'shines', 'few', 'rare', 'moments', 'well', 'timed', 'comedy', 'action', 'nothing', 'well', 'enough', 'warrant', 'owning', 'matter', 'even', 'watching']",G-Force

I used to work at a pet store so I am already pretty familiar with compatable animals for his age, in case he goes astray and picks an animal that would not be good for his age.  Long story short, he decided on a guinea pig (perfect choice) so when he finally got one after months of researching for Christmas he was so thrilled.

It certainly appears that the movie will be about something really cool, as a band of rodents equipped like a seal team, infiltrate the mansion of an industrialist suspected of engaging in nefarious activity.  Unfortunately after such a promising start, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's project with Disney slides downhill and into the tank, ending up heavily borrowing from the Transformers, in a terrible story that involves machines turning against mankind.It's too bad because the guinea pigs are pretty cute and fun characters, and the animation is outstanding.  For the voice talent, Sam Rockwell and Nicolas Cage are very good, while Jon Favreau (Iron Man films) lays it on pretty thick.  Steve Buscemi is kind of funny, mainly overacting as a caricature of himself.  The human talent is not bad either with Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover), Kelli Garner, and Bill Nighy (Harry Potter And The Deathly Hollows: Part 1) hamming it up.There are some funny bits, but there is a real problem is with the central storyline, which involves a computer virus causing appliances to go haywire, animate, and attack.  To foil this scheme the G-Force engage in some ridiculous over the top battles, taking on a killer coffee maker, and various other appliances that transform into hybrid machines of destruction.  It's technically impressive and flashy, but tends to make things way too complicated than they need to be.  The twist involving a traitor, is another element that really isn't necessary.  The connection between the G-Force and their human associates isn't as well established as it could have been either.  In short, the focus of the film appears to be misguided to some degree.G-Force is perhaps worth seeing for its technical achievements.

It was fun, but this is definitely one of those movies that require you to check your brains at the door. The plot is rather silly, about an entrepreneur [played by Bill Nighy of all people] who plans on taking over the world via his home appliances. The only ones who seem able to stop him are a bunch of guinea pigs, and yes, a mole of superior intellect who have been trained to carry out espionage activities. The guinea pigs comprise Darwin, Juarez, Blaster, and the mole is called Speckles. Well, the Feds get wind of the operation and shut it down, and the animals find themselves in a pet store. To cut a long story short - the rest of the movie deals with Darwin and company trying to free themselves and help bring the bad guy down.My almost 5-year-old was riveted to the screen though a lot of the humor seemed lost on her. The humor was ok, though it did seem pitched more to older kids than the younger ones. There are lots of cute moments as is typical for movies like this, and the CGI effects are pretty decent though not spectacular. My main complaint is the use of tech-speak which came across as overly heavy for a movie geared towards kids...I understand why it was used, but it seemed rather unnecessary. Final verdict - family-friendly, mindless kids' entertainment with the requisite positive messages embedded within, i.e. teamwork, friendship, believing in one's self etc.",3,Harmless and fun entertainment for kids and the adults that accompany them,1252281600,"09 7, 2009",2009,1588,"['were', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'take', 'almost', '5', 'year-old', 'weekend', 'was', 'rooting', 'Ponyo', 'hubby', 'favored', 'G-Force', 'what', 'watched', 'was', 'fun', 'definitely', 'one', 'movies', 'require', 'check', 'brains', 'door', 'plot', 'rather', 'silly', 'entrepreneur', '[', 'played', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'people', ']', 'who', 'taking', 'over', 'world', 'home', 'appliances', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'seem', 'able', 'stop', 'are', 'bunch', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'yes', 'mole', 'superior', 'intellect', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'trained', 'carry', 'out', 'espionage', 'activities', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'comprise', 'Darwin', 'Juarez', 'Blaster', 'mole', 'called', 'Speckles', 'Well', 'Feds', 'get', 'wind', 'operation', 'shut', 'down', 'animals', 'find', 'pet', 'store', 'cut', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'rest', 'movie', 'deals', 'Darwin', 'company', 'trying', 'free', 'help', 'bring', 'bad', 'guy', 'down.My', 'almost', '5-year-old', 'was', 'riveted', 'screen', 'lot', 'humor', 'seemed', 'lost', 'humor', 'was', 'ok', 'did', 'seem', 'pitched', 'more', 'older', 'kids', 'younger', 'ones', 'are', 'lots', 'cute', 'moments', 'typical', 'movies', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'not', 'spectacular', 'main', 'complaint', 'use', 'tech-speak', 'came', 'overly', 'heavy', 'movie', 'geared', 'towards', 'kids', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'used', 'seemed', 'rather', 'unnecessary', 'Final', 'verdict', 'family-friendly', 'mindless', 'kids', 'entertainment', 'requisite', 'positive', 'messages', 'embedded', 'i.e', 'teamwork', 'friendship', 'believing', 'one', 'self', 'etc']",G-Force
