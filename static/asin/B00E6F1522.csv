1665000,A1BGM9TQTG0ZUS,B00E6F1522,"bdlove@earthlink.net ""aka B. D. Love""","[2, 2]","I agree with all the positive reviews; the disagreeable one or two are your bargain basement snark.  Don't bother.What interests me in this selection of songs is the breadth:  iI goes back to the first Roxy and includes the latest, Olympia.  This is a masterful song selection, including covers of Dylan (obviously) but also Neil Young and John Lennon and Sam and Dave.  You get a total sense of the man as an artist who has surveyed decades of music, integrated all them within his repertoire of resources, and approaches everything with both respect and real enthusiasm.  Of the originals, he harkens back to a surprising number from some disputed classic albums, like Bride Stripped Bare and Flesh + Blood.  Both were fine records, dismissed because they were departures, and critics don't like departures.  Hearing Sign of the Times reminded me of what an incredible pop song it is.  My Only Love is so breathtakingly spare and heart wrenching.  From Olympia, there are three selections, one dark disco, one darker disco, and one brilliantly subtle ballad.  It's a daring mix, and it all works out superbly.The band is far from geezer.  (I don't know what the person was thinking when the second drummer, second guitarist, sax/keyboardist are all younger than that reviewer likely is.  By the way, calling a woman a &#34;bird&#34; is pretty pathetic, since she's a great musician and it REALLY shows YOUR age, my friend.  Maybe not chronologically, but for sure in karma years.)  Ferry's voice never sounded better live, because here he dispenses with his dance steps and focuses on the notes, and if you watch, he's actually singing them.  Unlike all the newer synth driven oil-on-velvet bands, who are only looking for five note hooks, with giant manly choirs, that can be adapted to TV commercials.I'm right about this.  Listen to KROQ, listen to TV commercials.  Same riffs.  Real musicians like Ferry are few and far between.  I'm a fan, but this DVD...it was a kick way up in my appreciation.  I think he's nailed it.  Covering his hybrid of Lou's &#34;What Goes On,&#34; which incorporates other Lou songs of the period, is over the top.  It was years earlier; it rocks with more authority now.Ferry rightly deserves his place as an innovator, superior musician and singer,  and a man of uncompromising artistic integrity.  This video is both nostalgic and brand new.  That's the deal in the end, for a great musical provocateur, and NOT just a good commercial slice of velvet.  You can watch this, but listen to it first and foremost.  Best Ferry album ever.",5,"A must for any music fan, any age",1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,2570,"['agree', 'positive', 'reviews', 'disagreeable', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'bargain', 'basement', 'snark', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother.What', 'interests', 'selection', 'songs', 'breadth', 'iI', 'back', 'first', 'Roxy', 'latest', 'Olympia', 'masterful', 'song', 'selection', 'including', 'covers', 'Dylan', 'obviously', 'also', 'Neil', 'Young', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Sam', 'Dave', 'get', 'total', 'sense', 'man', 'artist', 'who', 'surveyed', 'decades', 'music', 'integrated', 'repertoire', 'resources', 'approaches', 'everything', 'respect', 'real', 'enthusiasm', 'originals', 'back', 'surprising', 'number', 'disputed', 'classic', 'albums', 'Bride', 'Stripped', 'Bare', 'Flesh', '+', 'Blood', 'were', 'fine', 'records', 'dismissed', 'were', 'departures', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'departures', 'Hearing', 'Sign', 'Times', 'reminded', 'what', 'incredible', 'pop', 'song', 'Only', 'Love', 'so', 'breathtakingly', 'spare', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'Olympia', 'are', 'three', 'selections', 'one', 'dark', 'disco', 'one', 'darker', 'disco', 'one', 'brilliantly', 'subtle', 'ballad', 'daring', 'mix', 'out', 'superbly.The', 'band', 'far', 'geezer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'person', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'second', 'drummer', 'second', 'guitarist', 'sax/keyboardist', 'are', 'younger', 'reviewer', 'likely', 'way', 'calling', 'woman', '34', 'bird', '34', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'great', 'musician', 'REALLY', 'YOUR', 'age', 'friend', 'Maybe', 'not', 'chronologically', 'sure', 'karma', 'years', 'Ferry', 'voice', 'never', 'sounded', 'better', 'live', 'here', 'dance', 'steps', 'focuses', 'notes', 'watch', 'actually', 'singing', 'newer', 'synth', 'driven', 'oil-on-velvet', 'bands', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'looking', 'five', 'note', 'hooks', 'giant', 'manly', 'choirs', 'can', 'be', 'adapted', 'TV', 'commercials.I', ""'m"", 'right', 'Listen', 'KROQ', 'TV', 'commercials', 'Same', 'riffs', 'Real', 'musicians', 'Ferry', 'are', 'few', 'far', ""'m"", 'fan', 'DVD', 'was', 'kick', 'way', 'appreciation', 'think', 'nailed', 'Covering', 'hybrid', 'Lou', '34', 'What', '34', 'other', 'Lou', 'songs', 'period', 'top', 'was', 'years', 'earlier', 'more', 'authority', 'now.Ferry', 'rightly', 'place', 'innovator', 'superior', 'musician', 'singer', 'man', 'uncompromising', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'video', 'nostalgic', 'brand', 'new', 'deal', 'end', 'great', 'musical', 'provocateur', 'NOT', 'just', 'good', 'commercial', 'slice', 'velvet', 'can', 'watch', 'first', 'foremost', 'Best', 'Ferry', 'album', 'ever']",Live In Lyon
