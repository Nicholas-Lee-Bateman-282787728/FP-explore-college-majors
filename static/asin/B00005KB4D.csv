661759,AE8LL9S715YTE,B00005KB4D,"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2""","[1, 2]","I know what a lot of people have said about this movie, and I know that the eighth Doctor is in that ""fuzzy"" region of the Who universe.  Still.  I love Paul McGann's Doctor.  As he is shown in this movie.  As how he is shown in the Big Finish audio series.  And as how he is developed in the BBC novels.  I would have to say that while I have always loved the 7th Doctor, and what Virgin publishers did for the seventh Doctor, this and the other works under the Doctor by Paul McGann are my treasured possessions in my many Whovian stuff.  This is not what you would call an in-depth movie.  But it is something that is suppose to be for the Who series: fun.  This is a fun movie.  It has full connection to the series (especially if you read the novel Lungbarrow, the last of Virgin 7th Doctor stories) and as well as having the regeneration scene.  Which is somewhat important at least for me.  I love the story, Paul McGann shows himself well as a Doctor.  He builds from the old, develops him, and pushes him toward the future (especially when you connect this tv movie to the novel series and the Big Finish series).  Fun.  Fun.  Fun.  Yes the big problem is that this is only on Region 2.  I had to buy a regionless DVD player to play this, and the other Doctor Who releases.  But you can pick one up for only, say 60 bucks.  Worth the effort.

661760,A1XSW26YGZB1X6,B00005KB4D,Amazon Customer,"[110, 116]","As ""Dark Angel"" and ""Firefly"" fans well know, the talking heads at the FOX network have an uncanny knack for truly sticking it to the science fiction community and this mismash of eleventh-hour script rewrites is no exception.  It's a glorious ""What-Could-Have-Been"" storyline that is brilliant in its first half, falls into incomprehensible mush for the second half, then rushes to an admittedly-satisfying ending.  Visually it borrows heavily from elements of ""X-Files"" and ""E.R.,"" up to and including the hospital-oriented dramatics, with a recurring theme of advancing clock hands/digital clock displays.  The storyline might best be described as a fusion of Pertwee's ""Spearhead From Space"" and Tom Baker's ""The Deadly Assassin"" set in present-day San Fransisco.First off: Paul McGann is brilliant.  He adheres to the cardinal rule of ""reinvent the Doctor the way YOU think he should be played"" that has worked so well for every actor before him, and we get a charming, easily-distracted romantic with a hypnotic gaze.  Eric Roberts likewise brings a great combination of sadism and quirky humour to the Master.  Sylvester McCoy is back on form as the Doctor's seventh incarnation as if he never left, and Daphne Ashbrook manages to steal scenes even when the script has relegated her to the familiar ""stand to the side and ask 'What's it all about, Doctor?'"" routine.  Mention should also be made of Yee Jee Tso's very good performance as the wayward teenager who becomes an unwitting pawn in the Master's plan to regain his physical Time Lord existence.The TARDIS interior is unbelievable.  You get the impression that this is what the series's original designers would have aimed for all along had they the budget.  This TARDIS is truly a living entity, with its own personality traits and an architecture that combines Victorian decor with a Gothic cathedral and then dresses it all up in a Jules Verne wrapping.  Many fundamental premises from the original series are preserved, including the TARDIS key, the contents of the TARDIS's tool kit and even the familiar materialization and ""cloister bell"" sound effects.  Other passing cues include jelly babies, a weirdly long scarf, squawking Daleks in the background, and a ""500 Year Diary.""What the fans haven't been able to accept are the out-of-nowhere plot changes that conflict with many established premises, of the type that seem to have been added to the script for the benefit of new audiences.  Why would the Time Lords construct a time machine who's power source can only be opened by the retinal scan of an alien (human)?  A motorcycle/ambulance chase scene does nothing to advance the plot, although the Doctor's interactions with secondary characters are at times touching, at times hilarious.  There is also an over-reliance on CGI visual effects that, while dazzling to look at, don't really add to the story and end up looking pretty out-of-place (hey, this IS the series famous for its wobbly sets and lurching green bubble-wrap monsters).  I need to also work in some praise here for John Debney and Louis Febre's beautifully composed orchestral soundtrack: there are a number of moments where the music carries the story  --certainly a long way from Dudley Simpson's dull clarinet fanfares or Keff McCulloch's over-synthesized chase scenes.Like it or hate it, this episode IS the only visual representation of the Doctor in his eighth incarnation (McGann would go on to broaden the role in audio adventures), and while it has been accepted as canon by the fan community, the acceptance is a bit grudging.  Nevertheless there are enough definitive ""that IS the Doctor"" moments to offset the weak second-half script, good DOES triumph over evil at the last instant, and of course we all know... the Master WILL be back.",3,"Weak, but certainly not McGann's or Segal's fault",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,3795,"['Dark', 'Angel', 'Firefly', 'fans', 'well', 'know', 'talking', 'heads', 'FOX', 'network', 'have', 'uncanny', 'knack', 'truly', 'sticking', 'science', 'fiction', 'community', 'mismash', 'eleventh-hour', 'script', 'rewrites', 'exception', 'glorious', 'What-Could-Have-Been', 'storyline', 'brilliant', 'first', 'half', 'incomprehensible', 'mush', 'second', 'half', 'then', 'admittedly-satisfying', 'ending', 'Visually', 'heavily', 'elements', 'X-Files', 'E.R.', 'including', 'hospital-oriented', 'dramatics', 'recurring', 'theme', 'advancing', 'clock', 'hands/digital', 'clock', 'displays', 'storyline', 'might', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'fusion', 'Pertwee', 'Spearhead', 'From', 'Space', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Deadly', 'Assassin', 'set', 'present-day', 'San', 'Fransisco.First', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'brilliant', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'reinvent', 'Doctor', 'way', 'YOU', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'actor', 'get', 'charming', 'easily-distracted', 'romantic', 'hypnotic', 'gaze', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'likewise', 'great', 'combination', 'sadism', 'quirky', 'humour', 'Master', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'back', 'form', 'Doctor', 'seventh', 'incarnation', 'never', 'left', 'Daphne', 'Ashbrook', 'steal', 'scenes', 'even', 'when', 'script', 'relegated', 'familiar', 'stand', 'side', 'ask', 'Doctor', 'routine', 'Mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'Yee', 'Jee', 'Tso', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'wayward', 'teenager', 'who', 'unwitting', 'pawn', 'Master', 'plan', 'regain', 'physical', 'Time', 'Lord', 'TARDIS', 'interior', 'unbelievable', 'get', 'impression', 'what', 'series', 'original', 'designers', 'would', 'have', 'aimed', 'along', 'had', 'budget', 'TARDIS', 'truly', 'living', 'entity', 'own', 'personality', 'traits', 'architecture', 'Victorian', 'decor', 'Gothic', 'cathedral', 'then', 'up', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'wrapping', 'Many', 'fundamental', 'premises', 'original', 'series', 'are', 'preserved', 'including', 'TARDIS', 'key', 'contents', 'TARDIS', 'tool', 'kit', 'even', 'familiar', 'materialization', 'cloister', 'bell', 'sound', 'effects', 'Other', 'passing', 'cues', 'include', 'jelly', 'babies', 'weirdly', 'long', 'scarf', 'squawking', 'Daleks', 'background', '500', 'Year', 'Diary', 'What', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'accept', 'are', 'out-of-nowhere', 'plot', 'changes', 'conflict', 'many', 'established', 'premises', 'type', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'script', 'benefit', 'new', 'audiences', 'Why', 'would', 'Time', 'Lords', 'construct', 'time', 'machine', 'who', 'power', 'source', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'opened', 'retinal', 'scan', 'alien', 'human', 'motorcycle/ambulance', 'chase', 'scene', 'nothing', 'advance', 'plot', 'Doctor', 'interactions', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'times', 'touching', 'times', 'hilarious', 'also', 'over-reliance', 'CGI', 'visual', 'effects', 'dazzling', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'story', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'pretty', 'out-of-place', 'hey', 'series', 'famous', 'wobbly', 'sets', 'lurching', 'green', 'bubble-wrap', 'monsters', 'need', 'also', 'work', 'praise', 'here', 'John', 'Debney', 'Louis', 'Febre', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'orchestral', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'number', 'moments', 'where', 'music', 'story', 'certainly', 'long', 'way', 'Dudley', 'Simpson', 'dull', 'clarinet', 'fanfares', 'Keff', 'McCulloch', 'over-synthesized', 'chase', 'scenes.Like', 'hate', 'episode', 'only', 'visual', 'representation', 'Doctor', 'eighth', 'incarnation', 'McGann', 'would', 'go', 'broaden', 'role', 'audio', 'adventures', 'been', 'accepted', 'canon', 'fan', 'community', 'acceptance', 'bit', 'grudging', 'are', 'enough', 'definitive', 'Doctor', 'moments', 'offset', 'weak', 'second-half', 'script', 'good', 'DOES', 'triumph', 'evil', 'last', 'instant', 'course', 'know', 'Master', 'WILL', 'be', 'back']",Doctor Who: The Movie

661764,A37021SSH9LGY6,B00005KB4D,Barbara J. Wertz,"[4, 4]","This made-for-TV movie has been shown only once in the US in 1996.  Back then, I watched it in a hotel room while traveling and couldn't tape it.  Eventually I gave up hope that it would ever be released on DVD or VHS in the US and bought a PAL copy (from amazon.co.uk) to play on my ""hacked"" DVD player.  Murphy's Law being what it is, about a year later the US release finally came.  Accordingly, I haven't really gotten around to watching the US release until now.As another reviewer pointed out, this is a NTSC-to-PAL-back-to-NTSC copy, so there is a bit of a speed-up that happens when NTSC is transferred to PAL.  You'll get used to that.  The US-release DVD has a lot of extras (more than a disc worth) that aren't on the UK-release DVD.  They're generally quite good.I thought that Paul McGann was an excellent Doctor, even though he was stuck with a rather poor script.  The supporting cast is strong, especially Yee Jee Tso playing a young gangster who reforms when the Master turns out to be more evil than even a gangster can stand.  The production was classy for a TV movie of that era.Then there's that script.  I quite agree that it was wrong to make the Doctor half human, and that there's too much time wasted on chases for an 85 minute film.  The opening voice-over tells us that the Daleks, having tried and executed the Master on Skaro, granted his last wish and gave his remains to the Doctor to be returned to Gallifrey.  Give me a break!!  Firstly, the Daleks don't bother with trials.  Secondly, they don't grant last wishes.  And thirdly, if the Doctor came within range of Daleks they would shout ""EXTERMINATE!""  Furthermore, one would think that a movie about time would have gotten the date of the millennium straight.  (OK, I know half the world's population thinks it started on January 1, 2000, but it didn't really start till January 1, 2001.)

This feature-length tale describes the regeneration of Sylvester McCoy's Doctor into Paul McGann's, as well as bringing back the Master, all dressed Terminator style. This adventure, ""Doctor Who: The Movie,"" is controversial for many reasons. The TARDIS has gone all gothic library on itself, the Doctor kisses (oooOOooh!) Grace, the companion of the feature, and...most importantly, they make the Doctor half-human. Well, I am fine with two of these three things. First off, THE TARDIS LOOKS FREAKING AWESOME LIKE THIS. It's so gothic, so steampunk, and so brilliant. It looks like a marvelous time machine...with all the comforts of home! Who wouldn't want to read The Time Machine (or some other book) in there. Second off, yes, I can understand the big problem with the Doctor going all Captain Jack on someone, but you guys have to remember...regenerations can change a man. They can turn a young man in an old man's body into an old man in a young one's. And plus, it's the circle of life. Sure, he'd never done it before, but TV was moving on. Why can't the Doctor have a special someone? He certainly has a lot of them in the New Series, even a wife! And last, yes, this is where I really didn't like a change? Did the Doctor HAVE to be half-human to be likeable? No, he didn't! It just ruins the myths and mysteries built up on this fabulous character? Do E.T. or Superman have to be half-human for you to like them? NO, THEY DON'T. But, I've begun to be able to stand that part after looking at the explanation in the comic book called ""The Forgotten."" I reccomend it, if for that reason alone. And the rest of the movie? Fine as well. Paul McGann is a great Doctor, quite likeable. And Sylvester McCoy always has been, even if he only has a few lines. Plus, there's motorcycle chases, jelly babies, and incredible jerks. Substantial parts to many different movies or Doctor Who stories.Now, i'm not going to review the DVD, because I don't actually own it. I just watched it on the recent Doctors Revisited special. I am planning to get it though, so I might update the review if I do.So, in all, this is not the best Doctor Who story ever, no, but it is really far from the worst. With the great Doctor(s), nice little tidbits, and decent story, you can forgive the half-human lies and the Master's range of acting as long as my fingernail.

(eg The Doctor is half human??)I found Eric Roberts as The Master very entertaining.  I did not care for the portrayal of the Daleks.

I also got an odd feeling.  It's part BBC Doctor Who and part ""Hollywood"".  I didn't really look to see who worked on this movie, but if wasn't Hollywood studios I'll be surprised.  I've got nothing against Hollywood when they do their thing, but there are some things that just don't work as a Hollywood production or with a Hollywood feel.  Doctor Who isn't their thing.The Doctor is put in charge of getting The Master's remains back to Gallifrey.  The remains get loose, hijack a human body and, of course, all hell breaks loose just in time for Y2K.  The Doctor and his human doctor must make things right less we face a real end of the world doomsday scenario.  And that's where the Hollywood feel comes into play.  Big car chases through San Francisco freeways (complete with chickens blocking traffic).  Big glitzy parties that the doctor's companion can just happen to get into when the doctor doesn't have his aliens tools handy.  Etc.The doctor was great.  The Tardis was great.  Everything else was just okay and would not have worked in the series, not today anyway.I don't really like most Hollywood Sci-fi or most action movies... the feel in those  movies that makes me not like them was all here.  But there's just enough of what makes Doctor Who, well, Doctor Who to allow me to still give it 3 stars.  It's okay. Just don't expect great things from it.

I waited years, decades even for the North American attempt at Doctor Who, and whoever the producers were at least they had the foresight to no. 1 use a British actor and no. 2 being in Sylvester McCoy for proper continuity sakes.But I've heard rumor that the ONLY two classic series episodes, which I consider this to be that were ever shot entirely on film are Spearhead From Space and Doctor Who The Movie (1996) unless you are talking the Peter Cushing films which I don't consider cannon... And really if you are a completest like me then you want even those films released in the U.S. as well on BD.But personally besides Spearhead, most of all I want Doctor Who The Movie Special Edition released on Blu-ray where it belongs in glorious widescreen if it was truly made using film instead of tape like most of the rest of the classic series. What's also great about this besides the production values is that we really get our first glimpse of a truly new TARDIS interior which is grand and it's a shame they didn't keep it for the beginning of the new series or at least show it in The Day of the Doctor, after all The War Doctor was next in line (apparently) so he should have still had the 'desktop theme' from this era and Doctor Who the Movie is the gap that fills in the bridge between the old series and the new so it is definitely a Key part of the whole DW Universe.I just wish the producers (Peter Moffat) paid much more respect to Paul McGann and this incarnation and gave McGann more to do with the new series... they've had the 5th Doctor (Peter Davison) meet the 10th Doctor (David Tennant) in Time-Crash and Paul McGann still looks very good so why wasn't he included in The Day of the Doctor? Sure he was in The Night of the Doctor and that was fantastic... but I and I'm sure a lot of people would love to see some stand alone specials featuring the beloved Doctor No. 8 as there are many adventures that we would all love not to miss out on...",5,"I have it, but waiting for the Blu-ray widescreen release!

Where could this have gone? If only the TARDIS had been liberated to land all over the world - not just the U.K. or USA, but Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, etc. Thank you to Philip David Segal for the stubborn persistence in getting this thing made after the ten year ruination under the infamous John Nathan-Turner, that demented question-mark celery laden pox on Who.Problems: The half-human issue. The Spielberg Strings. The Dirty Nerds in ""Strange Love."" Co-Producer Jo Wright attacks on Sylvester McCoy, who in fact did a great job! It's in poor taste, and a case of BBC ""smoke and mirrors,"" to attack Sly McCoy and his Doctor Who. The show's low ratings prior to cancellation were the result of the horrible disco/cutesy nonsense of John Nathan-Turner and his crew of BBC sanctioned Doctor Destroyers. Even the marvelous Radiophonic Workshop ruined the music under JNT's direction. What a shame. Back to this TV movie: The silly motorcycle chases. The unsubtle romance stuff. The repeated New Year's countdown. The female Doc's wardrobe. Eric Roberts' camp. The snake spit.BUT the pluses outweigh these issues, especially Paul McGann's and Sylvester McCoy's acting. The surgery. The horror (though I don't have two hearts, I've woken up during surgery - well depicted). The regeneration scene is priceless. The humor and pathos. The Frankenstein movie. The interior of the TARDIS is FANTASTIC. Segal gets what the TARDIS is about. Infinite. Cozy. Cool. The Doctors (McCoy, McGann) both indulge in Jelly Babies, H.G. Wells, and vintage jazz.

I had a feeling that they were going to try and ""Americanize"" the Doctor, and I was right.It starts off with the Master's trial on Skaro (!).  In Doctor Who folklore, that would never happen.  The Daleks would never have a trial for The Master.  The Daleks would more than likely have a trial for the Doctor, who was their arch enemy.  It goes downhill from there.  Eric Roberts is the Master here, and he doesn't really know how to play a renegade Time Lord.  He can be a good actor with good material, but this TV movie was a bone headed decision from the beginning.There are too many special effects (and violence) in this, making it uncomfortable to watch at times and it has none of the wit and intelligence of vintage Doctor Who.  Despite having low expectations going in, the makers of this still managed to exceed those low expectations.On the plus side, Paul McGann is wonderful as the Doctor, and it's a shame that when they started the series again in the U.K., they didn't put him in it as the Doctor.

Finally, a DVD is going to be released in 2011. It has only been aired once in the U.S. and never been shown again nor has it ever been released on home video in the states before now. It is the only on-screen appearance of Eighth Doctor Paul McGann, and the only Dr. Who ever produced by an American company.Now the story does have its problems, and doesn't quite deserve five stars, but it's still a great adventure that deserved to be released long before now which is why I'm giving this DVD release five stars. Some of the problems include some continuity errors in the story and some unanswered questions. But over all, it does have a great action-packed story with some great directing and performances. I still found it to be highly enjoyable.The Plot:The Master is executed on the Dalek planet Skaro. His last request was for his arhenemy, the Doctor, to take his remains back to their home planet of Gallifrey. As the Doctor put it ""It was a request they should never have granted.""The Seventh Doctor Sylvester McCoy is on his way to Gallifrey with the Master's remains. But the Master has managed to somewhat regenerate into an oozing snake-like creature and sabotages the TARDIS, causing it to make an emergency landing on Earth in the year 1999.Upon arrival, the Doctor gets caught in the crossfire of a gang shoot-out and gets shot forcing him to regenerate into Eighth Doctor Paul McGann. The Master has taken over the body of an ambulance driver played by Eric Roberts. But the body won't last long. With a quickly disintergrating body, the Master intends to take over the Doctor's body by opening and using the TARDIS's power source, the Eye of Harmony. But with the Eye opened, it threatens to suck the Earth through it. Now the Doctor and new companion Dr. Grace Holloway must race against time to save the planet.Highly recommended!",5,Finally!,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,1979,"['Due', 'complex', 'copywrite', 'issues', 'film', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'U.S.', '1996', 'television', 'premiere', 'now', 'Finally', 'DVD', 'going', 'be', 'released', '2011', 'only', 'been', 'aired', 'once', 'U.S.', 'never', 'been', 'shown', 'again', 'ever', 'been', 'released', 'home', 'video', 'states', 'now', 'only', 'on-screen', 'appearance', 'Eighth', 'Doctor', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'only', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'ever', 'produced', 'American', 'company.Now', 'story', 'have', 'problems', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deserve', 'five', 'stars', 'still', 'great', 'adventure', 'deserved', 'be', 'released', 'long', 'before', 'now', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'DVD', 'release', 'five', 'stars', 'problems', 'include', 'continuity', 'errors', 'story', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'have', 'great', 'action-packed', 'story', 'great', 'directing', 'performances', 'still', 'found', 'be', 'highly', 'enjoyable.The', 'Plot', 'Master', 'executed', 'Dalek', 'planet', 'Skaro', 'last', 'request', 'was', 'arhenemy', 'Doctor', 'take', 'remains', 'back', 'home', 'planet', 'Gallifrey', 'Doctor', 'put', 'was', 'request', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'granted', 'Seventh', 'Doctor', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'way', 'Gallifrey', 'Master', 'remains', 'Master', 'managed', 'somewhat', 'regenerate', 'oozing', 'snake-like', 'creature', 'TARDIS', 'causing', 'make', 'emergency', 'landing', 'Earth', 'year', '1999.Upon', 'arrival', 'Doctor', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'gang', 'shoot-out', 'shot', 'forcing', 'regenerate', 'Eighth', 'Doctor', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'Master', 'taken', 'over', 'body', 'ambulance', 'driver', 'played', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'body', 'wo', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'quickly', 'disintergrating', 'body', 'Master', 'take', 'over', 'Doctor', 'body', 'opening', 'using', 'TARDIS', 'power', 'source', 'Eye', 'Harmony', 'Eye', 'opened', 'suck', 'Earth', 'Now', 'Doctor', 'new', 'companion', 'Dr.', 'Grace', 'Holloway', 'must', 'race', 'time', 'save', 'planet.Highly', 'recommended']",Doctor Who: The Movie

661788,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00005KB4D,John Kwok,"[6, 8]","I'm delighted that most fans of the original BBC-produced television series and the BBC itself, regard this FOX/BBC co-production as part of the official canon of ""Doctor Who""; which is once more the longest-running science fiction television series ever aired. Sadly, I wished that FOX hadn't meddled with the film's production or ignored the fact that it did earn impressive ratings as an original made-for-television film both here in the United States and the United Kingdom, and decided not to pursue the possibility of reviving ""Doctor Who"" with the talented British actor Paul McGann as the eight incarnation of The Doctor. Set in modern-day San Francisco (circa 1995), ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" is yet another fascinating tale devoted to The Doctor and his Gallifreyan nemesis, The Master. The Tardis (The Doctor's time machine/spaceship, which is a magnificient update of the BBC version, depicted finally as a living, breathing spaceship.), carrying both The Doctor (Sylvester McCoy as the seventh incarnation, in yet another impressive performance from McCoy, who was last seen in this role in the late 1980s, when the BBC decided not to continue with ""Doctor Who"".) and the remains of The Master, crash-lands unexpectedly in San Francisco. A superb transformation sequence follows, with McCoy's Doctor morphing into McGann's half-human version. Meanwhile, The Master escapes, and finds a temporary home in a human (who's brilliantly portrayed by Eric Roberts, in a performance that is unmistakenly Roberts' own, without homage to Roger Delgado's or Anthony Ainley's versions); before too long, he begins matching wits with The Doctor and the Doctor's new American companion, Grace Holloway, portrayed by Daphne Ashbrook, threatening the survival of the city of San Francisco.  Both Whovians (long-time fellow ""Doctor Who"" fans) and those unfamiliar with the BBC-produced television series will enjoy this fine feature-length Doctor Who. But I suspect that many Whovians will also ask why this potential rebirth of the ""Doctor Who"" series wasn't pursued by FOX. Fortunately for Whovians, the BBC finally listened to their pleas, launching the return of ""Doctor Who"" last year, which was greeted in the United Kingdom and elsewhere with ample critical and popular acclaim.",4,"Decent ""Doctor Who"" Tale That Could Have Been a Great Rebirth With Paul McGann as The Doctor",1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,2280,"[""'m"", 'delighted', 'most', 'fans', 'original', 'BBC-produced', 'television', 'series', 'BBC', 'regard', 'FOX/BBC', 'co-production', 'part', 'official', 'canon', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'once', 'more', 'longest-running', 'science', 'fiction', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'aired', 'Sadly', 'wished', 'FOX', 'had', ""n't"", 'meddled', 'film', 'production', 'ignored', 'fact', 'did', 'earn', 'impressive', 'ratings', 'original', 'made-for-television', 'film', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'decided', 'not', 'pursue', 'possibility', 'reviving', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'talented', 'British', 'actor', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'eight', 'incarnation', 'Doctor', 'Set', 'modern-day', 'San', 'Francisco', 'circa', '1995', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Movie', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'tale', 'devoted', 'Doctor', 'Gallifreyan', 'nemesis', 'Master', 'Tardis', 'Doctor', 'time', 'machine/spaceship', 'magnificient', 'update', 'BBC', 'version', 'depicted', 'finally', 'living', 'breathing', 'spaceship', 'carrying', 'Doctor', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'seventh', 'incarnation', 'yet', 'impressive', 'performance', 'McCoy', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'role', 'late', '1980s', 'when', 'BBC', 'decided', 'not', 'continue', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'remains', 'Master', 'crash-lands', 'unexpectedly', 'San', 'Francisco', 'A', 'superb', 'transformation', 'sequence', 'McCoy', 'Doctor', 'morphing', 'McGann', 'half-human', 'version', 'Meanwhile', 'Master', 'escapes', 'temporary', 'home', 'human', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'performance', 'unmistakenly', 'Roberts', 'own', 'homage', 'Roger', 'Delgado', 'Anthony', 'Ainley', 'versions', 'too', 'long', 'matching', 'wits', 'Doctor', 'Doctor', 'new', 'American', 'companion', 'Grace', 'Holloway', 'portrayed', 'Daphne', 'Ashbrook', 'threatening', 'survival', 'city', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Whovians', 'long-time', 'fellow', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fans', 'unfamiliar', 'BBC-produced', 'television', 'series', 'will', 'enjoy', 'fine', 'feature-length', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'suspect', 'many', 'Whovians', 'will', 'also', 'ask', 'why', 'potential', 'rebirth', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'pursued', 'FOX', 'Fortunately', 'Whovians', 'BBC', 'finally', 'listened', 'pleas', 'launching', 'return', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'greeted', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'elsewhere', 'ample', 'critical', 'popular', 'acclaim']",Doctor Who: The Movie

Would we be thrilling over the adventures of David Tennent (Doctor number 10)? Would the show have out lasted the last Millennium? All I can say is that when this TV movie/Back door Pilot aired in the summer of '96 I was exstatic and I was not dissappointed! This movie acts as the bridge between the classic series and the current series, updating the visuals FX and adding a dash of sexy cool. The Doctor (Sylvester McCoy, Doctor number 7), while transporting the remains of his old enemy the Master (Eric Roberts ""The Dark Knight"" TV's ""Heroes""), is forced to land the TARDIS in San Fransico China Town on new years eve 1999. He dies, regenerates, battles the wonderfully deranged Master, snoggs his companion and saves the planet. Classic Doctor Who with maybe a bit too many refrences to the classic series but still worth owning for any true fan. It's so long Sylvester McCoy and hello Paul McGann (whose likeness was featured on the novels, comics and whose voice was featured in animated web casts and radio drama as current as 2007 has the least amount of screen time for any actor who has played the Doctor but remains the longest name attached to the character to date).

After all we are dealing with a 900 year old alien who changes bodies periodically and travels time and space in a police phone box.  I found the story a lot of fun.  I enjoyed seeing the seventh doctor included, it lent continuity to the story line for the fans of the series.

661800,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B00005KB4D,Little Roy Blue,"[7, 7]","This made-for-TV movie is a strange beast; the only episode of Doctor Who to be co-produced by Americans, it attempted (and failed) to relaunch the series for a multinational audience in 1996. Thus, many Doctor Who fans regard this movie as a weird aberration - America's lone, tacky contribution to the Doctor Who mythos, sandwiched uncomfortably between the original and relaunched British versions.I don't quite share that negative view of this movie, however. As an American myself, I've always wanted to see Doctor Who take off in the U.S. - and this movie remains Who's only truly significant foray into the U.S. market. Such concerns aside, I also admire the movie for its slick production values and sense of fun. To me, this is still the best-looking Doctor Who production of all time, particularly in terms of sets (huge), extras (numerous), and direction (arty-farty).Certainly, Matthew Jacobs' often-convoluted script needed some work; if you compare it to ""Caves of Androzani"" or ""Midnight,"" you're bound to be disappointed. But I'd still rather watch this movie than, say, anything involving the Quarks or the Slitheen - if only for Paul McGann's charismatic performance as the Eighth Doctor, and his awesome TARDIS interior.But even for fans who hate the Doctor Who TV Movie, there should be no denying that this is a first-rate DVD package. The remastered movie itself looks and sounds great (why no Blu-ray version, I wonder?) But the real attraction is the huge array of special features. The longest is a documentary called ""The Seven Year Hitch"" about the movie's epic production history; though a little dry, it offers some compelling glimpses into the workings (and thought processes) of the BBC.Another standout feature (not listed on the back of the DVD, oddly enough) is Paul McGann's audition tapes; these are particularly interesting, because he reads from a totally different script from the one ultimately used for the movie. Other cool features include: special effects tests for CGI Daleks; a featurette on press coverage for the TV Movie; another featurette on how interest in post-cancellation Doctor Who was sustained by books, comics, and fan videos; and a fun roundtable discussion in which three nerdy fans talk about what they like (and dislike) in the movie.Overall, this is easily one of the best Doctor Who DVD releases, putting many Hollywood releases to shame; so even if you're lukewarm or hostile toward the movie itself, I'd consider picking it up.",4,Flawed but fun movie; great DVD,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,2494,"['made-for-TV', 'movie', 'strange', 'beast', 'only', 'episode', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'be', 'co-produced', 'Americans', 'attempted', 'failed', 'relaunch', 'series', 'multinational', 'audience', '1996', 'Thus', 'many', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'regard', 'movie', 'weird', 'aberration', 'America', 'lone', 'tacky', 'contribution', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'mythos', 'sandwiched', 'uncomfortably', 'original', 'relaunched', 'British', 'versions.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'share', 'negative', 'view', 'movie', 'however', 'American', 'myself', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'take', 'off', 'U.S.', 'movie', 'Who', 'only', 'truly', 'significant', 'foray', 'U.S.', 'market', 'Such', 'concerns', 'aside', 'also', 'admire', 'movie', 'slick', 'production', 'values', 'sense', 'fun', 'still', 'best-looking', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'production', 'time', 'particularly', 'terms', 'sets', 'huge', 'extras', 'numerous', 'direction', 'arty-farty', '.Certainly', 'Matthew', 'Jacobs', 'often-convoluted', 'script', 'needed', 'work', 'compare', 'Caves', 'Androzani', 'Midnight', ""'re"", 'bound', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'d"", 'still', 'rather', 'watch', 'movie', 'say', 'anything', 'involving', 'Quarks', 'Slitheen', 'only', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'Eighth', 'Doctor', 'awesome', 'TARDIS', 'interior.But', 'even', 'fans', 'who', 'hate', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'TV', 'Movie', 'should', 'be', 'denying', 'first-rate', 'DVD', 'package', 'remastered', 'movie', 'great', 'why', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'wonder', 'real', 'attraction', 'huge', 'array', 'special', 'features', 'longest', 'documentary', 'called', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Hitch', 'movie', 'epic', 'production', 'history', 'little', 'dry', 'compelling', 'glimpses', 'workings', 'thought', 'processes', 'BBC.Another', 'standout', 'feature', 'not', 'listed', 'back', 'DVD', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'audition', 'tapes', 'are', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'totally', 'different', 'script', 'one', 'ultimately', 'used', 'movie', 'Other', 'cool', 'features', 'include', 'special', 'effects', 'tests', 'CGI', 'Daleks', 'featurette', 'press', 'coverage', 'TV', 'Movie', 'featurette', 'how', 'interest', 'post-cancellation', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'sustained', 'books', 'comics', 'fan', 'videos', 'fun', 'roundtable', 'discussion', 'three', 'nerdy', 'fans', 'talk', 'what', 'like', 'dislike', 'movie.Overall', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'DVD', 'putting', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'releases', 'shame', 'so', 'even', ""'re"", 'lukewarm', 'hostile', 'movie', ""'d"", 'consider', 'picking', 'up']",Doctor Who: The Movie

So long remembered as Paul McGann's one TV appearance as the Doctor or as that time the Americans ruined Doctor Who, the TV Movie was written off for a long time. It also faded into obscurity for many US fans due to the rights issues between the BBC and Universal kept it from receiving first a VHS and then later a DVD release. With the DVD finally out and with the TV Movie's profile rising again, perhaps we can finally see it  for being more then the single televised adventure of the eighth Doctor but also the comeback that should have been.Perhaps the biggest highlight of the movie is that contains Paul McGann's debut as the eighth Doctor. Some of the actors who've played the Doctor have found their feet after some time, others almost immediately and it would seem that McGann is one of the latter. From the moment he appears walking out of a morgue in a shroud to the last scene in the TARDIS, McGann embodies everything the Doctor should be: eccentric, intelligent, melancholic at times yet be an all around watchable and likeable character. The American setting in fact highlights the eccentric qualities of McGann's performance even more. Perhaps the greatest shame of the TV movie is that this would be McGann's sole Doctor Who TV appearance.There's also a good supporting cast backing him up. Playing the companion is Daphne Ashbrook as Dr. Grace Holloway who goes from a simple operation into an adventure with the fate of the world at stake. It helps that McGann shares some fine chemistry with her and the movie shines whenever they're together. Ashbrook also makes Grace's back and forth swapping about whether or not to believe the Doctor work despite the fact that it makes very little sense. There's also Yee Jee Tso as Chang Lee who does a adequate job due in what seems due in large part to the script rather than his skills as an actor. Not forgetting of course Sylvester McCoy's all too short appearance as the seventh Doctor in the opening minutes either though his appearance seems rather unnecessary and potentially over complicates the film for anyone seeing Doctor Who for the first time (something that this TV Movie was supposed to be for).Which rather brings us to Eric Roberts as the Master. I mus confess that I am in two minds about Roberts' performance. There are times when he is actually quite sinister such as the scene when he initially meets Chang Lee in the TARDIS. Yet for the most part, Roberts is over the top at every possible occasion such as the ""I always dress for the occasion!"" line for example. The Roberts Master then is sinister yet over the top but whether that helps or hurts the film is left up to the individual viewer to decide.The production values could easily rival anything that the new series has yet produced. Of particular mention is the music of composer John Debney's score, the first time that Doctor Who had gotten the feel of having a full orchestral score including the excellent version of the Doctor Who Theme used in the opening and closing credits. The design of the TARDIS interior with its Gothic/Jules Verne, almost steam punk, feel is also of note. There is also the superb direction of Geoffrey Sax throughout the entire movie which does its best to ride the fine line between the Britishness of the series and the American setting, something in which it sometimes succeeds and sometimes doesn't.Which leads to the script. For something that was meant to be the launch of an American co-produced  Doctor Who TV series yet is is seemingly continuity heavy. Within the first few minutes for example the viewer has the Master, the Daleks, regeneration, the TARDIS and two different Doctors being thrown at them. The movie itself works well with its mix of humor and a good vs evil storyline as the plot heads towards the Millennium (remember this was shown in 1996)  until the ending. While there's plenty of plot holes along the way (such as the aforementioned business with Grace shifting back and forth about believing the Doctor), for the most part though the story holds up despite those faults.Where does all of that leave the TV Movie then? It features a fine debut for the eighth Doctor, good performances and has some fine production values. While it has its faults, the fact that this was more or less a pilot does excuse some of the faults present.

One word of caution, however - the Doctor Who Restoration Team has confirmed that the main feature on the DVD was taken from the PAL master, not the NTSC master.What does that mean for US/Canada audiences?  As the TV movie was originally shot and broadcast in North American using the NTSC standard,  that means that this conversion is NTSC -> PAL -> and back to NTSC.  The feature presentation will suffer from PAL-speed up, running about 4% faster than originally broadcast on Fox back in 1996.  Perceptive viewers (who may have recorded this on VHS when it originally aired) will notice that everyone's voice is pitched slightly higher and that the movie runs faster (looking similar to how ""time-compressed"" airings of shows look on basic cable syndication).Most American viewers probably won't even notice the changes but they are there nonetheless and the more perceptive (or pedantic) fans will notice.  Still, with that said, the extras package looks great and I can forgive the PAL speed up (I'm used to it by now, having imported the Region 2 DVD release years ago).",4,One word of caution...,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,1185,"['everyone', 'else', ""'m"", 'ecstatic', 'title', 'finally', 'getting', 'official', 'North', 'American', 'DVD', 'release', 'One', 'word', 'caution', 'however', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Restoration', 'Team', 'confirmed', 'main', 'feature', 'DVD', 'was', 'taken', 'PAL', 'master', 'not', 'NTSC', 'master.What', 'mean', 'US/Canada', 'audiences', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'broadcast', 'North', 'American', 'using', 'NTSC', 'standard', 'conversion', 'NTSC', '>', 'PAL', '>', 'back', 'NTSC', 'feature', 'presentation', 'will', 'suffer', 'PAL-speed', 'up', 'running', 'about', '4', '%', 'faster', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'Fox', 'back', '1996', 'Perceptive', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'recorded', 'VHS', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'will', 'notice', 'everyone', 'voice', 'pitched', 'slightly', 'higher', 'movie', 'faster', 'looking', 'similar', 'how', 'time-compressed', 'airings', 'shows', 'look', 'basic', 'cable', 'syndication', '.Most', 'American', 'viewers', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'changes', 'are', 'there', 'nonetheless', 'more', 'perceptive', 'pedantic', 'fans', 'will', 'notice', 'Still', 'said', 'extras', 'package', 'great', 'can', 'forgive', 'PAL', 'speed', 'up', ""'m"", 'used', 'now', 'having', 'imported', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'release', 'years', 'ago']",Doctor Who: The Movie

Paul m. does a fine job as the new doctor and sylvester mccoy ends his era with this one. Of course this isn't storywise as good as later efforts but if they had shot more eps this would have been a great series for the doctor. I don't agree with those that say eric roberts isn't good as the master. He' playing aparamedic who gets taken over by the master and that is quite different than the old master really. So he's fine in this one. This edition is a longtime coming too, for many years there was some doubt if we'd ever get this on dvd here. But we have and I am glad to have it, (therights were in question as this was done by two companies). This has plenty of extras and looks great. If you like doctor who  then you should enjoy this one. As it's not as old as the older series. Which I love but some fans might not like because of the very low budget effects.

I would have LOVED to see an entire series ... it cracks me UP that they wouldn't wannabe a part of such a cult classic!As a whole ... the movie with PM here ... it's standard american fare of the time ... sad that. Someone missed with the plot but it turns out ok in the end. It is a nice addition to the Who family and the Big Finish audio plays are amazing! Love the books!There are several memorable moments in this movie ... one is the Doctor's kiss ... it paved the way for CE in the first season of the New Who to be a little more (I really have no idea how to eaplain it LOL) but yeah ... he is a litle more open to ""romance"" in the new series. IDK if I like that. BUT they've kept it to a minimum ... so I think it might be for the best that the new series is out of the UK ... we woulda had The Doctor hoppiing from bed to bed in no time.I love Paul McGann, he did a great job with what he had in this movie!!

And even stupider was how she didn't believe him even after all that happened after that.  I didn't feel the least bit sad when the Master killed her.

I have posted the info here from the know all, and see all on Doctor Who DVD's. Here is Steve Manfred's info on Doctor Who - The Movie - Special Edition.LINK: [...]Over 14 years after its production and broadcast, the Doctor Who TV Movie starring Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor will finally see release in North America!!!This 2-disc release will be on Tuesday, February 8th, 2011 for the suggested retail price of $34.98, under the title: Doctor Who - The Movie - Special Edition. 2entertain's Commissioning Editor Dan Hall revealed this surprise news on the ""Hoo on Who"" podcast (available on iTunes) on August 25. He was successful in negotiating release rights for this production outside of the UK that had previously been held by the co-producers of the TV Movie, Universal Television. This clears the way for a release in North America by BBC Worldwide Americas.The version that will see release is a new edition that was made available in the UK in October as part of what they're calling the Revisitations Box Set, where three previously available titles were re-released together with boosted extra features. The McGann TV Movie is one of them. The others will see release in North America later in 2011.For those of you who don't know, ""the TV Movie"" as it is called was a one-off attempt to revive Doctor Who in 1996 as a ""back door pilot"" for the Fox Network in the U.S. It was a co-production by Universal Television, BBC Worldwide Americas, and Fox.In it, we see the Seventh Doctor regenerate into the Eighth, and embark on an adventure to save the Earth from being destroyed by the TARDIS after the Master opens its power source, on the eve of the new millennium. Ratings on Fox were not strong enough to warrant a series, and nothing else happened with the TV rights until 2005, although the McGann Eighth Doctor continued on in the spinoff fiction of original novels, audio dramas, and comic strips, all of which will be highlighted in the extra features on the upcoming DVD:Disc 1 86 minute movie with stereo audio.

661813,A1Y68IEVYH6HM4,B00005KB4D,Sea Laughing,"[0, 0]","As a long time fan of &#34;Doctor Who,&#34; I was a bit disappointed when this movie was first shown.  This movie, originally titled &#34;The Enemy Within,&#34; was made with the hope of bringing the beloved camp British series to the U.S.  At the time, their attempts to 'Americanize' the Doctor didn't impress me (or other U.S. viewers) and this show failed in the ratings.Almost twenty years later, times have changed and my opinion has changed with it.  Watching this now, I can see that many elements of the New Series are present.  I guess this movie was just a little ahead of its time.What many Americans fail to understand about the original series is that it was intended to be a children's show.  When viewed in that context, the famous campiness of the classic &#34;Who&#34; makes sense.  The monsters were deliberately designed to look fake, because back in the 60s and 70s, the conservative British mums didn't want their kiddies to be too frightened.  For years, &#34;Doctor Who&#34; was shown during Saturday tea time so the entire family could watch it together, and it followed the formula of ridiculous monsters & villains to thrill the kids combined with young, adorable companions to add spice for the Daddies.When &#34;Star Wars&#34; came out in 1977, science fiction suddenly acquired a huge fan base, but the low-tech special effects of &#34;Doctor Who&#34; suffered by comparison.  By 1990, the show was losing steam, and the producers attempted to add more mature fare&#8212;but the sudden addition of sexual innuendo and violence didn't go over well with British moms, and the show was cancelled.  At that point, the BBC sold the limited rights to American cable and this movie was made.SPOILER ALERT!My main issue with the plot of this movie is the revelation that the Doctor is half-human.  This detail has never appeared in any of the British episodes, and I've never liked the idea that our favorite Time Lord isn't fully alien.  And the insinuation that Dr. Grace Holloway is his mother is quite disturbing, considering that he and the doctor share a kiss.  (Though it's clearly a rather chaste kiss, it's a bit too long for comfort when the ending is taken into account.)END OF SPOILERAfter watching this again, I'm completely charmed by Paul McGann's wonderful portrayal of the Doctor.  It's a shame such a talented actor didn't get the chance to play this role for many years.  I still don't really like Daphne Ashbrook much, and maybe part of my dislike stems from the storyline itself.  Yee Jee Tso overemotes with enthusiasm in true, classic &#34;Who&#34; fashion.  I'll acknowledge that Eric Roberts did a fine job as the Master, and his interpretation locks into John Sim's manic and degenerative Master in a way that now makes sense, though I must admit, his version didn't sit well with me originally when compared to the suave evil of Roger Delgado and Anthony Ainley.  However, Roberts' grating performance works well in the plot's context, and sets the stage for the later evolution into Sims' psychotic version of the Master.This movie is the bridge between the classic &#34;Doctor Who,&#34; and the more mature New Series of today.

Although it was a sad to watch Sylvester McCoy pass the sonic screwdriver, Paul McGann was/is the perfect Doctor.  Not only did he bring his own charm and presence to the role, he also reminded me of many of his incarnations that went before.  He sounded much like Peter Davison's Doctor, was as eccentric as Tom Baker's, and the motorcycle chase was very much in the mold of Jon Pertwee's ""man of action.""  Thankfully he was much more likeable than, uh, some of the other fellows.I thought the TARDIS was the finest, and is still the finest TARDIS that ever was- and if you look at the console design, the time rotor and support structures have been carried on to the new series, as well as the fast American TV style and emphasis on action, and the romantic nature of the Doctor. Looking back you can see the transition from the classic series to the new in this movie.I must dismiss the comments of the detractors of this movie.  Doctor Who previously was not (or should not have been) known for it's continuity. You could argue this move ""bends the laws of time"" a bit, but with the Doctor, that is to be expected. All I know is that my sons, before this movie, could not understand my fascination with Doctor Who.  They liked this movie, and are now fans of the Classic and new Series.My only real and true regret is that this movie was not the pilot for the Doctor Who Series that was to immediate follow.

This was supposed to be a pilot for a regular series in which the doctor was played by Paul McGann. Instead it gave the writers of the Doctor Who books an 8th doctor to play with and Paul McGann some voice-over work.Still, this movie has its weak points such as the car chase scene and the weird admission that the Doctor is half-human. Not all the fans liked him macking with his co-star, but I didn't mind that at all (I thought it was pretty obvious that the Doctor and Romana had something going and not just because the actors were married) and the storyline isn't terribly original.Still the movie moves along nicely. It gives Sylvester McCoy a finale for his version and the acting is solid. Paul McGann does what he can with the character (although he doesn't take it in a working class direction like Christopher Eccleston) and Eric Roberts gets to play the Master in his own way (unlike poor Anthony Ainley who spent his time imitating Roger Delgado's Master) and the supporting cast aren't so bad.So if you have a chance to get ahold of this pilot, or if the BBC/Fox people ever see fit to release it (despite the low ratings and fan disapproval) definitely buy it.",4,Not bad,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,1272,"['1996', 'hopes', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'revival', 'were', 'bouyed', 'up', 'then', 'dashed', 'ground', 'Fox', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'pilot', 'regular', 'series', 'doctor', 'was', 'played', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'Instead', 'gave', 'writers', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'books', '8th', 'doctor', 'play', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'voice-over', 'work.Still', 'movie', 'weak', 'points', 'such', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'weird', 'admission', 'Doctor', 'half-human', 'Not', 'fans', 'liked', 'macking', 'co-star', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Doctor', 'Romana', 'had', 'something', 'going', 'not', 'just', 'actors', 'were', 'married', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'original.Still', 'movie', 'along', 'nicely', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'finale', 'version', 'acting', 'solid', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'what', 'can', 'character', ""n't"", 'take', 'working', 'class', 'direction', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'play', 'Master', 'own', 'way', 'poor', 'Anthony', 'Ainley', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'imitating', 'Roger', 'Delgado', 'Master', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad.So', 'have', 'chance', 'get', 'ahold', 'pilot', 'BBC/Fox', 'people', 'ever', 'see', 'fit', 'release', 'low', 'ratings', 'fan', 'disapproval', 'definitely', 'buy']",Doctor Who: The Movie

I grew up, like a lot of people in the US, on Tom Baker.  I bought the movie to fill in a few gaps on the 8th Doctor and on the story line of the End of Time and the Master.  You see (very briefly) the transition from the 7th Doctor ( Sylverster McCoy) to Paul McGann.  The story is not bad.  It does fill in some gaps.  Some folks that might be pure British Dr Who fans might not like the movie,  but I liked it and am glad I bought it.  It was a nice way to get the series going again.  Now, if I can get some shows for the 12th Doctor - that would be brilliant!",4,Dr Who The Movie - The 8th Doctor,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,703,"['really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Classic', 'New', 'Dr', 'Who', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'seen', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'grew', 'up', 'lot', 'people', 'US', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'bought', 'movie', 'fill', 'few', 'gaps', '8th', 'Doctor', 'story', 'line', 'End', 'Time', 'Master', 'see', 'very', 'briefly', 'transition', '7th', 'Doctor', 'Sylverster', 'McCoy', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'fill', 'gaps', 'folks', 'might', 'be', 'pure', 'British', 'Dr', 'Who', 'fans', 'might', 'not', 'movie', 'liked', 'am', 'glad', 'bought', 'was', 'nice', 'way', 'get', 'series', 'going', 'again', 'Now', 'can', 'get', 'shows', '12th', 'Doctor', 'would', 'be', 'brilliant']",Doctor Who: The Movie

""Doctor Who: The Movie"" was an attempt to revive the BBC TV franchise for both American and British audiences after the series run out of steam in the 1980's. While flawed with a script that tries to do too much (be a pilot for those who don't know the series, Americanize the story/character a bit and craft an entertaining TV movies that long time fans could also enjoy)and features enough plot holes for the Tardis to fly through, ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" succeeds because of the charming performance of Paul McGann. It's too bad this pilot didn't get picked up because McGann is marvelous (although he has quite a bit different interpretation compared to his predecessors)in the role and I have the feeling the series would have improved.While transporting the remains of his nemesis The Master, the Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) crashes his sabotaged Tardis in San Francisco in 1999. Shot as he leaves the Tardis, The Doctor ends up in the hospital where Dr. Grace Holloway (Daphne Ashbrook)tries to save his life causing the Doctor to regenerate (Paul McGann). The Master takes over the body of a paramedic (Eric Roberts)with a new goal--to take the Doctor's body because that's the only way he can survive.Watch for a very clever reference to Tom Baker's Doctor.While not the best Doctor Who movie I've seen, it's far from the worst and a marketed improvement over some of the ones that aired when Sylvester McCoy or Colin Baker ""inhabited"" the role in the 1980's. That said, you'll either like the film and be willing to over look the flawed script by Matthew Vaughn (""The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones"", ""The Emperor's New Groove)the direction is fairly solid by Geoffrey Sax (""White Noise"")keeping the story moving along at a nice pace. The main flaw here is that the Doctor who does quite a bit of detecting in the show does little here primarily running around.The digital visual effects look dated but otherwise the production values (particularly for the redesigned interior of the Tardis)look quite nice (the TV film had a budget of $5 million MUCH bigger than anything the original series ever had).The DVD transfer looks good although it comes with some problems; the darker scenes tend to bury detail in murkiness but colors look quite good. It's a pity we don't have a Blu-ray transfer of this but, I suspect, this was probably assembled on video. It would require a complete rescan/reassembly of the original film elements for the film to truly benefit from a high def transfer.Audio sounds terrific with a nice, robust stereo mix.The special features will wow most fans. We get visual effects reels produced prior to production; we also get a featurette ""The Seven Year Hitch"" (titled because of the seven year hiatus until the TV movie)with producer Phillip Seagal detailing his efforts to ""regenerate"" The Doctor.""The Doctor's Strange Love"" focuses on how the TV movie has caught on with some members of the Who audience. ""The Wilderness Years"" details the books written that kept the character of The Doctor alive while the show was on hiatus for a decade. We also get ""Tomorrow's Times"" which focuses on the press coverage when McGann was announced as the new Doctor.Two commentary tracks one with the director (which has long periods of silence)and one featuring actors McCoy and McGann are both interesting--the latter is quite lively. Nicholas Briggs moderates the discussion and trio play well of each other.Although ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" isn't perfect it IS entertaining and features a charismatic performance by McGann (who really should have been considered for another chance to play the Doctor or at least a cameo in the rebooted series for a regeneration sequence).I'd suggest Whovians give it a chance. Is it a great TV movie? No but it IS entertaining and even in its cheesy moments it's fun.",3,Much maligned attempt to reboot Doctor Who entertaining primarily due to McGann's performance,1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,3912,"['cat', 'nine', 'lives', 'Luckily', 'fans', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'time', 'traveler', 'many', 'more', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Movie', 'was', 'attempt', 'revive', 'BBC', 'TV', 'franchise', 'American', 'British', 'audiences', 'series', 'run', 'steam', '1980', 'flawed', 'script', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'pilot', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'series', 'Americanize', 'story/character', 'bit', 'craft', 'entertaining', 'TV', 'movies', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'could', 'also', 'enjoy', 'enough', 'plot', 'holes', 'Tardis', 'fly', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Movie', 'charming', 'performance', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'too', 'bad', 'pilot', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'McGann', 'marvelous', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'interpretation', 'compared', 'predecessors', 'role', 'have', 'feeling', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'improved.While', 'transporting', 'remains', 'nemesis', 'Master', 'Doctor', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'sabotaged', 'Tardis', 'San', 'Francisco', '1999', 'Tardis', 'Doctor', 'up', 'hospital', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Grace', 'Holloway', 'Daphne', 'Ashbrook', 'save', 'life', 'causing', 'Doctor', 'regenerate', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'Master', 'body', 'paramedic', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'new', 'goal', 'take', 'Doctor', 'body', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'survive.Watch', 'very', 'clever', 'reference', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Doctor.While', 'not', 'best', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'worst', 'marketed', 'improvement', 'ones', 'aired', 'when', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'inhabited', 'role', '1980', 'said', ""'ll"", 'film', 'be', 'willing', 'look', 'flawed', 'script', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'Adventures', 'Young', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', 'direction', 'fairly', 'solid', 'Geoffrey', 'Sax', 'White', 'Noise', 'keeping', 'story', 'moving', 'along', 'nice', 'pace', 'main', 'flaw', 'here', 'Doctor', 'who', 'quite', 'bit', 'detecting', 'show', 'little', 'here', 'primarily', 'running', 'around.The', 'digital', 'visual', 'effects', 'look', 'dated', 'otherwise', 'production', 'values', 'particularly', 'redesigned', 'interior', 'Tardis', 'look', 'quite', 'nice', 'TV', 'film', 'had', 'budget', '5', 'million', 'MUCH', 'bigger', 'anything', 'original', 'series', 'ever', 'had', '.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'good', 'problems', 'darker', 'scenes', 'tend', 'bury', 'detail', 'murkiness', 'colors', 'look', 'quite', 'good', 'pity', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'suspect', 'was', 'probably', 'assembled', 'video', 'would', 'require', 'complete', 'rescan/reassembly', 'original', 'film', 'elements', 'film', 'truly', 'benefit', 'high', 'def', 'transfer.Audio', 'terrific', 'nice', 'robust', 'stereo', 'mix.The', 'special', 'features', 'will', 'wow', 'most', 'fans', 'get', 'visual', 'effects', 'reels', 'produced', 'prior', 'production', 'also', 'get', 'featurette', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Hitch', 'titled', 'because', 'seven', 'year', 'hiatus', 'TV', 'movie', 'producer', 'Phillip', 'Seagal', 'detailing', 'efforts', 'regenerate', 'Doctor', 'Doctor', 'Strange', 'Love', 'how', 'TV', 'movie', 'caught', 'members', 'Who', 'audience', 'Wilderness', 'Years', 'details', 'books', 'written', 'kept', 'character', 'Doctor', 'alive', 'show', 'was', 'hiatus', 'decade', 'also', 'get', 'Tomorrow', 'Times', 'press', 'coverage', 'when', 'McGann', 'was', 'announced', 'new', 'Doctor.Two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'director', 'long', 'periods', 'silence', 'one', 'featuring', 'actors', 'McCoy', 'McGann', 'are', 'interesting', 'latter', 'quite', 'lively', 'Nicholas', 'Briggs', 'discussion', 'trio', 'play', 'well', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Movie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'entertaining', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'McGann', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'chance', 'play', 'Doctor', 'least', 'cameo', 'rebooted', 'series', 'regeneration', 'sequence', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'Whovians', 'give', 'chance', 'great', 'TV', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'even', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'fun']",Doctor Who: The Movie
