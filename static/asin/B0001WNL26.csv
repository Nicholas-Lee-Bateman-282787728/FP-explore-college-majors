The sharpness, clarity, and color can be breathtaking.When my son and I saw the small-frame sample clips on the ANIMUSIC website, we knew we had to order the DVD. We didn't expect ANIMUSIC to look like a Pixar feature, but when it arrived, the video quality was a real letdown.We tried the ANIMUSIC DVD on three devices:_ A standalone DVD player with a 25"" TV_ A portable PC with a 1024x768 LCD display and average graphics processor_ A fast desktop PC with a 1280x1024 LCD display and fast graphics cardOn each, the video looked as though it was recorded from an analog source, like a videotape, rather than a digital one. During pans, the edges of objects visibly pixilated. The colors were dull. The picture was fuzzy and showed the ""halos"" characteristic of highly-compressed JPG images, leaving surfaces and textures unrealistic-looking. (If I didn't know better, I'd wonder if they recorded it by pointing a videocam at a monitor, as in ""Tron,"" Disney's pioneering 1982 feature.)Producing 3D animation is very time-consuming, even with powerful equipment. Perhaps Wayne Lytle had to use a lower resolution to speed up his rendering time (to meet distribution deadlines?). Or maybe he was limited by his production environment. Or maybe the DVD was just poorly mastered. For whatever reason, ANIMUSIC is NOT digital-quality video---not even close.I agree that ANIMUSIC's concept and animation are ingenious, and the music rocks. That makes it all the sadder that the DVD wasn't produced with more care.",3,"Ingenious work---but, sadly, poor video quality",1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,1595,"['Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'high-quality', 'computer-animated', 'movie', 'high-resolution', 'display', 'sharpness', 'clarity', 'color', 'can', 'be', 'breathtaking.When', 'son', 'saw', 'small-frame', 'sample', 'clips', 'ANIMUSIC', 'website', 'knew', 'had', 'order', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'ANIMUSIC', 'look', 'Pixar', 'feature', 'when', 'arrived', 'video', 'quality', 'was', 'real', 'letdown.We', 'tried', 'ANIMUSIC', 'DVD', 'three', 'devices', '_', 'standalone', 'DVD', 'player', '25', 'TV_', 'A', 'portable', 'PC', '1024x768', 'LCD', 'display', 'average', 'graphics', 'processor_', 'fast', 'desktop', 'PC', '1280x1024', 'LCD', 'display', 'fast', 'graphics', 'cardOn', 'video', 'looked', 'was', 'recorded', 'analog', 'source', 'videotape', 'rather', 'digital', 'one', 'pans', 'edges', 'objects', 'visibly', 'pixilated', 'colors', 'were', 'dull', 'picture', 'was', 'fuzzy', 'showed', 'halos', 'characteristic', 'highly-compressed', 'JPG', 'images', 'leaving', 'surfaces', 'unrealistic-looking', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', ""'d"", 'wonder', 'recorded', 'pointing', 'videocam', 'monitor', 'Tron', 'Disney', 'pioneering', '1982', 'feature', 'Producing', '3D', 'animation', 'very', 'time-consuming', 'even', 'powerful', 'equipment', 'Perhaps', 'Wayne', 'Lytle', 'had', 'use', 'lower', 'resolution', 'speed', 'up', 'rendering', 'time', 'meet', 'distribution', 'deadlines', 'maybe', 'was', 'limited', 'production', 'environment', 'maybe', 'DVD', 'was', 'just', 'poorly', 'mastered', 'reason', 'ANIMUSIC', 'NOT', 'digital-quality', 'video', '-not', 'even', 'close.I', 'agree', 'ANIMUSIC', 'concept', 'animation', 'are', 'ingenious', 'music', 'rocks', 'sadder', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'produced', 'more', 'care']",Animusic

Animusic is computer-animated music and it is something any fan of music or animation or any form of art for that matter can enjoy. This is how music itself if portrayed as animated backgrounds, settings and instruments. This one of those DVD's you can't pull away from, otherwise you are going to miss something pretty cool (NOTE: Don't even think of blinking while watching `Pipe Dream'). There are 7 tracks each unique in its own sound and style, so there is something for everyone. From rock, to jazz to acoustic `Animusic' is sheer bliss. When I first saw it was simply amazed. The music is great the sequences are a great spectacle and even though there are no vocals some of the ""characters"" really leave an impression.

But the computer is just a production tool, like an artist's brush, and the final product is what counts. That product is gorgeous, and covers a wide range of sensibilities. 'Stick Figures' features likable robotic characters. Most of the other pieces, including 'Pipe Dream' and especially 'Drum Machine' have a more industrial feel, like the offspring of symphony orchestra and an automated assembly line. 'Harmonic Voltage' takes the science fiction look even farther.The music really makes this stand out. It's not just something to go along with the clever gadgets. The MIDI control tracks literally drive the motion just as they drive the sound - with remarkable cleverness to make sure that the cymbal or drum rotates into position just when it needs to be played. In fact, at lease one of these compositions, 'Aqua Harp,' has taken on a life of its own. A little searching at YouTube shows more than one human-played version of the very enjoyable tune.Extras help, too. The seven shorts each offer preliminary sketches of the visual concepts and other material showing how the imagery comes together. Informative director's notes help viewers appreciate the behind-the-scenes work, and add an eighth, earlier piece to the collection.

Being a musician myself and a computer graphics enthusiast myself, I would say Lytle and Crognale have created an ingenious product of superior quality and state-of-the-art.  I remember watching computer graphics in the early 90's on the big screens at the local discotheques, and was very impressed then.  But, unlike any of the New Age composers like Patrick O'Hearn or James Reynolds or Enigma, I prefer to see these imaginary instruments MIDI synced up to the original compositions of Lytle, rather than just elaborate computer graphics with un-MIDI-synced background music.  It is far more interesting to watch the extreme accuracy of these imaginary instruments playing at the correct intervals which reflect the true music.  In my opinion, Lytle and Crognale are music/computer geniuses, and I have definitely become a big fan of Animusic, a new innovation in music and video coupling.
