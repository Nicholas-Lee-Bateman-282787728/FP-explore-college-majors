We all get that feeling, of missing something, the one that we have - long after the element of being young has passed. In (The Kid), Bruce Willis plays Russ, a person who has tricked himself into believing that he has a happy life. In reality he in nothing but a jerk. He makes his living by ripping down others to a level beneath themselves: in short he is an &quot;appearance consultant&quot;. He makes a living by telling you that you look bad, and you can always look better. Then one evening, an odd miracle happens. Rusty (Willis) gets a visit from his younger self. At first he tries to make the kid disappear with heavy medication; that doesn't work. It's not a dream or a psychological breakdown, it's him!Young rusty can whip out opinions just as fast as him, and he don't like it. Somehow they have to put there heads together and figure out how to fix the mess. Do they get him back? Fix both of their lives? Get a dog?

564404,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000524E4,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Okay, here is another gushing review for a Bruce Willis movie (and performance).  Seriously, I don't understand why this guy doesn't at least have a few more Golden Globe nominations.  I mean, the fact that he has turned out consistently great work for years and has nothing to show for it is rather insulting.  This decade alone he has given us `The Whole Nine Yards', `Bandits', `Unbreakable', `Tears of the Sun', `Hostage', `Sin City', `Hart's War' and `The Kid'.  You couple that with his incredible work in films like `The Sixth Sense', `The Story of Us', `The Jackal', `Pulp Fiction', `Twelve Monkeys', `Die Hard', `Death Becomes Her' and `In Country' and the Academy should be EMBARRASSED that they have not nominated him ONCE for anything.I'm not saying that he should have been nominated for `The Kid', but this is yet another consistently spot on performance that he has added to his r&eacute;sum&eacute;.In `The Kid', Bruce plays Russ Duritz, a hard-as-nails image consultant who is obviously guarded and uses sarcasm and a sense of selfishness to protect himself from everyone around him.  When a pudgy little kid plops himself in Russ's living room, things start to change.  This little kid happens to be Russ (well, Rusty) and for some magical reason he has traveled to the future.  Apparently this has been done to remind Russ of all that he has forgotten and hopefully save him before he manages to ruin what's left of his life.  As they spend time together though, it is apparent that Rusty needs Russ just as much as Russ needs Rusty.Insert teary-eyes here.The film has Disney written all over it, and the saccharine quality is definitely there, but what is remarkable about this film is that it NEVER overdoes it, which could have been so easy to do.  Instead, this film has a heart that feels genuine, which is not what I expected and it still takes me by surprise each and every time I watch this.  Sure, the ending and the eventual character overhaul is a bit schmaltzy, but he message this film carries is delivered with the right amount of genuine and heartfelt sincerity to make it totally work!The acting is a total plus here, with beautifully crafted performances by everyone involved.  Bruce is witty, charming (in that total jerky kind of way) and suave.  Spencer Breslin is cute, awkward and sincere.  Emily Mortimer is kind, endearing and alluring.  Lily Tomlin is hysterical, sympathetic and memorable.  Yes, they all come together to complete one another and deliver a wonderful (family friendly) ride.I just want to hug this movie.And for the record, I'd personally nominate Bruce Willis for his performances in `Die Hard', `Pulp Fiction' and `The Jackal'.  If I were a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press (who hold the Golden Globes) then I'd have listed him on my ballot for those three films as well as for `Death Becomes Her', `The Whole Nine Yards' and `The Story of Us'.  I still consider his performance in `The Sixth Sense' to be his finest to date, but 1999 is such a crowded year (dramatically) and I can't bring myself to knock Norton, Pitt, Spacey, Damon or CROWE off my ballot.  If I nominated six then Willis would be on it.Not like you really cared to know all that.:-D",5,A great film for the whole family!,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,3220,"['Okay', 'here', 'gushing', 'review', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'movie', 'performance', 'Seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'guy', ""n't"", 'least', 'have', 'few', 'more', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominations', 'mean', 'fact', 'turned', 'out', 'consistently', 'great', 'work', 'years', 'nothing', 'show', 'rather', 'insulting', 'decade', 'alone', 'given', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'Bandits', 'Unbreakable', 'Tears', 'Sun', 'Hostage', 'Sin', 'City', 'Hart', 'War', 'Kid', 'couple', 'incredible', 'work', 'films', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Story', 'Us', 'Jackal', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Twelve', 'Monkeys', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Her', 'Country', 'Academy', 'should', 'be', 'EMBARRASSED', 'have', 'not', 'nominated', 'ONCE', 'anything.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Kid', 'yet', 'consistently', 'spot', 'performance', 'added', 'r', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Kid', 'Bruce', 'Russ', 'Duritz', 'hard-as-nails', 'image', 'consultant', 'who', 'obviously', 'guarded', 'sarcasm', 'sense', 'selfishness', 'protect', 'everyone', 'When', 'pudgy', 'little', 'kid', 'Russ', 'living', 'room', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'little', 'kid', 'be', 'Russ', 'well', 'Rusty', 'magical', 'reason', 'traveled', 'future', 'Apparently', 'been', 'done', 'remind', 'Russ', 'forgotten', 'hopefully', 'save', 'ruin', 'what', 'left', 'life', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'apparent', 'Rusty', 'Russ', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Russ', 'Rusty.Insert', 'teary-eyes', 'here.The', 'film', 'Disney', 'written', 'saccharine', 'quality', 'definitely', 'there', 'what', 'remarkable', 'film', 'NEVER', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easy', 'do', 'Instead', 'film', 'heart', 'genuine', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'still', 'surprise', 'time', 'watch', 'Sure', 'ending', 'eventual', 'character', 'overhaul', 'bit', 'schmaltzy', 'film', 'delivered', 'right', 'amount', 'genuine', 'heartfelt', 'sincerity', 'make', 'totally', 'work', 'acting', 'total', 'plus', 'here', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'performances', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Bruce', 'witty', 'charming', 'total', 'jerky', 'kind', 'way', 'suave', 'Spencer', 'Breslin', 'cute', 'awkward', 'sincere', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'kind', 'endearing', 'alluring', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'hysterical', 'sympathetic', 'memorable', 'Yes', 'come', 'together', 'complete', 'one', 'deliver', 'wonderful', 'family', 'friendly', 'ride.I', 'just', 'want', 'hug', 'movie.And', 'record', ""'d"", 'personally', 'nominate', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'performances', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Jackal', 'were', 'member', 'Hollywood', 'Foreign', 'Press', 'who', 'hold', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'then', ""'d"", 'have', 'listed', 'ballot', 'three', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Her', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'Story', 'Us', 'still', 'consider', 'performance', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'be', 'finest', 'date', '1999', 'crowded', 'year', 'dramatically', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'knock', 'Norton', 'Pitt', 'Spacey', 'Damon', 'CROWE', 'ballot', 'nominated', 'six', 'then', 'Willis', 'would', 'be', 'it.Not', 'really', 'cared', 'know', '-D']",N/A

564416,A3FXT4UPI30K7S,B0000524E4,"Cynthia Sue Larson ""best-selling author""","[27, 29]","THE KID tells a story about a workaholic man, Russ Duritz, (Bruce Willis) who thinks his life is humming along just great, yet who claims the questionable distinction of being called a jerk several times by many different people in the same day.  Full of his own sense of self-importance, Russ would prefer to spend time with his wealthy clients with questionable ethics than with his own parents. Things change overnight when Russ finds himself face-to-face with his chubby, long-forgotten childhood self, Rusty (Spencer Breslin).This movie is laugh-out-loud funny in several places, including one hysterical scene in which Russ (Bruce Willis) asks his secretary, played by Lily Tomlin, to help make young Rusty vanish.  As Russ begins to accept that Rusty will be with him for some time, he begins to take a closer look at his life.  Little by little, Russ starts to find value in a past that he had long forgotten and repressed, and his love life even benefits from this introspection.While the supernatural/mysterious nature of what is happening is never fully explained, the significance of it becomes clearer by the end of the film -- yet this film never for a minute bogs down in sappy sentimentality or false emotions.

Not to say that the idea behind 'The Kid' didn't interest me it's just that I'm not too big into Disney movies.  Regardless, Bruce led me to it so I must follow.  I have to admit, upon walking out of the theater I was touched in a way not to many movies touch me.  I wasn't emotional because it was depressing and I wasn't outraged because it was upsetting.  I was personally touched at the beautiful message this film conveys.Bruce Willis (The Sixth Sense) plays Russ, a cynical tyrant sort-of-speak, a man that is so uncomfortable with affection that he rejects it even from the ones that love him the most.  He's so deeply haunted by his childhood that he hides behind a rough exterior in order never to be hurt again.  That's all until he meets himself.  I should say he meets his 8-year-old self.Throughout the remainder of the film the two Russ's try and figure out why Rusty (Spencer Breslin) was sent to Russ (Willis).  Uncovering that reason will eventually lead to Russ coming to grips with his life and his past and hopefully making a much needed adjustment, whatever that may involve.  The supporting cast is wonderful as well, Lily Tomlin (A Prairie Home Companion) perfectly casted as the witty sarcastic secretary Janet, and Emily Mortimer (Match Point) is delightful as Amy, the friend and co-worker who falls in love with the man Russ could be.

But it turns out to be an eight-year-old boy named Rusty (Spencer Breslin) who, somehow, some way, is Duritz. Duritz has spent his whole life rejecting his childhood and teaching others how to be something they?re not ? you guessed it, he?s an image consultant. And that?s the part I liked best about this movie; Willis makes the script work so very well. I truly, honestly believe no one could have nailed this role the way Willis did ? he convinced me that if he were to leave acting and become a real life image consultant, he would be the best in the business.Continuing on, Duritz is determined to make the whining snot-nosed kid (himself a few sizes smaller) go away. But when it becomes obvious that?s not going to happen, Russ is left with no choice but to hang with the kid until he can figure out why this strange and impossible event is occurring. It is a wild ride when the two just-a-like-but-completely-opposite duo hang out.There are a lot of fun twist and turns in this movie.I believe the cinematography in this movie is also top-notch.I say ignore the bad reviews.

The acting is superb by everyone in the cast, and the characters are very likeable (even when they're acting like a jerk) as well as very interesting.In this movie, 8-year-old Rusty learns that there's more to success than having a lady and a dog named Chester hanging around the house.  40-year-old Rusty learns that his key to happiness is staring him in the face nearly everyday, if only he is willing to look at her the same way she looks at him.  They both learn simultaneously that they're worth a heck of a lot more than their self esteem allows.  Of course, they probably would not have learned these things had they not learned them from each other, as boy-Rusty and man-Rusty meet up and one gets to know his inner-child while the other gets to know his inner-adult.What's so great about Rusty if he's &quot;girless and dogless&quot; at age 40?  Plenty if he can learn to respect himself for what he is instead of what he tries to be; plenty if he learns the value of the people that have been placed in his life; plenty if he learns to love the people around him.This movie is a cinematic slap in the face and wake-up call for people who tend to think &quot;Wow, I'm [insert age]-years-old, and I haven't even [insert self-pity complaint] or I still don't even have a [other self-pity complaint]!&quot;  This film helps remind you of the things and people you've been blessed with, and will more than likely make you take a closer look at life.Most of all it's (unashamedly) a great feel-good movie!",5,Holy Smokes!

564425,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B0000524E4,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 0]","""The Kid"" is a sappy but easy to like film that pretends to be a comedy for kids when it really deals with an adult topic that is beyond the comprehension of its target audience.  Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is days from his 40th birthday.  His life is hardly full of mirthful joy.  He is a dour, unhappy, impatient grouch who is brilliant at his work and alienates everyone he meets.  Suddenly an eight-year-old boy appears, who he realizes is himself as a child, a part of his life that he has effectively blocked from memory.  The interaction between him and his former self brings about an understanding of the forces that are affecting his life today and fosters a transformation to a happier Russ.The story touches on heavy, soul-searching ideas in a very lighthearted way, which makes Audrey Wells' (""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"", ""George of the Jungle"") script innovative and fresh.  Its deeper implications are certainly far over the head of Disney age kids, but hit home with their parents.  However, there is enough childlike silliness to keep the kids entertained while their parents ponder the true meaning of the film.After his previous project, the heavy handed ""Instinct"", Director John Turteltaub shows amazing adaptive ability in being able to switch to a lighthearted comedy with equal effectiveness.  His direction of the actors is terrific, and he is able to create scenes that are appealing to children, but not so juvenile that it puts off the adults.  In addition, his 50's period schoolyard scenes are very accurate as to costumes, props and feel of the period.Bruce Willis shows his versatility, giving a terrific comedic performance, unafraid to scream and stomp around like a kid to achieve the proper effect.  Once again, he displays extraordinary chemistry with a child actor, making it seem more as if they are playing together than acting.  Spencer Breslin is cherubic and believable as the kid in his first feature film.  Lily Tomlin adds her wry comedy to the mix and is perfect as Russ's overwrought assistant.  Jean Smart also deserves special mention, giving a sensitive performance as the stranger on the plane who becomes Russ's confidant.This film has a lot to recommend it.  It is entertaining and funny and it has a deeper message ensconced within the childish mischief.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is an enjoyable film that isn't just for kids.",4,Not just for kids,982108800,"02 14, 2001",2001,2385,"['Kid', 'sappy', 'easy', 'like', 'film', 'be', 'comedy', 'kids', 'when', 'really', 'adult', 'topic', 'comprehension', 'target', 'audience', 'Russ', 'Duritz', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'days', '40th', 'birthday', 'life', 'hardly', 'full', 'mirthful', 'joy', 'dour', 'unhappy', 'impatient', 'grouch', 'who', 'brilliant', 'work', 'everyone', 'Suddenly', 'eight-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'child', 'part', 'life', 'effectively', 'blocked', 'memory', 'interaction', 'former', 'self', 'understanding', 'forces', 'are', 'affecting', 'life', 'today', 'fosters', 'transformation', 'happier', 'Russ.The', 'story', 'touches', 'heavy', 'soul-searching', 'ideas', 'very', 'lighthearted', 'way', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'Truth', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'George', 'Jungle', 'script', 'innovative', 'fresh', 'deeper', 'implications', 'are', 'certainly', 'far', 'head', 'Disney', 'age', 'kids', 'hit', 'home', 'parents', 'However', 'enough', 'childlike', 'silliness', 'keep', 'kids', 'entertained', 'parents', 'ponder', 'true', 'meaning', 'film.After', 'previous', 'project', 'heavy', 'handed', 'Instinct', 'Director', 'John', 'Turteltaub', 'amazing', 'adaptive', 'ability', 'being', 'able', 'switch', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'equal', 'effectiveness', 'direction', 'actors', 'terrific', 'able', 'create', 'scenes', 'are', 'appealing', 'children', 'not', 'so', 'juvenile', 'adults', 'addition', '50', 'period', 'schoolyard', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'accurate', 'costumes', 'props', 'feel', 'period.Bruce', 'Willis', 'versatility', 'giving', 'terrific', 'comedic', 'performance', 'unafraid', 'scream', 'stomp', 'kid', 'achieve', 'proper', 'effect', 'Once', 'again', 'extraordinary', 'chemistry', 'child', 'actor', 'making', 'seem', 'more', 'are', 'playing', 'together', 'acting', 'Spencer', 'Breslin', 'cherubic', 'believable', 'kid', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'wry', 'comedy', 'mix', 'perfect', 'Russ', 'overwrought', 'assistant', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'also', 'special', 'mention', 'giving', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'stranger', 'plane', 'who', 'Russ', 'confidant.This', 'film', 'lot', 'recommend', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'deeper', 'message', 'ensconced', 'childish', 'mischief', 'rated', '8/10', 'enjoyable', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'kids']",N/A

I decided - ""I want to watch as much of her stuff as possible"" - mostly because I trusted to be delighted....especially given my faint recollection of this Bruce Willis-coming-to-much-better-adulthood (really a coming of age in a way beyond the usual-bursting into adulthood chronologically).Bruce Willis grasps his character, Russ Duritz, very well - he is splendidly uptight and horribly candid, though you know he must have some sort of heart beating way deep inside from the people he attracts to him. We learn there is some sort of bad-history with his father from an early scene, we are not sure what is up with that, and we also learn Russ knows how to surround himself with remarkable women.He even manages to attract a newly hired Los Angeles anchorwoman neatly played by Jean Smart as his seatmate in an airplane.  (He dryly states he won't consider the cosmic influences that brought them together, yet later he seeks Smart's character out for advice when he finally gets that he is actually NOT in control of the universe.)Spencer Breslin is everywhere these days, but his face was fresh and new when this movie was made. He played the mini-Russ role believably. I wanted to climb through the TV several times to give him a cuddle.  Thankfully, the adult Russ' love interest, Amy, filled in for me in my absence. *Smile*Woven into the movie are many brilliant messages - they don't clunk the viewer over the head like a sermon and yet for the alert, open viewer - they come through loud and clear.  Audrey Wells writing was crisp, laugh out loud funny yet also circled around for many deep moments in the truth-filled messages sprinkled throughout.When you watch the DVD - watch the Moon Scenes - they were classic, although at first shot you might not think a thing about them.  My daughter was delighted in the end, when there was a mini-Science fact as well.This multi-layered, textured movie is one that deserves multiple viewing.

Within moments Audrey Wells sharp writing, which she displayed in her underrated script for The Truth About Cats and Dogs, slaps the astute audience member across the face.  The kids won't pick up on the sarcasm, but fans of older, classic films will enjoy the crackling, back-and-forth exchanges Willis gets into with just about every person.  It was a pleasure to see Willis doing something amusing for once and avoiding that whispering, deep-thinker bull he's been trying in dogs like Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense.So the story.  Simply put, Russ, Willis' character, is a surly, unrepentant intellectual bully who loves his job and has little time for anyone or anything.  Enter Rusty, his 8 year old self, brought to the current world through thankfully unexplained means.  Little Rusty and Russ go through the usual plot devices, but it's Wells' sharp dialogue and the fine acting by all parties that keeps this movie from dipping into the usual Hollywood boredom.  Naturally, Russ changes and evolves, yaddaya, yaddaya, yaddaya.  What do you expect, it's a kids movie?  Regardless, the film is quite strong until an unbelievably bad ending involving three Russes (or is that Russi?).

I imagine that 99.9% of us don't wind up in life at the place we dreamed of as a kid. I have a theory that most children instinctively know at a very early age what their purpose in life might be. Because our society is set up in a rather ruthless and mercenary way, most of us get knocked off track. This inability to be what we hoped we might have been can be a source of much unhappiness and frustration.Russ Durwitz [Bruce Willis] has most the things in life that people insist should bring fulfillment. He is his own boss. He makes a lot of money, drives a Porsche, owns an expensive home in a posh neighborhood, and is very attractive to women. As an image consultant, he gets to travel a lot, always in first class. His assistant [Emily Mortimer] is a beautiful and talented young woman who is also in love with him. His secretary [Lili Tomlin] is one of those efficient and unflappable pros who can take care of any situation. Yet something is wrong with Russ. He is moody, sarcastic and rude. He avoids his family like the plague and has blotted out almost all memories of his childhood. No one can get close to him. Russ is a totally frustrated man, although he denies it. One day he comes home to find a young boy [Spencer Breslin] in his house. Outraged, he chases the lad out. But the kid keeps reappearing. Soon, a very confused Russ discovers that the child is himself at age eight. How this happens is never made clear, but the reason he has appeared is to remind Russ what he was like as a child, what his dreams were and what happened to make them disappear.This could have been an engrossing and enlightening tale, but in the hands of director Jon 'Churn 'Em Out' Turteltaub, it winds up as a mere confection, a pleasant enough way to while away a couple of hours. Disney sold this movie as one for children, but its fairly slow pace makes it more suitable for adults, who, in turn, may find it too predictable and sugary. Bruce Willis is very good, but then he always is. Willis has made many movies I do not like, but I've always liked him. As young Russ, Spencer Breslin is less than successful. The producers thought it would be funny if the kid were as loud and pushy as the adult Russ. At first he is funny, but he later becomes irritating. I doubt even someone as talented as Haley Joel Osment could make this child lovable.The Kid is far from the worst movie out these days. It has its moments, especially in the few minutes Lili Tomlin is on screen. It is fun to watch Willis' character trying to cope with his young self. It is a movie with a happy ending. It is also one that is seen and then happily forgotten.",3,"Pleasant, diverting, ultimately forgettable",1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2768,"['like', 'ideas', 'presented', 'Kid', '[', 'AKA', 'Disney', 'Kid', ']', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'imagine', '99.9', '%', 'do', ""n't"", 'wind', 'up', 'life', 'place', 'dreamed', 'kid', 'have', 'theory', 'most', 'children', 'instinctively', 'know', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'what', 'purpose', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'society', 'set', 'up', 'rather', 'ruthless', 'mercenary', 'way', 'most', 'get', 'knocked', 'off', 'track', 'inability', 'be', 'what', 'hoped', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'can', 'be', 'source', 'much', 'unhappiness', 'frustration.Russ', 'Durwitz', '[', 'Bruce', 'Willis', ']', 'most', 'things', 'life', 'people', 'insist', 'should', 'bring', 'fulfillment', 'own', 'boss', 'lot', 'money', 'Porsche', 'expensive', 'home', 'posh', 'neighborhood', 'very', 'attractive', 'women', 'image', 'consultant', 'travel', 'lot', 'always', 'first', 'class', 'assistant', '[', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', ']', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'love', 'secretary', '[', 'Lili', 'Tomlin', ']', 'one', 'efficient', 'unflappable', 'pros', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'situation', 'something', 'wrong', 'Russ', 'moody', 'sarcastic', 'rude', 'family', 'plague', 'blotted', 'out', 'almost', 'memories', 'childhood', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'close', 'Russ', 'totally', 'frustrated', 'man', 'One', 'day', 'home', 'find', 'young', 'boy', '[', 'Spencer', 'Breslin', ']', 'house', 'Outraged', 'lad', 'out', 'kid', 'reappearing', 'Soon', 'very', 'confused', 'Russ', 'discovers', 'child', 'age', 'eight', 'How', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'reason', 'appeared', 'remind', 'Russ', 'what', 'was', 'child', 'what', 'dreams', 'were', 'what', 'happened', 'make', 'disappear.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'engrossing', 'enlightening', 'tale', 'hands', 'director', 'Jon', ""'Churn"", 'Out', 'Turteltaub', 'up', 'mere', 'confection', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'way', 'while', 'away', 'couple', 'hours', 'Disney', 'sold', 'movie', 'one', 'children', 'fairly', 'slow', 'pace', 'more', 'suitable', 'adults', 'who', 'turn', 'may', 'find', 'too', 'predictable', 'sugary', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'very', 'good', 'then', 'always', 'Willis', 'made', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'not', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'young', 'Russ', 'Spencer', 'Breslin', 'less', 'successful', 'producers', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'kid', 'were', 'loud', 'pushy', 'adult', 'Russ', 'first', 'funny', 'later', 'irritating', 'doubt', 'even', 'someone', 'as', 'talented', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'could', 'make', 'child', 'lovable.The', 'Kid', 'far', 'worst', 'movie', 'days', 'moments', 'especially', 'few', 'minutes', 'Lili', 'Tomlin', 'screen', 'fun', 'watch', 'Willis', 'character', 'trying', 'cope', 'young', 'self', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'also', 'one', 'seen', 'then', 'happily', 'forgotten']",N/A

And how often these dreams are pushed aside as the practical side of the world takes hold of us. How we are changed due to events beyond our control as we grow up and how we are changed by decisions we make when we are children. We lose focus on what is important and instead run after things that seem important, while we lose ourselve in the process.The Kid is a smart movie that uses a child version of a 'successful' almost 40 year old Bruce Willis to show him what is important. It is a heartwarming movie that will make you laugh and maybe cry a little. In the end, hopefully it will make you think and reevaluate. Dreams are what makes us unique.

Sometimes it becomes a matter of merely facing the issue-- whatever it is-- but more often it becomes a matter of figuring out what happened in the first place, which can be a bit harder, especially if a good number of years have passed having relegated that source of darkness in the soul to the subconscious.  And though getting in touch with oneself is often a conundrum of monumental proportions, it&#65533;s a necessary step in order to allow, perhaps, that better person inside to emerge.  It&#65533;s just such a situation that is explored in &#65533;The Kid,&#65533; a heartwarming film directed by Jon Turteltaub and starring Bruce Willis as a successful but cynical businessman who has a lot to offer, if only he would give himself a chance; which is just what he gets through the magic of the cinema.Coming upon his fortieth birthday, Russ Duritz (Willis) has built a successful career as an image consultant, but he&#65533;s also built a wall around himself that keeps everybody out.  He&#65533;s perceived as a rather hard, shallow person, and he&#65533;s reached the point where he doesn&#65533;t even know who he really is himself anymore.  Not that he thinks about it too often.  He&#65533;s lived so long behind that hard, external facade that gets the job done that he doesn&#65533;t seem to care.  But it&#65533;s taken it&#65533;s toll.  He rejects his apparently loving and caring father, for example, but doesn&#65533;t understand why, nor does he ever stop to even consider why it is so; it&#65533;s gone on for so long it&#65533;s just the way it is.  End of story and move along.Then out of the blue one night, an eight-year-old kid named Rusty (Spencer Breslin) shows up at his house.  Rusty is about to turn nine, doesn&#65533;t know where he belongs and proceeds to turn Russ&#65533;s world upside down.  Because Rusty knows things he can&#65533;t possibly know.  Things that soon force Russ to take a step back and consider his life from a different perspective; things that open that channel that allows him to get in touch with himself at last, through Rusty-- a mere kid and a total stranger.  And as the story unfolds Russ discovers that Rusty is indeed a kid, but a total stranger?  Maybe not.  There&#65533;s just something about Rusty that is too familiar, and the kid simply knows too much.Turteltaub has taken a sensitive situation to which many will be able to relate, and examined it through the medium of fantasy/comedy/drama to deliver an affecting, touching resolution to a universal matter of the human heart.  In the same spirit of films like &#65533;It&#65533;s A Wonderful Life,&#65533; &#65533;Mr. Destiny&#65533; and the more recent &#65533;The Family Man,&#65533; he has used poetic license to peel away layers of cynicism and repressed feelings to get to the heart of the humanity that lives within us all, and he has done it successfully and to great effect.  In a world of fast-food and instant gratification, the story of Russ and Rusty is not unique; and it just may be that a film like this can become the impetus for resolution and communication between estranged parties in some cases.  Which, of course, would make this film more than mere entertainment, and thereby demonstrate the true power of the medium.As he proved with such films as &#65533;The Sixth Sense&#65533; and &#65533;Unbreakable,&#65533; there is much more to Bruce Willis than the action-figures he has created so well in so many other films (John McClane in &#65533;Die Hard,&#65533; for example).  Here he shows that he can tread that fine line between comedy and drama and make it work very effectively, which is no small feat.  He convincingly sells the hard-guy Russ at the beginning of the film, then just as convincingly sells the gradual transition and acceptance of a man who has for too long lived with a deception that has served to fool even himself.  It&#65533;s a solid, strong performance that makes Russ believable and allows the viewer to embrace the characters and the fantasy that is being played out, which ultimately is what makes the movie work.Breslin, meanwhile, gives a natural performance that makes Rusty an endearing and credible character.  He&#65533;s all boy and all kid, and because he&#65533;s so real it is easy to empathize with him, which in turn opens that inner door to Russ, as well.  And he really clicks with Willis (who as an actor is very generous with Breslin, giving him his own space and moments), and their scenes become alternately hilarious and extremely moving.The supporting cast includes Emily Mortimer (Amy), Lily Tomlin (Janet), Chi McBride (Kenny), Jean Smart (Deirdre) and Dana Ivy (Dr. Alexander).  In today&#65533;s world (or anytime, for that matter), it&#65533;s a treat to run across a film like &#65533;The Kid,&#65533; because it&#65533;s not only entertaining, but a reaffirmation of the good that resides within us all, hidden away in many cases as it may be.  Well crafted and acted, this is a positive, feel-good film that celebrates the best side of the human spirit and puts a smile on the face of humanity.  And that&#65533;s the magic of the movies.",4,Willis and Breslin Connect,999475200,"09 3, 2001",2001,5302,"['significant', 'emotional', 'event', 'can', 'have', 'far-reaching', 'lasting', 'effect',

564470,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000524E4,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""The Kid"" is an amusing variation on all those body-switch fantasy films such as ""Big"" and ""Like Father, Like Son"" which became so popular for a time in the 1980's.  In this case, it is Bruce Willis who stars as the grumpy older adult who, through some kind of miraculous intervention, is able to finally come to terms with his inner child - thereby rescuing himself from the emptiness of his emotionally cold, tragically loveless adult life.Russell M. Duritz is a successful image consultant so traumatized by being a picked-upon, bullied ""dweeb"" in his childhood that he has managed to block out virtually every memory, pleasant or unpleasant, of his scarred boyhood.  In his current life, Russell attempts to compensate for all his previous ""faults"" by becoming a career-driven, hardnosed cynic who is unable to connect with other human beings on anything close to a meaningful level.  Then, right on the eve of his epochal 40th birthday, a strange supernatural phenomenon occurs:  Russell is suddenly confronted by a mysterious, soon-to-be-8-year-old tyke who, it turns out, is actually Russell himself 32 years earlier.  As the relationship between Russell and Rusty deepens, the older Russell learns not only to reconnect with his own past, but to absorb all the lessons little Rusty has to offer - lessons that he, big Russell, in his race to adulthood, managed to forget along the way.""The Kid,"" despite the fact that it is based essentially on a one-joke premise, manages to remain fresh and entertaining for most of its running time thanks to a clever and witty script by Audrey Wells, breezy direction by Jon Turteltaub and, above all, first class performances by Bruce Willis and Spencer Breslin who, as Russell and Rusty, achieve a winning rapport in their many scenes together.  Happily, the filmmakers have, for the most part, resisted the temptation to over dramatize the fantasy elements of the scenario - which could easily have led to a great deal of lowbrow slapstick antics - preferring, instead, to let the scenes between the two main characters play themselves out with a quiet naturalness, thereby allowing us to penetrate to the basic human realities at the core.  Although the film does suffer a bit towards the end - becoming a tad more sentimental than is perhaps warranted - one appreciates the fact that the filmmakers have at least attempted to achieve something fairly profound with this lighthearted material.  Lily Tomlin, it should be noted, does a superb job as Russell's put-upon and harried assistant, who tries in vain to act as the voice of reason for her self-absorbed, conscienceless boss.""The Kid"" is not a ""great"" comedy and it never really soars like some of the better family films of recent years (""Toy Story 2,"" ""Shrek""), but it does provide plenty of laughs, some stellar performances and even a few insightful observations about human nature along the way.
