Nothing is dealt with in any depth.The first DVD suffers from the lack of film for the period. I'm sorry, but superimposing several stills of a performer on a stage to illustrate three different gestures over and over just doesn't cut it. You might as well read one of Ethan Mordden's Broadway history books and listen to a CD instead.We're shown more footage of performers in the second DVD, but it only whets your appetite. It's frustrating to see brief, incomplete clips of Ethel Waters and Ethel Merman, tremendously exciting both, and then move on to the next topic. Frankly, it would have been better to have compiled complete rare footage of the very best performances and have left it at that.By the end of the second DVD, I lost interest, so I'll defer to the others on this page about how the third DVD is.The only saving feature to this set: the extras.

845993,A3SHA4Y9DHEK39,B0002V7THY,Chad Oberholtzer,"[2, 2]","I'm a rather casual fan of Broadway musicals.  I've seen a handful of musicals in New York, own a handful of original cast recordings, have seen a bunch of touring, university, and high school musical productions, and have watched a number of film versions of famous musicals.  So, my review of this series is clearly shaped by my previous exposure to the world of Broadway.From this perspective, I found this PBS production to be utterly fascinating.  Of the six-part series, I basically knew nothing that was mentioned in the first three parts, other than a few names about which I knew nothing specific.  It was so interesting to learn about George Cohan, Florenz Ziegfeld, Fanny Brice, Bert Williams, and so many other stars from a bygone era.  I especially loved the archival footage, which showcased some amazing talents from so long ago.The final three parts featured dozens of musicals that I know, many that I have seen, several that I'd like to see, and a handful that were completely unfamiliar to me (if apparently rather important in the history of musical theatre).  Though this part was less earthshatteringly profound to me, I still appreciated gaining new perspective about particular aspects of how musicals are put on stage, including various collaborating teams, the role of producers, and the economic influences that shape the world of theatre.Obviously, this was a rather ambitious project and falls short in some inevitable ways.  The folks who produced this documentary had to be selective about what people, shows, and topics they covered, so it is not surprising that some important stuff was missed.  That's simply the result of covering 100 years of history in six hours.  And I agree with another reviewer that the series seemed to be rather Sondheim-heavy, but his interviews, quotes, and historical footage were definitely some of the most engaging, so it's no wonder that he was so prominently featured.  More important than these gripes, my biggest disappointment was the chronology of the series.  More specifically, the six parts were organized around topics rather than dates, which means that the events were often covered out of order.  As the storyline moved forward and backward in time, especially during the first several parts, this made it difficult to put the pieces together in their appropriate context.  This may not be an issue for Broadway experts, but as someone watching this series with limited knowledge, this production choice was rather jarring and confusing for me.These few frustrations notwithstanding, I really enjoyed this PBS series.  I learned a great deal about the history of Broadway musicals, was able to see some fabulous footage of classic moments on stage, was able to reminisce about some of my favorite shows, and gained a new-found appreciation for the wonder of the Broadway stage.

I was actually bored watching this.  The high production value is a plus.  But that cannot overcome its dull, monotonus and antiseptic handling of the subject.  Perhaps the producers - so overproduced it that they produced the life right out of it.  It's montonous, dull, repetitive and seems to have no soul.  It's ironic that subject matter with so much life and excitement could be presented in such a lifeless and downright boring manner.

It's narrated by Julie Andrews and contains selections from the top musicals and commentary by many of the leading actors, producers, directors, writers, and Broadway luminaries. I've viewed it several times. It is six hours long with three hours of additional interviews and a special section on ""Wicked.""It is divided into six one-hour episodes of chronological periods from 1893 to 2004. This time I concentrated on the last two eras: ""Tradition"" from 1957 to 1979, and ""Putting It Together"" from 1980 to 2004. In 1957 the great breakthrough musical was ""West Side Story"" with an inspired team of creative talents behind it. Broadway always has and always will keep breaking the mold. What keeps it alive is its great ability to change and evolve. Old timers who fail to see that will always say B'way is dead or dying, but it hasn't croaked yet and is making more money than ever.As of September 2010 currently playing I counted these types: two rock, one semi-rap, four revivals, eleven original or adapted shows, and one psychological problem musical, ""Next to Normal"".In 1964 came ""Fiddler"" which stressed the characters' ""tradition"" and was a great old-style musical. Over the years Broadway learned how to deal with serious subjects and tragedy. Some people saw ""Fiddler"" as the end of a golden age.Through interviews with Hal Prince and Stephen Sondheim we see how a creative friendship was formed and how they reimagined and restructured the American musical. The new casts in musicals had to learn to do three things well rather than just one as before. They had to sing, dance, and act.In the sixties a seismic shift was going on in American society, and Broadway had to move with it. Plays like an edgy ""Cabaret"" and the first rock musical ""Hair"" shifted the ground under the feet of theatergoers. Broadway began to fall out of synch with popular culture. ""Hair"" was the real game changer. I remember welcoming the new stuff while still enjoying ""Funny Girl"", ""Hello Dolly"", and ""Mame"".In 1970 Sondheim's ""Company"" showed urban alienation, ""Chorus Line"" brought the gypsies front and center in 1975 and ran for 15 years, in `75 Kander and Ebb's ""Chicago"" drew on cynicism and black humor, and in 1979 Sondheim topped them all with his vision of the dark side in ""Sweeney Todd""In 1980 to 2004 came Weber with his spectaculars. Disney arrived with a new brand of musicals, and ""The Lion King"" is still roaring. ""Forty-second Street"" was an old-fashioned show that ran for 8 years, and, of course, ""Cats"" took its litter box into the Winter Garden for 18 years. AIDS had a devastating effect on Broadway. In 1995 came ""Rent"" which again broke the mold and ran for 3000 performance. Nine-Eleven happened, and Broadway continued with blockbusters like ""Hairspray"" and ""Wicked"".

However, was the film as good as the website said it was? Not at all.The first two hours of the show, in my opinion, were informative visually. There was interesting footage of Rodgers and Hart pretending to write ""Manhattan"", ""Showboat"" and some Ziegfeld girls. There were some nice tidbits as well.The second two hours of the piece covered the Depression and some of the Golden Age. The Depression segments had some nice footage. The ""Pal Joey"" clips were quite interesting. However, the section was very Merman and Gershwin-heavy.The Golden Age included a 15 minute segment on ""Oklahoma!"" that gave the viewer no new information at all, although there were some great film clips. ""Oklahoma!"" was probably the only musical throughly coverd in the segment. We skimmed past ""Carousel"", ""Kiss Me Kate"" and ""South Pacific"" and spent a bit of extra time on ""Guys and Dolls"", talked with Julie Andrews about ""My Fair Lady"" and then learned that Oscar Hammerstein was dead. What kind of golden age was that? Where's ""The Music Man"", ""Pajama Game"", ""The King and I"" and ""Damn Yankees?"" Not very good.The third and final two hours were about the changing of the musical from the 1960s until the present day. ""West Side Story"" was nicely coverd, but ""Gypsy"", ""Hello Dolly"", ""Camelot"", ""How to Succeed..."" and ""Mame"" were pratically ignored. Of coruse, we had to cut to a long segment on ""Fiddler on the Roof."" ""Cabaret"" was done nicely, with interesting photos of the Boris Aronson set I'd never seen before. ""Company"" was also well handled. ""Follies"" was mentioned. ""Follies"" was one of the most important shows of the 70s and deserved more air time than ""Hair."" It was given too much time. It really was just a tourist attraction. ""A Chorus Line"" was over-handled as well (of course). ""Chicago"" was not. Rare movie clips? Is that a joke because that is what the webiste promised! Chita and Gwen dancing was nice, but we got the same clip Broadway's Lost Treasures gave us. They spent no time on Verdon or Fosse, except for this and this was utter nonsense.The 80s segment, quite a commercial. Not only did it go on with the whole Porno deal on 42nd Street, but it also went on about how Disney saved New York. Michael Eisner was even interviewed! They can't interview Angela Lansbury, but they can interview Eisner? Come on!Julie Andrews was a pretty bad host. She was very annoying and acted like the viewer didn't know who she was.I think that this was an intersting look at the musical, but it could have been done better.

I'm from Massachusetts and our main paper practically hammered the last segment because the creator of the documentary, Michael Kantor, decided to cover ""commercial vehicles"" like ""The Lion King"" and ""Wicked."" The critic thought that Mr. Kantor should have covered shows like ""Ragtime"" and ""Caroline, or Change."" Personally, when I watched the documentary, I felt that Mr. Kantor knew what he was doing. He only covered shows that were historical landmarks or broke new ground. He had to conclude with Wicked because it was the most successful show of the season. It's perfectly valid as the original Bess states about George Gershwin's perception of black people in ""Porgy and Bess"". ""Caroline, or Change"" got great reviews but it was a financial flop. As for the whole thing about how you never saw a full performance, oh, well, c'est la vie. Also, I am totally o.k. with the fact that Mr. Kantor never covers ""Annie."" There were two hot shows in the late 70s. They were ""A Chorus Line"" and ""Annie"". ""A Chorus Line was more unconventional in its creation than ""Annie"" so he went with ""A Chorus Line."" I still don't know why he covered ""Sunday in the Park With George"". It's a great documentary. I am even more of a theatre geek after watching this.

846011,A1E8HGPHF98MOV,B0002V7THY,Mister Chris,"[13, 14]","...and being a self-professed ""dummy"" on the American Musical Theater I found this sort of ""Broadway History 101"" to be, at best, an entertaining starting point. I believe director Michael Kantor was handicapped from the start since the whole history of the ""Great White Way"" encompasses such a huge array of giants and geniuses (Ziegfeld, Jolson, Gershwin...) that at a mere six hours, the documentary feels like being on a bus tour speeding at 90 miles an hour. That odd feeling is magnified with Episode Four: ""Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'(1943-1960), the single most important gem in the chest.  As been noted elsewhere, that golden era of the fabulous ""Book Musicals"" which produced an unmatchable run of landmark classics like ""Oklahoma"" and ""My Fair Lady"" could have alone been given a six hour treatment instead of this set's rushed, caffeinated hour. Clearly, the episode in Broadway parlance ""lays an egg"" and compromises this documentary's overall quality.Still, there is fun to be had here and the filmmakers manage to skirt PBS' tendency to turn a giddy subject into a glum funeral march.  Julie Andrews is an exquisite host and I disagree with criticism about the high amount of movie clips used in episodes One through Three.  Movies of the 1930's in particular the early ""talkies"" appropriated so much of Broadway's luster and lore it seems only natural to use them. I also loved the novel use of a song's lyrics by showing the words playfully dancing in an about a sheet of music or a photograph.  And best of all, the ""talking heads"" used here all have something interesting to say with humor and clarity- a key element missing in, say, Ken Burn's ""Jazz.""",3,Broadway for Dummies.,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,1673,"['being', 'self-professed', 'dummy', 'American', 'Musical', 'Theater', 'found', 'sort', 'Broadway', 'History', '101', 'be', 'best', 'entertaining', 'starting', 'point', 'believe', 'director', 'Michael', 'Kantor', 'was', 'handicapped', 'start', 'whole', 'history', 'Great', 'White', 'Way', 'huge', 'array', 'giants', 'geniuses', 'Ziegfeld', 'Jolson', 'Gershwin', 'mere', 'six', 'hours', 'documentary', 'feels', 'being', 'bus', 'tour', 'speeding', '90', 'miles', 'hour', 'odd', 'feeling', 'magnified', 'Episode', 'Four', 'Oh', 'What', 'Beautiful', 'Mornin', '1943-1960', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'gem', 'chest', 'been', 'noted', 'elsewhere', 'golden', 'era', 'fabulous', 'Book', 'Musicals', 'produced', 'unmatchable', 'run', 'landmark', 'classics', 'Oklahoma', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'could', 'have', 'alone', 'been', 'given', 'six', 'hour', 'treatment', 'instead', 'set', 'rushed', 'caffeinated', 'hour', 'Clearly', 'episode', 'Broadway', 'parlance', 'egg', 'documentary', 'overall', 'quality.Still', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'filmmakers', 'manage', 'skirt', 'PBS', 'tendency', 'turn', 'giddy', 'subject', 'glum', 'funeral', 'march', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'exquisite', 'host', 'disagree', 'criticism', 'high', 'amount', 'movie', 'clips', 'used', 'episodes', 'One', 'Three', 'Movies', '1930', 'particular', 'early', 'talkies', 'appropriated', 'so', 'much', 'Broadway', 'luster', 'lore', 'only', 'natural', 'use', 'also', 'loved', 'novel', 'use', 'song', 'lyrics', 'showing', 'words', 'playfully', 'dancing', 'sheet', 'music', 'photograph', 'best', 'talking', 'heads', 'used', 'here', 'have', 'something', 'interesting', 'say', 'humor', 'clarity-', 'key', 'element', 'missing', 'say', 'Ken', 'Burn', 'Jazz']",Broadway: The American Musical
846012,A25AXWGBGJ5KBS,B0002V7THY,"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo""","[144, 149]","Soup to nuts, the folks over at PBS pulled it off. They've condensed the history of the American Broadway musical into six hours, and it feels about right.Yes yes yes, there will be hordes of folks who quibble that their ""all-time most important"" musical didn't make it, but that's missing the point.You will feel as if you have a serious grasp of the development of the American musical after seeing this film. Period. Mission accomplished.The first segments of the documentary, hosted by the ageless Julie Andrews, begin with Flo Ziegfeld, and the ""Follies"". One thing that hasn't been mentioned (yet) is the nice concomitant history lesson you get regarding New York, Times Square and American popular culture while absorbing this mini-series. The influence of opera (or more properly, operetta), vaudeville and minstrel shows are made abundantly clear, and are fascinating to someone like me who really had no exposure to this sort of material.As we reach mid-century, more and more of the people talked ABOUT in the film are actually alive...and the shows discussed are ridiculously familiar to even the most ""uneducated"" viewer. Song after song reveals their source...standards that originated on Broadway that have become part of our cultural language.Artistic ambition grows by leaps and bounds...from the musical ""revue"" to musical ""comedy"" to a dramatic ""book"" musical. Storytelling techniques through song and staging develop as fast as the geniuses on the stage, behind the stage and under the stage can think...Some of the creators, like Sondheim, are expert at analysis and insight. They provide some great ""talking head"" moments about musicals that aren't theirs! By and large, the critics they used for the documentary come across as enthusiastic, overwhelmingly knowledgeable, incisive, playful...I thought as a group they were terrific, without any hint of elitism, snobbery or any number of other ""stereotypes"" one may have about a ""New York Broadway critic.""My first audible gasp came at the end of episode five, when they play that ""I Love NY"" commercial from the late 70's. I remember seeing that as a kid, but the only thing that had any effect on me was the presence of Brooke Shields at the end of it.People like Mandy Patinkin, Patti Lupone, Angela Lansbury, those ""Cats"" creatures and yes, I think that's Patrick Swayze in ""Grease"" mode...what a riot!The most affecting portion, for me, is the last episode, for that encompasses most of my personal Broadway experience. I imagine that whatever era you feel the most affinity towards will have the same effect.Spending 6-10 minutes per musical or producer seems criminal, until you simply appreciate the tidbits for what they are. They're like little gems. Fragments of shows that you yearn to see ALL of......so let me editorialize for a second.All musicals should be filmed once with their original casts, if only for posterity. I own ""Sunday In The Park With George"" and ""Sweeney Todd"",  two exemplary musicals (covered here) and nice DVD's to own. What I wouldn't give for an ""Evita"" (not covered here) with Lupone and Patinkin, or the original cast of ""Rent"". There. Editorial done.Speaking of ""Rent"", the final fifteen to twenty minutes of the movie are an emotional tidal wave. Seeing Jonathan Larson's last day of work on video...watching him make his last milk shake at the Moondance Diner...and then finding out he dies right before previews, is not heartbreaking, it's heart-shattering.That segment leads into the piece on 9/11. Somber and a little creepy, as you've seen almost six hours of the busiest intersections on Earth suddenly empty, a modern ghost town.The filmmakers then pull off a terrific stunt. They show the post 9/11 commercial encouraging people to come back to NY. It echoes the one from over two decades prior, yet is defiant, proud and yes, a little inspiring.A quick cut to ""Hairspray"", specifically to the finale which may be the single most energetic song to ever grace the boards, and then summing it all up with ""Wicked"", a musical I coincidentally just saw three weeks ago (and loved), made for an amazing viewing experience and I could not recommend this any more highly.Now, for those of you who DO own this, my copy is plagued by a jittery video (with pristine audio) across all three discs. No one else has mentioned this, so perhaps my case is isolated...One last request: please watch the rehearsal ""bonus"" footage with Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, working on their song from Wicked called, ""For Good."" Watching and listening to these two outstanding singers tentatively creating these performances, intercut with footage from the final result, sent shivers up my spine.",5,A breathless
