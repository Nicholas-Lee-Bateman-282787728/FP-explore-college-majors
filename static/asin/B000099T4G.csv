Unfortunately Heather Morgan, who plays Lucy, wrote the screenplay and didn't do herself any favors.The premise of a man watching his emotionally delicate wife's mental stability disintegrate to the point of where she recedes into life as a dog holds some promise, but it isn't fully realized here.  Secondary characters, particularly Lisa Kudrow as the veterinarian seem lost at sea.There is something of the indulgent feel of an actor's improvisatory workshop at work here, a sort of ""let's assemble a group of independently odd characters and place them into a collective situation.""  With all of the characters wildly left of center there is little more than Lee Tergeson's slowly unhinging Peter to draw comparisons with normality to on the whack-o-meter.  Hank Azaria tries, but isn't given any meat to work with and his fairly large amount of screen time feels wasted.  How do you NOT use a talent like Azaria who pretty much livens up anything just by being there.  Evidently, this is how.Heather Morgan actually makes the most of the role she's given herself and she veers from wildly annoying to earning this viewer's sympathy at her handling by the psychiatric/medical professionals.Vincent D'Onofrio does manage to add another winner to his aresenal of misfits.  A brief bit with him playing Vivaldi on a harp is the highlight of the film.Everyone gives there all and you want to route for them - Tergeson most of all - but an earthbound script keeps the entire thing from ever becoming anything special.

753002,AVGX4BYF7J559,B000099T4G,"Jer ""kingjer151""","[0, 0]","SynopsisBark was directed by Kasia Adamik and was her first movie that she directed. A man tries to hide the fact that his wife now thinks she is a dog. He goes through turmoil trying to hide it from neighbors, family, friends and her work. Will he stay with the one he loves or give up? Will she remain a dog or be able to cope with the everyday stress of life?Plot ratingThe movie has themes of infidelity, commitment, and psychological trauma. We don't see a plot like this very often and I found it compelling. The husband truly does everything he can to bring his wife back. They did a good job at incorporating how she became a dog and mixes it with stressful life situations, such as, her family, people she deals with everyday,  and her marriage. It would be nice to be able to has a nervous breakdown and just be able to turn into a dog who has not a care in the world and can lay around all day but I'm not that lucky, plus, I can't reach that far to my balls. I give the plot an 8/10.Actor/ActressesLee Tegesen does a great performance playing the torn husband who tries everything to get his wife back, and hiding her breakdown from friends,family, and her job. I haven't seen him in a lot of things but he always makes his roles feel real when he does something. Heather Morgan plays a dog for most of the movie with flashbacks explaining how she became a dog. She does a great job at playing a dog and also with being a neurotic woman. Hank Azaria tries to play the funny committed best-friend who cracks some jokes and tries to find the lighter side of things in this serious situation. Lisa Kudrow plays the nice vet who tries to help Lees character and also plays a love interest. She seems to play the same character in all the things she does which is a little disappointing. I give the plot an 8/10.DVD ExtrasThis movie comes from First Look Pictures. The extras are terrible. Only a few trailers for other movies. (Man, I really should start picking DVD's with better extras). It gets a big old 0/10.Personal ThoughtsThis movie does a great job at incorporating family problems, emotional distress, and marriage commitment into the movie. All the actors are very entertaining and bring their own thing into the movie. Although this movie isn't very well known and got a bad rating I would suggest it to people who are fans of psychology or interested in the plot.All in all this movie is good and gets at 16/30.

Lee Tergesen, Hank Azaria, Lisa Kudrow and Vincent D'Onofrio are all extremely talented actors that do wonderfully with the material they're given.  Some scenes are laugh-out-loud funny.  The premise, a woman beginning to think she's a dog, is original and full of potential to be either humorous or dramatic.So what went wrong?  Not only was most of the movie not funny or moving, it was banal and pointless.  The over-the-top characters (Lisa Kudrow is a ditzy vet; Vincent D'Onofrio is a psychologist who wishes he could play the harp for a living; Hank Azaria is a rebel who can't keep a job for more than a week; Lee Tergesen is the normal guy who watches the insanity around him with amazement), instead of being interesting, mostly came across as silly and badly thought out.  Scenes meant to show us how crazy life was made little sense and were badly scripted.  The final scenes, obviously meant to be heartwarming, were soppy and rather abrupt.  Plot lines started and then went nowhere, leaving me wondering what happened.This movie is worth a look if you're a fan of any of the actors.  They all make the most of what they've been given, and each has a scene or two where they rise above the mediocre material.
