He's a great actor, but really could have done better; it's a shame he had to accept this role in LAST RITES. In this movie, he plays a priest who is actually the son of a Mafia don, but moved away from that lifestyle. He gets drawn back into it by meeting with the mistress of his old friend, who was gunned down in cold blood. The mistress, played by Daphne Zuniga, slips in and out of a so-called Mexican accent in this movie, and is not that credible in this role anyway.  Predictably, he gives her shelter in his room at the monastery (again, unbelievable) and falls in love with her while trying to protect her.  I had to watch this twice because the plot was so ridiculous that I thought I missed something; it's a very convoluted and unbelievable plot and I can see why Roger Ebert rated this film so poorly. I also did not like the way the movie producers seem to glorify the Mafia; they almost seem to have a morbid fascination with that lifestyle.A better way to spend your money and see Tom Berenger in a much more credible role would be to buy SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME, TRUE BLUE, or AN OCCASIONAL HELL.  I am sorry he had to waste his acting talents on such a poor role.",3,MOVIE TITLE APPROPRIATE--should have last rites,1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,1279,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'having', 'first', 'seen', 'performance', 'SOMEONE', 'TO', 'WATCH', 'ME', 'great', 'actor', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'shame', 'had', 'accept', 'role', 'LAST', 'RITES', 'movie', 'priest', 'who', 'actually', 'son', 'Mafia', 'don', 'moved', 'away', 'lifestyle', 'drawn', 'back', 'meeting', 'mistress', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'cold', 'blood', 'mistress', 'played', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'so-called', 'Mexican', 'accent', 'movie', 'not', 'credible', 'role', 'anyway', 'Predictably', 'shelter', 'room', 'monastery', 'again', 'unbelievable', 'love', 'trying', 'protect', 'had', 'watch', 'twice', 'plot', 'was', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'thought', 'missed', 'something', 'very', 'convoluted', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'rated', 'film', 'so', 'poorly', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'way', 'movie', 'producers', 'seem', 'glorify', 'Mafia', 'almost', 'seem', 'have', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'lifestyle.A', 'better', 'way', 'spend', 'money', 'see', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'much', 'more', 'credible', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'buy', 'SOMEONE', 'TO', 'WATCH', 'OVER', 'ME', 'TRUE', 'BLUE', 'AN', 'OCCASIONAL', 'HELL', 'am', 'sorry', 'had', 'waste', 'acting', 'talents', 'poor', 'role']",N/A

Just don't expect to feel too edified at the end of the movie! It's over-melodramatic typical B-movie fare. Also, some people might be upset by the filmmakers' obvious agenda to get a priest involved in a love affair. And let's face it, we all can tell that this is where the film is headed from the beginning.The main stars, Tom Berenger and Daphne Zuniga are fine. Tom Berenger always does well as the handsome, tormented and conflicted hero; Daphne Zuniga was very pretty, but I was little confused about her role. There were elements of sleaze to her part (the first scene she's in certainly qualifies) and maybe she's not the best actress for sleaze. I haven't quite made up my mind about that. But still, she was capable enough.If you are a fan of either Berenger or Zuniga, and don't mind a somewhat tacky, implausable B-movie, you'll get a kick out of this film.",3,Fun Potboiler B-movie,1039910400,"12 15, 2002",2002,1002,"['vote', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'was', 'implausable', 'bit', 'tacky', 'tawdry', 'enjoyed', 'anyway', 'entertaining', 'yarn', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'feel', 'too', 'edified', 'end', 'movie', 'over-melodramatic', 'typical', 'B-movie', 'fare', 'Also', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'upset', 'filmmakers', 'obvious', 'agenda', 'get', 'priest', 'involved', 'love', 'affair', 'let', 'face', 'can', 'tell', 'where', 'film', 'headed', 'beginning.The', 'main', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'are', 'fine', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'always', 'well', 'handsome', 'tormented', 'conflicted', 'hero', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'was', 'very', 'pretty', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'role', 'were', 'elements', 'sleaze', 'part', 'first', 'scene', 'certainly', 'qualifies', 'maybe', 'not', 'best', 'actress', 'sleaze', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'still', 'was', 'capable', 'enough.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Berenger', 'Zuniga', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'somewhat', 'tacky', 'implausable', 'B-movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', 'film']",N/A

You can't take it seriously, it's just like most *rebel* or *mafia* movies, it's a lot of fun.  In this instance, having the only son of a mafia don (termed &quot;godfather&quot; in the movie, which was going way too far) becoming a priest, and with a strong hint of the sensational reason behind that motivation, it becomes even more interesting as his former brother-in-law's girlfriend comes under his protection and his vow of celebacy is seriously shaken.  Actually Freud would have had a field day with this movie.  The problem with it, actually, is not enough of the characters - particularly the family itself - is seen interracting with each other so we have a fuller history of the family's relationships and the internal workings of the organization.  A rather satisfactory finish, but one could have wished for a sequel or more drawn-out ending.  Another problem is star Berenger looks considerably older (and somewhat out-of-shape) than his 33-year-old character should be.",4,Guilty Pleasure,992390400,"06 13, 2001",2001,1206,"['had', 'read', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'was', 'dumped', 'straight', 'video', 'theatrical', 'release', 'strange', 'how', 'many', 'really', 'bad', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'get', 'released', 'one', 'decidedly', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'just', 'most', '*rebel*', '*mafia*', 'movies', 'lot', 'fun', 'instance', 'having', 'only', 'son', 'mafia', 'don', 'termed', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'becoming', 'priest', 'strong', 'hint', 'sensational', 'reason', 'motivation', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'former', 'brother-in-law', 'girlfriend', 'protection', 'vow', 'celebacy', 'seriously', 'shaken', 'Actually', 'Freud', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'movie', 'problem', 'actually', 'not', 'enough', 'characters', 'particularly', 'family', 'seen', 'interracting', 'other', 'have', 'fuller', 'history', 'family', 'relationships', 'internal', 'workings', 'organization', 'rather', 'satisfactory', 'finish', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'wished', 'sequel', 'more', 'drawn-out', 'ending', 'problem', 'star', 'Berenger', 'considerably', 'older', 'somewhat', 'out-of-shape', '33-year-old', 'character', 'should', 'be']",N/A
