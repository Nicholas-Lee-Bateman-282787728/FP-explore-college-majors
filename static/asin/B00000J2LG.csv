The DVD starts with a &quot;thank you for watching our film&quot; - a sort of &quot;we hope you don't think it's too bad, we know there are problems&quot; sort of thing - from the producers.

505741,A2BRVLLGGLX08G,B00000J2LG,Cookie Crook,"[2, 3]","Green Plaid Shirt is a movie about two men Phillip (Gregory Phelan) and Guy (Kevin Spirtas) who meet briefly at a yard sale and both want to purchase a plaid green shirt. The two meet up later at an outdoor bar and thus blossoms this romance were they fall in love, have sex and move in together. As the movie jumps forward and back  and forward again, Guy has left Phillip for another man and contracts HIV and then moves back in with Phillip. In addition, several of Phillip's closest friends also have contracted HIV and begin entering full-blown AIDS and die.I know this movie was made on a budget, but the film quality was so poor I had to try and read the actors lips to actually tell what they were saying and that was with the volume at max. The script is scant, a fast paced romance that is editted so badly you lose the power and effect of the couple's struggles in the film. The writing and acting comes across as forced and wooden, which is  more a fault of the writer and director then of the actors. This movie deals with a sensitive and serious topic AIDS, however to much emphasis is placed on the physical side of sex and random nonsense commentary, rather than on the complex and constantly changing face of love and comparsion. Lastly, the green plaid shirt just became annoying after the tenth time seeing it, not mention it is one of the ugliest shirts I have seen.

I noticed that the director, to ensure the pristine look of the film, had the VHS version letter-boxed so that we may enjoy the entire screen as seen  by the theatre audience. I wish he'd taken the same care with the audio  quality of the video (and maybe of the film, too). It's garbled and  murmured and one can only catch about every third line of dialogue - if  that. Even the rewinding and replay didn't help (thinking maybe I could've  understood it on second play). So, I guess the third of the movie I could  hear was credible and worth the effort.Secondly, I get really fed up  with the premise that really hip gay men are completely or mostly gorgeous.  They may be poor, but they have bodies to die for, and big, exciting,  fabulous lives. Even when down, they're a laugh a minute! This is probably  what most gay men would want everyone to believe, but it just isn't  reality. I'm looking forward to the film that can deal with that - that can  show ordinary lives in extraordinary ways.

There are substantial passages that are impossible to hear.  A less critical but annoying issue is the film editing.  For some reason, the director apparently felt a need to tell the story with flashbacks and flashforwards.  The effect here is not good cinema or storytelling.  It merely seems trendy.  The story of the lover who dies from AIDS would actually seem more tender, loving and meaningful if it had simply been told in a straight-forward manner.  Indeed, the jumping about seems to diminish the tragedy of his death.  The acting is very good and the premise of building a story around a plaid shirt is both effective and appealing.  The romance of the two lead characters is tender and caring and is definitely worth experiencing by watching this slightly flawed  gem of a movie.

It takes a lot of attention, audio adjustments, and frequent rewinds to understand everything that's said, but it is WELL worth the trouble. People who aren't willing to invest such time and energy will understandably hate this movie, but those who are willing to will be greatly rewarded.It's probably the most beautifully moving and believable love story I have ever seen anywhere. Besides the sound, everything about this movie--writing, direction, acting, editing, photography--is absolutely perfect and astonishing. The story line is not chronologically linear, but it's perfectly fitted to the development of this particular story and makes it easier to follow than if it WERE chronological.This is no fairy tale romance. There are failures, betrayals, stupidity, selfishness and much sadness along the way, but that's how life is. Learning to love another person THROUGH troubles like that is the greatest good available to us as human beings, and that is exactly what this movie is about.Two of the supporting characters (Jerry and Devon) are so self-centered and obnoxious I was relieved any time they were out of the story, but even they are entirely realistic, believable and very well-acted. Everybody else--including Phil's mother, who's on for only a couple of minutes--is simply perfect. Others have rightly commended Gregory Phelan and Kevin Spirtas in the leads; I'll add Jonathan Klein as Todd, one of the most original, appealing, and fascinating characters who ever appeared in any movie.I have never recommended a movie as highly as I recommend Green Plaid Shirt, to anybody who is willing to invest some of him(or her)self in watching it.",5,Flawless love story made challenging by poor sound,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,1772,"['Green', 'Plaid', 'Shirt', 'flawlessly', 'conceived', 'executed', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'made', 'challenging', 'poor', 'sound', 'quality', 'lot', 'attention', 'audio', 'adjustments', 'frequent', 'rewinds', 'understand', 'everything', 'said', 'WELL', 'trouble', 'People', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'willing', 'invest', 'such', 'time', 'energy', 'will', 'understandably', 'hate', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'will', 'be', 'greatly', 'rewarded.It', 'probably', 'most', 'beautifully', 'moving', 'believable', 'love', 'story', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'sound', 'everything', 'movie', 'writing', 'direction', 'acting', 'editing', 'photography', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'astonishing', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'chronologically', 'linear', 'perfectly', 'fitted', 'development', 'particular', 'story', 'easier', 'follow', 'WERE', 'chronological.This', 'fairy', 'tale', 'romance', 'are', 'failures', 'betrayals', 'stupidity', 'selfishness', 'much', 'sadness', 'way', 'how', 'life', 'Learning', 'love', 'person', 'troubles', 'greatest', 'good', 'available', 'human', 'beings', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'about.Two', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Jerry', 'Devon', 'are', 'so', 'self-centered', 'obnoxious', 'was', 'relieved', 'time', 'were', 'story', 'even', 'are', 'entirely', 'realistic', 'believable', 'very', 'well-acted', 'Everybody', 'else', 'including', 'Phil', 'mother', 'who', 'only', 'couple', 'minutes', 'simply', 'perfect', 'Others', 'have', 'rightly', 'commended', 'Gregory', 'Phelan', 'Kevin', 'Spirtas', 'leads', ""'ll"", 'add', 'Jonathan', 'Klein', 'Todd', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'appealing', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'who', 'ever', 'appeared', 'movie.I', 'have', 'never', 'recommended', 'movie', 'as', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Green', 'Plaid', 'Shirt', 'anybody', 'who', 'willing', 'invest', 'self', 'watching']",Green Plaid Shirt VHS

So, that told me that the other reviewers here were expecting a high budget film which it isn't. I thought the film was very put together and made alot of sense. It was a story of the main actor's love, lose and letting go do to AIDS. I usually avoid these type of films (AIDS related) because I myself have seen too many people dying of AIDS. I do recommend this film to anyone that would like to see the ""historical"" side of HIV and AIDS as it related to the gay community.",5,This movie isn't as bad as everyone here is saying it is.,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,762,"['started', 'watching', 'film', 'intent', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'like', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'as', 'soon', 'started', 'disclaimer', 'producer', 'came', 'up', 'said', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'problems', 'are', 'problems', 'first', 'films', 'So', 'told', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'were', 'expecting', 'high', 'budget', 'film', ""n't"", 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'put', 'together', 'made', 'alot', 'sense', 'was', 'story', 'main', 'actor', 'love', 'lose', 'letting', 'go', 'do', 'AIDS', 'usually', 'avoid', 'type', 'films', 'AIDS', 'related', 'have', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'historical', 'side', 'HIV', 'AIDS', 'related', 'gay', 'community']",Green Plaid Shirt VHS

The sound is so poor that a decent home movie would easily outclass the sound here.  I am not sure how a producer or distributor would think it was okay to release a movie where the sound was this poor.However, just like a foreign film, you can usually get the jist of what is happening even if you can't understand the words.  If only there was something going on in this film.  There isn't, and to cover up for the lack of plot or storyline, the director or editor chops up the pieces and plays them out of sequence to, apparently, create the illusion of story.Really, this film is a disaster, even when graded on a curve for gay films.  Apart from the decent leads, which do a fair job of carrying this film for awhile, there's really nothing here to see.

First of all, the characters, except for the lead, are basically all unlikable and uninteresting. And I'm sure to the chagrin of many gay viewers, they all end up having sex with each other (no wonder we are talked about - not all gay people and gay relationships are this way!) The major problem that I had with this film was the confusing time line and flashbacks. In many instances, it is hard to tell at what point something is happening and you are wondering if it is after or before the previous scene. Another problem is extremely poor audio (even on dvd). Pluses are good acting and imaginative cinematography but these points alone fail to make this film recommendable.",2,Tedious and disjointed,975283200,"11 27, 2000",2000,780,"['film', 'good', 'intentions', 'off', 'interesting', 'start', 'quickly', 'collapes', 'First', 'all', 'characters', 'lead', 'are', 'basically', 'unlikable', 'uninteresting', ""'m"", 'sure', 'chagrin', 'many', 'gay', 'viewers', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'sex', 'other', 'wonder', 'are', 'talked', 'not', 'gay', 'people', 'gay', 'relationships', 'are', 'way', 'major', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'confusing', 'time', 'line', 'flashbacks', 'many', 'instances', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'point', 'something', 'happening', 'are', 'wondering', 'previous', 'scene', 'problem', 'extremely', 'poor', 'audio', 'even', 'dvd', 'Pluses', 'are', 'good', 'acting', 'imaginative', 'cinematography', 'points', 'alone', 'fail', 'make', 'film', 'recommendable']",Green Plaid Shirt VHS

At first I thought it was the copy I had. But after I had read other reviews I realized it's the film itself. THere were moments I could hardly understand the dialogues! Well, it didn't help to watch it at all.The story. Not bad, but the action suddenly slows down and there is too much talking. The sub-plots don't bring anything to the film, don't enhance it. Moreover, the border between past and present events is sometimes so vague, that it's really hard to make a head or tail of the plot.To sum up: it's not an optimistic film, but acting is fair good.

505755,A2Q5L7BTBEZN6L,B00000J2LG,queer movie lover,"[3, 3]","""Green Plaid Shirt"" is a fabulously touching (and heart-wrenching) lovestory that brilliantly covers so many bases. Set in the late-80s tomid-90s, a group of gay men is struggling to find the balance betweensimply being in love and the ever-evolving world of queer politics andrealities--from polyamory to finding community to dealing with AIDS.The opening scene sets the mood for a story of true love, and the painsand joys that go with it. Philip is searching for meaning in the love thathe has felt for so long, and takes us on a journey through his memories ofthe past ten years of commitment. What he reveals is a beautiful story oftwo men falling in love, and then forcing themselves to change their ways,to open their relationship, and to detach themselves from feelings ofdependence and of jealousy. Through the years, other partners come and go,they deal with friends dying of AIDS, they go through good times and badtimes, both together and apart. And ultimately, they discover what it isthey both need.""Green Plaid Shirt"" tackles a lot. It's a very astute story aboutinsecurities, love, the ebs and flows of monogamy in queer culture, andthe harsh realities of AIDS and other illnesses. It's a remarkable lovestory that could happen in any decade, but is a poignant story about gaylove in the 80s and 90s. It's a phenomenal tale with humor, heart-warmingpassion, and a powerful message.
