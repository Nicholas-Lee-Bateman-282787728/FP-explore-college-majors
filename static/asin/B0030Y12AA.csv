Some episodes may be cut a little but I don't seem to notice. I am glad to have this and all 5 other seasons. I wonder if season 7 will ever come because it was not the best.,5,The last good season,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,310,"['really', 'last', 'season', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Season', '7', 'was', 'bad', 'Hilda', 'Zelda', 'were', 'not', 'season', 'great', 'funny', 'episodes', 'may', 'be', 'cut', 'little', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'notice', 'am', 'glad', 'have', '5', 'other', 'seasons', 'wonder', 'season', '7', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'was', 'not', 'best']",N/A

Even in its sixth season there are still plenty of laughs trying to keep Sabrina interesting.

I think if it wasn't for my attraction to the two aunts and the cat, I may not have been a fan of the show.  The 7th and last season is a real downer with the aunts only appearing once or twice in the whole season.  Another drawback to Sabrina is the laugh track, laughing at stuff that just is not funny.
