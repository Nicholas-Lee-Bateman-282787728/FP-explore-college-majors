He was a very talented actor who had the knack for naturalism and dead-pan humor. The kids are okay and mostly tolerable. Of them all, Tatum O'Neal, the Oscar winner (on first try) daughter of Ryan O'Neal from Barry Lyndon, gives the best performance and is able to match Walter line for line throughout The Bad News Bears. The championship game is the tipping point, causing the movie to shoot itself in the foot and unravel thereafter. That's why people today hate baseball and want have nothing to do with it.

223198,A20IIR0422G3A5,6300216810,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 5]","`The Bad News Bears' was a very popular movie starring the inimitable Walter Matthau. So, why in the world did anyone think it could be improved on putting Billy Bob Thornton in Matthau's role as the washed up alcoholic former ball player Buttermaker in the position of coaching a little league team of baseball misfits.The puzzle is deepened in that the new version follows the old almost exactly, scene for scene and line for line. And, everything that was changed in the new version made the movie weaker. The four most obvious changes are replacing the city councilman who hires Buttermaker with a female trial lawyer; replacing the opposing team's (the Yankees) manager, originally played very straight by Vic Morrow, with a characture of a straight arrow win at all costs manager / dad; replacing the asthmatic statistics fanatic, Ogilvy with a kid in a wheelchair; and changing Buttermaker's `day job' from pool cleaner to exterminator.While the influence of some of these changes may be subtle, the change from asthmatic to paraplegic is perfectly symbolic of what is wrong with the remake. It is reasonable to believe that an asthmatic could make some attempt at playing baseball. Putting a wheelchair bound boy on a baseball team is simply absurd. While the original got lots of laughs by being totally plausible, the remake looses it by relying on patently implausible or at least not very believable situations. The biggest implausibility is Thornton's interpretation of Matthau's role. Thornton is a very talented actor and his fouler mouth brings just a bit more bite to the role, but he simply can't hold a candle to Matthau's original take on the character.The original is still a classic.

223206,A1SD82ZAT3INZ2,6300216810,Daniel Hayes,"[0, 0]","This is a good movie. It also is the first PG film I remember watching, and let me tell you my virgin ears of 8 years old were shocked. This movie reminds me of why I don't have the heart to put my son in neighborhood sports. The competitiveness, the vanity, the pressure it's all too much. I remember about 6 years ago hearing about a riot that broke out at a school sports game, and a poor 17 year old girl paid the price for the wrath of the spectating parents. It broke my heart what happened to her, and I guess my heart breaks for the kids in this movie. It's a good underdog movie about a has-been drunken third rate ball player who coaches a team of throwaway kids. There's a racist shortstop, an obese catcher, and a whole bunch of kids that just wouldn't fit in the ""Perfect"" team. It was done well in the sense that it showed the team being built from the ground up, and the addition of 2 good players to shoulder the weight, and only to increase the diversity of this team as now we add a girl, and a juvenile deliquent. Alot of good performances went into this movie Walter Matthau as the coach, Vic Morrow as the opposing coach a Type A(as in anal) person, and Joyce Van Patten as his assistant, and Tatum O' Neal as the girl pitcher Amanda. These aren't Oscar-Winning performances, but they carry their weight for this movie. The film is a dark comedy, and that's putting it mildly as we see how human nature just takes over when a person tries to make a kid into a better person...a promising adult. This film also made me have some prejudices against parents as I feel that parents are so much wanting to be cocksure about their kids being good athletes that they bet their whole paycheck for their kids team to win. Let's face it parents we have to let our kids just have fun, and learn on their own about fair-play, and good sportsmanship. If we do what one parent says in this movie: ""You're supposed to tag him you dummy"" we've shown our kids where our heart is it's not about our kids either.....it's about us living through our kids, and that's not a good way to be. I don't know if they do this where they have a class at the beginning of the sports season where the adults learn about good sportsmanship, and just chilling out at the game....if not they should. I still remember the 17 year old girl, and if I was at that game I would've comforted her like she was my own daughter, and nurse her wounds. We send a mixed message to our kids when we act like this, and that's: ""It's only fun when you win"" instead of ""It's not if you win or lose, but how you play the game."" As I said I cannot lie this movie is good, and it's all too real about what happens in organized neighborhood sports. Parents it's time to wake up, and smell the coffee; Are we exposing our kids to this because we like the sport, and hopefully they'll like it, or is this one of the ways we try to get to heaven thinking God will let me in if I show how dedicated I am to making my child into a winner.

223209,A11PTCZ2FM2547,6300216810,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[3, 4]","Talk about waxing nostalgia.  I hadn't seen THE BAD NEWS BEARS since it made its successful run in theaters way back in the mid-70s; then I recently came across this film on TCM (thank goodness for Turner) and all of the memories and charm of the Bears came rushing back into my noggin.  Before long I was chuckling and giggling while watching the ambivalent antics of ex-minor leaguer Morris Buttermaker (one of Walter Matthau's best roles, in my humble opine) as he sits in the dugout with his ice chest full of suds and watches his Little League team of misfits completely warp America's favorite past-time.  Matthau's Buttermaker couldn't care less his Bears are stinking up the diamond (they get run-ruled in the 1st inning of their first game); all he wants is his paycheck for coaching the team so he can drink away his meaningless life.  But Buttermaker does possess one redeeming quality--a conscience--and when it finally dawns on him that his players are being endlessly humiliated he decides to give them a competitive chance by recruiting Amanda (Tatum O'Neal), the 12-year-old daughter of his ex-girlfriend.  Amanda's got a sensational fastball and an eye-popping 12-6 curveball, and with the addition of Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley)--the area's chain-smoking, Harley-riding, juvenile delinquent--the Bad News Bears indeed become. . .the Bad News Bears.Did I mention this film is charming?  The mayhem of the Bears in a game, Buttermaker's drunken indifference, sets the comical stage for the story to develop; once the Bears start moving up in the standings there's a transformation.  Suddenly Buttermaker becomes what so many overbearing Little League adults become when their teams are winning--he becomes a jerk.  Coach Turner (Vic Morrow), his antagonist leading the hated Yankees, is the epitome of the win-at-all-costs coach, and Buttermaker is swiftly heading in that direction.  The championship game becomes the culmination of these two men's competitive egos. . .until Coach Turner gets a resounding comeuppance from his own son, and Buttermaker realizes that baseball, in the grand scheme of all things, is only a game.  Accordingly the charm of THE BAD NEWS BEARS manifests itself with crystal clarity.For those who have not seen this original be forewarned:  it's definitely jarring.  My, how times have changed in well over thirty years!  Many of the children swear like sailors, Haley's character smokes like a chimney, and after the final game Buttermaker gives all his charges a cold one, which they begin downing.

223210,A1LACH6MLQWZ,6300216810,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","For whatever reason I never got around to watching &#34;The Bad News Bears&#34; for 37 years after its release in 1976. Perhaps that was because I figured it was just another kiddie flick about baseball. Last night my wife and I watched it for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised.Although it features kids (lots of them), including a stellar role by Tatum O'Neal, it is not a kiddie flick. Kiddie flicks usually don't feature kids realistically. This one does, all the way down to their prejudices, their grossness (yes, they use &#34;bad&#34; language and pick their noses in public), their taunting, even their (fairly mild) bullying. It also presents us with a realistic (though by no means preachy) portrayal of overbearing parents and coaches who take the games more seriously than do their children.But the real stars of the show are Walter Matthau in his role as Coach Buttermaker, an ex-minor league ballplayer who cleans pools for a living and drinks beer laced with cheap whiskey, and who is coaxed into coaching a team of rejects in exchange for money, and the daughter of his ex-girlfriend, a precocious 12-year-old girl (played by Tatum O'Neal) with a great fastball.The storyline itself is straightforward. Buttermaker, despite his cranky disposition and sometimes tipsy (to downright drunken) condition, molds a team of misfits who have been cut by the other youth baseball teams into a genuinely competitive outfit that winds up playing in the championship game. While the story of the sports underdog rising to the top has been tried over and over again, rarely has it succeeded in such a wonderful way as it has in &#34;Bad News Bears.&#34;There are a few places where one has to suspend one's disbelief. Buttermaker would never get away in real life with bringing his cooler of beer into the dugout and drinking its contents during the game. And the transformation of utterly clueless and incompetent players into a genuinely competitive team in such a short time is hardly realistic. But if one can get past these incongruities, this is certainly a film worth watching.",5,Charming and (for the most part) realistic,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,2096,"['reason', 'never', 'got', 'watching', '34', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', '34', '37', 'years', 'release', '1976', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'figured', 'was', 'just', 'kiddie', 'flick', 'baseball', 'Last', 'night', 'wife', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'kids', 'lots', 'including', 'stellar', 'role', 'Tatum', ""O'Neal"", 'not', 'kiddie', 'flick', 'Kiddie', 'flicks', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'feature', 'kids', 'realistically', 'one', 'way', 'prejudices', 'grossness', 'yes', 'use', '34', 'bad', '34', 'language', 'pick', 'noses', 'public', 'taunting', 'even', 'fairly', 'mild', 'bullying', 'also', 'realistic', 'means', 'preachy', 'portrayal', 'overbearing', 'parents', 'coaches', 'who', 'take', 'games', 'more', 'seriously', 'do', 'children.But', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'role', 'Coach', 'Buttermaker', 'ex-minor', 'league', 'ballplayer', 'who', 'pools', 'living', 'drinks', 'beer', 'laced', 'cheap', 'whiskey', 'who', 'coaxed', 'coaching', 'team', 'rejects', 'exchange', 'money', 'daughter', 'ex-girlfriend', 'precocious', '12-year-old', 'girl', 'played', 'Tatum', ""O'Neal"", 'great', 'fastball.The', 'storyline', 'straightforward', 'Buttermaker', 'cranky', 'disposition', 'sometimes', 'tipsy', 'downright', 'drunken', 'condition', 'team', 'misfits', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'other', 'youth', 'baseball', 'teams', 'genuinely', 'competitive', 'outfit', 'up', 'playing', 'championship', 'game', 'story', 'sports', 'underdog', 'rising', 'top', 'been', 'tried', 'over', 'again', 'rarely', 'succeeded', 'such', 'wonderful', 'way', '34', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears.', '34', 'are', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'one', 'suspend', 'one', 'disbelief', 'Buttermaker', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'away', 'real', 'life', 'bringing', 'cooler', 'beer', 'dugout', 'drinking', 'contents', 'game', 'transformation', 'utterly', 'clueless', 'incompetent', 'players', 'genuinely', 'competitive', 'team', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'hardly', 'realistic', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'incongruities', 'certainly', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

This is possibly one of the best ""kids movies"" of all time ... if you like an unsentimental, raw look at how kids really are.  No glossy cinematography here, the Bears stands as a testament to the truth of kids lives. Not all perfect angels or demons, kids are more complex than we give them credit.  Sadly, this truth seems to stop with this film; ""The Bad News Bears"" is an anomaly rather than a groundbreaker.We never see the kids at home, or with their families except for some brief snippets at the very end; the film exists only on the playing field and the dugouts. Matthau is simply wonderful as a gruff drunk who doesn't suddenly become loveable in a bland burst of generic orchestral mediocrity -- kudos to the filmmakers for incorporating the score to Carmen throughout the entire film.Vic Morrow shines in a supporting role that embodies the cutthroat world of American Little League (and sadly the movie made me ask, does everything about America have to be so cutthroat?) and Morrow's performance is eerily true-to-life of all the sports parents and coaches out there who are more into the game than the kids.

Foul mouth kids? Horrors! A drunk coach passing out on the mound? Bring forth the Inquisition! A kid smoking a cigarette? Heresy! A coach passing out beers to underage kids? CRUCIFY HIM!Walter Matthau is great as the loser pool cleaner ex-minor-league pitcher who doesn't believe in himself, much less in the team he's been paid to coach. Tatum O'Neal mostly reprises her role from ""Paper Moon"" as the con artist kid with the sassy banter who ends up falling for a loser father figure, adding a killer curve ball to her repertoire but not getting enough banter time with Matthau to really dominate the movie like she did with ""Paper Moon"" (but the few scenes she does get are good ones). The true stars are the kids, a bunch of unknowns whose banter makes the movie in a way that all of Matthau's grumpy old man antics and Tatum O'Neal's sassy presence don't.This is not a perfect movie by any means. Because the ensemble cast is so large, many of the characters (especially the unsympathetic ones) are painted with a broad brush to the point that they are caricatures, and the progression of the Bears from total losers to winners, and the progression of Coach Buttermaker from going through the motions to genuinely caring about the kids, is unevenly portrayed. But even today, its combination of honesty and talented acting makes it arms and shoulders above the dishonest treacley-sweet dreck that passes for ""family entertainment"" today. And as someone else has already pointed out, it is a perfect myth-puncturing critique of what Little League has become and still is for the most part (a bunch of self-involved and often-abusive parents who miss the point of it all), while still being entertaining and yes, funny, in a way that all the sanctimonious wanna-be's inspired by this film never manage.",4,Perfect proof that the best is behind us,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,1942,"['movie', 'perfect', 'proof', '1970', 'were', 'last', 'era', 'great', 'American', 'film', 'making', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'today', 'Foul', 'mouth', 'kids', 'Horrors', 'drunk', 'coach', 'passing', 'out', 'mound', 'Bring', 'forth', 'Inquisition', 'kid', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'Heresy', 'A', 'coach', 'passing', 'out', 'beers', 'underage', 'kids', 'CRUCIFY', 'HIM', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'great', 'loser', 'pool', 'cleaner', 'ex-minor-league', 'pitcher', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'much', 'less', 'team', 'been', 'paid', 'coach', 'Tatum', ""O'Neal"", 'mostly', 'role', 'Paper', 'Moon', 'con', 'artist', 'kid', 'sassy', 'banter', 'who', 'up', 'falling', 'loser', 'father', 'figure', 'adding', 'killer', 'curve', 'ball', 'repertoire', 'not', 'getting', 'enough', 'banter', 'time', 'Matthau', 'really', 'dominate', 'movie', 'did', 'Paper', 'Moon', 'few', 'scenes', 'get', 'are', 'good', 'ones', 'true', 'stars', 'are', 'kids', 'bunch', 'unknowns', 'banter', 'movie', 'way', 'Matthau', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'antics', 'Tatum', ""O'Neal"", 'sassy', 'presence', ""don't.This"", 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'means', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'so', 'large', 'many', 'characters', 'especially', 'unsympathetic', 'ones', 'are', 'painted', 'broad', 'brush', 'point', 'are', 'caricatures', 'progression', 'Bears', 'total', 'losers', 'winners', 'progression', 'Coach', 'Buttermaker', 'going', 'motions', 'genuinely', 'caring', 'kids', 'unevenly', 'portrayed', 'even', 'today', 'combination', 'honesty', 'talented', 'acting', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'dishonest', 'treacley-sweet', 'dreck', 'family', 'entertainment', 'today', 'someone', 'else', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'perfect', 'myth-puncturing', 'critique', 'what', 'Little', 'League', 'become', 'still', 'most', 'part', 'bunch', 'self-involved', 'often-abusive', 'parents', 'who', 'miss', 'point', 'still', 'being', 'entertaining', 'yes', 'funny', 'way', 'sanctimonious', 'wanna-be', 'inspired', 'film', 'never', 'manage']",N/A

(Parents can learn lessons from this flick as well).So, if you have not seen this since you were a kid, check it out, there was a lot more going on than you remember, and if you are an adult wondering if you should let your eight year old see it, go for it.

223224,A3GMHY67T5RN3M,6300216810,Jeff Kelleher,"[1, 1]","I have read some of the negative--even scathing--reviews, and all I can say is that if you do not feel uplift in this tale of flawed people finding nobility and redemption, well, then you are an ignorant and narrow little prig.Under-appreciated when released, this 1976 tale of a hapless Little League team that scraps and scrapes its way to contendership is a nearly-perfect movie. It is the ""Casablanca"" of kid sports movies: it seems cliched only because it invented the cliches.Thanks to a crisp screenplay and taut editing, never in 102 minutes are you lost, confused, or bored. The direction, acting, and score coalesce around the fine screenplay to turn the picture into a gem.Walter Matthau is incomparable as Morris Buttermaker, a beer-and-whiskey-soaked ex-minor-leaguer who now cleans pools for his living and is persuaded to coach the team (""the Dads are too busy"") by an offer of money.  Tatum O'Neal is at her most winning as Amanda Whurlitzer, Buttermaker's 11-year-old sort-of stepdaughter who happens to be a ringer of a pitcher.  Vic Morrow is spot-on as the overbearing, win-at-all-costs coach/father. Jackie Earle Haley as Kelly Leak defines for all time the bad-boy adolescent. The ensemble of unknown kids who make up the rest of the team are astonishingly good.In a brilliant stroke, Jerry Fielding adapted the flavorful score from ""Carmen"", much enhancing the picture.There are so many affecting vignettes that I can only cover a few without giving away too much.In one of the opening scenes, Buttermaker is being schmoozed by the upstanding father who hired him--glory of the game, great thing you are doing, blah, blah.  Buttermaker talks over him.  ""Have you got the check?....The check isn't signed....You forgot to sign the check.""  We know immediately that he cares for nothing at the outset but the money.After a disastrous first game, Buttermaker climbs a tree to comfort Ahmed, the black kid from an athletic family who feels humiliated, by recounting ""Henry Aaron's 42 errors in sandlot ball.""  The scene lasts only a minute and a half and is so underplayed you could almost miss it, but it is hilarious and immensely touching.Kelly Leak, the athlete-delinquent, at first refuses to join the team but hangs around the ball field.  Motivation must be explained, and it can't be anything as squishy as loneliness. So when Amanda asks him why, the 12-year-old replies, ""There's a lot of ass around there.""  Perfect.Don't even THINK about wasting your time on Billy Bob Thortnon's dreadful 2005 remake, except for one thing.  It illuminates the laughable evolution of political correctness.  The original had little cursing and no adultery, but in the last scene Matthau was allowed to hand out beer to the the kids. Horrors! The remake is awash in obscenity and adultery, but the final scene was ""cleansed"" by substituting Near Beer.

In a following scene he is standing in the equipment room in front of signs indicating no drinking or smoking (with both beer and cigar in hand).

223227,A3VV4GUGLUVUP1,6300216810,Joel R. Bryan,"[42, 43]","The great Walter Matthau (all saggy jowls) plays Buttermaker, an ex-pitcher turned pool cleaner who tools around all day on his jobs in a chop-top station wagon with a cooler of beer in the backseat.  A local businessman talks (with money) Buttermaker into coaching a youth-league team of castaways.  Seems this is one community that takes its youth league baseball seriously.  A little too seriously.What follows is the familiar plot of a bunch of underdog kids coming together as the &quot;Team Nobody Believed In&quot; and contending for the championship against a team that represents everything that's wrong when parents spoil simple pleasures for their children (the Yankees, coached by Vic Morrow, in a neatly-observed performance).  Look, I don't know if &quot;Bears&quot; even did it first, but this movie certainly does it best, and without the labored sentimentality of its progeny.&quot;Bears&quot; never turns cartoonish.  It captures just the right atmosphere- slanting, late afternoon sunlight during the games, the bikes parked behind the dugouts, the post-game chants.  The kids, led by Tatum O'Neal and Jackie Earle Haley all perform well, and each has a sharply defined personality.  Even Morrow, as Buttermaker's antagonist, isn't portrayed as bad or evil- just a guy with misplaced priorities that make him act like a jerk.But Matthau makes this movie, conning kids into making martinis for him and cleaning pools while he regales them with increasingly drunken stories of his baseball glory days... until he passes out on the mound in a litter of beer cans.  Matthau plays Buttermaker as a modern day loser who discovers (eventually) he still has a better nature.Bright, smart and funny, &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; is a joy to watch, full of quick-witted exchanges and even heartbreak.  If you've seen one too many &quot;Mighty Ducks&quot; flicks, do yourself a favor and watch this one.  It goes down as smooth as one of Buttermaker's ice cold ones on a hot afternoon.And look for that kid who played Eddie in &quot;The Courtship of Eddie's Father&quot; as Morrow's son and the Yankees' star pitcher.  He has a ballpark epiphany that's true and heartbreaking.  Just another aspect of this marvelous little movie.",5,A Matthau Gem...

At the tender age of thirteen, I thought this was a hilarious send up of little league and organized sports. Now over twenty five years later, I still laugh out loud at the DVD version of the film, which has both biting moments and a lot of heart.The plot has now been endlessly copied by dozens of other movies.Walter Matthau plays an aging alcoholic, who is payed by a local politician to coach a little league team made up of misfits and losers.They are hopelessly bad players, who are dumped on by both other kids and adults alike.Through Mathau's drunken coaching and the help of an eleven year old girl with a killer curve ball (wonderfully played by Tatum O'neal) the team rises to the top of the stats and the big championship game. The late director, Michael Ritchie used this fairly simple plot device to present us with a scewering of the world of children's organized sports and a satire of suburban society in general.I love the scene where at the league party a female official presents a pizza made up with toppings to look like a ball field.She goes on to explain how she couldn't use anchovies in the presentation ""but hey, not many people like anchovies"".The film has many funny moments such as this, but it also carries a dark underbelly when it presents how serious the parents take games that are suppose to be fun and put their kids under a tremendous amount of pressure.It's hard to even watch a scene, in which an opposing team's coach, in the heat of game, goes out to the pitcher's mound and slaps his own son in the face.I don't mean to paint too dark of a picture of this movie. It is a really funny film. But under all the slapstick comedic moments that the film provides, Ritchie has something to say about how we treat our kids, that rings as true today (in the age of soccer moms) as it did over twenty five years ago.Matthau and O'neal are both excellent. The film has great supporting performances from actors Vic Morrow and Joyce Van Patton.Some of the stand out juvenile actors include Alfred Lutter, Jackie Earle Haley and Brandon Cruz.The script is smart and funny and makes us care about the characters.The movie is also an anthropological treasure trove of suburban America circa 1976 showing us such '70s fads as air hockey, hip hugger french jeans and mini bikes.The film has a very retro look.I highly reccomend this movie to both adults and older kids alike.",4,"""You Can Take Your Apology and that Trophy and Shove it ...""",1017619200,"04 1, 2002",2002,2470,"['saw', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'theatre', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1976', 'tender', 'age', 'thirteen', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'send', 'little', 'league', 'organized', 'sports', 'Now', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'out', 'loud', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'biting', 'moments', 'lot', 'heart.The', 'plot', 'now', 'been', 'endlessly', 'copied', 'dozens', 'other', 'movies.Walter', 'Matthau', 'aging', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'payed', 'local', 'politician', 'coach', 'little', 'league', 'team', 'made', 'misfits', 'losers.They', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'bad', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'dumped', 'other', 'kids', 'adults', 'Mathau', 'drunken', 'coaching', 'help', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'killer', 'curve', 'ball', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Tatum', ""O'neal"", 'team', 'top', 'stats', 'big', 'championship', 'game', 'late', 'director', 'Michael', 'Ritchie', 'used', 'fairly', 'simple', 'plot', 'device', 'present', 'scewering', 'world', 'children', 'organized', 'sports', 'satire', 'suburban', 'society', 'general.I', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'league', 'party', 'female', 'official', 'pizza', 'made', 'up', 'toppings', 'look', 'ball', 'field.She', 'explain', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'use', 'anchovies', 'presentation', 'hey', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'anchovies', '.The', 'film', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'such', 'also', 'dark', 'underbelly', 'when', 'how', 'serious', 'parents', 'take', 'games', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'fun', 'put', 'kids', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'pressure.It', 'hard', 'even', 'watch', 'scene', 'opposing', 'team', 'coach', 'heat', 'game', 'out', 'pitcher', 'mound', 'slaps', 'own', 'son', 'face.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'paint', 'too', 'dark', 'picture', 'movie', 'really', 'funny', 'film', 'slapstick', 'comedic', 'moments', 'film', 'Ritchie', 'something', 'say', 'how', 'treat', 'kids', 'true', 'today', 'age', 'soccer', 'moms', 'did', 'over', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'ago.Matthau', ""O'neal"", 'are', 'excellent', 'film', 'great', 'supporting', 'performances', 'actors', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patton.Some', 'stand', 'out', 'juvenile', 'actors', 'include', 'Alfred', 'Lutter', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Brandon', 'Cruz.The', 'script', 'smart', 'funny', 'care', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'also', 'anthropological', 'treasure', 'trove', 'suburban', 'America', 'circa', '1976', 'showing', 'such', ""'70s"", 'fads', 'air', 'hockey', 'hip', 'hugger', 'french', 'jeans', 'mini', 'bikes.The', 'film', 'very', 'retro', 'look.I', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'adults', 'older', 'kids', 'alike']",N/A

The Bad News Bears offers an amusing study in regards to what many Americans call pastime through a Little League baseball team that goes by the name Bears.  Instead of delivering a pleasurable time through baseball it becomes evident that winning is much more important, which the adults impose on their children.  In addition, the director Michael Ritchie depicts the opposite of working hard towards winning, which is doing nothing through Coach Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau).Coach Buttermaker is a former minor league baseball player that now supports himself by cleaning pools.  He has somehow gained the job as a Little League baseball coach, which he does with his cigar in one hand while the other holds his cool beer.  In other words, he does not care for much other than drinking himself into stupor and gaining nicotine induced relaxation.  However, the kids that he has been assigned to coach begin to look up to him, as he brags about his ancient baseball stories while they help him clean pools.When the first game comes around, it is evident that he has not coached or taught them anything.  The game becomes a lesson in humiliation, as they also realize that Coach Buttermaker is a phony.  Nonetheless, Buttermaker learns a valuable lesson from it himself, as he decides to change his approach and really help the kids. He teaches them how to field a ball and how to bat, but also how to get along.  It becomes a roller coaster that slowly ascends before the big pay off.The first thing that some might react to on watching The Bad News Bears is the explicit language presented in the film.  This could probably make some viewers somewhat upset, but it carries a message.  The message is that the children are products of society, which in turn is governed by adults.  Ritchie pushes this same message onto the baseball field where the lesson of winning and having fun are lesson's taught by adults.The film has the feel of a documentary, or something by Robert Altman where the audience does not get to know the audience in detail, but an emphasis is built on the environment where the characters coexist.  Yet, it is intended as a comedy, which could be a disastrous mix.  However, Michael Ritchie pulls it off by presenting a baseball film that meets somewhere on middle ground where the audience will learn that winning and having fun must meet on mutual ground for a pastime to exist.",4,The American Pastime Amusingly Coerced on Kids...,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,2555,"['Baseball', 'been', 'dubbed', 'American', 'Pastime', 'however', 'word', 'pastime', 'something', 'someone', 'pleasurable', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'amusing', 'study', 'regards', 'what', 'many', 'Americans', 'call', 'pastime', 'Little', 'League', 'baseball', 'team', 'name', 'Bears', 'Instead', 'delivering', 'pleasurable', 'time', 'baseball', 'evident', 'winning', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'adults', 'impose', 'children', 'addition', 'director', 'Michael', 'Ritchie', 'opposite', 'working', 'hard', 'towards', 'winning', 'doing', 'nothing', 'Coach', 'Morris', 'Buttermaker', 'Walter', 'Matthau', '.Coach', 'Buttermaker', 'former', 'minor', 'league', 'baseball', 'player', 'now', 'cleaning', 'pools', 'somehow', 'gained', 'job', 'Little', 'League', 'baseball', 'coach', 'cigar', 'one', 'hand', 'other', 'cool', 'beer', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'other', 'drinking', 'stupor', 'gaining', 'nicotine', 'induced', 'relaxation', 'However', 'kids', 'been', 'assigned', 'coach', 'begin', 'look', 'up', 'ancient', 'baseball', 'stories', 'help', 'clean', 'first', 'game', 'around', 'evident', 'not', 'coached', 'taught', 'anything', 'game', 'lesson', 'humiliation', 'also', 'realize', 'Coach', 'Buttermaker', 'phony', 'Nonetheless', 'Buttermaker', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'change', 'approach', 'really', 'help', 'kids', 'how', 'field', 'ball', 'how', 'bat', 'also', 'how', 'get', 'along', 'roller', 'coaster', 'slowly', 'big', 'pay', 'off.The', 'first', 'thing', 'might', 'react', 'watching', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'explicit', 'language', 'presented', 'film', 'could', 'probably', 'make', 'viewers', 'somewhat', 'upset', 'message', 'message', 'children', 'are', 'products', 'society', 'turn', 'governed', 'adults', 'Ritchie', 'same', 'message', 'baseball', 'field', 'where', 'lesson', 'winning', 'having', 'fun', 'are', 'lesson', 'taught', 'adults.The', 'film', 'feel', 'documentary', 'something', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'where', 'audience', 'not', 'get', 'know', 'audience', 'detail', 'emphasis', 'built', 'environment', 'where', 'characters', 'coexist', 'intended', 'comedy', 'could', 'be', 'disastrous', 'mix', 'However', 'Michael', 'Ritchie', 'off', 'presenting', 'baseball', 'film', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'ground', 'where', 'audience', 'will', 'learn', 'winning', 'having', 'fun', 'must', 'meet', 'mutual', 'ground', 'pastime', 'exist']",N/A
223235,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300216810,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","""The Bad News Bears"" was an interesting was a film that got everybody's attention in 1976 because hearing little kids curse, specifically Tanner Boyle (Chris Barnes), was pretty shocking.  But criticism of the film's profanity was tempered because of a scene during the big game when Joey Turner (Brandon Cruz), pitching for the Yankees against the Bears, is ordered by his father, Coach Roy Turner (Vic Morrow), to walk Engelberg (Gary Lee Cavagnaro), who has been hitting him hard in the game.  The next pitch goes right for Engelberg's head, and right after he ducks and curses, Coach Turner storms out to the mound to confront his son for throwing a bean ball in the most memorable scene in the film.This scene changed what people could say about this movie because it made a valid and important point about playing Little League in this country, namely that the worst part of the experience is having to deal with parents.  I still remember watching the fathers on a team we were playing reducing our starting pitcher to tears because of the way they taunted him throughout the game (our fathers were all in the Air Force and it suddenly dawns on me to wonder if these idiots outranked our pitcher's father).  The scene also mattered because in terms of the film the actions of Coach Turner made those of Coach Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau), who likes to share his beer with the kids and gets them to do his job of cleaning pools, look better.  Besides, when Buttermaker sees that he is starting to act way too much like Turner, it changes things and sets up the big finish.The idea that parents like to get in the way is set up earlier in the film when Councilman Whitewood (Ben Piazza) coaxes Buttermaker into coaching the Bears so that his kid can play too.  This despite the fact that we are talking about a team with the likes of Rudi Stein (David Pollock) and Timmy Lupus (Quinn Smith), who are as bad as it gets.  Buttermaker could care less to begin with, but eventually a buried spark of humanity is touched and he moves from being apathetic to stacking the deck by recruiting a pair of ringers.  The first is Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O'Neal), the daughter of an old girl friend who has a great fastball, and the second is the legendary local wannabe juvenille delinquent, Kelly Leek (Jackie Earle Haley), who can hit the ball over the fence and catch everything on this side of it in the outfield.So on the one hand ""Bad News Bears"" has little kids cursing, which is a bad thing, but it also exposes the fact that caring too much about winning when you are not even a teenager is a bad thing as well.  Arguing about which of those two bad things is worse than the other would be interesting, but probably futile (I think it would be one of those red state/blue state issues, where conservatives are upset about the cursing and liberals).  Of course things have changed such in the past three decades that the recent remake of this film with Billy Bob Thorton doing a mellower version of his ""Bad Santa"" character provokes neither the same response nor the same joy.  But then the original message was lost in the pair of rather insipid sequels that followed director Michael Ritchie's film, so the best advice is to watch the original, feel guilty about enjoying it, and stop while your are ahead of this particular game.",4,Beneath the profanity from the kids was a serious point about kids playing sports,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,3342,"['Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'film', 'got', 'everybody', 'attention', '1976', 'hearing', 'little', 'kids', 'curse', 'specifically', 'Tanner', 'Boyle', 'Chris', 'Barnes', 'was', 'pretty', 'shocking', 'criticism', 'film', 'profanity', 'was', 'tempered', 'scene', 'big', 'game', 'when', 'Joey', 'Turner', 'Brandon', 'Cruz', 'pitching', 'Yankees', 'Bears', 'ordered', 'father', 'Coach', 'Roy', 'Turner', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'walk', 'Engelberg', 'Gary', 'Lee', 'Cavagnaro', 'who', 'been', 'hitting', 'hard', 'game', 'next', 'pitch', 'right', 'Engelberg', 'head', 'right', 'curses', 'Coach', 'Turner', 'out', 'mound', 'confront', 'son', 'throwing', 'bean', 'ball', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'film.This', 'scene', 'changed', 'what', 'people', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'made', 'valid', 'important', 'point', 'playing', 'Little', 'League', 'country', 'namely', 'worst', 'part', 'experience', 'having', 'deal', 'parents', 'still', 'remember', 'watching', 'fathers', 'team', 'were', 'playing', 'reducing', 'starting', 'pitcher', 'tears', 'way', 'taunted', 'game', 'fathers', 'were', 'Air', 'Force', 'suddenly', 'wonder', 'idiots', 'outranked', 'pitcher', 'father', 'scene', 'also', 'mattered', 'terms', 'film', 'actions', 'Coach', 'Turner', 'made', 'Coach', 'Morris', 'Buttermaker', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'who', 'share', 'beer', 'kids', 'do', 'job', 'cleaning', 'pools', 'look', 'better', 'Besides', 'when', 'Buttermaker', 'starting', 'act', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Turner', 'things', 'up', 'big', 'finish.The', 'idea', 'get', 'way', 'set', 'up', 'earlier', 'film', 'when', 'Councilman', 'Whitewood', 'Ben', 'Piazza', 'coaxes', 'Buttermaker', 'coaching', 'Bears', 'kid', 'can', 'play', 'too', 'fact', 'are', 'talking', 'team', 'likes', 'Rudi', 'Stein', 'David', 'Pollock', 'Timmy', 'Lupus', 'Quinn', 'Smith', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'bad', 'Buttermaker', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'begin', 'eventually', 'buried', 'spark', 'humanity', 'touched', 'being', 'apathetic', 'stacking', 'deck', 'recruiting', 'pair', 'ringers', 'first', 'Amanda', 'Whurlitzer', 'Tatum', ""O'Neal"", 'daughter', 'old', 'girl', 'friend', 'who', 'great', 'fastball', 'second', 'legendary', 'local', 'wannabe', 'juvenille', 'delinquent', 'Kelly', 'Leek', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'who', 'can', 'hit', 'ball', 'fence', 'catch', 'everything', 'side', 'outfield.So', 'one', 'hand', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'little', 'kids', 'cursing', 'bad', 'thing', 'also', 'fact', 'caring', 'too', 'much', 'winning', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'teenager', 'bad', 'thing', 'as', 'well', 'Arguing', 'two', 'bad', 'things', 'worse', 'other', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'probably', 'futile', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'red', 'state/blue', 'state', 'issues', 'where', 'conservatives', 'are', 'upset', 'cursing', 'liberals', 'course', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'such', 'past', 'three', 'decades', 'recent', 'remake', 'film', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'doing', 'mellower', 'version', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'character', 'same', 'response', 'same', 'joy', 'then', 'original', 'message', 'was', 'lost', 'pair', 'rather', 'insipid', 'sequels', 'followed', 'director', 'Michael', 'Ritchie', 'film', 'best', 'advice', 'watch', 'original', 'feel', 'guilty', 'enjoying', 'stop', 'are', 'ahead', 'particular', 'game']",N/A

Just recently I've been watching it again, for what must be the first time in about 31 years(yikes).  Well, apparently, back when I was a kid, all the things in the movie seemed perfectly normal and healthy.  The 70s'll do that to a child.  See, what people who object to the movie's profanity, crude innuendoes about the sex life of an eleven-year-old girl (Played by Tatum O'Neal, who casually informs the coach that she knows some eleven-year-olds who are on the pill) racial slurs (a kid that looks like he's seven, who has a real toilet mouth on him, at one point complains that the team is full of, ""n*ggers, sp*cks, jews, and a spaz"") and the coach's obvious serious drinking problem, which leads him to spike his Budweiser with Jim Beam sitting in his car in the little league parking lot in the first scene, which leads to him getting a light for his cigar from a twelve-year-old delinquent (""thanks, mister"") who himself is to be found chain-smoking throughout the movie... as I say, what anyone who objects to these things must keep in mind is that the 70s were a very different time.  A strange time.  A depressing time.  A time when heavy smoking and drinking were not stigmatized as they are today.  A time when having a car-load of kids sitting on the rear hood as you swerve down the road while drinking a beer was not demonized as it is in these excessively prohibitionist times.  The movie must be seen as a message from another,  much grittier, much more dangerous, but somehow depressing rather than exhilarating time.  Anyone who was a kid in the 70s never really gets out of it.  Because the 70s are a Witch Mountain you never fully escape from, even though you've got that guy who looks like Uncle Bill from Family Affair helping you.  I think I can speak for anyone who was a kid in the 1970s when I say that in my mind there's a Bicentennial Celebration still going on.  And Evel Knievel is still jumping his rocket motorcycle over the Snake River Canyon.  And K.C. and the Sunshine Band is still playing.  I don't think anybody who wasn't a kid in the 70s can know what it was like to be there in that corner of time and space in the world.  To watch Starsky and Hutch and take it quite seriously.  To read Ramona the Brave - where Ramona's dad was unemployed and then finally gloriously got a job as a bag boy at the supermarket.  To not bat an eye about any of this.  To worry about the twin plagues of the metric system and the killer bees that were both on their way over, inexorably, and would someday get here and combine... if they didn't get lost in the Bermuda Triangle on the way.  Well, I guess the metric system did.So like I say, though I might want to leave the 70s, the 70s are like that crystal from outer space that steals your mind.  And though, like Logan, I want to bust out of that mall and find my way to Peter Ustinov, I know that I never will.  Because I just can't make sense of it.  I can't make any sense of it at all.  And until I can do that, until I can fathom what the 70s meant and what they stood for... I can never really leave.  Maybe tomorrow... tomorrow... tomorrow...

I believe that this movie is a time capsule. Its an era and time, long gone by. Sure, there is little league baseball today, but its not the same as it was back then. People who were kids back then (like me) can tell you that the whole scene was different back then, not like today. Sometimes I wonder if kids today really want to play, or their parents push them so hard to play, and the parents are the ones that really get off on it. Back when I was a kid, we wanted to play. Now, its big sponserships, and this and that. Differnt times back then, different vibe.

223244,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,6300216810,mirasreviews,"[3, 3]","""The Bad News Bears"" inspired a franchise of movies and the entire kids' sports comedy genre when it was released in 1976. Now it's a trip back in time to an era when preteens smoking and swearing was PG-rated family entertainment. It's amazing how much attitudes have changed in 30 years. As we are now at the opposite extreme in what is considered normal behavior in middle-class youngsters, ""The Bad News Bears"" seems like a breath of fresh air. And its message to adults who compete through their children's' achievements is more timely now than it was then.When a local politician (Ben Piazza) can't convince any parent to coach his son's Little League team, he hires former minor-league pitcher Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau), now a drunken ""broken-down third-rate ball player"". Buttermaker steels himself to coach the hopelessly untalented kids by spiking his ever-present beer with whisky. But he grows fond of the boys and regrets the constant ridicule they endure. So Buttermaker decides to turn the Bears into winners by recruiting 11-year-old Amanda (Tatum O'Neal) to pitch and a delinquent hot shot named Kelly (Jackie Earl Haley) to dominate the outfield.This movie has a laid-back tone that doesn't hit us with any real intensity or messages until late in the season. It encourages the children's idiosyncrasies and indulges Morris' alcoholic malaise. Tatum O'Neal exudes charisma as reluctant tomboy Amanda. Her sass and childish self-possession steal every scene she's in. ""The Bad News Bears"" should be mandatory viewing for the ""soccer mafia"", as parents who claim every inch of unused grassland for soccer fields are referred to in my area. In the end, this is a fun film that says it's ok to have fun. It's not necessary to have a cow about everything.

There were some memories, mostly of the bad words and the kid smoking and riding his motorcycle, but not much more.  There were sequels...right?  I remember sequels... couldn't tell you what they were about.  Anyway....I recently bought the DVD (it was way cheap, so what did I have to lose?) brought it home and popped it in and relived The Bad News Bears.  First off, I didn't remember most of it.  Walter Matthau is a burned-out pool-sweeper who used to be a minor-league pitcher at some point in his miserable alcoholic, cigar-smoking life.  The plot here was pretty thin.  First thing you know he's being paid to coach some little league misfits...enter The Bears.  1970's cinematic cliches abound...or were they created here?  Hard to say.  You got the fat kid, the booger-picking spaz, the shrimpy little scrapper who will start a fight with anyone no matter how much he's going to get wailed on (Little Joe from Bonanza syndrome, I think they call it, the geeky knows-all-about-baseball kid, the black kid, the Jewish kid, & two Mexican kids that don't speak english.  They suck.  In fact, they suck so much that they don't even get to bat in their first game because Matthau throws in the towel after the other team scores 23 points on them...  Enter Tatum O'Neil...the feisty girl with the golden arm and the razor-sharp tongue.  Great... now they have the pitcher from hell, but they can't hit the broad side of a barn, let alone a ball.  Enter The Hoodlum who happens to be the greatest ball player of all time...does any of this sound familiar?  It's been done more times now than we can count...but back in 1976 these were fresh ideas.  Vic Morrow is the coach of The Bears nemesis team.  His son is the pitcher (I'm pretty sure it's the kid from The Courtship Of Eddie's Father).  Tension. Wow!  The Bears make it to the playoffs against the best team in the league.  Matthau's character is a bully and a drunk and a lousy piece of sh*t.  The Bears are a bunch of rejects and juvinille delinquints.  It's great!  I really enjoyed looking back at this film.  It works.  The ending isn't what Hollywood would do today...and I'm sure the Billy Bob remake would make me vomit...but the original shines.

I hadn't seen it in over twenty years, so I remembered very little about it. Quite a surprise, it was. I'm amazed it scored a PG rating (even better, Quebec gave it a G, according to IMDB); that'd never happen today.I'm not sure what it is about sports movies. I hate sports, most of them, but a good sports movie will get me every time. I'm not overly fond of comedies, either, but you combine sports and comedy, and something always clicks. The Bad News Bears is no exception, with eternally-drunk washed-up minor-leaguer Buttermaker (Walter Matthau) and his cadre of misfit kids, most of whom band together to become one of the best ensemble casts of the seventies despite their tender ages. And my god, what these kids do! One of the funniest lines in the movie comes from the eternally-foulmouthed Tanner (Chris Barnes, who retired from acting after high school), and can in no way be repeated here without tripping Amazon's obscenity filter; let's just say that if there's a slur to be had, he pops it out (and it's tossed right back at him by team statistician Ogilvie [Alfred Lutter, who retired after the Bad News Bears sequel in 1977], which simultaneously declaws the line and makes it okay for the audience to laugh, even in the age of political correctness). Team bad boy Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley, who ended thirteen years of retirement with a critically-lauded performance in 2006's Little Children) actually smokes throughout the entire movie! As a teen! A YOUNG teen! (One assumes he's supposed to be younger in the movie than he actually was-- sixteen-- when making the movie.) Not only are the kids foulmouthed, but Buttermaker is foulmouthed around the kids. (Watch recent movies where adults are supposedly swearing around kids. Note the widespread use of cuts. I have hypothesized for at least a decade that kids are no longer allowed to be in the room when an adult swears in any big-budget picture.) It's stunning. It's offensive. It's... hysterical. Unless, of course, it's not supposed to be. And that's what makes you realize that the Bad News Bears is not just your usual fluffy sports comedy (e.g., Major League, as much as I adore that movie); when we get to the big emotional scene between Buttermaker and his ex-girlfriend's daughter Amanda (Tatum O'Neal), it works. There's sadness and drama and a great deal of anger, and it's entirely believable. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this any more, movies that take for granted that hey, kids already know all these words, and do, in fact, use them (probably more than most adults). But more so, it seems to have had an increasingly hard time making movies with this kind of emotional honesty.

Still, the intense feelings baseball brings out in people, to where the kids are being yelled at and treated like they were major fielders rather than really a bunch of 11 year old kids.Matthau's character realizes this late in the game where he finds himself yelling and telling his kids to purposely hurt themselves to win the game.  He later knocks it off and just lets them be kids.The opposing coach though lets his emotions get in the way of being a parent and slaps his kid for not pitching correctly.  Sonafabitch!Lots of damn swearing and up your ass but that's the reality of kids baseball!The film is not pretentious and if anything says a few positive things about fathers and daughters as well as the spirit of the game.

223261,ABKDVUJXBA1SZ,6300216810,Titus,"[1, 2]","""The Bad News Bears"" is a heartfelt, poignant movie about how one man comes to find redemption through that most hallowed of American institutions, little league baseball. The film is anchored by Walther Matthau who is perfectly cast as Morris Buttermaker, a washed up ex-minor league pitcher frittering away what is left of his life cleaning pools in suburban southern California. He agrees to coach a little league baseball team to make a few extra bucks.All Buttermaker wants to do is show up, drink beer and collect his money. His attitude changes, however, as he watches his team get laughed at and humiliated by the little league ""powers that be."" He decides that he is not going to stand by and watch his players start down the same path to nowhere he has taken.Matthau is supported by a great cast including first and foremost, the child actors fronted by Tatum O'Neal as the daughter of Buttermaker's ex-girlfriend. The kids pull off the difficult task of portraying the collection of misfits, social outcasts and ner-do-wells as both obnoxious and yet endearingly innocent and charming all at the same time.Vic Morrow is excellent as the coach of the Bear's archenemies the Yankees. The scene where he forces his pitcher son to intentionally walk Engelburg, the kid he most wishes to strike out, is one of the most powerful in any movie about children, sports, and a ""win at all costs"" attitude. Joyce Van Patten is also wonderful as the annoying busybody who runs the league.Overall ""The Bad News Bears"" is a terrific movie not just as a nostalgia trip for those like myself who grew up playing little league in the '70's but also for its positive message.
