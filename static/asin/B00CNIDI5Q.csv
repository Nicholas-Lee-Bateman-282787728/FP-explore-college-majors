While you know since it is brought to us by PureFlix that it is a Christian based movie, it is not one whose theme is in your face.  It is more thought provoking and a good one to watch with family and friends.  The discussion potential is great - making mistakes, forgiveness of others, forgiveness of oneself, marriage.

1649737,A2QE9AL0DEJOUG,B00CNIDI5Q,RedCheckLady,"[1, 1]",Angus Macfadyen (Lucas Blackstone-the kidnapper) and Haylie Duff (Carrie-the wife) did a great job on thier acting. I dont know if this is a true story or not-at the end it did feel like it might have been. I did not watch &#34;behind the scenes or Actor interviews) to find out more about this movie.It is hard for a wife or husband to forgive infidelity. I truly only believe that it would be ALMOST impossiable to do that without the Lord's help. I am speaking from being a wife myself and married for over 10 years.This movie does show how HARD that forgiveness can be...even to forgive yourself of something you did can be ROUGH. This is a movie of forgiveness and Love. I wish the movie would have went a little more into the &#34;forgive yourself&#34; aspect but over all-we enjoyed watching it.This movie does not &#34;capture&#34; you to the point where you cant get up and walk away but it does hold your interest and makes you think. I dont believe that any kids(under 12) would find this movie enjoyable-due to the fact it is kind of slow moving at points and the subject of infidality. It is a clean movie . Final thoughts--it is a good movie and does cover a good subject.,5,It can be hard to forgive yourself or a spouse.,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,1186,"['Angus', 'Macfadyen', 'Lucas', 'Blackstone-the', 'kidnapper', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'Carrie-the', 'wife', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'thier', 'acting', 'dont', 'know', 'true', 'story', 'not-at', 'end', 'did', 'feel', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'did', 'not', 'watch', '34', 'scenes', 'Actor', 'interviews', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'movie.It', 'hard', 'wife', 'husband', 'forgive', 'infidelity', 'truly', 'only', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'ALMOST', 'impossiable', 'do', 'Lord', 'help', 'am', 'speaking', 'being', 'wife', 'married', '10', 'years.This', 'movie', 'show', 'how', 'HARD', 'forgiveness', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'forgive', 'something', 'did', 'can', 'be', 'ROUGH', 'movie', 'forgiveness', 'Love', 'wish', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'went', 'little', 'more', '34', 'forgive', '34', 'aspect', 'all-we', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'it.This', 'movie', 'not', '34', 'capture', '34', 'point', 'where', 'cant', 'get', 'up', 'walk', 'away', 'hold', 'interest', 'think', 'dont', 'believe', 'kids', '12', 'would', 'find', 'movie', 'enjoyable-due', 'fact', 'kind', 'slow', 'moving', 'points', 'subject', 'infidality', 'clean', 'movie', 'Final', 'thoughts', 'good', 'movie', 'cover', 'good', 'subject']",Taken By Grace

The wife wore clothing that exposed cleavage and gave a worldly appeal to the movie.  The message was good in that the man that was kidnapping the couple came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, but the message was weak.  He was drinking throughout the movie and even at the end when the husband told the man that God had forgiven him.  This is not the gospel message in that one must repent and turn from sin to be forgiven.  The message at the end did say that the man became born again while serving another prison sentence.  So, it was made more clear, but could be easily missed if you didn't read the very last written message.
