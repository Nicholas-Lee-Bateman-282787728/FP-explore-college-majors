As soon as I discovered there was a third movie I ordered it. Unfortunately, I did not have anything of the first 2 movies. The 'magic of Avonlea' was gone. The plotline was horrible. Anne and Gilbert got married and ...NOTHING. It was all about the war, war, war. I must admit I had my hand on the remote to fast forward a few times. I could not understand how they could have done this!!!! Some parts were boring and it was as if Anne was not Anne anymore. Now I am trying to forget the movie. The books are a lot better.",2,Whatever happened to...,999734400,"09 6, 2001",2001,623,"['have', 'always', 'LOVED', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Read', 'books', 'was', 'enchanted', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'As', 'soon', 'discovered', 'was', 'third', 'movie', 'ordered', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'first', '2', 'movies', ""'magic"", 'Avonlea', 'was', 'gone', 'plotline', 'was', 'horrible', 'Anne', 'Gilbert', 'got', 'married', 'NOTHING', 'was', 'war', 'war', 'war', 'must', 'admit', 'had', 'hand', 'remote', 'fast', 'forward', 'few', 'times', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'parts', 'were', 'boring', 'was', 'Anne', 'was', 'not', 'Anne', 'anymore', 'Now', 'am', 'trying', 'forget', 'movie', 'books', 'are', 'lot', 'better']",N/A
663624,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B00005LKIO,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[14, 20]","Finally the long awaited conclusion of the Anne of Green Gables series is here at last! Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story aired in 2000 on PBS! Anne returns to her beloved Prince Edward Island after her 5year departure to find the island almost completly differnt.....This film has absolutly nothing to do with the books. Kevin Sullivan the films producer stated that Montgomery's Story was much to unrealistic.. This approach worked in some ways, and REALLY didn't in others! For instance, it works in the sense that the story is amazing and makes for a interesting world war 1 film....It doesn't in the sense that, other than the characters, you don't feel like your watching a Anne of Green Gables film.Now back to the story.....Anne and her soon to be husband travel to New York City where Gilbert is training to be a doctor, in the mean time Anne takes a position as a editor at a large publishing house...While in her spare time Anne works on a novel under the coaching of the firms best writer Jack Garrison whom as is expected falls in love with Anne! Well After a interesting event happens Anne and Gil move back to a war torn Avonlea!  After the inlistment of Diana's husband Fred, Gil inlists! When Gilbert is then missing in action it is up to her to save her beloved! While there She runs in to her old buddy Jack Garrison. When Jack leaves her with his baby, Anne must globe trot through France, Germany, and the UK with the kid!See what I mean, Not the cute little red head getting into trouble we're used to! The film doesn't bring back many old faces, just Anne, Gil, Diana, Fred (played much better by this actor than the old), Josie Pye, Mudy, and Rachel Lynde (who's part is disgustinly small for a character who played such a large role in the first 2 film). The movie also suffers due to the fact that Collen Dewhurst (Marilla Cuthburt) is not in the film due to her 1991 death! In the books Marilla was still alive at this point, so really there wasn't any way to take the book approach. I definatly think this film should not be the conclusion to the series.  It leaves to many wholes to be filled, and the book Rilla of Ingleside would make one heck of a movie!But all in all,See this movie....Rather you like the books or the movies. If your a die hard fan of the books, just look at it as a Alternate direction for Anne!",4,A fitting end to the series,994291200,"07 5, 2001",2001,2356,"['Finally', 'long', 'awaited', 'conclusion', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'series', 'here', 'last', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Continuing', 'Story', 'aired', '2000', 'PBS', 'Anne', 'beloved', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', '5year', 'departure', 'find', 'island', 'almost', 'completly', 'differnt', '..This', 'film', 'absolutly', 'nothing', 'do', 'books', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'films', 'producer', 'stated', 'Montgomery', 'Story', 'was', 'much', 'unrealistic..', 'approach', 'worked', 'ways', 'REALLY', 'did', ""n't"", 'others', 'instance', 'sense', 'story', 'amazing', 'interesting', 'world', 'war', '1', 'film', '.It', ""n't"", 'sense', 'other', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'watching', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'back', 'story', '..Anne', 'soon', 'be', 'husband', 'travel', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'Gilbert', 'training', 'be', 'doctor', 'mean', 'time', 'Anne', 'position', 'editor', 'large', 'publishing', 'house', 'spare', 'time', 'Anne', 'novel', 'coaching', 'firms', 'best', 'writer', 'Jack', 'Garrison', 'whom', 'expected', 'falls', 'love', 'Anne', 'Well', 'interesting', 'event', 'Anne', 'Gil', 'move', 'back', 'war', 'torn', 'Avonlea', 'inlistment', 'Diana', 'husband', 'Fred', 'Gil', 'When', 'Gilbert', 'then', 'missing', 'action', 'up', 'save', 'beloved', 'old', 'buddy', 'Jack', 'Garrison', 'When', 'Jack', 'baby', 'Anne', 'must', 'globe', 'trot', 'France', 'Germany', 'UK', 'kid', 'See', 'what', 'mean', 'Not', 'cute', 'little', 'red', 'head', 'getting', 'trouble', ""'re"", 'used', 'film', ""n't"", 'bring', 'back', 'many', 'old', 'just', 'Anne', 'Gil', 'Diana', 'Fred', 'played', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'old', 'Josie', 'Pye', 'Mudy', 'Rachel', 'Lynde', 'who', 'part', 'disgustinly', 'small', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'large', 'role', 'first', '2', 'film', 'movie', 'also', 'suffers', 'due', 'fact', 'Collen', 'Dewhurst', 'Marilla', 'Cuthburt', 'not', 'film', 'due', '1991', 'death', 'books', 'Marilla', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'point', 'so', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'way', 'take', 'book', 'approach', 'definatly', 'think', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'conclusion', 'series', 'many', 'wholes', 'be', 'filled', 'book', 'Rilla', 'Ingleside', 'would', 'make', 'one', 'heck', 'movie', 'See', 'movie', '.Rather', 'like', 'books', 'movies', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'books', 'just', 'look', 'Alternate', 'direction', 'Anne']",N/A
663625,A1TRPKDQWEP23V,B00005LKIO,Meerkat,"[3, 5]","I was very excited to see that a third installment of Anne of Green Gables had been made and went out of my way to get a copy of it (it was not available in the US when I purchased mine).  It's an interesting enough story, but at times it is almost as if everyone is trying too hard to make the script work.  I realize that this takes place during a time of war, but this installment does not have the charm and wit that the other Anne of Green Gables did, and that is a pity considering the wonderful talents of Megan Follows and Johnathon Crombie as Anne and Gilbert.  The story has a habit of jumping all over the place and doesn't seem to flow very well.  We're in Avonlea, we're in New York, we're back in Avonlea, we're in Paris, we're in London, we're in Germany..... (you get the picture).  I loved these characters the way they were written by Lucy Maud Montgomery.  This installment just seems as though it should have been titled &quot;The Adventures of Anne&quot; because it is trying so hard to show the audience that Anne can do it all.  For a few moments I was half expecting Anne to end the war all on her own.  I'm not sorry I purchased it, but as I said before, this was all right, but it could have been so much better.",3,It's okay... could have been better........,994464000,"07 7, 2001",2001,1238,"['was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'third', 'installment', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'went', 'way', 'get', 'copy', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'US', 'when', 'purchased', 'mine', 'interesting', 'enough', 'story', 'times', 'almost', 'everyone', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'script', 'work', 'realize', 'place', 'time', 'war', 'installment', 'not', 'have', 'charm', 'wit', 'other', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'did', 'pity', 'considering', 'wonderful', 'talents', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'Johnathon', 'Crombie', 'Anne', 'Gilbert', 'story', 'habit', 'jumping', 'place', ""n't"", 'seem', 'flow', 'very', 'well', ""'re"", 'Avonlea', ""'re"", 'New', 'York', ""'re"", 'back', 'Avonlea', ""'re"", 'Paris', ""'re"", 'London', ""'re"", 'Germany', '..', 'get', 'picture', 'loved', 'characters', 'way', 'were', 'written', 'Lucy', 'Maud', 'Montgomery', 'installment', 'just', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'quot', 'Adventures', 'Anne', 'quot', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'show', 'audience', 'Anne', 'can', 'do', 'few', 'moments', 'was', 'half', 'expecting', 'Anne', 'end', 'war', 'own', ""'m"", 'not', 'sorry', 'purchased', 'said', 'before', 'was', 'right', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",N/A
663626,A23AFVXWF9A0CF,B00005LKIO,Sallie A. Neal,"[3, 5]","I was very skeptical of Anne the Continuing Story since it didn't follow any of L.M. Montgomery's books and everyone seemed to think that it made a big difference, but I REALLY enjoyed it and felt that it fit in with the other stories with no problem.  The original chracters are in it (all except Diana's husband, and we didn't see much of him in the others anyway)and they all did a wonderful job in picking the story back up again.  It didn't get boring, the story was always moving.  If you enjoyed Anne of Green Gables for the acting, and the story itself and it doesn't matter if this particular story  was a L.M. Montogomery book (like the other reviewer), then I definitely recommend it.

663627,A16KH9DGUDMAQ2,B00005LKIO,"V. Garlock ""Radical Feminist""","[14, 15]","when you created this movie.. SHAME ON YOU!I have always loved the original Anne of Green Gables, and its sequel, Anne of Avonlea. Both were 2 VERY high quality films, and each really did a splendid job of bringing L.M. Montgomery's magical books to life. (Magical in the sense that one really feels that they are with Anne whatever she goes though.) I was really looking forward to this movie, when I heard there would be another, but it fell quite short of my expectations in every measure.First, L.M. Montgomery does deal with Anne in her later years, and yes, World War 1,in the Anne series, but it is not in the way this movie does. In the books, Anne becomes a mother and she raises many children. The books talk about Anne's children growing up, Anne's reaction to growing old, and finally, her suffering at seeing her children go fight in World War 1--in RILLA OF INGLESIDE. (In the last 3 books of the series, there is more attention on the children than Anne, although Anne is no minor role in any of the last 3 books.) However, these being children's books, don't put too much stock in the suffering part--everyone still keeps hope up. It doesn't go into the bloody details of war either. And the books aren't quite as serious as I making them sound, there are plenty of moments for the little things--this is Anne Shirley, after all.But in the film, which could have so beautifully portrayed the idyll and changing times of Anne's later years--Kevin Sullivan, the writer, director, producer of this and the other Anne movies, makes her into an adventure heroine. It is like he got really cocky and thought, &quot;I don't need to use those books, I can make a good film without them.&quot; Well, he couldn't have even made the first one if he didn't use the book.Many familiar characters are back, but as much as I loved seeing them again, they didn't have the depth and emotion of the 2 previous films. In fact, most of them seemed to be trying to have deep emotion, but the plot was too ridiculous for them to be able to.A summary of the plot is, Anne and Gilbert go to New York for five years. Anne gets a novel published, but not the credit for it...She and Gilbert go back to Avonlea...a few things happen, and obviously a LOT has changed.. He goes off to fight in the war, she loses contact with him, recieves bad news, goes over to Europe to find him, and fall in love with the guy who stole her novel credit. (He is fighting in the war too. And of course Anne and he start liking each other as if the past never happened.) And then a whole lot more happens, then we come back to Avonlea again. This is a poor sum up of the plot, but I don't want to spoil it for you, if you do decide to see it.I am not against skipping this film, but it not the classic that the first and second movie were. I HIGHLY reccomand reading ANNE'S HOUSE OF DREAMS, ANNE OF INGLESIDE, RAINBOW VALLEY, and RILLA OF INGLESIDE before you watch this film. Thus, you can compare L.M. Montgomery's prose to Kevin Sullivan's, and deciding for yourself who did the better job. Maybe, I would have liked this film more if I hadn't read the series that that these films are based upon, but as you might have guessed I don't care for this film version all that greatly. But it is all up to you to decide.",2,Kevin Sullivan--what were you thinking...,998179200,"08 19, 2001",2001,3289,"['when', 'created', 'movie..', 'SHAME', 'ON', 'YOU', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'original', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'sequel', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'Both', 'were', '2', 'VERY', 'high', 'quality', 'films', 'really', 'did', 'splendid', 'job', 'bringing', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'magical', 'books', 'life', 'Magical', 'sense', 'one', 'really', 'are', 'Anne', 'though', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'when', 'heard', 'would', 'be', 'fell', 'quite', 'short', 'expectations', 'measure.First', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'deal', 'Anne', 'later', 'years', 'yes', 'World', 'War', '1', 'Anne', 'series', 'not', 'way', 'movie', 'books', 'Anne', 'mother', 'many', 'children', 'books', 'talk', 'Anne', 'children', 'growing', 'up', 'Anne', 'reaction', 'growing', 'old', 'finally', 'suffering', 'seeing', 'children', 'go', 'fight', 'World', 'War', '1', 'RILLA', 'OF', 'INGLESIDE', 'last', '3', 'books', 'series', 'more', 'attention', 'children', 'Anne', 'Anne', 'minor', 'role', 'last', '3', 'books', 'However', 'being', 'children', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'too', 'much', 'stock', 'suffering', 'part', 'everyone', 'still', 'hope', 'up', ""n't"", 'go', 'bloody', 'details', 'war', 'books', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'serious', 'making', 'sound', 'are', 'plenty', 'moments', 'little', 'things', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'all.But', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'so', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'idyll', 'changing', 'times', 'Anne', 'later', 'years', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'other', 'Anne', 'movies', 'adventure', 'heroine', 'got', 'really', 'cocky', 'thought', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'use', 'books', 'can', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'them.', 'quot', 'Well', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'made', 'first', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'book.Many', 'familiar', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'as', 'much', 'loved', 'seeing', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'depth', 'emotion', '2', 'previous', 'films', 'fact', 'most', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'have', 'deep', 'emotion', 'plot', 'was', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'be', 'able', 'to.A', 'summary', 'plot', 'Anne', 'Gilbert', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'five', 'years', 'Anne', 'novel', 'published', 'not', 'credit', 'Gilbert', 'go', 'back', 'Avonlea', 'few', 'things', 'happen', 'obviously', 'LOT', 'changed..', 'fight', 'war', 'contact', 'bad', 'news', 'Europe', 'find', 'fall', 'love', 'guy', 'who', 'stole', 'novel', 'credit', 'fighting', 'war', 'too', 'course', 'Anne', 'start', 'liking', 'other', 'past', 'never', 'happened', 'then', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'happens', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'Avonlea', 'again', 'poor', 'sum', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'do', 'decide', 'see', 'it.I', 'am', 'not', 'skipping', 'film', 'not', 'classic', 'first', 'second', 'movie', 'were', 'HIGHLY', 'reccomand', 'reading', 'ANNE', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'DREAMS', 'ANNE', 'OF', 'INGLESIDE', 'RAINBOW', 'VALLEY', 'RILLA', 'OF', 'INGLESIDE', 'watch', 'film', 'Thus', 'can', 'compare', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'prose', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'deciding', 'who', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'more', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'series', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'might', 'have', 'guessed', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'version', 'greatly', 'up', 'decide']",N/A
