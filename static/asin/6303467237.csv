376024,A1635YKA4UAXVY,6303467237,Earl James,"[0, 0]","I felt a contrarian review was needed after seeing all the glowing reviews of this film.  One reviewer says that the movie was stupid, with cheap laughs, but gives it 5 stars???  Cheap laughs come from very staged scenes.  They wanted to show people being startled, so they have the older boy cleaning the tub at 6 a.m. by getting inside the tub, closing the shower curtain and making no noise - don't think much cleaning is going to get done.  But it does allow the mother and the boy to be startled when she opens the shower curtain and finds him in the tub.Aside from the adorable, talented canine playing the family dog, the acting is not good.  Still, it's a clean movie that children may find entertaining.",1,For children only.,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,712,"['felt', 'contrarian', 'review', 'was', 'needed', 'seeing', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'film', 'One', 'reviewer', 'movie', 'was', 'stupid', 'cheap', 'laughs', '5', 'stars', 'Cheap', 'come', 'very', 'staged', 'scenes', 'wanted', 'show', 'people', 'being', 'startled', 'have', 'older', 'boy', 'cleaning', 'tub', '6', 'a.m.', 'getting', 'tub', 'closing', 'shower', 'curtain', 'making', 'noise', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'cleaning', 'going', 'get', 'done', 'allow', 'mother', 'boy', 'be', 'startled', 'when', 'shower', 'curtain', 'tub.Aside', 'adorable', 'talented', 'canine', 'playing', 'family', 'dog', 'acting', 'not', 'good', 'Still', 'clean', 'movie', 'children', 'may', 'find', 'entertaining']",Split Infinity: A Gift from the Past Feature Films for Families  VHS
376025,AAVVI0JO946NU,6303467237,James E Hook,"[1, 1]","Time travel has been a fairly reliable way to let a character see through the eyes of another or time of another. Kirsten Dunst did a supberb job of this in the Holacaust story The Devil's Arithmetic. Neither the story line nor the acting in Split Infinity measures up to that one. Fortunately the acting is not over the top or overly emotive. The main actress here does a reliable job in a script that could have dealt more solidly with the shock of a girl finding herself in another time. It also fails to adequately delve into the greed and corruption that is placing the family in peril. The grandfather/brother's selfishness and then later act of contrition, the central line of the story, was handled in a way that is too simplistic to teach a lesson. And as the DVD's cover proclaims, this is all about teaching your children values.The children did seem to be enjoying themselves in those pre-recession times, especially compared with those in the modern times when their commercialism was strictly over the top. Come on. How many schools allow that open marketing out of the kids lockers.",3,Dependable Family Fare,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,1097,"['Time', 'travel', 'been', 'fairly', 'reliable', 'way', 'let', 'character', 'see', 'eyes', 'time', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'did', 'supberb', 'job', 'Holacaust', 'story', 'Devil', 'Arithmetic', 'story', 'line', 'acting', 'Split', 'Infinity', 'up', 'one', 'Fortunately', 'acting', 'not', 'top', 'overly', 'emotive', 'main', 'actress', 'here', 'reliable', 'job', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'dealt', 'more', 'solidly', 'shock', 'girl', 'finding', 'time', 'also', 'adequately', 'delve', 'greed', 'corruption', 'placing', 'family', 'peril', 'grandfather/brother', 'selfishness', 'then', 'later', 'act', 'contrition', 'central', 'line', 'story', 'was', 'handled', 'way', 'too', 'simplistic', 'teach', 'lesson', 'DVD', 'cover', 'teaching', 'children', 'children', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'enjoying', 'pre-recession', 'times', 'especially', 'compared', 'modern', 'times', 'when', 'commercialism', 'was', 'strictly', 'top', 'Come', 'How', 'many', 'schools', 'allow', 'open', 'marketing', 'kids', 'lockers']",Split Infinity: A Gift from the Past Feature Films for Families  VHS
