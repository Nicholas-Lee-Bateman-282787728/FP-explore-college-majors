Well, imagine if there was such a thing as spontaneous HUMAN combustion!  Pretty scary, huh?For Sam, it's not only scary, it's reality.Sam always knew that there was something wrong with him, but he couldn't quite figure out the origin of his problem.  After years of research, Sam discovers that his parents had been used in a number of atomic-weapons experiments shortly before he was born.  The government was attempting to engineer the perfect weapon for war.  When the project fails, the government hides all evidence of the project, and it becomes a tightly-kept secret.Or did it?No!As a result of Sam's parents' repeated exposure to radiation, both of their genetic codes were changed, eventually being passed onto their first (and only) child, Sam.  Because of the radiation running through his veins, Sam discovers that he has the uncanny ability to make things AND PEOPLE burst into flames.Talk about getting ""hot under the collar""!""Spontaneous Combustion"" is a masterful horror/sci-fi movie by one of the most talented filmmakers in the industry - Tobe Hooper (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Poltergeist"").",5,CAUTION: Contents of this movie may be hot!,1035504000,"10 25, 2002",2002,1433,"['spontaneous', 'combustionFunction', 'noun', 'self-ignition', 'combustible', 'material', 'chemical', 'action', 'oxidation', 'constituents', 'called', 'also', 'spontaneous', 'ignitionThe', 'thought', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'such', 'pile', 'rags', 'old', 'collection', 'tools', 'spontaneously', 'bursting', 'flames', 'terrifying', 'Well', 'imagine', 'was', 'such', 'thing', 'spontaneous', 'HUMAN', 'combustion', 'Pretty', 'scary', 'huh', 'Sam', 'not', 'only', 'scary', 'reality.Sam', 'always', 'knew', 'was', 'something', 'wrong', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'origin', 'problem', 'years', 'research', 'Sam', 'parents', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'number', 'atomic-weapons', 'experiments', 'shortly', 'was', 'born', 'government', 'was', 'attempting', 'engineer', 'perfect', 'weapon', 'war', 'When', 'project', 'government', 'evidence', 'project', 'tightly-kept', 'secret.Or', 'did', 'No', 'result', 'Sam', 'parents', 'repeated', 'exposure', 'radiation', 'genetic', 'codes', 'were', 'changed', 'eventually', 'being', 'passed', 'first', 'only', 'child', 'Sam', 'radiation', 'running', 'veins', 'Sam', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'make', 'things', 'PEOPLE', 'burst', 'flames.Talk', 'getting', 'hot', 'collar', 'Spontaneous', 'Combustion', 'masterful', 'horror/sci-fi', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'industry', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Poltergeist']",N/A

One loop hole is 2 caracters are riding in a car, and one begins shooting flames all over the place. Neither gets even scorched.  But by the end of the movie, the one character is burnt pretty bad.On the other hand, the movie takes a creepy surreality at times that if it had maintained, this wold have been a classic. Example is at one point 2 characters are discussing the situation, and in the middle of the conversation voices from the radio add clues to the mystery. The 1950's Area 51 atmosphere is a plus.The ending makes no real sence.I do like ths movie, and love parts, but over all, the end was crap.",3,Very strange,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,705,"['liked', 'movie', 'were', 'alot', 'loop', 'holes', 'logic', 'end', 'was', 'horrible', 'One', 'loop', 'hole', '2', 'caracters', 'are', 'riding', 'car', 'one', 'shooting', 'flames', 'place', 'even', 'scorched', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'character', 'burnt', 'pretty', 'bad.On', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'creepy', 'surreality', 'times', 'had', 'maintained', 'wold', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'Example', 'one', 'point', '2', 'characters', 'are', 'discussing', 'situation', 'middle', 'conversation', 'voices', 'radio', 'add', 'clues', 'mystery', '1950', 'Area', '51', 'atmosphere', 'plus.The', 'ending', 'real', 'sence.I', 'do', 'ths', 'movie', 'love', 'parts', 'end', 'was', 'crap']",N/A
717641,A203M4P4QFEQMW,B00006JDRY,"Risa Reif ""Ninja Chick""","[1, 8]","This movie starts with this ugly little man who is annoying not to listen to, but also to look at. (You might recognize him from his best work in ""Silent Night Deadly Night Part 5"" with Mickey Rooney. [An equally unattractive man]) His wife is a pretty one in which in real life he would not have a chance. They have a kid during some radiation experimentation and end up with a kid that looks like Brad Douriff. (Coincidence? I think not). Later on Brad Douriff is a student/teacher (we really don't know what the heck he's doing there at the a college/high school [i think it's a college]). All we know is that he is an ugly man with a relationship with a pretty woman (in which we know he would have no chance with in real life [coincidence i think not] [the men his family must have a good personality]). And all the students at the school are wearing nazi-esque patches that are to protest the Nuclear  Power Plant that is to be built. (Why you may ask? Good question.) Anyways, whenever Douriff gets mad he sets people aflame. (So maybe the men in his family don't have the best of personalities) So the movie goes on to ""explain"" why he is ripping off Drew Barrymore from ""Firestarter"", but end screwing it all up and making no sense whatsoever. Also you find out that his ex-wife's grandfather raised him and his current girlfriend, even though they didn't know about each other. So his girlfriend is a sister/girlfriend/enemy-because-she-knew-about-his-condition/ex-wifes competion for affection. Got that?? Good. The ending is horrific in the sense of ""Get me out of here before I burst into flames of confusion and frustration!""If you liked this movie I recomend: The Mangler (another Tobe Hooper classic/mistake.What I learned from Spontanious Combustion: Brad Douriff looks better and better as he decomposes.",1,Spontanious Human Combstupid,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,1822,"['movie', 'ugly', 'little', 'man', 'who', 'annoying', 'not', 'listen', 'also', 'look', 'might', 'recognize', 'best', 'work', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Deadly', 'Night', 'Part', '5', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', '[', 'equally', 'unattractive', 'man', ']', 'wife', 'pretty', 'one', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'chance', 'have', 'kid', 'radiation', 'experimentation', 'end', 'up', 'kid', 'Brad', 'Douriff', 'Coincidence', 'think', 'not', 'Later', 'Brad', 'Douriff', 'student/teacher', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'heck', 'doing', 'there', 'college/high', 'school', '[', 'i', 'think', 'college', ']', 'know', 'ugly', 'man', 'relationship', 'pretty', 'woman', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'chance', 'real', 'life', '[', 'coincidence', 'i', 'think', 'not', ']', 'men', 'family', 'must', 'have', 'good', 'personality', ']', 'students', 'school', 'are', 'wearing', 'nazi-esque', 'patches', 'are', 'protest', 'Nuclear', 'Power', 'Plant', 'be', 'built', 'Why', 'may', 'ask', 'Good', 'question', 'Anyways', 'whenever', 'Douriff', 'mad', 'people', 'aflame', 'maybe', 'men', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'personalities', 'movie', 'explain', 'why', 'ripping', 'off', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Firestarter', 'end', 'screwing', 'up', 'making', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'Also', 'find', 'out', 'ex-wife', 'grandfather', 'raised', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'girlfriend', 'sister/girlfriend/enemy-because-she-knew-about-his-condition/ex-wifes', 'competion', 'affection', 'Got', 'Good', 'ending', 'horrific', 'sense', 'Get', 'here', 'burst', 'flames', 'confusion', 'frustration', 'liked', 'movie', 'recomend', 'Mangler', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'classic/mistake.What', 'learned', 'Spontanious', 'Combustion', 'Brad', 'Douriff', 'better', 'better']",N/A

I mean, really HOT. Flaming hot in fact. That scared the (blank) out of me!Now that I am no longer a wee lad, but am a bit older and wiser, I watched this movie with great interest. One word: ""Huh?"" This is the freakiest movie ever. And I don't mean that in a good way. It is Dumb with a capital D. Brad Dourif is weird, man. It freaks me out to even look at the guy. And the story is really lame. A psychic radio show guy gets set on fire through the phone. Sam's mentor turnes out to be an EVIL MADMAN who is trying to set him up with his sister/girlfriend Lisa so that together they will breed and create the ULTIMATE SECRET GOVERNMENT WEAPON so that this crazy guy can have THE ULTIMATE POWER. Uh, sorry. You kind of lost me back there somewhere...The ending is... uh, funky. Some bad special effects with a memorable last line: ""Lisa, I can take your fire."" Then the movie just ends. What? It just stops. Like, ""Okay that's it. You can all go home now. Sorry for wasting your time.""This movie would have had a great theme song if they had used The Doors' ""Light My Fire"". I can definitely see telling Cynthia Bain to ""Come on baby light my fire."" I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because... well I'm not sure why really.
