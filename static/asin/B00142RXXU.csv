1144914,A1LI2P529P9IRP,B00142RXXU,Artistic Mind,"[2, 7]","While this movie had potential for being interesting, it definitely failed. I don't know what it is about lesbian films, but it always seems like development in romance is not enough. These films seem to always include a bunch of other characters and problems that no one really cares about. Conflicts and characters that have nothing to do with the development of the main characters or the plot.Because of all the extra things going on I never connected to the two main characters. I could tell they they were supposed to be interesting, I could tell that they probably were starting developing, but all the other b/s going on was in the way. At the end of the video I found myself very disappointed.*Problems in Details*(Age 9 Too Young) They have this whole thing about illusions and people not being able to remember things when they're 9. There isn't really a limit on how young you're allowed to be for your memories to be valid. Sure if someone says they remember something at age 2, it's questionable, but still plausible. I have memories that trace back to when I was 2 (that can be backed up by other persons). Other people can remember things back to when they were 5. How is 9 too young to remember? That was just ridiculous.(Misplaced Cop) There's this guy, a police, who has a crush on Jade. For the longest time I didn't even know he was a cop! I didn't know what he or his job was. He shouldn't have been in this movie at all. There was this weird poorly developed love triangle that was starting to form. If the movie was only about him, the tattoo artist, and Jade - then maybe the triangle would have been more interesting and further developed. However, in this situation it just added clutter to the movie's main plot.(Annoying Younger Brother) OKAY this kid definitely looks old enough to take care of himself. He must be at least 10? I'm guessing 13. I don't recall the movie mentioning his age, but this kid acts like he's 3. He's a crybaby, needy, extremely dependent, jealous, spoiled, and irritating. Is he autistic or mentally challenged? Did I miss that part? Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't keep up with the subtitles in the part where maybe they explained that, but he's very VERY annoying. I wanted to beat this kid. He had no place in this movie because he didn't add anything to it.The reason I gave this 1 star instead of 2 is because I did hate this film. A lot of it was simply stupid. I think it frustrated me most because I could see how it COULD be a great movie, and it killed me that they ruined every chance they had at achieving it. Seriously, don't waste your money on this.I know how frustrating it is searching for a decent lesbian film.May I suggest;1. Fingersmith2. The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love3.

But it turns out not like what I hope, so don't get your hope up too high.This movie is very boring, the main producer (which is a lesbian herself, I think) added too much storyline for the movie (from earthquake, an abnormal brother to a web-cam girl involves with polices), which helps to bring down the movie. Sometimes, I just wish the producers had written more about the relationship between the two characters rather than focus on everything else. Also, some of the characters in the movie are very annoying.Overall, it's not really a good movie, but may be quite enjoyable by some people.",2,An okay movie,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,742,"['went', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'movie', 'good', 'usually', 'what', 'good', 'good', 'out', 'not', 'what', 'hope', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hope', 'up', 'too', 'high.This', 'movie', 'very', 'boring', 'main', 'producer', 'lesbian', 'herself', 'think', 'added', 'too', 'much', 'storyline', 'movie', 'earthquake', 'abnormal', 'brother', 'web-cam', 'girl', 'polices', 'bring', 'down', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'wish', 'producers', 'had', 'written', 'more', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'rather', 'focus', 'everything', 'else', 'Also', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'annoying.Overall', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'people']",Spider Lilies
1144916,A10NM4PC3209XU,B00142RXXU,Deevah,"[3, 3]","A story about a deep, enduring love and passion between two females that exists through years of loneliness, tragedy, yearning, sacrifice and separation. There are several messages flowing through the central theme: recognizing something that has been buried and forgotten with just a touch, surviving life's disappointments by receding into a world of fantasy, surrendering dreams and desires in favor of family cohesion, and hiding one's true self behind a masquerade. Although it is subtitled, the dynamics are a universal language. While there is no role-playing in the relationship between the women, the top/bottom undercurrent is unmistakable -- and sexual depravity is the indulgence of men. The major drawback for me was the use of the ""jasmine"" song meant to convey longing: it serves its purpose the first time and makes sense when restated near the end, but the repetition of it otherwise was downright annoying.",3,Worth watching,1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,924,"['story', 'deep', 'enduring', 'love', 'passion', 'two', 'females', 'years', 'loneliness', 'tragedy', 'yearning', 'sacrifice', 'separation', 'are', 'several', 'messages', 'flowing', 'central', 'theme', 'recognizing', 'something', 'been', 'buried', 'forgotten', 'just', 'touch', 'surviving', 'life', 'disappointments', 'receding', 'world', 'fantasy', 'surrendering', 'dreams', 'desires', 'favor', 'family', 'cohesion', 'hiding', 'one', 'true', 'self', 'masquerade', 'subtitled', 'dynamics', 'are', 'universal', 'language', 'role-playing', 'relationship', 'women', 'top/bottom', 'undercurrent', 'unmistakable', 'sexual', 'depravity', 'indulgence', 'men', 'major', 'drawback', 'was', 'use', 'jasmine', 'song', 'meant', 'convey', 'longing', 'purpose', 'first', 'time', 'sense', 'when', 'restated', 'end', 'repetition', 'otherwise', 'was', 'downright', 'annoying']",Spider Lilies

1144919,A2A1HDK1NXG1S2,B00142RXXU,"turtlex ""turtlex""","[3, 9]","I'm a fan of independent cinema. I understand nuance and subtlety. There's a big difference, however, between nuance and lack of clarity. Unfortunately, this film is all about lack of clarity.The story played here involves a tattoo artist, a ""web-girl"", a semi-catatonic brother, a stuttering and pining cop, a possibly senile grandmother and a wanna-be tattoo'd tough guy. Sounds intriguing, doesn't it? Well, it's not. Mostly, this film is disjointed and confusing, at least twice introducing unresolved plot points. The script uses non-linear storytelling and flashbacks to excess. The only problem is, since the plot is played out poorly, it's very difficult to tell exactly where you are in the storyline at times.Our two main characters, Jade the ""web-girl"" (think online sex worker) and Takeko, the tattoo artist, seem vague with their own history, and though Jade is overwhelmed and thrilled to have discovered her first love working in the local tattoo salon, Takeko has other things on her mind and mostly comes off as detatched.While I can appreciate the attempt made here, ultimately the film fails on a very basic storytelling level. You never become attached to, or really care about, the characters.A Technical Note : While the subtitles are easy to read ( a big plus ), they are lacking in the actual translation. For example, ""it is mere a tattoo"". Also, the subtitles have a kind of grammatical error where every word that uses an apostrophe has an extending spacing to it. While this might not seem an issue, when you're reading subtitles, it slows you down significantly as words seem split in unfamiliar places.This US edition is NOT-RATED but had it gone through the MPAA rating criteria, I'd say it's a PG-13 at best ( for one quick shot of a dismembered body part ).I would suggest passing on this film. Rent it if you have interest, but think twice about making it a permanent part of your collection.",2,"Disjointed at Best, Confusing at Worst, Poor Subtitles",1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,1926,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'independent', 'cinema', 'understand', 'nuance', 'subtlety', 'big', 'difference', 'however', 'nuance', 'lack', 'clarity', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'lack', 'clarity.The', 'story', 'played', 'here', 'tattoo', 'artist', 'web-girl', 'semi-catatonic', 'brother', 'stuttering', 'pining', 'cop', 'possibly', 'senile', 'grandmother', 'wanna-be', 'tattoo', ""'d"", 'tough', 'guy', 'intriguing', ""n't"", 'Well', 'not', 'Mostly', 'film', 'disjointed', 'confusing', 'least', 'twice', 'introducing', 'unresolved', 'plot', 'points', 'script', 'non-linear', 'storytelling', 'flashbacks', 'excess', 'only', 'problem', 'plot', 'played', 'out', 'poorly', 'very', 'difficult', 'tell', 'exactly', 'where', 'are', 'storyline', 'times.Our', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Jade', 'web-girl', 'think', 'sex', 'worker', 'Takeko', 'tattoo', 'artist', 'seem', 'vague', 'own', 'history', 'Jade', 'overwhelmed', 'thrilled', 'have', 'discovered', 'first', 'love', 'working', 'local', 'tattoo', 'salon', 'Takeko', 'other', 'things', 'mind', 'mostly', 'off', 'detatched.While', 'can', 'appreciate', 'attempt', 'made', 'here', 'ultimately', 'film', 'very', 'basic', 'storytelling', 'level', 'never', 'become', 'attached', 'really', 'care', 'characters.A', 'Technical', 'Note', 'subtitles', 'are', 'easy', 'read', 'big', 'plus', 'are', 'lacking', 'actual', 'translation', 'example', 'mere', 'tattoo', 'Also', 'subtitles', 'have', 'kind', 'grammatical', 'error', 'where', 'word', 'apostrophe', 'extending', 'spacing', 'might', 'not', 'seem', 'issue', 'when', ""'re"", 'reading', 'subtitles', 'down', 'significantly', 'words', 'seem', 'split', 'unfamiliar', 'places.This', 'US', 'edition', 'NOT-RATED', 'had', 'gone', 'MPAA', 'rating', 'criteria', ""'d"", 'say', 'PG-13', 'best', 'one', 'quick', 'shot', 'dismembered', 'body', 'part', '.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'passing', 'film', 'Rent', 'have', 'interest', 'think', 'twice', 'making', 'permanent', 'part', 'collection']",Spider Lilies
