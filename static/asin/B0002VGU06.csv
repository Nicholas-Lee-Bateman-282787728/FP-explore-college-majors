My husband and I are considering breaking the seals to watch it before then!Fraggle Rock encourages young children to use their imaginations, look at the world around them, and ask questions.  The variety of characters and catchy tunes makes for a show that I have to believe most children will love.  These are timeless in my opinion, but best for children 1-4 and their parents.I will also purchase all of the DVDs that come out, but I think this one, ""Where it all began"" is a logical first step for an entirely new generation of fans that can be engaged in this series thanks to the DVD releases (some of us now refuse to buy videos).  An entire season worth of Fraggle Rock, to a child that's never seen it before, might be kind of overwhelming.  A few episodes at a time is the way most of us learned to love it, and I'll gladly share it with my children the same way!

I bought it (being very skeptical), and fell in love with the show all over again.

847321,A3RYIN4KHLR3Y1,B0002VGU06,Melissa,"[10, 11]","I was so happy to see some Fraggle Rock DVD's start popping out at Amazon. I grew up watching Fraggle Rock when I was younger on HBO and then again on reruns then they seemed to disappear into pop culture history. I even collected and still have all of the books. I just wished I had saved all the McDonald toys as well. This childhood favorite never grows old though it might with today's generation or those who haven't grown up to love and enjoy the works of the amazing, brilliant, and creative mind of Jim Henson.The episodes included are the first episode where Uncle Traveling Matt discovers the human world (Outer Space) and leaves Fraggle Rock. We have a nice introduction to the Fraggle world and even the Gorgs and Marjory The Trash Heap. The second episode Wembley and the Gorgs, Wembley thinks he's a friend of the Gorgs until he realizes that he really belongs with The Fraggles. Let the Water Run is the third episode which features my favorite Fraggle Red.It's really fun to watch extremely old episodes. If you watch carefully you can see the strings holding some of the puppets throughout the episodes. And of course I'm forgetting the loveable Doc and Sprocket the Dog who are the Fraggle's link to Outer Space, plus the very cute Doozers who also live in Fraggle Rock.The only reason's I'm giving it four stars is I understand why a great majority of people today may not get the imagination of puppets and the world of Fraggle Rock. It's extremely old and that's very easy to see; however, that's why I love these DVD's. I love hearing the music and the credits all over again which brings me a lot of fun childhood memories. I would mainly recommend this and Dance Your Cares Away to very young children or fans who remember Fraggle rock!I almost forgot to add there are cute extras throughout these DVD's.

A lot fall quite short of memories and expectations, and, while it's fun and satisfying to see them again, I put them aside and never watch them again.  I'm very happy to say this is not the case here.When my husband and I sat down to watch it, I was excited, him skeptical.  He had barely ever seen any of it before and was expecting a regular puppet show.  By the beginning of the second episode, he was singing along to the theme and wanting more.  He even suggested going out to find the next DVD!  I wasn't disappointed, either.  This is the first show in ages that has lived up to my memories and then some.And the extras.  We now turn on the Musical History extra while doing things like cleaning the house or making dinner so we can sing along.  You can't help but feel good when singing along with most of these songs.  As something of an 80's animation historian/collector, also having the animated episode in the extras is a big plus.  The animated show is actually rather good.  It's not quite as creative or voiced as well as the original show, but it's still darn good for a cartoon and makes a good extra.  There's also a Japanese clay animation short called Pingu.
