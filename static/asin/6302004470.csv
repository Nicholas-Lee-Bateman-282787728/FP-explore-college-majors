I don't know why, best in that short period of time, I saw classics like the Birth Of A Nation, Intolerence, King Of Kings, City Lights, and this gem. Buster Keaton is brilliant. I fell in love with this movie from the get go. Even it was most likey his last great silent movie. So many jokes are still funny today, like the scene when he and big guy try to change into swimming trunks in the same dressing room,when they are at the city pool. Then when Buster comes out, he has on an extra large trunk while the big guy has Busters smaller trunks. I even nearly cried at the end. I can't say much on the story, but its about a lowly tintype photographer who wants a job at MGM to impress lady that he took a picture of. This film is just wonderful and very, very funny. Also, look for Buster's tradmark visual gags.

He plays a tin-type portrait artist who becomes smitten with a girl who works as a secretary at a newsreel company; in order to be by her he buys a movie camera and tries to become a newsreel cameraman. Some of the classic comic secenes (always with Keaton in deadpan mode) include him at a swimming pool, playing baseball with himself in an empty Yankee Stadium, and being in the middle of a Tong war in Chinatown. Perhaps the funniest scene of all is at the end when he unwittingly becomes part of the Lindbergh ticker-tape parade and he thinks the crowd is cheering him. Keaton's balletic humorous touches are on full display, and it's a wonderful comedy.

290335,ACPLJ6XRXIZKD,6302004470,Cheated,"[11, 13]","&quot;The Cameraman&quot; (1928) is one of Keaton's best silent features.  He starts off the movie playing a tintype photographer selling portraits on the streets of NY for 10 cents.  He wants to become a newsreel cameraman  but is burdened only with the tintype camera that is condescendingly  referred to by his jealous rival as a &quot;cocktail shaker&quot; (1920s  silent film &quot;dialogue&quot; seems to veer towards an obsession with  liquor.  Actually, the camera looks more like a chrome spacecraft from an  Ed Wood picture).  Keaton ends up trading in his tintype for an obsolete  newsreel camera that the other news guys make fun of, but seems to work  pretty well throughout the film, and which ends up making him a hero at the  film's ending.Unfortunately for us, the print on this edition is not too  good.  It's very shadowy and has that viewing quality of silent pictures  made in the 1910s.  In other words, it's not very clear.  But the reason is  probably because this film is so good that it was once viewed continuously  at the MGM screening rooms by the rookie gag writers under contract to MGM  and used as a basis of what was regarded as being funny.  There are 2  scenes missing from this picture, probably because of that reason.  One  involves the exit of an admiral from a hotel.  The gag was supposed to  involve Keaton getting this guy mixed up with the hotel's doorman. We are  robbed of this potentially wonderful scene because after it starts, the  film immediately cuts to Keaton displaying samples of his filmwork in the  newsreel office's screening room.  The newsreel samples are a mixture of  double exposures and other convoluted scenes (one of which shows a ship in  the middle of a street - I think it involved the 2nd lost scene) intended  to show us the amateurish quality of his work, but unintentionally look  more like a scary nightmare when combined with the murky quality of this  edition's print.But there are other scenes worth mentioning here, i.e.,  Keaton doing a pantomime of every player in a baseball game (filmed at  Yankee Stadium, and judging by the minute details he gives us of each  player's job, it's obvious Keaton is acting out a real-life labor of love -  for more Keaton baseball, see &quot;One-Run Elmer&quot;), sharing a tiny  bathing suit changing room with another guy (it's not even big enough for  one), and a frightening scene showing him filming a Chinatown Tong war that  gets out of hand.&quot;The Cameraman&quot; is a 5-star picture, but  because this VHS print is kind of worn out, it may be irritating to some  viewers who would not have the patience to just appreciate it for its  artistic quality.  It's a good picture, and it made me weep uncontrollably  (I'm a girl!).",5,One of Keaton's Best Silents,957139200,"05 1, 2000",2000,2753,"['quot', 'Cameraman', 'quot', '1928', 'one', 'Keaton', 'best', 'silent', 'features', 'movie', 'playing', 'tintype', 'photographer', 'selling', 'portraits', 'streets', 'NY', '10', 'cents', 'become', 'newsreel', 'cameraman', 'burdened', 'only', 'tintype', 'camera', 'condescendingly', 'referred', 'jealous', 'rival', 'quot', 'cocktail', 'shaker', 'quot', '1920s', 'silent', 'film', 'quot', 'dialogue', 'quot', 'veer', 'towards', 'obsession', 'liquor', 'Actually', 'camera', 'more', 'chrome', 'spacecraft', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'picture', 'Keaton', 'up', 'trading', 'tintype', 'obsolete', 'newsreel', 'camera', 'other', 'news', 'guys', 'make', 'fun', 'work', 'pretty', 'well', 'film', 'up', 'making', 'hero', 'film', 'ending.Unfortunately', 'print', 'edition', 'not', 'too', 'good', 'very', 'shadowy', 'viewing', 'quality', 'silent', 'pictures', 'made', '1910s', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'reason', 'probably', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'once', 'viewed', 'continuously', 'MGM', 'screening', 'rooms', 'rookie', 'gag', 'writers', 'contract', 'MGM', 'used', 'basis', 'what', 'was', 'regarded', 'being', 'funny', 'are', '2', 'scenes', 'missing', 'picture', 'probably', 'reason', 'One', 'exit', 'admiral', 'hotel', 'gag', 'was', 'supposed', 'involve', 'Keaton', 'getting', 'guy', 'mixed', 'up', 'hotel', 'doorman', 'are', 'robbed', 'potentially', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'film', 'immediately', 'Keaton', 'displaying', 'samples', 'filmwork', 'newsreel', 'office', 'screening', 'room', 'newsreel', 'samples', 'are', 'mixture', 'double', 'exposures', 'other', 'convoluted', 'scenes', 'one', 'ship', 'middle', 'street', 'think', 'involved', '2nd', 'lost', 'scene', 'intended', 'show', 'amateurish', 'quality', 'work', 'unintentionally', 'look', 'more', 'scary', 'nightmare', 'when', 'combined', 'murky', 'quality', 'edition', 'print.But', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'mentioning', 'here', 'i.e.', 'Keaton', 'doing', 'pantomime', 'player', 'baseball', 'game', 'filmed', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'judging', 'minute', 'details', 'player', 'job', 'obvious', 'Keaton', 'acting', 'out', 'real-life', 'labor', 'love', 'more', 'Keaton', 'baseball', 'see', 'quot', 'One-Run', 'Elmer', 'quot', 'sharing', 'tiny', 'bathing', 'suit', 'changing', 'room', 'guy', 'not', 'even', 'big', 'enough', 'one', 'frightening', 'scene', 'showing', 'filming', 'Chinatown', 'Tong', 'war', 'hand.', 'quot', 'Cameraman', 'quot', '5-star', 'picture', 'VHS', 'print', 'kind', 'worn', 'may', 'be', 'irritating', 'viewers', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'patience', 'just', 'appreciate', 'artistic', 'quality', 'good', 'picture', 'made', 'weep', 'uncontrollably', ""'m"", 'girl']",N/A
290336,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6302004470,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","THE CAMERAMAN (writ./dir. Buster Keaton, uncredited, 1928, 69 minutes) A dream come true! Buster's last independent work, on DVD for the world to see. You can also find it here:Buster Keaton Collection (The Cameraman / Spite Marriage / Free & Easy). Your other choice is to get it as a sole title on VHS. A shame, but there you have it, and shame on Amazon for causing confusion as to whether this is an actual DVD version or the VHS.I admit, I can't tell.This is BK's last film with him totally at the helm, and it's his first film under contract with MGM - boy, does MGM play it to the hilt. Poor BK would never be the same, and as such, this film is rarely mentioned with BK's other greats - and is often overlooked. Here he plays a poor street photographer (tintypes) who meets a pretty lady. She inspires him to become a newsreel cameraman, the on-the-spot reporter of the day. You can thank all those cameramen, as this film does, for bringing us newsreels.In an intense, Hitchcockian (well, really it is Keatonian) camera shot, we see the building sign in the MGM lobby, zoomed in so we can see where BK is going to ask for his job. The camera then zooms out quickly to a pan shot of the lobby. Pretty cool, and often copied. BK makes a pest of himself but he gets to capture some newsreel footage as a sort of job application. The use of splitscreen (to show how bad his work is) will stun you in a film this old.BK keeps at it, determined to get his newsreel and become a regular. On his animadventures he acquires an annoying little organ grinder's monkey - but I have to say the monkey does acquit himself well in the end. This particular film is at certain moments annoying and badly paced, not to mention some eyeball-splitting editing errors that Keaton would have never allowed. But he signed on with MGM so he wouldn't have to worry about any of that stuff.Scenes you cannot miss:1 - the staircase routine2 - the spa swimming pool routine in which BK's rear end is clearly seen (not bad!)3 - the Tong War, filmed in a real Chinatown with real Chinese actors4 - the film-within-a-film that saves BK at the endThough I consider this film a step down from BK's greatest work, I will not deduct one star. It is a great, modern film in its own way and a brilliant silent movie even for all that.BK has traded in his signature flattened fedora for a newsboy cap; perhaps that is a sort of omen for the drop in BK's quality films and his loss of autonomy. However, in a couple of scenes he does have a normal black Stetson of the type he modified into his signature hat - you'll readily recognize it - and I will always wonder if that was an unconscious mourning gesture on BK's part.That is why I recommend it and have reviewed it. The film is simply too brilliant and ahead of its time. You must add it to your collection. Then watch it in honor of BK, mourn his artistic loss of freedom and his contract work that eventually ground the life out of him. It's all here.",5,"""What're you doin'?
