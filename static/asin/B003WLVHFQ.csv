1369599,A20IIR0422G3A5,B003WLVHFQ,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 4]","If one were to look for a cinematic approach to theology, this film may be one of the best examples of such a notion, in that it is a good biography of the early and middle portions of the pastoral life of John Wesley and to a lesser extent, his brother, Charles Wesley, the founders of the Methodist movement and denomination, out of their roots in the Church of England. What makes this theological is the importance of learning right living and faith from following the model of great exemplars such as Jesus and Paul. Both of these founders of Christianity preached emulation as the proper model for learning. In that role, the film may be more successful than some of the more flashy Hollywood products such as Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments. The era of the Wesleys is not that far away, and their problems are very, very human. They are the kinds of problems we can run into every day.This film is not a major Hollywood product. It was made on the wrong coast, and not even in or near The Big Apple, the old, original home of the motion picture industry. It was made in North Carolina, by a Moravian, not even by a Methodist. But that is neither here nor there, as the movie achieves its objectives in an informative manner. While this will never be mistaken for an Indiana Jones flick, it succeeds in its own genre as well or better than most other pictures.Aside from the two familiar names in the cast, Kevin McCarthy and June Lockhart, and the actor in the title role, Burgess Jenkins, it seems as if the film was made by independants, for whom film making is not their ""day job"". I know, for example, that the co-writer and director, John Jackman, is a pastor at a North Carolina Moravian church who has produced one or two other films. In spite of that, there is less that is amateur or obviously artificial than you may find in a Hollywood exploitation film.Be aware that the film is not pure history. In a question and answer session after a screening of the film in Bethlehem, PA (Moravian Central) Jackman explained that several scenes were a composite of a series of meetings or events. But several of the more important events in the development of Wesley's beliefs are historically genuine, such as Wesley's being influenced by Moravians and by one of his more important epiphanies being prompted by his listening to a reading of an English translation of Martin Luther's commentary on the book of Romans. In response to a comment by another reviewer, Jackman also assured us that the costuming and locations for the film are quite accurate.For a film on a religious topic, by professional church folks, I confess the film is not as preachy as one may have expected. This is about real people and real situations, and how real people have their faith developed by life experiences and how great ideas can arise from seemingly incidental occurrences.This is a great film to show in a church. Unlike many such films, it can appeal to people of many different ages. To exhibit the film to a group such as a church, you need a license. Search the Internet for Wesley The Movie. The licenses are remarkably inexpensive if you add up admission per person charges in a commercial theatre.It ain't Avatar, but then, Avatar isn't good ecclesiastical history.

1369604,A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE,B003WLVHFQ,G. Max Gooding,"[11, 11]","Background:John Wesley (28 June 1703 - 2 March 1791) was an amazing evangelist. He was a brilliant theologian; however, his head knowledge and good works alone could not provide him with the peace and blessed assurance that a soul has when it is assured of its salvation.Eventually he has his encounter with the Holy Spirit and he is never the same, and his whole method of preaching changes which results in the formation of the Methodist Society.Film Production:This film is based on the personal journals of Mr John Wesley. It starts in 1709 at Epworth, England. There is a fire at his home, and he is rescued at the age of 5. This fire leaves a lasting impression on John Wesley - The film fast forwards and then shows John Wesley as a young man waking up from a nightmare of the fire. Other flashbacks of the fire are placed throughout the movie. Additionally, as his fame spreads abroad, he shows a strong reluctance to return to Epworth. However, he eventually overcomes this fear and returns.Fear of Death and Hell:John Wesley comes to the realization that his faith has something lacking, this was based on the calmness of the Moravians who were traveling along with him in a ship that was being heavily battered by a storm. This caused John Wesley to seek the missing part of his salvation even further.Overall Story:The life of John Wesley seems to be accurately portrayed in this film. The locations, incidents and events are well depicted. However, the later years of Wesley are not contained in this DVD.Conclusion:In my opinion, the message of John Wesley is that everyone needs to experience Jesus Christ personally. This is an excellent addition to any DVD collection, where there is an interest in the protestant reformation and the growth of the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ.",5,Man with a Method,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,1797,"['Background', 'John', 'Wesley', '28', 'June', '1703', '2', 'March', '1791', 'was', 'amazing', 'evangelist', 'was', 'brilliant', 'theologian', 'however', 'head', 'knowledge', 'good', 'works', 'alone', 'could', 'not', 'provide', 'peace', 'blessed', 'assurance', 'soul', 'when', 'assured', 'salvation.Eventually', 'encounter', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'never', 'same', 'whole', 'method', 'preaching', 'changes', 'results', 'formation', 'Methodist', 'Society.Film', 'Production', 'film', 'based', 'personal', 'journals', 'Mr', 'John', 'Wesley', '1709', 'Epworth', 'England', 'fire', 'home', 'rescued', 'age', '5', 'fire', 'lasting', 'impression', 'John', 'Wesley', 'film', 'fast', 'forwards', 'then', 'John', 'Wesley', 'young', 'man', 'waking', 'up', 'nightmare', 'fire', 'Other', 'flashbacks', 'fire', 'are', 'placed', 'movie', 'Additionally', 'fame', 'abroad', 'strong', 'reluctance', 'return', 'Epworth', 'However', 'eventually', 'fear', 'returns.Fear', 'Death', 'Hell', 'John', 'Wesley', 'realization', 'faith', 'something', 'lacking', 'was', 'based', 'calmness', 'Moravians', 'who', 'were', 'traveling', 'along', 'ship', 'was', 'being', 'heavily', 'battered', 'storm', 'caused', 'John', 'Wesley', 'seek', 'missing', 'part', 'salvation', 'even', 'further.Overall', 'Story', 'life', 'John', 'Wesley', 'be', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'film', 'locations', 'incidents', 'events', 'are', 'well', 'depicted', 'However', 'later', 'years', 'Wesley', 'are', 'not', 'contained', 'DVD.Conclusion', 'opinion', 'message', 'John', 'Wesley', 'everyone', 'experience', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'personally', 'excellent', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'where', 'interest', 'protestant', 'reformation', 'growth', 'Church', 'Lord', 'Jesus', 'Christ']",N/A

The movie was more of the story of Wesley's conversion to true faith in Christ, rather than a portrayal of his life and ministry (though such was lightly touched on following the probably less impactful shamed experience of John and Charles in Georgia, which seemed to be the greater part of focus in the film).  As many Christian films the majority of the acting and the special effects were unimpressive.  George Whitefield was a necesarry side-character, with whom I was unimpressed in the film, I was hoping they'd do a better job portraying him, as he was a powerful revivalist in English history and intregal in the assistance of the Methodist movement (specifically by aiding John and Charles in expanding their evangelistic view).

Several aspects of the film's quality leaped out at me.  First, it is beautifully filmed.  Second, the acting by all of the primaries is wonderful.  Finally, as a bit of a Methodist historian myself (see my book ""the Fruit of the Vine, a history of Methodism in the Southern Piedmont"" on Amazon), I was very impressed with the historical accuracy of the film.  Most Methodists and Moravians known little of Wesley's years in Georgia and the fact that they were, with the exception of his organizing a small ""Methodist"" meeting there, a complete failure.The movie admirably portrays Wesley's awkwardness with women - a problem that plagued him throughout his life, as his later marriage was an utter disaster with a great deal of bitterness arising between him and his bride.  The movie also recreates the very real desire in Wesley's life to seek a right relationship with God and to be the servant he felt he was called to be.  The tensions this quest caused him, both personally and professionally, are briefly summarized in the final part of the version I saw and were interesting to see.Ultimately, I saw this movie and found myself more hopeful about not only my own Methodist faith (as the movie does not mince words on the call of the Gospel) and Christian film making.  I have since seen the film Billy, the Early Years and was equally pleased with the quality of its production.I am hopeful, because it has generally been my experience that most Christian films have sucked over the years.  I say this despite my being a Methodist pastor, but ultimately because I love movies and have been reluctant and always disappointed in the quality of Christian movies over the years.

People who know little but the name should carry away a vivid and sound impression; those who know more will appreciate the perspective that a good movie offers.The movie is a resounding success, if we take into account the scope of the film and the limitations of a modest budget.  It has clarity, good storytelling, satisfying visuals, and music to match.  Among the inevitable weaknesses is the problem of accent, which another review rightly calls &#34;uneven.&#34;The copy we received is widescreen and fits our 16:9 (1.78) screen nicely.  It has subtitles, which are very important for old folks like us.  My wife called it &#34;wonderful&#34; and wanted to make sure we had our own copy.",4,Refreshing and well done,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,780,"['34', 'Wesley', '34', 'fine', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'critical', 'years', 'life', 'People', 'who', 'know', 'little', 'name', 'should', 'carry', 'away', 'vivid', 'sound', 'impression', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'will', 'appreciate', 'perspective', 'good', 'movie', 'offers.The', 'movie', 'resounding', 'success', 'take', 'account', 'scope', 'film', 'limitations', 'modest', 'budget', 'clarity', 'good', 'storytelling', 'satisfying', 'visuals', 'music', 'match', 'inevitable', 'weaknesses', 'problem', 'accent', 'review', 'rightly', '34', 'uneven.', '34', 'copy', 'received', 'widescreen', '16:9', '1.78', 'screen', 'nicely', 'subtitles', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'old', 'folks', 'wife', 'called', '34', 'wonderful', '34', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'had', 'own', 'copy']",N/A
