The use of multiple authors and the titles of their related books would be a great place for the newly interested to start a reading list. The graphic video of the 12 year old girl getting liposuction should make an impact on people who may be innured to the standard screenshots of overweight people wattling around unidentified cities. The documentary also does a good job of touching on the multiple factors wrapped up in the debate about obesity/diabetes and clearly demonstrates why the answer is far less simple than it appears at a glance. That said, it wasn't well edited and is very much an introduction documentary rather than a serious investigation or source of really informative material.

The interesting thing is that the film shows that the fault is it is part nurture (Brooke eats obsessively to combat psycho-emotional problems) and part nature (her parents are not obese and the fat goes to parts of her body unaffected by the surgery).

1220192,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001NLAVL8,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[65, 69]","Killer At Large is a very good documentary that explores the obesity epidemic and the major causes of obesity along with the politics, social issues and even the health problems caused by obesity. The film progresses at a very good pace and I was never bored; the people interviewed gave insightful comments that were very relevant and we get both sides of the story although admittedly the film focuses on the people who support the viewpoints of the filmmakers. The quality of the print is very good, too.We see practically everything on this topic; this film is well done indeed. For example, the footage of former US Surgeon General Richard Carmona shows him telling audiences that ""obesity is the terror within; and unless we do something about it, the magnitude of the dilemma will dwarf 9/11 or any other terrorist event you can point out to me."" Wow, what a statement! But the facts are there to support his claims: we are inundated with medical statistics and testimony from people from all walks of life that obesity is a fantastically serious problem that merits our immediate attention. Indeed, the film begins with us meeting a twelve year old girl, Brooke Bates, who has not been able to control her weight. Her parents willingly sign her up for liposuction despite her tender age! Yes, the liposuction procedure and an additional tummy tuck work wonders for her while she exercises--until, that is, she regains the weight that she lost; and by the end of the film we learn that she's going with her parents for an even more invasive procedure even though she's still only thirteen!And it isn't just Brooke Bates. Bill Clinton goes on record as saying that obesity is a killer; and he's right. We get great comments from Dr. Linda Kinsinger who is the Director of The VA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention that ""71% of our veterans are overweight or obese;"" and people like Ralph Nader and Neil LaBute (film director and author of the book entitled ""Fat Pig"") all share their stories about the horrors of people practically eating their way into the grave. Meme Roth of National Action Against Obesity also has plenty to say on this topic and the issues surrounding it.But there's so much more in this film. The film show how junk food companies kiss up to members of Congress and others to get their vending machines distributed practically everywhere we look; this means that we can't go too far without seeing a cue that we should be eating or drinking some very calorie-rich food. Companies like Frito Lay and McDonalds can buy their ways into everyone's home; their commercials are designed to look like regular Saturday morning cartoons and this takes advantage of the fact that very young kids under the age of eight typically cannot distinguish between commercials and regular television programming. The commercials lead young kids to believe that if they eat at McDonalds everything they will live happily ever after! In addition, I love the part in the film when one mother complains to a panel of representatives from fast food companies that their commercials are undermining her ability to teach her children to eat healthy food and to stay away from junk food. We also get comments by a school lunch worker who says that the quality of lunches is so poor because of the way the federal government reimburses schools for their lunch programs--the school must give a certain minimum of calories to each student; and if they gave a healthy lunch they wouldn't meet the calorie minimum requirement and thus they would lose their lunch program funding!There's actually much more in this film so if you think I've given it all away and spoiled it for you I can happily assure you that this is not the case. The DVD also comes with extras; I liked the deleted scenes in particular. There is even an abridged version for educational purposes in the classroom; but hopefully teachers can show the complete version to school kids as soon as they're able to follow along.The only thing I didn't care for is that the film doesn't focus enough on the incredible self-discipline that it really, really takes to lose weight. In many cases (but certainly not all) there simply isn't any excuse or alternative for losing weight--you need to exercise more and eat smaller amounts of food that is very healthy for you. In the past whenever I have been overweight, as I am now, this has been the only method I ever tried that worked for me when I wanted to become thinner. In addition, they show George W. Bush encouraging exercise but they do it in a way that seems to mock him and belittle his sincerity. While I was not sorry to see Mr. Bush leave office several months ago, I don't see why they should mock him for encouraging people to exercise. Otherwise this is a very good film.Killer at Large does a fine job of exploring the serious epidemic of obesity and the terrible health problems that result from many, many people being way too overweight. I recommend this film for people studying the obesity epidemic; this film should be mandatory viewing for school kids once they are old enough to learn from it. Moreover, people who are overweight like me should watch this film and perhaps gain enough strength from it to be brave and do something constructive about losing weight.",4,"a scary, informative look

1220193,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B001NLAVL8,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[2, 3]","""Killer at Large"" is the scariest documentary I've ever had the pleasure to view. Knowing that obesity is a killer is frightening enough but knowing you could also lose an arm or leg if you keep eating wrong and get diabetes is even more troubling. This movie shows how we are drinking sugar and eating highly processed foods that have very little nutritional value. Having vending machines in schools is one of the big problems discussed.So what has caused the obesity epidemic? Is the solution really as simple as eating less and exercising more? Well not really. The real problem is that we are all stressed out either by living in a dysfunctional family or working for companies that are stressful by nature. From what the people promoting this film say, stress causes us to eat more and not burn fat that is in storage. Also listening to stressful news causes us to become fearful of life itself. So in the back of our minds we are constantly on edge, expecting the next disaster to hit.What does disturb me a bit is how people try to always blame the government for our mistakes and for our wrong food choices. I read plenty of helpful health books that have taught me many good ways to eat. I don't rely on what the government tells me to eat.One thing that this movie did promote was healthy exercise. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush talked about healthier ways to live with Bush demonstrating bike riding and running as good options. He felt that we all make priorities and should keep exercise near the top of our priority list.As far as advertisements aimed at babies and small children - these things can be controlled by parents who simply don't leave their child stuck in front of a TV all day long. But beyond say age 8 children should be being taught good food choices. Parents have the control over what kids eat at this point although more TV commercials will try to influence behavior and will make children nag for what they want. So there is a battle between healthy choices and junk food choices. Hopefully a parent can explain why certain food choices are better. Already there are plenty of books that teach parents to put vegetables in regular foods.It was a pleasure to see the school in this movie where kids are being fed an all organic whole food diet. This gave me hope to know there are things that can be done almost immediately.Really, parents and children have to gain an understanding of what to eat and what not to eat. Some foods we may turn our noses up at may eventually be worked into the diet. Like kale salad is pretty good and you can even buy it in premade bags at your local grocery store. So exploring how we can eat more fruits and vegetables might help us to lose weight. Like apples are good with peanut butter and that can be a good snack. You can also make bean dips to eat with organic chips. Instead of always going for the premade junk food there are many great options.So this DVD will give you an overview and then you have to do the research yourself.

Is it significant that the Centers for Disease Control are predicting that one of three children born today will come down with Type 2 diabetes, or that the average life span of our children will actually go down compared to their parents?Does it bother you that billions of dollars are being made by corporations devoted to getting your children (and you) to eat high calorie, low nutrient density foods, and that your government seems happy to tell you, ""No worries... just exercise it off.""If you answer ""yes"" to these questions, then you'll probably find Killer at Large both interesting and disturbing.  There is an obesity CRISIS.  The cause is multifaceted, but there can be no doubt that our diet plays an obvious and significant part.Calories in, calories out.  And this dynamic interplay is affected by food availability, exercise, stress, genetics, motivation, and many other factors.  But never, never weigh (pun intended) any factor more than that initial issue of what (and how often) you put the wrong items into your mouth.Killer at Large is a documentary.  You'll get a disturbing glimpse of 12 year old,  210+ pound Brooke Bates undergoing liposuction and regaining her weight mere months later.  George W Bush tells ""us"" repeatedly that the problem is that we need to get off the couch and exercise.  Those companies producing Twinkies and sodas are not to blame.  And his Secretary of HSS, Mike Leavitt?  I was left feeling embarrassed for my nation, that our official answer to the obesity crisis was public service announcements featuring the imaginary character Shrek imploring kids to play for an hour a day outside.  This is the same Shrek that the marketing gurus use to actually SELL obesity-inducing foods to kids!There are some heros featured in this documentary.  Bill Clinton tells of his struggles with weight.  Arnold Schwarzenegger initiates a ban on junk food in California's schools.  Michael Pollan discusses our corn-based food system.  Senator Tom Harkin slays misleading and harmful advertising.  And many nutrition policy reform advocates get a chance to point their fingers.  Calories in, calories out.I would have left out the sections on faith gurus having a say, and I didn't understand the initial emphasis on stress as a root cause of obesity (this didn't really appear later on in the film).Former Surgeon General Richard Carmona stated ""Obesity is a terror within. It is destroying our society... .""Killer at Large is meant to get you interested in the issue.  There are other books and movies that will give you a better insight into solutions.  Killer at Large is a call to arms, to combat the terror within ourselves and in society, a health crisis that IS killing more people than any outside terrorist activities.SO... As Michael Pollan states in one of his books,  ""Eat food.  Not too much.  Mostly plants.""  Add to this the resolve to move your body.  Walk 10,000 steps a day, and measure this with a quality pedometer.  Finally, take control by turning off television commercials, most of which focus on getting you to eat unhealthy foods.Take control, and battle the Killer at Large.",4,"Forgive them, for they know not what they do...",1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,3171,"['Does', 'quality', 'life', 'matter', 'significant', 'Centers', 'Disease', 'Control', 'are', 'predicting', 'one', 'three', 'children', 'born', 'today', 'will', 'come', 'down', 'Type', '2', 'diabetes', 'average', 'life', 'span', 'children', 'will', 'actually', 'go', 'down', 'compared', 'parents', 'bother', 'billions', 'dollars', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'corporations', 'devoted', 'getting', 'children', 'eat', 'high', 'calorie', 'low', 'nutrient', 'density', 'foods', 'government', 'happy', 'tell', 'No', 'worries', 'just', 'exercise', 'off', 'answer', 'yes', 'questions', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'Killer', 'Large', 'interesting', 'disturbing', 'obesity', 'CRISIS', 'cause', 'multifaceted', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', 'diet', 'obvious', 'significant', 'part.Calories', 'calories', 'out', 'dynamic', 'interplay', 'affected', 'food', 'availability', 'exercise', 'stress', 'genetics', 'motivation', 'many', 'other', 'factors', 'never', 'never', 'weigh', 'pun', 'intended', 'factor', 'more', 'initial', 'issue', 'what', 'how', 'often', 'put', 'wrong', 'items', 'mouth.Killer', 'Large', 'documentary', ""'ll"", 'get', 'disturbing', 'glimpse', '12', 'year', 'old', '210+', 'pound', 'Brooke', 'Bates', 'undergoing', 'liposuction', 'regaining', 'weight', 'mere', 'months', 'later', 'George', 'W', 'Bush', 'repeatedly', 'problem', 'need', 'get', 'off', 'couch', 'exercise', 'companies', 'producing', 'Twinkies', 'sodas', 'are', 'not', 'blame', 'Secretary', 'HSS', 'Mike', 'Leavitt', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'embarrassed', 'nation', 'official', 'answer', 'obesity', 'crisis', 'was', 'public', 'service', 'announcements', 'featuring', 'imaginary', 'character', 'Shrek', 'imploring', 'kids', 'play', 'hour', 'day', 'same', 'Shrek', 'marketing', 'gurus', 'use', 'actually', 'SELL', 'obesity-inducing', 'foods', 'kids', 'are', 'heros', 'featured', 'documentary', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'tells', 'struggles', 'weight', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'ban', 'junk', 'food', 'California', 'schools', 'Michael', 'Pollan', 'corn-based', 'food', 'system', 'Senator', 'Tom', 'Harkin', 'misleading', 'harmful', 'advertising', 'many', 'nutrition', 'policy', 'reform', 'get', 'chance', 'point', 'fingers', 'Calories', 'calories', 'out.I', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'sections', 'faith', 'gurus', 'having', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'initial', 'emphasis', 'stress', 'root', 'cause', 'obesity', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'appear', 'later', 'film', '.Former', 'Surgeon', 'General', 'Richard', 'Carmona', 'stated', 'Obesity', 'terror', 'destroying', 'society', 'Killer', 'Large', 'meant', 'get', 'interested', 'issue', 'are', 'other', 'books', 'movies', 'will', 'give', 'better', 'insight', 'solutions', 'Killer', 'Large', 'call', 'arms', 'combat', 'terror', 'ourselves', 'society', 'health', 'crisis', 'killing', 'more', 'people', 'outside', 'terrorist', 'activities.SO', 'Michael', 'Pollan', 'one', 'books', 'Eat', 'food', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'Mostly', 'plants', 'resolve', 'move', 'body', 'Walk', '10,000', 'steps', 'day', 'measure', 'quality', 'pedometer', 'Finally', 'take', 'control', 'turning', 'off', 'television', 'commercials', 'most', 'focus', 'getting', 'eat', 'unhealthy', 'foods.Take', 'control', 'battle', 'Killer', 'Large']",Killer at Large
1220195,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B001NLAVL8,stoic,"[3, 4]","Killer at Large is an insightful, thorough look at America's obesity crisis. Viewers who watch this film will come away with a good understanding of the depth of this problem. The film also does a good job of explaining the corporate and political interests that oppose efforts to change the way we eat.Killer at Large is at its best when it discusses the impact of obesity on America's children. The film details the appalling steps taken by corporate America to sell kids junk food; the film also explains the rapidly kids' declining health. Killer at Large shows Brooke Bates, a 218-pound 12-year-old undergoing liposuction in an effort to slim down - and gain acceptance from her peers at school. Bates' story tugs at the viewer's heartstrings.The film also explains some of the efforts to fight obesity. The viewer hears about the effort to ban snack foods in schools. (Amazingly, when California institutes such a ban, there is massive resistance both from students and their parents). We also hear of a Massachusetts town that has implemented plans to improve public health by encouraging exercise and by imploring its restaurants to serve healthier food. The overall tone of Killer at Large, however, is despairing.If I had to be critical of Killer at Large I would say that the filmmakers' thinking is questionable at times. Killer at Large contains snickers at the Bush administration's promotion of exercise and personal responsibility and its use of public service announcements as means of fighting obesity (as opposed to asking Americans to change their diets). That the filmmakers rely on criticisms from Stephen Colbert, Bill Maher, and Ralph Nader provides some clue as to the politics of Killer at Large.For what it's worth, I think that Bush did a poor job of responding to the obesity crisis and that the filmmakers are correct in stating that we must change our diets. I also think, however, that the filmmakers' politics cause them to dismiss without apparent reflection the potential good that can come from some of the current anti-obesity programs. After the Surgeon General's 1964 statement on the ills of smoking, it took multiple programs administered over decades for many Americans to stop using tobacco; sadly, I suspect that it may take at least that long for many of us to adopt healthier diets.Despite my quibbles, I highly recommend Killer at Large.
