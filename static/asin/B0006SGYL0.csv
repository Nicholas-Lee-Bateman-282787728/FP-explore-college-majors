872478,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0006SGYL0,,"[5, 6]","The Grudge (Takashi Shimizu, 2004)Among die-hard film snobs (like yours truly), the name of Korean producer Roy Lee has become the most loathed in Hollywood virtually overnight. Lee's tremendous success with the remake of The Ring led him to embrace the ""if it ain't broke, fix it anyway"" philosophy wholeheartedly. A check on his IMDB page shows no fewer than seventeen projects either completed or in production, the majority of them being American remakes of Japanese films (mostly horror, but Hideo Nakata's brilliant mystery Chaos is represented as well). But the bottom line is that if all of Lee's upcoming projects are as well-done as The Ring and The Grudge, folks have nothing at all to worry about.Takashi Shimizu directs the remake of his own Ju-On, translated by Stephen Susco (whose next project is Lucky McKee's adaptation of Jack Ketchum's novel Red, another ""can't-wait-to-see-this"" movie), and for all intents and purposes, all that was done was replace some of the main actors with Americans. Some of the actors from the original film also reprise their roles here (most notably Takako Fuji as Kayako), while other, better-known Japanese actors dropped into some roles for the remake (most notably Ryo Ishibashi, who gained recognition on this side of the pond as the lead in Takashi Miike's Audition). What you end up with is an above-average cast featuring some actors who really don't get enough exposure in American cinema (Grace Zabriskie, whose role here is understated and chilling in the extreme, for example).Because the original director reprised his role this time, The Grudge bears far more of a resemblance to the original than did The Ring. Still, it bears looking at as its own movie, rather than as a remake, and it is quite a lovely thing to behold-- the horror of the film comes not so much from the events as from the incredible attention to detail and the overall atmosphere of the thing. Definitely worth your time. ****",4,"Beautiful, atmospheric, creepy.",1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,1960,"['Grudge', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', '2004', 'die-hard', 'film', 'snobs', 'yours', 'truly', 'name', 'Korean', 'producer', 'Roy', 'Lee', 'become', 'most', 'loathed', 'Hollywood', 'virtually', 'overnight', 'Lee', 'tremendous', 'success', 'remake', 'Ring', 'led', 'embrace', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'fix', 'anyway', 'philosophy', 'wholeheartedly', 'check', 'IMDB', 'page', 'fewer', 'seventeen', 'projects', 'either', 'completed', 'production', 'majority', 'being', 'American', 'remakes', 'Japanese', 'films', 'mostly', 'horror', 'Hideo', 'Nakata', 'brilliant', 'mystery', 'Chaos', 'represented', 'well', 'bottom', 'line', 'Lee', 'upcoming', 'projects', 'are', 'as', 'well-done', 'Ring', 'Grudge', 'folks', 'have', 'nothing', 'worry', 'about.Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'remake', 'own', 'Ju-On', 'translated', 'Stephen', 'Susco', 'next', 'project', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'adaptation', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'novel', 'Red', ""can't-wait-to-see-this"", 'movie', 'intents', 'purposes', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'replace', 'main', 'actors', 'Americans', 'actors', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'reprise', 'roles', 'here', 'most', 'notably', 'Takako', 'Fuji', 'Kayako', 'other', 'better-known', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'dropped', 'roles', 'remake', 'most', 'notably', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'who', 'gained', 'recognition', 'side', 'pond', 'lead', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'Audition', 'What', 'end', 'up', 'above-average', 'cast', 'featuring', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'exposure', 'American', 'cinema', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie', 'role', 'here', 'understated', 'chilling', 'extreme', 'example', 'original', 'director', 'reprised', 'role', 'time', 'Grudge', 'far', 'more', 'resemblance', 'original', 'did', 'Ring', 'Still', 'looking', 'own', 'movie', 'rather', 'remake', 'quite', 'lovely', 'thing', 'behold', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'events', 'incredible', 'attention', 'detail', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'thing', 'Definitely', 'time', '****']",N/A
872479,AFOP4Q3JUKV7L,B0006SGYL0,"A. Abbott ""Madam Music""","[2, 2]","No wonder the ghost in this movie is groaning all the time; I'd hate to be remembered like that, too. I liked the Grudge; I thought it was good and scary and it made sense (as much as a ghost movie about a curse can, anyway). The Grudge 2 had scary parts (I did scream twice) but that's just it; parts. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so forgive me if this review is a bit choppy.The Grudge 2 has a lot of flashbacks/flash forwards with three different groups of characters in three different locations. The only character that really belonged was Aubrey, Karen's (from the first movie; the heroine) sister. Otherwise, it was two other relatively random groups of people and Aubrey ended up being alright, but not the most interesting. If the movie focused on one group of characters and really developed that, it might of done better.The beginning was pretty good but I think it went downhill and became just predictable blah. There were horror parts that I ended up laughing because  the timing was just off or the feeling was wrong; and it seemed really B-movie. There were character actions/developments that just didn't make sense, either. At the end, things were kinda-sorta tied together but it was far from smooth and complete.Some people (my brother and sister-in-law) were frightened out of their minds while watching this movie; so maybe you might enjoy it more than I did. However, my mother and I didn't think it was that good. It was okay.Mother's Reaction: That was just weird.My Reaction: That was just disappointing.I'm glad I rented it because I did get to see a movie with scary scenes; and I ate junk food with my family. However, if your at the movie rental store and your torn between The Grudge 2 and something else; pick the other movie if you want a chance at something great (but beware of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"", the guy at the rental place said that was a dumb movie).Neh, this was a three star (okay) movie.",3,No Wonder the Ghost Groans,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,1966,"['wonder', 'ghost', 'movie', 'groaning', 'time', ""'d"", 'hate', 'be', 'remembered', 'too', 'liked', 'Grudge', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'scary', 'made', 'sense', 'as', 'much', 'ghost', 'movie', 'curse', 'can', 'anyway', 'Grudge', '2', 'had', 'scary', 'parts', 'did', 'scream', 'twice', 'just', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'so', 'forgive', 'review', 'bit', 'choppy.The', 'Grudge', '2', 'lot', 'flashbacks/flash', 'forwards', 'three', 'different', 'groups', 'characters', 'three', 'different', 'locations', 'only', 'character', 'really', 'belonged', 'was', 'Aubrey', 'Karen', 'first', 'movie', 'heroine', 'sister', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'two', 'other', 'relatively', 'random', 'groups', 'people', 'Aubrey', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'alright', 'not', 'most', 'interesting', 'movie', 'focused', 'one', 'group', 'characters', 'really', 'developed', 'might', 'done', 'better.The', 'beginning', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'went', 'downhill', 'became', 'just', 'predictable', 'blah', 'were', 'horror', 'parts', 'ended', 'up', 'laughing', 'timing', 'was', 'just', 'off', 'feeling', 'was', 'wrong', 'seemed', 'really', 'B-movie', 'were', 'character', 'actions/developments', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'either', 'end', 'things', 'were', 'kinda-sorta', 'tied', 'together', 'was', 'far', 'smooth', 'complete.Some', 'people', 'brother', 'sister-in-law', 'were', 'frightened', 'minds', 'watching', 'movie', 'maybe', 'might', 'enjoy', 'more', 'did', 'However', 'mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'Reaction', 'was', 'just', 'weird.My', 'Reaction', 'was', 'just', 'disappointing.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'rented', 'did', 'get', 'see', 'movie', 'scary', 'scenes', 'ate', 'junk', 'food', 'family', 'However', 'movie', 'rental', 'store', 'torn', 'Grudge', '2', 'something', 'else', 'pick', 'other', 'movie', 'want', 'chance', 'something', 'great', 'beware', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Beginning', 'guy', 'rental', 'place', 'said', 'was', 'dumb', 'movie', '.Neh', 'was', 'three', 'star', 'movie']",N/A

872481,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B0006SGYL0,Ace-of-Stars,"[7, 8]","After seeing the horrible ""reworking"" done on Nakata Hideo's scare-fest ""RING"" by director Gore Verbinski and DreamWorks-- and seeing how director Walter Salles intends to 'one-up' Verbinski with his complete mangling of another Nakata masterpiece, ""HONOGURAI MIZU NO SOKO KARA"" (currently in production as ""DARK WATER"" with Disney/Touchstone as joint culprit) --I had some hesitation about wanting to see the Hollywood remake of ""JUON."" But four specific things fueled my interest in this Occidental revision entitled ""The Grudge"":(1) It would keep the story set in Japan, using many of the same sets and actors of the original series;(2) Sam Raimi (""The Evil Dead"") not only put up the money to have this movie remade, but he was so appreciative of the original Japanese theatrical production (and so confident of the success of the remake) that he was instrumental in getting ""JUON"" a wide US distribution even before the remake was completed and released to theatres;(3) Raimi insisted that Shimizu Takashi, the director of the original productions, be retained as the director of the US remake as well;(4) The pre-release trailers of the film made it unambiguously obvious that, unlike the distorted crud given to us by the teams of DreamWorks/Verbinski & Disney/Salles, ""The Grudge"" was going to be a true ""remake"" that remained VERY faithful to the original material.Of course, none of that could guarantee that I'd be 100% satisfied with the result because, sadly, I wasn't. But that doesn't mean it was a bad movie or a failed experiment -- there is still much to like about this movie even for hardened ""Juon Junkies"" like myself. It's just that this film, as faithful a remake as it was, just didn't have the right kind of ""texture"": Gone was the gloominess & ambiance of the original productions, gone was the slow-paced and the tension build-up, gone was the ""REAL"" reason Saeki Takeo murdered his family (but, of course, reusing the original Japanese cast as the Saeki family, that really could not have been helped short of casting Jason Scott Lee or Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa in the ""Kobayashi-sensei/Peter"" role), and gone was the ""REAL"" reason Kayako makes that unsettling croaking noise (and it's not the reason they try to make you believe it is in the remake). There was never a moment in the film where I was not aware that I was watching a ""Hollywood"" production -- all of the ""Asian qualities"" I liked so much about the original series just weren't in this movie, and it's not because of the presence of Caucasian actors and English dialogue. My difficulty in relating to this remake stems from the fact that the presentation was too bright, too loud, too fast, too sanitized, too refined, too perfect -- lacking all the ""rawness"" and the pure emotion of the original series.For those not all that familiar with what I'm talking about, ""The Grudge"" is based on a series of movies called ""JUON"" or ""JU-ON"" (literal translation: ""curse grudge""). It began as a two-part 'V-Cinema' (Japan's version of 'made-for-television/video') series called, appropriately, ""JUON"" and ""JUON 2"" -- which were marketed (but not ""officially"" titled) with the English companion title, ""THE CURSE."" Because of the immediate success of these two V-Cinema productions, writer/director Shimizu Takashi was given a bigger budget to work with along with a green light to begin work on a theatrical version, that was released under the name, ""JUON"" -- which, after a successful run in theatres throughout Asia, was followed by a theatrical sequel called, you guessed it, ""JUON 2."" In order to alleviate some of the confusion that was certain to arise, ""JUON"" and ""JUON 2,"" the theatrical versions, were distinguished from their V-Cinema counterparts by being given the marketed (yet still ""unofficial"") English title, ""THE GRUDGE.""Contrary to popular misinformation spreading about, ""Juon"" (theatrical) is not a remake of ""Juon"" (v-cinema), but is, along with the theatrical sequel, a ""continuation"" of the same story; much like ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" is a 'continuation' of the original Star Trek television series' ""Space Seed"" episode. So, in actuality, the theatrical release of ""Juon"" and its sequel are best described as ""Juon, part 3"" and ""Juon, part 4"" respectively.Because most of the people who learn of the original story generally become familiarized only with the first theatrical production (""Part 3""), they naturally assume that ""The Grudge"" is a remake of that film, when in reality the Western remake incorporates important story elements from both the first 'theatrical' production (""Part 3"") and the first 'video' production (""Part 1""), thereby providing much of the ""back story"" one would normally not have if they were only familiar with the theatrical releases of the original story. So, in this sense, ""The Grudge"" provides some important (but really not all that necessary) background details for those who have seen ""Juon"" (the movie) but were unable to gain access to the original V-Cinema productions.Anyway, as the opening screen text explains (in all five films), ""Juon"" refers to [paraphrasing] a curse that is born when someone dies violently in the grip of a powerful rage where there is great resentment, etc., etc. Because of having died such an undignified death, the resentment (or 'grudge') lingers & festers in the place(s) where the horrific murders occurred, which then indiscriminately lashes out at ANYONE (male, female, adult, child, rich, poor, married, single, Asian, Caucasian, Terran, Martian, whatever) who trespasses upon the cursed site -- in this case, the central location where the curse resides & emanates from is a typical Japanese ""middle-class"" house (in the V-Cinema, it is the same house plus another apartment in a different part of town). The curse does not always manifest itself right away; in fact, it might take years before the cursed spirits enact their rage against their victims -- and the victims are not always dispatched the same way: some get strangled, some get literally ripped to pieces, others just ""disappear,"" and so on. The spectres are also not bound by the time/space continuum as we know it, often creating temporal shifts and so-forth. Also, in the ""Juon"" series, each attack has the potential for creating a new ""juon"" (i.e., the victim could then be 'reborn,' as it were, as another vengeful spirit), but ""The Grudge"" plays down this aspect of the curse and pretty much just sticks with building up the body count. And unlike ""RING,"" there is no way to break the curse or to keep it from spreading other than to just stay out of that damned house.And though Mr. Raimi chose to keep the story set in its native Japan and limited the use of Caucasian actors, I am convinced that the film could have just as easily been set in NYC, L.A., or here in Honolulu, where heavy Asian populations reside and speak English as their native language, assuming that it was his intent was to cater to Japanese or other Asian cultural themes. Such a move could have been just as effective and would have given him better rationale for using Caucasian-American actors. But because of using a new cast of white American characters in Japan while having key members of the Japanese cast reprise their original roles, the story as it plays out in the remake loses some of its effectiveness and justifications, due to the inability to duplicate certain situations which account for some of the specific behaviors associated with certain characters, thus resulting in slightly different interpretations of the two films.As far as recommending this movie on its own merits, I'd have no problem encouraging the 'uninitiated' to give it a fair look.To those who are familiar with any of the ""Juon"" presentations (esp. those privileged enough to have viewed all four original entries), my recommendation comes a bit harder. Again, as I've already expressed, my specific prejudices have already influenced my decision to not include this remake in my personal collection, but if you're stoked to see a remake that is ""truly"" a remake, which remains very faithful to the original and refuses to take ""dumbed-down"" Hollywood-style 'liberties' with the source material, then you just might appreciate this movie on that level. On the other hand, if you, like myself, appreciated the ethereal qualities and slow-pace of the originals, I'm not so enthusiastic about recommending it outright, and I would suggest renting it out first before jumping in head-first.In any event, it's really not a terrible movie; and for newbies, it could open a whole new window into Asian cinema. ~ Aloha!",3,"""beGrudgingly""

872486,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006SGYL0,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 5]","I will be completely honest with you, I watched this film with my finger on the fast-forward button pressed heavily so that the jumpy scenes wouldn't make me change my pants.  I thought that this was one of the spookiest films that I have seen.  Director Takashi Shimizu has done an excellent job remaking this film for American audiences.  While some will argue that this is nothing more than just corporate Hollywood turning the cranks on audiences' wallets, I thought there was quite a bit of originality to this film.  The institution of us seeing the demon or spirits before the characters do was something that I wasn't familiar with in other horror films.  Normally, there is this big ""jumping out of the darkness"" scene that frightens everyone because they were not expecting it, but in The Grudge there was this element of ""here I am"" that frightened me more than most films do.Takashi Shimizu, the mastermind behind this film, also created the original Ju-on series that became extremely popular in Japan.  This allowed his vision and purpose (with a larger budget) to continue.  I enjoyed the fact that the original director was on board and that our American crew was in Japan.  This took me away from the idea that this film was going to be nothing more than just a pro-America horror film.  It took me to this unfamiliar place (building the fear) and showcased the talents of some unfamiliar/familiar American film actors working next to a complete Japanese crew.  I thought that this kept the entire film grounded.  It wasn't set in New York, there wasn't the scene of raw nudity at the beginning ... there wasn't the normal American structure to this film because we were not in America ... we were in Japan.  This really helped me build the excitement and utter terror that I felt while watching this film.  I was impressed.The acting, well, you don't go to a horror film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting.  Gellar and Pullman knew that the horror genre is slowing coming into the limelight as a prominent figure in cinema (it was lacking for a couple of years there) and I think that is why they chose to do this project.  Pullman wasn't anything to write home about, thought I was impressed to see him in this film.  Gellar was the exact same.  She did her part, collected her money, and went home.  This wasn't what frightened me about this film.  I didn't rent this movie to be blown away by the acting.  I expected average acting and that is what I got.  What I did go into this film expecting was to shake, shiver, and be frightened to turn off the lights after the film.  That is exactly what I found. Takashi Shimizu did an excellent job of building that right amount of suspense, using amazing lighting, perfect sound, and some very freaky visuals.  His knowledge and ability to bring us something new was extremely impressive and honest.  Here is a director who was handed the money to make the film that he wanted, and while not everything was probably to his liking, it did open the door for more fans to enjoy his work.  It also opened the door to more projects from his mind to be released.  This could be the new face of cinematic horror, and I cannot wait to see what he has in store for us.Overall, I loved this movie.  It was the exact level of fright that I was looking for.  There were scenes that I never saw coming, there were elements that were unexpected and vividly raw, and it thankfully did not follow the ever-classic Hollywood horror formula.  There was originality and emotion in this film that most horror directors do not give when dabbing in the horror genre.  This was a great story, and I cannot wait to gather friends for a late night horror scream-fest featuring this film.  From the opening scene, to the bus scene, to the opportunistic final moment, I had my finger on the fast-forward and I was scared.  This did what it set out to do for me, and for that I can only praise this film!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,There is something evil there.,1112832000,"04 7, 2005",2005,3970,"['will', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'watched', 'film', 'finger', 'fast-forward', 'button', 'pressed', 'heavily', 'so', 'jumpy', 'scenes', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'change', 'pants', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'spookiest', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'Director', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'remaking', 'film', 'American', 'audiences', 'will', 'argue', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'corporate', 'Hollywood', 'turning', 'cranks', 'audiences', 'wallets', 'thought', 'there', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'originality', 'film', 'institution', 'seeing', 'demon', 'spirits', 'characters', 'do', 'was', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'Normally', 'big', 'jumping', 'darkness', 'scene', 'everyone', 'were', 'not', 'expecting', 'Grudge', 'was', 'element', 'here', 'am', 'frightened', 'more', 'most', 'films', 'do.Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'mastermind', 'film', 'also', 'created', 'original', 'Ju-on', 'series', 'became', 'extremely', 'popular', 'Japan', 'allowed', 'vision', 'purpose', 'larger', 'budget', 'continue', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'original', 'director', 'was', 'board', 'American', 'crew', 'was', 'Japan', 'took', 'away', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'pro-America', 'horror', 'film', 'took', 'unfamiliar', 'place', 'building', 'fear', 'showcased', 'talents', 'unfamiliar/familiar', 'American', 'film', 'actors', 'working', 'next', 'complete', 'Japanese', 'crew', 'thought', 'kept', 'entire', 'film', 'grounded', 'was', ""n't"", 'set', 'New', 'York', 'was', ""n't"", 'scene', 'raw', 'nudity', 'beginning', 'was', ""n't"", 'normal', 'American', 'structure', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'America', 'were', 'Japan', 'really', 'helped', 'build', 'excitement', 'utter', 'terror', 'felt', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'impressed.The', 'acting', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'horror', 'film', 'expecting', 'see', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'acting', 'Gellar', 'Pullman', 'knew', 'horror', 'genre', 'slowing', 'coming', 'limelight', 'prominent', 'figure', 'cinema', 'was', 'lacking', 'couple', 'years', 'there', 'think', 'why', 'chose', 'do', 'project', 'Pullman', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'thought', 'was', 'impressed', 'see', 'film', 'Gellar', 'was', 'exact', 'same', 'did', 'part', 'collected', 'money', 'went', 'home', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'frightened', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'rent', 'movie', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'acting', 'expected', 'average', 'acting', 'what', 'got', 'What', 'did', 'go', 'film', 'expecting', 'was', 'shake', 'shiver', 'be', 'frightened', 'turn', 'off', 'lights', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'found', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'building', 'right', 'amount', 'suspense', 'using', 'amazing', 'lighting', 'perfect', 'sound', 'very', 'freaky', 'visuals', 'knowledge', 'ability', 'bring', 'something', 'new', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressive', 'honest', 'Here', 'director', 'who', 'was', 'handed', 'money', 'make', 'film', 'wanted', 'not', 'everything', 'was', 'probably', 'liking', 'did', 'open', 'door', 'more', 'fans', 'enjoy', 'work', 'also', 'opened', 'door', 'more', 'projects', 'mind', 'be', 'released', 'could', 'be', 'new', 'face', 'cinematic', 'horror', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'store', 'us.Overall', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'exact', 'level', 'fright', 'was', 'looking', 'were', 'scenes', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'were', 'elements', 'were', 'unexpected', 'vividly', 'raw', 'thankfully', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'ever-classic', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'formula', 'was', 'originality', 'emotion', 'film', 'most', 'horror', 'directors', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'when', 'dabbing', 'horror', 'genre', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'gather', 'friends', 'late', 'night', 'horror', 'scream-fest', 'featuring', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'bus', 'scene', 'opportunistic', 'final', 'moment', 'had', 'finger', 'fast-forward', 'was', 'scared', 'did', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'can', 'only', 'praise', 'film', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A

I am tired of horror movies that involve Freddy and Jason and last but not least how could we forget our favorite adorable killing doll Chuckie. Seeing this film I must admit is scary. The film uses dark elements to make the film prosper. But the film could have used more. The plot wasn't exactly a ""plot"" and there wasn't really much to see except ""The Grudge"" a demented like being that crawls around in the attic. If you can actually understand the Japanese darkness part element of the film you can understand the horror in the film. The Grudge definetly isn't the best film out there but it definetly puts a horror show out there for its audience. But once again I will say the plot simply-sucks. There isn't much to it besides a bunch of running around and looking in the attic. I would definetly reccomend this film on a night where you have nothing to do and feel like a good scare...",3,Japanese Elements Make This Film Great.,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,1088,"['Basically', 'everyone', 'told', 'had', 'see', 'Grudge', 'contained', 'plot', 'were', 'right', 'Grudge', 'might', 'look', 'Ring', 'rip', 'not', 'originally', 'japanese', 'film', 'am', 'tired', 'horror', 'movies', 'involve', 'Freddy', 'Jason', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'how', 'could', 'forget', 'favorite', 'adorable', 'killing', 'doll', 'Chuckie', 'Seeing', 'film', 'must', 'admit', 'scary', 'film', 'dark', 'elements', 'make', 'film', 'prosper', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'see', 'Grudge', 'demented', 'being', 'crawls', 'around', 'attic', 'can', 'actually', 'understand', 'Japanese', 'darkness', 'part', 'element', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'horror', 'film', 'Grudge', 'definetly', ""n't"", 'best', 'film', 'there', 'definetly', 'horror', 'show', 'there', 'audience', 'once', 'again', 'will', 'say', 'plot', 'simply-sucks', ""n't"", 'much', 'bunch', 'running', 'around', 'looking', 'attic', 'would', 'definetly', 'reccomend', 'film', 'night', 'where', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'feel', 'good', 'scare']",N/A
872496,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B0006SGYL0,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[5, 6]","According to The Grudge, there's a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage, then a curse is left behind. It's a ""stain"" that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred, and it will kill everything it touches. All I can say is if that were true then the movie-going public better hope I never die in a theater. The audience at this movie was probably the most obnoxious crowd I've ever had the displeasure of watching a movie with. Talk about being in a powerful grip of rage. More on that later.Jump scenes rule the day here. That's right, this baby is stocked with jump scenes! If you're having a hard time deciphering my complicated terminology, then let me explain that a ""jump scene"" is one in which something startling happens to catch you off guard and makes you jump in your seat. Some people think jump scenes are cheap ploys to get a scare from the audience, but they're really well done in this movie. And they're manufactured frequently and shrewdly enough to keep you in a constant state of unease.Unfortunately, when most moviegoers get scared they like to scream and then laugh and talk about it for 2 minutes afterwards. If you're gonna scream then scream. But then SHUT UP and WATCH THE MOVIE! This ain't a comedy and it certainly isn't a coffeehouse, so quit killin' my atmosphere.Some of you might be a little agitated to know that The Grudge does follow some clich&eacute;d horror movie conventions, such as a character investigating a creepy noise in a dark attic with only a cigarette lighter to illuminate the way. And of course, one character has to slowly follow a strange figure that shouldn't be there in the first place. But it's forgivable. Keep in mind, characters aren't necessarily supposed to know they're in a horror movie. I'm sure we've all explored strange noises before, except rather than a horrific, disfigured ghost producing the noise, in real life the sound is usually coming from Uncle Larry's bathroom excursion. Never underestimate the horror of a night out at the Taco Bell.Comparisons to The Ring are inevitable, so I'll just say that I personally feel The Grudge is the creepier of the two. This is a movie that's heavy on atmosphere and freaky imagery. The Japanese ghosts creeped me out even more than the time I caught some pervert staring at me in the men's bathroom stall back in my college days. Lucky for him, he took off before I had a chance to demonstrate what happens when a person is caught in a powerful grip of rage.But The Ring has the better story and a much better ending. The Grudge does a great job of keeping you guessing. You never really know where it's going, and since the story isn't linear you really have to pay attention. I know a lot of you have the attention span of a goldfish (about 9 seconds, you just learned something today, thank me later), so this may be problematic. I think it works fairly well, but one of my complaints is that near the end everything is wrapped up and explained rather quickly.As a result, I wish the movie had been longer. A longer running time could've produced more in-depth character development, a more clever way to explain what was going on, and maybe even a better ending. And there's my biggest complaint. Why do so many horror movies feel the need to use the I Know What You Did Last Summer-esque ""look, there's gonna be a sequel"" ending? Come on, how about some closure? It's similar to if you're waiting for me to close out my review in a witty and funny fashion, but instead, for some reason I just decide to end the review in mid sent...THE GISTIf you're looking for some Halloween entertainment, then The Grudge will give you some good jumps and surround you with creepy imagery. But I strongly recommend that you see it at a time when there won't be a big crowd because I know I would've enjoyed the movie a lot more had I not been surrounded by a lot of stand-up comedians who felt the need to crack jokes at the most tense and inopportune times. Folks, this is a horror movie. Tension and atmosphere are a big part of it... I look forward to watching the DVD in peace and quiet one day where the only idiots I'll possibly be surrounded by will be friends and family.Rating: 4 (out of 5)",4,good quality horror from master Sam Raimi,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,4254,"['According', 'Grudge', 'Japanese', 'belief', 'when', 'someone', 'powerful', 'grip', 'rage', 'then', 'curse', 'left', 'stain', 'forever', 'part', 'place', 'where', 'death', 'occurred', 'will', 'kill', 'everything', 'can', 'say', 'were', 'true', 'then', 'movie-going', 'public', 'better', 'hope', 'never', 'die', 'theater', 'audience', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'crowd', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'displeasure', 'watching', 'movie', 'Talk', 'being', 'powerful', 'grip', 'rage', 'More', 'later.Jump', 'rule', 'day', 'here', 'right', 'baby', 'stocked', 'jump', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'deciphering', 'complicated', 'terminology', 'then', 'let', 'explain', 'jump', 'scene', 'one', 'something', 'startling', 'happens', 'catch', 'off', 'guard', 'jump', 'seat', 'people', 'think', 'jump', 'scenes', 'are', 'cheap', 'ploys', 'get', 'scare', 'audience', ""'re"", 'really', 'well', 'done', 'movie', ""'re"", 'manufactured', 'frequently', 'shrewdly', 'enough', 'keep', 'constant', 'state', 'unease.Unfortunately', 'when', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'get', 'scared', 'like', 'scream', 'then', 'laugh', 'talk', '2', 'minutes', 'afterwards', ""'re"", 'gon', 'scream', 'then', 'scream', 'then', 'SHUT', 'UP', 'WATCH', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'ai', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'coffeehouse', 'so', 'quit', 'killin', 'atmosphere.Some', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'agitated', 'know', 'Grudge', 'follow', 'clich', 'eacute', 'horror', 'movie', 'conventions', 'such', 'character', 'investigating', 'creepy', 'noise', 'dark', 'attic', 'only', 'cigarette', 'lighter', 'illuminate', 'way', 'course', 'one', 'character', 'slowly', 'follow', 'strange', 'figure', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'forgivable', 'Keep', 'mind', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'supposed', 'know', ""'re"", 'horror', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'explored', 'strange', 'noises', 'rather', 'horrific', 'disfigured', 'ghost', 'producing', 'noise', 'real', 'life', 'sound', 'usually', 'coming', 'Uncle', 'Larry', 'bathroom', 'excursion', 'Never', 'underestimate', 'horror', 'night', 'out', 'Taco', 'Bell.Comparisons', 'Ring', 'are', 'inevitable', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'personally', 'feel', 'Grudge', 'creepier', 'two', 'movie', 'heavy', 'atmosphere', 'freaky', 'imagery', 'Japanese', 'ghosts', 'creeped', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'time', 'caught', 'pervert', 'staring', 'men', 'bathroom', 'stall', 'back', 'college', 'days', 'Lucky', 'took', 'off', 'had', 'chance', 'demonstrate', 'what', 'when', 'person', 'caught', 'powerful', 'grip', 'rage.But', 'Ring', 'better', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'ending', 'Grudge', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'story', ""n't"", 'linear', 'really', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'know', 'lot', 'have', 'attention', 'span', 'goldfish', '9', 'seconds', 'just', 'learned', 'something', 'today', 'thank', 'later', 'may', 'be', 'problematic', 'think', 'fairly', 'well', 'one', 'complaints', 'end', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'explained', 'rather', 'quickly.As', 'result', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'longer', 'A', 'longer', 'running', 'time', 'could', ""'ve"", 'produced', 'more', 'in-depth', 'character', 'development', 'more', 'clever', 'way', 'explain', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'maybe', 'even', 'better', 'ending', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Why', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'feel', 'need', 'use', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer-esque', 'look', 'gon', 'be', 'sequel', 'ending', 'Come', 'how', 'closure', 'similar', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'close', 'out', 'review', 'witty', 'funny', 'fashion', 'instead', 'reason', 'just', 'decide', 'end', 'review', 'mid', 'sent', 'THE', 'GISTIf', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Halloween', 'entertainment', 'then', 'Grudge', 'will', 'give', 'good', 'jumps', 'surround', 'creepy', 'imagery', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'see', 'time', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'crowd', 'know', 'would', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'surrounded', 'lot', 'stand-up', 'comedians', 'who', 'felt', 'need', 'crack', 'jokes', 'most', 'tense', 'inopportune', 'times', 'Folks', 'horror', 'movie', 'Tension', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'big', 'part', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'DVD', 'peace', 'quiet', 'one', 'day', 'where', 'only', 'idiots', ""'ll"", 'possibly', 'be', 'surrounded', 'will', 'be', 'friends', 'family.Rating', '4', '5']",N/A

Basically here is what you are paying for when you see The Grudge, cheap acting (not the worst but nothing that special, except for the dumbass kid and Sarah Michelle Gellar who cannot act to save her life), horrible incoherrent plot line that involves a story that is never fully explained or makes sense in the end, and another failed attempt of making a decent horror movie by hollywood.it does start off in an interesting way, but quickly slows down and falls into a deep pit of retardation and psychologically traumetizing idiocy for the audiance. not only that but everything was predictable such as the boy appearing on the different levels as sarah's character passes on the elevator, sarah not leaving the house in the last seen (the golden rule of horror films, make something so insignificant and god damn stupid keep the main character in the path of danger just to drag another 5 minutes of 'terror' into the movie), and finding out the ghost (phantom, whatever the hell i still dont care) boy's father killed him and his mother at the end.....heres a big question for all you people, why the hell did that happen? just cause the mother was interested in another man? then where the hell is the mother and why do they kill people for no random reason?please if you consider yourself a person that loves good films than avoid this, ignore all the 5 star reviews. i dont know any of these people personally so i wont say that they are retarded or stupid, but maybe they were high at the time or they got paid to say those things.

For one thing. Ugh, the acting was just really really bad.  It made the movie as a whole just look like a really really low budget old godzilla movie.  The script was just as bad.However, like the godzilla movies, there's just something interesting about the plot that grabs you.  Now the original grudge done in japan ju-on would've been better but it was a little dragged out and well, i'm too used to american special effects. low budget america and low budget japan are two different things. low budget america means cartoon like computer graphics that glow off the screen and looks like a joke, and japan low budget is like, home video camera and planets hanging from little strings.  dont know how anime manages to rock so much with their graphics but i dont think their film industry's quite there yet.anyway, so ju-on had too many random characters that all did their own thing and met up with the grudge. it was okay but kind of like reading a weekly comic book series with a new episode and adventure every week. so what america does is realize this and chop it up and cut out characters and shorten other characters parts to leave room for a main character and i'm left even more confused with the newer version than the original.so now i'm complaining that ju-on dragged, and the grudge was a rushed chopped up piece of bad acted out liver with sarah michelle geller in it who really really disappointed me considering the fact that i know who she is and therefore i want to be impressed by a veteran actress and instead had to sit there thinking how old she was starting to look. that's bad. when i sit there just thinking that you're more wrinkled than you were in buffy that means you need to try harder.however, this is why it gets three stars and not two or one. the japanese version didn't really go anywhere. it introduced the grudge concept. showed off the grudge concept. end. it just did it and that was it. the american version tried to tie it together a little and show why it happened and explained things in a more timely manner. basically like, lets unfold this mystery. this is the mystery building up. this is why. japan was kind of like. this is the grudge. growl. scare. roar. grudge. grrrr. end.like i said. both movies kind of sucked. i liked it cause i like horror movies but ju-on impressed me more with the scary scenes even with the lesser special effects and comic book like pace and america kind of bored me in that way with the rushed chopped liver aspect. they just didn't reproduce the scary moments well enough and didn't come up with enough unique ones all on their own. but the end was a teeny tiny bit better in the american version. not the whole end. but the endish area was a little better. however, the bad part was america threw in a really cheap thing all of a sudden out of nowhere that america always does where the main character tries to be the hero whereas in the japanese version she was the victim only. end.My whole point? good concept. done badly. japan's was better overall.  should've tried harder or not at all. could've been great i think. they had the right idea to try a remake just didn't give it their all. they should've taken full advantage of our special effects because that's really sad that the planets hanging from little strings in a video camera impressed me more than our own computer graphics.i also liked and hated the fact that it was also in japan. for godsake's why dont you just use the same freaking movie set and actors for crying out loud. geez. can't you be a little creative?  not only are we gonna remake a movie almost word for word and image for image, lets make it in the exact same house, in the exact same city, in the exact same foreign language. its like, why'd you even bother with an american version if youre gonna make it in frickin japan. just so you could replace the main character for sarah michelle geller?

Same director, same locations. Same basic story.  And with this version, I get Sarah Michelle Gellar--though a sadder, more chastened Sarah Michelle Gellar I've never seen.  Her character was badly in need of a Prozac through the whole film.  It was like Angel had just gone bad again.Some people have complained about the disjointed storytelling.  For the most part, this worked fine for me.  It added a level of drama and mystery to the whole thing that we wouldn't have had if the story had been chronological.  We're not only interested in what is happening, but in why.Unfortunately, the pay-off is not so grand.  The forces that called these onryou--these vengeful spirits--into being are slightly questionable, and the way they function--especially outside the confines of the house--is never clear.That said, the movie had some creepy atmospherics and a deft hand with the jump scenes.

872501,A26O6MQFA36WBK,B0006SGYL0,A Reviewer,"[0, 0]","It takes a lot to scare me in a movie, but Ju-On 3 did. Very terrifying movie. After seeing that, obviously, I wanted to see this American Remake of it, which is from the same director but with an American cast. While this just isn't as scary, it is still a great movie with some chilling scenes and big jump scares.The plot of a movie is essentially that ""when someone dies in a fit of rage, their curse is left in an area. All who enter are consumed by it's fury."" Therefore, there's a house where very bad things had happened in the past, and everyone who enters the house will be killed by these very scary spirits. They follow you around anywhere, and show up at any time, eventually killing you.Ju-On 3 was really more episodic than anything. It went from one character to another, essentially showing their deaths due to entering a house where deadly spirits live. The Grudge, though, takes one of the characters from Ju-On 3 and makes her the main character. So we have a little more plot here. As a result, though, the movie's not as scary. The Japanese version went from scare to scare, but this remake has to stop the scares sometimes to bring some plot into the picture. As a result, I was a little disappointed when I first saw this remake. My favorite scares from the Japanese version were either cut, or simply made less scary, (such as the security tapes scene.) But after seeing the movie again, I realized that, while the Japanese version is a lot better, this version still has it's strengths, and still has many scares, while bringing a plot into the picture.If you want to see a movie for scares and nothing else, (and don't mind the subtitles,) see Ju-On 3. (Known in the US simply as Ju-On) instead of the remake. But if you want a stronger plot, a little less confusion (the Japanese version, admittedly, can be hard to follow,)an American cast, and are willing to settle for a less scary version, then see The Grudge. There are still some great scares here, and there are even a couple new ones that are fairly well done. Plus, the finale is a little more intense here. So, both this remake and Ju-on have their strengths and weaknesses. It's ultimately up to you which one to see. If you have no interest in a Japanese movie, then see The Grudge. It is definitely a scary remake.Note; there are 2 versions of this movie you can buy; the Theatrical Version, and the Director's Cut. I HIGHLY recommend the director's cut. It has 8 minutes of extra footage, (much of it cut to get the movie a PG13 rating,) and it's definitely even scarrier. So if you want a great, scary, and sometimes complex movie, then see The Grudge, (But make sure it's the Director's Cut version...) or, even better yet, see the Japanese original.",4,"Not as scary as the Japanese original, but still great",1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,2744,"['lot', 'scare', 'movie', 'Ju-On', '3', 'did', 'Very', 'terrifying', 'movie', 'seeing', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'see', 'American', 'Remake', 'same', 'director', 'American', 'cast', 'just', ""n't"", 'scary', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'chilling', 'scenes', 'big', 'jump', 'scares.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'essentially', 'when', 'someone', 'fit', 'rage', 'curse', 'left', 'area', 'who', 'enter', 'are', 'consumed', 'fury', 'Therefore', 'house', 'where', 'very', 'bad', 'things', 'had', 'happened', 'past', 'everyone', 'who', 'house', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'very', 'scary', 'spirits', 'follow', 'anywhere', 'show', 'up', 'time', 'eventually', 'killing', 'you.Ju-On', '3', 'was', 'really', 'more', 'episodic', 'anything', 'went', 'one', 'character', 'essentially', 'showing', 'deaths', 'due', 'entering', 'house', 'where', 'deadly', 'spirits', 'live', 'Grudge', 'though', 'one', 'characters', 'Ju-On', '3', 'main', 'character', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'plot', 'here', 'result', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'Japanese', 'version', 'went', 'scare', 'scare', 'remake', 'stop', 'scares', 'sometimes', 'bring', 'plot', 'picture', 'result', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'remake', 'favorite', 'scares', 'Japanese', 'version', 'were', 'either', 'cut', 'simply', 'made', 'less', 'scary', 'such', 'security', 'tapes', 'scene', 'seeing', 'movie', 'again', 'realized', 'Japanese', 'version', 'lot', 'better', 'version', 'still', 'strengths', 'still', 'many', 'scares', 'bringing', 'plot', 'picture.If', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'scares', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subtitles', 'see', 'Ju-On', '3', 'Known', 'US', 'simply', 'Ju-On', 'instead', 'remake', 'want', 'stronger', 'plot', 'little', 'less', 'confusion', 'Japanese', 'version', 'admittedly', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'follow', 'American', 'cast', 'are', 'willing', 'settle', 'less', 'scary', 'version', 'then', 'see', 'Grudge', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'scares', 'here', 'are', 'even', 'couple', 'new', 'ones', 'are', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'finale', 'little', 'more', 'intense', 'here', 'So', 'remake', 'Ju-on', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'ultimately', 'one', 'see', 'have', 'interest', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'then', 'see', 'Grudge', 'definitely', 'scary', 'remake.Note', 'are', '2', 'versions', 'movie', 'can', 'buy', 'Theatrical', 'Version', 'Director', 'Cut', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'director', 'cut', '8', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'much', 'cut', 'get', 'movie', 'PG13', 'rating', 'definitely', 'even', 'scarrier', 'So', 'want', 'great', 'scary', 'sometimes', 'complex', 'movie', 'then', 'see', 'Grudge', 'make', 'sure', 'Director', 'Cut', 'version', 'even', 'better', 'yet', 'see', 'Japanese', 'original']",N/A

""Night_Hawk07""","[3, 4]","The first film wasn't anything special and a little forgettable but was interesting because of some pretty good acting and storytelling. Sarah Michelle Gellar did a fantastic job as Karen in the previous film but it's extremely disappointing to see her role drastically reduced in this film. It's almost as if the producers only wanted her to return because they knew she was a huge draw in the first film, partly because of her dedicated ""Buffy"" fans.It's no secret that the character of Karen doesn't last very long and she is her successor is her sister played by Amber Tamblyn. Tamblyn, who turned in a great performance on her two years of ""Joan of Arcadia"" does the best she can with her character (which has a total of two facial expressions throughout the whole movie: devastated and confused). I suspect it's the writers fault for not giving the character anything to do because she drifts throughout the whole movie not knowing what is going on.The storyline itself is pretty intriguing. In the first film, the curse of Kayako was contained within the house but in this film it's moving to the outside world. What's intriguing about this storyline fails with all the cutting between different story lines. The secondary characters aren't very interesting and the death scenes are just horrible. They come and go  and you can automatically tell from the beginning who will die or live.The ending of the film is what makes the film better. It probably will leave a lot of people confused or angry by how abstract it is but I think it'll lead perfectly into a third ""Grudge"", if they make one.",3,A lot of potential that it doesn't live up to,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,1600,"['first', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'little', 'forgettable', 'was', 'interesting', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'storytelling', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Karen', 'previous', 'film', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'see', 'role', 'drastically', 'reduced', 'film', 'almost', 'producers', 'only', 'wanted', 'return', 'knew', 'was', 'huge', 'draw', 'first', 'film', 'partly', 'dedicated', 'Buffy', 'fans.It', 'secret', 'character', 'Karen', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'successor', 'sister', 'played', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'Tamblyn', 'who', 'turned', 'great', 'performance', 'two', 'years', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'best', 'can', 'character', 'total', 'two', 'facial', 'expressions', 'whole', 'movie', 'devastated', 'confused', 'suspect', 'writers', 'fault', 'not', 'giving', 'character', 'anything', 'do', 'whole', 'movie', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'intriguing', 'first', 'film', 'curse', 'Kayako', 'was', 'contained', 'house', 'film', 'moving', 'outside', 'world', 'What', 'intriguing', 'storyline', 'cutting', 'different', 'story', 'lines', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'horrible', 'come', 'go', 'can', 'automatically', 'tell', 'beginning', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'live.The', 'ending', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'better', 'probably', 'will', 'leave', 'lot', 'people', 'confused', 'angry', 'how', 'abstract', 'think', ""'ll"", 'lead', 'perfectly', 'third', 'Grudge', 'make', 'one']",N/A

Can't anyone come up with an original idea and not have to borrow from past movies (IE- the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre, those awful Jason movies, etc. and the even worse Alien Vs. Predator) and Japanese horror films (The Ring, anyone?)? Alright. All that aside. This is a so so movie. I was scared most of the time, I'll give it that, but I was left disappointed with too many questions floating around in my head. I don't just want to be scared. I crave a great story. A story that begs to be told. This one so does not do this!Basically, the movie is about a family who moves into a new hosue in Japan. Yes the house is lovely. Yes you must take your shoes off when you enter, even if it is your house. Strange things begin to happen to this family. The mother begins to stare at the wall. Her son is worried and his wife is nervous about living in Japan. The movie moves back and forth between several stories, one of which is this one about the family. The other is about Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, a student who is assigned to visit the seemingly senile mother in this freaky house. I love how Gellar walks toward the house so slowly and looks back and forth like a manic squirrel. She's never been there before. What's there to be afraid of yet? Anyway, she begins to see things too. Soon people end up disappearing. Dying. Seeing little boys who meow. Very strange. What's the deal with this house? What's happening to everyone? What's Bill Pullman jumping out a window in the beginning have to do with the story? It's convoluted, but it's not too hard to follow.It kinda reminded me of The Ring, just the way it looks and how the tone is. I like The Ring better, though. This movie did scare me. I actually had to stay up and watch Full House just to get it out of my system. Ugh. Some of the images are just horrifying. And imagine having a younger sister who wants to freeze frame them all and stare at them for countless minutes and laugh at you while you squirm. You want a good scare? Check this out.

First, the ghosts had no idea how to do things ""comme il faut"".  Where was the build-up of suspense, fear, and terror?  What was this uncouth business of attacking people barely two minutes after they entered the house?  I mean, really!  Second, I was taken aback (and displeased by) the ghosts' ability to do physical harm.  What were they, ghosts -- or goons?  And the reverse should be true as well, shouldn't it?  What were these people waiting for to bring a baseball bat down on the heads of these creeps?  If nothing else, it would have given me enormous satisfaction -- I found the unrelenting and indiscriminate nature of the ghosts' vengefulness extremely irritating and tiresome.  Finally, I thought it ridiculous that anyone and everyone who so much as dared to set a toe in the house was doomed (not just in the house, but regardless of where they went).

But things changed with the success of ""The Ring"" and how good it was. Now with this latest American re-do of a Japanese horror film called ""Ju-On"", the concept of re-making these foreign films for American audiences continues it's welcomed translation into another solid piece of spooky chills and thrills. It may not grow in stature as ""The Ring"", but this film can be as equally chilling in spots. One of the main reasons that this tale and the movie works is that it is not entirely American. It is shot in Tokyo, with a lot of it's natives behind the scenes, and in front of the camera. The original director, Takashi Shimizu, is also on board directing this new version of his original film. To make it more accessible, Sarah Michelle Geller, Bill Pullman, Jason Behr, and a few others, are thrown into the mix. Sarah Michelle stars in her first feature film since the end of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", and she seems to be able to make the transition from TV queen to silver screen scream queen with little effort. She just works. She stars as Karen, an American student who is wokring for a care house for credit. She is living in Tokyo with her boyfriend Doug(Behr, from TV's ""Roswell"", who had also co-starred with Sarah in a season 2 episode of ""Buffy"" as well). When a care worker goes missing, after a spooky opening, Karen is given her job. To care for a sick old lady in a weird house that gives off one major bad vibe. Karen immediatley begins having weird feelings when she arrives at the house. Things are just not right. From here on out, events occur, people die, and Karen tries to figure out exactly what happened in that house and how to save herself from being sucked into the house's previous owners' deadly grip. As it goes, when someone dies in a kind of fury or rage, their spirits are left behind to carry out a curse to whoever enters. It's a pretty interesting premise that mostly works. It may brings up some questions that never really get answered, but we don't neccessarily watch these movies for that, do we?. The movie is shot well, and it really uses every area and nook and cranny they got to the fullest effect. They definitley create an ominous and scary feel and look. The movie itself is definitley a spine tingler. It has many scenes that are well structured to the point of being genuinley creepy and scary. A rare feat in today's climate of expected ""jump scares"". The cast is pretty good too. Sarah, thru her years on ""Buffy"", has proven to be an exceptional actress. This is her area, and she knows how to work it. Despite looking as lovely as usual, she is a fine horror actress and does the most with what she can with what is essentially a typical heroine role. She is good, but the character could of been better expanded on for her. Bill Pullman has a fairly small role, mostly seen in flashbacks. Jason Behr as Doug was basically wasted in a pretty transparent role. He really had nothing going on with the character. I guess other ones and situations came first. The movie is different in that it takes it's time creating the backstory for the bloody mystery, and how the current situation Karen and others are in came to be.

I've seen horror movies that range back to the oringial Frankinstien and Dracula up to this recent film ""The Grudge."" Out of the 100+ horror movies I have seen three have struck me as ""scary"" and this was not one of them.1)The ShiningWhy: Ingenious directing by Stanley Kubrick, and amazing acting from jack nicholson2)My little eyeWhy: The very clever use of webcams and sharp writing3)CandymanWhy: One of the few ""mad slasher"" horror movies I've seen with and exeptionally smart plot (with the exception of ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" and ""Psycho"")The reason ""The Grudge"" is not scary is because it lacked all of the things that made the movies above scary. As I said with the Shining ""ingenious directing and acting"" and we all know Shara Michelle Geller is not the greatest of actors/actress and the way this was directed made it look low budget and like a student film. As for the writing, it's not sharp at all. Although you can understand the movie, it all made sense to me, but in the end, if you think about it, it's....well, pointless. And as far as psychological horror...it tries to be psychological by lacking gore, sex, and drugs, and while that is all well and good, taking a pointless killer movie and taking these out these things does not make it psychologically scary. Candyman was very gory, and it had drugs, and a little sex, but it was still scary. And the writer apparently thought he had a great idea by having a ghost with a grudge on someone, and by the time he's almost done with the script he remebers that he never gave this ghost a reason to kill people. So, he writes a random idea (say, a woman falling in love with another man, while she is married, for no apparent reason) and he hopes the viewer would not understand and just find the jump scenes scary.

There were no scares. There was no gore. The characters had no depth and no personality. The set was a typical Japanese home with no character.  There was no tension, as you could flawlessly predict whether someone would live or die.  Never once did you feel tension towards their outcome, and never did you care, as they were cardboard, anyway.The movie begins with promise. The colors and angles will feel familiar if you saw the Ring, but it begins with promise, giving a mysterious death and a very creepy child.It doesn't last, though. You soon realize that the deaths happen off camera and are usually unexplained. You realize the main ghost is a very confused looking Japanese woman with a facial expression that is supposed to be terror but is so over the top it's pure humor. And you'll realize the characters have no purpose other than to die. None of them say anything interesting, none have any unique characteristics. You could take the lines from one mouth and put them in another without noticing.*minor spoiler* The end is terrible, too. The ghost gets a character face to face, inches away, but saves the character instead of killing the character. Of course, this doesn't stop the ghost from stalking the character and giving the ""surprise"" in the end. Why didn't it just kill the character when it had the chance? *end spoiler*A movie with a decent concept but terrible, dull, and mindless execution.

872510,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0006SGYL0,B. E Jackson,"[16, 18]","WOW.  That's the only thing I can say after reading all sorts of negative reviews.  I admit, the very first time I watched the Grudge with my father NEITHER of us thought the movie was scary at all and couldn't understand its success, but after watching the movie a second time two months later by myself late at night I REALLY began to see how frightening the movie is.  Probably contains the same amount of fear as the original Exorcist, another movie that's really effectively well done.  You HAVE to watch the Exorcist and the Grudge at night to get the proper effect.The Grudge benefits greatly when it comes to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story.  I say ""pretty interesting"" because the storyline isn't the best, or the easiest to understand.  Just interesting enough to get the job done.  The Grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving away too much or too little.  In fact, this is probably its strongest point.Every time something scary happens, you see just a ""little bit"" of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange shadow effect, which is *very* important if you want to effectively scare someone.  If the scary boy had appeared on screen for longer than a few seconds it wouldn't have scared me nearly as much because I would have gotten used to seeing it.  The boy appears, and then he's gone.  Not giving away too much REALLY works with this movie.  You see, to really scare me you simply CAN'T put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and you HAVE to create a moody atmosphere to make the film believable.  The Grudge works *extremely* well it this area.The fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in the Grudge allows me to give the film another compliment.  I'm telling you, the scene with the woman inside that building by herself (well, except for a security guard) and having to travel home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes of total bone-chilling excitement.  I *loved* this scene.I was totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was finally going to have something bad happen to her.  The scene where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was *awesome*, and the scene a few moments after this happened where she DID see something in the shadow was ANOTHER awesome display of bone-chilling brilliance.  There's a bunch of scenes like this throughout the movie.  Freakin' AWESOME!Excellent pacing and suspense makes the Grudge a true horror classic, in my opinion.  I've seen a thousand horror movies in my time and I'd easily put the Grudge right up there as one of the best.People today have drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a movie scary.  Remember the good old days when everyone could agree that the Exorcist was the scariest movie of all-time?  I wish everyone agreed that the Grudge is a total classic, and that the Ring is another excellent one.",5,completely satisfying,1160870400,"10 15, 2006",2006,2979,"['WOW', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'reading', 'sorts', 'negative', 'reviews', 'admit', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'Grudge', 'father', 'NEITHER', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'scary', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'success', 'watching', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'two', 'months', 'later', 'late', 'night', 'REALLY', 'began', 'see', 'how', 'frightening', 'movie', 'Probably', 'same', 'amount', 'fear', 'original', 'Exorcist', 'movie', 'really', 'effectively', 'well', 'done', 'HAVE', 'watch', 'Exorcist', 'Grudge', 'night', 'get', 'proper', 'effect.The', 'Grudge', 'benefits', 'greatly', 'when', 'maintaining', 'moody', 'atmosphere', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'story', 'say', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'best', 'easiest', 'understand', 'Just', 'interesting', 'enough', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Grudge', 'also', 'benefits', 'when', 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'fact', 'probably', 'strongest', 'point.Every', 'time', 'something', 'scary', 'happens', 'see', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'scary', 'monster', 'boy', 'kind', 'strange', 'shadow', 'effect', '*very*', 'important', 'want', 'effectively', 'scare', 'someone', 'scary', 'boy', 'had', 'appeared', 'screen', 'longer', 'few', 'seconds', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'scared', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'used', 'seeing', 'boy', 'then', 'gone', 'Not', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'REALLY', 'movie', 'see', 'really', 'scare', 'simply', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'put', 'scary', 'monster', 'screen', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'HAVE', 'create', 'moody', 'atmosphere', 'make', 'film', 'believable', 'Grudge', '*extremely*', 'well', 'area.The', 'fact', 'something', 'scary', 'almost', 'always', 'unexpectedly', 'Grudge', 'give', 'film', 'compliment', ""'m"", 'telling', 'scene', 'woman', 'building', 'herself', 'well', 'security', 'guard', 'having', 'travel', 'home', 'apartment', 'building', '10', 'minutes', 'total', 'bone-chilling', 'excitement', '*loved*', 'scene.I', 'was', 'totally', 'edge', 'seat', 'wondering', 'when', 'woman', 'was', 'finally', 'going', 'have', 'something', 'bad', 'happen', 'scene', 'where', 'woman', 'saw', 'darkness', 'coming', 'walking', 'down', 'stairs', 'having', 'hurry', 'up', 'get', 'was', '*awesome*', 'scene', 'few', 'moments', 'happened', 'where', 'DID', 'see', 'something', 'shadow', 'was', 'ANOTHER', 'awesome', 'display', 'bone-chilling', 'brilliance', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Freakin', 'AWESOME', 'Excellent', 'pacing', 'suspense', 'Grudge', 'true', 'horror', 'classic', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousand', 'horror', 'movies', 'time', ""'d"", 'easily', 'put', 'Grudge', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'one', 'best.People', 'today', 'have', 'drastically', 'different', 'opinions', 'when', 'what', 'movie', 'scary', 'Remember', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'everyone', 'could', 'agree', 'Exorcist', 'was', 'scariest', 'movie', 'all-time', 'wish', 'everyone', 'agreed', 'Grudge', 'total', 'classic', 'Ring', 'excellent', 'one']",N/A

Eshbach ""Ben Eshbach""","[6, 9]","This is a movie about two little ghosts who burp at you until you kill yourself or fall into a coma or lose your jaw so that your tongue hangs down like a necktie.Little Brother ghost and Little Sister ghost (actually Mommy Ghost but who cares?) are the victims of a murder-suicide. This fact is obscured by the much more pungent fact that they are victims of Genre. The director's insulated obsession with horror films has him forcing the Sibling Spooks to burp their way across town, up elevator shafts, down stairwells, through cell phones and even once in the window reflection of a public transit vehicle.Their bad manners are not the only shenanigans the poor devils are forced to perform. They are both made to alternate between ""hiding under the bed"" and ""hiding in the attic"" - both being locations in which their prey never fail to fatally discover them. They are forced to wear large amounts of eyeliner and white foundation which they must remove and reapply instantly - and Spooky Sis is required to keep her hair carefully covering her face and to move with jerky motions in order to imitate the director's favorite spook from a different movie - The Ring.Even though Sis can turn herself into smoke she is still forced to crawl downstairs - because... well because crawling is spookier than walking. I guess. Also, they both have a thing for ""opening their eyes *suddenly*."" Sis is also known for manipulating the electric circuitry of an apartment surveillance camera. Their only handicap - like a cat forced to wear a bell around its neck our two mini-spooks are required to gastro-intestinally announce their approach upon their victims. This gives the victims time to be ""horrified"" before their jaw falls off or they go catatonic.The director's task was to take this entire situation and make it scary - no easy feat considering how goofy it is. The Genre Beast forces our director to replace substance with style: film coloring, ""spooky"" soundtrack music, a pseudo-intellectual achronological sequence and stupid flat characters who walk backwards into haunted rooms.Being an American remake DVD release allows fans to say things like ""It wasn't as good as Ju-on!"" or ""Wait until the unedited directors cut comes out!"" and other booby-prize slogans (which, incidentally, obtain their purchase by referencing the same external  environment upon which this review is based and for which this review will be criticized.)

The ghosts are not over-used, Ms. Gellar's role is small, but important, and Ms. Tamblyn's character fits in perfectly.

How many times do we have to watch a girl in a dark creepy house hear a frightening noise, investigate it, see a ghost and then continue to wander around the house as if nothing happens? Not scary. How many times do we have to hear a character over explain what is happening as if we weren't paying attention to the movie ourselves?  Not scary. How many times do we have sit through a scene of sudden loud noises meant to scare us?  Not scary.  How many times do we have to watch a ghost chase down its victim only to find that when the victim turns around the ghost is gone?  Not scary. Not suspenseful.  Not original.The only interesting scenes in Grudge 2 are the opening sequence and the closing sequence. The ghost in the sweatshirt scene was pretty original. Outside of that, there are little to no scares, no suspense and nothing original.  The only disorienting aspect of this movie was the story being told out of order and what was the point of the dying mom in the bed? Yikes!

Thankfully, Sam Raimi had enough sense to bring back series creator Takashi Shimizu to direct, resulting in a film that is just as frightening as the original. Karen is assigned to a new caregiving position in a house that bears a terrible curse, which unleashes a pair of restless spirits upon anyone who enters. THE GRUDGE is nearly identical to JU-ON in nearly every, so why remake it at all? The answer is simple: most Americans are lazy and uncaring when it comes to foreign films, and this was the only way to expose this terrifying curse to a larger world audience. Faulting it on this, alone, would be an unfair assessment entirely, escpecially when it gets so much right. Shimizu brings back the same sense of dread and horrifying images from before, and manages to to create old-fashioned scares built on heart-pounding suspense. He overcomes the PG-13 rating without resorting to blood or gore, using the subtly subdued score and unnerving appearances of his pale-faced ghosts to drive home the terror. The American casting works fine, and launched Sarah Michelle Gellar from a television actress into movie stardom. But really, the strength of the film lies in the performance by returning actress Takako Fuji as the malevolent spirit Kayako. Her twisted movements and gut-wrenching stares chill to the bone.

Crockett ""Domino713""","[2, 5]","While I admire the first film's attempt to bring Japanese horror stories to mainstream America, this convoluted sequel was nothing short of confusing and unsatisfying.Quick Synopsis: After her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is hospitalized in Tokyo after attempting to burn down a house she believed was cursed, Aubrey (Amber Tamblyn) makes the journey to Japan to try to find out what happened and bring her sister home. Aubrey's tale turns tragic shortly after her arrival, and she frantically tries to discover the secret to stopping the evil grudge.The film is intercut between sequences of Aubrey in Tokyo, and a family in Chicago who are also stalked by the deadly grudge, and who seemingly have nothing to do with the events taking place in Japan (they sort of try to explain things at the very end of the film...but not enough. The audience is still left scratching their heads and saying ""..huh?"")Confusing is the word for this film. The plot makes very little sense, and the parts of it they do attempt to explain are done very poorly and the viewer is left with way more questions than answers. In general the pace of the film was very slow, and I found myself growing bored at times. It has a few good special effects, but the scare tactics are predictable, and the movie pretty much repeats the same ones over and over. The ending is meant to give some sense of understanding as to the origins of the grudge (aside from the basics we learn from the first movie), and at the very least it explains why the japanese woman/little boy make those weird noises right before they kill someone. Unfortunately, thats about it, and I have a feeling most people will be supremely disappointed in this sequel.The editing is sloppy, and there's an entire storyline that follows a small pack of school girls who entered the house on a dare and ended up becoming victims of the grudge. These girls were obviously meant to be used as expendable people that could be killed off for entertainment while Amber Tamblyn's character followed her quest for the truth.Bottom line, it was a disappointing and *confusing* film (the ending was kind of awful too), and it grossly under-used Sarah Michelle Gellar. I'm not sure her presence could have saved this terrible script, but it might have made it a little more tolerable.",2,Fans Might Carry a Grudge Against this Sequel...,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,2320,"['admire', 'first', 'film', 'attempt', 'bring', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'stories', 'mainstream', 'America', 'convoluted', 'sequel', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'confusing', 'unsatisfying.Quick', 'Synopsis', 'sister', 'Karen', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'hospitalized', 'Tokyo', 'attempting', 'burn', 'down', 'house', 'believed', 'was', 'cursed', 'Aubrey', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'journey', 'Japan', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'bring', 'sister', 'home', 'Aubrey', 'tale', 'tragic', 'shortly', 'arrival', 'frantically', 'discover', 'secret', 'stopping', 'evil', 'grudge.The', 'film', 'intercut', 'sequences', 'Aubrey', 'Tokyo', 'family', 'Chicago', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'stalked', 'deadly', 'grudge', 'who', 'seemingly', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'Japan', 'sort', 'try', 'explain', 'things', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'enough', 'audience', 'still', 'left', 'scratching', 'heads', 'saying', '..huh', 'Confusing', 'word', 'film', 'plot', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'parts', 'do', 'attempt', 'explain', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'poorly', 'viewer', 'left', 'way', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'general', 'pace', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'found', 'growing', 'bored', 'times', 'few', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'scare', 'tactics', 'are', 'predictable', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'ones', 'over', 'ending', 'meant', 'give', 'sense', 'understanding', 'origins', 'grudge', 'aside', 'basics', 'learn', 'first', 'movie', 'very', 'least', 'why', 'japanese', 'woman/little', 'boy', 'make', 'weird', 'noises', 'right', 'kill', 'someone', 'Unfortunately', 'thats', 'have', 'feeling', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'supremely', 'disappointed', 'sequel.The', 'editing', 'sloppy', 'entire', 'storyline', 'small', 'pack', 'school', 'girls', 'who', 'entered', 'house', 'dare', 'ended', 'up', 'becoming', 'victims', 'grudge', 'girls', 'were', 'obviously', 'meant', 'be', 'used', 'expendable', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'entertainment', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'character', 'followed', 'quest', 'truth.Bottom', 'line', 'was', 'disappointing', '*confusing*', 'film', 'ending', 'was', 'kind', 'awful', 'too', 'grossly', 'under-used', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'presence', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'terrible', 'script', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'tolerable']",N/A

What they do not know is that the house is inhabited by two very angry ghosts, Kayako [Takako Fuji] and her son, Toshio [Yuya Ozeki], who are bent on spreading a curse to all who come in contact with them. When caregiver Karen Davis [Sarah Michelle Gellar] comes to care for the ailing Emma, the curse spreads beyond the house, rippling through the city in waves of rage and death.The film is almost a literal translation of the very fine original, Ju-on, and that makes it quite a disappointment. No new dimensions are added, even with the twist of bringing American characters into Japanese culture. With such a close remake, even using some of the same actors, it is clear that director Takashi Shimuzi was happy enough with his first attempt, and the reason for making an Americanized version a mystery (not really, it is mostly likely financial reasons, but what a poor reason to make art).",3,A remake that didn't need to be made,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,1096,"['American', 'couple', 'Matthew', '[', 'William', 'Mapother', ']', 'Jennifer', '[', 'Clea', 'DuVall', ']', 'living', 'Japan', 'move', 'perfect', 'little', 'house', 'mother', 'Emma', '[', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie', ']', 'who', 'care', 'due', 'dementia', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'house', 'inhabited', 'two', 'very', 'angry', 'ghosts', 'Kayako', '[', 'Takako', 'Fuji', ']', 'son', 'Toshio', '[', 'Yuya', 'Ozeki', ']', 'who', 'are', 'bent', 'spreading', 'curse', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'When', 'caregiver', 'Karen', 'Davis', '[', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', ']', 'care', 'ailing', 'Emma', 'curse', 'house', 'rippling', 'city', 'waves', 'rage', 'death.The', 'film', 'almost', 'literal', 'translation', 'very', 'fine', 'original', 'Ju-on', 'quite', 'disappointment', 'new', 'dimensions', 'are', 'added', 'even', 'twist', 'bringing', 'American', 'characters', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'close', 'remake', 'even', 'using', 'same', 'actors', 'clear', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Shimuzi', 'was', 'happy', 'enough', 'first', 'attempt', 'reason', 'making', 'Americanized', 'version', 'mystery', 'not', 'really', 'mostly', 'likely', 'financial', 'reasons', 'what', 'poor', 'reason', 'make', 'art']",N/A

There have been a whole slew of PG-13 horror movies released in the past few years that have mild scares and one soul purpose... get teenagers money (who are the majority of the movie business' revenue).Stop giving kids allowances parents. Maybe we'll get better movies.Yet, funny thing, I actually enjoyed THE GRUDGE 2. Was it a terrifying movie? No. It had some good moments and some freaky moments, but honestly, how scary can a grey kid sitting in a corner who shreaks like a cat be? So, why did I enjoy THE GRUDGE 2 when it's predecessor was such a run of the mill bore?Lots of reasons, but the main reason was that Sam Raimi chose to be a producer on the film again. Raimi has had the magic touch on great movies throughout his career: the Evil Dead series, Spiderman series, Darkman, The Gift and A Simple Plan. Knowing that he returned for GRUDGE 2, tells me that it will be at least better than the first, and it was.Secondly, the addition of AMBER TAMBLYN who plays Aubrey Davis, who comes to bring her estranged sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar from the original) home. Amber has a lot of promise as an actress and she brings emotion and depth to THE GRUDGE 2. She struggles with her identity, her regrets and her fear of facing lifes challenges.Finally, the movie is much more complex, probing into the source of the evil that surrounds the HOUSE, or is the house? Why has the spreading evil grown worse? The movie explores numerous characters in different places and times and how the Grudge has touched them all.Amber Tamblyn, Arielle Kebbel, Teresa Palmer, Jenna Dewan, Matthew Knight & Jennifer Beals all bring new life to a series that seemed as doomed as its characters.The GRUDGE 2 is a good movie. Don't be put off by negative reviews. If you enjoyed the first, you'll love the second. I thought the first was boring, but was a big Gellar-Buffy fan. The second is a breath of fresh air.

872531,A2KGCK3Q4VARC8,B0006SGYL0,Christopher Greffin,"[2, 2]","The Grudge, based on a Japanese horror film, involves a haunted house that seems to destroy everything it touches and the lives of Americans living in Japan. It's off to a bad start from the begining when it fails to explain how these characters came about to living in Japan and just gives them titles like exchange student and Professor. I happen to know for a fact that Japan is one of the homogenous countries in the world, which is just a way of saying very few non-Japanese people live there. Also the Japanese characters, seemingly few for a movie set in Japan, all talk in perfect english. Well people don't see this kind of movie for an insight into Japanese culture anyway.Apparently we learn that the haunted house the movie center's around once had a family that was murdered in it (and they fail to tell the American family moving in, yeah right). There's also a professor who in the past had encountered the house and surcomed to his death because of it. Sarah Michelle Geller's character encounters this house, finds it's not an ordinary house, and investigates. Trust me I'm giving nothing away; even if I wanted to it would be impossible for me to explain the major plot points. There are visual sequences that could very well have been effective had the story made any sense what so ever. Simply put this film is one scene after another of a noise, or an image, or a phenoma without the slightest bit of coherence to a plot. It's riddled with inconsistancies and there's a flashback sequence as uncomprehesible as anything else in this film. There's also no character developement, which might be the least of it's problems.Judging by my writing so far I should give it just one star, but I hesitate due to the visual nature. As I said there are scenes that could be effective in a better story. It does have a sense of creepiness, though I really was never scared. I can compare this to The Ring, another visually strong film, but one that was actually going somewhere, and was intrigueing, and yes was actually frieghtening.

But it seems kind of rare for a film to actually be re-created by the original director and have almost shot-for-shot imagery from the original. And so it is with the Grudge, an american production shot in Japan with the original director of Ju-On, where the source comes from. While it seems kind of creepy, it was kind of bad bordering on stale.As we're told in the beginning, if a person dies in the grip of a powerful emotion, then it'll bring a curse on whoever comes near and consume them. So in this case, it's a house, anyone who sets foot in a japanese house is basically haunted by these 2 kids: Toshio, a kid who can screech like a cat which borders on irritating than scary and Kayako, a teenage girl who has this weird vocal thing going on.The story is told very non-linear(chronologically) so we start with the death of a character than go to a character's rendezvous with the curse in the house. Then jump into the past for more people. Then back to present and we actually uncover why the curse started and what drove the first character's death and we also get the end of the present's story at the same time.As for the ""scares"", they're not really that scary. The best scares always comes when it seems like there's nothing on screen then there is. A lot of these you can actually pinpoint before they happen like the attic scare or the under the covers ones. But in a scene that almost seems straight out of the Ring, one of the girls appears in a surveillance video seemingly coming out of the ground.

872536,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B0006SGYL0,C. Middleton,"[2, 4]","Hollywood, in the last few years, has discovered the Japanese flair for horror films. ""The Grudge"", however, is the first collaboration between American producers and Japanese producers, using famed Japanese director, Takashi Shimizu's original film of the same name, in an effort to make popular the Japanese horror film for the western audience, without losing its critical edge in the translation. Tinsel town's adaptation of ""The Ring"", for example, in some respects was successful, though managed to lose something in the translation. ""The Grudge"", though, remained on task, maintaining that quintessential Japanese horror atmosphere, non-linear narrative style and open ending. More importantly, ""The Grudge"" is a chilling tale - a ghost story with an edge.Revenge is the underlying theme of this film, and the story is actually taken from Japanese folklore. As the legend goes, a king loses a chess game to an underling. The king not only kills the winning underling, but also kills his entire family. As the family have been murdered unjustly, their rage develops and a curse is born. Their spirits are held in place with emotional rage, a grudge, and they inflict this rage on the living. In the film, there has been a murder suicide in a house, and all those that come into contact with the house, become the victims of these vengeful spirits. This may appear to be a standard plot idea for a ghost story, but it is the way that Shimizu tells the story that makes it interesting. The film seamlessly moves backwards and forward in time, telling us the story in fragments, until the entire plot comes together at the climax. For me this had great effect, as this method maintained my attention from start to finish - a welcome diversion from standard linear story telling.Sarah Michelle Geller as Kare Davis put in a believable performance as the young American caretaker. She can appear realistically horrified without it seeming tacky or melodramatic.Overall a good horror film that had me riveted from the start to its over the top finale.",4,A Ghost Story with an Edge,1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,2051,"['Hollywood', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'discovered', 'Japanese', 'flair', 'horror', 'films', 'Grudge', 'however', 'first', 'collaboration', 'American', 'producers', 'Japanese', 'producers', 'using', 'famed', 'Japanese', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'original', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'effort', 'make', 'popular', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'western', 'audience', 'losing', 'critical', 'edge', 'translation', 'Tinsel', 'town', 'adaptation', 'Ring', 'example', 'respects', 'was', 'successful', 'though', 'managed', 'lose', 'something', 'translation', 'Grudge', 'remained', 'task', 'maintaining', 'quintessential', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'atmosphere', 'non-linear', 'narrative', 'style', 'open', 'ending', 'More', 'importantly', 'Grudge', 'chilling', 'tale', 'ghost', 'story', 'edge.Revenge', 'underlying', 'theme', 'film', 'story', 'actually', 'taken', 'Japanese', 'folklore', 'legend', 'king', 'chess', 'game', 'underling', 'king', 'not', 'only', 'winning', 'underling', 'also', 'entire', 'family', 'family', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'unjustly', 'rage', 'curse', 'born', 'spirits', 'are', 'held', 'place', 'emotional', 'rage', 'grudge', 'inflict', 'rage', 'living', 'film', 'been', 'murder', 'suicide', 'house', 'come', 'contact', 'house', 'become', 'victims', 'vengeful', 'spirits', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'standard', 'plot', 'idea', 'ghost', 'story', 'way', 'Shimizu', 'story', 'interesting', 'film', 'seamlessly', 'backwards', 'forward', 'time', 'telling', 'story', 'fragments', 'entire', 'plot', 'together', 'climax', 'had', 'great', 'effect', 'method', 'maintained', 'attention', 'start', 'finish', 'welcome', 'diversion', 'standard', 'linear', 'story', 'telling.Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Geller', 'Kare', 'Davis', 'put', 'believable', 'performance', 'young', 'American', 'caretaker', 'can', 'appear', 'realistically', 'horrified', 'seeming', 'tacky', 'melodramatic.Overall', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'had', 'riveted', 'start', 'top', 'finale']",N/A
872537,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0006SGYL0,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[4, 4]","If I learned anything from watching The Grudge (2004) last night its that malevolent spirits are very messy, and don't pick up after themselves.  Perhaps that's part of their modus operandi...they come into your home, create a huge mess, and then while your attention is focused on cleaning up the place, that's when they choose to scare the heebie jeebies out of you.  Well, few things, cinematically speaking, scare the heebie jeebies out of me anymore (real life is infinitely more frightening), but I did think this film was, at the very least, entertaining, and provided some spooky visuals and an interesting and fairly simple story.  Co-written and directed by Takashi Shimizu, The Grudge is actually a remake of a Japanese film he did previously titled Ju-on: The Grudge (2003), which I have not seen, so I can't comment or compare without sounding foolish.  Appearing in the film is Sarah Michelle Gellar (I Know What You Did Last Summer)...does anyone else find it slightly pretentious to consistently use all three names?  But I digress...also appearing is Jason Behr (""Dawson's Creek""), William Mapother (Lords of Dogtown), Clea DuVall (Identity), KaDee Strickland (Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid), Grace Zabriskie (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me), Ted Raimi (Man with the Screaming Brain), Ryo Ishibashi (Dog Star), and Bill Pullman, the guy who played the President of the United States in Roland Emmerich's bloated and flawed science fiction orgasmofest masterpiece Independence Day (1996)...I rip on Emmerich because I think he's one of the worst kinds of filmmakers (load the movie with costly special effects to hide the fact its lacking in everything else, including an actual story) but in a purely visual sense his films can be fun...The film begins with some text telling us that when a really angry person bites during a fit of unprecedented rage, the negative energies stick around, creating some wickedly awesome bad mojo that waits to glom onto unsuspecting individuals who happen to visit the area, thus consuming their juicy and effervescent life force.  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen Davis, an exchange student living in Japan with her boyfriend Doug (Behr) who's quite the hunk with his perfectly tousled hair...you know the style, it's the one that someone spends two hours and a whole lot of money at the hairdressers for to get that `just woke up' look (I get it every morning for free)...anyway, Karen, who's a nurse of sorts, receives an assignment to provide daytime care for a really creepy infirmed elderly woman (Zabriskie) after the mysterious disappearance of the previous caregiver named Yoko...alas, poor Yoko, I knew her not, Horatio, but she was a pretty, young, hello kitty maiden...anyway, Karen arrives at the house, sensing something odd, but goes about performing her chores.  Turns out the crazy lady lives with her son (Mapother) and his wife (DuVall), neither of whom return home, prompting Karen to call her boss (Raimi) as she doesn't want to leave the goony old bat alone...but guess what?  They're not alone...at least not in that house, as it has a violent history, and something was left behind, something in the form of a small, nekkid Japanese boy with a whole lot of eyeliner...and a big mouth...(the evil takes on many forms, but this was the oddest)First of all, does anyone else think William Mapother is kinda creepy?  I'm not talking about his character, but the man himself...his face is all scrunched up and too small for his head, reminding me of one of those angry midgets from the Phantasm movies...well, I suppose I'm no Adonis myself, and he's probably a very kind fellow...as I said before, I enjoyed this film.  It sort of reminded me of a Japanese version of The Amityville Horror, but, instead of Satan moving in and causing all sorts of mischief, we have a nondescript evil entity, the result of a past incident of great anger and violence (the Japanese detective referred to it an `emotional stain'), indiscriminately preying on unsuspecting visitors who happen to enter the abode.  I might be tempted to label this a haunted house story, but that's not entirely true as the malevolent force wasn't confined to the house, but rather latched on to individuals who spent time within the four walls, and subsequently followed them wherever they went until...well, let's just say following them around was by far the least harmful thing it would do...the story was actually pretty simple, but told in a way to make it appear more complicated.  What I mean is instead of proceeding on a linear path, the film is edited in such a way that we see past sequences mixed in with scenes of the present, as they story crosses timeline boundaries, weaving three, connected tales into one.  This kind of thing can get messed up very easily, but here they kept it clean, orderly, and understandable.  The main one involves Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, the second involves the family currently residing in the house, and the third features the family that lived in the house three years past, and the ones responsible for all the stuff going on presently.  Oddly, there seemed to be less focus on the characters and more on the story itself, which may be a result of cultural differences, I'm not sure, but it felt intentional, so I went with it...there are some good scares throughout the film, many the result of something seemingly innocuous in the background coming forth to surprise an unsuspecting audience, along with a few, drawn out sequences designed to create a sense of suspense.  The overall effect for me was a permeating sense of unease, as the evil was clinging to the characters, biding its time.  Overall I thought the cinematography was really beautiful, and I especially liked those long and foreboding shots, as they developed a real sense of tension.  If you're looking for some visceral thrills, you'll probably be disappointed as the blood n' guts factor is minimal, but in terms of a spooky ghost story, the film does very well.  I have only seen the PG-13 version, but there is an R rated directors cut available on DVD, one that features about six or seven minutes of extra footage.The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic high definition, looks very sharp and clean and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through very well.  The PG-13 version that I have has a commentary track with producer Sam Raimi, screenwriter Stephen Susco, actors Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ted Raimi, KaDee Strickland, and Jason Behr, along with a couple of others.  It also features a five part, `making of' documentary titled `A Powerful Rage', a featurette titled `Under the Skin' - A medical explanation of fear response in film, along with trailers, one for this film, along with The Forgotten (2004), Guess Who (2005), Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid (2004), Boogeyman (2005), Riding Giants (2004), Spider-Man 2 (2004), Man of the House (2005), and Mirrormask (2005).  The Director's Cut DVD contains a few more extras, so if you are planning on buying this film, keep an eye on which version you're getting, depending on what you're looking for...Cookieman108By the way, did anyone notice how I got through this entire review without mentioning The Ring (2002)?",4,"""The whole time I was in that house I felt something was wrong.

Just the expectation of what to come in the movie seems to be the most creepy thing in the entire movie.I agree with others when they say this is like The Ring as you can really tell both movies came from the same area (as they both are remakes of Japanese movies). The ""ghosts"" in both movies are eerily similar.  However, I enjoyed this movie more than The Ring.  There just seemed to be more scary parts than in the Ring.  This movie does keep you jumping and holding the blanket over your chin.The movie is based on the thought that when a person dies a violent death, their spirit hangs around, spawning a sort of curse.  It has a good plot and stays with it throughout the entire movie instead of jumping around.Rent it to test it out or buy it as a good addition to your horror movie collection.

872540,A3HN4OZBYVDTU6,B0006SGYL0,"Crypt ""thecrypt777""","[5, 6]","Ok, so it's obvious that this flick wouldn't recieve nominations, but let's face it; this is a great horror film. While most American horror for the last 10 years or so has gone for a cheap pseudo comical approach with actors delivering pointless and stupid one-liners, or the action/horror approach with leather clad babes toting ridiculously huge guns, this film (directed by a Japanese) leaves out all of what makes modern American horror films worthless and trite and injects it with some nightmarishly grotesque images and utter creepiness. Finally a movie that grasps what it means to be a HORROR movie. It's probably the scariest mainstream film I've seen in a very long time. Much better than The Ring. That movie left me bitterly disappointed and feeling like I was cheated. For all it's hype, I found the Ring to be downright lame. In The Grudge there is a certain element of ambiguity which might confuse some viewers. One thing that came to mind is why does the ghost of the young boy screech like a cat? The only clue is that we see his cat drowned in the bath tub along with him. It's just something to chew on, and it gives the film a definite surreal element.

If it failed at the box office she could be faced with the prospect of more Scooby Doo sequels while its success could lead to bigger and better things. After all, it was her first serious film role after six years on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and proof that she could carry a movie on her name alone. Gellar is smart. She doesn't stray from the genre that made her a star. The financial success of The Grudge surpassed expectations that the studio had for it and a sequel is already in the works.There is a spirited audio commentary by Sam and Ted Raimi, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rob Tapert, Clea DuVall, Stephen Susco, Jason Behr and KaDee Strickland. Tapert MCs the proceedings, often prompting the participants with questions. Everybody recounts production anecdotes, including working in Japan, getting used to their customs and working with Shimizu.""A Powerful Rage: Behind The Grudge"" examines several aspects of the movie and can be viewed in five separate featurettes or altogether. Unlike the original, which used actual locations, the house in this new version existed entirely on a set. The cast also talk about Shimizu's distinctive vision and his working methods.Finally, ""Under the Skin"" features Dr. Joseph LeDoux, a professor of neural science and psychology.

Yeah, I myself probably would have enjoyed a storybook ending, but I was indeed surprised by this one.I think the movie has some of the best visuals for a horror flick in quite some time.  I also think that this is the major goal of the director - make them remember the scene and that the scene was shocking to them.  I think that happens quite a bit in this film.

872545,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0006SGYL0,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","Unlike The Grudge, which I found to be a total dud of a horror movie, The Grudge 2 actually has its creepier moments.  In my opinion, this sequel is vastly superior to the original, so I'm a little perplexed as to why it has gotten such bad reviews.  Like the original, it tells its story in a nonsequential manner.  That's not as big a problem this time around, as you know to expect it, but I was a little frustrated by the fact that one big story arc seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the movie until the very end.  Of course, what matters here, even more than the story, is the scare factor, and The Grudge 2 greatly ratchets up the creepiness and atmosphere to satisfying levels, and it does so from the very start.The story picks up immediately after the events chronicled in The Grudge, as Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn of Joan of Arcadia fame) is dispatched to Japan to bring her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) home.  Gellar turns in a memorable cameo appearance, but the Grudge mantle is quickly placed solely around the neck of Tamblyn as she tries to figure out what happened to her sister.  With no one but an interested journalist (Edison Chen) to help her, she eventually succeeds in learning much more than is healthy about ""the house"" and the curse associated with it.  At the same ""time"" (remember, this is ""Grudge time""), you have three young girls who make the mistake of visiting the ghost house; it's basically a prank by two cool girls to scare new girl Allison (Arielle Kebbel) - scare her they do, but let's just say this prank really, really backfires.  It makes for a great, really creepy opening to the film and supplies some great moments the rest of the way.  Then you have yet another story arc playing out that has the creepy little Japanese boy doing double duty in a Chicago apartment building.  Following the arrival of a mystery guest next door, things take a very bad turn for the family of a little boy who is just far too curious for his own good.  I didn't really care for this storyline, as it just seemed to interrupt all the good creepy stuff going on in Japan, the changes in family behavior happen far too drastically, and, most importantly, it's hard to put this aspect of the plot into context until the very end.When I reviewed The Grudge, I said it would only be scary if you think hair and kids wearing mascara are scary.  The Grudge 2 isn't what I would call scary, either, but it does deliver a number of really creepy moments.  Gellar makes a most memorable exit from the story, Allison's experience in the ""closet"" may have you gripping the arms of your chair, and Aubrey makes for a most sympathetic character.  Tamblyn doesn't have the screen presence of a Sarah Michelle Gellar, but the all-too-brief appearance of Jenna Dewan (the hottest woman on planet Earth) is enough to make you forget Gellar altogether.  If you weren't impressed with the first film, you should definitely give this sequel a try.",4,Much creepier and more atmospheric than The Grudge,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,2986,"['Grudge', 'found', 'be', 'total', 'dud', 'horror', 'movie', 'Grudge', '2', 'actually', 'creepier', 'moments', 'opinion', 'sequel', 'vastly', 'superior', 'original', ""'m"", 'little', 'perplexed', 'why', 'gotten', 'such', 'bad', 'reviews', 'original', 'story', 'nonsequential', 'manner', 'not', 'as', 'big', 'problem', 'time', 'around', 'know', 'expect', 'was', 'little', 'frustrated', 'fact', 'one', 'big', 'story', 'arc', 'seemed', 'have', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'rest', 'movie', 'very', 'end', 'course', 'what', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'story', 'scare', 'factor', 'Grudge', '2', 'greatly', 'up', 'creepiness', 'atmosphere', 'satisfying', 'levels', 'so', 'very', 'start.The', 'story', 'up', 'immediately', 'events', 'chronicled', 'Grudge', 'Aubrey', 'Davis', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'fame', 'dispatched', 'Japan', 'bring', 'sister', 'Karen', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'home', 'Gellar', 'turns', 'memorable', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Grudge', 'mantle', 'quickly', 'placed', 'solely', 'neck', 'Tamblyn', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'sister', 'one', 'interested', 'journalist', 'Edison', 'Chen', 'help', 'eventually', 'learning', 'much', 'more', 'healthy', 'house', 'curse', 'associated', 'same', 'time', 'remember', 'Grudge', 'time', 'have', 'three', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'make', 'mistake', 'visiting', 'ghost', 'house', 'basically', 'prank', 'two', 'cool', 'girls', 'scare', 'new', 'girl', 'Allison', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'scare', 'do', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'prank', 'really', 'really', 'great', 'really', 'creepy', 'opening', 'film', 'supplies', 'great', 'moments', 'rest', 'way', 'Then', 'have', 'yet', 'story', 'arc', 'playing', 'out', 'creepy', 'little', 'Japanese', 'boy', 'doing', 'double', 'duty', 'Chicago', 'apartment', 'building', 'Following', 'arrival', 'mystery', 'guest', 'next', 'door', 'things', 'take', 'very', 'bad', 'turn', 'family', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'curious', 'own', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'storyline', 'just', 'seemed', 'interrupt', 'good', 'creepy', 'stuff', 'going', 'Japan', 'changes', 'family', 'behavior', 'happen', 'far', 'too', 'drastically', 'most', 'importantly', 'hard', 'put', 'aspect', 'plot', 'context', 'very', 'end.When', 'reviewed', 'Grudge', 'said', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'scary', 'think', 'hair', 'kids', 'wearing', 'mascara', 'are', 'scary', 'Grudge', '2', ""n't"", 'what', 'would', 'call', 'scary', 'either', 'deliver', 'number', 'really', 'creepy', 'moments', 'Gellar', 'most', 'memorable', 'exit', 'story', 'Allison', 'experience', 'closet', 'may', 'have', 'gripping', 'arms', 'chair', 'Aubrey', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Tamblyn', ""n't"", 'have', 'screen', 'presence', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'all-too-brief', 'appearance', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'hottest', 'woman', 'planet', 'Earth', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'Gellar', 'altogether', 'were', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'first', 'film', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'sequel', 'try']",N/A

It wants some face-time. It wants to get a place on your lunch calendar, maybe talk about better digs than the attic, certainly get a generous raise in its CGI allowance, that sort of thing. But give the American ghost a little quality time---you know, try to figure out why the damned thing shows up at 3 am in the upper servant's belfry flapping its be-sheeted arms and clanking around in its moldering leg-irons---and you're gonna be OK with the American ghost.The Japanese ghost---that's another story. The Japanese ghost is mad as hell and it's not gonna take it anymore. It takes no prisoners. It doesn't even have time for CGI, or sheets, or even chains: that would just get in the way of its main order of business, which is twofold:#1)unleashing ghost jihad on you; and#2) ruining your [expletive].In that order. Rinse, repeat. Sometimes the Japanese ghost gets so busy doing #2 that it doesn't have time for #1, & vice versa.Rest assured, though, that unlike the American ghost, there is no negotiating, no ceasefire, no white flags, no peace talks, with the Japanese ghost. Ever. It will not be satisfied until you are:a)fruitbat crazy insane in some institution with flickery lighting and lots of shadowy corners, where the Japanese ghost can show up at opportune moments to pay its respects;b) dead in the most unpleasant way possible, including looking, post-necrosis, like you died taking a dump your Depends;c)driven to take your life in some impressive fashion, like eating a blowtorch or gumming your lips and nostrils together with Krazy Glue.d) all of the aboveThat's pretty much ""The Grudge 2"", which will work for you to the extent you're willing to kick back, take a load off, have a swig of piping hot sake, and relax about minor things like plot & acting.""The Grudge 2""---which is an American remake of the, um, original sequel, only the whole rationale for the remake eludes me, since the movie is shot by its original director Takashi Shimizu, takes place in Japan, and features a Japanese Ghost. Actually, it features a passle of 'em. But whatever: it's Exhibit A of the phenomenon we were just discussing, Nasty Japanese Ghost Syndrome.Here's the plot, summed up, in a nutshell: this trio of plummy schoolgirls, on a dare, walks up to the house from Grudge 1, now all sooty-black from the fire, curled up on its haunches in some Tokyo backstreet, and the Thing looks damned Hungry.Director Takashi Shimizu is a master when it comes to setting up shots of smoldering, quiet malevolence, and here the House practically breathes menace: ""Feed Me"".So it's a haunted house flick. I mean, in the real sense of the word. a haunted house that sorta takes the whole ""think global, act local"", and turns it on its head. It exports. It mass markets. It's a consumer business with international shipping, baby!I could bore you with plot---which jumps around through time and, whatever anyone else says, is perfectly easy to follow, unless you're a moron. Whatever: it's godawful scary. It's scary in a deep, dark, pungent, nasty atavistic way. What do I mean by that?Let's step back. This movie requires a few ingredients: 1) watch it alone 2) in a dark house, maybe with the faucet, somewhere, drip drip dripping 3) after you watch it, you tuck yourself in for the night.And then the film's deep, irrational, crazy nuggets of terror will come back to tuck you in, with big, warty, water-soaked clammy hands. To give you a little goodnight kiss. To ruin your sleep.Why? Because the Japanese Ghost does everything you don't want a ghost to *every* do, especially if it's late at night, and there are dubious sounds out there. Think of it: you don't want the ghost to show up anywhere near your bed: the Grudge spook shows up under the covers. Under your desk. On *top* of your desk when you're hiding in the little cubbyhole, enabling you to get a good feel of its graveyard-cold ankle.So that's it: ""Grudge2"" plays out like a demo-reel of all the most godawful shark-eye black widow venom hornet sting nasty scariness you can imagine, and it will work if you just lay back and let the spooky, creepy crawly malevolence just roll over you.Creepy & deliciously menacing, Grudge 2 is well worth checking out in the dark, and brings an entirely new meaning to the phrase ""House Hunting"".JSG",5,Feed Me,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,4554,"[""'m"",

It scares you when you are supposed to get scared.  There are moments when you are sitting at the edge of your seat, there are things that will send a chill up your spine, and the interesting mixtures and conflicts between American and Japanese cultures add to the enticing flavor of this film.  It was intentionally arranged by American producers that this movie be directed by the same Japanese director who did the original flick on which this American remake was based.  It was an experiment that worked quite well. And of course, I absolutely love Sarah Michelle Gellar in anything she does!

Knouse,"[2, 2]","First off, I have to admit to having seen the Japanese version of this film, ""Ju-On,"" and comparatively speaking, this Americanized version is similar in many ways but there was definitely something lost in the translation.  I own ""Ju-On"" because, quite honestly, I haven't seen a movie that creepy in a long time.  While the Japanese version has its flaws and low-budget look, the story is broken up into four parts and therefore the film is much easier to follow.  I know for a fact if I hadn't already seen ""Ju-On"" the ""The Grudge"" would have been more than a little confusing with its non-linear plotting and scenes from the first version that are inexplicably left out of ""The Grudge."".  ""The Grudge"" is less effective than ""Ju-On"" for the simple reason that is has a little too much Hollywood in it.  The ending in ""The Grudge"" is Hollywood Horror slop, while the ending in ""Ju-On"" is more ominous and eerie, as if to say ""this evil cannot be stopped no matter what you do or where you hide.""  However, there were some moments in ""The Grudge"" that were chilling and creepy, regardless.  Remember, I've already seen this story twice going in and I just wanted a comparison between the two films.  I still got chills watching ""The Grudge.""  Most of the great sound-effects from the first film are used again here, but there was an over-use of the score which frequently ruined some otherwise scary scenes reducing them to shock-tactics.  For instance, in ""Ju-On"" a young woman enters a quiet room with no music playing in the film when a cat screeches suddenly.  In my head, I was in the room with that character at that moment and I got a thrill without the score giving me notice beforehand.  In ""The Grudge"" the music is used too often at the wrong times to ""enhance"" a scary moment before it even happens and the illusion is weakened.  Another thing about this version that makes little sense is that there certainly seem to be a lot of Americans entering and/or contacting this residence in Tokyo, Japan.  I saw more caucasian characters in this film set in Japan than I saw Japanese characters.  It was certainly admirable of Executive Producer Sam Raimi to try and bring ""Ju-On"" to the American masses; and while ""The Grudge"" does succeed now and again at invoking terror, it does not live up to the original film overall.

872556,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B0006SGYL0,DonAthos,"[2, 2]","The Grudge is a horror film remake of a Japanese film. It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar (of BtVS fame) as an American nurse who is charged to watch over a woman in Tokyo. Hijinks ensue, as the house of that woman is home to angry spirits, who track down and kill all those who enter the house. The acting's fine, the direction's fine, etc. Really, the big question that must be asked of a horror film is:Is it scary?Maybe yes and maybe no, depending on what you think of when you think of the word ""scary.""The Grudge is not scary in the sense that Rosemary's Baby or Whatever Happened to Baby Jane were scary. It's not scary in the same way that Psycho, Alien, Halloween or Scream were scary. It's not even scary the same way the Final Destination movies were scary. It's nothing psychological. It's not the ambience. You won't walk away from the movie looking around corners or afraid to turn out the lights. Instead, the movie is scary because the visuals are disturbing and they jump out at you from out of nowhere, with a crash of music.You see, the special effects/make-up team do a great job at creating scary-looking ghosts to terrify Sarah Michelle Gellar, and when they leap out at you with little warning, you'll get a jolt. It's reflexive, kind of like how you'll flinch if something's thrown at your face. But it's hardly the same kind of terror as the true classics of the genre.Real horror isn't *just* things jumping at you, but it's a sense of how and why they're jumping out; the context. In The Grudge, apparently you're a target because you step foot in the wrong home (where bad things, of course, have happened). After that, you're hunted down by the spirits until they... well... we don't actually know *what* they do. We only know that they look scary, and their victims die in some unspecified way. Why are the spirits able to dispatch some victims quite easily while others resist for some period of time? Don't know. Is there any way of fighting back against the spirits? Don't know. Why did the spirits materialize here, specifically, as opposed to all of the other scenes of violent crimes that pepper our lands? Don't know.Basically, the plot has so many holes, because the plot is unimportant to the film, which holds itself as nothing more than a delivery system for those ""jump out at you"" moments. Without a real context, you're only scared when the freaky-looking ghosts are on screen; the terror fades as soon as they're gone. While it's scary in a dark theater, it doesn't hold up once you're back out in the sunshine. A fun flick to see once, perhaps, but not something you'll be discussing in 5 years, or really even 5 weeks.Three stars, because it does what it wants to do and is executed well in terms of production values, acting, etc. It wants the last two stars, however, because it's lightweight and horror of the most fleeting kind.",3,On Thrills and Chills,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,2875,"['Grudge', 'horror', 'film', 'remake', 'Japanese', 'film', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'BtVS', 'fame', 'American', 'nurse', 'who', 'charged', 'watch', 'woman', 'Tokyo', 'Hijinks', 'ensue', 'house', 'woman', 'home', 'angry', 'spirits', 'who', 'track', 'down', 'kill', 'who', 'enter', 'house', 'acting', 'fine', 'direction', 'fine', 'etc', 'Really', 'big', 'question', 'must', 'be', 'asked', 'horror', 'film', 'scary', 'Maybe', 'yes', 'maybe', 'depending', 'what', 'think', 'when', 'think', 'word', 'scary', 'Grudge', 'not', 'scary', 'sense', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Happened', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'were', 'scary', 'not', 'scary', 'same', 'way', 'Psycho', 'Alien', 'Halloween', 'Scream', 'were', 'scary', 'not', 'even', 'scary', 'same', 'way', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'were', 'scary', 'nothing', 'psychological', 'not', 'ambience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'looking', 'corners', 'afraid', 'turn', 'out', 'lights', 'Instead', 'movie', 'scary', 'visuals', 'are', 'disturbing', 'jump', 'out', 'nowhere', 'crash', 'music.You', 'see', 'special', 'effects/make-up', 'team', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'scary-looking', 'ghosts', 'terrify', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'when', 'leap', 'out', 'little', 'warning', ""'ll"", 'get', 'jolt', 'reflexive', 'kind', 'how', ""'ll"", 'flinch', 'something', 'thrown', 'face', 'hardly', 'same', 'kind', 'terror', 'true', 'classics', 'genre.Real', 'horror', ""n't"", '*just*', 'things', 'jumping', 'sense', 'how', 'why', ""'re"", 'jumping', 'out', 'context', 'Grudge', 'apparently', ""'re"", 'target', 'step', 'foot', 'wrong', 'home', 'where', 'bad', 'things', 'course', 'have', 'happened', ""'re"", 'hunted', 'down', 'spirits', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'know', 'do', 'only', 'know', 'look', 'scary', 'victims', 'die', 'unspecified', 'way', 'Why', 'are', 'spirits', 'able', 'dispatch', 'victims', 'quite', 'easily', 'others', 'resist', 'period', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'there', 'way', 'fighting', 'back', 'spirits', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Why', 'did', 'spirits', 'materialize', 'here', 'specifically', 'opposed', 'other', 'scenes', 'violent', 'crimes', 'pepper', 'lands', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know.Basically', 'plot', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'plot', 'unimportant', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'delivery', 'system', 'jump', 'out', 'moments', 'real', 'context', ""'re"", 'only', 'scared', 'when', 'freaky-looking', 'ghosts', 'are', 'screen', 'terror', 'as', 'soon', ""'re"", 'gone', 'scary', 'dark', 'theater', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'once', ""'re"", 'back', 'out', 'sunshine', 'fun', 'flick', 'see', 'once', 'perhaps', 'not', 'something', ""'ll"", 'be', 'discussing', '5', 'years', 'really', 'even', '5', 'weeks.Three', 'stars', 'what', 'do', 'executed', 'well', 'terms', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'etc', 'last', 'two', 'stars', 'however', 'lightweight', 'horror', 'most', 'fleeting', 'kind']",N/A

This film is a break from all special effects movies that Hollywood seems to force upon us. Yes a movie can still be made without them! Was I scared? Sure. The director does take the viewers point of view in mind. I just can't get that scream and little boy creature out of my mind.This horror film takes you back to the old days of filming horror films. No CGI special effects here. Everything you see in the film is real. Okay, I found this out by viewing the bonus features.

It does move along rather slowly, not that movies that aren't face-paced aren't good, they are, but usually they have a better plot and characters involved. The storyline doesn't play out in chronological order, not that it matters.The movie in a nutshell:Bill Pullman jumps to his death in the beginning, reasons unknown as to why. Then the girl Yoko who is the old ladies caretaker comes upon the ghostlike boy and cat and she gets yanked into the attic. So now Sarah Michelle Gellar is a substitute for Yoko because the agency she works for thinks Yoko is sick because they can't get a hold of her. So Sarah goes to the house and does the cleaning routine and she hears a banging/meowing noise so she investigates and finds a taped up wall. She rips it open and there is the boy with his cat again. She leaves because the cat is growling at her and goes back to doing chores. Then the boy is at the top of the stairs and so on. So, Sarah goes back to check on the woman, and she is talking to someone. She goes into her room and sees her staring at something and asks her what and she replies ""I just want her to leave me alone"", then tucks her into bed. She looks up into the corner and sees this black shadow octopus looking thing and she sits in the corner with a look of fear in her face. The police come and investigate and find two corpses which were the married couple, the son of the old woman, and a human jaw. (They both die from the little ghost boy.) In the end it turns out that the little boys mother had a crush on Bill Pullman and he didn't know, and her husband killed her son and her in a jealous rage and then himself, and Bill Pullman came upon them and then he killed himself the next day.What a waste of time.",1,No..,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,1792,"['Are', 'kidding', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'rental', 'move', 'rather', 'slowly', 'not', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'face-paced', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'are', 'usually', 'have', 'better', 'plot', 'characters', 'involved', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'play', 'out', 'chronological', 'order', 'not', 'movie', 'nutshell', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'death', 'beginning', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'why', 'Then', 'girl', 'Yoko', 'who', 'old', 'ladies', 'caretaker', 'ghostlike', 'boy', 'cat', 'yanked', 'attic', 'So', 'now', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'substitute', 'Yoko', 'agency', 'thinks', 'Yoko', 'sick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'hold', 'Sarah', 'house', 'cleaning', 'routine', 'banging/meowing', 'noise', 'taped', 'up', 'wall', 'open', 'boy', 'cat', 'again', 'cat', 'growling', 'back', 'doing', 'chores', 'Then', 'boy', 'top', 'stairs', 'so', 'So', 'Sarah', 'back', 'check', 'woman', 'talking', 'someone', 'room', 'staring', 'something', 'what', 'just', 'want', 'leave', 'alone', 'then', 'bed', 'up', 'corner', 'black', 'shadow', 'looking', 'thing', 'corner', 'look', 'fear', 'face', 'police', 'come', 'investigate', 'find', 'two', 'corpses', 'were', 'married', 'couple', 'son', 'old', 'woman', 'human', 'jaw', 'die', 'little', 'ghost', 'boy', 'end', 'out', 'little', 'boys', 'mother', 'had', 'crush', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'husband', 'killed', 'son', 'jealous', 'rage', 'then', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'came', 'then', 'killed', 'next', 'day.What', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

But nooooooo....Instead, ""The Grudge 2"" is a detailed, shimmering example of why people loathe sequels, and how (with rare exceptions like preplanned trilogies) they are pretty much always bad. Overused spooks, lackluster acting and a plotless plotline are only a few of the things wrong with this croaking horror.Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) learns that her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is seriously ill, and goes to Japan to fetch her -- with horrifying results. Karen's last warning: ""Don't go in that house.""Other people aren't doing the same, since a trio of schoolgirls went into the house and are now being haunted by everyone's least favorite croaking ghosts, Kayako and Toshio. And an American family in Chicago is being slowly destroyed by visions of the ghosts, which have somehow transferred out of Japan and into the United States.Aubrey and a reporter investigate the odd circumstances of Karen's madness and demise, going to the abandoned house that Karen tried to burn down. As the malevolent ghosts close in on them, Aubrey discovers the secret past that has turned Kayako into an evil force that cannot be stopped...Ghosts, ghosts, everywhere, and not one of them is actually scary. Apparently Takashi Shimizu assumed that the more apparitions you put in a movie, the scarier it becomes. Sadly, it doesn't work that way -- Kayako and Toshio pop up for a cheap care every few minutes, and when they aren't around, OTHER ghosts are popping up for no good reason.All those ghosts are mainly there to prop up a thin-as-paper storyline, with flaccid dialogue and a few cursory nods to the previous film. The schoolgirl storyline is completely disposable, and the Chicago one is a transparent set up for the inevitable (and dreaded) ""Grudge 3,"" during which the horror rules get recklessly broken. So only a third of the movie has any interesting content -- usually a few minutes of exposition about Kayako.It's rather sad that Gellar is the ruling force here, and she's only in it for a few minutes total. She's certainly more charismatic than the Tamblyn, who seems to be sleepwalking through her role. Ohga Tanaka and Takako Fuji provide some scares as the ghosts, even misused, but the rest of the cast is simply going through the motions of really tepid acting.""Grudge"" had its flaws, but it was a horror masterpiece compared to its disastrously pointless sequel -- it's all about piling as many ghostly appearances as possible into three thin plots.

While she has yet to receive her own assignment, she is always on-call to help someone sick - if needed. When one of her co-workers doesn't report into work, Karen is sent down to an eerie house, where she meets an old woman who does not speak, or eat. She simply sits there and stares into space. Upon further investigation, Karen finds a young Japanese boy taped up into the wall - a young kitten by his side. It is only after a short time that a vengeful spirit comes and attacks both Karen and the old woman, leaving Karen in severe shock, and killing the woman. The vengeful spirit possesses its victims, claiming their souls, then spreads its curse onto another victim, creating a series of unfortunate events. Karen, becoming obsessed with discovering the truth about this spirit, decides that she must either find a way to break the spell, or end up the next victim of a spirit that never dies - but always kills.Even after the mixed reviews I heard about this film, I wanted to view it myself. Perhaps because I'm a huge fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar's (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and CRUEL INTENTIONS), or maybe because I love horror movies. Either way, I purchased, I saw, and I loved THE GRUDGE. Sarah Michelle Gellar is amazing in her performance as Karen, and while she isn't necessarily the star of the film - no one really is - she has such screen presence, that you consider her being just that. Jason Behr (ROSWELL and PLEASANTVILLE) is interesting as the American boyfriend/Architecture student; however, he is another character with not much screen time.The strange thing with this film is that there is hardly any speaking throughout it; and when there is speaking, it is most often done in Japanese, with sub-titles. While this may sound unappealing to viewers, it actually gives the film a larger ""scare"" factor, and makes it more interesting.

In all Horror movies or thrillers, as a director, or writer, you must succed in answering the 'Why?' of the movie. I'll admit that they did that partially but, I wanted more of a reason. This movie was your typical shockfest with no real reason or resolve. Even watching the movie in the theatre, with many people making noises, I knew that the movie was going to be bad. I walked out the last twenty minutes of the movie. I'm going to give everyone a piece of advice for the purposes of this movie: If you have to seriously wait for the movie to answer the why throughout the whole movie, don't see it.True, some scary parts are scattered throughout but it's all for nothing and has no rhyme or reason. I'm surprised that this movie did so well in the box office. But, when you take a look at hollywood right now they have really been focusing on remakes and Japanese horror. And this is both. But, don't choose style over plot!I've even heard that they're making a GRUDGE 2. God help them. My friend told me that JU-ON, which is the original, was much more satisfying with much more reason.In short: The characters were flat, there were stupid characters just waltzing into a dark room not knowing what they were going to find, there are unexplained sightings of ghosts and things, the main character doesn't know what is going on and, quite frankly, doesn't hold your interest for too long.Just my opinion.

It is about a curse that is born when a person dies in the grip of a powerful rage or sorrow. The curse stays behind and manifests in the area the person died in. Those who go in the place where the person died become cursed and haunted by the spirit of that person. In the film, a Japanese woman named Kayako is murdered by her husband after he finds out she is cheating on him. He snaps her neck, then he goes upstairs and drowns his son Toshio and his cat in the bathtub. Then the husband hangs himself.The film takes place in Japan, and the main character is an American woman named Karen. The movie is told in a non-linear style, and jumps back and forth through time. Most of the film is about the characters going into the house and becoming cursed, haunted, and killed by the vengeful spirits of Kayako and Toshio. Kayako has long stringy black hair and she is often seen moving in a jerky way while making a creepy throat sound, and her son hisses and meows like his cat. The people are also often killed in the same way Kayako and Toshio were killed, but not always.My personal favorite scenes in this movie are when Yoko is attacked by Kayako, when we see Yoko without her jaw, and the ending where Kayako is crawling down the staircase.I really like this movie.

This movie isn't half as bad as the majority lead some to believe.The plot was fascinating, even if it is just another haunted house story, it is probably the best haunted house story I have seen and I have seen a lot. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this movie is scary, I didn't think so, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.I was very surprised on how well Sarah Michelle Gellar did in her role. Very shocked, I thought that this was just going to be another teen horror flick but it was surprisngly fun. It has taken me this long since it's release to watch the movie and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed in what I saw. And after watching the American version of the Ring, I thought I would be.So the moral of the story is that if you are afraid that this movie is going to suck, take a chance and at least watch it when it comes on TV. You may be surprised, just as I was, and end up liking. It taking place in Japan was an added plus.

872584,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B0006SGYL0,Graves,"[1, 1]","The great problem with making a sequel of a film that wasn't planned as a serries is that you have to make it similar enough to show it's a part of the original without being just a re-run. ""The grudge 2"" does that but it does have it's problems.Set after the first film Sarah Michelle Gellar movie where we learn a house is so cursed that anyone who crosses the threshhold is doomed.  Amber Tamblyn plays her younger sister who is sent to Japan to collect her sister (Gellar)who is in a hospital having had a break down and is accussed of burning down a house. This picks up from where the last movie ends with Gellar in hospital, though the first film implies she is about to die as the credits roll. Tamblyn finds her sister a wreck, in restraints and regularly trying to escape from the hospital's care.Naturally Tamblyn sets out to see what caused her sister's problems and joins up with a Japanese reporter to try and track down the history of the family. This is a success filmwise. Instead of just recreating the mistakes made by people in the first film, Tamblyn strikes out in a new direction. The movie has a B and C plot as well. The B plot, harkens back to the original jun on in which school girls enter the haunted house as a prank and as being haunted by the curse afterward. The C plot is set in an apartment house in Chicago that seems to be haunted. It is said that when she burned the house Gellar didn't destroy the curse but freed it to spread-but why Chicago? hmmm.Filmwise the sequal follows new ground while still staying true to the original but it really relies on the viewer to have seen either of the originals to get some of the repeat horror.  A great part in the original grudge was Gellar being obviously ill at ease in Japan, knowing she's an outsider and just trying to get through the subway system. Something we probably would all do. Also a major problem is Tamblyn, having stammered ""do you speak english?"" to two nurses when she gets to Japan she quickly seems comfortable taking a long train and bus journey into the wilderness. It breaks some of the fear of being completely isolated that Gellar brought to the first film.One scene from the b plot that must be mentioned for good acting is when one of the school girls goes to a ""love hotel' with her boy friend.  She has been coquettish and a flirt but as she waits for him while he showers a series of emotions play on her face and you realize she's a virgin and scared to death of being in the hotel with her boy friend. It's a case of great direction and excellent acting to watch it run across her face- excitment, curiousity, fear, exictment etc.In short the movie is well worth watching if you like Japanese horror AND have seen either the Grudge or Ju-on.

872587,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0006SGYL0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Short and sweet, THE GRUDGE 2 isn't nearly as spooky or as good asThe Grudgeor the ultra-creepyJu-on (The Grudge). Now, here's a fatter version of that sentence:In Japan, where ghosts run rampant, there is a house counted as one of the most haunted in all the land. That bleak house lies in Tokyo, and THE GRUDGE unveiled the origin of its rage-consumed haunt. THE GRUDGE 2 again centers on the haunt's murderous rampages as, this time, the spirit holds sway in three different story arcs and claims even more victims.The main storyline has Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) flying out to Tokyo to visit her estranged sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who languishes in a hospital even as she's charged with arson (detailed in the first GRUDGE film). Aubrey manages to briefly speak with a hysterical Karen before hospital staff restrain her. Karen's parting advice to Aubrey: ""Don't go in that house."" But Audbrey had already left. Soon, Karen also leaves.Meanwhile, three Tokyo schoolgirls, including an awkward and unpopular teen, venture into that cursed house. Minutes later they run away from it, screaming in utter fright. Naturally, that's not the end of it.The ghosts cross the waters in the third arc, which starts with the middle part and then backtracks to the beginning. In Chicago, a boy becomes curious about his apartment building's mysterious, hooded new tenant. But curiousity turns to fright as unsettling events begin to take place, his family beginning to warp.If you've already seen THE GRUDGE and the JUON installments, then there's really nothing new here for you. There wasn't for me. At this stage, I really do think that director Takashi Shimizu has done all he could with this franchise. The scares aren't very scary, and some of the key ""boo"" moments are telegraphed and then flatly choreographed (I thought the phone booth scene particularly lame).Some good things about this film. I didn't have a problem with the fractured, non-linear storytelling, with the jumping back and forth among the three different story arcs and with the film stepping out of chronological continuity. Folks have told me that they felt disoriented watching this flick, but, to me, it's a nice twist and forced me to pay attention. I also liked that the movie again offers no solution in vanquishing the vengeful spirit. In fact, one character even states knowingly that there simply isn't a solution to this haunt. Because of this, THE GRUDGE 2 gives off a certain disquieting vibe (although this isn't enough for me to recommend the film). To paraphrase someone from a bonus feature on this disc, Japanese horror tends to dabble more in the ambiguous and the subtle whereas American horror prefers the beast to be definitively vanquished. At least, until the sequel.Some decent bonus features here, but the ones I liked best are the behind-the-scenes featurettes: ""East Meets West"" - the official ""making of"" segment (15 minutes); ""The Grudge 2: Storyline Development"" - 11 minutes long and interesting, it goes in depth about the many debates and discussions which went on between the American and the Japanese factions (Taka Ichise, the Japanese producer, is refreshingly forthright and also critical of the American side); and ""Ready When You Are, Mr. Shimizu"" - a fun 13-minute focus on Director Takashi Shimizu.Again, with THE GRUDGE 2 (which isn't the same as JUON 2), we're entering the dreaded territory of been-there and done-that and thrill-me-with-something-new-already. Enough with that spooky kid who caterwauls like an alley cat. This sequel might give you goosebumps only IF you haven't seen THE GRUDGE or any of the JUON pictures. Amber Tamblyn, who was so good in JOAN OF ARCADIA, is drab here in her leading role. Sarah Michelle Gellar's star power is sorely missed, and one wishes she had more of an extended cameo. By the way, it's nice to have a Jennifer Beals sighting, however brief (as I used to heavily crush on her). Here, Jennifer does some extracurricular stuff with a skillet. But her storyline, as well as that of her film hubbie, should've been given more time to percolate and then detailed more onscreen. As it is, that whole arc feels abrupt. The milk guzzling scene, though, was effectively disconcerting.I guess, if you're a fan of Japanese horror cinema, this one's worth watching once. But, right afterwards, you just might take a skillet and do extracurricular things with it to your dvd player.",2,The scary hair is back,1193356800,"10 26, 2007",2007,4442,"['Short', 'sweet', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', '2', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'spooky', 'as', 'good', 'asThe', 'Grudgeor', 'ultra-creepyJu-on', 'Grudge', 'Now', 'here', 'fatter', 'version', 'sentence', 'Japan', 'where', 'ghosts', 'run', 'rampant', 'house', 'counted', 'one', 'most', 'haunted', 'land', 'bleak', 'house', 'Tokyo', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'unveiled', 'origin', 'rage-consumed', 'haunt', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', '2', 'again', 'centers', 'haunt', 'murderous', 'rampages', 'time', 'spirit', 'sway', 'three', 'different', 'story', 'arcs', 'claims', 'even', 'more', 'victims.The', 'main', 'storyline', 'Aubrey', 'Davis', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'flying', 'out', 'Tokyo', 'visit', 'estranged', 'sister', 'Karen', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'who', 'hospital', 'even', 'charged', 'arson', 'detailed', 'first', 'GRUDGE', 'film', 'Aubrey', 'briefly', 'speak', 'hysterical', 'Karen', 'hospital', 'staff', 'restrain', 'Karen', 'parting', 'advice', 'Aubrey', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'house', 'Audbrey', 'had', 'already', 'left', 'Soon', 'Karen', 'also', 'leaves.Meanwhile', 'three', 'Tokyo', 'schoolgirls', 'including', 'awkward', 'unpopular', 'teen', 'venture', 'cursed', 'house', 'Minutes', 'later', 'run', 'away', 'screaming', 'utter', 'fright', 'Naturally', 'not', 'end', 'it.The', 'ghosts', 'cross', 'waters', 'third', 'arc', 'middle', 'part', 'then', 'backtracks', 'beginning', 'Chicago', 'boy', 'curious', 'apartment', 'building', 'mysterious', 'hooded', 'new', 'tenant', 'curiousity', 'fright', 'unsettling', 'events', 'begin', 'take', 'place', 'family', 'beginning', 'warp.If', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'JUON', 'installments', 'then', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'stage', 'really', 'do', 'think', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'done', 'could', 'franchise', 'scares', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'scary', 'key', 'boo', 'moments', 'are', 'telegraphed', 'then', 'flatly', 'choreographed', 'thought', 'phone', 'scene', 'particularly', 'lame', '.Some', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'fractured', 'non-linear', 'storytelling', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'three', 'different', 'story', 'arcs', 'film', 'stepping', 'chronological', 'continuity', 'Folks', 'have', 'told', 'felt', 'disoriented', 'watching', 'flick', 'nice', 'twist', 'forced', 'pay', 'attention', 'also', 'liked', 'movie', 'again', 'solution', 'vanquishing', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'fact', 'one', 'character', 'even', 'knowingly', 'simply', ""n't"", 'solution', 'haunt', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', '2', 'certain', 'disquieting', 'vibe', ""n't"", 'enough', 'recommend', 'film', 'paraphrase', 'someone', 'bonus', 'feature', 'disc', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'dabble', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'subtle', 'whereas', 'American', 'horror', 'beast', 'be', 'definitively', 'vanquished', 'least', 'sequel.Some', 'decent', 'bonus', 'features', 'here', 'ones', 'liked', 'best', 'are', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'East', 'Meets', 'West', 'official', 'making', 'segment', '15', 'minutes', 'Grudge', '2', 'Storyline', 'Development', '11', 'minutes', 'long', 'interesting', 'depth', 'many', 'debates', 'discussions', 'went', 'American', 'Japanese', 'factions', 'Taka', 'Ichise', 'Japanese', 'producer', 'refreshingly', 'forthright', 'also', 'critical', 'American', 'side', 'Ready', 'When', 'Are', 'Mr.', 'Shimizu', 'fun', '13-minute', 'focus', 'Director', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu.Again', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', '2', ""n't"", 'same', 'JUON', '2', ""'re"", 'entering', 'dreaded', 'territory', 'been-there', 'done-that', 'thrill-me-with-something-new-already', 'Enough', 'spooky', 'kid', 'who', 'caterwauls', 'alley', 'cat', 'sequel', 'might', 'give', 'goosebumps', 'only', 'IF', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'JUON', 'pictures', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'JOAN', 'OF', 'ARCADIA', 'drab', 'here', 'leading', 'role', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'star', 'power', 'sorely', 'missed', 'one', 'had', 'more', 'extended', 'cameo', 'way', 'nice', 'have', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'sighting', 'however', 'brief', 'used', 'heavily', 'crush', 'Here', 'Jennifer', 'extracurricular', 'stuff', 'skillet', 'storyline', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'hubbie', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'more', 'time', 'percolate', 'then', 'detailed', 'more', 'onscreen', 'whole', 'arc', 'feels', 'abrupt', 'milk', 'guzzling', 'scene', 'was', 'effectively', 'disconcerting.I', 'guess', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'cinema', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'right', 'afterwards', 'just', 'might', 'take', 'skillet', 'do', 'extracurricular', 'things', 'dvd', 'player']",N/A

I'm not sure that it was as intense as the first one, but at the same time, it held some pretty intense parts. The one thing that's got me is the pacing of the movie. It's like a football game...Snap the ball and run for a while, something jumps out at you, tackle, then it's back to the starting line again. It's the anaerobic equivalent of exercise, and I'm sure it'll give you a few good jumps as well. But what's new with the film and what is it missing?I'm not going to go into too much detail, because you can expect more of the same here if you've seen the first one. It was pretty much a staple of the first film with more crazy imagery and a continuing plot. It's actually more or less a second part, and a long winded one at that.So we've got three stories wrapped up in one here. I love how they mix the time-frame, as they did in the first one and you really have to think after it's over to figure out which event happened when. The scares are pretty much the same though not as graphic as the first movie. It still seems to satisfy though, and there are some really good jumpy moments.

But of course, like most people, I am stupid and somehow allowed my friends to persuade me to watch it. The plot begins like most over used scary movie plots. Haunted house, has bad juju. No one wants to live in it because of some horrible grisly murder or double murder or triple murder, yada yada yada. But, instead of the usual stupid young family wanting to move in (""oh, honey wouldn't this be a great house for the kids?""), it's a...caretaker. I thought that was a cool twist, I admit. She's assigned to watch over the scary as all out house and it's mute, haunted occupant, an old lady.But then that's when it starts getting confusing AND very very very scary. Mother of god scary.First, the confusing stuff: I didn't understand the flashbacks. They confused me, and didn't help me understand why the croaky lady and the meowing boy were killing people. It didn't make sense to my tiny, innocent little brain. But, hey, that's me. But the flashbacks were really confusing. It didn't help me understand why the strange things were going on. Not at all.Now, to the scary stuff. Oh my god! Scary scary scary scary! Scary to the point I think I coulda peed my pants. (Then again, I'm NOT a scary movie fan.) The croaking lady, for starters. We are introduced to her in shadow in the beginning of the movie, as she snatches up a past caretaker and does something to the woman that leaves her dead. Then, the meowing boy. We are introduced to him a little while later, making the horrendous (and creepy) yowl that I thought only my cat could make if I didn't let her outside. And then the telephone call. Eeeek! Creepy as hell.Okay....I'm gonna stop now because I could go on forever about the scary stuff. It sums down to this: The American remake, while very disturbing and scary, tries too hard and falls very short without giving an explanation as to WHY the things happen to the occupants of the house like they do.

872601,A34HYR92HYZV0,B0006SGYL0,Jake Justus,"[3, 4]","To date, director Takashi Shimizu has made 6 JU-ON/GRUDGE films. What is interesting is that each one contributes something new to the ""Grudge Mythos."" None of the films are merely ""remakes"" of another one. Although I personally find the first theatrical  JU-ON film to be the cream of the crop, I think that this American version stands up well in its own right. It's a fantastic horror film, brimming with interesting ideas, unforgettable imagery and fine performances.If you are a Grudge enthusiast/completist, or if you've simply been meaning to pick-up a copy of the film, this Unrated Director's Cut is worth adding to your collection. The added footage is welcome, as are the excellent extras.The feature commentary by director Takashi Shimizu, producer Taka Ichise, and actress Takako Fuji (who plays the iconic, long-haired ghost, Kayako) is a pleasure from start to finish. It's exactly what a commentary should be, a combination of information and entertainment. The three are obviously having a ball doing the commentary and there are times when they sound as though they're giving their film the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" treatment. I was laughing out loud at times. In addition, Shimizu offers some interesting insights on the film's imagery, what it was like working with an American cast, etc. This commentary alone is worth the price for Shimizu fans.Also included in the Extras is a generous helping of deleted scenes. GRUDGE fans will enjoy comparing and contrasting these scenes with the earlier films in the franchise, especially the two original made-for-Japanese-television JU-ON films. As a welcome bonus, Shimizu, Ichise and Fuji offer interesting commentaries on all of the deleted scenes.This DVD edition also contains two early, very short (about 3 minutes apiece) Shimizu films based upon his ""Grudge mythology."" What is interesting about these shorts is that they both relate to events which occur in the original made-for-TV JU-ON films.For my money, the original JU-ON is the gold standard of horror cinema, and Takashi Shimizu is the reigning king of cinematic horror. I believe that, given the compromises which were forced upon Shimizu by his American producers, he still created a very worthy entry into the ""Grudge mythos"" -- and a brilliant film, period -- with his American version of the story.If you want THE GRUDGE in your DVD collection, THIS is the edition to buy!",5,A Must-Have,1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,2413,"['date', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'made', '6', 'JU-ON/GRUDGE', 'films', 'What', 'interesting', 'one', 'something', 'new', 'Grudge', 'Mythos', 'None', 'films', 'are', 'merely', 'remakes', 'one', 'personally', 'find', 'first', 'theatrical', 'JU-ON', 'film', 'be', 'cream', 'crop', 'think', 'American', 'version', 'up', 'well', 'own', 'right', 'fantastic', 'horror', 'film', 'brimming', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'unforgettable', 'imagery', 'fine', 'performances.If', 'are', 'Grudge', 'enthusiast/completist', ""'ve"", 'simply', 'been', 'meaning', 'pick-up', 'copy', 'film', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'added', 'footage', 'welcome', 'are', 'excellent', 'extras.The', 'feature', 'commentary', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'producer', 'Taka', 'Ichise', 'actress', 'Takako', 'Fuji', 'who', 'iconic', 'long-haired', 'ghost', 'Kayako', 'pleasure', 'start', 'finish', 'exactly', 'what', 'commentary', 'should', 'be', 'combination', 'information', 'entertainment', 'three', 'are', 'obviously', 'having', 'ball', 'doing', 'commentary', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'sound', ""'re"", 'giving', 'film', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'treatment', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'times', 'addition', 'Shimizu', 'interesting', 'insights', 'film', 'imagery', 'what', 'was', 'working', 'American', 'cast', 'etc', 'commentary', 'alone', 'price', 'Shimizu', 'fans.Also', 'included', 'Extras', 'generous', 'helping', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'GRUDGE', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'comparing', 'contrasting', 'scenes', 'earlier', 'films', 'franchise', 'especially', 'two', 'original', 'made-for-Japanese-television', 'JU-ON', 'films', 'welcome', 'bonus', 'Shimizu', 'Ichise', 'Fuji', 'offer', 'interesting', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes.This', 'DVD', 'edition', 'also', 'two', 'early', 'very', 'short', '3', 'minutes', 'apiece', 'Shimizu', 'films', 'based', 'Grudge', 'mythology', 'What', 'interesting', 'shorts', 'relate', 'events', 'occur', 'original', 'made-for-TV', 'JU-ON', 'films.For', 'money', 'original', 'JU-ON', 'gold', 'standard', 'horror', 'cinema', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'reigning', 'king', 'cinematic', 'horror', 'believe', 'given', 'compromises', 'were', 'forced', 'Shimizu', 'American', 'producers', 'still', 'created', 'very', 'worthy', 'entry', 'Grudge', 'mythos', 'brilliant', 'film', 'period', 'American', 'version', 'story.If', 'want', 'GRUDGE', 'DVD', 'collection', 'THIS', 'edition', 'buy']",N/A

However, I think there are a lot of things taken for granted in Japan that Americans don't really understand.So at the end of the movie I was left scratching my head thinking, ""What did I just watch?""  I understand how the killings started, so maybe a better question was, ""What was the point of this?""  The ending is not an ending at all, but more an opening for a possible sequel.The strongest aspect of this movie was that the bulk of the gore was left to the imagination of the viewer.  You don't see people getting killed, you see it coming and then the rest is up to you.  I think this actually makes it more scary than seeing what actually does happen.The best part is that it lowers the rating from an 'R' rating to a 'PG-13' so more people can see it.  With an 'R' rating, this movie would not have made as much as it actually did.However, if you like a scary movie then go ahead and watch this.

Yoko hears something and searches around the house for noise.  She opens a door, similar to a closet and looks around as if it's an attic.  Suddenly something pulls her up and she is gone.Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the substitute caregiver to take care of Emma.  She finds Emma in horrible conditions.  After cleaning her up, she too begins to hear noises.  She finds a black cat with one yellow eye and one green eye and a Japanese boy.  After discovering the cordless phone gone, she sees out the corner of her eye someone walk by the door in Emma's room.  She opens the sliding door and Emma is frightened.  Emma says, ""I just want her to leave me alone"".  Suddenly frightened again, Karen turns around and sees the most horrifying thing of all.This movie centers around Emma and people connected to her.

Armour,"[9, 12]","Many have given ""The Grudge"" a very unjust rating, most likely because it isn't the typical American mindless gore that we have seen in so many horror films of both the past (Friday the 13th?) and present (Seed of Chucky?).  While those films cirtainly have appeal to many fans of the genre, they hardly require your strict attention to follow the plot.  ""The Grudge"" is different in that it doesn't use gore, or even violence (for the most part) to accomplish the scare.  Instead it uses long approaches into scenes in which the audience can anticipate the outcome but is still startled and surprised when it actually happens.The ending to the movie has been one of its most criticized points, but it is very much in sticking to Japanese tradition where man is not the stronger than the spirit world surrounding him, and with many of the other modern horror flicks.Overall I am not a fan of the horror genre - usually finding them more funny in their rediculousness than scary, but I can say that this is one of the very few movies that have actually scared me.  To me that is all it takes to be a good horror movie.I enthusiastically recomend it and agree with one of the other reviewers here - it is better to watch it once, then watch all of the special features - including the cast & crew commentary - and then watch it again to pick up on all the things you missed the first time.The only bad comment I might have is that noone ever really fought for their life, and I doubt many of the characters would have been so ,literally, scared stiff.",5,The Grudge,1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,1549,"['Many', 'have', 'given', 'Grudge', 'very', 'unjust', 'rating', 'most', 'likely', ""n't"", 'typical', 'American', 'mindless', 'gore', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'past', 'Friday', '13th', 'present', 'Seed', 'Chucky', 'films', 'cirtainly', 'have', 'appeal', 'many', 'fans', 'genre', 'hardly', 'require', 'strict', 'attention', 'follow', 'plot', 'Grudge', 'different', ""n't"", 'use', 'gore', 'even', 'violence', 'most', 'part', 'accomplish', 'scare', 'Instead', 'long', 'approaches', 'scenes', 'audience', 'can', 'anticipate', 'outcome', 'still', 'startled', 'surprised', 'when', 'actually', 'ending', 'movie', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'criticized', 'points', 'very', 'much', 'sticking', 'Japanese', 'tradition', 'where', 'man', 'not', 'stronger', 'spirit', 'world', 'surrounding', 'many', 'other', 'modern', 'horror', 'flicks.Overall', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'horror', 'genre', 'usually', 'finding', 'more', 'funny', 'rediculousness', 'scary', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'actually', 'scared', 'be', 'good', 'horror', 'movie.I', 'enthusiastically', 'recomend', 'agree', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'better', 'watch', 'once', 'then', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'cast', 'crew', 'commentary', 'then', 'watch', 'again', 'pick', 'up', 'things', 'missed', 'first', 'time.The', 'only', 'bad', 'comment', 'might', 'have', 'noone', 'ever', 'really', 'fought', 'life', 'doubt', 'many', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'literally', 'scared', 'stiff']",N/A

Towards the end, Sam Raimi reveals that a ""director's cut"" may/will be released a couple of months after this initial release.  That not-here version will apparently include 3 more minutes of horror, shock, and gore, but will delete the rooftop scene in which the main detective explains to Sarah Michelle Gellar's character the mystical/spiritual basis for what's happening.  We are told that the detective's explanation, which isn't all that complicated or helpful anyway, would be superfluous to the Japanese audience, which is (say the cast and crew) already accustomed to...well, actually I wonder.  Am I to understand that EVERYONE in Japan expects that when an awful murder happens in a house, future residents should expect to be killed by their ghosts?  No wonder the realtor in this movie kept quiet about the dysfunctional bathtub.Anyway, if you're wild about this movie you may want to hold out for a couple of months before buying this version.  I went for a certain national chain's promotion and got this DVD along with the Japanese version, ""Ju-On,"" as a package deal.  I haven't watched that yet, but Sam, Sarah, and company said that the rooftop scene isn't in ""Ju-On"" either.Clearly I also disagree with Roger Ebert's one-star lambasting of ""The Grudge,"" not only because I am a big fan of Ms. Gellar but because I found the pacing, camera shots, sets, and the music appropriately chilling.

872623,A3BC8YL69NOCUP,B0006SGYL0,jmpg,"[1, 7]","The Grudge plays exactly how a horror film should. An orchestrated series of incidents coupled with a protagonist who's trying to get to the bottom of things. Following the cult success of the much talked-about (but pretty lackluster) The Ring, this is another Japan-originated production which has made its way to Western shores. Does it keep afloat in the world of horror, or sink like its preceding overseas cousin? While it does have its scare attributes to contribute to its genre, The Grudge never allows its story to surpass its moments of terrifying fun, and it's a shame that the effectiveness of the so-called fun wears out almost too soon.Although keenly reliant on story logic, the biggest problem isn't exactly a lack of horror elements or one-sided cliched characters, but that the plot progresses rather sluggishly behind a curtain of tried-and-true tactics. The truth behind the entire mystery is eventually uncovered, but a ridiculous amount of stereotypical `don't-open-that-door' type scenes overly dominates the movie, with one happening after another and another. While this sounds fitting for The Grudge, the sequence of events become all too predictable and repetitive to a point you know the film is trying to prepare more scares. The split-second frights are especially grating after the first several attempts and serve as cheap annoying distractions while its bizarre use of telling the story at different times makes an uneven mess. By the time it ends, it feels as though the movie has exhausted itself.On the plus side, the characters aren't the usual you would find like most of the similar kind. Expect them to be well integrated into the movie's appropriate atmosphere. Also, the film does have its moments to have you bounce in your seat and feel uneasy, and may even perhaps provide a good laugh or two. If you have yet to see any of the previous Ju-On movies, then this remade version isn't a bad place to start. In a time when horror films seem to be waning down, The Grudge could rejuvenate your interest in them once more. But others should be forewarned, since it is a pretty forgettable film after one viewing. Creepy flicks tend to leave a lasting impression long after they end, but The Grudge isn't one of them. Although it may make you jump early on, don't expect to maintain that frightened feeling for long once that same door is repeatedly being opened, over and over.",1,"The usual ""don't-go-in-that-room!"" style horror",1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,2416,"['Grudge', 'exactly', 'how', 'horror', 'film', 'should', 'orchestrated', 'series', 'incidents', 'coupled', 'protagonist', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'bottom', 'things', 'Following', 'cult', 'success', 'much', 'talked-about', 'pretty', 'lackluster', 'Ring', 'Japan-originated', 'production', 'made', 'way', 'Western', 'shores', 'keep', 'afloat', 'world', 'horror', 'sink', 'preceding', 'overseas', 'cousin', 'have', 'scare', 'contribute', 'genre', 'Grudge', 'never', 'story', 'surpass', 'moments', 'terrifying', 'fun', 'shame', 'effectiveness', 'so-called', 'fun', 'out', 'almost', 'too', 'soon.Although', 'keenly', 'reliant', 'story', 'logic', 'biggest', 'problem', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'lack', 'horror', 'elements', 'one-sided', 'cliched', 'characters', 'plot', 'rather', 'sluggishly', 'curtain', 'tried-and-true', 'tactics', 'truth', 'entire', 'mystery', 'eventually', 'uncovered', 'ridiculous', 'amount', 'stereotypical', ""don't-open-that-door"", 'type', 'scenes', 'overly', 'movie', 'one', 'happening', 'fitting', 'Grudge', 'sequence', 'events', 'become', 'too', 'predictable', 'repetitive', 'point', 'know', 'film', 'trying', 'prepare', 'more', 'scares', 'split-second', 'frights', 'are', 'especially', 'grating', 'first', 'several', 'attempts', 'serve', 'cheap', 'annoying', 'distractions', 'bizarre', 'use', 'telling', 'story', 'different', 'times', 'uneven', 'mess', 'time', 'movie', 'exhausted', 'plus', 'side', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'usual', 'would', 'find', 'most', 'similar', 'kind', 'Expect', 'be', 'well', 'integrated', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'atmosphere', 'Also', 'film', 'have', 'moments', 'have', 'bounce', 'seat', 'feel', 'uneasy', 'may', 'even', 'perhaps', 'provide', 'good', 'laugh', 'two', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'previous', 'Ju-On', 'movies', 'then', 'remade', 'version', ""n't"", 'bad', 'place', 'start', 'time', 'when', 'horror', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'waning', 'down', 'Grudge', 'could', 'rejuvenate', 'interest', 'once', 'more', 'others', 'should', 'be', 'forewarned', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'film', 'one', 'viewing', 'Creepy', 'flicks', 'tend', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'long', 'end', 'Grudge', ""n't"", 'one', 'may', 'make', 'jump', 'early', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'maintain', 'frightened', 'feeling', 'long', 'once', 'same', 'door', 'repeatedly', 'being', 'opened']",N/A
872624,A64PKVY0MSBWR,B0006SGYL0,"J. Murdoch ""Creative Sparkplug""","[0, 0]","I'm curious about why so many reviewers made a point of saying this movie was nothing like The Ring other than the fact that both are Americanized remakes of the Japanese originals. The two films are very similar in that they are both ghost stories...very Japanese ghost stories. In fact, I kind of wish I had seen The Grudge before I saw The Ring because the Grudge (and the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu) explains why both films were so creepy and disturbing.At the heart of both film's effectiveness is the difference between Western and Eastern ghost tales. In the West, there is almost always some type of redemption: the wicked are punished, the innocent are damaged but wiser, and the ghost is at peace. In Eastern stories, ghosts (at least those of a person who died confused and angry) are always hungry for revenge and can never be at peace. In addition, anyone is fair game no matter how guilty or innocent. One of the shockers in The Ring is the false conclusion where we find out that what we thought put the ghost at peace had no effect at all other than to solve the mystery of how the girl died.The demons are also very Eastern: not the ugly, leering Christian demons from hell but ones that are unsettling and watchful. More portents of distruction than bringers.I actually appreciated the restraint with CGI and gore after having seen Exorcist: The Beginning just the night before. Although the thinking behind films these days seems to be that the audience expects lots of gore and special effects (otherwise they won't pay to see the film), I think the over-the-top approach usually detracts from the story as was the case in Exorcist I (which had potential but ended up being an abortion of a movie).The non-linear approach to telling the story didn't bother me; in fact I enjoyed it because it sustained the mystery. In another inevitable comparison to The Ring, I think The Grudge, is far more satisfying it it's explaination for why the vengeful ghost and why the seemling indiscriminate selection of victims.One more plus, the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu were a lot more enlightening than the typical gushing sound bites you find on most DVDs. They seemed to have left the over the top superlatives to the American performers.The movie has some weaknesses which is why I gave it only three stars.First, the pacing seems glacial: there aren't many extreme emotional events for the first 30 minutes. Even events that seem like they should be disturbing, left me feeling ""why should I care?"" Because Sam Raimi (""Evil Dead"" and ""Spiderman"") isn't exactly the most understated of filmakers, I imagine the quietness and pacing of the film was a deliberate decision. For me, it didn't work.Second, the lead played by Sarah Michelle Geller, seemed to be not much more than a one-dimensional vehicle for keeping the story moving.

Karen volunteers for Alex (TED RAIMI) When not in school, providing care for those confined to their homes. When she is assigned to take the job of Yoko (played by YOKO MAKI), because she didn't show up, Karen is sent to look after Emma Williams (GRACE ZABRISKIE), the elderly, senile mother to transplanted Americans Matthew (played by WILLIAM MAPOTHER) and Susan (played by KaDEE STRICKLAND)..A series of haunting encounters in the house, disturb Karen, as it appears that anyone who enters will be haunted by the former occupants there or anywhere else they go.As she tries to get to the bottom of what's occurring in the apparently haunted house, as does local cop Nakagawa (played by RYO ISHIBASHI), she discovers that it might have something to do with American professor Peter Kirk (played by BILL PULLMAN) who purposefully ended his life long before she arrived there.I won't `ruin' the story from there on, but it only gets wore.

I'm not going to bother writing a basis of the story, it's pretty obvious if you've seen the first one and if you've read some of the other reviews too. It's not very scary, especially in the opening sequence, with the three schoolgirls going into the house, where we all know something bad will happen and no I'm not talking about the acting or the writing or the pacing, all of which are bad and sometimes painful to experience during the movie. In fact no sequence is very scary, or scary at all in the whole movie.Okay maybe I'll tell a little of the story, the sister of Sarah Michele' character comes to Japan and tries to find out what happened to her. She meets a Hong Kong journalist and low and behold they go into the house and guess what the ghost is there. You would think if they are aware of the ghost that they would just stay away from the house and maybe it wouldn't bother them, but no.There's more to the story but it's jumbled and messy. It's like the director tried to make three bad short movies and loosely (and I mean loosely) tie them together, into one really bad movie that seems a lot longer than it really is. The pacing of all the scary scenes is off, like the opening scene and when the sister goes into the house and in the school counselor's office, the later one, all badly paced and acted.Plus we know when the scares are coming and are not shocked at all when they appear. The ghost itself is a lot (and I mean a lot) less frightening than in the first one, of course everything is less frightening, except the acting, pacing, yadda, yadda. And unfortunately I fear a third one could happen as the very (and I emphasize very) lame ending shows, but hears hoping not.

872635,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B0006SGYL0,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[1, 3]","*No Spoilers*We had enough of lame Japanese films. This new ""wave"" of horror movies like ""The Ring,"" ""Pulse"" and now ""The Grudge 2"" doesn't seem to have an end. The genre is played out but that didn't stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow-up of the decent 2004 first version. To understand this film--which is nearly impossible until the end--you would have to see the first movie.Brief Story:The film has basically three plots, but in a way they are connected to each other. The first plot is a follow-up of what happened to Karen Davis (Sara Michele Gellar) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house. Mrs. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) asks her other daughter Aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister Karen. She travels to Japan to bring Sara home. Now in Japan, she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house, but something terrible is about to happen.The second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house. One of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we don't know about. Suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child. She tries to get out but the door jammed. They all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost. Unfortunately, they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited.The third plot takes place in the US where a new family moves to an old building. A young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the ""strange lady"" that lives next door has something to do with it. People are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence.Review:Less scary and sillier than the original, ""The Grudge 2"" takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience. The movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them. We have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other. This time around the ghosts are outsourcing from Japan to the US. They don't care whether you visit the house or not. Now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason. These ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way--even a young little boy--just to show their rage. The so-called scary moments are not scary at all. They are lame, mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version. What's sad is that, this time around, the writers have to make the actresses show some ""skin"" to please the male teen audience. This is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie.In the technical department the movie doesn't do a good job either. The editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion. We have three plots that are poorly mixed together. Sometimes we are in Japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the US. The photography of the film is identical to its predecessor, but that's the only thing that resemblances the original. In the sound department, the movie will make you laugh. We hear sillier noises than the original. Instead of getting scared, you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make--We personally like the angry ""kitty"" sound.The Verdict:A terrible sequel of a decent horror film, ""The Grudge 2"" could have been a straight-to-video release if it wasn't for the beautiful Sara Michelle Gellar.

Unfortunately, it was nowhere near as good as I had hoped. Of course, given the genre, and the fact that it was a sequel to a remake and not really a remake of a sequel, it was exactly what I expected. (Yes, I have high hopes, but realistic expectations.)I prepped myself for this by watching the unrated DVD of the previous film just a few short hours before heading to the theater, which, in hindsight, was probably a mistake. While the first film relied heavily on cheap scares and ""gotcha"" moments, the second toned it down a little and aimed at being a little more suspenseful. The end result is a chaotic mess with a convoluted storyline that weaves through time without ever indicating it (slightly confusing at the start, as there is a two year difference between the events we see throughout the film, but I will refrain from spoilers).The attempts at building suspense fall flat, as every significant event is telegraphed and, therefore, incredibly predictable even when you're not trying to think ahead of the film's pace. The kills themselves are far from satisfying, as they are simply more of the same that we saw the first time around. I'm sorry, but even if you have never watched the Asian originals, the creepy girl with the hair in her face and the hitch in her step fails to frighten after two Ring films, Dark Water, Pulse, and, of course, the previous Grudge film.I had seriously hoped that Takashi Shimizu would bring some of his style to the film. Alas, we are the real victims here, not those portrayed on the screen, as we have to pay hard-earned dollars to witness (yet another) American Cinema (read: Hollywood) bastardization of a quality film. When will they learn that the true appeal of Asian cinema lies not with the creepy girl and the cheap scare, but with the overall feel of the film?

I'm not talking about Sarah (BUFFY) Michelle Gellar, not this time, but instead I speak today of Grace Zabriskie, the actress who plays the elderly woman who sleeps on the floor and seems so haunted by the violent deaths of everyone she knows.Grace Zabriskie has one of those faces you've seen over and over again, often playing disturbed or Satanic mothers along the lines of Angela Lansbury's character in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  Her other forte is playing supportive, rather helpless and pathetic mothers who are nevertheless sweet and loving.  I first became aware of Ms. Zabriskie's sweeping talent while watching the US soap opera of the 1980s, SANTA BARBARA.  She took a nothing part and filled it with every kind of theatrical, filmic gesture, elevating an ordinary show into the kind of thing you would tape every day just on the off chance that she would make an appearance on it.  (That's actually not fair to SB which in many ways was one of the most innovative shows on TV.)  Then my friends who knew I liked Grace Zabriskie would call me and tell me they had spotted her in other shows and films.  She played one of the hardened factory hands in NORMA RAE and she excelled in DRUGSTORE COWBOY.  She was the mother of Laura Palmer in the series of TWIN PEAKS, and she was Debra Winge's mother in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN.  Need I say more?  For twenty-five years she has been giving us her all, and in THE GRUDGE she gives no quarter to the general shoddiness of the production.  She attacks the part as though she were playing Gertrude in HAMLET (which she is in a way).  Watch her as she turns white, and her struggles for breath, and her anguished pleas to Sarah Michelle Gellar, the co-star with whom she seems to have the most empathy.

It's really a sad time for the genre right now.The Grudge is another movie to jump on the band wagon of watered down horror/thriller movies (Darkness, White Noise, Boogeyman) that really offers nothing but cheap thrills to people who are easily frightened by simple scare tactics and shock value. And I am not one of those people. What ever happened to the horror movie rule that ""if you can't scare them, gross them out with blood and gore""? I was perfectly happy with horror films that lacked in the scare department but made up for it in the blood and guts department.But don't go thinking that the only reason I didn't like this movie was that it didn't have enough violence. I'm just not a person who is easily startled by jumpy scenes, especially in movies like The Grudge. Some of my favorite horror films have little to no gore (Halloween, The Shining, The Blair Witch Project). I like the type of scary movie that gets inside my head and scares me psychologically, not movie's with whimpy ghost popping out of a closet.Other than that, The Grudge offers not too great of acting, almost no plot, and is not scary at all.

In my opinion this movie represents a glimpse into the future of filmmaking.Perhaps it is a cultural problem with the concepts of the supernatural between westerners and asians.  In our movies, ghosts and demons have to have a purpose or a Satanic director but asian ghosts do not.  Asian ghosts simply exist and they have no explanation.  That being said, the ghosts in this movie do have a plan but the filmmakers feel they don't have to explain.  I will grant that the film feels very brief.  Obviously it was planned with sequels in mind so only part of Peter's, Karen's, Toshio's and Kayako's stories are told.  But the hints are there if you look for them.  Karen, like Peter, is one of the only characters who looks at the boy in his non-demonic form.  The female demon constantly resists attacking her.  Could she have some relation to Peter?  We don't know yet but at the end, it is clear that the demons have something very special planned for Karen.As to the future of films, watch the documentaries included with the DVD.  The Japanese crew filmed extremely efficiently and economically.  But the movie never feels rushed or shortchanged.  The set design is fantastic!  From the glamorous high-rise apartment of the investment banker, Peter's modest Professor apartment, Karen's student hovel filled with japanese and american knick-knack's to the haunted house itself, everything feels lived in and natural.  Nothing looks as if it has been ripped out of the pages of Pottery Barn like the set design in American films today.  The surroundings are used to explain the life of the characters.  It opens big showing them living their international lives then squeezing out the life in them.I found the film terrifying and it made me jump more than once.

872656,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006SGYL0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","I knew this 2004 horror film was a remake of the Japanese movie ""Ju-on,"" in the tradition of ""Ringu""/""The Ring,"" but I did not know that it was filmed in Japan by the same director, Takashi Shimizu (I tend to avoid finding out a lot about films until I actually see them so that I be pure of mind when I first watch them). This makes a big difference because the idea behind this production is behind both the strengths and the weaknesses of ""The Grudge"" as a film. However, since I lived in Japan for a couple of years, have enjoyed Japanese films in general and ""Spirited Away"" in particular, and have an ability to understand non-linear narrative forms, I have to admit that I have a peculiar position from which to view the film (so take what follows with a grain of salt).As the opening of the film explains, ""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury."" When you listen to the DVD extras you learn that there is another key ingredient: the source of that rage is that the victim does not know why they were murdered. This is important because this is not your typical American horror movie where the guilty die grizzly deaths. The innocent are the only items on the menu this time around. If you want other clear indications that this is a Japanese horror movie then notice that Shimizu goes for the creeps over suspense (guessing who is next to die is never difficult), the camera never lingers on the film's grossest images, and seeing the ghost happens early and often. The last one presents the most problems in terms of cultural translation because the Japanese conception of demons is so foreign to American audiences (I know, duh, but it is true) as is the idea of a Japanese monster house (""Obakeyashiki"").Executive producer Sam Raimi had seen ""Ju-on"" and came up with the idea of remaking the movie in Japan with the same director but with American actors for an English speaking audience. So this is not the same thing as splicing in scenes of Raymond Burr to turn ""Gojira"" into ""Godzilla,"" but it is somewhat pointed in that same direction. Stephen Susco's screenplay has to come up with reasons why the American actors are working (and dying) in Japan and while he certainly comes up with plausible means of employment, there is an elephant in the living room in that the body count consists mostly of gaijin but that is never a part of the equation. Granted, Detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) is suspicious of the house given what had happened three years earlier, but this film really needed to deal with the gaijin issue better (I was going to say that having more Japanese killed off in the movie would help, but then we have the problem a gaijin being the heroine in a story set in Japan).However, at some point a decision was made for Jeff Betancourt to edit ""The Grudge"" in a non-linear fashion. Now, what they came up with is an interesting approach, but clearly most viewers are not picking up on what is happening right away. Beginning with the opening deaths before the title credits are over, ""The Grudge"" follows the first death backwards to the beginning of the tale and the second forward to the ending. These two plotlines alternate to the climax in which they actually come together. Unfortunately, this is just way too convenient as the only way that our heroine can understand what is going on. At a point where the puzzle is coming together we are wondering how this is happening when the focus should be on understanding why everything is happening.Another way in which the production is more interesting than the movie is the limited use of CGI. Throughout the commentary track, Sarah Michelle Gellar talks about the lengths to which Japanese filmmakers keep things real. The shot of the hand coming out of the back of her character's head in the shower is not a CGI shot. The ghost creepily crawling down the stairs is all the performance of actress Takako Fuji and not a puppet on wires or anything else. When characters listen to messages on an answering machine, there are actually messages on the answering machine. But, again, unless you check out the DVD extras you have no way of appreciating the realism of this particular movie. The more you check out the more you will rethink what is going on in the movie.""The Grudge"" is a creepy movie where the ghost is a lot more interesting than Karen the heroine. But then most of the characters are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time so that bad things can happen to them. Still, my wife screamed twice and jumped three times while watching this, so it can have the desired effect (at least on those unaccustomed to the way modern horror films work). More importantly, the attempt to make a Japanese horror movie for Americans, versus an American version of a Japanese horror movie, is worth paying attention to. Ultimately, I am trying to convince you to watch this movie twice, after checking out all of the DVD features in between.",4,More of an interesting production than a great horror movie,1147737600,"05

872662,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0006SGYL0,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","I found this horror film watchable, but still it disappointed me a little as it is nowhere near the level of ""The Ring"". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.PRECISION: I never watched the original ""Ju-on: the grudge"" Japanese version so I am unable to compare it to this American remake.Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is an American nurse living and working in Tokyo. She is efficient and hardworking and therefore she handles already numerous assignments, but her boss Alex (Ted Raimi) asks her to take one more patient, an aged American woman named Emma Williams (Grace Zabriskie). Emma lives alone in a large and old (by Tokyo's standards) house and she needs care because she suffers from dementia and lethargy  - or Yoko (Yoko Maki), the usually very reliable previous nurse assigned to her didn't report to work for a couple of days...This actually is not the real beginning of the story, because the action of this film is as non-linear as it is humanly possible, with numerous flash-backs and with some new plots kicking in all the time - and that is precisely part of my problem with ""The Grudge"". Non-linear narration is a very excellent thing but only if the director keeps things under strict control - here it is not the case and even if the logic of the story is ultimately preserved it takes a great effort to keep up with the developments. Personally, considering that the film was not so good anyway, towards the end I didn't feel like making this effort anymore because all those narrative acrobatics tired me instead of intriguing...The other problem I had with this film that, unlike the chillingly terrifying ""The Ring"", this film is hardly scary AT ALL. There is only a couple of really good scenes, but in a 92 minutes film it is not nearly enough.The main strength of this film is in Sarah Michelle Gellar, who reveals herself here as a much better actress than usually believed - and of course she is still cute as a button, exactly as in ""Buffy"" TV series. Her character is likeable and clearly vulnerable (do not expect any martial arts) and therefore I was concerned about what will happen to her all the time - it was actually what kept me watching this thing until the very end...The other asset is Detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi), a tough, courageous and competent police officer who already had to do with Emma's house in the past and is clearly scared s***less by this place - but nevertheless will do his duty with cold, resigned resolution.Still, the good points notwithstanding, this is not a very successful film. Watchable, but nothing more and especially nowhere near the quality of ""The Ring"".",3,"""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born.

It wasn't jump out of your seat entertainment.  However, it was psychological and there was an undercurrent of terror throughout the movie.

But it is one that I love and have loved since childhood. Every thing from low budget movies like SQUIRM to high profile items like THE EXORCIST. That being said, it should come as no surprise that after numerous viewings of all things horrific, there is little to see that I would consider actually scary. Until tonight.The story is based around a Japanese legend that when someone dies under brutal or highly emotional circumstances, a curse is placed on that location that carries on to those who visit the site. After witnessing such an occurrence, we are introduced to Karen (Sarah Michelle Geller), a young woman living in Japan with her student boyfriend, who works as a care giver/nurse. Sent to the house where the first young nurse was killed (we know this but no one else does just yet), Karen is exposed to the ghosts that haunt the house, including a small boy and a terrifying lady with long black hair.Her charge found dead along with the couple who own the house, Karen is taken to a hospital. The movie plays fast and loose with moving in time and space to tell its story and it works well this way. We see these victims before they were killed, find out how they came to the house, find out the connection (only slightly at first) between a man who killed himself at the very beginning of the movie and this family and we find out more about the little boy. We are also treated to the grisly deaths of all, including the sister of the couple.It is through the use of storytelling, information that Karen finds online and later a discussion with the police detective assigned to the case, that we garner the whole story.

It seems to me that the people who did not LIKE the movie, did not GET the movie. And that's fine. I, however, really enjoyed the film.Let me put it this way. True evil never dies. It is always there, waiting to destroy anything it touches. Evil is destructive. That is what makes the Emperor in ""Star Wars"" so great. Or Sauron in the ""Lord of the Rings."" Beings that strive to dominate, crush, and destroy. What these antagonists do is give us the means for a story.  Without them, there is peace and harmony - not stuff that make such an exciting story.So, what makes a horror movie great?  I think that it depends on what the viewer brings to the film.  I have expectations, as I think I always do when reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or whatever.  I expect to be treated like an intelligent viewer, reader, or whatnot, that wishes to be entertained with quality craftmanship.""The Grudge"" does just that. You are expected to think. It lays out the story well, giving you time to warm up to the horror that will always be there, never die, and always win. What could be more frightening? You are not safe in your home under the covers. This thing will find you. And it will kill you whether you've been naughty or nice. It doesn't revel in needless gore, nor does it simply feel like a bad heavy metal music video. The movie is smart and frightening. That is why I enjoy the movie so much.

However, it's solemnity is one of its downfalls.  The movie seems longer than it really is and the non-linear editing keeps the storyline confusing, albeit interesting to a point.  Bill Pullman's suicide in the opening sequence goes unexplained for a long time and even when we find out what may have precipitated it, we don't know his true motivation:  guilt or was he compelled to do so because of the house's evil curse?  Sarah Michelle Gellar not only looks anorexic and anemic, but her performance is likewise uninspired.  Her years on Buffy may have convinced her that her presence alone is worth a viewer's interest, but I was really surprised at her lackluster participation.

872683,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0006SGYL0,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 4]","I didn't expect much from the Grudge.  Whenever a trailer has difficulty in explaining the plot, I lower my expectations.  ""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born"" seems a bit awkward.  The ""grip"" of a ""powerful"" rage?  Not a really bad rage?  What exactly is a rage's grip anyway?This challenge, the failure to explain exactly the plot behind the horror, saps the terror from the movie.  I should warn readers now that I'm going to make a lot of comparisons to The Ring, a movie that scared the living crap out of me, because the two have a lot of similarities. We are venturing into Spoilerland.So let's talk about similarities.  Although The Grudge is most certainly not a copy of The Ring, there are enough similarities to make comparisons inevitable. Besides the simplistic titles (""The NOUN, a new Japanese horror, coming to a theater near you!""), both films feature crawling girls with long hair covering their faces, a viral curse, and ghosts that defy the traditional boundary of staying in their respective haunted houses.  The climax is even similar: both heroines struggle to save the male love interest before he too becomes infected.The primary difference between the two films is style. Where The Ring creates a set of rules and then systematically breaks them (or, depending on your perspective, doesn't break them at all but stops reminding you about them), The Grudge isn't encumbered by such rules, to its detriment.  This makes the movie hard to follow. In addition, the scenes unfold out of order, explaining what happened to each victim and thereby illustrating the original murder, Memento style.Here's what I was able to piece together from the deleted scenes: Kayako (Takako Fuji) and Takeo (Takashi Matsuyama) Saeki move into a new home with their son, Toshio (Yuya Ozeki) and his pet cat.  While attending school, Kayako becomes infatuated with Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman), her professor.  When Takeo discovers her many love notes to the professor, he goes on a berserk rage, murdering Kayako, Toshio, and the cat. Then he kills himself.The curse kicks in pretty quickly after that.  Peter discovers something is wrong and visits the house, only to be infected by the curse, which eventually causes him to throw himself off a rooftop.Three years later, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her pretty-boy boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr) move to Japan as part of an exchange program.  Karen is a healthcare worker who specializes in taking care of the elderly.  A house now inhabited by the Williams family, including Matthew (William Mapother), his wife Jennifer (Clea DuVall), and Matthew's elderly mother Emma (Grace Zabriskie).  When the regular healthcare worker doesn't show up for work one day, Karen is called in to pick up the slack. She's got a new assignment that just happens to be in that Saeki house...The beauty of The Ring was the development of its characters.  It established people who, when faced with spreading evil or the death of their family, gladly chose the greater evil.  It dove into the complicated relationship between two parents in a modern age who don't know how to be adults, much less parents.  And it peeled away at the voyeuristic core in every one of us, who engages in peeping merely by sitting in a movie theater or watching television...and then punished us for it.The Grudge is not nearly so high-minded. The curse spreads quickly; so quickly, in fact, that I had a vision of the Japanese National Guard being finally called in to stop the madness when two hundred people are found dead at the Sakei house.  Ghosts change form, appear on camera, make weird cat noises, show up seemingly at random, and kill some people quickly but take longer to murder others.I've never been a fan of Gellar, and her performance didn't change my mind. Karen has no spark with Doug on screen, and their relationship is barely fleshed out.  Culture shock is briefly explored in Jennifer's struggle with understanding the Japanese world, but not enough to make us really feel her pain.  Not even Jennifer's relationship with Matthew has any real depth. And Gellar seems way too old to be a giddy exchange student.The only characters that are actually fleshed out are the members of the Sakei family.  The deleted scenes make it clear that we're not witnessing one traditional American ghost haunting, but a ghost house of sorts, which utilizes all four bodies (yes, even the cat), to kill its victims.  And we come to realize that they are all reenacting their deaths over and over, from the croak of Kayako's severed vocal chords to the shriek of Toshio's poor cat.  Unfortunately, critical plot points connecting the first murders with the subsequent deaths were cut, seriously undermining the shuffled scenes. Half the fun is piecing together why the curse took place and connecting the murders to the original event; when you can't make those connections, the film just becomes incoherent.And that's the problem.  With a ghost that can invade your office building, your home, or your bed, we lose all hope that the heroine can even defeat it.  The final solution, that the house must be burned to the ground, doesn't seem like a solution at all.  When the ghost(s) can look like people you know and call you on your cell phone, the evil seems to have such power that we never believe the heroine has a realistic chance of surviving.The movie is still creepy.  After all, Sam Raimi executive produced. The film is beautifully shot with minimal special effects.  The same creepy-crawly stumbling that made Samara so horrifying is in evidence here.  The Grudge also makes use of a multitude of horrible sounds, including the aforementioned caterwauling and death-rattling.Unfortunately, that's not enough to really make The Grudge a scary movie for

Still, I was tempted to test that idea that this was just a ""clunky piece of trash"" as my mom called it. I had never really watched many Japanese horror films besides the brilliant AUDITION, so I thought I would give this 'American' version of Ju-On: The Grudge a chance. What was my overall verdict? You'll find out later.At the beginning of the movie we meet Peter, a likable guy who later commits suicide, but for what? We find that out later. Cut to the next frame of the film in which we meet Yoko...a sweet and gentle Japanese girl who is tending to the care of a rather distraught old woman. The woman seems to have a sleeping disorder, so most of the time she is either sleeping or she is awake but silent, never really speaking at all. We do learn why she's in the state later on, and believe me once you see why you too will be scared. Now Yoko is left to clean up the mess in that house (absolutely no one in my home would ever leave a mess like this, and there are several parts in the film when the house is in complete disarray). Yoko suddenly hears a noise in one of the rooms on the upper level of the house, a thumping on the ceiling. As she goes to investigate after opening the door to the attic, she discovers to her terror a ghastly girl (Yuya Ozeki in creepy form like her ""Ju-On"" role) who attacks her, and the film cuts from there.Next up, we meet Karen and Doug (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr), two lovers and students studying abroad who seem very happy. Karen also works to help tend to the care of people much like Yoko was, and after the agency discovers her missing, Karen is placed in lieu of her mysterious departure. Karen goes to the house to to tend to the care of the woman, but she has no idea what she's in store for once she's there. You see, there's a curse on this house, and we don't know it at this point, but a family who lived in that house when through a deadly ordeal. The wife of the previous family had an affair with Peter (Bill Pullman's character, in top form here) and the husband found her out, so in a fit of rage, he drowned his son and murdered his wife before committing suicide. Karen has no idea that these events took place, but she will later. As time goes on, another family descends upon the house led by Jennifer (Clea Duvall, a rather disposable performance - she was better in The Faculty), who is rather depressed. The police are also investigating the disappearance of Yoko and some murders that have taken place, and they discover a jaw in the attic. Throughout the movie, anyone who comes into contact with ""the curse"" will ultimately be pursued by it until they are killed by its consumption. The moments in the high rise apartment are tense, but the scariest moment of the movie is when one of the agency workers is walking down the stairs and the beaten down Yoko appears, dragging herself towards the stairs going down. When the worker slowly heads in Yoko's direction, he slips on a substance on the floor...her blood. When he asks what happened, she turns around and reveals...oh, but I can't give it away. But let me say this, it scared me when I saw what happened to Yoko. The detective (Ryo Ishibashi) reveals the story behind the ""curse"" to Karen, and there are many moments in the movie where you will see flashbacks to the events that occured in the house. Later in the movie, Doug, disturbed by what's happened to Karen, who witnessed the ""curse"" firsthand, decides to go off investigating things in the house on his own. When Karen finds that out, she heads to the house where the climax comes into play. She relives moments of the past in the house, where Peter has come to find the mother hung by her neck and the child scared. Things aren't in a good state as Karen witnesses, but reality comes back into play and the scary girl is after Karen to kill her off.In the final frame of the film, director Takashi Shimizu delivers a nice close. With the body of Doug under covers after his death, Karen goes to his body and sees for herself, but the ""curse"" seems to have found her and suddenly someone is standing behind her - the ""curse"" girl who has been tormenting some of the previous contacts and the film cuts with that rasping noise and the girl's creepy eyes. It's bound to make you look forward to next year's The Grudge 2, due out October 26.In the meantime, the director's cut offers 8 minutes of unseen footage, and a plethora of extras. No doubt if you want to see a good remake of a classic Japanese horror film (JU-ON was scary), then THE GRUDGE should ultimately satisfy your appetite. While not a classic in its own merits, THE GRUDGE is the ultimate story of the worst kind of ""curse"" that could ever be left behind.",4,"Absolutely Scary, 'Grudge' Is No Easy Watch...",1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,4831,"['remember', 'when', 'mother', 'watched', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'ever', 'watched', 'Still', 'was', 'tempted', 'test', 'idea', 'was', 'just', 'clunky', 'piece', 'trash', 'mom', 'called', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'watched', 'many', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'brilliant', 'AUDITION', 'thought', 'would', 'give', ""'American"", 'version', 'Ju-On', 'Grudge', 'chance', 'What', 'was', 'overall', 'verdict', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'beginning', 'movie', 'meet', 'Peter', 'likable', 'guy', 'who', 'later', 'commits', 'suicide', 'what', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'Cut', 'next', 'frame', 'film', 'meet', 'Yoko', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'who', 'tending', 'care', 'rather', 'distraught', 'old', 'woman', 'woman', 'have', 'sleeping', 'disorder', 'most', 'time', 'sleeping', 'awake', 'silent', 'never', 'really', 'speaking', 'do', 'learn', 'why', 'state', 'later', 'believe', 'once', 'see', 'why', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'scared', 'Now', 'Yoko', 'left', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'house', 'absolutely', 'one', 'home', 'would', 'ever', 'leave', 'mess', 'are', 'several', 'parts', 'film', 'when', 'house', 'complete', 'disarray', 'suddenly', 'noise', 'one', 'rooms', 'upper', 'level', 'house', 'thumping', 'ceiling', 'investigate', 'opening', 'door', 'attic', 'terror', 'ghastly', 'girl', 'Yuya', 'Ozeki', 'creepy', 'form', 'Ju-On', 'role', 'who', 'film', 'cuts', 'there.Next', 'up', 'meet', 'Karen', 'Doug', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'two', 'lovers', 'students', 'studying', 'abroad', 'who', 'seem', 'very', 'happy', 'Karen', 'also', 'help', 'tend', 'care', 'people', 'much', 'Yoko', 'was', 'agency', 'missing', 'Karen', 'placed', 'lieu', 'mysterious', 'departure', 'Karen', 'house', 'tend', 'care', 'woman', 'idea', 'what', 'store', 'once', 'there', 'see', 'curse', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'point', 'family', 'who', 'lived', 'house', 'when', 'deadly', 'ordeal', 'wife', 'previous', 'family', 'had', 'affair', 'Peter', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'character', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'husband', 'found', 'out', 'so', 'fit', 'rage', 'drowned', 'son', 'murdered', 'wife', 'committing', 'suicide', 'Karen', 'idea', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'will', 'later', 'time', 'family', 'house', 'led', 'Jennifer', 'Clea', 'Duvall', 'rather', 'disposable', 'performance', 'was', 'better', 'Faculty', 'who', 'rather', 'depressed', 'police', 'are', 'also', 'investigating', 'disappearance', 'Yoko', 'murders', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'discover', 'jaw', 'attic', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'contact', 'curse', 'will', 'ultimately', 'be', 'pursued', 'are', 'killed', 'consumption', 'moments', 'high', 'rise', 'apartment', 'are', 'tense', 'scariest', 'moment', 'movie', 'when', 'one', 'agency', 'workers', 'walking', 'down', 'stairs', 'beaten', 'down', 'Yoko', 'dragging', 'stairs', 'going', 'down', 'When', 'worker', 'slowly', 'heads', 'Yoko', 'direction', 'substance', 'floor', 'blood', 'When', 'what', 'happened', 'around', 'reveals', 'oh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'let', 'say', 'scared', 'when', 'saw', 'what', 'happened', 'Yoko', 'detective', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'story', 'curse', 'Karen', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'movie', 'where', 'will', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'events', 'occured', 'house', 'Later', 'movie', 'Doug', 'disturbed', 'what', 'happened', 'Karen', 'who', 'witnessed', 'curse', 'firsthand', 'go', 'off', 'investigating', 'things', 'house', 'own', 'When', 'Karen', 'out', 'house', 'where', 'climax', 'play', 'moments', 'past', 'house', 'where', 'Peter', 'come', 'find', 'mother', 'hung', 'neck', 'child', 'scared', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'state', 'Karen', 'reality', 'back', 'play', 'scary', 'girl', 'Karen', 'kill', 'off.In', 'final', 'frame', 'film', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'nice', 'close', 'body', 'Doug', 'covers', 'death', 'Karen', 'body', 'sees', 'herself', 'curse', 'have', 'found', 'suddenly', 'someone', 'standing', 'curse', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'tormenting', 'previous', 'contacts', 'film', 'cuts', 'rasping', 'noise', 'girl', 'creepy', 'eyes', 'bound', 'make', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'year', 'Grudge', '2', 'due', 'October', '26.In', 'meantime', 'director', 'cut', '8', 'minutes', 'unseen', 'footage', 'plethora', 'extras', 'doubt', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'remake', 'classic', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'JU-ON', 'was', 'scary', 'then', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'should', 'ultimately', 'satisfy', 'appetite', 'not', 'classic', 'own', 'merits', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'ultimate', 'story', 'worst', 'kind', 'curse', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'left']",N/A

But, it had an extremely low budget of $10 million, which is not much at all for a marketable horror film. But, ""The Grudge"" has frightened American audiences from all walks of life. This film follows the tradition of ""The Ring"", ""28 Days Later"" and other classic horror films.The plot is formulaic, but the way used to describe it, which, I'm sure will be repeated over and over again is completely and utterly original. All horror movies have something they want from their audiences. But, this simply wants to make your flesh crawl. The Grudge is a film directed by Takashi Shimizu, who directed the Ju-On Trilogy. Ju-On was Japanese original films that triggered The Grudge.The movie is about an accident that happened in a house in Tokyo, Japan that was a murderous act of rage. And it is said in Japan that after something this horrible happens, a curse is left behind. And this curse haunts Karen Davis, an American exchange student working at a care center for a disturbed woman living in that house. One other thing I like about this haunting scare-fest is the fact that it doesn't reel the audience in. It asks them to go along for the ride, per se. The events do not happen in order. So, that might confuse some, but I think it is unique and clever.The DVD, though, has alot to be desired. It has a fascinating five-part documentary which time totals around 50 minutes, but there is no deleted film content, and the movie was way too short (an extremely modest 91 minutes) and if it had outtakes and deleted scenes, I'd be happy. But, for fans of the movie, there will be an extended director's cut being released in May.

The Grudge begins promisingly enough with Bill Pullman and a surprising turn of events, before introducing Sarah Michelle Gellar, in her first post-Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie that doesn't feature a computer animated talking dog, as a young American woman in Tokyo with her boyfriend (Roswell's Jason Behr).  Since the girl who usually watches an inept woman is missing, she gets the duty, and soon enough, plenty of spooky things are happening in this house, and the film shifts back and forth revealing the story of what happened.  As a previous reviewer stated, the Grudge is more of an intriguing production that a great horror film, with clever camera tricks substituting for CGI-animated ghosts and spectres.  However, the film is predictable to it's very end, and even though Shimizu is in the driver's seat once again, it's surprising how much this Americanized version fails in comparison to the original.  It's not half as creepy as it thinks it is, and despite a solid performance from Gellar, it's hard seeing her as a helpless damsal after years of watching her kick vampire behind.  In the end, the Grudge is a disappointing mainstream, teen-aimed thriller that fails to deliver, and while this ""unrated"" director's cut includes some more graphic footage, it's still worth avoiding for long time horror fans.",2,Could have been something special,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,1670,"['Evil', 'Dead', 'team', 'Sam', 'Spider-Man', 'Raimi', 'producer', 'Bob', 'Tapert', 'helped', 'bring', 'American', 'adaptation', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'Ju-On', 'Grudge', 'life', 'only', 'more', 'stripped', 'down', 'accessable', 'American', 'audiences', 'who', 'gushed', 'Ring', 'began', 'whole', 'new', 'horror', 'fad', 're-making', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Grudge', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'surprising', 'turn', 'events', 'introducing', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'first', 'post-Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'movie', ""n't"", 'feature', 'computer', 'animated', 'talking', 'dog', 'young', 'American', 'woman', 'Tokyo', 'boyfriend', 'Roswell', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'girl', 'who', 'usually', 'inept', 'woman', 'missing', 'duty', 'soon', 'enough', 'plenty', 'spooky', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'house', 'film', 'shifts', 'back', 'forth', 'revealing', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'Grudge', 'more', 'intriguing', 'production', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'clever', 'camera', 'tricks', 'substituting', 'CGI-animated', 'ghosts', 'spectres', 'However', 'film', 'predictable', 'very', 'end', 'even', 'Shimizu', 'driver', 'seat', 'once', 'again', 'surprising', 'how', 'much', 'Americanized', 'version', 'comparison', 'original', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'creepy', 'solid', 'performance', 'Gellar', 'hard', 'seeing', 'helpless', 'damsal', 'years', 'watching', 'kick', 'vampire', 'end', 'Grudge', 'disappointing', 'mainstream', 'teen-aimed', 'thriller', 'deliver', 'unrated', 'director', 'cut', 'more', 'graphic', 'footage', 'still', 'worth', 'avoiding', 'long', 'time', 'horror', 'fans']",N/A
872702,A3UH3X6PZ7WCWG,B0006SGYL0,"Nicholas Rog ""Zombie Fearer""","[1, 2]","Having only heard disappointing reviews about ""The Grudge"", I went into this film with very low expectations.  I had remembered the television previews and decided that I would watch this film if for nothing else, than at least to see what all of the creepy images had to do with.  To my disbelief, this film actually had a decent plot and was told in an interesting enough manner, to keep me fully attentive during the over-drawn portions of the film(and there are many).The film takes place in Tokyo and we are immediatly introduced to Karen(Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her boyfriend Doug.  They are foreign exchange students attending college and adapting to their new surroundings.  Karen is a social worker and is sent on her first case.  She is to take care of an elderly woman, struggling from what the doctors believe to be dementia.  Well, they are wrong.  As Karen finds out, there is something very wrong with the house this woman is living in and KAren apparently feels it the moment she walks in.  After a hair-raising evening, Karen is sent to a hospital so that she can be kept close watch on.  Oddly enough, the horror and images Karen saw in the house are now following her and won't leave her alone.  In fact, these images are following everyone that has visited the house, including the detectives sent in to see what was going on.  Why?  Did something happen in that house years ago??  Who is the little boy, that is just waaaaaaay too creepy???These are the questions that will be answered throughout the remainder of the film.""The Grudge"" does a pretty good job of keeping the viewer rather tense and on the egde of their seat.  This film is another example of the Japanese horror film gone AMerican and I am very curious to see the original Japanese version of this film, as I feel that it would rely much less on the special effects for the scares.  No gore in this film and although the images are scary, our two villians are a little Japanese boy and his mother----not really the sort of folks that will give you nightmares.  It was a good decision to tell this story in non-linear form, as the plot would probably have been much duller and predictable had they not.All in all, this is a decent film, certainly worth a viewing.  Not suitable for children as the depictions of ghosts are probably going to keep them up nights.Enjoy!",3,"""We were able to save the house""",1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,2356,"['Having', 'only', 'heard', 'disappointing', 'reviews', 'Grudge', 'went', 'film', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'had', 'remembered', 'television', 'previews', 'decided', 'would', 'watch', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'least', 'see', 'what', 'creepy', 'images', 'had', 'do', 'disbelief', 'film', 'actually', 'had', 'decent', 'plot', 'was', 'told', 'interesting', 'enough', 'manner', 'keep', 'fully', 'attentive', 'over-drawn', 'portions', 'film', 'are', 'many', '.The', 'film', 'place', 'Tokyo', 'are', 'immediatly', 'introduced', 'Karen', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'boyfriend', 'Doug', 'are', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'students', 'attending', 'college', 'adapting', 'new', 'surroundings', 'Karen', 'social', 'worker', 'sent', 'first', 'case', 'take', 'care', 'elderly', 'woman', 'struggling', 'what', 'doctors', 'believe', 'be', 'dementia', 'Well', 'are', 'wrong', 'Karen', 'out', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'house', 'woman', 'living', 'KAren', 'apparently', 'moment', 'hair-raising', 'evening', 'Karen', 'sent', 'hospital', 'can', 'be', 'kept', 'close', 'watch', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'horror', 'images', 'Karen', 'saw', 'house', 'are', 'now', 'following', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alone', 'fact', 'images', 'are', 'following', 'everyone', 'visited', 'house', 'including', 'detectives', 'sent', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Why', 'Did', 'something', 'happen', 'house', 'years', 'ago', 'Who', 'little', 'boy', 'just', 'waaaaaaay', 'too', 'creepy', 'are', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'answered', 'remainder', 'film', 'Grudge', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'rather', 'tense', 'egde', 'seat', 'film', 'example', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'gone', 'AMerican', 'am', 'very', 'curious', 'see', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'film', 'feel', 'would', 'rely', 'much', 'less', 'special', 'effects', 'scares', 'gore', 'film', 'images', 'are', 'scary', 'two', 'villians', 'are', 'little', 'Japanese', 'boy', 'mother', 'not', 'really', 'sort', 'folks', 'will', 'give', 'nightmares', 'was', 'good', 'decision', 'tell', 'story', 'non-linear', 'form', 'plot', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'duller', 'predictable', 'had', 'not.All', 'decent', 'film', 'certainly', 'viewing', 'Not', 'suitable', 'children', 'depictions', 'ghosts', 'are', 'probably', 'going', 'keep', 'up', 'nights.Enjoy']",N/A

The movie does have several good qualities to it. It is easier to follow than Ju-On and it is easier to keep track of who are the characters. It doesn't have the same creepy feel to it that Ju-On had and some of the jumps come off as comical instead of scary. There are a couple of good scenes that will make you jump in your seat, and it isn't a waste of money to rent or even buy it. Sarah Michelle Gellar is good in the movie, but nothing to write home about. Overall, I would say that if you haven't seen Ju-On then you will like the Grudge.

It is a fun movie and not as violent as Ju-On, which I believe was rated R, but it never really gets into your head the way Ju-On managed to creep you out. If you compare it to The Ring (another American remake), it doesn't stand too well because The Ring was able to live up to the original. Still, I would recommend the movie if you want something to watch late at night, with the doors locked and a big bowl of popcorn.

872717,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,B0006SGYL0,"Raj ""rajivsreviews""","[3, 7]","This review refers to the theatrical release of the movie.I was really interesting in seeing this movie when it came out, because I enjoyed watching ""The Grudge"". However, after actually watching it, I felt really disappointed.The basic plot of the Grudge 2 revolves around 3 storylines:1)In Chicago, a woman named Trish moves into the house of her fianc&eacute;e and his two children. After a while, Jake (one of the children) sees a mysterious stranger move into an apartment in their floor. Soon after the stranger moves in, Jake's family somehow get affected and start behaving hostile towards one another.2)After the first movie, we see Sarah Michelle Gellar's character Karen, secured in a hospital and being treated on. Back in the U.S., Karen's mother forces Karen's sister Aubrey to see Karen in Tokyo. Aubrey visits Japan and wants to find out exactly what happened to her sister to change her, and starts to investigate on the house.3)Three high school students, Allison, Vanessa and Miyuki, dare Allison to spend time in the haunted house, in order to join their group. Vanessa and Miyuki don't believe the house is really haunted and decide to play a prank on Allison in the house. However, they all get affected by the curse of the house, but can they escape the deadly curse?Although ""The Grudge 2"" did have some scary moments, it hardly contained any plot. I liked the idea of the 3 different storylines coming together in the end (since I have not seen the original Japanese version), but there is no explanation given as to why the Grudge spread, or if there is any way to stop it. We are just mentioned that it spreads, and it won't stop! This is a big disappointment because I was hoping that Aubrey would be able to find a way from Kayako spreading her grudge everywhere. In the end of the movie, you find yourself wondering if it was really worth watching the sequel, as nothing is revealed. Furthermore, some of the scenes are just confusing, such as: a) who is this person Nate that Trish talks with on the phone, and why does her fianc&eacute;e freak out over it? (What is the point of that scene anyway) b) When Allison goes to see her counselor, her counselor mentions that she too went into the house. So why doesn't the counselor get attacked by the Grudge and turn all ghost like and blue? She seems perfectly fine.So, even though I didn't find this movie completely bad, it did not par to my expectations at all. The cast acted really well actually, but with the given storyline, you won't find yourself attached to any of the characters. Therefore, if you want to see this movie just to get a kick out of it, then you will enjoy it, but don't expect it to make any sense.",3,"Good in suspense, but horrible in it's storyline",1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,2703,"['review', 'theatrical', 'release', 'movie.I', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Grudge', 'However', 'actually', 'watching', 'felt', 'really', 'disappointed.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Grudge', '2', 'revolves', '3', 'storylines:1', 'Chicago', 'woman', 'named', 'Trish', 'house', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'two', 'children', 'while', 'Jake', 'one', 'children', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'move', 'apartment', 'floor', 'Soon', 'stranger', 'moves', 'Jake', 'family', 'somehow', 'get', 'affected', 'start', 'behaving', 'hostile', 'towards', 'one', 'another.2', 'first', 'movie', 'see', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'character', 'Karen', 'secured', 'hospital', 'being', 'treated', 'Back', 'U.S.', 'Karen', 'mother', 'Karen', 'sister', 'Aubrey', 'see', 'Karen', 'Tokyo', 'Aubrey', 'Japan', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'sister', 'change', 'investigate', 'house.3', 'Three', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Allison', 'Vanessa', 'Miyuki', 'dare', 'Allison', 'spend', 'time', 'haunted', 'house', 'order', 'join', 'group', 'Vanessa', 'Miyuki', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'house', 'really', 'haunted', 'decide', 'play', 'prank', 'Allison', 'house', 'However', 'get', 'affected', 'curse', 'house', 'can', 'escape', 'deadly', 'curse', 'Grudge', '2', 'did', 'have', 'scary', 'moments', 'hardly', 'contained', 'plot', 'liked', 'idea', '3', 'different', 'storylines', 'coming', 'together', 'end', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'explanation', 'given', 'why', 'Grudge', 'spread', 'way', 'stop', 'are', 'just', 'mentioned', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'big', 'disappointment', 'was', 'hoping', 'Aubrey', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'Kayako', 'spreading', 'grudge', 'everywhere', 'end', 'movie', 'find', 'wondering', 'was', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'sequel', 'nothing', 'revealed', 'Furthermore', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'confusing', 'such', 'who', 'person', 'Nate', 'Trish', 'talks', 'phone', 'why', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'freak', 'out', 'What', 'point', 'scene', 'anyway', 'b', 'When', 'Allison', 'see', 'counselor', 'counselor', 'mentions', 'too', 'went', 'house', 'So', 'why', ""n't"", 'counselor', 'get', 'attacked', 'Grudge', 'turn', 'ghost', 'blue', 'perfectly', 'fine.So', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'completely', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'par', 'expectations', 'cast', 'acted', 'really', 'well', 'actually', 'given', 'storyline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'attached', 'characters', 'Therefore', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'just', 'get', 'kick', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'make', 'sense']",N/A

The jump factor is high, and these shocks and scares (bar the initial dealings with Yoko, the care-worker) never feel tired or predictable. It's thanks directly to the expert direction of Takashi Shimizu that this is the case.Initially, the American Exchange Students-moving-to-Japan plot element feels like a cheat - divisive and base, and a way of moving the action of this remake closer to the tone of the original movie - but happily, an above-average script (for the genre) and a lack of focus on the Westernisation of the lead characters means that this actually works more in the movie's favour. Karen, Doug, the Williams family and the  Kirk family all feel more isolated and alone in their nightmare because of the culture barrier, and not because of some run-of-the-mill horror movie aspects.Visual effects are minimalist and achingly stylish, the scene with the security cameras and the final black-and-white expository flashbacks are some really marvellous examples of what can be established when real talent sits behind the camera, unencumbered by a desire to show off. Affecting and moving, the washed-out colours and ingenious creatures and set-pieces provide a very sympathetic (almost forgiving!) backdrop for some solid, if unstellar, performances from the cast.All in all, this really is an excellent effort, and, when taken in-context with its genre peers (The Ring, Dark Water), it's probably the best of the remakes, too. If `Candyman' was the best horror movie of the Ninties, then `The Grudge' is certainly a contender for that crown now.

Especially after friends went to see it in the theater and claimed it was one of the scariest movies they'd seen in years. Wow - should be good. Think again. Turned out to be a joke of a horror film - an utter waste of time. Maybe the big screen, the dark theater, being at the late show at night, and perhaps the full moon and high tides had something to do with how they felt about ""The Grudge"". For me, this movie was slow, predictable, and down-right disappointing. I don't always need blood and guts in my HORROR movies, but sometimes it sure helps. Ask me what I think a classic scary/horror movie is and I'll respond with ""The Exercist"", ""Halloween"", ""Psycho"", ""Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""When A Stranger Calls"", ""Final Destination"", or any of the old classic Vincent Price films from 30-40 years ago. ""The Grudge"" being an (Asian) horror classic? Give me a break - this kind of innocent suspenseful horror is weak in my book. Watch this movie and tell me your horrified of the little white-faced kid with the shiney black balloon in his mouth. It just wasn't scary! To top it off, director Shimizu felt this movie was so good - he imported half a dozen American actors to make a 2nd (U.S.) version. The first version being ""Ju-on""... also a major disappointment. The two movies are 90% the same... with the exception of the American actors. The same house is used, as is the same sister's apartment, the care center, grocery store, elevator, not to mention script and plot. There is no soundtrack to speak of throughout the movie. The director relies on objects jumping in front of the screen at just the right time accompanied by screeching violins. Sarah ""Buffy"" Michelle Gellar (""Scooby Doo"", ""Cruel Intentions"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") continues her roll of choosing below average scripts. Bill Pullman (""While You Were Sleeping"", ""Casper"", ""Newsies"", ""Spy Games"", ""Independence Day"", ""Lake Placid"") on the other hand, is distinguished as a leading 2nd man... and I was disappointed at his role here (very little dialogue and screen time).

The people at Ghost House (the company behind this) should allow the professional Japanese creators to do their thing.  The only -  and I mean ONLY thing Ghost House need to do to make it a success here in USA is to be sure it is in English and foot the money.  That's it.  Personally, I dont mind reading subtitles.  A note to Ghost House - listen to your audience and give us an apology for this horrible sequel to a masterpiece and give us The Grudge 3 - but this time please let the Writers write, and the director direct.  Hollywood needs to just step back and watch and learn on the remakes of all Asian cinema (if remakes are necessary at all in the first place).  Ultimately - more sales and more money..and you can be proud of being a part of a great movie again.  Remember that feeling??Trust me - if you scratched your head everytime something did not make sense in this movie - we all would be bald by now.  Onto the packaging of the DVD - overall great.  I would suggest that they add Spanish to the languages.  Many DVDs are now coming without a scene selection menu sheet - they used to be on the inside and on the left.  I personally liked using them.

Everytime at every scene that had someone alone you knew something was going to pop up and kill the person. I just got sick of seeing things pop up after every scene. I didn't even have a second to figure out the story line because i was interupted every 8 seconds because something new would pop out. That stupid little girl that had some broncitus or throat disease got on my nerves within eight minutes of the film, and the little kid in the movie was nothing but a disturbed little boy who needed much attention. If i were you, who ever is reading this or wants to see this movie, i recommend you rent it and decide on your own. i was disaspointed becuase it was presented as a Pathetic Teen Movie. If you thought American Pie is your favorite movie which is pathetic than you will think this movie is your god, because thats how horrible and  mediocre this film is. Its boring, and it lacks orginality. The girl constantly killing people at will gave me the impression that the filmmakers wanted to make a film out of the life story of Aileen Wuornos, that girl in the movie ""Monster"". But this time she just kills random people because they set there foot in her doorway.....lame...... I expected better from Sam Riami. Yet he is still a good director and this is just one of his flops. Well every director has at least one flop on their resume, excpet for Martin Scorcese. I would say not one of his films are a flop.

Yet Gellar actually did not do too bad of a job. But this movie is not neccessarily meant for adults. I mean, the special effects for one thing were not spectacular. Like The Ring, the effects were indeed creepy but not great. The plot is all right but at the end it gets shady, and the ending itself was kind of a cliff- hanger and I'm one of those viewers whom don't like cliff- hanger endings that much. If you start a story, you should end it as well in my opinion. Overall it is meant to be a teen thriller, one that does not have great talent and special effects but of average quality like they use in teen filcks. And there were one or two other questions they wouldn't answer exactly. It wasn't exactly a mature film. But nonetheless I would recommend it for a night when you just want to relax and get creeped out, because indeed you will. So I give it three stars as a fun horror movie, not great, but not at all horrible either.I don't want to give anything away so I will merely say that The Grudge is about Karen, an exchange student (Gellar) whom is working in Tokyo, Japan as a house nurse to a sick old woman, and soon she figures out there is something wrong with the house.

I tell you this only so that you will know when you will be able to take a quick refreshment and/or restroom break and not miss anything.  It also pretty much underscores the modus operandi of this film, which is ""don't bother with something new when something old will do.""  For although ""The Grudge"" is a remake of a recent Japanese film (""Ju-On,"" made by the same director, Takashi Shimizu), there really isn't anything here that we haven't seen hundreds of times before in haunted house movies made east of the International Date Line.The bland Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a young foreign exchange student living in Japan who volunteers as a care worker in her spare time.  When she is sent to the home of a strangely ""lethargic"" woman, Gellar begins to suspect that there is something not quite right about the residence.  From then on, she and several other people, who also share a connection with the house, are haunted by a ghoulish specter who keeps popping up in the strangest places and at the most inopportune moments to exact her revenge for being done away with in an untimely manner (although none of the people she pesters had anything to do with her demise).Although there are a few mildly suspenseful moments scattered throughout the film, ""The Grudge"" is simply too derivative and too hackneyed to register much of an impact on our psyches, with a great deal of its imagery ripped-off from that seminal horror film ""Carnival of Souls.""  The story makes very little sense when you start to analyze it seriously and, after all the huffing and puffing to arrive at a stunning climax, the ending deflates like a slowly leaking balloon.  I haven't seen the original version, so I have no idea how it compares to this one.  But I can hardly imagine it was anywhere near as undistinguished and lackluster as this one is (or else why remake it?).

872730,AL5BWQ7N6MLQK,B0006SGYL0,"Ronin Dave ""Far be it for Logic to Stand in t...","[16, 21]","Japan has a long, ghostly tradition with beings from beyond the grave. Nemerous stories and legends  in Japan of these otherworldly visitors abound. Ghosts often play key roles in Kabuki theater and were a favorite though perhaps somewhat overly-used character by Kabuki playwrights. Many of the ghosts that appear in plays and stories are females seeking revenge for wrongs done to them during their lifetime typically by cruel, heartless husbands.In the old ghost stories, vengeful Japanese ghosts would continue haunt their victims until they went insane, died, or at least made some form of restitution to appease the angry spirits. Some Japanese ghosts were born out of tragedy or sorrow and would haunt any person who came near. These spirits were particularly feared because they represented a danger to all unless they were somehow put to rest.Although I knew about the horrific nature of old Japanese ghosts, I had thought modern Japanese ghosts would be more polite and demur. I had imagined a modern Japanese ghost timidly coming up to someone and saying ""Suimasen (Excuse me)! BOO! Gomen naisai (I'm sorry)!"" before whisking away. ""The Grudge"" (2004) showed me how wrong I was about modern Japanese phantoms.""The Grudge,"" starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fame, depicts a haunting by very impolite spirits. Gellar plays an American student nurse in Tokyo who accidentally gets involved with a haunted house that has the nasty habit of killing visitors. The ghosts of the house were victims of a tragedy and now they rudely kill anyone who comes in contact with them.The spirits' motivation for killing is explained at the beginning of the film in a brief written prologue which states: ""when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is left behind.""For Western audiences it may seem unusual that the two main ghostly antagonists who having been innocent victims of a violent death themselves would seek to cause the death of another innocent person. This flies in the face of a Western audience's sense of justice and fairness.In many Western ghost stories, ghosts despite their spookiness are often motivated by the same things as living people namely the pursuit of justice for wrongdoings. The ghost of a murdered person will seek vengeance on the person or persons responsible for their death.If a ghost is malevolent, it often turns out they were a bad person in life - as in the back-story to the main ghost character in the ""Poltergeist"" (1982-1986) movies.To understand the nature of the supernatural entity of ""The Grudge,"" one has to understand Japanese belief in spirits and the supernatural.In the book ""Ghosts and the Japanese: Cultural Experience in Japanese Death Legends"" by Michiko Iwasaka, there is a passage which is a direct echo of the opening lines of the movie:""Anyone who dies under great emotional stress creates an energy which is not easily dissipated; these yurei [ghosts], thus, have an impact on the local environment...""This type of spirit is called a ""goryo"" - vengeful ghost. A goryo, however, is less like a consciously aware ghost that plots revenge like those featured in Kabuki plays and which would be more familiar to Western audiences. A goryo is more like the energy of the emotion created at the time of death. And to some degree it represents the unconscious mind free of the limitations and morals of the conscious analytic side.Formal belief of goryo can be traced to the Heien Period (794-1185) when goryo were believed to be the angry spirits of political enemies that had died in exile or had been executed. The noted scholar Sugawara-no-Michizane became one such goryo. Through guileful manipulations, his enemies at the Imperial Court engineered his banishment from Kyoto. Sugawara died in extreme sorrow while in exile. Shortly after his death, a number of natural disasters occurred from droughts and epidemics to lightening strikes. It was believed to be caused by the angry spirit of Sugawara. To appease his goryo, Sugawara was given ceremonial promotion at the Imperial Court and eventually he was made into a god-spirit whom modern-day students pray to for success on their exams.Goryo were vengeful spirits from the aristocracy who like Sugiwara have the power to affect the very seasons. Another more commonly experienced type was onryo. While less powerful than the goryo, the onryo were the ghosts that kept Japanese of then and now frightened out of their wits. Onryo are typically depicted with wild unkempt hair in a white burial kimono.Although onryo could be either male or female, the most popular onryo were women. Often powerless while in life, these female onryo wielded great power in death. They would wreak vengeance on husbands and lovers who spurned or hurt them in life usually by driving them mad with fear.Director Takashi Shimizu has built on this old concept to create a deadly onryo of a very frightening ghostly Mother and Son duo. ""The Grudge"" is an American remake of the original Japanese thriller ""Ju-on"" (2003). ""Ju-on"" is Shimizu's horror franchise. ""Ju-on"" grew out of a short TV story to become a successful and scary theater-release movie which was followed by a sequel. Famed Spiderman director, Sam Ramie, who helped produce the American remake thought ""Ju-on"" to be one of the scariest movies he had ever seen.""The Grudge"" opened in America during the Halloween season last fall but it has only recently opened in Japan. One notable difference is the inclusion of a few extra violent moments that were left out in the American version in order for the movie to keep a PG-13 rating in the States.Overall there's not much of story. Some people die, then some other people die. Most of the film is just one scare after another with little character development or plot. ""The Grudge"" is more like a series of creepy vignettes strung together to make a film. However, these vignettes are quite scary. Its the cultural nuance of the goryo/onryo-type spirit that ""The Grudge"" represents and the genuinely frightening moments that makes the film an interesting experience for Japan-o-philes and horror fans alike.On the Scare-O-Meter, ""The Grudge"" rates about 4 out 5 Screams.On Plot, it rates about 2 stars out of 5; however the concept behind the movie rates about a 4.",3,Japanese Ghosts Hold a

I was dead wrong. This movie recycles so much of what happened in the first movie that nothing ends up being scary.They even reused the ""under the bed-covers"" idea!!!The shining light of the movie was Sarah Michelle Gellar, and her cameo is very short. Amber Tamblyn provided a solid character and her acting was decent. Overall, she did a fair job with the material she was given.The WORST aspect of the film would be the dumbing down of how the curse gets you. In the first movie, you were instantly cursed if you set foot inside the house...but, NOW, we are informed that it ISN'T the house and it has nothing to do with setting foot ANYWHERE...but they fail to actually tell the viewers WHAT is causing the curse after that revelation is made.This movie was dissapointing and the ending was horrible. I didn't understand the whole Jennifer Beals storyline...Was she cheating on her fiance/boyfriend/i dont know what to call him?? Had the grudge taken over her and caused her to kill him or was that her own malice towards him? I didn't understand it.I felt bad for the young boy in this movie for having to endure the grudge too-i think there should be some sort of age limit-don't kill kids in movies under a certain age...it's just distasteful in my opinion.

872733,A387BD735MI50R,B0006SGYL0,R. Schultz,"[0, 2]","This film is an uninspired ""Son of"" the original Grudge. It tries to go back and pick-up where the first Grudge left off. It features some flashbacks to reacquaint the viewer with the shocking double murder that loosed the vengeance in the first place. Then it does its stuff, making us fear the terrible disjointed wraith with the veiling strings of black hair - around every shadowy corner, under every cover.The vengeful spirit does in fact become almost ubiquitous here. This film shows that its malignance is capable of transferring to and following people everywhere - even to towns and cities in the U.S. No one is safe.But the scares are all calculated copies of the inherent dread built up in the first film. There isn't much plot in this Grudge. The threat just appears on schedule - now here - now there. So unless you have a lot of time on your hands, you might do best to watch the original Grudge and be satisfied with just that much of the fearsome specter.However in case you should decide to check this II out - a word of clarification. Like the first Grudge, this movie was produced as a quasi-joint project involving both Japanese and American actors. But two of the American leads in the film look so much alike, I was confused and distracted from what little plot there was until I backtracked and saw my mistake.  The actress who plays Sarah Michelle Geller's sister, and the actress who plays the academy student taunted into going into the heart of darkness in the evil house, are made to look so much alike (identical hairdos, similar adolescent innocent faces), I initially confused and conflated the two. Be alerted though - these are TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE, involved in TWO DIFFERENT strands of suspense.Perhaps this similarity was also calculated by Director Shimizu. He might have wanted to turn the tables on a common Western stereotype and show us that it's really Caucasians who all look alike.",2,Pale Shadow,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1925,"['film', 'uninspired', 'Son', 'original', 'Grudge', 'go', 'back', 'pick-up', 'where', 'first', 'Grudge', 'left', 'off', 'flashbacks', 'reacquaint', 'viewer', 'shocking', 'double', 'murder', 'loosed', 'vengeance', 'first', 'place', 'Then', 'stuff', 'making', 'fear', 'terrible', 'disjointed', 'wraith', 'veiling', 'strings', 'black', 'hair', 'shadowy', 'corner', 'cover.The', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'fact', 'become', 'almost', 'ubiquitous', 'here', 'film', 'malignance', 'capable', 'transferring', 'following', 'people', 'everywhere', 'even', 'towns', 'cities', 'U.S.', 'No', 'one', 'scares', 'are', 'calculated', 'copies', 'inherent', 'dread', 'built', 'up', 'first', 'film', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'Grudge', 'threat', 'just', 'schedule', 'now', 'here', 'now', 'there', 'So', 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'hands', 'might', 'do', 'best', 'watch', 'original', 'Grudge', 'be', 'satisfied', 'just', 'much', 'fearsome', 'specter.However', 'case', 'should', 'decide', 'check', 'II', 'out', 'word', 'clarification', 'first', 'Grudge', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'quasi-joint', 'project', 'involving', 'Japanese', 'American', 'actors', 'two', 'American', 'leads', 'film', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'confused', 'distracted', 'what', 'little', 'plot', 'was', 'backtracked', 'saw', 'mistake', 'actress', 'who', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Geller', 'sister', 'actress', 'who', 'academy', 'student', 'taunted', 'going', 'heart', 'darkness', 'evil', 'house', 'are', 'made', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'identical', 'hairdos', 'similar', 'adolescent', 'innocent', 'initially', 'confused', 'conflated', 'two', 'Be', 'alerted', 'are', 'TWO', 'DIFFERENT', 'PEOPLE', 'involved', 'TWO', 'DIFFERENT', 'strands', 'suspense.Perhaps', 'similarity', 'was', 'also', 'calculated', 'Director', 'Shimizu', 'might', 'have', 'wanted', 'turn', 'tables', 'common', 'Western', 'stereotype', 'show', 'really', 'Caucasians', 'who', 'look', 'alike']",N/A
872734,AGSWTH7SP2256,B0006SGYL0,R. W. Rasband,"[5, 6]","I am at a loss to explain a few of the negative reviews ""The Grudge"" got from some critics (like Roger Ebert, who should know better.) Granted, it's not a recognizably instant classic like ""The Ring"", so ""The Grudge"" probably suffers by comparison in the minds of some.  And its intricate story structure and downbeat themes may put off some people.  But ""The Grudge"" is, on its own terms, a very effective exercise in horror that is all the more terrifying because of its restraint.The movie is told in parallel story lines that move back and forth in time, so you have to pay attention.  Its vision of history as an eternal, cyclical nightmare from which it is impossible to awaken may not be comforting to straight-forward, problem-solving Americans.  But it is very Japanese and has a haunting relevance nowadays.  As someone once said, ""you may be through with the past; but the past is not through with you.""  More than one critic complained that this movie ""didn't go anywhere""; that it was just an excuse to string together a sequence of very creepy images.  Well, the images are very creepy indeed (including an elevator ride that will haunt your dreams.)  But not being able to escape or move forward is very much the point.  Unlike a lot of American films, ""The Grudge"" doesn't feel obligated to explain everything and spell out every plot point.  You have to fill in some of the gaps, and tricking you into getting your imagination working overtime is a good strategy for the filmmakers.Sarah Michelle Gellar does a fine, quietly touching acting job as a good-hearted American girl who to tries to fight the evil but is in way over her head.  She's plucky in a vulnerable way; it's very different from the ass-kicking Buffy we all know and love.  Anyone who still says she's limited as an actress is full of crap.  Director Shimizu has a nicely poetic touch that make the horror all the more awful.  I was exhilarated after watching this movie.

True, we get a good remake once in a while (Dawn of the Dead being a very good one, The Ring being a decent one), but more often than not, the films are just badly done. Especially when remaking good asian horror flicks.Not that the original Grudge was all that great. But at least that one displayed a few very memorable scares. This new remake, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar as a nurse working for a family in Tokyo in a house that just happens to be haunted, offers no scare, no thrills. No images that will come back to haunt your dreams. No silly jumps or scare. Nothing.It's hard to see such a good cast trapped in such a horridly boring flick. We've come to expect much more of young actors like Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr and Clea DuVall. This cast had a great potential. So why does the movie fizzle like it does?Well, a lot has to do with the film's structure. True, it's fun to catch a flick that does not have a linear structure, but such a movie needs to be well planned and thought out. The Grudge is so disjointed and so freely moves back and forth in time that it becomes a headache for the viewer. And the fact that every new section is seperated by a few seconds of darkness ruins whatever suspense had been built up to that point.I was expecting much more from The Grudge, especially when considering the people involved in front and behind the camera (Sam Raimi being one of the producers).

872750,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0006SGYL0,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 1]","""The Grudge"" is the American remake of Japan's ""Ju-On: The Grudge"", and while it's nowhere near on par with remakes like ""Dark Water"", ""The Ring"" or ""The Ring Two"", it does stand pretty well on its own.  In sharp contrast to the Ring/Ringu situation though (I can't compare the two ""Dark Water""s, as I still haven't gotten to the 2002 original), ""The Grudge"" is pretty much a shot-for-shot remake of ""Ju-On"", bringing little new to the table.As with the original, ""The Grudge"" follows the premise of a legend in Japanese folklore (apparantly really a part of that tradition and not just made up for the movie) - a person who dies an unnatural death, in the grip of a rage, will sometimes become a ghost known as a Ju-On.  These spirits are violent and vengeful and, judging from the ""Ju-On"" and ""Grudge"" movies, seem to act not necesarily in accordance with the kinds of people they were when alive, but lashing out quite indiscriminately in rage over the injustice of their own demise.  They seem incapable of differentiating between the living who they would have reason to bear anger against, and just the living in general.  Those who are killed by a Ju-On become one themselves, and the curse grows.At the risk of repeating myself from when I wrote about ""Ju-On"" in its own entry, the troubles begin when a young home health care worker (who makes her rounds caring for various frail and incapacitated people in their own homes) enters a house to care for a woman who's recently moved with her family into a new home with a dark past.  Invesigating strange noises coming from upstairs, she discovers an unusual little boy behind a boarded-up wall.  And thus the first Ju-On makes his appearance, and the weirdness and darkness begins.""The Grudge"" has many of the same strengths and many of the same weaknesses as ""Ju-On"", which is fitting I suppose because most of the time they're the same movie, just with different actors (although some from the original reprise their roles here) and spoken in different languages.  As with the first one, there are some pretty implausible actions and reactions on the parts of the human characters in here; I found it overall to be less pronounced in this remake though.  Although both movies unfold in much the same style with regards to timeframes, I found this one easier to make sense of - it may be because I saw the Japanese one first and knew what to expect this time.  Or it may be because when ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" was shot, it was with the expectation that most Asian viewers would have already had a chance to see ""Ju-On: The Curse 1"" and ""Ju-On: The Curse 2"", the two Japanese made-for-tv-movies which ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" was itself a remake of (or, apparantly, it could be viewed as a kind of sequel if one was so inclined; I haven't had a chance to watch those two yet).The overall production values in this movie are very good but the ones in ""Ju-On"" were a bit better, except for the special effects.  Here ""The Grudge"" wins out by a fair margin with truly great effects.  Both movies feature the same freakishly disturbing sounds made by the Ju-On ghosrs.  Those bizarre, utterly unnatural noises are just plain scary.If one was just going on ""The Grudge"" and ""Ju-On"" you could really just pick either one and miss very little.  However, there's a catch - both movies's sequels are better, and the sequels actually follow completely different storylines from one another.  And they're each better served by seeing their respective predecessor first.  So personally I'd recommend both ""Grudge"" and Ju-On"", although you'll probably want to watch them some time apart rather than one just a few days after the other.  They're both good movies, but I wish they'd made at least a few significant changes in this one; it's a lost opportunity that was, thankfully, more than made up for by the sequels being so far apart.",3,"Good Movie, Nicely Made, But They Changed Hardly Anything From The Original",1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,3873,"['Grudge', 'American', 'remake', 'Japan', 'Ju-On', 'Grudge', 'nowhere', 'near', 'par', 'remakes', 'Dark', 'Water', 'Ring', 'Ring', 'Two', 'stand', 'pretty', 'well', 'own', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'Ring/Ringu', 'situation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'Dark', 'Water', 's', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', '2002', 'original', 'Grudge', 'pretty', 'much', 'shot-for-shot', 'remake', 'Ju-On', 'bringing', 'little', 'new', 'table.As', 'original', 'Grudge', 'premise', 'legend', 'Japanese', 'folklore', 'apparantly', 'really', 'part', 'tradition', 'not', 'just', 'made', 'up', 'movie', 'person', 'who', 'unnatural', 'death', 'grip', 'rage', 'will', 'sometimes', 'become', 'ghost', 'known', 'Ju-On', 'spirits', 'are', 'violent', 'vengeful', 'judging', 'Ju-On', 'Grudge', 'movies', 'seem', 'act', 'not', 'necesarily', 'accordance', 'kinds', 'people', 'were', 'when', 'alive', 'lashing', 'out', 'quite', 'indiscriminately', 'rage', 'injustice', 'own', 'demise', 'seem', 'incapable', 'differentiating', 'living', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'reason', 'bear', 'anger', 'just', 'living', 'general', 'who', 'are', 'killed', 'Ju-On', 'become', 'one', 'curse', 'grows.At', 'risk', 'repeating', 'when', 'wrote', 'Ju-On', 'own', 'entry', 'troubles', 'begin', 'when', 'young', 'home', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'who', 'rounds', 'caring', 'various', 'frail', 'incapacitated', 'people', 'own', 'homes', 'house', 'care', 'woman', 'who', 'recently', 'moved', 'family', 'new', 'home', 'dark', 'past', 'Invesigating', 'strange', 'noises', 'coming', 'upstairs', 'unusual', 'little', 'boy', 'boarded-up', 'wall', 'thus', 'first', 'Ju-On', 'appearance', 'weirdness', 'darkness', 'begins', 'Grudge', 'many', 'same', 'strengths', 'many', 'same', 'Ju-On', 'fitting', 'suppose', 'most', 'time', ""'re"", 'same', 'movie', 'just', 'different', 'actors', 'original', 'reprise', 'roles', 'here', 'spoken', 'different', 'languages', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'pretty', 'implausible', 'actions', 'reactions', 'parts', 'human', 'characters', 'here', 'found', 'overall', 'be', 'less', 'pronounced', 'remake', 'movies', 'unfold', 'much', 'same', 'style', 'regards', 'timeframes', 'found', 'one', 'easier', 'make', 'sense', 'may', 'be', 'saw', 'Japanese', 'one', 'first', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'when', 'Ju-On', 'Grudge', 'was', 'shot', 'was', 'expectation', 'most', 'Asian', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'Ju-On', 'Curse', '1', 'Ju-On', 'Curse', '2', 'two', 'Japanese', 'made-for-tv-movies', 'Ju-On', 'Grudge', 'was', 'remake', 'apparantly', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'kind', 'sequel', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'inclined', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'two', 'yet', '.The', 'overall', 'production', 'values', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'ones', 'Ju-On', 'were', 'bit', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'Here', 'Grudge', 'out', 'fair', 'margin', 'truly', 'great', 'effects', 'movies', 'feature', 'same', 'freakishly', 'disturbing', 'sounds', 'made', 'Ju-On', 'ghosrs', 'bizarre', 'utterly', 'unnatural', 'noises', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'scary.If', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'Grudge', 'Ju-On', 'could', 'really', 'just', 'pick', 'one', 'miss', 'very', 'little', 'However', 'catch', 'movies', 'sequels', 'are', 'better', 'sequels', 'actually', 'follow', 'completely', 'different', 'storylines', 'one', ""'re"", 'better', 'served', 'seeing', 'respective', 'predecessor', 'first', 'So', 'personally', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Grudge', 'Ju-On', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'watch', 'time', 'apart', 'rather', 'one', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'other', ""'re"", 'good', 'movies', 'wish', ""'d"", 'made', 'least', 'few', 'significant', 'changes', 'one', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'was', 'thankfully', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'sequels', 'being', 'so', 'far', 'apart']",N/A

The preface is simply this, a movie has a beginning middle and an end. It has development and it moves, no matter how confined the actual settings are. If character development is not an issue (and it isn't generally in horror movies) then plot movement is vital. To be more specific it is vital to making a good horror movie.The grudge does not move. It does not plod either, but patiently instead walks constantly in the same circle, slightly alternating steps on each cycle. In effect this is a director's filmmaking exercise, taking the same elements of horror repeatedly and putting them in different containers. The sounds - including a sort of a Bjork Medulla-ish, throatal, moaning as children often make to prove they have a sore throat, isn't especially effective. The shadows are a little better in framing the suspense, but the small japanese house used as a setting is too symetrical and neat to be frightening.Being PG-13 there are no chills from gore or violence or shock, all action is cut away from at the last second to maximize the potential audience. Imagine the same effect as Aliens vs. Predator's rating minus the attractive face of Sanaa Lathan or laughably bad directing. So instead we are repeated to the same teases as AVP offered. All buildup, no payoff. No variety, no change of pace, and no characters with interesting enough personalities to break the mood.Our 'story' begins (or more accurately our stage is set) in a Japanese hotel room. A sudden suicide leaves a woman widowed, her husband having thrown himself over their balcony with no explanation or warning. From there the premise as explained in the trailers is played out. When someone dies in extreme agony the curse stays and all who encounter it are cursed. That's all. There are no Poltegiest of Hellraiser type developments. All we have are a series of excuses to show off the next scare tactic approxamitely every 15-20 minutes.This is not a movie.original review I wrote here: [...]",1,Not really a horror film,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,2122,"['prefaces', 'reviewing', 'grudge', 'will', 'hopefully', 'allay', 'concerns', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'reading', 'compare', 'notes', 'preface', 'simply', 'movie', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'development', 'matter', 'how', 'confined', 'actual', 'settings', 'are', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'issue', ""n't"", 'generally', 'horror', 'movies', 'then', 'plot', 'movement', 'vital', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'vital', 'making', 'good', 'horror', 'movie.The', 'grudge', 'not', 'move', 'not', 'plod', 'either', 'patiently', 'instead', 'walks', 'constantly', 'same', 'circle', 'slightly', 'alternating', 'steps', 'cycle', 'effect', 'director', 'filmmaking', 'exercise', 'taking', 'same', 'elements', 'horror', 'repeatedly', 'putting', 'different', 'containers', 'sounds', 'including', 'sort', 'Bjork', 'Medulla-ish', 'throatal', 'moaning', 'children', 'often', 'make', 'prove', 'have', 'sore', 'throat', ""n't"", 'especially', 'effective', 'shadows', 'are', 'little', 'better', 'framing', 'suspense', 'small', 'japanese', 'house', 'used', 'setting', 'too', 'symetrical', 'neat', 'be', 'frightening.Being', 'PG-13', 'are', 'chills', 'gore', 'violence', 'shock', 'action', 'cut', 'away', 'last', 'second', 'maximize', 'potential', 'audience', 'Imagine', 'same', 'effect', 'Aliens', 'vs', 'Predator', 'rating', 'attractive', 'face', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'laughably', 'bad', 'directing', 'So', 'instead', 'are', 'repeated', 'same', 'teases', 'AVP', 'offered', 'buildup', 'payoff', 'variety', 'change', 'pace', 'characters', 'interesting', 'enough', 'personalities', 'break', 'mood.Our', ""'story"", 'begins', 'more', 'accurately', 'stage', 'set', 'Japanese', 'hotel', 'room', 'sudden', 'suicide', 'woman', 'widowed', 'husband', 'having', 'thrown', 'balcony', 'explanation', 'warning', 'premise', 'explained', 'trailers', 'played', 'out', 'When', 'someone', 'extreme', 'agony', 'curse', 'stays', 'who', 'encounter', 'are', 'cursed', 'are', 'Poltegiest', 'Hellraiser', 'type', 'developments', 'have', 'are', 'series', 'excuses', 'show', 'off', 'next', 'scare', 'tactic', 'approxamitely', '15-20', 'minutes.This', 'not', 'movie.original', 'review', 'wrote', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A

The cinematography is perfectly dark and moody.  While this film definitely falls into the traditional haunted house horror genre, it is leaps and bounds above the norm.  The images in this film stay with you much like the ones in ""The Ring"" (an admittedly better and scarier film).  My wife and I were totally blown away by this film.I admit that I can be rather permissive in what I let my kids watch, but this is one film that in spite of it's PG-13 rating and lack of gore and violence, I would not let them see this film because I know the images would stay with them and frighten them for nights to come.

872764,A1NSRNG8YNTHXP,B0006SGYL0,TheXRAYest,"[5, 11]","Last evening I had the major disappointment of viewing this so-called horror movie, and it was way more HORRIBLE than horror. The only ""scary"" part was some weird sound that came out of the ""ghosts"" mouth - sort of like a frog croaking. I was scared alright - scared that the sad actors playing the roles of the ghosts were perhaps in need of medical attention. The entire movie was a bore, had no real storyline that made any sense whatsoever, the acting was mediocre at best, and it was hard to follow. It seemed to go backwards in time and then forward, and in either tense, it was difficult to follow. Perhaps in Japan it was considered scary, and if so maybe in that culture scary would be some freak who kills his wife and kid when he discovers his wife has a schoolgirl crush on her teacher, and then the freak/coward hangs himself. The untimely death of the wife and child then causes them to become freaky ghosts- the wife, who is a contorsionist, slithering down stairs like a snake, croaks like a frog, with stringy hair and bloodshot eyes, and the son looking deathly pale except for black eyeliner around his eyes and instead of croaking, he screeches like a cat. It then appeared that the authorities (ie. police), knew about the weird goings-on in the ""haunted house"", so in that case, why not demolish it. It was a pathetic, ugly house in the first place, so seeing that murders took place in it, just knock it down and go on with life. Instead of being afraid of the odd ghosts, the rest of the cast who were supposed to be scared to death or near-death should have just had a good laugh into their croaking and screeching faces, and then maybe the ghosts would realize how ridiculous they were, and just go away. The ending left me feeling empty as I had no idea why the police and medical personel would allow Karen into a morgue to what? see her dead boyfriend on a slab ??? , and since that was the case, why leave her alone in the morgue after she just went through such a tramatic experience in the haunted ugly house ??? Oh and lo and behold, just who materializes behind her but old bloodshot eyes herself complete with that ""scary"" croak voice. I still don't know what the Grudge is, and maybe Ju-on means grudge in Japanese, even so, did the ghosts have a grudge on whoever entered their house???

872765,A14R9ACX9TQVX7,B0006SGYL0,Thom Cuddy,"[1, 2]","First off, I thought this movie was okay. The acting was fine, and the pace of the story kept it from dragging too much. However, the basic idea is, well...stupid. According to the movie, Japan has a superstition that anyone who is murdered and dies in a way that involves great anger or sorrow (which should cover most deaths) ends up killing everyone who enters the house the death occurred in. If this were actually possible, I have to assume the Japanese government/police would have grown wise to this and torn down houses like the one this story focuses on. If you can accept that no one would ever catch on to this bit of the obvious in Japan, then the movie is enjoyable, to a point. This is one of those ""jigsaw"" movies that unfold out of chronological order, so you have to pay attention to the entire second half to understand why this particular story is the one being told.

There are some genuine jump moments (anytime Yuya Ozeki or Takako Fuji are in the frame) and the supporting cast is good (Ted Raimi as a social work facilitator not so good-he showed frustration almost constantly), but Gellar, as Karen Davis, just doesn't have broad enough shoulders to carry a film like this.  The phasing from story to story, so you could get the full picture of how insidious the hatred enveloping this house really is, was interesting.  I liked seeing all the concurrent stories that led up to the moment when Karen tried to burn down the house to kill the spirit.  I enjoyed Clea Duvall's portrayal of sadness and isolation at being in a foreign country, where hardly anyone spoke english.  Her growing frustration and withdrawal from her surroundings made her ultimate demise at the hands of the house very poignant.  But best of all was Yuya Ozeki as Toshio.  The child is beautiful when he looks normal, but put him in that white makeup, with the black eyes and sinisterly sad expression, and you have some really creepy moments when he's in frame.  Takako Fuji as Kayako was also creepy and weird.  Her face, it's almost plastic expressionlessness, was wonderfully scary to behold.  Her flexibility and disjointedness when she crawled down the stairs after Karen was astounding.  And how she got her hand under Gellar's hair on the back of her head in the shower is truly baffling.

The background story gave me chills because it left the impression of emotional child abuse; the woman gave evil residue to her daughter who (supposedly) was able to suppress it. I was left with the question &#34;How could anyone do that to their child?&#34; But then, in the real world, there are cases where women sacrifice their children to just about anything-even using them as a means to an income.

They pop up whenever and wherever they want, and never fail to send signals before they terrorize the victims with strange noise or something else.That means, you can read the pattern; once you do, you only wait for the next scary part to be delivered. The film becomes a series of set-pieces. They are cleverly staged, but they soon begin to be less and less shocking as the film goes on. The dark, brooding photography by Katsumi Yamagijima (famous for collaboration with Kitano) is fantastic, and yes, there are some jump-in-your-seat moments and unpredictable things (like that ""milk"" scene), but nothing really scary or chilling.""The Grudge 2"" has three stories loosely connected to each other (one of them is set in USA though the ""Chicago"" scenes are in fact shot in Japan) and none of them is hard to follow, but none of them is really intriguing either. You don't know what really happened to the main characters until the last chapter where different times and spaces start to merge with skillful editing. (This is a method the director used for his Japanese film ""Reincarnation."") By then, however, most of us have lost interest in the film itself, which only repeats the same trick as the first ""Grudge"" installment.After all with this jumbled storyline, we cannot relate to any of the characters, and we just don't care if someone is dead or survives.

Karen finds the old lady to be mute and sleeps throughout the day. Strange events occur in the house and Karen discovers that the building seems to be tainted by a curse caused by a grudge. Strange events begin to happen and people start dying. No matter how many victims are killed, The Grudge just won't stop. It seems that an evil emotion that takes the former of frightening-looking, blue Asian children and a sound that sounds like someone with a chicken bone stuck in their throat just can't be appeased.I watched THE GRUDGE with a group of friends late one night. Many of them were scared throughout the movie and couldn't go to sleep that night. Some of my friends didn't find the movie frightening at all, but several days later found that they were having nightmares and couldn't go to sleep. Japanese horror movies seem to have a psychological effect on some people that lets them experience terror when they would least expect it (I know people who were affected by THE RING the same way).However, I found THE GRUDGE to be one of the silliest, funniest, and most convoluted films that I have seen in a long time. I busted up laughing during the movie several times and was given strange stares by those around me. I just didn't find the movie very scary. Also, unlike some of my friends I didn't wake up days later having nightmares. Instead, I would find myself laughing at inopportune moments as I remembered some of the scenes from the movie. Most people I have talked to have thought my reactions to the film rather strange, but I have a friend who is a director and though he didn't find the movie to be funny, he did say &#34;it's garbage&#34;.There are many who will find the movie quite frightening. Personally, I recommend it to see the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar. She might not be a great actress, but she is attractive. The film also has Bill Pullman in a supporting role and Pullman is usually a joy to watch on the big screen, too.

Shimizu does this splendidly.  The out-of-sequence plot certainly helped to distract from its lack of depth.  Some of the acting was adequate while other performances fell flat but, hey, it's a horror movie for crying out loud.Where this movie shines is in its overall creepiness.  While a few of the kill scenes were tension-less, most were not.  That damn ghost, Kayako (?), was scary as hell and there was a lot of originality in the execution of her scenes.

How else to describe the lovely home this evil spirit occupies in ""The Grudge""? Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as Karen Davis a nurse living in Japan who provides care for those who require assisted living. This spooky ghost story scared up a hefty profit when it opened. It appears that grudges pay off for director Takashi Shimizu as this is his third or fourth remake of the same film. Luckily, the American remake refines the scares that made the Japanese theatrical hit such a big draw both overseas and even in the US. Keep in mind this is a suspenseful ghost story not a gore fest so don't expect a lot of blood and guts because that's not what this is all about (although it does have its moments). Top notch performances from the cast including Bill Pullman and Sarah Michelle Gellar help create a convincing, tense atmospheric thriller. While this has been Americanized for its audience, Takashi Shimizu's direction remains sharp and he refines his film making it a powerful, spooky thriller,A top notch transfer from Columbia highlights this terrific DVD. The colors are vivid and bright capturing the lovely, ghostly look of the original theatrical release perfectly. The 5.1 mix uses the format extremely well with nice imaging, sound and depth. The ethereal sound mix perfectly matches the tone and texture of the visual images.We get a five part documentary on the making of the movie. Sam Raimi (Darkman, Spiderman, Spiderman 2, Evil Dead, A Simple Plan, Army of Darkness) discusses his interest in the film and the cast including Bill Pullman and Sarah Michelle Gellar discuss what drew them to this ghost story. All comment on the stylish direction, the inspiration from Japanese folklore and its impact on the story. Screenwriter Susco discusses how he honed the original Japanese story and repackaged it for an American sensibility without losing what made the original so special. Director Shimizu discusses (via subtitles) how he crafted the story for a very different audience. Covering everything from the Myth of the Ju-On (the power of a woman's rage) to the culture shock the American cast faced making the movie.Under the Skin focuses not on what scares us but why we like to be scared. Joseph LeDoux a psychiatric professor and author discusses how viewing other people being threatened gives us the adrenaline rush that the characters feel without the threat of actual danger. Using footage from the film along with footage of LeDoux, this featurette doesn't tell us something we don't already know but confirms why we react the way we do to horror films, urban myths and stories. We also get a humber of previews from forthcoming Columbia releases.As usual Sam Raimi, Ted Raimi, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Robert Tapert, Clea  DuVall, Kadee Strickland, Stephen Susco all combine their talents for an informative, funny (and occasionally annoying) commentary track. They clearly are having such a good time doing the commentary track that even the annoying moments when they indulge themselves a bit too much are fun to listen to at least the first time.An unusual scary ghost story ""The Grudge"" will keep you on the edge of your seat. Well made, acted and produced the DVD looks exceptionally good. The extras include a comprehensive documentary on the making of the movie and a featurette on why we like fear in movies (and ghost stories). A great job overall by Columbia, the director, cast, screenwriter and producers Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert.",4,Spooky ghost thriller,1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,3538,"['Nasty', 'spirits', 'must', 'have', 'corner', 'Japanese', 'housing', 'market', 'How', 'else', 'describe', 'lovely', 'home', 'evil', 'spirit', 'occupies', 'Grudge', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'stars', 'Karen', 'Davis', 'nurse', 'living', 'Japan', 'who', 'care', 'who', 'require', 'assisted', 'living', 'spooky', 'ghost', 'story', 'scared', 'up', 'hefty', 'profit', 'when', 'opened', 'grudges', 'pay', 'off', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'third', 'fourth', 'remake', 'same', 'film', 'Luckily', 'American', 'remake', 'scares', 'made', 'Japanese', 'theatrical', 'hit', 'big', 'draw', 'overseas', 'even', 'US', 'Keep', 'mind', 'suspenseful', 'ghost', 'story', 'not', 'gore', 'fest', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'blood', 'guts', 'not', 'what', 'have', 'moments', 'Top', 'notch', 'performances', 'cast', 'including', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'help', 'create', 'convincing', 'tense', 'atmospheric', 'thriller', 'been', 'Americanized', 'audience', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'direction', 'sharp', 'film', 'making', 'powerful', 'spooky', 'thriller', 'A', 'top', 'notch', 'transfer', 'Columbia', 'highlights', 'terrific', 'DVD', 'colors', 'are', 'vivid', 'bright', 'capturing', 'lovely', 'ghostly', 'look', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'perfectly', '5.1', 'mix', 'format', 'extremely', 'well', 'nice', 'imaging', 'sound', 'depth', 'ethereal', 'sound', 'mix', 'perfectly', 'tone', 'texture', 'visual', 'images.We', 'get', 'five', 'part', 'documentary', 'making', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Darkman', 'Spiderman', 'Spiderman', '2', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'interest', 'film', 'cast', 'including', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'discuss', 'what', 'drew', 'ghost', 'story', 'comment', 'stylish', 'direction', 'inspiration', 'Japanese', 'folklore', 'impact', 'story', 'Screenwriter', 'Susco', 'how', 'honed', 'original', 'Japanese', 'story', 'repackaged', 'American', 'sensibility', 'losing', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'special', 'Director', 'Shimizu', 'subtitles', 'how', 'crafted', 'story', 'very', 'different', 'audience', 'Covering', 'everything', 'Myth', 'Ju-On', 'power', 'woman', 'rage', 'culture', 'American', 'cast', 'faced', 'making', 'movie.Under', 'Skin', 'not', 'what', 'why', 'like', 'be', 'scared', 'Joseph', 'LeDoux', 'psychiatric', 'professor', 'author', 'how', 'viewing', 'other', 'people', 'being', 'threatened', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'characters', 'feel', 'threat', 'actual', 'danger', 'Using', 'footage', 'film', 'footage', 'LeDoux', 'featurette', ""n't"", 'tell', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'why', 'react', 'way', 'do', 'horror', 'films', 'urban', 'myths', 'stories', 'also', 'get', 'humber', 'previews', 'forthcoming', 'Columbia', 'releases.As', 'usual', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Robert', 'Tapert', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'Kadee', 'Strickland', 'Stephen', 'Susco', 'combine', 'talents', 'informative', 'funny', 'occasionally', 'annoying', 'commentary', 'track', 'clearly', 'are', 'having', 'such', 'good', 'time', 'doing', 'commentary', 'track', 'even', 'annoying', 'moments', 'when', 'indulge', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'fun', 'listen', 'least', 'first', 'time.An', 'unusual', 'scary', 'ghost', 'story', 'Grudge', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'Well', 'made', 'acted', 'produced', 'DVD', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'extras', 'include', 'comprehensive', 'documentary', 'making', 'movie', 'featurette', 'why', 'like', 'fear', 'movies', 'ghost', 'stories', 'great', 'job', 'overall', 'Columbia', 'director', 'cast', 'screenwriter', 'producers', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Robert', 'Tapert']",N/A
872781,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B0006SGYL0,Westley,"[8, 13]","""The Grudge"" is based on the Japanese hit, ""Ju On,"" which I viewed a few months before watching this film.  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen Davis, an American student who works for some kind of social work agency - the details are never really apparent.  When one of her colleagues fails to show up for work, Gellar is sent to care for an elderly patient.  Upon arriving at the home, Gellar finds a creepy boy (Toshio) locked in the closet, which sets into action the main plot.I'm definitely not opposed to foreign films being remade for the American market; however, they seldom live up to the original, as is the case with ""The Grudge.""  The film retains many of the original elements, including the Tokyo locale, director Takashi Shimizu, several Japanese stars, and the basic story.  Interestingly, much of the background story has changed, which makes the plot more linear and comprehensible.  However, the result is a story that is much more obvious and devoid of suspense.  What played as mystical and creepy in the original film with Japanese actors sometimes seems semi-laughable when Gellar or Bill Pullman are inserted into the action.  I'm not a Buffy fan, but I couldn't help but think that Gellar should kick the specter into next year.I wasn't a big fan of ""Ju On,"" but it did have creepy atmosphere that's missing from ""The Grudge.""

872784,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B0006SGYL0,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[2, 4]","In the DVD extras there are several featurettes about the making of this film. One of the most telling is the one where they talk about the writing of the script with surprising candor. There were over 100 group meetings about the story, all with the Japanese filmmakers and producers arguing for one type of movie and the American filmmakers and producers arguing for another. The result is the watered down The Grudge 2, which neither captures the imagery and suspense that makes Japanese horror genuinely startling and spooky or the plotlines and characters that make American horror easy to relate to and entertaining.The Grudge 2 is a hodge podge of gimmicks taken from the first remake (The Grudge) as well as the original Japanese versions (Juon, Juon: The Grudge, etc.). Although you can still vaguely make out Takashi Shimizu's directorial hand in this film, it doesn't work this time. The reasons are numerous, but mostly it's just a failed hybrid of American and Japanese horror at work, as well as the basic story of a haunted house that curses those who enter beginning to show signs of weakness. There's only so far that story can be extended, and it's reaching its breaking point. (Which doesn't give that much hope for Juon: The Grudge 3, even though it will be made entirely in Japan).The storyline in this film bounces through time and geography far too much to stay coherent, and two of the leads (Amber Tamblyn and Arielle Kebbel) look too much alike for the stories to flash back and forth so much. It's all designed like a Japanese horror film where the plot is secondary to the images, but there is a profound lack of spooky images in this film to make up for the gaping plot holes. Why do the ghosts possess people in Chicago instead of just killing them like they do in Japan?It's all very confusing, and Sarah Michelle Gellar is lucky to get out quickly. Her entire role in this film barely qualifies her for a cameo.Also included on this DVD are three short films made by Toby Wilkins that tie into the whole Grudge story. And by short I mean around two or three minutes each. They each have their own spooky images, but end up feeling a little too much like ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" schlock more than credible short horror films.If you happen to watch this movie, before you take it out of your DVD player in disgust (or plain boredom) be sure to check out the special features with the making of featurettes, because they do manage to shed some light on the issues that went into making this film. And remember: sometimes sequels advance storylines and take the action even farther... and sometimes they're designed just so a big studio can line its pockets with your money. This film falls into the latter of the two categories.",2,The DVD extras are better than the movie itself,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,2763,"['DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'several', 'featurettes', 'making', 'film', 'One', 'most', 'telling', 'one', 'where', 'talk', 'writing', 'script', 'surprising', 'candor', 'were', '100', 'group', 'meetings', 'story', 'Japanese', 'filmmakers', 'producers', 'arguing', 'one', 'type', 'movie', 'American', 'filmmakers', 'producers', 'arguing', 'result', 'watered', 'down', 'Grudge', '2', 'imagery', 'suspense', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'genuinely', 'startling', 'spooky', 'plotlines', 'characters', 'make', 'American', 'horror', 'easy', 'relate', 'entertaining.The', 'Grudge', '2', 'hodge', 'podge', 'gimmicks', 'taken', 'first', 'remake', 'Grudge', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'Japanese', 'versions', 'Juon', 'Juon', 'Grudge', 'etc.', 'can', 'still', 'vaguely', 'make', 'out', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'directorial', 'hand', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'time', 'reasons', 'are', 'numerous', 'mostly', 'just', 'failed', 'hybrid', 'American', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'basic', 'story', 'haunted', 'house', 'who', 'enter', 'beginning', 'show', 'signs', 'weakness', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'extended', 'reaching', 'breaking', 'point', 'Which', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'hope', 'Juon', 'Grudge', '3', 'even', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'entirely', 'Japan', '.The', 'storyline', 'film', 'time', 'geography', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'stay', 'coherent', 'two', 'leads', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'look', 'too', 'much', 'stories', 'flash', 'back', 'forth', 'so', 'much', 'designed', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'where', 'plot', 'secondary', 'images', 'profound', 'lack', 'spooky', 'images', 'film', 'make', 'up', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'Why', 'do', 'ghosts', 'possess', 'people', 'Chicago', 'instead', 'just', 'killing', 'do', 'Japan', 'very', 'confusing', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'lucky', 'get', 'out', 'quickly', 'entire', 'role', 'film', 'barely', 'cameo.Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'three', 'short', 'films', 'made', 'Toby', 'Wilkins', 'tie', 'whole', 'Grudge', 'story', 'short', 'mean', 'around', 'two', 'three', 'minutes', 'have', 'own', 'spooky', 'images', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Are', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'more', 'credible', 'short', 'horror', 'films.If', 'happen', 'watch', 'movie', 'take', 'DVD', 'player', 'disgust', 'plain', 'boredom', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'special', 'features', 'making', 'featurettes', 'do', 'manage', 'shed', 'light', 'issues', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'remember', 'sometimes', 'sequels', 'advance', 'storylines', 'take', 'action', 'even', 'farther', 'sometimes', ""'re"", 'designed', 'just', 'so', 'big', 'studio', 'can', 'line', 'pockets', 'money', 'film', 'latter', 'two', 'categories']",N/A
