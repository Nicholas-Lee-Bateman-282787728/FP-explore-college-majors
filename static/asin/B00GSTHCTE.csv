There is a short recap of each regular season game, then a closer look at the NFC Championship game and the Super Bowl.

Honestly, I would have loved it if they had included another disk of the game in its entirety. But, that's not worth me taking off a star for that, so I'll leave it at 5 stars.It still hasn't really sunk in for me, personally, that the Seahawks made it to the Super Bowl, let alone won so convincingly.

I was a bit uninspired at first when my mom gave me this as a gift... leaving it unopened for days before finally breaking it open on a Monday night. Documentaries are notorious for being bland, even if one DOES feature your favorite team of your favorite sport. This one won't be a bore for a minute. I know it takes a special sort of fan to appreciate things like behind-the-scenes soundbits, especially when they're just clips of coach's pep talks, before, middle, or after a game... and I know that the idea of a highlight DVD is not the same as one that actually provides legal reruns of full games (In the works!), but this footage is actually varied in a very discreet way. You don't hear the commentators you heard on TV... you get to hear the ones that were on local radio, Steve Raible (Former NFL and Hawk if I'm not mistaken) et al. You get to hear soundbits from along the sidelines not featured in 'Mic'd Up' and other things you simply didn't see in other behind-the-scenes footage that WAS featured by mainstream media.

I could have been more careful, and the DVD could have been titled in a way that wouldn&#8217;t be misleading.But even taking the DVD for what it is&#8212;a season review&#8212;it fails miserably.  The shots are so up-close, it&#8217;s like watching the program though a peephole: All you see is one or two players or the ball!  Few shots are longer than two seconds, and with the silly ominous-sounding music, this is the equivalent of a football music video.  Some hack at NFL Films must have gone hog-wild in the editing room dicing and splicing the footage.  And there are too many ground-level shots.At under 90 minutes, one could complain that the DVD is too short.

The Seattle Seahawks and the -th fans can hold their heads with pride-ain't saying nothing against them.  This game was nothing more than what happens when one excellent team still over-achieves and the other excellent team way under achieves.  Still, two points must be made.  It's easier to choke on offense then defense.  And for the last 7 years the QB with more Super Bowl victories/experience than the other team's always winds up under performing and losing.  Call it the Brady Effect after the pressure of his 3 superbowls were too much and he started the trend.But other than Seahawks -th fans I can't imagine who else is buying this particular treasure other than same very mean people sending it off to their Bronco friends.  Too bad I don't know anybody that lives in Denver or I may do the same myself.As for the -th fan nonsense the Seahawks keep mentioning to everyone and the world I want to put it out here first and foremost.  The Buffalo Bills put their 12th Fans up on their Ring of Honor way back in 1992 when Hasselback still had hair.  The Seahawks acting like their have proclaimed this as their original idea is just a pile of it.  Big ol' pile.And remember, XXLVII years from now when Seattle has just this one lone Super Bowl victory we'll all still remember the incredible tenacity and fortitude the Buffalo Bills demonstrated going to 4 straight Super Bowls.  and in XXLVII more years maybe, just maybe Norwood's wide right kick will finally be a dying ember of a memory when my dementia kicks in.",1,Egads!
