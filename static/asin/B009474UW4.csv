There aren't any new special features, and the errors in episode orders throughout some of the seasons are incorrect.

1585034,A19K5DILM15WU3,B009474UW4,Alex,"[6, 6]","If you're a child of the '80's or 90's, then you probably grew up watching ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" This set collects all of the individual Lions Gate DVD releases to present the entire series in one box set. Those individual releases had some errors, all of which are repeated here since the disc contents are identical. Most of the errors are with the episode order, including 2 episodes from season 5 that were missed when that set was released, so those episodes are actually found on the season 10 disc. Some episodes are also presented multiple times across the discs. This set would have received 5 stars, but loses some points due to these errors. The disc count could have been decreased as well if they chose to redo them for this set. Some discs contain as many as 13 episodes, while others have as few as 7. If they cut out the repeated episodes, corrected the episode order, and averaged the episodes per disc, they could have saved some plastic.The packaging is visually impressive, looking like the Turtles' Party Van. The inside has slots covered in fabric to prevent the discs from touching. It is easy to remove individual discs without touching the bottoms as well. The top is also padded. The packaging has a few flaws though. The top half doesn't secure in any way other than simply resting on top of the discs. It would have been better to have it either hinged or have a way for it to snap in place. If it were to fall off a shelf, your discs will go flying everywhere. It also comes with a booklet with an episode guide and bonus feature listing. It doesn't really fit inside the van, unless you bend it around the top of the discs. It should have been made smaller or had a compartment for it.Due to the new Nickelodeon series, all of the Lions Gate releases are now out of print with no current plans to re-release these episodes. The complete series set now comes with a pretty steep second-market value. Used sets can sometimes be found for as cheap as $50, but new sets are rarely seen available for under $150. If you just want the episodes, the individual releases are much easier to come by (Amazon still has all of them in stock). Collecting them all that way is MUCH cheaper than this set and the only thing you miss out on is the party van. You still get every episode and bonus feature if you buy them separately.",4,"Every Classic Episode Full of ""Turtle Power""!",1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,2356,"[""'re"", 'child', ""'80"", '90', 'then', 'probably', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'set', 'individual', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'DVD', 'present', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'box', 'set', 'individual', 'releases', 'had', 'errors', 'are', 'repeated', 'here', 'disc', 'contents', 'are', 'identical', 'Most', 'errors', 'are', 'episode', 'order', 'including', '2', 'episodes', 'season', '5', 'were', 'missed', 'when', 'set', 'was', 'released', 'episodes', 'are', 'actually', 'found', 'season', '10', 'disc', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'presented', 'multiple', 'times', 'discs', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'received', '5', 'stars', 'points', 'due', 'errors', 'disc', 'count', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decreased', 'as', 'well', 'chose', 'redo', 'set', 'discs', 'contain', 'as', 'many', '13', 'episodes', 'others', 'have', 'as', 'few', '7', 'cut', 'out', 'repeated', 'episodes', 'corrected', 'episode', 'order', 'averaged', 'episodes', 'disc', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'plastic.The', 'packaging', 'visually', 'impressive', 'looking', 'Turtles', 'Party', 'Van', 'inside', 'slots', 'covered', 'fabric', 'prevent', 'discs', 'touching', 'easy', 'remove', 'individual', 'discs', 'touching', 'bottoms', 'well', 'top', 'also', 'padded', 'packaging', 'few', 'flaws', 'top', 'half', ""n't"", 'secure', 'way', 'other', 'simply', 'resting', 'top', 'discs', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'hinged', 'have', 'way', 'snap', 'place', 'were', 'fall', 'off', 'shelf', 'discs', 'will', 'go', 'flying', 'everywhere', 'also', 'booklet', 'episode', 'guide', 'bonus', 'feature', 'listing', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'van', 'bend', 'top', 'discs', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'smaller', 'had', 'compartment', 'it.Due', 'new', 'Nickelodeon', 'series', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'releases', 'are', 'now', 'print', 'current', 'plans', 're-release', 'episodes', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'now', 'pretty', 'steep', 'second-market', 'value', 'Used', 'sets', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'found', 'as', 'cheap', '50', 'new', 'sets', 'are', 'rarely', 'seen', 'available', '150', 'just', 'want', 'episodes', 'individual', 'releases', 'are', 'much', 'easier', 'come', 'Amazon', 'still', 'stock', 'Collecting', 'way', 'MUCH', 'cheaper', 'set', 'only', 'thing', 'miss', 'out', 'party', 'van', 'still', 'get', 'episode', 'bonus', 'feature', 'buy', 'separately']",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete Classic Series Collection

It's packaged beautifully, a plastic barrier on top containing the episode guide keeps it in place, and all discs were in their slots perfectly.  I like this better than separate cases because I can just pull seasons/episodes accordingly.  The case is not economical, mine is just sitting on a table for now, but I'm sure I'll find some creative way to display it, or possibly store it and put the discs in sleeves.  From the episode guide, everything seems to be in order as they were aired (although some of the episodes may not have been in correct order during the original presentation).

First there was the underground comics published by Mirage Comics. Then we got the immensely popular 1987 Fred Wolf cartoon which put the Turtles on the map. I grew up on this show with ""Turtle Fever."" As a result it is hard to separate from my feelings of nostalgia for this series in order to give an objective review. As a kid, the atmosphere of this show, combined with the animation is enough to make anybody a fan. As an adult, it is easy to not take this show so seriously. While this show was based on the more adult fare of the comics, it was watered down for kids. Seasons 1 and 2 are more action oriented (with season 1 acting as a mini-series for the origin of the Turtles). By season 3, camp ensues. In fact, seasons 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 were all much more comedy based with minimal action. Season 8 brought back a lot of action that was seen in the first 2 seasons. Season 9 and 10 continued this. This series is also known for building a mythology around the Turtles, creating and giving exposure to a lot of new characters. The character designs and animation are still impressive for 80's animation as a lot of 80's cartoons were rather embarrassing. This series also has one of the most famous intro themes of any classic cartoon.

I showed my son a couple episodes of the older cartoon online, and he loved them.  I wanted to buy him a couple seasons, but for the cost to buy just a couple random seasons (there are 10 total) seemed silly.  When this box set came out and it had the cool looking display case, I had to buy it for my son for his birthday.  He opened it up and has watched each of the 23 discs two or three times already (some discs more then that if they have favorite episodes he likes on them).  This was a great gift for a fan, and I enjoyed watching the old cartoon with him when it was too cold to go outside to play.  Great purchase, great price, great gift.  The only down side is the case's top (the top half of the van) just sits on the bottom half...so my 4 year old has knocked it over a few times and tried to pick it up and the bottom has fallen out w/ all the dvd's.

As a kid I did grow up with this show a little, but I mostly grew up watching the three live action movies more so than this show. When in comparison to say the comic books, the original source of this show, it feels, a bit of a let down to how some of the characters were turned into, I felt it just wasn't a good adaption... imagine like how many people feels when they get a terrible live action movie adaptation of their favorite show... it's like thatIt's an overall okay show on it's own accord, perhaps a bit one too many episodes for my taste, but hey, that's what popularity gets you. It feels like an eighties show, and that is hit and miss with me most of the time ie.

The van is terrific as far as holding the discs is concerned, as instead of sleeves, they're merely held in place by shallow slots that prevent the discs from being scratched when removed form the box; however, there is nothing to lock the top securely in place, which is a bummer. The wheels do roll.The extra episodes from the final season are still on the first season disc, meaning you have them on the set twice; the episodes are in non-chronological order, meaning the &#34;vacation in Europe&#34; side season is still bundled with the much, much later seasons. You'll need an episode guide to watch all of this in proper order. Two of the season 5 episodes are on the season 10 discs. The entire season 2 is on just one disc, and with 13 23-ish minute episodes on a single disc, you get a lot more compression artefacting than on the other ones.The reason I'm glad I bought is that after about six months that it took me to watch the whole series, I decided for the hell of it to see how much it goes for on places like ebay, and discovered the prices had doubled or even tripled after this thing had gone out of print, so I'm glad to own something that's gone UP in value for a change.",4,Glad I bought this,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,1266,"['originally', 'shared', 'misgivings', 'execution', 'box', 'set', 'van', 'terrific', 'as', 'far', 'holding', 'discs', 'concerned', 'instead', 'sleeves', ""'re"", 'merely', 'held', 'place', 'shallow', 'slots', 'prevent', 'discs', 'being', 'scratched', 'when', 'removed', 'form', 'box', 'however', 'nothing', 'lock', 'top', 'securely', 'place', 'bummer', 'wheels', 'do', 'roll.The', 'extra', 'episodes', 'final', 'season', 'are', 'still', 'first', 'season', 'disc', 'meaning', 'have', 'set', 'twice', 'episodes', 'are', 'non-chronological', 'order', 'meaning', '34', 'vacation', 'Europe', '34', 'side', 'season', 'still', 'bundled', 'much', 'much', 'later', 'seasons', ""'ll"", 'need', 'episode', 'guide', 'watch', 'proper', 'order', 'Two', 'season', '5', 'episodes', 'are', 'season', '10', 'discs', 'entire', 'season', '2', 'just', 'one', 'disc', '13', '23-ish', 'minute', 'episodes', 'single', 'disc', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'compression', 'artefacting', 'other', 'ones.The', 'reason', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'six', 'months', 'took', 'watch', 'whole', 'series', 'decided', 'hell', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'places', 'ebay', 'discovered', 'prices', 'had', 'doubled', 'even', 'tripled', 'thing', 'had', 'gone', 'print', ""'m"", 'glad', 'own', 'something', 'gone', 'UP', 'value', 'change']",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete Classic Series Collection
