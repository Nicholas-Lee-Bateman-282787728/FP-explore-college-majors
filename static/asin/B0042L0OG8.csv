I was looking for something thought-provoking and I found it in ""Strapped"". The main character leads a difficult life. He responds to his client's needs both mentally and physically. He is the person they need him to be. You don't feel very sorry for him though. He seems to enjoy his life. He doesn't run from encounters, though he does seem to ask himself,"" What am I doing here?"" more than once as the movie progresses. Each encounter seems to force him to reflect on himself. He doesn't seem to dislike what he finds, either. In the end he has a lightbulb moment, but then the movie is over, leaving the audience with questions as to exactly how this changes his life.Overall I recommend the movie highly.

I am so glad that I just threw my hands in the air and said to hell with it. I netflixed the movie and it was a terrific film.  It was brilliant, how the apartment building was a world in and of itself that managed to incorporate a variety of gay types of men.  There was the masculine unsure gay man, then there were the outrageous queens, and then the self loathing gay man living a lie, next was the supportive old gay, and finally the perfect guy -the one that fits and clicks.I loved this movie so much, I couldnt help but to fall in love with the Hustler, he was so kind (playing his part to perfection I guess) but he was really cool and just kick back. He didnt seem bitter or jaded at all.  He was just the perfect (I dont want to say prostitute) but he was just good at it. He was very malleable and able to adjust to any situation.

1383378,A3D1W9DU4XB30Q,B0042L0OG8,Bobby,"[0, 0]","I'll be honest; I expected ""Strapped"" to be watchable at best. It just has so many things going against it on paper. Writers, directors, and actors that most people wouldn't know and very few theatrical screenings as well (it got at least one screening though since the NY Times gave it a mini review). Every now and then you get a real out of nowhere surprise with, but most of the time films like this end up collecting dust until it's officially lost in time with the other rubbish nobody knows exists. However, ""Strapped"" definitly isn't one of those films. I was actually blown away how good this one was. With over 100 reviews on here; it seems other people have taken notice as well.The plot centers around a young hustler who's trying to make it out of an apartment building on a rainy evening. However it's easier said than done, and soon he has multiple encounters with the many gay men who live there. Is everything what it seems, or is something more going on? ""Strapped"" does a fantastic job of keeping the audience wondering that throughout. I won't spoil the end, but I will say that I was really pleased by it. It's surprising, and it isn't at the same time. What is definitly surprising though is how well done it all is. Ben Bonenfant (who's actually straight) is fantastic as the lead (seriously, the guy can act), and all the encounters he has are compelling, and feel completely genuine (and even sometimes loving). The writing and directing are also top notch, and all the supporting actors do a really good job too. The film is also sexy, but not in an explicit way. There's some nudity, but it is all about the discussions the actors have with each other, and their faces when they're having sex. It isn't about how much skin is being shown.Overrall there's just alot to love about this one. It may not be as well known as many other films, but who cares? So much crap comes out of Hollywood every week, and it's great to have such good indie films like this as a way to enjoy cinema when your local theater is full of garbage.",5,A surprisingly really great film,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,2051,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'expected', 'Strapped', 'be', 'watchable', 'best', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'paper', 'Writers', 'directors', 'actors', 'most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'very', 'few', 'theatrical', 'screenings', 'well', 'got', 'least', 'one', 'screening', 'NY', 'Times', 'gave', 'mini', 'review', 'now', 'then', 'get', 'real', 'nowhere', 'surprise', 'most', 'time', 'films', 'end', 'up', 'collecting', 'dust', 'officially', 'lost', 'time', 'other', 'rubbish', 'nobody', 'exists', 'However', 'Strapped', 'definitly', ""n't"", 'one', 'films', 'was', 'actually', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'good', 'one', 'was', '100', 'reviews', 'here', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'taken', 'notice', 'well.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'young', 'hustler', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'apartment', 'building', 'rainy', 'evening', 'However', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'soon', 'multiple', 'encounters', 'many', 'gay', 'men', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'everything', 'what', 'something', 'more', 'going', 'Strapped', 'fantastic', 'job', 'keeping', 'audience', 'wondering', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'end', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'pleased', 'surprising', ""n't"", 'same', 'time', 'What', 'definitly', 'surprising', 'though', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'Ben', 'Bonenfant', 'who', 'actually', 'straight', 'fantastic', 'lead', 'seriously', 'guy', 'can', 'act', 'encounters', 'are', 'compelling', 'feel', 'completely', 'genuine', 'even', 'sometimes', 'loving', 'writing', 'directing', 'are', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'supporting', 'actors', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'too', 'film', 'also', 'sexy', 'not', 'explicit', 'way', 'nudity', 'discussions', 'actors', 'have', 'other', 'when', ""'re"", 'having', 'sex', ""n't"", 'how', 'much', 'skin', 'being', 'shown.Overrall', 'just', 'alot', 'love', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'who', 'So', 'much', 'crap', 'Hollywood', 'week', 'great', 'have', 'such', 'good', 'indie', 'films', 'like', 'way', 'enjoy', 'cinema', 'when', 'local', 'theater', 'full', 'garbage']",N/A

After they finish, he can't find his way out of the building, but soon encounters a diverse group of other residents, all of whom are also in the market for something that he can offer.  He professionally and efficiently does what he does best: provide the fantasy they want, gets his money, and moves on to someone else.  But his final encounter in the building is with a young man who wants something Alex has never considered he is capable of providing, at any price: affection and emotional intimacy.I ""passed"" on this originally, based on the trailer (which makes it look a bit sleazy), but picked it up based on a friend's recommendation.  And I'm glad I did.  Writer/director Joseph Graham offers a surprisingly intelligent and thought-provoking look at intimacy, via a pivotal day in the life of a young man who provides physical intimacy to strangers for a price, but has never really considered his own sexuality leading to any relationship.  As the hustler, newcomer Ben Bonenfant is absolutely riveting with a natural sexiness coupled with intelligence and a significant dose of cynicism.

For the first 10-20 minutes, I thought it was going to be disappointing and be like a B-rated movie.  However, I stuck with it, and became very absorbed by the plot within 30 minutes.  The lead character, Adam, played perfectly by Ben Bonenfant (do watch his great commentary in Features), is a sociopathic hustler (aren't all good hustlers sociopaths?).  He morphs his behavior as he meets one person or group of persons after another in the same building, all to impress them and make some bucks with his good looks and sex.  But surprising and touching events begin to happen along the way.  Some great pulls on heartstrings here.This movie makes me think of a mashup between ""Where The Day Takes You"" (compare Dermot Mulroney's character, King, with Ben Bonenfant's character, Adam) with a young man trying to control his life and the movie ""Four Rooms,"" which has multiple stories within one building.After submitting this review, I am most definitely going to look for more of actor Ben Bonenfant's and writer/director Joseph Graham's work.

Strapped is (and you'll understand this when you see it) simultaneously dark and heartwarming in a way that I've never seen in a film before.Surprisingly, this film reminded me of two mainstream films that I saw years ago, Jacob's Ladder and Siesta, but the ending is different and far more engaging than either of those films.If you like smart, edgy gay drama, then this is a great film for you.

1383414,A2MQRLNE3E3HZ4,B0042L0OG8,"Mark A. Knight ""St. Pete Guy""","[66, 72]","Writer/director Joseph Graham presents a new notch on the hustler genre belt. The hustler film probably started in 1950's Sunset BLVD, with William Holden servicing Swanson's Norma Desmond. In the early 60's Tennessee Williams had two gigolo films (Sweet Smell of Success and The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone),and one featured, briefly, a male prostitute with his male client, admiring his new gift ring. Nineteen sixty nine, a good year for sex in the cinema, saw the template for the current gay hustler story, Midnight Cowboy.Since Joe Buck sauntered along the New York streets, the hustler film rivals the coming out film in Queer Cinema as subject matter. Andy Warhol's Flesh, Mala Noche,My Own Private Idaho, johns, Sex Life in L.A., Hustler White,Live for Sex Die for Love, Mysterious Skin, Sugar, Twist, Boy Culture, Men for Sale, End Game,and In the Flesh to name a few, and that's not including the foreign language imports like Our Lady of the Assassins, Clandestinos, Bulgarian Lovers, and The Blue Hour.Strapped takes this cliched character and makes him a realistic, likable creation with one objective: get paid, get out. What turns this mercenary character sympathetic is that he's literally trapped, makes the best of a bad situation, and shows empathy to all his clients. Trapped in a Kafka like maze of hallways, the unnamed boy (although he pretends to be various names)seems to be meet every personification of the gay scene: coming out, drug addiction, denial, homophobia, even love.Director Graham, with his production team and camera operator, manage to take this Twilight Zone-like tale, and make the most of a low budget. Every shot is clear and visually interesting. The repetitive nature of the story stays intriguing up to the satisfying climax. Actor Ben Bonenfant's rentboy is handsome in an average boy-next-door way, and wisely underplays his role with a cunning vulnerability.  This one is worth buying.

Strapped is a case in point.  The lead character, a young male hustler, services a client in a non-descript urban apartment complex.  Strangely, he seems unable to find his way out of the Kafkaesque building, repeatedly running into different sorts of gay males who want to sample his wares.  Each of the successive clients seems to represent a different pathway of the gay lifestyle, posing many questions and conundrums along the way.  Some are ridiculously closeted, stuck in false, married lives.  Some are very liberated, but strangely unhappy.  Different sexual tastes are contrasted: aggressive, anal passive, bizarre things.  In the end the protagonist overcomes his own gay demons by allowing himself true romantic affection, perhaps.  The symbolism reminds me of the fine poem by Henri Cole, entitled Homosexuality, where the gay life is symbolized as a duck stuck in a chimney!The great strength of Strapped lay in its fine dialogue and characterization.  The script is dotted with literary and poetic allusions and various gay homages.  The fantastic artistry is made evident by more than just the frame trope of the labyrinth, but also much other symbolism and subtext along the way.  For instance, the metallic griffin stolen from the first client seems to symbolize sexual liberation.  There is some fine directing skill at work too.  In one scene, their is a vessel put to trap leaking rain water, and the elapsement of time is shown by empty and full shots.  Most importantly, the lead actor is exceedingly loveable.The only negative I might find about the movie is some of the graphic sexual content, but I guess that comes with the territory.

This stars Ben Bonenfant in the title role and for a hustler he comes across (forgive the pun) as a real 'tart with a heart'.The plot is quite simple in that a random or should I say routine 'trick' takes our eponymous hero back to his apartment for gay sex. He is a gay virgin and this hustler treats him with real humanity and care. He then finds it very hard to actually exit the building -and in his endeavours to escape finds rather more 'entrances' than is technically necessary in any film outside the porn genre.All that said it should come (there I go again) as no surprise as this apartment turns out to be the gayest apartment block on the gayest street in town- well when in Rome and all that. Even the straight guys turn out to want a bit of Ben and it is not always the same bit, which I think from a plot development point of view is necessary as seriously doing it that many times in such a short space of time would challenge even a Viagra addict to 'keep up' as it were.It is as I said a simple plot but what is strikingly brilliant is the breadth and depth of the characters that he meets and the humanity that unfolds in every story or occurrence, he is almost a social worker, that is one that charges an agreed fee before giving a full service. It is a warm, witty, charming, human and sometimes raunchy film but told and acted with real care and in many ways heart warming because of and not despite the regular sexual trysts.",4,Strapped means to sell your body for cash (for non US types as it is not that in the UK),1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,1484,"['Unusual', 'title', 'unusual', 'film', 'Ben', 'Bonenfant', 'title', 'role', 'hustler', 'forgive', 'pun', 'real', ""'tart"", ""heart'.The"", 'plot', 'quite', 'simple', 'random', 'should', 'say', 'routine', ""'trick"", 'eponymous', 'hero', 'back', 'apartment', 'gay', 'sex', 'gay', 'virgin', 'hustler', 'real', 'humanity', 'care', 'then', 'very', 'hard', 'actually', 'exit', 'building', '-and', 'endeavours', 'escape', 'finds', 'rather', 'more', ""'entrances"", 'technically', 'necessary', 'film', 'porn', 'genre.All', 'said', 'should', 'come', 'go', 'again', 'surprise', 'apartment', 'out', 'be', 'gayest', 'apartment', 'block', 'gayest', 'street', 'town-', 'well', 'when', 'Rome', 'Even', 'straight', 'guys', 'turn', 'out', 'want', 'bit', 'Ben', 'not', 'always', 'same', 'bit', 'think', 'plot', 'development', 'point', 'view', 'necessary', 'seriously', 'doing', 'many', 'times', 'such', 'short', 'space', 'time', 'would', 'challenge', 'even', 'Viagra', 'addict', ""'keep"", 'up', 'said', 'simple', 'plot', 'what', 'strikingly', 'brilliant', 'breadth', 'depth', 'characters', 'humanity', 'story', 'occurrence', 'almost', 'social', 'worker', 'one', 'agreed', 'fee', 'giving', 'full', 'service', 'warm', 'witty', 'charming', 'human', 'sometimes', 'raunchy', 'film', 'told', 'acted', 'real', 'care', 'many', 'ways', 'heart', 'warming', 'not', 'regular', 'sexual', 'trysts']",N/A
