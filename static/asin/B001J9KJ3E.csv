Josh Peck lands his 1st lead role in a film and does a great job, however I thought Ben Kingsley stole the show as Dr. Jeffrey Squires, M.D.The movie is fun and fast paced, with alot of real life coming of age drama in it. A great soundtrack and some nice New York City scenery. Mary Kate Olsen also plays a small part in the movie.Dr. Squires offers up some great advice towards the end of the movie when he says, ""never trust the following people""-people who don't smoke potpeople who don't like Bob Dylanpeople that don't like the beachpeople that don't like dogsI can personally only agree with the last two, but I thought it was a hilarious & touching part of the movieDon't miss out on ""The Wackness""....",5,"You only see the ""Wackness""...",1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,783,"['Really', 'good', 'movie', 'Just', 'watched', 'Wackness', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Josh', 'Peck', '1st', 'lead', 'role', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'however', 'thought', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'stole', 'show', 'Dr.', 'Jeffrey', 'Squires', 'M.D.The', 'movie', 'fun', 'fast', 'paced', 'alot', 'real', 'life', 'coming', 'age', 'drama', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'nice', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'scenery', 'Mary', 'Kate', 'Olsen', 'also', 'small', 'part', 'movie.Dr', 'up', 'great', 'advice', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'never', 'trust', 'following', 'people', '-people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'smoke', 'potpeople', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Bob', 'Dylanpeople', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'beachpeople', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'dogsI', 'can', 'personally', 'only', 'agree', 'last', 'two', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'part', 'movieDo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'Wackness']",N/A

If one were 17 back in 94, maybe it seems like a lot has changed. This seemingly indie flick does have a great 94 soundtrack centered on the Notorious B.I.G. Ben Kingsley plays a wacked out shrink who collects weed as payment from a 17-yr-old high school drug dealer, Josh Peck, with girl problems. How did the kid get served beer in bars if he was a teen? Small detail. The kid takes growing up lessons from Kingsley while coping with his parents going broke, as he falls for the shrink's hot daughter, who uses him up and throws him away in a flash.

1205485,A2C89EQ7KCG924,B001J9KJ3E,Brian Murphy,"[4, 5]","A good, heart-felt and feel-good movie. (Although it does help), It doesn't matter what type of music you were into, if you were from NYC, or if you were between the ages of 16-20 in the year 1994 - most people will be able to relate and enjoy this movie in one way or another. A decent coming of age movie that has some interesting scenarios and relationships; especially the one between the pot dealer, main character and his mid-life crisis, in the midst of a failed marriage shrink. The setting and shots of the streets of NYC, building rooftops, and the beach were great. And the music was ""dope"". Good performances by Josh Peck and Ben Kingsley. Some funny parts and a lot of ""I remember doing, feeling, or saying that"" parts.Now, unfortunately the ""not cool"" parts - 1) found the main character (Josh Peck) somewhat unbelievable. Don't get me wrong he played a good role but to have a hip, good-looking kid, into rap & hip-hop, with `mad' slang and being a huge pot dealer not being able to get laid by the age of 18, was hard to believe. 2) the movie never explained (not even a quick line or flashback) how the main character was able to buy extreme large quantities of weed from Jamaicans in Queens/Brooklyn and sell it to everyone out in the tough streets and schools of NYC. I mean this was a skinny, Jewish kid peddling pot left & right to people from an icee cart and not getting jumped or arrested - huh? 3) The advice given, the large drug and alcohol used and exchanged, the hanging out time at the bar, on the streets, at the beach between Kingsley character (the shrink) and Luke (main character) was a little far fetched.All rolled up, I give this movie a 3.8 star rating. Sure there were some implausibleness about the general premise and characters but with the strong bonds that the viewer forms with these relatable and tender story lines and characters, it doesn't really matter. The story and the directing really made me want to go back and rewind some cassette tapes of some good mid-nineties hip/hop and rap, skateboard or roam the streets (especially in NYC), check out some fly girls, and then kick back and relax with  some 40's in brown paper bags and have a good smoke. And if that doesn't make this movie worth watching then that's ""wack"".",4,Throw Your Wack Up,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,2274,"['good', 'heart-felt', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'help', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'type', 'music', 'were', 'were', 'NYC', 'were', 'ages', '16-20', 'year', '1994', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'one', 'way', 'decent', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'interesting', 'scenarios', 'relationships', 'especially', 'one', 'pot', 'dealer', 'main', 'character', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'midst', 'failed', 'marriage', 'shrink', 'setting', 'shots', 'streets', 'NYC', 'building', 'rooftops', 'beach', 'were', 'great', 'music', 'was', 'dope', 'Good', 'performances', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'funny', 'parts', 'lot', 'remember', 'doing', 'feeling', 'saying', 'parts.Now', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'cool', 'parts', '1', 'found', 'main', 'character', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'somewhat', 'unbelievable', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'played', 'good', 'role', 'have', 'hip', 'good-looking', 'kid', 'rap', 'hip-hop', 'mad', 'slang', 'being', 'huge', 'pot', 'dealer', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'laid', 'age', '18', 'was', 'hard', 'believe', '2', 'movie', 'never', 'explained', 'not', 'even', 'quick', 'line', 'flashback', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'able', 'buy', 'extreme', 'large', 'quantities', 'weed', 'Jamaicans', 'Queens/Brooklyn', 'sell', 'everyone', 'out', 'tough', 'streets', 'schools', 'NYC', 'mean', 'was', 'skinny', 'Jewish', 'kid', 'peddling', 'pot', 'left', 'right', 'people', 'icee', 'cart', 'not', 'getting', 'jumped', 'arrested', 'huh', '3', 'advice', 'given', 'large', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'used', 'exchanged', 'hanging', 'out', 'time', 'bar', 'streets', 'beach', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'shrink', 'Luke', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'little', 'far', 'fetched.All', 'rolled', 'up', 'give', 'movie', '3.8', 'star', 'rating', 'Sure', 'were', 'implausibleness', 'general', 'premise', 'characters', 'strong', 'bonds', 'viewer', 'forms', 'relatable', 'tender', 'story', 'lines', 'characters', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'story', 'directing', 'really', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'rewind', 'cassette', 'tapes', 'good', 'mid-nineties', 'hip/hop', 'rap', 'skateboard', 'roam', 'streets', 'especially', 'NYC', 'check', 'out', 'fly', 'girls', 'then', 'kick', 'back', 'relax', '40', 'brown', 'paper', 'bags', 'have', 'good', 'smoke', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'watching', 'then', 'wack']",N/A

I found the two main characters rather annoying, especially Ben Kingsley's character, but they weren't so annoying that I turned the film off. I enjoyed listening to the classic hiphop, but it wasn't enough to carry the film. I didn't like how the film continually mentioned Giuliani, but it was in keeping with the period.And on and on.It's just an okay movie, I guess. It's not bad by any means, but it's not good, either. The characters are interesting, but they also seem a bit like caricatures. But that's the whole point: they seem like caricatures but they're really not.Let's contrast it withReality Bites (10th Anniversary Edition), which is a great film. What made it so good was the way it looked at the standard 90s fare. In the 90s, it was cool to be disaffected. Even Alanis Morrissette wasIronicin the 90s. Heck, everyone was doing it. Everyone had to seem so cool that they didn't even care about being cool. Reality Bites made fun of that mentality in a way that was actually interesting and moving.The Wackness doesn't really do that. It's main point is to show that these people who seem so cool and careless are really just messes. Their lives are full of turmoil. If only someone could see beneath the cold-hearted exterior, they would see someone who hurt deeply.Yeah, it's an alright premise, but even in writing it, it seems a bit silly. And that's The Wackness. A bit interesting, a bit silly. Overall, alright.If I could give it 2.5 stars, I would. Why?

1205488,A1LYD7EGJWFZJM,B001J9KJ3E,Day2,"[0, 0]","This retro hip-hop coming-of-age film was not on my radar and wouldn't have been due to the description, despite being an Audience Award winner at Sundance 2008. I only looked it up after picking up &#34;WARM BODIES&#34; at my local library (another teen coming-of-age film I only grabbed because the zombie setting seemed a clever twist).Turns out I actually loved &#34;Warm Bodies,&#34; which not only had a compelling screenplay very well acted by a skillful young cast, but the direction was outstanding. I hadn't heard of writer/director Jonathan Levine before, but have caught up on nearly all his work in the past 2 weeks and have much enjoyed doing so. And as much as I enjoyed the humor and playful romance of &#34;Warm Bodies&#34;, I think &#34;THE WACKNESS&#34; is the best in show.It's incredibly rare that so young a filmmaker gets so much right in creating a story with tense life crises in multiple age ranges. The ambition of this story was unexpectedly high, far more intricate than &#34;Isolated pothead loner falls in love while parents fight.&#34; Levine created the most realistically messy first-love story I've seen since &#34;ALL THE REAL GIRLS&#34; by then up & comer, David Gordon Green.Without giving away the story, I'll say the script shines in 3 areas:1) The estrangement of the teen lead to his parents as he discovers the awkward truth that they too (as all adults) are flawed people in  both career & love. The jarring uncertainty this brings about adulthood makes growing up unattractive to an existential degree. This is made better by the fact the parents are not portrayed as stereotypes and there are no facile quick-fixes to the marital problems presented throughout.2) The love story is so compellingly acted by the young leads that it brings the viewer along on the emotional ride of what teen first love feels like. A rare and lingering prize that maybe 1% of love stories get right. The romantic moments are kept simple and natural, developing out of the character's world instead of the Hollywood fantasies too commonly hurled at the screen.3) The grotesque & cynical teen projection of the protagonist of what kind of adulthood awaits him in the next 40 years, embodied by the brilliant Ben Kingsley. This performance received some criticism for being over the top, but such critics missed a fairly obvious point -- Kingsley (in my opinion) is not supposed to be a staunchly realistic character as much as hyperbolized nightmare of how an intelligent adult with a PhD and a hot younger wife can possess the &#34;features&#34; of successful adulthood, yet still be miserable. And this is executed with genius by Kingsley (and I NEVER say genius). And though he is warped by a young man's idea of an old man's regrets, every flaw reflects weight and substance back onto the hero's pain and dread. It was a risky maneuver performed exceedingly well.I recommend this to anyone who truly appreciates good cinema & storytelling. Funny, poignant, & sexy in an accurately raw and awkward fashion with talent displayed by all involved. Don't mistakenly imagine it's not your genre as I did. It's simply a great film.",5,"Ben Kingsley was absolutely delightful to watch (and I NEVER say ""delightful"")",1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,3152,"['retro', 'hip-hop', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'radar', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'due', 'description', 'being', 'Audience', 'Award', 'winner', 'Sundance', '2008', 'only', 'looked', 'up', 'picking', 'up', '34', 'WARM', 'BODIES', '34', 'local', 'library', 'teen', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'only', 'grabbed', 'zombie', 'setting', 'seemed', 'clever', 'twist', 'out', 'actually', 'loved', '34', 'Warm', 'Bodies', '34', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'compelling', 'screenplay', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'skillful', 'young', 'cast', 'direction', 'was', 'outstanding', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'writer/director', 'Jonathan', 'Levine', 'have', 'caught', 'up', 'nearly', 'work', 'past', '2', 'weeks', 'have', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'so', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'humor', 'playful', 'romance', '34', 'Warm', 'Bodies', '34', 'think', '34', 'THE', 'WACKNESS', '34', 'best', 'show.It', 'incredibly', 'rare', 'so', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'so', 'much', 'right', 'creating', 'story', 'tense', 'life', 'crises', 'multiple', 'age', 'ambition', 'story', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 'high', 'far', 'more', 'intricate', '34', 'Isolated', 'pothead', 'loner', 'love', 'parents', 'fight.', '34', 'Levine', 'created', 'most', 'realistically', 'messy', 'first-love', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', '34', 'REAL', 'GIRLS', '34', 'then', 'comer', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'story', ""'ll"", 'say', 'script', 'shines', '3', 'areas:1', 'estrangement', 'teen', 'lead', 'parents', 'awkward', 'truth', 'too', 'adults', 'are', 'flawed', 'people', 'career', 'love', 'jarring', 'uncertainty', 'adulthood', 'growing', 'up', 'unattractive', 'existential', 'degree', 'made', 'better', 'fact', 'parents', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'facile', 'quick-fixes', 'marital', 'problems', 'presented', 'throughout.2', 'love', 'story', 'so', 'compellingly', 'acted', 'young', 'viewer', 'emotional', 'ride', 'what', 'teen', 'first', 'love', 'feels', 'rare', 'lingering', 'prize', 'maybe', '1', '%', 'love', 'stories', 'get', 'right', 'romantic', 'moments', 'are', 'kept', 'simple', 'natural', 'developing', 'character', 'world', 'instead', 'Hollywood', 'fantasies', 'too', 'commonly', 'hurled', 'screen.3', 'grotesque', 'cynical', 'teen', 'projection', 'protagonist', 'what', 'kind', 'adulthood', 'awaits', 'next', '40', 'years', 'embodied', 'brilliant', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'performance', 'received', 'criticism', 'being', 'top', 'such', 'critics', 'missed', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'point', 'Kingsley', 'opinion', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'staunchly', 'realistic', 'character', 'as', 'much', 'hyperbolized', 'nightmare', 'how', 'intelligent', 'adult', 'PhD', 'hot', 'younger', 'wife', 'can', 'possess', '34', 'features', '34', 'successful', 'adulthood', 'still', 'be', 'miserable', 'executed', 'genius', 'Kingsley', 'NEVER', 'say', 'genius', 'warped', 'young', 'man', 'idea', 'old', 'man', 'regrets', 'flaw', 'weight', 'substance', 'back', 'hero', 'pain', 'dread', 'was', 'risky', 'maneuver', 'performed', 'exceedingly', 'well.I', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'truly', 'good', 'cinema', 'storytelling', 'Funny', 'poignant', 'sexy', 'accurately', 'raw', 'awkward', 'fashion', 'talent', 'displayed', 'involved', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mistakenly', 'imagine', 'not', 'genre', 'did', 'simply', 'great', 'film']",N/A
1205489,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001J9KJ3E,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[20, 21]","Yo! Don't be whack!The award winning film (Sundance Audience Award) ""The Wackness"" is now out on DVD and it's definitely one of the coolest and more pleasant coming-of-age films to come out in a long while and a DVD with features that embraces that non-traditional style courtesy of writer/director Josh Levine.""The Wackness"" stars well-known legendary award winning actor Ben Kingsley and ""Drake & Josh"" actor Josh Peck who appears to have shed his young teen Nickelodeon image for the character of 18-year-old Luke Shapiro.  Both playing roles so different from what we have seen of them and both delivering an exceptional performance.The year is 1994, A high school teenager in New York who doesn't have any friends but spends his time selling marijuana using his disguise as a person who sells ice in the park, while saving up all his money.But all is not cool in the life of Luke, his parents are having some financial problems and in danger of being evicted, his mind is on getting laid and losing his virginity and the only person he can communicate his emotions to is one of his clients, Dr. Jeffrey Squires (Ben Kingsley).  He wants some anti-depressants but Squires tells him to embrace his pain and more or less, he needs to find a girlfriend and get laid.Dr. Squires is not exactly a role model for Josh.  He's a product of the 60's, loves doing cocaine and marijuana and somehow, is able to connect with Luke and provides him professional advice for drugs.  But like Luke, his life is not at all going that great.  His relationship with his wife Kristin is not at all going so great and all they have is their memories of sex and doing drugs.  Meanwhile, he notices that his step-daughter Stephanie (Olivia Thirlby, ""Juno"") is getting closer to Luke.  But realizes that it's not love that she has for Luke, it's just a sexual fling.Luke doesn't have much experience with people, love and thus he discovers himself while hanging out with Stephanie.  Dr. Squires as a father doesn't want his stepdaughter to be around a drug dealer but at the same time, as his psychiatrist, he doesn't feel that Stephanie is good for Luke.  But after their passionate time together, he develops feelings for Stephanie so strong that when he says the words of ""I Love You"" to her, Stephanie realizes that this fling has gone so far and ends their romantic fling and all communication with Luke.  Around that same time, Dr. Squires wife Kristin decides to leave her husband.Both men are obviously heartbroken but somehow, they find comfort in talking with each other and thus Luke and Dr. Squires form a friendship that would interestingly introduce Dr. Squires to Luke's world and for Luke, getting the needed therapy from his shrink.  So, the story pretty much focuses on a young man (Luke) who is guided by an older man (Dr. Squires) but then the story starts to shift of the younger guy guiding an older man.VIDEO & AUDIO:The film is featured in anamorphic widescreen ala 2:35:1 ratio.  The film is shot in different parts of Tokyo but oviously scenes such as the Twin Towers had to be put into the film.  When you do a period piece, especially if it's 1994, with a busy city like New York, unless you have a huge budget, you got make do what with what you have.  And thus a lot of the scenes are shot indoors but you do have some outdoor scenes with Luke and Stephanie at the beach or areas where Luke is dealing drugs.As for audio, you get a English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital track and the film is primarily a dialogue driven film.  But audio-wise, what makes this film shine is the fact that it's 1994 and the old school songs, especially the hip-hop songs of that time are what comes blaring out your speakers.  Bass and all courtesy of artists such as Notorious B.I.G., a Tribe Called Quest, KRS-One, Nas, Biz Markie, etc.SPECIAL FEATURES:The DVD shines in its amount of special features offered.  Included are:* Commentary with Director Jonathan Levine and Actor Josh Peck - A very casual and cool commentary and you learn important tidbits about the film.  From Ben Kingsley giving advice to Josh, having to work with Mary-Kate in the amount of hours they had to work with her and how hard it was for Josh Peck to do his lovemaking scene with Olivia Thirlby.  Levine and Peck have cool and fun commentary talking about blunts, the music, it's typically a commentary that is like hanging out with friends.  Especially at the end when they talk about hanging out after the commentary and playing XBOX 360, you don't hear that on director's commentary, so it's all good.* Keeping it Real: A Day in the Life of Writer/Director Jonathan Levine - For this eight minute feature, Jonathan Levine is traveling around the country and London to promote ""The Wackness"" at film festivals and interviews at radio stations.  Jonathan is joined by the cast and his girlfriend, production designer Annie Spitz and his brother and his girlfriend.* Time in a Bottle: Behind the Scenes of The Wackness - An 18-minute featurette featuring behind-the-scenes on the making of the film.  Levine explains that the film is not 100% autobiographical and a screenplay that was based on an idea he had during filmschool.  Also, featuring Levine's staff and how they were able to get that 1994 setting.* The Luke Shapiro Show Episode 1 & 2 - These are five minute short episodes that were created for cable access featuring Luke Shapiro and his doorman Miguel.  The first featuring Luke, Miguel (on keyboards) and his super  Tony.  The second featuring Luke, Miguel (on keyboards) and a dancer.* Deleted Scenes - This scene features four deleted/extended scenes from the film.  The total amount of deleted scenes is about five minutes long featuring ""Luke Works in Cap and Gown"", ""Extended Squires Vacation"", ""Squires in Stephanie's Room"" and ""Dad's Walkman Scheme"".* The Wackness Trailers - Featuring all five theatrical and teaser trailersI have to say that ""The Wackness"" is a pretty cool coming-of-age film and yes, there have been many of these type of movies but a definitely, unique film.  Having the film set in 1994, having the main character as a drug dealer, having his psychiatrist as one of his clients and also a hardcore drug user and just how everything just comes together is quite enjoyable.But the performances by Ben Kingsley and Josh Peck was well done.  Two roles by talents that I would never see coming.  Ben Kingsley in so many serious roles in ""Ghandi"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Rules of Engagement"" to name a few and then Josh Peck who stars in the Nickelodeon teen show ""Drake & Josh"", these two taking on roles so different and to see them drinking alcohol and doing/dealing drugs, definitely it's quite a bit of a surprise.  But the unique thing is that these two talents had tremendous chemistry and everything worked out quite well.And there are also a good number of talent in this film.  Olivia Thirlby did a great job as Squire's daughter Stephanie and Luke's love interest.  Did a great job playing a sexual teen and then you have Mary-Kate Olsen as a pothead who just makes out with Ben Kingsley.  Famke Janssen as Dr. Squires sexy wife, Method Man playing the character ""Percy"" as Luke's supplier and much more.There are just these small moments in the film, from mannerisms to the small things that a character does, it really makes this film seem quite realistic and make it all work.  Of course, the early 90's nostalgia and the music plays a big part in the film.  When Luke and Olivia are making love, R. Kelly playing on the boom box to Luke playing Zelda on his NES, these small things are what many people who grew up at the time and listened to the music can related to.  So, definitely a nice touch!And the DVD,  just makes you love the film even more with cool commentary, the featurettes and more.  It's not all business-like and professional.  You have Levine and Peck quite casual and as I mentioned in the commentary section, it's like hanging out with a few friends and just everyone having a good time.Now granted, perhaps I may be a bit biased having grown up with the pop culture of the 90's and hearing the songs and the style from those years boosting my appreciation for the film but for an indie film, I have to admit that the overall presentation was quite non-traditional.  Again, there are a bunch of ""coming-of-age"" films out there but this one was really thinking outside of the box and instead of getting a ""revenge of the nerd"" happy-feel good storyline, each of these characters have flaws but it's all about discovering one's self.All in all, a solid DVD with a lot of humor, a lot of soul and all out fun!",4,"Fans of the film will definitely love this DVD!

Of course I judged the title thinking that the film would be some lame attempt of a superbad type comedy but man was I wrong. The wackness is actually quite easy to explain and although it contains a young man with an occupation that isn't known for such a lifestyle I feel a lot of teens can sort of relate to it. Luke Shapiro (Josh Peck) is a 17 year old just a day from graduation. He's an incredibly lonely drug dealer that is basically dieing inside from not living the life of having fun and being dumb. The film takes him on a small hip hop packed and smoke filled adventure to live some sort of a teenage life before the summers over. He eventually finds a friend in his psychiatrist Dr. Squires (Ben Kingsley) but it takes time for them to realize how important they are to each other.I've grown up watching Peck on Nick although he played great characters in those films he was mostly the side man and fell under the radar until he started getting a little older. My point is that I think this guy is a pretty good dramatic actor, better than his comedic roles he played on Nick. The acting was solid especially the slightly self destructive pot smoking Ben Kingsley, loved the cast. The story itself was a kind of crazy, I mean I believe that drug dealers are usually depicted as these people that get love and hate but not a lot of loneliness or at least not the high school type guys. I love how they put that spin on it because somehow everyone is linked by this. Peck's character shares what a lot of us had or even have, that big chunk of life you felt like you missed or are about to miss and all that experience and life just falls into your lap at one time.I mean overall I loved the movie, I think the insane but realistic characters even though the weed thing sends it over a bit but it pulls it to be a super cool movie. It also has one of the sickest soundtracks of all time. I love the fact that the movie didn't try and make cliche's or make fun of hip hop. It felt like it was truly paying homage to the music, another thing that helps ease through the times. If you're a fan of good movies period I know you'll love this film.

1205494,A2T049UQONS0OY,B001J9KJ3E,Larry VanDeSande,"[2, 4]","Set in New York in 1994, ""The Wackness"" is the odd romance where the men, not the women, have their hearts broken. Of the four main characters in the cast -- Josh Peck, Ben Kingsley, Olivia Thirlby and Famke Janssen (with Mary-Kate Olsen playing an oddball ingenue) -- the two women do in the two men, Thirlby as Peck's summer lover after they graduate high school, and Janssen as the poorly-matched spouse for Kingsley.Aside from this angle, I don't see all the great things the five star critics saw in this movie. It's about the kids graduating from high school and spending the summer in 1994 in urban affairs awaiting college in the autumn. Peck lives with his family while Thirlby is Janssen's daughter and stepdaughter to Kingsley, who is also Peck's analyst and customer for Peck's marijuana business he operates out of an ice cart.If this group of circumstances sounds silly, you'll get an idea what goes on in the movie. The quadrangle of main characters all have some kind of typical movie phobia -- they are either responsibility challenged, have a drug habit, are without direction in life or, in Kingsley's case, have all these attributes. Peck, the grass salesman sliding through life, is the character most likely to step up and do the right thing, ironically.A good soundtrack helps this along, which is helpful since the movie starts very slowly and doesn't gain much speed for most of the first 30 minutes until the two younger stars begin their affair. That seems to give the film direction and momentum, which is awkward at best with the focus on Peck's other customers, his loser family (which gets evicted from their home), and the nonstarter marriage between Kingsley and Janssen. Aside from Peck, it's difficult to care about anyone in this film. I think that's what makes it less than the sum of parts others around seem to be putting forward.",3,An overblown romance,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,1869,"['Set', 'New', 'York', '1994', 'Wackness', 'odd', 'romance', 'where', 'men', 'not', 'women', 'have', 'hearts', 'broken', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'cast', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Mary-Kate', 'Olsen', 'playing', 'oddball', 'ingenue', 'two', 'women', 'do', 'two', 'men', 'Thirlby', 'Peck', 'summer', 'lover', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'Janssen', 'poorly-matched', 'spouse', 'Kingsley.Aside', 'angle', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'great', 'things', 'five', 'star', 'critics', 'saw', 'movie', 'kids', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'spending', 'summer', '1994', 'urban', 'affairs', 'awaiting', 'college', 'autumn', 'Peck', 'family', 'Thirlby', 'Janssen', 'daughter', 'stepdaughter', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'also', 'Peck', 'analyst', 'customer', 'Peck', 'marijuana', 'business', 'ice', 'cart.If', 'group', 'circumstances', 'sounds', 'silly', ""'ll"", 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'quadrangle', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'kind', 'typical', 'movie', 'phobia', 'are', 'responsibility', 'challenged', 'have', 'drug', 'habit', 'are', 'direction', 'life', 'Kingsley', 'case', 'have', 'attributes', 'Peck', 'grass', 'salesman', 'sliding', 'life', 'character', 'most', 'likely', 'step', 'up', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'ironically.A', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'along', 'helpful', 'movie', 'very', 'slowly', ""n't"", 'gain', 'much', 'speed', 'most', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'two', 'younger', 'stars', 'begin', 'affair', 'give', 'film', 'direction', 'momentum', 'awkward', 'best', 'focus', 'Peck', 'other', 'customers', 'loser', 'family', 'evicted', 'home', 'nonstarter', 'marriage', 'Kingsley', 'Janssen', 'Aside', 'Peck', 'difficult', 'care', 'anyone', 'film', 'think', 'what', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'others', 'seem', 'be', 'putting', 'forward']",N/A

His parents fight about money on a constant basis he is not popular in school & can't wait to move out. To fiinance this goal he comes up with a plan to become a drug dealer who pushes his product through an ice cream vendors pushcart. Starting to sound bizarre well it gets weirder. He's about to finish high school & hopes he graduates virginity too. That smoldering summer before college Luke deals with his world - weariness by trading his psychiatrist weed for extra therapy sessions. Jeffrey Squires (Ben Kingsley) an aging hipster takes the marijuana to to help him cope with his mess of a marriage & moody stepdaughter Stephanie (Olivia Thirlby)Spending time with Luke makes the bong tapping pill popping Dr. Squires feel his youth again. Hanging out with Dr Squires brings Luke closer to the ultra -desirable Stephanie. They are both terrified of the future but they both want to get laid. Like all the characters in this film, they misunderstand themselves & give each other the wrong advice, assistance, & friendship.Doctor & patient become pot-peddlin partners & the therapist - client relationship reverses polarity several times before the story is through. As Luke stretches himself in pursuit of his first real romance, Dr Squires regresses in juvenile behavior but learns like us all no matter how much money you spend or time you spend with the young you can't get back your youth.

For a first effort one must be impressed by Levine's skill at directing actors as well as working with the cinematographer. The Wackness has some beautiful visual scenes. But as a writer Levine has churned out but another typical Indie flick that will probably win a lot of awards at the film festivals but won't impress more sophisticated critics.Levine's coming of age tale is set in 1994. He sets the story in that time period in order to pad his soundtrack with various hip hop songs that were coming out at that time. Actually the story could have been set in the present and all the references to that time period seem self-conscious.Levine's characters are flat, bordering on one-dimensional. For the most part, they don't like themselves. The protagonist, Luke Shapiro, is continually seeing his mentor, a psychiatrist played by Ben Kingsley, and admitting that he is unhappy. Kingsley's character, Dr. Squires, is also unhappy, trapped in a loveless marriage. Sad sack characters are good for soap operas but do not make for good drama.Levine should have taken a cue from 'The Sopranos' and modeled his shrink on the very believable and confident 'Dr. Melfi'. Instead, Dr. Squires is a loser who trades therapy sessions for marijuana which Luke provides him with. Even less thought out are the supporting characters such as Luke's father who has managed to get the family evicted due to some unexplained business dealings. Similarly, Dr. Squire's wife spends her time bemoaning her poor relationship with the goofy doctor. That relationship is also never explored.Luke spends a good deal of time walking around the neighborhood pushing an ice cream cart loaded with marijuana. He does get arrested at one point but surprisingly not for selling marijuana (actually it's for making graffiti along with his unstable mentor, Dr. Squires).The main part of the story involves Luke's romance with Stephanie, Squires's step-daughter, convincingly played by Oliva Thirlby. She has the best part in the script, playing a cynical and amoral vixen who beds Luke and then discards him for the next heavier player that comes along.There are no surprises at the end of 'The Wackness'. Luke takes his lumps and heads for college, older but wiser. He manages to also set up Dr. Squires with an acquaintance who the writer hints will be a stabilizing influence on him in the future.Despite all the clich&eacute;s, Levine is a director who I am certain will go on to take on more challenging projects in the future.",2,Talented director churns out uninspired 90s soaper,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,2655,"['One', 'day', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'call', 'Jonathan', 'Levine', 'ask', 'direct', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'not', 'based', 'skills', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'director', 'first', 'effort', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'impressed', 'Levine', 'skill', 'directing', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'working', 'cinematographer', 'Wackness', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'scenes', 'writer', 'Levine', 'churned', 'out', 'typical', 'Indie', 'flick', 'will', 'probably', 'win', 'lot', 'awards', 'film', 'festivals', 'wo', ""n't"", 'impress', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'critics.Levine', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'set', '1994', 'story', 'time', 'period', 'order', 'pad', 'soundtrack', 'various', 'hip', 'hop', 'songs', 'were', 'coming', 'out', 'time', 'Actually', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'present', 'references', 'time', 'period', 'seem', 'self-conscious.Levine', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'bordering', 'one-dimensional', 'most', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'protagonist', 'Luke', 'Shapiro', 'continually', 'seeing', 'mentor', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'admitting', 'unhappy', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Squires', 'also', 'unhappy', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'Sad', 'sack', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'soap', 'operas', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'drama.Levine', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'cue', ""'The"", 'Sopranos', 'modeled', 'shrink', 'very', 'believable', 'confident', ""'Dr"", 'Melfi', 'Instead', 'Dr.', 'Squires', 'loser', 'who', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'marijuana', 'Luke', 'Even', 'less', 'thought', 'out', 'are', 'supporting', 'characters', 'such', 'Luke', 'father', 'who', 'managed', 'get', 'family', 'evicted', 'due', 'unexplained', 'business', 'dealings', 'Similarly', 'Dr.', 'Squire', 'wife', 'time', 'bemoaning', 'poor', 'relationship', 'goofy', 'doctor', 'relationship', 'also', 'never', 'explored.Luke', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'walking', 'neighborhood', 'pushing', 'ice', 'cream', 'cart', 'loaded', 'marijuana', 'get', 'arrested', 'one', 'point', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'selling', 'marijuana', 'actually', 'making', 'graffiti', 'unstable', 'mentor', 'Dr.', 'Squires', '.The', 'main', 'part', 'story', 'Luke', 'romance', 'Stephanie', 'Squires', 'step-daughter', 'convincingly', 'played', 'Oliva', 'Thirlby', 'best', 'part', 'script', 'playing', 'cynical', 'amoral', 'vixen', 'who', 'Luke', 'then', 'discards', 'next', 'heavier', 'player', 'along.There', 'are', 'surprises', 'end', ""'The"", 'Wackness', 'Luke', 'lumps', 'heads', 'college', 'older', 'wiser', 'also', 'set', 'up', 'Dr.', 'Squires', 'acquaintance', 'who', 'writer', 'hints', 'will', 'be', 'stabilizing', 'influence', 'future.Despite', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Levine', 'director', 'who', 'am', 'certain', 'will', 'go', 'take', 'more', 'challenging', 'projects', 'future']",N/A
