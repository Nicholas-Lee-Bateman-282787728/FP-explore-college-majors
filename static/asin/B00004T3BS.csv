The animation was so-so, and the music was alright (the bgm isn't that great, but the opening and closing themes are pretty good), and it had a good, origianl base for a story, but it lacked depth.  It also seemed to be detached, as if it were a child playing a game where he kept changing the rules to suit hisself.  Most of the episodes are like one-shot stories, almost, which would be okay if the series were longer....but it left no time for character or story development.  It did have a number of funny moments, though.  It's one of those series that gradually gets better as the end approaches.  It's a good deal though, i mean, all 12 episodes in one set for about $40.  I was just disappointed that it had no dubbed version, like most anime dvd's...this dvd only offered japanese with subtitles.  this didn't upset me too much, though, because i prefer subs....but it might frustrate dub fans.  but, i'd say it was enjoyable to watch, and was all around rather entertaining.  I would have liked to give it 3 1/2 stars, but its not an option....*OH MY GOD!*",3,"Kawaii, but lacks depth...",994723200,"07 10, 2001",2001,1124,"['Not', 'totally', 'cup', 'tea', 'was', 'cute', 'sweet', 'animation', 'was', 'so-so', 'music', 'was', 'alright', 'bgm', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'opening', 'closing', 'themes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'had', 'good', 'origianl', 'base', 'story', 'lacked', 'depth', 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'detached', 'were', 'child', 'playing', 'game', 'where', 'kept', 'changing', 'rules', 'suit', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'one-shot', 'stories', 'almost', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'series', 'were', 'longer', '.but', 'left', 'time', 'character', 'story', 'development', 'did', 'have', 'number', 'funny', 'moments', 'though', 'one', 'series', 'gradually', 'better', 'end', 'good', 'deal', 'i', 'mean', '12', 'episodes', 'one', 'set', '40', 'was', 'just', 'disappointed', 'had', 'dubbed', 'version', 'most', 'anime', 'dvd', 'only', 'offered', 'japanese', 'subtitles', 'did', ""n't"", 'upset', 'too', 'much', 'though', 'i', 'prefer', 'subs', 'might', 'frustrate', 'dub', 'fans', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'was', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'not', 'option', 'MY', 'GOD', '*']",N/A

Weakness: the cast and character  drawings (somehow their body proportions are out of balance). Also, it does  not (cannot due to the length) incorporate all the original setting in its  manga version. Due to this reason, this anime does not really have an  ending. They were supposed to fight with another high school's  &quot;Seitokai (student association)&quot;.Nevertheless, the anime  itself is still enjoyable. I'm really surprised that they put this on the  (US) market, it was a minor one and I've been looking for it for some time.  The reason: it's full of jokes that can keep you laugh all the time.By  the way, the Ninomiya is a &quot;legendary&quot; outstanding student in  ancient time, who use all his time to study. That is why many schools put  his scupture in their campuses, in order to promote a &quot;learning  organizaion&quot; climate. The story has explained Hanako and Akamanto.The author is good in writing stories related to ghosts/phantoms, most  of his titles talk about that.",4,This one is uncommon - in many aspects,966556800,"08 18, 2000",2000,1259,"['What', 'want', 'express', 'first', 'one', 'worst', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'CV', 'collection', 'still', 'love', 'serious.The', 'author', 'remix', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'school', 'ghost', 'stories', 'creative', 'ways', 'make', 'pretty', 'fresh', 'audience', 'Weakness', 'cast', 'character', 'drawings', 'somehow', 'body', 'proportions', 'are', 'balance', 'Also', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'due', 'length', 'incorporate', 'original', 'setting', 'manga', 'version', 'Due', 'reason', 'anime', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'ending', 'were', 'supposed', 'fight', 'high', 'school', 'quot', 'Seitokai', 'student', 'association', 'quot', 'anime', 'still', 'enjoyable', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'put', 'US', 'market', 'was', 'minor', 'one', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'time', 'reason', 'full', 'jokes', 'can', 'keep', 'time.By', 'way', 'Ninomiya', 'quot', 'legendary', 'quot', 'outstanding', 'student', 'ancient', 'time', 'who', 'use', 'time', 'study', 'why', 'many', 'schools', 'put', 'scupture', 'campuses', 'order', 'promote', 'quot', 'learning', 'organizaion', 'quot', 'climate', 'story', 'explained', 'Hanako', 'Akamanto.The', 'author', 'good', 'writing', 'stories', 'related', 'ghosts/phantoms', 'most', 'titles', 'talk']",N/A

This was one of the first anime DVD sets I purchased & I haven't regretted the purchase since. Unfortunately for the general public, this has long since gone out of print so copies are hard to come by & can occasionally be rather expensive.The story follows several teenagers as they go about their daily life in Saito High School as the student holy council. For council leader Houjou, the existence isn't exactly a peaceful one as he was tricked into joining because he's the son of a Christian minister & really only wants to have an incredibly average high school existence, find his sweetheart & go about his life.  His teammates are more open to the idea or at least to the bribery from the school principal.This is a pretty cute series, but I will say that this isn't one that you can really watch all at once. It's fun & it is zany, but it gets sort of old after a while. Some viewers might get turned off by some of the subject matter (a girl with a shotacon complex) & by the fact that the series has no real ending to it because the anime was made while the manga series was still ongoing. While the shotacon stuff is creepy, it fits in with the series tone, which is closer to a ghost hunting & anime parody at times than anything else.If you have some way of viewing one or two of the episodes before buying it, I really recommend doing so. This isn't a series that will appeal to everyone- especially since the animation is very dated by today's standards. (It was made in 1997.) It's not a timeless classic like some of the other anime series are, but it does appeal to a niche audience.",4,A good series that should come back into print!,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,1617,"['Ahhh', 'memories', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'anime', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'have', ""n't"", 'regretted', 'purchase', 'Unfortunately', 'general', 'public', 'long', 'gone', 'print', 'copies', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'can', 'occasionally', 'be', 'rather', 'expensive.The', 'story', 'several', 'teenagers', 'go', 'daily', 'life', 'Saito', 'High', 'School', 'student', 'holy', 'council', 'council', 'leader', 'Houjou', 'existence', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'peaceful', 'one', 'was', 'tricked', 'joining', 'son', 'Christian', 'minister', 'really', 'only', 'have', 'incredibly', 'average', 'high', 'school', 'existence', 'find', 'sweetheart', 'go', 'life', 'teammates', 'are', 'more', 'open', 'idea', 'least', 'bribery', 'school', 'principal.This', 'pretty', 'cute', 'series', 'will', 'say', ""n't"", 'one', 'can', 'really', 'watch', 'once', 'fun', 'zany', 'sort', 'old', 'while', 'viewers', 'might', 'get', 'turned', 'off', 'subject', 'matter', 'girl', 'shotacon', 'complex', 'fact', 'series', 'real', 'ending', 'anime', 'was', 'made', 'manga', 'series', 'was', 'still', 'ongoing', 'shotacon', 'stuff', 'creepy', 'series', 'tone', 'closer', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'anime', 'parody', 'times', 'anything', 'else.If', 'have', 'way', 'viewing', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'buying', 'really', 'recommend', 'doing', 'so', ""n't"", 'series', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone-', 'especially', 'animation', 'very', 'dated', 'today', 'standards', 'was', 'made', '1997', 'not', 'timeless', 'classic', 'other', 'anime', 'series', 'are', 'appeal', 'niche', 'audience']",N/A

Thus sums up the Haunted Junction series. This is a great, hilarious series, with an odd mixture of Human students (including a girl who LOVES young boys - you don't see THAT every day in anime!!!) and school spirits at a Tokyo high school with such a poor reputation and high level of spiritual energy that no one can transfer from the school and professional exorcists flee in terror at simply hearing the school's name.Now if only I had a Toilet Hanako in my apartment.....",4,"Great, Hilarious, Off-the-wall Anime :-)",996710400,"08 2, 2001",2001,631,"['How', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'credit', 'classes', 'never', 'take', 'converse', 'freely', 'supernatural', 'entities', 'have', 'new', 'comedy-filled', 'adventure', 'day', 'Thus', 'up', 'Haunted', 'Junction', 'series', 'great', 'hilarious', 'series', 'odd', 'mixture', 'Human', 'students', 'including', 'girl', 'who', 'LOVES', 'young', 'boys', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'day', 'anime', 'school', 'spirits', 'Tokyo', 'high', 'school', 'poor', 'reputation', 'high', 'level', 'spiritual', 'energy', 'one', 'can', 'transfer', 'school', 'professional', 'exorcists', 'flee', 'terror', 'simply', 'hearing', 'school', 'name.Now', 'only', 'had', 'Toilet', 'Hanako', 'apartment', '..']",N/A

The DVD however is kinda poor. First off, there is no English version. Only Japanese with subtitles. I'm not one to complain about this, but this makes many a victim in the dubbing versus subtitle war. Extras include character biographies, but thats about it. Anyway, even if this DVD isn't at full potenetial, its still a great value for 12 episodes. However, if you haven't seen it yet, I recommend seeing a VHS version first and then decide on this DVD.

I wasn't expecting a great deal due to this, but I was  wrong! The story itself is in many ways different from what can be  considered the mainstream anime seen today. It covers subjects whilst being  totally at home in the Japanese culture, receive a mixed reception in the  western world. The series is well constructed, and putting aside the  animation which maybe is not as good as some of the other mainstream works,  it's funny as hell, another series full of humour and one liners, a light  tale of high school life (with ghosts and spirits.) If you like the Burn Up  series or Tenchi Muyo, then this collection is probably for you. It may not  be the best quality in the world, but really who cares about perfection,  it's good enough in that department, but excels in the story and humour  departments, which is where it really counts. Plus as mentioned earlier the  collection is good value, containing the full 12 episodes on two disks,  none of the dreaded 3 episodes per disk and wait three months for the next  instalment here!
