This movie is why movies are made in the first place. James Caan and Billy Dee Williams turn in powerful performances as Brian's Song is impossible to watch without any stirring of feelings. That is, it is a very emotional film to watch. There is a plethora of great scenes that Brian's Song special, but one scene remains the best is when James Caan and Billy Dee Williams are running together in a slow motion as they gasp for air. Looking at James Caan, that moment became powerful as it is very symbolic; that resonates the meaning of Brian's Song. Buzz Kulik, although possessing very short resume, has earned the distinction of making a great classic, surprisingly for me to see that it was intended to be made for TV, because Brian's Song halted the idea of itself being a football film and transcended to the idea something else more important than just sports only. I can't think of a stronger and more powerful film that carried the message of friendship, loyalty, and character than Brian's Song. One of the most emotionally moving cinema pictures, Brian's Song remains to this day a difficult film to watch but forever memorable and thrilling. The ending is endearingly impacting as the final words summing up about Brian Piccolo honestly show the kind of a man he was. It's a very sad film and difficult to sit through without being emotional, but still I am buoyed by the great sense of humor precipitated in Brian's Song. It's the acting of James Caan and Billy Dee Williams that gets me so many times. If anything, James Caan will always be remembered for playing Brian Piccolo. In Brian's Song, I loved the racial equality or more, the celebration of two men of different color to bond together.4/12: Brian's Song is a timeless classic that triumphs over racial inequality. It is also a film that mocks racism. Even Dr. Martin Luther king, Jr. would have been proud of it. Billy Dee Williams and James Caan will forever be remembered as Gale Sayers and Brian Piccolo. The ending is as sad as it gets. All in all, Brian's Song proves that a made-for-TV can work better than an overblown film with a vast budget.",5,"Say It Ain't So, Jimmy Caan!",1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,2265,"['Viewed', '8/03', '10/04', '2/05', '5/06', '4/12Rate', '105/06', 'rate', 'Brian', 'Song', 'lower', '10', 'crazy', 'Brian', 'Song', 'film', 'lifetime', 'movie', 'why', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'first', 'place', 'James', 'Caan', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'turn', 'powerful', 'performances', 'Brian', 'Song', 'impossible', 'watch', 'stirring', 'feelings', 'very', 'emotional', 'film', 'watch', 'plethora', 'great', 'scenes', 'Brian', 'Song', 'special', 'one', 'scene', 'best', 'when', 'James', 'Caan', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'are', 'running', 'together', 'slow', 'motion', 'gasp', 'air', 'Looking', 'James', 'Caan', 'moment', 'became', 'powerful', 'very', 'symbolic', 'meaning', 'Brian', 'Song', 'Buzz', 'Kulik', 'possessing', 'very', 'short', 'resume', 'earned', 'distinction', 'making', 'great', 'classic', 'surprisingly', 'see', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'made', 'TV', 'Brian', 'Song', 'halted', 'idea', 'being', 'football', 'film', 'transcended', 'idea', 'something', 'else', 'more', 'important', 'just', 'sports', 'only', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'stronger', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'carried', 'message', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'character', 'Brian', 'Song', 'One', 'most', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'cinema', 'pictures', 'Brian', 'Song', 'day', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'forever', 'memorable', 'thrilling', 'ending', 'endearingly', 'impacting', 'final', 'words', 'summing', 'up', 'about', 'Brian', 'Piccolo', 'honestly', 'show', 'kind', 'man', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'film', 'difficult', 'sit', 'being', 'emotional', 'still', 'am', 'buoyed', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'precipitated', 'Brian', 'Song', 'acting', 'James', 'Caan', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'anything', 'James', 'Caan', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'playing', 'Brian', 'Piccolo', 'Brian', 'Song', 'loved', 'racial', 'equality', 'more', 'celebration', 'two', 'men', 'different', 'color', 'bond', 'together.4/12', 'Brian', 'Song', 'timeless', 'classic', 'triumphs', 'racial', 'inequality', 'also', 'film', 'racism', 'Even', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'king', 'Jr.', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'James', 'Caan', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'remembered', 'Gale', 'Sayers', 'Brian', 'Piccolo', 'ending', 'as', 'sad', 'Brian', 'Song', 'made-for-TV', 'can', 'work', 'better', 'overblown', 'film', 'vast', 'budget']",Brian's Song VHS

335687,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,6302797713,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[2, 3]","`Brian's Song', the true story of Brian Piccolo and his fight against cancer, is one of the most critically acclaimed `made for TV' movies ever released.  This is due mostly to the heroic story and the acting chops of Mr. James Caan.  The film, chronicling the relationship between two football players for the Chicago Bears, one white and one black, showcases these two men as they bond over the course of time.  Brian (Caan) helps his teammate Gale Sayers (Billy Dee Williams) when he's injured during a game and is in need of physical therapy to heal his knee.  Likewise, when Brian is diagnosed with malignant cancer Gale is there by his bedside giving him emotional support, helping him put up his fight against his latest opponent.  Brian's fight was lost, but his story lives on.  The film is based on the novel `I am third' taken from the fact that Brian was always second (or even third) choice on the team, always being one of the best, but never `the' best due to players like Sayers.  The acting in this film is a bit lacking, although Caan giving yet another terrific performance, and Shelly Fabares does a fine job as Julie, Brian's loving wife, but Williams performance as the shy and reserved Sayers is a bit forced, and his breakdown in the locker upon hearing of Brian's condition is completely unbelievable.  Caan is an acting legend, and releasing this just before his brilliant turn in `The Godfather' was sure to get him noticed.  This film has been remade before, and the story has not changed, but it's Caan's Brian that I'll always remember.",4,"""We're going to put you to sleep now...""",1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,1566,"['Brian', 'Song', 'true', 'story', 'Brian', 'Piccolo', 'fight', 'cancer', 'one', 'most', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'ever', 'released', 'due', 'mostly', 'heroic', 'story', 'acting', 'chops', 'Mr.', 'James', 'Caan', 'film', 'chronicling', 'relationship', 'two', 'football', 'players', 'Chicago', 'Bears', 'one', 'white', 'one', 'black', 'two', 'men', 'bond', 'course', 'time', 'Brian', 'Caan', 'teammate', 'Gale', 'Sayers', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'when', 'injured', 'game', 'need', 'physical', 'therapy', 'heal', 'knee', 'Likewise', 'when', 'Brian', 'diagnosed', 'malignant', 'cancer', 'Gale', 'there', 'bedside', 'giving', 'emotional', 'support', 'helping', 'put', 'up', 'fight', 'latest', 'opponent', 'Brian', 'fight', 'was', 'lost', 'story', 'lives', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'am', 'third', 'taken', 'fact', 'Brian', 'was', 'always', 'second', 'even', 'third', 'choice', 'team', 'always', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'never', 'best', 'due', 'players', 'Sayers', 'acting', 'film', 'bit', 'lacking', 'Caan', 'giving', 'yet', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Shelly', 'Fabares', 'fine', 'job', 'Julie', 'Brian', 'loving', 'wife', 'Williams', 'performance', 'shy', 'reserved', 'Sayers', 'bit', 'forced', 'breakdown', 'locker', 'hearing', 'Brian', 'condition', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'Caan', 'acting', 'legend', 'releasing', 'just', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'Godfather', 'was', 'sure', 'get', 'noticed', 'film', 'been', 'remade', 'story', 'not', 'changed', 'Caan', 'Brian', ""'ll"", 'always', 'remember']",Brian's Song VHS

This is a very tough movie to review for me because no words I put down can really do the film justice. It really takes a lot to make me cry but this movie really had me reaching for the tissues by the handfuls.PLOT:This is really at it's core an old-fashioned story about friendship; the friendship between to pro-football players: Brian Piccolo(James Caan) and Gale Sayers(Billy Dee Williams. Both play for the Chicago Bears and both play the same position. They start as rivals but quickly become friends after their coach, George Halas(Jack Warden), rooms the players together by the position they play. Later Gale gets injured and it's Brian who works Gale back into shape and encourages him back in the game. Then Brian starts losing weight and coughing a lot and getting slower so the coach sends him to the doctor. We discover that Brian has cancer. Through it all Gale sticks by Brian's side and we see what true friendship is all about.CAST:James Caan(Brian Piccolo): Caan has gave a lot of great performances in his career but he has never topped this one. He is so full of energy and love for life that we truly care about this man and his fate. Caan gave one THE greatest acting performances ever in this film and his last scene still hasn't been topped for sheer emotional power.Billy Dee Williams(Gale Sayers): Williams gave his best performance in this film too. He starts out shy and slowly starts to become more outgoing with Brian's help. He made me cry almost as much as Brian did with his two speeches: one to the team when he finds out Brian's sick and the other when gets the Courageous Player Award.Jack Warden(George Halas): This is one of Warden's best performances as well. It's a close tie with his performance in 12 Angry Men. I especially loved his narration at the beginning and end of the film.Shelley Fabares(Joy Piccolo): I don't know anything about this actress other than that she gave a great performance as Brian's wife. When she goes over to Brian after Gale walks back to his wife it is one of the saddest, most heartbreaking scenes ever filmed between her and Caan.CONTENT: A few minor curse words are all that would be here to offend anyone and some racist remarks but they aren't really meant to be offensive though some may take them that way. Also the subject matter may be to mature for some younger viewers.EXTRAS: The excellent score by Michel Legrand is enough by itself to make your eyes water.FINAL WORD: One of the greatest saddest and most emotionally powrful movies ever.

335694,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302797713,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","On the accompanying commentary track, Billy Dee Williams facetiously trivialized this movie as ""a nice story about two guys who weren't gay."" I can't believe it's been 34 years since I first saw it as a 1971 ABC Movie of the Week. I remember crying like a baby and talking about it with my classmates at school the day after. All these years later, this moving film still makes me tear up. At a mere 73 minutes, it tells the now-familiar story of Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers, who both joined the Chicago Bears as running backs in 1965. While Sayers proved to be the superior player, Piccolo persevered with good humor and integrity as he helped Sayers recover from a potentially career-ending knee injury. The story is really about how they support and sustain each other, and when Piccolo develops lung cancer, it falls on Sayers to help him through as much as he can. Much of the film's power comes from William Blinn, who wrote a heartfelt, sometimes funny story about friendship and mutual respect without falling into cheap sentimentality, and credit obviously goes to veteran TV director Buzz Kulik, who guides this film expertly to unexpected emotional depths.The two leads are stellar, and the chemistry between them near-perfect. On the verge of stardom as hothead Sonny Corleone in ""The Godfather"", James Caan portrays Piccolo as a genuinely likable, funny and determined guy who is convinced he will beat the odds. I doubt if he has played a role since with more emotional honesty, and in such a brief running time, he makes you care deeply about his character. With quiet strength and few words, Williams captures Sayers' initial reticence and increasing bond with Piccolo. In fact, he is responsible for two of the film's most heartbreaking scenes, both where Sayers needed to get out of his awkward comfort zone, first when he tells his teammates in the locker room that Piccolo is sick and then at the second awards banquet when he says with a lack of irony how he loves Piccolo. You are complete stone if you are not moved by these scenes. Jack Warden shows his dependably solid mix of macho gruffness and caring sensitivity as coach George Halas. The wives understandably take a back seat in the story with a post-Elvis era Shelley Fabares effective in her brief scenes as Joy Piccolo and Judy Pace even more in the background as Linda Sayers. Lending welcome realism, several Chicago Bears played themselves, including legendary linebacker Dick Butkus (before he became a TV actor), and the movie smartly includes archival footage of the real Piccolo and Sayers on the field. The beautiful, soaring music by Michel Legrand resonates still, especially the instantly familiar title theme. Keep in mind that ""Brian's Song"" was a TV-movie (still a concept in its infancy in 1971) made on the cheap with simple, reused sets and periodic fadeouts for the commercials that aired back then. I even recognized the Sayers house as Darrin and Samantha's house from ""Bewitched"". And truth be told, Caan and Williams looked more like track stars than football players. But the movie transcends those limitations in ways the producers could not have anticipated.Watching the movie with the commentary by Caan and Williams yields an almost entirely different experience, comically irreverent as if two fraternity brothers reunited. While Williams gets more sentimental about the experience, Caan is flat-out funny as he talks about his fantasy to become a Chicago Bear, how much more athletic he was compared to Williams (which both agree was true), commenting on their physiques at the time, and even speculating some people like Blinn and actor David Huddleston were dead (in fact, they aren't according to imdb.com).

335699,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6302797713,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 1]","I recently screened the original BRIAN'S SONG for a film series on ""Friendship In Film.""  It's not easy to find American films that explore that theme on a deeper level than the typical buddy-buddy flick.  There are any number of films out there about deep and  lasting friendships between women, but male friendship has been significantly less attention paid to it--understandable given the still strong cultural taboos against men expressing emotions and the implicit fear that too strong an emotional bond between men might imply at least latent homosexuality.This 1971 made-for-TV movie can be seen as something of a cultural watershed, in a way.  I actually missed the original broadcast back in the day (I was away at college and had other concerns), but I do recall that it was something of a media event. And understandably so.  When the cinematic Gale Sayers, receiving an award for ""Most Courageous Athlete,"" announces that his gallant teammate and friend, the mortally ill Brian Piccolo is infinitely more deserving of that award and that he (Sayers) will present it to him personally the next day,  well, there's not a dry eye in the auditorium--or, for that matter, in any of the millions of living rooms where the film is being viewed.  And when he expresses his love for his dying friend, well, no one's going to misinterpret that statement.Is it easier to express such sentiments about someone who's dead or dying?  Probably.  BRIAN'S SONG actually is kind of predictably buddy-buddy for the first hour or so.  Like many male friends, these guys express their affection for each other by bantering back and forth and playing silly practical jokes.  Viewers understand from the get go, of course, that a deeper bond is being forged, one that transcends race, or the fact of their sports rivalry, or of their decidedly different personalities.But it does take personal tragedy for that affection to be articulated.  Some might find that something of a shame.  Others will just say that's just the way things are (or WERE back in those storied days of those  yore).  BRIAN'S SONG, like most bio-flicks--and ESPECIALLY like most bioflicks on TV--is often frustratingly sketchy.  But it does make plain an implicit truth found in many close friendships between men.  The bonds are not just superficial--even when the banter mainly is.I recently did a solo performance of the old Louis Armstrong song ""Wonderful World"" in my church, and was struck anew by the lyrics, ""I see friends shaking hands, saying, 'How do you do?'/They're really saying, 'I love you.'""  In the case of Brian Piccolo, when he learns that his good friend has donated a pint of blood to him, what comes out of his mouth is, ""Well, no wonder I woke up with a craving for chitlins.""  But we know he's really sayin'  ""I love you.""And ""THANK YOU!""",4,Thank You For Being A Friend,1227312000,"11 22, 2008",2008,2825,"['recently', 'screened', 'original', 'BRIAN', 'SONG', 'film', 'series', 'Friendship', 'Film', 'not', 'easy', 'find', 'American', 'films', 'explore', 'theme', 'deeper', 'level', 'typical', 'buddy-buddy', 'flick', 'are', 'number', 'films', 'there', 'deep', 'lasting', 'friendships', 'women', 'male', 'friendship', 'been', 'significantly', 'less', 'attention', 'paid', 'understandable', 'given', 'still', 'strong', 'cultural', 'taboos', 'men', 'expressing', 'emotions', 'implicit', 'fear', 'too', 'strong', 'emotional', 'bond', 'men', 'might', 'imply', 'least', 'latent', 'homosexuality.This', '1971', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'something', 'cultural', 'watershed', 'way', 'actually', 'missed', 'original', 'broadcast', 'back', 'day', 'was', 'away', 'college', 'had', 'other', 'concerns', 'do', 'recall', 'was', 'something', 'media', 'event', 'understandably', 'so', 'When', 'cinematic', 'Gale', 'Sayers', 'receiving', 'award', 'Most', 'Courageous', 'Athlete', 'gallant', 'teammate', 'friend', 'mortally', 'ill', 'Brian', 'Piccolo', 'infinitely', 'more', 'deserving', 'award', 'Sayers', 'will', 'present', 'personally', 'next', 'day', 'well', 'not', 'dry', 'eye', 'auditorium', 'matter', 'millions', 'living', 'rooms', 'where', 'film', 'being', 'viewed', 'when', 'love', 'dying', 'friend', 'well', 'one', 'going', 'misinterpret', 'statement.Is', 'easier', 'express', 'such', 'sentiments', 'someone', 'who', 'dead', 'dying', 'Probably', 'BRIAN', 'SONG', 'actually', 'kind', 'predictably', 'buddy-buddy', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'many', 'male', 'friends', 'guys', 'express', 'affection', 'other', 'bantering', 'back', 'forth', 'playing', 'silly', 'practical', 'jokes', 'Viewers', 'understand', 'get', 'go', 'course', 'deeper', 'bond', 'being', 'forged', 'one', 'race', 'fact', 'sports', 'rivalry', 'decidedly', 'different', 'personalities.But', 'take', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'affection', 'be', 'articulated', 'might', 'find', 'something', 'shame', 'Others', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'just', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'WERE', 'back', 'storied', 'days', 'yore', 'BRIAN', 'SONG', 'most', 'bio-flicks', 'ESPECIALLY', 'most', 'bioflicks', 'TV', 'often', 'frustratingly', 'sketchy', 'make', 'plain', 'implicit', 'truth', 'found', 'many', 'close', 'friendships', 'men', 'bonds', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'superficial', 'even', 'when', 'banter', 'mainly', 'recently', 'did', 'solo', 'performance', 'old', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'song', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'church', 'was', 'struck', 'anew', 'lyrics', 'see', 'friends', 'shaking', 'hands', 'saying', ""'How"", 'do', 'do', ""'/They"", ""'re"", 'really', 'saying', 'love', 'case', 'Brian', 'Piccolo', 'when', 'good', 'friend', 'donated', 'pint', 'blood', 'what', 'out', 'mouth', 'Well', 'wonder', 'woke', 'up', 'craving', 'chitlins', 'know', 'really', 'sayin', 'love', 'THANK', 'YOU']",Brian's Song VHS

It did so with such a powerful stir as well.Guys crying at or watching a movie was never heard of, but for weeks afterwards, my teammates and other friends admitted to crying when we all discovered that ""Pic"" had cancer and especially when he was told after an operation that he still did.This is the first of many James Caan great acts.  The week before the Superbowl this year one of the networks showcased the foundations for cancer run by the families of Brian Piccolo and Walter Peyton.  It was amazing seeing old news footage and videos of Brian with his wife.  Caan and Fabresze looked just like them.The movie really broke a lot of ground. First, a white and a black player sharing hotel rooms on the road.  Even coach Hallas warned them that there may be trouble.  But these two, who vied for the same position, would become the best of friends.Piccolo even ups the ante when Sayers gets injured working with him to get back to playing.  Brian tells him that since he was second team, he did not want to be first team if Sayers could not play.  He told him he was going to beat him at his best and they worked together to get Sayers back in playing shape.Eventually, they both start in the backfield and they are elated.Brian's illness comes on quickly, yet you feel the sadness and the suffering of all around him.After the movie I found the book written by Gayle Sayers entitled; ""I am Third.""  The movie was based on Sayers autobiography.  For anyone interested in playing sports at any level, this book is a must and is related to the movie for sure.The movie shows that the ultimate of teamwork is working together and sacrificing for one another.

I am talking the original movie here with James Caan and Billy Dee Williams. The new version doesn't even come close. I couldn't even finish watching it because I couldn't stop comparing it against the original. Also, the new version glossed over the fact that when Brian and Gale were paired as roommates, it was the first time ever in football that a white man and a black man were roommates and it generated a lot of bigotry at the time, as well as shining a much-needed spotlight on the issue of prejudice. Minimizing the race issue with 21st century ""political correctness"" is just sweeping it under the rug, our dirty little secret. The original version brought out the fact that this was history in the making in more ways than one and the Brian/Gale partnership did much to ease race relations in sports.",5,Buy the original - there is no comparison,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,1516,"['do', ""n't"", 'like', 'football', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'football', 'movies', 'was', 'forced', 'watch', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'ever', 'right', 'was', 'not', 'dry', 'eye', 'class', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'have', 'counted', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'past', 'mumblety-mumble', 'years', 'list', 'three', 'football', 'movies', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'Brian', 'Song', 'Rudy', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Did', 'notice', 'none', 'are', 'football', 'three', 'are', 'friendship', 'fairness', 'rightness', 'triumphing', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'how', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'football', 'only', 'backdrop', 'set', 'exemplary', 'story', 'am', 'talking', 'original', 'movie', 'here', 'James', 'Caan', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'new', 'version', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'comparing', 'original', 'Also', 'new', 'version', 'glossed', 'fact', 'when', 'Brian', 'Gale', 'were', 'paired', 'roommates', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'football', 'white', 'man', 'black', 'man', 'were', 'roommates', 'generated', 'lot', 'bigotry', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'shining', 'much-needed', 'spotlight', 'issue', 'prejudice', 'Minimizing', 'race', 'issue', '21st', 'century', 'political', 'correctness', 'just', 'sweeping', 'rug', 'dirty', 'little', 'secret', 'original', 'version', 'brought', 'out', 'fact', 'was', 'history', 'making', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Brian/Gale', 'partnership', 'did', 'much', 'ease', 'race', 'relations', 'sports']",Brian's Song VHS

Brian & Gale were rookies together in 1965, both running backs and great college football players. They became the first black and white players to room together on the Bears. It's hard to believe it was only 40 years ago and many teams still had not broken the racial barriers off the field. I remember watching it on TV when it first aired and it was as good or better the 2nd time. Their friendship transcended their racial difference and their competition for the same position into a genuine love and respect for each other. As Gale experiences a potential career ending injury and Brian is diagnosed with cancer, their friendship grows into something very special. The selflessness of Brian helping Gale to recover from his injury which will ultimately put him back on the bench after replacing Gale is an inspiration.

But I'd never seen it until I rented it recently. I didn't realize that until Piccolo and Sayres became roommates, that this hadn't been done before in the NFL, and that they were the first.The movie follows Piccolo and Sayres from their first encounter at a team training camp through their team try-out and first year with the team, which was quite successful for both of them, especially Sayres. We see the friendship between the two players develop and how they encouraged and helped each other through the rough spots, the good times and the bad, of a professional ballplayer's life. When Sayres, after a brilliant start to the season, suffers a severe knee injury, Piccolo challenges the discouraged Sayres to overcome the injury. Through intensive physical therapy and training (and spurred on by Piccolo, who refuses to take no for answer), Sayres recovers and returns to the field.In some ways the film seems a little dated now; for example, the dying scene hasn't really held up that well, but overall, it's still a heartwarming film about the relationship between two very different friends. Sayres is shy and retiring and a man of few words, whereas Piccolo is much more extraverted and talkative, but they still became friends and supported each other through the ups and downs of their all too brief but in many ways inspiring friendship and relationship. Last but not least, Jack Warden is good as the savvy and benevolent coach who helps Piccolo and Sayres over some of the rough spots and really has their best interests at heart.",4,A few comments,1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,1669,"['movie', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'loved', 'made-for-TV-films', 'decade', 'fact', 'won', '5', 'Emmy', 'awards', 'remember', 'right', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'rented', 'recently', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Piccolo', 'Sayres', 'became', 'roommates', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'NFL', 'were', 'first.The', 'movie', 'Piccolo', 'Sayres', 'first', 'encounter', 'team', 'training', 'camp', 'team', 'try-out', 'first', 'year', 'team', 'was', 'quite', 'successful', 'especially', 'Sayres', 'see', 'friendship', 'two', 'players', 'develop', 'how', 'encouraged', 'helped', 'other', 'rough', 'spots', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'professional', 'ballplayer', 'life', 'When', 'Sayres', 'brilliant', 'start', 'season', 'severe', 'knee', 'injury', 'Piccolo', 'discouraged', 'Sayres', 'overcome', 'injury', 'intensive', 'physical', 'therapy', 'training', 'spurred', 'Piccolo', 'who', 'take', 'answer', 'recovers', 'returns', 'field.In', 'ways', 'film', 'little', 'dated', 'now', 'example', 'dying', 'scene', ""n't"", 'really', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'overall', 'still', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'friends', 'Sayres', 'shy', 'retiring', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'whereas', 'Piccolo', 'much', 'more', 'extraverted', 'talkative', 'still', 'became', 'friends', 'supported', 'other', 'ups', 'downs', 'too', 'brief', 'many', 'ways', 'inspiring', 'friendship', 'relationship', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'good', 'savvy', 'benevolent', 'coach', 'who', 'Piccolo', 'Sayres', 'rough', 'spots', 'really', 'best', 'interests', 'heart']",Brian's Song VHS

I want to be a sports writer and it's stuff that Brian's Song that makes me want to do it even more.Brian's Song is based on the true story of Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers. Both were rookies when they joined the Chicago Bears. Brian Piccolo(Caan) was the funny loudmouth that everybody loved. He wans't the most gifted athlete in the world and his determination made him the player that he was. Gale Sayers(Williams) was the quiet one. He was the easily the most talented player on the team maybe in the league. The two are paired as roomates and the friendship starts.The two are opposites and don't get along that well at first. Opposites attract and they especially do with these two. They quickly feed off each other though and become the best of friends. They fuel each other and are inspeperable. They become the first white and black roomates in the NFL. They ignore the whole idea of race and are like brothers.When Sayers tears his ACL the next year Brain gets the chance to step up and show his talent. He however feels for his friend and is determined to get Gale back into his form as the best RB in the league. There bond becomes even stronger during this time as does the friendship of there families.The tide changes though when Brian starts not to play well. It's a new season and the two are enjoying finally playing with each other as one of the best backfields in the league. Brians play starts to diminsh though and he's sent to the doctor. What the doctor finds is that Brian has cancer and is terminal. It's now up to Gale to help his friend through this most difficult time of his life.This movie isn't about football. It's about the bond of love and friendship that these two men have for each other. James Caan and Billy Dee Williams play these roles to perfection. Both weren't known all that well at this time in 1971. Caan hadn't delivered his legendary performance as Sonny Corleone and Wiliams hadn't played Lando yet. The two give dramatic performances though that are sure to make anybody cry.This is one of the greatest tear jerkers of all time. I've never wathced it were a member of the audience isn't sobbing at the end of it. I've cried numerous times while watching this movie.You can tell it's a tv made movie. It doesn't take away from the quality though and this movie cleaned the Emmy's out in 1971 and in my opinion is the greatest made for TV movie EVER!I love this movie. It's not about sports but is about life. You won't find a better tale of love and friendship anywhere. Everybody should see this movie at one time or another. It's a cinematic masterpiece.

That is most likely the case but whatever the reason be, this continues to be my favorite story of all time. The newer version seems to be more emotional and bring about more sorrow which is why I liked it more. It made you feel for Brian Piccolo more as he goes through his trying times. As for those who don't know the story, Brian is a football player who contracts cancer. His enemy turned friend, teammate, and competitor, Gale helps Brian and his wife through the pain of dealing with cancer and this is truly the saddest movie I have ever seen. The new version brought about tears at more than one point in the movie, and it takes a lot for me to cry during a movie. (This is still the only movie to this date that has actually made me cry) A definite classic that everyone should own. I will recommend the newer version based on my opinion, but I don't think it matters which one because this story has captured the love and emotion of those in my parents generation as well as those in my generation who have watched the newer version.

The movie centers around the quiet and reserved superstar running back Gale Sayers and his good and selfless outgoing friend Brian Piccolo, who is used to being in the wrong place at the wrong time in terms of getting noticed. When Sayers suffers a terrible knee injury, it is Piccolo who wants Sayers to heal and resume his great career because Piccolo doesn't want to be someone who gains the #1 string the easy way. Piccolo inspires Sayers to work hard to rehabilitate his knee, which he does. Meanwhile, Piccolo's performance on the field noticeably falters, and it turns out that he has cancer. Now Sayers is the one who is the rock and support that the other needs, and is by Piccolo's side throughout his illness. This film came out at a time when race was a huge social issue, yet it shows how Sayers and Piccolo had no issues whatsoever when it came to race relations. Their time as roommates caused a stir that would never occur today. In the end, this movie ultimately puts life and its trials and tribulations into proper perspective.
