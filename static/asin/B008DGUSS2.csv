It's very funny and entertaining. Then something happens in the second half, as the film turns somewhat serious. It didn't work and lost a lot of its entertainment value to me. The performances are all top-notch, though. Barry Bostwick has an amusing cameo as a priest. As of late, Bostwick has been making a comeback as a horror-comedy icon, also starring in the recent Some Guy Who Kills People and the upcoming FDR: American Badass. The Selling isn't as great as it had the potential to be, but it's still worth a look.",3,Almost Had Me Sold,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,642,"['Selling', 'horror-comedy', 'terrific', 'first', 'half', 'homage', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'movies', 'very', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'Then', 'something', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'somewhat', 'serious', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'lost', 'lot', 'entertainment', 'value', 'performances', 'are', 'top-notch', 'though', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'amusing', 'cameo', 'priest', 'late', 'Bostwick', 'been', 'making', 'comeback', 'horror-comedy', 'icon', 'also', 'starring', 'recent', 'Guy', 'Who', 'Kills', 'People', 'upcoming', 'FDR', 'American', 'Badass', 'Selling', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'still', 'worth', 'look']",N/A

1550903,A1UMHCRVZQWQER,B008DGUSS2,"HillBuzz dot ORG ""HillBuzz dot ORG""","[1, 2]","I have to say that I really liked the first 35 minutes of ""The Selling"".  I am a big haunted house fan and am always looking for a new take on that niche in horror movies...the first 35 minutes of this actually reminded me a little of an old Simpsons ""Treehouse of Horror"" where a haunted house tried to get the Simpsons to leave, only they wouldn't.  I really liked the idea of seeing what realtors would do with a haunted house situation.  Novel concept.I like independent movies but they have a tendency to run a little long and always seem to fall apart at the end; I think they also lack good editors.  That seems to be the case with ""The Selling"" as well.  If I had to guess, I bet the people behind this pitched the great idea of ""what happens to a haunted house when someone tries to sell it"" and they got the greenlight to make the movie...but then they realized they had to fill out another 30 minutes to make it feature length.  And so they sort of scrambled and threw anything they could think of at the end.But, I'll say that the first 35 minutes were good enough for me to be happy I rented this.  I don't regret it at all.",4,I really enjoyed the first 35 minutes of this...and then it kind of fell apart,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,1137,"['have', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'first', '35', 'minutes', 'Selling', 'am', 'big', 'haunted', 'house', 'fan', 'am', 'always', 'looking', 'new', 'take', 'niche', 'horror', 'movies', 'first', '35', 'minutes', 'actually', 'reminded', 'little', 'old', 'Simpsons', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', 'where', 'haunted', 'house', 'tried', 'get', 'Simpsons', 'leave', 'only', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'liked', 'idea', 'seeing', 'what', 'realtors', 'would', 'do', 'haunted', 'house', 'situation', 'Novel', 'concept.I', 'independent', 'movies', 'have', 'tendency', 'run', 'little', 'long', 'always', 'seem', 'fall', 'apart', 'end', 'think', 'also', 'lack', 'good', 'editors', 'be', 'case', 'Selling', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'guess', 'bet', 'people', 'pitched', 'great', 'idea', 'what', 'haunted', 'house', 'when', 'someone', 'sell', 'got', 'greenlight', 'make', 'movie', 'then', 'realized', 'had', 'fill', 'out', '30', 'minutes', 'make', 'feature', 'length', 'so', 'sort', 'scrambled', 'threw', 'anything', 'could', 'think', 'end.But', ""'ll"", 'say', 'first', '35', 'minutes', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'happy', 'rented', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A

Not sure why they felt it necessary to send the film south when it was so good without it.

1550905,A16280G4A02REI,B008DGUSS2,"Jeffrey Getzin ""Jeffrey Getzin""","[1, 5]","This film has an irresistible premise: a pair of real estate agents trying to flip a haunted house. It offers a great opportunity to spoof the haunted house genre, and it tries its best to do so.However, the film is uneven, as though desperately searching for a consistent tone. The actors seem skilled, but their performances are hammy: deliberate, perhaps? I felt like there were ""too many notes""; it just felt prolonged and labored in places. It also was incredibly predictable, and I was able to predict nearly every gag.I say ""nearly"" because this movie has a precious few genuine laugh-out-loud moments that caught me by surprise. I saw this on my laptop during my commute home, and I know I must have annoyed the guy sitting next to me with my occasional chortle, snort, or general-purpose laugh.Also in the Pro column is that the main characters are generally likable and amusing, except for the ones you're not supposed to like. However, they felt thin, even for an entry in the send-up genre.Overall, I think that some customers might enjoy watching this movie for some nice, relaxing entertainment. It probably would be more fun if served with a bottle of wine. The film is light-hearted fluff, with no real elements of sex, violence, or even scares.I do think the writer, director, and cast have serious potential, and while I didn't think they gelled very well in this particular film, I'd be interested in seeing their future efforts.",2,A few solid laughs keeps this from being a total waste,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,1448,"['film', 'irresistible', 'premise', 'pair', 'real', 'estate', 'agents', 'trying', 'flip', 'haunted', 'house', 'great', 'opportunity', 'spoof', 'haunted', 'house', 'genre', 'best', 'do', 'so.However', 'film', 'uneven', 'desperately', 'searching', 'consistent', 'tone', 'actors', 'seem', 'skilled', 'performances', 'are', 'hammy', 'deliberate', 'perhaps', 'felt', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'notes', 'just', 'felt', 'prolonged', 'labored', 'places', 'also', 'was', 'incredibly', 'predictable', 'was', 'able', 'predict', 'nearly', 'gag.I', 'say', 'nearly', 'movie', 'precious', 'few', 'genuine', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'caught', 'surprise', 'saw', 'laptop', 'commute', 'home', 'know', 'must', 'have', 'annoyed', 'guy', 'sitting', 'next', 'occasional', 'chortle', 'snort', 'general-purpose', 'laugh.Also', 'Pro', 'column', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'likable', 'amusing', 'ones', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'like', 'However', 'felt', 'thin', 'even', 'entry', 'send-up', 'genre.Overall', 'think', 'customers', 'might', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'nice', 'relaxing', 'entertainment', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'fun', 'served', 'bottle', 'wine', 'film', 'light-hearted', 'fluff', 'real', 'elements', 'sex', 'violence', 'even', 'scares.I', 'do', 'think', 'writer', 'director', 'cast', 'have', 'serious', 'potential', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'gelled', 'very', 'well', 'particular', 'film', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'future', 'efforts']",N/A
