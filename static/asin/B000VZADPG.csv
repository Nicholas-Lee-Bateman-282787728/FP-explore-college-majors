Is it Tyler Perry's fault that lower-income people don't have discriminating senses of humor? Nyet. Is it Tyler Perry's fault that watching these programs will lower your IQ while it entertains you? Not on your life, buster.Tyler Perry is giving the audience WHAT THEY WANT. You and your educated ways and your East Coast academic mindset aren't in vogue anymore. So take that college degree, set it on fire and sit down and prepare yourself to be taken to a different place. A place where fat people get very close to making you laugh and everyone has nice clothes and haircuts and you will you reflect on things for a while. It can also inspire you to think that you could be a writer on a Tyler Perry sitcom because they don't have high barriers to entry when it comes to needing to have actual writing skills. And that's why Tyler Perry is a man of the people, he's not being elitist and superior, he's being lowbrow and common THAT'S THE POINT PEOPLE!So tired of the traditional media judging us.Tyler Perry is America's version of Belgian TV producer Melange. Melange was famous for giving people what they wanted and cashing big check because of it. If you don't like that, maybe you should do something yourself.
