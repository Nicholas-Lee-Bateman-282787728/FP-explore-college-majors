The reason I don't give it the full five is because 1) I saw no need for the foul language the writers incorporated into the script and to display the mother influencing it on her children.....(this could have been a super-clean family G-rated movie...with a better job of editing and a tighter, cleaner screenplay.  We need more of this in our morally decadent society today.  And 2), at the end.....I wanted to see the inside of the new house!!!  It may be a silly, moot point and maybe it wasn't in the budget to create a set or film inside a new house with mom and the kids in awestricken wonder....thanking God for the blessings he gave to them after all they went through.Nevertheless, it is still great film fare with great performances by everyone....(the kids in the cast tug at your heartstrings...especially the fine performance by Edward Furlong as Shayne.Kathy Bates, as always, is right on target and the chemistry between her and the kids is great!The DVD has no english subtitles, only French and Spanish which is unfortunate for the hearing impaired.  Also included is the theatrical trailer.

574785,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000059TGA,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","A Home of Our Own is a nice simple story about a mother and her six children who decide to leave Los Angeles one day, and start over in the mountain regions of Idaho where they meet a friendly guy and eventually build up their dream home.Once again, Kathy Bates rocks the house down (and yes, I *have* been watching Harry's Law, haha).  Her performance in this film leaves me completely speechless and begging for more.  Has she ever starred in a BAD movie?  I don't think so!  Or rather, has she ever put on a disappointing performance?She plays the role of an intelligent woman struggling to raise her family, and throughout the film we find out more and more about the husband/father and why he's not around.As far as the kids are concerned, well truth be told, featuring six kids *is* quite a lot, but it works because the only one that really receives any kind of attention and actual plot development is the oldest son.He learns about the hardships of growing up back in the early 60's and starting over in a new school, having girlfriends, raising his younger brothers and sisters, etc.  The only aspect that wasn't really focused on was his ability to develop friends- apparently he had none.Overall, there's nothing particularly revolutionary about A Home of Our Own.  It's just a simple, easy to follow story about a family trying their best to get by through difficult times.  In that regard, several people can relate to it, which makes it strike pretty close to home for many of us.  In fact, a good comparison would be A Christmas Story, but with less humor and more drama.Actually A Christmas Story was pretty darn funny, wasn't it?  Yeah, a Home of Our Own centers more around drama, which is evident as soon as the Christmas segment comes around.

574798,AA3X67I602EAE,B000059TGA,litgirl,"[0, 0]","We have had off-and-on difficult financial times in my family since I can ever remember, some worse than others.  Raising a child, in these past few years, increasingly shows diminishing expectations for continuing what they once (and we once) took for granted.  Specifically: in our county, some towns have around 70% of their children on free lunch or lunch assistance programs.  We are hard hit as a community by mill closures and other huge blows that come along with that.  This film has been a perspective-inducer that has helped a very good but fairly oblivious tween realize that neither is having less an unusual thing, but it could be much much worse--that family is a group effort and a comfort when appreciated and worked at.  The perspective of the parent is classic but full of strength as a widow with so many children must make the impossible happen.  What is new is the perception of the children doing all they can to give back, help out, earn for, and build their lives (and home) together.  Sometimes their little efforts aren't much..or even lead to disaster, but they are REAL.  The expectations on the two eldest chidren (one a teen who feels not only typically ""teen-ish"" but mostly has to take on the responsibilities of a full-grown man) are a source of real-world situations and language.  The widow's grief expresses itself as anger at her undeserving deceased husband and is psychologically realistic (one of the ""stages of grief"").  She does have a phrase which is expressed in an imperfect way...something her children shouldn't exactly hear...but again this is not for young children.  The children recognize it more as an endearment and cry for help from a single mother than as a slam on themselves or their father.  It becomes more of a rant...and oddly a bonding phrase (!!)......BUT: the children do know and continue to learn that the father always treated the mother like a queen...that he is sincerely missed and needed.  Unlike what some have said here, it is NOT a typical feminist manifesto film--as if believing women are equal to men is a bad thing.  It is a film with psychologically realistic layering--losing a parent and husband and all financial security IS a point of real suffering...and there is not a moment where the father is seen as a true fiend or loser.  Removing a wedding ring to sell it with tears in her eyes, the widow rolls off her rant...but it is a way to cope...not a slam at her husband.As far as the complications of the film for children goes:  This level of maturity involves ""gray area thinking"" rather than a black and white understanding of life.  If your child can't comprehend life's gray areas yet, then it is not the right time to see the film together.  Parental presence and interpretation would be a must for tweens.Yes, this is not a G movie...but it is a GOOD movie.  By the way: ""G"" means General Audiences and does not always mean ""Good for Children"" or just plain ""Good.""The most inspiring scene for me (remembering my own life as the eldest child of a struggling single mother and now as a parent myself) was when the mother relates her recurring bad dream: that she's pushing their giant clunker of a car up a hill and all of the children are looking at her through the rear window; that in the dream she is just so tired and pushing and pushing, seeming to go nowhere, afraid of giving out and letting it all roll down.  Her oldest daughter reminds her of a thing novel to most family films: the kids aren't IN the car.  They're outside pushing with her.  How true.A comparison to this story would be ""This Boy's Life"" (a great film made in the 90's and taken from a perfect memoire by the same title)...starring De Niro, Di Caprio, etc.  A very similar set of circumstances...but this is lighter fare with a more redeeming outcome and much much more inspiration: all because of a strong mom's ethical and moral compass, strong backbone...and enduring love.Compared to many films with a sense of purpose: lessons are aplenty but the narrative is strong rather than blandly tedious or didactic.  While ""family"" is sometimes a huge struggle, it is sometimes all you have and essentially one of the few things that matter.  Having pride in oneself and one's own power does not mean you can't have times of humility where others can step in to help: none of us are an island.  While being poor is pretty damn bad, being a poor person does not make you worth less.Some have said this is from a true story and I'm hoping to find it, as I did This Boy's Life.",5,So thankful for this film,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,4542,"['have', 'had', 'off-and-on', 'difficult', 'financial', 'times', 'family', 'can', 'ever', 'remember', 'worse', 'others', 'Raising', 'child', 'few', 'years', 'increasingly', 'diminishing', 'expectations', 'continuing', 'what', 'once', 'once', 'took', 'granted', 'Specifically', 'county', 'towns', 'have', 'around', '70', '%', 'children', 'free', 'lunch', 'lunch', 'assistance', 'programs', 'are', 'hard', 'hit', 'community', 'mill', 'closures', 'other', 'huge', 'blows', 'come', 'film', 'been', 'perspective-inducer', 'helped', 'very', 'good', 'fairly', 'oblivious', 'tween', 'realize', 'having', 'less', 'unusual', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'family', 'group', 'effort', 'comfort', 'when', 'appreciated', 'worked', 'perspective', 'parent', 'classic', 'full', 'strength', 'widow', 'so', 'many', 'children', 'must', 'make', 'impossible', 'happen', 'What', 'new', 'perception', 'children', 'doing', 'can', 'give', 'back', 'help', 'out', 'earn', 'build', 'lives', 'home', 'together', 'Sometimes', 'little', 'efforts', 'are', ""n't"", 'much..or', 'even', 'lead', 'disaster', 'are', 'REAL', 'expectations', 'two', 'eldest', 'chidren', 'one', 'teen', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'typically', 'teen-ish', 'mostly', 'take', 'responsibilities', 'full-grown', 'man', 'are', 'source', 'real-world', 'situations', 'language', 'widow', 'grief', 'anger', 'undeserving', 'deceased', 'husband', 'psychologically', 'realistic', 'one', 'stages', 'grief', 'have', 'phrase', 'expressed', 'imperfect', 'way', 'something', 'children', 'should', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'hear', 'again', 'not', 'young', 'children', 'children', 'recognize', 'more', 'endearment', 'cry', 'help', 'single', 'mother', 'slam', 'father', 'more', 'rant', 'oddly', 'bonding', 'phrase', 'BUT', 'children', 'do', 'know', 'continue', 'learn', 'father', 'always', 'treated', 'mother', 'queen', 'sincerely', 'missed', 'needed', 'what', 'have', 'said', 'here', 'NOT', 'typical', 'feminist', 'manifesto', 'film', 'believing', 'women', 'are', 'equal', 'men', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'psychologically', 'realistic', 'layering', 'losing', 'parent', 'husband', 'financial', 'security', 'point', 'real', 'suffering', 'not', 'moment', 'where', 'father', 'seen', 'true', 'fiend', 'loser', 'Removing', 'wedding', 'ring', 'sell', 'tears', 'eyes', 'widow', 'rant', 'way', 'cope', 'not', 'slam', 'husband.As', 'far', 'complications', 'film', 'children', 'level', 'maturity', 'gray', 'area', 'thinking', 'rather', 'black', 'white', 'understanding', 'life', 'child', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'life', 'gray', 'areas', 'yet', 'then', 'not', 'right', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'together', 'Parental', 'presence', 'interpretation', 'would', 'be', 'must', 'tweens.Yes', 'not', 'G', 'movie', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'way', 'G', 'General', 'Audiences', 'not', 'always', 'mean', 'Good', 'Children', 'just', 'plain', 'Good', 'most', 'inspiring', 'scene', 'remembering', 'own', 'life', 'eldest', 'child', 'struggling', 'single', 'mother', 'now', 'parent', 'was', 'when', 'mother', 'recurring', 'bad', 'dream', 'pushing', 'giant', 'clunker', 'car', 'up', 'hill', 'children', 'are', 'looking', 'rear', 'window', 'dream', 'just', 'so', 'tired', 'pushing', 'pushing', 'seeming', 'go', 'nowhere', 'afraid', 'giving', 'out', 'letting', 'roll', 'down', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'thing', 'novel', 'most', 'family', 'films', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'IN', 'car', ""'re"", 'outside', 'pushing', 'How', 'true.A', 'comparison', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'Boy', 'Life', 'great', 'film', 'made', '90', 'taken', 'perfect', 'memoire', 'same', 'title', 'starring', 'De', 'Niro', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'etc', 'very', 'similar', 'set', 'circumstances', 'lighter', 'fare', 'more', 'redeeming', 'outcome', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'inspiration', 'strong', 'mom', 'ethical', 'moral', 'compass', 'strong', 'backbone', 'enduring', 'love.Compared', 'many', 'films', 'sense', 'purpose', 'lessons', 'are', 'aplenty', 'narrative', 'strong', 'rather', 'blandly', 'tedious', 'didactic', 'family', 'sometimes', 'huge', 'struggle', 'sometimes', 'all', 'have', 'essentially', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'matter', 'Having', 'pride', 'oneself', 'one', 'own', 'power', 'not', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'times', 'humility', 'where', 'others', 'can', 'step', 'help', 'none', 'are', 'island', 'being', 'poor', 'pretty', 'damn', 'bad', 'being', 'poor', 'person', 'not', 'make', 'worth', 'less.Some', 'have', 'said', 'true', 'story', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'find', 'did', 'Boy', 'Life']",N/A

Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer""","[14, 16]","""The less you have, the more it hurts when you lose it.""In this independent film Frances Lacey is a widow trying to survive in the man's world of the 1960s. With three boys and three girls, ranging in age from four to fifteen, her task is even harder. Shayne, the eldest, has become the man of the house, albeit begrudgingly. When he talks out of turn he dutifully gets his father's belt and takes his punishment while Lynn, Faye, Murray, Annie and Craig look on.Frances is a strong persuasive woman who stands up for herself and her children. After being fired from a Los Angeles potato chip factory for standing up to sexual harassment Frances decides, without discussion, to find something better. She sells whatever she can and packs everything else, along with the kids, into their rusty old Plymouth and starts driving.They end up in rural Idaho sitting in the car outside a dilapidated half built frame house. It's love at first sight for Frances. In exchange for what Frances calls slave labour she makes an exchange with the owner and neighbour, Mr. Moon, for the property and house. He agrees hesitantly and totally unaware of the changes that are going to occur in his life.For a regular income she talks the local bowling alley owner into hiring her even though she has no experience. She's willing to work and willing to learn. She passes her good work ethics onto her children who also work to earn money to help finish the house. Their only real home since their father died.A Home of Our Own is an adult film with adult content and narrated by Shayne who looks back to when he was 15 years old. He calls his mother ""one of a kind"" and she certainly is. Kathy Bates, not surprisingly gives an excellent performance of a distraught woman looking to provide a secure home for her offspring. She doesn't claim to be a perfect woman and she quickly learns from her mistakes but it isn't until a tragedy occurs that she learns she can't control everything, the value of community and that it's ok to ask for help. Edward Furlong plays Shayne and is believable as the loyal son wanting to be the man of the house but torn with the fact he's still a child.The narrator is director Tony Bill (thank you Tamilisa Wood) who really gives a Wonder Years feel to the film. I highly recommend watching this character driven film. Reviewed by M. E.

She sells what little they have and piles everyone in the car and just drives - destination unknown.

She barters labor in trade for payments - every kid does chores for the neighbor they bought the house from, she gets a low paying job at the bowling alley (where the customers tip her in tools and stuff for building her home), and the oldest kid (maybe 14?) works his butt off before and after school for minimum wage to help support the family.  Then the 2nd oldest boy (maybe 10) talks himself into working in trade at the scrap yard and brings home his ""treasures"" (like a toilet) to help build the house.They do an awful lot of ""doing without"" and being made fun of by the kids at school (and even teachers), and so the story goes...When things finally get a TINY bit better, more hard luck follows... the whole movie is like that.
