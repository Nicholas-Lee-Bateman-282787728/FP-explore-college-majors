1298148,A11PRT1CCVHB52,B002XTBE5Q,"B. Daniel ""ComicBOOK Lover""","[8, 17]","James McTeigue's ""Ninja Assassin,"" the Wachowski Brothers, Hollywood backed big budget Ninja flick was a ridiculously over the top, and stylish take more on the mythology of ninjas and the supposed mystical abilities they had than it was about those behind the dark mask and shadows. It was violent, bloody, and just plain awesome. After watching Ninjas in anime and videogames melt into shadows and perform ninjutsu (ninja magic) or whatever it's referred to in said media, it was great to see it brought to life here in America. Previously all we had was ""Shinobi: Heart Under Blade,"" which is a great movie and should definitely be checked out. ""Assassin"" is visceral and just plain fun.That said I was also looking forward to the lesser known and much smaller budgeted ""Ninja"" starring Scott Adkins and directed by Isaac Florentine. Both are mostly unknown to the world but both have been around for a bit using their martial arts backgrounds to get some decent direct-to-disc action films out. Adkins a amazing martial artist in his own right, hails from Britain and has most recently been seen as the fight and stunt double for Weapon XI in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" and will appear reprising his role Uri Boyka in ""Undisputed 3."" Florentine is an Israeli born director who has directed martial artists Michael Jai White, and Jean Claude Van Damme in his films that include ""Undisputed 2,"" and ""The Sheppard: Border Patrol,"" respectively.That opening was to illustrate the major difference between ""Ninja"" and ""Assassin."" While ""Assassin"" eschews its 80's roots for a modern yet mythical angle, ""Ninja"" stays firmly entrenched in its 80's roots. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. First let's start with the good. Scott Adkins is underrated as a martial artist, as is his co-star from ""Undisputed 2,"" Michael Jai White. In ""Ninja"" Adkins plays the role of Casey Bowman, an American raised at a Japanese dojo run by the last surviving descendant of the Koga Ninja Clan. The story is simple and to the point. Sometimes to the detriment of the film, but again, it's a throwback and I think Florentine consciously made it such. After the other top student at the school is expelled, he returns sometime later to stake his claim as the next Soke (teacher/leader) of the school and protector of the Yoroi Bitsu, the last remaining artifacts of the Koga Clan. The chest is sent to New York to keep it from Masazuka, who kills his former teacher trying to get to it.What works for the film is its minimalistic approach to the work. Much like ""American Ninja"" before it, this story gives us an American (British) protagonist who grew up studying the ways of the ninja. Much like those films before this, Casey isn't wearing a Ninja suit for most of the film and much of his adventure takes place during the day and he's fighting gangsters and thugs. This film does a great job of showing off Adkins' skills. There are two fight scenes in particular that are top notch, and the editing and multiple angles really sell his moves. There are scenes where he starts a fight and the camera is facing him as he dispatches his adversaries, but as he spins to kick an attacker approaching from behind another camera catches the action from the new angle just before he connects. This isn't the film, cut, edit technique that most films use to make their star look more adept than they are. This was simply placing multiple cameras so that you can catch the action from as many angles that would allow you to make a fluid fight scene. No behind the back, cut to close ups here. Masazuka has an incredible, but all too short standoff in the rain early in the film that has some cool camera work too. It zooms in and out kinetically and allows you to get right up on the action and zooms out just in time to see the broader picture.I mentioned before ""ninja"" was a more realistic look at the ninja, albeit realistic in a ""no shadow melting"" way. One thing I really liked was Masazuka's gear (seen on the cover of the DVD) which is basically modern ninja gear, including night vision visor, grapnel gun, and fire arms. Yes I said fire-arms. I didn't much care for it (if you're a ninja shouldn't the guns at least be silenced) but hey it works for the character as he really has no honor. Of course this sets up the traditional versus the modern fight at the end but hey it was still very cool to see. Though ""Ninja"" may be 80's inspired it did make some improvements to what in emulated. The day scenes were pretty sparse and short and not much action happened during them and was mostly indoors. They actually had night scenes, though they were brightly lit. And the choreography was greatOn the other side of things, the low budget diminished the scope of the film and really limited what could be done. The sets were obviously backlots, and being from NYC I could tell during the rooftop scenes that they had no idea where in the city they wanted this to take place, despite their labeling each place at the beginning of scenes. It seems like the whole film took place within a ten block radius. The chase scene in the middle of the movie starts in the exact same spot the climax of the movie happens. The dialogue was rather bad, and all supporting characters were cardboard.The female lead is also a student at the ninja school, and even bested Casey with a staff during practices, and yet she gets tossed around like a ragdoll. I mean yeah she gets a punch in here, and a kick in there, and is just dangerous wielding a crutch, but seriously she's just a damsel in distress. It's like she there for Casey to get angry about and whoop some ass. Lastly and most importantly are the plot issues. There are several that just made my head hurt, but the biggest was the introduction of an Illuminati like group, who seemed to have an endless number of hooded thugs to send after Casey. It was like a video game at some parts with these guys just coming out of the woodworks. How do they track this guy? They just always know exactly where to go.Plot aside I wasn't going into this looking for Oscar worthy performances and big budget awe. I went into this looking for something to take me back to the world of the Ninja just like when I was a kid. And I was not disappointed. Scott Adkins carries the torch that Michael Dudikof lit many years ago, and he carries it well. I'm hoping Hollywood notices this guy, as he'd be great for ""Iron Fist"" or the character of Roper in that ""Enter The Dragon"" remake I keep hearing about. So as long as you're just looking for some decent martial arts wrapped in a cheesy but yummy 80's candy shell ""Ninja"" is for you.",4,Scott Adkins=Ninja,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,6650,"['James',

1298152,A2Z4B0VALQL9CC,B002XTBE5Q,Cheese Steak Jimmy,"[8, 8]","There has been a modest revival in Ninja films in the last year, with Ninja Assassin [DVD] [2009] triggering an inevitable wave of DTV low-budget entries into the somewhat anaemic Ninja action movie sub-genre. Ninja follows hot on the heels of the Casper ""I was in Starship Troopers once"" Van Dien vehicle, Mask of the Ninja- a movie that has almost nothing going for it. Mask of the Ninja stumbles and splutters between poorly executed fight scenes, as Van Dien and his co-stars embarrassedly mumble their way through atrocious dialogue; add to the mix awful Seven [DVD] -style editing and poor lighting, and you have a film that isn't worth two hours of your life.Ninja is a much better film. While not quite harking back to the Ninja genre's giddy, exploitation heights ( for instance Revenge of the Ninja [DVD] [1983]  or American Ninja [DVD] [1985]), the director Isaac Florentine wisely realizes the limitations of his budget, and avoids the temptation of Bourne shaky-cam, while firmly training his camera on star Scott Adkins, who is quite simply phenomenal. Adkins brings a physicality to the role that is reminiscent of Jason Statham in The Transporter/Transporter 2, with the added bonus of being able to do some crazy Tony Jaa-style acrobatics.

1298172,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002XTBE5Q,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","It probably would've been less of a headache for everyone if only the sensei had given his unruly pupil another chance. But the sensei didn't, and so Masazuka, expelled from the dojo, went completely over to the dark side, becoming a ruthless ninja assassin. NINJA stars the ridiculously ripped Scott Adkins and tracks his character's attempts in New York City to safeguard the Yorio Bitsu, the legendary weapons of the last Koga Ninja, from the clutches of Masazuka and his waves of thugs. There's also some nefarious secret sect called the Ring throwing in its two cents, not that the script writers fleshed it out that well. Then again, in a martial arts picture, things like script and plot and acting and internal consistency serve a marginal function.Scott Adkins plays Casey Bowman, an American student of Ninjutsu who as a twelve-year-old orphan was taken in by the martial arts dojo. And as soon as you hear the sensei advise his pupils to ""Listen to Casey,"" you know that the glowering guy over there was steadily getting his hate on. Masazuka (Tsuyoshi Ihara) is highly offended that the sensei chose to heap praise on the gaijin. And, essentially, that's your conflict right there.You've seen variations of this same old plot regurgitated before, and you can even throw in that rivalry between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. Honestly, in this genre, the story sometimes isn't so important (witness the dumb, go-nowhere sub-plot involving Casey's estranged mother). Sometimes it's enough that the story is there to provide a framing device for what we came for: the bonecrunching martial arts. And in this area, the movie delivers. The fight scenes are dynamically staged. And when it comes to the fight presentation, NINJA improves on NINJA ASSASSIN, it's closest contemporary in terms of release date. NINJA's fight scenes have more clarity, maybe because it doesn't make use of shaky cams or tight close-ups that prevent the viewer from seeing the martial arts moves in great detail. The American martial artist sub-genre has come along since the days of AMERICAN NINJA. Scott Adkins is the real deal and demonstrates more legit martial skills than did good old Michael Dudikoff. Adkins exhibits flair and sleek moves, and I'm pretty sure that's him performing the acrobatic stunts. It's said that Adkins was a Jean-Claude Van Damme fan when he was a kid, and it shows. Check out those impressive helicopter kicks. But try not to wince when Adkins finally puts on that tacky ninja outfit.I've always wondered why ninjas were so stubborn that they cling solely to the use of traditional weaponry. This flick fixes that concern and demonstrates that at least this ninja can be forward thinking. Masazuka freely employs hi-tech gear to complement the traditional arsenal, and this makes him even more potent. Tsuyoshi Ihara, who with his shades on looks like an evil Asian Jimmy Smits, is really good and menacing as Adkins' foil. The actress who plays the sensei's daughter (and, incidentally, Adkins' love interest) gets to take out a goon or five. In one scene, she even engages in a demo of subway crutch-fu.NINJA scores high on the violence meter. The ninja assassin's blades cause fountains of blood to jet out of his perforated victims. Body bits get sliced and filleted. There's the occasional beheading or two. Collateral damage is pronounced as tons of innocent bystanders bite a bullet. One particularly awesome kill scene has Adkins hurling a goon out the subway train window only to be pancaked by another oncoming subway train.But what the hell happened to that police helicopter circling above the climactic fight scene? What, did the cops just give up and leave, after everyone ignored their orders for all parties to drop their weapons? That's not very NYPD.

I was hoping it was not all in subtitles. I was lucky and it was not. There were some parts with sub titles. But don't worry. They did not speed by so fast that someone couldn't read them. The movie is about a man who is in a school for martial arts. After his dad died and his mom left him at this school when he was a child, he stayed in the school. Time comes to choose a new head in the school. Another man attending the school is jealous. During a spar he gets a real sword and tries to kill the man. He is banned from ever coming back to the school. Then, he comes back. There is a sword and a special box. The box has items in it that are rare and mean a lot to the people who went to the school. The man who tried to kill the other student wants the box. The young man who was almost killed is sent to protect the box. That's the story. It is cheesy and the acting is just ok. But, the reason that I will be buying this when it is available is the fighting. WOW! This was some of the best and coolest fighting I have ever seen in a movie. I mean scenes that have a man cut someone with a sword and blood just squirts all over the place. Don't worry though, it is not super bloody and meant to make you sick. It almost seems real when you are watching. For an actor I have never heard of, the man sure can fight.

So much to simultaneously revere and revile.  I'll try and keep my comments lean but I could describe factors from either category at great length.  The important thing to remember is that for a DTV release it's got some decent fights and looks pretty slick.  So if one doesn't enter this with high expectations a fun time should be had.A young man named Casey (Scott Adkins, ""El Gringo"") has spent most of his life training in a Ninjutsu dojo after he was orphaned in Japan since adolescence.  His Sensei (Togo Igawa, ""The Last Samurai"") has picked him and fellow student Masazuka (Tsuyoshi Ihara, ""Letters From Iwo Jima"") as his two best pupils and one will be given the title of the Sensei's rightful successor to protect and maintain some ancient Ninja weapons and carry on the school's tradition.  While Masazuka is a born native of Japan and the more advanced student, the Sensei senses anger, pride and ambition in him, whereas Casey is deeply dedicated and possesses the preferred humble demeanor.  During competition for the promotion, Masazuka tries to kill Casey, prompting the Sensei to permanently kick him out of the dojo, adding to Masazuka's painful emotional tapestry with feelings of resentment and abandonment.  Later, when the Sensei learns of Masazuka's new job as an assassin for hire (GREAT dental plan), he sends Casey and his daughter, Namiko (Mika Hijii), to New York City to hide the weapons from Masazuka.As a fan of martial arts films, I had not looked forward to this as a Ninja flick so much as I had another collabortation between director Isaac Florentine and actor Scott Adkins.  Their ""Undisputed 2"" is one of the best DTV martial-arts films I've ever seen.  Luckily for me, I had heard several groans of disappointment from many a member of the fu-community before I finally got my hands on it.  Taking their complaints to heart I ended up enjoying it quite a bit.While still pretty good, the fights could've been WAY better and have some awkward problems.  The biggest being that until the last 20 minutes of the movie, Casey seems inexplicably restrained.  He eventually goes through an entire building of the same goons he can barely handle 2 or 3 of in earlier confrontations.  Also, Namiko, the daughter of the Sensei and a lifelong ninja-practitioner, has great difficulty handling herself in several scuffles.On the plus side, Tsuyoshi Ihara does a fine job as Masazuka in all required ways.  The Ninja sub-genre has never been my favorite (though I've seen plenty) so perhaps I'm not qualified to comment on the actual Ninjutsu but I thought that the scenes of him sneaking around wasting dudes was pretty sweet.  Nice mix of old and new weapons, too.  Mika Hijii as Namiko is sweet and cute and, despite her character's flaws, is a considerable step-up as the feminine 3rd wheel in an action flick.  There are also some interesting little visual nods to films like ""Sin City"" and the anime-favorite ""Ninja Scroll"".The DVD has good widescreen picture quality and no special features.  Oh, well. I have seen this now several times and still like it a lot but to recommend it creates some hesitation.  It avoids some cliches and dives head-first into others and if it still interests you after all of that it's probably for you, assuming you can handle when members of a global-level ""secret"" society wear matching jackets.  3.5/52009",3,Direct-to-video polarity!,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",2012,3486,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'action', 'film', 'long', 'list', 'assets', 'liabilities', 'So', 'much', 'simultaneously', 'revere', 'revile', ""'ll"", 'try', 'keep', 'comments', 'lean', 'could', 'describe', 'factors', 'category', 'great', 'length', 'important', 'thing', 'remember', 'DTV', 'release', 'got', 'decent', 'fights', 'pretty', 'slick', 'So', 'one', ""n't"", 'enter', 'high', 'expectations', 'fun', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'had.A', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Casey', 'Scott', 'Adkins', 'El', 'Gringo', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'training', 'Ninjutsu', 'dojo', 'was', 'orphaned', 'Japan', 'adolescence', 'Sensei', 'Togo', 'Igawa', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'picked', 'fellow', 'student', 'Masazuka', 'Tsuyoshi', 'Ihara', 'Letters', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'two', 'best', 'pupils', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'title', 'Sensei', 'rightful', 'successor', 'protect', 'maintain', 'ancient', 'Ninja', 'weapons', 'carry', 'school', 'tradition', 'Masazuka', 'born', 'native', 'Japan', 'more', 'advanced', 'student', 'Sensei', 'anger', 'pride', 'ambition', 'Casey', 'deeply', 'dedicated', 'preferred', 'humble', 'demeanor', 'competition', 'promotion', 'Masazuka', 'kill', 'Casey', 'prompting', 'Sensei', 'permanently', 'kick', 'dojo', 'adding', 'Masazuka', 'painful', 'emotional', 'tapestry', 'feelings', 'resentment', 'abandonment', 'Later', 'when', 'Sensei', 'learns', 'Masazuka', 'new', 'job', 'assassin', 'hire', 'GREAT', 'dental', 'plan', 'Casey', 'daughter', 'Namiko', 'Mika', 'Hijii', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'hide', 'weapons', 'Masazuka.As', 'fan', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'had', 'not', 'looked', 'forward', 'Ninja', 'flick', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'collabortation', 'director', 'Isaac', 'Florentine', 'actor', 'Scott', 'Adkins', 'Undisputed', '2', 'one', 'best', 'DTV', 'martial-arts', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Luckily', 'had', 'heard', 'several', 'groans', 'disappointment', 'many', 'member', 'fu-community', 'finally', 'got', 'hands', 'Taking', 'complaints', 'heart', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'quite', 'bit.While', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'fights', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'WAY', 'better', 'have', 'awkward', 'problems', 'biggest', 'being', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Casey', 'inexplicably', 'restrained', 'eventually', 'entire', 'building', 'same', 'goons', 'can', 'barely', 'handle', '2', '3', 'earlier', 'confrontations', 'Also', 'Namiko', 'daughter', 'Sensei', 'lifelong', 'ninja-practitioner', 'great', 'difficulty', 'handling', 'several', 'scuffles.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Tsuyoshi', 'Ihara', 'fine', 'job', 'Masazuka', 'required', 'ways', 'Ninja', 'sub-genre', 'never', 'been', 'favorite', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'not', 'qualified', 'comment', 'actual', 'Ninjutsu', 'thought', 'scenes', 'sneaking', 'wasting', 'dudes', 'was', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'Nice', 'mix', 'old', 'new', 'weapons', 'too', 'Mika', 'Hijii', 'Namiko', 'sweet', 'cute', 'character', 'flaws', 'considerable', 'step-up', 'feminine', '3rd', 'wheel', 'action', 'flick', 'are', 'also', 'interesting', 'little', 'visual', 'nods', 'films', 'Sin', 'City', 'anime-favorite', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', '.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'quality', 'special', 'features', 'Oh', 'well', 'have', 'seen', 'now', 'several', 'times', 'still', 'lot', 'recommend', 'hesitation', 'cliches', 'head-first', 'others', 'still', 'interests', 'probably', 'assuming', 'can', 'handle', 'when', 'members', 'global-level', 'secret', 'society', 'matching', 'jackets', '3.5/52009']",N/A

1298191,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B002XTBE5Q,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 3]","I didn't likeNinja Assassin. Call me old-fashioned, but replacing real-life physicality and athleticism with CGI strikes discord in me. To me, ""Ninja Assassin"" was more of a horror movie with ninjas taking the place of monsters, featuring fight scenes that relied more on post-production editing than the talents of the performers on the set. I liked it even less since it's undoubtedly destined to be the leading lights of a comeback of the original 80s ninja fandom - an honor that couldn't have gone to a worse contestant.  I had more faith Isaac Florentine's low-budget production, since he has proven time over that he has both the skills and appreciation for action movies to be the true architect behind a possible revival. Oh, and his movie starred the current king of kung fu, Scott Adkins. Shouldn't this be great? Well, I certainly hoped so, but I'm sorry to have to admit that ""Ninja"" is no award-winner: while it shows up some of the superficialities of ""Assassin"", it fails to define itself as a worthy alternative by falling short in a number of others.The story: Casey (Adkins), a western orphan studying the art of ninja in Japan, is asked by his sensei (Togo Igawa,Memoirs of a Geisha) to deliver the prized treasure of their school to America to keep it safe from the hands of a jealous outcast, Masazuka (Tsuyoshi Ihara,Letters from Iwo Jima), who has honed his skills and recruited members of an American gang-sect for the sole purpose of getting his hands on the prized heirloom.Apparently, ""Ninja"" was created back-to-back with another Adkins vehicle,Undisputed III: Redemption; knowing this and comparing the production values of the two, it's easy to speculate that ""Ninja"" was lower on Florentine's list of priorities. Don't get me wrong, it's good-looking for a DTV production, but it fails to match the standard set by his other big project. Its superficial sleekness is interrupted by the occasional unnecessary post-production 'enhancement' and the fact that it's not backing up any particularly breathtaking action scenes. Again, what's there is better than any old DTV martial arts flick, but fans of Adkins will note that he's been in more exhilarating brawls than these and delivered much cooler moves. The close-quarters fight in the train is neat, as is the randori in the warehouse, but most of the other fights are either too short or one-sided to stand out. It's all better than quick-cuts and computer effects, in my opinion, but come on - was it really impossible to utilize Adkins as well as he has been in the past?As a torchbearer of the ninja subgenre, the movie disappoints for choosing to ape the style of ""Ninja Assassin"" rather than classics likeRevenge of the Ninja. There are some definite clich&eacute;s and cheesiness to remind us of the good ol' Cannon days, but far from paying homage to the golden era of ninja movies, Florentine indulges in excessive CGI bloodletting and ends up making a minor mockery of the ninja archetype via some clueless character spins and occasionally exaggerating physical abilities to a ridiculous lengths (e.g. the disappearing-in-front-of-your-eyes trick was actually done better in ""Ninja Assassin""). The 'modern ninja' aspect was pretty cool - use of night vision, retractable swords, etc. - but I wish it had been exploited a bit more, especially since the final showdown between Casey and Maz is billed as an all-out old school vs. new grudge match but didn't do much to perpetuate the premise.Admittedly, maybe I'm being a bit too hard on the movie; I guess I was just hoping for Florentine to pull off another ""Undisputed"" and show up the multimillion-dollar Hollywood studios again. Alas, ""Ninja"" will fool no one about its DTV roots, for it fails to rise above all the stigmas of low-budget moviemaking. As mentioned, comparisons to the other big ninja movie of our time don't fare well for this one: though there's some definite quality here, it fails to shine as brightly as its super-glossy competitor. Florentine fans ought to remain faithful, but if you're looking for the truly defining shadow warrior flick, look to the past - it can't be replicated in modern times, it seems.",3,Stay In The Shadows,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,4177,"['did', ""n't"", 'likeNinja', 'Assassin', 'Call', 'old-fashioned', 'replacing', 'real-life', 'physicality', 'athleticism', 'CGI', 'strikes', 'discord', 'Ninja', 'Assassin', 'was', 'more', 'horror', 'movie', 'ninjas', 'taking', 'place', 'monsters', 'featuring', 'fight', 'scenes', 'relied', 'more', 'post-production', 'editing', 'talents', 'performers', 'set', 'liked', 'even', 'less', 'undoubtedly', 'destined', 'be', 'leading', 'lights', 'comeback', 'original', '80s', 'ninja', 'fandom', 'honor', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'worse', 'contestant', 'had', 'more', 'faith', 'Isaac', 'Florentine', 'low-budget', 'production', 'proven', 'time', 'skills', 'appreciation', 'action', 'movies', 'be', 'true', 'architect', 'possible', 'revival', 'Oh', 'movie', 'starred', 'current', 'king', 'kung', 'fu', 'Scott', 'Adkins', 'Should', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'Well', 'certainly', 'hoped', 'so', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'admit', 'Ninja', 'award-winner', 'up', 'superficialities', 'Assassin', 'define', 'worthy', 'alternative', 'falling', 'short', 'number', 'others.The', 'story', 'Casey', 'Adkins', 'western', 'orphan', 'studying', 'art', 'ninja', 'Japan', 'asked', 'sensei', 'Togo', 'Igawa', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'deliver', 'prized', 'treasure', 'school', 'America', 'keep', 'safe', 'hands', 'jealous', 'outcast', 'Masazuka', 'Tsuyoshi', 'Ihara', 'Letters', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'who', 'honed', 'skills', 'recruited', 'members', 'American', 'gang-sect', 'sole', 'purpose', 'getting', 'hands', 'prized', 'heirloom.Apparently', 'Ninja', 'was', 'created', 'back-to-back', 'Adkins', 'vehicle', 'Undisputed', 'III', 'Redemption', 'knowing', 'comparing', 'production', 'values', 'two', 'easy', 'speculate', 'Ninja', 'was', 'lower', 'Florentine', 'list', 'priorities', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good-looking', 'DTV', 'production', 'match', 'standard', 'set', 'other', 'big', 'project', 'superficial', 'sleekness', 'interrupted', 'occasional', 'unnecessary', 'post-production', ""'enhancement"", 'fact', 'not', 'backing', 'up', 'particularly', 'breathtaking', 'action', 'scenes', 'Again', 'what', 'better', 'old', 'DTV', 'martial', 'arts', 'flick', 'fans', 'Adkins', 'will', 'note', 'been', 'more', 'exhilarating', 'brawls', 'delivered', 'much', 'cooler', 'moves', 'close-quarters', 'fight', 'train', 'neat', 'randori', 'warehouse', 'most', 'other', 'fights', 'are', 'either', 'too', 'short', 'one-sided', 'stand', 'out', 'better', 'quick-cuts', 'computer', 'effects', 'opinion', 'come', 'was', 'really', 'impossible', 'utilize', 'Adkins', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'past', 'torchbearer', 'ninja', 'subgenre', 'movie', 'disappoints', 'choosing', 'ape', 'style', 'Ninja', 'Assassin', 'rather', 'classics', 'likeRevenge', 'Ninja', 'are', 'definite', 'clich', 'eacute', 'cheesiness', 'remind', 'good', 'ol', 'Cannon', 'days', 'far', 'paying', 'homage', 'golden', 'era', 'ninja', 'movies', 'Florentine', 'excessive', 'CGI', 'bloodletting', 'up', 'making', 'minor', 'mockery', 'ninja', 'archetype', 'clueless', 'character', 'spins', 'occasionally', 'exaggerating', 'physical', 'abilities', 'ridiculous', 'lengths', 'e.g', 'disappearing-in-front-of-your-eyes', 'trick', 'was', 'actually', 'done', 'better', 'Ninja', 'Assassin', ""'modern"", 'ninja', 'aspect', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'use', 'night', 'vision', 'retractable', 'swords', 'etc', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'exploited', 'bit', 'more', 'especially', 'final', 'showdown', 'Casey', 'Maz', 'billed', 'all-out', 'old', 'school', 'vs.', 'new', 'grudge', 'match', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'perpetuate', 'premise.Admittedly', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'movie', 'guess', 'was', 'just', 'hoping', 'Florentine', 'pull', 'off', 'Undisputed', 'show', 'up', 'multimillion-dollar', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'again', 'Alas', 'Ninja', 'will', 'fool', 'one', 'DTV', 'roots', 'rise', 'stigmas', 'low-budget', 'moviemaking', 'mentioned', 'comparisons', 'other', 'big', 'ninja', 'movie', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'fare', 'well', 'one', 'definite', 'quality', 'here', 'shine', 'as', 'brightly', 'super-glossy', 'competitor', 'Florentine', 'fans', 'ought', 'remain', 'faithful', ""'re"", 'looking', 'truly', 'defining', 'shadow', 'warrior', 'flick', 'look', 'past', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'replicated', 'modern', 'times']",N/A

1298216,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B002XTBE5Q,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[3, 3]","Movie - 4.0Here's the plot in haiku:Bad jealous ninjafights American ninjafor number one title.Despite its simplistic plot (aren't all ninja movies?), low-budget production (which actually didn't look too bad in some parts), a direct-to-video debut, and the fact that it's helmed by Issac Florentine (yes, the same Issac Florentine that directed many a Power Rangers episode), I have to admit this is actually one of the better ninja titles I've seen since the U.S. ninja boom of the '80s. The first American Ninja and any Sh' Kosugi film still hold a nostalgic place in my heart for the cool, campy, yet bloody portrayal that are ninja. And let's face it, when we think of ninja here in the States we usually think of the stealthy, shadow-sneaking, cold-blooded assassin, right? Ninja (this film) does a great job bypassing any real attempt of a story, maybe only believable for a video game or one-shot anime movie, and skips right to the focal point of what makes ninjas so cool -- the style. In addition to the weaponry and costuming, I notice this movie really puts an emphasis on the actual martial arts/hand-to-hand combat aspect. Even with the mediocre visual effects, I think the movie especially excels in the fight choreography department and even has some excellent Snyder-esque cinematography as Mr. Somner mentioned in his editorial review. Scott Adkins looks very fluid and natural with all those spin kicks. And I feel I must make special mention to Tsuyoshi Ihara as the villain. His character's intentions are pretty clear cut, but he really does a great job playing one heck of a rival ninja. Another factor I really enjoy is the fact that they actually divided the script between English and Japanese dialogue to obtain a more realistic atmosphere. On the other end of the spectrum, though, it's still a low-budget B-movie, so if you happen to chuckle or laugh out loud at some of the poor acting and script, it's completely understandable. Invariably, this will probably get a lot of comparisons to the also recent Ninja Assassin. I enjoy both, though I'd have to give Assassin a slight edge for the higher production values and slightly more solid acting/writing (which isn't by much, but there have to be standards at some point, high-budget or not).Video - 4.5Brought to you by First Look Studios in 1080p at an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (framed at 2.39), Ninja presents itself remarkably well for a low-budget B-movie. Detail and skin textures are tight from the very opening of the movie. Colors are well-balanced with no traces of weird tint. Black levels, while excellent, are a little underwhelmed by the contrast during the night/dark scenes. However, I actually found it to be an effect of the lighting used on-stage. Normally darkness results in very grainy shots, but thanks to the artificial lighting, many of those scenes looked much clearer instead. In fact, the transfer is so clean that it really brings out some of the cheapness of the CG. But with that said, my only complaint is with the one scene around the beginning where Sensei is in the darkness of the dojo. It's extremely grainy, but fixes itself in about 3 or 4 seconds. Aside from that, all things considered the film looks near-reference.Audio - 5.0Wow, the LFEs are killer. I don't know how such a low-budget film can afford to create such a kick-ass lossless track. Music, gunshots, and dramatic rumbling effects are outstanding on this English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track. Dialogue doesn't even lose volume amidst all the chaotic fight sequences, and I'm confident to say this is one diamond-in-the-rough of a reference disc. Surrounds offer great separation between flying/crashing objects, sword-slashing, and punches/kicks. One funny thing I find they like to accentuate is the sound of cracking knuckles. For whatever reason, they surely don't look like they're flexing hard enough, but it seems to sound cool anyway. Don't let this film's B-movie status fool you. Regardless of monetary and developmental constraints, this is definitely worth showcasing on your home theaters.Overall - 4.5Ninja as a movie completely blew my expectations out of the water. It's cheesy at times, maybe even discombobulating at others, but I find myself oddly enamored by the very nature and presentation of all the ninja elements. With some excellent choreography and cinematography the movie does a very good job killing 87 minutes in style. If you grew up in the '80s watching a good number of those Americanized ninja films, I am willing to bet you'll enjoy this title as well. It's not quite as flashy and stylized as Ninja Assassin, but it's a darn good effort that really outdoes itself with reference audio and near-reference video.

Sh Kosugi and those ninja movies made in the early '80s like ""Enter the Ninja""? Though a low-budget martial arts action ""Ninja"" suffers from incoherent storytelling, stock characters and clich&eacute;d narrative techniques (a secret organization?), the fast-paced movie is not boring with surprisingly decent action stunts including some nice sword fights.The story is about Casey (Scott Adkins), a westerner adopted in the Kouga ninja clan, trying to protect the ""Yoroi Bitsu,"" a box containing the sacred armor that has been handed down from generation to generation. Adkins shows what he can do in the action sequences (and there are many of them), but watching him kicking ordinary thugs on and on is not very thrilling. The repetitious action choreography needs more creative moves.Tsuyoshi Ihara plays Masazuka, a disgraced disciple who craves for the clan's heirloom.  Movie fans outside Japan probably remember him as Colonel Takeichi Nishi or ""Baron Nishi"" in Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jima."" Mika Hijii plays the sensei's daughter Namiko. Several scenes of the film indicate both players have enough skills for action stunts, but sadly they are not allowed to show them here.Like the most low-budget action movies you see on DVD, it is not the silly storyline or cheesy effects that bother us.
