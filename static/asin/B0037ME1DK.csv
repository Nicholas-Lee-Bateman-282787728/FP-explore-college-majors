1329762,AYRPJESM22ERK,B0037ME1DK,Allan MacInnis,"[6, 6]","Different sellers seem to have different ideas about the value of this DVD, but if the only copies on this site are upwards of $20, I would advise poking around a bit before buying; no one who knows how to get good deals online should be paying more than $10 for this, since it's definitely a ""cheapie"" product, and however infrequently it surfaces, I do believe it is currently in manufacture, in no way authentically scarce. It also is very likely not ""official"" - I can't imagine Araki's THE LIVING END is public domain, so it's inclusion here is a bit mysterious (and I would bet that the official DVD release of that, while pricier, is much, much better in quality, tho' I haven't looked at this ""threefer"" version myself).However: since this odd little package is the only way to see CLEARCUT at present on DVD, it's worth shelling out SOME money if you haven't seen it - it's an excellent, very provocative piece of cinema LONG OVERDUE FOR A PROPER RELEASE (is anyone listening?). One significant reason for the need for this to finally come out on DVD or Bluray is that - tho' the other people praising it here don't seem to notice or realize it! - this film is significantly MARRED by a fullframe presentation, which is identical to the old VHS version. Various images are stretched, others cropped and pan & scanned; it's obvious, if you're sensitive to these things, that the film would look very, very different in the original aspect ratio, has been mutilated quite significantly to squeeze it into a fullframe presentation. Since there are images of considerable impact - it's an interestingly-shot film, which makes good use of Canadian outdoor settings and has some rather rich hallucinatory scenes inside the sweatlodge - this is definitely a caveat worth noting.Still, as the Japanese would say, at present, shikata ga nai - it can't be helped. A theatre programmer I know has been unable to even track down the rights holder or a film print (if you know of one, contact me!), so it really is unseeable at present, except via this DVD (or the VHS). By the way, the novel that this is based on, MT Kelly's A DREAM LIKE MINE, went back into print in Canada - you may have to use the Canadian version of Amazon to buy it. It's an excellent read, though it uses mercury in the water near a reserve, rather than clearcutting, as its ecological issue. Much of the film faithfully adapts it, however. Both the film and book are very provocative stuff (see the old VHS reviews of the film for more).",3,"Full frame an issue, plus be wary of the price!",1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,2509,"['Different', 'sellers', 'seem', 'have', 'different', 'ideas', 'value', 'DVD', 'only', 'copies', 'site', 'are', 'upwards', '20', 'would', 'advise', 'poking', 'bit', 'buying', 'one', 'who', 'how', 'get', 'good', 'deals', 'online', 'should', 'be', 'paying', 'more', '10', 'definitely', 'cheapie', 'product', 'however', 'infrequently', 'do', 'believe', 'currently', 'manufacture', 'way', 'authentically', 'scarce', 'also', 'very', 'likely', 'not', 'official', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Araki', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'END', 'public', 'domain', 'inclusion', 'here', 'bit', 'mysterious', 'would', 'bet', 'official', 'DVD', 'release', 'pricier', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'quality', 'tho', 'have', ""n't"", 'looked', 'threefer', 'version', '.However', 'odd', 'little', 'package', 'only', 'way', 'see', 'CLEARCUT', 'present', 'DVD', 'worth', 'shelling', 'out', 'SOME', 'money', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'excellent', 'very', 'provocative', 'piece', 'cinema', 'LONG', 'OVERDUE', 'A', 'PROPER', 'RELEASE', 'anyone', 'listening', 'One', 'significant', 'reason', 'need', 'finally', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'tho', 'other', 'people', 'praising', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'notice', 'realize', 'film', 'significantly', 'MARRED', 'fullframe', 'presentation', 'identical', 'old', 'VHS', 'version', 'Various', 'images', 'are', 'stretched', 'others', 'cropped', 'pan', 'scanned', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'sensitive', 'things', 'film', 'would', 'look', 'very', 'very', 'different', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'been', 'mutilated', 'quite', 'significantly', 'squeeze', 'fullframe', 'presentation', 'are', 'images', 'considerable', 'impact', 'interestingly-shot', 'film', 'good', 'use', 'Canadian', 'outdoor', 'settings', 'rather', 'rich', 'hallucinatory', 'scenes', 'sweatlodge', 'definitely', 'caveat', 'worth', 'noting.Still', 'Japanese', 'would', 'say', 'present', 'shikata', 'ga', 'nai', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'helped', 'theatre', 'programmer', 'know', 'been', 'unable', 'even', 'track', 'down', 'rights', 'holder', 'film', 'print', 'know', 'one', 'contact', 'really', 'unseeable', 'present', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'way', 'novel', 'based', 'MT', 'Kelly', 'A', 'DREAM', 'LIKE', 'MINE', 'went', 'back', 'print', 'Canada', 'may', 'have', 'use', 'Canadian', 'version', 'Amazon', 'buy', 'excellent', 'read', 'mercury', 'water', 'reserve', 'rather', 'clearcutting', 'ecological', 'issue', 'Much', 'film', 'faithfully', 'however', 'film', 'book', 'are', 'very', 'provocative', 'stuff', 'see', 'old', 'VHS', 'reviews', 'film', 'more']",N/A

1329764,A2EYK6YZDMBF3M,B0037ME1DK,"Gael Shellenberger ""tvsgael22""","[1, 2]","When I ordered this (new) for the reasonable price of 6 bucks plus some change, I went into it with the assumption that it wouldn't be the greatest viewing quality, since 3 movies are on one dvd (one side, not both). When I received it, I spot checked it on two different TVs, one a 16X9 digital, and one a 32 inch analog.  On both sets, I was pleasantly surprised at the viewing quality.  I found no problem with it at all, and since I'd seen Clearcut years ago on vhs, I find this dvd to better quality than the old vhs.  The movies appear to have been remastered, but are full screen, which isn't a problem with me.  As far as interactive features, it is bare bones, with only one clicking feature, which is for selecting the movie(s) themselves.  No chapter selections or anything else, but who cares about all that stuff when the picture quality is the important thing.  I have to surmise that the dvd is dual layer, which would be the only way the company could get the three movie on in that kind of quality.  The movies are all in their original rated form, so there are no worries about TV prints or any other edited sources.  This is my first review, after being an Amazon customer for years, so it was important for me to get the word out on this particular item, considering the other review.  As for the movies themselves, Clearcut is a given, excellent film, with great performance by Graham Green.  It has a very good co-star, Ron Lea, who co-starred in the Canadian ""Happy Birthday To Me"", among many other films.  Red Surf is fun to see George Clooney in an early role that looks to be a lively B picture.  The Living End is just plain goofy, but interesting to watch once.  In short: great product, great seller (EkekoStore), and gratitude for being able to obtain a rare, high quality dvd.",5,Pleasant Surprise,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,1808,"['When', 'ordered', 'new', 'reasonable', 'price', '6', 'bucks', 'change', 'went', 'assumption', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'greatest', 'viewing', 'quality', '3', 'movies', 'are', 'one', 'dvd', 'one', 'side', 'not', 'When', 'received', 'spot', 'checked', 'two', 'different', 'TVs', 'one', '16X9', 'digital', 'one', '32', 'inch', 'analog', 'sets', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'viewing', 'quality', 'found', 'problem', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Clearcut', 'years', 'ago', 'vhs', 'find', 'dvd', 'better', 'quality', 'old', 'vhs', 'movies', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'are', 'full', 'screen', ""n't"", 'problem', 'As', 'far', 'interactive', 'features', 'bare', 'bones', 'only', 'one', 'clicking', 'feature', 'selecting', 'movie', 's', 'chapter', 'selections', 'anything', 'else', 'who', 'stuff', 'when', 'picture', 'quality', 'important', 'thing', 'have', 'surmise', 'dvd', 'dual', 'layer', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'company', 'could', 'get', 'three', 'movie', 'kind', 'quality', 'movies', 'are', 'original', 'rated', 'form', 'are', 'worries', 'TV', 'prints', 'other', 'edited', 'sources', 'first', 'review', 'being', 'Amazon', 'customer', 'years', 'was', 'important', 'get', 'word', 'out', 'particular', 'item', 'considering', 'other', 'review', 'movies', 'Clearcut', 'given', 'excellent', 'film', 'great', 'performance', 'Graham', 'Green', 'very', 'good', 'co-star', 'Ron', 'Lea', 'who', 'co-starred', 'Canadian', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Me', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Red', 'Surf', 'fun', 'see', 'George', 'Clooney', 'early', 'role', 'be', 'lively', 'B', 'picture', 'Living', 'End', 'just', 'plain', 'goofy', 'interesting', 'watch', 'once', 'short', 'great', 'product', 'great', 'seller', 'EkekoStore', 'gratitude', 'being', 'able', 'obtain', 'rare', 'high', 'quality', 'dvd']",N/A
