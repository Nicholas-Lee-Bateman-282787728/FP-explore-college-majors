They are always a very stark look at life in late 19th century or early 20th century England.  This is one of the darker stories.  None of Cookson's stories have what could be considered ""happy"" endings.  They often have satisfying endings that are a relief after all of the hard scrabble during the story.  But this one is more ambiguous.  The story is well told and the acting is pretty good.  It does seem a little disjointed at times because the story takes leaps in time that could be confusing if you're not paying attention.",4,Good,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,665,"['been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'adaptations', 'tv', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'always', 'very', 'stark', 'look', 'life', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'England', 'one', 'darker', 'stories', 'None', 'Cookson', 'stories', 'have', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'happy', 'endings', 'often', 'have', 'satisfying', 'endings', 'are', 'relief', 'hard', 'scrabble', 'story', 'one', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'seem', 'little', 'disjointed', 'times', 'story', 'leaps', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'confusing', ""'re"", 'not', 'paying', 'attention']",N/A
23773,A3PTOYW3XDY0ID,0773345000,feedthecat,"[1, 1]","This 1991 movie based on Catherine Cookson's novel of the same name turned out to be a pretty good film (as opposed to an ""adaptation""), but could have been better.  I won't go into the plot becuz others have already done so, but the film skips forward in time pretty quickly from scene to scene, making it seem as if many intervening segments had been edited out.  Also, it should have been made more obvious - even with just, say, passing comments by other characters - just HOW big of a crush Bridget Mordaunt had on Joe Skinner (and for how long) and HOW infatuated Victoria was with Lionel Filmore and HOW delicate her character was (prior to their marriage) becuz, then, Bridget's decisions to act the way that she did in regard to her blacking factory manager and her cousin, respectively, would have made more sense to viewers who had NOT read the Brit author's 1989 book (indeed, some viewers might even wonder why the movie HAS been titled THE BLACK CANDLE).As an ""adaptation"", this production was also a bit wanting, though that was largely the result of the almost 600 page novel being condensed into a 103 minute movie.  Obviously, something had to go and, like the 1939 Laurence Olivier/Merle Oberon version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS, what was left out in this version of THE BLACK CANDLE was the story of the second generation.  Since that could have been expected given the respective lengths of the novel and the adaptation, I have no qualms in noting here that this movie ends while Joseph Skinner and Henrietta are still babies.  However, there were other changes that also may not make readers of Cookson's novel happy, which I will now note.** SPOILER ALERT **Among other questionable choices on the part of the producer, director, &/or screenwriter: Joe never asks Bridget to clear his name (okay, this isn't a ""biggee"" since she never managed to do so in the book); Bridget and Lionel are very amicable during the ball to celebrate his engagement to Victoria and she even allows him to lead her to a seat (whereas, in the novel, she tries to like him for Victoria's sake at first, but still views him as a layabout and a cad); Lionel's killing of Fred Skinner is much more deliberate and it is more brutal than in the book (indeed, Lionel even tries to stab Douglas with the knife at one point in this film); and William Filmore's reason for killing his son is diff from the novel, and it takes place when when Lionel's daughter is still an infant.Furthermore, I, myself, wasn't too crazy about the casting of Denholm Elliot as William becuz the senior Filmore is depicted in the book as a big, heavily-jowled, pot-bellied, imposing, demanding, patriarchal chauvanist whereas Elliot plays him as an effete, wimpy lush.  And, while Samantha Bond did a competent job as Bridget, I would have thought that Tara Fitzgerald was made for that role;  instead, she's asked to play the dim, vapid cousin.  Also, the actress cast as ""Daisy"" appears to be at least 30 years older than Nathaniel Parker's ""Lionel"" (the age gap was just 10 years in the novel), which was a consequence of compressing the storyline due to the movie's relatively short length - still, having the age disparity so great makes the elder Filmore son appear to be more mercenary than in the book, in which he's portrayed as actually having sincere feelings for her.In addition, I can't articulate why, but, for some reason, this movie seems as if it were made in the 1970s or '80s.  Perhaps, it was the cinematography or that the film appears quite ""grainy"" for a 1991 film (see below).** SPOILER ALERT FINIS **Still, the acting, screenplay (at least in regard to the dialogue), sets, locations, costumes, etc were good and, all in all, THE BLACK CANDLE is a pretty good movie AND adaptation, and Cookson fans and those interested in period pieces (this story takes place in the latter part of the 19th century in England) may especially enjoy it, but I couldn't help feeling that it could have been better.  Of course,  to be fair, I should, perhaps, note that part of my disappointment is due to the fact that I went to the trouble of re-reading the close to SIX HUNDRED PAGE novel (!) in anticipation of watching this adaptation.Then again, it WAS nice to see Tara Fitzgerald and Nathaniel Parker before they made it big (and, to be frank, it was the picture of those two on the cover of this dvd's case that made me first think of buying this product even though, while good, THE BLACK CANDLE is certainly not my fav Cookson offering).rating:as a movie:  4 starsas a 103 min. adaptation of the novel:  3 1/2 starsdvd: 3 stars (the picture is grainy in many scenes and, in a couple of brief sequences, the film master was marred with black spots and ""scratches"" - and there are no extras on this dvd, but there are subtitles)",4,"not a bad adaptation or film, but could have been better",1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,4810,"['1991', 'movie', 'based', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'novel', 'same', 'name',

23774,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0773345000,Lawyeraau,"[73, 79]","Based upon Catherine Cookson's best-selling novel of the same name, this is a handsome adaptation that beautifully showcases the book. At the  center of the film is a strong, independent woman, modern for her time, England in the nineteenth century.Bridget Mordaunt is a wealthy young woman with a mind of her own and a heart of gold. Intelligent, practical, and fair, she is a no nonsense business woman who has a soft spot for Joe Skinner, a working class, honorable, young man who has broken away from his lazy, trashy family.  He works in the factory that Bridget inherited from her deceased father who taught her the business.  Unfortunately, Joe Skinner is in love with another young woman, Lilly, a factory worker who has been wronged by Lionel Filmore, the profligate scion of an impoverished member of the gentry. Joe marries Lilly, vowing always to protect her good name and knowing that the child she carries is not his.Bridget's cousin, Victoria, who lives with her and whom she supports, is in love with Lionel, who mistakenly believes Victoria to be the factory heiress. On the day that Victoria expects their engagement to be announced, Lionel discovers that Bridget, and not Victoria, is the heiress. As this threatens to destroy the future that Victoria is seeing with rose colored glasses, Bridget steps in and makes a business deal with Lionel, not knowing just how despicable a blackguard Lionel really is, thinking that by doing do she is ensuring Victoria's happiness.When the disparate worlds of the Skinners and Filmores collide one day, it leaves Joe accused of a murder he did not commit. What happens, as a result, will change the lives of all involved, as that murder acts as a catalyst for a series of events and revelations that will leave none concerned unscathed. No matter what happens, however, Bridget is at the core of this film.This is a film worth seeing if one is interested in period pieces, the novels of Catherine Cookson, or a simply entertaining film with a first rate cast.",5,OH...WHAT A WEB WE WEAVE...,1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,2018,"['Based', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'handsome', 'adaptation', 'beautifully', 'book', 'center', 'film', 'strong', 'independent', 'woman', 'modern', 'time', 'England', 'nineteenth', 'century.Bridget', 'Mordaunt', 'wealthy', 'young', 'woman', 'mind', 'own', 'heart', 'gold', 'Intelligent', 'practical', 'fair', 'nonsense', 'business', 'woman', 'who', 'soft', 'spot', 'Joe', 'Skinner', 'working', 'class', 'honorable', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'broken', 'away', 'lazy', 'trashy', 'family', 'factory', 'Bridget', 'inherited', 'deceased', 'father', 'who', 'taught', 'business', 'Unfortunately', 'Joe', 'Skinner', 'love', 'young', 'woman', 'Lilly', 'factory', 'worker', 'who', 'been', 'wronged', 'Lionel', 'Filmore', 'profligate', 'scion', 'impoverished', 'member', 'gentry', 'Joe', 'marries', 'Lilly', 'vowing', 'always', 'protect', 'good', 'name', 'knowing', 'child', 'not', 'his.Bridget', 'cousin', 'Victoria', 'who', 'whom', 'love', 'Lionel', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'Victoria', 'be', 'factory', 'heiress', 'day', 'Victoria', 'engagement', 'be', 'announced', 'Lionel', 'Bridget', 'not', 'Victoria', 'heiress', 'destroy', 'future', 'Victoria', 'seeing', 'rose', 'colored', 'glasses', 'Bridget', 'business', 'deal', 'Lionel', 'not', 'knowing', 'just', 'how', 'despicable', 'blackguard', 'Lionel', 'really', 'thinking', 'doing', 'do', 'ensuring', 'Victoria', 'happiness.When', 'disparate', 'worlds', 'Skinners', 'Filmores', 'collide', 'one', 'day', 'Joe', 'accused', 'murder', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'What', 'result', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'involved', 'murder', 'catalyst', 'series', 'events', 'revelations', 'will', 'leave', 'none', 'concerned', 'unscathed', 'matter', 'what', 'however', 'Bridget', 'core', 'film.This', 'film', 'seeing', 'one', 'interested', 'period', 'pieces', 'novels', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'simply', 'entertaining', 'film', 'first', 'rate', 'cast']",N/A
