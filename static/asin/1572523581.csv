187286,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1572523581,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","One of my favorite movies ever (and I mean EVER), `Mitt Liv som Hund' is an astonishing (and delightful) look at adolescence.  It runs to gamut with it's use of nearly every emotion in the book, depicting the harsher more raw realities of childhood as well as the soft and sweet fantastical moments that only a child (and those young at heart) can truly enjoy.I almost hate to really review this film, because there is so much to draw from and really relish in that it is almost advisable to walk in blind and just soak it all up as it is thrown at you.  Anticipation at times can kill the beauty in the surprise, and this film is such a beautiful surprise indeed.So, the gist of `Mitt Liv som Hund' is that young Ingemar is not thriving at home, or that is to say that home is not thriving due to some dramatic circumstances (his mother's dwindling health) and so Ingemar and his brother are separated and sent to live with relatives.  Ingemar is sent to Sweden to live with his Aunt and Uncle.  They are whimsical and joyous (especially his Uncle) and, while change is always difficult, Ingemar finds a sort of solace in his new home.Seriously, can I stop here?The film is such a splendid amalgam of romance and tension, of blossoming friendships and childish naivety and curiosities and companionship and the need for guidance and discipline.  It is such a fully realized film that beautifully portrays the best and worst (so the entirety) of life.The guy who said that this was uneven missed the point, for life is uneven, thus `Mitt Liv som Hund' is as `even' as they come.The performances that run through this gorgeous film are all outstanding, but singling out one is very, very easy.  Anton Glanzelius is, in a word, astonishing here.  His comprehension of Ingemar's life and struggles is just breathtaking.  1987 was a fantastic year for child performances, from this stunner to Christian Bale's eye-opening performance in `Empire of the Sun' to the one-two-punch of Gaspard Manesse and Raphael Fejto, who just blew through `Au Revoir, les Enfants' with fervor and grace.  Glanzelius is a worthy inclusion to their company (Bale, Glanzelius and Manesse would make my personal Best Actor ballot without ANY hesitation).  Tomas von Bromssen is also a standout, for it is his jovial portrayal of Gunnar, Ingemar's Uncle and newfound guardian, that makes some of the films most poignant scenes POP.  I also want to call attention to the beautiful performance given by Melinda Kinnaman, for her sweet and spunky portrayal of Saga, the tomboy vying for Ingemar's affections, is one of the most memorable and lovable in the film.UGH, I love this movie!",5,A beautifully developed depiction of life at its fullest...,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,2655,"['One', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'mean', 'EVER', 'Mitt', 'Liv', 'som', 'Hund', 'astonishing', 'delightful', 'look', 'adolescence', 'gamut', 'use', 'nearly', 'emotion', 'book', 'depicting', 'harsher', 'more', 'raw', 'realities', 'childhood', 'as', 'well', 'soft', 'sweet', 'fantastical', 'moments', 'only', 'child', 'young', 'heart', 'can', 'truly', 'enjoy.I', 'almost', 'hate', 'really', 'review', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'draw', 'really', 'relish', 'almost', 'advisable', 'walk', 'blind', 'just', 'soak', 'up', 'thrown', 'Anticipation', 'times', 'can', 'kill', 'beauty', 'surprise', 'film', 'beautiful', 'surprise', 'indeed.So', 'gist', 'Mitt', 'Liv', 'som', 'Hund', 'young', 'Ingemar', 'not', 'thriving', 'home', 'say', 'home', 'not', 'thriving', 'due', 'dramatic', 'circumstances', 'mother', 'dwindling', 'health', 'so', 'Ingemar', 'brother', 'are', 'separated', 'sent', 'live', 'relatives', 'Ingemar', 'sent', 'Sweden', 'live', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'are', 'whimsical', 'joyous', 'especially', 'Uncle', 'change', 'always', 'difficult', 'Ingemar', 'sort', 'solace', 'new', 'home.Seriously', 'can', 'stop', 'here', 'film', 'splendid', 'amalgam', 'romance', 'tension', 'blossoming', 'friendships', 'childish', 'naivety', 'curiosities', 'companionship', 'need', 'guidance', 'discipline', 'such', 'fully', 'realized', 'film', 'beautifully', 'best', 'worst', 'entirety', 'life.The', 'guy', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'uneven', 'missed', 'point', 'life', 'uneven', 'thus', 'Mitt', 'Liv', 'som', 'Hund', 'even', 'come.The', 'performances', 'run', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'are', 'outstanding', 'singling', 'out', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'easy', 'Anton', 'Glanzelius', 'word', 'astonishing', 'here', 'comprehension', 'Ingemar', 'life', 'just', 'breathtaking', '1987', 'was', 'fantastic', 'year', 'child', 'performances', 'stunner', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'eye-opening', 'performance', 'Empire', 'Sun', 'one-two-punch', 'Gaspard', 'Manesse', 'Raphael', 'Fejto', 'who', 'just', 'blew', 'Au', 'Revoir', 'Enfants', 'fervor', 'grace', 'Glanzelius', 'worthy', 'inclusion', 'company', 'Bale', 'Glanzelius', 'Manesse', 'would', 'make', 'personal', 'Best', 'Actor', 'ballot', 'ANY', 'hesitation', 'Tomas', 'von', 'Bromssen', 'also', 'standout', 'jovial', 'portrayal', 'Gunnar', 'Ingemar', 'Uncle', 'newfound', 'guardian', 'films', 'most', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'POP', 'also', 'want', 'call', 'attention', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'given', 'Melinda', 'Kinnaman', 'sweet', 'spunky', 'portrayal', 'Saga', 'tomboy', 'vying', 'Ingemar', 'affections', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'lovable', 'film.UGH', 'love', 'movie']",N/A

He tries to cheer his mother up as best he can, but she is too far gone to really notice or care. His fondest memories are times spent at the beach with her when she was healthier and their times together were better. As a coming-of-age movie, sex plays an important (and confusing) part for the boy, from the old bedridden man in the upstairs apartment who likes him to read the lingerie ads to him, to the tomboy who is the best soccer player on his team and keeps trying to show him her breasts. The movie is full of wonderful, insightful touches. Glanzelius is marvelous.

187288,APP5MBH2BSX6I,1572523581,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[6, 7]","This truly is a wonderful film that takes place in 1960.  It is about a little boy who suffers a series of tragedies, most of all the death of his mother.  As is typical in such situations, little Ingemar loved her but doesn't know how deeply he loved her until she was gone.  It's a sad lesson, but only one of many he learns in the course of this story, wherein the drama is balanced quite nicely with humor and whimsy.  Kinda like life, huh?The film shows us the deeper wisdom Ingemar attains from his tragedies, but it also shares with us, with a uniquely Swedish touch, the beginnings of his innocent introduction to the idea of sex.  Just on the beginning cusp of puberty, Ingemar has a young blonde girlfriend who isn't very interested in the subject but goes along with childlike play about ""getting married""; an aggressive tomboy girlfriend who is more interested in the subject than he is, which makes him uncomfortable; a sick old man who has him read often from a lingerie catalog; his uncle, who is obsessed with breasts; and a beautiful blonde woman, a surrogate mother, who poses nude for a local sculptor.  These parts of Ingemar's awakening are presented with beautiful sweetness and humor, with scarcely a bit of prurient titillation.There are so many wonderful characters here that I'll not go into detail, as this review would drag on and on.  Suffice to say that the stories told here do a wonderful job of making us familiar with multiple characters and a year in their world.  I didn't notice any annoying loose ends dangling, nor any false notes in the story or its execution.  The level of acting here is terrific, a testament to Hallstrom's direction, where only a few of the non-speaking childrens' roles carry any hint of amateurishness.  There is some nudity and PG language, so take that into advisement; bottom line, even though the film is mostly full of children, it's not a kid's film.  Aside from the nudity (which would certainly be more titillating to pubescent boys than adults), the story is about coming of age, told with a nostalgia only grasped by adults.I was going to comment on the fact that the ""dog"" title seems ironic with the director named Lasse, but perhaps it's enough to point that out.  Somehow the mild humor seems compatible with this lovely little film.  Hallstrom is also known for the nearly perfect ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and, unfortunately, the superficially pretty but confused and predictable ""Chocolat.""""My Life As a Dog"" is a Swedish film with subtitles.  The subtitles seem quite thorough, whereas some foreign language films (Roman Polanski's ""Knife In the Water,"" for example) suffer through inadequate subtitles where much is said and little is translated.  In this film it's essential to read the subtitles quickly, as they tend to zip past because much is said.  Just a note in case you struggle with this aspect of such a film; unfortunately only the Swedish soundtrack is included here, no dubbing into English.  I'm generally not much on foreign language films; for years the only such film among my favorites was ""Das Boot,"" until I discovered ""Salaam Bombay!"" and this gem.

The Swedes depicted onscreen are nothing like those in the Bergman universe. They are not rich, depressed, and well educated. Ingemar and his brother and mother live in a shanty house slum, and his uncle's country place is only a little nicer, even if the scenery is much more wholesome. And despite having far more reason to piss and moan than Bergman's characters do, Ingemar is marked by a perseverance one can only refer to as `dogged.' The cinematography by J&ouml;rgen Persson is solid, although there is a repeated static shot of the cosmos, whenever Ingemar gets reflective, that looks like something from a 1950s sci fi film where the word `Science!' is ejaculated ecstatically, which should have been made to look a bit more engaging. Granted, this might be the typical textbook sort of photo that a child would associate with outer space in those days, but it still drags on the often deeper narration Ingemar provides, and simply looks cheap.While the film was based upon a novel with the same title, written by Reidar Jonsson, and the screenplay was written by Hallstr&ouml;m, Jonsson, and Brasse Brannstrom and Per Berglund, the character of Ingemar succeeds less on the words the character speaks, and mostly on the uncanny acting ability- or even inability, of Glanzelius- who never had another major starring role. There is just something `off' about little Ingemar, something which, as reflected in the screenplay, is missing in comparison to Glanzelius's portrayal. The text would lead one to believe Ingemar is just another kid, if perhaps one a bit `off,' yet Glanzelius's unaffected portrayal reveals him to be perhaps `slow' or borderline `autistic'- as he might now be labeled, especially when he goes on all fours and barks like a dog or cannot drink from a glass in public without spilling the liquid all over himself. Then there is the actor's very appearance, which has an odd, almost maniacal twinkle in his mien, akin to a young Jack Nicholson's.All in all, My Life As A Dog is a good non-Hollywood Hollywood film, albeit a deeper one, without forced emotions. It is a film that hints at a promise Hallstr&ouml;m has yet to fulfill, opening up the query over whether or not it is better to never fill potential by existence and failure or by not existing at all. Perhaps Ingemar already thought that through whilst pondering that dog high above his own canine plight?",3,Good,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,2547,"['film', 'was', 'nominated', 'won', 'several', 'awards', 'world', 'specter', 'Bergman', 'still', 'film', 'even', 'oppositionally', 'Swedes', 'depicted', 'onscreen', 'are', 'nothing', 'Bergman', 'universe', 'are', 'not', 'rich', 'depressed', 'well', 'educated', 'Ingemar', 'brother', 'mother', 'live', 'shanty', 'house', 'slum', 'uncle', 'country', 'place', 'only', 'little', 'nicer', 'even', 'scenery', 'much', 'more', 'wholesome', 'having', 'far', 'more', 'reason', 'piss', 'moan', 'Bergman', 'characters', 'do', 'Ingemar', 'marked', 'perseverance', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'refer', 'dogged', 'cinematography', 'J', 'ouml', 'rgen', 'Persson', 'solid', 'repeated', 'static', 'shot', 'cosmos', 'whenever', 'Ingemar', 'reflective', 'something', '1950s', 'sci', 'fi', 'film', 'where', 'word', 'Science', 'ejaculated', 'ecstatically', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'look', 'bit', 'more', 'engaging', 'Granted', 'might', 'be', 'typical', 'textbook', 'sort', 'photo', 'child', 'would', 'associate', 'outer', 'space', 'days', 'still', 'often', 'deeper', 'narration', 'Ingemar', 'simply', 'cheap.While', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'written', 'Reidar', 'Jonsson', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Hallstr', 'ouml', 'Jonsson', 'Brasse', 'Brannstrom', 'Per', 'Berglund', 'character', 'Ingemar', 'less', 'words', 'character', 'speaks', 'mostly', 'uncanny', 'acting', 'ability-', 'even', 'inability', 'Glanzelius-', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'major', 'starring', 'role', 'just', 'something', 'about', 'little', 'Ingemar', 'something', 'reflected', 'screenplay', 'missing', 'comparison', 'Glanzelius', 'portrayal', 'text', 'would', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'Ingemar', 'just', 'kid', 'perhaps', 'one', 'bit', 'off', 'yet', 'Glanzelius', 'unaffected', 'portrayal', 'reveals', 'be', 'perhaps', 'slow', 'borderline', ""autistic'-"", 'might', 'now', 'be', 'labeled', 'especially', 'when', 'fours', 'barks', 'dog', 'can', 'not', 'drink', 'glass', 'public', 'spilling', 'liquid', 'Then', 'actor', 'very', 'appearance', 'odd', 'almost', 'maniacal', 'twinkle', 'mien', 'akin', 'young', 'Jack', ""Nicholson's.All"", 'My', 'Life', 'A', 'Dog', 'good', 'non-Hollywood', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'deeper', 'one', 'forced', 'emotions', 'film', 'promise', 'Hallstr', 'ouml', 'm', 'yet', 'fulfill', 'opening', 'up', 'query', 'not', 'better', 'never', 'fill', 'potential', 'existence', 'failure', 'not', 'existing', 'Perhaps', 'Ingemar', 'already', 'thought', 'whilst', 'pondering', 'dog', 'high', 'own', 'canine', 'plight']",N/A

But in 1985, Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m was known for his Swedish film ""My Life as a Dog"" (Mitt liv som hund), a film based on the novel by Reidar Jonsson.The film was won various awards in different countries, including the USA winning the 45th Golden Globe Awards for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" and was nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best Director"" and ""Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium"".The film was released on DVD by the Criterion Collection back in 2003 but now the film has been selected for release on Blu-ray on Sept. 2011.VIDEO:""My Life as a Dog"" is presented in 1080p High Definition, color (1:66:1 aspect ratio).  And compared to the original DVD release, the film looks much better.  Grain is evident, there are a few white specks but the close-ups showcase the details of the film and the contrast of the film looks good.  I'm typically critical of many films on Blu-ray that are from the early to mid-'80s because they tend to look overly soft, but in the case of ""My Life as a Dog"", the picture quality is good.According to the Criterion Collection, the new digital transfer was approved by Lasse Hallstrom and was created on a Spirit 2K Datacine from a 35 mm interpositive struck from the original nitrate negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""My Life as a Dog"" is presented in Swedish monaural with English subtitles. The film is dialogue driven and dialogue is crystal clear through the center channel.According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical track print.

A touching and yet heartbreaking coming-of-age film from filmmaker Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m that resonates deeply with viewers as it gives us a perspective of a young boy who loses his family and like his own dog and the Soviet dog who died in space, Lakia, the pain he feels of being unwanted.  But also in someway, feeling like he is no different from a dog who is placed in the kennel or in outerspace with no one to love or care for them.This is a genuine feeling for any young child who loses their family, especially their parent(s) but what makes ""My Life as a Dog"" so entertaining is showcasing the purity of a child but also learning about ""grown-up"" things through the adults.In the beginning, we see Ingemar and his best friend, a girl, who establish this bond that they will be together...forever.  And to showcase their bond, they tend to hug and hold each other under a bridge while the train goes by.  We see another situation of the purity of Ingemar as Saga, the tomboy is growing breasts and she tells Ingemar to help her wrap her chests, so she can continue to be involved in sports and be treated just like the guys.Ingemar doesn't look at these girls sexually, to him...they are just normal young people his age that he plays with.  But at the same time, we see how he is thrusted into this new world where he sees all these glassmakers (including his uncle) gawking at the blonde beauty who works at the glass factory.  The woman asks Ingemar to accompany her while she poses nude for a sculptor (granted, he is kept in another room), but the only questions he asked by his uncle is if he saw anything.  Of course, the curiosity of a child of being asked such a thing, ""Why am I being asked such a question... Should I be looking for something?"".He is also asked by the elder that lives in the basement of his uncle's home to read a lingerie catalog.  Once again, for young Ingemar, he doesn't know why he is reading these to the adults but it's those questions that start to peak his curiosity.Needless to say, it's a situation that leads to Ingemar trying to find out more about why older men are into the body of an older woman and these are quite interesting ""coming-of-age"" moments during the film.But of course, the film is not about a child learning about sex, it's a film about him slowly learning how life is difficult because he compares himself to his dog Sickan who is taken away from him and the family and is supposedly staying at a kennel (when in truth, it's probably being killed) or Lakia, the dog that the Soviets put into space.  Is there anyone caring for these animals?  Or are they just displaced by humanity that no one cares about them.And in Ingemar's case, he feels unwanted.  He is too young to understand his mother's sickness but in his mind, he feels that he may have contributed to her death because of him getting into trouble.  But it's him learning how no one in the family wants him to live with him.  His uncles don't want him living in the same house and he is forced to live with an elderly woman who is lonely.Needless to say, for a young boy, being separated from your mother and brother and the dog you love and now pretty much living away from family is difficult for any young boy to comprehend and I found those scenes t be quite heartbreaking but emotionally, the efficacy of the film is due to the talent of young Anton Glanzelius to showcase that purity of a child, the not knowing what will come next and needless to say, Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m definitely found the right boy for the role.With that being said, it's important to note that some viewers may have a problem with a scene that involves Saga (the 12-year-old girl) showing her breasts to Ingemar.  It's not a sexual scene but if shown in America, you have no doubt in your mind that today's film censors would have a problem with it.  Needless to say, I figured this should be mentioned for viewers who may be sensitive to it.The Bu-ray release does contain the two special features that the original DVD had.  The 2002 interview with Lasse Hallstrom is included as well as Hallstrom's first film""Shall We Go to Your or My Place or Each Go Home Alone?"" (1973) are included as well.Overall, ""My Life as a Dog"" is a fantastic coming-of-age film that doesn't fit into the banality of similar type of films.

187306,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,1572523581,Randy Keehn,"[14, 19]","""My Life as a Dog"" is a most unusual and most enjoyable movie.  It is a Swedish film which I watched with the aid of subtitles.  It would seem to qualify as a ""coming of age"" movie because it is about a 12 year old boy and his learning about sex and human fraility.  Yet there is so much more to the story that it seems wrong to limit its' definition.I missed the first couple of minutes of the movie but I doubt that there was some grandiose explanation as to what was about to transpire.  What I saw was the story of a 12 year old boy (Ingemar) whose mother is ill enough that it affects their relationship.  (His father is not a part of his life).  At times she is his best friend and at times she is his worst enemy (with his brother a close second).  Maybe that strikes us somewhat of our own relationships with our parents at that age.  However, this relationship seems well beyond the ordinary.  Ingemar has a child's normal curiosity and he seems to always being doing the wrong thing; usually as a result of something his brother did.  This strains his mother's frail health.  At one point, the mother needs so much peace and quiet that Ingemar is sent to live with his uncle up north.  There the movie takes a turn for the better from our perspective.  His uncle is a happy-go-lucky fellow who takes Ingemar under his wing.  Ingemar makes many friends and seems to be having such a good time that we think it's too bad that he has to return home to mama after a few months.  However, the director lets us know that home is where Ingemar's heart is.  His heart is also with his dog who was sent to the kennel when Ingemar left for the summer.  Well, enough of the plot.The many scenes throughout the movie are well written directed and acted.  Sometimes the movie seems more of a sequence of scenes rather than a movie with a theme.  However, the theme is there and it was the title of the movie that helped me see it.  Ingemar has a number of scenes where he shares his youthful thoughts and observations.  He is fascinated by Laitka, the Russian dog who went up in space (this movie takes place around the late 1950's).  He understood Laitka to have died because the Russians did not send along enough food or make any arrangements for his return; they just used him for their purposes and then were done with him.  I understood this to be Ingemar's life to that point.  He was brought into the world without any proper provisions for sufficient love and nurturing.  His future is unplanned as he is sent to wherever he'll fit in without any real concern as to what best for him.  Ultimately, there is no place for him to return to.This is an excellent movie that combines a great script, excellent directing, and very good acting.  The cast is all new to me and they were well-assembled.  There are a lot of unusual characters that give the movie a special sort of seaoning.""My Life as a Dog"" is not a depressing movie.  Rather, there is hope as the movie leaves us knowing that Ingemar has lost his two best friends in the world but has just discovered that he is starting to find some replacements.",5,"One Part Humor, One Part Poignant, One Part Disturbing",1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,3112,"['Life', 'Dog', 'most', 'unusual', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Swedish', 'film', 'watched', 'aid', 'subtitles', 'would', 'seem', 'qualify', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'learning', 'sex', 'human', 'fraility', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'wrong', 'limit', 'definition.I', 'missed', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'movie', 'doubt', 'was', 'grandiose', 'explanation', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'transpire', 'What', 'saw', 'was', 'story', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Ingemar', 'mother', 'ill', 'enough', 'relationship', 'father', 'not', 'part', 'life', 'times', 'best', 'friend', 'times', 'worst', 'enemy', 'brother', 'close', 'second', 'Maybe', 'strikes', 'somewhat', 'own', 'relationships', 'parents', 'age', 'However', 'relationship', 'well', 'ordinary', 'Ingemar', 'child', 'normal', 'curiosity', 'always', 'being', 'doing', 'wrong', 'thing', 'usually', 'result', 'something', 'brother', 'did', 'mother', 'frail', 'health', 'one', 'point', 'mother', 'so', 'much', 'peace', 'quiet', 'Ingemar', 'sent', 'live', 'uncle', 'up', 'north', 'movie', 'turn', 'better', 'perspective', 'uncle', 'happy-go-lucky', 'fellow', 'who', 'Ingemar', 'wing', 'Ingemar', 'many', 'friends', 'be', 'having', 'such', 'good', 'time', 'think', 'too', 'bad', 'return', 'home', 'mama', 'few', 'months', 'However', 'director', 'know', 'home', 'where', 'Ingemar', 'heart', 'heart', 'also', 'dog', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'kennel', 'when', 'Ingemar', 'left', 'summer', 'Well', 'enough', 'plot.The', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'Sometimes', 'movie', 'more', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'rather', 'movie', 'theme', 'However', 'theme', 'there', 'was', 'title', 'movie', 'helped', 'see', 'Ingemar', 'number', 'scenes', 'where', 'shares', 'youthful', 'thoughts', 'observations', 'fascinated', 'Laitka', 'Russian', 'dog', 'who', 'went', 'up', 'space', 'movie', 'place', 'late', '1950', 'understood', 'Laitka', 'have', 'died', 'Russians', 'did', 'not', 'send', 'along', 'enough', 'food', 'make', 'arrangements', 'return', 'just', 'used', 'purposes', 'then', 'were', 'done', 'understood', 'be', 'Ingemar', 'life', 'point', 'was', 'brought', 'world', 'proper', 'provisions', 'sufficient', 'love', 'nurturing', 'future', 'unplanned', 'sent', 'wherever', ""'ll"", 'fit', 'real', 'concern', 'what', 'best', 'Ultimately', 'place', 'return', 'to.This', 'excellent', 'movie', 'great', 'script', 'excellent', 'directing', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'cast', 'new', 'were', 'well-assembled', 'are', 'lot', 'unusual', 'characters', 'give', 'movie', 'special', 'sort', 'seaoning', 'Life', 'Dog', 'not', 'depressing', 'movie', 'Rather', 'hope', 'movie', 'knowing', 'Ingemar', 'lost', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'world', 'just', 'discovered', 'starting', 'find', 'replacements']",N/A

It helps to keep a little distance.""  A heartwarming story of growing pains, My Life as a Dog traces  the tears and laughter of a thirteen-year-old Swedish boy struggling to  find balance between the gravity of death and flamboyancy of youth.  Carefully expanding the path of childhood through trials of time, director  Lasse Hallstrom brings forth a moving tale unfolded in the eyes of Ingemar,  a captivating boy whose heartfelt concerns for dogs burgeon into love for  life.  Inspired by the first dog sent into space by the USSR space  program, Ingemar remains unscathed by life's tragedies as he bravely  embarks on a journey to fit himself into a world of complexities.  Stunningly portrayed by young actor Anton Glanzelius, the energetic,  insightful, and often-troubled hero comes alive seeking joy of a sad life  as his mother lies dying.  Even as Ingemar and his brother are sent away to  different relatives in the summer to allow their weakening mother rest,  Ingemar is constantly haunted by memories of a mother with a ""robust, sexy  laugh"" who never grows tired of his stories.  Ingemar temporarily finds  peace in his eccentric uncle's house as he shyly steps into the light and  befriends a pretty young tomboy portrayed by Melinda Kenneman, who leads a  contradictory life herself trying to cope with her growing sexual urges  while maintaining a tough image on the soccer team as well as boxing floor.  Focussing on Ingemar's sympathy for deserted creatures such as  Laika, who was left to die in space, as well as his own mutt Sikan later  died in the kennel, the director skillfully narrows in on life's details  drawing powerful parallels between Ingemar's alienation and the dogs'  desertion.  Almost taking pleasure in the ruggedness of growing-up,  Glanz&eacute;lius's Ingemar never ceases to find himself trapped in  troubles-whether it is setting fire on trash dumps, spilling milk on  himself, or crashing through the glass roof attempting to steal a glimpse  of a model in nude.  While peacefully observing a world in motion from the  persecptive of an outsider, Ingemar gradually blends into a rural community  and finds himself an inseparable part of the town's lighthearted approach  to hardships after the death of her mother.  Deemed not as simple tale  of maturing, My Life as a Dog presents the bittersweet flavor of childhood  through the clear eyes of a bittersweet boy.  Despite few awkward  transitions and scenes of sexual awakenings, this film touches the human  heart and produces a vague echo in audiences' memories.  Complemented with  superb casting, My Life as a Dog refocuses society's view on children who  see the world through a totally unique perspective.  Of course, our hero's  perspective undergoes the transition from a deserted dog to that of a human  surrounded by life's warm pleasures.",4,Heartwarming Coming-of-Age Tale,946857600,"01 3, 2000",2000,2968,"['have', 'compare', 'hero', 'charming', 'yet', 'poignant', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'so', 'can', 'keep', 'perspective', 'keep', 'little', 'distance', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'growing', 'pains', 'My', 'Life', 'Dog', 'tears', 'laughter', 'thirteen-year-old', 'Swedish', 'boy', 'struggling', 'find', 'balance', 'gravity', 'death', 'flamboyancy', 'youth', 'Carefully', 'expanding', 'path', 'childhood', 'trials', 'time', 'director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'forth', 'moving', 'tale', 'unfolded', 'eyes', 'Ingemar', 'captivating', 'boy', 'heartfelt', 'concerns', 'dogs', 'burgeon', 'love', 'life', 'Inspired', 'first', 'dog', 'sent', 'space', 'USSR', 'space', 'program', 'Ingemar', 'unscathed', 'life', 'tragedies', 'bravely', 'journey', 'fit', 'world', 'complexities', 'Stunningly', 'portrayed', 'young', 'actor', 'Anton', 'Glanzelius', 'energetic', 'insightful', 'often-troubled', 'hero', 'alive', 'seeking', 'joy', 'sad', 'life', 'mother', 'dying', 'Even', 'Ingemar', 'brother', 'are', 'sent', 'away', 'different', 'relatives', 'summer', 'allow', 'weakening', 'mother', 'rest', 'Ingemar', 'constantly', 'haunted', 'memories', 'mother', 'robust', 'sexy', 'laugh', 'who', 'never', 'tired', 'stories', 'Ingemar', 'temporarily', 'peace', 'eccentric', 'uncle', 'house', 'steps', 'light', 'pretty', 'young', 'tomboy', 'portrayed', 'Melinda', 'Kenneman', 'who', 'contradictory', 'life', 'trying', 'cope', 'growing', 'sexual', 'urges', 'maintaining', 'tough', 'image', 'soccer', 'team', 'as', 'well', 'boxing', 'floor', 'Focussing', 'Ingemar', 'sympathy', 'deserted', 'creatures', 'such', 'Laika', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'die', 'space', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'mutt', 'Sikan', 'later', 'died', 'kennel', 'director', 'skillfully', 'life', 'details', 'drawing', 'powerful', 'parallels', 'Ingemar', 'alienation', 'dogs', 'desertion', 'Almost', 'taking', 'pleasure', 'ruggedness', 'growing-up', 'Glanz', 'eacute', 'Ingemar', 'never', 'find', 'trapped', 'troubles-whether', 'setting', 'fire', 'trash', 'dumps', 'spilling', 'milk', 'crashing', 'glass', 'roof', 'attempting', 'steal', 'glimpse', 'model', 'nude', 'peacefully', 'observing', 'world', 'motion', 'persecptive', 'outsider', 'Ingemar', 'gradually', 'rural', 'community', 'inseparable', 'part', 'town', 'lighthearted', 'approach', 'hardships', 'death', 'mother', 'Deemed', 'not', 'as', 'simple', 'tale', 'maturing', 'My', 'Life', 'Dog', 'bittersweet', 'flavor', 'childhood', 'clear', 'eyes', 'bittersweet', 'boy', 'few', 'awkward', 'transitions', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'awakenings', 'film', 'human', 'heart', 'vague', 'echo', 'audiences', 'memories', 'Complemented', 'superb', 'casting', 'My', 'Life', 'Dog', 'society', 'view', 'children', 'who', 'see', 'world', 'totally', 'unique', 'perspective', 'course', 'hero', 'perspective', 'transition', 'deserted', 'dog', 'human', 'surrounded', 'life', 'warm', 'pleasures']",N/A

Though he has done other films they are American or British made. ""Chocolat,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" and ""Something to Talk About."" He is also very well known for directing the music videos for the world famous Swedish pop group, ABBA.The film is about a 12 year old boy in 1950's Sweden. He is very rambunctious and when his mother falls ill, his antics prevent her from recovering, so he is sent to live with his uncle. He meets new people there and makes friends with the towspeople. He often compares his misfortunes with those worse off than he is.The film has some excelent scenes of the more rural areas Sweden and some fine photography also. It remains a very popular film to this day and has recieved or been nominated for many awards. It won a golden globe for best foreign film and was nominated for best director by the AMPAS. Though it is described by many people as a family film, it got a PG-13 rating in the US. Mainly for nudity and sexual diaglogue. There is a half second of full frontal female nudity, though non-sexual, it still may be a cause for parental concern. The other scene involves material that I feel uncomfortable mentioning but parents are urged to watch the film themselves before letting their children see it.The special features on the Criterion DVD include Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m's first film, ""Ska vi g hem till dej eller till mej eller var och en till sitt?"" which translates to, ""Shall We Go to My Place or Your Place or Each Go Home Alone?"" This film has some explicit sex scenes and definately not appropriate for children.There is also a theatrical trailer and an interview with Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m.

187318,AZWMGBRZ3GYG,1572523581,Thomas Aquinas,"[9, 10]","Why is this my favorite movie? Because it simply presents life, in all its joys, griefs, paradoxes and mysteries. What puts this movie in a class by itself is the spirit of hope that runs through the movie, especially in the main character, Ingmar, whose indomitable spirit shines in the face of change and tragedy. Yet the movie never drifts into sentimentality. In the end, it's a movie about the mystery of love.The central theme is Ingmar's ""life as a dog."" Like the dog that was shot into space by the Soviet's without regard to its safe return to earth, Ingmar, like most of us, seems to have been ""shot into life"" alone. The movie is a series of vignettes that combine in what seems to be a haphazard manner, but reflects, to my mind, the most meaningful and transcendant moments of our lives, moments that simply cannot be categorized.These moments are funny, sad, tragic, hopeful, and above all, poignant. The scene where Ingmar boxes with his tomboy friend, ending in an embrace, defies words in its sublimity. The scene in which Ingmar's mother breaks down, is absolutely heartbreaking. And the wistful scenes of Ingmar's ""marriage"" to the neighbor girl, and his brother's description of intercourse to the neighborhood children, will remind you of the revelations of youth.But there are insights into adulthood as well, as the happy-go-lucky uncle, and his happy but impish bride, contrast with the prim and glum foster parents, the perverted modern artist, and the man who is perpetually fixing his roof.In the end, you'll be celebrating with Sweden, as Ingmar (get it?)
