435257,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304766750,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","My wife is a pretty big fan of Bean.  She had been ranting and raving about me needing to see this movie for some time.  I never really had a big desire to see it (not really my thing) but I eventually gave it.I'm still a tad indifferent.The fact remains that I laughed.  In fact, the whole `destruction of Whistler's Mother' was rather hilarious.  Personally though, I found the rest of the movie to be ridiculously uneven.  I like intelligence in my humor.  I think that it just boils down to personal preference.  I'm not really a huge fan of `stupid funny'.  That said, I have been known to fall on the floor in laughter while watching certain Will Ferrell comedies, so I do occasionally wholly enjoy `stupid funny'.`Bean' just didn't do it for me.The film revolves around a dim-witted security guard at a museum Britain who is despised by his co-workers and is sent to America to oversea the transferal of `Whistler's Mother' from the British museum to the US.  He is mistaken for an art scholar and trusted with the painting, but a lot of outlandish madness ensues because of it.Oh yeah, and the ending is rather heartwarming (in a totally superficial way).Rowan Atkinson is rather hilarious.  His facial expressions and mannerisms are really funny, but the films plot and scripting are one-note and hold him back from doing anything truly noteworthy.  The character development is really ridiculous (the whole Langley family dynamic is unbelievable and absurd) and the way that the gags are strung together never once gives you an impression that it is anything more than a group of bits thrown together with a weakly realized connective tissue.The film, while at times humorous, misses big time.",2,I expected a lot more...,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,1703,"['wife', 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'Bean', 'had', 'been', 'ranting', 'raving', 'needing', 'see', 'movie', 'time', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'big', 'desire', 'see', 'not', 'really', 'thing', 'eventually', 'gave', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'tad', 'indifferent.The', 'fact', 'laughed', 'fact', 'whole', 'destruction', 'Whistler', 'Mother', 'was', 'rather', 'hilarious', 'Personally', 'found', 'rest', 'movie', 'be', 'ridiculously', 'uneven', 'like', 'intelligence', 'humor', 'think', 'just', 'down', 'personal', 'preference', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'huge', 'fan', 'stupid', 'funny', 'said', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'fall', 'floor', 'laughter', 'watching', 'certain', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'comedies', 'do', 'occasionally', 'wholly', 'enjoy', 'stupid', ""funny'."", 'Bean', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'me.The', 'film', 'around', 'dim-witted', 'security', 'guard', 'museum', 'Britain', 'who', 'despised', 'co-workers', 'sent', 'America', 'oversea', 'transferal', 'Whistler', 'Mother', 'British', 'museum', 'US', 'mistaken', 'art', 'scholar', 'trusted', 'painting', 'lot', 'outlandish', 'madness', 'ensues', 'it.Oh', 'yeah', 'ending', 'rather', 'heartwarming', 'totally', 'superficial', 'way', '.Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'rather', 'hilarious', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'films', 'plot', 'scripting', 'are', 'one-note', 'hold', 'back', 'doing', 'anything', 'truly', 'noteworthy', 'character', 'development', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'whole', 'Langley', 'family', 'dynamic', 'unbelievable', 'absurd', 'way', 'gags', 'are', 'strung', 'together', 'never', 'once', 'impression', 'anything', 'more', 'group', 'bits', 'thrown', 'together', 'weakly', 'realized', 'connective', 'tissue.The', 'film', 'times', 'humorous', 'big', 'time']",Bean the Movie VHS

One of the funniest British guys that happens to really appeal to Americans, this movie shows us why Mr. Bean has had such a successful run with his famous British comedy show.  He never speaks much, but his actions speak volumes about how funny he is.This movie does a great job of capturing the feel of his TV show and bringing on the laughs nonstop.  Bringing him over to America was a great idea for a film storyline, because his character brought me to tears in laughter several times.  The Americans didn't know how to react to him and just thought he was really strange, and Mr. Bean didn't seem phased by this at all.  In fact, I think he LIKED people thinking he was weird.I liked the part where a turkey was on Bean's head and he was dancing around, and especially the part where his pants got wet while during an important business meeting and he didn't want people thinking he wet himself, so he was walking around hiding the wet spot on his pants, and during one scene, he was trying to dry his pants by walking back and forth across a moving fan, lol.  Meanwhile all the people at the business meeting were looking at him like the guy has a few loose screws, lol.The Mr. Bean character is truly a mangificent one, and this movie is recommended to anyone who appreciates a funny comedy.",5,great stuff,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,1332,"['one', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'One', 'funniest', 'British', 'guys', 'really', 'appeal', 'Americans', 'movie', 'why', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'had', 'successful', 'run', 'famous', 'British', 'comedy', 'show', 'never', 'much', 'actions', 'speak', 'volumes', 'how', 'funny', 'is.This', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'feel', 'TV', 'show', 'bringing', 'laughs', 'nonstop', 'Bringing', 'America', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'film', 'storyline', 'character', 'brought', 'tears', 'laughter', 'several', 'times', 'Americans', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'react', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'strange', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'phased', 'fact', 'think', 'people', 'thinking', 'was', 'weird.I', 'liked', 'part', 'where', 'turkey', 'was', 'Bean', 'head', 'was', 'dancing', 'around', 'especially', 'part', 'where', 'pants', 'got', 'wet', 'important', 'business', 'meeting', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'people', 'thinking', 'so', 'was', 'walking', 'around', 'hiding', 'wet', 'spot', 'pants', 'one', 'scene', 'was', 'trying', 'dry', 'pants', 'walking', 'back', 'forth', 'moving', 'fan', 'lol', 'Meanwhile', 'people', 'business', 'meeting', 'were', 'looking', 'guy', 'few', 'loose', 'screws', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'character', 'truly', 'mangificent', 'one', 'movie', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'funny', 'comedy']",Bean the Movie VHS
435261,A2JJSCIGPZDWHI,6304766750,BENJAMIN MILER,"[6, 9]","Don't get me wrong, I love Mr. Bean. I love how Rowan Atkinson plays this nosey guy who sticks his nose in to other people's business and never speaks a word. Not to mention the teddy bear, where on some episodes its head is too small, and on other episodes its head is too big. The only drawback was there were so few episodes made between the 1989-1995 time period, no more than two made a year. Then why did I give the 1997 movie a two star rating. Well, put it this way: Mr. Bean does not look good with Hollywood style production. The production was very down to earth on the old TV series, but with the movie, every Hollywood cliche is put in to use and it falls flat. Plus it's set in America where Bean just looks so out of place. Not to mention, I find the TV series hilarious, but the movie really falls flat in the funny department. The old TV series were filmed in England, which fits fine with this type of humor. Being a lover of some of the better Britcoms out there like Monty Python, Keeping Up Appearances, and of course Mr. Bean, this movie is a prime example of what not to do with a movie: try to Americanize a Britcom.",2,The TV series is better,1007769600,"12 8, 2001",2001,1140,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'love', 'how', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'nosey', 'guy', 'who', 'nose', 'other', 'people', 'business', 'never', 'word', 'Not', 'mention', 'teddy', 'bear', 'where', 'episodes', 'head', 'too', 'small', 'other', 'episodes', 'head', 'too', 'big', 'only', 'drawback', 'was', 'were', 'so', 'few', 'episodes', 'made', '1989-1995', 'time', 'period', 'more', 'two', 'made', 'year', 'Then', 'why', 'did', 'give', '1997', 'movie', 'two', 'star', 'rating', 'Well', 'put', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'not', 'look', 'good', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'production', 'production', 'was', 'very', 'down', 'earth', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'cliche', 'put', 'use', 'flat', 'set', 'America', 'where', 'Bean', 'just', 'so', 'place', 'Not', 'mention', 'find', 'TV', 'series', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'really', 'flat', 'funny', 'department', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'were', 'filmed', 'England', 'fine', 'type', 'humor', 'Being', 'lover', 'better', 'Britcoms', 'there', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Appearances', 'course', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'movie', 'prime', 'example', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'movie', 'try', 'Americanize', 'Britcom']",Bean the Movie VHS

435266,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,6304766750,Danno,"[7, 15]","Rowan Atkinson is, without a doubt, one of Britain's funniest comedians. His ""Mr. Bean"" series, available on DVD, presents Atkinson's perfectly modern British update of classic silent physical clowns like Keaton, Lloyd, Chaplin, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Mr. Bean himself is a mischievious creature who, like a little boy, is prone to both extreme malevolence as well as extreme silliness. He's an unforgettable character, and Atkinson devised several extremely clever skits to showcase this. The ""Mr. Bean"" boxed set is brilliant.""Bean,"" however, is a mistake. If you love Mr.Bean, skip directly to the last third of the film in which the director finally allows Atkinson to be himself and make the audience laugh. The rest of the film is a poorly conceived attempt to meld Mr. Bean's cartoonlike persona to a standard American-style family comedy. The plot and flat production values kept reminding me of the low budget comedies of the 1980s that wound up being shown on HBO every Saturday afternoon. The basic idea of the film is a sound one - the famous painting ""Whistler's Mother"" is being transported to the USA and Bean, through a misunderstanding, is sent with it as an ""art expert.""Throughout the first two-thirds of the film, Bean sticks out like a sore thumb. In much the same way that MGM insisted that the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy soften up their humor, every attempt is made to change Mr. Bean from a trickster into a well-meaning oddball who only wants to help his bland co-stars find happiness. On the TV series, Bean gets himself into trouble because he is trying to do things ""correctly"" whereas here he gets himself into trouble trying to help. It's funny watching pratfalls when they backfire on the person doing them; it's not as funny when the pratfalls have consequences on other characters.Younger children will enjoy this movie, as most of the comedy is age-appropriate.

435267,A34WSL6RZNFJAN,6304766750,Darko,"[1, 2]","I saw this film at the local theater when I was but a boy in 1997. Batman and Robin was a complete f***ing failure that year but I had something to bounce back on. And that was Bean. This movie was too hillarious for words. Rowan Atkinson is one of the greatest comedic masterminds of all time. He can take one simple mistake such as for example, sneezing on an important piece of American history like the &quot;Whistler's Mother&quot; painting and turning it into a full scale disaster involving paint thinner, breaking and entering, bathroom humor, and an incredibly moving speech and make it so frickin funny that you have to see it again. I must admit, I saw Bean 3 times that year and it got funnier every time. It's like a classic film such as Forrest Gump or Star Wars. Films like that get better and better everytime because you notice something new and it feels like watching a brand new movie. That's what makes movie watching so worthwhile. It starts to grow on you. But anyhow, Bean is probably one of the greatest comedies of all time and it only gets better because behind this great comedy there was an even greater television series. In 1998, the Fox family channel which is now ABC family swept into my cable company's channel list and Mr Bean was one of the shows that came on all the time. And it's even funnier that the movie. Some of the movie's bits came from the show such as Bean getting the turkey stuck to his head. If you buy this dvd which you should, buy the dvd sets of the tv series.

D., to preside over an art exhibition featuring Whistler's Mother, meeting with gallery caretaker David Langley, with whom he is to stay for a couple of weeks until the unveiling. Unbeknownst to his american acquaintances, Mr. Bean is actually only a caretaker. When asked what he does exactly, he accurately states,""I sit in the corner, and look at pictures.""He becomes acquainted with his family - a young boy who thinks he's ""cool"", a teenage girl whose entire perpsective deals with dating, judging Mr. Bean on some sort of  1-10 stud level, the wife who despises him, comparing him to a martian, with only Langley willing to grant him the benefit of the doubt, which does actually turn out to be quite a mistake, as the painting is ruined by a sneeze - poor Mr. Bean tries to clean it up, but sadly, every effort is met with worsening consquences. To rectify the situation, ""Ninja Bean"" actually initiates a solution wherein he replaces the portrait with a poster, adding some eggs, bubblegum, and nail polish for substance. Well, it seems that he actually does a pretty good job surmising the overall impression of Whistler's Mother during his 'analysis' {really, the most Mr. Bean has ever spoken}. Also amusing is the manner in which he distracts the security guard on night watch.Mr. Bean takes in Hollywood and sections of surrounding L.A., from cruising down Hollywood Boulevard to enjoying the attractions at the Santa Monica pier, as the quintessential tourist, learning some very interesting gesticulations along the way.He finally returns to his British home, snuggles with Teddy, and admires the prize of his trip, featuring a hilarious drawing of his own character of where Whistler's Mother's face should be.I feel Rowan Atkinson did a marvellous performance as the cinematic Bean, bringing the character to wonderful life for the big screen. A delightful addition to the series quite well done.__________________For those unfamiliar, Mr. Bean is a quietly awkward well-dressed British jester somewhat resembling a Pee Wee Herman, who manages to communicate through various sounds and hand-gestures. Mainly a slapstick character, he manages to find himself in exagerrated and oft-times dangerous predicaments wherein unexpected fortuitousness always manages to occur, what I sometimes refer to as ""the luck of the gump"".I have long-since been a fantom of Rowan Atkinson's comedy, from Mr. Bean to various skits, and Black Adder.

Evidently, my wife must have purchased them put them there where they got lost in our cluttered collection. Well, I'd never heard of Mr. Bean, The Whole Bean or Rowan Atkinson who plays him, but she's lived in London for three years and Mr. Bean was a popular program on the telly, so it figures that she might have put the set there.It's difficult to explain Mr. Bean to the uninitiated. The DVDs are a series of skits presented as British TV episodes, each lasting a little less than a half hour. Altogether, there are 14 episodes and each episode has three or four parts. The skits have very few spoken words, but are accompanied by a laugh track. The material represents British humor, through and through. Watch these and you'll be laughing. Trust me. Mr. Bean is Rowan Atkinson who is a comedian and something of a mime. The skits are acted out, sometimes with Mr. Bean only and sometimes with other participants. Almost all of the humor is very physical and a lot of it is really corny. To what might it compare? Well, I'd say it was something like some silent movies, except there's sound but very little speaking. Some of the skits are something like Red Skelton's mime acts or perhaps even a bit of Pee Wee Herman. But, make no mistake, Atkinson is uniquely his own act.Well, I suppose it was inevitable that there would be a ""Bean - The Movie"" and I found such on the five-dollar DVD rack at a nearby Wall-Mart. In this movie, Mr Bean is an employee of a London gallery, much to everyone's dismay. Well, the gallery had ""Whistler's Mother"" purchased by an American with a lot of money and little taste and the painting was to be transported to a Los Angeles gallery. The British Gallery sent Mr. Bean along as a guardian, but mostly it was just a way of getting rid of him. Well, in Los Angeles, the LA Gallery people took him as an expert and he became, in their minds, Dr. Bean, one of the world's greatest authorities. Of course, he was a buffoon and the movie has to do with his antics and the American's ability, or lack of it, in handling the situation. It's funny, and makes for enjoyable viewing. I'd suggest that the TV episodes be viewed first just to adadjust to this rather strange fellow. Watching the movie first, without the background, would make for a really strange movie. Personally, I thought the TV skits were best. Stretching this Bean thing into a full-length movie is just a bit too much. In any case, enjoy.Gary Peterson",4,Dr. Bean?

Of course there are many contenders for that title, more all the time now that Hollywood is in an unimaginative slump, but this movie commits the unforgivable sin of comedy: it gets the tone wrong. Comedy is entirely about tone (as are cartoons). Get it wrong and it doesn't matter how much you get right. Of course, there is plenty else to help the film lope along to its failed finish. The entire cast is miscast except for Rowan Atkinson. How much better these things play in the low budget BBC sets, since they are essentially stand-up mixed with filmed plays.Compare this to Johnny English, a venerable vehicle for Atkinson's considerable talents and there is no comparison. Why? Because JE is understated and plays off the already subtle Bond canon, itself quintessentially British. Whereas the ghastly mistake that is Bean plays like the worst over the top laugh track and all boisterous American comedy (exactly the sort of non- funny sitcoms that have dominated current American TV since Friends managed to walk the precarious line).

The previous reviews of &quot;Bean&quot; come from two camps, each equally certain that they alone understand this film, either 5 stars or one with  few in between.  Well, let me add my own analysis to this over-analyzed  subject.  Yes, Bean is in California.  This is the big screen and little  English barber shop pantomimes, while perfect for the cozy confines of the  British television series, wouldn't have translated to a full-length  feature, especially one introducing Mr. Bean to many American viewers for  the first time.  And yes, Bean speaks.  That was inevitable in the movie.  There had to be some compromises (or call them modifications, depending  upon which camp you're coming from).  The most substantial change was to  Bean's basic character.  Let's face it.  The Bean of the television series  is not a nice person.  He may not understand immediately every situation  life throws him into, but as soon as he catches on he's up to some  malicious mischief.  I once heard his character accurately described as  &quot; a hideous cocktail of innocence and malevolence.&quot;  This  wouldn't have cut it in a Hollywood production.  They didn't need to employ  a troop of marketing consultants to study the demographics of their  potential audience.  It was the public at large, all ages and persuasions,  not a core group of Bean cultists huddled around their tellys and giggling  at the fate of Bean's latest victims.  So, yes, they did soften Bean's  basic instincts but try to get over it because here's the point:  IT'S  STILL FUNNY.

435315,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6304766750,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","Based upon the BBC series MR. BEAN, BEAN THE MOVIE brings Rowan Atkinson&#8217;s famous British character to the United States. The famous painting ARRANGEMENT IN GREY AND BLACK #1 (aka WHISTLER&#8217;S MOTHER) has been purchased by a wealthy American General (Burt Reynolds) and is being brought back to the United States. After failing to fire him for ineptitude for his performance, the governing board at the museum Mr. Bean works decides to send him to America for 2-3 months to accompany the famous painting (and get him out of their hair for a spell). So, Mr. Bean arrives in America where everyone calls him Dr. Bean (it&#8217;s assumed he must have a doctorate in some field in art). Instead of staying at a hotel, the curator of the museum, David Langley (Peter MacNicol), arranges for &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Bean to stay with him and his family. Of course, things do not go as expected. &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Bean&#8217;s strange behavior leads to a series of unfortunate events that threaten David&#8217;s career and family leaving it up to Bean to right the wrongs he has caused.I really like the character of Mr. Bean. He&#8217;s like a ten-year-old kid in the body of an older man. I&#8217;ve only seen a few episodes of the MR. BEAN tv series, but I found many of the sketches incredibly funny. Some of the sketches from the show reemerge in BEAN THE MOVIE, but there are some new ones, too.Although, MR. BEAN was a huge tv success in England, the show initially didn&#8217;t have much more than a cult following in the United States when it was on the air.  BEAN THE MOVIE seems to have been an attempt to capitalize on the British popularity of the tv show, but make it work for an American audience. In that sense, the movie fails. The character is the same, but most everything about the story seems wrong. Instead of a full-length movie about Mr. Bean, BEAN THE MOVIE is more like a series of comedy sketches lightly tied together. It reminds me of all those movies from the late 1980s and throughout the early 1990s that were based off of Saturday Night Live sketches. Most of those SNL movies were failures because a comedy sketch doesn&#8217;t usually work for anything over thirty minutes. BEAN THE MOVIE isn&#8217;t as bad as many of those SNL movies because the character was already a part of a much larger world in the tv show. However, it&#8217;s a similar concept and many of the situations and jokes in BEAN THE MOVIE feel forced.It&#8217;s not that BEAN THE MOVIE is a horrible movie, because it&#8217;s not. It has some really funny segments. However, the humor is uneven.On a completely different note, it was interesting seeing a pre-NUM3ERS Peter MacNicol in a movie. I know he&#8217;s done other things, but the only thing I ever knew he was in was NUM3ERS.Overall, BEAN THE MOVIE is a funny movie that seems to have more of an appeal for children rather than adults. It&#8217;s not as funny as the Mr. Bean tv show, but it&#8217;s not as bad as some SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE movies it seems inspired by. Also, in terms of movie history, BEAN THE MOVIE was the first movie ever to gross $100 million dollars overseas before being released in the United States.",3,Mr. Bean In America,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,3184,"['Based', 'BBC', 'series', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', '8217', 'famous', 'British', 'character', 'United', 'States', 'famous', 'painting', 'ARRANGEMENT', 'IN', 'GREY', 'AND', 'BLACK', '1', 'WHISTLER', '8217', 'S', 'MOTHER', 'been', 'purchased', 'wealthy', 'American', 'General', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'United', 'States', 'failing', 'fire', 'ineptitude', 'performance', 'governing', 'board', 'museum', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'send', 'America', '2-3', 'months', 'accompany', 'famous', 'painting', 'get', 'hair', 'spell', 'So', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'America', 'where', 'everyone', 'Dr.', 'Bean', '8217', 's', 'assumed', 'must', 'have', 'doctorate', 'field', 'art', 'Instead', 'staying', 'hotel', 'curator', 'museum', 'David', 'Langley', 'Peter', 'MacNicol', '8220', 'Dr.', '8221', 'Bean', 'stay', 'family', 'course', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'expected', '8220', 'Dr.', '8221', 'Bean', '8217', 'strange', 'behavior', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'threaten', 'David', '8217', 'career', 'family', 'leaving', 'Bean', 'right', 'wrongs', 'caused.I', 'really', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Bean', '8217', 's', 'ten-year-old', 'kid', 'body', 'older', 'man', '8217', 'only', 'seen', 'few', 'episodes', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'tv', 'series', 'found', 'many', 'sketches', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'sketches', 'show', 'reemerge', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'are', 'new', 'ones', 'too.Although', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'was', 'huge', 'tv', 'success', 'England', 'show', 'initially', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'cult', 'following', 'United', 'States', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'have', 'been', 'attempt', 'capitalize', 'British', 'popularity', 'tv', 'show', 'make', 'work', 'American', 'audience', 'sense', 'movie', 'character', 'same', 'most', 'everything', 'story', 'wrong', 'Instead', 'full-length', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'more', 'series', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'lightly', 'tied', 'together', 'movies', 'late', '1980s', 'early', '1990s', 'were', 'based', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'sketches', 'Most', 'SNL', 'movies', 'were', 'failures', 'comedy', 'sketch', 'doesn', '8217', 'usually', 'work', 'anything', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'isn', '8217', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'SNL', 'movies', 'character', 'was', 'already', 'part', 'much', 'larger', 'world', 'tv', 'show', 'However', '8217', 's', 'similar', 'concept', 'many', 'situations', 'jokes', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'feel', 'forced.It', '8217', 'not', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'horrible', 'movie', '8217', 'not', 'really', 'funny', 'segments', 'However', 'humor', 'uneven.On', 'completely', 'different', 'note', 'was', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'pre-NUM3ERS', 'Peter', 'MacNicol', 'movie', 'know', '8217', 'done', 'other', 'things', 'only', 'thing', 'ever', 'knew', 'was', 'was', 'NUM3ERS.Overall', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'funny', 'movie', 'have', 'more', 'appeal', 'children', 'rather', 'adults', '8217', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'tv', 'show', '8217', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIVE', 'movies', 'inspired', 'Also', 'terms', 'movie', 'history', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'gross', '100', 'million', 'dollars', 'overseas', 'being', 'released', 'United', 'States']",Bean the Movie VHS

However, Mr. Bean's Holiday was more of a solidified than this one. Rowan Atkinson acting like a plum is what makes the Mr. Bean character stand out, period! It is a little bored of out itself and kind of veers the course of being its own film and skimming the origin story, which for many British audiences, might be confusing. Still, it is fun to watch something of an homage to Laurel & Hardy, French miming, and The Three Stooges.""",3,"Funny at moments but not as good as the original, sequel, and animated series",1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,512,"['Comical', 'corny', 'unserious', 'offbeat-', 'what', 'Bean', 'best', 'doing', 'However', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Holiday', 'was', 'more', 'solidified', 'one', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'acting', 'plum', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'character', 'stand', 'out', 'period', 'little', 'bored', 'kind', 'veers', 'course', 'being', 'own', 'film', 'skimming', 'origin', 'story', 'many', 'British', 'audiences', 'might', 'be', 'confusing', 'Still', 'fun', 'watch', 'something', 'homage', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'French', 'miming', 'Three', 'Stooges']",Bean the Movie VHS
