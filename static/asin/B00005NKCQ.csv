Then I purchased the VHS set in not knowing soon that it will be on DVD, so I bought the DVD set but the 40th anniversary set. That it has extra features, out takes, map of the village, triva questions, etc.  Very much love the series, and when I show it to my girlfriend that she like the first episode, and the village itself, so we are going to the village for our honeymoon that it will be an experience, and a venture to witness a very good series, and to be where they film it...",5,Better than LOST,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,763,"['remember', 'watching', 'series', 'orginally', 'when', 'was', 'aired', 'father', 'then', 'shown', 'again', 'PBS', 'really', 'love', 'series', 'wishing', 'go', 'place', 'where', 'film', 'episode', 'ask', 'questions', 'favorite', 'ABC', 'General', 'Then', 'purchased', 'VHS', 'set', 'not', 'knowing', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'DVD', 'bought', 'DVD', 'set', '40th', 'anniversary', 'set', 'extra', 'features', 'map', 'village', 'triva', 'questions', 'etc', 'Very', 'much', 'series', 'when', 'show', 'girlfriend', 'first', 'episode', 'village', 'are', 'going', 'village', 'honeymoon', 'will', 'be', 'experience', 'venture', 'witness', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'be', 'where', 'film']",N/A

In fact I think it looks good on my 61"" Sony and Sony DVD.I started watching the Prisoner when it first released in the US as summer replacement. I have been hooked ever since.Yes it is about a spy or ""Secret Agent"" who resigns in obvious disgust and is kidnapped, taken to a very mysterious, secret and very secure place known as ""The Village"". It is also about his attempts at escape and other intrigues. Leading edge spy stuff for its time.To appreciate The Prisoner you must go beneath the surface at what The Prisoner really means. The series is full of symbolism and social commentary while The Vilage is referred to as ""The model for a new world order"" by one of the constantly changing #2's.The series blew everyones mind in the late 60's when it aired. I knew many people who could not get it and never watched more than one or two episodes. The die-hard fans hung in there and got our own minds blown in ""Fall Out"" the final episode.After years and careful noticeof the world and politics and social upheavals The Prisoner now makes sense immediately to people who are just now seeing it for the first time - like my 22 year old daughter. she had it figured out (correctly) by the 3rd DVD.Anyway, this is an important series and TV's first true masterpiece. It is a work or art, it is a social commentary and it is very prophetic and more relevant than ever.I love this set. I enjoyed the bonus tracks. To those who think the bonus tracks are lacking, remember this is a TV show produced in 1967. This is a veritable gold mine of bonus material.After seeing all 17 episodes again in order, sharing them with my daughter had brought me to even new revelations about the series and the genius behind them.My daughter thinks the special effects and action sequences are not realistic - BUT be reminded again, this is a TV series from 1967.Could The Prisoner be remade and updated? Perhaps, but I would have a fear of losing the message. This series was created in an era of relative innocence when most people trusted the government. This is one of the things thsat made the series so remarkable.Here we are 37 years after production and we are STILL discussing it;s significance. While I might agree with my daughter that modern production values and updated special effects woulc be a good spice to the series I would fear destroying the essence and the uniqueness.Mc Goohan had a degree of freedom when producing the series. Any newer production would most likely be polluted by attempts to make it more mass-market acceptable.The Prisoner is a sensitive work and a work of genius.  Buy the DVD set and enjoy.",5,A must for Prisoner fans,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,2673,"['did', 'not', 'think', 'transfer', 'was', 'bad', 'fact', 'think', 'good', '61', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'DVD.I', 'started', 'watching', 'Prisoner', 'when', 'first', 'released', 'US', 'summer', 'replacement', 'have', 'been', 'hooked', 'ever', 'since.Yes', 'spy', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'who', 'resigns', 'obvious', 'disgust', 'kidnapped', 'taken', 'very', 'mysterious', 'secret', 'very', 'secure', 'place', 'known', 'Village', 'also', 'attempts', 'escape', 'other', 'intrigues', 'Leading', 'edge', 'spy', 'stuff', 'time.To', 'appreciate', 'Prisoner', 'must', 'go', 'surface', 'what', 'Prisoner', 'really', 'series', 'full', 'symbolism', 'social', 'commentary', 'Vilage', 'referred', 'model', 'new', 'world', 'order', 'one', 'constantly', 'changing', ""2's.The"", 'series', 'blew', 'everyones', 'mind', 'late', '60', 'when', 'aired', 'knew', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'never', 'watched', 'more', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'hung', 'got', 'own', 'minds', 'blown', 'Fall', 'Out', 'final', 'episode.After', 'years', 'careful', 'world', 'politics', 'social', 'upheavals', 'Prisoner', 'now', 'sense', 'immediately', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'now', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', '22', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'correctly', '3rd', 'DVD.Anyway', 'important', 'series', 'TV', 'first', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'work', 'art', 'social', 'commentary', 'very', 'prophetic', 'more', 'relevant', 'ever.I', 'love', 'set', 'enjoyed', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'who', 'think', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'are', 'lacking', 'remember', 'TV', 'show', 'produced', '1967', 'veritable', 'gold', 'mine', 'bonus', 'material.After', 'seeing', '17', 'episodes', 'again', 'order', 'sharing', 'daughter', 'had', 'brought', 'even', 'new', 'revelations', 'series', 'genius', 'them.My', 'daughter', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'realistic', 'BUT', 'be', 'reminded', 'again', 'TV', 'series', '1967.Could', 'Prisoner', 'be', 'remade', 'updated', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'fear', 'losing', 'message', 'series', 'was', 'created', 'era', 'relative', 'innocence', 'when', 'most', 'people', 'trusted', 'government', 'one', 'things', 'made', 'series', 'so', 'remarkable.Here', 'are', '37', 'years', 'production', 'are', 'STILL', 'discussing', 's', 'significance', 'might', 'agree', 'daughter', 'modern', 'production', 'values', 'updated', 'special', 'effects', 'woulc', 'be', 'good', 'spice', 'series', 'would', 'fear', 'destroying', 'essence', 'uniqueness.Mc', 'Goohan', 'had', 'degree', 'freedom', 'when', 'producing', 'series', 'newer', 'production', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'polluted', 'attempts', 'make', 'more', 'mass-market', 'acceptable.The', 'Prisoner', 'sensitive', 'work', 'work', 'genius', 'Buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'enjoy']",N/A
668758,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00005NKCQ,Allan M. Lees,"[5, 18]","The Prisoner series is unique insofar as it combined a compellingly intense actor with an intriguing concept and some for-the-time very special effects.  As other reviewers have provided synopses of the storyline I'll simply focus on the good and the bad in these stories.First the good: though the sixties motifs seem now rather silly and trite they add to the overall ambience. The Village (actually Portmerion in Wales) is both jolly and sinister at one and the same time, visually appealing while being small enough to induce claustrophobia fairly quickly.  The exploration of society as a prison for the individual is several times touched upon but never really developed.  Our hero Number 6 is a lone wolf but it is in fact perfectly valid to ask where such lone wolves really fit into a society that works only on the basis of cooperation and some degree of mutual trust.  This society, however, is rotten to the core and that's another sixties theme that hasn't really worn the test of time.The first half-dozen episodes are nevertheless very entertaining and we watch the newly arrived Prisoner attempting first to escape and then gradually settling down to a life of pacing his cage and resisting where he can.Unfortunately, the plot lines are at best highly implausible and at worst downright risible and there are enough loose ends that you'd go mad trying to look for logic or consistency.  Even the dialog is frequently tired, saved only by McGoohan's intense delivery and hypnotic screen presence.  Worst of all, the team clearly had no idea where to take the series nor how to end it.  The final half-dozen or so episodes are embarrassing in the extreme and the Grand Finale is really just a tedious exposure of McGoohan's utter inability to rise to the occasion.  It's really best to watch just the first six or eight episodes and then imagine for yourself what could have been, rather than watch the painful reality of what was done with the series.If the rights were available there's enough good ideas in this old TV series for one really good 150-minute motion picture, perhaps starring a really compelling actor-with-an-edge like Daniel Craig.  But it would need competent script writing and a sense of where to go, both of which are catastrophically lacking from this 17-episode set.",3,No Way Out,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,2306,"['Prisoner', 'series', 'unique', 'insofar', 'combined', 'compellingly', 'intense', 'actor', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'for-the-time', 'very', 'special', 'effects', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'provided', 'synopses', 'storyline', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'focus', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'sixties', 'motifs', 'seem', 'now', 'rather', 'silly', 'trite', 'add', 'overall', 'ambience', 'Village', 'actually', 'Portmerion', 'Wales', 'jolly', 'sinister', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'visually', 'appealing', 'being', 'small', 'enough', 'induce', 'claustrophobia', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'exploration', 'society', 'prison', 'individual', 'several', 'times', 'touched', 'never', 'really', 'developed', 'hero', 'Number', '6', 'lone', 'wolf', 'fact', 'perfectly', 'valid', 'ask', 'where', 'such', 'lone', 'wolves', 'really', 'fit', 'society', 'only', 'basis', 'cooperation', 'degree', 'mutual', 'trust', 'society', 'however', 'rotten', 'core', 'sixties', 'theme', ""n't"", 'really', 'worn', 'test', 'time.The', 'first', 'half-dozen', 'episodes', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'newly', 'arrived', 'Prisoner', 'attempting', 'first', 'escape', 'then', 'gradually', 'settling', 'down', 'life', 'pacing', 'cage', 'resisting', 'where', 'can.Unfortunately', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'best', 'highly', 'implausible', 'worst', 'downright', 'risible', 'are', 'enough', 'loose', 'ends', ""'d"", 'go', 'mad', 'trying', 'look', 'logic', 'consistency', 'Even', 'dialog', 'frequently', 'tired', 'saved', 'only', 'McGoohan', 'intense', 'delivery', 'hypnotic', 'screen', 'presence', 'Worst', 'team', 'clearly', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'take', 'series', 'how', 'end', 'final', 'half-dozen', 'so', 'episodes', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'extreme', 'Grand', 'Finale', 'really', 'just', 'tedious', 'exposure', 'McGoohan', 'utter', 'inability', 'rise', 'occasion', 'really', 'best', 'watch', 'just', 'first', 'six', 'eight', 'episodes', 'then', 'imagine', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'watch', 'painful', 'reality', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'series.If', 'rights', 'were', 'available', 'enough', 'good', 'ideas', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'one', 'really', 'good', '150-minute', 'motion', 'picture', 'perhaps', 'starring', 'really', 'compelling', 'actor-with-an-edge', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'would', 'need', 'competent', 'script', 'writing', 'sense', 'where', 'go', 'are', 'catastrophically', 'lacking', '17-episode', 'set']",N/A

668766,AJ57K3QG32CNK,B00005NKCQ,Avant-Captain_Nemo,"[55, 61]","There are no greater television shows than ""The Prisoner"".  Not ever.  Perhaps shows such as ""MASH"" or ""Twin Peaks"" rise high enough to catch a glimpse of Patrick McGoohan's Big Idea racing off into the distance but they will never catch up.  ""The Prisoner"" is one of the few works of art in the twentieth century that actually deserve to be called revolutionary.  But, Patrick McGoohan, the show's creator and star, has no time whatsoever to rebel against things that lesser figures and would-be rebels wish to rebel against -stoking up the fires of their tiny egos.  McGoohan means business and his series, ""The Prisoner"" rushes up to all of the Big Questions and grabs them by the neck.  ""The Prisoner"" is a declared war against tyranny in all of its forms: sexual attraction, the lure of comfort, the facade of democratic politics, science, fundamentalist anti-science, conservatism, cheap liberal progressivism, group-think in any form at all including ""individualism"" (which is just another form of group-think),the ultimate prison which is one's self, and more.  Number Six, played by Patrick McGoohan himself, is absolutely relentless on his assault upon the Village which would keep him there against his will.  And he desires to leave no matter what wholesome blandishments are offered to him.  In that way, Number Six is a greater human being than most of us.  He is more than a common human individual living out his life.  He is an archetype.  He can never quite escape but the octopoidal snares of the Village can never quite hold him.  In that way, his story resembles the myth of Sisyphus.  And yet Number Six is more than Sisyphus.  I will not give the end of the series away but I will say that at the end Number Six comes to a true understanding of himself.  The only good true understanding of one's self is if that understanding destroys the cycles.  The strangest idea at the base of ""The Prisoner"" is the idea that morality itself, at its most secret heart, is the ultimate form of rebellion.  Number Six has a devotion to pure justice, profound freedom, actual compassion ( as opposed to its sentimental counterfeits), and rigorous truth telling that is so extreme - more extreme even than the great Jewish prophets in the Bible - that he actually is an archetype, and not merely a single human being.  Number One is the secret Archon that rules the Village.  The Village is, of course, demon possessed, though the demons mostly reveal themselves as Angels of Light.  Under Number One is paraded a grand series of Number Two's.  They come and they go.  Each one of them is yet one more attempt to seduce or brutalize Number Six into giving up his freedom.  One of the strangest things about this series is that Patrick McGoohan's idea of freedom rejects both the dionysian and the apollonian as categories of human thought and endeavour.  McGoohan believes there is a third way that carves its own path, disdainful of the sharp and controlled, fascist geometries of the apollonian and compassionately rejectfull of the oblivion and disintegration offered by the dionysian.

668769,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00005NKCQ,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[2, 2]","Unique, wildly unconventional, often frustrating, but never dull, Patrick McGoohan's brilliant 17-episode original series, ""The Prisoner"" has stirred controversy for over 40 years. Was it a nightmarish vision of dehumanization? A bitter treatise on the loss of personal freedom to 'the System'? A satire of an era when vocal radicals were undermining the Establishment? Or something else, entirely? One of the pleasures of the series is creating your own theory (which McGoohan, himself, encouraged), and this collection provides everything you need to become an expert on the world of 'The Village'...It is a program with an intriguing backstory; after 86 spisodes playing 'John Drake' in the very popular British series, ""Danger Man"" (renamed ""Secret Agent"" in America), between 1961-1967, McGoohan abruptly quit. When the studio demanded compensation, he offered a new series, about a secret agent who leaves the service for personal reasons, is promptly kidnapped, imprisoned in an idyllic, but sterile community, renamed 'Number 6', and relentlessly interrogated by the unknown jailers. Each week he'd attempt to escape, only to be recaptured, until he'd finally learn the secret behind 'The Village'. The studio, intrigued by the concept (recognizing the parallels to McGoohan's own situation), asked for 26 episodes (McGoohan wanted to make only seven), and a compromise of 17 episodes was reached. Then the American distributor, CBS, became involved; they disliked the concept (believing it to be little more than a live-action 'Road Runner' cartoon, with McGoohan's character the coyote, devising elaborate schemes to escape that always failed), and dumped the new show into the little-viewed summer 'hiatus' between seasons, where failed pilots and unsuccessful series could earn back production costs by advertising revenue.But a strange thing happened; ratings soared, as word-of-mouth about the unconventional series spread, and CBS found itself with a hit! They quickly approached McGoohan, begging him to extend the series, and offering a prime spot in the fall TV schedule. The actor simply smiled, said, ""Thanks, but no thanks!"", and concluded ""The Prisoner"" with the surreal 17th episode.And the legend was born...Loaded with extras, including trivia quizzes, a 'Video Companion' to the series, production stills, and even a map of 'The Village', ""The Prisoner - Complete Series Megaset (40th Anniversary Edition)"" is the most comprehensive edition of the groundbreaking series you will ever find...I highly recommend it, and invite you to join Number 6 in the Village...and develop your own theories!",5,Patrick McGoohan's Unconventional Classic!,1238889600,"04 5, 2009",2009,2619,"['Unique', 'wildly', 'unconventional', 'often', 'frustrating', 'never', 'dull', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'brilliant', '17-episode', 'original', 'series', 'Prisoner', 'stirred', 'controversy', '40', 'years', 'Was', 'nightmarish', 'vision', 'dehumanization', 'bitter', 'treatise', 'loss', 'personal', 'freedom', ""'the"", 'System', 'satire', 'era', 'when', 'vocal', 'radicals', 'were', 'undermining', 'Establishment', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'One', 'pleasures', 'series', 'creating', 'own', 'theory', 'McGoohan', 'encouraged', 'collection', 'everything', 'need', 'become', 'expert', 'world', ""'The"", 'Village', 'program', 'intriguing', 'backstory', '86', 'spisodes', 'playing', ""'John"", 'Drake', 'very', 'popular', 'British', 'series', 'Danger', 'Man', 'renamed', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'America', '1961-1967', 'McGoohan', 'abruptly', 'quit', 'When', 'studio', 'demanded', 'compensation', 'offered', 'new', 'series', 'secret', 'agent', 'who', 'service', 'personal', 'reasons', 'promptly', 'kidnapped', 'imprisoned', 'idyllic', 'sterile', 'community', 'renamed', '6', 'relentlessly', 'interrogated', 'unknown', 'jailers', 'week', ""'d"", 'attempt', 'escape', 'only', 'be', 'recaptured', ""'d"", 'finally', 'learn', 'secret', ""'The"", 'Village', 'studio', 'intrigued', 'concept', 'recognizing', 'parallels', 'McGoohan', 'own', 'situation', 'asked', '26', 'episodes', 'McGoohan', 'wanted', 'make', 'only', 'seven', 'compromise', '17', 'episodes', 'was', 'reached', 'Then', 'American', 'distributor', 'CBS', 'became', 'involved', 'disliked', 'concept', 'believing', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'live-action', ""'Road"", 'Runner', 'cartoon', 'McGoohan', 'character', 'coyote', 'devising', 'elaborate', 'schemes', 'escape', 'always', 'failed', 'dumped', 'new', 'show', 'little-viewed', 'summer', 'seasons', 'where', 'failed', 'pilots', 'unsuccessful', 'series', 'could', 'earn', 'back', 'production', 'costs', 'advertising', 'revenue.But', 'strange', 'thing', 'happened', 'ratings', 'soared', 'word-of-mouth', 'unconventional', 'series', 'spread', 'CBS', 'found', 'hit', 'quickly', 'approached', 'McGoohan', 'begging', 'extend', 'series', 'offering', 'prime', 'spot', 'fall', 'TV', 'schedule', 'actor', 'simply', 'smiled', 'said', 'Thanks', 'thanks', 'concluded', 'Prisoner', 'surreal', '17th', 'legend', 'was', 'born', 'Loaded', 'extras', 'including', 'trivia', 'quizzes', ""'Video"", 'Companion', 'series', 'production', 'stills', 'even', 'map', ""'The"", 'Village', 'Prisoner', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Megaset', '40th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'most', 'comprehensive', 'edition', 'groundbreaking', 'series', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'highly', 'recommend', 'invite', 'join', 'Number', '6', 'Village', 'develop', 'own', 'theories']",N/A

I only saw reruns as I was in Viet Nam at the time. Makes you wonder what they did with the Blu-ray treatment. They do have a voice over commentary which was made before the Blu-ray treatment greatly adds to the viewing.Patrick McGoohan plays a government agent was decided to resign his job. Evidently someone is interested in the real reason why he decided to resign his job. Therefore he is shuffled off to a mysterious place called the village.Each episode is identical to the previous episode and is identical to the next episode. They do have different writers but the same formula. As with all TV programs key actors get to be guests on individual episodes. Each episode a situation is set up new people are introduced with problems and ""number six"" (Patrick McGoohan the prisoner) must decide whether the new person is a friend or foe and his every episode attempt to escape the village. I don't know if it has the same meaning in England as it does in the US, however the primary visible bad guy is always number two.Even though each episode is repetitive it is fun to wait and see which actors will appear on the individual episodes. I was really surprised to see that many of the actors are the same ones that appear on the Dorothy L Sayers Lord Peter Wimsey series of television programs.Without giving too much away the village was filmed at Portmeirion, Gwynedd, (North West) Wales, UK. 300 miles away from London.

668772,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B00005NKCQ,B. Martin,"[18, 58]","I will admit that I never knew much about this highly regarded and supposedly influential series until after I finished watching the final season of Lost.  While readiing viewer responses to the finale of that series, I was drawn to repeated references to The Prisoner and how it was ahead of its time and misunderstood by audiences at the time.  Further inquiries about this series revealed that it did, in fact, have a major influence on some of my favorites television series including The X-Files and the aforementioned Lost.  I was definitely looking forward to immersing myself in a show that was not only mentioned in the same breath as some of my all time favorites, but also blazed a path for them.Sadly, I found The Prisoner to be a colassal disappointment.  It is a series, that in my opinion, tosses out big, important sounding themes, but never really goes anywhere interesting with them.  I watched the entire series because I wanted to make sure that I didn't miss anything, but if this series were airing today, I seriously doubt that I would stick with it for more than 2 or 3 episodes.The series follows a former British spy (Patrick McGoohan) who, following his resignation, is knocked uncoscious and taken to a seemingly utopian location known as The Village.  His new home appears to be a perfect and blissful resort but it is actually a prison where everyone is assigned a number and is monitored constantly.  McGoohan's character is known as Number 6 and it turns out that he has been brought to The Village in an attempt to extract the classified information that he still has in head as well as to determine why he resigned from his job in the first place.Each of the 17 episodes in the series follows the same premise.  Number 6 fights to hold onto his identity and sanity as well as his individuality despite repeated attempts by the leader of The Village, Number 2 (a position that is held by a revolving series of individuals) to break his will and unlock his secrets.  Mind games are played but Number 6 always manages to outwit his captors.As I mentioned earlier, there are larger themes at work here.  The Prisoner tosses around ideas such as conformity, the individual vs. society, paranoia, free will, identity, etc.  All of this sounds very impressive and brainy, but is actually quite dull.  Perhpas its because the show is so preoccupied with how smart and complex it is, that it becomes cold and detached.  Maybe it's because there are no characters that the audience can invest in.  Or maybe it's simply because nothing makes any sense throughout the entire series.  The show starts out fairly incoherent and difficult to follow, and by the end has devolved into an indecipherable mess.  At times the episodes can feel like Monty Python skits that are trying to be serious.I understand that The Prisoner is intended to be a puzzle with multiple layers and interpretations that viewers are supposed to return to in order to sort out what it all means.  I respect that, but I just don't think it succeeded.  I don't think that just because something doesn't make sense that it is deep and profound.......it just means that it doesn't make sense.  That would have been fine with me if The Prisoner had been even remotely engaging and entertaining.

The only drawback is the price which is over the top.I became a fan of this show when it first came out in the 60s for an entirely different set of reasons than I have now for considering it a masterpiece (or very close to). The concept of being held under constant surveillance by the powers that be was something unheard of for the television media back then and, other than Orwell's great work, something the media has generally never shown any particular interest in. That's not entirely surprising considering the chief purveyors of political and corporate disINFORMATION are so closely tied to today's media. A series of this sort will never see the light of day again (sans the manipulative twisted social agenda of the western media) and there is very good reason for that. No old boys club is going to point the finger of blame at itself for creating a perverted and obscene society.There are those who absolutely hate this series and in some ways that's understandable as well. The main character is not a thoroughly likeable one and has a tendency to come across as smugly self-assured. That can be irritating and, as today's viewing public is convinced their heroes should portray a perfect balance of society's most cherished misconceptions, it's not surprising some will be unable to appreciate number six's unique character traits. They are however essential for carrying the series' winding plot to it's inevitable if somewhat bizarrely choreographed conclusion. Not everyone deserving of autonomy has Mel Gibson's unassuming manner and the Village authority (much the same as the power elite today) has absolutely no tolerance for number 6's unique and dangerous blend of:1) youthful rebellion against any accepted norm2) the audacity of an established/successful member of the establishment biting the hand that feeds it.With regard to social relevance this show was far ahead of it's own or even today's mass mindset. If you are looking for a high tech action thriller that spells out the plot and subplots this isn't something you will enjoy. If you appreciate a unique brainteaser artfully and entertainingly mixed with action, drama and social commentary this one is essential viewing.Mission Impossible it ain't and we can all be very thankful for that!SM",4,Mission Impossible it ain't!,1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,2377,"['question', 'be', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'socially', 'relevant', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'only', 'drawback', 'price', 'top.I', 'became', 'fan', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '60s', 'entirely', 'different', 'set', 'reasons', 'have', 'now', 'considering', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'close', 'concept', 'being', 'held', 'constant', 'surveillance', 'powers', 'be', 'was', 'something', 'unheard', 'television', 'media', 'back', 'then', 'other', 'Orwell', 'great', 'work', 'something', 'media', 'generally', 'never', 'shown', 'particular', 'interest', 'not', 'entirely', 'surprising', 'considering', 'chief', 'purveyors', 'political', 'corporate', 'disINFORMATION', 'are', 'so', 'closely', 'tied', 'today', 'media', 'series', 'sort', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'again', 'manipulative', 'twisted', 'social', 'agenda', 'western', 'media', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'old', 'boys', 'club', 'going', 'point', 'finger', 'blame', 'creating', 'perverted', 'obscene', 'society.There', 'are', 'who', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'series', 'ways', 'understandable', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'thoroughly', 'likeable', 'one', 'tendency', 'come', 'smugly', 'self-assured', 'can', 'be', 'irritating', 'today', 'viewing', 'public', 'convinced', 'heroes', 'should', 'portray', 'perfect', 'balance', 'society', 'most', 'cherished', 'misconceptions', 'not', 'surprising', 'will', 'be', 'unable', 'appreciate', 'number', 'six', 'unique', 'character', 'traits', 'are', 'however', 'essential', 'carrying', 'series', 'winding', 'plot', 'inevitable', 'somewhat', 'bizarrely', 'choreographed', 'conclusion', 'Not', 'everyone', 'deserving', 'autonomy', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'unassuming', 'manner', 'Village', 'authority', 'much', 'same', 'power', 'elite', 'today', 'absolutely', 'tolerance', 'number', '6', 'unique', 'dangerous', 'blend', 'of:1', 'youthful', 'rebellion', 'accepted', 'norm2', 'audacity', 'established/successful', 'member', 'establishment', 'biting', 'hand', 'it.With', 'regard', 'social', 'relevance', 'show', 'was', 'far', 'ahead', 'own', 'even', 'today', 'mass', 'mindset', 'are', 'looking', 'high', 'tech', 'action', 'thriller', 'out', 'plot', 'subplots', ""n't"", 'something', 'will', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'unique', 'brainteaser', 'artfully', 'entertainingly', 'mixed', 'action', 'drama', 'social', 'commentary', 'one', 'essential', 'viewing.Mission', 'Impossible', 'ai', ""n't"", 'can', 'be', 'very', 'thankful', 'SM']",N/A

Fall OutAlthough it is true that there is no official or established order in which The Prisoner episodes are meant to be viewed, there are many instances of narrative connective tissue linking them together in interesting ways.  Some of this connective tissue is admittedly tenuous, while other strands are wire-tight.  My own approach to organizing the episodes is quite similar to the way they are presented in this box set, just with a few noteworthy alterations.There are only three episodes that no one debates over where they fall in the grand scheme of things: episodes one, sixteen and seventeen, or ""Arrival"", ""Once Upon a Time"", and ""Fall Out.""  Everything else is, ultimately, for better or worse, open to interpretation.My system for arranging the episodes focuses on the evolution of No. 6 - aka the titular ""Prisoner"" - from victim to victor, captive to captain, anvil to hammer.The first set of episodes (""Arrival"" through ""Dance Of the Dead"") center around 6's various stymied attempts to escape from the bizarre and sequestered prison-community known as ""The Village"".  He is absolutely fixated on finding a way out of The Village in each of these stories, but fails bitterly each time.Second group (""The General"" through ""Many Happy Returns"") finds No. 6 a bit more settled in, less preoccupied with fleeing, and more busy fending off the most aggressive No. 2s yet.  After making his great escape in ""Many Happy Returns"", only to find himself back in The Village only days later, he does not make another serious attempt until the final installment, ""Fall Out.""  Also, there are solid narrative threads that tell us these four episodes go right next to each other in the order I describe.The third batch (""Funeral"" through ""Forsake"") finds TP increasingly interested in, and eminently capable of, turning the tables on his oppressors.  This trend began in earnest with ""A., B., & C."", and continues full-steam ahead here.  The No. 2s suffer their most humiliating defeats thus far in the series.The final group, which is by far the most surrealistic and psychedelic, finds The Prisoner dominating his enemies, even as they take their most drastic mind-altering measures to shake his sense of self and sanity.As I noted earlier, no one debates that ""Arrival"" is episode one.  I place ""Free For All"" second, primarily because numerous mentions are made of 6 still being new to The Village, and his nemeses - the villainous No. 2s - are still easily able to flummox him and foil his escape attempts.""Checkmate"" comes third because our boy is still clearly learning the ropes at The Village, and is once again easily deflated and defeated when he tries to make a run.  What's more, there is a direct reference made to ""Free For All,"" which makes this a nice shoe-in for the number three slot.  Also, in ""Free For All"", 6 declared his intention to learn which Villagers are prisoners and which ones are jailors.  He spends the entire the episode of ""Checkmate"" doing just that.""Chimes"" is next for me because, once again, No. 6 winds up humiliated and dejected after making his most ambitious escape-attempt yet.  This time he actually got out of The Village (or did he?), but was quickly roped back in.  He's still making the mistake of trusting other Villagers, and is still not savvy enough to his oppressors' methods.  ""Chimes"" would also be a fine choice for fifth episode, if switched with ""Dance Of the Dead.""""Dance"" is yet another episode ending in decisive defeat for the Prisoner.  I place this one fifth instead of fourth mainly because it introduces the possible notion that The Village's top dog - i.e. No. 1 - might in fact be a machine of some sort, a possibility further explored in the following episode.  I'm still kinda debating whether this should be fourth or fifth.""The General.""  Now here is where I part ways with this box set's episode-order in a big way.  If there are any two middle episodes that I am absolutely certain go together, it is ""The General"" and ""A., B., & C."", and in that specific order.  But this set has it reversed - ""A."" before ""General"", which is a surprising oversight.OK, so I haven't explained this yet, but every installment of The Prisoner features a new villain-figure called ""No. 2"", whose job it is to break The Prisoner's rebellious spirit and extract his classified secrets.  Should they fail - and they always do - they are replaced with another individual who takes on the mantle of No. 2.So.  These two episodes (""The General"" and ""A., B. & C."") feature the same No. 2, which tells us for certain that they are meant to be viewed consecutively, leaving only the question of which comes first.  And yet as easily as this question is answered, this DVD edition somehow manages to reverse the correct order!See, in ""The General"", No. 2 is cool, confident, and unusually detached.  He's not making much of an effort really, and No. 6's main struggle is with a figure known as ""The General"", not with No. 2.Now ""A., B., & C."" opens with the previously cool and collected No. 2 quaking with anxiety, shaking in his boots for fear that he is about to be replaced.  After 2's desperate effort to break 6 is foiled, he finally receives the dreaded phone call from his displeased superior during the episode's final seconds.So...""A."" clearly follows ""The General"", right?  And here's MORE evidence.  Each program of THE PRISONER begins with a similar sequence in which 6 shouts, ""Who are you?"", to which the latest No. 2 replies, ""I am THE NEW No. 2.""  BUT.... This sequence is uniquely revised in ""A., B. & C."" when 2 simply replies, ""I am No. 2"", leaving out ""the new"" because this is in fact his second appearance in a row.  ""A."" is clearly meant to follow ""The General.""Now ""The Schizoid Man"" comes next because dates are given in both ""A."" and ""Schizoid"" which place the one coming directly after the other.  These aforementioned dates are visible on editions of The Village newspaper, ""The Tally Ho"", and actually end up providing still MORE evidence that ""A."" must  follow ""General"", and not the other way around.Specific dates also place ""Many Happy Returns"" right after ""Schizoid.""  ""Many"" is also the final story in which 6 makes a foiled getaway run.  It was his most ambitious and successful effort yet (he made it all the way back home!), which only made the eventual defeat all the more spirit-crushing.""It's Your Funeral"" comes next, and is the first story in which No. 6's goal is something other than getting out of The Village.  It is also the second episode in a row to feature the game Kosho, an extremely odd combat-sport invented by McGoohan himself.The next slew of shows feature No. 6 handing each new No. 2 his own head on a proverbial platter.  No longer interested in fleeing The Village, 6 now devotes his energy to resisting his enemies, and doling out one defeat after the next.  In Nietzsche's terms, The Prisoner is becoming The Monster in order to defeat The Monster.All of which culminates in ""Once Upon A Time,"" in which 6 actually KILLS (or believes he kills?) a No. 2.  This particular 2 also has the distinction of being the only one summoned back from a previous episode (I believe he was originally in ""Chimes""?  That may be wrong.) (Oh, also, the No. 2 from ""General"" and ""A., B., & C"" doesn't count, because he never really left).Episodes 13 through 15 (""Do Not Forsake"" through The Girl"") are unified in that none of the stories take place - or at least none of them SEEM to take place - in The Village, which has been the signature setting for the show thus far.  These episodes each have a uniquely experimental bent (one is a Western [!], the other two bizarre espionage/spy yarns), and directly foreshadow themes, characters, and settings that will dominate the final two-part story of ""Once Upon A Time"" and ""Fall Out.""Speaking of ""Fall Out"", would you like to hear my detailed interpretation of the meaning behind it all?  Didn't think so.  But I will say that I DO have an impressively coherent and unified theory about The Prisoner, and it involves - among other things - The Village cloning special agents for their own nebulous/nefarious purposes.  Various undeniable instances of cloned characters - or at least characters who somehow have identical doubles - can be observed throughout the series, most frequently with No. 2s.Oh, and ***SPOILER ALERT***It should also be noted that there were constant suggestions all along that No. 6 was No. 1.  The most notable (and notably overlooked) example is during the opening sequence when 6 asks 2, ""Who Is Number 1?"", to which 2 replies, ""You are Number 6.""  In other words, ""You, Number 1, are Number 6.""  2's reply could also be interpreted as, ""You are, Number 6"" i.e. ""You are Number 1, Number 6.""  Various No. 2s also made allusions to 6 being 1 throughout the series, especially in the first batch.***SPOILER ALERT OVER***So there you have it.  And for the record, the show and this deluxe box set get a solid 5-star vote from me.B Cing U",5,A Prisoner Geek's Suggested Epsiode-Order List,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,9336,"['1', 'Arrival2',

668778,ACC1SLND21RI6,B00005NKCQ,Breyel,"[4, 7]","Ditto what other reviewers have said about ""The Prisoner - Complete Series Megaset (40 Anniversary Edition)"". The DVD set offered by A&E; is EXCELLENT, especially the supporting materials, e.g. 60-page booklet, map, the alternative intro/outro versions, promotional trailers and episode variation of ""The Chimes of Big Ben"".  The series itself is imaginative, well acted and thoughtfully articulated. It is indeed one of the finest sci-fi/fantasy TV series to emerge in the late 60's.The central theme of an Everyman (Patrick McGoohan) versus the Establishment (the Village keepers) is in keeping with the 60's era, yet it has a way of transcending it. Nearly 40 years on, it is plausible to see similarities even in society today - surveillance cameras, orange alert, etc.Perhaps it was a vehicle for McGoohan to critique the intrusiveness of government, bureaucracy, corporations, mass media, science and how they impinge upon and manipulate the personal choices of the individual. Or, more fantastically, it was all a surrealistic dream world imagined by a spy seeking a holiday, but never able to escape the paranoia, the delusions in his mind. Or, it was actually McGoohan and creative collaborator George Markstein's way of exorcising their typecast image ofSecret Agent (aka Danger Man) - The Complete Collection Megaset 2007,  as some reviewers have suggested.Does The Prisoner escape? In a physical sense he does leave the Village in the end. But, the show ends the way it began -- McGoohan speeding along in his Lotus Super 7 -- suggesting other trials are ahead, just as formidable and nearly inescapable. Who was No. 1? Why it was The Prisoner himself. Again, this suggests one can never best or entirely escape oneself. The Prisoner works at many levels, and this is why it is a brilliant classic.Whatever one's fascination is for ""The Prisoner"", I for one am delighted to finally have this A&E; Anniversary Edition in my DVD library, although it is a tad bit pricey. I have been mesmerised by this series since the summer of 1968 when as a young teen I watched it, not particularly understanding its subtlety, but just drawn to McGoohan's character. Fast-forward nearly four decades, and I see it today for all its symbolism and am all the more amazed by McGoohan's genius.That said,  I heartily recommend ""The Prisoner - Complete Series Megaset (40 Anniversary Edition)"", as opposed to the individual episodes.

668779,A3SJ2VSCHZB18,B00005NKCQ,Brian Markowski,"[11, 13]","It's 1960's London  and a secret agent resigns from his post. While packing to leave England, knock out gas fills his apartment and our now ex-agent passes out. He wakes up in the Village, a sort of forced retirement community for ex-spies. And so begins most every episode of this 10 DVD set of the classic TV show ""The Prisoner"".This British import from 1967 was  conceived by Patrick McGoohan, star of another British show called Danger Man /Secret Agent. Though ""The Prisoner"" is not meant to be a squeal to Danger Man it does offer tantalizing clues that suggest otherwise, but this is just part of the fun offered by this cult classic.In ""The Prisoner"" our protagonist is assigned a number and is hen force never referred to as anything else but ""Number 6"". Most episodes, there are 17 of them, has Number 2, head of the Village, trying to interrogate Number 6 as to why he resigned. Some of these interrogations are rather elaborate often leading to a game of cat and mouse between 6 and 2. Number 6 tries to escape the Village regularly as well, but just as Number 2 is never able to deduce Number 6's reasons for resigning, Number 2 is never really able is escape.  Or is he?Hence the sublime beauty of this show, often this series plays out like a typical spy thriller but a good number of the shows are interlaced with abstract themes, like the too dominate role of technology in society.  McGoohan personally thought that technology was evolving too rapidly and adopted the image of a penny farthing bicycle into the Village as a reminder for us all to slow down. The last two episodes, surreal to the point of madness, deal almost exclusively with the duality of man. McGoohan seems to suggest that  we are doomed to resort to our primitive nature over reason when backed against the wall.So does Number 6 escape? Who is Number 1? Where is the Village? If this were a typical show the answers would be definite, yes, no, or we never find out, but ""The Prisoner"" is no ordinary show. It's safe so say that Number 6 does and does not escape. That we meet and do not meet Number 1 and that the Village may or may not be in a number of different locations. Confusing? Yes quite often it is, but no other TV shows out there, past or present took the chances that ""The Prisoner"" did way back in the 1960's.The DVD has plenty of extra's that try to help understand the show better. An interview with Production Manager Bernie Williams sheds a lot of light on the production process of ""The Prisoner"". We also get a nice short that addresses some of the more maddening questions of the show. There are lot's of trivia questions and stills as well. The extra's are quite light however for a box set that cost so much and to make matters worst all are about 10 years old. There is little that is fresh here.

668780,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,B00005NKCQ,Brian Overland,"[7, 7]","This is a complete set of actor/producer/director/writer Patrick McGoohan's masterpiece -- a show that went over budget and was poorly understood in the late 60s... but which has since developed a cult following as a sci-fi/fantasy achievement more sophisticated than anything since -- even surpassing Star Trek in its intellectually challenging themes. ""The Prisoner"" surpasses even ""Twilight Zone"" for its mind warping endings. (Best episode in this regard is probably the outstanding ""A, B, and C,"" in which the protagonist's dreams are invaded, yet he finds a way to turn the tables on the invaders!)Most of what follows is an overview of The Prisoner. For details on DVD extras, jump to the last paragraph.""The Prisoner"" starts simply enough. A British intelligence agent (McGoohan) resigns angrily -- something we see in pantomine in the opening credits of every episode -- after which he is kidnapped and wakes up in a mysterious place called ""the Village."" It's a place, charming but isolated, where people are sent who know too much to be allowed to walk away.We don't know whether the Village is run by Us or Them... for in the late 60s, Cold War paranoia was at a high point. If it is being run by Us (the West), the Village masters need to know for sure whether the protagonist (known as ""the Prisoner"" or ""Number 6"") intended to defect. They need INFORMATION.It also might be run by Them: double agents pretending to work for the British but really in league with the Commies. In that case, they want to pick the Prisoner's brain for secrets. Again, they need INFORMATION.The Prisoner, meanwhile, is equally anxious to find out which side really runs the village. No one trusts anyone! At first he wants only to escape... but fairly early on in the series, he declares he wants to ""escape, come back, and wipe this place off the face of the earth.""So much for the premise. Everything above is essentially backdrop for the REAL struggle. As things progress, it becomes more and more apparent that this is an allegorical battle of the individual against society. THEY must break him; HE is determined to repel efforts to get inside his mind......yet even THAT is simplistic! McGoohan was subtle enough to understand that individual and society can't be mutually exclusive. Ultimately, they need each other. Societies need individuals for creativity, innovation, and leadership; individuals living outside of society face at best a brutal existence (a fact the marvelous episode ""Many Happy Returns"" explores). The question finally posed by the series is: can the individual maintain sufficient personal integrity while acknowledging that he/she is fated to be a ""prisoner"" of some society or another? What is the right balance? And so -- episode after episode explore not just the ""spy who must escape"" theme, but attempts by masters of the Village to make prisoners into happy little automatons.McGoohan and his collaborators created a fictional place unique and yet so familiar that it serves to represent the whole world. There's the Control Room, intrusive government spying; the mysterious ""Rover,"" a special effect that hasn't aged and which represents fear wielded by Authority... an enforcer in the form of an ominous white balloon; a mysterious little butler who never says a word, but always stands next to Authority; and the ""Penny Farthing"" bicycle symbol that serves as the Village's logo. Above all, everyone is known not by name but by a number... the Prisoner, or Number 6, has a relatively high number indicating his value to his captors. (He'd surely be given a position of authority if he cooperated.) But the real chairman of the Village is the ever-changing No. 2, who reports to the unseen No. 1, the shadowy uber-authority figure behind it all.DVD Extras:By far the best is the 16mm film on the final disk, showing location shooting at Portmeirion, a famous resort in North Wales. This priceless footage shows the original Rover (a horrible special effect that looks like a giant cupcake with a light on top) before McGoohan ingeniously replaced it with weather balloons. Then there's fascinating commentary on disk 5 with Production Manager Bernie Williams, and the alternate version of ""Chimes of Big Ben"" on disk 1. This alternate version shows the original music, opening credits, and closing credits -- which McGoohan wisely replaced. Still, it's fascinating to see how much the show evolved by constant improvements up till the first airdate.",5,"Never Been Surpassed -- Aren't You a Prisoner, Too?",1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,4482,"['complete', 'set', 'actor/producer/director/writer', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'masterpiece', 'show', 'went', 'budget', 'was', 'poorly', 'understood', 'late', '60s', 'developed', 'cult', 'following', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'achievement', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'anything', 'even', 'surpassing', 'Star', 'Trek', 'intellectually', 'challenging', 'themes', 'Prisoner', 'even', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'mind', 'warping', 'endings', 'Best', 'episode', 'regard', 'probably', 'outstanding', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'protagonist', 'dreams', 'are', 'invaded', 'yet', 'way', 'turn', 'tables', 'invaders', 'Most', 'what', 'overview', 'Prisoner', 'details', 'DVD', 'extras', 'jump', 'last', 'paragraph', 'Prisoner', 'simply', 'enough', 'British', 'intelligence', 'agent', 'McGoohan', 'resigns', 'angrily', 'something', 'see', 'pantomine', 'opening', 'credits', 'episode', 'kidnapped', 'up', 'mysterious', 'place', 'called', 'Village', 'place', 'charming', 'isolated', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'sent', 'who', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'allowed', 'walk', 'away.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Village', 'run', 'Us', 'Them', 'late', '60s', 'Cold', 'War', 'paranoia', 'was', 'high', 'point', 'being', 'run', 'Us', 'West', 'Village', 'masters', 'need', 'know', 'sure', 'protagonist', 'known', 'Prisoner', 'Number', '6', 'intended', 'defect', 'need', 'INFORMATION.It', 'also', 'might', 'be', 'run', 'Them', 'double', 'agents', 'pretending', 'work', 'British', 'really', 'league', 'Commies', 'case', 'want', 'pick', 'Prisoner', 'brain', 'secrets', 'Again', 'need', 'INFORMATION.The', 'Prisoner', 'meanwhile', 'equally', 'anxious', 'find', 'out', 'side', 'really', 'village', 'one', 'anyone', 'first', 'only', 'escape', 'fairly', 'early', 'series', 'escape', 'come', 'back', 'wipe', 'place', 'face', 'earth', 'So', 'much', 'premise', 'Everything', 'essentially', 'backdrop', 'REAL', 'struggle', 'things', 'progress', 'more', 'more', 'apparent', 'allegorical', 'battle', 'individual', 'society', 'THEY', 'must', 'break', 'HE', 'determined', 'repel', 'efforts', 'get', 'mind', 'yet', 'even', 'THAT', 'simplistic', 'McGoohan', 'was', 'subtle', 'enough', 'understand', 'individual', 'society', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'Ultimately', 'need', 'other', 'Societies', 'need', 'individuals', 'creativity', 'innovation', 'leadership', 'individuals', 'living', 'society', 'face', 'best', 'brutal', 'existence', 'fact', 'marvelous', 'episode', 'Many', 'Happy', 'Returns', 'explores', 'question', 'finally', 'posed', 'series', 'can', 'individual', 'maintain', 'sufficient', 'personal', 'integrity', 'acknowledging', 'he/she', 'fated', 'be', 'prisoner', 'society', 'What', 'right', 'balance', 'so', 'episode', 'episode', 'not', 'just', 'spy', 'who', 'must', 'escape', 'theme', 'attempts', 'masters', 'Village', 'make', 'prisoners', 'happy', 'little', 'automatons.McGoohan', 'collaborators', 'created', 'fictional', 'place', 'unique', 'yet', 'so', 'familiar', 'represent', 'whole', 'world', 'Control', 'Room', 'intrusive', 'government', 'spying', 'mysterious', 'Rover', 'special', 'effect', ""n't"", 'aged', 'fear', 'wielded', 'Authority', 'enforcer', 'form', 'ominous', 'white', 'balloon', 'mysterious', 'little', 'butler', 'who', 'never', 'word', 'always', 'next', 'Authority', 'Penny', 'Farthing', 'bicycle', 'symbol', 'Village', 'logo', 'everyone', 'known', 'not', 'name', 'number', 'Prisoner', 'Number', '6', 'relatively', 'high', 'number', 'indicating', 'value', 'captors', ""'d"", 'surely', 'be', 'given', 'position', 'authority', 'cooperated', 'real', 'chairman', 'Village', 'ever-changing', 'No', '2', 'who', 'unseen', 'No', '1', 'shadowy', 'uber-authority', 'figure', 'Extras', 'far', 'best', '16mm', 'film', 'final', 'disk', 'showing', 'location', 'shooting', 'Portmeirion', 'famous', 'resort', 'North', 'Wales', 'priceless', 'footage', 'original', 'Rover', 'horrible', 'special', 'effect', 'giant', 'cupcake', 'light', 'top', 'McGoohan', 'ingeniously', 'replaced', 'weather', 'balloons', 'Then', 'fascinating', 'commentary', 'disk', '5', 'Production', 'Manager', 'Bernie', 'Williams', 'alternate', 'version', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'disk', '1', 'alternate', 'version', 'original', 'music', 'opening', 'credits', 'closing', 'credits', 'McGoohan', 'wisely', 'replaced', 'Still', 'fascinating', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'show', 'evolved', 'constant', 'improvements', 'up', 'till', 'first', 'airdate']",N/A

668784,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00005NKCQ,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 4]","TP is a great work of art. Unfortunately, tv is no different from any other arts medium in that rarely is greatness recognized off the bat. People always whine about tv's Wasteland, yet have tuned in regularly for such dull crap as Friends or the Cosby Show. People say they want boldness- even poetry, especially in these contemporary postmodern times. Yet, when confronted with 1 of the boldest works of art ever put forth, people whine that they may actually have to think  & not be passive. They reject it. 1 might call this the Stanley Kubrick Syndrome. It's no surprise that the other great piece of visual art that reigned in 1968 (along with TP & Planet Of The Apes) was Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. TP is also a great work of philosophy. Fundamentally it deals with the nature of reality, yet politically it also deals with the idea of rights (civil & human), which (if we are honest) we all know are a human law of invention, not a natural law of immanence. Now think: why is it that philosophy is 1 of the few endeavors more scorned than poetry? Because it's all ideas- it is inert. Art is ideas in motion, & the visual arts are the most accessible forms of art. & TP is a masterpiece of the visual arts in its philosophy. This DVD set (The Complete Prisoner) should ensconce itself on your shelves filled with Plato, Nietzsche, Holderlin, & the boys. Also, as to what it's all about, again- the point is open, & please put not too much stock in PM's explanation as artists are wont to missing the results they put out for they concentrate too much on the intent- plus, all artists of any worth are accomplished prevaricators- often willfully so. PM's art is served well by disinforming his public. So confused were critics & the viewing public that in all the years since I can think of only 2 tv shows that have some commonalities with TP- meaning its influence was limited.The 1st was American PBS's 1979 telefilm The Lathe Of Heaven, wherein the main character suffers a horrific trauma & literally lives within a dream- or does he? The other was the UPN network's 1995 1 season show Nowhere Man- starring Bruce Greenwood. In it a photojournalist takes a photo of a supposed Latin American execution & finds out his whole life may have been a charade. While not `imprisoned' like 6, the character- Tom Veil- seeks to regain his life by hitting the road to prove he is sane. TP & The Fugitive are the 2 dominant influences on this show- & it often paid subtle & overt homages to both. Unlike TP, however, this show was to be a regular series, but was canceled before its 1st season was over. This prompted the producers to wrap up the show hastily at 25 episodes. The result was an ending which aped TP's, but with none of the emotional impact, nor surrealism. What a shame, because the show was far superior to the Star Trek: Voyager show it aired after. & though dreams are a province film has often plumbed, about the only successful film of recent vintage that I would say is comparable is Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1990 Martian sci fi opus Total Recall. In that film Schwarzenegger's character is truly his own worst enemy! Another noteworthy point re: TP is that it may very well have been the 1st real `miniseries' to air in the US. While the 1970s saw Rich Man, Poor Man, Roots, The Holocaust, etc. make miniseries a staple, TP should truly be seen in their genre- after all, it was planned to be only 17 episodes long- about 14 hours of tv- shorter than Roots. Seen in that light it has still more significance. PM had the smarts to lace ambiguities throughout the show. 1 almost feels he was conducting an experiment & must've loved the control he/the show had over his/its fans. As I've stated, I think the best interpretation is that the whole show takes place in a moment of 6's mind (whether JD or not) as he is either heading to resign, contemplating the `fall out' of such a deed, or merely off on another adventure as Danger Man. It's not that unusual a trope- it's even classic, & since the penultimate episode is the last to start with 6 `waking up' the series can be seen circularly with 6 forever dreaming (dead?)- thanks go out for that possibility, too.Another little mentioned aspect of TP, as art, is that it is a nearly perfect piece of metacriticism on conspiracy theories in general- whether they're plausible theories as in JFK's assassination, or wacky theories involving aliens, Jewish bankers, & that lot. In fact, part of the show's `cult status' feeds off of that frenzy. Refer back to all the queries I have addressed, & the many others I have not (see assorted books & websites for what I mean). But if that does not convince you that this brilliant work of art also doubles as a brilliant piece of metacriticism, maybe this will: re-read my exposition of 6 as John Drake, get the DVD for yourself, & confirm what I say, & you will see I am correct. Wanna bet that my expos&eacute; is ridiculed by the TP cultists? In fact, the show inspires factions of fans who refuse logic & definitive proofs in whatever defense of their beliefs- no matter how wrong they are. Ain't art wonderful?Let me end this essay by possibly pulling a McGoohan (I shan't wrap things too tightly lest suffocate them- or am I feinting now?) & returning to the 4 points: apparent contradiction, particulars from the general, the general from particulars, & lastly TPD. As we've seen TP is chock with contradictions real & apparent. We've also seen these contradictions are often served by allowing the viewer to make deductive & inductive conclusions which not only are at odds given certain different information, but often from the same information. & before using TPD in a metaphoric way re: TP, consider this: the title, as we've seen is not necessarily specific to 6. Therefore let us consider 6 & 2 (or any other Villagers) to be eternally pondering the other's moves. 6 as the non-fink & the 2s as the finks who consistently win round after round- until the end. The 2s have all the perks, yet they all seem to have a not-so-secret envy of 6. What changes to allow the still seemingly non-finking 6 to win? (Or does he?) That may be the actual key question of the series, also never pondered before without the idea of TPD. Also, consider that TPD operates (theoretically) under unchanging rules- TP may or may not; & may or may not be self-consistent with its own consistency (or inconsistency).In the end it may well be that the ambiguity which damned TP's initial critical & public reception is the very thing which has proven to be its salvation. After decades of intermittent appearances the whole show can be owned for the price of a decent VCR or boombox. Trust me in that it is a much more sound investment you will mine over & again through the years. On reflection, perhaps there is no dilemma after all. Then, again, I told you I was gonna pull a McGoohan- or was that a McGuffin?",5,Brilliant,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,6923,"['TP', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'Unfortunately', 'tv', 'different',

There are some good ideas and set pieces here but they don't sustain the series for its entire 17 show run; there might be five worthwhile episodes, but that leaves a dozen stinkers and that's too many for a show as ephemeral as THE PRISONER.  The one without McGoohan is awful, so is the western, but the worst is the finale (and no, it didn't go over my head, it was just very irritating to watch and a lame wrap-up).  The best bits are few and far between: the Village locale and the opiated oblivious residents, the costuming, Rover, the silent butler character and the new #2 each week.  Ultimately the show's weaknesses overwhelm these sparse good ideas.I remember watching reruns of THE PRISONER in the late 80s with my 10-year-old.  At the conclusion of one episode she looked up me and said, ""I hate #6.""  Delighted by her insight I asked her why.  She replied, ""He always knows everything.""  After that I admit I started to hate #6 too.  How did he know everything?  I am of the opinion the miniature butler was telling him what #2 was plotting week after week.  #6 and the butler DO escape the Village together in the last show.  Was the Village a prison for secret agents who quit?  More than likely, the metaphor doesn't go any deeper than a golf tee.Weak scripting ultimately defeats the overall series.  Too, the fight scenes are always unconvincing and most of the players overact to the point of grade school amateurism, including #6.Want some good cult television programming from the same era?  Watch CALLAN.  It probably had a third of PRISONER's budget but utilized intelligent scripting and TV acting so good it'll actually startle you.",2,A good idea stretched out way too long,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,1771,"['THE', 'PRISONER', 'most', 'overrated', 'British', 'cult', 'show', 'even', 'SAPPHIRE', 'STEEL', 'better', 'are', 'good', 'ideas', 'set', 'pieces', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'sustain', 'series', 'entire', '17', 'show', 'run', 'might', 'be', 'five', 'worthwhile', 'episodes', 'dozen', 'stinkers', 'too', 'many', 'show', 'as', 'ephemeral', 'PRISONER', 'one', 'McGoohan', 'awful', 'so', 'western', 'worst', 'finale', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'head', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'irritating', 'watch', 'lame', 'wrap-up', 'best', 'bits', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Village', 'locale', 'opiated', 'oblivious', 'residents', 'costuming', 'Rover', 'silent', 'butler', 'character', 'new', '2', 'week', 'Ultimately', 'show', 'weaknesses', 'overwhelm', 'sparse', 'good', 'ideas.I', 'remember', 'watching', 'reruns', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'late', '80s', '10-year-old', 'conclusion', 'one', 'episode', 'looked', 'said', 'hate', '6', 'Delighted', 'insight', 'asked', 'why', 'replied', 'always', 'everything', 'admit', 'started', 'hate', '6', 'too', 'How', 'did', 'know', 'everything', 'am', 'opinion', 'miniature', 'butler', 'was', 'telling', 'what', '2', 'was', 'plotting', 'week', 'week', '6', 'butler', 'DO', 'escape', 'Village', 'together', 'last', 'show', 'Was', 'Village', 'prison', 'secret', 'agents', 'who', 'quit', 'More', 'likely', 'metaphor', ""n't"", 'go', 'deeper', 'golf', 'tee.Weak', 'scripting', 'ultimately', 'overall', 'series', 'Too', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'always', 'unconvincing', 'most', 'players', 'overact', 'point', 'grade', 'school', 'amateurism', 'including', '6.Want', 'good', 'cult', 'television', 'programming', 'same', 'era', 'Watch', 'CALLAN', 'probably', 'had', 'third', 'PRISONER', 'budget', 'utilized', 'intelligent', 'scripting', 'TV', 'acting', 'so', 'good', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'startle']",N/A

In a time when Get Smart was about as much thinking telly asked of its viewers, it was like an oasis in a desert, but some pulled a mental Charliehorse because it caused McGoohan to live the British Isles and head to Hollywood.He asked his viewers to think and they are still thinking decades later.McGoohan is ( if anyone following his career can see) playing the same character he did in two previous series out on video - John Drake from Dangerman and Secret Agent.  Though this is never said, that is the first point where McGoohan cracks the whip for us to jump.  The taut opening sequence shows a feed-up and angry agent demanded to be let go from the spy business (the car is McGoohan's own which he built himself).  We see him packing to get away from it all, his picture retired...but we also see what he does not - he is being followed.  Shortly, a gas filters into his room and you get a view of McGoohan's beautiful blue eyes as they world spins into a blur.He awakens, the room basically looks the same, but he soon discovers he is in a little bungalow in a place called THE VILLAGE and there is no escape.  From there McGoohan meets a progressions of villagers - all without names just numbers - and people, EVERYTHING MAKES you think.  There is NOTHING in this  right down to his clothing and to the numbers that is NOT important and of meaning!  He has been critised ( by those who just don't get it!!) that he keep the camera too much on himself - but they miss the point - he is the focus with his self examination of who are the bad guys and who are the good guys, and who is now keeping him prisoner.Hint, you gives you the clue from the very first...it is right there..if you pay attention.The DVD is packed with lot of goodies...the series is fun, it is provoking, it is brilliant and requires repeat viewing with each time you spotting more and more clues in Patrick's highly original riddle.Patrick, you will always be a name, not a number to me!!",5,Patrick's Masterpiece in all its Glory!,1033171200,"09 28, 2002",2002,2041,"['Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'created', 'masterpiece', 'asked', 'world', 'think', 'time', 'when', 'Get', 'Smart', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'thinking', 'telly', 'asked', 'viewers', 'was', 'oasis', 'desert', 'pulled', 'mental', 'Charliehorse', 'caused', 'McGoohan', 'live', 'British', 'Isles', 'head', 'Hollywood.He', 'asked', 'viewers', 'think', 'are', 'still', 'thinking', 'decades', 'later.McGoohan', 'anyone', 'following', 'career', 'can', 'see', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'did', 'two', 'previous', 'series', 'video', 'John', 'Drake', 'Dangerman', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'never', 'said', 'first', 'point', 'where', 'McGoohan', 'whip', 'jump', 'taut', 'opening', 'sequence', 'feed-up', 'angry', 'agent', 'demanded', 'be', 'let', 'go', 'spy', 'business', 'car', 'McGoohan', 'own', 'built', 'see', 'packing', 'get', 'away', 'picture', 'retired', 'also', 'see', 'what', 'not', 'being', 'followed', 'Shortly', 'gas', 'filters', 'room', 'get', 'view', 'McGoohan', 'beautiful', 'blue', 'eyes', 'world', 'blur.He', 'room', 'basically', 'same', 'soon', 'little', 'bungalow', 'place', 'called', 'THE', 'VILLAGE', 'escape', 'there', 'McGoohan', 'progressions', 'villagers', 'names', 'just', 'numbers', 'people', 'EVERYTHING', 'MAKES', 'think', 'NOTHING', 'right', 'down', 'clothing', 'numbers', 'NOT', 'important', 'meaning', 'been', 'critised', 'who', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'keep', 'camera', 'too', 'much', 'miss', 'point', 'focus', 'self', 'examination', 'who', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'who', 'now', 'keeping', 'prisoner.Hint', 'clue', 'very', 'first', 'right', 'there..if', 'pay', 'attention.The', 'DVD', 'packed', 'lot', 'goodies', 'series', 'fun', 'provoking', 'brilliant', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'time', 'spotting', 'more', 'more', 'clues', 'Patrick', 'highly', 'original', 'riddle.Patrick', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'name', 'not', 'number']",N/A

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","The 1967 TV series ""The Prisoner"" featured an agent who resigns from the British Secret Service, only to be abducted and held prisoner at a remote location, called The Village, for fear that he might be a traitor.  ""The Prisoner"" directly followed the highly successful ""Secret Agent/Danger Man"" series on British television.  Actor Patrick McGoohan played iconic agent John Drake in ""Danger Man"" and the remarkable prisoner ""Number Six"" in this series.""The Prisoner"" has a devoted following that has kept it in VHS/DVD production for over forty years, thanks to McGoohan's compelling portrayal of a cool, ironic, but stubbornly moral individual who refuses to bend to the insidious demands of the closed cell Village.  His often clever defiance and attempts to escape make for thought-provoking drama.  Number Six has no certain allies in the Village; his principal opponent is Number Two, the nominal manager.  In a role filled by a rotating cast of guest actors, Number Two's job is to ""break"" Number Six by any means, fair or foul, and find out why he left the Secret Service.The episodes typically feature tactics by which Number Two will try to get inside the head of Number Six, including trickery, mind control, moral traps, and some interesting interrogation techniques.  The level of creativity in the series in its persistant examination of moral dilemma continues to fascinate many years on.

Seriously here they are, all 17 episodes plus the Prisoner Video Companion originally offered on MCI Home Video now on DVD compliments of our good friends at A&amp;E. What's nicer is the episodes are arranged in what the fans believe to be the chronological order of the episodes in terms of Number 6's time in the Village rather than order of original airdate (although some of them are in airdate order). As a hint at this look carefully at &quot;The General&quot; and &quot;A, B and C&quot;. Both star Colin Gordon as Number 2, but in the opening for &quot;A, B and C&quot; he says &quot;I am number 2&quot; rather than &quot;The new number 2&quot;.

These appeared also to be shoved to the back a little as the series went on, in order to focus on less and less plausible scenarios. &lt;If the show had been more thorough in its conspiratorial leanings towards the end i would've been more positive. As it is, it has some wonderful insights into the nature of society and the individual, and the interactions between the two. It also brilliantly conveys the power struggle between the two by extrapolating to the near absurd setting with which we are presented.Some really powerful ideas and moments that will stay with me for the rest of my life occur within.

668807,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B00005NKCQ,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[12, 31]","First off, let me say that I did enjoy the series and the thrilling theme song by Ron Grainer is one of the best ever.Having said this, many people were disappointed or even angry at the way the series ended. They had assumed that they were watching a spy thriller series and thought that the final episode would wrap things up.  As the reader of these reviews has noted, that was not the case.  Instead the viewers were treated to a harangue by Patrick McGoohan who was apparently a very angry man and very disillusion by life in the Socialist Britain of the 1960's.  He left Britain for the US shortly after he made the series.  So did many other prominent Britons such as John Lennon, fleeing the confiscatory taxes and stifling bureaucracy that George Orwell called ""ENGSOC"" in his classic novel ""1984"".  Although other reviewers have pointed out much of the obscure symbolism seen in the series which was no doubt lost on the majority of viewers like myself,  it is clear that McGoohan is attacking the British establishment when we see him in the final episode, with No. 2/Leo McKern, and the butler outside the house of Parliament.  In an earlier episode, the Prisoner is accused of being ""unmutual"" which in a socialist society is very politcally incorrect.  On the other hand, although the Prisoner insists he is an individual and refuses to become a conformist, he opposes the ""turn on, tune in, drop out"" mentality of the hippies of the 1960's, indicated by the Alexis Kanner character unsuccessfully attempting to hitchhike, firstin one direction, then in the opposite, with no one stopping to pick him up.

It has maintained a cult following to this day.Patrick McGoohan was asked to do another episode of the popular Secret Agent Man but he came up with a counter proposal - he would return to TV if he was allowed control over a brand new series. The result was ""The Prisoner""Every episode begins with him  driving his  sports car to a government  building where he resigns as a secret agent. He returns home where  he is sprayed with sleeping gas. When he wakes he finds himself in a strange little hamlet (""The Village""). And with every episode he asks  ""who is number 1 ?"" ""the response is always ""I am number 2 -you are number 6"" to which McGowan always replies ""I am not a number I am a free man"".The quaint hamlet where he is  imprisoned is almost a type of utopia if it were not for the fact that its  purpose is to extract information from the villagers. The village's location is unknown and looks like a generic  and slightly Victorian era sea side town. The villagers are all assigned a number apparently corresponding with their  order of importance.Every episode begins  with McGoohan waking and with every episode McGoohan tries another way of escaping. In just about every episode the  man who runs things, number 2, is replaced.Number two's control center is an odd place  full of all sorts a gadgets  and displays and a man  looking as through he is closely monitoring something  from the perch of something that looks like a large teeter tauter that slowing  moves  up and down.My favorite character  is ""Rover"" a spherical blob that patrols the village and  when necessary, it is  pressed into devouring an inmate.Rover, when summoned,  bubbles up from the sea like  Freud's image of  thoughts  bubbling up from the Id.

It is never far from the nursery, therocking horse; at the same time it manages to be acerebral chess game. Intensely personal. Internal. TheVillage is every childhood dream of long ago, gone meltedand razor blade at the neck dangerous. This place ofginger bread houses and turrets and architecture thatseems made of spun sugar, good enough to eat. And allbelying the stark horror underneath. Colors that burst,perfect sharp edges, picture and sound and series itself.Patrick McGoohan as Number 6 is splendid. Sardonic,subtle, quirky; he can go from placid to deliciouslydemented it seems at a moment's notice, then back again.He has such a unique, brainy bent and style. You canactually see him thinking. He does not have to say a word.So many of the words said in the Village are brokensentences, fragment votives of sound, sometimesfragments of nursery rhymes. Fragile words as thoughspoken with an ear to china dishes softly crashing downsomewhere, giving another clue, perhaps, howeverenigmatic, about this place and who is running it and whyNumber 6 is there and what won't he tell them. I foundmyself listening and watching so carefully. It's so great todo that with a TV show again.All of it a Mad Tea Party. Some episodes directed andwritten by McGoohan, especially the penultimate and thefinal one are just such great gluey masterpieces. They aregiddy. To see and hear McGoohan and Leo McKern asNumber 2 go at it in a nursery setting, all tilted in themind, all sick tummy in the head, like the Grimm brothershave finally lost it, each man tearing out his and hisopponent's deepest fears,  needs, the wanting to go backto the beginning and cradle rock and this time get it right,whatever identity might be shuffling about--such tensionand tight acting, and close ups of two of the finest actorsone can be honored to enjoy--this is the ultimate secret ofthe series, I believe. You just want to dwell there.Even when Number 6 manages to escape the Village for atime, we see it still and all inside his head.  Many of thewords said by Number 6 and Number 2 and the othercharacters in the final two episodes are not reallynecessary. You can read it in them, like you've goneinside their bones. And when their bones become ""demdry bones,"" it is a sensory explosion, and if anyone thinksit's anticlimactic to find out who Number 1 may be, or is,is it another practical joke?, is to miss the series' wholepoint. Escape? I at least couldn't wait for him to get backto the Village, so it will continue.Because it was so much FUN there. Children's games.Brightly colored umbrellas. Wouldn't you really love tohave clothes like the prisoners wore there?  All thecaptives and captors powdered and rouged, and torn apartfrom the inside out,  all their souls, especially Number 6'sand all the Number 2's as well. But with such usually teacozy British politeness of course.There is Rover and tiddly insanity. It's a mad society gonemadder. Life as we know it. The rules keep changing. Thetreats and the seductions turn us one way and then in aheart beat or less, just the other. It is flannel nightie or softcomforting blankie, but with a rattlesnake, no matter howpolite, underneath who might just possibly be as scared aswe are. In short, it's us and them, fun house reality.Everything works. The machines and the clean lines andthe tick tock of the clockwork and the outrageousness ofthe episodes, that do everything from parodying SergioLeone movies, to a quick nod to ""Mission: Impossible,""and more than that to ""The Avengers""--another  smartcerebral nursery room series in its own endearing way--itscontemporaries. But the true madness of the Prisoner'srationale is hidden in his madness, for it is something sobetween that and sanity, that it really doesn't matter whatthe mind conceives, it is just the getting caught up in thething that counts.Freedom is what you make it. And when Number 6makes it, or of course does he?, then we have lost a goodfriend. And if we can run full blast across a busy Londonstreet with No. 6 and the butler from the each episode,played brilliantly by Angelo Muscat, so minimalist andself-contained, and NOT FORGOTTEN, as a cruel writersaid he had been, if we can join hands with them andbound forth between cars in glorious free sunlight, if wefind ourselves, as I did, weeping at this point, then noneed to wonder why, no need at all.For we are losing our friends. But happily they've comehome, in this brilliant DVD mega set.  The intimacy of it isperfect for taking into our hearts right there, in our ownVillages, otherwise known as home, or  as trueprotections against the outside world which is the Village.Chinese boxes within Chinese boxes. Never the secretrevealed. As McGoohan has said, if you explain theanalogy, the symbolism, then what's the point?Perhaps some summer afternoon when the grass is toogreen and the houses around me seem colored with cakefrosting, I'll pick up a paper outside the general storewhere I've gone to get a map; the paper of course will be""The Tally-Ho"" with the front page story of the Prisonerspeaking his mind, news to him. And always thatpossibility that our hero too will crack, for the danger ofmadness beyond the next rounded pink housed cornermight come shambling out for him also. Keeping in mindwe really don't know who Number 6 is, either. It's just aTV show you are watching.Or is it watching you?

Martinez,"[98, 203]","Let's say you're a business that already has made a wonderful ""40th Anniversary Version"" of a DVD set with all the bells and whistles... now why should you then be allowed to create a different version of the same thing only a few years later?A&E; should be ashamed of themselves for doing what everyone lately is now doing: they've realized that (most) of the DVD buying public will buy ANYTHING if you re-package it as a ""Special Collection,"" or a ""Ultimate Collection,"" ""Director's Cut,"" ""Unrated Cut"" or ""Extended Cut.""But in the case of ""The Prisoner: The Complete Series Megaset (Collector's Edition),"" we are seeing the ""40th Anniversary Set"", just with new packaging.I have been surfing around as of late and have found NOTHING to describe to me what's included in the ""new"" package.Any new interviews? I don't know.Any new lost footage? I don't know.Any kind of newer extras not on the ""Anniversary version""? I don't know.Any other information anywhere online about what's on it at all? I don't know.Remastered? They were the first time around.Blu-Ray? Yes, but this could have been done with the same package.You see where I'm going here. To quote the A&E; website, who is also selling it, they are only saying ""Within this complete 17-episode set, all is revealed. Or is it?""Now what kind of garbagey pap is that? What's the technical end? What's included that is different from what's already out there? It makes me wonder why they even needed to remake a ""Collector's Set"" in the first place.It is essentially the ""40th Anniversary"" DVD box set, just repackaged with a new set of covers. As far as I can see from the item descriptions of both sets IT'S THE SAME ITEM THEY SOLD TO US A FEW YEARS BACK.To be honest, I was happy with that set as it fed my obsession, and I thought there was nowhere else to go with it. SEE FOR YOURSELF!...The Prisoner: The Complete Series Megaset (Collector's Edition)Product Details* Actors: Patrick McGoohan* Format: Box set, Collector's Edition, Color, DVD, NTSC* Language: English* Number of discs: 10* Rating: NR (Not Rated)* Studio: A&E; Home Video* DVD Release Date: October 27, 2009* Run Time: 884 minutesThe Prisoner - Complete Series Megaset (40th Anniversary Edition)Product Details* Actors: Patrick McGoohan* Format: Box set, Closed-captioned, Collector's Edition, Color, Original recording remastered, NTSC* Language: English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)* Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only. Read more about DVD formats.)* Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1* Number of discs: 10* Rating: NR (Not Rated)* Studio: A&E; Home Video* DVD Release Date: July 25, 2006* Run Time: 884 minutesSame running time, same number of discs!This only leads me to CONCLUDE that they are neither adding nor subtracting anything to this release except to repackage a horse that's been in the corral for over 3 years. But the question remains: Why are they doing this?Well, it's simple: to sell DVD sets to lots of naive customers who didn't know the ""Anniversary Set"" exists and then buy essentially the SAME ITEM at a higher price!Used box sets of the ""40th"" are pretty cheap right now, so why buy the redesigned package? - except to make A&E; a few dollars more. Oh, and it's no small coincidence that they are releasing it about the same time as the upcoming AMC series ""Prisoner"" reboot.This is sad, and once again, A&E; should be ashamed of themselves.And, to sidebar a moment about that new series...Now, even though Ian McKellen has been chosen to play Number Two (and that's okay), how can anyone justify American actor Jim Caviezel as Number Six when we all know this was a British actor's dream role?I really can't really name a movie or show he's been in where he impressed me EXCEPT for his performance in ""Frequency,"" which according to the IMDB website, is all he's ever done in the sci-fi realm.I guess I'm picky when it comes to my choice of The Prisoner, because you would think they'd put someone in there with a backbone - and DOESN'T CRY IN EVERY SINGLE ROLE HE'S BEEN IN. This potentially sounds HORRIBLE.I say give me Clive Owen, he seems sullen enough, and he proved to me he could tackle the complexities of sci-fi in his dazzling role in ""Children of Men.""(Back to the DVD review, as I'm digressing too much here... but to get a bit personal now...)Cash is king and AMC and A&E; are warming their collective hands over the bones of the highly-protective-of-the-series Patrick McGoohan, whom they waited patiently until he died so that they could then start mining his show that he created and wanted left untouched.And to be honest, there are more than a few of us who'd also like to leave this kept pure as well. No, we didn't need a remake or a reboot, and there are SO many people I know who've asked why do it at all?The release of this DVD set only goes to show me integrity, like clothing, can be shed for the right price, and AMC and A&E; will NEVER receive another consumer dollar from ME.Once again, since there are no technical details available anywhere except from what I found on this very website, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to assume that it's the same set just re-packged to deceive people, and because of that I'm giving this one star.THERE IS NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT WHAT'S ON IT THAT'S NEW, so why award a company clearly out for profit?For the last time, and I'll be honest, it won't be the last time for me... A&E; should BE ASHAMED OF ITSELF for doing this.I'm going to tell everyone I know to watch out for this deception AND NOT BUY THIS SET until I mysteriously vanish or this review is deleted, and since I'm the first one here to voice my dissention, I'll be on some faraway island soon enough, assigned a number, and then be forced to watch Jim Caviezel cry.Thanks for reading, and before I mysteriously die or vanish, read my other reviews and find out the truth for yoursel================================",1,A&E should be ashamed of itself for deceiving the people,1254355200,"10 1,

668825,A1QQDHM5YMLQ8Z,B00005NKCQ,"Joseph Albanese ""The Joe Show""","[1, 1]","Time has done little to diminish the quirky impact that THE PRISONER has upon its audience.  First seen in the USA as a summer series in 1967, it managed to capture the psychadelic, day-glo, pop culture mood on the surface while narrowly riding along on an almost Orwellian plot conception.  It was talked about, pondered, and discussed. Some admired the series citing it as a look into the 1984 society that might be descending upon us. Others were confused as it was hardly your average series.  Even the star, Patrick McGoohan, was better known as the ""James-Bond-type"" Secret Agent Man, seemed to be either trying to astound or confuse the audience.  The nearest America had to THE PRISONER was the pop-psychadelic The Avengers but even that, while bending the rules, still played the game in the tried and true way.Here was a mystery wrapped in a pop-art engima.  Who was the prisoner?  ""I am not a number"" was a catch phrase but one that struck the war weary world a bit too close to home for them to feel comfortable with it.  Why was he there and, more to the point, where exactly is there?Although I saw it before, this time I noticed cordless phone, flat screen televisions and other things that were too minute that I did not get them the first go-round.The Blu-Ray DVD, providing us with all the episodes (including the infamous LIVING IN HARMONY wild west episode that was excluded when the program aired originally in the USA) does one of the best jobs of reproducing the series to disk.  The colors are vivid and intense and for the first time you can see the details of the village.  Suddenly everything (the colorful uniforms and umbrellas - are they rainbow bright? the colors of the Vatican guards?) and the scenery pops out at you.  But there is still the haunting and captivating tale that awaits viewers.  It is truly one of those series that you can watch many times over and discover something new or different with each viewing.The final episode, FALL OUT, sparked a controversy.  A series that had captured and confused with its allegorical illusions now confounded the audience.

668827,A3OPWR72IQ2DN0,B00005NKCQ,jpop,"[2, 2]","The original ""Prisoner"" was a groundbreaking and intriguing example of sixties British television.  It was conceived at a time when James Bond and Secret Agents were popular.  I would think that most people would be drawn to this program thinking it was a continuation of star Patrick McGoohan's previous show, ""Secret Agent"".  In some ways it is.At the beginning we see a supposed government agent emphatically resigning from service.  When he arrives at his flat in London, a strange gas renders him unconscious. When he awakes he is on his bed in a duplicate of his London Apartment.  When he gets up and looks outside, his surroundings are totally unfamiliar.  He is now in a small resort-like village where people dress in colorful garb and address each other with numbers instead of names.  Soon he finds out that he is not allowed to leave and that his captors are very interested in why he resigned and where his loyalties might lie.On the surface, this is a good premise for an action adventure ""James Bond"" type of program.  If that's what you're looking for then you may not want this in your collection.  ""The Prisoner"", (in the words of star and co-creator Patrick McGoohan) is an allegory.  This means there are a lot of hidden meanings, underlying messages and a refracted view of life as we know it.Of the seventeen episodes produced, some actually have a plot you can follow that lead to a satisfying conclusion of some sort (""A, B and C"", ""The Chimes of Big Ben"", and ""Arrival"" e.g.) Others require your patience as the story seems to become frustratingly incoherent (""Once Upon A Time"",""Fallout"", etc).Some of this can be explained by the fact that the program was originally planned as a seven episode ""mini-series"" but turned into a seventeen episode series once it became popular.  Some of the episodes seem like ""filler""  due to production limitations and time constraints (""Do Not Foresake Me Oh My Darling"", ""The Girl Who Was Death"").  But don't let this deter you from owning this set.There has never been a series like it before nor has there been one since.  You can view the episodes several times and still not see or comprehend everything that's being thrown your way.  McGoohan is excellently eccentric in every way.  Some of the ideas and presentations will fascinate you and provoke you at the same time.  Don't confuse this original series with the recent remake broadcast on AMC.  That ""re-imagining"" missed the target completely.

Unfortunately, it would often be pre-empted for Minnesota Twins baseball games!  I never saw the complete series until it was aired on a local station about 15 years ago.  It is an astounding production.  Unfortunately, the last episode, in which we are supposedly going to discover who ""Number One"" is, turns into a typical 60s surreal joke.  It reminds me of the Beatles song ""I am the walrus.""  We all tried to find the profound ""meaning"" of the lyrics when (according to writer John Lennon) it turned out the lyrics were gibberish.

668829,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B00005NKCQ,Kathy-W,"[1, 1]","I don't know why I waited so long to watch this show. I'm such a late comer to it that there almost isn't a point in rehashing old territory that others have already noted, but it all made such a strong impression on me that I can't help but add my praise to the pile. These are just general remarks - I could go on all day about this show, but won't.While many older shows are enjoyable for the sake of enjoyment, ""The Prisoner"" is like a mental exercise. Certain aspects and themes are relentless throughout, which is only fitting for a show that was groundbreaking then and is still very special now. Privacy vs. surveillance, community vs. individuality, well-being vs. choice - who can say that these aren't current issues in almost any society? This series never stops tapping you on the shoulder, but it also never feels like pointless whining.McGoohan is tremendous. You can see the love he had for this project in every single episode, and maybe that's what makes this otherwise disturbing show intriguing and timeless. Number Six rages, stomps, sneaks, charms, and quips his way out of various situations - and even when he can't avoid trouble, he still shows a quiet, graceful refusal to give up or give in. There are many sobering moments in each episode, but they are handled so gallantly that it's mesmerizing rather than depressing. Number Six is both martyr and hero not because he's simply a ""good guy"" but because he stands up and questions even a very small impingement on personal freedoms. After leaving the service, he honestly just wants to be left alone, but he has a long fight to get through before he has that chance. He is an ultimate example of the ""reluctant hero"" archetype, partly because he eventually realizes that he's the only person in The Village who is willing to really question authority's judgment (the age-old problem of ""who's minding the minders?"").  Forgive me for saying it, but in a way, this is the stuff of good comic books.Beware, though: this is not a show you can watch while multitasking. Many intelligent moments and details are silent ones, so you won't catch the full power of this show just from the dialogue. Incidentally (or consequently?), the dialogue is sometimes sparse, but that never makes it weak. Number Six is literally a man of few words sometimes, but this becomes a strong metaphor for the necessity of keeping oneself to oneself in a society that prizes insipid mass activities and regards solitude as a threat to security (sound familiar, anybody?).The curious part is that while this show bears typical marks of 1960s television - loud colors and some artsy camera work, for starters - the circumstances and premise of the series make all the pieces of this puzzle fit very nicely and feel quite natural. Everything looks strange because it IS strange. As a matter of fact, even the quintessentially `60s elements of this show are more tasteful than the ""norm"" of its day. In many ways, this show attempted to break away from ruts of that decade (for example, the music is actually rather subtle and understated at times). Hollow lines and cliches in the scripts are rare, and convenient, happy endings are not common in the plots. The episode ""Free for All"" is an especially gripping one for this reason (and, bizarrely, highlights the futility of doing what other people want) but I won't give out any spoilers here.Watch out for some interesting work from Leo McKern (sadly only in 3 episodes) and a neat early appearance by Paul Eddington (in the first episode).",5,"Fascinating, befuddling, amusing, infuriating, PIONEERING!!",1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,3541,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'watch', 'show', ""'m"", 'such', 'late', 'comer', 'almost', ""n't"", 'point', 'rehashing', 'old', 'territory', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'noted', 'all', 'made', 'strong', 'impression', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'add', 'praise', 'pile', 'are', 'just', 'general', 'remarks', 'could', 'go', 'day', 'show', 'many', 'older', 'shows', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'sake', 'enjoyment', 'Prisoner', 'mental', 'exercise', 'Certain', 'aspects', 'themes', 'are', 'relentless', 'only', 'fitting', 'show', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'then', 'still', 'very', 'special', 'now', 'Privacy', 'vs.', 'surveillance', 'community', 'vs.', 'individuality', 'well-being', 'vs.', 'choice', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'current', 'issues', 'almost', 'society', 'series', 'never', 'tapping', 'shoulder', 'also', 'never', 'feels', 'pointless', 'whining.McGoohan', 'tremendous', 'can', 'see', 'love', 'had', 'project', 'single', 'episode', 'maybe', 'what', 'otherwise', 'disturbing', 'show', 'intriguing', 'timeless', 'Number', 'Six', 'rages', 'stomps', 'sneaks', 'charms', 'way', 'various', 'situations', 'even', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'trouble', 'still', 'quiet', 'graceful', 'refusal', 'give', 'up', 'give', 'are', 'many', 'sobering', 'moments', 'episode', 'are', 'handled', 'so', 'gallantly', 'mesmerizing', 'rather', 'depressing', 'Number', 'Six', 'martyr', 'hero', 'not', 'simply', 'good', 'guy', 'up', 'questions', 'even', 'very', 'small', 'impingement', 'personal', 'freedoms', 'leaving', 'service', 'honestly', 'just', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'long', 'fight', 'get', 'chance', 'ultimate', 'example', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'archetype', 'partly', 'eventually', 'only', 'person', 'Village', 'who', 'willing', 'really', 'question', 'authority', 'judgment', 'age-old', 'problem', 'who', 'minding', 'minders', 'Forgive', 'saying', 'way', 'stuff', 'good', 'comic', 'books.Beware', 'not', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'multitasking', 'Many', 'intelligent', 'moments', 'details', 'are', 'silent', 'ones', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'full', 'power', 'show', 'just', 'dialogue', 'Incidentally', 'consequently', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'sparse', 'never', 'weak', 'Number', 'Six', 'literally', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'sometimes', 'strong', 'metaphor', 'necessity', 'keeping', 'oneself', 'society', 'insipid', 'mass', 'activities', 'regards', 'solitude', 'threat', 'security', 'sound', 'familiar', 'anybody', '.The', 'curious', 'part', 'show', 'typical', 'marks', '1960s', 'television', 'loud', 'colors', 'artsy', 'camera', 'work', 'starters', 'circumstances', 'premise', 'series', 'make', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'fit', 'very', 'nicely', 'feel', 'quite', 'natural', 'Everything', 'strange', 'strange', 'matter', 'fact', 'even', 'quintessentially', '60s', 'elements', 'show', 'are', 'more', 'tasteful', 'norm', 'day', 'many', 'ways', 'show', 'attempted', 'break', 'away', 'ruts', 'decade', 'example', 'music', 'actually', 'rather', 'subtle', 'understated', 'times', 'Hollow', 'lines', 'cliches', 'scripts', 'are', 'rare', 'convenient', 'happy', 'endings', 'are', 'not', 'common', 'plots', 'episode', 'Free', 'especially', 'gripping', 'one', 'reason', 'bizarrely', 'futility', 'doing', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'want', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'out', 'spoilers', 'here.Watch', 'out', 'interesting', 'work', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'sadly', 'only', '3', 'episodes', 'neat', 'early', 'appearance', 'Paul', 'Eddington', 'first', 'episode']",N/A

The colors are stunning, and the detail around certain background objects and signs is remarkable (especially for this series, where every detail literally means something in the overall plot).  The audio quality is amazing, even better than the Network DVD set.  I cannot believe the absolutely remarkable experience that this Blu-Ray is; certainly one of the best Blu-Ray releases of the year.  It makes an already remarkable television milestone into an event.  I have just started watching this with my 13 year old daughter who was totally captivated by ""Arrival"" earlier this evening, and she is absolutely excited about seeing the rest of the series with me.  She is *very* good at picking up symbolism and hidden plot lines (she's pointed out things in ""Babylon 5"" to me that I've never noticed before, and I've had to have seen the entire series at least 5 or 6 times) and was having a blast tonight.  Come to think of it, so was I...thanks to the new amount of detail in the discs, I am seeing things I never have before.A&E; are to be commended on their decision to use the outstanding Network transfers, and put together a release worthy of the show itself.  As a few other reviewers have said, it might have been nice with more elaborate packaging; but it's the content, audio, and video of the show that counts, and this release has that in abundance.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED; A MUST PURCHASE!ORIGINAL REVIEW:If you have never seen this brilliant piece of television, you must.  It is generally considered to be the first mini-series for television; an incredible tour de force.If these are indeed the Network DVD Transfers from the UK, then this set could be absolutely the best release on Blu for the year.  The Network transfers are STUNNING, and they also have 5.1 audio (there's mono for the purists).Hopefully, A&E; will wake up and use what has ALREADY been digitally remastered by Network.  Otherwise, this will go down as an incredible disappointment because the A&E; DVD versions were nowhere near as good as the Network ones.  (Network has also done spectacular remastering for Space 1999 Series One and The Champions).I'm going to sit this one out before I order it until I know for certain that the picture and the audio are at least as awesome as the Network transfers.  (I don't know who the current rights holders are; Network owns the Gerry Anderson show rights currently; a remastered Fireball XL 5 is coming out on Region 2 DVD in a few weeks).Like I said, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for the content...and QED as far as the Blu Ray goes.

Hunter,"[6, 9]","What a treat it is to have this series on DVD, so that we can reassess this oddball series, and finally figure out what McGoohans was trying to say. The Prisoner is frequently compared toAnimal Farm and 1984(especially ""The General""). But it owes much, if not more, toBrave New World and Brave New World RevisitedandAnthem. Huxley suggested that we control people not by pain, but by pleasure. Everyone is coked-up and enjoying themselves. In the Village, everyone is on perpetual holiday.So this is a series with an uncomfortable message. But the best TV shows do that. When one considers episodes such as ""The Obsolete Man,"" or ""Eye of the Beholder,"" the Prisoner is more of a successor to The Twilight Zone than Night Gallery.So watch, enjoy, and then think. For the confusing aspects of the series--and there are many--The Official Prisoner Companionis indispensable.The only drawback to this series was that the concept was limited. The filler episodes tacked on to the core seven got redundant and grating. It was a wise choice to limit the series to a mere miniseries of 17. It got the message across without the fluff and drag.So here are some of my favorite key episodes.""Free For All"" is a wicked critiques of elections. Think back on the past five or six elections, and really, how much control the little guy have over the candidate. And once in power, how much control would Mr. Smith really have? (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) InReal Change: The Fight for America's Future, Newt Gingrich observed the power fissure between the Young Turks that got elected under the Contract With America, and the stodgy incumbents with seniority. The Young Turks had the mandate, but the Incumbents had no sense of mission. And there was no way a Jimmy Stewart could filibuster in the House.The most disturbing image is the group of men encircling--or is it worshiping?--the throbbing Rover. Are they worshiping the Village's embodiment of brute force?""The General""--which was my first episode--is a similarly wicked critique of education. Specifically, McGoohan combines his disdain for education mills--blipvert degrees--with the dread of bureaucracies utilizing computes. The ""row of cabbages"" quote makes the episodes, along with the red-room of non-conformists, and the unanswered question--""WHY?""C. S. Lewis's ""Screwtape Proposes A Toast,"" ""Abolition of Man,"" and ""That Hideous Strength"" take this issue to a more philosophical level.""The Chimes of Big Ben"" is blessed with the best No. 2 in the series, and tackles the problems of state-sponsored art. Watch this episode where all artifacts laud the Cult of No. 2, and then check out the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. Think, people!""Change of Mind"" and ""Once Upon A Time"" deal with forcible brainwashing. Collectivist Colossi do not suffer fools lightly. That is why the Milgram Experiment andThe Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evilmake crucial reading.""Hammer into Anvil"" is a favorite.  No. 6 turns the tables on No. 2, and is a great example of Sun-Tzu's dictum of attacking the opponents strategy (The Art of War). He uses the paranoia against No. 2 in a delightful way, worthy of Br'er Rabbit orThe Scarlet Pimpernel.""Living In Harmony"" Clearly this is the oddest episode of an already oddball series. But it illustrates a key point: The Prisoner is not about spies and escape, but about the universal principle of conformity and coercion.Rod Serling once said, ""The Twilight Zone has existed in many lands, in many times. It has its roots in history, in something that happened long, long ago and got told about and handed down from one generation of folk to the other. In the telling the story gets added to and embroidered on, so that what might have happened in the time of the Druids is told as if it took place yesterday in the Blue Ridge Mountains.""The same could be said about the Village. It is a universal evil found in schools, boy and girl scout troops, political parties, religions, congresses, labor unions, and even families. The Bible (and MiltonParadise Lost (Penguin Classics)) speak about a war in heaven, so even the angels are not immune from the Village. It could happen anywhere, or as this episode illustrates, anywhen.So when we hear politicians speak of a Global Village, watch out!*My take on the ending is simple. The whole series is a mixture of absurdity and surrealism, so the ending must likewise be surreal and absurd. No. 6 wears No. 2 to a quivering pulp, and earns the right to meet No. 1. Of course we could not expect a clich&eacute;d Mr. Big or Goldfinger. The only possible resolution was for No. 6 to confront himself. No. 6 meets No. 1, removes the Ape Mask, symbolic of the Apish aspect of humanity. Behind the trousered Ape is himself.Number 6 was his own jailer.He manages to free the lad from the clich&eacute;s of existence, and also to return No. 2 back to a respectable John Bull middle-class existence and to Parliament. The lower-class Butler is also freed form the Village. No. Six is the liberator of all classes. Once we free ourselves, we can free others.",4,"""It Takes A Village.""",1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,5110,"['What', 'treat', 'have', 'series', 'DVD', 'can', 'reassess', 'oddball', 'series',

So much has been written or spoken about The Prisoner that it makes yet another review, especially here, seem rather unnecessary, but allow me to shed some new light on this wonderfully crafted and thought-provoking series that has inspired a slew of criticism, documentaries, and a franchise that sponsors fan-inspired annual pilgrimages and symposiums to Portmerion (Wales) where the series was filmed in 1967.To this day, the series has managed to inspire debate and defy  interpretation--are the episodes merely the dreams and nightmares of a British secret agent who has resigned, or is No. 6's fight against the dystopia that is the Village analogous to our own fight for individualism, privacy and personal freedom? And now, perhaps even more relevant today than in 1967 when the series made its initial broadcast run--incidentally as a summer replacement for the ""Jackie Gleason Show"".So many of the episodes are as thought-provoking as McGoohans's own inspiration for the series.  Despite what McGoohan may insist and what the critics say, I strongly believe that No. 6 is John Drake of ""Secret Agent Man."" (Co-creator and writer George Markstein always insisted that No. 6 was Drake.) To appreciate this you must view the series back-to-back to see why; the latter episodes of ""Secret Agent"" show Drake often bucking horns with his superiors at virtually every opportunity and clearly a few episodes of ""Secret Agent"" would help you to see my point: specifically ""Colony Three"" and ""The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove""--two perplexing and puzzling installments in a rather straightforward, weekly prime-time spy drama. Be sure to check them out.We all know the wonderful English guest stars who appeared as No. 2, so I don't need to go into detail here--Leo McKern (""Chimes of Big Ben,"" ""Once Upon a Time,"" and ""Fall Out"") and Colin Gordon (""A, B, & C"") are two of my favorites. As to the quality of the DVDs themselves, A&E; has done a superb job with this set--super clean transfers and excellent Dolby sound.Also included are some alternate title sequences, the alternate ""Chimes of Big Ben,"" and an interview/documentary with director David Tomblin--I am not surprised McGoohan did not offer an interview or a commentary--he wants to keep us guessing and that, of course, is half the fun to this enigma which is ""The Prisoner.""The additional booklet and map added to this new slimline set is a nice additional touch, but I think Prisoner devotees deserve much more from A&E; since much of this type of merchandise is already available from other sources.",5,Groudbreaking series that changed TV forever...,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,2577,"['How', 'begin', 'So', 'much', 'been', 'written', 'spoken', 'Prisoner', 'yet', 'review', 'especially', 'here', 'seem', 'rather', 'unnecessary', 'allow', 'shed', 'new', 'light', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'thought-provoking', 'series', 'inspired', 'slew', 'criticism', 'documentaries', 'franchise', 'fan-inspired', 'annual', 'pilgrimages', 'symposiums', 'Portmerion', 'Wales', 'where', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', '1967.To', 'day', 'series', 'managed', 'inspire', 'debate', 'defy', 'interpretation', 'are', 'episodes', 'merely', 'dreams', 'nightmares', 'British', 'secret', 'agent', 'who', 'resigned', '6', 'fight', 'dystopia', 'Village', 'analogous', 'own', 'fight', 'individualism', 'privacy', 'personal', 'freedom', 'now', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', '1967', 'when', 'series', 'made', 'initial', 'broadcast', 'run', 'incidentally', 'summer', 'replacement', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'Show', '.So', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'as', 'thought-provoking', 'McGoohans', 'own', 'inspiration', 'series', 'what', 'McGoohan', 'may', 'insist', 'what', 'critics', 'say', 'strongly', 'believe', 'No', '6', 'John', 'Drake', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'Man', 'Co-creator', 'writer', 'George', 'Markstein', 'always', 'insisted', 'No', '6', 'was', 'Drake', 'appreciate', 'must', 'view', 'series', 'back-to-back', 'see', 'why', 'latter', 'episodes', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'show', 'Drake', 'often', 'bucking', 'horns', 'superiors', 'virtually', 'opportunity', 'clearly', 'few', 'episodes', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'would', 'help', 'see', 'point', 'specifically', 'Colony', 'Three', 'Ubiquitous', 'Mr.', 'Lovegrove', 'two', 'perplexing', 'puzzling', 'installments', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'weekly', 'prime-time', 'spy', 'drama', 'Be', 'sure', 'check', 'out.We', 'know', 'wonderful', 'English', 'guest', 'stars', 'who', 'appeared', 'No', '2', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'detail', 'here', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'Once', 'Time', 'Fall', 'Out', 'Colin', 'Gordon', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'are', 'two', 'favorites', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'A', 'E', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'set', 'super', 'clean', 'transfers', 'excellent', 'Dolby', 'sound.Also', 'included', 'are', 'alternate', 'title', 'sequences', 'alternate', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'interview/documentary', 'director', 'David', 'Tomblin', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'McGoohan', 'did', 'not', 'offer', 'interview', 'commentary', 'keep', 'guessing', 'course', 'fun', 'enigma', 'Prisoner', 'additional', 'booklet', 'map', 'added', 'new', 'slimline', 'set', 'nice', 'additional', 'touch', 'think', 'Prisoner', 'devotees', 'deserve', 'much', 'more', 'A', 'E', 'much', 'type', 'merchandise', 'already', 'available', 'other', 'sources']",N/A

Yet another felt that it was masking the star's bisexuality.  McGoohan himself said that there were no definitive interpretations to the episodes.  One thing I notice is that many fans tout the ""individual against the community"" angle, but if you watch the episodes from a different viewpoint, you might also notice alternate messages, such as little hints that the individual over everything else isn't always a good thing.

With all of the ""eyes only"" info locked always in these spy's heads, plenty of parties either want this information, or they want to make sure it isn't given to the wrong parties. Enter ""The Village"" a surreal (as only the late 60's can do surreal) place to extract or lock away said information. Just like in the spy game these spys become numbers not names.

Who's side is anyone on? Are the cold war baddies running the Village or Number 6's former employers?....Questions are a burden on others and a prison for oneself.Number 6 is #1 !!! The original ""paranoid"" series is back for it's 40th birthday, with it a look back to the mind-bending series that not only created the paranoid-conspiracy series (like those that sprung-up in the 80's), but it also created the MINI-SERIES, before there were mini-series (in fact the studios failed to see this vision and insisted on padded episodes to stretch it out to a full season).This is a must see exploration of what is means to be an individual in a society that wish us to conform. The message rings as loudly today as it did in the 60's, although the sets are groovy, and the effects dated, there is a timelessness in the Village that keeps the series watchable even today.Comics, novels and heavy metal tributes, we've never left the Village.

Not even PRISONER star Patrick McGoohan will provide the answer.  The episodes alternate between psychedelic and bizzare to straight-forward spytech.

In the United States it served as a temporary replacement for the Jackie Gleason show and did not garner magnificent ratings.  It was in syndication that the show acquired a following.Patrick McGoohan stepped out of his role of John Drake from DANGER MAN and right into THE PRISONER.  Unfortunately, the series was designed to be of limited duration.  As such, the episodes are not numerous.

However deeply you decide to invest your thoughts, it will not go unrewarded.  The Prisoner is simply the best television show ever made and one of the few that actually attempts to make the disposable medium ""art.""  The fact that I'm writing about it nearly  40s years later is a testament to the achievement of the singularly minded force behind it: the star, Patrick McGoohan.McGoohan had come off a second 2-year run of his popular ""Danger Man"" series.  The first series ran from 1960-62, the second from 1964-66 ... look them up on this site for further info ... and were hugely successful both in the UK and in the US.  He had already turned down the role of 007 before it was offered to Sean Connery for various ""moral reasons"" which still seem vague to this day.  He seemed to find the character of Bond's habit of killing and womanizing distasteful.  In 1962, this wasn't such a big deal.  James Bond had been a popular series of novels and the first movie was considered a modest undertaking at best.  (Future Bond and current star of ""The Saint"" Roger Moore was approached and also turned it down.)  Fast-forward to 1966, as McGoohan's own show was now going into its 5th year, he was offered the role again.  It had gone from a cult possibility in 1962 to international icon status in just 5 years.  It would have made McGoohan an international superstar.  He turned it down again.  There are rumors that he was even offered the role a third time, though I can't figure out when that would have been.  Also, by this time, McGoohan was growing tired of the spy format and decided to start a new show, despite the fact that filming had already begun on the next series.  What was needed was a concept that would continue to utilize his popular public image of good-looking leading man hero and his Bond-like secret agent character, while twisting them up in psychedelia and strange psychological concepts.  McGoohan was, although there appear to have been no consciously stated thoughts on the subject, about to turn the world inside out.The obvious angle to understand The Prisoner is the literal interpretation:  A secret agent, most likely McGoohan's character from ""Danger Man"" (called ""Secret Agent"" in the US), resigns from his job.  We never know why and in the opening his dialogue is covered by thunder clapping and music.  We know he's mad and he slams his resignation on the desk.  He is then drugged, kidnapped, and wakes up in the Village, which is like a resort hotel (it is in real life).  Its a place he can never leave.  He doesn't even know who's running it; East or West.  All they want to know is why he resigned, but he's a stubborn man and an expert spy.  Only the most sophisticated methods could get him to talk.  He is not called a name.  No one has names, only numbers.  He is Number 6.  Each week he is continually tortured, etc, by a revolving set of Number 2's, the seeming master of the Village.  But, there is a Number 1 ... always unseen, always watching.  Throughout the remainder of the episodes, the Prisoner is forced to undergo mind-altering experiments, some subtle, some not, all the while attempting to escape.  He never does.  Or does he?The second way to view the series is as an allegory for the plight of the Everyman against the machine-like nature of society.  This is the stated aim of the program's bizarre, seemingly undecipherable ending.  The revelation of the identity of Number 1 was awaited with such anticipation in Europe that the actual event itself caused McGoohan to return to his birthplace (the US) for good.However, the Everyman allegory doesn't quite fit all the facts.  It seems more personal and, as the series went on, McGoohan seemed more and more determined to ditch the original ""espionage prison camp"" idea, much to the annoyance of his co-producer and the TV executives.  They couldn't do anything, as McGoohan had complete control.  The subconscious underpinnings of the years leading up to the Prisoner seem to emerge as pieces of a twisted media mind-game.  Is he messing with us because we messed with him?  The show very quickly became about McGoohan's fight against his public image (how a good-looking face becomes associated with so many positive concepts, whether or not its true of the person), the constant pressure of fame, loss of privacy, and continual nagging demand to know his ""reasons"" for his decisions (for not doing Bond, for not continuing Secret Agent, etc.), and the subconscious hypnotism/supplication each of us must fight everyday.When a person is literally ""in the spotlight"" they see the world from within a bubble.  It is, therefore, no coincidence that the concept of the ""eye"" is so important to the world of The Village.  The eye is a ball that perceives objects upside down and backwards.  Our brains then translate these images automatically and we percieve them as normal ... but does our subconscious mind fully understand what is happening?  Since, one question that seems to be central to the piece is the psychological concept of authority, is it not unreasonable to ask ""why do we allow people into our heads and assume they are our betters?""  The Butler who never speaks, but answers to the ""authority"" of the moment.  He is the real ""everyman.""  Number 2 is always different, but always the authority figure (only answerable to an unseen Number 1.)  He or she is seated in a half-circle chair, generally facing away from Number 6, which then rotates back to face him.  This could represent the mind's way of percieving another human being and accepting that person as mentally superior.  The Boss.  The message is obvious and yet completely subtle:  everyday the mind subconsciously let's go of personal individuality by believing that another human being is in anyway superior.  The person in question can range anywhere from a parent, school teacher, boss, politician, King, or even Pope.  Sometimes they are merely ""emotionally"" manipulative, as in ""The Girl Who was Death.""  The point seem to be the moment the individual loses control to another human being.  And, worse, it isn't the obvious acts that are the most dangerous.  The world is conditioning the mind to behave.The eye percieves all of this and the brain translates it.  If you accept this, you'll find that it is no coincidence that the revelation of Number 1 should come through the a crystal ball.  (no spoilers.)In short, this show will force you to think.  If you refuse to think, you will probably still find it a wild ride.  Only the few, the weak, will dislike it because they are too mentally lazy to work out the finer points.  But, then again, ""One must either be hammer or anvil.""",5,What's it all about?,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,7248,"['DVD', 'overview', 'Well', 'are', 'excellent', 'transfers', 'Visually', 'as',

668845,A129YBX5BVNW2,B00005NKCQ,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[2, 2]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ""UK"" BLU RAY ISSUE - ""US"" BUYERS WILL REQUIRE AN ALL-REGIONS PLAYER ***When the 1st episode of ""The Prisoner"" was aired by ITV in September 1967 in the UK (June 1968 in the USA by CBS), ""Sgt. Peppers"" was still at number one and the Summer of Love was in full swing. All things seemed possible - and at the same time - with the Vietnam War, Race Riots and the escalation of Government control over personal lives - many things seemed slightly sinister too...Enter into this volatile soup the cocky and charismatic actor Patrick McGoohan fresh from his global TV success as John Drake in ""Danger Man"". The distinctly voiced actor (born in New York, but raised in Ireland and Britain) had a mind-bending idea for a new ""spy"" TV series limited to only 7 episodes. ""The Village"" would be a self-contained world where no one had a name but a number - and would act as a sort of containment home for retired secret agents that big-brother Government wanted to control and keep an eye on. Each week would see a new Number 2 trying to crack Number 6 (McGoohan) through ever more elaborate means. Escape was curtailed by a blob that chased you called ""Rover"" which suffocated its victims. The futility of even 'trying' to escape was reinforced by the insidious repetition of phrases like ""be seeing you"" - an early version of word-play and spin-doctors playing us. It was a brilliant pitch and Lew Grade (head of Independent Television) thought it was ""...crazy enough that it might just work..."". But come February 1968 when the 17th truly-out-there ""Fall Out"" episode was finally aired (some saying it made little sense), McGoohan was on the defensive and practically being run out of his own country by angry and confused fans... How utterly cool!First to the details - UK-released on BLU RAY in September 2009 (Oct 2009 in the USA with different packaging) - this UK-only packaging is a box-of-chocolates shaped set with two compartments - the first contains a near-300 page paperback book entitled ""The Prisoner - A Complete Production Guide"" by ANDREW PIXLEY. It was originally produced exclusively for NETWORK and their 2007 remastered DVD box and is reprinted here; the second inset has a 6-disc BLU RAY clip box (each disc features a different picture).  Discs 1 to 4 contains all 17 episodes - the complete series and each episode with its own special features. Discs 5 and 6 have staggering amounts of further extras including input from those involved, previously unseen behind-the-scenes footage, a different version of ""Arrival"" and several commentaries by the production crew. It's exhaustive stuff.While the paperback is fan-obsessed with details and a truly informative account, it is completely devoid of any photographs, which I feel is not just disappointing, but does this otherwise fantastic presentation a major disservice. While there are loads of pictures on Disc 6 (in High Def) and fabulous complimentary features too - it would have been nice to trawl over a really good book featuring photos of those superb production values. No disrespect to the author whose work here is incredible and must have taken years of research, it's just that all words and no visual make it a very dry read (probably too cost-prohibitive).But that minor niggle quickly pales into insignificance once your eyes see the frame-by-frame fully restored 35mm print. Presented in 1:33:1 aspect and filling the full screen - it is ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS TO LOOK AT - and puts many a modern production to shame. I noticed maybe only one or two occasions where the image had lines or some other stock fault - for 98% of the time, the digitally restored high definition print is faultless and a constant joy and revelation to look at.Filmed in a real-life folly called Portmeirion in Gwynedd in Wales (fans still visit the town in Prisoner regalia), the entire seaside town was the dream of architect Clough Williams-Ellis who purchased the peninsula in 1923 and began building his own Mediterranean village there complete with an English twist. Portmeirion had in fact featured in previous ""Danger Man"" episodes and McGoohan and his family had often holidayed there. With a budget of 50,000-per-episode, a large uniquely clothed cast of extras and an entire town bathed in summer sunshine to play with, the extraordinary location and production values collided to produce a vision that stuns to this day.The clarity is AWESOME... There's a scene in Episode 1 ""Arrival"" where McGoohan is offered a chair in Number Two's lair - a hole in the floor slides across and up pops a stool - but this time you can clearly see that the hole is cardboard - and not steel. In Episode 2 ""The Chimes Of Big Ben"" when Nadia Gray wakes up as Number 8, you can see her hair is immaculate and her eyelids are heavily pasted in blue makeup...  (the episode also features Finlay Currie as the General who was Magwitch the Convict in David Lean's masterpiece ""Great Expectations"")  - and on it goes!I've reviewed quite a few superlative restorations before this - ""North By Northwest"", ""The Italian Job"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Saturday Night, Sunday Morning"" and ""The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner"" (see reviews for all), but this takes the gong.""The Prisoner"" on BLU RAY is bound to make many fans go weak at the knees and will hopefully draw in a new generation of lovers for one of the most extraordinary television programs ever made.In the 90-minute extra ""Don't Knock Yourself Out"" actors, producers and writers described McGoohan on set in 1967 as charismatic, brilliant and a visionary - while others like Leo McKern and one particularly embittered actress loathed the man to the point of distraction - calling him monster, maniacal, brutish and a bully. He was undoubtedly the whole lot. And like William Shatner and his 'big role', Captain Kirk from Star Trek, McGoohan had an equally spiky relationship with the character and TV series that both defined and pigeonholed him for decades. Still - you can't help but feel that Patrick is up there right now (whatever mood he's in) beaming down at this wonderful box set.Is ""Number 1"" that part of you that capitulates - as McGoohan seems to suggest when one of the masks is unveiled in ""Fall Out""? I don't know. But that's what ""The Prisoner"" is like - even after more than four decades - it's still thought provoking, wildly imaginative and stunningly relevant - especially on the core subjects of individual freedom and Governmental control.And now on BLU RAY it has the box set it has always deserved.For me - this is Reissue of the Year.",5,"""...We Have A Citizen's Advice Bureau Up There...They're Very

The prints are absolutely pristine.  In terms of the mythology of the show, the debate has gone on for over 40 years as to its meaning and most importantly-------Is Number 6 John Drake?  Having watched ""Secret Agent""--which was the U.S. version of the one hour Danger Man episodes, I am convinced that Drake is Number 6.  In fact, Script Editor on the show (and also involved with Danger Man), George Markstein confirms this.  Because McGoohan's production company did not own the rights to the John Drake name, ""The Prisoner"" could hardly overtly make the connection.But if you are a true Danger Man and Prisoner fan---the connection is there.  The Prisoner is considered the final season of Danger Man by many of us lifelong fans.What I did not understand as a 15 year old during The Prisoner's original run is the real meanings behind the show.

It looks as if it could have been filmed now. The vibrant hues of the 60's come to life with a BANG!I own a lot of sci-fi, high budget special effects movies on blu-ray and none of them are as impressive as The Prisoner is on blu-ray.

I've seen it on broadcast, VHS, and DVD and I can tell you it's NEVER looked this good. I'm sorry to gush so much about this, but I can't overstate how amazing the transfer is.I have always found The Prisoner to be a show that I can regularly re-watch and always find some new bit of philosophical treasure. Having owned this in all its available incarnations and having seen it more times than I can count, I thought I'd seen it all. However, the blu-ray transfer is so crystal clear, I've seen things in the background that I'd never noticed before. Signs, newspapers, products in the village store, nuances that give the show another layer of depth.

(&#34;Paranoia strikes deep.  Into your life it will creep.  It starts when you're always afraid.  Step out of line, the man come, and take you away.&#34;)  Yes, the writing, acting and production values are excellent.  Yes, the resort village of Portmeirion in North Wales is the perfect setting for the show.  Yes, the video quality of the Blu-ray version is spectacular.  Yes, adding everything up, including the bonus features, I heartily recommend buying &#34;The Prisoner.&#34;  However, I can't give this series the five star rating I fully expected to give it.  The problem I have is with the series final episode, entitled &#34;Fall Out.&#34; In that episode, the orderly village is replaced by an underground cavern of chaos and craziness.  The insanity reaches a fever pitch when the viewer finally gets a glimpse of Number 1. (&#34;Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.&#34;)  The problems with that episode were made clear in the documentary about the series, entitled &#34;Don't Knock Yourself Out.&#34;Patrick McGoohan promised ITC executive Sir Lew Grade (who appears in the documentary) that he would come up with two seasons of thirteen episodes each of &#34;The Prisoner.&#34;  Whether the concept couldn't sustain another 13 episodes, or whether Patrick lost interest in the series, the fact remains that only four more episodes of &#34;The Prisoner&#34; were broadcast in the second season.  In fact, after the first season's thirteen episodes were broadcast, Patrick left to appear in the 1968 movie &#34;Ice Station Zebra.&#34;  In the second season episode &#34;Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling,&#34; Number 6's mind is transferred into another man's body.  Thus, Nigel Stock portrayed Number 6 for most of that episode, while Patrick was away filming the movie.  Patrick McGoohan had to write the show's final episode in a hurry, and I believe it shows.

Buying the whole thing is a little expensive, but it's still the most cost-effective way...The show itself is at the summit of television art. Kitchy 60's set designs, first-class performances, and a heady sense of intrigue, mystery, and abstraction are some of the defining features of the show. There isn't a friend I've shared this series with that hasn't been totally entertained by it and wanted to see the whole thing. And I run with a pretty diverse crew.Praise aside, some people have told me they would have prefered to see more continuity between the episodes and some were dissatisfied or confused with the conclusion. Personally, I like it just the way it is- with more questions raised than answered.Let's face it, this is one of those larger purchases and you shouldn't shell out the money without trying it out to see if you like it. If you're looking for a gift for a young man who's a little on the geeky side (enjoys books and movies), then this is a pretty safe bet.This show tried concepts which had never been used before- i.e. a hero who's as likely to fail as to succeed in every episode (a far cry from other cult series like, say, Highlander- where the hero's safety is always assured). You could say it was way ahead of its time, but I think it came exactly when we needed it (though it was 10 years before I was born).The DVDs themselves are very light on extras. Trailers for the episodes, two interviews with Bernie Williams, the production manager, and a video companion which was less than elucidating. Sound and vision are fine, except for the alternate verison of ""The Chimes Of Big Ben"". I could barely hear the audio, even with the sound all the way up, but it's not that important. The stories are what counts here, but some more extras would've been nice, especially if they could've gotten something out of McGoohan himself- no easy task there, so, the complaint is nit-picking...If you like art and action, this show's for you.

Mind you, given the crazy, whacked-out, psychedelic finale, CAN you give the ending away?

I'm not sure, so I'll just make a few observations and leave it up to you to decide if you want to go along for the ride.In my view, The Prisoner, more than any other show or film, succeeded in creating it's own perfect reality and internal logic. The ""village"" itself, the numbers, the mind-numbing musak, the cheery announcements, the ""Tally Ho,"" the ever changing No.2, and of course, the ever present ""Rover.""Of all the iconic images in the show, McGoohan striding down the tunnel on his way to resign, driving home in his Lotus 7 and being stalked by the hearse, the Penny Farthing bicycles, the Mini Moke taxi's, the ""groovy"" 60's atmosphere, costumes and music - Austin Powers wasn't even close! - the crazy seesaw spinning endlessly in the Control Room, the Supervisor intoning ""Orange Alert,"" it's ""Rover"" that leaves an indelible mark. What the Hell is it?! Is it alive, is it mechanical, is it both?!?!?! I dunno, but I certainly wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night in Portmeirion... I wouldn't even want to tangle with the ""Baby Rovers"" that appear in a couple of episodes!I saw The Prisoner, as a child, when it was first broadcast back in the late 60's, in Dear Old Blighty. I didn't have a clue as to what was going on, but it was weird, immediately grabbed my attention, and fired my imagination! Seeing it again over the years, and finally buying it on video, I started to see deeper into the story, and formed an even greater appreciation for what McGoohan had achieved.As far as the ""order"" debate is concerned, I think this 10 DVD set has got it just about right. No.6 mentions in a few episodes that he's ""new here,"" or he's only ""just arrived,"" these episodes have been moved 'up' in the running order, which makes perfect sense. And when you view the set as a whole, you now see the methods used to try and break No.6 growing more extreme and desperate as the series continues, 'til they culminate in the psychological battle that is ""Once Upon A Time,"" again, a perfectly logical progression.As far as my own personal favorite episodes are concerned, I would go with...ARRIVAL: It sets the whole thing up!FREE FOR ALL: Love that line, ""Obey me and be free!""A, B, & C: Gotta love the ""... groovy party!"" and the scene near the end where No.6 walks into the ""treatment room"" in his dream, and No.2 and No.48 spin around to look at the door behind them as it opens and closes on the screen in front of them!CHECKMATE: Poor No.6, was he a little too clever for his own good this time?THE CHIMES OF BIG BEN: Or should that be ""Big Bill?"" I enjoy this one specifically because of the interplay between No.6 and No.2, played by the wonderful Leo McKern.THE SCHIZOID MAN: Two No.6's for the price of one, and the only episode where ""Rover"" is mentioned by name.HAMMER INTO ANVIL: It's such fun watching No.2 lose the plot, an incredible, scenery chewing, Patrick Cargill.LIVING IN HARMONY: A ""psychedelic"" western, man!ONCE UPON A TIME: A breathtaking battle of wills between No.6 and No.2, once again played to perfection by Leo McKern!The Prisoner is unique amongst television shows, it was a product of, and a comment on, its time... and ours. An examination of the Human Condition, of the individuals right to BE an individual, within a conformist Society.It entertains, it mystifies, it challenges.

I never thought it could look so good.  I'm constantly pausing the show to enjoy the image.The stereo sound is another matter.  Right during part 2 of the opening,  (""Where am I?"" ""In the Village.""), I hear that remastered sound ""anomaly"" that plagues restored movies.  When the Rover bubble comes up, there's a swooshing, swirling, muddy sound like it was played in a revolving cylinder.  I noticed it again in ""The Chimes Of Big Ben"" when Number 6 starts putting the radio speaker into the small fridge.  When I went to the mono track, the sound was back to normal.  Thank you, A&E;, for keeping that option!  I'm sticking with mono from now on.That swirly sound in DVD movies is most often heard during explosions.  It bugs the heck out of me.  If the sound engineers can't improve a sound, why don't they just leave it alone?  I'm only running this through a home stereo, so I don't know if a fancy 3.1 or 5.1 audio setup would correct this.The only other quibble is why the episode theme is so much louder than the rest of the show.  I love the theme music, but why the difference?  (I've only watched ""The Chimes Of Big Ben"" so far).In summary, it's a great product.  Okay, one more quibble.  Why did they change the logo?  I love the Prisoner typeface, so why remove the eyecatching original?  To make it like the remake, I suppose.  The same is true of the Mission: Impossible DVDs and the Invaders DVD sets.  (I had a hard time finding The Invaders set on the shelf because the title style was so bland).",4,"Great Picture, Sound Quibbles",1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,1602,"['just', 'got', 'set', 'right', 'away', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'picture', 'great', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'look', 'so', 'good', ""'m"", 'constantly', 'pausing', 'show', 'enjoy', 'image.The', 'stereo', 'sound', 'matter', 'Right', 'part', '2', 'opening', 'Where', 'am', 'Village', 'hear', 'remastered', 'sound', 'anomaly', 'restored', 'movies', 'When', 'Rover', 'bubble', 'up', 'swooshing', 'swirling', 'muddy', 'sound', 'was', 'played', 'revolving', 'cylinder', 'noticed', 'again', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'when', 'Number', '6', 'starts', 'putting', 'radio', 'speaker', 'small', 'fridge', 'When', 'went', 'mono', 'track', 'sound', 'was', 'back', 'normal', 'Thank', 'A', 'E', 'keeping', 'option', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'mono', 'now', 'swirly', 'sound', 'DVD', 'movies', 'most', 'often', 'heard', 'explosions', 'bugs', 'heck', 'sound', 'engineers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'improve', 'sound', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'leave', 'alone', ""'m"", 'only', 'running', 'home', 'stereo', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fancy', '3.1', '5.1', 'audio', 'setup', 'would', 'correct', 'only', 'other', 'quibble', 'why', 'episode', 'theme', 'so', 'much', 'louder', 'rest', 'show', 'love', 'theme', 'music', 'why', 'difference', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'so', 'far', '.In', 'summary', 'great', 'product', 'Okay', 'one', 'more', 'quibble', 'Why', 'did', 'change', 'logo', 'love', 'Prisoner', 'typeface', 'so', 'why', 'remove', 'eyecatching', 'original', 'make', 'remake', 'suppose', 'same', 'true', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'DVDs', 'Invaders', 'DVD', 'sets', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'Invaders', 'set', 'shelf', 'title', 'style', 'was', 'so', 'bland']",N/A

The underlying issues that were so ingeniously covered in several of the storylines of Mr.McGoohan's ""Masterpiece"" are absolutely factual, occurring in reality, and unfortunately are happening in our ""Courts of Law"" and in our ""Government"" to this very day, (Trust me - I know whereof I speak!) And upon revisting ""No.6"", and ""The New No.2"", and ""The Village"" many years later, after similarly nightmarish experiences I've had recently, both the cleverly hidden messages and the overt morality plays smacked me right in the face, and I finally ""got it""! And I'm not talking about getting the ridiculously obvious clues as to who ""No.6"" is, (""D-6?""), or what it really means when ""Drake"" asks his captors ""Who is number one?"", (the ""Ratings Game"", the ""TV Industry"", and an illogically placed ""Camera Crane"" in the middle of the ""Green Dome"" all scream that the whole thing is going on inside a man's mind... Patrick McGoohan's mind, in fact... The ""TV Actor & Star"" in particular!) What I'm talking about was lost on the young man I used to be when I saw ""The Prisoner"" as a Sci-Fi/Spy series like others made by ITC, the same people responsible for the fab, fun, flighty adventures of ""The Saint"" and ""The Avengers"". This time around I ""got it"" with regards to the meaning of things like first learning to ""distinguish between the blacks and the whites"" in a ""life-size chessboard"", and the true costs of being a ""free man"", who is ""free to speak"", and who now feels more strongly than ever that ""My life is my own!"" This strange old ""Cult TV Series"" alone has provided me with more hope, and confidence, and inspiration to be strong and to keep on fighting for my ""inalienable"" rights and ethical goals, and when necessary, being totally ""unmutual"" in the process of revolting in my own ""rage against the machine"" than had a thousand written quotations from many of the finest ""minds"" the world, (we know of), has ever known. And as such, I would not only have to, but would WANT to include Patrick McGoohan among the likes of Albert Einstein, Martin Luther King, Jr., and all the other Poets, Prophets, and Proletariats who once stood up for the ""rights of the little man"", (The Butler?), and the ""freedoms"" every man needs yet takes for granted on a daily basis, (""Everyman Films, Ltd.""?), and tried drawing some attention to all the moral values of a ""civilized society"" that have been systematically tossed by the wayside in an un-concious, technology obsessed, fast-food culture which has grown so cold-hearted, self-interested, profit-based, and vainglorious it has all of us turning a ""mutual"" blind eye to injustices occurring around us every day! And in such a ""Village"" as the one we've created for ourselves it's very nice and truly fortunate to have once had a quirky little series on the tellie with a heart, a soul, and a ""mind"" - God bless you, Paddy Fitz!

Great concept, suspense, action, adventure and topped off with the examination of one's identity and how important it is. This series was magnificently crafted all the way until the last episode or two, when McGoohan either decided to drop acid and cop out on the ending OR didn't HAVE an ending so he decided to go insane and figured the more sychophantic viewers out there would compensate by making their own ending and fill in the gaps of what became a silly, nonsensical, disorganized mish-mash of a finale. A shame they ended it as they did because it was a top notch sci-fi thriller until the penultimate episode.

Who,if anyone,is working in my best interests? Who is the real enemy ?All these questions and so many,many more are touched on throughout this rollercoaster ride with the protagonist.His search is our search and as many questions as he raises,they spawn many more.I could go on and on but if you have not seen this series I will leave its' interpretations to you......because yours is as valid as any others.And this is what Patrick McGoohan had in mind I suspect right from the start.And this is what makes this arguably the best and smartest show ever to grace the TV airwaves.It may have debuted 40 years ago this year but it has lost NONE of its' impact or appeal.In fact I daresay it has MORE to say to us than ever before.",4,Even dressing is an act of defiance!,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,3957,"['So', 'new', 'number', 'Two', 'early', 'episode', 'Prisoner', 'watching', 'getting', 'ready', 'new', 'day', 'Village.By', 'way', 'following', 'review', '40th', 'Anniversary', 'Collectors', 'Edition', 'Prisoner.This', '10', 'DVD', 'set', 'contains', 'many', 'extras', 'include', 'following', '-Rare', '8mm', '16mm', 'colour', 'footage', 'Prisoner', 'location', '1966-A', '50', 'minute', 'special', 'Prisoner', 'Video', 'Companion', '-the', 'alternate', 'version', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', '-rare', 'foreign', 'file', 'cabinet', 'intro', 'outro', 'footage-all', 'production', 'series', 'trailers-picture', 'galleries', 'eps', '/67', 'press', 'conference-interactive', 'map', 'Village-lots', 'trivia-a', 'fold', 'map', 'Village-a', 'wonderful', 'interview', 'production', 'manager', 'series-and', '60', 'page', 'illustrated', 'booklet', 'containing', 'synopses', 'episodes', 'many', 'other', 'bits', 'Prisoner', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'are', 'interviews', 'cast', 'including', 'Mr.McGoohan', 'who', 'conspicuous', 'absence', 'are', 'many', 'quotes', 'visually', 'print', 'him.Each', 'ten', 'discs', 'come', 'slim', 'slipcase', 'annotated', 'info', 'ep', 'scene', 'factoids', 'info', 'order', 'debate.With', 'regards', 'latter', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'had', 'series', 'been', 'released', 'original', 'order', 'was', 'back', '/67', 'more', 'fan', 'friendly', 'version', 'set', 'means', 'perfect', '.Now', '/67', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'series', 'just', 'considered', 'giant', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle.All', 'pieces', 'were', 'scattered', 'table', 'one', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'time', 'picture', 'would', 'reveal', 'itself.I', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'Mr.McGoohan', 'had', 'reason', 'releasing', 'manner', 'least', 'are', 'here', 'enjoy', 'way', 'feel', 'seeing', 'picture', 'quality', 'slightly', 'weaker', 'earlier', 'eps', 'later', 'ones', 'more', 'defects', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'digital', 'shimmering', 'evidence.In', 'fact', 'alternate', 'Chimes', 'ep', 'not', 'good', 'condition', '.dirty', 'blemished', 'colour', 'faded', 'terrible', 'sound', 'suspect', 'little', 'was', 'done', 'one', 'least', 'fortunate', 'still', 'have', 'today', 'comparison', 'purposes', 'nothing', 'else.The', 'show', 'probably', 'know', 'now', 'agent', 'arguably', 'John', 'Drake', 'aka', 'Danger/Secret', 'Agent', 'man', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'taken', 'place', 'called', 'Village.Here', 'daily', 'physical', 'especially', 'mental', 'travails', 'captors', 'order', 'extract', 'reason', 's', 'resignation', 'other', 'pertinent', 'information', 'thereof.The', 'show', 'just', 'conceivable', 'discipline', 'human', 'beings', 'world', 'condition', 'be', 'past', 'present', 'future.It', 'was', 'series', 'produced', 'conceived', 'fertile', 'wonderful', 'mind', 'star', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'astoundingly', 'much', 'was', 'filmed', 'fly', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'talented', 'crew', 'cast', 'members.It', 'good', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'down', 'second', 'lest', 'miss', 'little', 'juicy', 'tidbit', 'information', 'special', 'nuance', 'subtle', 'sub-text.Through', 'come', 'question', 'own', 'condition', 'one', 'granted', 'lives.Freedom', 'Reality', 'are', 'Who', 'anyone', 'working', 'best', 'interests', 'Who', 'real', 'enemy', 'questions', 'so', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'are', 'touched', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'protagonist.His', 'search', 'search', 'many', 'questions', 'spawn', 'many', 'more.I', 'could', 'go', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'series', 'will', 'leave', 'interpretations', 'yours', 'as', 'valid', 'others.And', 'what', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'had', 'mind', 'suspect', 'right', 'start.And', 'what', 'arguably', 'best', 'smartest', 'show', 'ever', 'grace', 'TV', 'airwaves.It', 'may', 'have', 'debuted', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'year', 'lost', 'NONE', 'impact', 'appeal.In', 'fact', 'daresay', 'MORE', 'say', 'ever']",N/A
668874,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00005NKCQ,Robert J. Crawford,"[3, 10]","Over 40 years ago, I remember my excitement at the weirdness of this show, which in the common culture of TV, ALL of my friends were watching and would discuss it in childhood awe. McGoohan was dashingly handsome, string, subtle, and convincing. The atmosphere and feeling of the show was downright surreal, even 60s psychedelic. It was up there, in my mind, with Star Trek, but extra-intriguing because it seemed that something unbelievably mysterious was happening that someday I would understand. Since then, I have remembered images from it, which titillated my imagination and kept my wanting to see it again.Well, to re-live my childhood and finally ""get it"", I bought this and started watching it with my kids. We were immediately struck by how boring and humdrum many of the shows were - so much so, that after rolling their eyes when dad put it on subsequent episodes, the kids often refused to watch it with me later. For my part, I was looking for themes and clues, hoping to figure it out, to interpret it, to seek patterns that would live on in my imagination, which is a big part of the fun of hard science fiction for me. Not only did I detect little coherence between episodes, but there was little build up in terms of what was advancing as a plot. For example, he escapes and returns with the aid of his old colleagues - having figured out it was somewhere off of Spain? - but none of that whatsoever is taken up in the final episode. My greatest disappointment was that the last episode in fact explains nothing, though he earns his release.So far as I can see, there are a number of interpretations. 1) it is a global subversive organization (like, say Specter) that is trying to control the minds of spies and politicians in a number of countries in order to gain power. 2) it is all controlled by a single government, perhaps totalitarian, perhaps democratic or even British, that is running an operation to find out what is dangerous in the agent or agents that are chosen to live there or to brainwash them for further service. 3) it is in his mind alone and so is a kind of solipsistic insanity or merely a reflection of a reality. 4) some combination thereof, via drugs, torture, psychological pressure, that warps his mind into hallucinations combined with reality, though the border is never defined.I suppose the lack of certainty could be a plus, but only if it is fun to watch.  Unfortunately, it is not.  Indeed, I found myself wishing that the episodes would end, rather than savoring the viewing experience. The only thing that kept me going was that I wanted to figure it out, which ultimately I couldn't.I am sorry to say that I would not recommend this for anyone other than fanatical fans who would like it no matter what. This is a surprising conclusion for me, because I have added Star Trek, Star Trek The Next Generation, the original The Outer Limits, and the (Emma Peel) Avengers to our collection and everyone has found something in them to enjoy.  It will not live on in my imagination, so in a way I lost something by watching it again.",3,"An extremely disappointing re-viewing, as an adult",1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,3083,"['40', 'years', 'ago', 'remember', 'excitement', 'weirdness', 'show', 'common', 'culture', 'TV', 'ALL', 'friends', 'were', 'watching', 'would', 'discuss', 'childhood', 'awe', 'McGoohan', 'was', 'dashingly', 'handsome', 'string', 'subtle', 'convincing', 'atmosphere', 'feeling', 'show', 'was', 'downright', 'surreal', 'even', '60s', 'psychedelic', 'was', 'up', 'there', 'mind', 'Star', 'Trek', 'extra-intriguing', 'seemed', 'something', 'unbelievably', 'mysterious', 'was', 'happening', 'someday', 'would', 'understand', 'then', 'have', 'remembered', 'images', 'titillated', 'imagination', 'kept', 'wanting', 'see', 'again.Well', 're-live', 'childhood', 'finally', 'get', 'bought', 'started', 'watching', 'kids', 'were', 'immediately', 'struck', 'how', 'boring', 'humdrum', 'many', 'shows', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'when', 'dad', 'put', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'kids', 'often', 'refused', 'watch', 'later', 'part', 'was', 'looking', 'themes', 'clues', 'hoping', 'figure', 'out', 'interpret', 'seek', 'patterns', 'would', 'live', 'imagination', 'big', 'part', 'fun', 'hard', 'science', 'fiction', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'detect', 'little', 'coherence', 'episodes', 'was', 'little', 'build', 'up', 'terms', 'what', 'was', 'advancing', 'plot', 'example', 'returns', 'aid', 'old', 'colleagues', 'having', 'figured', 'was', 'somewhere', 'Spain', 'none', 'whatsoever', 'taken', 'up', 'final', 'episode', 'greatest', 'disappointment', 'was', 'last', 'episode', 'fact', 'explains', 'nothing', 'release.So', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'number', 'interpretations', '1', 'global', 'subversive', 'organization', 'say', 'Specter', 'trying', 'control', 'minds', 'spies', 'politicians', 'number', 'countries', 'order', 'gain', 'power', '2', 'controlled', 'single', 'government', 'perhaps', 'totalitarian', 'perhaps', 'democratic', 'even', 'British', 'running', 'operation', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'dangerous', 'agent', 'agents', 'are', 'chosen', 'live', 'there', 'brainwash', 'further', 'service', '3', 'mind', 'alone', 'so', 'kind', 'solipsistic', 'insanity', 'merely', 'reflection', 'reality', '4', 'combination', 'thereof', 'drugs', 'torture', 'psychological', 'pressure', 'mind', 'hallucinations', 'combined', 'reality', 'border', 'never', 'defined.I', 'suppose', 'lack', 'certainty', 'could', 'be', 'plus', 'only', 'fun', 'watch', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'Indeed', 'found', 'wishing', 'episodes', 'would', 'end', 'rather', 'savoring', 'viewing', 'experience', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'going', 'was', 'wanted', 'figure', 'out', 'ultimately', ""couldn't.I"", 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'other', 'fanatical', 'fans', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'matter', 'what', 'surprising', 'conclusion', 'have', 'added', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'original', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Emma', 'Peel', 'Avengers', 'collection', 'everyone', 'found', 'something', 'enjoy', 'will', 'not', 'live', 'imagination', 'so', 'way', 'lost', 'something', 'watching', 'again']",N/A
668875,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005NKCQ,Robert Moore,"[22, 22]","Even today, THE PRISONER stands out as of the most remarkable achievements in the history of television.  It is so unique that it can't be said to have been influenced by any other show and so inimitable that it really hasn't inspired copies.  One can only approximate THE PRISONER by imitating it.  I think there is little doubt that whatever television shows from the 20th century are still being viewed in the 22nd, THE PRISONER will undoubtedly be among their number, and even then viewers will watch it with surprise and wonder.THE PRISONER is entirely the vision of star Patrick McGoohan.  Any fan of the show knows that the American-born actor had previously been the star of the 1950s British spy show DANGER MAN, later renamed SECRET AGENT MAN when it was renewed during the James Bond mania of the 1960s.  It has been widely debated whether Number Six of THE PRISONER was John Drake, McGoohan's character in SECRET AGENT MAN.  I definitely take the position that he was.  The one thing that is beyond question is that it was from first to last McGoohan's show.  He created and developed the concept, wrote a substantial amount of the series, directed many of the episodes, and oversaw all creative aspects of the show, all while, of course, starring in it.  In fact, he performed so many key tasks on the series that he began disguising some of them by using aliases so that his name wouldn't show up so often on the credits.More than anything, THE PRISONER was McGoohan's attempt to make a set of comments on what he saw as the lingering insistence on social and political control that society was attempting to exert in limiting individualism and freedom of expression.  In that sense, he fit quite easily with other sixties radicals who were if not actively calling for a revolution at least expressing a wish for it.  Number Six has been imprisoned because he wanted to quit being a spy and wanted to get away from that and find a new mode of life (just before being imprisoned--a scene we see repeated each week in the credits--we see the travel brochures of the tropical beach he is obviously yearning for).  Like Thoreau, Number Six finds a host of ways to reassert his individuality, and refuses to conform regardless of the pressure exerted.If Thoreau provides the political context, Kafka provides the nightmare.  Indeed, the show as a whole reads like Thoreau meets James Bond meets Kafka meets Salad Days, with the weird, strange, surreal pseudo-Edwardian Village serving as Number Six's prison.  It is an amazingly personal and powerful vision.  What is amazing is how potent the series has remained, even as it nears its fortieth anniversary.  Despite some dated stylistic touches and regardless of the primitiveness of some of the special effects, the show still feels contemporary.  One feels that McGoohan has hit upon something universal.The care that went into the series is obvious throughout.  For instance, to this day perhaps no show, whether series or mini series, has employed so many camera set ups.  There are scenes in which Number Six will walk two hundred yards that might employ a few dozen camera shots.  Simply walking up a spiral staircase might use ten or twelve.  Nothing like this had never been seen before, and certainly has never been seen since.  The quality is part of the reason that even today in many polls of the top series of all time, THE PRISONER is frequently acknowledged.  It will long remain one of the more singular achievements of the medium.",5,A remarkably unique and imaginative TV masterpiece,1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,3507,"['Even', 'today', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'out', 'most', 'remarkable', 'achievements', 'history', 'television', 'so', 'unique', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'other', 'show', 'so', 'inimitable', 'really', ""n't"", 'inspired', 'copies', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'approximate', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'imitating', 'think', 'little', 'doubt', 'television', 'shows', '20th', 'century', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'viewed', '22nd', 'PRISONER', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'number', 'even', 'then', 'viewers', 'will', 'watch', 'surprise', 'wonder.THE', 'PRISONER', 'entirely', 'vision', 'star', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'Any', 'fan', 'show', 'American-born', 'actor', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'star', '1950s', 'British', 'spy', 'show', 'DANGER', 'MAN', 'later', 'renamed', 'SECRET', 'AGENT', 'MAN', 'when', 'was', 'renewed', 'James', 'Bond', 'mania', '1960s', 'been', 'widely', 'debated', 'Number', 'Six', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'was', 'John', 'Drake', 'McGoohan', 'character', 'SECRET', 'AGENT', 'MAN', 'definitely', 'take', 'position', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'question', 'was', 'first', 'last', 'McGoohan', 'show', 'created', 'developed', 'concept', 'wrote', 'substantial', 'amount', 'series', 'directed', 'many', 'episodes', 'creative', 'aspects', 'show', 'course', 'starring', 'fact', 'performed', 'so', 'many', 'key', 'tasks', 'series', 'began', 'disguising', 'using', 'aliases', 'so', 'name', 'would', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'so', 'often', 'credits.More', 'anything', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'was', 'McGoohan', 'attempt', 'make', 'set', 'comments', 'what', 'saw', 'lingering', 'insistence', 'social', 'political', 'control', 'society', 'was', 'attempting', 'exert', 'limiting', 'individualism', 'freedom', 'expression', 'sense', 'fit', 'quite', 'easily', 'other', 'sixties', 'radicals', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'actively', 'calling', 'revolution', 'least', 'expressing', 'wish', 'Number', 'Six', 'been', 'imprisoned', 'wanted', 'quit', 'being', 'spy', 'wanted', 'get', 'away', 'find', 'new', 'mode', 'life', 'just', 'being', 'imprisoned', 'scene', 'see', 'repeated', 'week', 'credits', 'see', 'travel', 'brochures', 'tropical', 'beach', 'obviously', 'yearning', 'Thoreau', 'Number', 'Six', 'host', 'ways', 'reassert', 'individuality', 'conform', 'regardless', 'pressure', 'Thoreau', 'political', 'context', 'Kafka', 'nightmare', 'Indeed', 'show', 'whole', 'reads', 'Thoreau', 'meets', 'James', 'Bond', 'meets', 'Kafka', 'meets', 'Salad', 'Days', 'weird', 'strange', 'surreal', 'pseudo-Edwardian', 'Village', 'serving', 'Number', 'Six', 'prison', 'amazingly', 'personal', 'powerful', 'vision', 'What', 'amazing', 'how', 'potent', 'series', 'remained', 'even', 'fortieth', 'anniversary', 'dated', 'stylistic', 'touches', 'regardless', 'primitiveness', 'special', 'effects', 'show', 'still', 'feels', 'contemporary', 'One', 'McGoohan', 'hit', 'something', 'universal.The', 'care', 'went', 'series', 'obvious', 'instance', 'day', 'perhaps', 'show', 'series', 'mini', 'series', 'employed', 'so', 'many', 'camera', 'set', 'ups', 'are', 'scenes', 'Number', 'Six', 'will', 'walk', 'two', 'hundred', 'yards', 'might', 'employ', 'few', 'dozen', 'camera', 'shots', 'Simply', 'walking', 'up', 'spiral', 'staircase', 'might', 'use', 'ten', 'twelve', 'Nothing', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'certainly', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'quality', 'part', 'reason', 'even', 'today', 'many', 'polls', 'top', 'series', 'time', 'PRISONER', 'frequently', 'acknowledged', 'will', 'long', 'remain', 'one', 'more', 'singular', 'achievements', 'medium']",N/A

I have always liked Patrick McGoohan but in this movie I thought he was a real wierdo!! I don't even remember how he gets to this picture perfect village community.(that's how much I was falling asleep in the first few minutes) - this  community where everyone is called by a number - no names and not much loving going on either. I will say the apartments which were not called apartments were quite nice so at least the 'prisoners' lived well.  There was some good stuff where Patrick tried to get away from this really NOT so picture perfect community but failed in all attempts; those were the highlights of the Prisoner.  The first three-fourths of the movie held my attention  and I liked it, however all of a sudden it got really creepy and stupid and I did a lot of fast forwarding closer to the end which was also a little weird.  Don't get this movie if you're getting it just because you like Patrick (that's what I did).  I didn't recognize any of the other British actors and normally I don't get British films because they have such a different standard about what is funny (except Benny Hill) than we Americans do  but if your into 'crazy' you might enjoy but don't blame me--I WARNED YOU!!

The first advantage is this collection has the disk collected in ten slim line cases, which cuts down on your shelf space considerably compared to previous releases and their full sized DVD cases. Also this release has a pretty extensive PRINTED episode guide booklet that gives more than just a synopsis. You also get a little history of the making of that episode.Now these extras may not be worth the double dipping for those who already bought the previous sets, but for those who never took the plunge now is the time. Not only do you get the great features from the original set, but also stuff you can read and enjoy without having to put a disk in your player.

So number 6 tries to figure out how to get away from the get-go and faces off with #2, who runs the show, the village that is. Of course surveillance is complete in the village and especially his first attempts at escape are thwarted quite easily. The series is very 60ies techy in the fine tradition of the Avengers: the execution and retrieval tool of choice for wayward prisoners is an enormous moving bubble that suddenly shows up out of nowhere. Lava lamps are also quite frequent in this show and go well with the colorful outfits of the village folk - high marks for 60ies cult quality here...So number 6 learns to ropes of the village and hears that if he answers all the required questions, he will be free. He remains defiant (""I am not a number!"")and so in consecutive episodes the #2s are exchanged and each of them try their hand on number 6. This sometimes involves quite elaborate schemes of betrayal and reality theft. As the series goes on, we also find out that the whole idea of the self-contained, isolated village is really thought out to an extreme degree. Of course, after watching 3 or 4 of these we are beginning to realize that no matter what #6 comes up with, he will always wake up in the village again, but that does not take awy from the intrigue of every different episode. We also realize that he will probably never find out who is #1, but that's OK also.The show is well directed and the cinematography is excellent. On a technical note I have to remark that a couple of the episodes have poor video transfer quality, but they are definitely few and far between.

668888,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005NKCQ,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[25, 26]","The Prisoner broke an enormous amount of rules when it premiered in 1968. Patrick McGoohan along with co-creator/story editor and occasional writer George Markstein. Markstein's experience in the Civil Service had an impact on the series; it was he that suggested that such a place as ""The Village"" was rumored to exist for ex-spys (according to rumor McGoohan may also have come up with the idea himself. When the question of what the British do with their retired secret agents came up, a government offical told McGoohan, ""We take care of them""). This peaked McGoohan's interest and McGoohan saw the series as a metaphor for society (and, although frequently missed, it's also a veiled comment on his own celebrity as an actor)and our place in it. Luckily, the metaphor is difficult to pin down so you can argue that The Prisoner is open to interpretation.I met Patrick McGoohan in, of all places, B. Dalton Books in Santa Monica, California. He was shooting Baby for Disney at the time. His star had ebbed but he never lost sight of the themes that interested him as an artist nor did he lose sight of what he was doing for Disney--it was a paying job for an actor pure and simple. As Assistant Manager of the bookstore, I had my sole employee taking lunch. Dalton's policy allowed an employee to put all the phones on hold if there was only 1 person in the store at a time. Luckily, McGoohan's wife was looking for a book and he couldn't get through. He decided that he'd come in himself rather than wait. It's the first and last time I was thankful for the concept of poor customer service.This box set is an improvement on the one originally issued by A&E; last year. The earlier edition had some audio flaws. The picture is pristine and the sound terrific sounding. Watching the series episodes back to back is a fascinating and sometimes frustrating experience. It's amazing that the series was as consistent as could be. Since this wasn't originally designed to be a 17 episode series a couple of the episodes are clearly padding, but they're enjoyable trifles. Some of them such as The General haven't aged as well as others, while some such as the surreal conclusion still pack a lot of intellectual wallop.Fall Out is both perplexing and powerful. McGoohan (who wrote and directed this episode)elected to take the road less traveled; there are no easy answers and when we do finally meet No. 1, we get answers we might not care for. What's interesting is that the episode that precedes the conclusion was originally the 6th episode shot (it was #16 when shown). This suggests that McGoohan may have realized the story potential of this particular episode, held it back and expanded upon its original premise.Others, such as Living in Harmony are even more powerful than when they originally aired (Living in Harmony was seen as a comment on the Vietnam war and, to the best of my recollection, didn't air during the original run). It's also one of the best written and directed episodes--a miniature Western movie in Prisoner garb. McGoohan had always wanted to star in a Western and this episode (not one of the original cycle of episodes)gave him the chance.The extras are nice but not essential. I didn't find The Prisoner Video Companion to be all that involving. It's too basic for fans of the series and basically recycles clips from the stronger episodes of the series. It's a nice addition but not something you'd watch more than once. McGoohan's reluctance to continue to be interviewed about the series is understandable; it's also frustrating for fans of the series. I wouldn't expect him to shed any more light on the themes of the series but it would have been fun to have a alternate audio commentary discussing what he recalled on the making of the pivotal episodes (particularly the three he directed himself).The DVD extra features such as the alternate version of The Chimes of Big Ben, original broadcast trailer for various episodes are nice to have. The alternate opening sequence for the foreign market (France) isn't of particular importance. There is an interview with the series' production designer which provides quite a bit of insight as well. There's also footage of the series location shot in Wales narrated by production designer Bernie Williams. Included with this sequence is rare footage of the original mechanical Rover (shortly to be replaced by the more familar image of the weather balloon).Oh, I didn't give you the end of my meeting McGoohan story. I got his autograph (he was a kind and patient man). I, of course, wasn't tongue tied except when I started telling him how much I enjoyed The Prisoner and Secret Agent (aka Danger Man). Making an [joker] out of myself, I mentioned our shared birthday.  I finished with a nice blunder, ""Mr. MacNee I loved the creativity you showed with The Prisoner"". MacNee, of course, was the star of my other favorite series The Avengers. He didn't bat an eye as he stated ""I'm Patrick McGoohan you're thinking of Patrick MacNee. We Patrick's all look alike"". A very Prisoner moment for a series that deals with identity and freedom as one of its many themes. Based on his delivery of that simple fact, I could easily see him as Ian Fleming's choice for James Bond. In retrospect I have to chuckle but at the time I was mortified when I realized what I had said.Thank God I didn't conclude our brief meeting by saying, ""Be Seeing You""(I'm sure he hears that way too often). A little known fact about McGoohan is that although he is of Irish descent (his parents were Irish immigrants), he was born in Brooklyn. His parents moved back to Ireland when he was a child. That explains a little bit of his clipped accent which sounds vaguely British but with indistinct flecks of an American accent as well.Thanks Patrick for giving the world such a groundbreaking series and for not biting my head off.",5,Be seeing you,1038096000,"11 24, 2002",2002,5887,"['Prisoner', 'broke', 'enormous', 'amount', 'rules', 'when', 'premiered', '1968', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan',

If you know the Prisoner, get the BluRays and cherish them. Occasionally, the stereo audio is not so good on my 2.1 system and the mono version is very low compared to the menu audio. But most of time everything is great.The extras are OK. The couple of few commentary tracks from surviving crew and cast I've listened to were sort of useless. Each disc has episode promotionals for the US release of the show if you care to see how they were promoted. The murky 16 mm, early rough cut of ""The Chimes of Big Ben"" episode is on the supplemental DVD (which wouldn't play on my Samsung BluRay, but works in a computer) and a faded 35mm early edit of the first episode, ""Arrival"" is on the 4th BluRay disc. These are interesting but really not necessary viewing. ""Arrival"" is mostly the same except it has a rejected opening theme (good thing it was) and less of the unique music tracks during the episode as finished. Also Rover has a rejected sound effect that seems to be a combination of Gregorian chants, clicks and somebody breathing in a microphone. Not good at all. The first Rover scene is significantly different, the opening slightly different but the rest of the episode is almost the same. You can also see two versions of the complete ending animated sequence that is very strange and was fortunately edited down for the final show. The documentary on the DVD is probably the best extra. it's filled with interesting interviews and footage.My only complaint is the episode sequence. For years people have been trying to deduce the ""real"" order of the episodes. I would like to put forth that the original, official ITC sequence makes the most sense thematically. You can find this with a quick web search. Worrying about a real world timeline to the Prisoner doesn't make sense to me.

Gassed in his room, he awakens in The Village, a deceptively lovely &amp; inviting prison where everyone is a number &amp; there is no escape. Informed that he is now Number Six, a succession of new Number Twos does their best to break him &amp; discover precisely why he resigned. As the series progresses, the tone becomes more surreal &amp; allegorical ...I first saw this wonderful series as a 14 year old back in 1968, when it appeared as a summer replacement for &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; on CBS. While certainly a product of its time, its questions not only remain timeless but all the more relevant today, when privacy is at an even greater premium &amp; the individual is bombarded with an endless deluge of homogenized consumer, political &amp; cultural inanity &amp; propaganda.What began as a mystery/suspense series quickly became something much deeper, much richer -- but creator &amp; star McGoohan was smart enough to provide plenty of excitement &amp; adventure for those viewers who wanted nothing more than that (although the densely symbolic final episodes must have proven frustrating for them). In various episodes, the series explores the limits of democracy; the role of the media in shaping public opinion; the various aspects of supposedly benign Big Brotherism (both from Left &amp; Right); the perversions of science &amp; technology, often used to mold &amp; control people rather than serve them; the morality of violence in service of the State; the boundary between individual conscience &amp; community need ... and we're just getting started!The dichotomy between the outer holiday atmosphere of the seaside Village &amp; the cold, ruthless interior is powerful. Every episode is a goldmine of pithy, thought-provoking dialogue &amp; startling images, often achieved by very simple means.Complaints about the quality of the special effects completely miss the point. That's like concentrating on the flashy surface of the Village while ignoring what's going on beneath. In fact, the current emphasis on special effects in so many reviews only goes to prove that the triumph of style over substance is even more pervasive today than it was when this show was originally made. Rather than spoon-feed the viewers pre-digested ideas, it demands that they use their imaginations &amp; actually THINK!So visit the Village ... but be warned: once you go there, you'll never truly escape it.

668893,AUTBHG6070SL4,B00005NKCQ,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[16, 16]","The Prisoner was and still is a cult favorite. It had the most incredible mix of content - but first, the story.Our Hero was some kind of super-spy who resigned, for reasons unspecified. He is captured and taken to an isolated compound, The Village. It is peopled by others, like him, whose governments think them too dangerous to be allowed freedom but too valuable to be killed. Our Hero, in one-hour episodes, is unwavering in his resistance to his captors and in his attempts to escape. Interesting premise, maybe, but nothing enduring by itself.The Prisoner's fascination comes from a unique combination of factors. It is founded on a Kafka-like sense of unreality and of hidden authorities with unimagineable power. This was sure to echo inside of people made nervous by the Cold War and the threat of 1984. The show had a veneer of gaiety; the Village looked like a college campus or resort hotel. That veneer covered a core of totalitarian control. For example, the populace is generally dressed informally and comfortably, but in an odd uniform of slacks, sneakers (the same style on everybody), and striped shirts. Many sorts of mind control always lay near the surface, another edgy topic for that propaganda-ridden era. It had elements of science fiction, surrealism, 1960s color and style - too much to capture in words. Above all, personal names were never used, only the prisoners' numbers. This tapped a real fear in the 1960s, that people were being reduced to numbered holes in a computer punchcard.The series was at least 30 years ahead of its time. The ever-present surveillance cameras in the Village compound now appear on highways, intersections, stores, and parking lots. Even homes and dorm rooms have web-cams. Computerization of life has exploded, far beyond what any 1960s viewer could have believed. Even the show's ""Orange Alert"" has a ringing echo the US's current homeland security announcements. The special effects are from the era of Dr. Who and the original Star Trek, but the show's themes still have a startling currency.This collection is an amazing find. It will certainly appeal to people who saw it as first-run TV, but to many other thinking viewers as well.//wiredweird",5,A 1960s look into the future,1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,2213,"['Prisoner', 'was', 'still', 'cult', 'favorite', 'had', 'most', 'incredible', 'mix', 'content', 'first', 'story.Our', 'Hero', 'was', 'kind', 'super-spy', 'who', 'resigned', 'reasons', 'unspecified', 'captured', 'taken', 'isolated', 'compound', 'Village', 'peopled', 'others', 'governments', 'think', 'too', 'dangerous', 'be', 'allowed', 'freedom', 'too', 'valuable', 'be', 'killed', 'Hero', 'one-hour', 'episodes', 'unwavering', 'resistance', 'captors', 'attempts', 'escape', 'Interesting', 'premise', 'maybe', 'nothing', 'enduring', 'itself.The', 'Prisoner', 'fascination', 'unique', 'combination', 'factors', 'founded', 'Kafka-like', 'sense', 'unreality', 'hidden', 'authorities', 'unimagineable', 'power', 'was', 'sure', 'echo', 'people', 'made', 'nervous', 'Cold', 'War', 'threat', '1984', 'show', 'had', 'veneer', 'gaiety', 'Village', 'looked', 'college', 'campus', 'resort', 'hotel', 'veneer', 'covered', 'core', 'totalitarian', 'control', 'example', 'populace', 'generally', 'dressed', 'informally', 'comfortably', 'odd', 'uniform', 'slacks', 'sneakers', 'same', 'style', 'everybody', 'striped', 'shirts', 'Many', 'sorts', 'mind', 'control', 'always', 'lay', 'surface', 'edgy', 'topic', 'propaganda-ridden', 'era', 'had', 'elements', 'science', 'fiction', 'surrealism', '1960s', 'color', 'style', 'too', 'much', 'capture', 'words', 'personal', 'names', 'were', 'never', 'used', 'only', 'prisoners', 'numbers', 'tapped', 'real', 'fear', '1960s', 'people', 'were', 'being', 'reduced', 'numbered', 'holes', 'computer', 'punchcard.The', 'series', 'was', 'least', '30', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'ever-present', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'Village', 'compound', 'now', 'appear', 'highways', 'intersections', 'stores', 'parking', 'lots', 'Even', 'homes', 'dorm', 'rooms', 'have', 'web-cams', 'Computerization', 'life', 'exploded', 'far', 'what', '1960s', 'viewer', 'could', 'have', 'believed', 'Even', 'show', 'Orange', 'Alert', 'ringing', 'echo', 'US', 'current', 'homeland', 'security', 'announcements', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'era', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'show', 'themes', 'still', 'have', 'startling', 'currency.This', 'collection', 'amazing', 'find', 'will', 'certainly', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'first-run', 'TV', 'many', 'other', 'thinking', 'viewers', 'well.//wiredweird']",N/A

""computersandmusicperson""","[1, 1]","When I last watched this I had to view it via crappy VHS tapes or..yeah..I saw it LONG ago in 1969 when it was (at the time) an oddball , visually revolutionary summer replacement TV series.  I recently purchased this on Blu-Ray and finally had a chance to watch a couple episodes on a 42"" 720p LG Plasma TV.  What a difference!  Considering this series was shot in 1969, it looks and sounds flat out great!  It looks to be rendering in 4:3 ratio on my widescreen but that does not bother me much, it was made for TV anyway.  I get the entire 4:3 picture as it was shot, just have the black vertical ""ears"" on the end.  It has that vivid old Eastmancolor look, luxurious color saturation.  No overblown highlights. SHADOW DETAIL IS EXCELLENT! (no murkiness).  I have never experienced this series looking this good.  I say this because various internet reviews for the previous NTSC (American)DVD release complained loudly about visual quality, murkiness, off colors, lack of clarity.  Supposedly the British ""PAL"" scan format DVDs looked presentably good but I didn't want to hassle with special codes or buying a special player - so I held off at that time.  Anyway, visually it's technically superb.Younger people may find it laughable how hopelessly out of date technology is depicted in this series.The various themes brought up by this story are quite engrossing to me:  The idea of Freedom being a cynical non-existent choice that you ""think"" you have.  Or, freedom is the lesser of two thinly veiled evils chosen at that moment for survival.  In this series, any freedom offered is never a real offer - it's just a really bad carrot.  No one is what they seem.  No situation is what it seems.  Everybody wants something - from you and everyone else.  The truth is not enough for those who will never believe it. One has to fight for and make one's own freedom but...it's implied that, in the end,  we are our own worst enemy.  : )Don't worry, it's not a total downer, it's leavened with humor in surprising ways.
