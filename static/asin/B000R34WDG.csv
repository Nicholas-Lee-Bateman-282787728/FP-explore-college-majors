Living in Arizona I thought it'd be fun to have a copy. When I watched it I must say I was some what disappointed. The editing is really quite poor. At times they flip back and forth between shots in a manner best suited to some MTV video, not a scenic portrayal. Then there are the ""shot out of the car window"" pieces that don't really seem up to the task. My final gripe was that no matter what I did to the color settings I could not get a realistic rendition of what I've seen in person a number of times.. In conclusion, it's probably worth 11$ if you've never been to all the places they show, but only 11$ - you get what you pay for.",2,you get what you pay for,1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,763,"['Having', 'watched', 'BBC', 'planet', 'earth', 'HD-DVD', 'went', 'search', 'somethingelse', 'genre', 'came', 'disc', 'Living', 'Arizona', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'fun', 'have', 'copy', 'When', 'watched', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'what', 'disappointed', 'editing', 'really', 'quite', 'poor', 'times', 'flip', 'back', 'forth', 'shots', 'manner', 'best', 'suited', 'MTV', 'video', 'not', 'scenic', 'portrayal', 'Then', 'are', 'shot', 'car', 'window', 'pieces', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'up', 'task', 'final', 'gripe', 'was', 'matter', 'what', 'did', 'color', 'settings', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'realistic', 'rendition', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'person', 'number', 'times..', 'conclusion', 'probably', 'worth', '11', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'places', 'show', 'only', '11', 'get', 'what', 'pay']",Dreaming Arizona

The scenery in HD is absolutely stunning and I love the Native American music.  The map feature is a nice extra.  An option for narration with music in the background (something like Planet Earth) would have put this disc beyond five stars, though it is still enjoyable as it is.",4,Almost Perfect,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,424,"['title', 'really', 'five', 'stars', 'opinion', 'gave', 'four', 'narration', 'option', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'perfect', 'scenery', 'HD', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'love', 'Native', 'American', 'music', 'map', 'feature', 'nice', 'extra', 'option', 'narration', 'music', 'background', 'something', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'disc', 'five', 'stars', 'still', 'enjoyable']",Dreaming Arizona
