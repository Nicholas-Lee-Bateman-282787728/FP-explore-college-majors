906011,A2FMPWCAQSQJ2E,B0009I8ALY,Amazon Customer,"[2, 4]","This was my first Debbie Siebers workout and I'm dissappointed. The intensity and effectiveness is there, but it is boring, non-motivation, with bad music and sound quality. There is also no chaptering or any premixes, or mix and match options like other DVDs offer.The workout style is a little like Jari Love, just less interesting and Debbie's personality is like Shelly McDonald's of Caribbean Workout. I like both Jari and Shelly and I can't say I dislike Debbie, it's just such a boring workout, I don't want to do again.",3,Effective but Boring,1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,527,"['was', 'first', 'Debbie', 'Siebers', ""'m"", 'dissappointed', 'intensity', 'effectiveness', 'there', 'boring', 'non-motivation', 'bad', 'music', 'sound', 'quality', 'also', 'chaptering', 'premixes', 'mix', 'match', 'options', 'other', 'DVDs', 'offer.The', 'workout', 'style', 'little', 'Jari', 'Love', 'just', 'less', 'interesting', 'Debbie', 'personality', 'Shelly', 'McDonald', 'Caribbean', 'Workout', 'Jari', 'Shelly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'dislike', 'Debbie', 'just', 'such', 'boring', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'again']",Shape It Up - Debbie Siebers' Slim Series DVD
906012,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0009I8ALY,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[43, 43]","This is a very good full-body strength workout which uses the ""high repetition, low weight"" style; for the majority of the workout, instructor Debbie Siebers uses only 5 lbs. weights, and she advises you to drop down to 3 lbs. if necessary.  The format of the routine is to work opposing muscle groups with weights while adding core work inbetween each weight segment.The workout starts with a basic (somewhat boring) 5-minute warmup and then moves into the following segments (times are approximate):  lower body, 6 mins. (squats, dips, kicks); standing core 1, 2.5 mins. (side reaches, side bends); chest/shoulders, 3.5 mins.; standing core 2, 2 mins. (twists, punches); biceps/triceps, 4 mins.; standing core 3, 2 mins. (knee lifts, more twists and punches);  lower body, 10 mins. (standing and seated moves with optional ankle weights); floor chest/tricep work, 7 mins.; floor lower body, 10 mins. (crunches, thigh work); and standing shoulders/biceps/triceps with heavier weights (8 lbs.), 7 mins.  The workout then ends with a brief (4 mins.) stretch for a total time of 78 minutes.This was my first-ever Slim Series workout, and I was a little daunted by the long length.  However, several factors made the workout feel manageable rather than overwhelming:  1) having the non-weighted core toning work interspersed with the weight work provided a bit of rest time and ensured that I never felt totally overworked, 2) moving to the floor about halfway through the program provided a bit of a ""break"" (even though the floor work was definitely tough!), and 3) the countdown timer which shows you how much time is left; at times, this could be a bit discouraging, but the timer was accompanied by a series of little dots which slowly disappeared as you completed each segment--this was definitely motivating!Many people complain about the music in these workouts; I found it to be okay, if somewhat loud and a bit repetitive.  I had more of a problem with the sound quality, which seemed a bit echo-y.  Another thing I found a bit disappointing was that although there was plenty of standing core work (which I really liked), the floor abs work was not very intense.  After doing the workout yesterday, however, today I am pleasantly sore in my side waist area as well as just a bit in the abs themselves.  In fact, I like that this workout left me with a manageable soreness rather than the pain that I was anticipating.  Overall, I enjoyed this workout more than I thought I would, and despite the length, I am looking forward to doing it again soon.",4,Very good full-body workout targeting opposing muscle groups,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,2556,"['very', 'good', 'full-body', 'strength', 'workout', 'high', 'repetition', 'low', 'weight', 'style', 'majority', 'workout', 'instructor', 'Debbie', 'Siebers', 'only', '5', 'lbs', 'weights', 'drop', 'down', '3', 'lbs', 'necessary', 'format', 'routine', 'work', 'opposing', 'muscle', 'groups', 'weights', 'adding', 'core', 'work', 'inbetween', 'weight', 'segment.The', 'workout', 'basic', 'somewhat', 'boring', '5-minute', 'warmup', 'then', 'following', 'segments', 'times', 'are', 'approximate', 'lower', 'body', '6', 'mins', 'squats', 'dips', 'kicks', 'standing', 'core', '1', '2.5', 'mins', 'side', 'reaches', 'side', 'bends', 'chest/shoulders', '3.5', 'mins', 'standing', 'core', '2', '2', 'mins', 'twists', 'punches', 'biceps/triceps', '4', 'mins', 'standing', 'core', '3', '2', 'mins', 'knee', 'lifts', 'more', 'twists', 'punches', 'lower', 'body', '10', 'mins', 'standing', 'seated', 'moves', 'optional', 'ankle', 'weights', 'floor', 'chest/tricep', 'work', '7', 'mins', 'floor', 'lower', 'body', '10', 'mins', 'crunches', 'thigh', 'work', 'standing', 'shoulders/biceps/triceps', 'heavier', 'weights', '8', 'lbs', '7', 'mins', 'workout', 'then', 'brief', '4', 'mins', 'stretch', 'total', 'time', '78', 'minutes.This', 'was', 'first-ever', 'Slim', 'Series', 'workout', 'was', 'little', 'daunted', 'long', 'length', 'However', 'several', 'factors', 'made', 'workout', 'feel', 'manageable', 'rather', 'overwhelming', '1', 'having', 'non-weighted', 'core', 'toning', 'work', 'interspersed', 'weight', 'work', 'provided', 'bit', 'rest', 'time', 'ensured', 'never', 'felt', 'totally', 'overworked', '2', 'moving', 'floor', 'halfway', 'program', 'provided', 'bit', 'break', 'even', 'floor', 'work', 'was', 'definitely', 'tough', '3', 'countdown', 'timer', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'left', 'times', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'discouraging', 'timer', 'was', 'accompanied', 'series', 'little', 'dots', 'slowly', 'disappeared', 'completed', 'segment', 'was', 'definitely', 'motivating', 'Many', 'people', 'complain', 'music', 'workouts', 'found', 'be', 'okay', 'somewhat', 'loud', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'had', 'more', 'problem', 'sound', 'quality', 'seemed', 'bit', 'echo-y', 'thing', 'found', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'was', 'was', 'plenty', 'standing', 'core', 'work', 'really', 'liked', 'floor', 'abs', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'intense', 'doing', 'workout', 'yesterday', 'however', 'today', 'am', 'pleasantly', 'sore', 'side', 'waist', 'area', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'bit', 'abs', 'fact', 'like', 'workout', 'left', 'manageable', 'soreness', 'rather', 'pain', 'was', 'anticipating', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'workout', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'length', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'doing', 'again', 'soon']",Shape It Up - Debbie Siebers' Slim Series DVD

906015,A2UWAMILXW2PR3,B0009I8ALY,"patricio ""book lover""","[2, 3]","I received this DVD just a few days ago after purchasing it for a penny plus $2.50 shipping thinking that I could not lose as if I didnt like it no big loss as I paid so little for it. I had watched the infomercials on T.V but didnt want to pay that much and maybe end up not liking it so when I found an older version of it I decided to try it and I have to say I am very impressed by Debbie Siebers and her professionalism and preciseness that is lacking in some other exercise DVDs that I use. I surprised myself by being able to get thru the whole thing using 5-8lb weights! I have exercised regularly for about 30 years starting from my mid teens so have always been in good shape and have kept off the middle aged spread because of it. Very rarely anymore do I feel my muscles like I have with this workout and think maybe it is the extended time with lots of repetitions and the precision of the moves. Also she starts the workout on time and does not spend the first few minutes of the workout standing talking and instead talks and guides us and then precisely on time starts the work out so that you do workout for exactly 78 minutes. I started Monday and it is now Wednesday and I have just finished my second session and can tell you that I feel worked out and still feel sore from the Monday session especially in the triceps and upper thighs and chest area which usually I do not feel with my other workout programs. I have read reviews that complain about the music but I have no problem at all with it as we are not in a dance club but in a serious exercise session that does not need distracting music but something that makes time go by quicker and easier and has a good beat. I plan to work out to this DVD Monday, Wednesday and Friday for the next six weeks and then I will give another review as to my progress. I find Debbie to be beautiful to look at and very toned and slim without looking mannish and in fact I find her to be quite elegant and her presentation and manner is very pleasing and professional without going over the top. She suits me just fine but as people are different others may prefer oter personality types. I like to get down to business and thats what she does without being too dry or too silly.  Highly recommend this and I am very surprised at how much I am enjoying it!",5,Perfect!,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2319,"['received', 'DVD', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'purchasing', 'penny', '2.50', 'shipping', 'thinking', 'could', 'not', 'lose', 'didnt', 'big', 'loss', 'paid', 'so', 'little', 'had', 'watched', 'infomercials', 'T.V', 'didnt', 'want', 'pay', 'much', 'maybe', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'liking', 'when', 'found', 'older', 'version', 'decided', 'try', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'Debbie', 'Siebers', 'professionalism', 'preciseness', 'lacking', 'other', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'use', 'surprised', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'whole', 'thing', 'using', '5-8lb', 'weights', 'have', 'exercised', 'regularly', 'about', '30', 'years', 'starting', 'mid', 'teens', 'so', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'shape', 'have', 'kept', 'off', 'middle', 'aged', 'spread', 'Very', 'rarely', 'anymore', 'do', 'feel', 'muscles', 'have', 'workout', 'think', 'maybe', 'extended', 'time', 'lots', 'repetitions', 'precision', 'moves', 'Also', 'workout', 'time', 'not', 'spend', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'workout', 'standing', 'talking', 'instead', 'talks', 'guides', 'then', 'precisely', 'time', 'work', 'out', 'so', 'do', 'exactly', '78', 'minutes', 'started', 'Monday', 'now', 'Wednesday', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'second', 'session', 'can', 'tell', 'feel', 'worked', 'out', 'still', 'feel', 'sore', 'Monday', 'session', 'especially', 'triceps', 'upper', 'thighs', 'chest', 'area', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'other', 'workout', 'programs', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'complain', 'music', 'have', 'problem', 'are', 'not', 'dance', 'club', 'serious', 'exercise', 'session', 'not', 'need', 'distracting', 'music', 'something', 'time', 'go', 'quicker', 'easier', 'good', 'beat', 'plan', 'work', 'out', 'DVD', 'Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday', 'next', 'six', 'weeks', 'then', 'will', 'give', 'review', 'progress', 'find', 'Debbie', 'be', 'beautiful', 'look', 'very', 'toned', 'slim', 'looking', 'mannish', 'fact', 'find', 'be', 'quite', 'elegant', 'presentation', 'manner', 'very', 'pleasing', 'professional', 'going', 'top', 'suits', 'just', 'fine', 'people', 'are', 'different', 'others', 'may', 'prefer', 'oter', 'personality', 'types', 'like', 'get', 'down', 'business', 'thats', 'what', 'being', 'too', 'dry', 'too', 'silly', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'am', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'am', 'enjoying']",Shape It Up - Debbie Siebers' Slim Series DVD

I have a hard time finding a challenge in most workouts.  However, this workout was surprisingly challenging.  The length of it, the repetition,  and the fact that you can vary your weights help.  Two days after completing this DVD, my thighs were so sore I was shocked!  I rarely experience soreness anymore, and certainly not to this extent!
