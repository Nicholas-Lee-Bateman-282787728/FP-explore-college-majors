It quickly shows you how little we know about the skys above us and where we came from. Are there other life forms out there, probably, but you quickly find out how lucky we are to have a planet with all the right conditions to support mankind.

Star Trek Next Generation was one of the first TV shows to come out with surround sound ... and boy did that add 14 dimensions to my audio space.  It probably threw in a couple more parallel universes in there at the same time.  I can't understand how a great series like this is so technologically backwards ... it's just a crying shame.  The only reason I can think of is they do not care what people think of their product.  Outer space has such great envelopment with 5.1 audio.

Did the Ever, For instance stop & think, that Maybe, Just maybe, The Mayan Astrologer, Who wrote the calendar, Just couldn't go on to complete it? That maybe he was working on it, & Just passed on the next day, Leaving his fragile work Unfinished?
