1125024,AXJTNYD3UK1BP,B0010AN7MM,"1smileycat ""1smileycat""","[3, 3]","In reading the backside of the DVD, I was excited to watch The Lather Effect!  Unfortunately, I was bored to tears throughout it.This is about the day after a high school reunion party.  They are all in their 30's now and they show up to the reunion as they used to look.  Seems some of them came as they used to be as well - immature!They wake up at a house that is torn apart, they are all nursing hangovers - or still drunk, and they reminisce about the way things were, what happened all those years ago, etc.  They decide they need another night of the fun; which added up to pure boredom for me.Being a 30-something myself, I really thought I would love this movie.  But the music was the only thing I found myself enjoying.The cast includes Tate Donovan, Ione Skye, Eric Stoltz, David Herman, William Mapother, Connie Britton, Peter Facinelli, Sarah Clarke, Caitlin Keats, Eric Haase, Dominic Kelly, and Sarah Kelly.  The DVD also includes a commentary, a few featurettes, and deleted scenes.I cannot recommend this movie.

1125025,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B0010AN7MM,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[2, 2]","Another tried and tested formula with a ""now grown up"" group revisiting their past at a reunion, but this is much better (and funnier) than ""Old School"" or other recent offerings.A great soundtrack of 80's classics is also well placed throughout the movie, but it's the characters, acting and emotion that really brings the movie to life.The ensemble cast may not be considered current box office stars, but there are a lot of familiar faces in this picture, not least Eric Stolz, and former child star David Herman who are hilarious, and steal each scene respectively. It's a funny picture, but it's underpinned with a message of missed opportunity, youth, revisiting old times, and even pathos at times, as each character attempts to untie the knots in there respective life paths since last they met. Old relationships are revisited, old flames fanned, and many skeletons get an airing from the closet. I felt that it was all handled with a light touch by director Sarah Kelly who manages to keep the picture moving and injects levity strategically throughout.I suspect that the people who will get the most from this movie are those that can remember the 80's and be of the same age as the characters. Some of the humor and situations may be lost on a younger viewers, and it isn't raucous or full of innuendo and cheap titillation, which in turn will probably mean it will not command a wide audience.4 stars overall.

1125026,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,B0010AN7MM,Andrew McCaffrey,"[2, 3]","A word of advice to the marketers of film.  The tag-line for this movie -- used in much of the publicity and repeated on the back of the DVD case -- is: ""If the '80s were the ultimate party, welcome to the hangover.""  This cannot possibly have been thought to appeal to anyone who has ever had a hangover, anyone who has ever known anyone who has had a hangover, or anyone who owns a dictionary and can research what a hangover must be like to experience.  Hangovers are unpleasant; you probably don't want the audience associating your film with something unpleasant before the first reel has begun.The movie's opening scene is the aforementioned hangover.  Specifically, it's the morning after a massive reunion party where a bunch of 30-somethings trashed one of their parent's house (kindly, they threw the party just two days before the house is to be inspected for sale).  Given the effort the producers went through to decorate the set to convey the absolute madness that this party must have entailed, I was initially expecting a lot of flashbacks to the party but there were none to be seen.Gene Siskel once opined that the creators had failed if their final film was less interesting than a hypothetical documentary about the same cast and crew having lunch together.  I'd like to add a corollary to that statement.  Is this film more interesting than behind-the-scenes footage of the set designers emptying and placing beer cans and vodka bottles in every possible location?  I couldn't help but feel that showing us the party would have been much more fun than simply telling us about it.The film revolves around a group of friends looking back on their high school days, thinking about how things were, how things are now and how things could have been.  Despite the good cast, many times I simply felt that I was flipping through someone else's yearbook.  I could relate to the immediate personalities of the characters, but the actual history and backstory didn't quite come through.I think my opinion of this film can be summarized by the reaction I had when one of the 36-year-old characters says in a sad tone, ""I can't believe high school is over.""What?!  You...  What?!(Granted, I am slightly paraphrasing in that quote, but that is definitely the meaning behind the line.)The characters are so self-absorbed, so backward-looking that I found most of their monologues to be extremely irritating.  And after I was annoyed, I found it mildly depressing to think of people hanging on to the pettiness and silliness of events from twenty years prior.  This isn't a treatise on Faulkner's ""The dead is never past""; this is simply a group of people who need a kick in the backside and an order to grow up.And I have to say that this is a  difficult film to dislike.  It's very enthusiastic.  Earnest perhaps is an adequate way of describing it.  It's got a good pace and was well produced.  The chemistry between the cast members is exceptionally good; I immediately believed that they had been friends for decades with their own interweaving, complicated pasts.  Eric Stoltz is particularly fun as the metaphorical Voice of God who dispenses wisdom and truth throughout the film.I think the main problem with the film is that it falls between two stools.  It's not an immature, raunchy, no-holds-barred fun fest.  And neither is it a mature and deep look at the way people grow and change over the years.  For an example of the latter, take the story of a character who begins the film unhappy and regretful about her life.  By the end of the film, mentally and emotionally reconciling just one event in her past completely changes her entire outlook on life.  It's too neat.This criticism of that particular plot point is reflective of other parts of the film.  The conclusion is reached far too easily.  Everything ends up tidy which just doesn't ring true given the messiness we spend the whole movie exploring.  Several threads are just forgotten about or their resolution is far too simplistic.THE LATHER EFFECT is competently made and well-acted.  It tells its story effectively.  I just happened to really dislike what the film was saying.  It's not terribly funny when it's shallow and it isn't particularly meaningful when it's deep.  It tries to do too many things at once and ends up not succeeding at most of them.",2,Don't repeat,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,4341,"['word', 'advice', 'marketers', 'film', 'tag-line', 'movie', 'used', 'much', 'publicity', 'repeated', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', ""'80s"", 'were', 'ultimate', 'party', 'welcome', 'hangover', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'have', 'been', 'thought', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'hangover', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'known', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'hangover', 'anyone', 'who', 'dictionary', 'can', 'research', 'what', 'hangover', 'must', 'be', 'experience', 'Hangovers', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'audience', 'associating', 'film', 'something', 'unpleasant', 'first', 'reel', 'begun.The', 'movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'aforementioned', 'hangover', 'Specifically', 'morning', 'massive', 'reunion', 'party', 'where', 'bunch', '30-somethings', 'trashed', 'one', 'parent', 'house', 'kindly', 'threw', 'party', 'just', 'two', 'days', 'house', 'be', 'inspected', 'sale', 'Given', 'effort', 'producers', 'went', 'decorate', 'set', 'convey', 'absolute', 'madness', 'party', 'must', 'have', 'entailed', 'was', 'initially', 'expecting', 'lot', 'flashbacks', 'party', 'were', 'none', 'be', 'seen.Gene', 'Siskel', 'once', 'opined', 'creators', 'had', 'failed', 'final', 'film', 'was', 'less', 'interesting', 'hypothetical', 'documentary', 'same', 'cast', 'crew', 'having', 'lunch', 'together', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'corollary', 'statement', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'set', 'designers', 'emptying', 'placing', 'beer', 'cans', 'vodka', 'bottles', 'possible', 'location', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'showing', 'party', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'simply', 'telling', 'it.The', 'film', 'group', 'friends', 'looking', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'thinking', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'now', 'how', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'cast', 'many', 'times', 'simply', 'felt', 'was', 'flipping', 'someone', 'else', 'yearbook', 'could', 'relate', 'immediate', 'personalities', 'characters', 'actual', 'history', 'backstory', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'through.I', 'think', 'opinion', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'summarized', 'reaction', 'had', 'when', 'one', '36-year-old', 'characters', 'sad', 'tone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'high', 'school', 'over.', 'What', 'What', 'Granted', 'am', 'slightly', 'paraphrasing', 'quote', 'definitely', 'meaning', 'line', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'self-absorbed', 'so', 'backward-looking', 'found', 'most', 'monologues', 'be', 'extremely', 'irritating', 'was', 'annoyed', 'found', 'mildly', 'depressing', 'think', 'people', 'hanging', 'pettiness', 'silliness', 'events', 'twenty', 'years', 'prior', ""n't"", 'treatise', 'Faulkner', 'dead', 'never', 'past', 'simply', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'kick', 'backside', 'order', 'grow', 'up.And', 'have', 'say', 'difficult', 'film', 'dislike', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'Earnest', 'perhaps', 'adequate', 'way', 'describing', 'got', 'good', 'pace', 'was', 'well', 'produced', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'members', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'immediately', 'believed', 'had', 'been', 'friends', 'decades', 'own', 'interweaving', 'complicated', 'pasts', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'particularly', 'fun', 'metaphorical', 'Voice', 'God', 'who', 'wisdom', 'truth', 'film.I', 'think', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'two', 'stools', 'not', 'immature', 'raunchy', 'no-holds-barred', 'fun', 'fest', 'mature', 'deep', 'look', 'way', 'people', 'grow', 'change', 'years', 'example', 'latter', 'take', 'story', 'character', 'who', 'film', 'unhappy', 'regretful', 'life', 'end', 'film', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'reconciling', 'just', 'one', 'event', 'past', 'completely', 'changes', 'entire', 'outlook', 'life', 'too', 'neat.This', 'criticism', 'particular', 'plot', 'point', 'reflective', 'other', 'parts', 'film', 'conclusion', 'reached', 'far', 'too', 'easily', 'Everything', 'up', 'tidy', 'just', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'given', 'messiness', 'spend', 'whole', 'movie', 'exploring', 'Several', 'threads', 'are', 'just', 'forgotten', 'about', 'resolution', 'far', 'too', 'simplistic.THE', 'LATHER', 'EFFECT', 'competently', 'made', 'well-acted', 'story', 'effectively', 'just', 'happened', 'really', 'dislike', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'saying', 'not', 'terribly', 'funny', 'when', 'shallow', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'meaningful', 'when', 'deep', 'do', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'once', 'up', 'not', 'succeeding', 'most']",N/A
1125027,A3GKMK6KQH3Y1H,B0010AN7MM,B. Niedt,"[0, 1]","The Lather Effect, you may have figured out by now, is like ""The Big Chill"" for Gen-Xers.  The problem is, it's not nearly as good, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a ""baby-boomer"".  The cast is decent - strong if not A-list.  You may recognize Tate Donovan from a number of indie films; or Ione Skye, for whom I've had a crush since ""Say Anything""; Sarah Clarke, the evil Nina Myers of TV's ""24""; Connie Britton (Spin City, Friday Night Lights); and of course Eric Stoltz.  So there's enough talent here - if only they were given a decent script.  The premise is similar to The Big Chill: a bunch of old school friends in their late 30's get together for a weekend at the home of two of them (twenty years on, in this case). Of course all the usual issues come up: success and failure (one character is a former child star), arrested development (Britton's character is especially conflicted concerning an old flame, selling her childhood home, and generally acting grown-up and responsible), rekindled romances, general regret and nostalgia.  There's no huge epiphany or revelation in the story, either, except a confession that's connected to the breakup of the relationship of two of the members. What made The Big Chill work was the wonderfully snappy dialog that made you laugh out loud at times, and a plot that made you care about the characters.  You get neither of that here - I don't think I even chuckled once during this film.  I also found the characters self-centered and annoying, especially Stoltz's character, who speaks in some weird affected accent (""Valley Boy?"") and rattles off non-significant bon mots, especially his theory that's the basis for the title - and even that doesn't amount to much.  Yeah, the soundtrack is pretty cool, especially if you cut your teeth on early MTV, but a soundtrack CD will fulfill that need.  In summary, don't waste your money buying it, think twice before renting, and if you're really insistent on seeing it, wait till it's on the free movie channel.",2,"Sharp Cast, Dull Story",1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,2018,"['Lather', 'Effect', 'may', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'now', 'Big', 'Chill', 'Gen-Xers', 'problem', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'saying', ""'m"", 'baby-boomer', 'cast', 'decent', 'strong', 'not', 'A-list', 'may', 'recognize', 'Tate', 'Donovan', 'number', 'indie', 'films', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'had', 'crush', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'evil', 'Nina', 'Myers', 'TV', '24', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'Spin', 'City', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'course', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'enough', 'talent', 'here', 'only', 'were', 'given', 'decent', 'script', 'premise', 'similar', 'Big', 'Chill', 'bunch', 'old', 'school', 'friends', 'late', '30', 'get', 'together', 'weekend', 'home', 'two', 'twenty', 'years', 'case', 'course', 'usual', 'issues', 'come', 'up', 'success', 'failure', 'one', 'character', 'former', 'child', 'star', 'arrested', 'development', 'Britton', 'character', 'especially', 'conflicted', 'concerning', 'old', 'flame', 'selling', 'childhood', 'home', 'generally', 'acting', 'grown-up', 'responsible', 'rekindled', 'romances', 'general', 'regret', 'nostalgia', 'huge', 'epiphany', 'revelation', 'story', 'either', 'confession', 'connected', 'breakup', 'relationship', 'two', 'members', 'What', 'made', 'Big', 'Chill', 'work', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'snappy', 'dialog', 'made', 'loud', 'times', 'plot', 'made', 'care', 'characters', 'get', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'chuckled', 'once', 'film', 'also', 'found', 'characters', 'self-centered', 'annoying', 'especially', 'Stoltz', 'character', 'who', 'weird', 'affected', 'accent', 'Valley', 'Boy', 'non-significant', 'bon', 'mots', 'especially', 'theory', 'basis', 'title', 'even', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'Yeah', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'cool', 'especially', 'cut', 'teeth', 'early', 'MTV', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'will', 'fulfill', 'need', 'summary', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'buying', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'renting', ""'re"", 'really', 'insistent', 'seeing', 'free', 'movie', 'channel']",N/A

""a Big Chill for a new generation"", or ""suspense worthy of Hitchcock"" or anything relating itself to something that was already done previously and most likely done better.I wasn't a big fan of ""The Big Chill"", but I know there was one thing about it that ""THE LATHER EFFECT"" failed to do; make you care about the characters. The movies first mistake was its premise to begin with. Why on earth producers and studios keep funding movies that obviously have nothing 'new' to bring to the table or its only redeeming factor is that it's LIKE something that has already been done? I don't get it.It was cheaply done. Poor camera shots with no intent to correct lighting. Amateur mistakes like shooting somebody who is standing in front of a large sunlit window or just settling with a dark outside gathering and or a dark bedroom rather than lighting them better.All that aside, THE LATHER EFFECT, is just plain forgettable and time consuming. It's almost like going to a high school reunion and then realizing that you didn't go to that school and don't know any of these people. They're talking about things that you never took part in and people that you never knew and they never even attempt to rectify that.That being said, you're better off spending time with your REAL FRIENDS than watching this movie.

Schneider,"[2, 3]","Now you'll have to take this review with a grain of salt....I graduated high school during this time period so for me it was a fun movie. I enjoyed the whole premise of having a ""come as you were"" party, where they all dressed up in 80's garb.  If you are younger than your mid thirties/early 40's you probably will think they over exaggerated the weird costumes, but alas, the million black rubber bracelets, chunky crosses, leggings with skirts, lace gloves and big hair....sadly true.The soundtrack is fun.  Lots of the hits that you listened to during the time. I kind of felt like I was with my own group of friends waxing a little nostalgic for the simpler times before life in general got harder.The premise?  Well, it is a ""come as you were 80's party"" that is being held at the childhood home of one of the old 80's gang.  She is at the home of her parents as they are away as someone needs to be there as they are selling the house and the walk-through is happening in a couple days.  Good time for a party right?

1125041,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0010AN7MM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","It's the day after an all-out Pali High reunion bash held at the home of one of the revelers, and so bring on the wicked, wicked hangovers. THE LATHER EFFECT opens up with longtime friends regrouping the morning after to chow down on deli cold cuts and to further reminisce. Lots of things to clean up and air out, as the party has left an indelible mark, not only on the ruined house itself but also on the participants. THE LATHER EFFECT is a dramedy of old friendships and lingering heartbreaks and nagging regrets, and there's lots and lots of talking. And, since this premise isn't exactly new, you probably already know where it's all heading.The story centers on nine familiar characters, all thirty-somethings, all with issues crying out to be resolved, all clinging to the past (excepting Tate Donovan's practical, quasi-stuffy character). These cats are fine and dandy on the surface, but mostly messed up underneath. The actors, a cast of B-listers and unknowns, do a fine job fleshing out their characters, and it's not their fault that the story is unoriginal and the script mostly waterlogged with uninspired dialogue and telegraphed twists. THE LATHER EFFECT didn't keep me on the edge of the sofa, didn't make me go ""Oh, snap!"" - although I was mildly curious as to how things would turn out for several of the supporting characters, particularly the stunning, brainy, and promiscuous Katrina (Caitlin Keats) and the restless housewife Claire (Sarah Clarke, of 24). Eric Stoltz, who affects a surfer dude accent, walks away with the most interesting role honors, closely followed by Caitlin Keats (who is so sexy I'm very surprised she hasn't done more films). The central characters, I didn't care for as much. This suggests something uncomplimentary about the film.THE LATHER EFFECT falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. I certainly didn't mind watching it, but it wasn't like I had my eyeballs glued to the screen, absentmindedly wolfing down popcorn. I wouldn't call it an insightful film, but it does strive to be an honest one. There are several good moments here (though not enough), some well done scenes involving these friends simply hanging out or in full shindig mode. There are fine scenes of barefaced confessions and throwaway truths. One sweet example happens during a party game, as the younger-than-the-others Danny disarmingly narrates how he lost his virginity in high school to a college girl, and, yes, it involves one of these women present. Another one is the Eric Stoltz character's perceptive breakdown of how to win the beauteous Katrina, always available but ever unattainable (trust me, it makes sense in the film). But my favorite bit has to be the gang rocking out in the living room to Dr. Sauce's ""Swamprat.""

Well done homage to ""The Big Chill,"" (you will notice many similarities) with a group of Gen Xers getting together for a high school reunion in their 30's. (Must be a 15 year reunion, because 20 years would put them closer to their 40s, unless they all graduated young. It has more the feel of a 20 year than a 10 year reunion about it, however.) We don't see the actual reunion, as the action begins the ""morning after,"" complete with hangovers and ""oh my god, did she really do that?!"" situations. It captures very well the kind of nostalgia and behavior reunions like this can involve (for any generation, I might add). It also captures human behavior in all its silliness, pain, warmth, and joy.The music is vintage 80s and very good. It's also cool to see real vinyl records again. Great ensemble cast makes the characters and their interactions believable. The dialog is honest, sexy, funny, and about as realistic as a movie can be. There is no nudity or sexual activity (unless you count kissing), but plenty of frank sexual talk about sexual activity and swearing. There is also drinking and drug use, so be advised.It stands up well on multiple viewings, and the ""making of"" extras add a lot to the feel of the film.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 7]","Tate Donovan, Eric Stoltz, Ione Skye and Connie Britton head up a decent cast in ""The Lather Effect,"" a mild comedy where friends gather for a ""Come As You Were"" 80's party and wake up to find themselves older and still dealing with the past.  While cleaning up Britton's home, the group remembers the old days, mistakes made, what if's, good things, old flames, etc.  Some of them can't see beyond their pasts while others have firmly gripped their current lives and prepare for the future.  As the group divides into various sized smaller groups, the film cuts between all of them as they talk.....a lot.  What you have in the end is a somewhat depressing remembrance of days long gone mixed in with a few comedic moments.Stoltz, although he plays the older ""party crasher"" guy, holds this tale together as the voice of wisdom.  He seems to be channeling a little bit of his stoner character from ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High.""  Tate Donovan does a good job as the ""serious"" one.  The rest of the group fills in the normal stereotypes:  the easy girl, the person holding onto the past, the little brother, the good girl with marital problems, etc., etc.  To top it all off, you have a former child star thrown into the fray.The cover of the DVD boasts an ""awesome soundtrack"" that really is pretty awesome.  However, when a film brags on the strength of its soundtrack on the front of the DVD case, that should be a warning that this film may not necessarily be the greatest thing around.Deleted scenes, forgettable documentaries and audio commentary make for your average special features.In short, you'll love the music that plays throughout this film.

At first the characters seem like a depressingly immature bunch, but they become more likeable and interesting as the story proceeds.Corey (David Herman) is probably the most interesting character, and ultimately proves to have been the catalyst for several of the other characters' main regrets in life.  Certainly the movie's finest moment comes when Jack (William Mapother) expresses his forgiveness of Corey by asking him to play air drums during the rendition of ""Swamp Rat"".On the other hand, what we learn near the end of the movie about Mickey (Eric Stoltz) makes him perhaps the film's most admirable character.  Stoltz, who also served as the movie's associate producer, is one of those actors who have never become huge stars despite appearing in so many movies that almost everyone has seen at least one of them.  He's clearly having a lot of fun with his role here, and even gets to deliver the dialogue explaining the film's title.But ""The Lather Effect"" is not without flaws.  The final revelation about Valinda (Connie Britton) comes as no surprise and is probably the most cliched possible ending for her storyline.  The excursion to the police station is harmful to the film's unity of place; the climactic scene between Valinda and Jack at the baseball field less so.

1125056,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B0010AN7MM,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[6, 8]","This movie touts itself as ""a `Big Chill' for Generation X"".  Sorry, but that film has substance, poignancy and a great stellar cast.  All this ""film"" has is one recognizable name, Eric Stoltz and he's forty- seven - not exactly in his thirties.  But that's being petty, like this film, so I'd have to simply describe it as one big hangover than never gets cured.  The entire premise is one last party amongst friends at a house that just happens to be on the market to be sold the next day.The first scene is the heroine waking up in her bed, hung-over and as she rolls over, she finds a used condom.  Welcome to the plot.  The rest of the film consists of various party members pulling themselves together and talking about the night before.  The house is so overly party damaged that it looks like a big cartoon.  Bras, clothing, beer kegs, adult toys, booze bottles, empty pizza boxes and anything else that the crew could toss in is everywhere.  It looks more like the entire college campus had the party in that one house.  It is overdone.For the less than a dozen or so actors, the dialogue is common, pedestrian, boring, juvenile and malignant.  There is simply no connection between characters nor is there a single moment that is humorous.  The language is foul.  Not that that is a problem, other than it is simply foul to be foul.  No relevance.  I found this film to be actually painful to watch.  Some of the conversations try to speak of meaningful moments from the past, but they are petty and adolescent.  None of the conversations go in any meaningful direction.  There is simply a beginning, a middle part and an end and none of it satisfies.  A minor soundtrack is attached for a little ambience, but it's too little too late and it never even made it to a compact disc.  They called this, ""The Lather Effect"" and that seems appropriate, as when I was done watching this debacle of a money-waster, I felt like I needed a long shower.To use a quote:  ""I can eat a can of Kodak and puke a better movie."" -- Kim Novak in The Mirror Crack'd",1,One Big Hangover,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,2056,"['movie', 'Big', 'Chill', 'Generation', 'X', 'Sorry', 'film', 'substance', 'poignancy', 'great', 'stellar', 'cast', 'film', 'one', 'recognizable', 'name', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'forty-', 'seven', 'not', 'exactly', 'thirties', 'being', 'petty', 'film', ""'d"", 'have', 'simply', 'describe', 'one', 'big', 'hangover', 'never', 'cured', 'entire', 'premise', 'one', 'last', 'party', 'amongst', 'friends', 'house', 'just', 'be', 'market', 'be', 'sold', 'next', 'day.The', 'first', 'scene', 'heroine', 'waking', 'up', 'bed', 'hung-over', 'used', 'condom', 'Welcome', 'plot', 'rest', 'film', 'various', 'party', 'members', 'pulling', 'together', 'talking', 'night', 'house', 'so', 'overly', 'party', 'damaged', 'big', 'cartoon', 'Bras', 'clothing', 'beer', 'kegs', 'adult', 'toys', 'booze', 'bottles', 'empty', 'pizza', 'boxes', 'anything', 'else', 'crew', 'could', 'toss', 'everywhere', 'more', 'entire', 'college', 'campus', 'had', 'party', 'one', 'house', 'less', 'dozen', 'so', 'actors', 'dialogue', 'common', 'pedestrian', 'boring', 'juvenile', 'malignant', 'simply', 'connection', 'characters', 'single', 'moment', 'humorous', 'language', 'foul', 'Not', 'problem', 'other', 'simply', 'foul', 'be', 'foul', 'relevance', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'actually', 'painful', 'watch', 'conversations', 'try', 'speak', 'meaningful', 'moments', 'past', 'are', 'petty', 'adolescent', 'None', 'conversations', 'go', 'meaningful', 'direction', 'simply', 'beginning', 'middle', 'part', 'end', 'none', 'minor', 'soundtrack', 'attached', 'little', 'ambience', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'never', 'even', 'made', 'compact', 'disc', 'called', 'Lather', 'Effect', 'appropriate', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'watching', 'debacle', 'money-waster', 'felt', 'needed', 'long', 'shower.To', 'use', 'quote', 'can', 'eat', 'can', 'Kodak', 'puke', 'better', 'movie', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'Mirror', 'Crack', ""'d""]",N/A

The characters, then, are hard to sympathize with, because we feel like latecomers to the drama ""already in progress.""The opening third of the film basically wastes ALOT of time with the crew talking, making unnecessarily lewd jokes, and whining about how they can't go back to high school.  The lead character, Valinda, seems particularly stuck in the past.  Her husband, thankfully, finally begins to show signs of realizing that the party was fun and all, but its time to clean up and get back to being responsible again.  But, Valinda and cast continue to reminisce and decide to let the party continue for a second night.FINALLY in the last act do we start to learn some of the hidden secrets that are the root of these wistful feelings.  The final portion of the story goes a long way toward bringing the film back on track as Valinda, her husband, and one of the other couples suddenly realize they have an important issue to tackle that will allow all of them to continue with their lives without constantly wondering ""what could have been.""Whereas BIG CHILL dealt with the process of growing older and taking on responsibility, LATHER focuses more on revisiting past choices and exploring what might have changed.  I think in the end there is a good lesson about not getting wrapped up in the past.People will have different reactions to this movie based on their opinion of their own high school experience.  Those who really enjoyed high school may do well to explore this myth of nostalgia with these characters.  Those who abhorred that period of their lives (like myself) will more likely identify with Valinda's husband, telling the rest of the crew that they are nuts for wanting to ""go back.""Whatever your reaction, you will find that the film is well-acted (for the most part) and well staged.  My only complaint is that the front end is too long with repetitive conversations.  I'd have rather gotten to know more about some of the other characters.However, I also think this film represents a serious missed opportunity in that this would have been a GREAT project to reunite the original 80s Brat Pack (Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy . . .) Perhaps they tried to make it happen, I don't know, but I couldn't help but think how much more interesting the movie would have been with them in it.  Much more nostalgiac and meaningful.The film is not rated, but would definitely have been rated R for strong language and ongoing sexual anecdotes.",3,The Blather Effect . . .,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,3033,"['once', 'description', 'product', 'correct', 'bit', 'attempt', 'make', 'BIG', 'CHILL', '80s', 'generation', 'film', 'CHILL', 'polish', 'maturity', ""n't"", 'merits.The', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'gathered', 'reunion/party', 'say', 'HAS', 'gathered', 'start', 'film', 'smack', 'middle', 'reunion', 'weekend', 'first', 'morning', 'were', 'such', 'film', 'bit', 'rocky', 'start', 'characters', 'refer', 'events', 'just', 'happened', 'last', 'night', 'rather', 'actually', 'seeing', 'happen', 'characters', 'then', 'are', 'hard', 'sympathize', 'feel', 'latecomers', 'drama', 'already', 'progress', 'opening', 'third', 'film', 'basically', 'ALOT', 'time', 'crew', 'talking', 'making', 'unnecessarily', 'lewd', 'jokes', 'whining', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'lead', 'character', 'Valinda', 'particularly', 'stuck', 'past', 'husband', 'thankfully', 'finally', 'show', 'signs', 'realizing', 'party', 'was', 'fun', 'time', 'clean', 'up', 'get', 'back', 'being', 'responsible', 'again', 'Valinda', 'cast', 'continue', 'reminisce', 'decide', 'let', 'party', 'continue', 'second', 'night.FINALLY', 'last', 'act', 'do', 'start', 'learn', 'hidden', 'secrets', 'are', 'root', 'wistful', 'feelings', 'final', 'portion', 'story', 'long', 'way', 'bringing', 'film', 'back', 'track', 'Valinda', 'husband', 'one', 'other', 'couples', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'have', 'important', 'issue', 'tackle', 'will', 'allow', 'continue', 'lives', 'constantly', 'wondering', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Whereas', 'BIG', 'CHILL', 'process', 'growing', 'older', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'LATHER', 'more', 'revisiting', 'past', 'choices', 'exploring', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'changed', 'think', 'end', 'good', 'lesson', 'not', 'getting', 'wrapped', 'up', 'past.People', 'will', 'have', 'different', 'reactions', 'movie', 'based', 'opinion', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'who', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'high', 'school', 'may', 'do', 'well', 'explore', 'myth', 'nostalgia', 'characters', 'who', 'abhorred', 'period', 'lives', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'identify', 'Valinda', 'husband', 'telling', 'rest', 'crew', 'are', 'nuts', 'wanting', 'go', 'back', 'reaction', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'well-acted', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'staged', 'only', 'complaint', 'front', 'end', 'too', 'long', 'repetitive', 'conversations', ""'d"", 'have', 'rather', 'gotten', 'know', 'more', 'other', 'characters.However', 'also', 'think', 'film', 'serious', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'GREAT', 'project', 'reunite', 'original', '80s', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'Perhaps', 'tried', 'make', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Much', 'more', 'nostalgiac', 'meaningful.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'been', 'rated', 'R', 'strong', 'language', 'ongoing', 'sexual', 'anecdotes']",N/A

This movie falls into that type of category; low-key, lots of dialogue, characters learning a bit about themselves as well as each other.  The trouble is, despite some nice performances, the movie really left little impression on me.  The story, what little there is, centers on a group of friends in their late-30s trying to relive a little of their '80s-era glory days.  The movie begins the morning after a big '80s-nostalgia themed party.  The various participants have been friends for years. Clearly these people are resisting the aging process and the possibility (probability, in fact) that the time has come to grow up.  Everyone is hung over, either from drinking or other substances (or a combination).  They sit around, while ostensibly cleaning up the trashed house, and talk about the old days.The biggest strength of the movie is it's ensemble cast - some of whom you are likely to know by name (Eric Stolz in particular, possibly Ione Skye) while others will undoubtedly be familiar (William Mapother, for instance). The dialogue has an easy-going, relaxed feel.  The trouble for me was that none of the characters were especially likable, no matter how convincingly portrayed.  They came across as self-indulgent jerks, for the most part.  No emotional investment developed over the course of the movie.The soundtrack - highly touted on the DVD cover - is comprised of '80s hits.  It is indeed an impressive collection of various radio classics from that era.

The people you spent 8 hours a day, 5 days a week with.  The ones whom shaped who you became as a person.  And the ones that always told you to follow your dreams.  The people that are always a crystal cream picture of yourself unjaded and ready for anything the world could possible send you.Fast forwards 20 years and those 4 years of test cramming, first kisses, and literal lessons have all become nothing but the past.  A couple of collective memories of empowerment and like everything was under control.And this is the basis of this movie.  A group of high school friends want to reunite 20 years after there graduation date.  But instead of being reminded of how the years have aged them, they want to truly have a night of forever young.  So they all come to a party just like they were 20 years ago in 1987.And like any good ""time of your life"" film: secrets are revealed, lost lovers reunited, and life lessons are truly learned.

The movie was marketed with the tagline of  ""A BIG CHILL for Generation X"" and though the movie shares some characteristics with that movie, THE LATHER EFFECT is more like a slow drain to nowhere.The plot follows a group of high school friends reunited about fifteen years after their graduation.  Valinda (Connie Britton) is selling her parents' home and holds a huge 1980s-themed party two nights before the buyers of the house are to arrive to sign the papers and officially take ownership of the home.  The movie begins the morning after the massive party and only the core group of high school friends remains at the house. The movie follows the group as they extend their reunion one day longer.  Before they leave, each person will have faced their past and in their own way moved into a more positive state of living in the present. You can't change the past, but you can change the future by how you live in the presentThe movie has an amazing talented group of actors who really bring their characters to life. Despite this, Eric Stoltz is the one member of the cast who really stands out.  He plays Mickey, a guy from down the street.  Mickey graduated years before the other people at Valinda's party and barely knew them.  He lives in a state of arrested adolescence, but it is his comments and reactions that are the heart of the movie.  His character seems like a middle-aged man trying to live like a teenager, but has more wisdom than the rest of the characters in the cast combined. However, Stoltz is basically playing the same role he played once before, Chet in Noah Baumbach's KICKING AND SCREAMING, which illustrates everything that is wrong about THE LATHER EFFECT.  Like the so-called principle discussed in the movie, everything in THE LATHER EFFECT feels like something done before, but it's not as good the second-time around and is just full of little bubbles of empty air.Besides the usual director commentary, the DVD features a few other special features including ""The Making of THE LATHER EFFECT"" featurette, deleted scenes, a segment with/about director Sarah Kelly entitled ""The Cameron Effect"", and ""The Importance of Being An Earnest PA"" featurette, as well as trailers for other Anchor Bay films.  Having viewed the extras I have to say I really like director & co-writer Sarah Kelly.  She seems like a person I would really enjoy working with and/or for.  I particularly enjoyed ""The Cameron Effect"" and ""The Importance of Being An Earnest PA"".  In ""The Cameron Effect"" Sarah gushes about Cameron Crowe and his published promise that he ""might"" attend a day of filming of THE LATHER EFFECT. Kelly is adorable in the segment.  ""The Importance of Being An Earnest PA"" features some of the PAs from THE LATHER EFFECT discussing their experiences as well as director Kelly and Eric Stoltz discussing their experiences as PAs and how invaluable it was to their careers.  PAs often get a bad rap, but the featurette illustrates how essential PAs are to the filmmaking process.",3,Waxing 1980s Nostalgia,1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,3098,"['LATHER', 'EFFECT', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'actors', 'great', '1980s', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'was', 'marketed', 'tagline', 'A', 'BIG', 'CHILL', 'Generation', 'X', 'movie', 'shares', 'characteristics', 'movie', 'THE', 'LATHER', 'EFFECT', 'more', 'slow', 'drain', 'nowhere.The', 'plot', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'reunited', 'fifteen', 'years', 'graduation', 'Valinda', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'selling', 'parents', 'home', 'huge', '1980s-themed', 'party', 'two', 'nights', 'buyers', 'house', 'are', 'arrive', 'sign', 'papers', 'officially', 'take', 'ownership', 'home', 'movie', 'morning', 'massive', 'party', 'only', 'core', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'house', 'movie', 'group', 'extend', 'reunion', 'one', 'day', 'longer', 'leave', 'person', 'will', 'have', 'faced', 'past', 'own', 'way', 'moved', 'more', 'positive', 'state', 'living', 'present', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'past', 'can', 'change', 'future', 'how', 'live', 'presentThe', 'movie', 'amazing', 'talented', 'group', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'one', 'member', 'cast', 'who', 'really', 'out', 'Mickey', 'guy', 'street', 'Mickey', 'graduated', 'years', 'other', 'people', 'Valinda', 'party', 'barely', 'knew', 'state', 'arrested', 'adolescence', 'comments', 'reactions', 'are', 'heart', 'movie', 'character', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'trying', 'live', 'teenager', 'more', 'wisdom', 'rest', 'characters', 'cast', 'combined', 'However', 'Stoltz', 'basically', 'playing', 'same', 'role', 'played', 'once', 'before', 'Chet', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'KICKING', 'SCREAMING', 'everything', 'wrong', 'THE', 'LATHER', 'EFFECT', 'so-called', 'principle', 'discussed', 'movie', 'everything', 'THE', 'LATHER', 'EFFECT', 'feels', 'something', 'done', 'before', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'second-time', 'around', 'just', 'full', 'little', 'bubbles', 'empty', 'usual', 'director', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'few', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'Making', 'THE', 'LATHER', 'EFFECT', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'segment', 'with/about', 'director', 'Sarah', 'Kelly', 'entitled', 'Cameron', 'Effect', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'PA', 'featurette', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'other', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'films', 'Having', 'viewed', 'extras', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Sarah', 'Kelly', 'person', 'would', 'really', 'enjoy', 'working', 'and/or', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Cameron', 'Effect', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'PA', 'Cameron', 'Effect', 'Sarah', 'gushes', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'published', 'promise', 'might', 'attend', 'day', 'filming', 'THE', 'LATHER', 'EFFECT', 'Kelly', 'adorable', 'segment', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'PA', 'PAs', 'THE', 'LATHER', 'EFFECT', 'discussing', 'experiences', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'Kelly', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'discussing', 'experiences', 'PAs', 'how', 'invaluable', 'was', 'careers', 'PAs', 'often', 'get', 'bad', 'rap', 'featurette', 'how', 'essential', 'PAs', 'are', 'filmmaking', 'process']",N/A
