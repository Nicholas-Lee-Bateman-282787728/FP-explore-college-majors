173681,A38UW5G6DXPDT1,1417068329,12Junes,"[4, 9]","What a tedious film. I bought this film thinking it would be interesting - and I love a mystery. It took me a while to figure out the characters are in HS because there is never a scene that takes place in class.  What was that theater group about? And that strange Halloween party with the cryptic ""performances"" - where did that take place? Some rich kid's house with the parents gone?Half the time I could not hear, let alone understand the use of English...if it was English. After the first 15 minutes, I started fast forwarding through the movie and just watched the scenes. You can pretty much get the idea of this movie without hearing a single word. It was like a bunch of young Californites with too much money and time on their hands decided to make a film that would piss of their parents.The main antagonists in the movie are masochists doped out on lithium or pot - maybe both. The only parent is portrayed as an oblivious  ""Leave it to Beaver"" pleaser.  The only other authority figure is a vice principal who comes across as narcotics detective negotiating with his street contact. I hate to imagine meeting any of the characters portrayed in this film. I obviously do not fit into the category of audience that this film targets. Thank goodness I only paid $3.00 for it at the local Big Lots.",2,Another planet?,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,1309,"['What', 'tedious', 'film', 'bought', 'film', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'love', 'mystery', 'took', 'while', 'figure', 'out', 'characters', 'are', 'HS', 'never', 'scene', 'place', 'class', 'What', 'was', 'theater', 'group', 'strange', 'Halloween', 'party', 'cryptic', 'performances', 'where', 'did', 'take', 'place', 'rich', 'kid', 'house', 'parents', 'gone', 'time', 'could', 'not', 'hear', 'let', 'alone', 'understand', 'use', 'English', 'was', 'English', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'started', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'movie', 'just', 'watched', 'scenes', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'idea', 'movie', 'hearing', 'single', 'word', 'was', 'bunch', 'young', 'Californites', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'time', 'hands', 'decided', 'make', 'film', 'would', 'piss', 'parents.The', 'main', 'antagonists', 'movie', 'are', 'masochists', 'doped', 'out', 'lithium', 'pot', 'maybe', 'only', 'parent', 'portrayed', 'oblivious', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'pleaser', 'only', 'other', 'authority', 'figure', 'vice', 'principal', 'who', 'narcotics', 'detective', 'negotiating', 'street', 'contact', 'hate', 'imagine', 'meeting', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'film', 'obviously', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'category', 'audience', 'film', 'targets', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'only', 'paid', '3.00', 'local', 'Big', 'Lots']",N/A

Belonging or not belonging to a clique or gang can bring horrible expectations--ones that aren't easy to fulfill.  Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an outsider, the way many outsiders are, but he is different.  Brendan is devoted to his love, Emily Kostich, and will do anything to protect her.  When she brushes off his love interest, she puts herself in harm's way.  She is killed and Brendan finds her washed in a creek near an underground tunnel.  From here he becomes Generation Next's Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) with all the resident toughness of the private eye, willing to get beat up to get some answers and meet the teenage equivalent of a head mobster, ""The Pin"" (Lukas Haas), whose presence is quiet, yet formidable.  His dress is with a cloak and he has a walking stick, making him a dead ringer for Barnabas Collins in the old vampire serial 'Dark Shadows'.  The gap bridge is between himself and ""Tug,"" a Pin thug who pummels Brendan until he is impressed enough to let him into his lair.  The young actors are so convincing that you get the impression that the high school they populate is one big, organized crime syndicate.  One sharp scene is where Brendan roughly negotiates with the school Vice Principal (Richard Roundtree of the first 'Shaft' film fame).  In the midst of the murder there are love interests and notes that provide clues in Brendan's investigation.'Brick' is the little film that could--or one that can and does.  It is gripping and has all the anticipation of a whodunit with some violent, but convincing fight scenes.  Hardly a video game, the violence makes us feel every punch, like it was our own.  It is an artful enterprise with editing and music that underscores the nerve-wracking atmosphere of the movie.  We can feel the room spinning as Brendan looks up to his bedroom ceiling fan.  There is some needed irreverence to boot.  When ""The Pin""'s mom dotes over whether Brendan is sure about wanting apple juice for breakfast, we have to laugh.  'Brick' is an effective and often startling teenage murder mystery with a earnest cast and an intelligent script.  Rian Johnston deserves praises for his screenplay and directing skill.",4,Hits You Like a Ton of...Bricks,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,2213,"['not', 'easy', 'being', 'teenager', 'Belonging', 'not', 'belonging', 'clique', 'gang', 'can', 'bring', 'horrible', 'expectations', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'easy', 'fulfill', 'Brendan', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'outsider', 'way', 'many', 'outsiders', 'are', 'different', 'Brendan', 'devoted', 'love', 'Emily', 'Kostich', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'When', 'love', 'interest', 'harm', 'way', 'killed', 'Brendan', 'washed', 'creek', 'underground', 'tunnel', 'here', 'Generation', 'Next', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'resident', 'toughness', 'private', 'eye', 'willing', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'get', 'answers', 'meet', 'teenage', 'equivalent', 'head', 'mobster', 'Pin', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'presence', 'quiet', 'yet', 'formidable', 'dress', 'cloak', 'walking', 'stick', 'making', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'old', 'vampire', 'serial', 'Shadows', 'gap', 'bridge', 'Tug', 'Pin', 'thug', 'who', 'Brendan', 'impressed', 'enough', 'let', 'lair', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'convincing', 'get', 'impression', 'high', 'school', 'populate', 'one', 'big', 'organized', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'One', 'sharp', 'scene', 'where', 'Brendan', 'roughly', 'school', 'Vice', 'Principal', 'Richard', 'Roundtree', 'first', ""'Shaft"", 'film', 'fame', 'midst', 'murder', 'are', 'love', 'interests', 'notes', 'provide', 'clues', 'Brendan', 'investigation', 'little', 'film', 'could', 'one', 'can', 'gripping', 'anticipation', 'whodunit', 'violent', 'convincing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Hardly', 'video', 'game', 'violence', 'feel', 'punch', 'was', 'own', 'artful', 'enterprise', 'editing', 'music', 'nerve-wracking', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'can', 'feel', 'room', 'spinning', 'Brendan', 'up', 'bedroom', 'ceiling', 'fan', 'needed', 'irreverence', 'boot', 'When', 'Pin', 'mom', 'Brendan', 'sure', 'wanting', 'apple', 'juice', 'breakfast', 'have', 'laugh', 'effective', 'often', 'startling', 'teenage', 'murder', 'mystery', 'earnest', 'cast', 'intelligent', 'script', 'Rian', 'Johnston', 'praises', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'skill']",N/A

173684,A23L2BR07AOBG1,1417068329,alex bushman,"[6, 7]","To all you casual movie fans out there, you shouldn't pay any mind into the film geeks who take so much time showing you their fancy vocabulary.  After all, a good review is one that simulataneously speaks your impressions and tries to be useful to others. As such I will say that this film will not be appealing to a number of people for a few reasons1)Many feel that film noir is out-dated and should be put out to pasture for good.2)There are people out there who absoltely love film noir of the past and completely reject the modern versions of them3)The characters and coventions of film noirs are meant to walk the line of unrealistic stereotypes and still hold out the intention that this story could happen to anyone.4)The fact this involves primarily high schoolers will turn off the hard core fans, confuse casual filmgoers, and live on as a maligned attempt at a new school noir.To those who can get past any those will have a film that plays with the conventions it's handed and comes out pretty good, even though the ending isn't as detective-worthy as you'd think. Yes, Brandon is a convention of the story, but so is everyone in the story we call life. Does he have realistic qualities to his character and is what happens to him possible for others as well? Yes.  The movie, like all noirs, plays it tough and doesn't really give you a lot of character development, the only real glimpse into why Brandon is what he is is shown in the film as a flashback.  As a character says to him ""you're thick"" meaning that he's got an internal temper that won't allow him to give things up easily and that's the key to the story of his character.  I find the story realistic, high schools are battle grounds where violence can and does take place, both in the limelight and out. Do kids deal drugs? Are you kidding? For those who can't suspend their disbelief, it just goes to show you that the film presents a fiction and reality that some people just can't take. The film isn't a masterpiece, but for breaking some ground in the noir genre, it more than makes up for its deficiencies. It's funny, cleverly plays around the conventions and contains textbook noir performances which are more reliant on wordplay than expression, although a little more expression would be nice.

173685,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1417068329,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","`Brick' is one of those films that has aged very well with me.  I remember when I first say it and I really liked it a lot.  Over time I had forgotten just how much I liked this until I happened to catch it a while back and became instantly absorbed in it once again.  With dialog as fresh and sharp as the words expressed in `Juno', yet more residual thanks to the noir'ish themes, `Brick' just `gets it'.I love the feel of `Brick'.  This is a film that knows what it wants to be.  It indulges in and totally embraces the thickly detailed atmosphere that makes it stand alone, apart from comparables.  The film never feels amateurish or `silly'.  Instead, it balances the absurd details of the surroundings by elevating the core themes, keeping each character believable as apposed to a cleverly inserted caricature.Rian Johnson is just, well, awesome.Taking place mainly on school grounds, `Brick' tells the story of Brendan, a curious teen who gets a message from his girlfriend claiming to need help.  Taking that message and running with it, Brendan finds himself deep in high-school crime, and when his girlfriend shows up dead, things get even stickier for Brendan as he meets and evaluates a variety of teens dwelling in the school's underbelly.  Drugs and murder fester as Brendan steps closer to the truth, eluded by a mysterious girl named Laura and a drug kingpin known as The Pin.Thank you Joseph Gordon-Levitt for being the acting god that you are.  I can't wait for the whole world to embrace you as `the next best thing' and for you to completely make the cinematic world your breeding grounds.  Seriously, is there anything this kid can't do?  As Brendan, Gordon-Levitt adds so much weight to the films premise, aiding Brendan with a subtle edge that makes him believable and relatable.  Megan Good and Mike O'Leary are also great; but it is Nora Zehetner, as rich girl Laura, who stays with me the longest.  She was just outstanding, layering her characters mysteriousness with richly conceived moments that spark our interest.Thanks to a poetic script and a sharp directorial eye, `Brick' is the new age noir that understands how to pay homage without feeling like a cheaply disguised copycat.  No, this is not the best noir ever (as some presumptuous teens have tried to claim) but it is one of the smartest takes on the genre in years.  The noir is a hard genre to master, but `Brick' just oozes with enough charm and originality to take the cake here.Fascinating is a word that best describes this film.",5,It gets better and better...,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,2525,"['Brick', 'one', 'films', 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'lot', 'time', 'had', 'forgotten', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'happened', 'catch', 'while', 'back', 'became', 'instantly', 'absorbed', 'once', 'again', 'dialog', 'fresh', 'sharp', 'words', 'expressed', 'Juno', 'yet', 'more', 'residual', 'thanks', ""noir'ish"", 'themes', 'Brick', 'just', ""it'.I"", 'feel', 'Brick', 'film', 'what', 'be', 'totally', 'thickly', 'detailed', 'atmosphere', 'stand', 'alone', 'apart', 'comparables', 'film', 'never', 'amateurish', 'silly', 'Instead', 'absurd', 'details', 'surroundings', 'elevating', 'core', 'themes', 'keeping', 'character', 'believable', 'apposed', 'cleverly', 'inserted', 'caricature.Rian', 'Johnson', 'just', 'well', 'awesome.Taking', 'place', 'mainly', 'school', 'grounds', 'Brick', 'story', 'Brendan', 'curious', 'teen', 'who', 'message', 'girlfriend', 'claiming', 'need', 'help', 'Taking', 'message', 'running', 'Brendan', 'deep', 'high-school', 'crime', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'up', 'dead', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'stickier', 'Brendan', 'variety', 'teens', 'dwelling', 'school', 'underbelly', 'Drugs', 'murder', 'fester', 'Brendan', 'closer', 'truth', 'eluded', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'named', 'Laura', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'known', 'Pin.Thank', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'being', 'acting', 'god', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'whole', 'world', 'embrace', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'completely', 'make', 'cinematic', 'world', 'breeding', 'grounds', 'Seriously', 'there', 'anything', 'kid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Brendan', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'so', 'much', 'weight', 'films', 'premise', 'aiding', 'Brendan', 'subtle', 'edge', 'believable', 'relatable', 'Megan', 'Good', 'Mike', ""O'Leary"", 'are', 'also', 'great', 'Nora', 'Zehetner', 'rich', 'girl', 'Laura', 'who', 'longest', 'was', 'just', 'outstanding', 'layering', 'characters', 'mysteriousness', 'richly', 'conceived', 'moments', 'spark', 'interest.Thanks', 'poetic', 'script', 'sharp', 'directorial', 'eye', 'Brick', 'new', 'age', 'noir', 'how', 'pay', 'homage', 'feeling', 'cheaply', 'disguised', 'copycat', 'No', 'not', 'best', 'noir', 'ever', 'presumptuous', 'teens', 'have', 'tried', 'claim', 'one', 'smartest', 'genre', 'years', 'noir', 'hard', 'genre', 'master', 'Brick', 'just', 'enough', 'charm', 'originality', 'take', 'cake', 'here.Fascinating', 'word', 'best', 'film']",N/A

173687,A37YYE73XR83FI,1417068329,"Anthony P. ""Inspiring Mind""","[3, 4]","I was very much surprised(in a GOOD way) by this film and only picked up on it after being smitten by the actress who plays Laura(Nora Zehetner), who also happens to be playing one of the special people on NBC's Heroes. When popular critics gave their televised reviews, I was not impressed and only slightly curious.  The mere mention of the kid from Third Rock From the Sun(Gordon-Levitt) and a plot about teens and drugs turned my stomach.  It was only the hint of a story like something from the library of Humphrey Bogart--standing under a lamppost with his tan trenchcoat and fedora while waiting for the dame in the red dress to appear with her side of the story--that made interested.But, alas, I did not get to see the film in the theater. Aside from all the artsy ""Noir"" talk--of course this is classified and independent/Sundance film--this movie slipped through my fingers like water on a turtle's back in the summer.  Did that make any sense to you?  Try a whole two hours of chatter like that as fast as you can pronounce the words and understanding all the metaphors. [It helped to put subtitles/captions on and watch the film more than once to catch/comprehend all the lines.] The music is haunting and intoxicating, and the characters are as classical and perfectly cast as they are laughable. The more I watched, the more I was mezmerized. It truly becomes addictive like a drug.Brick is reminiscent of such films as Pulp Fiction and just about any of Leonardo DeCaprio's films--particularly his rendition of Romeo and Juliet but with the personalities of a classic black and white detective story(minus the typewriter in the office).  Visually, it appears like a Type A artsy, high school, independent film--and almost locks itself outside the mainstream world.  Had the dialogue been slower and less intelligent for the characters delivering it, the movie might have garnered a wider audience(although the number of reviews for this film here alone shows a rather large underground audience).  Or, I wouldn't have minded if the characters and scenario DID resemble the classic detective films more, like Dick Tracy(Warren Beaty 1990)-style.  Putting a teen peer pressure story together with a Bogart movie seems rather silly, but I will admit to my own amazement.  One of the problems with memory-intensive lines is that you often lose quality of acting/emotion.  And, this film DOES suffer an emptiness of character depth--with the exception of the trampish Kara and the ""pot-skulled reef-worm with more hop in his head than blood,"" Dode.  But, this film has potential.The DVD bonuses are few, but you get a few surprises and glimpses into the minds of the director and cast.  You see the amateur skills/mistakes of film making as well as an extended rendition of a curious poem given a sly read by Nora herself--and this piece is also on the CD Soundtrack(there are also a few insightful images of the actress and her audition tape.The SOUNDTRACK is a set of 40 pieces mainly composed by the artsy direction of (unknown to me) Nathan Johnson which includes the few potent tracks I really liked. [Emily's theme--aka the main theme--with its haunting cowbells and Laura's theme--aka the smooth detective/seductress lounge music are among the best for both casual parties and background music for other films of this nature.  About half of the CD contains other pieces which sound more like a man experimenting with pots, pans and soda cans in his kitchen and calling it a symphony.] Bonus: Put the CD in your computer's CD-ROM drive and get your own downloadable doseable brick(just kidding). I have only rented the film so far and sampled the soundtrack, but I plan on buying both.",4,A GOOD surprise---debateable but very addictive and buy-able,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,3702,"['was', 'very', 'much', 'surprised', 'GOOD', 'way', 'film', 'only', 'picked', 'up', 'being', 'smitten', 'actress', 'who', 'Laura', 'Nora', 'Zehetner', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'playing', 'one', 'special', 'people', 'NBC', 'Heroes', 'When', 'popular', 'critics', 'gave', 'televised', 'reviews', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'only', 'slightly', 'curious', 'mere', 'mention', 'kid', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'plot', 'teens', 'drugs', 'turned', 'stomach', 'was', 'only', 'hint', 'story', 'something', 'library', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'standing', 'lamppost', 'tan', 'trenchcoat', 'fedora', 'waiting', 'dame', 'red', 'dress', 'appear', 'side', 'story', 'made', 'interested.But', 'alas', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'film', 'theater', 'Aside', 'artsy', 'Noir', 'talk', 'course', 'classified', 'independent/Sundance', 'film', 'movie', 'slipped', 'fingers', 'water', 'turtle', 'back', 'summer', 'Did', 'make', 'sense', 'Try', 'whole', 'two', 'hours', 'chatter', 'like', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'pronounce', 'words', 'understanding', 'metaphors', '[', 'helped', 'put', 'subtitles/captions', 'watch', 'film', 'more', 'once', 'catch/comprehend', 'lines', ']', 'music', 'haunting', 'intoxicating', 'characters', 'are', 'classical', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'are', 'laughable', 'more', 'watched', 'more', 'was', 'mezmerized', 'truly', 'addictive', 'drug.Brick', 'reminiscent', 'such', 'films', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'just', 'Leonardo', 'DeCaprio', 'films', 'particularly', 'rendition', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'personalities', 'classic', 'black', 'white', 'detective', 'story', 'typewriter', 'office', 'Visually', 'Type', 'A', 'artsy', 'high', 'school', 'independent', 'film', 'almost', 'locks', 'mainstream', 'world', 'Had', 'dialogue', 'been', 'slower', 'less', 'intelligent', 'characters', 'delivering', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'garnered', 'wider', 'audience', 'number', 'reviews', 'film', 'here', 'alone', 'rather', 'large', 'underground', 'audience', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'characters', 'scenario', 'DID', 'resemble', 'classic', 'detective', 'films', 'more', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'Warren', 'Beaty', '1990', '-style', 'Putting', 'teen', 'peer', 'pressure', 'story', 'together', 'Bogart', 'movie', 'rather', 'silly', 'will', 'admit', 'own', 'amazement', 'One', 'problems', 'memory-intensive', 'lines', 'often', 'lose', 'quality', 'acting/emotion', 'film', 'DOES', 'suffer', 'emptiness', 'character', 'depth', 'exception', 'trampish', 'Kara', 'pot-skulled', 'reef-worm', 'more', 'hop', 'head', 'blood', 'Dode', 'film', 'potential.The', 'DVD', 'bonuses', 'are', 'few', 'get', 'few', 'surprises', 'glimpses', 'minds', 'director', 'cast', 'see', 'amateur', 'skills/mistakes', 'film', 'making', 'as', 'well', 'extended', 'rendition', 'curious', 'poem', 'given', 'sly', 'read', 'Nora', 'piece', 'also', 'CD', 'Soundtrack', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'insightful', 'images', 'actress', 'audition', 'tape.The', 'SOUNDTRACK', 'set', '40', 'pieces', 'mainly', 'composed', 'artsy', 'direction', 'unknown', 'Nathan', 'Johnson', 'few', 'potent', 'tracks', 'really', 'liked', 'Emily', 'theme', 'main', 'theme', 'haunting', 'cowbells', 'Laura', 'theme', 'smooth', 'detective/seductress', 'lounge', 'music', 'are', 'best', 'casual', 'parties', 'background', 'music', 'other', 'films', 'nature', 'half', 'CD', 'other', 'pieces', 'sound', 'more', 'man', 'experimenting', 'pots', 'pans', 'soda', 'cans', 'kitchen', 'calling', 'symphony', ']', 'Bonus', 'Put', 'CD', 'computer', 'CD-ROM', 'drive', 'get', 'own', 'downloadable', 'doseable', 'brick', 'just', 'kidding', 'have', 'only', 'rented', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'sampled', 'soundtrack', 'plan', 'buying']",N/A

This statement comes straight from director Rian Johnson and never have truer words been spoken. The language is strong, forceful and brilliant, and the settings dark, drug-infected, and noirish, harkening back to Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon.Being one of his first feature films, Rian Johnson has struck gold with this indie movie, making us wonder what he could accomplish with a larger budget (BRICK was made on less than $500,000).The story seems pedestrian enough. A high schooler named Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, 3rd Rock from the Sun) takes it upon himself to investigate the death of his former girlfriend Emily (Emilie de Ravin, LOST). The discoveries launch Brendan into dark corners where drugs, thugs, and friends combine to form a triangle of deadly proportions. Pulling heavily from noir films of old, this updated look and story has a unique place amongst the genre. Brendan's niche group cares nothing for cheerleading squads or who's dating who. The level of sophistication is upped to extreme levels, showing us a danger and intellect amongst the teen population never before seen on celluloid.The noir comparisons are the most fascinating. The cloudy skies, telephone booths, and shadowy locales give an underpinning sense of dread, much like films from the 30s and 40s. There's even a piano playing portion that obviously pays homage to the ""Play it again, Sam"" lovers.Shot on location at San Clemente High School (the directors alma mater) and edited on a home computer, this amazing flick will win audiences over with its wonderful camera angles, dark themes and excellent script. The acting, too, is well done with Joseph Gordon-Levitt appearing in every scene and pulling the quality of the entire production even higher.My only gripe is the sound. Editing must've been tough and several times lines were garbled or mumbled, making it necessary to rewind and find out what was said.Watch out Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Howard.

173696,AWNKEM8DAG8PY,1417068329,Brian Conway,"[3, 8]","Expertly avoiding the clich&eacute;s of the well-worn noir genre, Rian Johnson's Brick has one of the most interesting premises in years. By setting his twisty noir tale in a modern day high school, Rian Johnson has breathed fresh life into a style long thought dead. The fact that the setting and style fit together so well ends up being quite a pay off and makes the story that much more intriguing and enjoyable. Every so often there is a line of dialogue that seems a bit contrived for a high schooler to spit out, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt and company usually devlier these lines without any hitches, grounding the film firmly in reality. Gordon-Levitt is excellent as loner hero Brendan Fry and perfectly fits the noir detective archetype; his mannerisms and relentlessly tough-guy attitude seamlessly bridge the gap between the two worlds. Brendan's character calls to mind a number of noir heroes, but perhaps most interestingly is an homage to the protagonist of Miller's Crossing in a series of scenes that hilariously feature Brendan taking beating after beating in very quick succession. While most of the film maintains a slow, deliberate pace familiar to the genre, one scene in particular, in which Brendan is being chased by an unknown thug, is brilliantly directed and delievers a classic ""wow"" moment. The conclusion also features the watermark of its influences as it is fairly easy to predict the who, just not the why. However, this doesn't detract from the quality of the film; it just brings the whole experience to an appropriate close.

You'll know which by the end of the day tomorrow."" And, ""Drop me off at school.""Brick, an independent movie written and directed by Rian Johnson, is part stunt, part style and part energetic riff on gumshoe movies. Movie references are dropped like names but with more subtlety. It takes place in and around an affluent, sunny Southern California high school populated by the usual prom queens, rockers, vamps, brains, thugs and drug dealers. This is a Thirties gangster movie with all the clich&eacute;s, played straight but with almost everyone a teen. You have to keep asking yourself, is this just a parody? Well, not exactly. It's...it's...it's part stunt, part style and part energetic riff on gumshoe movies. Rian Johnson, who graduated from USC's School of Cinema-Television in 1996, knows what he's doing. The tough acting is deadpan; the dialogue is quick, clever and loaded with jargon; things are said so quickly you'd better keep track of context.What could have been just another tiresome melodrama of teen angst turns into a sort-of-serious crackpot tribute to old gangster movies. It works so well not just because Johnson is unusually gifted and slightly off the wall, but because of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays the tough-talking, resourceful and relentless Brendan Frye. He may be a teen, but Brendan also is Sam Spade, George Raft, the Continental Op, you name it. This particular homage covers a lot of Thirties ground. It all starts when Brendan, a classic high school loner, finds his former girl friend he still has feelings for is in trouble. She calls him and pleads for help. The next thing, she's killed running from Brendan and into a dark drainage pipe. Brendan's smart but not one for school rules or social niceties. He starts asking around and gets beaten up. He is determined to find out why Emily was killed and do justice to those responsible. His only ally is The Brain, a super nerd and friend who knows a lot and sometimes can link unexpected dots. Soon we meet Laura, a high school femme fatale who can afford excellent manicures; Kara, a drama queen who seems to have no heart and a fondness for manipulation; Dode, a high school greaser with a shiny pompadour who dresses in black and says, gee, I loved her, too; and Tug, a blonde muscle boy who combines the build and the temperament of an enthusiastic steroid aficionado. Tug's rages should be avoided. Brendan doesn't. Lurking behind Brendan's search for the ""why"" of Emily's death is The Pin (Lukas Haas), a young man about 26 who wears a black cape and uses a cane. He admires the Hobbit books. The Pin knows heroin pays a lot better than a community college Associate of Arts degree. The Pin has a basement office with cheap paneling and a mom who obliviously serves homemade cookies and apple juice to Brendan just after Tug, on The Pin's order, does a number on Brendan's face. Mom is a friendly sort without a clue to her son's activities. Her cookies look really good. I think they were raisin oatmeal.When Brendan figures things out and forces a violent, nasty, clever showdown, a lot of bad guys pay the price, with a betrayal Brendan will never forgive. For Brendan? Well, Emily will always have a place in his heart.Joseph Gordon-Levitt manages all this with complete assurance. He never winks at the audience. Those who saw him inThe Lookout(2007) know just how fine and authentic an actor he is.

173703,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,1417068329,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[4, 4]","In up and coming director Rian Johnson's film Brick, audiences are treated to a truly unique and memorable mystery film. Inspired by the literary work of the great detective novel writerDashiell Hammett, who is best known as the creator of Sam Spade and The Thin Man, Rian Johnson set out to create a hip, contemporary noir film. While simultaneously following in the footsteps of great mystery writers like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, Johnson succeeds in revitalizing the detective genre for a new generation, and he does so by making a drastic departure from the traditions of typical film noir. Rather than setting his story in a decaying metropolis full of smoky rooftops and shadowy alleyways, Johnson places the story and its characters in the suburbs of modern day Southern California. He transforms the hard-bitten stereotyped figures of pulp novels into world-weary teenagers and he updates the all-too-familiar dialogue of detective films, turning it into something more improvisational and poetic, almost as though the film's dialogue was part of a jazz song. Though the highly stylized dialogue limits the commercial accessibility of the film, it is arguably what gives the story its refreshing flavor. Using a combination of 1940s slang and modern pop terminologies, Johnson dislocates viewers from reality and relocates them in a ""shadow world"", where every darkness hides behind it a secret and every soul is haunted by their misdeeds. Yet somehow the film avoids pretension and self-importance, which is truly remarkable in itself.When Brendan, an anti-social and extremely street savvy high school senior, receives a distressed phone call from his ex-girlfriend, Emily, who cryptically asks him to help her, he doesn't know what to do. They had broken up a few short months earlier when Emily began hanging with the wrong crowd; the rich, the snotty, the over privileged and then the low-level drug dealers and a host of other less than savory peers. Brendan had tried to protect her from their corrupting influence, from their world of drugs, sex, and violence, but his efforts failed and Emily left him for a drug dealer named Dode. Now Brendan sees his chance to help her, to save her from self-destruction if it isn't already too late... but it is. Learning that Emily was meant to meet someone for a late night meeting in a tunnel, Brendan shows up hoping to talk to her. Instead he finds her dead body. After hiding her body, Brendan begins to set into action a plan to find those responsible for Emily's ""downfall"". Naturally Brendan, being somewhat of a lone wolf, doesn't have direct access to the same cliques that Emily did. He goes to his brilliantly resourceful friend, Brain, who seems to have the dirt on just about everyone in school. With Brain's help, Brendan infiltrates a world of drug dealers, of adolescent femme fatales, of snitches and sneaks, and of conspiracies. Soon the trail leads him to a local urban legend regarding a drug dealer known as The Pin (short for The Kingpin), who lives in his parents' basement. When Brendan finally makes his way into The Pin's circle and meets his ""hothead"" bodyguard Tug, and his slinky and seductive gal pal Laura, he has no clue of the level of danger and deception that surrounds him. As the intrigue is elevated so too are Brendan's troubles. It doesn't take him long to figure out that ""there's not much chance of coming out clean.""It should be pretty obvious that Brick is in no way an attempt to portray high school realistically. Rian Johnson has, in fact, succeeded in making high school even more oppressive and agonizing. Who knew that was even possible?Another great strength of the film is its use of atmospheric and highly evocative music. Thebeautifully haunting scorewas created by Rian Johnson's cousin, Nathan Johnson, who heightens the story's emotional subtext and the dramatic tension in a devastating manner.The film features a talented young cast including Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Brendan, Lukas Haas as The Pin, Noah Fleiss as Tug, Norah Zehetner as Laura, Matt O'Leary as Brain, Noah Segan as Dode, and Emilie de Ravin as Emily. The cast also features Meagan Good, and in a cameo role, Richard Roundtree ofShaftfame. The entire cast is really spectacular, especially when you consider the difficulty of delivering such strange, stylized dialogue with a sense of sincerity.Also recommended:The Maltese FalconRebel Without a CauseChinatownThe OutsidersThe Coen Brothers Movie CollectionRomeo + Juliet11:14",4,A Dark and Intricate High School Mystery,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,4520,"['up', 'coming', 'director', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'film', 'Brick', 'audiences', 'are', 'treated', 'truly', 'unique', 'memorable', 'mystery', 'film', 'Inspired', 'literary', 'work', 'great', 'detective', 'novel', 'writerDashiell', 'Hammett', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'creator', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'Thin', 'Man', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'set', 'out', 'create', 'hip', 'contemporary', 'noir', 'film', 'simultaneously', 'following', 'footsteps', 'great', 'mystery', 'writers', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'Johnson', 'revitalizing', 'detective', 'genre', 'new', 'generation', 'so', 'making', 'drastic', 'departure', 'traditions', 'typical', 'film', 'noir', 'Rather', 'setting', 'story', 'decaying', 'metropolis', 'full', 'smoky', 'rooftops', 'shadowy', 'alleyways', 'Johnson', 'story', 'characters', 'suburbs', 'modern', 'day', 'Southern', 'California', 'hard-bitten', 'stereotyped', 'figures', 'pulp', 'novels', 'world-weary', 'teenagers', 'all-too-familiar', 'dialogue', 'detective', 'films', 'turning', 'something', 'more', 'improvisational', 'poetic', 'almost', 'film', 'dialogue', 'was', 'part', 'jazz', 'song', 'highly', 'stylized', 'dialogue', 'commercial', 'accessibility', 'film', 'arguably', 'what', 'story', 'refreshing', 'flavor', 'Using', 'combination', '1940s', 'slang', 'modern', 'pop', 'terminologies', 'Johnson', 'viewers', 'reality', 'shadow', 'world', 'where', 'darkness', 'secret', 'soul', 'haunted', 'misdeeds', 'somehow', 'film', 'avoids', 'pretension', 'self-importance', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'itself.When', 'Brendan', 'anti-social', 'extremely', 'street', 'savvy', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'distressed', 'phone', 'call', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Emily', 'who', 'cryptically', 'help', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'had', 'broken', 'up', 'few', 'short', 'months', 'earlier', 'when', 'Emily', 'began', 'hanging', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'rich', 'snotty', 'over', 'privileged', 'then', 'low-level', 'drug', 'dealers', 'host', 'other', 'less', 'savory', 'peers', 'Brendan', 'had', 'tried', 'protect', 'corrupting', 'influence', 'world', 'drugs', 'sex', 'violence', 'efforts', 'failed', 'Emily', 'left', 'drug', 'dealer', 'named', 'Dode', 'Now', 'Brendan', 'chance', 'help', 'save', 'self-destruction', ""n't"", 'already', 'too', 'late', 'Learning', 'Emily', 'was', 'meant', 'meet', 'someone', 'late', 'night', 'meeting', 'tunnel', 'Brendan', 'up', 'hoping', 'talk', 'Instead', 'dead', 'body', 'hiding', 'body', 'Brendan', 'set', 'action', 'plan', 'find', 'responsible', 'Emily', 'downfall', 'Naturally', 'Brendan', 'being', 'somewhat', 'lone', 'wolf', ""n't"", 'have', 'direct', 'access', 'same', 'cliques', 'Emily', 'did', 'brilliantly', 'resourceful', 'friend', 'Brain', 'who', 'have', 'dirt', 'just', 'everyone', 'school', 'Brain', 'help', 'Brendan', 'world', 'drug', 'dealers', 'adolescent', 'femme', 'fatales', 'snitches', 'sneaks', 'conspiracies', 'Soon', 'trail', 'local', 'urban', 'legend', 'regarding', 'drug', 'dealer', 'known', 'Pin', 'short', 'Kingpin', 'who', 'parents', 'basement', 'When', 'Brendan', 'finally', 'way', 'Pin', 'circle', 'hothead', 'bodyguard', 'Tug', 'slinky', 'seductive', 'gal', 'pal', 'Laura', 'clue', 'level', 'danger', 'deception', 'intrigue', 'elevated', 'so', 'too', 'are', 'Brendan', 'troubles', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'not', 'much', 'chance', 'coming', 'out', 'clean', 'should', 'be', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Brick', 'way', 'attempt', 'portray', 'high', 'school', 'realistically', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'fact', 'succeeded', 'making', 'high', 'school', 'even', 'more', 'oppressive', 'agonizing', 'Who', 'knew', 'was', 'even', 'possible', 'great', 'strength', 'film', 'use', 'atmospheric', 'highly', 'evocative', 'music', 'Thebeautifully', 'haunting', 'scorewas', 'created', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'cousin', 'Nathan', 'Johnson', 'who', 'story', 'emotional', 'subtext', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'devastating', 'manner.The', 'film', 'talented', 'young', 'cast', 'including', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Brendan', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'Pin', 'Noah', 'Fleiss', 'Tug', 'Norah', 'Zehetner', 'Laura', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'Brain', 'Noah', 'Segan', 'Dode', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'Emily', 'cast', 'also', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'cameo', 'role', 'Richard', 'Roundtree', 'ofShaftfame', 'entire', 'cast', 'really', 'spectacular', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'difficulty', 'delivering', 'such', 'strange', 'stylized', 'dialogue', 'sense', 'sincerity.Also', 'recommended', 'Maltese', 'FalconRebel', 'CauseChinatownThe', 'OutsidersThe', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Movie', 'CollectionRomeo', '+', 'Juliet11:14']",N/A
173704,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,1417068329,Cubist,"[4, 6]","Rian Johnson's debut film Brick caused something of a minor sensation among critics and discerning cineastes earlier this year when it won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award, the John Cassavetes Award for the best film production with a budget under $500,000. Brick re-imagines high school life through a 1940s film noir lens as Johnson populates his film with terse, fast-talking characters and all kinds of plot twists reminiscent of a Dashiell Hammett novel.Johnson focuses on tiny details captured in close-up shots, like a burning cigarette or lingering shots of people's shoes or, most memorably, Emily's dead hand resting in shallow water. Many of these visual cues are nods to the cinema of David Lynch, complete with a shot of a ceiling fan that evokes the surreal filmmaker's short-lived T.V. show Twin Peaks. While characters tend to speak in the same cryptic fashion of a Lynch film, the snappy dialogue that flies fast and furious between characters is more akin to the way people speak in Howard Hawks films.Much like the Coen brothers film Miller's Crossing, Brick adopts stylized noir slang but in this case, contrasts it with a contemporary look that works surprisingly well. Like Gabriel Byrne's character in Miller's Crossing, Brendan is a smart guy who is often shown thinking as he tries to stay two steps ahead of everyone else. He is someone who is able to figure out all the angles and play them to his advantage but in the process gets repeatedly beaten up (much like Byrne's character).Even though Brick references Lynch and the Coens, it still feels like an original work made by someone with a distinct vision. The cast is uniformly excellent and handles Johnson's stylized prose perfectly. It's a dense text that has to be delivered in a specific way for the movie to work the way it does. To his credit, Johnson makes some fascinating choices in how he frames scenes and uses unusual close-ups with a minimalist score that is atmospheric but not obvious about it. It's a movie that constantly keeps us guessing, not knowing what to expect next but he displays enough confidence in his direction that we trust him to take us wherever he wants. Brick is an amazing debut film with an ingenuous premise and such a novel way of executing it that you find yourself immediately drawn into this world that Johnson has created.There are eight deleted and extended scenes each introduced by Johnson. There is more footage of Laura's party with the entire performance of ""The Sun Whose Rays are all Ablaze"" that she sings.""The Inside Track: Casting the Roles of Laura and Dode"" features audition footage of Nora Zehetner and Noah Segan reading for their roles. They are both excellent and it is obvious why they got the roles.Finally, there is an audio commentary by writer/director Rian Johnson, actors Noah Segan and Nora Zehetner, producer Ram Bergman, production designer Jodie Tillen and costume designer Michele Posch. Johnson talks about how he started off with no connections in the film industry and that it took six to seven years of shopping around his ""weird, little script"" to various production companies before he finally got the chance to make his movie. Instead of having everyone talk over each other, Johnson interviews each person about their experiences making the movie. This is solid commentary track filled with lots of good observations and fascinating information on how this movie was made.",5,David Lynch meets Dashiell Hammett in High School,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,3531,"['Rian', 'Johnson', 'debut', 'film', 'Brick', 'caused', 'something', 'minor', 'sensation', 'critics', 'discerning', 'cineastes', 'earlier', 'year', 'when', 'won', 'Special', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'Originality', 'Vision', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'was', 'nominated', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'Award', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'Award', 'best', 'film', 'production', 'budget', '500,000', 'Brick', 're-imagines', 'high', 'school', 'life', '1940s', 'film', 'noir', 'Johnson', 'film', 'terse', 'fast-talking', 'characters', 'kinds', 'plot', 'twists', 'reminiscent', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'novel.Johnson', 'tiny', 'details', 'captured', 'close-up', 'shots', 'burning', 'cigarette', 'lingering', 'shots', 'people', 'shoes', 'most', 'memorably', 'Emily', 'dead', 'hand', 'resting', 'shallow', 'water', 'Many', 'visual', 'cues', 'are', 'nods', 'cinema', 'David', 'Lynch', 'complete', 'shot', 'ceiling', 'fan', 'surreal', 'filmmaker', 'short-lived', 'T.V', 'show', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'characters', 'tend', 'speak', 'same', 'cryptic', 'fashion', 'Lynch', 'film', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'fast', 'furious', 'characters', 'more', 'akin', 'way', 'people', 'speak', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'films.Much', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'Brick', 'stylized', 'noir', 'slang', 'case', 'contemporary', 'look', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'character', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'Brendan', 'smart', 'guy', 'who', 'often', 'shown', 'thinking', 'stay', 'two', 'steps', 'ahead', 'everyone', 'else', 'someone', 'who', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'angles', 'play', 'advantage', 'process', 'repeatedly', 'beaten', 'up', 'much', 'Byrne', 'character', '.Even', 'Brick', 'references', 'Lynch', 'Coens', 'still', 'original', 'work', 'made', 'someone', 'distinct', 'vision', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Johnson', 'stylized', 'prose', 'perfectly', 'dense', 'text', 'be', 'delivered', 'specific', 'way', 'movie', 'work', 'way', 'credit', 'Johnson', 'fascinating', 'choices', 'how', 'scenes', 'unusual', 'close-ups', 'minimalist', 'score', 'atmospheric', 'not', 'obvious', 'movie', 'constantly', 'guessing', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'next', 'enough', 'confidence', 'direction', 'trust', 'take', 'Brick', 'amazing', 'debut', 'film', 'ingenuous', 'premise', 'novel', 'way', 'executing', 'find', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'world', 'Johnson', 'created.There', 'are', 'eight', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'introduced', 'Johnson', 'more', 'footage', 'Laura', 'party', 'entire', 'performance', 'Sun', 'Whose', 'Rays', 'are', 'Ablaze', 'Inside', 'Track', 'Casting', 'Roles', 'Laura', 'Dode', 'audition', 'footage', 'Nora', 'Zehetner', 'Noah', 'Segan', 'reading', 'roles', 'are', 'excellent', 'obvious', 'why', 'got', 'roles.Finally', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'actors', 'Noah', 'Segan', 'Nora', 'Zehetner', 'producer', 'Ram', 'Bergman', 'production', 'designer', 'Jodie', 'Tillen', 'costume', 'designer', 'Michele', 'Posch', 'Johnson', 'talks', 'how', 'started', 'off', 'connections', 'film', 'industry', 'took', 'six', 'seven', 'years', 'shopping', 'weird', 'little', 'script', 'various', 'production', 'companies', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'make', 'movie', 'Instead', 'having', 'everyone', 'talk', 'other', 'Johnson', 'person', 'experiences', 'making', 'movie', 'solid', 'commentary', 'track', 'filled', 'lots', 'good', 'observations', 'fascinating', 'information', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made']",N/A
173705,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,1417068329,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[4, 6]","'Brick' is smart.  It's a twist on the general crime noir, giving it an all too real feel by involving our deteriorating youth.  The majority of this film takes place on school grounds or in mom and pops basement, but it never feels amateur or immature.  This is mostly due to the cast of young actors who play their parts with sincerity and caution, not to appear too 'high-schoolish' while never crossing the line as to appear 'too old for the game' if you know what I mean.  These are the high school students of today.When Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) gets a message from his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emilie de Ravin) claiming to need help of some sort he finds himself delving deep into the underground ring of high-school crime, and when Emily shows up dead this leads Brendan to encounter and befriend (sort-of) all sorts of twisted teens, from the 26+ drug king known as The Pin (Lukas Haas) to his impatient strong arm Tug (Noah Fleiss) to the mysterious rich girl Laura (Nora Zehetner) who seems all to eager to help Brendan in his journey to uncover Emily's killer.Joseph plays Brendan, the loner student who always hangs on the outskirts of trouble, with enough subtlety and lax to make him believable.  You know he wants to help but you get the feeling it's not just because he feels he has too; I think he just knows that he can.  I've been a fan of Joseph's for a while now, favoring his brilliant work in Mysterious Skin over unworthy Oscar nominee Terrance Howard last year, and with 'Brick' Levitt continues to prove his weight in gold.  Meagan Good also turns out a convincing conniving manipulative tramp in the form of Drama Queen Kara, and Mike O'Leary does a great job as Brendan's confidant and friend The Brain.The script is also a major plus, creating an almost poetic lingo for today's teens, giving the film an interesting perspective and leading to some very interesting conversations.

Being a fan of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, among others, I'll admit I came to see how well writer/director Rian Johnson worked the gimmick of having contemporary high-schoolers speak in hard-boiled pulp-fiction slang -- but I stayed because I was riveted by the sinister mystery plot and touched by the heartache under hero Brendan's tough-loner demeanor. Think of it as RIVER'S EDGE written by Hammett. Teenagers tend to have their own language and their own ""outsiders vs. insiders"" way of looking at the world anyway. As a result, BRICK's hard-boiled lingo and dangerous doings turn out to be a good fit in a California high school setting, especially one as low on sunshine as the San Clemente locations used here.The actors play it straight, inhabiting their roles with emotions that ring true in or out of a crime movie. Everybody's excellent, though I was particularly impressed with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Brendan (he's transitioning from child roles to young adult roles nicely; I look forward to seeing what his acting future holds), Matt O'Leary as Brendan's friend/sidekick The Brain, Lukas Haas as drug-dealer The Pin (love the fact that he runs his criminal empire from his perky mom's suburban home), Emilie de Ravin as Brendan's doomed love Emily (the flashbacks to their relationship show that outsider Brendan isn't always the easiest guy to get along with, which made their relationship all the more poignant for me), Meagan Good as another of Brendan's old flames, selfish Theater Club queen Kara, and Nora Zehetner in what I think of as The Mary Astor Role. I was also lucky enough to receive a copy of a collectors'-edition glossary of the argot used in BRICK. Ironically, the one word it doesn't define is ""brick"" (""drugs"") itself. BRICK transcends its gimmick to be a tense yet touching thriller on its own terms; it's well worth a rental (good extras, too, including commentary by the director and cast, auditions, and deleted/extended scenes).",4,"Suspenseful, Poignant BRICK Transcends Its Gimmick",1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,2358,"['addition', 'such', 'celebrated', 'award-winning', 'nominated', 'films', 'THE', 'PIANIST', 'ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'THE', 'SPOTLESS', 'MIND', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'Focus', 'Features', 'released', 'number', 'gripping', 'crime/suspense', 'movies', 'including', 'THE', 'CONSTANT', 'GARDENER', 'THE', 'ICE', 'HARVEST', 'HOLLYWOODLAND', 'BRICK', 'recently', 'caught', 'up', 'DVD', 'never', 'played', 'theaters', 'Being', 'fan', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'others', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'came', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'writer/director', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'worked', 'gimmick', 'having', 'contemporary', 'high-schoolers', 'speak', 'hard-boiled', 'pulp-fiction', 'slang', 'stayed', 'was', 'riveted', 'sinister', 'mystery', 'plot', 'touched', 'heartache', 'hero', 'Brendan', 'tough-loner', 'demeanor', 'Think', 'RIVER', 'EDGE', 'written', 'Hammett', 'Teenagers', 'tend', 'have', 'own', 'language', 'own', 'outsiders', 'vs.', 'insiders', 'way', 'looking', 'world', 'anyway', 'result', 'BRICK', 'hard-boiled', 'lingo', 'dangerous', 'doings', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'fit', 'California', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'especially', 'one', 'low', 'sunshine', 'San', 'Clemente', 'locations', 'used', 'here.The', 'actors', 'play', 'straight', 'inhabiting', 'roles', 'emotions', 'ring', 'true', 'crime', 'movie', 'Everybody', 'excellent', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Brendan', 'transitioning', 'child', 'roles', 'young', 'adult', 'roles', 'nicely', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'acting', 'future', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'Brendan', 'friend/sidekick', 'Brain', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'drug-dealer', 'Pin', 'love', 'fact', 'criminal', 'empire', 'perky', 'mom', 'suburban', 'home', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'Brendan', 'doomed', 'love', 'Emily', 'flashbacks', 'relationship', 'show', 'outsider', 'Brendan', ""n't"", 'always', 'easiest', 'guy', 'get', 'made', 'relationship', 'more', 'poignant', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'Brendan', 'old', 'flames', 'selfish', 'Theater', 'Club', 'queen', 'Kara', 'Nora', 'Zehetner', 'what', 'think', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Role', 'was', 'also', 'lucky', 'enough', 'receive', 'copy', ""collectors'-edition"", 'glossary', 'argot', 'used', 'BRICK', 'Ironically', 'one', 'word', ""n't"", 'define', 'brick', 'drugs', 'BRICK', 'gimmick', 'be', 'tense', 'yet', 'touching', 'thriller', 'own', 'terms', 'well', 'rental', 'good', 'extras', 'too', 'including', 'commentary', 'director', 'cast', 'auditions', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes']",N/A
173714,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,1417068329,Dr. E,"[15, 37]","If you think ""Key Largo"" is just a place in Florida, if you think ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" seems a phrase in praise of tenacious package carriers, if you think ""Touch of Evil"" is a wrestling move in ""Nacho Libre"" . . . this film is for you. If you recognized these works as milestones in Film Noir, I strongly suggest you avoid this train wreck (you'll feel compelled to return to this page in an effort to ""school"" the plebs who know no better).Johnson's approach seems innovative to the casual film-viewer: replace mature actors with ""teenagers"" but maintain the overall spirit of the film. Genius! Unfortunately, worldly people realize this as a convention employed to seduce a younger, less discerning audience. Roger Kumble's ""Cruel Intentions"" is a similar modification of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos' ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses."" The only difference is that Kumble (also a relatively young director at the time) created a fairly complex work. The lives of these young people were genuinely engaging (no matter the viewer's age). What sparks even further concern are the aforementioned ""teenagers"" in this work. I find it revealing that Johnson would create a work with an adolescent target-demographic, but did not cast teenagers in these roles: Levitt and Zehetner were twenty-five years old during shooting (and, they look their age, which impacts ""suspension of disbelief."") Maybe Johnson should have consulted Gus Van Sant who has confidence in teenage actors: he uses them for both authenticity and to connect with his younger viewers. Still it took Johnson six years to find anyone to fund this product, so his insecurity is somewhat understandable.What you can expect from the film itself: 1.) While it attempts to emulate the stylized language of the genre, the result is both awkward and embarrassing. The staccato delivery is not as much compelling as it is painfully forced and grotesque. At times it seems as though the actors do not understand their lines, and thus a robotic (not detached, but robotic) effect is evoked. 2.)The cinematography is amateurish. Given that this is Rian Johnson's freshman-project (i.e. his first feature-length film) errors are to be expected but, his simultaneously self-indulgent and sloppy vision is virtually unforgivable. It reads as a graded exercise ... and I'd give Johnson an ""A,"" if he were an underclassman in an introductory class. 3.) The plot is shamefully obvious (a little innovation for this homage would have been welcome). If Johnson tackled even one of these elements with grace, I would have happily granted this film leeway (I mean, he did edit it on a home computer: again, no one wanted to fund this project). But that all three are a pitiful disaster is impossible to overlook.If you are searching for legitimate, contemporary Film Noir, consider: the Coens' ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" Kasdan's ""Body Heat,"" or Black's ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang."" Leave this vulgar aberration to its inevitable demise in Wal-Mart's clearance bin. Nonetheless, let me defer to the critics . . .I think the Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert (who found many redeeming qualities in the work) was sage in stating: ""The movie has one inevitable point of vulnerability: Because we can't believe in the characters, we can't care about their fates."" (This is common to many films within the genre though). Nonetheless, the equally as respected Richard Roeper (also Chicago Sun-Times) says it best: ""the gimmick wears thin.""",1,"What Does ""The Big Sleep"" Mean to You?",1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,3470,"['think', 'Key', 'Largo', 'just', 'place', 'Florida', 'think', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'phrase', 'praise', 'tenacious', 'package', 'carriers', 'think', 'Touch', 'Evil', 'wrestling', 'move', 'Nacho', 'Libre', 'film', 'recognized', 'works', 'milestones', 'Film', 'Noir', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'avoid', 'train', 'wreck', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'compelled', 'return', 'page', 'effort', 'school', 'plebs', 'who', 'know', 'better', '.Johnson', 'approach', 'innovative', 'casual', 'film-viewer', 'replace', 'mature', 'actors', 'teenagers', 'maintain', 'overall', 'spirit', 'film', 'Genius', 'Unfortunately', 'worldly', 'people', 'realize', 'convention', 'employed', 'seduce', 'younger', 'less', 'discerning', 'audience', 'Roger', 'Kumble', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'similar', 'modification', 'Pierre', 'Choderlos', 'Laclos', 'Les', 'Liaisons', 'Dangereuses', 'only', 'difference', 'Kumble', 'also', 'relatively', 'young', 'director', 'time', 'created', 'fairly', 'complex', 'work', 'lives', 'young', 'people', 'were', 'genuinely', 'engaging', 'matter', 'viewer', 'age', 'What', 'even', 'further', 'concern', 'are', 'aforementioned', 'teenagers', 'work', 'find', 'revealing', 'Johnson', 'would', 'create', 'work', 'adolescent', 'target-demographic', 'did', 'not', 'cast', 'teenagers', 'roles', 'Levitt', 'Zehetner', 'were', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'old', 'shooting', 'look', 'age', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Maybe', 'Johnson', 'should', 'have', 'consulted', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'who', 'confidence', 'teenage', 'actors', 'authenticity', 'connect', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Still', 'took', 'Johnson', 'six', 'years', 'find', 'anyone', 'fund', 'product', 'insecurity', 'somewhat', 'can', 'expect', 'film', '1', 'emulate', 'stylized', 'language', 'genre', 'result', 'awkward', 'embarrassing', 'staccato', 'delivery', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'compelling', 'painfully', 'forced', 'grotesque', 'times', 'actors', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'lines', 'thus', 'robotic', 'not', 'detached', 'robotic', 'effect', 'evoked', '2', 'cinematography', 'amateurish', 'Given', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'freshman-project', 'i.e', 'first', 'feature-length', 'film', 'errors', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'simultaneously', 'self-indulgent', 'sloppy', 'vision', 'virtually', 'unforgivable', 'graded', 'exercise', ""'d"", 'give', 'Johnson', 'A', 'were', 'underclassman', 'introductory', 'class', '3', 'plot', 'shamefully', 'obvious', 'little', 'innovation', 'homage', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'Johnson', 'tackled', 'even', 'one', 'elements', 'grace', 'would', 'have', 'happily', 'granted', 'film', 'leeway', 'mean', 'did', 'edit', 'home', 'computer', 'again', 'one', 'wanted', 'fund', 'project', 'three', 'are', 'pitiful', 'disaster', 'impossible', 'overlook.If', 'are', 'searching', 'legitimate', 'contemporary', 'Film', 'Noir', 'consider', 'Coens', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Kasdan', 'Body', 'Heat', 'Black', 'Kiss', 'Kiss', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'Leave', 'vulgar', 'aberration', 'inevitable', 'demise', 'Wal-Mart', 'clearance', 'bin', 'Nonetheless', 'let', 'defer', 'critics', '.I', 'think', 'Chicago', 'Sun-Times', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'who', 'found', 'many', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'work', 'was', 'sage', 'stating', 'movie', 'one', 'inevitable', 'point', 'vulnerability', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'care', 'fates', 'common', 'many', 'films', 'genre', 'Nonetheless', 'equally', 'respected', 'Richard', 'Roeper', 'also', 'Chicago', 'Sun-Times', 'best', 'gimmick', 'thin']",N/A

The rhythm of Johnson's dialogue is peppered with an often inscrutable combination of presumably current teen slang and period noirish-type barbs. The result can sound like hipster's gibberish, and this is where the DVD's English for the Hard of Hearing subtitle feature becomes useful in catching everything being said and getting a chance to understand what the characters are exactly saying.The movie's timeline jumps back and forth from the moment Brendan discovers Emily's dead body at the entrance of a concrete waterway tunnel. His murky investigation has him dealing with a gallery of fellow teens who play out their high-school stereotypes. There's nerdy Brain, a social outcast devoted to Brendan; drama queen Kara, who easily manipulates guys to meet her needs; spaced-out punker Dode, with whom Emily becomes attached after Brendan; a thuggish bully named Tugger; and even a doe-eyed femme fatale named Laura, who may or may not be on Brendan's aide.The most interesting character is the Pin, a dead-eyed drug dealer with an Everett Sloane-type limp. A long way from his little Amish boy in ""Witness"", Lukas Haas plays the Pin with a curiously unnerving ambiguity. By now settled with his indie cred thanks to ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""Latter Days"", Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Brendan with a closed-off world-weariness suitable for his adolescent Bogie-style character. Meagan Good also makes quite an impression as Kara whether looking like a Cabaret-style Liza or sporting full kabuki makeup. In fact, I wish she switched roles with Nora Zehetner, who plays the pivotal role of Laura with an unfortunately whispery uncertainty. However, it's fun to see 1970's blaxploitation icon Richard Roundtree (""Shaft"") play the put-upon vice principal with such unforced authority.Instead of going for the obvious black-and-white look of classic noir, Johnson has Steve Yedlin's clean, off-kilter cinematography, a major plus in adding to the moody atmosphere. The plot twists can be clever but without true emotional resonance, and the various elements have not been connected in the most dramatically effective manner. The result is a film that becomes as frustrating as it is creative. The DVD contains a feature-length commentary track from an especially lively Johnson and various crew and cast members, eight deleted and extended scenes interspersed with production stills and Johnson's introductions, and dispensable audition tapes for Zehetner and Noah Segan, who plays Dode.",3,Teenaged Film Noir and Angst Blend Precociously But Not Always Effectively,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2890,"['quite', 'precocious', 'move', 'use', ""1940's-style"", 'film', 'noir', 'narrative', 'techniques', 'place', 'contemporary', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'first-time', 'writer/director', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'apparently', 'inspired', 'works', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'intriguing', 'overly', 'convoluted', 'job', 'here', 'labyrinth', 'plot', 'Brendan', 'teenager', 'searching', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Emily', 'only', 'find', 'murdered', 'rhythm', 'Johnson', 'dialogue', 'peppered', 'often', 'inscrutable', 'combination', 'presumably', 'current', 'teen', 'slang', 'period', 'noirish-type', 'barbs', 'result', 'can', 'sound', 'hipster', 'gibberish', 'where', 'DVD', 'English', 'Hard', 'Hearing', 'subtitle', 'feature', 'useful', 'catching', 'everything', 'being', 'said', 'getting', 'chance', 'understand', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'exactly', 'saying.The', 'movie', 'timeline', 'back', 'forth', 'moment', 'Brendan', 'Emily', 'dead', 'body', 'entrance', 'concrete', 'waterway', 'tunnel', 'murky', 'investigation', 'dealing', 'gallery', 'fellow', 'teens', 'who', 'play', 'out', 'high-school', 'stereotypes', 'nerdy', 'Brain', 'social', 'outcast', 'devoted', 'Brendan', 'drama', 'queen', 'Kara', 'who', 'easily', 'guys', 'meet', 'needs', 'spaced-out', 'punker', 'Dode', 'whom', 'Emily', 'attached', 'Brendan', 'thuggish', 'bully', 'named', 'Tugger', 'even', 'doe-eyed', 'femme', 'fatale', 'named', 'Laura', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Brendan', 'aide.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Pin', 'dead-eyed', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Everett', 'Sloane-type', 'limp', 'long', 'way', 'little', 'Amish', 'boy', 'Witness', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'Pin', 'curiously', 'unnerving', 'ambiguity', 'now', 'settled', 'indie', 'cred', 'thanks', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'Latter', 'Days', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Brendan', 'closed-off', 'world-weariness', 'suitable', 'adolescent', 'Bogie-style', 'character', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'also', 'quite', 'impression', 'Kara', 'looking', 'Cabaret-style', 'Liza', 'sporting', 'full', 'kabuki', 'makeup', 'fact', 'wish', 'switched', 'roles', 'Nora', 'Zehetner', 'who', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Laura', 'unfortunately', 'whispery', 'uncertainty', 'However', 'fun', 'see', '1970', 'blaxploitation', 'icon', 'Richard', 'Roundtree', 'Shaft', 'play', 'put-upon', 'vice', 'principal', 'such', 'unforced', 'authority.Instead', 'going', 'obvious', 'black-and-white', 'look', 'classic', 'noir', 'Johnson', 'Steve', 'Yedlin', 'clean', 'off-kilter', 'cinematography', 'major', 'plus', 'adding', 'moody', 'atmosphere', 'plot', 'twists', 'can', 'be', 'clever', 'true', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'various', 'elements', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'connected', 'most', 'dramatically', 'effective', 'manner', 'result', 'film', 'as', 'frustrating', 'creative', 'DVD', 'feature-length', 'commentary', 'track', 'especially', 'lively', 'Johnson', 'various', 'crew', 'cast', 'members', 'eight', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'interspersed', 'production', 'stills', 'Johnson', 'introductions', 'dispensable', 'audition', 'tapes', 'Zehetner', 'Noah', 'Segan', 'who', 'Dode']",N/A

Instead, they all use this kind of slang that tries to sound poetic, but ends up sounding like gibberish instead.  I've included two examples to show what I mean (both examples involve the main character Brendan, played by  Joseph Gordon-Levitt):Example # 1DODE -- Heel it now, dig?BRENDAN -- Throw one at me if you want, hash-head.  I got all five senses and I slept last night.  That puts me six-up on the lot of you.""Example # 2BRENDAN -- I need you to op.  Like on Jerr, but that was cake to this, and unlike Jerr, there's not much chance of coming out clean.  24/7 on this one.  You okay to op for me again?BRAIN -- So what first, tip the bulls?BRENDAN -- No.  Bulls would gum it.  They'd flash their dusty standards at the wide-eyes, probably find some yegg to pin, probably even the right one.  But they'd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes.""And on and on like this.  If by reading these examples, you get a feel for how awkward the dialogue is, imagine hearing this dialogue from actors who don't seem to understand the dialogue either.  What you end up with is actors reciting their lines with either too much emotion or too little (and mostly too little).I don't mind writers playing with language and using double-meanings. However, to be effective, these plays on language need to be used sparingly.In this movie, however, they're overused (all the characters except the adults talk this way).Also, although there's bending of language in this film, it didn't feel playful to me.  Instead, it felt elitist...like someone using jargon to appear smarter than everyone else.Not only did the jargon feel like trying  too hard to impress, but so, too,  did using  overly stylized camera shots and lighting. Out of nowhere, you'll get really close-up camera shots and scenes that are all dark with only the face lit.There's nothing wrong with playing with camera shots and lighting, but in this movie, those tricks come at you in an abrupt way....and I don't mean abrupt  in a delightfully clever way, but abrupt in an awkward, sticking-out-like-a-sore-thumb way.Because this movie had more flash than substance , I couldn't connect with the story or the characters.

173726,A742NFYPDU2P,1417068329,Evan E. Richards,"[6, 8]","This is a classic film noir with a twist. It has all of the elements of a film noir. You have you murder in a big city, and the follow-up investigation by the ""private eye"" (in this case a concerned amateur). You have the private eye's best friend who can somehow get information on anything and anyone. You have the drug kingpin (referred to only as ""The Pin"") and his hired muscle. You have your cheating female in distress and your femme fatal. The story is about doomed characters trapped in situations they are not responsible for. And here is the twist: all the characters are in high school.As a recently graduated filmmaker, I have seen a lot of student films. The problem I have with most student films is that they want to have this epic story of drug dealers, mafiosos, hit men, etc. But all the parts are played by college students and you think...this is just a bunch of college students pretending to be drug dealers, mafiosos, hit men, etc. It would seem that a film noir composed entirely of high school students would never work. But it does.I think the reason this film works is that it takes itself so seriously. Everything about it screams film noir. The characters talk like they are in a film noir. They say things like ""I've got knives in my eyes, I'm going home sick."" and ""I've got all five senses and I slept last night, that puts me six up on the lot of you."" You never hear people talk like that in real life. When you first see ""the pin"" he has a black cane and a cape. Seriously? Have you ever seen a high school student wearing a cape? But that's precisely why it works. It creates a whole new world that you have never seen and it doesn't back down for a second in presenting this world to you in all its gritty detail.This film works and yet it knows that you are suspending a lot of disbelief and throws in a couple scenes to let you know that it is ok to laugh if you want to. There is a great scene where the ""private eye"" and ""the pin"" meet at the dining room table of the pin's house and his mother serves them lemonade.The actors are all top notch. The camera work is great. The plot is twisty and unpredictable. Overall this was a very engaging and fun cinematic experience.Side note: If you are a fan of Film Noir see if you can pick up two direct references to ""The Maltese Falcon""",4,Film noir with a twist,1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,2323,"['classic', 'film', 'noir', 'twist', 'elements', 'film', 'noir', 'have', 'murder', 'big', 'city', 'follow-up', 'investigation', 'private', 'eye', 'case', 'concerned', 'amateur', 'have', 'private', 'eye', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'can', 'somehow', 'get', 'information', 'anything', 'anyone', 'have', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'referred', 'only', 'Pin', 'hired', 'muscle', 'have', 'cheating', 'female', 'distress', 'femme', 'fatal', 'story', 'doomed', 'characters', 'trapped', 'situations', 'are', 'not', 'responsible', 'here', 'twist', 'characters', 'are', 'high', 'school.As', 'recently', 'graduated', 'filmmaker', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'student', 'films', 'problem', 'have', 'most', 'student', 'films', 'want', 'have', 'epic', 'story', 'drug', 'dealers', 'mafiosos', 'hit', 'men', 'etc', 'parts', 'are', 'played', 'college', 'students', 'think', 'just', 'bunch', 'college', 'students', 'pretending', 'be', 'drug', 'dealers', 'mafiosos', 'hit', 'men', 'etc', 'would', 'seem', 'film', 'noir', 'composed', 'entirely', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'would', 'never', 'work', 'think', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'seriously', 'Everything', 'film', 'noir', 'characters', 'talk', 'are', 'film', 'noir', 'say', 'things', ""'ve"", 'got', 'knives', 'eyes', ""'m"", 'going', 'home', 'sick', ""'ve"", 'got', 'five', 'senses', 'slept', 'last', 'night', 'six', 'up', 'lot', 'never', 'hear', 'people', 'talk', 'real', 'life', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'pin', 'black', 'cane', 'cape', 'Seriously', 'Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'wearing', 'cape', 'precisely', 'why', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'have', 'never', 'seen', ""n't"", 'back', 'down', 'second', 'presenting', 'world', 'gritty', 'detail.This', 'film', 'works', 'yet', 'are', 'suspending', 'lot', 'disbelief', 'couple', 'scenes', 'let', 'know', 'ok', 'laugh', 'want', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'private', 'eye', 'pin', 'meet', 'dining', 'room', 'table', 'pin', 'house', 'mother', 'lemonade.The', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'camera', 'work', 'great', 'plot', 'twisty', 'unpredictable', 'was', 'very', 'engaging', 'fun', 'cinematic', 'experience.Side', 'note', 'are', 'fan', 'Film', 'Noir', 'see', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'two', 'direct', 'references', 'Maltese', 'Falcon']",N/A

Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) begins his quest to discover the whys of his ex-girlfriend's death.  The film begins with him receiving a mysterious call from Emily, her stating that she is ""in trouble."" Snooping around, and enlisting his friend Brain for clues, Brendan encounters some shady types around the high school as he gets closer to the darker truth of her end, and becomes involved in a dangerous drug world.While I loved the attempt to make this a modern day noir, somehow it just didn't work that well. For one, although the rhythm of the dialogue is quick, face-paced, and snappy, it seems like the characters are just saying lines rather than really acting. They keep the mood of a hard-broiled noir intact, but the dialogue is devoid of any real meaning. Secondly, half the time you can't understand what the characters are saying. Even with subtitles, the lingo is just way too over the top and distracting (one reviewer said it best, sort of ""hipster noir""....i.e. ""I've got knives in my eyes."" translation: ""I have a bad headache."")Even as homage to noir, the dialogue goes around in circles without really making any sense or having much power. Finally, it takes way too long for this story to get going, and the 110 minutes for the amount of ""real story"" is way too long. It was painstaking to wait for key plot events to surface, and mysteries to be unraveled. When it finally does get going with Brendan encountering various thugs and bad dudes , the story does get more interesting, but it need not take that long to get there.I really liked the effort that Brick makes to be a fresh take on the noir film, but over all, it was just so-so.",3,"Unique concept, so-so execution",1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,1817,"['Brick', 'stylish', 'modern', 'day', 'noir', 'uniquely', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'main', 'stars', 'students', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'going', 'class', 'much', 'Brendan', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'quest', 'discover', 'whys', 'ex-girlfriend', 'death', 'film', 'receiving', 'mysterious', 'call', 'Emily', 'stating', 'trouble', 'Snooping', 'around', 'enlisting', 'friend', 'Brain', 'clues', 'Brendan', 'shady', 'types', 'high', 'school', 'closer', 'darker', 'truth', 'end', 'involved', 'dangerous', 'drug', 'world.While', 'loved', 'attempt', 'make', 'modern', 'day', 'noir', 'somehow', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'one', 'rhythm', 'dialogue', 'quick', 'face-paced', 'snappy', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'saying', 'lines', 'rather', 'really', 'acting', 'keep', 'mood', 'hard-broiled', 'noir', 'intact', 'dialogue', 'devoid', 'real', 'meaning', 'Secondly', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'saying', 'Even', 'subtitles', 'lingo', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'distracting', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'best', 'sort', 'hipster', 'noir', '.i.e', ""'ve"", 'got', 'knives', 'eyes', 'translation', 'have', 'bad', 'headache', 'Even', 'homage', 'noir', 'dialogue', 'around', 'circles', 'really', 'making', 'sense', 'having', 'much', 'power', 'Finally', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'story', 'get', 'going', '110', 'minutes', 'amount', 'real', 'story', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'painstaking', 'wait', 'key', 'plot', 'events', 'surface', 'mysteries', 'be', 'unraveled', 'When', 'finally', 'get', 'going', 'Brendan', 'encountering', 'various', 'thugs', 'bad', 'dudes', 'story', 'get', 'more', 'interesting', 'need', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'get', 'there.I', 'really', 'liked', 'effort', 'Brick', 'be', 'fresh', 'take', 'noir', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'so-so']",N/A
173728,A3T6HX48F66512,1417068329,Fry Boy,"[1, 1]","""Brick"" is a daring piece of crime cinema that revolves around a certain subculture at a high school.  There are only two adult characters in the movie: the vice principal and someone's mother. The lack of adults in the movie, however, lends a gravity to the film and its characters.  At no time is anyone seen in class.  Everything, for the most part, takes place outside the school proper: in the parking lot; on the football field; in a dressing room; near a remote outbuilding (where the main character, Bredan [a loner], has his lunch [and where someone has his or her lunch is a point of distinction brought out several times).  Beyond the school grounds, much of the story transpires in and around a few houses.  The absence of adults, however, lends credulity to the story and let's the audience experience what serious business all these high schoolers are up to.The movie begins with Brendan's discovery of his ex-girlfriend Emilie lying dead in a drainage ditch, after which there is a flashback two days into the past, when he receives a panicked call from her asking him for help.  What transpires from that point on is a story of drugs, murder, deception, discovery and revenge.  All in all, I enjoyed the movie.  In homage to old film noir and gumshoe movies, the characters speak with the vernaculars of Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart and Edmond O'Brien, using words like ""sap,"" ""clam"" and other such throwbacks.  In fact, the dialogue is reminiscent of a Shakespeare play, where you don't quite get into the lingo groove for a third of the performance, after which everything that's said because much more clear.  This, unfortunately, is sometimes undermined by frequently mumbled lines from the actors, who all do a fabulous job notwithstanding.While it might be hard to apply ""accept the premise, accept the bit"" to this film, its far-fetched setting, goings-on and cast of characters were nevertheless a joy to experience.

It's a very strange and weird idea: Shoot a film noir and do the dialogue and structure as if you were adapting a Hammett novel back in the day, but set and shoot the movie at a contemporary California high school.  Either you think this is brilliant or you think it's totally idiotic.From my own experience and from talking to others, I think it is tough to get into this movie primarily because of the patterns of speech. Everybody talks very fast with a stylized delivery as if they were in a movie from the 30s or 40s, using a lot of slang most of us don't use, and the sound quality isn't so great. My suggestion to anyone who wants to give this a go but winds up having a hard time is to try it out with SUBTITLES, believe it or not (and I am *not* kidding about this). Because once I did, I realized I was mishearing certain words and I started to pick up on the rhythms, hear things correctly, and the dialogue started to sound natural; eventually I got into the flow of it enough to get rid of them (though I admit in a few scenes I wound up going back and putting them back on just to make sure I got the lines right).You might ask, what's the point of doing a movie this way if it winds up creating a problem like that?  Well, I think that the reason for dealing with this is because this oddball strategy of Rian Johnson's winds up actually creating one of the more successful attempts at a contemporary film noir. For whatever strange reason, the artificiality of the dialogue and farcical nature of the proceedings works quite well once you give in to the conceit. Many other attempts at doing a modern neo-noir wind up feeling way too ""retro"" and nostalgic and they stumble over themselves trying to figure out how to be modern but yet try to keep all the elements of old detective thrillers that people miss and want to see (see Kiss Kiss Bang Bang for an example of sort of the tricky questions that come up in trying to do contemporary noir). The high school setting actually defuses that problem because it is silly and anachronistic already, so having modern day kids talking in old fashioned out of date tough guy lingo is no more strange than having anyone else, adult or not, talking that way these days. The plot is predictably convoluted in the old noir-detective style and there are all the usual archetypes and manipulations. Somehow they seem sort of fresh in the setting of high school. And since most of us tended to discover detective novels in our teen years, it seems perfectly fitting to project their tropes out into that world, to imagine that high school is a microcosm of all the things one read about in pulp fiction.So I'll take sides with the ""pro""-Brick crowd; I enjoyed it.",4,a viewing suggestion,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,2790,"['can', 'understand', 'why', 'reviews', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'split', 'down', 'middle', 'very', 'strange', 'weird', 'idea', 'Shoot', 'film', 'noir', 'do', 'dialogue', 'structure', 'were', 'adapting', 'Hammett', 'novel', 'back', 'day', 'set', 'shoot', 'movie', 'contemporary', 'California', 'high', 'school', 'think', 'brilliant', 'think', 'totally', 'idiotic.From', 'own', 'experience', 'talking', 'others', 'think', 'tough', 'get', 'movie', 'primarily', 'patterns', 'speech', 'Everybody', 'very', 'fast', 'stylized', 'delivery', 'were', 'movie', '30s', '40s', 'using', 'lot', 'slang', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'sound', 'quality', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'suggestion', 'anyone', 'who', 'give', 'go', 'up', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'try', 'out', 'SUBTITLES', 'believe', 'not', 'am', '*not*', 'kidding', 'once', 'did', 'realized', 'was', 'mishearing', 'certain', 'words', 'started', 'pick', 'up', 'rhythms', 'hear', 'things', 'correctly', 'dialogue', 'started', 'sound', 'natural', 'eventually', 'got', 'flow', 'get', 'rid', 'admit', 'few', 'scenes', 'wound', 'up', 'going', 'back', 'putting', 'back', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'got', 'lines', 'right', '.You', 'might', 'ask', 'what', 'point', 'doing', 'movie', 'way', 'up', 'creating', 'problem', 'Well', 'think', 'reason', 'dealing', 'oddball', 'strategy', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'up', 'actually', 'creating', 'one', 'more', 'successful', 'attempts', 'contemporary', 'film', 'noir', 'strange', 'reason', 'artificiality', 'dialogue', 'farcical', 'nature', 'proceedings', 'quite', 'well', 'once', 'give', 'conceit', 'Many', 'other', 'attempts', 'doing', 'modern', 'neo-noir', 'wind', 'up', 'feeling', 'way', 'too', 'retro', 'nostalgic', 'stumble', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'be', 'modern', 'yet', 'try', 'keep', 'elements', 'old', 'detective', 'thrillers', 'people', 'miss', 'want', 'see', 'see', 'Kiss', 'Kiss', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'example', 'sort', 'tricky', 'questions', 'come', 'up', 'trying', 'do', 'contemporary', 'noir', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'actually', 'problem', 'silly', 'anachronistic', 'already', 'so', 'having', 'modern', 'day', 'kids', 'talking', 'old', 'fashioned', 'date', 'tough', 'guy', 'lingo', 'more', 'strange', 'having', 'anyone', 'else', 'adult', 'not', 'talking', 'way', 'days', 'plot', 'predictably', 'convoluted', 'old', 'noir-detective', 'style', 'are', 'usual', 'archetypes', 'manipulations', 'Somehow', 'seem', 'sort', 'fresh', 'setting', 'high', 'school', 'most', 'tended', 'discover', 'detective', 'novels', 'teen', 'years', 'perfectly', 'fitting', 'project', 'tropes', 'out', 'world', 'imagine', 'high', 'school', 'microcosm', 'things', 'one', 'read', 'pulp', 'fiction.So', ""'ll"", 'take', 'sides', 'pro', '-Brick', 'crowd', 'enjoyed']",N/A

The plot itself is a bit of Hammett's ""Red Harvest"" (possibly his greatest work) and Chandler's ""The Big Sleep"". It's tense, a little convoluted, but breathtaking to behold.

173735,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,1417068329,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[6, 21]","Brick is a very ambitious attempt at hybrid yet derivitive indy type film making.  Such attempts can yield incredible results as in Slingblade, Pulp Fiction or Blair Witch Project.  Other times the result is a miserable mess.  Unfortunately, Brick is a steaming pile that is more akin to the latter than the former.Set in the modern day, Brick is essentially a 40's style noir tale juxtaposed to a cast of Southern California highschool street rats.  After having seen the film, my recurring thought was ""Why?""  I suppose I can see how someone might think this story concept could work.  It's a fairly original concept.  I'll give it that.  I'll even allow that the right treatment of Brick very well could have worked to some degree.  Unfortunately, it definitely does not work here.The major characteristics and archetypes of the noir genre are represented in Brick.  As in many noir films the dialogue is highly stylized and germane only to the universe in which the story takes place.  There is a machine gun cadence to the dialogue delivery that, at times is unintentionally funny.  Unintentional humor is not something filmmakers should shoot for.  It's a good thing people in the real world don't talk the way noir characters do.  If they did no one would understand a thing anyone else was saying.  I appreciate this aspect of the noir genre and have enjoyed it when done well in classic noir films.  But in Brick, it's just too hard to believe that modern day Southern California teens could ever be capable of such dialogue.  It is also hard to swallow the notion that these kids could have lived long enough to become as jaded as is necessary to be authentic noir characters.  As such the entire foundation on which the film rests rings completely false.  These failures totally undermine Brick's character plausibility and represent a fundamental and fatal flaw.  Clearly, the film sounds like a duck, but we know all along that it's not a duck.The hero of the tale is of course a romantically tortured tough guy loner.  His adversary (aside from the entire world) is a highly intelligent yet amoral and calculating crime boss with a gaggle of lesser minded goons in tow.  There is the obligatory murder victim around which conflict must revolve.  There is a brainy touchstone and ally of the hero who seemingly exists for no other purpose than to do the heroe's grunt work and flesh out details to advance the mostly uninspired plot.  There's even a Macguffin thrown in for good measure, which in this film's case is of course a brick (of heroin).  I am confident when I say that my divulging of these details does not in anyway constitute a spoiler.The noir genre by definition is hinged upon extreme melodrama, quirky and intense dialogue and extreme machismo.  When depicted with a backdrop of plausible characters the formula can work very well.  But when channeled through modern day teens whom we know are much more likely to be downloading P-Diddy tunes on their MP3 players than playing gumshoes to murder, the whole affair simply collapses under it's own weight.  The director and writer aimed high and should be commended for that.  They just missed this time.",2,Fundamental and fatal flaws kill this one...,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,3183,"['Brick', 'very', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'hybrid', 'yet', 'derivitive', 'indy', 'type', 'film', 'making', 'Such', 'attempts', 'can', 'yield', 'incredible', 'results', 'Slingblade', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Other', 'times', 'result', 'miserable', 'mess', 'Unfortunately', 'Brick', 'steaming', 'pile', 'more', 'akin', 'latter', 'former.Set', 'modern', 'day', 'Brick', 'essentially', '40', 'style', 'noir', 'tale', 'juxtaposed', 'cast', 'Southern', 'California', 'highschool', 'street', 'rats', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'recurring', 'thought', 'was', 'Why', 'suppose', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'might', 'think', 'story', 'concept', 'could', 'work', 'fairly', 'original', 'concept', ""'ll"", 'give', ""'ll"", 'even', 'allow', 'right', 'treatment', 'Brick', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'degree', 'Unfortunately', 'definitely', 'not', 'work', 'here.The', 'major', 'characteristics', 'archetypes', 'noir', 'genre', 'are', 'represented', 'Brick', 'many', 'noir', 'films', 'dialogue', 'highly', 'stylized', 'only', 'universe', 'story', 'place', 'machine', 'gun', 'cadence', 'dialogue', 'delivery', 'times', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'Unintentional', 'humor', 'not', 'something', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'shoot', 'good', 'thing', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'way', 'noir', 'characters', 'do', 'did', 'one', 'would', 'understand', 'thing', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'saying', 'appreciate', 'aspect', 'noir', 'genre', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'done', 'well', 'classic', 'noir', 'films', 'Brick', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'believe', 'modern', 'day', 'Southern', 'California', 'teens', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'capable', 'such', 'dialogue', 'also', 'hard', 'swallow', 'notion', 'kids', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'long', 'enough', 'become', 'as', 'jaded', 'necessary', 'be', 'authentic', 'noir', 'characters', 'such', 'entire', 'foundation', 'film', 'rings', 'completely', 'false', 'failures', 'totally', 'undermine', 'Brick', 'character', 'plausibility', 'represent', 'fundamental', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'Clearly', 'film', 'duck', 'know', 'not', 'duck.The', 'hero', 'tale', 'course', 'romantically', 'tortured', 'tough', 'guy', 'loner', 'adversary', 'aside', 'entire', 'world', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'yet', 'amoral', 'calculating', 'crime', 'boss', 'gaggle', 'lesser', 'minded', 'goons', 'tow', 'obligatory', 'murder', 'victim', 'conflict', 'must', 'revolve', 'brainy', 'touchstone', 'ally', 'hero', 'who', 'seemingly', 'other', 'purpose', 'do', 'heroe', 'grunt', 'work', 'flesh', 'out', 'details', 'advance', 'mostly', 'uninspired', 'plot', 'even', 'Macguffin', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'film', 'case', 'course', 'brick', 'heroin', 'am', 'confident', 'when', 'say', 'divulging', 'details', 'not', 'anyway', 'constitute', 'spoiler.The', 'noir', 'genre', 'definition', 'hinged', 'extreme', 'melodrama', 'quirky', 'intense', 'dialogue', 'extreme', 'machismo', 'When', 'depicted', 'backdrop', 'plausible', 'characters', 'formula', 'can', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'channeled', 'modern', 'day', 'whom', 'know', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'downloading', 'P-Diddy', 'tunes', 'MP3', 'players', 'playing', 'gumshoes', 'murder', 'whole', 'affair', 'simply', 'own', 'weight', 'director', 'writer', 'aimed', 'high', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'just', 'missed', 'time']",N/A

173737,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,1417068329,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 6]","This movie was surprisingly good. It's not a movie I envision people running out to see in the theaters. It's the type of film that you'd catch on cable. The movie brings to life a genre which has all but disappeared from mainstream cinema, but also brings a refreshing feeling of originality through its use of unconventional characters.  Joseph G.Leavitt  was great in this film he has taken a lot of risks in the roles he plays -- from troubled teen in MANIC, to the gay hustler in MYSTERIOUS SKIN).The movie unfolds slowly, and it nearly makes you want to give up on it because the script employs verbiage in the vein of a 1940's James Cagney film. Snappy dialogue, delivered at a rapid fire pace and flowery turn of phrases that you have to pay attention to decipher. As a 1940's noir type film, it has the standard archetypes: the hero who is seeking justice, his brainy sidekick, the femme fatale, the gal with the heart of gold, the larger than life villain (played by Lukas Haas) and his dunderhead henchman.While very inventive, it could easily turn a person off, but as the movie progresses, you learn to appreciate the tone and the simple fact that the film doesn't talk down to you.Another thing I liked about the movie is that it's not trying to pull the wool over your eyes. At first, hearing these young-ish actors speaking this type of dialogue feels as if they're playing grown-up, it threatens to be campy, but by alluding to rides from parents and trips to the Vice-Principal's office, you realize that these are teens and they are not trying to be anything other than teens. My only gripe is the sound. Editing must've been tough and several times lines were garbled or mumbled, making it necessary to rewind and find out what was said. Despite it's flaws, this Brick doesn't sink.This film is daring, brutal and at times actually fun. If this was shoot in black and white then it would've been a cult classic authenticity.

It's like a classic Humphrey Bogart movie, except with high school kids. Needless to say, not everyone will like it. When we meet Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who proved he could really act in Manic) he's looking at the dead body of a girl. The story jumps back two days and we see this same girls hand slip a note inside a locker. The locker belongs to Brendan of course and the note gives him direction to go to a certain payphone and wait. When it rings, it's his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emilie De Ravin, 'The Hills Have Eyes')...Sounding distraught, she rambles on for a few minutes; Saying she's scared and asking for help, but then a car drives by causing her to hang up and flee. After doing some investigating, Brendan finally meets up with Emily who asks him to forget about it. The next day, she's dead. As Brendan searches for the culprit, with the help of his friend Brain (Matt O'Leary), he winds up in a surreal whirlwind of drugs, deceit, and murder. Overall, it sounds like pretty standard stuff...But it's a lot more elaborate than that. Making a ""whodunit"" movie nowadays is hard; It's been done so many times, that you can pretty much see every twist a mile away. That's not so with this film. The plot twists are piled on heavily and you don't know ""whodunit"" until the very end, but this movie doesn't rest its fate in the hands of whodunit. What happens as Brendan tries to figure out what's going on is actually really entertaining to. As I said, the dialogue is very Bogart-like;Coming from high-school kids (although Levitt's 26 and De Ravin is in her twenties I think) dialogue like this should seem campy and unrealistic, but it works. Even the stuff in this movie that seems overly campy (there's a character named The Pin, a big time drug runner who's got a hired muscle named Tug; Both of whom are a big part of the story) works perfectly in the way this film is made. This movie is very elaborate, so pay close attention to it. The cinematography and the gloomy mood the film has is great. If you're into interesting and elaborate films (this movies does remind me of The Machinist a little bit. Only because of the cinematography and the music; The story has no similarities) then definitely see this movie.GRADE: A-",5,Different,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,2410,"['Writer/Director', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'Brick', 'film-noir', 'detective', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'elabortate', 'surreal', 'filled', 'really', 'good-30s', 'dialogue', 'classic', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'Needless', 'say', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'When', 'meet', 'Brendan', 'Frye', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'proved', 'could', 'really', 'act', 'Manic', 'looking', 'dead', 'body', 'girl', 'story', 'back', 'two', 'days', 'see', 'same', 'girls', 'hand', 'slip', 'note', 'locker', 'locker', 'Brendan', 'course', 'note', 'direction', 'go', 'certain', 'payphone', 'wait', 'When', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Emily', 'Emilie', 'De', 'Ravin', ""'The"", 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Sounding', 'distraught', 'few', 'minutes', 'Saying', 'scared', 'asking', 'help', 'then', 'car', 'drives', 'causing', 'hang', 'up', 'flee', 'doing', 'investigating', 'Brendan', 'finally', 'up', 'Emily', 'who', 'forget', 'next', 'day', 'dead', 'Brendan', 'searches', 'culprit', 'help', 'friend', 'Brain', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'up', 'surreal', 'whirlwind', 'drugs', 'deceit', 'murder', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'standard', 'stuff', 'lot', 'more', 'elaborate', 'Making', 'whodunit', 'movie', 'nowadays', 'hard', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'see', 'twist', 'mile', 'away', 'not', 'so', 'film', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'piled', 'heavily', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'whodunit', 'very', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rest', 'fate', 'hands', 'whodunit', 'What', 'Brendan', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'actually', 'really', 'entertaining', 'said', 'dialogue', 'very', 'Bogart-like', 'Coming', 'high-school', 'kids', 'Levitt', '26', 'De', 'Ravin', 'twenties', 'think', 'dialogue', 'should', 'seem', 'campy', 'unrealistic', 'Even', 'stuff', 'movie', 'overly', 'campy', 'character', 'named', 'Pin', 'big', 'time', 'drug', 'runner', 'who', 'got', 'hired', 'muscle', 'named', 'Tug', 'whom', 'are', 'big', 'part', 'story', 'perfectly', 'way', 'film', 'made', 'movie', 'very', 'elaborate', 'so', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'cinematography', 'gloomy', 'mood', 'film', 'great', ""'re"", 'interesting', 'elaborate', 'films', 'movies', 'remind', 'Machinist', 'little', 'bit', 'Only', 'cinematography', 'music', 'story', 'similarities', 'then', 'definitely', 'see', 'movie.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

I mean there's been some really great Noir coming out in the last couple of years. Brick, which seems to be of the more classical style of Noir, but we've also had Sin City, and the upcoming Black Dahlia, along with Soderbergh's Good German.When I first saw previews for this film I was entranced, the camera shots, style, jargon, and characters were spot on. Even when I began to realize from trailers that this was a high school Noir I didn't harbor any reservations. I don't quite know how to describe the genuis of the film, but it takes a somewhat novel if not seemingly misguided idea and twists it into one of the greatest Noir detective stories I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.Not only that, but a seemingly incomprehensible story line is made so elementary that a grade schooler could follow it.

173748,AXTQNY0DV8R9I,1417068329,Kells,"[2, 2]","Brick is a fast paced film that bears watching repeatedly. (It can be viewed here on Amazon.com -- free with Amazon Prime.) The online transfer is good with a clear and intelligible soundtrack -- but the noir slang may not be familiar to most.I liked it enough that I bought the DVD. The extras are a mixed bag; the commentary track is a mess and other than telling us the film was totally filmed in San Clemente, California, it is just a curiosity. The deleted scenes are good, and the two ""screen tests"" are ok.The real value of the DVD is in the English subtitles. (Spanish & French subtitles are also included.)I've included the IMDb.com slang list for this film, because reading it on IMDb reveals plot:Blow - To leave, depart; e.g., ""Did she blow last night?""Brick - A term used to describe a pound or kilogram of any drug, in the case of this film its heroin.Bulls - Cops; e.g., ""What first, tip the bulls?"" Also, as a verb, to turn over to the cops; e.g., ""I bulled the rat.""Burg (or Burgh) - Town, City; e.g., ""He knows every two-bit toker in the burg.""C - Roman numeral for 100; e.g., ""He had a C-Note.""Clam - To keep your mouth shut e.g., ""The muscle blows or I'll clam.""Copped - Obtained; e.g., ""She copped the junk.""Dose - To take drugs e.g., ""He dosed off the bad junk and it laid him out.""Duck Soup - Easy pickings.Gat - Gun.Gum - To mess things up; e.g., ""Bulls would only gum it.""Heel - To walk away from (and show your heels to); e.g., ""I'm not heeling you to hook you.""Hook - Raise interest or get involved; e.g. ""I'm not heeling to hook you.""Hop/Jake/Junk - Drugs. Back when noir films were more popular, (1940's-50's); hop is often used to reference marijuana and ""hophead"" is someone who smokes a lot of pot.Knives in my eyes - a splitting headache; e.g., ""I've got knives in my eyes. I'm going home sick.""Lap Dog - A lap dog is defined as a dog that is small enough to be held in the arms or lay comfortably on a person's lap. The term is also sometimes used to describe a person who is very easily controlled, such as a yes man. In the case of Brick both definitions are cleverly combined. If you recall the scene where we first meet Kara, she has a freshman boys head in her lap, who springs to her command of ""run and get my purse.""On the Nail - immediately; e.g., ""He wants cash on the nail.""Pick - A ride in a car (as in ""pick-up""); e.g., ""Did she get a pick?""Raise - To get in touch with; e.g., ""You couldn't raise em?"" This is also used cleverly when Brain asks Brendan, ""You couldn't raise her?"" referring to Emily whom he could neither contact nor raise, as in raise from the dead.Reef Worm - A stoner (reefer).Scape - A patsy to take the blame (scapegoat/ fall guy).Scraped - Begged off of, cadged from; e.g., ""Ask any dope rat where their junk sprang and they'll say they scraped it off [name]...""Shamus - A private detective.Shine - To wield (as with a weapon); e.g., ""He shines a blade.""Showing Your Ace - Obviously a card reference. An ace is the highest playing card, meaning 'high-quality. When Brendan strips Kara and says ""I'm showing your ace,"" he is saying that Kara's most valuable asset is her beauty, which she uses to manipulate people with (e.g. lap dogs, Dode, etc). Not to mention, ace sounds similar to ass, something else of hers he shows off.Specks - Eyes or Eyeglasses (spectacles); e.g., ""Keep your specks peeled.""Sprang - Originated; e.g., ""His gat sprang from Tugger's gang.""Squawk - To give up or snitch on. Or more apt to this, a stool pigeon.Take A Powder - To slip away; e.g., ""Why'd you take a powder the other night?""Yegg - A criminal.Too bad the list isn't on the DVD; but check out the IMDb entry for more goodies.",5,Watch online or via DVD with subtitles,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,3679,"['Brick', 'fast', 'paced', 'film', 'watching', 'repeatedly', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'online', 'transfer', 'good', 'clear', 'intelligible', 'soundtrack', 'noir', 'slang', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'most.I', 'liked', 'bought', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'commentary', 'track', 'mess', 'other', 'telling', 'film', 'was', 'totally', 'filmed', 'San', 'Clemente', 'California', 'just', 'curiosity', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'two', 'screen', 'tests', 'are', 'ok.The', 'real', 'value', 'DVD', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Spanish', 'French', 'subtitles', 'are', 'also', 'included', ""'ve"", 'included', 'IMDb.com', 'slang', 'list', 'film', 'reading', 'IMDb', 'reveals', 'plot', 'Blow', 'leave', 'depart', 'Did', 'blow', 'last', 'night', 'Brick', 'term', 'used', 'describe', 'pound', 'kilogram', 'drug', 'case', 'film', 'heroin.Bulls', 'Cops', 'e.g.', 'What', 'first', 'tip', 'bulls', 'Also', 'verb', 'turn', 'over', 'cops', 'e.g.', 'bulled', 'rat', 'Burg', 'Burgh', 'Town', 'City', 'e.g.', 'two-bit', 'toker', 'burg', 'C', 'Roman', 'numeral', '100', 'e.g.', 'had', 'C-Note', 'Clam', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'e.g.', 'muscle', ""'ll"", 'clam', 'Copped', 'Obtained', 'copped', 'junk', 'Dose', 'take', 'drugs', 'e.g.', 'dosed', 'off', 'bad', 'junk', 'laid', 'out', 'Duck', 'Soup', 'Easy', 'pickings.Gat', 'Gun.Gum', 'mess', 'things', 'up', 'Bulls', 'would', 'only', 'gum', 'Heel', 'walk', 'away', 'show', 'heels', ""'m"", 'not', 'heeling', 'hook', 'Hook', 'Raise', 'interest', 'get', 'involved', 'e.g', ""'m"", 'not', 'heeling', 'hook', 'Hop/Jake/Junk', 'Drugs', 'Back', 'when', 'noir', 'films', 'were', 'more', 'popular', ""1940's-50"", 'hop', 'often', 'used', 'reference', 'marijuana', 'hophead', 'someone', 'who', 'lot', 'pot.Knives', 'eyes', 'splitting', 'headache', ""'ve"", 'got', 'knives', 'eyes', ""'m"", 'going', 'home', 'sick', 'Lap', 'Dog', 'lap', 'dog', 'defined', 'dog', 'small', 'enough', 'be', 'held', 'arms', 'lay', 'comfortably', 'person', 'lap', 'term', 'also', 'sometimes', 'used', 'describe', 'person', 'who', 'very', 'easily', 'controlled', 'such', 'yes', 'man', 'case', 'Brick', 'definitions', 'are', 'cleverly', 'combined', 'recall', 'scene', 'where', 'first', 'meet', 'Kara', 'freshman', 'boys', 'head', 'lap', 'who', 'command', 'run', 'get', 'purse', 'Nail', 'immediately', 'e.g.', 'cash', 'nail', 'Pick', 'ride', 'car', 'pick-up', 'Did', 'get', 'pick', 'Raise', 'get', 'touch', 'e.g.', 'could', ""n't"", 'raise', 'em', 'also', 'used', 'cleverly', 'when', 'Brain', 'Brendan', 'could', ""n't"", 'raise', 'referring', 'Emily', 'whom', 'could', 'neither', 'contact', 'raise', 'raise', 'dead.Reef', 'Worm', 'stoner', 'reefer', 'patsy', 'take', 'blame', 'scapegoat/', 'fall', 'guy', '.Scraped', 'Begged', 'cadged', 'e.g.', 'Ask', 'dope', 'rat', 'where', 'junk', 'sprang', ""'ll"", 'say', 'scraped', 'off', '[', 'name', ']', 'Shamus', 'private', 'detective.Shine', 'wield', 'weapon', 'blade', 'Showing', 'Ace', 'Obviously', 'card', 'reference', 'ace', 'highest', 'playing', 'card', 'meaning', ""'high-quality"", 'When', 'Brendan', 'Kara', ""'m"", 'showing', 'ace', 'saying', 'Kara', 'most', 'valuable', 'asset', 'beauty', 'manipulate', 'people', 'e.g', 'lap', 'dogs', 'Dode', 'etc', 'Not', 'mention', 'ace', 'similar', 'ass', 'something', 'else', 'hers', 'off.Specks', 'Eyes', 'Eyeglasses', 'spectacles', 'Keep', 'specks', 'peeled', 'Sprang', 'Originated', 'e.g.', 'gat', 'sprang', 'Tugger', 'gang', 'Squawk', 'give', 'up', 'snitch', 'more', 'apt', 'stool', 'pigeon.Take', 'Powder', 'slip', 'away', 'Why', ""'d"", 'take', 'powder', 'other', 'night', 'Yegg', 'criminal.Too', 'bad', 'list', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'check', 'out', 'IMDb', 'entry', 'more', 'goodies']",N/A

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I know it seems strange to say that a film that is emulating 40's film noir is original--yet there is no other description for this delightfully unique little gem. A lot of reviews have been written here--many of them more comprehensive than this one. I do, however, feel compelled to offer a few thoughts.I recommend the film with absolutely no hesitation. The script is smart and engaging, the actors appealing and the conceit of staging a classic noir in a modern, brightly-lit high school actually works. I noticed several reviewers reference ""Veronica Mars""--and the appeal is similar. That is a show that shouldn't work--on paper, it sounded like it could have been a disaster. Yet, it's intelligent and doesn't pander or insult the sophistication of it's audience. That's why I repect BRICK--it is absolutely the movie it wants to be, with no apology.That said, it isn't quite the masterpiece it is being made out to be. I think people are really awed by how ""different"" the film is--and that's why it rates so highly. I definitely appreciate the film's intent and execution, but the stylization is not for everyone's taste. And trust me, I certainly know a couple of people who simply didn't ""get it"".As a lover of film, however, I love filmmakers that show a real knowledge and appreciation of the genres they work in. And I love films that dare to be different.Take a look at BRICK if you're tired of films that require no thought upon viewing.

After all, these are HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.  I laughed out loud at the scene in the vice principals office, as if a vice principal and a student would actually act the way they did.  The whole movie conjured up images of South Park for me, the absurdity of the situations.Strangely enough, this confusion kept me watching.  I just couldn't tell if this was supposed to be some dark commentary on being a teenager (if it did it totally sucks), or if it was supposed to be poking fun at the genre of films by casting the characters as high school students (which, if on purpose, was done brilliantly).",3,Was this a satire on itself?,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,723,"['thought', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'However', 'did', 'get', 'vague', 'notion', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'are', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'STUDENTS', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'scene', 'vice', 'principals', 'office', 'vice', 'principal', 'student', 'would', 'actually', 'act', 'way', 'did', 'whole', 'movie', 'conjured', 'up', 'images', 'South', 'Park', 'absurdity', 'situations.Strangely', 'enough', 'confusion', 'kept', 'watching', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'dark', 'commentary', 'being', 'teenager', 'did', 'totally', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'poking', 'fun', 'genre', 'films', 'casting', 'characters', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'purpose', 'was', 'done', 'brilliantly']",N/A

Now Brendan must find the killer - is it the local drug lord, the drama queen, the hit man, or the enigmatic cheerleader?If you're looking for something really different, ""Brick"" is for you.  Rian Johnson wrote and directed ""Brick"" as an homage to the film noir style of the forties.  To call the characters and dialogue ""hard-boiled"" would be an understatement. They are all jaded and calloused and see little or no value in life.  They speak in a teen/drug code that is so unique I actually had to turn on the subtitles to understand it.  That didn't detract from the movie, however.  Once I figured out what the slang meant, it was a fascinating new language.Joseph Gordon-Levitt has matured a lot since he was in3rd Rock From the Sun.  He carries the movie with his James Dean-charisma and brooding charm.  Lukas Haas gives a subtle, eerie performance as a club-footed drug lord.  There is only one adult in the movie, making the teens seem even more alone and alienated from mainstream society.

But that weird little experiment was not half bad and ""Brick"" is a lot more successful in trying to pull this off and is a lot closer to ""Sin City"" than to ""Bugsy Malone.""  ""Brick"" won the Sundance Film Festival's Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision, and you have to grant writer-director Rian Johnson that much for sure.At the start of the film, Johnson's hero Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds the dead body of Emily (Emilie de Ravin) in a drainage ditch.  She had called him earlier in the day pleading for help and later saw her in the back seat of a car as it drove away.  Now she is dead.  So he decides to find out who killed her and starts backtracking on what she had been doing and with whom.  The only one Brendan can trust is the Brain (Matt O'Leary), who is basically a walking computer who observes a lot by just watching while it seems he is working on his computer or solving a Rubik's Cube.  This leads him to the high school drug ring and the major players, although not without Brendan getting his face smashed in a few times in his effort to shake things up and see what happens next.The other players are the Pin (Lukas Haas), Tugger (Noah Fleiss), Dode (Noah Segan), and Brad Bramish (Brian J. White), with Laura (Nora Zehetner) and Kara (Meagan Good) as the femme fatales.  Beyond that last alliterative appellation I do not want to say who is what because half the fun here is in watching Brendan find out who is what.  The other half is listening to what these characters have to say, because the rhythms are Hammet's, but the glossary is often idiosyncratic and the dynamic is pure high school (My favorite is when Brendan is engaged in a conversation that has descended down to both parties saying ""Yeah"" a lot and he finally shoots back, ""There's a thesaurus in the library. Yeah is under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait"").While for the most part this movie takes place in a Charlie Brown world where adults are absent, there are a few notable exceptions.  Brendan has been of use to Assistant Vice Principal Trueman (Richard Roundtree) in the past, but that relationship is now tenuous.  However, it does suggest that the ""bulls"" are out there somewhere, and Brendan has to get to the bottom of things without or at least before the authorities get involved.  Then there is the Pin's mother (Reedy Gibbs), whom I mention simply because very rarely do you get to see a criminal mastermind's mother putter around the kitchen making sure everybody has something to drink.Everybody in ""Brick"" is dead serious about what they are doing and they never blink an eye at all of the verbiage that comes spilling out every time they start flapping their gums.  The illusion of this strange reality is maintained from start to finish, when Brendan confronts the guilty party in the middle of a high school football field.  At that point Johnson most clearly invites comparisons to ""The Maltese Falcon"" because at this point he knows that you have either bought the game plan here and will enjoy the more overt homage, or this would be the final nail in the coffin.  For me the results are certainly enough to warrant rounding up on this 2005 film and to hope that Johnson can find something equally creative for his next venture.  That will be hard to do, but you have to feel that based on ""Brick"" he might be able to carry it off and not be a one cult classic wonder.Final Note: Is Emilie de Ravin ever allowed to play a character that is not pregnant?  I am just asking, because after ""Roswell"" and ""Lost"" we are now at the point where that seems to be all she plays and I can just see Hollywood execs saying ""We need an actress to play a young pregnant woman, go get Emilie de Ravin.""  If she ever does become pregnant for real people are going to look at her and ask what movie she is doing it for.",5,Rian Johnson plays out a Dashiell Hammett film noir in a high school setting,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,4531,"['know', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'watching', 'Brick', 'have', 'do', 'answer', 'rather', 'odd', 'little', 'question', 'Are', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'hard-boiled', 'detective', 'story', 'played', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'film', 'Now', 'are', 'fan', 'Hammett', 'book', 'and/or', 'movie', 'version', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'idea', 'teenagers', 'spouting', 'dialogue', 'were', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'Kaspar', 'Gutman', 'trapped', 'younger', 'bodies', 'might', 'be', 'enough', 'put', 'off', 'lunch', 'already', 'Furthermore', 'are', 'well', 'versed', 'American', 'cinema', 'idea', 'might', 'bring', 'mind', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'Bugsy', 'Malone', 'put', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'bunch', 'other', 'pre-teens', '1930s', 'Chicago', 'gangster', 'movie', 'weird', 'little', 'experiment', 'was', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'Brick', 'lot', 'more', 'successful', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'lot', 'closer', 'Sin', 'City', 'Bugsy', 'Malone', 'Brick', 'won', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Special', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'Originality', 'Vision', 'have', 'grant', 'writer-director', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'much', 'sure.At', 'start', 'film', 'Johnson', 'hero', 'Brendan', 'Frye', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'dead', 'body', 'Emily', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'drainage', 'ditch', 'had', 'called', 'earlier', 'day', 'pleading', 'help', 'later', 'saw', 'back', 'seat', 'car', 'drove', 'away', 'Now', 'dead', 'So', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'backtracking', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'whom', 'only', 'one', 'Brendan', 'can', 'trust', 'Brain', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'who', 'basically', 'walking', 'computer', 'who', 'lot', 'just', 'watching', 'working', 'computer', 'solving', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'high', 'school', 'drug', 'ring', 'major', 'players', 'not', 'Brendan', 'getting', 'face', 'smashed', 'few', 'times', 'effort', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'see', 'what', 'next.The', 'other', 'players', 'are', 'Pin', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'Tugger', 'Noah', 'Fleiss', 'Dode', 'Noah', 'Segan', 'Brad', 'Bramish', 'Brian', 'J', 'White', 'Laura', 'Nora', 'Zehetner', 'Kara', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'femme', 'fatales', 'Beyond', 'last', 'alliterative', 'appellation', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'say', 'who', 'what', 'fun', 'here', 'watching', 'Brendan', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'other', 'half', 'listening', 'what', 'characters', 'have', 'say', 'rhythms', 'are', 'Hammet', 'glossary', 'often', 'idiosyncratic', 'dynamic', 'pure', 'high', 'school', 'My', 'favorite', 'when', 'Brendan', 'engaged', 'conversation', 'descended', 'down', 'parties', 'saying', 'Yeah', 'lot', 'finally', 'shoots', 'back', 'thesaurus', 'library', 'Y', 'Go', 'ahead', ""'ll"", 'wait', '.While', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'place', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'world', 'where', 'adults', 'are', 'absent', 'are', 'few', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'Brendan', 'been', 'use', 'Assistant', 'Vice', 'Principal', 'Trueman', 'Richard', 'Roundtree', 'past', 'relationship', 'now', 'tenuous', 'However', 'suggest', 'bulls', 'are', 'there', 'somewhere', 'Brendan', 'get', 'bottom', 'things', 'least', 'authorities', 'get', 'involved', 'Then', 'Pin', 'mother', 'Reedy', 'Gibbs', 'whom', 'mention', 'simply', 'very', 'rarely', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'mother', 'putter', 'kitchen', 'making', 'sure', 'everybody', 'something', 'drink.Everybody', 'Brick', 'dead', 'serious', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'never', 'blink', 'eye', 'verbiage', 'spilling', 'out', 'time', 'start', 'flapping', 'gums', 'illusion', 'strange', 'reality', 'maintained', 'start', 'finish', 'when', 'Brendan', 'guilty', 'party', 'middle', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'field', 'point', 'Johnson', 'most', 'clearly', 'comparisons', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'because', 'point', 'have', 'bought', 'game', 'plan', 'here', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'overt', 'homage', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'results', 'are', 'certainly', 'enough', 'warrant', 'rounding', 'up', '2005', 'film', 'hope', 'Johnson', 'can', 'find', 'something', 'equally', 'creative', 'next', 'venture', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'do', 'have', 'feel', 'based', 'Brick', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'carry', 'off', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'cult', 'classic', 'wonder.Final', 'Note', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'ever', 'allowed', 'play', 'character', 'not', 'pregnant', 'am', 'just', 'asking', 'Roswell', 'Lost', 'are', 'now', 'point', 'where', 'be', 'can', 'just', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'execs', 'saying', 'need', 'actress', 'play', 'young', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'go', 'get', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'ever', 'become', 'pregnant', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'look', 'ask', 'what', 'movie', 'doing']",N/A
173756,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,1417068329,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 3]","""Brick"" is an edgy, roughly cut film, shot on a shoestring.  Director Rian Johnson's next film ""The Brothers Bloom"" is due out early next year & has Nora Zehetner who played Laura & Noah Segum who played Dode.  Johnson's screenplay won awards from Central Ohio Film Critics Association and San Francisco Film Critics Circle.  Johnson was nominated as a promising director by the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards and by the Sitges-Catalonian International Film Festival.  The film won a special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.Joseph Gordon Levitt was excellent in bothStop-Loss&Mysterious Skin (Deluxe Unrated Director's Edition).  For those of us who laughed hard at TV's ""Third Rock from the Sun,"" it's wonderful to see his growth as an actor, perhaps poised to become a major star with the right film.  As Brendan, he carried his love on his sleeve as he seeks to find out the truth behind his girlfriend's murder.  He is unable to turn off his feelings or abandon his search, despite the fact that she broke up with him & apparently did not love him.Norh Zehetner plays Laura, a wealthy high school student, invited to the right parties.  She goes with a football star to enhance her status.  She is more than two-faced.  As Rian Johnson creates the role, we are always interested to see what face will next emerge.Lukas Haas plays the Pin, a small-time drug dealer with his own student criminal organization.  The guy's looks are so odd with a cane and crazy hairstyle, that Haas' very minimal controlled acting style seems almost at odds with the dialogue.  It is a very interesting performance and treatment of the character.Noah Fleiss turns in an excellent performance as Tugger.  He becomes more prominent as the film unravels.  His hair-trigger temper explodes repeatedly at a moment's provocation.  Fleiss seems to perfect this repeated assault.Matt O'Leary who was in a film I didn't happen to care for titledFrailtyplays the Brain.  His character supports Brendan as his backup and support.  One of the flaws I found with the script was the lack of integration of the Brain to the plot.  I had no idea why he and Brendan were so cooperative.  The final scene on the football field made the relationship even more nebulous.  I found myself wondering if the film would have been tighter had his character been written out.  That said, O'Leary certainly seemed every part the brainy nerd masking a whole other world of experience.Emile de Ravin played Tess on a favorite TV show of mine, ""Roswell.""  She has also played Claire Littleton on TV's ""Lost.""  I found the plastic blue bracelets that hang limp in the water on the DVD front cover to echo a cheapness to which her character Emily aspires.  De Ravin brings complexity to the role's limited screen time.Noah Segun plays the dimwitted, thick-headed boyfriend of Emily.  I found it interesting to watch his screentest in the DVD extras, very minimal acting, but well in character throughout.  As Dode, Segun brings a childlike charm to a goth exterior.  He looked better in the screentest, which is probably Johnson's point.Richard Roundtree plays Assistant Vice Principal Trueman in a great cameo.  His banter with Brendan is as bouncy as ping-pong match.  Meagan Good has nice moments as Kara, a stage chanteuse who enjoys Asian makeup.In the beginning of the film, I found the fast-paced language incomprehensible much of the time.  I kept asking myself, ""What'd they say?""  Even when I rewound to get what they said, I still had no clue what it meant.  As the film unwinds, we acclimate to a hip lingo that is often a cool shorthand that provides the missing pieces of the puzzle.  I liked the very practical commentary by Rian Johnson in the DVD extras.  For example, he talks about having to re-shoot the final football field scene with Brendan and Laura, but having to shoot their faces from the ground up to mask the changes that had been made to green the football field.  I enjoyed the film, appreciating how Johnson gives free reign to his supporting characters to shine.  This is worth an evening's entertainment.

173757,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,1417068329,Lleu Christopher,"[12, 26]","I was not originally planning to review this film, as it didn't make much of an impression on me. What changed my mind was the fact that all of the reviews posted so far are highly favorable, so I felt a dissenting opinion should be represented. I had heard that Brick was done in film noir style set in a modern high school. What I didn't realize until I started watching it is how far they took this gimmick. Brick is not really pure film noir; it has a strange, surreal style of its own. The settings are mostly deserted landscapes. The school that these ""kids"" attend is usually devoid of students, aside from the few who are playing in the scene. Characters are frequently shown lethargically lying on the pavement. There is a perpetual mood of exaggerated somberness. I'm sure there is a deep explanation of what this is supposed to convey or symbolize, but I just found it oppressively dull after a few minutes. The high school characters exist in a world almost devoid of adults. In this respect, it is reminiscent of Bugsy Malone, the musical gangster movie starring all children. That film, however, was lighthearted and unapologetically silly. Brick, by contrast, is heavy, serious and stilted. It's hard to judge the acting in a film like this. I suppose, given the concept and direction, they all do a pretty good job. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fine impression of a teen-aged Bogart --if you can buy into it. In a way, the super-cool teens of Brick are magnified versions of the hipster cast of shows like Beverly Hills 90210. While most teens in real life are a balance between cool and self-conscious awkwardness, in Brick everyone exhibits flawless film version sang-froid at all times.I should confess that I'm not a huge fan of film noir. Even when watching a classic film of this genre, or perhaps a modern David Mamet film, I may enjoy it on one level (if the acting and plot are good), but I can't help but thinking things like ""who really talks like this all the time?"" In Brick, what we have is a double layer of artifice -teens imitating an unnatural adult manner.

With some great performances (including a slyer than ever Joseph Gordon Levitt) and slickly witty slang dialogue, Johnson takes a seemingly simple premise and adds some innovative flavor to create a deadly original yarn.Brendan (Levitt), having recently discovered the corpse of an old lover, plays the role of detective in search for answers. On the way to the truth, he crosses paths with a seemingly perfect damsel, a manipulative school theater actress, a cool brainiac, an overheated muscle for a young crime syndicate, and a cane-toting coat-wearing drug kingpin (and his mother).Featuring crisp dialogue, atmospheric cinematography, organicly sparse music, and a downright cool style, Brick is a force to be reckoned with, and a refreshingly original take on the neo-noir genre.As for the R-Rating, I'm almost confused as to why the film was rated so harshly. There is no cursing, little violence, and while the drug content is integral to the story no drug use is ever actually portrayed on the film (other than cigarette smoking). In my opinion the film should have gotten a PG-13 from the MPAA.About the DVD: Great transfer, clear picture, great sound. Focus Features has a way with making all of their products very well.

The whole time I was watching, I was trying to find out what was going on with this subculture that seemed to exist beneath the veneer of a high school. There grows a feeling of urgency in Brendan's situation, although we're not exactly sure what that is just yet... He's trying to do something - and given his actions - it must be something important. It was somewhat suspenseful and interesting enough to keep me watching. The characters are also fairly interesting, even if only in their mysteriousness. Tug, who is muscle for ""The Pin"", is a crazy MF'er and helps to make the story more edgy with his outbursts of violence and his lack of attempt to control them.This is a pretty good flick.

It's a nice idea and follows a similar plot to the investigations with a few twists and turns along the way.Everyone does a good job in their roles, in particular the lead. Without the style gimmick it's a solid enough film, everyone plays their part and the story unfolds at a decent pace. The style does set it apart, but also proves it undoing.The issue is that it comes across as a student film with the kids playing roles of the noir style. It's well filmed which does set it up a step higher than that, but still the impression remains. While it does present an interesting juxtaposition it did hamper my enjoyment somewhat.That leaves it as a film that's a bit tricky to rate, it's a decent enough film, but not as entertaining as it might have been.

I had heard about ""Brick"" for a while now, and when I heard the premise of it, I knew that it was something that I would have to check out.  I'm glad I did, because not only did I end up enjoying it the first time I saw it, but I watched it again the next day.  Not many films can do that for me, but this one most certainly did.  There was no way I could have ever bet that I would've ended up loving this movie the way I do.If you're unfamiliar with the approach to the movie, it's pretty much a detective-murder-whodunit movie with a catch; it's set in modern times and it involves high school kids.  Yet, the kids talk in the manner that you would expect from your typical hard-boiled detective movie.  The story concerns Brendan Frye, who is contacted by his ex-girlfriend by phone.  On the phone, she sounds frightened and troubled, but doesn't say much about what is the matter.  Two days later, she ends up dead.  Brendan knows that she got involved with the wrong crowd, so in order to find out who is responsible for her death and why, he has to go in deep into the underground drug world that has consumed a good amount of his schoolmates.  The deeper he goes, the more risk he puts himself in.This film is extremely well done and well made, and that caught me off guard.  I wasn't expecting a movie like this, nor was I expecting that I would end up loving it so much.  The film seems innocent and fun at a glance until you really get into it, and then you realize how dark and brutal it can get.  Just because it involves high school kids, it doesn't mean it's child's play.  It's film noir at its finest, and it even pokes fun at itself a little here and there, but overall it's a pretty dark and serious movie.  What really sells the movie in the end is the great performances from the cast, especially the lead actor.Because of how odd and different ""Brick"" is, there's a good chance that more people will end up not liking it so much.  That is the risk these kinds of movies take, but it's nice to see something that isn't so ""commercial friendly"" for a change.  It stands out, and that's something that has to be admired to some degree.  I would recommend renting it first because of this.  Also, I recommend that you see it more than once.  As much as I liked it the first time, I really appreciated it for what it was more during the second viewing.  The DVD doesn't have a whole lot to offer, sadly.  There are some deleted/extended scenes, audition tapes from two of the actors in the movie, and cast/crew commentary.  It's a shame that they don't give you the trailer, which I thought was really good.  I also would've liked to see some behind-the-scenes features.""Brick"" took me for a ride and I have to say that I loved every minute of it.  It's an exhilarating and brilliant film that takes a lot of chances without apologizing to anybody in the end.  It's one you'll either love or hate, but I think it's definitely worth the time checking it out.  If you're looking for something that isn't typical or dull, then I highly recommend it.  It's too soon to say, but I think if you give it enough time it could become a classic.  It's high up on my list of favorite movies now, and that only took two days.  -Michael Crane",5,"""There's not much chance of coming out clean...""",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,3383,"['have', 'say', 'Brick', 'probably', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'so', 'far', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'see', 'will', 'top', 'had', 'heard', 'Brick', 'while', 'now', 'when', 'heard', 'premise', 'knew', 'was', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'check', 'out', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'enjoying', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'watched', 'again', 'next', 'day', 'Not', 'many', 'films', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'most', 'certainly', 'did', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'would', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'loving', 'movie', 'way', 'do.If', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'approach', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'detective-murder-whodunit', 'movie', 'catch', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'kids', 'talk', 'manner', 'would', 'expect', 'typical', 'hard-boiled', 'detective', 'movie', 'story', 'concerns', 'Brendan', 'Frye', 'who', 'contacted', 'ex-girlfriend', 'phone', 'phone', 'frightened', 'troubled', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'what', 'matter', 'Two', 'days', 'later', 'up', 'dead', 'Brendan', 'got', 'involved', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'so', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'responsible', 'death', 'why', 'go', 'deep', 'underground', 'drug', 'world', 'consumed', 'good', 'amount', 'schoolmates', 'deeper', 'more', 'risk', 'in.This', 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'made', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'innocent', 'fun', 'glance', 'really', 'get', 'then', 'realize', 'how', 'dark', 'brutal', 'can', 'get', 'Just', 'high', 'school', 'kids', ""n't"", 'mean', 'child', 'play', 'film', 'noir', 'finest', 'even', 'fun', 'little', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'pretty', 'dark', 'serious', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'movie', 'end', 'great', 'performances', 'cast', 'especially', 'lead', 'actor.Because', 'how', 'odd', 'different', 'Brick', 'good', 'chance', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'liking', 'so', 'much', 'risk', 'kinds', 'movies', 'take', 'nice', 'see', 'something', ""n't"", 'so', 'commercial', 'friendly', 'change', 'out', 'something', 'be', 'admired', 'degree', 'would', 'recommend', 'renting', 'first', 'Also', 'recommend', 'see', 'more', 'once', 'As', 'much', 'liked', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'appreciated', 'what', 'was', 'more', 'second', 'viewing', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'offer', 'sadly', 'are', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'audition', 'tapes', 'two', 'actors', 'movie', 'cast/crew', 'commentary', 'shame', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'trailer', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'also', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'behind-the-scenes', 'features', 'Brick', 'took', 'ride', 'have', 'say', 'loved', 'minute', 'exhilarating', 'brilliant', 'film', 'lot', 'chances', 'apologizing', 'anybody', 'end', 'one', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'think', 'definitely', 'time', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', ""n't"", 'typical', 'dull', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'too', 'soon', 'say', 'think', 'give', 'enough', 'time', 'could', 'become', 'classic', 'high', 'up', 'list', 'favorite', 'movies', 'now', 'only', 'took', 'two', 'days', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A

Brick is sure to please the smaller group of moviegoers, meaning those that can accept the film for what it is: different.This is a film with an imperfect blend. There is the cultist's favorite noir, the gritty suburban life of today, and the impasse teen flick that for some reason is stunningly original on a level not seen before.The story, while complex in form, is at the core a simple mystery. Brendan Frye (Levitt) is a loner at a high school mixed with problems from the inner street. After happening upon a message from his ex-girlfriend, Frye follows the murky leads to help her out. Unfortunately, what Frye stumbles upon is a loose string of problems that seemingly bring him nonlinearly from one point to another. With each discovery is another step away from the truth and one more reminder that this may be a bad idea.Having overstayed his welcome in teenage filler, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (3rd Rock From The Sun, Ten Things I Hate About You) graduates with flying colors and accentuates into what might be regarded as the modern day Serpico. Levitt not only steals the film, but nails the character right smack into the skull. He takes the source material and goes the extra mile creating one of the better anti-heroes this century has seen thus far.Everything works here. From bar none the most eccentric dialogue since 1971's A Clockwork Orange to a chilling and fitting soundtrack by composer Nathan Johnson, who takes hints from the late Bernard Herrmann. There is a mood to this film that is neither claustrophobic nor horrifying yet glides dangerously around those lines at all times.Inarguably one of the most exciting and refreshing pictures since 2004's experimental Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Director Rian Johnson much like Michael Gondry paints a modern classic that is sure to have people spinning in and out of their seats. This is a story that follows you home with characters that might be your friends.It is a relief to have a breath of fresh air in an industry so heavily polluted with either the same thing or something less spectacular.

173768,A1FG91CM8221X1,1417068329,Miles D. Moore,"[49, 53]","Rian Johnson's ""Brick"" won a Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Festival for originality of vision, and seldom has an award been more deserved. This witty, breathlessly entertaining low-budget flick conflates modern-day high-school angst with the mean-street conventions of 1940s detective fiction and movies. The surprise is that director/screenwriter Johnson plays the story absolutely straight, and gets away with it, while at the same time touching on some uncomfortable truths about growing up in America. Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whose delicate, poetic looks belie his limitless resources of toughness and courage, goes underground among his school's drug-addled ""upper crust"" to uncover the murderers of his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emilie de Ravin). He endures multiple beatings from the goon Tugger (Noah Fleiss), as well as threats from both The Pin (Lukas Haas), a cadaverous criminal mastermind who still lives with his doting mother, and Assistant Vice Principal Trueman (Richard Roundtree), who basically plays the Barton McLane role to Gordon-Levitt's Bogart. Then there are the femmes fatales in training, Laura (Nora Zehetner) and Kara (Meagan Good), who may or may not be helping Brendan. ""Brick"" is remarkably stylish and atmospheric for its miniscule budget; Johnson is masterful at capturing the claustrophobic milieu in which Brendan and his antagonists lurk. There are scenes of action and suspense here that put big-budget epics like ""V for Vendetta"" to shame, simply because Johnson knows how to edit, and because he makes us care about the characters, especially Brendan. I never paid much attention to Gordon-Levitt until I saw his performance as an emotionally damaged male prostitute in Gregg Araki's ""Mysterious Skin."" Based on his performances here and in that film, I would say that Gordon-Levitt is quickly becoming one of the truly great American screen actors. All the other actors are also fine, including Matt O'Leary as The Brain, Brendan's informant and only true friend, and Noah Segan as the pathetic ""reef worm"" Dode. Some critics have complained about ""Brick's"" convoluted plot and stylized dialogue--Johnson creates a language for his characters that is half Chandleresque slang, half teen speak.

This isn't the sort of movie you can guarantee that others will like.The literal-minded 'this is unrealistic' criticisms miss the point, of course. The film knows it isn't realistic, and even winks at you (e.g., the mom serving apple juice). The same can be said of grumbling about the convuluted plot and slangy dialog (that's the nature of the genre). I do think, however, that the muddy sound of the dialog is a problem. You end up missing some great lines (and you shouldn't need subtitles).What I like best is, despite the small budget, Brick is great to look at.

I will say that I am a 63-yr. old grandfather, but consider myself a film fan and fairly 'with it' regarding current popular culture.I found the movie very interesting and even riveting at times. I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a terrific talent and has a very bright future. When I was watching this I could not help but reflect back upon my own high school experience. Maybe I lived a pretty sheltered life. I love documentary films because they deal in reality, and credibility ranks high upon my requirements for a good 'fiction' movie, at least a good crime or drama. Not so sure how high this one would rank on the credibility scale. I kept wondering if we would ever see a parent--aside from The Pin's dutiful mother--and I wondered if the kids ever went to biology class or algebra or social studies. But when you consider that the writer has basically fashioned a 40's-era LA crime noir but used a modern California high school as the setting, you start to get it.After all, they're constantly updating Romeo and Juliet and other Shakespeare plays, so why can't they do it with this one? Give it a chance; I would suppose that younger viewers might be more open to it. But oldsters like me might get hung up on the believability aspect. It's difficult to imagine high-schoolers being this sophisticated, or devious, but if you suspend your sense of credibility and let the story take you along, you might enjoy it.

But after that, I heard very little about the movie.  Then, I just happened to see it at Target.  Well, I have thrown away plenty of good money over the years just buying DVDs brand new without watching it beforehand.  So, I went to Hollywood video and picked it up used for about $8.00.  All I can say is that it was one of the best movie purchases I have made in a long time.I'm no professional reviewer (as you can tell from my other reviews) but this movie grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go.  It takes a bunch of high school kids and throws them in an adult situation.  A kid's ex-girlfriend is found dead and he wants to find out whodunit.  That's the movie's premise.  But the path from Point A to Point B is a twisted one full of quick dialogue and beautiful camera shots.  I had to watch it with the subtitles on so I could catch everything that was said.  The way the movie bounces around and has several interesting characters reminds me of a Tarantino movie.  I'm no expert in the film noir genre as the review by Amazon states this movie is, but if this is what the genre holds, I will become a fan.  I'm not going to go into the plot of the movie because other people have done that already, so go read their reviews if that's what you want.  It's a strong film with a hardly-known cast.  Some of them will look familiar to you, but you probably won't remember where you have seen them.  All of the performances are solid and not put aside by a big-named star like other films auffer from.  The movie seems like a cross between Clerks (for its quick dialogue--although not humorous like Clerks--and independent feel), a Tarantino movie (for its unique characters) and L.A.

173774,AKYNIMNI8LOBP,1417068329,"Mr. Richard K. Weems ""emperor_weems""","[5, 5]","I had seen a preview or two of this movie and was interested immediately, but it was only when I saw this movie listed somewhere as one of the top 20 high school movies of all time, in the same category as such classic as Heathers and Ferris Beuller, that I was now fully intrigued.  What makes a film about high school a classic for me is when it studies the absurdity of high school, the social circles that are designed more to torture individuals than promote them.  And this is someone who was not just ostracized in high school, but has also come back to teach in it.And to boot, this film also has the edge of making the world of this high school the setting of film noir.The main story has to do with Brendan, an outsider who eats lunch behind the school building nowadays, who gets a note of desperation from her old flame, Emily.  Emily is in trouble, but she can't say exactly what trouble she is in, which leads Brendan on a search through the culture of his school.  With an informant named Brain, a classic geek who even works on a Rubrics Cube, Brendan delves into the world of the jocks, the beautiful people, and the burn-outs to work a plan that will have all involved exposing themselves to his limelights.  There is, of course, a beautiful but possibly treacherous femme fatale, a Tolkein-reading drug dealer along with his fists-for-brains muscle, and a vice principal who sounds more like a police seargant in a crooked town than a suit with a degree.But this film doesn't just work on the level of film noir appreciation.  The social hell that is high school seems a fitting setting for this homage, so the technique seems quite fitting.  The dialogue is wonderful to listen to, though it gets a little troublesome when it is being used to advance the plot, for the delivery is quick (as it is supposed to be, but still sometimes hard to follow) and the names almost too numerous to keep an even handle on.  A bit of a score card is needed to keep track of some things, but a lot of this works out in fascinating ways, the plots within plots within plots led on by this tough plain-T-shirt wearing smart mouth who can throw a punch when he has to but also gets beat up about as much as Gabriel Byrne's character in Miller's Crossing.Not the top 5 in the realm of high school film, but definitely within the top 20.

The meeting turns out to be a phone call in which she briefly tells of the trouble she has gotten into before expressing fear at an approaching car. After she hangs up Brendan tracks her down and she tells him that she is fine and there aren't any problems. The next day Brendan finds her dead and charges himself with the task of finding her killer......The good: I was pretty hyped about this movie after viewing the trailer. It looked cool and edgy. The film noir concept for this movie was a good idea and I thought the concept of the movie was good.The Bad: I felt like the writer ""tried"" too hard when putting the dialogue for this film together. There was too much of an attempt to make the characters appear cool and edgy through their slang which often made it hard to understand what the hell they were saying. I found myself on several occasions rewinding and re-listening so I could understand what they were talking about. I felt like they were speaking in white ebonics or something of that nature. The characters all felt waaay too mature to be high school kids. Their reactions to situations and there motivations made them feel more like they were 20ish or 30ish instead of like the teenagers they were portraying. This gave the movie an odd feel. I think this was done because teens like to think they come across as mature as the characters in this movie do (Target audience is teens). The characters should have been made older or the story and plot should have been dumbed down some. I also found myself wondering where all the adults were.

Please do not let the absence of familiar names and faces deter you from seeing Brick. I thought it was a very clever and entertaining piece of work.Reading the synopsis provided with the movie (I apologize for not having it available) would tell you to expect an elaborate drug-related plot involving a bunch of high school students. I was drawn to the movie by the trailer from which I had little knowledge of the movie, just an unexplained interest in seeing it. I was hesitant from the synopsis, but it must not have deterred me for too long! What type of ridiculous drug plot could a handful of 16-, 17- and 18-year-old kids actually get into? How far fetched is this story line going to be?Forget all of that. What the creative team did was take a story that has essentially become clich&eacute; in modern cinema and breathed new life into it. A disinterested, scorned man receives a cry for help from his ex-girlfriend and avails himself of a few liberties not necessarily intended for private citizens under the law only to find the trail to her is long and ultimately leads to a drug king-pin. So far so normal. What was unique to Brick was the high-school setting. You have kids living with their parents trying to uncover conspiracies between classes. Sounds ridiculous, right? Exactly.

Crime Novels of the 1930's and 1940's), and it is easy to see how noir fiction became such a rich source of creative movie-making. ""Brick"" is the latest in a series of great (""Chinatown,"" ""Mulholland Drive,"" ""Blue Velvet"") and very good movies (""L.A. Confidential,"" ""Heist,"" ""The Grifters,"" ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") that use the trappings of noir literature and earlier noir films. ""Brick"" adapts the dialogue and plots of Dashiell Hammett to a setting familiar to the screenwriter/director: a Southern California high school, the cliques of teenagers therein, and a familiarity with illicit drug dealing. The speech of the characters works because the teenagers are still kids, despite the serious themes and deadly consequences.There's humor inherent in putting young people into the noir setting, but its not the noir that's the target of easy jokes. It's not so much a joke, as in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" that the main character gets himself beat up, but the humor comes from a tense confrontation between gumshoes and kingpin being interrupted by the kingpin's mom serving orange juice. Funny in ""Brick,"" but also a point of realism: drug dealers are often teenagers who do in fact bring their business (and violence) into their parents' kitchens. Much of the surreal ""where I eat lunch"" type of dialogue can be seen as a device to show how a lot of teens turn to dope and dope-dealing to shoehorn themselves into adult roles. The only meaningful adult-teen interaction, fittingly, comes between Gordon-Levitt's character and the school principal, played by the great Richard Roundtree.The acting in this film is top-notch and a great pleasure to see. The empty high school setting reflects the isolation the protagonist lives in, and we are shown only the meaningful (or perhaps remembered) aspects of his days. Compare this to another earnest film about high school, ""Elephant,"" and it's easy to see how professional actors and the elimination of background clutter makes for a better presentation. It's also nice to see that ""Brick"" has a healthy number of passionate defenders on the Amazon page. Hopefully, Gordon-Levitt continues to take on roles like the ones in ""Brick"" and ""Mysterious Skin.""

I was immediately drawn into it, mostly by the presence of the lead, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a very appealing young actor.  As I watched it all I could think of was how times had changed since I went to high school...!  Yeah, everyone knows kids do drugs now but the extremity of the plot and the violence...Well, I know it was Los Angeles, but still...Call me Gramma Moses or something but it defied reality for me.  I know kids (excuse me for using this term, but they are supposed to be high school age so I don't know what else to call them) are smart these days but this smart?  Gee, who writes their dialog?I agree with others that the lead is miscast.  Charming and cute as he is, he didn't seem street-smart and tough as I guess he was supposed to be.  He seemed like a bookish, serious type who is never too far away from his glasses.  (It's amazing that his glasses survived through all of the physical abuse he took.)  It was just not believable to me that such a sweet, physically frail looking guy would put himself in such horrendous danger over and over.  I kept wondering where his parents were?  Did he have any?  He really looked like a nice boy from a nice home who would probably be going to an Ivy League school the next year.Ok, so it wasn't supposed to be realistic but it was shot in a realistic way and that's what made it not really work for me.  It wasn't ""noir"" in the sense of the classic noir films. It is shot in sunny southern California, in brilliant color.  In classic noir films the people are hard nosed middle aged types, not fresh faced innocents like most of these kids.  (The hero doesn't even smoke!)I did turn the subtitles on and it helped.  Mostly I could follow the plot but sometimes the names were too confusing....the Pin, Tug, Dode, etc.  Some of the dialogue, even with the subtitles, was completely incomprehensible.  The charm of Gordon-Levitt did keep me caring, through all of the plot twists and carnage.  But, ten minutes after the film was over, I stopped caring...make that five minutes.I give it four stars because, well I guess I was impressed by it, but then I'm probably too easily impressed.

173791,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,1417068329,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 4]","Brick (Rian Johnson, 2005)Brick was listed at moviefone as one of the fifty best movies of 2006-- in fact, it sits on that list at number ten. Interestingly, just about every other review of the movie I've read was more hesitant in its praise, as if no one could believe that young filmmaker Rian Johnson and Third Rock from the Sun cutie Joseph Gordon-Levitt could take this admittedly ludicrous idea-- set a noir film straight out of the forties, archaic dialogue and all, in a modern suburban high school-- and pull it off. The evidence, however, can now be seen on DVD, and Johnson pulls it off tremendously.Gordon-Levitt's last two roles have been the kinds of things that kill careers in Hollywood on a regular basis-- first as a gay hustler in Gregg Araki's strong adaptation of Scott Heim's Mysterious Skin, and now as a guy who does the shuffle-and-mumble better than anyone since Crispin Glover in Wild at Heart. Gordon-Levitt here plays Brendan, a kid who, in the opening scene, is crouched in a culvert, staring at a body who may or may not be dead. We quickly learn that said body is that of his girlfriend (or ex-girlfriend, neither he nor we are ever truly sure) Emily (Emilie de Ravin of Lost); that she is, in fact, quite dead; and that Brendan is determined to find out why for the thoroughly archaic (but oh so noir) reason that, well, she asked him to help her out of a jam. Her new status as a member of the recently-living isn't going to stop him from doing his thing. This leads him to run-ins with psychotic hash addict Dode (Adam and Steve's Noah Segan) and local druglord The Pin (Lukas Haas, recently of the underrated Long Time Dead), the character around whom most of the film's criticism actually seems to center. And rightly, to an extent, for The Pin is a character you're not likely to forget. He's the quirkiest of a quirky bunch, a drug kingpin (hence the nickname) who lives and works in his mother's basement, has a right-hand man who puts one in mind of Marky Mark during his rapping days (The Laramie Project's Noah Fleiss)-- and his presence in the movie, with his style of dress, seems to date the film, which puts the lie to a number of criticisms about realism-- supplant this high school and this plot to the eighties/early nineties, and a lot of seeming anachronisms go away), and has so many affectations that he almost screams ""I'm a parody!"" And yet, somehow, Haas carries the role with an amazing amount of menace. If you can get through the first confrontation between Brendan and The Pin without thinking how unforgivably silly the whole thing is, then you've been well and truly roped in by this movie.

Zwick,"[9, 19]","**1/2You at least gotta give `em points for trying.That's about the best that can be said for the people who made ""Brick,"" an ambitious, though ultimately misguided, attempt to set a film noir drama on a contemporary high school campus.Joseph Gordon-Levitt - who, in ""Mysterious Skin,"" delivered one of the best film performances of 2005 - is here completely miscast as a tough-talking teen investigating the  death of his beloved ex-girlfriend, most likely at the hands of some local drug dealers.  In all fairness to Gordon-Levitt, however, it should be pointed out that in ""Skin,"" he was called upon to play a real life person with real life feelings and emotions, which he did to perfection.  In ""Brick,"" the character is anything BUT real; rather, he is a deliberately artificial construct designed by writer/director Rian Johnson to move the plot along and to enhance the film noir atmosphere.  Yet, there is something inherently ludicrous in having modern teens speaking in the clipped phrasing and arch wordiness typical of 1940's film noir characters.  Actors like Bogart, Lancaster and Widmark didn't just have their tough-guy status conferred on them; they had to earn it, through the kind of wisdom and gravitas that come only with age and a life composed largely of hard knocks, both physical and psychological.  We always understood that it was the baggage they brought with them from their previous lives that made them what they were today.  Lacking this life experience, the characters in ""Brick,"" on the other hand, go through the motions, but always eliciting the nagging impression in us that they are merely playing dress-up (if not literally, at least metaphorically), a fact which drains the film itself of vitality and relevance.  To put it more bluntly and succinctly, we simply don't care.It doesn't help that the story itself is convoluted and not particularly compelling, or that the acting is stiff and deliberately one-note in nature (not the fault of the actors, I must add).  Moreover, it's rather inexplicable as to why this high school seems strangely bereft of teachers and classrooms.  On the positive side, Johnson and cinematographer Steve Yedlin do bring an appropriately stark and ominous look to the normally cheery, antiseptic Southern California suburban backdrop against which the drama takes place.Perhaps by the time they all get together for their 20th high school reunion, the characters will have grown into their roles.

Since I already used that title for a review, I didn't use it again for this review of Brick, but rest assured it fits.Brick, like Serenity, must have a serious cult following, because at the time of this writing both Brick and Serenity have an average of 4 stars and enough reviews to have led me to believe that the 4-star average ratings must have some credibility.So I tried Brick based on the 4-star average rating.Back at the beginning of the year I also tried Serenity based on the same premise: ""If it's got 4 stars it's got to be at least halfway decent, right?""

Apparently the common denominator for both Brick and Serenity are the abundance of teens and young adults that for whatever reason are captivated by the plethora of bad TV plaguing prime time that targets the teen through 24 demo.Brick is about high schoolers that all somehow have the dispositions, intelligence, vocabularies, mannerisms and lifestyles of no-personality 30+ year olds.

And even if you haven't, Rian Johnson's ""Brick"", an homage to classic film noirs, is well worth a look.While there's many parallels to Dashiell Hammett's ""The Maltese Falcon"" (even the item the title refers to is sort of a modern equivalent of the ""black bird""), as well as Raymond Chandler's mysteries and other stories of the genre, ""Brick"" has more than enough unique twists and turns of its own.  The story begins when anti-social reject Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) accepts a phone call from his ex-girlfriend (""Lost""'s Emilie deRavin).  She rambles off a series of slang terms and nicknames Brendan's never heard of.  Brendan immediately sets out to meet her face to face by infiltrating one social clique after another, starting by getting himself invited to a party hosted by a wealthy cheerleader and her jock boyfriend.  Two days later, Brendan discovers his ex's body.  He hides the body so he can bring the people behind her death to justice himself, at the same time making himself a suspect in her murder.Several of the classic noir hallmarks are there.  There's the well-informed sidekick (Matt O'Leary), the intimidating crime boss (college-aged drug-dealer ""The Pin"", played by Lukas Haas), his hired muscle (Noah Fleiss), the troublesome junkie (Noah Segan), the by-the-book authority figure (Richard ""John Shaft"" Roundtree) and not one but two drop-dead-gorgeous femme fatales, cheerleader Laura (Nora Zehetner) and drama club member Kara (Meagan Good).  The hero dishes abuse, takes abuse, and cracks wise like a Humphrey Bogart character.  But everyone delivers their lines (riddled with slang terms from the 30's, 40's, and 50's, as well as several invented by Johnson) and actions so casually and with such conviction that they seem natural and the movie never devolves into spoof.  And, like any good film noir, the movie stays gritty without ever being crass or in bad taste.  All this with just a dollop of high school angst in the mix.Nathan Johnson's score is one of the highlights of the film.  Like the movie, the score has an Indie feel, a contemporary feel, and a retro feel, all at once, with a hint of jazz.  Reoccuring character themes lend dramatic emphasis to the film.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance will make you forget all about the role he played in the comedy series ""3rd Rock from the Sun.""  But the true stand-out performance is by Nora Zehetner, who is glamorous in the best old-fashioned sense, and could definitely go places.",5,"""Lunch is Difficult""",1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,2577,"['Ever', 'wonder', 'what', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'set', 'high', 'school', 'Well', 'have', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'Brick', 'homage', 'classic', 'film', 'noirs', 'well', 'look.While', 'many', 'parallels', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'even', 'item', 'title', 'refers', 'sort', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'black', 'bird', 'as', 'well', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'mysteries', 'other', 'stories', 'genre', 'Brick', 'more', 'enough', 'unique', 'twists', 'turns', 'own', 'story', 'when', 'anti-social', 'reject', 'Brendan', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'phone', 'call', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Lost', 'Emilie', 'deRavin', 'series', 'slang', 'terms', 'nicknames', 'Brendan', 'never', 'heard', 'Brendan', 'immediately', 'out', 'meet', 'face', 'face', 'infiltrating', 'one', 'social', 'clique', 'starting', 'getting', 'invited', 'party', 'hosted', 'wealthy', 'cheerleader', 'jock', 'boyfriend', 'Two', 'days', 'later', 'Brendan', 'ex', 'body', 'body', 'can', 'bring', 'people', 'death', 'justice', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'suspect', 'murder.Several', 'classic', 'noir', 'hallmarks', 'are', 'there', 'well-informed', 'sidekick', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'intimidating', 'crime', 'boss', 'college-aged', 'drug-dealer', 'Pin', 'played', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'hired', 'muscle', 'Noah', 'Fleiss', 'troublesome', 'junkie', 'Noah', 'Segan', 'by-the-book', 'authority', 'figure', 'Richard', 'John', 'Shaft', 'Roundtree', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'drop-dead-gorgeous', 'femme', 'fatales', 'cheerleader', 'Laura', 'Nora', 'Zehetner', 'drama', 'club', 'member', 'Kara', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'hero', 'dishes', 'abuse', 'abuse', 'cracks', 'wise', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'character', 'everyone', 'delivers', 'lines', 'riddled', 'slang', 'terms', '30', '40', '50', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'invented', 'Johnson', 'actions', 'so', 'casually', 'such', 'conviction', 'seem', 'natural', 'movie', 'never', 'spoof', 'good', 'film', 'noir', 'movie', 'gritty', 'ever', 'being', 'crass', 'bad', 'taste', 'just', 'dollop', 'high', 'school', 'angst', 'mix.Nathan', 'Johnson', 'score', 'one', 'highlights', 'film', 'movie', 'score', 'Indie', 'feel', 'contemporary', 'feel', 'retro', 'feel', 'once', 'hint', 'jazz', 'Reoccuring', 'character', 'themes', 'lend', 'dramatic', 'emphasis', 'film', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'performance', 'will', 'make', 'forget', 'role', 'played', 'comedy', 'series', '3rd', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'true', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'Nora', 'Zehetner', 'who', 'glamorous', 'best', 'old-fashioned', 'sense', 'could', 'definitely', 'go', 'places']",N/A

173810,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,1417068329,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[4, 8]","Film noir has to be one of my favorite genres in the realm of story weaving. As a mixture of crime drama, mystery, German expressionism, thriller, melodrama and even a few drops of horror film noir has had a presence in cinema since the 1940s.  I do not proclaim myself a film noir expert per se, but I have seen plenty of films in this category to be a fair judge of what is good and what is not.  The best analogy I have for this film is being on a date with a woman who is beautiful and dripping with sex appeal yet has no depth or substance whatsoever.The 2005 film ""Brick"" would be considered a ""neo-noir"" film, mainly being a modern film noir omitting the ""black and white"" and some of the day old norms of the 1940s and 1950s. The plot revolves around Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a high school student who is trying to solve the disappearance/murder of his estranged girlfriend Emily.  Brendan jumps down an interesting ""rabbit hole"" and uncovers many layers in his quest to resolve this conundrum. The grapples or ""layers"" Brendan tackles consist, but are not limited to, drug dealers, police, murder, fights and the proverbial femme fatal.These all seem like prolific standards for a noir film, yet I found this film to be rather lacking in cohesiveness and believability. The movie is about high school students, not one single scene involves a classroom.  In addition, these high school students in many ways act more like adults.  Another odd aspect about these ""high school"" students is their dialect is a hybrid of adolescent jargon and an anachronistic tongue of an era long gone. I do appreciate the ode to classic noir by having our ""anti-hero"" calling a girl; excuse me dame ""angel"" but it seems odd to have a high school student doing this.  To piggy back this notion; there is a scene where ""The Pin"", a drug czar played by Lukas Haas, is having a meeting with his peers while his mother is serving snacks and drinks.  Perhaps this is black comedy but I found it totally preposterous.Another problem area with this film is the opening scene. Technically, the framing and cinematography are breathtaking, as is the score.  Brendan is standing in front of a storm drain looking at Emily, who appears to be dead.  Then the scene cuts stating ""two days prior"", I had the assumption that the opening of the film would also serve as the climax.  Sadly we the viewers are brought back to the storm drain scene within twenty minutes of the motion picture.  A perfect story set up ruined for the next ninety minutes seem bloated and expedited at the same time.Furthermore, there were way too many characters in this movie and the cant and code names made it difficult at times to keep up with the story. Perhaps I felt this way because a vast majority of the dialogue was mumbled in this movie. Once the climax came and we the viewers figure out ""who was behind it all"" I felt somewhat let down.  It was as if the ending was too standard for a film noir.On a positive note, the acting was very good. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a really fine job as our anti-hero; with the material he was given, as did Nora Zehetner.  The mood was also very stark and bare, great for a film noir. .  The lighting and cinematography was also on point.  As for the score, well let's just say I purchased it as soon as the end credits were rolling.  The problem with this movie was the direction of the story.  The story was not bad but the execution was very lazy and lacked focus, which translated to a very elongated viewing. I personally feel that if the high school angle was omitted and/or reworked, the story became a bit more simplified and the ending wasn't quite so trite this film could have been the standard all neo-noirs should live up to.",2,Wonderful qualities that sink....just like a brick,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,3746,"['Film', 'noir', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'genres', 'realm', 'story', 'weaving', 'mixture', 'crime', 'drama', 'mystery', 'German', 'expressionism', 'thriller', 'melodrama', 'even', 'few', 'drops', 'horror', 'film', 'noir', 'had', 'presence', 'cinema', '1940s', 'do', 'not', 'proclaim', 'film', 'noir', 'expert', 'se', 'have', 'seen', 'plenty', 'films', 'category', 'be', 'fair', 'judge', 'what', 'good', 'what', 'not', 'best', 'analogy', 'have', 'film', 'being', 'date', 'woman', 'who', 'beautiful', 'dripping', 'sex', 'appeal', 'yet', 'depth', 'substance', 'whatsoever.The', '2005', 'film', 'Brick', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'neo-noir', 'film', 'mainly', 'being', 'modern', 'film', 'noir', 'omitting', 'black', 'white', 'day', 'old', 'norms', '1940s', '1950s', 'plot', 'Brendan', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'trying', 'solve', 'disappearance/murder', 'estranged', 'girlfriend', 'Emily', 'Brendan', 'down', 'interesting', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'uncovers', 'many', 'layers', 'quest', 'resolve', 'conundrum', 'grapples', 'layers', 'Brendan', 'tackles', 'consist', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'drug', 'dealers', 'police', 'murder', 'fights', 'proverbial', 'femme', 'fatal.These', 'seem', 'prolific', 'standards', 'noir', 'film', 'yet', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'rather', 'lacking', 'cohesiveness', 'believability', 'movie', 'about', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'scene', 'classroom', 'addition', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'many', 'ways', 'act', 'more', 'like', 'adults', 'odd', 'aspect', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'dialect', 'hybrid', 'adolescent', 'jargon', 'anachronistic', 'tongue', 'era', 'long', 'gone', 'do', 'appreciate', 'ode', 'classic', 'noir', 'having', 'anti-hero', 'calling', 'girl', 'excuse', 'dame', 'angel', 'odd', 'have', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'doing', 'piggy', 'back', 'notion', 'scene', 'where', 'Pin', 'drug', 'czar', 'played', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'having', 'meeting', 'peers', 'mother', 'serving', 'snacks', 'drinks', 'Perhaps', 'black', 'comedy', 'found', 'totally', 'problem', 'area', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'Technically', 'framing', 'cinematography', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'score', 'Brendan', 'standing', 'front', 'storm', 'drain', 'looking', 'Emily', 'who', 'be', 'dead', 'Then', 'scene', 'cuts', 'stating', 'two', 'days', 'prior', 'had', 'assumption', 'opening', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'serve', 'climax', 'Sadly', 'viewers', 'are', 'brought', 'back', 'storm', 'drain', 'scene', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'motion', 'picture', 'perfect', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'ruined', 'next', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'seem', 'bloated', 'expedited', 'same', 'time.Furthermore', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'movie', 'cant', 'code', 'names', 'made', 'difficult', 'times', 'keep', 'up', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'felt', 'way', 'vast', 'majority', 'dialogue', 'was', 'mumbled', 'movie', 'climax', 'came', 'viewers', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'standard', 'film', 'positive', 'note', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'did', 'really', 'fine', 'job', 'anti-hero', 'material', 'was', 'given', 'did', 'Nora', 'Zehetner', 'mood', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'stark', 'bare', 'great', 'film', 'noir', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'point', 'score', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'purchased', 'as', 'soon', 'end', 'credits', 'were', 'rolling', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'direction', 'story', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'execution', 'was', 'very', 'lazy', 'lacked', 'focus', 'translated', 'very', 'elongated', 'viewing', 'personally', 'feel', 'high', 'school', 'angle', 'was', 'omitted', 'and/or', 'reworked', 'story', 'became', 'bit', 'more', 'simplified', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'trite', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'standard', 'neo-noirs', 'should', 'live', 'up']",N/A

173812,A2GJ98824GGXGP,1417068329,Timothy Kearney,"[5, 7]","I read a synopsis of BRICK in a local newspaper that was oversimplified at best. It basically said the film was about a murder of a high school student and her friend, the loner Brendan invades the high school cliques to find out what happened. It sounded like a Hardy Boys with a murder and edge film. My guess is that the person who wrote the capsulated summary didn't see the film and based the summary on another summary. It turns out that BRICK is a sophisticated murder mystery that does in fact involve a young woman in high school named Emily (Emilie De Raven), and her former boyfriend Brendan (Joseph Gordon Leavitt) searches for the answers. The search brings him into a world of drugs, murder, and treachery. This world includes two girls Laura and Kara, both of whom seem to want Brendan, the drug leader Pin (Lucas Haas), a slightly disabled adult who still lives with his mother, Tugger (Noah Fleiss), the Pin's henchman who longs to be in charge and Emily's last boyfriend an addict known as Dode (Noah Sagan).The film has a number of strengths. It is told exclusively through the point of view of Brendan and we never leave Brendan's world. We see things as he sees things and realize he's intelligent, perhaps more intelligent than most people realize. Even though it's not a typical high school world, we see the world from a high schooler's psychological perspective. The only difficulty is the plot is rather complex and there are so many characters, it can be hard to keep them straight. Fortunately the plot is compelling enough to maintain the viewer's interest so we wrestle with the complexities. It ends on a somewhat interesting note, but I'm not sure all viewers will believe everything we learn at the end.

173814,AV5G37VFE5NVD,1417068329,Tom Benton,"[2, 3]","Thinking about high school, it's odd that no ""high school noir"" films existed prior to the last few years.  High school is such a perfect setting for a film noir, and though it may seem ridiculous at first, there's many parallels between the world of a teenager and a character in a 1940s noir, be it the battle between the police and the shamuses and the battle between the administrators and the students or the shady meetings under bridges and the shady meetings in the parking lot after school.  In 2004, Rob Thomas' Chandler-esque take on high school hit UPN (and later the CW) as ""Veronica Mars,"" and one year later, ""Brick"" premiered at Sundance.While ""Veronica Mars"" is on the lighter side of noir, ""Brick"" is a pitch black, gritty piece which recalls Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep,"" with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.  The resemblance isn't in the style of director Rian Johnson (which bears a striking similarity to that used by David Lynch in one of his own neo-noir's, 1992's ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me""), but in the convoluted script, the conspicuous characters, and particularly the rapidfire, hard-boiled dialogue, delivered at a startling pace by a talented young cast.  This includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, best known as the youngest alien explorer from ""3rd Rock from the Sun,"" along with Emilie de Ravin of ""Lost,"" Lukas Haas, Noah Fleiss, and Richard Roundtree, the original ""Shaft.""  Gordon-Levitt's role is a far cry from his work on ""Third Rock.""  He's cool, quick-witted, and tough, something of a much more contemptuous Sam Spade.  Gordon-Levitt is truly excellent, and he shows real promise should he be cast in the right roles.  Haas and Fleiss both play their roles quite well, but it's Meagan Good as a scheming drama queen (literally) who commands the most attention.The film's plot, even at its barest, is quite clearly shaped in the noir mold: Gordon-Levitt's character, a high school student who keeps himself distanced from his classmates, thrusts himself into the cliques in an effort to find out who murdered his ex-girlfriend.  His search leads him to the Pin (Haas), a 26-year-old drug kingpin.  In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Gordon-Levitt meets with the Pin and his henchman in the kitchen, while the Pin's mother serves them breakfast and apple juice before kissing him goodbye.  It's the one scene in ""Brick"" where writer/director Johnson acknowledges that all our characters are kids, and that the film itself revolves around high school, despite its utterly somber tone.The rest of the movie is so relentlessly straight-faced and serious that you almost forget it's a film noir about high school.  It's classic noir, though.  The protagonist loner with a rocky exterior and a noble interior, looking to do the right thing; the suspicious, all-powerful, ominous villain, usually an obsese fifty-year-old businessman but in this case a twenty-something drug dealer living in his basement; the femme fatale, a beautiful seductress with a hidden agenda; even the flirtatious and manipulative female who usually is an actress or waitress or secretary, or something along those lines, but who here is the lead actress in the high school drama club.  Much of the film's charm comes from consideration of its many allegories to ""adult"" noir tales.The execution of this sort of idea matters so much, because, after all, what is a film noir if not cinema at its most stylish?  Johnson is well aware of this, though.  It shows not only in the maturity and seasoned approach of his directing, but also in the stimulating photography and, especially, in the stunning editing.  It comes as no surprise that the editing, also by Johnson, is so good, since Johnson began his career editing his short film ""Evil Demon Goofball from Hell!!!"" and then Lucky McKee's popular ""May.""  ""Brick"" would make an excellent sample film to show young editors, since Johnson - at 29, a young editor himself - has done such a spectacular job, fashioning a seamless flow of jump cuts, point-of-view shots, distorted lenses, and exposed film.  Supporting this is an inventive, unorthodox score by Nathan Johnson, comprised of some sort of naiive bells and the woeful trumpet which Jerry Goldsmith used in his music for ""Chinatown"" and ""L.A. Confidential.""It's a pity that ""Brick"" didn't get more notice.  It was unquestionably one of the best films of 2005.  I'd even go so far as to call it one of the top films I've ever seen.  Viewed as a film from an experienced director, it's a stellar film, but when viewed as Johnson's debut, it's a fantastic achievement.  Fortunately, Johnson seems to have received the attention he deserved from this film: his next project stars big-name actors like Rachel Weisz and Adrien Brody.  I really hope Gordon-Levitt gets some decent roles, because he proves his acting prowess here.  It's films with the originality and effort of ""Brick"" that keep the industry going, and if you haven't seen it, don't hesitate to leap up and hunt for it like Sam Spade for the maltese falcon.",5,A

Brendan, hard-boiled-type, Bogart-like high school student, is determined to find out the truths behind the death of his former girl-friend, and with a help from bespectacled buddy (Matt O'Leary), he confronts the thugs with knife and gun, and a grinning drug lord (Lucas Haas) while fending off the threat from the authorities ... not the police, but the vice-principal of the school.This detective-story-in-high-school premise could have been a very bad joke with another director, but in fact the results are much better than you expect with strong acting of the cast, especially from Joseph Gordon-Levitt as hard-nosed Brendan, and sure-handed direction from Rian Johnson. It takes a while to get accustomed to the rhythm and mood of the film, and lots of slang too, but once you do, you find the film surprisingly engaging with the story of complicated mystery among a web of these eccentric characters.Still I was a little disappointed with the film's female characters. There is no chemistry or sexual tension between Brendan and other female characters, especially with Laura played by Nora Zehetner in Chinese dress, and beautiful as she is, she is no Mary Astor. This kind of story needs a femme fatale, but how can you find a Barbara Stanwyck wearing an anklet in today's high school?""Brick"" is perhaps a love-or-hate film with its bleak mood and dry humor.

After they broke up, Emily started ""eating lunch"" with a more popular, yet mysterious crowd (""The Upper-Crust"").  As he delves into their world, he finds a sickening subculture of drugs, double-crosses, and worse.The movie is set in Orange County (San Clemente), and the movie's big hook is that it's an update of those terrific film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s.  Yes, the movie sometimes comes across as ""The O.C."" mixed with ""The Lady from Shanghai,"" with just a touch of ""Blue Velvet.""  However, as such, ""Brick"" succeeds very well.  The dialogue is full of clever pithy lines and slang that went out with Eisenhower (Beautiful woman: Do you trust me now?  Brendan: Less than when I didn't trust you before.).  The directing is also terrific - kudos to first time director Rian Johnson.  Finally, Jospeh Gordon-Levitt makes a likeable protagonist amidst the crazy proceedings and characters, including a rather magnetic Lukas Haas as ""The Pin.""Although making the film in noir style is essentially a stunt, the tone helps make the movie deeper, more satisfying - easily one of the most intricate teen dramas ever made.  The plot is full of holes (what film noir isn't?), but the noir style and look smoothes out the rough edges; yes, style does sometimes trump content.  There were a few times when the ""Brick"" verged on being a typical teen movie; fortunately, Johnson manages to get back on track.  Highly recommended for fans of film noir or sophisticated teen dramas.",5,"""Come to see the show?""",1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,1588,"['Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'stars', 'Brick', 'Brendan', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'searching', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Emily', 'broke', 'up', 'Emily', 'started', 'eating', 'lunch', 'more', 'popular', 'yet', 'mysterious', 'crowd', 'Upper-Crust', 'world', 'sickening', 'subculture', 'drugs', 'double-crosses', 'worse.The', 'movie', 'set', 'Orange', 'County', 'San', 'Clemente', 'movie', 'big', 'hook', 'update', 'terrific', 'film', 'noirs', '1940s', '1950s', 'Yes', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'O.C', 'mixed', 'Lady', 'Shanghai', 'just', 'touch', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'However', 'such', 'Brick', 'very', 'well', 'dialogue', 'full', 'clever', 'pithy', 'lines', 'slang', 'went', 'out', 'Eisenhower', 'Beautiful', 'woman', 'Do', 'trust', 'now', 'Brendan', 'Less', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'before.', 'directing', 'also', 'terrific', 'kudos', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'Finally', 'Jospeh', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'likeable', 'protagonist', 'crazy', 'proceedings', 'characters', 'including', 'rather', 'magnetic', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'Pin', 'making', 'film', 'noir', 'style', 'essentially', 'stunt', 'tone', 'make', 'movie', 'deeper', 'more', 'satisfying', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'intricate', 'teen', 'dramas', 'ever', 'made', 'plot', 'full', 'holes', 'what', 'film', 'noir', ""n't"", 'noir', 'style', 'look', 'smoothes', 'out', 'rough', 'edges', 'yes', 'style', 'sometimes', 'trump', 'content', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'Brick', 'verged', 'being', 'typical', 'teen', 'movie', 'fortunately', 'Johnson', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'film', 'noir', 'sophisticated', 'teen', 'dramas']",N/A

But, this little film about jaded southern california high school students and their heroin addictions really caught me off gaurd.  Yes, there is action and violence, but the movie has a very intricate dialouge to follow, many words. At times i felt they were reading out of a book.  And the little slams and quirky language that they use, I just don't envision people naturally just being able to play off each other so spontaniously with insults etc, giving this movie and almost short story feel to it.  I felt like I was reading a story, and the pictures were playing the images out for me.  Very unique way of presenting a film, I believe pulled of nicely, with some great camera work as well.  A great independent film, if you like the Movie Kids, Requium for a Dream, or Spun, than this movie might interest you to see.

For the fan of film noir, this movie's archetypical charaters, dialogue, and pace will be familiar.  Sometimes it may seem too over-the-top, but I saw this as being part of the parody.  There's some negative reviews out there, and that's fine, but from a few that I read, it seems as though a lot of people weren't aware of the parodic stance of the film.I will give this warning out to people who have yet to see ""Brick"": you cannot be a passive viewer.  The dialogue is fast and littered with jive, the story takes a lot of turns, and the story has a pretty quick tempo.  If you wait for it to come to you, you'll be left in the cold.I feel slighted that this movie came and went and I did not know about it until the other day.

173820,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,1417068329,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[2, 2]","Brick is a bit surreal, a bit noir, and a bit high school drama. The only reason it's high school drama is because the story is played out with high school kids. What makes the film interesting and gives it its twist, is that the story feels as if it was written for a cast in their thirties.If Brick had played out with a more age-appropriate cast, though, it would have been more of a cliche whodunit mystery-drama. Instead, it plays out in an interestingly unique way. The audience is asked to accept the situation as reality, while at the same time being presented with the conflicting message of incongruity between the actions and the storyline. Instead of hindering the film, this actually makes it better.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, although arguably miscast as the hardnosed detective type, plays his nonchalant protagonist with so much temperamental angst and passive strength that he almost pulls it off, despite his fragile bookish look. He's still a strong actor and helps carry the film's emotional core.The story itself sometimes feels a little contrived, but it's at those times that you have to remember that these are high school kids involved in over-the-top noirish detective drama. The school principal substitutes for the tough cop looking for a scapegoat, but willing to make a deal with the detective. The school jock for the loud mouth tough guy who's not really as deep into the game as he'd like people to believe. Each character substitution for the classic detective story is here, and each one is well played.The film wraps up cleanly and leaves the viewer satisfied. The DVD is lacking in extras, and for some reason they include the audition tape of the female lead, even though she's the weakest of the lot, and her audition tape just goes to prove that she didn't improve much from day one. Brick is definitely worth checking out, though.",4,"Drugs, guns, and money... and tough high school kids?",1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,1866,"['Brick', 'bit', 'surreal', 'bit', 'noir', 'bit', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'only', 'reason', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'story', 'played', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'What', 'film', 'interesting', 'twist', 'story', 'feels', 'was', 'written', 'cast', 'thirties.If', 'Brick', 'had', 'played', 'out', 'more', 'age-appropriate', 'cast', 'though', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'cliche', 'whodunit', 'mystery-drama', 'Instead', 'out', 'interestingly', 'unique', 'way', 'audience', 'asked', 'accept', 'situation', 'reality', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'presented', 'conflicting', 'message', 'incongruity', 'actions', 'storyline', 'Instead', 'hindering', 'film', 'actually', 'better.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'arguably', 'miscast', 'hardnosed', 'detective', 'type', 'nonchalant', 'protagonist', 'so', 'much', 'temperamental', 'angst', 'passive', 'strength', 'almost', 'off', 'fragile', 'bookish', 'look', 'still', 'strong', 'actor', 'carry', 'film', 'emotional', 'core.The', 'story', 'sometimes', 'little', 'contrived', 'times', 'have', 'remember', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'involved', 'over-the-top', 'noirish', 'detective', 'drama', 'school', 'principal', 'substitutes', 'tough', 'cop', 'looking', 'scapegoat', 'willing', 'make', 'deal', 'detective', 'school', 'jock', 'loud', 'mouth', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'not', 'really', 'deep', 'game', ""'d"", 'like', 'people', 'believe', 'character', 'substitution', 'classic', 'detective', 'story', 'here', 'one', 'well', 'played.The', 'film', 'up', 'cleanly', 'viewer', 'satisfied', 'DVD', 'lacking', 'extras', 'reason', 'include', 'audition', 'tape', 'female', 'lead', 'even', 'weakest', 'lot', 'audition', 'tape', 'just', 'prove', 'did', ""n't"", 'improve', 'much', 'day', 'one', 'Brick', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'though']",N/A
