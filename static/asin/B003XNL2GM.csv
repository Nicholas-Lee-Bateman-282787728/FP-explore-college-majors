I should have known, from the cast, it was going to be another winner from YA Entertainment. I decided to buy it as the price came down quite a bit. I am trying to buy as many Ya series as I can. I am so sorry about them closing the company, but hopefully all these wonderful actors and behind the scenes people will be available from other studios. I think some of these stars are now with King Kong studios. This is a great love story and political exposure. It gave a little behind the scenes look inot what politics in Korea is like. As is the case here too money and power go hand in hand and the little guy gets abused or forgotten. The stars are top Korean actors, My Lovely Sam-soon, Scent of a Woman and Greatest Love are other dramas with some of the leading stars. Cha Seung Won and Kim Sun Ah are really great together. He is becoming my number one favorite as he has some really great moves and a great face which shows so much expression...he is really wonderful with his co-stars. Now she is just as flexible an actress as I have ever seen. She really puts herself into her performance. I look forward to seeing these stars together again in the future I hope. They really look great together. Thanks Amazon for offering a good selection and having great service.",5,Well worth the wait,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,1351,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'become', 'interested', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'cast', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'winner', 'YA', 'Entertainment', 'decided', 'buy', 'price', 'came', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'am', 'trying', 'buy', 'many', 'Ya', 'series', 'can', 'am', 'so', 'sorry', 'closing', 'company', 'hopefully', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'scenes', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'other', 'studios', 'think', 'stars', 'are', 'now', 'King', 'Kong', 'studios', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'political', 'exposure', 'gave', 'little', 'scenes', 'look', 'inot', 'what', 'politics', 'Korea', 'like', 'case', 'here', 'too', 'money', 'power', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'little', 'guy', 'abused', 'forgotten', 'stars', 'are', 'top', 'Korean', 'actors', 'My', 'Lovely', 'Sam-soon', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Greatest', 'Love', 'are', 'other', 'dramas', 'leading', 'stars', 'Cha', 'Seung', 'Won', 'Kim', 'Sun', 'Ah', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'together', 'becoming', 'number', 'one', 'favorite', 'really', 'great', 'moves', 'great', 'face', 'so', 'much', 'expression', 'really', 'wonderful', 'co-stars', 'Now', 'just', 'flexible', 'actress', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'really', 'performance', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'stars', 'together', 'again', 'future', 'hope', 'really', 'look', 'great', 'together', 'Thanks', 'Amazon', 'offering', 'good', 'selection', 'having', 'great', 'service']",N/A
1371029,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B003XNL2GM,Anne-Marie G,"[1, 1]","I dragged my feet about watching this drama because the description really didn't move me.So glad I finally did watch it, such well crafted and engaging storytelling. Absolutely one of the best Korean dramas I have seen.Kim Sun Ah (probably best known as Kim Sam Soon inMy Lovely Sam-Soon)plays Shin Mi Rae, who is basically the coffee girl at City Hall, she hasn't been promoted in the seven years she has been working there. She is well known for a few things: making great coffee, never choosing a side in an argument, being a doormat and rather poor personal hygiene. It is a little embarrassing to watch the first few episodes of City Hall, just because of how awkward Shin Mi Rae is. Its well worth it, and it is important in establishing who Shin Mi Rae is and who she becomes.Cha Seung Won (who I know as Dokko Jin inThe Greatest Love - Korean Drama (6 DVD) All Region with English Subtitles) plays Jo Gook, an up and coming politician, who is being groomed for success by B.B. the political mastermind in Korea, who put the most recent president in the Blue House. His character is a little ruthless in getting what he wants and doesn't understand why B.B. has sent him to Mi Rae's rural city of Inju when he could have had a far more prestigious position.Through the course of the drama these two end up changing each other, for the best. She goes from essentially a useless wallflower to a political powerhouse who will do whatever she can to protect her city of Inju. He goes from being a man who only has dreams of success--but without and grounding or substance behind those dreams, to wanting to protect her dreams and really understand what it means to be a public servant.That does sound a little like a turn off, doesn't it?It isn't though. This drama is zippy and both of these actors have such a great way of delivering their dialogue, its just like watching a tennis match when they are interacting, their chemistry is phenomenal. Even though both of them are better know for other roles, I far more prefer this drama over their name makers.This drama does a great job of creating the political world that the characters have to live in--which is fascinating in a real world sense, as well. Korea's democracy is something the country is having to grow into--and it is reflected in this drama. The old traditional ways of doing things clash with the laws of living in a democratic state.On an aesthetic level, the costumes in this drama are spot on.  Cha Seung Won has another career as a model, and it shows. His six foot two frame is forever being dressed in three piece suits, adding a real air of suaveness to his politician character.  Kim Sun Ah goes from being dressed in off the rack business frump to light and airy business casual outfits that make me wish I had the key to her closet.Additionally, the music in this drama is absolutely spot on. There are a few songs that play which work really well as emotional  cues for various scenes.The supporting cast of characters is just as strong, many of them having their own narrative arcs and growth spurts, all of their actors being just as spot on.What is even better about this drama, is that not only is it strong for the 19 episodes leading up to the finale, but that the 20th episode is just as strong. Korean dramas seem to struggle with wrapping things up in a really strong manner, more often than not the shows end with a bit of a whimper, which is unfortunate. In City Hall the tension remain with the show until the end, the narrative still had important things to say before the final few minutes and it really pulled the whole show to a meaningful close.Absolutely worth your time.",5,One of the Best Korean Dramas Out there!,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,3673,"['dragged', 'feet', 'watching', 'drama', 'description', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'me.So', 'glad', 'finally', 'did', 'watch', 'such', 'well', 'crafted', 'engaging', 'storytelling', 'Absolutely', 'one', 'best', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'have', 'seen.Kim', 'Sun', 'Ah', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'Kim', 'Sam', 'Soon', 'inMy', 'Lovely', 'Sam-Soon', 'Shin', 'Mi', 'Rae', 'who', 'basically', 'coffee', 'girl', 'City', 'Hall', ""n't"", 'been', 'promoted', 'seven', 'years', 'been', 'working', 'there', 'well', 'known', 'few', 'things', 'making', 'great', 'coffee', 'never', 'choosing', 'side', 'argument', 'being', 'doormat', 'rather', 'poor', 'personal', 'hygiene', 'little', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'City', 'Hall', 'just', 'how', 'awkward', 'Shin', 'Mi', 'Rae', 'well', 'important', 'establishing', 'who', 'Shin', 'Mi', 'Rae', 'who', 'becomes.Cha', 'Seung', 'Won', 'who', 'know', 'Dokko', 'Jin', 'inThe', 'Greatest', 'Love', 'Korean', 'Drama', '6', 'DVD', 'Region', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'Jo', 'Gook', 'up', 'coming', 'politician', 'who', 'being', 'groomed', 'success', 'B.B', 'political', 'mastermind', 'Korea', 'who', 'put', 'most', 'recent', 'president', 'Blue', 'House', 'character', 'little', 'ruthless', 'getting', 'what', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'B.B', 'sent', 'Mi', 'Rae', 'rural', 'city', 'Inju', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'far', 'more', 'prestigious', 'course', 'drama', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'changing', 'other', 'best', 'essentially', 'useless', 'wallflower', 'political', 'powerhouse', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'can', 'protect', 'city', 'Inju', 'being', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'dreams', 'success', 'grounding', 'substance', 'dreams', 'wanting', 'protect', 'dreams', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'be', 'public', 'servant.That', 'sound', 'little', 'turn', 'off', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'though', 'drama', 'zippy', 'actors', 'have', 'such', 'great', 'way', 'delivering', 'dialogue', 'just', 'watching', 'tennis', 'match', 'when', 'are', 'interacting', 'chemistry', 'phenomenal', 'Even', 'are', 'better', 'know', 'other', 'roles', 'far', 'more', 'prefer', 'drama', 'name', 'makers.This', 'drama', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'political', 'world', 'characters', 'have', 'live', 'fascinating', 'real', 'world', 'sense', 'as', 'well', 'Korea', 'democracy', 'something', 'country', 'having', 'grow', 'reflected', 'drama', 'old', 'traditional', 'ways', 'doing', 'things', 'clash', 'laws', 'living', 'democratic', 'state.On', 'aesthetic', 'level', 'costumes', 'drama', 'are', 'spot', 'Cha', 'Seung', 'Won', 'career', 'model', 'six', 'foot', 'two', 'frame', 'forever', 'being', 'dressed', 'three', 'piece', 'suits', 'adding', 'real', 'air', 'suaveness', 'politician', 'character', 'Kim', 'Sun', 'Ah', 'being', 'dressed', 'off', 'rack', 'business', 'frump', 'light', 'airy', 'business', 'casual', 'make', 'wish', 'had', 'key', 'closet.Additionally', 'music', 'drama', 'absolutely', 'spot', 'are', 'few', 'songs', 'play', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'emotional', 'cues', 'various', 'scenes.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'just', 'strong', 'many', 'having', 'own', 'narrative', 'arcs', 'growth', 'spurts', 'actors', 'being', 'just', 'spot', 'on.What', 'even', 'better', 'drama', 'not', 'only', 'strong', '19', 'episodes', 'leading', 'up', 'finale', '20th', 'episode', 'just', 'strong', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'seem', 'struggle', 'wrapping', 'things', 'up', 'really', 'strong', 'manner', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'shows', 'end', 'bit', 'whimper', 'unfortunate', 'City', 'Hall', 'tension', 'remain', 'show', 'end', 'narrative', 'still', 'had', 'important', 'things', 'say', 'final', 'few', 'minutes', 'really', 'pulled', 'whole', 'show', 'meaningful', 'close.Absolutely', 'time']",N/A

It's about what happened when you mix love and politics. This show has it all: romance, comedy, drama, suspense, eye candy, intelectual stimulation and good music. It's so funny!!

It has a pretty intricate political plot that definitely held my attention more than the romance. I couldn't really feel the chemistry between the two main characters. However, the glimpse (dramatized of course) into local Korean politics was fascinating. I was surprised several times by plot twists, which is somewhat unusual for a kdrama. It was also hilarious, more so than Sam-soon.",4,"Great Politics, Okay Romance",1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,515,"['bought', 'City', 'Hall', 'love', 'actress', 'My', 'Lovely', 'Sam-Soon', 'City', 'Hall', 'totally', 'different', 'Lovely', 'Sam-Soon', 'pretty', 'intricate', 'political', 'plot', 'definitely', 'held', 'attention', 'more', 'romance', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'chemistry', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'However', 'glimpse', 'dramatized', 'course', 'local', 'Korean', 'politics', 'was', 'fascinating', 'was', 'surprised', 'several', 'times', 'plot', 'twists', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'kdrama', 'was', 'also', 'hilarious', 'more', 'so', 'Sam-soon']",N/A
