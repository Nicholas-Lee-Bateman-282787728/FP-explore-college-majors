However, it is not as quality material as the book. The performances are good and the plot moves along well. DO NOT be put off by Leonard Maltin's quote about the movie being &quot;draggy&quot;. It moves along at a good pace and he has just missed the point. Of course we must rememebr that many reviewers put movies without messages (like Pulp Fiction) on their all time greatest lists.

This telling of the story, however, is somewhat lacking, plus the DVD quality is only fair to poor.First of all, the film (what would I want to know about the film if I'd never watched it?):1) I'm writing this review under the assumption that you already know that this film is based on actual events chronicled in Corrie Ten Boom's fantastic book ""The Hiding Place.""  If you don't already know the storyline, please check out the book's description at the following link -The Hiding Place (Hendrickson Classic Biographies)2) Film pacing: Frankly this film was beyond slow, it was plodding.  At nearly 2.5 hrs long, it was just too long for the story it told.  And, it's not that I don't like long movies, because when there is enough content to demand the time, I'm willing to invest.  I'm convinced, though, that this film and the way it was tackled could and perhaps should have fit into a 90 min time frame.  Like I mentioned before, I think this film is based on one of the finest stories of resistance, edurance, and faith that came out of WWII, and while the movie depicted aspects of that, it was just too long.3) I realize that this film was released originally in 1975, and the effects reflect that.  This film plays like a made-for-TV movie.What about the quality of the DVD?1) The image quality looks like a VHS to DVD transfer.  There was apparently no remastering, etc., for this DVD release.2) The video quality ranged from merely acceptable to poor.  During darkened scenes, and there are plenty of them (most of the movie in fact - inside dimly lit rooms, at night, or in prisons) the video quality is so poor that the image comes close to being completely lost in the dark background many times.3) The filming is only so-so.The message:1) The basic message of faith and commitment comes through loud and clear, and is the strength of the story and of the movie.2) I didn't find it this way, but I could see this film coming across mainly as ""preachy"" to some people.The highlight:The best part in my opinion was when, at the end of the film, there is a segment that includes footge of Corrie Ten Boom herself in which she shares some comments with the viewers.All in all, an absolutely outstanding book, but a disappointing dramatization.3 stars (and a bit generous at that)",3,"""It's OK""...don't get me wrong...read on...",1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,2402,"['FANTASTIC', 'STORY', 'book', 'absolutely', 'top-notch', 'recommend', 'book', 'heistation', 'telling', 'story', 'however', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'DVD', 'quality', 'only', 'fair', 'poor.First', 'film', 'what', 'would', 'want', 'know', 'film', ""'d"", 'never', 'watched', ':1', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'assumption', 'already', 'know', 'film', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'chronicled', 'Corrie', 'Ten', 'Boom', 'fantastic', 'book', 'Hiding', 'Place', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'storyline', 'please', 'check', 'out', 'book', 'description', 'following', 'link', '-The', 'Hiding', 'Place', 'Hendrickson', 'Classic', 'Biographies', '2', 'Film', 'pacing', 'Frankly', 'film', 'was', 'slow', 'was', 'plodding', 'nearly', '2.5', 'hrs', 'long', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'story', 'told', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'long', 'movies', 'when', 'enough', 'content', 'demand', 'time', ""'m"", 'willing', 'invest', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'though', 'film', 'way', 'was', 'tackled', 'could', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'fit', '90', 'min', 'time', 'frame', 'mentioned', 'think', 'film', 'based', 'one', 'finest', 'stories', 'resistance', 'edurance', 'faith', 'came', 'WWII', 'movie', 'depicted', 'aspects', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'long.3', 'realize', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'originally', '1975', 'effects', 'reflect', 'film', 'made-for-TV', 'movie.What', 'quality', 'DVD', '1', 'image', 'quality', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'apparently', 'remastering', 'etc.', 'DVD', 'release.2', 'video', 'quality', 'ranged', 'merely', 'acceptable', 'poor', 'darkened', 'scenes', 'are', 'plenty', 'most', 'movie', 'fact', 'dimly', 'lit', 'rooms', 'night', 'prisons', 'video', 'quality', 'so', 'poor', 'image', 'close', 'being', 'completely', 'lost', 'dark', 'background', 'many', 'times.3', 'filming', 'only', 'so-so.The', 'message:1', 'basic', 'message', 'faith', 'commitment', 'loud', 'clear', 'strength', 'story', 'movie.2', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'could', 'see', 'film', 'coming', 'across', 'mainly', 'preachy', 'people.The', 'highlight', 'best', 'part', 'opinion', 'was', 'when', 'end', 'film', 'segment', 'footge', 'Corrie', 'Ten', 'Boom', 'shares', 'comments', 'viewers.All', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'book', 'disappointing', 'dramatization.3', 'stars', 'bit', 'generous']",N/A

Corrie Ten Boom, her father, and her sister were law-abiding Christians before Hitler took over the Netherlands.  As the horrors of the Nazi occupation mounted, the family made a moral choice to follow God's laws and to protect and hide the Jews that were being rounded up.  Living by faith, and depending on God's protection, they were able to save the lives of the Jewish people hiding in their home, even though they were betrayed by a Dutch informer and imprisoned.  What follows is a nightmare where the family is separated and then the two sisters are sent to a Nazi concentration camp.  Without giving away too much of the story, we see that God's hand is upholding them even throughout the worst miseries.  Corrie's sister Betsie is very frail physically, but a giant in faith.  She helps Corrie by encouraging her and giving her spiritual strength, while Corrie helps her sister to endure the harsh camp surroundings.  Both are indeed ""set free"" before the New Year's, and Corrie carries her family's legacies on to tell the world that there is no pit so deep that God's hand is not there to uphold you (Betsie's quote that keeps Corrie going).Watch the movie, read the book.

This is not correct.  I own the Wesscott DVD and it is both remastered and in widescreen.  It also comes with a 2nd DVD of great bonus material including a 1-hour ""behind the scenes"" extra, which despite its name is really mostly additional backstory to the events shown in the movie (which even uses numerous scenes that were not in the actual film), as well as several shows that were done with Corrie in her later years that are really neat to see (she was an interesting lady that clearly loved the Lord).  I recommend this version over the Billy Graham DVD release and especially over the VHS.  The remastering was fairly decent for such an old film too.  Just to clear up any confusion, the UPC # of the Wesscott DVD I have is 731635002106.As for the movie itself:Produced in 1975, this is a GREAT movie that is well worth a watch. This movie showcases in clear visual terms what it means to put your Christian faith into action and to trust God even when times look very very dark.If you don't know Corrie ten Boom's story, it is one not to miss and this movie is an excellent place to start. I don't want to give away too much from the movie, but Corrie's faith (and indeed the entire family's faith) is certainly tested in very significant ways. I think most of us, even though we know that horrible horrible things happened at the hand of the Nazis, find it easy to forget just how horribly evil that evil can be. This film, though definitely sanitized, once again reminds us of the evil that lurks within men's hearts (often behind-the-scenes, just waiting for an opportunity to burst out). For those with children, you do need to know that this is an intense film due to its subject matter and deaths do occur in the movie. I would say probably 11/12ish is probably the youngest appropriate age. There's plenty of great family discussion topics that can be gleaned from this movie.Like a number of other Christian movies, this movie does have a reasonably strong undercurrent that whatever God allows in our lives must be His will for us (because the logic dictates that if it wasn't His will, He wouldn't allow it to happen). I'm much less inclined towards that view these days as I see a distinction between God allowing something (i.e. not stepping in to change what humans or the devil is doing) and God's actual desire for us. I believe God can WANT *NO* Nazi concentration camps with hurt and suffering (i.e. that be His will) and yet, allow the course of events to play out. If God always interceded in our affairs according to His will, it would be Heaven on Earth now and our choices as humans would be of no effect. There's definitely a mystery to it all. But this movie, mirroring the thoughts of many Christians, does have that undercurrent that if we experience pain and suffering, then it must be because God wants us to experience it. With that said, this movie does showcase what tough faith looks like even when you don't understand the ""why"" and ultimately we see how God uses all that happened even to reach many through the telling of Corrie's story.This is definitely a worthwhile movie.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians dot org",5,Make sure you get the right DVD!,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,3323,"['reason', 'Amazon', 'show', 'VHS', 'picture', 'incorrectly', 'list', '1.33:1', 'non-widescreen', 'WESSCOTT', 'MARKETING', 'DVD', 'not', 'correct', 'own', 'Wesscott', 'DVD', 'remastered', 'widescreen', 'also', '2nd', 'DVD', 'great', 'bonus', 'material', 'including', '1-hour', 'scenes', 'extra', 'name', 'really', 'mostly', 'additional', 'backstory', 'events', 'shown', 'movie', 'even', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'actual', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'shows', 'were', 'done', 'Corrie', 'later', 'years', 'are', 'really', 'neat', 'see', 'was', 'interesting', 'lady', 'clearly', 'loved', 'Lord', 'recommend', 'version', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'DVD', 'release', 'especially', 'VHS', 'remastering', 'was', 'fairly', 'decent', 'such', 'old', 'film', 'too', 'Just', 'clear', 'up', 'confusion', 'UPC', 'Wesscott', 'DVD', 'have', '731635002106.As', 'movie', 'Produced', '1975', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'movie', 'clear', 'visual', 'terms', 'what', 'put', 'Christian', 'faith', 'action', 'trust', 'God', 'even', 'when', 'times', 'look', 'very', 'very', 'dark.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Corrie', 'ten', 'Boom', 'story', 'one', 'not', 'miss', 'movie', 'excellent', 'place', 'start', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'Corrie', 'faith', 'indeed', 'entire', 'family', 'faith', 'certainly', 'tested', 'very', 'significant', 'ways', 'think', 'most', 'even', 'know', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'things', 'happened', 'hand', 'Nazis', 'find', 'easy', 'forget', 'just', 'how', 'horribly', 'evil', 'can', 'be', 'film', 'definitely', 'sanitized', 'once', 'again', 'evil', 'men', 'hearts', 'often', 'behind-the-scenes', 'just', 'waiting', 'opportunity', 'burst', 'out', 'children', 'do', 'need', 'know', 'intense', 'film', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'deaths', 'do', 'occur', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'probably', '11/12ish', 'probably', 'youngest', 'appropriate', 'age', 'plenty', 'great', 'family', 'discussion', 'topics', 'can', 'be', 'gleaned', 'movie.Like', 'number', 'other', 'Christian', 'movies', 'movie', 'have', 'reasonably', 'strong', 'undercurrent', 'God', 'lives', 'must', 'be', 'will', 'logic', 'dictates', 'was', ""n't"", 'will', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'happen', ""'m"", 'much', 'less', 'inclined', 'towards', 'view', 'days', 'see', 'distinction', 'God', 'allowing', 'something', 'i.e', 'not', 'stepping', 'change', 'what', 'devil', 'doing', 'God', 'actual', 'desire', 'believe', 'God', 'can', 'WANT', '*NO*', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camps', 'hurt', 'suffering', 'i.e', 'be', 'will', 'yet', 'course', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'God', 'always', 'interceded', 'affairs', 'according', 'will', 'would', 'be', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'now', 'choices', 'humans', 'would', 'be', 'effect', 'definitely', 'mystery', 'movie', 'mirroring', 'thoughts', 'many', 'Christians', 'have', 'undercurrent', 'experience', 'pain', 'suffering', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'God', 'experience', 'said', 'movie', 'showcase', 'what', 'tough', 'faith', 'looks', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'ultimately', 'see', 'how', 'God', 'happened', 'even', 'reach', 'many', 'telling', 'Corrie', 'story.This', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'movie.Chris', 'LongMoviesForChristians', 'Movie', 'Reviewsmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",N/A

I couldn't believe how accurately done the Hiding Place was done based over Corrie Ten Boom's famous book. I've read the book which is an amazing book. I'm not sure how I could possibly choose between the two because both are so good. Both symbolize christianism in the best ways, one through the thoughts of Corrie, and the other through her actions. In all that she went through losing all her family except her nephew, Peter, she still found the love to find Christ through it all, as all of us will someday.When the Nazi's ruled by Adolf Hitler takes over the Netherlands, things are even worse then they seem at first. Queen Wilhelmina runs away to England, Jews are only allowed out at certain times, and in certain places, and things do not look good for Jewish businesses. Casper Ten Boom (Aurthur O' Connell), his daughters, his son, and his Grandson, of Haarlem, Holland, don't want to just sit around and do nothing, so they take action. In hopes he'll make a difference, Casper Ten Boom wears a yellow star in spite of his Christian faith. Corrie and Betsie (Jeannette Clift, and Julie Harris) help several people by dressing them up as women, and taking them to the country, and Kik and Peter (their nephews) even help to build a make shift hiding place for Jewish people in hiding for an underground. As these many things will help save several Jewish people, the Ten Boom family, assumed to be hiding Jews, but never proved, is sent off to Ravensbruck. Corrie and Betsie must keep up their faith in God in this prison, or lose everything in the hopes of surviving.The acting in the movie was impeccable. As the one and only movie Jeannette Clift ever did, she was amazing. She preferred acting on the stage more, but in one role, you can touch so many and in her amazing first time acting, and she acted (no pun intended) as if it were her first. Julie Harris from many films such as the original Haunting comes back to many who may find her familiar. She just a little bit older.In the aspect of showing the Christian and Jewish religions together, it shows how many people can act around us as if they are, and turn into the demons of satan in the process. It brings to light the fact that nowadays as things get even worse, and we live in more fear, no telling who is telling the truth and who is lying. To think they thought Hitler was the antichrist back then. It would've been believable had he gotten everyone under his wing. But he didn't and thank God.The whole movie makes you want to think it was just a movie, but it wasn't, it all happened. It shows you just how much people will do for others, and to put their own life on the line to do it. The Ten Booms family story is only one of the many stories out there, but one of the many that has inspired so many to give their lives to Christ, and help many others in need. 5 stars for perfect everything.",5,Hope and Love,1072396800,"12 26, 2003",2003,2966,"['Ten', 'Boom', 'family', 'survive', 'war', 'raging', 'Europe', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'accurately', 'done', 'Hiding', 'Place', 'was', 'done', 'based', 'Corrie', 'Ten', 'Boom', 'famous', 'book', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'amazing', 'book', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'choose', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'symbolize', 'christianism', 'best', 'ways', 'one', 'thoughts', 'Corrie', 'other', 'actions', 'went', 'losing', 'family', 'nephew', 'Peter', 'still', 'found', 'love', 'find', 'Christ', 'will', 'someday.When', 'Nazi', 'ruled', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'Netherlands', 'things', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'then', 'seem', 'first', 'Queen', 'Wilhelmina', 'away', 'England', 'Jews', 'are', 'only', 'allowed', 'out', 'certain', 'times', 'certain', 'places', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'good', 'Jewish', 'businesses', 'Casper', 'Ten', 'Boom', 'Aurthur', 'O', 'Connell', 'daughters', 'son', 'Grandson', 'Haarlem', 'Holland', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'just', 'sit', 'around', 'do', 'nothing', 'take', 'action', 'hopes', ""'ll"", 'make', 'difference', 'Casper', 'Ten', 'Boom', 'yellow', 'star', 'spite', 'Christian', 'faith', 'Corrie', 'Betsie', 'Jeannette', 'Clift', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'help', 'several', 'people', 'dressing', 'up', 'women', 'taking', 'country', 'Kik', 'Peter', 'nephews', 'even', 'help', 'build', 'make', 'shift', 'hiding', 'place', 'Jewish', 'people', 'hiding', 'underground', 'many', 'things', 'will', 'help', 'save', 'several', 'Jewish', 'people', 'Ten', 'Boom', 'family', 'assumed', 'be', 'hiding', 'Jews', 'never', 'proved', 'sent', 'off', 'Ravensbruck', 'Corrie', 'Betsie', 'must', 'keep', 'up', 'faith', 'God', 'prison', 'lose', 'everything', 'hopes', 'surviving.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'impeccable', 'one', 'only', 'movie', 'Jeannette', 'Clift', 'ever', 'did', 'was', 'amazing', 'preferred', 'acting', 'stage', 'more', 'one', 'role', 'can', 'touch', 'so', 'many', 'amazing', 'first', 'time', 'acting', 'acted', 'pun', 'intended', 'were', 'first', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'many', 'films', 'such', 'original', 'Haunting', 'back', 'many', 'who', 'may', 'find', 'familiar', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'aspect', 'showing', 'Christian', 'Jewish', 'religions', 'together', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'act', 'around', 'are', 'turn', 'demons', 'satan', 'process', 'light', 'fact', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'live', 'more', 'fear', 'telling', 'who', 'telling', 'truth', 'who', 'lying', 'think', 'thought', 'Hitler', 'was', 'antichrist', 'back', 'then', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'believable', 'had', 'gotten', 'everyone', 'wing', 'did', ""n't"", 'thank', 'God.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'want', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'happened', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'others', 'put', 'own', 'life', 'line', 'do', 'Ten', 'Booms', 'family', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'stories', 'there', 'one', 'many', 'inspired', 'so', 'many', 'give', 'lives', 'Christ', 'help', 'many', 'others', 'need', '5', 'stars', 'perfect', 'everything']",N/A

They answered it, and ultimately their response cost most of them their lives. This is their story, as told from the perspective of the sole survivor, Corrie Ten Boom.The Ten Booms were devoutly Christian and lived a simple life, working in their watch shop that had been in their family for over a hundred years. When the Nazis occupied Holland, they were appalled by the treatment of their fellow Jewish citizens at the hands of the Nazis. Initially, the seventy year old patriarch of the family, played to perfection by Arthur O'Connell, took to wearing a Jewish star himself in sympathy with their oppressed Jewish friends.As time went on, members of this heroic family began working with an underground, partisan group. When it became clear that Jews were being targeted for death and deportation, however, the family also began to hide terrified Jews in their home, after constructing a false wall in one of their bedrooms, thereby creating a secret room.Eventually denounced by someone to the Nazis, they are arrested in their home which is then torn apart by the Gestapo, in their search for the Jews they believe to be hiding there. At the time of their arrest, the Ten  Boom home was filled to capacity with Jews in hiding. So well concealed was the hidden room that had been created by the erection of the false wall, that these poor, terrified Jews managed to escape detection.The five Ten Booms, however, did not fare so well and were sent to the notorious Ravensbruck death camp, where Corrie and her sister, Betsie, managed to stay together. It is here that they learn the true depths of man's inhumanity to man, and Corrie's Christian faith is sorely tested.Betsie, affectingly played by the superb Julie Harris, does not survive the rigors and deprivations of Ravensbruck and dies. Within two weeks of her beloved sister's death, Corrie is miraculously released from Ravensbruck. It is years later that she learns that her release was a result of clerical error and that shortly after her release, middle-aged women, such as she, were systemically being put to death.Corrie was the only member of the Ten Boom family to survive the concentration camp experience. She told their story in a book upon which the movie is based. At the end of the film, the real Corrie Ten Boom, in her eighties at the time of the filming, appears and, in a profoundly moving way, tells why she told the story of her family. She is a stark reminder of the innate goodness to be found in humanity and is a strong counterpoint to the cruelty of the Nazi regime.I first saw this movie when it was first released in the mid nineteen seventies. It was as moving then, as it is now, twenty five years later. The themes which it touches upon are timeless. This superbly made film with its haunting musical score is peppered with award caliber performances. It is simply a great movie...Bravo!",5,INSPIRING SAGA OF A HEROIC FAMILY IN NAZI OCCUPIED HOLLAND,976924800,"12 16, 2000",2000,3055,"['true', 'story', 'heroic', 'Ten', 'Boom', 'family', 'who', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'Netherlands', 'asked', 'question', 'not', 'who', 'not', 'now', 'when', 'answered', 'ultimately', 'response', 'cost', 'most', 'lives', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'sole', 'survivor', 'Corrie', 'Ten', 'Boom.The', 'Ten', 'Booms', 'were', 'devoutly', 'Christian', 'lived', 'simple', 'life', 'working', 'watch', 'shop', 'had', 'been', 'family', 'hundred', 'years', 'When', 'Nazis', 'occupied', 'Holland', 'were', 'appalled', 'treatment', 'fellow', 'Jewish', 'citizens', 'hands', 'Nazis', 'Initially', 'seventy', 'year', 'old', 'patriarch', 'family', 'played', 'perfection', 'Arthur', ""O'Connell"", 'took', 'wearing', 'Jewish', 'star', 'sympathy', 'oppressed', 'Jewish', 'friends.As', 'time', 'went', 'members', 'heroic', 'family', 'began', 'working', 'underground', 'partisan', 'group', 'When', 'became', 'clear', 'Jews', 'were', 'being', 'targeted', 'death', 'deportation', 'however', 'family', 'also', 'began', 'hide', 'terrified', 'Jews', 'home', 'constructing', 'false', 'wall', 'one', 'bedrooms', 'thereby', 'creating', 'secret', 'room.Eventually', 'denounced', 'someone', 'Nazis', 'are', 'arrested', 'home', 'then', 'torn', 'apart', 'Gestapo', 'search', 'Jews', 'believe', 'be', 'hiding', 'there', 'time', 'arrest', 'Ten', 'Boom', 'home', 'was', 'filled', 'capacity', 'Jews', 'hiding', 'So', 'well', 'concealed', 'was', 'hidden', 'room', 'had', 'been', 'created', 'erection', 'false', 'wall', 'poor', 'terrified', 'Jews', 'managed', 'escape', 'detection.The', 'five', 'Ten', 'Booms', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'fare', 'so', 'well', 'were', 'sent', 'notorious', 'Ravensbruck', 'death', 'camp', 'where', 'Corrie', 'sister', 'Betsie', 'managed', 'stay', 'together', 'here', 'learn', 'true', 'depths', 'man', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'Corrie', 'Christian', 'faith', 'sorely', 'tested.Betsie', 'affectingly', 'played', 'superb', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'not', 'survive', 'rigors', 'deprivations', 'Ravensbruck', 'dies', 'two', 'weeks', 'beloved', 'sister', 'death', 'Corrie', 'miraculously', 'released', 'Ravensbruck', 'years', 'later', 'release', 'was', 'result', 'clerical', 'error', 'shortly', 'release', 'middle-aged', 'women', 'such', 'were', 'systemically', 'being', 'put', 'death.Corrie', 'was', 'only', 'member', 'Ten', 'Boom', 'family', 'survive', 'concentration', 'camp', 'experience', 'told', 'story', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'end', 'film', 'real', 'Corrie', 'Ten', 'Boom', 'eighties', 'time', 'filming', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'way', 'why', 'told', 'story', 'family', 'stark', 'reminder', 'innate', 'goodness', 'be', 'found', 'humanity', 'strong', 'counterpoint', 'cruelty', 'Nazi', 'regime.I', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'mid', 'nineteen', 'seventies', 'was', 'moving', 'then', 'now', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'themes', 'are', 'timeless', 'superbly', 'made', 'film', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'peppered', 'award', 'caliber', 'performances', 'simply', 'great', 'movie', 'Bravo']",N/A

207586,A32AJO8JPEHBIA,6300210901,mak1457,"[1, 1]","Corrie ten Boom was adamant that her story get to as many people as possible so they could know God's love as she experienced it. What better way to do it than turning to Hollywood to make it happen. And what better film company than World Wide Pictures, part of Billy Graham's worldwide ministry, to produce this unusual motion picture.This is an independent studio production so it's all the more impressive that the cast includes the notable screen personalities of Arthur O'Connell, Julie Harris, and Eileen Heckert. I find it amazing that these A-list Hollywood celebrities would even consider getting involved in this sort of project. But so many Christian films feature B-list actors with rather questionable acting skills that I'm glad a film of this stature included the talent it did. Julie Harris convincingly portrays the role of the sweet and godly Betsie and Arthur O'Connell bears a striking resemblance to the real Casper ten Boom. I wish he'd had a little more to do in the film since in the story, Corrie's father is ultimately the one who decides to open his home to Jewish refugees. Given her status, it's understandable that Julie Harris receives top billing for her role of Betsie. However, the real story is about Corrie, not Betsie. It's therefore regrettable that Harris tends to overshadow Jeanette Clift George. Sometimes you get the feeling this movie is more about Betsie than Corrie. Alas, that's Hollywood for you. But Ms. George doesn't do so badly herself, considering this is her first film. And in the end, she is the only one who survives so her character does come up on top. It just makes the film feel a little lopsided, that's all.Overall, the film remains true to the spirit of the book. Many people are probably put off by the seemingly overt Christian themes prevalent in the film. Actually, compared to the book, the film almost feels too watered down. There are, of course, the inevitable changes the film made to the story. It just comes with the territory so I don't feel too cheated as some might. But I would have been happy if the film had skipped several parts. The most glaring difference is the characterization of Eusie. The film degenerates his character from a delightful, memorable Jewish cantor to an ungrateful, obnoxious jerk. You'd almost rather see him captured by the Germans than have to put up with the likes of him. The film contains more than enough unsavory characters without adding one more unnecessary antagonist. There were a few other places I thought the book did a better job in telling the story than the film. I suppose that's subjective to one's own tastes so we won't go there. Too many characters in a film make it confusing so even though I would have liked to have seen more of the characters Corrie included in her book, it's probably just as well the film didn't add them.Production quality is sufficient given that Christian films don't usually have the budgets of their secular counterparts. The color appears drab and lifeless - normally not a good thing - but in this case, it fits the overall mood of the film. I'm a little bothered by the pictures at the beginning. I suppose they're okay but I'd rather see pictures of the real ten Boom family and not their Hollywood counterparts. The music, orchestrated and arranged by Tedd Smith (another Billy Graham associate), is beautiful and haunting and contributes to the overall sadness felt throughout the picture.This is an overall good companion to the book. You'll like this film probably more if you haven't read the book. Even if you know the book from cover to cover, the film  truly does justice in capturing the horrors inflicted upon Corrie and her family during this terrible time. This is Hollywood's version of Corrie, true.

Fine story, excellent acting.  True, the color appears deteriorated (like an old family movie), but the photography is first rate.  The music is very good indeed, though by the end the main musical theme was wearing a bit thin.  (Perhaps wearing out is appropriate to the subject matter.)

Sure, there are struggles, but most of us have food to eat, roofs over our heads, money to spend on entertainment and things, and most importantly, our political and religious freedom.  We haven't a clue what it's like to truly fear that our government will take away our most cherished rights.  We need not worry that we will be imprisoned, tortured, killed or simply denied the right to earn a living because of our religion or ethnic background.Imagine our world turned upside down.  Everyone knows the history, the horrors wrought on the world by the Nazis.  The nightmare that was life in Europe in the 1930's and 1940's need not be repeated here.  How would you respond to that evil?  Would you blame God?  Would you denounce your beliefs and principles to protect your life, the lives of your family and friends or your family business?  Would you turn away from the slaughter of innocents to save your own skin?  Hopefully, none of us will ever have to answer those questions.The Hiding Place shows you how one family, the Ten Booms of the Netherlands, answered those questions.  They risked everything they had, and suffered horribly (in Dutch prisons and Nazi concentration camps), to save the lives of Jews trying to flee from (or hide in) Nazi-occupied Netherlands.The movie will challenge you to question how far you would go to do what you believe is right.  For so-called ""people of faith,"" you will question whether you would be like Job and honor God despite the trials, or whether you would renounce him.  One cannot watch this film without asking, ""Do I have even a sliver (mustard seed, perhaps) of the faith of the Ten Booms?""More than challenging, The Hiding Place is inspiring.  It made me believe that I can do more for people than I realize, and that there are no obstacles that others, like the Ten Booms, have faced and overcome.",5,Maybe the most challenging film you'll ever see,1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,1963,"['Even', 'hard', 'economic', 'times', 'periods', 'political', 'turmoil', 'life', 'America', 'most', 'pretty', 'good', 'Sure', 'are', 'struggles', 'most', 'have', 'food', 'eat', 'roofs', 'heads', 'money', 'spend', 'entertainment', 'things', 'most', 'importantly', 'political', 'religious', 'freedom', 'have', ""n't"", 'clue', 'what', 'truly', 'fear', 'government', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'most', 'cherished', 'rights', 'need', 'not', 'worry', 'will', 'be', 'imprisoned', 'tortured', 'killed', 'simply', 'denied', 'right', 'earn', 'living', 'religion', 'ethnic', 'background.Imagine', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'Everyone', 'history', 'horrors', 'wrought', 'world', 'Nazis', 'nightmare', 'was', 'life', 'Europe', '1930', '1940', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'repeated', 'here', 'How', 'would', 'respond', 'evil', 'Would', 'blame', 'God', 'Would', 'denounce', 'beliefs', 'principles', 'protect', 'life', 'lives', 'family', 'friends', 'family', 'business', 'Would', 'turn', 'away', 'slaughter', 'innocents', 'save', 'own', 'skin', 'Hopefully', 'none', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'answer', 'questions.The', 'Hiding', 'Place', 'shows', 'how', 'one', 'family', 'Ten', 'Booms', 'Netherlands', 'answered', 'questions', 'risked', 'everything', 'had', 'suffered', 'horribly', 'Dutch', 'prisons', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camps', 'save', 'lives', 'Jews', 'trying', 'flee', 'hide', 'Nazi-occupied', 'Netherlands.The', 'movie', 'will', 'challenge', 'question', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'do', 'what', 'believe', 'right', 'so-called', 'people', 'faith', 'will', 'question', 'would', 'be', 'Job', 'honor', 'God', 'trials', 'would', 'renounce', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'film', 'asking', 'Do', 'have', 'even', 'sliver', 'mustard', 'seed', 'perhaps', 'faith', 'Ten', 'Booms', 'More', 'challenging', 'Hiding', 'Place', 'inspiring', 'made', 'believe', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'people', 'realize', 'are', 'obstacles', 'others', 'Ten', 'Booms', 'have', 'faced', 'overcome']",N/A
