I, being the snarky student that I was, asked a question around the Viking discovery of America: why didn't the Vikings mention battles with the skraelings (the Viking name for American Indians) more?The professor's response: ""They came from fish and ice and when they got to North America, it was more fish and ice.  The skraelings were more of a nuisance than anything.""I always thought the notion of battles between Vikings and Native Americans would make a good movie. Sure enough, along comes Pathfinder about precisely that.Almost.Of course, Hollywood had to go and muck up the idea.  So instead of the plot really being about a Native American warrior fighting Vikings, it's about a Viking (read: a white guy) raised by the natives.  Instead of portraying the Native American warriors as worthy opponents, they're cast as complete morons incapable of detecting a simple pit trap constructed by our protagonist.  Instead of crafting a compelling tale about a clash between two very different cultures, Pathfinder turns into every Hollywood clich&eacute; imaginable, from a lone warrior leading his enemies onto thin ice to skiing down a mountain slope on a shield.Pathfinder is far more interested with its cinematography. The movie is shot like scenes from a Frank Frazetta painting, with faceless horned warriors and rippling muscles wielding wicked-looking axes and flails overhead.  Great stuff for paintings, not so great for a movie.300 did all of this, from the digitally inserted blood to the culture clash, heroic speeches to demonized villains, only better. By the time stock footage of an avalanche appeared on screen, my hopes for Pathfinder were dashed along with the Vikings on the rocks.",2,300 did it better,1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,1853,"['long', 'time', 'ago', 'Columbus', 'scholar', 'came', 'undergrad', 'college', 'continue', 'debate', 'significance', 'Columbus', 'discovery', 'America', 'being', 'snarky', 'student', 'was', 'asked', 'question', 'Viking', 'discovery', 'America', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Vikings', 'mention', 'battles', 'skraelings', 'Viking', 'name', 'American', 'Indians', 'more', 'professor', 'response', 'came', 'fish', 'ice', 'when', 'got', 'North', 'America', 'was', 'more', 'fish', 'ice', 'skraelings', 'were', 'more', 'nuisance', 'anything', 'always', 'thought', 'notion', 'battles', 'Vikings', 'Native', 'Americans', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'Sure', 'enough', 'Pathfinder', 'precisely', 'that.Almost.Of', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'go', 'muck', 'up', 'idea', 'So', 'instead', 'plot', 'really', 'being', 'Native', 'American', 'warrior', 'fighting', 'Vikings', 'Viking', 'read', 'white', 'guy', 'raised', 'natives', 'Instead', 'portraying', 'Native', 'American', 'warriors', 'worthy', 'opponents', ""'re"", 'cast', 'complete', 'morons', 'incapable', 'detecting', 'simple', 'pit', 'trap', 'constructed', 'protagonist', 'Instead', 'crafting', 'compelling', 'tale', 'clash', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'cultures', 'Pathfinder', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 'imaginable', 'lone', 'warrior', 'leading', 'enemies', 'thin', 'ice', 'skiing', 'down', 'mountain', 'slope', 'shield.Pathfinder', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'shot', 'scenes', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'painting', 'faceless', 'horned', 'warriors', 'rippling', 'muscles', 'wielding', 'wicked-looking', 'axes', 'flails', 'overhead', 'Great', 'stuff', 'paintings', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'movie.300', 'did', 'digitally', 'inserted', 'blood', 'culture', 'clash', 'heroic', 'speeches', 'demonized', 'villains', 'only', 'better', 'time', 'stock', 'footage', 'avalanche', 'appeared', 'screen', 'hopes', 'Pathfinder', 'were', 'dashed', 'Vikings', 'rocks']",N/A

Many if not most of the criticisms levelled against the movie, Pathfinder, seemed pretty on the spot.  And yet I did enjoy the movie, at least on the level of action & adventure.In my opinion, the movie has invested almost all of its creativity into style, but everything else pretty much suffers.  Things like plot, character development, and acting are uneven at best, and sometimes just embarassingly misplaced.  Even the setting was unrealistic; in minutes I realized that the film was not shot on the east coast of Canada, where Vikings historically landed, but found out in the credits that the film was done in British Colombia.  This disregard to accuracy is seen in many places and contributed to the unbelievability of the story.  It's sad, because I like the idea of this story & I enjoyed the style in which it was photographed.

One minute the Hero is off to hunt in the woods with his Lil Sister, then he is standing at the top a snow covered mountain gathering pelts.

Then the rest of the movie is Ghost trying to kill off the vikings with help from some indian allies.I give the movie 3 stars but it really is not horrible as some reviewers seem to point out. I think that they had a good idea and very good cinematography, it's just that the story seems a bit lacking. I think Karl Urban as Ghost is quiet good, very ""strong silent"" type, which I think is understandable given that when he does speak the others tend to mock him. Moon Bloodgood is also good as Starfire the indian girl love interest of Ghost.There are a lot of reviewers obsessed with the fact that vikings didn't have horns, well let's come to the realization people that this is a MOVIE, not a documentary . If you watch the special features you'll see that the filmmakers know that they didn't have horns, and they took great liberties with their dress. Why? Because it's a MOVIE, not a documentary.Now why would I recommend anyone who likes action adventure movies to buy this one? Because it is just that, an action adventure movie, it's not trying to give a message, or push an agenda.

This is a mythological exercise depicting an invasion of North America by the Vikings, coming complete with conflict between them and the Native Americans.  As very little of what happens is historically real or geographically accurate, the strength of this film lies totally in the belief that the Vikings are ultra brutal and the Native Americans are utterly peaceful by comparison.  The combination is a slaughter of any of the inferior Native Americans by the Norsemen.Pathfinder is an obscure concept attributed to the chiefs of the Native American tribes.  Around this concept the film develops rather weakly.  The lead character is the child of Norsemen, who somehow is along for the invasion of North America, and is rejected by his father for not killing a Native American child captured in one of the raids.  The child is rescued by a Native America woman and raised among those people.The whole story is a collection of broken plot developments that have no cohesive comprehension.  It is a disjointed film that seems to rely mostly on the brutality of the Norsemen for it's appeal.  Which is really a shame, because the story possibilities with this concept were wide opening and capable of producing something of great and wonderful imagination.  I give it 3 stars because it was an underdeveloped movie.  The audience will rarely find anything brilliant or outstanding to cheer for in this one.  On the whole it is a letdown.

1080722,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000R9U3AQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","""Pathfinder"" could have been fun had it not taken itself so seriously. The violence in this film is extreme, pretty much to the point of overshadowing everything else. This wouldn't have been a problem has this been a highly stylized parody, something that's willing to flaunt its intentional gratuitousness. Consider last month's ""300,"" an over the top male fantasy in which limbs fly, heads roll, and blood sprays from gaping wounds. Yes, the violence was incredibly overplayed, but it was supposed to be. It's a comic book fable drenched in testosterone, and that enabled the audience to take it with a grain of salt. ""Pathfinder"" doesn't have the guts to point at itself and laugh; every scene is somber and dripping with emotion, qualities that don't allow such acts of violence to be tolerated.It doesn't help that the story is paper thin, practically bordering on nonexistent. What little story we have is overshadowed by wall-to-wall action sequences. Did director Marcus Nispel (who also directed 2003's incredible remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") really think that forgoing plot and character development would benefit this film? I'll be the first to admit that action scenes are fun to watch. Still, a solid story has to back them up; otherwise, all you'll have is a series of swordfights, stabbings, and beheadings that don't add up to anything worthwhile. I wanted to laugh and clap my hands while watching this film. I wanted to feel invigorated. I was let down; by the time I left the theater, I was emotionally drained.Here's the plot. Long, long ago, a ruthless army of Vikings invaded North America, slaughtering every Native American tribe they happen to come across. After one such massacre, the young son of a prominent Viking warrior was left behind (he defied his father by refusing to murder a ""savage""). Discovered by a passing woman, the frightened child is taken in and raised amidst a local tribe. The story then flashes forward fifteen years, at which point the abandoned Viking is now an adult (Karl Urban). Because of his distinctly Scandinavian complexion, he's called Ghost, a name that's difficult to accept as either insulting or affectionately playful (I'm surprised he took to it at all, but never mind). Despite being raised as part of this tribe, nightmares of the day he was abandoned leave him confused over his true identity. Which of his two worlds does he belong in? Only one? Both? Neither?The answer to that question comes when a new army of Vikings begins an invasion. Many of Ghost's fellow tribesmen are brutally murdered, including his kindhearted mother. This ignites the fires of revenge, which, as you probably guessed, entails hunting down and destroying every Viking he comes into contact with. Needless to say, such a decision paves the way for even more gory death scenes, all of which go just this side of too far. It also paves the way for sequence in which Ghost causes an avalanche, which would have been acceptable had the footage not looked like something from a National Geographic special.There's really no need to delve further into the plot; that pretty much sums it up. There's no rule stating that a story has to be complicated in order to be good. In this regard, ""Pathfinder"" delivers; this is your basic revenge story, and it plays out exactly the way one would expect it to. Some may even appreciate the fact that the dialogue is sparse, with each character getting fewer than ten lines into the entire film (which is a brisk eighty-eight minutes, I might add). Action film buffs will get a kick out of this movie because there's nothing to emotionally invest in, especially in terms of the characters. It's a bare-bones series of death scenes, all of which are milked for all that they're worth.But this time--unfortunately--the violence doesn't add to the appeal of the film. Had this been a super stylized fable, a story that reveled in its bloodiness, then it could have been a rip-roaring good time. It fails in that it tries to be something more, namely a human drama of self-discovery. We know that Ghost is fighting against his own kind, but we don't really get to see how this is affecting him. He may have been raised in a different culture, but his Viking roots are inescapable. If the filmmakers truly wanted to play up the drama, they could have explored his conflicting emotions. True, that would detract from the death scenes, but at least it would give this film some depth. The best we're given is a romantic subplot with a woman from another tribe (Moon Bloodgood). Not only does their relationship add nothing to the film, it also goes nowhere.I know I should be seeing ""Pathfinder"" in a different light; believe it or not, part of me does want to recommend it for the sheer escapism of it. But I don't feel this is something one should escape to. The violence is too strong for the emotion to sink in. Likewise, the drama is too prominent for the violence to be entertaining. If you truly want to get your money's worth from needless violence, ""300"" is your best bet.",3,The Sword and the Fury,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,5068,"['Pathfinder', 'could', 'have', 'been',

1080725,A1CYOHNGQ1WED1,B000R9U3AQ,Christopher Hivner,"[26, 37]","The story behind Pathfinder is that a crew of Vikings raid the coast of North America, killing all the Indians they see. One young boy, about 8-10 years old, refuses his father's order to kill Indian children and is left behind when the Vikings leave. He is then raised by an Indian woman, accepted but not entirely by the tribe. 15 years later the Vikings return and the boy now a man has to defend his adopted people.What a load of stinking, festering garbage this movie is. Its affront to history is unbelievable, as is everything that happens in this film. The makers got absolutely nothing right with the Vikings. The swords and axes they are carrying are not authentic, but some cheap fantasy made up in a Hollywood prop house. None of them are carrying spears even though this was a favorite weapon of Vikings. One of them is using a flail which won't be invented for another 200 years. The helmets they are wearing are abominable. They are not the correct shape or size and Vikings did not wear horns on them. Some of them are wearing shoulder pauldrons and chest plates. Again, not used in Northern Europe for a few hundred years. Some of the Vikings were riding war horses. If this was raiding party, the ships they were using would be small and light to cross the water fast. No room for giant horses. The boy would not have been part of any raid. Why would a band of seasoned Vikings raiders, coming to plunder, rape and steal, bring along a 10 year old boy? Besides that Vikings never raided in North America. They tried to settle here and begin trading with the Indians. Hostilities eventually arose because of a language barrier and cultural differences. Because the Indians greatly outnumbered the Vikings, the Norse eventually left and gave up colonizing North America.Even if you overlook the travesty of the Viking portrayal, this is still a stupid movie for so many reasons. When the Vikings come back after 15 years and have wiped out the village and the one they left behind is the only one left, they recognize that he is not an Indian. So they give him a sword to see if he can fight. Yeah, that's what you want to do. Deliberately arm your unarmed enemy. Then he kills one Viking and plucks anothers eye out with the tip of the sword. So somehow during 15 years with the Indians, who don't use swords to fight, he has become a master of the broad sword. Later in the film he is supposedly leading the Vikings to the next village so they can do some more slaughtering. An Indian woman he is in love with is angry at him for complying. To let her know that he is tricking the Vikings, he says something like ""they come from the land of endless snow. They don't know about our spring."" He then begins to lead them across a frozen lake that is thawing because of the rising temperatures and the ice breaks, killing several of the Norsemen. Newsflash: while it snows a lot in Scandinavia, it doesn't snow 365 days a year. They have spring there. They would know about lakes thawing out when it gets warm.I hated this movie.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 3]","A brief history lesson -- the Vikings were the first Europeans to land in the Americas, almost five hundred years before Columbus. They even settled down to live there for awhile, though it didn't last.There's a brilliant movie somewhere in that story -- an epic of exploration, discovery and struggle between two very different peoples. Too bad ""Pathfinder"" isn't that movie, with its mindless action, ridiculous characters, and a pompous stream of wretched dialogue and silly direction. It's a disaster, pure and simple.An American Indian woman found a little boy abandoned in the ruin of a Viking ship, and brought him bck to her people, where he was renamed Ghost and brought up as one of them. But though Ghost (Karl Urban) becomes strong and well-liked, he's still haunted by his Viking past -- until the day he sees dragon boats coming to shore, and his village is brutally slaughtered.Wounded and left for dead, Ghost is found by a hunting party that includes Starfire (Moon Bloodgood), the token love interest. When the Vikings find him again, he must outwit the small army of Vikings, protect his remaining people from them -- and finally settle his divided feelings about his own identity.Yeah, it's all a cliche -- outcast hero raised among peaceful people, finds inner peace by kicking savage butts of his birth race. Even in the hands of a good director this would be staggeringly unexiting -- and it isn't in the hands of a good director. It's in Marcus ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake"" Nispel's hands.And Nispel has clearly decided that this is his magnum opus: creepy lighting, slow-motion, and pompous dramatic shots like swords being lifted from the snow (signaling that this is a Very Significant Moment). But there's nothing that even a good action movie should have -- there is no logic, cohesion, plot or good dialogue (""The prophecy... is coming to fulfilment!"").Instead, Nispel packs it with gore, swords and torture, to demonstrate that all the Vikings are PURE EVIL, lest you waste any sympathy on them. But his action scenes are more likely to inspire laughter than horror or cheap thrills, especially when Ghost starts fighting the Vikings... in a SLED CHASE. Really. It only gets campier and sillier as time goes on, until Ghost defeats the bad guys by triggering an avalanche... by yelling.Karl Urban is a deeply talented actor with immense presence... and an unfortunate tendency to pick some really awful action movies. He does the best that anyone could do with such a flimsy character (come on, who really thinks Ghost would join the Vikings?), which isn't that much. Bloodgood is basically a token love interest, and not a very realistic one either.As for the supporting characters, they might as well be played by paper dolls. The Indians are stereotypically peaceful, spiritual and very boring, with names like Starfire and Wind in Tree. And the Vikings are grunting, thick-skulled behemoths in bloodstained horned skull helmets, with no sign of higher brain function. These aren't Vikings, these are orcs.A promising idea gets buried under a steaming, putrescent heap of mindless action, logic-free scripting, and characters so thin you could wrap Christmas presents in them.

1080745,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B000R9U3AQ,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[1, 2]","Others have described this movie well enough already. My comment to add would be how visually rich, but too congested, this film is. The images are dense, so much so that it is hard for the eyes to find what is most pertinent in the film's frames as they pass. The prevailing black and white and sepia tones, with little other colour in evidence, contrast dark and clotted, do not help to clarify the images. There is a lot of ""action"" in all of this, and because of this visual congestion (or indigestion!) it is hard for the eyes to follow.The plot pits wicked European males, this time the Vikings, against North America's ""noble savages"". It does make some sense, but the mix of legendary evocation with historical fantasy is not totally convincing. The acting is passable.Enjoy this motion picture for what it has to offer, without being too hard on it. It is exciting and however dense things become, visually and narratively, the basic premises and story flow are clear enough for all of that.NOTA BENE (late July 2013).Recently I have acquired a DVD equipment which, among other improvements over my earlier player, is capable of playing DVDs in the P.A.L. (European) format. To celebrate that, I ordered several films that I long have wanted to obtain, but are available, at least for now, only in editions of DVD-P.A.L. One of them is ""Ofelas = Pathfinder"" (Kinowelt 500392), the original 1987 Scandanavian film on which the North American adaptation, made twenty years later in 2007, is based.  It definitely was worth searching out. Some comments, as well as a modification in my review title, are in order!The 1987 motion picture offers roughly the same basic plot, but it is more convincingly set out in its very northerly, Scandanavian setting, the Lapp region, within the Arctic Circle. Here the winter is cruelly harsh in low as well as at high elevations. The struggle for survival of the Lapp (Sami) people is  a precarious one that North American native peoples did not face to nearly such a daunting degree. The Scandanavian film's setting, not surprisingly, is far more austere, and less lushly colourful, than that of the North American film. However, that only adds to the 1987 movie's stark appeal.The cast consists mostly of Sami actors, who have a visual edge in such ethnic consistency, which helps appreciably to make all of them convincing in their roles. In the case of Mikkel Gaup, who at the time of the 1987 motion picture was in his late teens, there was one Sami among them who went on to have a relatively large and successful film career. Mikkel Gaup, at that particular age, was a strikingly handsome lad and his acting, as Aigin, who becomes a ""pathfinder"" for his people by action's end, is the best of the film's cast and he also generates some real, incipiently romantic warmth.  However, to be fair to the others, their acting only may seem a bit stiff due to the English dubbing, the words coming across accurately enough, but a bit woodenly. (There are subtitles, too, helpful, as their presence usually is.)I like both films rather a lot, although I suspect that it will be the 1987 film, of the two, that I shall view more frequently in the years ahead.",3,Less Visual Congestion Would Have Done This 2007 Movie a Whole Lot of Good; the 1987 Film Has No Such (or Any Other) Problem!,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,3201,"['Others', 'have', 'described', 'movie', 'well', 'enough', 'already', 'comment', 'add', 'would', 'be', 'how', 'visually', 'rich', 'too', 'congested', 'film', 'images', 'are', 'dense', 'so', 'much', 'hard', 'eyes', 'find', 'what', 'most', 'pertinent', 'film', 'frames', 'pass', 'prevailing', 'black', 'white', 'sepia', 'tones', 'little', 'other', 'colour', 'evidence', 'contrast', 'dark', 'clotted', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'clarify', 'images', 'lot', 'action', 'visual', 'congestion', 'indigestion', 'hard', 'eyes', 'follow.The', 'plot', 'pits', 'wicked', 'European', 'males', 'time', 'Vikings', 'North', 'America', 'noble', 'savages', 'make', 'sense', 'mix', 'legendary', 'evocation', 'historical', 'fantasy', 'not', 'totally', 'convincing', 'acting', 'motion', 'picture', 'what', 'offer', 'being', 'too', 'hard', 'exciting', 'however', 'dense', 'things', 'become', 'visually', 'narratively', 'basic', 'premises', 'story', 'flow', 'are', 'clear', 'enough', 'that.NOTA', 'BENE', 'late', 'July', '2013', '.Recently', 'have', 'acquired', 'DVD', 'equipment', 'other', 'improvements', 'earlier', 'player', 'capable', 'playing', 'DVDs', 'P.A.L', 'European', 'format', 'celebrate', 'ordered', 'several', 'films', 'long', 'have', 'wanted', 'obtain', 'are', 'available', 'least', 'now', 'only', 'editions', 'DVD-P.A.L', 'One', 'Ofelas', '=', 'Pathfinder', 'Kinowelt', '500392', 'original', '1987', 'Scandanavian', 'film', 'North', 'American', 'adaptation', 'made', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', '2007', 'based', 'definitely', 'was', 'worth', 'searching', 'out', 'comments', 'as', 'well', 'modification', 'review', 'title', 'are', 'order', '1987', 'motion', 'picture', 'roughly', 'same', 'basic', 'plot', 'more', 'convincingly', 'set', 'out', 'very', 'northerly', 'Scandanavian', 'setting', 'Lapp', 'region', 'Arctic', 'Circle', 'Here', 'winter', 'cruelly', 'harsh', 'low', 'as', 'well', 'high', 'elevations', 'struggle', 'survival', 'Lapp', 'Sami', 'people', 'precarious', 'one', 'North', 'American', 'native', 'peoples', 'did', 'not', 'face', 'nearly', 'such', 'daunting', 'degree', 'Scandanavian', 'film', 'setting', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'far', 'more', 'austere', 'less', 'lushly', 'colourful', 'North', 'American', 'film', 'However', 'only', '1987', 'movie', 'stark', 'appeal.The', 'cast', 'mostly', 'Sami', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'visual', 'edge', 'such', 'ethnic', 'consistency', 'appreciably', 'make', 'convincing', 'roles', 'case', 'Mikkel', 'Gaup', 'who', 'time', '1987', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'late', 'teens', 'was', 'one', 'Sami', 'who', 'went', 'have', 'relatively', 'large', 'successful', 'film', 'career', 'Mikkel', 'Gaup', 'particular', 'age', 'was', 'strikingly', 'handsome', 'lad', 'acting', 'Aigin', 'who', 'pathfinder', 'people', 'action', 'end', 'best', 'film', 'cast', 'also', 'real', 'incipiently', 'romantic', 'warmth', 'However', 'be', 'fair', 'others', 'acting', 'only', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'stiff', 'due', 'English', 'dubbing', 'words', 'coming', 'accurately', 'enough', 'bit', 'woodenly', 'are', 'subtitles', 'too', 'helpful', 'presence', 'usually', 'like', 'films', 'rather', 'lot', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', '1987', 'film', 'two', 'shall', 'view', 'more', 'frequently', 'years', 'ahead']",N/A

I am confused about the viewers opinions.  If anyone took time to read the statements by the director, producers, and other people connected with the movie, they clearly state that this is not an historical epic.  Speaking as an historian, if you want pure and accurate history watch the History Channel (maybe) or better yet read a book.  This book was no more meant to be true to history than Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.  Perhaps if Peter Jackson or Chris Columbus had directed and Viggo Mortensen or Daniel Radcliffe had starred, it would have been much more favorably received.Instead, the movie depicts a fictional, not fictionalized, work.  My understanding was that it is based on a MYTH (perhaps you should look up the word Myth). It was meant to entertain.  It was in that frame of mind that I saw the movie (I had read the director's/producer's comments).Is it bloody - YES, but so are many other highly rated ""epics"".Is it believable - In some places, but not in all.Is the acting good - more than adequate, very good in places.Is the dialogue good and believable - So-so.Is it a true representation of either the Vikings or Native Americans - Not really.Is the cinematography any good - YES.Is it Oscar material - NO!Is it entertaining - Absolutely.So What happened?

When the Vikings return to pillage and kill, however, Ghost must confront his former people and drive them from the land once and for all. It's a compelling concept loosely based on fact with a heavy dose of the ""what if,"" and considering that Vikings and American Indians have enjoyed so few couplings despite historic record, this could have been a perfect marriage.But that's where everything falls apart. ""Pathfinder"" is a mess of great ideas poorly executed by director Marcus Nispel, who seems far more intent on visuals than storytelling. And the visuals are certainly pleasing to the eye, despite an overdone use of slow motion. Even his lopsided portrayal of the Norse invaders works when the bad guys are in full armor, as their bestial, almost alien nature is befitting of how they must have appeared to the natives at that time. Still, there is not one believable or well-drawn character in this film -- not even Karl Urban's Ghost. The lack of empathy would hamstring the story even if it were exceptionally good... which it is not. Too much of ""Pathfinder"" is men hacking and slashing each other to computer generated spumes of blood, or quite simply men walking from place to place in silence. The unrated director's cut does nothing to alleviate these issues, but instead throws a few more guts your way as well as a laughable underwater dialog scene.I wanted to like ""Pathfinder,"" but it's a bad movie, pure and simple.

The indians are so glossy and well-fed and cute that they could be models from a Sears Catalogue. Urban is in no way a physically heroic figure. He could be your nextdoor neighbor who works for Wal-Mart. He's flat looking with no pecs or powerful looking limbs. I think this is why the movie 300 proved to be such a staggering blockbuster.

The nude love scene would have been better without so much censorship involved (camera shot from 300 yards away), and flipping the male/female positions used.  Also, the film drags a bit in spots.  But the majority of the time this film is acceptable for watching all the way through, and I'm saying it is above ""B"" movie status.Although ""The Crazies"" (2010 release) has pitchfork use as a weapon; ""Pathfinder"" does not.  There is abundant CGI blood FX, some gore, dismemberment (but no sodomy of body parts), brutal violence and intense sword play, bow & arrows, battle axe, pick, mace, lance, and chain weapons, and some death by percussion (you'll figure it out).

After hearing the first line of dialogue from clancy (gunnar) my friends and I began crying with tears of laughter.  We just couldn't help but notice how close (despite speaking in icelandic/nordic/viking) he sounded like Mr. Krabs from spongebob squarepants.  Soon after, we added ""spongebob"" to the end of every line he said. Shortly after that, we started adding squidward and of course ""me money!"".  Carl Urban has the unfortunate ability to have the ""deer in the headlights"" look, without even trying.  Looking perpetually surprised, it was hard to take either character too seriously in the movie.  The overall plot isn't a bad idea. ""If the vikings landed in america first, Why didn't they colonize north america before mainland europe?""

1080763,A2J9DFIQ2EEFXC,B000R9U3AQ,john washington,"[4, 7]","This isn't P.C. but I'm going to say it, Vikings are cooler than Indians.  If you agree with that, you probably will not like this film.  First, the Viking's are cartoons, caricatures not resembling historical Vikings in the least.  In the film they more closely resemble zombies or orc's accompanied by the sound effects of dogs barking or a subtle lion's growl when speaking.  They are faceless and silly.Undoubtedly due to political correctness the Indians are angelic, and plain.  Unfortunately the audience spends plenty of `down time' with them leading to many drawn out scenes, slowing the pace of the film.  The filmmakers took liberties only with their habitats which are strongly reminiscent of the ewok village.Again, due to political correctness the Indians are the angels and the Vikings are the devils, but unfortunately the filmmakers didn't have the gall to make an Indian the protagonist.  Instead the hero's an orphaned Caucasian!  The premise is the Vikings don't colonize because the Indians fight them off. (If you're familiar with world history at all, 'liberties' taken in this film may also diminish it.)  But by putting a Caucasian as the hero instead of an Indian, the filmmakers are inadvertently saying that an Indian lead wouldn't be attractive or palatable enough for a mainstream audience.  At the same time they are belittling the Indians by saying, they couldn't have fought off the Viking's with out the leadership of a white man.  This film was obviously sculpted into something they wanted politically correct but instead it is riddled with irony.The plusses, the cinematography was great.  Visually the film was attractive and Clancy brown (highlander) as the lead Viking was fantastic.

1080765,A3HBNOC6ANFNSK,B000R9U3AQ,Jonathan C. Pike,"[8, 18]","So I was sitting here remembering what a god awful movie ""Pathfinder"" was and it made me so angry that I decided to write a review so as to warn other potential viewers away.  I expected it to be another review read by about 2 people (I mean, seriously, who the hell would watch Pathfinder anyway?), but I felt obliged to save those 2 poor souls.  Imagine my surprise when I looked up this crapfest and found over 100 reviews of the movie, some involving rather heated debates!Here's the thing: Pathfinder is absolutely terrible.  I can't believe the people defending it as this deep movie that shows the realism of the Native American - Viking conflict, and that somehow it's over the head of the average action movie fan who likes being ""spoon fed"" everything.  Apparently, we just don't get it.  Who needs trivial things like meaningful dialogue (or dialogue at all, for that matter), characters about whom you'd give a crap if they lived or died, at least semi-human antagonists, some semblance of historical accuracy, or a plot that makes the slightest bit of sense?  All this can be forgiven because in Pathfinder, we have an accurate portrayal of Indians, and a real sense of fear is created in the film.  Except that Indians weren't retarded, peace-loving simpletons who got slaughtered by Vikings everywhere they went: rather the reverse, in fact, due to their superior numbers that eventually drove Vikings from North America.  And as for the supposed element of fear created, the only fear I had was that the movie would continue for another hour after the main character threw his evil Viking nemesis off the cliff, documenting his ""realistic"" ""romance"" with the Indian woman as they sat staring at one another, saying absolutely nothing and showing no emotions whatsoever.  Thankfully, this did not occur, but I was still livid after having watched this garbage.This movie felt like it was directed, produced, and cast by a mongoloid chimp with a caved in skull.  Even for a mindless, silly action movie (which is what I expected going in), it fails spectacularly.

1080766,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000R9U3AQ,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[4, 7]","**No Spoilers**There is an old legend that says America was discovered by Vikings, way before Christopher Columbus. Of course, there is no hard evidence, but this myth sparks speculations about who really came to these lands first. It is also a great idea for a movie, if done correctly. Pathfinder tells the tale of a Viking child who was left to death by the visitors, but grew up to become a Native American--imagine Dances with Wolves mixed with Conan. Despite being visually stunning, Pathfinder has very little dialogue, unintentional laughs and no character development, but it's not boring. Conan fans will probably find the film quite entertaining.Story:Pathfinder takes place in North America 600 years before Christopher Columbus. A young Viking boy is found by an Indian woman in an abandoned Viking ship, surrounded by dead bodies--the young boy was left to death by the evil Vikings because the boy refused to kill some Indians. The Indians call him ""Ghost."" 15 years passes by and now he is a young man (Karl Urban) walking around the village, ready to take the world, fulfill a prophecy, and also the girl (`Starfire' played by Moon Bloodgood). Unfortunately things are about to get ugly, and fast. The Vikings or the ""Dragon People"" are back to these lands to finish off the Indians once and for all. While Ghost is away, the foreigners manage to destroy his village --killing many of them. Anger blinds him. Now he is ready for revenge. Is he up for the challenge?Review:These kinds of stories--the young man who betrays his own race to fight for his adopting nation--have been beat to death for many years by Hollywood. In other words, Pathfinder does not have an original story. The clich&eacute; factor is a drawback. Not only that, the very little dialogue is preposterous and even laughable--the Native Americans spoke perfect English and the Vikings spoke a strange language with subtitles! We heard some people laughed in the theater, not intended by the filmmakers. The action sequences are unintentional funny as well. Where are you going to see Vikings chasing someone in a sled? Once again, we get good actors, but very little material to work with. They are reduced to ""comic book"" characters. Our evil Vikings are nothing but pushover and their IQ is extremely low--they manage to cross the Atlantic Ocean, but many fall prey to couple Indian warriors.Are there any good things about this film? Of course, it is all about the visuals. We marvel at the artistic cinematography--it has a very surreal vision of the new world. We also like the costume design, especially the Vikings. They have a peculiar look which reminds us of the orcs from Lord of the Rings, but taller. The action, although silly, is entertaining. The movie doesn't drag at all.The Verdict:We will never know for certain if Vikings came to America before Columbus, but one thing is for sure, Pathfinder is your silly action film about a boy who grew up to love his adopted land (America). In order to fulfill his destiny, he had to fight against those who betrayed him as a child. Pathfinder has very little story, but good action and visuals that might entertain.",3,"""Dances with Wolves"" meets ""Conan""",1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,3164,"['**No', 'Spoilers**There', 'old', 'legend', 'America', 'was', 'discovered', 'Vikings', 'way', 'Christopher', 'Columbus', 'course', 'hard', 'evidence', 'myth', 'speculations', 'who', 'really', 'came', 'lands', 'first', 'also', 'great', 'idea', 'movie', 'done', 'correctly', 'Pathfinder', 'tale', 'Viking', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'death', 'visitors', 'grew', 'up', 'become', 'Native', 'American', 'imagine', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'mixed', 'Conan', 'being', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Pathfinder', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'unintentional', 'laughs', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'boring', 'Conan', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'film', 'quite', 'entertaining.Story', 'Pathfinder', 'place', 'North', 'America', '600', 'years', 'Christopher', 'Columbus', 'A', 'young', 'Viking', 'boy', 'found', 'Indian', 'woman', 'abandoned', 'Viking', 'ship', 'surrounded', 'dead', 'bodies', 'young', 'boy', 'was', 'left', 'death', 'evil', 'Vikings', 'boy', 'refused', 'kill', 'Indians', 'Indians', 'call', 'Ghost', '15', 'years', 'passes', 'now', 'young', 'man', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'walking', 'village', 'ready', 'take', 'world', 'fulfill', 'prophecy', 'also', 'girl', 'Starfire', 'played', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'are', 'get', 'ugly', 'fast', 'Vikings', 'Dragon', 'People', 'are', 'back', 'lands', 'finish', 'off', 'Indians', 'once', 'Ghost', 'away', 'foreigners', 'manage', 'destroy', 'village', 'killing', 'many', 'Anger', 'Now', 'ready', 'revenge', 'up', 'challenge', 'Review', 'kinds', 'stories', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'race', 'fight', 'adopting', 'nation', 'have', 'been', 'beat', 'death', 'many', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'other', 'words', 'Pathfinder', 'not', 'have', 'original', 'story', 'clich', 'eacute', 'factor', 'drawback', 'Not', 'only', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'preposterous', 'even', 'laughable', 'Native', 'Americans', 'spoke', 'perfect', 'English', 'Vikings', 'spoke', 'strange', 'language', 'subtitles', 'heard', 'people', 'laughed', 'theater', 'not', 'intended', 'filmmakers', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'unintentional', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'Where', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'Vikings', 'chasing', 'someone', 'sled', 'Once', 'again', 'get', 'good', 'actors', 'very', 'little', 'material', 'work', 'are', 'reduced', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'evil', 'Vikings', 'are', 'nothing', 'pushover', 'IQ', 'extremely', 'low', 'manage', 'cross', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'many', 'fall', 'prey', 'couple', 'Indian', 'warriors.Are', 'there', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'course', 'visuals', 'marvel', 'artistic', 'cinematography', 'very', 'surreal', 'vision', 'new', 'world', 'also', 'costume', 'design', 'especially', 'Vikings', 'have', 'peculiar', 'look', 'orcs', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'taller', 'action', 'silly', 'entertaining', 'movie', ""n't"", 'drag', 'all.The', 'Verdict', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'certain', 'Vikings', 'came', 'America', 'Columbus', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'Pathfinder', 'silly', 'action', 'film', 'boy', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'love', 'adopted', 'land', 'America', 'order', 'fulfill', 'destiny', 'had', 'fight', 'who', 'betrayed', 'child', 'Pathfinder', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'good', 'action', 'visuals', 'might', 'entertain']",N/A

Vikings were certainly as mean and nasty as , say, the Mongols, though I think for body count of innocent victims the Mongols would win hands ( feet, and heads ) down.After 15 years this boy remembers his native tongue perfectly.

Like maybe portable GPS gear?

1080771,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000R9U3AQ,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 4]","When ""Pathfinder"" hit theaters a few years ago, I wanted to see it very badly.  Unfortunately for me, it quietly came and went before I had the chance to see it.  I heard almost nothing about it after it left theaters and began to lose interest in viewing it.  Luckily for me, I managed to catch it on HBO awhile back and was instantly hooked.  I sought out a copy of the DVD (which I had actually skimmed over for a long time thinking that it wasn't worth it), and was happy to find an unrated version of the film.The story itself is rather simple.  A young Viking boy is abandoned by his father when he refuses to kill a ""savage"" child on a scavenging excursion in what would become the New World.  He is taken in by a North American tribe and raised as one their children.  Fifteen years pass and the young boy is still a part of the tribe.  He is called ""Ghost"" and gets along very well with his adopted family.  He isn't, however, given the status of ""Brave"" because he still cannot find out which world (Viking or Native American) he truly belongs to.  The opportunity to find his true path comes quickly when another raiding party of Vikings lands near his home and destroys the village.  From this point on, it becomes a story of survival for Ghost as he attempts to help his surviving tribe members escape to safety while he stays behind to take on the Vikings alone.Karl Urban (""Doom,"" ""Star Trek"") plays Ghost and does an excellent job of it.  He is joined by Moon Bloodgood (""Burn Notice,"" ""Eight Below"") as Starfire, Russell Means (""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""Pocahontas"") as Pathfinder and a nearly unrecognizable Clancy Brown (""Highlander,"" ""Carnivale"") as Gunnar, head of the Vikings.The cast do an incredible job of acting, particularly since there is very little dialogue in the film.  The natives speak English and the Vikings speak Icelandic.  However, you could easily watch this film with no audio and know exactly what is going on.For history buffs, you'll have to throw any and every fact you know about Vikings out of the window, as the producers intentionally utilized the Hollywood version of the Norsemen (and hockey pads) to provide familiarity for action fans.  Horses are also thrown into the mix, so that's another falsification that will eat away at you as well.The film is very violent.  The unrated version features more action and a bit more blood, but is otherwise the same as the version on HBO.The DVD comes with a few decent featurettes that range from the development of the story to the actual filming of the movie.  Also included is a very brief look into Clancy Brown who, in my opinion, has never really received the recognition he deserves for his film and television work.  Deleted scenes are also included.I believe that this film deserves a few more looks from action and adventure fans.  Granted, it lacks the so-called witty dialogue that litters most action films these days and actually takes a little time in developing the characters and plot, but it's a very good action film that shouldn't be ignored.I also think that fans of films such as ""Gladiator,"" ""Brotherhood of the Wolf,"" and gritty horror films such as ""Wolf Creek"" will enjoy this film.Highly underrated, highly recommended.",4,"A Violent, Brutal Wonder",1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,3243,"['When', 'Pathfinder', 'hit', 'theaters', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'wanted', 'see', 'very', 'badly', 'Unfortunately', 'quietly', 'came', 'went', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'heard', 'almost', 'nothing', 'left', 'theaters', 'began', 'lose', 'interest', 'viewing', 'Luckily', 'managed', 'catch', 'HBO', 'awhile', 'back', 'was', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'sought', 'out', 'copy', 'DVD', 'had', 'actually', 'skimmed', 'long', 'time', 'thinking', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'unrated', 'version', 'film.The', 'story', 'rather', 'simple', 'young', 'Viking', 'boy', 'abandoned', 'father', 'when', 'kill', 'savage', 'child', 'scavenging', 'excursion', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'New', 'World', 'taken', 'North', 'American', 'tribe', 'raised', 'one', 'children', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'pass', 'young', 'boy', 'still', 'part', 'tribe', 'called', 'Ghost', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'adopted', 'family', ""n't"", 'however', 'given', 'status', 'Brave', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'world', 'Viking', 'Native', 'American', 'truly', 'opportunity', 'find', 'true', 'path', 'quickly', 'when', 'raiding', 'party', 'Vikings', 'lands', 'home', 'village', 'point', 'story', 'survival', 'Ghost', 'help', 'surviving', 'tribe', 'members', 'escape', 'safety', 'take', 'Vikings', 'alone.Karl', 'Urban', 'Doom', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Ghost', 'excellent', 'job', 'joined', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'Eight', 'Below', 'Starfire', 'Russell', 'Means', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Pocahontas', 'Pathfinder', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Highlander', 'Carnivale', 'Gunnar', 'head', 'Vikings.The', 'cast', 'do', 'incredible', 'job', 'acting', 'particularly', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'film', 'natives', 'speak', 'English', 'Vikings', 'speak', 'Icelandic', 'However', 'could', 'easily', 'watch', 'film', 'audio', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'on.For', 'history', 'buffs', ""'ll"", 'have', 'throw', 'fact', 'know', 'Vikings', 'window', 'producers', 'intentionally', 'utilized', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Norsemen', 'hockey', 'pads', 'provide', 'familiarity', 'action', 'fans', 'Horses', 'are', 'also', 'thrown', 'mix', 'falsification', 'will', 'eat', 'away', 'well.The', 'film', 'very', 'violent', 'unrated', 'version', 'features', 'more', 'action', 'bit', 'more', 'blood', 'otherwise', 'same', 'version', 'HBO.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'decent', 'featurettes', 'range', 'development', 'story', 'actual', 'filming', 'movie', 'Also', 'included', 'very', 'brief', 'look', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'who', 'opinion', 'never', 'really', 'received', 'recognition', 'film', 'television', 'work', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'included.I', 'believe', 'film', 'few', 'more', 'looks', 'action', 'adventure', 'fans', 'Granted', 'so-called', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'most', 'action', 'films', 'days', 'actually', 'little', 'time', 'developing', 'characters', 'plot', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored.I', 'also', 'think', 'fans', 'films', 'such', 'Gladiator', 'Brotherhood', 'Wolf', 'gritty', 'horror', 'films', 'such', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film.Highly', 'underrated', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

1080774,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000R9U3AQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[50, 57]","The historical question is not whether the Vikings came to North America but rather how far South they came once they made it to Vinland (a Norse settlement has been found on the island of Newfoundland).  There must have been interactions between the Norsemen and the ""skrlingar"" (Native Americans), and while there is no evidence that the two races engaged in a violent confrontation it does make a neat idea for a movie, which is why we have the film ""Pathfinder: The Legend of the Ghost Warrior.""  Ghost is a young boy who is left behind after a previous Vikings raid and who grows up eighteen years later to be played by Karl Urban (Eomer inThe Lord of the Rings"" but also Julius Caesar on ""Xena Warrior Princess"").  When another Viking raiding party led by Gunnar  (Clancy Brown) attacks his village, Ghost leads the fight against the invaders, hoping not only to save his adopted people but also win the heart of  Starfire (Moon Bloodgood).Basically what he have here is ""Vikings and Indians"" instead of ""Cowboys and Indians.""  Couching the film in such terms, of course, is easily understood but not politically correct.  But if you think about the latter in contemporary sports terms, the idea of the Minnesota Vikings taking on the Cleveland Indians is certainly in the ballpark for a key dynamic of this film, which features armored warriors against people armed with essentially sticks and stones.  The idea of a war being waged in the New World a thousand years ago is pretty compelling: the concept trailer they shot to get the film produced makes that case quite nicely up to the point when the native warrior attacks the hulking Norseman and you see it is the Viking who has the ax and the lad in the buckskin is fighting with a sword.The genesis for this 2007 film is the 1987 Norwegian film ""Veiviseren"" (""Pathfinder""), which is based on a Sami legend.  The first full-length film in Sami, that movie was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.  This version, written by Laeta Kalogridis and directed by Marcus Nispel, takes the basic story idea of a warrior leading the Sami to victory against a horde of invading Chudes and transplants it from Finnmark to the New World.  The Sami become the nameless Native American people rather than the Beothuk people of Newfoundland and the Chudes are transformed into Vikings.My major problem with this film, quite frankly, is that the hero of this movie is white and the subtext is that if it were not for the kindhearted son of a Viking who was raised by Native Americans the Vikings who come back in Act II of this film would have killed ever native inhabitant of the continent.  Well, okay, that would not have happened unless the Vikings infected the local population with a disease that their immune systems could not handle, but you get the idea.  At least this movie allows the title character, played by Russell Means, to come up with the obvious strategy that a people armed with Stone Age weapons fighting on their own turf would use against three dragonships worth of Viking warriors, because that is what I really wanted this film to be about.""Pathfinder"" never tries to pass itself off as history, which is a legitimate approach, but a bit more realism would not have hurt.  The film was shot in British Columbia, which explains how they get from the ocean shore to snow capped mountains in a relatively short period of time, a direction dictated not by geography but because that is what happened in ""Veiviseren.""  What they should have done was take the premise of a people fighting back against armored invaders in general without being tied to the specifics of the earlier film.  Setting up the Vikings to be defeated on terrain and in weather more akin to the land from which they came ends up backfiring.Whenever possible the film relies on images more than dialogue, although they do not end up going the ""Quest for Fire"" route.  The color palette in the film favors the Vikings for most of the film, tending towards blue, black, white, and silver stressing night, cold, and metal.  Eventually these colors overwhelm the film and works against the basic contrast of the Vikings warriors in the lush green forests that I found compelling.  The Norsemen speak Icelandic, which is apparently close to the language of the Vikings, leaving English to be the language of Ghost and his tribe.I ended up rounding down on this film because in the final act of the film the Vikings enter the realm of being too stupid to live.  There is a scene that involves going around a frozen lake.  Gunnar sees this approach as being an attack on the courage of him and his men, insisting on walking across the ice.  At this point I turned to my daughter and said, ""Gee, if only they came from a land of ice and snow, and knew something about when not to cross a frozen lake.""  Besides, I like it when the good guys win a lot more than when the bad guys lose.",3,Interesting premise but what they end up doing with it is rather disappointing,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,4932,"['historical', 'question', 'not', 'Vikings', 'came', 'North', 'America', 'rather', 'how', 'far', 'South', 'came', 'once', 'made', 'Vinland', 'Norse', 'settlement', 'been', 'found', 'island', 'Newfoundland', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'interactions', 'Norsemen', 'skrlingar', 'Native', 'Americans', 'evidence', 'two', 'races', 'engaged', 'violent', 'confrontation', 'make', 'neat', 'idea', 'movie', 'why', 'have', 'film', 'Pathfinder', 'Legend', 'Ghost', 'Warrior', 'Ghost', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'left', 'previous', 'Vikings', 'raid', 'who', 'up', 'eighteen', 'years', 'later', 'be', 'played', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Eomer', 'inThe', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'also', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess', 'When', 'Viking', 'raiding', 'party', 'led', 'Gunnar', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'village', 'Ghost', 'fight', 'invaders', 'hoping', 'not', 'only', 'save', 'adopted', 'people', 'also', 'win', 'heart', 'Starfire', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', '.Basically', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'Vikings', 'Indians', 'instead', 'Cowboys', 'Indians', 'Couching', 'film', 'such', 'terms', 'course', 'easily', 'understood', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'think', 'latter', 'contemporary', 'sports', 'terms', 'idea', 'Minnesota', 'Vikings', 'taking', 'Cleveland', 'Indians', 'certainly', 'ballpark', 'key', 'dynamic', 'film', 'armored', 'warriors', 'people', 'armed', 'essentially', 'sticks', 'stones', 'idea', 'war', 'being', 'waged', 'New', 'World', 'thousand', 'years', 'ago', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'concept', 'trailer', 'shot', 'get', 'film', 'produced', 'case', 'quite', 'nicely', 'point', 'when', 'native', 'warrior', 'hulking', 'Norseman', 'see', 'Viking', 'who', 'ax', 'lad', 'buckskin', 'fighting', 'sword.The', 'genesis', '2007', 'film', '1987', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'Veiviseren', 'Pathfinder', 'based', 'Sami', 'legend', 'first', 'full-length', 'film', 'Sami', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'version', 'written', 'Laeta', 'Kalogridis', 'directed', 'Marcus', 'Nispel', 'basic', 'story', 'idea', 'warrior', 'leading', 'Sami', 'victory', 'horde', 'invading', 'Chudes', 'transplants', 'Finnmark', 'New', 'World', 'Sami', 'become', 'nameless', 'Native', 'American', 'people', 'rather', 'Beothuk', 'people', 'Newfoundland', 'Chudes', 'are', 'transformed', 'Vikings.My', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'quite', 'frankly', 'hero', 'movie', 'white', 'subtext', 'were', 'not', 'kindhearted', 'son', 'Viking', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'Native', 'Americans', 'Vikings', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'Act', 'II', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'ever', 'native', 'inhabitant', 'continent', 'Well', 'okay', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'Vikings', 'infected', 'local', 'population', 'disease', 'immune', 'systems', 'could', 'not', 'handle', 'get', 'idea', 'least', 'movie', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'Russell', 'Means', 'come', 'up', 'obvious', 'strategy', 'people', 'armed', 'Stone', 'Age', 'weapons', 'fighting', 'own', 'turf', 'would', 'use', 'three', 'dragonships', 'Viking', 'warriors', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'film', 'be', 'about', 'Pathfinder', 'never', 'pass', 'off', 'history', 'legitimate', 'approach', 'bit', 'more', 'realism', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'hurt', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'British', 'Columbia', 'how', 'get', 'ocean', 'shore', 'snow', 'capped', 'mountains', 'relatively', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'direction', 'dictated', 'not', 'geography', 'what', 'happened', 'Veiviseren', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'take', 'premise', 'people', 'fighting', 'back', 'armored', 'invaders', 'general', 'being', 'tied', 'specifics', 'earlier', 'film', 'Setting', 'up', 'Vikings', 'be', 'defeated', 'terrain', 'weather', 'more', 'akin', 'land', 'came', 'up', 'backfiring.Whenever', 'possible', 'film', 'relies', 'images', 'more', 'dialogue', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'Quest', 'Fire', 'route', 'color', 'palette', 'film', 'Vikings', 'most', 'film', 'tending', 'towards', 'blue', 'black', 'white', 'silver', 'stressing', 'night', 'cold', 'metal', 'Eventually', 'colors', 'overwhelm', 'film', 'basic', 'contrast', 'Vikings', 'warriors', 'lush', 'green', 'found', 'compelling', 'Norsemen', 'speak', 'Icelandic', 'apparently', 'close', 'language', 'Vikings', 'leaving', 'English', 'be', 'language', 'Ghost', 'tribe.I', 'ended', 'up', 'rounding', 'down', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'Vikings', 'enter', 'realm', 'being', 'too', 'stupid', 'live', 'scene', 'going', 'frozen', 'lake', 'Gunnar', 'approach', 'being', 'attack', 'courage', 'men', 'insisting', 'walking', 'ice', 'point', 'turned', 'daughter', 'said', 'Gee', 'only', 'came', 'land', 'ice', 'snow', 'knew', 'something', 'about', 'when', 'not', 'cross', 'frozen', 'lake', 'like', 'when', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'lot', 'more', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'lose']",N/A

When the Dragon Men return his new world will come undone...The movie is partly based on real events, i.e. the North American Viking colony of Vinland (1000-1100 AD), though most of it is pure, and quite enjoyable, fiction.With slight hints of the Last of the Mohicans, Apocalypto, and the 13th Warrior, the film is action pact and quite realistic when it comes to combat...Karl Urban, Moon Bloodgood, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again!The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the language, the music, and the costumes (!!!) are all wonderful!Very well written and very well presented, it allows for an adventure that will definitely provide for an evening's entertainment.In short, Pathfinder is a film you should seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 4.5 Stars",5,Here There Be Dragon Men!,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,1300,"['Pathfinder', 'back', 'Americas', 'centuries', 'arrival', 'Spaniards', '1492', 'film', 'sheds', 'light', 'one', 'exotic', 'Native', 'American', 'civilizations', 'screen', 'tale', 'young', 'Norse', 'boy', 'survived', 'Viking', 'raid', 'was', 'taken', 'Indians', 'When', 'Dragon', 'Men', 'return', 'new', 'world', 'will', 'come', 'undone', 'movie', 'partly', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'i.e', 'North', 'American', 'Viking', 'colony', 'Vinland', '1000-1100', 'AD', 'most', 'pure', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'fiction.With', 'slight', 'hints', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Apocalypto', '13th', 'Warrior', 'film', 'action', 'pact', 'quite', 'realistic', 'when', 'combat', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'rest', 'cast', 'have', 'truly', 'outdone', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'say', 'least', 'actors', 'exceptions', 'give', '100', '%', 'really', 'thus', 'providing', 'entertaining', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'plot', 'setting', 'dialogues', 'language', 'music', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Very', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'adventure', 'will', 'definitely', 'provide', 'evening', 'entertainment.In', 'short', 'Pathfinder', 'film', 'should', 'seriously', 'consider', 'adding', 'movie', 'collection', '4.5', 'Stars']",N/A

Sadly, the uber-idiotic scenario destroyed this film as completely as a raid of Norsemen against a Skraeling's village.Life of a strange looking child amongst an Indian tribe was by itself an occasion for some good cinema moments - but we hardly see anything about it. Then the whole idea of a contact between two so completely different cultures (Vikings and Indians) was another occasion - which was also ignored. Vikings are shown as hairy grunting monsters, interested only in killing and torture, as they take no prisoners and there is hardly anything worth plundering in Indian villages (in real history Vikings expeditions from Greenland came to Vinland mostly to look for timber). Indians by contrast are very noble and civilized, but they are also all completely hapless when facing the Norsemen - the only guy able to fight them seems to be Ghost (Karl Urban), the white child who is now an adult man. Also, excepted for Ghost, all Indians are idiots who let themselves lure in the most evident traps...There is virtually no conversations in this film, just an accumulation of action scenes, which are all the same - a Viking comes swinging and boom, Ghost kills him. Another Viking comes, and boom, Ghost kills him. Then some Indians are butchered by Vikings. Then boom, Ghost kills more Vikings. Etc, etc. There seems to be a love story between Ghost and Starfire, an Indian girl played by Moon Bloodgood (who by the way is half-White, half-Korean), but both actors play it in such a wooden way, that a couple of days after watching this film I already forgot that there even was a love story.As if all those things were not enough let's just stress here, that in the real history things were the exact opposite of what this film shows - the relentless hostility and agressivity of Skraelings forced Viking settlers (who were very few and who were farmers rather than raiders) to evacuate Vinland after only a brief attempt to settle there around year 1000. Later Greenland Vikings visited Vinland mostly to bring timber and hunt deer for meat and hides, as forests in Greenland were rare and the big game completely absent.It is amazing how bad is this film especially considering that it is a remake of a very original and much, much better Norwegian film &#34;Pathfinder&#34; (a.k.a. &#34;Ofelas&#34;), which very desservedly was nominated for Oscar of best Foreign Language film in 1988.There are some nice pictures of snowy mountains and this is the only good moment in this awful, horribly bad film which bored me almost to death.

The original is all in a Scandinavian language with English subtitles, but I promise you that this is not a detractor from the movie. I first saw the original in 1992 while posted to a remote outpost in the Sinai. The original Pathfinder was fast paced and to me after the first few minutes I didn't even realize I was reading subtitles.  I special order this movie on VHS as soon as I returned from the Sinai in 1993 and have been a fan ever since.  It's so good that even my three boys enjoyed watching it multiple times.Now, I enjoyed the 2007 version but not as much as the original. Being familiar with the story line I could just find it in the re-make.  For all intents and purposes though it's a different movie all together.

Nevertheless for those lovers of action movies as ""Rambo"", ""Conan"" or ""Beowulf & Grendel"" (as I am) it is good enough.One big plus is that it doesn't pretend to be ""reproducing historical facts"", just wants to show us a legend. Then it is fully admissible to show Vikings with horned helmets more like Conan's stuff, bigger dragon-boats and quite a lot of horses and senseless destruction of native's villages.The story is about a Viking boy lost in ship wreckage or something like that (it is not very clear what had happened) and rescued by a native woman after she sees a mysterious white animal (a horse).Eighteen years later this boy has been adopted by the tribe, but not fully accepted as a warrior and is named Ghost for his fair skin. When he is alone in the forest a second Viking invasion occurs devastating his village and when he comes back the pirate band tries to kill him. He escapes with a sword and is pursued ceaselessly by the tenacious seamen.Ghost is able to alert other village of the predators' presence. While the villagers escape Ghost engage in a Rambo sequence trying to deviate and decimate the marauders. The rest of the film is the chronicle of this colossal struggle.Play acting is quite convincing particularly Karl Urban as Ghost, Russell Means as Pathfinder and beautiful Moon Bloodgood as Starfire.Musical score due to Jonathan Elias underscore action scenes greatly.IMHO there is only one quite silly sequence when the Vikings insist in crossing a frozen lake when they should be more than aware of the dangers of doing so.

It's no wonder why these two movies were released on DVD the same day.OK, first of all, for those films that leaves people questioning the minds of the film-makers, I suggest watching the special features and/or listening to the commentary tracks on the DVDs before passing full judgement on the film in question.  These featurettes/commentaries often explain what the film-makers intended to get across with their film.So with this one, PATHFINDER, that is, we have, as previously stated, the film-makers taking semi-historical events and people and making a kind of ""what-if"" scenario in comic-book form to some extent.  And by that I mean they took artistic license with the way the Vikings are portrayed, but ironically, not so much in the way the Indians are.  So anyway, the film-makers set out to make this comic-book movie set in the late 800s A.D.  It takes the form of John Rambo in FIRST BLOOD, fighting Vikings instead of the local Sheriff Department.  They even said this in one of the featurettes.They also like I said, took liberties with the Vikings costumes.  They acknowledge that the Vikings really didn't wear horns on their helmets, in fact, Vikings really didn't wear helmets at all.  But they say so-what?  This is a comic-book portrayal of a ""what-if"" battle 1000 years ago, and it comes off quite believable really.The reason why I gave it (only) 4 stars is because of the way it was shot.  Too many/much dark scenes.  In other words, the cinemaphotography could have been better.  I find it hard to believe in a movie that always seems to take place at night when several days/months/years have passed.  Other than that, the film is done quite well.

As the movie opens, an Indian woman stumbles across a frightened little boy, the sole survivor seemingly of a Viking raiding party.  She takes him to her tribe where he is brought up as one of their own.

I have never seen such a lousy interpretation of history as this film hands us and, as the author of an historical novel about Vikings and Indians in North America circa 1050 AD (The King of Vinland's Saga), I am particularly qualified to comment.I spent a decade researching the Norse incursions into North America before undertaking my novel and can say with confidence that there is absolutely no reason to imagine any of the kind of horrific, horror film stuff portrayed in this movie was ever perpetrated by vikings on American shores. Setting aside for a second that all the evidence about the Norse suggests they did not wear horned helmets, as they are shown doing here, the film has them riding huge mounted steeds as they run down the hapless Indians.Considering how hard it was to get over to North America, even from nearby Greenland, in the small open ships they relied on, there is absolutely no reason to believe (let alone evidence) that they came here with horses. Indeed, even in the heyday of the vikings (which is actually MUCH earlier than the events portrayed here), the Norse, Danes and Swedes rarely sailed with horses at all. Sometimes they carried livestock, possibly including horses, in their knorrs (wide beamed trading vessels quite unlike their feared dragon ships) for settlement purposes, but viking raiders never brought their horses along for battle. Period. And they didn't fight from horseback either but, rather, dismounted and fought on foot in the much vaunted shield wall (among other formations).The vikings portrayed in this film are inhuman monsters who appear like ferocious automatons and whose sole aim is to exterminate the natives in the area so they can ""colonize"" the country -- it's someone's nightmarish view of ethnic cleansing circa the tenth or eleventh centuries. This, too is patently absurd. The real Norse who came here tried to trade and otherwise get on with the native population according to the actual saga record. Unfortunately, misunderstandings soon led to violence and the overwhelming numeric superiority of the natives made the difference as the locals drove them out. The Norse settlers were certainly guilty of contempt for the human beings they found living on American shores at times, and some of them were callously brutal (as in Thorvald Eiricsson's visit in the wake of his brother, Leif's, earlier expedition). But the idea of killing off the locals was unthinkable. There were way too few Norse out of Greenland (a very small outpost on the edge of the known European world) for them to even hope to accomplish that, let alone to need such a removal in order to make room for themselves.The Indians in this movie, too, are portrayed abominably. They are invariably shown as kind hearted, gentle souls who fall prey to the ferocity of the relentless viking monsters invading their shores. The poor Indians are taken entirely unawares by the cruelty and savagery of these invaders (who, as mentioned by others elsewhere, seem more like Klingons, or even Borg, from Star Trek episodes than they do actual Norsemen from the outer edges of Europe). There is not even a hint that the Indians were themselves quite formidable hunters and fighters, more than a match on their own turf for Europeans in an age before gunpowder. Steel swords and shields were an advantage for the Norse, to be sure, but not nearly as much as guns and cannon later proved to be.Moreover, we know from the record that many of the Indian tribes were quite fierce themselves and that those in the Iroquois/Pawnee/Aztec family (who appear to have been linguistically and culturally related despite the distances between them), for instance, were not averse to torturing and killing helpless enemies. They also engaged in slaving as readily as the Europeans who ultimately overran them in later times and were themselves often prone to a little ""ethnic cleansing"". The Europeans didn't have a monopoly on that and they certainly weren't horned helmeted humanoids looking to eradicate lesser species as this film makes the Norse out to have been.Overall this movie, though it is certainly fast-paced, is an utterly false and misleading interpretation of history. Though the cinematography is nice, despite its unrealistic nightmarish quality, the whole thing looks and feels like little more than a comic book come to life. Well, maybe that is what the filmmakers intended. But that is still no excuse to propagate such an impoverished and misleading view of actual history or to give us characters without any inner dimension at all.I spent years getting the facts for my novel right and, frankly, I was looking forward to this film when I first heard about it, especially because of the subject matter. But the dark, nightmarish, blood drenched vision it presents completely distorts history with a story that even lacks the semblance of reality as the Karl Urban character teaches himself the highest level of swordsmanship after having been separated from his ""Norse"" heritage for some 15 years since having been discovered as a boy, the lone survivor of his ship, by a sensitive, caring native American woman. In the boy's nightmarish recollections, he recalls his brutal viking father beating him mercilessly because he refused to use his sword to slay an Indian child as commanded. This too is simply nuts as the Norse loved and cherished their children no less than any other people. There's little reason to think that a Norse father, having brought his son along on a raid (even if raids on the North American coast like this weren't anachronisms, at best), would have then nearly beat him to death for failing to do his bidding. Or that the leader of the later expedition would kill one of his own men out of pique some 15 years later. Indeed, the number of vikings in his crew seem, on screen, to be inexhaustible so there's no reason for him to worry about killing a few if they get under his skin. But, of course, in reality that is ridiculous since, in a foreign land, far from home, the numbers you've got with you count. Moreover, Norse crews were notoriously democratic and followed their leaders not from fear but from a committment to common goals or personal loyalty. It's not easy to be loyal to a leader who murders his own men at the drop of a hat.Were there brutal Norsemen? Certainly. Were the vikings fierce and fearsome raiders? This is well known. But vikings never actually raided the coast of North America because there was nothing here to take, only land to settle, and vikings weren't settlers. When the Norse actually found North America it was, in fact, at the tail end of the viking age, the people who came here being farmers looking for better land than they had available in Greenland. The odds that any of them had had any real experience as sea raiding vikings were minute. This film does an injustice to the memory of the Norse and to those seeing it today because of its historic distortions and hopelessly thin storyline. I'm glad I missed it in the movies. I should have skipped it in DVD, too.SWM",1,Awful!,1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,7182,"['almost', 'never', 'totally', 'pan', 'films', 'books', 'take', 'one', 'deserving', 'exception', 'have', 'never',

Vikings vs. Indians about 700 years ago...in North America ... it's politically correct because we don't have Vikings bitching about how they were treated generations ago...Clancy Brown (aka Mr Krabs, aka Lex Luthor, aka under appreciated actor) growling out orders in ""Viking Speak"" ...Karl Urban; almost naked, running around in the forest so the teenage boy can convice his girlfriend to go with him to see this blockbuster...lots and lots or CGI blood which we won't spend much on ... huge plot holes like a thing with ""shiny skin"" that will ""cut through your spear"" one minute and kill everyone then it magically is known; via the 700-year-ago-smoke-signal-internet, that the proper term is a ""sword"" for the rest of the movie ... how do we know what a ""dragon"" is anyway since most of our folklore and spirituality is based on what we see in nature around us...the Indians will speak fluent English...the Vikings; who have almost the same amount of dialog as the Indians, will speak in a language that almost noone in our target audience will know, so it doesn't matter if Mr Krabs is swearing every other word in ""Viking Speak"" and a few people in on the joke will get a laugh; just like other movies with obscure languages to most of the target audience...etc, etc, etc...studio heads nod knowing it's not a bad idea; given what else we have to put out, and signs check.It's not Oscar worthy material, but it's got action and blood and Indians getting their heads cut off by white people... any movie with swords and battle axes and shields and spears and armor,will make money since ""Lord of the Rings"" and it's got other stuff, like action...and did I mention the cheap CGI blood and action? Oh yeah, there's 2 sorta action stars in the movie.I've gotta admit that I've liked Clancy Brown since ""Highlander"". Hearing that voice and hoping Lex Luthor might tell Superman that ""in Metropolis ... THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!"" Then cutt'n off the boyscout's head with a Kryptonite sword!!! I would definitely crap my pants to see that!!!I liked it though; just like I enjoyed ""Primeval"" and ""something Violet"" with Milla Jovavichysomething.

That being said, the latest cinematic endeavor from director Marcus Nispel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is one of the slowest moving action films ever made.When a filmmaker raises the number of frames that a film is photographed at, the result is the creation of a slow motion effect. While slow motion has been an inherent cinematic technique used in almost every genre, it seems to work best in small doses. The action in Pathfinder, a Viking versus Native American blood bath, should have been intense and ferocious. Instead, the director's insistence on having each battle flooded with slow motion makes waiting for the film's conclusion seem tedious and each and every shot drag monotonously.This is an absolute shame too, because in the right hands Pathfinder could have been a stunning epic. While the story is very reminiscent of last year's Apocalypto, making the film's delay from last September a good move on the part of Twentieth Century Fox, Nispel proves with Pathfinder that he has a knack for visuals and not much else. Had the action not moved at a snail's pace, the grating acting might have been forgivable, but alas it's not. Both flaws cause the film to meander from what appeared to be the path of a straight forward, over-the-top action movie.While the story should have been emotionally riveting, under the direction of Nispel, Karl Urban and his fellow cast members deliver some horribly wooden acting. Should Nispel have been able to drum up some emotion from his audience when Urban's character, Ghost, finds that his tribe has fallen prey to the pillaging Vikings from his past? Absolutely. Does he? Absolutely not.As a film, Pathfinder defines Hollywood mediocrity; as a highlight reel of Daniel Pearl's cinematography, the visuals are hauntingly beautiful and he just might want to show people with the sound muted. Shoddy computer graphics aside, just about every frame of Pathfinder is filled with stunning camera work, impressive and atmospheric lighting and gorgeous aesthetics, including monstrous character designs for the imposing Vikings. While Pearl has worked under the direction of Nispel before in the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, this film show's both filmmaker's prowess for visual beauty; in fact I dare compare some of the gorgeous shots to some of Ridley Scott's best work.What is nice about Pathfinder is that these stunning images are showcased beautifully with the film's overabundance of slow motion. Too bad it is the pace of these individual shots that kills the movie. What could have been ferocious and violent turned into a dull, poorly acted bore begging to ask this one solitary question: Just how did Pathfinder get so lost?-Joe Russo",3,Pathfinder Movie Review,1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,2896,"['Had', 'Pathfinder', 'been', 'allowed', 'run', 'normal', 'speed', 'twenty-four', 'frames', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'only', 'lasted', 'forty', 'five', 'minutes', 'even', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'long', 'being', 'said', 'latest', 'cinematic', 'endeavor', 'director', 'Marcus', 'Nispel', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'one', 'slowest', 'moving', 'action', 'films', 'ever', 'made.When', 'filmmaker', 'number', 'frames', 'film', 'photographed', 'result', 'creation', 'slow', 'motion', 'effect', 'slow', 'motion', 'been', 'inherent', 'cinematic', 'technique', 'used', 'almost', 'genre', 'work', 'best', 'small', 'doses', 'action', 'Pathfinder', 'Viking', 'versus', 'Native', 'American', 'blood', 'bath', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'intense', 'ferocious', 'Instead', 'director', 'insistence', 'having', 'battle', 'flooded', 'slow', 'motion', 'waiting', 'film', 'conclusion', 'seem', 'tedious', 'shot', 'drag', 'monotonously.This', 'absolute', 'shame', 'too', 'right', 'hands', 'Pathfinder', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stunning', 'epic', 'story', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'last', 'year', 'Apocalypto', 'making', 'film', 'delay', 'last', 'September', 'good', 'move', 'part', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Nispel', 'Pathfinder', 'knack', 'visuals', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Had', 'action', 'not', 'moved', 'snail', 'pace', 'grating', 'acting', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'forgivable', 'not', 'flaws', 'cause', 'film', 'meander', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'path', 'straight', 'forward', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'emotionally', 'riveting', 'direction', 'Nispel', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'fellow', 'cast', 'members', 'deliver', 'horribly', 'wooden', 'acting', 'Should', 'Nispel', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'drum', 'up', 'emotion', 'audience', 'when', 'Urban', 'character', 'Ghost', 'tribe', 'fallen', 'prey', 'pillaging', 'Vikings', 'past', 'Absolutely', 'Absolutely', 'film', 'Pathfinder', 'Hollywood', 'mediocrity', 'highlight', 'reel', 'Daniel', 'Pearl', 'cinematography', 'visuals', 'are', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'just', 'might', 'want', 'show', 'people', 'sound', 'muted', 'Shoddy', 'computer', 'graphics', 'aside', 'just', 'frame', 'Pathfinder', 'filled', 'stunning', 'camera', 'work', 'impressive', 'atmospheric', 'lighting', 'gorgeous', 'aesthetics', 'including', 'monstrous', 'character', 'designs', 'imposing', 'Vikings', 'Pearl', 'worked', 'direction', 'Nispel', '2003', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'remake', 'film', 'show', 'filmmaker', 'prowess', 'visual', 'beauty', 'fact', 'dare', 'compare', 'gorgeous', 'shots', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'best', 'work.What', 'nice', 'Pathfinder', 'stunning', 'images', 'are', 'showcased', 'beautifully', 'film', 'overabundance', 'slow', 'motion', 'Too', 'bad', 'pace', 'individual', 'shots', 'movie', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ferocious', 'violent', 'turned', 'dull', 'poorly', 'acted', 'bore', 'begging', 'ask', 'one', 'solitary', 'question', 'Just', 'how', 'did', 'Pathfinder', 'get', 'so', 'lost', '-Joe', 'Russo']",N/A

1080821,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000R9U3AQ,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 2]","Some pitches are completely foolproof that you couldn't screw them up if you tried. Vikings versus Native Americans is one of them, so credit where credit's due to director Marcus Nispel for turning Pathfinder into such a yawn. An incredibly loose remake of Nils Gaup's acclaimed 1987 Norwegian film relocated to America centuries before Columbus, it sees Karl Urban as the sole survivor of a previous Viking expedition who was adopted by a local tribe and now has to find out where he really belongs if he is to save them from a new group of unwanted Norse immigrants. The opening discovery of the Vikings wrecked ship is encouragingly atmospheric, but the film doesn't take long to disappoint. The script offers everything you need for a decent action film, but doesn't deliver characters you care about, and unfortunately the film is denied even a charismatic lead to fill the gaps with old-fashioned star power. Karl Urban makes for a particularly bland void at the film's center, playing his entire part like a very shy kid on his first day a school who doesn't really want to be noticed. He's matched by the anonymous villain of the piece. Clancy Brown's Viking is more a costume and a hairstyle with no room for anything else, his subtitled dialogue not adding authenticity (hardly in a priority in a film whose look is inspired by old pulp novel covers and Hells Angels movies) but making him a distant, underdeveloped adversary.So, everything hinges on the action scenes, but here Nispel offers lots of style but little panache. Backlit swamps, desaturated shorelines and algae green tints ensure that America looks like somewhere you wouldn't want to visit let alone fight for, while the action scenes look designed to be intercut with a particularly bad Heavy Metal group singing about thunder and plunder rather than as scenes in a movie. There's far too much slo-mo, which doesn't make action scenes more exciting but just makes them slow. Not that the film allows you to ever really get into the frequent action scenes. There's little sense of a journey or even of progressing from one scene to another, just a couple of perfunctory shots to get from one scene to the next as quickly as possible, and the fights are treated in the same perfunctory manner. This monotonous pacing ensures there are no highs and that no scene ever carries any real weight or is allowed to build to a climax: they just happen. The result is a surprisingly dreary movie that just drags on, though there is at least one unintentionally hysterically funny underwater DIALOGUE scene that plays so like something out of a Mel Brooks film you almost expect Russell Means to tell Urban to ""use the Schwartz."" A shame, because this could and should have been a great dumb action movie rather than a long slog to the end credits.There's a decent selection of extras - deleted scenes, featurettes, audio commentary and trailers - but they don't make the film any less dull.",2,Viking borefare,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,2957,"['pitches', 'are', 'completely', 'foolproof', 'could', ""n't"", 'screw', 'up', 'tried', 'Vikings', 'Native', 'Americans', 'one', 'so', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'director', 'Marcus', 'Nispel', 'turning', 'Pathfinder', 'such', 'yawn', 'incredibly', 'loose', 'remake', 'Nils', 'Gaup', 'acclaimed', '1987', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'relocated', 'America', 'centuries', 'Columbus', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'sole', 'survivor', 'previous', 'Viking', 'expedition', 'who', 'was', 'adopted', 'local', 'tribe', 'now', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'really', 'save', 'new', 'group', 'unwanted', 'Norse', 'immigrants', 'opening', 'discovery', 'Vikings', 'wrecked', 'ship', 'encouragingly', 'atmospheric', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'disappoint', 'script', 'everything', 'need', 'decent', 'action', 'film', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'characters', 'care', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'denied', 'even', 'charismatic', 'lead', 'fill', 'gaps', 'old-fashioned', 'star', 'power', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'particularly', 'bland', 'void', 'film', 'center', 'playing', 'entire', 'part', 'very', 'shy', 'kid', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'be', 'noticed', 'matched', 'anonymous', 'villain', 'piece', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Viking', 'more', 'costume', 'hairstyle', 'room', 'anything', 'else', 'subtitled', 'dialogue', 'not', 'adding', 'authenticity', 'hardly', 'priority', 'film', 'look', 'inspired', 'old', 'pulp', 'novel', 'covers', 'Hells', 'Angels', 'movies', 'making', 'distant', 'underdeveloped', 'adversary.So', 'everything', 'hinges', 'action', 'scenes', 'here', 'Nispel', 'lots', 'style', 'little', 'panache', 'Backlit', 'swamps', 'desaturated', 'shorelines', 'algae', 'green', 'tints', 'ensure', 'America', 'somewhere', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'visit', 'let', 'alone', 'fight', 'action', 'scenes', 'look', 'designed', 'be', 'intercut', 'particularly', 'bad', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'group', 'singing', 'thunder', 'plunder', 'rather', 'scenes', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'slo-mo', ""n't"", 'make', 'action', 'scenes', 'more', 'exciting', 'just', 'slow', 'Not', 'film', 'ever', 'really', 'get', 'frequent', 'action', 'scenes', 'little', 'sense', 'journey', 'even', 'progressing', 'one', 'scene', 'just', 'couple', 'perfunctory', 'shots', 'get', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'fights', 'are', 'treated', 'same', 'perfunctory', 'manner', 'monotonous', 'pacing', 'ensures', 'are', 'highs', 'scene', 'ever', 'real', 'weight', 'allowed', 'build', 'climax', 'just', 'happen', 'result', 'surprisingly', 'dreary', 'movie', 'just', 'least', 'one', 'unintentionally', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'underwater', 'DIALOGUE', 'scene', 'so', 'like', 'something', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'film', 'almost', 'expect', 'Russell', 'Means', 'tell', 'Urban', 'use', 'Schwartz', 'shame', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'dumb', 'action', 'movie', 'rather', 'long', 'slog', 'end', 'credits.There', 'decent', 'selection', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'trailers', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'less', 'dull']",N/A
1080822,A3AEWUVYMELPNG,B000R9U3AQ,V. Koehler,"[1, 2]","I found this movie to be a bit of a surprise, a good surprise. Where it is  probably not completely historically accurate to the facts presented, I was aware of the Native American tribe of indians from Minnesota that had a large number of blond, blue eyed members. Add that to the fact that amid being ruthless warriors, the Vikings were first class explorers. Stories that have a sudo historical back-drop I find interesting, as you take a leap of imagination into the story. The story moves right along starting with meeting Ghost as a little boy and following him along as he walks his path toward becoming a brave. It is during this time you learn that he is not really accepted, nor is he ever really likely to be, as he is from both worlds.We learn that he has not really made peace with the fact and that of course is what he must do. I totally bonded with Ghost, I totally understood where he was coming from. From that point on our characters are flung into chaos. The Pathfinder declares that Ghost has not yet earned the right to become a brave which in turn sends he on what I believe to be his mystery walk. He stikes off on his own saying goodbye to the only family he has known. Of course disaster stikes and the Vikings have not only come back but they attack savagely and brutally. Please note that if violence offends or bothers you please skip this movie it only gets more pervasive through out. This brings Ghost back to find most of his family and tribe slaughtered, and his father hacked down in front of him. It is a nice touch that Ghost cries over his dead mother and finding his dead sisters' doll, it makes us the audience have to relate to Ghost as a human being which is not usually the way that it is in action movies. From this point forward vengeance with a capital V becomes Ghost's path kill as many as he can and die trying to kill even more. Brutal, savage, fast paced is what this movie becomes and you can not help become elated as the bad guys get killed. Though we do have a love triangle through out the first half of the movie so do not be fooled into thinking that this is only a slice and dice of the baddies type movie. Karl Urban and Moon Bloodgood are very believeable together. Also the Pathfinder joins them on this mission or maybe that should be folly, so there is a generous sprinkling of Native American mysticism added to the mix. The Vikings are pretty much presented as mindless killing machines not anything more of them is presented which is a shame, as there is a lot more to vikings than that. I liked Clancy Brown much better in Highlander, he was able to create the Kurgan and make him his own. In this movie it was like they said be a bad a__ Viking and that was what he did, he didn't seem to put his own spin on it. I could be wrong about that but to me that was how it seemed.Come on Clancy you can play such a good bad guy show us your evil side. The scenery is spectacular and is used well to enhance the story. I throughly enjoyed Karl Urban's portrayal of Ghost. I could really relate and feel for his character, a tortured loner struggling to come to terms with his own past, so he can finally move his own life forward while at the same time having to deal with the multitude of problems that the Vikings have created for him. The physical side of his role is an equal joy to watch. His sword work is excellent as well as the fight scences, but then would you expect less of E'omer. Lord of the Rings was a good training ground for action adventure and he put into play all that he honed on Lord of the Rings.

1080823,ATQTLLURVJA60,B000R9U3AQ,W. Christie,"[9, 15]","I shudder when I conceive of the type person who considers this an excellent film! This film is non-ending gore, bloodshed and butchery from start to finish. Since I don't usually consider this my normal type of entertainment, I found it shocking and disgusting. On a more subliminal level, I found it also hilarious, a perfect candidate for that old Comedy Central TV show ""Mystery Theater 3000"" (where a film was shown while being amusingly panned by an audience).Typical Scene 1: Peaceful Indians living in a paradise of peace and joy devoid of human emotions of envy, malice, hate or competition. When they are called upon to defend themselves, they woop it up like 1950's TV Indians attacking a wagon train, and carry sticks.Typical Scene 2: Vikings in stereotypical Lord of the Rings Orc attire arrive and butcher every Indian, dog, squirrel and butterfly in sight, since they live to kill. Lots of blood spurts from Indians, and there seems to be a reason for us to see women and small children beheaded (Spurt more Blood!!) and old people run down by horses (Get that old man with the walker, boys!). Later, an Indian is shown being burnt alive. All in a day's work for those psychopathic Vikings! I also kept wondering where the Vikings hwere all coming from. I kept expecting to see the Queen Mary or a modern military troop convoy ship (like in in the Middle East) in the harbor. Instead, this horde of Vikings in full battle gear, many on horses, along with attack dogs and tons of testosterone all supposedly came to the US shores in 3 flimsy little boats that looked like they wouldn't really survive a turbulent hot tub!Typical Scene 3: White Boy Hero of the Indian meets up over and over and over and over (ad nauseum) with the evil Vikings, and a blood bath usually ensues. White boy butchers some Vikings, which are quickly replaced by an inexhaustible supply. Vikings, who in this movie have no purpose but to kill, are easily dispatched by a white Indian boy with a sword and a shield he swiped from a dead Viking.Typical Scene 4: White Boy Hero survives events that would kill any other human in history. For example, he falls through the ice of a lake into the frigid water. Hypothermia does not set in for some reason, and he is pulled from the water long after he should have died, and struts off just wearing his chic designer Indian fur wrap. After suffering more blows than most stock cars ever experience, this hardy fellow was still full of vigor and the muscles were rippling under the 21st century vision of a cool Indian macho man costume. My goodness! In the end, he even survives an avalanche that kills all the Vikings ! Oops! I gave away the ending. Sorry about that. Well, if you are like me, by the end you just want the carnage to end.This is a hilarious and awful movie. Dreadful is another word that comes to mind. Thanks, Muscular White Boy, for saving the poor Indians from the Viking monsters! I am sure the descendents of both the Indians and the Vikings are planning law suits for defamation!",1,"Just an excuse for non-ending gore, bloodshed and butchery",1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,3038,"['shudder', 'when', 'conceive', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'excellent', 'film', 'film', 'non-ending', 'gore', 'bloodshed', 'butchery', 'start', 'finish', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'consider', 'normal', 'type', 'entertainment', 'found', 'shocking', 'disgusting', 'more', 'subliminal', 'level', 'found', 'also', 'hilarious', 'perfect', 'candidate', 'old', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'TV', 'show', 'Mystery', 'Theater', '3000', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'being', 'amusingly', 'panned', 'audience', '.Typical', 'Scene', '1', 'Peaceful', 'Indians', 'living', 'paradise', 'peace', 'joy', 'devoid', 'human', 'emotions', 'envy', 'malice', 'hate', 'competition', 'When', 'are', 'called', 'defend', 'woop', '1950', 'TV', 'Indians', 'attacking', 'wagon', 'train', 'carry', 'sticks.Typical', 'Scene', '2', 'Vikings', 'stereotypical', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Orc', 'attire', 'arrive', 'butcher', 'Indian', 'dog', 'squirrel', 'butterfly', 'sight', 'live', 'kill', 'Lots', 'blood', 'spurts', 'Indians', 'there', 'be', 'reason', 'see', 'women', 'small', 'children', 'beheaded', 'Spurt', 'more', 'Blood', 'old', 'people', 'run', 'down', 'horses', 'Get', 'old', 'man', 'walker', 'Later', 'Indian', 'shown', 'being', 'burnt', 'alive', 'day', 'work', 'psychopathic', 'Vikings', 'also', 'kept', 'wondering', 'where', 'Vikings', 'hwere', 'coming', 'kept', 'expecting', 'see', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'modern', 'military', 'troop', 'convoy', 'ship', 'Middle', 'East', 'harbor', 'Instead', 'horde', 'Vikings', 'full', 'battle', 'gear', 'many', 'horses', 'attack', 'dogs', 'tons', 'testosterone', 'supposedly', 'came', 'US', 'shores', '3', 'flimsy', 'little', 'boats', 'looked', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'survive', 'turbulent', 'hot', 'tub', 'Typical', 'Scene', '3', 'White', 'Boy', 'Hero', 'Indian', 'up', 'over', 'over', 'over', 'over', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'evil', 'Vikings', 'blood', 'bath', 'usually', 'White', 'boy', 'butchers', 'Vikings', 'are', 'quickly', 'replaced', 'inexhaustible', 'supply', 'Vikings', 'who', 'movie', 'have', 'purpose', 'kill', 'are', 'easily', 'dispatched', 'white', 'Indian', 'boy', 'sword', 'shield', 'swiped', 'dead', 'Viking.Typical', 'Scene', '4', 'White', 'Boy', 'Hero', 'events', 'would', 'kill', 'other', 'human', 'history', 'example', 'ice', 'lake', 'frigid', 'water', 'Hypothermia', 'not', 'set', 'reason', 'pulled', 'water', 'long', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'off', 'just', 'wearing', 'chic', 'designer', 'Indian', 'fur', 'wrap', 'suffering', 'more', 'blows', 'most', 'stock', 'cars', 'ever', 'experience', 'hardy', 'fellow', 'was', 'still', 'full', 'vigor', 'muscles', 'were', 'rippling', '21st', 'century', 'vision', 'cool', 'Indian', 'macho', 'man', 'costume', 'goodness', 'end', 'even', 'avalanche', 'Vikings', 'Oops', 'gave', 'away', 'ending', 'Sorry', 'Well', 'are', 'end', 'just', 'want', 'carnage', 'end.This', 'hilarious', 'awful', 'movie', 'Dreadful', 'word', 'mind', 'Thanks', 'Muscular', 'White', 'Boy', 'saving', 'poor', 'Indians', 'Viking', 'monsters', 'am', 'sure', 'descendents', 'Indians', 'Vikings', 'are', 'planning', 'law', 'suits', 'defamation']",N/A

Its just OK, not bad, not good.  Very Bloody.  I was hoping it would be a bit historic, which it was, but come on, Do all viking really sound like brutes.  And the action was predictable.  Finally, what the heck did these vikings have to gain buy hunting down these indians? Death. They didn't keep anything in the villiages in this film, they didn't use them as slaves, they didn't even use the women...not that I am for that kind of action, but I just could not figure out why these dumb brutes were stumbling around this frozen country risking death for one Crazed guy, were they really that stupid.  I mean, they managed to sail across uncharted waters in those simple boats and live, they had to have some brains.  Anyway, I guess if you take the thinking out of it, there was decent action, and it was a good try at a story, just didn't capture me.  So rent this one and save a couple of dollars.

1080825,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000R9U3AQ,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[7, 8]","Pathfinder (Legend of the Ghost warrior) is a film that I have to say would have to be an acquired taste. Loosely based on the Graphic novel published by Dark Hose comics, upon its production, it was intended to be a ""straight to DVD"" feature. However, with the success of Frank Miller's ""300""(another comic based epic), the studio decided to capitalize and gave it a shot in theaters. ""Pathfinder"" didn't enjoy the success of ""300"" though.The movie's timeline is set a few years before Columbus, somewhere in early North America. Our tale begins when a 10-year old Norwegian boy is found by a Native-American woman. Abandoned by his Viking brethren because of his refusal to slay a mother & child, the boy is taken in by the woman's tribe. Raised in the ways of the tribe, the boy oftentimes is still regarded as an outcast. Fifteen years have passed, the boy's Viking brethren (called ""Dragon people"" by the natives) has resurfaced to once again ""pillage and plunder"", in their path is the village he spent most of his childhood. The boy, now in his prime, must exact vengeance upon his former sires for his abandoment and to protect the life he has grown to cherish. Karl Urban( DOOM)plays the lead role and the beautiful Moon Bloodgood (Eight Below) plays his love interest. Clancy Brown plays the leader of the Vikings.PATHFINDER is a hard film to judge. There are a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies, much of the film's main premise may depend on the viewer's imagination and interpretation(I did consider it a fantasy film). I suppose it would be easier to put one and two together if you managed to have read the Dark Horse comic, but I believe a movie should be able to stand on its own for the benefit of viewers who haven't seen the comic version. Details and motivation are put to the back burner here, as the supposed details of the so-mentioned ""prophecy"" are a bit blurry (my personal take is that the tribe prophecised a pale skinned warrior, much like the white horse), the Viking's motivation for the massacre (my take is that the movie depends on the ""Berserker"" reputation of the Northsmen--ok, I'll buy that.) and exactly how the lead character (Karl Urban) learned how to use a broadsword with nobody to teach him(perhaps because of his natural ""Viking blood"", a bit far-fetched, don't you think? or maybe he learned from childhood--hmm, a child wielding a heavy sword?). The Indian tribe are often mentioned as savages with NO knowledge of the workings of the sword that contradicts the idea that one who grew up among the Indians can learn the use of a such a blade. It was also mentioned that the Northsmen have no knowledge of the tribes' ""spring season"" and snowy terrain, how could that be, when they know how to use sleds? That's the movie's main weakness: it contradicts itself at times.Now for the action; while watching the 1st-2nd acts of ""Pathfinder"", the film ""APOCALYPTO"" came to mind, especially during the chase sequences. When I saw the scene with the frozen lake, Bruckheimer's ""King Arthur"" came to mind. Not to say that the director (Marcus Nispel) is stealing gimmicks, it's just that it shows that the director likes action movies. Even the Vikings have equal parts ""CONAN"" mixed with ""PREDATOR"" look. The characters are flat and the acting is a bit bland.  There is ABSOLUTELY no sense of ""society"" between the warring sides. The movie definitely needed more depth to allow people to have a sense of community so that viewer can have an investment with the tribes' fate.To its credit, the costumes are decent and set designs are quite well done. Put realism and spirit in the back of your mind, and it seems to be a decent ""straight-forward"" action popcorn flick. There is a lot of ""hacking & slashing"" with the usual bloody ""splatterfest"" that I'm quite certain people who like these types of films and not expecting much may find it diverting.PICTURE/AUDIO: 2.35 Anamorphic widescreen enhanced. The PQ is very nice and free of dirt and grain. Colors are a bit bland but it looked intentional to create the atmosphere. The transfer is sharp with solid black levels. 5.1 Dolby/5.1 DTS English track is very powerful. The 5 channels of sound is very crisp.EXTRAS: 7 DELETED SCENES--Director's COMMENTARY--7 shorts about the film's production.Now the keeper: TIE-IN with the graphic novel version of PATHFINDER. Needless to say, the comic version is a lot stronger than the film.CLOSING REMARKS:PATHFINDER is a watchable(if passable), brainless action movie. Equal parts ""TARZAN"" AND equal parts ""CONAN"". I really wanted to like it but in the end, the empty plot just made me feel that it would have made more sense as a ""direct to DVD"" popcorn snooze, rather than having the studio pretending it was a ""high-end"" release. It wasn't laughingly bad, but people will have to come in with the right expectations.RENT IT!

1080826,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000R9U3AQ,Wuchak,"[2, 3]","Released in 2007, ""Pathfinder"" relays the story of Vikings coming to North America hundreds of years before Columbus and bringing death & destruction to the Native Americans. One of the natives, Ghost (Karl Urban) is actually a Viking by blood, a survivor of the previous Viking expedition, brought up by the Indians. Understandably, Ghost denies his Viking heritage and fights for the natives.I thought this was going to be some low-budget Syfy flick but, no, ""Pathfinder"" was a theatrical release with stellar production values. The first thing I noticed was that the director was Marcus Nispel, who went on to direct the 2011 version of ""Conan the Barbarian.""As others have noted, there are some derivative bits sprinkled throughout, e.g. ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Rambo: First Blood, Part 2,"" ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" etc., but it's unique enough to embrace and enjoy.The villains are the Vikings, who are depicted as cartooney inhuman monsters, whereas the natives are virtuous.  This brings up the whole nature vs. nurture issue as Ghost is of Viking heritage but because he's brought up by the spiritual natives he isn't corrupted by the Vikings' ways. This suggests that evil or immorality is socially spread.Russell Means, who played Chingachgook in ""Last of the Mohicans,"" is on hand as the elder Pathfinder. It's great to see him still truckin' along at almost seventy years old.The film was shot in British Columbia in mostly forest settings, but with occasional mountains that don't look anything like the Northeast. Despite this flaw, ""Pathfinder"" is a visually striking film from beginning to end, and I don't just mean the scenery. Nispel knows how to make a spectacularly good-looking film, that's for sure. In fact, it's so awe-inspiring it's worth the price of admission.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the story. Everything's there for a quality story, but somehow it's just not all that captivating like ""Last of the Mohicans"" or the original ""Conan the Barbarian,"" although it's not bad, and it's certainly better than ""Rambo 2."" Some complain about the extreme violence but it's definitely not a case of violence for the sake of violence as there are a lot of dramatic valleys to contrast the violent highs. Depth is hinted at, many times, I just wish there was more.GRADE: B",4,Incredibly good-looking action/adventure flick,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,2307,"['Released', '2007', 'Pathfinder', 'story', 'Vikings', 'coming', 'North', 'America', 'hundreds', 'years', 'Columbus', 'bringing', 'death', 'destruction', 'Native', 'Americans', 'One', 'natives', 'Ghost', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'actually', 'Viking', 'blood', 'survivor', 'previous', 'Viking', 'expedition', 'brought', 'up', 'Indians', 'Understandably', 'Ghost', 'Viking', 'heritage', 'fights', 'natives.I', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'low-budget', 'Syfy', 'flick', 'Pathfinder', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'stellar', 'production', 'values', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'director', 'was', 'Marcus', 'Nispel', 'who', 'went', 'direct', '2011', 'version', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'are', 'derivative', 'bits', 'sprinkled', 'e.g', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Rambo', 'First', 'Blood', 'Part', '2', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'etc.', 'unique', 'enough', 'embrace', 'enjoy.The', 'villains', 'are', 'Vikings', 'who', 'are', 'depicted', 'cartooney', 'inhuman', 'monsters', 'natives', 'are', 'virtuous', 'up', 'whole', 'nature', 'vs.', 'nurture', 'issue', 'Ghost', 'Viking', 'heritage', 'brought', 'up', 'spiritual', 'natives', ""n't"", 'corrupted', 'Vikings', 'ways', 'evil', 'immorality', 'socially', 'spread.Russell', 'Means', 'who', 'played', 'Chingachgook', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'hand', 'elder', 'Pathfinder', 'great', 'see', 'still', 'truckin', 'along', 'almost', 'seventy', 'years', 'old.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'British', 'Columbia', 'mostly', 'forest', 'settings', 'occasional', 'mountains', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'Northeast', 'flaw', 'Pathfinder', 'visually', 'striking', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'scenery', 'Nispel', 'how', 'make', 'spectacularly', 'good-looking', 'film', 'sure', 'fact', 'so', 'awe-inspiring', 'price', 'admission.Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'story', 'Everything', 'quality', 'story', 'somehow', 'just', 'not', 'captivating', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'original', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'not', 'bad', 'certainly', 'better', 'Rambo', '2', 'complain', 'extreme', 'violence', 'definitely', 'not', 'case', 'violence', 'sake', 'violence', 'are', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'valleys', 'contrast', 'violent', 'highs', 'Depth', 'hinted', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'more.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

There wasn't a single ounce of story driven content on the screen.  There was maybe 5 words spoken in the entire film, and there was no reason behind anything that anyone did.  You feel absolutely nothing for any of the characters. O wait, I felt something.  I was hoping everyone would just die so the movie would end.  But no, it kept going on and on and on, just showing more Viking deaths and killings, but getting nowhere in the process.""Lets make a movie with no story, and we can throw in random, choppy ""fight"" sequences to make up for it!""  That's probably what the director was thinking when creating this movie. Too bad the fighting scenes are terrible.  The editing is terrible. One second the characters are over here attacking a Viking, the very next shot has them in a entirely different scene fighting someone else.  Did I mention there is no story behind all this?  It's just a montage of random killings. There is also no logic to back it up either.  ""Let us climb onto a mountain pass, and lets tie ourselves together, so if one falls, we all fall!""  You'll no what I mean when you see it (although I highly, HIGHLY recommend you don't waste your money AND time).So to end this review of a worthless, terrible, despicable and time-wasting movie, I will again say there is no story.  Only random, gory deaths that had nothing to do with anything. I again recommend you skip this, unless you really enjoy films with absolutely no story and lots of cheesy, laughable (although they were going for the opposite effect) deaths.",1,Viking Epic?

The Vikings are portrayed as brutal marauders, who ironically slaughter the Native Americans whom they consider 'savages'. It doesn't take too long to figure out that it is the Vikings who are the true savages.The main character is a Viking who had been adopted into an Indian tribe as a young boy and how he struggles to battle his inner demons whilst striving to prove that he is equally capable as the other braves of a leadership position in his tribe.There isn't too much dialogue in the movie which is just as well. The story is pretty basic, and the action & battle sequences are credibly done. My only grouse is that some parts of the plot seemed illogical -the Norsemen being forced to rely on the Pathfinder to find their way back to the coast in bad winter weather [being who they are, this shouldn't have been the case].But, it was entertaining and the battle sequences made for cringe-inducing viewing.
