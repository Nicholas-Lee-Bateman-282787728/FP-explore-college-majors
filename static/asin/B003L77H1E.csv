The problem is that over the last two seasons the writers have become more interested in theme episodes and guest stars than what made this series awesome. Watch this season and ask yourself ""When was the last time Shawn had one of those psychic episodes where he shakes all over the place and messes up someone's hair?"" The physical comedy is gone. So are the pineapple references and a lot of the psychic detective work that we have come to love. Now, a special guest star will come along and try to outwit Shawn, or Shawn and Gus will go to Twin Peaks for a theme episode with even more guest stars. Oh, and say good bye to the sexual tension between Shawn and Juliet. Did the writers learn nothing from Moonlighting?I still love Psych, but this season (and part of Season 4) depart from what made the series great. I want to see less guest stars, less of Henry, and more of the case work, physical comedy and workplace tension that made the series great.

1353435,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B003L77H1E,Brent Butler,"[40, 49]","We've enjoyed Psych since the first episode. I'm sure you know the backstory. A policeman's son who was trained to be observant during his youth notices a few clues on TV coverage of a crime scene. When he phones in his tips, he makes himself a person of interest in the case. To dodge becoming a full-fledged suspect, he makes up a story about being psychic, and the show is born.For five years we've followed the merry adventures of Shawn and Gus as they catch murderers, taunt ""Lassie"", ogle girls, and drop pop culture references that at times go well beyond their ages. LOLI thought that seasons three and four arguably had become a little stale. Not so stale that we didn't still enjoy and laugh at the shows, but they at least weren't as surprising in the mysteries and clever dialogue as when the show was brand new. Perhaps Shawn's antics when he went into a fake psychic episode had begun to wear thin. I think the creative forces behind the show also came to that conclusion, as in season five Shawn is more disposed to calmly putting his fingers to his temple to report a ""psychic clue"", rather than launch into hysterical dialogue and action.Whatever the case, the show came roaring back in season five with some of the very best episodes of the entire series. Highlights:""Extradition II"", with Cary Elwes as the suave and super skilled thief Pierre Despereaux, was inspired.""In Plain Fright"" puts Shawn and Gus at odds with virtually everyone when Shawn sees a murder on a Halloween ride at the local amusement park, but the absence of the body hinders his desire to investigate and to call in backup.""Viagra Falls"", where Shawn and Gus alternately team up with and contend with two retired detectives when a closed case regains life, is a hilarious take on what happens when a set of active ""buddy cops"" get along in years.""Shawn 2.0"" introduces a brilliant criminal profiler with skills that rival, and possibly exceed, Shawn's own.""Dual Spires"" has a mysterious message drawing Shawn and Gus to a small town decidedly off the beaten path. The parallel to Twin Peaks will leave you laughing for most of the episode.""We'd Like to Thank the Academy"" has Shawn and Gus being sent to the Police Academy to learn correct police procedures. They immediately get their instructor (a older and nice looking Ralph Macchio) put on suspension, and dredge up an amusing Top Gun moment when Juliet is then put in charge of the class.""Yin 3 in 2D"", while funny in the normal Psych way, is also chilling as they once again are faced with a battle of wits with the brilliant clue leaving serial killer, Yin.In this season, we are also treated to a couple of the periodic alternate theme song variations, each of which is clever and funny. The closing credit outtakes also seem to be a cut above in season five, cracking us up every week.All seasons of this series are highly recommended.",5,A great comeback year,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,2887,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Psych', 'first', 'episode', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'backstory', 'policeman', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'trained', 'be', 'observant', 'youth', 'few', 'clues', 'TV', 'coverage', 'crime', 'scene', 'When', 'tips', 'person', 'interest', 'case', 'dodge', 'becoming', 'full-fledged', 'suspect', 'up', 'story', 'being', 'psychic', 'show', 'born.For', 'five', 'years', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'merry', 'adventures', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'catch', 'murderers', 'taunt', 'Lassie', 'ogle', 'girls', 'drop', 'pop', 'culture', 'times', 'go', 'well', 'ages', 'LOLI', 'thought', 'seasons', 'three', 'four', 'arguably', 'had', 'become', 'little', 'stale', 'Not', 'so', 'stale', 'did', ""n't"", 'still', 'enjoy', 'laugh', 'shows', 'least', 'were', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'mysteries', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'brand', 'new', 'Perhaps', 'Shawn', 'antics', 'when', 'went', 'fake', 'psychic', 'episode', 'had', 'begun', 'wear', 'thin', 'think', 'creative', 'forces', 'show', 'also', 'came', 'conclusion', 'season', 'five', 'Shawn', 'more', 'disposed', 'calmly', 'putting', 'fingers', 'temple', 'report', 'psychic', 'clue', 'rather', 'launch', 'hysterical', 'dialogue', 'action.Whatever', 'case', 'show', 'came', 'roaring', 'back', 'season', 'five', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'Highlights', 'Extradition', 'II', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'suave', 'super', 'skilled', 'thief', 'Pierre', 'Despereaux', 'was', 'inspired', 'Plain', 'Fright', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'odds', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'when', 'Shawn', 'murder', 'Halloween', 'ride', 'local', 'amusement', 'park', 'absence', 'body', 'desire', 'investigate', 'call', 'backup', 'Viagra', 'Falls', 'where', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'alternately', 'up', 'contend', 'two', 'retired', 'detectives', 'when', 'closed', 'case', 'life', 'hilarious', 'take', 'what', 'when', 'set', 'active', 'buddy', 'cops', 'get', 'years', 'Shawn', '2.0', 'introduces', 'brilliant', 'criminal', 'profiler', 'skills', 'rival', 'possibly', 'exceed', 'Shawn', 'own', 'Dual', 'Spires', 'mysterious', 'message', 'drawing', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'small', 'town', 'decidedly', 'beaten', 'path', 'parallel', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'will', 'leave', 'laughing', 'most', 'episode', ""'d"", 'Thank', 'Academy', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'being', 'sent', 'Police', 'Academy', 'learn', 'correct', 'police', 'procedures', 'immediately', 'get', 'instructor', 'older', 'nice', 'looking', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'put', 'suspension', 'dredge', 'up', 'amusing', 'Top', 'Gun', 'moment', 'when', 'Juliet', 'then', 'put', 'charge', 'class', 'Yin', '3', '2D', 'funny', 'normal', 'Psych', 'way', 'also', 'chilling', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'faced', 'battle', 'wits', 'brilliant', 'clue', 'leaving', 'serial', 'killer', 'Yin.In', 'season', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'couple', 'periodic', 'alternate', 'theme', 'song', 'variations', 'clever', 'funny', 'closing', 'credit', 'outtakes', 'also', 'seem', 'be', 'cut', 'season', 'five', 'cracking', 'up', 'week.All', 'seasons', 'series', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended']",Psych: The Complete Fifth Season

1353443,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B003L77H1E,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[101, 110]","We've been with fake psychic Shawn Spencer and his long-suffering buddy Burton Guster for five years, but this hilarious mystery-comedy shows no signs of slowing down. ""Psych Season 5"" has some new additions to the plot -- mainly in Shawn's love life -- but most of the time it's the usual whirl of bizarre crimes and quirky solutions.Ever since Henry was put in charge of police consultants, work has been scarce. So Shawn (James Roday) elbows his way into the case of a Chinese diplomat's missing daughter... and ends up mired in the Triads, martial-arts, and a very unusual romance. And that was actually the NORMAL case.As the season goes on, Shawn and Gus must deal with alien abductions, a professional profiler, a gang of prison escapees, partner-swapping, gigolo deaths, a pair of retired cops, a spy who's been framed, a dead body in a haunted house, an art thief determined to do one last job, a framed polar bear, and a stint at the police academy. Finally, Shawn and Gus do battle with Mr. Yin one last time, over the life of a college student -- and see his true face.Best parts of the season: the boys take a trip to ""Dual Spires"" (Twin Peaks in all but name); and after Shawn botches an important case, he has a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" experience where a grouchy Tony Cox shows him what Santa Barbara would be like if he hadn't returned.It's entirely possibly that ""Psych Season 5"" is, if not the best season so far, then certainly one of the best. Fortunately creator Steve Franks is sticking to the old adage: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" and this season doesn't deviate from what works -- there's still lots of comedy, spoofery, silly dialogue (""That would mean we're at war with the machines!"") and enjoyable mysteries.The writers deftly juggle the funny-sounding plot twists (nunchuk-wielding nerd! Cinnamon festival!), and cram it with endless pop culture references, from Michael Jackson to Percy Jackson, Twin Peaks to ""Disaster Movie."" But the best aspect of ""Psych"" continues to be its kooky dialogue (""What are you guys, UFO chasers?"" ""Nothing as ridiculous as that. We're psychic detectives"").But this season has a startling development in Shawn's love life. After four-and-a-half seasons of dancing around Shawn and Juliet's mutual attraction, they finally quit messing around. Don't worry -- the romance takes a backseat to the mysteries. The focus is still on Shawn and Gus's strong friendship, and Hill and Roday are still brilliant at depicting the weird, wacky and wild.And the supporting cast still does brilliant work -- Maggie Lawson's Juliet struggles with the aftermath of her near-death experience, and Timothy Ormundson's Lassiter acquires a new hobby. Corbin Bernson's Henry is still a fun, hard-nosed curmudgeon, but his workplace conflicts with Shawn are too rare. Step it up!""Psych Season 5"" is just more of the stuff we know and love -- mystery/comedy with a quirky pop-culture streak, and hint of romance here and there.",5,Oh brown snowman Gus...I think I'll miss you most of all.,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,2972,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fake', 'psychic', 'Shawn', 'Spencer', 'long-suffering', 'buddy', 'Burton', 'Guster', 'five', 'years', 'hilarious', 'mystery-comedy', 'signs', 'slowing', 'down', 'Psych', 'Season', '5', 'new', 'additions', 'plot', 'mainly', 'Shawn', 'love', 'life', 'most', 'time', 'usual', 'whirl', 'bizarre', 'crimes', 'quirky', 'solutions.Ever', 'Henry', 'was', 'put', 'charge', 'police', 'consultants', 'work', 'been', 'scarce', 'So', 'Shawn', 'James', 'Roday', 'way', 'case', 'Chinese', 'diplomat', 'missing', 'daughter', 'up', 'mired', 'Triads', 'martial-arts', 'very', 'unusual', 'romance', 'was', 'actually', 'NORMAL', 'case.As', 'season', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'must', 'deal', 'alien', 'abductions', 'professional', 'profiler', 'gang', 'prison', 'escapees', 'partner-swapping', 'gigolo', 'deaths', 'pair', 'retired', 'cops', 'spy', 'who', 'been', 'framed', 'dead', 'body', 'haunted', 'house', 'art', 'thief', 'determined', 'do', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'framed', 'polar', 'bear', 'stint', 'police', 'academy', 'Finally', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'do', 'battle', 'Mr.', 'Yin', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'life', 'college', 'student', 'see', 'true', 'face.Best', 'parts', 'season', 'boys', 'take', 'trip', 'Dual', 'Spires', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'name', 'Shawn', 'important', 'case', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'experience', 'where', 'grouchy', 'Tony', 'Cox', 'what', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'would', 'be', 'had', ""n't"", 'returned.It', 'entirely', 'possibly', 'Psych', 'Season', '5', 'not', 'best', 'season', 'so', 'far', 'then', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'Fortunately', 'creator', 'Steve', 'Franks', 'sticking', 'old', 'adage', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'season', ""n't"", 'deviate', 'what', 'still', 'lots', 'comedy', 'spoofery', 'silly', 'dialogue', 'would', 'mean', ""'re"", 'war', 'machines', 'enjoyable', 'mysteries.The', 'writers', 'deftly', 'juggle', 'funny-sounding', 'plot', 'twists', 'nunchuk-wielding', 'nerd', 'Cinnamon', 'festival', 'cram', 'endless', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Disaster', 'Movie', 'best', 'aspect', 'Psych', 'be', 'kooky', 'dialogue', 'What', 'are', 'guys', 'UFO', 'chasers', 'Nothing', 'as', 'ridiculous', ""'re"", 'psychic', 'detectives', '.But', 'season', 'startling', 'development', 'Shawn', 'love', 'life', 'four-and-a-half', 'seasons', 'dancing', 'Shawn', 'Juliet', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'finally', 'quit', 'messing', 'around', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'romance', 'backseat', 'mysteries', 'focus', 'still', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'strong', 'friendship', 'Hill', 'Roday', 'are', 'still', 'brilliant', 'depicting', 'weird', 'wacky', 'supporting', 'cast', 'still', 'brilliant', 'work', 'Maggie', 'Lawson', 'Juliet', 'aftermath', 'near-death', 'experience', 'Timothy', 'Ormundson', 'Lassiter', 'new', 'hobby', 'Corbin', 'Bernson', 'Henry', 'still', 'fun', 'hard-nosed', 'curmudgeon', 'workplace', 'conflicts', 'Shawn', 'are', 'too', 'rare', 'Step', 'up', 'Psych', 'Season', '5', 'just', 'more', 'stuff', 'know', 'love', 'mystery/comedy', 'quirky', 'pop-culture', 'streak', 'hint', 'romance', 'here', 'there']",Psych: The Complete Fifth Season

1353449,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B003L77H1E,G. Denick,"[1, 1]","I have now watched the first five seasons of Psych to completion, and this is a show that keeps getting better and better. It has quickly become one of my top three shows, if not my favorite. There is no better duo, in any medium, than Shawn and Gus (or ""Guy Buttersnaps"", as he is sometimes known). These guys have chemistry like nobody else, and their banter is absolutely hilarious. This is a show that just makes me LAUGH when I watch it... it's the definition of ""FEEL GOOD"". So well written is the show, and so finely executed, the Psych team has taken something that was boring, tired, and formulaic (the police procedural), and turned it into a marathon of comic genius. It's downright weird, because even when somebody is murdered on this show, it comes off as being humorous. It's like the polar opposite of ""The Shield"".Also notable is the fact that in addition to being 45 minute episodes of comedy, each story is also a functional, self-contained mystery, with all the clues necessary for a sharp viewer to solve the case alongside Shawn and Gus. The show's enjoyment level is further fulfilled by the supporting cast. They do a fine job of continuing their excellent work, most notably Shawn's surly dad, Detective Lassie, and the ever-lovable Julia.Highlights of this season included a return trip to Canada, in which Shawn and Gus confront the slippery-yet-noble criminal known as Despereaux, Lassie taking up tap dancing, and a polar bear who is accused of murder, while the psychic detectives fight to prove the toothed beast's innocence. You can't go wrong with Shawn and Gus... I'm now into Season Six, and loving every minute of my time spent in Santa Barbara!",5,"""What is this?

1353450,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003L77H1E,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Since we're baring our souls today, I admit it took me time to get into PSYCH. When it debuted, first impression suggested a flighty tone, and I reasoned: If Shawn Spenser was this half-ass about his claim to psychic prowess, I couldn't see how the Santa Barbara Police Department could take him seriously. So over the years I saw random episodes here and there, but it wasn't must-see television in my household. I didn't think it had staying power. Six years later, here's PSYCH still going strong, and here's egg on my face. When my girlfriend placed me in a devastating leg scissor lock I was forced to watch the entirety of Season 5. And now I'm hooked.PSYCH is currently the longest running show on the USA network, and it's been renewed for a seventh and eighth season. If you're a fellow neophyte, the premise goes like so: Feckless and immature, Shawn Spencer (James Roday) parlays his photographic memory and his keen observational skills into posing as a psychic detective. With his best friend Gus (Dul&eacute; Hill), he solves mysteries while acting as a consultant for the SBPD.Here's the sitch as Season 5 opens: A traumatized Detective Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) is still recovering from her harrowing experience in the episode, ""Mr. Yin Presents..."" (the Season 4 finale). Shawn's exacting ex-cop dad, Henry Spencer (corbin Bernsen), is now in charge of SBPD's consultants. But if Shawn thought that meant a heftier caseload for him and Gus, no, nuh-uh. Still, there's no dearth of murder in sunny Santa Barbara.Turns out, I grinned all day at the endless shenanigans Shawn and Gus get up to. Roday and Hill exhibit fantastic buddy chemistry and impeccable comic timing. Maybe the over-the-top antics go down smoother now - as opposed to when I saw earlier episodes years ago - because Shawn Spencer now has something that grounds him. And that's his relationship with Juliet. Even though his interactions with her are frequently marked with jokes and gags, it's obvious that, underneath all that, he cares for her deeply. And that lends depth and dimension to his character. Suddenly, to me, he's progressed beyond being only a caricature.Season 5 is packed with terrific episodes, plenty of which are send-ups. PSYCH spoofs THE FAST & THE FURIOUS (""Shawn & Gus in Drag (Racing)""), the Bourne films (""One, Maybe Two Ways Out""), and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (""The Polarizing Express""). PSYCH also pokes fun - but mostly pays homage - to TWIN PEAKS in ""Dual Spires,"" an episode which reunites most of the cast of TWIN PEAKS. One of the joys of the show is that it occasionally tweaks the theme song to reflect the episode's theme. In ""Dual Spires,"" Julee Cruise, who originally sang the theme song to TWIN PEAKS, submits a haunting interpretation of ""I Know You Know,"" the PSYCH theme song. Still, me being a hopeless (but manly and hirsute) romantic, the best thing about this season is that there's serious and very gratifying headway made in the Shawn/Juliet dynamics. Accordingly, ""Extradition II: The Actual Extradition Part"" is my favorite Season 5 episode, with ""One, Maybe Two, Ways Out"" a close second. So I get it now. Shawn Spencer just isn't inclined to resign to maturity. It's okay. I'm a convert. I've embraced the deception and learned how to bend. This show got me psyched in the end.My favorite season 5 episodes:- Episode 501 - ""Romeo and Juliet and Juliet"" - in which Shawn thinks he knows kung fu (he doesn't).- Episode 502 - ""Feet Don't Kill Me Now"" - Gus and Lassiter bond over tap-dancing.- Episode 503 - ""Not Even Close... Encounters"" - In this UFO abduction-centric episode, Freddie Prinze, Jr. guest-stars as the jock adult version of Shawn and Gus's chubby childhood nerd pal.- Episode 506 - ""Viagra Falls"" - Carl Weathers and William Devane are two geriatric ex-cops who keep one-upping Shawn and Gus during a murder case.- Episodes 509 & 510 - ""One, Maybe Two, Ways Out"" and ""Extradition II: The Actual Extradition Part"" - Two game-changing episodes, the latter of which features the return of suave art thief Pierre Despereaux (Cary Elwes).- Episode 512 - ""Dual Spires"" - The TWIN PEAKS homage.- Episode 513 - ""We'd Like to Thank the Academy"" - To instill in Shawn and Gus a better grasp of SBPD's operating procedures, Chief Vick enrolls them to the police academy under Ralph Macchio's tutelage.- Episode 516 - ""Yang 3 in 2D"" pits our guys one more time against the homicidal Yin (Peter Weller) and Yang (Ally Sheedy).This PSYCH Season 5 DVD set has 16 episodes on 4 discs, with the following bonus stuff:- Cast & Creator Audio Commentaries on 7 episodes: ""Romeo and Juliet and Juliet - Extended Version,"" ""Not Even Close... Encounters,"" ""Viagra Falls,"" ""Extradition 2: The Actual Extradition Part,"" ""Dual Spires - Extended Version,"" ""The Polarizing Express,"" and ""Yang 3 in 2d""- Writers' Video Commentaries on 14 episodes - with James Roday sitting in on three of these: ""Dual Spires"" (which he co-wrote), ""The Polarizing Express"" (which he directed and co-wrote), and ""Yand 3 in 2d"" (which he co-wrote)- Deleted Scenes for 13 episodes- Extended Version of ""Romeo and Juliet and Juliet""- Super-Extended version of ""Dual Spires""- Making of the ""Dual Spires"" episode (00:09:50 minutes) - featuring loads of interviews with the cast of TWIN PEAKS- ""No Comment"" - Behind the scenes of the PSYCH commentary of the ""Yang 3 in 2d"" episode (00:05:39 minutes)- Gag Reel (00:04:01

For those who said this season is the season Psych began losing its luster I respond with an emphatic quote of ""NOT""!For me this show has thus far (through to season six) only gotten better; each season outdoing its predecessor. I have said it before when reviewing Psych seasons and will say it again, if you don't like this show (or season) you must not enjoy laughter (or delicious flavor).From the start with Romeo and Juliet and Juliet the hits keep coming. ""It's woo shoo. Woo shoo sounds more authentic...It's sounds delicious""; Gus's rant at the martial arts store remains priceless. ""You wanna know crazy? I sued 300 businesses last year alone. I sued a hot dog cart and got everything but the wheels and the buns, which I won in the civil case two months later"".Then, to have Freddie Prinze Jr make a guest appearance (one I would not be mad to see him reprise) as the closet nerd friend of Shawn and Gus in what I believe may be the best acting role of his career, ""Not Even Close...Encounters"" is comedy gold!To see see Carl Weathers and William Devane as the two aging detectives (or future Shawn and Gus) was priceless. I STILL use the phrase ""you disappointing me son"" every once in a while as needed.And please, please do not overlook the non-stop comedy gold witnessed in Shawn 2.0. The pop culture references alone send this episode soaring not to mention we finally meet someone worthy of being a nemesis to Shawn in Declan. The cherry on top had to be the appearance of Kurt Smith of Tears For Fears (and Shawn's reaction to seeing him).I could go on and on (much respect to the Dual Spires episode-even though prior to the episode I never watched Twin Peaks).The only area I won't disagree with is the final episode of the season. It wasn't my favorite and I did find it lacking where the other two Yang tie ins were successful. Once Mary Lightly is removed from the equation, it just doesn't work quite as well.All in all this was a FANtastic season and season six (spoiler alert).... was even better!
