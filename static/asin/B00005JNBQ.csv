From the opening scene, things looked mildly promising. Napolean, the nerdiest, sleepiest-looking high-schooler you've ever seen hops on a school bus where another kid asks, ""Napolean, what are you going to do today?"" Napolean replies ""Whatever I feel like -- GOSH!"" with a little jerk of his head. Then he pulls a plastic figurine from his pocket, ties a string around its neck, and lowers it out of the window, letting it drag along the ground behind the bus. All right, I thought, this is going to be one of those screwy comedies full of eccentric characters who do random things. I was prepared for that, but I wasn't prepared for the 90-minute borefest that ensued. With no real plot to speak of, and characters that just aren't that likeable or interesting, I found myself longing for the movie to be over only a few minutes into it. I stuck it through in the hopes that it would improve, but no such luck. As far as comedes go, the humor in this one is quite subtle, and consistent in style throughout. If you like the first ten minutes, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the movie. If after ten minutes you find it isn't your cup of tea, stop there--it doesn't get any better.I was tempted to give only one star, but I felt like being a little generous, perhaps because after suffering through this movie, I finally can understand references to it (those ""Vote for Pedro"" bumper stickers and tee-shirts, my family's quotes, and Heder's recent appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was quite funny after seeing this film). Apparently, this is a film you either love or hate. I can't stand it.

And of course there's Napolean's best friend Pedro whose expectations are unrealistic sometimes.This movie does not conform to any Hollywood template, and some people will see the humor in it while other won't, in the same way some think Woody Allen is hilarious and others can't stand him.

628127,A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G,B00005JNBQ,"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF""","[8, 10]","Napoleon Dynamite is a loser who goes to high school and is treated fairly well considering how much of a loser he is.  He wears t-shirts tucked into perfectly-fit jeans, the bottoms of which are tucked into snowboots, which is interesting considering not a flake of snow falls in the entire film, although he is from Idaho, where perhaps snow is something that if it's not falling outside, it's falling in your mind.  His one friend is Pedro, the only Latin-American student in a school filled with blonde-haired, blue-eyed wunderkinds.Actually the people who makeup the school, and the surrounding town, are quite fascinating.  They're not gorgeous, or classically beautiful, but grotesque.  That is; they could be beautiful, or at least considered attractive, but there's an element of ugliness to them, some sort of black smudge on the colorful canvas.  Napoleon is emblematic of this in that he is grotesque himself; his hair is curly and uncontrollable, his clothes are almost purposefully unattractive, his slouch and his half-closed eyes make him look as unalert as a rock.  So is everyone around him; unalert to the qualities that make them grotesque (although that is essentially what being grotesque is; you have to not know you are).Enough about grotesqueries!  Pedro decides to run for class president to bring balance to the darkness that is the other candidate, the plucky Summer.  She is the ""most popular girl"" in school, and is surely a lock to win.  The futility of Pedro's chances of winning lend a pity to his character that we might feel for Napoleon if he wasn't so blatantly unconcerned with his own popularity.  Pedro has no idea what to say in his pre-election speech; but Napoleon says, either out of exasperation or genuine concern, ""Tell them if they vote for you then all their wildest dreams will come true.""  Hmm.  Sounds like a throwaway line at first, but Pedro delivers it at the end of a speech that is sure to lose him the election.  It makes you wonder why he really cares about winning the election, especially since he seemed to understand how futile it all was.  To make things even more hopeless, after his speech, he must deliver a skit.  A skit?  Pedro has no clue, and he's even less animated than Napoleon.Then comes one of the most touching scenes I have ever seen.  Napoleon gives a dance-mix tape to the guy running the PA, goes on stage, and dances to ""Canned Heat.""  Then you realize that underneath that facade of unawareness and passivity is a genuine friend.  He basically lays his life on the line if you think about it; for how would the entire school treat him afterwards if they took it the wrong way?  He could barely set foot in that High School if it failed, his life would be made miserable day after day.  But it works!  They roar with applause; and Pedro becomes class president.Amazingly all ends meet, in a movie without a punchline.  What happens to Napoleon now though?

628128,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JNBQ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 16]","This film has been at our local independent theater for about six months now.  I could be exaggerating, but I do not know the exact time.  All I do know is that it has been there for a very long extended period of time.  I have heard from several kids (children between the ages of 10 and 15) that this was a very funny movie and it seemed like the parents were in agreement.  Normally, this would turn me off a film, but since it was a ""independent"" film, I thought that perhaps we had stumbled onto a goldmine and I was the last to reap the benefits.  So, without delay, I gathered up some friends and sat (with cackling girls behind us) as nearly two hours of my life was drained from my soul.  Between the inconsistent story, the jumbled themes, the off-beat pacing, the teenage girls laughing before the joke happened, and the ""must-seem-independent"" feel Napoleon Dynamite just didn't work.I know, I know, let the gasping of air commence.  I have trouble seeing what everyone has loved about this film.  To begin with, why were we laughing at this character?  I remember the audience similarly laughing hysterically at Sandler's character in Punch-Drunk Love.  Is this character made to be laughed at?  Didn't anyone in the audience feel sorry for this underprivileged teenager?  While others were laughing hysterically at the overused and uncreative words that vomited from Napoleon's mouth, I was feeling sad for this guy.  He was constantly getting pushed around in school, he had a disorder of some kind that nobody seemed concerned about, and at first he had no friends.  He was a product of a dysfunctional family that we found funny.  It wasn't funny.  This film wasn't funny.  This film was sad, with some elements of humor mixed in to cover up the inhumanity.Perhaps I am being too harsh on this film.  Perhaps I should just take it as a light comedy that speaks to the insecure teenager in all of us.  Sadly, I cannot.  Even if you look past the characters, which all seemed forced by the actors playing them, the cinematography and story was not very strong.  Napoleon did things that made no sense to me.  At first I thought he was a very intelligent person, just misunderstood in school, but later I discovered that he was just an idiot.  Education came last behind tetherball, girls, tots, and Pedro.  I never once understood the time frame of this film.  Were we watching a film set today, but seemingly still lost in the 80s or were we watching an 80s film?  Was the director paying homage to the 80s, or simply making fun of them?  These were key issues that needed to be explained that never were developed.  The music and costume pointed to the 80s, yet the music and calendars pointed to 2004.  There needed to be a set time for this film and it needed to be released so that we, the audience, were not confused by this idea.  Even the dancing seemed dated.Next, while we were outside watching Napoleon create more insecurity for those unlike others, his family also co-existed with him.  This meant that while we were watching Napoleon at school, his family was continuing with life whether we knew what was going on or not.  This was a major downfall to this film.  I wanted to see more of a story with Kip and LaFawnduh.  I wanted to know more about Uncle Rico and the life that he led. I can honestly say that Uncle Rico's character was the least developed character that I have encountered in film in a long time.  I wanted to know more about Deb.  There was so much exploring that could have happened with this film that I felt cheated when the film was finally over.  Napoleon's world was huge, and maybe if we did more than just scratch the surface of his life I would have enjoyed this film much more.Overall, this was a very poor film.  I could not relate or get involved with the characters in any way.  I felt the director was trying too hard to make the film seem independent with amateur shots and oddball antics.  Near the middle of this film I began seeing images that other directors have used especially like Wes Anderson (see Bottle Rocket) and Sophia Coppola (see Virgin Suicides).  But instead of actual creativity and some smart and witty writing, this film just fell short by substituting lines like ""sweet"" and ""GOSH"".  This was a sad excuse for character development.  I felt like I was watching a high school project that felt (and was) plagiarized and uncreative.  This was not the film that everyone spoke of, this was a petty excuse for a film by cheating us into thinking it could be more by having low budgets and a seriously challenged main character.  This is not a comedy.  While I did grin a brief moment during the FFA testing, the rest of the time I was counting the minutes until it was over.

When I finally saw the film, I wasn't disappointed.  The plot, in a nutshell, is...well, there really *isn't* much of a plot.  The film follows a few days in the life of Napoleon Dynamite, uber-geek.  He lives with his grandmother and brother, Kip.  When Grandma gets hurt, Uncle Rico moves in to take care of them (even though Kip is 30!).  Meanwhile, Napoleon befriends the new kid at school, Pedro, who is also a misfit.I've only seen the film once so far, but I'm sure it will be even funnier the second time because the first viewing is spent ""taking it all in"".  It's very odd, and very funny, and I lost count of all the great quotable lines in the film.  Another thing worth mentioning is that they could show this film on network television without editing anything -- there is no foul language or content that would be inappropriate for young viewers.  I'm not one of those ""holier than thou"" types (who, quite honestly, I loathe, because they tend to be hypocrites), but as someone with a family, I can appreciate a film we can all watch together.So check it out -- and stick around after the credits to see Kip singing to Lafawnduh!",4,"Original, funny, and more than a little strange",1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,1250,"['co-worker', 'mine', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'never', 'stopped', 'talking', 'When', 'finally', 'saw', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'plot', 'nutshell', 'well', 'really', ""*isn't*"", 'much', 'plot', 'film', 'few', 'days', 'life', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'uber-geek', 'grandmother', 'brother', 'Kip', 'When', 'Grandma', 'hurt', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'take', 'care', 'even', 'Kip', '30', 'Meanwhile', 'Napoleon', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'Pedro', 'who', 'also', 'misfit.I', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'film', 'once', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'funnier', 'second', 'time', 'first', 'viewing', 'spent', 'taking', 'very', 'odd', 'very', 'funny', 'lost', 'count', 'great', 'quotable', 'lines', 'film', 'thing', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'could', 'show', 'film', 'network', 'television', 'editing', 'anything', 'foul', 'language', 'content', 'would', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'young', 'viewers', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'holier', 'thou', 'types', 'who', 'quite', 'honestly', 'loathe', 'tend', 'be', 'hypocrites', 'someone', 'family', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'together.So', 'check', 'out', 'stick', 'around', 'credits', 'see', 'Kip', 'singing', 'Lafawnduh']",Napoleon Dynamite

It deterred me even more when I saw the ""MTV Films"" logo jump into the screen at the beginning. But to my surprise, Napoleon Dynamite turned out to be a smart, and uniquely funny independent film.You can't help but feel pity for most of the characters in this film. Uncle Rico's delusional dreams of being an all-star quarterback circa 1982. Pedro, the quiet pinata smashing Mexican, or poor Deb, who's just trying to raise money for college. Kip (Napoleon's Brother) is one of the stranger characters in the film, who seems to be gay, but is in love with LaFawnduh, a voluptuous black woman he met over the internet. For whatever reason, these characters are very appealing to the average movie watcher.Although the movie has little to no plot, it doesn't pale in originality. So many of the jokes are different, dry and satirical, that some of them slip through the cracks. This film is great for repeat watching, just because it is so unique, and so many of the jokes are like ""What!?""; it just makes you want to see them again. I would say that young geeks like myself would like this movie the most, but it seems that geeks of all ages relate to the movie equally. I would go as far as to say that non-geeks would look down on, or feel pity for the characters enough to chuckle at.

It is funny, and despite the moments (long, long moments) when nothing seems to happen, the timing is impeccable.  If you don't *really* have a funny bone in your body, don't watch this.  (If all you get is put-down humor, stay away.  Seriously.)Plot Summary.  Napoleon Dynamite is an awkward young man; a skateboard dude who hasn't actually discovered a skateboard.  He is continually bullied by the cool kids in his school, but manages to keep up a level of defiance (a little whiny, though), and somehow you sense that this fellow is not one who needs the endorsement of his peers.  Still, he continues to reach out to an amazing degree; a dude who does not accept that he has been branded a loser.In his awkward fashion, he befriends a Latino kid, and a slightly eccentric girl.  Despite the cartoon-like style of these two characters, they manage to be quite 3-dimensional in their own way.  Other important people are Napoleon's brother (Kyle?); his uncle, an aging football player wannabe; Tina, a Llama (totally cute), and (last but not least) LaFawndah, a girl Kyle meets on the internet.  There's also Summer what'sername's mother, an indealistic midwestern woman who encourages her daughter to accept Napoleon's invitation to a school dance.As you will see, none of the 'stereotypes' in the movie are what one expects them to be, exactly.  And when Deb (the girl who turns up on Napoleon's doorstep, selling discount photo portraits) realizes, to her alarm, that a customer is hitting on her, she responds with the kind of grave reproach that is an example to us all!

A lot of really strange vignettes happen in the first half hour that really don't make a lot of sense (our man throwing a toy with a string on it out of a school bus window and watching it drag along the road, a farmer shooting a cow (offscreen, thank goodness) for no apparant reason, Napoleon and Pedro's female friend shyly attempting to sell Napoleon some junk, etc). Plus, the actors playing Napoleon and his best friend Pedro Sanchez look WAY too old to be in high school.But after you sit through this with some patience, the ""story"" begins to hang together. Bascially, it's a really SWEET (as Napoleon would say) story of the bonds of friendship being established among social outcasts. Also, it's chock full of wild catch phrases (such as the title of this review) with deadpan delivery that you can't help but shout out at repeated viewings.Of course, there are bound to be ultrasensitive over PC need-to-get-a-life types who will criticize this movie for some ethnic stereotyping. Here I refer to Pedro Sanchez himself and his admittedly hackneyed Mexican-American accent, Pedro's lowriding (apparently) gangbanging cousins, and LaFawnda, the Detroit ghetto queen who Napoleon's brother falls in love with over the internet. As an African-American myself, I would have to say that this is not ""Soul Plane"" or the ""Frito Bandito."" These characters are likeable people who, beneath the superficial cultural differences, anybody could relate to. Plus, LaFawnda (unlike the overtly ghetto fabulous/slum pitiful sisters of UPN and BET) has a touch of class about herself and a good heart (in her advice to Napoleon in particular). As for Pedro, he's a fish out of water that is also a very sympathetic character.But overall, anyone who has ever felt like they've been on the outside of humanity looking in (and who hasn't felt that way from time to time?) could realte to at least something this film, so see it.

Rather it is a dead pan comedy that runs very much counter to what one might expect of an American film.Napoleon is a sixteen year old nerd attending high school in the back blocks of Idaho - beautiful scenery but relentlessly boring in terms of lifestyle.  He is picked on at school and clearly doesn't fit in.  His only friend is an alienated Mexican also trying to come to grips with mid west America.  However, together they ultimately succeed despite Napoleon also having to deal with his dysfunctional family.  He has a crazy thrill seeking grandmother, a loser geek brother and an uncle whose mind still dwells in 1982.  Yet, somehow, this bizarre mix is conquered.Despite protestations from my son, I'm unable to give this film more than three stars.  Perhaps it's me that doesn't fit in?

628161,A1I9DQA9HCQKBR,B00005JNBQ,Ashley Allinson,"[2, 2]","Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is, without question, the sleeper comedy of the year.  Influenced by Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and Paul Feig's ""Freaks and Geeks"", Napoleon Dynamite is a study in isolation that clearly distances itself from the two.  Napoleon, played by newcomer Jon Herder, is a quirky geek from rural Idaho who, like many before him within the genre, has problems relating to others.  His obvious disregard for the way in which others view him, including the audience, isolates him further.  The fact is that Napoleon Dynamite is a character study that never actually studies a character.It nestles itself within the genre of alienated teen comedy by taking 85 minutes to deliver and repeat a one liner.  Situations present themselves whereby Napoleon is put on the spot.  His obvious disregard for how others receive his words deliver the joke, as there are no consequences for his action.  Things here stay stagnant, a journey that takes us nowhere except to the realization that we are laughing out loud, situation after situation.What distinguishes this film from others within the genre is that there is no revenge from this nerd; there isn't even any change in his disposition.  Rather, Jared Hess takes us through a week in the life of a geek leading up to the prom.  The anxiety pertaining to this, as seen in so many other films, is totally underdeveloped, which works.To suggest that Napoleon is comfortable with the way he handles himself is an understatement, but i guess that is fitting since this film is a total understatement.

It floats along, aimless most of the time, yet in some odd way it kept my attention for the 90 minutes it ran. I do like Napoleon Dynamite. He's such a dork-- he's flippin' clueless and, what other reasons do you need, God! That's the way he talks. It's actually pretty funny!Without John Heder, I don't think this movie could have survived or gained the momentum that it did. He IS Napoleon. Anyone else would have just been way under par. So Napoleon lives with his grandmother, his nerdy skinny brother, and a pet llama named Tina. He meets Pedro, a new kid a school and Deb, a shy girl who ""left all her crap on [his] porch,"" an assortment of bracelets and what not. They float along together, as Napoleon battles his Uncle Rico, tries to get dates, and also attmpets to elect Pedro as president of the school.Hard to say whether or not you'll like this. My punk rocking sister loved it. My dad enjoys movies overall and called it ""quirky."" Which usually means he liked it. My mom hated it, but she's apt to dislike any comedy unless it has Jim Carrey in it. I liked this one. It's weird, but Napoleon was too interesting for me to turn it off.

No.  Monty Python is deadpan humor.  Leslie Nielson is deapan humor.  This movie is devoid of anything even remotely resembling humor of any kind.

For a long time, I keep hearing people talking about the movie, certain scenes, and laughing until their on the floor about things I didn't know about. Why it took me so long to get on the Napoleon train, I have no idea. But it's now officially over. I have been Napoleoned, and there is no going back. Now I join everyone else, proud of my wisdom in all things Napoleon. It's good to be a member of the club. The film itself?. All I have got to say is that the writer and director of the movie must of been nerds in high school, or at least knew someone who was. Their depiction of Napoleon, and High School in general, is so specific and spot on, that it must of come from both of their lives. That's how good this movie is. Jon Heder plays Napoleon, the biggest geek you ever saw, who lives with his grandmother and older brother Kip(who I swear plays Weigel's serial killer boyfriend on ""Reno 911""). They live in some no name, bodunk Idaho town, that's just as forgettable as the people who live in it. The look of the movie is worth noting as well. The people in the movie are plain, and their environments accompany them. The movie is shot well to go with the people. Whoever scouted this location for the film has a nice eye. But what is the movie really about?. Not sure. There's not so much of a plot going here, just an observance of life. A peek into the life of this nerdy high schooler and the people who populate his existence. But Napoleon does have some missions. Get his new friend, Pedro, elected as class president, and to get a date to the prom. The boys' uncle(played by Jon Gries, wig and all)comes to look over them too. Tina Majorino also appears as the girl who likes Napoleon, and he likewise. She was so real and believeable in her role. The acting and characterizations are done to a T. The movie and people are so real, that you expect to drive to this Idaho town and really find them. That's good praise to the writing and acting of this film. Heder is a marvel. Where did he come from?. He's amazing. He brings this character to life in a way I have never seen a character, nerd or otherwise, achieve. The movie may not be for everyone's taste, but it is worth checking out and sticking it out to the end for. There are so many good scenes, and this has to be the most quoteable movie to come along in a very long time. The film's humor is sometimes odd, sometimes subtle, but always very funny. I am catching new things I didn't notice the first time I saw it. No doubt about it, Napoleon Dynamite is like no other. It's charm, characters, and way of life, is all it's own.

But the way it revolves around Napoleon's strange and twisted life, from his stay-at-home, Internet-obsessed older brother to his out-and-about grandmother and his living-in-the-past uncle (1982? Need I say more?), I found myself not looking for a plot. Simply observing the way they lived and engaged with other people was so hysterical I didn't even think of a plot (save for Pedro's race against Summer).Napoleon Dynamite is confusing. It has a kind of dry humor that I haven't really seen in many other kinds of films. Personally, Napoleon wasn't the easiest character to love; he often barked at family members and randomly expected people to do orders for him (which is later explained in the DVD commentary), but in the end I found myself rooting for Napoleon as he won over his school during Pedro's skit.Before I end, I'd like to personally address reviewer Donna who totally criticised the movie over the Mexican ""racism."" I am Mexican and found absolutely nothing offensive. It appears to me that you don't watch absolutely any TV since that is how most Mexicans are portrayed and while I don't act like that at all, I do know many who do just like in the movie(s). This movie isn't trying to make a point. It's just trying to be funny; it's not trying to piss anybody off.I highly recommened this film. While some may not immediately understand the film's rather dry sense of humor, those who do take part in it will eventually see it and find themselves laughing all the way.",5,"""Revenge of the Nerds"" for the new generation",1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,1916,"['Easily', 'latest', 'cult', 'classic.I', 'must', 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'had', 'idea', 'even', 'existed', 'Uponwatching', 'trailer', 'television', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'was', 'literally', 'stitches', 'floor', 'Just', 'look', 'Napoleon', 'face', 'better', 'watch', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'something', 'was', 'enough', 'send', 'hysterical', 'laughter.It', 'plotless', 'completly', 'am', 'totally', 'admitting', 'way', 'Napoleon', 'strange', 'twisted', 'life', 'stay-at-home', 'Internet-obsessed', 'older', 'brother', 'out-and-about', 'grandmother', 'living-in-the-past', 'uncle', '1982', 'Need', 'say', 'more', 'found', 'not', 'looking', 'plot', 'Simply', 'observing', 'way', 'lived', 'engaged', 'other', 'people', 'was', 'so', 'hysterical', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'plot', 'save', 'Pedro', 'race', 'Summer', '.Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'confusing', 'kind', 'dry', 'humor', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'kinds', 'films', 'Personally', 'Napoleon', 'was', ""n't"", 'easiest', 'character', 'love', 'often', 'barked', 'family', 'members', 'randomly', 'expected', 'people', 'do', 'orders', 'later', 'explained', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'end', 'found', 'rooting', 'Napoleon', 'won', 'over', 'school', 'Pedro', 'skit.Before', 'end', ""'d"", 'like', 'personally', 'address', 'reviewer', 'Donna', 'who', 'totally', 'criticised', 'movie', 'Mexican', 'racism', 'am', 'Mexican', 'found', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'absolutely', 'TV', 'how', 'most', 'Mexicans', 'are', 'portrayed', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'do', 'know', 'many', 'who', 'do', 'just', 'like', 'movie', 's', 'movie', ""n't"", 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'just', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'trying', 'piss', 'anybody', 'off.I', 'highly', 'recommened', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'immediately', 'understand', 'film', 'rather', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'who', 'do', 'take', 'part', 'will', 'eventually', 'see', 'find', 'laughing', 'way']",Napoleon Dynamite

Commendable aspects of this movie were that it was outstandingly hilarious, in fact I think there are never any periods of three minutes or more in the movie that go without an amusing comment from Napoleon. One such amusing comment is when Napoleon is asked by a kid on his bus what he is going to do today and he replies ""Whatever I feel like doing!

I watched it twice before I laughed at certain parts (usually those involving Uncle Rico, Deb or Kip, not Napoleon). In my opinion, it's not the laugh out loud type of film that some promote it to be. It's more of a human observation film.The casting was perfect. The acting was skillful, especially when you watch the physical ineptitude of Kip and Napoleon.I don't think we were supposed to love Napoleon's dismissive, damaged demeanor. Ultra shy Deb barely talks, and then talks with her mouth full. Uncle Rico is lost to a fading dream. Kip can be sadistic (review the 'time machine' sequence - he knew what was going to happen). These aren't cutesy characters you are going to warm to right away.But the go back and look at Napoleon when he gets stood up at the dance. There's no blatant show of disappointment, but you can tell the guy is hurt.Nobody tells Napoleon or Pedro that a skit is expected after Pedro's speech. Almost everyone wants Pedro to lose. Like a true friend, Napoleon steps in and helps Pedro out - he 'has his back'.When Napoleon watches Kip carrying Lafawnduh's luggage onto the bus, he even manages his only smile in the movie.They weren't using sledgehammers to get the point across.In the end, I think the point is that there is hope for everyone, even the hopeless.",5,Naysayers don't know what they're looking at,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,1602,"['have', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'little', 'patience', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'in-yer-face', 'profanity', 'skin', 'violence', 'basically', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', ""'subtlety"", 'means', 'then', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'agree', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', 'low', 'marks.This', 'movie', 'subtleties', 'folks', 'watched', 'twice', 'laughed', 'certain', 'parts', 'usually', 'involving', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'Deb', 'Kip', 'not', 'Napoleon', 'opinion', 'not', 'laugh', 'loud', 'type', 'film', 'promote', 'be', 'more', 'human', 'observation', 'film.The', 'casting', 'was', 'perfect', 'acting', 'was', 'skillful', 'especially', 'when', 'watch', 'physical', 'ineptitude', 'Kip', 'Napoleon.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'supposed', 'love', 'Napoleon', 'dismissive', 'damaged', 'demeanor', 'Ultra', 'shy', 'Deb', 'barely', 'talks', 'then', 'talks', 'mouth', 'full', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'lost', 'fading', 'dream', 'Kip', 'can', 'be', 'sadistic', 'review', ""'time"", 'machine', 'sequence', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'are', ""n't"", 'cutesy', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'warm', 'right', 'away.But', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'Napoleon', 'when', 'stood', 'up', 'dance', 'blatant', 'show', 'disappointment', 'can', 'tell', 'guy', 'hurt.Nobody', 'tells', 'Napoleon', 'Pedro', 'skit', 'expected', 'Pedro', 'speech', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'Pedro', 'lose', 'true', 'friend', 'Napoleon', 'steps', 'helps', 'Pedro', ""back'.When"", 'Napoleon', 'Kip', 'carrying', 'Lafawnduh', 'luggage', 'bus', 'even', 'only', 'smile', 'movie.They', 'were', ""n't"", 'using', 'sledgehammers', 'get', 'point', 'end', 'think', 'point', 'hope', 'everyone', 'even', 'hopeless']",Napoleon Dynamite

He gets ignored or crapped on at school every day. His family make his life unbearable every day, and nobody will play ball on a rope with him, ever! Even so he remains convinced that by perfecting his skills he will come out on top. The skills include drawing animals and potential prom dates portraits. He would like to have nunchuck skills and be able to catch some sweet air on his friends bike, but he can't. He has zero social skills. He hangs up the phone on people before they know the conversation is over. He keeps oven crunchies in his pocket to eat later. He really is beyond help in every way imaginable. But does he care. Nope. His grandma likes to race buggies out in the desert. His uncle is a door to door salesman who's obsessed with his failed high school football career. His brother revolves his life around internet chat rooms and gradually becomes the geekiest gangster pimp ever. His best and only friend has the only mostache in school and on this basis, runs for the school election.It's impossible to describe the feel and nature of this film because there is really nothing to compare it to.

628200,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00005JNBQ,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[5, 6]","One of the more absurd movies of the decade, Napoleon Dynamite nonetheless manages to be a hilarious comedy in its own right. Featuring a unique brand of alienated-teenage humor, the film relies more on its well-timed pauses and character body language than on zinging one-liners. If you enjoy its subtle humor, then Napoleon Dynamite is a film you'll find utterly hilarious. Otherwise, it might cause boredom or outright confusion. The film has a near non-existent storyline, but what it lacks in plot, it makes up for with its witty and hilarious comedy sequences...Jon Heder plays the title role of Napoleon Dynamite, an estranged and nerdy high school youth living with his grandmother and older brother, Kip (Aaron Ruell), in Preston, Idaho. Sporting a clueless, unchanging facial expression throughout the movie, Napoleon simply glides through life, getting kicked around, pushed into lockers, and watching life pass by. When a Spanish student named Pedro (Efren Ramirez) moves into town, Napoleon befriends the social outcast. The two drone on and on about myriad subjects, such as who to take to the upcoming dance. Fellow socially-challenged student Deb (Tina Majorino) becomes the object of their affections.Meanwhile, Kip trolls the Internet chat rooms in search of women, and Napoleon's Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) moves in with the boys while their grandmother is away. Uncle Rico's own exploits add to the hilarity of a film with little in the way of substance, at least until Pedro decides to run for class president against the school's most popular girl, Summer (Haylie Duff). Now, Napoleon and Pedro must work against all odds to win the school election...The true strength of Napoleon Dynamite is its clan of outrageous characters, characters that are so outrageously ridiculous that every viewer can point out the mirror image of that character from his own high school yearbook or current life experience. The arrested social development of Napoleon and his friends are amplified for effect within the film's context, drawing the viewer into a Lord of the Flies world of Darwinian adolescence. The humor is sometimes subtle, and Napoleon Dynamite is not to be confused with an Academy Award winning drama. But if you like stupid movies such Dumb And Dumber, then this is the film for you.Napoleon Dynamite is a unique comedy which pushes the boundaries of plot-challenged, immature filmmaking. In short, you'll love it. Most of the characters are so pathetic, you'll find yourself laughing at them simply because they exist. One of the biggest surprises of 2004, Napoleon Dynamite is an oddball comedy that definitely ranks as a must-see movie...The DVD Report",4,"Strange, unorthodox, but highly entertaining...",1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2676,"['One', 'more', 'absurd', 'movies', 'decade', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'nonetheless', 'be', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'own', 'right', 'Featuring', 'unique', 'brand', 'alienated-teenage', 'humor', 'film', 'more', 'well-timed', 'pauses', 'character', 'body', 'language', 'zinging', 'one-liners', 'enjoy', 'subtle', 'humor', 'then', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'film', ""'ll"", 'find', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'Otherwise', 'might', 'cause', 'boredom', 'outright', 'confusion', 'film', 'near', 'non-existent', 'storyline', 'what', 'plot', 'up', 'witty', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'sequences', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'title', 'role', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'estranged', 'nerdy', 'high', 'school', 'youth', 'living', 'grandmother', 'older', 'brother', 'Kip', 'Aaron', 'Ruell', 'Preston', 'Idaho', 'Sporting', 'clueless', 'unchanging', 'facial', 'expression', 'movie', 'Napoleon', 'simply', 'life', 'getting', 'kicked', 'pushed', 'lockers', 'watching', 'life', 'pass', 'When', 'Spanish', 'student', 'named', 'Pedro', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'town', 'Napoleon', 'social', 'outcast', 'two', 'drone', 'myriad', 'subjects', 'such', 'who', 'take', 'upcoming', 'dance', 'socially-challenged', 'student', 'Deb', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'object', 'affections.Meanwhile', 'Kip', 'Internet', 'chat', 'rooms', 'search', 'women', 'Napoleon', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'boys', 'grandmother', 'away', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'own', 'exploits', 'add', 'hilarity', 'film', 'little', 'way', 'substance', 'least', 'Pedro', 'run', 'class', 'president', 'school', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'Summer', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'Now', 'Napoleon', 'Pedro', 'must', 'work', 'odds', 'win', 'school', 'election', 'true', 'strength', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'clan', 'outrageous', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'outrageously', 'ridiculous', 'viewer', 'can', 'point', 'out', 'mirror', 'image', 'character', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'yearbook', 'current', 'life', 'experience', 'arrested', 'social', 'development', 'Napoleon', 'friends', 'are', 'amplified', 'effect', 'film', 'context', 'drawing', 'viewer', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'world', 'Darwinian', 'adolescence', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'subtle', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'drama', 'like', 'stupid', 'movies', 'such', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'then', 'film', 'you.Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'unique', 'comedy', 'boundaries', 'plot-challenged', 'immature', 'filmmaking', 'short', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'pathetic', ""'ll"", 'find', 'laughing', 'simply', 'exist', 'One', 'biggest', 'surprises', '2004', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'oddball', 'comedy', 'definitely', 'must-see', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Report']",Napoleon Dynamite
628201,A2PSB6TTB33M5L,B00005JNBQ,"Bruce Campbell ""destroyer_of_false_metal""","[3, 11]","Before you just skip over the review becuase i'm not ranting about how good it is, just take the time to read it. I read reviews in magaznes like Entertainment Weekly which said this movie wasn't really that good. They said it was dry and boring. So, i pretty much just ignored it. Then, a bunch of my firends saw it and were telling me how funny it was. At first i just argued with them, saying that it really wasn't that good, but i really had no basis to do so. I eventually gave in and when it came out on DVD, i rented it. It was only about 90 minutes, it would be that bad....Well i put it in my DVD player and sat there and i watched the whole thing. I laughed, i didn't fall on the floor laughing, but i did luagh, becuase it was funny. But about 45 minutes into it and it started to lose me. It just got boring. There was never really any plot established. There was that thing about the election, but nothing was ever developed. The ending came around, and Pedro wins the election, but i didn't seem to care. It was like the writer just tried to squeeze all this stuff into the last 45 minutes and it just became painful to watch, but i did finish it.There is one reason people love this and one reason only, and i'm not saying i don't fall into this category. Napoleon is a nerd, and as you probably now, nerds are not the most popular people in shcool. htey get picked on by the ""jocks"" and when those ""jocks"" watch this movie, they laugh at the Napoleon because they feel superior to him, they think they're better. As a matter of fact, anybody who isn't a nerd (or who tries to deny the fact and never accept it) feels the same way. It's the same reason that these people pick on nerds and laugh at them. I'll admit that i am one of these people and do in fact pick on the nerds, so i'm not going to lie to you. Now, the nerds see Napoleon and can realte to him and laugh at him that way, becuase they feel like they share his experinces.As i said, i did laugh, and i have repaeted SOME of the lines, becuase they were kind of funny. But, it just wasn't a good movie. If you could just look past the Napoleon and Kip and whoever else for just a second and look at the actual movie, you'll realize there is nothing there. The movie is just an excuse to put a bunch of nerds on screen make people laugh at them, not to make a movie. So, if you can accept that this really isn't a movie, you'll enjoy yourself, and i don't mean that as an insult. But, if you're like me, and you watch a movie in hopes that there is something there and that the movie is treated like the art form it really is, you won't make it through the whole movie, you might fall asleep.If you're looking for some good comedies in 2004, check out ""Shaun of the Dead"" or, despite negative critic reviews, ""I Heart Huckabees"". Also, if you're looking for a mindless comedy that is still extremly funny, and does have some kind of story going on, check out, ""Team America:World Police"".

Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[1, 2]","NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is an extremely original story idea that accidentally ended up being a work of comedic genius! Who would have ever thought of making a movie hero out of the biggest loser in your high school? That's what this film does, and it succeeds with great enthusiasm and sweet moves. Awesome!For a comedy, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE has MANY hilarious moments!Anybody who has gone through High School in the USA will quickly be able to identify and recognize the character types portrayed in this film.This film takes place in a small mid-western town that time forgot somewhere in the last 25 years. The citizens all have values and references about things from the 1980s, with things from the year 2005 appearing once in awhile.It is hard to tell whether or not the filmmakers are making fun of retarded people? Napoleon, his best friend Pedro, and their mutual friend Deb form a strange triangle of friendship and dating for dummies. But these dummies are loveable and endearing. By the end of the movie, the audience is cheering them on to succeed and beat the insurmountable societal odds against them.Napoleon is the movie's hero, and he saves the day, so if they are mocking retarded people, they at least give them much more dignity, respect and character development in this film than retarded people usually get in a real life High School.Everybody is pretty much a half-wit in this movie. What is funny is that they will explain their latest plan of action, (something so dumb and simple-minded that any ""normal"" person would immediately see that the plan is doomed to fail), but then somehow the plan will end up working itself out, after all, in a funny way.All the main characters are hopeless, helpless losers, but they somehow manage to work out something doable by sticking together and staying loyal--they got each other's backs.There is something innocent, naive and desperate in Napoleon's daily plight that we can all relate to, so we all end up rooting for Napoleon. He wants all these great things out of life, but feels practically helpless to be able to attain anything--which is where we all have been at some point in our own lives.NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is as funny as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, but Napoleon has more repeat viewing appeal, and much more incredible, memorable, quotable dialogue.This film reminds me of a more wholesome version of the real life documentary CRUMB, about the underground comic book artist R. Crumb. The CRUMB documentary shows what it's like for nerds of this caliber in real life, but CRUMB shows the dark side of life, where the Crumb family ended up--drugs, pornography, obscenity, mental illness. NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is the family friendly version of a nerd's life story.The first few times you watch NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, you will be laughing out loud with your friends, but after the shock and surprise has faded out of the gags, you will still end up watching the film, because it seems like you're hanging out with the gang--Napoleon's gang.

The major differences are that the main character in WTTD knows she's a dork, knows the other kids ridicule her for it, yet feels powerless to stop it and just unempowered in general.Not so with ND.  Although Napoleon is a dork among dorks, he's oblivious to it all. His apathy with life in general serves as a protective shield, and if he feels victimizes, he doesn't let it get him down and doesn't show it.  In a strange way, he has a lot of self confidence, because in his eyes, he's okay, and that's what matters.The story moves against a backdrop of gorgeous Idaho landscapes.  Who knew there was more to Idaho than just potatoes?Here's the story: Napoleon is an apathetic nerd whose life is inhabited by a daredevil, dune-bike-riding grandma and a cybergeek brother named Kip.  The Dynamite parents are both conspicuosly absent.  Grandma and Kip treat him with a good deal of indifference and apathy.  Even Pedro, the gentle-natured Mexican boy he befriends, is indifferent to a degree.  Then one day Grandma injures herself while riding her dune bike, and Uncle Rico, a washed-up football player yearing for his glory days, commandeers the house.  Undoubtedly he's come to stay so that he can take advantage of Grandma's absence in order to give himself a break from living in his early 80's behemoth orange housevan.  Between eating all the red meat in the house and selling dubious goods door to door with Kip, Uncle Rico makes Napoleon live in complete mortification by screwing up his dating life and just embarrassing him in general.It gets better when Pedro decides to run for class president, but I'll let you watch and see!

628213,A1PCESNDC808ZM,B00005JNBQ,Charles Griffin,"[4, 6]","Okay, the first time I sat down and watched NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, my reaction was the same as many: ""What the heck was that?"" Aside from some occasional laughs, I wasn't impressed, dismissing the film as overrated and trying too hard to be quirky. But something odd happened. As weeks passed, moments from the film started creeping into my consciousness. Sure the one-liners were memorable, but I started to remember whole scenes...and actually laughing about it. Ironically, I began remembering NAPOLEON DYNAMITE more fondly than when I originally saw it. So I decided to view it again. It was as if I were watching it with completely different eyes. The film is basically a slice-of-life story about an awkward high school kid named Napoleon Dynamite and how he deals with life's little triumphs and defeats. Practically all the major characters...Napoleon's friends Deb and Pedro, his brother Kip and his uncle Rico have their quirks but none quite as colorful as Napoleon himself (so brilliantly played by Jon Heder).But while Napoleon can be characterized as nerdy, he lives so blissfully in his own world that it's hard to feel too sorry for him. Some viewers don't like him at all. They think he's too prickly or unsympathetic. But I like him very much. Napoleon (like Deb and Pedro) is a bit of an outsider and it's possible that's because of his personality, or perhaps his personality was born out of being CONSIDERED different...a sort of defense mechanism developed over time. Or maybe, I'm just reading too much into his character.There's no mistaking the fact that Napoleon, Deb and Pedro are outsiders. During the school dance, there's a moment in which the three characters are in the foreground watching everybody else on the dance floor. At first the shot seems trivial. But after another viewing, the moment really seemed to illustrate their isolation from everyone else. I could very well have been one of them. It was oddly touching.Yet this movie is no downer. After all, the characters don't ultimately fail at all. By staying true to their originality and always being themselves, they have their victorious moments. And the more invested you are in the characters, the more pleasing their victories become. My problem when first viewing this film is that I was expecting the laughs, as you would a normal comedy. But this comedy is anything but normal. As I viewed it the 2nd and 3rd times with a different perspective, it became much more humorous, touching and satisfying. I've seen the loser-becomes-a-winner story done before but never quite like this. There's nothing apologetic or sentimental about NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, which makes it all the more charming. When the ""Promise"" song starts to play during that last tether-ball scene, I actually get a little choked-up. I don't know why, and it's probably best not to analyze...let's just say I love this film!I'm not going to advise people to watch the film again if they absolutely hated it the first time. But if someday out of nowhere you think of a moment from this film and it makes you smile, I say give NAPOLEON DYNAMITE another try!",5,Watch without expectations!,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,3115,"['Okay', 'first', 'time', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'NAPOLEON', 'DYNAMITE', 'reaction', 'was', 'same', 'many', 'What', 'heck', 'was', 'occasional', 'laughs', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'dismissing', 'film', 'overrated', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'quirky', 'something', 'odd', 'happened', 'weeks', 'passed', 'moments', 'film', 'started', 'creeping', 'consciousness', 'Sure', 'one-liners', 'were', 'memorable', 'started', 'remember', 'whole', 'scenes', 'actually', 'laughing', 'Ironically', 'began', 'remembering', 'NAPOLEON', 'DYNAMITE', 'more', 'fondly', 'when', 'originally', 'saw', 'decided', 'view', 'again', 'was', 'were', 'watching', 'completely', 'different', 'eyes', 'film', 'basically', 'slice-of-life', 'story', 'awkward', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'named', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'how', 'life', 'little', 'triumphs', 'defeats', 'Practically', 'major', 'characters', 'Napoleon', 'friends', 'Deb', 'Pedro', 'brother', 'Kip', 'uncle', 'Rico', 'have', 'quirks', 'none', 'quite', 'as', 'colorful', 'Napoleon', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Jon', 'Heder', '.But', 'Napoleon', 'can', 'be', 'characterized', 'nerdy', 'so', 'blissfully', 'own', 'world', 'hard', 'feel', 'too', 'sorry', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'think', 'too', 'prickly', 'unsympathetic', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'Napoleon', 'Deb', 'Pedro', 'bit', 'outsider', 'possible', 'personality', 'perhaps', 'personality', 'was', 'born', 'being', 'CONSIDERED', 'different', 'sort', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'developed', 'time', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'character.There', 'mistaking', 'fact', 'Napoleon', 'Deb', 'Pedro', 'are', 'outsiders', 'school', 'dance', 'moment', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'foreground', 'watching', 'everybody', 'else', 'dance', 'floor', 'first', 'shot', 'trivial', 'viewing', 'moment', 'really', 'seemed', 'illustrate', 'isolation', 'everyone', 'else', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'was', 'oddly', 'touching.Yet', 'movie', 'downer', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'ultimately', 'fail', 'staying', 'true', 'originality', 'always', 'being', 'have', 'victorious', 'moments', 'more', 'invested', 'are', 'characters', 'more', 'pleasing', 'victories', 'become', 'problem', 'when', 'first', 'viewing', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'laughs', 'would', 'normal', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'anything', 'normal', 'viewed', '2nd', '3rd', 'times', 'different', 'perspective', 'became', 'much', 'more', 'humorous', 'touching', 'satisfying', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'loser-becomes-a-winner', 'story', 'done', 'never', 'quite', 'nothing', 'apologetic', 'sentimental', 'NAPOLEON', 'DYNAMITE', 'more', 'charming', 'When', 'Promise', 'song', 'play', 'last', 'tether-ball', 'scene', 'actually', 'get', 'little', 'choked-up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'probably', 'best', 'not', 'analyze', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'love', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'advise', 'people', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'first', 'time', 'someday', 'nowhere', 'think', 'moment', 'film', 'smile', 'say', 'give', 'NAPOLEON', 'DYNAMITE', 'try']",Napoleon Dynamite

When I finally did give it audience, it was in some hotel suite in LA, a soft robe, a few chuckles, then room service came, my girl came out of the shower, Napoleon went off, and I made a hazy mental note to give it a fair shot at some point.So, to speed things up a bit...the second time I thought it was very funny, the third time, funnier (and I don't mean just in retrospect, I laughed harder, and enjoyed it more).I've seen Napoleon like 20 times...eeezy!  It's going down in my regime of cult films with the likes of Office Space.  And, much like Office Space, it's no epic; there aren't any deep moral lessons to be had, any detailed historical accounting that will firm up your academic understanding of our place in the world.  Nope, just a concentrated dose of nostalgic hilarity.  Not in the sense that I wish I could be in High School again, or back in the 80's (a period that this film spoofs heavily), but more in the sense that it reminds you of simpler times and simpler concerns.  Nerd or not, most every reader cared deeply about the opinions of others then, about who they'd take to the dance, about whether they'd have to do ""all"" their chores (like feeding ham to their pet llama Tina).  I think if this movie - which is so oft accused of being devoid of plot - were to be forced to offer up some kind of lesson, or value, it should be just that:  it helps take our constellation of todays problems a bit less seriously by reminding us of how trivial yesterdays problems were.Plus it's got some sweet scenes!I'm sorry, but even if some disagree with my premise regarding this films value, how could anyone not find this movie flippin hilarious.  Napoleon Dynamite is NOT slapstick, it's infinitely less obvious.  That fact makes it harder for most to find the film immediately hilarious, but after a viewing or two, when your brain has ample time to digest the enormous volume of absurdity and texture, I think a good number of those who panned this film would be turned around.  This movie is an amalgamation of the High School experience, consolidated into various archetypes, then amplified to an extreme.Flippin awesome!If you don't agree with me, you should eat a decroded piece of crap!Enjoy,Christian HunterSanta Barbara, CaliforniaBTW:  Anyone who wants a Time Machine so they can go back to '82 should consult with me personally.

However, it has some key flaws - one-note characters and hardly any semblance of a plot - that take away from the film's enjoyability. It's a great setup for a movie, but all throughout, I found myself waiting for something better to happen.The film stars Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite, an intensely weird high school kid who is an outcast in every aspect of his life. He enjoys drawing imaginary animals, like unicorns and ligers, and basically hates everything else. He wants a girlfriend, but who would go out with him? He lives with his grandmother and his 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), who spends his days at home on internet chat rooms with his long-distance girlfriend.When Grandma Dynamite (Sandy Martin) goes down for the count after a dune buggy accident, Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) moves in to take care of the boys. Rico is about the only fully developed character in the movie, a man trying to get back to 1982 and change the way his life has turned out. Of course, his plan for turning his life around involves selling Tupperware door-to-door and buying a time machine on eBay.At school, Napoleon's buddy Pedro (Efren Ramirez) is running for class president against the most popular girl in school, Summer (Haylie Duff), while also swooping in and taking Deb (Tina Majorino) right out from underneath Napoleon's limp grasp.I liked this movie. I really did. There were a lot of hysterical parts, but unfortunately, those parts don't add up to a complete whole. The quirky characters were dying for better situations in which to apply their quirks, but all of the plot devices were gathered from stock.

He talks in a very deadpan way, has a bizarre family and has curious habits such as eating potato tots he stuffs in his pockets.The main plot from what I can tell is one of his friends(should I say one of his only friends) is running for class president which isn't even introduced until a good halfway or so in. So Napoleon wants to get him to win only they have to compete with Summer, one of those so popular for doing nothing girls that are in high school hallways.Then there's his bizarre brother(?) who spends a lot of time chatting to his woman on the internet. There's also his uncle who has some weird money making idea all the time and is one of those relatives that embarasses you just by being themselves.The acting isn't all that bad.

628233,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005JNBQ,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[115, 127]","In high school, I was one of the nameless, faceless rabble who drew little attention, maintained a low profile, and caused little trouble all in the hopes of getting out relatively unscathed, a goal I managed to accomplish, partly due to my sometimes intimidating presence, but mainly because I was able to fit in, sort of like a fish within a shoal...but there were those who weren't so fortunate, as obvious physical characteristics or personality traits (or both) tended to enunciate their presence regardless of vain attempts to `blend in' or enjoy the anonymity I, and those like me, tended to take for granted.  Napoleon Dynamite (2004) is a film about one of those individuals.The film, written and directed by Jared Hess, takes place in a small Idaho town and stars Jon Heder as the title character (he reminded me a lot of Timothy Busfield's character of Arnold Poindexter in the 1984 film Revenge of the Nerds).  Also appearing is Jon Gries (Real Genius, Fright Night Part II), Aaron Ruell, Efren Ramirez (Kazaam), Tina Majorino (she played the little girl with the map on her back in Kevin Costner's flopperino Waterworld), and Haylie Duff, sister to the more famous Hillary Duff, who both share a surname that's the same as Homer Simpson's favorite alcoholic beverage, Duff Beer.Napoleon Dynamite is an odd character for sure, with his shaggy red afro, moon boots (he wears them year `round), and t-shirts usually featuring those glossy iron-ons so popular in the 70's (he seems to purchase much of his wardrobe at the local thrift store) with a penchant for drawing mythical creatures, boasting about fictional girlfriends who live in other states (don't they always?), and touting his non-existent martial arts abilities, ""You know, there's like a b*tt-load of gangs at this school. This one gang kept wanting me to join because I'm pretty good with a bowstaff"".  Oh yeah, he breathes mostly through his mouth, and his vernacular includes, but isn't limited to, the liberal usage of such words like sweet, flippin', gosh, freakin', and heck, and he, along with his 32 year old brother Kip (Ruell), live with their grandmother, who owns a llama named Tina.  After an ATV accident sends grandma to the hospital, Uncle Rico (Gries) arrives to watch over the boys, and involves Kip in his schemes to make some sweet cash.  Napoleon, meanwhile, finds a friend in a newly arrived Hispanic student named Pedro (Ramirez) and he and their shy and kinda dorky friend Deb (Majorino) assist Pedro in his bid to become the next student body president, their competition being Summer (Duff), member of the cheerleading squad and the most popular girl in school.  Do the trio have a chance in beating the juggernaut that is Summer?  Perhaps, but it requires Napoleon to pull forth from within something no one would have realized he had, not even himself...The film is very odd...it's kind of a mix of the Coen brothers (Fargo, Raising Arizona), John Waters (Crybaby), and the earlier films of John Hughes (Sixteen Candles).  There's not much of a story at the beginning, more of a series of innocuous, unrelated, comical events, but later on we do see some development in this area with regards to Napoleon and Deb helping Pedro in his running for student body president.  Some scenes will make little or no sense in relation to what you may perceive as the story, so my recommendation is to just let it go, and enjoy the film for what it is, whatever it is...the real fun lies within Heder and his complete submersion into the character of Napoleon, wallowing in his own uncoolness.  Initially most will probably find him annoying and off-putting, but he sort of grew on me, and I actually found myself quietly rooting for him, in his most simple of endeavors (like trying to find a sweet fanny pack at the local thrift store), but don't get the wrong impression.  This isn't a triumphant nerd film (the nerd beats the jocks and/or gets the head cheerleader in the end), but a character-driven slice of weirdness that has a tendency to amuse.  The dialogue contains tons of quotable lines, and comes across genuine sense of realism.  The composed music by John Swihart and chosen pre-recorded material used to make the soundtrack complemented the film very well.  I think my favorite scene is when Napoleon discovers his uncle's crude time machine (which he purchased of the internet), and decides to give it a try...does it work?  Well, it does something, but I won't tell you what...one thing I really noticed was an absolute absence of profanity.  I'm not against its' usage in films, and have even become used to it (for better or worse), so it was kinda refreshing.The picture quality, presented in both 1.85:1 anamorphic wide screen and 1.33:1 full screen (both sides of the DVD are used), looks sharp and clear, with the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio coming through very well.  Special features are numerous and include a commentary track by the director/writer Hess, actor Heder, and producer Jeremy Coon, along with deleted scenes (with optional commentary), a short film entitled `Peluca' (basically the original concept for the character of Napoleon Dynamite, also with commentary), a number of MTV promotional spots, a still gallery, a featurette on the shooting of the final scene (keep watching the film after the credits to see a newly filmed 4 minute sequence shot a year after the film was released, made especially for the DVD release), and a promo for the FOX television series Arrested Development.  The special features are split between the two sides of the discs, so be sure to flip it over once you've finished one side.  My recommendation is to rent the film before buying, as it's not for everyone (I wouldn't bother showing it to my mother, as I know she wouldn't attempt to understand the where the humor comes from within this film).Cookieman108",4,"""I caught you a delicious bass.""",1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,5869,"['high', 'school', 'was', 'one', 'nameless', 'faceless', 'rabble', 'who', 'drew', 'little',

628235,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00005JNBQ,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 1]","Jared Hess's cult classic from 2004, Napoleon Dynamite, immediately drew me back to such films as Rushmore, Election, and Welcome To The Dollhouse- films that deal with high school life in comic ways. Yet, of those films, Napoleon Dynamite is probably the most off the wall. The film is set in director Hess's hometown of Preston, Idaho, in the southeastern corner of the state, not far from the Great Salt Lake. It is not a parody, but an absurdist tale, as none of the characters are in the least bit realistic. Napoleon Dynamite is the lead character's name (and yes, it sounds like the name of a loser from a bad punk rock band), and he is played by newcomer Jon Heder- a tall, red afro'd, four-eyed geek who is a not too good liar. He lives with his grandmother (Sandy Martin) and websurfing, geeky older brother Kipling (Aaron Ruell), until grandma wipes out in an ATV accident on sand dunes. Then, their uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to live with the boys. Rico is a bad Tupperware salesman who lives out of his aging van, and still wishes it was 1982, when he was a backup high school quarterback. He feels his coach's decision not to put him into the game denied him a shot at the NFL. Napoleon's school life is not much better. He's bullied by kids his age and younger, and makes only two friends- a Mexican kid named Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez), who's as passionless as his name is generic, but who has a sweet bicycle, can work up the courage to talk to girls, and has an real mustache, and a cute, but weird brunet girl named Deb (Tina Majorino), who attempts to run her own door-to-door Glamour Shots business.... The film is well written by Hess and his wife Jerusha, and there is a making of featurette not for the film, but the addendum wedding after the credits. This seems wholly in keeping with the film. There is also a commentary with Hess and Heder, but little of note is said, save for the fact that we learn Heder is married in real life, and Majorino (Deb) is a hip hop dance instructor. The film, however, tells much more than other films with seemingly similar subjects because it does not try.

If you are between 12-20 you might even like it more because this deals with high school kids primarily. However, there are some adults in here who play key roles, too.The teens and the adults have a couple of things in common: they are nerds and weird people and they are ALL hilarious. They also are unlike a cast of characters you have seen in any other movie. In other words, this movie is an ""original.""I didn't know any of these actors and I think that helped. It made it even more original, looking at new faces. That begins with the title character, played by Jon Heder. A white kid in Idaho with a afro haircut, over-sized glasses, moon boots and an unpredictable and low-key personality unlike anyone I've ever seen in other films. Even though he's pictured as a huge nerd, he surprises you all the time. Just when you think you have this kid figured out, he does something unexpected. Whatever, he's fun to watch and hear throughout the movie.Suffice to say ""Napoleon"" and about everyone in this film is totally whacked and all of them - male, female, young, old, good and bad people are extremely entertaining. A lot of the humor is visual, meaning the looks and reactions on these character's faces and the weird deadpan lines they deliver. Are there stereotypes in here?

628239,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JNBQ,Craig Matteson,"[8, 11]","Everyone comments on how strange this movie is.  However, my son and nephew assure me that this movie is not an exaggeration of how certain characters actually live.  After viewing this strange flick in more or less bewilderment, I thought about it.  I have come to believe that the strangeness of the flick is less the focus on some nerds than its treatment of them.  The movie doesn't make them the object of ridicule or irony.  And that is what is strange.  Whenever you see characters like these on the screen they are the butt of jokes, made ridiculous, or destroyed.Look, Napoleon and his family and friends are some of the weirdest people you will ever see on screen and maybe in real life as well.  You will find yourself mystified by their approach to their problems.  They seem to either not understand the way out of their situation or they lack the energy to get out.  Maybe it is both.  What you will love them for is that they do not knuckle under or accept the badge of loser that the ""cool"" kids want to impose on them.  My favorite scene involves Napoleon asking one of the bullies for one of Summer's campaign buttons and then heaving it down the hall.  Glory!Pedro is another great character.  Strange and great.  I mean, how could the desire to run for class president and the need to cut off one's hair because it is making you too hot reside in the same individual?The ending of the movie has more poetry in it than you might catch on first viewing.  Remember Pedro's campaign promise and then look closely at everything that happens as the movie ties things up.I recommend seeing this movie.  Just don't expect seeing anything like you have ever seen on screen before.  And if you find yourself rejecting the images at first, I encourage you to stick with it.  I think you will get it by the end.  Younger folks seem to get it easily.

That's partly how comedies, especially satires, tend to work, Roger.  Besides, in the case of Napoleon Dynamite that's not even the whole story.Napoleon Dynamite's success is not contingent on whether or not you feel superior to any of its characters.  Its success lies in the way it manages to strike a dissonant chord with people who feel as though they don't belong anywhere and feel alienated.That is the point of the lama, you see?  It's a markedly alien being in a markedly alien environment.  The same thing holds true for the chicken farm where Napoleon is seen trying to stick two chickens inside a cage where they don't belong.  The same thing holds true for Pedro who is a Mexican stuck in a strange land.  The same holds true for Uncle Rico who is stuck in the early 80's and in a past he never even had and the same is true of Kip, who's been chatting with chicks online (a virtual world) the whole day, dreams of being a cage fighter (while possessing a less than intimidating physique and molasses like reflexes) and  eventually finds his way home by becoming ""black"" and heading to the city.  The same thing holds true of the bodybuilder Starla, who looks as much at home in the Midwest scenery as the lama does and the same thing holds true of Napoleon's 1970's disco suit and the liger.  And I could go on and on and on.Napoleon Dynamite is obviously a movie about alienation and for my money, it is every bit as great as ""The Royal Tennenbaums"", a movie that is all about recognition and admission.",5,A work of staggering genius.

I have seen it a couple more times now; I think it is going to become a cult classic.  Genuis is the best way to describe the writing and directing in this film.  Simple and funny are two words that describe the story.  But there are a few more words that can be included: daring, brilliant, and creative.Napoleon Dynamite creators, Jared Hess and his wife, manage to offer a story touching on so many real-life high school and rural living situations that hit close-to-home for most people.  Some my find the situations almost too close to home.  I found the entire film to be enjoyable entertainment.Napoleon is definitley a nerd.  But he is a nerd searching for a way to make his life a little better; he is trying to stand up to his ""looney"" grandmother (at least I think that's who she was), deal with his strangely-geekier-than-Napoleon-himself brother Kip, and fight off the bullies who attack him day after day.  He makes friends with another loner named Pedro, a guy who appears addicted to downers, thought I don't think that's included in the storyline.Napoleon's uncle Rico ends up coming to visit, and this adds more difficult times for poor Napoleon.  I think each of these characters, including Pedro's and Napoleon's love interests in the movie, interact so well together that the story almost seems like it is a documentary - a bit of an exaggerated documentary though.It is really cool to watch Napoleon deal with so many situations, which aren't really earth-shattering events, but he treats them as they are.  He handles problems Napoleon's way, and that gives this film a unique freshness that grows on the viewer.This is a movie that has to be watched more than once to completely grasp its creative juices.  I think John Heder plays this role so well that it may be hard for him to ever be himself again.  Many people will always call him Napoleon from now on.  I would love to see a part two and part three.  Heck, what about a weekly television show!  Napoleon may be one of the most memorable characters to come out of a film since Silence of the Lambs' ""Hannibel the Cannibal"".Like I said earlier, I didn't ""get"" this film upon a first look, but after another viewing I really think this independent film is going to LAUNCH the career of Jared Hess to a new level.If you haven't seen Napoleon Dynamite, I suggest you give it a try.  If the first time you watch it, it seems a little ""off"", give it one more try.

Napoleon is hazed at school, envies Pedro's mustache, lies about having a gorgeous girl friend, and musters his best compliment to Deb at the dance: ""I like your sleeves; they're big.""

This C movie, C because it has a budget cheaper than a B movie, is almost a twisted version of ""Leave it to Beaver"" without the hominess of the 1950's nuclear family. The Dynamite family is a fractured group of relatives living in the wide-open spaces of Idaho surrounded by farms. The High School and community seem to be in a time warp since the ""hip kids"" in school actually look relatively like squares particularly the designated good looking guy antagonist who looks like he is sporting popular fashions from the mid 60's and he looks like Eddie Haskell (Leave it to Beaver) if Eddie had worked out (Son of Eddie?). Napoleon is handicapped by a family without parents that are never mentioned, he lives with his 32 year old unemployed computer nerd brother, his tough often absent grandmother, a sleazy visiting uncle who still wishes it was 1982 and he was a HS quarterback, all made worse by their poor economic situation. In addition, Napoleon has a tall-uncoordinated body, ill-fitting clothes, a bad haircut, an often-scrunched leer of a face and he possesses severely limited social skills. He is hopelessly antagonistic towards the in crowd, who he tries to combat by using over way over the top sarcasm. Although aware of his limitations, he naively strikes forward in attempts at dating and political school relationships. The movie is full of stilted dialogue that is sometimes painful (""you gonna eat your tots?)but fitting with the characters. The movie meshes surprisingly well with Napoleon and his friends Pedro, who runs for School President, and Deb, the nerd princess who pleasantly turn into an attractive young girl, surprisingly making headway although fighting extreme odds. Somehow this low budget flick got Hillary Duff's sister to play the antagonist sweet girl. A unique feature of the film is the periodic cameo like appearances of Pedro's cool and hip and slightly dangerous looking older cousins in a real ""boss car"" with great sounds. The cousins seemed to have transcended from our time into this Idaho time warp making their brief appearances startling but effective. On first take as an adult, you may reject this movie, but watching it with your kids you are more likely to pick up on this ultimate stark underdog movie that is extraordinarily unique.

The characters are carefully selected and well portrayed, situations and dialogs flawlessly written without a blank spot, superfluous scenes or empty dialogs. There is not too much of a plot because nothing ever happens in here - the main events are concentrated around the teenage dating attempts, who to take to the big dance, and the class president election at the local high school.This movie offers intelligent humor in it's best; most big production releases with it's toilet type jokes can't even distantly touch what writers of Napoleon Dynamite were able to do here with minimum budget and little known cast. It appears that people who rate this movie so poorly are divided into two main groups; those who are not able to find any meaningful plot and so they condemn it, and those who seem to judge it way too quickly - and then throw it together into the same bin with Beavis & Butthead type humor - because the teenage characters and small town similarity... these two things are the only common points.This title is worth your attention and time; my wife and I watched the movie quite a few times and so far we didn't get bored - it is funny & sweet at the same time; hopefully you'll be able to find your way to like Napoleon, Pedro, Deb and others for exactly what they are, and accept their strengths and weaknesses.",5,Vote for Pedro!

628260,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B00005JNBQ,David E. Levine,"[1, 5]","I have seen a number of strange, quirky comedies and, if you can get into them, they can be good. I think that this is a great movie but, the problem is I can't figure out why. Is one of these movies that's so bad it actually beomes good in a kitchy sort of way or, is it really good? I haven't figured out the answer but, regardless, I really liked it and for those who can get into strange comedies, I highly recommend it. John Heder plays Napoleon, a totally deadpan nerd who speaks in a monotone throughout. He is a highschool student in Preston, Idaho, kind of a dreary looking place which has as much personality as does Napoleon. No matter what happens to him, no matter what bully is pushing him around, the deadpan demeanor never changes. He has an older brother at home and a strange, thrill seeking grandmother. When the grandmother ends up hospitalized, she has their uncle stay with them. Now, you have to understand that the nerdy older brother is about 32 yet, nontheless, he and Napoleon need someone to stay with them. By the way, this uncle is quite a piece of work, priding himself as a would have been professional football player who never got a break. Also, he and Napoleon's brother hook up in some offbeat money making schemes.The big brother is not the same type of character that Napoleon is but, in his own way, he is equally a nerd, as he sits at the computer chatting with his online girlfriend. When his girlfriend arrives, by bus, from a distant city, she does not appear to be his type, indeed she is quite a surprise. OK, you can see it coming so maybe it's not such a surprise. Anyway, the two get along famously which adds more comedy to the movie.There is a new kid at school, Pedro, and, with a Spanish accent, he too is as big a nerd as you can be. Lie Napoleon, he too is deadpan, barely reacting to events. However, he gets an inspiration; to run for class president. In his way, Napoleon helps him with the campaign against a snotty, blond princess named Summer. Does Napoleon ever, even briefly, break out of his deadpan? You'll have to see this movie to find out.Also, to some extent, Napoleon has a romatic interest. He tries to get a date to a dance with one of the good looking, hot girls at school and, by some wierd quirk, he actually does. But, there is a friendship with a female nerd who fits in perfectly with Napoleon and Pedro. Is this friendship a romance? Oh, I don't know. The plot isn't involved enough to really delve in to such things. However, for the right, offbeat sense of humor, who needs a plot? The peculiar, quirky characters and situations are enough.",5,Is it so bad that it's good?,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,2620,"['have', 'seen', 'number', 'strange', 'quirky', 'comedies', 'can', 'get', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'one', 'movies', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'good', 'kitchy', 'sort', 'way', 'really', 'good', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'answer', 'regardless', 'really', 'liked', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'strange', 'comedies', 'highly', 'recommend', 'John', 'Heder', 'Napoleon', 'totally', 'deadpan', 'nerd', 'who', 'monotone', 'highschool', 'student', 'Preston', 'Idaho', 'kind', 'dreary', 'looking', 'place', 'as', 'much', 'personality', 'Napoleon', 'matter', 'what', 'matter', 'what', 'bully', 'pushing', 'around', 'deadpan', 'demeanor', 'never', 'changes', 'older', 'brother', 'home', 'strange', 'thrill', 'seeking', 'grandmother', 'When', 'grandmother', 'up', 'hospitalized', 'uncle', 'stay', 'Now', 'have', 'understand', 'nerdy', 'older', 'brother', '32', 'yet', 'nontheless', 'Napoleon', 'need', 'someone', 'stay', 'way', 'uncle', 'quite', 'piece', 'work', 'priding', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'professional', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'break', 'Also', 'Napoleon', 'brother', 'hook', 'up', 'offbeat', 'money', 'making', 'schemes.The', 'big', 'brother', 'not', 'same', 'type', 'character', 'Napoleon', 'own', 'way', 'equally', 'nerd', 'computer', 'chatting', 'online', 'girlfriend', 'When', 'girlfriend', 'arrives', 'bus', 'distant', 'city', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'type', 'indeed', 'quite', 'surprise', 'OK', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'so', 'maybe', 'not', 'such', 'surprise', 'Anyway', 'two', 'get', 'famously', 'more', 'comedy', 'movie.There', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'Pedro', 'Spanish', 'accent', 'too', 'as', 'big', 'nerd', 'can', 'be', 'Lie', 'Napoleon', 'too', 'deadpan', 'barely', 'reacting', 'events', 'However', 'inspiration', 'run', 'class', 'president', 'way', 'Napoleon', 'campaign', 'snotty', 'blond', 'princess', 'named', 'Summer', 'Does', 'Napoleon', 'ever', 'even', 'briefly', 'break', 'deadpan', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'find', 'out.Also', 'extent', 'Napoleon', 'romatic', 'interest', 'get', 'date', 'dance', 'one', 'good', 'looking', 'hot', 'girls', 'school', 'wierd', 'quirk', 'actually', 'friendship', 'female', 'nerd', 'who', 'perfectly', 'Napoleon', 'Pedro', 'friendship', 'romance', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'plot', ""n't"", 'involved', 'enough', 'really', 'delve', 'such', 'things', 'However', 'right', 'offbeat', 'sense', 'humor', 'who', 'plot', 'peculiar', 'quirky', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'enough']",Napoleon Dynamite

628262,AL2ZCI11JEROS,B00005JNBQ,David,"[4, 4]","""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the kind of movie that makes some people laugh until they cry, and some people not believe they spent good money for such a boring, unfunny film. The words that come to mind are ""one man's trash is another man's treasure."" Whether you will like this film depends on how willing you are to laugh at those more unfortunate than you.The movie centers around a sleepy farming town in Idaho where Napoleon, a tall, awkward high school student who sports a a light brown 'fro, big glasses, and moonboots lives. His eyes are always squinted, almost shut completely, as if the sun is blinding him all day. He lives with his also bespectacled brother Kip and manly Grandma, though his sleazy, scheming Uncle Rico takes care of him and Kip when Grandma breaks her cocyx in an accident. He seems to have no friends until he meets Pedro, a moustached kid of Mexican descent who starts going to Napoleons high school. Along the way, he also befriends Deb, a ponytailed shy girl. Eventually, Napoleon helps Pedro try to run in the school elections, but overall the movie feels more like a series of hilarious skits with a vaugue plot than a true movie held together by strong themes. This actually works, once again, depending on if you are willing to laugh at the things Napoleon says and does, things that aren't really supposed to be funny. Most of the people who disliked this movie say it is cruel to the ""nerdy"" characters and their awkward actions that the audience laughs at. But the makers of this film are actually showing sympathy towards the characters, and much of the film is just the truth, taken from the writer's childhood experiences. If you have a broad sense of humor and see this movie with that in mind, Napoleon Dynamite may make you laugh till you can't laugh no more.",5,Hilarious,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,1801,"['Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'kind', 'movie', 'people', 'cry', 'people', 'not', 'believe', 'spent', 'good', 'money', 'boring', 'unfunny', 'film', 'words', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'one', 'man', 'trash', 'man', 'treasure', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'how', 'willing', 'are', 'laugh', 'more', 'unfortunate', 'you.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'sleepy', 'farming', 'town', 'Idaho', 'where', 'Napoleon', 'tall', 'awkward', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'sports', 'light', 'brown', ""'fro"", 'big', 'glasses', 'moonboots', 'lives', 'eyes', 'are', 'always', 'squinted', 'almost', 'shut', 'completely', 'sun', 'blinding', 'day', 'also', 'bespectacled', 'brother', 'Kip', 'manly', 'Grandma', 'sleazy', 'scheming', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'care', 'Kip', 'when', 'Grandma', 'cocyx', 'accident', 'have', 'friends', 'Pedro', 'moustached', 'kid', 'Mexican', 'descent', 'who', 'going', 'Napoleons', 'high', 'school', 'way', 'also', 'Deb', 'ponytailed', 'shy', 'girl', 'Eventually', 'Napoleon', 'Pedro', 'try', 'run', 'school', 'elections', 'movie', 'more', 'series', 'hilarious', 'skits', 'vaugue', 'plot', 'true', 'movie', 'held', 'together', 'strong', 'themes', 'actually', 'once', 'again', 'depending', 'are', 'willing', 'laugh', 'things', 'Napoleon', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'disliked', 'movie', 'say', 'cruel', 'nerdy', 'characters', 'awkward', 'actions', 'audience', 'makers', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'showing', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'much', 'film', 'just', 'truth', 'taken', 'writer', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'have', 'broad', 'sense', 'humor', 'see', 'movie', 'mind', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'may', 'make', 'laugh', 'till', 'ca', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'more']",Napoleon Dynamite

I was definitely not in the popular crowd in high school, I just kind of existed.  But I remember kids taking beatings and abuse all the time for just being themselves.  Napoleon is just such a character.  His hair looks like he hasn't brushed it in years, he openly breathes through his mouth annoyingly, he stores the cafeteria's tater tots in a fanny pack to eat later in class, he has terrible glasses and answers every question seemingly with a mini tantrum, as if it was the stupidest question he had ever heard.  This attitude, along with his appearance, make him a complete loser in school.There isn't much of a storyline, just Napoleon's interactions during the film with some weird characters.  His brother is a chat room addict, his uncle can't stop thinking of 1982, when he was a high school jock and just missed on his big chance, he has a new friend at the school, a mexican student named Pedro, who is just as quiet and withdrawn as he is.  Eventually Pedro will decide to run for class president and Napoleon will help him.  This brings about the only semblance of a climax to the film, but otherwise, it is just Napoleon and ""the lovely state of Idaho"" on display here.This is not a bad film.  It is not great, at least not to me.  I teach in a high school now and saw the movie basically because my class talked about it all the time.  I can't say that I know any Napoleons at the high school I teach at, but he's probably there, calling everybody an idiot and going outside to feed his grandmother's llama.

It seemed like it was just a bunch of slack jawed vacant eyed losers standing around for an hour and a half. However something within me said to go back and watch it again, simply because everyone had said it was so brilliant. I rarely listen to anybody on matters of taste but I decided to re-watch it because the movie was already sinking it's tentacles into me.It became better and better with every watching. I don't know how it does it...but that's the effect it has. All I know is I swore I'd never watch it again and now I own it.What this movie really is is an atlas of the lost types of people that exist in dullsville towns like Preston Idaho. It captures the ennui of these places and takes you into the mind of a weird dude who is a non conformist in a cornfed place where this is in new way a good thing. All of the people in this movie are lost, even with those who are supposed to be cool had a somewhat desperate and pathetic feeling to them. You know that as bad as they can be they'll wind up stuck in this village for life living off their faded glory like Uncle Rico. But then it was easy for me to feel that way living out West. Summer Wheatly may rule Preston high but she would be just another person at the school dance here in California. See the cartoon 'Totally Spies' for any further information on the types of uber preps we have in this place.It's also a great freakshow. Napoleon with his tot obessions and bo staff skills, Kip and his internet stalking, Pedro and the holy chip scene that never got put in but should have and above all...REX KWON DO.A great 'loser' movie. Like if Beavis and Butthead were brought to life and then somehow made into even bigger outcasts than before. But I can't give it 5 stars because it like it's setting seems lethargic.

Yet such is indeed the case with the extremely strange NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE, a movie so. . .different. . .it's still creating a buzz, as evidenced by the 1400 reviews here (and counting).Napolean (Jon Heder).

628278,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B00005JNBQ,DonAthos,"[2, 5]","Napoleon Dynamite will be remembered far into the future. By some, at least, to whom this movie will sit comfortably alongside similar ""cult"" type movies. Others-most, I'd suspect-will watch it and wonder what all the fuss is about. And so, you must ask yourself: what group do you most likely fall into? Are you into the cult-type films? Or more mainstream than that? Your answer to that question probably answers how you'll feel about this movie.The main problem with the movie, it seems to me, is that it isn't really about anything in particular, plot-wise. Rather, it's a collection of character sketches, loosely tied together by a plot that feels tacked-on because the writer realized that he needed a plot of some sort. Whether Napoleon's friend Pedro does, or does not, win his election (which provides the climax to the movie), is almost completely irrelevant to the film as a whole. Except for the cool `Vote for Pedro' shirts that some people wear now, the election could have been totally removed from the film and I expect that it would seem basically the same. It could also be said that ""Napoleon finding someone to connect with"" is also what the film is about, but really, it's not. That may or may not happen over the course of the film, but Napoleon's character is, himself, so lukewarm about his relationships that it can't really provide a focus.As a collection of character sketches, the movie is hit or miss. A lot of the characters are very broadly drawn and seem cartoonish. The tone of the film, itself, is not cartoony or slapstick or absurd-it seems to want to portray reality in some way. And so the characters and the film appear to clash at times, providing an interesting if slightly disturbing experience.And so: why will this film achieve cult status, and why is it so popular? Because the main character sketch-Napoleon Dynamite, himself-is brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed. Otherwise, this is not particularly a great film, per se. The story is inconsequential, it teaches little to nothing, the writing is average, the direction forgettable, the acting passable to silly, etc. But what it does do is it creates an Icon. Napoleon Dynamite will be remembered because the eponymous character will be remembered. Napoleon Dynamite is a nerd protagonist, but (and strikingly different from the norm) he is not a hero. He really isn't even likable, and is kind of a jerk. Vastly different from, say, the Tri-Lambda house, who were nerds out of a sense of self and integrity and ""being who they are,"" Napoleon is the way he is either out of a philosophical myopia or, because strangely, he's trying to be cool. He's kind of like an arrogant jock character in that he looks down on most people; they differ because 1) no one agrees with Napoleon's sense of the cool and 2) jocks are strong enough to enforce their ideas and Napoleon isn't. Of course, underneath his (ineffectual, funny) bluster, we can see that (just like most of the arrogant jocks) he suffers from low-self esteem and looks for others approval to validate him. That's why he lies about things like ""hunting for wolverines."" In short, Napoleon isn't a movie-nerd, heroic and decent, just misunderstood; he's a real-nerd, struggling and sometimes self-loathing with a patina of false-pride. We have, all of us, known a Napoleon Dynamite at one point or another in our lives, and we've always wondered: why? This movie doesn't ever really answer that question, but it does show us enough reality that we have some evidence upon which to guess. And that's pretty cool.",3,"Not a Great Movie, but an Iconic Character",1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,3575,"['Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'far', 'future', 'least', 'whom', 'movie', 'will', 'sit', 'comfortably', 'alongside', 'similar', 'cult', 'type', 'movies', 'Others-most', ""'d"", 'suspect-will', 'watch', 'wonder', 'what', 'fuss', 'so', 'must', 'ask', 'what', 'group', 'do', 'most', 'likely', 'fall', 'Are', 'cult-type', 'films', 'more', 'mainstream', 'answer', 'question', 'probably', 'how', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'movie.The', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'particular', 'plot-wise', 'Rather', 'collection', 'character', 'sketches', 'loosely', 'tied', 'together', 'plot', 'tacked-on', 'writer', 'realized', 'needed', 'plot', 'sort', 'Whether', 'Napoleon', 'friend', 'Pedro', 'not', 'win', 'election', 'climax', 'movie', 'almost', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'film', 'whole', 'cool', 'Vote', 'Pedro', 'shirts', 'people', 'wear', 'now', 'election', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'removed', 'film', 'expect', 'would', 'seem', 'basically', 'same', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'Napoleon', 'finding', 'someone', 'connect', 'also', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'happen', 'course', 'film', 'Napoleon', 'character', 'so', 'lukewarm', 'relationships', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'provide', 'focus.As', 'collection', 'character', 'sketches', 'movie', 'hit', 'miss', 'lot', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'broadly', 'drawn', 'seem', 'cartoonish', 'tone', 'film', 'not', 'cartoony', 'slapstick', 'absurd-it', 'want', 'portray', 'reality', 'way', 'so', 'characters', 'film', 'appear', 'clash', 'times', 'providing', 'interesting', 'slightly', 'disturbing', 'experience.And', 'so', 'why', 'will', 'film', 'achieve', 'cult', 'status', 'why', 'so', 'popular', 'main', 'character', 'sketch-Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'himself-is', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'flawlessly', 'executed', 'Otherwise', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'film', 'se', 'story', 'inconsequential', 'little', 'nothing', 'writing', 'average', 'direction', 'forgettable', 'acting', 'passable', 'silly', 'etc', 'what', 'do', 'Icon', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'eponymous', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'nerd', 'protagonist', 'strikingly', 'different', 'norm', 'not', 'hero', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'likable', 'kind', 'jerk', 'Vastly', 'different', 'say', 'Tri-Lambda', 'house', 'who', 'were', 'nerds', 'sense', 'self', 'integrity', 'being', 'who', 'are', 'Napoleon', 'way', 'philosophical', 'myopia', 'strangely', 'trying', 'be', 'cool', 'kind', 'arrogant', 'jock', 'character', 'down', 'most', 'people', 'differ', '1', 'one', 'Napoleon', 'sense', 'cool', '2', 'jocks', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'enforce', 'ideas', 'Napoleon', ""n't"", 'course', 'ineffectual', 'funny', 'bluster', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'most', 'arrogant', 'jocks', 'low-self', 'esteem', 'others', 'approval', 'validate', 'why', 'things', 'hunting', 'wolverines', 'short', 'Napoleon', ""n't"", 'movie-nerd', 'heroic', 'decent', 'just', 'misunderstood', 'real-nerd', 'struggling', 'sometimes', 'self-loathing', 'patina', 'false-pride', 'have', 'known', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'one', 'point', 'lives', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'movie', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'answer', 'question', 'show', 'enough', 'reality', 'have', 'evidence', 'guess', 'pretty', 'cool']",Napoleon Dynamite

The disc jockeys said it was destine to be a cult classic. So, I had to rent it.I found out, Napoleon Dynamite (John Heder) is actually a person. Napoleon's appearance is right out of the 80's. I thought this movie was set in the early 1980's. But when Napoleon said Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) is stuck in 1982 the setting had to be present day. There are so many quotable phrases like gosh and freakin' idiot that they might become part of normal conversation.Napoleon is a high school geek. He is no longer affected by any cut down remarks or being picked on by his schoolmates. He reciprocates with his own gestures and comments. Other characters include Napoleon's love interest Deb (Tina Majorino), his 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and school friend Pedro. (Efren Ramirez) Are they all geeks or unique in their own way? But all of these characters are relatable to everyone now or from the past. That is why this movie is so interesting.

This guy is really like no one I have ever seen.Napolean  is a young man who lives with his grandmother and 32 year old brother in a small town in Idaho.  His days consist of feeding their llama, seeking out odd jobs (they include working in a chicken farm, hearding the creatures into cages and analyzing glasses of milk to determine what the cows consumed before they were milked), and just trying to survive the ups and downs (mostly downs) of high school life.  Napolean encounters fellow geek Pedro (Efren Ramirez), recently uprooted from his native Mexico, and helps him run for class president.  Napolean also encounters Deb (Tina Majorino), a shy aspiring glamor shot photographer, who becomes his friend.This film is filled with a kind of humor best-described as ""off the wall"" and ""subtle"" (to say the least).

628295,A3VTWN2JH8UNV8,B00005JNBQ,Dustin Perry,"[9, 13]","The summer movie season is gone and with it came the usual onslaught of action flicks, big-budget thrillers and even a few hilarious comedies. Matt Damon, Will Smith, Tom Cruise, Tobey Maguire and Will Ferrell all had big hits. However, in the midst of all the robots, amnesiac hit men, mustachioed newscasters and web slinging, a different kind of leading man set quite a unique landmark: Filmdom has a new reigning nerd, and his name is Napoleon Dynamite.Newcomer Jon Heder stars as the protagonist in the title role of director Jared Hess' debut film about a tall, moon boot-wearing geek with thick glasses and a curly red hairdo trying to make it through his high school days in rural Idaho. He lives with his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), an equally clueless loser who spends his days chatting with babes on the Internet, and their grandmother, a four-wheeler enthusiast played by Sandy Martin.After an accident in the sand dunes leaves granny with a broken coccyx, Napoleon and Kip's uncle Rico (Jon Gries) becomes their temporary caretaker. Uncle Rico assumes this responsibility the only way he knows how: by showing the boys boring videos of himself throwing footballs past the camera (his team almost won State in 1982) and recruiting Kip to help him sell plastic kitchenware and breast enlargement pills door-to-door.In between receiving nonstop ridicule and alienation from his classmates, Napoleon spends most of his spare time touting his nunchaku skills, drawing flatulent fantasy creatures, feeding his pet llama Tina scraps of ham, sloppily chugging cranberry juice, testing out a time machine Kip bought online (complete with power crystals) and learning ""flippin' sweet moves"" from an ancient hip-hop dance tape he finds at a thrift store.Rest assured, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" does have a plot, minimal as it may be. He befriends Mexican transfer student Pedro (Efren Ramirez) and manages his campaign to run for class president against the token popular girl Summer (played by Hillary Duff's sister, Haylie). There's even a love interest for Napoleon named Deb (Tina Majorino), a quirky girl who wears a ponytail on the side of her head and specializes in Glamour Shots photography and making cheap vinyl key chains.You'll be too busy, however, watching Heder steal every single scene he's in while at the same time, destroying all the clich&eacute;s of how characters like him are supposed to act. After all, any movie nerd can have a pocket protector and fawn over Gillian Anderson, but how many have ever stuffed tater tots in their pocket or tied fishing line to an action figure and dragged it from a moving school bus? Add to that Heder's throaty, deadpan delivery of lines like ""Are you drinking 1 percent milk because you think you're fat?"" and what you end up with is a new cinematic hero for the Star Trek-quoting, comic book-collecting masses.Hess' directorial style and dialogue have drawn comparisons to both Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and Todd Solondz's ""Welcome to the Dollhouse."" But his film has indie cred coming from almost every angle and just enough slapstick (including a hilarious cameo by Diedrich Bader as the instructor of his own brand of martial arts, Rex Kwon Do) to distance itself as an extremely original and entertaining movie.If you want to see this hidden gem of a movie (and I highly recommend you do) you'd better hurry because it's likely to be knocked out of theaters soon by the slew of upcoming blockbusters that, most likely, won't contain any tater tots or llamas.",5,Napoleon Dynamite ended the summer movie season with a bang!,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,3525,"['summer', 'movie', 'season', 'gone', 'came', 'usual', 'onslaught', 'action', 'flicks', 'big-budget', 'thrillers', 'even', 'few', 'hilarious', 'comedies', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'had', 'big', 'hits', 'However', 'midst', 'robots', 'amnesiac', 'hit', 'men', 'mustachioed', 'newscasters', 'web', 'slinging', 'different', 'kind', 'leading', 'man', 'set', 'quite', 'unique', 'landmark', 'Filmdom', 'new', 'reigning', 'nerd', 'name', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite.Newcomer', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'protagonist', 'title', 'role', 'director', 'Jared', 'Hess', 'debut', 'film', 'tall', 'moon', 'boot-wearing', 'geek', 'thick', 'glasses', 'curly', 'red', 'hairdo', 'trying', 'make', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'rural', 'Idaho', 'older', 'brother', 'Kip', 'Aaron', 'Ruell', 'equally', 'clueless', 'loser', 'who', 'days', 'chatting', 'babes', 'Internet', 'grandmother', 'four-wheeler', 'enthusiast', 'played', 'Sandy', 'Martin.After', 'accident', 'sand', 'granny', 'broken', 'coccyx', 'Napoleon', 'Kip', 'uncle', 'Rico', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'temporary', 'caretaker', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'responsibility', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'showing', 'boys', 'boring', 'videos', 'throwing', 'footballs', 'camera', 'team', 'almost', 'won', 'State', '1982', 'recruiting', 'Kip', 'help', 'sell', 'plastic', 'kitchenware', 'breast', 'enlargement', 'door-to-door.In', 'receiving', 'nonstop', 'ridicule', 'alienation', 'classmates', 'Napoleon', 'most', 'spare', 'time', 'touting', 'nunchaku', 'skills', 'drawing', 'flatulent', 'fantasy', 'creatures', 'feeding', 'pet', 'llama', 'Tina', 'scraps', 'ham', 'sloppily', 'chugging', 'cranberry', 'juice', 'testing', 'out', 'time', 'machine', 'Kip', 'bought', 'online', 'complete', 'power', 'crystals', 'learning', 'flippin', 'sweet', 'moves', 'ancient', 'hip-hop', 'dance', 'tape', 'thrift', 'store.Rest', 'assured', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'have', 'plot', 'minimal', 'may', 'be', 'Mexican', 'transfer', 'student', 'Pedro', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'campaign', 'run', 'class', 'president', 'token', 'popular', 'girl', 'Summer', 'played', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'sister', 'Haylie', 'even', 'love', 'interest', 'Napoleon', 'named', 'Deb', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'quirky', 'girl', 'who', 'ponytail', 'side', 'head', 'Glamour', 'Shots', 'photography', 'making', 'cheap', 'vinyl', 'key', 'chains.You', ""'ll"", 'be', 'too', 'busy', 'however', 'watching', 'Heder', 'steal', 'single', 'scene', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'destroying', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'act', 'movie', 'nerd', 'can', 'have', 'pocket', 'protector', 'fawn', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'how', 'many', 'have', 'ever', 'stuffed', 'tater', 'tots', 'pocket', 'tied', 'fishing', 'line', 'action', 'figure', 'dragged', 'moving', 'school', 'bus', 'Add', 'Heder', 'throaty', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'lines', 'Are', 'drinking', '1', 'percent', 'milk', 'think', ""'re"", 'fat', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'new', 'cinematic', 'hero', 'Star', 'Trek-quoting', 'comic', 'book-collecting', 'masses.Hess', 'directorial', 'style', 'dialogue', 'have', 'drawn', 'comparisons', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Rushmore', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'film', 'indie', 'cred', 'coming', 'almost', 'angle', 'just', 'enough', 'slapstick', 'including', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'instructor', 'own', 'brand', 'martial', 'arts', 'Rex', 'Kwon', 'Do', 'distance', 'extremely', 'original', 'entertaining', 'movie.If', 'want', 'see', 'hidden', 'gem', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'do', ""'d"", 'better', 'hurry', 'likely', 'be', 'knocked', 'theaters', 'soon', 'slew', 'upcoming', 'blockbusters', 'most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'contain', 'tater', 'tots', 'llamas']",Napoleon Dynamite

Most of the characters in the movie are extremely strange and are social outcasts. The humor is mostly deadpan instead of charasmatic and wacky. It is probably the most popular among teens even though most teens probably don't relate with Napoleon or anyone else in the movie. It's a very different kind of movie which probably helps contribute to its popularity.The movie really doesn't have a story. It's basically just about Napoleons everyday life. Napoleon Dynamite is an outcast. Most nerds usually have other nerdy friends but Napoleon doesn't even have those until a new Hispanic student named Pedro arrives. He also becomes friends with a girl named Deb. His life becomes even more miserable with the arrival of his Uncle Rico who constantly screws up things for Napoleon. He stays with Napoleon and his thirtysomething year old brother Kip while their grandma recovers from and accident at the sand dunes.Napoleon Dynamite is played by Jon Heder, who turns in one the best comedic performances of all time. He makes Napoleon depressed, nerdy and very unlikable. Hes not the kind of person you would wanna hang out with but somehow you root for him throughout the movie. There is something appealing about him thats hard to put a finger on. Hes a unique, memorable, and very quotable character that's not easy to forget.Aaron Ruell plays Napoleons even nerdier brother Kip. He's not as relaxed as Napoleon and he spends all day chating online with his internet girlfriend when hes not helping Uncle Rico sell tupperware. Efren Ramirez plays Pedro. He always has a blank look on his face and is even more out of it than Napoleon. Jon Gries plays Uncle Rico. Hes probably the most annoying character in the movie. Hes constantly looking for ways to make money and wishes he could relive his college football days. Tina Majorino plays Deb, Napoleon's potential girlfriend. She looks nerdy in the movie but is actually very cute in real life.

Both are centered around a character conventionally described as a ""nerd,"" ""geek,"" ""dork,"" etc.---adolescent pariahs.  Solondz's however is a far darker vision: he treats all of his characters mercilessly, his knife cuts in all directions and the audience is left squirming and cringing the whole way through.  Hess's film while also reveling in long drawn-out awkward moments, is far more forgiving---in fact, if anything it can be faulted for sugarcoating and copping out with the humorous but implausible happy ending.  Yes there is some amount of self-consicously hip dork-worship but he doesn't overdo it, in contrast to films like ""Rushmore.""Hess treats every one of his characters gently, even as he teases them and exposes all of their flaws.  We do squirm, but not to the extent that we have to look away from the screen like with a Todd Solondz movie---there is no element of sadism present.  So the gentleness extends to the viewer too.

The primary goal of this breed continues to be to find acceptance among peers they have empowered to be their superiors by the will of their own self-consciousness. Napoleon Dynamite is merely the latest incarnation in this 2004 MTV-produced comedy. The movie has nice visual touches (like the food-oriented opening credits) and some funny moments, a few even inspired (the sign-language version of ""The Rose"", the chicken farm scenes). It's also admirable that director Jared Hess (who co-wrote the movie with his wife Jerusha) goes neither the smutty nor the slasher route in drawing viewer attention. However, your enjoyment of this film will depend strictly on your ability to relate to a series of episodes that play out like one of those 1950's education films on how to behave on a prom date but reset to present-day, small-town Idaho. For me, the plights of the title character and his friends Pedro and Deb just aren't interesting enough to hold my attention. Accentuating the void is the fact that they are called upon to look very stilted and speak in deadpan, monotone voices. While amusing for about five minutes, it stretches an 86-minute movie into something that feels interminably longer.Jon Heder certainly looks the part of the supreme geek outsider with his red `fro, aviator glasses and polyester prom suit. But his character is simply not fleshed out enough to root for his success, as he avoids eye contact when he talks and encourages the abuse he gets from the more popular kids. As Napoleon's new best friend from Mexico, Efren Ramirez plays Pedro, who has no qualms about asking a popular girl out or running for class president. Former big-time child actress Tina Majorino (she was the little map-tattooed girl in ""Waterworld"") portrays Deb as a painfully shy girl who fancies herself as an Annie Liebowitz-type of photographer. They're all quirky enough, but you simply pay attention to these characters because no one else will. Usually someone like Napoleon would have a successful big brother to taunt him, but instead we have 32-year old Kip played with equal deadpan style by a pale-white Aaron Ruell. Kip spends most of his free time in online chat rooms and ultimately has a fanciful romance with his cyber-girlfriend, Lafawnduh. In fact, if you wait for the ending credits to finish, they even have a pastoral wedding. While the idea is funny, the ludicrous nature of the relationship feels overly contrived. Providing more honest laughs is Jon Gries as the moronic, self-proclaimed lady-killer Uncle Rico. With his 1980's-style toupee and constantly flexing his non-existent muscles, he lives in past gridiron glories that probably never happened, even buying a mail-order time machine to transport him back. His new career selling Tupperware makes for a couple of funny scenes.In fact, there are several amusing ideas, but they don't seem to add up to anything that memorable by the poignant tetherball-swinging end. One almost longs for the return of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Sixteen Candles"". Even the climax is oddly unfulfilling as Pedro's presidential aspirations hinge on Napoleon displaying some pretty impressive dance moves to a song by Jamiroquai. The DVD includes four deleted scenes and a black-and-white short called ""Peluca"", which stars Heder and provides the basis for the movie.

628310,A3H82LUT1EC655,B00005JNBQ,Erika Sorocco,"[8, 14]","In the state of Idaho, nothing exciting happens to teenager Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), except for the daily beatings he endures by his fellow classmates. Which, might I add, are totally uncalled for. After all, Napoleon has an awesome 'fro, cooler than cool moon boots, a pocketful of taters, and an array of skills that can't be beat. Yet Napoleon still has to endure days filled with avoiding his cage-fighter-wannabe brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), whom spends his days chatting online with hot babes; and his slimy, scheming Uncle Rico (Jon Gries). But when Napoleon meets a new kid named Pedro (Efren Ramirez), the only kid at school with a mustache; and then runs into shy, creative Deb (Tina Majorino), the three friends put together a plan to elect Pedro for class president. But to beat spoiled, stuck-up Summer (Haylie Duff), Napoleon will have to unleash his super-secret weapon. One that no one knows about.I will admit right now that I'm not often dragged into movies with such oddball characters as the one found in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. But there was something about the trailers that got me interested in this one. Luckily, I ended up enjoying this movie more than I could have ever imagined. Jon Heder is a fabulous actor, who is sure to make his mark as a comedian after his performance as Napoleon. His two strange friends, Tina Majorino (ANDRE and CORRINA, CORRINA) and Efren Ramirez (RACE and KAZAAM) couldn't be better as the two oddball sidekicks who show up whenever they are needed, to express strange comments about various situations. Haylie Duff's (IN SEARCH OF SANTA) performance was quite good as the at-times vicious, popular girl, Summer. While Napoleon's unfortunate family members, Aaron Ruell and Jon Gries (REAL GENIUS and JACKPOT) are absolutely hilarious. Ruell's performance as the annoying older brother is right on target; while Gries' role as the scheming Uncle stuck in 1982, couldn't be funnier. I rarely say this, but NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is sure to go down in cult-classic history, as are it's many quirky stars.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",5,Napoleon Dynamite Is Just That...Dynamite!,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,2119,"['state', 'Idaho', 'nothing', 'exciting', 'happens', 'teenager', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'daily', 'beatings', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'Which', 'might', 'add', 'are', 'totally', 'uncalled', 'Napoleon', 'awesome', ""'fro"", 'cooler', 'cool', 'moon', 'boots', 'pocketful', 'taters', 'array', 'skills', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'Napoleon', 'still', 'endure', 'days', 'filled', 'avoiding', 'cage-fighter-wannabe', 'brother', 'Kip', 'Aaron', 'Ruell', 'whom', 'days', 'chatting', 'online', 'hot', 'babes', 'slimy', 'scheming', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'when', 'Napoleon', 'new', 'kid', 'named', 'Pedro', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'only', 'kid', 'school', 'mustache', 'then', 'shy', 'creative', 'Deb', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'three', 'friends', 'put', 'together', 'plan', 'elect', 'Pedro', 'class', 'president', 'beat', 'spoiled', 'stuck-up', 'Summer', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'Napoleon', 'will', 'have', 'unleash', 'super-secret', 'weapon', 'One', 'one', 'about.I', 'will', 'admit', 'right', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'often', 'dragged', 'movies', 'such', 'oddball', 'characters', 'one', 'found', 'NAPOLEON', 'DYNAMITE', 'was', 'something', 'trailers', 'got', 'interested', 'one', 'Luckily', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'imagined', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'fabulous', 'actor', 'who', 'sure', 'make', 'mark', 'comedian', 'performance', 'Napoleon', 'two', 'strange', 'friends', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'ANDRE', 'CORRINA', 'CORRINA', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'RACE', 'KAZAAM', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'two', 'oddball', 'sidekicks', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'whenever', 'are', 'needed', 'express', 'strange', 'comments', 'various', 'situations', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'IN', 'SEARCH', 'OF', 'SANTA', 'performance', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'at-times', 'vicious', 'popular', 'girl', 'Summer', 'Napoleon', 'unfortunate', 'family', 'members', 'Aaron', 'Ruell', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'REAL', 'GENIUS', 'JACKPOT', 'are', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Ruell', 'performance', 'annoying', 'older', 'brother', 'right', 'target', 'Gries', 'role', 'scheming', 'Uncle', 'stuck', '1982', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'funnier', 'rarely', 'say', 'NAPOLEON', 'DYNAMITE', 'sure', 'go', 'down', 'cult-classic', 'history', 'are', 'many', 'quirky', 'stars.Erika', 'SoroccoBook', 'Review', 'Columnist', 'Community', 'Bugle', 'Newspaper']",Napoleon Dynamite

This movie was not a marvel of acting, and I wouldn't go so far as to call the characters loveable, but they were all very memorable. You'll probably just laugh and/or think they're stupid.Plot: 2.5 of 5 stars. No plot whatsoever. Just everyday escapades and quoteable lines in Napoleon Dynamite's life. It managed to keep my attention, though. I even asked ""Why are we interested in this?"" as we were watching, then continued being interested.Cinematography: 5 of 5 stars. The high rating is due to the excellent scenery/props/locations. The movie is set in a run-down, rural Idaho, and is complete with 70's shag carpets, ketchup stains, unmown lawns, and quiet flea-market type stores.Music: 4 of 5 stars. Perfect for the movie.

""So stupid it makes you laugh"", said one friend.Finally, I rented Napoleon Dynamite and sat down and saw a pretty nice little story about some simple lives in a place I'll never get to go. When I got back to my friends, I told them it was a cool little movie and that i really enjoyed it, but they had forgotten to tell me it is about autism and functioning with that disorder.Now I am locked in disagreement with my friends. They say Napoleon and Pedro are not playing autistic teens but are just dumb nerds. I say Napoleon, Pedro, and possibly others, are very autistic and the signs are right there in the audio and video.Napoleon is not really ""connected"" to people or the normal flow of life. He tries to communicate but cannot connect anything more complicated than a question and an answer. Napoleon has a fascination with rythmic movement (dance) and spinning rotations (tetherball) - that's autism. Napoleon sometimes experiences rushes of emotion that he has no idea how to process and it freezes his brain - key the scene when he first sees the suit of clothes in the thrift store.

628321,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B00005JNBQ,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[8, 10]","I had a bit of skepticism going into watching this film because of all the praise it had received. Usually those types of movies don't live up to the hype after all. It is true that there are two types of comedy: those that rely more on slapstick humor, and those that are more of a deadpan kind of humor. This movie definitely is the latter, and based on which kind you find more appealing may determine whether this movie is for you. However, as far as being in a class all its own, Napoleon Dynamite definitely deserves that distinction, as it is one of the more refreshing comedies to come out in a long time. It does not rely on nudity, profanity or potty jokes to get its laughs; rather, it uses the oddities of its characters and their unlikely situations.Napoleon Dynamite, which was made by MTV, is a movie that chronicles the high school life of one geeky teenager (Napoleon), and uses odd characters and situations to gain much of the humor Some notable characters are Pedro (the new kid at school that Napoleon befriends, who eventually decides to run for class president), Napoleon's 32 year old brother Kip (who lives at home with Napoleon and chats online to women) and Uncle Rico (Napoleon's sleazy and macho uncle, who apparently is still living in the 80s).  Napoleon is the kind of guy that some may classify as being odd, weird, eccentric, unusual or maybe a little of all of those. His mangy orange hair and monotone voice seem to add to his unusual personality.  Both at school and at home he tends to get himself into unusual circumstances and predicaments.This is one movie that really didn't need a plot, mainly because its strength is its characters and their ridiculous situations. For instance, there is a segment where Kip talks Napoleon into going to a self-defense program called Rex Kwan Do that is hilarious. Rex is a loud, aggressive, obnoxious body builder type who wears a bandana with stars on it, yellow glasses, a polo shirt with his name on it, and work out pants that are red, white and blue. After Kip volunteers to be the guinea pig while Rex demonstrates his methods on him, Rex exclaims boldly to the class of listeners, ""No more flying solo! You need someone watching your back at all times!"" There is also a funny scene where Pedro runs for class president and Napoleon, who had been practicing dancing, does a solo dance for the class after Pedro's speech.Uncle Rico's character really stole the show in many respects. After Napoleon's grandmother leaves town for a few days, Uncle Rico comes to watch over Napoleon and his brother. Rico is obsessed with the idea of going back to 1982 so he could relive a high school football game and make the critical pass in a game.  He eventually gets Kip to buy a time travel machine online, which, of course, doesn't work. He also invites Kip into a little business endeavor where they are selling items door to door. Eventually Napoleon becomes angry because Uncle Rico is pestering everyone around him, even the girl at school who likes Napoleon, with his business.Although the movie seems to be stuck in two different time periods, I thought the film was an original idea for a comedy. Far too often comedies have become formulaic and this is one movie that doesn't have a predictable mode to it. Normally these types of odd characters in a film only go so far (as we have seen with many of the Saturday Night Live skit based movies), but Napoleon Dynamite works well, and doesn't try too hard for laughs, which probably gives it more of an appeal. Overall I thought it was hilarious, and would recommend at least giving it a try.",5,Dynomite!,1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,3622,"['had', 'bit', 'skepticism', 'going', 'watching', 'film', 'praise', 'had', 'received', 'Usually', 'types', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'true', 'are', 'two', 'types', 'comedy', 'rely', 'more', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'are', 'more', 'deadpan', 'kind', 'humor', 'movie', 'definitely', 'latter', 'based', 'kind', 'find', 'more', 'appealing', 'may', 'determine', 'movie', 'However', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'class', 'own', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'definitely', 'distinction', 'one', 'more', 'refreshing', 'comedies', 'come', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'rely', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'potty', 'jokes', 'get', 'laughs', 'rather', 'oddities', 'characters', 'unlikely', 'situations.Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'was', 'made', 'MTV', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'one', 'geeky', 'teenager', 'Napoleon', 'odd', 'characters', 'situations', 'gain', 'much', 'humor', 'notable', 'characters', 'are', 'Pedro', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'Napoleon', 'befriends', 'who', 'eventually', 'run', 'class', 'president', 'Napoleon', '32', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'Kip', 'who', 'home', 'Napoleon', 'chats', 'online', 'women', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'Napoleon', 'sleazy', 'macho', 'uncle', 'who', 'apparently', 'still', 'living', '80s', 'Napoleon', 'kind', 'guy', 'may', 'classify', 'being', 'odd', 'weird', 'eccentric', 'unusual', 'maybe', 'little', 'mangy', 'orange', 'hair', 'monotone', 'voice', 'seem', 'add', 'unusual', 'personality', 'school', 'home', 'get', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'predicaments.This', 'one', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'plot', 'mainly', 'strength', 'characters', 'ridiculous', 'situations', 'instance', 'segment', 'where', 'Kip', 'Napoleon', 'going', 'self-defense', 'program', 'called', 'Rex', 'Kwan', 'Do', 'hilarious', 'Rex', 'loud', 'aggressive', 'obnoxious', 'body', 'builder', 'type', 'who', 'bandana', 'stars', 'yellow', 'glasses', 'polo', 'shirt', 'name', 'work', 'out', 'pants', 'are', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'Kip', 'volunteers', 'be', 'guinea', 'pig', 'Rex', 'methods', 'Rex', 'boldly', 'class', 'listeners', 'No', 'more', 'flying', 'solo', 'need', 'someone', 'watching', 'back', 'times', 'also', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Pedro', 'class', 'president', 'Napoleon', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'practicing', 'dancing', 'solo', 'dance', 'class', 'Pedro', 'speech.Uncle', 'Rico', 'character', 'really', 'stole', 'show', 'many', 'respects', 'Napoleon', 'grandmother', 'town', 'few', 'days', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'watch', 'Napoleon', 'brother', 'Rico', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'going', 'back', '1982', 'could', 'relive', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'game', 'make', 'critical', 'pass', 'game', 'eventually', 'Kip', 'buy', 'time', 'travel', 'machine', 'online', 'course', ""n't"", 'work', 'also', 'Kip', 'little', 'business', 'endeavor', 'where', 'are', 'selling', 'items', 'door', 'door', 'Eventually', 'Napoleon', 'angry', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'pestering', 'everyone', 'even', 'girl', 'school', 'who', 'Napoleon', 'movie', 'be', 'stuck', 'two', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'original', 'idea', 'comedy', 'Far', 'too', 'often', 'comedies', 'have', 'become', 'formulaic', 'one', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'predictable', 'mode', 'Normally', 'types', 'odd', 'characters', 'film', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'skit', 'based', 'movies', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'well', ""n't"", 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'laughs', 'probably', 'more', 'appeal', 'Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'would', 'recommend', 'least', 'giving', 'try']",Napoleon Dynamite

628324,AVEVNXZGYY2CE,B00005JNBQ,GadgetChick,"[1, 1]","I don't know what Roger Ebert's problem is. This is a great movie. I don't agree with his assessment that this film is depressing, and the only people who would laugh at Napoleon are people who feel superior to him. I laughed because I think anyone who wasn't part of the ""popular"" crowd in high school can relate to Napoleon's efforts to make a place for himself in his school and get a girl, regardless of how cluelessly he goes about it. Most people who were a little different from their peers as a teenager can relate to Napoleon, Pedro and Deb and their crusade against the shallow popular kids who look down on them. I had a friend in high school who ran for a student council position using a crazy gimmick - it didn't work for him, but this movie made me remember that and laugh. The movie is basically plotless but unbelievably funny. A lot of the humor is ""laugh at, not laugh with"" but does that make it a bad film? No.I think this compares a lot with ""The Big Lebowski"" (another incredibly funny movie) in that it's a picture about misfits and the lives they lead, and the ham-handed, screwball ways they go about accomplishing a goal. Just like Jeff Lebowski, Napoleon is unlikeable in a lot of ways, but the character is so earnest it's hard not to develop some kind of affection for him. I highly recommend that anyone - not just teenagers - see this movie. It's touching and funny in just the right way.(p.s. Most of the people who are giving this movie 1-star reviews are either functionally illiterate or they use lots of really large, complicated words in their reviews so they can sound as pompous and elitist as possible. That should tell you what kind of people don't like this movie. Always consider the source, people!

628325,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00005JNBQ,Galina,"[7, 19]","I did not know much about this independent comedy, until I saw it last weekend. I had heard that it was a surprise favorite at 2004 Sundance festival where it was met with non-stop laughing. Since I admire off-beat humor and am a big fan of a good comedy, I was ready to love or at least like ""Napoleon Dynamite"". I was sorely disappointed. The best and the funniest thing about ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (2004) is its title. By the title alone I expected the movie and its main character to be charismatic and brave as Napoleon I and explosive as dynamite or at least, unpredictable, fresh, and original. Guess what, it is none of the above. First and foremost, the movie is so boring, slow, and non-interesting that I could hardly manage to sit through it. Yes, I've read the comments that Napoleon, and his two equally sleep-walking friends, Pedro, the most impossible candidate for school president and Deb, the girl we should believe Napoleon might have a crush on  and few more high school clich&eacute; characters are exactly like the regular students in a regular high school. Even if it is true and I hope that it is not always the case, I don't have to sympathize with the trio of walking zombies. ND and his friends are so bored and boring that their boredom becomes contagious - for me it was. I did not find anyone on the screen slightly interesting, leave alone sympathetic. Well, there was one exception, Napoleon's and his older brother Kip's, 32 years old Internet chat rooms addict's  grandmother who was injured in a dune buggy accident (that sounded interesting or at least promising) and taken from the screen after the first fifteen minutes. She was lucky - she did not have to endure the presence of her complete idiot-nephew Rico, the ex-jock of the 1982, a door-to-door salesman, whose adventures or projects did not contribute a single funny scene or even a joke to this sophomoric excuse for a movie.While trying not to fall asleep, I was thinking of the others, more successful and much better first movies that might have been the inspiration for ND. Wes Anderson's debut, ""Bottle Rocket"" (1996) even if not a masterpiece is often hilarious and always original. Todd Solondz's first feature which explores the similar subject, ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" (1995) is a terrific film - brave, and passionate - real dynamite.

It also was extremely creative and when the credits roll you just wish it were not over, and guess what, it is not.

628330,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B00005JNBQ,General Breadbasket,"[1, 2]","""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a film by Jared Hess and stars Jon Heder. It's an independent film, more or less, featuring quirky characters, but unlike so many other independent films in this vein, it's not depressing or malicious. It's a lighthearted comedy with heart and personality, and a very quotable one at that. I don't remember it coming out in theatres here in Australia (I first heard about it here on amazon), but it has gone on to be a big hit on DVD. I've even seen a ""Vote For Pedro"" t-shirt or two being worn up in the city.Napoleon Dynamite lives in an American country town. He loves to draw mythical beasts, dreams of numchucks and bo skills, plays tetherball, feeds his aunt's llama every day and doesn't have many friends. After going to a self defense course with his brother Kip, he is told that he has to have someone to watch his back. Fortunately, there's a new kid at school, a Mexican immigrant called Pedro. There's also Deb, a girl who left a whole box of merchandise she was selling on his doorstep for college money. The school dance is coming up, so is the school election, and Napoleon's uncle Rico is in town, a man who is stuck in 1982, in his glory days as a footballer. Also on the calendar is a meeting between Kip and La Fawnduh, his internet girlfriend. Do Napoleon, his family and friends have the skills to get through the year?The film has a tacky, domestic kind of setting, and in that way it reminds me a bit of the Australian TV series ""Kath and Kim"", though that show doesn't feel quite as detatched and awkward as this film does. It's a good detatched and awkward though, it goes with and adds to the characters I think. They're all a bit out of the ordinary, but there's a kind of sense to what they're doing. Some of the fun I had watching this was trying to figure out what the characters were thinking and how they really felt about each other (Napoleon and Deb's friendship, for instance). Being set in Jared Hess' home town helped a bit, I think. He would have known where to go, what backdrops he wanted against the plot.I could relate to a few of the characters in this film. I don't know anyone exactly like Napoleon, but I know a few people who have a few ""Napoleon"" elements. I know back in high school I used to draw pictures of weird creatures, and of girls in my class (though I never sent pictures to the girls like Napoleon did). I knew people who were way into the self-defense stuff, and one or two people who have Napoleon's way of replying. Maybe there's a bit of Napoleon (or Kip or Deb or Pedro) in a lot of people.Special features on the regular edition include a making of the after-credits scene, and an audio commentary with Jared Hess and Jon Heder, recalling anecdotes and influences for the film. A lot of it is actually from Jared's life, it seems.Definitely worth a look if you're interested.",5,A Dynamite Film (With Skills),1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,2865,"['Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'film', 'Jared', 'Hess', 'stars', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'independent', 'film', 'more', 'less', 'featuring', 'quirky', 'characters', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'independent', 'films', 'vein', 'not', 'depressing', 'malicious', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'heart', 'personality', 'very', 'quotable', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'coming', 'out', 'theatres', 'here', 'Australia', 'first', 'heard', 'here', 'amazon', 'gone', 'be', 'big', 'hit', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'even', 'seen', 'Vote', 'Pedro', 't-shirt', 'two', 'being', 'worn', 'up', 'city.Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'American', 'country', 'town', 'draw', 'mythical', 'beasts', 'dreams', 'numchucks', 'bo', 'skills', 'plays', 'tetherball', 'aunt', 'llama', 'day', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'friends', 'going', 'self', 'defense', 'course', 'brother', 'Kip', 'told', 'have', 'someone', 'watch', 'back', 'Fortunately', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'Mexican', 'immigrant', 'called', 'Pedro', 'also', 'Deb', 'girl', 'who', 'left', 'whole', 'box', 'merchandise', 'was', 'selling', 'doorstep', 'college', 'money', 'school', 'dance', 'coming', 'up', 'so', 'school', 'election', 'Napoleon', 'uncle', 'Rico', 'town', 'man', 'who', 'stuck', '1982', 'glory', 'days', 'footballer', 'Also', 'calendar', 'meeting', 'Kip', 'La', 'Fawnduh', 'internet', 'girlfriend', 'Do', 'Napoleon', 'family', 'friends', 'have', 'skills', 'get', 'year', 'film', 'tacky', 'domestic', 'kind', 'setting', 'way', 'bit', 'Australian', 'TV', 'series', 'Kath', 'Kim', 'show', ""n't"", 'feel', 'quite', 'detatched', 'awkward', 'film', 'good', 'detatched', 'awkward', 'characters', 'think', ""'re"", 'bit', 'ordinary', 'kind', 'sense', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'fun', 'had', 'watching', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'thinking', 'how', 'really', 'felt', 'other', 'Napoleon', 'Deb', 'friendship', 'instance', 'Being', 'set', 'Jared', 'Hess', 'home', 'town', 'helped', 'bit', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'where', 'go', 'what', 'wanted', 'plot.I', 'could', 'relate', 'few', 'characters', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'exactly', 'Napoleon', 'know', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'few', 'Napoleon', 'elements', 'know', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'used', 'draw', 'pictures', 'weird', 'creatures', 'girls', 'class', 'never', 'sent', 'pictures', 'girls', 'Napoleon', 'did', 'knew', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'way', 'self-defense', 'stuff', 'one', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'Napoleon', 'way', 'replying', 'Maybe', 'bit', 'Napoleon', 'Kip', 'Deb', 'Pedro', 'lot', 'people.Special', 'features', 'regular', 'edition', 'include', 'making', 'after-credits', 'scene', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Jared', 'Hess', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'recalling', 'anecdotes', 'influences', 'film', 'lot', 'actually', 'Jared', 'life', 'seems.Definitely', 'look', ""'re"", 'interested']",Napoleon Dynamite

628336,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00005JNBQ,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[4, 4]","This is a small film, a very good one, told large. The director, Jared Hess, is a 24 year old wunderkind from the barrens of Preston, Idaho, and he has created a gem; a cousin to the Coens. This is a comedy that will sneak up on you, the stuff of belly laughs. Last year he did a 9-minute short film, PELUCA, starring Jon Heder, and it seems to have been the outline for this feature film. Hess is from Preston, and he filmed it as only a resident could; full of empty landscapes, lonely roads, farmers, ranchers, and rednecks. A scene where Napoleon gets a job for the day on a chicken ranch is worth the price of admission.There have been numerous comparisons for this movie to WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, and RUSHMORE. But for me this film stands firmly on its own. It plays out like an absurdist straight drama that also happens to be funny. It is reminiscent of some of the best moments in the Coen Brother's RAISING ARIZONA.The film was a big hit at Sundance, and it has been distributed well; a lucky break for Hess. Wouldn't it be wonderful if more of the youth of our country could rally behind this tiny epic, and create it as a cult film; that for a moment they step away from the commedia del raunchy that they mostly immerse themselves in; that they actually laugh at themselves, the way they really are, just kids struggling to grow up? The 13-30 year old demographic dictates our art, our music, and our movies. This little film could go a long ways in restoring the missing heart, the naivete and grace to the comedic genre.One real plus for me was the odd wholesomeness of this movie. There was zero profanity. Most of the time when a script deletes realistic high school vernacular, and changes the language to a lot of goshs, dangs, hecks, frigging, and freaking, it usually morphs quickly into the landscape of the lame. But somehow, Hess makes the lack of profanity work, and we don't miss it.Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Jon Heder,"" geek deadpan perfection."" He loved the film, and directs us,"" to laugh until it hurts."" Heder is a lanky beanpole with a red Afro, all Adam's apple and oversized glasses, and overbite. At first glance one sees a young Yahoo Serious, or a Scott ""Carrot Top"" Thompson. But no, Heder is more natural, more believable, more absurd, and wonderfully unselfconscious. He is less the over-the-top screamer. In his best moments, like when he played tetherball with himself, or practiced his killer dance moves in his room, he reminded me of some of the great clowns; like a young Jerry Lewis, and even the precursory shadings of the great ones like Jackie Gleason in GIGOT, or Jacques Tati. Heder is Napoleon Dynamite, a prince of Preston, a nerdish Conan out to slay demons, or maybe just to get laid.The setting for the film seems to be the early 1990's. Napoleon, and his older brother, Kip, live with their grandmother, played by Sandy Martin, who does a great turn as a biker grandma, who still dates, eats entirely too much steak, and loves her llama. Aaron Ruell, as the brother Kip, a 32 year old who has been a nerd for so long he is oblivious to it, does a fine job with the role. He lives in front of his computer, logging countless hours in chat rooms, searching for cyber-love, running up huge internet bills. Tina Mjorino, as girlfriend Deb, was wonderfully wacky, off-center, and loveable. A former child star, from films like WATERWORLD, she is 19 years old now, and she is good enough to be slugging it out with the likes of Thora Birch, Jena Malone, and Christina Ricci for those Odd Girl parts. She found the sweet quirkiness and heartfelt honesty of her character. Jon Gries, an actor since 1968, son of famed film director Tom Gries, was very good as the arrogant deluded ignorant Uncle Ricco; a man stuck in the past, reliving a fake fantasy that when he played high school football he might have been a great star, even turned pro...if his stupid coach had not left him on the bench so much. Efrem Ramirez, as Napoleon's best friend, Pedro, is a veteran actor from 10 films. His baby face, and deadpan delivery served him well. He did an excellent job. When he decided to run for class president, against a popular cheerleader, the tempo begins to shift, and we begin to see that this sad and funny drama was going to bend into a kind of fantasy tale; with underdogs rising to the occasion, taking on overwhelming odds, and of course, emerging victorious.In smaller roles we first find Diedrich Baker as the karate teacher Rex, and he is the most seasoned veteran of the cast, having appeared in 33 films. He had a lot of fun with this part, prancing around in his American flag ""bad-boy"" pants, and pushing around the local kids while taking their money. Then there is Shondrella Avery appearing as Kip's cyberlove La Fawnduh. She is one hot mama, and she seems to like short skinny white dudes. When Kip boards the bus with her, bandana on his head, glasses in his pocket, suitcases in his hands, leaving home for the first time, we realize the film has come full circle, and now is a fairy tale.I had approached this film skeptically not being sure how I would react or relate to it...but it won me over. It was not just another dumb comedy that would disintegrate two points off my intelligence quotient just by sitting through it. Rather, it was a fine little film, large on ambition, that I came to care about. I recommend it highly.",4,The Prince of Preston,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,5415,"['small', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'told', 'large', 'director', 'Jared', 'Hess', '24', 'year', 'old',

His clothing is unique, perhaps, but there are tons of adolescent guys who draw fantasy creatures, sulk, never appear to pay attention, act awkwardly with girls, and/or never quite clue into the intricacies of social interaction.For those viewers who enjoy plot-driven action movies: this is not the film for you.  It essentially has no plot and is, rather, a series of vignettes and sight gags about a high school boy whose small-town life in Idaho is both mundane and bizarrly embarrassing.  As the commentary states, most of these vignettes are based on people and things that actually happened to the actors/writers/directors, as hard as that is to believe (i.e., the time machine bit).Napoleon Dynamite is filmed almost in documentary style, which lends a certain wry, understated quality to the many, many sight gags the viewer is treated to.  The movie parodies the absurdity of people and life, but much more intelligently than most other comedies.  This is not Dumb and Dumber.While watching this movie, I continually asked my husband, ""What the heck is this about?""  Napoleon Dynamite is original filmmaking and rather difficult to describe or even, sometimes, comprehend.  But it is funny and it is well done.

Some loved, some hated it. But, most of the people I knew seemed to enjoy it. So, when I was over at a friend's house and saw a copy of it, I decided to watch it. He had really enjoyed it and I...Well, first off, let me say that Jon Heder did a great job as Napoleon. I mean, this was the biggest nerd in the world. With his red hair, big glasses, big boots and stupid remarks.He's Napoleon, a nerd in Idaho who lives with his crazy grandma, old and pathethic brother and then his insane oncle Rico. Napoleon gets bullied around, isn't popular at all and only has 2 friends: Deb and Pedro. They are both also neat characters. The movie is often very interesting to watch and really fun. At other times, it seems really stupid and pointless. But, in the end, it was great fun and quite funny actually. Napoleon delivers laughs but I thought that ucle Rico was by far the funniest. He delivered loads of laughs. He is a pathethic man obssessed with eating steaks who thinks that he is the best football player in the world. Even though he isn't at all. Pedro is also very funny as are his mean and tough cousins. The movie has some quite hilarious moments that you'll remember forever. From uncle Rico's behavior, to Napoleon's boots and glasses, to everything else. It's just great. Also, Napoleon's brother is quite funny as is his girlfriend La Phonda. It's a really hilarious movie and I don't want to give away any of the jokes so that you can discover them on your own.

If you're not from Idaho or Utah, half the jokes probably won't even make sense.  I guess there's a certain sort of charm that the movie has, but I know that if I wasn't familiar with the Idaho/Utah/Mormon culture, I would think the movie is even dumber than it really is.  The first time I saw Napoleon Dynamite in the theaters, I didn't really like it.  Then I got the DVD as a gift, and enjoyed it much more the second time.  I guess I didn't have any expectations the second time, and the characters take a little time to get used to.  The DVD commentary fetaures the director and others talking about the movie.  Watch it and you'll see just how weird we Idaho/Utah folks are.  The movie is instantly quotable, and proves that a money-making movie can be made without profanity or sex.  The DVD is worth buying, because there's a short, independent film called Peluca on it that Napoleon Dynamite was based on.  The short film is hilarious, more funny than almost anything in the actual movie.  The short is pretty stupid too, but you can't help but laugh.  I still don't understand how this movie got so big.  It's unique and funny, but it's far from being a masterpiece of filmmaking.",4,Gosh!

""Funnier than Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" And I thought, wow, if it's funnier than Monty Python, it is a must see.

I, however, did not.Now, often, when I told my friends that I really didn't like the movie Napolean Dynamite, they were in shock. They'd ask why? Hmm...Well in all honesty, I don't know.

628350,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B00005JNBQ,Ian,"[1, 1]","When my sister rented Napoleon Dynamite at Blockbuster the other night, I didint expect much out of the movie, seeing as the title charachter looked really strange, and the adds that were run during the theatrical release didint help to win me over.  After watching the movie, I admit that it was a plesant little suprise that had me chuckling a lot during my initial viewing.If you want me to tell you what the plot is, I really won't get anywhere, because the movie has no real plot.  It's just a glimpse at the life of a high school nerd as he goes through a roughtly a month of his life.  As the movie moves from scene to scene, you never really know what to expect.  There's everything from a speech about japanese scientists trying to kill the loch ness monster, to time machines that need crystals to work.  The whole thing is so bizzare that it defies explenation.In an age where movies routinely have guns and huge explosions, Napoleon Dynamite has none of those things.  There's no special effects at work, there are no CGI elements, nothing.  The movie relies on it's charachters, and all of them turn in stellar performances.  Jon Heder is PERFECT as Napoleon.  With his monstorous 70's style glasses and ever open mouth, he's perfect as your steryotype nerd.  I love how his expression never changes during the movie.  I got the feeling that if he saw a nuclear explosion, he'd still have that bored look on his face.  It's a delight watching him.  The supporting cast is equally good, such as Napoleons dweeb thirty-fivish brother, his 80's obsessed uncle and the lovable Pedro.Other little things stand out here.  The music is both odd and disturbingly catchy.  The scenery of gorgeous Idaho is, well...gorgeous!  I love how Napoleon's house is retro 70's style, which matches his personality perfectly.  And a special nod must go to the dialoge, which has some of the funniest bits i've heard in years.  My favorite?  A certian scene with tupperware, ""Dangit!""In conclusion, I find Napoleon Dynamite to be an interesting movie that is really quirky and has a lot of charm.

628351,A2B0XO8BTPRX7R,B00005JNBQ,Ian Vance,"[5, 30]","It's fairly safe to say, this far into the 21st century, that the decade of '00' seriously lacks a cultural identity/movement of its own, at least in contrast to the past five decades: the war years of the 40's, the isolationist Americana of the 50's, the Aquarius Ideals of the 60's, the decadence and disco-tinge of the 70's, the Me-Decade excess of the 80's, the angst and 'alternative' option of the 90's.  Thus, over the past couple years, an increasingly wistful, decidedly kitsche assimilation of the styles and media-motifs of the immediate-past has crept into the mass-consciousness, especially for those of the '00' youth, inexperienced and adrift on the ripple-shock tides of a simultaneous informational over-abundance and widespread social repression/reactionary meme in the wake of 9-11.  The ridiculous visual hubris and innocuous ignorance that seem intimately tied to the 70's and the 80's have become attractive to those seeking career revitalization (Gwen Stefani and Outkast being prominent recent examples) and for those wishing to ape a personal neo-retro style that, in equal measure quirky and twee, turns back from the sterile fashions of futurism, the devastating deconstruction of knowing too much, too soon (or, perhaps more truthfully, knowing too much and not nearly enough).  To wit: so chaotic and complex is our contemporary social animal, that retreating into golden-hued nostalgia, as propagated by VH1, is incredibly seductive to the scions of the Post-Cold War Information Era, a womb of unrepentant confidence and social ideal so sorely lacking in these trying times.  You know, back when our plutocratic-puppet president was actually a ~good actor~; back when men teased their hair with aplomb and were considered the macho quintessence; back when the cultural identity was safe, with easy pickings for either path of conformity or rebellion.  ""Things were better back then"" - which is all nonsense, of course, like most nostalgic reflection: despite the more fantastical Hollywood archive of the 70's and 80's, that era was plagued with just as much uncertainty and threatening factors as we are now: AIDS, Nuclear Holocaust, economic depression/inflation, Iran-Contra, corporation corruption and drug-addled inner city denizens...  The Grass is always Greener two decades past.Thus the timely release of *Napoleon Dynamite*, a movie that capitalizes on this retreat into the past, reveling in unabashed kitsche and resurrecting the hoary Revenge of the Nerd archetype within a firmly-80's teen-comedy structure.  The look of the film is carefully, meticulously crafted: fashion from the late 70's, video cassette players from the early 80's, the fake-organic interior decoration made popular in the 60's; complete with knick-knacks and kitsche of any era, including plastic green toy-soldiers and the random thrift-store sai.  Yet late-90's elements insinuate themselves into the film, defying our attempt to define it to this or that era: chat-rooms and the music of Jamiroquai and the Backstreet Boys inform the audience that the environment of *Napoleon Dynamite* is actually that of a time-warp Idaho local, past and present intrinsically woven via cultural artifacts, verbal expressions and the overall ambience of the film total, much like Wes Anderson's uber-quirky exegesis *The Royal Tenembaums*.  Past and the just-past merge; the threatening cloud of the future is utterly banished in this ugly-duckling fairy tale.  In this regard, I find *Napoleon Dynamite* to be a brilliant example of our retro-seduction, a borderline-exploitative wish fulfillment juggernaught with the ability to tempt the kitsche-craving of any age or temperament.And yet, as a film, I found Napoleon Dynamite sadly lacking, ineffectual as entertainment and about as deep as anything else stamped with the MTV seal of production, a somewhat boring affair that only incidentally rises above its trend-conglomeration ethic to produce a surprised chuckle.  Obviously I'm in the minority here, given the glowing reviews both on this page and from most mainstream critics; to give further example, this film was recommended to me from a high-school work associate who claimed he'd watched it four times in just two days.  It touched him, quite deeply, for reasons I suspect are congruent with my beginning-paragraph thesis.  I, however, struggled with this movie.  Napoleon himself is an unsympathetic caricature of the everyman geek; the fact that he so obviously ""lacks skills"" means that almost all comedic triggers associated with his actions and attitudes are a matter of laughing ~at~, rather than laughing ~with~.  Even worse, Pedro is the ultimate construction of a stereotype, tiptoeing around offensiveness.  Why does he want to be class president? Even Pedro doesn't know.  More interesting are Napoleon's brother, the grandmamma's boy seeking soul-mate status, and his uncle, a football-jock relic lost in the glory-days of `82.  Nearly all of those surprised chuckles I mentioned before stemmed from these two characters, but even they are not enough to sustain the movie as a whole.Now, it may seem that I'm being overtly harsh with this film, but I couldn't escape the notion that a good deal of *Napoleon Dynamite* was crippled by artistic laziness, an inescapable developmental ~complacency~ in regard to the core material.  Again and again, moments of potential humor lose substance; doubtless profound connotations are laid waste by the need to be clever.  This could have been a five-star classic, instead of the naval-gazing faux-indie anticlimax it ends up being.  Alas.I rate this movie three stars for its (un?) conscious attempt to epitomize the facile neo-retro trend that has so-far dominated '00'; its occasional moments of earned levity and undeniable clever faade; and for that final dance-sequence...dat boy has got some moovez, yo!",3,"Brilliant Kitsche Amalgamation, Swaddled in Complacency",1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,5884,"['fairly', 'safe', 'say',

The first time I saw it was a couple months ago in the theatres with a couple guys. We were at the mall and didnt know what to do, so we went to this movie called Napolean Dynamite because another guy recomended it. And let me tell you, I couldn't thank this guy enough. This is easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I've seen it like 7x on dvd because we rented it. Its just a story about a couple nomral people living their boring lives. My favorite scene from the movie isn't funny, but very deep. The shot when the three of the main characters (Napolean, Perdo, and Deb) standing at the side of the dance, (shot from behind them) watching everyone else have fun and watching the world go by. But I have to say the best thing about this movie was that it was made by just normal guys. Listen to the commentary, its just three normal guys sitting around laughing about the movie and their experience making it. Its not some director saying &quot;Now the symbol in this scene is that the fire is above the ice, meaning that Joe's battle with himself...&quot;But anyway, I'm rambling again.

628358,ANYDF6GKK7PA4,B00005JNBQ,"Jackson Zhou ""The Craftsman""","[2, 2]","I have to admit that when I first saw the trailer for this film. I didn't know what to make of it. It looked like it was supposed to be a comedy, but the trailer, which was supposed to be a condensed and ""best of"" version of a movie (in this case the funniest moments of ""Napoleon Dynamite""), wasn't really that funny at all, at least not immediately and apparently. I was still intrigued, nonetheless. And finally curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a look at home, and I must say while I don't remember falling out of my seat from laughing at any point during the movie, it did bring a almost perpetual smile to my face with its sense of subtle and dry-witted humor. And it carried a feel good message throughout too.The film brings the trials and tribulations of high school adolescence to a level of quirkiness that is unseen in any other films that I've seen in this genre. Most of the film's delightfully eccentric humor can be attributed to its colorful cast of weirdoes: The main character Napoleon Dynamite who's friendless and painfully un-self-conscious about his nerdiness; His brother Kip, who's a 32 year old live-at-home self-professed lady's man; A self delusional uncle Rico, who peddles herbal breast size enhancement to the local women, and dreams of traveling back in time to the glory year of 1982, when he was the football star of his high school; just to name a few. One would also be exposed to the life of rural Idaho, where the next house is always a mile away, and where Napoleon earns a 6-dollars a day salary with the chicken farmers. The movie is funny because none of the characters are aware of their flaws and awkwardness, but somehow in the end good things happen to those who happen to be doing nothing but just being their weird little selves.While some may argue that there's no character development in this movie, I disagree. Napoleon for one clearly goes through a transformation during the film. He is a nerd and a conceited loser in the beginning, throwing around petty lies like claiming the girl in a promotional glamour shot is his girlfriend. But eventually he learns to be truthful to others, and most importantly to himself, by building meaningful friendships with those who can identify with him, and through unabashed self-expression.The moral message of self-expression is central to this movie and very admirable.  But ultimately I liked this film due the superb and genuine performance of its cast. The portrayals of the characters are very dead-on and that's a big part in what makes this movie funny and watchable.",4,Delightfully Eccentric,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,2589,"['have', 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'looked', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'trailer', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'condensed', 'best', 'version', 'movie', 'case', 'funniest', 'moments', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'funny', 'least', 'not', 'immediately', 'apparently', 'was', 'still', 'intrigued', 'nonetheless', 'finally', 'curiosity', 'got', 'better', 'decided', 'give', 'look', 'home', 'must', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'falling', 'seat', 'laughing', 'point', 'movie', 'did', 'bring', 'almost', 'perpetual', 'smile', 'face', 'sense', 'subtle', 'dry-witted', 'humor', 'carried', 'feel', 'good', 'message', 'too.The', 'film', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'high', 'school', 'adolescence', 'level', 'quirkiness', 'unseen', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'genre', 'Most', 'film', 'delightfully', 'eccentric', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'colorful', 'cast', 'weirdoes', 'main', 'character', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'who', 'friendless', 'painfully', 'un-self-conscious', 'nerdiness', 'brother', 'Kip', 'who', '32', 'year', 'old', 'live-at-home', 'self-professed', 'lady', 'man', 'self', 'delusional', 'uncle', 'Rico', 'who', 'herbal', 'breast', 'size', 'enhancement', 'local', 'women', 'dreams', 'traveling', 'back', 'time', 'glory', 'year', '1982', 'when', 'was', 'football', 'star', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'One', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'exposed', 'life', 'rural', 'Idaho', 'where', 'next', 'house', 'always', 'mile', 'away', 'where', 'Napoleon', '6-dollars', 'day', 'salary', 'chicken', 'farmers', 'movie', 'funny', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'aware', 'flaws', 'awkwardness', 'somehow', 'end', 'good', 'things', 'happen', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'doing', 'nothing', 'just', 'being', 'weird', 'little', 'selves.While', 'may', 'argue', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'disagree', 'Napoleon', 'one', 'clearly', 'transformation', 'film', 'nerd', 'conceited', 'loser', 'beginning', 'throwing', 'around', 'petty', 'lies', 'claiming', 'girl', 'promotional', 'glamour', 'shot', 'girlfriend', 'eventually', 'be', 'truthful', 'others', 'most', 'importantly', 'building', 'meaningful', 'friendships', 'who', 'can', 'identify', 'unabashed', 'self-expression.The', 'moral', 'message', 'self-expression', 'central', 'movie', 'very', 'admirable', 'ultimately', 'liked', 'film', 'due', 'superb', 'genuine', 'performance', 'cast', 'portrayals', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'dead-on', 'big', 'part', 'what', 'movie', 'funny', 'watchable']",Napoleon Dynamite

I am a huge fan of indie films and find them much more entertaining than the big blockbuster dramas and crappy comedies with juvenile humour in them, but this one just plain--excuse the blunt word--sucked. The main character will make you want to kill him in the most gruesome of ways because he is not only a complete and utter loser, but he is also a complete jerk who is negative all the time. It was truly painful to watch this film because I was getting depressed at how stupid this character could be.

Now I consider myself something of a stupid-humor connoisseur, laughing (and laughing frequently no less) at movies like BASEketball, Dumb and Dumber, Scary Movie, There's Something About Mary, etc.  However, the difference between those movies and Napoleon Dynamite is that those movies make attempts at a plot, or at least a clothesline to hang jokes on, and they set up their jokes.  In most comedies there is a set-up and a punchline, and the audience laughs.  In Napoleon Dynamite, there's only stupidity, and the audience is expected to laugh regardless.It would be one thing if the movie at least bounced all over the place, so that even if a viewer like myself found some parts of it dry then at least there would be other sprinklings of humor to choose from.  Unfortunately, the movie also finds repetition funny.  Napoleon saying ""Gosh!"" ad nauseum or his uncle repeating over and over that ""if Coach would have put me 4th quarter we'd'a been state champions for sure"" is not humor.  At least the uncle gets credit for being remotely animated, as most of the characters- Napoleon, his brother, Pedro, and Deb speak in monotones for almost all of the movie.  Again, this is apparently funny.Unless you like 90 minutes of stupid sketch comedy (with no plot that's is exactly what the movie feels like) then avoid this film.

This film is definitely a sleeper, you will need to watch it multiple times to truly appreciate it. Jon Heder does a bang-up job as Napoleon Dynamite, a not so typical nerd. Napoleon lives with his brother and grandmother who is injured early on in the film during a ATV accident. Enter Uncle Rico who comes to look after the boys during his grandmothers absence. Uncle Rico is stuck in the year 1982 his football glory years and cannot get past the fact that he was on the bench during the State Championship. He's pretty much Matt Foley in other words he lives in a van down by the river. Napoleon and Uncle Rico clash from the get go to hilarious results. There are some side-splitting scenes including the time machine bit, throwing the button and Napoleon's lament over not having any skills that girls would find attractive (""I don't have any good skills...you know like nunchuck skills""). When a new student, Pedro Sanchez, enters the school, Napoleon befriends him and the rest is history. Not much happens during the running time of Napoleon Dynamite but ultimately I could not keep my eyes off it. Heder does such a fantastic job as the main character that we are left wanting to know more about him. The dance sketch following Pedro's speech was no less inspirational than Rocky taking Apollo Creed to the brink in the original. Napoleon Dynamite celebrates diversity and leaves the viewer with a great almost simplistic message...it's not what you look like on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside that counts.

Destined to become a classic, ND's lines, characters and scenes are already being burned into memory by fans - a ""buyer"" (not a ""renter"") if ever there was one.The film assembles a cast of the weirdest, most engaging characters seen on screen in many a day. ND follows the crazy/ordinary life of Napoleon Dynamite, high school giga-nerd, his scrawny older brother Kip, 1982-obsessed Uncle Rico, uptight girlfriend Deb, dim-bulb-yet-ambitious Pedro and a host of other misfit types who should be familiar to anyone who has endured the American school scene. Set in rural Idaho, there's no particular plot other than getting through the school day, fending off jocks and beauty queens, trying to get a tetherball partner and attempting sweet jumps on bikes. Along the way, the film provided dead-on satires of martial arts commercials, school elections, wild grandmas, glamour photography and the inanities of life itself.Napoleon (Jonn Heder) is a frizzy-haired, bespectacled beanpole who is unpopular but doesn't care. He spends his school day drawing magical animals, yearning for a ""skill"" and ludicrously lying about his dangerousness to others who know better. Heder perfectly captures the type: prickly toward all those who threaten or annoy him (including grade-schoolers), never making eye-contact, mouth always agape, unathletic and uncoordinated. His unironic delivery of exclamations like ""Idiot!"" and ""Whatever I want! Gosh!"" and ""Lucky!"" (this delivered when an unlikely character lands an outlandishly sexy ""soulmate"") are quickly becoming classic.

Last night, I had the pleasure of seeing what I consider one of the funniest and most interesting film I've seen in awhile.Dynamite is one weird kid. He has the most eccentric, odd, loser family in Idaho and he dons odd clothing, hairstyles, and participates in random, mundane activities. But, that's what makes him interesting, what makes the film interesting. As we follow him, from his ventures with his brother into joining a karate, defense class labeled, 'Rex Kwan Do', to a day of school where the kids are just as dated as he is, we meet and see more of the dynamic world.Imagine a world today, that wasn't in today's standards and culture. A place where the music is of the 80's and the people are stuck in the fashion and lifestyles of the 70's. Odd doesn't describe this, but hilariously distinguished might. It's not that funny that you sit there and laugh out loud or kick the chair hysterically; it's just there, and laugh if you may. Although there are scenarios everyone is bound to laugh, but for the most part, its open minded humor.See the film.  I had approached this film skeptically, not being sure how I would react or relate to it...but it won me over.

Keep in mind that I'm someone who would kill to star in a Paul Thomas Anderson movie and count Empire of the Sun and Magnolia as two of my favorite ever movies, right alongside The Shawshank Redemption.  I also have six DVD's of the best of Beavis and Butthead also and the Collector's Edition of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, so you can't say that I don't appreciate dead-pan comedy.  But those works still have some art and love in them and perfect delivery combined with actual PLOTS and PUNCHLINES.  This movie was just plain dry almost all the way through.  The one-liners were lame and monotonous.  There was no plot or point to this whole movie.  You can see that I need to appreciate on a subtle level, which there was none of.

I didn't want to know if I was the kind of person who likes Napoleon Dynamite.When this film debuted, some of my closest friends told me it was an amazing film, hilarious, and even quite possibly the best movie ever. These are good friends, whose opinions I trust. They have recommended good movies to me before, and I have been content and enthralled with their suggestions.However, there was a contingent group who hated it. These are good friends, whose opinions I trust. They have recommended good movies to me before, and I have been content and enthralled with their suggestions.

Complete strangers I harassed on the bus said this. Just kidding, I don't ride the bus. But complete strangers did come to the same conclusions about this film.Napoleon Dynamite is either the best or the worst film ever made.Suddenly, the world is thrown into sharp contrast. There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who love it and those who hate it. I didn't want to know what kind of person I was, if I was a lover or a hater. What would it say about who I am and the structure of my personality and my taste in films and comedy? Which ever would I be? Let the spinning of the Tao commence!I've now seen it three times. Upon the first viewing, I kept waiting for the punch line. I kept waiting to laugh. It felt like it was a constant set-up with no payoff. (However, the introductory credits were clever and exciting.) It left me feeling blah.Upon the second viewing, for some reason, I started to giggle more. I paid more attention to the details. I submitted myself to that world. Napoleon's whiny GHAWD seemed less grating. Pedro was suddenly hilarious. And damn, I want that suit.By the third viewing, I think I figured it out. It's not a constant set up and no punch lines. It's all punch line. That's why it's one of the most quoted movies right now. Every phrase is a one-liner with a subtle punch. I bet the French love that movie. The background, the sets and clothes, the top-loading VCRs, the god-almighty moon boots, the ambiance is the set up for this film. At first I balked over the seeming lack of plot, but the more I've seen it, the less it matters. The wedding is the best part. ""Sorry I'm late. I just got done taming a wild honeymoon stallion for you guys."" Salvador Dali would be proud.So, what can I say, I liked it. Eventually. It grew on me like an overzealous mole. Like a chia pet. Like bacteria on a forming brick of bleu cheese. The only problem now is that I have a nine-year-old running around occasionally belting out an exasperated whine of, ""I told you!

628383,A1IBSQQHGCDUAN,B00005JNBQ,"Jeremy Ulrey ""Bangyrmfhead""","[0, 1]","Christ, it's hard to spell out what makes ""Napolean Dynamite"" a great film as so many of it's successes are on a visual scale, but here goes:First of all, several reviewers have attempted to justify Napolean and the other characters as being likable on some level. It's my contention that for a movie to work the primary characters don't have to be likable, just interesting: you could make an entire Star Wars trilogy with Darth Vader as the main character and people would still eat that sh*t up. Napolean is definitely not likable in the sense that you would have wanted him as a playground chum in high school, and neither are most of the characters likable in this sense, but herein lies the genius of the movie: you can watch all these amusingly annoying characters from a distance without the burden of having to interact with them in real life. Everyone out there had someone in school who they thought were interesting in one regard or another, but refused to hang out with them because the other 90% of their personality was out of whack, and it's the same principle with watching Napolean.John Heder's characterization of Napolean has to be commended first and foremost. We're never required to feel sorry for Napolean because he never seems to care too much what anyone thinks; life is merely an endless series of inconveniences rather than humiliations. Perhaps it's this lack of need for empathy that leads some reviewers to dismiss the quality of the film, but personally I feel that a viewer who can only get something out of a movie if he/she can directly relate the characters and events in the movie to their own life is missing out on much, not only in the realm of cinema but most likely the lessons of life in general.If anyone is even more of a geek than Napolean it's his brother Kip, who talks with an effeminate lisp and, at the age of 32, is apparently content to live with his Grandma and talk in chatrooms all day. At this it should be mentioned that the chronology of the film is somewhat confusing: 90% of the visual and plot cues would lead one to believe the films takes place in the 80s -- most of the soundtrack music is from the 80s, Napolean's wardrobe is definitely old school, and the appearance and mannerisms of the auxiliary characters have much in common with teen flicks of the 80s as well -- but here and there are sprinkled references that are decidedly 90s in character -- Kip's use of the internet to hook up with his ""soul mate"", for instance, as well as a few other key soundtrack tunes. This isn't a crippling defect, however; there is little about ""Napolean Dynamite"" that strives to be a period piece, and if anything the out-of-touch world of his Idaho surroundings portray an existence that time has, for the most part, simply passed by.Of course, all of this would mean little if the characters were merely left to compete for laughs, but what makes ""Napolean Dynamite"" work is it's perceptiveness. Yes, many of the characters are stereotypes in a fashion, but high school hallways are filled with stereotypes yet to be fleshed out into distinct human beings, and neither is there an adolescent stereotype omitted nor a false interaction between any of them. All of the characters behave toward each other exactly as you'd expect them to, although it must be said Napolean and the rest of the ""geeks"" operate on a slightly more unpredictable scale, largely because they are outcasts living in other peoples' world, and it's not their place to shape events but to react to them. The way that Napolean, Pedro, Deb and even Uncle Rico and Kip adapt to their surroundings may not always seem common, but to the extent that their personalities are developed there is never a false movie between them. The film is mostly episodic, necessarily so as it sets up various scenarios and steps back while it's characters react to them, but as there are no dull moments to wade through ""Napolean Dynamite"" can only be considered a major ""flippin'"" success.",5,Understated classic,1127952000,"09 29, 2005",2005,3999,"['Christ', 'hard', 'spell', 'out', 'what', 'Napolean', 'Dynamite', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'successes', 'are', 'visual', 'scale', 'here', 'First', 'all', 'several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'attempted', 'justify', 'Napolean', 'other', 'characters', 'being', 'likable', 'level', 'contention', 'movie', 'work', 'primary', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'likable', 'just', 'interesting', 'could', 'make', 'entire', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'main', 'character', 'people', 'would', 'still', 'eat', 'up', 'Napolean', 'definitely', 'not', 'likable', 'sense', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'playground', 'chum', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'most', 'characters', 'likable', 'sense', 'herein', 'genius', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'amusingly', 'annoying', 'characters', 'distance', 'burden', 'having', 'interact', 'real', 'life', 'Everyone', 'there', 'had', 'someone', 'school', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'interesting', 'one', 'regard', 'refused', 'hang', 'out', 'other', '90', '%', 'personality', 'was', 'whack', 'same', 'principle', 'watching', 'Napolean.John', 'Heder', 'characterization', 'Napolean', 'be', 'commended', 'first', 'foremost', ""'re"", 'never', 'required', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Napolean', 'never', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'anyone', 'life', 'merely', 'endless', 'series', 'inconveniences', 'rather', 'humiliations', 'Perhaps', 'lack', 'need', 'empathy', 'reviewers', 'dismiss', 'quality', 'film', 'personally', 'feel', 'viewer', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'something', 'movie', 'he/she', 'can', 'directly', 'relate', 'characters', 'events', 'movie', 'own', 'life', 'missing', 'out', 'much', 'not', 'only', 'realm', 'cinema', 'most', 'likely', 'lessons', 'life', 'general.If', 'anyone', 'even', 'more', 'geek', 'Napolean', 'brother', 'Kip', 'who', 'effeminate', 'lisp', 'age', '32', 'apparently', 'content', 'live', 'Grandma', 'talk', 'chatrooms', 'day', 'should', 'be', 'mentioned', 'chronology', 'film', 'somewhat', 'confusing', '90', '%', 'visual', 'plot', 'cues', 'would', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'films', 'place', '80s', 'most', 'soundtrack', 'music', '80s', 'Napolean', 'wardrobe', 'definitely', 'old', 'school', 'appearance', 'mannerisms', 'auxiliary', 'characters', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'teen', 'flicks', '80s', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'references', 'are', 'decidedly', '90s', 'character', 'Kip', 'use', 'internet', 'hook', 'up', 'soul', 'mate', 'instance', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'other', 'key', 'soundtrack', 'tunes', ""n't"", 'crippling', 'defect', 'however', 'little', 'Napolean', 'Dynamite', 'be', 'period', 'piece', 'anything', 'out-of-touch', 'world', 'Idaho', 'surroundings', 'portray', 'existence', 'time', 'most', 'part', 'simply', 'passed', 'by.Of', 'course', 'would', 'mean', 'little', 'characters', 'were', 'merely', 'left', 'compete', 'laughs', 'what', 'Napolean', 'Dynamite', 'work', 'perceptiveness', 'Yes', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'fashion', 'high', 'school', 'hallways', 'are', 'filled', 'stereotypes', 'yet', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'distinct', 'human', 'beings', 'adolescent', 'stereotype', 'omitted', 'false', 'interaction', 'characters', 'behave', 'other', 'exactly', ""'d"", 'expect', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'Napolean', 'rest', 'geeks', 'operate', 'slightly', 'more', 'unpredictable', 'scale', 'largely', 'are', 'outcasts', 'living', 'other', 'peoples', 'world', 'not', 'place', 'shape', 'events', 'react', 'way', 'Napolean', 'Pedro', 'Deb', 'even', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'Kip', 'adapt', 'surroundings', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'seem', 'common', 'extent', 'personalities', 'are', 'developed', 'never', 'false', 'movie', 'film', 'mostly', 'episodic', 'necessarily', 'so', 'up', 'various', 'scenarios', 'steps', 'back', 'characters', 'react', 'are', 'dull', 'moments', 'wade', 'Napolean', 'Dynamite', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'considered', 'major', 'flippin', 'success']",Napoleon Dynamite

While this movie does not seem to appeal to the type of crowd that doesn't appreciate obscurity, anyone else can't help but laugh at the antics of this odd teen from Preston, Idaho.  The movie is nothing more than a look into Napoleon's awkward life, so if you're looking for a deep, engrossing movie, you might want to look elsewhere.  Every character in this movie is memorable in my mind, whether it be Napoleon with his taste for drawing fantasy figures or Uncle Rico with his apparent desire to go back to a simpler time (that time being the 80's).  Simply put, this movie is hilarious thoughout, a shear pleasure to watch.  The fact that it is free of any sort of obscenity or profanity is refreshing in a time when no good movie is capable of getting anything less than a PG-13 rating.

The movie is pretty pointless but it's still pretty funny and often even heart-felt. Roger Ebert claimed that the movie made no attempt to make Napoleon likeable. Well that's totally wrong. He can be a jerk but he also does some good things in the movie. When a kid gets bullied and picked on in school, he offers him protection from his friend Padro's big cousins. When Padro is running for president and doesn't know he's supposed to do a dance number. Napoleon dances for the audience instead. So what's not likeable about that. If he wasn't likeable then why would so many people love this movie and love the character.What makes the movie pointless is that it just ends basically and basically just lives with no plot. His annoying uncle moves in after Napoleon's Grandma has an accident. He hands out flyers to women telling them he can help them get bigger boobs. Which makes people laugh at Napoleon more than they do already. So he wants to get rid of his uncle but he won't leave. Does his uncle ever actually leave ? I'm not even sure. But I can forgive a movie this fun and a hilarious for not really leading anywhere. All the characters are original and funny and they're well played by the actors as well. The best scene is when Napoleon and his brother think they actually own a time machine that will send them back to the past. They just casually try it out like owning a time machine would be normal or possible.

It's basically follows the model of dozens of nerd wish fulfillment movies and TV shows, to the point of parody. It works because of its unique rhythm, odd characters, constant surprises, funny deadpan dialogue, inventive sight gags, and outrageous performances.  Napoleon is a nerd, but he's a stalwart nerd who basically doesn't want to change any more than is absolutely necessary.  He's stoically willing to pay the price, and he spends half his time dealing with people who are even stranger than himself--especially equally out-of-it brother and his smarmy uncle. Kip Dynamite, the older brother, looks like Wally Cox on the Atkins plan.  The uncle is Napoleon's true nemesis, a pathetically overconfident salesman of products that nobody wants.The story pivots around two events:  Napoleon's realization that to win the girl he seems, ambivalently, to want, he needs ""skills""; and the arrival of Kip's girlfriend, a woman he met in an internet chat room. Shortly after her hilarious arrival, and her transformation of Kip into a mutant hip-hopper, she hands Napoleon a crucial gift.  The result is a huge comic payoff that, on reflection, makes no sense, but is such a bizarre and hilarious surprise, you buy it because it's too good to question.

Its very deadpan humor might rub some people the wrong way -- but for me and for many, the humor hits the bullseye.  Napoleon is a nerd who hits the pinnacle of nerdiness and yet seems to exude a common sense sadly lacking in his brother and his uncle.  His classmates are all easily recognizable for us all because they bear such a close resemblance to reality.  I think just about everyone has had a Pedro, a Napoleon, and a Summer in their past.  The film is funny because the characters are real.  The barebones and almost plotless story is hilarious because it, too, is real.In a tongue and cheek sort of way, Napoleon and his friends are elevated, in a certain sense, to a new level of respectability.  Without giving away the plot, we are are rooting for Pedro and happy for Napoleon.  Nerdy beyond nerdiness, ordinary beyond ordinariness, both characters win our hearts because they don't seem to be actors in the latest comedy film.  They seem to be real people.Best of all, the film keeps any crude humor to the bare minimum.  Instead, it finds its humor in the bizarre happenings of everyday life.  It is genuinely funny in its own right -- a rarity these days.Those who are looking for arthouse cinema, as some other reviewers have, are looking in the wrong place.  I'm a big fan of some great filmmakers, including Ozu, Kurosawa, and Satyjit Ray, but this film is not meant to be high art.

628407,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B00005JNBQ,Jonathan Appleseed,"[2, 4]","4.5 stars.Well, once again I find myself asking: Has Roger Ebert lost his mind? He gave this film one and a half stars. That is, frankly, inane. He makes a comparison between this film and films with Adam Sandler, saying that you like an Adam Sandler film because Adam Sandler is in the film, and this is the type of film that falls into that category.Wow. Was he on drugs?He has certainly lost whatever edge he had when Gene Siskel passed away, and that's seen in so, so many films that he has reviewed since that sad day. I can't help but think that if ""Siskel and Ebert"" was still a show, if Siskel was still alive, that Ebert would have realized that this film isn't simply a stupid film about a character we're not supposed to like.OK. Is Napoleon Dynamite a character we're supposed to like or relate to? If you've ever been in high school, which most of us have, we have seen a character like Napoleon Dynamite. He is absolutely clueless, is a ""nerd"" to the thousandth degree - but that's why we like him! If we're still in high school, then perhaps we would laugh at him and think it's not only funny, but appropriate, for him to be picked on and teased by his peers. However, most of us are out of high school, and most of us - if we have any sense of moral decency - regret that we ever made fun of or picked on anyone like Napoleon. To me, THAT is part of what this film is about. His ""victory"" at the end is not something to be mocked. It's more of a victory that would probably come years down the road - but that wasn't the nature of this film, so they showed us that victory in a somewhat shortened sense.One of the most memorable lines in the film to me was Napoleon's comment that (and this may be paraphrased) ""girls like guys who have skills"". Was that not true in high school? Of course it was! I know many girls that I went to high school with that deeply regret the indifference they showed to people like Napoleon. I myself, while not being a ""jock stud"" feel awful when I think of the people that I completely neglected or poked fun at people like Napoleon. Heck, to some people, I was Napoleon. This was very gutsy and accurate portrayal of high school.So what's wrong with a film where the ""nerd"" comes out on top? Absolutely nothing.And what's wrong if we laugh along the way? The humor was so subtle, not side-splitting laughter, but it was there. And that was the essence of the film: subtlety.

I'll be the first to admit that the Napoleon Dynamite quoting craze is getting a bit ridiculous, but why not, there are more classic quotes in this movie then one mind could possibly think of. I've read alot of the negative reviews for this movie and I totally understand most of them. ND is not for everyone. Especially if you need comedy shoved down your throat. It moves quite slow and has no real plot at all but taht is also what makes this movie great. Its like no other comedy that has ever come out.The characters first of all is what makes this movie great. All i was thinking the first time i saw this movie was Where in the hell did they find the actors to play these characters? Every character is so funny in their own way it's hard to choose a favorite. My personal favorite is Lyle, the old Idaho farmer. The script of this movie and the way the lines are delivered from the actors is also esquisite. This movie are contains alot of physical comedy taht makes it great.  Deb runnign across the yard, Uncle rico making videos of himself, napoleon all sweaty drinking the energy drink, napoleon taking the VOTE FOR SUMMER button and chucking it down the hall, the principal bobbing his head during Summer's skit, the stupid look on coolguy Don's face the whole movie, ND flapping his hands during the Happy Hands Club presentation etc. the list goes on and on. I also love how the story all pulls together in the end with napoleon learning to dance then using his ""skills"" to help Pedro win the election and then Napoleon finally finding someone to play tetherball with him. And the dance scene i think will go down in history as an alltime classic scene. What alos made that scene enjoyable is if a nerd like ND would have danced like that at my  high school we would have given him the same standing ovation.The music in the movie also pulls it together quite well. The cyndi lauper song at the school dance scene is awesome and so is the acoustic song after the ND dance scene. My favorite though is the song played at the end when ND and Deb are playing tetherball. Kip's song after the credits is awesome Too.All in all Napoleon Dynamite really is a hero taht is hard not to fall in love with.""You got like three feet of air that time.""",5,Do the chickens have large talons?,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2319,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'write', 'book', 'here', ""'ll"", 'put', 'two', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'quoting', 'craze', 'getting', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'why', 'not', 'are', 'more', 'classic', 'quotes', 'movie', 'then', 'one', 'mind', 'could', 'possibly', 'think', ""'ve"", 'read', 'alot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', 'totally', 'understand', 'most', 'ND', 'not', 'everyone', 'Especially', 'need', 'comedy', 'shoved', 'down', 'throat', 'quite', 'slow', 'real', 'plot', 'taht', 'also', 'what', 'movie', 'great', 'other', 'comedy', 'ever', 'come', 'out.The', 'characters', 'first', 'what', 'movie', 'great', 'i', 'was', 'thinking', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'Where', 'hell', 'did', 'find', 'actors', 'play', 'characters', 'character', 'so', 'funny', 'own', 'way', 'hard', 'choose', 'favorite', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Lyle', 'old', 'Idaho', 'farmer', 'script', 'movie', 'way', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'actors', 'also', 'esquisite', 'movie', 'are', 'alot', 'physical', 'comedy', 'taht', 'great', 'Deb', 'runnign', 'yard', 'Uncle', 'making', 'videos', 'napoleon', 'sweaty', 'drinking', 'energy', 'drink', 'napoleon', 'taking', 'VOTE', 'FOR', 'SUMMER', 'button', 'chucking', 'down', 'hall', 'principal', 'bobbing', 'head', 'Summer', 'skit', 'stupid', 'look', 'coolguy', 'Don', 'face', 'whole', 'movie', 'ND', 'flapping', 'hands', 'Happy', 'Hands', 'Club', 'presentation', 'etc', 'list', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'story', 'together', 'end', 'napoleon', 'learning', 'dance', 'then', 'using', 'skills', 'help', 'Pedro', 'win', 'election', 'then', 'Napoleon', 'finally', 'finding', 'someone', 'play', 'tetherball', 'dance', 'scene', 'i', 'think', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'alltime', 'classic', 'scene', 'What', 'alos', 'made', 'scene', 'enjoyable', 'nerd', 'ND', 'would', 'have', 'danced', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'same', 'standing', 'ovation.The', 'music', 'movie', 'also', 'together', 'quite', 'well', 'cyndi', 'lauper', 'song', 'school', 'dance', 'scene', 'awesome', 'so', 'acoustic', 'song', 'ND', 'dance', 'scene', 'favorite', 'though', 'song', 'played', 'end', 'when', 'ND', 'Deb', 'are', 'playing', 'tetherball', 'Kip', 'song', 'credits', 'awesome', 'Too.All', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'really', 'hero', 'taht', 'hard', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'got', 'three', 'feet', 'air', 'time']",Napoleon Dynamite

Maybe the fact that they feel constrained from laughing reveals a deep sense of superiority to the world portrayed in this wonderful film. Why is it that some say we should not laugh at others? Is it bcause they laugh out of derision while others laugh out of self-recognition, sympathy and a good dose of irony? I laughed or smiled through this entire film. The only people I felt deserved derision were the bullies and the self absorbed adults.

(Jon Heder that is)Well, this is ridiculous type funny. You'd think I would have gotten that before I rented it, but that's okay.I am bursting out with laughter right now watching him dance.

I can just see the sweat on the screenwriters as they draw up the weirdest people they can imagine, which in reality is a serious case of writer's block. The problem mainly arises when the director refuses to stop assuming that the viewer thinks inactivity and vacuity is infinitely humorous. The acting is overly deadpan, stiff and lethargic-which I assume is on purpose. What ensues is viewer irritation after 10 minutes. This is especially true since the spurts of energy that we do see are irrelevant and gag oriented. This is a series of plotless vignettes,literally plodding on for 1 and 1/2 hours. The humor is odd and the director so self satisfied with his own smugness he didn't step back to think that esoteric for the sake of esoteric is...weird?

Yet totally underrated.It was wonderfully acted, from Napoleon to his afeminine brother and Spanish friend to his side ponytailed love interest/friend.

It is one of the rare movies that you will find that is not afraid to be totally, and completely stupid and that has no point whatsoever. But hey, I love it.Napoleon Dynamite is not your typical highschool student. He is one of those freaks that you made fun of and thanked goodness that you weren't him. But the thing is, Napoleon is completely comfortable with himself and is confident enough to ask the most popular girl in school to play teather ball with him, even though she declined, of course.Napoleon's friends aren't too average either.Let's begin with Pedro (finally, the reason for the endless Vote for Pedro t-shirts). Pedro is the new kid. He's spanish and for some reason, he's kinda popular. He is ready to find a date to the dance and actually gets one. He also decides to run for Class President. And wins.Then there's Deb. The girl Napoleon meets when she shows up on his doorstep selling keychains and Glamour Shots. She's shy and really weird. And she drinks two percent (even when Napoleon says she could drink whole if she wanted). And guess what? Napoleon is in love with her.Next up is Uncle Rico. He has problems. And lots of them. He gets crazy business ideas and will do anything to get them to sell. Including dragging poor Napoleon along with him.And then there's Kip. Kip has been chatting online with babes ALL day. And he's found his soul mate, LaFonda (who happens to be a chubby black woman). But hey, we all have our types.This movie takes place back in the 80's (which I was not alive during so I have no clue what they're talking about).

628439,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,B00005JNBQ,Kendal B. Hunter,"[1, 4]","There are two rival trends today in Mormon comedy. The first, and more unsuccessful, IMHO, embraces the ""Singles Ward"" family of films. There are a mixture of the solid Hale Family of thespians, with a mixture of the Brigham Young University's ""Divine Comedy"" and ""Garrens"" troupes.  They have the more slapstick, and even  Church Talent Night feel to them. In essence, they are the Jay Leno's of Mormondom.The other trend are the independent humorists, such as [...] and this film Napoleon Dynamite.  They are outside the normal institution and organs of Mormon humor, and therefore had to struggle to make their comedy work.  They are the David Lettermens of the Mormondom.  Which is why they are actually funnier.What can I say about this film?  When you present an anti-hero as hero, your competition is primarily the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" franchise.  To his credit, Hess is able to have the same vibe, transplant it to southern Idaho, and throw in some Theater of the Absurd to boot.That is what you are getting, and that is why the film works with so many people.  If, as Carl Matheson assets, ""The Simpsons"" humor is ""hyper-irony,"" then this film's humor is ""hyper-quirkiness.""  It melds Seinfeld ""A show about nothing,"" with Babbitt's mediocrity.  The dialogue is two steps above drivel, but that is the charm of the movie.  You get a series of ""A Slice Of Life"" themes that are like the prop GNDN tubes on Star Trek: ""Goes Nowhere, Does Nothing.""Sometimes I got he feeling that I was watching a so-called ""reality show,"" where a person makes no real intellectual or moral development in the process of the film.  Maybe ND is just a good natured Forrest Gump shipwrecked in Idaho.I think the key to the movie is ND's conceptual reference point. He reminds me of Calvin from the funnies-some panels Hobbes is a stuffed tiger, but in the more interesting panels Hobbs is as alive as Calvin's parents.  C. S. Lewis mentions that he had this same problem growing up: he had the external realm of studies and family, but he has the vibrant inner world of Wagner and Boxon, which at times, was more real than the so-called real world (Surprised By Joy, Chapter 8).ND has the same problem. He speaks of the liger, with it's magical properties, has the retro-80's ""Pegasus Crossing"" sign on his door, and the poster to the classic film ""Dragonslayer.""  He is obsessed with nun-chucks and judo skills, but doesn't quite understand why he should wear the kung-fu pants.  He buys the suit at the Deseret Industries thrift store, but doesn't see that it looks weird, even with his retro 70's looks in the retro 80's town.  For ND, his clothes have become so old, they are back in style again.So there you have him: the fluctuating reference point-he has not quite left the magical stage that most of us leave in out early teens (See ""The Road Less Traveled, p. 86-87).  This magical point of view is his charm is. He is a man-child like Brian Wilson or Wildman Fischer.  If Napoleon grows up, he will either be a total failure, or a monumental success.  With the white horse, things for Napoleon is looking up.NOTE:  for the love of mud, DO NOT DO A SEQUAL!  This film has to end as abruptly as it began.  ND has to stay a retro 70's teenager in a retro 80's town lost somewhere in the retro 00's.  Do anything-a documentary, a prequel, or even a Saturday cartoon series with a breakfast cereal tie-in, but no sequel!",4,NDs' Conceptual reference,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,3414,"['are', 'two', 'rival', 'trends', 'today', 'Mormon', 'comedy', 'first', 'more', 'unsuccessful', 'IMHO', 'Singles', 'Ward', 'family', 'films', 'are', 'mixture', 'solid', 'Hale', 'Family', 'thespians', 'mixture', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'University', 'Divine', 'Comedy', 'Garrens', 'troupes', 'have', 'more', 'slapstick', 'even', 'Church', 'Talent', 'Night', 'feel', 'essence', 'are', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Mormondom.The', 'other', 'trend', 'are', 'independent', 'humorists', 'such', '[', ']', 'film', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'are', 'normal', 'institution', 'organs', 'Mormon', 'humor', 'therefore', 'had', 'struggle', 'make', 'comedy', 'work', 'are', 'David', 'Lettermens', 'Mormondom', 'Which', 'why', 'are', 'actually', 'funnier.What', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'When', 'present', 'anti-hero', 'hero', 'competition', 'primarily', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'franchise', 'credit', 'Hess', 'able', 'have', 'same', 'vibe', 'transplant', 'southern', 'Idaho', 'throw', 'Theater', 'Absurd', 'boot.That', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'Carl', 'Matheson', 'assets', 'Simpsons', 'humor', 'hyper-irony', 'then', 'film', 'humor', 'hyper-quirkiness', 'Seinfeld', 'A', 'show', 'nothing', 'Babbitt', 'mediocrity', 'dialogue', 'two', 'steps', 'drivel', 'charm', 'movie', 'get', 'series', 'A', 'Slice', 'Life', 'themes', 'are', 'prop', 'GNDN', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Goes', 'Nowhere', 'Does', 'Nothing', 'Sometimes', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'so-called', 'reality', 'show', 'where', 'person', 'real', 'intellectual', 'moral', 'development', 'process', 'film', 'Maybe', 'ND', 'just', 'good', 'natured', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'shipwrecked', 'Idaho.I', 'think', 'key', 'movie', 'ND', 'conceptual', 'reference', 'point', 'Calvin', 'funnies-some', 'panels', 'Hobbes', 'stuffed', 'tiger', 'more', 'interesting', 'panels', 'Hobbs', 'as', 'alive', 'Calvin', 'parents', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'mentions', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'growing', 'up', 'had', 'external', 'realm', 'studies', 'family', 'vibrant', 'inner', 'world', 'Wagner', 'Boxon', 'times', 'was', 'more', 'real', 'so-called', 'real', 'world', 'Surprised', 'Joy', 'Chapter', '8', '.ND', 'same', 'problem', 'liger', 'magical', 'properties', 'retro-80', 'Pegasus', 'Crossing', 'sign', 'door', 'poster', 'classic', 'film', 'Dragonslayer', 'obsessed', 'nun-chucks', 'judo', 'skills', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'should', 'wear', 'kung-fu', 'pants', 'suit', 'Deseret', 'Industries', 'thrift', 'store', ""n't"", 'see', 'weird', 'even', 'retro', '70', 'looks', 'retro', '80', 'town', 'ND', 'clothes', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'old', 'are', 'back', 'style', 'again.So', 'there', 'have', 'fluctuating', 'reference', 'point-he', 'not', 'quite', 'left', 'magical', 'stage', 'most', 'leave', 'out', 'early', 'teens', 'See', 'Road', 'Less', 'Traveled', '86-87', 'magical', 'point', 'view', 'charm', 'man-child', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Wildman', 'Fischer', 'Napoleon', 'up', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'total', 'failure', 'monumental', 'success', 'white', 'horse', 'things', 'Napoleon', 'looking', 'up.NOTE', 'love', 'mud', 'DO', 'NOT', 'DO', 'SEQUAL', 'film', 'end', 'as', 'abruptly', 'began', 'ND', 'stay', 'retro', '70', 'teenager', 'retro', '80', 'town', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'retro', '00', 'Do', 'anything-a', 'documentary', 'prequel', 'even', 'Saturday', 'cartoon', 'series', 'breakfast', 'cereal', 'tie-in', 'sequel']",Napoleon Dynamite

Close behind is 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Tommy Boy'. Other faves are 'Airplane!' and 'Police Academy'. In other words, I know a funny movie when I see it.

If you haven't seen the movies I mentioned (especially 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'), I highly recommend you see what you're missing. The only reason that this movie can do so well among young people (of which I am one -- 22 years old) is because they (we) have been deprived of quality comedies (1995's 'Tommy Boy' being the last great comedy).If you think trite jokes about a guy ""stuck in the 80's"" are funny, then, by all means, get 'Napoleon Dynamite'.

Some of us(like myself), have been the geek one too many times.  This film lets us laugh at those who are geeks, those who beat up the geeks, and the snobby little popular girls who toy with the geeks.The film is basically about a few days in the life of a not-so-likeable dork named Napoleon, and his more likeable friend, Pedro, as well as his chatroom-happy brother, Kip, and his uncle, Rico.  They are all losers in one way or another.  Rico's trapped in the past, like so many former high school jocks.  Kip has fallen in love with his on-line friend he has never met.  Pedro is just kind of there, too shy to really stand out.  Then there's Napoleon.  He is in a class all to himself.  He draws fantasy creatures(I can relate), likes to save tater tots for later(in his pockets, unwrapped), and is pretty annoying all in all.Pedro is in love with the school's most popular girl(Hilary Duff's sister), but she doesn't even know he exists, until he decides to run against her for class president.  Even then, she blows him off as no threat.  Napoleon is sort of his campaign manager and his ""secret service captain.""  He also sort of pursues Deb, another geek played perfectly by Tina Majorino.  She's been in a ton of films, primarily playing a child.  The only one that comes to mind right now is ""Waterworld.""  Kip's internet love comes to visit and she turns out to be an amazonian black beauty who changes his life forever.  Rico still clings to what might have been.The humor of this film is scattered over brief moments in the lives of the aforementioned geeks.  They get beat up, picked on, etc., just like any normal kid who was the outcast in school.  Whether or not you feel guilty for laughing at them, you have to laugh because the best humor is found in the truth, and this film is loaded with that.Highly recommended to folks who are willing to watch this film more than once because you will definitely catch things that you missed before.  It is definitely worthy of multiple viewings.Also, stick around after the credits role to see one of the best moments of the film.

628448,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNBQ,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 5]","The director Jared Hess brings the viewers a minimalistic comedy about a complete loser, Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), with no self-esteem, skills, or friends.  The film is on occasion offensively straightforward as it pokes directly on Napoleon through the way he dresses, behaves, and how people around him act toward him.  Several geek films has been made in the past such as Revenge of the Nerds (1984), Rushmore (1998), and American Pie (1999), but Napoleon Dynamite delivers a film unique in the sense that it is directly making fun of the nerd.  This is, on occasion, hilarious as the things that Napoleon does seem awkward and embarrassing, yet there is a finer touch of compassion for him as he struggles with his daily endeavors.  In a sense it becomes much like a clown show at a circus.  It is funny, but at the expense of the main character.The film displays a number of episodic events that comprise a cinematic montage of Napoleon's lifestyle.  Through the montage the audience learns that Napoleon lives with his grandmother and his older brother, that is a nerd much like himself.  The mise-en-scene and the script also lays out the groundwork for why Napoleon is a nerd, as nobody really offers him help with anything.  This tall gangly high school kid that constantly has his mouth open while he peaks through his glasses like a mole attempts to separate the shadows in order to distinguish what is in front of him.  It is impossible not to feel sorry for him while laughing at his idiosyncrasies.The audience is presented with how he becomes friends with Pedro (Efren Ramirez), a new student in his school, and with Deb (Tina Majorino).  Through their minute help Napoleon finds an insignificant amount of courage as it provides him with enough hope to begin regaining some of his lost self-esteem.  The quest for something better also has it's difficulties as Napoleon must deal with his scheming uncle Rico, who brings his older brother into his schemes, as they also offend him in public.  The struggle that Napoleon is fighting is for his own place in society as he wants something better, yet his awkwardness within society makes it difficult for him to adjust.  Besides Napoleon's struggle there are several amusing situations such as when he must feed his grandmother's lama and the drawing he sends to a girl he wants to ask out to an upcoming school dance.The opening credits seem to have been influenced by Dogma 95 as it uses food and pictures in order to introduce the cast and crew of the film.  Nonetheless, it is a fun and clever beginning that sets the tone for the rest of the film.  The camera work and story bear some similarities with Rushmore (1998) and Royal Tenenbaums (2001) by Wes Anderson, but it does not copy these films as it remains unique.  The story is fragmented in chronological order and Napoleon leaves a lasting imprint with the audience.

Napoleon is a rural supernerd who doesn't want or need the acceptance of those around him.  He doesn't long to be popular, he doesn't really care what people think of him, he just wants the space to be himself.What's great about the character is that Naploen doesn't really change at all through the course of the movie.  Sure, he helps a friend win a student election and manages to find a girl; but these are the result of Napoleon being who he is, not because he changed or grew into something else.  He starts the movie as an almost monotonal, oblivious, strangely dressed little boy - and that's exactly how he is at the end of the movie.  He doesn't even seem to realize it, but he's changed a lot of the people around him.  Pedro gets some self confidence, Deb finds a guy who accepts her, Kip is happy, and even uncle Rico manages to stumble into a good deal.Not that I care one way or the other, but the movie manages to be enormously entertaining without resorting to potty humor or wholesale swearing even once.  An impressive feat considering the status quo of ""comedies"" these days.My only gripe would be with the ""extra"" scene that was added in after the credits when the movie started earning some bucks.  It really just seems tacked on and kind of pointless.  I would have rather seen a few more minutes at the chicken farm, or some time spent showing how Rico met his girlfriend, or even some more of Napoleon as the biggest kid on the school bus. The tetherball game was the perfect ending for this movie, and nothing was gained by the addition of the new post-credits scene.If you want something to compare it to, it carries a lot of the same pleasantly deluded loser vibe that ""Bottle Rocket"" had, along with a similarly great soundtrack.  It's a great date movie, and a superior original low-budget comedy.Now if I can only get my hands on a D-Qwon's Dance-grooves VHS, I'll be OK.",5,"Dude, you got like 2 feet of air.",1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2071,"['One', 'earlier', 'reviewers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'critiquing', 'frequently', 'clueless', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'complete', 'misunderstanding', 'character', 'movie', 'Napoleon', 'rural', 'supernerd', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'need', 'acceptance', ""n't"", 'long', 'be', 'popular', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'just', 'space', 'be', 'himself.What', 'great', 'character', 'Naploen', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'course', 'movie', 'Sure', 'friend', 'student', 'election', 'find', 'girl', 'are', 'result', 'Napoleon', 'being', 'who', 'not', 'changed', 'grew', 'something', 'else', 'movie', 'almost', 'monotonal', 'oblivious', 'strangely', 'dressed', 'little', 'boy', 'exactly', 'how', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'realize', 'changed', 'lot', 'people', 'Pedro', 'self', 'confidence', 'Deb', 'guy', 'who', 'Kip', 'happy', 'even', 'uncle', 'Rico', 'manages', 'stumble', 'good', 'deal.Not', 'care', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'movie', 'be', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'resorting', 'potty', 'humor', 'wholesale', 'swearing', 'even', 'once', 'impressive', 'feat', 'considering', 'status', 'quo', 'comedies', 'only', 'gripe', 'would', 'be', 'extra', 'scene', 'was', 'added', 'credits', 'when', 'movie', 'started', 'earning', 'bucks', 'really', 'just', 'tacked', 'kind', 'pointless', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'few', 'more', 'minutes', 'chicken', 'farm', 'time', 'spent', 'showing', 'how', 'Rico', 'met', 'girlfriend', 'even', 'more', 'Napoleon', 'biggest', 'kid', 'school', 'bus', 'tetherball', 'game', 'was', 'perfect', 'ending', 'movie', 'nothing', 'was', 'gained', 'addition', 'new', 'post-credits', 'scene.If', 'want', 'something', 'compare', 'lot', 'same', 'pleasantly', 'deluded', 'loser', 'vibe', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'had', 'similarly', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'date', 'movie', 'superior', 'original', 'low-budget', 'comedy.Now', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'hands', 'D-Qwon', 'Dance-grooves', 'VHS', ""'ll"", 'be', 'OK']",Napoleon Dynamite

His pasty-skinned brother, an uncle stuck in his own past glory days and the shy girl with a crush are all perfectly crafted as well. My favorite scenes were when Napoleon drew the picture of the girl he wanted to take to the dance for her and his note was like 'there's plenty more where this came from' and the drawing is the most grotesque, childish likeness of the girl. Then when Pedro is running for class president, Napoleon gives a nerd getting bullied a boondoggle keychain and says 'Pedro offers you his protection', then when the school bully tries to take the kid's bike, Pedro's cousins in the low rider come by.

Then you are in the club of Napoleon uninitiated those whom have not bothered to look into this odd phenomenon known as ""Napoleon Dynamite.""  Well now is your chance to see what all the hoopla is about!I myself have a sister who works in a Hot Topic, so every time I went in there, I became bombarded by the mass of Napoleon merchandise.  Despite this, it never drove me to enough curiosity to rent it and watch it.  It looked stupid, it looked pointless, and way over publicized, indeed, it was all these things and much more!Napoleon Dynamite is one of those movies that are so dumb and stupid, yet so good-natured and light-hearted, that you cannot deny it is at least mildly entertaining.  I am betting that your personal entertainment value in this movie, depends mostly on if you can enjoy nothing movies.  As this very well may be one of the biggest nothing movies made.  That is what makes it so entertaining, because it makes light of High School films in general and family life.  It makes all of us, in comparison, look like celebrities in our ""normality"".The character Napoleon Dynamite himself is such an oddball, so geeky, so weird, and gawky that anyone else around him looks cool.  The great thing about him is that he is so sure that he is cool and so sure that people must like him, just because of who he is.  Honestly I do, its hard not to like someone who is so silly, so positive that he is hot, and totally clueless, it is just sweet.There is not a whole lot of plot going on here, but it works, the whole flow of the movie is relaxed, but it works. The characters just sort of float in and out, they just sort of eek by an existence.  At the same time though, these characters are so absurd that you cannot help but wait until they come back on the screen. Characters like Uncle Rico and Kip are absurd, but at the same time, not very far-fetched.  Pedro is no doubt one of the favorites, as the clueless and geeky Mexican newcomer who runs for class president, and is Napoleon's only friend.The characters are delightfully nutty, and they make the meet of this film. Napoleon being the crux, with his sleepy-eyed expressions, open-mouth breathing, random saying such as: ""Fricking Idiots!"", ""Sweet"", and ""Get your own Tots."".  If smirk does not at least form on your lips, there may just be something wrong with you, like maybe you are dead?Hopefully, you're full alive, and you fully enjoy Napoleon Dynamite, or at least enjoy it just a little bit.

Napoleon is a high school student that most of his peers consider weird. His brother is in his 30's and lives in on-line chatrooms. The grandmother taking care of Napoleon and his brother is injured in a dune buggy accident and sends Uncle Rico to take care of Napoleon and his brother.Napoleon's Uncle Rico is another quirky character their caregiver and ""flim-flam"" man. Always with different schemes to make a buck. Napoleon finally starts to look at life a bit differently when he befriends a new student,Pedro.

I mean people on here are saying that they would never date a person just because he/she liked this movie.

The movie is supposed to be uneventful. But if you pay attention to the nuances, the slight glances, you might understand a bit more. For instance, when Napoleon is carrying the chickens to their new cages and he puts them in, he does so with the utmost care and then, he looks around at the chaos and filth that these chickens are forced to live and runs from the coop at top speed. For all the dirt and aggravation of working on the chicken farm he gets paid $1 an hour. Now who can't think of other people in our country who have to deal with that in a real-life scenario?I am not going to get philosophical about the themes of this movie because in my opinion you either get this movie or you don't, either you are a literal or figurative thinker, either you can enjoy things that have a circular pattern or you are more linear. The point is you don't HAVE to like this movie. No one is forcing you to jump up and down with glee! You also don't need to be so spiteful to those of us who do like it.

628475,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00005JNBQ,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[7, 10]","This movie is like infinity times better than the last million movies I've seen.  You should definitely quit chatting with babes on the internet and check it out!What happens when you take a cast of unknowns (except for one actor who's biggest other parts were in ""The Country Bears"" and playing Jethro in the movie of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"") and combine them with a script about high school geeks where the entire plot could be described in 3 sentences?Magic happens.Jared Hess and wife Jerusha co-wrote the script and John Heder brings to life  Napoleon Dynamite, an awkward Idaho high-schooler who is sooooo far from cool.  He is tall and gangly, all knees and elbows with an unruly mop of orange hair. Like all teenagers, he has dreams about being more than he is, but poor Napoleon is so far from the mainstream that he doesn't bother dreaming about things your average teenager fantasizes about.  When the other kids dream about going to the major leagues, becoming a movie star or getting into medical school.  Napoleon would be satisfied to have ""computer hacking skills"" or ""numchuck skills"".  Like a lot of high-school geeks, Napoleon spends a lot of time drawing fantasy pictures, and because he's Napoleon, they're not very good.  Unlike the geeks in, for example, the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" movies, Napoleon is so clueless he doesn't recognize how far out of the mainstream he is.  At one point he decides to impress a girl by drawing her portrait.  He gives her the pitiful drawing and tells her ""I spent like three hours doing shading the upper lip. It's probably the best drawing I've ever done.""In the universe of this movie, Napoleon almost fits right in, because his family is dysfunctional in the extreme.  (There's never even a mention of his parents.) Napoleon lives at home with his thrill-seeking grandmother and 30-something loser brother, Kip.  In many ways Kip is more pitiful than Napoleon because he's had an extra dozen years or so to develop into... a guy who spends all his time on the internet ""chatting with babes"". (One of the best sequences of the film comes later on when his online girlfriend, LaFawnduh, actually takes a bus out to the middle of nowhere to meet Kip.)The film is populated by other lovable losers like Pedro, a dull boy who imagines that he can get the most popular girl in school to like him if he bakes her a cake. Uncle Rico, another odd family member, comes to babysit Napoleon (and 30 year old Kip) after Grandma is injured in a scene that couldn't have been better if Larry, Curley and Moe had been in it.  Uncle Rico dwells on his high-school football glory, when his team WOULD have won the big game if the coach had only put him in at quarterback.The allure in the film comes from the characters, their situations and especially their language.  You just have to SEE it to get the magic in lines like ""Hey, Napoleon, what are you gonna do today?"" ""Whatever I feel like I wanna do. Gosh!""This movie is lightning in a bottle.

When his grandma gets injured on a day trip, Creepy Uncle Rico comes to take care of Kip and Napoleon.

The music collected for this film is eclectic and light.  The soundtrack - with sound bites taken from the movie between songs - is a precious addition to the film.Doesn't sound like much?  That's the magic.  The ""high point"" of the film is a risky run for class president.

628479,A25ACLV5KPB4W,B00005JNBQ,"Matt Hetling ""Matt""","[0, 0]","This isn't a movie to over-intellectualize or read into. This is a movie to enjoy.Napoleon Dynamite is about a high school student who is the geek of all geeks. Breaking with Hollywood tradition, this Napoleon isn't appealing because he's misunderstood, or because his heart of gold is continually tramped on by school bullies. The whole appeal of Napoleon is that he's completely and utterly pathetic.His interests range from nun-chucks to the Loch Ness Monster to drawing bad pictures. He is intimidated by the school bullies, but cruel to those who won't retaliate against him. He is completely self-centered, and his self-serving ulterior motives are completely transparent.Napoleon lives in his rural Idaho home with his dramatically older, and seemingly mentally handicapped, brother Kip, who spends all day chatting on the internet to women. Usually, they are cared for by their grandmother, but she has been called away unexpectedly, and so they are supervised by their uncle, who is constantly reliving his non-glory days on the high school football team and trying to sell tupperware or other things to the local housewives.There's not much of a plot to this movie; it's mostly just a string of intensely hilarious scenes which feature Napoleon or the quirky members of his growing world. Toward the end, a plot evolves out of a race for school president between Summer, the popular girl, and Napoleon's only friend (and seemingly the only Mexican student).The 11th hour vindication seems like a cheat, but at least Napoleon isn't carried away on the shoulders on a wave of newfound popularity. Instead, he finds someone to play tetherball with, and this quiet triumph is a good place to end it.This movie will stick in your mind, and Napoleon will stay with you in the same way that the Billy Bob Thornton character in Sling Blade does. He is so bizarre, and yet so like someone you went to high school with, that he is impossible to forget.Most of all, the inventive and hilarious character-driven jokes will crack you up. If you're going to rent one movie this year, make it this one. We all need a good laugh.The DVD itself is kind of sparsely featured, although it does have a few extra glimpses of Napoleon, which is all you can ask for.",5,Movie of the Year,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,2253,"[""n't"", 'movie', 'over-intellectualize', 'read', 'movie', 'enjoy.Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'geek', 'geeks', 'Breaking', 'Hollywood', 'tradition', 'Napoleon', ""n't"", 'appealing', 'misunderstood', 'heart', 'gold', 'continually', 'tramped', 'school', 'bullies', 'whole', 'appeal', 'Napoleon', 'completely', 'utterly', 'pathetic.His', 'interests', 'range', 'nun-chucks', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Monster', 'drawing', 'bad', 'pictures', 'intimidated', 'school', 'bullies', 'cruel', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'retaliate', 'completely', 'self-centered', 'self-serving', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'are', 'completely', 'transparent.Napoleon', 'lives', 'rural', 'Idaho', 'home', 'dramatically', 'older', 'seemingly', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'brother', 'Kip', 'who', 'day', 'chatting', 'internet', 'women', 'Usually', 'are', 'cared', 'grandmother', 'been', 'called', 'away', 'unexpectedly', 'so', 'are', 'supervised', 'uncle', 'who', 'constantly', 'reliving', 'non-glory', 'days', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'trying', 'sell', 'tupperware', 'other', 'things', 'local', 'housewives.There', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'mostly', 'just', 'string', 'intensely', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'feature', 'Napoleon', 'quirky', 'members', 'growing', 'world', 'end', 'plot', 'race', 'school', 'president', 'Summer', 'popular', 'girl', 'Napoleon', 'only', 'friend', 'seemingly', 'only', 'Mexican', 'student', '11th', 'hour', 'vindication', 'cheat', 'least', 'Napoleon', ""n't"", 'carried', 'away', 'shoulders', 'wave', 'newfound', 'popularity', 'Instead', 'someone', 'play', 'tetherball', 'quiet', 'triumph', 'good', 'place', 'end', 'it.This', 'movie', 'will', 'stick', 'mind', 'Napoleon', 'will', 'stay', 'same', 'way', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'character', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'so', 'bizarre', 'yet', 'so', 'someone', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'impossible', 'forget.Most', 'inventive', 'hilarious', 'character-driven', 'jokes', 'will', 'crack', 'up', ""'re"", 'going', 'rent', 'one', 'movie', 'year', 'make', 'one', 'need', 'good', 'laugh.The', 'DVD', 'kind', 'sparsely', 'featured', 'have', 'few', 'extra', 'glimpses', 'Napoleon', 'can', 'ask']",Napoleon Dynamite

That said, I must say this is my favorite movie of 2004, and quite possibly the best movie of 2004.  The beauty of this movie is the fact that it didn't have to rely on any special effects, turn in plots or points it was trying to make with the viewer.  This movie is pure genius.  My uncle hated this movie.  After many viewings and a lot of thought I can come to only one conclusion why.  He is shallow and close minded.  If you don't have a broud sense of humor, or appreciation for every little thing that make a movie great, then you better skip this one.  Jon Heder (the actor who played Napoleon) is not like this in real life, in fact he's married and quite down to earth.  In this movie you never once find him even close to out of character.  Yeah this isn't a drama, but the acting it incredible.  The whole cast is convincing to the point that you forget they are acting and in your mind you can't picture them any other way.  This is one of the most original films I have ever seen.  I love everything about it.  It's back to the basics film making with this movie, like when movies had to rely on acting and a great script, not like many of todays over priced CG reliant films that are so common these days.

It turns out this isn't entirely true. I guess you could see this film as a postmodern character study or a statement about the strange psychological development of an eccentric adolescent. But of course if I did that then it would betray the very thing that the movie is about, which is: not much. It's basically a movie about a goofy kid who comes from a goofy family who incessantly does and says goofy but hilarious things.

No characters in the movie seem to speak up or at a higher level then the next one.  I didn't really see this until my second time watching the film.  I am still unsure when this movie takes place.  Everything has a look and feel of being around the late 80's but there are more modern references and music so I have assumed that it is like that because they live in such a small town.

He has no friends, and no girls appear to fancy him. Mainly because he needs a serious makeover, contacts, a decent hairdresser, and braces.

Napoleon is a new breed of nerd: The Angry Nerd.  Because he's not short, Napoleon is a little too powerful to routinely pick on.  Instead, he's randomly slammed into lockers or mocked in gym.  But Napoleon never curls up into a ball and weeps. He tells people ""SHUT UP! GOSH!"" or ""Freakin idiot!"" through half-closed lids. Everyone knows the Angry Nerd...he's voted Most Likely to Be a Serial Killer by his graduating class.To be fair, Napoleon never had a chance.  We're never told where his parents are, but he lives with his ATV-riding grandmother (Sandy Martin) and his painfully awkward older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Kip has a long distance relationship over the Internet with a woman known only as LaFawnduh (Shondrella Avery). Adding insult to injury, they own a pet llama named Tina and Napoleon has to take the bus to school with elementary kids.And oh yeah, his first name is Napoleon and his last name is Dynamite.Napoleon is also a gamer.  I submit the following evidence:Napoleon draws a manticore that he refers to as a liger. ""It's pretty much my favorite animal,"" says Napoleon. ""It's like a lion and a tiger mixed... bred for its skills in magic."" When faced with a job putting chickens in cages, he asks, ""Do the chickens have large talons?""Yep, that's a guy who plays Dungeons & Dragons all right.Or he would, if he had any friends.  Napoleon eventually makes one friend, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), who is also ostracized at school because he's from Mexico.  The so-white-its-bright faculty and students constantly look down Pedro upon.  But Pedro is confident in his own subtle way.  He asks girls out by baking them cakes and most importantly, he plans to run for school president.Napoleon is not so lucky.  He openly admits he has no skills (if this were a more up-to-date movie, Napoleon would say he has no ""Mad Skillz""). Well, he has the ability to draw.  Unfortunately, he only THINKS he can draw.  His drawing sucks too.So Napoleon lies.  He lies about hunting wolverines, about his amazing martial arts prowess, about his non-existent girlfriend, about pretty much everything.  Since everything Napoleon says is utterly deadpan, there's no easy way to tell if he's lying.When Napoleon's grandmother has an ATV accident, his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to live with them.  There's a subtle irony here: Rico is a failed football star that is perpetually stuck in the 80s.  He is the ghost of the future, a vicious attack on all those high school jocks who would have gone pro if they hadn't messed up that knee.  Rico's entire life is driven by one goal: to travel backwards in time.  Once he discovers an expensive time travel kit on the Internet that will transport him backwards, he enlists Kip to join his get-rich-quick schemes.  First it's Tupperware, then it's...breast enhancement products.Yeah, Napoleon never had a chance.In the middle of this insanity, Napoleon bumps into Deb (Tina Majorino), dressed in full 80s attire and trying to sell her friendship bracelets so someone (her? Her mom?) can go to college.  It doesn't go well at first, but it's clear the two are destined for each other.Eventually, Kip meets LaFawnduh, a luscious African-American woman from Detroit.  Her arrival transforms Kip and the entire movie from then on, signaling a change from the 80s death by stagnation to an updated, hipper universe.  No literal time travel happens, but suddenly the movie shifts gears and its 2004 again.  And finally, all the characters begin some real emotional growth.Much of the movie's humor centers on the sympathy or disdain we have for characters like Napoleon.  A lot of the jokes are around mid-Western foils: the white town's reaction to an ethnic student, heavy usage of the word ""sweet,"" and farmers shooting cows (in front of a busload of schoolchildren no less). Not everyone will get the jokes.Perhaps more intriguing is the parallels between this film and Donnie Darko.  Both films have superhero-esque names, both take place in primarily white high schools, both feature racism against a different ethnicity, both have adults teaching kids confidence building skills, both have a serious 80s fetish, and finally both feature an obsession with time travel.  It's likely more people haven't made the connection between the two movies because few audiences have watched both.Unlike Donnie Darko, the broad parodies of white Midwesterners are smeared with racist undertones.  The two ethnic characters play to the most awful racial stereotypes: Pedro has a big family, scary relatives in pimped up cars, and is Catholic while LaFawnduh has long painted nails, lots of gold jewelry, and comes from Detroit.Throughout the film, the director (Jared Hess), makes liberal use of the buzzing sound of a fly.  It's a reminder that whenever we're laughing at Napoleon, we're the big jerks.  Which really argues the point that perhaps this movie isn't supposed to be a comedy after all.Ultimately, Napoleon Dynamite posits the question: what good ARE people like Napoleon?  He's angry, rude, insensitive, socially inept, and seems to be in a perpetual daze most of the time.  What ARE Napoleon's skills?We get the answer in a climactic frenzy of events that culminate in the class election. Pedro promises in his speech that he will make ""all your dreams come true,"" and in a sense, the film's conclusion is precisely that.Sweet!",4,World Meets Angry Nerd (who plays Dungeons &

Clearly, Napoleon Dynamite has escaped a lot of the independent film traps that make them so slow and amateurish. The question then is what makes this such a great film? First, there is the main character Napoleon Dynamite, a perfectly cast nerd who possesses a steely integrity and loyalty to his friends, which makes him sympathetic. This quality is necessary for the film's climax which you'll have to see for yourself. Secondly, the film does an excellent job of capturing innnocence. There is a purity to Napoleon's character that is infectious and endearing. This quality defies those critics who accuse the film of having no heart. The next great thing about the film is the hilarious anecdotage. The writer/director draws from his life in Idaho to create one comic scene after another without trying to be funny. Napoleon's droll, intense expression as he tries to navigate through girls, his competitive brother and his charlatan uncle is classic.One of the wonderful things about this DVD is the director commentary where scene by scene he shares his life experiences and explains how they informed his film.Napoleon Dynamite belongs to the Hall of Fame list of films about misfits: The King of Comedy (starring Robert DeNiro), The Good Girl, Adaptation, You Can Count On Me, Welcome to the Dollhouse, and Ghost World.",5,Nerd Chic Never Looked So Good,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,1513,"[""'m"", 'typically', 'not', 'fond', 'self-conscious', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'films', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'like', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'how', 'funny', 'film', 'Clearly', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'escaped', 'lot', 'independent', 'film', 'traps', 'make', 'so', 'slow', 'amateurish', 'question', 'then', 'what', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'First', 'main', 'character', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'nerd', 'who', 'steely', 'integrity', 'loyalty', 'friends', 'sympathetic', 'quality', 'necessary', 'film', 'climax', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'Secondly', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'innnocence', 'purity', 'Napoleon', 'character', 'infectious', 'endearing', 'quality', 'critics', 'who', 'accuse', 'film', 'having', 'heart', 'next', 'great', 'thing', 'film', 'hilarious', 'anecdotage', 'writer/director', 'draws', 'life', 'Idaho', 'create', 'one', 'comic', 'scene', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'Napoleon', 'droll', 'intense', 'expression', 'navigate', 'girls', 'competitive', 'brother', 'charlatan', 'uncle', 'classic.One', 'wonderful', 'things', 'DVD', 'director', 'commentary', 'where', 'scene', 'scene', 'shares', 'life', 'experiences', 'how', 'informed', 'film.Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'list', 'films', 'misfits', 'King', 'Comedy', 'starring', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Good', 'Girl', 'Adaptation', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'Ghost', 'World']",Napoleon Dynamite

Those who enjoy the predictable, low brow, gross out comedies like Old School or recent hits like Dodgeball will most likely get little enjoyment out of the film, but fans of films of Wes Anderson may find something to admire here.  Taking place in Preston, Idaho, high school student Napoleon (Jon Heder) spends his days either being ignored or ridiculed by his fellow classmates.  His family life isn't much better, with his free loading uncle in the mix and his older brother finding his soul mate via the internet.  Napoleon experiences other adventures, such as an ill-fated trip to the school dance, and helping his friend Pedro run for school president.  Oh yeah, Napoleon dances too.  The comedy is subtle to say the least, so don't go in expecting any laugh out loud scenarios.

628527,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00005JNBQ,Nicholas Carroll,"[3, 8]","I'm surprised by the cult status and financial success of this film.  So many who claim to love this film, if they were honest with themselves would admit that they love laughing at the misfortune of others and looking down on people in order to feel superior, because let's face it...there are loners in high school who don't have any friends, so the people who love this movie so much...just how many loner/nerdy friends do you hang out with?  Just as I thought...none.I believe Roger Ebert is correct in his review of this film...it was made to make people feel superior as they laugh at some of the most pathetic characters to ever grace the silver screen.  The only likeable character in the whole bunch is Deb, though she could use some pointers on which direction her pony tail should go (towards the back, not the side).  This film is all over the map...as the clothing styles of the main characters are holdovers from the polyester and butterfly collar 70s; the interior of the house with wood panel walls and top loading VCRs also put this family in league with the Brady Bunch; the school dance plays classic 80s songs; yet we know its in the 1990s because of Kip Dynamite's surfing the Internet for babes.Napoleon Dynamite is an unlikeable nerd who doesn't have any friends, except for the new Mexican kid, who speaks with all the stereotypical accent of Slow Poke Rodriguez of the Warner Brothers cartoons (cousin of Speedy Gonzalez).  Watching this film, as painful as it is, it shouldn't surprise anyone why Napoleon is always picked on at school and has no friends and can't get a date.  His brother Kip is no better, hanging out at home with no job and getting involved in some salesman schemes when their used-car salesman looking uncle shows up one day with dreams of faded high school glory (""my life would be better if only the coach put me in the game the last quarter of the final game of my senior year!"").  Napoleon and Kip live with their grandmother, who disappears from the movie really quick, as even she can't stand to be around those losers and leaves them to fend for themselves in the cold, brutal, superficial world.Does this movie have a point?  Not really.  It succeeds only if you consider the idea that the director's whole point of this film is to indite us as having superiority complexes for judging and laughing at the patheticness of these characters.  A lot of the scenes have humor in them, and I can easily imagine it going over really well in the Mormon culture of Idaho and Utah, where this film takes place (Preston, Idaho).  That the director is a graduate of BYU, which censored Hollywood films when I attended there, doesn't surprise me, as this film was made to Mormon specifications of ""morality"" (no profanity).  Unfortunately, they don't have a prohibition on bad taste, otherwise this film would've never seen the light of day.Having said all that...its not the worst film I ever saw (that would be ""Barton Fink""...the only film I ever walked out of the theater in the middle of).  I loved the opening credit sequence, which I thought was the most creative I've ever seen.  I also thought the ending was so manipulative in that the choice of song was lyrically brilliant and I couldn't help but smile when the film came to an end.  That was aggravating to me...a film I consider in poor taste that ends on such a brilliant note that I can't call it a complete waste of my time.  There were two other points where the director used two of my all time favorite 1980s songs (""Forever Young"" by Alphaville and ""Time After Time"" by Cyndi Lauper), so I must add one star for the music selection of this film.  I also liked the Llama and wished to have seen more of that.  For me, the funniest moments of the film are with LaFawnduh and with Rex and his bodybuilding wife.  So, those characters saved this film from being a complete wash out with me...thus three stars instead of the automatic one that amazon.com gives all reviews.",3,A discomforting look at the lives of several losers,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,3982,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'cult', 'status', 'financial', 'success', 'film', 'So', 'many', 'who', 'claim', 'love', 'film', 'were', 'honest', 'would', 'admit', 'love', 'laughing', 'misfortune', 'others', 'looking', 'down', 'people', 'order', 'feel', 'superior', 'let', 'face', 'are', 'loners', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'friends', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'loner/nerdy', 'friends', 'do', 'hang', 'out', 'Just', 'thought', 'none.I', 'believe', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'correct', 'review', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'make', 'people', 'feel', 'superior', 'laugh', 'most', 'pathetic', 'characters', 'ever', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen', 'only', 'likeable', 'character', 'whole', 'bunch', 'Deb', 'could', 'use', 'pointers', 'direction', 'pony', 'tail', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'not', 'side', 'film', 'map', 'clothing', 'styles', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'holdovers', 'polyester', 'butterfly', 'collar', '70s', 'interior', 'house', 'wood', 'panel', 'walls', 'top', 'loading', 'VCRs', 'also', 'put', 'family', 'league', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'school', 'dance', 'plays', 'classic', '80s', 'songs', 'yet', 'know', '1990s', 'Kip', 'Dynamite', 'surfing', 'Internet', 'babes.Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'unlikeable', 'nerd', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'friends', 'new', 'Mexican', 'kid', 'who', 'stereotypical', 'accent', 'Slow', 'Poke', 'Rodriguez', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'cartoons', 'cousin', 'Speedy', 'Gonzalez', 'Watching', 'film', 'as', 'painful', 'should', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'anyone', 'why', 'Napoleon', 'always', 'picked', 'school', 'friends', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'date', 'brother', 'Kip', 'better', 'hanging', 'out', 'home', 'job', 'getting', 'involved', 'salesman', 'schemes', 'when', 'used-car', 'salesman', 'looking', 'uncle', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'dreams', 'faded', 'high', 'school', 'glory', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'only', 'coach', 'put', 'game', 'last', 'quarter', 'final', 'game', 'senior', 'year', 'Napoleon', 'Kip', 'live', 'grandmother', 'who', 'movie', 'really', 'quick', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'be', 'losers', 'fend', 'cold', 'brutal', 'superficial', 'world.Does', 'movie', 'have', 'point', 'Not', 'really', 'only', 'consider', 'idea', 'director', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'indite', 'having', 'superiority', 'complexes', 'judging', 'laughing', 'patheticness', 'characters', 'lot', 'scenes', 'have', 'humor', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'going', 'really', 'well', 'Mormon', 'culture', 'Idaho', 'Utah', 'where', 'film', 'place', 'Preston', 'Idaho', 'director', 'graduate', 'BYU', 'censored', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'when', 'attended', 'there', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Mormon', 'specifications', 'morality', 'profanity', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'prohibition', 'bad', 'taste', 'otherwise', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'light', 'day.Having', 'said', 'not', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'would', 'be', 'Barton', 'Fink', 'only', 'film', 'ever', 'walked', 'theater', 'middle', 'loved', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'thought', 'was', 'most', 'creative', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'also', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'manipulative', 'choice', 'song', 'was', 'lyrically', 'brilliant', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'end', 'was', 'aggravating', 'film', 'consider', 'poor', 'taste', 'brilliant', 'note', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'were', 'two', 'other', 'points', 'where', 'director', 'used', 'two', 'time', 'favorite', '1980s', 'songs', 'Forever', 'Young', 'Alphaville', 'Time', 'Time', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'so', 'must', 'add', 'one', 'star', 'music', 'selection', 'film', 'also', 'liked', 'Llama', 'wished', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'LaFawnduh', 'Rex', 'bodybuilding', 'wife', 'So', 'characters', 'saved', 'film', 'being', 'complete', 'wash', 'thus', 'three', 'stars', 'instead', 'automatic', 'one', 'reviews']",Napoleon Dynamite

While most people will be praising the comedic side of this film, I was most impressed with the storyline and characters. This movie does have an obscure, rather odd plot. To quickly describe it, it's basically just a deep insight into the life of a nerd, that being the main character Napoleon Dynamite. Of course, from this unveils numerous side plots, the largest being Napoleon's friend running for Class President.I found the humour to be not filled wih hilarity, but quite suttle and witty. There are certain moments in the film that are especially funny, but no one stands out. The acting is strong, especially the lead role, and we get a great new style of comedy that few of us have ever seen before.Overall, this is a strong comedy, which is loved by most who see it.

628545,A1ZOYQ41EGZJ7D,B00005JNBQ,"Paul ""Pauli""","[1, 2]","This movie reminded me of a 5-star movie, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", because of the colorful characters, strange family situation, western location (ND takes place in Idaho) and even goofy name. It didn't have quite the acting caliber (although Jon Gries turns in a great performance as Napoleon's shady Uncle Rico), but a lot of creativity went into this story about those awkward teen years in a typical American High School.The first part of the movie introduces the characters and their ideosyncracies and is a bit slow-moving. I found it to be very funny and careful not to be too over-the-top, e.g., the antagonists (mainly Uncle Rico and the popular gang at school) aren't portrayed as being the personification of evil, just annoying to Napoleon and his friends who are potrayed as average, nerdy high school kids trying to survive. They've all developed worlds of their own in which terms they frequently express their thoughts, e.g., Napoleon talks about needing ""great skills"" to get dates with chicks and how his favorite animal is a ""liger"" which is one he himself invented.The second part of the movie is the making of the class Presidential candidate, Napoleon's friend Pedro, who is the most unlikely of candidates. Newly-arrived in town, about all Pedro has going for him is that he's the only guy with a mustache in school. He's up against Summer, the most popular girl in school played by Halley Duff, who seems to hold all the cards. While I refuse to give the outcome away, I will remark that Napoleon plays the biggest part in the wacky outcome of the election.I was a little bit confused as to when this was taking place. My wife, who watched it with me and also enjoyed the film, kept pointing out the 1980's styles and music which seemed to make sense, but Kip has a serious online, chat-room relationship with his girlfriend which is definitely post-1995. This doesn't detract from the film much - they played ""Time After Time"" at the dance, one of my favorite '80s duets.It's refreshing to see a movie which involves kids without a lot of extreme grossness or with the kids being engaged in any type of vice other than some bullying and insults. There are some extremely funny scenes involving feeding the pet llama, jumping bikes and drawing less than flattering pictures of the girl you want to date. All the characters in the sub-plots enjoy happy endings, including the notorious Uncle Rico - there's no nasty revenge which sets this film apart from a lot of goofy high school flicks.",4,"Great ""west of the Mississippi"" movie",1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,2519,"['movie', 'reminded', '5-star', 'movie', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'colorful', 'characters', 'strange', 'family', 'situation', 'western', 'location', 'ND', 'place', 'Idaho', 'even', 'goofy', 'name', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'acting', 'caliber', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'great', 'performance', 'Napoleon', 'shady', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'lot', 'creativity', 'went', 'story', 'awkward', 'teen', 'years', 'typical', 'American', 'High', 'School.The', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'characters', 'ideosyncracies', 'bit', 'slow-moving', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'careful', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'e.g.', 'antagonists', 'mainly', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'popular', 'gang', 'school', 'are', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'being', 'personification', 'evil', 'just', 'annoying', 'Napoleon', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'potrayed', 'average', 'nerdy', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'trying', 'survive', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'worlds', 'own', 'terms', 'frequently', 'express', 'thoughts', 'e.g.', 'Napoleon', 'talks', 'needing', 'great', 'skills', 'get', 'dates', 'chicks', 'how', 'favorite', 'animal', 'liger', 'one', 'invented.The', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'making', 'class', 'Presidential', 'candidate', 'Napoleon', 'friend', 'Pedro', 'who', 'most', 'unlikely', 'candidates', 'Newly-arrived', 'town', 'Pedro', 'going', 'only', 'guy', 'mustache', 'school', 'up', 'Summer', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'played', 'Halley', 'Duff', 'who', 'hold', 'cards', 'refuse', 'give', 'outcome', 'away', 'will', 'remark', 'Napoleon', 'biggest', 'part', 'wacky', 'outcome', 'election.I', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'confused', 'when', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'wife', 'who', 'watched', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'kept', 'pointing', 'out', '1980', 'styles', 'music', 'seemed', 'make', 'sense', 'Kip', 'serious', 'online', 'chat-room', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'definitely', 'post-1995', ""n't"", 'detract', 'film', 'much', 'played', 'Time', 'Time', 'dance', 'one', 'favorite', ""'80s"", 'duets.It', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'kids', 'lot', 'extreme', 'grossness', 'kids', 'being', 'engaged', 'type', 'vice', 'other', 'bullying', 'insults', 'are', 'extremely', 'funny', 'scenes', 'involving', 'feeding', 'pet', 'llama', 'jumping', 'bikes', 'drawing', 'less', 'flattering', 'pictures', 'girl', 'want', 'date', 'characters', 'sub-plots', 'enjoy', 'happy', 'endings', 'including', 'notorious', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'nasty', 'revenge', 'film', 'apart', 'lot', 'goofy', 'high', 'school', 'flicks']",Napoleon Dynamite

628550,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00005JNBQ,P Magnum,"[1, 6]","Napoleon Dynamite is one weird film.  You will find yourself laughing hysterically at times and completely bored at others.  There is no real plot to the film other than Napoleon's (Jon Heder) efforts to get his friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) elected class president.  Napoleon lives with grandmother and his effeminate brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  After grandma is hurt riding in the dunes, Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to watch after the boys even though Kip is 32.  While Napoleon is an outcast with no friends, Uncle Rico is the saddest character in the film.

628553,A2VN986E5KR1NV,B00005JNBQ,ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen),"[24, 27]","This winning little low key comedy knocked me out with its subtle brilliance.  Director Jared Hess and lead actor Jon Heder have wrought a minor miracle with this low budget, big box office film, which is so deadpan that some folks perhaps completely missed the point.Like the delightful Christopher Guest projects A MIGHTY WIND or WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, this film definitely spoofs and caracatures its main characters; yet, it maintains a lot of affection for them as well.  The mood and atmospherics of the small Idaho town are spot-on perfect...it could be Anytown USA or any school.  Heder's Napoleon is a nerd for the ages. but he's also a tough survivor who's integrity and uniqueness gives him a thick skinned determination that makes you cheer when he succeeds.Napoleon's one liners and dialog are the stuff of legends.  I love his explanation of the ""Liger,"" and his unmerited pride in his art skills.Jon Gries as Uncle Rico is the perfect blend of oily sleaze, rockheaded idiocy, and pointless arrogance...and off-kilter menace.  His routine of filming himself passing a football is so idiosyncratic and pitiful that it had me rolling on the floor. Aaron Ruell as Kip Dynamite seems to be based on John Waters, except more hip and less gross.  Ruell is hilariously brilliant in a supporting role; he seems almost hateful and cold (and even nerdier than Napoleon), until he meets the hot mama LaFawnduh Lucas, played with a lot of spice by Shondrella Avery.  By the end of the movie, Kip is actually almost lovable.Then, of course, there is Pedro, who is actually a very cool cat.  He is portrayed by Efran Ramirez with a winning, shy-but-confident demeanor; his deadpan delivery also provokes a lot of mirth.  The movie wouldn't be complete without the lovely Tina Majorino, who plays Deb, a friend to Pedro and love interest for Napoleon (once he finally sees the *babe* Summer Wheatley for what she really is...a selfish trollop).Napoleon's dance at the end of the film has to be seen to be believed--it's pure magic.  You will, like his high school classmates, want to stand and cheer.This DVD has some really cool extras, including commentary and a short film.  The music in the movie is totally cool and enjoyable.  I believe NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a work of genius...a bit raw and unfocused at points, but a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging visionary work.  The acting and directing are inspired.One other note: this is a very clean movie and acceptable for family viewing.  It's proof that creativity wins out over gratuitous nudity and profanity and violence any day.",5,Vote for Pedro,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,2582,"['winning', 'little', 'low', 'key', 'comedy', 'knocked', 'out', 'subtle', 'brilliance', 'Director', 'Jared', 'Hess', 'lead', 'actor', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'have', 'wrought', 'minor', 'miracle', 'low', 'budget', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'film', 'so', 'deadpan', 'folks', 'perhaps', 'completely', 'missed', 'point.Like', 'delightful', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'projects', 'A', 'MIGHTY', 'WIND', 'WAITING', 'FOR', 'GUFFMAN', 'film', 'definitely', 'spoofs', 'main', 'characters', 'yet', 'lot', 'affection', 'as', 'well', 'mood', 'atmospherics', 'small', 'Idaho', 'town', 'are', 'spot-on', 'perfect', 'could', 'be', 'Anytown', 'USA', 'school', 'Heder', 'Napoleon', 'nerd', 'ages', 'also', 'tough', 'survivor', 'who', 'integrity', 'uniqueness', 'thick', 'skinned', 'determination', 'cheer', 'when', 'succeeds.Napoleon', 'one', 'liners', 'dialog', 'are', 'stuff', 'legends', 'love', 'explanation', 'Liger', 'unmerited', 'pride', 'art', 'skills.Jon', 'Gries', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'perfect', 'blend', 'oily', 'sleaze', 'rockheaded', 'idiocy', 'pointless', 'arrogance', 'off-kilter', 'menace', 'routine', 'filming', 'passing', 'football', 'so', 'idiosyncratic', 'pitiful', 'had', 'rolling', 'floor', 'Aaron', 'Ruell', 'Kip', 'Dynamite', 'be', 'based', 'John', 'Waters', 'more', 'hip', 'less', 'gross', 'Ruell', 'hilariously', 'brilliant', 'supporting', 'role', 'almost', 'hateful', 'cold', 'even', 'nerdier', 'Napoleon', 'hot', 'mama', 'LaFawnduh', 'Lucas', 'played', 'lot', 'spice', 'Shondrella', 'Avery', 'end', 'movie', 'Kip', 'actually', 'almost', 'lovable.Then', 'course', 'Pedro', 'who', 'actually', 'very', 'cool', 'cat', 'portrayed', 'Efran', 'Ramirez', 'winning', 'shy-but-confident', 'demeanor', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'also', 'lot', 'mirth', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'complete', 'lovely', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'who', 'Deb', 'friend', 'Pedro', 'love', 'interest', 'Napoleon', 'once', 'finally', '*babe*', 'Summer', 'Wheatley', 'what', 'really', 'selfish', 'trollop', '.Napoleon', 'dance', 'end', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'pure', 'magic', 'will', 'high', 'school', 'classmates', 'want', 'stand', 'cheer.This', 'DVD', 'really', 'cool', 'extras', 'including', 'commentary', 'short', 'film', 'music', 'movie', 'totally', 'cool', 'enjoyable', 'believe', 'NAPOLEON', 'DYNAMITE', 'work', 'genius', 'bit', 'raw', 'unfocused', 'points', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'engaging', 'visionary', 'work', 'acting', 'directing', 'are', 'inspired.One', 'other', 'note', 'very', 'clean', 'movie', 'acceptable', 'family', 'viewing', 'proof', 'creativity', 'out', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'violence', 'day']",Napoleon Dynamite
628554,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B00005JNBQ,Publius,"[3, 8]","Napoleon Dynamite is one of the more interesting movies to be made in the last decade.  It is also a good representation of the newly fashinoned post modern hero.  Napoleon floats through life without any motivation whatsoever.  He takes pleasure in the small things in life like `chapstick' and drawing fantasy cartoon characters.  The screenwriter could have organized the plot around a long protracted battle between the nerds and the cool people.  Instead, nobody in this movie seems to care about who wins or loses this battle.  Except for the `Vote for Pedro' campaign, we are left with the notion that the `nerds' and the `dorks' are happy with their lot in high school life.  In fact, we are left to believe that Napoleon's involvement in Pedro's campaign is only to serve as Pedro's bodyguard.  So although Napoleon is focused, his focus is detached.  Uncle Rico, on the other hand, has an undetached focus in his life.  Unfortunately, his focus is on the year 1982 when his football team played in the State championship.  While Uncle Rico concentrates on the past, and Napoleon arguably concentrates on nothing, Kip is the only one that focuses on the future with his relationship and eventual marriage to LaFawnduh.  It seems Kip is the only one to break out of the family's monotonous existence.  The movie is also very family friendly.  There is no violence, no gratuitous sexual innuendos and no drugs.  Hardly the usual fare of the 18-25 year old cohort which has taken to this movie.  (An age group that may be responsible for the ubiquity of the Vote for Pedro T-Shirts)  With the momentum that this movie has gained, it may be considered the first cult classic of the 00's, even though the community in the film seems to be trapped in the 1980's.",4,Post Modern Hero,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,1765,"['Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'movies', 'be', 'made', 'last', 'decade', 'also', 'good', 'representation', 'newly', 'fashinoned', 'post', 'modern', 'hero', 'Napoleon', 'floats', 'life', 'motivation', 'whatsoever', 'pleasure', 'small', 'things', 'life', 'chapstick', 'drawing', 'fantasy', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'screenwriter', 'could', 'have', 'organized', 'plot', 'long', 'protracted', 'battle', 'nerds', 'cool', 'people', 'Instead', 'nobody', 'movie', 'care', 'who', 'battle', 'Vote', 'Pedro', 'campaign', 'are', 'left', 'notion', 'nerds', 'dorks', 'are', 'happy', 'lot', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'fact', 'are', 'left', 'believe', 'Napoleon', 'involvement', 'Pedro', 'campaign', 'only', 'serve', 'Pedro', 'bodyguard', 'Napoleon', 'focused', 'focus', 'detached', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'other', 'hand', 'undetached', 'focus', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'focus', 'year', '1982', 'when', 'football', 'team', 'played', 'State', 'championship', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'past', 'Napoleon', 'arguably', 'nothing', 'Kip', 'only', 'one', 'future', 'relationship', 'eventual', 'marriage', 'LaFawnduh', 'Kip', 'only', 'one', 'break', 'family', 'monotonous', 'existence', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'family', 'friendly', 'violence', 'gratuitous', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'drugs', 'Hardly', 'usual', 'fare', '18-25', 'year', 'old', 'cohort', 'taken', 'movie', 'age', 'group', 'may', 'be', 'responsible', 'ubiquity', 'Vote', 'Pedro', 'T-Shirts', 'momentum', 'movie', 'gained', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'first', 'cult', 'classic', '00', 'even', 'community', 'film', 'be', 'trapped', '1980']",Napoleon Dynamite

628577,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JNBQ,RMurray847,"[13, 16]","Here's a review from a 41 year old man.  I've read lots of reviews of this movie that absolutely trash it. And obviously, it's become quite a ""cult"" hit amongst a younger crowd.  In fact, it was my 17 year old son who insisted my wife and I see it.  And we immediately loved it, from the delightful opening credits to Napolean's first line ""Whatever I want to!  Gosh!!""The critics who have trashed it frequently say that it makes fun of its characters...that it condescends to them. I'm surprised at that attitude.  In so many movies, oh, let's cite ""Revenge of the Nerds"" as an architypical example, the ""nerds"" are losers who aren't really.  They're just different from the jocks or the ""beautiful people,"" but by the end, they've changed, become winners and made fools of the bad guys. Everyone learns a lesson.The fact is, these movies are untruthful, however ""uplifting"" they may be.  We all know that in life, there ARE ""losers.""  People with not a whole lot to offer the world in general.  Napolean and his family and friends ARE losers. And Napolean KNOWS it. He doesn't seem to dream of being accepted. His ambitions (to draw, to be a martial artist / bow staff wielder, etc.) are things he is deluded about, but he seems to know it.The movie isn't about how Napolean rises from the lower depths to become some sort of hero. Essentially, we see him pull himself up by his own moonboot-straps, primarily to take a few steps into to a world where he connects with people.  He's not about taking on society or arguing that he's ""different but just as worthy"", as the NERDS movies would.When his brother Kip takes him to a Tae Kwon Do class, Napolean is inspired by the ridiculous owner's words, ""Everyone needs a buddy, no more flying solo.""  He goes out and makes friends with the friendless Pedro, and says to him, ""We're pretty much buddies now, right?  So you've got my back and stuff, right?""  Napolean just wants someone to have his back and vice-versa.Later in the movie, Napolean shows his character when he gets Pedro's back by providing entertainment during the school elections.  I won't say more, except to say that Napolean's bravery and reluctance are palpable in the hilarious and touching scene.And what about his ""enemies?""  There is one jock who beats up on Napolean for no good reason, and this guy never really gets a comeuppance.  This guy doesn't get any support from others at school,either, and we certainly know that this ""jock"" is a loser too.Part of this comes from the fact that the movie is set in a small town in an ""obscure"" state (Idaho), that appears to offer few prospects to anyone.  No one dreams of going to Hollywood or becoming a star or a computer whiz, doctor, etc. etc.  There aren't any dreams. (Although, to Napolean and Pedro's credit, they seem to have quite a knack at agriculture...which may be what lays in their future; Deb is a natural entrepreneur.)Napolean, basically, is a loser comfortable in his own skin, and beneath his sullenness, is...a sullen teenager.  He's a pain in the neck sometimes, but through his modest strength of character, he makes a close friend, and takes tentative (and VERY sweetly convincing) steps towards a first romance.  But only tentative...the final shot of him playing tether ball with his female friend tells us all we need to know about how ready he may or may not be for love.Also, this is a rare movie that shows people who don't have a lot of money.  The lack of money is dealt with constantly (they can't afford martial arts lessons, an extra car, a new suit, etc.) This is very refreshing, because in most movies dealing with teens, most of the kids (winners and losers alike) aren't exactly hurting for money.The movie is packed with indelible characters (each more self-deluded than the next) and gentle affirmations of how there is someone for everyone...even Napolean's more hapless brother Kip. It's also very funny (Napolean teaching himself to dance, the farmer shooting his cow, the llama, Uncle Rico's almost pathological desire to travel back in time, etc.)I don't know why this movie connects to today's teens. I'm not a teen, afterall.  But I sure see teens I know in Napolean.  His bursts of ""Idiot!"" ring quite true.  But I appreciate the quiet, unexpected heart of the movie, and I believe the filmmakers aren't poking fun at these characters...they are just staying true to who they are.  I also appreciate that the film is PG rated and doesn't need to show teens all obsessed with sex, drugs, inappropriate music, etc.  They probably are, but the filmmakers aren't interested in examining the usual...they're shedding a little light in humerous corners we don't usually look.This is a funny and touching film.

Astounding.This film is presented in BOTH widescreen(1:85:1) and fullscreen versions,which means they have put it on a dreaded two sided disc.There are special features like a making of featurette,an extended video of the wedding,a short film ``Pelica``,deleted scenes,commentary and stills gallery.The transfer is well done and is clear and crisp.All in all a winner of a film.A more weird and quirky film you will be hard pressed to find but it works wonderfully on many levels.Don`t anaylze it too much,just hang on and enjoy the flippin`ride.Recommended.",4,Wierd or what?...but it works!,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,3275,"['movie', 'can', 'say', 'certainly', 'not', 'THE', 'most', 'quirkiest', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen/reviewed.Released', 'January/04', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'nerd', 'supreme.His', 'world', 'populated', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'extreme', 'downtrodden', ""we-don't-fit-in"", 'types', 'popular', 'people', 'bullies.The', 'plot', 'turned', 'sideways', 'would', 'disappear', 'as', 'quirky', 'characters', 'populate', 'it.The', 'story', 'place', 'rural', 'Preston', 'Idaho', 'early', '90s', 'Dynamite', 'family', 'house', 'decor', 'suggest', 'definite', '70s', 'kiche.Napolean', 'brother', 'Kip', 'Aaron', 'Ruell', 'live', 'grandmother', 'Sandy', 'Martin', 'most', 'definitely', 'butch', 'day', 'granny', 'boys', 'going', 'out', 'date', 'up', 'hospital', 'spell', 'injuring', 'riding', 'ATV', 'particularly', 'large', 'desert', 'dune.Coming', 'baby', 'sitting', 'rescue', 'uncle', 'Rico', 'John', 'Gries', 'who', 'old', 'should', ""'ve"", ""could've-longing"", 'high', 'school', 'days.As', 'Napoleon', 'plods', 'along', 'school', 'Kip', 'who', 'front', 'computer', 'screen', 'day', 'persuaded', 'forgo', 'internet', 'chatting/surfing', 'long', 'enough', 'help', 'uncle', 'make', 'little', 'bread.Meanwhile', 'school', 'Napolean', 'befriended', 'Mexican', 'student', 'name', 'Pedro', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', '.The', 'first', 'big', 'challenge', 'picking', 'getting', 'someone', 'take', 'prom.The', 'next', 'one', 'Pedro', 's', 'desire', 'become', 'student', 'president.Pedro', 'up', 'taking', 'girl', 'Napolean', 'kind', 'had', 'eye', 'dance', 'end', 'Pedro', 'actually', 'presidency.As', 'movie', 'close', 'Grandma', 'returned', 'Kip', 'met', 'someone', 'chat', 'room', 'who', 'soul', 'mate', 'girl', 'Napolean', 'likes', 'Deb', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'up', 'Nappy', 'play', 'tether', 'post', 'credit', 'sequence', 'Kip', 'soul', 'mate', 'Lafawnduh', 'Shondrella', 'Avery', 'get', 'married', 'lateto', 'wedding', 'Napolean', 'up', 'just', 'tamed', 'wild', 'horse', 'bride', 'groom', 'who', 'ride', 'off', 'Napolean', 'heard', 'utter', 'lucky', '.As', 'said', 'just', 'enough', 'plot', 'give', 'characters', 'here', 'impetus', 'go', 'one', 'situation', 'it.But', 'everyone', 'soooo', 'pay', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'where', 'going', 'enjoying', 'ride', 'itself.Napolean', 'star', 'character', 'be', '11', 'year', 'old', 'wrapped', 'up', 'teenager', 's', 'body.His', 'eyes', 'rarely', 'make', 'contact', 'anyone', 'flippin', 'alot', 'when', 'frustrated', 'deep', 'guttural', 'sigh.His', 'run', 'loping', 'gait', 'creatures', 'original', 'Invaders', 'Mars', 'just', 'hilarious', 'quirky', 'character', 'trait', 'many', 'character', 'movie', 'viewer.This', 'movie', 'made', 'paltry', '400,000', 'made', '46,000,000', 'Astounding.This', 'film', 'presented', 'BOTH', 'widescreen', '1:85:1', 'fullscreen', 'versions', 'have', 'put', 'dreaded', 'two', 'sided', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'making', 'featurette', 'extended', 'video', 'wedding', 'short', 'film', 'Pelica', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'gallery.The', 'transfer', 'well', 'done', 'clear', 'crisp.All', 'winner', 'film.A', 'more', 'weird', 'quirky', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'wonderfully', 'many', 'levels.Don', 't', 'anaylze', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'hang', 'enjoy', 'flippin', 'ride.Recommended']",Napoleon Dynamite

Murena Jr. ""tedmurena""","[4, 4]","Possibly the best High-School Loser movie ever made, Napoleon Dynamite is a film that you will either love or hate but if you are willing to see through some of the silliness of the plot you will see that this is a movie about connecting with your reality whatever that may be. All of the main characters of this film are highly out of touch with mainstream society and even out of touch with themselves.  In a word they are all loners.  As a wise person once told me ""friends keep you sane"" and these people, without friends, are insane.  Living in the past, online, in another culture or just in some other dimension, they all are living lives that aren't checked by the world that goes on around them. This makes conversation, even between each other, disjointed.  Lost, somehow they come together and eventually Napoleon gets a few friends and begins to connect to some sense of reality. Napoleon's moment of revelation comes when he says ""I dont have any skills. Girls only want to go out with guys who have skills... Ninja Skills, Numchuck skills"" ... etc. Here his friend Pedro finally connects with him saying he has drawing skills (which he barely has) and Napoleon begins to have some sense of direction. The setting of the movie is somewhat absurd.  It is set in rural/suburban Idaho with all of its dreary depressingly out of date architecture, which lends itself well to the out of touch feeling the film seeks to develop.Is the movie believable? No.  Is the Movie thoroughly enjoyable? Yes.So why is this possibly the best high-school movie?  The answer is simple:  everyone feels out of touch to a certain degree in high school.  This movie portrays that vividly and humorously.  It isn't the run-of-the-mill cool people - vs. loser film but a film about individuals against the world.  Seeing the film as something other than a lame joke is key to its enjoyment but is certainly a good film for mixed audiences and anyone who has ever felt out of place... maybe even you.Ted Murena",4,A Movie for Anyone who's ever Felt out of Place.

Jon Heder is wonderful as Napoleon, a Preston, Idaho, high schooler coping with the mundane day to day problems of family, friends, and school.  But mostly it's the terminal boredom and growing anger of Napoleon's woefully unfulfilling circumstances that drive the quirky and weirdly charming story.  Listening to the straightforward commentary by Heder and screenwriter-director Jared Hess, it becomes clear that there's apparently little intended irony in the fact based events that make up this slightly twisted tale of not coming of age.

628590,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JNBQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 11]","Napoleon Dynamite is a king among nerds, a slack-jawed, mouth-breathing high school student who suffers the slings and arrows of perpetual ridicule, yet who gives as good as he gets when the treatment gets too rough.  Luckily, Napoleon is far from alone in his nerddom. He has an older brother who wears buttoned-up short sleeve dress shirts and black-rimmed glasses, and whose social contact is limited mainly to people he meets in internet chat rooms.  Napoleon's Uncle Rick is what might be called a ""muscular nerd,"" a used-up, middle aged football player who dreams of his glory days in 1982 when he was just one play away from a career in the NFL and a life of fame and fortune, and who now spends his time hawking Tupperware products, selling miracle breast enhancement devices, and investing in time travel machines he finds in catalogues.  Napoleon also befriends the school's newest nerd, a transfer student named Pedro, and tries to start up a romance with the shy and awkward Deb, who sheepishly goes door to door drumming up business for her studio that specializes in ""glamour"" photo shots for a decidedly unglamorous clientele.Set in a small town in rural Idaho, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a quirky regional comedy that achieved phenomenal mainstream success at the American box office.  Its appeal is in its low-keyed, understated look at a group of people that more of us probably identify with than we would like to acknowledge.  This is a movie for anyone who has ever felt unattractive or unpopular, who just never quite ""fit in"" with the people who really counted, especially in those dark ages known as the ""teen years.""  One can't help liking and rooting for these bizarre and eccentric individuals who are really just looking for the same love and acceptance that we all are.Director Jared Hess, along with co-writer Jerusha Hess, never feels the need to exaggerate or overstate the comedy.  It would have been easy for them to have turned this into another ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" placing their characters in over-the-top predicaments and situations to appease audience expectations.  Instead, they let the story develop subtly and gradually, making the film feel more attuned to real life in the process.  It may seem like a contradiction in terms, but the writers achieve their humor through a kind of understated hyperbole that allows us to laugh with the characters rather than at them.  These nerds may be nerds to the core, but they reflect the longings and doubts common to all of us at one time or another.  As a result, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is warm and humanistic where it could easily have been cruel and condescending.The filmmakers are helped immeasurably by a wonderfully talented cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly.  Joe Heder as Napoleon, Aaron Ruell as his brother, Kip, Efren Ramirez as Pedro, and Tina Majorino as Deb all deliver their lines in a flat, emotionless, singsong monotone that perfectly captures the defense mechanism each of them has set up as a shield against a brutal, uncomprehending world.  Yet, Napoleon and his fellow nerds never settle for victim status, as each finds a way to assert his individuality and carve out a little piece of happiness for himself.  As an actor, only Jon Gries as Napoleon's Uncle Rico gets to break through the somnambulist haze and go for the fences in his delivery.""Napoleon Dynamite"" is clearly not the kind of movie that every audience will appreciate, but those movie watchers with a taste for the offbeat and quirky will have a fun time with it.",4,"The real ""Revenge of the Nerds""",1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,3545,"['Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'king', 'nerds', 'slack-jawed', 'mouth-breathing', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'slings', 'arrows', 'perpetual', 'ridicule', 'who', 'as', 'good', 'when', 'treatment', 'too', 'rough', 'Luckily', 'Napoleon', 'far', 'alone', 'nerddom', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'buttoned-up', 'short', 'sleeve', 'dress', 'shirts', 'black-rimmed', 'glasses', 'social', 'contact', 'limited', 'mainly', 'people', 'internet', 'chat', 'rooms', 'Napoleon', 'Uncle', 'Rick', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'muscular', 'nerd', 'used-up', 'middle', 'aged', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'glory', 'days', '1982', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'play', 'away', 'career', 'NFL', 'life', 'fame', 'fortune', 'who', 'now', 'time', 'hawking', 'Tupperware', 'products', 'selling', 'miracle', 'breast', 'enhancement', 'devices', 'investing', 'time', 'travel', 'machines', 'catalogues', 'Napoleon', 'also', 'school', 'newest', 'nerd', 'transfer', 'student', 'named', 'Pedro', 'tries', 'start', 'up', 'romance', 'shy', 'awkward', 'Deb', 'who', 'sheepishly', 'door', 'door', 'drumming', 'up', 'business', 'studio', 'glamour', 'photo', 'shots', 'decidedly', 'unglamorous', 'clientele.Set', 'small', 'town', 'rural', 'Idaho', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'quirky', 'regional', 'comedy', 'achieved', 'phenomenal', 'mainstream', 'success', 'American', 'box', 'office', 'appeal', 'low-keyed', 'understated', 'look', 'group', 'people', 'more', 'probably', 'would', 'like', 'acknowledge', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'unattractive', 'unpopular', 'who', 'just', 'never', 'quite', 'fit', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'counted', 'especially', 'dark', 'ages', 'known', 'teen', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'rooting', 'bizarre', 'eccentric', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'looking', 'same', 'love', 'acceptance', 'are.Director', 'Jared', 'Hess', 'co-writer', 'Jerusha', 'Hess', 'never', 'need', 'exaggerate', 'overstate', 'comedy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'have', 'turned', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'placing', 'characters', 'over-the-top', 'predicaments', 'situations', 'appease', 'audience', 'expectations', 'Instead', 'let', 'story', 'develop', 'subtly', 'gradually', 'making', 'film', 'feel', 'more', 'attuned', 'real', 'life', 'process', 'may', 'seem', 'contradiction', 'terms', 'writers', 'achieve', 'humor', 'kind', 'understated', 'hyperbole', 'laugh', 'characters', 'rather', 'nerds', 'may', 'be', 'nerds', 'core', 'reflect', 'longings', 'doubts', 'common', 'one', 'time', 'result', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'warm', 'humanistic', 'where', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'cruel', 'condescending.The', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'helped', 'immeasurably', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'cast', 'whom', 'play', 'parts', 'perfectly', 'Joe', 'Heder', 'Napoleon', 'Aaron', 'Ruell', 'brother', 'Kip', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'Pedro', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'Deb', 'deliver', 'lines', 'flat', 'emotionless', 'singsong', 'monotone', 'perfectly', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'set', 'up', 'shield', 'brutal', 'uncomprehending', 'world', 'Napoleon', 'fellow', 'nerds', 'never', 'settle', 'victim', 'status', 'way', 'assert', 'individuality', 'carve', 'out', 'little', 'piece', 'happiness', 'actor', 'only', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'Napoleon', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'break', 'somnambulist', 'haze', 'go', 'fences', 'delivery', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'clearly', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'audience', 'will', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'watchers', 'taste', 'offbeat', 'quirky', 'will', 'have', 'fun', 'time']",Napoleon Dynamite

After ten minutes, she said, ""What is it that you find remotely funny about this?""  Reading the reviews here, I'm equally puzzled why some people hate what I consider to be a masterpiece.A movie gets to create its own universe.  That universe must be internally consistent, and follow its own rules.  Napoleon dynamite does this well, creating an entirely unique universe with no Hollywood cliches, no tear-jerking stereotypical themes.  For some people, that could mean that it lacks the signposts with which they are familiar, the action or the jokes or the themes that make something entertainment.By refusing to adopt those stereotypes, the movie hits the viewer as a refreshing dose of reality.  Movie reality is usually a carefully woven script of lines that fit nicely together.  Napolean Dynamite is not.  It reminded me of all those times I felt out of place or alienated in high school, unable to say anything intelligent.People who like the movie, I believe, have a taste for the unique and for the artistic, as opposed to the merely entertaining.

628595,AGSWTH7SP2256,B00005JNBQ,R. W. Rasband,"[66, 77]","For the past few years there has been a movement in American film you could call ""The New Mormon Cinema.""  Young Latter-day Saint filmmakers (definitely inspired by the Sundance Film Festival which is held right in their own backyard) have been making inexpensive independent films that are targeted at the Mormon population that stretches in the west from Alberta in Canada down past the Mexican border (the so-called ""Mormon Corridor."")  Most of these movies have been really bad, cheaply done sit-com influenced ""comedies"" that have had absolutely no influence on non-Mormon audiences.  (With the honorable exeception of Richard Dutcher, the director of good movies like the missionary drama ""God's Army"" and the thriller ""Brigham City."")  Things began to change this year with widespread recognition going to the tough-minded World War II drama ""Saints and Soldiers"" and this twisted little comic  masterpiece, ""Napoleon Dynamite.""Jared and Jerusha Hess are products of Brigham Young University's film school and they made ND with a bunch of their friends.  The unspoken assumption of this film is that most of the kids are Mormons.  Some critics who misunderstood the movie as ""condescending"" have no experience with real people like these.  I live in rural Utah and I can testify that Hess is only mildly exaggerating.  The critics somehow miss the love with which the characters are drawn, just as some Minnesotans weren't too thrilled with the Coen brothers' ""Fargo.""  Napoleon's pathetic older brother Kip has been singled out as particularly unbelievable.  But believe me, Kips are a dime a dozen in Idaho (and Utah, too.)Napoleon himself is not so much acted as incarnated by Jon Heder, who would win some sort of Oscar if people could only see he was playing a role, not living it.  Napoleon is the real nerd deal, not some idealized John-Hughes-style Hollywood version.  You really feel the anguish of his life, even as it provokes guilty belly laughs.  The genius of the movie is how the Hesses take the angst of Todd Solondz (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Happiness"") and put their triumphantly uniquely Mormon spin on it.Hess is the second Mormon director, after Neil LaBute in ""The Shape of Things"", to make reference to singer Elvis Costello (""Napoleon Dynamite"" is one of Costello's aliases.)  The movie Napoleon is as physically unprepossessing as Costello is, until he starts to sing.  You see, Mormons are always worrying about what other people think of them, because of their long-time outsider status in American society.  This overwhelming self-consciousness can make them feel as awkward and crushed by the culture as Napoleon is.  But inside they just know they are as dynamic as the very name ""Napoleon Dynamite.""  The opportunity awaits for them to strut their true stuff.  An individual like Napoleon can't be destroyed if he doesn't want to be.  There's something eternal in him that will win out.  The importance of this thought is why the Hesses avoid the very appearance of sentimentality in their presentation of Napoleon.  You have to learn to love him in spite of his monstrous imperfections, because he is human.  And you rejoice in Napoleon's final dance, which is five or six of the most joyous minutes in a movie this year.It's also important that Kip and Napoleon redeem themselves by reaching out to others not like them.  Kip hilariously to La Fawnduh, and Napoleon to Pedro and Deb.  The Hesses are brave enough to make sympathetic jokes about multiculturalism here.  Certainly, Preston Idaho, won't save them; but maybe Detroit and Mexico will.  I left ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with genuinely earned good feelings about humanity in general and the future of Mormon movies in particular.",5,The New Mormon Cinema Finds Its Poster Boy,1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,3730,"['past', 'few', 'years', 'there', 'been', 'movement', 'American', 'film', 'could', 'call', 'New', 'Mormon', 'Cinema', 'Latter-day', 'Saint', 'filmmakers', 'definitely', 'inspired', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'held', 'right', 'own', 'backyard', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'inexpensive', 'independent', 'films', 'are', 'targeted', 'Mormon', 'population', 'west', 'Alberta', 'Canada', 'down', 'past', 'Mexican', 'border', 'so-called', 'Mormon', 'Corridor', 'Most', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'bad', 'cheaply', 'done', 'sit-com', 'influenced', 'comedies', 'have', 'had', 'absolutely', 'influence', 'non-Mormon', 'audiences', 'honorable', 'exeception', 'Richard', 'Dutcher', 'director', 'good', 'movies', 'missionary', 'drama', 'God', 'Army', 'thriller', 'Brigham', 'City', 'began', 'change', 'year', 'widespread', 'recognition', 'going', 'tough-minded', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'drama', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'twisted', 'little', 'comic', 'masterpiece', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Jared', 'Jerusha', 'Hess', 'are', 'products', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'University', 'film', 'school', 'made', 'ND', 'bunch', 'friends', 'unspoken', 'assumption', 'film', 'most', 'kids', 'are', 'Mormons', 'critics', 'who', 'misunderstood', 'movie', 'condescending', 'have', 'experience', 'real', 'people', 'live', 'rural', 'Utah', 'can', 'testify', 'Hess', 'only', 'mildly', 'exaggerating', 'critics', 'somehow', 'miss', 'love', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'just', 'Minnesotans', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'Fargo', 'Napoleon', 'pathetic', 'older', 'brother', 'Kip', 'been', 'singled', 'out', 'particularly', 'unbelievable', 'believe', 'Kips', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'Idaho', 'Utah', 'too', 'Napoleon', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'acted', 'incarnated', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'who', 'would', 'win', 'sort', 'Oscar', 'people', 'could', 'only', 'see', 'was', 'playing', 'role', 'not', 'living', 'Napoleon', 'real', 'nerd', 'deal', 'not', 'idealized', 'John-Hughes-style', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'really', 'feel', 'anguish', 'life', 'even', 'guilty', 'belly', 'genius', 'movie', 'how', 'Hesses', 'take', 'angst', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'Happiness', 'put', 'triumphantly', 'uniquely', 'Mormon', 'spin', 'it.Hess', 'second', 'Mormon', 'director', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'Shape', 'Things', 'make', 'reference', 'singer', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'one', 'Costello', 'aliases', 'movie', 'Napoleon', 'physically', 'unprepossessing', 'Costello', 'sing', 'see', 'Mormons', 'are', 'always', 'worrying', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'long-time', 'outsider', 'status', 'American', 'society', 'overwhelming', 'self-consciousness', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'awkward', 'crushed', 'culture', 'Napoleon', 'just', 'know', 'are', 'as', 'dynamic', 'very', 'name', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'opportunity', 'strut', 'true', 'stuff', 'individual', 'Napoleon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'destroyed', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'something', 'eternal', 'will', 'win', 'out', 'importance', 'thought', 'why', 'Hesses', 'avoid', 'very', 'appearance', 'sentimentality', 'presentation', 'Napoleon', 'have', 'learn', 'love', 'spite', 'monstrous', 'imperfections', 'human', 'rejoice', 'Napoleon', 'final', 'dance', 'five', 'six', 'most', 'joyous', 'minutes', 'movie', 'year.It', 'also', 'important', 'Kip', 'Napoleon', 'redeem', 'reaching', 'out', 'others', 'not', 'Kip', 'hilariously', 'La', 'Fawnduh', 'Napoleon', 'Pedro', 'Deb', 'Hesses', 'are', 'brave', 'enough', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'jokes', 'multiculturalism', 'here', 'Certainly', 'Preston', 'Idaho', 'wo', ""n't"", 'save', 'maybe', 'Detroit', 'Mexico', 'will', 'left', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'genuinely', 'earned', 'good', 'feelings', 'humanity', 'general', 'future', 'Mormon', 'movies', 'particular']",Napoleon Dynamite

628599,A31ZVXSLVHLLCN,B00005JNBQ,"S. A. Johnson ""misterscooter""","[3, 4]","4.0 to 4.5 stars.I have a hard time giving out 5 stars to a movie because that means the movie pretty much achieved perfection, whether to me personally or in the grand scheme of moviedom.  However, I do think that the makers of Napoleon Dynamite had goals in mind with this movie and I think they achieved those goals in making a very entertaining movie.  For a lot of people, acheiving your set goals can mean perfection.  For reaching those goals, I think it means they put out a darn good movie.This is definitely a character driven, as opposed to a plot driven, movie.  The characters and the actors that play them stand out and make the scenes memorable.  None of the characters seem to be like anyone I know, yet I can see a lot myself and others throughout bits and pieces of everyone.  Maybe that makes it hard to specifically identify with them but I did like that even the ""mean kids"" weren't as mean as Hollywood likes to make the bully.  And the ""good kids"" weren't as pure and infallible on the other end.  And because the extremes aren't so far apart, it doesn't put characters far out of reach for us, in spite of their quirkiness.The script is simple but well written and although there really aren't any punchlines, the ""jokes"" are buried in layers and require multiple viewings to catch them all, whether they are spoken or visual.  And the movie provides plenty of lines that are quotable in everyday life without being filled with innuendo or questionable language.Finally, I have a theory about this movie.  Most of the characters are in High School, but are really stuck at the stage of life they were in during 5th grade.  Whether it is what they eat at lunch (tater tots), the things they are into (bikes, not cars), the drawings, the ninja stars, etc., I see myself at age 11.  Maybe this isn't even the filmmakers intention, but look at them with this point of view and see if you enjoy the movie even more.In all, they have pulled off making a film that appeals to a wide range of ages.  It isn't for everybody, like any film, but it has broad appeal for a lot of viewers.",4,"A Fun, Easily Quotable Movie (With 5th Grade Theory??)",1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,2100,"['4.0', '4.5', 'stars.I', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'giving', 'out', '5', 'stars', 'movie', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'achieved', 'perfection', 'personally', 'grand', 'scheme', 'moviedom', 'However', 'do', 'think', 'makers', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'had', 'goals', 'mind', 'movie', 'think', 'achieved', 'goals', 'making', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'lot', 'people', 'acheiving', 'set', 'goals', 'can', 'mean', 'perfection', 'reaching', 'goals', 'think', 'put', 'out', 'darn', 'good', 'movie.This', 'definitely', 'character', 'driven', 'opposed', 'plot', 'driven', 'movie', 'characters', 'actors', 'play', 'stand', 'out', 'make', 'scenes', 'memorable', 'None', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'anyone', 'know', 'yet', 'can', 'see', 'lot', 'others', 'bits', 'pieces', 'everyone', 'Maybe', 'hard', 'specifically', 'identify', 'did', 'even', 'mean', 'kids', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'mean', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'bully', 'good', 'kids', 'were', ""n't"", 'pure', 'infallible', 'other', 'end', 'extremes', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'far', 'apart', ""n't"", 'put', 'characters', 'far', 'reach', 'spite', 'quirkiness.The', 'script', 'simple', 'well', 'written', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'punchlines', 'jokes', 'are', 'buried', 'layers', 'require', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'catch', 'are', 'spoken', 'visual', 'movie', 'plenty', 'lines', 'are', 'quotable', 'everyday', 'life', 'being', 'filled', 'innuendo', 'questionable', 'language.Finally', 'have', 'theory', 'movie', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'High', 'School', 'are', 'really', 'stuck', 'stage', 'life', 'were', '5th', 'grade', 'what', 'eat', 'lunch', 'tater', 'tots', 'things', 'are', 'bikes', 'not', 'cars', 'drawings', 'ninja', 'stars', 'etc.', 'see', 'age', '11', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'even', 'filmmakers', 'intention', 'look', 'point', 'view', 'see', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'even', 'more.In', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'making', 'film', 'appeals', 'wide', 'range', 'ages', ""n't"", 'everybody', 'film', 'broad', 'appeal', 'lot', 'viewers']",Napoleon Dynamite

WOW. wicked cool. Funny, interesting, insightful.My son, the Marine, over in Iraq, he loves this movie, and I must agree. This is something! Don't you just get tired of the run of the mill, cranked out Hollywood spatter, that we are suppose to rave over, even if we know in our hearts that it's not that great?Well, then, this is a breath of fresh air!The kid, Napoleon, played by Jon Heder, is about as ugly a kid as you'll ever meet. Not terribley bright either. But, there is something loveable about him. Maybe it's the ""Me"" in him. He is me, he is you, he represents all of our insecurities, faults, dreams that go unfulfilled. We all blunder, we all blow it, we all have dreams that get poo pooed by a family member or friend. We pretend that it doesn't bother us. but, I think it does.Napoleon embodies all our fears and hopes. that is what makes him so special. His idiot-ness is out, in plane sight,  for all to see. we laugh, but we FEEL him, and FEEL his pain. His family, brother, and uncle, are an extension of his painful dumb-assedness. they are a hoot! but, in a way that is embarrassing. like an uncle that is so absurd, you hope your friends don't come over when he's there, because you will be embarrassed by him.Life isn't all pretty, and we don't all look like Paris or Brittany or Tom or Leonardo.. life is cruel. life is hard. And most all of us can relate to Napoleon. Great acting, great humor. Great humor with a straight face. And great dancing at the end. Which reminds me, I enjoyed his friend, the Mexican kid, can't remember his name. Good on him too!My dear man, Norman, laughed his bum off (can i say ass?)

628601,A37S3ACL57LN62,B00005JNBQ,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[12, 12]","Napoleon Dynamite has been recently released on DVD. The small, independent film has become one with a lot of fans. Buttons declaring, ""I love tater tots"" and ""Vote for Pedro"" are sold in popular stores. T-shirts identical to those worn by cast members are sold at many online websites.Why has the nation fallen in love with Napoleon Dynamite? For one thing, the characters are incredibly memorable. Napoleon is a classic outcast who walks around with his eyes half closed and his mouth half open saying random things like, ""I caught you a delicious bass"" and playing tether ball by himself. His brother Kip, a thirty two year old man with braces, chats online all day with ""babes"" and meets the love of his life, a black woman named Lafawnduh who teaches him how men behave in Detroit where she lives. The Dynamite brothers are forced to be babysat by their uncle Rico when their grandmother is injured in a dirt bike accident. Rico wishes he lived in the 1980s although much of the movie seems to be set then anyway. Napoleon's friend Pedro, a new kid at school, decides to run for class president. Deb, a shy girl, takes glamour shots and sells boondoggle key chains to raise money for college. Each of the outcast characters has their own unique personality traits that make the movie funny and interesting.The pacing of the film is slow at times and after viewing it the first time, you might be thinking, ""What just happened?"" Think about the jokes, think about the characters, and you'll be laughing for sure.Many of the scenes in the film are random. When the film starts, viewers see Napoleon embarking on a children's school bus and tossing an action figure attached to a string out the window. The scene ends and is never made reference to again.That last scene at the end of the credits is a welcome addition to the film.The deleted scenes are pretty good too. The best one is where they kids are playing kickball in gym class.Much of the movie seems to take place in the 1980s although it is not. Deb wears her hair in a side ponytail in several scenes. The school dance features Cindi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" and puffy sleeved dresses. However, more modern things tell that the town is only partially in a timewarp. The Backstreet Boys' ""Larger Than Life"" is played at the end of the film. The confusion over the time period adds to the subtle humor of the film.Most of the humor is found in Napoleon's own mind. He believes that girls only like guys with skills so he wants to learn how to use nun chucks and hack into computers. He also tells stories about ""ligers,"" his favorite animals which are bred from a lion and a tiger for their magical powers. One of his most common utterances when asked what he is going to do is, ""Whatever I feel like I want to do, gosh!""Some of the film seems clich&eacute; like the popular girls that are mean to Napoleon and Pedro and some of the jokes but these things are downplayed and take a backseat to the scenes between the outcast characters.The full effect of the film can only be experienced when one sees the way the actors deliver their lines and maintain their characters. Overall, it is an excellent comedy and a nice change of pace from the standard formula we are used to.",5,Napoleon Dynamite is Sweet!,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,3239,"['Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'been', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD', 'small', 'independent', 'film', 'become', 'one', 'lot', 'fans', 'Buttons', 'declaring', 'love', 'tater', 'tots', 'Vote', 'Pedro', 'are', 'sold', 'popular', 'stores', 'T-shirts', 'identical', 'worn', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'sold', 'many', 'online', 'websites.Why', 'nation', 'fallen', 'love', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'one', 'thing', 'characters', 'are', 'incredibly', 'memorable', 'Napoleon', 'classic', 'outcast', 'who', 'eyes', 'half', 'closed', 'mouth', 'half', 'open', 'saying', 'random', 'things', 'caught', 'delicious', 'bass', 'playing', 'tether', 'ball', 'brother', 'Kip', 'thirty', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'braces', 'chats', 'online', 'day', 'babes', 'love', 'life', 'black', 'woman', 'named', 'Lafawnduh', 'who', 'how', 'men', 'behave', 'Detroit', 'where', 'Dynamite', 'brothers', 'are', 'forced', 'be', 'babysat', 'uncle', 'Rico', 'when', 'grandmother', 'injured', 'dirt', 'bike', 'accident', 'Rico', 'lived', '1980s', 'much', 'movie', 'be', 'set', 'then', 'anyway', 'Napoleon', 'friend', 'Pedro', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'run', 'class', 'president', 'Deb', 'shy', 'girl', 'glamour', 'shots', 'boondoggle', 'key', 'chains', 'raise', 'money', 'college', 'outcast', 'characters', 'own', 'unique', 'personality', 'make', 'movie', 'funny', 'interesting.The', 'pacing', 'film', 'slow', 'times', 'viewing', 'first', 'time', 'might', 'be', 'thinking', 'What', 'just', 'happened', 'Think', 'jokes', 'think', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'sure.Many', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'random', 'When', 'film', 'viewers', 'see', 'Napoleon', 'embarking', 'children', 'school', 'bus', 'tossing', 'action', 'figure', 'attached', 'string', 'out', 'window', 'scene', 'ends', 'never', 'made', 'reference', 'last', 'scene', 'end', 'credits', 'welcome', 'addition', 'film.The', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'best', 'one', 'where', 'kids', 'are', 'playing', 'kickball', 'gym', 'class.Much', 'movie', 'take', 'place', '1980s', 'not', 'Deb', 'hair', 'side', 'ponytail', 'several', 'scenes', 'school', 'dance', 'features', 'Cindi', 'Lauper', 'Time', 'Time', 'puffy', 'sleeved', 'dresses', 'However', 'more', 'modern', 'things', 'tell', 'town', 'only', 'partially', 'timewarp', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'Larger', 'Than', 'Life', 'played', 'end', 'film', 'confusion', 'time', 'period', 'subtle', 'humor', 'film.Most', 'humor', 'found', 'Napoleon', 'own', 'mind', 'girls', 'only', 'guys', 'skills', 'so', 'learn', 'how', 'use', 'nun', 'chucks', 'hack', 'computers', 'also', 'stories', 'ligers', 'favorite', 'animals', 'are', 'bred', 'lion', 'tiger', 'magical', 'powers', 'One', 'most', 'common', 'utterances', 'when', 'asked', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'feel', 'want', 'do', 'gosh', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'popular', 'girls', 'are', 'mean', 'Napoleon', 'Pedro', 'jokes', 'things', 'are', 'downplayed', 'take', 'backseat', 'scenes', 'outcast', 'characters.The', 'full', 'effect', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'experienced', 'when', 'one', 'way', 'actors', 'deliver', 'lines', 'maintain', 'characters', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'standard', 'formula', 'are', 'used']",Napoleon Dynamite

OK, maybe most people won't laugh, but this is a film with a fiercely loyal cult following (count how many Vote For Pedro shirts you see on your campus) that will appeal to former teen outcasts, nerds and Aspies (OK, so maybe the Aspie bit is redundant). Napoleon is a geeky high schooler/prodigal Aspie who wears snow boots in summer, draws Pegasus and unicorns in his Trapper Keeper, and lives with his very butch grandmother, a finicky llama named Tina, and Kip, his nerdy older brother who ""chats online with babes all day"" and is training to be a cage fighter (yeah, right).Napoleon's school life consists of getting beat up by the resident jocks, and his home life isn't much better. (""How was school?"" his grandmother asks Napoleon. ""The worst day of my life, what do you think?"").  He soon meets Deb, a geeky, painfully shy neighbor who is earning money for college by producing glamour shots in her basement and selling those funky boondoggle keychains (I am SO a child of the `80s!), and Pedro, a Mexican fresh across the border, who answers everything in a syllable or less, wears holy medals, and has santo candles ringing his bathtub.The movie is filled with out-there moments: after Napoleon's grandma breaks her tailbone on the sand dunes (don't even ask!), his obnoxious Uncle Rico (which means ""rich"" in Spanish, appropriate because Rico is full of failed get-rich-quick schemes) comes to stay. Rico and Napoleon engage in heated battle, including flinging steaks and grapefruit at each other from moving vehicles, testing a time machine they bought online (which produces groinal electrocution), and Kip finally meets his Internet chat room honey LaFawnduh in the ample flesh (I thought, after a prolonged setup, that....well, never mind, put the pieces together for yourself. Hint: it involves Kip's comment about never seeing a full bodyshot of LaFawnduh before they meet).Napoleon now has a gang of loyal geek outcasts, and the trio try to make their way through another horrible school year, including the prom and class elections. This leads to the film's funniest scene involving Napoleon, an awesome Jamiroquai song (Canned Heat), and D-Kwon's Dance Grooves. Actually, I found this film to be hysterical, being a) a child of the `80s and b) an incorrigible social outcast in high school.

They quite literally have absolutely nothing going for them except an exchange of oxygen and an ability to ambulate.There is Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) who is a skinny, slack open-mouth-breather with frizzy orange hair and pants worn so high they look like they are eating him.  He is sullen and caustic, making up ridiculous stories that make him seem more important.  He lives with his fast-living Grandmother (Sandy Martin) and his 32-year-old unemployed brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Kip is skinny, poorly dressed, distinctly stupid, and spends his entire day in chat rooms on his PC.Grandma gets injured while jumping her Quad over a sand dune, and sends Uncle Rico to watch the ""boys"".  Uncle Rico (played by Jon Gries) is an even older loser who lives in a hideous orange van, and constantly wishes he could time travel back to 1982 to change the outcome of a football game that he believes would have made him famous.  He makes his living doing door-to-door sales of everything from Tupperware to bust-enhancers.Don't forget to watch this movie all the way to the end of the credits.  After the final credits, there is another entire scene to watch that you won't want to miss.Napoleon Dynamite is well acted and well filmed, but is more a study in human ineptness rather than an outright comedy.  I would have liked to have seen more of Grandma in the movie, I believe she could have brought a little action and a few more laughs to the film.  Over all, not bad, but not good either.  My preference would have been to give it only 3.5 stars, but gave `Napoleon' the benefit of the doubt.

628608,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JNBQ,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 6]","There's something about high school that provides endless fodder for great movies.  ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" ""Sixteen Candles,"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" captured the '80s angst of my high school years.  ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" may be about the generation after mine, but both movies had so much truth and wisdom that they spoke to a geezer like me as well as their target audience.  I know I'll watch all of these movies in 20 years and they will still ring true to me then.""Napoleon Dynamite"" tries to be in the same mold as these essential films.  It tries to skewer the dark underbelly of high school, with its baseless favoritism, its soulless disregard for the unpopular, and its mind-numbing tedium.  To a certain extent, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" succeeds - there are a few laugh-out-loud moments about the truth of high school life.But ""Napoleon Dynamite"" falls a bit through its titular hero.  Napoleon may be the biggest geek ever to have his own film.  To a certain extent, Napoleon is universal.  Like every high school student, his inner talents are bound by insecurity and immaturity.  So Napoleon responds with lies (the fictitious girlfriend from Oklahoma, the mastery of martial arts) and insults to protect himself.  Who didn't do something like that when they were 15?And while Napoleon has an undeniable sweetness to him, the movie keeps the audience at arm's length.  This is a movie populated by morons, dweebs, and dorks.  They speak in sudden bursts of banality.  While the cast generally has the pent-up insecurity down, the movie screams for someone like Max Fischer from ""Rushmore"" to speak with poetry and spirit about who he is and where he wants to go.Instead, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" offers no hope for its characters (some of whom it seems to love).  The high school students are varying degrees of cloistered non-entities, and the adults generally seem to be the same.  When Napoleon's older brother gets married to a towering African American, LaFonda, she is played strictly for laughs and he remains the same befuddled twit, only now in gangsta garb.  Sure, it's funny, and LaFonda's devotion to him is as sweet as it is inexplicable.  But it doesn't seem to go anywhere other than to the surreal.  No character offers Napoleon any hope that his future in the wilds of Idaho offers anything other than endless years of frustration and yearning -- playing tetherball, even with your soulmate, gets old after a while.Indeed, when the DJ plays Alphaville's cheesy ""classic"" ""Forever Young"" at a dance, the lyric ""I want to be forever young"" doesn't seem like an anthem to these kids.  It feels more like a prison sentence.Yet I'm glad that I've seen ""Napoleon Dynamite.""  Not only did I get some genuine laughs out of the movie, I now understand the point of all those retro ""Vote for Pedro"" T-shirts I've been seeing.A funny movie that's worth a rental, but not a slot in the video library.",3,"Cult smash not up to standards of ""Election"" or ""Rushmore""",1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,2923,"['something', 'about', 'high', 'school', 'endless', 'fodder', 'great', 'movies', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'captured', ""'80s"", 'angst', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'Election', 'Rushmore', 'may', 'be', 'generation', 'mine', 'movies', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'truth', 'wisdom', 'spoke', 'geezer', 'as', 'well', 'target', 'audience', 'know', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'movies', '20', 'years', 'will', 'still', 'ring', 'true', 'then', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'be', 'same', 'mold', 'essential', 'films', 'skewer', 'dark', 'underbelly', 'high', 'school', 'baseless', 'favoritism', 'soulless', 'disregard', 'unpopular', 'mind-numbing', 'tedium', 'certain', 'extent', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'are', 'few', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'truth', 'high', 'school', 'life.But', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'bit', 'titular', 'hero', 'Napoleon', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'geek', 'ever', 'have', 'own', 'film', 'certain', 'extent', 'Napoleon', 'universal', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'inner', 'talents', 'are', 'bound', 'insecurity', 'immaturity', 'So', 'Napoleon', 'responds', 'lies', 'fictitious', 'girlfriend', 'Oklahoma', 'mastery', 'martial', 'arts', 'insults', 'protect', 'Who', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'when', 'were', '15', 'Napoleon', 'undeniable', 'sweetness', 'movie', 'audience', 'arm', 'length', 'movie', 'populated', 'morons', 'dweebs', 'dorks', 'speak', 'sudden', 'bursts', 'banality', 'cast', 'generally', 'pent-up', 'insecurity', 'down', 'movie', 'screams', 'someone', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'Rushmore', 'speak', 'poetry', 'spirit', 'who', 'where', 'go.Instead', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'hope', 'characters', 'whom', 'love', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'are', 'varying', 'degrees', 'cloistered', 'non-entities', 'adults', 'generally', 'seem', 'be', 'same', 'When', 'Napoleon', 'older', 'brother', 'married', 'towering', 'African', 'American', 'LaFonda', 'played', 'strictly', 'laughs', 'same', 'befuddled', 'twit', 'only', 'now', 'gangsta', 'garb', 'Sure', 'funny', 'LaFonda', 'devotion', 'as', 'sweet', 'inexplicable', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'anywhere', 'other', 'surreal', 'character', 'Napoleon', 'hope', 'future', 'wilds', 'Idaho', 'offers', 'anything', 'other', 'endless', 'years', 'frustration', 'yearning', 'playing', 'tetherball', 'even', 'soulmate', 'old', 'while.Indeed', 'when', 'DJ', 'Alphaville', 'cheesy', 'classic', 'Forever', 'Young', 'dance', 'lyric', 'want', 'be', 'forever', 'young', ""n't"", 'seem', 'anthem', 'kids', 'more', 'prison', 'sentence.Yet', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'get', 'genuine', 'movie', 'now', 'understand', 'point', 'retro', 'Vote', 'Pedro', 'T-shirts', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeing.A', 'funny', 'movie', 'rental', 'not', 'slot', 'video', 'library']",Napoleon Dynamite

Poza,"[6, 7]","My husband, who grew up in an affluent subarb in California, and I, who grew up in a tiny little coal town in Pennsylvania, viewed this movie very differently. For me, there was a great deal of resonance to the sort of kids I grew up with (and perhaps to some extent the certain type of kid I was) in high school in the 70s. To him, the characters seemed too dumb and unlikeable.I could only guess that those who grow up in urban or suburban settings see less of the sort of inarticulate, unsophisticated kid that Napoleon is and find the character lacking credibility and cannot empathize with him to any extent. Of course, this is a character in a movie that can be categorized as a ""quirky comedy"" so he's about 30% more dorky and inarticulate than the worst of what I grew up with but he's close enough to the real thing not to be a parody or caricature.The movie doesn't really have much of a plot but seems more to track a segment of Napoleon's life. Napoleon is awkward, unattractive, and expresses himself in socially inapproriate ways. He's like a 10 year-old stuck in a 16-year old's body. He copes with his lack of ability to relate to others by attempting to form friendships based on very little communication and by drawing fantasy characters of his own invention. The viewer gets the feeling Napoleon isn't quite self-aware enough to be too bothered by anything but is old enough to have certain impulses (like the desire for a girlfriend) that he acts on.The interesting thing about this movie is that, despite his awkwardness, you don't feel sorry for Napoleon because he doesn't feel sorry for himself. He also doesn't seem to get very angry at the injustice of being placed low in the social pecking order or being randomly hit and harrassed by his schoolmates. For the most part, he simply does his thing. It's not that he's oblivious to what is happening, he's just coping in the only way he can and most of those efforts are what are funny about the movie.This isn't a movie with obvious or broad humor. It's the antithesis of humor based on wit or clever dialog while not being stupid humor. It's humor much in the same way that ""Lost in Translation"" was a romance.

Napoleon (Jon Heder) is so awkward that it's difficult for his character to gain traction at first.  He's just not very likable - not even in a sad sack sort of way. OK. But it just isn't Napoleon.  His family is an assorted bunch of nuts you've come to expect now in Indie films, and that means there's plenty of dead air and blank stares.  So much so that you're remembering the same ""realistic"" devices used in Indie films like ""Ghost World,"" ""The Station Agent,"" or ""Welcome to the Doll House.""  Don't' get me wrong, I love all those films - but with ""Napoleon"" there is a studied sameness that lacks the freshness of those movies.  Whatever.  So why did I like this?  Well, the movie's kind of sneaky in how it accomplishes this.  Basically, Napoleon starts to come out of his shell due to friendships he begins to forge (despite himself) - with kids that are almost as awkward as himself - in particular, Pedro, his best friend, and Deb, his budding love interest  (played effectively by Efren Ramirez and Tina Majorino).  And one virtue Napoleon has is loyalty to his friends. Further, most high schools are overwhelmingly populated by Napoleons, Pedros, and Debs, and not by the beautiful few, who always seem to run the yearbooks and win the class elections.  The end of the movie sealed things for me.  Napoleon, in an act of friendship, shows he has the stuff, and all is right with the world.  This is probably a three star movie, but there is a genuine sweetness that bumps it up one for me.

He has no friends, he's picked on by bullies, he has a somewhat-odd home life ... but through it all, he's sure things will be just plain okay in the end.Napoleon and his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) live with their grandmother, but at the beginning of the film she tells them she needs to take off for a couple days. Enter their Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), a self-starter who's living in 1982 (when the coach of his high school football team declined to put him in as quarterback, thus altering Rico's life forever). Some of the funniest scenes in the film involve Napoleon's often-combative relationship with Uncle Rico; Rico is also bound and determined to return to those halcyon days of his youth via a time machine he's seen advertised on the Internet, and he enlists Kip to help him raise the funds.Napoleon befriends the new kid in school, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), who has a sweet bike, can talk to girls, and has an actual mustache. But like Napoleon, Pedro is a misfit. Both sometimes hang out with yet another taciturn student, Deb (Tina Majorino, all grown up from Waterworld), who secretly (it seems) likes Napoleon. But there isn't a lot of focus on their relationship, because Napoleon himself is fairly oblivious to how people perceive him. This isn't a story about young love or lust, it's a story about a misfit refusing to fit - while fitting in with others like him.Jon Heder is perfectly cast as the gawky, dorky Napoleon; he resembles Butt-Head in countenance, although certainly not in temperament or intelligence. Mouth agape and with an awkward gait, Napoleon is about as odd a duck as you'd find in high school, and yet he still manages to survive with his dignity intact. He's a good egg, although he seems to overreact at times: ""What are you gonna do today, Napoleon? Napoleon: Whatever I feel like I wanna do.....GOSH!"" Still, his delivery is perfect. You can readily picture a Napoleon in any high school.I think where the film ultimately succeeds, aside from the casting of Heder, is that it doesn't fall into the traps of predictability and stereotyping. Sure, it's a high school movie, and there are snobby pretty girls and arrogant jocks, but not much time is devoted to them. Sure, there's a big dance, but it doesn't necessarily turn out the way you'd expect it to. What you're left with, then, isn't a typical coming-of-age story, but rather a unique take on a rather mundane - albeit life-altering - time in a boy's life.",5,Funny and unique!,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,2584,"['Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'typical', 'sad-sack', 'loser', 'permeated', 'high', 'schools', 'seemingly', 'centuries', 'friends', 'picked', 'bullies', 'somewhat-odd', 'home', 'life', 'sure', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'plain', 'okay', 'end.Napoleon', 'older', 'brother', 'Kip', 'Aaron', 'Ruell', 'live', 'grandmother', 'beginning', 'film', 'take', 'off', 'couple', 'days', 'Enter', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'self-starter', 'who', 'living', '1982', 'when', 'coach', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'declined', 'put', 'quarterback', 'thus', 'altering', 'Rico', 'life', 'forever', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'film', 'involve', 'Napoleon', 'often-combative', 'relationship', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'Rico', 'also', 'bound', 'determined', 'return', 'halcyon', 'days', 'youth', 'time', 'machine', 'seen', 'advertised', 'Internet', 'Kip', 'help', 'raise', 'funds.Napoleon', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'Pedro', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'who', 'sweet', 'bike', 'can', 'talk', 'girls', 'actual', 'mustache', 'Napoleon', 'Pedro', 'misfit', 'sometimes', 'out', 'yet', 'taciturn', 'student', 'Deb', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'grown', 'up', 'Waterworld', 'who', 'secretly', 'Napoleon', ""n't"", 'lot', 'focus', 'relationship', 'Napoleon', 'fairly', 'oblivious', 'how', 'people', 'perceive', ""n't"", 'story', 'young', 'love', 'lust', 'story', 'misfit', 'refusing', 'fit', 'fitting', 'others', 'him.Jon', 'Heder', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'gawky', 'dorky', 'Napoleon', 'Butt-Head', 'countenance', 'certainly', 'not', 'temperament', 'intelligence', 'Mouth', 'agape', 'awkward', 'gait', 'Napoleon', 'odd', 'duck', ""'d"", 'find', 'high', 'school', 'yet', 'still', 'survive', 'dignity', 'intact', 'good', 'egg', 'overreact', 'times', 'What', 'are', 'gon', 'do', 'today', 'Napoleon', 'Napoleon', 'feel', 'wan', 'na', 'do', '..GOSH', 'Still', 'delivery', 'perfect', 'can', 'readily', 'picture', 'Napoleon', 'high', 'school.I', 'think', 'where', 'film', 'ultimately', 'aside', 'casting', 'Heder', ""n't"", 'fall', 'traps', 'predictability', 'stereotyping', 'Sure', 'high', 'school', 'movie', 'are', 'snobby', 'pretty', 'girls', 'arrogant', 'jocks', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'devoted', 'Sure', 'big', 'dance', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'turn', 'out', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'What', ""'re"", 'left', 'then', ""n't"", 'typical', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'rather', 'unique', 'take', 'rather', 'mundane', 'life-altering', 'time', 'boy', 'life']",Napoleon Dynamite

There is a twist. This is probably one of the top five cliched plots in filmwriting school. However, it is worth seeing because of the original characters. Napoleon is the nerds nerd. He dozes through life not so much angst ridden as suffused with ennui. He accepts his lowly status - his lack of 'skills', the regular locker slammings, his rediculous family (such as his older, charisma free brother Chip who chats up 'babes' on the internet) and his lack of friends. His relations with girls are comically stilted 'I like your sleeves'. 'Thanks, I made them myself'. Eventually he finds salvation through his only two friends - monosyllabic Mexican Pedro, who is up against popular and pretty Summer for class president, and the erstwhile Debs, who is the classic beautiful ugly girl, if you catch my drift. The setting is also superbly quirky - dry, stifling rural Idaho complete with red barns and hick farmers who pay a dollar an hour for chicken relocation and reward their workers with raw egg shakes.The ending is predictable, in the 'School of Rock' mode, though do stay on after the credits for the 'real', hidden ending - I won't reveal, but it's the best scene of the movie!",3,New wine in old wineskins,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,1391,"['Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'nothing', 'new', 'when', 'plot', 'nerdy', 'outcasts', 'suffer', 'locker', 'slammings', 'unpopularity', 'loneliness', 'face', 'pretty', 'popular', 'things', 'only', 'find', 'just', 'wait', 'twist', 'probably', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'cliched', 'plots', 'filmwriting', 'school', 'However', 'worth', 'seeing', 'original', 'characters', 'Napoleon', 'nerds', 'nerd', 'life', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'angst', 'ridden', 'suffused', 'ennui', 'lowly', 'status', 'lack', ""'skills"", 'regular', 'locker', 'slammings', 'rediculous', 'family', 'such', 'older', 'charisma', 'free', 'brother', 'Chip', 'who', 'up', ""'babes"", 'internet', 'lack', 'friends', 'relations', 'girls', 'are', 'comically', 'stilted', 'sleeves', ""'Thanks"", 'made', 'Eventually', 'salvation', 'only', 'two', 'friends', 'monosyllabic', 'Mexican', 'Pedro', 'who', 'up', 'popular', 'pretty', 'Summer', 'class', 'president', 'erstwhile', 'Debs', 'who', 'classic', 'beautiful', 'ugly', 'girl', 'catch', 'drift', 'setting', 'also', 'superbly', 'quirky', 'dry', 'stifling', 'rural', 'Idaho', 'complete', 'red', 'barns', 'hick', 'farmers', 'who', 'pay', 'dollar', 'hour', 'chicken', 'relocation', 'reward', 'workers', 'raw', 'egg', 'shakes.The', 'ending', 'predictable', ""'School"", 'Rock', 'mode', 'though', 'do', 'stay', 'credits', ""'real"", 'hidden', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'best', 'scene', 'movie']",Napoleon Dynamite

But there's some real subtle acting that I didn't notice at first because its such a weird movie with quirky characters which are funny, but distract one initially from the theme. Its almost a perfect movie, which will be appreaciated as the years pass by. Some of the scenes which are really subtle are when Napoleon's date leaves him at the dance, and he looks at himself in the mirror.The movie is about high school outcasts, dreamers and wannabees. It brings you into their world without patronizing them. A world of drawing and dreaming about unicorns and babes and wanting to be accepted and liked. Its about how we judge people, or rather misjudging people'a worth, and the meaning of friendship and loyalty. It's about how everyone has personal worth.  Its about wanting to say the right thing, when you don't have the skills to, and having friends accept one for who they are. In the end, I'm always charmed by Napoleon's courage to be happy with who he is, and Deb's acceptance of him as he is. It's such a charming movie. It's ok to be happy with yourself, no matter how strange your interests, and finding out that you like people for who they are inside.

I believe this is one of those movies.On the surface it is a funny movie about nerdy kids and their daily lives.  The movie is not laugh out loud funny, nor is it a ""nerd kids strike back at the system"" formula movie.  There are no Hollywood stars or Hollywood pretentiousness.  The story is small, local, evenly paced and engaging.Beneath the surface there is an important message about the inherent nobility and value possible in every human being, no matter what their surface appearance.Napolean is pushed around and mocked by classmates, but he seems to accept it as part of his existence.  He seems perfectly content with who he is and seems to, accurately, believe the problems are with who everyone else thinks he is.  When he has the opportunity to ""pay back"" those humiliating him, he does it in an entirely creative and satisfying way.  There is no violence and no humiliation in his response to his peers.  He wins because he demonstrates nobility, talent and loyalty to his friends that raises him above those who demean him.  He uses his inate humanity to shine a bright light on the shallowness of those that would place themselves above him.His friends and relatives, each on the surface a ""loser,"" get the opportunity to individually rise above the audiences automatic expectations of their ""loser-ness"" and become fully important and credible people.I would highly recommend this film as an excellent family film, especially for families with kids in middle school and high school.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[2, 5]","Napolean Dynamite is the sleeper hit of the year.A tale of an absurdly unpopular kid named Napolean Dynamite who lives around losers; his brother who spends his entire time on the internet chatting with his ""girlfriend"" who he has never met in person, his uncle who hasn't got over the loss of a football career 20 years past and shoots himself on camera throwing some lousy passes, his grandmother who goes on motorcycle ventures, a girl interest who has a pony tail on one side of her head, and a friend named Pedro who does not speak good english and goes out 'building' cakes for girls he wants to ask out to the dance and later runs for class president against the most popular blonde in the school. Pretty much, all the characters in Napolean are wierdos! But that's what makes them likable, and that's what makes the viewer not take the movie seriously and just laugh it away.However, the movie does end with a nice resolution for all the characters' deficiencies. The movie wraps with the class presidential campaign where Napolean gives his remarkable dance and blows everybody away!All the actors in the movie are unknown or just not famous.

I hated Napoleon Dynamite, but that's not saying you will, it's just my two cents.  It's one of those films where you have to like the main character or else you're screwed, coz you have to spend the duration of the film with him.  Some people feel this way about Woody Allen, some Jerry Lewis, to me it's Napoleon Dynamite.  Now I'm all in favor of films that show the underdog/outcast getting his/her shot at glory, and I also like to think I have a pretty broad sense of humor.  This movie only seems to have one joke that they stretch out for 84 minutes-Look at the dorky guy looking dorky, saying and doing dorky things.  Dorky can be funny, but Napoleon is downright unpleasant, unlikable and unfunny.  Plus he has a dorky brother, dorky uncle and dorky semi-girlfriend, so we get to push the whole dorky joke even further.  There are alot of hypocrites who really like the Napoleon character and think he's cool, yet if this same guy went to your high school as opposed to being a movie character, you'd hate him.  Napoleon's friend, Pedro is from the Cheech and Chong school of funny.  If you like Mexican characters that speak as though they're stoned, drunk or just dumb, you'll find Pedro funny.  I just think he's a stereotype myself.  He's a live action version of Speedy Gonzales' drunk cousin, Slowpoke Rodriguez.  I barely smiled at this film, let alone laughed.  Considering MTV productions had a hand in this ""independant"" feature, you can kinda guess what kind of humor we're talking about.  And seeing the MTV name attached to this film makes me worry about the future of independant films.  It has one or two chuckles(not surprisingly the laughs came from every character but Napoleon), and Napoleon's dance at the end was pretty well done, but it just didn't do it for me.  Already I've noticed the extremely annoying epidemic of people freely quoting from this film.  There's nothing worse than people quoting unfunny lines from an unfunny movie, then cracking up at their own joke.  You'll notice this happens with people who quote Monty Python and The Holy Grail(complete with rotten English accent), only difference being that Monty Python manage to be funny.  More than likely I'll be brushed off as one who ""just didn't get it"", but that's cool coz I'm sure I can think of many films you won't ""get"" either.

628635,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,B00005JNBQ,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[4, 8]","I was invited to my Sister's house yesterday to watch NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, a movie that I had heard many good things about.  The movie reviewer for our local paper, 'The Arizona Republic' (more appropriately called, 'The Daily Disappointment' by the former mayor of Prescott, Sam Steiger) proclaimed it the sleeper of 2004.  And that's a label that might apply to many of its potential viewers.  As the DVD was inserted into the player, and I settled onto the sofa, my 16-year-old Niece, Shannon, who had seen the movie previously, said, ""It's a pointless movie; it has no storyline.""  Oh, the wisdom that sometimes emanates from the mouths of babes!I contemplated some of the clever and funny ways I might review NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, but decided to tackle it from an angle I seldom employ : straightforward.  I suppose it's understandable why some kids (8 to 12 perhaps) might find this movie entertaining, but this review is a public service announcement for everybody else tempted to buy or rent this ""sleeper.""  QUESTION : Is it fair to harshly criticize a simple little comedy?  (A poor word to describe this movie, but one must categorize.)  ANSWER : Yes, because it asks for $20. of your money and / or 86 minutes of your valuable time!NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a movie without any ""skills"", but plenty of problems.  This is dynamite that only blows up in the viewer's face.PROBLEM #1 : I understand that the movie was originally a concept for a student film.  Well, the writer / director is STILL a student because he evidently doesn't understand the most rudimentary principles of filmmaking.  A movie needs a central conflict that propels the viewer from scene to scene.  This is something that most foreign filmmakers have also failed to grasp.  They're still trying to put books on film, and they usually bore because novels and movies are two different mediums with unique necessities.  It is possible for an episodic film to succeed, but this is exceedingly rare and requires that every scene be poignant and expand the viewer's understanding of the characters.  NAPOLEON DYNAMITE simply moves from one supposedly amusing skit to another.  The scenes lack dynamism and do not illustrate previously unexplored facets of the characters.  And that brings up another problem...THE CHARACTERS : The principal character, Napoleon Dynamite, could best be described as a two-toned dog : 'Goofy' with the hairstyle of a poodle!  It's fine to have an odd character or two, but you cannot entirely people your story with oddballs.  You must have one or two ""ordinary"" characters to balance the relationships.  Here, the only characters who are not overtly strange are simply one-dimensional bullies and snobbish school queens who appear only occasionally to act as a foil for the misfits.  Consider that great sit-com, 'THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW' : In the early days, Griffith played Andy Taylor as ""a heavy-handed rural clown,"" and it didn't really work; there were too many of that sort in the cast.  One day, Griffith said, ""I just realized that I'm the straight man.  I'm playing straight to all these kooks around me.""  The next season he downplayed his character, becoming the true heart and soul of the show.  NAPOLEON DYNAMITE has no heart and soul; it is just a bunch of kooks in search of a story.  And unbelievable kooks at that.  (The scenes between LaFawnduh and Kip were preposterous in the extreme.  And Kip - what a cool name for such a doofus.  The Kip I know is intelligent, witty, wise, and...oh, yeah...humble!)Sure, there were a few nice moments that elicited a smile or a snicker or two from me.  They did manage to convey that sense of insecurity and social ineptitude of young people (especially through the monosyllabic dialogue).  Seeing Napoleon step out of his cocoon and daringly help his friend Pedro at the school assembly was the one moment in which we see some sort of genuine growth in a character.  The shot of Napoleon practicing his dance moves through his partially closed bedroom door was the one artistic flair that got my attention.  Nicely done.  And I did appreciate the fact that here was a movie without the customary nudity, and over-the-top profanity and violence.  But it takes more than that to justify spending an hour and a half of my time in front of the ""Lobotomizer.""It's clear to me that Hollyweird is now officially out of ideas.  The Hollyweirdos have been reduced to making movies based on comic books (Superman; Batman; Spiderman, et. al.), TV shows (The Brady Bunch; The Honeymooners; Bewitched), remaking movies that don't need any remaking (Born Yesterday; The Longest Yard; The Bad News Bears), and trying to pass off student movies as genuine films (Napoleon Dynamite).  Don't be fooled : NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is nothing more than a low-budget student movie that pretends to make some sort of statement, and imagines itself to be a ""film""; it's an invisibly small-scale story that desires to be thought of as something bigger and more important.  Kind of like that other Napoleon.",2,"""A MOVIE WITHOUT ANY SKILLS""",1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,5032,"['was', 'invited', 'Sister', 'house', 'yesterday', 'watch', 'NAPOLEON', 'DYNAMITE', 'movie',

628639,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B00005JNBQ,Steven Hancock,"[4, 8]","""Napoleon Dynamite"" is one of those movies which should only be seen once. The main character, Napoleon Dynamite, becomes annoying 2/3's of the way into the film. Basing the movie around him becomes the film's major problem. John Heder does what he can with the character, but doesn't succeed much.However, the film does feature fascinating supporting characters. The best character is Pedro, who is one of the best low-key comedic characters I've ever seen. The actor does a commendable job. The rest of the cast is also fascinating, and makes the film bearable.The DVD also features extras that, like the film itself, only require one viewing. If you're interested in low-key comedies, then this film is for you. For the rest, ""Spaceballs"" and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" are funnier!Movie/DVD Grade: B-",4,"A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT STILL WORTH A LOOK!",1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,811,"['Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'one', 'movies', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'once', 'main', 'character', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'annoying', '2/3', ""'s"", 'way', 'film', 'Basing', 'movie', 'film', 'major', 'problem', 'John', 'Heder', 'what', 'can', 'character', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'much.However', 'film', 'feature', 'fascinating', 'supporting', 'characters', 'best', 'character', 'Pedro', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'low-key', 'comedic', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'actor', 'commendable', 'job', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'fascinating', 'film', 'bearable.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'extras', 'film', 'only', 'require', 'one', 'viewing', ""'re"", 'interested', 'low-key', 'comedies', 'then', 'film', 'rest', 'Spaceballs', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'are', 'funnier', 'Movie/DVD', 'Grade', 'B-']",Napoleon Dynamite

628652,A2CCMDEZSWKMGQ,B00005JNBQ,The Judge of the Value of all Entertainment & Art,"[3, 5]","This movie is one of my favorites of 2004 and all-time, despite my having low expectations before watching it.Even a levelheaded viewer who didn't enjoy this film would have trouble claiming that it was ""flawed."" The execution is pretty much perfect -- there are no throwaway lines, all of the loose ends in the plot tie back to each other, and every character has a genuinely satisfying arc. Despite the surreal nature of these characters and the world they live in, I really did care about their fate and was touched by the ways in which their lives unfolded. In any movie, let alone a comedy of this nature, that is a tremendous accomplishment.The problem is, though, that some people simply will not want to watch these characters for two hours. They are very strange and awkward, and while I myself found all of them except for villain Uncle Rico to be likable, it's understandable that some folks might be left scratching their heads and wondering what the fuss is about.With that disclaimer, I will move on to the movie's rating. This is one of very few PG movies I have ever seen that is worth watching. Usually, if you see ""PG"" on a box, you can expect braindead kiddie films that will harm young viewers more than any nudity or violence ever could.

Got there & was told they heard of a great movie we ALL were going to watch. Heard the name & I was like 'OH NO, I just saw that & it was terrible'. However, wanting them to form their own conclusion along with my kids & theirs (who had no idea I HATED THIS), we watched it. I kept my mouth shut the entire movie. My brother, sister in law, neices/nephews & my kids, along with 3 of the kids friends thought this was awful. The entire movie, all they did was rag on it & say it was 'STUPID' the entire flick. 'STUPID' was an adjective I used but never mentioned so I got quite a laugh hearing adults & 7 kids all use the same adjective, along with many more non flattering ones. & sorry to say, it was just as AWFUL watching it the 2nd time as it was the 1st. What really threw me was this is supposed to be a G rated 'family' flick, & I guess in theory it certainly is.....But needless to say us adults were quite off guard when the KIDS starting making comments about how the characters ALL LOOK STONED...Yep...KIDS made these comments!Anyway, just thought id edit this & add the above as not 1 of us liked this flick & ALL OF US thought it was HORRIBLE/STUPID...pick your most unflattering adjective & add it in....Even ALL the kids hated this.I know with movies everybody has different tastes but every now & then you see a flick leaving you wondering how anybody could have liked it. This is it!!! Again, I know everybody has different tastes & I respect the fact some liked or even loved this flick...but it still leaves me wondering how anybody could like this stupid tripe. IT WAS REALLY THAT BAD.....--------------------------------------------Saw this on tv. Saw it had 3.5 star rating which means excellent from my provider. Saw the reviews here which were pretty gapping. Not many 'in the middle'. Most are either 5 star or 1 star, meaning most either loved or hated it.Put me in the hated it camp.Yes, I forced myself to watch it & although I kept wanting to turn it off, I gave in & watched it all.I wont say this is the worst movie I ever watched but its high on the list.This flick was simply one of the most absurdly boring & 'stupid' flicks I have ever seen. While I fully understand everybody has different tastes, im still a bit shocked that anybody actually liked this ridiculous tripe.But please, watch it for yourself & form your own conclusion, as I did.But yep, If I tried listing everything I HATED about this flick, I'd be typing for hours.

She laughed, but AT Napoleon, in a kind of dumb-founded way that was always wondering what he was going to do next.  I laughed too, but because I've always rooted for the misfit, for the underdog, for the loner.  For the secret, naive-moron that we all are deep-down.  Whether it was drawing expertly-shaded pictures of the beautiful Trisha or giving a report on the exploits of our ""underwater ally"" (Nessie), I felt like I endured a million hours of junior high and high school with him sitting in the back of the class.I'm a professional firefighter, and I brought the DVD into work the next day.  Before we watched it, I was concerned that it would have too much ""dork appeal"" for a bunch of alpha-male men-of action.  But it soon dawned on me, as the room exploded in laughter again and again, that Napoleon was not so much a dork as he was a little boy who never really grew up.  And almost every man can remember what it was like to be 8 years old.The smarmy ""Summer Wheatley"" and her unctuous boyfriend looked like real people I went to school with.  That guy could've been a blonde version of Sherwin Adams from my class of 1993.  It was not difficult to want to see them fall from grace, especially at the hands of the dynamic and well-coiffed Pedro.The dance scene climax gave me chills to watch, because it reminds us that even the awkward, even the graceless, even the silly or stupid or ugly can do something well.  Can do something to admire, even to the point of being envious of it.This is a sweet, funny, unconventional film made by unorthodox people who poured their brains and heart into it.  You will laugh your head off at this movie, or it will miss you completely.  Like ""Bottle Rocket"", you cannot explain what is funny about it.  Kudos to Jack White for allowing them the use of the White Stripes song ""I think we're going to be friends"".Oh, keep watching after the credits, there's about 5 additional minutes of movie left.

Like many reviewers have said: either love it or hate it. I definitely have a sense of humor, but I really don't understand what was so cool or funny about this movie. Maybe had I been involved in the production of it I'd find enjoyment but it just wasn't my cup of meat!The acting was overkill. Better than your average B-movie, but they all just tried too hard. Napoleon and Pedro were the most annoying, most unbelievable characters I've ever seen. I've known a lot of dorks and dweebs in my life, but these guys were just stereotypical nerdage pushed beyond what was acceptable to me; no one is that dorky, come on!The plot was pathetic beyond any sense of logic. Maybe I should smoke a joint and try watching it again for it to make sense. Following some dork around who spits out lame lines that everyone quotes, only to have no real change in the end, was a huge letdown and made the movie worthless to me.The only saving grace was the dorky dance toward the end. Reminded me of the talent show in Revenge of the Nerds.The bonus features were 1000x's better than the actual movie. You're honestly better off renting this movie and just watching that.I can see how this became popular, as my generation is moving along and the new batch is coming forth, trying to make their impact in today's society. This movie (seems to me) tries to stamp itself as a classic similar to Fast Times At Ridgemount High or The Breakfast Club, just with a different formula.

There is never any final resolution, epiphany, or turning point.  It ends just as you've decided that you love the characters and really care about what happens to them. When the movie ends you find yourself asking: what happens next?  Who wins?  And about a dozen other questions that beg to be answered.The characters are indeed novel and hilarious.  The dead-pan humor is almost painful to watch it is so funny.  The performances are great by all involved.  My favorite was ""Kip""--Napolean's 32-year-old brother, but I was super intrigued by Kip's beautiful black girlfriend who he met on a web chatroom.  I wanted to learn a whole lot more about her, she is a very intriguing character. She definitely has bad taste in men, because Kip is about the biggest loser to ever walk the planet!  Uncle Rico was a classic with his football fantasies and sales schemes. So was Granny, who we basically only saw two times, the last time flying off her ATV.Napolean is a fascinating character.  He is different from most nerds: he is comfortable with who he is; one might even say he is brazenly confident.  I like that, he is a truly unique individual.  His little dance in front of classmates took a lot of...confidence, and I think that's why the kids cheered. My favorite scenes, however, were when Napolean is feeding his llama.  That was very amusing.Unfortunately, the plot never quite went full circle.  I was waiting for the climax, which was never forthcoming.  But this movie, when all is said and done, is a must-see.  It is an almost-classic.  It is a bittersweet movie, because it approaches the realm of the great, and just misses it. It reminds you how quirky people can be, and how even odd-balls can be likeable.  And, it shows you that even if you are an oddball, you have nothing to apologize for, because oddballs can be good people and have lots of fun as well.",4,Frustratingly Close to Excellent,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,2062,"['movie', 'disconcerting', 'hair', 'breadth', 'classic', 'heights', 'movies', 'Rushmore', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'short', 'too', 'soon', 'never', 'final', 'resolution', 'epiphany', 'turning', 'point', 'just', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'love', 'characters', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'When', 'movie', 'find', 'asking', 'what', 'next', 'Who', 'dozen', 'other', 'questions', 'beg', 'be', 'answered.The', 'characters', 'are', 'indeed', 'novel', 'hilarious', 'dead-pan', 'humor', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'so', 'funny', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'involved', 'favorite', 'was', 'Kip', 'Napolean', '32-year-old', 'brother', 'was', 'super', 'intrigued', 'Kip', 'beautiful', 'black', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'met', 'web', 'chatroom', 'wanted', 'learn', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'very', 'intriguing', 'character', 'definitely', 'bad', 'taste', 'men', 'Kip', 'biggest', 'loser', 'ever', 'walk', 'planet', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'was', 'classic', 'football', 'fantasies', 'sales', 'schemes', 'So', 'was', 'Granny', 'who', 'basically', 'only', 'saw', 'two', 'times', 'last', 'time', 'flying', 'off', 'ATV.Napolean', 'fascinating', 'character', 'different', 'most', 'nerds', 'comfortable', 'who', 'one', 'might', 'even', 'say', 'brazenly', 'confident', 'truly', 'unique', 'individual', 'little', 'dance', 'front', 'classmates', 'took', 'lot', 'confidence', 'think', 'why', 'kids', 'cheered', 'My', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'however', 'were', 'when', 'Napolean', 'feeding', 'llama', 'was', 'very', 'amusing.Unfortunately', 'plot', 'never', 'quite', 'went', 'full', 'circle', 'was', 'waiting', 'climax', 'was', 'never', 'forthcoming', 'movie', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'must-see', 'almost-classic', 'bittersweet', 'movie', 'realm', 'great', 'just', 'misses', 'how', 'quirky', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'even', 'odd-balls', 'can', 'be', 'likeable', 'even', 'are', 'oddball', 'have', 'nothing', 'apologize', 'oddballs', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'people', 'have', 'lots', 'fun', 'well']",Napoleon Dynamite

Various themes are touched upon:  family dysfunction, geeks get girls, and how self-confidence can overpower even near-constant peer negativity.Nevertheless, the enjoyment Dynamite offers is in the over-all effect of this clumsy, often clueless hero plowing through life, successfully overcoming a constant flow of obstacles.

Jared Hess makes an unforgettable directorial debut with NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, a hilarious, tender, and original portrait of a truly eccentric character. Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is a high-school outcast in every sense of the word. More interested in playing tetherball by himself and drawing pictures of his favorite animal, the ""liger"" (a combination of a lion and a tiger), Napoleon is ignored by everyone in his tiny hometown of Preston, Idaho. At home, things aren't much better. His uber-nerd older brother Kip and ultra-vain Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) are too busy with their own obsessions to give Napoleon the time of day. It isn't until a new student, Pedro, arrives that Napoleon finds friendship and performs an act of brave defiance that makes him a true hero. Written by Hess and his wife Jerusha, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE masterfully captures the awkwardness of high school without succumbing to condescension. Most of this can be attributed to Heder, who steps into Napoleon's moon boots with a jaw-dropping flawlessness. The rest of the cast is just as natural, underplaying their roles and letting the comedy unfold without forcing any of the jokes. This is also one of the most unusual movies ever to be told on film.

Well, its not a masterpiece, but it delivers a lot of laughs with unknown actors, with good acting and poking fun at elements of American society that are never touched in most movies. The critiques some reviewers give are true: it has no plot, and the characters are all dimwits. But that doesn't mean it isn't hilarious. I won't badmouth the people who hated it, because my wife is one of them. This movie requires a certain sense of humor. If you have my wife's sense of humor, and think Shrek is really funny (I watched the entire Shrek 2 movie plus the DVD extras, and I think I laughed twice), then you won't appreciate this film. If you like silly/quirky humor like me, you will probably laugh a lot with this film. I like comedies that are silly, quirky and relatively clean. Some that come to mind are Airplane!, Three Amigos! and The Emperor's New Groove. If ridiculousness makes you laugh, there is plenty here. Rent it first, then if you like it, buy it to encourage the filmmakers to produce more. As for the acting, those who say these guys can't act somehow don't seem to realize that these actors are not the dopey people they seem to be in the movie. It takes talent to pull this off. These are not over-the-top Jim Carrey performances. These characters are completely believable, and I don't laugh at them, as one reviewer suggests, out of any sense of superiority, but because the things they do and say are so ridiculous and at the same time believable. I would eat lunch with Napoleon and Pedro any day, and I was never a nerd. Classic moments include Pedro shaving his head one afternoon when he realizes that his hair is making him hot, then realizing that his chances of winning the student body president spot will be hurt by his bald dome, so he gets a girl at school to find him a wig. The way these characters approach the whole ridiculous situation in a totally matter-of-fact, deadpan way is what makes it funny. They don't appear to see anything funny here. They're just reacting the best they know how to their circumstances. Most comedies, on TV and in the movies, are very predictable, with cute jokes and lots of grinning at the camera. If that's American comedy, this is the anti-comedy, about awkward people dealing with awkward circumstances in what seems to them a very logical way. I still love my wife, and she still loves me. Different people find different kinds of things funny. It's good to know there are a lot of others out there who enjoy this kind of more subtle but much more hilarious comedy.",4,"I loved it, my wife hated it.

628670,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JNBQ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a hard movie to describe. It's sort of a teen comedy, but it's not the average teen comedy (especially one produced in part by MTV). There aren't many side-splitting one-liners or over-the-top-gross out gags. The foulest word in the film is either ""freaking"" or ""crap"". The only physical violence in the movie is done by high school bullies or a local martial arts master. There isn't any sex (heck there's hardly any sexual innuendo). The movie doesn't even really have a point.Yet, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE works and works exceedingly well. It's a hilarious movie filled with some extremely memorable characters. The characters are quirky and filled with foibles. Yet, bizarre as they appear, they are so realistic it's uncanny. Who doesn't know somebody like Uncle Rico? Had my maternal grandmother lived long enough, I bet she would have spent her weekends riding an ATV. Anybody else know somebody who thinks selling ""tupperware"" is a ""real job""? The characters in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE are people sliced out of the real-life heart of America.The story of the movie resolves around high schooler, Napoleon Dynamite. He has a 32 year-old brother, Kip, who sits around at home talking to girls on the internet 4-6 hours a day. The brothers live with their Grandma, who sneaks out to do extreme sports with her friends. Grandma gets hurt 4-wheeling on some sand dunes and Uncle Rico is sent to ""help"" the brothers while Granny recovers. Rico still lives in 1982, just before the big high school football game when the coach didn't put him in and they lost. There's a girl at school named Deb who runs her own photography studio who has a major crush on Napoleon, though he doesn't figure it out for the longest time. Napoleon's best friend is a recent immigrant student named Pedro. Pedro decides he wants to run for class president and the rest of the movie revolves around Pedro's campaign and what Napoleon does to help his friend.The actors in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE were pretty-much no names at the time the movie originally came out (Haylie Duff, sister to Hillary was, perhaps the biggest name at the time). Jon Heder, Tina Majorino (who played the girl with the map on her back in WATERWORLD), Aaron Ruell, Jon Gries, and Efren Ramirez are all excellent in their roles. In lesser skilled actors, their roles could have been spoofy, cheesy, or over-the-top. Instead, they grind their characters to reality.The movie has a lot of great scenes and lines and is destined to become one of the most quoted movies of all time (right up with THE PRINCESS BRIDE, TOMMY BOY, and STAR WARS). The movie also boasts a delightful soundtrack that includes everything from ""Time After Time"" to the ""A-Team Theme"" to ""I Want Candy"".

He befriends a new kid Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) and together they form a union that takes them into the political arena, running for school president against the most popular girl, Summer Wheatly (Haylie Duff). But Napoleon must also deal with his missing Grandmother (Sandy Martin), his nerdier brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and his haphazardly enterprising Uncle Rico (Jon Gries). With a subdued laugh a minute Napoleon's life is revealed with a bang.This little film may seem rather dull at first but once the Quaalude induced dark humor of the title character makes his point you will beg for more. Jon Heder is absolutely convincing as the buck toothed, pale and athletically inept Dynamite, just looking at him doing nothing will begin the giggles! Along with Aaron Ruell and Jon Gries you can't ask for a better comedic team to marvel at. Gries gets the gist of the cool nerd down, spending most of his time trying to be attractive but falling far short while Ruell is at an even tie with Heder for who plays the perfect outcast. Under all the humor of course lies the dark life of someone who doesn't ""fit-in"" and in a casual way the filmmakers divulge this side of life without making it so harsh as to make a definite statement, although the point is made within the blast that is Napoleon.

628679,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B00005JNBQ,Wanda B. Red,"[11, 12]","*Napoleon Dynamite* gives the impression of plotlessness. Don't be fooled. The languid spiritlessness of the acting is a trick -- a kind of brilliant filmic *trompe l'oeils*. Underneath it all, the movie has the tremendous energy suggested by its title character's name.Even on a kind of literal level, really a lot is happening on screen: Young Napoleon's grandma breaks her coccyx, leaving Napoleon and his dysfunctional older brother Kip under the care of their even more dysfunctional Uncle Rico, who is so desperate to re-enact (with a different ending) an ill-fated football match from his own high school days that he purchases a time machine over the internet. Napoleon makes a new friend at school (the remarkably charming Pedro, played by Efren Ramirez), whose plans to run for school president are disrupted by a hot flash that causes him to shave his head.That's just the beginning, but it serves to make the point. The pace of the movie never flags, which increases the pleasure of watching it. While the time machine, of course (and quite amusingly), fails to work, the movie does instruct us in the possibilities of happy endings. And that's all I'm going to say about that.But the real pleasure, of course, comes from the hilarious disconnect between the affect of the actors and the situations in which they find themselves. Visually, the sense of disassociation is an aspect of the relentlessly ordinary and dry landscape and architecture; scenes are short and sometimes purposely confusing until later explanations emerge. Overall, the film's disciplined disengagement both accurately portrays the painful discomfort of adolescence, sweetly represented here as a period of tremendous latency. It also reflects a more profound reality that afflicts all of us. Mundane reality can give the most sophisticated and world-weary human the sense that all of life is just high school over and over again. ND gets at that insight.As a result -- and this is most important --because the film so adroitly manipulates the distance between experience and response, it is also very funny. I saw this film on my DVD player, but I've heard that the original audiences in the theaters were in stitches.And the dance scenes, managed with weirdly compelling elegance by Jon Heder, are also worth the price of admission.

The plot is non-existent, the characters are cartoonish clich&eacute;s and the production looks like it was thrown together during a weekend.  But with that said, I must say I enjoyed ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and have found myself laughing with friends over some of the more memorable scenes for the last several days.  The film is like that annoying hangnail that won't go away.  You can't stop playing with it, even though it bleeds when you tug at it.Napoleon Dynamite's title character exists in all high schools across the country.  He lives in his own world of mythological drawings and ninja gear.  His reality grows from a healthy imagination and a way of coping with the daily attacks from the ""cool kids"" and his inescapable existence on the outside of social circles.  The portrayal of a social outcast is so genuine, it at times becomes uncomfortable to watch, as viewers will see how easily a character like Napoleon could end up becoming a Columbine-like killer.A bold choice by writer/director Jared Hess is to refrain from making Napoleon into a hero.  Most often compared to characters in ""Revenge of the Nerds"", Napoleon isn't given a triumphant conclusion where the school realizes he was cool all along.  The film lacks sentimentality in this respect and appears to be the product of individuals who have experienced alienation first hand.The emphasis placed on a realistic portrayal of a ""loser"" also helps build most of the humor in the film.  Napoleon is so consistently bizarre and socially inept that viewers can't help laughing at him (even though we all want him to succeed).

I mean I totally loved last year's Pieces of April, because the story and the cast touched me a great deal. So with this movie, I found it to be quite enjoyable, because the characters are well written, and the jokes worked. It's a movie that I can relate to, because I have been in Pedro and Napolean's shoes in high school as a outcast.Napolean is a wierd and corky on the outside, but he's very sweet and kind on the inside. Nobody wants to be his friend, and he eventually became Pedro's(a Mexican immigrant) best friend, and he helped him run for President in school! A lot of funny things happen in the process of the campaign, and it was great when Napolean does his skit on stage. He danced with a Michael Jackson style to a song that stole the audiences' hearts and votes.Napolean eventually falls in love with the sweet girl in school, and Pedro won the election. His friend found his soul mate named La Sofauwnduh, a sexy and sultry Black girl. His pathetic uncle who sells breast enhancement products also found the love of his life. So in the end, everyone is happy.This movie is made to look like a home video, but it's  very good for a indie-film. And if you liked Ghost World(Thora Birch and Scarlette Johanson), you'll definitely love Napolean Dynamite(Jon Heder)!",4,He ain't your typical boy-next-door.,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,1407,"['had', 'hesitated', 'seeing', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'film', 'known', 'actors', 'mean', 'totally', 'loved', 'last', 'year', 'Pieces', 'April', 'story', 'cast', 'touched', 'great', 'deal', 'So', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'jokes', 'worked', 'movie', 'can', 'relate', 'have', 'been', 'Pedro', 'Napolean', 'shoes', 'high', 'school', 'outcast.Napolean', 'wierd', 'corky', 'outside', 'very', 'sweet', 'kind', 'inside', 'Nobody', 'be', 'friend', 'eventually', 'became', 'Pedro', 'Mexican', 'immigrant', 'best', 'friend', 'helped', 'run', 'President', 'school', 'lot', 'funny', 'things', 'happen', 'process', 'campaign', 'was', 'great', 'when', 'Napolean', 'skit', 'stage', 'danced', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'style', 'song', 'stole', 'audiences', 'hearts', 'votes.Napolean', 'eventually', 'love', 'sweet', 'girl', 'school', 'Pedro', 'won', 'election', 'friend', 'found', 'soul', 'mate', 'named', 'La', 'Sofauwnduh', 'sexy', 'sultry', 'Black', 'girl', 'pathetic', 'uncle', 'who', 'breast', 'enhancement', 'products', 'also', 'found', 'love', 'life', 'So', 'end', 'everyone', 'happy.This', 'movie', 'made', 'look', 'home', 'video', 'very', 'good', 'indie-film', 'liked', 'Ghost', 'World', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Scarlette', 'Johanson', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'love', 'Napolean', 'Dynamite', 'Jon', 'Heder']",Napoleon Dynamite

It has no plot, the pacing is slow, the characters are stranger than strange, and there is absolute ZERO point to the overall experience.  That being said, it's one of those ""funny because it is stupid"" type of movies, and should be watched if only to understand why EVERYONE in 2004 was wearing ""Vote for Pedro"" t-shirts.For a basic plot summary...oh, wait...!  Basically, this movie follows the utterly random exploits of Napolean (Jon Heder), Kip (Aaron Ruell), Pedro (Efran Ramirez), Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), & Deb (Tina Majorino).  There really is nothing else to say.Like I said, I don't see how anyone can sit down and watch this movie and really, really like it.  It's just too pointless and stupid for that type of viewing.  Instead, you'll just find yourself chuckling at that very stupidity (which can only go so far, of course, but does produce a number of quote-worthy and memorable cinematic moments).In terms of the ""big picture"", I don't quite understand why ""Napolean Dynamite"" has become such a cult phenomenon.  I can see why it may appeal to junior-high clientele (what with its juvenile humor and loner/nerd characters), but other than that it just doesn't work on a higher level.I think, in the end, this movie is a rare example of a really bad movie catching lightning in a bottle for some ephemeral reason, becoming a cult classic along the way.

This was the most boring movie I have ever seen.The plot: An outsider meets the new kid at school and decides to help him run for class president.All of my friends at school talked about how funny it was, so since it had such a excellent reputation, I decided to check it out.You wait for something to actually happen, but honestly, nothing ever does. The dialogue is terrible, the acting is terrible. Only watch this movie if you have a couple of hours that you want to waste, and can't think of anything else that would be more entertaining such as this.This is a movie that has always sucked, not before every american teenager decided to quote it, or after everyone knew where the line ""GIMME SOME OF YOUR TATER TOTS!!!!!!"" originated from. Not because it has been over-quoted big-time, but because it has no plot or interesting dialogue whatsoever. The movie has no point, except maybe to top Pulp Fiction in being the most misquoted movie ever. The difference is, Pulp Fiction doesn't suck.For some reason, all of the 'goth' and 'emo' kids like this movie and idolize it. Not because they thought it was funny, but because their friend thought it was funny.I'd like someone to explain to me what the hell is so funny about some kid who talks like he's someone's bi*ch? And even if it were funny, why would it be funny when you say it? Well, its not. Almost every review on here that is for Napoleon Dynamite includes the words ""frickin'"" ""gosh"", or ""sweet!"". I would rather be blasted in the face with a shotgun loaded with Al Gore's semen than listen to another one of these horrible renditions of this shi*ty movie.Oh look, the guy needs chapstick! Call everyone! This movie needs to be seen over and over and over!Why don't you obsessed fans just break down and stalk the mediocre actor who played Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder is his name!) so you can ask him to do the lines over and over for you so you don't have to blather it off to everyone you meet?Seriously, this sh*t needs to end. I'm so sick of this movie. Shi*ty only half describes it. Take sh*t, add a baboon's ass, and multiply by Michael Moore's weight, and the product is Napoleon Dynamite.Kid1: Hey! Guess what I got?

I find myself in the former, because this movie is easily summed up in one word: Random. Yes, random... I wonder how it was thought up but I find it rather brilliant. So what if MTV Films was a part of this, it's a great movie. I even find people hating this movie quoting it, which is something that is pretty interesting.If you're looking for a meaningful movie though, you'll be dissapointed. There is like no real point to the movie, although I find that to be part of what's so great. The title character doesn't reveal it, but he's quite skillful: Good artist, dancer, and used it as part of the support to vote for Pedro, someone he had met from his school when he had first came to the school. A part of this movie involved with Napoleon & Pedro is in my title of this review.He lives with two people: his computer-loving cousin who is almost thirty and his total jerk uncle. The former character falls in love with a woman, Lafawnda, and the latter tried giving friend Deb some shampoo, which dissapoints her, although they do end up doing a dance together for the prom.He busts his moves more than anything for the class president thing, which resulted in Pedro's victory. It is part of what's really cool, I thought, along with a speech saying that ""all of your wildest dreams will come true"". I mean, who wouldn't vote for that.The greatest thing though about this movie is that it's like a home-made video in many ways, although the whole thing is completely acted. This low-budgetness kind of makes it the great movie it is as it has little to do with its visuals but with its storyline/plot.
