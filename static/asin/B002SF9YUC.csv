Marold""","[4, 4]","As Alistair Cook explains in the introduction, this less than 90 minute production eliminates the major subplot involving the Earl of Gloucester and his two sons, Edmund and Edgar. Cook says the subplots were added to pad out a play to stretch to almost four hours, and give the principle actors a rest. What we notice, however, is that by removing that time, Lear's descent into madness goes far more quickly than we see in the full length play.When the play opens, it seems wooden, and Welles seems to lack animation, on a throne and the camera drawn back. Business seems simplified, as all three daughters are present on stage with the opening, all in a neat row. It is only after the first act that we see a far more animated Lear, even more so than those of Lawrence Olivier and Ian McKellen. This is where the biggest difference between the production custom made for TV differs from the productions translated from live stage to the studio. Between Welles and Peter Brook, who is credited with the adaptation, much better use is made of close-ups of Welles face, and he uses that to great advantage. This production also uses more realistic scenery and costuming of the Elizabethan times.I always pay special attention to the role of the fool in ""Lear"". It seems to be the second best part, especially when well played. And it always seems well played. The fool in this production is Alan Badel, who does not have a long list of movie or TV credits; however he often played leads in Shakespeare on the stage. His fool here is as good or better than the other two I have recently seen, augmented by camera work which was well adapted to TV.Near the end, during Lear's madness on the heath and on to Dover, the production seems to be especially careful with Welles aging abilities, as he loses practically none of his clothing, where in other productions, especially with McKellen, Lear ends up virtually naked. That is made up somewhat by the camera's paying close attention to Welles face and his expressions, which he uses to good purpose.The TV direction is good, but missteps now and then, as the backs of actors heads block others' faces. It appears the original was recorded on kinescope, which is virtually always grainy. Of course, it is also in black and white.Overall, of the three recorded productions I have seen, I still prefer the McKellen for the best Lear (with Sylvester McCoy as the fool) but the Olivier version (with John Hurt as the fool) for most other aspects.",4,"Not complete play, but very good for TV",1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,2489,"['Alistair', 'Cook', 'introduction', 'less', '90', 'minute', 'production', 'major', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Earl', 'Gloucester', 'two', 'sons', 'Edmund', 'Edgar', 'Cook', 'subplots', 'were', 'added', 'pad', 'out', 'play', 'stretch', 'almost', 'four', 'hours', 'give', 'principle', 'actors', 'rest', 'What', 'notice', 'however', 'removing', 'time', 'Lear', 'descent', 'madness', 'far', 'more', 'quickly', 'see', 'full', 'length', 'play', 'wooden', 'Welles', 'lack', 'animation', 'throne', 'camera', 'drawn', 'back', 'Business', 'simplified', 'three', 'daughters', 'are', 'present', 'stage', 'opening', 'neat', 'row', 'only', 'first', 'act', 'see', 'far', 'more', 'animated', 'Lear', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'where', 'biggest', 'difference', 'production', 'custom', 'made', 'TV', 'differs', 'productions', 'translated', 'live', 'stage', 'studio', 'Between', 'Welles', 'Peter', 'Brook', 'who', 'credited', 'adaptation', 'much', 'better', 'use', 'made', 'close-ups', 'Welles', 'face', 'great', 'advantage', 'production', 'also', 'more', 'realistic', 'scenery', 'costuming', 'Elizabethan', 'times.I', 'always', 'pay', 'special', 'attention', 'role', 'fool', 'Lear', 'be', 'second', 'best', 'part', 'especially', 'when', 'well', 'played', 'always', 'well', 'played', 'fool', 'production', 'Alan', 'Badel', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'long', 'list', 'movie', 'TV', 'credits', 'however', 'often', 'played', 'leads', 'Shakespeare', 'stage', 'fool', 'here', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'other', 'two', 'have', 'recently', 'seen', 'augmented', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'well', 'adapted', 'TV.Near', 'end', 'Lear', 'madness', 'heath', 'Dover', 'production', 'be', 'especially', 'careful', 'Welles', 'aging', 'abilities', 'practically', 'none', 'clothing', 'where', 'other', 'productions', 'especially', 'McKellen', 'Lear', 'up', 'virtually', 'naked', 'made', 'up', 'somewhat', 'camera', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'Welles', 'face', 'expressions', 'good', 'purpose.The', 'TV', 'direction', 'good', 'missteps', 'now', 'then', 'backs', 'actors', 'heads', 'block', 'others', 'original', 'was', 'recorded', 'kinescope', 'virtually', 'always', 'grainy', 'course', 'also', 'black', 'white.Overall', 'three', 'recorded', 'productions', 'have', 'seen', 'still', 'prefer', 'McKellen', 'best', 'Lear', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'fool', 'Olivier', 'version', 'John', 'Hurt', 'fool', 'most', 'other', 'aspects']",N/A

Still, there are scenes that convey the play's meanings more straightforwardly and clearly than any you will fine in later filmizations.  The crucial opening scene, for example, effectively and efficiently sets up the play in a manner that students immediately grasp.

1286675,A3C4I8X6V1RRGC,B002SF9YUC,Steven Capsuto,"[16, 17]","This is an effective, minimalist, abridged staging of Shakespeare's tragedy, with a thirty-something Orson Welles in the lead. Peter Brook's direction is fine and the cast is solid. Unlike the old VHS release, this DVD contains the entire broadcast, including Alistair Cooke's introductory remarks (but minus the commercials). The extras were a pleasant surprise.The quality of the video transfer is slightly disappointing. I suspect this is an old transfer, perhaps even the one used twenty years ago in the VHS release.The image is soft and flickery, and the movement of the characters on screen is more juddery and riddled with momentary double-exposures than you usually see in modern transfers from 1950s kinescopes. Compare the main feature on this disc against the much cleaner and more watchable images in the extras (also taken from ""Omnibus"" kinescopes) and you'll see what I mean. And I can't believe they didn't touch out those great big cue spots at the end of the reel. That would have been so easy to fix!Despite this, I enjoy the program.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[53, 53]","E1 Entertainment (formerly Koch Home Video) partnered last year with the Archive of American Television to release some extremely rare television shows from their archives on home video. Nearly all of these shows have not been seen by the public since they were broadcast over 50 years ago! Thanks to both early videotape and Kinescopes (live TV broadcasts preserved on film) we are able to re-live what were originally one-time performances. This DVD is one such event.Actor/Write/Director (and more!) Orson Welles love Shakespeare and mounted many of Shakespeare's classics. In the early days of TV, in the 1950s, Shakespeare was not something the average viewer was expecting to see. And certainly not with the great Welles, who was living in England at that time.TV was still in its infancy then and experimenting with its programming. This was a time when there were fewer distractions and other entertainment options for the American public. So CBS (under William Paley) created a 90-minute ""arts magazine"" to be broadcast on Sunday afternoons - remember there were no regular sports broadcasts then - hosted by Britisher Alistair Cooke. It was called ""Omnibus"". For its third season they came up with a real gem. Welles would make his American TV debut in a 90-minute production of ""King Lear"", directed by the then 29 year old British Director Peter Brook. Brook's wife, Natasha Parry, would play Cordelia. The sponsors would become ""subscribers"" so there would be no commercial breaks. And, the script would be revised - leaving out all the subplots - so the actual production ran only 78 minutes! On October 11, 1953 the show aired. And it has not been since - until this release.E1 has gone the extra step in putting together this package. Preceding the October 11th show we are giving the ""preview"" which aired the week before. To add to the understanding of Shakespeare we are presented with a 10-minute portion of a later Omnibus show where Dr. Frank Baxter (who helped Walt Disney explain science to kids, like me, in the 1950s in ""Our Friend the Atom"") gives the history of the Globe Theater. Another 42-minute bonus is a live remote from 1954 at the Yale Shakespeare Festival and a 43-minute episode from 1955 with drama critic Walter Kerr discussing the staging of Shakespeare's plays.All the prints are in more than acceptable viewing condition and the sound is very good. And all were captured ""live"".This is a must for any Shakespeare fan and should be in every school library's DVD collection. There are more ""Omnibus"" shows coming from the AAT and E1.
