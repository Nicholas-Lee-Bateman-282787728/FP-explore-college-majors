1196762,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001GJ4TUQ,B. E Jackson,"[7, 8]","Contract Killers is definitely an ordinary action movie with a fairly weak storyline, but the storytelling aspect hardly matters when the main focus is on nonstop shooting/killing action.It's about a woman (a pretty darn attractive woman, might I add!) who's framed for murder, so she has to spend the entire movie running from the cops and CIA agents.I like how RIGHT from the very beginning the storyline and the action kicks in.  Don't miss the introduction segment!Of course the movie isn't without its faults, many of which occur during the action segments themselves.  A lot of scenes focus on what I like to call ""camera aimlessness"".  You experience lots of shooting taking place on screen, but the camera then immediately darts in another direction so quickly that you don't actually get to see the shooting scenes themselves, so you end up feeling cheated by them.Also the storytelling has its faults as well, such as the one segment when the woman breaks into a guys room, points a gun directly to his head, and then actually tells the guy not to move because she has to use the bathroom!  She then gets a shower!  They become friends later however.  Still, the guy should have taken off running at that point instead of sitting in bed and actually waiting for the woman to come back out.Anyway, it's a fun little action flick.  These faults don't really hurt the film overall.",4,pretty good action,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,1388,"['Contract', 'Killers', 'definitely', 'ordinary', 'action', 'movie', 'fairly', 'weak', 'storyline', 'storytelling', 'aspect', 'hardly', 'matters', 'when', 'main', 'focus', 'nonstop', 'shooting/killing', 'action.It', 'woman', 'pretty', 'darn', 'attractive', 'woman', 'might', 'add', 'who', 'framed', 'murder', 'spend', 'entire', 'movie', 'running', 'cops', 'CIA', 'agents.I', 'how', 'RIGHT', 'very', 'beginning', 'storyline', 'action', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'introduction', 'segment', 'course', 'movie', ""n't"", 'faults', 'many', 'occur', 'action', 'lot', 'scenes', 'focus', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'camera', 'aimlessness', 'experience', 'lots', 'shooting', 'taking', 'place', 'screen', 'camera', 'then', 'immediately', 'direction', 'so', 'quickly', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'them.Also', 'storytelling', 'faults', 'well', 'such', 'one', 'segment', 'when', 'woman', 'guys', 'room', 'gun', 'directly', 'head', 'then', 'actually', 'guy', 'not', 'move', 'use', 'bathroom', 'then', 'shower', 'become', 'friends', 'later', 'however', 'Still', 'guy', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'off', 'running', 'point', 'instead', 'sitting', 'bed', 'actually', 'waiting', 'woman', 'come', 'back', 'out.Anyway', 'fun', 'little', 'action', 'flick', 'faults', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'hurt', 'film', 'overall']",Contract Killers

1196764,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B001GJ4TUQ,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 0]","The plot for ""Contract Killers"" is pretty standard and you've seen it 100 times before. Highly experienced agent is betrayed by his group and fights his way out. Jason Bourne comes to mind immediately, but this film has more to owe to La Femme Nikita. What sets this film apart from the plethora of action spy thrillers is the poor production values and the relatively unknown cast. Don't get me wrong, unknown casts can add a real sparkle to a film as you can't be sure who will live and who won't, but this assumes that the producers bring something more to the table (e.g., a great script). Unfortunately this film has little to recommend it, apart from the chance to see Nick Mancuso once again.Mancuso is a veteran of more than 100 films and TV movies, including some decent roles in films like 1992s ""Under Siege"" (he plays the sleazy CIA guy), ""Marquis de Sade"" (1996) and ""A Young Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" (1996).  I remember him best from his 1986-7 series ""Sting Ray"". Mancuso plays a sleazy CIA agent out to get a disk from the fleeing female agent played by Frida Farrell.Farrel is a European actress who came to the US in the mid 90s. For her role in this film she won an award as ""Breakthrough Performance"" from the Action on Film International Film festival.Some good supporting work is put in by Rhett Giles, G. Anthony Joseph, and Steve Boergadine, but all their efforts are undercut by the cheap settings and poor production values. Note - anytime a film has 13 people listed as ""producer"", ""co producer"", co executive producer"" and/or ""chief poo bah"" you know you are going to be in trouble.The film is written, directed, and edited by 28 year old Justin Rhodes.

If viewers are interested in action, this film has it, plenty of it, but unfortunately much of what occurs during the action is unclear and viewers may feel that they do not know exactly what is occurring. The plot, as many reviewers point out, is typical Jason Bourne, but very lite. In fact, the action also fits that category. A female contract CIA killer is framed for a murder and uses her well-developed skills to escape capture. While on the run, she discovers that a CIA operative wants to destroy the US government, and gets a disc to prove it. While others may know the answer, I was unable to figure out why the CIA wanted to kill her. I read that some reviewers thought that it was because she ""wanted out.""  I don't know if this is true. I was also unable to discover why she handed over the harmful information to another bad CIA operative.

Then you need characters you actually care about, who grow or develope or disclose something about themselves that's interesting and tied to the plot; not stick figures who recite back stories that are silly and irrelevant and who pretend to chemistry where there is none. And then you need real acting, not robots reciting lines and trying to hit the spots that have been taped down for them too many times. And of course, it helps to have some scenery, lighting and costumes too, but that's not likely in this nickel budget film that tries to pretend it has dollars.

Our hero, an assassin who calls herself Jane, gets involved via a contract she pulled off, and she becomes enraged when she wakes up to find her husband murdered.

Which is to say that they're boring.The plot held a bit of mystery, too bad that mystery was revealed to be a big plate of boring and forgettable. Also, once the mystery was revealed, the movie finally decides to actually race somewhere: the ending.
