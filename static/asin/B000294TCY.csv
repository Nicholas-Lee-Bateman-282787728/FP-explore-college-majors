827568,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B000294TCY,David Anderson,"[1, 1]","""Half-Caste"", released in 2004, is not based on a true story like told on the movie cover.  Rather, a man is telling his story to police officers.  The story explores a group of researchers and filmmakers searching for the ""half-caste"", a legendary creature that thrives off human flesh.  They want to prove that he indeed exists.  As they observe him through time, they realize the mechanisms of this creature.  Through interviews and after-effects, some start believing them.  Therefore, they become increasingly fearful for their lives.  Meanwhile, everybody is a target.It seems like the producers were trying to construct something fresh within the independant film indistry.  Obviously, they didn't succeed.  Instead, the half-caste character compares too much to that of a werewolf.  They should have compiled more original effects of an attack.  However, the anatomy was interesting.  Much of the remaining plot was weak.  They didn't maintain the eye-opening suspense long enough to keep audiences interested throughout.  Many scenes were unpredictable, causing the interest to fade as the film progresses.  Granted, there were some great attention-grabbing scenes that make the horror effect slightly more terrifying.  However, some of them don't fit well with the remainder of the film.  And the distinguishment of the film itself and the film camera in the film fits wonderfully in various scenes.  Sometimes it was overly done.The quality of the performances vary within the actors.  Some give average to good performance while some never sound convincing.  The man sharing his story to the police gives the strongest performance of the cast but never above good.  The chase and the terror scenes are acted well during those certain scenes.  However, the remainder of the film doesn't have any eye-opening performance scenes.Those looking for a quality horror film should avoid ""Half-Caste"".  Somewhat similar horror films ""The Howling"" (1981) and ""Wolf"" (1994) are better recommendations as they shall please their audiences.",2,Not Quite Half,1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,2039,"['Half-Caste', 'released', '2004', 'not', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'movie', 'cover', 'Rather', 'man', 'telling', 'story', 'police', 'officers', 'story', 'group', 'researchers', 'filmmakers', 'searching', 'half-caste', 'legendary', 'creature', 'human', 'flesh', 'want', 'prove', 'indeed', 'observe', 'time', 'realize', 'mechanisms', 'creature', 'interviews', 'after-effects', 'start', 'believing', 'Therefore', 'become', 'increasingly', 'fearful', 'lives', 'Meanwhile', 'everybody', 'target.It', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'construct', 'something', 'fresh', 'independant', 'film', 'indistry', 'Obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'Instead', 'half-caste', 'character', 'too', 'much', 'werewolf', 'should', 'have', 'compiled', 'more', 'original', 'effects', 'attack', 'However', 'anatomy', 'was', 'interesting', 'Much', 'remaining', 'plot', 'was', 'weak', 'did', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'eye-opening', 'suspense', 'long', 'enough', 'keep', 'audiences', 'interested', 'Many', 'scenes', 'were', 'unpredictable', 'causing', 'interest', 'fade', 'film', 'Granted', 'were', 'great', 'attention-grabbing', 'scenes', 'make', 'horror', 'effect', 'slightly', 'more', 'terrifying', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well', 'remainder', 'film', 'distinguishment', 'film', 'film', 'camera', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'various', 'scenes', 'Sometimes', 'was', 'overly', 'done.The', 'quality', 'performances', 'vary', 'actors', 'give', 'average', 'good', 'performance', 'never', 'sound', 'convincing', 'man', 'sharing', 'story', 'police', 'strongest', 'performance', 'cast', 'never', 'above', 'good', 'chase', 'terror', 'scenes', 'are', 'acted', 'well', 'certain', 'scenes', 'However', 'remainder', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'eye-opening', 'performance', 'scenes.Those', 'looking', 'quality', 'horror', 'film', 'should', 'avoid', 'Half-Caste', 'Somewhat', 'similar', 'horror', 'films', 'Howling', '1981', 'Wolf', '1994', 'are', 'better', 'recommendations', 'shall', 'please', 'audiences']",Half-Caste

ANY OTHER MOVIE, get it instead...This is a hard review to write, because I can normally find one or two things in any movie (no matter how bad) that I like.  Take Redneck Zombies for instance.  Bad movie, but some funny stuff in it.Half-Caste is really bad.Imagine the worst reality TV show out there, add a little bit of horror, surrounded by a lot of stupid subplots... and stupid shots...The true horror of this movie is when you eventually drag yourself to the end of it, and you turn back and realize how much time in your life you just lost and you'll never be able to get it back again...

827570,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B000294TCY,Ghoulie Guru,"[1, 1]","In this horrible attempt at a Blair Witch mockumentary, a bunch of people go to Africa to investigate a creature called the Half-Caste. It's pretty obvious that there was no script to speak of, and that everything was improvised. That can work if you have good actors, which this film didn't.This movie tries to gain points for originality by exploring a more obscure myth and an exotic culture. As a result, there are a lot of scenes out in the bush where characters do ""quirky African stuff"" like eating elephant dung. There is also some pretty good footage of lions eating (from a National Geographic perspective) but there's not a single scare in the whole movie.If you've seen Cannibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch Project, this movie will hold no surprises for you, and you can probably watch better lion footage on the Discovery Channel.Definitely a Half- Aste effort.A note to the filmmakers: guys, do us all a favor and next time save the ""How I spent my African Vacation"" home movie for your family and close friends.
