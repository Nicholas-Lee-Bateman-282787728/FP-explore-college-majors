I enjoyed the use of colored lights for healing, electro-magnetic healing and water charging, the fact that the doctor's mother was on a higher plane and his father on a lower one and it is true that those from a higher vibrational plane can lower their vibrations to visit those on lower levels but not the other way around. I learned a lesson myself, sort of a spoiler here: when the doctor was working on the other side, he wanted to keep working, and the spiritual nurse replied in so many words that all good workers must rest, as it's the quality of the work! I have always been a Type A and pushed myself way beyond my limits when doing gymnastics, dance, and working in the medical field with patients, so that line really got my attention. I also know there is a record of everything we have every said, thought, or done, and that the deceased can pick up our thoughts and prayers, and the Catholics have got it so right-please pray for those that have recently crossed over, they need all the help they can to adjust to the other side. I also know that communication is done through thought, at least once you're adjusted. However, from what I saw in the movie, it still seemed to be a somewhat lower plane, and am wondering if the deceased doctor that has channeled so many books has real knowledge of the higher planes if he is still residing on that vibrationial plane? I plan to buy the movie. Told one of my doctors about it and he was anticipating watching it soon. The quality of the picture is great. Only suggestion I have, is I wish that you could pause and read the subtitles, when you pause, the subtitles are partially covered so therefore unreadable (I have to have subtitles, and am very disappointed that even though foreign films are my favorite, that subtitles are not available on other movies-surprised the ADA has not filed a complaint on that!).",5,Watched it again the next day,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,2965,"['Have', 'been', 'study', 'afterlife', 'entire', 'life', 'half', 'century', 'movie', 'would', 'rate', 'being', 'least', '95', '%', 'accurate', 'know', 'have', 'experienced', 'was', 'Spiritualist', 'minister', 'medium', 'became', 'disabled', 'Most', 'interesting', 'concept', 'forgiveness', 'duty', 'help', 'others', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'loved', 'different', 'levels', 'spiritual', 'development', '34', 'balance', '34', 'when', '34', 'body', 'temple', '34', 'abused', 'karmic', 'connection', 'must', 'be', 'paid', 'case', 'type', 'purgatory', 'situation', 'however', 'when', 'sincere', 'prayer', 'help', 'requested', 'heart', 'help', 'always', 'available', 'do', 'believe', '34', 'gluttony', '34', 'listed', 'one', '7', 'deadly', 'sins', 'however', 'never', 'thought', 'actions', 'being', '34', 'suicidal', '34', 'have', 'said', 'friend', 'who', 'pain', 'medications', 'alcohol', 'must', 'have', '34', 'death', 'wish', '34', 'reply', 'being', '34', 'have', 'die', 'something', '34', 'respect', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'considered', '34', 'suicide', '34', 'enjoyed', 'use', 'colored', 'lights', 'healing', 'electro-magnetic', 'healing', 'water', 'charging', 'fact', 'doctor', 'mother', 'was', 'higher', 'plane', 'father', 'lower', 'one', 'true', 'higher', 'vibrational', 'plane', 'can', 'lower', 'vibrations', 'visit', 'lower', 'levels', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'learned', 'lesson', 'sort', 'spoiler', 'here', 'when', 'doctor', 'was', 'working', 'other', 'side', 'wanted', 'keep', 'working', 'spiritual', 'nurse', 'replied', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'good', 'workers', 'must', 'rest', 'quality', 'work', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'Type', 'A', 'pushed', 'way', 'limits', 'when', 'doing', 'gymnastics', 'dance', 'working', 'medical', 'field', 'patients', 'line', 'really', 'got', 'attention', 'also', 'know', 'record', 'everything', 'have', 'said', 'thought', 'done', 'deceased', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'thoughts', 'prayers', 'Catholics', 'have', 'got', 'so', 'right-please', 'pray', 'have', 'recently', 'crossed', 'over', 'need', 'help', 'can', 'adjust', 'other', 'side', 'also', 'know', 'communication', 'done', 'thought', 'least', 'once', ""'re"", 'adjusted', 'However', 'what', 'saw', 'movie', 'still', 'seemed', 'be', 'somewhat', 'lower', 'plane', 'am', 'wondering', 'deceased', 'doctor', 'channeled', 'so', 'many', 'books', 'real', 'knowledge', 'higher', 'planes', 'still', 'residing', 'vibrationial', 'plane', 'plan', 'buy', 'movie', 'Told', 'one', 'doctors', 'was', 'anticipating', 'watching', 'soon', 'quality', 'picture', 'great', 'Only', 'suggestion', 'have', 'wish', 'could', 'pause', 'read', 'subtitles', 'when', 'pause', 'subtitles', 'are', 'partially', 'covered', 'so', 'therefore', 'unreadable', 'have', 'have', 'subtitles', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'even', 'foreign', 'films', 'are', 'favorite', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'available', 'other', 'movies-surprised', 'ADA', 'not', 'filed', 'complaint']",Astral City: A Spiritual Journey

Astral City: A Spiritual Journey is based on a 1944 book titled Nosso Lar by the late Brazilian author Chico Xavier.  I have already watched it twice and intend to eventually purchase the dvd. One of the reasons being is because the film beautifully depicts how a spirit can still grow and change for the positive in the spirit realm. I also like how the narrator (who also plays one of the lead parts in the film) pours his heart in playing a soul who candidly describes both the good and challenging aspects of returning to the true spiritual home.  The characters speak in what I am guessing to be the Portuguese language, but there are English subtitles included in the movie.  This movie has definitely piqued my interest in eventually checking out one of the books by Chico Xavier (sometime within the next  year). Astral City: A Spiritual Journey is best for those who like watching movies set in benevolent spirit realms.

1493826,A31BBNT8C62MLU,B005LYLP8Q,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[3, 3]","Whether the reality after life depicted is ""accurate"" or not, I think this is a good movie, and inspiring.  I don't know whether there's much point in saying ***SPOILER ALERT*** because ALL the reviews are spilling the beans, but what I appreciated so much was the subtlety.  Whatever spiritual persuasion you may be, the lessons the Doctor learned were subtle in the extreme.  Petty irritations, ego and pride, concern about status and outward appearances were shown in small, seemingly insignificant yet profound ways.  For example, in one scene in life the Doctor is annoyed, sigh, but reluctantly sees a woman and her husband at the end of the day without an appointment, SUCH an imposition.  In the afterlife, he avoids the woman again.  Later he learns this woman was so grateful to him for helping her husband that she prayed for him (with utter selflessness), and thanks to that single prayer he was plucked from hellish oblivion and given the chance to repent, be rehabilitated.Whatever your spiritual persuasion, whether the film is ""true"" or not, the stages in the Doctor's spiritual journey are lessons everyone should learn in order to be a better human being and a healthy, happy person, here and now (sort of likeGroundhog Day, come to think of it).  A beautiful film, beautifully filmed, touching, inspiring and thought-provoking, you won't soon forget it.  Bravo!P.S.
