It's about mismatched people falling in love, it's about the tango...Filmed in Paris and Buenos Aires, my favorite scenes are lesson #8 and when she dances with the handsome older man in the club. He's sensational, and I wish we could have seen more of him. Sally Potter is wonderful (see her beautiful &quot;Orlando&quot;), she's a very special talent and as the star of this film she's touching, strong, feminine, and radiant. Pablo Veron ! What a fabulous dancer. If you like any kind of dancing, watch this man. He's perfect for the part and makes the inevitability of her falling for him easy to believe...wouldn't we all ? and oh ! the last kiss...could you die and go to heaven or what ?

She learns the very traditional tango from a young Argentine dancer. Traditional tango is an extremely sexual, sensual dance where the man goes through the steps of seducing and controlling his partner's every move. Remember, the argentine tango has it's roots in the brothels of Argentina and for many years was banned in polite society. By the time the tango reached North America it had gained respectability and risen to a true art dance form. In this film Sally Porter begins to assert the role of a modern liberated woman who is no longer content to be completely directed and controled by the man. Her partner is at first dismayed and angry that she wants to assert herself and their dancing becomes more and more like a battle. The tango becomes a metaphor for a woman's struggle for equality. The dancing alone is enough to highly recommend this film.

Like with Sally's '93 film &quot;Orlando&quot;, Sally has little dialogue but any  words spoken between her and Pablo Veron (the amazing professional  Argentine tanger dancer) is always profound. If this film, rare in its  existance, had been in colour I feel that would have robbed the beauty of  it. It's intense in both the dancing and the relationship between Sally and  Pablo. Here you've got an ordinary looking woman, in her late forties, and  an intensly good looking man, in his mid thirties, falling in love (Though  I admit Sally's got a grace about her few women have). There are no big  explosions or naked paintings (a.k.a. Titanic) but this film has a  genuinous about it.

Potter plays herself, a frustrated director desperately trying to finish a  script she has no faith in. On a research trip to Paris, she sees Veron  dancing the tango and instantly falls in love. She takes up the dance, and  the story follows her around the world as she learns the art of the tango.  The stunning camera work (shot mostly in black and white, but with haunting  colour images as Potter imagines her screenplay coming to life)is  breathtaking. There are so many moments of pleasure in this film: Potter  and Veron dancing the tango along the Seine in Paris, in the rain in  Argentina and in an abandoned barbershop.

This film was an exception. I could forgive its lack of plot, its lifeless acting, its stilted dialogue, and the utter lack of chemistry between Pablo and Sally - but I simply could not forgive the awful dancing. Face it, Potter is a zombie on the dance floor. She has no energy, no spark, no fluidity. Veron had enough verve for the two of them (and it was obvious that the movie was a vehicle for Veron to show off), but that does not compensate for his completely unconvincing dance partner. Why would anyone doing performance tango (which, by the way, absolutely cannot be learned after a lesson in ""walking"" and a trip to Buenos Aires) choose a marionette for a partner? It made no sense. (Well, alright, nothing really made sense in this film.) The one good scene in this film was when Potter goes to Buenos Aires and gets on the floor with a portly older gentleman.
