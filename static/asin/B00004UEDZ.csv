552466,A3TOWO3PUY3DGL,B00004UEDZ,-Ashi-,"[0, 0]","To me, watching this movie is like watching a friend coming out on the screen....  It's believable and it's painful because of that.  If I consideredThe Line of Beautyto be an excellent movie that speaks a broader ""gay experience"", then Edge of Seventeen is a film that speaks to me at a more intimate level.Now here's the review of the movie.  The movie is about a guy called Eric (played by Chris Stafford) who is in a sexual confusion which eventually hurt people who care about him and foremost, himself.  Despite growing up in the 90's, I think many of the growing pain of a homosexual man is still relevant (but given the feedback from some reviews, apparently kids from 2000's aren't going through the same sort of pain as before).  Eric has gone through a lot of stuff I can relate to: expressing himself through fashion and hairdo, feeling lost, enduring indignation with silence (what else could you do?), looking for love from both genders (but only going back to feel lost again).  The movie nailed every important subjects in the process of coming to term of finding self.To those who couldn't find the point of the movie, let me offer this: not everyone can go to one of his parents and just say ""Mom, I'm gay"" without a long process in between.  I don't see the movie as a gay man trying to find love kind of movie, but a movie about a man's process of finding the real him.  Things like experimenting on hair style, putting on make up, going to gay bar, sleeping with guys, sleeping with his best female friend (!)..., etc., were all small details that eventually built up to the final conclusion.I personally feel The Edge of Seventeen to be a very frank story that deserves to be noticed, but Strand Releasing (the publisher of this DVD) did a terrible job at market placement, I think.  I avoided this film because I had judged the movie by its cover....  However, it turned out to be much better than expected.  Like another reviewer mentioned, one may think this is an uplifting movie, but it's not....  I am guessing Strand probably believed marketing the movie this way may boost sale, but it pleases no one.  Honesty sells.  This is not a pastel colored love story, but a brutally honest coming out story, so why disappoint someone who was looking for a Friday fun and turn someone who was looking for a serious love story?  Target the customer correctly, please.To Strand's credit, they generally publish good quality movies.  This and The Mudge Boy both offer stellar acting performance with strong scripts.  Chris Stafford should win an award for his role.  The script is believable and honest.  I didn't expect a good movie when I first started, but it ended up making me insomniac that night because it reached that deep pocket of my life that I thought I had long forgotten.Rated E for Essential.",5,Freightfully Honest,1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,2826,"['watching', 'movie', 'watching', 'friend', 'coming', 'out', 'screen', 'believable', 'painful', 'consideredThe', 'Line', 'Beautyto', 'be', 'excellent', 'movie', 'broader', 'gay', 'experience', 'then', 'Edge', 'Seventeen', 'film', 'more', 'intimate', 'level.Now', 'here', 'review', 'movie', 'movie', 'guy', 'called', 'Eric', 'played', 'Chris', 'Stafford', 'who', 'sexual', 'confusion', 'eventually', 'hurt', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'foremost', 'growing', 'up', '90', 'think', 'many', 'growing', 'pain', 'homosexual', 'man', 'still', 'relevant', 'given', 'feedback', 'reviews', 'apparently', 'kids', '2000', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'same', 'sort', 'pain', 'before', 'Eric', 'gone', 'lot', 'stuff', 'can', 'relate', 'expressing', 'fashion', 'hairdo', 'feeling', 'lost', 'enduring', 'indignation', 'silence', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'do', 'looking', 'love', 'genders', 'only', 'going', 'back', 'feel', 'lost', 'again', 'movie', 'nailed', 'important', 'subjects', 'process', 'coming', 'term', 'finding', 'self.To', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'point', 'movie', 'let', 'offer', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'go', 'one', 'parents', 'just', 'say', 'Mom', ""'m"", 'gay', 'long', 'process', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'gay', 'man', 'trying', 'find', 'love', 'kind', 'movie', 'movie', 'man', 'process', 'finding', 'real', 'Things', 'experimenting', 'hair', 'style', 'putting', 'make', 'up', 'going', 'gay', 'bar', 'sleeping', 'guys', 'sleeping', 'best', 'female', 'friend', 'etc.', 'were', 'small', 'details', 'eventually', 'built', 'up', 'final', 'conclusion.I', 'personally', 'feel', 'Edge', 'Seventeen', 'be', 'very', 'frank', 'story', 'be', 'noticed', 'Strand', 'Releasing', 'publisher', 'DVD', 'did', 'terrible', 'job', 'market', 'placement', 'think', 'avoided', 'film', 'had', 'judged', 'movie', 'cover', 'However', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'one', 'may', 'think', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'not', 'am', 'guessing', 'Strand', 'probably', 'believed', 'marketing', 'movie', 'way', 'may', 'boost', 'sale', 'one', 'Honesty', 'not', 'pastel', 'colored', 'story', 'brutally', 'honest', 'coming', 'out', 'story', 'so', 'why', 'disappoint', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'looking', 'Friday', 'fun', 'turn', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'looking', 'serious', 'love', 'story', 'Target', 'customer', 'correctly', 'please.To', 'Strand', 'credit', 'generally', 'publish', 'good', 'quality', 'movies', 'Mudge', 'Boy', 'offer', 'stellar', 'acting', 'performance', 'strong', 'scripts', 'Chris', 'Stafford', 'should', 'win', 'award', 'role', 'script', 'believable', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'insomniac', 'night', 'reached', 'deep', 'pocket', 'life', 'thought', 'had', 'long', 'forgotten.Rated', 'E', 'Essential']",Edge of Seventeen

This is not a coming-out tale told thru rose-colored glasses. It's not a romance.""Edge of Seventeen"" depicts the coming-out of 17 year old Eric Hunter in Sandusky, OH, in 1984. The cast overall is not as stellar as, say, ""Beautiful Thing"" or ""Lilies,"" or several other very good gay films, but most of them have very minor roles, anyway. Of those that are crucial to the story, Chris Stafford deserves a statuette for his portrayal of Eric, nailing just about every nuance of emotion such a boy would go through, though he has a tendency to giggle at times when I think a soft moan would be more appropriate. Tina Holmes gives a wonderful performance as his steadfast girl friend, Maggie, and Stephanie McVay is excellent as Everymom. Lea Delaria perhaps brings some cachet to the film as a gay icon, but I would have preferred the role to be filled by a non-celebrity. Celebrity actors usually make better contributions to films if they play against type, if they have the acting skills to do it. Andersen Gabrych is creepily perfect as Rod, the college stud who knows Eric is attracted to him before Eric does and intends to use that knowledge to his personal satisfaction in every way he can.The directing, camera work and editing are accomplished if not exciting or groundbreaking. The 80s was a nothing decade for me musically, so the soundtrack does nothing for me.There are some rather explicit scenes, though nothing XXX; they will probably be a little discomforting for some straights and some gays, tho for different reasons.Unlike most gay films, the bad guys in ""Edge of Seventeen"" are not the homophobes, who are very inconsequential, nor a father who is unsupportive, nor any of the other usual suspects, but various gay characters, all too true to life, whom Eric encounters in his ""Summer of '84."" Number 1, of course, is Rod ('wham, bam, thank you little boy'). Number 2 is the predator who hits on Eric on his first visit to a gay bar ('wham, bam, slurp, ""Whatever""'). Then there are the various jaded queens at the bar, latter day 'Boys in the Band' wannabees who can't wait to have Eric find out what 'It's Really All About, sweetie.' We all know all these characters.Roger Ebert stupidly concludes Eric can't wait to be a slut. But Ebert is right that the film doesn't present a single positive male homosexual character.Nevertheless Eric survives his rites of initiation into the gay bar scene, and seems to be stabilizing happily at the end, which is otherwise a bit vague and cliche.The scenes in which Eric struggles with coming out to his Mom and then does are heart-rending and among the most moving in gay cinema, as is his coming out to Maggie.Despite my minor quibbles, I put this film on my very short list of 5-Star rated, excellent gay films. It is not to be missed. I will be looking forward to seeing more of Chris Stafford in future films, even if they're not about gay subjects.",5,Not to be missed,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,3017,"['very', 'powerful', 'gay', 'coming-out', 'film', 'others', 'directness', 'simplicity', 'honesty', 'not', 'coming-out', 'tale', 'told', 'thru', 'rose-colored', 'glasses', 'not', 'romance', 'Edge', 'Seventeen', 'coming-out', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Eric', 'Hunter', 'Sandusky', 'OH', '1984', 'cast', 'overall', 'not', 'as', 'stellar', 'say', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'Lilies', 'several', 'other', 'very', 'good', 'gay', 'films', 'most', 'have', 'very', 'minor', 'roles', 'anyway', 'are', 'crucial', 'story', 'Chris', 'Stafford', 'statuette', 'portrayal', 'Eric', 'nailing', 'just', 'nuance', 'emotion', 'boy', 'would', 'go', 'tendency', 'giggle', 'times', 'when', 'think', 'soft', 'moan', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Tina', 'Holmes', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'steadfast', 'girl', 'friend', 'Maggie', 'Stephanie', 'McVay', 'excellent', 'Everymom', 'Lea', 'Delaria', 'perhaps', 'cachet', 'film', 'gay', 'icon', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'role', 'be', 'filled', 'non-celebrity', 'Celebrity', 'actors', 'usually', 'make', 'better', 'contributions', 'films', 'play', 'type', 'have', 'acting', 'skills', 'do', 'Andersen', 'Gabrych', 'creepily', 'perfect', 'Rod', 'college', 'stud', 'who', 'Eric', 'attracted', 'Eric', 'use', 'knowledge', 'personal', 'satisfaction', 'way', 'directing', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'are', 'accomplished', 'not', 'exciting', 'groundbreaking', '80s', 'was', 'nothing', 'decade', 'musically', 'soundtrack', 'nothing', 'me.There', 'are', 'rather', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'XXX', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'little', 'discomforting', 'straights', 'gays', 'tho', 'different', 'reasons.Unlike', 'most', 'gay', 'films', 'bad', 'guys', 'Edge', 'Seventeen', 'are', 'not', 'homophobes', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'inconsequential', 'father', 'who', 'unsupportive', 'other', 'usual', 'suspects', 'various', 'gay', 'characters', 'too', 'true', 'life', 'whom', 'Eric', 'Summer', ""'84"", 'Number', '1', 'course', 'Rod', ""'wham"", 'bam', 'thank', 'little', 'boy', 'Number', '2', 'predator', 'who', 'Eric', 'first', 'visit', 'gay', 'bar', ""'wham"", 'bam', 'slurp', 'Then', 'are', 'various', 'jaded', 'queens', 'bar', 'latter', 'day', 'Band', 'wannabees', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'have', 'Eric', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Really', 'sweetie', 'know', 'characters.Roger', 'Ebert', 'stupidly', 'Eric', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'slut', 'Ebert', 'right', 'film', ""n't"", 'present', 'single', 'positive', 'male', 'homosexual', 'character.Nevertheless', 'Eric', 'rites', 'initiation', 'gay', 'bar', 'scene', 'be', 'stabilizing', 'happily', 'end', 'otherwise', 'bit', 'vague', 'cliche.The', 'scenes', 'Eric', 'coming', 'out', 'Mom', 'then', 'are', 'heart-rending', 'most', 'moving', 'gay', 'cinema', 'coming', 'out', 'Maggie.Despite', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'put', 'film', 'very', 'short', 'list', '5-Star', 'rated', 'excellent', 'gay', 'films', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'Chris', 'Stafford', 'future', 'films', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'gay', 'subjects']",Edge of Seventeen

552473,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B00004UEDZ,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[24, 28]","Every now and then a film comes along that captivates you from start to finish - ""Torch Song Trilogy"" was one of the first that did that for me.  ""Edge of Seventeen"" did it again.  Maybe it's because I was 18 going on 19 when this film, set in 1984, took place.  Like Eric from Sandusky Ohio, I too grew up in a small town along the New Jersey shore.  And like the film's star, I too listened to music of the 80's and knew I was indeed ""different"".You need to buy or at least rent this film if you are male, especially a gay male, a woman, especially a woman who is the friend of a gay man, you're someone in your 20's, 30's or 40's and/or you ever knew someone that was gay.  It's also a great film if you ever struggled with who you are, where you came from or faced discrimination in your life for any reason.  I think that covers just about everyone now.Films like this are rare.  And even more rare, is the fact that none of the major networks will even probably consider carrying it - what a loss.  I'm sure if the film centered on a heterosexual male, the closeted programming people in Hollywood would jump on it.  Funny how Hollywood works, for if it weren't for so many gay and lesbian actors and actresses, where would Hollywood be? But I digress.As for the film?  It follows 17-year old Eric as he deals with his sexuality.  He lives in at home with Mom, Dad and his brothers.  He listens to music by Annie Lennox and Bronski Beat, songs he can relate too.  He has a dear female friend who, unfortunately has feelings for him that he'll never truly have for her.  Eric's room is adorned with posters of Billy Idol (I think I had the same one in my college dorm), and a photo of New Yorks City's skyline, eerily showing the World Trade Center towers.  Eric dreamed of attending music school in New York City.  His struggles in school, at work, and in relationships are near and dear to us all.  Like so many of us during the ""coming out"" years, Eric encounters the same prejudices, the same stereotypes and the same hurt.  And like anyone who has ever loved or been loved, Eric deals with the challenges of any relationship as it relates to the heart, and sex.  And tries to understand the difference.  What is most interesting as I watched this film (again set in 1984), is the parallels to today, nearly 20 years later.  Is it really that much easier for a 17 year old youth to come out to family and close friends without fear of losing those close to him or her?The film runs 1 minute shy of 100 minutes.  And if you edited out about 9 of those minutes (tops), and a few words, the film is ready for television, not that you'll probably ever see on anything other then Bravo or IFC.  I honestly found the film riveting, finding myself in his shoes on so many occasion's.  We need films like this to remind our youth that they are not alone, and they will be ok, no matter who they are.To be fair, a good review should always include some critique, if one is so deserving.  The ending, wrapped up in about 15 minutes includes Eric coming out to his Mom, and visiting the local nightclub, where his friend Angie (played by Lea Delaria), dedicates a song to her special friend.  The ending was a little too Brady Bunch sitcom.  But I won't let it take away from an otherwise excellent film, which earns 5 stars in my book.",5,"A Riveting Portrayal of Coming Out, Set in the 1980's",1039824000,"12 14, 2002",2002,3334,"['now', 'then', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'Torch', 'Song', 'Trilogy', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'did', 'Edge', 'Seventeen', 'did', 'again', 'Maybe', 'was', '18', 'going', '19', 'when', 'film', 'set', '1984', 'took', 'place', 'Eric', 'Sandusky', 'Ohio', 'too', 'grew', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'Jersey', 'shore', 'film', 'star', 'too', 'listened', 'music', '80', 'knew', 'was', 'indeed', 'different', '.You', 'need', 'buy', 'least', 'rent', 'film', 'are', 'male', 'especially', 'gay', 'male', 'woman', 'especially', 'woman', 'who', 'friend', 'gay', 'man', ""'re"", 'someone', '20', '30', '40', 'and/or', 'ever', 'knew', 'someone', 'was', 'gay', 'also', 'great', 'film', 'ever', 'struggled', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'came', 'faced', 'discrimination', 'life', 'reason', 'think', 'just', 'everyone', 'now.Films', 'are', 'rare', 'even', 'more', 'rare', 'fact', 'none', 'major', 'networks', 'will', 'even', 'probably', 'consider', 'carrying', 'what', 'loss', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', 'centered', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'closeted', 'programming', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'jump', 'Funny', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'many', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'actors', 'actresses', 'where', 'would', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'digress.As', 'film', '17-year', 'old', 'Eric', 'sexuality', 'home', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'brothers', 'music', 'Annie', 'Lennox', 'Bronski', 'Beat', 'can', 'relate', 'too', 'dear', 'female', 'friend', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'feelings', ""'ll"", 'never', 'truly', 'have', 'Eric', 'room', 'adorned', 'posters', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'think', 'had', 'same', 'one', 'college', 'dorm', 'photo', 'New', 'Yorks', 'City', 'skyline', 'eerily', 'showing', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'towers', 'Eric', 'dreamed', 'attending', 'music', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'struggles', 'school', 'work', 'relationships', 'are', 'near', 'dear', 'so', 'many', 'coming', 'out', 'years', 'Eric', 'same', 'prejudices', 'same', 'stereotypes', 'same', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'loved', 'been', 'loved', 'Eric', 'deals', 'challenges', 'relationship', 'heart', 'sex', 'tries', 'understand', 'difference', 'What', 'most', 'interesting', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'set', '1984', 'parallels', 'today', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'later', 'really', 'much', 'easier', '17', 'year', 'old', 'youth', 'come', 'out', 'family', 'close', 'friends', 'fear', 'losing', 'close', 'film', '1', 'minute', 'shy', '100', 'minutes', 'edited', 'out', '9', 'minutes', 'tops', 'few', 'words', 'film', 'ready', 'television', 'not', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'ever', 'see', 'anything', 'other', 'then', 'Bravo', 'IFC', 'honestly', 'found', 'film', 'riveting', 'finding', 'shoes', 'so', 'many', 'occasion', 'need', 'films', 'remind', 'youth', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'will', 'be', 'ok', 'matter', 'who', 'are.To', 'be', 'fair', 'good', 'review', 'should', 'always', 'include', 'critique', 'one', 'so', 'deserving', 'ending', 'wrapped', 'up', 'about', '15', 'minutes', 'Eric', 'coming', 'out', 'Mom', 'visiting', 'local', 'nightclub', 'where', 'friend', 'Angie', 'played', 'Lea', 'Delaria', 'song', 'special', 'friend', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'sitcom', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'take', 'away', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'book']",Edge of Seventeen

552476,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00004UEDZ,D. Litton,"[8, 8]","Perhaps the most intriguing moments in &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot; involve those at an all-night gay bar, where the main character ventures in order to live his lifestyle out in the open, away from all his cumbersome worries of being closeted at home and school. He just dances and laughs the night away, the flashing red and blue lights casting shadows and colors across the floor, symbolizing the ever-difficult journey into the world of open homosexuality.&quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot; is dynamic in the way in which it unfolds, bringing its story to light in so many new and fresh ways. While all of the characters unfold in their own way, the most evolving and moving character is Eric, whose journey down the path of coming out and discovery of his sexual and physical identity set the stage for a heartfelt human drama that will keep you involved throughout. I found myself reminiscing to the times in Eric's life that I, too, lived through, as well as laughing hysterically along with him as he enjoyed his life the only way he knew how. More importantly, I came to realize just how true this movie is, not so much in how Eric lived his life, but his feelings and emotions, and how he deals with them in the course of coming out.As the summer of his junior year begins, Eric has high hopes for his summer. He, along with his best friend Maggie, are both beginning a job at the local fairground restaurant. The job seems rather listless, until Eric meets Rod, the blond hottie who also works at the restaurant, and who makes it no secret that he is gay. At first, Eric seems uncomfortable, yet he warms to Rod's jokes and advances, ultimately leading to a night of passion between the two the last night of their working together. This all goes on within the first half hour, and while it seems a little overwhelming for such a short period of running time, it all makes sense because Eric's experiences are meant to be just that. The rush that he gets from the pace of events will affect him much later into the film.Going back to school provides for nothing but hour upon hour of daydreaming of Rod, which leads Eric to explore his sexuality a little more openly, but only when he begins frequenting an all-night gay bar. One night, after fooling around with a guy in his car, Eric calls Rod, asking him what it all means, and professing what might be the makings of love, only to be shot down by Rod when he confesses that he has gotten back together with his ex. This begins a very devastating journey for Eric, who explores both his attraction for men and for his best friend, Maggie, and learns that he is only lying to himself by denying his same-sex attractions.The film is one for the ages, and it proves this by taking a story that could be placed in any recent time period and placing it in the 80's. The film is truly brilliant in bringing to life the music, the clothing styles, the lifestyles, and every other nuance of this era. The movie is able to achieve its goal in making us feel transported back to that time period, and it also makes itself look like it comes from that time period as well. This only makes it all the more special.The film also creates a well-crafted balance of humor and tension, both sexual and emotional, for Eric. When he first meets Rod, he knows he is attracted to him, and the big question that rises among the audience is, &quot;Will they have sex?&quot; After they do, the next big question comes, and that is whether or not this is going to be a Cinderella ending, where Rod sweeps Eric off his feet and stays with him forever. Unfortunately, or fortunately, however you take it, the rest of the film has much more in store for Eric, and instead of giving him nothing but daydreaming to do for the rest of the running time, he is given a chance to explore more deeply his desires, his fears, and who he knows he is inside.There is only one turnoff for me in this film, and that is some of the strings lefts untied in the end. I advise you to read no further if you have not seen this movie, but if you have, please continue. After Eric comes out to his mother, she leaves the room, but not before hugging him and asking &quot;What did I do wrong?&quot; We never see the two discuss the events of the last year, nor do they ever come to an understanding of one another's feelings about his sexuality, which is a bit of a letdown. Also, Eric and Maggie end up sleeping together, and soon he realizes that he cannot be with her no matter how much he may say he loves her because he cannot deny his attraction to men. She leaves, and they do not speak for the rest of the movie. Do they ever talk to or see each other again? We may never know, unless a sequel is in the works.There is such a terrific amount of acting for this film, and that is what keeps it moving: powerful performances by some of the best actors ever in a movie of this genre. Chris Stafford gives a stunningly powerful performance as Eric Hunter, playing out all of his emotions with believable feeling while never coming off as forced. His acting job tells us as an audience that he is aware of his status in this movie, and is determined to do a good job, with successful results. Andersen Gabrych plays Rod, the blond hottie of Eric's dreams, and while his emotional outwardness for the film is not as important, he still makes his character real. Tina Holmes is striking as Eric's best friend, Maggie, and when it comes time for her performance to really deliver, she does her utmost best in giving us heart and emotion. The comical relief of the film is given us by Lea DeLaria, who plays the group's boss at the restaurant and also becomes a mentor of sorts for Eric. She spans both horizons, playing the clown while also adding wisdom and wit to her words.&quot;Edge of Seventeen,&quot; while being an independent film, has the look and feel of an afterschool special for Showtime or HBO, but it plays itself to be so much more than that. It takes itself very seriously when it needs to, not bogging us down with too much emotion at once, but giving us just enough to make us realize that the story is one that happens to everyday people. Performances add a lot to the heart of the story, if not giving us some eye candy to look at. It will keep you entertained as well as bring back memories for those of us who can relate to Eric and his struggle for his true identity.",4,Hits home!,984873600,"03 18, 2001",2001,6403,"['Perhaps',

Anyway, I can say without doubt that the movie felt realistic and it was not at all exaggerated. The story of Eric trying to understand himself and his feelings, with all the trouble this self-searching can bring along if it's done in an age when you are still so unsure of everything, is probably the ordinary discovery journey a teenager undertakes, gay, lesbian or heterosexual. The second point I like of the movie is that, even if the plot is realistic, it's also romantic. Sure, Eric is not so lucky with his first love, but how many of us can say the same? Rod is a necessary stop in Eric's travel towards adulthood and maybe in retrospective Eric will be happy to have met him. Eric is innocent and romantic, but also a little bit horny, and Rod is a college student who probably doesn't want to commit to anything serious yet. Sure Eric will suffer for this unrequited love, but nothing his teenager heart will not be able to bear.

He has a girl friend who would like the relation to go all the way, but he does not bring it there which makes him start wondering.Then he is thrown into the gay world by accident, the way most things happen in life. His first man is a sweet and maybe slightly weak predator, a senior in his high school, and a colleague at his summer workplace. The young junior falls and the senior goes to college in September. Eric will have to live alone with his recollection, his desire and the demand from his mother and society to have a normal life with a girl friend and all the rest that goes along with it. Maggie will play what she still does not know is a game.Then all that happens is accidental till it becomes a real choice. Later he will run away from a straight party when he is called a queer because he dances in a rather exuberant way. He goes to a gay night club or bar where he meets someone. The next stage later on will be to run after his first male lover and to get it finished physically and emotionally: right through to the end of the physical act and to the final closure of the emotional experience.Then he will try to go back to a normal straight life and have a night with his girl friend, Maggie. But in the morning he will feel no satisfaction, no fulfillment. He will know then lying is no solution and he will move towards telling his mother and then going back to where he finds his full both physical and emotional nourishment.The film is then interesting because it describes the slow change that occurs in Eric with total sympathy and even empathy. Eric is living what practically all human beings have lived or deserve living: the slow awakening of desire and search for satisfaction of that desire, the desire to be appealing to someone else, the desire to answer to the ones who are appealing to him, the desire to feel happy and satisfied when he meets with that mutual appeal which is first of all a strong emotion that becomes a passion. Then the physical act is like natural.This is not typical of gay men, but any man feels that transformation no matter who is the object of the nascent passion. I guess it is also the same thing for women though the film does not insist on the case of the Lesbian friend of Eric's and only shows the deception and frustration of Maggie when she realizes her appeal has been hijacked by Eric.This film insists on the role of the mother that moves from open hostility to acceptance without the know-how required by such a disquieting situation. If the mother accepts her son's choice, she will have to defend him and it when confronted to the dubitative hostility of other parents, not to speak of the open hostility of other teenagers, some school officials, PTA members, church representatives, etc.A good film on the problem and necessity to come out as soon as the appeal starts moving in you, though you need a confident, an accomplice, someone who understands and supports you in that transformation. Coming out is hard.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Admirable though the father figure is slightly weak.,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,3203,"['Film', 'as', 'simple', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'situation', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'common', 'A', 'teenager', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'discovers', 'little', 'little', 'attracted', 'men', 'girl', 'friend', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'relation', 'go', 'way', 'not', 'bring', 'start', 'wondering.Then', 'thrown', 'gay', 'world', 'accident', 'way', 'most', 'things', 'happen', 'life', 'first', 'man', 'sweet', 'maybe', 'slightly', 'weak', 'predator', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'colleague', 'summer', 'workplace', 'young', 'junior', 'falls', 'senior', 'college', 'September', 'Eric', 'will', 'have', 'live', 'alone', 'recollection', 'desire', 'demand', 'mother', 'society', 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'girl', 'friend', 'rest', 'along', 'Maggie', 'will', 'play', 'what', 'still', 'not', 'know', 'game.Then', 'accidental', 'real', 'choice', 'Later', 'will', 'run', 'away', 'straight', 'party', 'when', 'called', 'queer', 'rather', 'exuberant', 'way', 'gay', 'night', 'club', 'bar', 'where', 'someone', 'next', 'stage', 'later', 'will', 'be', 'run', 'first', 'male', 'lover', 'get', 'finished', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'right', 'end', 'physical', 'act', 'final', 'closure', 'emotional', 'experience.Then', 'will', 'try', 'go', 'back', 'normal', 'straight', 'life', 'have', 'night', 'girl', 'friend', 'Maggie', 'morning', 'will', 'feel', 'satisfaction', 'fulfillment', 'will', 'know', 'then', 'lying', 'solution', 'will', 'move', 'towards', 'telling', 'mother', 'then', 'going', 'back', 'where', 'full', 'physical', 'emotional', 'nourishment.The', 'film', 'then', 'interesting', 'slow', 'change', 'Eric', 'total', 'sympathy', 'even', 'empathy', 'Eric', 'living', 'what', 'practically', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'lived', 'deserve', 'living', 'slow', 'awakening', 'desire', 'search', 'satisfaction', 'desire', 'desire', 'be', 'appealing', 'someone', 'else', 'desire', 'answer', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'appealing', 'desire', 'feel', 'happy', 'satisfied', 'when', 'mutual', 'appeal', 'first', 'strong', 'emotion', 'passion', 'Then', 'physical', 'act', 'natural.This', 'not', 'typical', 'gay', 'men', 'man', 'transformation', 'matter', 'who', 'object', 'nascent', 'passion', 'guess', 'also', 'same', 'thing', 'women', 'film', 'not', 'insist', 'case', 'Lesbian', 'friend', 'Eric', 'only', 'deception', 'frustration', 'Maggie', 'when', 'appeal', 'been', 'hijacked', 'Eric.This', 'film', 'insists', 'role', 'mother', 'open', 'hostility', 'acceptance', 'know-how', 'required', 'such', 'disquieting', 'situation', 'mother', 'son', 'choice', 'will', 'have', 'defend', 'when', 'confronted', 'dubitative', 'hostility', 'other', 'parents', 'not', 'speak', 'open', 'hostility', 'other', 'teenagers', 'school', 'officials', 'PTA', 'members', 'church', 'representatives', 'etc.A', 'good', 'film', 'problem', 'necessity', 'come', 'out', 'as', 'soon', 'appeal', 'moving', 'need', 'confident', 'accomplice', 'someone', 'who', 'transformation', 'Coming', 'out', 'hard.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Edge of Seventeen

Michael Click,"[9, 9]","Movie: *****  DVD Quality: *****  DVD Extras: ***Dramas about _Teenage Gays Coming Out Of The Closet!_ are so plentiful, they sometimes run together in my mind.  ""Edge of Seventeen"" is an exception to that statement because it genuinely is an exceptional movie in every way.  The screenplay by Todd Stephens is sensitive and true to life, or rather, many people's lives.  It tells the story of Eric (Chris Stafford), a young man growing up in the small town of Sandusky, Ohio, who is just beginning to grapple with his sexual orientation.  What is so refreshing about the script is that Eric is portrayed as neither a victim nor a hero; he's simply a kid on the cusp of adulthood who is trying to find himself.  Eric is sometimes selfish and thoughtless; other times sweet and naive; occasionally manipulative; but generally a good guy ... in other words: completely human.  That holds true of the other characters in the movie, including Eric's parents who love him dearly but aren't quite sure what to make of his fast-changing moods and appearance; his female best friend (Tina Holmes) who harbors deeper feelings for him; and his new gay ""family"" (headed by Lea DeLaria) who are fiercely supportive, yet sometimes insensitive to where he is at in terms of his coming out process.  Thankfully, Stephens' screenplay remains true to itself right down to the final fadeout and doesn't cop out by trying to wrap everything up into a neat little package; at the end of the movie, there's a definite sense that these characters will continue to live, learn, make mistakes, and thrive.  (Sequel, anyone?)The entire cast is uniformly outstanding.  Chris Stafford embodies Eric in all his complexity; his performance never strikes a false note.  Tina Holmes is amazing as his confused female friend; more than once her face and vocal inflections reminded me of an extremely young Meryl Streep (a high compliment indeed).  Stephanie McVay distinguishes herself as Eric's baffled mother, and Andersen Gabrych is fine as Eric's first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers a troubled heart.  Perhaps best of all is comic Lea DeLaria, who turns in a warm and winning dramatic performance as the Earth Mother whose wisdom and understanding are always available to Eric, regardless of how hard he sometimes pushes her away.The Strand DVD offers a flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio and video.  The somewhat sparse extras are limited to the Theatrical Trailers for ""Edge of Seventeen"" and five other feature films designed to appeal to LGBT audiences.  It would be wonderful to have the additional benefit of cast and crew biographies and filmographies as a reasearch tool for the viewers who want to explore others works by the filmmakers, but this is a small complaint.

552486,AOXX9HZUKLN00,B00004UEDZ,"Jon Rydin ""~Zee MaZteR of Pop Culture~""","[47, 50]","Yes... it's another &quot;coming out&quot; movie. Luckily, this one stands out from the crowd -- thanks to great performances and an honest and sensitive portrayal.It's 1984 in Sandusky, Ohio... 17-year-old Eric (Stafford) finishes his junior year at high school and takes a summer job serving food at the local amusement park, along with his best friend Maggie (Holmes). There he meets openly gay Rod (Gabrych), who sets Eric off on his road to realizing his budding homosexuality.The movie does an excellent job of showing the truthful highs &amp; lows of coming out in your teens. In Eric's discovery, he has his first and several gay sexual experiences (and mistakes that sex for love), goes to his first gay bar, silently deals with the &quot;queer&quot; name calling by his classmates, hides his sexuality from his family, &amp; sleeps with and then alienates his best female friend... all while morphing from a &quot;nerd&quot; into an eccentric dressing, hair-dyed 80's new wave child in his attempt to become individual. The results are honest, funny, heartfelt, and displayed with an unexpected sexual candor.The cast is absolutely fantastic. The real stand-out is Chris Stafford, who plays Eric as a sweetly naive young man without becoming sappy. Tina Holmes is great as Maggie, giving a wonderful performance of someone torn between love and then hate. Stephanie McVay plays Eric's sweet &amp; headstrong Mom, and gives her character emotional depth (especially when Eric finally admits his homosexuality). Best of all, Lea Delaria is an absolute treat as the summer job boss and local gay bar owner that turns into the friend &amp; tour guide we all wish we had when coming out.Accompanied by a terrific soundtrack featuring Bronski Beat, the Eurythmics, and the Thompson Twins (for all you Twins' lovers, frontman Tom Bailey composed the score!), this movie wins on all points. I think you'll greatly enjoy it and ask for a repeat viewing... especially if your life often mirrored it, like some anonymous reviewer.",5,Love in the age of new wave,1001203200,"09 23, 2001",2001,2029,"['Yes', 'quot', 'coming', 'out', 'quot', 'movie', 'Luckily', 'one', 'out', 'crowd', 'thanks', 'great', 'performances', 'honest', 'sensitive', 'portrayal.It', '1984', 'Sandusky', 'Ohio', '17-year-old', 'Eric', 'Stafford', 'junior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'summer', 'job', 'serving', 'food', 'local', 'amusement', 'park', 'best', 'friend', 'Maggie', 'Holmes', 'openly', 'gay', 'Rod', 'Gabrych', 'who', 'Eric', 'off', 'road', 'realizing', 'budding', 'homosexuality.The', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'truthful', 'highs', 'amp', 'lows', 'coming', 'out', 'teens', 'Eric', 'discovery', 'first', 'several', 'gay', 'sexual', 'experiences', 'sex', 'love', 'first', 'gay', 'bar', 'silently', 'quot', 'quot', 'calling', 'classmates', 'sexuality', 'family', 'amp', 'sleeps', 'then', 'best', 'female', 'friend', 'morphing', 'quot', 'quot', 'eccentric', 'dressing', 'hair-dyed', '80', 'new', 'wave', 'child', 'attempt', 'become', 'individual', 'results', 'are', 'honest', 'funny', 'heartfelt', 'displayed', 'unexpected', 'sexual', 'candor.The', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'real', 'stand-out', 'Chris', 'Stafford', 'who', 'Eric', 'sweetly', 'naive', 'young', 'man', 'becoming', 'sappy', 'Tina', 'Holmes', 'great', 'Maggie', 'giving', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'someone', 'torn', 'love', 'then', 'hate', 'Stephanie', 'McVay', 'Eric', 'sweet', 'amp', 'headstrong', 'Mom', 'character', 'emotional', 'depth', 'especially', 'when', 'Eric', 'finally', 'homosexuality', 'Best', 'Lea', 'Delaria', 'absolute', 'treat', 'summer', 'job', 'boss', 'local', 'gay', 'bar', 'owner', 'friend', 'amp', 'wish', 'had', 'when', 'coming', 'out.Accompanied', 'terrific', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Bronski', 'Beat', 'Eurythmics', 'Thompson', 'Twins', 'Twins', 'lovers', 'frontman', 'Tom', 'Bailey', 'composed', 'score', 'movie', 'points', 'think', ""'ll"", 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'ask', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'especially', 'life', 'often', 'mirrored', 'anonymous', 'reviewer']",Edge of Seventeen

He plays Eric, a 17 year old high school student in Ohio, circa 1984, who can't begin to lay the foundations of his adult life until he's come to terms with his emerging sexuality. Intrigued by an openly gay workmate (Andersen Gabrych) at the diner where they both work after school, Eric finally plucks up the courage to explore his true self, guided by the diner's matriarchal lesbian owner (Lea DeLaria, playing substitute mother to a predominantly young  cast), only to discover that people aren't always what they seem.For such a young actor, Stafford is breathtakingly good as the teenager both excited and terrified by the strange directions in which his life is pulling him. Todd Stephens' script captures the highs and lows of first love and rejection, and Stafford plays it with just the right amount of charm and naivety. Perhaps director Moreton could have beefed up some of the dramatic fireworks which dominate the second half of the picture, (SPOILER ALERT) notably Eric's confession to a close female friend (Tina  Holmes) who secretly loves him and is crushed by his revelation, and the  heartbreaking moment when Eric finally comes out to his mother (Stephanie  McVay) (END OF SPOILER), though these scenes still retain much of their impact and are extremely well-acted by all concerned.Some viewers have complained that the movie ends too abruptly, with many of Eric's problems unresolved. But if the film has any message at all, it's that few people reach the end of the rainbow, and sometimes it can take a lifetime to resolve the worst of our difficulties, if at all.

552505,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,B00004UEDZ,Robert Amsel,"[0, 0]","This teenaged gay coming-out story is very special, not only because it captures the coming-out experiences of those who were teenagers during the mid-1980s (with particular music, fashions, language, etc.) but also because of its universal appeal and truths.  Gay people who came out in any decade can relate to the innocent hero's romantic hopes that his first lover will be his last, while his older seducer is far more interested in acquiring as many notches to his bedpost as he can muster.  Naturally, our hero is disillusioned and wishes to return to the closet, a solution that is ultimately not viable.  There is a sense of honesty about the film that suggests that it is based on autobiography, and perhaps, here is where the trouble lies.  Despite this film's being far more realistic than most gay coming-out movies, which are heavier on idyllic romance, this movie loses momentum at the end.  Construction-wise, there is no genuine climax (our hero's unsatisfactory attempt to make love to a female friend and then his coming out to a mother who is unable to cope does not make a climax).  And lacking a climax, the movie can't have a satisfactory ending.  The fact that our hero has forsworn the local gay bar for a time, and now returns, is not a workable resolution.

It is so well done and so well produced it's uncanny!  Clothing, vehicles, music - everything.  Interior scenes.  It is EXACTLY what it was like in the 80's!  And the antics the lead character goes through were so similar to what I went through it was scary!  I just kept thinking over and over again, ""That's Me!"" The wild 80's clothes.  Bleaching the hair.  It was like watching a mirror reflection of my teenage years.Coming out in the 80's wasn't easy and it sure as hell wasn't accepted!  It sure as hell wasn't as easily obtained either!  You did have to go on body language or eye movement or whatever.  There was no internet or dating websites or any of that crap.  The only way you knew who was gay was by word of mouth.  Just figuring it all out on your own and there was a certain beauty to that.  With today's internet, ANYTHING you have ever had a thought about is within 2 clicks of a mouse - BAM!  Right there on your computer screen.  There's no guesswork or fumbling.  You know it all before you even get out and try it.The 80's was the last of the ""innocent"" eras.  Watching this movie my chin was on the ground because it was so realistic and it was so interesting to think, ""Wow!  I had that sweater!""  or ""Wow!  I had that record!""  The ""new wave"" music that was used is EXACTLY the same music I listened to back then which was considered ""gay"".  It was interesting to see that the same things you thought or experienced, somebody else did too during that era.  Coming from small town America it was thrilling to watch this movie and see the similarities even in a larger city.  And I even worked in an amusement park too!  So it REALLY was like telling the story of my life.  Cute, funny, serious - it handles all the topics tastefully and very well.  KUDOS!",5,KUDOS!

Then I read about the film and realized it was a gay coming of age/coming out film.  It no longer mattered that Stevie's music played no part in the movie.I came out in 1985.  Though I was in college, not high school, in 1984, this film could be the story of my life.  I would be Eric.  The one charging head first into the gay scene only to be used and feel like I was taken advantage of.  The story is so realistic and so true to my coming out, I couldn't help but love this movie. The use of music to set the time and place was powerful.The fact that this film is low budget and an indie makes this film feel so much more honest in the portrayal of everything.  It feels so real.The relationship between Eric and Rod, Eric and Maggie, Eric and his mother are all mirror images of scenes from my life.  While the acting is at times a little &quot;naive&quot;, it seems to work well.  The movies flows so well, there is never a dull moment.  This is a fun movie, though it shows a difficult topic.  Though I had heard many times from many people, that we gay men all had similar coming out experiences, it never hit home until I saw this movie.  The fact that someone could make a movie like this tells me that I wasn't alone in what I was thinking or feeling.I saw this film for the first time when I was 36 years old.  I saw it on the closing night of the Gay and Lesbian Festival in Rochester, NY.  The movie felt like a validation of my life.  I felt so incredibly good about myself after seeing this film, I went home and started to call people who I hadn't come out to and simply told them &quot;I'm gay&quot;.  I think this is an indication that this is one powerful movie.  After the film festival, the film came back to Rochester and I made it a personal mission to drag all my friends to see this film.  I lost track how many times I saw it in the theater.  And now, Edge of 17 has become the second film of my new DVD collection.I would love to see a sequel.
