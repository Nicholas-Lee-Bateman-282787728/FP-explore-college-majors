1419635,AYFFWPUMI2MDH,B004M20YUI,BKR,"[0, 0]","The actor who plays Van Veeteren (I believe his name is Sven Wolter), carries this series. I'm not saying the other actors aren't good, but it just wouldn't hold together without Wolter. I've read a couple of the novels the series is based on, and in them, Van Veteeren starts as a working Inspector who retires to the bookstore after several novels. In the TV series he starts out retired, but he remains heavily involved in the cases. While I like the Martin Beck series and the Krister Henriksson Wallander series much better, this one grows on you; and Sven Wolter is really a wonderful actor.",4,Good series,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,597,"['actor', 'who', 'Van', 'Veeteren', 'believe', 'name', 'Sven', 'Wolter', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'other', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'Wolter', ""'ve"", 'read', 'couple', 'novels', 'series', 'based', 'Van', 'Veteeren', 'working', 'Inspector', 'who', 'bookstore', 'several', 'novels', 'TV', 'series', 'out', 'retired', 'heavily', 'involved', 'cases', 'like', 'Martin', 'Beck', 'series', 'Krister', 'Henriksson', 'Wallander', 'series', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'Sven', 'Wolter', 'really', 'wonderful', 'actor']",Van Veeteren: Episodes 1-3

The plots were surprisingly easy to follow with excellent, highly visible subtitles. The pacing is somewhat slow and measured but this helps to keep the viewer on track.
