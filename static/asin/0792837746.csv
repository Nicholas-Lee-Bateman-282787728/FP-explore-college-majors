What I like about it is that it feels real.  You're transported into a time and place and it feels authentic.  In this case it's Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in the Summer of '63 and what I like is that this film does not resort to cliche in depicting the South during that turbulent time in our history.  The four leads are full-bodied characters written and performed wonderfully nonesomuch as Annabeth Gish as Pudge.  Only through some plot contrivance would you consider her fat.  Her performance at the shag contest is ebullient and puts Jennifer Grey to shame.  I thought the music in the film was great but it's been pointed out by other reviewers that some of the songs have been deleted and substituted.

The Shag you see was a man's purvue dance. The lady was simply there to bring him back to her presence. So this movie is really very true to the way life was in the Southern States in the 1950's and early 1960's. The Shag still lives today and it is a worldwide dance phenomena.

Lambeth,"[30, 34]","What a brilliant movie, with the exception of the end where the girls sing together on the porchsteps of the sentator's summer home in Myrtle Beach. That little Dirty Dancing ripoff was really, really lame. But the rest of the movie was great! Robert Rustler, who didn't act in a billion other movies like I thought he would, gave the performance of his lifetime. Tyrone Power Jr looks like his daddy. You already know Phoebe Cates, Bridget Fonda, and Annabeth Gish. Great eye candy for a really, really fun movie. It's a beach movie without the stupidity.I've probably watched this movie 50 times. Nothing like watching a summer vacation in Myrtle Beach to put you in a good mood. Hanging out at the Grand Strand...shaggin' and drinking bevos (oddly enough, a bevo was a non-alcoholic beverage in prohibition days...a fact that has nothing to do with this review)...that's the life!Shag has great music, fun dialogue, famous speeches, some hot shaggin', Elvis impersonators, and great party scenes that make the movie flow really fast while a smile is on your face the entire time.For the DVD, I didn't think the sound quality was very good. I have 50's movies that had better sound. I own Annette Funicello's Pajama Party on DVD. It has MUCH better sound. So that was disappointing, especially considering there's music throughout the entire movie.  But even though the sound is a little disappointing and there's no special features in this movie (aside from a trailer), this movie is still one you should own.After about 50 views, I finally picked up on something that I thought I'd share, since I feel a warm sense of accomplishment.In the car ride, Melaina was giving Caroline (Pudge) her fortune. Caroline picked yellow. No idea why, since she wore a blue dress at the end of the movie. Anyway, she picked Yellow, and the fortune was: You will marry Bullwinkle and raise 5 kids (or however many kids; that's unimportant). Fast forward to the party scene...underneath the table that had booze sprinking off the tablecloth. Chip (her love interest in the movie) does a Bullwinkle impression! He blows Pudge away with it! From that point, it becomes a standing joke. HER FORTUNE WAS PROBABLY CORRECT! Isn't that something? Watch it again. Dance with it. Tie nylons to a bedpost and shag with yourself. It deserves the 5 stars I gave it for fun, nostalgia, music, and girls. It's the most fun!Don't get caught with your rooster showing. Buy the movie!",5,Y-E-L-L-O-W.

I rock'em', roll'em' all night long; I'm a 60-minute man.&#34; This coming-of-age film is about four high school girls from Spartanburg, SC, heading out on the sly to Myrtle Beach for one last post-graduation bash before settling down to college life...or whatever life they've chosen. So, yes there is a plot but as one reviewer has stated...&#34;Who cares?!&#34; If you're a Boomer and you came of age in the early 60s like I did (I graduated high school in 63 just like the kids in the movie) you're not watching this for any plot...you're watching it for the music, the dance...and the nostalgia rush. I've loved this film since it first came out in 89...it is a great nostalgia flick, reminescent of &#34;American Graffiti&#34; - sort of an east coast &#34;American Graffiti&#34;-light. If you grew up in the Carolinas, then you likely know what the term &#34;Beach Music&#34; means and you know what the dance called &#34;The Shag&#34; or &#34;Carolina Shag&#34; is. You'll hear plenty of Beach Music in this film, like The Dominoes' &#34;Sixty-Minute Man&#34;, which is excerpted to begin this review; and &#34;39-21-40 Shape&#34; by the Showmen, excerpted below...and you'll see plenty of dancing, especially The Shag. They were doing the Carolina Shag in the beach pavilions and dance halls in North & South Carolina in the early 60s, when this film is set; and they are still doing it. The kids who perform in this film (they were kids then) are all great; and you will likely recognize a couple of them; especially Bridget Fonda, who went on the stardom. Page Hannah, the gangly, geeky one is Daryl's sister.

One of the most overlooked but greatest girl-movies all time, *Shag* is a meticulously crafted period piece that takes a look back at the summer of '63 - a hallowed summer cinematically, supposedly representing an innocent America untouched by the coming traumas of the Sixties. It is the story of four girls who have just graduated from high school who hightail it to Myrtle Beach - the forbidden zone of boys and booze. As they whoop it up, each of them has their eyes opened to a reality that is not part of the world their parents laid out for them. ""Y'all, I'm *wild*,"" Cates' character tells her friends towards the end of the movie, ""I guess I always have been - I just didn't know it,"" and Cates' youthful beauty and innocence make it completely believable. Page Hannah (Daryl's sister) seems to not take herself as seriously as her more famous sister does - and her hilarious portrayal of the tight-assed Luanne morphs from rigid propriety to semi-unbridled lust. Pudge finally meets a boy who loves her for everything she is, and Gish has a field day with the character. But it is Fonda's portrayal of the bad-girl preacher's daughter who steals the show.
