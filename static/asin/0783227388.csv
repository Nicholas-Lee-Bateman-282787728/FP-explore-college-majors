58313,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,0783227388,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[1, 2]","""Uncle Buck"" is a film of the late 1980's, pretty typical in a lot of ways, nothing special, but not a bad film either, not at all. It involves a pretty typical (again) family dealing with an emergency; the parents have to leave for a few days as one of the grandparents has just had a heart attack and must be hospitalized. And they need someone to watch the kids while they're gone. Hence, by default, here comes the goofball uncle.The movie wastes no time telling us there's a lot of tension between the oldest daughter and the rest of the family. Tia  Russel (portrayed with lots of venom by Jean Louisa Kelly) is a very pretty teenage girl with a hideous disposition; man, she's nasty. In the old days the parents handled this type of brat with a good slap; cruel, borderline abuse, maybe, but that's how someone like this used to be handled. I'm not condoning this, just making a point. This girl is vicious.John Candy is cast as Buck Russel, a fun-loving, good-hearted, but irresponsible man, engaged to  a woman named Chanice, who is rapidly losing patience with Buck; he hasn't officially committed to her, and her clock is ticking, as the old phrase goes. Their relationship is being strained to the breaking point, and is in danger of ending. So when he cuts out on his fiance again, this time to help with his nephew and nieces, this is practically the last straw. There is a very real danger of it ending between them.When Buck comes to stay with his brother's kids during this latest crisis, the terrible relationship between Buck and Tia becomes more pronounced, as he tries everything he knows to make things well, and she just gives him an emotional beat-down. They each have a lot of growing up to do, but at least he's trying. Again, she is vicious. How can such a pretty face be connected to so sour a personality? At least Miles and Maizy are nice kids. A scene well worth watching is the quick question-and-answer session between Buck and Miles (Macaulay Culkin, a natural) at breakfast. It's quick and short, but it shows tremendous comic talent in both actors. The timing is spot on.As the story progresses, one sees that Buck's observations of a boy Tia likes, nicknamed ""Bug,"" are correct. He's scum, and she defiantly stays with him, oblivious to Buck's warnings. But he perseveres in outing him as the lowlife he really is, much to her painful benefit.Some of the humor is forced, as when Buck visits the school's principal in lieu of the absent parents. The bit is funny, but just as awkwardly written as the feeling between Buck and the principal is supposed to be. Yes, it's funny, but stupid.Predictably, all the wrongs are righted at the film's conclusion, as per this type of film, without some frustrating cliff-hanger ending. And despite a few risque innuendos, this is pretty tame, feel-good viewing. Very well-acted, especially looking at the ages of several of the cast members. People this young, being on camera without looking or sounding like they are reading cue cards, is a rarity.As stated earlier, this isn't a standout, but it certainly isn't a dud either.",4,It's always nice to see things work out,1295481600,"01 20, 2011",2011,3104,"['Uncle', 'Buck', 'film', 'late', '1980', 'pretty', 'typical', 'lot', 'ways', 'nothing', 'special', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'pretty', 'typical', 'again', 'family', 'dealing', 'emergency', 'parents', 'have', 'leave', 'few', 'days', 'one', 'grandparents', 'just', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'must', 'be', 'hospitalized', 'need', 'someone', 'watch', 'kids', ""'re"", 'gone', 'Hence', 'default', 'here', 'goofball', 'uncle.The', 'movie', 'time', 'telling', 'lot', 'tension', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'rest', 'family', 'Tia', 'Russel', 'portrayed', 'lots', 'venom', 'Jean', 'Louisa', 'Kelly', 'very', 'pretty', 'teenage', 'girl', 'hideous', 'disposition', 'man', 'nasty', 'old', 'days', 'parents', 'handled', 'type', 'brat', 'good', 'slap', 'cruel', 'borderline', 'abuse', 'maybe', 'how', 'someone', 'used', 'be', 'handled', ""'m"", 'not', 'condoning', 'just', 'making', 'point', 'girl', 'vicious.John', 'Candy', 'cast', 'Buck', 'Russel', 'fun-loving', 'good-hearted', 'irresponsible', 'man', 'engaged', 'woman', 'named', 'Chanice', 'who', 'rapidly', 'losing', 'patience', 'Buck', ""n't"", 'officially', 'committed', 'clock', 'ticking', 'old', 'phrase', 'relationship', 'being', 'strained', 'breaking', 'point', 'danger', 'ending', 'So', 'when', 'out', 'fiance', 'again', 'time', 'help', 'nephew', 'nieces', 'practically', 'last', 'straw', 'very', 'real', 'danger', 'ending', 'them.When', 'Buck', 'stay', 'brother', 'kids', 'latest', 'crisis', 'terrible', 'relationship', 'Buck', 'Tia', 'more', 'pronounced', 'everything', 'make', 'things', 'well', 'just', 'emotional', 'beat-down', 'have', 'lot', 'growing', 'up', 'do', 'least', 'trying', 'Again', 'vicious', 'How', 'can', 'such', 'pretty', 'face', 'be', 'connected', 'so', 'sour', 'personality', 'least', 'Miles', 'Maizy', 'are', 'nice', 'kids', 'scene', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'quick', 'question-and-answer', 'session', 'Buck', 'Miles', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'natural', 'breakfast', 'quick', 'short', 'tremendous', 'comic', 'talent', 'actors', 'timing', 'spot', 'story', 'one', 'Buck', 'observations', 'boy', 'Tia', 'nicknamed', 'Bug', 'are', 'correct', 'scum', 'defiantly', 'oblivious', 'Buck', 'warnings', 'outing', 'lowlife', 'really', 'much', 'painful', 'benefit.Some', 'humor', 'forced', 'when', 'Buck', 'school', 'principal', 'lieu', 'absent', 'parents', 'bit', 'funny', 'just', 'awkwardly', 'written', 'feeling', 'Buck', 'principal', 'supposed', 'be', 'Yes', 'funny', 'stupid.Predictably', 'wrongs', 'are', 'righted', 'film', 'conclusion', 'type', 'film', 'frustrating', 'cliff-hanger', 'ending', 'few', 'risque', 'innuendos', 'pretty', 'tame', 'feel-good', 'viewing', 'Very', 'well-acted', 'especially', 'looking', 'ages', 'several', 'cast', 'members', 'People', 'young', 'being', 'camera', 'looking', 'sounding', 'are', 'reading', 'cue', 'cards', 'rarity.As', 'stated', 'earlier', ""n't"", 'standout', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'dud']",N/A

He may not have won a ton of awards, but the regular folks (as opposed to film snobs) love his work and have made him a very wealthy man.  A list of his better known films would have to start with ""Home Alone"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" and would continue with ""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Pretty in Pink,"" ""Planes, Trains, & Automobiles,"" and ""Sixteen Candles,"" as well as many others.This particular John Hughes film stars John Candy as Uncle Buck, the kind of character Candy specialized in.  He's a middle-aged kid who can't seem to find a good reason to accept any responsibility in life.  As he says in one scene, ""People used to say to me, 'Buck, you've got it made.  You've got no kids, no wife, no office, no desk, no boss, nothing to tie you down.  You've really got it made.'  Well, they don't say that to me any more.""Among Hughes's ""coming of age"" pictures, this one is unique.  The coming of age is usually a teen or preteen.  Here's it's Uncle Buck who is coming of age.  His brother and sister-in-law have to leave town for a few days to tend his brother's ailing father-in-law, and they are absolutely devoid of babysitters...except for Uncle Buck, the embarrassing relation they have chosen to avoid until now.  Their three kids include 15-year-old Tia (Jean Louisa Kelly, now seen on TV's ""Yes, Dear,"" in her film debut), 8-year-old Miles (Macaulay Culkin, his first major film role and the one that inspired Hughes to give him his next major role in a little something called ""Home Alone""), and 6-year-old Gaby Hoffman (shortly before she played the child lead in ""Sleepless in Seattle"").You can practically write the film yourself from there, to a point.  Buck has to be responsible for the kids, falls in love with them, is a far better (and much, much funnier) surrogate dad than anyone could have guessed, and by film's end things have all changed for the better.  Sure, it's a little too much of a happy Hollywood ending to be true (OK, way much too much), but one doesn't expect Shakespeare here, just good, solid, entertaining comedy with a heart.  That's typical John Hughes, and since he gives us so many good laughs we forgive him if it doesn't always completely ring true.

58335,A2WFT4BUHNQZ1X,0783227388,Darian Dennison,"[0, 0]","After over 10 years, I still never get tired of watching this movie and this is one of the few movies that me and my family talk about, the movie is about Cindy's aunt calling her in the middle of the night saying that her father suffered a heart attack so they need to leave for an emergency, but there's a problem, they don't have anybody to watch the kids, Cindy's husband Bob suggested Marcie who lives across the street but Cindy refused and decides that the Nevilles should take care of the kids, but the Nevilles weren't available then they decide to get Bob's brother Buck (the titled character and Cindy actually refused cause she didn't like Buck's carefree lifestyle of partying and gambling).Then Uncle Buck gets woken up by the phone call and Bob tells Buck that they need somebody to watch the kids then Buck is honored to do so, there's a hilarious scene when Uncle Buck knocks on their door but it turns out to be the house across the street and the neighbor gets woken up, the parents leave is Uncle Buck checks out the antique plates and accidentally drops one but it didn't break but he bangs it on the piano but it breaks!!There's a hilarious scene when Uncle Buck was cooking breakfast and singing 'Tweedle Dee' and his rebelious teenage niece Tia shows up in a bad mood and she despises Uncle Buck but Miles and Maizy (Tia's younger brother and sister) likes him and he takes the kids to school and the car backfires, later on there's a hilarious scene when Uncle Buck picks up Tia, Tia is hanging out with her womanizing boyfriend Bug and the car again backfires, Bug askes Uncle Buck 'You ever hear of a tune-up, hee hee hee' Buck: 'Hee Hee Hee, you ever hear of a ritual killing, hee hee hee' Bug: 'I don't get it' Buck: 'You ever gnaw on her face like that again and you'll be one, hee hee hee' and takes off with the door open with Bug nearby.There's another classic scene during Miles's birthday when Uncle Buck makes them a giant pancake and the children's mother orders a clown to show up at Mile's birthday party but the clown shows up dead drunk and Uncle Buck wasn't happy about it and tells him to leave but the clown cusses at Uncle Buck and he punches the clown in the nose.Then Uncle Buck goes out and picks up Tia and tries to scare Bug with an ax is another scene, 'Wait a minute, Bug, Gnat, is there a similararity going on around here, whoo I guess there is'.Then Uncle Buck goes to Maizy's conference (which was scheduled with the mother) and the assistant principal has a huge wart on her nose and she introduces her, Buck: Buck's Wart Russell, not the wart, I'm the wart and the assistant principal claims that she sees a bad egg when she looks at Maizy and Uncle Buck gets onto her by telling her that she's so mean to everybody and gets onto to her and she feels hurt by it, another classic moment.Later on that night, Uncle Buck's girlfriend Chanice calls and askes for Buck but Tia lied to Chanice by telling her that Uncle Buck was cheating on her then the next morning, Marcie shows up at the rescidence wanting to dance with Uncle Buck then Chanice shows up and she thinks that Uncle Buck is cheating on her and cusses him out.Then Uncle Buck announces that he's going to the racetrack the following day but ends up not going cause Tia was going to Bug's party but Uncle Buck refused to let Tia go to it so he needed to find her, at Bug's house Uncle Buck walks on the stairs with a bunch of people around it and only to find that the girl that was in Bug's room wasn't Tia then Uncle Buck finds Tia all heartbroken and she apologizes Uncle Buck for all the pain she put him through and he forgives her and Tia askes  Uncle Buck if he did anything to Bug, sure enough he put Bug inside the trunk and Uncle Buck askes Bug to apologize and Bug cusses at Uncle Buck and he tells Bug that he is an amatuer dentist and they leave Bug stranded and again, he cusses at Bug and he got what was coming to him, another classic scene and to bad that network television had to edit out that part.Then Tia now respects Uncle Buck and Chanice gave Uncle Buck another chance cause Tia confessed to what she told Chanice and Mom and Dad came home and Cindy's father survived the heart attack and they became a better family from that point on.I think that Uncle Buck is one of the best comedies of all time and it's especially one of John Candy's best performances and my only gripe about this movie is the constant swearing (for a PG movie, it should've been PG-13 and some of the sexual content like that one scene they showed inside the school when a guy grabs a girl's buttocks or when Bug was down on that other girl) but overall it's a classic movie and it's better than half of the comedies that's around today.",5,Great John Candy Flick,1058918400,"07 23, 2003",2003,4753,"['10', 'years', 'still', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'movies',

58336,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0783227388,David Baldwin,"[2, 3]","After ""Only the Lonely""(DVD release, please!) this is probably one of the late, great John Candy's finer screen moments.  Credit has to go to director-screenwriter John Hughes for presenting a full-bodied portrait of an adult male adolescent who through circumstance is forced to grow up and take responsibility.  In a way this film kind of explores themes that writer Nick Hornby assayed years later.  Not to say that there aren't moments of enjoyable broad comedy but a nice balance is on display here with the more serious themes and the humor.  The humor is not over-the-top and it is grounded in reality.  Candy shows tremendous range here.  It's a known fact that he was a master comedian but here he flexes some dramatic muscles and makes Buck one of his more indelible characters.  Jean Kelly is equally impressive as Tia the sullen, rebellious teenage girl in Buck's charge.  This character could have been insufferable but Kelly hits all the right buttons and gives an accurate account of teen angst.  The two younger children played by Macauley Culkin and Gaby Hoffmann come off as normal and unaffected.

Some of my favorite movies stars John Candy like ""The Great Outdoors"" and ""Spaceballs"". ""Uncle Buck"" is another hilarious movie John starred in. He plays a happy-go-lucky bachelor named Buck who is a bit of a slob and not very responsible either. He gets a call from his brother in Chicago asking him to babysit his children while he and his wife go take care of his wife's father who had fallen ill. Buck agrees and goes to his brother's house, not knowing what was in store for him. Buck has to contend with two precocious children (one of them played by then unknown Macaulay Culkin)and one angst-riddled teenager named Tia. Tia gives Buck a run for his money with her teenage angst. This leads to a lot of conflict between the two especially when it concerned Tia's boyfriend. The two younger siblings Maisy and Miles are simply a handful and enjoys Buck's company. I particularly loved the scene when Buck is making pancakes and flips an enormous pancake with a shovel.

Whether he's making 6 foot pancakes for breakfast or scaring everyone with the backfire on his car, Buck does things in his whole way.This movie has much of the same type of comedy that you would see in Stripes and Caddyshack.

It's not surprising since John Hughes is the writer, producer and director of both films. Buck is a simple man with simple pleasures. He likes his freedom, his leisure time, and his bowling. He has a girlfriend who desperately wants him to grow up but...he can't be bothered.But when Buck is called to the wintry, affluent suburbs to look after his brother's kids for a couple of weeks (much to his sister-in-law's horror) he learns what it's like to be a responsible adult and does surprisingly well with his extended babysitting chore (in his own unique way).Uncle Buck was Candy's fourth (of five) collaboration with Hughes and the role is clearly tailor-made for him. He may be a slob, and the underdog, but he's the kind of relative you'll all wish you had. The comedy is underplayed and quiet, and the drama involving without being overbearing. It's all just easy-going entertainment that's perfect for brightening up a dull afternoon, and yet another reminder that Hollywood lost someone very special in March 1994.The Blu Ray looks great in 1080p 1.85:1 widescreen, but Universal have given us a lossy, DVD quality Dolby 2.0 soundtrack.

This may be my favorite John Candy movie; he delivers just enough laughs, kooky faces, oddball scenarios, and charm to keep a smile on any viewers face the entire movie.Uncle Buck (Candy) is an irresponsible bachelor, a loveable screw-up who ends up being the last babysitting option for unwilling parents - Buck's brother and sister-in-law - and the end result is comic gold.  The three children are sure to be a handful: 15-year-old Tia (Kelly), an angst-ridden, confused teenager; 8-year-old Miles (Culkin), a mischevious yet cute bundle of energy; and 6-year-old Maizy (Hoffman), a precocious youngster who sparkles on screen.  Buck has no real family, cooking, or general housekeeping skills, yet his honest attempts while pleasing the three children makes the character very sympathetic.After winning over the youngsters with his zany antics like making pancakes so massive they have to be flipped with a snow shovel and delivering a verbal beatdown to an evil elementary school Vice Principal (see my title), Buck struggles with not only his attempts to mentor and befriend Tia, but also his slow realization that up to this point in his life, he has been truly devoid of happiness.The battle between Tia and Buck continues until Buck traumatizes Tia's dirtbag boyfriend with an electric drill, and then beans him with a well-placed shot from a 5-wood.Eventually, Buck grows up, surprises everyone involved with his behavior, ends up being a great role model, and reestablishing himself as part of his brother's family.  This is a funny, heart-warming movie that's perfect for a family viewing.

Many great supporting actors & scenes which still hold up over nearly 25 years later. The problem, and the reason this is getting 2 stars, the Blu Ray is a complete JOKE.. NO EXTRAS AT ALL - No Trailers, nothing.. not even the lame bios included on the DVD's. One of the most respected films by Hughes, never given the respect it deserves with a proper video release.. I despise that blu ray was touted as having all this mega space on the discs, but the features aren't there.. The companies tell you to log on to blu ray live, but even that's a joke, it usually doesn't work & it's just a piss poor excuse for these companies to control content that should be on the discs itself.. The picture quality on the blue ray is terrible..It's grainy and at times ugly to watch..A previous reviewer noted the same thing, but I thought maybe their settings were off - nope, it's really bad.. I guess Universal felt like adding the DVD was a special bonus..but I already had the DVD, so ..now I have two DVD's and a Blu Ray...And finally, the digital copy (sigh).. First off, the two disc blu ray which arrived unopened today, and had the ""digital copy"" inside, expired December 2012, but luckily, this one still worked for me on Vudu.. If you try and redeem the digital copy thru Flixster, you can't... So if you do get one of these, register with Vudu & it'll go thru..and you get the HDX version too.. though it's sad to say, it's better to watch the standard version to avoid the over grain. I know Amazon may not like the mentioning of these services on their site, but they don't offer/support ultra violet/digital copy redemption (at this time).. hopefully that will change in the near future (nudge)..Bottom line, if you want a digital copy to have (if it'll work for you), buy it.. It's cheaper than actually buying a digital copy.. If you have the DVD, don't buy the blu ray..But the most important thing to note is that these companies need to get their acts together, 'cause blu ray is the biggest bait and switch con that I've ever seen... I can see why DVD still hangs on all these years later, which is funny, 'cause that's where they put all the special features...",2,2 Stars for a 4&1/2 star classic.

She treats her mother disrespectfully, is self-centered, and carries that attitude on to Buck, who is trying to do the right things by the kids,  In other words, she is playing the part of an ordinary 15-year-old who has never been properly disciplined by her parents.This was a great movie.  I particularly enjoyed the parts where Buck was threatening Tia's boyfriend, Bug (Jay Underwood), who has dishonorable designs on the girl.  Buck's threatening attitude was delicious, and my appreciation no doubt reflects my own dislike of teenaged boys, the same feelings as any man who has had teenaged daughters to raise.  Namely: that they should all be imprisoned until they are at least 40-years-old and rendered eunuchs, and the girls' fathers need to be well armed at all times with shotguns, and the boys in question should be left with absolutely no doubt as to the fathers' willingness--even eagerness--to use them with the intent to emasculate the culprits who dare to even think about touching their daughter.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books",5,Another great John Candy comedy,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,3234,"['Director', 'John', 'HughesFormat', 'ColorStudio', 'Universal', 'StudiosVideo', 'Release', 'Date', 'January', '19', '1999Cast', 'John', 'Candy', 'Buck', 'RussellJean', 'Louisa', 'Kelly', 'Tia', 'RussellGaby', 'Hoffmann', 'Maisy', 'RussellMacaulay', 'Culkin', 'Miles', 'RussellAmy', 'Madigan', 'Chanice', 'KobolowskiElaine', 'Bromka', 'Cindy', 'RussellGarrett', 'M.', 'Brown', 'Bob', 'RussellLaurie', 'Metcalf', 'Marcie', 'Dahlgren-FrostJay', 'Underwood', 'BugBrian', 'Tarantina', 'E.', 'Roger', 'CoswellMike', 'Starr', 'Pooter-the-ClownSuzanne', 'Shepherd', 'Mrs.', 'HogarthWilliam', 'Windom', 'Mr.', 'HatfieldDennis', 'Cockrum', 'PalJoel', 'Robinson', 'Miles', 'Friend', '1Colin', 'Baumgartner', 'Miles', 'Friend', '2Erik', 'Whipple', 'Miles', 'Friend', '3Mark', 'Rosenthal', 'Party', 'Boy', '1Doug', 'von', 'Nessen', 'Party', 'Boy', '2Wayne', 'Kneeland', 'Party', 'Boy', '3Gigi', 'Casler', 'Party', 'Girl', 'BedroomLaVerne', 'Anderson', 'Party', 'Girl', '1Gina', 'Doctor', 'Party', 'Girl', '2Rachel', 'Thompson', 'Perrine', 'Party', 'Girl', '3Ron', 'Payne', 'Maisy', 'TeacherJane', 'Vickerilla', 'Teacher', '1Kyle', 'Lewis', 'Eastman', 'School', 'ChildDana', 'Taylor', 'School', 'ChildJennifer', 'Kane', 'School', 'ChildChristen', 'Loftis', 'School', 'ChildGenae', 'Affrunti', 'School', 'ChildAnna', 'Chlumsky', 'School', 'ChildBetsy', 'Bottando', 'Woman', 'CarJulia', 'Morgan', 'Additional', 'VoicesGranville', 'Ames', 'Additional', 'VoicesRamey', 'Ellis', 'Additional', 'VoicesLeigh', 'French', 'Additional', 'VoicesPatricia', 'Arquette', 'Additional', 'VoicesLaura', 'Jacoby', 'Additional', 'VoicesDevon', 'Odessa', 'Additional', 'VoicesArnold', 'F.', 'Turner', 'Additional', 'VoicesGarin', 'Bouble', 'Additional', 'VoicesTim', 'Hoskins', 'Additional', 'VoicesJulie', 'Payne', 'Additional', 'VoicesJack', 'Blessing', 'Additional', 'VoicesTodd', 'Larson', 'Additional', 'VoicesMichael', 'Berkowitz', 'StudentRyan', 'Todd', 'School', 'ChildThe', 'Russell', 'have', 'go', 'Indianapolis', 'Cindy', 'Elaine', 'Bromka', 'father', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anyone', 'watch', 'three', 'children', 'are', 'gone', 'batchelor', 'uncle', 'Buck', 'John', 'Candy', 'Bob', 'brother', 'Garrett', 'M.', 'Brown', 'little', 'kid', 'Maisy', 'Miles', 'Gaby', 'Hoffman', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'are', 'great', 'problem', 'exception', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Tia', 'Jean', 'Louisa', 'Kelly', 'who', 'pouting', 'angry', 'snotty', 'rebellious', 'little', 'jerk', 'mother', 'disrespectfully', 'self-centered', 'attitude', 'Buck', 'who', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'things', 'kids', 'other', 'words', 'playing', 'part', 'ordinary', '15-year-old', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'properly', 'disciplined', 'parents.This', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'parts', 'where', 'Buck', 'was', 'threatening', 'Tia', 'boyfriend', 'Bug', 'Jay', 'Underwood', 'who', 'dishonorable', 'designs', 'girl', 'Buck', 'threatening', 'attitude', 'was', 'delicious', 'appreciation', 'doubt', 'own', 'dislike', 'teenaged', 'boys', 'same', 'feelings', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'teenaged', 'daughters', 'raise', 'Namely', 'should', 'be', 'imprisoned', 'are', 'least', '40-years-old', 'rendered', 'eunuchs', 'girls', 'fathers', 'need', 'be', 'well', 'armed', 'times', 'shotguns', 'boys', 'question', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'absolutely', 'doubt', 'fathers', 'willingness', 'even', 'eagerness', 'use', 'intent', 'emasculate', 'culprits', 'who', 'dare', 'even', 'think', 'touching', 'daughter.Joseph', 'Joe', 'Pierreauthor', 'Handguns', 'Freedom', 'care', 'maintenanceand', 'other', 'books']",N/A

58378,A240QB45BSMDAN,0783227388,Josh P.,"[0, 0]","""Uncle Buck"" is a great family comedy that finds John Candy in the title role who is reluctantly called upon in a family emergency: he's left in charge of taking care of his brother's three children. As he holds down the fort, Uncle Buck displays rather unusual habits like cooking a very weird breakfast, and also jumbo sized pancakes for one of the children's, Miles (Macaulay Culkin), birthday [sweet], doing the laundry like hanging the clothes from a rotating ceiling fan as a blowdryer blows in their direction, facing off verbally with the school principal, keeping a young girl-crazy dude in check, and somehow managing to keep his smokebomb, backfiring car intact. It's indeed silly. All the while, even with his lovable bizareness, the children learn important life values, particularly the eldest and rebellious neice (Jean Louisa Kelly). Buck manages to pull it off impressing everyone from the children's returning parents to his girlfriend (Amy Madigan). It's an outrageously funny picture. There's something for everyone of all ages though not particularly aimed at a children's audience, but they'd enjoy it too.The DVD picture looks quite colorful and sharp and so's the surround sound. About the widescreen picture is what I have a quibble over. I saw the VHS version some time ago, and I remembered how certain parts of the movie looked on that in comparison to this DVD. It looks like the VHS picture was taken and the top and bottom were cut off to get black bars there to make it look like widescreen. For example, when Buck is in the kitchen singing ""Tweedlee Dee"" with the radio, there's a shot of him from the back. The floor was in the shot, but on the DVD it looks as if it was cut off. You can still enjoy the movie for this is only a minor quibble. Another may be the limited special features, not even a theatrical trailer. The production notes about the movie are very informative, I must say. The different language soundtracks cannot be changed while the movie is playing; you have to press the menu button and change it there if you desired to suddenly hear it in the Spanish or French that's provided. This DVD release was from back in the day when DVDs were relatively new so maybe that kind of adjustment where languages could be switched over while the movie was playing came later.

For I love comedies and stories about unusual families. Watching the movie I was reminded of one of my own uncles. John Candy gives a young, fresh and hillarous performance as the never-can-do-right uncle who wins the love and attention of his family.The children are all different- from fowled mouthed-miserable teen Tia, to tattling Miles, and little darling Maisy- The children are all adjusting to a new home, new school, and new town after moving from big city Indiannapolis to the Burbs. Of course the kids are more then a little resentful including the eldest smart-mouthed teen. The kids are even more miserable when Uncle Buck- a uncle they hardly know comes to watch them when mom & dad have to leave for a family emergency. Buck who can never keep a job and has no responsibilities is suddenly thrown into a ""Mr. Mom"" scenario. The younger children love him and begin to pick up some of his annoying habits from his fowl language to his disgusting eating habits. Buck, also enchants him with his pizza size birthday breakfast pancake. Buck changes, grows and learns from these kids particularly the meaning of family.In the movie Uncle Buck- John Candy is funny in situations such as dealing with parent-principal conferences. What I found particularly charming about the movie were certain moments in which Buck is cute as the ""stand-in"" dad... Such as when he mouths off to Maisy's principal. From roasting laundry in the microwave to scaring off Tia's too-fast boyfriend- this movie is an endearment of the importance of loving family no matter what- and falling in love with UNCLE BUCK is what this movie is all about.Buck is enchanting...and although there are moments the story is a little dry or slap-sticky this is a movie I'd rent for the kids on family movie night or those who enjoy family comedies!

I didn't see too much about Tia not getting along with her mother too much earlier in the film, so the ending was a bit weird for me. I have to say John Candy did play the character of Uncle Buck very well, and he was enjoyable to watch - even if I do get him constantly muddled up with John Goodman.Look out for Jay Underwood playing Bug, particularly if you've watched The Boy Who Could Fly.

Since that time, I have probably seen the movie 25-30 times and never get tired of the comedic genious that was John Candy and the fabulous story-teller that is John Hughes.  Simply put, this film delivers!Buck is a bit of a screwup. He has no job, no wife, no kids.  But, he enjoys life.  He bowls, has a girlfriend of 8 years, loves golf and makes his living on tips he gets on horses.  Things are going as usual, until he gets a call from his brother late on night, asking that Buck come over to watch his kids, while him and his wife attend to her sick father.  Buck jumps at the opportunity and the hilarity begins.This is truly one of the best comedies of the 90's, as John Candy simply delivers one of his best performances.  The cast also includes a pre ""Home Alone"" Makauly Caulkin(I have no idea how to spell his name) and the ever great Laurie Metcalf(""Roseanne"").  I'm not typically a big fan of comedies that have a heavy child prescence, but this one is really funny.  John Candy works on screen so well with kids that I'm really amazed.  I mean, it's difficult for actors to ""time"" or get comedic routines to be funny when they are both adults, but when you have to do it with a kid, it's even tougher, yer Caulkin and Candy are GREAT!This is really a must-watch film if you've never seen it and I'll even say it's a must-buy film; because, you will watch it over and over and over!Oh yeah, and being from Chicago, I love the shots of the city.  As usual, Hughes focuses on the areas people actual live in, rather than the downtown(business) areas where most directors concentrate simply because you can see the Sears Tower and the EL in the background.

58419,A1KVUPBV07ZCJL,0783227388,Phil Elmore,"[0, 0]","""Uncle Buck"" (1989) is one of those films that you only appreciate when you get older.  I remember seeing it years ago; I thought nothing about it at the time.  Now that I'm the same age as Candy's character (he died tragically young at 44, while Buck was written as a 40-year-old) I can't help but identify with the protagonist of the film.  I like to think my life is a lot more ""together"" than Buck's, but it's the attitude, the tone of the film, that really reaches me.Buck, for all his flaws -- a desire to be free from day-to-day work, a weakness for gambling, and his slovenly personal habits -- can be defined best as ""well meaning.""  He's clumsy, he's awkward, and he's often embarrassing, but he WANTS to help.  He's happy to provide assistance where it is required, sensitive to the hurt of others (even though he's not always quick on the uptake), and willing to set aside his personal issues when the well-being of a loved one is on the line.As Buck slowly wins over his nieces and nephew, he proves himself an able, if unconventional, parental figure.  He is strict about the important stuff, like preventing his eldest niece from getting into trouble with her boyfriend (including public displays of affection with a boy Buck instantly identifies as trouble).  He's easygoing about everything else (perhaps too much so, given the mess this makes).  He goes out of his way to make his nephew happy for his birthday. He treats the children like equals, in fact -- which, on some mental level, they are, given Buck's childish streak -- until they run afoul of the boundaries, whereupon he makes very clear to them what he will and won't accept.The Buck character is really a triumph of confidence and self-esteem.  Buck's an unabashed fat man -- a big, loud bull in a china shop who doesn't care what people think of him.  He has no fear whatsoever (except of a day spent behind a desk).  He'll march into the kids' school to contend with a stuffed-shirt teacher and tell her off as soon as he's sure of where he stands.  He'll punch a drunken clown in the face without hesitation.  He'll walk into a party full of hostile kids to rescue his niece -- and he's not afraid to employ power tools and physical intimidation toward that goal.Most of the people in ""Uncle Buck"" are afraid of Buck, in fact, which is unusual because he's fat.  He's a comic character and supposed to be amusing.  A large component of that amusement is the slapstick physical comedy of him blundering around in his over-sized way; we do not afford to fat people any regard for their ability to hurt us.  Yet there is also an acknowledgment, among Buck's fellow characters (and never spoken explicitly to the viewer) that Buck is not a man to be trifled with.  The only people who get the better of him are people who are no threat, for whom he becomes the butt of jokes.The movie, ultimately, conveys an upbeat message.  It tells us that there are people in our lives who are not perfect -- emotionally, physically, and even mentally -- who, if they mean well and if they have courage, will always come through for us when it counts.  John Candy's early death was a great loss to film and to comedy.

The late John Candy's comic timing and execution of his jokes are perfect and he gives the best performance of his career in this wonderful movie.Called to watch three children during a family emergency, Buck wants to prove to his girlfriend he can be responsible. As a guardian, he clashes with Tia, the rebellious teenage daughter and bonds with two smaller kids who can't get enough of the loveable lout. Look for a great Macaulay Culkin and the girl from Sleepless in Seattle as the younger kids Buck takes care of. Candy has great chemistry with the smaller kids. Also look for Laurie Metcalf from Roseanne in a hilarious cameo as a wacky neighbor.While Buck has trouble in the beginning, he soon starts handling business. Great scenes include him making huge pancakes for Mac's birthday party, punching out a drunken clown, taking on a nasty school principal, and embarrassing Tia's punk boyfriend Bug. (The scene at the party with the power drill on the bedroom door is great, but the hatchet scene is a classic!) By the end of the movie Uncle Buck is Da man proving he's responsible and showing his girl a new side of him.The acting in this movie is top notch and Hughes direction is solid. I love the cinematography; Hughes makes some beautiful pictures to tell his great story. I love the shot of the car driving away from the high school! I see this film as the one where Hughes transitioned from angst filled teen movies to slapstick filled comedies like ""Home Alone"".

John Candy has one of his finest opportunities in this film by John Hughes about a perpetual screw-up who gets his act together enough to watch over his brother's kids effectively. He does so effectively in this 1989 film, and is considered by me to be one of the funniest movies ever made! Hughes's direction is not as focused as it was only a few years before, but there's no mistaking his touch. I've yet to see a bad Candy movie, They are all outstanding, and Uncle Buck is one of his best. My personal favorite Candy movie is Who's Hharry Crumb? which I also recommend you checking out. Macaulay Culkin is in it, and if you haven't heard, he is acting again. Unfortuneately Candy passed away, and it is ashamed, because he is the only actor in movie history who was never in a bad movie.
