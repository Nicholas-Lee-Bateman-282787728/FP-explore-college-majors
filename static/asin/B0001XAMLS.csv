You have waited and now you, me and all the LOTL fans have been rewarded. Our stories are the same. Every Sat we gathered in front of the TV for the Kroft shows (and the Shazam power hour). But it was one show that stood out above the rest. Land of the Lost. After getting my DVD set in the mail I could not wait to just sit down and watch these classics again. To take me back to my childhood. What I realized while watching them was that not only did it take me back but how good this show really was. The writing for a Sat morning kids show was fantastic. It was intelligent, and the story kept your interest. It still does. It has only gotten better with time in my opinion. I also realized something else while watching these. How much this show had influnced so many other shows or movies. Star Wars for instance. Think about it. Wookies = Paku, Enik = Obi Wan,  Will & Holly = Luke & Leia. I am sure Mr. Lucas had to be influnced by this show when making Star Wars. It makes sense if you consider this was the most popular show of it's time for kids and Lucas was writing his future masterpiece around this time. hehehe maybe it is just me. None the less it is a wonderful treat to have these back in our lives and now anytime we want we can go back to the Land of the Lost. Now bring on seasons 2 & 3!!

The simple technology of the 1970's was used to create the stories of a father, his son and daughter as they survive in a prehistoric world of dinosaurs and other creatures lost in time.

This show fascinated me when I was young because the some of the storylines were dark and mysterious. In watching these dvds there were several episodes that I had long forgotten about but now remember.Everyone has their favorite episodes, and there a couple that stand out for me. One is called ""The Search"". In this particular episode, the Marshall's are experimenting with crystals they found. Rick puts three crystals together and is shocked with high voltage. Holly manages to get their Dad back to the cave and Will goes in search of Enik for desperate help.Will finds Enik, but Enik is frantically in the process of opening the time door back to his world. Will pleads to Enik to come to the cave to help Rick, but Enik says this may be his ONLY chance to make it back to his home through the time door. So the time sequence begins and we see many different worlds and universes flash through at the time door. But amazingly the time door stops momentarily at the Marshall family time and home of California on Earth. This is one of the high points of the entire LOTL series, for now Will has to make the ultimate spur of the moment decision of a lifetime: walk through the time door back home or staying back with his family in the deadly land of the lost and taking a chance on never getting home.And then there is ""Circle"". This episode can be mind boggling if you are not careful. Enik has discovered that an unexplainable paradox is occurring with the time doorway, which is locked in on the waterfall event horizon. This involves the rule of space matter and how the Marshall family first got to the Land of the Lost. Over the course of most of the first season the Marshalls are believing that they simply fell through a time doorway over the waterfall... but it turns out it is not quite that simple. If you listen closely in episode one ""Cha-ka"", Rick states that he thinks they have fell through a hole in space. His statement is confirmed by Enik in ""Circle"", because at the waterfall the Marshalls did not fall through a time doorway nor was killed - therefore they should not even be in the Land of the Lost, which is keeping the time door from functioning properly. So to fix the time doorway the Marshall family needs to leave a place where, according to the law of space and time travel, they don't even exist...if that is possible.Thanks to Rhino for releasing this box set...looking forward to season two""Ginactik, my friends""",5,...and plunged them down a thousand feet below...,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,2600,"['started', 'September', '1974', 'was', 'there', 'kid', 'watching', 'original', 'airing', 'Land', 'Lost', 'season', 'one', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'show', 'fascinated', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'storylines', 'were', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'watching', 'dvds', 'were', 'several', 'episodes', 'had', 'long', 'forgotten', 'now', 'remember.Everyone', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'there', 'couple', 'stand', 'out', 'One', 'called', 'Search', 'particular', 'episode', 'Marshall', 'are', 'experimenting', 'crystals', 'found', 'Rick', 'three', 'crystals', 'together', 'shocked', 'high', 'voltage', 'Holly', 'get', 'Dad', 'back', 'cave', 'Will', 'search', 'Enik', 'desperate', 'help.Will', 'Enik', 'Enik', 'frantically', 'process', 'opening', 'time', 'door', 'back', 'world', 'Will', 'pleads', 'Enik', 'come', 'cave', 'help', 'Rick', 'Enik', 'may', 'be', 'ONLY', 'chance', 'make', 'back', 'home', 'time', 'door', 'time', 'sequence', 'begins', 'see', 'many', 'different', 'worlds', 'universes', 'flash', 'time', 'door', 'amazingly', 'time', 'door', 'stops', 'momentarily', 'Marshall', 'family', 'time', 'home', 'California', 'Earth', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'entire', 'LOTL', 'series', 'now', 'Will', 'make', 'ultimate', 'spur', 'moment', 'decision', 'lifetime', 'walk', 'time', 'door', 'back', 'home', 'staying', 'back', 'family', 'deadly', 'land', 'lost', 'taking', 'chance', 'never', 'getting', 'home.And', 'then', 'Circle', 'episode', 'can', 'be', 'mind', 'boggling', 'are', 'not', 'careful', 'Enik', 'discovered', 'unexplainable', 'paradox', 'occurring', 'time', 'doorway', 'locked', 'waterfall', 'event', 'horizon', 'rule', 'space', 'matter', 'how', 'Marshall', 'family', 'first', 'got', 'Land', 'Lost', 'course', 'most', 'first', 'season', 'Marshalls', 'are', 'believing', 'simply', 'fell', 'time', 'doorway', 'waterfall', 'out', 'not', 'quite', 'simple', 'listen', 'closely', 'episode', 'one', 'Cha-ka', 'Rick', 'have', 'fell', 'hole', 'space', 'statement', 'confirmed', 'Enik', 'Circle', 'waterfall', 'Marshalls', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'time', 'doorway', 'was', 'killed', 'should', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'Land', 'Lost', 'keeping', 'time', 'door', 'functioning', 'properly', 'So', 'fix', 'time', 'Marshall', 'family', 'leave', 'place', 'where', 'according', 'law', 'space', 'time', 'travel', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'possible.Thanks', 'Rhino', 'releasing', 'box', 'set', 'looking', 'forward', 'season', 'two', 'Ginactik', 'friends']",N/A
816013,ACVBZF3GK3O45,B0001XAMLS,C. Davis,"[0, 0]","When I was a young child, this show came on Saturday mornings.  I could only occasionally get up early enough to watch it and often I was so sleepy I was unable to stay awake for the entire episode. So, often I would look at the pylons, Enoch the Andalusian, or whatever and wonder.  Mostly I would wonder where that had come from and what is going on.So, when the opportunity presented itself to watch the episodes in order from start to finish, I purchased the series from Amazon Instant Video.Other then the special effects (which are bad even by 1974 standards), this series stands up to anything that is on TV today to include Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Lost, or Breaking Bad. Plus it is written for children so it is completely family friendly. In terms of the special effects, you just have to push the ""I believe"" button in your mind and accept it.The series explores the adventures of the Marshall family when they find themselves in a bizarre world. Obviously, this idea is derived heavily from Edgar Rice Burroughs or Jules Verne, but the idea seems to never get old as it is used in multiple books, TV shows, and movies.There are basically two types of episodes. First, how do the Marshals survive in the Land of the Lost? Food, shelter, water, land navigation, dinosaurs, and dealing with either the Sleestacks, the lizard descendents of the Andalusians, or the Pakuni, the missing link dudes that are alternatively comical and menacing. Second, what is the back story of the Land of the Lost? Is the Land of the Lost a natural phenomenon or is it an artificially constructed place? What properties do the crystals have?  What are those pylons? I hesitate to provide answers in this review, but discovering them is part of the joy of watching this show. Some episodes have elements of both themes, but mostly these ideas stay separate.The last episode of the first season, perhaps, was written to be an evergreen episode that could be considered the last episode whenever the producers decided to end the series.However, the third season throws out the baby with the bathwater so to speak. It is almost like a completely different series with many of the ideas and plot devices developed in the first two seasons discarded. Even the father from the first two seasons disappears and is replaced by his brother!?The other issue is that as I watched this series as a 40+ year old man, I couldn't believe that the father was letting his children do such dangerous things. Heck with only three people, it would make perfect sense to say that no one goes anywhere without the other two people in tow.Regardless, the first two seasons are as good as any television show that you might want to watch.  The third season, while not as good, is still better them half the shows that you might care to watch.I strongly recommend this show to anyone who liked the TV series Lost or Edgar Rice Burroughs novels.",5,LIKE THE TV SHOW LOST BUT FOR CHILDREN,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,2909,"['When', 'was', 'young', 'child', 'show', 'came', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'could', 'only', 'occasionally', 'get', 'up', 'early', 'enough', 'watch', 'often', 'was', 'so', 'sleepy', 'was', 'unable', 'stay', 'awake', 'entire', 'episode', 'So', 'often', 'would', 'look', 'pylons', 'Enoch', 'Andalusian', 'wonder', 'Mostly', 'would', 'wonder', 'where', 'had', 'come', 'what', 'going', 'on.So', 'when', 'opportunity', 'presented', 'watch', 'episodes', 'order', 'start', 'finish', 'purchased', 'series', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video.Other', 'then', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'bad', 'even', '1974', 'standards', 'series', 'up', 'anything', 'TV', 'today', 'include', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Lost', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'written', 'children', 'completely', 'family', 'friendly', 'terms', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'have', 'push', 'believe', 'button', 'mind', 'accept', 'it.The', 'series', 'adventures', 'Marshall', 'family', 'when', 'find', 'bizarre', 'world', 'Obviously', 'idea', 'derived', 'heavily', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'idea', 'never', 'get', 'old', 'used', 'multiple', 'books', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies.There', 'are', 'basically', 'two', 'types', 'episodes', 'First', 'how', 'do', 'Marshals', 'survive', 'Land', 'Lost', 'Food', 'shelter', 'water', 'land', 'navigation', 'dinosaurs', 'dealing', 'Sleestacks', 'lizard', 'descendents', 'Andalusians', 'Pakuni', 'missing', 'link', 'dudes', 'are', 'alternatively', 'comical', 'menacing', 'Second', 'what', 'back', 'story', 'Land', 'Lost', 'Land', 'Lost', 'natural', 'phenomenon', 'artificially', 'constructed', 'place', 'What', 'properties', 'do', 'crystals', 'have', 'What', 'are', 'pylons', 'hesitate', 'provide', 'answers', 'review', 'discovering', 'part', 'joy', 'watching', 'show', 'episodes', 'have', 'elements', 'themes', 'mostly', 'ideas', 'stay', 'separate.The', 'last', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'perhaps', 'was', 'written', 'be', 'evergreen', 'episode', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'last', 'episode', 'whenever', 'producers', 'decided', 'end', 'series.However', 'third', 'season', 'out', 'baby', 'bathwater', 'so', 'speak', 'almost', 'completely', 'different', 'series', 'many', 'ideas', 'plot', 'devices', 'developed', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'discarded', 'Even', 'father', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'disappears', 'replaced', 'brother', 'other', 'issue', 'watched', 'series', '40+', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'father', 'was', 'letting', 'children', 'do', 'such', 'dangerous', 'things', 'Heck', 'only', 'three', 'people', 'would', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'say', 'one', 'anywhere', 'other', 'two', 'people', 'tow.Regardless', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'television', 'show', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'third', 'season', 'not', 'good', 'still', 'better', 'shows', 'might', 'care', 'watch.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'liked', 'TV', 'series', 'Lost', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'novels']",N/A

816016,A1HJZL0WKCOTSF,B0001XAMLS,"Dan ""Longsword""","[5, 16]","Dinosaurs have always fascinated kids. Even before they are old enough to realize that these steroid-sized lizards are nothing but evolutionary bad news-what with their tendency to eat humans and decompose into environment-polluting petroleum products-bratlings bray at the sight of a stegosaurus and whiz themselves over pterodactyls in flight.For this critic, his prehistoric fix came at the hands of a foreign narrative about four teenage friends who visit the Museum of Natural History in New York. While rowing out into Central Park Lake, they stumble upon a mysterious entrance and end up in a world of Czech Republic stop-motion monsters. Originally a 1955 film entitled Cesta do praveku (gotta love the Slavs), American TV serialized the film, added the necessary Western prologue and dubbing, and offered it to local kid shows nationwide.As this reviewer over-romanticizes it, in between episodes of The Funny Company and Clutch Cargo, Garfield Goose and Friends would show the newly named Journey to the Beginning of Time, and at his precocious age and inclination, it was mandatory viewing. As the detailed dinos herked and jerked their way across the screen, the slowly developing short hairs of this entertainment-starved six-year-old (this was 1967, mind you) would start to tingle. One of his most vivid memories was of the final episode. After trying every manner of maneuver to leave the precarious primeval plane, a couple of the kids managed to make it back through the original opening...only to discover that they have moved even further back in time, to the actual beginning of the universe (tell me this didn't mess with many an adolescent's agitprop attention span).A little less than a decade later, another episodic adventure into the realm of the raptor was instrumental in providing children with enough fright fodder to keep their beds in an ever-constant state of dampness.

816018,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,B0001XAMLS,drebbles,"[3, 3]","""Land of the Lost"" is a classic example of what Saturday morning children's television shows were like in the `70's. Forest Ranger Rick Marshall and his two children, Will and Holly, fall through a hole in time and land in a world full of menacing dinosaurs and evil creatures known as ""Sleestaks"".  The Marshall's learn how to survive in this strange land, with the help of Chaka and his people, the monkey-like Pakuni's, all the while looking for a way back home.One of the things I love about DVD's (especially the one's put out by Rhino) is that they offer a chance to revisit my childhood. I loved ""Land of the Lost"" as a child (actually a young teenager) and I loved watching the first season all over again as an adult. Yes, thirty years later, the special effects (especially the dinosaurs) are lame, the sets are cheesy, and the acting over the top at times, but that's part of the fun of watching the show. We know the dinosaurs aren't real and the Sleestaks are lumbering fools who can't shoot an arrow straight and I loved every minute of it! Most of the episodes were okay, and a couple were excruciating to watch, but there are some really inventive episodes including ""Album"", ""The Search"", ""Elsewhen"" and the season ending episode ""Circle"".The bonus features are also worth watching. My favorites were the two episodes where Wesley Eure and Kathy Coleman did the commentary. They recall the show fondly, give some interesting trivia about the episodes, and make some hilarious comments about the acting and special effects. Eure is especially funny and does not hesitate to poke fun at himself.Great fun!",5,Lots of Fun,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,1620,"['Land', 'Lost', 'classic', 'example', 'what', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'children', 'television', 'shows', 'were', '70', 'Forest', 'Ranger', 'Rick', 'Marshall', 'two', 'children', 'Will', 'Holly', 'fall', 'hole', 'time', 'land', 'world', 'full', 'menacing', 'dinosaurs', 'evil', 'creatures', 'known', 'Sleestaks', 'Marshall', 'learn', 'how', 'survive', 'strange', 'land', 'help', 'Chaka', 'people', 'monkey-like', 'Pakuni', 'while', 'looking', 'way', 'back', 'home.One', 'things', 'love', 'DVD', 'especially', 'one', 'put', 'out', 'Rhino', 'offer', 'chance', 'revisit', 'childhood', 'loved', 'Land', 'Lost', 'child', 'actually', 'young', 'teenager', 'loved', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'over', 'again', 'adult', 'Yes', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'dinosaurs', 'are', 'lame', 'sets', 'are', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'top', 'times', 'part', 'fun', 'watching', 'show', 'know', 'dinosaurs', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'Sleestaks', 'are', 'lumbering', 'fools', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'arrow', 'straight', 'loved', 'minute', 'Most', 'episodes', 'were', 'okay', 'couple', 'were', 'excruciating', 'watch', 'are', 'really', 'inventive', 'episodes', 'including', 'Album', 'Search', 'Elsewhen', 'season', 'ending', 'episode', 'Circle', '.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'worth', 'watching', 'favorites', 'were', 'two', 'episodes', 'where', 'Wesley', 'Eure', 'Kathy', 'Coleman', 'did', 'commentary', 'recall', 'show', 'fondly', 'give', 'interesting', 'trivia', 'episodes', 'make', 'hilarious', 'comments', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'Eure', 'especially', 'funny', 'not', 'hesitate', 'poke', 'fun', 'himself.Great', 'fun']",N/A

It was everything a little kid could want, basically a live action dinosaur adventure.Land of the Lost worked because everyone involved with it from the directors, to the actors, to the production/EFX people took the series VERY seriously. The plot lines were well thought up and even WAYYY too deep for little 6-11 year olds, involving death, deceit, honor, and brotherhood. The dinosaur Special effects were state of the art in the 70's and still hold up well today. They are very ""King Kong 33"" like, in that the dinos do look alive, if the tiniest bit animated. The ""muppet"" close-ups look fake, but are actually charming in a cool/cheesy ""70's Sid Marty & Kroff, kinda way. The sets were amazing, and the artwork fantastic, and even the ""Pylon"" effects worked well within the plotlines.But what drove the children and the parents back every Saturday AM was the characters of Marshall Will and Holly. There was genuine rapport, and love, and they made you believe in them, even if they were a bit overdramatic at the time. If dinos and Sleestaks were chasing you, you'd be overdramatic as well. Enoch the Sleestak was WAYYY ahead of his time, as was this series. His philosophies and the plotlines involving him went over my head as a kid, but as an adult, I am REALLY enjoying great scriptwriting.Be sure and catch the cool extras, including the live interviews with Wesley Eure, and Kathy Coleman, all grown up, and every bit as beautiful as we knew she would be. And watch as she and Welsey cant seem to keep their hands off each other, or their eyes off each other, watch the classic body language, and you can tell that little 11 year old Kathy had a MAJOR crush on the 70's Hearthrob/Soap Star Will when she was a kid, and basically still does, and I saw it coming a mile away, but she manages to kiss him by the end of the interview, and not exactly a sisterly kiss either.

They also did work on &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; for those that remember that sci-fi show. These legends were called upon once again to work in this landmark television series for kids that was a part of Saturday morning programs meant to stimulate the imagination and entertain. There were also quality writers gathered from Science fiction to write some of the plots that you will see here in this first season of shows. In describing the show it is much like a children's version of a Doctor Who adventure. Short on budget but excellent in imaginative designs and well written plots. So, like Doctor Who, you have to ignore the low budget stage pieces and let your imagination along with the dialog rule how you will judge it. The most interesting and innovative idea are a race of &quot;silurians&quot; known as &quot;The Sleestak&quot;. One intelligent version of the Sleestak controls travel through time and we see experiments using &quot;crystals&quot; (ala' George Pal) as a means of power to alter the time universe.

In America in the 70s, this genre was dominated by Sid and Marty Croft. I'm pretty sure ""Land of the Lost"" was their best venture. This thing figures prominently in my childhood memories; I remember being mesmerized by the dinosaurs (all smart kids love dinosaurs), the scary Sleestack monsters, and the spooky Pylons and Enoch's ancient race that built the place. It was pretty compelling science fiction for a kid, and the concepts pushed my little brain to the very limits of wonder and comprehension. I realized now, from watching the series as an adult, the reason it was so damn good was it was written by people like D.C. Fontana, David Gerrold, Ben Bova and Larry Niven; some of the greatest science fiction writers of all time. Walter Koenig (Chekov from Star Trek) also wrote an episode, and did some interesting commentary on the bonus tracks. Like all kids science fiction shows of the era, the special effects are pretty budget (though some of the Dinosaur scenes hold up pretty well), and the acting is pretty hammy. It's great that most of the actors who played the main characters got to make commentary track making fun of themselves. Who knew Cha-ka was a black belt in Karate at 9? Even though this is a kids show, it holds up pretty well. I've shown it to adults from other countries, and they found it reasonably entertaining. I'm not sure if modern kids would like it, but I intend to give it a shot with my younger relations one of these days. It's got a lot of good lessons for kids, and Rick Marshall is an admirable father figure.Of course, if you want to watch it with a modern 21st century eye, you'd be horrified at Rick Marshall for taking his kids on a rafting trip in the wilderness, giving them big knives, then letting them run around by themselves without adult supervision when there are large carnivorous reptiles about. Even worse, when he puts them in dangerous situations under adult supervision. Heck, the fact that he didn't have Holly in a home schooling program, and Will in therapy for being sexist is probably horrifying to some modern parents. O tempora! Even if you believe such things, you should show this to your kids to show them the way things were in more innocent times, when it was OK to run around with your kids in a dinosaur infested lost city, attempting time travel and such.I'll probably get all the other seasons eventually, but the first one is a big win.",5,Here and I thought this was lost forever,1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,2479,"['live', 'action', 'kids', 'adventure', 'show', 'sort', 'dying', 'art', 'America', '70s', 'genre', 'was', 'dominated', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Croft', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Land', 'Lost', 'was', 'best', 'venture', 'thing', 'prominently', 'childhood', 'memories', 'remember', 'being', 'mesmerized', 'dinosaurs', 'smart', 'kids', 'love', 'dinosaurs', 'scary', 'Sleestack', 'monsters', 'spooky', 'Pylons', 'Enoch', 'ancient', 'race', 'built', 'place', 'was', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'science', 'fiction', 'kid', 'concepts', 'pushed', 'little', 'brain', 'very', 'limits', 'wonder', 'comprehension', 'realized', 'now', 'watching', 'series', 'adult', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'damn', 'good', 'was', 'was', 'written', 'people', 'D.C.', 'Fontana', 'David', 'Gerrold', 'Ben', 'Bova', 'Larry', 'Niven', 'greatest', 'science', 'fiction', 'writers', 'time', 'Walter', 'Koenig', 'Chekov', 'Star', 'Trek', 'also', 'wrote', 'episode', 'did', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'kids', 'science', 'fiction', 'shows', 'era', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'budget', 'Dinosaur', 'scenes', 'hold', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'acting', 'pretty', 'hammy', 'great', 'most', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'main', 'characters', 'got', 'make', 'commentary', 'track', 'making', 'fun', 'Who', 'knew', 'Cha-ka', 'was', 'black', 'belt', 'Karate', '9', 'Even', 'kids', 'show', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'adults', 'other', 'countries', 'found', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'modern', 'kids', 'would', 'like', 'intend', 'give', 'shot', 'younger', 'relations', 'one', 'days', 'got', 'lot', 'good', 'lessons', 'kids', 'Rick', 'Marshall', 'admirable', 'father', 'figure.Of', 'course', 'want', 'watch', 'modern', '21st', 'century', 'eye', ""'d"", 'be', 'horrified', 'Rick', 'Marshall', 'taking', 'kids', 'rafting', 'trip', 'wilderness', 'giving', 'big', 'knives', 'then', 'letting', 'run', 'around', 'adult', 'supervision', 'when', 'are', 'large', 'carnivorous', 'reptiles', 'Even', 'worse', 'when', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'adult', 'supervision', 'Heck', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Holly', 'home', 'schooling', 'program', 'Will', 'therapy', 'being', 'sexist', 'probably', 'horrifying', 'modern', 'parents', 'O', 'tempora', 'Even', 'believe', 'such', 'things', 'should', 'show', 'kids', 'show', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'more', 'innocent', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'OK', 'run', 'around', 'kids', 'dinosaur', 'infested', 'lost', 'city', 'attempting', 'time', 'travel', 'such.I', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'other', 'seasons', 'eventually', 'first', 'one', 'big', 'win']",N/A
816041,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B0001XAMLS,Servo,"[10, 10]","From September 1974 to November 1976 countless young Saturday morning viewers (myself included) of the 70s were spellbound by the innovative live-action series Land of the Lost. Created and produced by puppeteer brothers Sid & Marty Krofft, the show was about a forest ranger and his two children who fall through a time portal and find themselves in a prehistoric world. Ranger Rick Marshall (Spencer Milligan), his son Will (Wesley Eure) and daughter Holly (Kathy Coleman) encounter dinosaurs (aptly named ""Grumpy,"" ""Dopey,"" and ""Big Alice"") and Cha-ka (Philip Paley) and his apelike race, the Paku. But most memorable from LOTL (just ask any fan of the show) were the Sleestaks, a lumbering, hissing race of reptilian creatures who were performed by Dave Greenwood, John Lambert and Bill Laimbeer (of Detroit Pistons fame).As impressive as the special effects were back in the 70s, today they are considered as primitive as the dinosaurs that appear in the Land of the Lost itself. But don't be surprised if you find yourself appreciating the Ray Harryhausen-like techniques & effects and those surreal backgrounds, as it is very painstaking work with an end result that is uniquely satisfying. The cast was solid and gave strong performances. It's uncanny how the show puts the viewer in the Land of the Lost, which I've always regarded as ""the ultimate camping trip"". From the Marshall's cool above-ground, above-danger cave and their mirror ""communicators,"" to their day-to-day adventures in the prehistoric world, the show was in a class by itself to which the inferior 90s Land of the Lost update paled in comparison.The first season is comprised of 17 episodes, one of which (""The Stranger"") was written by Walter Koenig (Ensign Pavel Chekov from ""Star Trek""). Rhino Video's previous 4-episode Land of the Lost DVD featured nice picture quality (for an early 70s print), 2.0 mono mix and 2 extras: an interview with the Krofft brothers themselves, and a 'look back' with Kathy Coleman (Holly) and Philip Paley (Cha-Ka), so as far as treatment and extras go you should expect no less for this long-awaited classic collection.

816042,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B0001XAMLS,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[59, 63]","While these shows originally aired on Saturday mornings, I never knew about them showing at that time slot - I grew up seeing them re-run after school and during the summers in the afternoons. Of all the shows on television, this was my all time favorite and one of my most fondly remembered.One thing I really appreciated about these shows even at age 6 when they first aired, was how deep, engaging and non-patronizing they were. These were not simply ""kid"" shows. This was real in-your-face science fiction at full throttle - where kids were treated with respect. I never felt talked down to as an audience member or as a child watching these shows. They were mentally engaging and it was easy to overlook some of the less-than-stellar effects which were still pretty advanced for their time.At age 6 I knew that the dinosaurs were claymation. Heck, Grumpy the T-Rex didn't even have a throat and he had a mouth more like Kermit the Frog than a menacing dino - but I didn't care. The sound effects, the music, the eyes - all gave me the creeps.The show's premise is utterly brilliant: a family is on a camping expedition and has all their camping gear above their raft as they paddle ""high on the rapids."" An earthquake hits and they plummet down a waterfall to certain death only to find they have somehow entered a time-door of sorts to another time and dimension where even the weather and gravity are artifically controlled, dinosaurs run amok and the veggies are freakin' huge.Rick Marshall, his son Will and daughter Holly are alone in this utter wilderness with no telephone, no TV, no toilets... somehow they manage to survive for years without threadbare or stained/ripped clothes and even find time make friends with the natives and learn the Pakuni language.It's not just a 1970s Jurassic Park, either - there are all sorts of weird things going on - the half-insect/half-lizard ""men"" known as the Sleestak are second only to the Tiki god in ""Trilogy of Terror"" on the fear meter. Their eerie hisses made my heart go a flutter. There are exploding crystals, astronauts parachuting in, all sorts of interestingly whacky sci-fi stuff.The acting of Spencer Milligan, Kathy Coleman and Wesley Eure cannot be overstated. Their unique abilities to be believable made the show believable. Were there cheesy scenes? You bet! A bit over acting here & there? Yes! BUT - this was a believable family doing the best to stay sane in an insane environment.The DVD has commentaries from the stars that will have you holding your gut laughing. An interview with the now adult Kathy Coleman and Wesley Eure is awesome. They loved working on the show and cherish the memories as much as those of us who grew up watching the series. The back stories on what went on behind the scenes as well as their take on certain themes and characters is utterly priceless.For decades, I have pined for this show and whenever I've run into 30-somethings and the topic of this show would come up, I have always heard the comments of either ""I LOVED THAT SHOW!"" or ""Those Sleestak scared the pee out of me!"" or both.The show was so well thought out. Professional voice talent went into the masked/make-uped characters. A linguist from UCLA invented the Pakuni language to make it grammatical and believable. Basketball stars of the 70s played the Sleestak... and the best sci-fi writers of the era wrote for the show, including D.C. Fontana and Walter Koenig.The commentaries are a hoot, and priceless in my own estimation. I love this DVD set! I had gotten the VHS version of the shows, but quickly replaced them when this DVD set came out with the commentaries and interviews with the cast. The only thing I'd like to see would be out-takes, home movies and period photos of the cast out of make up, etc. Other than that, flawless - a fantastic job by Rhino - God bless them one and all. I cannot say enough how much joy and nostalgia these shows have brought into my home.",5,a dream come true,1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,3955,"['shows', 'originally', 'aired', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'never', 'knew', 'showing', 'time', 'slot', 'grew', 'up', 'seeing', 're-run', 'school', 'summers', 'afternoons', 'shows', 'television', 'was', 'time', 'favorite', 'one', 'most', 'fondly', 'remembered.One', 'thing', 'really', 'appreciated', 'shows', 'even', 'age', '6', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'was', 'how', 'deep', 'engaging', 'non-patronizing', 'were', 'were', 'not', 'simply', 'kid', 'shows', 'was', 'real', 'in-your-face', 'science', 'fiction', 'full', 'throttle', 'where', 'kids', 'were', 'treated', 'respect', 'never', 'felt', 'talked', 'down', 'audience', 'member', 'child', 'watching', 'shows', 'were', 'mentally', 'engaging', 'was', 'easy', 'overlook', 'less-than-stellar', 'effects', 'were', 'still', 'pretty', 'advanced', 'time.At', 'age', '6', 'knew', 'dinosaurs', 'were', 'claymation', 'Heck', 'Grumpy', 'T-Rex', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'throat', 'had', 'mouth', 'more', 'Kermit', 'Frog', 'menacing', 'dino', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'sound', 'effects', 'music', 'eyes', 'gave', 'creeps.The', 'show', 'premise', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'family', 'camping', 'expedition', 'camping', 'gear', 'raft', 'paddle', 'high', 'rapids', 'earthquake', 'hits', 'plummet', 'down', 'waterfall', 'certain', 'death', 'only', 'find', 'have', 'somehow', 'entered', 'time-door', 'sorts', 'time', 'dimension', 'where', 'even', 'weather', 'gravity', 'are', 'artifically', 'controlled', 'dinosaurs', 'run', 'amok', 'veggies', 'are', 'freakin', 'huge.Rick', 'Marshall', 'son', 'Will', 'daughter', 'Holly', 'are', 'alone', 'utter', 'wilderness', 'telephone', 'TV', 'toilets', 'somehow', 'manage', 'survive', 'years', 'threadbare', 'stained/ripped', 'clothes', 'even', 'find', 'time', 'make', 'friends', 'natives', 'learn', 'Pakuni', 'language.It', 'not', 'just', '1970s', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'either', 'are', 'sorts', 'weird', 'things', 'going', 'half-insect/half-lizard', 'men', 'known', 'Sleestak', 'are', 'second', 'only', 'Tiki', 'god', 'Trilogy', 'Terror', 'fear', 'meter', 'eerie', 'hisses', 'made', 'heart', 'go', 'flutter', 'are', 'exploding', 'crystals', 'astronauts', 'parachuting', 'sorts', 'interestingly', 'whacky', 'sci-fi', 'stuff.The', 'acting', 'Spencer', 'Milligan', 'Kathy', 'Coleman', 'Wesley', 'Eure', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overstated', 'unique', 'abilities', 'be', 'believable', 'made', 'show', 'believable', 'Were', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'bet', 'bit', 'acting', 'here', 'there', 'Yes', 'BUT', 'was', 'believable', 'family', 'doing', 'best', 'stay', 'sane', 'insane', 'environment.The', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'stars', 'will', 'have', 'holding', 'gut', 'laughing', 'interview', 'now', 'Kathy', 'Coleman', 'Wesley', 'Eure', 'awesome', 'loved', 'working', 'show', 'cherish', 'memories', 'as', 'much', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'series', 'back', 'stories', 'went', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'take', 'certain', 'themes', 'characters', 'utterly', 'priceless.For', 'decades', 'have', 'pined', 'show', 'whenever', ""'ve"", 'run', '30-somethings', 'topic', 'show', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'have', 'always', 'heard', 'comments', 'LOVED', 'SHOW', 'Sleestak', 'scared', 'pee', 'both.The', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'Professional', 'voice', 'talent', 'went', 'masked/make-uped', 'characters', 'linguist', 'UCLA', 'invented', 'Pakuni', 'language', 'make', 'grammatical', 'believable', 'Basketball', 'stars', '70s', 'played', 'Sleestak', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'writers', 'era', 'wrote', 'show', 'including', 'D.C.', 'Fontana', 'Walter', 'Koenig.The', 'commentaries', 'are', 'hoot', 'priceless', 'own', 'estimation', 'love', 'DVD', 'set', 'had', 'gotten', 'VHS', 'version', 'shows', 'quickly', 'replaced', 'when', 'DVD', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'cast', 'only', 'thing', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'would', 'be', 'out-takes', 'home', 'movies', 'period', 'photos', 'cast', 'make', 'up', 'etc', 'Other', 'flawless', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Rhino', 'God', 'bless', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'much', 'joy', 'nostalgia', 'shows', 'have', 'brought', 'home']",N/A

816046,A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B0001XAMLS,William Smith,"[13, 30]","(I'd give this 2.5 stars actually)Lets talk about the good stuff:Menu's and Extra's (5 stars): In a word: wow. When I think of the fat-cats at Paramount skimping on every last Star Trek episode (you remember that show right, the 60's EPIC?), when it comes to extra's it's almost a miracle that Land of the Lost would be littered with interviews and such thoughtful commentaries. Land of the Lost? A 70's kids show...? So, let me get this straight, the billion dollar trekking industry shuts us out but Sid and Marty Kroft deliver the goods? Sounds about right. The interview with Will and Holly is really neat, the old chemistry is still there:) The menu's are equally as interesting. Being modeled after many sets and decorations from the shows, it really does show the effort that was put into the dvd set, way to go Rhino.Sound (4 stars): Seems the most over looked area about this show. You know, normally I'm a 5.1 nut. A Dolby 5.1 addict as it were and yet this show delivers such great melodies and such a thoughful soundtrack I can over look the 'usual' lag in not updating the sound. The 70's mono never was very good but when you have the right composer... who cares? The closing them rocks! I hadn't heard it for nearly 30 years.The Sets (4 stars): Memorable. Seeing these for the first time since I was 6 or 7, it's almost like I personally used to live there. Odd, huh? For what it was it served us and served well, particularly the cave where the Sleestak lived:)Now, Let's talk about the not so good stuff:The Writing (3 stars): Umm... hmmm... I like many of the script 'ideas' let me say that up front and I notice people here at Amazon seem to go by the names of the writers (DC Fontana, etc) to say that the writing was great, though I wouldn't go that far. Scripts are one thing, but dialogue is another. I know, I know, this was a kids show, but there are certain kids shows that have tremendous cross over in this area, sadly Land of the Lost hasn't aged well in this regard, the dialogue is often beyond corny and sometimes just borders ever so slightly on insulting.The (Over) Acting (2 stars): Sadly this is another weak spot. The good thing is, is I can spread the blame all around. None of the cast do anything great with any sort of consistancy, save for Cha-Ka. Enoch is a good character but is an obvious Mr. Spock rip-off.The Dino's and stuff (2 stars): I've listened to some of the commentaries and some interviews about how 'good' all this used to look and ya know, I kind of doubt it. I do NOT doubt that they did what they could in '74 w/TV but there is an unshakable feeling of dread and disconnectedness most times the dinosaurs are introduced. Even as a child I thought the opening looked phony, that I remember. Perhaps, the dino's aren't the problem but the way the people interact with them is the real culprit. Quite frankly they should have built more sets because the over use of blue screen is very difficult to overlook, especially now. The episode 'Down Stream' is almost comical in this regard.Closing:Rhino really did more than most companies with the extras and the 3 disc packaging is handsome to boot. My only real concern with this as a purchase is a gut feeling I'll probably watch them all once and then shelve it for years to come. Will I buy the next season? Unless I heard that season 2 was dramatically better in terms of quality and re-watchablilty, I doubt it. Still, having said this... this is still a fair buy, if for nothing else, then a history lesson on growing up. Although, if you've taken a gamble on other boxsets like I have (Planet of the Apes TV Series) and have come away with a slam dunk, I see Land of the Lost more like a lay-up... for some reason it goes in but just barely.",2,Not as enthusiastic...,1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,3752,"[""'d"", 'give', '2.5', 'stars', 'actually', 'talk', 'good', 'stuff', 'Menu', 'Extra', '5', 'stars', 'word', 'wow', 'When', 'think', 'fat-cats', 'Paramount', 'skimping', 'last', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'remember', 'show', 'right', '60', 'EPIC', 'when', 'extra', 'almost', 'miracle', 'Land', 'Lost', 'would', 'be', 'littered', 'interviews', 'such', 'thoughtful', 'commentaries', 'Land', 'Lost', '70', 'kids', 'show', 'So', 'let', 'get', 'straight', 'billion', 'dollar', 'trekking', 'industry', 'shuts', 'out', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Kroft', 'deliver', 'goods', 'right', 'interview', 'Will', 'Holly', 'really', 'neat', 'old', 'chemistry', 'still', 'menu', 'are', 'equally', 'interesting', 'Being', 'modeled', 'many', 'sets', 'decorations', 'shows', 'really', 'show', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'dvd', 'set', 'way', 'go', 'Rhino.Sound', '4', 'stars', 'most', 'looked', 'area', 'show', 'know', 'normally', ""'m"", '5.1', 'nut', 'A', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'addict', 'were', 'yet', 'show', 'such', 'great', 'melodies', 'thoughful', 'soundtrack', 'can', 'look', ""'usual"", 'lag', 'not', 'updating', 'sound', '70', 'mono', 'never', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'when', 'have', 'right', 'composer', 'who', 'closing', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'nearly', '30', 'years.The', 'Sets', '4', 'stars', 'Memorable', 'Seeing', 'first', 'time', 'was', '6', '7', 'almost', 'personally', 'used', 'live', 'there', 'Odd', 'huh', 'what', 'was', 'served', 'served', 'well', 'particularly', 'cave', 'where', 'Sleestak', 'lived', 'Now', 'Let', 'talk', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'stuff', 'Writing', '3', 'stars', 'Umm', 'hmmm', 'like', 'many', 'script', 'let', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'notice', 'people', 'here', 'Amazon', 'seem', 'go', 'names', 'writers', 'DC', 'Fontana', 'etc', 'say', 'writing', 'was', 'great', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'Scripts', 'are', 'one', 'thing', 'dialogue', 'know', 'know', 'was', 'kids', 'show', 'are', 'certain', 'kids', 'have', 'tremendous', 'cross', 'area', 'sadly', 'Land', 'Lost', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'regard', 'dialogue', 'often', 'corny', 'sometimes', 'just', 'borders', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'insulting.The', 'Acting', '2', 'stars', 'Sadly', 'weak', 'spot', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'spread', 'blame', 'around', 'None', 'cast', 'do', 'anything', 'great', 'sort', 'consistancy', 'save', 'Cha-Ka', 'Enoch', 'good', 'character', 'obvious', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'rip-off.The', 'Dino', 'stuff', '2', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'how', ""'good"", 'used', 'look', 'ya', 'know', 'kind', 'doubt', 'do', 'NOT', 'doubt', 'did', 'what', 'could', ""'74"", 'w/TV', 'unshakable', 'feeling', 'dread', 'disconnectedness', 'most', 'times', 'dinosaurs', 'are', 'introduced', 'Even', 'child', 'thought', 'opening', 'looked', 'phony', 'remember', 'Perhaps', 'dino', 'are', ""n't"", 'problem', 'way', 'people', 'interact', 'real', 'culprit', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'should', 'have', 'built', 'more', 'sets', 'over', 'use', 'blue', 'screen', 'very', 'difficult', 'overlook', 'especially', 'now', 'episode', 'Stream', 'almost', 'comical', 'regard.Closing', 'Rhino', 'really', 'did', 'more', 'most', 'companies', 'extras', '3', 'disc', 'packaging', 'handsome', 'boot', 'only', 'real', 'concern', 'purchase', 'gut', 'feeling', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'watch', 'once', 'then', 'shelve', 'years', 'come', 'Will', 'buy', 'next', 'season', 'heard', 'season', '2', 'was', 'dramatically', 'better', 'terms', 'quality', 're-watchablilty', 'doubt', 'Still', 'having', 'said', 'still', 'fair', 'buy', 'nothing', 'else', 'then', 'history', 'lesson', 'growing', 'up', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'gamble', 'other', 'boxsets', 'have', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'TV', 'Series', 'have', 'come', 'away', 'slam', 'dunk', 'see', 'Land', 'Lost', 'more', 'lay-up', 'reason', 'just', 'barely']",N/A
