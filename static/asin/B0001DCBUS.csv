Before I write my review I saw what others said about it in imdb website. It has got 4 out of 10! The reason why I bought this movie was the price. It was inexpensive and I like drama, but this one lacks lots of what real drama is. Some people may have other opinions and I do respect all opinions.",1,Normal old drama,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,421,"['Nothing', 'much', 'really', 'say', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'person', 'judge', 'movie', 'movie', 'so', 'cold', 'not', 'excited', 'write', 'review', 'saw', 'what', 'others', 'said', 'imdb', 'website', 'got', '4', '10', 'reason', 'why', 'bought', 'movie', 'was', 'price', 'was', 'inexpensive', 'like', 'drama', 'one', 'lots', 'what', 'real', 'drama', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'other', 'opinions', 'do', 'respect', 'opinions']",Her Best Friend's Husband

Her best friend (Jane) is visiting and we see sparks between Jane and husband. When husband takes Jane to the airport they kiss - yawn. Husband pursues Jane with letters and phone messages. At the same time Mandy sending Jane (Cheryl Ladd) updates of her life moving on like opening store. Work brings Jane back for a visit - another predictable story line. When visiting Jane also interested in younger man to the annoyance of husband who is pursuing Jane. Doesn't look like a chance for younger man as Jane and husband make love in bed. Another big yawn for suspense. More love making. Mandy thinks Jane is having affair with younger man - not her husband. By accident Mandy's daughter sees her father and Jane kissing and tells her mom. Mandy waiting at husband's place when husband and Jane show up kissing and undressing. Mandy explodes and tells Jane friendship is over for good. Jane asks husband if they are in love...more love making.
