He was so charming and I kept wondering who the actor was.After I watched this, I immediately viewed the movie I had accidentally rented, Red (2008). It's a brutal, sad and touching story that I'll never forget.

And so... Red is just that- a waste of my precious time.  I knew this movie was going to be bad when it started- Bruce is calling a woman at work on the phone and for several minutes they talk nonsense about visiting Chili for vacation and other pointless topics.  That kind of writing is beyond pointless- it doesn't belong in ANY movie, let alone this one.  Well it gets worse, MUCH worse.One night Bruce walks into the kitchen and *in the most melodramatic way imaginable* intruders with guns break in and attempt to take Bruce out.  I just assumed Bruce was imagining this entire incident given the lack of suspense... but no.  He responds by putting bullets in a frying pan and having them explode and shoot across the room in an attempt to trick the crazy gunmen.  I admit I DID like how the men were firing literally hundreds of bullets per second at Bruce's house.  I may dislike the guy in these type of films but I don't necessarily hate him *that* much!The film then reveals what it is- a really pathetic, exaggerated, generic adventure/shooter.  Bruce kidnaps the woman he was chatting on the phone with, or rather, breaks into her home.  The suspense was killed here the moment the woman hesitated to feel frightened over Bruce's presence.  What?  The way the two of them communicate wasn't the least bit funny and perfectly indicated what kind of silliness and low budget writing this was going to be... for the next hour and 30 minutes.

Obviously, the actors had a ton of fun doing this and that is confirmed by the 30 minute extra on behind the scenes. Also, the director is a genius. His dissolves to each location by slapping up a postcard be it of New Orleans or New York City and how the camera zooms in to the location within the postcard is way cool.The extras also rock as there's a great animated CIA conspiracy history, commentary tracks with an ex-CIA operative on there as well as this Red trivia track you can fool around with.FYI, the movie title does not stand for some Communist plot (although Brian Cox plays an ex-KGB agent) but stands for ""Retired Extremely Dangerous.""",5,A+ cast makes this a B movie to watch,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,1389,"['story', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'run-of-the-mill', 'ex-spies', 'run', 'being', 'hunted', 'down', 'what', 'know', 'yep', 'basically', 'Bourne', 'series', 'was', 'latest', 'mine', 'movie', 'far', 'B', 'movie', 'roots', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'best', 'stoic', 'Die', 'Hard', 'character', 'woman', 'Big', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'plausible', 'love', 'interest', 'Throw', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'playing', 'usual', 'loopy', 'self', 'Helen', 'St.', 'Mirren', 'guntoting', 'sniper', 'well', 'have', 'got', 'movie', 'what', 'even', 'gratuitous', 'Mermaid', 'Man', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Spongebob', 'voice', 'work', 'fame', 'threw', 'kids', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'baddie.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'works', 'acting', 'period', 'Obviously', 'actors', 'had', 'ton', 'fun', 'doing', 'confirmed', '30', 'minute', 'extra', 'scenes', 'Also', 'director', 'genius', 'dissolves', 'location', 'slapping', 'up', 'postcard', 'be', 'New', 'Orleans', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'how', 'camera', 'location', 'postcard', 'way', 'cool.The', 'extras', 'also', 'rock', 'great', 'animated', 'CIA', 'conspiracy', 'history', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'ex-CIA', 'operative', 'as', 'well', 'Red', 'trivia', 'track', 'can', 'fool', 'with.FYI', 'movie', 'title', 'not', 'stand', 'Communist', 'plot', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'ex-KGB', 'agent', 'Retired', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous']",Red

It's a light-hearted action film that doesn't take itself too seriously, with comedy and spy thriller elements thrown in, plus a dash of romance for good measure. The actors all look like they had a lot of fun making this film and I certainly had a lot of fun watching it.Bruce Willis is Frank Moses, a former CIA operative, the quintessential bad ass. Now retired and bored, he spends his days chatting with a customer service representative at the regional pension office named Sarah (Parker), until one evening when a wet team is sent to his house to kill him. He quickly dispatches his would-be assassins and races to Kansas City to protect Sarah. Someone has labeled him RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) and Frank sets off to uncover why while evading agent Cooper (Urban), a young CIA operative assigned to kill Frank. What follows is an entertaining old-fashioned spy adventure as Frank seeks out old allies and ""gets the band together again"", including Joe (Freeman), crazy man Marvin (Malkovich), ex-MI6 operative Victoria (Mirren), and Russian secret agent Ivan (Cox).Right from the beginning, I knew I was in for a good time when Frank takes the bullets from his assailants' handgun and cooks them on a frying pan, thus creating a time-delayed diversion. I've never seen that before in a movie. Sure, there's the main story of under-handed dealings and a top-secret government cover-up, but you're really here to see the good guys kick ass! The action comes quick and it comes often, including one ridiculously over-the-top shootout in a loading dock involving a pink stuffed pig and a woman in high-heels and an RPG!The story isn't particularly original, but I was more than happy to go along for the ride. The retired super agents angle has already been done inThe Expendablesand the Frank character is almost the same as his McClane inDie Hard. It's got the requisite elaborate spy-thriller heist stuff that is par for the course, likeMission Impossible Threeand even a twist at the end that's almost required these days-- but if you've been paying attention, this won't come as a surprise. Even with this, it's very hard to hate this film, unless you are a total grinch.The cast consists of some of my favorite actors today and seeing them with guns blazing is a lot of fun. Watching Helen Mirren manning a .50 cal machine gun in a long white evening gown is almost worth the price of admission! Willis is typecast as an action hero and someone you would expect in the role of a tough guy, but the distinguished Dame Mirren is the very face of class and great fun to see outside of her usual roles. The only nit I have to pick is with Cox's bad Russian accent, however, he is still lovable as the hopeless romantic Ivan.Don't think too hard or take this film too seriously, because it certainly doesn't. The film ends happily with a silly moment. I wouldn't mind seeing a RED 2 if the studio decides to make another one.

She's reduced to an animated prop as the director pretty much forgets about her and the potentially interesting relationship between her and Bruce Willis. He dead-pans through the entire movie, so much a star that he feels no need to put in a modicum of effort. Helen Mirren thinks that it's amusing just because she's Helen Mirren holding a gun and Helen Mirren delivering stupid lines and Helen Mirren murdering people like a sociopath.Actually all the characters are sociopathic murderers, and we know how hilarious sociopathic murderers can be. Knee-slapping! I wasn't following the uninteresting story, it was based on a comic book and it shows. Characters show up, like Richard Dreyfus and Brian Cox, and I didn't particularly care who they were and why they were there. None of them were amusing, including John Malkovich.

With RED, you get just that.From the opening scenes of Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) reading romance novels and trying to live a normal life, making excuses to talk to an operator at the Government Pension office, despite never having met her, and into the moment where his house is flooded by black ops, you get exactly what RED is about. Fun and Action.Where most movies these days disappoint or bore, RED doesn't do that. It does exactly what you would expect from a movie that puts Bruce Willis where he's most comfortable.

And it's harder still to tell a story that will not only entertain audiences, but also keep them intrigued. Not only does ""Red"" successfully achieve all three, it also manages to house it within the context of a graphic novel, a notoriously fanboy-exclusive genre. Fanboys will certainly appreciate this film, but so, I believe, will general audiences; apart from being a fun, thrilling comedy caper, it's also a thoroughly absorbing tale of conspiracy, friendship, loyalty, and yes, even romance. It displays a fair share of comic book violence, and yet it never becomes overpowering, so we can simultaneously revel in the stunts and explosions and pay attention to the plot. It's nice to know that even comic adaptations can be made to appeal to everyone and not merely exist in a closed universe.Adapted from the graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, ""Red"" tells the story of four retired CIA agents who have been marked for death. Exactly who wants them dead and why, they don't yet know. It all begins with a former black-ops agent named Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), who, despite his impeccable service record, has been labeled RED - Retired, Extremely Dangerous. Up until a team of assassins entered his home, he had been living the quite life in a secluded suburban area. He had started a phone relationship with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), who tries to manage his pension from a cubicle in Kansas City; it proved to be an unwise move, for now she's also a target for assassination. Frank kidnaps her for her own good. She's initially frightened by him, although it very quickly becomes apparent that she gets off by living dangerously. She's also one of the few people outside of his inner circle that can handle his witty banter.The death of a newspaper reporter leads to the discovery of a long hit list. This, in turn, leads to Frank reuniting with his old teammates: Intelligence specialist Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), who languishes in a New Orleans retirement home; spy and camouflage expert Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), who lives in bomb shelter in Pensacola and, after years of undergoing Russian mind-control experiments, has every reason to be hopelessly paranoid; and Victoria (Helen Mirren), now a domestic Martha Stewart-type in Chesapeake, although she often yearns for her old days as a Wetwork special ops agent, where she was proficient with long range weapons. Together, they work towards uncovering a massive conspiracy, one that connects to an assignment they were a part of years earlier.On their tails is CIA agent William Cooper (Karl Urban), who seems to understand his mission less and less the more he learns about Frank and his team. Far from a villainous clich&eacute;, he's a family man who's dedicated to his job yet does possess the ability to think rationally; he's methodical and cunning, but he's also capable of making mistakes, and the more he realizes what Frank is capable of, the less he's inclined to listen to his superiors and carry out his mission. He also realizes, rather harshly, that both he and Frank have the wherewithal to fight for who they love.The film deftly manages a balancing act between action violence and comedy, helped in no small part by actors who are quite funny. Malkovich is the obvious example, his character a wacky explosion of goofy dialogue and sheer mental instability. But Willis, Freeman, and Mirren shouldn't be forgotten, here; they too reveal a refreshing sense of humor, mostly in relation to how their characters have adapted - or at the very least, have tried to adapt - to retired life. Credit also to Parker, whose surprisingly realistic dialogue is the perfect counterpart to Willis', which is pleasantly silly. Ironically, it's the mildly serious nature of the story that allows the leads to be so funny; had the film been a nonstop joke fest, had there been not a shred of heavy-handedness, the subtle quirkiness of the characters would not have registered. They simply would have disappeared into the background.Fortunately, the filmmakers found a way to keep every aspect of the movie engaging. Nothing is left to the sidelines, not even the occasional stunt sequence, each lasting long enough to be entertaining but not going on so long that they become boring. Perhaps the best extra touch is a small but memorable guest appearance by Ernest Borgnine, who at age ninety-three looks, moves, and sounds like an actor twenty, nay, thirty years his junior. As the film's tagline says, ""Still got it."" Everyone involved with this film has got it. 2010 has seen the release of several comic book/graphic novel adaptations I enjoyed, including ""Iron Man 2,"" ""The Losers,"" and ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" (I'm conveniently forgetting the deplorable ""Kick-Ass""). ""Red"" is by far the best of them all. It's funny, exciting, and absorbing - a thoroughly entertaining film.",4,The CIA's Most Wanted,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,4952,"['hard', 'make', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'even', 'harder', 'make',

The movie stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban, and very funny John Malkovich.  The movie is directed by Robert Schwentke, who previously directed The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan.  The plot of the movie Frank (Bruce Willis) is retired, bored and lonely living off his government pension in a nondescript suburb in an equally nondescript house. The only joy in Frank's life are his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker Sarah (Mary-Louis Parker).  Sarah is as bored and lonely as Frank and marks her conversations with the unknown Frank and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life. When something in Frank's past forces Frank back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting Sarah in the middle of the intrigue, Frank and Sarah begin a journey into Franks past and the people he used to work with.

MacGruber, Machete and now Red have all been absurdly obnoxious, but their cast has kept them in the realm of the best films of 2010.Let's start with THEE action star himself, Bruce Willis. Surprisingly enough, he's not a cop this time! He's Frank Moses, an ex CIA operative being hunted down by a league of bad guys who make Swiss cheese out of his house via machineguns. Naturally Frank walks away unscathed and we are left wondering: who would send so many dudes to shoot up a house rather than just one to blow it up?The answer to that is found in Red's tone, which is: because it looks cooler. The charm of Red is that it knows it's absurd but it wants to be, and it also knows how to be absurd but cleverly entertaining at the same time. Oh, and if you are wondering why it's called Red, well that stands for Retired Extremely Dangerous; see what I mean?Frank has been flirting over the phone with a phone operator named Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) and in doing so does two things an action hero can never do without serious consequences: he speaks on an unsecured line and he falls in love with a beautiful woman whom the bad guys will inevitably capture and hold at bay.This happens of course, but it's not the chain of events that holds our attention, so much as the journey we take with the characters in getting to those must-have action moments. For instance, not having time to explain that more bad guys are about to break down her door and kill her, Frank kidnaps Sarah; and this is their first meet I might add. Then they head off on an amusing road trip in search of assistance and information from a league of Frank's old counterparts who include Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren.Next to the gnarly bad-ass-ness that is Bruce Willis in anything he does - the Malkovich character was my favorite. Malkovich plays Marvin Boggs, a paranoid gun toting hermit who lives in a kind of underground fall out shelter, accessed only by - well, I can't reveal that; it's too funny and I've said too much already. Just know that you will love Malkovich's off the wall and canny portrayal, and that he gets 90 percent of the laughs.

At this, the film excels spectacularly.  It concerns the retired (extremely dangerous) CIA agent Frank Moses, who one night finds a hit squad in his house.  Determined to track down who's behind the attempted hit, Moses rounds up some old friends, and together they decide to take on the CIA and potentially the entire US government.  Sound like a good time?  You bet it is!Without the spectacular cast (all of whom are delightfully hamming it up), the film would still be enjoyable.  With this cast, it borders on one of the best action comedies of recent years.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich are all top-notch as retired agents with a little bite left in them.  Joining them for the ride is a delightfully cool and sinister Karl Urban, as the man pursuing Moses; Marie-Louise Parker, charming and hilarious, as Moses's love interest; Brian Cox as a former Russian spy; Ernest Borgnine as a records keeper; and Richard Dreyfus as a shady businessman.The characters are two dimensional, and the plot is shallow and convoluted.  Various plot holes aren't resolved, and the trailers gave away a lot of great moments plot details (though don't worry, there are still plenty of others).  These may seem like minor things in an action movie, but in a film with this great a cast, you notice them.  That's the only reason RED gets 4 instead of 5 stars.

I saw the previews and thought that it had potential, but I was weary because the reviews were so scattered in their opinions of it. I was still hopeful though, mainly because it had Bruce Willis (always good for a fun show), Morgan Freeman (awesome actor), Helen Mirren (excellent actress in cool roles), and Karl Urban (rising in stardom). Sorry, John Malkovich wasn't in that list because I was never really fond of him, but he did add a lot of comedy to this film. He did a great job in this role.The story is about a group of retired CIA operatives who are suddenly thrown back into the action when they are strangely placed on the RED (retired, extremely dangerous) list and become targets for the police force.Now, don't expect a lot of content when you watch the film. It is, above all else, an action film. It's kinda likeOcean's ElevenmeetsLive Free or Die Hard. It's got lots of guns, explosions, and ridiculous action. And lots of comedy. Lots and lots of comedy. But it is a man movie, so just enjoy the ride and don't think too hard.I have to admit, I think my favorite part of the film was Mary-Louise Parker. She plays Willis' love interest in the film and she is hilarious. I think she really holds this movie together, aside from the action of course. Oh, and Helen Mirren blowing people away with a gun is pretty-dang funny too.So, an enjoyable film with lots of comic surprises if you're in the mood for a good comedy-action flick.As far as questionable content:Violence. More violence. Lots of violence. (It is an action film after all.) Some extreme cases of violence include a guy getting blown apart by a grenade - not gore, but borderline. There is some profanity as well.

I stumbled across RED recently while channel surfing, and before I knew it, I was watching intently, a fixed grin on my mug.  When a group of former CIA ops reunites to take on a federal government bent on taking them out for knowing too much, with the Vice President himself (Julian McMahon) and an international weapons dealer (Richard Dreyfuss) pulling the strings, you've got a recipe for shoot-'em-up fun.  And the group of senior former spies?  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren (with a dazzling Mary-Louise Parker thrown in as love interest for Willis's character).  To watch this ensemble go to work--especially Mirren packing a machine gun--you can't help but love it, and have grand fun watching.Yet RED is more than violence and action-packed thrills; this movie has a razor sharp, never-ending comedic edge.  To watch Malkovich muck it up with an array of unreal weapons is sheer bliss; and the character actor Brian Cox adds his own brand of humor to the mix playing a former KGB adversary who is madly in love with the Mirren character.  The cast just meshes, and you can tell they had as much fun making RED as the viewer has watching RED.  It comes as no surprise this film spawned a sequel currently making the theatrical rounds; if one can have this much fun watching a group of seniors take no prisoners, then the sky's the limit when it comes to keeping the action coming as the RED franchise rolls merrily along.--D.

I couldn't resist adding my superlatives to the long list of positive reviews, especially since I have watched this DVD recently for the third time.  Even the extra features are interesting!All the main players are in top form and their obvious chemistry adds so much to the generally upbeat mood.  They are having a ball and not taking themselves too seriously, while poking fun at a series of events which are both topical and credible.  We learn from the extras that an ex-CIA agent oversaw the production and it shows!The story begins with a look at the life of early retiree Frank Moses (Bruce Willis at his sardonic best), and it is immediately clear that this freakishly neat, mild-mannered man has secret depths.  He calls to complain about his pension payment being late, but this is a blatant excuse to chat up his caseworker (competently portrayed by Mary-Louise Parker).  It becomes clear that, despite their age difference, they have both been enjoying these conversations for some time and soon, with some misgivings, she agrees to meet Frank in real life.From here on, the action takes off as Frank's past catches up with him and, facing mortal danger, he is forced to re-assemble a team of his former associates.John Malkovich gives an unforgettable performance as a mentally-damaged but still sharp former CIA operative (&#8220;I'm getting the PIG&#8221;); Helen Mirren is equally fantastic as the gun-toting ex-spy who is unable to make a complete transition to her new life as the suave hostess of a luxury guest house (&#8220;I take the odd contract on the side. I just can't stop.&#8221;).  Brian Cox is priceless in the role of a love-sick Russian agent and manages to steal many scenes (&#8220;But you didn't come just for the vodka&#8221;).  Morgan Freeman is both touching and hilarious and Karl Urban deals expertly with his conflicted character.  Ernest Borgnine brings a life-weary, seen-it-all, deep humanity in a superb cameo appearance.  I could go on, as there isn't a weak performance in this whole movie and the stunts and special effects are nothing less than spectacular.The movie moves along at a lively pace and there are surprises right up to the end.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[8, 8]","""Red"" (Retired Extremely Dangerous) is an action/adventure/comedy about four former CIA operatives who have never quite lost their addiction to adrenaline.  During the opening credits, we observe a bored-looking Bruce Willis, who plays tough-as-nails Frank Moses, eating breakfast, working out, checking his mail, and chatting with a woman over the phone named Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) whom he would like to get to know better.  It is Christmas season and every house is festively decorated.  Suddenly, all heck breaks loose as a team of assassins closes in on Moses's house with enough firepower to destroy a city block.  Who is targeting Frank and why?Eventually, Moses teams up with his old buddies, Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich), and the still sexy Victoria (Helen Mirren), all of whom are highly-trained former operatives with an encyclopedic knowledge of firearms and explosives.  Since Frank has shown an interest in Sarah, she is dragged into the mess.  They criss-cross the country trying to elude their pursuers and find out who is behind all of the mayhem.This kind of satirical movie is extremely difficult to pull off.  Director Robert Schwentke tries not to wink at the audience too much, and the old pros play their parts amusingly, only occasionally going too far over the top.  The script by Jon and Erich Hoeber, based on a graphic novel, is insubstantial, and there are quite a few scenes of cartoonish violence.  Since the screenplay is not exactly Shakespearean in scope, you will need to put your brain on hold.  So, why should you see this film?  If you have a free afternoon or evening and do not mind a bit of escapism, ""Red"" is an enjoyable diversion.  Willis and his colleagues seem to be having a great time playing off one another and poking fun at the kind of character whom Bruce Willis portrayed so well during his salad days.",4,"""I do take the odd contract on the side.""",1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,1881,"['Red', 'Retired', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'action/adventure/comedy', 'four', 'former', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'quite', 'lost', 'addiction', 'adrenaline', 'opening', 'credits', 'observe', 'bored-looking', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'tough-as-nails', 'Frank', 'Moses', 'eating', 'breakfast', 'working', 'out', 'checking', 'mail', 'chatting', 'woman', 'phone', 'named', 'Sarah', 'Ross', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'whom', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'Christmas', 'season', 'house', 'festively', 'decorated', 'Suddenly', 'heck', 'breaks', 'loose', 'team', 'assassins', 'closes', 'Moses', 'house', 'enough', 'firepower', 'destroy', 'city', 'block', 'Who', 'targeting', 'Frank', 'why', 'Eventually', 'Moses', 'teams', 'up', 'old', 'buddies', 'Joe', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Marvin', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'still', 'sexy', 'Victoria', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'whom', 'are', 'highly-trained', 'former', 'operatives', 'encyclopedic', 'knowledge', 'firearms', 'explosives', 'Frank', 'shown', 'interest', 'Sarah', 'dragged', 'mess', 'criss-cross', 'country', 'trying', 'elude', 'pursuers', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'mayhem.This', 'kind', 'satirical', 'movie', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'pull', 'off', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Schwentke', 'not', 'wink', 'audience', 'too', 'much', 'old', 'pros', 'play', 'parts', 'amusingly', 'only', 'occasionally', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'top', 'script', 'Jon', 'Erich', 'Hoeber', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'insubstantial', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'scenes', 'cartoonish', 'violence', 'screenplay', 'not', 'exactly', 'Shakespearean', 'scope', 'will', 'need', 'put', 'brain', 'hold', 'So', 'why', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'have', 'free', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'bit', 'escapism', 'Red', 'enjoyable', 'diversion', 'Willis', 'colleagues', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'playing', 'off', 'one', 'poking', 'fun', 'kind', 'character', 'whom', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'portrayed', 'so', 'well', 'salad', 'days']",Red

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 4]","RED (2010) is one of those movies that an old cripple awaits with baited breath, because of the cast, the storyline and not the hype. I say that because the film did not live up to the hype. It was a surprise, like being hit just when you thought you'd be safe and off the grid.The great Bruce Willis is as sweet-yet-tough as ever as retired CIA assassin Francis Moses, USMC. After a ""wet team"" (Hollywierdese for ""assassin team"") goes for him and fails, he runs to the phone operator at his pension department and kidnaps her. Why he does this is impossible to say ... but it is the most unique first date I've ever witnessed.He then visits his old friends one by one: Morgan Freeman, in better shape than I thought he'd be, but still looking somewhat broken from his car wreck. I was thrilled to see him as good as ever also. John Malkovich is the LSD-tested goof straight out of ""A Team"", Brian Cox the Great is the goofy old Russian agent, and Martha Stewart-like Helen Mirren rounds out this team. On Willis' tail is Karl Urban, an earlier version of himself ordered to bring him in dead.Throw in a pointless cameo by Richard Dreyfus and you have one of the funniest yet silliest wastes of film in history - yet it is so fun I just went with it. It's tough to do that without the right stars, and I love them all, so I gulped it down with my eyes and ears, laughed myself hoarse, but I was still angry. Too much comic book zeitgeist and frankly, I'm so sick of that I could vomit right here and now.This film does not know what it wants to do, always the director's fault, so it is a spy thriller one minute and a ridiculous rip-off of the 1970s garbage the next minute. Too many bullets and too many laughs do not necessarily a comedy make. That's the worst part: this did not strike me as a comedy judging from the trailers. I frankly expected much better than this, a subtle humor you might expect from retired old assassins getting the band back together again.Instead, it is fairly juvenile, with a few self-deprecating touches in homage to Willis' former films. Funny how they didn't do that with the others, though Helen Mirren does a bit right out of THE QUEEN - I leave that for you to discover. You'll also have to make up your mind whether this is brilliant (most of the comedy truly is) or whether it's end-of-year silly season.I think it is the latter, but my goodness, I loved it anyway. Helen Mirren is the one element you'd never expect to be such a professional kick-ass, and Karl Urban is great as the up-and-coming ""future Bruce Willis"" CIA agent.Irrespective of that, I wouldn't add this to my collection - but maybe I'll like it better after further viewings.",3,"""I remember the Secret Service being a lot tougher.""",1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,2685,"['RED', '2010', 'one', 'movies', 'old', 'cripple', 'baited', 'breath', 'cast', 'storyline', 'not', 'hype', 'say', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'was', 'surprise', 'being', 'hit', 'just', 'when', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'safe', 'grid.The', 'great', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'as', 'sweet-yet-tough', 'ever', 'retired', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'Francis', 'Moses', 'USMC', 'wet', 'team', 'Hollywierdese', 'assassin', 'team', 'fails', 'phone', 'operator', 'pension', 'department', 'kidnaps', 'Why', 'impossible', 'say', 'most', 'unique', 'first', 'date', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed.He', 'then', 'old', 'friends', 'one', 'one', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'better', 'shape', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'still', 'looking', 'somewhat', 'broken', 'car', 'wreck', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'also', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'LSD-tested', 'goof', 'straight', 'Team', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Great', 'goofy', 'old', 'Russian', 'agent', 'Martha', 'Stewart-like', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'out', 'team', 'Willis', 'tail', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'earlier', 'version', 'ordered', 'bring', 'dead.Throw', 'pointless', 'cameo', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'have', 'one', 'funniest', 'yet', 'silliest', 'wastes', 'film', 'history', 'so', 'fun', 'just', 'went', 'tough', 'do', 'right', 'stars', 'love', 'gulped', 'down', 'eyes', 'ears', 'laughed', 'hoarse', 'was', 'still', 'angry', 'Too', 'much', 'comic', 'book', 'zeitgeist', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'so', 'sick', 'could', 'vomit', 'right', 'here', 'now.This', 'film', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'always', 'director', 'fault', 'spy', 'thriller', 'one', 'minute', 'ridiculous', 'rip-off', '1970s', 'garbage', 'next', 'minute', 'Too', 'many', 'bullets', 'too', 'many', 'laughs', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'comedy', 'make', 'worst', 'part', 'did', 'not', 'strike', 'comedy', 'judging', 'trailers', 'frankly', 'expected', 'much', 'better', 'subtle', 'humor', 'might', 'expect', 'retired', 'old', 'assassins', 'getting', 'band', 'back', 'together', 'again.Instead', 'fairly', 'juvenile', 'few', 'self-deprecating', 'touches', 'homage', 'Willis', 'former', 'films', 'Funny', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'others', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'bit', 'right', 'THE', 'QUEEN', 'leave', 'discover', ""'ll"", 'also', 'have', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'brilliant', 'most', 'comedy', 'truly', 'end-of-year', 'silly', 'season.I', 'think', 'latter', 'goodness', 'loved', 'anyway', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'one', 'element', ""'d"", 'never', 'expect', 'be', 'such', 'professional', 'kick-ass', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'great', 'up-and-coming', 'future', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'CIA', 'agent.Irrespective', 'would', ""n't"", 'add', 'collection', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'like', 'better', 'further', 'viewings']",Red

RED stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous and that is borne out as you watch the action unfurl in this deliciously dark and funny comedy.Frank, played by Bruce Willis, doesn't really like retirement all that much.  It's kinda boring after the life he'd led while working for the CIA.  The only thing he really enjoys is talking to his case worker at the Social Security office who takes care of his 'missing' social security checks which he has conveniently torn up so that he has a reason to call her.  They connect in a way he's never connected with women in a face to face situation and so they flirt and tease, giving Frank something to cling to.And then something really strange happens one night.  A wet work team all in black shows up and shoots up his house with Frank in it.  Realizing that something's up, he hits the road to find out why someone is coming after him now that he's living a life of retired obscurity and has to kidnap his Social Security crush because she's in danger, too.He starts looking up his old buddies from the old days, also retired now into quiet obscurity, but retired doesn't mean dead and they are all soon working together to figure out what happened to put Frank on the hot list with a bullet and then to put a stop to the plot behind the plot.And all the while this is going on, the girl who had been harboring her own crush on Frank and looked forward to his calls to complain about another missing check finds herself having a fantastic adventure that beats anything in the pulp romance novels that she shared with Frank.This was a truly fun and funny film with a great deal of plot twists and action to satisfy every movie tastebud in the family.And, quite frankly, any movie where Richard Dreyfus is the bad guy has something going for it!Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich round out this cast and it is Malkovich's portrayal of a slightly off the rails former agent who lives off grid and underground that adds the most hilarity to the movie.When the going gets tough, the tough get the pig!",5,""" I'm gettin' the pig!""",1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,2203,"['have', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'fantastically', 'good', 'time', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'RED', 'stands', 'Retired', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'borne', 'out', 'watch', 'action', 'unfurl', 'deliciously', 'dark', 'funny', 'comedy.Frank', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'retirement', 'much', 'kinda', 'boring', 'life', ""'d"", 'led', 'working', 'CIA', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'talking', 'case', 'worker', 'Social', 'Security', 'office', 'who', 'care', ""'missing"", 'social', 'security', 'checks', 'conveniently', 'torn', 'up', 'so', 'reason', 'call', 'connect', 'way', 'never', 'connected', 'women', 'face', 'face', 'situation', 'so', 'flirt', 'tease', 'giving', 'Frank', 'something', 'cling', 'to.And', 'then', 'something', 'really', 'strange', 'one', 'night', 'wet', 'work', 'team', 'black', 'shows', 'up', 'shoots', 'up', 'house', 'Frank', 'Realizing', 'something', 'up', 'road', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'someone', 'coming', 'now', 'living', 'life', 'retired', 'obscurity', 'kidnap', 'Social', 'Security', 'crush', 'danger', 'too.He', 'starts', 'looking', 'up', 'old', 'buddies', 'old', 'days', 'also', 'retired', 'now', 'quiet', 'obscurity', 'retired', ""n't"", 'mean', 'dead', 'are', 'soon', 'working', 'together', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'put', 'Frank', 'hot', 'list', 'bullet', 'then', 'put', 'stop', 'plot', 'plot.And', 'while', 'going', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'harboring', 'own', 'crush', 'Frank', 'looked', 'forward', 'calls', 'complain', 'missing', 'check', 'having', 'fantastic', 'adventure', 'anything', 'pulp', 'romance', 'novels', 'shared', 'Frank.This', 'was', 'truly', 'fun', 'funny', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'plot', 'twists', 'action', 'satisfy', 'movie', 'tastebud', 'family.And', 'quite', 'frankly', 'movie', 'where', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'bad', 'guy', 'something', 'going', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'Malkovich', 'portrayal', 'slightly', 'rails', 'former', 'agent', 'who', 'grid', 'underground', 'most', 'hilarity', 'movie.When', 'going', 'tough', 'tough', 'get', 'pig']",Red

Willard,"[2, 4]","First and foremost, do NOT pay any attention to the 1 star reviews that are complaining that they couldn't take the time to check the difference between the reg. edition and the special edition so they were upset that the basic version was in Dolby sound and not HD. They aren't rating the movie at all. They are only rating it 1 star based off their own frustrations.On to the movie:Extras:This is a fun to watch, a bit over the top but fun to watch film. In the behind the scenes they talk about how everyone brought their A-game and it made the others step up and be competative which made for a fun movie to make. You can see the sincerity in their interviews that even the top stars were enjoying working with the other stars in the film. At first, you may say, ""There are very few special features. Why is this a special edition?"" Well, the special edition has better audio/sound and I guess that's it but in the extras menu, it has only 3-4 extras but once you go into these options, it opens up many more short behind the scenes, interviews and much more. It looks like very little extras but there's more there than it looks like.Movie:By ""over the top"" I meant that anyone with any military or spec ops experience will say, ""Um...you can't do that"" at a few points but it's a movie and don't look too much into the somewhat exhagerated parts and you'll really enjoy this movie. One example is, you can NOT continually fire a 50cal machinegun without letting go of the trigger. You have to fire in 3-4 round bursts or you'll melt the barrel and it will seize up or worse. Small stuff like this might annoy some people but just watch it and enjoy.There are a lot of great one-liners and Malkovich (Martin) gets some of the best lines. Although Bruce Willis (ex-CIA) can be called the star, Morgan Freeman (ex-CIA), John Malkovich (ex-CIA), Helen Mirren (ex-MI6), Brian Cox (ex-KGB?), Karl Urban (CIA) and many more are all written so well that they all steal scenes at one point or another.Karl Urban is the younger CIA agent that is on the trail of the retired (RED) operatives and as the movie progresses, I found it very well written that even though he is slowly learning that maybe these guys aren't the bad guys, he does his job no matter what.

1357878,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B003Q6D2B4,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[2, 3]","What's the selling point of RED? Stars you like doing stuff you like, mainly shooting things. At this, the film does very well. And fortunately, the things it doesn't do very well don't detract from the film that much.Granted, the plot is incomprehensible, and the supposed twists at the end will have you thoroughly scratching your head, but most of the main plot points at least have an interesting action setpiece surrounding it. Also, I had a big problem with Morgan Freeman in this film, as he gets second billing, but is in the film a grand total of 10 minutes. He's good during those 10 minutes, but it's little more than a glorified extended cameo, since he doesn't really factor into much of anything very much. I mean, was he too busy filming Thick as Thieves or any of the other myriad straight-to-dvd trash he's been involved with in the past decade? Sorry, just had to get those off my chest.Still, RED mostly makes it up with a great cast and creative action. It's hard to tell what Bruce Willis phoning in a performance is anymore, but here he's just Bruce Willis, and the results are pretty nice. He's still believable as an elite assassin type who can best men half his age, and he pulls the romantic aspects of the plot fine as well. Which brings me to Mary-Louise Parker who while I've never been a particular fan of, does a good job as the cute government customer service girl dragged into this crazy conspiracy. She's charming and funny, and while she isn't exactly asked to do a lot, she does a very good job with what she has. Helen Mirren and Brian Cox are appropriately cute together. Karl Urban sounds exactly like Dr. McCoy as a CIA agent, but he's actually quite likable despite some of the more cliched aspects of his character.Still, none of them quite reach the level of John Malkovich having a helluva good time as the LSD-dosed paranoid agent who serves about 85% of the comedic beats of this action comedy. He really gives a lot to the role, giving the appropriate amount of crazy to make this character, who at one point charges at the Vice-President with a fake bomb strapped to him, really funny and memorable. He has a lot of great lines, he has some good action beats, and he's given a lot of great stuff to play off of, mainly his pink pig.As for the action, it has a lot of creative over-the-top sequences, never too far apart, to keep you thoroughly entertained throughout. There's the awesome Bruce Willis stepping out of a moving/spinning car while shooting a guy scene, but the scene taking place with a bunch of cargo crates probably takes the cake. It's fairly short, but it exemplifies everything to like about the movie. There's general craziness (using a gun as a bat to toss back a live grenade), very creative and satisfying moments (the grenade launcher hitting the first guy was particularly great), and then of course you have the explosions and a good Malkovich one-liner to top everything off.Overall, if you know what to expect, and it's really not that hard to know, you should have a pretty enjoyable time watching a bunch of older actors kick butt. It's pretty accessible to most anybody if you want a good date movie, action movie or comedy, and judging by the reaction in my theater audience, it's also quite the crowd-pleaser. So, if you want a bunch of Retired, but Extremely Dangerous people to invade your screen for a good time, put in RED.",4,The Pink Pig Steals The Show,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,3409,"['What', 'selling', 'point', 'RED', 'Stars', 'doing', 'stuff', 'mainly', 'shooting', 'things', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'fortunately', 'things', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'film', 'much.Granted', 'plot', 'incomprehensible', 'supposed', 'twists', 'end', 'will', 'have', 'thoroughly', 'scratching', 'head', 'most', 'main', 'plot', 'points', 'least', 'have', 'interesting', 'action', 'setpiece', 'surrounding', 'Also', 'had', 'big', 'problem', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'film', 'second', 'billing', 'film', 'grand', 'total', '10', 'minutes', 'good', '10', 'minutes', 'little', 'more', 'glorified', 'extended', 'cameo', ""n't"", 'really', 'factor', 'much', 'anything', 'very', 'much', 'mean', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'filming', 'Thick', 'Thieves', 'other', 'myriad', 'straight-to-dvd', 'trash', 'been', 'involved', 'past', 'decade', 'Sorry', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'chest.Still', 'RED', 'mostly', 'up', 'great', 'cast', 'creative', 'action', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'phoning', 'performance', 'anymore', 'here', 'just', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'results', 'are', 'pretty', 'nice', 'still', 'believable', 'elite', 'assassin', 'type', 'who', 'can', 'best', 'men', 'age', 'romantic', 'aspects', 'plot', 'fine', 'well', 'Which', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'particular', 'fan', 'good', 'job', 'cute', 'government', 'customer', 'service', 'girl', 'dragged', 'crazy', 'conspiracy', 'charming', 'funny', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'asked', 'do', 'lot', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'are', 'appropriately', 'cute', 'together', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'exactly', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'CIA', 'agent', 'actually', 'quite', 'likable', 'more', 'cliched', 'aspects', 'character.Still', 'none', 'quite', 'reach', 'level', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'having', 'helluva', 'good', 'time', 'LSD-dosed', 'paranoid', 'agent', 'who', 'about', '85', '%', 'comedic', 'beats', 'action', 'comedy', 'really', 'lot', 'role', 'giving', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'crazy', 'make', 'character', 'who', 'one', 'point', 'charges', 'Vice-President', 'fake', 'bomb', 'strapped', 'really', 'funny', 'memorable', 'lot', 'great', 'lines', 'good', 'action', 'beats', 'given', 'lot', 'great', 'stuff', 'play', 'off', 'mainly', 'pink', 'pig.As', 'action', 'lot', 'creative', 'over-the-top', 'sequences', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'apart', 'keep', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'awesome', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'stepping', 'moving/spinning', 'car', 'shooting', 'guy', 'scene', 'scene', 'taking', 'place', 'bunch', 'cargo', 'crates', 'probably', 'cake', 'fairly', 'short', 'everything', 'like', 'movie', 'general', 'craziness', 'using', 'gun', 'bat', 'toss', 'back', 'live', 'grenade', 'very', 'creative', 'satisfying', 'moments', 'grenade', 'launcher', 'hitting', 'first', 'guy', 'was', 'particularly', 'great', 'then', 'course', 'have', 'explosions', 'good', 'Malkovich', 'one-liner', 'top', 'everything', 'off.Overall', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'really', 'not', 'that', 'know', 'should', 'have', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'watching', 'bunch', 'older', 'actors', 'kick', 'butt', 'pretty', 'accessible', 'most', 'anybody', 'want', 'good', 'date', 'movie', 'action', 'movie', 'comedy', 'judging', 'reaction', 'theater', 'audience', 'also', 'quite', 'crowd-pleaser', 'So', 'want', 'bunch', 'Retired', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'people', 'invade', 'screen', 'good', 'time', 'put', 'RED']",Red

1357888,AY12DBB0U420B,B003Q6D2B4,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's DVD was ""RED"" starring Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman. I found it in the  five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Well, this one has to be one of the weirdest movies I've seen in decades. It's actually hard to explain.You have to see it to believe it. The movie is very funny, but it's largely done in a straight-faced style as an action movie and concerns a group of about a half-dozen retired CIA agents. In fact, the RED stands for ""Retired, Extremely Dangerous."" Okay, so these retired agents are having problems turning off their agentry. They're having trouble adjusting to normal life, to say the least. They still enjoy breaking heads, killing people in creative ways and riddling the landscape with machine-gun fire. Have you ever seen a house completely destroyed by machine-gun fire? Well, here's your chance. It's absurd, of course, but no more absurd than lots of stuff you see in action movies.Some of the scenes are such that I haven't laughed so hard in years. Take one scene, for example. A woman agent fires a grenade rifle at a guy who has a gun. He sees the projectile coming and fires his own conventional gun to stop it. Well, the ultra-slow-motion photography picks up the grenade projectile and the bullet heading toward one another at supersonic speed, making a precise nose-to-nose impact and causing a humongous explosion. This one will leave you wondering how did they ever do it, but you'll be crying with laughter while you're thinking about it. All sorts of other stunts fill the movie. It's a frolicking good time. Trust me.Do you have any questions about CIA activities? Well, this movie will flush them out into the open. I'm sure we all have strange ideas about ultra secret organizations such as the CIA and this movie preys on our anxieties. It's funny, but I'd sure like to know what a real CIA Agent thought of the movie. In this regard, there's an interesting extra feature attached to the movie and I'd suggest you watch it. It's an outstanding movie. The whole cast does an excellent acting job. It's well filmed. The stunts are magnificent. The story is far fetched, but, hey, this is a fine comedy so relax and enjoy.Gary Peterson",5,It's A Frolicking Good Movie.

The story is adapted from the graphic novel by Cully Hamner and Warren Ellis by screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber and directed with great style by Robert Schwentke.  But has been said often, it is the brilliant cast of experienced actors that makes this film one to treasure as simply splendid entertainment.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is bored in his retirement; his only point of interest is a recurrent telephone conversation regarding his pension check with an equally bored government worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louis Parker in a role that finally gives the range of her comedic talent its due!).  Their conversations are overheard by the CIA - William Cooper (Karl Urban) and his boss Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon) - and Frank is marked for assassination. Bu told frank is wily and outsmarts and out shoots his intruders, escapes to take Sarah away from her boring desk job and a caper begins.  It seems there is a plot to uncover the USA Vice President's involvement in a Guatemala coups and Frank seeks out his old confreres - Joe (Morgan Freeman, living in a nursing home but very alert and involved with CIA thinking patterns), Marvin (John Malkovich, a half crazy near delusional but very fine marksman living in an underground hideaway), and Victoria (Helen Mirren, living the elegant life of teas and social activities while privately still taking contract jobs to knock off bad people).  At first Sarah is perplexed by the 'abduction' on the part of Frank, but soon becomes an involved participant in the drive to expose the secret of the Vice President.  The group engages a retired Russian spy (Brian Cox) who just happens to be Victoria's old boyfriend, and together these REDs use their skills, and brains, and great humor to achieve their goal. It is the old REDs against the young CIA agents that provides the tug of war that makes the film soar.The cast sparkles in this richly colorful movie brimming over with CGI effects and impossible situations.  This is not a deep film but a movie that will entertain form the first frame to the final rather surprising episode.  It is a pleasure to simply watch the talents of Willis/Mirren/Freeman/Malkovich/Parker/Cox interact like so many pieces of a fine Swiss watch: they obviously love what they are asked to do!

Frank Moses is a retired CIA wet works operative trying to fit a normal, if lonely, life in the 'burbs. But when Frank reaches out to a bored federal pension service representative named Sarah, when he tries to step out of his hermit's existence, somewhere in the paranoid bowels of the CIA, a red flag goes up. One dark night a CIA-sanctioned hit squad invades Frank's home. Frank Moses's top secret personal dossier is stamped ""RED"" - for ""Retired, Extremely Dangerous."" They should've brought more hit squads.And now Frank Moses is all sorts of curious as to why a kill team was deployed against him. Off he goes looking for answers, low profile all shot to pieces.If you've read Warren Ellis's repressively bleak, gritty comic book RED, this movie adaptation'll surprise you some. With an eye towards a more audience-friendly product, the screenplay expands on and switches it up some from the original source. Three things stand out immediately and notably. The tone is more lighthearted, tongue-in-cheeky, and not as violent. Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker, really good) - who this time isn't Moses's case handler - achieves more camera time. And, unlike in the comic book in which he's strictly a lone wolf, Moses has a team to assemble. Or as Morgan Freeman's 80-year-old, liver-cancered rest home retiree remarks: ""Well, we're getting the band back together. That's nice."" And maybe you can't teach old dogs new tricks. But these old dogs have perfected what tricks they do have. Today's CIA asshats have a job and a half trying to curb these - to steal a phrase from Holly Golightly - ""mean REDs.""The absolutely top notch cast is what makes this film so much fun to watch. It's worth the price of admission just to see terrific old pros like Willis, Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren at play. These actors create a marvelous synergy. They even sort of channel that old Rat Pack cool. Bruce Willis still has the chops to pull of that action leading man role. And, to quote Warren Ellis: ""Who wouldn't want to see Helen Mirren with a sniper rifle?"" One of the most amusing tidbits divulged in the special features is that Mirren patterned her assassin character after the immaculate Martha Stewart. Karl Urban, fresh off knocking everyone's socks off as the re-imagined Dr. McCoy in STAR TREK, makes a credible - and even likable - antagonist. More old far+s get dusted off for cameos, such as Ernest Borgnine as the CIA's venerable records keeper and Richard Dreyfuss as a sleazy CEO of a defense contract company.RED, with its brisk cross-country jaunts and its root-for-the-badasss-geriatrics theme and its consistently entertaining beats, is also just off-kiltered enough to make it seem fresh. There's this light capery touch which graces even the film's most generic shoot-'em-up sequences. Given the caliber of the cast, RED would've had to work overtime to stink up the joint. As it is, it certainly made enough of a killing at the box office that a sequel is in the works.Of course, it's no Love's Savage Secret.The Special Edition DVD's bonus features: audio commentary by retired CIA Field Officer and RED consultant Robert Baer who gives revealing insights regarding the film's plausibility (and implausibility); 10 Deleted & Extended Scenes, including a funny scene which supplements the film's closing moments of Frank and Marvin on a mission in Moldova (00:08:49 minutes long); an optional running RED trivia track in text captions throughout the film: ""Cast Insights"" - 14 segments covering topics such as set and location shoots, action sequences, the awesomeness of the cast, and even Helen Mirren's Georgio Armani purse (totaling 00:29:15 minutes); and ""CIA Exposed"" - disclosing past, previously secret CIA operations, including one project which focused on experimentation with cats (totaling 00:05:59 minutes).",5,"""You just had your a** handed to you by a goddamn retiree.""",1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,3905,"['Should', ""n't"", 'stir', 'up', 'hornet', 'nest', 'just', 'asking', 'Frank', 'Moses', 'retired', 'CIA', 'wet', 'operative', 'trying', 'fit', 'normal', 'lonely', 'life', ""'burbs"", 'when', 'Frank', 'out', 'bored', 'federal', 'pension', 'service', 'representative', 'named', 'Sarah', 'when', 'step', 'out', 'hermit', 'existence', 'somewhere', 'paranoid', 'bowels', 'CIA', 'red', 'flag', 'up', 'One', 'dark', 'night', 'CIA-sanctioned', 'hit', 'squad', 'Frank', 'home', 'Frank', 'Moses', 'top', 'secret', 'personal', 'dossier', 'stamped', 'RED', 'Retired', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'should', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'more', 'hit', 'squads.And', 'now', 'Frank', 'Moses', 'sorts', 'curious', 'why', 'kill', 'team', 'was', 'deployed', 'looking', 'answers', 'low', 'shot', 'pieces.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Warren', 'Ellis', 'repressively', 'bleak', 'gritty', 'comic', 'book', 'RED', 'movie', 'adaptation', ""'ll"", 'surprise', 'eye', 'more', 'audience-friendly', 'product', 'screenplay', 'switches', 'up', 'original', 'source', 'Three', 'things', 'stand', 'out', 'immediately', 'notably', 'tone', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'tongue-in-cheeky', 'not', 'violent', 'Sarah', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'really', 'good', 'who', 'time', ""n't"", 'Moses', 'case', 'handler', 'more', 'camera', 'time', 'comic', 'book', 'strictly', 'lone', 'wolf', 'Moses', 'team', 'assemble', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', '80-year-old', 'liver-cancered', 'rest', 'home', 'retiree', 'remarks', 'Well', ""'re"", 'getting', 'band', 'back', 'together', 'nice', 'maybe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'teach', 'old', 'dogs', 'new', 'tricks', 'old', 'dogs', 'have', 'perfected', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'Today', 'CIA', 'asshats', 'have', 'job', 'half', 'trying', 'curb', 'steal', 'phrase', 'Holly', 'Golightly', 'mean', 'REDs', 'absolutely', 'top', 'notch', 'cast', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'price', 'admission', 'just', 'see', 'terrific', 'old', 'pros', 'Willis', 'Freeman', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'play', 'actors', 'create', 'marvelous', 'synergy', 'even', 'sort', 'channel', 'old', 'Rat', 'Pack', 'cool', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'still', 'chops', 'pull', 'action', 'leading', 'man', 'role', 'quote', 'Warren', 'Ellis', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'One', 'most', 'amusing', 'tidbits', 'divulged', 'special', 'features', 'Mirren', 'patterned', 'assassin', 'character', 'immaculate', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'fresh', 'off', 'knocking', 'everyone', 'socks', 'off', 're-imagined', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'credible', 'even', 'likable', 'antagonist', 'More', 'old', 'far+s', 'get', 'dusted', 'off', 'cameos', 'such', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'CIA', 'venerable', 'records', 'keeper', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'sleazy', 'CEO', 'defense', 'contract', 'company.RED', 'brisk', 'cross-country', 'jaunts', 'root-for-the-badasss-geriatrics', 'theme', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'beats', 'also', 'just', 'off-kiltered', 'enough', 'make', 'seem', 'fresh', 'light', 'capery', 'touch', 'even', 'film', 'most', 'generic', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'sequences', 'Given', 'caliber', 'cast', 'RED', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'work', 'overtime', 'stink', 'up', 'joint', 'certainly', 'made', 'enough', 'killing', 'box', 'office', 'sequel', 'works.Of', 'course', 'Love', 'Savage', 'Secret.The', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'audio', 'commentary', 'retired', 'CIA', 'Field', 'Officer', 'RED', 'consultant', 'Robert', 'Baer', 'who', 'revealing', 'insights', 'regarding', 'film', 'plausibility', 'implausibility', '10', 'Deleted', 'Extended', 'Scenes', 'including', 'funny', 'scene', 'film', 'closing', 'moments', 'Frank', 'Marvin', 'mission', 'Moldova', '00:08:49', 'minutes', 'long', 'optional', 'running', 'RED', 'trivia', 'track', 'text', 'captions', 'film', 'Cast', 'Insights', '14', 'segments', 'covering', 'topics', 'such', 'set', 'location', 'shoots', 'action', 'sequences', 'awesomeness', 'cast', 'even', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Georgio', 'Armani', 'purse', 'totaling', '00:29:15', 'minutes', 'CIA', 'Exposed', 'disclosing', 'past', 'previously', 'secret', 'CIA', 'operations', 'including', 'one', 'project', 'focused', 'experimentation', 'cats', 'totaling', '00:05:59', 'minutes']",Red

Bruce Willis (Frank Moses) is suffering from that insanity.  He's a loner, his house lacking all the essential necessities to make it a home, and he's bored out of his mind.  He doesn't know how to blend into the neighborhood, pitifully viewing the landscape for what is expected. His desperation, his loneliness, and the inactivity of retirement leads him to tear up his retirement check and call an ever patient, equally lonely customer service agent in Kansas City.  The conversations with Sarah (Parker) are the highlight of his month and, through these conversations, he attempts to become more 'normal'.  Someone should tell Frank that a man reading a romance novel is not considered 'normal'.This retirement that eats at Frank's nerves is shattered when a hit squad attacks his house in the middle of the night.  Frank, as skilled as ever, kills the assassins.  Decades of training leads him to believe they have tapped his phone lines, and he's off to Kansas to save his phone buddy Sarah. Her reluctance to be saved (imagine someone you've only ever spoken to being in your home when you come back from an excrutiatingly boring date!) causes Frank to kidnap her.Sarah goes on a wild ride with Frank while he attempts to discover who is trying to kill him and why.  He travels cross country to find the members of his old black ops team, who are all equally retired and bored to death. Meanwhile, the viewer discovers the CIA is the machine behind the attempt on Frank's life.Morgan Freeman (Joe Black) is at his suave self, living in a retirement community and suffering from stage 4 cancer.  John Malkovich (LSD paranoid Marvin) hides in tunnels and carries a stuffed pig under his arm.  Helen Mirren proves that mature women can be sexy carrying a high powered rifle,and arranging flowers in a Better Homes and Garden style home. Her comment about taking an 'odd job on the side' still makes me laugh.This is an all-star cast of superb actors that deliver an action-packed, fast paced, comedic, and highly entertaining film.  The twists and turns are thrilling.

Throw in Brian Cox and Richard Dreyfuss, and that is an absolute murderer's row of acting.  And it's just as good as expected.The four main stars are RED, Retired Extremely Dangerous, ex-agents who are no longer predators but prey.  Or so the government and its lead agent (Karl Urban) think.  Willis leads the way like it's another installment of Die Hard, bringing along friends who he thought would make the movie-making experience enjoyable.  The professionalism, action, and comedy quickly creates familiarity and there isn't a dull point in the entire film.  To be quite honest, it's plays like the globe-trotting 20th sequel to Ocean's Eleven decades in the future.  Except in this version, Willis plays a better front-man than Clooney and Mirren is absolutely jaw-dropping in her ruthless portrayal as a wet-works expert.  The Freeman-Malkovich combo is collectively hilarious, with Freeman's easy playfulness and Malkovich's insane, paranoia providing a perfect complement to the rather straight-laced Willis spy games.Great movie from beginning to end, literally every base is covered and enjoyable.

This thing is intricately plotted, perfectly photographed, and extremely well cast! Although there was little or no profanity and no sweaty bodies, we did see a lot of gunfire, car chases and blowie uppie stuff. The audience ate it up!First, let's talk about that cast:*  Bruce Willis (""Cop Out"") is a former CIA black-ops agent, now he's Retired, Extremely Dangerous...get it? He's trying to deal with boredom and inertia, and has taken to calling a particular gal in a call center about a check he keeps insisting never arrived.*  Mary-Louise Parker (""Weeds"") is that gal (see above). She reads bodice-rippers like Love's Savage Fury and dreams of having a manly man come into her life and sweep her away to excitement, passion and exotic locales. She is hilarious!*  Morgan Freeman (""Invictus"") is another retired agent, now relegated to a nursing home where he is dealing with a terminal illness. He too, is bored and lonely; this is NOT the way he expected his life to end.*  John Malkovich (""Secretariat"") is also part of this bunch. He spent a few years being injected with LSD, so his hold on reality is a bit shaky, but he LOVES guns, ammo and explosives! Talk about a loose cannon!*  Helen Mirren (""The Last Station"") isn't quite as retired as her buddies; she admits she still ""takes a side job or two."" She can wield a machine gun with the best of them and still packs a yen for an agent she had to shoot.*  Ernest Borgnine (""SpongeBob SquarePants"") should have retired years ago, but he's still working in the CIA's top-top-secret archives.*  Richard Dreyfuss (""My Life in Ruins"") is an industrialist who knows WHY a mysterious list was made of people who MUST die.*  Karl Urban (""Star Trek"") is absolutely perfect as a new-generation black-ops agent, every bit as well trained and deadly as his predecessors. I'm always impressed by him.This terrific film was beautifully directed by Robert Schwentke (""The Time Travelers's Wife"") and I could hardly wait to get my DVD from Amazon.com.

Led by Bruce Willis playing, Frank Moses, a wry, Retired Extremely Dangerous agent who still has his skill set. The CIA is trying to kill him, collegue, Morgan Freeman & others for some unpleasantness that occurred in Central America years ago. So they set out to find out who & why. Early on Frank acquires a younger girl friend played by Mary Louise Parker. She is unwilling at first but they are trying to kill her too so she becomes an enthusiastic participant. The trail led to the vice president who turns out to be a master-mind criminal. So it is decided to kill him & prevent him from becoming president.

1358025,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B003Q6D2B4,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[2, 3]","RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) is an entertaining, slightly off-beat action-comedy about a group of former CIA black ops agents targeted for assassination.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) lives the quiet desperation of retired suburban life, his only outlet is a budding phone romance with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) a Federal Pension clerk.  Out of the blue a team of high-tech assassins suddenly comes after him, setting him on the trail to find out why.  Sarah becomes embroiled in the mess from her connection to Frank as he tracks down his old partners Joe (Morgan Freeman) and Marvin (John Malkovic), who are also on the hit list.  To ensure the success of the mission the CIA brings in a rising young star named Cooper (Karl Urban) to complete the job.  Along the way Frank enlists the aid of a former KGB operative Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox) and former MI6 asset Victoria (Helen Mirren) to unravel the conspiracy against them, which goes higher than they could have imagined.The film is based upon the DC Comics graphic novels, which I was unaware of, so I don't how it measures up to the source material.  The script is fun and funny with lots of characterization and backstory to help tie things together.  The little things add up: Frank's trying to connect better with Sarah by reading the same books she does, Frank and Ivan reminiscing about the old days and other small scenes like these help bring it up a notch above the standard fare.  The whole movie is fun and energetic, with the certain level of silliness you'd expect from it, but a couple of times it lands in the wrong places.The actors were good in their roles but Morgan Freeman's screentime is too brief and Mary-Louise Parker's character reminded too much of Nancy from Weeds.  But they all play off each other very well, and I wasn't expecting the appearances of Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, Julian McMahon, Ernest Borgnine and James Remar- any of whom are a bonus.One of the best things about the movie was the music.  A nice mix of Chicago Blues, southern guitar and R&B; bass is used for transitions and travel music, and there's a little Aerosmith and some good funky riffs thrown into the action sequences all of which work nicely and sound great.  Go over to the website and you'll hear a couple of riffs: [...] This is a soundtrack I definitely want!RED is an entertaining popcorn flick with some nice laughs and ok action.  The draw is more in the star power than the story.  Don't expect too much out of it and you'll enjoy it for what it is.

1358051,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B003Q6D2B4,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[2, 3]","I love action flicks. What's even better about ""Red"" as an action flick is its cast. And this is not just any cast, but one filled only with retirement age actors (well, maybe Bruce Willis isn't quite there, but he acts as if he is). OK, maybe Mary Louise Parker isn't quite there either, but she's also excellent as Willis's love interest.So, what's to like about an action flick starring old actors? (When one is the same age as the actors, one is allowed to call them old.)1. Humor in an action flick? Yeah, it's been done for years--Clint Eastwood and Schwarzenegger with their punchy one-liners. This time Morgan Freeman gets the line: ""We're getting the band back together."" It was funny in the television promos--it's even funnier in context. Ms Parker expresses her extreme displeasure with the Willis characther--with her mouth duct-taped! While the viewer may not know the exact words behind her anger, her meaning is quite clear. It's an excellent delivery complete with facial expressions and perfect comedic timing.2. Romance. Willis and Parker? Yes, and the actors make it work even though he is retired R-E-D (retired, extremely dangerous) and she is a seemingly mild-mannered, cubicle-retirement clerk. However, in their conversations together he learns the way to divine her heart. He reads all the romance novels she reads. She also has a true hankering to travel to exotic places. When she tells him she wants to go to Chile, he says he's been there. The thing with his travels is the reason and the time, often by cover of night and to relieve someone of his ugly, hateful life. He's been to Chile, but hasn't experienced Chile.3. Larger than life characters.Freeman has participated in Vietnam and Afghanistan and now is 80 years old (is Freeman really that old?) and living in a nice retirement home with his dose of excitement gained from eyeballing a beautiful, young aid's gluts. He also has stage four liver cancer.Helen Mirren as the lovely, refined mistress of a country estate, filling her hours with baking and flower arranging--and the occasional hit. As she tells Ms Parker: ""I kill people.""Karl Urban plays the adversary--a deep CIA special ops hit man. His job is to eliminate Willis's character. The reasons are eventually revealed and they are a doozy.John Malkovich plays an over-the-top paranoid, well, an Oliver Stone type. But Malkovich is hilarious, especially showing his pleasure at Willis's storage facility filled with weapons and munitions of extreme measures.3. An expose of the great and secret powers of the CIA. Ernest Borgnine's character and his job and its location and purpose are prime examples. But there's more.4. Weapons galore! Fun with weapons! An example: one soldier shoots a grenade at Malkovich who uses his weapon to bat it back to the soldier who then is blown up. A fierce, red-headed, female agent calls Malkovich Grandpa. He must show her what ""grandpas"" can do. She shoots a small missile at him--he shoots a bullet from a handgun directly into the center of that missile, causing blow back of the explosion and getting rid of that potty mouth agent (older people don't like being reminded of their age!)5. A serious message amid all the shenanigans: the abuse of power in whatever place for whatever reason. Richard Dreyfus plays--with great flair--a powerful villain and how his power has distorted whatever tenuous connection he may have with the human race.6. Quirkiness (but I suppose part of the humor)--Mirren wears a lovely, long white evening gown to a presidential party bid. Later Malkovich gives her a pair of combat boots to wear for their role in taking down the powerfully corrupt. Just a little quirky! Malkovich's house is inside a car. Let me rephrase. One enters his dwelling through the trunk. That's all I'll say.7. I could put Brian Cox in any category. As a retired Soviet spy who hasn't killed anyone in years, he is almost a scene stealer.What a fun, fun movie (despite the various forms of violence). There's only one kiss, no, make that two (Freeman gets one) and just a few I love you's, giving this action flick a touch of heart.",5,"Fun, fun, fun!",1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,4128,"['love', 'action', 'flicks', 'What', 'even', 'better', 'Red', 'action', 'flick', 'cast', 'not', 'just', 'cast', 'one', 'filled', 'only', 'retirement', 'age', 'actors', 'well', 'maybe', 'Bruce', 'Willis', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'OK', 'maybe', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', ""n't"", 'quite', 'either', 'also', 'excellent', 'Willis', 'love', 'interest.So', 'what', 'like', 'action', 'flick', 'starring', 'old', 'actors', 'When', 'one', 'same', 'age', 'actors', 'one', 'allowed', 'call', '1', 'Humor', 'action', 'flick', 'Yeah', 'been', 'done', 'years', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Schwarzenegger', 'punchy', 'one-liners', 'time', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'line', ""'re"", 'getting', 'band', 'back', 'together', 'was', 'funny', 'television', 'promos', 'even', 'funnier', 'context', 'Ms', 'Parker', 'extreme', 'displeasure', 'Willis', 'characther', 'mouth', 'duct-taped', 'viewer', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'exact', 'words', 'anger', 'meaning', 'quite', 'clear', 'excellent', 'delivery', 'complete', 'facial', 'expressions', 'perfect', 'comedic', 'timing.2', 'Romance', 'Willis', 'Parker', 'Yes', 'actors', 'make', 'work', 'even', 'retired', 'R-E-D', 'retired', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'seemingly', 'mild-mannered', 'cubicle-retirement', 'clerk', 'However', 'conversations', 'together', 'way', 'divine', 'heart', 'romance', 'novels', 'also', 'true', 'hankering', 'travel', 'exotic', 'places', 'When', 'go', 'Chile', 'been', 'there', 'thing', 'travels', 'reason', 'time', 'often', 'cover', 'night', 'relieve', 'someone', 'ugly', 'hateful', 'life', 'been', 'Chile', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'Chile.3', 'Larger', 'life', 'characters.Freeman', 'participated', 'Vietnam', 'Afghanistan', 'now', '80', 'years', 'old', 'Freeman', 'really', 'old', 'living', 'nice', 'retirement', 'home', 'dose', 'excitement', 'gained', 'eyeballing', 'beautiful', 'young', 'aid', 'gluts', 'also', 'stage', 'four', 'liver', 'cancer.Helen', 'Mirren', 'lovely', 'refined', 'mistress', 'country', 'estate', 'filling', 'hours', 'baking', 'flower', 'arranging', 'occasional', 'hit', 'Ms', 'Parker', 'kill', 'people', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'adversary', 'deep', 'CIA', 'special', 'ops', 'hit', 'man', 'job', 'eliminate', 'Willis', 'character', 'reasons', 'are', 'eventually', 'revealed', 'are', 'doozy.John', 'Malkovich', 'over-the-top', 'paranoid', 'well', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'type', 'Malkovich', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'showing', 'pleasure', 'Willis', 'storage', 'facility', 'filled', 'weapons', 'munitions', 'extreme', 'measures.3', 'expose', 'great', 'secret', 'powers', 'CIA', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'character', 'job', 'location', 'purpose', 'are', 'prime', 'examples', 'more.4', 'Weapons', 'galore', 'Fun', 'weapons', 'example', 'one', 'soldier', 'grenade', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'weapon', 'bat', 'back', 'soldier', 'who', 'then', 'blown', 'up', 'A', 'fierce', 'red-headed', 'female', 'agent', 'Malkovich', 'Grandpa', 'must', 'show', 'what', 'grandpas', 'can', 'do', 'shoots', 'small', 'missile', 'bullet', 'handgun', 'directly', 'center', 'missile', 'causing', 'blow', 'back', 'explosion', 'getting', 'rid', 'potty', 'mouth', 'agent', 'older', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'reminded', 'age', '5', 'serious', 'message', 'shenanigans', 'abuse', 'power', 'place', 'reason', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'great', 'flair', 'powerful', 'villain', 'how', 'power', 'distorted', 'tenuous', 'connection', 'may', 'have', 'human', 'race.6', 'Quirkiness', 'suppose', 'part', 'humor', 'Mirren', 'lovely', 'long', 'white', 'evening', 'gown', 'presidential', 'party', 'bid', 'Later', 'Malkovich', 'pair', 'combat', 'boots', 'wear', 'role', 'taking', 'down', 'powerfully', 'corrupt', 'Just', 'little', 'quirky', 'Malkovich', 'house', 'car', 'Let', 'rephrase', 'One', 'dwelling', 'trunk', ""'ll"", 'say.7', 'could', 'put', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'category', 'retired', 'Soviet', 'spy', 'who', ""n't"", 'killed', 'anyone', 'years', 'almost', 'scene', 'fun', 'fun', 'movie', 'various', 'forms', 'violence', 'only', 'one', 'kiss', 'make', 'two', 'Freeman', 'one', 'just', 'few', 'love', 'giving', 'action', 'touch', 'heart']",Red

But let's face it -- many of us go to the movies not to be educated or culturally refined, but to be entertained.  I know I've enjoyed my share of brainless but fun blockbusters, such as the ""Transformers"" film series and the ""A-Team"" movie, and will gladly choose a Pixar or Disney movie over a more ""arty"" foreign film.  There are wonderful, art-worthy Oscar contenders that I will probably never watch again, simply because though I acknowledge they are good, they just weren't fun, while less artistically impressive movies will become a hit with me because of how much I enjoyed myself watching them.""RED"" is not an Oscar contender, and has absolutely no pretense of making a statement or considering itself high art.  But it's a blast nonetheless.(For the record -- no, I have not read the comic series this is based on, so I'm judging the film solely on its own merits.)Frank Moses is a ""RED"" (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) CIA agent, trying to grow accustomed to a quiet civilian life and having slightly flirty phone conversations with Sarah, the customer service agent at his pension office.  His attempts to relax and enjoy retirement are shattered when a hit squad attacks his house one night, sending him on the run.  With a rather reluctant Sarah in tow, he makes a cross-country trip to round up his old CIA buddies -- Joe, terminally ill but still kicking; Marvin, paranoid and deliciously crazy; Victoria, an elegant and soft-spoken ""wetwork"" agent; and ex-Russian secret agent Ivan.  As they put together the pieces and discover their team is being hunted down due to their connection with a military disaster in Guatemala, Frank is being pursued by young CIA agent and family man William Cooper, who follows orders with chilling precision but is seemingly unaware that he's being used as a tool by higher forces...By far the best part of this film is the cast, containing such heavy hitters as Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, and Richard Dreyfuss.  All of them look like they're having an absolute blast making this movie, and sling hot lead and sharp one-liners with equal zest.  John Malkovich chews quite a bit of scenery as Marvin, easily making him one of the funniest characters in the film, and Helen Mirren shines as Victoria, obviously having fun being a proper lady with a machine gun.  Richard Dreyfuss has only a few scenes as a smirky weapons dealer, but he hams it up enough that he's quite memorable.  Morgan Freeman plays against type as Joe and has relatively few scenes for being one of the top-credited names, and Bruce Willis seems to be running mostly on autopilot as Frank Moses, but they're still both fun to watch and have some good lines.  Mary-Louis Parker is sweet and spunky as Sarah, and Karl Urban (probably best known for ""Star Trek"") is mostly playing straight man to the rest of the crew as Cooper, but does his job well enough that I can see him carrying a ""Bourne"" style action series on his own.The film operates solely on ""Rule of Cool,"" eschewing realism for over-the-top explosions and loads of gunfire and fist-swinging action.  I don't particularly mind this, as I was enjoying the ride too much to nitpick at any errors.  This film knows what it is, and never has any pretense at art or high-minded storytelling.  The downside is that the plot tends to fall by the wayside in favor of fight and shoot-out scenes, but there's a good deal of humor, character development, and even a sweet romance to make up for any deficiencies in the plot.Very fun and entertaining action flick, with good actors and memorable jokes and scenes carrying the movie quite well despite the fairly weak plot.  If you want a fun action flick, ""RED"" is a good choice, with something for just about everybody.  It's not going to win any awards, but it's sure going to entertain you.P.S.  There's talk of a sequel... and reportedly when Helen Mirren was asked what it would take to get her into the sequel, she said ""just send me a script.""

Where the premise is about retired government assassins being hunted down and joining together to protect each other, themselves had me thinking this was going to be some extreme action flick, particularly with Bruce Willis as one of its stars.  Instead it was one of the funnier films I've seen Willis in and his co-stars, all of whom I expect for more dramatic roles, made it even more pleasant:  Helen Mirren (adore her work), Morgan Freeman (plays God often enough, he must be a close friend and still can give us the drama and the laughs he did much earlier in his career), John Malcovich.  The name alone tells you you're going to get a great performance from a great actor.  Here he plays the ""off"" a little character, again, but unforgettably.  And refreshing to the cast is Mary-Louise Parker.  Caught up in the adventure by being in the right place at the wrong time.

1358173,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003Q6D2B4,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I've been a fan of Bruce Willis for some time now. From his first major appearance on MOONLIGHTING through the DIE HARD films, I've made a point to see his films when they are released. When I heard that he was starring in RED, based on the comic book of the same name, I was anxious to see how it turned out. And while it plays loose with the source material, it ends up being one of my favorite films from last year.The story revolves around Frank Moses (Willis), a retired ""Agency"" assassin living a boring life that has become far too routine for him. To pass the time he calls Sarah Ross (Mary Louise Parker), the woman who handles payments to retired employees of a company she only knows as legit with no clue as to his past. Each month he calls to tell her the check didn't arrive, even though it did, and the two have a conversation. Both are bored and lonely and strike up a phone friendship.Unfortunately for Frank the ""Agency"" monitors all of its ex-employees designated RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) and don't take kindly to them making consistent phone calls. Rather than assume nothing despicable is going on, they're more prone to think secrets are being leaked or some other nefarious plot is in the works. So they send a strike team to take out Frank one night. But as his designated retirement status claims, Frank is not someone you should mess with. The team is taken out and Frank is on the run.His first stop is to find Sarah who he realizes he has accidentally placed in danger. Rescuing her and with her still not quite ready to believe his story, they head out to find other members of his old team. Like conspiracy minded Marvin Boggs who thinks everyone is out to get him played fantastically by John Malkovich. Then Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) who welcomes the chance to escape his retirement home for some action like the old days. And finally there is Victoria (Helen Mirren), set up in peaceful tranquility...with the exception of taking on the occasional assassination.Brought back together by circumstances the team is on the move to find out who it was that authorized the hit and why. On their tail is ""Agency"" man William Cooper (Karl Urban), a top notch agent who could be Frank's match. If it wasn't for the fact that Frank taught Cooper's trainer everything he knew...but not all that Frank knew.Crosses and double crosses flow throughout the story as the team follows one lead to another in an attempt to find out just who is behind the uproar. Everyone from a weapons manufacturer (Richard Dreyfuss) to the Vice President become suspects but it isn't until the final moments that we discover just who the culprit is.Along the way there are plenty of explosions, jokes and hand to hand combat moments that should keep Willis and action fans sitting on the edge of their seats. By the last reel you'll find yourself wishing that the movie hadn't ended and that another was on the way. Thank goodness the rumor mill has it that their planning a sequel.The action is non-stop, the effects are top notch and the acting is some of the best I've seen. To me the best acting doesn't involve the ability to simply say your lines in the most dramatic way possible. Instead, the best acting is when you completely forget the fact that you're watching a movie, that the person performing is an actor and you totally believe that for two hours they ARE that person. Such are the performances by all involved here.But best of all with this movie is the fact that for 111 minutes you are entertained. And in the long run isn't that what it's all about? No, this film will not find most involved nominated for any Oscars but the truth is that some of the most entertaining films made never do. Instead they find fans who watch the film over and over again. This is one of those movies, a film that I for one feel I could watch more than three times and never be bored with.

Now living a very uneventful life, Frank finds solace and companionship with Sarah (Mary Louise Parker), a seemingly bored customer service representative. Monthly he uses the excuse of his checks being issued in the wrong amount to work his way into her life. After an attempt is made on his life, the unknown enemy decides to kidnap his new love interest and use her for bait, which inevitably turns in a game of cat and mouse. Determined to rescue her and discover the truth, Moses visits other retired agents seeking their help. And what a group of talented actors, who each brought an authentic quality to their roles (with the exception of one that I will mention later). Joe (Morgan Freeman) is living in a retirement home, literally dying and this seems to be an opportunity for some last minute fun. Victoria (Helen Miran) is enjoying her life as a simple woman (who once put three bullets thru the man she loved simply because the agency wanted her to) and would remind you of a loveable but deadly grandmother. Paranoid, conspiracy theorist Marvin (played by the delightful John Malkovich) is only to willing to show Moses how the present events are related to a past transgression of someone they know.  Ivan (Brian Cox) is simply willing to spend time with the woman who he has never stopped loving, even if she shot him (3 times) and left him for dead. There is the devoted and dedicated CIA Agent who will stop at nothing to get his man. And finally, there is the very shady Alexander (Richard Dreyfuss) who is not what he appears, and who believes that he single handedly has created the Vice President (Julian McMahan) who is destined to be President. Both are willing to stop at nothing in an effort to protect a secret. Eventually, Moses figures out why they all have been scheduled for elimination and works hard to reveal the truth.I thought that this was a decent movie with a great cast. However, I did struggle with the final rating and ended up giving this movie a 3.5 to 4. I tend to rate it higher because the fabulous actors made me overlook the defects in the storyline. The only character that I was never sure about was that of Sarah. I kept thinking that the final twist should have been that she was an agent meant to seduce Moses but also learn the truth (or something...more), instead she just seemed a little too simple lacking the same depth that the other characters. She moved from wanting to get away, to falling into line wanting to participate in a dangerous adventure. I don't know, she was the only character that I really didn't like, which was hard since she was the center of the storyline. Perhaps another actress would have made the character more likeable for me. Anyway, I definitely would recommend this for someone who is looking for just the right amount of humor and adventure.",4,Great cast + interesting plot = decent movie!,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,2902,"['Someone', 'Frank', 'Moses', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'retired', 'CIA/assassin', 'dead', 'Now', 'living', 'very', 'uneventful', 'life', 'Frank', 'solace', 'companionship', 'Sarah', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'seemingly', 'bored', 'customer', 'service', 'representative', 'excuse', 'checks', 'being', 'issued', 'wrong', 'amount', 'work', 'way', 'life', 'attempt', 'made', 'life', 'unknown', 'enemy', 'decides', 'kidnap', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'use', 'bait', 'inevitably', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Determined', 'rescue', 'discover', 'truth', 'Moses', 'other', 'retired', 'agents', 'seeking', 'help', 'what', 'group', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'brought', 'authentic', 'quality', 'roles', 'exception', 'one', 'will', 'mention', 'later', 'Joe', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'living', 'retirement', 'home', 'literally', 'dying', 'be', 'opportunity', 'last', 'minute', 'fun', 'Victoria', 'Helen', 'Miran', 'enjoying', 'life', 'simple', 'woman', 'who', 'once', 'put', 'three', 'bullets', 'thru', 'man', 'loved', 'simply', 'agency', 'wanted', 'would', 'remind', 'loveable', 'deadly', 'grandmother', 'Paranoid', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'Marvin', 'played', 'delightful', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'only', 'willing', 'show', 'Moses', 'how', 'present', 'events', 'are', 'related', 'past', 'transgression', 'someone', 'know', 'Ivan', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'simply', 'willing', 'spend', 'time', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'stopped', 'loving', 'even', 'shot', '3', 'times', 'left', 'dead', 'devoted', 'dedicated', 'CIA', 'Agent', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'man', 'finally', 'very', 'shady', 'Alexander', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'not', 'what', 'who', 'single', 'handedly', 'created', 'Vice', 'President', 'Julian', 'McMahan', 'who', 'destined', 'be', 'President', 'are', 'willing', 'stop', 'nothing', 'effort', 'protect', 'secret', 'Eventually', 'Moses', 'out', 'why', 'have', 'been', 'scheduled', 'elimination', 'hard', 'reveal', 'truth.I', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'However', 'did', 'struggle', 'final', 'rating', 'ended', 'up', 'giving', 'movie', '3.5', '4', 'tend', 'rate', 'higher', 'fabulous', 'actors', 'made', 'overlook', 'defects', 'storyline', 'only', 'character', 'was', 'never', 'sure', 'was', 'Sarah', 'kept', 'thinking', 'final', 'twist', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'agent', 'meant', 'seduce', 'Moses', 'also', 'learn', 'truth', 'something', 'more', 'instead', 'just', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'simple', 'lacking', 'same', 'depth', 'other', 'characters', 'moved', 'wanting', 'get', 'away', 'falling', 'line', 'wanting', 'participate', 'dangerous', 'adventure', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'only', 'character', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'hard', 'was', 'center', 'storyline', 'Perhaps', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'character', 'more', 'likeable', 'Anyway', 'definitely', 'would', 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', 'looking', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'humor', 'adventure']",Red

Like the Expendables Red brings in many famous actors like Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, etc. and they embark on a crazy adventure together.  In the film these individuals are retired CIA agents.  However, because of the CIA hunting them down they are forced out of retirement and kick ass once again.  It is an awesome concept (especially with such big names), but one that does not live up to what it could have been.First off the entire story is very basic and not deep or engaging at all.  A simple story can work if I am entertained, and in this case I wasn't really.  The action scenes are nothing to run home about.  They were alright, but I have seen much better in countless action films like Expendables and Expendables 2.  The villain played by Richard Dreyfuss is lame as well.  He is very basic and has no depth what-so ever.  Plus he gets defeated way too easily.  A big problem with the film is that the final action scene is extremely anticlimactic.  The heroes beat the villain without much of a hitch.The characters are hit or miss for me.  Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Brian Cox are a lot of fun in the film.  Bruce Willis does a good job performance wise, but I found his character to be bland compared to most of the rest of the main cast.  Carl Urban's character I did not really care for either.  He is presented as a rival for Bruce Willis but comes off as more of a nuisance.Sarah Ross, who played on the show Weeds, I did not like at all.  She plays Bruce Willis's love interest and the token damsel in distress.  I found her useless and very annoying.  In terms of the comedy her jokes were the weakest and did nothing for me.  She was really only in the film to appeal to a demographic.  She should have been left out and focused on the main group kicking ass.Overall, Red is a mediocre action film at best.  Some of the characters are a lot of fun.  However, other characters were annoying like Sarah Ross and Richard Dreyfuss's character.  Plus you have an uninteresting story, bland villains, and mediocre action scenes.  I know that this is based on a comic.  I do not know if this is how the comic was because I have not read it.

Some of the action scenes are interesting, like when Bruce Willis gets out of a moving car and starts shooting without missing a beat, while others are rather bland.

People spending twelve bucks and expecting a top blu-ray release and transfer...go rent it instead! Does the phrase ""you get what you pay for"" sound familiar? The 'cheaper' movie only is not to be aimed at people that are into high quality, top notch blu-ray transfers. This is aimed at the people who 'just want to see the movie in other than DVD format'. This explains the single layer pressing with non-lossy audio. For a few extra bucks get the special edition and quit crying already!! You are giving this product a bad rap because you make bad choices by getting the cheapest version out there. The special edition I have is a flipper disc, which I know are trouble, with DVD on the flip-side. The blu-ray played without a glitch. Don't know if the special edition Amazon offers includes DVD or not, but I do know that the special edition is pressed at a much higher bit-rate than the cheap movie only disc. And it does include a DTS-HD soundtrack that really rocks!!! Plus it has great special features (including an all access pass).So don't be mislead by the bad reviews of the movie-only edition and get this special edition and leave your brains at the door and you will have fun!Enjoy!!",5,"WOW!!

There's plenty of over-the-top action that's fun, it's hilarious, and overall it's a fun movie if all you ask for is just some pure escapist fun.In the end, RED is definitely not art or Oscar material, but it is one of the most fun movies of 2010, and recommended for some pure entertainment!",4,Any dull moments?

R.E.D. stands for ""Retired and Extremely Dangerous,"" and that's exactly what they are. The cast of RED is questionable for an action movie on paper (except for John McClane), but after seeing them all in action, it's better than I ever imagined. I had neutral expectations for this film, and I'm happy to say it's a pleasant surprise. Bruce Willis is as great as he's been in a while. That isn't saying much because he has not had much energy lately, but the rest of the cast picks up his slack tenfold. John Malkovich is amazing. He is genuinely hilarious. I thought it took some kind of special skill to make people laugh every time you spoke. He isn't a comedian, but whatever it is, he has it. The man is pure comedic genius in this movie. See it for him if nothing else. Malkovich isn't it though. There is also Helen Mirren in a fur coat and military boots, with a big @ss gun. Something worth mentioning is that they trained her well with those guns. The lady did not blink or close her eyes when shooting, like I'd expect her to. Just a straight face. I loved that. I really believed she was a trained killer. She is badass beyond words, yet manages to stay classy. How does she do it? The Queen with a freaking sniper rifle? Yes. And there is also Morgan Freeman. His last role was a President, now he's a retired agent. And he's great in his role, but don't expect to see him for too long.The rest of the cast is good too. Ernest Borgnine made me smile in his tiny role, and I enjoyed Richard Dreyfuss. Yeah, the cast is full of older actors, but you won't be able to tell. I have to say that Mary Louise Parker was a little annoying at times, but she doesn't hinder the movie overall. The performances are great, but what else is there? The comedy aspect of the film is better than the action to be honest. I laughed a lot, and so did the rest of the audience. There are a couple of action scenes that will make you cheer though. Mainly the airport scene. I won't go into detail, but I think everyone will like that part, despite their feelings on the rest of the movie. Besides what I've mentioned, there isn't too much to else to the movie. I enjoyed the locale hopping. It was sort of Bond-like, but it stayed within the U.S. I also enjoyed the plot. It was slightly complex, but very easy to follow for the dimwits in the audience. No offense, to those of you who are dimwitted. :P I think this is a movie that will be very enjoyable to those of you who can ignore slight inconsistencies in the narrative and just enjoy the mayhem.

It is the sort of movie that would not work, however, if we didn't already have pretty strong impressions and feelings about its stars.  If we didn't already think of Helen Mirren as the classy actress who won an Oscar for THE QUEEN...we wouldn't laugh simply at the sight of her wielding a machine gun.  If we didn't mostly think of Morgan Freeman for playing God or the President or the silky-toned narrator of MARCH OF THE PENGUINS...we wouldn't chuckle at his antics.  Quite frankly, if you enjoyed the trailers for RED, you'll enjoy the movie.  They give you an almost complete sense of the tone of this film.  If you thought the trailers looked merely silly and made you roll your eyes...then the movie will simply multiply that feeling.Personally, I thought it was a lot of fun.  The actors are clearly having a ball, and Bruce Willis (who doesn't really come across as old enough to be retired...especially when he can still win fistfights left and right) makes a good host.  He's coasting here, but as movie-goers, we're so comfortable with Willis and his shaved head that it feels a little like we're just visiting an old friend.  Mary Louise Parker (WEEDS) is his sort-of love interest, a call center worker he's been flirting with long distance but who now joins in on the escapades.  She does a nice job evolving from meek to really enjoying the dangerous antics.  Mirren and Freeman are fun.  Brian Cox shows up as a retired Soviet agent, and he sparkles in his over-the-top accent.  Richard Dreyfuss appears in a couple of scenes and chews scenery.  You have to almost feel sorry for Karl Urban as the assassin on Willis' trail...he doesn't get to have much fun...but he acquits himself well.  I can almost envision him doing well as the star of a straight-laced action series on CBS.Best of all is the hilarious John Malkovich.  He steals every scene he's in with amazing ease.  As the craziest of the REDs, he gets to let his tendencies to overact mightily just run wild...and it all works.  His facial expressions alone had the audience in stitches.RED is not a classic film by any means.  But I must say, the 110 minutes I spent with these guys was a complete, guilty-pleasure blast.  Maybe I'm just the right age (46) to enjoy this particular cast goofing around...but I sure noticed a lot of happy looking teens and 20-somethings all around me.

In both films impossible violence against the CIA and the U.S. Government is justified by the slaughter of vative villages--in Ethiopia ['Shooter'] and in Guatemala ['Red'].Anyway, it seems that Willis, Freeman etc. [senior citizens all] are more lethal, dangerous and well-armed than were 50 Clint Eastwoods.  These guys are real terrors.  They mow down equally well-armed and far more numerous CIA men without getting hit themselves [of course].  Standard Action-Adventure fare, if you think about it.

He always shows up where he isn't expected and just in the nick of time.  Amazing.Obviously this dreck cost quite a lot of money to make--well-known actors and plenty of special effects.

I'd read some good & some bad reviews, so I set my expectation to Low and bought a ticket.Was I glad I saw this!  An entertaining movie that doesn't take itself seriously, but doesn't insult the audience's intelligence, either.Bruce Willis plays retired CIA agent Frank Moses (who's apparently collecting about $2400 a month--a pretty paltry pension for having saved the world) who all of a sudden finds himself on the lam from teams of assassins out to silence him.Of course, the assassins have more toys but fewer smarts than he does, so after killing a few and eluding a few more, he connects with Sarah Ross (played by Mary-Louise Parker) who at first thinks he's crazy but eventually joins Moses as he defeats Pharoah and parts the Red Sea (oops, different Moses, different movie)...no, wait, as he heads to Pensacola to recruit mega-paranoid buddy Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich, who for once has a suitable outlet for his natural weirdness).Then it's off to...Wait, why am I writing all this?  If you've made it this far, just go with it.  To make a long story short, Frank Moses ""gets the band back together"" to fight the bad guys and save the day.Have you ever wanted to see Helen Mirren fire a submachine gun and a Browning fifty-cal?  Then this is your movie.  Probably enough of a selling point for any guy who appreciates the charms of Ms. Mirren.And another treat for those old enough to have seen the Beatles live on Ed Sullivan--Ernest Borgnine has a small but important part.  Just think, he was born not long after the end of World War I, and he's still acting.  God love him.So if all that sort of thing sounds remotely interesting, give Red a try.

You sort of have to piece it together as you go along.  And as the layers to the plot are discovered, you have a good laugh and lots of fun and surprises along the way.Bruce Willis plays Frank Moses, an ex CIA agent whose file has been stamped RED - Retired, Extremely Dangerous.  He lives a quiet life on a quiet street, ripping up his pension check just so he can call in and speak to the lovely Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) at the Pension office.  They talk about books and traveling, and then Frank's house gets shot up by the bad FBI guys.  Frank kicks butt and gets the heck out of there.After picking up Sarah, who might find herself in trouble with the CIA just for talking to him, he sets out to find why he's suddenly become a target.  Along the way, he reconnects with some old, but deadly, colleagues played by Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren. Together, they find out the black-ops are out to kill a list of people who were present in Guatemala when the now Vice President committed war crimes.  With his plan to run for President, he needs to get rid of some dirty laundry, and Frank's name is on the laundry list.John Malkovich is superb as a crazed gunman who fears everyone is out to get him - the government, the web, the satellites, the helicopters flying over. The government tests involving daily injections of LSD back in the day didn't help much!  The gun chases are over the top hilarious thanks to John, his big guns, and classic one liners!Morgan Freeman is...well, Morgan Freeman who never disappoints.  But Helen Mirren, a bread-and-breakfast flowering arranging, meal planning, elder is also a deadly assassin who loves to kill people.  She's also in love with their Russian adversary who has always wanted to kill a U.S. President, played by highly versatile Brian Cox.This is a movie not intended to be taken too seriously.  The big guns and big explosions often had me laughing out loud at times because the characters take the action very seriously, and you can't help but laugh at the old Western-like face offs. See this movie for the unbelievable cast, and for its hilarity.Bruce Willis followers won't be disappointed, although Bruce's character is a bit reserved this time. There's not a lot of classic emotional connection in the storyline between you and the characters or with between the characters themselves, but that's okay.

Sarah is bored and lonely and wanting adventure in her life ... and gets more than she could ever hope for when someone from Frank's past sends a battalion of commando-like assassins to kill him - the bad guys going after Sarah, in turn, as she's been the only person Frank has contacted in some time! Frank, forced to sort of kidnap Sarah just to rescue her, goes on the run, but is soon forced back into his old ""line of work"" when he has to put together his team of deadly agents from the past - all of them now classified as ""RED"" (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) - to stay alive and find out just what the hell is going on.I really enjoyed this film, filled with action and suspense but also humor.

1358458,A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B003Q6D2B4,"Stella Carrier ""joyfulwoman2078""","[1, 1]","When I first saw the previews to the movie, I was honestly unsure if I wanted to see it only because the movie seemed to be scripted to former CIA agents that want revenge. While it is fine to have such a script, I was wondering how exciting it was going to be. Then they showed the preview of John Malkovich saying ""Old my (you know what) shooting at a younger assasin who seemed to be in for the shock of her life after realizing that he had more fighting ability than initially realized. It was then I decided to see it because something about that scene made me realize that the movie was going to be more eventful than what I was seeing in the trailer. Fortunately, I am glad that I decided to go with this feeling. This movie has a strong all star cast of actors and actresses featuring Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich who end up going on a ""adventure/preserving their life mission"" after finding out that very powerful people in government want them dead for some reason. From my perspective, The plot was a combination of dark comedy and action. The two actors that stood out the most for me in the movie were John Malkovich and Helen Mirren.  Helen Mirren stood out because she plays a strong and self confident former CIA operative who is ready at a moment's notice to go on ""the odd jobs here and there"" whenever she is needed. I like that she plays a very assertive and powerful person who knows what she wants. She also seems like the type of person that is comfortable and happy with herself in real-life from the strong performance she gave in the movie. I am a college student who is obviously from a different generation than she is, but I am inspired by Helen's example and intend to be an extremely self-confident person by the time that I reach the life stage that she is in now.  I enjoyed John Malkovich's performance very much because he played a gifted but extremely paranoid former operative that was frequently looking over his shoulder for perceived threats in a very powerful and with the right amount of forceful manner. As it turns out, his paranoia many times is justified. He really adds excitement and humor to the movie in his role as a talented but guarded former CIA operative. The best indicators I can say is if you like your movies with a mix of dark comedy, action, drama, and suspense then chances are good that you are going to enjoy this movie.",5,Ready and Extremely Determined,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,2414,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'was', 'honestly', 'unsure', 'wanted', 'see', 'only', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'scripted', 'former', 'CIA', 'agents', 'want', 'revenge', 'fine', 'have', 'script', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'exciting', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Then', 'showed', 'preview', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'saying', 'Old', 'know', 'what', 'shooting', 'younger', 'assasin', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'shock', 'life', 'realizing', 'had', 'more', 'fighting', 'ability', 'initially', 'realized', 'was', 'then', 'decided', 'see', 'something', 'scene', 'made', 'realize', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'eventful', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'Fortunately', 'am', 'glad', 'decided', 'go', 'feeling', 'movie', 'strong', 'star', 'cast', 'actors', 'actresses', 'featuring', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'adventure/preserving', 'life', 'mission', 'finding', 'out', 'very', 'powerful', 'people', 'government', 'want', 'dead', 'reason', 'perspective', 'plot', 'was', 'combination', 'dark', 'comedy', 'action', 'two', 'actors', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'movie', 'were', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'stood', 'out', 'strong', 'self', 'confident', 'former', 'CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'ready', 'moment', 'notice', 'go', 'odd', 'jobs', 'here', 'there', 'whenever', 'needed', 'like', 'very', 'assertive', 'powerful', 'person', 'who', 'what', 'also', 'type', 'person', 'comfortable', 'happy', 'real-life', 'strong', 'performance', 'gave', 'movie', 'am', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'obviously', 'different', 'generation', 'am', 'inspired', 'Helen', 'example', 'intend', 'be', 'extremely', 'self-confident', 'person', 'time', 'reach', 'life', 'stage', 'now', 'enjoyed', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'performance', 'very', 'much', 'played', 'gifted', 'extremely', 'paranoid', 'former', 'operative', 'was', 'frequently', 'looking', 'shoulder', 'perceived', 'threats', 'very', 'powerful', 'right', 'amount', 'forceful', 'manner', 'out', 'paranoia', 'many', 'times', 'justified', 'really', 'excitement', 'humor', 'movie', 'role', 'talented', 'guarded', 'former', 'CIA', 'operative', 'best', 'indicators', 'can', 'say', 'like', 'movies', 'mix', 'dark', 'comedy', 'action', 'drama', 'suspense', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'going', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Red

1358466,A26MJME9IBNETY,B003Q6D2B4,StrangePegs,"[2, 3]","The comic that the movie is based on was written by Warren Ellis. Ellis is a writer that I tend to like and is the creator/writer of one of my favorite series: Planetary. However, I never read RED, so I really had no idea of what it was about other than what I saw in the trailer for the movie. It was a movie I really wanted to go see in the theater, but... well... last year was full of chaos which included, during the summer while RED was in theaters, our van, nearly literally, blowing up (while I was inside it, no less), so I never did make it into the theater to see it. That turns out to be (mostly) okay. There are a few scenes that would have been great to see on the big screen, especially the scene where Moses steps out of the police car (but, of course, at the theater we couldn't have immediately rewound that one and watched it, again, as my wife demanded we do), but, overall, it isn't the sort of movie that loses its impact in translation to the television screen since the movie is about the characters, not about the action.The central character, Frank Moses, is played by Bruce Willis. This is just Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis, but, when you need an actor to play the part of Bruce, there is no one else that can do that, and he is great in this role. It would not surprise me if Willis was in Ellis' head as he wrote the character, although that is pure speculation on my part. At any rate, Bruce is completely enjoyable in his role as Frank Moses, and I can't really imagine anyone else doing the role the justice that Bruce gave it.Mary-Louise Parker plays the love interest, Sarah Ross. I've never been a big Mary-Louise Parker fan and never thought her memorable in any of the roles I've seen her in. In fact, I have to look to see what I actually have seen her in, so little impact she has had on me. I mean, I know she's the lead in Weeds, but I've never seen that and don't have any immediate plans to do so. However, she was perfectly delightful in  this role. She really brought just the right mixture of naivete, awe, and enthusiasm to the part. I'm not saying that there's not another actress that could have played that role, but she did a great job in it, and I can't think of anyone, off the top of my head, that could have done it better.Then there's Morgan Freeman. Freeman is another that is hired just to play himself, and, again, there is no one else that can play Morgan Freeman better. This is not to say that Freeman is incapable of a greater range than just playing himself; we've seen him in more than enough features to see that Freeman can play, pretty much, anything that is asked of him, but, when you need the, mostly, compassionate (grand)fatherly figure, there's probably no one better than Freeman, so he excels in his role. I can't say more than that without giving away pieces of the plot that you don't want to know about if you haven't seen  the movie.Freeman's counterpart is played by Helen Mirren, and she's no less than awesome. I believe that Helen Mirren can do pretty much anything, and I don't think she's ever hired to just ""be herself."" I don't even know what that would mean as I don't think I've ever seen her do anything that had just become cliche for her. Certainly, I've never seen her behind a machine gun before, so that was pretty incredible and probably worth the whole movie. However, her role is really summed up in her comment to Sarah, ""I kill people, Dear,"" just as if she was saying ""I made some cookies."" She was just perfect.And that brings us to John Malkovich. Malkovich is like crab to me, and I don't mean that in a good way. I spent years and years eating crab because I felt like I ought to like it, but, every time I did, I came away from it with the thought, ""I just don't like it."" But I would try it, again, the next time because I felt likt I just ought to like it. Really, I did that for years before I finally decided, ""you know, I really just don't like crab"" and gave up on it for good. That is my experience with Malkovich. Any time he was in something, I would go into it with the thought that I ought to like it because it was John Malkovich, but I always came away just not liking the experience, most notably in Jonah Hex, which was just dreadful, I think, mostly, due to how horrible Malkovich was. There are a few notable exceptions, I suppose, such as Being John Malkovich, but he's not an actor I generally enjoy, mostly due to the fact that he's really just always the same in every role he's in. However, he was brilliant in RED! I'm not sure there is anyone else that could have pulled off this role and been believable in it. To some extent, he played the role the way he always is, but, it was like he turned his perfomance, this time, up to 11, and that's exactly what this called for.The cast of villains, however, is somewhat divided. Richard Dreyfuss is amazing, as always, but Rebecca Pidgeon could have been replaced by anyone. Sure, the role wasn't written to stand out, but she did nothing to really make it her own, either. Karl Urban, on the other hand, was great. Hunky, pretty boy assassin. His complete seriousness in the role gave it the gravity and believability it needed, and he was pretty perfect opposite Bruce Willis. Besides, my wife says he's hot, although he needs to smile more. According to her. The last player for the villains is Julian McMahon. Although, I really enjoyed him as Dr. Doom in Fantastic Four; he is completely forgettable in his role as the vice president in RED and, probably, could have been replaced by just about anyone walking down the street.I didn't get enough Ernest Borgnine. He's impossible not to love, and it's a great, albeit small, perfect role for him.My immediate response to the movie was ""I'm going to have to buy this one."" And I will. My second response was, ""The kids will love this,"" and they did. I'm not really saying it's a family movie, but it certainly is a great movie for my family. My younger son asked me if they were going to make a prequel for it. heh Interestingly enough, they did do some prequel comics to coincide with the release of the movie. I haven't read those, either, though. Unfortunately, although the movie did make money, it wasn't the blockbuster they'd hoped it would be, so it's unlikely that there will be anything further. I guess I'm okay with that. I think it does help illustrate, however, that, as a culture, our current love is for super heroes, not comic books in general. I think Hollywood is kind of stuck on the idea that anything translated from comics will be a hit, but even a wonderful movie like RED underperformed due to its lack of capes and tights, as the cliche goes.If you're looking for a fun action/comedy, you should check RED out.",5,Willis as Willis,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,6769,"['comic', 'movie', 'based', 'was', 'written', 'Warren', 'Ellis',

Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.----------------------------------------Fun fact before I begin.  Brian Cox, who is in this 'Red' I'm reviewing is also in another film entitled 'Red'.  The later 'Red' is about a man whose only friend in the world is killed by some punk kids.  His only friend is his dog.  Afterward things escalate for everyone, and Cox's character finds himself taking justice into his own hands.  I've never seen it, but it did well, (as far as renting goes).  People who rented it seemed to like it.  I plan on watching it sometime in the future.  Anyway...This CIA infused 'Red' is quite a fun ride.  This was definitely a side project for all the actors involved, but they give it 100 percent, and it shows.  This movie delivers an all star cast involving:  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, the previously mentioned Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, Karl Urban, Mary-Louise Parker and others.This title came out a few years ago but is still an enjoyable film to watch.***Movie/Plot Details, Some Spoilers Ahead***The premise is simple, R.E.D. stands for ""Retired, Extremely, Dangerous.""  This cast of ex-killers are exactly that.  They may be up in years a little, but their skills are far from rusty.  The film first centers in on Bruce Willis's character, Frank Moses, a former CIA asset who is having a hard time adjusting to normal un-exciting civilian life.  He has no friends, no hobbies, and the only joy he has is ripping up his government paychecks so he has an excuse to call Mary-Louise Parker at the human resources department.  It's sad really.Well, things heat up rather quick for Frank Moses, he is assaulted in his very own house by a killing squad one night.  After dispatching them all, this is Bruce Willis we're talking about, he goes on the road, kidnaps ...Parker and gets his old band of killing buddies back together to try and figure out why they are all getting marked for death after all these years.There is an uneasyness between all the cast, every time they come face to face they always ask the same question, ""Are you here to kill me?""  They may be formal work mates but they are killers after all, and there can only be so much trust I guess.Malkovich's character is by far the funniest in the movie.  He's your classic paranoid loner type.  The funny part is, his paranoias are actually true.Morgan Freeman's screen time is not enough in my opinion, but the little he has is good.  Mirren and Brian Cox round out the team and we the viewers are left with a collection of actors that really work well together and deliver a good movie.Oh...by the way Karl Urban is in the film.  He's the younger CIA wet work asset who is after Bruce Willis and the others.  Good fight scene between him and Willis.---To Sum Up---Great, funny, and action packed film.

The movie opens with Willis getting up as the clock turns to 6:00 AM with no alarm. This quick opening scene shows us his orderly life. He rips up his retirement checks just so he can talk to a woman in Kansas City on the phone, whom he has not met, but has a fascination. Played by Marie-Louise Parker she also writes bad spy romances which Willis reads. As Willis gets up too early, his sixth sense is working, a group of men attempt to kill him. He heads to KC and kidnaps his would-be gf. As it turns out the CIA is trying to kill him for something that happened in Guatemala in 1981. The bulk of the movie is to figure out why and to stop it before they get killed.The dialouge has a dry wit to it. For example when Willis takes a bullet:Parker: ""This is bad.""Willis: ""People get shot all the time.""Parker: ""No they don't. They normally get paper cuts.""Malkovich: ""I normally get shot.""The film moves at a good pace and really gets fun when Malkovich shows up. John was a former CIA operative who was given LSD everyday for 11 years. He is quirky and paranoid.Ernest Borgnine: Plays a CIA records keeper.Karl Urban: CIA agent hunting Willis.Morgan Freeman: Former CIA agent, part of Willis' group.Helen Mirren: Also a former ""wet"" agent. Retired and complex. She enjoys baking, arranging flowers, and killing.Richard Dreyfuss shows up near the end as a bad guy arms dealer.As in most modern action films, impossible things happen.

There is nothing bland about this cast, not even in the love department.  High marks there.)  He's a retired CIA operative who discovers  that someone is trying to kill him.

1358511,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003Q6D2B4,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","There are two things you should know before watching ""Red."" The action-packed film is nominated for Golden Globe best picture for comedy/musical category (and this is not definitely a musical). The other thing is that the action comedy has great players including four Oscar winners (Ernest Borgnine, Richard Dreyfuss, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren). With this stellar cast, things just can't go wrong.The story itself, loosely based on the graphic novel created by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, is not original. A retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), now living alone, is suddenly attacked by a heavily armed hit squad. To survive and uncover who is pulling the strings, Frank goes to New Orleans, tracking down the clues while being chased by the current CIA agent William Cooper (Karl Urban) bent on killing him.Bruce Willis is fine as the retired agent who hasn't lost his touch, but it is Mary-Louise Parker as Sarah, an unsuspecting customer service agent for Moses' pension (and possible love interest), and John Malkovich as Marvin Boggs, ex-spy and conspiracy theorist, who steal every scene they are in.

With all the knowledge of worl government secrets is it all about haning up your gear and moving on to a happy retirement? Apparently not in the film RED. Bruce Willis playes a retired agent who is suddenly a target for termination by the very people who employed him and they will stop at nothing to see him dead. Even if that means getting your butt kicked many times over by the guy you are instructed to kill.RED is an entertaining hysterical ride. The cast is awesome, getting some of the most well known drama/action stars of the past 25-30 years to fill the roles of government assigned assasins in their golden years is nothing short of brilliant. Morgan Freemen delivers priceless one liners, John Malkovich is flat out hysterical and Helen Mirren....well all I can say is holy bejezus! Of course I have to say the rest of the cast was great. Karl Urban is really showing us that he is a great actor post LOTR. He does exceptionally well in these comic book adaption films and now it has been announced he will be playing Judge Dredd in the much needed re-dux. Brian Cox and Mary-Louise Parker also did a great job, though I didn't expect anything less. Probably the biggest surprise was Richard Dryfus...just because I haven't seen him in a movie in like FOREVER!All and all, RED is a fun film based on a comic book.

Though not Oscar material it is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Where it is and it isn't exactly what you thought it would be it certainly doesn't hurt the movie at all. The big surprise is that the cell is all older actors and an actress not what one usually sees in youth driven Hollywood. That being said I found it to be a nice change of pace. (Just so you know, I am 46).The acting was very good with out being over done. The action was crisp...though I am sure some of you would think that it was violent, very violent. However, it is what you would expect in a movie like this. The humor works well and is in the places where you would expect it. Again it is not over done and you never get the feeling that they are playing for laughs. It is exactly how real life would unfold. You find yourself laughing because what is happening is actually funny and in a way you can relate to it. This movie does have a story and the story does make perfect sense, you just have to let it unfold and you are rewarded. Also this movie has an excellent cast,so much better than most movies and they all do a terrific job, so much so you are sorry when the movie ends.
