However, it is a good workout, especially for a light day.  However, the same moves are done over and over and over in the DVD.  I know some people dislike &#34;happy feet,&#34; and if they do, then avoid this.  Most of Ellen's DVDs are around 45 minutes, and because this one is at 30 minutes, I thought I would like it.  However, the repetition bored me. I thought that once I got through the warm-up, it would get better, and then I realized it's the same moves throughout the DVD.As always, the production values are great:  fun, upbeat music, good sound, good visuals, and nice set/studio.Ellen is her usual cheerful and upbeat self, and she's motivating.If you like Ellen and you are okay with repetition, you'll be okay with this.",3,"The workout is good, but the moves are repetitive",1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,869,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'really', 'Ellen', 'Barrett', 'DVDs', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'incredibly', 'repetitive', 'However', 'good', 'workout', 'especially', 'light', 'day', 'However', 'same', 'moves', 'are', 'done', 'DVD', 'know', 'people', 'dislike', '34', 'happy', 'feet', '34', 'do', 'then', 'avoid', 'Most', 'Ellen', 'DVDs', 'are', '45', 'minutes', 'one', '30', 'minutes', 'thought', 'would', 'like', 'However', 'repetition', 'bored', 'thought', 'once', 'got', 'warm-up', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'then', 'realized', 'same', 'moves', 'DVD.As', 'always', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'great', 'fun', 'upbeat', 'music', 'good', 'sound', 'good', 'visuals', 'nice', 'set/studio.Ellen', 'usual', 'cheerful', 'upbeat', 'self', 'motivating.If', 'Ellen', 'are', 'okay', 'repetition', ""'ll"", 'be', 'okay']",Ellen Barrett: Super Fast Body Blast
1635628,A2TSHT8NOB3JME,B00BM9FTKY,Heather M.,"[1, 1]","I was happy to see that Ellen was releasing a 30 minute all cardio DVD and that it was to be more fast paced than her other workouts. The last few I bought I returned because I did not or barely broke a sweat. I can honestly say that I broke a decent sweat from this workout. However, that did not happen until the third part of the series where you put all the moves together over and over again. I was happy that I broke a sweat and my heart rate did go up. However, again this is so repetitive that the more you do this workout the more aggravating it is. I have had enough ""Happy Feet"" from Barefoot Cardio. In this workout it feels like you spend half the time doing that, whether it is by itself, or in combination before another move. I don't know if I should keep this or send it back. I bought my copy from Total Fitness DVDs for about 14.95. I'm debating whether the decent sweat for a repetitive 30 minute DVD is worth it.",3,Very Repetitve,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,933,"['was', 'happy', 'see', 'Ellen', 'was', 'releasing', '30', 'minute', 'cardio', 'DVD', 'was', 'be', 'more', 'fast', 'paced', 'other', 'workouts', 'last', 'few', 'bought', 'returned', 'did', 'not', 'barely', 'broke', 'sweat', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'broke', 'decent', 'sweat', 'workout', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'third', 'part', 'series', 'where', 'put', 'moves', 'together', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'happy', 'broke', 'sweat', 'heart', 'rate', 'did', 'go', 'up', 'However', 'again', 'so', 'repetitive', 'more', 'do', 'workout', 'more', 'aggravating', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Barefoot', 'Cardio', 'workout', 'spend', 'time', 'doing', 'combination', 'move', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'should', 'keep', 'send', 'back', 'bought', 'copy', 'Total', 'Fitness', 'DVDs', 'about', '14.95', ""'m"", 'debating', 'decent', 'sweat', 'repetitive', '30', 'minute', 'DVD']",Ellen Barrett: Super Fast Body Blast

1635630,AVI7WGFMF7GAJ,B00BM9FTKY,"JessicaT ""Did you say: &#34;cake?&#34;""","[9, 10]","I have to admit, the first time I did this workout, I found myself a bit bored and looking at the time and thanking the lord it wasn't any longer than 30 minutes otherwise I'd be comatose.I couldn't quite put my finger on it. It's not Ellen, she's still a superb instructor. And sure, the music is different to the ones on her previous DVDs but it doesn't have that awful mournful chanting (or wailing?) on her other new offering, Sleek Sculpt Express.But I gave it another chance, because gosh darn it, I love Ellen's workouts - and she changed me from an ""I hate exercise"" and a ""Once a month is enough"" person to an ""I've worked out 5 days in a row, now I'm going to plan the workouts I'll do for the next 7 days!"" - now after the 2nd & 3rd time doing this workout, it has grown on me and I love the way the workout just flows from one move to another so well.Super Fast Body Blast is about 30 minutes of cardio and there's quite a bit of repetition of the moves (i.e rainbow lunges - arghh! - I am not a fan of this move as it's uncomfortable on my toes to twist from side to side, so I just perform standard lunges). When you have a short amount of time, the variety in the workout will be less but that's so you can work on/perfect the moves you've learned. The emphasis is always on good form and working out with control. Having both of these means you'll achieve better results.This DVD is great for when you have a limited amount of time to exercise. But my body doesn't feel like it has been blasted enough after this workout so I like to follow it up with Ellen's other new 30 minute offering (Sleek Sculpt Express).Super Fast Body Blast + Sleek Sculpt Express = Now that's what I call a body blast!

I do an Ellen video 3-4 times a week, so I'm in fairly good shape and I could tell after doing this video that it is a bit more challenging than most of her videos, likely due to the fact that she squeezes the work out into 30 minutes instead of her usual 40-45. I appreciate that, since I generally only do 30 minutes of any of Ellen's videos due to being time crunched. With this video I feel like I'm getting a good, complete workout in 30 minutes. It features Ellen's classic big, controlled movements, done a little quicker than most of her videos, that challenge your muscles and create cardio. It doesn't contain as much variety as most of her videos, but it moves quickly and I'm happy to add it to my collection. After doing this video for the first time, I woke up the next day with some soreness in my middle back, and butt area - it's been a very long time since an Ellen video made me sore!

I just finished this one for the first time, and I can't believe how sweaty I got in 30 minutes. Ellen makes sure you are always using muscle, not momentum.

The workout still seems to go by pretty quickly. And can you say glutes and obliques?  Fabulous. I have weight to lose but work out regularly, so I am in decent shape.
