876812,A35FC3DWA1M79H,B00075145S,Christopher,"[3, 5]","Well, this is a wild movie!  First it is weird because it features a muscular guy who owns a hair salon, but his clients seem to go there to get it on instead of wanting their hair done!  It is not an action film, but despite it's ""R"" rating, this film is on par with soft porn!The first thing that caught my eye on this one is Tayna Boyd (AKA Celeste from ""Days of our Lives"") is in this.  This is what attracted me to the film(yeah, I saw it every now and then).  I know that Tanya is one fine women today, and I was shocked to find out that she went back to the 1970's!  However, I was saddened by her role in this porno.  I doubt if any of the main players got more than $2,000 for their roles, but Tanya was more or less a porn actor before ""Days.""This film seems to be mainly about sexual encounters more than and plot.  Johnathan, the lead, makes house calls for hair only to be hit on by the clients two (clearly) teenage daughters!  They not only take off their bikini tops, but they take off the bottoms too, and you see it ALL!  These girls looked their ages, so I do not know how this got by!  Then the mother comes out and pushes the daughters away and disrobes and starts riding the guy and yes, you see it ALL!Then, 'thugs' come by and destroy the man's shop.  His receptionist (Boyd) advises Johnathan that she will leave and go back to her pimp to avoid further problems.  She leaves, then comes right back and starts taking her clothes off!  I always liked what Boyd was packing even today and I always wanted to see what she was workin with - but I had no idea that I would see ALL that she was workin with!  I see it quite a few times in this film!  In fact, she is more or less FULLY naked throughout the movie!Johnathan is taking a shower (right after his place is destroyed?) and then Boyd joins him for some soft porn shower scene with ALL being seen at times.  Then the next scene is of the two of them waking up nude.  Boyd gets up and you see it ALL, then Johnathan is lying there and you see it ALL!  This film is nothing but porn and I do not know how it is ""R"" rated instead of ""X.""  It is as if the director knew he had no plot so he just threw in a bounch of sex and strong nudity in the film to keep our attention from what otherwise is a piece of garbage movie.I won't give it all away(!), but later on Boyd goes back to the pimp and Johnathan is paid to stay away, which he does.  Boyd continues to show it ALL.  So sad what Hollywood did to black women in those blaxploitation days.  Then Johnathan goes away after attending a wild party (a nude party for no reason), then he meets Boyd again and acts as if he was in love with her.  We never got the idea that he loved her!  He had sex with other women while she listened ,so she knew it and he took the money with the quickness to back off.  Sounds like love?This is a wild movie and it is sad that people (Boyd) would go this far for what I am sure is a low paycheck.  Even if it were millions, it is a shame.  She has a sexy body and should have been a model instead.  Well, at least she has respectable work on ""Days"" even if the shows will never be repeated like movies.  For the sex scenes and wildness alone, you might as well check it out.  Not a classic film, but classic for the sex without an ""X"" rating.  It still shocks me that there are so many ho's in Hollywood that will do ANYTHING for a dollar.  If it's on the corner, on video, in a club or in a ""movie,"" it is still the same - prostitution.

Jonathan seems to jump in the sack with just about any woman that steps through the door, yet he comes across as rather bored with ""servicing"" these women.  This changes though when he develops feelings for his new receptionist, Brenda.  Ya see, Brenda's on the run from Mr. Wilson(no, not the guy from Dennis The Menace), who's obsessed with her and wants to keep her for his own.Mr. Wilson tracks her to the salon and tries to strongarm her back, but now he's got Mr. Jonathan to deal with.This is Black Shampoo!!  It's a fun blaxploitation romp from Greydon Clark, who as you all remember, brought us such fun flicks as Satan's Cheerleaders and Joysticks.  The first third or so of the film is dedicated to Jonathan's sexploits, then it's kind of a love story, then Jonathan gets to put the hurt on the mobster goons(and they really are goons here!).Since we don't deal with any real violence or action til the final act, some may find this a tad boring.  The beginning is kind of like a softcore Skinemax flick.  One disturbing scene has Jonathan accosted and nearly raped poolside by two girls who don't look a day over fifteen!  And to make a disturbing scene even more disturbing, Jonathan ends up having sex with the mother of the girls at the poolside with the girls watching from the pool!The final act is a hoot as we're treated to chainsaw carnage, vehicular manslaughter and curling iron sodomy.  Who can resist watching it now after knowing that?John Daniels is a memorable leading man, but the character seems like he's swallowed a handful of downers, even during the fight scenes.  Is that one cool cat or what?The tone is a bit tongue in cheek, but it's not really as funny as it tries to be, especially in a scene where the goons trash the salon.  It's obviously done in a way that's supposed to be comical, but it plays out kinda long winded and just kinda....odd.  There's another odd scene where Jonathan and Brenda are running through the woods trying to escape Mr. Wilson and his goons.  Brenda(I'm assuming)is tired and out of breath, but is making sounds like she's having sex.  It's strange.In the end, this is a fun piece of 70s blaxploitation, maybe a tad slow at times, but fans of the genre will know what they're getting into.",4,Can You Feel The Love?,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2396,"['Mr.', 'Jonathan', 'hair', 'salon', 'more', 'brothel', 'considering', 'women', 'lining', 'up', 'Jonathan', 'ahem', 'services', 'Jonathan', 'jump', 'sack', 'just', 'woman', 'door', 'rather', 'bored', 'servicing', 'women', 'changes', 'when', 'feelings', 'new', 'receptionist', 'Brenda', 'Ya', 'see', 'Brenda', 'run', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'not', 'guy', 'Dennis', 'Menace', 'who', 'obsessed', 'keep', 'own.Mr', 'Wilson', 'salon', 'tries', 'strongarm', 'back', 'now', 'got', 'Mr.', 'Jonathan', 'deal', 'with.This', 'Black', 'Shampoo', 'fun', 'blaxploitation', 'romp', 'Greydon', 'Clark', 'who', 'remember', 'brought', 'such', 'fun', 'flicks', 'Satan', 'Cheerleaders', 'Joysticks', 'first', 'third', 'so', 'film', 'dedicated', 'Jonathan', 'sexploits', 'then', 'kind', 'love', 'story', 'then', 'Jonathan', 'put', 'hurt', 'mobster', 'goons', 'really', 'are', 'goons', 'here', '.Since', 'do', ""n't"", 'deal', 'real', 'violence', 'action', 'final', 'act', 'may', 'find', 'tad', 'boring', 'beginning', 'kind', 'softcore', 'Skinemax', 'flick', 'One', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'Jonathan', 'accosted', 'nearly', 'raped', 'poolside', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'day', 'fifteen', 'make', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'Jonathan', 'up', 'having', 'sex', 'mother', 'girls', 'poolside', 'girls', 'watching', 'pool', 'final', 'act', 'hoot', ""'re"", 'treated', 'chainsaw', 'carnage', 'vehicular', 'manslaughter', 'curling', 'iron', 'sodomy', 'Who', 'can', 'resist', 'watching', 'now', 'knowing', 'John', 'Daniels', 'memorable', 'leading', 'man', 'character', 'swallowed', 'handful', 'downers', 'even', 'fight', 'scenes', 'one', 'cool', 'cat', 'what', 'tone', 'bit', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'not', 'really', 'as', 'funny', 'be', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'goons', 'trash', 'salon', 'obviously', 'done', 'way', 'supposed', 'be', 'comical', 'out', 'kinda', 'long', 'winded', 'just', 'kinda', '.odd', 'odd', 'scene', 'where', 'Jonathan', 'Brenda', 'are', 'running', 'woods', 'trying', 'escape', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'goons', 'Brenda', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'tired', 'breath', 'making', 'sounds', 'having', 'sex', 'end', 'fun', 'piece', '70s', 'blaxploitation', 'maybe', 'tad', 'slow', 'times', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting']",N/A
