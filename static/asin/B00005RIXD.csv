DBZ is much better suited to the series where it has more time to develop the characters and create tension.This movie seemed even more predictable than the other ones, but I think the main problem was the short length of the battles especially the one with Gohan on his way to deliver the Sensu beans and the final fight. Granted given the characters it makes sense that the battles weren't allowed to go on longer, but there wasn't enough tension built up throughout the movie.Concerning the soundtrack, how lame. The only time  the heavey metal or whatever ... it is worked was with the History of Trunks, the other times it's just been stupid.All that being said I don't even think I would consider an essential viewing for a DBZ fan like most of the other movies I would.",2,A little bet of a letdown.,1031011200,"09 3, 2002",2002,864,"['do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'very', 'well', 'suited', 'limited', 'running', 'time', 'movies', 'DBZ', 'much', 'better', 'suited', 'series', 'where', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'create', 'tension.This', 'movie', 'seemed', 'even', 'more', 'predictable', 'other', 'ones', 'think', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'short', 'length', 'battles', 'especially', 'one', 'Gohan', 'way', 'deliver', 'Sensu', 'beans', 'final', 'fight', 'Granted', 'given', 'characters', 'sense', 'battles', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'go', 'longer', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'tension', 'built', 'up', 'movie.Concerning', 'soundtrack', 'how', 'lame', 'only', 'time', 'heavey', 'metal', 'worked', 'was', 'History', 'Trunks', 'other', 'times', 'just', 'been', 'stupid.All', 'being', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'would', 'consider', 'essential', 'viewing', 'DBZ', 'fan', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'would']",N/A

679713,A2JWX63ECN7X3W,B00005RIXD,AMV Reviewer,"[0, 0]","There was only one word to describe this movie, Finally! we finally have that great DBZ movie good animation as well as an awesome kick-ass soundtrack and strong story. this time around it's your classic revenge story as Goku defeated Frieza now Frieza's brother cooler has taken notice of Goku and goes to Earth to make Goku suffer. so essentially in cooler's eyes ""you take something from me, i take everything from you"". now the reason the story is strong isn't because of the revenge factor because thats kinda of cliche but the obvious inclusion of Frieza's brother who is an iconic DBZ villain and his brother is even stronger. next would be the quality of animation, the animation quality was fairly good but it wasn't the best. even so it was better than previous DBZ movies and three scenes in particular that were far above average in animation quality and that was 1st: Goku's first Kamehameha attempt on cooler. 2nd: when Goku transforms into a super saiyan. 3rd: coolers death ball at the end. and the best thing in my opinion similar to ""Lord Slug"" was the heavy use of ballads and Rock n roll that fits Dragon Ball Z perfect. now the last thin i appreciate is disabling Goku to further strengthen the rolls of other characters.

679714,A3KRWU9KOJHN02,B00005RIXD,Craig Juan,"[11, 15]","I wasn't very pleased with the fourth DBZ movie, because of the flat out dry plot and Goku's so-called Super Saiyan transformation. When I heard that the fifth DBZ movie ""Cooler's Revenge"" is about to come to our shores, I already knew from the start that it would be even better than the four early DBZ movies, because I already seen movie clips of it and read countless reviews about it. Finally, I own one, and believe me, I wasn't disappointed at all. The DVD menus were great ! Better than the ones seen on ""The History of Trunks"" and ""Lord Slug"". When I selected the play option, I was introduced to a way better DBZ movie with better animation, deep plot, and amazing fighting scenes. The movie starts off when Bardcok and the rest of Planet Vegeta were destroyed by Frieza's death ball (as seen in Bardock: The Father of Goku). Frieza's older brother, Cooler and his armored squadron were watching Planet Vegeta explode into smitherines. While the ball was slowly falling on the planet, Cooler's squadron spotted a Saiyan pod with a baby Saiyan in it. It was Kakarot, soon to be named Goku ! The squadron was about to shoot it down, but Cooler stopped them and suggested that his brother should take care of it himself. Years after Frieza was killed by Goku's enormous powers, Cooler heard the news by Salza and the rest of his crew. Cooler didn't care about Frieza's death nor does he want to avenge his death, he just wants to get back at the man who stomped all over his family pride. And that man is none other than Goku. When Goku, Gohan, Oolong, Icarus, and Krillin go on a camping trip, they found themselves surrounded by Cooler's armored squadron. It's up to Goku to stop Frieza's brother, Cooler from causing destruction to Earth. Well, I can't spoil any surprises, but I can give you a few pointers on how this movie is like. First off, the plot is much, much, much deeper and much more interesting than that of ""Lord Slug"". The animation is even slicker and brighter than the other DBZ movies that I've ever seen. No other DBZ movie has ever looked this great. The voice acting still remains the same. Simply put...slightly weird, and pretty cool ! I really liked the English voice actor who played Cooler. It's a good thing they didn't use a woman's voice to play as him. The voice actor who played as Salza, sounds like a wannabe mexican gangster. That's what FUNimation always does. Every weird or cool looking character they see, they will give them a weird accent like a French, British, Scottish, or even a Mexican accent. That's just plain out stupid, but I have no problem with it. It's not really that much of a problem. If it continues to go out of control, I will get sick of it. But as of now, it's okay ! The most amazing aspect to this movie are the transformations. When Cooler goes to his final state of transformation, his body nearly resembles that of a samurai warrior without the swords and gadgets. And finally, Goku transforms into a real Super Saiyan. And no, the fourth movie wasn't the first to ever have the Super Saiyan feature. ""Cooler's Revenge"" is the first DBZ movie to ever have the Super Saiyan transformation scene, and Goku looks well animated when he transforms into a Super Saiyan. And as always, the action is definently eye catching, especially the part when Salza and Piccolo battle it out inside the tree area of the forest. It's like watching a samurai anime, only with flying techiniques and the use of special abilities. The ending was great. Although appearing to be a bit average, it's perfect. The only thing I hated about the movie was the Spanish version. I'm not saying that I'm racist towards Mexicans, but the opening and closing music they translated, sounded weird. That's pretty much it. So in conclusion of this review, this is the far by, the best DBZ movie ever created. If you're thinking about seeing DBZ in a whole new level, look no further than ""Cooler's Revenge"".",5,One of the best DBZ movies ever made !

679715,ADF2HP0TEQU8F,B00005RIXD,"David C. Rutledge ""Superpope""","[4, 7]","This has been one of my favorite DBZ stories since I first watched it over a decade ago.  The flow of the battles, timing, artistic composition, and scene direction are all fantastically done.  To watch this in the original Japanese is truly 45 minutes well spent, even if you can't understand a word of it.  I should know.  I've done just that more times than I can count.However, to watch the Funimation English dub of this film is like watching someone set fire to the Mona Lisa.  All of the dramatic silences, perfectly timed music, and short, to the point dialogues are scrapped in favor of constant babbling by nails-on-the-chalkboard irritating American voice actors and totally inappropriate pop music.  At times it seems that the English script is being made up as they go along!Luckily for us, you may watch this DVD in the original Japanese with directly translated subtitles to match.  It is only by this saving grace that I rate it a 5 star DVD.  However, if you'd like to conduct a small study in abysmal US translation, try watching it in English with the Japanese version subtitles on-screen.  You'll hear Cooler say, ""I wanna just blow this planet up, and I will"", but see on-screen that he actually said, ""It would be easy to destroy this planet, but my pride will not allow it.""  You'll read that Karin scolds Gohan for not climbing up from the bottom of his tower, but hear Gohan appologize for not bringing a gift!  And possibly worst of all, you'll hear characters spout endless, nonsensical trash-talk about how much pain they're going to inflict, while in the original Japanese they just stood calmly, staring each other down with confidence.It's amazing how arrogant we Americans can be.  Does Funimation actually think they are IMPROVING on the original by lazily throwing in bad pop music and idiotic jokes, and changing key story elements for no reason?  Please, Funimation.

Very nice.The English version features hard rock music by various artists like Disturbed and Deftones. Given the choice between FUNimation TV dub music and the rock music, the choice is obvious. I think it fits the action pretty well. For those of you who dislike the English version, the inclusion of the Japanese dub AND Spanish dub will more than tide you over to buy this title.Overall, Cooler's Revenge is pretty much the best 45 minutes movie you will ever see.

Cooler, brother to psychotic supervillain Freezer (yes, all of Toriyama-sensei's names are like that) comes to challenge the upstart &quot;monkey&quot; (as his people call Saiyajin) who defeated his little brother.Cooler is, well, cooler than his brother was. He sounds the same and looks quite similar, but he's MUCH tougher and meaner. He saw Goku's capsule escape the destruction of Vegita-sei at Freezer's hands years ago, but didn't intercept, saying it was Freezer's own problem. Cooler clearly outmatches Goku on every level, but won't kill him immediately because he knows that what he's seeing isn't what could defeat his brother. He insists on seeing the Super-Saiyajin transformation, and will push Goku until he gets it. Which, of course, he does.This makes an excellent double-bill with &quot;Return of Cooler&quot; (Japanese title translates more to &quot;Attack of a Billion Power Warriors&quot; or something of that nature), where Cooler gets a return match.",4,Be careful what you wish for.

Highlights include Gohan's meeting with Karin and Yajirobe, Goku taking out Cooler's personal Ginyu team, and a certain green-skinned guest star who makes an appearance.Still, I must confess I can't stand the marketing behind these movies. I originally thought the first three movies had been released with their original box art and titles, but I was informed that this was not the case. However, that doesn't change the fact that ""Cooler's Revenge"" is still a stupid title. Cooler shows up again in Movie #6, so what are they gonna call that? ""The Revenge of Cooler's Revenge""?

Along the line of short side episode style films as Lord Slug, History of Trunks, and Bardock Father of Goku, this title packs a enough action to last through somethinmg Like Garlic Junior or Cell in the short time period of at most 2 episodes.The story takes palce after we meet Trunks, during the three year intermission before the Androids or Cell show up.  Coller finds out a Saiyin killed Freiza, although not at to much of a loss he feels that his Families Honor has been ruined by this travesty.  He then journeys to Earth with his own Ginyu FOrce style group and decides to take out Goku (although he doesn't know who killed Freiza).  From there the action doesn't stop as Goku, Gohan, Krillion, and Piccolo fight to stop Cooler from his revenge.For the most part I like this and gave it 5 stars because I am a preety solid DBZ fan and am dedicated to it to a certain extent.

679730,AI5H6KPVN6W7A,B00005RIXD,"""war_of_the_4""","[0, 2]","This was the first DBZ movie I ever saw.  And coming off of the TV anime which was way too drawn out (at least until the Cell Games) this short 45 minute movie was graetly appreciated.  It starts off with an explaination of who this Cooler guy is and how he ties into the series (even though he's exclusive to the movies).  He is the elder brother of Freiza (yes, that will he just dia and go away? Freiza) and is much stronger than his little bro.  He comes to earth to maintain his family's honor (not to avenge his brother) which is a very Japanese concept I guess.  The fight really starts off about halfway through the movie and keeps heating up til the very end, especially once Coller powers up to a level surpasing his brother's (heh heh heh).  I watched the movie in Japanese and English.  I do like the Japanese voices better, but the music is all recycled from the series.  The English voices are ok, but the rock music really makes the fights feel more intense.  This is the 5th of 13 DBZ movies.  FUNimation really needs to get crackin on the rest of the movies (they've released the first 8 so far).  Also, the reason that the highest mark I can give to a DBZ movie is 4 stars is that none of them are widescreen in the US releases.  These were released in the theaters in Japan, thus they ARE supposed to be widescreen (matted format 1.85:1 ratio I believe, TV screens are 1.33:1).  There are scenes in the movies that look chopped off at the sides on the DVDs.  This is why.  All in all, it's a good bye for a DVD fan.
