But what really stood out is i personally love the comedy in the series. The one thing i do have to complain about is that the anime only goes to just over half of the manga leaving a lot of  the story out but the anime and manga both have a happy ending so its not so bad.",5,Great Series,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,409,"['just', 'finished', 'show', 'i', 'think', 'great', 'romance', 'anime', 'character', 'development', 'how', 'would', 'expect', 'romance', 'anime', 'what', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'i', 'personally', 'love', 'comedy', 'series', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'do', 'have', 'complain', 'about', 'anime', 'only', 'just', 'half', 'manga', 'leaving', 'lot', 'story', 'anime', 'manga', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'so', 'not', 'so', 'bad']",N/A
1569692,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B008KZX7MK,"Hope this helps ""help""","[17, 17]","I randomly came across this show one day while just browsing.  First thing I thought was ""pass"".  I'm not too fond of anime (or any shows for that matter) that makes perversion a point of entertainment.  Especially with the way that some aspects of the box cover is portrayed, it tries to sell it as ""that kind of show"".  But then I read the premise, and that's what caught my attention.  By the end, the way the box sold it was very misleading to what it actually was:  A funny, serious, but classy romantic drama.  The whole series centers around a high school part timer who works at a maid cafe.  Not a lot of shows focus on that, and I figured I'll give a few episodes a spin...I could learn something about that aspect of pop culture.  In the end, I finished it and was surprised at how deep it was...and how clean and not-fanservicey it was.CONTENT NOTES FOR PARENTS:Before moving on, it's only fair to discuss content things to be aware of...especially for parents.  Contrary to other shows that use the ""maid motif"", there wasn't any fanservice or anything of the sort.  In fact, even though the dresses looked cute and beautiful, they were very conservative in length and not revealing at all.  No gravure type shots, no suggestive close-ups.  Even the beach scene was just them having a good time frolicking in normal beach attire (and with some good character development I might add)...the creators didn't ""exploit"" the situation at all.  The language was quite tame as well.  There are only 3 points of possible contention and controversy.  THE FIRST, is that their is a middle school boy who likes to cross-dress from time to time (ok, a lot).  His reason, though, is because he particularly likes cute and frilly things, and he does have crushes on women...especially Misaki (strongly suggested in the anime...confirmed on the manga).  THE 2ND, is that the main male lead (who is completely straight) kisses another guy (who is also straight...but very timid) in one episode.  That was meant partly as a joke and a way to give the girl he is really fond of some peace of mind (He had kissed her prior...and she's really dense because she was confused about what he meant when he kissed her - to the point that she could not get work done...you kind of have to see the episode to understand the context...it makes a bit more sense).  THE 3RD, is also a running gag in the series.  One of the male characters, who is quite timid and afraid, is trying to become more manly and strong but keeps winding up in situations where he is forced dress like a girl (ie.  raffle costume contest where costumes remained unknown until open, a guy couldn't find anyone else to pretend to be his girlfriend...so he asked that guy to pretend, and 1 or 2 more similar type instances).  Apart from those three things, this show is amazingly clean with good life lessons.MOVING ONFirst off, let me say that this show is based off of a still ongoing manga.  But fortunately, the anime does tie up nicely in the end and feels complete.  The show itself, has many beautiful and wonderful aspects to it.  One is a beautiful exploration on various philosophies and ideas that appear in the maid/butler cafe type culture.  It was very interesting to see that industry have a focus in the show.  Not only that, but they treat the maid cafe in more of a natural light with a desire, it seems, to give it a more honest portrayal.  Not only that, but the maids, themselves, you learn to see as normal people with their own normal concerns and a strong sense of camaraderie...not just some closet/shameful job as is often assumed.  It's really amazing the things they go through, the patience they must have, and the lengths they would go to maintain the atmosphere for the guests.  And finally, how aspects and principles of ""the maid cafe"" can be used in a practical sense in life.The other beautiful aspect is how they weaved the character's backstories and lives around this and the depth that most of these characters have.  Even some of the minor characters that you would see for 3 episodes total were folks you could sympathize with.  And shall I add that one of the main ""villains"" was kinda likable by the end.  What helped this was the depth that the characters had.  Even many minor characters had small flashbacks that helped build even a small connection.  What's more, the interaction and relationships between the characters was very charming and believable.The last big point I found wonderful about this series is how they interwove life lessons by ""showing"", not ""telling"".  Throughout the series, you were engaged in situations that were not only naturally executed, but we could all relate to.  And just seeing how many of these characters dealt with their circumstances was often encouraging and heartwarming, at least.PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):This is where I'll discuss how well I think the narrative progressed.  All in all, I think the pacing was actually perfect.  They moved forward at a decent pace that allowed you to ""explore"" and ""look around a bit""...while stopping at the right moments where we would want to take pause and soak it in.  For the most part, the episodes are stand-alone, but past events and characters to do return throughout and are never forgotten.  There isn't an earnest sense of plot progression similar to a ""we-have-to-journey-to-kill-the-darklord"" type of show.  But that's just it...the journey, for the anime anyways, is the evolution of the two leads towards each other and inside themselves.  There are some big minor plot points too keep things spiced up and interesting, though.  But in the end, you are basically watching the days in the lives of the two main leads...and at times the lives of the supporting cast.  I am more of an ""end-goal"" type person in stories...but this really worked for me and I had many laughs, ""awwwws"", and heart wrenching moments.  The end also ties up nicely.  The Manga is on-going...but if I didn't know that this was based off a manga, I would have thought the story was complete.ALL IN ALL:This is a charming show about maid cafe culture...but also about living day by day and discovering new things about yourself and others.  It is also a show about letting go of past regrets and balance.  Don't go into this thinking this is a ""pervy"" type show.  You'd be terribly mistaken and left very wanting (if that really was your kind of thing).  Just like a true maid, it carries elegance, grace, and determination...while staying classy.",4,"Elegance, Grace, and Class: a show that takes a turn away from the expected...while amazingly staying

The story follows Misaki, a student at a high-school that has recently been changed from an ""all male"" school to a co-ed school. Therefore the number of female students at the high-school is low. Misaki takes it upon herself to defend those few female students and to make the environment comfortable for them, hence she becomes the president of the student council.After school Misaki secretly works at a cafe called ""Maid Latte"" where all the waitresses dress like maids. Misaki has to work because her family (mother and younger sister) are really poor.Enter Usui, a mysterious and handsome guy in the school who discovers Misaki's secret (that she works as a maid after school), and who starts teasing her and hanging around her all the time after that. Even though Misaki complains about his presence constantly, yet Usui always protects Misaki and comes to her aid. Misaki slowly learns that she can't do it all on her own. And Usui, in his way, slowly chips away at Misaki's defenses making her fall in love with him.Favorite funny line:Usui: Who do you think I am?Misaki: A mysterious perverted alien from the planet pheromones.The only drawback for this series is that it can get a bit slow, there are two filler episodes that can be completely skipped without missing anything.In the end if you're in the mood for a good romance/comedy, then Maid Sama is it.",4,Funny and Romantic,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,1464,"['review', 'anime', 'not', 'dvd', 'set', 'Maid', 'Sama', 'cute', 'funny', 'romantic', 'anime', 'story', 'Misaki', 'student', 'high-school', 'recently', 'been', 'changed', 'male', 'school', 'co-ed', 'school', 'number', 'female', 'students', 'high-school', 'low', 'Misaki', 'defend', 'few', 'female', 'students', 'make', 'environment', 'comfortable', 'hence', 'president', 'student', 'council.After', 'school', 'Misaki', 'secretly', 'cafe', 'called', 'Maid', 'Latte', 'where', 'waitresses', 'dress', 'maids', 'Misaki', 'work', 'family', 'mother', 'younger', 'sister', 'are', 'really', 'poor.Enter', 'Usui', 'mysterious', 'handsome', 'guy', 'school', 'who', 'Misaki', 'secret', 'maid', 'school', 'who', 'teasing', 'hanging', 'time', 'Even', 'Misaki', 'presence', 'constantly', 'yet', 'Usui', 'always', 'Misaki', 'aid', 'Misaki', 'slowly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'own', 'Usui', 'way', 'slowly', 'chips', 'away', 'Misaki', 'defenses', 'making', 'fall', 'love', 'him.Favorite', 'funny', 'line', 'Usui', 'Who', 'do', 'think', 'am', 'Misaki', 'mysterious', 'perverted', 'alien', 'planet', 'pheromones.The', 'only', 'drawback', 'series', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'slow', 'are', 'two', 'filler', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'completely', 'skipped', 'missing', 'end', ""'re"", 'mood', 'good', 'romance/comedy', 'then', 'Maid', 'Sama']",N/A
