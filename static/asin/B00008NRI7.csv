745630,AXJTNYD3UK1BP,B00008NRI7,"1smileycat ""1smileycat""","[0, 0]","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I'm a Bullock fan and (sort-of) a Grant fan, the combination was wonderful! Bullock plays a lawyer who works for legal aid doing ""good"" by protesting the destruction of anything with any sort of importance to someone.  Grant plays the playboy in charge of a company who plans to knock down most of the things that Bullock is trying to save.  By a twist of fate, she ends up his lawyer.  This way she can be sure he uses his millions to do good.The chemistry plays out brilliantly - and naturally.  When Bullock decides she cannot bear to work for him any longer and gives her 2 week (more like 2 month) notice, he informs every potential employer that he can't do with out her.  She agrees to find her replacement for him- who ends up being a pretty, sexy red head looking to bed the boss!  This finally makes Grant & Bullock realize they have feelings for each other.Grant's witt and humor are all over this movie and combining him with Bullock's charm makes this a winner!  The traffic jam scene will crack up any audience!

745631,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00008NRI7,A Customer,"[0, 0]","Summary:Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) is a Harvard educated lawyer who, instead of chasing big money, is interested in stopping big money (especially Wade Industries) from wreaking havoc on decrepit architectural masterpieces.  When George Wade (Hugh Grant), part owner of Wade Industries or Development or something like that, loses another beautiful but incompetent lawyer after having hired her simply to sleep with her, he hits upon the idea of hiring Lucy when she approaches him about saving a building that his company is planning on destroying.  Lucy agrees to be hired but only because she is 'convinced' that if she actually is working for the people that have all of the money that she will be able to do more good than by just fighting them.Once on board Lucy and George develop a strange but humorous (for the audience anyway) relationship, but it is remarkably taxing on Lucy who eventually decides that it is just too much.  She finally convinces George to let her go, but when her replacement, June Carter (Alicia Witt), comes aboard the romantic relationship that had been developing between George and Lucy but had not been verbalized comes to a head.  On top of this, George is being pressured by his brother, Howard Wade (David Haig), who is the real brains behind the company, to destroy the building they had originally promised not to destroy in agreement for Lucy coming to work with them.  Now George and Lucy must wrestle with their morals and their emotions to decide the best course of action.My Comments:Is it wrong for a man to enjoy Hugh Grant's performances?  I mean, there is no romantic attraction, I just think the guy has good comedic presentation.  Sandra Bullock on the other hand, well, she wasn't horrible in this, but it wouldn't have been a comedy if it weren't for Hugh Grant.  He is funny.  And the writer's of the movie do a great job of giving him good material to work with.The story is pretty much a typical romantic comedy recipe, but it does have some memorable moments, for instance, at one point George and Lucy chase down a motor home in rush hour traffic so Lucy can use the toilet - can't recall that ever being done before (and it probably won't be done again).  The rest of the cast, well, yes, there are some other people, but they play such remarkably insignificant roles that they aren't really even worth mentioning.  The movie knows what its strong points are - Grant and Bullock - and screen time is about 99.9% them.Overall, if you enjoy Hugh Grant's sense of humor, this is just as good as, say, Notting Hill or About a Boy (though I'm sure people would argue that Sandra Bullock doesn't compare to Julia Roberts but I don't know that it matters because in both cases Hugh Grant is the funny one, not the female actresses).  I would definitely recommend this as a date movie or for fans of Hugh Grant.",3,Surprisingly funny.

745632,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B00008NRI7,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[1, 1]","Two Weeks Notice starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant is a cute and safe romantic comedy. There are some funny scenes in this film but of course the chemistry is awkwardly steamy. Grant always seems lazy in the love department, his chemistry with Drew Barrymore in Music and Lyrics is on the breezy side as well. Bullock's appeal saves this film, the scenes where she is ordering gallons and gallons of chinese food is a riot. This film is an office romance so it does have some orginality to it but otherwise it's pretty much a standard love story. Two Weeks Notice is worth a notice or two though.

I did enjoy it, and found myself cracking up.Good points: Along with all the character flaws both Wade and Kelson have, the film is careful to develop redeemable character traits along the way as well, making both characters human rather than unsalvageably neurotic. Very human in-fact, I know people in real life like these two. They're also careful to show that both characters do actually have similar interests in life so it's not completely head-scratching to see them falling for each other. Oh and the romance is never sappy, so for those who are a fan of subtle expressions, furtive glances and baffled reactions, this is the film for you. Bullock and Grant might be playing their usual roles but those roles are definitely very compatible, at least in this film. Chemistry is present and makes the film work.So by all means go out and buy this film.

745637,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00008NRI7,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","Take an actor that's good at playing the self centered womanizer; take an actress who's good at playing the lonely tomboy; give them a script that utilizes their strengths and pairs it with witty and fresh dialog and what do you have?  I'll tell you what you have; you have one extremely funny, and rewarding, cinematic experience.  `Two Weeks Notice' does just that.  It pairs the very `British' Hugh Grant with everyone's favorite `train wreck' Sandra Bullock and it allows the two of them to play off one another brilliantly.Sandra Bullock has been quoted as saying that she is in no hurry to film another romantic comedy because she has already filmed the perfect one; `Two Weeks Notice'.  I have to agree (although I thought `While You Were Sleeping' was equally `perfect') for this film is hilarious from start to finish.The film follows Lucy Kelson, a lawyer who makes it a practice of fighting against large corporations who are bent on tearing down the community to make profit.  One such corporation is Wade Industries.  When she accosts Wade's posterboy George Wade she finds herself being offered a job.  If she takes the job then her precious community center will be spared.  She agrees and thus starts the crazy relationship between employer and employee.  Lucy soon discovers that working for George is a fulltime job; as in 24-7.  When Lucy decides she has had enough she gives George her two-week notice; but quitting Wade proves to be more difficult then Lucy expected.Like I mentioned, Sandra and Hugh play off one another magnificently.  Their humor matches the other beautifully and lends itself to some magical comedic moments.  This is one of those pairings that makes complete and total sense; one you wish they would revisit very soon.  While Lucy and George are nothing new to Bullock and Grant respectively, the characters seem fresh because they finally have a worthy partner.  Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock compliment one another; they complete one another.The film also has some worthy supporting characters.  Dana Ivey and Robert Klein play Lucy's parents Ruth and Larry and play off one another wonderfully as well.  Larry is the concerned and affectionate confidant while Ruth is the challenging opinionated mother who sets expectations for her daughter to reach.  Heather Burns (who also stars alongside Bullock in the two `Miss Congeniality' films) plays Lucy's best friend Meryl and while she's not as memorable as she was in `Miss Congeniality' (that may be due to considerably less screen time) she still does a fine job.  Stealing the supporting brownie points is Alicia Witt (when is this girl going to get a gig that really emphasizes her talent?!?!) who just mesmerizes as June Carver, the lucky hopeful training to take over Lucy's job.In the end I must say once again that `Two Weeks Notice' is hysterical.  Sure, it is clich&eacute;d (but never to a fault) and it is predictable (but in a good way) but it is so genuinely charming and so well constructed that you can't help but enjoy it to the very last drop.  Bullock and Grant soar together.  Here's to hoping they team up for a sequel (or at least another film).",5,`Two Weeks' takes two great actors and creates one great movie...,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,3162,"['Take', 'actor', 'good', 'playing', 'self', 'centered', 'womanizer', 'take', 'actress', 'who', 'good', 'playing', 'lonely', 'tomboy', 'give', 'script', 'strengths', 'pairs', 'witty', 'fresh', 'dialog', 'what', 'do', 'have', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'what', 'have', 'have', 'one', 'extremely', 'funny', 'rewarding', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'just', 'very', 'British', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'train', 'wreck', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'two', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'brilliantly.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'been', 'quoted', 'saying', 'hurry', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'already', 'filmed', 'perfect', 'one', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'have', 'agree', 'thought', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'was', 'equally', 'perfect', 'film', 'hilarious', 'start', 'finish.The', 'film', 'Lucy', 'Kelson', 'lawyer', 'who', 'practice', 'fighting', 'large', 'corporations', 'who', 'are', 'bent', 'tearing', 'down', 'community', 'make', 'profit', 'One', 'such', 'corporation', 'Wade', 'Industries', 'When', 'Wade', 'posterboy', 'George', 'Wade', 'being', 'offered', 'job', 'job', 'then', 'precious', 'community', 'center', 'will', 'be', 'spared', 'thus', 'crazy', 'relationship', 'employer', 'employee', 'Lucy', 'soon', 'working', 'George', 'fulltime', 'job', '24-7', 'When', 'Lucy', 'had', 'George', 'two-week', 'notice', 'quitting', 'Wade', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'then', 'Lucy', 'mentioned', 'Sandra', 'Hugh', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'magnificently', 'humor', 'other', 'beautifully', 'magical', 'comedic', 'moments', 'one', 'pairings', 'complete', 'total', 'sense', 'one', 'wish', 'would', 'revisit', 'very', 'soon', 'Lucy', 'George', 'are', 'nothing', 'new', 'Bullock', 'Grant', 'respectively', 'characters', 'seem', 'fresh', 'finally', 'have', 'worthy', 'partner', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'compliment', 'one', 'complete', 'one', 'another.The', 'film', 'also', 'worthy', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Dana', 'Ivey', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'play', 'Lucy', 'parents', 'Ruth', 'Larry', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'wonderfully', 'as', 'well', 'Larry', 'concerned', 'affectionate', 'confidant', 'Ruth', 'challenging', 'opinionated', 'mother', 'who', 'expectations', 'daughter', 'reach', 'Heather', 'Burns', 'who', 'also', 'alongside', 'Bullock', 'two', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'films', 'Lucy', 'best', 'friend', 'Meryl', 'not', 'as', 'memorable', 'was', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'considerably', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'still', 'fine', 'job', 'Stealing', 'supporting', 'brownie', 'points', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'when', 'girl', 'going', 'get', 'gig', 'really', 'talent', 'who', 'just', 'June', 'Carver', 'lucky', 'hopeful', 'training', 'take', 'over', 'Lucy', 'job.In', 'end', 'must', 'say', 'once', 'again', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'hysterical', 'Sure', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'never', 'fault', 'predictable', 'good', 'way', 'so', 'genuinely', 'charming', 'so', 'well', 'constructed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'very', 'last', 'drop', 'Bullock', 'Grant', 'soar', 'together', 'Here', 'hoping', 'team', 'up', 'sequel', 'least', 'film']",Two Weeks Notice

You know going in to the movie what to expect, for the two of them will battle yet fall in love. But I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I was going to, for the screenplay is given moments of true inspiration.Bullock plays Lucy, a liberal-minded activist lawyer, educated at Harvard, who gets tricked into believing that she'll help her humanitarian causes by becoming assistant to Grant's George, a self-centered mogul with money but no ethics. He mainly hires her so that he can, at first, compromise all of her beliefs while, at the same time, annoying his family, who don't like women lawyers for some unexplained reason.But, as they interact, George finds that all Lucy's quirks, difficulties and opinionated stances make her sorta charming and invaluable to him. He finds over time that he cannot make a decision without her, which leads her to give her resignation.So George has two weeks to make Lucy stay, and she has two weeks to determine whether she really wants to go ... or if she kind of likes being under someone's confidante.And that's when the actors' chemistry starts to work for them. The plot, though obviously formulaic, does manage SOME rare moments of ingenuity, particularly in the characterization of Lucy's brilliant, activist mother, played very well by veteran character actress Dana Ivey.It's not a gem of a movie, but it's not a complete dud. Still, after Grant's great work in ""About a Boy,"" it's a shame he had to do something so trite.",3,"Dumb fun, mostly, and the stars have chemistry.",1043107200,"01 21, 2003",2003,1594,"['Sandra', 'Bullock', 'still', 'got', 'cute', 'winning', 'screen', 'personality', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'charming-enough', 'scoundrel', 'know', 'going', 'movie', 'what', 'expect', 'two', 'will', 'battle', 'yet', 'fall', 'love', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'screenplay', 'given', 'moments', 'true', 'inspiration.Bullock', 'plays', 'Lucy', 'liberal-minded', 'activist', 'lawyer', 'educated', 'Harvard', 'who', 'tricked', 'believing', ""'ll"", 'help', 'humanitarian', 'causes', 'becoming', 'assistant', 'Grant', 'George', 'self-centered', 'mogul', 'money', 'ethics', 'mainly', 'so', 'can', 'first', 'compromise', 'beliefs', 'same', 'time', 'annoying', 'family', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'women', 'lawyers', 'unexplained', 'reason.But', 'interact', 'George', 'Lucy', 'quirks', 'difficulties', 'opinionated', 'stances', 'make', 'sorta', 'charming', 'invaluable', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'decision', 'give', 'resignation.So', 'George', 'two', 'weeks', 'make', 'Lucy', 'stay', 'two', 'weeks', 'determine', 'really', 'go', 'kind', 'likes', 'being', 'someone', 'confidante.And', 'when', 'actors', 'chemistry', 'work', 'plot', 'obviously', 'formulaic', 'manage', 'SOME', 'rare', 'moments', 'ingenuity', 'particularly', 'characterization', 'Lucy', 'brilliant', 'activist', 'mother', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'veteran', 'character', 'actress', 'Dana', 'Ivey.It', 'not', 'gem', 'movie', 'not', 'complete', 'dud', 'Still', 'Grant', 'great', 'work', 'Boy', 'shame', 'had', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'trite']",Two Weeks Notice

The problem is, 2 Weeks Notice isn't as original as either of those, but it still may be the more enjoyable of the three. Both Hugh Grant and Bullock have done these roles before and this script has definitely been done before.  Bullock plays a hard working lawyer who cares about the community and loves to protest the Wade corporation who is always tearing down some important building to put in a parking lot.  Ironically, Grant is sort of the CEO of WADE and Bullock ends up working for him and surprise...falling in love with him.  Another one of those girl falls for extremely selfish rich guy and rich guy gives it all up to prove he really loves her stories.  The love story is a little unconvincing and the plot is nothing new, but its a harmless romantic comedy that is far from the worst of the genre mostly due to some funny moments and decent performances from Bullock and Grant.  Actually, Bullock said in an interview that after this film she was going to slow down on the romantic comedy roles...good for her. Keep your eyes open for unsubtle cameo by Norah Jones.  It's like one of those music videos for a film soundtrack that intercut film clips with the artist performing only look!  There's Norah Jones right in the movie!

Later as she goes on working for him she gets fed up about the lack of attention and respect that she receives so she gives him her 2 weeks Notice. What happens after that is a budding romance between Bullock's and Grant's character that leads to pleasant and surprising twists and turns. At one point in the movie when Lucy gets frustrated she calls Wade ""the most selfish man on the planet""!

Here, she only has Two Weeks Notice, but the film is twice as funny in half the time. Hugh Grant is so charming that he was able to restart his career after he was caught with his pants down with Divine Brown. He made the Mea Culpa circuit on the talk shows, admitted his mistake with a boyish grin, and all was forgiven (though he probably still had a lot of 'splaining to do to his girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley). Anyway, oftentimes when I see a Hugh Grant or a Sandra Bullock film, I am very skeptical at first. Sometimes they are a bit much. But seeing them together, I bet that they would be fantastic. Each would balance out the other, or so I hoped.Thankfully, I wasn't wrong. As far as the Romantic Comedy genre goes, it doesn't get any better than this. Their characters are opposites that attract, like Sam and Diane on Cheers. Hugh is a business man / Real Estate developer--kind of a Donald Trump with better hair and a British accent (BTW, Trump does a cameo and a Trump home is used for one of the locations). Grant is George Wade, a classic conservative, while Sandra plays Lucy Kelson, a liberal lawyer given to defending the poor downtrodden, and as a result, she is pretty poor and downtrodden her own self.-----------------------------Meryl Brooks: Come on, I've known you since Brownies, and the only time I ever saw you cry was when Bush won.Lucy Kelson: Which one?Meryl Brooks: Well, both of them.========================================George Wade hires lady lawyers strictly for their looks. His brother tells him that has got to stop:-------------------------Howard Wade: You need someone who can write a brief instead of removing yours.================================Seeing that Lucy is a bright lawyer, he offers her a lavish salary which she accepts. He is banking on the fact that they are really not each other's cup of tea, and so will not be distracted from the business at hand. All goes extremely well, but George begins to rely on Lucy more and more.------------------Lucy Kelson: What did I tell you that defines an emergency?George Wade: A large meteoroid, severe blood loss and uh... what was the other thing?Lucy Kelson: Death! And you're not dead!=============================It is at this juncture in time that Lucy gives George the Two Week Notice referred to in the title. She begins interviewing replacements, and none seem suitable, or even adequate, until in walks a bright young redhead fresh out of Harvard, June Carver (Alicia Witt). June moves in for the kill, and soon Lucy is feeling quite a bit jealous, realizing too late that she has fallen in love with the dashing and debonair George. June usurps her role and becomes his date for a charity function that he had originally invited Lucy to. June wears a top hat that is so Betsy's Wedding it isn't funny, or maybe it's a little funny, but it is mainly just very hot, a black top hat instead of a white one. For me, this was an unexpected treat. Alicia Witt is not only beautiful, she is smart, too. Intelligence, not power, is the ultimate aphrodisiac, my apologies to Henry Kissinger.---------------June Carter: Do you know what I like even more than chess?George Wade: Pok&eacute;mon?======================Strip Chess? Wow. With Alicia Witt? What could be more tantalizing than that? Don't worry; it is all very tastefully done. But wait a minute; we are supposed to be in Kelson's corner. We are rooting for Lucy, not June. So Alicia Witt plays June as just a bit of a... well, you know.Alicia Witt got her start in David Lynch's Dune, but I remember her as Cybill's daughter Zoey Woodbine on Cybill's sit com, Cybill. She was a smart and sassy redhead who played piano. In real life she was a classically trained pianist who used to play the piano at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. She was also kind of a child prodigy. At the tender age of four she appeared on ""That's Incredible!"" (1980) to show off her amazing reading skills, and she also performed the balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet with the host. Her mother, Diane Witt, was in the Guinness Book of World Records from 1988 to 1996 for having the world's longest hair. One wonders if it was also red, and what a splendid sight that would make. Alicia herself modeled what is purported to be the most expensive hat ever made, the $2,700,000 Chapeau d'Amour designed by Louis Mariette, at Christie's in London. Last time I saw her was as Miss Pasternak on 2 and a Half Men, where she was devastatingly cute, though her character was a little bit crazy.Director Marc Lawrence is an expert at crafting Rom Com vehicles for either Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock. He wrote Forces of Nature and Miss Congeniality, and he wrote and directed Two Weeks Notice, Music and Lyrics, and Did You Hear About the Morgans? Since he is so adept at creating and filming material for both Grant and Bullock, you'd expect a film with the two of them together to be a slam dunk. And it is.Marc Lawrence has a good ear for music, and he even plays harmonica on the opening track, a re-mix of ""Baby, You've Got What it Takes"" performed by Dinah Washington & Brook Benton. Other featured musical performers include Counting Crows featuring Vanessa Carlton, Perry Como, Mel Torm&eacute;, Xavier Cugat, Fountains of Wayne, Aretha Franklin, Stanley Turrentine, James Brown, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Michael Bubl&eacute;, Norah Jones, Dusty Springfield, Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway, and Al Green. Norah Jones, doing the Hoagy Carmichael, Ned Washington chestnut ""The Nearness of You"" even performs her number in person. Other great musical moments were when Hugh Grant's character George Wade struts to ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,"" and when they repurposed Bachman-Turner Overdrive's ""Takin' Care of Business"" to mean the number 2 meaning of business.Bottom Line is that Two Weeks Notice is a five-out-of-five star Romantic Comedy, and the material is perfect for both Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock to work their particular brand of magic on. Added bonus is Alicia Witt, who really stirs things up. She can be my check mate, any day. It is a silly, frothy mixture, but it goes down so smooth and satisfying.-------------------------------------George Wade: Divorce always gives me an appetite. Kabob?Lucy Kelson: No thanks.

The movie works because the two stars have good chemistry and play off each other well. The ending is a foregone conclusion, but it's entertaining to see how these two get there.What's a little scary is to see that Alicia Witt, a talented young actress and gifted pianist (remember Cybil's sardonic, red-haired daughter on her last TV series?) has gone the route of too many Hollywood actresses and looks, in this movie, alarmingly thin. When you're so acutely aware of the bones in a performer's chest that you scarcely notice her performance, something's very wrong.This is a pleasantly entertaining movie; nothing challenging. Some good laughs and good performances elevate this one to above average.

The story is simple, Bullock plays Lucy Kelson, a Harvard graduated lawyer who spends most of her time fightinf lost causes.  She is determined to save a Community Center that has stood in her childhood neighborhood for generations.  Enter George Wade, Grant, the tycoon whose company is planning on buildinga high rise condo community where the center stands.  He is need of a lawyer who can actually think while chewing gum (he's a bit of a womanizer, and his brother tells him to hire a woman with substance.)  In order to get her to work for him, he promises to save the community center and build around it.  Her new job turns into more of a personal assistant than Chief Attorney, as she has to help him pick stationary and clothes.  The line is crossed however when George calls Lucy out of her best friends wedding to help him pick out a suit.  In frusturation, she turns in her resignation and gives him two weeks notice.  He convinces her to stay long enough to hire and train a replacement.  The replacement comes in the form of red head vixen, June, played by Alicia Witt.  June moves in quickly, using her charms and her looks to get in the bosses..  um good graces.  Lucy realizes too late that she has feelings for George, and thinks she has lost him to June.

When she has a chance meeting with high-powered businessman George Wade (Grant) on the sidewalk outside his building, they find that they each have something the other needs. She needs his backing to ensure that the community center won't be displaced by a massive new construction project, and he needs a new chief counsel for his firm.When she mentions she went to Harvard Law, he immediately offers her a position. She takes it, somewhat hesitantly, having heard of his reputation through the grapevine, (he had til then been more interested in dating his attorneys than consulting them). Comedy ensues as the two butt heads as they go about their business, literally, in their hugely disparate styles. He is mellow, quirky, quick with his jokes and one-liners, she is professional, tightly-wound, in control, but not entirely content in the role. One gets the feeling that she wouldn't mind loosening up around the edges, relaxing a little.. if she could just learn to delegate a little, and/or count on her new boss to hold up his end of the bargain once in a while (which he doesn't really see as that much of a priority, at least at first.) As the two share some highly stressed and emotionally charged, and then eventually some relaxed, enjoyable times as they go about their days together, they slowly come to realize, as Lucy prepares to leave Grant's employ, that they are falling for one another.There's a song that goes, ""You don't know what you got til it's gone,"" and this movie amply highlights that turn of events.. once Wade faces losing Lucy, he starts to realize how dependent he's become on her, and how empty his life would be without her, how much he'd miss her if she wasn't there to pick out his ties, shop for furniture together, cope with the latest business or personal catastrophe, or just exist, side by side, in life.This film embraces some romantic comedy cliches and avoids others, basically making it a fresh, if somewhat predictable foray into romantic comedy-dom. I really enjoyed it, as with most of Grant & Bullock's films.. it's a great date movie and a solid entry into the romantic comedy genre.

With a combined resume of past works consisting Bridget Jone's Diary, Notting Hill, Forces of Nature, and While You Were Sleeping, it is quite surprising that it took so long for Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock to work together until now.  Both actors have accumulated quite a fan following, so there is no doubt that the film will be profitable, even in the midst of a month crowded with quality movies, but will it be worth your time and the price of the admission?A Harvard law school graduate, Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) dedicates most of her time to preserving historical landmarks the big corporations of New York are bent on destroying for the sake of urban development.  In her efforts to save the Coney Island community center, she makes a deal with George Wade (Hugh Grant) of the Wade Corporations.  In return for his promise to keep the building, she agrees to take the job as his new chief counsel.  However, everything does not go according to Lucy's plan.  Instead of her dreams of utilizing the company's vast resources to address issues she is most passionate about and to help those that are less fortunate, she finds herself at George's beck and call, making every decisions from his wardrobe to his prospective dates.  Realizing that this is not what she signed on for, Lucy decides to call it quits, but George refuses to let her go until she finds a replacement for herself, a task that becomes increasingly harder as the days go by.It is a good thing that Bullock and Grant are both very likeable on screen, because even though the characters they often portray are very similar, you nevertheless enjoy their performances due to the personalities they bring to these roles.  Unfortunately, this is not the case in Two Weeks Notice.  In fact, I found myself feeling apathetic towards Lucy and George, and I really could care less what happens to them.  This is not to say that Bullock and Grant did not try their best, the problem is they had very little to work with, since how can you breathe life to characters that don't have any to start off with?Although the chemistry is definitely there among the two leads, it just does not seem to work.  To me Lucy and George act more like a pair of bickering siblings than a couple; their constant bantering and arguments did not help to convince me of their unspoken love and attraction towards each other.  I am sad to say that I was extremely bored by the experience, and the laughs are too few and far in between.The bottom line is that Two Weeks Notice is neither funny nor romantic.  The dialogues are flat and the characters are stereotypically predictable.  Scenes rarely flow smoothly from one to the other, the whole film feels very much like going through a scrapbook where random events are cut and pasted together.  The worse thing about it is the blatant attempt to sell a mediocre story based on the strengths and popularity of two well-established veterans of the genre.  If there is one movie that can make both Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock dull and unattractive to watch, this is definitely it.  I simply cannot recommend Two Weeks Notice, it is clearly deserving of a pink slip.",2,"Neither funny nor romantic, Bullock/Grant failed to deliver",1040083200,"12 17, 2002",2002,3271,"['Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'first', 'time', 'collaboration', 'two', 'biggest', 'names', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'combined', 'resume', 'past', 'works', 'consisting', 'Bridget', 'Jone', 'Diary', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Forces', 'Nature', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'quite', 'surprising', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'work', 'together', 'now', 'actors', 'have', 'accumulated', 'fan', 'following', 'doubt', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'profitable', 'even', 'midst', 'month', 'crowded', 'quality', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'price', 'admission', 'Harvard', 'law', 'school', 'graduate', 'Lucy', 'Kelson', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'most', 'time', 'preserving', 'historical', 'landmarks', 'big', 'corporations', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'bent', 'destroying', 'sake', 'urban', 'development', 'efforts', 'save', 'Coney', 'Island', 'community', 'center', 'deal', 'George', 'Wade', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Wade', 'Corporations', 'return', 'promise', 'keep', 'building', 'take', 'job', 'new', 'chief', 'counsel', 'However', 'everything', 'not', 'go', 'according', 'Lucy', 'plan', 'Instead', 'dreams', 'utilizing', 'company', 'vast', 'resources', 'address', 'issues', 'most', 'passionate', 'about', 'help', 'are', 'less', 'fortunate', 'George', 'beck', 'call', 'making', 'decisions', 'wardrobe', 'prospective', 'dates', 'Realizing', 'not', 'what', 'signed', 'Lucy', 'call', 'George', 'let', 'go', 'replacement', 'herself', 'task', 'increasingly', 'harder', 'days', 'go', 'by.It', 'good', 'thing', 'Bullock', 'Grant', 'are', 'very', 'likeable', 'screen', 'even', 'characters', 'often', 'portray', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'nevertheless', 'enjoy', 'performances', 'due', 'personalities', 'bring', 'roles', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'fact', 'found', 'feeling', 'apathetic', 'towards', 'Lucy', 'George', 'really', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'what', 'not', 'say', 'Bullock', 'Grant', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'best', 'problem', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'work', 'how', 'can', 'breathe', 'life', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'start', 'off', 'chemistry', 'definitely', 'two', 'leads', 'just', 'not', 'seem', 'work', 'Lucy', 'George', 'act', 'more', 'pair', 'bickering', 'siblings', 'couple', 'constant', 'bantering', 'arguments', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'convince', 'unspoken', 'love', 'attraction', 'towards', 'other', 'am', 'sad', 'say', 'was', 'extremely', 'bored', 'experience', 'laughs', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'far', 'between.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'funny', 'romantic', 'dialogues', 'are', 'flat', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypically', 'predictable', 'Scenes', 'rarely', 'flow', 'smoothly', 'one', 'other', 'whole', 'film', 'feels', 'very', 'much', 'going', 'scrapbook', 'where', 'random', 'events', 'are', 'cut', 'pasted', 'together', 'worse', 'thing', 'blatant', 'attempt', 'sell', 'mediocre', 'story', 'based', 'strengths', 'popularity', 'two', 'well-established', 'veterans', 'genre', 'one', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'dull', 'unattractive', 'watch', 'definitely', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'clearly', 'deserving', 'pink', 'slip']",Two Weeks Notice

I've often said that I think Grant has impeccable comedic timing, and this is what saves this movie.This DVD came out around the same time as Maid In Manhattan.  If you could only see one, make it this one -- MIM was a snoozer.  However, that doesn't make this one come out smelling like a rose.  The premise wasn't bad -- Sandra Bullock plays a Birkenstock wearing lawyer who is not at all caught up in the trappings of success (largely b/c she has no $$), but winds up working for an irreverent, playboy executive in an attempt to save a building in her neighborhood.  See the movie to see how that transpires exactly.  At any rate, it's a culture clash.  Along the way, love blossoms unbeknownst to either party until the end ... of course.  The movie is predictable, but again, Hugh's humor saves the day.  While Bullock comes off as whiney much of the time, she garners just enough sympathy and has enough beauty to pull it off.  Hugh is the star of this show though.  It seems right up his alley to play the suave, albeit shallow, playboy (About A Boy, Nine Months, etc.), so he plays it well.  We should be disgusted by him right along with Bullock, yet he's endearing and likable as ever.  And his quips and one-liners really hit the mark.Bottom line:  Don't go into this movie expecting a laugh-fest, but do expect Grant's consistent and ongoing comedic flair.  Don't go into this movie expecting a warm and fuzzy Kate and Leopold-esque feeling, but do expect to root for Bullock at least over her sleazy adversary.

Don't get me wrong -- it's highly watchable and isn't bad, and it's something I'll enjoy renting in the future to watch again. But the sparks, the chemistry that I expected just fizzled. Sandra Bullock's character was too stiff -- and there was no back story to indicate why despite the distracting presence of her character's parents. As for Hugh's character, his family (brother, mother and father) were ever-present, but their was no explanation as to why he was the way he was.  The movie wanted you to develop this sympathy for these two lost lonely -- but funny in a quirky sort of way -- souls, but I found myself looking at my watch 40 minutes into the film.Bottom line: I think the movie just tried too hard to cash in on Sandra Bullock's past successes. Is it coincidental that her character's name is Lucy -- the same name as her character in her best (in my opinion) movie to date, ""While You Were Sleeping""? And the role of ""best friend"" is the actress who played her fellow contestant who turned into friend in ""Miss Congeniality"" (another cute movie).

745712,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B00008NRI7,L.A. Scene,"[1, 3]","Hugh Grant seems to have perfected the role of playing the spoiled young Rich person.  In many of his films, this is the role he has been cast into - and he has done a brilliant job at perfecting his character in each of these roles.  I've become a big fan of Hugh Grant's - not because of the characters he plays, but because he probably has become the top actor in his profession when it comes to Romantic Comedy films.  Whether it's physical comedy, dry humor or even witty humor, Grant always seems to come through.  Once again, Grant comes through big time in the Romantic Comedy ""Two Weeks Notice"".  In this film, Hugh Grant is teamed up with Sandra Bullock.  Grant once again delivers a terrific performance, but the surprise of the movie comes from supporting actress Alicia Witt.  Witt shows why she is a rising talent in Hollywood.The film takes place in New York City with an emphasis on Coney Island in Brooklyn.  The story of the film involves Bullock's character Lucy Kelson.  Lucy is a crusading attorney seeking to save a Community Center in Coney Island from Demolition.  The company that is trying to demolish the center is the Wade Corporation - which is led by Hugh Grant's George Wade character.  George is a young handsome and popular New York Real Estate Developer.  When Lucy confronts George on the issue, George offers her a job as his Chief Legal Counsel.  Lucy decides to take the job as it will give her the resources to fight for many of her causes.  Lucy moves into her new job, but instead of providing legal counsel to George on business matters - she soon finds herself giving advice and counsel to many personal issues involving George's life.  Lucy soon finds herself at George's beckon-call on almost everything.  Getting frustrated with George's dependence on her - Lucy offers her resignation and gives George's 'two weeks notice'.  George accepts Lucy's resignation and Lucy agrees to help find a replacement.  The replacement turns out to be Alicia Witt's June Carter character.  When George begins to hit things off very well both professionally and personally with June, feelings of jealousy begin to surface.  At first, neither George or Lucy can admit feelings for each other - but things end up very predictably in the end.As mentioned, Hugh Grant delivers another stellar performance.  While in movies such as ""Nine Months"", we've seen Grant able to pull of the physical comedy, we see Grant focus on his witty sense of humor. Throughout the movie, Grant comes back with several one-liners and these are delivered flawlessly.  An example of this is when Lucy tries to find another job and George calls all prospective employers trying to stop them from hiring her.  Lucy gets wind of this and confronts George.  Lucy tells George ""You called everyone but Slurpee Heaven"".  George responds ""That is not true.  I did call Slurpee Heaven.  They didn't want you.  Said you had attitude.  Said you weren't Slurpee material"".  This is just one example on how Grant is able to pull off the character of George Wade perfectly.  There are numerous examples of this.  While on the surface, it may seem that anyone could pull of this witty humor - I find with Hugh Grant this is genuine and it works.I've always found Sandra Bullock an overrated actress.  While Bullock has a good fit at playing the ""high maintenance""  Lucy Kelson character,  While even after seeing Bullock's Lucy Kelson character, I still think she is overrated - I do think there was good chemistry between Bullock and Grant.  ""Two Weeks Notice"" does employ a common Romantic Comedy formula of two people not getting along - but being drawn close together.  Bullock and Grant's chemistry seems to fit this formula well, thus makes the movie enjoyable.As mentioned above, I felt Alicia Witt became an emerging star in this movie.  Witt does a great job at playing June Carter.  At first June is the timid new-hire out of college.  But Witt does a great job at transforming June into the young opportunist that becomes the perfect rival for Lucy Kelson.  While I wouldn't tag June as the ""villain"" of the movie, she clearly is pitted against Lucy in the movie - especially when it becomes clear that June's real motives are more for George himself as opposed to the job.One thing I really enjoyed was the New York City setting for this movie.  While I've always preferred Hugh Grant when the setting is in England (""Nine Months"" and ""About a Boy""), I like that how Grant fits into New York City and Coney Island.  Parts of the film were shot on-location in Coney Island.  While I think it's a fair criticism that the film doesn't show the real Coney Island (an area of Brooklyn that still is in need of being cleaned-up), I do think the film does a terrific job at showing that there still are some positives about the Coney Island area.  The film also features a Helicopter ride that George and Lucy take - that gives a great view and insight of New York.  There also is a terrific scene filmed on the Queensboro Bridge when Lucy is in desperate  need of using a bathroom, but unfortunately is in a major traffic jam.There are some interesting cameos in the movie.  New York Mets Catcher Mike Piazza has a cameo when George and Lucy are at a Mets game at Shea Stadium.  Donald Trump (whom is portrayed as George's Real Estate Developer rival for obvious reasons) has an encounter with George as a fundraising party.  Finally, Norah Jones has a cameo as a Piano Singer.Overall, this is a great movie to check out.  Romantic Comedy and Hugh Grant fans will not be disappointed.  But even if you aren't a fan of these two - there is a great charm to this movie.

I am a big fan of both Sandra Bullocks and Hugh Grant, as they are charismatic and talented actors with a feel for comedy. Unfortunately, even they cannot overcome a witless script and the ham-handed direction of Marc Lawrence.Sandra Bullock plays the role of neurotic Lucy Kelson, a Harvard Law School grad who follows in the footsteps of her activist parents by becoming an activist lawyer.  Hugh Grant is in his element as George Wade, a real estate developer and playboy tycoon. When they are brought together by fate,  they strike a deal that they believe would be in each of their respective best interests. Lucy will work for George as his chief counsel, while George promises not to apply the wrecker's ball to her beloved Coney Island community center.Unfortunately, as time passes, these two opposites begin to be attracted to each other. Just as fate contrived to bring them together, however, it appears that fate will also tear them apart. When Lucy discovers that George will be unable to keep his promise about the Coney Island community center, she gives him two weeks notice. Enter June Carter (Alicia Witt), also a Harvard Law grad and Lucy's replacement. The luscious June quickly sizes up George Wade and sets her cap for him, causing Lucy to suffer pangs of jealousy of which she had been previously unaware.There are no surprises in this formulaic film. Hugh Grant does his slightly wacky British turn, while Sandra Bullocks  turns in another intelligently ditzy, infectious performance.  It is the script and the direction, however, not the actors, that jettison this remarkably unfunny, romantic comedy. The laughs are few and far between. The dialogue is one dimensional and cartoonish. It fails to build a believable romance between the two main characters. Quite frankly, all the film does is waste the considerable talents of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullocks, as well as the viewer's time. It is an unintelligent, pedestrian film that would otherwise have tanked but for its star power.",2,SPARE ME...,1062547200,"09 3, 2003",2003,2071,"['daughter', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Sandra', 'Bullocks', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'are', 'charismatic', 'talented', 'actors', 'feel', 'comedy', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'witless', 'script', 'ham-handed', 'direction', 'Marc', 'Lawrence.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'role', 'neurotic', 'Lucy', 'Kelson', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'grad', 'who', 'footsteps', 'activist', 'parents', 'becoming', 'activist', 'lawyer', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'element', 'George', 'Wade', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'playboy', 'tycoon', 'When', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'fate', 'strike', 'deal', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'respective', 'best', 'interests', 'Lucy', 'will', 'work', 'George', 'chief', 'counsel', 'George', 'not', 'apply', 'wrecker', 'ball', 'beloved', 'Coney', 'Island', 'community', 'center.Unfortunately', 'time', 'passes', 'two', 'opposites', 'begin', 'be', 'attracted', 'other', 'Just', 'fate', 'contrived', 'bring', 'together', 'however', 'fate', 'will', 'also', 'tear', 'apart', 'When', 'Lucy', 'George', 'will', 'be', 'unable', 'keep', 'promise', 'Coney', 'Island', 'community', 'center', 'two', 'weeks', 'notice', 'Enter', 'June', 'Carter', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'also', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'grad', 'Lucy', 'replacement', 'luscious', 'June', 'quickly', 'up', 'George', 'Wade', 'cap', 'causing', 'Lucy', 'suffer', 'pangs', 'jealousy', 'had', 'been', 'previously', 'are', 'surprises', 'formulaic', 'film', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'slightly', 'wacky', 'British', 'turn', 'Sandra', 'Bullocks', 'intelligently', 'ditzy', 'infectious', 'performance', 'script', 'direction', 'however', 'not', 'actors', 'jettison', 'remarkably', 'unfunny', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'dialogue', 'one', 'dimensional', 'cartoonish', 'build', 'believable', 'romance', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'film', 'waste', 'considerable', 'talents', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Sandra', 'Bullocks', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'time', 'unintelligent', 'pedestrian', 'film', 'would', 'otherwise', 'have', 'tanked', 'star', 'power']",Two Weeks Notice

One day she is lying on the pavement between an historic building and the wrecker's ball when she meets playboy George (Hugh Grant), the public spokesman for the very corporation that wants to knock down the landmark.  George is between lawyers at the moment (his CEO brother fired the last one), and when he finds out Lucy actually has a degree from Harvard, he impulsively offers her a job and a promise to spare her Coney Island rec center.And from there on it was just annoying.  A couple of critics called this screenplay undernourished; I'd say emaciated.  The best romantic comedies have a busy, likable supporting cast to add layers of interest and tone to the primary storyline (remember Notting Hill and While You Were Sleeping?); Grant and Bullock were pretty much on their own.  The two of them, mostly just the two of them, George`s outrageous insensitivity and Lucy's indignation in the same tiresome pattern that begged for denouement long before Lucy finally gave her two weeks' notice.  What bridesmaid leaves her cell phone on at the altar of her best friend's wedding, anyway?  And it still took too long for this to end.  Grant had a lot of witty one-liners; but I thought he was too offhand, as if contemptuous of the material.  Bullock was charming, but not charming enough to save this mess.Obviously, production costs were kept to the minimum.  Locations were unvaried, supporting cast almost invisible, cinematography bland, clothes blah.  Bullock as Producer must have figured that two big stars would bring in the audience before word spread how awful this really was.  And she thought this romantic comedy was so good, she couldn't possibly make a better one?  I'm pretty charitable when it comes to a movie of this genre.  It only has to look good, sound good, and make me feel good.  This one was zero for three.I've learned something.  If you're reading these reviews in order to decide whether or not to purchase the dvd, don't go by ""Most Helpful"" reviews.  People get on here and vote Yes, it was helpful, when they have already seen the movie and agree with the review.  This tends to inflate positive reviews.  Instead, look at the star rating profile at the top.  If most people really loved the movie and you probably will, too, the profile will have a bulge at 5 stars tapering down smoothly to a very thin or non-existent tail at 1.  If instead of a smooth descent from 5 the distribution is lumpy; or especially if 1-plus-2's add up to about the same as the 5's, maybe you ought to rent first.

745725,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00008NRI7,Martin Asiner,"[2, 4]","TWO WEEKS NOTICE is clearly an attempt by director Marc Lawrence to herald in what he hoped would be this generation's Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. What made Tracy and Hepburn resonate with the audience was that despite their on-air bickering, one could see that there was a core of misguided, if not misplaced, emotion bubbling to reach the surface. But with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock, what became apparent from the opening reel was that while both have the star power individually to carry a romantic movie, collectively they simply do not bounce off one another in a manner that lets the audience grow to care about their deliberately emphasized differences. And in films like TWO WEEKS NOTICE, it is the degree to which the audience connects to these differences that mark such movies as truly engaging experiences. Unfortunately, TWO WEEKS NOTICE does not ring true in any area that counts.Hugh Grant is George Wade, a multimillionaire real esate developer who is rich in name only. His more unattractive brother has wisely allowed him to stand as the sexy and successful symbol for Wade Enterprises. George is unabashedly handsome in the self-deprecating manner that has long since been the essential Hugh Grant trademark. He flits from affair to affair, all of which costs him plenty, but since he has his rich brother's money to back him up, he can afford to buy a hot dog and pay for it with a $100 bill, and not ask for change. In his job as company spokesman, he is incredibly incompetent. He does not even know what suit to wear for a social function, much less decide when and where to build a monstrous condo that only a Trump would love. Enter Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) who is everything that George is not. He is egotistical, hedonistic, and much aware of his shortcomings in business acumen. Lucy is modest, altruistic, but possessed of a huge ego that manifests itself in a desire to Save the World from evil developers like George Wade. Now these differences might have been enough to generate humor and audience attachment to the actors had these actors showed even a glimmer of compatability. Instead, director Lawrence tries to show a Tracy-Hepburn sense of appealing squaking by contrasting some rather appalling scenes of grossness. Lucy Kelson has just eaten a chili dog that she warns is about to make an unexpected appearance. George is then forced to find a handy toilet, and since both are in a car on the FDR Highway, it takes somes some doing to resolve in a way that is more nasty than humorous. Far too many of similar such scenes remind the audience that what they are watching are actors trying vainly to be lightly and humorously romantic. Not for one moment can one willingly suspend one's belief to enter the world of a romantic comedy that Grant and Bullock try so hard but in vain to achieve. The fault is not theirs, since both are appealing in scenes in which they appear solo. The problem is a poor script that relies too heavily on the sight gag and the pratfall.

745729,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00008NRI7,Matthew Horner,"[6, 8]","""Two Weeks Notice"" is another pleasant, mildly diverting romantic comedy from Sandra Bullock's production company. The director, Marc Lawrence, also wrote the script. He was responsible for penning [but not directing] two other Bullock successes, ""Miss Congeniality"" and ""Forces of Nature"". If ""Two Weeks Notice"" to those films, it's only because the co-star is the marvelous Hugh Grant, who could make a movie about constructing chicken coops charming and funny. The difference between Ms. Bullock and Mr. Grant is that she is only as good as the material she is given, whereas he can rise above even the most mediocre script.In this romantic romp, Bullock plays Lucy Kelson, a Harvard educated lawyer from Coney Island. She battles to save an historic community center from being destroyed by a billionaire real estate tycoon, George Wade [Grant]. Charmed by his promises to save the center, she winds up working for him. Eventually, the job proves too frustrating for her because her solid work ethic clashes with his playboy attitude. She gives her notice, which he seems to accept cheerfully. During the course of her working out her notice, it becomes clear that, while they can't work together, their relationship may work out on another, more intimate level.The film romps happily and swiftly through it rather flimsy plot. Issues like the community center's being saved naturally take a back seat to the issue of Lucy and George's relationship's being salvaged. The problems are that the dialog isn't that sharp and that most of the jokes fall a bit flat. Still, Bullock and Grant have a pleasant enough chemistry and are obviously having a good time. One can only hope that Bullock will soon find a writer who can successfully hone in on her true comedic talents. In the right hands, she could be the funniest leading actress in movies today.",3,Okay Bullock comedy enhanced by Hugh Grant's preformance,1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,1852,"['Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'pleasant', 'mildly', 'diverting', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'production', 'company', 'director', 'Marc', 'Lawrence', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'was', 'responsible', 'penning', '[', 'not', 'directing', 'two', 'other', 'Bullock', 'successes', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'Forces', 'Nature', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'films', 'only', 'co-star', 'marvelous', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'constructing', 'chicken', 'coops', 'charming', 'funny', 'difference', 'Ms.', 'Bullock', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'material', 'given', 'can', 'rise', 'above', 'even', 'most', 'mediocre', 'script.In', 'romantic', 'romp', 'Bullock', 'Lucy', 'Kelson', 'Harvard', 'educated', 'lawyer', 'Coney', 'Island', 'save', 'historic', 'community', 'center', 'being', 'destroyed', 'billionaire', 'real', 'estate', 'tycoon', 'George', 'Wade', '[', 'Grant', ']', 'Charmed', 'promises', 'save', 'center', 'up', 'working', 'Eventually', 'job', 'too', 'frustrating', 'solid', 'work', 'ethic', 'clashes', 'playboy', 'attitude', 'notice', 'accept', 'cheerfully', 'course', 'working', 'out', 'notice', 'clear', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'together', 'relationship', 'may', 'work', 'out', 'more', 'intimate', 'level.The', 'film', 'romps', 'happily', 'swiftly', 'rather', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'Issues', 'community', 'center', 'being', 'saved', 'naturally', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'issue', 'Lucy', 'George', 'relationship', 'being', 'salvaged', 'problems', 'are', 'dialog', ""n't"", 'sharp', 'most', 'jokes', 'fall', 'bit', 'flat', 'Still', 'Bullock', 'Grant', 'have', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'are', 'obviously', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Bullock', 'will', 'soon', 'find', 'writer', 'who', 'can', 'successfully', 'hone', 'true', 'comedic', 'talents', 'right', 'hands', 'could', 'be', 'funniest', 'leading', 'actress', 'movies', 'today']",Two Weeks Notice

Could you think of a more perfect film? I can. Miss Congeniality is one of my all-time favourite movies, Sandra Bullock is my favourite actress, and Hugh Grant . . . Who doesn't like Hugh Grant?But this film is a movie too far. There's nothing original about this film. OK, it's pleasant enough to watch. But there's nothing new, it's not thought provoking, and both Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are getting very overly typecast in their roles. And they're not doing anything to stop themselves being typecast. I own quite a few Sandra Bullock films, and she's the same in every single film - the girl next door who's a major klutz, and always gets the guy in the end. Hugh Grant is the exact same. Apparently, his role in Bridget Jones's Diary was more of a ""bad guy"" role. I don't think so somehow.Anyone could have thought up this story. No offence to Marc Lawrence, but he needs to expand his ideas a bit, and not choose predictable storylines. You know Sandra & Hugh are going to get together at the end of the film, despite all the obstacles that are thrown in their way (in the shape of Alicia Witt). They start off hating each other, and finish the film madly in love. Now, where have I heard that one before?Hugh and Sandra make a good couple on-screen, and judging by their antics during the extras, make a good couple off screen. Which has sparked many a rumour about them actually being a couple in the press. But they just get on extremely well, and you laugh watching them not being able to look each other in the eye without laughing and ruining the take.The extras are pretty basic. You've got a great looking commentary, featuring Marc Lawrence & Sandra Bullock (they made a great commentary for Miss Congeniality); a documentary; the theatrical trailer (you see the whole film just watching this); and a bloopers reel thing. You get some interesting comments from the stars, including one that I want in writing from Sandra, saying that now she's done this film, she feels she can put this genre to rest. I think that's not before time! (She's also remarkably frozen around the face area for a 39-year-old).It's an average film. It's watchable. It passes the time.

Grant strikes up a deal that he'll spare the building if she comes to work for him.

From there, it's just a matter of time till the ill-matched pair realize they'e in love and one can certainly guess where the movie ends up.Bullock and Grant are in good form, with Grant getting all the good lines, and the film uses contemporary pop songs effectively, letting the music mirror the particular scene.

Yes of course you know how the movie ends and yes some of the inevitable plot twists occur but it's the little things that set it apart that make this movie stand out from others in the genre.  Bullock's rival for George is actually a pretty decent gal and not the stereotypical you-know-what.  Plus, the ""little things"" that occur during George and Lucy's relationship as it develops are actually well played out.  One scene that stands out in my mind is the little ""lunch business meeting"" the two had which was strictly business and professional but well played out as to give that ""they're gonna hook up"" vibe.  Overall you should come out of this movie pleased.BEST SCENES:1. Stuck in the bathroom2. ""Gotta go and it's rush hour""/trailor home3. The aforementioned lunch business meeting4. Extreme Tennis5. Chinese take outVERDICT:Overall, you'll get a nice kick out of Grant and Bullock's take on the romantic comedy.  This movie of course works best for couples on a date or the younger crowds looking for a flick to spend the night or weekend away on.  You should come out of this saying, ""that was cute"" or ""that was a good one.""  Besides, it's Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant so you know it's good.Highly Recommended",4,Not a Bad Tweak to the Formula&#65533;,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,2193,"['Starring', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'know', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'set', 'once', 'again', 'New', 'York', 'apparently', 'town', 'where', 'action', 'Bullock', 'Grant', 'take', 'stab', 'ever-so-popular', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'good', 'results.THE', 'STORY', 'Lucy', 'Kelson', 'Bullock', 'activist/environmentalist/all-around', 'defender', 'little', 'guy', 'lawyer', 'who', 'job', 'corporate', 'attorney', 'billionaire', 'playboy/nice-guy-but', 'unintentional', 'capitalist', 'pig', 'George', 'Wade', 'attempt', 'save', 'community', 'center', 'condemned', 'favor', 'development', 'project', 'Wade', 'huge', 'conglomerate', 'Naturally', 'opposite', 'sides', 'fence', 'first', 'year', 'Lucy', 'George', 'slowly', 'find', 'becoming', 'interdependent', 'one', 'everything', 'sparks', 'slowly', 'surely', 'start', 'fly', 'them.THE', 'ANALYSIS', 'NOT', 'connect-the-dots', 'type', 'love', 'story', 'really', 'appeals', 'being', 'connoisseur', 'genre', 'Yes', 'course', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'yes', 'inevitable', 'plot', 'twists', 'occur', 'little', 'things', 'set', 'apart', 'make', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'others', 'genre', 'Bullock', 'rival', 'George', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'gal', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'you-know-what', 'little', 'things', 'occur', 'George', 'Lucy', 'relationship', 'are', 'actually', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'One', 'scene', 'out', 'mind', 'little', 'lunch', 'business', 'meeting', 'two', 'had', 'was', 'strictly', 'business', 'professional', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'give', ""'re"", 'gon', 'hook', 'up', 'vibe', 'should', 'come', 'movie', 'pleased.BEST', 'SCENES:1', 'Stuck', 'bathroom2', 'Got', 'ta', 'go', 'rush', 'hour', '/trailor', 'home3', 'aforementioned', 'lunch', 'business', 'meeting4', 'Extreme', 'Tennis5', 'Chinese', 'take', 'outVERDICT', 'Overall', ""'ll"", 'get', 'nice', 'kick', 'Grant', 'Bullock', 'take', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'movie', 'course', 'works', 'best', 'couples', 'date', 'younger', 'crowds', 'looking', 'flick', 'spend', 'night', 'weekend', 'away', 'should', 'come', 'saying', 'was', 'cute', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'know', 'good.Highly', 'Recommended']",Two Weeks Notice

I found the trip in TWO WEEKS NOTICE to be an utterly delightful one.The key to a formula film is getting the viewers to like the main characters, and more than that, liking the idea of the two of them together.  I found both Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant's characters to be immensely likeable, and I enjoyed the chemistry the two had together, even before they realized they were romantically inclined towards one another.  If the film had a flaw, it was that we didn't get enough semi-romantic scenes before the last half hour of the movie.  Still, apart from one thing, I found the movie to be utterly delightful as a whole.  Not a masterpiece, but a heck of a lot of fun.  My one real gripe was a major bathroom scene.  Has potty humor ever improved a movie?  More to the point, has potty humor ever not harmed a film?  This was a major false note in an otherwise fun film.

745763,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00008NRI7,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 0]","Sandra Bullock is one of the best-looking butt-of-the-joke movie comediennes in showbiz, and a savvy producer to boot: She's carved a respectable if not overwhelming niche in the romantic and dramatic comedy market by helming high-gloss, middle-brow, self-depreciating entertainments aimed at the easygoing set. Bullock is not as gifted as Reese Witherspoon  or as high-wattage as Julia Roberts, but, to use an adage of old folks across America, you could often do a lot worse.For ""Two Weeks Notice"" Bullock was able to drum up Hugh Grant to play opposite her romantic lead, which is a kind of testament to the credibility she's built for herself over time. Grant doesn't look particularly comfortable at times in the movie, especially during its second half, but he doesn't phone it in as he did in ""Mickey Blue Eyes.""Grant, as a playboy real estate mogul, and Bullock, as his long-suffering liberal lawyer, tap dance through the opposites-attract opening before Bullock offers her notice to quit, frustrated with her bosses' inability to commit to the importance of his work. A subtle rival (gorgeous Alicia Witt) arrives to take Bullock's place, and, as many of Bullock's movies do, Witt plays a type of smart, sexually subversive lass instead of the straight heavy.That takes much of the wind out of the comedic sails of ""Two Weeks Notice"" while pressing the button of intricate female drama. Watch how, with great precision, the rivalry comes to head over a tiff on a particular piece of office equipment Bullock would like to take as a memento; most male critics bemoaned the lack of villainy in Witt's performance, but women better recognize the type: sweet, manipulative, a little too willing to be seduced, the minx disguised as a mouse.Bullock and Grant have decent chemistry, though it does not match up with the chemistry Bullock had with Ben Affleck in ""Forces of Nature"" or the cop/criminal attraction she had with Gosling in ""Murder By Numbers."" When Grant's funny, ""Two Weeks Notice"" is funny; when he's thrown into earnestness by the movie's second half, ""Two Weeks Notice"" is left with Bullock v.

745772,A2G606VQGJ5EN9,B00008NRI7,Sodalug,"[1, 2]","Let me get a little personal bias out of the way right up front - I don't like romantic comedies as a movie genre. In fact I can't think of a single decent one off hand. They are overwhelmingly unoriginal, unfunny, and unromantic star vehicles that fail to even accomplish their stated goal and contribute nothing to the world of film. So the fact that I don't hate this film says something I suppose.A movie like this plays heavily on the audiences existing belief that opposites attract in order to make the unlikely romantic connection more plausible. I don't know how true this common belief is in reality - I suspect it is not as successful as the saying would have us believe. Plus it creates plenty of good comedic situations when the two opposites interact.Hugh Grant is pretty much a lock with female audiences - every punch line he delivered got a strong response from the audience no matter how lame. The film establishes early on that Grant's character is really a good guy deep down but is unduly controlled by his older brother - a convenient excuse.I find Bullock fairly believable in her slightly novel role as a grittier, career driven leading lady. It first emerged in Miss Congeniality in which Bullock plays a tough as nails FBI agent working undercover as a beauty pageant contestant. However her character creates what I would call a critical plot flaw in Two Weeks. The film would have us believe she is a class leading Harvard lawyer - yet she hesitantly accepts Grants deal to work for him on the condition that his company spare her beloved community center from the wrecking ball. She writes an air tight employment contract that is so strong she cannot find a way out of it when she needs to - and at the same time fails to lock in the only thing she really cares about in the condition that the community center be saved. Have the standards at the vaunted Harvard Law fallen so low?A little bit of trivia: Coney Island is also the setting of one of my favorite films Requiem for a Dream. Sandra Bullock reminisces about the old neighborhood at one point and mentions an old couple, the Goldfarbs. Sarah Goldfarb was a lead character in Requiem and I'm guessing this is more than just a coincidence. Also in Requiem, director Aronofsky recalls in the director commentary that the famous and historic Thunderbolt rollercoaster was bulldozed in the middle of the night by a wrecking crew on the orders of then mayor Rudy Giuliani during his ""cleanin up NY phase"" in an attempt to avoid any such protests. It was replaced with a parking garage. This lends some credibility to Bullock's struggle to save the buildings around Coney Island.

745775,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,B00008NRI7,Susan Fong,"[1, 1]","""Two Weeks Notice"" is a romantic comedy about Lucy, an idealistic and gutsy Harvard law school graduate (played by Sandra Bullock), who is hired into a prestigious law firm by the firm's jet-setting partner, George (portrayed by Hugh Grant).  George's brother owns the firm.George enjoys considerable wealth and perks afforded by his position.  He is handsome and rather charming, and he is divorced after philandering.  Lucy and George are direct opposites.  Lucy is from a working, middle class family.  Her mother is a law professor and her father is an attorney with a social conscience.  George seems to have inherited his privileged lot in life.Like her father, Lucy is compassionate towards the underdog.  Her latest crusade is an attempt to save a community center located in an aging building.  George's brother wants to demolish this building and replace it with a profitable high-rise. He expects George to close the deal on this project even though George is conflicted because of his increasing  respect and admiration for Lucy.When Lucy leaves the law firm in favor of pro bono work, her replacement is a pretty, ambitious, and calculating young Harvard graduate who immediately sets her sights on George.  Complications arise because Lucy has feelings for George and vice versa.""Two Weeks Notice"" is a competent comedy.  However, to thoroughly appreciate its story, one has to be sympathetic to the lead characters.  Lucy is a person of integrity and conviction.  George only begins to develop these qualities because of his association with Lucy.  For most of the movie, George is a shallow, materialistic womanizer.  It is doubtful that these two would actually end up together.Still ""Two Weeks Notice"" is a fairly pleasant diversion especially if you are fans of Bullock or Grant.

The film only really gives into full fledged Pretty Woman esc romance at the end.

This time we have the ""everlasting"" Hugh Grant to co-star with Sandra in this love and hatred, boss and employee relationship movie. Sandra as a Harvard law grad with a law professor mother devoted her life to justice, helping the poor and preserving the community against the rage of large corporations. In an attempt to save the community centre, she accepted the offer of her dead enemy Hugh Grant's offer to help him as his consultant in return for preserving the community centre during the development of the area. The story kicks off from that, and there are lots of funny and minute details that can drive the audience laugh. Sandra's character is funny, though at times you can still find traces of the cop she played in Miss Congeniality (which is something she needs to pay attention to). Hugh Grant is surprisingly fit for the character as a nasty and self-centred boss, who finally realised what he needs is a bossy women to whom he could relied on. His lines were delivered with wit. The screeplay is well written with all the good killing gags that can tickle your heart. All the supporting characters are very good too, especially Sandra's parents in the movie, they are splendid.

745782,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00008NRI7,Tucker Andersen,"[32, 35]","This is a throughly enjoyable, light as air movie that you should go to see when you just want to relax, smile a lot and spend some time watching Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock have fun. No serious message, no real surprise twists and turns; but despite being totally formulaic it was a traet and we and the rest of the audience were often laughing out loud.Sandra Bullock is Lucy, a dedicated environmental lawyer following in the ""do good save the world"" footsteps of her parents. Hugh Grant is the rich shallow playboy developer whose project she wants to halt. He shocks her by offering to hire her; they strike a deal to save her beloved Coney Island neighborhood center from the wrecker's ball in return for her becoming his counsel. Of course, she soon becomes his indispensable aide, eventually becomes disillusioned, and gives her TWO WEEKS NOTICE. Her relacement invokes jealousy in Lucy, the community center is about to be demolished due to George's brother's (and partner) efforts to make their project profitable after cost overruns, and Lucy heads back to her former life in her parent's cramped apartment.Of course, what the moviegoers have always known is by now dawning on George and Lucy. Namely, they may be as different as day and night but will be miserable without each other. And, so, in the tradition of such feel good films, George overwhelms Lucy with the grand romantic gesture and after some initial confusion and ambilavence she eventually overcomes her doubts and recognizes her true feelings for him.The pace is right, the jokes mostly work, and the supporting cast is more than adequate. So, go see this when you are in the mood for fun rather than adventure, drama, tension, action or deep meaning. It is about on par from the usual work of Bullock and Grant, but if you are a dedicated fan of either don't expect it to measure up to their best work; the material just isn't stong enough.",4,A Fun Romantic Comedy For Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant Fans,1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,1921,"['throughly', 'enjoyable', 'light', 'air', 'movie', 'should', 'go', 'see', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'relax', 'smile', 'lot', 'spend', 'time', 'watching', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'have', 'fun', 'serious', 'message', 'real', 'surprise', 'twists', 'turns', 'being', 'totally', 'formulaic', 'was', 'traet', 'rest', 'audience', 'were', 'often', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Lucy', 'dedicated', 'environmental', 'lawyer', 'following', 'do', 'good', 'save', 'world', 'footsteps', 'parents', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'rich', 'shallow', 'playboy', 'developer', 'project', 'halt', 'offering', 'hire', 'strike', 'deal', 'save', 'beloved', 'Coney', 'Island', 'neighborhood', 'center', 'wrecker', 'ball', 'return', 'becoming', 'counsel', 'course', 'soon', 'indispensable', 'aide', 'eventually', 'disillusioned', 'TWO', 'WEEKS', 'NOTICE', 'relacement', 'invokes', 'jealousy', 'Lucy', 'community', 'center', 'be', 'demolished', 'due', 'George', 'brother', 'partner', 'efforts', 'make', 'project', 'profitable', 'cost', 'overruns', 'Lucy', 'heads', 'back', 'former', 'life', 'parent', 'cramped', 'apartment.Of', 'course', 'what', 'moviegoers', 'have', 'always', 'known', 'now', 'dawning', 'George', 'Lucy', 'Namely', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'different', 'day', 'night', 'will', 'be', 'miserable', 'other', 'so', 'tradition', 'such', 'feel', 'good', 'films', 'George', 'Lucy', 'grand', 'romantic', 'gesture', 'initial', 'confusion', 'ambilavence', 'eventually', 'doubts', 'true', 'feelings', 'him.The', 'pace', 'right', 'jokes', 'mostly', 'work', 'supporting', 'cast', 'more', 'adequate', 'So', 'go', 'see', 'when', 'are', 'mood', 'fun', 'rather', 'adventure', 'drama', 'tension', 'action', 'deep', 'meaning', 'par', 'usual', 'work', 'Bullock', 'Grant', 'are', 'dedicated', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'measure', 'up', 'best', 'work', 'material', 'just', ""n't"", 'stong', 'enough']",Two Weeks Notice
