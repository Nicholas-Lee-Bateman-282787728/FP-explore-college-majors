871909,A1ZPVW0WXNJ3YZ,B0006Q93C4,"Alex ""47""","[27, 30]","Drake and Josh is my favorite show on Nickelodeon. Even though there are no DVD season boxsets out yet, this DVD came out in early 2005 and I bought it. Here is my review ( I have no life ).[*] Indicates a ""DVD Great""----------[*]Pilot: 4.5/5 This is the first episode of the series. Drake and Josh become step brothers and Drake realizes that Josh is a real loser in school. In a case of mistaken identity, Josh has to fight a ""jealous boyfriend"".[*]Dune Buggy: 4.5/5 Drake and Josh get a dune buggy from Drake's friend, Trevor, but find out that it doesn't run. After getting it fixed, Drake and Josh aren't allowed to even drive it. Josh gets grounded for lying because of Drake, and Drake takes the dune buggy for a ride regardless. He crashes into a tree and tries to hide his injuries.Two Idiots And A Baby: 4/5 Josh volunteers to babysit, but Drake abandons the baby to play a concert with his band. Josh soon loses the baby and looks tirelesly around the house for him. Soon, Meghan reveals that she had it the whole time and nobody knows what happened.[*]First Crush: 4.5/5 Josh promises to play a birthday song on guitar at a girls birthday party. Having no idea how to play it, he has Drake teach him, but the strings on the guitar snap. Drake comes up with a plan that makes Josh look like he's playing it but he really isn't.Special Features: Outtakes: 5/5 On this DVD there are 8 minutes of outtakes. They are pretty good, too, and are well worth watching. Makes the DVD all more worth the money.----------Overall, this is an excellent DVD. The quality for some reason is furry-like on the episodes, but the episodes are still great. It has some of the first episodes of this great series. I really think you should buy it. Since it is from the first season, you will notice some things. First, the whole entire house looks different; especially Drake and Josh's room. The door doesn't even face the same way, and the whole room looks different entirely. You will also notice some ""slip-ups"" by the director, but you'll forgive them. You should really buy this DVD if you are a Drake and Josh fan. It's really just a bummer there are only 4 episodes and there hasn't been a new volume to this for about a year and a half now.4.5/5",5,An awesome DVD; I'm hoping for more.,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2244,"['Drake', 'Josh', 'favorite', 'show', 'Nickelodeon', 'Even', 'are', 'DVD', 'season', 'boxsets', 'out', 'yet', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'early', '2005', 'bought', 'Here', 'review', 'have', 'life', '[', '*', ']', 'DVD', 'Great', '[', '*', ']', 'Pilot', '4.5/5', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'become', 'step', 'brothers', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'real', 'loser', 'school', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'Josh', 'fight', 'jealous', 'boyfriend', '[', '*', ']', 'Dune', 'Buggy', '4.5/5', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'get', 'dune', 'buggy', 'Drake', 'friend', 'Trevor', 'find', 'out', ""n't"", 'run', 'getting', 'fixed', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'even', 'drive', 'Josh', 'grounded', 'lying', 'Drake', 'Drake', 'dune', 'buggy', 'ride', 'regardless', 'tree', 'tries', 'hide', 'injuries.Two', 'Idiots', 'A', 'Baby', '4/5', 'Josh', 'volunteers', 'babysit', 'Drake', 'baby', 'play', 'concert', 'band', 'Josh', 'soon', 'baby', 'tirelesly', 'house', 'Soon', 'Meghan', 'had', 'whole', 'time', 'nobody', 'what', 'happened', '[', '*', ']', 'First', 'Crush', '4.5/5', 'Josh', 'promises', 'play', 'birthday', 'song', 'guitar', 'girls', 'birthday', 'party', 'Having', 'idea', 'how', 'play', 'Drake', 'teach', 'strings', 'guitar', 'snap', 'Drake', 'up', 'plan', 'Josh', 'look', 'playing', 'really', ""isn't.Special"", 'Features', 'Outtakes', '5/5', 'DVD', 'are', '8', 'minutes', 'outtakes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Makes', 'DVD', 'more', 'money.', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'quality', 'reason', 'furry-like', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'first', 'episodes', 'great', 'series', 'really', 'think', 'should', 'buy', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'notice', 'things', 'First', 'whole', 'entire', 'house', 'different', 'especially', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'room', 'door', ""n't"", 'even', 'face', 'same', 'way', 'whole', 'room', 'different', 'entirely', 'will', 'also', 'notice', 'slip-ups', 'director', ""'ll"", 'forgive', 'should', 'really', 'buy', 'DVD', 'are', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'fan', 'really', 'just', 'bummer', 'are', 'only', '4', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'been', 'new', 'volume', 'year', 'half', 'now.4.5/5']","Drake & Josh, Vol. 1: Suddenly Brothers"

Each episode deals with a different topic or situation typical to kids around that age -- though admitedly, some of the issues and situations would only come up if you lived in CA or you were progeny of yuppie parents.The episodes are highly entertaining and there's good chemistry between the actors. Each episode has an underlying message, but it's never preachy nor so obvious that it feels like they're beating you over the head with it.My son loves this, and I even find it entertaining.

I really have not heard of this sitcom until Drake Bell's appearance in the 2005 version of ""YOURS, MINE AND OURS"".  But the first time I saw it, I was immediately hooked on it.  Josh Peck is my favorite on the show.  This is a very funny show the whole family will enjoy and this DVD gives you the opportunity to check out the show's early episodes.  I highly recommend it. Sometime in the near future, hopefully, Paramount and Nick will come out with the complete first season of DRAKE AND JOSH on DVD Box Set.",5,DRAKE AND JOSH: VOL. 1: SUDDENLY BROTHERS,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,716,"['time', 'when', 'television', 'dominated', 'crappy', 'reality', 'show', 'family', 'hour', 'almost', 'extinct', 'NICKELODEON', 'sitcom', 'Drake', 'Bell', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'truly', 'pleasant', 'escape', 'really', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'sitcom', 'Drake', 'Bell', 'appearance', '2005', 'version', 'YOURS', 'MINE', 'AND', 'OURS', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'immediately', 'hooked', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'favorite', 'show', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'opportunity', 'check', 'out', 'show', 'early', 'episodes', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Sometime', 'near', 'future', 'hopefully', 'Paramount', 'Nick', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'DRAKE', 'AND', 'JOSH', 'DVD', 'Box', 'Set']","Drake & Josh, Vol. 1: Suddenly Brothers"
