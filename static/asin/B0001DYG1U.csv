801758,AY7EXIYJ2LG5S,B0001DYG1U,ADSHippin,"[11, 12]","If you are a fan of WWII history then this is the film for you.  It is the true story of RAF Bomber Command's raids on the M&ouml;hne and Eder dams. Additionally it's the story of 617 squadron's birth; which even today is one the RAF's most successful and highly decorated squadrons.  The special effects are a bit primitive by today's standards; however because of this the actors actually have to act.  If you can find it I strongly encourage reading the terrific book The Dam Busters by Paul Brickhill.Some of the more interesting points of the movie are: The death of Wing Commander Gibson's dog, just before the raid.  Then there is the somber silence we have for the crews who where lost.  Like the missing crews at the mess table, or the ""If I don't return letter"" sitting on the desk.  Then at the very end Guy Gibson telling Barnes Wallis after the raid that he needs ""to write a few letters before turning in"".On the comical side there is the poultry farmer writing a nasty letter to the RAF.  This poor man has the misfortune to live near one of the lakes that 617 squadron is using to practice over before the raid.  The poor old fellow is just trying to make an honest living and support Britain's war effort, when there are dozens of 4 engine Lancaster Bombers roaring over his farm at 60 Feet off the ground day and night.A minor word of caution to any viewers who are Black, the name of Wing Commander Gibson's dog refers to what once a legitimate colour (very dark chocolate brown) in Great Britain.  As opposed to the more modern and now almost universal racial swear for people who are Black.  Please remember this 1952 movie was intended to be a reasonable historically accurate movie, based upon the events of 1942.Again a really top notch movie with some superb shots of the Lancaster Bomber.PS. I wonder how many people who watch this film realize that there is now only TWO Lancaster's still flying?

801766,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0001DYG1U,C. O. DeRiemer,"[6, 8]","The problem was simple. The solution was difficult. The cost was high. The result was not everything that was expected or even hoped for.The Dam Busters tells us, with patriotic steadfastness and gallant actions, the development of a bouncing bomb, the story of Squadron 617 and then the action code-named Operation Chastize, carried out on May 17, 1943. Nineteen British aircraft set out on a high-risk mission to destroy key dams providing water and electricity for Germany's Ruhr industrial complex. A new bouncing bomb would be used to skip across the water, smash into the targeted dams and explode. Delivering the bombs required flying skills of the highest order. The planes had to sweep in very low and very fast through mountains and valleys, using unproven altimeters and primitive bomb sights. The crews had to release the bombs, now set to spinning in open bays, at the precise moment when calculations gave the bombs the best chance to skip and not sink and to strike exactly where they should.The first part of The Dam Busters is the story of Professor Barnes Wallis (Michael Redgrave), whose idea for a bouncing bomb is nearly smothered by disbelieving civilian and military bureaucrats. Barnes is brilliant, innovative and extraordinarily persistent. Somehow, he succeeds in developing his spinning, bouncing bomb and convinces the war leaders that it can destroy dams where conventional bombing wouldn't.The second part concentrates more on Wing Commander Guy Gibson (Richard Todd), who has been appointed leader of Squadron 617. He is charged with developing the flying tactics that will get his squadron over the target and successfully deliver the bombs. He has to come up with new flying techniques that will maximize the chances for success. These also maximize the chances for crashing into mountains and receiving a lot of German flak. He also will lead the attack. Through it all a typically inspiring music score will thump away.Wallis' eccentric genius as he develops his bomb, fixes the glitches and deals with Whitehall is at times amusing but usually inspiring. Redgrave does a fine job with his character. Gibson's assurance and courage in the face of great personal risk (which at times almost seems that gambling with death has become some sort of exciting drug for him) is both inspiring and unnerving. Todd gives the standard ever-optimistic but serious-in-the-face-of-death portrayal that so many war movies dish up. Todd, like John Mills, was good at this sort of thing. He makes his character believable. The run into the Ruhr valley so low the crews could almost shake hands with the civilians, with flak crashing about, the planes shaking, the crews trying to make everything work as it should, the now spinning bombs let loose and bouncing off the waters toward the dams, and then the steep, steep climb of the remaining planes is gripping.How successful was the mission? The movie doesn't deal with this, only with Wallis' ingenuity and the inspired heroism of the men who flew, who died and those who survived. But let's take a look at what wartime gallantry can bring. Of the several targeted dams, two were breeched and extensive flooding and destruction ensued. Of the 19 aircraft that set out, 11 returned. Of the 133 aircrew members 53 were killed and three became prisoners of war. Within a month after the raid, the Germans had restored water output back to normal and the Ruhr electricity grid was again producing power at full capacity. Of the more than 2,000 men and women who were killed in the flooding, more than half were Allied prisoners of war and forced laborers.Professor Barnes, who also was the father of the earthquake bomb, was knighted and died full of honors at 92 in 1979. Wing Commander Guy Gibson was awarded the Victoria Cross and was killed a year later on another mission. He was 26 years old.With operations like this, war leaders usually tell us later how much home front morale was improved, how much we learned from the operation, how many resources the enemy had to reallocate to guard against further such attacks, and how the gallantry and courage of our fighting men and women are without parallel. Often these leaders are themselves awarded medals and ribbons and honors. Perhaps we need fewer of these leaders who seem so easily caught up in the kind of gallantry that always results in the deaths of many brave young men and women. For those interested in ""gallant"" ideas that lead to the essentially pointless deaths of courageous young soldiers, you might want to watchA Bridge Too Far,DieppeandCockleshell Heroes.The DVD has no extras. The video and audio transfers are not exceptional but do no major harm to enjoying the movie.",4,"A bright war-time idea combines with brave men, but (an inconvenient question) did their deaths change

Slipman,"[1, 1]","Michael Anderson's ""The Dam Busters"" was a solid documentary style drama based on a true story regarding the revolutionary developement of a new form of wartime munitions.  The distinguished Sir Michael Redgrave plays Dr. Barnes Wallis, the progenator of a bomb that when launched at low altitude can skim along the surface of water.  This was specifically devised in order to breach a series of dams guarding the Ruhr valley in Germany's vitally important industrial heartland.Redgrave's invention was initially scoffed at but through his persistence the military was finally convinced to institute a secret mission to utilize his deadly invention.The spring of 1942 was the target date for the attack when the dams were at their fullest.  The 617th RAF Squadron lead by wing commander Guy Gibson played by Richard Todd commenced an arduous training regimen consisting of difficult low altitude flying.  Eventually the men were well schooled enough and the mission was carried out.The grim determination of the men was in evidence as they attempted to take the battle to the Germans.

801772,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B0001DYG1U,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","1954's ""The Dam Busters"" is a detailed and dramatic account of the heroic British Royal Air Force raid against three dams in the Ruhr Valley of Germany during the Second World War.  The dams were considered virtually immune to conventional bombing techniques; the raid was notable for the use of experimental five ton bombs delivered at low attitude against the inside face of the dams.  The raid was unfortunately also notable for the high casualties among the raiders.  The squadron that carried off the raid lost eight of 19 planes, with 56 of 133 men killed.The first half of the story is built around the efforts of inventor Barnes Wallis (Michael Redgrave) to convince a reluctant military bureaucracy to use his unique round bombs.  The second half is the painstaking training of the dam busters by Wing Commander Guy Gibson (Richard Todd).  The actual attack is a thrilling series of flying sequences, as Lancaster bombers maneuver through curtains of flak to hit the proper release point to bounce their bombs into the dams.The movie benefits from the use of period aircraft, equipment, uniforms and the like.  The special effects were cutting edge for their day.  The black and white photography is crisp and realistic.  It is rather unfortunate that the pilots spend much of the movie hidden behind their oxygen masks.  The movie makes an unmistakable point about the sacrifices of the pilots and aircrew who didn't make it home.

machine by damaging its  industrial capacity..It is a movie in two  parts .The first details the invention and testing of the legendary ""bouncing bomb""by the great inventor Barnes Wallis (Michael Redgrave).The second part deals with the training of the air crews chosen to carry out the raid ,building up to the night of the raid itself.The raid is  lead by Wing Commander Guy Gibson(Richard Todd)Redgrave is exceptional in his portrait of the ultimate ""back room boffin"",an eccentric scientific genius who treads a fine line between inspiration and obsession.He doggedly pursues his plan to strike a decisive blow right to the heart of the enemy with a single decisive dagger thrust rather than, as he brillinatly describes the strategic bombimg offensive ,""kill him with a million peashooters"" .The picture gives us a detailed evocation of the research and development of the weapon often in the face of obstructionism from the civil service .It is a world of windswept firing  ranges and chilly test tanks .The movie does not gloss over either the failures and false starts or the obstacles thrown up by petty bureaucracy.In the second part ,as the night of the raid draws ever nearer  the camera dwells on the small group of men who must carry out the attack -the focus is on their rituals as thw wait in their various ways to be called into action ,knowing that many will not return.They play impromptu games of cricket,lounge upon the grass or simply patiently sit and wait their call to action.The raid is skillfully shot by director Anderson and he is at his best in the scenes following the raid,s completion -empty tables in the mess halls,clocks ticking in the stillness ,as the camera prowls through the rooms of the dead liongering on empty chairs and vacant soaces in the mess hall.The shot of Gibson walking away to write letters to the relatives of those who did not return is doubly poignant when you realise it was a task that fell to Todd -who served in World War 2 -in real life.This movie deatils a small scale operation with big repercussions and does so in a semi-documentary style which makes it truly compelling viewing .It is a portrait of understated

The bomb came out of the work of a Government Committee that looked at a number of ways of shortening the War and the Ruhr Dams and Hughes Gun were two of their startling successes although probably the former saved more Allied lives. Bursting the dams was a  feat of extraordinary scientific genius by Barnes Wallis (who was Victor's chief designer and designed the Lancaster Bomber) and courage by the RAF. There has to be a huge caveat that breaking the Dams had less effect than had been supposed although it did divert German slave labor from other tasks.The Dam Buster's mission pays tribute to extreme bravery and skilled flying with only primitive instruments. The music by Eric Coates is a major and memorable feature of the movie. I am always brought to tears by the story of that dog. The movie is apparently being remade as of 2012 (not sure why). The original movie was made in black and white in the early fifties using the most primitive of models and limited Lancaster bombers which then still existed. It was very much Film Noir and captured the black and white era of the Second World War. Modern movie makers will not be able to recreate the feel of that era: the fear and the desperation. There are a number of books on the making of the Dam Busters and lots of published material on the other of Barnes Wallis's bombs including the 'Block Busters'. But the most important point is that 'The Dam Busters' was made for entertainment and to give some joy to austerity Britain of the early fifties. What was really important to its success was Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd. The screen play was superb with so many memorial moments.

It's a long movie as these things go and must have been crazy expensive to produce back in the day, what with borrowing and restoring all those Lancasters, etc.The star power is pretty evenly divided between Michael Redgrave, his hair dusted gray and white, seemingly in a replay of his famous star turn as the lonely schoolmaster in The Browning Version.  Redgrave plays a top scientist boffin who can't get the government to fund his costly experiments into a better way to bomb  the three hydroelectric dams of the Ruhr Valley.  The movie plays it fair and thus makes it more suspenseful, in that Redgrave's plans do seem a little bit crazy and one can't quite believe they would ever work in real life....  And his diffident slash egotistical way of presenting his arguments doesn't help win him any converts.  So the whole first hour of the film is built around his struggle and how he nearly gave up.  His wife, played by beloved British actress Ursula Jeans, has very little to do but sew the buttons back on her absent minded professor husband and hold his hand when he's feeling blue and misunderstood.  We never get a sense of what she's about or what she wants to happen, in the war or otherwise.  Jeans doesn't bring much to the part, but if you like maternal love she delivers it in big bundles.  Redgrave's own sexual conflicts color our watching of The Dam Busters nowadays, so that the repeated storyline of him returning to his wife, defeated by the big boys, his tail between his legs, has another message which he seems to be playing with constantly.Part Two brings us Richard Todd as the flight commander with the adorable dog.  Todd is excellent in the part, though he seems strangely short next to the strapping chaps he serves with, like Tom Cruise in Top Gun.  Was Todd really a little man?  His dog is as big s he is.  This dog has a pleasing personality but an unfortunate name which makes me dislike the real life pilot who could name his pet such a thing.  And they don't just use the name once--which would have been painful enough--they keep calling him the name, over and over--at least a dozen times.  I don't know what black people make of this film, but I can see why the BBC had a showing where they scrambled the dog's name to ""Trigger.""  Censorship, or just common sense?  Anyhow Todd whips his boys into shape and has one great scene where, discouraged about the difficulties of low flying over water, he takes his friend to a West End musical and in the middle of a spectacular chorus girl number, he gets the perfect idea from watching how expert stagehands illuminate the musical theater!  They should adapt this scene for Glee!  I understand that in real life, this inspiration did not happen quite this way, but it is super effective on film.  Kudos to scenarist R.C. Sherriff, the man who wrote the classic antiwar drama JOURNEY'S END, then sold out and wrote more than his share of pro-war movies for all the big studios.  His skill never deserted him.  And even more kudos to director Michael Anderson, too often dismissed as a journeyman hack, but who shows in this film at least the speed, efficiency, suspense and camaraderie of a Howard Hawks or Anthony Mann.",4,"Michael Anderson, Underrated Director",1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,3299,"['took', 'awhile', 'get', 'Dam', 'Busters', 'was', 'worth', 'end', 'long', 'movie', 'things', 'go', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'crazy', 'expensive', 'produce', 'back', 'day', 'what', 'borrowing', 'restoring', 'Lancasters', 'etc.The', 'star', 'power', 'pretty', 'evenly', 'divided', 'Michael', 'Redgrave', 'hair', 'dusted', 'gray', 'white', 'seemingly', 'replay', 'famous', 'star', 'turn', 'lonely', 'schoolmaster', 'Browning', 'Version', 'Redgrave', 'top', 'scientist', 'boffin', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'government', 'fund', 'costly', 'experiments', 'better', 'way', 'bomb', 'three', 'hydroelectric', 'dams', 'Ruhr', 'Valley', 'movie', 'fair', 'thus', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'Redgrave', 'plans', 'do', 'seem', 'little', 'bit', 'crazy', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believe', 'would', 'ever', 'work', 'real', 'life', 'diffident', 'slash', 'egotistical', 'way', 'presenting', 'arguments', ""n't"", 'help', 'win', 'converts', 'whole', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'built', 'struggle', 'how', 'nearly', 'gave', 'up', 'wife', 'played', 'beloved', 'British', 'actress', 'Ursula', 'Jeans', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'sew', 'buttons', 'back', 'absent', 'minded', 'professor', 'husband', 'hold', 'hand', 'when', 'feeling', 'blue', 'misunderstood', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'about', 'what', 'happen', 'war', 'otherwise', 'Jeans', ""n't"", 'bring', 'much', 'part', 'like', 'maternal', 'love', 'big', 'bundles', 'Redgrave', 'own', 'sexual', 'conflicts', 'color', 'watching', 'Dam', 'Busters', 'nowadays', 'repeated', 'storyline', 'returning', 'wife', 'defeated', 'big', 'boys', 'tail', 'legs', 'message', 'be', 'playing', 'constantly.Part', 'Two', 'brings', 'Richard', 'Todd', 'flight', 'commander', 'adorable', 'dog', 'Todd', 'excellent', 'part', 'strangely', 'short', 'next', 'strapping', 'chaps', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Was', 'Todd', 'really', 'little', 'man', 'dog', 'as', 'big', 's', 'dog', 'pleasing', 'personality', 'unfortunate', 'name', 'real', 'life', 'pilot', 'who', 'could', 'name', 'pet', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'use', 'name', 'once', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'painful', 'enough', 'keep', 'calling', 'name', 'over', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'black', 'people', 'make', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'BBC', 'had', 'showing', 'where', 'scrambled', 'dog', 'name', 'Trigger', 'Censorship', 'just', 'common', 'sense', 'Anyhow', 'Todd', 'boys', 'shape', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'discouraged', 'difficulties', 'low', 'flying', 'water', 'friend', 'West', 'End', 'musical', 'middle', 'spectacular', 'chorus', 'girl', 'number', 'perfect', 'idea', 'watching', 'how', 'expert', 'stagehands', 'illuminate', 'musical', 'theater', 'should', 'adapt', 'scene', 'Glee', 'understand', 'real', 'life', 'inspiration', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'quite', 'way', 'super', 'effective', 'film', 'Kudos', 'scenarist', 'R.C', 'Sherriff', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'classic', 'antiwar', 'drama', 'JOURNEY', 'END', 'then', 'sold', 'out', 'wrote', 'more', 'share', 'pro-war', 'movies', 'big', 'studios', 'skill', 'never', 'deserted', 'even', 'more', 'kudos', 'director', 'Michael', 'Anderson', 'too', 'often', 'dismissed', 'journeyman', 'hack', 'who', 'film', 'least', 'speed', 'efficiency', 'suspense', 'camaraderie', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Anthony', 'Mann']",Dam Busters

801791,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0001DYG1U,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This war film based on actual events is an already immortal classic, still as powerful in Year of Grace 2014 as it was when first released in 1955. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.1. Operation ""Chastise"" and real ""Dam Busters""Operation Chastise was an attack on three German dams carried out on 16-17 May 1943 by Royal Air Force No. 617 Squadron flying specially modified Lancaster bombers and using a new weapon: ""bouncing bomb"" invented and developed by renown engineer Barnes Wallis (amongst his earlier realisations was the design of Vickers Wellington bomber). This mission was unusually dangerous because to succeed British bombers had to attack at low speed and very low attitude, risking at any moment crashing in the ground, when in the same time being exceptionally vulnerable to the Flak, including the numerous 20 mm guns, which usually were not a concern to four engine bombers operating at high attitude...As the result of the attack, the M&ouml;hne and Edersee Dams were breached, causing catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley and of villages in the Eder valley - the third target, Sorpe dam, sustained only minor damage. Two hydroelectric power plants were destroyed and several more were damaged. Numerous factories and mines were also damaged to diverse degree due to flooding and an estimated 1,600 people drowned. Even if the damage was repaired by Germans, production in affected areas didn't return to normal before September 1943.The cost to the attackers was high, as out of 20 Lancasters which took off for the attack 8 were lost and 53 crew members were killed with 3 more being taken prisoners.What made this incredibly daring and very successful operation even more remarkable, was that, although it was not made on purpose, the 617th squadron was a very multinational and diverse outfit, with crews hailing from all over the Commonwealth: United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and amongst the pilots there was even one American volunteer serving with RAF, Lieutenant Joe McCarthy.Following the Dams Raid 617 Squadron was kept together as a specialist unit and participated in numerous bombing operations, frequently using other types of specialised ordnance developed by Barnes Wallis, including giant Grand Slam and Tallboy bombs. It was with those latter munitions that the 617th Squadron attacked and destroyed in 1944 German super-battleship Tirpitz in its base in Norway. The squadron is still active today.Very sadly, Wing Commander Guy Gibson, the officer in command of the whole mission, didn't survive the war - he was killed in action (probably shot down by a German fighter) on 19 September 1944, when flying a target marking Mosquito over Netherlands. He was only 26 years old. Five of men who flew on the same bomber with him in operation ""Chastise"" were killed even earlier, during another bombing mission over Germany on 16 September 1943.2. The filmThe film was made in 1955, when Barnes Wallis and many ""Dam Busters"" were still alive, therefore it was possible to consult with them extensively and as result this film sticks quite closely to the reality of things. This real deal feeling was also helped by RAF contributing three real Lancaster bombers taken out of reserve and refit for service for the needs of this film.The narration is strictly chronological, from the moment when Barnes Wallis got the idea of ""bouncing bombs"", through the phase of conception of those new munitions, experimentation and modifications until finally the introduction in service. Then begins the phase of selection of crews for the mission, training and other preparations and finally the extremely dramatic mission itself.For the needs of the film some changes were of course introduced, the most important of which is the whole struggle Barnes Wallis has to wage with war time bureaucracy (both civilian and military) to even be able to launch the whole project of ""bouncing bombs"". In reality no such thing took place, to the contrary, Wallis, who was already very well known in this time, received lots of support and was efficiently backed up by both civilian and military hierarchy, which explains how this project advanced so fast.Another interesting thing is that in 1955 the whole ""bouncing bomb"" technology was still a military secret, therefore in the film the bombs have the shape of spheres, when in the reality they were shaped as barrels...Finally, another major change was made to make the action even more dramatic - in the film one of the bombers crashes into a mountain as it is not able to pull up fast enough from the bomb run (I am NOT saying which bomber it is...). In reality no such thing happened during the bomb run but some planes damaged by Flak crash landed after the attack itself was over.The music written for this film is of course already a legend - the ""Dambusters March"" achieved already immortality and will certainly continue to be performed, listened to and adored for centuries.3. My impressions about the filmThe first time I saw this film was ages ago, in communist Poland, when I was still a boy - and it was an ""eyes wide open, nail biting, jaw dropping"" experience! And now, after re-watching it recently, I was very pleased to see that with time it didn't lose any of its fire power!The success of the film is certainly not due to special effects which in 1955 were nothing like those available today. This film is also in black and white and action scenes happen at night, which should logically diminish their impact - but it is NOT the case! No, the real reason why ""Dambusters"" is so good is the strength of scenario and a perfectly structured narration of the story, an art frequently forgotten (or simply discarded) in today's films. The tension is build up from the beginning, with initially just a hint that something REALLY big is going to happen and then the stakes are raised slowly but regularly, until the moment when Gibson and his men see this first dam... At that moment the viewers couldn't care less about special effects as we are already so immersed in the story that no escape is possible, even if the Flak started to shoot spaghetti instead of tracers...To conclude on the action scenes - their age notwithstanding they still pack such power that together with the great finale from ""633 Squadron"" (a lesser war film describing a fictitious raid) they very strongly inspired George Lucas when he was creating the archi-famous sequence of rebel fighters attacking Death Star in ""Star Wars"".The way in which the heroism of those incredible men is described is another treasure. The whole story is narrated in a matter of fact way, as if it was just another day at the office - it just so happens that the office for those men is deep inside the enemy territory. There is no pathos, there is no drama, there is no soul searching, there is no PrTSD (Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder, something that figures in most of modern war movies), no politically correct pseudo-psychological babble (are we the good guys? Are we REALLY the good guys? Are we REALLY, REALLY, REALLY the good guys?), which all affect so badly so many modern war films.Here things are told simply and calmly and the viewers are trusted to be adult enough to understand by themselves how terribly dangerous that mission was and how it took real balls to fly at the lowest possible level into this Valley of the Shadows of Death, with Flak in the front, on both sides and even above(!) on the hills, carrying an enormous bomb exposed to enemy fire and still go at the target - MORE THAN ONCE if the first approach was unsuccessful!I heard many rumours that a remake of ""Dambusters"" is being prepared in USA, but until now nothing concrete was ever announced. Honestly, I am of two minds about it - on one hand I would be tempted to see this raid again, with the state of the art XXI century special effects but on another, when I think of all the abominations, horrors and other indignities visited lately upon war stories by Hollywood (just think of ""Pearl Harbour"", ""U-571"" or ""Wind Talkers"") I would as much prefer that at least this masterpiece remains unspoiled...There were many book written abouth this famous raid, but if I was to recommend just one I think I would go with ""Dambusters. Operation Chastise 1943"" by Doug Dildy, published by Osprey in its ""Raid"" series in October 2010. It is a small book, only 80 pages long, but quite comprehensive and it may be a good idea to read it before watching (re-watching) this film.CONCLUSION: this is a GREAT film, a GREAT classic, still as powerful today as in 1955. To buy, watch, keep and re-watch. Enjoy!",5,"A major classic, aged but still wearing that crown, towering over the competition!

This includes an extensive telling of the R & D and testing of various prototypes leading up to the final portrayal of the mission itself.  You get a sense of the man himself, and his sense of duty to his country.  His personal bravery and &#34;Get 'er done&#34; outlook served England well in those dark days of WW2.  Richard Todd is a good choice as the overall commander of the raid, Guy Gibson.  Gibson was a very short man who had a reputation for great courage and organization.

His reply was we had very limited special effects as in today's world but we could fudge the film with a little Hollywood trickery & angles but for some scenes we used actual artillery fire with ex-gunners from WW2 ,of course they knew how to lead or follow the A/C while placing the rounds harmlessly away from the A/C but with proper camera angles & a little trickery we got it pretty close. I found that pretty interesting as my Dad was an anti/aircraft gunner on the front during WW2. My Dad took me to see the movie as he was quite familiar with the raid.

801804,AK61LQI92GTCH,B0001DYG1U,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[2, 4]","As Michael Redgrave's character observes in this 1953, based-on-a-true story of the WWII development and deployment of `bouncing' bombs used to destroy the great dams of Germany, and in the process cripple their industrial capacity, there's a thin dividing line between inspiration and obsession.  Redgrave plays the slightly potty shack-scientist Dr. Barnes N. Wallis, CBE, FRS.  Dr. Wallis has figured out why dams are so darn hard to blow up - in theory, anyway - and spends a good third of the movie convincing the powers that be to let him develop a practical bomb based on that theory.  Conventional attack, at least before Wallis applied his considerable intellect to the challenge, had bombs dropped from a great height a slight space away from the dam wall.  As the movie explains, that slight space and the water intervening between the bomb and the wall creates a cushion that neutralizes the bomb's force.  For them to work, bombs pretty much have to be touching the dam wall.  THE DAM BUSTERS spares us the mathematics involved, but only just - this is one of those movies that loves to linger over the details, and indulge its obsessive delight with gizmos and how things work.  Character development and interaction take a deep back seat to skip tests and the like.  If you like movies like that - I do - it shouldn't be much of a bother.About 1/3rd of the way in we're introduced to the other major character in this movie.  Richard Todd plays RAF Wing Commander Guy Gibson, VC, DSO, DFC (does anyone know what all those trailing letters stand for?)  Gibson is a gallant flight commander who is chosen to train a hand-picked squadron of men to attack the great dams of Germany - assuming, of course, Dr. Wallis can develop a working model in time.  While the good doctor is perfects his bomb, the fly boys are busy learning tricky new skills, namely low-altitude night flying.If THE DAM BUSTERS isn't so great at developing characters, it's terrific at delivering the details.  One sequence takes us, step-by-step, through a trial run on one of the big Lancasters used to deliver the bomb.  Belts are strapped and buckled, instruments checked and rechecked, engines one through four fired up in sequence.  If scenes like this don't develop characters or build much tension when they're well done - and they're done well here - they put you there.I liked THE DAM BUSTERS quite a bit.  Redgrave is a very good actor, and he doesn't have to stretch much to play the slightly withdrawn and inspired bomb builder.  An old film book of mine described Richard Todd as an ""energetic, if somewhat stiff"" British actor, which seems about right.  Similar British movies of that era, like `Sink the Bismarck,' didn't waste a lot of time away from the charts and maps, either.I'd never heard of this movie before, although I've watched an awful lot of war movies.  I found it through an internet search of Michael Redgrave movies.  As I write this it's available for rental but not purchase, unless you can find a used copy.  Weird.  If I had to hazard a guess why this good film is so buried and scarce nowadays I'd say it has to do with one of the movie's characters.  More specifically, with the character's name.  Todd's wing commander has a hyper-affectionate, coal black lab with an unfortunate name.  It begins with the letter `N,' is an ugly racial epithet that has been rightly banned from broadcast television since television began.  The dog is well-loved, everyone shouts his name in greeting when they see him, and he does get around.  It's tempting to make excuses for a 50-year-old movie, but even if this was the real name of a real dog it's real stupid and tone deaf to use it in a movie.",4,The biography of a bomb,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,3708,"['Michael', 'Redgrave', 'character', '1953', 'based-on-a-true', 'story', 'WWII', 'development', 'deployment', 'bouncing', 'bombs', 'used', 'destroy', 'great', 'dams', 'Germany', 'process', 'cripple', 'industrial', 'capacity', 'thin', 'dividing', 'line', 'inspiration', 'obsession', 'Redgrave', 'slightly', 'potty', 'shack-scientist', 'Dr.', 'Barnes', 'N.', 'Wallis', 'CBE', 'FRS', 'Dr.', 'Wallis', 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'dams', 'are', 'so', 'darn', 'hard', 'blow', 'up', 'theory', 'anyway', 'good', 'third', 'movie', 'convincing', 'powers', 'be', 'let', 'develop', 'practical', 'bomb', 'based', 'theory', 'Conventional', 'attack', 'least', 'Wallis', 'applied', 'considerable', 'intellect', 'challenge', 'had', 'bombs', 'dropped', 'great', 'height', 'slight', 'space', 'away', 'dam', 'wall', 'movie', 'slight', 'space', 'water', 'intervening', 'bomb', 'wall', 'cushion', 'bomb', 'force', 'work', 'bombs', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'be', 'touching', 'dam', 'wall', 'DAM', 'BUSTERS', 'mathematics', 'involved', 'only', 'just', 'one', 'movies', 'linger', 'details', 'indulge', 'obsessive', 'delight', 'gizmos', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'Character', 'development', 'interaction', 'take', 'deep', 'back', 'seat', 'skip', 'tests', 'like', 'like', 'movies', 'do', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'bother.About', '1/3rd', 'way', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'other', 'major', 'character', 'movie', 'Richard', 'Todd', 'RAF', 'Wing', 'Commander', 'Guy', 'Gibson', 'VC', 'DSO', 'DFC', 'anyone', 'know', 'what', 'trailing', 'letters', 'stand', 'Gibson', 'gallant', 'flight', 'commander', 'who', 'chosen', 'train', 'hand-picked', 'squadron', 'men', 'attack', 'great', 'dams', 'Germany', 'assuming', 'course', 'Dr.', 'Wallis', 'can', 'develop', 'working', 'model', 'time', 'good', 'doctor', 'bomb', 'fly', 'boys', 'are', 'busy', 'learning', 'tricky', 'new', 'skills', 'namely', 'low-altitude', 'night', 'THE', 'DAM', 'BUSTERS', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'developing', 'characters', 'terrific', 'delivering', 'details', 'One', 'sequence', 'step-by-step', 'trial', 'run', 'one', 'big', 'Lancasters', 'used', 'deliver', 'bomb', 'Belts', 'are', 'strapped', 'buckled', 'instruments', 'checked', 'rechecked', 'one', 'four', 'fired', 'up', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'develop', 'characters', 'build', 'much', 'tension', 'when', ""'re"", 'well', 'done', ""'re"", 'done', 'well', 'here', 'put', 'there.I', 'liked', 'THE', 'DAM', 'BUSTERS', 'quite', 'bit', 'Redgrave', 'very', 'good', 'actor', ""n't"", 'have', 'stretch', 'much', 'play', 'slightly', 'withdrawn', 'inspired', 'bomb', 'builder', 'old', 'film', 'book', 'mine', 'described', 'Richard', 'Todd', 'energetic', 'somewhat', 'stiff', 'British', 'actor', 'right', 'Similar', 'British', 'movies', 'era', 'Sink', 'Bismarck', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'lot', 'time', 'away', 'charts', 'maps', 'either.I', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'before', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'awful', 'lot', 'war', 'movies', 'found', 'internet', 'search', 'Michael', 'Redgrave', 'movies', 'write', 'available', 'rental', 'not', 'purchase', 'can', 'find', 'used', 'copy', 'Weird', 'had', 'hazard', 'guess', 'why', 'good', 'film', 'so', 'buried', 'scarce', 'nowadays', ""'d"", 'say', 'do', 'one', 'movie', 'characters', 'More', 'specifically', 'character', 'name', 'Todd', 'wing', 'commander', 'hyper-affectionate', 'coal', 'black', 'lab', 'unfortunate', 'name', 'letter', 'N', 'ugly', 'racial', 'epithet', 'been', 'rightly', 'banned', 'broadcast', 'television', 'television', 'began', 'dog', 'well-loved', 'everyone', 'name', 'greeting', 'when', 'see', 'get', 'tempting', 'make', 'excuses', '50-year-old', 'movie', 'even', 'was', 'real', 'name', 'real', 'dog', 'real', 'stupid', 'tone', 'deaf', 'use', 'movie']",Dam Busters
