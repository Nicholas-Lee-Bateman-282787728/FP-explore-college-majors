704205,A1J5B9VM8ZPQPP,B0000687FC,David,"[19, 23]","Another good, sexy, fun softcore romp from Retromedia. Nicole Sheridan and Beverly Lynne end up inheriting an old, western ghost town. But there's an evil landowner nearby who wants to scare her into selling it so that he can get his hands on its legendary lost silver mine. But the ghost of Calamity Kate helps fend him off.Throughout this little adventure, we get six sex scenes. Four are boy/girl, one is girl/girl, and one is girl/girl/girl. The first four were excellent, the final two were okay, but could have been better. The lesbian three way should have been the highlight of the video, but it was one of the weaker scenes. Nicole was in four of the scenes, so this is a really good video for fans of her. Beverly is in two scenes. There were two other girls who were in the girl/girl scene, and they did a great job. Belinda Gavin (aka, Kylie Wyote) is also present, and is in one scene.The other movie on the DVD, Bikini Academy, is barely worth mentioning. I sped through it on fast forward, and it looked really bad, with very little nudity and one very weak sex scene.However, if you've enjoyed past Retromedia releases, or want something that gives you a lot of Nicole Sheridan, this is an easy recommendation.",4,Nicole Sheridan steams up the wild west.,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,1226,"['good', 'sexy', 'fun', 'softcore', 'romp', 'Retromedia', 'Nicole', 'Sheridan', 'Beverly', 'Lynne', 'end', 'up', 'inheriting', 'old', 'western', 'ghost', 'town', 'evil', 'landowner', 'nearby', 'who', 'scare', 'selling', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'legendary', 'lost', 'silver', 'mine', 'ghost', 'Calamity', 'Kate', 'fend', 'off.Throughout', 'little', 'adventure', 'get', 'six', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Four', 'are', 'boy/girl', 'one', 'girl/girl', 'one', 'girl/girl/girl', 'first', 'four', 'were', 'excellent', 'final', 'two', 'were', 'okay', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'lesbian', 'three', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'highlight', 'video', 'was', 'one', 'weaker', 'scenes', 'Nicole', 'was', 'four', 'scenes', 'really', 'good', 'video', 'fans', 'Beverly', 'two', 'scenes', 'were', 'two', 'other', 'girls', 'who', 'were', 'girl/girl', 'scene', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Belinda', 'Gavin', 'aka', 'Kylie', 'Wyote', 'also', 'present', 'one', 'scene.The', 'other', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Bikini', 'Academy', 'barely', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'sped', 'fast', 'forward', 'looked', 'really', 'bad', 'very', 'little', 'nudity', 'one', 'very', 'weak', 'sex', 'scene.However', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Retromedia', 'releases', 'want', 'something', 'lot', 'Nicole', 'Sheridan', 'easy', 'recommendation']",N/A
704206,A2NAHCB4YW70WF,B0000687FC,K. W. Forsythe,"[13, 16]","This whole series of films from Retromedia, of which ""the Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful"" is one, are actually great fun to watch and much better than I expected out of this type of movie. They are soft-core porn films, so there are all the expected nude scenes with beautiful women, love scenes, fake sex scenes, and so forth. Nothing new there. They are very much soft core, so they have none of the explicit hard core type shots, which makes them more viewable by a general audience (these are movies that my girlfriend would sit and watch with me and enjoy). But what makes them interesting is that they actually have a great tongue-in-cheek sense of humor about them.The films don't take themselves too seriously or try to be something other than what they are; which is refreshing. In many of these types of movies, the ""movie"" is usually some really bad filler that tries to just fill in the gap between sex scenes. Not so in this series of movies from Retromedia. The ""filler"" in these movies is actually fun to watch just on it's own merit.The cast in this series of films, which for the most part carries over from film to film, such as Nicole Sheridan and Evan Stone, are obviously having fun doing what they're doing. I was immensely surprised and impressed by Evan Stone, who is a hard core veteran, and the sense of humor and Jim Carrey-ish physical comedy that he brings to these films; who knew?. He's just great fun to watch. Nicole Sheridan, as well as being just beautiful to look at, also is clearly having fun playing some of the silly roles that she plays in the series, such as Jeannie, the ghost in the teeny bikini, and so on.I would highly recommend this whole series of films. ""The Erotic Dreams of Jeannie,"" The Bikini Chain Gang."" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful,"" ""Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet,"" ""Ghost in a Teeny Bikini,"" are all part of this series with much of the same core cast (a few actors differ from film to film). When watched as a group of films together, with the core cast moving from one silly premise to another, you can see the great sense of humor of the cast that comes through time after time.",5,Great fun to watch,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,2155,"['whole', 'series', 'films', 'Retromedia', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Beautiful', 'one', 'are', 'actually', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'out', 'type', 'movie', 'are', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'films', 'are', 'expected', 'nude', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'women', 'love', 'scenes', 'fake', 'sex', 'scenes', 'so', 'forth', 'Nothing', 'new', 'there', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'soft', 'core', 'have', 'none', 'explicit', 'hard', 'core', 'type', 'shots', 'more', 'viewable', 'general', 'audience', 'are', 'movies', 'girlfriend', 'would', 'sit', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'what', 'interesting', 'actually', 'have', 'great', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'sense', 'humor', 'them.The', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'try', 'be', 'something', 'other', 'what', 'are', 'refreshing', 'many', 'types', 'movies', 'movie', 'usually', 'really', 'bad', 'filler', 'just', 'fill', 'gap', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Not', 'so', 'series', 'movies', 'Retromedia', 'filler', 'movies', 'actually', 'fun', 'watch', 'just', 'own', 'merit.The', 'cast', 'series', 'films', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'film', 'such', 'Nicole', 'Sheridan', 'Evan', 'Stone', 'are', 'obviously', 'having', 'fun', 'doing', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'was', 'immensely', 'surprised', 'impressed', 'Evan', 'Stone', 'who', 'hard', 'core', 'veteran', 'sense', 'humor', 'Jim', 'Carrey-ish', 'physical', 'comedy', 'films', 'who', 'knew', 'just', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'Nicole', 'Sheridan', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'just', 'beautiful', 'look', 'also', 'clearly', 'having', 'fun', 'playing', 'silly', 'roles', 'series', 'such', 'Jeannie', 'ghost', 'teeny', 'bikini', 'so', 'on.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'whole', 'series', 'films', 'Erotic', 'Dreams', 'Jeannie', 'Bikini', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Beautiful', 'Bikini', 'Girls', 'Lost', 'Planet', 'Ghost', 'Teeny', 'Bikini', 'are', 'part', 'series', 'much', 'same', 'core', 'cast', 'few', 'actors', 'differ', 'film', 'film', 'When', 'watched', 'group', 'films', 'together', 'core', 'cast', 'moving', 'one', 'silly', 'premise', 'can', 'see', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'cast', 'time', 'time']",N/A

704208,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B0000687FC,The Phantom,"[5, 6]","Of all of the Fred Olen Ray/Nicholas Medina films produced in the last decade, ""The Good, the Bad and the Beautiful"" probably the best, in terms of plot, script, acting and humor.There are quite a few genuine laughs. Evan Stone's character: ""That's the blacksmith shop, where the blacks and the Smiths used to get together and pound nails."" Beverly Lynne's character: ""Jesus..."" Stone: ""No, he didn't like pounding nails.""The movie isn't as good as some Medina flicks in terms of sexiness. The actresses aren't as hot in this one as they are in the others, and the sex is played almost entirely for laughs. Although I must say that the cinematography of the sex scenes is an improvement over most of the rest of the films in this group. One of my biggest complaints about movies of this type is that they never show the females from behind. We actually get a few of those shots in this movie.This is a two-for-one deal because the DVD also comes packaged with ""Babewatch: A Forbidden Parody"" on the flip side. (The packaging indicates that the movie is called ""Bikini Academy"" although I'm not sure why.) And it's basically unwatchably bad, although each of the female characters disrobes at least once. The only one really worth standing up about, though, is the one who you see in the opening shot: Kelli J. Hoffman. Built like a brick house, and she alone makes it worth watching.",4,Entertaining...really!,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,1383,"['Fred', 'Olen', 'Ray/Nicholas', 'Medina', 'films', 'produced', 'last', 'decade', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Beautiful', 'probably', 'best', 'terms', 'plot', 'script', 'acting', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'Evan', 'Stone', 'character', 'blacksmith', 'shop', 'where', 'blacks', 'Smiths', 'used', 'get', 'together', 'pound', 'nails', 'Beverly', 'Lynne', 'character', 'Jesus', 'Stone', 'No', 'did', ""n't"", 'pounding', 'nails', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Medina', 'flicks', 'terms', 'sexiness', 'actresses', 'are', ""n't"", 'hot', 'one', 'are', 'others', 'sex', 'played', 'almost', 'entirely', 'laughs', 'must', 'say', 'cinematography', 'sex', 'scenes', 'improvement', 'most', 'rest', 'films', 'group', 'One', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'movies', 'type', 'never', 'show', 'females', 'actually', 'get', 'few', 'shots', 'movie.This', 'two-for-one', 'deal', 'DVD', 'also', 'packaged', 'Babewatch', 'Forbidden', 'Parody', 'flip', 'side', 'packaging', 'movie', 'called', 'Bikini', 'Academy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'basically', 'unwatchably', 'bad', 'female', 'characters', 'disrobes', 'least', 'once', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'worth', 'standing', 'up', 'about', 'one', 'who', 'see', 'opening', 'shot', 'Kelli', 'J.', 'Hoffman', 'Built', 'brick', 'house', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
