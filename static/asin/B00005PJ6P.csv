673280,A3RX6E9EP1J5WW,B00005PJ6P,A Christy,"[1, 1]","Many people have strong feelings about this movie because it is quite different from the original novel. Yes, it is. But that novel could never be made into a movie that anyone would watch. It would consiste of two hours of watching someone sit in a room and think silently with about 2 minutes of actual activity. Really.So, rather than berate this because it isn't the novel, I'd instead like to review it as a movie. All by itself. So, I will try to NOT reference what I know from the novel as an explanation of what is going on in the movie.In this tale, we are in a near future where something ""bad"" has happened in the past. We know this because even though there are houses and streets and cars and shops, there are also guards in black, road blocks and women dressed in only three colors: white, red or blue. In this dystopian future the majority of the world is now sterile or has very low reproductive ability and the world has shifted to a patriarchal rule in which women are both despised and worshipped, but always controlled. We get the impression, but never the outright knowledge, that some war in the past has contaminated humanity and that the Republic of Gideon, once a part of the United States, is assuming control and assuring future prosperity by taking a firm hand of things. (Of course, in the book I know more but this is the movie.)Our main character is Offred, a woman who is fertile and therefore an asset that must be allocated, used and controlled. She is a Red who has been allocated to a Commander (all males in power) and his wife, a Blue by the name of Serena. Her role is to bear a child for them. It is both horrifying and heart-wrenching to see how this is supposed to come about. But if being a Red like Offred is bad, then NOT being a Red is even worse. A secondary character, Moira, pops up now and again and we get to see one of the ways in which those that are fertile but not obedient are disposed of. If I say more I'll start ruining the story for those who haven't seen it yet, so we'll leave it there.With the caveat in mind that this is NOT the book, but rather a more visual rendering of the basic premise of the book, I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. While we don't get the same level of back story in how Gilead is formed or the full perspective of Offred's life as a free woman before she was captured to be a Red and we get a very neat ending, we do get the emotional punch. We get the gist and we get the morality question.When I watched this with a friend who had never seen it before she, a very liberal sort of person, said that she had a hard time enjoying it because it was so unbelievable. That it could never happen here. That is the point. If you think very carefully about it, what would it take to make that happen anywhere this now relatively ""free"". It wouldn't take much. In this case, much of the country is contaminated with radiation and toxicity that has rendered so much sterile. Not just people but land and animals. Resources are hard to get to in such a world. How much restriction in such would be needed before someone had the bright idea to ""control"" everything for the ""common good"" of all.It wouldn't take much. It took just one terrorist attack here to remove our basic freedom in exchange for the illusion of safety...which we don't have. Dystopias are born of good intentions corrupted by human nature. Yes, that's my quote and it is a truth. I think that is the lesson behind this movie. While this one focuses on the very obvious restriction and slavery of Red women, who in there is really free? No one. Even the ones who think they are in control are themselves slaves to the horror they have created. All freedoms can be exchanged for these Red women though in a similar story.Great morality tale with some mature content, it should be watched by parents before letting kids at it. Highly recommended for those who like dystopian films it's a sure conversation starter.",4,"Varies From the Novel, But Great Movie Nonetheless",1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,3972,"['Many', 'people', 'have', 'strong', 'feelings', 'movie', 'quite', 'different', 'original', 'novel', 'Yes', 'novel', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'movie', 'anyone', 'would', 'watch', 'would', 'consiste', 'two', 'hours', 'watching', 'someone', 'sit', 'room', 'think', 'silently', '2', 'minutes', 'actual', 'activity', 'Really.So', 'rather', 'berate', ""n't"", 'novel', ""'d"", 'instead', 'like', 'review', 'movie', 'So', 'will', 'try', 'NOT', 'reference', 'what', 'know', 'novel', 'explanation', 'what', 'going', 'movie.In', 'tale', 'are', 'near', 'future', 'where', 'something', 'bad', 'happened', 'past', 'know', 'even', 'are', 'houses', 'streets', 'cars', 'shops', 'are', 'also', 'guards', 'black', 'road', 'blocks', 'women', 'dressed', 'only', 'three', 'colors', 'white', 'red', 'blue', 'dystopian', 'future', 'majority', 'world', 'now', 'sterile', 'very', 'low', 'reproductive', 'ability', 'world', 'shifted', 'patriarchal', 'rule', 'women', 'are', 'despised', 'worshipped', 'always', 'controlled', 'get', 'impression', 'never', 'outright', 'knowledge', 'war', 'past', 'contaminated', 'humanity', 'Republic', 'Gideon', 'once', 'part', 'United', 'States', 'assuming', 'control', 'assuring', 'future', 'prosperity', 'taking', 'firm', 'hand', 'things', 'course', 'book', 'know', 'more', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Offred', 'woman', 'who', 'fertile', 'therefore', 'asset', 'must', 'be', 'allocated', 'used', 'controlled', 'Red', 'who', 'been', 'allocated', 'Commander', 'males', 'power', 'wife', 'Blue', 'name', 'Serena', 'role', 'bear', 'child', 'horrifying', 'heart-wrenching', 'see', 'how', 'supposed', 'come', 'about', 'being', 'Red', 'Offred', 'bad', 'then', 'NOT', 'being', 'Red', 'even', 'worse', 'secondary', 'character', 'Moira', 'up', 'now', 'again', 'get', 'see', 'one', 'ways', 'are', 'fertile', 'not', 'obedient', 'are', 'disposed', 'say', 'more', ""'ll"", 'start', 'ruining', 'story', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'caveat', 'mind', 'NOT', 'book', 'rather', 'more', 'visual', 'rendering', 'basic', 'premise', 'book', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'level', 'back', 'story', 'how', 'Gilead', 'formed', 'full', 'perspective', 'Offred', 'life', 'free', 'woman', 'was', 'captured', 'be', 'Red', 'get', 'very', 'neat', 'ending', 'do', 'get', 'emotional', 'punch', 'get', 'gist', 'get', 'morality', 'question.When', 'watched', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'very', 'liberal', 'sort', 'person', 'said', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'enjoying', 'was', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'could', 'never', 'happen', 'here', 'point', 'think', 'very', 'carefully', 'what', 'would', 'take', 'make', 'happen', 'anywhere', 'now', 'relatively', 'free', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'case', 'much', 'country', 'contaminated', 'radiation', 'toxicity', 'rendered', 'so', 'much', 'sterile', 'Not', 'just', 'people', 'land', 'animals', 'Resources', 'are', 'hard', 'get', 'world', 'How', 'much', 'restriction', 'such', 'would', 'be', 'needed', 'someone', 'had', 'bright', 'idea', 'control', 'everything', 'common', 'good', 'all.It', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'took', 'just', 'one', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'here', 'remove', 'basic', 'freedom', 'exchange', 'illusion', 'safety', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Dystopias', 'are', 'born', 'good', 'intentions', 'corrupted', 'human', 'nature', 'Yes', 'quote', 'truth', 'think', 'lesson', 'movie', 'one', 'very', 'obvious', 'restriction', 'slavery', 'Red', 'women', 'who', 'really', 'free', 'one', 'Even', 'ones', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'control', 'are', 'horror', 'have', 'created', 'freedoms', 'can', 'be', 'exchanged', 'Red', 'women', 'similar', 'story.Great', 'morality', 'tale', 'mature', 'content', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'parents', 'letting', 'kids', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'like', 'dystopian', 'films', 'sure', 'conversation', 'starter']",N/A

McLeod,"[6, 25]","The Handmaid's Tale spins a limply dystopian tale projecting the horrors that would come about were a misogynist Christian cult to rule the country.  Although the concept of widespread infertility due to pollution and the resulting enslavement of fertile women is intriguing, this movie really fails to capitalize on the possibilities.  Rather than explore the Orwellian experience of fear and isolation, the viewer is fed a depressing load of leftist propaganda about the dangers of people who own a Bible.  Strong acting and a captivating story may have been able to distract from the impression that you're watching a commercial for Planned Parenthood, but sadly the film has neither of these.  Instead, we're treated to (read: asked to endure) an acting performance from Natasha Richardson the caliber of which hasn't been seen since I got rid of my Darth Vader carboard stand-up in college.The end result of your 2 hour investment are the life-changing realizations that men are bad, Christians are bad, and Robert Duvall has been in some movies of really shaky quality.

Houzet ""wozamoya""","[7, 16]","What most of the arch-liberals commenting on this film here seem to completely miss is that the state religion depicted in this movie is not representative of Christianity. But I am not surprised anymore by ignorant people harping on about the USA already being ""controlled by Christian fundamentalists"" or the ""shock horror"" of such coming to pass.Anyway, for anyone who cares to notice, the insignia (eye and pyramid) of the movie's Republic of Gilead (located somewhere in present day America) is what is commonly known as the sign of the Freemasons secret society as well as the New Age movement. Thus the Gilead in the movie is really a depiction of what could happen if a secret society with all its intra-society obligations and weird rituals, or the ever pervasive New Age movement with its own dogma, took control, politically, socially and militarily. Obviously, elements of Taliban or Iran-like regimes are also depicted, particularly regarding the subjugation of women.Take note of the background news flashes throughout the movie - references to the war on the borders, insurgencies by Southern Baptist guerillas (!); but all carefully sanitized news pointing to state media control as was prevalent in the Soviet Bloc and is still present in many dictatorships today.I don't really care about Margaret Atwood's ""original intent"" or the lefties' interpretations of her work. This movie was intriguing and enjoyable for its portrayal of the desire for freedom (personal, social, religious) that runs fiercely in any human being that cares. It's interesting that this movie came out the same year as Not Without My Daughter, based on the real-life experiences of an American woman trapped by her marriage to a Muslim in oppressive Iran.This is the first movie I saw starring Nathasha Richardson, and she captivated me.

673291,AISSRJ7E2L375,B00005PJ6P,"Kelly Garbato ""Marchpane!""","[8, 10]","If you've never read Margaret Atwood's THE HANDMAID'S TALE, the 1990 film adaptation by Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff might seem an interesting enough movie. Set in a future in which Christian fundamentalists have overthrown the government, the film paints a terrifying picture of an American theocracy. Women, homosexuals, religious minorities, people of color, political dissidents - all suffer under the oppressive thumb of The Republic of Gilead.Those familiar with the 1985 novel will see that much of the basic story remains the same in Schl&ouml;ndorff's on-screen adaptation. The former United States is in the midst of a Civil War; The Republic of Gilead holds much of the East Coast, while dissenting religious and secular groups wage war to the South and West. Within the Republic's borders, a strict social structure is enforced. Men are ranked according to prestige and merit (Commanders, Eyes, Angels, Guardians, and businessmen and professionals), while women are grouped according to social function, which is primarily determined by their reproductive health and racial makeup (Aunts, Wives and Daughters, Econowives, Handmaids, Marthas, and Unwomen). While no Gileadean citizen is truly free, it is the females who bear the brunt of Gilead's religious tyranny.It is in this context that we meet Kate (Offred), a Handmaid who has been assigned to Commander Fred (""Of Fred"") and his Wife, Serena Joy. THE HANDMAID'S TALE is Kate's tale, told in her very own voice, through a disjointed series of flashbacks and present-day narrations. Through Kate's eyes, we reflect upon ""the days before""; we learn how the Sons of Jacob were able to destabilize and eventually topple the American government and institute their own patriarchal theocracy; and we get a glimpse of what daily life in the Republic is like.Overall, the film retains the tone of the Atwood's story. It's all there: Kate's re-education at The Red Center; the Birthing Ceremony, Prayvaganza, and Women's Salvaging and Particicution; trips to the gynecologist; illicit visits to the Commander's office; the night out at Jezebel's; and, of course, the monthly rape Ceremonies. The acting is solid enough: Natasha Richardson (as Kate), Faye Dunaway (Serena Joy), and Elizabeth McGovern (Moira) are the cast's standouts, though Aidan Quinn (Nick) and Robert Duvall (the Commander) leave something to be desired. The visuals really steal the movie; it's incredible to see Atwood's story take form on-screen. (My favorite prop is a livestock trailer used to transport women to and from the Red Center.) Altogether, it makes for a terrifying dystopian sci fi film...that is, if you haven't yet been ""spoiled"" by the novel.While the movie does follow the basic plot of THE HANDMAID'S TALE, the filmmakers change a number of small, seemingly insignificant details. Upon closer examination, many of these minor points are actually quite important, and their alteration impacts the story in unanticipated ways, both on an individual and collective level.The most drastic change comes from the costume department. The citizens of Gilead are all required to wear uniforms which reflect their place in the social hierarchy. Men largely don military-type uniforms, while women wear dresses of various colors: brown for Aunts, blue for Wives, black for Widows, and white for Daughters; dresses striped red, blue, and green for Econowives; red habits with white headresses (""Wings"") for Handmaids; green smocks for Marthas; gray dresses for Unwomen; and revealing vintage contraband (think Playboy bunnies and cheerleaders) for Jezebels. These outfits can be seen in the film, but with modifications.Take the Handmaid's uniform, for example. As envisioned by Atwood, the Handmaid's habit (a type of sack-like dress) is almost as concealing as an Islamic burqa: it covers the Handmaid from her wrists to her ankles. She also wears red gloves and stockings, so that the only pieces of flesh that are visible are her neck and face - and even those are somewhat obscured, what with the red veil and white headdress. Underneath her scarlet red habit is a white cotton underdress and bulky, oversized underwear. During the hot summers, she switches to a habit made of lighter material, but it's no more revealing than her winter wardrobe.In comparison, the uniform worn by Natasha Richardson is relatively immodest: the hem of the habit ends mid-shin, revealing precious inches of the Handmaid's legs to hungry, sex-starved men, while the thin material gives an outline of the womanly shape beneath. Scandalous!Worse still, there are no Wings atop Richardson's head! The Handmaid's headdress conceals her face from the prying eyes of the world - and the world from her prying eyes (much like a horse's blinders). The Wings keep Handmaids ignorant, innocent, submissive. They're an essential part of the uniform, and yet they are completely absent in the movie. I understand why; blinders must make filming an actor's facial expressions quite a difficult task, natch. Still, that's the point of the Wings - they're a tool of subjugation, keeping the wearer unaware of her very surroundings.Even the visual difference between a Handmaid-with-Wings and a Handmaid-without-Wings is striking.The Handmaid's isn't the only outfit that's been fiddled with. Serena Joy, too, can be seen wearing a dress that's much more revealing than Gilead's strict, Puritanical, anti-sex dress code would ever allow. While the Wives don't seem to have a singular uniform - any modest blue dress will do - it's a given that the dress shouldn't show too much skin. Yet, at one point, you can actually catch a glimpse of Faye Dunaway's cleavage - as if!Casual filmgoers might not place much importance on these changes - but they are significant. The Republic of Gilead is an oppressive, misogynistic, uber-conservative society. Every aspect of the culture feeds into this Biblically-based repression, right down the the mandated uniforms. Given the many functions of clothing - separating citizens into rank and social function, concealing the female form, further subjugating the Handmaids in particular - you might even say that the clothing is an uncredited star of THE HANDMAID'S TALE. Or rather, it should be; in altering the clothing, the filmmakers have undermined its importance. Consequently, they have removed an especially oppressive aspect of Gilead's regime.These ""minor"" changes only begin with the costumes. Like the clothing, many of these details implicitly or explicitly speak to the treatment of women, and in so changing these minutiae, the filmmakers detract from the feeling of stifling oppression faced by Gilead's female population.* Women move about (relatively) freely, belying the government's actual constraints on women described so starkly in the novel.* Commander Fred's Bible isn't secured under lock and key, but is kept out on a podium, where any uppity woman might find it.* In the film, Commander Fred is Kate's first placement, not her third, thereby reducing the pressure on her to succeed in bearing a child.* When Kate visits the doctor (gynecologist), the sheet separating Kate's face from her torso is gone, thereby allowing the doctor to (gasp!) look her in the eyes (and otherwise interact with her on a personal level) as he pokes and prods her naked body.* During the initial Ceremony/rape scene, it is Offred who is crying, while Serena remains stone-faced and silent. In Atwood's version, the roles are reversed; consequently, the fundamentalist Serena is shown regretting at least one aspect of the society she fought for, while Kate once again appears detached from her body.* The Birthing Ceremony is short one Birth Chair and, even more glaringly, Ofwarren is allowed to handle the baby afterwards. This is in contrast to the novel, where the Wife is the center of attention, to the point where her fellow party-goers act as though it is she, and not her Handmaid, who gave birth to the baby. (This sequence is quite the spectacle.)The initial sitting room scene between Kate and Nick also undergoes a seemingly small change that in actuality alters the entire dynamic of the sequence - and their relationship throughout the film. In this scene, Kate sneaks out of her room late one night and steals away to Serena Joy's sitting room. She wants to explore her surroundings, taste a scrap of freedom, maybe even steal a small keepsake, something that won't be missed. Nick, meanwhile, has been sent by the Commander to find Kate and arrange for her to meet the Commander the following night in his office. The two interlopers, having stumbled upon one another in the moonlight, share a brief but hungry kiss.Where the novel and film differ is in the following exchange. While Nick explains the Commander's wishes to Kate, they remain in a furtive embrace. In Atwood's imagination, Nick strokes Kate's arm as he talks; Schl&ouml;ndorff has Nick groping Kate's breast. Schl&ouml;ndorff's version throws off the power balance, making Nick seem more like a creepy pervert, taking advantage of his Commander's Handmaid. Correspondingly, Kate as played by Richardson seems less like a willing participant in the exchange and more like a victim of sexual assault, so submissive and subjugated that she's been conditioned to accept the manhandling of strangers. (Which may very well be the case, but it's not indicative of the kiss, nor of their subsequent relationship.)In reality, this is a mutually desired interaction (and, later, a mutually desired relationship). Kate and Nick both suffer under Gilead (though Kate more so than Nick), and their relationship is a brief respite from the stifling oppression of their daily existence. The affair also offers them a small sense of control in a world in which they have none. They are dissidents, deviants, criminals, brought together by lust and loneliness. Unlike most of Gilead's arranged and prescribed human relationships, theirs is genuine - a sentiment that Schl&ouml;ndorff fails to convey.These are but a few of the many changes foisted upon Atwood's novel during its metamorphosis to screenplay. Others are equally puzzling but don't fundamentally alter the tenor of the story. Moira, for instance, is introduced as Kate's newfound friend from The Red Center rather than her best friend from college. Later, Kate is shown aiding Moira in her escape from The Red Center, even though she was as surprised as everyone else when Moira turned up missing. During Kate's assignment to Commander Fred's household, he leaves town, and so Serena sends Kate back to The Red Center during his absence (so poor Serena won't have to suffer the Handmaid for naught). This struck me as an especially odd invention, since it was also somewhat unnecessary.Even the casting is a little puzzling. I found it odd, for instance, that a brunette Faye Dunaway was cast as the blond Serena Joy, and a blond Natasha Richardson plays a brunette Kate. The significance of the characters' hair color isn't in stereotypes about blonds and brunettes, but it does go to Serena Joy's character (and hypocrisy therein): in noting Serena's hair color, Kate comments that, in ""the days before"", she naturally assumed that Serena's blondness came from a bottle. Because, well, that's the type of Christian Serena Joy was/is: do as I say, not as I do. (""Women who work outside the home are selfish, except for me; I'm making a sacrifice for the greater good. Women should not be vain and overly concerned with their looks, but hey, I'm on teevee!"") Seriously, could they not have dyed the actors' hair?The most substantial change comes at the film's end. The novel is presented as a series of disjointed flashbacks and seemingly present-day narration; we later learn that it's all a series of recollections. THE HANDMAID'S TALEs are just that, a series of tales, with no apparent beginning (just the vague ""the days before"") and no real end, since we don't know what became of Kate (or Gilead, even, just that it eventually fell). In contrast, the film is told as a story, with a discrete beginning and end. And what an end: before her escape, Kate kills the Commander, and then is whisked away to the Western frontier by the May Day group. At film's end, we see a very pregnant Kate hiding out in a camper in the mountains, riding out the Civil War. As far as Hollywood endings go, it's not completely wrapped up, but when you compare it to Atwood's grim conclusion, the movie ending looks downright rosy.Cumulatively, the ""minor"" changes represent a significant deviation from Atwood's story - and the sanitized Hollywood ending is an abomination. Consequently, THE HANDMAID'S TALE is a dark film, but nowhere near as terrifying, oppressive and believable as the novel. If it had been crafted from an original script, I'd probably quite enjoy it - four stars, maybe? But knowing what it could have been, I'm somewhat disappointed in the on-screen outcome.Which leaves me hoping that Joss Whedon will soon shoot a remake.

The novel is set in The Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States, or at least the parts of the US that are not radioactive. The radioactive parts are called the colonies, where bad girls are sent to die of radiation poisoning. The time is the near future, after the inevitable nuclear war, and the breakdown of government as we know it.The society depicted in The Handmaid's Tale, DVD and novel, is a nightmare: everyone is watched by the Eyes, ,women are strictly controlled. They are forbidden to have jobs. They may have no money of their own. They are irrevocably assigned to classes.. There are, at the top, the chaste, but morally superior, Wives, almost all of whom have been rendered infertile by the inevitable nuclear war. At the bottom are the housekeepers, or Marthas, who are non-entities. In the middle are the Handmaids of the title, who are fertile, but tightly controlled.Handmaids are forced to have sex with the Commanders, the husbands of the Wives. During this sex, the Wives are intimately present to take in any ""love"" their Commanders have to give.The Handmaids are trained to remain unattached to the Commanders. They are prohibited from using makeup or doing anything to make themselves attractive. Handmaids are forced to turn their offspring over to the Wives. And Handmaids are never taught to read. They are left illiterate.Kate is a Handmaid who, despite her training (read brainwashing), recalls her past, her loving husband, and her adored daughter. She tells with sparkling, and terrifying clarity, how the society came to be the way it is.The governmental aspect of the story is instructive, but that part of the novel is almost entirely missing from the DVD.The government is totalitarian and monotheistic. The one god is very strict, and has His Eyes everywhere. Robert Duvall, in the role of a Commander into whose home Kate is introduced, gives a Bible reading performance on this DVD that will chill the truly religious to the core.Kate's personal story is heartrending. It reminds one of the miseries of, say, the women of Darfur. When the government breaks down, she and her husband and daughter attempt to flee to Canada. Unfortunately, they are caught. Her daughter is ""confiscated."" Her husband is taken away. She never sees her husband again.Her ""training"" is depicted in gory detail, which is more vivid on the screen than in the book.The DVD is a must-see for anyone who cares about women's rights.",5,A Dark Fantasy Worth Watching,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,2567,"['Margaret', 'Atwood', 'Canadian', 'novelist', 'poet', 'wrote', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'novel', 'DVD', 'loosely', 'based', 'novel', 'set', 'Republic', 'Gilead', 'formerly', 'United', 'States', 'least', 'parts', 'US', 'are', 'not', 'radioactive', 'radioactive', 'parts', 'are', 'called', 'colonies', 'where', 'bad', 'girls', 'are', 'sent', 'die', 'radiation', 'poisoning', 'time', 'near', 'future', 'inevitable', 'nuclear', 'war', 'breakdown', 'government', 'know', 'it.The', 'society', 'depicted', 'Handmaid', 'Tale', 'DVD', 'novel', 'nightmare', 'everyone', 'watched', 'Eyes', 'women', 'are', 'strictly', 'controlled', 'are', 'forbidden', 'have', 'jobs', 'may', 'have', 'money', 'own', 'are', 'irrevocably', 'assigned', 'classes..', 'are', 'top', 'chaste', 'morally', 'superior', 'almost', 'whom', 'have', 'been', 'rendered', 'infertile', 'inevitable', 'nuclear', 'war', 'bottom', 'are', 'housekeepers', 'Marthas', 'who', 'are', 'non-entities', 'middle', 'are', 'Handmaids', 'title', 'who', 'are', 'fertile', 'tightly', 'controlled.Handmaids', 'are', 'forced', 'have', 'sex', 'Commanders', 'husbands', 'Wives', 'sex', 'Wives', 'are', 'intimately', 'present', 'take', 'love', 'Commanders', 'have', 'give.The', 'Handmaids', 'are', 'trained', 'remain', 'unattached', 'Commanders', 'are', 'prohibited', 'using', 'makeup', 'doing', 'anything', 'make', 'attractive', 'Handmaids', 'are', 'forced', 'turn', 'offspring', 'Wives', 'Handmaids', 'are', 'never', 'taught', 'read', 'are', 'left', 'illiterate.Kate', 'Handmaid', 'who', 'training', 'read', 'brainwashing', 'past', 'loving', 'husband', 'adored', 'daughter', 'sparkling', 'terrifying', 'clarity', 'how', 'society', 'came', 'be', 'way', 'governmental', 'aspect', 'story', 'instructive', 'part', 'novel', 'almost', 'entirely', 'missing', 'DVD.The', 'government', 'totalitarian', 'monotheistic', 'one', 'god', 'very', 'strict', 'Eyes', 'everywhere', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'role', 'Commander', 'home', 'Kate', 'introduced', 'Bible', 'reading', 'performance', 'DVD', 'will', 'chill', 'truly', 'religious', 'core.Kate', 'personal', 'story', 'heartrending', 'one', 'miseries', 'say', 'women', 'Darfur', 'When', 'government', 'breaks', 'down', 'husband', 'daughter', 'attempt', 'flee', 'Canada', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'caught', 'daughter', 'confiscated', 'husband', 'taken', 'away', 'never', 'husband', 'training', 'depicted', 'gory', 'detail', 'more', 'vivid', 'screen', 'book.The', 'DVD', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'who', 'women', 'rights']",N/A
673296,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00005PJ6P,Melissa Niksic,"[1, 2]","Although the film adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel ""The Handmaid's Tale"" features a very strong cast, it was a big disappointment to me. As someone who really enjoyed the book, I thought that a lot of Atwood's story was lost on the big screen.The plot revolves around a martial law society that dictates fertile young women are to be captured and forced to work as handmaids/baby mommas for the rich and childless. Kate (Natasha Richardson) is one of the women captured and is renamed Offred. She serves in the home of a military commander (Robert Duvall) and his extremely bitter wife (Faye Dunaway). Kate's mission is to get knocked up as soon as possible, but her living situation is complicated when the Commander begins to take more of a personal interest in her than she (or the Commander's wife) would like. Desperate to escape and reunite with her lost daughter, Kate befriends Nick (Aidan Quinn), one of the Commander's security guards, and they make plans to run away together.The biggest problem with the film is that so much of Kate's future is given away within the first ten minutes of the movie. The book is much more suspenseful, and it's also much more horrific and terrifying. Also, the ending of the film is considerably more uplifting than the end of the book, and I think that takes away from the heart of Atwood's story.

673297,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B00005PJ6P,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[119, 136]","I first read Margaret Atwood's book The Handmaid's Tale for a women's studies course at my local community college and I enjoyed it very much. It is a very important work, much in the same vein as Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; but more hopeful, and told from the perspective of a woman. However, the movie was a huge disappointment and loses much of Atwood's message.A quick overview of the story: Offred is a Handmaid in a futuristic, dystopian society known as Gilead. The birthrate in Gilead is very low due to severe toxic pollution, and so the remaining fertile women are selected to be Handmaids whose sole purpose is to become pregnant by the upper class men (called Commanders). As soon as they provide their Commander with a child, they are packed off to another household to do it all again. If they are ever unable to bear more children, they will more than likely be labeled &quot;Unwomen&quot; and shipped away to a work colony to die. Handmaids are not allowed to read, and can only leave the house with permission. The book consists mostly of Offred's thoughts about her former life and her current position. There are hints of a resistance movement, but no one in this world can ever be sure that anyone else is trustworthy. Offred does not know what is real, or what is safe, and lives in constant fear. The regime has made it illegal for a man to be termed infertile, so if a Handmaid has no children, it is blamed on her without question. Offred's Commander is obviously incapable of fathering children, and she faces relocation to the colonies if she does not conceive. As her time runs out, the suspense builds to a crescendo of urgency and terror.The film does not capture the full horror of the world Offred, the story's main character, lives in. In the movie she appears to have almost unrestricted freedom of movement, able to wander about the house and even leave it without permission (for example, she just trots off to the Red Center one day and spends the night - this never happened in the original story), whereas in the book she was monitored constantly. There is also absolutely no reference to the Handmaids not being allowed to read, so a viewer that has not read the book would likely wonder at the significance of the scene where the Commander presents Offred with a magazine as a gift. Offred also smiles quite often in the movie, and there are no allusions to her frequent thoughts of suicide, which are readily apparent in the novel.My biggest disappointment with the movie, however, was the altered ending. Atwood's book leaves us wondering, and actually gives the reader the task of creating the end of the story themself through the way they choose to live their life. The movie, however, provides us with a very neat, tidy, pretty little ending that allows the viewer to forget all about the characters without a twinge of conscience - they're obviously ok, right? So what's that got to do with my life? The movie ending does nothing to make the viewer think or realize that if we aren't careful right here and now in our own lives, everything might not turn out so prettily. There is no lesson, or moral to the story, when Atwood very plainly intended for her work to pack a real punch.I really don't think the novel is even a good candidate for adaptation into a movie, because the book is very slow, centering mostly around Offred's thoughts. She cannot do much, so most of the time she just sits in her room, and it is her contemplations during this time that make up the bulk of the writing. It would be very hard to accurately represent the novel in film without making the movie boring. The director of this film obviously realized this and so he spiced it up and tried to make it into an action movie. It just doesn't work.To make matters worse, the acting in the film is very wooden. Natasha Richardson, who plays the main character, is particularly unconvincing. It is hard to feel for the characters because they just don't seem real. The whole atmosphere of the film is stiff and unnatural.Nevertheless, before I close, I would like to point out the few things I actually did like about the movie (and hence why I'm giving it two stars rather than just one):The scene depicting the monthly &quot;ceremony&quot; is particularly moving. It is rather hard to watch, but I believe it really captures the event as described in the novel. I particularly liked the fact that the camera focuses for a moment on Serena Joy at the end of the scene, showing her emotions as the Wife - something we don't get so much of in the novel.The movie also does a good job of showing the relationship between Offred and the Commander. The viewer can easily see that the Commander sees Offred as a pet - something fun to play with and indulge, but nothing he really cares about. She is like a toy for him, and one that can easily be replaced, just as Offred has replaced the Handmaid before her.Overall, though, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It just doesn't convey the message that Atwood intended, and it's not even very entertaining in and of itself. Read the book instead. You'll get so much more out of it.",2,Very poor adaptation of an excellent novel...,1071014400,"12 10, 2003",2003,5156,"['first', 'read', 'Margaret', 'Atwood', 'book', 'Handmaid', 'Tale', 'women',

It is the feelings that count, and Volker Schlondorf managed to capture this atmosphere of Gilead in his film. The casting was brilliant and highly effective.

Issues of gender, religious ""fundamentalism"", and personal freedom/autonomy play a large part in constructing the film.  Moreover, post-apocalyptic themes (the prominent role of procreation, for example) mingle with authoritarian/big-brother ones, creating a rather compelling and apt atmosphere in our own controversial times (though the book was published in 1986 and the movie was released in 1990).In terms of the film itself, as I mentioned before, it is visually flat.  Scenes are industrial and muted (black and gray cars; desolate, industrial scenes, and a shunning of panaromic shots), contrasting with the garb of the women (blue for the wealthy wives, red for the handmaids).  There are only a few shots that bring any depth to the film, with a result that the color scheme seems overused and pedestrian.The acting is good, with Duvall bringing some complexity to his character.  Unfortunately, Natasha Richardson doesn't bring much to her character, only shining periodically through the film.  She seems neither overwhelmed nor angered by what is happening to her in the story.  While there are excellent scenes by all of the actors and actresses, there just don't seem to be enough of them.For myself, the real value of the film is not the cinematography or the acting, but the ways in which it makes one consider the present and the future.

673302,A264UCDZZ6RLDN,B00005PJ6P,Russell de Ville,"[3, 6]","No, I haven't had a chance yet to read the novel by Canadian Authoress Margaret Atwood, though I'm now inclined to do so. I understand it's become a minor cult classic; so should the film also be.I first saw 'The Handmaid's Tale' a few years ago, late at night on some obscure cable channel on TV. It reminded me of films like 'Logan's Run' and 'Fahrenheit 451' with their respective cheezy music, plastic sets, cinder-block/plywood locations, and costumes pulled from the Goodwill racks. Not that I entirely mind that, however. The films of fantasy and science fiction and allegory that I appreciate most are the ones that are character driven. No matter that Forbidden Planet appears so ""fakey"" to us today, it's still one of the better renditions of Shakespeare's `The Tempest' extant. It's all about adjusting to the curve and developing those survival skills, don't you know?I like this film, though it still makes me most uncomfortable. Perhaps it's the blatant misogyny and the renewal of the patriarchal society in order to implement fascist-conservative values and perpetuate the species (!). Add also the almost constant reminders of the confinement behind barricade and barbed-wire, the incessant intimidation of sweeping spotlights, or the men-all-in-black with weapons abundant. Perhaps it's the fact that food is rationed, movement is restricted, and words and behaviors are scrutinized most precisely. Racism could have been a big thing. The Commander (Robert Duvall) made allusion to it once and then let it go. It's a very White film.Are the men-folk really in charge? Probably not. Personally, I'm more startled by the power and control wielded by Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway), the Commander's wife, or Aunt Lydia (Victoria Tennent), Instructor, Mentor and Washer of Brains. Even the ""Marthas"" in the Commander's kitchens resonate with knowledge of their superior position. That our heroine Kate (Natasha Richardson), or our tragic gender-criminal/temptress Moira (Elizabeth McGovern) demand of themselves the strength and seek the means to reject to all this both astounds and encourages me. The Men (both Aidan Quinn and Duvall) are decidedly secondary figures: After all, except for that little matter of reproduction, ""Who needs a Man?""The Handmaid's Tale is comprised of a top-flight cast who has submitted to Director Schlondorff's carefully blended combination of quasi-futuristic angst and the familiar. I believe they saw the inherent worth in putting this effort to the screen, probably knowing it would not really register with the masses.I think I can live with Three Stars.Russell de Ville14 September 2006",3,The Future We Don't Want To See,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,2634,"['have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'yet', 'read', 'novel', 'Canadian', 'Authoress', 'Margaret', 'Atwood', ""'m"", 'now', 'inclined', 'do', 'so', 'understand', 'become', 'minor', 'cult', 'classic', 'so', 'should', 'film', 'also', 'be.I', 'first', 'saw', ""'The"", 'Handmaid', 'Tale', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'late', 'night', 'obscure', 'cable', 'channel', 'TV', 'reminded', 'films', ""'Logan"", 'Run', '451', 'respective', 'cheezy', 'music', 'plastic', 'sets', 'cinder-block/plywood', 'locations', 'costumes', 'pulled', 'Goodwill', 'racks', 'Not', 'entirely', 'mind', 'however', 'films', 'fantasy', 'science', 'fiction', 'allegory', 'appreciate', 'most', 'are', 'ones', 'are', 'character', 'driven', 'No', 'matter', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', 'so', 'fakey', 'today', 'still', 'one', 'better', 'renditions', 'Shakespeare', 'Tempest', 'extant', 'adjusting', 'curve', 'developing', 'survival', 'skills', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'still', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'Perhaps', 'blatant', 'misogyny', 'renewal', 'patriarchal', 'society', 'order', 'implement', 'fascist-conservative', 'values', 'perpetuate', 'species', 'Add', 'also', 'almost', 'constant', 'reminders', 'confinement', 'barricade', 'barbed-wire', 'incessant', 'intimidation', 'sweeping', 'spotlights', 'men-all-in-black', 'weapons', 'abundant', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'food', 'rationed', 'movement', 'restricted', 'words', 'behaviors', 'are', 'scrutinized', 'most', 'precisely', 'Racism', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'thing', 'Commander', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'made', 'allusion', 'once', 'then', 'let', 'go', 'very', 'White', 'film.Are', 'men-folk', 'really', 'charge', 'Probably', 'not', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'more', 'startled', 'power', 'control', 'wielded', 'Serena', 'Joy', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Commander', 'wife', 'Aunt', 'Lydia', 'Victoria', 'Tennent', 'Instructor', 'Mentor', 'Washer', 'Brains', 'Even', 'Marthas', 'Commander', 'kitchens', 'resonate', 'knowledge', 'superior', 'position', 'heroine', 'Kate', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'tragic', 'gender-criminal/temptress', 'Moira', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'demand', 'strength', 'seek', 'means', 'reject', 'astounds', 'encourages', 'Men', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Duvall', 'are', 'decidedly', 'secondary', 'figures', 'little', 'matter', 'reproduction', 'Who', 'Man', 'Handmaid', 'Tale', 'comprised', 'top-flight', 'cast', 'who', 'submitted', 'Director', 'Schlondorff', 'carefully', 'blended', 'combination', 'quasi-futuristic', 'angst', 'familiar', 'believe', 'saw', 'inherent', 'worth', 'putting', 'effort', 'screen', 'probably', 'knowing', 'would', 'not', 'really', 'register', 'masses.I', 'think', 'can', 'live', 'Three', 'Stars.Russell', 'Ville14', 'September', '2006']",N/A

Like Huxley's Brave New World, it is a scary vision of a possible future in which birth is regulated by the government.  Unlike Huxley, however, The Handmaid's Tale is also a vision of something far worse--what happens when religion is twisted around and used as a means to force people to do something they don't wish to do, especially if said religion controls the State.  Whether it's Christianity or New Age, or any other religion for that matter, a religion-controlled State can be a very bad thing.The actors in The Handmaid's Tale are a very good bunch.  Natasha Richardson as Kate/Offred turned in a stunning performance, as did Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall as Serena Joy and the Commander.  Aidan Quinn was excellent as Nick, and I loved Elizabeth McGovern's scheming, wily Moira.  Victoria Tennant gave me the chills in her role of Aunt Lydia, and the role of Ofglen, though small, was wonderfully handled by Blanche Baker.All in all, The Handmaid's Tale is a good movie.

I think that the plot was well described by other posters, but I have to say that I find this movie so interesting, thought provoking and moving. I own it and have watched it at least 10 times.As entertainment, it's completely captivating from start to finish. The characters are well developed and you really feel strongly for Natasha Richardson's character. I see where someone else didn't like the acting, but I find it very believable. The story has a sci-fi twist, but it actually seems like something that could really take place. As in every good sci-fi, the culture and look of this world is very well defined so that the movie is believable. It's just simply fascinating on so many levels to watch this story play out.I haven't read the book, and I can understand that the movie doesn't necessarily stay true to it. However it's still a fantastic movie. It's a major cautionary tale about what could happen if people full of hate, racism and religious ideas that twist the bible for their own purposes were to gain control of this country.I highly recommend this movie to sci-fi fans, drama fans and to those who are interested in the message of this movie.Please note that this movie does have scenes where sex acts are taking place that are not consentual.

Some social collapse turns the US in the Nation of Gilead, a brutal theocratic oligarchy. With the social collapse, there was some ecological collapse as well, leaving ""one in a hundred"" (so they say) women able to conceive. Those fertile few are forced into service, to ensure heirs to oligarchs - male ones, of course - with barren marriages.Fay Dunaway plays the scheming wife behind The Commander (Robert Duvall). Natasha Richardson takes the role of Kate, or ""offred"" as she is called in her position as human brood mare. The cover of this DVD gives a hint of what's inside. Richardson has an unusual face, with equal parts strength and fragility in it. It makes her unique - not ""pretty"", but beautiful in a way all her own. The cover picture has airbrushed Richardson's charm into a standard, Barbie-doll look, and lost everything in that face that made it real. That's kind of what they did to Atwood's book, too. They jammed it into the conventional mold with a happy ending (or happy enough). That Procrustean fit required a fair bit of trimming - as with Richardson's face on the cover, they discarded everything about the book that made it so memorable.If you haven't read the book, it's a fair movie.
