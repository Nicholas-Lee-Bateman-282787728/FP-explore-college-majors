Once on her own she again gives birth and never reveals who the birth father is.It's also interesting because the film has a Japanese director, it's filmed in Japan and yet it seems truly to mock Japanese sexism.

1635048,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B00BIYQOXY,Gerard D. Launay,"[2, 3]","100 years later, one can easily forget how difficult it was for a women to forge her own path through the obstacles of every societal norm. Indeed Leonie Gilmore was not only ahead of her time, but even our time.Leonie Gilmore - an educated female at the turn of the century - was not an idealogue, as let's say Emma Goldman. She was not trying to convert anyone to a particular point of view but instead trying to live her life - totally independently of the social values or patriarchal constraints of both the American and the Japanese world.The two leads Emily Mortimer (as Leonie Gilmore) and Shidu Nakamura (as Yone Nagachi) are exceptional in their roles as two loves mismatched in their views.  He is a poet of Japanese birth who is still tied to the customs of his world and believes that women should walk behind the man and even consent to being a mere mistress of someone important.  She is a fiercely intelligent woman who walks behind nobody. However the child actors in the film are very weak characters, and I had to reduce my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars for that deficiency in the movie.  The color cinematography is glorious, with an Asian flair for color and texture.Like the Japanese tea ceremony, this film has many ""moments"" that made me reflect on important societal issues.  Leonie's mother is entirely self-sufficient in California on a farm, rooted to the earth, but fails to appreciate the importance of a father/male influence for her grandson. Leonie gets pregnant from another man, after moving to Japan, but refuses to tell her husband who the father is.  Leonie recognizes the artistic gifts of her son, and urges him to follow that path, even when he thinks that medical school is the better choice.  Leonie returns to the land at the end of her life...becoming unified in spirit and mind, with her own mother.If you can consider this film as poetry, rather like a sequence of Haiku poems, it will interest you.  If you expect fast dialogue or narrative movement, it will disappoint.  I don't expect a large American audience for this quietly interesting picture, but - notwithstanding its flaws - it made me think.

1635053,A29ZNOVQFNLIJD,B00BIYQOXY,"Lyric ""natri""","[0, 0]","It would be impossible to include every twist and turn of the lives of Leonie Gilmour and Yone Noguchi so the makers of this film chose to focus on Leonie and they made the correct choice.  She was a woman very much ahead of her time -- a student at the very young Bryn Mawr College, intelligent, aggressive, not afraid to embrace life regardless of what it brought her way.  Emily Mortimer is a very convincing Leonie -- she captures the spirit of a very definitely spirited woman.  The supporting actors are all fine in their roles too.  The film was obviously made on a tight budget but that constraint doesn't harm the picture -- it contributes to making it the intimate film that it is.  Yone Noguchi -- the father of Leonie's son, the sculptor, artist, set designer, etc. Isamu Noguchi -- was a complex man -- a poet from Japan who gained fame in the US with the help of Leonie who edited his work.  A man who was engaged to one woman, impregnated another, while also having relationships with male acquaintances and who ultimately fathered nine children with the Japanese woman that he married.  Isamu Noguchi like his mother also was a free-spirited who traveled the world in pursuit of his art.  Ultimately this is the story of three very gifted people -- a mother, father and son who lived an unconventional life -- at times together, but mostly apart -- and yet all achieved what can only be called remarkable lives.  The final scenes of the film are quite touching and beautiful in keeping with the spirit of the people involved who pursued art and beauty in their daily lives.I defy anyone to see the film and not come away wanting to know more about all three of these people.",4,Well told story of the life of an independent woman,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,1690,"['would', 'be', 'impossible', 'include', 'twist', 'turn', 'lives', 'Leonie', 'Gilmour', 'Yone', 'Noguchi', 'makers', 'film', 'chose', 'focus', 'Leonie', 'made', 'correct', 'choice', 'was', 'woman', 'very', 'much', 'ahead', 'time', 'student', 'very', 'young', 'Bryn', 'Mawr', 'College', 'intelligent', 'aggressive', 'not', 'afraid', 'embrace', 'life', 'regardless', 'what', 'brought', 'way', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'very', 'convincing', 'Leonie', 'spirit', 'very', 'definitely', 'spirited', 'woman', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'fine', 'roles', 'too', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'tight', 'budget', 'constraint', ""n't"", 'harm', 'picture', 'making', 'intimate', 'film', 'Yone', 'Noguchi', 'father', 'Leonie', 'son', 'sculptor', 'artist', 'set', 'designer', 'etc', 'Isamu', 'Noguchi', 'was', 'complex', 'man', 'poet', 'Japan', 'who', 'gained', 'fame', 'US', 'help', 'Leonie', 'who', 'edited', 'work', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'engaged', 'one', 'woman', 'impregnated', 'also', 'having', 'relationships', 'male', 'acquaintances', 'who', 'ultimately', 'fathered', 'nine', 'children', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'married', 'Isamu', 'Noguchi', 'mother', 'also', 'was', 'free-spirited', 'who', 'traveled', 'world', 'pursuit', 'art', 'Ultimately', 'story', 'three', 'very', 'gifted', 'people', 'mother', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'lived', 'unconventional', 'life', 'times', 'together', 'mostly', 'apart', 'yet', 'achieved', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'remarkable', 'lives', 'final', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'touching', 'beautiful', 'keeping', 'spirit', 'people', 'involved', 'who', 'pursued', 'art', 'beauty', 'daily', 'lives.I', 'defy', 'anyone', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'come', 'away', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'three', 'people']",Leonie
1635054,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B00BIYQOXY,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[14, 17]","3 1/2 starsDirector Hisako Matsui films this movie mostly in English, but in a very Japanese style that many Westerners will find difficult to interpret or enjoy. (explained below)This movie uses the life of Leonie Gilmour and her son Isamu Noguchi, the famous sculptor, as a backdrop to convey social issues including women's rights during the early 1900's.  It is poetic in both dialog and cinematography at moments.  However, it may be a little dry for many viewers.THE PLOT: Leonie is a bright, educated, American woman who agrees to become editor, and ultimately lover, to the Japanese poet Yone Noguchi.  She bears his child (Isamu) out of wedlock and follows him to Japan.  One can imagine the resulting complications for a smart woman of pre-suffrage United States.  The recounting of Leonie's time in Japan serves to amplify those professional, social and romantic conflicts as she deals with the cultural shock of life for women in Japan (an even more patriarchal society).  Leonie comes to the realization that she will only be his mistress as Yone already has a wife.  He tells her ""this is the culture of Japan and there is nothing you can do about it"".  To her credit, Leonie takes her son and forges her own path while encouraging his strengths, spending years more in Japan.  This movie expounds on that line of finding one's true self as Isamu grows to college age.  He secures a benefactor and applies himself to becoming a doctor in America to show gratitude (despite the fact he is clearly an artist by nature).  When Leonie finds out Isamu's course of study as a doctor, she attempts to set him straight.The backdrop of post industrialized Japan is also very interesting.  The references are fleeting, but the movie opens near the start of the Russo-Japanese War.  Japan had recently emerged from essentially a feudal period, after observing the changing nature of warfare during the American Civil War.  In just a few decades, Japan emerged and then defeated the largest military power of their time (Russia), much to the world's surprise.  The movie shows early on how Anti-Japanese sentiment in the US had already intensified before WWI.For those not familiar with Japanese literature and film, there is not that western focus of climax and D&eacute;nouement that we are used to.  I admit, Japanese lit classes were my least favorite.  Their stories tend to amble along and then simply end.  The journey or process is more important than the destination.  As Leonie's Tea Ceremony instructor more aptly puts it ""...the expression is MOST important.  The tension of drama lies in the delicate grace of a perfect moment, the fragility of something beautiful."" This style is fine when illustrating a life story since that is kind of like life.  We muddle through it, and then someday it just ends.  This movie is not so much an entertainment piece as it is an illustration, an expression.  Western viewers will find the character development lacking as the story skips from event to event.  Remember, this isn't as much a biography as they would have one believe.Special mention should go to Emily Mortimer who proves she is far more than just a favorite actress from the UK.  Her performance here is truly outstanding. I dropped my rating to 3 1/2 stars only because I felt some of the issues they tried to express were not that effective and the movie will be tedious to many viewers.  However, the production values are excelent and the movie is beautiful in many places.",4,"DON'T BORE HER BY BEING ORDINARY!
