Excellent for winding down with. Great for intermediates, although pace yourself as there are no modifications. It is a thorough work out that completely stretches you out and calms the mind. I like to do it in the afternoons or weekend when I have time for a longer routine. It is a little new-agey in style, references to the heart etc., but not overly so. If you like power yoga, in the style of Shiva Rea, Rodney Yee, Bryan Kest etc you will probably enjoy this one too.",5,Power and grace,1235001600,"02 19, 2009",2009,607,"['excellent', 'hour-long', 'routine', 'great', 'flow', 'yet', 'gentleness', 'too', 'Nice', 'combinations', 'movements', 'not', 'boring', 'Excellent', 'winding', 'down', 'Great', 'intermediates', 'pace', 'are', 'modifications', 'thorough', 'work', 'out', 'completely', 'stretches', 'calms', 'mind', 'like', 'do', 'afternoons', 'weekend', 'when', 'have', 'time', 'longer', 'routine', 'little', 'new-agey', 'style', 'references', 'heart', 'etc.', 'not', 'overly', 'so', 'like', 'power', 'yoga', 'style', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'etc', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one', 'too']","Yogatopia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow ~ Power"

There are some poses that I have never seen anywhere else such as doing crunches while your legs and arms are in eagle pose.  Although I don't have the shoulder flexibility to cross my arms in eagle pose it is definitely something I am working towards.  This video is just the way I like it, not a whole lot of distractions in the background for fluff.  I only have two small criticisms as far as this video is concerned.  One is the filming.  There are a few times when Ms. Kapantais is doing a folding pose, and although she tells you what you should be doing, there is no way to tell because the camera isn't showing how to do it, and there are times when the camera zooms in and then zooms out for no apparent reason although that is done very rarely.  Two-I could have done without the candles around the elevated mat.  I'm guessing that Ms. Kapantais was trying to set the mood, but there was really no need for it.  If you can live with these two small distractions then I strongly suggest this video to anybody who wants to improve their strength and flexibility.",5,My personal favorite,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1170,"['dvd', 'personal', 'favorite', 'enjoy', 'dvd', 'end', 'dvd', 'will', 'work', 'end', 'are', 'poses', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'else', 'such', 'doing', 'crunches', 'legs', 'arms', 'are', 'eagle', 'pose', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'shoulder', 'flexibility', 'cross', 'arms', 'eagle', 'pose', 'definitely', 'something', 'am', 'working', 'towards', 'video', 'just', 'way', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'distractions', 'background', 'fluff', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'small', 'criticisms', 'as', 'far', 'video', 'concerned', 'One', 'filming', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'Ms.', 'Kapantais', 'doing', 'folding', 'pose', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'way', 'tell', 'camera', ""n't"", 'showing', 'how', 'do', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'camera', 'zooms', 'then', 'out', 'apparent', 'reason', 'done', 'very', 'rarely', 'Two-I', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'candles', 'elevated', 'mat', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Ms.', 'Kapantais', 'was', 'trying', 'set', 'mood', 'there', 'was', 'really', 'need', 'can', 'live', 'two', 'small', 'distractions', 'then', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'video', 'anybody', 'who', 'improve', 'strength', 'flexibility']","Yogatopia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow ~ Power"
918772,A3HLVDN00UGDQ0,B000A26M1E,Compassionate Warrior,"[3, 3]","This is an awesome practice! It is an intermediate, original, vigorous, creative and yet calming power yoga flow. I love it! Her choreography has unique flows which you don't come across much that make for a refreshing practice. Also, I always love when theres a good variety of asanas with chatarungas interspersed to give a good upper body workout to get the blood pumping. She does not dissapoint, this will definitely challenge your legs and upper body. However, she lightens it up a bit by not putting a vinyasa (chatarunga, updog, downdog) between sides, just before and after--but if I want to put it up a notch I just add it in. Also, most of her vinyasa's actually go to cobra but I just modify it to updog and add an extra pushup in there instead which is very easy to do (nothing is carved in stone). She includes alot of asana variety for both strength and stretch making it fun and interesting. This is a very dynamic well rounded practice! She does an excellent job of the voice over cueing, her voice is soothing and calming with excellent, intuitive direction that's just enough to keep you focused without slowing the wonderful flow. Amazing! She almost reminded me of Shiva that way--Shiva's got one of the best voice over cueing around! The only drawback I see with her cueing is that sometimes it lags behind the movement which is too bad because everything else about this practice is just so exceptional, I just wish they could have corrected this. Still it does not demerit a star from my rating.The production and setting is very professionally done. It's in a studio on a stylized platform with votive type candles around the platform giving a soothing, calm touch (somehow doesn't come across as cheap or kichy). The camera work is excellent. The video has a very calming, soothing, dynamic feel to it.This is an amazing practice and highly recommended to all you Shiva, Bryan, Baron, Eoin, Mark, power, vinyasa yoga lovers out there!!",5,Totally Amazing Vigorous and Creative Flow,1193356800,"10 26, 2007",2007,1961,"['awesome', 'practice', 'intermediate', 'original', 'vigorous', 'creative', 'yet', 'calming', 'power', 'yoga', 'flow', 'love', 'choreography', 'unique', 'flows', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'across', 'much', 'make', 'refreshing', 'practice', 'Also', 'always', 'love', 'when', 'good', 'variety', 'asanas', 'chatarungas', 'interspersed', 'give', 'good', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'get', 'blood', 'pumping', 'not', 'dissapoint', 'will', 'definitely', 'challenge', 'legs', 'upper', 'body', 'However', 'up', 'bit', 'not', 'putting', 'vinyasa', 'chatarunga', 'updog', 'downdog', 'sides', 'just', 'want', 'put', 'up', 'notch', 'just', 'add', 'Also', 'most', 'vinyasa', 'actually', 'go', 'cobra', 'just', 'modify', 'updog', 'add', 'extra', 'pushup', 'instead', 'very', 'easy', 'do', 'nothing', 'carved', 'stone', 'alot', 'asana', 'variety', 'strength', 'stretch', 'making', 'fun', 'interesting', 'very', 'dynamic', 'well', 'rounded', 'practice', 'excellent', 'job', 'voice', 'cueing', 'voice', 'soothing', 'calming', 'excellent', 'intuitive', 'direction', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'focused', 'slowing', 'wonderful', 'flow', 'Amazing', 'almost', 'reminded', 'Shiva', 'way', 'Shiva', 'got', 'one', 'best', 'voice', 'cueing', 'around', 'only', 'drawback', 'see', 'cueing', 'movement', 'too', 'bad', 'everything', 'else', 'practice', 'just', 'so', 'exceptional', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'corrected', 'Still', 'not', 'demerit', 'star', 'rating.The', 'production', 'setting', 'very', 'professionally', 'done', 'studio', 'stylized', 'platform', 'votive', 'type', 'candles', 'platform', 'giving', 'soothing', 'calm', 'touch', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'come', 'cheap', 'kichy', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'video', 'very', 'calming', 'soothing', 'dynamic', 'feel', 'it.This', 'amazing', 'practice', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Shiva', 'Bryan', 'Baron', 'Eoin', 'Mark', 'power', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'lovers', 'out', 'there']","Yogatopia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow ~ Power"
918773,AXZ085P4SPXVL,B000A26M1E,"Just Breathe ""Just Breathe""","[1, 1]","I love the asanas chosen in this dvd as well as the sequencing of the asanas.  Many other reviewers are correct that the cueing is not  synced well with what is on the screen.  I purchased this yoga a couple of years ago when I was newer to yoga and it didn't work well for me due to the cueing issue.  I recently pulled it back out and have found that it is not a problem at all for me.  I rarely look at the screen and just follow the verbal cues.I highly recommend that you start the practice with the menu pick titled ""Breath"".  It only runs approximately 4 minutes and includes breath of fire and ujjayi breathing.  It is nice to start with this so that you don't forget to use the ujjayi breathing throughout the practice.  I even run through the breath portion twice sometimes before moving on to the asana practice portion of the DVD.The asana practice is 1 hour in length which includes shavasana for approximately 5 minutes.  Lisa's voice is very nice.  When going through vinyasas she usually instructs you to do chataranga dandasana all the way to the floor and then into cobra, however you can do chataranga to upward facing dog if you prefer.  Depending upon how I am feeling some days I may hit the pause button to hold some of the poses longer, but usually not.  There is such a good variety of poses in this one hour practice.  I will be using this once or twice per week in addition to my own personal practice.** EDITED -- I am coming back to add some comments.  I had not done this DVD for some time and pulled it out the other day.  I do not think that I will use this DVD again as it moves through the poses quicker than I like.  I enjoy a flowing vinyasa practice, but I like to move with my breath, which is much slower than the pace of this DVD.",5,Great flow and variety of asanas,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,1770,"['love', 'asanas', 'chosen', 'dvd', 'as', 'well', 'sequencing', 'asanas', 'Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'correct', 'cueing', 'not', 'synced', 'well', 'what', 'screen', 'purchased', 'yoga', 'couple', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'newer', 'yoga', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'due', 'cueing', 'issue', 'recently', 'pulled', 'back', 'have', 'found', 'not', 'problem', 'rarely', 'look', 'screen', 'just', 'follow', 'verbal', 'cues.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'start', 'practice', 'menu', 'pick', 'titled', 'Breath', 'only', 'approximately', '4', 'minutes', 'breath', 'fire', 'ujjayi', 'breathing', 'nice', 'start', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'use', 'ujjayi', 'breathing', 'practice', 'even', 'run', 'breath', 'portion', 'twice', 'sometimes', 'moving', 'asana', 'practice', 'portion', 'DVD.The', 'asana', 'practice', '1', 'hour', 'length', 'shavasana', 'approximately', '5', 'minutes', 'Lisa', 'voice', 'very', 'nice', 'When', 'going', 'vinyasas', 'usually', 'do', 'chataranga', 'dandasana', 'way', 'floor', 'then', 'cobra', 'however', 'can', 'do', 'chataranga', 'upward', 'facing', 'dog', 'prefer', 'Depending', 'how', 'am', 'feeling', 'days', 'may', 'hit', 'pause', 'button', 'hold', 'poses', 'longer', 'usually', 'not', 'such', 'good', 'variety', 'poses', 'one', 'hour', 'practice', 'will', 'be', 'using', 'once', 'twice', 'week', 'addition', 'own', 'personal', 'practice', '**', 'EDITED', 'am', 'coming', 'back', 'add', 'comments', 'had', 'not', 'done', 'DVD', 'time', 'pulled', 'out', 'other', 'day', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'will', 'use', 'DVD', 'again', 'poses', 'quicker', 'like', 'enjoy', 'flowing', 'vinyasa', 'practice', 'like', 'move', 'breath', 'much', 'slower', 'pace', 'DVD']","Yogatopia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow ~ Power"

I felt like I had just fallen in love for the first hour after I had finished it.You go through a very very wide variety of poses, which I am not going to begin to list. The best part is that you flow through them all, without explanatory breaks.  This can also make it kind of confusing, because some of the poses were unfamiliar.  But after doing the practice a few times, I am sure it will be much easier.There is a breathing section in the beginning.  (This is not part of the 60 minute workout.) There is also a warm up.  The teacher is wonderful - soft spoken and soothing.This is an intermediate workout.  I wouldn't say that this is the most challenging workout in terms of strength, but you need strength to do it.  This practice definitely challenges balance, endurance, and flexibility.  It made me nice and sweaty.  More importantly, it just made me feel ridiculously good, and I would recommend it to you whole-heartedly.Edit: I did this workout another time watching form carefully, and it became even more challenging.  I rescind what I said about not challenging strength that much - it challenges your legs and requires core strength to do it all gracefully. (Arm strength challenged through sun salutes mainly, and there aren't too many). Also, it is challenging aerobically, but not too fast (it is challenging because it doesn't really have resting poses - it is all active poses). And I still felt absolutely wonderful at the end - it is just a beautiful, graceful practice.Also, here are some of the poses:  warrior series, triangle series, sun salutation A (and B?), crow, dancer, pigeon (single and double leg), half moon... more and more",5,Awesome!!,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,1778,"['am', 'so', 'happy', 'bought', 'video', 'beautiful', 'practice', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'smiling', 'finished', 'felt', 'had', 'just', 'fallen', 'love', 'first', 'hour', 'had', 'finished', 'it.You', 'go', 'very', 'very', 'wide', 'variety', 'poses', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'begin', 'list', 'best', 'part', 'flow', 'explanatory', 'breaks', 'can', 'also', 'make', 'kind', 'confusing', 'poses', 'were', 'unfamiliar', 'doing', 'practice', 'few', 'times', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'breathing', 'section', 'beginning', 'not', 'part', '60', 'minute', 'workout', 'also', 'warm', 'up', 'teacher', 'wonderful', 'soft', 'spoken', 'soothing.This', 'intermediate', 'workout', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'most', 'challenging', 'workout', 'terms', 'strength', 'need', 'strength', 'do', 'practice', 'definitely', 'balance', 'endurance', 'flexibility', 'made', 'nice', 'sweaty', 'More', 'importantly', 'just', 'made', 'feel', 'ridiculously', 'good', 'would', 'recommend', 'whole-heartedly.Edit', 'did', 'workout', 'time', 'watching', 'form', 'carefully', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'challenging', 'rescind', 'what', 'said', 'not', 'challenging', 'strength', 'much', 'legs', 'core', 'strength', 'do', 'gracefully', 'Arm', 'strength', 'challenged', 'sun', 'salutes', 'mainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'Also', 'challenging', 'aerobically', 'not', 'too', 'fast', 'challenging', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'resting', 'poses', 'active', 'poses', 'still', 'felt', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'end', 'just', 'beautiful', 'graceful', 'practice.Also', 'here', 'are', 'poses', 'warrior', 'series', 'triangle', 'series', 'sun', 'salutation', 'A', 'B', 'crow', 'dancer', 'pigeon', 'single', 'double', 'leg', 'half', 'moon', 'more', 'more']","Yogatopia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow ~ Power"

In the Music Flow which is the same thing w/music only, it's wonderful to hear the full rich sounds (but I still need voice direction).I agree Litsa is very calming both in movement & in voice & the spiritual reminders were lovely. The flow is great as well as the large amount of different poses, though a little repetitive with warrior I series in the sun salutations. She does better with the warrior 2/side angle flow & beyond. I enjoy the backwards/reverse warriors, the bound poses, etc. that aren't on most yoga dvds.This is definitely a fast-paced session. You go in/out within 1-2 breaths, which for me is enough to go into it & she's already going out since I take my time. I've done Rodney Yee's power yoga which I loved & Kabalah yoga which was holds it for 4-6 breaths is my perfect pace, the one minute holds bore me.I did have trouble following her cuing since she goes so fast, she can only give basic body placement reminders & the English pose name. Since the voice over is WAY after what she is doing on screen, it's almost of no help to even turn your head to look. Many times I had to stop & rewind to see exactly how to bound my arms correctly which ruined the flow for me & not hearing the music also disappointed me & I didn't finish the dvd because of it.This would be 5 stars if the cuing/timing & sound/music levels were fixed.Litsa Kapantais's website here: yoga-topia netReview w/almost perfect content of this dvd:  videofitness com/reviews/kapantais-y-vf-pwc php  (add dot where there is a space)",4,Power paced Vinyasa 60 min for intermediates or advanced,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,1799,"['Everyone', 'wrote', 'great', 'reviews', 'add', 'what', 'agree', 'disagree', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'except', 'Main', 'Flow', 'voice', 'music', 'voice', 'over', 'so', 'loud', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'great', 'music', 'want', 'disturb', 'neighbors', 'Music', 'Flow', 'same', 'thing', 'w/music', 'only', 'wonderful', 'hear', 'full', 'rich', 'sounds', 'still', 'need', 'voice', 'direction', '.I', 'agree', 'Litsa', 'very', 'calming', 'movement', 'voice', 'spiritual', 'reminders', 'were', 'lovely', 'flow', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'large', 'amount', 'different', 'poses', 'little', 'repetitive', 'warrior', 'series', 'sun', 'salutations', 'better', 'warrior', '2/side', 'angle', 'flow', 'enjoy', 'backwards/reverse', 'warriors', 'bound', 'etc', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'yoga', 'dvds.This', 'definitely', 'fast-paced', 'session', 'go', 'in/out', '1-2', 'breaths', 'enough', 'go', 'already', 'going', 'take', 'time', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'power', 'yoga', 'loved', 'Kabalah', 'yoga', 'was', '4-6', 'breaths', 'perfect', 'pace', 'one', 'minute', 'bore', 'me.I', 'did', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'cuing', 'so', 'fast', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'basic', 'body', 'placement', 'reminders', 'English', 'pose', 'name', 'voice', 'WAY', 'what', 'doing', 'screen', 'almost', 'help', 'even', 'turn', 'head', 'look', 'Many', 'times', 'had', 'stop', 'rewind', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'bound', 'arms', 'correctly', 'ruined', 'flow', 'not', 'hearing', 'music', 'also', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'dvd', 'it.This', 'would', 'be', '5', 'stars', 'cuing/timing', 'sound/music', 'levels', 'were', 'fixed.Litsa', 'Kapantais', 'website', 'here', 'yoga-topia', 'netReview', 'w/almost', 'perfect', 'content', 'dvd', 'videofitness', 'com/reviews/kapantais-y-vf-pwc', 'php', 'add', 'dot', 'where', 'space']","Yogatopia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow ~ Power"

They're all accessible, none is too advanced, and designed to touch every inch of you - inside and out.  (For guidance, examples of the most challenging are Dancer, Double Pigeon, both Bows and Warrior III.)LK guides with a beautiful, peaceful and gently encouraging voice.  Her description of the poses is clear and she smoothly takes you through transitions.  The additional notes she gives regarding minor adjustments you can make while in the pose to lengthen, strengthen and align can be very helpful.However, the decision to have the verbal cuing slightly behind the movement on screen feels wrong.  It's just too far behind and therefore a little disconcerting - as if you're trying to catch up.  If you do like to glance at the screen throughout practice, you'll sometimes feel that you are in two places at once rather than focused and in the present.Visually simple, with a plain off-white background and LK alone on a raised circular platform and mat surrounded by tea-candles.  The music is a rhythmic coalition of sounds, usually gentle, occasionally a little surging, of bells and drums.  Sound clarity is superb.This is a serene, beautiful and fairly full spectrum beginner/intermediate lesson.  It incorporates a wide variety of breathing, stretching, strengthening and balancing poses, made different by the unusual transitions and occasional use of breath of fire.",4,"A wonderfully soothing and challenging, well-rounded practice; but I'll have to work on accepting the delayed cuing",1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,1447,"['asanas', 'variety', 'challenge', 'levels', 'intermediate', ""'re"", 'accessible', 'none', 'too', 'advanced', 'designed', 'touch', 'inch', 'inside', 'out', 'guidance', 'examples', 'most', 'challenging', 'are', 'Dancer', 'Double', 'Pigeon', 'Bows', 'Warrior', 'III', 'LK', 'beautiful', 'peaceful', 'gently', 'encouraging', 'voice', 'description', 'poses', 'clear', 'smoothly', 'transitions', 'additional', 'notes', 'regarding', 'minor', 'adjustments', 'can', 'make', 'pose', 'lengthen', 'strengthen', 'align', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'helpful.However', 'decision', 'have', 'verbal', 'cuing', 'slightly', 'movement', 'screen', 'feels', 'wrong', 'just', 'too', 'far', 'therefore', 'little', 'disconcerting', ""'re"", 'trying', 'catch', 'up', 'do', 'glance', 'screen', 'practice', ""'ll"", 'sometimes', 'feel', 'are', 'two', 'places', 'once', 'rather', 'focused', 'present.Visually', 'simple', 'plain', 'off-white', 'background', 'LK', 'alone', 'raised', 'circular', 'platform', 'mat', 'surrounded', 'tea-candles', 'music', 'rhythmic', 'coalition', 'sounds', 'usually', 'gentle', 'occasionally', 'little', 'surging', 'bells', 'drums', 'Sound', 'clarity', 'superb.This', 'serene', 'beautiful', 'fairly', 'full', 'spectrum', 'beginner/intermediate', 'lesson', 'wide', 'variety', 'breathing', 'stretching', 'strengthening', 'balancing', 'poses', 'made', 'different', 'unusual', 'transitions', 'occasional', 'use', 'breath', 'fire']","Yogatopia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow ~ Power"

It's very difficult for me to find a DVD I want a unique, inspiring, and challenging practice.  Yogatopia delivers!  It starts off with a nice warm-up using cat-cow breathing and low lunges.  Then it evolves into a unique Salutation B (unique because rather than going from DD to WI to vinyasa it does three warrior variations).  After these salutations I'm already feeling very fluid and energized.  Then you go through a couple of standing series with reverse warrior, extended angle, and triangle.  The poses themselves overall are not very unique, but I love the sequencing and flow.  A few poses you will see (aside from the ones mentioned above and in no particular order) are dancer, crow, eagle, bridge, camel, side plank, reverse plank (which I love and rarely see in yoga DVDs), reverse triangle, and pyramid.Something that is unique is that she incorporates fire breathing in a few of the poses.  Also this video has one of the most soothing shavasanas I've found.  She doesn't talk the whole way through it, and the music is perfect.  Also, unlike most DVDs, she doesn't just leave you lying there but gently pulls you back.One drawback is that, like other reviewers have said, the voiceovers are WAY off.  The first few times I followed the DVD it was very frustrating, but once I got used to the practice it didn't bother me at all because I wasn't looking at the screen anyway.",4,Lovely practice,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,1492,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Yogatopia', ""'ve"", 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', '6', 'years', 'have', 'taught', 'classes', 'very', 'difficult', 'find', 'DVD', 'want', 'unique', 'inspiring', 'challenging', 'practice', 'delivers', 'nice', 'warm-up', 'using', 'cat-cow', 'breathing', 'low', 'lunges', 'Then', 'unique', 'Salutation', 'B', 'unique', 'rather', 'going', 'DD', 'WI', 'vinyasa', 'three', 'warrior', 'variations', 'salutations', ""'m"", 'already', 'feeling', 'very', 'fluid', 'energized', 'Then', 'go', 'couple', 'standing', 'series', 'reverse', 'warrior', 'extended', 'angle', 'triangle', 'poses', 'overall', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'unique', 'love', 'sequencing', 'flow', 'few', 'poses', 'will', 'see', 'aside', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'particular', 'order', 'are', 'dancer', 'crow', 'eagle', 'bridge', 'camel', 'side', 'plank', 'reverse', 'plank', 'love', 'rarely', 'see', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'reverse', 'triangle', 'pyramid.Something', 'unique', 'fire', 'breathing', 'few', 'poses', 'Also', 'video', 'one', 'most', 'soothing', 'shavasanas', ""'ve"", 'found', ""n't"", 'talk', 'whole', 'way', 'music', 'perfect', 'Also', 'most', 'DVDs', ""n't"", 'just', 'leave', 'lying', 'there', 'gently', 'back.One', 'drawback', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'WAY', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'followed', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'frustrating', 'once', 'got', 'used', 'practice', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'screen', 'anyway']","Yogatopia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow ~ Power"

It is a challenging vinyasa yoga practice that flows really well from one pose to another but this is not the same old boring power yoga routine , it is actually unique with poses I have not seen on other yoga tapes, like doing crunches in a supine eagle pose plus a lot of great transitions from one pose to another, even the sun salutations are a little bit different. This is definitely not for beginners , it's quite fast and there are poses like crow , side plank, shoulder stand and plow and there are no modifications, but there is no super advanced stuff. There is also a bonus pranayama section and an option to do the workout with no instruction.If you like Shiva Rea's type of yoga you will probably like this one too. Highly recommended and worth the price.",5,Original & Creative Vinyasa Flow Yoga,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,812,"['DVD', 'one', 'favorite', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'challenging', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'practice', 'really', 'well', 'one', 'pose', 'not', 'same', 'old', 'boring', 'power', 'yoga', 'routine', 'actually', 'unique', 'poses', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'doing', 'crunches', 'supine', 'eagle', 'pose', 'lot', 'great', 'transitions', 'one', 'pose', 'even', 'sun', 'salutations', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'definitely', 'not', 'beginners', 'quite', 'fast', 'are', 'poses', 'crow', 'side', 'plank', 'shoulder', 'stand', 'plow', 'are', 'modifications', 'super', 'advanced', 'stuff', 'also', 'bonus', 'pranayama', 'section', 'option', 'do', 'workout', 'instruction.If', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'type', 'yoga', 'will', 'probably', 'one', 'too', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'price']","Yogatopia, The Art of Vinyasa Flow ~ Power"
