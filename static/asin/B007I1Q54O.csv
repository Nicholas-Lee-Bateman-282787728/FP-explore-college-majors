1531176,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B007I1Q54O,Boston Reader,"[0, 0]","Season six didn't really feel like the show anymore. But season 7 felt different in a good way. Here we have everyone returning from season 6, except Jullianne Nicholson who was pregnant. Alicia Witt take her place for a short while in the same sense that Micheal Imporeli takes over for Jesse L. Martin in season 15 of Law & Order. Her character is described as a ""hot-head,"" thus giving Chris Noth's Logan a chance to be the diplomat or the voice of reason. In the season opener, we see the Goren, Eames and Ross respond to the shooting of a police officer. Detective Eames' deceased husband's old partner. It gets personal as Goren outs a cop's disability and re-open's Eames' husband's murder. Most if not all the episodes were top-notch. Warren Leight has made the necessary improvements in season 7 that were needed in season 6. The one change I am not so found of was the Law & Order: Trial By Jury style opening credits and theme music that was for the USA Network airings of new Criminal Intent episodes. It's funny how season 6 was less dark with a serious opening and season 7 was more darker with a fast-paced or even upbeat opening. There are also some noticeable flaws on the Shout Factory DVD box. Dick Wolf's last name is spelled ""Wolfe"" despite his name showing up at least three times throughout an episode and it is mislabeled as the '08-'09 season when in fact it was the '07-'08 season. Hopefully the Shout Factory will pay more attention to future projects and avoid repeats of such mistakes. I strongly recommend that you buy this season despite the minor issues. It's definitely well-written overall and the very compact without having to resort to the annoying double-sided disk. Also this marks Chris Noth's last season as Detective Micheal Logan.

1531178,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B007I1Q54O,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[11, 11]","I first started watching Law & Order Criminal Intent in the spring of 2007 when USA use to have nightly mini-marathons of CI and SVU. The series first aired on NBC on September 30, 2001 until May 21, 2007, when it moved to its sister network USA in the fall of 2007 until it finally ended its run on June 26, 2011. NBCUniversal have been extremely slow about releasing Law & Order: CI's ten year run to DVD. Luckily for us fans, Shout! Factory bought the DVD rights, releasing season 7 exactly one year to the date that the series ended.Just like the previous few seasons, every other episode is split between the detective combo of Goren/Eames and Logan/Wheeler. Actually, Megan Wheeler (played by Julianne Nicholson, who was on maternity leave) is missing for half the season as the character went to Europe to teach a course on American Police Procedure. During this time, Mike Logan (played by Chris Noth) teams up with Detective Nola Falaccia (played by Alicia Witt).The season starts out with Amends, in which Eames' (played by Kathryn Erbe) late husband's partner is murdered, and Goren must help her find the killer. My favorite episode is Untethered, where Goren (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) goes undercover in a psychiatric ward to help his nephew and must confront his own demons. The season ends with Frame, where Goren's brother is murdered, and the prime suspect could be Goren's nemesis, Nicole Wallace.The episodes on the five discs are:Disc One: Amends; Seeds; Smile; and Lonelyville.Disc Two: Depths; Courtship; Self-Made; and Offense.Disc Three: Untethered; Senseless: Purgatory; and Contract.Disc Four: Betrayed; Assassin; Please Note We Are No Longer Accepting Letters of Recommendation From Henry Kissinger; Reunion; and Vanishing Act.Disc Five: Ten Count; Legacy; Neighborhood Watch; Last Rites; and Frame.Unlike the box sets of seasons, 4-6, season seven has no box; there is just a slipcover over a typical DVD case. The DVD cover is in the same design style of the previous few seasons as is the discs' design. Season seven aired from October 7, 2007 to June 24, 2008 and not during the '08-'09 Season as stated on the cover and on each discs. Just like the previous seasons, there are no extras in this set.Despite the '08-09' error and the lack of extras, I am glad that season 7 is finally on DVD to own.",4,Criminal Intent's First USA Season,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,2334,"['first', 'started', 'watching', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'spring', '2007', 'when', 'USA', 'use', 'have', 'nightly', 'mini-marathons', 'CI', 'SVU', 'series', 'first', 'aired', 'NBC', 'September', '30', '2001', 'May', '21', '2007', 'when', 'moved', 'sister', 'network', 'USA', 'fall', '2007', 'finally', 'ended', 'run', 'June', '26', '2011', 'NBCUniversal', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'slow', 'releasing', 'Law', 'Order', 'CI', 'ten', 'year', 'run', 'DVD', 'Luckily', 'fans', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'bought', 'DVD', 'rights', 'releasing', 'season', '7', 'exactly', 'one', 'year', 'date', 'series', 'ended.Just', 'previous', 'few', 'seasons', 'other', 'episode', 'split', 'detective', 'combo', 'Goren/Eames', 'Logan/Wheeler', 'Actually', 'Megan', 'Wheeler', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'was', 'maternity', 'leave', 'missing', 'season', 'character', 'went', 'Europe', 'teach', 'course', 'American', 'Police', 'Procedure', 'time', 'Mike', 'Logan', 'played', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'up', 'Detective', 'Nola', 'Falaccia', 'played', 'Alicia', 'Witt', '.The', 'season', 'out', 'Amends', 'Eames', 'played', 'Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'late', 'husband', 'partner', 'murdered', 'Goren', 'must', 'help', 'find', 'killer', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Untethered', 'where', 'Goren', 'played', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'undercover', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'help', 'nephew', 'must', 'confront', 'own', 'demons', 'season', 'Frame', 'where', 'Goren', 'brother', 'murdered', 'prime', 'suspect', 'could', 'be', 'Goren', 'nemesis', 'Nicole', 'Wallace.The', 'episodes', 'five', 'discs', 'are', 'Disc', 'One', 'Amends', 'Seeds', 'Smile', 'Lonelyville.Disc', 'Two', 'Depths', 'Courtship', 'Self-Made', 'Offense.Disc', 'Three', 'Untethered', 'Senseless', 'Purgatory', 'Contract.Disc', 'Four', 'Betrayed', 'Assassin', 'Please', 'Note', 'Are', 'No', 'Longer', 'Accepting', 'Letters', 'Recommendation', 'From', 'Henry', 'Kissinger', 'Reunion', 'Vanishing', 'Act.Disc', 'Five', 'Ten', 'Count', 'Legacy', 'Neighborhood', 'Watch', 'Last', 'Rites', 'box', 'sets', 'seasons', '4-6', 'season', 'seven', 'box', 'just', 'slipcover', 'typical', 'DVD', 'case', 'DVD', 'cover', 'same', 'design', 'style', 'previous', 'few', 'seasons', 'discs', 'design', 'Season', 'seven', 'aired', 'October', '7', '2007', 'June', '24', '2008', 'not', ""'08-'09"", 'Season', 'stated', 'cover', 'discs', 'Just', 'previous', 'seasons', 'are', 'extras', 'set.Despite', ""'08-09"", 'error', 'lack', 'extras', 'am', 'glad', 'season', '7', 'finally', 'DVD', 'own']",Law & Order: Criminal Intent: Year Seven

Her performance in this episode outshone everyone, including her partner whose gentleness and sensitivity was well played by D'onofrio. I wish that Eames got more roles like this to play, because she did it very well. I am impressed with the tortured, mourning uneasy self that Goren depicts, knowing that he is walking on uncertain ground in this season.Captain Ross continues to play a fine role in this series with his wry, deadpan comments and his ability to control his team despite his height. I like him the best of all the captains for this series and believe me, that world weary turn of phrase that he is good for makes the episodes all the better.I was never really too impressed with Mike Logan's character and his plethora of partners, but here he gets some really cracking cases to work with and the character takes off, so to speak. I don't care for the Falacci character myself and yes, she is damn irritating. Thank god she gets replaced.All I can say is that you will not be disappointed with this season.
