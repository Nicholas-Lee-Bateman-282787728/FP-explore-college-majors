The original night this aired, January-something, '87, a beloved ""ex"" of mine & I had decided we were taking one another for granted, so we decided to kind of ""recreate some of the original thrills of our (ahem) ""courtship."" ALL THE WAY, let me tell you: we got ourselves a motel room, acquired all the necessary...""accoutrements,"" and set out to ""sheer a couple of years off our relationship.""  Unfortunately...well, maybe ""fortunately,"" (I subsequently eschewed playing in ""rock"" bands and ""went country"") ""beloved ex"" requested I bring along my battered Epiphone acoustic guitar, and (ahem again) ""sing love songs to her.""  NO problem - but a combination of the ""accoutrements,"" and the fact that Johnny Cash - Johnny Cash, now - was on ""Austin City Limits"" that glorious evening...Beloved Ex actually told me, ""I didn't realize you were telling me the truth when you said you knew how to 'sing country' - you SCARED me when Johnny Cash performed 'Long Black Veil!' You sounded like you were 'channeling' him!""  That may or may not have been an undeserved compliment, but truth is, maybe it scared me too: I didn't realize that I ""knew"" all those songs.  OK. so all that's ""rambling"" - sue me.  ""Austin City Limits"" is, without doubt, the absolute premier  ""showcase for displaying talent.""  We've even, subsequently, seen Rob't Plant and REM, two ""musical entities"" that we could have gone the rest of our lives without knowing about, and even THEY sounded good!  (sort of)  But here, Johnny Cash uses a seven-piece backup band (TWO trumpets for an organic non-synthesizer ""Ring Of Fire""), and he has two not-completely-unexpected vocalists, June Carter Cash and Anita Carter.  Folks, ""Austin City Limits,"" again, is the finest musical ""milieu"" for just about ANY existent performer (read what I've written about Tony Joe White!)  But when a genius - a GENTLEMAN, the nature of Johnny Cash performs - the result is incredible.  This performance of Mr. Cash, along with the DVD, compiling the ""best ofs"" from his own show - well, unless, you possess a tape (whatever) of Mr. Cash @ Folsom Prison, or better still, even before THAT - this, simply, is a necessity.",5,American Music at its very Finest,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,2432,"['would', ""n't"", 'time', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'recount', 'single', 'incident', 'show', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 're-releasing', 'best', 'specifically', 'Tony', 'Joe', 'White', 'Texas', 'Tornadoes', 'BEST', 'DVD', '5:1', 'DTS', 'et', 'cetera', 'DVD', 'original', 'night', 'aired', 'January-something', ""'87"", 'beloved', 'ex', 'mine', 'had', 'decided', 'were', 'taking', 'one', 'granted', 'decided', 'kind', 'recreate', 'original', 'thrills', 'ahem', 'courtship', 'WAY', 'let', 'tell', 'got', 'motel', 'room', 'acquired', 'necessary', 'accoutrements', 'set', 'out', 'sheer', 'couple', 'years', 'relationship', 'Unfortunately', 'well', 'maybe', 'fortunately', 'subsequently', 'eschewed', 'playing', 'rock', 'bands', 'went', 'country', 'beloved', 'ex', 'requested', 'bring', 'along', 'battered', 'Epiphone', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'ahem', 'again', 'sing', 'love', 'songs', 'problem', 'combination', 'accoutrements', 'fact', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'now', 'was', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'glorious', 'evening', 'Beloved', 'Ex', 'actually', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'were', 'telling', 'truth', 'when', 'said', 'knew', 'how', ""'sing"", 'country', 'SCARED', 'when', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'performed', ""'Long"", 'Black', 'Veil', 'sounded', 'were', ""'channeling"", 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'undeserved', 'compliment', 'truth', 'maybe', 'scared', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'knew', 'songs', 'OK.', 'rambling', 'sue', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'doubt', 'absolute', 'premier', 'showcase', 'displaying', 'talent', ""'ve"", 'even', 'subsequently', 'seen', ""Rob't"", 'Plant', 'REM', 'two', 'musical', 'entities', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'rest', 'lives', 'knowing', 'about', 'even', 'THEY', 'sounded', 'good', 'sort', 'here', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'seven-piece', 'backup', 'band', 'TWO', 'trumpets', 'organic', 'non-synthesizer', 'Ring', 'Fire', 'two', 'not-completely-unexpected', 'vocalists', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'Anita', 'Carter', 'Folks', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'again', 'finest', 'musical', 'milieu', 'just', 'ANY', 'existent', 'performer', 'read', 'what', ""'ve"", 'written', 'Tony', 'Joe', 'White', 'when', 'genius', 'GENTLEMAN', 'nature', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'performs', 'result', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Mr.', 'Cash', 'DVD', 'compiling', 'best', 'ofs', 'own', 'show', 'well', 'possess', 'tape', 'Mr.', 'Cash', '@', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'better', 'still', 'even', 'simply', 'necessity']",N/A
938257,ADES8B01WRPI3,B000B9EYJI,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[7, 8]","I will give this LIVE FROM AUSTIN, TX: JOHNNY CASH on DVD a full 5 star rating, because it is a solid concert performance, but it does have a noticeable flaw in having too many obscure songs in the middle of the show. If not for these obscure songs, which range from ""OK"" to ""Pretty Good,"" then this could have been one of Johnny's best DVD concerts, but as it is, it is still very decent, at times very good, and it is still, I think, the only DVD concert from the 1980's, that I am aware of.Johnny's performance is strong, his singing is good, and he seems to be making a good showing of himself, now 20 years ago, when he seems to be between being middle-aged and elderly.The show starts out strong with four very famous hits, ""Ring of Fire,"" ""Folsom Prison Blues,"" ""Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down,"" and ""Walk the Line."" The momentum slows down for two obscure songs, before coming back strong with a great version of ""Big River.""""I'll Go Somewhere and Sing My Songs Again"" is obscure but very insightful as to where Johhny is in his career at the time of this concert. I think he is at or near the end of his long contractual relationship with Columbia Records. Eventually, he would have minor, but artistically and personally unrewarding success as a member of the four man ""supergroup"" called The Highwaymen, before making it to his last career peak, getting signed to American Recordings and having a hit MTV video and song, in the early to mid-1990s. But this Austin concert in 1987, twenty years ago now, is the beginning of a phase of career uncertainty for Johnny Cash.A few more obscure songs go by, which also include some swear words like ""b*itch"" and ""wh*re"" in the lyrics, sometimes very prominently. This is the weakest part of the concert, unknown, so-so songs with language that make it not family friendly.The show ends strongly, with ""Ghost Riders in the Sky,"" and a good duet with June Carter, ""Where Did We Go Right,"" (the single song featuring June), and then a quick reprise of ""I Walk the Line"" to end the show.You can hear sister Anita Carter singing in the background, and shown briefly in one of the obscure songs (blink and you will miss her, though).This concert is different from many of the Johnny Cash concert DVDs in that it only has one song where a guest performer appears prominently in a song, June in this case. Many of his other great concert DVDs include his personal friends, professional music artists, often doing entire songs by themselves, such as Carl Perkins, Kris Kristofferson, the Statler Brothers, and others. Not so on the Austin, TX DVD.My favorite Johnny Cash live DVDs are IN DENMARK or IN IRELAND, Denmark being some 15 years before this Austin show, and Ireland being more than 5 years after this Austin show. The worst Johnny Cash live DVD is probably BEHIND PRISON WALLS, which features guest artists who have little to nothing to do with Johnny Cash, other than that single concert event, and they take up as much screen time as Johnny Cash does. There is an obscure, b/w DVD called PETE SEEGER'S RAINBOW QUEST: JOHNNY CASH, which has a good, 40 minutes of Johnny and June sitting around, passing around the acoustic guitar with Pete Seeger, which is highly entertaining despite the obscurity of some of the songs.",5,"Solid Performance, Good Singing and Playing, but Too Many Obscure Songs",1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,3272,"['will', 'give', 'LIVE', 'FROM', 'AUSTIN', 'TX', 'JOHNNY', 'CASH', 'DVD', 'full', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'solid', 'concert', 'performance', 'have', 'noticeable', 'flaw', 'having', 'too', 'many', 'obscure', 'songs', 'middle', 'show', 'not', 'obscure', 'songs', 'range', 'OK', 'Pretty', 'Good', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'Johnny', 'best', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'still', 'very', 'decent', 'times', 'very', 'good', 'still', 'think', 'only', 'DVD', 'concert', '1980', 'am', 'aware', 'of.Johnny', 'performance', 'strong', 'singing', 'good', 'be', 'making', 'good', 'showing', 'now', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'be', 'being', 'middle-aged', 'elderly.The', 'show', 'out', 'strong', 'four', 'very', 'famous', 'hits', 'Ring', 'Fire', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'Blues', 'Sunday', 'Mornin', 'Comin', 'Down', 'Walk', 'Line', 'momentum', 'down', 'two', 'obscure', 'songs', 'coming', 'back', 'strong', 'great', 'version', 'Big', 'River', ""'ll"", 'Go', 'Somewhere', 'Sing', 'My', 'Songs', 'Again', 'obscure', 'very', 'insightful', 'where', 'Johhny', 'career', 'time', 'concert', 'think', 'end', 'long', 'contractual', 'relationship', 'Columbia', 'Records', 'Eventually', 'would', 'have', 'minor', 'artistically', 'personally', 'unrewarding', 'success', 'member', 'four', 'man', 'supergroup', 'called', 'Highwaymen', 'making', 'last', 'career', 'peak', 'getting', 'signed', 'American', 'Recordings', 'having', 'hit', 'MTV', 'video', 'song', 'early', 'mid-1990s', 'Austin', 'concert', '1987', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'beginning', 'phase', 'career', 'uncertainty', 'Johnny', 'Cash.A', 'few', 'more', 'obscure', 'songs', 'go', 'also', 'include', 'swear', 'words', 'b*itch', 'wh*re', 'lyrics', 'sometimes', 'very', 'prominently', 'weakest', 'part', 'concert', 'unknown', 'so-so', 'songs', 'language', 'make', 'not', 'family', 'show', 'strongly', 'Ghost', 'Riders', 'Sky', 'good', 'duet', 'June', 'Carter', 'Where', 'Did', 'Go', 'Right', 'single', 'song', 'featuring', 'June', 'then', 'quick', 'reprise', 'Walk', 'Line', 'end', 'show.You', 'can', 'hear', 'sister', 'Anita', 'Carter', 'singing', 'background', 'shown', 'briefly', 'one', 'obscure', 'songs', 'blink', 'will', 'miss', 'though', '.This', 'concert', 'different', 'many', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'where', 'guest', 'performer', 'prominently', 'song', 'June', 'case', 'Many', 'other', 'great', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'include', 'personal', 'friends', 'professional', 'music', 'artists', 'often', 'doing', 'entire', 'songs', 'such', 'Carl', 'Perkins', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'Statler', 'Brothers', 'others', 'Not', 'so', 'Austin', 'TX', 'DVD.My', 'favorite', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'live', 'DVDs', 'are', 'IN', 'DENMARK', 'IN', 'IRELAND', 'Denmark', 'being', '15', 'years', 'Austin', 'show', 'Ireland', 'being', 'more', '5', 'years', 'Austin', 'show', 'worst', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'live', 'DVD', 'probably', 'BEHIND', 'PRISON', 'WALLS', 'guest', 'artists', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'nothing', 'do', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'other', 'single', 'concert', 'event', 'take', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'obscure', 'b/w', 'DVD', 'called', 'PETE', 'SEEGER', 'RAINBOW', 'QUEST', 'JOHNNY', 'CASH', 'good', '40', 'minutes', 'Johnny', 'June', 'sitting', 'around', 'passing', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'obscurity', 'songs']",N/A
