There is a revenge episode by John Wesley Hardin, a relative of Mannen Clements, before the episode with Earp besting Mannen Clements, the cause for the revenge, etc.  Otherwise, the stories are pretty good, the acting is good.  Sound and picture quality are very good.

1086598,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000SK5Z7U,trebe,"[7, 7]","Supposedly based on the actual life of the famous lawman and figure from the West, The Life And Legend of Wyatt Earp: The Complete First Season (1955-56), isn't an action oriented, shoot `em up type western.  Handsome Hugh O'Brien is great in the role, and although he occasionally gets a chance to demonstrate Wyatt Earp's legendary speed at drawing a gun, the instances where he actually shoots his pistol, are generally few and far between.  As a lawman, Earp does his best to uphold the law without resorting to violence, being well aware that his reputation for being extremely fast on the draw, serves to deter most from openly challenging him.  The program may be more of a thinking man's Western, as Wyatt Earp typically uses reason, psychology, and his knowledge of human nature to try and deal with potentially explosive situations, rather than a gun.  The series was apparently quite well received, as it ran for six seasons and produced a whopping 225 episodes.  The first season contains 35 episodes on 5 discs.Hugh O'Brien plays Earp as a classy gentleman, who can get very tough when necessary.  He's extremely likeable, though perhaps too good to be true, as he seems to have few faults.  He's almost always confident and in control, although his emotions do sometimes take over.  How much truth there is in this characterization, and in the stories that are featured, is for expert historians to say.  The real Wyatt Earp usually had a handlebar moustache, which O'Brien certainly does not have (and would probably look quite ridiculous if he did).  Regularly featuring gambling, drinking, crooked schemes, crime, and murder, the program is not exactly ideal family fare, but the lack of violence and gunplay, is a change of pace from a program like The Rifleman, where you could pretty much count on Lucas McCain doing some damage with his rifle in nearly every episode.  Those expecting a little more action may be slightly disappointed, but like most westerns, the program does attempt to provide some life lessons.The first season finds Wyatt Earp reluctantly becoming a lawman in the town of Ellsworth, Kansas after the sheriff is gunned down.  It's not long before he is hired to become the Marshall in Wichita, Kansas.  After bringing some order to the town, Earp moves on to Dodge City, Kansas (the home of Gunsmoke's Matt Dillon) to become the Marshall there in 1876.  Earp's first days in Dodge City are dramatized in the final episode of Season One.This is the wild west, where lack of respect for the law and for any man wearing a badge, is extremely common.  Either Earp's life or his job, seem to be constantly at stake.  Earp has a temper, and is sometimes bullheaded.  He often bumps heads with the local judge, threatening to quit, or putting his job on the line by doing things his way.  Fortunately after a while, he gains the support of a loyal group of deputies to back him up, but things don't seem to go smoothly for very long.  Earp never really establishes a close relationship with any of the other semi-regular characters, and as something of a loner, his moves from town to town occur with no big goodbyes.Wyatt's friendship with Bat Masterson is featured in some early episodes, and then resurfaces much later in the episode ""Bat Masterson Again"".  Bat believes he is in love, but is in danger of being gunned down by a man interested in the same woman.  Wyatt provides some very insightful training in the fine art of shooting, that later saves Masterson's life.  In ""The Pinkertons"", Earp has an encounter with the famous detective Allen Pinkerton, who is portrayed as arrogant and accustomed to throwing his weight around.  However in this story, Wyatt saves Pinkerton's life.  Another notable episode is the season finale, which features Earp's arrival in Dodge City, where numerous troublemakers are already gunning for the new Marshall.  The town is so violent, that Earp ends up shooting almost as many men in one day, than in his entire time in Wichita.  Surviving in Dodge, will be no easy matter for Wyatt Earp.Image quality for the episodes in Season One is quite good for a program some 55 years old.  For whatever reasons, subsequent seasons of the program have not been released.  That's unfortunate, as with Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, the level of action is sure to increase, and he would later establish solid relationships with Bat Masterson, and Doc Holiday.",3,"season one is more of a character study, than a shoot `em up...",1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,4421,"['Supposedly', 'based', 'actual', 'life', 'famous', 'lawman', 'figure', 'West', 'Life', 'Legend', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', '1955-56', ""n't"", 'action', 'oriented', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'type', 'western', 'Handsome', 'Hugh', ""O'Brien"", 'great', 'role', 'occasionally', 'chance', 'demonstrate', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'legendary', 'speed', 'drawing', 'gun', 'instances', 'where', 'actually', 'shoots', 'pistol', 'are', 'generally', 'few', 'far', 'lawman', 'Earp', 'best', 'uphold', 'law', 'resorting', 'violence', 'being', 'well', 'aware', 'reputation', 'being', 'extremely', 'fast', 'draw', 'deter', 'most', 'openly', 'challenging', 'program', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'thinking', 'man', 'Western', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'typically', 'reason', 'psychology', 'knowledge', 'human', 'nature', 'try', 'deal', 'potentially', 'explosive', 'situations', 'rather', 'gun', 'series', 'was', 'apparently', 'quite', 'well', 'received', 'ran', 'six', 'seasons', 'produced', 'whopping', '225', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', '35', 'episodes', '5', 'discs.Hugh', ""O'Brien"", 'Earp', 'classy', 'gentleman', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'very', 'tough', 'when', 'necessary', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'perhaps', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'have', 'few', 'faults', 'almost', 'always', 'confident', 'control', 'emotions', 'do', 'sometimes', 'take', 'over', 'How', 'much', 'truth', 'characterization', 'stories', 'are', 'featured', 'expert', 'historians', 'say', 'real', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'usually', 'had', 'handlebar', 'moustache', ""O'Brien"", 'certainly', 'not', 'have', 'would', 'probably', 'look', 'quite', 'ridiculous', 'did', 'Regularly', 'featuring', 'gambling', 'drinking', 'crooked', 'schemes', 'crime', 'murder', 'program', 'not', 'exactly', 'ideal', 'family', 'fare', 'lack', 'violence', 'gunplay', 'change', 'pace', 'program', 'Rifleman', 'where', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'count', 'Lucas', 'McCain', 'doing', 'damage', 'rifle', 'nearly', 'episode', 'expecting', 'little', 'more', 'action', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'most', 'westerns', 'program', 'attempt', 'provide', 'life', 'lessons.The', 'first', 'season', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'reluctantly', 'becoming', 'lawman', 'town', 'Ellsworth', 'Kansas', 'sheriff', 'gunned', 'down', 'not', 'long', 'hired', 'become', 'Marshall', 'Wichita', 'Kansas', 'bringing', 'order', 'town', 'Earp', 'Dodge', 'City', 'Kansas', 'home', 'Gunsmoke', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'become', 'Marshall', '1876', 'Earp', 'first', 'days', 'Dodge', 'City', 'are', 'dramatized', 'final', 'episode', 'Season', 'One.This', 'wild', 'west', 'where', 'lack', 'respect', 'law', 'man', 'wearing', 'badge', 'extremely', 'common', 'Earp', 'life', 'job', 'seem', 'be', 'constantly', 'stake', 'Earp', 'temper', 'sometimes', 'bullheaded', 'often', 'heads', 'local', 'judge', 'threatening', 'quit', 'putting', 'job', 'line', 'doing', 'things', 'way', 'Fortunately', 'while', 'gains', 'support', 'loyal', 'group', 'deputies', 'back', 'up', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'smoothly', 'very', 'long', 'Earp', 'never', 'really', 'close', 'relationship', 'other', 'semi-regular', 'characters', 'something', 'loner', 'moves', 'town', 'town', 'occur', 'big', 'goodbyes.Wyatt', 'friendship', 'Bat', 'Masterson', 'featured', 'early', 'episodes', 'then', 'resurfaces', 'much', 'later', 'episode', 'Bat', 'Masterson', 'Again', 'Bat', 'love', 'danger', 'being', 'gunned', 'down', 'man', 'interested', 'same', 'woman', 'Wyatt', 'very', 'insightful', 'training', 'fine', 'art', 'shooting', 'later', 'saves', 'Masterson', 'life', 'Pinkertons', 'Earp', 'encounter', 'famous', 'detective', 'Allen', 'Pinkerton', 'who', 'portrayed', 'arrogant', 'accustomed', 'throwing', 'weight', 'around', 'However', 'story', 'Wyatt', 'Pinkerton', 'life', 'notable', 'episode', 'season', 'finale', 'Earp', 'arrival', 'Dodge', 'City', 'where', 'numerous', 'troublemakers', 'are', 'already', 'gunning', 'new', 'Marshall', 'town', 'so', 'violent', 'Earp', 'up', 'shooting', 'almost', 'many', 'men', 'one', 'day', 'entire', 'time', 'Wichita', 'Surviving', 'Dodge', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'matter', 'Wyatt', 'Earp.Image', 'quality', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'quite', 'good', 'program', '55', 'years', 'old', 'reasons', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'program', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'unfortunate', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Dodge', 'City', 'level', 'action', 'sure', 'increase', 'would', 'later', 'establish', 'solid', 'relationships', 'Bat', 'Masterson', 'Doc', 'Holiday']",N/A
