1299438,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002ZCDT0O,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","There's a fleeting shot here of a guy who has a blade plunge into his face, so while ALADIN for the most part does pass as a children's movie, there are one or two moments to watch out for. This is Bollywood's adaptation of that classic Arabian Nights tale, and Disney shouldn't fret and fear competition. Not when the Bollywood genie emerges and we learn that his name is... Genius. As a play on words, this kinda sucks.This time out, a Bollywood picture exhibits special effects that are on par with Hollywood's. The most disappointing thing is that the screenplay fails to take advantage of the nifty bells and whistles. ALADIN opens with such promise but then, half an hour into it, degenerates into routine Bollywood escapism.Aladin Chatterjee (Riteish Deshmukh) has lived in Khwaish all his life. He's an orphan and one of them sad sacks, so passive that he's allowed a childhood bully to continue abusing him. Apparently, that gag where Kasim (Sahil Khan) and his gang force Aladin to rub lamps never gets old.The plot thickens when a beautiful new student named Jasmine (Jacqueline Fernandez) arrives at Aladin's college, and on his birthday. The ever-enterprising Kasim organizes a birthday party for Aladin to impress Jasmine. Kasim convinces Jasmine that Aladin would love a lamp as a birthday present. The mortified Aladin accepts the gift and Jasmine coaxes him into rubbing it. That does the trick. Cue the Big B, Amitabh Bachchan, looking very dapper in an assortment of fedora hats and flashy suits.There's an impish side to Big B which has always contrasted with the regal demeanor he exudes on screen. He unleashes this playfulness with this role. Nothing says over-the-top like a rapping Amitabh Bachchan (it's weird to hear him say stuff like: ""I got the shorties jumpin'""). Thankfully, he doesn't try to match Robin Williams' frenetic energy. As Genius, Big B pesters Aladin to come up with three wishes and soon, lest Genius' genie contract be extended for another million years.I like Riteish Deshmukh. He's a natural at playing these put-upon roles, and he certainly pines with the best of them. The problem is that his character is such a limp milquetoast that it's frustrating. And the three wishes he makes? I had hoped that the writers would introduce a new twist with the wish-making, but that doesn't happen. Aladin pretty much wastes his wishes on the same thing. And that's the problem with the film. It looks gorgeous. The CG stuff is neat. But I expected more from the cast. The story beats are staged in dull fashion. There's a low point in the film in which Genius, in accord with tons of Indian cinema heroes, demonstrates proficiency with martial arts. Given, there IS a cool factor in seeing the Big B kick butt, but it just smacks of lazy writing. Jacqueline Fernandez is new to the game but I wish she had more to do than just stand there looking stunning and glamorous. The romantic arc oozes familiarity, and the story doesn't at all convince me that she really could fall for Aladin. Except for Aladin's (but, really, Genius') serenading of Jasmine in ""You May Be,"" I wasn't feelin' the musical numbers which came off as strident and trying too hard.There's a parallel plotline concerning an evil ex-genie who styles himself ""The Ringmaster,"" and he's played at low simmer by Sanjay Dutt. The Ringmaster plans on regaining his magical powers and he means to do this by catching the reflection of a comet which only passes over Earth every million years. He's toadied up to by a crew of freaky circus performers (which I thought was a nice, colorful touch). Not too surprisingly, the Ringmaster has something to do with Aladin's being an orphan. Would it surprise you to know that Genius was also involved?In the end ALADIN isn't a bad film; it could've been better. Here's Indian cinema catching up to the rest of the world in terms of its filmmaking technology. I feel that a bit more effort with the script would've produced a much superior story and would've drawn out better performances from the cast. But the kids will probably like it, anyway. And I did love the acknowledgement boom which you hear when Aladin makes a wish. That's another nice touch.This is a 2-disc set. Disc 1 has the film (with options for English sub-titles and to jump directly to the musical numbers). Disc 2 has the following bonus features (total running time: 01:08:44 minutes):- Making of ALADIN (cast & crew conducting interviews mostly in English)- Making of the Songs- ""Giri Giri"" Music Video- 2 Theatrical Trailers- Visual Effects Showreel",3,where rubbing a lamp isn't just a euphemism,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,4572,"['fleeting', 'shot', 'here', 'guy', 'who', 'blade', 'plunge', 'face', 'so', 'ALADIN', 'most', 'part', 'pass', 'children', 'movie', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'watch', 'out', 'Bollywood', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'tale', 'Disney', 'should', ""n't"", 'fret', 'fear', 'competition', 'Not', 'when', 'Bollywood', 'genie', 'emerges', 'learn', 'name', 'Genius', 'play', 'words', 'kinda', 'sucks.This', 'time', 'out', 'Bollywood', 'picture', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'par', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'screenplay', 'take', 'advantage', 'nifty', 'bells', 'whistles', 'ALADIN', 'such', 'promise', 'then', 'hour', 'routine', 'Bollywood', 'escapism.Aladin', 'Chatterjee', 'Riteish', 'Deshmukh', 'lived', 'Khwaish', 'life', 'orphan', 'one', 'sad', 'sacks', 'so', 'passive', 'allowed', 'childhood', 'bully', 'continue', 'abusing', 'Apparently', 'gag', 'where', 'Kasim', 'Sahil', 'Khan', 'gang', 'force', 'Aladin', 'rub', 'lamps', 'never', 'old.The', 'plot', 'thickens', 'when', 'beautiful', 'new', 'student', 'named', 'Jasmine', 'Jacqueline', 'Fernandez', 'Aladin', 'college', 'birthday', 'ever-enterprising', 'Kasim', 'birthday', 'party', 'Aladin', 'impress', 'Jasmine', 'Kasim', 'convinces', 'Jasmine', 'Aladin', 'would', 'love', 'lamp', 'birthday', 'present', 'mortified', 'Aladin', 'gift', 'Jasmine', 'coaxes', 'rubbing', 'trick', 'Cue', 'Big', 'B', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'looking', 'very', 'dapper', 'assortment', 'fedora', 'hats', 'flashy', 'impish', 'side', 'Big', 'B', 'always', 'contrasted', 'regal', 'demeanor', 'screen', 'playfulness', 'role', 'Nothing', 'over-the-top', 'rapping', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'weird', 'hear', 'say', 'stuff', 'got', 'shorties', 'jumpin', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'try', 'match', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'frenetic', 'energy', 'Genius', 'Big', 'B', 'pesters', 'Aladin', 'come', 'up', 'three', 'wishes', 'soon', 'lest', 'Genius', 'genie', 'contract', 'be', 'extended', 'million', 'years.I', 'Riteish', 'Deshmukh', 'natural', 'playing', 'put-upon', 'roles', 'certainly', 'best', 'problem', 'character', 'such', 'limp', 'milquetoast', 'frustrating', 'three', 'wishes', 'had', 'hoped', 'writers', 'would', 'introduce', 'new', 'twist', 'wish-making', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Aladin', 'pretty', 'much', 'wishes', 'same', 'thing', 'problem', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'CG', 'stuff', 'neat', 'expected', 'more', 'cast', 'story', 'beats', 'are', 'staged', 'dull', 'fashion', 'low', 'point', 'film', 'Genius', 'accord', 'tons', 'Indian', 'cinema', 'heroes', 'proficiency', 'martial', 'arts', 'Given', 'cool', 'factor', 'seeing', 'Big', 'B', 'kick', 'butt', 'just', 'smacks', 'lazy', 'writing', 'Jacqueline', 'Fernandez', 'new', 'game', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'just', 'stand', 'there', 'looking', 'stunning', 'glamorous', 'romantic', 'arc', 'familiarity', 'story', ""n't"", 'convince', 'really', 'could', 'fall', 'Aladin', 'Aladin', 'really', 'Genius', 'serenading', 'Jasmine', 'May', 'Be', 'was', ""n't"", 'feelin', 'musical', 'numbers', 'came', 'off', 'strident', 'trying', 'too', 'parallel', 'plotline', 'concerning', 'evil', 'ex-genie', 'who', 'Ringmaster', 'played', 'low', 'simmer', 'Sanjay', 'Dutt', 'Ringmaster', 'plans', 'regaining', 'magical', 'powers', 'do', 'catching', 'reflection', 'comet', 'only', 'Earth', 'million', 'years', 'toadied', 'crew', 'freaky', 'circus', 'performers', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'colorful', 'touch', 'Not', 'too', 'surprisingly', 'Ringmaster', 'something', 'do', 'Aladin', 'being', 'orphan', 'Would', 'surprise', 'know', 'Genius', 'was', 'also', 'involved', 'end', 'ALADIN', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'Here', 'Indian', 'cinema', 'catching', 'up', 'rest', 'world', 'terms', 'filmmaking', 'technology', 'feel', 'bit', 'more', 'effort', 'script', 'would', ""'ve"", 'produced', 'much', 'superior', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'drawn', 'out', 'better', 'performances', 'cast', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'anyway', 'did', 'love', 'acknowledgement', 'boom', 'hear', 'when', 'Aladin', 'wish', 'nice', 'touch.This', '2-disc', 'set', 'Disc', '1', 'film', 'options', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'jump', 'directly', 'musical', 'numbers', '2', 'following', 'bonus', 'features', 'total', 'running', 'time', '01:08:44', 'minutes', 'Making', 'ALADIN', 'cast', 'crew', 'conducting', 'interviews', 'mostly', 'English', 'Making', 'Songs-', 'Giri', 'Giri', 'Music', 'Video-', '2', 'Theatrical', 'Trailers-', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'Showreel']",Aladin
