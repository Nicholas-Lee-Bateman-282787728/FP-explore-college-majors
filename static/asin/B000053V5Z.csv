565085,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000053V5Z,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[8, 8]","""Early to Bed, Early to Rise"" is another in a series of ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" video releases ported to DVD. This DVD includes two episodes from the video release ---  ""Go to Sleep"" and ""Morning Glory"" and adds in ""A Winter's Nap.""""Go to Sleep""Ojo stays over for the night at the Big Blue House. Bear helps her to get to sleep and then decides to turn in himself, when the doorbell rings. It turns out that his friends Jeremiah and Doc Hog have shown up for a card game, which Bear completely forgot about. Now Bear has to take care of them, while also seeing that Ojo isn't disturbed, as well as Tutter, who's sleeping in his mousehole. Featuring a great song from Shadow, ""Rockabye,"" about how shadows watch over you at night.""Morning Glory""Bear helps everybody in the Big Blue House to get up in the morning after a sleepover, but some have more trouble rising than others. Once everybody is up, though, they're ready and raring for morning activities --- but not before enjoying a nice breakfast. Treelo just wants to play, play, play, but Bear and everyone else manage to convince him that it would be better to have some breakfast first. Featuring an old-favorite ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" song --- ""Brush Brush Bree.""""A Winter's Nap""Winter has come to Woodland Valley and Bear would like nothing more than a nice nap. However, he never quite seems to make it to the nap, as he has to help out his friends in the Big Blue House. Sleep evades Bear, but his friends have a nice surprise for him.Like all of the other ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" DVDs, there aren't really any good special features on this. You only get the option to jump to songs from the episodes and previews for other Disney TV Shows and movies.",4,The Early Bear Gets the...

565087,A1BKMYEQ6BP5B5,B000053V5Z,"Maria Beadnell ""gotlips""","[2, 2]","Criteria for a children's video:1. Do kids like it? Yes, my toddler loves this, sings along, and asks me to sing along, too.2.  Can the parents watch it without going bonkers?  Yep, so far, so good, every time I see it again I notice new things.  The puppets are sophisticated and the characters distinct. The music is fabulous, mostly inspired by modern American folk--how great to hear simple fiddle music and guitar instead of overproduced ""showtunes."" The simple music also means that if I sing the songs afterward, it sounds close to what my child remembers from the show.3. Since kids will copy anything they see on TV or in a book, what is going on in this video?  Gentle humor, good manners, good music. All things I'm glad to see her emulate.That's the bare bones (ha!) of liking this series.  But it goes beyond the basic.  __Bear__ has subtle messages about food, getting along, and social differences.  For instance, in one episode, Tutter the mouse is eating a sandwich, which he must learn to share. OK, we could see that coming. BUT! Without making a big deal over, it, the producers made the sandwich on whole wheat bread, quietly supporting good nutrition.Another example or two; when Ojo the bear cub sleeps over, Bear makes her bed, very cozy, on the couch. When they have a birthday party (in a different episode), it's home made decorations and one meaningful present. A quiet message that you don't have to have a great deal of money to have a good time.And there are significant female characters (Ojo, Shadow, Luna) who aren't made into gooey subservients as in so many kids videos (or feature films, for that matter).Bear is the leader of the series, but often sings harmony to some other character, giving a simple message that you don't always have to be number one.Hooray for Bear!",5,Witty and friendly and funny,1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,1809,"['Criteria', 'children', 'video:1', 'Do', 'kids', 'Yes', 'toddler', 'sings', 'sing', 'along', 'too.2', 'Can', 'parents', 'watch', 'going', 'bonkers', 'Yep', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'time', 'see', 'again', 'notice', 'new', 'things', 'puppets', 'are', 'sophisticated', 'characters', 'distinct', 'music', 'fabulous', 'mostly', 'inspired', 'modern', 'American', 'folk', 'how', 'great', 'hear', 'simple', 'fiddle', 'music', 'guitar', 'instead', 'overproduced', 'showtunes', 'simple', 'music', 'also', 'sing', 'songs', 'afterward', 'close', 'what', 'child', 'remembers', 'show.3', 'kids', 'will', 'copy', 'anything', 'see', 'TV', 'book', 'what', 'going', 'video', 'Gentle', 'humor', 'good', 'manners', 'good', 'music', 'things', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'bare', 'bones', 'ha', 'liking', 'series', 'basic', '__Bear__', 'subtle', 'messages', 'food', 'getting', 'along', 'social', 'differences', 'instance', 'one', 'episode', 'Tutter', 'mouse', 'eating', 'sandwich', 'must', 'learn', 'share', 'OK', 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'BUT', 'making', 'big', 'deal', 'producers', 'made', 'sandwich', 'whole', 'wheat', 'bread', 'quietly', 'supporting', 'good', 'nutrition.Another', 'example', 'two', 'when', 'Ojo', 'bear', 'cub', 'sleeps', 'Bear', 'bed', 'very', 'cozy', 'couch', 'When', 'have', 'birthday', 'party', 'different', 'episode', 'home', 'made', 'decorations', 'one', 'meaningful', 'present', 'quiet', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'money', 'have', 'good', 'time.And', 'are', 'significant', 'female', 'characters', 'Ojo', 'Shadow', 'Luna', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'gooey', 'subservients', 'so', 'many', 'kids', 'videos', 'feature', 'films', 'matter', '.Bear', 'leader', 'series', 'often', 'harmony', 'other', 'character', 'giving', 'simple', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'be', 'number', 'one.Hooray', 'Bear']","Bear in the Big Blue House - Early to Bed, Early to Rise VHS"

The bed habits, which seemed more like ""how much can I stall before I go to bed"" or procrastinate, were not exactly what I wanted my son to learn.  I just did not like this video at all.
