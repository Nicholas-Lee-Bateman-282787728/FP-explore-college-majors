Now, before you all get excited, doesn't look like any way to actually get the video to your TV, etc.  using this ""service"".  If there were a way to knock this down to a ""0"" rating, I would at this point.Old Review:Well, watched the first season via Amazon streaming, it was decent, there were a few WTF moments that were disruptive, some of the characters you're like ""why in the world would this guy put up with this woman"", or ""if he really cared for this person, why in the world would he be messing with her this way?""Still and all, other than a touch too much emo at points and a certain amount of hubris on the parts of the characters, I enjoyed it a lot.Season 2, sat down, tried to order it, no joy...  waited a couple of weeks, no joy...  likely years later will be the same.Amazon instant at that point went from becoming my go-to for cord cutting, to ""well, I'll get around to looking for it there, it might show up.""(I mean, it's not like I wasn't willing to pay a reasonable, competitive price for it.)DVD ""came out"", and the price was ridiculous.Of course, by this time, I was able to find the season on the internet and watch it that way.Saved myself some bucks as it was still fairly good, and there were a couple of episodes I would have loved to have around....  But, if you base the whole season off of one story and that story doesn't click with the viewers (which is what happened in my case), you lose a viewer, you lose a ""fan"".Overall, if you buy into a whole season of legal finagling about a completely botched reporting on a military event, you'd likely like this thing.  Cast is on point, relationships.... well, crappier than in season 1 honestly, didn't care for a lot of that.I'd give it a 3 (by itself, no amazon involvement), price they're asking is way too high, too emo for my tastes.",1,Mainly Amazon's Fault on this rating,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,2004,"['Update', 'Interesting', 'note', 'are', 'UK', 'amazon', 'user', 'AMAZON.CO.UK', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'other', 'screwed', 'up', 'USA', 'videos', 'offered', 'immediate', 'purchase', 'review', 'there', 'Now', 'get', 'excited', ""n't"", 'look', 'way', 'actually', 'get', 'video', 'TV', 'etc', 'using', 'service', 'were', 'way', 'knock', 'down', '0', 'rating', 'would', 'point.Old', 'Review', 'Well', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'Amazon', 'streaming', 'was', 'decent', 'were', 'few', 'WTF', 'moments', 'were', 'disruptive', 'characters', ""'re"", 'why', 'world', 'would', 'guy', 'put', 'up', 'woman', 'really', 'cared', 'person', 'why', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'messing', 'way', 'Still', 'other', 'touch', 'too', 'much', 'emo', 'points', 'certain', 'amount', 'hubris', 'parts', 'characters', 'enjoyed', 'lot.Season', '2', 'sat', 'down', 'tried', 'order', 'joy', 'waited', 'couple', 'weeks', 'joy', 'likely', 'years', 'later', 'will', 'be', 'same.Amazon', 'instant', 'point', 'went', 'becoming', 'go-to', 'cord', 'cutting', 'well', ""'ll"", 'get', 'looking', 'there', 'might', 'show', 'up', 'mean', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'willing', 'pay', 'reasonable', 'competitive', 'price', 'came', 'out', 'price', 'was', 'ridiculous.Of', 'course', 'time', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'season', 'internet', 'watch', 'way.Saved', 'bucks', 'was', 'still', 'fairly', 'good', 'were', 'couple', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'around', 'base', 'whole', 'season', 'one', 'story', 'story', ""n't"", 'click', 'viewers', 'what', 'happened', 'case', 'lose', 'viewer', 'lose', 'fan', '.Overall', 'buy', 'whole', 'season', 'legal', 'finagling', 'completely', 'botched', 'reporting', 'military', 'event', ""'d"", 'likely', 'thing', 'Cast', 'point', 'relationships', 'well', 'crappier', 'season', '1', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'lot', 'that.I', ""'d"", 'give', '3', 'amazon', 'involvement', 'price', ""'re"", 'asking', 'way', 'too', 'high', 'too', 'emo', 'tastes']",The Newsroom: The Complete Second Season

1663892,A4WEZJOIZIV4U,B00E3HDW3I,"Chuck Bittner ""Disabled comedian & gamer!""","[20, 23]",I really enjoyed season one and season two is great yet again. I think Aaron Sorkin has really stepped up his game and you can see how he's matured as a writer since his time since The West Wing.The thing I really love about the Newsroom is how introduces me to the world of nightly news that I never really knew existed (well in my defense I knew it existed but I didn't know exactly how it operated) and I like that similar to what The West Wing did for White House politics. Now I do know that this is a work of fiction but I do like how Aaron Sorkin shows us how the gears operate behind the scenes of things we just see or affect us every day. And the newsroom is great for that I.E. learning what a red team is and how a news crews use them is just one very cool aspect of the show.And the acting is amazing Jeff Daniels really knocks it out of the park (it's kind of funny to think that he was actually in Dumber and Dumber) uses the great actor and really solidifies in the role of Will McAvoy.One thing to note season two is told out of order and has a series of flashbacks throughout the season which kind it can be confusing. So you'll definitely want to keep track of the dates and when things are happening otherwise you might get lost like I was for a few episodes. And what I mean lost I just didn't know when things were happening in the stream of time.Thanks for reading and enjoy the show!,5,Another great season for a great show!,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,1407,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'great', 'yet', 'again', 'think', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'really', 'stepped', 'up', 'game', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'matured', 'writer', 'time', 'West', 'Wing.The', 'thing', 'really', 'love', 'Newsroom', 'how', 'introduces', 'world', 'nightly', 'news', 'never', 'really', 'knew', 'existed', 'well', 'defense', 'knew', 'existed', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'operated', 'like', 'similar', 'what', 'West', 'Wing', 'did', 'White', 'House', 'politics', 'Now', 'do', 'know', 'work', 'fiction', 'do', 'how', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'how', 'gears', 'operate', 'scenes', 'things', 'just', 'see', 'affect', 'day', 'newsroom', 'great', 'I.E', 'learning', 'what', 'red', 'team', 'how', 'news', 'crews', 'use', 'just', 'one', 'very', 'cool', 'aspect', 'show.And', 'acting', 'amazing', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'really', 'park', 'kind', 'funny', 'think', 'was', 'actually', 'Dumber', 'Dumber', 'great', 'actor', 'really', 'solidifies', 'role', 'Will', 'McAvoy.One', 'thing', 'note', 'season', 'two', 'told', 'order', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'season', 'kind', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'keep', 'track', 'dates', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'otherwise', 'might', 'get', 'lost', 'was', 'few', 'episodes', 'what', 'mean', 'lost', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'happening', 'stream', 'time.Thanks', 'reading', 'enjoy', 'show']",The Newsroom: The Complete Second Season

As someone else has already pointed out, Jeff Daniel's character wouldn't be smoking, he would be spouting the facts that tobacco kills 500,000 smokers and, more importantly, 65,000 innocent Americans (who were exposed to a witch's brew of carcinogens and poisons from others' tobacco smoke)!If Will or anyone else there was caught smoking, more than one person working there would have called the Health Department and it would have been stopped immediately.So, why is smoking included in The Newsroom? Is the creator of this show or one or more of the writers a smoker? Even worse, in the last episode we've seen, after Sam Waterson's character admonishes Will on his smoking (""Why don't you just set yourself on fire?""), he then takes the cigarette and smokes it himself!I wonder if anyone would be complaining if Daniel's character had an addiction of putting his hands down the blouse or up the dress of all the women which entered his office or urinating on them?We've now stopped watching this program and will not be purchasing the DVDs, of course.Clean up your act, HBO!",1,Otherwise great show RUINED by use of tobacco drug!,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,1203,"['enjoyed', 'series', 'first', 'episode', 'included', 'totally', 'place', 'unnecessary', 'use', 'tobacco', 'drug', 'someone', 'else', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'Jeff', 'Daniel', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'smoking', 'would', 'be', 'spouting', 'facts', 'tobacco', '500,000', 'smokers', 'more', 'importantly', '65,000', 'innocent', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'exposed', 'witch', 'brew', 'carcinogens', 'poisons', 'others', 'tobacco', 'smoke', 'Will', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'caught', 'smoking', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'working', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'called', 'Health', 'Department', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stopped', 'immediately.So', 'why', 'smoking', 'included', 'Newsroom', 'creator', 'show', 'one', 'more', 'writers', 'smoker', 'Even', 'worse', 'last', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sam', 'Waterson', 'character', 'admonishes', 'Will', 'smoking', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'set', 'fire', 'then', 'cigarette', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'complaining', 'Daniel', 'character', 'had', 'addiction', 'putting', 'hands', 'down', 'blouse', 'dress', 'women', 'entered', 'office', 'urinating', ""'ve"", 'now', 'stopped', 'watching', 'program', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'purchasing', 'DVDs', 'course.Clean', 'act', 'HBO']",The Newsroom: The Complete Second Season

What craftmansship! Both actors and writers. Why is HBO shutting down the series? The third season must already be in the can. So the actors have most likely moved on. Aside from making a top quality production was Sorkin actually making a statement about the political shape and direction of this Country? Did it have (the series) a sufficient effect to help the current President and party to prevail over the Republicans and the Tea Party? If so is that the reason that HBO may have been pressured to cancel the series? I don't think that is a wild assertion but a great question.

I guess no one ever gave him the chance. Seeing this side of Daniels was a bit shocking at first. I was like.....""WOW, where did this come from?"" He is witty, intelligent, sharp as a tack and is nothing less than impressive. Very impressive.This shows relies on two things and one of them is strong acting from all. The cast delivers and delivers well. The other thing is writing. This is one of the best written shows on TV with strong actors capable of delivering well written scripts. The dialogue is fast, funny, intelligent and their timing is well executed. The scripts reflect today's current events which makes it even more fun. I have not seen a TV program with this level of well delivered scripts since Gilmore Girls.This show is not one that you can casually watch while doing other things....like playing on the computer.

1663900,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,B00E3HDW3I,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[84, 91]","The second season of HBO's NEWSROOM picks up where last season leaves off. However, unlike shows like TRUE BLOOD, there's no cliffhanger from season 1 that needs resolving. So if you haven't watched season 1, you can jump right in without feeling overwhelmed by complicated plots, and various character's backstories. All you need to know is that its a story about the characters who bring us the nightly news on ATLANTA CABLE NEWS (ACN, representing apparently a mash up of CNN and NBC.) Jeff Daniels is Will McAvoy, the news ancor who called ""THE TEA PARTY"" the ""American Taliban"", has a romantic history with his producer, Mackenzie. The other romantic backstory involves Maggie, a fact checker in the newsroom, played by the lovely Alison Pill. She is torn between her live-in boyfriend from season 1, Don Keefer, a producer in the newsroom, and her REAL love, Jim Harper, who's also a producer. The other two main characters include Sloan Sabbith, who's a super genius economist with her own news show on the economy. Sloan is beautiful, and socially awkward since her intelligence puts guys off. And finally there's Neal, a young guy who runs the ACN internet page, and monitors Will's blog.Season TWO opens in early 2012 with a conference involving the company Lawyers, and the newsroom cast, over a wrongful termination suite. During the first ten minutes of the new season, we discover that the temporary news producer who was hired to cover for Jim Harper, was fired for bringing a fake story to ACN, that concerned the US military using chemical weapons in Afghanistan. Mistakenly reporting that the US military committed war crimes, has serious consequences. But how did this happen? Well, there's a replacement news producer filling in for Jim Harper, who needed time off. Jim could no longer face Maggie, his secret love, at work. So Jim is allowed to be a normal reporter on Mitt Romney's bus. Meanwhile, Maggie decides she also needs to get away from the Newsroom, so she volunteers to cover a story in Africa, where a horrible tragedy involving orphans devastates her. The only back story from season one that plays out in season two, involves Jim and Maggie's hidden love for each other being revealed during a drunken confessional in public, which was secretly video taped and placed on Youtube. Jim's girlfriend, and Maggie's boyfriend (Don Keefer)both saw the video on youtube, and break ups ensue. Also lingering from season 1, Mackenzie comes ONE MORE STEP closer to discovering that Will is still in love with her.The entire season 2 story arc occurs during 5 days, during which we are shown how the ACN news team tries to vet a seemingly reliable allegation about the military's use of chemical weapons. Needless to say, the story was bogus but was reported on the nightly news, and everybody is in serious hot water. Along with that, minor subplots concern Neal's coverage of OCCUPY WALLSTREET, and Jim's coverage of Romney's presidential election campaign. As in season one, the drama of interpersonal relationships at the workplace, while covering hot news stories, is the motor behind the whole show. But why do people love the NEWSROOM? Because its smart. THE NEWSROOM concerns highly intelligent, sophisticated New Yorkers leading their personal and professional lives, in the post 9/11 world. The relationships, like the news stories, are firmly grounded in realism, but with a nice dose of snarky comedy, tied to personal insight. Best of all, we're given a balanced, philosophical albeit cynical overview of our world's news. Its riveting, without pandering to sensationalist melodrama, or involving supernatural elements. (Nobody's a vampire, an alien, a psychic, or a secret cyborg. At least, we don't think so...)
