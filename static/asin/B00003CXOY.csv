The director of this movie, Joel Schumacher, is one of the most irregular directors that you can find in these days. The same he makes a movie as effective as ""Tigerland"" or a piece of junk like ""Batman & Robin"", the same he makes an amusing movie like ""Phone Booth"" than he makes a lame movie like ""Flawless"".But ""Tigerland"" is a welcome addition to the extensive war movies catalog. Although is not one of the top classics as ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"" or ""Platoon"", it's better than the average war flick. The central character of ""Tigerland"" is played by the up-and-coming Colin Farrell, and he does a good job as the rebel Roland Bozz.""Tigerland"" is a well done and worthy movie, one of the few times where Joel Schumacher did a good job.

This film is about the loyalty, integrity, fear and hope of men. I believe that the Vietnam War is simply used as a backdrop. This is an intense, psychological film. The plot isn't that great, but it's what Bozz's character that helps this film a very emotional piece. I'd say Colin Farrell is the next Mel Gibson, if not probably even better.

530668,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXOY,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I think Joel Schumacher will forever be linked to those atrocious Batman films he directed.  Couple that with a few failed, albeit ambitious, projects like `The Phantom of the Opera' and a slew of entertaining yet seriously flawed (and unapologetically so) attempts at `serious cinema' like `A Time to Kill', `Phone Booth' and `8MM' and you have the resume of a man who has seemingly squandered his potential for a quick dollar.But, there will always be `Tigerland'.1971...Vietnam...training camp Tigerland...Louisiana...welcome.Private Roland Bozz, drafted and unhappy about it, drifts through his routine with agitated intensity.  He has a gift, a gift that doesn't go unnoticed, but it is a gift misused at his own guile.  Private Jim Paxton is in a different boat, yet similar in ways.  Wishing to write about the war first hand, he enlists to gain the knowledge, a knowledge he was unprepared to understand.But understand he shall.The scripts beauty lies in the way that it creates such tension without ever truly breaking into the action of it all.  The way that these characters are internally destroyed by their own anxieties over the inevitable is outstanding.  It reminds me, in almost a reverse way, of `Jarhead', a film that exposed those anxiously awaiting the violence.  In `Tigerland' we see those anxiously dreading the violence.What makes `Tigerland' tick is the astute direction.  Seriously, what Schumacher accomplishes here is outstanding.  There is so much control here over the gritty surroundings, and the raw intensity that he is able to tap into proves that he has talent under that Hollywoodized faade.  The aggressive nature of the set helps make Tigerland itself a character in the film, giving it a face and a personality and a `feeling' all its own.  The performances are also top notch here, especially from a fresh faced Colin Farrell, who just sizzles with potential.  It's beautiful to see him finally embrace that potential all these years later (his recent string of work, most notable `In Bruges' and `Ondine', are sensational `gifts' from this actor).  The way he unwraps Bozz's persona for the audience is concentrated and unforgettable.But the entire ensemble truly sings here.In the end, this may truly be Schumacher's masterpiece.  I know that that really isn't saying a whole lot (considering the man's resume), but the fact still remains that `Tigerland' is the cumulative result of all of the directors and actors strengths meshing beautifully together.",5,A gritty offering from an unlikely source...,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,2498,"['think', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'linked', 'atrocious', 'Batman', 'films', 'directed', 'Couple', 'few', 'failed', 'albeit', 'ambitious', 'projects', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'slew', 'entertaining', 'yet', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'unapologetically', 'so', 'attempts', 'serious', 'cinema', 'Time', 'Kill', 'Phone', 'Booth', '8MM', 'have', 'resume', 'man', 'who', 'seemingly', 'squandered', 'potential', 'quick', 'dollar.But', 'will', 'always', 'be', ""Tigerland'.1971"", 'Vietnam', 'training', 'camp', 'Tigerland', 'Louisiana', 'welcome.Private', 'Roland', 'Bozz', 'drafted', 'unhappy', 'routine', 'agitated', 'intensity', 'gift', 'gift', ""n't"", 'go', 'unnoticed', 'gift', 'misused', 'own', 'guile', 'Private', 'Jim', 'Paxton', 'different', 'boat', 'yet', 'similar', 'ways', 'Wishing', 'write', 'war', 'first', 'hand', 'gain', 'knowledge', 'knowledge', 'was', 'unprepared', 'understand.But', 'understand', 'scripts', 'beauty', 'way', 'such', 'tension', 'ever', 'truly', 'breaking', 'action', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'internally', 'destroyed', 'own', 'anxieties', 'inevitable', 'outstanding', 'almost', 'reverse', 'way', 'Jarhead', 'film', 'exposed', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'violence', 'Tigerland', 'see', 'anxiously', 'dreading', 'violence.What', 'Tigerland', 'tick', 'astute', 'direction', 'Seriously', 'what', 'Schumacher', 'here', 'outstanding', 'so', 'much', 'control', 'here', 'gritty', 'surroundings', 'raw', 'intensity', 'able', 'tap', 'proves', 'talent', 'Hollywoodized', 'faade', 'aggressive', 'nature', 'set', 'make', 'Tigerland', 'character', 'film', 'giving', 'face', 'personality', 'feeling', 'own', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'here', 'especially', 'fresh', 'faced', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'just', 'sizzles', 'potential', 'beautiful', 'see', 'finally', 'embrace', 'potential', 'years', 'later', 'recent', 'string', 'work', 'most', 'notable', 'Bruges', 'Ondine', 'are', 'sensational', 'gifts', 'actor', 'way', 'Bozz', 'persona', 'audience', 'concentrated', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'truly', 'sings', 'here.In', 'end', 'may', 'truly', 'be', 'Schumacher', 'masterpiece', 'know', 'really', ""n't"", 'saying', 'whole', 'lot', 'considering', 'man', 'resume', 'fact', 'still', 'Tigerland', 'cumulative', 'result', 'directors', 'actors', 'strengths', 'meshing', 'beautifully', 'together']",N/A
530669,A1FH14TQSVDH1X,B00003CXOY,Anthony Sanchez,"[1, 1]","I only picked up this movie because I was interested in a war film.  I don't remember it when it was released a few years ago, but I was very surprised as to the quality of the story.  For me, this is the director's best movie since Falling Down.  Both movies keep the story line and the photography simple, which places the emphasis and burden on good dialogue and character development.Colin Farrell's character, Bozz, reminds me of the Steven McQueen anti-hero from the Sand Pebbles in how he grudgingly accepted that he must see himself in relation to others and forget his own interests.  I appreciate those who argue whether the film's action scenes are realistic or not, but what is real is the need to involve oneself in society.The supporting cast are quite good especially the actor playing Private Johnson.  This film is definitely not to be seen with children in the room or within hearing distance.  It is brutal and the emotions are raw, but I suspect that this is a realistic feeling among those readying themselves to enter a war that is with questionable value for their country.

He seems to either be really good or not good at all.  But he has that star presence and I must admit he is one of my favorites.  Anyone with any doubts as to the acting chops of Colin Farrell must see this movie.  His acting here shows he is among the top in his field and he is capable of anything.  It is an acting tour de force.This film is important on many levels and I think it was very underrated.  It truly deserves a place in film history as one of the best films about war.  And it manages to do this without having any battle scenes or even making it to the war.It takes place in the army training program and shows what all this endures emotionally and physically.  The movie is fully carried on the shoulders of Colin Farrell.  He plays army infantryman private Bozz and has a very strong, rebellious personality while being very intelligent and full of potential at the same time.I don't want to give away more of the plot.  It is a very real, intense emotional movie about the Vietnam War.  The whole ensemble cast is incredible and I have not watched a film that managed to keep me on the edge of my seat, emotionally involved and that also left me with much to think about in a long time.

530674,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00003CXOY,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[3, 4]","For anyone who feels that Colin Farrell is just a pretty face I say watch this movie.  `Tigerland' marks Colin's big break, and this film, this role, should have landed him plenty of meatier roles.  As Private Roland Bozz, a defiant soldier training for Vietnam, Farrell exhibits every sign of a true talent, a true actor and a destined star.  His performance is controlled, relatable and entirely believable.  While watching him move, react and interact with his surroundings and his fellow soldiers you feel connected to him in ways only a masterful actor can make you.  This, my friends, is acting at its finest.`Tigerland' is gritty and raw, thanks in large part to Joel Schumacher's excellent direction, and it's that raw realism that makes for an even more impressive and entertaining ride.  As these men conflict with one another, their emotions whether rage or compassion spilling out like blood from an open wound, the viewer is moved to contemplate their plights and their true character.When Jim Paxton enlists he does so not fully understanding what he's getting himself into.  He longs to write about the war first hand and so to him this is more like a experience.  Roland on the other hand has no interest in being there.  He was drafted and thus hates the very idea of fighting and possibly dying in Vietnam.  The problem though, or not problem but more like irony of it all, is that Bozz is actually quite the gifted soldier.  He's strong, determined and loyal and he has leadership skills that don't go unnoticed by his superiors as well as his fellow peers.  Using these skills to help his friends get discharged instead of honing them to become the soldier they want him to become Bozz is soon faced with a choice, a decision that could very well change his life forever.With exceptional performances by Farrell and Matthew Davis, not to mention Clifton Collins Jr. and Shea Whigham, `Tigerland' serves as more than a brilliant war film, it serves as a catapult for the young talent of today, young actors who are worth so much more than the fluff roles they seem to be getting nowadays.  Here's to hoping that more films like this come along for these young actors so they don't go down as the bunch that could have been great.  It's nice to see Colin finally getting some meaty roles, and Clifton was great in `Capote', but there's so much more talent in these men...it's now Hollywood's job to capitalize on it.",5,A fascinating film littered with young actors with talent coming out of their ears!,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2434,"['anyone', 'who', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'say', 'watch', 'movie', 'Tigerland', 'marks', 'Colin', 'big', 'break', 'film', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'landed', 'plenty', 'meatier', 'roles', 'Private', 'Roland', 'Bozz', 'defiant', 'soldier', 'training', 'Vietnam', 'Farrell', 'sign', 'true', 'talent', 'true', 'actor', 'destined', 'star', 'performance', 'controlled', 'relatable', 'entirely', 'believable', 'watching', 'move', 'react', 'interact', 'surroundings', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'feel', 'connected', 'ways', 'only', 'masterful', 'actor', 'can', 'make', 'friends', 'acting', 'finest.', 'Tigerland', 'gritty', 'raw', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'excellent', 'direction', 'raw', 'realism', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'men', 'conflict', 'one', 'emotions', 'rage', 'compassion', 'spilling', 'out', 'blood', 'open', 'wound', 'viewer', 'moved', 'contemplate', 'plights', 'true', 'character.When', 'Jim', 'Paxton', 'so', 'not', 'fully', 'understanding', 'what', 'getting', 'write', 'war', 'first', 'hand', 'so', 'more', 'experience', 'Roland', 'other', 'hand', 'interest', 'being', 'there', 'was', 'drafted', 'thus', 'very', 'idea', 'fighting', 'possibly', 'dying', 'Vietnam', 'problem', 'not', 'problem', 'more', 'irony', 'Bozz', 'actually', 'quite', 'gifted', 'soldier', 'strong', 'determined', 'loyal', 'leadership', 'skills', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'unnoticed', 'superiors', 'as', 'well', 'fellow', 'peers', 'Using', 'skills', 'help', 'friends', 'get', 'discharged', 'instead', 'honing', 'become', 'soldier', 'want', 'become', 'Bozz', 'soon', 'faced', 'choice', 'decision', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'change', 'life', 'forever.With', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'Farrell', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'not', 'mention', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'Tigerland', 'serves', 'more', 'brilliant', 'war', 'film', 'catapult', 'young', 'talent', 'today', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'fluff', 'roles', 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'nowadays', 'Here', 'hoping', 'more', 'films', 'come', 'young', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'bunch', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'nice', 'see', 'Colin', 'finally', 'getting', 'meaty', 'roles', 'Clifton', 'was', 'great', 'Capote', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'talent', 'men', 'now', 'Hollywood', 'job', 'capitalize']",N/A

530676,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00003CXOY,Doug Park,"[2, 2]","{4.5 stars}TIGERLAND takes place entirely within the confines of Infantry Training at Fort Polk, LA, and its immediate surroundings, 1971. The film does NOT actually go to Vietnam.The whole character of Roland Bozz, memorably played by Colin Farrell, is utterly intriguing. He's a bit overblown: A would-be perfect soldier, perfect leader, perfect shot, in perfect physical and mental condition, a rough, cynical, yet  paradoxically gentle character who just doesn't like armies and war and killing. Nevertheless, I think it would have detracted from the film if Bozz were not a bit larger-than-life. Ditto for the other characters, including the sergeants (both the cruel, sadistic, war-maddened ones and the tough but professional ones) and the other trainees (an interesting and convincing bunch of mixed motivations). While TIGERLAND's plot is quite gripping, it's essentially a character-driven film, and the exemplary acting by just about everyone is what makes it such a success.I've noticed some other reviewers'--some of whom actually trained at Fork Polk during the Vietnam years--objections to TIGERLAND's depiction of the U.S. Army, particularly in regards to its training methods and employment of borderline-psychotic instructors. Duly noted, but it's safe to say that the U.S. military HAS made ample use of such methods/people at various times and places. The film may not be perfectly realistic in every respect; however, it's important to remember that it's set at a time when America, though still anemically hoping to win in Vietnam and still sending unfortunate draftees to same, was also trying to extricate itself from a war whose futility was becoming increasingly obvious. TIGERLAND captures the special malaise of the early '70s war with dead-eyed accuracy.

The only reason I even purchased this movie is because I heard it was really good and it was only $5 at the local Best Buy. Well, I am VERY glad I did make that purchase. Because this is one great movie.Tigerland really isn't a war movie. It's about soldiers dealing with the anticipation of going to war. The story never leaves the U.S. It shows the problems of putting very young men in situations where they may not be ready yet. So unlike most Vietnam war flicks, this doesn't have tons of action in it. It does have more characterization than most, however.The story pretty much revolves around Private Bozz (Colin Farrell). He is a defiant soldier who doesn't respect his superiors. He goes AWOL, mouths off, and basiclly just acts like a 10 yr. old in math class trying to piss off the teacher. But, he does it in a way that isn't annoying or fake. He just doesn't want to go off to war and kill people. He doesn't like the fact that he was drafted, so he is gonna do it his way.I have always liked Colin Farrell, so him being good in this movie didn't surprise me. I can see why Shumacher had so much faith to put him in the lead. This film was made with a bunch of no-name actors (at the time) and he definately stands out. The rest of the cast is very good as well.Going into this film, I didn't know what to expect. I had heard it was a Vietnam war movie and it was very good. I never knew that the story never leaves U.S. soil. After 10 min. into the picture, you won't care. To see how these young soldiers deal with the possibility of going to war and dying for their country in a fight they didn't agree with was great. Some embraced the opporitunity. Some just went along for the ride. And some were like Private Bozz.The thing I like best about this movie is the depth of the characters. You don't get that from most war flicks. This is just a great story mixed with great acting. Joel Schumacher shot this in a gritty & grainy way that almost makes it look like a documentary. No big budget special effects or anything. Just good movie making. It was refreshing after seeing most of the turds he had been putting out several years ago.If you like war movies with more character than bullets, you should check this out. It's got a cast of great young actors and a great story. Colin Farrell is amazing and Schumacher manages to NOT screw this movie up. I highly recommend it. Especially at the budget price I found it for.Special Features: Not a whole lot here. The commentary by Joel Schumacher is actually very good. He is really informative about stuff that is not happening on screen, which is good. I get sick of directors that just basically do a play-by-play of the movie for you. I don't need that. Shumacher does a good job here. The casting sessions with Colin Farrell are nice. The featurette is a bit of fluff, but it's watchable. You also get the trailer. I hope they plan on making a special edition of this movie someday. It definately deserves it.",4,This was a surprise........,1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,3061,"['ruined', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'wanted', 'Joel', 'Shumacher', 'head', 'plate', 'only', 'reason', 'even', 'purchased', 'movie', 'heard', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'was', 'only', '5', 'local', 'Best', 'Buy', 'Well', 'am', 'VERY', 'glad', 'did', 'make', 'purchase', 'one', 'great', 'movie.Tigerland', 'really', ""n't"", 'war', 'movie', 'soldiers', 'dealing', 'anticipation', 'going', 'war', 'story', 'never', 'U.S', 'problems', 'putting', 'very', 'young', 'men', 'situations', 'where', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'ready', 'yet', 'So', 'most', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'flicks', ""n't"", 'have', 'tons', 'action', 'have', 'more', 'characterization', 'most', 'however.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'revolves', 'Private', 'Bozz', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'defiant', 'soldier', 'who', ""n't"", 'respect', 'superiors', 'AWOL', 'mouths', 'off', 'basiclly', 'just', 'acts', '10', 'yr.', 'old', 'math', 'class', 'trying', 'piss', 'off', 'teacher', 'way', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'fake', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'off', 'war', 'kill', 'people', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'was', 'drafted', 'gon', 'na', 'do', 'way.I', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'so', 'being', 'good', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Shumacher', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'faith', 'put', 'lead', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'bunch', 'no-name', 'actors', 'time', 'definately', 'out', 'rest', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'well.Going', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'never', 'knew', 'story', 'never', 'U.S.', 'soil', '10', 'min', 'picture', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'see', 'how', 'young', 'soldiers', 'deal', 'possibility', 'going', 'war', 'dying', 'country', 'fight', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'was', 'great', 'embraced', 'opporitunity', 'just', 'went', 'along', 'ride', 'were', 'like', 'Private', 'Bozz.The', 'thing', 'like', 'best', 'movie', 'depth', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'most', 'war', 'flicks', 'just', 'great', 'story', 'mixed', 'great', 'acting', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'shot', 'gritty', 'grainy', 'way', 'almost', 'look', 'documentary', 'big', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'anything', 'Just', 'good', 'movie', 'making', 'was', 'refreshing', 'seeing', 'most', 'turds', 'had', 'been', 'putting', 'out', 'several', 'years', 'ago.If', 'war', 'movies', 'more', 'character', 'bullets', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'got', 'cast', 'great', 'young', 'actors', 'great', 'story', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'amazing', 'Schumacher', 'manages', 'NOT', 'screw', 'movie', 'up', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Especially', 'budget', 'price', 'found', 'for.Special', 'Features', 'Not', 'whole', 'lot', 'here', 'commentary', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'informative', 'stuff', 'not', 'happening', 'screen', 'good', 'get', 'sick', 'directors', 'just', 'basically', 'do', 'play-by-play', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Shumacher', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'casting', 'sessions', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'are', 'nice', 'featurette', 'bit', 'fluff', 'watchable', 'also', 'get', 'trailer', 'hope', 'plan', 'making', 'special', 'edition', 'movie', 'someday', 'definately']",N/A

This is all fine and dandy.  There is a scene in it where American soldiers, who we are taught are the good guys, are taken into the woods and taught torture techniques involving battery cables being applied to sensitive enemy parts.  That this stuff occurs does not surprise me at all.The movie centers around a soldier in training in the U.S. during the last years of the Vietnam War.  His squad is being trained to be shipped over there, and the odds of dying in this situation are pretty good.  So the army seems to be teaching survival as much as fighting, and we don't blame them.  By now the Army has seen that this war can't be won, and survival is all that is left.The soldier has a bad attitude from start to finish.  The opening scene has him leaving the stockade with the warning that future punishments for insubordination will be worse.  This doesn't deter him.  He constantly berates the system, and keeps getting into more trouble.On the other hand, he has his victories.  At one time, when his C.O. says if he doesn't do something he's going to kill him, the soldier flatly states that no, he's not going to be killed this way.  He does it so convincingly that the C.O., who also knows he's not going to kill him, has to back off.  However, the soldier also does reach out to the C.O. and tries to explain how this is all a game.  In a fairly realistic scene, the C.O. to some degree agrees with him.  These actions of naked truth actually get the soldier to become a squad leader, as he does show many talents.But that's where the problem lies.  I suppose it's OK to say he opposes the Army and war for their own sakes, and leave it at that.  But this obviously talented man doesn't seem to have  a direction of his own.  While he does things to help his fellow soldiers, he also does things that anger them, and I think a flaw of the movie is that he doesn't get his butt kicked from all sides a lot more often.  If the guy had a direction to channel his energy I would have liked the movie better, but with out this I find him just a punk who is endangering people who are just trying to stay alive.",3,"The Army can't figure him out, and neither can I",1048636800,"03 26, 2003",2003,2230,"['OK', 'obvious', 'central', 'character', 'movie', 'movie', 'protest', 'war', 'fine', 'dandy', 'scene', 'where', 'American', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'taught', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'taken', 'woods', 'taught', 'torture', 'techniques', 'involving', 'battery', 'cables', 'being', 'applied', 'sensitive', 'enemy', 'parts', 'stuff', 'not', 'surprise', 'all.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'soldier', 'training', 'U.S.', 'last', 'years', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'squad', 'being', 'trained', 'be', 'shipped', 'there', 'odds', 'dying', 'situation', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'army', 'be', 'teaching', 'survival', 'as', 'much', 'fighting', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'now', 'Army', 'seen', 'war', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'won', 'survival', 'left.The', 'soldier', 'bad', 'attitude', 'start', 'finish', 'opening', 'scene', 'leaving', 'stockade', 'warning', 'future', 'punishments', 'insubordination', 'will', 'be', 'worse', ""n't"", 'deter', 'constantly', 'system', 'getting', 'more', 'other', 'hand', 'victories', 'one', 'time', 'when', 'C.O', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'going', 'kill', 'soldier', 'flatly', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'way', 'so', 'convincingly', 'C.O.', 'who', 'also', 'not', 'going', 'kill', 'back', 'off', 'However', 'soldier', 'also', 'reach', 'C.O', 'explain', 'how', 'game', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'scene', 'C.O', 'degree', 'actions', 'naked', 'truth', 'actually', 'get', 'soldier', 'become', 'squad', 'leader', 'show', 'many', 'talents.But', 'where', 'problem', 'suppose', 'OK', 'say', 'Army', 'war', 'own', 'sakes', 'leave', 'obviously', 'talented', 'man', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'direction', 'own', 'things', 'help', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'also', 'things', 'anger', 'think', 'flaw', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'butt', 'kicked', 'sides', 'lot', 'more', 'often', 'guy', 'had', 'direction', 'channel', 'energy', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'better', 'find', 'just', 'punk', 'who', 'endangering', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive']",N/A

530682,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00003CXOY,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[2, 3]","Tigerland is a Vietnam war film with a difference.  It doesn't have a particular political message regarding Vietnam; it is more of a critique on the culture of warfare in general, where it is difficult to tell the sane from the insane, the true believers from the patriots, and those who simply want to remain alive.At various points in the film, the commanders in charge of training announce to the platoon that has just made another snafu that they are all dead.  'I'm still alive,' the upstart Bozz (played by Colin Farrell in one of his earliest roles) will almost always announce.  At one time, a sergeant tells Bozz that men can't just quit the Army.  'I'm not quitting, I'm just not playing any more,' Bozz calmly announces.The plot revolves around a platoon at training during the early 1970s, when the horrors of the Vietnam war had been played out on television for the greater part of a decade, and no one really wanted to go as a lowly grunt private.  The ultimate in training was Tigerland, a Louisiana swamp area converted into Vietnam-like terrain, for realistic training.  Recruit Bozz is almost like a zen master, taking nothing in the training very seriously other than the potential deadening effects it might have on his (and the others' souls).  Bozz is a troublemaker to the lock-step training mentality; like many troublemakers, he is in fact a diamond-in-the-rough for leadership, as men naturally follow his lead, and he eventually gets rewarded (or so one might think) with responsibility.  However, his primary, self-chosen responsibility seems to be to save people from the Army if they don't warrant being there -- to this end, he helps arrange in ambiguous fashion various types of hardship and disability discharges for others in the platoon, but fails to escape the fate of going to Vietnam himself.Colin Farrell is the only big 'name' in the film, and when it was filmed, he wasn't yet as well known as he is in the post Recruit/SWAT days.  Director Joel Schumacher, known for big-budget blockbusters such as Batman &amp; Robin, filmed this in grainy, shorter film, with no steady cams and harsh cinematography, reflecting the harshness of the training and the unsteady nature of the reality of war.  For a Vietnam war film, this film is unique in that it never actually goes to Vietnam; everything is a home-grown re-creation -- perhaps this is another statement on the reality of war?The roles of Paxton (Matthew Davis) and others recruits in the platoon are played with honesty and integrity; the officers and trainers are bit less realistic at times it seems, but then such officials must needs put on a persona when in such roles, so perhaps this is reflected in the actors' performances as actors in a very different engagement.The DVD has a few extras, including Colin Farrell's screen test.  A fascinating film, enigmatic in its ending and the overall meaning, save to say that perhaps all of war, and most of life generally, is absurd.",5,"Tiger, tiger, burning bright...",1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,2978,"['Tigerland', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'film', 'difference', ""n't"", 'have', 'particular', 'political', 'message', 'regarding', 'Vietnam', 'more', 'critique', 'culture', 'warfare', 'general', 'where', 'difficult', 'tell', 'sane', 'insane', 'true', 'believers', 'patriots', 'who', 'simply', 'want', 'remain', 'alive.At', 'various', 'points', 'film', 'commanders', 'charge', 'training', 'announce', 'platoon', 'just', 'made', 'snafu', 'are', 'dead', ""'m"", 'still', 'alive', 'upstart', 'Bozz', 'played', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'one', 'earliest', 'roles', 'will', 'almost', 'always', 'announce', 'one', 'time', 'sergeant', 'tells', 'Bozz', 'men', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'quit', 'Army', ""'m"", 'not', 'quitting', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'playing', 'more', 'Bozz', 'calmly', 'announces.The', 'plot', 'revolves', 'platoon', 'training', 'early', '1970s', 'when', 'horrors', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'had', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'television', 'greater', 'part', 'decade', 'one', 'really', 'wanted', 'go', 'lowly', 'grunt', 'private', 'ultimate', 'training', 'was', 'Tigerland', 'Louisiana', 'swamp', 'area', 'converted', 'Vietnam-like', 'terrain', 'realistic', 'training', 'Recruit', 'Bozz', 'almost', 'zen', 'master', 'taking', 'nothing', 'training', 'very', 'seriously', 'other', 'potential', 'deadening', 'effects', 'might', 'have', 'others', 'souls', 'Bozz', 'troublemaker', 'lock-step', 'training', 'mentality', 'many', 'troublemakers', 'fact', 'diamond-in-the-rough', 'leadership', 'men', 'naturally', 'follow', 'lead', 'eventually', 'rewarded', 'so', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'responsibility', 'However', 'primary', 'self-chosen', 'responsibility', 'be', 'save', 'people', 'Army', 'do', ""n't"", 'warrant', 'being', 'there', 'end', 'arrange', 'ambiguous', 'fashion', 'various', 'types', 'hardship', 'disability', 'discharges', 'others', 'platoon', 'escape', 'fate', 'going', 'Vietnam', 'himself.Colin', 'Farrell', 'only', 'big', ""'name"", 'film', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', ""n't"", 'yet', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'post', 'Recruit/SWAT', 'days', 'Director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'known', 'big-budget', 'blockbusters', 'such', 'Batman', 'amp', 'Robin', 'filmed', 'grainy', 'shorter', 'film', 'steady', 'cams', 'harsh', 'cinematography', 'reflecting', 'harshness', 'training', 'unsteady', 'nature', 'reality', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'film', 'film', 'unique', 'never', 'actually', 'Vietnam', 'everything', 'home-grown', 're-creation', 'perhaps', 'statement', 'reality', 'war', 'roles', 'Paxton', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'others', 'recruits', 'platoon', 'are', 'played', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'officers', 'trainers', 'are', 'bit', 'less', 'realistic', 'times', 'then', 'such', 'officials', 'must', 'needs', 'put', 'persona', 'when', 'such', 'roles', 'so', 'perhaps', 'reflected', 'actors', 'performances', 'actors', 'very', 'different', 'engagement.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'including', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'screen', 'test', 'fascinating', 'film', 'enigmatic', 'ending', 'overall', 'meaning', 'save', 'say', 'perhaps', 'war', 'most', 'life', 'generally', 'absurd']",N/A

As a matter of fact, Joel Schumaker proves it doesnt even take Vietnam to make a gripping Vietnam movie.  All you need is a moving tale and a flawless performance from your lead actor. Tigerland has both.Colin Farrell is Bozz, a renegade private in training before he sets out for the battlefields of Vietnam.  His flamboyance and disrespect has him hated by those who would train him and awed by those that would serve with him.  His character proves to be more than a rebel. Through a brilliant job of acting Farrell shows Bozz to be scared, anxious, compassionate, and intelligent.  The setting of the story revolves around army infantry training that culminates in a mock Vietnam setting called Tigerland.  Throughout the movie we are exposed to the emotion of those that fear Vietnam and would do almost anything not to go, and the lunacy of those that welcome the carnage with open arms.  The film has many moving moments and the good guy vs. bad guy sub plot that we all love.  (The bad guy being a Private Wilson - another fine bit of acting)Tigerland is full of great imagery and even shot with a grainy texture that gives it a documentary sort of feel.

Instead of relying in trite action scenes and countless shoot outs, it tries to present a different approach and offers an intriguing character study worth watching.Colin Farrell (in one of his best roles) plays Bozz, the anti-hero tough soldier that tries to resist against the imploding madness that surrounds him, as he sees the war coming closer.Although we never get to watch proper war scenes, we get a glimpse at the life of american soldiers in a training camp whose function is to get them prepared for the upcoming events. This is an interesting approach, and director Joel Schumacher (&quot;Phone Booth&quot;, &quot;Falling Down&quot;, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;) knows how to develop a peculiar vision and scope, presenting a well-crafted drama and a tense atmosphere.The directing options are adequate, like the gritty and realistic photography and the Dogma-movement style techniques. This makes for a credible and convincing mood, delivering a powerful and suspenseful sense of danger.In a way, Bozz is already fighting in a war against the system before he enters the Vietnam. It`s remarkable to notice that these soldiers are complex, flawed and ambiguous, far from the innocent, good-hearted and bland charicatures that are presented in so many Hollywood war flicks (&quot;Pearl Harbour&quot;, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;, anyone?). The movie also avoids predictable melodramatic fluff, going for a subtle, moving and somber perspective and approaching a wider range of depth and emotion.&quot;Tigerland&quot; is surely one of the best Schumacher`s films, a relevant and compelling effort about choice, friendship, trust, ideals and power.A thought-provoking and meaningful cinematic experience.",4,"Gritty, Real, Poignant, Innovative",1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,1873,"['As', 'far', 'war', 'movies', 'go', 'quot', 'Tigerland', 'quot', 'certainly', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'ones', 'last', 'years', 'Instead', 'relying', 'trite', 'action', 'scenes', 'countless', 'shoot', 'outs', 'present', 'different', 'approach', 'intriguing', 'character', 'study', 'worth', 'watching.Colin', 'Farrell', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'Bozz', 'anti-hero', 'tough', 'soldier', 'resist', 'imploding', 'madness', 'war', 'coming', 'never', 'get', 'watch', 'proper', 'war', 'scenes', 'get', 'glimpse', 'life', 'american', 'soldiers', 'training', 'camp', 'function', 'get', 'prepared', 'upcoming', 'events', 'interesting', 'approach', 'director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'quot', 'Falling', 'Down', 'quot', 'quot', 'Batman', 'amp', 'Robin', 'quot', 'how', 'develop', 'peculiar', 'vision', 'scope', 'presenting', 'well-crafted', 'drama', 'tense', 'atmosphere.The', 'directing', 'options', 'are', 'adequate', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'photography', 'Dogma-movement', 'style', 'techniques', 'credible', 'convincing', 'mood', 'delivering', 'powerful', 'suspenseful', 'sense', 'danger.In', 'way', 'Bozz', 'already', 'fighting', 'war', 'system', 'Vietnam', 's', 'remarkable', 'notice', 'soldiers', 'are', 'complex', 'flawed', 'ambiguous', 'far', 'innocent', 'good-hearted', 'bland', 'charicatures', 'are', 'presented', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'war', 'flicks', 'quot', 'Pearl', 'Harbour', 'quot', 'quot', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'quot', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'quot', 'anyone', 'movie', 'also', 'predictable', 'melodramatic', 'fluff', 'going', 'subtle', 'moving', 'somber', 'perspective', 'approaching', 'wider', 'range', 'depth', 'emotion.', 'quot', 'Tigerland', 'quot', 'surely', 'one', 'best', 'Schumacher', 's', 'films', 'relevant', 'compelling', 'effort', 'choice', 'friendship', 'trust', 'ideals', 'power.A', 'thought-provoking', 'meaningful', 'cinematic', 'experience']",N/A
530685,A3DUFMYW4GZK34,B00003CXOY,Greg White,"[14, 17]","This film probably deserves 4.5 stars, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt on account of Colin Farrel's portrayel of Bozz.I'll start of by saying this:  If you liked Joel Schumacher's other films, chances are, your not gonna be a great big fan of this one.  It's shot entirely in 16mm which gives it the feel of a documentary.  I must say, generally, I'm not a fan of anything NOT 35mm, but if this were shot any other way, I don't think I just would have gotten the full affect of it.  I'm also very impressed that Schumacher decided to go with this than any other mainstream film like &quot;8MM&quot; which, no offense to Mr. Schumacher, well, sucked.The film's main character is Bozz, portrayed by Colin Farrel, wonderfully.  Bozz is a badass who was drafted and doesn't believe in war.  His commanding officers tell him time and again that he could be on of the best soldiers if he chose to, but he just doesn't agree with putting another human being through that kind of punishment.  One scene that really got to me was when a sergeant is teaching the &quot;soldiers&quot; how to get information from &quot;Charlies&quot;.  They attach two wires to the man's testicles and let 'er rip.  This was one of the, if not the, best acting in the entire movie.  Just the way Farrel talks, and his facial expressions are enough to make you stand and clap.I wanted to comment on Colin Farrel's excellent acting, and I'm sure you've read about the plot numerous times already, so I'm going to discuss the features of the DVD.  We'll start off with, to me, the most attractive feature added, Colin Farrel's screen tests.  In these, you can hear a little bit of his Irish accent, and the video is quite poor.  On the other hand, it's a good insight on what he had to get through, and how much more his acting had evolved.  His acting is superb is the screen tests, but just not as good as in the movie itself.  I'm usually more attracted to a director's work than an actor's, but there was just so much said about Farrel that I couldn't not buy this DVD.  The transfer is also decent, and if you buy this, know that it's not supposed to be squeaky clean, and without grain and chroma noise.  The havoc of 16mm really added a lot to the film itself, almost as if the video had an uncredited starring role.  Also on this DVD is an audio commentary from the director which is pretty good.  Another thing that would have been awesome on this DVD is a commentary with the stars, mainly Farrel.  There's also a making of &quot;fearurette&quot;.  Key word here is &quot;Featurette&quot; just not enough there to satisfy me.  The DVD is finished off with trailers and TV spots, and an unafvertised trailor for the upcoming &quot;TORA! TORA! TORA!&quot; special edition DVD.The DVD isn't flawless, but if your a war fan, or just looking for a look at one of the upcoming stars in the industry, this is the way to go.  The DVD is well-rounded and the screen tests were definitely worth it.  The film is worth a look regardless or whether or not you buy the DVD.  You've absolutely got to see this movie, but the DVD is the way to go because you get a look into the process of the movie coming together.  This one's definitely deserves to be up on the shelves with all the other great war movies.",5,Damn Good War Movie,988243200,"04 26, 2001",2001,3284,"['film', 'probably', '4.5', 'stars', ""'m"", 'giving', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'account', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'portrayel', 'Bozz.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'liked', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'other', 'films', 'chances', 'are', 'not', 'gon', 'be', 'great', 'big', 'fan', 'one', 'shot', 'entirely', '16mm', 'feel', 'documentary', 'must', 'say', 'generally', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'anything', 'NOT', '35mm', 'were', 'shot', 'other', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'full', 'affect', ""'m"", 'also', 'very', 'impressed', 'Schumacher', 'decided', 'go', 'other', 'mainstream', 'film', 'quot', '8MM', 'quot', 'offense', 'Mr.', 'Schumacher', 'well', 'sucked.The', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Bozz', 'portrayed', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'wonderfully', 'Bozz', 'badass', 'who', 'was', 'drafted', ""n't"", 'believe', 'war', 'commanding', 'officers', 'tell', 'time', 'again', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'soldiers', 'chose', 'just', ""n't"", 'agree', 'putting', 'human', 'being', 'kind', 'punishment', 'One', 'scene', 'really', 'got', 'was', 'when', 'sergeant', 'teaching', 'quot', 'soldiers', 'quot', 'how', 'get', 'information', 'quot', 'Charlies', 'quot', 'attach', 'two', 'wires', 'man', 'testicles', 'let', ""'er"", 'rip', 'was', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'acting', 'entire', 'movie', 'Just', 'way', 'Farrel', 'talks', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'stand', 'clap.I', 'wanted', 'comment', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'excellent', 'acting', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'read', 'plot', 'numerous', 'times', 'already', ""'m"", 'going', 'discuss', 'features', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'most', 'attractive', 'feature', 'added', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'screen', 'tests', 'can', 'hear', 'little', 'bit', 'Irish', 'accent', 'video', 'quite', 'poor', 'other', 'hand', 'good', 'insight', 'what', 'had', 'get', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'acting', 'had', 'evolved', 'acting', 'superb', 'screen', 'tests', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'movie', ""'m"", 'usually', 'more', 'attracted', 'director', 'work', 'actor', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'said', 'Farrel', 'could', ""n't"", 'not', 'buy', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'also', 'decent', 'buy', 'know', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'grain', 'chroma', 'noise', 'havoc', '16mm', 'really', 'added', 'lot', 'film', 'almost', 'video', 'had', 'uncredited', 'starring', 'role', 'Also', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'pretty', 'good', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'awesome', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'stars', 'mainly', 'Farrel', 'also', 'making', 'quot', 'fearurette', 'quot', 'Key', 'word', 'here', 'quot', 'Featurette', 'quot', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'there', 'satisfy', 'DVD', 'finished', 'off', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots', 'unafvertised', 'trailor', 'upcoming', 'quot', 'TORA', 'TORA', 'TORA', 'quot', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'flawless', 'war', 'fan', 'just', 'looking', 'look', 'one', 'upcoming', 'stars', 'industry', 'way', 'go', 'DVD', 'well-rounded', 'screen', 'tests', 'were', 'definitely', 'worth', 'film', 'look', 'regardless', 'not', 'buy', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'absolutely', 'got', 'see', 'movie', 'DVD', 'way', 'go', 'get', 'look', 'process', 'movie', 'coming', 'together', 'one', 'definitely', 'be', 'up', 'shelves', 'other', 'great', 'war', 'movies']",N/A

It concentrates on the training marines got in the early 1970s when everything was already lost and the US tried to find a way out without knowing how. One more film about marine-training, will you say, and wrong you will be again because there is a rub somewhere. One of the new marines is just the very type that rebels against any authority, any hierarchy. His presence changes everything. It is very hard for him and for the other men up to the moment when he is entrusted with the commanding position in his unit. An officer felt that he had the power to be in command, though he was rebellious because he was afraid of it. And this captain was right. He creates a rather relaxed atmosphere and he is able to feel the value of his men, those who will be able to go through the war, to be a real help to the others, and those who would be a danger to everyone. He manages the weak ones and the dangerous ones so that they get out before going to Vietnam. And he finally goes with his men and disappears with them, so says the film. This film is about military training. It takes more than authority to train men for battle. It takes guts and humanity, even if at times it also takes some decision-making and some violence. But altogether it is a shame to sacrifice such men in a war when they could have been brilliant assets for the country and its development instead of a war that has no chance whatsoever to be won. We should meditate this simple truth over and over again. Human values are so much more human when they take part in a constructive human project, and war is never, absolutely never, a constructive project.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit?

530688,A39VJRIW7HC5C0,B00003CXOY,James Kunz,"[2, 4]","Though by the time the film was made in 2000 the Vietnam War had been history for well over two decades, Tigerland takes a different approach to the controversial conflict and thus not only avoids a ""been-there/done-that"" feel, but emerges as an astounding film.  Much has been made of Colin Ferrell's performance, and while it is by all accounnts tremendous, especially in light of the fact that his character is the crux of the film, I fear a very good movie has been lost in the accolades for Ferrell.The movie takes place in 1971 when public opinion for the Vietnam War was very negative.  Nonetheless, the war must still be fought and troops must still be trained.  Into this situation comes Roland Bozz, fresh out of the stockade and headed for Fort Polk training camp and then Tigerland, ""the stateside province of Vietnam.""  Bozz, the type of man who would carry Johnny Got His Gun on a troop truck merely to enrage patriotists, feels that neither he nor any of the men belongs in a war.  He is constantly disobediant, rabble-rousing, and troublemaking.  He uses loopholes to get some of the GIs out of training and back home, and soon becomes a leader and to some  degree a hero, in the spirit of Randle McMurphy's character in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Although subplots concerning Bozz's relationship with a hostile soldier and his hesitant friendship with Private Paxton (Matthew Davis) are handled well, it is Bozz's non-conformity and fight against the army that make up the heart of the movie.  This is a good thing, for those scenes are very well done and keep the viewer locked-in.  While the movie never touches Vietnam, it is a superlative war movie and does not (as others have claimed) model itself after Full Metal Jacket.

The use of 16mm film could have added power if there had just been something of a story to be told.Instead we are introduced to the caring Bos, but we are never given any clues to why he cares, who he is, or what he actually thinks about anything. It's just one stereotype after another. We have it all in this film, the sadistic DI, the psycho recruit, the uncaring leader trying to fill a quota, and the savvy mentor fresh from the carnage. It is not only an insult to those who served, it insults the intelligence of any poor soul unfortunate enough to have rented it.

530696,A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ,B00003CXOY,Larry Scantlebury,"[6, 6]","Actually, this Joel Schumacher film is fairly good with good acting and kind of a ""Blow"" or ""Man on Fire"" cinematography. I gave it 3 stars but I can yield to an argument that it could be more. The problem is what follows.It's just hard to believe. It never captured me. The Army has it's Advanced Infantry Training (AIT) and the Marine Corps has its ITR, Infantry Training Regiment. The Corps also has a brutal 26 week course for Officers called The Basic School, carrying with it the peculiar initials TBS. Quantico has the 'Hill Trail' and no one EVER forgets the pain, agony, and frequently, unconsciousness of trekking its hills, gulleys, ravines and streams. But all those things are founded on a principle . . . oh, about 6000 years old, that what you practice over and over again when no one is slinging spears, arrows, rocks or firing Russian mortars at you, you'll be able to do when they are. (Check out Spielberg's quintessential combat sequence in the first thirty minutes of Private Ryan.)All countries do it and have done it for 60 or 70 centuries. You want to see training camps? Check out ""The Washing of the Spears"" about Isalwanda and Roarke's Drift and learn about the Zulus, who could run 40 miles, fight a pitched battle, and run home, all in a day.So Vietnam, or what Vietnam has become in the memory of those who never were there, is no different and the training was no different. To those who say 'yeah and we lost that war,' fair point. But we had a long string of victories up to that.Which brings up the concept of war. Tennyson writes about his son who died at the Somme, ""when they ask you why they died, tell them because their fathers lied."" So there's no argument there. But for those aforementioned 60 or 70 centuries, we don't seem to have found an alternative. This doesn't mean we want it. It only means, we seem to keep on doing it.We have two people in the last century who did something different. Passive resistance. Ghandi and John Paul. They accomplished extraordinary success through non-war, and it's difficult to argue that maybe British Colonialism would have collapsed anyhow (possibly) and maybe the Russian Communists would have drank themselves to death eventually (also a not remote possibility). But they didn't. Still, not many guys or movements to write about in the last 150 years. Perhaps Dr. King as well if you include our dismal Civil Rights history here in the USA. But again, three's not a lot.Here, in Tigerland, there's too many troops who talk about calculus, emotional thalidomide and Camus when they're smoking a joint. Doesn't happen. The day's too long. You're beat. You sleep. And there's certainly never in the history of combat training, a private sitting in the quarters of the Commanding Officer, talking about the unfairness of war.Finally, psychos in the Army. Sure. A couple slip through. Hey. You're about to do something that Ministers, Rabbis, schoolteachers and parents have raised you not to do. A little emotional stress and dysfunction is to be expected. Don't forget fear. It's damn scary. But the snake eyed crazo just doesn't exist. He doesn't slip through. Makes a great story if you're doing Freddy and Jason movies. But not very realistic.So that's my problem. I just couldn't get behind it. Too much required suspension of disbelief. My favorites of that genre still remain Deerhunter and Platoon, with Full Metal a close third.Farrell does a very good job. You can see he's headed for more centerpiece rolls. And Schumacher's a great director. 3 stars.

530697,A3K5IMGDCDBCNF,B00003CXOY,"""lecorel@hotmail.com""","[27, 30]","After I watched this movie I really thought about why it was so good.  The conclusion I arrived at was that it put a very original twist on a very documented subject; the Vietnam War.The film focases on a group of young men in infantry training for combat.  Quickly the film introduces it's central character, a rebelious private named Bozz(Coilin Ferrell).  Bozz was drafted and does not believe in the army and he will do whatever it takes convey that point except desert.  At first nobody likes him because he causes problems for everyone in his platoon.  In particular the drill sargents and another private named Wilson(Shea Whigham) despise Bozz.  However the rest of the men really start to warm to Bozz and his cause.  He makes frinds with Paxton(Matthew Davis) and helps out some other soldiers which gains him favor among the others.  Eventually Bozz becomes the leader of the platoon just before thay are sent to Tigerland, which is the name the army has given their mock Vietnam.Tigerland is different from most war movies in that the soldiers in this film are never shown going to war.  Instead the film is all about the training of the soldiers before they actually were sent to fight and the effects it had on them.  Essentially not a whole lot happens in this film event wise, but the character study of the young men faced with war is masterful.  The performances from the whole cast are excellent.  Collin Ferrell is quite exceptional as Bozz.  He is clever, funny, objectional, loyal and troubled, which gives the character a lot of depth.  Matthew Davis, Clifton Collin Jr, and Shea Whigham all turn in wonderful supporting roles as well.  Director Joel Schumacher(The Lost Boys, The client, 8mm) has crafted a beautiful film.  His direction is quiet and subtle.  His use of hand held cameras with 16mm film gives the movie a unique, documentary feel.While I was watching this film I had a interesting revilation about it's message.  The film actually points out that the men who fought in Vietnam came from different backrounds and had very different opinions about what they were doing there.  To many, honor and duty were arbitrary when it came to the war because, like Bozz, it had nothing to do with them.  For others it was all that mattered, and for still more they were just there.  But for all of them the fear and reality of war was present.  Additionally I really got the feeling these men had no idea what they were even preparing for.  I would be willing to wager just from watching movies on the Vietnam war such as Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and Apocalypse Now, that I have a greater understanding of what was happening in Vietnam at the time than these young men did before they were sent.  They were trained to fight a enemy they had never seen, half way around the world, and all they really knew was that people were dying.  So how could they really be prepared.I urge people to see this film.  It was very well done and worth the time.  I am surprised it did not have a wider release in the theatres.  It was one of the better films of 2000 and a worthy addition to the chronicles of war pictures.

His performance is gripping, but not masterful.  We don't totally comprehend the cause for his actions.  He seems split between irresponsibility and caring for his friends.  The sex scene where writer buddy Matthew Davis as Paxton and Bozz bond while sharing a room with two girls from a bar sets the course as a buddy movie.  Shea Wigham as the violent Wilson who holds a grudge makes an impression.  Cole Hauser who is son of actor Wings Hauser also makes an impression as the obnoxious Sergeant Cota who enjoys rubbing the soldiers noses in the dirt as he sends them off to likely be killed in Vietnam.  The film seems to meander a bit with the supporting roles tending to blur rather than be real distinct.  The strength of the film is to explore the conflict of getting soldiers ready while the anti-war sentiments take a toll on the morale.

Based on the personal experiences of one of the writers, Ross Kavan, and cast with fresh-faced unknowns, the story takes place in 1971 when a group of recruits go through Advanced Infantry Training at Fort Polk, Louisiana's infamous Tigerland, the last stop before Vietnam for tens of thousands of young men at the time.One of the recruits, Roland Bozz, is rebellious and willful and refuses to accept authority.  He wants to get out of going to Vietnam, but instead finds himself helping other draftees to find legal loopholes and becomes a sort of savior figure to the men.  He's a natural leader and even commands respect from his superiors.  Somehow, though, he seems too good to be true.  We get a different view of the war through this boot camp experience, and sense the horror even though it is all just war games and physical conditioning.In spite of the action, I found myself bored.  And the lead character, Colin Farrel, just didn't seem to ring true.  We never hear one bit about his background, and he seems just too much wiser than any of the other men. Even though he had no accent, I understand he's an Irish actor and its possible that this is what kept him from acting like what I think of as an American G.I.

Instead of telling us about the war in Vietnam, it tells us the story of the path to get there. The results are absolutely excellent. Colin Farrell gives a star-making performance as Bozz, a rebellious recruit who hates the war, but has fun with it anyway. He's also an expert on military loopholes. At one point, he's stopped by a very young man who says, ""They say there are two ways to avoid Vietnam: pray to Jesus or talk to Bozz."" He couldn't be more correct. Bozz quickly learns respect among his platoon, despite the officers' constant hate and picking on of him. Soon, the platoon moves on to Tigerland, a shoddy war simulation of 'Nam where Bozz must prove his worthiness as platoon leader. Director Joel Schumacher proves here that he can still direct an excellent movie. His style is frantic and grainy, kind of like an old war movie. I suspect that's what he was going for. Farrell's performance is unforgettable. He's reminiscent of Brad Pitt in a few scenes, but mostly manages to create his own image. This movie proves that there is a likelihood he'll be getting an Oscar sometime in his career. He's definitely worthy of it. I reccommend ""Tigerland"" to pretty much anybody.

Who the hell thought Joel Schumacher, who has made some incredibly bad movies (""Batman & Robin"" for one) was capable of something so....well, not Hollywood? No famous actors. No budget to speak of. Everything shot in sixteen millimeter for the shaky-camera effect. And of course a dialogue-driven story. If you've read the other reviews you know the plot particulars, so I'll skip them and just say this: although this is not a ""war"" movie in the classic sense (it's about the final training grunts receive before they ship off to Vietnam), the environment is every bit as ruthless as combat. The grunts are beaten and belittled like field hands by sergeants whose approaches run from ""tough love"" to ""outright sadism."" Forget the stylized brutality you saw in ""Full Metal Jacket."" ""Tigerland"" has no style, no grace, no senstivity -- it's just an ugly, nasty documentary-style movie that shows how military training affects different types of human beings: some break, some twist, and some grow stronger under pressure. And unlike many classic war movies which show the US Army as a melting pot of all classes, ""Tigerland"" demonstrates that drafted war is almost exclusively the province of poor, dumb, scared kids from ghettos and trailer parks who have no stake in either victory or defeat. The movie has a few minor weaknessess -- Collin Farrell's Bozz is so resiliently insubordinate there are times you kind of want to see him get broken, the only patriotic soldiers in the squad are presented simultaneously as viciously paranoid, homophobic racists (it's not hard to see where the producers' politics lie) and the ending wanders a bit far into predictable territory. Still, overall, this is a very gripping movie, and it shows that deep down, even the most explotive, bought-and-paid-for Hollywood schlockmeisters probably have the talent to make great entertainment....if only Hollywood would let them.",4,Ouch.,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,1971,"['brutally', 'efficient', 'piece', 'no-frills', 'filmmaking', 'Who', 'hell', 'thought', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'who', 'made', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'movies', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'one', 'was', 'capable', 'something', 'so', '.well', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'famous', 'actors', 'budget', 'speak', 'Everything', 'shot', 'sixteen', 'millimeter', 'shaky-camera', 'effect', 'course', 'dialogue-driven', 'story', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'know', 'plot', 'particulars', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'just', 'say', 'not', 'war', 'movie', 'classic', 'sense', 'final', 'training', 'grunts', 'receive', 'ship', 'Vietnam', 'environment', 'bit', 'as', 'ruthless', 'combat', 'grunts', 'are', 'beaten', 'belittled', 'field', 'hands', 'sergeants', 'approaches', 'run', 'tough', 'love', 'outright', 'sadism', 'stylized', 'brutality', 'saw', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Tigerland', 'style', 'grace', 'senstivity', 'just', 'ugly', 'nasty', 'documentary-style', 'movie', 'how', 'military', 'training', 'affects', 'different', 'types', 'human', 'beings', 'break', 'twist', 'grow', 'stronger', 'pressure', 'many', 'classic', 'war', 'movies', 'show', 'US', 'Army', 'melting', 'pot', 'classes', 'Tigerland', 'drafted', 'war', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'province', 'poor', 'dumb', 'scared', 'kids', 'ghettos', 'trailer', 'parks', 'who', 'have', 'stake', 'victory', 'defeat', 'movie', 'few', 'minor', 'weaknessess', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'Bozz', 'so', 'resiliently', 'insubordinate', 'are', 'times', 'kind', 'want', 'see', 'get', 'broken', 'only', 'patriotic', 'soldiers', 'squad', 'are', 'presented', 'simultaneously', 'viciously', 'paranoid', 'homophobic', 'racists', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'where', 'producers', 'politics', 'lie', 'ending', 'wanders', 'bit', 'far', 'predictable', 'territory', 'Still', 'overall', 'very', 'gripping', 'movie', 'deep', 'down', 'even', 'most', 'explotive', 'bought-and-paid-for', 'Hollywood', 'schlockmeisters', 'probably', 'have', 'talent', 'make', 'great', 'entertainment', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'let']",N/A

Joel Schumacher nailed the hide to the wall three times early in his career, in St. Elmo&#146;s Fire (1985), The Lost Boys (1987), and Flatliners (1990) (we&#146;ll overlook the overly sappy Cousins, a remake of a much finer French film, in the middle there). Then came Dying Young, and the end of Joel Schumacher&#146;s career as a credible filmmaker. Did I learn after two Batman flops, two John Grisham adaptations, and the horrors that were Falling Down and 8MM? Nope. I still felt the need to rent Tigerland, mostly because many people considered it one of the finest films of 2000 and one of the most realistic war movies ever made. This despite that fact that, well, it isn&#146;t really about the Vietnam War.Tigerland is a training camp in the American south to which many soldiers headed off to the Vietnam War were sent before shipping out. It was created to give the new recruits a taste of what Vietnam would really be like. The film was shot on location, so you can&#146;t fault his veracity there.The movie centers on Private Bozz (Colin Farrell, in his third war movie in three years), a guy who seems like he would have been a conscientious objector had he known the open was open to him. To each side, Bozz has an archetype&#151;his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis, recently seen in Blue Crush) and his worst enemy, Wilson (Shea Wigham). The story, what there is of it, follows the three of them as they go through training. Despite our having seen such things work in films like Full Metal Jacket, the pacing of this movie comes off a little too slow for the subject matter. This is not helped by the characters, who are shallow to the extreme, flesh renditions of single emotions put there to advance a viewpoint. While the script does manage a fine ironic ending, what builds up to it certainly wasn&#146;t one of the finest films of 2000, nor the finest war movie of the last decade, as some have claimed. **",2,"Needed help, and badly.",1036800000,"11 9, 2002",2002,2006,"['Tigerland', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', '2000', 'know', 'still', 'haven', '146', 't', 'learned', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'nailed', 'hide', 'wall', 'three', 'times', 'early', 'career', 'St.', 'Elmo', '146', 's', 'Fire', '1985', 'Lost', 'Boys', '1987', 'Flatliners', '1990', '146', 'overlook', 'overly', 'sappy', 'Cousins', 'remake', 'much', 'finer', 'French', 'film', 'middle', 'there', 'Then', 'came', 'Dying', 'Young', 'end', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', '146', 's', 'career', 'credible', 'filmmaker', 'Did', 'learn', 'two', 'Batman', 'flops', 'two', 'John', 'Grisham', 'adaptations', 'horrors', 'were', 'Falling', 'Down', '8MM', 'Nope', 'still', 'felt', 'need', 'rent', 'Tigerland', 'mostly', 'many', 'people', 'considered', 'one', 'finest', 'films', '2000', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'war', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'fact', 'well', '146', 't', 'really', 'Vietnam', 'War.Tigerland', 'training', 'camp', 'American', 'south', 'many', 'soldiers', 'headed', 'off', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'were', 'sent', 'shipping', 'out', 'was', 'created', 'give', 'new', 'recruits', 'taste', 'what', 'Vietnam', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'can', '146', 't', 'fault', 'veracity', 'there.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'Private', 'Bozz', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'third', 'war', 'movie', 'three', 'years', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'had', 'known', 'open', 'was', 'open', 'side', 'Bozz', 'archetype', '151', 'best', 'friend', 'Paxton', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'recently', 'seen', 'Blue', 'Crush', 'worst', 'enemy', 'Wilson', 'Shea', 'Wigham', 'story', 'what', 'three', 'go', 'training', 'having', 'seen', 'such', 'things', 'work', 'films', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'pacing', 'movie', 'off', 'little', 'too', 'slow', 'subject', 'matter', 'not', 'helped', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'shallow', 'extreme', 'flesh', 'renditions', 'single', 'emotions', 'put', 'there', 'advance', 'viewpoint', 'script', 'manage', 'fine', 'ironic', 'ending', 'what', 'up', 'certainly', '146', 'one', 'finest', 'films', '2000', 'finest', 'war', 'movie', 'last', 'decade', 'have', 'claimed', '**']",N/A

But psychological material demands a great screenplay, and Ross Klavan and Michael McGruther don't give us one. We never learn who Bozz is, what he really stands for, and what experiences might have driven him to do the things he does. Colin Farrell's knockout performance makes it perfectly clear that something interesting is going on in Bozz's head, and I was waiting for the scene when we'd find out just what. Of course, Bozz is not the kind of character who would ever open up to his buddies, so it would be unrealistic for him to just spill his guts. Flashbacks could have been used, or the actual reappearance of a character from his past - or even just some really subtle dialogue. But Klavan and McGruther seem to have decided that every second word should begin with 'f' (perhaps trying to capture the situation's brutality), or else be unreasonably eloquent. In any case, instead of exploring the psychological territory the story stakes out for itself, it quickly collapses into cliche and mawkishness, then limps to an anticlimax that never really pays off. Schumacher tries for gritty realism with the hand-held camera, 16mm, and documentary style. But ironically, for this kind of cerebral story they're entirely the wrong choices - and in Schumacher's fumbling hands it just plays like a studio movie anyway. Still, this was a great effort from Colin Farrell, despite his Texan drawl occasionally straying back to Dublin. He owns the screen whenever he's on it, even in small roles (as in ""Minority Report""). He has the talent and the looks to play hero or villain or anything in between.

Johnson Jr.,"[0, 0]","Don't get me wrong, this film is by no means the best war movie, or even best Vietnam film made; but it is, however, the best role a war has ever had to play on film. Explanation: We never actually see the jungle terrain of Vietnam in Tigerland, instead we witness bootcamp circa Vietnam through the eyes of Private Jim Paxton (Matthew Davis), a noble and romantic wannabe Hemmingway who believes that the war will provide him some insight into humanity. While he may not necessarily be wrong to that extent, he is wrong in his assumption of what the war or even the modern soldier are. Setting him straight in this regard is the wonderful character of Private Bozz (an excellent performance by Collin Farrell), who has an utter disregard for authority and the war, and desperately wants to escape both of their clutches.It would have been easy to concentrate on the terrific Bozz character who is part Bill Murray from ""Stripes"" and part Cool Hand Luke (as previously, and accurately stated), but the supporting cast was surprisingly fleshed out as well, from the excellent Paxton to the incapable and frightened Miter, all the way down to the mean-spirited antagonist Wilson. The cliche's are avoided in this film.Throughout the entire film, Vietnam plays an important role, creating a ""High Noon"" like climactic experience. Every day that passes for the soldiers, and every day that we get to know, undertstand, and love them more, is a day closer to the jaws of Vietnam. The war works better as a looming menace than it has worked as an actual setting in past films.While the standout in this film is Farrell for his breakout performance as Bozz, the rest of the excellent young cast deserves applause as well for not falling into the old routine of poor, dumb, scared soldiers, even though many of them are. But the bulk of praise should be heaped on the capable and talented young shoulders of cinematographer Matthew Libatique, whose work was superior to the similar, oscar winning effort of ""Traffic"". Not to mention Schumacher, who after the wretched tragedy of ""Batman and Robin"" has returned to his roots as a filmaker, and made a terrific film in the process.

530732,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00003CXOY,Westley,"[6, 6]","The director of Tigerland, Joel Schumacher, is best known for big budget action hokum, such as The Lost Boys, Flatliners, and Batman and Robin.  Tigerland is the antithesis of these movies.  It is not slick, opting for a docudrama style that focuses on characters and story.  The plot concerns an American training camp for soldiers who will be shipping off to Vietnam.  We've seen this type of story before (e.g., Full Metal Jacket) - young soldiers are broken down by the army and then built back up as killing machines, but Tigerland remains fresh, largely due to the talented cast.Tigerland stars Irishman Colin Farrel in his first large role, and he gives a star making performance.  His character (Roland Boz) is anti-army and anti-authority, and he does not see the sense in having people fight wars who are emotionally not equipped to handle it.  He invariably clashes with his superiors as well as his peers (they are punished for his misbehavior).  However, ironically, he ends up helping several of them, particularly Miter, outstandingly played by Clifton Collins Jr. (who also excelled in 2000 as the gay drug dealer Frankie Flowers in ""Traffic"").  Tigerland asks many big questions regarding war and bravery, but it wisely does not provide easy answers.The DVD includes a commentary track by Joel Schumacher.  This track is extremely interesting, as Schumacher describes how he had a small budget and how he managed to do what he needed to do for the film.  The DVD also includes Colin Farrel's screen tests, which are fascinating.  Farrel is a compelling actor who currently has a number of high profile films in the can, including ""Hart's War"" with Bruce Willis and the Steven Speilberg/Tom Cruise film, ""Minority Report.""
