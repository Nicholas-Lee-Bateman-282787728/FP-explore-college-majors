Giroux,"[16, 31]",The movie itself is harmless entertainment-what concerns me is Olive Films which I have noticed over the last few months has been getting the rights to quite a few older pictures-they are releasing these without being closed captioned or subtitled  and have a fairly high price on them-this is disturbing to me because along with the new fad of releasing older films on dvd-r with no sdh or subtitles is putting too many movies  I would like to have unavailable to me (the dvd-r's are also overpriced for what is being offered). So it is really discouraging to find when a company is finally offering an oportunity to view the older films they are doing it no better than the dvd-r people-without regard to the MANY who need sdh or subtitles.,3,Olive Films???,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,742,"['movie', 'harmless', 'entertainment-what', 'concerns', 'Olive', 'Films', 'have', 'noticed', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'been', 'getting', 'rights', 'quite', 'few', 'older', 'pictures-they', 'are', 'releasing', 'being', 'closed', 'captioned', 'subtitled', 'have', 'fairly', 'high', 'price', 'them-this', 'disturbing', 'new', 'fad', 'releasing', 'older', 'films', 'dvd-r', 'sdh', 'subtitles', 'putting', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'unavailable', 'dvd-r', 'are', 'also', 'overpriced', 'what', 'being', 'offered', 'really', 'discouraging', 'find', 'when', 'company', 'finally', 'offering', 'oportunity', 'view', 'older', 'films', 'are', 'doing', 'better', 'dvd-r', 'people-without', 'regard', 'MANY', 'who', 'need', 'sdh', 'subtitles']",N/A

On the other hand, it gives us a chance to see a bevy of comedy actors who were capable of producing High Hilarity in other hands than those of William Castle. Oh, yes, note Barry Gordon, who, among many comedy roles, following his stint in law school, became the longest running head of the Screen Actors Guild, the performing artists union (beating out the earlier Presidencies of Ronald Reagan and Charlton Heston by a year). The film has some laughs, if you are in the right mood, and never is really bad, so that it is watchable and, for some or many, as the case may be, can be a moderately enjoyable vehicle.

I'm always buying stuff that I remember as being &#34;awesome&#34; when I was a kid, only to find those things aren't worth a damn. This movie is a perfect example. I saw this flick when I was about 12 and especially liked the sexy servant girl ghost.Ordered it online, and received the movie promptly. Kudos to Amazon for their amazing delivery work. Couldn't wait to watch it and popped it in as soon as I got to my living room. What followed was 100 minutes of tedium. The humor is very mild, at best. The crux of the plot has to do with the ghosts being destructive and the teenage son getting blamed by the parents. Dull stuff, believe me.The mother in the movie is definitely a straight up MILF though, and the servant girl ghost was just as sexy as I remembered.There is a reason this movie is largely forgotten...it's boring. I guess at the time it was a novel idea..but the film definitely hasn't stood up well. If you can watch it on TV go for it.
