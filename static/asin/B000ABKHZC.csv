It is the story of the Oblong family, who live in the valley where all the toxic waste and sewers run from the rich houses up on the Hill and Globocide chemical plant. The people in the valley are thus deformed and every background scene shows high tension wires and an eerie yellow sky. Given the apparent realities of sick communities and irresponsible corporate behavior, the Oblongs satirizes this reality and challenges our expectations. Back in 2000, Americans were still enthusiastic about our super economy and the economic development which characterized the 1990s. A cynical show about an exploited and abused family did not make the cut. In today's world of financial meltdown and rampant corporate corruption, the underlying premise of The Oblongs is much more relevant. The show is not always a barrel of laughs, but it is nonetheless entertaining and intriguing.

I only vaguely remembered seeing the cartoon, and I don't think I ever watched even one entire episode. I was intrigued though and so I picked up the show. Wow, I don't know what I was expecting but WOW. Some of what comprises this series is clever. A lot of it is dark, dark humor, a coffin leaking fluid, a disfigured Debbie, etc. Some of what is here is funny, ""sex as white noise to help Milo sleep"". All in all though I found a lot of the material to be too politically tainted ""she's white and she has a bible, we should listen to her"", to be funny. The author seems pretty creepy and scary. I don't think it is all an act. The guy seems angry. I pulled up a picture of him on the internet and he was wearing a t-shirt that simply said FAG. Overall the art and the animation is what pleased me the most. I grew pretty tired of characters like ""Pickles"". Mostly I guess I enjoyed Milo, Bobby the father and the little toad girl. The girl without a jawwas just too gross though. She grossed and creeped me the hell out. I enjoyed the Debbies though. This has got to be one of the weirdest cartoons ever made. Oh, and I didn't like the girl with the tumor or wart on her head either. She looked and acted like a Raggedy Ann doll. She was pretty creepy as well.
