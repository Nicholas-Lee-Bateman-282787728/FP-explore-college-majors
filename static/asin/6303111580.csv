357439,ANY46RC9MF6DB,6303111580,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[2, 11]","I can understand people's appreciation of this film if they just view it as a clever mystery, but ""The Mirror Cracked From Side to Side"" is so obviously based on the life of Gene Tierney, a beautiful actress from the 1940s and 1950s, that it surprised me when Hollywood made a film of the story. Tierney was a significant star and you'd think Hollywood would have had more respect for her. Though her story  wouldn't have affected the English as much, it was still unpleasant to see  ""Mystery"" do it.Gene Tierney's tragedy was well known at the time.  She went to a outing for American soldiers during WW2, and one of the female soldiers , who had German Measles, got out of a sick bed to see her.  Tierney, who was pregnant, came down with the malady and as a result had a developmentally disabled child.  I don't know how well the link between German Measles and retardation was known during WW2, but it became very well known eventually and Tierney had a breakdown, supposedly because of it.Tierney was still alive when the Taylor/Hudson movie came out and I couldn't understand how Hollywood could utilize her tragedy for entertainment purposes.Of course Christie wrote a great mystery ""Murder on the Orient Express"" based on the Lindbergh tragedy, but the movie didn't come out until over 40 years later and it wasn't a case of Hollywood exploiting one of its own.",1,An Unpleasant Surprise,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,1369,"['can', 'understand', 'people', 'appreciation', 'film', 'just', 'view', 'clever', 'mystery', 'Mirror', 'Cracked', 'From', 'Side', 'Side', 'so', 'obviously', 'based', 'life', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'beautiful', 'actress', '1940s', '1950s', 'surprised', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'film', 'story', 'Tierney', 'was', 'significant', 'star', ""'d"", 'think', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'respect', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'affected', 'English', 'much', 'was', 'still', 'unpleasant', 'see', 'Mystery', 'do', 'it.Gene', 'Tierney', 'tragedy', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'time', 'went', 'outing', 'American', 'soldiers', 'WW2', 'one', 'female', 'soldiers', 'who', 'had', 'German', 'Measles', 'got', 'sick', 'bed', 'see', 'Tierney', 'who', 'was', 'pregnant', 'came', 'down', 'malady', 'result', 'had', 'developmentally', 'disabled', 'child', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'well', 'link', 'German', 'Measles', 'retardation', 'was', 'known', 'WW2', 'became', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'eventually', 'Tierney', 'had', 'breakdown', 'supposedly', 'it.Tierney', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'when', 'Taylor/Hudson', 'movie', 'came', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'utilize', 'tragedy', 'entertainment', 'purposes.Of', 'course', 'Christie', 'wrote', 'great', 'mystery', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'based', 'Lindbergh', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', '40', 'years', 'later', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'Hollywood', 'exploiting', 'one', 'own']",Miss Marple: Mirror Cracked From Side to Side VHS

357443,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6303111580,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 3]","The poor village of Saint Mary Mead is invaded by some American actors and actresses for the shooting of a film. The main actress was actually raised in the village before moving to America. It's obvious Miss Marple does not consider cinema actors as very respectable people, though that is no reason to kill them. But apparently it is by far enough to justify their suicide. The story is sordid about the past, but that is nearly nothing when compared with the sordidness of the present they impose onto themselves and one another. Working conditions of actors and actresses are horrific and producers are the worst exploiters that can exist and they deserve our full and complete condescending contempt. Add into that picture a couple of adopted children, rejected afterwards, and then a real child reduced to an incurable fate by German measles during the pregnancy and you have the squalid reality of this case. So it is nearly nice of Jane Marple to overlook the slight detail that the death of that actress was not entirely natural though it looks suicidal, or maybe not entirely suicidal though it looks absolutely natural, or whatever other mixture with artificial added in the lot.
