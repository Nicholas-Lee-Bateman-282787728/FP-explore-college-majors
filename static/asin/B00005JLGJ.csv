Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson rise to the occassion by making it believable and intense.  Ford portrays the overly harsh commander and Neeson the captain in touch with the men.  Probably the best submarine movie there is, especially when compared to the ridiculous ""Crimson Tide"" and ""U-571"".

600653,A1K6A7JXC1CU81,B00005JLGJ,"Aglio ""Classic Film Lover""","[7, 10]","I really enjoyed watching K-19, The Widowmaker. I thought that Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson both did spectacular jobs acting.I don't know a whole lot about nuclear submarines, so I can't say with any authority if the technical details were correct, but the Art Direction and Set Design both looked very good. Except for a slow moving first hour, Kathryn Bigelow does a very credible job building suspense by the second half. I felt the tension mount as the crew raced to stop the leak with no parts or equipment and little training. You felt a definite sympathy for the captain and his crew as they tired to jury rig some sort of solution.At first, I too was alittle concerned with Harrison Ford playing such a stern martinet of a character. His acting career has been associated with so many cocky gungho characters, that playing the dour Soviet captain seemed like an odd choice.But, the fact of the matter is, he's excellent and you quickly forget that this is the same actor who played Indiana Jones and Han Solo.I would highly recommend this movie for filmgoers who enjoy a good suspense movie. It's a very good movie. It's not a great movie like Das Boot, but it as good as any other quality sub movie such as The Hunt for Red October, The Enemy Below or Run Silent Run Deep. I believe Kathryn Bigelow probably took bits of helpful information from each of those films in order to do K-19.There are probably gaffs here and there involving what real Russians were like at the time. There was only one glaring historical omission that I felt would confirm that the movie was made by a modern American film company and that's the fact that no one in this film SMOKES.The film is set in 1961 and at that time everyone smoked. Period. President Kennedy smoked as did many Europeans, Soviets and average-joe Americans ! I understand that smoking, in general, on a sub is probably considered a detriment. But, it seems to me during the scenes of heavy stress, some sailor or officer or even the captain would have lit up a cigarette to calm their nerves. The Soviets had their own brands of cigarettes that they would have smoked and even if they weren't allowed to smoke below decks, they would have been allowed to smoke while on the top deck or while off duty.That may seem like a small point to pick on, but if you are going to attempt to portray a historical period, you should get the details right.The only other slight problem was the accents. Others have mentioned this before, and they are very distracting. We know that this is a Soviet sub and the movie is from the viewpoint of the Russians, but you don't have to have the actors speaking with faux accents just to prove that they are Russian. We already knew that.However, I wouldn't let that stop people from seeing the movie. I also have to commend the acting job of Peter Sarsgaard, who was wonderful as the green around the gills reactor officer.",4,"K-19, Review",1027814400,"07 28, 2002",2002,2914,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'K-19', 'Widowmaker', 'thought', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'did', 'spectacular', 'jobs', 'acting.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'whole', 'lot', 'nuclear', 'submarines', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'authority', 'technical', 'details', 'were', 'correct', 'Art', 'Direction', 'Set', 'Design', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'slow', 'moving', 'first', 'hour', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'very', 'credible', 'job', 'building', 'suspense', 'second', 'half', 'felt', 'tension', 'mount', 'crew', 'raced', 'stop', 'leak', 'parts', 'equipment', 'little', 'training', 'felt', 'definite', 'sympathy', 'captain', 'crew', 'tired', 'jury', 'rig', 'sort', 'solution.At', 'first', 'too', 'was', 'alittle', 'concerned', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'playing', 'such', 'stern', 'martinet', 'character', 'acting', 'career', 'been', 'associated', 'so', 'many', 'cocky', 'gungho', 'characters', 'playing', 'dour', 'Soviet', 'captain', 'seemed', 'odd', 'choice.But', 'fact', 'matter', 'excellent', 'quickly', 'forget', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Han', 'Solo.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'filmgoers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'suspense', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'Das', 'Boot', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'quality', 'sub', 'movie', 'such', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Enemy', 'Below', 'Run', 'Silent', 'Run', 'Deep', 'believe', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'probably', 'took', 'bits', 'helpful', 'information', 'films', 'order', 'do', 'K-19.There', 'are', 'probably', 'gaffs', 'here', 'there', 'involving', 'what', 'real', 'Russians', 'were', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'glaring', 'historical', 'omission', 'felt', 'would', 'confirm', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'modern', 'American', 'film', 'company', 'fact', 'one', 'film', 'SMOKES.The', 'film', 'set', '1961', 'time', 'everyone', 'smoked', 'Period', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'smoked', 'did', 'many', 'Europeans', 'Soviets', 'average-joe', 'Americans', 'understand', 'smoking', 'general', 'sub', 'probably', 'considered', 'detriment', 'scenes', 'heavy', 'stress', 'sailor', 'officer', 'even', 'captain', 'would', 'have', 'lit', 'up', 'cigarette', 'calm', 'nerves', 'Soviets', 'had', 'own', 'brands', 'cigarettes', 'would', 'have', 'smoked', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'smoke', 'decks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'smoke', 'top', 'deck', 'off', 'duty.That', 'may', 'seem', 'small', 'point', 'pick', 'are', 'going', 'attempt', 'portray', 'historical', 'period', 'should', 'get', 'details', 'right.The', 'only', 'other', 'slight', 'problem', 'was', 'accents', 'Others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'are', 'very', 'distracting', 'know', 'Soviet', 'sub', 'movie', 'viewpoint', 'Russians', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'actors', 'speaking', 'faux', 'accents', 'just', 'prove', 'are', 'Russian', 'already', 'knew', 'that.However', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'people', 'seeing', 'movie', 'also', 'have', 'commend', 'acting', 'job', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'was', 'wonderful', 'green', 'gills', 'reactor', 'officer']",N/A

Disabled in NATO waters and hours away from a possible nuclear meltdown, they are faced with the possibility of an explosion that would dwarf Hiroshima. The real drama is that it is all true. The courage of the crew to expose themselves to massive amounts of radiation in order to save their mates and prevent nuclear war is remarkable. Of course Hollywood takes it's liberties with the setup of the previous captain (Neeson) acting as the new captain's (Ford) XO. This adds a compelling subplot between these two great actors, but takes away from the true story. It is because of this I feel it only deserves 4 stars.BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A sharp picture and strong audio makes this the best version of the film available.

600658,A3C54XWT93R2WY,B00005JLGJ,"Been around this block, several times over","[2, 2]","If we just think of movies as the story-telling equivalent of ancient peoples hearing great tales meant to socialize listeners into internalizing a moral ideal, then we would have to say this film was indeed mythopoetic.  It explore continuity of faithfulness in the face of terrifying provocations to abandon.  And, interstingly enough, it put this tragedy into the setting of a traditional enemy of America, which requires us to stretch a bit beyond our usual ""yellow journalism""-induced prejudices to fully appreciate.  In the end, to me, the most heroic thing about it was its production, its direction, and its enactment.  Bravo to all who dared utter this ""new word"" (as Dosteyevsky would have put it).I am the eldest son in a refugee family from a behind-the-Iron-Curtain country victimized by the Soviets.  Yet I could appreciate the sort of loyalty portrayed here, a type of loyalty that has kept human groups together to the point of giving us civilization with all its admixtures of good and bad.  Such loyalty has always occurred on both our side (the ""right"" side, of course!) and the enemy's side-- even though we tend to be quite quick to call such loyalty on the other guy's side ""fanaticism.""  This is one of those movies that can help prepare us for living in the contemporary global village, where everything we respect comes enbeded in all sorts of shades of agreement and disagreement with our own way of life.  Few things are simply back and white any more.  This movie wrestles with that reality in a manner well worth being watched by any professional struggling with matters of right and wrong, of loyalty to our near-and-dear vs. to ""higher"" principles (i.e., principles that are more abstract, hence applicable to more diverse ethically-challenging situations).I wish I could extend my full appreciation to all the people responsible for this film, for the general public seems not to have done so.  This has disturbed me to no end.  It was a noble effort that deserved Oscar recognition.  But, as I've said already, this film is an instrument of socialization for character that I certainly intend to use with my students-- youth and adult alike.

Each side was developing a secondary nuclear arsenal that would survive an initial attack and then destroy the attacker.In order to assure survival of the secondary attack system, both sides had created nuclear powered submarines that carried nuclear missiles. K-19 is the first such submarine in the Soviet arsenal and in the rush to get it operational; the Soviets cut many corners, leading to fatalities in the construction, hence the nickname, ""the widowmaker.""Harrison Ford stars as a Soviet sub captain that is tasked with commanding K-19 during the initial trials and he is ordered to succeed.

It is a top-drawer, $100,000,000 production all of the way and the two leads are fantastic. Harrison Ford's accent is no worse than Sean Connery's in The Hunt for Red October -- and throughout K-19 he comes across as a much more convincing Russian than any of the actors in that former film. Liam Neeson is also great as usual.The major shortcoming of K-19 is not really its action or tension, but more that it doesn't have much of a dramatic center and comes across as something of a Tony Scott imitation. Ford just walks onto the scene and much of the dialogue is stilted and melodramatic when it needs to be more realistic.  One also gets the impression that facts are being stretched.

While based on an incident from real life, dramatic license has been taken with many of the personal relationships, nuclear physics, and the heroic incidents in the movie.  The making of the film documentary also on the disk points out how much effort they made getting the submarine right to the point of outfitting a real Russian sub to take on the dimensions and look of the actual K-19.  However, if you search the web you can find information on this incident that will make clear how the plot made changes for dramatic effect.Does it really matter that the captain during the building of the sub was also the captain at sea, that the commanders had a good relationship, that the workers going into the chamber to work on the reactor knew they were going to die and made the sacrifice anyway?  I think it does to the extent they could have made a more profound film.  However, this is an action film and it keeps the surfaces moving.  I guess some of the Russians who acted as technical advisors found the licenses taken to be too much.Leaving all that aside, does the film work?  As I said, I think it is a pretty good Hollywood action film.  My children were riveted and found the sacrifice and heroism moving and the radiation sickness disturbing.  I think it is good to get such a story out and recapture just a taste of the psychology of the Cold War in 1961 even its complexities are over simplified in this movie.  I did like the point a Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) makes about the important balance such a nuclear submarine on patrol of the Eastern Seaboard makes when US subs are patrolling the waters around the USSR.Here we end up seeing these Soviet sailors as the heroes and we root for them.  Yes, the movie gets a tad manipulative in trying to make the Cold War into a moral equivalency argument, but not so strongly that you can't set it aside and enjoy the movie for what it is.Liam Neeson is very good and very large for such a small space, but apparently some Russian sailors were.  The actors in the crew are energetic and pull off their roles quite well. The special effects are pretty good.  I do love the story in the making of the film extra that points out the blue light a near critical reactor gives off.  To make that effect they found that a black light shining on quinine water would do the trick.  They tried to save money with powdered quinine, but it didn't work.  So, on the day of the filming they were pouring 700 2-liter bottles of Canada Dry into the set to get the effect right.Enjoy the film.  Respect the heroism.

He wanted to make sure that everything--and I mean everything was as close to the real thing as possible.In real life a U.S. submarine at that time (1960's) had about 102 crew members. A Russion submarine usually has 139 crew members. In real life both the Captian and Executive Officer die within days of coming back to Russia. All the crew members of K-19 are sworn to secrecy. Not until the fall of Communisim in 1988 are the survivors allowed to tell the truth and mourn for their comrades. The movie tells you that seven men died days after coming back to Russia. That part is true. These men risked their lives to save not only the crew on K-19, but possibly the world. The had to go into the nucular reactor and fix the leakage. They were riddled with radiation.But both the captian and the executive officer died as well. There were alot more then twenty men who died from radation within a few years of the accident.

This is probably only exceeded by living in modern day communist North Korea.  But getting back to our story, doing submarine duty while living under the rule of the old regime.  A party movie this isn't.The movie takes the Russian point of view, or at least the Russian point of view that Hollywood would like us to have.  In the not-too-distant past, the Commies have developed a submarine that can launch nuclear missiles while under water.  As this country has a perpetual fear of being invaded, even while still in the business of invading other countries...the successful  completion of this mission will allow Vitali and Irena back home to sleep much better at night.So with a mission as critical as this, the commander for this mission seems to do everything he can.  The Russkies have chosen Indiana Jones himself to run the operation, and he seems to want it to fail from the beginning.  When his crew pleads with him that more time is needed to safely prepare the ship, he tells them they will leave in two weeks whether they drown or not.  Can you imagine the leaders of the Space Shuttle taking this stand?Then, of course, there is the problem of unifying the crew.  With a mission as important as this one, we seem to have a rag-tag group of drunks operating the vessel. It might be a stab at the way the country was in those days, but once again, with a mission so critical, don't you try to have everything right before proceeding?  Indiana Jones answer to this is to take the boat so deep that it actually damages the ship in order to make the crew fear for there lives, and in this respect, somehow grow closer.  I don't buy it.But the biggest problem is that if you've seen one submarine movie, you've seen them all.  They all have lots of men with constant worried looks on their faces.  We have a lot of somber music.  And you have those well-placed creaking sounds designed to make you think the whole egg might break at any moment.  ""The Hunt for Red October"" worked because the submarine action was PART of the whole plot.

This movie is certainly worth seeing if you like to view every submarine move that comes out (like me), or are interested in taking a peek back in history at a [somewhat distorted] account of a significant event in both nuclear history, and MAD / doomsday technology.Be advised though that this treatment has two famous American Actors playing Russians, with less than convincing Russian personas. The very fact that Harrison Ford is in The Widow Maker is an early indicator that the story has been ""Hollywoodized"", and that thesis proves to be correct.The Amazon description of this film states ""seamless special affects"". Oh please. Anyone interested in digital effects knows that water is one of the hardest elements to be portrayed convincingly by the computer. This 2002 effort proves that the limitation has NOT been overcome. Moreover, the submarine in that fake water looks just as fake. I'm sorry, but these special affects look like special affects, and they pulled me right out of the movie... something that the effect of early submarine flicks like 'Run Silent, Run Deep' did not. Lesson: Models still trump CGI in many areas.Still, this treatment being the only dramatization of the real life event is worth one pass. I just wish it had been made outside Hollywood. Of course if you are just looking for a good ride within this genre, 'Das Boot', 'U-571', or 'The Hunt for Red October' provide better returns.

The rest are tales from Uncle Sam.""So when I see in the DVD specials Ms. director and her staff doing such detailed research and work, going to russia and practically rebuild a submarine in US, saying all the time how important it was to get everything as real as possible, how can they blow up all their efforts by not telling the real story.

Polenin is the exact opposite of Vostrikov.  He is well liked by the crew and is willing to take advice from them.The K-19 is the newest is Russian submarine technology.  Capable of firing missiles up and down the American coast, the submarine and its crew set off on their maiden training mission.The crew successfully fires the test missile, but soon another problem develops.  The crew soon realizes that their nuclear reactor which powers the ship has developed a severe leak which threatens to possibly destroy the ship.Volunteers are chosen to go inside the reactor area to try to fix the leak by welding pipes to bypass the leak, but these men soon are suffering from radiation exposure.  Meanwhile, an American destroyer has come upon the crippled sub and has offered assistance.  Vostrikov is determined not to seek help from the &quot;enemy&quot; Americans, and the K-19 does manage to contact another Russian sub and the crew is transferred.I thought this was a very good movie.

It's 1961, and the Soviet's first atomic powered ballistic missile submarine, the K-19, is scheduled for an operational shakedown cruise in the North Atlantic. The USSR wants to show the United States that the latter is not the only world power with waterproof big guns, so to speak, seeing as how the U.S. Navy has put Polaris subs within missile-lobbing range of Leningrad and Moscow.Filmed in Canada and Moscow, this ""Hollywood"" version of the story has Captain Polenin (Liam Neeson) as commander of the K19 while it's still under construction in Murmansk. In a bad career move, he's vociferously unhappy about the quality of the boat's construction, and outspokenly suggests it's not ready for its first sea trial. Enter Captain Vostrikov (Harrison Ford), an in-law of a Politburo big shot, who takes command with Polenin as his executive officer. The submarine is duly launched, though the champagne bottle fails to break - a harbinger of bad luck, and off it goes to prove itself as the newest protector of the Motherland. At first, it looks like the operational sea trial will be a smashing triumph when the K19 successfully launches one of its three ballistic missiles. Take that, you Yankee imperialist dogs! But then, on its way under new orders to take up a patrol station off the eastern U.S. seaboard, the K19 develops a leak in its nuclear reactor's cooling system that gives a new dimension to the phrase ""in hot water"".Borrowing and fixing up an actual Russian sub on permanent display in Florida (only in America!) for the exterior shots, and re-creating ten submarine compartments accurate down to the smallest details for the interior camera work, the producers of K19: THE WIDOWMAKER have achieved perhaps the most authentic looking sub film since DAS BOOT. (The interior sets of the film make Sean Connery's ""Red October"" look like the starship Enterprise.) And, something you don't see every day, there are no female players to clutter things up with mushy stuff outside of a very brief scene where the girls left behind are kissing the sailors good-bye. Otherwise, this is all Guy Stuff spearheaded by two superb performances from Ford and Neeson. Though the former will be perceived as the actor in the leading role, Neeson is right there breathing down his neck, and an argument could be made to nominate both for an Oscar in the Leading Role category. Perhaps not since HEAT (Pacino and De Niro) have two major male stars played so powerfully well together.K19 serves to remind Americans that in the Cold War, or any war, heroism, sacrifice, honor and duty are not attributes limited to just the home team.

Harrison Ford, as the lead actor, exudes his exacting acting chops in this role of stern paternalistic ship captain. However, this ship is a Soviet submarine, this captain is also Soviet and extremely loyal to the mother country.Based on a true story, this film is the first by an American to present a Soviet perspective. It's one of those submarine movies--you know, dark, dank, and claustrophobic. I hadn't planned on watching it--its being a submarine movie--until I saw that Liam Neeson was also involved. Later I learned that Kathryn Bigelow directed it. I'm not sure where this movie fits in with her Academy Award winning film, but this one surely contains glowing effects of her directorial power. Quite simply, ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" is a riveting film.Ford's character has replaced the regular captain (Neeson) for this maiden voyage of the K-19, a ship destined for important matters. It carries Russian's first nuclear warheads. The Soviet intent is to place the submarine along the eastern coast of the United States, an excellent location to release its warheads if need be.However, like the Titanic, K-19 has Fate hovering over it and through it. One reactor springs a leak and men must go into its chambers to repair the damage. Since radiation suits are no prevention for such major proximity, each man knows he will die. The most tragic is the young lieutenant who was planning an eminent marriage.(Ford's captain is stern, disciplined, and exacting. Neeson's is Hail-fellow-well-met, we're all buddies in this together. Of course, there is rumbling aboard ship. Ford's leadership is challenged. Neeson must make the best decision.)Once the reactor is repaired, the sub heads to the Atlantic Ocean. However, the reactor fails again. The captain can choose to sacrifice his men and world peace--the warhead will explode and destroy a nearby American ship or they can ask the American captain for help in getting the men out of harm's way.The film is riveting, fast-paced, and nuanced. It is also a tribute to the men who served and sacrificed their health and lives to prevent a major global disaster. Soviet leaders refused to recognize them because they saw the event as failure.

But hold on, there is a problem; the Soviet Union is staffed with incompetents!!(one of communism's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel). The menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go. It leaks, and it is cobbled together with substandard parts. After heading out to sea, there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits. The men receive lethal doses of radiation, but unfortunately the doctor doesn't know anything about radiation sickness...he is only giving them aspirin. Before long radiation begins to permeate the ship. The entire crew is in danger. The officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the Americans, while others want to save face for the Soviet Union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die. As the submarine becomes more and more disabled, as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking, as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby American destroyer, as the submarines's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat, the dread of the crew is really palpable.

600704,A27KNXAROMSJ7A,B00005JLGJ,"Kelly L. Norman ""li'l rock & roller""","[6, 6]","""K19: The Widowmaker"" is a somewhat slow-moving military film focusing on a Soviet sub during the Cold War.  Its saving grace isn't the acting by Harrison Ford, who can't seem to keep a good aim at a Russian accent, but a nuclear accident and the sailors'reactions to it in the second half of the film.  Although Ford basically puts in his expected days' work, Neeson and the other actors do a remarkable job, especially in the scenes in which they must risk their lives to attempt to repair the sub, and decide whether to accept an offer of help from a nearby US ship.Much to the horror of American unions, Osetian superconductor Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky (formerly Kirov) orchestra provided the soundtrack for this film when they happened to be in Washington, D.C. at the Lincoln Center for some other performance.  It was a big to-do.  In the end, the film went to press with the Russians on the tape.  (Gergiev has been quoted as saying all he knew were that the filmmakers told he and his musicians that everything was fine; he figured they'd work it out with the union.  One assumes they did.)One further note: shortly after this film was released theatrically, I remember borrowing from the library a Soviet-made VHS about an *American* sub that got into the same sort of trouble that K-19 did, with the crew even balking at the help of a Russian vessel.  It was exactly the same story, the other way round.  I wish I could recall the name, but it was long before I started doing these reviews.

This film is way more true to life than the idiotic fantasy that was 'U-571', in which Americans won the second world war by capturing a cipher machine (FYI, it was a British crew who captured the machine and anyway the Brits already had one, reverse-engineered by Polish intelligence and given by them to British intelligence in one of the more stunningly generous acts of wartime cooperation).The important thing is not so much how doggedly authentic the story is. After all, Wolfgang Petersen's classic 'The Boat', surely the ultimate sub movie ever in its original miniseries form, is fictional. What matters is the quality of the story, and the story told here in K-19 is profoundly touching. Harrison Ford seems really engaged for the first time in a long time, Liam Neeson is properly cast for a change as a slightly ambiguous figure (instead of just as a nice guy) and Peter Sarsgaard is heartbreaking as the head of the team that attempts to repair K-19's reactor.  'K-19' has an emotional depth and sense of tragedy that most movies set in submarines simply don't come close to.  ('The Hunt for Red October' may be the most famous sub movie of recent times, but it suffers severely from being based on a Tom Clancy novel.)Kathryn Bigelow's films have veered between genuinely eerie (Near Dark, The Loveless), silly (Point Break, Blue Steel) and romantic but a bit daft (Strange Days). For my money, this is the first movie she's made that her fans don't have to apologise for. So who cares that the crew all have silly Russian accents? Like you'd prefer that Harrison Ford sounded American and Liam Neeson sounded like he was from Ballymena? The sadness and grimness of life in the USSR have not generally been paid attention to by US filmmakers, who for the most part have been content to portray Soviet military personnel as cannon fodder, but this is a brave effort and a gripping and affecting movie.

Five years in the researching and making, it brings the viewer back to 1961 and the world of the Soviet Navy.  This was the height of the cold war and the U.S. and the Soviet Union were in an arms race.  Both had nuclear power and war was indeed a possibility.Harrison Ford is cast as the strong willed captain of the ship; Liam Neeson is the Executive Officer in charge.  Ford is tough and pushes the men hard, exposing them to danger in order to create loyalty and make them a team.  Neeson, who was the original captain and was replaced by Neeson, is more cautious.  There is constant conflict between these two men regarding command decisions.  And then, an accident happens.  There's a leak in a nuclear reactor and it has to be repaired.From the very first frame of the film I was on the edge of my seat.  The tension kept getting stronger and never let up.  I couldn't stop watching and the 138 minutes of the film just flew.  I learned about submarines, nuclear power, and the devastating effects of radiation poisoning.  I also got to know the two strong leaders as well as their crew and felt real emotion over their dilemma.  It is a story of heroism and courage.  And the fact that is true makes it even more exciting.The only thing that didn't seem authentic was that it was in English and the men spoke with Russian accents.  But after I got used to that, I was completely involved in the high drama of the story.  The acting was excellent.  And I have nothing but praise for the director, Kathryn Bigelow and the special effects and cinematography.  I felt I was right there.Later, I watched all special features.  It was fascinating to learn about way an old Russian submarine was actually restored and refitted to match the exact specifications of the real one.  It was also fascinating to see all the time and effort it takes to show one short scene of the submarine rising through the ice.  These features were a welcome addition to the DVD and really enhanced my experience of the film.This is a scary film.  And there's much to learn from it.

The movie has few points of real tension, and the acting is good, but nowhere's near the performances of Hackman and Washington. There is also much less emphasis on the threat of global nuclear war.

The puzzeling thing is that that very point was only brought up in passing. More focus is given to the spread of radiation through the ship and the sacrifices made by sailors going INTO the reactor to fix it... which of course was suicide.Overall.... This movie was ok, but falls far short of the standards set by U571, Crimson tide and The Hunt for Red October. Less action, less drama, and the acting is good, but nothing that deserves an oscar either. And by the way... there isn't a single engagment in this movie. No underwater or above water battles. So if you're looking for action or combat look elsewhere. If you want a decent military (specifically Submarine) drama, that shows self-sacrifice, loyalty, and the futility of the cold war (as well as the devotion the soviets had to communism even under the opressive and uinfair regime they were subject to), then this movie will be worth watching.

My only beef is with the full-length commentary by the director and photographer on the DVD.  It drones on and on in a self-congratulatory banter between the two and extols the virtues of the different crew and cast members and their prowess in making the film without actually commenting on the scene itself.  We have to take their word that they researched the story thoroughly - which I don't doubt.  But it would have been nice, as the movie progressed, to let us know when editorial license was taken.  For example, it would have been fascinating to learn a little bit more about the encounter with the American destroyer and about the Soviet sailors mooning the American chopper taking pictures of them. Did this actually happen?  It would have made for a nice human-interest sidebar.  And yet, these two kept on droning through this and other scenes.

600711,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00005JLGJ,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I liked this solid, well made submarine thriller, describing a tragedy which really happened. Below, more of my impressions with limited SPOILERS.Made in 2002, directed by Kathryn Bigelow, this film tells a true story. ""K-19"" was a real Soviet nuclear-powered submarine, the first of eight units of Project 658 known to NATO as Hotel-class, commissioned in November 1960. This was the first Soviet submarine to be in the same time nuclear powered AND armed with ballistic missiles. On 4 July 1961, when conducting exercises near southern Groenland, ""K-19"" developed a major leak in her reactor coolant system. The reactor temperature rose uncontrollably, threatening to cause a meltdown, which would result in the loss of the ship and the crew. This film tells the story of the accident itself and of everything what happened later...Kathryn Bigelow tried to stick to the real story as much as she could, but there are of course some differences, one of the most important being the nickname of ""K-19"", which in reality after 1961 was ""Hiroshima"" - it was NEVER called ""widowmaker"" by Soviet sailors. There are also some other, rather minor differences, but I can not detail them more without giving too much spoilers about the plot...This is a very masculine film, with an exclusively masculine cast and both main stars - Harrison Ford as the skipper, Captain Vostrikov and Liam Neeson as the Executive Officer, Captain Polenin - are excellent, as usual. With the exception of Christian Camaro (""Dexter"", ""Twilight"" saga) and Peter Sarsgaard (""The Skeleton Key"", ""Flightplan"") most of other actors were completely unknown to me, but they all did well too.Kathryn Bigelow has a kind of special touch which makes her film feel and look REAL - and it is also visible in that one. We can not only hear and see but even almost smell the fear and despair of Soviet sailors who must now share their ship with an invisible, merciless, destroying angel of radioactivity. She also kept this whole thing strongly under control and as the result made a very honest film mixing the submarine theme with a disaster movie and a thriller.The one thing which I found weak - and sorry for the SPOILER here - is the whole ""Third World War"" menace thing. As in the real story, here there is an American destroyer which at one moment will follow the crippled submarine and even ask the Soviets if they are in need of assistance. Which also means, that almost from the beginning, US Navy Headquarters and the whole NATO knew that ""K-19"" was in deep, deep trouble. Therefore, even if the reactor meltdown resulted in contamination of neighbouring NATO installations, there was absolutely NO WAY Western alliance could interpret this as an attack... Also, the very idea that a nuclear reactor meltdown could cause the detonation of nuclear warheads carried by ""K-19"" is simply LUDICROUS! If a nuclear warhead is not prealably correctly armed with the introduction of special codes (and in time of peace it almost never happens), you can throw it into fire, whack it with a sledgehammer or make an elephant danse can-can on it - and yet, even if it may develop radioactive leaks, it will NOT explode. This useless ""Third World War"" threat thingy hurt this film a little for me...Bottom line, I liked this film, but it is not as good as some other Kathryn Bigelow films, like ""Strange days"" or ""Near dawn"". Therefore, I can give to it only four stars - but it is nevertheless a very honest watch.

600712,AK9UPC78LIPIR,B00005JLGJ,maelje,"[2, 3]","For some reason, I was skeptical about ""K-19."" For one thing, the film had been a box-office bomb, reportedly costing $100 million to make and earning back only two-thirds of that cost, and that's counting domestic AND foreign receipts. For another, it starred Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson in the two lead roles, and I HATE it when Westerners play Soviets.But when I finally decided to watch it, I could not tear myself away. I came away from the viewing having been convinced by the special effects, tightly woven plot and great performances. Ford is excellent and Neeson is even better, and the supporting cast does just a tremendous job.Also, what could have been a weakness turns out to be a strength. Most WWII sub movies I've seen involve some kind of variation on the following: Destroyer drops depth charges trying to kill German sub below. Sub crew is terrified, but sub somehow survives. Sub torpedoes convoy, then gets comeuppance of some kind at hands of Allies. And most Cold War sub movies also follow a pattern, this one involving the threat of the release of nuclear weapons that could destroy the world. ""K-19"" is different; as others here have written, it is based on true events involving two separate Soviet nuclear sub disasters in which there were reactor malfunctions.So: The enemy here isn't the guy commanding the enemy boat; the enemy is radiation itself. Director Kathryn Bigelow handles this theme perfectly, making it so harrowing that we can't look away, and showing incredible compassion for the sailors who are ordered into the reactor room to deal with the catastrophe. Bigelow became the first woman to win the Oscar for Best Director with ""The Hurt Locker,"" but she's also directed cult classics such as the vampire-noir ""Near Dark."" Her work on ""K-19"" is nothing less than superb.Her efforts in making us empathize with the sub's crew avoid being jingoistic apologia for the Soviet system thanks to her brutal depiction of the so-called Soviet ""leadership"" -- the military and Politburo figures are depicted as a gang of ruthlessly corrupt incompetents who are capable of incredible self-delusions. During the Cold War itself, I might have wondered if Bigelow hadn't gone too far with this, but history has proven that the Soviet Union's political machine was nothing less than ghastly.Without spoiling the end of the film, I will just say that it involves a shift in time and perspective. I bring this up because it is incredibly moving -- a fitting conclusion to a fine film.""K-19"" is now on my short list of great submarine films. I believe it stands well with titles such as ""Das Boot,"" ""Crimson Tide,"" ""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""U-571."" But you don't have to be a sub geek like me to appreciate it.

The settings were very realistic, made possible by one of the last of the late 50's and early 60's era diesel-electric submarines that they bought for the movie.Ford and Neeson turn in excellent performances. Ford's part starts out with him being a real hard-nosed officer, different from his usual more benevolent on-screen persona. But by the end of the movie he shows his more human side, and he does what's right for the safety of his men, despite Moscow's orders otherwise.Neeson, however, had the more sympathetic role, overall.This reminds me of another sub incident the Russians had. They tried to do a test where they fired off all the missiles as once. The sub started taking on so much water with all the silos open that it would have sunk before they all launched. So they found out they had to stagger them, creating a much slower launch sequence.The crew had to struggle against every conceivable Soviet bureaucratic screw-up. They didn't have real radiation suits, they lost their original ship's doctor, Ford fires the best reactor officer in the fleet and gets a newbie just out of school, basic electronic equipment keep blowing out or doesn't work, including critical gauges on the reactor, and worst of all, the emergency backup-cooling system on the reactor wasn't installed, which might have averted the entire disaster.Overall, a fine movie.

The Soviets in their rush to get a nuclear deterrent off the U.S. coast seemed to have cut corners on manufacturing and quality control of this submarine. We see some of this in the opening scenes of the film. This movie depicts an actual event that took place in 1961. The crew nicknamed the boat the widow maker because ten people associated with the boat died before it ever left the dock. The one thing I appreciated most about this film is that the submarine sets look real. Both the exterior and interior shots look as if they were shot on the real K-19.Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson play the Soviet Naval officers that appear to be at odds aboard the nuclear sub K-19 on how it should be commanded. Ford's character is the iron-willed captain while Neeson does a great job as the popular executive officer. Add to this a cast of many young actors who performed very well as the boats crew. This is not a war picture per se. So if that is what you are looking for, this movie is not for you. The movie is about true courage, duty, honor and sacrifice as the crew deals with a nuclear reactor system that is leaking. Add to this that this time in history is the height of the Cold War; there was a U.S. Military vessel nearby and a small NATO base that would all be destroyed if the reactor went critical.

This film deals directly with the Soviet mindset (read: xenophobic), in general, and the utter lack of understanding in dealing with Atomic power, in particular.The Soviet Union would not see the errors of their ways, until the Chernobyl disaster. On the K19, nuclear power would make this submarine the flagship of the Soviet Navy. As we see at the beginning of the film, it's Captain is deservedly frustrated with the Soviet procurement system that delivers sub-standard parts to be fitted to it's ""flagship"". He utters his displeasure publicly, which gets him demoted to Executive Officer, and a hardline Captain that has but one objective: To ""successfully"" test and evaluate the K19's abilities to function as a strategic weapon.Add to this volatile mix a green Reactor Officer, who replaces the original Reactor Officer, after the latter is relieved of duty for drunkenness (which is to plague the Soviet Forces, as it does it's Citizens). Nothing good can come of this, and that assessment is proven right, when the Captain issues orders that at first glance, puts the boat in direct danger of foundering. The boat does well, after all, but the tension between the two Senior Officers places the rest of the K19's Officers to rally behind the XO, and rally they do, after one of the K19's reactors goes critical, because of (here we go again) shoddy workmanship.During the crisis, the XO relinquishes command back to the Captain, and it is here, where we see the crew work as one to not only save the boat, but themselves as well. The first seven crewmen to affect repairs to the reactor are sure goners, as the levels of radiation in the reactor room are well past lethal. Repairs are successful, after the second try, and the Captain makes the difficult decision to surrender the boat to American Authorities, because he realises that to wait for help from Soviet Naval Authorities means there will likely be no one left alive to see the boat limp home. All this becomes unnecessary when another Soviet sub comes to the K19's aid!During the Captain's Mast, those Officers who were able to testify to the actions of the Captain during this crisis all came forward to state that the Captain issued orders that saved the boat, and the men left in his care, as well as the Soviet Union, from Nuclear attack by the United States, were the worst to happen, after the disaster. For all this, he never commanded another vessel for the remainder of his career. The dedication at the end of the film gives one a sobering view of how the Soviet Machine regarded it's human component.There are thrills and chills aplenty in this film. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are effective as Captain Vostrikov and the Captain-demoted-to-XO Polenin. Peter Sarsgaard plays the green Reactor Officer very well, and is quickly becoming an Actor to watch for.There are special features of note on the DVD, such as a ""making of"", and three featurettes on the technical aspect of creating the K19 for the screen.

I'm not talking about a moment of pure grief, but a solid, throughout feeling of sadness. In my mind, it ranks only second to the opus of Schindler's List.The Russian Navy has developed a state of the art submarine for 1961. They're counting on this new sea bearing vessel to be their upper hand in the cold war. The project under the leadership of Capt. Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) has fallen behind schedule and the Soviets will not tolerate this project not starting on schedule and Capt. Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) is brought in to get the ship ready on time. The problem is, the staff is undermanned and undersupplied. Also, they are loyal to their original captain, not the new one, making Vostrikov's job that much harder. The crew is wary of the ship already. 7 men died building it and 3 more have died since.The sub leaves dock, smooth sailing for the most part as their missile test is a success. Vostrikov is constantly drilling his crew, much to their dislike, and they make no secret of their wish to return under Polenin, who is serving as Vostrikov's assistant.A coolant leak happens, the nuclear reactor is threatening meltdown. It was inevitable, but it's done in a way that tries to avoid as many sub clich&eacute;s as it can. The only way to fix the problem is to run water into the reactor, but that requires me to enter the reactor room where deadly radiation is present. This is where the film really gets going and a human element really hits you. Sailors are suffering radiation illness and the sub is still shaky. Adding more intrigue, an American destroyer finds the sub and offers help, but Vostrikov doesn't want to give the US the victory of obtaining their space age sub but Polenin is pushing to ask for help so the sailors can leave the ship as radiation is slowly overtaking the entire vessel.Ford and Neeson are both superb in this film. Odd Russian accents aside, both actors are firmly rooted in their characters and have a great respectful yet on the edge relationship that takes a few odd turns along the way. A solid cast all around anchors the film in its human story. It's hard to capture too many new film styles inside a submarine, but the picture and action seem to flow pretty well considering the surroundings.I wasn't totally sure what to think going into this film but going out I just felt sad and a bit horrified. As this was based off an actual event, I can only imagine what kind of things ran through the mind of those men who went through something like this. I think the most important thing I took out of it was how we, as humans, understand the importance of sacrificing so much of ourselves for one another without thinking twice.",4,Solid Underwater Thrill Ride with a big Human Element,1028505600,"08 5, 2002",2002,2799,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'was', 'maybe', 'second', 'saddest', 'feeling', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'moment', 'pure', 'grief', 'solid', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'mind', 'only', 'second', 'opus', 'Schindler', 'List.The', 'Russian', 'Navy', 'developed', 'state', 'art', 'submarine', '1961', ""'re"", 'counting', 'new', 'sea', 'bearing', 'vessel', 'be', 'upper', 'hand', 'cold', 'war', 'project', 'leadership', 'Capt', 'Mikhail', 'Polenin', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'fallen', 'schedule', 'Soviets', 'will', 'not', 'tolerate', 'project', 'not', 'starting', 'schedule', 'Capt', 'Alexei', 'Vostrikov', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'brought', 'get', 'ship', 'ready', 'time', 'problem', 'staff', 'undermanned', 'undersupplied', 'Also', 'are', 'loyal', 'original', 'captain', 'not', 'new', 'one', 'making', 'Vostrikov', 'job', 'much', 'harder', 'crew', 'wary', 'ship', 'already', '7', 'men', 'died', 'building', '3', 'more', 'have', 'died', 'since.The', 'sub', 'dock', 'sailing', 'most', 'part', 'missile', 'test', 'success', 'Vostrikov', 'constantly', 'drilling', 'crew', 'much', 'dislike', 'make', 'secret', 'wish', 'return', 'Polenin', 'who', 'serving', 'Vostrikov', 'assistant.A', 'coolant', 'leak', 'nuclear', 'reactor', 'threatening', 'meltdown', 'was', 'inevitable', 'done', 'way', 'avoid', 'many', 'sub', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'only', 'way', 'fix', 'problem', 'run', 'water', 'reactor', 'enter', 'reactor', 'room', 'where', 'deadly', 'radiation', 'present', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'going', 'human', 'element', 'really', 'Sailors', 'are', 'suffering', 'radiation', 'illness', 'sub', 'still', 'shaky', 'Adding', 'more', 'intrigue', 'American', 'destroyer', 'sub', 'help', 'Vostrikov', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'US', 'victory', 'obtaining', 'space', 'age', 'sub', 'Polenin', 'pushing', 'ask', 'help', 'so', 'sailors', 'can', 'leave', 'ship', 'radiation', 'slowly', 'overtaking', 'entire', 'vessel.Ford', 'Neeson', 'are', 'superb', 'film', 'Odd', 'Russian', 'accents', 'aside', 'actors', 'are', 'firmly', 'rooted', 'characters', 'have', 'great', 'respectful', 'yet', 'edge', 'relationship', 'few', 'odd', 'turns', 'way', 'solid', 'cast', 'anchors', 'film', 'human', 'story', 'hard', 'capture', 'too', 'many', 'new', 'film', 'styles', 'submarine', 'picture', 'action', 'seem', 'flow', 'pretty', 'well', 'considering', 'surroundings.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'totally', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'going', 'film', 'going', 'out', 'just', 'felt', 'sad', 'bit', 'horrified', 'was', 'based', 'off', 'actual', 'event', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'kind', 'things', 'ran', 'mind', 'men', 'who', 'went', 'something', 'think', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'took', 'out', 'was', 'how', 'humans', 'understand', 'importance', 'sacrificing', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'thinking', 'twice']",N/A

Ford's action thrillers are usually boxoffice winners, but the public may have seen this one as a war movie, of which there were several earlier in the year. While it takes place on a Russian submarine at the height of the Cold War, it belongs more to the thriller genre than the war genre. While less compelling than ""13 Days"", another film based on true events from the Cold War, but it is quite competent and often exciting.... A crew with divided loyalties aboard a badly built boat.  The movie follows the terrified crew's desperate attempts to save K-19 and themselves.Ford and Neeson, as well as Peter Sarsgaard [who plays the officer in charge of the reactors], are quite good. They are hampered with Russian accents, along with the rest of the cast. The accent was an unfortunate choice, I think. It's unnecessary because every character in the movie is a Russian presumably speaking his native language. Since the audience knows this, the accent is superfluous and distracting.

600725,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JLGJ,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 4]","I became a fan of the &quot;sub&quot; genre after seeing movies like U-571 and The Hunt for Red October. While U-571 was sort of a pastiche of all the other submarine films that went before it, it made me an immediate fan. It also made me realize just how contrived spaceship movies are.Unlike the other films, K-19 - The Widowmaker is about a real incident (like the supposed Red October incident) in which a Russian nuclear submarine's reactor nearly had a catastrophic meltdown just off the eastern coast of the United States in the 1960s. Scary stuff.As a result of this gritty reality, K-19 is powerful in a way that Titanic was powerful. It doesn't matter if the movie isn't quite realistic - the events are so horrible that tension is rife throughout the film. Or at least, it should be.K-19's initial launch is a debacle. In short, the submarine never has a chance to be successful - the men are inexperienced and costs are cut, such that K-19's crew is lucky that it even works at all. Add in the ship's doctor getting run over by a truck, the failure of the christening bottle to break against the sub's hull, and the firing of the chief engineer and it's hard to disagree with the notion that the ship is cursed.The new captain aboard Alexei Vostrikov, played by Harrison Ford, pushes the sub to its limits. The tension rises as he forces the crew to do random drills, forces it to dive to near crushing depths, and rise right through the arctic ice. This by far is the most exciting part of the film - there is no enemy except Vostrikov, and it's nail biting after witnessing the poor construction of K-19. Ultimately, K-19 fires its test missile, signaling a message to America that the Russians could launch a nuclear strike if they wished.Then the sub is pushed to its limits once again, beyond what even Alexei could have feared. They are to patrol the eastern seaboard, right near a NATO base. The ship's original captain, Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) disagrees. Indeed, he disagrees with everything Vostrikov does because he puts the men at risk. I couldn't help but feel contempt for Polenin, who seems so attached to his crew that he no longer has the stomach for war. I'm not sure if that was the director's intent.Unfortunately, the second half of the film drags. The ship's engines begin to overheat and the inexperienced chief engineer concocts a plan to pipe coolant into the system from the ship's freshwater tanks. Failure means a nuclear explosion &quot;a hundred times worse than Hiroshima.&quot;And so we have a long, slow, miserable, sometimes disgusting foray into the effects of radiation poisoning on the human body. The men who go in have naught but chemical suits rather than radiation suits to protect them. That is, they have no protection at all. So they are exposed for 10 minutes a time in an attempt to minimize the radiation poisoning.Not only doesn't that tactic works, the radiation leak spreads throughout the submarine. Alexei's choice: accept help from the Americans and save the men or sacrifice his crew to retain Soviet secrets. This decision takes a loooong time to resolve. The movie loses a lot of its momentum, almost becoming a different film that's a lot more like The Andromeda Strain.What was most striking about this part of the film was how it's been cribbed in other genres. I couldn't help but be reminded of Wrath of Khan, my favorite Star Trek film. Similar to K-19, an officer takes it upon himself to enter the highly lethal radiation chamber in order to &quot;sacrifice the few to save the many.&quot; It's chilling to imagine that real human beings had to make that choice. It certainly changed my perspective on Wrath of Khan. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing.Ultimately, the Russians on board were treated like traitors instead of war heroes. The men weren't fighting any enemy but the politics of Russia itself, and as such they could never leave the disaster of K-19 as heroes.

I knew that all things submarine fascinate me.  I have always been curious about life aboard a Soviet submarine. Truth be told:  this film delivered on all of the above.The acting:  Superb.  You could feel the emotion coming off the actors.  Being ex-navy myself, I found myself very sympathetic towards the plight of these young men.  Soviet accents were at least attempted in this film, which lended a little more believability.The drama:  Excellent.  Kathryn Bigelow kept the action rolling and, much like in Das Boot, had some very fine camera work done.  You could feel the crampness of the submarine, especially when there were a lot of men in one compartment at the same time..very tight and constricting.  During the key sequences of the film (I won't give them away here..enjoy it for yourself), you felt gloomy and sorrow for them..it was played out and directed that well.  She also used a lot of outside shots of the boat (especially underwater) to remind you that, hey..we're still 200 meters below the surface, and not in a sound stage LOL.The sound:  The theater I saw it in had DTS digital...unfortunately only Ultra-Stereo.  However..the theater was filled with the usual sounds of a sub...creaking hull plates, bubbles coming from the screws, and water rushing by..so you were really immersed in their world.  It was a job well-done by the sound technicians.By the time you leave the theater..you will have experienced the whole gammut of emotions...fear, joy, laughter, comradship, concern, sorrow, relief, elation, etc.  For a movie to do that nowadays is a welcome relief.  It was nice to go see a film that not only made you think, but completely immerse you in it so youre taken away for the 2 hours and 20 minutes of the movie.

600732,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B00005JLGJ,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[3, 4]","At the height of Cold War tension in 1961, the Russian government is in a hurry to deploy their brand new nuclear submarine, the K-19, with orders to test fire a nuclear missile in the north Atlantic. The hope is that such a show of power will discourage America from launching an attack on the motherland. When Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) argues that the ship is unready to begin sea trials as scheduled, he demoted to the position of executive officer and replaced by Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). The barely seaworthy K-19 is sent out as initially planned.Vostrikov tests the crew's physical and mental limits with a series of intensive drills designed to determine what the men and the ship collectively can withstand, creating much tension between the men. After successfully firing the test missile, the K-19 is ordered to take up a position off the American coast, but then disaster strikes as the cooling system of one of the nuclear reactors on board fails. Repeated attempts to repair the leak are unsuccessful and radiation begins to spread through the ship, leaving Vostrikov in a precarious position - he can seek help from the nearby Americans and risk charges of treason at home, or he can wait for a Russian ship to find them and risk the life of every man on board.When I saw that this film was being done by National Geographic, it encouraged me to go see it in theaters. I'm glad I did, for it lived up to my expectations in almost every way. Ford, Neeson, and all the supporting actors turned in wonderful performances. They made their roles very believable. The cinematography was also extremely well done. The few on-shore scenes were shot in the actual locations in Russia where the original events occurred, giving the film an authentic feel. The scenes inside the submarine were shot in sets built to the scale of the actual K-19, helping the viewer comprehend the claustrophobic atmosphere. Both the actors and cameramen do a great job working within the confines of such small spaces.The reality of the radiation leak is dealt with superbly. It is hard to capture an invisible foe on film. Here, in fact, the depiction of men with radiation burns and sickness are so graphic and convincing that I'd warn those with weak stomachs to be careful with this movie. A few scenes are quite disturbing.I must admit that I was extremely dismayed, however (as almost every other reviewer has already mentioned), by the very fake-sounding Russian accents delivered by some of the American members of the cast, most notably Ford himself. But then I have to remind myself: even if the accents on film had been impeccable, the real men on the original K-19 wouldn't have been speaking English in the first place, accent or no. So how realistic can you be? Perhaps it would have been better to scrap the accents altogether and just have the actors use their natural voices. Regardless, I think the accent issue is a minor one. The rest of the acting is terrific and the film loses none of its intensity.The DVD includes a &quot;making of&quot; documentary, and three additional featurettes. It is interesting to see what went into this production - the history, the re-building of the ship, the approach director Kathryn Bigelow took to filming, etc. The actors also offer their insights into the film. All in all I found the movie highly enjoyable. Despite minor discrepancies which are all but inevitable in a successful life-to-film adaptation, it should appeal to Cold War buffs and action/drama fans alike.",4,A gripping true story captured on film!,1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,3537,"['height', 'Cold', 'War', 'tension', '1961', 'Russian', 'government', 'hurry', 'deploy', 'brand', 'new', 'nuclear', 'submarine', 'K-19', 'orders', 'test', 'fire', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'north', 'Atlantic', 'hope', 'show', 'power', 'will', 'discourage', 'America', 'launching', 'attack', 'motherland', 'When', 'Captain', 'Mikhail', 'Polenin', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'ship', 'unready', 'begin', 'sea', 'trials', 'scheduled', 'demoted', 'position', 'executive', 'officer', 'replaced', 'Alexei', 'Vostrikov', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'barely', 'seaworthy', 'K-19', 'sent', 'out', 'initially', 'planned.Vostrikov', 'tests', 'crew', 'physical', 'mental', 'limits', 'series', 'intensive', 'drills', 'designed', 'determine', 'what', 'men', 'ship', 'collectively', 'can', 'withstand', 'creating', 'much', 'tension', 'men', 'successfully', 'firing', 'test', 'missile', 'K-19', 'ordered', 'take', 'up', 'position', 'American', 'coast', 'then', 'disaster', 'strikes', 'cooling', 'system', 'one', 'nuclear', 'reactors', 'board', 'fails', 'Repeated', 'attempts', 'repair', 'leak', 'are', 'unsuccessful', 'radiation', 'begins', 'spread', 'ship', 'leaving', 'Vostrikov', 'precarious', 'position', 'can', 'seek', 'help', 'nearby', 'Americans', 'risk', 'charges', 'treason', 'home', 'can', 'wait', 'Russian', 'ship', 'find', 'risk', 'life', 'man', 'board.When', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'done', 'National', 'Geographic', 'encouraged', 'go', 'see', 'theaters', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'lived', 'up', 'expectations', 'almost', 'way', 'Ford', 'Neeson', 'supporting', 'actors', 'turned', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'made', 'roles', 'very', 'believable', 'cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'few', 'on-shore', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'actual', 'locations', 'Russia', 'where', 'original', 'events', 'occurred', 'giving', 'film', 'authentic', 'feel', 'scenes', 'submarine', 'were', 'shot', 'sets', 'built', 'scale', 'actual', 'K-19', 'helping', 'viewer', 'comprehend', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'actors', 'cameramen', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'working', 'confines', 'such', 'small', 'spaces.The', 'reality', 'radiation', 'leak', 'dealt', 'superbly', 'hard', 'capture', 'invisible', 'foe', 'film', 'Here', 'fact', 'depiction', 'men', 'radiation', 'burns', 'sickness', 'are', 'so', 'graphic', 'convincing', ""'d"", 'warn', 'weak', 'stomachs', 'be', 'careful', 'movie', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'disturbing.I', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'extremely', 'dismayed', 'however', 'almost', 'other', 'reviewer', 'already', 'mentioned', 'very', 'fake-sounding', 'Russian', 'accents', 'delivered', 'American', 'members', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'Ford', 'then', 'have', 'remind', 'even', 'accents', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'impeccable', 'real', 'men', 'original', 'K-19', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'speaking', 'English', 'first', 'place', 'accent', 'So', 'how', 'realistic', 'can', 'be', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'scrap', 'accents', 'altogether', 'just', 'have', 'actors', 'use', 'natural', 'voices', 'Regardless', 'think', 'accent', 'issue', 'minor', 'one', 'rest', 'acting', 'terrific', 'film', 'none', 'intensity.The', 'DVD', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'documentary', 'three', 'additional', 'featurettes', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'went', 'production', 'history', 're-building', 'ship', 'approach', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'took', 'filming', 'etc', 'actors', 'also', 'offer', 'insights', 'film', 'found', 'movie', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'minor', 'discrepancies', 'are', 'inevitable', 'successful', 'life-to-film', 'adaptation', 'should', 'appeal', 'Cold', 'War', 'buffs', 'action/drama', 'fans', 'alike']",N/A

During a series of drills, Neeson and the rest of the crew are leery of their new leader, but after a dangerous but successful test of their limits, the new captain earns the crews, (but not Neeson's) trust. However, when a radioactive leak is discovered and the fate of the ship is up in the air, no one knows whose lead to follow.One of my biggest problems with this film is the first third of it, illustrating drill after drill with a loud, suspenseful soundtrack that tries to make the mostly harmless drills seem more dangerous. The film here seems to be preparing the audience for an inevitable attack from an enemy. All it serves to do in the end is to be misleading so that when that inevitable attack never happens, it proves to be a let down. Also, and perhaps even more annoying, are the poor Russian accents. Everyone, including Ford and Neeson, have wavering accents that are sometimes Russian, sometimes American, and sometimes something else entirely. In fact, without even a single word ever spoken in Russian, the film's authenticity suffers. You never forget that these are all Americans playing Russians. Perhaps if the casting director found more Russian actors for the supporting roles, and the director maybe placed some Russian dialogue in the beginning (such as The Hunt for Red October did), It would have been more convincing.Still, the film is not without merit. Once the radiation leak is discovered the film becomes more interesting and well worth your time. It truly was a harrowing event and the tension finally begins to build here. It's just too bad it took an hour of false tension to get there. If emphasis on the drills had not been pushed as it was, and the atmosphere more authentically Russian, this could have been a solid four star film doing justice to the true events.It's worth a rental as it is, but stick to Das Boot or other submarine thrillers to fill your DVD rack.",3,Flawed but decent submarine drama,1042243200,"01 11, 2003",2003,2419,"['sub-genre', 'submarine', 'dramas', 'K-19', 'Widowmaker', ""n't"", 'compare', 'great', 'films', 'such', 'Das', 'Boot', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Based', 'true', 'story', ""n't"", 'as', 'gripping', 'other', 'films', 'limited', 'potential', 'begin', 'So', 'course', 'couple', 'serious', 'flaws', 'K-19', 'possesses', 'quickly', 'undermines', 'potential.K-19', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'flagship', 'nuclear', 'submarine', 'initial', 'captain', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'replaced', 'new', 'captain', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'series', 'drills', 'Neeson', 'rest', 'crew', 'are', 'leery', 'new', 'leader', 'dangerous', 'successful', 'test', 'limits', 'new', 'captain', 'crews', 'not', 'Neeson', 'trust', 'However', 'when', 'radioactive', 'leak', 'discovered', 'fate', 'ship', 'up', 'air', 'one', 'lead', 'follow.One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'film', 'first', 'third', 'illustrating', 'drill', 'drill', 'loud', 'suspenseful', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'mostly', 'harmless', 'drills', 'seem', 'more', 'dangerous', 'film', 'here', 'be', 'preparing', 'audience', 'inevitable', 'attack', 'enemy', 'do', 'end', 'be', 'misleading', 'so', 'when', 'inevitable', 'attack', 'never', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'Also', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'annoying', 'are', 'poor', 'Russian', 'accents', 'Everyone', 'including', 'Ford', 'Neeson', 'have', 'wavering', 'accents', 'are', 'sometimes', 'Russian', 'sometimes', 'American', 'sometimes', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'fact', 'even', 'single', 'word', 'ever', 'spoken', 'Russian', 'film', 'authenticity', 'suffers', 'never', 'forget', 'are', 'Americans', 'playing', 'Russians', 'Perhaps', 'casting', 'director', 'found', 'more', 'Russian', 'actors', 'supporting', 'roles', 'director', 'maybe', 'placed', 'Russian', 'dialogue', 'beginning', 'such', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'convincing.Still', 'film', 'not', 'merit', 'radiation', 'leak', 'discovered', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'well', 'time', 'truly', 'was', 'harrowing', 'event', 'tension', 'finally', 'build', 'here', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'took', 'hour', 'false', 'tension', 'get', 'there', 'emphasis', 'drills', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'pushed', 'was', 'atmosphere', 'more', 'authentically', 'Russian', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'solid', 'four', 'star', 'film', 'doing', 'justice', 'true', 'events.It', 'worth', 'rental', 'stick', 'Das', 'Boot', 'other', 'submarine', 'thrillers', 'fill', 'DVD', 'rack']",N/A

Essentially, this is the story of one of the early Russian nuclear missile submarines, which is rushed into service without proper testing or equipment, with disastrous results.The story is oddly without heros or villains, except maybe the Russian politicians and admirals who force the sub to sea before it is properly tested and equipped, and of course the architects of the Cold War in general.  At first the viewer is led to believe that Harrison Ford, the Captain, is the villain because he relieves the original Captain of the subm (Liam Nielson) and puts the sub through its paces even though he has admitted that the mission is ""premature.""  But later Ford is shown as a hero, inspiring the loyalty of the crew.  Well, maybe that's how it was.The story certainly highlights the loyalty and courage of the Russian crewmen who enter the nuclear reactor area to try to prevent a meltdown incorrectly portrayed (I think) in the movie as a danger of explosion.  The meltdown danger was real enough--it is said that this would have been an environmental catastrophe on the order of Cherynoble, but much closer to the USA.  The Russian crewmen suffer ghastly maiming and death, as they knew they would, exacerbated by the fact that the sub put to sea without a locker full of radiation suits which the repair crew needs in order to work on the reactor with any hope of surviving the attempt.The movie reminds us that the young men in the Armed Forces of what was then the West's principal enemy were nonetheless largely fine, wholesome lads, as indeed most soldiers are.The story is gripping, but it is also unusually depressing, which is why I only gave this one 3 stars.  Perhaps I am not being completely fair, but that's my opinion.Ford is good, Nielson is good, the rest of the acting is OK.

600742,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLGJ,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 9]","""K-19: The Widowmaker"" is a superb Cold War submarine saga, brilliantly directed by Kathryn Bigelow and featuring solid performances by a first-rate cast.  Based on a true story that occurred in 1961, but which only came to light in the West after the fall of the Soviet Union, ""K-19"" shows how close the world came to experiencing a nuclear explosion thanks to rank Soviet incompetence.  ""K-19"" was the pride of the Russian navy, a nuclear-powered sub that the leaders felt would help the Soviets achieve parity with the United States in the escalating arms race occurring at that time.  But on the boat's maiden voyage things managed to go terribly wrong, thanks mostly to the gross ineptitude of the leaders in charge of building and equipping the boat.  Poorly made, inadequately supplied and lacking the necessary back up plans in case of a dire emergency, the sub set out on its mission with not one but two captains aboard, Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) and Alexi Vostrikov (Harrison Ford), the latter sent in by the Soviet higher-ups to take over the mission after questions arose as to the ability of Polenin to handle such a crucially important mission.  Much of the tension in the film arises from the conflict that develops between the humanitarian instincts of Polenin and the hard-nosed, almost maniacally rigid Vostrikov who seems almost willing to sacrifice the lives of his men rather than to admit defeat of any kind.Working off the screenplay by Christopher Kyle, director Bigalow minimizes the clich&eacute;s usually associated with films set aboard submarines and concentrates instead on the human drama at the story's core.  Sure we have the obligatory scene wherein the obsessed captain, wanting to push both the boat and the crew to their respective limits, ends up ordering that the sub be taken down to near-crush level.  But that scene is kept very short and comprises only a very small part of the whole drama.  Of much greater interest to the filmmakers - and to the audience  - is the way in which the men react to a crisis of almost unimaginable proportions.  When the core nuclear reactor gives way and the men are faced with the threat of death through radiation poisoning, the film becomes both a gripping suspense drama and a poignant study of fear, duty and heroism.  Bigalow keeps the tension high throughout by recording not only the fascinating details of the reactor disaster itself, but also the clash that develops between the two captains as they struggle for power and try to weigh the lives of the men against the importance of the mission and the patriotic call to duty.Technically, the film does a superb job keeping focused on the intense drama of the situation.  With superb editing and sound effects, the film makes us sense what life must really be like aboard that sub.  Bigalow effectively uses the moving camera techniques pioneered by Wolfgang Peterson in ""Das Boot"" to help keep the action flowing.  She is also blessed with a fine cast including Ford and Neeson who play off each other brilliantly, both actors showing the same stubbornness and humanity that define each of their characters, even though they seem to be at loggerheads during much of the time.  Peter Sarsgaard is also excellent as the inexperienced crewmember who struggles with his own conflict between fear and duty, heroism and cowardice.Though the film does become a bit heavy-handed and sentimental in its closing stretches, ""K-19"" is, over all, one of the more intelligent action movies of the past several years.  It also happens to be the best submarine picture since the classic ""Das Boot.""",4,excellent submarine saga,1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,3623,"['K-19', 'Widowmaker', 'superb', 'Cold', 'War', 'submarine', 'saga', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'featuring', 'solid', 'performances', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'occurred', '1961', 'only', 'came', 'light', 'West', 'fall', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'K-19', 'how', 'close', 'world', 'came', 'experiencing', 'nuclear', 'explosion', 'thanks', 'rank', 'Soviet', 'incompetence', 'K-19', 'was', 'pride', 'Russian', 'navy', 'nuclear-powered', 'sub', 'leaders', 'felt', 'would', 'help', 'Soviets', 'achieve', 'parity', 'United', 'States', 'escalating', 'arms', 'race', 'occurring', 'time', 'boat', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'things', 'managed', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'thanks', 'mostly', 'gross', 'ineptitude', 'leaders', 'charge', 'building', 'equipping', 'boat', 'Poorly', 'made', 'inadequately', 'supplied', 'lacking', 'necessary', 'back', 'up', 'plans', 'case', 'dire', 'emergency', 'sub', 'set', 'out', 'mission', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'captains', 'Mikhail', 'Polenin', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Alexi', 'Vostrikov', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'latter', 'sent', 'Soviet', 'higher-ups', 'take', 'over', 'mission', 'questions', 'arose', 'ability', 'Polenin', 'handle', 'crucially', 'important', 'mission', 'Much', 'tension', 'film', 'conflict', 'humanitarian', 'instincts', 'Polenin', 'hard-nosed', 'almost', 'maniacally', 'rigid', 'Vostrikov', 'who', 'almost', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'men', 'rather', 'admit', 'defeat', 'kind.Working', 'off', 'screenplay', 'Christopher', 'Kyle', 'director', 'Bigalow', 'clich', 'eacute', 'usually', 'associated', 'films', 'set', 'aboard', 'submarines', 'concentrates', 'instead', 'human', 'drama', 'story', 'core', 'Sure', 'have', 'obligatory', 'scene', 'wherein', 'obsessed', 'captain', 'wanting', 'push', 'boat', 'crew', 'respective', 'limits', 'up', 'ordering', 'sub', 'be', 'taken', 'down', 'near-crush', 'level', 'scene', 'kept', 'very', 'short', 'only', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'whole', 'drama', 'much', 'greater', 'interest', 'filmmakers', 'audience', 'way', 'men', 'react', 'crisis', 'almost', 'unimaginable', 'proportions', 'When', 'core', 'nuclear', 'reactor', 'way', 'men', 'are', 'faced', 'threat', 'death', 'radiation', 'poisoning', 'film', 'gripping', 'suspense', 'drama', 'poignant', 'study', 'fear', 'duty', 'heroism', 'Bigalow', 'tension', 'high', 'recording', 'not', 'only', 'fascinating', 'details', 'reactor', 'disaster', 'also', 'clash', 'two', 'captains', 'struggle', 'power', 'try', 'weigh', 'lives', 'men', 'importance', 'mission', 'patriotic', 'call', 'duty.Technically', 'film', 'superb', 'job', 'keeping', 'focused', 'intense', 'drama', 'situation', 'superb', 'editing', 'sound', 'effects', 'film', 'sense', 'what', 'life', 'must', 'really', 'be', 'aboard', 'sub', 'Bigalow', 'effectively', 'moving', 'camera', 'techniques', 'pioneered', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'Das', 'Boot', 'help', 'keep', 'action', 'flowing', 'also', 'blessed', 'fine', 'cast', 'including', 'Ford', 'Neeson', 'who', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'brilliantly', 'actors', 'showing', 'same', 'stubbornness', 'humanity', 'characters', 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'loggerheads', 'much', 'time', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'also', 'excellent', 'inexperienced', 'crewmember', 'who', 'own', 'conflict', 'fear', 'duty', 'heroism', 'cowardice.Though', 'film', 'become', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'sentimental', 'closing', 'stretches', 'K-19', 'one', 'more', 'intelligent', 'action', 'movies', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'also', 'be', 'best', 'submarine', 'picture', 'classic', 'Das', 'Boot']",N/A
600743,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JLGJ,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 2]","But first, the plot:Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are Soviet Naval officers at odds aboard the brand-new (in 1961, anyway) nuclear sub K-19.  One of the first nuclear powered submarines to carry nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, K-19 formed the nucleus of the Soviet's sea-borne nuclear deterrent.  Unfortunately, in the rush to get her to sea, the Soviets make few concessions to make her actually sea-worthy.  K-19's cranky electronics fail during a missile-launch drill conducted while the sub is still in dry-dock.  Too principled to blame his crew for equipment malfunctions caused by bad Soviet QA, Neeson gives his vindictive superiors his own name, only to find that he's been demoted to follow the orders of Captain Vestrikov - Ford playing against type as an unfriendly and unsympathetic patriotic Soviet tyrant.  Everything about the sub looks rushed (like the first American missile boat, the real K-19 was actually an attack sub modified to carry a few missiles), but it's more ominous signs that worry the crew.  Before the ship has even sailed, the ship's doctor and several construction workers have perished in freak accidents.  Nevertheless, Ford gets the ship underway, puts the crew through murderous drills and manages to launch a test missile after breaking through polar ice.And then things start going wrong with the reactor.  When a coolant line leaks, reactor temperature starts to climb - nobody knows (not even the rookie reactor officer played by Peter Saarsgard) what will happen when temperature hits 1,000 degrees, though a thermonuclear explosion is assumed.  The crew desperately jury-rig piping to pump water as coolant, a prolonged exercise exposes the workers to high-doses of radiation and spreads toxic throughout the ship.  A lack of needed supplies (there are no radiation suits aboard, so clueless crewmen use the chemical-safe suits instead) and too much free time spurs mutiny against Vestrikov, who seems not to understand the workings of the ship's reactor, but doggedly refuses assistance from the nearby Americans.  Ultimately, the crew will have to come together, and Vestrikov will have to learn how to be a true leader in Neeson's mold.This was a disappointing flick.  The big problem of ""K-19"" is that the film unconvincingly and confusingly depicts the interaction between the sub and crew - it's basically a bunch of angry guys running around a submarine set.  (To its credit, ""K-19"" doesn't try to depict the sub's interior ala ""Red October"" with darkened interiors lit by hi-tech screens - this is 1961!)  We have a fairly cramped sub but even before the accident, the ship has already reduced her crew to being a passive and captive compliment of its CGI exterior.  Because the characters have little to do, their motivations remain opaque (is Ford's character glory seeking, politically narrow-minded or just very demanding when he insists on a dangerous surfacing through pack ice?) and the plot turns incomprehensible (just what are these guys expected to do?).  Also, the flick follows Hollywood movie formula about foreigners to form - these guys are non-Russian actors using unnecessary Russian accents and mannerisms (like Neeson's Slavic grunt when equipment breaks down in the botched missile drill).  I know that these characters aren't Americans, but their ridiculous (if authentic) accents make them sound like foreigners to each other, turn them into generic characters and fail to hide their stilted and artificial dialog.  (Hasn't anybody seen ""Amadeus""?  When you ditch the accents, dialog sounds more natural, not less authentic.)Finally, the flick sets a bad tone when opening with its ""Inspired by actual events"" tag - just what's ""inspired"" here and what are ""the actual events""?",3,Uninspired by actual events,1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,3756,"['first', 'plot', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'are', 'Soviet', 'Naval', 'officers', 'odds', 'brand-new', '1961', 'anyway', 'nuclear', 'sub', 'K-19', 'One', 'first', 'nuclear', 'powered', 'submarines', 'carry', 'nuclear-armed', 'ballistic', 'missiles', 'K-19', 'formed', 'nucleus', 'Soviet', 'sea-borne', 'nuclear', 'deterrent', 'Unfortunately', 'rush', 'get', 'sea', 'Soviets', 'make', 'few', 'concessions', 'make', 'actually', 'sea-worthy', 'K-19', 'cranky', 'electronics', 'fail', 'missile-launch', 'drill', 'conducted', 'sub', 'still', 'dry-dock', 'Too', 'principled', 'blame', 'crew', 'equipment', 'malfunctions', 'caused', 'bad', 'Soviet', 'QA', 'Neeson', 'vindictive', 'superiors', 'own', 'name', 'only', 'find', 'been', 'demoted', 'follow', 'orders', 'Captain', 'Vestrikov', 'Ford', 'playing', 'type', 'unfriendly', 'unsympathetic', 'patriotic', 'Soviet', 'tyrant', 'Everything', 'sub', 'rushed', 'first', 'American', 'missile', 'boat', 'real', 'K-19', 'was', 'actually', 'attack', 'sub', 'modified', 'carry', 'few', 'missiles', 'more', 'ominous', 'signs', 'worry', 'crew', 'ship', 'even', 'sailed', 'ship', 'doctor', 'several', 'construction', 'workers', 'have', 'perished', 'freak', 'accidents', 'Nevertheless', 'Ford', 'ship', 'underway', 'crew', 'murderous', 'drills', 'manages', 'launch', 'test', 'missile', 'breaking', 'polar', 'ice.And', 'then', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'wrong', 'reactor', 'When', 'coolant', 'line', 'leaks', 'reactor', 'temperature', 'climb', 'nobody', 'not', 'even', 'rookie', 'reactor', 'officer', 'played', 'Peter', 'Saarsgard', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'temperature', '1,000', 'degrees', 'thermonuclear', 'explosion', 'assumed', 'crew', 'desperately', 'jury-rig', 'piping', 'pump', 'water', 'coolant', 'prolonged', 'exercise', 'workers', 'high-doses', 'radiation', 'toxic', 'ship', 'lack', 'needed', 'supplies', 'are', 'radiation', 'suits', 'aboard', 'so', 'clueless', 'crewmen', 'use', 'chemical-safe', 'suits', 'instead', 'too', 'much', 'free', 'time', 'mutiny', 'Vestrikov', 'who', 'not', 'understand', 'workings', 'ship', 'reactor', 'doggedly', 'assistance', 'nearby', 'Americans', 'Ultimately', 'crew', 'will', 'have', 'come', 'together', 'Vestrikov', 'will', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'be', 'true', 'leader', 'Neeson', 'mold.This', 'was', 'disappointing', 'flick', 'big', 'problem', 'K-19', 'film', 'unconvincingly', 'confusingly', 'interaction', 'sub', 'crew', 'basically', 'bunch', 'angry', 'guys', 'running', 'around', 'submarine', 'set', 'credit', 'K-19', ""n't"", 'try', 'depict', 'sub', 'interior', 'ala', 'Red', 'October', 'darkened', 'interiors', 'lit', 'hi-tech', 'screens', '1961', 'have', 'fairly', 'cramped', 'sub', 'even', 'accident', 'ship', 'already', 'reduced', 'crew', 'being', 'passive', 'captive', 'compliment', 'CGI', 'exterior', 'characters', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'motivations', 'remain', 'opaque', 'Ford', 'character', 'glory', 'seeking', 'politically', 'narrow-minded', 'just', 'very', 'demanding', 'when', 'dangerous', 'surfacing', 'pack', 'ice', 'plot', 'incomprehensible', 'just', 'what', 'are', 'guys', 'expected', 'do', 'Also', 'flick', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'formula', 'foreigners', 'form', 'guys', 'are', 'non-Russian', 'actors', 'using', 'unnecessary', 'Russian', 'accents', 'mannerisms', 'Neeson', 'Slavic', 'grunt', 'when', 'equipment', 'breaks', 'down', 'botched', 'missile', 'drill', 'know', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'Americans', 'ridiculous', 'authentic', 'accents', 'make', 'sound', 'foreigners', 'other', 'turn', 'generic', 'characters', 'fail', 'hide', 'stilted', 'artificial', 'dialog', 'Has', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'seen', 'Amadeus', 'When', 'ditch', 'accents', 'dialog', 'more', 'natural', 'not', 'less', 'authentic', 'Finally', 'flick', 'bad', 'tone', 'when', 'opening', 'Inspired', 'actual', 'events', 'tag', 'just', 'what', 'inspired', 'here', 'what', 'are', 'actual', 'events']",N/A

They are at the top of their form. Ford especially got to show more of his range than usual in this film. The film was not as &quot;gritty&quot; as I would have expected. Life was much worse on these subs than was portrayed. Well portrayed were the quality problems that made life such a struggle for Soviet sailors. An honest, sympathetic approach to life in the Soviet Navy. Not shown, was the fact that Soviet seamen were generally green farm boys with almost no training. The portrayal of the political officer was rather overdone. Overall an excellent film even for those not submarine film buffs. A tense psychological film.

Ford and Neeson are surpringly good, and seem to have a chemistry that is at times perfectly tense. I'd even go so far to say that for the most part, Ford was acting so well I began to hate his character...which of course is his intent. That's saying a lot since I have a hard time buying him as a bad guy (What Lies Beneath was just abysmal). There is, of course, the hullabaloo about the accents. Are they bad? Yes. Ford's is at times too underdone, and at times way over the top. Neeson's is basically absent, and we get more Irish dialect than anything else. I get the feeling they needed a better voice coach...if they even used one. BUT! I found myself getting over it all after about fifteen minutes and following the story instead. It starts slow, but if you hang in there for about a half hour, the tension surfaces, and once it does it rarely lets up. There's genuine emotion and struggle when the reactor springs it leak, and the crew must enter the radiation filled room to fix it. It's just plain depressing and disturbing, and I completely identified wth the blistering men who suffered the effects. I bought Ford's concern over his crew while at the same time struggling with his allegiance to his homeland. I bought Neeson's love for his crew and disgust with Ford's reckless ways.  I routed for the men to escape...Russian men at that, who chose to moon the American Destoryer that was offering them assistance.  Naturally, there are some stretches that make you yawn, and there are some moments where you'll question the  truth of this supposedly True Story.

In this movie, they're portrayed as cowards, mutineers, weepy ninnies and incompetents. This movie was one of the most expensive independent films in history: I'm glad it failed. Historically, it is the sheerest nonsense: most of the events portrayed in this film did not happen, or happened at later or previous dates.As a film, it's done badly. The acting is wooden, the characterization is horrible, the plot is stale and predictable (the actual events were much more complex: some idiot felt a need to modify them to create ... I dunno, some film-school conception of a ""dramatic arc"" I suppose), CGI effects used to make images of the submarine and helicopters: they look like a video game, the musical score also sounds like video game music. From a scientific viewpoint, it's ridiculous: you do not cool a nuclear reactor with a quarter inch diameter steel pipe. Radiation sickness at the levels experienced doesn't make you puke after 10 minutes (though it makes for great dramatic chiaroscuro). I don't know much about submarines, but I'm pretty sure they don't ""dent"" at depth like shown in this movie: they have dual hulls, and only the inner hull would do this (and I think if it did, the boat would sink); if it happened, you wouldn't be able to see it anyway.

(Do look up and read Jeff's entire review.)  Still, it is an extremely interesting look at an incident that actually occurred on Russia's first nuclear-powered submarine.To me, it is interesting that here we have an American film about a wholly Russian submarine crew with Russian equipment and showing the making of Russian heroes.  The reality of the cold war was that both Americans and Russians were constantly spying on and shadowing each other's submarines.In this incident, the only American involvement was an offer for help.  This offer was rejected, by the way.  Try and figure out WHY help from the Americans was rejected.  If the reason was as alluded to in the movie (I won't give it away here), it says a lot about the valor of the boat's captain.This movie does clearly portray the making of heroes.  While a member of the U.S. Air Force, a military history class covered an incident where a young airman in an aircraft threw himself on an incendiary device that lit off and which would have brought the plane and it's crew down.  The man's bravery saved the aircraft and everyone on board at the cost of his own life.  On K-19 you will see many equally brave and heroic men risking their lives for their fellow shipmates.  (And any military member puts their life on the line every time they board a submarine.  Look at how many have sunk whether by act of war or by some mechanical fault.  Yes, statistically it may be far more dangerous crossing a typical city street - but I admire submariners nonetheless!)Something to note before watching the movie - the director Kathryn Bigelow made sure she had not only a Russian on-hand to advise on correctness of submarine details, but the person was actually a former captain of a K-19 class submarine!  No effort was spared in making the interior shots as absolutely accurate as possible.  The extra features section of the DVD shows the various pieces of equipment being made - even down to correct Russian labeling!  What the people acting as crew did on the mocked-up submarine mattered a lot to Kathryn.  You don't see any absent-minded twiddling of dials, etc.  Every action taken in the movie is as would have been done on a real submarine.This movie, I have to say, didn't keep me on the edge of my seat.  It plays out almost in documentary fashion rather than as a movie drama.  But it was nonetheless a very fascinating account of a group of people risking life and limb for fellow man and for country.

Having seen a special that I believe was done by National Geographic, it fell short of my expectations. The trailer for K-19 also gave me false impressions about the movie. I would have liked to give it 3 1/2 stars, but that isn't an option in the form.The special I saw outlined the history of K-19, which is very much like the actual movie. However, the trailer gave me the impression that the move was more action oriented, talking about a missile being fired at a sub and a series of shots that almost make it look like the crew is being left on an iceberg. Neither of those cases happens in the movie, which makes me wonder why the trailer is full of action shots.The movie itself is very realistic; the shots of the sub make you feel, even in the theatre, that you're in this little tin can floating around in the ocean.  They go to crush depth and you see the exterior of the sub buckle under the pressure. The scenes where members of the crew are suffering from radiation sickness can make you cringe; they hold little back.My primary gripe about this film, and why I didn't like it as well as other sub movies, is it's drawn out. The film weighs in at 2 hours, 20 minutes, and I feel 30 minutes of that could have been cut out. The beginning of the film develops why the original captain (Neeson) is not allowed to command the sub, brings on the hard-nosed Captain Vostrikov (Ford), and sets up the idea that K-19 is cursed. After the sub puts out to sea it's an endless string of days where Vostrikov sends the crew through drills. Every time the crew is too slow, or something goes wrong, or someone's injured. Finally the crew does it to his satisfaction and the movie proceeds, but it seems like they're stuck in a ""Groundhog Day""-ish loop.  I suppose it was to get to know the characters better, but it just seemed to lengthen the film, which wasn't really necessary.The movie is gripping, and feels real. There's no sugarcoating in the movie, there's a couple scenes where there's a bit of sentimental feeling, but none of the ""feel good, everything will be okay"" that you often get in movies. It didn't dislike it, but I didn't like it either.

I must have been a submariner in another life :)  In any event, despite not knowing if the portrayal of life on a Soviet submarine is accurate, I liked this interpretation.  The antagonistic relationship between the newly-assigned captain (Harrison Ford) and the crew is very well done.  As is the relationship between that new captain and the old captain.  The ending relationship between them is quite unexpected.While I cannot say that it totally ruined the movie for me, I have to say it was somewhat distracting.  What am I talking about?  The lack of any attempt by Liam Neeson to use a Russian accent.  Everyone else that is portrayed as a Russian has a Russian accent so when you hear Liam speak it sorta takes you out of the movie for a second.The only other problem (if it can be called a problem) is the use of Joss Ackland.  After all this time haven't they found someone else that can play the quintessential Russian?  I'm not saying that Joss does not do an EXCELLENT job portraying a Russian.

600753,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00005JLGJ,Steve Douglas,"[5, 5]","Enough has been said regarding the film's accuracy, summaries of the plot, acting and other diverse opinions so I will only review the actual quality of the transfer of the film to Blu Ray.  I do have the Standard Def version which I have watched several times but this will not be a side by side comparison.  I was going to give the Blu Ray 5 stars but changed my mind to 4 which you will see why a bit later.VIDEO...An excellent video transfer in all ways; they couldn't have improved it.  The transfer is as clean as you could possibly ask for.  My monitor is a Panasonic ZT 65"" and that would make a difference as well but to my viewing the colors are as natural as you can find.  Early in the film the color grading appears to be shot with warmth in mind.  For the rest of the film all colors appear to be as natural as one might actually see.  Colors do not pop as they do in many CGI films and other than a cool color grading in the reactor room, all other colors are very realistic.  At no point did I see any video artifacts or aliasing, no ghosting or stair stepping.  Mbps rate was one of the highest I have seen on a Blu Ray and seemed to average at around 41Mbps.  At no point did I see it drop below the high 20's.  As far as video transfers go, despite the letterboxing on top and bottom of your screen,  I give this film 5 stars.AUDIO...Thank god we get a lossless audio codec in Dolby Digital HD 5.1.  There is an excellent spread of audio across the front stage with frequent use of discreet channeling to the front left and right surrounds, especially when the submarine is actually under water.  The rear surrounds (I run a 7.1 system) do receive a good amount of work to do as well but not a whole lot of discreet channeling to them when, in a sub, there should be audio all over the place and almost all of it being discreet.  When compared to the majority of films, the audio for K-19 would rightly deserve 5 stars BUT when I compare this film's audio to the audio in two other great submarine movies, 'Das Boot' and 'U-571', both on Blu Ray, the audio of K-19 doesn't come close.  The audio on both of those films is superlative.  This might not be the fairest of comparisons but I lowered the 5 star audio of K-19 just because it didn't come close to that of the two mentioned films.

Amazon did a fine job with it's review that explains the basics of the story well enough, so I don't feel the necessity of repeating the plot here. I'll just stick to what I liked and disliked about the film within this review.There is plenty to like about this well-made and well-acted ""sub"" genre.  Harrison Ford give a compelling performance although it is hampered a bit by his ill-attempt at a Russian accent.  This film, however, doesn't really belong to Ford, but to his co-star Liam Neeson,Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition),The Haunting,Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition), who steal just about any movie he is in.The director, the very underrated and versatile Kathryn Bigelow whose credits include the crime dramaBlue Steel (1990)with Jamie Lee Curtis, the bizarre sci-fi filmStrange Dayswith Ralph Fiennes, and the small classic thrillerNear Dark (2pc) (Ws Spec)with Bill Paxton, Adrian Pasdar, and Lance Hendrikson, is confident and uncompromising.This film failed to find an audience upon its release and I think that was more an issue of this film being about a RUSSIAN sub and for the most part, we didn't and don't care about them and their Cold War efforts no matter how compelling the story is or how well-acted.  In addition, this film was released during the summer blockbuster time of year and was just kind of lost in the shuffle wherein lighter or more exciting films made more of splash at the box-office than this heavier film which would have done better in the fall or winter months.Regardless of why this film failed to find an audience upon its release, it is a top-notch thriller that is executed very well and has a very compelling storyline no matter what country one comes from.",4,"Not Quite Das Boot or U-571, But Intense and Well-Acted Nevertheless",1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,1957,"['reading', 'Jenny', 'J.J.I', 'review', 'ofDas', 'Boot', 'Director', 'Cut', 'very', 'nice', 'reviewer', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'promoting', 'here', 'was', 'reminded', 'film', 'watched', 'withU-571', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'weekend', 'family', 'Amazon', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'review', 'basics', 'story', 'well', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'necessity', 'repeating', 'plot', 'here', ""'ll"", 'just', 'stick', 'what', 'liked', 'disliked', 'film', 'review.There', 'plenty', 'like', 'well-made', 'well-acted', 'sub', 'genre', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'give', 'compelling', 'performance', 'hampered', 'bit', 'ill-attempt', 'Russian', 'accent', 'film', 'however', ""n't"", 'really', 'belong', 'Ford', 'co-star', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Haunting', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'who', 'steal', 'just', 'movie', 'in.The', 'director', 'very', 'underrated', 'versatile', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'credits', 'include', 'crime', 'dramaBlue', 'Steel', '1990', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'bizarre', 'sci-fi', 'filmStrange', 'Dayswith', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'small', 'classic', 'thrillerNear', 'Dark', '2pc', 'Ws', 'Spec', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Adrian', 'Pasdar', 'Lance', 'Hendrikson', 'confident', 'uncompromising.This', 'film', 'failed', 'find', 'audience', 'upon', 'release', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'issue', 'film', 'being', 'RUSSIAN', 'sub', 'most', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Cold', 'War', 'efforts', 'matter', 'how', 'compelling', 'story', 'how', 'well-acted', 'addition', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'time', 'year', 'was', 'just', 'kind', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'wherein', 'lighter', 'more', 'exciting', 'films', 'made', 'more', 'splash', 'box-office', 'heavier', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'fall', 'winter', 'months.Regardless', 'why', 'film', 'failed', 'find', 'audience', 'upon', 'release', 'top-notch', 'thriller', 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'matter', 'what', 'country', 'one']",N/A
600756,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005JLGJ,Steven Reynolds,"[5, 13]","I thought Harrison Ford would be this film's undoing, but in the end he's the best thing about it. He becomes more convincing as the film progresses, and by the end you can almost believe in him. The problem here is the story. As historical fact it's an intriguing, sobering and sometimes sickening tale of Communist pride defeating common sense, and it might have worked as a documentary. But as a dramatic story, at least as imagined by Louis Nowra and Christopher Kyle, it's unrelentingly boring. The problem isn't so much that a film telling the true story of a nuclear disaster that was narrowly averted won't play because we already know how it ends. ""Thirteen Days"" made an admirable tilt at the Cuban missile crisis, and it worked because it told the story from a new perspective: it took us inside the White House, inside the Kennedys, and in that sense gave us the never-before-seen. But ""K-19"" fails to give us anything new. We've seen it all before: the ruthless commander, the imminent mutiny, the fire in the hold, and the threat of nuclear holocaust... these have been such regular features of big submarine movies of the last twenty years such as  ""Das Boot"", ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"" and ""U-571"", that they're all but genre clich&eacute;s. Life on a Russian sub looks pretty much like life on an American one, only slower and with a less happy ending. The truly interesting material - the psychology of Russian national pride - is blown. When the key moments come, they're consistently sunk by impenetrable speeches about heroics and the Motherland, set to the doleful tones of Klaus Badelt's tedious score. We learn very little from this film, nor are we entertained. Bigelow is a fine action director, and she shows her skill in the scant opportunities the script gives her.

But in all, there is not a lot to complain about.  I especially approved of Harrison Ford playing ""out of type"".  The fact that he is not a likeable character for the first 80% of the film accentuates the drama of a boatload of Russian sailors trapped inside a timebomb of a submarine, with leaking nuclear reactor.What I struggled with, and this is a small quibble, is whether Vadim -- the untested replacement for the sacked reactor officer -- could stand up to the 18+ minutes he spent trying to repair the jury-rigged coolant pipe weld, when the other sailors came out fried and puking their guts out after 10 minutes.Finally, while I think this ""expose"" of a cold war tragedy makes for good cinema, I doubt seriously whether the story as told is what really happened.

600758,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B00005JLGJ,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[0, 0]","What started off as Project 658. became the K19 Soviet (Hotel I Cass) Ballistic Missile Sub.  K-19: The Widowmaker [Blu-ray] is a first rate DVD movie and blu-ray just makes the visual and sound quality that much better. There are scenes of gore during which the men are exposed to very high levels of radation after the reactor literally loses its cool. Radiation sickness is shown at its worst with a moderate amount of graphic detail left intact. For the men sent into the Reactor room death came to all of them in about three months time. 15 more men died in the next two years due to radiation exposure. Even after the K19 redesigns even in the west Soviet nuclear safety was more joke than reality. Decisions were made that would be unthinkable in US nuclear subs.  Unfortunately there was a ""Cold War"" on and the Soviet Union had to find a way to beef up its nuclear deterant. The USSR  had formidable land based ICBM nukes that were the backbone of the soviet threat but they were increasingly vulnerable.  In 1961 the big slow moving prop driven Russian &#1058;&#1091;&#1087;&#1086;&#1083;&#1077;&#1074; &#1058;&#1091;-95 or TU-142 Russian Bear Bombers were effective but no real immediate threat to US interests if launched from a distance. So the former Soviet Union did what it always did when put between a rock and a hard place militarily.  The soviets sacrficed safety and hurries a weapons system to ""Readiness"" in this case it was the K-19 first in a long line of Soviet ballistic missile Hotel Class subs. The sailors who manned her were expected to suffer any hardship for the sake of the motherland which this movie illustrates in unflinching detail.This K-19: The Widowmaker DVD movie on its face appears shocking, evil and foolish to 2014 western sensibilities which is why in my review I provided a little background so you can watch this movie in its historical context.  The Soviet Union was a strong advisary indeed.  The former Soviet Union had a formidable, credible nuclear deterent even in 1961.  The Soviet Union shocked the United States with its launch of Yuri Gagarin into space because; it also signalled they had very advanced if basic rocket sciences. Advanced rockets with huge lift capacity meant they could hurl huge nuclear weapons at communism's enemies in the west.  The United States is often a sleeping giant that once roused from its slumber is very effective at building the infrastructure needed to defend itself.  The USA not only eliminated the nuclear missile gap we developed the nuclear triad of land based sub based and air based delivery systems.  Now the Soviets were shocked and honestly frightened they had to answer what they saw as the new threat. K19 was the answer.  A sub rushed into development, rushed into service with two presurized water nuclear reactors favored for their small size and huge power outputs.  Neither of the K19's reactors was protected by even the most basic safety backups.  So when disaster happened and the cooling system failed we had a disaster of epic scope that is the basis of this K-19: The Widowmaker [Blu-ray] DVD.Communism was the religion of the former Soviet state and any sacrifice made on the alter of communism was not only good but expected of all its adherents.  This movie reveals so pretty shocking stuff about the lengths the former Soviet Union went to keep this sub and its secrets.  What I found equally shocking is some of what happened after the story told by K-19: The Widowmaker.  The K19 post accident was nicknamed after the first Japanese city bombed by the USA in its hope to end World War Two with less bloodshed. Shocking is the K19 instead of being immediately scraped was indeed retrofitted and put back into service.  Equally shocking is the K19 a sub where so many men died was kept in service till it was finally decomissioned in the early 1990's.  When I watch K-19: The Widowmaker I realize that despite all the faults and flaws in our United States government, I am blessed to have been born here.  When I think of those poor men scacrified on the alter of communism in such a brutish way, I am shocked and saddened most profoundly.  K-19: The Widowmaker Blue Ray is an awesome DVD movie because; with few exceptions it follows pretty true to history.  K-19: The Widowmaker is entertaining while also informative.  this is NOT a dry documentary it presents the saliors of the K19 as living people who were but for their form of government just like us.  On the level of the pure inhumanity of what happened on the K19 my heart cried right along with the sailors who lost their friends.  This was a very moving portrayal told with great sensitivity.  This movie was not a box office success taking in far less in box office than it cost to make.  Hopefully the DVD sales will help  K-19: The Widowmaker break even because; this was a story that so totally had to be shared with the world so those sailors did not die in vain.",5,THIS K-19: The

600759,AS5WZV6SBZAAK,B00005JLGJ,The Blue Raja,"[22, 22]","After scanning some reviews I've decided to add my 2 cents, since I just got the DVD & saw the movie for the first time.  To those who say it has very similar elements already visited in films such as ""Crimson Tide,"" ""U-571"", etc., my reaction to that is, yes, you're right.  The first half hour of this movie I was a bit concerned about where it was going.  It had the ""been here, done that"" feel to it in regards to other ""sub movies."" I didn't buy Ford's accent at first (why? Because I know him from other movies, whereas if some unknown actor played the role, I wouldn't have questioned the authenticity or even the accent delivery at all), but as time passed, I didn't notice it as much and thought it was fine.  In regards to the why do Americans put accents on in the first place when speaking English, it's really no big mystery, it simply adds to the setting.  I suppose if you went the other extreme and gave them all harsh U.S. Southern accents, it would pull you even further away from believing in who they are portraying, so it's just like an extra prop that enhances the presentation.To those historic critics who try to rip up every attempt Hollywood makes to tell a story, I have this to say: Sad as it may be, but if I had not seen ""Schindler's List,"" I would not have as much an appreciation for the Holocaust.  I don't read much history, so if Hollywood with it's jaded glitz & glamour can emotionally move me to appreciate a moment of history, then so be it!  And speaking of important moment's of history, you should check out ""Uprising,"" another great historic drama that deserves attention (about the Jewish ghetto uprising).At any rate, now for why I give K-19 five stars.  I enjoyed the drama, the tension, the cast, and the story.  It's that simple.  I still think ""U-571"" is the best sub movie I've ever seen, perhaps because of how tightly the movie went with not a second of downtime, but K-19 is a more human, dramatic story that is important to see.  The DVD has several documentaries on how they made the movie that should be seen by the history critics, as it certainly seems like they did much research on the topics & history before shooting the film.  If the director had a gap, then it needed to be filled, and a story has to be interesting or it becomes a bad movie.  Never will everyone be happy, and that's why most reviews will differ.  So take it from a person who watches movies to be entertained, moved, and even educated at times, K-19 is an excellent movie.",5,"A dramatic tale of an important, hidden chapter of history",1039564800,"12 11, 2002",2002,2505,"['scanning', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'add', '2', 'cents', 'just', 'got', 'DVD', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'who', 'say', 'very', 'similar', 'elements', 'already', 'visited', 'films', 'such', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'U-571', 'etc.', 'reaction', 'yes', ""'re"", 'right', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'concerned', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'had', 'been', 'here', 'done', 'feel', 'regards', 'other', 'sub', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Ford', 'accent', 'first', 'why', 'know', 'other', 'movies', 'whereas', 'unknown', 'actor', 'played', 'role', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'questioned', 'authenticity', 'even', 'accent', 'delivery', 'time', 'passed', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'fine', 'regards', 'why', 'do', 'Americans', 'put', 'accents', 'first', 'place', 'when', 'speaking', 'English', 'really', 'big', 'mystery', 'simply', 'setting', 'suppose', 'went', 'other', 'extreme', 'gave', 'harsh', 'U.S.', 'Southern', 'accents', 'would', 'pull', 'even', 'further', 'away', 'believing', 'who', 'are', 'portraying', 'just', 'extra', 'prop', 'presentation.To', 'historic', 'critics', 'who', 'try', 'rip', 'up', 'attempt', 'Hollywood', 'tell', 'story', 'have', 'say', 'Sad', 'may', 'be', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Schindler', 'List', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'appreciation', 'Holocaust', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'much', 'history', 'so', 'Hollywood', 'jaded', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'can', 'emotionally', 'move', 'appreciate', 'moment', 'history', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'speaking', 'important', 'moment', 'history', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'Uprising', 'great', 'historic', 'drama', 'attention', 'Jewish', 'ghetto', 'uprising', 'rate', 'now', 'why', 'give', 'K-19', 'five', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'drama', 'tension', 'cast', 'story', 'simple', 'still', 'think', 'U-571', 'best', 'sub', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'perhaps', 'how', 'tightly', 'movie', 'went', 'not', 'second', 'downtime', 'K-19', 'more', 'human', 'dramatic', 'story', 'important', 'see', 'DVD', 'several', 'documentaries', 'how', 'made', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'history', 'critics', 'certainly', 'did', 'much', 'research', 'topics', 'history', 'shooting', 'film', 'director', 'had', 'gap', 'then', 'needed', 'be', 'filled', 'story', 'be', 'interesting', 'bad', 'movie', 'Never', 'will', 'everyone', 'be', 'happy', 'why', 'most', 'reviews', 'will', 'differ', 'So', 'take', 'person', 'who', 'movies', 'be', 'entertained', 'moved', 'even', 'educated', 'times', 'K-19', 'excellent', 'movie']",N/A

600763,A9U5CELFTZ4U8,B00005JLGJ,"T. J. Bacon ""TJB""","[4, 4]","In BriefBased on the events of a true story, the film explores the emotional drama that unfolds around Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) who in 1961, at the height of the Cold War, is ordered to take command of the nuclear missile submarine K-19 from its original commander Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson).  The Soviet's first nuclear submarine, the K-19 is an ill-prepared beast, and Vostrikov must quickly ready her for her maiden voyage &amp; test fire a missile no matter what the cost may be.ReviewNicknamed the Widowmaker during its outfit and construction after the death of several workers involved with K-19, it was always felt to be a cursed boat and the events as retold here seem to confirm this.  It was only after the collapse of the Soviet Union that this story could be told - and the emotional drama is extreme and worthwhile.  Both Neeson and Ford are brilliant in their portrayals of the Captains at loggerheads; submerged in not only a crate with a nuclear reactor pasted into it but also a political exercise where the schedule takes priority over the needs of reality.While noted director Kathryn Bigelow is capable of delivering on the action, as she has proven in the past with films such as Near Dark, Strange Days or Point Break, her films always manage to stand out from the run of the mill action genre fare.  One could argue that it is her innate ability to deliver believable characters, allowing even the darkest or toughest of them to show their bare belly of motivating emotion to an audience, that makes her work stand out from the rest.  K-19 is no different, as the parallel opposites in command show us: the two Captains, Ford ruling with a rod of iron, Neeson the velvet glove.  Both appear to be the opposites of the other, yet both serve their motherland putting the brotherhood of the Union before all else, and if anything are merely symbolic of the two sides of one ruler.This use of binary opposites runs as a theme throughout the film and is most notably picked up in the lighting and camerawork by the director of photography, Jeff Cronenweth whose previous work included the stunning Fight Club. Here one can't help but notice the polish of the nuclear reactor, isolated in its chamber of bright fluorescent light, incongruous to its outer confines of the old style shell of a submarine with its analogue dials &amp; switches bathed in a hue of bronze old sticky light.  Indeed throughout the course of the film there is a pleasing combination of CGI camera movements through the hull of the boat to steady cam shots within, thus displaying the grandeur of such a `modern' machine.  While later as the mood of the film takes a turn for the worse this is reinforced with frantic handheld camera work and the use of a shallow depth of field that has been present in many of the shots through the entire film becomes more apparent and indeed poignant highlighting the claustrophobia and panic that ensues.The only minor annoyance that I had with the film was the particularly bad Russian accents used by some of the actors.  At times it felt more like a ""wessal"" full of Chekhov's from Star Trek worrying about the ""noo-clear ree-ac-tor and mee-siles.""  That said the performances by the supporting cast are among some of the best I have seen in a film this year and it is only the believability of their work that elevated the tension and interaction between both Ford and Neeson - who ultimately hold the film together.The VerdictThe sheer horror and ultimately the gratification of this film comes from the reality that is communicated so well.  The build up within the narrative is not wasted and a link between the crew and audience is established well.  You feel that you have gotten to know these men that are suffering, yet the story is not about them but rather the two central figures.  And while both are played well this shift of focus to the chain of command makes one feel that there are other stories within the boat that are merely hinted at and are somewhat lost.  Its strength comes from the fact that this happened but like all dramatisations this too is its weakness for one cannot help but think to what degree a certain amount of embellishment has taken place.  Ultimately this is the story of two Captains and their men, not the other way around, and on that level it works so well it should not be missed.",3,ROUGH RUSSIAN WRECK,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,4386,"['BriefBased', 'events', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'emotional', 'drama', 'around', 'Captain', 'Alexei', 'Vostrikov', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'who', '1961', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'ordered', 'take', 'command', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'submarine', 'K-19', 'original', 'commander', 'Captain', 'Mikhail', 'Polenin', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Soviet', 'first', 'nuclear', 'submarine', 'K-19', 'ill-prepared', 'beast', 'Vostrikov', 'must', 'quickly', 'ready', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'amp', 'test', 'fire', 'missile', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'may', 'be.ReviewNicknamed', 'Widowmaker', 'outfit', 'construction', 'death', 'several', 'workers', 'involved', 'K-19', 'was', 'always', 'felt', 'be', 'cursed', 'boat', 'events', 'retold', 'here', 'seem', 'confirm', 'was', 'only', 'collapse', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'told', 'emotional', 'drama', 'extreme', 'worthwhile', 'Neeson', 'Ford', 'are', 'brilliant', 'portrayals', 'Captains', 'loggerheads', 'submerged', 'not', 'only', 'crate', 'nuclear', 'reactor', 'pasted', 'also', 'political', 'exercise', 'where', 'schedule', 'priority', 'needs', 'reality.While', 'noted', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'capable', 'delivering', 'action', 'proven', 'past', 'films', 'such', 'Near', 'Dark', 'Strange', 'Days', 'Point', 'Break', 'films', 'always', 'manage', 'stand', 'out', 'run', 'mill', 'action', 'genre', 'fare', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'innate', 'ability', 'deliver', 'believable', 'characters', 'allowing', 'even', 'darkest', 'toughest', 'show', 'bare', 'belly', 'motivating', 'emotion', 'audience', 'work', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'K-19', 'different', 'parallel', 'opposites', 'command', 'show', 'two', 'Captains', 'Ford', 'ruling', 'rod', 'iron', 'Neeson', 'velvet', 'glove', 'appear', 'be', 'opposites', 'other', 'yet', 'serve', 'motherland', 'putting', 'brotherhood', 'Union', 'else', 'anything', 'are', 'merely', 'symbolic', 'two', 'sides', 'one', 'ruler.This', 'use', 'binary', 'opposites', 'theme', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'picked', 'up', 'lighting', 'camerawork', 'director', 'photography', 'Jeff', 'Cronenweth', 'previous', 'work', 'included', 'stunning', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Here', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'polish', 'nuclear', 'reactor', 'isolated', 'chamber', 'bright', 'fluorescent', 'light', 'incongruous', 'outer', 'confines', 'old', 'style', 'shell', 'submarine', 'analogue', 'dials', 'amp', 'switches', 'bathed', 'hue', 'bronze', 'old', 'sticky', 'light', 'Indeed', 'course', 'film', 'pleasing', 'combination', 'CGI', 'camera', 'movements', 'hull', 'boat', 'steady', 'cam', 'shots', 'thus', 'displaying', 'grandeur', 'such', 'modern', 'machine', 'later', 'mood', 'film', 'turn', 'worse', 'reinforced', 'frantic', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'use', 'shallow', 'depth', 'field', 'been', 'present', 'many', 'shots', 'entire', 'film', 'more', 'apparent', 'indeed', 'poignant', 'highlighting', 'claustrophobia', 'panic', 'only', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'particularly', 'bad', 'Russian', 'accents', 'used', 'actors', 'times', 'felt', 'more', 'wessal', 'full', 'Chekhov', 'Star', 'Trek', 'worrying', 'noo-clear', 'ree-ac-tor', 'mee-siles', 'said', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'year', 'only', 'believability', 'work', 'elevated', 'tension', 'interaction', 'Ford', 'Neeson', 'who', 'ultimately', 'hold', 'film', 'together.The', 'VerdictThe', 'sheer', 'horror', 'ultimately', 'gratification', 'film', 'reality', 'communicated', 'so', 'well', 'build', 'up', 'narrative', 'not', 'wasted', 'link', 'crew', 'audience', 'established', 'well', 'feel', 'have', 'gotten', 'know', 'men', 'are', 'suffering', 'yet', 'story', 'not', 'rather', 'two', 'central', 'figures', 'are', 'played', 'well', 'shift', 'focus', 'chain', 'command', 'one', 'feel', 'are', 'other', 'stories', 'boat', 'are', 'merely', 'hinted', 'are', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'strength', 'fact', 'happened', 'dramatisations', 'too', 'weakness', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'what', 'degree', 'certain', 'amount', 'embellishment', 'taken', 'place', 'Ultimately', 'story', 'two', 'Captains', 'men', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'level', 'so', 'well', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A
600764,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,B00005JLGJ,T.M. Reader,"[3, 3]","Firstly, there several are excellent exhaustive reveiews on this wonderful film (Chapulina R did a particularly good job).  Read a few of them.  My review comments are related to a relevant technical aspect ---Hollywood NEVER gets it right on things ""nuclear"", usually muddling comparison and contrast between weapons and power production plants.  A loss of coolant (heat sink) to a nuclear powered ship's reactor at sea will NOT give rise to a sustained nuclear chain reaction and absolutely not one that would also involve the weapons aboard . . . even on the shoddily designed/built early Russian boats. It is likely the core would indeed experience some melting (localized or homgenous) and theoretically could eventually melt through the hull of the ship . . . at which point the Atlantic Ocean would provide a superb heat sink.Other than local bottom feeding sea life, the real threat to anyone other than the crew of a ship at sea is not really mathematically significant.  The threat to the crew, however, in a situation as depicted in the film is huge.  For the incident as depicted on ""K-19"", I'm surprised that anyone aboard lived to reach old age.  Great peril and heroism were involved.  But excessive radiation exposure often involves a slowly developing and non-spectacular demise so, as usual, Hollywood caved in in favor of the ""mushroom cloud over the Eastern Seaboard"" scenario.  A shame.I believe that challenge for the Captain involved two issues:  1. Saving the lives of his crew from the accumulating radioactive contamination (not an explosion), and  2. Not allowing his ship to fall into American hands.  Mammoth tasks under the circumstances in the story.Overall, a great submarine flick however.  Other than these nuclear issues, there is very little submarine technical baggage to keep up with.  Much of the film's tension involves the human aspect.A very nicely done, high dollar production and is great entertainment.",5,My 2 cents . . .,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,1947,"['Firstly', 'several', 'are', 'excellent', 'exhaustive', 'reveiews', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Chapulina', 'R', 'did', 'particularly', 'good', 'job', 'Read', 'few', 'review', 'comments', 'are', 'related', 'relevant', 'technical', 'aspect', '-Hollywood', 'NEVER', 'right', 'things', 'nuclear', 'usually', 'muddling', 'comparison', 'contrast', 'weapons', 'power', 'production', 'plants', 'loss', 'coolant', 'heat', 'sink', 'nuclear', 'powered', 'ship', 'reactor', 'sea', 'will', 'NOT', 'give', 'rise', 'sustained', 'nuclear', 'chain', 'reaction', 'absolutely', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'also', 'involve', 'weapons', 'even', 'shoddily', 'early', 'Russian', 'boats', 'likely', 'core', 'would', 'indeed', 'experience', 'melting', 'localized', 'homgenous', 'theoretically', 'could', 'eventually', 'melt', 'hull', 'ship', 'point', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'would', 'provide', 'superb', 'heat', 'sink.Other', 'local', 'bottom', 'feeding', 'sea', 'life', 'real', 'threat', 'anyone', 'other', 'crew', 'ship', 'sea', 'not', 'really', 'mathematically', 'significant', 'threat', 'crew', 'however', 'situation', 'depicted', 'film', 'huge', 'incident', 'depicted', 'K-19', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'anyone', 'aboard', 'lived', 'reach', 'old', 'age', 'Great', 'peril', 'heroism', 'were', 'involved', 'excessive', 'radiation', 'exposure', 'often', 'slowly', 'developing', 'non-spectacular', 'demise', 'so', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'caved', 'favor', 'mushroom', 'cloud', 'Eastern', 'Seaboard', 'scenario', 'shame.I', 'believe', 'challenge', 'Captain', 'involved', 'two', 'issues', '1', 'Saving', 'lives', 'crew', 'accumulating', 'radioactive', 'contamination', 'not', 'explosion', '2', 'Not', 'allowing', 'ship', 'fall', 'American', 'hands', 'Mammoth', 'tasks', 'circumstances', 'story.Overall', 'great', 'submarine', 'flick', 'however', 'Other', 'nuclear', 'issues', 'very', 'little', 'submarine', 'technical', 'baggage', 'keep', 'up', 'Much', 'film', 'tension', 'human', 'aspect.A', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'high', 'dollar', 'production', 'great', 'entertainment']",N/A

600766,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JLGJ,trebe,"[1, 2]","Supposedly based on actual events suppressed for decades, K-19: The Widowmaker (2002) tells the story of a nuclear incident aboard a Russian submarine, on a mission in the North Atlantic.  The time is 1961, John F. Kennedy is president, and cold war tensions are at a high level.  Peace between the superpowers is maintained by the policy of mutually assured destruction (MAD), where neither nation would dare to use a nuclear weapon, for fear that the other would do the same.  A part of the balance of power, are submarine launched nuclear missiles.Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones, Star Wars) is Captain Alexei Vostrikov, newly appointed captain of the K-19, the Soviet Union's newest super sub.  He is replacing Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson), who has come into disfavor with Moscow.  For the sub's maiden voyage, Moscow directs Polenin to take K-19 into the north Atlantic, cruise under the ice cap, and test launch a missile, thus demonstrating to the Americans, Russia ability to strike the US from a submarine.Setting to sea, things are a little rough, as Vostrikov puts the crew through drill after drill.  He then tests the limits of the craft, taking it down to crush depth, then making a rapid ascent.  Crashing through the ice cap, he then fires the test missile.  Their mission successfully completed, Moscow directs the sub to begin patrolling off the eastern shore of the United States.On the way to America, one of the nuclear reactors begins to overheat.  Atomic power being a relatively new technology, Captain Vostrikov is in a tough spot, as he must rely on a reactor officer, just out of the training academy.  The ship has only a few hours, before the core becomes critical, and detonates.  A desperate plan, to reroute the ship's water supply to cool the core is attempted.  The modifications are successful, but the workers are exposed to potentially lethal doses of radiation.The immediate threat has been averted, but those aboard are being subjected to high doses of radiation.  Refusing to accept help from a nearby American ship, Vostrikov's plan is to try and limp back to Russia.  When the makeshift cooling system fails, rather than risk a nuclear explosion, the crew decides to submerge and try to make additional repairs.Academy Award winning director Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker, Point Break), was dedicated to telling the story of these forgotten men, in as realistic way as possible.  The film does capture some of the atmosphere of the conditions on a Russian sub, as well as the spirit and attitude of the officers and crew.  K-19 is essentially a drama about overcoming a disaster, those looking for an action film, may be quite disappointed.  Although the story has historical significance, until the nuclear crisis, things move a bit slow, and the clash between captains Vostrikov and Polenin, is about the only thing for the audience to focus on.  While there is some interest in watching superstars Ford and Neeson clash swords, it really does not make for the most exciting or compelling viewing.  Based on this, while the filmmaker's motives are certainly laudable, and the film is a first class production, its lack of commercial success, is not particularly surprising.",3,"historically significant perhaps, but may lack mass appeal . . .",1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,3226,"['Supposedly', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'suppressed', 'decades', 'K-19', 'Widowmaker', '2002', 'story', 'nuclear', 'incident', 'Russian', 'submarine', 'mission', 'North', 'Atlantic', 'time', '1961', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'president', 'cold', 'war', 'tensions', 'are', 'high', 'level', 'Peace', 'superpowers', 'maintained', 'policy', 'mutually', 'assured', 'destruction', 'MAD', 'where', 'nation', 'would', 'dare', 'use', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'fear', 'other', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'part', 'balance', 'power', 'are', 'submarine', 'launched', 'nuclear', 'missiles.Harrison', 'Ford', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Captain', 'Alexei', 'Vostrikov', 'newly', 'appointed', 'captain', 'K-19', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'newest', 'super', 'sub', 'replacing', 'Captain', 'Mikhail', 'Polenin', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'come', 'disfavor', 'Moscow', 'sub', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'Moscow', 'Polenin', 'take', 'K-19', 'north', 'Atlantic', 'cruise', 'ice', 'cap', 'test', 'launch', 'missile', 'thus', 'demonstrating', 'Americans', 'Russia', 'ability', 'strike', 'US', 'submarine.Setting', 'sea', 'things', 'are', 'little', 'rough', 'Vostrikov', 'crew', 'drill', 'drill', 'then', 'limits', 'craft', 'taking', 'down', 'crush', 'depth', 'then', 'making', 'rapid', 'ascent', 'Crashing', 'ice', 'cap', 'then', 'test', 'missile', 'mission', 'successfully', 'completed', 'Moscow', 'sub', 'begin', 'patrolling', 'off', 'eastern', 'shore', 'United', 'States.On', 'way', 'America', 'one', 'nuclear', 'reactors', 'overheat', 'Atomic', 'power', 'being', 'relatively', 'new', 'technology', 'Captain', 'Vostrikov', 'tough', 'spot', 'must', 'rely', 'reactor', 'officer', 'just', 'training', 'academy', 'ship', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'core', 'critical', 'detonates', 'desperate', 'plan', 'reroute', 'ship', 'water', 'supply', 'cool', 'core', 'attempted', 'modifications', 'are', 'successful', 'workers', 'are', 'exposed', 'potentially', 'lethal', 'doses', 'radiation.The', 'immediate', 'threat', 'been', 'averted', 'aboard', 'are', 'being', 'subjected', 'high', 'doses', 'radiation', 'Refusing', 'accept', 'help', 'nearby', 'American', 'ship', 'Vostrikov', 'plan', 'try', 'limp', 'back', 'Russia', 'When', 'makeshift', 'cooling', 'system', 'rather', 'risk', 'nuclear', 'explosion', 'crew', 'submerge', 'try', 'make', 'additional', 'repairs.Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Point', 'Break', 'was', 'dedicated', 'telling', 'story', 'forgotten', 'men', 'realistic', 'way', 'possible', 'film', 'capture', 'atmosphere', 'conditions', 'Russian', 'sub', 'as', 'well', 'spirit', 'attitude', 'officers', 'crew', 'K-19', 'essentially', 'drama', 'overcoming', 'disaster', 'looking', 'action', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'story', 'historical', 'significance', 'nuclear', 'crisis', 'things', 'move', 'bit', 'slow', 'clash', 'captains', 'Vostrikov', 'Polenin', 'only', 'thing', 'audience', 'focus', 'interest', 'watching', 'superstars', 'Ford', 'Neeson', 'clash', 'swords', 'really', 'not', 'make', 'most', 'exciting', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'Based', 'filmmaker', 'motives', 'are', 'certainly', 'laudable', 'film', 'first', 'class', 'production', 'lack', 'commercial', 'success', 'not', 'particularly', 'surprising']",N/A

His ship ""K-19"" is given a mission to launch a test missile from the sea, in order to show the US government that Soviet Unions could afford a means to attack the mainland of the United States.  But before ""K-19"" goes on its first voyage, it has already witnessed many deaths of workers during its  construction: hence, its nickname ""Widowmaker.""Based on the historical facts that have been recently revealed, ""K-19"" has everything that any movie producers would vie for.  It has elements for making very dramatic moments, authentic historical background, advanced visual techniques of the 21st century, and the stars: Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson.  But the result is not totally successful, though the film deserves kinder attention from the audience, who seemed to steer away from the theaters.All right.  Let us be honest.  The events shown here are often too incredible, reminding us of the moments we have seen in the similar films set in submarines.  Also, the film is often very painful to watch.  Not that the film is bad; it is too realistic for some of us.  Remember, K-19 is one of the earliest nuclear submarine, and its reactor was not 100 % safe.  At one scene, members risk their life to save the ship (and possibly, according to the film, save the day), but the description is hauntingly real.  But we have seen desasterous nuclear accidents in the past, and the film is only paying due attention to the fact.  However, if you think ""K-19"" is our usual summer blockbuster movie, you are utterly wrong.  There are some actions, but they are not sort of actions you see in ""Crimson Tide or ""Red October.""And fans of Harrison Ford, please beware.  His acting as a rigid Russian Captain is nearly as good as Gene Hackman's.  But you cannot expect Han Solo or Indie Jones here; clearly Mr. Ford is thinking of changing his image in the past, going towards a newer direction.  Whether you like it or not, I don't know.Liam Neeson is of course fantastic as a more compassionate officier Mikhail Polenin, but it is regreattable that the film seems to handle other younger cast with colorless touch.  Sometimes you cannot tell one young actor from another (well, I thought so), and while director Kathryn Biglow meticulously pays attention to the particular items of the inside of the submarine, she failed to bring a vivid picture of the people who were trapped in this doomed ship: those people who should be described with more detailed script.The film is not a failure.  It only lacks something that made ""Das Boot"" and other submarine films a classic.  When the director let the actors do their jobs, the film is fine; however, when Ms. Bigelow gives a superflous accent to some aspects of the film -- like heroism -- the film stops its movement, blowing up with obvious messages.  I know those crew are heroes.  Their final judgement is a sufficient proof.  But the director tries to show that with obtrucive soundtracks and slightly exaggerated cameras.  So, you have to listen to the bells, choirs, and brass when more understated handling is much more  suitable to this serious subject matter.If you have seen Bigelow's previous works, these flaws could be all predicted -- from ""Near Dark"" ""Strange Days"" to ""Weight of the Water.""  They are all visually stunning, but damaged by not-so-good narrative structure, to take it seriously (see how decetives in ""Point Break"" starring young Kianu Reeves, and you'll understand.  Oh, and that mark on the ...).  In ""K-19"" she showed her best shot.

The Russian submarine K19, stocked with nuclear missiles, is about to embark upon its maiden mission: to scare the US by test-firing one of the missiles in the North Atlantic. The mission is complicated by the military's rushed schedule and the K19 is scheduled to sail in less-than-perfect operating condition. Harrison Ford is the star and executive producer in this edge-of-your-seat film. Both Ford and Liam Neeson star as Soviet Navy Captains. Ford relieves Neeson at the helm and the two butt heads, challenging each other for command. Ford drills the crew obsessively to prepare them for potential crisis. Like APOLLO 13, this mission was cursed from the beginning. Ten men were killed before the K19 had even left port. The nickname ""Widowmaker"" was established before its maiden voyage. After they set sail, everything goes wrong. The nuclear reactor cooling system sprung a leak, threatening to raise the core temperature to 1,000 degrees. This would detonate the nuclear weapons, starting a chain reaction leading to WWIII. The crewmen must go on a suicide rescue mission into the core and repair the leak, exposing themselves to massive doses of radiation.Directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Pointe Break and Strange Days), ""K19"" was inspired by a real-life Cold War incident. The actual crew was sworn to secrecy for 28 years. In 1989, with the fall of communism, the crew of the K19 were finally able to discuss the events of their mission and put it to rest.Prior to seeing this film, I heard negative reports regarding Harrison Ford's so-called Russian accent. Let's try to see beyond the accents and experience what the film is really about. The K19 is on its maiden voyage and wasn't truly ready to sail. The crew is young, inexperience and scared. Their acting captain and the man they know and trust as their captain are in the showdown of their lives. Ford and Neeson should be proud of their performance that put them in line with the classic showdowns of Clark Gable/Burt Lancaster (1958-""Run Silent, Run Deep"") and Denzel Washington/Gene Hackman (1995-""Crimson Tide""). This film has spectacular sound effects and special underwater effects that made me hold my breath like I did with ""U-571"". Outstanding cinematography, fabulous acting and casting.

Under-built, under-supplied, under-staffed, the K-19 submarine hovered on the edge of disaster every minute it was afloat.Then it fell over the edge.This is a movie about soldiers fighting a Cold War that was very real to them, as real as the torpedo in the cradle they sat next to. Their mission was sabotaged from the start, by the very political leaders they served, by the belief that political purity would overcome any failure of physical resources. (An offhand joke partway through said it all - about a cosmonaut whose air supply failed, and who wasn't loyal enough to the party to hold his breath.) Still, they did their jobs as soldiers, even walking into sure and painful death to save the rest of their crew.This movie is a remarkable contrast to actual Cold War movies. The submarine crew is drawn sympathetically. Harrison Ford's character is a little deeper than the others, poised between party loyalty, a military sense of honor and duty, and a fatherly view of his crew.This isn't the most complex role Ford has ever played. Still, he plays it well, as one expects. There is a bit of a coincidence, though. Ford is well on his way to being a grand old man of movies, much as Sean Connery has. Connery did his Russian submarine movie (Hunt for Red October), now Ford has done his. Is there some kind of a checklist that I don't know about?This is a good movie. It's a look from the post-Soviet era back into the Cold War - however little shooting there may have been, it was a war nonetheless and this is a war movie. It doesn't glorify war, quite the opposite, but it does honor the soldiers stuck with the job of fighting it.//wiredweird",4,"Brave men, insane leaders",1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,1755,"['Widowmaker', 'even', 'was', 'launched', 'killed', 'ten', 'own', 'crew', 'construction', 'crew', 'Under-built', 'under-supplied', 'under-staffed', 'K-19', 'submarine', 'hovered', 'edge', 'disaster', 'minute', 'was', 'afloat.Then', 'fell', 'edge.This', 'movie', 'soldiers', 'fighting', 'Cold', 'War', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'as', 'real', 'torpedo', 'cradle', 'sat', 'next', 'mission', 'was', 'sabotaged', 'start', 'very', 'political', 'leaders', 'served', 'belief', 'political', 'purity', 'would', 'overcome', 'failure', 'physical', 'resources', 'offhand', 'joke', 'partway', 'said', 'cosmonaut', 'air', 'supply', 'failed', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'loyal', 'enough', 'party', 'hold', 'breath', 'Still', 'did', 'jobs', 'soldiers', 'even', 'walking', 'sure', 'painful', 'death', 'save', 'rest', 'crew.This', 'movie', 'remarkable', 'contrast', 'actual', 'Cold', 'War', 'movies', 'submarine', 'crew', 'drawn', 'sympathetically', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'character', 'little', 'deeper', 'others', 'poised', 'party', 'loyalty', 'military', 'sense', 'honor', 'duty', 'fatherly', 'view', 'crew.This', ""n't"", 'most', 'complex', 'role', 'Ford', 'ever', 'played', 'Still', 'well', 'one', 'bit', 'coincidence', 'though', 'Ford', 'well', 'way', 'being', 'grand', 'old', 'man', 'movies', 'much', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Connery', 'did', 'Russian', 'submarine', 'movie', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'now', 'Ford', 'done', 'there', 'kind', 'checklist', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'good', 'movie', 'look', 'post-Soviet', 'era', 'back', 'Cold', 'War', 'however', 'little', 'shooting', 'there', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'war', 'nonetheless', 'war', 'movie', ""n't"", 'glorify', 'war', 'quite', 'opposite', 'honor', 'soldiers', 'stuck', 'job', 'fighting', 'it.//wiredweird']",N/A
