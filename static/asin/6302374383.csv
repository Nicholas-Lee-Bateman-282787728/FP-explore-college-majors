309100,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6302374383,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[21, 28]","THE DOVE is a formulaic and predictable Hollywoodization of Robin Lee Graham's bestselling book, DOVE.  Graham was the youngest male sailor to complete a circumnavigation, in a 24 foot sloop.&quot;The Dove&quot;  suffers from too much saccharine and not enough vinegar. While the location  shooting is superb, the film hardly lives up to it's storyline, downplaying  the dangers and the risks of singlehanded sailing in favor of overkill on  the romantic side. The actual passage becomes a pseudodocumentary, mostly  lacking in drama, and secondary to the love story. The Grahams'(Robin Lee  and Patti's) love story as shown is sickeningly sweet.The movie is not  helped by the fact that neither Bottoms nor Raffin can act their way out of  a paper bag. They are saddled with a poor script and truly maudlin  dialogue. Rather than being a theatrical release the film has an  &quot;Afterschool Special&quot; feel to it.Despite it's drawbacks, it  is well worth watching if you are (1) a sailing fanatic who can't get  enough of boats, (2) stuck inside the house on a rainy day (with or without  the kids) with nothing much to do, and (3) a reader of DOVE who is familiar  with the story.THE DOVE is harmless, enjoyable fluff.",2,&quot;The Dove&quot; is One-Quarter Whipped Cream,963532800,"07 14, 2000",2000,1224,"['DOVE', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'Hollywoodization', 'Robin', 'Lee', 'Graham', 'bestselling', 'book', 'DOVE', 'Graham', 'was', 'youngest', 'male', 'sailor', 'complete', 'circumnavigation', '24', 'foot', 'sloop.', 'quot', 'Dove', 'quot', 'suffers', 'too', 'much', 'saccharine', 'not', 'enough', 'vinegar', 'location', 'shooting', 'superb', 'film', 'hardly', 'up', 'storyline', 'downplaying', 'dangers', 'risks', 'singlehanded', 'sailing', 'favor', 'overkill', 'romantic', 'side', 'actual', 'passage', 'pseudodocumentary', 'mostly', 'lacking', 'drama', 'secondary', 'love', 'story', 'Grahams', 'Robin', 'Lee', 'Patti', 'love', 'story', 'shown', 'sickeningly', 'sweet.The', 'movie', 'not', 'helped', 'fact', 'Bottoms', 'Raffin', 'can', 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'are', 'saddled', 'poor', 'script', 'truly', 'maudlin', 'dialogue', 'Rather', 'being', 'theatrical', 'release', 'film', 'quot', 'Afterschool', 'Special', 'quot', 'feel', 'it.Despite', 'drawbacks', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', '1', 'sailing', 'fanatic', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'boats', '2', 'stuck', 'house', 'rainy', 'day', 'kids', 'nothing', 'much', 'do', '3', 'reader', 'DOVE', 'who', 'familiar', 'story.THE', 'DOVE', 'harmless', 'enjoyable', 'fluff']",N/A

I wanted so badly to like this film having enjoyed the book so much, but I couldn't even when allowing for the timeframe in which it was made.Dove could have been told as a romance or as an adventure even both,but the screen play is terrible.  The movie fails from the begining in any movie' primary task - to make the viewer care about the main characters.  When The Dove tries to be an adventure Joseph Bottoms who looks remarkably like Robin is impressive however most of the film attempts to be a character study of Robin and Bottoms is not up to the task.Raffkin does a fair job playing Patty and other acters put in solid performances.  The musical score by the same talent that wrote born free is very acceptable, but they can't overcome Bottoms' failure and the screenplays defects.Robin comes across as spoiled and inmature in the extreme and Patty stuck playing his mother more than his lover.

309102,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6302374383,Westley,"[1, 1]","""The Dove"" is based on the true-life story of Robin Lee Graham (Joseph Bottoms), a 16-year-old from California who circumnavigated the globe sailing unassisted.  He was the first teenager to complete the feat, although it took him nearly 5 years due to his frequent stops.  Along the way, he met his future wife, Patti (Deborah Raffin), who ended up following him on land.For a film about sailing, I was surprised by the relative lack of sailing scenes.  In particular, in his real-life voyage, Graham encountered numerous storms and his boat was even demasted several times.  Instead, the movie spent far more time on his budding relationship with Patti and his stops on land.  I guess these elements were far easier to film than sailing scenes.  It's a pity, though, because I didn't find much compelling about the romance story, and the scenes of sailing were beautifully filmed, which is not surprising considering that the masterful Sven Nykvist was the cinematographer.  The film gets a bit more interesting when depicting Graham's weariness with the trip; although, it too often makes it seem like he just wants to be done with it all so he can spend more time with his girlfriend.Joseph Bottoms fills the role of wind-swept 70s California teenager quite well; his earnest smile and blank stare suit the role.  He was awarded with the Golden Globe for New Star of the Year - Actor.  The movie may be a bit too saccharine, though, for some audiences.  The 1975 reviewer from the New York Times noted that the two main actors ""grin and glow at each other until you yearn for a catastrophe.""  I didn't have quite a strong reaction against the sweetness of the film, but I did yearn for a bit more realism.  The movie ends up playing like a family film, but I can't think of many kids who would enjoy watching the syrupy romance, so I'm a bit puzzled as to who might best like this film.",3,"Row, row, row your boat",1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,1890,"['Dove', 'based', 'true-life', 'story', 'Robin', 'Lee', 'Graham', 'Joseph', 'Bottoms', '16-year-old', 'California', 'who', 'circumnavigated', 'globe', 'sailing', 'unassisted', 'was', 'first', 'teenager', 'complete', 'feat', 'took', 'nearly', '5', 'years', 'due', 'frequent', 'stops', 'way', 'met', 'future', 'wife', 'Patti', 'Deborah', 'Raffin', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'following', 'land.For', 'film', 'sailing', 'was', 'surprised', 'relative', 'lack', 'sailing', 'scenes', 'particular', 'real-life', 'voyage', 'Graham', 'encountered', 'numerous', 'storms', 'boat', 'was', 'even', 'demasted', 'several', 'times', 'Instead', 'movie', 'spent', 'far', 'more', 'time', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Patti', 'stops', 'land', 'guess', 'elements', 'were', 'far', 'easier', 'film', 'sailing', 'scenes', 'pity', 'though', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'compelling', 'romance', 'story', 'scenes', 'sailing', 'were', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'masterful', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'was', 'cinematographer', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'depicting', 'Graham', 'weariness', 'trip', 'too', 'often', 'seem', 'just', 'be', 'done', 'so', 'can', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'girlfriend.Joseph', 'Bottoms', 'role', 'wind-swept', '70s', 'California', 'teenager', 'quite', 'well', 'earnest', 'smile', 'blank', 'stare', 'suit', 'role', 'was', 'awarded', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'New', 'Star', 'Year', 'Actor', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'saccharine', 'though', 'audiences', '1975', 'reviewer', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'noted', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'grin', 'glow', 'other', 'yearn', 'catastrophe', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'strong', 'reaction', 'sweetness', 'film', 'did', 'yearn', 'bit', 'more', 'realism', 'movie', 'up', 'playing', 'family', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'kids', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'syrupy', 'romance', ""'m"", 'bit', 'puzzled', 'who', 'might', 'best', 'film']",N/A
