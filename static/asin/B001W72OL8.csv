1244277,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B001W72OL8,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[1, 3]","It starts out with a brother and a sister at a cemetary, where the famous phrase ""They're coming to get you Barbara"" is coined. Once the brother is dispatched by a passing zombie, the sister makes her way to a seemingly abandoned house where she meets up with a black man who seems to be quite handy at boarding up doors and windows except for the most obvious ones behind him in key shots.There's the typical idiot who decides boarding himself up with his family in the cellar is a good idea along with the usual dumb couple that blows themselves up in a truck after the boyfriend seems to forget that gas is flammable and shouldn't be splashed around a nearby lit torch. Of course there's also shots of zombies or rather people walking around aimlessly and sorta fighting to get in to munch on the people in the house.Now while this is said to be a classic and did launch the zombie film genre it is quite boring, badly acted and not very well paced to be honest. The main actress is simply boring, the black guy is about the only halfway decent actor and everyone else is simply bad to say the least. Thankfully the guys do a fantastic job with the material, for the most part they slam this film quite well and in very funny fashion.Some of their best riffs are aimed at the Pittsburgh natives and sports teams, also they take time to slam the midwest and the riffs they throw at the cast are gold especially those they have for the main actress who is truly a borefest. For fans of the guys, MST3K and Rifftrax this is a great addition to your DVD collection.",5,Ready.... aim.... meander,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,1564,"['out', 'brother', 'sister', 'cemetary', 'where', 'famous', 'phrase', ""'re"", 'coming', 'get', 'Barbara', 'coined', 'brother', 'dispatched', 'passing', 'zombie', 'sister', 'way', 'seemingly', 'abandoned', 'house', 'where', 'up', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'quite', 'handy', 'boarding', 'up', 'doors', 'windows', 'most', 'obvious', 'ones', 'key', 'typical', 'idiot', 'who', 'boarding', 'up', 'family', 'cellar', 'good', 'idea', 'usual', 'dumb', 'couple', 'up', 'truck', 'boyfriend', 'forget', 'gas', 'flammable', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'splashed', 'nearby', 'lit', 'torch', 'course', 'also', 'shots', 'zombies', 'rather', 'people', 'walking', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'sorta', 'fighting', 'get', 'munch', 'people', 'house.Now', 'said', 'be', 'classic', 'did', 'launch', 'zombie', 'film', 'genre', 'quite', 'boring', 'badly', 'acted', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'paced', 'be', 'honest', 'main', 'actress', 'simply', 'boring', 'black', 'guy', 'only', 'halfway', 'decent', 'actor', 'everyone', 'else', 'simply', 'bad', 'say', 'least', 'Thankfully', 'guys', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'material', 'most', 'part', 'slam', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'very', 'funny', 'fashion.Some', 'best', 'riffs', 'are', 'aimed', 'Pittsburgh', 'natives', 'sports', 'teams', 'also', 'take', 'time', 'slam', 'midwest', 'riffs', 'throw', 'cast', 'are', 'gold', 'especially', 'have', 'main', 'actress', 'who', 'truly', 'borefest', 'fans', 'guys', 'MST3K', 'Rifftrax', 'great', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection']",Rifftrax: Night of the Living Dead - from the stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000!

The old MST3K crew of Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett take it on with quite a few funny riffs.  Some don't quite hit the spot, and the guys miss some choice moments to riff,  but that's always the case with Rifftrax.  One of the better ones was, ""A Zombie's Worst enemy, a Clothesline.""  The clueless young couple who try to escape the zombies and the ultra-Angry family man get lots of attention.  Rifftrax does not include old MST3K things like skits, sets, or the Bots.  You never See the guys in any form.  You simply HEAR them from the beginning to the end of the movie.  Not even an Intro!I also recommend Rifftrax ""House on Haunted Hill.""

I have been a fan of the MST3K series since 1993 and, as far as Rifftrax goes, I have only seen 9 episodes and none have been memorable except the shorts collections and Plan 9. I feel that the majority of the jokes fell flat and there weren't enough good jokes to revisit this episode. I watched it twice to give it a fair chance but it sounds like their joke barrel has run dry.

1244281,A1VZXLQXB022ST,B001W72OL8,Timothy P. Young,"[1, 1]","The premise is simple--find a movie and make fun of it with a commentary track.  It's harder than it sounds, I'm sure, but Mike Nelson and company do an outstanding job of taking down one of my personal favorite cult films, ""Night of the Living Dead.""The fun starts early, with jibes not only aimed at the actors onscreen, but 'technical' aspects of a shot (which serves the dual purpose of making fun of commentary tracks in general).  It continues throughout the film, at various levels of inspiration, from silly sex jokes to esoteric references to wry, shrewd observations.  And since the film was shot around Pittsburgh, there are several references to the Pittsburgh Steelers, just to keep us on our toes.I'm sure my neighbors must think I'm crazy, because I sat on the sofa laughing hysterically for at least half of the 96 minute runtime.  Hilarious.  I mean that.Also, as a 'bonus,' you can watch the film without the RiffTrax commentary.
