If you're expecting superb special effects, Oscar-winning performances, and top-name stars, look elsewhere.  ""Sinners and Saints"" is a modern day homage, or perhaps a tricked-out throwback, to the violent rogue cop films of the 1970s.  With a bit less gore, more implied violence, and less fashionable street clothes, this could easily have passed as a ""Dirty Harry"" film.A number of reviewers have touched on the torture and gore in the film.  It's strong stuff, to be sure, but I've seen a lot worse.  Be warned, though, that this is not really ""date night"" material.  That said, you get a convincing performance from Johnny Strong in the lead with a host of extended cameos from the better known stars.  Tom Berenger gruffs his way through a few quick scenes as Strong's boss and mentor, Sean Patrick Flanery cusses constantly while struggling to maintain a decent New Orleans accent as Strong's troubled brother, and poor Jolene Blalock delivers in a single but powerful scene as Flanery's junkie girlfriend.While there's virtually no re-play value in ""Sinners and Saints,"" you could do a alot worse for a Friday night rental. It's brisk, gritty, and action-driven with plenty of bullets and blood for an evening of mindless, harmless entertainment.",4,"A decent, gritty action flick",1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,1429,"['When', 'take', 'account', 'direct-to-video', 'movie', 'shot', 'much', 'smaller', 'budget', 'similar', 'genre', 'flicks', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'gritty', 'action', 'film', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'superb', 'special', 'effects', 'Oscar-winning', 'performances', 'top-name', 'stars', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Sinners', 'Saints', 'modern', 'day', 'homage', 'perhaps', 'tricked-out', 'throwback', 'violent', 'rogue', 'cop', 'films', '1970s', 'bit', 'less', 'gore', 'more', 'implied', 'violence', 'less', 'fashionable', 'street', 'clothes', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'passed', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'film.A', 'number', 'reviewers', 'have', 'touched', 'torture', 'gore', 'film', 'strong', 'stuff', 'be', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'worse', 'Be', 'warned', 'not', 'really', 'date', 'night', 'material', 'said', 'get', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'Strong', 'lead', 'host', 'extended', 'cameos', 'better', 'known', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'gruffs', 'way', 'few', 'quick', 'scenes', 'Strong', 'boss', 'mentor', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'constantly', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'decent', 'New', 'Orleans', 'accent', 'Strong', 'troubled', 'brother', 'poor', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'delivers', 'single', 'powerful', 'scene', 'Flanery', 'junkie', 'girlfriend.While', 'virtually', 're-play', 'value', 'Sinners', 'Saints', 'could', 'do', 'alot', 'worse', 'Friday', 'night', 'rental', 'brisk', 'gritty', 'action-driven', 'plenty', 'bullets', 'blood', 'evening', 'mindless', 'harmless', 'entertainment']",N/A

There's nothing special about its story, its the same cops/robbers type repeatedly done, which is not per se a problem, but it certainly offers nothing inventive.  Overdone concepts are ok if they're at least entertaining, and this movie is at least somewhat entertaining.  My issues are over acting and production values.  For the most part, no really recognizable faces are used, and their inexperience really shows - meaning the acting is weak.  Its not horrible, but there's quite a few scenes where the bad acting becomes noticable (but not quite grating either).  The production values were odd though.  At times the film felt big budget, with grandiose and big attempt shots, but they ultimately fell short.  It kept feeling like the director was trying to achieve too much with creative camera work, while not really nailing the fundamentals.  Creative camera work cannot make up for weak acting other other basic issues, and that's where my primary issue with this film lies.

Please be aware of the high amount of adult language being used in this film and the adult content: intense gun/blood/shooting scenes. I even found certain parts to be funny, for example in one of the most intense gun fights in the movie one of the bad guys gets shot up and all he can say is ""F Psycho Cops"" the entire time... hubby and I looked at each other and started to laugh so hard for it was true he is a psycho cop and they all better watch out because he is coming for your ass.

But after a few minutes, it evolved into a non-stop action packed affair, with one gun battle after another.  It seemed that almost everyone owned an assault weapon and the landscape quickly became filled with bullet riddled and charred bodies.  The film is set in post-Katrina New Orleans and it has a grittiness that made the entire City look like a war zone.There are two warring factions and Detective Sean Riley, played by Johnny Strong, is assigned to figure out what is going on and to bring the hostilities to an end.  Strong and the rest of the cast do credible job in their roles.The plot is predictable, but has some major loopholes.  For example, the hostilities by one faction are directed by a Russian mafia type boss, but we never really learn what his interest is in the outcome.  By the end of the film, nearly all of the bad guys (and some of the good guys) are dead, but the Russian boss apparently survives and is never heard from again.The real stars of this movie are the never ending gun battles and unarmed combat.  They are well choreographed and seem realistic and the special effects are good.

1505522,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005YCEHWQ,Chris Kennison,"[1, 2]","""Sinners and Saints"" was a pleasant surprise. Is it a b-movie? Without question. It houses a bunch of actors you've never heard of but do a good job and some you may have heard of like mostly T.V. actor Costas Mandylor. Judging the movie for what it is, it can only hit a certain threshold and it gets pretty close. The movie isn't without flaw, but it certainly makes the most of the appealing aspects of multiple weapons being fired on a viewing audience.First of all, the title of the movie, ""Sinners and Saints"" is pretty bad. There are no ""Saints"" in this movie. In fact, nobody comes even close with the exception of Detective Sean Riley's (Johnny Strong) 2nd partner Detective Will Ganz (Kevin Phillips). That being said, who really cares? I mean, we want to see bullets and death right? Well, you get it in spades. You get college kids set a fire, gunfights every 2 minutes, houses exploding, more people set on fire, and in between the gunfights you get more gunfights or maybe just a single bullet to the skull of somebody who didn't see it coming or somebody stepping on a bullet riddled body. As far as action movies go, you don't get cheated.In fact, there's so much action, that you start to wish you were watching the news on the day or two that this movie takes place, just to see all the gunfights going on in town. Part of the story should have been people fleeing the war zone to safer cities.My biggest problem with the movie though was the obvious comparisons to numerous cop and buddy/cop movies of the past. There are so many references to other movies that I almost lost count. The two main cops are an obvious comparison to Mel Gibson & Danny Glover's Lethal Weapon characters. There is even a birthday party with Riggs/Riley characters feeling out of place, leaving the room and having a nice conversation with his partners wife. Dirty Harry also shows his influence as well.This is a good movie. I won't deny that, I just wish it had a little more uniqueness and less copy cat. When you watch a movie and can't help thinking of a far superior movie because of it's similarities, it only makes you wish you were watching ""Lethal Weapon"" instead. The building of characters and the quality of the superior film, remind you that ""Sinners and Saints"" is no ""Lethal Weapon"".",3,"Somebody watched Lethal Weapon, Dirty Harry and lots of other great action movies",1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2296,"['Sinners', 'Saints', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'b-movie', 'question', 'houses', 'bunch', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'mostly', 'T.V', 'actor', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'Judging', 'movie', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'hit', 'certain', 'threshold', 'pretty', 'close', 'movie', ""n't"", 'flaw', 'certainly', 'most', 'appealing', 'aspects', 'multiple', 'weapons', 'being', 'fired', 'viewing', 'audience.First', 'title', 'movie', 'Sinners', 'Saints', 'pretty', 'bad', 'are', 'Saints', 'movie', 'fact', 'nobody', 'even', 'close', 'exception', 'Detective', 'Sean', 'Riley', 'Johnny', 'Strong', '2nd', 'partner', 'Detective', 'Will', 'Ganz', 'Kevin', 'Phillips', 'being', 'said', 'who', 'really', 'mean', 'want', 'see', 'bullets', 'death', 'right', 'Well', 'get', 'spades', 'get', 'college', 'kids', 'set', 'fire', 'gunfights', '2', 'minutes', 'houses', 'exploding', 'more', 'people', 'set', 'fire', 'gunfights', 'get', 'more', 'gunfights', 'maybe', 'just', 'single', 'bullet', 'skull', 'somebody', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'somebody', 'stepping', 'bullet', 'riddled', 'body', 'As', 'far', 'action', 'movies', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'cheated.In', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'start', 'wish', 'were', 'watching', 'news', 'day', 'two', 'movie', 'place', 'just', 'see', 'gunfights', 'going', 'town', 'Part', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'people', 'fleeing', 'war', 'zone', 'safer', 'cities.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'obvious', 'comparisons', 'numerous', 'cop', 'buddy/cop', 'movies', 'past', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'references', 'other', 'movies', 'almost', 'lost', 'count', 'two', 'main', 'cops', 'are', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'characters', 'even', 'birthday', 'party', 'Riggs/Riley', 'characters', 'feeling', 'place', 'leaving', 'room', 'having', 'nice', 'conversation', 'partners', 'wife', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'also', 'influence', 'well.This', 'good', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'uniqueness', 'less', 'copy', 'cat', 'When', 'watch', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'similarities', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'watching', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'instead', 'building', 'characters', 'quality', 'superior', 'film', 'remind', 'Sinners', 'Saints', 'Lethal', 'Weapon']",N/A

Anyway just so you know those in the kind movies I enjoyed plus many more I think it's good when you have a review from a person to know some other movies are they like.This movie has everything you'd want from a cop drama/figure out why the bad guys are motivated to be bad type of movie. But I found it to be a little bit weak in the story department and in the character development. Now the type of person who likes a movie to have a decent story but more importantly I want to care about the characters. This movie kind of feels just thrown together and kind of like they had an idea but they couldn't really pull it all together. Now does that mean that this movie is bad? Not really I mean I liked it enough to watch the whole thing and try to figure out why the bad guys are motivated to be bad was interesting. The way look at a movie like this I would never watch it again or what I spent time watching with somebody who's never seen it before. Which is what I'll do with the movie that I truly enjoy.  and that is all because of a real lack of character development.Now this movie is one that FPSRussia would approve of... Plenty of gun fights & carnage!

1505532,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B005YCEHWQ,E. David Swan,"[1, 1]","I always wondered how these direct to DVD movies make money and who in the world buys them. I guess my suspicion would be big fans of action movies for whom the Hollywood output is not enough to satisfy their craving. I was a teen in the 80's, the ultimate era of the over the top action theatrical release, so I can imagine fans of that type of movie desiring more than is currently hitting theaters and straight to DVD is the only other option. Action is the raison d'tre for `Sinners and Saints' and action is where it will succeed or fail. So does it succeed? Somewhat.If you love gun battles and watching automatic weapons fire this is the movie for you. The plot involves a large group of ex soldiers, includes the awesome Bas Rutten, searching for the classic McGuffin while torturing people by lighting them on fire extinguishing the fire and then repeating several more times to produce a rather disturbing corpse. It really doesn't matter what they're looking for as it's all just a vehicle to allow for the firing of guns guns guns. On there trail is Detective Sean Riley played by actor Johnny Strong (seriously, according to Wikipedia that's his actual name). Strong is one of those actors with a high likeability factor but his acting is pretty weak and he only seems to know how to project one look, a seething glare. Still, he does a good job of giving the impression of a legitimate tough guy and his one hand to hand action scene is done well.Detective Sean Riley has two great skills. He is amazing with a pistol and twice wins gun battles where he is greatly outnumbered and massively outgunned. But his true talent is that he is impossible to hit. If a half dozen expert shots are spraying his location with bullets they will not hit him. If the main villain is walking towards Riley a few yards away and Riley simply stands in front of him making no attempt to avoid being shot no bullets will find their mark. Riley is helped by the fact that in the `Sinners and Saints' universe bullets cannot penetrate even the thinnest of barriers so if he hides behind a car or the wall of a house he is as safe as someone behind a three foot thick vault door.I have not been a fan of the way modern movies have filmed action scenes with the fast cuts and close up shots. This culminated in Quantum of Solace which was generally an indecipherable blur of movement. Sinners and Saints uses the fast cuts but not to the extent where I can't discern the action. This movie manages the technique correctly whereas Quantum of Solace failed (and it kills me to write that).By and large I thought this was a decent effort for a direct to DVD movie. There are even some moments where the dialogue is quite good and believable particularly in some of the interaction between Riley and his partner Will. I wish it wasn't so repetitious in its use of gun fights but at least they looked good even if they were unrealistic. If I paid to see this movie in the theater I would be disappointed but this isn't a theatrical release so I don't hold it to those standards. Let me finish by saying that Bas Rutten's acting is the best I've seen of any MMA fighter/actor and I wouldn't mind at all seeing him in a larger role in the future.",3,Piles and Piles of Gun Action,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,3230,"['always', 'wondered', 'how', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movies', 'make', 'money', 'who', 'world', 'guess', 'suspicion', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'fans', 'action', 'movies', 'whom', 'Hollywood', 'output', 'not', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'craving', 'was', 'teen', '80', 'ultimate', 'era', 'top', 'action', 'theatrical', 'release', 'can', 'imagine', 'fans', 'type', 'movie', 'desiring', 'more', 'currently', 'hitting', 'theaters', 'straight', 'DVD', 'only', 'other', 'option', 'Action', 'raison', ""d'tre"", 'Sinners', 'Saints', 'action', 'where', 'will', 'succeed', 'fail', 'So', 'succeed', 'Somewhat.If', 'love', 'gun', 'battles', 'watching', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'fire', 'movie', 'plot', 'large', 'group', 'ex', 'soldiers', 'awesome', 'Bas', 'Rutten', 'searching', 'classic', 'McGuffin', 'torturing', 'people', 'lighting', 'fire', 'extinguishing', 'fire', 'then', 'repeating', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'produce', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'corpse', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'just', 'vehicle', 'allow', 'firing', 'guns', 'guns', 'guns', 'trail', 'Detective', 'Sean', 'Riley', 'played', 'actor', 'Johnny', 'Strong', 'seriously', 'according', 'Wikipedia', 'actual', 'name', 'Strong', 'one', 'actors', 'high', 'likeability', 'factor', 'acting', 'pretty', 'weak', 'only', 'know', 'how', 'project', 'one', 'look', 'seething', 'glare', 'Still', 'good', 'job', 'giving', 'impression', 'legitimate', 'tough', 'guy', 'one', 'hand', 'hand', 'action', 'scene', 'done', 'well.Detective', 'Sean', 'Riley', 'two', 'great', 'skills', 'amazing', 'pistol', 'twice', 'wins', 'gun', 'battles', 'where', 'greatly', 'outnumbered', 'massively', 'outgunned', 'true', 'talent', 'impossible', 'hit', 'half', 'dozen', 'expert', 'shots', 'are', 'spraying', 'location', 'bullets', 'will', 'not', 'hit', 'main', 'villain', 'walking', 'towards', 'Riley', 'few', 'yards', 'away', 'Riley', 'simply', 'front', 'making', 'attempt', 'avoid', 'being', 'shot', 'bullets', 'will', 'find', 'mark', 'Riley', 'helped', 'fact', 'Sinners', 'Saints', 'universe', 'bullets', 'can', 'not', 'penetrate', 'even', 'thinnest', 'barriers', 'so', 'car', 'wall', 'house', 'as', 'safe', 'someone', 'three', 'foot', 'thick', 'vault', 'door.I', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'fan', 'way', 'modern', 'movies', 'have', 'filmed', 'action', 'scenes', 'fast', 'cuts', 'close', 'up', 'shots', 'culminated', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'was', 'generally', 'indecipherable', 'blur', 'movement', 'Sinners', 'Saints', 'fast', 'cuts', 'not', 'extent', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discern', 'action', 'movie', 'technique', 'correctly', 'whereas', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'failed', 'write', '.By', 'large', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'effort', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movie', 'are', 'even', 'moments', 'where', 'dialogue', 'quite', 'good', 'believable', 'particularly', 'interaction', 'Riley', 'partner', 'Will', 'wish', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'repetitious', 'use', 'gun', 'fights', 'least', 'looked', 'good', 'even', 'were', 'unrealistic', 'paid', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'theatrical', 'release', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'standards', 'Let', 'finish', 'saying', 'Bas', 'Rutten', 'acting', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'MMA', 'fighter/actor', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'larger', 'role', 'future']",N/A

The bad guys are quite a deplorable lot and the movie does a good job of letting you know who Sean is up against. You also know what is at stake and I really was rooting for the good guys.The plot is good, but pretty basic. The trail of clues is interesting as Sean and his partner uncover them, and they fit together.A few times I was confused at what exactly had happened in the events that lead to the movie plot (clues reveal some history), but I could follow along to understand what was going on.

I read a bunch of positive online reviews which seemed odd because I have never seen one advertisement.

I was pleasantly shocked that I found myself hooked from the opening battle-royal right through the end.I have never heard of this guy before but this director blew me away.  Like Michael Mann on a shoe-string budget he has talent that shines beyond his limited means.  He pulled no punches, no cgi and all the gun battles, explosions and fights were refreshingly very realistic.  This had the feel of a throw back action film.The story is simple and not too special.  Two cops team up to solve a series of killings in New Orleans.  Turns out one of the cops childhood friends is involved in a military coverup and things begin to tumble out of control. Solid film but not for the faint of heart.  Some intense violence. Strong performances across the board with great turns from home grown favorites Costas  and Louis Mandylor as a baddies.  Cool Method Man, classy Jurgen Prochnow, Jolene Blalock (not seen enough ;)Kevin Phillips, the great Kim Coates and Bas Rutten make this grand buffet of watchable and interesting characters seldom seen in typical low budget fare.

1505543,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B005YCEHWQ,J. B. Hoyos,"[1, 1]","Sean Riley, a highly decorated war hero, is a detective for the New Orleans Police Department who is investigating a series of grisly murders.  Professional hit men are torturing their victims by repeating dousing them with gasoline and setting them ablaze.  Riley suspects his wayward brother, Colin, is somehow involved.  As Sean draws closer to discovering the identity of the villain who is ordering the hits, he puts the lives of everyone around him in jeopardy.William Kaufman's ""Sinners and Saints"" is a gruesome, violent, non-stop action film that kept me in suspense from beginning to end.  Major hunk Johnny Strong (the lead singer for ""Operator"") stars as Sean Riley, a morose, take-no-prisoners, Dirty Harry-like detective who is a superb killing machine because he has nothing to lose.  His son died of leukemia, his wife abandoned him and his former partner was shot to death during a crack house raid.  Ironically, he's been partnered with Detective Will Ganz (Kevin Phillips) who has the perfect, ""Norman Rockwell"" family.  Sean's strictly-by-the-books boss, Captain Trahan, is played by the legendary Tom Berenger; he is constantly badgering Riley to follow the rules and not be a loose cannon.  All the leads, especially Strong, gave excellent performances.""Sinners and Saints"" is a gritty noir that has plenty of explosions, shootouts, fight sequences and car chases.  In other words, it has all the requisites needed for a great action film. However, it also has a tremendous amount of human drama that will pull at your heartstrings.  Sean Riley has experienced a lot of tragedy; his poignant life story has brought tears to my eyes.  ""Sinners and Saints"" reveals both the good and the bad sides of mankind and the good and the bad that are in each of us.  Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish a sinner from a saint.  In the case of Riley, he is forced to kill in order to prevent his friends from being killed.  However, he sometimes appears a little too keen on massacring all the criminals around him.  He especially takes pleasure in shooting them point blank in the head with their eyes focused on him. Note: In France, the title of this DVD is ""Bad Cop.""My biggest shock came from Anchor Bay's lack of special features for this film.  Yes, it is presented in widescreen with SDH subtitles.  However, there is not an audio commentary from directors, actors, etc.  There is a very short making of featurette (approximately seven minutes) that is more like a long theatrical trailer; it provides footage of the special effects involved with the car chases and Johnny Strong being coached and prepped for his fighting sequences.  There are also some deleted scenes which are required viewing.  They lack commentary.  After watching them, I understand why some scenes were cut from the final product; however, there are some that should have been left in, especially the one dealing with Internal Affairs and the one involving Johnny being surrounded and abused by a group of professional hit men.Overall, I found ""Sinners and Saints"" to be a great example of New Orleans noir.  (Despite the lack of special features, the DVD is worth purchasing.)  I'm praying to the saints that there is a sequel.  Sean Riley is my new hero.  He's a wonderful blend of Sylvester Stallone's Lieutenant Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti (Cobra [Blu-ray])and Clint Eastwood's Police Inspector Harry ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan (Dirty Harry Collection (Dirty Harry / Magnum Force / The Enforcer / Sudden Impact / The Dead Pool) [Blu-ray]).  Fans of action thrillers will definitely want to watch ""Sinners and Saints.""  Be forewarned, the gasoline dousing/igniting torture scenes are rather graphic and disturbing; I cringed while watching them.Joseph B.

1505549,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005YCEHWQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","Never having heard of ""Sinners and Saints,"" I can honestly say that my expectations were appropriately grounded. Perhaps that's why the film came as such a pleasant surprise. It's certainly not the best, most professional, or most original movie that you'll see this year--but it works and that's the most important thing. It aims to be exciting and entertaining, and it succeeds at those modest goals without being insultingly idiotic! That's where so many straight-to-DVD endeavors go wrong, they oftentimes miss the point of having a coherent and reasonable screenplay. ""Sinners and Saints"" is an old school police actioner that has a satisfyingly high body count, a twisty narrative, and likable protagonists. It has plenty of shoot-outs, some gleefully unpleasant torture scenes, and plenty of fisticuffs tied together by an interesting story set in the dilapidated venues of post-Katrina New Orleans.When a series of grisly murders attract the attention of the NOPD brass, a hot-headed but street smart cop (Johnny Strong) is assigned to help the homicide detectives. The deaths appear to be linked to a powerful criminal enterprise, and Strong may have unexpected ties to the murders. His childhood friend (Sean Patrick Flanery) seems to be neck deep in the trouble. The cops spend most of the film trying to track down Flanery to discover just what is motivating this killing spree. Along the way, they become a target themselves and many scenes just end with a ridiculous amount of gunfire. The actual motives really don't matter that much, they just serve as a catalyst to initiate the violence and mayhem. And the action sequences are orchestrated with precision with a good mix of excitement, danger, and over-the-top fun.The movie certainly has its flaws and moments that strain credulity, but I liked it well enough to just go with the flow. Perhaps the biggest plot oversight involves the power player behind the criminal enterprise played by Jurgen Prochnow. The film ends with his story dangling in the wind, unresolved, and never to be mentioned again. I did love the endless supply of machine gun toting henchman that were available throughout the picture, the fact that the ending confrontation didn't arouse the interest of police or any passing cars, and the fact that a major character just showed up randomly at the same confrontation. But despite the expected silliness, the film still kept me involved. I give most of that credit to its lead actor, Johnny Strong. I'm not familiar with Strong, but if this is any indication--I expect I might be seeing him again. Credible as both an action star and in moments that required more character complexity, this guy should have a career. ""Sinners and Saints,"" at the end of the day, may not necessarily be a great movie but it is an effective and enjoyable one. It has relatively modest ambitions, and it succeeds at being the movie that it wants to be.

The hero, played by the gorgeous Johnny Strong (who also did the music), is a rogue cop.  Who is also a veteran.  Who, by the way, has already lost everything and therefore has. nothing. left. to. lose.  There's a sinister international plot afoot.  And a sane partner who is a family man.  You see where I'm going with this, right?  This movie is exactly what you would expect, right through the closing credits.  But that doesn't make it less awesome.  There's a reason we like these movies.  They speak to our senses of justice and to our feelings (sometimes) that we are alone in a dangerous world.  And everyone in this movie absolutely delivers on those expectations.Sinners and Saints is less garish than its big budget predecessors, and there wasn't a weak link in the cast.  I would have given it five stars except for its waste of New Orleans.  NOLA is a unique place.  If you're going to set your movie there, you should include at least some of the local characteristics that make it special.  This movie could have been set anywhere, save for one tiny plot point.

1505553,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005YCEHWQ,Mark Turner,"[2, 2]","It seems that beleaguered cops that take on criminals who are armed more like terrorists than criminals and then shoot those same criminals are held up to more scrutiny than the bad guys in films these days. A bad guy opens up with a machine gun and a rocket launcher on the police. After a chase, the policeman shoots the bad guy with a .45 and yet the public outcry is for the officer. I know, this is oversimplification but then again we're talking about a movie that may run anywhere from 80 to 120 minutes. The fact is in movies these days the police are often portrayed as more flawed than those they are trying to stop.Such is the case with SINNERS AND SAINTS. Johnny Strong portrays Det. Sean Riley, a New Orleans police officer who is facing major inquiries into his abilities for shooting criminals that shoot first and answer questions later. The movie opens with his partner being killed and another officer shot by a group they came to question. When they return fire and take out the bad guys, guess who might be brought up on charges and taken off the streets? Yep, the police.But there is more going on with Riley than just his partner's death. As the film proceeds we discover he's dealing with the death of his child and a divorce. His long time friend Colin (Sean Patrick Flannery) is completely unaware of this when he shows up out of the blue. They may have grown up together but they took separate paths. Colin always seems to end up in trouble. Before he leaves this time, he presents Riley with a gift that goes unopened.To keep Riley on the force his commander places him with a new partner, a homicide detective named Will Ganz (Kevin Phillips). Ganz is more the usual police detective, wears a suit and tie and digs for clues more often than interrogating suspects. The two would seem a perfect fit and actually do compliment one another. As they begin working together they start investigating a series of murders where the victims are tied to chairs and lit on fire only to have the flames extinguished and started over and over again. It's a particularly cruel form of torture but leads them to realize this isn't about serial killing; this is someone searching for something.As they track down clues and informants Colin's name comes up which puts Riley in a particularly bad situation. True to his duty, he seeks out his old friend with the hope of helping him before those responsible for these torture murders find him first. The clues lead to a group of mercenaries rather than street thugs. And the local street gang that suffered the loss of their leader's brother wants vengeance as well. What secret does Colin have that would cause these mercenaries to search for him?There is a spate of films being released straight to DVD these days from various companies, never making it to the local theater that uses several screens for their one hit film. Some are terrible and others like this one worth seeing. It may not feature a mega-star in the lead role but Strong is a credible actor who is quite believable here. Not only can he act, he handles the action portions of the role fine as well.The story is more believable than most as well. When the reason for the mercenaries search comes out and Colin's ties to it, it seems plausible.The weakest part of the movie is Phillips. He honestly seems to be trying his best but at the same time seems like he is acting rather than just being the role. Perhaps with time he will get past this. Let's hope.On the whole this movie isn't one that will result in repeated viewings but will offer a decent night's entertainment for fans of police stories, mysteries and action films. And with the performance he offers one hopes that Strong will find the perfect vehicle to take him to star status.",3,BAD TIMES IN THE BIG EASY,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,3775,"['beleaguered', 'cops', 'take', 'criminals', 'who', 'are', 'armed', 'more', 'terrorists', 'criminals', 'then', 'shoot', 'same', 'criminals', 'are', 'held', 'up', 'more', 'scrutiny', 'bad', 'guys', 'films', 'days', 'bad', 'guy', 'up', 'machine', 'gun', 'rocket', 'launcher', 'police', 'chase', 'policeman', 'shoots', 'bad', 'guy', '.45', 'yet', 'public', 'outcry', 'officer', 'know', 'oversimplification', 'then', 'again', ""'re"", 'talking', 'movie', 'may', 'run', 'anywhere', '80', '120', 'minutes', 'fact', 'movies', 'days', 'police', 'are', 'often', 'portrayed', 'more', 'flawed', 'are', 'trying', 'stop.Such', 'case', 'SINNERS', 'AND', 'SAINTS', 'Johnny', 'Strong', 'Det', 'Sean', 'Riley', 'New', 'Orleans', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'facing', 'major', 'inquiries', 'abilities', 'shooting', 'criminals', 'shoot', 'first', 'answer', 'questions', 'later', 'movie', 'partner', 'being', 'killed', 'officer', 'shot', 'group', 'came', 'question', 'When', 'return', 'fire', 'take', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'guess', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'charges', 'taken', 'off', 'streets', 'Yep', 'police.But', 'more', 'going', 'Riley', 'just', 'partner', 'death', 'film', 'proceeds', 'discover', 'dealing', 'death', 'child', 'divorce', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'Colin', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'completely', 'unaware', 'when', 'up', 'blue', 'may', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'together', 'took', 'separate', 'paths', 'Colin', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'trouble', 'time', 'Riley', 'gift', 'unopened.To', 'keep', 'Riley', 'force', 'commander', 'places', 'new', 'partner', 'homicide', 'detective', 'named', 'Will', 'Ganz', 'Kevin', 'Phillips', 'Ganz', 'more', 'usual', 'police', 'detective', 'suit', 'tie', 'digs', 'clues', 'more', 'often', 'interrogating', 'suspects', 'two', 'would', 'seem', 'perfect', 'fit', 'actually', 'do', 'compliment', 'one', 'begin', 'working', 'together', 'start', 'investigating', 'series', 'murders', 'where', 'victims', 'are', 'tied', 'chairs', 'lit', 'fire', 'only', 'have', 'flames', 'extinguished', 'started', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'particularly', 'cruel', 'form', 'torture', 'realize', ""n't"", 'about', 'serial', 'killing', 'someone', 'searching', 'something.As', 'track', 'down', 'clues', 'informants', 'Colin', 'name', 'up', 'Riley', 'particularly', 'bad', 'situation', 'True', 'duty', 'out', 'old', 'friend', 'hope', 'helping', 'responsible', 'torture', 'murders', 'find', 'first', 'clues', 'lead', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'rather', 'street', 'thugs', 'local', 'street', 'gang', 'suffered', 'loss', 'leader', 'brother', 'vengeance', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'secret', 'Colin', 'have', 'would', 'cause', 'mercenaries', 'search', 'spate', 'films', 'being', 'released', 'straight', 'DVD', 'days', 'various', 'companies', 'never', 'making', 'local', 'theater', 'several', 'screens', 'one', 'hit', 'film', 'are', 'terrible', 'others', 'one', 'worth', 'seeing', 'may', 'not', 'feature', 'mega-star', 'lead', 'role', 'Strong', 'credible', 'actor', 'who', 'quite', 'believable', 'here', 'Not', 'only', 'can', 'act', 'action', 'portions', 'role', 'fine', 'well.The', 'story', 'more', 'believable', 'most', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'reason', 'mercenaries', 'search', 'out', 'Colin', 'ties', 'plausible.The', 'weakest', 'part', 'movie', 'Phillips', 'honestly', 'be', 'trying', 'best', 'same', 'time', 'acting', 'rather', 'just', 'being', 'role', 'Perhaps', 'time', 'will', 'get', 'Let', 'hope.On', 'whole', 'movie', ""n't"", 'one', 'will', 'result', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'will', 'offer', 'decent', 'night', 'entertainment', 'fans', 'police', 'stories', 'mysteries', 'action', 'films', 'performance', 'one', 'Strong', 'will', 'find', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'take', 'star', 'status']",N/A

Indeed, these scenes are the best part of the picture.And, the story also starts out to be pretty compelling, as two New Orleans detectives, played by Johnny Strong and Kevin Phillips, begin investigating a series of gruesome murders in which the victims were burned alive.  It's soon discovered that the key to solving the mystery rests with a childhood friend of Strong's (Sean Patrick Flanery), a mercenary recently returned from the Middle East.Where the movie goes awry is in its second half.  Suddenly, characters start doing things that seem to have no motivation except for the fact that either the director or screenwriter commanded it.  Even the well-staged action sequences in the latter part of the picture fall flat.  They appear to be there for their own sake, rather than furthering the story.There also seems to be a never-ending supply of disposable bad guys whose only purpose in the movie is to show up, shoot hundreds of bullets at the hero, then get killed.  Their on-going presence reminds me of the ads for a 1950s science-fiction movie: ""Kill One and Two Take Its Place!""The cast, which includes Kim Coates and Tom Berenger in cameo roles, is competent, and the film provides many views of New Orleans not often seen on screen.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes some deleted scenes.

1505557,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,B005YCEHWQ,"Michelle L. Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[1, 1]","Sean Riley (Johnny Strong), a New Orleans Detective with no fear, has been in so many gunfights in the last four months that the department is starting to wonder how safe the criminals are with Riley on the street. Having recently lost his son to leukemia, and mourning the end of his marriage, Riley has turned to his work and bringing down the bad guys to soothe his soul. Working on a series of grisly murders perpetrated by some merciless killers with fellow Detective Will Gantz (Kevin Phillips), the two follow the clues where they lead. To complicate matters, Riley's friend, Colin (Sean Patrick Flanery), a mercenary and general screw-up, had made a sudden appearance. Colin is center in the middle of whatever is going on. Apparently, he is in possession of something that a bad guy, Raymond Crowe (Costas Mandylor) wants, and who will stop at nothing to get it back. Afterall Crowe has a secret, and is willing to silence all witnesses to keep it that way.Overall, I really liked Sinners & Saints. It was gritty and offered tons of entertainment. There were tons gunfights, lots of trash talk, a cocaine snorting bad guy, and a handsome leading man. The acting was decent (Tom Berenger is still solid as a rock) and I loved the gritty cinematography. And the only somewhat annoying thing about the movie was Gantz's character. There were times that he seemed to whine and I personally wanted him to ""man up"" and get in the game (and when he eventually takes some sort of stand, you will roll your eyes). But eventually you overlook his faults because you realize that Riley's character was strong because he had some life experiences (the military, his wife's departure and his son's premature death) that solidified his fearless personality, while Gantz was just ""what he was"" (a rookie detective who really had not been in the mist of action and had a lot to lose). Therefore, Strong's nothing to lose, yet sympathetic and brooding persona, definitely outshined those irritants and made this an entertaining and highly enjoyable movie.  I give it a 4.5 or 5.",5,More Saint than Sinner.,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,2070,"['Sean', 'Riley', 'Johnny', 'Strong', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Detective', 'fear', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'gunfights', 'last', 'four', 'months', 'department', 'starting', 'wonder', 'how', 'safe', 'criminals', 'are', 'Riley', 'street', 'Having', 'recently', 'lost', 'son', 'leukemia', 'mourning', 'end', 'marriage', 'Riley', 'turned', 'work', 'bringing', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'soothe', 'soul', 'Working', 'series', 'grisly', 'murders', 'perpetrated', 'merciless', 'killers', 'fellow', 'Detective', 'Will', 'Gantz', 'Kevin', 'Phillips', 'two', 'follow', 'clues', 'where', 'lead', 'complicate', 'matters', 'Riley', 'friend', 'Colin', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'mercenary', 'general', 'screw-up', 'had', 'made', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'Colin', 'center', 'middle', 'going', 'Apparently', 'possession', 'something', 'bad', 'guy', 'Raymond', 'Crowe', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'back', 'Afterall', 'Crowe', 'secret', 'willing', 'silence', 'witnesses', 'keep', 'way.Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'Sinners', 'Saints', 'was', 'gritty', 'offered', 'tons', 'entertainment', 'were', 'tons', 'gunfights', 'lots', 'trash', 'talk', 'cocaine', 'snorting', 'bad', 'guy', 'handsome', 'leading', 'man', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'still', 'solid', 'rock', 'loved', 'gritty', 'cinematography', 'only', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'Gantz', 'character', 'were', 'times', 'seemed', 'whine', 'personally', 'wanted', 'man', 'up', 'get', 'game', 'when', 'eventually', 'sort', 'stand', 'will', 'roll', 'eyes', 'eventually', 'overlook', 'faults', 'realize', 'Riley', 'character', 'was', 'strong', 'had', 'life', 'experiences', 'military', 'wife', 'departure', 'son', 'premature', 'death', 'solidified', 'fearless', 'personality', 'Gantz', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'rookie', 'detective', 'who', 'really', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'mist', 'action', 'had', 'lot', 'lose', 'Therefore', 'Strong', 'nothing', 'lose', 'sympathetic', 'brooding', 'persona', 'definitely', 'outshined', 'irritants', 'made', 'entertaining', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'give', '4.5', '5']",N/A

And as if that's not enough, it's set in a post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, with characters making reference to ""bodies floating by and no one cared"" and sharing about how they would rather live in downtown Baghdad than the Big Easy.Of course, like every other bowl of gumbo, you'd better plan on chewing a few mouthfuls of slimy okra before you hit the bottom of THIS bowl.The film WANTS star Jimmy Strong to be a memorable and dynamic lead figure, but the elaborate tattoos, close-cropped beard and consistently deadpan, moody demeanor just add up to ""I've seen this all before, and when I saw it before, it was done better.""Five minutes into the movie, your're knee-deep into the first semiautomatic weapon gun battle. They whip these out every ten to fifteen minutes throughout the film, especially when the paper-thin plot begins to sag. The characters jump from gun battles to exposition, rather than letting the events of the film unfold naturally, so that when you hear the sound of gunfire, you breathe a sigh of relief and think ""at least he stopped talking for five minutes.""It's sad to see Tom Berenger in the film. He just doesn't look well at all. I know he's no longer a youngster, but I can't tell if his appearance is due to illness, plastic surgery, or both. He just doesn't look or sound good at all (although his character IS supposed to be a ""grizzled veteran"" of the N'awlins PD...maybe it's secretly an Oscar-worthy performance with great makeup. I personally think he looks like he's under the weather).The bad guys take Michael Madsen's riff from ""Reservoir Dogs"" and run with it, to new levels of sick extreme. Will it turn you off or make you want to watch the film a second time? You'll know when you see it.Even though the box art carries the four star, ""An Outstanding Action Thriller"" recommendation from ""Film Threat,"" if I wanted that kind of entertainment, I'd probably head to my all-time favorite, the Brian Bosworth / Lance Henriksen biker epicStone Cold, or maybe the aforementioned Lethal Weapon series, or Die Hard, or...And when the movie ends, it's hard to care. The screenwriters / director do their best to wrap a tidy little bow around the preceding 104 minutes but it's very, very hard to care. I'd have to say that this was a mildly amusing film to watch once, but for this kind of entertainment, you have FAR too many other choices...likeSteven Seagal Collection: 4 Film Favorites - Under Siege / The Glimmer Man / Above the Law / Fire Down Below, for instance.Caveat Emptor.",2,Imagine a Steven Seagal movie without Steven Seagal...,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,3308,"['movie', ""n't"", 'shy', 'when', 'showing', 'influences', 'shades', 'ofDirty', 'Harry', 'tough', 'violent', 'cop', 'out', 'tough', 'violent', 'bad', 'guys', 'tough', 'violent', 'manner', 'warned', 'Captain', 'less-than-healthy-looking', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'too', 'far', 'dark', 'side', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Emotionally', 'scarred', 'loner', 'cop', 'teams', 'more', 'stable', 'cop', 'pretty', 'wife', 'great', 'kids', 'even', 'drawn', 'sense', 'family', 'MUST', 'keep', 'hos', 'emotional', 'distance', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'sick', 'twisted', 'malevolence', 'fromReservoir', 'Dogs', 'virtually', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'especially', 'inclusion', 'Russian', 'Mob', 'characters', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'FX', 'Network', 'legendary', 'seriesThe', 'Shield', 'Complete', 'Series', 'not', 'enough', 'set', 'post-Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'New', 'Orleans', 'characters', 'making', 'reference', 'bodies', 'floating', 'one', 'cared', 'sharing', 'how', 'would', 'rather', 'live', 'downtown', 'Baghdad', 'Big', 'Easy.Of', 'course', 'other', 'bowl', 'gumbo', ""'d"", 'better', 'plan', 'chewing', 'few', 'mouthfuls', 'slimy', 'okra', 'hit', 'bottom', 'THIS', 'bowl.The', 'film', 'WANTS', 'star', 'Jimmy', 'Strong', 'be', 'memorable', 'dynamic', 'lead', 'figure', 'elaborate', 'tattoos', 'close-cropped', 'beard', 'consistently', 'deadpan', 'moody', 'demeanor', 'just', 'add', 'up', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'done', 'better', 'Five', 'minutes', 'movie', ""'re"", 'knee-deep', 'first', 'semiautomatic', 'weapon', 'gun', 'battle', 'whip', 'out', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'paper-thin', 'plot', 'sag', 'characters', 'jump', 'gun', 'battles', 'exposition', 'rather', 'letting', 'events', 'film', 'unfold', 'naturally', 'when', 'hear', 'sound', 'gunfire', 'breathe', 'sigh', 'relief', 'think', 'least', 'stopped', 'talking', 'five', 'minutes', 'sad', 'see', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'well', 'know', 'no', 'longer', 'youngster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'appearance', 'due', 'illness', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'sound', 'good', 'character', 'IS', 'supposed', 'be', 'grizzled', 'veteran', ""N'awlins"", 'PD', 'secretly', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'great', 'makeup', 'personally', 'think', 'weather', 'bad', 'guys', 'take', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'riff', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'run', 'new', 'levels', 'sick', 'extreme', 'Will', 'turn', 'off', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'second', 'time', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'it.Even', 'box', 'art', 'four', 'star', 'Outstanding', 'Action', 'Thriller', 'recommendation', 'Film', 'Threat', 'wanted', 'kind', 'entertainment', ""'d"", 'probably', 'head', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Brian', 'Bosworth', '/', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'biker', 'epicStone', 'Cold', 'maybe', 'aforementioned', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'series', 'Die', 'Hard', 'when', 'movie', 'hard', 'care', 'screenwriters', '/', 'director', 'do', 'best', 'wrap', 'tidy', 'little', 'bow', 'preceding', '104', 'minutes', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'care', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'was', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'film', 'watch', 'once', 'kind', 'entertainment', 'have', 'FAR', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'choices', 'likeSteven', 'Seagal', 'Collection', '4', 'Film', 'Favorites', 'Siege', '/', 'Glimmer', 'Man', '/', 'Law', '/', 'Fire', 'Down', 'Below', 'instance.Caveat', 'Emptor']",N/A

The other thing I really enjoyed about the movie is the New Orleans scenery, where this movie is set. Lots of gorgeous overhead shots of the New Orleans downtown and the surrounding areas. Johnny Strong brings a gritty performance as the main character, and Tom Berenger (in a much smaller supporting role) is also quite good as his superior.The other thing (already mentioned by several other reviewers) is that the overall tone of the movie reminded me of previous Michael Mann-directed ""dark"" crime dramas, which is a plus.

1505565,ASY25YMTIC2A9,B005YCEHWQ,Steve,"[0, 3]","I had some high hopes for this movie after reading some reviews on it. Unfortunately, it falls far short of expectations. There are so many things wrong with the movie, I don't even know where to begin. The movie is basically a take-off of Lethal Weapon, with many scenes taken right from that movie. A burnt out cop with nothing to lose and a habit of getting into trouble (Johnny Strong) is paired with a new partner (Kevin Phillips), a black man with a warm loving family, who just want to make it through each day. They must solve a case where people are being burned to death as an 'interrogation' technique by the main villain, who's searching for a video tape.75% of the actors in the movie either didn't take it seriously or just couldn't act. I've never seen Kevin Phillips in any other movie, so I can't attest to his acting skills, however he was AWFUL in this movie. A huge number of the smaller rolls were clearly given to people without a shred of acting experience... it wasn't just 'raw', it was terrible. This leaves the remaining 25% of the actors who either could act or at least tried to act, seem ridiculously out of place in this movie. I was actually embarrassed watching Johnny Strong try to deliver heart-felt lines about his son. It was actually painful to watch. There were also various scenes where they clearly tried to have an 'epic' moment between the villain and good guy... a sit down where they both speak to each other candidly. Think Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in 'Heat', or Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in 'True Romance'. This movie, however, tried at least three times to pull it off, yet it came across terribly each time. The dialog was just stupid, and it was delivered badly.Editing and special effects were also awful. I understand it's a low-budget film, but it was so blatantly obvious in just about every scene in the movie. The action scenes all took place in clearly run-down and abandoned areas, where shooting up a house would be cheapest. There was also a laughable scene where it seemed they merged the morgue with the police department set... like they rolled the corpse to the chief's office. At one point they had a torture scene that should have been horrific, where one of the villains set a man on fire, extinguished him, the re-set him on fire over and over again, to 'scare' another man into talking. Between the poor acting, terrible fire special effects, cheap props, and strange editing effects, my wife and I actually burst out laughing. The scene, which was suppose to be gruesome and scary, was hysterically bad.Another thing to point out is that even the soundtrack was bad... many of the scenes had music played over it that was awkwardly out of place. This was the final touch that made the movie seem like a complete mess. There were numerous scenes that were clearly taken straight from 'Lethal Weapon'... so much so, that I found it annoying. Lastly, the 'suspension of disbelief' that was required to sit through this movie was almost obscene... in one scene, the villain is racing down the street in a car and our two 'heroes' manage to run fast enough to get in front of him... but then, instead of shooting at the car from behind another car, or from the sidewalk, our brilliant heroes stand next to each other in the middle of the street, directly in front of this speeding vehicle, and try to shoot the driver. It doesn't work, as the car plows straight through them and sends them both hurtling through the air. Luckily, the two stumble to their feet, with little more then bruises and cuts.

1505566,ATLA5CJH0ZZHP,B005YCEHWQ,Terry R. Nye,"[1, 1]","This is a surprisingly good action movie.  People are being killed in gruesome ways for reasons that are not immediately understood.  Eventually, it becomes clear that some very bad people are trying to recover a videotape that shows a cold-blooded killing of military personnel by some other military people, although it is never made known why it ever happened in the first place or why the tape was made.  Much of the action involves the bad guys killing people who stand in their way of recovering that tape.  The person who possesses the tape turns out to be a friend of the protagonist of the movie, Sean Riley, who is a very tough New Orleans cop.  Riley is on the verge of suspension for all the people he has killed while dispensing his own brand of street justice.  He makes Dirty Harry seem like a wimp by comparison.  The bad guys make the mistake of killing the brother of a very dangerous gang leader who seeks revenge, which puts an interesting twist in the story that could have been developed more.  Most of the action involves Riley's attempts to stop the killers and prevent his friend from being killed.  The action is graphic, brutal, and almost non-stop.The main problem with this movie is the story is poorly-developed.  The reason for the mysterious tape is never really explained. The main villain has a deadline to deliver the tape to his boss, but there is never any explanation as to who his boss is, why he would care about the tape, and why the military people were executed in the first place.  There are some gun battles that are just not at all believable.  Villains who are supposed to be highly-trained ex-military men are seemingly incapable of killing Riley with machine guns while he dispatches them with ease with his service pistol in several scenes.  In another scene Riley and his partner are hit head-on by a speeding car yet both remain not only alive but are also able to get back up and walk as though they were only bruised up a little bit.  There is a lot of gritty, sadistic violence that may be offensive to some people.Fans of action movies with lots of violence who really don't care about a realistic or meaningful story will probably like this movie.  Sean Riley is a great action hero, and a sequel would be welcome with a better screenplay to flesh out the story and characters better.",3,"plenty of action, not much story",1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,2341,"['surprisingly', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'People', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'gruesome', 'ways', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'immediately', 'understood', 'Eventually', 'clear', 'very', 'bad', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'recover', 'videotape', 'cold-blooded', 'killing', 'military', 'personnel', 'other', 'military', 'people', 'never', 'made', 'known', 'why', 'ever', 'happened', 'first', 'place', 'why', 'tape', 'was', 'made', 'Much', 'action', 'bad', 'guys', 'killing', 'people', 'who', 'stand', 'way', 'recovering', 'tape', 'person', 'who', 'tape', 'out', 'be', 'friend', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'Sean', 'Riley', 'who', 'very', 'tough', 'New', 'Orleans', 'cop', 'Riley', 'verge', 'suspension', 'people', 'killed', 'dispensing', 'own', 'brand', 'street', 'justice', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'seem', 'wimp', 'comparison', 'bad', 'guys', 'make', 'mistake', 'killing', 'brother', 'very', 'dangerous', 'gang', 'leader', 'who', 'revenge', 'interesting', 'twist', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'Most', 'action', 'Riley', 'attempts', 'stop', 'killers', 'prevent', 'friend', 'being', 'killed', 'action', 'graphic', 'brutal', 'almost', 'non-stop.The', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'story', 'poorly-developed', 'reason', 'mysterious', 'tape', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'main', 'villain', 'deadline', 'deliver', 'tape', 'boss', 'never', 'explanation', 'who', 'boss', 'why', 'would', 'care', 'tape', 'why', 'military', 'people', 'were', 'executed', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'gun', 'battles', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'Villains', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'highly-trained', 'ex-military', 'men', 'are', 'seemingly', 'incapable', 'killing', 'Riley', 'machine', 'guns', 'ease', 'service', 'pistol', 'several', 'scenes', 'scene', 'Riley', 'partner', 'are', 'hit', 'head-on', 'speeding', 'car', 'yet', 'remain', 'not', 'only', 'alive', 'are', 'also', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'walk', 'were', 'only', 'bruised', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'lot', 'gritty', 'sadistic', 'violence', 'may', 'be', 'offensive', 'people.Fans', 'action', 'movies', 'lots', 'violence', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'realistic', 'meaningful', 'story', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', 'Sean', 'Riley', 'great', 'action', 'hero', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'better', 'screenplay', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'characters', 'better']",N/A

As leader of an elite street crimes task force squad, Detective Sean Reilly (Johnny Strong) is trying to cope with the death of his young son and the abandonment of his wife.  When a routine warrant service results in an ambush and the vicious murder of his partner, this might be the last straw for Sean.  Reassigned by his mentor, Capt. Trahan (Tom Berenger), Sean and Det. Will Ganz (Kevin Phillips) investigate a baffling gangland homicide.As the clues pile up, Sean and Will realize that Colin (Sean Patrick Flanery), one of Sean's childhood friends, and a security contractor just back from the Middle East, seems to be at the center of the horrible case.  The two quickly realize there is something far more sinister going on than either could ever have imagined.Though director William Kaufman incorporates many familiar elements into this cop thriller, he manages to transcend mere cliche and has crafted an exciting picture.  Location filming on the ravaged streets of New Orleans give the movie a gritty tone.  Be warned: many scenes in this strong R-rated feature are graphically violent.

He has a marriage that has gone south after the untimely death of his son through cancer, he is not afraid to break the rules and survives on his wits and prescription drugs. Basically he is a `cop on the edge' and I don't mean the guitarist from U2.It kicks off as it means to go on with a full on shoot out involving some low life types who are holed up in a clap board house - and like the There Little Pigs, they should have gone for bricks, as all hell breaks loose. His partner gets hit and post shoot out he is paired up with Detective Will Gantz - Kevin Phillips (`Notorious'). Things take a turn for the nasty when a series of brutal torture slayings start to happen. Add to the mix Sean's old army buddy, Colin (Sean Patrick Flannery of `The Boondock Saints' - cult classic) who lets them know this is more than they can handle. As a full scale gang war kicks off things then really start to heat up. We also have Internal Affairs looking into some questionable tactics that Riley may have used in the past.Where this really scores though is the action, it is done realistically and has a bullet count that `The A Team' would have been proud of, but these bullets actually do hit their targets. The acting is all top rate if a tad sensational at points, the clich&eacute;s are all believable and the special effects really work. For movie anoraks also spot the bar they use is called The Boondock saint as an homage to Sean Patrick Flannery and that film, which is a must se by the way.This then is 100 minutes of cop action, released as `Bad Cop' in the UK, where the stereo types line up to be counted and are not found wanting, Will Kaufman has done a really good job of getting the most from the actors and from a less than original script and it all really works. - this may be far from genre breaking but I think it is genre enhancing.",4,"Guns, Violence, Bullets, Torture, Lead and Guns all set in Mofo Orleans!",1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,2061,"['film', 'writer', 'director', 'Will', 'Kaufman', 'Prodigy', 'set', 'seedy', 'underworld', 'New', 'Orleans', 'stars', 'Johnny', 'Strong', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Detective', 'Sean', 'Riley', 'marriage', 'gone', 'south', 'untimely', 'death', 'son', 'cancer', 'not', 'afraid', 'break', 'rules', 'survives', 'wits', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'Basically', 'cop', 'edge', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'guitarist', 'U2.It', 'off', 'go', 'full', 'shoot', 'out', 'involving', 'low', 'life', 'types', 'who', 'are', 'holed', 'up', 'clap', 'board', 'house', 'Little', 'Pigs', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'bricks', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'partner', 'hit', 'post', 'shoot', 'paired', 'up', 'Detective', 'Will', 'Gantz', 'Kevin', 'Phillips', 'Notorious', 'Things', 'take', 'turn', 'nasty', 'when', 'series', 'brutal', 'torture', 'slayings', 'start', 'happen', 'Add', 'mix', 'Sean', 'old', 'army', 'buddy', 'Colin', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'cult', 'classic', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'can', 'handle', 'full', 'scale', 'gang', 'war', 'off', 'things', 'then', 'really', 'start', 'heat', 'up', 'also', 'have', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'looking', 'questionable', 'tactics', 'Riley', 'may', 'have', 'used', 'past.Where', 'really', 'action', 'done', 'realistically', 'bullet', 'count', 'A', 'Team', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud', 'bullets', 'actually', 'do', 'hit', 'targets', 'acting', 'top', 'rate', 'tad', 'sensational', 'points', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'believable', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'work', 'movie', 'anoraks', 'also', 'spot', 'bar', 'use', 'called', 'Boondock', 'saint', 'homage', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'film', 'must', 'se', 'way.This', 'then', '100', 'minutes', 'cop', 'action', 'released', 'Bad', 'Cop', 'UK', 'where', 'stereo', 'types', 'line', 'be', 'counted', 'are', 'not', 'found', 'wanting', 'Will', 'Kaufman', 'done', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'getting', 'most', 'actors', 'less', 'original', 'script', 'really', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'genre', 'breaking', 'think', 'genre', 'enhancing']",N/A

1505570,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B005YCEHWQ,trashcanman,"[1, 2]","""Sinners and Saints"" is a violent action flick taking place in a post-Katrina New Orleans overrun with organized crime.  It's not really outstanding film in an already overstuffed film genre, but it will no doubt please action genre fans and does an impressive job of maximizing it's small budget with very high production values.The story focuses on the classic ""man with nothing left to lose"", in this case a police officer whose aggressive tactics (and bad luck) land him in hot water with Internal Affairs as he investigates a set of particularly cruel gangland murders.  The cast is surprisingly solid in spite of the names most likely to generate interest (rapper Method Man, MMA legend Bas Rutten, sizzling hot Jolene Blalock, and Sean Patrick Flanery of Boondock Saints) having tiny roles.  While I'm still waiting for Bas to get a leading role and become the new Van Damme (seriously, watch an episode of Punk Payback and tell me that dude shouldn't be a star) Johnny Strong and Kevin Phillips keep an otherwise over-the-top action flick very down to earth with believable everyman performances as the film's leads.  Strong's character's protectiveness of his partner's perfect family life is rocking some bromance vibes, but it's never portrayed as sappy so much as a man seeking to vicariously protect what he has already lost himself.  That's something I think most of us will be able to relate to on some level, and it's part of what makes this film a bit better than an average straight-to-dvd action movie.Now, I'm not a huge fan of buddy cop flicks or crime movies, but I enjoyed Sinners and Saints in spite of that fact.  The violence here is plentiful, the performances are good, and the story is interesting if not exceptionally well-told.
