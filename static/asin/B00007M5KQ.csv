732236,AE2D8BPIT6NGU,B00007M5KQ,"Bruce Bain ""Romans 9:33/Remember Jackie Robinson""","[1, 2]","To study  the Triangle Trade of Slavery, I have viewed four popular films for comparison, to see which gives the best visual presentation of the practice.  I need to find cinematic accounts which showed all stages of the trade, from the capture of Africans, to their holding in the infamous dungeons on the West Coast of Africa, to their journeys on the ships which would last from three weeks on a fast journey, to as many as five weeks on a storm-driven sea,  to their lives on the Sugar  Cane Plantations and the Cotton Plantations in The West Indies and American.""Sankofa"" was overwhelmingly the best, because it shows the most and most extensive of these accounts.""Amistad"" is a close second, and also, the account is much briefer, and it fails to show the slave's life on a plantation at all as forced labor.""The Middle Passage is  basically,  nothing more than a lengthy depiction of the journey on the slaves ships.It is informative,  but only in that it shows extended passages of the slaves  rocking back and forth in cramped conditions,  along with some suicides and the natural deaths due to disease in which the bodies are thrown overboard.It shows slaves being brought up above decks, forced to run in circles for washing and exercise, being driven by whipping.That is about all that  the entire movie is about.  It ends when the ships  comes within site of land at the western end of the slave ship's journey.  The film features extensive and heavy narration, by the one slave  who is giving the account of all that is occurring, combined with many flashbacks which show that the slaves  had their own religion, there own happy villages, and happy family life and culture.In all however,  this was the least informative, as  ""Amistad""  was,  though briefer,  far more graphic in its accounts of the violence done to the slaves on board the ships.""Amazing Grace"" is the account of the abolitionist movement in England, and only shows  in a general way, the abuses of the Slave Trade. It is however, informative of how the political process was used to terminate the slave trade by English Law.""The Middle Passage""  features long passages in which we are left to dwell on either the images of Sky, or the ships rigging or sails during the narrative of the speaking slave, and this is  unfortunately,  insufficient to convey the idea of suffering.Sure, the brutality is there, but presented  ""dully"".  It remains however,  something of an informative film....",3,"Not as informative  as ""Sankofa"" or ""Amistad""",1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,2471,"['study', 'Triangle', 'Trade', 'Slavery', 'have', 'viewed', 'four', 'popular', 'films', 'comparison', 'see', 'best', 'visual', 'presentation', 'practice', 'need', 'find', 'cinematic', 'accounts', 'showed', 'stages', 'trade', 'capture', 'Africans', 'holding', 'infamous', 'dungeons', 'West', 'Coast', 'Africa', 'journeys', 'ships', 'would', 'last', 'three', 'weeks', 'fast', 'journey', 'as', 'many', 'five', 'weeks', 'storm-driven', 'sea', 'lives', 'Sugar', 'Cane', 'Plantations', 'Cotton', 'Plantations', 'West', 'Indies', 'American', 'Sankofa', 'was', 'overwhelmingly', 'best', 'most', 'most', 'extensive', 'accounts', 'Amistad', 'close', 'second', 'also', 'account', 'much', 'briefer', 'show', 'slave', 'life', 'plantation', 'as', 'forced', 'labor', 'Middle', 'Passage', 'basically', 'nothing', 'more', 'lengthy', 'depiction', 'journey', 'slaves', 'ships.It', 'informative', 'only', 'extended', 'passages', 'slaves', 'rocking', 'back', 'forth', 'cramped', 'conditions', 'suicides', 'natural', 'deaths', 'due', 'disease', 'bodies', 'are', 'thrown', 'overboard.It', 'slaves', 'being', 'brought', 'up', 'decks', 'forced', 'run', 'circles', 'washing', 'exercise', 'being', 'driven', 'whipping.That', 'entire', 'movie', 'about', 'when', 'ships', 'site', 'land', 'western', 'end', 'slave', 'ship', 'journey', 'film', 'features', 'extensive', 'heavy', 'narration', 'one', 'slave', 'who', 'giving', 'account', 'occurring', 'combined', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'show', 'slaves', 'had', 'own', 'religion', 'own', 'happy', 'villages', 'happy', 'family', 'life', 'culture.In', 'however', 'was', 'least', 'informative', 'Amistad', 'was', 'briefer', 'far', 'more', 'graphic', 'accounts', 'violence', 'done', 'slaves', 'board', 'ships', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'account', 'abolitionist', 'movement', 'England', 'only', 'general', 'way', 'abuses', 'Slave', 'Trade', 'however', 'informative', 'how', 'political', 'process', 'was', 'used', 'terminate', 'slave', 'trade', 'English', 'Law', 'Middle', 'Passage', 'features', 'long', 'passages', 'are', 'left', 'dwell', 'images', 'Sky', 'ships', 'rigging', 'sails', 'narrative', 'speaking', 'slave', 'unfortunately', 'insufficient', 'convey', 'idea', 'suffering.Sure', 'brutality', 'there', 'presented', 'dully', 'however', 'something', 'informative', 'film']",The Middle Passage
732237,A28QTPX9HWBVMU,B00007M5KQ,"D. Milburn ""davart1""","[4, 8]","The rather flat narration and slow cinematography made this a difficult film to keep your attention. It is true that the slave-trading era is a dark book in human history that dates back 1000's of years and continues to this day in some cultures. The height of African slave trade to the New World was between the 17th and 18th century. I had hope this film effort would be an educational and informative film, but came across more as a grasp for pity more so than opportunity to enlighten and educate. While very loosely based in hard cold facts, much license has been taken with the facts. Many events appear to have come from numerous ships logs are compiled into one ships journey giving the impression of great suffering on a single voyage. Not to minimize the suffering that did take place on these voyages one must note that little tidbit of information for relevance. Slave ships were horrid places and the average slave had less than 2 square feet of space, less on some vessels. The treatment and mortality rate was appalling, was cramped beyond comprehension and little to no food and water during their crossing. There are many excellent writing of the period on the conditions and events on these ships and are far more informative and true to fact than this production. Primarily from the writing of inspectors that patrolled the seas after the band on slave trading in 1807 (Britain) and 1808 (US). These inspectors account the conditions, treatment and savagery on these vessels\. I would recommend those as opposed to this. Since nearly all victims of the slave trade where illiterate and had no written language little is known of their suffering from their eyes and words, so much poetic license and projection is being made as to the true events. The important point I'm making is that this is a movies is very loosely based on many real events, but it is not to be taken as literal history that would be a grave error. The opportunity to make a truly impacting informative educational film here that reflected the mistreatment and suffering of these people was missed. I would very highly recommend that if you are an educator and plan to show this film as part of a history class, please arm yourself with knowledge first as little is to be found within this work.",2,A great opportunity to educate missed.,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2286,"['rather', 'flat', 'narration', 'slow', 'cinematography', 'made', 'difficult', 'film', 'keep', 'attention', 'true', 'slave-trading', 'era', 'dark', 'book', 'human', 'history', 'back', '1000', 'years', 'day', 'cultures', 'height', 'African', 'slave', 'trade', 'New', 'World', 'was', '17th', '18th', 'century', 'had', 'hope', 'film', 'effort', 'would', 'be', 'educational', 'informative', 'film', 'came', 'across', 'more', 'grasp', 'pity', 'more', 'so', 'opportunity', 'enlighten', 'educate', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'hard', 'cold', 'facts', 'much', 'license', 'been', 'taken', 'facts', 'Many', 'events', 'appear', 'have', 'come', 'numerous', 'ships', 'logs', 'are', 'compiled', 'one', 'ships', 'journey', 'giving', 'impression', 'great', 'suffering', 'single', 'voyage', 'Not', 'minimize', 'suffering', 'did', 'take', 'place', 'voyages', 'one', 'must', 'note', 'little', 'tidbit', 'information', 'relevance', 'Slave', 'ships', 'were', 'horrid', 'places', 'average', 'slave', 'had', 'less', '2', 'square', 'feet', 'space', 'less', 'vessels', 'treatment', 'mortality', 'rate', 'was', 'appalling', 'was', 'cramped', 'comprehension', 'little', 'food', 'water', 'crossing', 'are', 'many', 'excellent', 'writing', 'period', 'conditions', 'events', 'ships', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'informative', 'true', 'fact', 'production', 'Primarily', 'writing', 'inspectors', 'patrolled', 'seas', 'band', 'slave', 'trading', '1807', 'Britain', '1808', 'US', 'inspectors', 'account', 'conditions', 'treatment', 'savagery', 'vessels\\', 'would', 'recommend', 'opposed', 'nearly', 'victims', 'slave', 'trade', 'where', 'illiterate', 'had', 'written', 'language', 'little', 'known', 'suffering', 'eyes', 'words', 'so', 'much', 'poetic', 'license', 'projection', 'being', 'made', 'true', 'events', 'important', 'point', ""'m"", 'making', 'movies', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'many', 'real', 'events', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'literal', 'history', 'would', 'be', 'grave', 'error', 'opportunity', 'make', 'truly', 'impacting', 'informative', 'educational', 'film', 'here', 'reflected', 'mistreatment', 'suffering', 'people', 'was', 'missed', 'would', 'very', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'educator', 'plan', 'show', 'film', 'part', 'history', 'class', 'please', 'arm', 'knowledge', 'first', 'as', 'little', 'be', 'found', 'work']",The Middle Passage
732238,A38J9KTPWDG6SI,B00007M5KQ,"J. Powell ""Jimbo""","[2, 4]","This excellent film shows the true horror of slavery vivdly to life in excruciating detail. The subject of slavery is still rarely looked at in any detail by mainstream TV or Hollywood media and with a very good reason. The world wants to just forget the fact that literally millions died for the simple reason to make money for lazy white people who professed to be ""Christian"". The United States was built upon slave labor, but nobody wants to talk about it too much. Unlike the Jewish holocaust of the Second World War, slavery has been put aside and largely forgotten about. Yet the fact remains that as many, and possibly more people died during the middle passage as in the concentration camps like Auschwitz. The genocide inflicted had no concern or common decency for fellow humans, because the enslavers did not consider AFRICANS TO BE HUMAN!This film is fairly short, just over an hour, but more than gets it's point across in that timespan. The lovely cinematography adds to the dark and brooding subject. Slaves are shown in the hold of the ship, sweating in the miserable dank darkness, infested with rats, near starving and treated with contempt and brutality. All of them are longing for home and terrified of their futures.There is no dialogue at all between the actors, but the eloquent and powerful first-person narrative of a slave's emotional turmoil and descriptions of his experiences is read over the soundtrack throughout the movie.It's a powerful and heartbreaking insight into just what slavery was and how it must have felt to be kidnapped and sold into slavery, and the degradation and horror of what awaited them. This is a very depressing movie but a realistic one. It was depressing, ugly and inhuman. Slavery was one of the low points in the entire history of mankind and the depths of man's inhumanity to fellow man should nver be forgotten...ever.",4,the greatest genocide of all - vividly brought to life,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,1881,"['excellent', 'film', 'true', 'horror', 'slavery', 'vivdly', 'life', 'excruciating', 'detail', 'subject', 'slavery', 'still', 'rarely', 'looked', 'detail', 'mainstream', 'TV', 'Hollywood', 'media', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'world', 'just', 'forget', 'fact', 'literally', 'millions', 'died', 'simple', 'reason', 'make', 'money', 'lazy', 'white', 'people', 'who', 'professed', 'be', 'Christian', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'built', 'slave', 'labor', 'nobody', 'talk', 'too', 'much', 'Jewish', 'holocaust', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'slavery', 'been', 'put', 'aside', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'fact', 'as', 'many', 'possibly', 'more', 'people', 'died', 'middle', 'passage', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Auschwitz', 'genocide', 'inflicted', 'had', 'concern', 'common', 'decency', 'fellow', 'humans', 'enslavers', 'did', 'not', 'consider', 'AFRICANS', 'TO', 'BE', 'HUMAN', 'film', 'fairly', 'short', 'just', 'hour', 'more', 'point', 'across', 'timespan', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'dark', 'brooding', 'subject', 'Slaves', 'are', 'shown', 'hold', 'ship', 'sweating', 'miserable', 'dank', 'darkness', 'infested', 'rats', 'starving', 'treated', 'contempt', 'brutality', 'are', 'longing', 'home', 'terrified', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'eloquent', 'powerful', 'first-person', 'narrative', 'slave', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'descriptions', 'experiences', 'read', 'soundtrack', 'movie.It', 'powerful', 'heartbreaking', 'insight', 'just', 'what', 'slavery', 'was', 'how', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'be', 'kidnapped', 'sold', 'slavery', 'degradation', 'horror', 'what', 'awaited', 'very', 'depressing', 'movie', 'realistic', 'one', 'was', 'depressing', 'ugly', 'inhuman', 'Slavery', 'was', 'one', 'low', 'points', 'entire', 'history', 'mankind', 'depths', 'man', 'inhumanity', 'fellow', 'man', 'should', 'nver', 'be', 'forgotten', 'ever']",The Middle Passage

That can be good, however, and a film like this is guaranteed to ignite some serious discussion. Depictions of the Middle Passage are starkly realistic here and not for the queasy. Unfortunately, the film is also painfully slow, despite a carefully composed, well-delivered narration and some excellent cinematography. Even the many interesting references to indigenous West African religion can't seem to pick up the pace.
