The only one I'm familiar with, Bob Odenkirk, co-hosted the HBO sketch comedy series,MR.

Seems promising, but then....After reading several reviews I see now why it's so low rated: the film is merely a bunch of scatological scenarios, one more gross than the other. It's the sort of picture you either love, perhaps because you were stoned when watching it, or hate, because the film is meant to offend the sensibilities and succeeds.Well, I wasn't high when ""43"" ran on my laptop PC and I do have my standards.

Here is the only plausible theory that me, 43 NASA scientists, and a supercomputer came up with:Hugh Jackman's house was invaded, and his family was held at gunpoint to force him to do the film. Liev Schrieber, Naomi Watts, and Kate Winslet were sent fake scripts, and held hostage at gunpoint to prevent them from escaping from the film set. Emma Stone, Gerard Butler, and Chloe Grace Moretz were heavily drugged. Dennis Quaid was under hypnotic influence, as was Uma Thurman. Halle Berry was told to do the film or they would make a sequel to Catwoman. Faced with an impossible choice, she did what anyone would do. Movie 43 makes Catwoman look like The Dark Knight. Christopher Mintze-Plasse, Anna Faris, and Terrence Howard were blackmailed.That is all I can come up with. This trash has no redeeming factors. None at all.It is unfunny, stupid, filthy, disgusting, perverted garbage.On behalf of the many unfortunate souls who did not know what they were getting into when they saw this movie (if it can even be called that), I say this:DO NOT. WATCH. IT.As for my rating for this film, imagine the lowest, smallest number you can, multiply that by 6, take that number down 14 notches, and times that by 43.

1636007,ALZUXIRR1BVV0,B00BN3ED8I,Deej,"[0, 1]","First thing, I am NOT a fan of potty and profanity type humour. That's why this movie really suprised me. It's got a great cast and is suprisingly well directed. Yes, it's crude, very crude, with themes of the afore mentioned potty humour and profanity, as well as sex, violence, periods, and a whole bunch of other stuff. However, behind all that, it is actually well written in parts. My favourites being the sketch where the girl from Kick Ass (the main one) is around her boyfriends house and she tries to get away or at least hide the fact that she just had her first period. She then gets surrounded by various male characters (her boyfriend, boyfriend's older brother, boyfriend's dad and her dad) who haven't a clue what to do and try to help her in a sterotypically male way, which makes for some good laughs and highlights the sterotype of how males don't have a clue about periods. Another good one is the last one with Elizabeth Banks and the rivalry she has with her boyfriend's male cat, for the boyfriend's affections. The cat itself is a cartoon, quite literally. Sick and strange but still funny with a deliciously dark ending. The blind date one with Halle Berry and the co-writer of the British version of the Office (not Ricky Gervais) gets pretty crazy but still amusing as they get each other to do outlandish dares.Overall, yes it's extreme and the gags and themes are crudely out there. If you get easily offended by anything I have mentioned, avoid this. If you like Jackass, Seth Mcfarlane stuff, Farrely Brothers (Peter Farrely- Something about Mary, co-made this), crude stand up comics and dark humour (like in Kick Ass), with a bit of Kevin Smith thrown in, think you'll like it. Yes, there are some bad sketches amongst the better ones and it would have been a better movie it was a little less Seth Mcfarlane and more Kevin Smith, but it isn't. Still, it's good for a few laughs, and if like me, you generally don't like potty humour but enjoy gags that sterotype people, dark humour, spook, satire, observational comedy and don't mind swearing, then give it a go, because some of the writing is defintitely clever. I think the level of grossness in this, clouds the fact that it does contain some clever writing, at least for the better sketches. I guess it is possible to be clever and disgusting. Just don't watch it with kids or easily offended people.

The fact that there are so many Hollywood big-shots in parodies of their typical roles adds a great deal to this little batch of spoofs. There's a lot of gross humor, of course: Scat, mutilation, body parts, etc, but to my pleasant surprise, MOVIE 43 doesn't feel the need to just rub its audience's face in these elements, making its point without showing TOO much nauseating stuff. {Fans of nauseating stuff will definitely find some here, but they may be disappointed that it doesn't go farther.}The biggest problem is that it's nowhere near as developed and focused as it could be, and virtually all the scenes, many of which would be worth entire films unto themselves, end just as they start to get interesting. But maybe that's the point because, as the young aspiring filmmakers in the central story attest, the biggest thing this film seems to be parodying is today's lazily produced low budget films (premature credits rolling at 76 minutes, etc).Though it's far from great, there are definitely some things to appreciate here. MOVIE 43 is disorganized and underdone, but even in those respects, it still works (kind of).

I actually attempted to write a review of this.....thing I am supposed to call a film, but I thought it would be take too much time from actually writing my opinion on the film. So, to those who wish to know who had their involvement in this film, go to Wikipedia, IMDB or any similar website that provides film information. As for the film itself.....where, oh where to begin?Movie 43 began its small, pitiful life as an idea from one of its producers, Charles B. Wessler. Wessler's work is more well known as a right hand man of sorts to the Farrelly Brothers, the one-hit wonders behind such works such as There's Something About Marry and Kingpin. It was to be an all ensemble cast of the funniest minds in Hollywood of writers, directors, actors and actresses, all being incredibly silly and funny. The project kept on going through all sorts of development troubles, with it being constantly started up, then stopped and so on and so forth. Eventually, the film was able to finally see the light of day in early 2013, released during a time when pretty much nothing is coming out (e.g. January) and how did the film do? Well, it made money (29 million world wide on a 6 million dollar budget), but as evidenced by films like Transformers Revenge of The Fallen and The Devil Inside, just because it made money doesn't mean its good.Thanks to Movie 43, we can now say that films with all star casts are no long a surefire thing that the film is of any excellent quality. Now, to summarize the plot of Movie 43 can be somewhat of an exercise in futility, but I shall do the best I can. There are two different versions of the film that exist, with a different segment that ties all of these together, so I shall go with the one I had seen. Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid) is attempting to greenlight multiple script ideas to film producer Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinneer). Wessler even resorts to threatening others at gun point to get his ideas off the ground. The film shows us Wessler's harebrained ideas on screen which include the following:- A segment in which Kate Winslet goes a on a blind date with Hugh Jackman who has a pair of testicles on his neck.- Two parents, played by actual couple Liev Screiber and Naomi Watts, decide to homeschool their son, played by Jeremy Allen White, while also putting him through all the humiliating things a kid might experience during high school.- Johnny Knoxville decides to get his best friend, played by Sean William Scott, a Leprechaun played by Gerard Butler for his birthday in an attempt to get his gold. Gratuitous violence and swearing ensues.- Justin Long plays Robin from the DC Comics, who goes on speed dating with the help of Batman, played by Jason Sudeikis.- Anna Faris is going on a date with Chris Pratt and to celebrate their relationship, she wants Pratt to s***on her. Pratt's character then eats a grotesque amount of stomach rupturing food to do so.And so on and so forth.Now, I have seen some utterly revolting works in my time, both in the positive sense and negative. Stuff that most mainstream audiences would shun away from that select audiences and I would get massive enjoyment from. On the positive sense, I've sat through the works of directors like Lars von Trier, Takashi Miike, Park Chain Wook, Darren Aronofsky - Directors who push the boundaries of filmmaking that can both make the audience cringe to hell and back while challenging the way think and see film. On the negative sense, I've sat through the bottom of the barrel when it comes to filmmaking such as the works of Jason Friedberg And Aaron Seltzer, some of the works from Michael Bay and Uwe Boll. But even all of those filmmakers I just listed, even the bad ones, would be possibly terrified by what has been put on display here.The film apparently runs 94 minutes over here in the States, but what  should have felt like a quick and painless routine became more or less an eternity, like being thrown into a black hole that traveled at an incredibly slow rate whilst taking a lot of psychoactive drugs. Every single segment that would constantly be thrown at me wasn't in singular sense funny, amusing, creative or even off the track. Instead, they were lazy, stupid, unfunny, poorly paced, insulting and any and every single word from any kind of dictionary, whether it'd be in English or whatever kind of foreign language out there.All of the film's participants make absolute fools of themselves in this film and not in a funny way. For example, the aforementioned part when Wolverine has balls on his neck? The entire gag comes off as someone going like ""TEE HEE HEE HEE! LOOK! HE'S GOT BALLS ON HIS NECK! NO ONE ISN'T NOTICING IT EXCEPT FOR HIS DATE! HIS PUBES JUST DROPPED INTO HIS SOUP! ISN'T THAT FUNNY?"" Yeah, it'd be funny if there was more jokes surrounding it outside of an insipid gag that goes on for far too long. There's also the ""Poop"" segment I mentioned, in which when it hits its gastric crescendo, has this utterly ugly and mean spirited vibe to it. You feel absolutely dirty watching the damn thing.Hell, even from the stills or watching a trailer, you can tell that this film was cheap to make. Everything has this slightly icky feel to them when watching, like the camera they were using was something you'd get at a cheap ass garage sale than a Hollywood production. I have seen films that cost less that what Movie 43 did that look much more polished and have more effort in them than what this Hollywood infested pierce of garbage looks like. A film like Moon, which costed 1 million less than this, has utterly stunning effects, set and costume design and a bunch creativity behind it. This, on the other hand, does not have ANY of these qualities what so ever!For those who will probably say to me that I don't ""Have a sense of humor"" or ""Not every film is 2001"", allow me to say this in response: For starters, I never bothered to watch the rest of 2001. I liked what I saw, but I never bothered to get around to it. Secondly, I have enjoyed really dumb comedies before. The Razzie Award winning Freddy Got Fingered, co-written, directed and starring Tom Green, is utterly repulsive by regular standards but I find it to be quite creative and strangely amusing. There is some genuine creativity behind the film, such as the film infamous ""Daddy Would You Like Some Sausage"" part, in which Tom Green constructs a system to play the piano while eating Sausages tied up on a series of strings. But there isn't a scene in Movie 43 that made me feel this way.Admittedly, I do have a degree of sympathy for those who participated in the film. Apparently, a lot of the cast was just pretty much suckered into the picture, guilt tripped or outright manipulated by the film's producers. For example, Richard Gere did not want to be in his sketch in which he runs an Apple-like corporation that sells i-pods in the shape of fully grown naked Women. He said he couldn't come to the set, so the filmmakers brought the set to him. Other actors and directors also got a chance to get out of this mess, such as Sam Rockwell, who choose Seven Psychopaths over this or George Clooney, who pretty much told them ""No f***ing way"".I'm not the kind of person who goes out of their to insult others because of their taste in film or anything in terms of art or media. It is a pet peeve of mine, ever since I saw Bob ""Moviebob"" Chipman from The Escapist act like a childish brat over people seeing The Expendables over Scott Pilgrim vs The World. It's not a good character trait and can make you look like an ass. But, as much as I hate saying this and I will not take back what I have said, I must confess: If you think films like Man of Steel, Star Trek Into Darkness or any other big-budget, over-the top, over produced blockbuster is the worse thing you've seen this year without haven't seen this or some kind of insult to cinema, I only have one thing to say:You have no spine. You wouldn't know a bad movie if it came along and presented itself in all of its vacuous glory. You should be lucky to watch anything instead of this. Movie 43 is the epitome of utterly vacuous, disgusting and tasteless filmmaking. It is the worst film of this year, the worst film of this young decade so far and easily one of the worst films ever conceived by the Hollywood system.I HATED IT.",1,You should be ashamed of

Did none of these fine actors read the script - or at least have agents to do it for them and thus warn them off the project?

If you've seen 'Kentucky Fried Movie', and liked it, this is a hyped-up, jacked-on-crack, 2013 version of the same film - or, more accurately, a series of short (sometimes very short), interconnected and usually unrelated short films, with a wraparound story interspersed in between them to try and hold the ""storyline"" (of which there really isn't one) together.For the American release, the wraparound story is ""The Pitch"", where a down-and-out film producer (Dennis Quaid) tries to pitch his crazy-assed movie idea to a studio head (Greg Kinnear).  This is NOT the version I saw (from what I've read, I caught the version that was released internationally), and I'm sort of glad because the wraparound story on the version I saw - about three geeks, two of whom trick the third into looking for the mysterious (even deadly) 'Movie 43' online - was fairly hilarious, and seemed to fit the idea of why there were a bunch of short films looped together in a more logical way.The shorts themselves, good GOD what a cast!  Throughout the film you will see no less than Kate Winslet, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Anna Faris, Chris Pratt, Kieran Culkin, Emma Stone, Richard Gere, Kate Bosworth, Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts, Justin Long, Uma Thurman, Jason Sudeikis, Kristen Bell, Bobby Cannavale, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Chloe Grace Moretz, Gerard Butler, Seann William Scott, Terrence Howard and others doing and saying things you may NEVER have thought you'd see on film!  Indeed, if you gross out easily or are easily offended, this for sure is NOT the film for you.  Conversely, if you have an open mind and a sense of humor that sometimes lends to the bizarre, some of the shorts in this film are laugh-out-loud funny, and worth wading through some of the lamer segments to get to.  Not everything works here, by any means, but enough does to make it worth watching.  Just be forewarned - the humor here is VERY adult (in content; in maturity level it sometimes sinks to ""neanderthal"" for sure), and VERY bizarre.

Plus the skit goes on for many minutes. The first skit's joke is basically ""I can't stop staring at his mole"" but a blue version.

Sargent""","[0, 2]","[Forgive me if I misspell some of the performers names.]Dennis Quaid is a crazed author of a series of skits (and commercials for some reason) he is pushing (forcefully) to Greg Kinnear, a film mogul. This is the thread that runs throughout the entire film as a base theme. I was bowled-over by the cast of this film. I didn't know much about it until I saw it, but I enjoyed much of it. There are definitely parts that fall flat or even a bit lower, but more than 1/2 the film is so outrageous and over-the-top that it's damn funny. The writers definitely went for the sicko concepts, most of which they couldn't get on TV today, despite Seth MacFarlane, the king of bizarre/offensive humor being in the film as himself.Hugh Jackman on a blind date with a beautiful woman in a fancy restaurant has a normal-sized scrotum growing under his chin. The poor woman tries to be cool, but it's pretty hard. That was a funny sketch.There's a sketch about what could happen if home schooling were taken to the extreme that's pretty funny.The skit with Hali Berri is weird funny. She and her date do some unthinkable things to themselves when they engage in a serious game of Truth or Dare.These three sketches along with some of the segments that return to Quaid's increasingly forceful (guns and gernade anyone?) attempts to sell his script are the highlights of the film for me.The late &#34;Tony Soprano&#34; makes a cameo as a security guard Dennis Quaid had to &#34;blow&#34; (against the guard's will no less) to get on the movie lot in the first place.The fake commercials and final sketch about a black basketball team afraid to play their first white opponents have a few chuckles but don't really work very well.This film has been compared to &#34;Kentucky Fried Movie,&#34; a disconnected string of comedy sketches done in, I believe, the early 1980s, but this film is MUCH more amusing than &#34;Kentucky Fried Movie,&#34; which contains only about 10 minutes of really funny material.If you have a really twisted sense of humor like I do, you'll enjoy this movie despite its shortcomings. It's crass, gross and is rarely &#34;tasteful&#34; in the least. If that sounds like fun to you, give this film a try. There are parts you will definitely want to share with your friends as they won't believe you without proof.

1636120,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00BN3ED8I,Westley,"[1, 2]","""Movie 43"" looked so promising, with a massive star-filled cast; I was hoping for an updated ""Kentucky Fried Movie.""  It ended up more of a turkey, unfortunately.  I knew that the movie had received terrible ratings, but as a huge fan of Kate Winslet (as well as a few of the other stars, including Naomi, Watts, Emma Stone, Chris Pratt, and Kieran Culkin), I still had to see this movie.The movie is divided into 10 skits, 3 commercials, and a wrap-around skit that tries to tie everything together.  The wrap-around stars Greg Kinnear as a movie executive and Dennis Quaid (who looks extremely leathery here) as a producer trying to pitch picture ideas.  The ""ideas"" are the skits, although most of them make no sense as actual movies, and how the commercials fit into this concept is never explained.  A few of the skits elicit chuckles; however, most of them completely bomb and/or are jaw-droppingly raunchy.  I have nothing against raunchiness, but it has to be funny.The movie starts off fine with the first skit, featuring Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman on a blind date.  Kate cannot figure out why the dazzling Hugh is still single, until he reveals a bizarre disfigurement.  Apparently, this skit was the first one made and subsequently was used to entice other stars to join in the picture.  If they had continued at this level of quality then the movie may have been a 3-star affair, but it quickly devolves with the scatologically-obsessed ""The Proposition,"" which stars real-life couple Anna Farris and Chris Pratt.  They are two of the most likeable stars out there, and the skit does have a few funny lines, but like so many of the other sketches it quickly overstays its welcome and becomes simply disgusting.  The same thing applies to the appalling animated section, ""Beezel,"" about an obscenely disturbing cat.Despite the negative reviews, many people are likely to be curious about this movie and want to see one of their favorite stars.  I too got suckered into seeing this exceptionally bad movie.  Fortunately, it's short and the brevity of most of the skits make it go by quickly.",1,Horrendous movie,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,2104,"['43', 'looked', 'so', 'promising', 'massive', 'star-filled', 'cast', 'was', 'hoping', 'updated', 'Kentucky', 'Fried', 'Movie', 'ended', 'up', 'more', 'turkey', 'unfortunately', 'knew', 'movie', 'had', 'received', 'terrible', 'ratings', 'huge', 'fan', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'other', 'stars', 'including', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'still', 'had', 'see', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'divided', '10', 'skits', '3', 'commercials', 'wrap-around', 'skit', 'tie', 'everything', 'together', 'wrap-around', 'stars', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'movie', 'executive', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'who', 'extremely', 'leathery', 'here', 'producer', 'trying', 'pitch', 'picture', 'ideas', 'ideas', 'are', 'skits', 'most', 'make', 'sense', 'actual', 'movies', 'how', 'commercials', 'fit', 'concept', 'never', 'explained', 'few', 'skits', 'elicit', 'chuckles', 'however', 'most', 'completely', 'and/or', 'are', 'jaw-droppingly', 'raunchy', 'have', 'nothing', 'raunchiness', 'be', 'funny.The', 'movie', 'fine', 'first', 'skit', 'featuring', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'blind', 'date', 'Kate', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'dazzling', 'Hugh', 'still', 'single', 'bizarre', 'disfigurement', 'Apparently', 'skit', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'made', 'subsequently', 'was', 'used', 'entice', 'other', 'stars', 'join', 'picture', 'had', 'continued', 'level', 'quality', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', '3-star', 'affair', 'quickly', 'scatologically-obsessed', 'Proposition', 'real-life', 'couple', 'Anna', 'Farris', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'likeable', 'stars', 'there', 'skit', 'have', 'few', 'funny', 'lines', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'sketches', 'quickly', 'welcome', 'simply', 'disgusting', 'same', 'thing', 'applies', 'appalling', 'animated', 'section', 'Beezel', 'obscenely', 'disturbing', 'cat.Despite', 'negative', 'reviews', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'curious', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'favorite', 'stars', 'too', 'got', 'suckered', 'seeing', 'exceptionally', 'bad', 'movie', 'Fortunately', 'short', 'brevity', 'most', 'skits', 'make', 'go', 'quickly']",N/A
