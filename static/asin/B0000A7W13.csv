The best shows are NOT on this DVD; we need a DVD of all the seasons-- at least until DB left the show. The shows on this ""Best Of"" DVD are kind of dramatic. My favorite shows are the ones that are a little less political, such as the one where MaryJo had to decorate a nudist colony, the one where Bernice is courted by the Sugarbaker's crazy client (the guy with the bowtie who thinks his TV is getting struck by lightning)and then competes in a senior home beauty contest, and the one where MaryJo and Julia go to a keg party and must give Charlene lessons on class by telephone while she visits Bill's uptight family.",4,Want all the seasons!

Although diehard fans would pay higher prices, the loss of the casual fan will result in fewer sales which will not cover the ludicrous licensing increases.

The rest of that show however, particularly the end, is first the build up to it, and then an anticlimactic crash ending with some drippy country western song and a dialogue-less slow dance that is supposed to be 3 of the 4 couples making up after the big blow up. I was especially disappointed to see that the night ""The lights went out in Georgia,"" ""St. Louis Blues/Little Shrimp"" and ""Head stuck in a fence"" episodes were not chosen for this limited release.

At first, I was a little skeptical and did a quick search for Designing Women- and did not see anythng about it being released. Then I went to the TV home page- and looked through all upcoming releases- and saw ""Female Stars of the 80's"" with a picture of the Designing Women cast and the house they used in the credits- at the top of the picture, it says Complete First Season. You may pre-order if you'd like- and I believe that the seasons are 40 dollars. Anyway, to the point, spread the word- buy for yourself, friends, and families- we- the public, have been waiting for this for a long time- so absolutely buy this gem of a show!******************The Best of Designing Women- I can still remember the day I saw it in the local Wal-Mart. I blinked and quickly grabbed it and read over the back- and then hightailed it to the checkout counter.First off this show is funny. I am a Southern woman, and also felt that the women gave Southern women something to be proud of. I remember watching this show with my mom and laughing and loving it. I loved Suzanne- who my dad has said that I am the most like (which i take as a compliment) and could not wait to watch the show every day (in re-runs).This show still strikes me as one of the most funny shows= and it needs to be released in full seasons- not just a sampling.I'm not trying to be picky, but these are not the best of DW- although they are all good in their own ways- I wanted where Julia had her head stuck in the fence, Stranded- where anthony and suzzane become friends, the Atlantic City episode, and who could forget the ones where Julia's son made an appearance- the one where he was dating the older woman and then the one where he gets married- Now those 2 were great! Or Dash Golf the Writer, or the one where Jack, Suzannes Ex, writes a book and the ensuing antics that happen from there. But, obviously, there are too many to release just a best of- we need and deserve the full seasons.It just sickens me to see all the DVD's being released and people saying that we waited forever for something and it was only a few months- The Loyal DW fans have waited- and some of us have been very patient.",5,"UPDATE..

I very much want all seasons to be released, not just this ""best of"" DVD, which stars the original cast when they were at their peak.  Do not neglect the show after the original cast split, as there were some good, if not great moments that they still had, even though the show slowly but surely began to decline.Taking place around an interior decorating firm in Atlanta, we meet Julia, Charlene, Mary Jo and Suzanne with their eternally abused delivery man Anthony as they embark on one adventure after another.  While Bernice is still absent from these episodes, their chemistry is dynamic and observations always insightful without being too preachy.  They tackled a variety of topics, in the typical battle of the sexes way (a bunch of women working together, when they and their signifigant others are snowed in at a cabin, etc.) as well as those of social concern (the man who asks them to arrange his funeral as he is dying of AIDS).  The episode that will probably ring through the ages is the one where Suzanne returns to her high school reunion to overhear all the terrible remarks her classmates make when they see that she has gained weight.  Having once been overweight myself but having shed 45 pounds in the last year and a half, I can attest to the fact that people are so cruel.Bring on all seasons for DVD!",4,One of the greatest shows ever,1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,1422,"['loved', 'Designing', 'Women', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'rush', 'home', 'watch', 'reruns', 'weekday', 'very', 'much', 'want', 'seasons', 'be', 'released', 'not', 'just', 'best', 'DVD', 'original', 'cast', 'when', 'were', 'peak', 'Do', 'not', 'neglect', 'show', 'original', 'cast', 'split', 'were', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'moments', 'still', 'had', 'even', 'show', 'slowly', 'surely', 'began', 'decline.Taking', 'place', 'interior', 'decorating', 'firm', 'Atlanta', 'meet', 'Julia', 'Charlene', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'Suzanne', 'eternally', 'abused', 'delivery', 'man', 'Anthony', 'embark', 'one', 'adventure', 'Bernice', 'still', 'absent', 'episodes', 'chemistry', 'dynamic', 'observations', 'always', 'insightful', 'being', 'too', 'preachy', 'tackled', 'variety', 'topics', 'typical', 'battle', 'sexes', 'way', 'bunch', 'women', 'working', 'together', 'when', 'signifigant', 'others', 'are', 'snowed', 'cabin', 'etc', 'as', 'well', 'social', 'concern', 'man', 'who', 'arrange', 'funeral', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'episode', 'will', 'probably', 'ring', 'ages', 'one', 'where', 'Suzanne', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'overhear', 'terrible', 'remarks', 'classmates', 'make', 'when', 'see', 'gained', 'weight', 'Having', 'once', 'been', 'overweight', 'having', 'shed', '45', 'pounds', 'last', 'year', 'half', 'can', 'attest', 'fact', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'cruel.Bring', 'seasons', 'DVD']",N/A

This memorable series featured four intelligent, successful women who happened to be attractive and independent as well.The cast was lead by Dixie Carter who portrayed Julia Sugarbaker, the articulate, formidable owner of a thriving interior design business.  Her partner and sister, Suzanne Sugarbaker, delectably played by Delta Burke, was a saucy, endearingly self-centered former beauty queen with a knack for speaking exactly as she thought.  Annie Potts was the witty, wisecracking designer Mary Jo.  Rounding out the cast was Jean Smart who portrayed the kind-hearted and slightly naive office manager, Charlene.Unlike so many cardboard female characters on television at the time, the women of &quot;Designing Women&quot; were full-blooded and three dimensional.  They were risk-takers and role models.  How refreshing and commendable it was for Linda Bloodworth-Thomason to bring women like these to life in a weekly television series.  And what a superlative cast she assembled in Carter, Burke, Potts, and Smart.&quot;Designing Women&quot; paved the way for a more realistic representation of women on television.  It dealt with issues that are important to women in their day-to-day lives.
