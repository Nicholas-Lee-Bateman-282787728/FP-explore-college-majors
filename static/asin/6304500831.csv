Three stars says you like the movie, but at the same time your not in love with it. That explains my position perfectly. This is a charming movie that I thoroughly enjoyed as a child, and by all means it is superior to most films that are made for children today. My main issue is that I don't feel it is as strong as other classic movies from the Disney vault. It just doesn't compare to a Snow White, Peter Pan, Bambi, Lady And The Tramp, or Mary Poppins. It is good to note that this is a solid childrens film that the whole family can enjoy. However, I always hold Disney films under a more critical lense. Disney themselves set the standard for childrens films, so they should be judged by the standards they set forth. Jungle Book is a solid movie I am proud to own.

426239,A1AAN285FE45GP,6304500831,A. Fultz,"[162, 177]","This movie is more than just another Disney masterpiece.  The Jungle Book is a great tale of friendship and adventure.  Although almost every animated feature that was created during Walt Disney's life is a classic,  this one in particular holds a special place in the heart of many men (and  now thanks to video and DVD, boys) who saw it while growing up.  There  isn't a boy alive who can see this movie and not want to be Mowgli.  What a  life it would be to live in the jungle, with friends like Baloo and  Bagheera.  It is every young boys dream to be so free.That is not to say  that only boys will love this movie.  As with all Disney films, this one  will be enjoyed by all members of the family, young and old.  I saw it  growing up, and never forgot my memories of the movie, and the days  afterward, singing the songs and dreaming of adventure.The music in  The Jungle Book is some of the best in any Disney movie.  ""The Bare  Necessities"" is simply one of the best songs ever.  Add in the fantastic  animation and the characters that come to life (who wouldn't believe a bear  could sing after seeing this?), and you have one of the many classic Disney  stories.Starring the voices of Disney regulars Phil Harris and Sterling  Holloway, as well as Sebastian Cabot (Mr. French, to those of my  generation) and many others, this movie is too good to not buy.Get a  copy of this DVD before Disney removes it for another generation.

While Disney has put out many movies over the decades since Walt began his timeless journey, and many films became very popular in their day, The Jungle Book will stand as one of the all time greats along with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Mary Poppins, 101 Dalmatians, Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan and Cinderella to name a few.

All that does matter is knowing the differences in us all should not stand in the way of protecting another being, in this case Mowgli, a little boy.I cannot stand modern cartoons and I will not watch them.

426248,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304500831,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","One of those timeless tales, and one of Disney's finest hours, `The Jungle Book' is one of the best examples of the Disney canon that is NOT centered on a princess.  There is nothing wrong with princesses in my book (I've got two of them) but there is something special about a family film that reaches both genders in a way that isn't centered on love interests and royalty.  Teaching valuable lessons with a humble setting is what `The Jungle Book' is all about, and this dazzling 1967 film is top notch, for sure.The film tells that familiar tale of young Mowgli, a young boy raised by animals and segregated from civilization.  Threatened by the evil Shere Khan (a tiger), Mowgli's friends Baloo and Bagheera try and convince him to leave the jungle and join a nearby village.  Baloo, the boisterous and lovable bear, takes a stab at convincing the young boy to leave, but the fun they have makes the decision all the harder for the young boy, and Baloo.The film is one great moment after the other, and is filled to the brim with memorable songs and sequences, characters and sentimental life lessons that make the enjoyment factor VERY high with this one.  In fact, as an adult one can really take in this film and appreciate it on another level.  The themes of friendship and loyalty are strong here, and the bond that forms between Mowgli and Baloo is something special, and something that all ages will feel connected to.With splendid animation and songs that will remain with you year after year after year, `The Jungle Book' is a swinging good time to be had for the whole family.",5,"The bare necessities, and then some!",1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,1591,"['One', 'timeless', 'tales', 'one', 'Disney', 'finest', 'hours', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'Disney', 'canon', 'NOT', 'centered', 'princess', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'princesses', 'book', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two', 'something', 'special', 'family', 'film', 'genders', 'way', ""n't"", 'centered', 'love', 'interests', 'royalty', 'Teaching', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'humble', 'setting', 'what', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'dazzling', '1967', 'film', 'top', 'notch', 'sure.The', 'film', 'tells', 'familiar', 'tale', 'young', 'Mowgli', 'young', 'boy', 'raised', 'animals', 'segregated', 'civilization', 'Threatened', 'evil', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'tiger', 'Mowgli', 'friends', 'Baloo', 'Bagheera', 'try', 'convince', 'leave', 'jungle', 'join', 'nearby', 'village', 'Baloo', 'boisterous', 'lovable', 'bear', 'stab', 'convincing', 'young', 'boy', 'leave', 'fun', 'have', 'decision', 'harder', 'young', 'boy', 'Baloo.The', 'film', 'one', 'great', 'moment', 'other', 'filled', 'brim', 'memorable', 'songs', 'sequences', 'characters', 'sentimental', 'life', 'lessons', 'make', 'enjoyment', 'factor', 'VERY', 'high', 'one', 'fact', 'adult', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'take', 'film', 'appreciate', 'level', 'themes', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'are', 'strong', 'here', 'bond', 'Mowgli', 'Baloo', 'something', 'special', 'something', 'ages', 'will', 'feel', 'connected', 'to.With', 'splendid', 'animation', 'songs', 'will', 'remain', 'year', 'year', 'year', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'swinging', 'good', 'time', 'be', 'had', 'whole', 'family']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

It would seem they belong to colder climates. Oh, well, nobody asked for 100% authenticity. And how did the man cub learn to speak English? No more absurd than the rest of the animals in the jungle speaking English, I suppose.Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) is an adorable young man, maybe 11 years old and rail thin, when the wolf pack that raised him from a baby ""man cub"" decides he has to be taken to the man village because Shere Khan the Tiger (George Sanders) is around, and he hates humans. He would surely destroy the man cub and anyone who tried to protect him. So Bagheera the Panther (Sebastian Cabot) volunteers to take him to the man village.Mowgli doesn't want to go, he wants to stay in the jungle, even after Kaa the Snake (Sterling Holloway) hypnotizes him and the monkeys kidnap him. It turns out King Louie of the Apes (Louis Prima) wants Mowgli to teach him how to be a human. Specifically, he wants fire, but Mowgli doesn't know how to make fire, so that doesn't work out so well.There is also a brigade of elephants led by Col Hathi, who will tell anyone at the drop of a branch about how he won the Victoria Cross. The colonial's adorable little son makes friends with Mowgli, which turns out to be important later on.It's a fun story, but I won't swear it bears much resemblance to the original Jungle Book.

I stand over her and glare, using my powers of mind control to will her awake. It works!I was just desperate to see this movie.

I sobbed at the end, crying: No, Mowgli, don't leave your animal friends behind and live with people. You are making a big mistake!  Would he return to his original home?

426267,A3MQQS40FK2QAQ,6304500831,"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle""","[7, 21]","Disney's THE JUNGLE BOOK seems rather irrelevant today when you look at the film. The movie was made in 1967, a time when the Golden Age of Animation was clearly over, especially for Disney. Watching this movie on laserdisc a couple of days ago I noticed how grainy the animation looked. And one shot looked like it was an exact copy of another shot. I understand why  Disney used to do every single thing by hand--painstakingly doing it frame by frame. Every thing was carefully detailed. But by the 1960's it was too expensive to do. They started cutting corners. The animation grew worse in the 1970's, and it wasn't until new technology came out in the 80's that animation regained its glory.But back to THE JUNGLE BOOK. Although the animation now seems rather cheap, it's still an enjoyable film. The story involves a boy named Mowgli. A Panther named Bagheera found him as a baby and took him to a wolf family, who quickly adopted him. It was too far to take him to his own kind, and he hunched that he would have to go back to his own kind.Mowgli grows up sheltered and happy. But Shere Khan, a menacing tiger is in the area. Mowgli is in danger because this tiger hates man. The wolves agree the boy must be taken somewhere safe. Bagheera volunteers to take him to a man-village.But Mowgli has no desire to go. He insists on staying in the jungle. Bagheera tries to reason with him, explaining the danger of Shere Khan and why he hates man. Reasoning doesn't work, and it's only after meeting several characters along the way, including Shere Khan, that Mowgli learns why he must go into the man-village.Every single character he meets with the exception of Shere Khan results in a song. It is here that the film shines in its best area. Mowgli meets a heard of Military Elephants, a bouncing, bear named Baloo, a slithering snake with a hypnotising ability, and a bee-bopping arangutain. Each character has a personality that I enjoyed. The head of the Elephants is a pompous, overblown, arrogant soldier. Baloo is an instantly likeable bear who bonds with Mowgli and believes that he can protect him like a son. The two have a great musical number with ""The Bear-Necessities"". The best and most entertaining part is when he meets the king of the monkeys--King Louie, who sings a really catchy song: ""I wanna be like you"".King Louie was voiced by Louis Prima, known as the ""king of scat"". I saw footage of him and his band, where they walk into the audience playing their instruments. Watching the animation of King Louie, it occurred to me that the animators studied footage of Prima and were inspired by it.There was one part of the film that I felt just kind of dragged it. It's a musical number involving the hypnotising snake named Kaa. He is voiced by Sterling Halloway, who had voiced a number of animated Disney characters. Although I enjoyed hearing his voice, the number just started to drag as he put Mowgli to sleep. (In fact, a scene occurs that is an exact duplicate of an earlier one. Watch this character and you'll see what I mean.)The tiger Shere Khan is actually an interesting villain. This comes not because of how he is written, but because of his voice. He sounds like a calm, polite, and reasonable gentleman. Although he will clearly kill Mowgli, he actually has some respect for him. Every time he opened his voice I actually wanted him to continue talking.So-overall, I do recommend the movie. It will entertain kids as well as parents. But it's a mix-up between good and bad. The good stuff are the supporting characters who surround Mowgli (especially Baloo, Shere Khan, and King Louie) and the really catchy musical numbers. The bad parts are the rather primitive animation and a musical number that drags the film. Disney has done far superior animated movies both before, and after ""THE JUNGLE BOOK"". However, Disney films are not my favorite animated movies anymore. Sure, they're still entertaining, and some have wonderful touching themes. But the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki is the best in the field.

Mom""","[2, 3]","If there is some kind of contest on for the Walt Disney movie which least resembles the supposed source material, ""The Jungle Book"" must be the clear winner. It bears only the lightest and most coincidental resemblance to Rudyard Kiplings's cycle of stories about a little boy raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. Only the setting and the names of characters are preserved. That said, ""The Jungle Book"" deserves to be considered on its' own terms as a classically animated Disney feature,  the very last to have been blessed by the hand of Walt himself. The plot is as thin as a wisp; the journey of the boy Mowgli to the village of his own kind, interspersed with some good-natured musical numbers, and helped or hindered by a variety of genial animals, and not terribly threatening villains.It is a curious jumble, to watch with eyes accustomed to more recent animated features like ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story"". Without exception the backgrounds are beautifully rendered, densely detailed, almost painterly. The animal characters were fully-fleshed, and with the exception of Kaaa, the python, seemed to move and flex like their real counterparts; especially King Louie the baboon, Bagheera the panther and Sher Khan the tiger. The last two seemed especially slinky; it would be nice to know if the artists responsible for their rendering had cats. King Louie is hilarious, and so are the four vultures - very obviously patterned after the Beatles.  In contrast, the rendering of Mowgli the boy and ostensible hero, looks like a bland and sketchily rendered cut-out. It almost seems as if the artists were far more interested in the animals.The extra features included are generous; this is veritably the platinum standard for a DVD classic. It is on  two discs; necessary to contain the complete movie and commentary. There is also a nearly hour-long feature about how the movie was developed, along with several shorter features. One of the bonus features is a look at a character ""Rocky the Rhino"" who was eventually omitted - rather a pity actually, since Rocky  would have been voiced by the man who did ""Crazy Guggenheim"". There are also complete recordings of songs which were dropped from the final version, and probably a good call. There are also generous picture galleries of the characters and of the background art, which was purely my favorite, and a series of games. The actual movie itself takes barely more than an hour itself, but the extras will keep an audience amused for days.",4,Only a Light and Coincidental Resemblance,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,2498,"['kind', 'contest', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'movie', 'least', 'supposed', 'source', 'material', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'must', 'be', 'clear', 'winner', 'only', 'lightest', 'most', 'coincidental', 'resemblance', 'Rudyard', 'Kiplings', 'cycle', 'stories', 'little', 'boy', 'raised', 'wolves', 'Indian', 'jungle', 'Only', 'setting', 'names', 'characters', 'are', 'preserved', 'said', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'be', 'considered', 'own', 'terms', 'classically', 'animated', 'Disney', 'feature', 'very', 'last', 'have', 'been', 'blessed', 'hand', 'Walt', 'plot', 'as', 'thin', 'wisp', 'journey', 'boy', 'Mowgli', 'village', 'own', 'kind', 'interspersed', 'good-natured', 'musical', 'numbers', 'helped', 'hindered', 'variety', 'genial', 'animals', 'not', 'terribly', 'threatening', 'villains.It', 'curious', 'jumble', 'watch', 'eyes', 'accustomed', 'more', 'recent', 'animated', 'features', 'Shrek', 'Toy', 'Story', 'exception', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'densely', 'detailed', 'almost', 'painterly', 'animal', 'characters', 'were', 'fully-fleshed', 'exception', 'Kaaa', 'python', 'seemed', 'move', 'flex', 'real', 'counterparts', 'especially', 'King', 'Louie', 'baboon', 'Bagheera', 'panther', 'Sher', 'Khan', 'tiger', 'last', 'two', 'seemed', 'especially', 'slinky', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'know', 'artists', 'responsible', 'rendering', 'had', 'cats', 'King', 'Louie', 'hilarious', 'so', 'are', 'four', 'vultures', 'very', 'obviously', 'patterned', 'Beatles', 'contrast', 'rendering', 'Mowgli', 'boy', 'ostensible', 'hero', 'bland', 'sketchily', 'rendered', 'cut-out', 'almost', 'artists', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'animals.The', 'extra', 'features', 'included', 'are', 'generous', 'veritably', 'platinum', 'standard', 'DVD', 'classic', 'two', 'discs', 'necessary', 'contain', 'complete', 'movie', 'commentary', 'also', 'nearly', 'hour-long', 'feature', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'developed', 'several', 'shorter', 'features', 'One', 'bonus', 'look', 'character', 'Rocky', 'Rhino', 'who', 'was', 'eventually', 'omitted', 'rather', 'pity', 'actually', 'Rocky', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'voiced', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'Crazy', 'Guggenheim', 'are', 'also', 'complete', 'recordings', 'songs', 'were', 'dropped', 'final', 'version', 'probably', 'good', 'call', 'are', 'also', 'generous', 'picture', 'galleries', 'characters', 'background', 'art', 'was', 'purely', 'favorite', 'series', 'games', 'actual', 'movie', 'barely', 'more', 'hour', 'extras', 'will', 'keep', 'audience', 'amused', 'days']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

But when you look at it, The Jungle Book was probably one of Disney's more optimistic and overly-joyful outings; from its music to its humor to its voice acting. But it also had, like a lot of Disney films had, a sense of something beyond surface-level that you could get out of it. While certain things about it feel unpolished, it's a good capper on Walt Disney's influential career and a good film on its own.One day in the jungle, Bagheera the panther finds a small baby in the woods. Not having the heart to abandon it, he decides to leave it with a small wolf pack. Now 10, Mowgli wants to stay in the jungle and be like everyone else but when the feared Shere Khan the tiger is spotted with a loathesome opinion of man, Bagheera has to help Mowgli get to a man-village. But when free-spirited bear Baloo comes in befriending Mowgli and seductive snake Kaa wanting Mowgli for lunch, it becomes harder to get him safely to the village.Probably best known as Disney's last film before he died in 1966, the Jungle Book is one of those kind of films where others have done better in certain areas yet the film pulls it off anyway. For one thing, the animation is not as impressive as Sleeping Beauty was, the villain doesn't have the presence and staying power like Captain Hook or Cruella Da Vil. And after many a viewings, I still never found the elephant herd likable or even entertaining on some way.

We also get a making-of and a commentary but then again it's got that Disney tendency of putting in kid's games so it might not be stockful of meaningful info but at least you can say it's stocked.Parts of me enjoy the Jungle Book but another half of me finds it the least likely candidate of the Platinum releases to get constant replaying but it's a fun movie anyway that kids will no doubt love.By the way, for those interested, next is 101 Dalmations for Spring and apparently, Sleeping Beauty is being re-released this time next year for Blu-Ray.",4,4.5; one of Disney's more zanier outings,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,2567,"['hate', 'word', 'zany', 'sense', 'craziness', 'heart', 'anything', 'substance', 'when', 'look', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'Disney', 'more', 'optimistic', 'overly-joyful', 'outings', 'music', 'humor', 'voice', 'acting', 'also', 'had', 'lot', 'Disney', 'films', 'had', 'sense', 'something', 'surface-level', 'could', 'get', 'certain', 'things', 'feel', 'unpolished', 'good', 'capper', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'influential', 'career', 'good', 'film', 'own.One', 'day', 'jungle', 'Bagheera', 'panther', 'small', 'baby', 'woods', 'Not', 'having', 'heart', 'abandon', 'leave', 'small', 'wolf', 'pack', 'Now', '10', 'Mowgli', 'stay', 'jungle', 'be', 'everyone', 'else', 'when', 'feared', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'tiger', 'spotted', 'loathesome', 'opinion', 'man', 'Bagheera', 'help', 'Mowgli', 'get', 'man-village', 'when', 'free-spirited', 'bear', 'Baloo', 'befriending', 'Mowgli', 'seductive', 'snake', 'Kaa', 'wanting', 'Mowgli', 'lunch', 'harder', 'get', 'safely', 'village.Probably', 'best', 'known', 'Disney', 'last', 'film', 'died', '1966', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'one', 'kind', 'films', 'where', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'certain', 'areas', 'yet', 'film', 'off', 'anyway', 'one', 'thing', 'animation', 'not', 'as', 'impressive', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'was', 'villain', ""n't"", 'have', 'presence', 'staying', 'power', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Cruella', 'Da', 'Vil', 'many', 'viewings', 'still', 'never', 'found', 'elephant', 'herd', 'likable', 'even', 'entertaining', 'way', 'rest', 'film', 'what', 'have', 'fun', 'music', 'ever-popular', 'Bare', 'Necessities', 'infectious', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', '.Make', 'jokes', 'want', 'DI', 'NEY', 'tendency', 'favor', 'money', 'product', 'art', ""'re"", 'second', 'none', 'when', 'down', 'getting', 'film', 'look', 'pristine', 'animation', 'style', 'bit', 'cruder', 'started', '101', 'Dalmations', 'continued', 'till', '80', 'probably', 'best', 'looking', 'version', 'film', 'there', 'also', 'get', 'making-of', 'commentary', 'then', 'again', 'got', 'Disney', 'tendency', 'putting', 'kid', 'games', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'stockful', 'meaningful', 'info', 'least', 'can', 'say', 'stocked.Parts', 'enjoy', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'half', 'least', 'likely', 'candidate', 'Platinum', 'get', 'constant', 'replaying', 'fun', 'movie', 'anyway', 'kids', 'will', 'doubt', 'love.By', 'way', 'interested', 'next', '101', 'Dalmations', 'Spring', 'apparently', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'being', 're-released', 'time', 'next', 'year', 'Blu-Ray']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

That goofy Bagera (aka, Baggy) is just very funny as he tries to get Mowgli to return to his own kind.  Particularly before Shere Khan finds him.  And, let's not forget Shere Khan's wonderful voice - I forge the guy's name but what a singing voice too!  Wow!  I love that bit he does with the vultures close to the end of the movie.  Wow!  But old Baggy and Baloo eventually get Mowgli back to his own kind and go off dancing in the jungle together, arm-in-arm.  Can you imagine Victor French ever doing that?  He just seems so proper!  And, let's not forget the snake.  I love how he coils around everyone and then gets his tail tied in a knot!  Pretty funny stuff.

The story of Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera is well-known by now; watching it after all these years has increased my appreciation of it. I highly recommend watching the Making-of documentaries first, as they will also enhance your viewing experience. Especially enlightening is the story of how Walt changed the Rudyard Kipling tale and why (and to learn that he actually returned to the original text for his inspiration of how to end his version). It is also somewhat sad to see that this was the last film to have Disney's indelible stamp on it due to his death, yet also inspiring to hear the animators talk about what they put into the film as well as future animators who were inspired as youngsters by viewing it. Different concepts along the way are interesting to see, and not surprising to learn that Phil Harris put much of his own personality into the dialogue and characterization of Baloo.

Superbly voiced by Phil Harris, Baloo seems to be endowed with all the characteristics that made Walt Disney himself so beloved: he's charming, funny, warm, inventive, child-like and a helluva lot of fun to be around.  How poignant that he was pretty much the master animator's final creation.  The ""ridiculous"" being four mop-topped Liverpudlian vultures.  This embarrasingly misguided homage to the Beatles -- who sing a hackneyed barbershop quartet yet -- lowers ""The Jungle Book"" to a level it never rises above.  Too bad, as the film up until then has been a near-classic.  The animation is gorgeously detailed and colorful, the scoring by George Bruns mysterious and evocative and the songs clever and memorable.  I say ""near""-classic, as I find the elephants both boring and unneccesary, particularly when they set out to find the missing Mowgli and trudge themselves right out of the film, never to be seen again!

The reason that I gave this 4 stars is simply because they cropped the movie from top and bottom to make it widescreen.  It's not true that you won't see the characters heads.  Yes, you lose a little from the picture, but then so you do if you play the full frame version on a widescreen TV and you set the TV to ""widezoom"" instead of 16:9, because if you set the TV to 16:9 you will see everything ""flat"".  So you need to set it to a more normal aspect ratio, which in the Sony case it's called ""widezoom"", Philips has the ""Zoom 16:9"" and ""Zoom 14:9"", others have other names for that setting.  When you watch the movie like that, in order to fill the entire screen, you will lose from top and bottom on a full frame movie.However, with this movie, they didn't simply just cut the movie from top and bottom.  They did an entire re-working of the film, where they take it frame by frame and they cut from top and bottom where there's unimportant stuff on the screen.  In other words, if you have a scene where the character is shown more on the top of the screen, and you have a rock or grass, or something else on the bottom, then they will cut only from the bottom enough so that it fits on a widescreen frame.  In other scenes, they will cut accordingly, so that you won't lose essential stuff that must be seen.Therefore, if you're trying to make a decision whether or not you should replace your original, full-frame DVD of this movie with this new widescreen version, I guess it all comes down to how much of a movie buff you are.  If you really really love a classic, an original, then you will stick to the original full frame if you already have it.  If you just want to own a copy of this movie, and you own a widescreen TV and you adore new technology, then I suggest that you buy this new version.  They made it to fit just that profile.Me - I already own the original full-frame DVD.

The new Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.Fortunately, The Jungle Book is one of Disney's best from this time period and because of the luke warm reception of Sword in the Stone Walt had a lot more to do with this film than that one. The Jungle Book has extremely memorable characters and has some of the best songs to grace any Disney film. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone. I can only imagine what this film would have looked like if it were done without the Xerography process. The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed just comes across like their unpolished. This process worked well with this film, Winnie the Pooh and 101 Dalmatians though, but after ending the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and now the Blu Ray release and they all have their good points and bad points. the first release has no bonus features, but is in the superior full screen format. While the restoration isn't as impressive as the newer release, it looks very good and actually helps to soften the rough lines in the animation. The newer release has been restored and looks great, but the widescreen presentation is cramped chopping off heads and feet in some scenes. Also the rough lines are more exaggerated. The EASY solution (Disney I'm talking to YOU!) would have been to include BOTH formats.*****BLU RAY UPDATE******The new Blu Ray release looks fabulous, but it does not include the full screen version of the film.This is disappointing news for purist.******END OF UPDATE*****If I had to choose one edition I would keep my Limited issue DVD as the Full Screen Film is really what's important here. I would like to see it sparkle like the new edition, but I prefer the presentation in full screen rather than widescreen. It was shown both ways in theaters so why not offer both? The film is short enough and the extras don't take up that much space. I'll keep Blu Ray and the Limited editions as the film really does look great in HD dispite this flaw.",4,A DISNEY CLASSIC!

But I felt like I had to make an exception when it came to Disney. All of their &quot;Limited Issues&quot; seem to have little or no extras at all, but the actual animated classic that the disc holds, for me anyway, more then makes up for it.&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; is one of the first Disney Movies that I watched as a kid. I bought the DVD, and I saw the movie today for the first time in around 12 years. The entertainment value is suprisingly still there, and more over, as a grown up movie fan, I can appreciate the film more as a classic in animated films from Disney &amp; not just a 'cartoon' to pass the time, like I considered it to be as an adolecent.The picture and sound is satisfying for the film's age and genre; the Spanish Dubbing is an excellent addition, for some of my family anyway. But it pales in comparison to the English vocals; The animation is terrific, too bad it wasn't created in a widescreen aspect ratio, it would have been a great visual to have looked at (The film is presented in it's original theatrical aspect ratio, 1.33:1).Now that the announcment of Disney's 10 &quot;Platinum Editions&quot; have been made (The first of the 10 being &quot;Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs&quot;, but &quot;Jungle Book&quot; will be one of the other 9), this &quot;Jungle Book - Limited Issue&quot; is a fine way to have the film until the full-fleged &quot;Jungle Book - Platinum Edition&quot; is released sometime in the next decade.

Now that Mogli is older, Shiar Khan the tiger, wants Mogli dead. Now the wolves and Bagira the panther have to bring him back to the human village to be with his own kind and for his own safety. Mogli wants no part of that and while running away from Begari's sight, he runs into Baloo, a fun loving Bear who teaches Mogli how to have a good time and the &quot;Bear Necessities&quot;.I really love this movie.

426308,ARNEUO7BF3J55,6304500831,E. David Swan,"[2, 3]","Jungle Book, the movie, is radically different from the classic Rudyard Kipling novel but I tend to be more forgiving if a movie preserves the spirit of the book but in this case it absolutely doesn't. The characters are completely different and remain the same only in name and species. In particular the literary Baloo is nothing like the singing slacker from the movie. One might note that at the beginning it states that the movie was `inspired' by Kipling's Jungle Book and I assume by this it means that Disney was inspired to write a completely new story. The real question is whether or not the Jungle Book, standing on its own, is a quality animated movie. Of course it is, it's Disney but that doesn't mean it's spectacular. The Jungle Book is a rather small tale that takes place over the course of one or two days as Mowgli is taken by Bagheera and Baloo to live in the man village.There are a few issues with the movie that can be a bit cringe worthy. The monkeys who kidnap Mowgli, including King Louis, are all portrayed as stereotypical blacks. Now one might argue that the movie does take place in Africa except it doesn't. The Jungle Book takes place in India which is in Asia. Why aren't the monkeys portrayed as stereotypical Indians? There is a tremendous amount of Disneyfication. In the book Mowgli grows to loath the humans for their treatment of his parents and uses elephants to raze the village to the ground. This is, shall we say, NOT the ending Disney went with. In the book Mowgli kills Shere Khan and skins him rather than having him scamper off with his tail on fire.The animation is old fashioned yeoman type work but in this case that is a big compliment. There is no corner cutting here as each characters is drawn alive and active rather than static with moving mouths as cheaper animation studios will do. The character movement is very believable and I'm sure a ton of rotoscoping was done which I don't consider cheating in the least. Disney was well known for doing meticulous research on animal movement and Shere Kahn looks great as he stalks Mowgli. The music is very catchy including the python Kaa's `Trust in Me' and Baloo's wonderful `Bear Necessities'. Overall the animation is probably average or below average for a Disney movie (which are always above average for animation in general). It's very dark and often bland.So what you get is a dramatically watered down story that kinds of leaves it a bit dull. It's just a one (or perhaps two) day journey to the man village and not a whole heckuva lot happens. There are segments where Mowgli meets a group of elephants and another with some buzzards imitating the Beatles (a rather unfortunate attempt to tap into some pop culture circa 1967). Both of these segments added nothing to the larger story which is paper thin. I like the concept behind The Jungle Book and there are great elements but if I were to start a collection of Disney movies The Jungle Book would be low on my list of movies to own.",4,Mediocre By Disney Standards,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,3003,"['Jungle', 'Book', 'movie', 'radically', 'different', 'classic', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'novel', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'forgiving', 'movie', 'spirit', 'book', 'case', 'absolutely', ""n't"", 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'remain', 'same', 'only', 'name', 'species', 'particular', 'literary', 'Baloo', 'nothing', 'singing', 'slacker', 'movie', 'One', 'might', 'note', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'inspired', 'Kipling', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'assume', 'Disney', 'was', 'inspired', 'write', 'completely', 'new', 'story', 'real', 'question', 'not', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'standing', 'own', 'quality', 'animated', 'movie', 'course', 'Disney', ""n't"", 'mean', 'spectacular', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'rather', 'small', 'tale', 'place', 'course', 'one', 'two', 'days', 'Mowgli', 'taken', 'Bagheera', 'Baloo', 'live', 'man', 'are', 'few', 'issues', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'monkeys', 'who', 'kidnap', 'Mowgli', 'including', 'King', 'Louis', 'are', 'portrayed', 'stereotypical', 'blacks', 'Now', 'one', 'might', 'argue', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'Africa', ""n't"", 'Jungle', 'Book', 'place', 'India', 'Asia', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'monkeys', 'portrayed', 'stereotypical', 'Indians', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'Disneyfication', 'book', 'Mowgli', 'loath', 'humans', 'treatment', 'parents', 'elephants', 'raze', 'village', 'ground', 'shall', 'say', 'NOT', 'ending', 'Disney', 'went', 'book', 'Mowgli', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'rather', 'having', 'scamper', 'off', 'tail', 'fire.The', 'animation', 'old', 'fashioned', 'yeoman', 'type', 'work', 'case', 'big', 'compliment', 'corner', 'cutting', 'here', 'characters', 'drawn', 'alive', 'active', 'rather', 'static', 'moving', 'mouths', 'cheaper', 'animation', 'studios', 'will', 'do', 'character', 'movement', 'very', 'believable', ""'m"", 'sure', 'ton', 'rotoscoping', 'was', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'cheating', 'least', 'Disney', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'doing', 'meticulous', 'research', 'animal', 'movement', 'Shere', 'Kahn', 'great', 'Mowgli', 'music', 'very', 'catchy', 'including', 'python', 'Kaa', 'Trust', 'Me', 'Baloo', 'wonderful', 'Bear', 'Necessities', 'animation', 'probably', 'average', 'below', 'average', 'Disney', 'movie', 'are', 'always', 'average', 'animation', 'general', 'very', 'dark', 'often', 'bland.So', 'what', 'get', 'dramatically', 'watered', 'down', 'story', 'kinds', 'leaves', 'bit', 'dull', 'just', 'one', 'perhaps', 'two', 'day', 'journey', 'man', 'village', 'not', 'whole', 'heckuva', 'lot', 'are', 'segments', 'where', 'Mowgli', 'group', 'elephants', 'buzzards', 'imitating', 'Beatles', 'rather', 'unfortunate', 'attempt', 'tap', 'pop', 'culture', 'circa', '1967', 'segments', 'added', 'nothing', 'larger', 'story', 'paper', 'thin', 'concept', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'are', 'great', 'elements', 'were', 'start', 'collection', 'Disney', 'movies', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'would', 'be', 'low', 'list', 'movies', 'own']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

As he grows older, he journeys into the wild to discover who he is. He's accompanied on his trip by a bear named Baloo, who helps keep him safe as he meets all sorts of friendly and malicious creatures along the way.""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 1.75:1. The picture is clear and the colors of the jungle and its creatures are vibrant and warm. There will be some complaints that the film is too clean and has lost its original cinematic flavor because of its digital upgrade. I found it to be a pleasant watch visually, however.A 7.1 DTS-HD mix was given for ""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition. It enhances all the song numbers and atmospheric noises one would expect to hear in the jungle. The surround sound mix is something Walt Disney himself probably never imagined possible. It really beefs up the home viewing experience.""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition includes over two hours of bonus material. There's behind-the-scenes featurettes like ""Sparking Creativity,"" ""Music, Memories, Mowgli,"" and I Wan'na Be Like You."" ""Bear-E-Oke"" Sing-Along will get the children in your household whooping and hollering in joy. Special Introductions to the movie are provided by Diane Disney Miller and Richard M. Sherman.

He takes the young mancub to a family of wolves who raise the boy as one of their own.  10 years go by, and news begins to spread that the tiger Shere Khan, who distrusts Man, has returned.  Fearing for Mowgli's safety, Bagheera agrees to take Mowgli to the nearest Man village, where he will be protected.Mowgli, however, doesn't want to leave the jungle, the only home he has ever known.  He runs away from Bagheera and meets Baloo, a happy-go-lucky bear, and decides to be like him in order to stay in the jungle.  It's up to Bagheera to convince the two of them that Mowgli will be safer in the Man village.  Together, the three set out against the many hilarious and menacing obstacles that await them on their journey.A Disney classic, one of the best things about this movie is the voice work: Sebastion Cabot as the up-tight panther Bagheera; Phil Harris as the &quot;jungle bum&quot; bear Baloo; George Sanderson as Shere Khan, giving him almost an upper crust dignity; and in two of the best roles in the film, jazz star Louis Prima as the orangutang King Louie who wants the secret of man's fire from Mowgli so that he, too, can be a man; and Sterling Holloway as the sly snake Kaa who only wants the mancub for a tasy meal.

THE JUNGLE BOOK is the current title on this marketing merry-go-round, and the question inevitably arises: should you replace your earlier DVD with this the new ""Platinum Edition?""  The answer is a firm ""maybe.""Certainly there's no question about the film itself.  Released in 1967, THE JUNGLE BOOK really is one Disney's finest, a very free adaptation of the Kipling tale of a child who is raised by wolves and must break with the jungle in order to enter human society.  Beautifully animated in the classic hand-rendered style and brilliantly voiced by the likes of Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, and George Sanders, this is a film certain to charm children and adults alike--and it is among the handful of Disney films that I have gone out of my way to keep in my library.But do I really need all the bells and whistles of the current edition?  The re-master is nice, but I have to note that THE JUNGLE BOOK was never actually in need of a major restoration in the same way that SNOW WHITE, FANTASIA, or PETER PAN were.  It looks great, yes, but you may not notice much difference in picture and sound between the earlier DVD release and the current one.  As for the special features--I enjoyed the audio commentary and the ""making of"" feature; I was also amused by the ""lost scene.""  But I could not care less about the rest of the content, which ranges from the kiddie-silly to the uninspired.Ultimately, your decision to purchase the Platinum Edition of THE JUNGLE BOOK rests on how much of a Disney fan you actually are.  If you can't bear to let a single item go buy, or if you are particular fan of this title, by all means purchase it--you'll find it worth the money.  And if you don't own it at all, or if you're still making do with an old VHS copy, obviously this is the way to go.  But if you do own the earlier DVD edition and you are happy with it, don't feel you have to make this ""Platinum Edition"" a priority.Five stars for the film in and of itself!GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,The Platinum Edition: To Buy Or Not To Buy?,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,2107,"['Disney', 'Studios', 'become', 'infamous', 'repeatedly', 'revamping', 're-releasing', 'most', 'celebrated', 'titles', 'JUNGLE', 'BOOK', 'current', 'title', 'marketing', 'merry-go-round', 'question', 'inevitably', 'should', 'replace', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'new', 'Platinum', 'Edition', 'answer', 'firm', 'maybe', 'Certainly', 'question', 'film', 'Released', '1967', 'JUNGLE', 'BOOK', 'really', 'one', 'Disney', 'finest', 'very', 'free', 'adaptation', 'Kipling', 'tale', 'child', 'who', 'raised', 'wolves', 'must', 'break', 'jungle', 'order', 'enter', 'human', 'society', 'Beautifully', 'animated', 'classic', 'hand-rendered', 'style', 'brilliantly', 'voiced', 'likes', 'Phil', 'Harris', 'Sebastian', 'Cabot', 'Louis', 'Prima', 'George', 'Sanders', 'film', 'certain', 'charm', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'handful', 'Disney', 'films', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'keep', 'library.But', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'bells', 'whistles', 'current', 'edition', 're-master', 'nice', 'have', 'note', 'THE', 'JUNGLE', 'BOOK', 'was', 'never', 'actually', 'need', 'major', 'restoration', 'same', 'way', 'SNOW', 'WHITE', 'FANTASIA', 'PETER', 'PAN', 'were', 'great', 'yes', 'may', 'not', 'notice', 'much', 'difference', 'picture', 'sound', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'release', 'current', 'one', 'special', 'features', 'enjoyed', 'audio', 'commentary', 'making', 'feature', 'was', 'also', 'amused', 'lost', 'scene', 'could', 'not', 'care', 'less', 'rest', 'content', 'kiddie-silly', 'uninspired.Ultimately', 'decision', 'purchase', 'Platinum', 'Edition', 'THE', 'JUNGLE', 'BOOK', 'how', 'much', 'Disney', 'fan', 'actually', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'let', 'single', 'item', 'go', 'buy', 'are', 'particular', 'fan', 'title', 'means', 'purchase', ""'ll"", 'find', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', ""'re"", 'still', 'making', 'do', 'old', 'VHS', 'copy', 'obviously', 'way', 'go', 'do', 'own', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'edition', 'are', 'happy', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'have', 'make', 'Platinum', 'Edition', 'priority.Five', 'stars', 'film', 'GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

426330,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,6304500831,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[8, 12]","Mary Poppins is considered by many to be Walt Disney's crowning achievement, combining almost everything he had developed in one movie, and rightly so. But after watching this new double-disc DVD release of THE JUNGLE BOOK, I think a case could be made that it also is the culmination of almost everything Walt and his studio developed in the field of animation.Now, The Jungle Book is not the most innovative, lavish, dazzling or detailed animated feature in the Disney library. It even has those ""scritchy lines"" that my brother and I used to dislike when the studio switched to Xeroxing cels in the 1960's. But like Poppins, no other animation studio could have produced a feature with the kind of character animation; storytelling and musical interweaving that Disney could in this film.There's a reason that the master animators and directors of today who you'll see interviewed on the second disc were influenced by The Jungle Book in their youth and used the animation as reference for their work. When I saw and heard the songs and story ideas that did not make their way into the film (and they are plentiful on this release) because Walt changed them, it will make you wonder how post-Walt movies might have been different had he lived to supervise them.I love good audio commentaries, and disc one has a nice one with composer Richard Sherman, animator Andreas Deja and voice of Mowgli Bruce Reitherman. Thanks to Mr. Sherman, I finally found out that George Sanders does not sing the last line of ""That's What Friends Are For."" It's Bill Lee, whom Tim and I discuss at length in Mouse Tracks. (And speaking of records, the gallery contains a shot of a store display filled with Disneyland Jungle Book LP's.)Musically, you can hear seven songs Terry Gilkyson wrote for the earlier, ""darker"" version of The Jungle Book. It's fascinating stuff. One of the songs sound like it should have been in a Rankin/Bass special. And the original demo of ""The Bare Necessities"" is very different from the version we all know.We finally get to see what the ""Rocky Rhino"" sequence might have been like before Walt deleted it. It's also amazing to hear what ""That's What Friends Are For"" might have sounded like had The Beatles or the had either done the voices for the vultures or, after they declined, had Walt not changed his mind about having the vultures sing like them anyway. My feeling is that Walt was right about it being dated. An unintended example: Entertaining as The Jonas Brothers video is that also appears on this disc (from DisneyMania 5), if this young group actually sang ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" in the movie it would have the same era-specific pop music effect.Disney fans will want to glory in the fresh batch of special features on disc two.

One would expect this to have a detrimental effect but it all works in the movie's favor. It's basically a string of sketches and set pieces cobbled around a loose narrative, though it flies by quickly, especially when Baloo is on the screen.Mowgli is a man-cub abandoned in the jungles of India and raised by wolves when Bagheera, a concerned panther, steps in and rescues him. Around 10 years later Bagheera tries to take him back to the man village but they are sidetracked by a variety of animals including Kaa, the snake, and lovable, floppy-armed King Louie, an orangutan who wants the secret of fire.Much of the movie has a late-60s jazz theme which keeps it moving and jiving. The jungle animation, making great use of multi-plane cameras, is absolutely gorgeous, and makes every scene a joy to look at, even during some of the lulls (anything with the Elephants).It's easy to see why it has become a classic as the characters are brilliant. Baloo and Co. came back in TaleSpin 23 years later and secured their status among the most popular Disney characters.The Blu-ray looks absolutely gor-gee-ous in 1.75:1 1080p.

From the very beginning, when we see Bagheera rescuing the abandoned ""man-cub,"" Mowgli and entrusting him to the wolf pack, to Mowgli's journey through the jungle to the man village, it's a pure delight. Shere Khan, who hates man, has returned to the jungle to find young  Mowgli and kill him. The wolf pack hears about this and decides it's too dangerous to keep him around any longer, and have Bagheera escort him to the man village to safety. Of course, Mowgli does not want to leave the jungle, and tries to get away from Bagheera. He meets Baloo the bear, Kaa the python, and the scat-singing King Louie (voiced by the legendary Louie Prima).

For me I look to the things they've done the best and ""Jungle Book"" is one of the very best.The characters are all well defined visually and the voices match the look perfectly. The songs are not just memorable they are almost necessary for a well rounded childhood.No matter your age there will be someone here that you identify with. (I'd like it if I were Shere Khan, but I'm probably a little more King Louie) This is a fast paced, jazzy and fairly hip (for it's time) feature. It was one of the few that I never minded the kids saying, ""More! Again!""The extras are fine, but I rarely judge a DVD release by the extras. In this case I was very happy with restored brilliance of color and sound.

426373,A3OH101U0CPUC7,6304500831,Joseph Boone,"[2, 2]","The Jungle Book tells the story of a boy named Mowgli who is raised by wolves in an Indian jungle.  He leads an idyllic life befriended by many animals until the day that Shere Khan, the tiger, returns to the area intent on killing the boy.  The animals decide to send Mowgli to the man-village where his people can protect him.  Bagheera the panther gets the job of escorting him, but Mowgli has no desire to leave the jungle.  In his desperation. Mowgli links up with Baloo the Bear and attempts learn the ""Bear Necessities.""  A good deal more happens, but I don't want to give away the whole plot.Disney has made few movies that have maintained their popularity as well as The Jungle Book.  It is a true classic.  First, the voice talent is quite possibly the finest ever assembled for an animated film.  Younger audiences will not be familiar with names like George Sanders and Sebastian Cabot even though they were very well known in their day.  But the important thing is that every single voice is pitch perfect for the part.  The epitome of this is obviously Phil Harris who provided the booming voice of Baloo.  I must confess that Baloo is probably my favorite Disney character of all time and I can't conceive of anyone else bringing the easy charm and warmth that Harris just radiated with that incredible voice of his.The characters are all interesting and likable.  The malicious Shere Khan comes across as incredibly suave with a wry wit that is quite funny at times.  Even relatively minor characters like Colonel Hathi and King Louie are memorable and enjoyable.  This is partly because of the excellent voice acting and partly because of the unusually sharp script.  The story moves along at a brisk pace and more than holds the interest of adults and children alike.  Mowgli seems to get in one mess after another and the jungle provides a great source of these situations.The music is yet another high point.  The soundtrack features several tunes that are very catchy and fun.  Some are well remembered such as ""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You.""  But even less featured songs such as ""Colonel Hathi's March"" and ""That's What Friends Are For"" burn themselves quite pleasantly into your brain.If The Jungle Book has a fault, it is in the animation.  The movie was made just as Disney started cutting major corners in their animation and it shows.  The character animations are definitely more sketchy and rough than you would see in a movie like Lady and the Tramp when they were more meticulous.  Fortunately, the character design was still flawless and the quality of art had not yet diminished to the extent that it would in the 1970s when the company's animation hit rock bottom.My final verdict on The Jungle Book is that it is as entertaining an animated film as you're ever likely to see.  In many aspects of its production, it remains one of the true greats and I would recommend it to anyone of any age.  The story is interesting, the characters and voices are incredible, and the music is as catchy as any soundtrack you'll hear.

After Walt retired from this position, the individuals who came in his place were more concerned with saving money, recycling animation and doing everything cheap and quick (pshh, typical suits). This was NOT the motto of Walt Disney, which is why under his wing the best animation the world has ever seen was produced. Unfortunately by the time this film came out W.D. had succumbed to lung cancer, so he was never able to see the final cut of the film. Although this was during the period of cheap animation, it's obvious when the animation is this scratchy and unclean, the story was good, the songs were great catchy jazzy tunes, voice acting was on par contributing to the overall saving of the movie. Now every Disney movie in the world has their own fan base, there are movies lots of people love and movies not as many people love, but every Disney film is loved for one reason or another. The movies were also being much less produced then they had previously been, there were as many Disney films in the 1950's as there was from 1960 to the beginning of the new Disney Renaissance (1984-1994). Because of the quality of the films and reception after creating such great and seminal films as Cinderella how they could go to make hardly mediocre movies like The Aristocats?",4,Life A.D.

426382,A10G4BPT5MGBHY,6304500831,Julie Neal,"[29, 34]","With so many Disney DVDs to choose from, is ""The Jungle Book,"" even a new ""Platinum"" version, really a must buy?Absolutely. Just 78 minutes long, this unpretentious adventure is full of imaginative characters, charming song and dance routines, interesting themes and innocent good humor. Unlike many Disney films, ""The Jungle Book"" doesn't strive to be high art and has no groundbreaking special effects, but it's still one of the company's best animated films. And now the film has now been ""digitally enhanced,"" with a brighter contrast and cleaner colors.Telling the tale of Mowgli, a human boy brought up in the jungles of India, the movie is a freewheeling adaptation of some Victorian-era short stories by British writer Rudyard Kipling. Rescued as an infant by a protective panther named Bagheera, the boy is raised by wolves and adopted by a carefree bachelor bear, Baloo. Disney punches up the stories with Western jokes and music (the pop soundtrack includes Baloo's and orangutan King Louie's infectious scat duet ""I Wanna Be Like You"" and Baloo's perky prickly pear primer, ""The Bear Necessities""), but wisely eliminates Kipling's patronizing overtones.""The Jungle Book"" teaches children a number of good life lessons. It demonstrates that the world includes enemies as well as friends, and that enemies sometimes disguise themselves as friends. It argues that though its fun to pretend you're someone you're not, it's best to accept the person you are.It has two lessons about love. First, that true love is unselfish, as Baloo learns when he realizes he must finally return Mowgli to the ""man village."" And second, as Mowgli realizes in the final scene, that the ultimate male fulfillment is the love of a good woman. Or, as my husband views the segment, the pursuit of a wide-eyed flirt.Parents can take note of a classic Disney touch: the acceptance of both religion and science. The film begins with the infant Mowgli lying in a basket along a riverbank, a reference to Moses that's not in the Kipling stories. Later, however, there's a nod to Darwin, as the orangutan King Louie greets the human boy with an outstretched hand, saying ""Shake hands, cousin.""If nothing else, adults can enjoy identifying the distinctive character voices (Kaa is voiced by Sterling Holloway, the Cheshire Cat in ""Alice in Wonderland"" and best known as Winnie the Pooh) or laughing at the chorus of Beatle-like vultures. One looks just like Ringo. Sounds like him, too.If you're a fan of the story you may also want to check out Disney's live-action (and non-musical) version, 1994'sRudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. Though it's a little violent for younger kids (one soldier is sucked under a pond of quicksand and dies a slow death), this PG film is not really scary and quite the exotic adventure.

Not like the animated flicks of today, with celebrities hitching to the voice wagon, just so they can tell their precocious offspring- ""Look daddy (or in some cases Grandpappy) is the voice of Fester the Fish!""

Each frame of the film is picture postcard perfect.  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say-I loved this DVD!  Now I'm waiting with bated breath for the spring release of 101 Dalmations.

I remember cackling like a fool in the theatres when it was released. It's a film that doesn't really require to much dissecting as the script is so witty and the voiceovers fit the characters with many nuances, facial expressions and comedic interplays that are just too funny for words!As an artist myself, I have such a profound appreciation for the thousands of hand drawings and watercolors it took to produce this full length animation. I have often thought of how much fun it would have been to be an artist on staff during that era (Jungle Book, Robin Hood, Aristocrats etc.) and can only imagine the laughter that must have gone on during staff meetings with all the 'brainstorming' and artwork in progress as decisions were made on characterizations. The blend of British voiceovers in this release (""Bagheera"" and ""Shere Khan"" played to perfection by Sabastian Cabot and George Sanders respectively) combined with the blustering Southern style of Phil Harris as ""Baloo"" the bear really added to the entertainment value and yielded some VERY NICE results. (And of course, the musical scores/talent of the Sherman brothers goes without saying :o)The print quality on this Blu ray release is absolutely beautiful with eye popping color and crisp vibrant detail.

But he can't stand to do that, so he makes sure the boy is adopted by a family of wolves.  As a result, Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) feels completely comfortable in the jungle.  He loves his home.Unfortunately, trouble is brewing.  The tiger Shere Khan (George Sanders) has returned to the area and wants to kill Mowgli.  For his own good, the wolf pack decides to have Mowgli return to the man village.Mowgli doesn't want to go, however, and makes life very difficult on Bagheera, who has agreed to take him.  In his efforts to stay in the jungle, he crosses paths with Baloo, a jungle bum of a bear (Phil Harris), King Louie the monkey (Louis Prima), a military pack of elephants, a boa constrictor with sinus problems (Sterling Holloway), and four vultures with perfect harmony.  But will he leave the jungle?  Is Shere Khan on his trail?The part of me that is still a kid still loves this movie.  It's got some great laughs and lots of fun songs.

Of course, by that point, they're probably be newer, better editions out!I didn't really remember much about this movie, apart from the songs. But as soon as it started, it all came flooding back. It was never my favourite Disney movie, and it was also Walt Disney's last movie, before he died. There are also a few problems with this movie - a couple of scenes are directly lifted from previous films (the scene where Mowgli is met by his 'family' is the same as the scene from Sword In The Stone), Phil Harris who did the voice of Baloo went on to voice the Little John character in Robin Hood, and the snake is the same in this film as in Robin Hood again. It feels almost lazy at some points, but they're using the same artists, so it does feel quite familiar at some points.Why was Jungle Book never my favourite Disney movie? I'm not quite sure about that one, it just never appealed to me as much as some of the others. I never really enjoyed the book either.I got the UK edition of the DVD, which comes with the 2 disc DVD, and also a book.

426419,A38ZTUNQJVGP6S,6304500831,Michael Patrick Boyd,"[0, 0]","The Jungle Book is one hour and one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in theaters on October 18, 1967. This would be the last movie that Walt Disney personally oversaw. Basically the movie tells the story about a boy, Mowgli, who is raised by wolves in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is ten years later and the tribe of wolves feels that the man cub must be sent to the human village because Shere Khan, a tiger, has return and they feel that they cannot protect the boy. Bagheera, a black leopard, offers to take the boy cub to the man village and that where the adventure begins. Mowgli does not want to live in the man village and wants to stay in the jungle.Bagheera tries to explain to Mowgli, but he does not listen. Mowgli finds several different animals who would like to get closer to him for different reasons. Mowgli first meet Kaa, a giant Indian Python, and Kaa wants nothing more then to eat the child. Kaa fails in the two attempts when he is with the boy. Next he is met by Baloo, a sloth bear, and Baloo is a care free, fun loving bear who lives one day at a time. Baloo immediately takes a liking to Mowgli and wants to raise him a bear also. Later on in the movie Bagheera informs Baloo the truth as to why he can't raise him because of Shere Khan. While Mowgli and Baloo are enjoying life, Mowgli is kidnapped by a group of orangutans and is brought back to their leader - King Louie. King Louie wants the boy cub to teach on how to acquire the red flower (fire). King Louie plans are crushed when Baloo and Bagheera comes to rescue Mowgli. It is about ' into the movie that the main villain appears - Shere Khan. Shere Khan wants to kill the boy because he hates man and that includes women also. I will not go into how the story ends because of the criticism I have gotten in the past, but I will tell you that the movie had no ended and it was Walt Disney himself that came up with the ended himself.The movie version of the Jungle Book differs greatly from the book version. In the book version there is no King Louie no vultures and the only resemblance to the book is the names used in the movie. Walt thought the book was too dark for children and instructed his animation department not to read the book. The Jungle Book was nominate for an Academy Award in 1967 for Best Song, The Bare Necessities, but lost out to Doctor Dolittle for Talk to the Animals. Gregory Peck tried to get the movie nominated and win for the Best Picture category, but the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Science felt that animation films did not belong in that category. It would not be until 1992 when Beauty and the Beast would be nominated for an Academy in the Best Picture category. The Jungle Book is a delightful movie for all ages and gets an AAAAA+++++.DVD EXTRASChapter Selection1. Set Up2. Spoken Languagesa. Englishb. Frenchc. Spanish3. Captions4.

It is so hard to know with these Disney movies as I watch them with my daughter.  Some of the songs seem familiar, but is it from watching the movie?  We only got to see them every couple years or so on the Sunday night movie.This movie, which was released the same year I was born, is much more fresh and young than I am.  First- another Disney remastering where the film is absolutely flawless, crisp, and colorful.  The soundtrack is good as well.As for the film and story and music, this is one of the best from Disney.  Watching Baloo dance and sing the Bare Necessities is so enjoyable for adults and kids.  When Baloo puts on his ""disguise"" at the ruins and starts to dance with King Louie, he steals the show.All the songs are great, but my favorite is King Louie's ""I Wanna Be Like You"".  If there is one flaw with the whole DVD, it is the music video for that song by a youngish rock band, and it is a bad version.  Louis Prima's original is so good, perhaps nobody could top it, but this isn't even close.  Disney has done much better with some of the extra music videos on the other DVDs.One special touch of all these Disney movies, is compeletely unintentional, is ""spotting"" or hearing the voice actors in the various roles in the various movies.  In this one, of course you have Sebastian Cabot, but the one I really love is Sterling Holloway as Kaa the boa.  Holloway a decade later would go on to be Winnie the Pooh and you can always hear him as Pooh, so to hear Pooh's voice come out of the evil Kaa, is just delightful.

426425,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6304500831,Monty Moonlight,"[7, 8]","A majestic black panther named Bagheera comes across a human baby all alone in an Indian jungle. Concerned for the child's wellbeing, he delivers it to a family of wolves in the hopes that they will take him in as one of their own. They do, and the boy, Mowgli, grows up happily among the animals as a creature of the jungle. But when the ferocious, man-hating tiger Shere Khan returns to the area on a mission to kill the boy, Mowgli's animal friends must conspire to return him to the safety of the man-village from whence he came.Bagheera and Mowgli set forth on the long journey to the village and encounter some of Disney's greatest characters along the way. The best one being, without a doubt, Baloo the bear, who immediately adopts Mowgli after the boy discovers the purpose of his excursion with Bagheera and refuses to continue. Mowgli is happy where he is, and Baloo is all set to teach his new man-cub how to be a bear and live off the bare necessities. However, with such dangers as Kaa the hypnotic python, King Louie the would-be pyromaniac orangutan and his monkey troupe, and of course the menacing, deadly Shere Khan lurking about in search of the boy, even the carefree Baloo will have to take into consideration what is best for the child.Truly one of the finest Disney animated features of all-time, and possibly my favorite from Walt's day (though, that's a very tough call), ""The Jungle Book"" is a must have for anyone who loves Disney animation or just animation in general! This is still considered some of the finest character animation of all-time! And that's what ""The Jungle Book"" is all about, the characters! The plot is simple, no doubt about that. It's a road-trip through the jungle with survival being the key concern. There's more emotion and entertainment to it than you might think though, thanks to those outstanding character creations! This film has plenty of laughs and heart, and some of the best music you've ever heard (thanks to the Sherman Brothers, Terry Gilkyson, and George Bruns)! Wonderfully directed by Disney animation legend Wolfgang Reitherman, whose son Bruce was the voice of Mowgli, and guided by the master himself, Walt Disney, as the last animated feature he would personally oversee, ""The Jungle Book"" was deservedly an instant smash success! The virtually ""living"" animation and simple storytelling demonstrate Disney filmmaking at its best, and one of the songs (Bare Necessities) even earned an Academy Award Nomination! And for those who think casting big-name celebs in animated films detracts from the overall effect, it certainly didn't hurt this Disney Masterpiece! The cast roster includes such folks as Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, George Sanders, and even Clint Howard, among others! It was even intended to use the Beatles as the voices of the vultures, but I guess they felt they were bigger than Jungle Book. Oh well, I always preferred The Monkees myself! Though, this film features a different kind of monkey.Without a doubt, if you own a DVD player, you should own this DVD, and ""The Jungle Book"" has never looked better! This newly restored version, presented here in a widescreen format that gives us less on the top and bottom (but more on the sides) than the old, bare-bones release, looks and sounds great and is loaded with extras spread out over 2-discs. Before I get to the extras though, I know everyone is concerned about the aspect ratio thing. Well, there seems to be debate over whether Disney should have gone the matted route. Some say the film was intended to be cropped into a widescreen version for its theatrical release, some argue that it was not. Clearly, Disney should have included both options in this set, but my best advice is to not throw your Limited Issue ""Jungle Book"" DVD out if this is a problem for you. I probably will hang on to mine. Of course, most of you probably don't have the L.I. DVD, but whether you do or not, don't hesitate to pick up this newer edition. The picture, matted as it is, looks amazing, and the extras are so great. Sure, there could have been more. Disney has somewhat slacked off on the Platinum Editions most of the time in comparison to the initial Snow White release, but there is still a lot of must have stuff for the Jungle Book fan!In addition to the film itself, Disc One holds a wonderful audio commentary with Bruce Reitherman (Mowgli's voice and son of the film's director), composer Richard Sherman, and current Disney master animator and self-professed number one Jungle Book fan Andreas Deja. Archival recordings of animators who worked on the film are also played during the commentary, and it all adds up to one very informative and enjoyable, even touching experience. The first disc also includes the ""Music and More"" section, which holds your standard, cheezy Disney Channel teen update video, this one being the Jonas Brothers performing ""I Wanna Be Like You,"" and a set of three sing-along song selections from the film, as well as two other far more fascinating features. These are a group of audio selections of deleted songs from a very different version of the film that Walt felt was too dark for a Disney animated feature, and a deleted character/scene of a dim-witted rhino named Rocky put together in voiced storyboard format. The deleted scene is quite interesting to watch, especially with its more Beatle-esque version of ""That's What Friends Are For,"" but overall it's not something that you'll regret having been cut. The deleted songs, on the other hand, are a bit more substantial and bring to mind the much earlier, live-action ""Jungle Book"" film starring Sabu. Besides all that great stuff, there is a promo for the Disney Wildlife Worldwide Conservation Fund, and the disc is also enhanced with Disney Fast Play for the kiddies.Disc Two features the bulk of the extras, of course, the main one being the expected ""Making-Of"" featurette, ""The Bare Necessities: The Making of The Jungle Book."" This is an excellent 46 and half (or so) minute featurette full of great interviews and with a really tear-jerking section that goes into Walt's death during the making of the film. It really is a captivating watch, and it can be viewed in sections if one chooses. Other featurettes include a first-rate comparison between Disney's version of the film and the original works of Rudyard Kipling, ""The Lure of the Jungle Book,"" in which we get to see modern animators reminisce about what ""The Jungle Book"" has meant to them and their careers, ""Mowgli's Return to the Wild,"" a featurette about Bruce Reitherman's current life as a nature filmmaker and his reflections on his father, and finally ""Frank and Ollie,"" which is not the feature-length documentary of the same title available on its own DVD, but rather a brief carry over from the Jungle Book laserdisc previously referred to as ""Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston Discuss Character Animation."" Besides the featurettes, there is one more group of extras that falls under the heading of ""The Man Village"" (as Disc Two is divided into two sections), and that is the Art Galleries. These are what you have come to expect from Disney Platinum releases and are all very appreciated by us Disney animation fanatics, of course. The other section of Disc Two falls under the heading of ""Jungle Fun,"" and, to be honest, it's mostly just for the kids, though I do like the Disneypedias. The bulk of the section is 4 games that can be played as one long game, but I had trouble playing them on my player (which probably has more to do with the player than the disc) and I wasn't too interested anyway. I'd rather have trivia games if anything. There's also some sort of English teaching game that is separate from those others. Now, that was in interesting inclusion. I think it could work to teach any kids the names of animals though. As I said, there is a Disneypedia in this section, which is sort of like a Disney-fied Animal Planet program (running just under 15 minutes). Here, we get to see and learn about the real animals and locations from the film, and while it's aimed at kids too, it can also be enjoyed by adults.While the DVD extras do lack any theatrical trailers for the feature itself and movie poster art in the gallery section, this still adds up to a fantastic, must-own DVD, as are all the Disney Platinum Edition releases. I suppose that's the real reason why Disney hasn't been putting as much into them as they could lately. Even with less content than the earlier Platinums, they still are amazing sets, especially compared to the original, bare bones releases. ""The Jungle Book"" was released in 1967, by the way, almost a full year after Walt's death. It is inarguably one of his greatest achievements. In 2003, Disney released an all new sequel to theaters, ""The Jungle Book 2."" Despite what most hardcore Disney fans would say, I feel there was great potential in a sequel to the '67 classic. We still hadn't seen what life was like for Mowgli in the Man-Village, and here was the opportunity. Unfortunately, as with most of the sequels to Disney classics, the film was made strictly with a child audience in mind, and it didn't meet its full potential. Also, some great characters weren't included and colors were just plain wrong. It was a theatrical release that looked more like a better-than-average direct-to-video release. While it's not without a certain level of entertainment value, most adult viewers will probably only find merit in this original Masterpiece. If you have to have more of Baloo, Louie, and Shere Khan though, you might first want to pick up the 1990 television series ""TaleSpin"" on DVD. That is, if you don't mind Baloo being transformed into a 1930's aviator in a world of anthropomorphic animals, ha. It really is a wonderful show. There was also a later program more loyal to the Jungle Book setting but featuring the main animal characters as children. It was called ""Jungle Cubs,"" and it was a cute show for the younger set, but it's still not available for purchase. Various live-action Jungle Book films also exist (both by Disney and other studios), and there is a fine cartoon short by Chuck Jones entitled ""Mowgli's Brothers."" Of course, the 1967 Disney animated classic is as good as it gets!",5,This DVD is a Bare Necessity!

426426,A3AHVZM2SMJTBK,6304500831,"moose2000 ""Michael Miller""","[0, 0]","I would say Snow White is Disney's greatest accomplishment--especially considering a full-length animated feature had never been done. Sleeping Beauty had the best backgrounds. The Jungle Book has the best characters.

I guess I do though, because it doesnt bother me it wasnt released in widescreen, but still looks like an updated version of the VHS copy, which I had. So does Cinderella, play the same way, sooooo, so what. I'll say this one thing, Sleeping Beauty is presented in widescreen ratio, and I still use the ZOOM in my remote to bring the picture back to full screen. It seems I would rather be close to the characters, and the action, rather than appreciate the panoramic look. I think the portable dvd players, however, do manage to play with the panoramic look because of formatting.

The film has been CROPPED from its original release. They have chopped off sections of the film to give it the look of widescreen. Jungle Book was never shown in widescreen so this is an altered image. I have no idea why Disney can't truthfully RESTORE a film. Admittedly the picture quality and sound are great. But I expect Disney to restore a film properly and actually DO IT. It seems that you can not post images here but there are links below to image comparisons of the original release and the DVD version. Yes the color is good and the image has been cleaned up. But especially look at the parts of the animation that have been cut off. Especially when it is parts of characters. Disney, at least offer us a choice of how we want to see the film. As it was originally intended, with all the artwork and labor of the artists included. Or your way, with chopped off images and distorted picture to falsely accommodate those with widescreen TVs. Take note that those of us that bought widescreen TVs did so so we could appreciate films as they were made as some were indeed in widescreen.

426478,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,6304500831,Stephen M. Lerch,"[3, 3]","This is a very good release, collecting all of the old video extras from the original DVD and bringing more new material to the table.The reason it is not a 5 star rating is because of the aspect ratio. According to IMDB, The film was created with a 1.37 negative ratio, meaning it was intended most likely for 1.33 (4:3) displays. Also according to IMDB, the intended display was 1.75, which means a cropping of the top and bottom of the 1.37 frame to allow for widescreen. In my mind, the negative ratio is the proper ratio and anything else is just plain wrong. Unfortunately, Disney chose to follow the &#34;intended display&#34; format for this release, meaning the top/bottom are cropped for widescreen, which definitely isn't cool. Losing information so that people who expect their widescreen TV to be filled with picture is an abomination.One thing to be aware of is that Disney chose to perform digital noise reduction on this film as well. While they did manage to maintain and retain fine detail on lines, unlike Sword in the Stone (don't buy that on Blu Ray, seriously), they also scrub all of the film grain out. This is kind of disappointing as well because grain is part of film, and removing grain, no matter how carefully it is performed, will always destroy some detail in the picture.In terms of the sound, they did a fantastic job. The 7.1 mix is crystal clear. And for purists, despite not getting a pure, uncropped image, you can at least listen to the audio in the original recorded mono version.Overall, the Jungle Book on Blu Ray is a good release, if you can look past the aspect ratio.",4,Good release,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,1613,"['very', 'good', 'release', 'collecting', 'old', 'video', 'extras', 'original', 'DVD', 'bringing', 'more', 'new', 'material', 'table.The', 'reason', 'not', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'According', 'IMDB', 'film', 'was', 'created', '1.37', 'negative', 'ratio', 'meaning', 'was', 'intended', 'most', 'likely', '1.33', '4:3', 'displays', 'Also', 'according', 'IMDB', 'intended', 'display', 'was', '1.75', 'cropping', 'top', 'bottom', '1.37', 'frame', 'allow', 'widescreen', 'mind', 'negative', 'ratio', 'proper', 'ratio', 'anything', 'else', 'just', 'plain', 'wrong', 'Unfortunately', 'Disney', 'chose', 'follow', '34', 'intended', 'display', '34', 'format', 'release', 'meaning', 'top/bottom', 'are', 'cropped', 'widescreen', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'cool', 'Losing', 'information', 'people', 'who', 'expect', 'widescreen', 'TV', 'be', 'filled', 'picture', 'abomination.One', 'thing', 'be', 'aware', 'Disney', 'chose', 'perform', 'digital', 'noise', 'reduction', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'manage', 'maintain', 'retain', 'fine', 'detail', 'lines', 'Sword', 'Stone', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'seriously', 'also', 'scrub', 'film', 'grain', 'out', 'kind', 'disappointing', 'as', 'well', 'grain', 'part', 'film', 'removing', 'grain', 'matter', 'how', 'carefully', 'performed', 'will', 'always', 'destroy', 'detail', 'picture.In', 'terms', 'sound', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', '7.1', 'mix', 'crystal', 'clear', 'purists', 'not', 'getting', 'pure', 'uncropped', 'image', 'can', 'least', 'listen', 'audio', 'original', 'recorded', 'mono', 'version.Overall', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'good', 'release', 'can', 'look', 'aspect', 'ratio']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

And animated movies all started with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. And this movie is kind of like both Tarzan and George of the Jungle all in one. As the movie opens, a panther named Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot) finds a lost man cub all along in the jungle. So he brings the baby to a pack of woods and about a few years later the baby now growing into about 5 maybe 10 years old man cub named Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman). But Mowgli has to go to a man village because a tiger named Shere Khan has return to the jungle and is going to kill Mowgli because he hates hunters with gun and fire. But Mowgli wants to stay in the jungle, and finally Bageera gives up a lets him be on his own. And he meets a bear named Baloo (Phil Harris).

426480,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,6304500831,Steven Aldersley,"[7, 9]","Although Bambi, Dumbo and Lady and the Tramp are my favorite classic Disney titles, The Jungle Book holds a special place in my heart. My mother took me and my brother to see it on the big screen shortly before she died, and it was the only animated Disney film we saw together at the cinema. I remember that we were late and missed a few minutes, so we watched the rest of the film, Treasure Island, and then sat through all of The Jungle Book again afterwards. I only asked to see the few minutes we had missed, but we couldn't bring ourselves to leave at that point.I don't think I have seen the film since that day around 40 years ago, so I wondered whether my treasured memory would be ruined by seeing it again as an adult. I'm happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Walt Disney's last major animated film is a feel-good story suitable for the whole family. The story is simple: Mowgli is a small child who is discovered by Bagheera the panther in the Indian Jungle. After giving the matter some thought, he decides that the local wolves would provide the best home for the boy. Ten years quickly pass during a narrated scene and we skip ahead to the current day. The wolves have heard that the tiger, Shere Khan, is back in the neighborhood. He hates humans and will likely seek out Mowgli to kill him. Don't worry, I promise that your children won't be frightened by the story.Mowgli is befriended by a small elephant, and also has the help of Bagheera, who decides to deliver the boy to a village so that he can be among his own kind. Along the way they encounter Baloo the bear, who is the life and soul of the film. He's not too bright, but his heart is in the right place and it's easy to love him.Like most Disney classics, the story contains plenty of songs. The most notable is Bare Necessities, sung by Baloo, and it was nominated for an Oscar. There are four other songs, including King of the Swingers, which is almost as much fun as Bare Necessities.The 78-minute story seems to be over all too quickly, but you could always watch it twice as I did all those years ago. I could imagine small children loving the colors, the music, and the bright characters that populate the entire movie.The Diamond Edition  Blu-ray boasts a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, as well as the original mono track, and 5.1 Dolby Digital versions in French, Spanish and Portuguese. The picture is free of dirt and debris and looks as clear as a watercolor painting could possibly look. Be aware that these hand-painted Disney classics do not have the depth of modern CGI images, but the story is strong enough to make you focus on what's happening in the foreground. I was very happy with the presentation.As well as features from the Classic DVD, this latest version includes the following:Music, Memories and Mowgli: A Conversation with Richard M. Sherman, Diane Disney Miller and Floyd Norman (9:42)Alternate Ending - Mowgli and the Hunter (unfinished animation in storyboard form) (8:46)I Wan'na Be Like You: Hanging Out at Disney's Magic Kingdom (18:25)Bear-e-oke (5 songs)@disneyanimation: Sparking Creativity (9:14)The package comes with an embossed slip cover and a DVD.For any Disney fan who hasn't seen The Jungle Book, the Blu-ray is a great way to experience it for the first time. I would also recommend it as an upgrade for owners of the DVD.Movie score 4/5 (Presentation 5/5)",5,The Diamond Edition Blu-ray offers a significant upgrade,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,3401,"['Bambi', 'Dumbo', 'Lady', 'Tramp', 'are', 'favorite', 'classic', 'Disney', 'titles', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'mother', 'took', 'brother', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'shortly', 'died', 'was', 'only', 'animated', 'Disney', 'film', 'saw', 'together', 'cinema', 'remember', 'were', 'late', 'missed', 'few', 'minutes', 'watched', 'rest', 'film', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'then', 'sat', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'again', 'afterwards', 'only', 'asked', 'see', 'few', 'minutes', 'had', 'missed', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'leave', 'point.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'day', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'wondered', 'treasured', 'memory', 'would', 'be', 'ruined', 'seeing', 'again', 'adult', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'experience.Walt', 'Disney', 'last', 'major', 'animated', 'film', 'feel-good', 'story', 'suitable', 'whole', 'family', 'story', 'simple', 'Mowgli', 'small', 'child', 'who', 'discovered', 'Bagheera', 'panther', 'Indian', 'Jungle', 'giving', 'matter', 'thought', 'local', 'wolves', 'would', 'provide', 'best', 'home', 'boy', 'Ten', 'years', 'quickly', 'pass', 'narrated', 'scene', 'skip', 'ahead', 'current', 'day', 'wolves', 'have', 'heard', 'tiger', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'back', 'neighborhood', 'humans', 'will', 'likely', 'seek', 'out', 'Mowgli', 'kill', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'promise', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'frightened', 'story.Mowgli', 'befriended', 'small', 'elephant', 'also', 'help', 'Bagheera', 'who', 'deliver', 'boy', 'village', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'own', 'kind', 'way', 'encounter', 'Baloo', 'bear', 'who', 'life', 'soul', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'easy', 'love', 'him.Like', 'most', 'Disney', 'classics', 'story', 'plenty', 'songs', 'most', 'notable', 'Bare', 'Necessities', 'sung', 'Baloo', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'are', 'four', 'other', 'songs', 'including', 'King', 'Swingers', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'Bare', 'Necessities.The', '78-minute', 'story', 'be', 'too', 'quickly', 'could', 'always', 'watch', 'twice', 'did', 'years', 'ago', 'could', 'imagine', 'small', 'children', 'loving', 'colors', 'music', 'bright', 'characters', 'populate', 'entire', 'movie.The', 'Diamond', 'Edition', 'Blu-ray', '7.1', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'track', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'mono', 'track', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'versions', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'picture', 'free', 'dirt', 'debris', 'as', 'clear', 'watercolor', 'painting', 'could', 'possibly', 'look', 'Be', 'aware', 'hand-painted', 'Disney', 'classics', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'depth', 'modern', 'CGI', 'images', 'story', 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'focus', 'what', 'happening', 'foreground', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'presentation.As', 'well', 'features', 'Classic', 'DVD', 'latest', 'version', 'following', 'Music', 'Memories', 'Mowgli', 'Conversation', 'Richard', 'M.', 'Sherman', 'Diane', 'Disney', 'Miller', 'Floyd', 'Norman', '9:42', 'Alternate', 'Ending', 'Mowgli', 'Hunter', 'unfinished', 'animation', 'storyboard', 'form', '8:46', ""Wan'na"", 'Be', 'Hanging', 'Out', 'Disney', 'Magic', 'Kingdom', '18:25', 'Bear-e-oke', '5', 'songs', '@', 'disneyanimation', 'Sparking', 'Creativity', '9:14', 'package', 'embossed', 'slip', 'cover', 'DVD.For', 'Disney', 'fan', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Blu-ray', 'great', 'way', 'experience', 'first', 'time', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'upgrade', 'owners', 'DVD.Movie', 'score', '4/5', 'Presentation', '5/5']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

I would like to point out that Amazon has a policy of combining all formats of a film (theater, DVD, Bluray and Amazon Instant) together when providing reviews. I always recommend that those seeking a review of a DVD or Bluray sort by date &#8211; you can choose &#8220;newest first&#8221;  - and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing.  Some of the reviews here go back to 2007 even before Bluray! This review is of the Bluray Combo pack version (including the &#8220;Bonus Features&#8221;).I won&#8217;t spend a lot of time discussing the film itself because &#8211; honestly &#8211; it&#8217;s a classic. Yes, it&#8217;s only 78 minutes long (just over an hour) but it has five great songs in it. I&#8217;ll let you read others comments on the story ( an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling&#8217;s stories) but I&#8217;ll point out that one of the NEW &#8220;special features&#8221; this time is an 8-minute featurette where we see the &#8220;story booked&#8221;  version  of a recently discovered &#8220;alternate ending&#8221;, which is narrated by one of the new generation of Disney animators.The Bluray version looks great. It&#8217;s really sharp. Of course, it is so sharp that the black outlines of each hand drawn character (yes, this was made before computers!) are clearly visible. No, I&#8217;m not complaining; just pointing out for the CGI generation.The bonus features are divided into two sections:  The new ones show up first and then there is a section for the &#8220;Classic bonuses&#8221; from prior editions of the films home video release. The new ones include: a nine-minute interview with composer Richard Sherman,  an 18-minute one on the Animal Kingdom Disney Park (only tangentially related to the film), a 9-minute feature on Disney&#8217;s in-house SPARK program where animators can &#8220;pitch &#8220; new ideas to their peers.  And Bear-E-Oke, which lets you sing along to the five songs. This last feature isn&#8217;t that necessary either since the &#8220;Classic Bonuses&#8221; includes the option to jump to the same songs with subtitles to sing along with.  So, honestly, the best bonus is the Sherman interview though an upgrade to this addition - for those who treasure the film and have an HD TV and BD player &#8211; is the print itself.I think Walt would be very happy with this new release of the last film he was personally involved with.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,Review of 2014 BLURAY release &#8211; Looks great and sounds great!

As close as can be expected to Rudyard Kiplings book, The Jungle Book is the story of the boy Mogli who is raised in the jungle by a pack of wolves, with Bagheera the panther as a close family friend.  One day, SherCan the tiger returns to the jungle, with a special hate for mankind.  It is decided that for the wolf pack's safety, Mogli must go.  Bagheera offers to return him to the ""man village"".  Of course, Mogli doesn't want to leave the jungle, the only home he has ever known, so he slips off into the jungle and has a grand adventure.The Jungle Book is a movie that even the adults in our family don't mind watching more than once.  The story is good, the gags are funny, the adventure is gripping (for a children's movie), and the score is really and truly one of the greatest and jazziest ever put to a Disney movie.  In fact, our five year old loves the songs so much, that it sparked an new interest in jazz music in our home with the family!I highly recommend this movie to any family looking for whole-family fare.

On paper, they look pretty skimpy -- especially for a two-disc release -- but in truth, they're pretty good. There's a full-length commentary (though unfortunately many of the principals aren't around to pitch in), and an hour or so of documentaries, and that's not even getting into the games and such, which I have no interest in investigating.My only reservation about the extra material is that it could be a bit better edited -- several of the same anecdotes pop up as many as three times. But I found it interesting to hear (and see), for instance, how Louis Prima and his band performed ""I Wanna Be Like You"" to inspire the Disney artists (though the band was eventually replaced on the soundtrack), and hear the complete earlier score supplied by Terry Gilkyson, which -- other than ""The Bare Necessities"" -- was dropped along with the original conception of the film.",5,Better than it might seem,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,1115,"['Jungle', 'Book', 'praise', 'lot', 'fun', 'hip', 'Disney', 'got', 'least', 'being', 'embarrassing', 'Pixar', 'started', 'figuring', 'occasion.But', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'few', 'words', 'extras', 'paper', 'look', 'pretty', 'skimpy', 'especially', 'two-disc', 'release', 'truth', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'good', 'full-length', 'commentary', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'principals', 'are', ""n't"", 'pitch', 'hour', 'so', 'documentaries', 'not', 'even', 'getting', 'games', 'such', 'have', 'interest', 'investigating.My', 'only', 'reservation', 'extra', 'material', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'better', 'edited', 'several', 'same', 'anecdotes', 'pop', 'up', 'as', 'many', 'three', 'times', 'found', 'interesting', 'hear', 'see', 'instance', 'how', 'Louis', 'Prima', 'band', 'performed', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'inspire', 'Disney', 'artists', 'band', 'was', 'eventually', 'replaced', 'soundtrack', 'hear', 'complete', 'earlier', 'score', 'supplied', 'Terry', 'Gilkyson', 'other', 'Bare', 'Necessities', 'was', 'dropped', 'original', 'conception', 'film']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS
426493,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,6304500831,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[3, 4]","Disney successfully weaved together several of Rudyard Kipling's original jungle stories into a fun-filled adventure for children and adults. Well-received and quite memorable, The Jungle Book is full of unforgettable characters and timeless songs, although it was unable to reach the level of emotion and passion that would later be perfected with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.Bagheera the panther finds an abandoned man cub in a basket and, against his better judgment, delivers it to some fellow wolves to raise as their own. The human child, Mowgli, grows to be a favorite amongst the jungle creatures. But with the news of the return of Shere Kahn, the human-loathing tiger, Bagheera and the others decide it's best if Mowgli is returned to a human village. The boy doesn't want to go, and runs off for adventures with Baloo the bear and King Louie the orangutan before realizing that the jungle really is no place for a human.The characters are very well-crafted and their designs are flawless. In fact, three of the characters were so popular that they were drafted into their own spin-off TV show, Tailspin. Baloo the bear, King Louie of the apes and Shere Kahn the Tiger became more personified versions of themselves in Tailspin, which was also a huge success. The character designs in The Jungle Book paved the way as templates for future Disney characters including many of those in 1994's The Lion King. Other notable aspects of the inspired animation include the voice casting of Kaa the snake, by Winnie the Pooh's Sterling Holloway, and Colonel Hathi, leader of the marching military-like elephants is voiced by Pat O'Malley.The animation in The Jungle Book is incredibly life-like and accurate. From Mowgli's carefree hopping about in the jungle, to Bagheera's lithe lunging from tree to tree, to Kaa's bouncy coils, it is evident that each new animated feature by Disney gets more precise and impressive. The last film to be personally supervised by Walt Disney, The Jungle Book was ensured to focus on those important animation details as well as a great story. Not following a particular Rudyard Kipling story, but combining the most intriguing bits of several ideas, only Disney could create such a timeless tale of adventure, laughs and music. The film features several of the most catchy and sing-along songs ever written, including ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wan'na Be Like You.""The animation is wondrous, but with the lack of shadows and with glaringly noticeable solid colors on each of the characters, it is evident that much improvement could be made in the future. And while 1989 marked the return of Disney's winning streak with The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, The Jungle Book marked one of the last of a run of great animated features up to 1967.The 2-disc Platinum Edition of the Jungle Book boasts all-new digitally restored picture and sound, games and activities, the unveiling of a long-lost character dubbed ""Rocky the Rhino,"" deleted songs and a making-of featurette.- Mike Massie",4,The Jungle Book Platinum Edition Review,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,3064,"['Disney', 'successfully', 'weaved', 'together', 'several', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'original', 'jungle', 'stories', 'fun-filled', 'adventure', 'children', 'adults', 'Well-received', 'quite', 'memorable', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'full', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'timeless', 'songs', 'was', 'unable', 'reach', 'level', 'emotion', 'passion', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'perfected', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Beauty', 'Beast.Bagheera', 'panther', 'abandoned', 'man', 'cub', 'basket', 'better', 'judgment', 'fellow', 'wolves', 'raise', 'own', 'human', 'child', 'Mowgli', 'be', 'favorite', 'amongst', 'jungle', 'creatures', 'news', 'return', 'Shere', 'Kahn', 'human-loathing', 'tiger', 'Bagheera', 'others', 'decide', 'best', 'Mowgli', 'returned', 'human', 'village', 'boy', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'off', 'adventures', 'Baloo', 'bear', 'King', 'Louie', 'orangutan', 'realizing', 'jungle', 'really', 'place', 'human.The', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well-crafted', 'designs', 'are', 'flawless', 'fact', 'three', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'popular', 'were', 'drafted', 'own', 'spin-off', 'TV', 'show', 'Tailspin', 'Baloo', 'bear', 'King', 'Louie', 'apes', 'Shere', 'Kahn', 'Tiger', 'became', 'more', 'personified', 'versions', 'Tailspin', 'was', 'also', 'huge', 'success', 'character', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'paved', 'way', 'templates', 'future', 'Disney', 'characters', 'including', 'many', '1994', 'Lion', 'King', 'Other', 'notable', 'aspects', 'inspired', 'animation', 'include', 'voice', 'casting', 'Kaa', 'snake', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Sterling', 'Holloway', 'Colonel', 'Hathi', 'leader', 'marching', 'military-like', 'elephants', 'voiced', 'Pat', ""O'Malley.The"", 'animation', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'incredibly', 'life-like', 'accurate', 'Mowgli', 'carefree', 'hopping', 'jungle', 'Bagheera', 'lithe', 'lunging', 'tree', 'tree', 'Kaa', 'bouncy', 'coils', 'evident', 'new', 'animated', 'feature', 'Disney', 'more', 'precise', 'impressive', 'last', 'film', 'be', 'personally', 'supervised', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'was', 'ensured', 'focus', 'important', 'animation', 'details', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'story', 'Not', 'following', 'particular', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'story', 'combining', 'most', 'intriguing', 'bits', 'several', 'ideas', 'only', 'Disney', 'could', 'create', 'such', 'timeless', 'tale', 'adventure', 'music', 'film', 'several', 'most', 'catchy', 'sing-along', 'songs', 'ever', 'written', 'including', 'Bear', 'Necessities', ""Wan'na"", 'Be', 'animation', 'wondrous', 'lack', 'shadows', 'glaringly', 'noticeable', 'solid', 'colors', 'characters', 'evident', 'much', 'improvement', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'future', '1989', 'marked', 'return', 'Disney', 'winning', 'streak', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Lion', 'King', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'marked', 'one', 'last', 'run', 'great', 'animated', '1967.The', '2-disc', 'Platinum', 'Edition', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'all-new', 'digitally', 'restored', 'picture', 'sound', 'games', 'activities', 'unveiling', 'long-lost', 'character', 'dubbed', 'Rocky', 'Rhino', 'deleted', 'songs', 'making-of', 'featurette.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

Also, Shere Khan is a great villain, especially because he's a tiger. He's sophisticated, gentlemanly, but evil and deadly at the same time. Kaa is great too.

426500,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,6304500831,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","The Jungle Book is a significant film for several reasons. First, it was the last film that Walt Disney himself was involved in directly. Walt had not been happy with some of the company's recent efforts such as ""Sword in the Stone"" and he took a more hands-on role with Jungle Book. Unfortunately, Disney would not see the fruits of his efforts. He passed away in December 1966, about seven months before the film was released. Still, Disney's handprints are all over the film. Initially conceived as a darker, more dramatic film, and more influenced by Rudyard Kipling's original story, Disney tossed out the idea, along with the original director. The result was the last great Disney animated film before the company was rejuvenated in the 1990's with films like ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"". By anyone's account, their films of the 70's and 80's were lacking the passion of earlier efforts.Yet another significant difference in this movie was the use of major Hollywood talent to supply the voices for most of the characters. This is common practice today but was not the norm in the 1960's. And you probably could not have selected a more eclectic group of actors. At one of the spectrum you have stately British actors Sebastion Cabot as Bagheera the Panther and George Sanders (one of Hollywood's great voices) as the sinister tiger Shere Khan. At the polar opposite was Comedian/actor /bandleader Phil Harris and his southern drawl playing happy-go-lucky bear Baloo, along with Jazz bandleader and swing singer Louis Prima as the voice of orangutan King Louis. Additional voices were provided by Sterling Holloway as Kaa the snake. Holloway is better known for providing the voice of another Disney character, Winnie the Pooh. Ron Howard's brother, Clint, voiced baby elephant Junior. One other footnote, the singing voice of Shere Khan was performed by Thurl Ravenscroft who was the voice of Tony the Tiger, as well as the singer of the ""Grinch"" song.The story oh Jungle Book is simple. Little boy Mowgli was found in the jungle and raised by wolves. But when the wolves find out that the evil Shere Khan is returning to the jungle, they enlist the aid of Bagheera and Baloo to escort Mowgli back to the man village. The only problem is that Mowgli doesn't want to go. He's grown up in the jungle and the animals are his friends and only family. Complicating masters is not one, but three villains. Besides Shere Khan, Kaa and King Louie all want Mowgli for their own reasons. Bagheera and Baloo have to keep him safe from the villains and convince him that the man village is the best place for him.Jungle book contains two of the best songs in Disney history, ""The Bare Necessities"" and the swinging `I Wanna be Like You"". These are timeless songs which were both Oscar-nominated. Not to be forgotten is the menacing and hypnotic ""Trust in Me"" sung by Kaa to Mowgli as he prepares to make a meal of him. It's a fantastic production and the animation is simply gorgeous. Watch the scene when Mowgli is walking by himself through the jungle, kicking at the ground. The fluidity of movement is perfect, and watch how his hair blows in the gentle breeze. 3D animation may be the rage today but there's nothing like outstanding 2D animation.This is the latest Disney classic to get the platinum treatment and while it doesn't have as many special features as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it's still a solid lineup of extras. The making of documentary runs about 45 minutes and includes current and vintage interviews with many of the writers, animators, actors, and the composers who were involved in the project. This takes you through the complete process and there's great footage of Prima and his band dancing about as they perform ""I Wanna Be Like you"". In ""Mowgli's Return to the Jungle"", Bruce Reitherman, the voice of Mowgli, shares his memories of making the film and how the experiences influenced his current job as a wildlife filmmaker. Reitherman's father, Wolfgang, was the film's director.There's an interesting short featurette on a lost character from the film. The near-sighted, short-tempered rhinoceros named Rocky is brought to the screen using original storyboards and original voice recordings by Frank Fontaine. In addition there's a couple of other featurettes, audio commentary, sill gallery, music videos, and games. The word classic is over used today but it definitely applies to The Jungle Book. Forty years later this is still a wonderful film for the whole family.REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",5,A 60'S CLASSIC GOES PLATINUM,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,4537,"['Jungle', 'Book', 'significant', 'film', 'several', 'reasons', 'First', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'involved', 'directly', 'Walt', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'happy', 'company', 'recent', 'efforts', 'such', 'Sword', 'Stone', 'took', 'more', 'hands-on', 'role', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Unfortunately', 'Disney', 'would', 'not', 'see', 'fruits', 'efforts', 'passed', 'away', 'December', '1966', 'about', 'seven', 'months', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Still', 'Disney', 'handprints', 'are', 'film', 'Initially', 'conceived', 'darker', 'more', 'dramatic', 'film', 'more', 'influenced', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'original', 'story', 'Disney', 'tossed', 'out', 'idea', 'original', 'director', 'result', 'was', 'last', 'great', 'Disney', 'animated', 'film', 'company', 'was', 'rejuvenated', '1990', 'films', 'Aladdin', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'anyone', 'account', 'films', '70', '80', 'were', 'lacking', 'passion', 'earlier', 'efforts.Yet', 'significant', 'difference', 'movie', 'was', 'use', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'talent', 'supply', 'voices', 'most', 'characters', 'common', 'practice', 'today', 'was', 'not', 'norm', '1960', 'probably', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'selected', 'more', 'eclectic', 'group', 'actors', 'one', 'spectrum', 'have', 'stately', 'British', 'actors', 'Sebastion', 'Cabot', 'Bagheera', 'Panther', 'George', 'Sanders', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'voices', 'sinister', 'tiger', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'polar', 'opposite', 'was', 'Comedian/actor', '/bandleader', 'Phil', 'Harris', 'southern', 'drawl', 'playing', 'happy-go-lucky', 'bear', 'Baloo', 'Jazz', 'bandleader', 'swing', 'singer', 'Louis', 'Prima', 'voice', 'orangutan', 'King', 'Louis', 'Additional', 'voices', 'were', 'provided', 'Sterling', 'Holloway', 'Kaa', 'snake', 'Holloway', 'better', 'known', 'providing', 'voice', 'Disney', 'character', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'brother', 'Clint', 'voiced', 'baby', 'elephant', 'Junior', 'One', 'other', 'footnote', 'singing', 'voice', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'was', 'performed', 'Thurl', 'Ravenscroft', 'who', 'was', 'voice', 'Tony', 'Tiger', 'as', 'well', 'singer', 'Grinch', 'song.The', 'story', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'simple', 'Little', 'boy', 'Mowgli', 'was', 'found', 'jungle', 'raised', 'wolves', 'when', 'wolves', 'find', 'out', 'evil', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'returning', 'jungle', 'enlist', 'aid', 'Bagheera', 'Baloo', 'escort', 'Mowgli', 'back', 'man', 'village', 'only', 'problem', 'Mowgli', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'grown', 'up', 'jungle', 'animals', 'are', 'friends', 'only', 'family', 'Complicating', 'masters', 'not', 'one', 'three', 'villains', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'Kaa', 'King', 'Louie', 'want', 'Mowgli', 'own', 'reasons', 'Bagheera', 'Baloo', 'have', 'keep', 'safe', 'villains', 'convince', 'man', 'village', 'best', 'place', 'him.Jungle', 'book', 'two', 'best', 'songs', 'Disney', 'history', 'Bare', 'Necessities', 'swinging', 'Wan', 'na', 'be', 'are', 'timeless', 'songs', 'were', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'menacing', 'hypnotic', 'Trust', 'Me', 'sung', 'Kaa', 'Mowgli', 'make', 'meal', 'fantastic', 'production', 'animation', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'Watch', 'scene', 'when', 'Mowgli', 'walking', 'jungle', 'kicking', 'ground', 'fluidity', 'movement', 'perfect', 'watch', 'how', 'hair', 'blows', 'gentle', 'breeze', '3D', 'animation', 'may', 'be', 'rage', 'today', 'nothing', 'outstanding', '2D', 'animation.This', 'latest', 'Disney', 'classic', 'get', 'platinum', 'treatment', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'many', 'special', 'features', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'still', 'solid', 'lineup', 'extras', 'making', 'documentary', 'runs', '45', 'minutes', 'current', 'vintage', 'interviews', 'many', 'writers', 'animators', 'actors', 'composers', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'project', 'complete', 'process', 'great', 'footage', 'Prima', 'band', 'dancing', 'perform', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Mowgli', 'Return', 'Jungle', 'Bruce', 'Reitherman', 'voice', 'Mowgli', 'shares', 'memories', 'making', 'film', 'how', 'experiences', 'influenced', 'current', 'job', 'wildlife', 'filmmaker', 'Reitherman', 'father', 'Wolfgang', 'was', 'film', 'director.There', 'interesting', 'short', 'featurette', 'lost', 'character', 'film', 'near-sighted', 'short-tempered', 'rhinoceros', 'named', 'Rocky', 'brought', 'screen', 'using', 'original', 'storyboards', 'original', 'voice', 'recordings', 'Frank', 'Fontaine', 'addition', 'couple', 'other', 'featurettes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'sill', 'gallery', 'music', 'videos', 'games', 'word', 'classic', 'used', 'today', 'definitely', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Forty', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'wonderful', 'film', 'whole', 'family.REVIEWED', 'BY', 'TIM', 'JANSON']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

What I never experienced as a kid, though, was how absolutely GORGEOUS this movie is.The Blu Ray transfer is a work of art! The jungle foliage provides plenty of opportunity for animators to show off their craft, and they certainly do. This may be one of the most visual Disney movies ever. I was entranced by the animation this go around, with my adult eye, but even still the story is great fun. Not the most complex plot in the Disney canon, but fabulous none the less. Also, the aspect ratio of this movie is 1.75:1 which means it will fill up your whole TV.OVERALL: I buy pretty much all the Disney blu rays, especially anything from the Diamond series, but their new transfers still amaze me. This one exceeded even my high expectations. It truly is like watching it again for the first time. If you've ever been a fan of The Jungle Book, even just a teeny tiny bit, try watching it again in 1080p.

426508,A2PMIMM3U3THM7,6304500831,vqworks,"[4, 4]","Being the last animation that the late Walt Disney was involved with, The Jungle Book is another great classic.  Anyone watching this movie now will immediately be struck by the smooth, flowing movement of the animation, the leisurely and sensible pacing of the story, and the appropriate match between the musical soundtrack and the setting.Current Disney cartoon animations rely too heavily on CGI (computer-generated imagery), frantic pacing and dialog, and employ music that doesn't fit the era or the setting of the plot.  The current character voices also consistently use the same tired urban slang-infused lines even in period pieces.  Walt must be rolling in his grave now.  Don't get me wrong on the choice of music.  The jazz music soundtrack for The Jungle Book wouldn't normally fit a jungle setting but it doesn't stray too far unlike the generic top 40 pop music that peppers period pieces today.  Example: the ""Frozen"" title song against an old European setting.  It's pop with a tinge of....modern country!The Blu-Ray edition of The Jungle Book appears to reveal the same treatment that other classic Disney animations have received.  Color saturation has been increased (probably more than what was originally intended), contrast has been increased, and the overall appearance is more solid and clean.  Personally, I see it as an improvement because it helps to anchor the viewer's attention to the story.  The sound has also been updated to 21st century standards.  Whereas the original release was stereo then later re-released in matrixed Dolby Surround, the current Blu-Ray and DVD versions have been remixed for 5.1 surround.  The result is clean, dynamic, enveloping surround ambience as well as various sound effects appropriately placed in the surround channels according to specific scene details (picture birds flying behind you and King Louie's monkeys taunting Baloo The Bear from behind you while Baloo is in front of you, putting you in the middle of the action).This one's a keeper.",5,A Fresh Look At A Classic,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,2015,"['Being', 'last', 'animation', 'late', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'involved', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'great', 'classic', 'Anyone', 'watching', 'movie', 'now', 'will', 'immediately', 'be', 'struck', 'smooth', 'flowing', 'movement', 'animation', 'leisurely', 'sensible', 'pacing', 'story', 'appropriate', 'match', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'setting.Current', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'animations', 'rely', 'too', 'heavily', 'CGI', 'computer-generated', 'imagery', 'frantic', 'pacing', 'dialog', 'employ', 'music', ""n't"", 'fit', 'era', 'setting', 'plot', 'current', 'character', 'voices', 'also', 'consistently', 'use', 'same', 'tired', 'urban', 'slang-infused', 'lines', 'even', 'period', 'pieces', 'Walt', 'must', 'be', 'rolling', 'grave', 'now', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'choice', 'music', 'jazz', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'fit', 'jungle', 'setting', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'generic', 'top', '40', 'pop', 'music', 'peppers', 'period', 'pieces', 'today', 'Example', 'Frozen', 'title', 'song', 'old', 'European', 'setting', 'pop', 'tinge', '.modern', 'country', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'reveal', 'same', 'treatment', 'other', 'classic', 'Disney', 'animations', 'have', 'received', 'Color', 'saturation', 'been', 'increased', 'probably', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'contrast', 'been', 'increased', 'overall', 'appearance', 'more', 'solid', 'clean', 'Personally', 'see', 'improvement', 'anchor', 'viewer', 'attention', 'story', 'sound', 'also', 'been', 'updated', '21st', 'century', 'standards', 'original', 'release', 'was', 'stereo', 'then', 'later', 're-released', 'matrixed', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'current', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'versions', 'have', 'been', 'remixed', '5.1', 'surround', 'result', 'clean', 'dynamic', 'enveloping', 'surround', 'ambience', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'sound', 'effects', 'appropriately', 'placed', 'surround', 'channels', 'according', 'specific', 'scene', 'details', 'picture', 'birds', 'flying', 'King', 'Louie', 'monkeys', 'taunting', 'Baloo', 'Bear', 'Baloo', 'front', 'putting', 'middle', 'action', 'one', 'keeper']",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

When the threat of Bengal tiger Shere Khan (George Sanders) and his hatred of all things human comes to the jungle, however, Bagheera resolves to place Mowgli in the ""man-village"" once and for all.  Along the way, however, they encounter a crazy cast of characters that includes the singing bear Baloo (Phil Harris), an orangutan king (Louis Prima), and a slithering snake named Kaa (Sterling Holloway).Though the storyline is filled with enough emotion to never truly get old, the hallmarks of this movie are easily its jazz-based soundtrack and one-of-a-kind voice acting.  Every song is catchy in a toe-tapping kind of way, the slow ones add even more emotional depth to the story, and the voices behind the characters are so distinct that they seem to just bring them to life!I watched ""The Jungle Book"" over and over and over again as a child, and can still say that I enjoy it today.
