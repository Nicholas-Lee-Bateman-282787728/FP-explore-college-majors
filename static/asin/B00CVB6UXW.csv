1651289,A2IO4TZ7VU6DPQ,B00CVB6UXW,Stephen Johnston,"[38, 38]","I'm only about 3 or 4 DVD's into this but so far, very impressed. Narrated by Charlton Heston, it's also a joy to listen to. There are 5 x 1hr shows per DVD. The stories vary. Sometimes the producers took poetic license and some clips appear in multiple shows. What did impress me was the quality of the older material. Some was clearly taken from training material or even movies, but even some of the Hitler clips were amazingly clean and crisp. A 1 hour show can sometimes appear to jump around a little but overall the content is wonderful. Explains the war time birth of the pre-CIA and other spy agencies amongst many interesting stories.Honestly, if you're interested in war time secrets and historical data, it's worth every penny. Talking of which for the cost... I simply do not understand how you can go wrong. This is one of the cheapest box sets I've come across but also one of the most outstanding in quality, information and news reel footage.
