982943,A34CC71VP224P8,B000F4RH84,A. Hudson,"[4, 5]",This movie had a good concept but the first part of the movie it was like Vivica Foxx wanted to showcase her body because she's over forty and the acting was not great.  Carmen Electra was okay and Stacy Dash who I didn't know was 39 looks good but her acting is the same from when she was in Mo Money.  Bill Bellemy is still playing the same role but I was glad to see that he has been working out.  Sheryl Underwood must be trying to promote herself since she was in this and Something New which is way better than this movie.  I wouldn't have released this in the theatre too.  I think the ending was a bit cheesy.  It should have ended with the guy getting played in the end.  I'm tired of these movies that try to wrap it in a bow in the end.  Dash should have figured it out and played him and left him in the end.  Then the movie would have been true to the name,2,Only to see on video but not to buy,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,869,"['movie', 'had', 'good', 'concept', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'Vivica', 'Foxx', 'wanted', 'showcase', 'body', 'forty', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'was', 'okay', 'Stacy', 'Dash', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', '39', 'looks', 'good', 'acting', 'same', 'when', 'was', 'Mo', 'Money', 'Bill', 'Bellemy', 'still', 'playing', 'same', 'role', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'Sheryl', 'Underwood', 'must', 'be', 'trying', 'promote', 'was', 'Something', 'New', 'way', 'better', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'released', 'theatre', 'too', 'think', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'guy', 'getting', 'played', 'end', ""'m"", 'tired', 'movies', 'try', 'wrap', 'bow', 'end', 'Dash', 'should', 'have', 'figured', 'played', 'left', 'end', 'Then', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'name']",Getting Played

Jeter ""DwayneJ""","[1, 2]","Getting Played Soundtrack (Who is?)As the title suggests this is not an audio CD or the soundtrack from the movie which is very good but this is the movie.  I have mixed feelings about the choice for lead actor but he did a good job in the roll.  The three ladies were very good with solid performances all around.  The story is a bit unbelievable but the director makes it all work.  As to exactly what you will see, I'm not going to give that away but this is an entertaining movie with a few surprises.  Surprise Vivica takes most of it off and so does Carmen but I really liked the character played by Stacey.  Too agressive can be misinterpreted in a woman and the ""B"" word often slips out.  Obviously this is a love story where true love wins out overall but I'm not happy with the sterotype that all hetero males are ready to jump any attractive woman that comes along but bellamy does a good job playing and getting played to his own harm and near loss of a good thing in Ms Dash.  Also cameos by comedians ""Earthquake"" and Tachina Arnold from the old ""Martin"" sitcom ""Martin Lawrence"" were very funny.",3,Everybody Plays,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,1110,"['Getting', 'Played', 'Soundtrack', 'Who', 'title', 'not', 'audio', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'choice', 'lead', 'actor', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'roll', 'three', 'ladies', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'solid', 'performances', 'around', 'story', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'director', 'work', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'few', 'surprises', 'Surprise', 'Vivica', 'most', 'off', 'so', 'Carmen', 'really', 'liked', 'character', 'played', 'Stacey', 'Too', 'agressive', 'can', 'be', 'misinterpreted', 'woman', 'B', 'word', 'often', 'out', 'Obviously', 'love', 'story', 'where', 'true', 'love', 'out', 'overall', ""'m"", 'not', 'happy', 'sterotype', 'hetero', 'males', 'are', 'ready', 'jump', 'attractive', 'woman', 'along', 'bellamy', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'getting', 'played', 'own', 'harm', 'near', 'loss', 'good', 'thing', 'Ms', 'Dash', 'Also', 'cameos', 'comedians', 'Earthquake', 'Tachina', 'Arnold', 'old', 'Martin', 'sitcom', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'were', 'very', 'funny']",Getting Played
