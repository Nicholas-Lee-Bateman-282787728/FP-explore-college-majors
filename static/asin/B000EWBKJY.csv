979444,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B000EWBKJY,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[6, 6]","Upon seeing the cover of 'Cannibal', you'd expect a low budget gorefest with piss-poor acting, shoddy camerawork, pathetic editing, and at least one fight scene where its obvious that not a single punch even came close to landing.  But what you would be expecting is totally and completely wrong.  'Cannibal' is probably the best psychological thriller I've seen since 'Memento'.  Trust me:  its really that good.The French-Canadian release, originally titled 'La Peau Blanche'('White Skin'), opens with two male roomates, Thierry(a young white college student) and Henri(a black dude with some Haitian relatives who know their hoodoo/voodoo stuff), hooking up with a couple of whores they pick up at a bar.  Henri gets his throat slashed by his whore, Thierry comes running in and the whore jumps out the window.  They then goto the local hospital, where Henri gets stitched up.  For a while, this opening scene seems to mean nothing to the overall film but in fact, ends up becoming very important later.Well, Thierry meets a female musician, Claire, who he's completely enamored with and, as in most movies, they get together and go at it like rabbits on viagra.  The thing is though, that the longer they are together, he starts becoming, well, sort of ill and seems only to want to be with his new lady.  His black pal starts to feel a bit weird about the situation, especially after Claire's obvious dislike for blacks and once he sees her eating the contents of one of Thierry's used condoms.Anyways, Thierry eventually finds out that Claire is dying of cancer and meets her family, which so happens that one of Claire's sisters is the whore who cut Henri's throat.  Claire's family pulls her out of the hospital and Thierry has to track them down.  Henri and his Haitian aunt, who has some shady connections, after being told by Thierry what he knows about Claire's family, believe that she and her clan are succubi(or some other sort of evil being) and must be destroyed.  They go to find them and they do...and so does Thierry.I won't go into anymore detail because I don't want to give anything away.  But 'Cannibal' is an absolutely excellent film.  At the Toronto International Film Festival, Daniel Roby won best director for a debut feature film.  The script is excellent, the cinematography is brilliant, and the acting is excellent, understated, and very realistic.  The camerawork, editing, sound... everything is on-par with any Hollywood release you've ever seen, and on a fraction of the budget.  This is an amazing film that will hook you right from the opening scene up until the last frame.  A fabulous piece of work.  I cannot wait for director Roby's next feature.I'll never understand the marketing ploys that US movie distributors use, but do not be fooled by the silly DVD artwork.  This is an art house film about cannibalism, possibly vampirism, love, and friendship.  Definitely worth seeing, so go rent it.  Better yet:  go buy it.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed",5,Cannibalize This!,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,3006,"['seeing', 'cover', ""'Cannibal"", ""'d"", 'expect', 'low', 'budget', 'gorefest', 'piss-poor', 'acting', 'shoddy', 'camerawork', 'pathetic', 'editing', 'least', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'where', 'obvious', 'not', 'single', 'punch', 'even', 'came', 'close', 'landing', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'expecting', 'totally', 'completely', 'wrong', ""'Cannibal"", 'probably', 'best', 'psychological', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'Memento"", 'Trust', 'really', 'good.The', 'French-Canadian', 'release', 'originally', 'titled', ""'La"", 'Peau', 'Blanche', ""'White"", 'Skin', 'two', 'male', 'roomates', 'Thierry', 'young', 'white', 'college', 'student', 'Henri', 'black', 'dude', 'Haitian', 'relatives', 'who', 'know', 'hoodoo/voodoo', 'stuff', 'hooking', 'up', 'couple', 'whores', 'pick', 'up', 'bar', 'Henri', 'throat', 'slashed', 'whore', 'Thierry', 'running', 'whore', 'out', 'window', 'then', 'goto', 'local', 'hospital', 'where', 'Henri', 'stitched', 'up', 'while', 'opening', 'scene', 'mean', 'nothing', 'overall', 'film', 'fact', 'up', 'becoming', 'very', 'important', 'later.Well', 'Thierry', 'female', 'musician', 'Claire', 'who', 'completely', 'enamored', 'most', 'movies', 'get', 'together', 'go', 'rabbits', 'viagra', 'thing', 'longer', 'are', 'together', 'becoming', 'well', 'sort', 'ill', 'only', 'want', 'be', 'new', 'lady', 'black', 'pal', 'feel', 'bit', 'weird', 'situation', 'especially', 'Claire', 'obvious', 'dislike', 'blacks', 'once', 'eating', 'contents', 'one', 'Thierry', 'used', 'condoms.Anyways', 'Thierry', 'eventually', 'out', 'Claire', 'dying', 'cancer', 'family', 'so', 'one', 'Claire', 'sisters', 'whore', 'who', 'cut', 'Henri', 'throat', 'Claire', 'family', 'out', 'hospital', 'Thierry', 'track', 'down', 'Henri', 'Haitian', 'aunt', 'who', 'shady', 'connections', 'being', 'told', 'Thierry', 'what', 'Claire', 'family', 'believe', 'clan', 'are', 'succubi', 'other', 'sort', 'evil', 'being', 'must', 'be', 'destroyed', 'go', 'find', 'do', 'so', 'Thierry.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'anymore', 'detail', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', ""'Cannibal"", 'absolutely', 'excellent', 'film', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Daniel', 'Roby', 'won', 'best', 'director', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', 'script', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'excellent', 'understated', 'very', 'realistic', 'camerawork', 'editing', 'sound', 'everything', 'on-par', 'Hollywood', 'release', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'fraction', 'budget', 'amazing', 'film', 'will', 'hook', 'right', 'opening', 'scene', 'up', 'last', 'frame', 'fabulous', 'piece', 'work', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'director', 'Roby', 'next', 'feature.I', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'marketing', 'US', 'movie', 'distributors', 'use', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'silly', 'DVD', 'artwork', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'cannibalism', 'possibly', 'vampirism', 'love', 'friendship', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'so', 'go', 'rent', 'Better', 'yet', 'go', 'buy', 'guarantee', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Cannibal

The box art and title of the film are misleading to the extreme. The movie is slow, something that wouldn't be a bad thing if it actually had somewhere to go, but instead it's like driving 1 mph to work: it's not a destination that you're going to get excited about and there's not much to see along the way. The script is lousy and contains more padding than a 12 year old at her first school dance. Want an example of the stupidity? Okay: a character suddenly goes from ""hmmm, there's something fishy going on"" to researching succubi on the Internet. Now, I'm no French-Canadian, but here in the U-S-of A we do not naturally jump to the conclusion that weird things are brought on by medieval demons unless we have some compelling evidence. Don't get all excited about the succubi angle anyway--there's not much in the way of nekkid-ness and what there is isn't very prominent or noteworthy.

979450,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000EWBKJY,Tim Janson,"[4, 5]","First of all the title of the film is totally misleading.  It makes people think that it's perhaps a zombie film when it's nothing at all like that.  As I understand it, the original French title means ""White Skin"".  Obviously some marketing dope thought you could sell more copies by changing the name to ""Cannibal"" in America.  It's a French film...kind of an art house horror film if you will.  It's dubbed, and dubbed rather poorly really, but if you can get by that as well as some other shortcomings you'll probably be pleasantly surprised as I was.  It's really hard to categorize this film and as such somewhat difficult to review.Two roommates Henri and Thierry are out on the town and pick up a couple of hookers in a bar.  While in a motel room, one of the hookers attacks Henri, cutting his throat.  She escapes but we'll find out more about her down the road.  Meanwhile Thierry begins to fall for a girl named Claire.  The better word is obsessed as he wants to spend all of his time with her and yet becomes increasing ill.  Henri isn't happy with the situation and begins to poke around, eventually finding out some rather disturbing things about Claire and her family.  Henri is a Haitian and knows something about voodoo/evil and eventually enlists the aid of a relative because Henri is going to need a LOT of help.  The plot really does surprise as it doesn't end up being what you think it's going to be and therein lies the positive to the film that is able to overcome some of its technical shortcomings.  It's as much psychological thriller as supernatural.  I know dubbing is an immediate turnoff to a lot of people but give this one a shot and you really might be surprised as I was.",4,DISREGARD THE MISLEADING TITLE!,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,1709,"['First', 'title', 'film', 'totally', 'misleading', 'people', 'think', 'perhaps', 'zombie', 'film', 'when', 'nothing', 'understand', 'original', 'French', 'title', 'White', 'Skin', 'Obviously', 'marketing', 'dope', 'could', 'sell', 'more', 'copies', 'changing', 'name', 'Cannibal', 'America', 'French', 'film', 'kind', 'art', 'house', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'dubbed', 'dubbed', 'rather', 'poorly', 'really', 'can', 'get', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'shortcomings', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'categorize', 'film', 'such', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'review.Two', 'roommates', 'Henri', 'Thierry', 'are', 'out', 'town', 'pick', 'up', 'couple', 'hookers', 'bar', 'motel', 'room', 'one', 'hookers', 'attacks', 'Henri', 'cutting', 'throat', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'more', 'road', 'Meanwhile', 'Thierry', 'fall', 'girl', 'named', 'Claire', 'better', 'word', 'obsessed', 'spend', 'time', 'yet', 'becomes', 'increasing', 'ill.', 'Henri', ""n't"", 'happy', 'situation', 'poke', 'around', 'eventually', 'finding', 'out', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'things', 'Claire', 'family', 'Henri', 'Haitian', 'something', 'voodoo/evil', 'eventually', 'aid', 'relative', 'Henri', 'going', 'need', 'LOT', 'help', 'plot', 'really', 'surprise', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'being', 'what', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'therein', 'positive', 'film', 'able', 'overcome', 'technical', 'shortcomings', 'as', 'much', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'supernatural', 'know', 'dubbing', 'immediate', 'turnoff', 'lot', 'people', 'give', 'one', 'shot', 'really', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'was']",Cannibal
