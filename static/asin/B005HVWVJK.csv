1461283,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B005HVWVJK,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]",Bubblegum Crisis is really cool. The futuristic neo-punk setting is unique and the characters are awesome. This was one of the first anime I ever bought and now almost 200 series purchases later I have to say it's still a favorite. This anime is timeless. I've probably watched it through 50 times or so and it never gets old. There's nothing stopping you from buying and loving this show so go for it. You'll really like it.,5,It's really cool!,1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,425,"['Bubblegum', 'Crisis', 'really', 'cool', 'futuristic', 'neo-punk', 'setting', 'unique', 'characters', 'are', 'awesome', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'anime', 'ever', 'bought', 'now', 'almost', '200', 'series', 'purchases', 'later', 'have', 'say', 'still', 'favorite', 'anime', 'timeless', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'watched', '50', 'times', 'so', 'never', 'old', 'nothing', 'stopping', 'buying', 'loving', 'show', 'so', 'go', ""'ll"", 'really', 'like']",Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040: Complete Series Classic
1461284,ALGHX7QQ5J8TY,B005HVWVJK,R. L. Hume,"[1, 1]","My grand daughter likes anime and anything animated which sort of figures since she loves to draw. She usually only watches a little anime with my son & I because most of the stories are focused on male characters.  The only exception that she would watch several episodes of in a row has been Ghost in The Shell, until now. Several friends told me that Bubblegum Crisis was popular and focused on female characters so I got it for my grand daughter as a Christmas gift.  She thinks the series is great, loves the characters, and has watched the whole series through twice already. Well worth the price as a solid entertainment value for your family anime fans in spite of somewhat predictible story lines.",5,Big hit with my daughter & her friends,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,706,"['grand', 'daughter', 'likes', 'anime', 'anything', 'animated', 'sort', 'figures', 'draw', 'usually', 'only', 'little', 'anime', 'son', 'because', 'most', 'stories', 'are', 'focused', 'male', 'characters', 'only', 'exception', 'would', 'watch', 'several', 'episodes', 'row', 'been', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'now', 'Several', 'friends', 'told', 'Bubblegum', 'Crisis', 'was', 'popular', 'focused', 'female', 'characters', 'so', 'got', 'grand', 'daughter', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'series', 'great', 'characters', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'twice', 'already', 'Well', 'price', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'value', 'family', 'anime', 'fans', 'spite', 'somewhat', 'predictible', 'story', 'lines']",Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040: Complete Series Classic

I grew up on toonami and adult swim anime and always heard this was a great cyberpunk anime. It is a pretty good concept and worth a watch, however the animation is a good bit static and kind of lame. The story is ok, some parts are better than others. A lot of modern anime steal ideas from this one, especially Burst Angel.
