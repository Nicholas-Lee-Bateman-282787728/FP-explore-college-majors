1464026,A21ROY5FAOJHNN,B005L0XY5C,L L Blair,"[22, 22]","First of all, I'd like to say that I credit Bethenny Frankel (and Kristin McGee) for helping me lose some weight and get into better shape with the Body by Bethenny DVD that I LOVE. I saw this new DVD while shopping at Target and had to have it, and while the workout is awesome, I just have minor issues that bothered me a little bit.Good things first. Like I said, the workout is great, and about as challenging as Body by Bethenny was. Not overly so but still...it's not easy. The new trainer, Mike, is wonderful. His calm approach and quirky sense of humor eased me through the workout, and I will say that time FLIES on this thing. I like to do at least 35 minutes worth of exercise, so about 2 segments, and yeah, I'm done before I know it. Having the three segments instead of the one long yoga segment in Body by Bethenny is a plus, because you get to chose what you feel like doing each day and it feels like less of an undertaking.Now for the minor issues. There seems to be something wrong with the DVD menu. Whenever I select one of the segments specifically on the DVD, I expect it to play that segment and then return me to the menu page--but that never happens. For example, I only wanted to do the first 15 minute segment one day, and I was just waiting for it to end and return to the menu, but it kept going onto the second segment. I didn't realize I'd been working out for 25 minutes until I looked at the timer. It's not a huge deal, but the fact that it does this doesn't make very much sense. Secondly, my one gripe with the workout is that there is a LOT more balancing stuff than Body by Bethenny. I understand the importance of balance, but as Bethenny says, somedays you can do it and somedays you can't. And when you can't do it and they're holding multiple balancing poses for long periods of time, it gets frustrating and annoying. Body by Bethenny had the tree pose and warrior 3, but that's it, and if I couldn't balance I was only missing out on about 2 minutes of exercise. When I can't balance and I'm missing pose after pose on this DVD, it feels like I'm wasting time.But like I said, these are just minor problems. I can definitely look past them and say I'm happy I bought this DVD, and I will be using it just as much as Body by Bethenny, which is a lot.",4,"great workout, minor issues",1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,2294,"['First', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'credit', 'Bethenny', 'Frankel', 'Kristin', 'McGee', 'helping', 'lose', 'weight', 'get', 'better', 'shape', 'Body', 'Bethenny', 'DVD', 'LOVE', 'saw', 'new', 'DVD', 'shopping', 'Target', 'had', 'have', 'workout', 'awesome', 'just', 'have', 'minor', 'issues', 'bothered', 'little', 'bit.Good', 'things', 'first', 'said', 'workout', 'great', 'as', 'challenging', 'Body', 'Bethenny', 'was', 'Not', 'overly', 'so', 'still', 'not', 'easy', 'new', 'trainer', 'Mike', 'wonderful', 'calm', 'approach', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'eased', 'workout', 'will', 'say', 'time', 'FLIES', 'thing', 'like', 'do', 'least', '35', 'minutes', 'exercise', 'so', '2', 'segments', 'yeah', ""'m"", 'done', 'know', 'Having', 'three', 'segments', 'instead', 'one', 'long', 'yoga', 'segment', 'Body', 'Bethenny', 'plus', 'get', 'chose', 'what', 'feel', 'doing', 'day', 'less', 'undertaking.Now', 'minor', 'issues', 'be', 'something', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'menu', 'Whenever', 'select', 'one', 'segments', 'specifically', 'DVD', 'expect', 'play', 'segment', 'then', 'return', 'menu', 'page', 'never', 'example', 'only', 'wanted', 'do', 'first', '15', 'minute', 'segment', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'end', 'return', 'menu', 'kept', 'going', 'second', 'segment', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'d"", 'been', 'working', '25', 'minutes', 'looked', 'timer', 'not', 'huge', 'deal', 'fact', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'much', 'sense', 'Secondly', 'one', 'gripe', 'workout', 'LOT', 'more', 'balancing', 'stuff', 'Body', 'Bethenny', 'understand', 'importance', 'balance', 'Bethenny', 'can', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""'re"", 'holding', 'multiple', 'balancing', 'poses', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'frustrating', 'annoying', 'Body', 'Bethenny', 'had', 'tree', 'pose', 'warrior', '3', 'could', ""n't"", 'balance', 'was', 'only', 'missing', 'out', '2', 'minutes', 'exercise', 'When', 'ca', ""n't"", 'balance', ""'m"", 'missing', 'pose', 'pose', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'wasting', 'time.But', 'said', 'are', 'just', 'minor', 'problems', 'can', 'definitely', 'look', 'say', ""'m"", 'happy', 'bought', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'using', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Body', 'Bethenny', 'lot']",BETHENNY'S SKINNYGIRL WORKOUT

In other words, when I chose to do just workout 1, it jumped right to workout 2 and the rest of the DVD. Plus, this DVD should be considered advanced since most of the poses are sort of confusing and difficult for someone like me who is not all that flexible at all.  Other than that, I hope Mike McArdle will be out with more yoga DVDs in the near future.  He was not bad at all as instructor.  But Bethenny's chatter often interrupted with his teachings which caused some confusion as too what the moves I was supposed to be doing.",1,This Yoga Workout Does Not Work Out Well For Me!,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,675,"['was', 'not', 'case', 'chatter', 'Bethenny', 'instructor', 'perhaps', 'was', 'was', 'mix', 'match', 'feature', 'here', 'other', 'words', 'when', 'chose', 'do', 'just', 'workout', '1', 'jumped', 'right', 'workout', '2', 'rest', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'advanced', 'most', 'poses', 'are', 'sort', 'confusing', 'difficult', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'flexible', 'Other', 'hope', 'Mike', 'McArdle', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'more', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'near', 'future', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'instructor', 'Bethenny', 'chatter', 'often', 'interrupted', 'teachings', 'caused', 'confusion', 'too', 'what', 'moves', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing']",BETHENNY'S SKINNYGIRL WORKOUT
