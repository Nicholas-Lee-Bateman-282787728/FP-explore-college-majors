1456634,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005ELMC0G,A kids review,"[0, 0]","Disney's return to the Hundred Acre Wood could also, in some sense, be considered a reintroduction of Winnie the Pooh to contemporary audiences. The new film takes its inspiration from three previously told stories written by original author A.A. Milne, one of which has already been made into film. Produced in traditional hand-drawn animation and featuring the talents of Jim Cummings, who has voiced Pooh since the late 1980s, and a cast of other accomplished voice actors, Winnie the Pooh finds the honey-loving bear on a dual mission to retrieve Eeyore's missing tail and to rescue Christopher Robin from a creature the gang has surmised is called a ""Backson."" Winnie the Pooh is an earnest throwback to the Pooh tales of old, filled with sweet nostalgia and gentle whimsy. Though it's aimed primarily at the young ones, those who grew up with Milne's classic tales should also get a little trip down memory lane out of the film, which makes it an enjoyable film for the whole family.",5,Winnie the Pooh,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,989,"['Disney', 'return', 'Hundred', 'Acre', 'Wood', 'could', 'also', 'sense', 'be', 'considered', 'reintroduction', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'new', 'film', 'inspiration', 'three', 'previously', 'told', 'stories', 'written', 'original', 'author', 'A.A.', 'Milne', 'one', 'already', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'Produced', 'traditional', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'featuring', 'talents', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'who', 'voiced', 'Pooh', 'late', '1980s', 'cast', 'other', 'accomplished', 'voice', 'actors', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'honey-loving', 'bear', 'dual', 'mission', 'retrieve', 'Eeyore', 'missing', 'tail', 'rescue', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'creature', 'gang', 'surmised', 'called', 'Backson', 'Pooh', 'earnest', 'throwback', 'Pooh', 'tales', 'old', 'filled', 'sweet', 'nostalgia', 'gentle', 'whimsy', 'aimed', 'primarily', 'young', 'ones', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Milne', 'classic', 'tales', 'should', 'also', 'get', 'little', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'whole', 'family']",N/A

1456637,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005ELMC0G,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I will openly admit that I was enchanted by this film.  It was such a wonderful theatrical experience for me, so nostalgic and heartwarming, and to be able to share it with my daughters was such a joy for me and my wife.  Watching their faces light up as the characters I grew up loving personally caught their eye and entered their hearts was such a wondrous experience and one that I will remember always.It is with such strong sentiment that I write this review.Personally, `Winnie the Pooh's greatest asset is also its sole weakness.  It is pristinely `simple' in texture.  There really isn't any thematic depth at play here and so it instantly captures your attention but it lacks any and all poignancy or profound depth of development to warrant rapturous praise.  That is why I mention the fact that I review this on the grounds of sentiment, because it is that sentiment that will endear this film to you; nothing else.The film brings nothing new to the table, unless you consider its rustic roots `new' in today's modern take on animated features.The film is constructed in such sharp contrast to animated features of today.  It is narrated, it is hand drawn, it is told in storybook form and feels outdated yet surprisingly polished for a film so steeped in the qualities of yesteryear.  The plot is fairly simple and somewhat pointless.  A misunderstanding turns into panic that is easily resolved.  Nothing more; nothing less.  The love here stems from the beautifully fluid way in which the film is conceived.  It is done almost dreamily, capturing the effortless ease with which these characters live their lives and it captures the boyish imagination (simple and honed as opposed to wildly bizarre) and takes you back to a place and time when life wasn't so complicated.  This is a youthful and beautifully charmed children's movie that is as much FOR children as it is ABOUT them.And with vocal talent Zooey Deschanel on board, the musical accompaniment is an added bonus.I thoroughly enjoyed this.  The running time was perfect (not too long, not too short; just right) and the overall satisfaction I received (as well as my family) was as much as I could really hope for.  It is not as smart as a Pixar film, sure.  It will not leave you with the emotional lump that `Up' would, and it won't visually stimulate you as much as `Finding Nemo' will and it won't excite you in the way that `The Incredibles' will, but it will put a gigantic smile on your face, and thankfully this one won't go over your children's heads!",4,"Short, sweet and to the point...",1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,2535,"['will', 'openly', 'admit', 'was', 'enchanted', 'film', 'was', 'such', 'wonderful', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'so', 'nostalgic', 'heartwarming', 'be', 'able', 'share', 'daughters', 'was', 'such', 'joy', 'wife', 'Watching', 'light', 'up', 'characters', 'grew', 'up', 'loving', 'personally', 'caught', 'eye', 'entered', 'hearts', 'was', 'such', 'wondrous', 'experience', 'one', 'will', 'remember', 'always.It', 'such', 'strong', 'sentiment', 'write', 'review.Personally', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'greatest', 'asset', 'also', 'sole', 'weakness', 'pristinely', 'simple', 'texture', 'really', ""n't"", 'thematic', 'depth', 'play', 'here', 'so', 'instantly', 'attention', 'poignancy', 'profound', 'depth', 'development', 'warrant', 'rapturous', 'praise', 'why', 'mention', 'fact', 'review', 'grounds', 'sentiment', 'sentiment', 'will', 'endear', 'film', 'nothing', 'else.The', 'film', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'consider', 'rustic', 'roots', 'new', 'today', 'modern', 'take', 'animated', 'features.The', 'film', 'constructed', 'such', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'animated', 'features', 'today', 'narrated', 'hand', 'drawn', 'told', 'storybook', 'form', 'feels', 'outdated', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'polished', 'film', 'so', 'steeped', 'qualities', 'yesteryear', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'somewhat', 'pointless', 'misunderstanding', 'panic', 'easily', 'resolved', 'Nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'love', 'here', 'beautifully', 'fluid', 'way', 'film', 'conceived', 'done', 'almost', 'dreamily', 'capturing', 'effortless', 'ease', 'characters', 'live', 'lives', 'boyish', 'imagination', 'simple', 'honed', 'opposed', 'wildly', 'bizarre', 'back', 'place', 'time', 'when', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'complicated', 'youthful', 'beautifully', 'charmed', 'children', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'FOR', 'children', 'ABOUT', 'them.And', 'vocal', 'talent', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'board', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'added', 'bonus.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'running', 'time', 'was', 'perfect', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'too', 'short', 'just', 'right', 'overall', 'satisfaction', 'received', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'really', 'hope', 'not', 'as', 'smart', 'Pixar', 'film', 'sure', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'emotional', 'lump', 'would', 'wo', ""n't"", 'visually', 'stimulate', 'as', 'much', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'excite', 'way', 'Incredibles', 'will', 'will', 'put', 'gigantic', 'smile', 'face', 'thankfully', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'children', 'heads']",N/A
1456638,A3F8LMJKR5HAH4,B005ELMC0G,Annie,"[5, 7]","I don't know where to begin with this movie. It has the same plot as ""Pooh's Grand Adventure"" only not nearly as good.  It starts with Owl misreading one of Christopher Robin's notes leading everyone to believe he has been captured by the ""Backson"" (when CR said he would be ""back soon""). well...that has already been done, hasn't it? It is just filled with...filler.  Unmemorable songs, inconsistent characters, (rabbit is a soldier and Tigger wants another Tigger? what happened to him being the only one? and pooh's daydream that everything is honey with seems to be a knock-off of the ""Heffalumps and Woosels"" segment) And there's the side story with Eeyore losing his tail and whoever finds him a replacement wins a pot of honey.  I was also expecting familiar voices for the characters from the movie description.  Pooh's and Tigger's were the only ones that were the same! Eeyore, Rabbit, Piglet, Owl and Christopher Robin all had voices I did not recognize.  And Christopher Robin is taller and much skinnier than he used to be....sort of looking like a lanky teenager.  is he older or is he supposed to be super-skinny now? I was very unimpressed with this movie.  The only redeeming point is how the characters interact with the words in the book like the original movie.Now, I just watched ""pooh's balloon"" on the bonus features.  It is the SAME segment from the original movie of Pooh trying to disguise himself as a little black raincloud.  EXCEPT it is edited to make it a ""short"" and dubbed over with the new voices.  Crap.

1456639,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B005ELMC0G,Armando N. Roman,"[7, 11]","While I wasn't a huge fan of Winnie the Pooh when I was younger, I did enjoy the animated series that ran from 1988 to 1991, and of course I have fond memories of the old films. The gang getting lost in the woods, Poohsticks, the mystery surrounding Heffalumps and Woozles, Piglet being treated as a king in the Land of Milk and Honey...I can still remember it all 20+ years later. I felt really bad for this new movie when it came out and bombed in theaters. Here Disney was going back to a beloved franchise, sticking with traditional animation and keeping things simple, as they should be...but something seemed off. When I saw the trailer, I could just tell that all the best parts were shown in it, including the ending, and I wasn't too thrilled about the drastic change in a few voices (Owl and Christopher Robin in particular). Still, I gave it a chance, and the movie ended up being alright. It's just barely over an hour, has no objectionable content, and features most of the characters that everyone loves. But my problem is that they played it so safe that there's nothing that makes this feel like it deserved the theatrical treatment. If anything, this is an extended episode of the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.Once again, Eeyore has lost his tail, and it's up to Pooh and the other residents of the Hundred Acre Wood to find it. But in the process of finding it, another problem pops up- thanks to Owl's poor reading abilities, he reads a note from Christopher Robin (that reads 'Gon Out Bizy Back Soon') and thinks that a creature known as a Backson has taken him hostage. This leads to everyone trying to figure out how to deal with the monster and get CR back. Tigger thinks he needs a sidekick, and recruits Eeyore against his will, dressing him up as another Tigger. Pooh and Piglet dig a pit and cover it with a picnic blanket with a trail of things that Backsons like leading right to it. And of course, while this is all happening, Pooh is desperately trying to get his honey fix, having delusions of the world being covered in honey and other crazy things.Since the movie is a little over an hour, it moves at a fast pace, with the story never really dragging on. But it's just so plain that it was hard for me to get into like the older Pooh films and episodes. I've went back recently and watched a lot of those to see if they hold up, and sure enough, they do. To me, this movie felt like an attempt to just win over people with a 'old school hand drawn animation equals good, right?!' mentality. I was really hoping that the story that was rumored a few years ago, about Christopher Robin growing up and not needing his stuffed animal friends any more, was going to be used here, but maybe that was too emotional for a Pooh movie? What's here works though, with a lot of fun plays on words (literally and figuratively- the storybook layout is used quite a bit), some memorable facial expressions from Rabbit, beautiful animation and art direction, and a lot of time spent with most of the characters. Tigger isn't featured very much, and Gopher isn't in the movie at all, but all the other regulars are here in full force. The movie definitely isn't bad, but it's not memorable either. I just watched it about 6 hours ago with my daughter, and I can remember more about the episode of Dexter's Laboratory we saw yesterday before dinner...and that was 1/3 the runtime of this movie.Overall the movie looks great and the clarity on the blu-ray is stunning. You can see every detail perfectly here, from the scratchy look of Pooh's eyebrows when he thinks, to the black lines on Rabbit's fur getting riled up when something bad happens. Since the animation style for this movie is a slightly updated take on the way it was animated in previous Pooh movies, it's sure to visually please everyone. The audio gets good treatment as well, with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix. Winnie the Pooh sure doesn't need a booming track like this since it's mostly dialogue-driven with a couple of songs here and there, but it certainly gets the job done.The special features are lacking compared to most other Disney releases this year, but it's still better than say, The Fox and the Hound's. There are 5 deleted scenes with introductions for why they were cut (ironically, it was usually for pacing), and some of them are complete while others are in sketches and storyboards. There's also what's pretty much a commercial for Disney goods that shows how you can set up your baby's nursery to have a Pooh theme. Yeah, you'll be skipping this one. There are also a sing-along feature and an option to jump to the songs in the movie. The only good special features here are the mini documentary that covers Pooh's journey from the original books to the short films by Disney, and the two bonus shorts 'The Ballad of Nessie' and 'Pooh's Balloon'. The documentary is great for Disney fans and the shorts are just plain nice to have. But apart from those, there's not much else to check out here.It's certainly better than Cars 2, but for me Winnie the Pooh doesn't even come close to the likes of Rango or Kung Fu Panda 2. Those were both incredible movies in their own right, animated or not, and had plots and characters I cared for. This...is just a longer episode of Winnie the Pooh, using its good ol' Pooh formula. If this were a tv movie to kick off a new Pooh animated series on tv, that'd be cool, but this was a theatrical release. I can't stress it enough- this movie isn't bad, but it could've used a lot more effort instead of just going by the book. Rent it before buying unless you're a huge Pooh fan.",3,Oh bother...,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,5630,"['was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'did', 'enjoy',

It's all stuff that I wouldn't mind at all in another movie, but in this context it constitutes a failure to recapture the spirit of the original stories. In fact, it makes it seem like they weren't even trying that hard. The movie falls victim to the modern ""edginess"" which I think is the opposite of the charm and innocence that made the original Pooh stories so special.I think the example that stuck with me the most is the scene where Pooh is stuck in a hole, and the others are arguing over who should investigate whether he was the monster they were trying to catch.

1456657,A11C43I615R52G,B005ELMC0G,"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker""","[50, 58]","I have to say that Winnie the Pooh haven't been much appealing to me like other Disney films and characters have. Mostly relegated to direct-to video market, Pooh is somewhat kiddie fare without much transcendance. Still, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977) remains an endearing classic with excellent stories and appealing characters. The Many Adventures approaches Pooh in a very low-key manner but this is an excellent way to envision Pooh, a low key affair that nontheless provides good quality entertainment for everyone and that's why this film succeds where all the other Pooh films have failed.When I heard that Winnie the Pooh was returning to theaters this year, I approached the news cautiously, as I said before, Pooh is not my cup of tea and aside from The Many Adventures is just not appealing to grown ups. Here in Latin America the now simply titled ""Winnie the Pooh"" premiered on May 6 (it opened in the States on July 15). I have to report that Disney Animation Studios did an excellent job with this film. Instead of a compillation of short films like its predecessor, this one takes some A. A. Milne original stories and mesh them in one single long film (although long is not the appropiate word because the film runs barely 70 minutes). Although it's not a compillation of shorts, the film feels a little episodic with Pooh & Co. stumbilng into one problem after another. I won't give away any spoliers but let me tell you that this film not only feels true to its original source, it also feels true to the original film. The same low key approach is seen here so don't expect a grand spectacle like last year's Tangled. The animation is remiscent of the original film with of course a newer quality on it. The characters are endearing and not obnoxious (except for the Owl but only in some scenes) and the Hundred Acre Wood retains that magic quality of the first film. Also the characters address the audience and the voice cast is remarkable. Kids will surely enjoy it and grown ups will also smile looking at this level of innocence and simplicity that will remind them what was to be a kid. The new songs are not memorable but serves the film right.Video & AudioWinnie the Pooh looks absolutely spectacular in HD. Detail, colors and contrast are exquisite in every scene, in every character. This is another top-notch transfer from Disney.The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also excellent. This is not a bombastic film but sound is great with no signs of compression and good directionality.Bonus MaterialWinnie the Pooh does not come as packed as other Disney titles but has some good bonus material including:""Winnie the Pooh and his Story too"" is a kind of making of featurette of the film that is too short but still informative.""Deleted Scenes"": You have five deleted scenes each one with an introduction from the director.Bonus Shorts: This BD comes with two shorts. The first one is ""The Ballad of Nessie"" that accompanied Winnie the Pooh in theaters, the other is Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: Pooh's Balloon that features Pooh, Christopher Robin and a blue balloon.You also have a sing along option, Disney's song selection and a featurette of how to create a Pooh nursery.A DVD and a Digital Copy are also included.Closing ThoughtsWinnie the Pooh is a great film that breathes new life to the old bear. It has a lot going for it and I really recommend you give Pooh a chance especially if you have kids, you won't regret it. The BD features an amazing presentation of the film with stellar picture and sound and a healthy collection of bonus material.

The original The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh was actually three shorts sewn together for a theatrical release, so this is the first time that Pooh gets a true theatrical released movie. The film is rather short at 63 minutes and while entertaining(more for small children) I didn't see the point of this being a theatrically released film considering the string of great films that immediately proceeded it.The Blu Ray looks fabulous though and while a lot of the original voice actors are gone now, they did find some amazingly close sounding voice talent for some of the key characters. The animation looks like a perfcet continuation from the first film and I love the addition of Zooey Dechannel's music. It's a cute movie that is probably more well received by children, but being a collector of all Disney theatrical films I could have done without this one. The 3 disc Blu Ray is short one with a 63 minute film, 2 shorts and some bonus material that won't take long before all is exhausted. I also find that since there are so many complaints in these times about bad role models for kids in animated films(Vanelope from Wreck It Ralph etc.), it seems laughable that no one seems to mind a lazy, begging bear who will connive his way to a free lunch of honey any chance he can get!

1456659,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B005ELMC0G,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 7]","Like many other people, I have fond nostalgic memories of watching the original ""Winnie the Pooh"" shorts when I was a little kid. However, the Disney Corporation then spent many years systematically RAPING my childhood by putting out increasingly awful Pooh adventures, whitewashing all the characters, adding a bunch of NEW ones nobody liked, and even erasing Christopher Robin. SACRILEGE!Fortunately, the 2011 ""Winnie the Pooh"" movie is a much more satisfying experience, especially since the story hearkens back to the original A.A. Milne stories. It has the slight tweeness that comes from TRYING to match the original's charm, and the musical numbers are pretty disposable, but it recaptures much of the atmosphere and childish chaos.While on the hunt for honey, Pooh finds that Eeyore has lost his tail, leading to a contest among the Hundred-Acre Woods' inhabitants. The tail remains missing, and none of the substitutes really work. The next day, Pooh also finds that Christopher Robin has gone mysteriously missing, leaving behind a note: ""Gon Out Bizzy Back Soon.""Since Owl doesn't read nearly as well as he thinks he does, he interprets the note to mean that Christopher Robin has been abducted by a monster known as the Backson. So Rabbit organizes an elaborate trap to catch the Backson, Tigger begins teaching poor Eeyore how to be a second Tigger, and Pooh continues his quest for HONEY. Chaos ensues.Anyone expecting something as effortlessly charming and nostalgic as the 1960s/1970s Pooh adventures is going to be disappointed. ""Winnie the Pooh"" is consciously trying to capture that charm, so it sometimes gets twee. Also, the musical numbers are pretty much 100% padding, and are thoroughly mediocre.However, the movie does feel like an earnest, genuine attempt to return to everything we loved about Pooh -- the omniscient narrator, the opening sequence, the movable letters, and the feeling of childish chaos (the ""trap"" for the Backson is a bunch of random objects leading to a pit).

1456664,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B005ELMC0G,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[11, 12]","It wasn't loaded with special effects, blaring music, big splashy stars or explosions. Summer 2011's Disney theatrical release, ""Winnie the Pooh,"" was exactly the kind of animated film Walt Disney was making in the late '50s/early '60s -- not sweeping epics, nor pop music short packages, but simple, glowing stories packed with rich characterizations (both in writing and animation), superb voice work and hummable tunes.Some found this film to be too much of a throwback, but how many modern films can truly rekindle the texture and charm of a classic without succumbing to the present day trappings and trends? Like the TV series ""Seinfeld"" was in its deceptively self effacing claim to be ""about nothing,"" Pooh's power lies shines his basic plotlines, only without the cynicism. A.A. Milne's books had slim storylines, too, and attempts to clutter them have met with mixed results.First and foremost, ""Winnie the Pooh"" is one of the funniest movies of the year. I don't say this with any hint of irony or sarcasm, it's just true. Without messing around with the characters or updating the humor, you find yourself laughing at the clever ""who's on first"" wordplay. Pooh and pals may be guileless, a bit deluded and sometimes clueless, but they're not stupid or held to ridicule. This is very, very hard humor to pull off successfully.The most clueless character of all is Owl, a character never fully realized in past ""Poohs"" but brought to scene-stealing fervor by the sharp vocal timing of Craig Ferguson, who with narrator John Cleese and Zooey Deschanel, are as far as the voice casting ventured into celebrity (but with respect to suitability, not just fame). Cheers to the creative team for retaining the seemingly endless talents of Jim Cummings as Pooh and Piglet rather than hiring a marquee name and wrecking the character for an easy marketing hook. Tom Kenny also does a wonderfully neurotic Rabbit, and my kids got a kick out of hearing wisps of his Spongebob voice peeking out within the characterization.The musical score by Robert Rodriguez and Kristen Anderson-Rodriguez (she also voices Kanga) is a tribute to the Sherman Brothers' art of the deceptively simple and infinitely singable song. I can't help but assume that the chorus singing ""hunny, hunny..."" was a nod to the Wonderful World of Color theme (""color,  color..."").The Blu-ray looks marvelous, but I was a little let down by the lack of extras. No commentary, not much behind the scenes stuff, pretty lacking all around. Most interesting were the deleted scenes. Charming as they were, the scenes were cut because, it seems from the explanation, to keep the story focused and evenhanded. Although Owl is a scene stealer, he's never the complete focus. Each character gets a sufficient time to shine, even ""B'loon."" The filmmakers even resisted padding the feature to make it longer, instead adding on The Ballad of Nessie (another film that could have been released in the early Disney/Pooh days). Historically, ""Dumbo"" was a short feature too, but it's a gem at its ideal running time.I can only hope they're saving some additional features for a reissue in the future, because this Pooh should not get lost in a sea of direct-to-video movies. Not to slight them all (many were very nice), but it's pretty crowded out there with Pooh videos.

1456672,A1EARN5PUVIF1S,B005ELMC0G,Jerry P. Danzig,"[5, 7]","As a lifelong lover of both the original A.A. Milne Pooh stories and the original fully animated Disney Pooh short subjects, I am sorry to report that I found this latest effort falling far short of the mark both literally and figuratively.The writers and directors here have tried so hard to create a light and airy trifle that they have succeeded only in producing something quite dull and leaden.  Striving hard for whimsy, they have lost the wit and wisdom that also informed the Pooh stories.I think this effort made me laugh once in the course of what wound up being a very long hour.Many things are wrong here.Milne's Pooh, though a bear of ""very little brain,"" had more than his share of heart and common sense.  He would often save the day in his thoughtful, methodical way while the more self-absorbed Owl, Tigger, and Rabbit would fail in their wild schemes.Above all, Pooh was a philosopher, motivated by much more than the grumblings of his stomach (which in this movie sound like Tigger growling, a disconcerting effect).  He was most of all loving and caring, seeking to help his friends with their dilemmas rather than just helping himself to honey.This sense of selflessness is all but lost in this film, which starts on an off-note by focusing on Christopher Robin's penchant for collecting things, stuffed animals key among them (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, Disney Store shoppers!)Though a line at the end of the credits notes that ""No stuffed animals were harmed in the making of this film,"" indeed these immortal characters have all been done a disservice, being reduced here to rather silly and vapid one-dimensional icons.The listless plot, a concatenation of Milne stories, meanders off the path of logic as well, notably when the critters fall into a pit they have dug for the fearsome beast they believe may have kidnapped Christopher Robin -- and Owl flies out, as birds will, only to return to the pit without explanation and wait to be rescued with the others.The traditional hand-drawn animation is rather plain and flat, and a number of the new voices fall flat as well, notably those of Tigger, Owl, Rabbit, and Kanga.So parents wishing to share their love of Pooh with their young progeny would do better to read the Milne stories to their children -- or buy the DVDs of the ""classic"" Pooh short subjects from the sixties and seventies.And if anyone at Disney still cares for the Pooh property as anything more than a profit center, they would be well advised to replace the creative team responsible for this lead-footed affair with some who are far more inspired.

I am a huge Disney fan and I love Winnie the Pooh, so of course I was excited when this film came out in theaters. What really turned me off was the fact that it was released the same day as ""Harry Potter & the Deathly Hollows (Part 2)."" Of course, I wanted to see both films, however, I wish Pooh was released a few days before Potter. It probably would have been recognized a bit more. Disney should have known Harry Potter was gonna outdo every other film at the box office. But, that doesn't matter now. I thought the animation was stunning, and Zooey Deschanel has the most beautiful singing voice. The DVD is pretty good. Glad Jim Cummings was back to voice both Pooh and Tigger. Bud Luckey (an animator at Pixar) voices Eeyore, and Tom Kenney (the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants) voices Rabbit. John Cleese (of Monty Python) was a perfect choice as the narrator because he sounds similar to Laurie Main (who was the narrator for ""Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore""). Despite that the film was short, it was the best film of 2011 that I've seen. Yes, I liked it better than Harry Potter (and HP fanboys/fangirls, yell at me all you want)!The DVD has some good bonus features like ""The Ballad of Nessie"" (a short film that proceeded ""Winnie the Pooh"" in theaters), a couple ""Mini-Adventures"" shorts where they basically dub over previous Pooh projects and shorten them, which I'm not really a fan of.Now, all we need is a Blu-Ray release of ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.""",5,A Must for any Pooh Fan,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,1544,"['how', 'animated', 'film', 'suppose', 'look', 'am', 'huge', 'Disney', 'fan', 'love', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'course', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'What', 'really', 'turned', 'off', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'day', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hollows', 'Part', '2', 'course', 'wanted', 'see', 'films', 'however', 'wish', 'Pooh', 'was', 'released', 'few', 'days', 'Potter', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'recognized', 'bit', 'more', 'Disney', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'was', 'gon', 'outdo', 'other', 'film', 'box', 'office', ""n't"", 'matter', 'now', 'thought', 'animation', 'was', 'stunning', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'most', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'voice', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'Glad', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'was', 'back', 'voice', 'Pooh', 'Tigger', 'Bud', 'Luckey', 'animator', 'Pixar', 'voices', 'Eeyore', 'Tom', 'Kenney', 'voice', 'SpongeBob', 'SquarePants', 'Rabbit', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Monty', 'Python', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'narrator', 'similar', 'Laurie', 'Main', 'who', 'was', 'narrator', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Day', 'Eeyore', 'film', 'was', 'short', 'was', 'best', 'film', '2011', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Yes', 'liked', 'better', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'HP', 'fanboys/fangirls', 'yell', 'want', 'DVD', 'good', 'bonus', 'features', 'Ballad', 'Nessie', 'short', 'film', 'proceeded', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'theaters', 'couple', 'Mini-Adventures', 'shorts', 'where', 'basically', 'dub', 'over', 'previous', 'Pooh', 'projects', 'shorten', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'of.Now', 'need', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh']",N/A
1456674,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005ELMC0G,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[31, 46]","Winnie the Pooh is an animated film made specifically for children, with none of the innuendo or adult humor commonly incorporated into animated films to keep parents entertained. Effectively, the material isn't dumbed-down to completely alienate anyone under the age of four like the recentYogi Bear. For children, Winnie the Pooh is, in some respects, the perfect movie. It has familiar characters, a simple story, beautiful, soft colors, and parents will likely hear no complaints from their children about it. However, children aren't the ones reading reviews. For the average adult, Winnie the Pooh is certainly not ""bad,"" but there are some inconsistencies and imperfections that can't be overlooked.The film draws inspiration from three stories by Winnie the Pooh creator A.A. Milne and is narrated by John Cleese while following a storybook format in which the stories appear as if being read from a book. The gang is looking for the perpetually depressed Eeyore's missing tail, although Pooh is mostly preoccupied with his quest for honey. Meanwhile, they're trying to avoid confrontation with the ""Bacson,"" a monster whom they believe has kidnapped Christopher Robin. The film has a couple musical numbers, but nothing bombastic. The most memorable music comes from actress Zooey Deschanel, whose old-timey crooning underscores several scenes and adds to the classic, throwback feel of the whole thing.Winnie the Pooh, in book, movie, and television form was a staple of my childhood but one with which my familiarity has waned since. There are elements of these stories that I look at differently now and things I was unaware of as a child. In some ways, the enjoyment I took from this film spawned from the nostalgic trip through childhood it provides. Seeing Owl (voiced by an unrecognizable Craig Ferguson) as an egotistical, pseudo-intellectual and Eeyore as clinically depressed and in desperate need of counseling adds a different perspective to the whole thing now that I'm older. It's worth noting that Eeyore is the scene-stealer here, with some great voice-work by Bud Luckey and some very emotive expressions in the animation.It's nice to see Disney return to their roots with varying levels of success and not making any attempt to modernize Winnie the Pooh, which is how it should be. There is nothing that is downright bad, nothing that should've been scrapped from the film and replaced. The good completely outweighs the bad. The film is undeniably charming and adorable. It's refreshingly hand-drawn and looks beautiful, with CGI that is hardly noticeable mixed in for effect. Children will be delighted by it, while adults will enjoy the nostalgic trip down memory lane and the good message about helping others. The film is definitely a children's film through-and-through, but it's not so offensively childish that it will turn away an adult audience.The biggest problem is that it isn't quite up to theatrical film standards and is like high-quality straight-to-video fare. Running a mere 51-minutes, not counting credits and an amusing post-credits scene, it's underdeveloped and half an hour shy of ""feature-length."" With plenty of stories to draw from, it's inconceivable that the running time couldn't have been stretched to at least 80 minutes. Winnie the Pooh will be most enjoyed by children but won't waste your time if you decide to watch it with them. It could have been a fantastic success, critically and financially for Disney, as it features one of their most beloved characters and is a 2D, mostly hand-drawn film in a time of excessive 3D and almost exclusive CGI. With a strong critical reception and box-office records that indicate it broke even with its budget, it's probably not a failure in their eyes nor a great success. I see it the same way.GRADE: C+",3,"Neither a Great Success, Nor a Great Failure",1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,3808,"['Pooh', 'animated', 'film', 'made', 'specifically', 'children', 'none', 'innuendo', 'adult', 'humor', 'commonly', 'incorporated', 'animated', 'films', 'keep', 'parents', 'entertained', 'Effectively', 'material', ""n't"", 'dumbed-down', 'completely', 'alienate', 'anyone', 'age', 'four', 'recentYogi', 'Bear', 'children', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'respects', 'perfect', 'movie', 'familiar', 'characters', 'simple', 'story', 'beautiful', 'soft', 'colors', 'parents', 'will', 'likely', 'hear', 'complaints', 'children', 'However', 'children', 'are', ""n't"", 'ones', 'reading', 'reviews', 'average', 'adult', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'imperfections', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'overlooked.The', 'film', 'draws', 'inspiration', 'three', 'stories', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'creator', 'A.A.', 'Milne', 'narrated', 'John', 'Cleese', 'following', 'storybook', 'format', 'stories', 'appear', 'being', 'read', 'book', 'gang', 'looking', 'perpetually', 'depressed', 'Eeyore', 'missing', 'tail', 'Pooh', 'mostly', 'preoccupied', 'quest', 'honey', 'Meanwhile', ""'re"", 'trying', 'avoid', 'confrontation', 'Bacson', 'monster', 'whom', 'believe', 'kidnapped', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'film', 'couple', 'musical', 'numbers', 'nothing', 'bombastic', 'most', 'memorable', 'music', 'actress', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'old-timey', 'crooning', 'underscores', 'several', 'scenes', 'classic', 'throwback', 'feel', 'whole', 'thing.Winnie', 'Pooh', 'book', 'movie', 'television', 'form', 'was', 'staple', 'childhood', 'one', 'familiarity', 'waned', 'are', 'elements', 'stories', 'look', 'differently', 'now', 'things', 'was', 'unaware', 'child', 'ways', 'enjoyment', 'took', 'film', 'spawned', 'nostalgic', 'trip', 'childhood', 'Seeing', 'Owl', 'voiced', 'unrecognizable', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', 'egotistical', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'Eeyore', 'clinically', 'depressed', 'desperate', 'need', 'counseling', 'different', 'perspective', 'whole', 'thing', 'now', ""'m"", 'older', 'worth', 'noting', 'Eeyore', 'scene-stealer', 'here', 'great', 'voice-work', 'Bud', 'Luckey', 'very', 'emotive', 'expressions', 'animation.It', 'nice', 'see', 'Disney', 'return', 'roots', 'varying', 'levels', 'success', 'not', 'making', 'attempt', 'modernize', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'nothing', 'downright', 'bad', 'nothing', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'scrapped', 'film', 'replaced', 'good', 'completely', 'bad', 'film', 'undeniably', 'charming', 'adorable', 'refreshingly', 'hand-drawn', 'beautiful', 'CGI', 'hardly', 'noticeable', 'mixed', 'effect', 'Children', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'nostalgic', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'good', 'message', 'helping', 'others', 'film', 'definitely', 'children', 'film', 'through-and-through', 'not', 'so', 'offensively', 'childish', 'will', 'turn', 'away', 'adult', 'audience.The', 'biggest', 'problem', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'theatrical', 'film', 'standards', 'like', 'high-quality', 'straight-to-video', 'fare', 'Running', 'mere', '51-minutes', 'not', 'counting', 'credits', 'amusing', 'post-credits', 'scene', 'underdeveloped', 'hour', 'shy', 'feature-length', 'plenty', 'stories', 'draw', 'inconceivable', 'running', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'stretched', 'least', '80', 'minutes', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'decide', 'watch', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'success', 'critically', 'financially', 'Disney', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'characters', '2D', 'mostly', 'hand-drawn', 'film', 'time', 'excessive', '3D', 'almost', 'exclusive', 'CGI', 'strong', 'critical', 'reception', 'box-office', 'records', 'indicate', 'broke', 'even', 'budget', 'probably', 'not', 'failure', 'eyes', 'great', 'success', 'see', 'same', 'way.GRADE', 'C+']",N/A

Yes, there are ""purists"", like myself, who grew up watching Uncle Wally's original series with love and adoration.  I, as others, have been highly disappointed by Disney's output of Pooh stories in recent memory, including the awful Heffalump movie (had very little to do with the book).I feel that Disney did great work with this installment.It is a simple story (or two) about the need for the gang to find Eyeore's tail, but also the need to capture the ""Baksun"" - which is nothing more than the reworking of the Heffalump story.  I will not spoil the story.I first watched this movie in the theatre with my youngest, and we were both laughing out loud.  Not only did the narrative have funny lines, but the script was written for children AND parents.  John Cleese does a great ""Narrator"" job.  Although many (if not all) of the original voices are from now long-deceased talents, the voices here were quite good.  The use of the book pages and the letters upon them made me feel somewhat nostalgic.  The story did not insult my intelligence, either.  I was bothered by the fact that Mr Gopher was not involved, but that is a small problem.The chalkboard animation in the ""Baksun"" discussion is reminiscent of many early Disney works, including ""Donald (Duck) in Mathmagic Land"", and the musical ""Honey"" dream is also done well.  My family greatly enjoyed the scene in the ""hole"".  I am sure that there are other stories from other Pooh tales in the film, but I didn't obsess on that.  I also liked the backgrounds in the ending credits (you'll have to see the backgrounds to understand what I mean).I must note that I bought the DVD so my family could watch the movie, which was only seen by my son and I the first time around.I believe that Disney has redeemed themselves - as far as the Pooh story goes - especially after the much lesser ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"" (2005), a movie I found insulting and poor.Strong 5 of 5!

The whole thing seems as if it were written by 5 different people at different times and they decided to cram it all into one small movie.  A lot of disorganiztion makes the movie bothersome to watch.  Not only that, but it is extremely short! I knew not to expect a 3 hour ordeal but come on?  Barely passing the hour long mark?!  When you add the spastic storyline the movie seems to breeze by in half that time.The characters have all changed.  Their personalities are completely different.  Owl is now a complete know-it-all smart mouth who you just want to punch the entire time.  Pooh is very dark.  Sure, he seems friendly at first, but somewhere he lost his love for others.  He only cares about himself and his needs now and will do anything to satisfy them, such as disregarding Piglet's safety and shoving him head first into a bee hive and then beating it up.  You can clearly tell their is a lack of compassion to Pooh now.  Rabbit is odd, Piglet is different, its just not the same.  Something went wrong.  Eeyore is the only one close to his original self.  Oh, and where was Gopher at?!No heffalumps or woozles?!  That is classic Pooh but they are never mentioned.  That alone was enough to ruin it for me.  Instead you get this Backson crap.  Owl makes up some monster called a Backson and scares everyone into thinking it got Christopher Robin.  Not only that, but the scene in which Owl is ""describing"" this beast is particularly creepy to me.  Not scary, but something that a demented 14 year old would draw in the psych ward.  So you have this weak attempt at an antagonist rather than the outside characters that made the old movies great.Lots of scenes where Pooh is walking on a white blank screen ontop of black text.  Good for enhancing the effect *or to save money ::cough cough::*At first, I said to myself ""its because you are older"".  I figured being 21 Pooh had lost its appeal.  But I started noticing the kids.  All of them crying, kicking, playing with toys, etc.  Clearly bored with the movie.  Some little boy stood up at the end and said ""Thats it?!""  Bare in mind this kid couldn't be more than 7.  So that tells me the audience this was aimed at did not like it themselves.Had this been a straight to DVD release I would have understood.  But they played this up like it was Pooh's triumphant return to the big screen.  All this was was an attempt to put out a summer movie that every parent and babysitter would take the kids to see.  2 and 3 year olds, yeah they will probably like it but I'm going to guess 4 and up won't be too excited about it.  I have to say pass this one up.",2,Terrible,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,3305,"['fiancee', 'are', '21', 'years', 'old', 'grew', 'up', 'Pooh', 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'Blustery', 'Day', 'tape', 'gave', 'out', 'admit', 'even', 'now', 'still', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'old', 'cartoons', 'sake', 'nostalgia', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'one', 'Wishing', 'Well', 'western', 'one', 'were', 'everyone', 'fear', 'getting', 'trounced', 'When', 'new', 'Pooh', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'theater', 'release', 'just', 'knew', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'not.First', 'structure', 'Sure', 'Pooh', 'out', 'honey', 'always', 'movie', 'so', 'easily', 'sidetracked', 'sub', 'plots', 'straying', 'sub', 'plots', 'then', 'bringing', 'back', 'picture', 'worst', 'times', 'whole', 'thing', 'were', 'written', '5', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'times', 'decided', 'cram', 'one', 'small', 'movie', 'lot', 'disorganiztion', 'movie', 'bothersome', 'watch', 'Not', 'only', 'extremely', 'short', 'knew', 'not', 'expect', '3', 'hour', 'ordeal', 'come', 'Barely', 'passing', 'hour', 'long', 'mark', 'When', 'add', 'spastic', 'storyline', 'movie', 'breeze', 'half', 'time.The', 'characters', 'have', 'changed', 'personalities', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'Owl', 'now', 'complete', 'know-it-all', 'smart', 'mouth', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'punch', 'entire', 'time', 'Pooh', 'very', 'dark', 'Sure', 'friendly', 'first', 'somewhere', 'lost', 'love', 'others', 'only', 'needs', 'now', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'satisfy', 'such', 'disregarding', 'Piglet', 'safety', 'shoving', 'head', 'first', 'bee', 'hive', 'then', 'beating', 'up', 'can', 'clearly', 'tell', 'lack', 'compassion', 'Pooh', 'now', 'Rabbit', 'odd', 'Piglet', 'different', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'Something', 'went', 'wrong', 'Eeyore', 'only', 'one', 'close', 'original', 'self', 'Oh', 'where', 'was', 'Gopher', 'heffalumps', 'woozles', 'classic', 'Pooh', 'are', 'never', 'mentioned', 'alone', 'was', 'enough', 'ruin', 'Instead', 'get', 'Backson', 'crap', 'Owl', 'up', 'monster', 'called', 'Backson', 'everyone', 'thinking', 'got', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'Not', 'only', 'scene', 'Owl', 'describing', 'beast', 'particularly', 'creepy', 'Not', 'scary', 'something', 'demented', '14', 'year', 'old', 'would', 'draw', 'psych', 'ward', 'have', 'weak', 'attempt', 'antagonist', 'rather', 'outside', 'characters', 'made', 'old', 'movies', 'great.Lots', 'scenes', 'where', 'Pooh', 'walking', 'white', 'blank', 'screen', 'ontop', 'black', 'text', 'Good', 'enhancing', 'effect', '*or', 'save', 'money', ':cough', 'cough', ':*At', 'first', 'said', 'myself', 'are', 'older', 'figured', 'being', '21', 'Pooh', 'had', 'lost', 'appeal', 'started', 'noticing', 'kids', 'crying', 'kicking', 'playing', 'toys', 'etc', 'Clearly', 'bored', 'movie', 'little', 'boy', 'stood', 'up', 'end', 'said', 'Thats', 'Bare', 'mind', 'kid', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', '7', 'audience', 'was', 'aimed', 'did', 'not', 'been', 'straight', 'DVD', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'understood', 'played', 'was', 'Pooh', 'triumphant', 'return', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'was', 'attempt', 'put', 'out', 'summer', 'movie', 'parent', 'babysitter', 'would', 'take', 'kids', 'see', '2', '3', 'year', 'olds', 'yeah', 'will', 'probably', ""'m"", 'going', 'guess', '4', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'excited', 'have', 'say', 'pass', 'one', 'up']",N/A

Learning that the animation was hand drawn and that many of the songs were co-written by Robert Lopez (co-writer of the musicalsAvenue QandThe Book Of Mormon]) increased my anticipation and I was able to use Mr. Lopez's participation to sell my teenage daughter on seeing the movie.While I can't say the movie lived up toThe Many Adventures Of Winnie The Poohas it exists in my memory, it certainly didn't disappoint. Both daughter and I enjoyed the film. Quite a bit, actually. Mr. Lopez as the ""voice"" of Pooh's tummy was a nice bonus; especially the duet between Pooh and his tummy.There were times when I didn't think the new Pooh quite got the magical tone of the classic Pooh of my childhood, but it never strayed far. And, really, what can live up to idealized childhood memories?.

1456686,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B005ELMC0G,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","Winnie the Pooh and friends return to the big screen in Disney's 2011, hand-drawn animated feature, Winnie the Pooh. In the film, Winnie the Pooh's attempts to get some honey and a group effort to find a new tail for Eeyore, who has lost his own, are disrupted by a mission to capture a scary creature called the Backson, who the gang believes has taken Christopher Robin prisoner.Charming, relaxing, extremely visually appealing and very refreshing to the animation fan these days, not to mention being very funny, ""Winnie the Pooh"" is a delightful and much appreciated treat from Walt Disney studios in an age of far too much, far too similar computer animation. The movie plays out as a clear continuation of 1977's ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"", and pretty much bumps ""Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin"" (which had some similar plot points) as well as some episodes of the animated TV series ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" out of the realm of continuity, but when all is said and done, this is the only post ""Many Adventures"" Pooh work that is on par with the first film (granted, all that other stuff is still mostly great). What I mean is, this is no ""Piglet's Big Movie"" or ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"". Maybe I should think about ""The Tigger Movie"" for a moment though. That one was REALLY good, and it also plays out more like a solid, and reasonably lengthy feature. Still, ""Winnie the Pooh"" is much more similar to the classic, original film in every way, and if that's important to you, well, there ya go. This Pooh film IS short though. That is one of its FEW negatives. The film is barely over an hour, making it practically a featurette. Luckily, when it was released in theaters, it was accompanied by an all-new animated short which the Blu-Ray also includes.In addition to the many compliment I've given the film already, I also want to say that I adore the use of singer/actress Zooey Deschanel here! Even as a guy who usually prefers Minnie Mouse-voiced girls, Zooey's singing is angelic when she sings the RIGHT songs for her. I don't usually feel she does. I mean, anything with a real beat just doesn't seem to go with her voice well. I like her much better with the simpler, slower, more soulful stuff, like ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" in ""Elf"" (which just makes me melt), or, in this case, her perfect rendition of the Winnie the Pooh theme song! I LOVE that! She also sings another song in the film well, though it is brief, but she is unfortunately brought back in the end credits for one of those songs I just don't feel suits her. Still, she was brilliantly selected for the other two!If I was to try to come up with anything else that bothered me in the film, I can only say that Craig Ferguson as ""Owl"" took some getting used to. I mean, he did an admirable job, it just was a very different sounding Owl than I am used to, and even a very different acting Owl. Owl is usually a bit more stuffy and haughty in my mind. Not extremely, but a bit, and not so energetic and even youthful sounding (yeah, Ferguson sounds pretty youthful as Owl, or at least higher pitched). I seem to be used to it now though, as it didn't bother me as much when watching it recently as the first time I saw it. Speaking of, the date I was with that day actually only complained about Christopher Robin. She felt he sounded too young, but then, she was a lot younger than me and may have only been familiar with the animated TV series version of Christopher Robin, who not only sounded older but was also American. Incidentally, despite being around 36 when I saw this, that was my first date, so this is a special film for me. Though, it's also a bit painful, because I was just recently ""let go"" by that girl for someone who is basically just like me but was better at playing it ""aloof"" (I wear my heart on my sleeve) but I digress. Two years! And just a few closed mouth kisses! Sorry... I actually was really in love with her. I know it usually doesn't work out with the first girl, but the first girl is usually not the girl of your dreams, either.Where was I?! (I never said I was mature) Ah, the Blu-Ray. Well, naturally, the film looks and sound PERFECT. And, being that it is a NEW film, Disney actually gives us some nice bonus features here! For one, there's the aforementioned animated short, which was actually about the Loch Ness Monster! It's called ""The Ballad of Nessie"", and though I wasn't too impressed with it the first time I saw it (storywise, I did love it visually; a very retro look), upon recently rewatching it, I really enjoyed it much more. The only issue I have with it is that Disney already had a hand-drawn Nessie character from the 60's featurette ""Man, Monsters, and Mysteries"", available on the original, Gold Collection release of Pete's Dragon on DVD. Sorry, I get annoyed when Disney does that. Let's say the Nessie in this new short is the mother of the male, modern day one from the old featurette... Anywho, besides the lovely new short cartoon, we also get a nice behind the scenes featurette that gives us a pleasing look at the origins of Winnie the Pooh as well, and  there are also some great deleted scenes, a sing-along viewing option, and this shortened version of an old Pooh classic that I guess is some new gimmick for showing the film to short-attention span viewers on the Disney Channel, much like the butchered ""Have a Laugh"" cartoons they introduced a while back. DO NOT support that Have a Laugh stuff.And, that's about it for this one. If you LOVE Disney and Winnie the Pooh, you NEED to own this on Blu-Ray. If you don't, well, not sure why you'd want to, but it's great stuff anyway. If you only liked the original Pooh cartoons/feature, this is the one that is still worth your time, but I can't help but put in a plug for ""The Tigger Movie"" too. The other stuff varies in quality, but it's still generally pretty good, but this is on a whole other level, like the original animated works.

The characters tumble out of Shepard's lovely, evocative illustrations (or ""decorations"" as they were quaintly called on the original dust jackets). The warm golden-honey/earth tones that are maintained throughout this all too brief, barely full-length animated sequence, invite you to nestle in, all snug.Most of the plot elements are also taken directly from episodes in the books. There's Pooh's perennial search for honey. There's the search for Eeyore's tail. There's the concerted effort to foil the dread ""Backson"" (shortened from the dread ""Spotted or Herbaceous Backson"" that owl conjured for his less literate brethren in the original).But something is lacking here. It's hard to say what it is. However, I don't think you'll be eternally charmed by the Pooh band if this is your only exposure to them.Maybe Tigger is a big part of the problem. He's voiced like an old codger, instead of like the roaring, good-natured rumpus of a character he is in the books. What's more, he engages in some over-the-top fisticuffs that really turn almost brutal, breaking the spell of Pooh's enchanted woods. Perhaps the producers/writer for this film felt the original Pooh books were too tame and static for modern audiences of children - and so they injected some violent action into the proceedings, and tried to turn Tigger into an action-figure. But it doesn't work.Then there's something a little forced about Pooh's frequent mispronunciations. They are a little too frequent here. Pooh begins to sound like Archie Bunker in the later days of ""Archie's Place"" when the writers for that series spin-off had run out of plot ideas and relied instead on Archie's improbable word-manglings for most of the humor.Whatever it is, something is a little off in this translation of the books to screen. Of course it could be that I'm coming to it with the world-weary eye of an adult rather than with the wide-eyed innocence of childhood. Perhaps I, like Christopher Robin was fated to do, grew up and left the world of the Wood too far behind. But I don't think so.

The charms of this movie include the hand-drawn styles, a couple of clever songs (including the pretty voice of Zooey Deschanel), of course the classic character's were mostly handled with respect, and the interactions with the wording on the book's pages was at least clever.  But I felt that Eeyore's having lost his tail and the woods' denizens looking for it wasn't the best story to put up on the big screen.  It had some fun moments to it but it lacked the touch and overall deftness that a good Pooh story has with these iconic characters; it felt shallow.  That Tigger didn't dominate the movie was a pretty brave choice too (and a welcome one from my perspective) but it could have been so much better, as a children's movie, to have these characters overcome something that was truly frightening (as opposed to the notion that there are frightening things).  And since when did Owl become so dumb?This movie, made for children, is inoffensive and clever at times (by far too clever as young children won't get the jokes of the characters misunderstanding each other or what is going on because of how different words can sound the same), and it won't turn off any Pooh afficionados but I can't see it making that many new friends for Pooh and his friends.  Still, there's certainly far, far, far worse out there to which we can subject the kiddies.One last thing: as an adult watching this fare I appreciated the voice cast (never pin-pointed Craig Ferguson! as Owl) as it didn't take me out of the movie with an ""Oh!  I know who that is!"" type of moment except when Deschanel sang.  She has a winsome, lovely voice but she has been so all over TV and movies for the past few years all I could do was see her in my mind's eye when she sang.  But maybe that's just my own issue...

1456706,AID8OJP77VK6Y,B005ELMC0G,unicornelia,"[5, 6]","Don't read this if you desire to hear no spoilers whatsoever. ;)This adorable little movie was a very nice return to the quaint, classic, storybook-style Hundred Acre Woods, complete with interactive text. Many of the voices were, unfortunately, while not bad, too different to feel comfortable transitioning from the ones I'm used to. I dearly wished for the old Rabbit, Owl, Kanga, etc. Even Tigger sounded somehow slightly different from his usual self, although it was obviously still Jim Cummings. Pooh himself was the one who sounded the most like he always has--which is to say, completely the same. I love Bud Luckey, and he was a good choice for Eeyore, but there's simply no replacing the originals. I kept picturing the Jackalope from ""Boundin'"" the entire time, lol. (Or Chuckles from ""Toy Story III,"" or Rick Dicker from ""The Incredibles""...) It wasn't their fault, of course, that things couldn't be kept perfectly consistent--and indeed, these characters have changed voice actors before. Somehow, though, for the most part, all of the older ones felt more similar, more right, more appropriate, and more readily acceptable.A few moments struck me as feeling slightly out-of-character, such as Roo's ""Send in the pig""--which was a funny line, regardless. Otherwise, the movie didn't feel very ""modern,"" which was a good thing. (And as a side note, I am convinced that Piglet is at least an armadillig, if not a ""purebred"" armadillo, despite his name and the frequent references to him being a ""swine."")The songs were quite cute; I actually found myself humming or singing a few of them later on! They may not be the best or most memorable songs ever written for Pooh (those are still nearly impossible to equal), but they were good, and got my seal of approval. Zooey Deschanel's lovely, lilting tune that plays during the end credits is an added treat; in fact, she has a great musical talent, on par with her pop star doppelg&auml;nger. ;)The movie IS rather short, perhaps just barely a full-length feature, so I am somewhat glad to have watched it at home, but I think that it still would have been a very worthwhile and enjoyable theater experience. The three basic storylines (Pooh's quest for honey, the search for a new Eeyore tail, and the ""Backson"" problem) were absolutely classic Pooh, and kept the film flowing along nicely. It had the cozy, warm, fuzzy quality of old Pooh--which is exactly what I was expecting, and the reason you should see it.Its animation is marvelous--warm, old-fashioned, richly detailed, and true to the classics, although very exaggerated at times (e.g., Rabbit's facial expressions while trapped in the hole. Nothing wrong with this; it was quite amusing...just a tad surprising because it seemed more extreme than what I anticipated.) I always miss Gopher, whom rarely appears in newer Pooh movies.It must be said that the ""Backson"" storyline was very similar to the plot of ""Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin."" Owl misreads a harmless note left casually by Christopher to let his Hundred Acre Wood friends know that he'd be away for a spell, and works everyone up into a tizzy because he interprets it as a cry for help. Conjuring up images of deathly peril for Christopher and epic adventures for his friends as they try to save him, he leads the gang in a song, ultimately chickening out of the whole thing himself. Sound like way too much coincidence? Oh, definitely. There is no way they weren't intending to create another version of this, a variation on that theme. Why would one not expect Owl to do such a thing twice, or for the others not to be just as vulnerable to his sensational errors again? These characters, even the more intelligent ones, have never exactly been creatures of very much brain. ;)So, yes...as Pooh is forever seeking his beloved ""hunny"" (but ultimately caring about nothing more than his friends), and Eeyore will probably never stop losing his tail and his house, this movie was primarily based upon things we have seen before. It really went back to the roots of Pooh, which is great--rather than being disappointing because we'd ""seen it before,"" it was refreshing to watch such pure, awesome Poohness again, in a different way. The ""swimming in the giant pot of honey"" was definitely reminiscent of past dream/fantasy sequences. ""Pooh's Grand Adventure"" is, however, one of my favorite movies and, I believe, a superior one in just about every way. Its story, songs, animation, script, characterization, etc., are utter perfection; I give it a full 10/10. This new 2011 film gets a solid 8 from me.What this really makes you want to do is watch the all-time best Winnie the Pooh productions:*Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree*Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day*Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore*Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too*The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (including holiday specials such as Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too or Spookable Pooh, and the adventure- and learning-based video collections)*Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher RobinI mean, I could not possibly stress enough how every line, song, scene, scary bit, moving moment, and other memorable element of those episodes and features just sticks with you forever and floods you with happiness each time you think about it, no matter what. I can't imagine calling a childhood complete without growing up on those until they, like the thousands of other threads that make up the quilt of mine, are indelibly ingrained into one's mind and memory. Yeah...they are just that amazing.More recent movies such as The Book of Pooh, Piglet's Big Movie, Pooh's Heffalump Movie, or The Tigger Movie, have all been cute and worth the watch, earning 6s or 7s from me...maybe one 5.Bottom line: ""Winnie the Pooh"" is strongly recommended!!",4,The best Pooh release in years!,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,5835,"['Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'desire', 'hear',
