It could have been presented darkly as passion or lightly as a father-daughter relationship.  But it just wavered there with no resolution.I agree with another reviewer that the pirates seemed pretty tame.

I expected a somewhat cheap and mediocre movie based partially on the fact that I had never heard of the movie before. However, there are two good stars to anchor the film, and the young supporting cast (particularly Deborah Baxter) steals the show.The basic gist is that a group of kids accidentally end up on a pirate ship where Anthony Quinn is the captain and James Coburn is his right hand man. While they are pirates, they are somewhat lovable, and their reaction to the kids makes them quite endearing. The kids are quite innocent and funny, and of course they create havoc aboard the ship.Emily (played by Baxter) is wonderful as a cute little girl who kind of takes charge among the kids. She flashes back and forth between being a typical little kid who does silly stuff and being quite grown up. Ultimately, she and Quinn form the primary characters in the movie, and both characters win their way into your heart.The ending is somewhat surprising (at least it was for me), but it is a very solid ending to top off this very good little film.

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[5, 5]","I recently read the novel A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes, and found the book sort of a cross between Treasure Island and Huckleberry Finn, the former because the plot concerns children in the hands of pirates; but the style is more humorous and sophisticated, reminding me a bit of Twain, though more cynical, almost like Lord of the Flies.The first quarter of the novel covers the lives of the Thornton children in Jamaica in the mid-nineteenth cetury.  Most of that is absent from the movie, which starts with a hurricane. Then the children set sail for England and are kidnapped by pirates, and suspense builds through the rest of the film, along with a good deal of humor, some cynical, and some mildly shocking events - one accident and later an even more serious crime than piracy.  The children, unsupervised, appear to be turning more evil than their pirate hosts.  Unusual and amusing events depicted are just surprising enough to ring true.This film version starring Anthony Quinn and James Coburn (as the pirates) follows the novel reasonably well, but as is always the case in adaptations the viewer can't experience the depth of the narrative, and some of the characters are not even established, let alone developed.  I felt I might not have followed the story had I not read the book.  However, there is a line at the end of the film that helps drive the point home, when a cab driver ironically tells Mr. Thornton that he must be proud of his children.Overall the film is unique and interesting, a good find if you're tired of the same old formulae.",5,"Unique, interesting, & surprising adventure.",1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,1575,"['recently', 'read', 'novel', 'A', 'High', 'Wind', 'Jamaica', 'Richard', 'Hughes', 'found', 'book', 'sort', 'cross', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'former', 'plot', 'concerns', 'children', 'hands', 'pirates', 'style', 'more', 'humorous', 'sophisticated', 'reminding', 'bit', 'Twain', 'more', 'cynical', 'almost', 'Lord', 'Flies.The', 'first', 'quarter', 'novel', 'lives', 'Thornton', 'children', 'Jamaica', 'mid-nineteenth', 'cetury', 'Most', 'absent', 'movie', 'hurricane', 'Then', 'children', 'set', 'sail', 'England', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'pirates', 'suspense', 'builds', 'rest', 'film', 'good', 'deal', 'humor', 'cynical', 'mildly', 'shocking', 'events', 'one', 'accident', 'later', 'even', 'more', 'serious', 'crime', 'piracy', 'children', 'unsupervised', 'appear', 'be', 'turning', 'more', 'evil', 'pirate', 'hosts', 'Unusual', 'amusing', 'events', 'depicted', 'are', 'just', 'surprising', 'enough', 'ring', 'true.This', 'film', 'version', 'starring', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'James', 'Coburn', 'pirates', 'novel', 'reasonably', 'well', 'always', 'case', 'adaptations', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'experience', 'depth', 'narrative', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'established', 'let', 'alone', 'developed', 'felt', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'followed', 'story', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'However', 'line', 'end', 'film', 'drive', 'point', 'home', 'when', 'cab', 'driver', 'ironically', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'must', 'be', 'proud', 'children.Overall', 'film', 'unique', 'interesting', 'good', 'find', ""'re"", 'tired', 'same', 'old', 'formulae']",N/A

I totally agree with a previous review by subscriber &#34;movielover.&#34;  HORRIBLE MOVIE.  HORRIBLE, WITH A CAPITAL H.  I also might add that I did not care for the portrayal of quasi-sexual scenes between Anthony Quinn and a ten year-old girl.  You know like when he gets on top of her and pins her down on the deck and they look at each other for 10 seconds straight, a long time in movies, and then he gets up off of her and the pirates all laugh and cheer.  And there are others.  Like the way the little girl is somehow portrayed by the writers and directors as attractive to become a prostitute in a Jamaican brothel.  How does that work for 10 year-old girl, Hollywood? I guess I don't get that.  Then the extended scene in Quinn's cabin that is closeup and ackwardly long due to its obvious sexual inuendos where the little girl says, &#34;hold me.&#34;  This borders on the sexual exploitation of children.  What was Quinn thinking when he took this role?  Did Roman Polanski secretly direct this degradation of children?  How can reviewers give this thing five stars after these scenes?  I found the movie not only awful, I found it offensive and exploitative of children.  Amazon should not offer it for sale.  I encourage Amazon after reading my review here to go watch the movie and observe these scenes I have discussed.  Don't tell me I'm wrong, because I'm not.  In the movie &#34;Father Goose,&#34; Cary Grant is swooned over by a under-18 young girl, but it is seen by all as clearly that...nothing but infatuation by her and he laughs it off.

807365,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0001I56FK,Trevor Willsmer,"[10, 11]","A major influence on John Milius' The Wind and the Lion (Milius would even cast its leading child actress, Deborah Baxter, in his film), Alexander Mackendrick's film of A High Wind in Jamaica is a little too safe for too much of its running time to really capture the heart of childish darkness of the novel. It starts well with the white family praying to God and their black servants sacrificing a chicken in a voodoo ceremony as they both shelter from a fierce storm in the basement of their plantation building, setting up the conflict not just between different cultures but also the generations with the innocent and indifferent fascination children have with the things their elders find most repellent. Yet when they find themselves accidental hostages of Anthony Quinn and James Coburn's pirates, their childish games driving the superstitious crew ever closer to mutiny and the story closer to tragedy, it's somewhat undermined by the fact that these pirates are a surprisingly passive and well behaved lot. Yet when it finally does move into darker waters, it's surprisingly powerful and effective, and there's a real sense of loss to the ending. If the film occasionally threatens to go all Disney on you and isn't up to the standard of Mackendrick's best work, it does share his understanding of how children really behave with films like Mandy, and it also features a surprisingly beautiful full orchestral score by Larry Adler.Fox's DVD is a good one, boasting a fine widescreen 2.35:1 and panned-and-scanned fullscreen transfers, trailer and trailers for The Black Swan, Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World and Pirates of Tortuga.",3,Not quite savage enough,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,1659,"['major', 'influence', 'John', 'Milius', 'Wind', 'Lion', 'Milius', 'would', 'even', 'cast', 'leading', 'child', 'actress', 'Deborah', 'Baxter', 'film', 'Alexander', 'Mackendrick', 'film', 'A', 'High', 'Wind', 'Jamaica', 'little', 'too', 'safe', 'too', 'much', 'running', 'time', 'really', 'capture', 'heart', 'childish', 'darkness', 'novel', 'well', 'white', 'family', 'praying', 'God', 'black', 'servants', 'sacrificing', 'chicken', 'voodoo', 'ceremony', 'shelter', 'fierce', 'storm', 'basement', 'plantation', 'building', 'setting', 'up', 'conflict', 'not', 'just', 'different', 'cultures', 'also', 'generations', 'innocent', 'indifferent', 'fascination', 'children', 'have', 'things', 'elders', 'find', 'most', 'repellent', 'when', 'find', 'accidental', 'hostages', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'James', 'Coburn', 'pirates', 'childish', 'games', 'driving', 'superstitious', 'crew', 'ever', 'closer', 'mutiny', 'story', 'closer', 'tragedy', 'somewhat', 'undermined', 'fact', 'pirates', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'passive', 'well', 'behaved', 'lot', 'when', 'finally', 'move', 'darker', 'waters', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'effective', 'real', 'sense', 'loss', 'ending', 'film', 'occasionally', 'go', 'Disney', ""n't"", 'up', 'standard', 'Mackendrick', 'best', 'work', 'share', 'understanding', 'how', 'children', 'really', 'behave', 'films', 'Mandy', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'beautiful', 'full', 'orchestral', 'score', 'Larry', 'Adler.Fox', 'DVD', 'good', 'one', 'boasting', 'fine', 'widescreen', '2.35:1', 'panned-and-scanned', 'fullscreen', 'transfers', 'trailer', 'trailers', 'Black', 'Swan', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'Pirates', 'Tortuga']",N/A
