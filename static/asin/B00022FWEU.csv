821659,A19HQVND02SRWE,B00022FWEU,Alan,"[28, 31]","The first two seasons of Sliders are fantastic.  Unfortunately, the seasons following were much less so.  But with this set, you get the good stuff.  Grad student Quinn Mallory creates a device that allows him, two friends, and an innocent bystander to ""slide"" between parallel Earths -- but unfortunately, they can't choose their destination, and must continue to slide until they find home.I'd love to give this set 5 stars, but can't for two reasons.  First, as mentioned by just about every other reviewer, the packaging is HORRIBLE.  I don't know if this was done for aesthetics or cheaper manufacturing costs (I suspect the latter), but it's just inexcusable.  The other reason is the ""Invasion"" episode: series co-creator Tracy Torme wanted to do ""hardcore"" and ""dark"" science fiction, but this episode goes beyond that: it casts a shadow of doom over the entire series -- the Kromaggs are out there, and they are coming.  Not only does it establish this ever-present threat, but it also lays the groundwork for further damage to the series later on -- in an episode of a later season, it is establish that Quinn is NOT from our world, but rather from a world where his ""real"" parents were sliders who placed him on our world to escape the Kromaggs, and that he also has a brother on a different Earth.  This episode is more destructive than any other episode I've seen of any other series.  Not to mention it's got an EXTREMELY weak script, with dialog that would make Ed Wood blush!  Ironically, the network was opposed to this one -- for once, the suits were right.One other point of interest: the episodes in this set are presented in broadcast order, not the order they were intended to be shown.  Several season one episodes were written and filmed to lead into the next, but because the network shuffled them around there were minor continuity issues.  One of the other reviewers posted the correct order of the episodes (thanks!), but I'm not going to reprint it here because I don't want to steal that person's helpful votes.  But I recommend finding that review, and watching the episodes in the intended order.",4,A great show given poor treatment by the network,1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,2128,"['first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Sliders', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Unfortunately', 'seasons', 'following', 'were', 'much', 'less', 'so', 'set', 'get', 'good', 'stuff', 'Grad', 'student', 'Quinn', 'Mallory', 'device', 'two', 'friends', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'slide', 'parallel', 'Earths', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'choose', 'destination', 'must', 'continue', 'slide', 'find', 'home.I', ""'d"", 'love', 'give', 'set', '5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'mentioned', 'just', 'other', 'reviewer', 'packaging', 'HORRIBLE', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'done', 'aesthetics', 'cheaper', 'manufacturing', 'costs', 'suspect', 'latter', 'just', 'inexcusable', 'other', 'reason', 'Invasion', 'episode', 'series', 'co-creator', 'Tracy', 'Torme', 'wanted', 'do', 'hardcore', 'dark', 'science', 'fiction', 'episode', 'shadow', 'doom', 'entire', 'series', 'Kromaggs', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'coming', 'Not', 'only', 'establish', 'ever-present', 'threat', 'also', 'groundwork', 'further', 'damage', 'series', 'later', 'episode', 'later', 'season', 'establish', 'Quinn', 'NOT', 'world', 'rather', 'world', 'where', 'real', 'parents', 'were', 'sliders', 'who', 'placed', 'world', 'escape', 'Kromaggs', 'also', 'brother', 'different', 'Earth', 'episode', 'more', 'destructive', 'other', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'series', 'Not', 'mention', 'got', 'EXTREMELY', 'weak', 'script', 'dialog', 'would', 'make', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'blush', 'Ironically', 'network', 'was', 'opposed', 'one', 'once', 'suits', 'were', 'right.One', 'other', 'point', 'interest', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'presented', 'broadcast', 'order', 'not', 'order', 'were', 'intended', 'be', 'shown', 'Several', 'season', 'one', 'were', 'written', 'filmed', 'lead', 'next', 'network', 'shuffled', 'were', 'minor', 'continuity', 'issues', 'One', 'other', 'reviewers', 'posted', 'correct', 'order', 'episodes', 'thanks', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'reprint', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'steal', 'person', 'helpful', 'votes', 'recommend', 'finding', 'review', 'watching', 'episodes', 'intended', 'order']",N/A
821660,A15IKI9BAE75T2,B00022FWEU,Alex G,"[6, 7]","Sliders was a super show. Tracy Torme', fresh off of work with Star Trek Next Gen, continued her success with the brilliant Sliders show. Great hook, with Quinn Mallory, a boy genius/physicist/string theoretician, comes up with a workable Einstein-Rosen-Podosky bridge that opens wormholes to other parallel universes, a novel take off of one of the NGen Treks, called Parallaxes, I think.Wonderful concept, augmented by superb acting by Jerry O'Connell, Sabrina Lloyd, John Rhys-Davies, and multi-talented Cleavant Derricks, as Rembrandt Brown. Nice touch having Quinn asleep in bed, with his clothes (and his glasses) still on, after tapping out in the middle of the night reading Kaku's Hyperspace, a book about 10 dimensions, and parallel universes, and the possibilities of string theory, as the show opens.Very intelligent show, as Quinn and his compatriots zap from one weird version of our world, to another, with history and events unfolding a bit differently on each world. Like Star Trek, this is the kind of top drawer sci-fi show that comes along only once every 20 years or so. Seasons 1-4 were their best, in my book, but that is just me.I WOULD HAVE given this 5 stars, however, the packaging is as cheap and ordinary as humanly possible. What?? Why? AND where is Danny Lux's extraordinary theme song? Surely the distributor or studio wasn't too cheap to pay him some royalties for his work. Sliders without the Slider theme, is not right.  The 'new' theme is simply loud noise, to be blunt.Great memories, but an opportunity missed. It is wonderful to hear the surround sound, and excellent audio, (the mixers and audio people did an excellent job on Sliders) and see these classic characters the way they were meant to be seen. Luckily, Season 3 was packaged differently, and, as of yet, I have not discovered whether they ditched the original music there as well, or not. Caveat Emptor, there.I love this series. And these are great dvds. But, were they done in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen, with quality disk holders, good packaging, AND Danny Lux's original music, these might have been PHENOMENAL! What a shame. Why settle for very good, when greatness was at your fingertips? Anyway, it is still a fun romp through adventure after adventure.",4,"Great show, but where is Danny Lux's super  theme music???",1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,2262,"['Sliders', 'was', 'super', 'show', 'Tracy', 'Torme', 'fresh', 'work', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Gen', 'continued', 'success', 'brilliant', 'Sliders', 'show', 'Great', 'hook', 'Quinn', 'Mallory', 'boy', 'genius/physicist/string', 'theoretician', 'up', 'workable', 'Einstein-Rosen-Podosky', 'bridge', 'wormholes', 'other', 'parallel', 'universes', 'novel', 'take', 'off', 'one', 'NGen', 'Treks', 'called', 'Parallaxes', 'think.Wonderful', 'concept', 'augmented', 'superb', 'acting', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'multi-talented', 'Cleavant', 'Derricks', 'Rembrandt', 'Brown', 'Nice', 'touch', 'having', 'Quinn', 'asleep', 'bed', 'clothes', 'glasses', 'still', 'tapping', 'out', 'middle', 'night', 'reading', 'Kaku', 'Hyperspace', 'book', '10', 'dimensions', 'parallel', 'universes', 'possibilities', 'string', 'theory', 'show', 'opens.Very', 'intelligent', 'show', 'Quinn', 'compatriots', 'zap', 'one', 'weird', 'version', 'world', 'history', 'events', 'unfolding', 'bit', 'differently', 'world', 'Star', 'Trek', 'kind', 'top', 'drawer', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'only', 'once', '20', 'years', 'so', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'were', 'best', 'book', 'just', 'me.I', 'WOULD', 'HAVE', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'however', 'packaging', 'cheap', 'ordinary', 'humanly', 'possible', 'What', 'Why', 'where', 'Danny', 'Lux', 'extraordinary', 'theme', 'song', 'Surely', 'distributor', 'studio', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'cheap', 'pay', 'royalties', 'work', 'Sliders', 'Slider', 'theme', 'not', 'right', ""'new"", 'theme', 'simply', 'loud', 'noise', 'be', 'blunt.Great', 'memories', 'opportunity', 'missed', 'wonderful', 'hear', 'surround', 'sound', 'excellent', 'audio', 'mixers', 'audio', 'people', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Sliders', 'see', 'classic', 'characters', 'way', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'Luckily', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'packaged', 'differently', 'yet', 'have', 'not', 'discovered', 'ditched', 'original', 'music', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'Caveat', 'Emptor', 'there.I', 'love', 'series', 'are', 'great', 'dvds', 'were', 'done', '16:9', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'quality', 'disk', 'holders', 'good', 'packaging', 'Danny', 'Lux', 'original', 'music', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'PHENOMENAL', 'What', 'shame', 'Why', 'settle', 'very', 'good', 'when', 'greatness', 'was', 'fingertips', 'Anyway', 'still', 'fun', 'romp', 'adventure', 'adventure']",N/A

It combines the best elements of ""Quantum Leap"" and ""Voyagers"", giving you four heroes that you come to truly care about.The basic story is that boy-genius Quinn Mallory accidentally opens a portal between dimensions on Earth. He, his girl friend, his physics professor and a has-been soul singer get pulled into a wormhole and begin sliding through different dimensions.The various worlds that our heroes travel to are imaginative, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, but always fun. All of the inventive predicaments the Sliders find themselves in will keep you entertained, a San Francisco that is a maximum security prison, an American that is ruled by Russia, a world where the male population has been rendered sterile, a world where Howard Stern became leader and anyone over 30 years of age is a second class citizen, or a world where Dinosaurs still roam the Earth.The casting is great, Jerry O'Connell as Quinn Mallory, is perfect, someone you can really root for and like. Cleavant Derricks plays Rembrandt Brown, a once-famous soul singer dragged along by accident on the first slide. John Rhys-Davies as the pompous professor Arturo is hilarious, but also gives the group a leader, and Sabrina Lloyd as Wade Welles, Quinn's sometimes girlfriend, provides the heart and conscience of the group. You will come to appreciate each of the characters, and as the show progresses you really come to enjoy the interaction between them.It's easy to see why this show initially found such a small but devoted audience, and why even a decade later it's still such a cult hit. If you are a fan of sci-fi TV, give ""Sliders"" a shot, I'm sure you will enjoy it. Even if you don't like sci-fi in general, give ""Sliders"" a shot, as the characters, writing and charisma of the actors will hook you.Highly recommended.",5,Excellent Show Worth Discovering,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,2071,"['are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Sliders', 'only', 'know', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'aired', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'channel', 'urge', 'pick', 'up', '2', 'season', 'collection', 'Sliders', 'was', 'nifty', 'little', 'show', 'premiered', 'Fox', 'network', 'mid', '1990', 'best', 'elements', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Voyagers', 'giving', 'four', 'heroes', 'come', 'truly', 'care', 'about.The', 'basic', 'story', 'boy-genius', 'Quinn', 'Mallory', 'accidentally', 'portal', 'dimensions', 'Earth', 'girl', 'friend', 'physics', 'professor', 'has-been', 'soul', 'singer', 'get', 'pulled', 'wormhole', 'begin', 'sliding', 'different', 'dimensions.The', 'various', 'worlds', 'heroes', 'travel', 'are', 'imaginative', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'scary', 'always', 'fun', 'inventive', 'predicaments', 'Sliders', 'find', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'San', 'Francisco', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'American', 'ruled', 'Russia', 'world', 'where', 'male', 'population', 'been', 'rendered', 'sterile', 'world', 'where', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'became', 'leader', 'anyone', '30', 'years', 'age', 'second', 'class', 'citizen', 'world', 'where', 'Dinosaurs', 'still', 'Earth.The', 'casting', 'great', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Quinn', 'Mallory', 'perfect', 'someone', 'can', 'really', 'root', 'Cleavant', 'Derricks', 'Rembrandt', 'Brown', 'once-famous', 'soul', 'singer', 'dragged', 'along', 'accident', 'first', 'slide', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'pompous', 'professor', 'Arturo', 'hilarious', 'also', 'group', 'leader', 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'Wade', 'Welles', 'Quinn', 'sometimes', 'girlfriend', 'heart', 'conscience', 'group', 'will', 'come', 'appreciate', 'characters', 'show', 'really', 'come', 'enjoy', 'interaction', 'them.It', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'show', 'initially', 'found', 'such', 'small', 'devoted', 'audience', 'why', 'even', 'decade', 'later', 'still', 'such', 'cult', 'hit', 'are', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'TV', 'give', 'Sliders', 'shot', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'sci-fi', 'general', 'give', 'Sliders', 'shot', 'characters', 'writing', 'charisma', 'actors', 'will', 'hook', 'you.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Truth is, is that I haven't seen Sliders for some 6 or 7 years. It's not because I didn't want to, it's just because they stopped showing it. Now before you start thinking ""What the hell is this guy talking about?"" let me remind you that I live in London, and the BBC was my only way of seeing this programme. Anyway you know the rest. Last episode that I remember seeing of it was something about a world of homeless people or something, and it ended in an alley somewhere. It was pretty dodgy, but I was p****d off that it was the last one they ever showed.Anyway, to cut a long story short, I haven't seen Sliders for a hell of a long time, and for all I know, when I buy it, and see it again, I will hate every minute of it. Now that's just a possibility, but I can assure you, that when I was a kid and this show first started, nothing drew me towards the T.V in quite the same way (Until I found my brothers X Files tapes) and I quite frankly loved every minute of it.

I've been looking for it on DVD for years, and screamed my head off when I saw the ad in Entertainment  Weekly.  I'm thrilled to read so many positive reviews from other fans. I knew I wasn't alone, but it's great to know others were waiting just as impatiently as I was. The price isn't a deterrent, I've been waiting to long for this.I agree with one reviewer that once the show went to SciFi it started to go downhill. Actually, that's why Arturo (JRD) left, the scripts weren't as well written as they once were and I don't think the new writers or producers cared as much.  It's sad to look at early episodes and know that Arturo died and Wade got captured by the Kromags and Quinn and his brother ended up trapped in some kind of middle dimension between worlds.I knew things were bad when the 5th season started and Jerry O'Connell was a no show without any kind of wrap-up whatsoever.Anyway, the first three seasons are the best (IMO) because they showcased the group dynamic wonderfully, the stories were good, special effects were great, and the worlds were interesting not only on the surface, but they helped to intergrate the characters into more of a family unit.They learned things about themselves, about what they could accomplish together, alone and that friendships are important and can create a very strong bond, sometimes stronger than blood. I loved the premise that these four strangers (okay, Quinn, Wade and Prof. Arturo already knew each other), could become so close.I loved their inner circle and how they met others and temporarily let them into the fold, but ultimately it was all about the four of them.  Which is why I was so uncomfortable with Maggie and Quinn's brother. They felt like intrusions, even though it took me A LONG TIME to warm up to her.This show was fantastic and vastly undervalued and under appreciated. I look at my tapes and remember that it was on after The X-Files which is probably where it picked up its biggest fan base. I followed them until the fifth season, but sorry, I didn't want to invest into new characters, but I still loved Remy.Speaking of him, it's also great to see how he was transformed from the Stepin' fetchit comic relief, to an intelligent, helpful, devoted member of the group and a friend to all. He represented those of us with no special skills or 'brain busters'  who truly cared about his friends and would risk his life for them.

I kept asking myself ""why no world with no land masses or still in a molten state, or any world that would be instantly fatal?""

The general rule for them is followed closely here: if there are a bunch of scientists trapped on an island, the black helper will be the janitor or some other no-nothing. In Sliders, the black helper is a singer (sweeps up or sings) who gets accidentally swept up in a slide and ""Lordy-Lordy, whats we gonna dos?"" is his response to most situations.Watching old Doctor Who episodes would be a better use of your time than looking at this show.",1,"Bad, Cheap Sci-Fi with a ""Black Helper"" thrown in..",1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,1192,"['What', 'off', 'good', 'idea', 'show', 'quickly', 'degenerated', 'silly', 'waste', 'time', 'due', 'low', 'budget', 'unimaginative', 'scripts', 'mediocre', 'actors.The', 'main', 'plot', 'young', 'scientist', 'who', 'means', 'travel', 'other', 'dimensions', 'then', 'get', 'lost', 'one', 'along', 'girl', 'friend', 'fellow', 'scientist', 'played', 'John', 'Ryes', 'Davies', '.Of', 'course', 'due', 'miniscule', 'budget', 'none', 'other', 'worlds', 'are', 'terribly', 'interesting', 'kept', 'asking', 'why', 'world', 'land', 'still', 'molten', 'state', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'instantly', 'fatal', 'was', 'never', 'explained.What', 'worse', 'inclusion', 'Black', 'Helper', 'stock', 'minority', 'character', 'thrown', 'comic', 'relief/plot', 'exposition', 'purposes', 'general', 'rule', 'followed', 'closely', 'here', 'are', 'bunch', 'scientists', 'trapped', 'island', 'black', 'helper', 'will', 'be', 'janitor', 'other', 'no-nothing', 'Sliders', 'black', 'helper', 'singer', 'up', 'sings', 'who', 'accidentally', 'swept', 'up', 'slide', 'Lordy-Lordy', 'gon', 'dos', 'response', 'most', 'situations.Watching', 'old', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'use', 'time', 'looking', 'show']",N/A

However this boxset does not have the episodes in the correct order. So you must go to Wikipedia to find that order to watch this show. Fox was run by idiots who made them show it out of order and this boxset does the same thing. So don't just watch this , make a list and then watch it in the correct order. For these series we have our four adventurers sliding to many parallel worlds where the face various threats and situations. There's a lot of topical stories here and for it's day the effects were very good. but if you expect todays generation of cgi , then you will be mistaken. However in 95 and 96 this was a impressive show in that regard. The acting was lead by a fine cast that really did a good job at conveying the various doubles they would meet etc. The packaging is horrible though. But you don't buy a dvd boxset for the packaging. The show is currently being shown in correct order on the hub tv channel in HD. This is not in hd of course , but then few series are released that way.

The first two seasons contained the best writing and ideas of the series.The premise is so rich that as I watched these episodes again, the possibilities dwarfed the ability to present them. For those not familiar with the show, a young man creates the ability to open a ""wormhole"" which allows passage between present day earth and a parallel earth.  The concept allowed the exploration of endless potential outcomes.  If the Soviets had prevailed in the cold war, if the climate changed, if Dinosaurs were not extinct, and so on.  The possibilities were simply limited by the creativity of the writers.There are several episodes that stood out for me, but that is likely just personal preference.  The acting is as expected for a TV show, and the sets are unfortunately pretty standard.  Often, as in the pilot, they relied on ""red means go, green means stop"" types of scenes to show that this earth was not ours.  Some of the writing is a bit dated already.  There are however some great bits of special effects that are very well done.The packaging is unique, and not exactly in a good way.  The idea of presenting the discs as floating in the box is certainly creative, but not very practical or well done. From a video picture aspect all the discs I have viewed are clean and sharp and the quality is outstanding.  There is a lack of special features, and even the addition of trailers and other promotional materials would have been welcome.  The quality of what was presented though is excellent.Overall, this is one of the best premises ever to explore, and the show did an adequate job of it during these first two seasons.  I have enjoyed watching these again and still have quite a few episodes to get to when time allows.  I would recommend this set for other fans of the genre.  While it is TV and therefore is not as deep or highly produced as a film would be, it is nonetheless enjoyable.",4,One of the best premises ever for a show,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,2039,"['Having', 'been', 'fan', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'mid', '1990', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'presented', 'DVD', 'format', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'contained', 'best', 'writing', 'ideas', 'series.The', 'premise', 'so', 'rich', 'watched', 'episodes', 'again', 'possibilities', 'dwarfed', 'ability', 'present', 'not', 'familiar', 'show', 'young', 'man', 'ability', 'open', 'wormhole', 'passage', 'present', 'day', 'earth', 'parallel', 'earth', 'concept', 'allowed', 'exploration', 'endless', 'potential', 'outcomes', 'Soviets', 'had', 'prevailed', 'cold', 'war', 'climate', 'changed', 'Dinosaurs', 'were', 'not', 'extinct', 'so', 'possibilities', 'were', 'simply', 'limited', 'creativity', 'are', 'several', 'episodes', 'stood', 'out', 'likely', 'just', 'personal', 'preference', 'acting', 'expected', 'TV', 'show', 'sets', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'pretty', 'standard', 'Often', 'pilot', 'relied', 'red', 'go', 'green', 'stop', 'types', 'scenes', 'show', 'earth', 'was', 'not', 'ours', 'writing', 'bit', 'dated', 'already', 'are', 'however', 'great', 'bits', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done.The', 'packaging', 'unique', 'not', 'exactly', 'good', 'way', 'idea', 'presenting', 'discs', 'floating', 'box', 'certainly', 'creative', 'not', 'very', 'practical', 'well', 'done', 'video', 'picture', 'aspect', 'discs', 'have', 'viewed', 'are', 'clean', 'sharp', 'quality', 'outstanding', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'even', 'addition', 'trailers', 'other', 'promotional', 'materials', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'quality', 'what', 'was', 'presented', 'excellent.Overall', 'one', 'best', 'premises', 'ever', 'explore', 'show', 'did', 'adequate', 'job', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'again', 'still', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', 'get', 'when', 'time', 'would', 'recommend', 'set', 'other', 'fans', 'genre', 'TV', 'therefore', 'not', 'as', 'deep', 'highly', 'produced', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'nonetheless', 'enjoyable']",N/A

821702,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00022FWEU,Mitch Weaver,"[112, 120]","Quinn Mallory ( Jerry O Connel)is trying to create an anti-gravity device and accidentally creates a device that opens up a portal. His physics professor Maximillian P. Arturo (John Rhys-Davies), and his girlfriend Wade Wells (Sabrina Lloyd) want to accompany Quinn through the portal to see where it leads. A washed up singer named Rembrant Brown (Cleavant Derricks)is also accidentally dragged along for the ride, when he is walking buy and sucked through the portal with them. Quinn and the rest of the group ""slide"" to another dimension of earth. The Sliders soon realize that they would much rather return back to their own dimension, but things are not that easy. Once you have entered through the portal, you have to keep traveling to different dimensions of earth to find the right one that will lead back home. Each episode deals with Quinn, Professor Arturo, Wade, and Rembrant exploring each dimension to find their way back to their own dimension. Unfortunately, once the Sliders have entered a particular dimension, there is only a limited amount of time to reopen the portal, and there are only a few select places within each dimension they can do it from. Finding the right place to open the portal is often a challenge to the group because each dimension is different than their own, and can be life threatening at times.I have heard people often refer to Sliders as a rip off of Quantum Leap. While Quantum Leap was a better show, Sliders is completely different. Quinn, Professor Arturo, Wade, and Rembrant are not traveling through time. They are traveling through other dimensions of earth that differ from their own. This is what makes the show so great, because it is very interesting to see how each dimension will be different than the next. The show also offers tons of suspense. There is a ""race against the clock"" type feel due to the fact that the group only has a limited amount of time to find one of the few places within the dimension they can ""slide"" from. Jerry O Connel and the rest of the cast were excellent in their roles, and it is their performances that make the show so entertaining, especially the performance given from Cleavant Derricks as Rembrant Brown. The funniest thing about his character, is that Rembrant never asked to go with them, and was dragged along accidentally. So he often complains about each situation which usually provides for a lot of laughs.Unfortunately, Sliders did not manage to stay great for the entire run of the show. I have to agree with many of the fans and say that the show went seriously downhill during season three when Professor Arturo left the show. Seasons four and five would become even worse, because the show left FOX to air on the Sci-Fi channel, and by the end of the show, Rembrant was the only original character left. However, the first two seasons of Sliders are what make the show rank among the top of any television show in the sci-fi genre. The best thing about this DVD package, is the fact that you get the two best seasons of the show in one set.

They do not visit different planets, just different universes with other versions of Earth.  ""Sliders"" fits well into its format as a series as opposed to a movie.  It allows for alternate political and social scenarios and fascinating ""what if"" questions about history.Quinn Mallory, the main character, invents an interdimensional travel machine in his basement (where all great inventions are born, I guess). After successfully visiting another universe, he shows it to his physics  professor and they activate the machine and go to another world with Wade, a girl at Quinn's school, and Rembrandt Brown, a singer who was on his way to sing the national anthem at a ball game when his car happened to be swallowed up by the dimensional hole.  The world they get to is a frozen San Francisco and they are forced to activate the timer before it is ready when a snow tornado bears down on them.  As a result they cannot control what universe the timer opens up an interdimensional tunnel for or when it opens that tunnel.  The timer counts down when it will do so and the time can vary from a few minutes to several days.  They must always slide when the timer reaches zero or they will be trapped in whatever world they are in for years perhaps for life.After visiting worlds in which the United States never achieved independence from Britain, where intellectuals are superstars, and one where the 1960's counterculture blossomed in the 1990's (when this series was made), they eventually encounter other sliders.  These sliders are creepy aliens called Kromaggs except they are not actually aliens but rather an evolutionary rival of true humans from the same earth albeit another universe.  The Kromaggs use sliding technology to conquer the other earths.  These Kromaggs take on more importance in later seasons.I must also add that some of the worlds they visit have a lot of the same details of the sliders' home world including alternate versions of themselves.  For example one of the worlds they visit has its own Rembrandt Brown whose musical career was far more successful.  It is fascinating to watch them meet their doubles in these worlds.Again this is overall a good, fun series.  The characters are shallow but likable.

The main reason I wanted it was so that I would have something goofy and fun to watch, something that I remembered from the recent past. What I didn't remember was how great this show was! Well, at least these first two seasons. I may invest in Season 3, but that's probably it for my Sliders collection. To me, the second season especially should be ranked amongst the best of all science fiction television. The first season is excellent, but the show ideas for some of the episodes are a bit Quantum Leap-ish. By the time they reach the episode entitled ""Eggheads"" they found their stride. The following episode ""The King Is Back"" is one of the funniest things I've seen from any TV show. That was the brilliance of this show is that even though it was dramatic and suspenseful at times it was always funny. Cleavant Derricks is positioned as comedic relief and he is a riot! John Rhys-Davies has his moments as well. Like many science fiction shows and movies, the story of parallel worlds is based on actual scientific theories. Because of this, the show challenges some of it's viewers with scientific and mathematical theorems and discussions. I personally think this is a good balance because it makes the series seem smarter than the other shows out there. I do however have two complaints that do not diminish the quality of this show, but I feel I should mention. The packaging is just awful and probably quite cheap. Also, the episodes are shown by their original air dates. These were shown out of order for some idiotic reason when Fox first aired them. I recommend searching for an episode guide online and watching them as they were meant to be seen. Things will be a little less confusing in proper order.

Four people traveling from one parellel universe to another, the same city, but different realities.I was about 12 years old when this show premiered, I remember my family always watched it.  I had a short attention span, and would find something else better to do when the commercial breaks came.  This is my chance to catch all these beginning episodes, and with the original casts too.By the time I actually sat down to watch entire episodes, as a kid when the show was new, the professor character: Arturo was leaving the show (halfway through season three).  He was, and still is, my favorite character on the show.  That was a bummer. After buying this DVD set, I've really enjoyed the episodes.Now these episodes on the discs aren't in the order that they were intended to be.  When the show aired, the production company decided to play the episodes in the order that they wanted to.  Certain websites you can find online can give you the proper order.  One good example of the episodes being out of order is in season one:  an episode starts out with San Francisco being underwater, then two episodes later:  a giant tidal wave hits the city.  Yeah.These 23 episodes definally were the golden age of the series.  Two episodes from the end of season two (""Invasion""), we are introduced to the Slider characters' enemies, the Kromaggs.  A group of people that occur throughout the rest of the series from that point.  Many people (including myself) thought that the idea of giving the Sliders an enemy was a stupid idea.  Especially the cast of the show!  These Kromagg characters were actually the reason that the actor who plays Professor Arturo left the series in season three.  It's been said that the actor gives a very poor performance in the Kromaggs first episode ""Invasion"" out of protest.  And the rest of the cast are none too pleased either.So see how the show started in the Pilot episode.  See what the Sliders did in that first episode that made it so their chance of getting home in very slim.

With a talented ensemble cast (who seem to really enjoy their roles) and engaging writing, these early episodes provide hours of entertainment. Little jokes and one-liners I never caught when this show aired make a reviewing really enjoyable. During a recent snowstorm, I watched WAY too many of them in a row, and I enjoyed myself immensely. Contentwise, this collection would get five stars.So why only 3? Once again, a hardworking cast and writing staff are let down by producers (in this case producers of the DVD) who don't put the same effort into production. The DVDs are of mediocre quality. They contain lots of skips and rough patches no matter what DVD player I play them on. It's frustrating, especially during some of the more climactic episodes.Sliders' history as a television show has always served (or should serve) as a cautionary tale. This was a terrific show run into the ground by producers who thought in platitudes instead of fact. They cut out a talented female character and replaced her with a soft-core porn actress (not to mention the fact that they killed off a character everyone felt something for and replaced her with an unlikeable hag of a character) because they felt that viewers would like big boobs more than likeability. They cut down a tender, slow-growing story of love and caring between two characters because they felt people would prefer a sexier love interest storyline with more sexual innuendo(people didn't). They wrote off the heart of the show (and both characters who actually knew something about science according to the show's history) in order to maintain control when the actors in question expressed valid concerns about plotlines.Still, even though you know the later seasons will prove a hideous disappointment, these early episodes are well worth viewing, if you can get over the technical difficulties.

My VHS off-air tapes have gone the way of all things that dare battle the second law of thermodynamics, otherwise known as that evil force called ""entropy""...The fact this set costs more than mindless 80s rubbish like A-Team, Dukes of Hazzard, and Knight Rider rather suggests they're actually going to put out some decent quality discs.  And, as a customer who cares about product quality, I'm ecstatic.  I will happily spend more to get the best looking sound and video, especially for a series that outright DESERVES such quality.Of course, it's silly to rant about something I haven't seen, so I'll give my two cents on the series' seasons encompassed in this upcoming release:  22 episodes of the best Sliders eps ever made, and they're all in one set.  Combining seasons 1 and 2 to one set was a brilliant move on Universal's part, though season 1 being just 9 episodes with season 2 having 13...The first two years of Sliders were as creator Tracy Torme had envisioned the show to be.  Fun, dramatic, exciting, and a unique way of creating social commentary by creating a society loosely-based on historical events that took a different turn.  Using a theory surrounding parallel universes, the main characters went to parallel worlds where history had taken a different course.  As a result, they'd end up in seemingly bizarre situations and, indeed, get confused when they arrived in a dimension that seemed very nearly identical to their own (albeit with minor differences, posing the question ""Would they know if they made it back home?)Epsiodes to look out for are ""Pilot"", ""Fever"", ""Last Days"", ""Eggheads"", ""The King is Back"", ""Luck of the Draw"" (easily the best from season 1 though ""Pilot"" was pretty well rounded as well), and most of season 2 (barring ""Obsession"") though BIG KUDOS have to be mentioned for episodes ""Invasion"" and ""Post Traumatic Slide Syndrome"" which are not just great Sliders episodes, they outright change the face of the sci-fi genre.  They are NOT to be missed!!I wish Rembrandt had been given consistently good treatment throughout the series' run.  He was envisioned as being the ""common guy"" of the group; how any of us might act if put into that situation, and I saw what they were trying to do.  But others denounced the show as being racist because Remmy just happened to be black.  I disagree with their assertion...  But some writers did treat Rembrandt unfairly, giving him the slapstick comedy while everybody else did the brainy stuff.  It depends on the episode, some treated Rembrandt as if he had intelligence too, fortunately!Oh.  FOX's season 3 of the show was 99.8% crap with only ""Double Cross"" being watchable (the series became a ""Let's rip off a popular movie every week"" joke), and the Sci-fi channel's production team changed the premise and humanized the Kromaggs by making them into a generic military army...  yuck, it wasn't worth the $50/month just to get sci-fi channel to watch that drivel, though ""Virtual Slide"" was great and ""Slidecage"" was surprisingly good, despite the change of series' premise by that point...

821727,A2EGXV8S6URQ8U,B00022FWEU,Visor,"[7, 16]","I managed to catch the first season of this show when it originally aired on Fox.  The first three episodes (Pilot, Fever, Last Days) were very promising, but unfortunately the show's quality started to fall after that, so I quit watching after the end of the first season.  I never really came back to it until this DVD set came out.  I took advantage of zip.ca to rent out all the discs of the set to take a trip down memory lane and find out where the show went.As I said, the first three aired episodes were really, REALLY good.  Little did I know at the time, but Fox aired Fever and Last Days out of order, presumably to show off their best episodes early and build a fanbase quickly.  Also, these episodes dealt with the building relationship between Quinn and Wade, which unfortunately was all-but axed for the rest of the show (another reason for why I dropped the series).Most of the episodes for seasons 1 &amp; 2 started to fall into a formula: slide into weird world, get split up, fight to get back together, and slide out just in the nick of time.  Some of the worlds were fairly interesting, other worlds were just bland (take the episode &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Wealthy&quot;, for example).  Also, the episodes didn't link up into any kind of story arc... you could miss 10 episodes and not miss a beat.  I guess makes it easier for new fans to join the series, but it doesn't exactly give the viewer much to look forward to when the stories just seem to be looping over and over.The series was shot in Vancouver, Canada.  Although I live in Canada, I can't give them many points for shooting up here, because it really kills the believability that they're supposed to be in San Fransisco.  Come on, you're trying to make me believe that SF is so cold that you can see the breath from the actors in most of the episodes?  There's even snow in some of the episodes... does SF even HAVE snow??  I now understand why people like David Duchovony wanted to move the X-Files production shooting to the U.S.  Another example was when I watched the first 10 or so episodes of Stargate SG-1, but ended up quitting because I was getting really sick of seeing episode after episode of the characters visiting alien planets that strangely looked like B.C. rainforests.Anyway, the Sliders series FINALLY starts to get promising near the end of the second season with episode &quot;Invasion&quot;.  It seems a radical race of ape-like earthlings called the Kromagg have mastered sliding, and are able to dial-an-Earth to conquer any destination they'd like.  The episode ends on a cliffhanger (maybe the second season was supposed to end with this cliffhanger; the episodes were shuffled again this season).  I wonder how well the Kromagg were incorperated in future seasons...If you're a sci-fi freak who can't get enough of weekly sci-fi shows (no matter how thin they stretch their budgets and stories), then this show is for you.

It would have been honest if they would have said ""selected episodes"" or ""collection"" rather than ""season one and two"" which surely leads people to believe that it contains the complete seasons. Besides being dishonest, it also means that there is no continuity between shows. At the last of an episode, you see the ""teaser"" for the next slide, but the next show is not the same as the teaser and it is not on any of the other disks. When they took an additional person with them on a slide, she was just not there on the next episode. You never know what happened to her.The first time that they made President George W. Bush look like an idiot in another world, it was a bit unique and a bit funny. But, show after show, they slam conservative attitudes, republicans in particular, military, and law enforcement.

Even Hansel and Gretel knew to leave those behind but, of course, the birds ate them so, perhaps it might not have helped Quinn Mallory to leave a trail behind. If he had done so in the pilot there wouldn't have been a series and that's what it's all about. &quot;Sliders&quot; arrived on the scene and immediately faced critical barbs. Some folks accused it of being a rip off of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;. It wasn't any more a rip off than &quot;Babylon 5&quot; was a rip off of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They both used unique devices to let their characters travel to different situations.Quinn Mallory accidently discovers a key to opening wormholes when he creates a device to defy gravity. Unfortunately, he, Wade (Sabrina Lloyd), his physics professor (John Rhys-Davies) and a washed up r&b; singer named Rembrandt (Clevant Derrick)who happens to be passing by on his way to sing at an San Francisco Giants game get sucked into the wormhole when a power surge causes it to go out of control.They discover that there are other worlds with intelligent life. Most of those other worlds are alternate Earths that have followed very different paths than our world. Unfortunately, Quinn has no way for them to get back home so they must keep sliding (the portals open on an unpredictable time schedule allowing them only so many hours in each world)from alternate universe to alternate universe hoping they'll eventually slide home.Created by Tracy Torme (who was a staff writer on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and for trivia buffs the son of singer Mel Torme)and Robert Weiss, the series started off with a lot of potential. Although the quality varied a bit from year to year, the best stories were always interesting and the performances were, for the most part, very convincing.We get the shortened first and second season here in a box that is packaged in a half cardboard half clear plastic box with the DVDs suspended by a foam core. It creates the illusion that they're suspected in the middle with out any means of support. It looks quite cool. The picture quality is very good with few blemishes and the sound has exceptional mastering as well. I didn't detect a lot of compression or distortion. So the show looks great and tastes great, too.The extras are lean. We get a featurette on the making of the show and a stills gallery but that's about it. On the back is a one sheet with info on the DVD when you fold it out it has an episode guide but without any cast listing or crew credits. When yo pop in each disc and select an episode you get an on screen symposis similar to that on the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; first season set. I have to give Universal praise for putting both the first and second season in one set (unlike &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;) although the price is a bit high especially when compared to another release from the same day, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. That set retails for about 1/3 less than &quot;Sliders&quot; and it has more features (although the design of the box isn't quite as sharp). Clearly Universal has the impression that this series is going to appeal to a cult audience and, as such, as tried to make it as attractive looking as possible.We only get a commentary track on the pilot by Torme and Weiss. While it's interesting and provides fascinating tidbits about pre-production, production and post-production problems the crew ran into, I would also have liked to hear from the original cast members as well. The show has aged surprisingly well although not all the CGI effects have held up but then again that's true of most movies and television shows. The CGI effects work at moving the story forward and that's their purpose. I would have liked to have a featurette on the CGI visual effects, more commentary on the various directions the show took over time, etc. Perhaps that'll be on the next couple of sets.While I like the unique design, the box can be a bit of a pain to put back together and it might not withstand wear and tear as much simpler sets. I'd suggest buying a couple of amray DVD containers and putting them in there and keeping your box as a colletible. It almost looks cool enough to put on display.There's been lots of discussion about the varied quality of the show over the years. It doesn't matter.
