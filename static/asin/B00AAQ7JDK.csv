A high school science teacher must get his family to safety before the hurricanes merge, creating a ""hypercane"" with the power to wipe the America off the map.After Super Cyclone, I was really hesitant to buy any Asylum movie about storms and the like. Super Cyclone, in my opinion, was literally the worst Asylum movie that I've ever watched. Thankfully, I viewed 40 Days & Nights. Because of that movie, I decided to take a chance on 500 MPH Storm. It's good that I did because 500 MPH Storm turned out to be a decent movie. not quite up to the standards of 40 Days & Nights but dang near close. Nevertheless, it was an entertaining movie that kept me interested(in that B-movie sort of way). I'll admit, however, that the movie does have it's moments where I felt like getting up and switching the DVD player off.As for how I'd rate this item, It was okay for an Asylum movie.

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[1, 1]","For movies titled"" GatorBear,"" ""True UFO Tales,"" or ""500 mph Storm,""  (I made the first two up in case you were wondering) I don't expect Oscar-worthy performances.  I usually end up being pleasantly surprised at the effort put forth by the actors.  I mean, they are getting paid and having fun, right?  But in 500 mph Storm, the bad acting by the trio of protagonists led by the scientist (Caspar Van Diem) is taken to a whole new level of bad.  Maybe they were forced to do this movie through blackmail, or as a probation requirement.  They were not having fun at all, and the horrible script did not help.  Actually, I ended up laughing at totally random things that happened in the film.  There is one scene where this young blond thing walks by and says very seductively that the something is at ""full capacity.""  At that point I started seeing this movie as an unintentional comedy.The family that is escaping from the storm is the stupidest trio you have ever met.  The son is an idiot, the wife is an airhead, and the dad is supposedly a brilliant scientist, but he makes the worst decision early in the movie, and that is to leave a sweet helpless, dog to meet it's death in the road!  Now the viewer hates you, good move.  From that point, when a tornado was chasing them, I cheered for the tornado.The CGI effects, the sound, the wardrobe, sets, cinematography is all very good.

He's got to put food on the table I suppose right?I am a huge fan of dumb low budget weather related Sci Fi flicks and this one is pretty dumb.  Bad, bad acting, terrible, no wait...AWFUL script and a snot nosed teenaged kid who needs to be smacked upside the head for his snarky attitude towards his parents.Early in the film, Van Dien, driving away from the storm after ballooning, contorts his face into what's supposed to be fearful looks, but shows up only as bad acting.  I laughed.  LOVE the rugged look he has though.  The beard looks great and I'm not a fan of facial hair.The thing that bugged me about this the most, was small odd scenes that were shot, and then all tossed around and edited together like a bunch of high school kids were working on a film project in their cinema class.  You knew which scenes were staged so the actors would stand and stare at the CGI to be inserted later.  LolThe super storm threatens Van Dien and his on screen family, so they decide to head to higher ground in the family car (Approx 21 mins into the movie).  Once there, the snarky son gets out of the car complaining and kicking up dirt, until the mom say's ""John, be quiet"".Then, dad say's ""I hear it too"". Then, they all scramble, per verbal instruction, to get into the car ""slowly"" then ""faster"" without the film EVER explaining WHAT the stupid scary sound was.  lol....  Bigfoot perhaps? Mountain Lions? Zombies? Vampires?  Wait, it's daylight so no it couldn't be vamps...(Eh, unless it's a glittery Cullen}.The entire scene is about 20 seconds long and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
