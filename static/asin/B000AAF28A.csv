The humor is ethnic but done in fun, and the audience has many ethnic people laughing at themselves and the racial stereotypes she is saying.  Sex is also a big part of her act.  People that have never heard Lisa usually go nuts, they cant believe what they are hearing while they are rolling on the floor laughing.  I have seen her in person a few times, and this dvd captures the essense of a real good show.

Mesa,"[5, 6]","Ahhh, the kind of sweet gal to take home to meet dear ol' mum!...She's been described as bawdy,brash, and irreverent; and that's just my mother.God bless her.Wait until she meets Lisa!...This is the most hysterical female comic on the planet ! Lisa is the gal that would be cool to hang out with the guys at the bar and really have a wild time at karaoke night. Her humor is definitley not for the sensitive,squeamish, meek & mild, faint of heart, etc. etc. I'll tell you who she is for though; People who want to laugh and can appreciate adult raunchy humor at it's hysterical, almost-wet-your-pants best ! She's on the ball and has that gifted knack for quick snappy comebacks, great pacing or timing;the jokes and lines just fly at an alarming speed and are aplenty! She doesn't miss a beat at all.She's an equal opportunity gal and won't leave anybody out from the audience. Gives everybody a fair shake.You will even catch Lisa Lampanelli snickering and snorting or chortling to her own jokes or observations (trying to stifle her own laughter);that's cause she KNOWS her material is awesome! I highly recommend this for the open minded and for those who want to just have a great time sharing this with friends (of the same humor, that is) ! ...BTW, even if this is or isn't available on audio cd, you have to watch the dvd format to really appreciate the hilarious facial expressions/ character contortions,body movements,ethnic accents this woman creates when she's really into her routine. Just for her expressions is worth the price of admisson alone !",5,You're Smokin' Hot L.L. !!!,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,1562,"['Ahhh', 'kind', 'sweet', 'gal', 'take', 'home', 'meet', 'dear', 'ol', 'mum', 'been', 'described', 'bawdy', 'brash', 'irreverent', 'just', 'mother.God', 'bless', 'her.Wait', 'Lisa', 'most', 'hysterical', 'female', 'comic', 'planet', 'Lisa', 'gal', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'hang', 'out', 'guys', 'bar', 'really', 'have', 'wild', 'time', 'karaoke', 'night', 'humor', 'definitley', 'not', 'sensitive', 'squeamish', 'meek', 'mild', 'faint', 'heart', 'etc', 'etc', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'who', 'People', 'who', 'want', 'laugh', 'can', 'appreciate', 'adult', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'hysterical', 'almost-wet-your-pants', 'best', 'ball', 'gifted', 'knack', 'quick', 'snappy', 'comebacks', 'great', 'pacing', 'timing', 'jokes', 'lines', 'just', 'fly', 'alarming', 'speed', 'are', 'aplenty', ""n't"", 'miss', 'beat', 'all.She', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'gal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'anybody', 'audience', 'everybody', 'fair', 'shake.You', 'will', 'even', 'catch', 'Lisa', 'Lampanelli', 'snickering', 'snorting', 'chortling', 'own', 'jokes', 'observations', 'trying', 'stifle', 'own', 'laughter', 'cause', 'KNOWS', 'material', 'awesome', 'highly', 'recommend', 'open', 'minded', 'who', 'want', 'just', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'sharing', 'friends', 'same', 'humor', 'BTW', 'even', ""n't"", 'available', 'audio', 'cd', 'have', 'watch', 'dvd', 'format', 'really', 'appreciate', 'hilarious', 'facial', 'expressions/', 'character', 'contortions', 'body', 'movements', 'ethnic', 'accents', 'woman', 'when', 'really', 'routine', 'Just', 'expressions', 'price', 'admisson', 'alone']",Take It Like A Man

We get Leno here on MNBC - a few days after the actual broadcast. I thought she was hilarious and immediately ordered both her shows. I watched this one first and loved it. If you like humour and stand-up, this is DEFINITELY a DVD to add to your collection. BUT. There is a big fat BUT. Don't buy her other show on DVD, even if you love this one. It is called ""The Queen of Mean"", and the audio and visual standards are pathetic and amateurish! I am not making this up or trying to be harsh - but it looks like a pirated copy from China. And the saddest thing was that she did almost the EXACT same material in that show as she did in this show. Hence 4 stars and not 5. A lot of the things I laughed at on LENO also resurfaced in this act. Quite ironic that the word IMPROV is clearly visible above the stage through most of the show.

Lisa Lampanelli -- the proclaimed ""Queen Of Mean"" -- keeps the jokes running at break-neck speed, with all of them being hilarious. Just be warned, she doesn't get the nickname for nothing. Amazon.com shows this DVD as rated PG. I have suspicions that is false information. There is plenty of adult language to go around, and the subject of most of her material is very racy for children. Not only is ""Take It Like A Man"" extremely questionable for young viewers, but undeniably questionable for the easily-offended. She has a great sense of humor, and the majority of it revolves around making fun of certain types of people. As her saying goes, ""It is fun to make fun of everybody"". She shoves it to white people, black people, gay people, hispanic people, christians, muslims, jews, and much more. If you are at all proud of who you are and can't take a joke, avoid Lisa Lampanelli! This is raw, mean humor, intended to bring us together by laughing at ourselves. A fine job she does at that.
