1036714,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000KZRP12,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[36, 40]","Ariellah is a petite dynamo who in her ""Welcome"" on this excellent DVD tells how yoga and belly dance can be related, and how yoga helps one to do the  isolations, which Ariellah teaches in slow motion and with exact precision in her Technique Drills. She says that yoga also brings strength and energy, and heightened awareness that can be applied to belly dancing. All the yoga and bellydancing is done slowly on this DVD, and gives the impression that it is easier than it actually is, though even if you are a beginner, and you listen to your body and only do as much as you can, you will find the exercises and drills challenging and rewarding.The DVD is well produced and takes place on a bare stage setting that is a good contrast to Ariellah's black leotards, making it easy to see each movement; you have the choice of a Short or Full yoga warm-up (the ""Full"" isn't necessarily harder, it is just longer and has a different selection of movements) and there is also a wonderful ""Yoga Cool Down"" at the very end. After the Drills there is Choreography to learn, and then Combination Practice, repeated so you can practice until perfect. Best of all perhaps are the performances, With Ariellah in her unique and fantastic costumes, spellbinding with her incredible agility and technique in 3 aesthetically beautiful numbers.Whether you just want to have a terrific yoga workout, or learn the basics of bellydance isolation taught by a master, or get the best of both worlds, Ariellah's Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga Conditioning is 150 minutes of a winning combination and a great addition to anyone's dance instruction DVD library.",5,The Best of 2 Worlds,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,1643,"['Ariellah', 'petite', 'dynamo', 'who', 'Welcome', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'how', 'yoga', 'belly', 'dance', 'can', 'be', 'related', 'how', 'yoga', 'one', 'do', 'isolations', 'Ariellah', 'teaches', 'slow', 'motion', 'exact', 'precision', 'Technique', 'Drills', 'yoga', 'also', 'strength', 'energy', 'heightened', 'awareness', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'belly', 'dancing', 'yoga', 'bellydancing', 'done', 'slowly', 'DVD', 'impression', 'easier', 'actually', 'though', 'even', 'are', 'beginner', 'listen', 'body', 'only', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'will', 'find', 'exercises', 'drills', 'challenging', 'rewarding.The', 'DVD', 'well', 'produced', 'place', 'bare', 'stage', 'setting', 'good', 'contrast', 'Ariellah', 'black', 'leotards', 'making', 'easy', 'see', 'movement', 'have', 'choice', 'Short', 'Full', 'warm-up', 'Full', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'harder', 'just', 'longer', 'different', 'selection', 'movements', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Yoga', 'Cool', 'Down', 'very', 'end', 'Drills', 'Choreography', 'learn', 'then', 'Combination', 'Practice', 'repeated', 'can', 'practice', 'perfect', 'Best', 'perhaps', 'are', 'performances', 'Ariellah', 'unique', 'fantastic', 'costumes', 'spellbinding', 'incredible', 'agility', 'technique', '3', 'aesthetically', 'beautiful', 'numbers.Whether', 'just', 'want', 'have', 'terrific', 'yoga', 'workout', 'learn', 'basics', 'bellydance', 'isolation', 'taught', 'master', 'get', 'best', 'worlds', 'Ariellah', 'Contemporary', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Yoga', 'Conditioning', '150', 'minutes', 'winning', 'combination', 'great', 'addition', 'anyone', 'dance', 'instruction', 'DVD', 'library']","Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga, with Ariellah: Tribal fusion bellydance classes, Belly dance fitness, workout, and yoga instruction, Beginner-intermediate"

The drills - she did a movement - told you why it is important to do it properly - then repeated the movement over and over.  2.  Her dance performances at the end of the video are inspirational. Her choreography was fabulous and her movements were in sync with the music.  3.  The music that accompanies the instruction introduced me to a new genre of music.

1036716,A1ZYA1450LWBXF,B000KZRP12,Amazon Customer,"[64, 67]","I'm as impressed as everyone who's reviewed this video before me. Being unable to resist belly dance videos (and having only those for instruction) I've ended up collecting a shocking number of them. Of these, at least 90 percent must be belly dance isolations. So you wouldn't think I needed any more. Well think again.I immediately loved Ariellah's two fantastic drills -adding up to 75 minutes of hard work. I haven't managed 75 at a go yet but am notching up to about 40 minutes so far. That's separate from all the yoga. Ariellah has selected yoga poses and very thoughtfully, there's a short session for those who are not yoga-familiar and a longer one for those who are.There are no distractions during these drills. Nothing comes in the way. Not the music, not too much talking - nothing. It's an intuitively put together set of drills in which she gives tips I haven't found anywhere else in all my videos and reminders on posture and breathing. Her timing with these is impeccable. Just when I find I'm getting tired, she says ""Go on for a bit longer"" . That comes from being very well tuned into what her dance students must feel.Ariellah is all about control right down to the micromovement. If you've seen her elsewhere, you'll know that the seems to take the music, reroute it right through her body, and by the time it reaches you, you're seeing the music as well as hearing it. Her drills begin to give you the foundation for that control In just a few sessions I've found a visible difference with the sharpness of my hip and rib cage movements. The arms? A long way to go for me but I'm relentlessly sticking to the especially solid arms section. All I can say is that I can finely shimmy one shoulder at a time now. Well, the right one, anyway.The combinations are versatile and for me, make a fantastic collection when combined with similar ones from other tribal fusion videos like East Coast Tribal and Tribal Fusion NYC. Also Bellydance for Beautiful Freaks.I also like a lot of the music on this video, though the lyrics of one or two are nothing to dance about. Something about a plane about to come down. I'm not so sure about that. But the most-used song, Stiga, by the group Lumin, is very sensual and addictive.",5,Control right down to the micro-movement with dance drills,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,2240,"[""'m"", 'as', 'impressed', 'everyone', 'who', 'reviewed', 'video', 'Being', 'unable', 'resist', 'belly', 'dance', 'videos', 'having', 'only', 'instruction', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'collecting', 'shocking', 'number', 'least', '90', 'percent', 'must', 'be', 'belly', 'dance', 'isolations', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'needed', 'more', 'Well', 'think', 'again.I', 'immediately', 'loved', 'Ariellah', 'two', 'fantastic', 'drills', '-adding', 'up', '75', 'minutes', 'hard', 'work', 'have', ""n't"", 'managed', '75', 'go', 'yet', 'am', 'notching', 'up', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'far', 'separate', 'yoga', 'Ariellah', 'selected', 'yoga', 'poses', 'very', 'thoughtfully', 'short', 'session', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'yoga-familiar', 'longer', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'distractions', 'drills', 'Nothing', 'way', 'Not', 'music', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'nothing', 'intuitively', 'put', 'together', 'set', 'drills', 'tips', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'anywhere', 'else', 'videos', 'reminders', 'posture', 'breathing', 'timing', 'impeccable', 'Just', 'when', 'find', ""'m"", 'getting', 'tired', 'Go', 'bit', 'longer', 'being', 'very', 'well', 'tuned', 'what', 'dance', 'students', 'must', 'feel.Ariellah', 'control', 'right', 'down', 'micromovement', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'elsewhere', ""'ll"", 'know', 'take', 'music', 'reroute', 'right', 'body', 'time', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'hearing', 'Her', 'begin', 'give', 'foundation', 'control', 'just', 'few', 'sessions', ""'ve"", 'found', 'visible', 'difference', 'sharpness', 'hip', 'rib', 'cage', 'movements', 'arms', 'long', 'way', 'go', ""'m"", 'relentlessly', 'sticking', 'especially', 'solid', 'arms', 'section', 'can', 'say', 'can', 'finely', 'shimmy', 'one', 'shoulder', 'time', 'now', 'Well', 'right', 'one', 'anyway.The', 'combinations', 'are', 'versatile', 'make', 'fantastic', 'collection', 'when', 'combined', 'similar', 'ones', 'other', 'tribal', 'fusion', 'videos', 'East', 'Coast', 'Tribal', 'Tribal', 'Fusion', 'NYC', 'Also', 'Bellydance', 'Beautiful', 'Freaks.I', 'also', 'lot', 'music', 'video', 'lyrics', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'nothing', 'dance', 'about', 'Something', 'plane', 'come', 'down', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'most-used', 'song', 'Stiga', 'group', 'Lumin', 'very', 'sensual', 'addictive']","Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga, with Ariellah: Tribal fusion bellydance classes, Belly dance fitness, workout, and yoga instruction, Beginner-intermediate"

I also started taking lessons from a very traditional teacher.  I fell in love with Ariellah, off of utube, when I seen her dance.  It is mesmerizing.  I promply bought this video.  Well I started practicing with her.  Even though I am a beginner, it was totally doable.  I also bought Rachel Brices, Serpentine.  That was to hard for me.  I'm saving it for when I improve.  But Ariellah on the other hand, I dug right into and was able to keep up through most of it.  It is a really good workout, with lots of wonderful drills.  I took a few of my new found skills to class with me though, and promply got in trouble, as they are not traditional.  Even though I feel a little old for this style, I love the music, the dance, and some of the look of the tribal style.  Even though I have to keep it a secret from  my teacher).

1036723,A3U0EHTZ8OP4NO,B000KZRP12,Helena Li,"[0, 0]","My DVD ""BellyDance and yoga conditioning"" by Ariellah has arrived!I was so impressed! I have many similar DVDs already and I know many different isolations already. But Adriellah is able to help me perfect them as well as teaching something new. No doubt, she is 1st class but many teachers are 1st class too. Yet, they somehow tend to think we are not so smart so they teach us some not so smart moves. If they dance gracefully, they teach us to move in a similar way but not exactly the same. e.g. snake arms; I never knew I have to turn the shoulder forward before the lifting of shoulder, then elbow and wrist, no wonder they look much better than me! Now I know the secret and Adriellah is not miserly to hide her secret from me. She is the only teacher who teaches me this turning forward... Also shimmy, I never knew you have to move the glute rather than the knees. No wonder! From Amazon.net, most customers give her a 5 star comment on this DVD; and I will do the same! She is very good at her subject and she is able to teach! This is the 5 star standard of any person who takes up teaching as a post.Adriellah thinks we can all dance well. So she breaks the move into bits and starts from scratch. Once we master it, she adds a bit more and a bit more. In the end, I can do as well as she or nearly. The tone is right, the music excellent, the lighting perfect. I have bought one by Blanca. She is also an excellent dancer but in the tutorial section, it frightens me. Behind her, the background has been whitened.It is not natural, it is by way of editing, I believe. In the end, the white light blinds me! How can I do the tutorials? (Other than that, the rest is perfect. But this little thing has killed my whole perception of her very good teaching.)Ariellah has a pefect body, not a big bust body like many belly dancers have but it is superb too, the kind of body well toned. This DVD has become my favourite and I am practising her moves day and night whenever I have some spare time (until replaced another one later). After a couple of days with her practices, my whole ab has been so well toned that I can see a round shape of my waist (as a lot of work by the obligues) instead of a sheet shape and it looks very much better! Yes, her DVD has instilled a lot of confidence in me! Not to mention I can follow her yoga practice to stretch the body, my another favourite subject!

I personally don't care too much for her modern goth music.  I prefer to dance to more traditional sounds, but her music is unoffensive and fairly easy to ignore.Let's face it, the only way to really get a move down well is to practice.  This DVD is all about practice.  Ariella drills each move for a couple minutes, giving you plenty of time to explore and improve.  She adds some variations and level changes to keep you challenged, and there are 2 different drill sections.  The moves are well explained, and she seems to know when my posture is slipping and gives me a nice reminder.There are 2 yoga warm ups, short and long.  If yoga isn't your thing don't worry, there is plenty of other content on this DVD.  Just be sure to do some other warm up and stretch before you begin.  Personally, I liked her yoga warm ups, but I tend to use the short one so I have more time to practice dance.I like her choreography, and she explains it clearly.  She then performs the choreo to 2 different songs to show it's versatility.  This is good for those who don't like her music, you can pick the least offensive song.I liked her performances at the end, even if I'm not a fan of the music.  (I actually like one of the songs she performs to.)  If you don't like goth, then I doubt you'll like her outfits, but again, there is a lot of other content on this DVD.  I borrow what I like and ignore the rest.Ariella is a VERY skilled dancer.  Her moves are crisp and clean.  I can always tell what move she is doing.  She doesn't wiggle, she dances.  Practice with this DVD has improved my control and endurance.For those who do like goth, I recommend this over the other goth belly dance DVDs.  Ariella does a better job of explaining the moves, and then adding variations and layers.  She gives you time to explore and absorb a move before going to another one.  She drills with precision, and teaches you how to achieve it.  She practices in plain clothes and you can always see her feet.  Her choreos show you how to put it all together.If you really want clean moves, then this is the DVD for you.",5,Excellent Instruction for Precision Dance,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,2218,"['DVD', 'excellent', 'improving', 'technique', 'IF', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'music', 'IF', 'like', 'drill.I', 'really', 'DVD', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'modern', 'goth', 'music', 'prefer', 'dance', 'more', 'traditional', 'sounds', 'music', 'unoffensive', 'fairly', 'easy', 'ignore.Let', 'face', 'only', 'way', 'really', 'get', 'move', 'down', 'well', 'practice', 'DVD', 'practice', 'Ariella', 'move', 'couple', 'minutes', 'giving', 'time', 'explore', 'improve', 'variations', 'level', 'changes', 'keep', 'challenged', 'are', '2', 'different', 'drill', 'sections', 'moves', 'are', 'well', 'explained', 'know', 'when', 'posture', 'slipping', 'nice', 'reminder.There', 'are', '2', 'yoga', 'warm', 'ups', 'short', 'long', 'yoga', ""n't"", 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'plenty', 'other', 'content', 'DVD', 'Just', 'be', 'sure', 'do', 'other', 'warm', 'stretch', 'begin', 'Personally', 'liked', 'yoga', 'warm', 'ups', 'tend', 'use', 'short', 'one', 'so', 'have', 'more', 'time', 'practice', 'dance.I', 'choreography', 'clearly', 'then', 'choreo', '2', 'different', 'songs', 'show', 'versatility', 'good', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'music', 'can', 'pick', 'least', 'offensive', 'song.I', 'liked', 'performances', 'end', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'music', 'actually', 'one', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'goth', 'then', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'like', 'outfits', 'again', 'lot', 'other', 'content', 'DVD', 'borrow', 'what', 'like', 'ignore', 'rest.Ariella', 'VERY', 'skilled', 'dancer', 'moves', 'are', 'crisp', 'clean', 'can', 'always', 'tell', 'what', 'move', 'doing', ""n't"", 'wiggle', 'Practice', 'DVD', 'improved', 'control', 'endurance.For', 'who', 'do', 'goth', 'recommend', 'other', 'goth', 'belly', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'Ariella', 'better', 'job', 'explaining', 'moves', 'then', 'adding', 'variations', 'layers', 'time', 'explore', 'absorb', 'move', 'before', 'going', 'one', 'precision', 'teaches', 'how', 'achieve', 'practices', 'plain', 'clothes', 'can', 'always', 'see', 'feet', 'choreos', 'show', 'how', 'put', 'together.If', 'really', 'want', 'clean', 'moves', 'then', 'DVD']","Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga, with Ariellah: Tribal fusion bellydance classes, Belly dance fitness, workout, and yoga instruction, Beginner-intermediate"

Ariellah does a great job explaining proper mechanics for each movement.  You will really understand the movement and how to use your body.  The downside is that if you already know movement mechanics ... you will be crying from boredom.This DVD is by no means dumbed-down just b/c it is best for beginners.  If you can follow to the end, you will learn some advanced movement and choreography.  As an advanced dancer, I have to do something else while practicing with this DVD.  Drill a move, then wash a few dishes while she explains body mechanics I already know, tear off the rubber gloves and run back to the computer to drill the move I don't alrady know, repeat.  So I work-out and get the house clean at the same time.A better menu to ""cherry-pick"" the advanced moves from the beginner explanations and body-mechanics drills would have made this 5 stars.This DVD is great to learn body mechanics.

I had watched the previews for it on Youtube and I'm quite happy that the dvd is everything I expected it to be. Ariellah is a very calm person, I enjoy trying to perform the movements and she is very good at starting slowly to make sure you have a better understanding of the movements. Her explanations are simple but effective, however I do have one criticism. As a true beginner to belly dance and to yoga, I really wish she would have offered a section that explained the yoga movements before doing them. This is the main reason I subtracted a star, because while I can see the movements and somewhat understand them, I had to watch the dvd several times to see how she does the yoga poses before I could just follow along and begin to mimic them. Otherwise, this is actually a very relaxing dvd to learn Belly dancing from or to use for the yoga section.

1036732,ANJ3LGT9SKJKM,B000KZRP12,Panda fitness,"[0, 0]","WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:+ Technical tips for achieving beautiful moves during the drilling sections. I have been thinking why the movement looks so good when practised with Ariellah and it's not just the tips: she first lets you drill intensely what I call now a ""muscle opener"" (a simple move to increase your range of motion) and then introduces the more complex drill, like a hip sway before hip figure 8's, etc.+ Beautiful slow drills+ Snake arm session that will help you achieve the most graceful arm undulations (best in my collection)+ Drilling for your obliques and lower abs. In all BD DVD's they tell you to use your obliques for mayas and taxseem (vertical hip figure 8's), but they just tell you that with practice you'll get better and don't tell you how to do it. While doing horizontal hip sways Ariellah asks you not to shift your weight completely (as opposed to what more oriental dancers ask you to do). In order not to shift your weight completely you need to engage your abs more thoroughly, this is how you really train them for takseems and mayas. So if you follow Ariellah's instructions carefully, your practice will be ""perfect practice"" and you'll learn how to use your obliques.+ One of the best ""only upper body"" undulations in my collection. The undulations done by Ariellah and most tribal bellydancers are different than the ones taught by Neon in her DVD'sLove Potion: The Bellydance Workout, with Neon: Belly dance fitness class, Beginner belly dance instruction, which are full body undulations; so pick your choice, both are excellent teachers.+ Music selection (see below)+ Excellent for advanced beginners and to ""grow"" with it slowlyThe achievement of beautiful movement through excellent technique shows you Ariellah's extensive ballet background. During the vertical figure 8's up-to-down (mayas) and down-to-up (taxseem) drills, Ariellah gives a few tips regarding tucking the pelvis and weight placement that definitely helped mine looked much much better and effortless in just one session! While doing snake arms she tells you to concentrate your effort in your upper arms, so that your hands are freed and can look beautiful. I paid $10 for my DVD and for the improvement I got from following her tips and cues, this was a bargain. These drills are useful for all bellydance genres, so if you like Egyptian or Cabaret but are scared away by the ""gothic"" look; believe me, she drills beautiful slow movement and combines movements with a wide range of motion with smaller and quicker movements, so you will certainly benefit from this DVD, specially if you have no real life teacher to correct you. The only complaint I have is the ""mirror-problem"". I rarely have a problem with it. I think I just look at what they do and ""copy"" it in the same direction that I see the movement, ignoring what the say. The problem here is that Ariellah is continuosly saying ""right"" or ""left"", but too often, so it can really get me out of synch when I am trying just to follow what I see.Regarding drills I ownModern Tribal Belly Dance, with Asharah: Beginner tribal fusion bellydance how-to, Belly dancing instructionandSerpentine: Bellydance with Rachel Brice (TWO-DVD SET): Complete belly dancing instructional program, Belly dancing classes with yoga, How-to in Rachel's tribal style belly dance, including full choreographies(best layered shimmy section I own). Personally I think Asharah's drills (and her tough conditioning section) helped me improve very fast and when I used this DVD, both drill levels included seemed fairly easy with some exceptions. I am not quite sure that had I owned and drilled with Ariellah's DVD first, if Asharah's would have seemed easy; I do not think so. Asharah increases the tempo more and makes more ""punctuated"" and sharp moves. If I could only get one drilling DVD, I would probably get Asharah's (because you get more fitness benefits and muscle control from it, and my main goal when I started BD and other dance DVDs was to get some exercise but in a fun way). If your goal is beauty and artistry you might get more out of Ariellah's DVD. Better yet, purchase Ariellah's DVD first, so you learn and drill beautiful form from the beginning, then you can move up to Asharah's.Why 4 stars and not 5? I do not know! I have rated Asharah's DVD with 5 and I think I got more out of it, maybe this is an unfair rating...(P.D. Yes, this was unfair. After using this DVD more often, I think it is as useful as Asharah's but in a different way...)CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low TONING: Medium CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Advanced Beginner to Advanced Intermediate DRILLS: Very good for beginners, starts very slow and gradually increases the tempo and adds some relevees; easy in terms of layering INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent MUSIC: Excellent - Industrial (gothic), blends perfectly with the drills. FUN FACTOR: Medium - It's drilling, so it's not really for fun, but it is not boring either.CONTENT:1) Short yoga warm-up - Normally warm-up's are too short to be effective or too long to be used before your main routine, this one is of perfect length while still being effective.2) Long yoga warm-up - I think it is more a conditioning yoga segment than a warm-up and it's ok for that purpose. Ariellah, Elisheva and Fayzah are the only bellydancers that also do some exercises for your abs other tan bellydance moves. I really think this is necessary to improve your balance in order to be able to perform on releve.3) Drills Level 1 - All the drills in this DVD (levels 1 & 2) are explained carefully and first drilled at slow speed; there is almost no layering, so you drill each move independently to really do it with closed eyes4) Drills Level 2 - These are a bit more difficult and you will add upper arms movements to the hip drills5) Choreography breakdown - it is very clearly explained step by step. I have a hard time remembering more than two 8-counts, so I am probably not ready for full choreos. This choreography consists of six combinations each containing three 8-counts. This is the same length as other choreographies, only this one seems a bit easier, since it has less popping and no ticking, also less travelling, and fewer turns and arm movements. So regarding full choreos, maybe this one is the easiest you can get, but not the best looking though.6) Choreography practise - The same choreography is practised with two different songs, one faster than the other. This is an excellent idea, so you can improve your skills without needing to learn a different choreo and you can see how you can apply the same moves to different music.7) Performance by Ariellah8) Yoga Cool down. The cooldown is not really a cooldown and it's not really yoga. It has two or three very brief stretching yoga exercises and a couple of minutes of relaxation routine (like when you lie down for meditation).MUSIC: Industrial (gothic).  I need to say that I do not like listening to this type of music, but dancing to it is another story. It was fascinating!! The cadence and slow evocative lyrics helped me through the long drilling segment (normally I do not like slow music, I find it cheesy, but dancing to what sounds like a contemporary medieval church choir feels totally different, just delicious). The gothic lyrics are slow (ideal for sultry moves with mysterious and dark accents), but come together with industrial faster beats, so that you can easily increase your tempo during the drilling session. On top of this, Ariellah uses 2 or 3 different songs that match each drilling section so you do not get bored (same songs for both drilling levels).EMPHASIS:Perfecting your technique to obtain beautiful and dramatic moves, so a lot of drills and technique tips to make your moves look vibrant, full of emotion but at the same time effortless. It also emphasizes toning your abs (obliques and lower abs) with slow controlled movements.",4,Looking for improving the beauty of your moves?,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,7923,"['WHAT', 'BETTER',

1036736,A20BEJHG0X30QW,B000KZRP12,Ryky,"[2, 2]","This dvd works for me - I think it is a good workout and certainly worth the money. There is a lot of material, not something I can do all at once (please can we have a matrix? or long dvd's broken down into different workout lengths like yoga ones?)I've been reading through the other reviews so that I don't bother saying the same things. (Mala, you always give great reviews, thanks.) I will say that what I like most is the clear instruction on which muscles to isolate, and why.Some of the negative reviews say the drills are boring - well yes they are, but long drills build muscle memory and cleaner movements, which is why I need a dvd to keep me going and Ariellah does that...if you just want a dance workout get luscious or something like that.Another says the yoga isn't integrated into the bellydancing. The yoga, drills, combinations are all seperate sections. Yoga is of course wonderful for building strength, flexibility, calmness etc etc I'm not sure I understand why you need it 'integrated'. It's cross training! I am no yoga teacher though and don't feel qualified to comment on the quality of the yoga instruction. A few more stretches inbetween drills would be nice, but of course I am capable of pausing and doing that myself. (Or like I said at the start, sections broken down and remixed into a series of 30, 45 60 minute workout would be wonderful, but I don't deduct a star as none of the dance dvd's do that yet...). I think if you want yoga and dancing integrated then you need to look through the vinyasa flow dvd's. Dance the chakras has the yoga and dancing seperate aswell (and the dancing is not great!)And I think the one star review came from someone who couldn't bring themselves to watch the dvd because of the gothic feel - absolutely, if for some reason goth freaks you out, don't buy it! Although on a scale of gothic this really is quite mild in any case.Personally I like most of the music (except the beautiful piece for the second performance ends with a rather 'hellish' last phrase, but if you like the genre you won't care). Overall, I think Ariellah teaches well, it has a good mix of options (probably not for absolute beginners) and it is worth the price.",5,worth the money,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,2207,"['dvd', 'think', 'good', 'workout', 'certainly', 'money', 'lot', 'material', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'do', 'once', 'please', 'can', 'have', 'matrix', 'long', 'dvd', 'broken', 'down', 'different', 'lengths', 'yoga', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'saying', 'same', 'things', 'Mala', 'always', 'give', 'great', 'reviews', 'thanks', 'will', 'say', 'what', 'like', 'most', 'clear', 'instruction', 'muscles', 'isolate', 'why.Some', 'negative', 'reviews', 'say', 'drills', 'are', 'boring', 'well', 'are', 'long', 'drills', 'build', 'muscle', 'memory', 'cleaner', 'movements', 'why', 'need', 'dvd', 'keep', 'going', 'Ariellah', 'just', 'want', 'dance', 'workout', 'get', 'luscious', 'something', 'that.Another', 'yoga', ""n't"", 'integrated', 'bellydancing', 'yoga', 'drills', 'combinations', 'are', 'seperate', 'sections', 'Yoga', 'course', 'wonderful', 'building', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'calmness', 'etc', 'etc', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'understand', 'why', 'need', ""'integrated"", 'cross', 'training', 'am', 'yoga', 'teacher', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'qualified', 'comment', 'quality', 'yoga', 'instruction', 'few', 'more', 'stretches', 'inbetween', 'drills', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'course', 'am', 'capable', 'pausing', 'doing', 'said', 'start', 'sections', 'broken', 'down', 'remixed', 'series', '30', '45', '60', 'minute', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'do', ""n't"", 'deduct', 'star', 'none', 'dance', 'dvd', 'do', 'yet', 'think', 'want', 'yoga', 'dancing', 'integrated', 'then', 'need', 'look', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'dvd', 'Dance', 'chakras', 'yoga', 'dancing', 'seperate', 'aswell', 'dancing', 'not', 'great', 'think', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'came', 'someone', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'watch', 'dvd', 'gothic', 'feel', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'freaks', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'scale', 'gothic', 'really', 'quite', 'mild', 'case.Personally', 'like', 'most', 'music', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'second', 'performance', 'rather', ""'hellish"", 'last', 'phrase', 'like', 'genre', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'Overall', 'think', 'Ariellah', 'teaches', 'well', 'good', 'mix', 'options', 'probably', 'not', 'absolute', 'beginners', 'price']","Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga, with Ariellah: Tribal fusion bellydance classes, Belly dance fitness, workout, and yoga instruction, Beginner-intermediate"

Ariellah is down to business teaching her technique calmly and suredly. A great combination yoga and dance work out with the essential of belly dance exercising small controlled movements which especially work the abs. The Hip work is challenging as it sometimes executed on toe, and changing levels. Chest isolation drills are intense. Arm drills, are lengthy and detailed as to benefit the serious dancer to creating fluid movement.The setting is simple, the music is at times freaky but blends into her dark style which is alluring, mysterious and captivating. I have seen many tribal dancers execute their personal styles, sometimes straying too far from belly dance and creating a different fusion, Ariellah's moves are defintelty founded in the basics and embellished with her own personal style.

As it turns out, she can teach as well as perform, and she does both very well.There is definitely something for both new and experienced dancers alike on this DVD.  As has already been stated, there's 75 minutes of drills (not including the yoga) and about 45 minutes of choreography and performances.  The drills are actually broken up into two sections, the second being for more advanced students.  The choreography is also broken down into two sections, and she even goes over the counts (a godsend for someone like me who can't always get the moves ""in sync"" with the music without endless repetition).  Aside from getting my left and right messed up a few times (something I've always done), I actually felt that the choreographies were quite ""doable"" right off the bat (something I am not often able to say, as I'm one of those women who usually take weeks to get a choreographed dance down).I felt everything, from the selection of yoga poses to the music, were well thought out.  I think the thing that impressed me most was when she seemed to know when I was starting to make certain form mistakes (""make sure you aren't doing this with your neck"") and would have the viewers check with their bodies to make sure that they were still in proper dance posture several times.  Lastly, if you need motivation, just watch the performances at the end of the DVD.
