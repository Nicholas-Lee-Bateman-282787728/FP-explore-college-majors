773405,AD5JI9UN98JPH,B0000C3I8C,christmas lover,"[0, 0]",This is a good movie especially if you are a fan of Christmas movoies. Kelsey Grammer of Cheers and Frasier fame plays Santa Claus son whose time has come to take over the business and find a wife neither of which he wants to do. When he changes his mind about the latter he naturally makes the wrong choice-until the end of the movie. Speaking of which as the movie goes along he picks up Santas chacatoristics and realizes that like it or not he is Santa Claus.,5,Dont Call Me Santa,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,463,"['good', 'movie', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'Christmas', 'movoies', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'Cheers', 'Frasier', 'fame', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'son', 'time', 'come', 'take', 'over', 'business', 'find', 'wife', 'neither', 'do', 'When', 'mind', 'latter', 'naturally', 'wrong', 'choice-until', 'end', 'movie', 'Speaking', 'movie', 'up', 'Santas', 'chacatoristics', 'not', 'Santa', 'Claus']",N/A
