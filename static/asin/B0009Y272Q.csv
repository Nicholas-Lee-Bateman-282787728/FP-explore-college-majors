Now I am thinking of buying the first season, I would recommend this if you are like me, that means, if you know nothing about the tv show and its your first incursion with the series, this way you can see if you like it or not, otherwise I recommend you go directly for the seasons.On the other hand I have to say it is a very good show (a real one), but I am not so sure about ""the very best of""... because in some of the teasers about ""the next program"" I could tell that they looked more interesting than some of the shows included in this DVD, so that's why I am not sure if the title of the DVD makes justice to all its content...

For a ""best of"" volume, I expected much shorter segments from many more episodes that actually did contain what the DVD case advertises, namely ""the best of"" and the ""scariest moments.""  In my opinion, this volume fails to deliver what it promises.  I am definitely a fan of the series, and I know there are much better moments it has to offer.  About the only thing you can really expect to enjoy on this DVD are some fairly decent examples of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon).

916597,AC06F0LPHI1TW,B0009Y272Q,K Scheffler,"[5, 6]","This dvd purports to be the ""very best of"" this series, but it is anything but.  First off, the first fifteen minutes or so has little to do with in the way ghost hunting, rather ""introduces"" the various persons involved with TAPS and is in fact quite boring.  I couldn't care less that these guys are plumbers and have wives that are pissed off with their preoccupation with the paranormal.  When we finally get around to the various investigations they turn out to be quite mundane and at times frustrating to watch because of the apparent amateurishness of the investigators.  If these guys have been doing this for as long as they claim, it certainly doesn't seem like it.  And in the end, despite the claim in the blurb on the gack of the dvd case that watching these episodes would convince one that ghosts really do exist, they certainly don't.  Sadly, the two episodes that seemed somewhat promising are not included in the dvd, although they are mentioned briefly in the ""in the next episode"" segment of two of the episodes.  What's more, in the five minute bonus feature in which two of the investigators discuss their favorite episodes, both the lighthouse and penitentiary investigations are agree upon as being favorites, while--if I remember correctly--only two of the fore included in this video are mentioned, and not with much enthusiasm.
