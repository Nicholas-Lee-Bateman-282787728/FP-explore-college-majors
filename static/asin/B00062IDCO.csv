856214,A2HB94R8GCXCVN,B00062IDCO,Amadeus 888,"[10, 19]","The episodes and other details have been covered elsewhere. I would just like to point out a few things:I'm a huge fan of this series and the previous ones with the exception of DS9, which is plain boring. I love ST Voyager, the first 4 seasons were fantastic, but... enough is enough. I'm sick and tired of the producers' political correctness and pedantry. How many times do we need to hear about ""humanity"", ""individuality"", ""holo-rights"" etc etc etc? These issues have been explored extensively both in the first 4-5 seasons of the series and in Star Trek:The Next Generation. Even in the 6th season, Janeway sacrificed the crew's privileges and their opportunity to communicate with their loved-ones at home just to let the Doctor with the inferiority complex to prove himself worthy of his ""holo-humanity"" once again.Also, Janeway's exaggerated ""compassion"" would probably make Jesus to freak out.They also made the mistake of over-showing the Borg. One of the reasons why the Borg were so succesful is because they were kept in the dark, full of evil power and mystery. Now, the Borg have become more common than humanity itself. The Borg Queen has lost her fatal and dark power. She's just another petty alien, trying to survive. Alas, Janeway won't let her. In this respect, Janeway's arrogance is unprecedented! Alice Krige was great (and so was Kate Mulgrew), but that is not enough to save the day.What happened? Did the producers get bored with their own creation? Because that's what it feels like. Knowing when to begin and when to stop is wisdom.All good things... in moderation, please. And remember, we still love Star Trek.",3,All good things...,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,1642,"['episodes', 'other', 'details', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'elsewhere', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'few', 'things', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'series', 'previous', 'ones', 'exception', 'DS9', 'plain', 'boring', 'love', 'ST', 'Voyager', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'were', 'fantastic', 'enough', 'enough', ""'m"", 'sick', 'tired', 'producers', 'political', 'correctness', 'pedantry', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'do', 'need', 'hear', 'humanity', 'individuality', 'holo-rights', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'issues', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'extensively', 'first', '4-5', 'seasons', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Even', '6th', 'season', 'Janeway', 'sacrificed', 'crew', 'privileges', 'opportunity', 'communicate', 'loved-ones', 'home', 'just', 'let', 'Doctor', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'prove', 'worthy', 'holo-humanity', 'once', 'again.Also', 'Janeway', 'exaggerated', 'compassion', 'would', 'probably', 'make', 'Jesus', 'freak', 'out.They', 'also', 'made', 'mistake', 'over-showing', 'Borg', 'One', 'reasons', 'why', 'Borg', 'were', 'so', 'succesful', 'were', 'kept', 'dark', 'full', 'evil', 'power', 'mystery', 'Now', 'Borg', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'common', 'humanity', 'Borg', 'Queen', 'lost', 'fatal', 'dark', 'power', 'just', 'petty', 'alien', 'trying', 'survive', 'Alas', 'Janeway', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'respect', 'Janeway', 'arrogance', 'unprecedented', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'was', 'great', 'so', 'was', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'day.What', 'happened', 'Did', 'producers', 'get', 'bored', 'own', 'creation', 'what', 'Knowing', 'when', 'begin', 'when', 'stop', 'wisdom.All', 'good', 'things', 'moderation', 'please', 'remember', 'still', 'love', 'Star', 'Trek']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Seventh Season
856215,A1HNOGVSUXQR51,B00062IDCO,"Amazon Customer ""Author""","[6, 8]","The rating is based on my personal feelings, and may not reflect stellar performances or impeccable writing. Still, as a stew of actors, writing, premise, and imagination, this was a brilliant series that was over, in my opinion, long before it's time.It is a sad ending with what I felt was too short a finale. Personally, I was hoping for a season 8, 9, and 10, but then we might have been treated to a bunch of Stargate SG-1-esque final chapters. No thank you! (Shame on you Ben Browder and Claudia Black! You killed off Farscape, and then you had to kill SG1, too? Just kidding... or am I?)Perhaps this would have been a good place to end the Voyager series. The creators were leading up to it in several previous episodes; the regular communication with Star Fleet, the loss of key characters, the lack of major threats on the road ahead. Yes, we could have seen a return of the Borg, the Hirogen, the Vidiians, the Kazon, any of the other recurring threats, or even a new threat with similar tactics.The problem was that, like Harry said when asked why he was still such a low rank for a bridge officer, ""It's a small ship. There are only so many positions available."" I think this rang true with the characters, there was little more you could do with them that did not threaten to deviate from their most endearing qualities. Perhaps they went out when fans still thought of them as interesting, and not old folks stuffed into uniforms bursting at the seams, their knees rickety and their actions stiff.Then again, I miss the characters and wish that some attempt at a collaboration would have ensued. A Star Trek movie doesn't always have to be based on a ship called Enterprise. I remember quite a few movies where the Enterprise was merely a footnote or a McGuffin for the chase.I enjoyed the Voyager cast's performances and thought they executed their roles well. Still, this show had problems. For one thing, I thought the writers or directors had some sort of difficulty in dealing with the characters and popularity. Kes, and her actor, Jennifer Lien, should not have been let go just to bring on Jeri Ryan's Seven of Nine. The problem was that the role both characters filled was the fish-out-of-water mentor-needing alien who would help to highlight Captain Janeway's wisdom and her human fallibility. What to do with Kes if Seven suddenly has all those lines? It's not like Kes was appearing in every episode. It seemed the show's creators were loathe to use her, but were contractually obligated to do so. They would haul her out to do make some obscure reference, ask a critical question, or give the other characters a much-needed nudge in the right direction, and then shove her back in the closet.In the end of the franchise, however, it seemed that Star Trek had a case of ""boobie fever"". I think Jeri Ryan is an exceptional actor, and if her singing was real, vocalist as well. However, I don't think any of that got her a job. She had two great references up front, and one ""behind"" her. Star Trek: DS9 did the same thing, and it always seems to come when the writing becomes the weakest.One last gripe from me was a true ""Where are they now?"" epilogue of events. Did the Maquis crew members find absolution on Earth? Did Seven of Nine run off, shave her hair, don an orange toga and become a Buddhist? Did Janeway take her new beau to a red carpet movie premier and make her old fiance jealous? Did Tuvok take up tennis, or the Doctor insight a holo-revolution?THAT could have been the movie right THERE! The Doc meets up with his mining dopple-gangers and finds an eager audience, at first. But then, the holo-slaves (Note- Why didn't Janeway use Commander Data's battle for recognized sentience as a precedent in the Doctor's case?)decide to spread out and take out posts all over the Neutral Zone, go back in time, rob Tuvok of his Katra, which would be installed in Lt. Paris, B'ellana's babe, Kuvah'magh, could be left on a planet experiencing hyper-evolution and become an instant adult, go back to the M-class planet and become the emperor of the New Klingon Empire, Delta Quadrant Division. Janeway can get assimilated again, become Kathcutus of Borg, lead an assault of the Gamma Quadrant against the remnants of the Dominion and its Founders, and Captain Sisko can provide the McGuffin or Deus Ex Machina that will save the day. Moral of the story, don't give up the writing ghost. There's lots of stuff that can still be done, and it doesn't all have to be wiped out by that modern Star Trek reboot's time-screw debacle.Star Trek: Voyager, we miss you. We hope you come back in some form, but if not, at least we have these episodes to keep us entertained.",5,A sad ending...,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,4694,"['rating', 'based', 'personal',

856219,A1M9H7AB2N0Q4Z,B00062IDCO,Andrew Cross,"[0, 0]","`Inside Man' doesn't feel like an episode of Voyager. It comes across more as a lesser episode of `TNG', which is odd, because I find Reg Barclay episodes to be pretty good.A hologram of Barclay (created by Barclay) is hijacked by some Ferengi, sent to Voyager, charms the pants off the crew, and presents them with a plan to get home that involves diving into stars. The Ferengi want Seven of Nine's probes, as they're worth mad profit. Barclay soon starts to realize something is up with his hologram, calls up Troi for help, and tries to figure out what's happening.The Voyager crew is a non-factor throughout the episode. They're basically in it to swoon over Holo-Reg, as a kind of reversal of Reg's usual outgoing confidence when interacting with holograms, but with him now being the fake one. It's territory we've seen multiple times already, as it comes across as total retread.The real plot is back in the Alpha quadrant, as Barclay, Troi, and Starfleet try to thwart the Ferengi from sending Voyager on a death flight. It's nice to see some of the classic gang and that's all it is - seeing some old buds. `Inside Man' could never have been made and we wouldn't have lost anything.Positive Points- Hanging around with Reg and Troi again is always nice. Also, seeing Richard McGonagle (of the `Uncharted' trilogy) is cool too.Negative Points- A regression from the strides Barclay took forward in the previous Voyager episode `Pathfinder.' So, all of the confidence and successes Reg got in that episode was dropped and we're back to this?

856230,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00062IDCO,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[3, 7]","Nominated for 30 Emmys, including seven for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series, Star Trek: Voyager continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before...Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live in the shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home...The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 7) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Unimatrix Zero"" in which Seven Of Nine discovers a place known as Unimatrix Zero, where Borg drones become individuals for a short period during their regeneration. However, once the regeneration process is complete, the drones forget all memory of the event. Capt. Janeway views this revelation as an opportunity to attack the Borg, and the Voyager must execute the plan perfectly if it is to succeed... Other notable episodes from Season 7 include ""Nightingale"" in which Harry Kim, Seven Of Nine, and Neelix stumble across a war between two alien nations while scavenging for dilithium, and ""Friendship One"" in which, having established regular contact with Alpha Quadrant, the Voyager receives orders from Starfleet to hunt down the lost 21st Century Earth probe, Friendship One...Below

856233,AMA6SPA2A43JH,B00062IDCO,Cassie,"[1, 1]","I own this season and I love it, but there are a few storylines I don't like. I had been waiting for a wedding ceremony for Tom and B'Elanna from the start. I was cheated out of seeing them get married in a ceremony. No, ""Course Oblivion"" doesn't count because it wasn't the real Tom and B'Elanna. I didn't like some of the aspects of the ""Endgame"". At the reunion it seemed as if ""Harry"" and the ""Doctor"" wrote it. It was all from their fantasies. C'mon now, no flesh and blood woman ia going to marry a hologram. Tom who did the most to get them home was portrayed as a clown. The writers should have shown him some respect. He was Chief Pilot, Chief Medic,He designed the Delta flyer, He put his life in danger in so many instances to save the crew. From the beginning when he saved Chakotay's life by getting him off that rickety staircase just before it dropped into an endless pit. He went undercover with the Kazon, He got the ship back after it was taken by the Kazon and saved the crew from having to spend the rest of their lives on that baren volcanic planet by flying through weapons fire. He broke the warp barrier. He trained with the Doctor even though he hated it for the sake of the crew. As far as I'm concerned Tom Paris was Voyager's hero. What did Harry do to compare? Nothing. Harry was Captain Janeway's pet from the beginning. She gave him privelegeshe didn't earn. She started training Harry to take her place as Captain even though he wasn't captain material. In ""Nightingale"" he got involved with aliens and snuck them back to Voyager without asking the real Captain's permission. Harry involved himself and the crew in a conflict between warring species, he risked bringing Voyager into that war. He risked wiping out the crew with an alien disease because of his hormones  in ""The Disease"" and all he got was a slap on the wrist. He wasn't punished in any way because he was the Captain's pet. On the other hand Tom who was trying to saved a ""planet"" from destruction was too severely punished. It should have been one or the other, either demoted or brig, not both.For risking wiping out the crew Harry diserved both, but got neither. I believe Seven had more to do with designing Astrometrics than Harry. C'Mon, Seven had technologies from who knows how many different alien worlds. Tom is the one who should have been shown in a great light in ""Endgame"", not Harry. At the end I would have liked to have seen the Paris family: Tom, B'Elanna, and baby together, not B'Elanna, baby, and the Doctor. Oh, and speaking of the baby, who in their right mind is going to make a hologram a godfather to a flesh and blood baby. B'Elanna only did that because she felt guilty for reprogramming him. She refused men godfathership because she claimed they weren't qualified, but the Doctor wasn't any more qualified. I only hope they changed that once they got back. Oh, and by the way. I have a theory of what that waterworld planet was. I think it was meant to house that creature. I think it was like a huge aquarium. That creature might of meant a lot to the species who built it and wanted to give it a proper home.",4,Season 7 storyline mistakes,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,3139,"['own', 'season', 'love', 'are', 'few', 'storylines', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'Tom', ""B'Elanna"", 'start', 'was', 'cheated', 'seeing', 'get', 'married', 'ceremony', 'No', 'Course', 'Oblivion', ""n't"", 'count', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'Tom', ""B'Elanna"", 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'aspects', 'Endgame', 'reunion', 'seemed', 'Harry', 'Doctor', 'wrote', 'was', 'fantasies', ""C'mon"", 'now', 'flesh', 'blood', 'woman', 'going', 'marry', 'hologram', 'Tom', 'who', 'did', 'most', 'get', 'home', 'was', 'portrayed', 'clown', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'shown', 'respect', 'was', 'Chief', 'Pilot', 'Chief', 'Medic', 'designed', 'Delta', 'flyer', 'put', 'life', 'danger', 'so', 'many', 'instances', 'save', 'crew', 'beginning', 'when', 'saved', 'Chakotay', 'life', 'getting', 'off', 'rickety', 'staircase', 'just', 'dropped', 'endless', 'pit', 'went', 'undercover', 'Kazon', 'got', 'ship', 'back', 'was', 'taken', 'Kazon', 'saved', 'crew', 'having', 'spend', 'rest', 'lives', 'baren', 'volcanic', 'planet', 'flying', 'weapons', 'fire', 'broke', 'warp', 'barrier', 'trained', 'Doctor', 'even', 'hated', 'sake', 'crew', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Tom', 'Paris', 'was', 'Voyager', 'hero', 'What', 'did', 'Harry', 'do', 'compare', 'Nothing', 'Harry', 'was', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'pet', 'beginning', 'gave', 'privelegeshe', 'did', ""n't"", 'earn', 'started', 'training', 'Harry', 'take', 'place', 'Captain', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'captain', 'material', 'Nightingale', 'got', 'involved', 'aliens', 'snuck', 'back', 'Voyager', 'asking', 'real', 'Captain', 'permission', 'Harry', 'involved', 'crew', 'conflict', 'warring', 'species', 'risked', 'bringing', 'Voyager', 'war', 'risked', 'wiping', 'out', 'crew', 'alien', 'disease', 'hormones', 'Disease', 'got', 'was', 'slap', 'wrist', 'was', ""n't"", 'punished', 'way', 'was', 'Captain', 'pet', 'other', 'hand', 'Tom', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'saved', 'planet', 'destruction', 'was', 'too', 'severely', 'punished', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'other', 'either', 'demoted', 'brig', 'not', 'risking', 'wiping', 'out', 'crew', 'Harry', 'diserved', 'got', 'believe', 'Seven', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'designing', 'Astrometrics', 'Harry', ""C'Mon"", 'Seven', 'had', 'technologies', 'who', 'how', 'many', 'different', 'alien', 'worlds', 'Tom', 'one', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'great', 'light', 'Endgame', 'not', 'Harry', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Paris', 'family', 'Tom', ""B'Elanna"", 'baby', 'together', 'not', ""B'Elanna"", 'baby', 'Doctor', 'Oh', 'speaking', 'baby', 'who', 'right', 'mind', 'going', 'make', 'hologram', 'godfather', 'flesh', 'blood', 'baby', ""B'Elanna"", 'only', 'did', 'felt', 'guilty', 'reprogramming', 'refused', 'men', 'godfathership', 'claimed', 'were', ""n't"", 'qualified', 'Doctor', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'qualified', 'only', 'hope', 'changed', 'once', 'got', 'back', 'Oh', 'way', 'have', 'theory', 'what', 'waterworld', 'planet', 'was', 'think', 'was', 'meant', 'house', 'creature', 'think', 'was', 'huge', 'aquarium', 'creature', 'might', 'meant', 'lot', 'species', 'who', 'built', 'wanted', 'give', 'proper', 'home']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Seventh Season

O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[19, 55]","While the last season was not great, it was an improvement, though the Chakotay/Seven of Nine love story was lame and really came from no where. Here was another stumbling block of the series. One has to wonder just how big Hirogen space is, because they bump into the again in the two-part Flesh and Blood (as the consequences of Janeway giving them the holodeck technology bites her in the ass). Like the Malon, who a made several appearances in the fifth season and were told their space is small (yet late in the season by the time Juggernaut aired, Voyager has jumped ten years closer to the Alpha Quadrant after the events of Dark Frontier), the return of the Hirogens is a head scratchier. True, we are told early on that the Hirogen have no real homeworld and they travel the comos, spread out like dandelions, but the odds of running into them -10,000 light years closer to Earth -was not realistic. I mean there was no way they could've run into the same Hirogen they gave the holodeck technology to in the first place. It just seemed they had this concept -Hologram Rights - so they hoped no one paid attention.  And while Shattered was a clip show, with out the actual clips unlike Relativity, it was another example of how desperate the show had become. As the series began to wind down, it began to tie up loose ends, as all but one of the Borgs kids were finally shuffled off. And while a Q episode is always worth waiting for, Q2 was a sorry story, as it looked like John de Lancie was tired of playing the role. And only God knows how he was able to get his own real life son, Keegan to play Q's son. But as the stories dried up, the show reverted back to predictable episodes. As an example, while it nice to finally get rid of the ever-annoying Neelix, his send off Homestead was very hackneyed. And then there was the Doctor's directionless holonovel thing. Desperation can breed bad stories, and Voyager seems to swim in its ocean. And while I had given up on the show way back in season 2, I had some dark hope the show would find its feet, but. Alas, it was not going to happen. The series ended with a remake of a previous episode, but is also probably Mulgrew's finest performance, at least as the silver-haired Admiral. Endgame opened 10 years after the crew of Voyager returned after spending 23 years in the Delta Quadrant. But all was not rosy, and an older, more cynical Admiral Janeway has decided to alter the outcome of what has happened. Like Timeless from the series fifth season, Janeway (like Harry was), is filled with regret at what has happened to her crew, especially Seven of Nine and Chakotay, who appeared to have died returning home. So she decides to change the rules and her future. Very politically incorrect and very ""cowboy diplomacy"" like. When all is said and done Endgame was a fine finale, if once again, unoriginal. There were some nice touches in this show, including Alice Krige's return as the Borg Queen and Kate Mulgrew's finest appearance as the older, bitter Janeway. Had she played Janeway like this through 7 seasons, I think the show could have been better. And while the ending was abrupt, it was in keeping with Trek's entire problem of rushing all its endings. Looking at the series as a whole, Michael Piller was able to see both its strengths and weaknesses. ""The whole idea of exploring space is a metaphor for exploring ourselves,"" he said. ""When Voyager did that, I think it did very well. I think the Seven of Nine stories gave us some insight into humanity and the meaning of humanity that the series sorely wanted. It had its moments. But when it did the exploding spaceships and space-monsters and so forth, the problem is that that's what everybody does in science fiction. I think that reduces Star Trek to being no better and worse than other science fiction shows."" Piller told Cinefantastique's Anna L. Kaplan (via TrekWeb). ""I have always encouraged the writers to try to find the human elements, the moral and ethical dilemmas,"" he said. ""I think there was less an appetite for that after I left."" Ultimately, Voyager lacked a distinctive voice; a style to call it's own. TOS featured a likable cast and featured parables. TNG went a step further with their stories, and made the crew more human, as character development and story arc's made the show more realistic. DS9 took a little of TNG's soap opera elements and took it in another direction, featuring a near series long arc that told the viewers nothing was as it seemed. Voyager attempted to take all those elements from the three previous series -and it worked only on occasion- but nothing else was added to the mix. There was no growth and change as the series aged because it had its Temporal Reset Button pushed week after week. And because of that, the show became fated to be a somewhat entertaining Star Trek series, but at the end of the day, offered nothing in the way of the next step in this franchise's evolutionary life.",3,"Oh good, it's the end",1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,4977,"['last', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'was', 'improvement', 'Chakotay/Seven', 'Nine', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'lame', 'really',

But, coming in the 7th season, it's too little, too late.First, the characters. Tom Paris and B'elanna Torres finally get married. It's about time. Why did it take so long? Think of all the potential episodes with them as a married couple that the writers missed out on because this development only came in season 7.Likewise, we finally see Seven of Nine grow. As much as I loved Seven in the previous seasons, her character was essentially in stasis. Two of my famous episodes, Imperfection and Human Error, show Seven really develop emotional bonds. We also see her fantasize and her internal frustration as she's prevented from reaching her goal to become more human. But again, this all comes far too late in the show, so we don't get to see the consequences of these changes until the very last episode.The Doctor gets several great outings, including ""Author, Author"" and ""Critical Care"". These are also the episodes with the deepest moral point in the spirit of the best of Trek.B'elanna gets a surprisingly strong episode with ""Lineage"". It was nice to see her struggle and come to grips with her past, including finally talking with her father. But again, I would love to have seen more of THIS B'elanna, but there's just not enough time.Of all the crew, I feel only Captain Janeway, Neelix, Seven of Nine, and the Doctor get proper swansongs. By the season finale, I felt like I was only just beginning to warm up to some of the supporting characters.Also, in terms of plot lines, season 7 really begins to realize the promise of having a ship stranded in the Delta Quadrant. The ""Void"" was a perfect argument for why the Voyager crew should stick to Starfleet's - and Star Trek's - ideals so far away from home. It should have come in season 1. We also get more interesting aliens and a greater sense of exploration. Again, too little, too late.The finale, ""Endgame"", was a big letdown. It was partly a rip on TNG's ""All Good Things"", partly ""First Contact"" redux. While the episode gave us plenty of Borg and time travel, what we didn't get is a farewell to the Voyager crew. Kathryn Janeway takes up most of the screentime, with a bit of last minute characterization involving the Seven-Chakotay romance. We barely get any denouement at the end to welcome them back to the Alpha Quadrant.With TNG, by season 7 I felt like we already knew the crew pretty well and the writers were getting tired (despite some great episodes like ""Pegasus""). With DS9's season 7, we got a satisfactory conclusion to the story arc and the characters' personal stories. But with Voyager, I feel like much of what we saw in season 7 really should have come much earlier in the season.",4,"too little, too late",1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,2795,"['season', 'felt', 'producers', 'writers', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'just', 'realized', 'what', 'show', 'needed', 'coming', '7th', 'season', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.First', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Paris', ""B'elanna"", 'Torres', 'finally', 'get', 'married', 'time', 'Why', 'did', 'take', 'so', 'long', 'Think', 'potential', 'episodes', 'married', 'couple', 'writers', 'missed', 'out', 'development', 'only', 'came', 'season', '7.Likewise', 'finally', 'see', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'grow', 'As', 'much', 'loved', 'Seven', 'previous', 'seasons', 'character', 'was', 'essentially', 'stasis', 'Two', 'famous', 'episodes', 'Imperfection', 'Human', 'Error', 'show', 'Seven', 'really', 'develop', 'emotional', 'bonds', 'also', 'see', 'fantasize', 'internal', 'frustration', 'prevented', 'reaching', 'goal', 'become', 'more', 'human', 'again', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'consequences', 'changes', 'very', 'last', 'episode.The', 'Doctor', 'several', 'great', 'outings', 'including', 'Author', 'Author', 'Critical', 'Care', 'are', 'also', 'episodes', 'deepest', 'moral', 'point', 'spirit', 'best', ""Trek.B'elanna"", 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'episode', 'Lineage', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'struggle', 'come', 'grips', 'past', 'including', 'finally', 'talking', 'father', 'again', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'THIS', ""B'elanna"", 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'crew', 'feel', 'only', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'Neelix', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'Doctor', 'get', 'proper', 'swansongs', 'season', 'finale', 'felt', 'was', 'only', 'just', 'beginning', 'warm', 'up', 'supporting', 'characters.Also', 'terms', 'plot', 'lines', 'season', '7', 'really', 'realize', 'promise', 'having', 'ship', 'stranded', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'Void', 'was', 'perfect', 'argument', 'why', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'should', 'stick', 'Starfleet', 'Star', 'Trek', 'ideals', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'home', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'season', '1', 'also', 'get', 'more', 'interesting', 'aliens', 'greater', 'sense', 'exploration', 'Again', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.The', 'finale', 'Endgame', 'was', 'big', 'letdown', 'was', 'partly', 'rip', 'TNG', 'Good', 'Things', 'partly', 'First', 'Contact', 'redux', 'episode', 'gave', 'plenty', 'Borg', 'time', 'travel', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'farewell', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'Kathryn', 'Janeway', 'up', 'most', 'screentime', 'bit', 'last', 'minute', 'characterization', 'involving', 'Seven-Chakotay', 'romance', 'barely', 'get', 'denouement', 'end', 'welcome', 'back', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant.With', 'TNG', 'season', '7', 'felt', 'already', 'knew', 'crew', 'pretty', 'well', 'writers', 'were', 'getting', 'tired', 'great', 'episodes', 'Pegasus', 'DS9', 'season', '7', 'got', 'satisfactory', 'conclusion', 'story', 'arc', 'characters', 'personal', 'stories', 'Voyager', 'feel', 'much', 'what', 'saw', 'season', '7', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'much', 'earlier', 'season']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Seventh Season
856250,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00062IDCO,Eric,"[10, 34]","I generally consider myself a Star Trek fan, but I've never gotten into Voyager, only watching the occasional episode here and there.  Thanks to a friend, I got the opportunity to catch season 7, but the result was yet another round of missed opportunities for the Trek series that boasted such an enticing premise.  Compared to the seventh seasons of TNG (4.5/5) and DS9 (4/5), this is definitely lagging quite a few steps behind.  That said, few of the episodes were outright terrible, as most were just mediocre, and there were a number of fairly enjoyable episodes as well.If Voyager is ultimately a TNG clone with a few minor twists, it comes up far short of its predecessor thanks to its mediocre cast and bland storytelling.  DS9 and Enterprise weren't perfect, but at least they delivered lengthy, epic story arcs that gave us tension, intrigue, moral quandaries, and cool space battles.Unimatrix Zero, Part II- C, not without some cool action and f/x, but ultimately drags too much when focusing on 7 of 9 and her romance.Imperfection- D, not being a Seven fan, I can't say I found this episode to be very entertaining.Drive- B-, not that bad, given that Paris and Torres make for a decent couple.  The race had its moments of humor.Repression- C+, starts out intriguing, but loses its momentum towards the end.Critical Care- C-, a subpar episode focusing on the holographic doctor.Nightingale- B-, pretty interesting to see Harry Kim take command, even if the episode doesn't really do anything outstanding.Flesh and Blood- B-, delivers some good tension and excitement, though it suffers a bit when focusing on the Doctor and his interaction with the other holograms.Shattered- B, probably the season's best episode, even if the premise comes across a bit gimmicky.  It's cool to see how Janeway and Chakotay interact given the situation.Lineage- C, Torres' back story makes for some rather weak drama.Repentance- D, had the potential for strong drama, but comes across too bland and predictable.Prophecy- B, a rather amusing episode thanks to the presence of an entire crew of Klingons.  There's some solid laughs and a bit of action towards the end.The Void- B, this episode does a pretty convincing job of creating a dire situation, though I think it would have been more dramatically effective if Janeway had violated the prime directive in this instance.Workforce- C-, rips off an already mediocre Stargate SG-1 episode.Q2- C-, not without its share of laughs thanks to the presence of Q, but his son is unbearably annoying and badly acted.Author, Author- B, an absolutely hilarious first half thanks to the Doctor's supremely silly holodeck novel gives way to a limp courtroom drama that was done better in TNG's The Measure of a Man.Friendship One- C+Natural Law- DRenaissance Man- C-, loved the Doctor's ""deathbed"" confession, but little else about this episode works.Endgame- C, the time travel premise seems like a cheap cop-out (and all the more frustrating when you recall the point the crew had made about not changing time back in Season 1's Eye of the Needle).

856294,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00062IDCO,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[5, 9]","Many television series don't last for a single season, some may only last one or two years, but some may become highly successful and have as many as seven seasons.  However, as is quite often the case, a series' seventh season is typically its final season giving its actors one last curtain call to rap up loose ends and say farewell to their loyal audience.  Such was the case for the highly successful television series ""Star Trek Voyager"", which aired between 1995 and 2001.  Based upon the original ""Star Trek"" universe concept created by the legendary Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's, ""Star Trek Voyager"" was the fourth television series to take its audience ""where no man had gone before"", and began only one year after the highly successful second ""Star Trek"" series, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", closed with its seventh season. For its efforts, a total of 172 episodes of ""Star Trek Voyager"" were filmed and aired, with all but the first season having 26 episodes.  The initial first season only had 16 episodes, but was a good start for what ultimately became a fine sci-fi television series thanks to the efforts of Rick Berman, Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor.What made ""Star Trek Voyager"" unique from its three predecessors was its placement within the ""Star Trek"" universe.  The previous three series took place primarily in what is referred to as the Alpha Quadrant of the Milky Way Galaxy.  Contained within the Alpha Quadrant are the familiar United Federation of Planets guarded by Starfleet, the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Empire, the Cardassians and several other alien races very familiar to ""Star Trek"" aficionados.  Excursions were made into the Beta and Gamma Quadrants (especially in ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" and its wormhole that lead deep into the Gamma Quadrant), but very little was known about the very distant Delta Quadrant, except for the species known as the Borg that were introduced to Starfleet in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" thanks to the shenanigans of the interfering & powerful alien known simply as Q (John de Lancie).""Star Trek Voyager"", then, became the vehicle by which the unknown Delta Quadrant at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy could become known and defined within the ""Star Trek"" universe, but not due to human means.  Instead, a very powerful alien (not Q) during the first episode of ""Star Trek Voyager"" pulled the starship, a Maqi ship and their respective crews deep into the Delta Quadrant.  Even while traveling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take a ship several decades to traverse the vast distance to return to Earth. Hence, the seven-year series focused on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew (combined with the Maqi crew), who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of going. Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.The primary cast members of the seventh season of ""Voyager"" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Ensign Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., ""The Doctor"", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok (Tim Russ), Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) and the former Borg drone Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan). Voyager's seventh season begins with the episode ""Unimatrix Zero, Part 2"".  In this continuation of the sixth-season cliffhanger final episode, the Borg Queen (Susanna Thompson) decides to destroy the subversive Unimatrix Zero once and for all, but Captain Janeway sees it as an opportunity to infiltrate the Borg collective by way of a virus.  When the Borg Queen finds a cube with three infected drones, she destroys it.  To protect the drones that can visit Unimatrix Zero from being discovered and destroyed, Captain Janeway & Seven of Nine decide to destroy it.During the seventh season of ""Voyager"", Seven of Nine faces death in episode ""Imperfection"", the Doctor is kidnapped in episode ""Critical Care"", Lt. Barclay (Dwight Schultz) visits Voyager as a hologram in episode ""Inside Man"", B'Elanna discovers shes pregnant in episode ""Lineage"", Q visits Voyager again in episode ""Q2"", Neelix leaves Voyager in episode ""Homestead"" and Admiral Catherine Janeway from the future visits to help voyager home in the two part series final&eacute; ""Endgame"". The best seventh-season episodes, in order of airdate, include ""Unimatrix Zero, Part 2"", ""Imperfection"", ""Critical Care"", ""Inside Man"", ""Body and Soul"", ""Lineage"", ""Repentance"", ""Prophecy"", ""The Void"", ""Human Error"", ""Q2"", ""Author, Author"", ""Friendship One"", ""Natural Law"", ""Renaissance Man"", ""Endgame, Part 1"" and series final&eacute; ""Endgame, Part 2"".  The least memorable seventh-season episodes include ""Flesh and Blood, Parts 1 & 2"", ""Shattered"", ""Workforce, Parts 1 & 2"" and ""Homestead"".Overall, I rate the seventh season of ""Voyager"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was on par with the sixth season for the most part, but ended on a high-note with the series final&eacute;.

The America that I grew up with faced an uncertain future as we were not sure where we were heading with this new president who came to office under none of the best circumstances.  The dot-com bubble was bursting and people who made money off of it were realizing that this was just all paper to begin with.  This is the backdrop of the end of ""Star Trek:  Voyager"" as a TV series.  This was the first of the ""Star Trek"" series where I saw it from beginning to end as it was aired.  This was the season where they were going to tie loose ends up.Communications between Starfleet and Voyager strengthened as Barclay found a way to contact Voyager in the Delta Quadrant.  We would find Neelix leaving to stay with a colony of Telaxians in an asteroid field where he would stay with the woman of his dreams and then become the Federation Ambassador to the Delta Quadrant.As usual, the season began with a cliffhanger as Janeway and crew find themselves needing to outwit the Borg.  It even required Janeway, Tuvok and Torres to become assimilated in order to do it.  Speaking of Borg, 7 of 9 and Chakotay discovery they have feelings for each other and that might pose problems at the final episode.The importance of heading home weighs most heavily on Tuvok, when he discovers he has a disease that can only be cured by brain tissue from a member of his family--which would be very simple if they were in the Alpha Quadrant, but not so simple in the Delta Quadrant.Of course, there is later in the season a pregnant Torres, who winds up giving birth to hers and Paris' first child in the final episode, as Voyager manages her way out of a Borg Ship sent by the Queen to stop Janeway from taking a transwarp conduit home.At the end, it was great that they ended the series the way that they did--they finally made it home inside a Borg Ship that they wind up destroying from the inside at Wolf-359 in front of a Federation fleet not sure what they would encounter.  ""Endgame"" also displayed Janeway's continuing obsession with finding a way home and that even after she got there, she was finding a way to get her crew home faster in another timeline.What happened to the crew after they arrived?  We know about Janeway--for some reason, Starfleet promoted her to Admiral, where we would see her reprise her role in ""Star Trek:  Nemesis"".  She should have faced a court martial and/or a board of inquiry first for getting that ship and that crew lost in the badlands 7 years earlier.  Whereas""DS9"" seemed sentimental and sappy in its final episode, we find ""Voyager"" triumphant--destroying the Borg (...or did they?) and getting home in 7 years as opposed to the original 16.",5,Season 7--Voyager Finally Makes It Home,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,2736,"['Here', 'are', 'May', '2001', 'September', '11th', '4', 'months', 'away', 'America', 'grew', 'up', 'faced', 'uncertain', 'future', 'were', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'were', 'heading', 'new', 'president', 'who', 'came', 'office', 'none', 'best', 'circumstances', 'dot-com', 'bubble', 'was', 'bursting', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'money', 'were', 'realizing', 'was', 'just', 'paper', 'begin', 'backdrop', 'end', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'where', 'saw', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'aired', 'was', 'season', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'tie', 'loose', 'ends', 'up.Communications', 'Starfleet', 'Voyager', 'strengthened', 'Barclay', 'found', 'way', 'contact', 'Voyager', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'would', 'find', 'Neelix', 'leaving', 'stay', 'colony', 'Telaxians', 'asteroid', 'field', 'where', 'would', 'stay', 'woman', 'dreams', 'then', 'become', 'Federation', 'Ambassador', 'Delta', 'Quadrant.As', 'usual', 'season', 'began', 'cliffhanger', 'Janeway', 'crew', 'find', 'needing', 'outwit', 'Borg', 'even', 'required', 'Janeway', 'Tuvok', 'Torres', 'become', 'assimilated', 'order', 'do', 'Speaking', 'Borg', '7', '9', 'Chakotay', 'discovery', 'have', 'feelings', 'other', 'might', 'pose', 'problems', 'final', 'episode.The', 'importance', 'heading', 'home', 'weighs', 'most', 'heavily', 'Tuvok', 'when', 'disease', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'cured', 'brain', 'tissue', 'member', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'simple', 'were', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'not', 'so', 'simple', 'Delta', 'Quadrant.Of', 'course', 'later', 'season', 'pregnant', 'Torres', 'who', 'up', 'giving', 'birth', 'hers', 'Paris', 'first', 'child', 'final', 'episode', 'Voyager', 'way', 'Borg', 'Ship', 'sent', 'Queen', 'stop', 'Janeway', 'taking', 'transwarp', 'conduit', 'end', 'was', 'great', 'ended', 'series', 'way', 'did', 'finally', 'made', 'home', 'Borg', 'Ship', 'wind', 'up', 'destroying', 'inside', 'Wolf-359', 'front', 'Federation', 'fleet', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'would', 'encounter', 'Endgame', 'also', 'displayed', 'Janeway', 'continuing', 'obsession', 'finding', 'way', 'home', 'even', 'got', 'there', 'was', 'finding', 'way', 'get', 'crew', 'home', 'faster', 'timeline.What', 'happened', 'crew', 'arrived', 'know', 'Janeway', 'reason', 'Starfleet', 'promoted', 'Admiral', 'where', 'would', 'see', 'reprise', 'role', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Nemesis', 'should', 'have', 'faced', 'court', 'martial', 'and/or', 'board', 'inquiry', 'first', 'getting', 'ship', 'crew', 'lost', 'badlands', '7', 'years', 'earlier', 'Whereas', 'DS9', 'seemed', 'sentimental', 'sappy', 'final', 'episode', 'find', 'Voyager', 'triumphant', 'destroying', 'Borg', 'did', 'getting', 'home', '7', 'years', 'opposed', 'original', '16']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Seventh Season

856300,AQRFR7YYF7HE1,B00062IDCO,Nathan,"[0, 0]","So many times in Trek there is a logical or scientific approach to (in this case) temporal mechanics that allow the viewer to follow along using their brain and it makes sense. Kirk faced The Guardian of Forever. Picard in Yesterday's Enterprise, you get the picture that good credible SF can exist in Trek, but when episodes like this one come about, the writers throw everything and anything into it, that it becomes more fantasy. Doctor Who does this shattering effect better than any. Entertaining it may be, yet when a mashup of timelines exist that would confuse even Doc Brown from Back To The Future let alone the most avid of Trekkers it destroys the premise.The reasons for criticism from those of us who are Trekkers is because we enjoy Trek, and don't feel that we should have to turn off our brain on every episode. Credible SF is what made shows like Stargate successful. Gateheads follow the science and mechanics of Stargate just like those in Star Wars and Doctor Who. Criticism of a show like Star Trek is no different. When writers abandon what has been established as canon, then the material becomes mashed up and becomes less SF and more fantasy.Janeway decided to end it all by changing history so that the last seven years didn't happen. Even revisiting this show years later I can see why Voyager didn't stand out as well as the previous shows. I love Star Trek, but Voyager dismissed so much of the physics, the science of what made Trek credible, that it becomes nonsensical.As so many 3-5 star ratings argue the show is entertaining, and I agree there are some decent episodes. However, after 7 years, the Doctor still has no name, Tom Paris is still a Lt., Ensign Kim has never been promoted despite having been in command. And proof that Janeway hates her crew and must proclaim herself God, by erasing the whole history and legacy of Voyager's journey. So much for Janeway's supposed ethics, let alone the viewer who watched 7 years to find out yet again, who cares about the Prime Directive.

856309,A9UWM1RO8YQIJ,B00062IDCO,Ray Wright,"[0, 0]","Voyager, the third spin-off of the highly successful original Star Trek series from the late 1960&#8217;s, holds its own with the previous spin-offs, Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.  Due to its plotline, being lost in the Delta quadrant, it was able to venture into material the other series couldn&#8217;t.  While they still used a lost Klingon or Ferengi, not to mention &#8220;Q&#8221;, they moved on to new cultures, creatures, and scientific advances.That said, I found the writing to be superb insofar as plotlines, and character development.  One sore point was Capt. Janeway.  There&#8217;s no way in all of creation a ship&#8217;s captain makes so many bad decisions and comes out without a scratch.  The command decisions she made during the last year of the series were at best head scratching.  While I find the writing to be inventive and resourceful insofar as the new ideas presented, the ultra liberal bent of character Janeway, clearly shows why a liberal government or in this case a ship&#8217;s captain, is destructive to society as a whole.  I say this not to reflect on the actress Kate Mulgrew, she only played the part written for her.  Then again, it is a syfi/fantasy show so anything goes.The acting becomes automatic, as in any TV show where the actor plays the part for any length of time.  There were standout parts, as in Robert Picardo as the holographic doctor, who was also a standout actor in the Stargate spin-off SG1.  I can&#8217;t say enough good things about his acting.  Thanks to the writers for giving him a lot of air time.  Roxanne Dawson was superb as B'Elanna Torres, and Jeri Ryan (Seven of Nine) how did she keep such a stiff attitude for so many shows.  I think she was one of everyone&#8217;s favorites.All in all a series worth watching, certainly as good as Next Generation, but maybe a bit shy of matching Deep Space Nine, but an excellent choice once you except the ultra liberal slant of the Janeway character.  You do grow to accept her as the captain; only one you wouldn&#8217;t want to serve under.  In real life she would have killed her entire crew the first year.  She did manage to get them lost in the Delta quadrant.",4,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,2187,"['Voyager', 'third', 'spin-off', 'highly', 'successful', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'late', '1960', '8217', 'own', 'previous', 'spin-offs', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Due', 'plotline', 'being', 'lost', 'Delta', 'quadrant', 'was', 'able', 'venture', 'material', 'other', 'series', 'couldn', '8217', 't.', 'still', 'used', 'lost', 'Klingon', 'Ferengi', 'not', 'mention', '8220', 'Q', '8221', 'moved', 'new', 'cultures', 'creatures', 'scientific', 'advances.That', 'said', 'found', 'writing', 'be', 'superb', 'insofar', 'plotlines', 'character', 'development', 'One', 'sore', 'point', 'was', 'Capt', 'Janeway', '8217', 'way', 'creation', 'ship', '8217', 'captain', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'decisions', 'out', 'scratch', 'command', 'decisions', 'made', 'last', 'year', 'series', 'were', 'best', 'head', 'scratching', 'find', 'writing', 'be', 'inventive', 'resourceful', 'insofar', 'new', 'ideas', 'presented', 'ultra', 'liberal', 'bent', 'character', 'Janeway', 'clearly', 'why', 'liberal', 'government', 'case', 'ship', '8217', 'captain', 'destructive', 'society', 'whole', 'say', 'not', 'reflect', 'actress', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'only', 'played', 'part', 'written', 'Then', 'again', 'syfi/fantasy', 'show', 'so', 'anything', 'goes.The', 'acting', 'becomes', 'automatic', 'TV', 'show', 'where', 'actor', 'part', 'length', 'time', 'were', 'standout', 'parts', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'holographic', 'doctor', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'standout', 'actor', 'Stargate', 'spin-off', 'SG1', 'can', '8217', 't', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'acting', 'Thanks', 'writers', 'giving', 'lot', 'air', 'time', 'Roxanne', 'Dawson', 'was', 'superb', ""B'Elanna"", 'Torres', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'how', 'did', 'keep', 'stiff', 'attitude', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'everyone', '8217', 's', 'favorites.All', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'certainly', 'as', 'good', 'Next', 'Generation', 'maybe', 'bit', 'shy', 'matching', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'excellent', 'choice', 'once', 'ultra', 'liberal', 'slant', 'Janeway', 'character', 'do', 'grow', 'accept', 'captain', 'only', 'one', 'wouldn', '8217', 'want', 'serve', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'entire', 'crew', 'first', 'year', 'did', 'manage', 'get', 'lost', 'Delta', 'quadrant']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Seventh Season

As we get older, we all ponder ""what if?"" However, consider this: in ""City on the Edge of Forever,"" ""The Voyage Home,"" and ""First Contact,"" history must be corrected to save the planet.In ""Endgame,"" Janeway alters destiny because she didn't like that it took her 23 years to get home and tragedies befell some crew members whom she regarded as family. Captain Kirk let the woman he loved die to prevent Hitler from winning WW2!Purists please correct me if I'm wrong, but there should have been some discussion/discovery about how the timeline was altered for the worse and old Janeway's actions were necessary to restore balance. Otherwise, it's one bitter and cranky old lady's desire to change history because she didn't like what happened. Given the Theory of Unintended Consequences, she could have set into motion a series of events that could have proven disastrous for the Federation. At the very least, she altered the destinies of trillions of lives across the United Federation of Planets, some perhaps for the better, others probably for the worse.

Season 7 is kinda weird, in the fact that obviously being the last season, there are things that happen that really throw the crew off course, namely ""Workforce I and II"" and ""Drive"".  On the plus side for focusing so heavily on those two characters, it's nice to see that we really stretch out their characters, to see just how human a Hologram and a former Borg can be.  The best episodes this season include ""Unimatrix Zero II,"" ""Imperfection,"" ""Shattered,"" ""Repentance,"" ""The Void,"" ""Q2,"" ""Renaissance Man,"" and of course the Series Finale ""Endgame.""  To touch on some of this, ""Shattered"" is a great story, that takes us to various pasts and futures of Voyager, with Commander Chakotay being the only person able to safely traverse the ship.
