She's a fabulous actress, author, and playwright. I disagree with one of the reviews about this movie being too dark and blurry. For me, it was just the opposite. It was a beautiful explosion of color, and the cinematography was a joy to watch.This story revolves around Nigerian newlyweds who are unable to conceive after almost 2 years of marriage. The mother-in-law really pissed me off. She was the reason for all of the drama. So, here's the spoiler alert: If you plan on seeing this movie, you may want to stop reading...You're still here? Ok.Something was seriously wrong with all of these weak-minded fools. The bride was unable to have a baby after only 18 months. Personally, I don't think that's a long time to try to have a baby. My husband and I spent years trying to conceive, and it can be a long process. The bride wasn't sure whether it was her or her husband who was at fault. Her husband refused to see a fertility specialist.  I don't think this is a reason for a woman to sleep with her brother-in-law.The mother-in-law was the first one to plant this wicked seed in the minds of the bride and the brother-in-law. She caused too much stress on the family by making the following suggestions. #1 that the husband should take another wife since the first one couldn't get pregnant. #2 The wife should screw her brother-in-law (the mother-in-law's other son) to try to get pregnant. #3 the bride should go back to Nigeria (they were currently living in NY) and leave her son alone. In the end, the bride and the brother-in-law agree to have sex (numerous times) to make a baby.This family was sad, deceitful, and weak-minded. It just ain't that critical to have a baby -- especially when the husband had no problem with his wife not being able to get pregnant. The evil mother-in-law was the issue. In the end, when the husband found out his wife and brother had sex, he was pissed. But he got over it and accepted the child. His mother convinced him that the child belonged to everyone.This whole premise was nasty to me. But I guess the point of a movie is to keep people talking about it, and that's just what I've been doing for days. If you can handle some intense sex scenes and moderate subtitles (they speak Nigerian a lot), then this is the movie for you.",4,Different and thought-provoking,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,2382,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Danai', 'Gurira', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'movie', 'knew', 'had', 'watch', 'fabulous', 'actress', 'author', 'playwright', 'disagree', 'one', 'reviews', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'dark', 'blurry', 'was', 'just', 'opposite', 'was', 'beautiful', 'explosion', 'color', 'cinematography', 'was', 'joy', 'watch.This', 'story', 'revolves', 'Nigerian', 'newlyweds', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'conceive', 'almost', '2', 'years', 'marriage', 'mother-in-law', 'really', 'pissed', 'off', 'was', 'reason', 'drama', 'So', 'here', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'plan', 'seeing', 'movie', 'may', 'want', 'stop', 'reading', ""'re"", 'still', 'here', 'Ok.Something', 'was', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'weak-minded', 'fools', 'bride', 'was', 'unable', 'have', 'baby', 'only', '18', 'months', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'long', 'time', 'try', 'have', 'baby', 'husband', 'spent', 'years', 'trying', 'conceive', 'can', 'be', 'long', 'process', 'bride', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'fault', 'husband', 'refused', 'see', 'fertility', 'specialist', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'reason', 'woman', 'sleep', 'brother-in-law.The', 'mother-in-law', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'plant', 'wicked', 'seed', 'minds', 'bride', 'brother-in-law', 'caused', 'too', 'much', 'stress', 'family', 'making', 'following', 'suggestions', '1', 'husband', 'should', 'take', 'wife', 'first', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'pregnant', '2', 'wife', 'should', 'screw', 'brother-in-law', 'mother-in-law', 'other', 'son', 'try', 'get', 'pregnant', '3', 'bride', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'Nigeria', 'were', 'currently', 'living', 'NY', 'leave', 'son', 'alone', 'end', 'bride', 'brother-in-law', 'agree', 'have', 'sex', 'numerous', 'times', 'make', 'baby.This', 'family', 'was', 'sad', 'deceitful', 'weak-minded', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'that', 'critical', 'have', 'baby', 'especially', 'when', 'husband', 'had', 'problem', 'wife', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'pregnant', 'evil', 'mother-in-law', 'was', 'issue', 'end', 'when', 'husband', 'found', 'wife', 'brother', 'had', 'sex', 'was', 'pissed', 'got', 'accepted', 'child', 'mother', 'convinced', 'child', 'belonged', 'everyone.This', 'whole', 'premise', 'was', 'nasty', 'guess', 'point', 'movie', 'keep', 'people', 'talking', 'just', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'days', 'can', 'handle', 'intense', 'sex', 'scenes', 'moderate', 'subtitles', 'speak', 'Nigerian', 'lot', 'then', 'movie']",Mother of George

Cain,"[1, 2]","The film tells the story of a newly married Nigerian couple in Brooklyn who own and manage a small restaurant while struggling with fertility issues. The plot was good, mother in law buts into the life of her son and his new wife. The Mother in Law tries to get her son to leave his wife when after two years she does not produce a child, then when that doesn't work she cons the daughter in law into sleeping with her other son and once she gets pregnant it all blows up.The movie stars Danai Gurira who does a great job and I think it would have been a great movie, in fact I saw where others gave it 5 stars but I have to wonder how you grade a movie you can't see.Director Andrew Dosunmu  took dark skinned Africans and placed them in night time conditions or in dark rooms. It became a movie of shadows and blurred images. The only time you could honestly see anything is when the scenes were shot outdoors.

We can put different clothes on people and make their skin darker and we think they will then be different from what is normal for our specie.  The decisions made in this family DRAMA goes on around the world.  The playing out of this drama has a Nigerian flavor but every bit of it: the logic, the decision-making, then the guilt and shame, and more painful drama, and more guilt and shame and in-law interference is normal....there isn't 100 families on earth that do not know some drama like this. So while the movie script was great, I must agree  with one post--the lighting was definitely a factor.  It was low budgeted probably but even so: THIS MOVIE HAS A WHOLE LOT TO THINK ABOUT...how we do things as people and who we try so hard to please.  Sure it is culture, a cultural interpretation, but these people are in America now.  This woman did not have to get pregnant.  In our country we would tell the mother-in-law to mind her own business and we would applaude the dress-making by the wife so she could have some money of her own.  Would we agree with what she did to solve her problem?  Probably not.  We would have thought it horrid.  But the mother in law is right: it has been done for ages for the same reasons--not to mention that if a woman doesn't have a baby, a son especially, in some places around the world,she is treated very badly.

1677255,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00G6Q4TOK,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 1]","we meet the beautiful bride at her gorgeous, elaborate traditional wedding. she looks at least 30 but is treated as a trembling virgin by the attendants preparing her for the wedding night. their excessive care and attentiveness would more believably mesh with a teenage or early 20s bride, so the story almost immediately strikes a false note as the bride is neither a teen nor in her early 20s. we see her husband who looks older than she, but they are both treated by the other characters and the story as if they are spring chickens, which is obviously not the case. though they are a good actress/actor, they are miscast as they are too old, their faces too lived in, for this story of a dominant mother in law controlling the reproductive lives of her maleable sons and daughter in law. a mother in law with the amount of control this story shows would more believably work with a much younger couple. these newlyweds are in the beginning stages of middle age and the story is unconvincing because of their age (also the story is not well executed - see the 1985 film version of Pride and Prejudice for an example of a well executed film story). I went on wikipedia to look at the actors: the actress playing the bride, though gorgeous, was I believe around 32 at the time of the filming and the actor playing her husband was in his 50s. it's really hard, though not impossible, for a 30 something to play a barely 20 something person, and in my opinion, it is impossible for someone in their early 50s to play a man in his 20s; even physical movement is impacted by life, so a middle age man doesn't walk as a young man would.back to the story: the newlyweds are in love: we see it through the care the bride takes of her husband, and by his appreciation. we follow her through fertility issues and the pressure her mother in law puts on her to reproduce. the wife makes several mistakes all linked to low self esteem: she wants to work but her husband doesn't want her to so she doesn't; she wants to visit a fertility specialist but her husband refuses to participate so she drops it; she becomes increasingly fearful that her husband will take more wives if she doesn't get pregnant and she allows her fear and her mother in law to manipulate her into having sex with her brother in law, at her mother in law's suggestion, to become pregnant. she becomes pregnant, is torn with guilt over cheating on her husband, tells him, and he explodes. he confronts his mother but even then she doesn't concede she did anything wrong by advising her daughter in law to impregnate herself with her son's brother's sperm. in my opinion, most mothers would not advocate such a choice. as this mother does it would've been good if the writer/director had explained why and how this transplanted culture works, so that the audience could understand why these characters behave as they do.the story ends with the wife in labor at hospital; though we don't see what becomes of her or her baby, her friend, mother in law, husband and brother in law waiting in the waiting room don't look relieved when the doctor apparently tells them the labor is over. the ending is ambiguous and we don't know the status of the mother or her child, though we do see the husband going to see his wife. no one is crying so apparently both mother and child survivewhat I like about the film: cinematography, some of the framing, vibrant colors, acting, people of color socializing, making mistakes, having fun, having sex. also liked seeing people's feet, which many films don't show for some reason. this cinematographer likes showing characters bottom half, down to their feet, which is a nice change from usual cinematography. I liked the music and it wasn't overdone, though I didn't think the opera worked.what I disliked: the story wasn't told well. should've been a character study. audience should've been introduced to the woman before her wedding. we needed to see her and learn about her own family, her support group beyond her one friend. how did she come to America, what does she think of it, did she work before her marriage, is she educated, how did she meet her husband, what was their courtship like, didn't she know her mother in law and her mother in law's expectations before the marriage? too much information is left out so when things go badly for her, we don't care as much as we would have had we known who she is. we know her as a devoted wife, she lives pretty traditionally, she likes to sew and is a talented seamstress, she loves her husband and wants a baby. she is hesitant to dress in modern apparel and when her husband says he dislikes a new revealing blouse her friend buys her, she appears to be embarrassed and covers herself. she listens to her elders and follows their advice even when she doesn't want to. why? she clings to traditional dress in modern New York. why? her husband dislikes the sheer top and says she is showing what should be just for his eyes. would've been good if the writer gave more information explaining the nuts and bolts of the Nigerian culture. I see the conservatism. is it religion based, paternal based. it certainly doesn't seem ethically based as the husband's own mother advises his wife to cheat on him to get pregnant. the values as presented seem somewhat flexible. would've liked to understand them abit better.the wife is smart: she has good instincts, but she doesn't follow through. she is also dumb in that she accepts her mother in law's advice to have sex with another, and when she accepts her husband's edict that she not work, and that they not seek medical help. she is smart and she is dumb simultaneously, but mostly she has no self confidence, no belief in her own abilities. she doesn't do what she thinks is best for her but is willing, childlike, to follow the knuckle-headed advice of others - in this way the story shows how harmful unsupportive cultures can be to a woman. she tells her husband that he is allowing his mother to ruin their lives, but after he refuses to do anything about it, she follows his lead. so though she has good instincts, she allows her mother in law and her husband to stifle them, dumbing herself down because they have the familial and economic power. in a triangle of three, she respects her mother in law and her husband more than she respects herself, apparently mostly out of blind tradition and also because she has little money (though I am not certain about that as she says her mother is flying in and asks her husband to come with her to collect her from the airport. If her mother can fly that suggests her mother has some resources. film gives mixed and insufficient information.) she follows her mother in law and her husband, and obeys them even when she knows they are wrong. and she pays the price for it - loss of the quality of her marriage which she valued above all else. 2 and 1/2 stars.P.S. I see this as a cautionary tale: to thine own self be true, but it would've impacted me much more had the writer attached me to the wife. Had I known who she was beyond being just a woman in love, an expat Nigerian, a fish out of water. The writer should've shown me who this specific woman is, then, through understanding her I would've really understood what it's like to be a second or third class citizen in Nigerian culture. Why, exactly, does she feel so powerless? This story, how culture, tradition, and fear can harm an individual is adequately demonstrated here, but I didn't feel I knew the individual well enough for my heart to break for her. I would've liked the story to be so well told that my heart broke for this poor, timid, frightened woman. But I didn't know what was at stake. in other words, if she'd gone against her mother in law and her husband, what was the worse that could've happened? What did she fear that was so bad that she'd rather sleep with her brother in law and become pregnant by him, rather than to stand up for herself and be her own woman? She is a coward true; there is always a price to pay for bravery, but what was the price that this poor woman felt was too large to be borne? This is vital information the writer doesn't show us, and not knowing what it is, the audience cannot truly sympathize with her. Had her marriage as she wanted it to be failed because she couldn't become pregnant, had her husband taken subsequent wives, what would that have meant for her? A reduction in status? Income? Her husband's love? What? Had she taken a job, earned her own money and gone to the fertility specialist only to learn that she was fertile, she could've given that information to her husband and her mother in law. She is not a child. Why does she feel she has no power rights in her own marriage? Apparently she chooses tradition even over her own preferences and rights. Not very appealing. I think the writer needed to flesh her out more, and as I said, to explain what the woman feared. That she feared I could see. More wives to compete with but I have no idea what childlessness meant to her. Why would a newlywed almost from the get-go take pregnancy tests.Basically, don't feel writer explained the nuts and bolts of the culture or explained what the woman feared would happen to her if she bore no children. I saw the scene where her husband was chatting with two other women and I saw the wife's fear of losing him. As the first of several wives, could she eventually be cast out, made homeless, if she bore no children? Why marry a man who could take multiple wives if you did not want to live such a lifestyle? That's certainly something she should've discussed before marriage. Really needed more information from the writer here. In Chinese culture as far as I understand, children are expected to take care of their aging parents, or at least that was the case traditionally because there was no societal safety net years ago. If Nigerians feel the same, would've been good for writer to show that.",2,yet another woman with low self esteem who allows her life to be ruined (SPOILERS)...,1398211200,"04 23,
