1206593,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001JP6414,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","Please Murder Me!, 1956 filmThis movie starred Angela Lansbury as beautiful and talented Myra Leeds who is accused of murdering her rich husband Joe (played by Dick Foran). Raymond Burr is trial lawyer Craig Carlson who defends her in court. But what if justice was derailed? Lamont Johnson plays Carl Holt. This story tells how Craig Carlson and Joe Leeds were friends since Iwo Jima. Joe married Myra, an art student, after a short courtship. But Myra became friendly with Craig. Can a good lawyer get her off from a murder charge due to reasonable doubt? Joe Leeds wrote a letter blaming his death on his faithless wife. Later Craig learns Myra was always in love with fellow student Carl Holt, and is now free to marry him and travel to Europe. Myra is richer as a widow than a divorcee. The flaw in this story is the self-sacrifice of her lawyer. Was it due to being a rejected lover?Were there differences between defense lawyer Craig Carlson and District Attorney Frank Marlowe in ""A Place in the Sun""? Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" was said to be based on a true crime in 1906 upstate New York. There were other examples from real life where a poor girl becomes unwanted by an ambitious young man. A ""Prince Charming"" can turn into a ""Bluebeard"". Was lawyer Craig Carlson modeled after ""Perry Mason""? [Was it a coincidence that a slimmer Raymond Burr was later selected to play ""Perry Mason"" on the television series?] This story would have made a good episode on ""The Twilight Zone"".",3,The Case of the Scheming Wife,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,1503,"['Please', 'Murder', 'Me', '1956', 'filmThis', 'movie', 'starred', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Myra', 'Leeds', 'who', 'accused', 'murdering', 'rich', 'husband', 'Joe', 'played', 'Dick', 'Foran', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'Craig', 'Carlson', 'who', 'court', 'what', 'justice', 'was', 'derailed', 'Lamont', 'Johnson', 'Carl', 'Holt', 'story', 'how', 'Craig', 'Carlson', 'Joe', 'Leeds', 'were', 'friends', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Joe', 'married', 'Myra', 'art', 'student', 'short', 'courtship', 'Myra', 'became', 'friendly', 'Craig', 'Can', 'good', 'lawyer', 'get', 'off', 'murder', 'charge', 'due', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'Joe', 'Leeds', 'wrote', 'letter', 'blaming', 'death', 'faithless', 'wife', 'Later', 'Craig', 'Myra', 'was', 'always', 'love', 'fellow', 'student', 'Carl', 'Holt', 'now', 'free', 'marry', 'travel', 'Europe', 'Myra', 'richer', 'widow', 'divorcee', 'flaw', 'story', 'self-sacrifice', 'lawyer', 'due', 'being', 'rejected', 'lover', 'Were', 'differences', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'Craig', 'Carlson', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Frank', 'Marlowe', 'Place', 'Sun', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'crime', '1906', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'were', 'other', 'examples', 'real', 'life', 'where', 'poor', 'girl', 'becomes', 'unwanted', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'can', 'turn', 'Bluebeard', 'Was', 'lawyer', 'Craig', 'Carlson', 'modeled', 'Perry', 'Mason', '[', 'Was', 'coincidence', 'slimmer', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'was', 'later', 'selected', 'play', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'television', 'series', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone']",N/A
