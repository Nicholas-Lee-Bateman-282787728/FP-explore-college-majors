The other most famous adaptation of this book, Disney's Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, is poorly animated, makes tons of pointless changes, and just doesn't tell a very good story.Rankin-Bass's Wind in the Willows, on the other hand, has good songs, more visual appeal, and better voice acting, and it's much more faithful to the book. The characters really feel like themselves; they capture Mole's innocence, Badger's intransigence, Ratty's affability and Toad's mania beautifully, and all of the characters come across as people you'd like to spend time with.It's a real shame this film hasn't been restored and released on DVD, as it's one of my favorite book-to-film adaptations.",5,A faithful adaptation,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,727,"['really', 'not', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'most', 'famous', 'adaptation', 'book', 'Disney', 'Mr.', 'Toad', 'Wild', 'Ride', 'poorly', 'animated', 'tons', 'pointless', 'changes', 'just', ""n't"", 'tell', 'very', 'good', 'story.Rankin-Bass', 'Wind', 'Willows', 'other', 'hand', 'good', 'songs', 'more', 'visual', 'appeal', 'better', 'voice', 'acting', 'much', 'more', 'faithful', 'book', 'characters', 'really', 'feel', 'capture', 'Mole', 'innocence', 'Badger', 'intransigence', 'Ratty', 'affability', 'Toad', 'mania', 'beautifully', 'characters', 'come', 'people', ""'d"", 'like', 'spend', 'time', 'with.It', 'real', 'shame', 'film', ""n't"", 'been', 'restored', 'released', 'DVD', 'one', 'favorite', 'book-to-film', 'adaptations']",N/A

110313,A31ACI0E88ORDE,0790742632,The Great White Father,"[0, 0]","********THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS********There is no ""the"" definitive adaptation of ""The Wind in the Willows"", in my opinion.  Even among the best (and besides this one I'm including the Cosgrove Hall stop-motion animated film--and series--and also the John Coates animated version narrated by Vanessa Redgrave, made by the same people who did ""The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends""), each has its merits and its flaws.  There is no reason not to familiarize yourself with the Cosgrove Hall or John Coates versions at ALL--both have excellence to them and things I appreciate, and this film certainly has its flaws.I'm trying to go by what I think is objectively best, not what I like the most personally.  I'm also not including all adaptations: I'm not including the ""movie"" cobbled together from two miniseries, for example, which added too much unnecessarily and didn't have the same feel to it--I don't really consider that a film adaptation whatever its merits--nor am I including the Disney version (which cut out too much and missed the point) nor any live-action version (too hard to suspend my disbelief).  This is why I'm limiting it to these three.So why am I leaning towards this being the best of the three?  I'm looking to what is most important in terms of what I'm looking for in an adaptation of specifically this story.  Besides things like tone, themes, plot, pacing, characters, animation, performances, and music, there is also the question of faithfulness to the book and what that means, and of course good quality--and the question of in what order do all these things matter?  Doing that academically is a headache, plus it may even defeat the purpose.  The book is humbling, feeling like Scripture--I hardly even felt up to the task of reviewing it--so perhaps initial gut feeling is more to be listened to here.I'm not sure if this film lives up to the same feeling--indeed, it seems that the Cosgrove Hall version does that best, in addition to the quality of the pacing and the songs (which are both faithful to Mr. Grahame and of good quality there), but it is not enough.  Aside from cutting out ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"", the most important chapter in the book (though there is an excellent episode of the TV series based on that chapter), as well as one of the Mr. Toad chapters (though this and ""Wayfarers All"" also became episodes of the TV series), I fear that the point of the story is lost by the ending being changed in the Cosgrove Hall version (it doesn't help that it's identical to Disney's changed ending and so may have taken inspiration therefrom, and that's the worst thing about the Disney version).  And while this doesn't erase all the good of the Cosgrove Hall version (even including the TV series), the ending is the last chance to make a lasting impression, so the fact that this badness is at the end is a problem.Arguably the John Coates version is more accurate--leastways it has parts of all 12 chapters in it--but besides being even shorter than the Cosgrove Hall version (74 minutes), it has a frame story with Vanessa Redgrave and some children, making it shorter still.  Consequently this film is fast-paced, not what an adaptation of the book should be (less than six minutes on average for each chapter, and because some are longer than that, others are necessarily shorter), and it's hard to keep up and remember everything--it can feel chaotic at times.  That's not to deny the very real beauty of this version, especially in terms of the animation (I like the expressions on the characters' faces a LOT), score, and performances--but for this particular book we need better than that.Not everything about this Rankin Bass version is perfect either: aside from the animation and some non-English actors voicing some of the characters, not all of the songs are great (and none of them are found in Mr. Grahame's book, at least not as songs), and the animation is what you'd expect from Rankin Bass.  Plus this seems to be modernized--there's a car with a key and ignition, for example, instead of a crank (the former of which makes it harder to steal a car).So why do I think this may be the best?Well, ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" is left in, although rewritten and rearranged--but this doesn't necessarily matter as long as the themes and tone remain faithful and of good quality, and the plot and pacing are done well.  The biggest flaw of omission is leaving out Chapter 5, ""Dulce Domum"", entirely--there are nods to it but this makes it worse.  As to the end, Mr. Toad at least halfway reforms--at worst, ""modesty"" has become his new fad--and during the end credits we see the reconciliation with the Wild Wooders.  Perhaps having the longest running time has something to do with it: there is more time for everything without either making too many cuts or rushing the pacing--the latter of which would be innately wrong for this story and the former can be a problem if they're the wrong cuts.To sum up, I think the plot of this movie was written well.  It isn't entirely faithful to the book, but I don't think that matters--themes and tone matter more than plot in the book itself anyway.  After all, the closest thing to a plot thread tying the entire book together is the Mr. Toad chapters, but for the most part those don't get underway until Chapter 6 (of 12), and even then they're interrupted.  And the most important chapter, ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"", which provided the title of the story and the original cover of the book, is unrelated plotwise to any other chapter--it is only in terms of themes and tone that this chapter delves the most deeply into things found more superficially in other chapters, hence why this is called ""The Wind in the Willows"".Plotwise, what they did with this film was basically flip back and forth between two plot threads: the Mr. Toad plotline, and literally everything else that makes it clearer as to why this is called ""The Wind in the Willows"".  Even though they took creative liberties, I think they did a good job with the writing and pacing.  For example, although ""Wayfarers All"" is placed differently than in the book, and is combined with ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" (and Portly is now Badger's nephew instead of Otter's son, Otter having been cut out--but as Portly has no lines and isn't really a character this hardly matters), it is clearly tied in with what came before and after in a way that wasn't as clear in the book.  For example, Ratty says he's getting restless partly because (in addition to Mr. Toad being in jail), Mr. Mole is coming into his own and doesn't need Ratty as much anymore.  And Ratty finds Portly, hence why he doesn't follow the Seafaring Rat in the end--and we first see this when Mr. Mole finds them both, having followed the Piper's panpipes.  And right after this, Badger arrives and has found Mr. Toad, combining all of these theme-wise (and specifically making reference to ""the wind in the willows""), and also setting things up for the equivalent of Chapter 11, the penultimate chapter of the book.  This makes it a nice climax/resolution to that thread, so that all that is left is getting Toad Hall back, the climax and resolution of the other thread.Better still, we were set up for this earlier in the film: in Badger's house, Badger first talks of the Piper in the context of his watching over all animals, so that Ratty and Mr. Mole needn't worry so much about leaving the Wild Wood.  Given that Portly has been made Badger's nephew (understandable since Otter is a secondary character, less prominent, in the book), it makes sense that Badger would say this, especially combined with his speech with Mr. Toad in trying to cure the latter of his addiction to motorcars.  Here, that speech, especially when he says ""REPENT!""--combined with his belief in Pan--makes him sound like a religious sort, a holy man.  I wouldn't have thought this of Mr. Badger who ""hates company"", but given what is actually in the book, it's not so much of a stretch.  Certainly this speech is in the book, and they speak of ""converting"" Toad.  And certainly no one messes with Badger, not even in the Wild Wood.  In other words, while there is no precedent for this in the book, I can't bring myself to call it unfaithful, more like an idea never realized in the book but not incompatible therewith.  Here again I consider that good writing.To reiterate, I think the script is well-written and well-paced, so that not only are both threads given more or less equal time but it's paced well, it transitions well.  And given the liberties taken, things are set up well for their respective climaces and resolutions, and it's easier to keep track of everything that's going on in the story.  Plus things are set up and then resolved, just as in the book (if written differently)--all of this amounts to excellent writing and a love of the book that may not be as clear given just how many liberties were taken with the superficials.  In addition to this, the theme song sung by Judy Collins (and played on the pipes) rivals the theme song of the Cosgrove Hall TV series (the tune for which is in the film in instrumental form) for sheer beauty and appropriateness to this story.In short, while this is less accurate than the John Coates version, 1) exact accuracy doesn't matter quite so much where this story is concerned, as long as the themes and tone remain intact, and this film had that, and more importantly 2) the Rankin Bass version is better paced and easier to keep track of everything.  And while this may have less of the proper tone overall than the Cosgrove Hall version (and again, tone and themes matter more than exact plot, even though this is well-written given the liberties taken with it), 1) the tone and themes are still there in good quality form, and worked well into the plot, making for better cinema than a straighter adaptation of the book could have done, and 2) aside from the fact that they didn't cut out as much as the Cosgrove Hall version, and managed to work it in so that this film didn't feel overstuffed, the ending to the Rankin Bass version is better--it doesn't miss the point of the story entirely, even if Mr. Toad only half-reforms--and the ending is the last chance you have to make a lasting impression.In short, the tone and themes are kept (which is most important), the writing is excellently done in terms of adapting the book to movie form even despite the liberties taken (and the exact plot wasn't the most important thing in the book anyway), the ending is right, and the theme song is excellent.Ultimately what this means, though, is not that this is the definitive adaptation, or that you shouldn't watch either of the other two.  Not only is the Cosgrove Hall version better for overall tone, but it's more properly 1908 English than Rankin Bass could offer us.  And not only is the John Coates version more accurate, but the expressions on the characters' faces are not to be missed (and cannot be offered with stop-motion animation, nor the unique Rankin Bass animation).  I simply think these are good criteria for ranking the films given the book, and based on that, I think this Rankin Bass version is just a bit better than the other two, for all its flaws and for all their merits.But why not watch them all and decide for yourself?God bless you all.",4,Best adaptation?,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,11391,"['********THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS',
