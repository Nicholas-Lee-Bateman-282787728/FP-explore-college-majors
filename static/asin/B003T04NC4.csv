1361758,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003T04NC4,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Fragile is about an evil female ghost that haunts a childrens hospital. That's about it.I have to say, the presentation is absolutely fantastic. Watching this movie reminded me of the creepiest hospitals of the video game series Silent Hill (especially in the very first SH game- you simply MUST explore the endless amount of freakiness that dominates that particular hospital!).Fragile surprised me with a few other interesting features.  The widescreen view really elevated the greatness of the unnerving suspense.  It also made the atmosphere more enjoyable.  I suppose my one complaint is that I chose to watch this movie in the middle of the afternoon.  Had I known it was *this* good I would have waited until nightfall.Anyway, I had mixed feelings with the storyline at first. I mean come on, it's about sick children having to put up with a persistently violent ghost, and having this one nurse (the star of the movie) constantly coming in and making sure they're able to fall asleep peacefully without any disturbances involving the ghost. It's enticing yes, *certainly* enticing, but at the expense of sick kids? Well, I was able to overlook the inclusion of sick children as the film rolled along.There's a semi-scary elevator segment that's quite spectacular to watch. Sure, it's nothing particularly amazing that you probably haven't already seen in several other suspense or horror movies involving elevators that suddenly stop functioning, but it's pretty good nonetheless.I absolutely *loved* whenever the nurse would visit the hospital room where the sick children were sleeping. The atmosphere was incredibly thick and worked like a thing of beauty. It reminded me of the Grunge quite a bit.  Terribly disturbing things happen, and they always happen just when you're looking for some terrifying surprises.  Excellent writing.The only reason I'm not giving Fragile 5 perfect stars is because the storyline is very very basic. I expected something a bit more in the way of complexity, and well, I suppose it was full of twists and turns (especially the ending- a SHOCKING ending I must say- without spoiling what happens) but I was quite impressed with every other aspect.

Gore is NOT scary:  it's simply sickening.  This film is far above today's typical horror/ghost movie.  Amy (Calista Flockhart) is a nurse hired for the night shift at a children's hospital which is soon to be closed.  Most of the children have already been moved to another facility but Amy befriends Maggie, a troubled young girl, who the others claim can be difficult.  Maggie tells Amy that Charlotte--whom she refers to as the 'mechanical girl'-- lives on the closed second floor and it soon becomes evident that Maggie is afraid of Charlotte.'Fragile' is eerie and creepy from beginning to end, with very little gore and lots of frightening and haunting elements.  The ending has an unexpected twist concerning the identity of the 'mechanical girl', along with a touching element taken straight from the story of 'Sleeping Beauty.'Calista Flockhart turns in a great performance as the Nurse Amy, who comes to the story with a troubled past.  Yasmin Murphy, the beautiful youngster playing Maggie surely has a great future in the movies.  I was surprised to see Ivana Boquero, the young star of 'Pan's Labyrinth' in a small, non-speaking, but very crucial role.

1361766,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003T04NC4,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","FRAGILE (Fr&agrave;giles) is a terrific dark scary creepy atmospheric intelligent ghost story. Made in 2005 and released as an episode film in the Fangoria Frightfest, this decent film was overlooked in the theaters but deserves more attention now that it is available on DVD - allowing it to be viewed in the safety of the home!  The story is written by Jordi Galceran and writer/director Jaume Balaguer&oacute;  who demonstrate a rather sophisticated knowledge of a little known malady called Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a genetic disorder that makes the bones very brittle and easily (and frequently) broken.The story begins on a foggy dark night as temp nurse Amy Nicholls (Calista Flockhart) steps off the ferry onto an island to fill in for a children's hospital that has been condemned but must keep one floor open until the island's other hospital recovers form over crowding following a significant accident.  She is met by the kindly Roy (Colin McFarlane) who escorts her to the dilapidated hospital where the administrator Mrs. Folder (Gemma Jones) takes her on a tour, explaining that the second floor is sealed and has been for some years, and introduces her to the day nurse Helen Perez (Elena Anaya) who in turn introduces Amy to the eight children, all with significant illnesses, who will be under her care.  There is one child - Maggie (Yasmin Murphy) who keeps to herself and is obviously terrified, her closest friend had been the nurse Amy is replacing.  Amy and Maggie bond and this bond serves as the thread that opens the doors to the terrifying mysteries of the hospital.  Noises are heard after lights out and Amy gradually learns form Maggie about the 'mechanical girl' who somehow influences the activities of the hospital.  There is a doctor assigned to Amy's ward - Dr. Robert Marcus (Richard Roxburgh) - who assists Amy and the children.  But Amy must find out if the fears Maggie has are founded and so she visits two old ladies (Freda Dowie and Matyelek Gibbs) who inform Amy of the story of one child and nurse who could be the connection tot he terror: the child had osteogenesis imperfecta and her ghost remains present in the hospital. Once Amy discovers this information she shares it with Dr. Marcus and the two face the decision as to how to manage the increasingly terrifying events at the hospital.Calista Lockhart, the fine Australian actor Richard Roxburgh, the always excellent Gema Jones, and the surprising debut of young Yasmin Murphy make this film work.  Their performances are top notch, and the cinematography by Xavi Gim&eacute;nez and the musical score by Roque Ba&ntilde;os maintain an atmosphere of terror that is credible and keeps the audience on the edge of the seat.  Give this little film a chance- it is much better than the other films in this series!

The opening scenes with a particularly prescient orphan named Maggie (Yasmin Murphy) set the audience up for the spookiness to follow. Apparently, mysterious broken bones are not the only things to haunt this hospital.Spanish writer/director Jaume Balaguero wastes no time, presenting the audience with thunder, lightning, vibrating drinking glasses, and messages spelled out with children's blocks by an unseen presence. Nurse Amy is remote, neurotic, and using some type of medication--emotional problems, perhaps? After a terrifying episode in a renegade elevator, she doubles the dose of capsules from a maddeningly anonymous bottle.Children in the hospital refer to a mechanical girl--Charlotte--who ""lives"" on the second floor, which was abandoned 40 years ago. Just as the audience begins to question why these children, who seem healthy, are hospitalized, it is revealed that Maggie has cystic fibrosis.Amy's predecessor left her position at the hospital suddenly, and when Amy visits her home to question her about some suspicious happenings, she learns that the nurse had died in a car accident the previous day. Soon Amy, who is haunted by her own ghosts, begins seeing the manifestations the children have witnessed and that the staff either denies or ignores.The cast is well able to handle this familiar, yet creepy, tale that examines both emotional and spiritual haunting.

1361773,A387BD735MI50R,B003T04NC4,R. Schultz,"[0, 1]","This movie doesn't break any new ground in the ghost story genre. But it's scary enough. Its portentous gloom reveals its secrets in taut rubber-band pieces that snap back at you - as you know they must. But you never know exactly when or where you'll get hit.Calista Flockhart plays her part pretty much on one note - the note of haunted melancholy. She looks haunted even as she arrives on this misty island off the coast of England to assume her role as nurse at a children's hospital. However in the Director's Commentary included on this DVD, the Director points out that there's a reason for her to be suppressed and apprehensive from the start, and that reason comprises a second mystery for the film to unfold.The film's conclusion doesn't quite jibe with the manifestations that terrorize the remaining children and staff in this closing hospital. But you can't demand strict logic from a ghost.My main disappointment with the movie is that it wasn't filmed in a real abandoned hospital. I got this DVD hoping that some authentic old, crumbling hospital would be used as the setting for the haunting and would become as much a character in the film as the old, closed Danvers State Mental Hospital became in the truly terrifying movie ""Session 9.""However the ""hospital"" used here is clearly a combination of stage set and CGI creation. In the commentary, the Director explains that a real abandoned English boarding school was used as the faade of the presumed hospital that Flockhart was approaching. However they couldn't find or afford any suitable interior for the haunting itself, so they had to build one. That's too bad, because a ghost is so much an emanation from its original surroundings that it can't be transplanted into just any prepared bedding. The location scout for this film should perhaps have come to Chicago to consider the vast old Victorian Cook County Hospital, abandoned for years now, as a setting for the film. Or maybe the movie crew was afraid it would find too many real ghosts waiting for them in such a place.",4,Scary Enough,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,2051,"['movie', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'ghost', 'story', 'genre', 'scary', 'enough', 'portentous', 'gloom', 'secrets', 'taut', 'rubber-band', 'pieces', 'snap', 'back', 'know', 'must', 'never', 'know', 'exactly', 'when', 'where', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hit.Calista', 'Flockhart', 'part', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'note', 'note', 'haunted', 'melancholy', 'haunted', 'even', 'misty', 'island', 'coast', 'England', 'assume', 'role', 'nurse', 'children', 'hospital', 'However', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'included', 'DVD', 'Director', 'points', 'out', 'reason', 'be', 'suppressed', 'apprehensive', 'start', 'reason', 'second', 'mystery', 'film', 'unfold.The', 'film', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'quite', 'jibe', 'manifestations', 'terrorize', 'remaining', 'children', 'staff', 'closing', 'hospital', 'ca', ""n't"", 'demand', 'strict', 'logic', 'ghost.My', 'main', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'filmed', 'real', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'got', 'DVD', 'hoping', 'authentic', 'old', 'crumbling', 'hospital', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'setting', 'haunting', 'would', 'become', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'film', 'old', 'closed', 'Danvers', 'State', 'Mental', 'Hospital', 'became', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'movie', 'Session', '9', 'However', 'hospital', 'used', 'here', 'clearly', 'combination', 'stage', 'set', 'CGI', 'creation', 'commentary', 'Director', 'real', 'abandoned', 'English', 'boarding', 'school', 'was', 'used', 'faade', 'presumed', 'hospital', 'Flockhart', 'was', 'approaching', 'However', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'afford', 'suitable', 'interior', 'haunting', 'so', 'had', 'build', 'one', 'too', 'bad', 'ghost', 'so', 'much', 'emanation', 'original', 'surroundings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'transplanted', 'just', 'prepared', 'bedding', 'location', 'scout', 'film', 'should', 'perhaps', 'have', 'come', 'Chicago', 'consider', 'vast', 'old', 'Victorian', 'Cook', 'County', 'Hospital', 'abandoned', 'years', 'now', 'setting', 'film', 'maybe', 'movie', 'crew', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'find', 'too', 'many', 'real', 'ghosts', 'waiting', 'place']",N/A

It's a strange movie that takes place in a decrepit children's hospital off the coast of England. The hospital is about to go out of business, when weird occurrences start taking place, leaving them short staffed. To fill the void, they hire an American nurse who quickly realizes that something at this hospital is very wrong. This film was very creepy, especially at the end, but it wasn't particularly exciting. It's extremely slow moving and tries to make a relevant point, but it's contrary to the whole premise of the film. The tagline states that the dead stay near the things they love, but in this film the dead are terrorizing what they supposedly love. As for the acting, it was pretty good despite the fact that half the cast were just kids. I admit that I did like parts of this movie, but others are extremely weird and disturbing, not to mention I almost fell asleep a couple times.

The tale starts with a child finding himself injured and with no one to explain this hurt, and the tale gets darker from here. Apparently this thing, whatever it is, has been talked about for years in the hospital and things have been getting worse lately. It corresponds with a move that is taking place form this hospital to another, and it seems to get worse as time progresses. One nurse quits over this, too, frightened by something she has seen and the kids talk about seeing a girl, a mechanical girl, that lives on an abandoned floor of the hospital.Of all the Fangoria movies, this had to be the most frightening. There were parts in it that actually dug their way into you spine and made you shiver, and I personally didn't expect that. What I expected was what many of the others gave you, a campy experience that reminded me of something I might have seen when I was younger, but no. This was the one movie I can say that actually made me feel like I was watching some true horror.What made this movie were the setting, the atmosphere, the way everything was set up, and the actors. The setting was a hospital that looked like a horrible place with lots of bad memories, and the movie plays off this. It creates a great background and this place delivers even more as the world grows dark. The people in the place act well, too, and this is a great thing considering how you are counting on children to do the things that they sometimes miss out on. Here, there do it grand. And, finally, there is the story.While you think you know what is going on really quickly, you do not. It has a great twist at the end that is twisted and turned, and this made me think ""that was great"" when I finished. I expected the very ending to be more dark but that did not come out, but the way the whole of the chase leveled out more than made up for it. Really, with the cost of these movies not being much it really made up for the way things were.I have to give this movie a high grade because, really, it was worth the time I spent wathcing it.",5,In a building that breaks things,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,2105,"['children', 'hosptial', 'many', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'goign', 'wrong', 'tale', 'child', 'finding', 'injured', 'one', 'explain', 'hurt', 'tale', 'darker', 'here', 'Apparently', 'thing', 'whatever', 'been', 'talked', 'years', 'hospital', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'getting', 'worse', 'lately', 'move', 'taking', 'place', 'form', 'hospital', 'get', 'worse', 'time', 'One', 'nurse', 'too', 'frightened', 'something', 'seen', 'kids', 'talk', 'seeing', 'girl', 'mechanical', 'girl', 'abandoned', 'floor', 'hospital.Of', 'Fangoria', 'movies', 'had', 'be', 'most', 'frightening', 'were', 'parts', 'actually', 'dug', 'way', 'spine', 'made', 'shiver', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'What', 'expected', 'was', 'what', 'many', 'others', 'gave', 'campy', 'experience', 'reminded', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'was', 'one', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'actually', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'true', 'horror.What', 'made', 'movie', 'were', 'setting', 'atmosphere', 'way', 'everything', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'actors', 'setting', 'was', 'hospital', 'looked', 'horrible', 'place', 'lots', 'bad', 'memories', 'movie', 'great', 'background', 'place', 'even', 'more', 'world', 'dark', 'people', 'place', 'act', 'well', 'too', 'great', 'thing', 'considering', 'how', 'are', 'counting', 'children', 'do', 'things', 'sometimes', 'miss', 'out', 'Here', 'do', 'grand', 'finally', 'story.While', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'really', 'quickly', 'do', 'not', 'great', 'twist', 'end', 'twisted', 'turned', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'when', 'finished', 'expected', 'very', 'ending', 'be', 'more', 'dark', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'way', 'whole', 'chase', 'leveled', 'out', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'Really', 'cost', 'movies', 'not', 'being', 'much', 'really', 'made', 'up', 'way', 'things', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'grade', 'really', 'was', 'time', 'spent', 'wathcing']",N/A

Though the storyline is a bit predictable, there are enough chills and plot twists to make this a compelling horror movie. Calista Flockhart plays Amy Nicholls, who takes on the job of night nurse at a remote children's hospital somewhere in England. Her predecessor had apparently left the job suddenly, and it soon becomes clear to Amy why this is so. There are mysterious goings-on at this children's hospital - the forbidding Gothic structure, the sealed-off second floor (which has been closed since the late 50s), unexplained injuries afflicting the young patients, and a strange little girl named Maggie who forms a close bond with Amy. Amy soon learns that a malevolent spirit is haunting the hospital, refusing to let the children leave (the authorities are in the process of evacuating the children from the run-down hospital) and the children have dubbed this spirit the ""mechanical"" girl. As Amy digs deeper, she learns the true nature of the haunting, a result of events played out several decades earlier. But will Amy manage to save the children before it is too late?The cast does a credible job in their roles. Flockhart plays the night nurse with a measure of credibility. Plagued by demons of her own, Amy is quite a mess psychologically, yet tries her best to hold on to sanity as she works to help the children, especially the vulnerable Maggie who seems to be the central focus of the spirit. Then there's the cynical male doctor, Marcus (Richard Roxburgh) who tries to find a rational explanation for the strange events plaguing the hospital, until later events convince him otherwise. Gemma Jones (who has played some prominent roles in British period dramas such asSense & Sensibility (Special Edition)andThe Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection) plays the stern Mrs. Folder, who oversees the hospital, and knows more about the history of the hospital than the others. This movie will appeal to fans of atmospheric horror movies and those who love stories about haunted buildings.",4,Creepy ghost story with twists,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,2125,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'couple', 'Fangoria', 'Frightfest', 'movies', 'think', 'Fragile', 'one', 'better', 'offerings', 'storyline', 'bit', 'predictable', 'are', 'enough', 'chills', 'plot', 'twists', 'make', 'compelling', 'horror', 'movie', 'Calista', 'Flockhart', 'Amy', 'Nicholls', 'who', 'job', 'night', 'nurse', 'remote', 'children', 'hospital', 'somewhere', 'England', 'predecessor', 'had', 'apparently', 'left', 'job', 'suddenly', 'soon', 'clear', 'Amy', 'why', 'so', 'are', 'mysterious', 'goings-on', 'children', 'hospital', 'forbidding', 'Gothic', 'structure', 'sealed-off', 'second', 'floor', 'been', 'closed', 'late', '50s', 'unexplained', 'injuries', 'afflicting', 'young', 'patients', 'strange', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Maggie', 'who', 'close', 'bond', 'Amy', 'Amy', 'soon', 'malevolent', 'spirit', 'haunting', 'hospital', 'refusing', 'let', 'children', 'leave', 'authorities', 'are', 'process', 'evacuating', 'children', 'run-down', 'hospital', 'children', 'have', 'dubbed', 'mechanical', 'girl', 'Amy', 'deeper', 'true', 'nature', 'haunting', 'result', 'events', 'played', 'out', 'several', 'decades', 'earlier', 'will', 'Amy', 'manage', 'save', 'children', 'too', 'late', 'cast', 'credible', 'job', 'roles', 'Flockhart', 'night', 'nurse', 'measure', 'credibility', 'Plagued', 'demons', 'own', 'Amy', 'quite', 'mess', 'psychologically', 'yet', 'best', 'hold', 'sanity', 'help', 'children', 'especially', 'vulnerable', 'Maggie', 'who', 'be', 'central', 'focus', 'spirit', 'Then', 'cynical', 'male', 'doctor', 'Marcus', 'Richard', 'Roxburgh', 'who', 'find', 'rational', 'explanation', 'strange', 'events', 'plaguing', 'hospital', 'later', 'events', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'who', 'played', 'prominent', 'roles', 'British', 'period', 'dramas', 'such', 'asSense', 'Sensibility', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Duchess', 'Duke', 'Street', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'stern', 'Mrs.', 'Folder', 'who', 'hospital', 'more', 'history', 'hospital', 'others', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'movies', 'who', 'love', 'stories', 'haunted', 'buildings']",N/A
