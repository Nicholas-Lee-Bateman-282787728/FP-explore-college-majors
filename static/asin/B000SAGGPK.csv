1085833,AL2P8N1XIYBLM,B000SAGGPK,Casey C. Corpier,"[1, 2]","Did anyone catch that last Pirates of the Caribbean Movie. I still haven't checked it out yet. The unfortunate truth is I loved the first one but I really hated the second so I'm hoping that the third makes up for it. I don't know he truth is I liked it better when the bad Pirates all looked like dead ghosts and not like fish people, You see what happens when Disney takes over a project next thing you know you have talking animals and so forth.Anyway I checked out a recent flick that my good friend Kristin wrote for a small production company that got distribution from Lionsgate that is the exact opposite of the recent series of Johnny Depp pirate adventures...Ok it flat out parodies them. I'm talking about Pirates of Ghost IslandWhat we have here Kiddies is the story of a group of marooned college graduates that are all trapped on an island that is inhabited by the ghosts of a group of Pirates that are eating anyone that happens to step foot on the island. What is different about this group is the fact that one of the girls is the reincarnation/descendant of the head pirate's wife and h wants her back. think of the Mummy with Pirates.Now as far as the movie goes I like the story and the script. The dialogue was cheesy and campy but for a film like this it is intended to be. does anyone remember a flick from the 1960s called A monster in the Surf well not really any of you people but the guys that I know will remember it. I feel that this movie was made for the lovers of the cheesy B-Movie Lovers like me that like cheesy dialogue as well as hot girls in Bikinis and low prices sets and stock footage. I feel that Kristin knew what she was writing when she was asked to pen the script. I know that she took allot of heat from some critics but the critics that reviewed her I don't think would know a decent movie if it was right in front of them...That and they just wanted to see [...]. To that I say Get a girlfriend you losers. Or at least a decent girl and not some of those Skanks that you like to keep aroundNow the acting was pretty bad but once again I feel that that was the intent. You see kiddies I think that the filmmakers knew that with a movie with the word Pirates in the title they would naturally be compared to that movie based on a theme Park Ride and went the opposite direction and made a campy cheesy 0 budget flick that is good for one thing entertaining you.Unfortunately films like this are never appreciated Ed Wood Jr is often hailed as the worst filmmaker of all time and his flick Plan 9 from Outer Space has the mention for being seen as the worst movie of all time, I mean come on there are plenty worst than that. Did anyone see Battlefield Earth?...I rest my case.10 Dead Bodies0 Breasts (allot of hot girls in Bikinis)3 BeastsPirate GhostsSamari GhostsSailor GhostsVoodoo Headhunting Ghosts1 Talking IslandBad timing for an argumentAttacking bushHeads RollArms RollHuman Fuand Pirate Fu2  StarsB-Movie fans Check it out",2,Good for B Movie Fans,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,2979,"['Did', 'anyone', 'catch', 'last', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Movie', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'checked', 'out', 'yet', 'unfortunate', 'truth', 'loved', 'first', 'one', 'really', 'hated', 'second', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'third', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'liked', 'better', 'when', 'bad', 'Pirates', 'looked', 'dead', 'ghosts', 'not', 'fish', 'people', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'Disney', 'project', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'have', 'talking', 'animals', 'so', 'forth.Anyway', 'checked', 'out', 'recent', 'flick', 'good', 'friend', 'Kristin', 'wrote', 'small', 'production', 'company', 'got', 'distribution', 'Lionsgate', 'exact', 'opposite', 'recent', 'series', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'pirate', 'adventures', 'flat', 'out', 'parodies', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Pirates', 'Ghost', 'IslandWhat', 'have', 'here', 'Kiddies', 'story', 'group', 'marooned', 'college', 'graduates', 'are', 'trapped', 'island', 'inhabited', 'ghosts', 'group', 'Pirates', 'are', 'eating', 'anyone', 'step', 'foot', 'island', 'What', 'different', 'group', 'fact', 'one', 'girls', 'reincarnation/descendant', 'head', 'pirate', 'wife', 'h', 'back', 'think', 'Mummy', 'Pirates.Now', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'story', 'script', 'dialogue', 'was', 'cheesy', 'campy', 'film', 'intended', 'be', 'anyone', 'remember', 'flick', '1960s', 'called', 'monster', 'Surf', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'people', 'guys', 'know', 'will', 'remember', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'lovers', 'cheesy', 'B-Movie', 'Lovers', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'hot', 'girls', 'Bikinis', 'low', 'prices', 'sets', 'stock', 'footage', 'feel', 'Kristin', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'writing', 'when', 'was', 'asked', 'pen', 'script', 'know', 'took', 'allot', 'heat', 'critics', 'critics', 'reviewed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'know', 'decent', 'movie', 'was', 'right', 'front', 'just', 'wanted', 'see', '[', ']', 'say', 'Get', 'girlfriend', 'losers', 'least', 'decent', 'girl', 'not', 'Skanks', 'like', 'keep', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'once', 'again', 'feel', 'was', 'intent', 'see', 'kiddies', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'knew', 'movie', 'word', 'title', 'would', 'naturally', 'be', 'compared', 'movie', 'based', 'theme', 'Park', 'Ride', 'went', 'opposite', 'direction', 'made', 'campy', 'cheesy', '0', 'budget', 'flick', 'good', 'one', 'thing', 'entertaining', 'you.Unfortunately', 'films', 'are', 'never', 'appreciated', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Jr', 'often', 'hailed', 'worst', 'filmmaker', 'time', 'flick', 'Plan', '9', 'Outer', 'Space', 'mention', 'being', 'seen', 'worst', 'movie', 'time', 'mean', 'come', 'are', 'plenty', 'worst', 'Did', 'anyone', 'see', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'rest', 'case.10', 'Dead', 'Bodies0', 'Breasts', 'allot', 'hot', 'girls', 'Bikinis', '3', 'BeastsPirate', 'GhostsSamari', 'GhostsSailor', 'GhostsVoodoo', 'Headhunting', 'Ghosts1', 'Talking', 'IslandBad', 'timing', 'argumentAttacking', 'bushHeads', 'RollArms', 'RollHuman', 'Fuand', 'Pirate', 'Fu2', 'StarsB-Movie', 'fans', 'Check', 'out']",Pirates Of Ghost Island

1085838,A7D607LPOKWYD,B000SAGGPK,TJ Brown,"[0, 0]","This was a strange ride. In the first couple of minutes I was not sure what I stumbled upon, it reminded me of home videos my drunken friends had made. I even thought someone slipped a gag gift into the DVD case. Then I started to pick up on what was going on here, and for that it was fine. It was done for camp. No one was taking anything seriously here. Everything was blown up for bombasity. There were some tremendous lines delivered in deadpan style, wacky costumes, and performers running around on a beach seemingly having a lark.At times with the pirates on the screen I felt like I was at the local Renaissance Fair. This is not a bad thing. I enjoyed the pirates, I enjoyed the other ramdom entities haunting the Island, and I enjoyed seeing characters i did not like for one reason or another being done away with. A couple of grumbling points - the blood did not just look silly, it was annoyingly so. Like 1st grade play Ceasar just got stabbed quality. Some of the ""special effects""  - even though i think that were done for camp, were sketchy enough to miss the mark.Bottom line, I enjoyed the movie. I laughed out loud a couple of times, which scores it points. And there were at least half a dozen cheesy lines that not only will I not forget, I will randomly blurt them out to either impress or annoy my friends.  I mean, someone actually exclaims, """"Holy double-s**t!  -  a cannibalistic pirate, combined with an immortal demon?  What a nightmare!""So take this for what it is, good fun. Its not scary, its not particularly gory (unless you freak out at slasher comedy) and has some funny lines.  And goofy folks dressed as Pirates seemingly having the time of their lives, and women running around in bikinis too.
