455012,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,6305226938,&#308;&#308;,"[0, 0]","Paula Abdul leads in this workout, and I believe that she choreographed it, as well.  It's broken down into a warm-up, a workout, a toning segment/cool-down.Warm-Up-Paula does a short routine, but she doesn't explain any moves.  She just says,""Let's do the 'bus stop'!"" and she does the move expecting the viewer to be able to follow along.  She then goes into a little bit of stretching.Workout-Paula has 6 main steps in her routine, and she breaks down the workout by teaching 2 at a time.  She doesn't really explain the steps, but she shows them multiple times.  She'll demonstrate once slowly, once medium, once fast, and about three times really fast.  She does this with each move.  I was able to learn the steps by watching the slow part several times (by rewinding), but a beginner might have more trouble following along.  The dance style is kind of a hip-hop and jazz mixture.  I liked the choreography, and I found this to be a good cardio workout.Toning/Cooldown-Paula starts this segment doing toning, but she ends with some stretching.  Paula's toning method is basically plies.  Constant plies.  She does do a few calf raises, and a few lunge pulses, but mostly it is plies.  After she works your legs, she does a fabulous stretch segment that stretches pretty much everything.  It is very relaxing.I like this DVD, but it is a challenge to learn.  I don't do it very often, but when I want something unique and funky, I pull this out.  Beginner exercisers will find it too hard, but advanced exercisers won't find it cardio enough.  Intermediate exercisers, however, will probably like this DVD, assuming they have a dance background.",4,Pretty good dance workout,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,1651,"['Paula', 'Abdul', 'workout', 'believe', 'choreographed', 'as', 'well', 'broken', 'down', 'warm-up', 'workout', 'toning', 'segment/cool-down.Warm-Up-Paula', 'short', 'routine', ""n't"", 'explain', 'moves', 'just', 'Let', 'do', ""'bus"", 'stop', 'move', 'expecting', 'viewer', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'then', 'little', 'bit', 'stretching.Workout-Paula', '6', 'main', 'steps', 'routine', 'down', 'workout', 'teaching', '2', 'time', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'steps', 'multiple', 'times', ""'ll"", 'demonstrate', 'once', 'slowly', 'once', 'medium', 'once', 'fast', 'three', 'times', 'really', 'fast', 'move', 'was', 'able', 'learn', 'steps', 'watching', 'slow', 'part', 'several', 'times', 'rewinding', 'beginner', 'might', 'have', 'more', 'trouble', 'following', 'along', 'dance', 'style', 'kind', 'hip-hop', 'jazz', 'mixture', 'liked', 'choreography', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'cardio', 'workout.Toning/Cooldown-Paula', 'segment', 'doing', 'toning', 'stretching', 'Paula', 'toning', 'method', 'basically', 'plies', 'Constant', 'plies', 'do', 'few', 'calf', 'raises', 'few', 'lunge', 'pulses', 'mostly', 'plies', 'legs', 'fabulous', 'stretch', 'segment', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'very', 'relaxing.I', 'DVD', 'challenge', 'learn', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'often', 'when', 'want', 'something', 'unique', 'funky', 'pull', 'out', 'Beginner', 'exercisers', 'will', 'find', 'too', 'hard', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'cardio', 'enough', 'Intermediate', 'exercisers', 'however', 'will', 'probably', 'DVD', 'assuming', 'have', 'dance', 'background']",Paula Abdul - Cardio Dance VHS

Paula Abdul really gets your heartrate going, and she is great company to sweat with.At first the dance moves DO seem a bit complex but they are easily mastered and really work your body out.  What I like the most is that the warm-up is quick and effective, then Ms. Paula takes you right into the dancing.  And how-these are some real funky moves!  She takes it slow(and uses an inset box which I find useless), and after a few times you'll get it.  If anyone expect to pop in an excerise tape and have to routine after only 5 minutes-you have got another thing coming.After the dance routine, Paula does some real great toning and stretching.  The workout really burns in you legs and thighs(hey-it's that &quot;good&quot; burn), and the stretching feels fantastic for you back and legs.If you consider yourself a beginner try Paula's first tape &quot;Get Up And Dance&quot;.

Paula performs this workout in a dance studio with 2 male and 2 female dancers at her sides. It takes place in 3 parts:The Warm-up-This is a fun, dancy warm-up which consists of combinations of less challenging dance moves to get you loosened up and ready for the full workout. Paula is playful and energetic, and though the dancers are quiet, they're focused and talented and after awhile, the warm-up starts to feel as effortless and fun as the 5 of them are making it look.The Dance Routine-Paula's workouts have a unique style of dance where you learn each step slowly. The dancers face you at the top of the screen and there's a dialog box at the bottom of the screen which features Paula facing the same way you are (to prevent your hands and feet from getting all mixed up trying to follow along :) It's a great helper!). The steps are funky (though not too difficult for the inexperienced and not too easy/boring for the trained dancers) and they each have their own signature (ie: the 'strut' and the 'military groove') As you perform that step in repetition a couple of times and it gets more comfortable, the music starts to get a little faster each repetition until you're up to the final speed. In this workout, there are 3 sections with 2 steps each, and you practice the sections seperately until finally putting them together for one longer string of steps at the end at full speed. It's very enjoyable and gets your heart rate up for what I believe to be the most challenging portion of the DVD...Stretching & Toning-Oh boy, this section makes you work hard! You start with a nice, relaxing cool down and then move into a variety of toning exercise for your arms, legs, abs (just naturally, by holding your stomach in while you perform the exercises), and butt. They're very calming and soothing because the moves are slow, but they require a lot of balance and strength (ie: holding your arms out at second position for a very long time while doing different variations of pli'es and then working your arms at the same time when they're good and sore) :) It's terrific, you see and feel the results right away on these and you feel excellent about your workout by the end of the disc!I've had this workout dvd (including the video before it) for almost 10 years now, and I still haven't tired of it. It helps too, that even the hardest part of the disc is tackled in a soothing way. It somehow makes it easier to get my motivation up to begin the workout. I greatly recommend it to anyone hoping to put a little funk into their workout regime.

I mean, hey, she was a former Laker girl, for crying out loud. BUT, after only owning this DVD for two whole days, I've gotten the routine down....AND I like it!Paula Abdul is ever-known for her funky dance style, and she really expresses it in this workout video. Granted, the steps are really hard to follow when you try it out for the first time (like I felt yesterday). However, by the second or third time through, YOU FINALLY GET IT. And you get a decent cardio work out while doing it.More importantly, I think ""Cardio Dance"" emphasizes one component of fitness often overlooked by the fitness denizens of today: coordination! I notice when I take dance classes (including this DVD), I feel more nimble and able to tackle other workouts more effectively. Your stability and posture improve, not to mention your confidence.You may not sweat buckets doing this DVD, but you will improve your foot coordination and HAVE FUN! Paula's enthusiasm is great, and her program is well-choreographed.  The ballet-based toning exercises are good, focusing A LOT on ""plies"", lifts for your calves, and stretches to finish off.Keep in mind, it's easier to do this DVD on a non-carpeted floor (although not impossible on a carpet as long as you pick your feet up), and you will need a fair amount of room in which to follow the routine.",4,Something Tae Bo CAN'T do,1043107200,"01 21, 2003",2003,1438,"['can', 'understand', 'why', 'many', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'DVD', 'was', 'too', 'technically', 'difficult', 'follow', 'mean', 'hey', 'was', 'former', 'Laker', 'girl', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'BUT', 'only', 'owning', 'DVD', 'two', 'whole', 'days', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'routine', 'down', 'like', 'Paula', 'Abdul', 'ever-known', 'funky', 'dance', 'style', 'really', 'workout', 'video', 'Granted', 'steps', 'are', 'really', 'hard', 'follow', 'when', 'try', 'out', 'first', 'time', 'felt', 'yesterday', 'However', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'YOU', 'FINALLY', 'GET', 'IT', 'get', 'decent', 'cardio', 'work', 'out', 'doing', 'it.More', 'importantly', 'think', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'one', 'component', 'fitness', 'often', 'overlooked', 'fitness', 'denizens', 'today', 'coordination', 'notice', 'when', 'take', 'dance', 'classes', 'including', 'DVD', 'feel', 'more', 'nimble', 'able', 'tackle', 'other', 'workouts', 'more', 'effectively', 'stability', 'posture', 'improve', 'not', 'mention', 'confidence.You', 'may', 'not', 'sweat', 'buckets', 'doing', 'DVD', 'will', 'improve', 'foot', 'coordination', 'HAVE', 'FUN', 'Paula', 'enthusiasm', 'great', 'program', 'well-choreographed', 'ballet-based', 'toning', 'exercises', 'are', 'good', 'focusing', 'A', 'LOT', 'plies', 'lifts', 'calves', 'stretches', 'finish', 'off.Keep', 'mind', 'easier', 'do', 'DVD', 'non-carpeted', 'floor', 'not', 'impossible', 'carpet', 'as', 'long', 'pick', 'feet', 'up', 'will', 'need', 'fair', 'amount', 'room', 'follow', 'routine']",Paula Abdul - Cardio Dance VHS

It then moves to more dance steps taught a little more slowly.  It's not staying in my collection for three reasons:  1.)  It's impossible to do these routines unless you have a clear eight by ten space.  You can't do this in the space where you might do a step workout, yoga or pilates.  2.)  This is a relatively difficult set of dance steps.  (Which might be a positive, not a negative for some folks.)  3.)  These are not the kind of routines you can do in more conventional dance settings.  In recent years, hip hop and bellydance have garnered more interest from the general public because there are people teaching those particular forms of dance in ways that can be done in the small, socially conventional 2 by 2 space of a dance floor.These are very well done, floor eating dance routines that can't be used like that.Having said all of that, if you have a drill team, cheerleaders, drama club, or church group where large scale performances of more modern hip hop dance could be useful, and your students have some prior dance experience, this might be a go-to tape for practice.

It is in Paula's fun, funky style. However, she doesn't break it down real well.  It is fast to begin with, and gets faster. It needs to start out with 1/2 the tempo it began with. And in ""Get up..."", she does begin slow. However, at the beginning of each segment in Cardio Dance there is a box at the bottom of the screen so you can see what she's doing the same way she's facing.I found Cardio Dance to be a little more intimidating because the moves are sophisticated, I think, from my background in ballet and jazz.  It uses a lot more space- she uses a lot of the floor both horizontally and vertically. So you need a lot of room to ""travel"" across the floor so you can't do it in an itty-bitty living room.  Paula says that this workout is best not done on carpet as it could hurt your knees because there is a lot of lower leg twisting- salsa/mambo moves and turning- so no carpet in an itty-bitty living room either! So that was frusterating! Altogether it was fun, but I still like her other video which features ""everyday people"" as she calls them versus the professional dancers in Cardio Dance.  There is a 15 minute lower body toning section at the end that I like which includes a lot of plies and is her cool-down as well.",3,Funky & fun but frusterating,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,1383,"[""'m"", 'going', 'compare', 'video', 'Paula', 'other', 'video', 'Get', 'up', 'Dance', 'loved', 'Get', 'up', 'so', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'Paula', 'fun', 'funky', 'style', 'However', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'real', 'well', 'fast', 'begin', 'faster', 'start', 'out', '1/2', 'tempo', 'began', 'Get', 'up', 'begin', 'slow', 'However', 'beginning', 'segment', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'box', 'bottom', 'screen', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'same', 'way', 'facing.I', 'found', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'intimidating', 'moves', 'are', 'sophisticated', 'think', 'background', 'ballet', 'jazz', 'lot', 'more', 'space-', 'lot', 'floor', 'horizontally', 'vertically', 'need', 'lot', 'room', 'travel', 'floor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'itty-bitty', 'living', 'room', 'Paula', 'workout', 'best', 'not', 'done', 'carpet', 'could', 'hurt', 'knees', 'lot', 'lower', 'leg', 'twisting-', 'salsa/mambo', 'moves', 'turning-', 'so', 'carpet', 'itty-bitty', 'living', 'room', 'was', 'frusterating', 'was', 'fun', 'still', 'other', 'video', 'everyday', 'people', 'professional', 'dancers', 'Cardio', 'Dance', '15', 'minute', 'lower', 'body', 'toning', 'section', 'end', 'like', 'lot', 'plies', 'cool-down', 'well']",Paula Abdul - Cardio Dance VHS

Paula's other DVD ""Get up & dance"" breaks down steps & music to 3/4 speed 3x & then normal speed, but the dance moves were complex, but popular at the time like the George Jetson, etc. I had trouble with that one even.The music on this is very mixed/instrumental of Paula's songs that were very uninspiring. This is more complex in my opinion & and even less instruction & you need a lot of floor space. She barely cues & she shows you hand & leg movements at the same time. She does show sometimes her alone w/back to you in lower corner in 1/4 size screen & the upper left 2/3 her & her dancers facing you. I have a lot of other dance dvds that are easier to follow.
