Have you heard of ""the other movie""?""Capote"" came out in '05 and ""Infamous"", right behind it, in '06. That's been at the expense of ""Infamous"" and more importantly of the public- because ""Infamous"" is the better film. Since it came out a year after the well recieved and highly publicized ""Capote"" I guess America had enough Capote and had paid enough attention to the somehwhat grim story behind the creation of the novel ""In Cold Blood"".As far as ""Capote"" goes it's a good film and deserving of critical praise, especially of coarse for Philip Seymour Hoffman who ended up with an Oscar. He did about as good a job as any actor could in portraying the famous, ""eccentric""(lol) author.Hoffman did about as good a job as any could, except for one Toby Jones.Toby Jones is a talented actor and happens to be a Truman Capote look-a-like. It is uncanny, the physical resemblance. And on top of that Jones perfectly captures the voice Gore Vidal described as sounding what a Brussels Sprout would sound like if it could talk. He was as they say, born for part.Of coarse the films must be compared: They both have their strenghts and respective flaws or weaker aspects. But as many have said, they serve as great companion pieces -each offering a different perspective on a complex artist and the events surrounding the creation of his greatest work. What a unique and interesting situation to have two very well made films done at about the same time and on the same fascinating subject.The more entertaining -and at least as well acted film- is ""Infamous"", however. And after seeing Toby Jones as Truman Capote, Hoffman is just not as impressive.If you see ""Capote"" definitely don't fail to miss ""Infamous"".

It does draw a lot from the power of 'In Cold Blood' without being redundant to the classic movie chiller reinactment of a heinous heartland murder of an innocent family.  The film is focused, but it does retain the personal life of Capote.  It isn't a particularly flattering portrayal (although Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman certainly earned his place here), even though the unvarnished portrait isn't just a hack job--it exposes the man's vulnerabilities as well as his duplicity.  The movie shows a man of compassion with some strong human frailties to boot.  His personality comes through at cocktail parties and through his lifelong friendship with famed author Harper Lee (played with Oscar-nominated prowess by Katherine Keener).

966748,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000E33VWW,A Customer,"[2, 3]","The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences may as well just serve up Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar now, for without a doubt, his performance in Capote is the finest of the year. Hoffman becomes so absorbed in playing the famous author, that he's sure to have a lock on the admiration of viewers everywhere, and the gold statuette.He's nothing short of astonishing, and he never overly imitates the well known, and often mocked, speech patterns or mannerisms of the writer Truman Capote, but rather nails his essences without turning to parody. But the film itself is absolutely mesmerizing, a beautiful, subtle, and beguiling tale, of love and art and journalism; it's terrific movie that thoroughly deserves all the accolades.The film begins in the late '50s when Capote, fresh off the success of Breakfast at Tiffany's. He's now become part of the intellectual and artistic elite, a doyen of the salons and private parties of the Upper East Side and secure in his world and reputation as the New Yorker's best and brightest author.One afternoon he reads a short newspaper article in The New York Times about the slaying of a rural Kansas family, the Clutters. Something about the gravity of the murders captivates him, and Capote decides the topic is perfect for The New Yorker magazine, an article in which he will show the effect of such a brutal murder on the inhabitants of a small town.Within days he heads to the community of Holcomb, Kansas in the company of his boyhood chum, Harper Lee, (a fabulous Catherine Keener), soon to write her one and only novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee serves as his enabler, helping Capote ingratiate himself into the close-knit, and somewhat intolerant, community, as he attempts to make contact with the town's law enforcement professionals and, ultimately, the perpetrators of the deed.As the narrow minded law enforcement officials, led by Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) reluctantly give Capote information about the crime, the young reporter befriends one of the imprisoned convicts, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) in order to extract as much of his personal perspective about the killings as possible.But it's a relationship forged in dishonesty - it's the story and not the lives of the murderers that really compel the author - and whilst there's obviously an attraction there - they're both eccentric outsiders from the wrong side of the tracks - Capote is shown as ultimately more concerned about getting the story, as he does his best to postpone Perry's execution until he can get all the information that he needs. He must find out exactly what happened on that night in 1959, and he does such a good job of manipulating Perry's trust so that Perry believes he has a friend who will fight for his life.Director Bennett Miller, writer Dan Futterman, and most of all actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman capture this process with exquisite accuracy and with the smallest of flourishes. The genius of the film, besides Hoffman's stunning performance, is that it knows exactly how much is enough. It never overplays, lingers or punches up.The dialogue is intelligent; each scene is carefully laid out, with a gorgeously minimalist piano score that heightens the emotional tension between the characters. Meanwhile, the gray ominous sky and the flat, severe landscape of Kansas, the horizon a hundred miles out, lends its own atmosphere to the proceedings.Did Capote eventually fall in love with Perry? Perhaps, but you leave the film with a definite sense that Capote's feelings towards the condemned man were enigmatic at best, he was a man torn between finding the story and his very real concern for the fate of another human being. Capote is presented here, flaws and all, as someone rather despicable, but he was also quite sensitive. The anguish he suffers at the results of his decisions emerges as our only glimpse of his potential redemption.Capote is a stunning film, and a superb drama, as it mines one of man's darkest moral dilemmas - that of gaining and using another's trust for mostly selfish motivations. Much of the complication comes not only from the acknowledgement of guilt by the perpetrator, but also by the genuine feelings of concern and empathy that Capote develops for Perry, and he discovers that can't easily reconcile these feelings with his cold and calculated objective.The supporting players are exceptional, particularly Keener as Harper Lee and also Bruce Greenwood as author, Jack Dunphy, who was also Capote's partner and lover. But, without diminishing the contributions of all Capote's participants, this is really Hoffman's film. He's an absolute delight. Truman Capote was a complicated, competitive and totally driven man, a literary genius who had many demons, and Hoffman conveys all sides of him to perfection, letting you see the man behind the glasses, the effeminate voice, and the pouting often arrogant humor.

To understand Capote you must understand the man, and as you watch this movie you really understand the many layers of Truman Capote.  An egotist, that struggles with constant hints at homosexuality, as well as an insane genius.The basic plot of of the movie is that after great success from his novel ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" he is onto his next great venture.  In 1959 a family was brutally murdered by close range shotgun in a very bloody massacre.  Truman Capote interviews and empathizes one of the murders to see the man under the crime.  In doing so, he creates one of the greatest non-fiction novels to date, ""In Cold Blood.""  This movie uses great characterization and you really begin to understand what motivates each character in the story.This movie also used a lot of research, even little things like clearing up the rumor that Harper Lee wasn't the true author of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" which wasn't even proven false until after the movie was on DVD, and many of his letters and conversations.  I found this movie very enjoyable, and Hoffman's best acted film to date.  It's much different than a lot of other roles he's done.For those who saw many of the other Oscar nominated movies like Munich, Crash, and Brokeback Mountain, I feel it is time for you to also give this movie a shot.

966754,A1L9T258BHJZFE,B000E33VWW,Alexander,"[0, 0]","I'll be brief since this motion picture has already rec'd nearly 300 reviews - CAPOTE is an exceptional, somewhat complex, mature film that engages and satiates the viewer on so many levels.The acting here is simply superb. I'm going to lay claim that Hoffman's effort as the lead character is one of the very finest (Top 10 worthy) performances that I have ever witnessed. The awards he garnished are so well-deserved. And Catherine Keener's subtle yet strong portrayal as Harper Lee is flawless, as is the rest of the cast.The film itself is beautifully shot, and the script is likewise excellent. Really, can one truly find any fault with this motion picture?

966757,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000E33VWW,Alistair McHarg,"[1, 2]","Truman Capote was such a wretched, damaged, and contemptible caricature of a man that lobbing salvos at him seems unsportsmanlike; indeed, despite his abrasive superciliousness he was so pathetic as to engender not disdain but pity.  Ironically, this well-crafted film finds us recoiling in horror as we witness Capote's descent into complete moral oblivion, while the cold blooded killers he exploits appear increasingly like hapless victims of a devious opportunist.  Capote is a very small movie that focuses a laser beam on one specific thing, the relationship between Capote and the killers.  In doing so, it is able to carefully, and leisurely, develop a very nuanced and subtle psychological drama, a drama almost as chilling as the slaughter of four innocents in a desolate Kansas farmhouse.There is a sense in which all writers are vampires, invading the inner lives of others for material.  Under the best of circumstances this process occurs in good faith, with respect for the subjects and their dignity.  What we see here is what it looks like under the worst of circumstances, when there is only bad faith, betrayal, callous narcissism, and an endless succession of lies. Capote makes his deal with the devil and gets his reward, heightened celebrity and a fabulously successful book.  In retrospect, however, his methods cast doubt on the book's credibility, and the price he paid was dear, typewriter silenced, suicide by alcohol.  Not as quick as hanging, but probably more tortured.Many wonderful performances in this picture.  Clifton Collins, Jr. is faultless as Perry Smith, the limited, almost childishly innocent killer Capote has set his sights on.  Catherine Keener's Harper Lee is equally on point, while Bob Balaban is perfectly cast as New Yorker Editor William Shawn.  Which brings us to Philip Seymour Hoffman's celebrated embodiment of Truman Capote, a subject presenting two different problems.  The first is that his recreation is so uncanny one feels one has spent two hours in the presence of Truman Capote, roughly the equivalent of a month in Leavenworth.  The second is the effortless way Hoffman slips into Capote's tiny shoes, almost as if the part had been designed for him.  Indeed, from The Talented Mr. Ripley to Magnolia to Along Came Polly, Hoffman is always exactly the same person; pasty, bloated, debauched, passing for straight, alcoholic, corrupt, and completely devoid of moral fiber.  This is a man who, if he noticed a burning bishop on the other side of the street, would not cross that street to pour his beer on the bishop's head.  So, while the performance may be justifiably admired, I am more inclined to tip my hat to the casting director.",4,Kaput,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,2700,"['Truman', 'Capote', 'was', 'such', 'wretched', 'damaged', 'contemptible', 'caricature', 'man', 'lobbing', 'salvos', 'unsportsmanlike', 'indeed', 'abrasive', 'superciliousness', 'was', 'so', 'pathetic', 'engender', 'not', 'disdain', 'pity', 'Ironically', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'recoiling', 'horror', 'witness', 'Capote', 'descent', 'complete', 'moral', 'oblivion', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killers', 'appear', 'increasingly', 'like', 'hapless', 'victims', 'devious', 'opportunist', 'Capote', 'very', 'small', 'movie', 'laser', 'beam', 'one', 'specific', 'thing', 'relationship', 'Capote', 'killers', 'doing', 'so', 'able', 'carefully', 'leisurely', 'develop', 'very', 'nuanced', 'subtle', 'psychological', 'drama', 'drama', 'almost', 'as', 'chilling', 'slaughter', 'four', 'innocents', 'desolate', 'Kansas', 'sense', 'writers', 'are', 'vampires', 'invading', 'inner', 'lives', 'others', 'material', 'best', 'circumstances', 'process', 'good', 'faith', 'respect', 'subjects', 'dignity', 'What', 'see', 'here', 'what', 'worst', 'circumstances', 'when', 'only', 'bad', 'faith', 'betrayal', 'callous', 'narcissism', 'endless', 'succession', 'lies', 'Capote', 'deal', 'devil', 'reward', 'heightened', 'celebrity', 'fabulously', 'successful', 'book', 'retrospect', 'however', 'methods', 'cast', 'doubt', 'book', 'credibility', 'price', 'paid', 'was', 'dear', 'typewriter', 'silenced', 'suicide', 'alcohol', 'Not', 'as', 'quick', 'hanging', 'probably', 'more', 'tortured.Many', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'picture', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'faultless', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'limited', 'almost', 'childishly', 'innocent', 'killer', 'Capote', 'set', 'sights', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'equally', 'point', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Editor', 'William', 'Shawn', 'Which', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'celebrated', 'embodiment', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'subject', 'presenting', 'two', 'different', 'problems', 'first', 'recreation', 'so', 'uncanny', 'one', 'one', 'spent', 'two', 'hours', 'presence', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'roughly', 'equivalent', 'month', 'Leavenworth', 'second', 'effortless', 'way', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'tiny', 'shoes', 'almost', 'part', 'had', 'been', 'designed', 'Indeed', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'Magnolia', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly', 'Hoffman', 'always', 'exactly', 'same', 'person', 'bloated', 'debauched', 'passing', 'straight', 'alcoholic', 'corrupt', 'completely', 'devoid', 'moral', 'fiber', 'man', 'who', 'noticed', 'burning', 'bishop', 'other', 'side', 'street', 'would', 'not', 'cross', 'street', 'pour', 'beer', 'bishop', 'head', 'So', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'justifiably', 'admired', 'am', 'more', 'inclined', 'tip', 'hat', 'casting', 'director']",N/A
966758,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B000E33VWW,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[4, 5]","Warning:  This review contains a lot of background and contexting!CAPOTE the movie with Phillip Seymour Hoffman is an excellent movie with excellent precedents.  Less than two years after Truman Capote's masterwork, IN COLD BLOOD was published in 1966, a highly-acclaimed film version was released starring Robert Forsythe as the investigator and Robert Blake as Perry Smith the half-Indian, half-Irish ""changeling"" whose gentle air and violent pathologies so attracted Capote the researcher, more so than Perry's accomplice Dick Hickock.  After IN COLD BLOOD the blockbuster ""nonfiction novel"" and IN COLD BLOOD the movie, in the eighties came biographer Gerald Clarke's excellent and accessible biography CAPOTE, and it is from the middle third of his book that CAPOTE the movie is largely taken.The three adult Capotes each carve out a distinct niche in American letters, and, thanks to the author's savvy with publicity, represent three different icons. As a young adult Capote's writings were symbolist and somewhat ethereal, epitomized by his first full-length novel, OTHER VOICES OTHER ROOMS. But even the young Capote, anticipating middle-aged Truman's dictum that ""a boy has to sell his books"" was a risk taker:  his ""come-hither"" jacket photograph reminded people more of soft-core gay pornography in the staid postwar era than of the corduroy-with-elbow-patch type of author portrait then the norm.The middle Capote, our subject here, was the one who existed between November 15, 1959, the day he read about a rural family slaughtered on the Kansas Plains, and ends only with the killers' execution in 1966 and the publication of IN COLD BLOOD.  The third, and saddest part of the Capote saga is the alcoholic, frequently semi-coherent and malicious sprite of the TV talk shows, antagonizing lifelong friends yet titillating audiences with the remaining flames of his wit and abilities as raconteur.  Our movie here does a sublime job of allowing how that character was created.  IN COLD BLOOD was Capote's triumph but ultimately his tragedy too.As with Clark's biography, the 2005 film CAPOTE shows how the Clutter family murder quickly became Truman's ""meat,"" yet how the painstaking, years-long writing of the book and the even more painstaking wait -- let's be honest -- for the killers to be executed before the book could be released to a grateful American public in 1966.  The film ends with the killers' execution by hanging.First, highest praise for Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has the ""tiny terror"" and his personality down pat, everything from his boozy, court-holding parties to his immense scrupulousness and fact-checking while researching in Kansas for IN COLD BLOOD with his old buddy (Nell) Harper Lee, she of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  (Could a Hollywood screenwriter do better than this?)  The Capote he reveals is the Capote at his height, but he shows us how the seeds of Truman's ruin lay in what IN COLD BLOOD took out of him and he could never recover.There was another Capote besides the merry prankster and wit.  Charming Truman could be all bird-dog and utter seriousness when researching his book.  He and Harper Lee moved to Garden City, Kansas, talked to dozens of locals, yet used no tape-recorders nor took notes in front of the interviewees on the theory they would inhibit them from faithful recollection and emotion.  Late each night a note-comparing session was held, while Truman with his self-proclaimed ""94 percent recall"" trued his quotes and facts with Lee's.**MILD SPOILER GRAF**  Despite some welcome comic relief, CAPOTE, for all its excellence, is no one's idea of a ""feel-good movie.""  IN COLD BLOOD the ""nonfiction novel"" could draw on considerable dramatic irony in detailing the world the four Clutter family members were forced to depart.  The late Indian-summer weather after their demise was beautiful, ending in (to use a Capote-ism) an ""arid glitter"" and leaving local ranchers hoping for an ""open-range winter.""  The movie on the other hand, lacking I would guess the length to develop such symbolic irony (or unfairly afraid the audience might get confused, or both), opens to leaden skies and stays that way.  While I support dramatic license for the sake of a good taut movie, I personally was disappointed that the Clutter house was portrayed as a prosaic clapboard farmhouse (with Manitoba subbing for Kansas), instead of the self-designed, two-story brick real Clutter house, with its family-owned natural gas well and ""intermittent displays of spongy, liver-colored carpet"" covering the hard wood of the living room. In IN COLD BLOOD the book, it is made clear the reason the successful, outgoing and unpretentious Clutter family made for the most horrific victims:  ""Anybody else, it wouldn't have mattered so much,"" said the wife of a Japanese farmer, but the Clutters were the local ideal, successful, hardworking, unpretentious and friendly, and very much a part of the placid, if slightly phony, peaceable late Eisenhower ideal.  Except for the character of Alvin Dewey, the crime's lead investigator, and a few New Yorkers, most of Capote's characters detailed in the book are given different names -- after all, most of the contemporaries of the teenage Clutter chldren on the eve of the Sixties are still robust and just entering Senior Citizenship.  Even Perry's surviving sister Fern gets a pseudonym.  At least once, CAPOTE the movie creates a composite character:  churchgoing Nancy Ewalt and friend-of-the family Sue Kidd are rolled into adolescent ""Laura Tunney.""But what the movie does, and does to perfection, is document Truman Capote's growing fascination with ""changeling"" Perry Smith.  ""I felt we were the same person,"" Hoffman's Capote confesses at the end of the movie, ""except Perry left the house through the back door and I left it through the front.""  Also in accord with Clarke's biography, the film makes it clear that Capote was extremely sympathetic to Dick and Perry -- but only up to the point.  After a time he basically needed them dead and slowly withdrew communication with the condemned men.See this film--it is effective and Hoffman's performance is nothing short of extraordinary.  I can forgive the early glosses over the naturalism of IN COLD BLOOD's careful delineation of the Clutter family's life and character; in this movie THEY are the background while Capote's relationship with the prisoners is to the fore.Then, please read IN COLD BLOOD. Despite the fact that in the button-down world of publishing no one knew whether to class the book as fiction or non, it is a tour de force and few people who read it come away unmoved.  Then I would strongly urge the interested to read Clarke's bio of Capote, CAPOTE, still in print.  IN COLD BLOOD the sixties movie is worth a visit, as is HOW BRIEF A TREAT, a selective volume of Capote's letters from the 1940s to the 1980s, edited by Gerald Clarke and emphasizing the IN COLD BLOOD 1960s.  OTHER VOICES, OTHER ROOMS is as powerfully symbolic as it was in 1948, as are Capote's many short stories and holiday reminiscences.  I do hope this concentration of interest forces more of Capote's out-of-print works back into print (the reader may recall that this happened to Patricia Highsmith's *oeuvre* two years ago).  Worth going to some trouble to find in particular is THE MUSES ARE HEARD, a sympathetic but slightly prickly memoir of Capote's 1956 journey to Moscow with the American cast of ""Porgy and Bess"" on a cultural exchange mission to the U.S.S.R.  Like his other work it is sublimely written and this time sublimely funny too.[...]",5,An excellent addition to an excellent and growing canon....,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,7605,"['Warning',

966759,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000E33VWW,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[0, 0]","As the title suggests, this movie concerns the author of the 1966 classic, In Cold Blood, not the horrific quadruple murder in Holcomb, Kansas on November 15, 1959 on which Truman Capote based his greatest work. Viewers who expect a retelling of the book will be disappointed.But this story has great merit on its own, for it perfectly depicts the delicate, difficult (and in this case compromised) balance between a great writer's desperate urge to tell the truth and the strategy he must employ to obtain it. The day after the murders, Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) opens the New York Times, reads an account of the murders on the inside pages, carefully and neatly clips the article and calls his New Yorker editor, William Shawn, to say he will change course to write about the crime.Famed for Other Voices, Other Rooms and Breakfast at Tiffany's, the novelist initially plans an article or series, but Capote's work swiftly expands into something much more grand--and dark. He shamelessly declares to his lover, friends and associates, including Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), that this story will let him create a new genre, the non-fiction novel. To some, Capote's pronouncement seems pure braggadocio. Yet remarkably, he fulfills his promise, in a breathtakingly gruesome and insightful account (read by this viewer long ago), again today a bestseller.Highlighted here is Capote's means of investigating what drove Perry Edward Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) to their deeds. For years, he doggedly reports, collecting every available document and interviewing everyone associated with the killers or their victims--rural businessman and farmer Herbert Clutter, his wife Bonnie, his 16-year-old daughter Nancy and his son Kenyon.But only through Capote's own lies and prevarications can he sufficiently engage the perpetrators that they will reveal their motive and the awful details of the Clutters' deaths: spurred by a false rumor that Clutter had $10,000 in his prairie home, Smith and Hickock embarked upon a fruitless search that yielded them only rage, some $40 or $50, buckets of blood--and their own eventual demise on Kansas gallows. (Parents, beware: Flashback scenes make this film highly unsuitable for children.)To gain interviews, access to legal documents and obtain unlimited visitation rights, Capote cozies up to families, friends and colleagues of law enforcement officials and even bribes the warden at Leavenworth, where the killers are soon transferred. He also ingratiates himself with friends and families of victims and killers alike. Armed with photos and details of the killers' broken and dysfunctional early lives, Capote begins conflicted friendships with the two men, both convicted of four counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death.Capote develops seemingly genuine sympathy for the imprisoned murderers. Upon his return to Kansas, Capote learns that Smith has not eaten for a month, races out to buy baby food and then spoon-feeds him. But his kindness is ultimately self-serving, for it also ensures that Smith won't die before telling Capote details of the murders.Fairly early in his investigation, Capote decides to entitle his as-yet-unwritten non-fiction thriller, In Cold Blood.Later, even after completing two thirds of the book, Capote lies to keep Smith talking. Smith reads a news report on Capote's recent New York reading, confronts him, and demands to know the book's title. Without hesitation, the straight-faced Capote says he has no idea. The reading's organizers concocted that title, he lies to Smith, in hopes of sensationalizing the event and drawing a big audience. Smith continues talking to his ""amigo.""Capote's empathy is not entirely duplicitous. While repulsed by the evil deeds of Smith and Hickock, he finds and funds an attorney to appeal their case.At some level, Capote relates to them: His own childhood was unhappy. Born in New Orleans, Capote was dragged from place to place by his promiscuous mother, who abandoned him before he was sent to relatives in Alabama. Capote can't precisely explain, he tells Harper Lee, his childhood Alabama friend, in his characteristically high, disconcerting voice. ""It is as if Perry and I grew up in the same house, and one day he went out the back door and I went out the front."" The case has radically changed his life, he says. Yet Capote leverages his sympathy and personal experiences to gain his subjects' confidence.Moreover, when the killers' appeal reaches the Supreme Court years later, Capote wants only to finish his story, which implicitly requires that their lives end. Thus Smith's request for Capote to find another attorney generates a brief reply, in which Capote claims to have exhausted all possibilities. In truth, this time, he has done nothing and no longer wants to.While Harper Lee's masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird becomes a bestseller and blockbuster movie, she also becomes Capote's alter-ego and his conscience. Only her intervention prompts Capote to rise from his drunken stupor in New York and fly to Kansas with New Yorker editor William Shawn to visit Smith and Hickock one last time. There, Capote confronts his own internal conflict, and at Smith's request, tearfully agrees to witness their executions.There's no secret to the ending of this tale: In Cold Blood made Capote one of America's greatest writers. In the book, he wrote, ""Four shotgun blasts that, all told, ended six human lives."" But that's false too. In reality, the crime killed seven, including the author who shone world attention on the murders. This movie tells us why, however great, Capote never finished another book, and probably why he drank himself to death.--Alyssa A.

966760,A21AX7U9UNIV75,B000E33VWW,"Amazon Customer ""SWNovice""","[0, 0]","First of all, I am a fan of Philip Seymore Hoffman.  I have long hoped to see more of him and in more challenging roles.  This is some of the best acting on film.  The story is told so brilliantly that it is worthy of its' subject, the immortal author of ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" and ""In Cold Blood,"" which is the period of his life the film focuses on.  Like a great novel, this film breathes - it does not do our thinking for us and it does not need to tell us how to feel at any point.  Like a well written novel, it assumes the reader (or, viewer) can think.  It is full of subtlety.Hoffman is Capote.  Capote was one of those rare, charismatic individuals that could captivate a room full of people just by entering.  He could hold them captive with his tales and antics for hours.  He knew how to reach people.  He treated everyone as an individual and learned each person's personal language.  For some, that language may be shared experience, an expression of empathy or sympathy and for others it might be so simple and crude as money.  He was a strange, amazing little man and Hoffman succeeded at raising him from the grave.I hope to see more Hoffman after this, and in roles that are worthy of his sublime genius.

966762,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000E33VWW,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Okay, so there is no denying the fact that Philip Seymour Hoffman nailed his performance as Truman Capote; he has the Oscar to prove it; but what I adore so much about `Capote' is that it never rests heavy on the shoulders of one man.  It never once allows the magnitude of Hoffman's performance remain the only redeeming factor of the film.  The script, the direction, the supporting actors, the score, the cinematography; everything is top notch and just as memorable as the lead performance.  In fact, the best thing about this movie is the masterful direction from Bennett Miller (who should have won the Oscar in my opinion).`Capote' catalogs the journey author Truman Capote took in order to pen his last completed `novel'; `In Cold Blood'.  `In Cold Blood' was the first `non-fiction novel'; based on the harrowing Clutter family murders; and proved to make Capote a household name.  Despite this great achievement, the experience took its toll on Truman and reduced him to a mere shell of his former self.Miller shoots the film in a very distilled and serene manner; creating a true sense of lucid menacing.  The film is shot in muted tones, the coloring dull; the voices almost hushed and this adds so many layers to the mood of the film.  Mychael Danna's score is yet another masterful facet of the film; its fragile, almost brittle piano strings playing perfect compliment to the grace of the film.  Adam Kimmel beautifully constructs the films cinematography, creating an eerie vibe that permeates each and every scene.  The gritty construction of the garments worn; the broken down and haunting way the sets were designed; everything about this film complemented one another brilliantly.`Capote' is the type of film I refer to as a `mood' film, for it relays a certain emotion so well you can't help but succumb to its advances.As the film follows Truman Capote; making his way to Kansas, investigating the horrible crime, interviewing the locals, familiarizing himself with the accused; we sense his obsession and his overall selfish desires that deride any and all good that could have come from this adventure.  `Capote' does a standup job of fleshing out the man that is Truman Capote, making him very real to us and exposing him for who he truly was; a man self concerned and manipulative.  His relationships are bare and open for the viewer, which helps shed a light on his somewhat ambiguous actions.  His motives may not always appear clear, for he was a very subtle yet conniving man; but with a keen eye one begins to understand and comprehend just what this man was all about.So now we've come to the acting.  Yes, Philip Seymour Hoffman was astonishing; utterly phenomenal.  His performance gets better and better for me each and every time I watch the film.  The way he says so much with the blank stare; the expressionless face that pierces through the audience and sings like a bird.  There is a scene, probably my favorite scene in the film, where Capote visits the morgue.  His face, that stagnant expression as he lifts the mother's coffin lid and pears in at the body, is priceless.  While I still feel that Heath Ledgers monumental achievement in `Brokeback Mountain' was superior work, I can't really complain about Hoffman's Oscar win; he truly was amazing here.But Hoffman is not the only one.Catherine Keener received a lot of attention for her subtle supporting role as Nelle Harper Lee.  She really develops her character nicely; but like everyone else on the screen, she falls into the background whenever Hoffman is on the screen.  Chris Cooper turns in a very fine performance as well as Bruce Greenwood; but it is Clifton Collins Jr., the accused, who is able to hold his own against Hoffman.  As Perry Smith, the murderer for whom Capote strikes an oddly perverse relationship, Clifton is able to really get under this mans skin, into his mind and formulate his every action.  It's a superb performance that sadly went underappreciated.In closing I just want to say that `Capote' is a superbly crafted gem of a film; a biopic that fleshes out its characters and delivers a masterful impression on the audience.  Miller is a marvelous director who captures the heart and soul of his subject; taking many risks in his portrayal and never condescending to sugarcoat or mask over the important details.  When we read Capote's words at the end of the film; ""More tears are shed for answered prayers than unanswered ones""; we are shell-shocked with savage grief because we know those words to be true.  The entire film is haunting, chilling even, and the aftereffect is one that will stay with you long after the film has ended.",5,An answered prayer indeed; one truly remarkable film...,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,4666,"['Okay', 'denying', 'fact', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'nailed', 'performance', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Oscar', 'prove', 'what', 'adore', 'so', 'much', 'Capote', 'never', 'heavy', 'shoulders', 'one', 'man', 'never', 'once', 'magnitude', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'remain', 'only', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'film', 'script', 'direction', 'supporting', 'actors', 'score', 'cinematography', 'everything', 'top', 'notch', 'just', 'as', 'memorable', 'lead', 'performance', 'fact', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'masterful', 'direction', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'opinion', 'Capote', 'journey', 'author', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'took', 'order', 'pen', 'last', 'completed', 'novel', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'was', 'first', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'based', 'harrowing', 'Clutter', 'family', 'murders', 'proved', 'make', 'Capote', 'household', 'name', 'great', 'achievement', 'experience', 'took', 'toll', 'Truman', 'reduced', 'mere', 'shell', 'former', 'self.Miller', 'shoots', 'film', 'very', 'distilled', 'serene', 'manner', 'creating', 'true', 'sense', 'lucid', 'menacing', 'film', 'shot', 'muted', 'tones', 'coloring', 'dull', 'voices', 'almost', 'hushed', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'mood', 'film', 'Mychael', 'Danna', 'score', 'yet', 'masterful', 'facet', 'film', 'fragile', 'almost', 'brittle', 'piano', 'strings', 'playing', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'grace', 'film', 'Adam', 'Kimmel', 'beautifully', 'films', 'cinematography', 'creating', 'eerie', 'vibe', 'scene', 'gritty', 'construction', 'garments', 'broken', 'down', 'haunting', 'way', 'sets', 'were', 'designed', 'everything', 'film', 'complemented', 'one', 'brilliantly.', 'Capote', 'type', 'film', 'refer', 'mood', 'film', 'certain', 'emotion', 'so', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'succumb', 'film', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'making', 'way', 'Kansas', 'investigating', 'horrible', 'crime', 'interviewing', 'locals', 'familiarizing', 'accused', 'sense', 'obsession', 'overall', 'selfish', 'desires', 'deride', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'adventure', 'Capote', 'standup', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'man', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'making', 'very', 'real', 'exposing', 'who', 'truly', 'was', 'man', 'self', 'concerned', 'manipulative', 'relationships', 'are', 'bare', 'open', 'viewer', 'shed', 'light', 'somewhat', 'ambiguous', 'actions', 'motives', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'appear', 'clear', 'was', 'very', 'subtle', 'yet', 'conniving', 'man', 'keen', 'eye', 'one', 'understand', 'comprehend', 'just', 'what', 'man', 'was', 'about.So', 'now', ""'ve"", 'come', 'acting', 'Yes', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'astonishing', 'utterly', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'better', 'better', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'way', 'so', 'much', 'blank', 'stare', 'expressionless', 'face', 'audience', 'sings', 'bird', 'scene', 'probably', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Capote', 'morgue', 'face', 'stagnant', 'expression', 'mother', 'coffin', 'lid', 'pears', 'body', 'priceless', 'still', 'feel', 'Heath', 'Ledgers', 'monumental', 'achievement', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'superior', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain', 'Hoffman', 'Oscar', 'win', 'truly', 'was', 'amazing', 'here.But', 'Hoffman', 'not', 'only', 'one.Catherine', 'Keener', 'received', 'lot', 'attention', 'subtle', 'supporting', 'role', 'Nelle', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'really', 'character', 'nicely', 'everyone', 'else', 'screen', 'background', 'whenever', 'Hoffman', 'screen', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'very', 'fine', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'accused', 'who', 'able', 'hold', 'own', 'Hoffman', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'murderer', 'whom', 'Capote', 'oddly', 'perverse', 'relationship', 'Clifton', 'able', 'really', 'get', 'skin', 'mind', 'formulate', 'action', 'superb', 'performance', 'sadly', 'went', 'closing', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'Capote', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'gem', 'film', 'biopic', 'out', 'characters', 'delivers', 'masterful', 'impression', 'audience', 'Miller', 'marvelous', 'director', 'who', 'heart', 'soul', 'subject', 'taking', 'many', 'risks', 'portrayal', 'never', 'condescending', 'sugarcoat', 'mask', 'important', 'details', 'When', 'read', 'Capote', 'words', 'end', 'film', 'More', 'tears', 'are', 'shed', 'answered', 'prayers', 'unanswered', 'ones', 'are', 'shell-shocked', 'savage', 'grief', 'know', 'words', 'be', 'true', 'entire', 'film', 'haunting', 'chilling', 'even', 'aftereffect', 'one', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'film', 'ended']",N/A

Collins, Jr.'s spotlight review - that's about the best summary of a movie I've read on amazon.com.  I especially like the articulation of the element of the film I had been trying to wrap words around: that director Bennett Miller expertly juxtaposes the descent of Capote with the ascent of best friend, the unassuming Harper Lee.What's truly fascinating when watching 'Capote' is realizing that after 'In Cold Blood,' Capote *never* finished another piece of work.  He suffered through 22 years of complete artistic constipation.  By the time most people of my age got to know him, Capote was a freak show - a drunken, pill-popping sham who subsisted only through talk show appearances.Director Miller, screenwriter Dan Futterman and biographer Gerald Clarke make clear that 'In Cold Blood' scarred Capote.  He literally sold his soul to mold and finish the book he wanted.  He never recovered.  Miller depicts the essence of the roots of Capote's long, slow fall into irrelevance.And for all the talk about Hoffman's performance (he deserved that Oscar), the real breakout story here is Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith.

966764,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000E33VWW,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Average-height Phil Hoffman quickly has us believing he's the diminutive author ofIN COLD BLOODin CAPOTE, the story of Truman Capote's agonies to complete the very first true crime novel, one that was originally intended as only aNEW YORKERmagazine article.Clifton Collins is most convincing as condemned killer Perry Smith, who enters into a relationship with Capote under the strangest of circumstances: within the confines of a jail cell. Smith emotionally manipulates the trusting author into aiding an ultimately futile battle to overturn his death sentence. Only when time is running out for him does Perry reveal to his friend the psychopath that he really is. The effect upon Truman of Smith's graphic confession is as if he were also ascending the gallows stairs. (We learn in postscript that Capote never completed another book after IN COLD BLOOD and that his death was related to long-term alcohol damage.)Kudos also to Catherine Keener's Harper Lee.

There are two keys to why this movie doesn't work:1. There is no conflict/climax. The thin story revolves around Truman's research and subsequent struggle with writing his book, but a short time into the movie the viewer soon says ""who cares?"" because there's nothing at stake. You're not rooting for or against anyone.2. We've seen this type of movie before (several times). You know the type - murderers are captured, and there's a person with influence who befriends/falls in love/sympathizes with the killers, and mourns them when they are executed. The difference between those movies and Capote is that they are vastly better, not to mention that the concept of convicted killers being shown as victims is troubling as it is, and is an irresponsible message.In all, this is a boring re-tread of a movie, especially if you are unfamiliar with Truman Capote (which most of us are).

The action solely revolves around Truman being sent to Kansas to investigate the Clutter family murders for The New Yorker. He brings with him his lifelong friend, Harper Lee, who served as his research assistant. Once the movie begins, it is a challenge to pause. Phillip Seymour Hoffman put forth tremendous effort to recreate on screen (and I think accurately) one of the most distinctive personalities of our time. His charm was well-known and infectious and, most probably, completely fabricated. As a man, Capote may have had much in common with the killers of ""In Cold Blood."" He was a pathological liar and didn't seem to have much of an interest in the suffering, or existence, of others. You get a glimpse of his lack of empathy when he goes to Harper Lee's party for To Kill a Mockingbird and doesn't notice her or extend his congratulations for her achievement. Another reflection of his soul comes at the outset when he tells the Kansas police sheriff that he doesn't care about who the killers are or if they'll ever be caught.

It shows the length a writer will go to, using conniving promises and deceit for his own benefit.  This was one of the first books I read to the very end in the late Sixties.  It was in such detail that it was hard to visualize how strangers could do such a thing to an ordinary family.  It took place in November, 1959, in Kansas and made the news even in New York City.This thoroughly corrupt magazine writer took the train all the way to Kansas to research for an article.  He had no restraints in his intrusion on the privacy of the dead, opening the hardwood caskets and describing how the victims appeared and the clothes they wore in death for a closed casket funeral.  He spent three months there attending the trial, then returned to New York to talk, talk, talk about every little detail.  He said he was talking his head off.  He talked incessantly about the case and his attachment to Perry Smith, the triggerman with no conscience.They had much in common.  Perry, whose mother was a Cherokee Indian, grew up in an orphanage.  Truman was deserted by his mother as a child and left with some aunts in Alabama.  He used his wiles to convince Perry that he will make him less than a monster in the book he plans to write.  Perry thinks Capote is a friend, but he continually lied to him about the book using cruelty to get his way.  ""People remember first impressions"" and ""be careful what you do to get what you want.""Capote's lover, Jack Dunphy, gave him an ultimatum to come to Spain where he will be writing his own book; he abandoned the murderers in prison out in Leavenworth for ""love,"" even though he admitted that he felt a kinship with Perry.After three years with the book two-thirds finished, he had a public reading in a New York theater and received a standing ovation for his snooping in Kansas and his imaginative ""non-fiction"" novel.  He finally got his confession from Perry who told the details to clear his conscience, but it was just fodder for the book.  IN COLD BLOOD was built on tainted blood, of the deranged killers who were after money (found only $40-50 in the house), and Perry was the one who did the shootings.  By the execution date in April, 1965, Capote was a basket case but the inmates were cool and collected.  He cried crocodile tears as he was not a friend.  Another writer, Harper Lee, told him ""the fact is you didn't want to save them.""  The book was published in 1966.The dial telephones were a good touch as that is what we had back then.  In the apartment he shared in New York with Jack, the bed was an antique like Margaret Butler's.

astonishingly precocious age, a title he pirated from a wealthy confidante who told him about a sexual encounter he'd had with a sailor, and the next morning Capote's friend said to his guest, ""Brunch is on me at the finest restaurant you can name"", and the seaman said, ""Well, let's have breakfast at Tiffany's!""..Capote, like all resourceful writers salted that away, for that useful rainy day..It was a title in search of a novel..And that's how Capote worked, he imagined a scenario and spent months constructing it in his sub-conscious mind, then went into seclusion and wrote like the devil..Capote stumbled upon the senseless killing of an an upright, God fearing family in Kansas while perusing the backpages of the New York Times, and realized there was sensational value in the story, and intended to write how the murders affected the community, regardless if the perpetrators were ever captured..Capote told his editor he was leaving for Kansas immediately, and would take Harper Lee, author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", along as his research assistant..Nell, Harper Lee, would prove invaluable to Capote since she had an engaging ability to charm a rural community already on extreme edge since the incident, and was less shocking than Truman upon introduction..Capote met Alvin Dewey, the Bureau agent in charge of capturing the killers and told him he needed carte blanche to the police files, but was not concerned if the killers were found, he only wanted to write how the town was holding up!..Dewey told Capote, ""Well, I do care, Herb Clutter was my friend""..In the end, Capote used his contagious charm to defrost the community, and was granted first person status, above all other journalists covering the crime, in fact Capote wrote a friend, ""People here initially rejected me, but now I'm practically the Mayor.""..When Capote and Nell first spyed Perry Smith and Dick Hickok in court at their arraignment, Capote told Nell, ""Look, Perry Smith's feet barely touch the ground.""..Nell told a friend, ""Oh my God, this is the beginning of an intense love affair between Truman and Perry""..While writing ""In Cold Blood"", Truman changed course and realized the article intended for The New Yorker would become a narrative novel, since the subject matter expanded, and his editors agreed..Six years hence in utter agony ""In Cold Blood"" was published, and Capote was the recipient of adulation not seen since Hemingway wrote ""The Old Man and the Sea""..The net result became, Capote had the wealth and celebrity to finance his disintegration, and never finished another novel..Capote died alone at the home of Joanne Carson, wife of late night talk show host Johnny Carson at the age of 59, suffering from acute alcoholism and drug addiction, perhaps because he never recovered from the trauma inflicted on himself from ""expoiting"" Perry Smith, who died compliments of the state of Kansas, from a hangman's noose, for the shotgun murders of the Herb Clutter family, for a score of 29 dollars, and a transistor radio.",5,"Can you really eat  ""Breakfast at Tiffany's?""",1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,3148,"['Truman',

966780,A48THA5X4OUAB,B000E33VWW,Billyjack D'Urberville,"[2, 2]","This film is a generally excellent piece of realism about writer Truman Capote and the making of his early 1960s ""non-fiction novel"" about the murder of a Kansas farm family, In Cold Blood.  The performances, cinematography, design, pacing, and (for the most part) direction and editing cannot be faulted.  My problem is the moral premise as embodied in the script.The script sets up Capote's childhood friend, author Harper Lee of To Kill a Mockingbird fame, as his co-worker and moral conscience, esentially convicting him of exploiting the killers on death row, ""wanting them dead"" finally so that Capote could publish the book.  I have no idea if this indictment of Capote derived from Harper Lee, who is an admirable figure and admirably portayed.  But even if true, the conclusion borders on the glib, and is questionable.  The essential fault of the movie is that it builds this indictment of Capote as a writer, but does not give him equally resonant words to justify his methods or ends.  It simply assumes that fame, writing a best seller, etc, is a bad and inferior motive.  And it assumes that was Capote's motive.Capote was a weird, quirky enough figure and is rather easily parodied.  He was a marginal, desperately lonely figure, mawkish, embarrassing, somewhat perverse.  But what he was doing was a literary experiment.  It took somebody like him to enter this no man's land.  The book was successful in its own right and on its own merits.  It has indeed had an influence on American art and literature, some very good and some bad.  But the experimental nature of the project was bound to incur unknown personal and psychological costs and risks.  Art is necessary for any mature society to see itself, and while that premise does not justify any art or any experiment, it is enough to justify a serious endeavor like In Cold Blood.Secondly, the charge of Capote exploiting the killers is highly questionable.  They were clearly guilty, had due process of law, and the idea either that (1) Capote could have done more for them, i.e., getting better lawyers for more appeals, or (2) such appeals would have been justified or successful, is really highly questionable.  One cannot impose present day legal ideals, or attitudes about capital punishment, ex post facto on the early 1960s.  There were trials in that day truly way out of line (the Sam Shepard carnival in Ohio upon which The Fugitive was based) which make better and fairer comparison than present day assumptions.  There is no evidence the Kansas killers were treated in anything but a sober and deliberate manner for those times, by the system.  Their execution was an inevitability.  And the so-called ""lies"" Capote told Perry Smith were not only either harmless (he personally hadn't settled on a book title), or weirdly humane (i.e., his sister still cared for him).  Are these the sort of sins with which we convict major art in this country these days?  If so, it says more about us -- a descent toward the trivially personal over 45 years, with a tendancy to send people up the flagpole for derision.  Both tendancies were notably absent from Capote's final product, by the way, as to all concerned -- whatever misdemeanors (or mere infractions) he may have committed along the way.But you do not have to like Truman Capote personally, or even like his book, to believe that his cause deserved more of a voice in this project.  The fact is, the plain people of Kansas gave the In Cold Blood killers a fairer trial than this film does Truman Capote.  Thus for all its great aesthetic merits, which carry it far, this film is ultimately not satisfying as either an unbiased record or as a moral tale.",4,Everything But the Moral Premise,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,3687,"['film', 'generally', 'excellent', 'piece', 'realism', 'writer', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'making', 'early', '1960s', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'murder', 'Kansas', 'farm', 'family', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'design', 'pacing', 'most', 'part', 'direction', 'editing', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'problem', 'moral', 'premise', 'embodied', 'script.The', 'script', 'up', 'Capote', 'childhood', 'friend', 'author', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'fame', 'co-worker', 'moral', 'conscience', 'esentially', 'convicting', 'exploiting', 'killers', 'death', 'row', 'wanting', 'dead', 'finally', 'Capote', 'could', 'publish', 'book', 'have', 'idea', 'indictment', 'Capote', 'derived', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'who', 'admirable', 'figure', 'admirably', 'portayed', 'even', 'true', 'conclusion', 'borders', 'glib', 'questionable', 'essential', 'fault', 'movie', 'indictment', 'Capote', 'writer', 'not', 'give', 'equally', 'resonant', 'words', 'justify', 'methods', 'ends', 'simply', 'fame', 'writing', 'best', 'seller', 'etc', 'bad', 'inferior', 'motive', 'was', 'Capote', 'motive.Capote', 'was', 'weird', 'quirky', 'enough', 'figure', 'rather', 'easily', 'parodied', 'was', 'marginal', 'desperately', 'lonely', 'figure', 'mawkish', 'embarrassing', 'somewhat', 'perverse', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'literary', 'experiment', 'took', 'somebody', 'enter', 'man', 'land', 'book', 'was', 'successful', 'own', 'right', 'own', 'merits', 'indeed', 'had', 'influence', 'American', 'art', 'literature', 'very', 'good', 'bad', 'experimental', 'nature', 'project', 'was', 'bound', 'incur', 'unknown', 'personal', 'psychological', 'costs', 'risks', 'Art', 'necessary', 'mature', 'society', 'see', 'premise', 'not', 'justify', 'art', 'experiment', 'enough', 'justify', 'serious', 'endeavor', 'Cold', 'Blood.Secondly', 'charge', 'Capote', 'exploiting', 'killers', 'highly', 'questionable', 'were', 'clearly', 'guilty', 'had', 'due', 'process', 'law', 'idea', '1', 'Capote', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'i.e.', 'getting', 'better', 'lawyers', 'more', 'appeals', '2', 'such', 'appeals', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'justified', 'successful', 'really', 'highly', 'questionable', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'impose', 'present', 'day', 'legal', 'ideals', 'attitudes', 'capital', 'punishment', 'ex', 'post', 'facto', 'early', '1960s', 'were', 'trials', 'day', 'truly', 'way', 'line', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'carnival', 'Ohio', 'Fugitive', 'was', 'based', 'make', 'better', 'fairer', 'comparison', 'present', 'day', 'assumptions', 'evidence', 'Kansas', 'killers', 'were', 'treated', 'anything', 'sober', 'deliberate', 'manner', 'times', 'system', 'execution', 'was', 'inevitability', 'so-called', 'lies', 'Capote', 'told', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'either', 'harmless', 'personally', 'had', ""n't"", 'settled', 'book', 'title', 'weirdly', 'humane', 'i.e.', 'sister', 'still', 'cared', 'Are', 'sort', 'sins', 'convict', 'major', 'art', 'country', 'days', 'so', 'more', 'descent', 'trivially', 'personal', '45', 'years', 'tendancy', 'send', 'people', 'flagpole', 'derision', 'tendancies', 'were', 'notably', 'absent', 'Capote', 'final', 'product', 'way', 'concerned', 'misdemeanors', 'mere', 'infractions', 'may', 'have', 'committed', 'way.But', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'like', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'personally', 'even', 'book', 'believe', 'cause', 'deserved', 'more', 'voice', 'project', 'fact', 'plain', 'people', 'Kansas', 'gave', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'killers', 'fairer', 'trial', 'film', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Thus', 'great', 'aesthetic', 'merits', 'carry', 'far', 'film', 'ultimately', 'not', 'satisfying', 'unbiased', 'record', 'moral', 'tale']",N/A

966783,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000E33VWW,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 8]","`capote', the biopic of a few years in the life of novelist and short story writer, Truman Capote, directed by Bennett Miller, and starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman, for which he won the Best Actor Academy Award, is very much of an `insider's movie with strong influences from it's primary subject, Capote's `nonfiction novel', `In Cold Blood'.For starters, the director and writer, Dan Futterman, take a very minimalist approach to their subject. For a film about a writer, there seem to be remarkably few words spoken in the script. This may have been a big mistake for the sake of many viewers. Even though my mother lived through Capote's height of celebrity with many appearances on the talk show circuit, she was totally unfamiliar with what he had written, even though she was quite familiar with both the magazine `The New Yorker' and the novel and movie, `Breakfast at Tiffany's' for which Capote was most famous before `In Cold Blood'. Even if you knew of Capote, or at least knew more of his reputation than the Kansas locals he met at the outset of his research into the book, you may have had trouble identifying the other major literary characters appearing briefly on the screen, such as Harper Lee, the author of `To Kill a Mockingbird' and Capote's assistant on his trips to Kansas, Bill Shawn (played by Bob Balaban), the Editor in Chief of `The New Yorker', and Richard Avedon, the extremely talented and influential fashion photographer who, until his recent death, did almost all the photographs for `The New Yorker'. The role of Capote's companion who we meet only through telephone conversations between he and Capote, is even more subtle, as this individual could easily be either Capote's agent or simply a colleague.This movie seems to me to be extremely similar in style to the recent Coppola / Bill Murray film, `Lost in Translation', which also has sparse dialogue and very little character development. That is not to say there is no significant character development in `capote', especially on the part of Capote himself. The perps of the Clutter murders had a profound effect on Capote, expecially Perry Smith, the more articulate of the two. And yet, in spite of the fact that Capote's interest in the case was to some extent responsible for various stays of execution and improved legal representation, Capote always put completing his book ahead of their fates. As Hoffman and Miller state in some of the commentary, Capote wanted them to be executed not so much because they were guilty as because it would enable to wrap up the story of his book.The DVD package includes my favorite special feature, that is, voiceover commentaries by the director and star and the director and cinematographer. In my experience, this is the only extra which is often worth troubling with, expecially in a movie with such a narrow focus. All the `making of' featurettes often simply repeat what you get first hand in the comments, unless it happens to be a special effects action fest where you need the specialist's point of view on how, for example, Andy Serkis did Gollum or King Kong.The very best thing about this movie is Hoffman's portrayal of Capote, which is probably only really interesting if you happen to have seen him on TV or know a lot about his work. I have the feeling that aside from major cinema fans, this movie may be lost on the average movie audience used to the richness in George Lucas / Stephen Spielberg / Peter Jackson ourves.The fact is, I enjoyed this movie a lot, but that is probably because I am well versed in the history of both the author, `The New Yorker', Capote's connection to the magazine, and his connection to this crime.",5,Great cinematic and dramatic artistry.

We know that he didn't finish another novel after it, too, which begs the question, ""Why?""Fast-forward to the 2005 film CAPOTE and we get the answer.Mr. Capote is reincarnated in the body of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, and it is ""through"" him that we get to find out what happened during this snapshot time of Truman Capote's life. A vicious murder of a family in rural Kansas takes place and Truman races there to find out if there's a magazine story in it. But what he finds is much more than just a short periodical piece. As the murderers are captured, Truman becomes enraptured with the idea of learning why these seemingly innocuous men did something so heinous.Truman digs deep, perhaps too deep, and we watch as every shred of decency is stripped away from him just so he can ""finish the story."" He bribes the prison warden and lies to the two killers (and ultimately to himself) about why he's really spending so much time with them on death row.In the end, it rips Truman apart, causing him to become an alcoholic and a shell of what he once was.______________________________________________________________________________Occasionally casting directors get ""it"" right. And this time, they not only got it right by casting Mr. Hoffman in the role of Truman Capote, they bottled a bit of magic and captured it on film. David Strathairn did it, too, in his performance as Edward R. Murrow in GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, but Hoffman takes it to a euphoric level for movie watchers. His mannerisms, voice and costumes were impeccable. Many times I thought I was actually watching Truman Capote and not an actor playing him. Now that's great acting.If there was any failings in the movie, I'd have to say it was with its overall script. Although intriguing and genuinely creepy, it held only a small piece of what Truman Capote was. I realize that to capture all of what he was would be almost impossible ...but there you go. That's life.Even so, Hoffman deserves all the accolades he's gotten and I have no doubt he'll jump up on stage at the Oscars this year and pick up his statue.",4,Hoffman Channeled Capote,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,2191,"['Truman', 'Capote', 'masterpiece', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', '1965', 'set', 'new', 'standard', 'style', 'literary', 'world', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'novel', 'too', 'question', 'Why', 'Fast-forward', '2005', 'film', 'CAPOTE', 'get', 'answer.Mr', 'Capote', 'reincarnated', 'body', 'actor', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'snapshot', 'time', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'life', 'vicious', 'murder', 'family', 'rural', 'Kansas', 'place', 'Truman', 'there', 'find', 'out', 'magazine', 'story', 'what', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'short', 'periodical', 'piece', 'murderers', 'are', 'captured', 'Truman', 'enraptured', 'idea', 'learning', 'why', 'seemingly', 'innocuous', 'men', 'did', 'something', 'so', 'heinous.Truman', 'digs', 'deep', 'perhaps', 'too', 'deep', 'watch', 'shred', 'decency', 'stripped', 'away', 'just', 'can', 'finish', 'story', 'prison', 'warden', 'two', 'killers', 'ultimately', 'why', 'really', 'spending', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'death', 'row.In', 'end', 'Truman', 'apart', 'causing', 'become', 'alcoholic', 'shell', 'what', 'once', 'was.______________________________________________________________________________Occasionally', 'casting', 'directors', 'get', 'right', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'got', 'right', 'casting', 'Mr.', 'Hoffman', 'role', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'bottled', 'bit', 'magic', 'captured', 'film', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'did', 'too', 'performance', 'Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'Hoffman', 'euphoric', 'level', 'movie', 'watchers', 'mannerisms', 'voice', 'costumes', 'were', 'impeccable', 'Many', 'times', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'watching', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'not', 'actor', 'playing', 'Now', 'great', 'acting.If', 'was', 'failings', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'was', 'overall', 'script', 'intriguing', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'held', 'only', 'small', 'piece', 'what', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'was', 'realize', 'capture', 'what', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'impossible', 'go', 'life.Even', 'so', 'Hoffman', 'accolades', 'gotten', 'have', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'jump', 'up', 'stage', 'Oscars', 'year', 'pick', 'up', 'statue']",N/A

The screenplay is as gripping and exciting as a fictional mystery, yet it builds on the true account of how Truman Capote came to writeIn Cold Blood-- a new genre he dubbed the ""non-fiction novel"".After reading the New York Times article on the murder of a farming family in Holcomb, Kansas in 1959, Capote travels there with childhood friend Harper Lee, author of To kill a Mocking bird, on the premise of writing an article for the magazine ""The New Yorker"". In the process he befriends Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) who heads the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and a number of townspeople. The killers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins) and Richard Hickock, are caught and convicted.Capote visits them in prison and helps obtain a lawyer for their appeal, but eventually becomes obsessed with Smith. He sees him as a vulnerable, sensitive and misunderstood man; someone who he can relate to -- alone, troubled and sad. By the time their appeals are rejected and they are headed for the gallows, Capote is overwhelmed with grief, perhaps personal guilt for using them to write his ""non-fiction novel"". It is a tragedy one supposes Capote never overcame, considering no major work from him appeared after ""In Cold Blood"". Ironically, he, too, in a way became a victim.To visually convey the brutality of the subject matter, a number of images are startlingly realistic, and stay with you long after the movie ends. Among these is Truman Capote opening the wooden casket of the murdered Mrs. Clutter, dressed in blue, her faced wrapped entirely in cotton. So too is the bloody and violent slashing of Mr. Clutter's throat and the shotgun blasts to the heads of the Clutter family. The hanging of Perry Smith, which begins with heavy breathing quickens as he is about to be executed, is an experience the viewer practically lives. And finally, after he is dropped from the trap door, his body jerks momentarily, then  it is still forever -- a scene chillingly reminiscent of the movieIn Cold Blood.Moreover, it is Philip Seymour Hoffman who immerses himself in the persona of Truman Capote. He assumes Capote's appearance and quirky demeanour, complete with raspy voice and mannerisms, with such convincing perfection. It is little wonder he has garnered a host of accolades, including a Golden Globe and Oscar.

Truman Capote, under assignment from the New Yorker magazine, explores a terrible murder of a family of four in the American heartland. He asks his childhood friend from Monroeville Alabama, Nelle Harper Lee, to act as his assistant and together they will explore the murder and its impact on the community for a magazine article. Phillip Seymour Hoffman delivers the acting performance of the year playing the role of the cognitively unique Capote. Catherine Keener was superb playing the solid strength of Harper Lee.When the killers are soon caught and Capote sees the half-Native American Perry Smith, an odd chemistry develops and Capote becomes obsessed with Smith. Yet Capote manipulates the two murderers and even pays for their first court appeal in order to obtain more information for the article that has now developed into a book. Clifton Collins is excellent in the role of Perry Smith and Chris Cooper is excellent as the head of the Kansas division of the FBI.Capote had a rare gift, the ability to make himself totally vulnerable through painful self revelation, so as to obtain entry into soul of his target. He does this with Smith and they begin a careful relationship whereby they reveal themselves to each other like chess players, each making careful calculated moves so as to obtain the maximum amount of information and manipulation of the other party.Harper Lee confronts Capote asking whether he has fallen in love with Perry Smith, but Capote says that he and Smith are the same person, only Capote ran out the 'front door' and Smith ran out the 'back door"".Capote names his book ""In Cold Blood"" but keeps this information from Perry Smith. Eventually you begin to realize that cold blood is the mental state that Capote had to assume to manipulate the killers long enough to extract the full story of the murders from them.As the book nears completion, Capote begins a mental breakdown. He may actually love Perry Smith and thus regrets his death but also he knows the execution must occur to bring closure to the book so it can be published. Thus when Capote wishes Smith to die he is cast into guilt and grief; but when he wishes Smith to live, he is cast into depression over the lack of closure of his masterpiece.One of the most wise plot devices in this film was to contrast the fall of Capote with the rise of Harper Lee and her wonderful novel ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".  Capote sinks into depression and alcoholism laced with mounting self pity while Harper Lee gains acclaim first for her novel and then for the film starring Gregory Peck. On the night of the gala opening of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" Capote attends the festivities in a drunken depressed stupor and is so self absorbed that he can't even offer his supportive best friend, Lee, congratulations on her novel and film.What do we make of this film?  It is incredibly well done and demonstrates that no act of mercy is totally pure, no act of cruelty is totally evil.  It was Capote's incredible skills that allowed him to manipulate the killers to gain the story that made him the most famous American living writer; but he sold his soul to buy the story and he never recovered from the wound.This is mature film-making at its best!",5,The rise and fall of a great talent,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,3353,"['Believe', 'when', 'tell', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'complex', 'multi-layered', 'work', 'art', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'assignment', 'New', 'Yorker', 'magazine', 'terrible', 'murder', 'family', 'four', 'American', 'heartland', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Monroeville', 'Alabama', 'Nelle', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'act', 'assistant', 'together', 'will', 'explore', 'murder', 'impact', 'community', 'magazine', 'article', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'acting', 'performance', 'year', 'playing', 'role', 'cognitively', 'unique', 'Capote', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'was', 'superb', 'playing', 'solid', 'strength', 'Harper', 'Lee.When', 'killers', 'are', 'soon', 'caught', 'Capote', 'half-Native', 'American', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'odd', 'chemistry', 'develops', 'Capote', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'two', 'murderers', 'even', 'pays', 'first', 'court', 'appeal', 'order', 'obtain', 'more', 'information', 'article', 'now', 'developed', 'book', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'excellent', 'role', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'excellent', 'head', 'Kansas', 'division', 'FBI.Capote', 'had', 'rare', 'gift', 'ability', 'make', 'totally', 'vulnerable', 'painful', 'self', 'revelation', 'so', 'obtain', 'entry', 'soul', 'target', 'Smith', 'begin', 'careful', 'relationship', 'whereby', 'reveal', 'other', 'chess', 'players', 'making', 'careful', 'calculated', 'moves', 'so', 'obtain', 'maximum', 'amount', 'information', 'manipulation', 'other', 'party.Harper', 'Lee', 'confronts', 'Capote', 'asking', 'fallen', 'love', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'Smith', 'are', 'same', 'person', 'only', 'Capote', 'ran', 'out', ""'front"", 'door', 'Smith', 'ran', 'out', ""'back"", 'door', '.Capote', 'book', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'information', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Eventually', 'begin', 'realize', 'cold', 'blood', 'mental', 'state', 'Capote', 'had', 'assume', 'manipulate', 'killers', 'long', 'enough', 'extract', 'full', 'story', 'murders', 'book', 'completion', 'Capote', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'may', 'actually', 'love', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'thus', 'regrets', 'death', 'also', 'execution', 'must', 'occur', 'bring', 'closure', 'book', 'can', 'be', 'published', 'Thus', 'when', 'Capote', 'Smith', 'die', 'cast', 'guilt', 'grief', 'when', 'Smith', 'live', 'cast', 'depression', 'lack', 'closure', 'masterpiece.One', 'most', 'wise', 'plot', 'devices', 'film', 'was', 'contrast', 'fall', 'Capote', 'rise', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Capote', 'sinks', 'depression', 'alcoholism', 'laced', 'mounting', 'pity', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'gains', 'acclaim', 'first', 'novel', 'then', 'film', 'starring', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'night', 'gala', 'opening', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Capote', 'festivities', 'drunken', 'depressed', 'stupor', 'so', 'self', 'absorbed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'offer', 'supportive', 'best', 'friend', 'Lee', 'congratulations', 'novel', 'film.What', 'do', 'make', 'film', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'act', 'mercy', 'totally', 'pure', 'act', 'cruelty', 'totally', 'evil', 'was', 'Capote', 'incredible', 'skills', 'allowed', 'manipulate', 'killers', 'gain', 'story', 'made', 'most', 'famous', 'American', 'living', 'writer', 'sold', 'soul', 'buy', 'story', 'never', 'recovered', 'wound.This', 'mature', 'film-making', 'best']",N/A

But that isn't what makes it daring. What makes Capote daring is that it doesn't take a deconstructionist approach to the subject matter. In this age of hip, irreverent self-referentialism, the conventional approach would have been to have Truman Capote step in and out of his own story, talking directly to the audience about his state of mind in an effort to give the film a sardonic edge. Capote doesn't do this; it follows a linear narrative structure, depending on mood, facial expressions, subtle dialogue and somber interaction to make its points. As a result, it is a more captivating thesis on writing than, say, Adaptation(not that Adaptation isn't good).Capote takes the audience on a dense journey into a writer's mind, particularly the ugly side, the insecurities, the egotism, the exploitation of  close acquaintances, the damaged relationships, the detached facades, the emotional coldness and moral ambivalence. Despite all that, Truman Capote comes across as a likable character. Flawed, without a doubt, but undeniably intriguing.I haven't even mentioned Philip Seymour Hoffman's indelible performance. I'm convinced that his Capote is the kind of performance that will be talked about for years. Whether or not it is an accurate depiction of the real Truman Capote is practically irrelevant(I've heard that it is, but I'm not familiar enough with the character to make that call). What matters is that Hoffman manages such a complete transformation of his voice and mannerisms while not coming across as an overdone caricature, and that he communicates so much both nonverbally and through the WAY he says things rather than what he actually says. In real life, there is a constant dichotomy between what people say and what they really feel, really mean. Few films explore this, but Hoffman's performance is a textbook example of complex acting, creating a multi-dimensional character.Capote isn't a perfect film. The music score is hackneyed and many scenes drag on longer than they need to. Minor quibbles when the overall impact is so powerful.

Wilson,"[2, 2]","Capote is a rare thing: a beautifully shot film that subtly develops its characters through action and dialogue.And that's really about it.It's not necessarily a bad thing, though. The story's okay, and the acting is good, of course, but those things are not nearly as compelling as the way this film develops the character of Truman Capote. I think what I like best about this character development is that the movie doesn't try to be an all-encompassing biography likeRay (Widescreen Edition). It gives us a snapshot into Capote's life by showing him during a four-year period, concentrating almost completely on the writing ofIn Cold Blood. It's not a biopic by any means, and yet I think it defines Truman Capote much better than most biopics do with their main characters. Give me a subtle movie like Capote over a drawn out life of a celebrity any day.I'm not saying it's perfect, for in some ways, the story drags on. As Capote waits to find out what happens to the killers, we the audience wait with him, wondering what will happen. It's kind of like being stuck on the ship in the middle of the Atlantic inMaster and Commander - The Far Side of the World (Widescreen Edition). The main character's in limbo, so we're in limbo, too. But Capote manages to pick up the pace again rather quickly, and we watch with Capote as he witnesses what appears to become a seminal event in his life. The events of the novel Capote writes aren't that interesting, either, and watching Capote become a part of the killers' lives is only partially interesting.

Second, if you're expecting a bio-pic, forget it, this is a romanticized account of famed American icon Capote and how his life was ""forever changed"" by the events that influenced his infamous novel, ""In Cold Blood.""  Great cinematography underlines the moody and stark themes contained within.  My only complaint:  the film tries to cover too much, too quickly, with mixed results.  For example, the empathy Capote feels for the killers occurs with such rapidity it doesn't allow the audience to catch up...then there's the ongoing distraction of Capote's infectious personality, which could in all fairness, be a film within itself.  When all is said and done, it is quite difficult to care for these killers, given the heinousness of their crimes, especially when Perry retells how he slit the throat of the father...and the tragedy and humanity of it are only superficially hinted at so that the bottom line is that it just leaves one feeling, well, a bit inpatient (as Capote was) for it all to end.  Still, this film tries very hard to give a screenplay treatment to a myriad of feelings that might be better handled in a novel.  Also, given Harper Lee's reknowned reclusiveness, a big plus of this film is getting to know her....if in fact the portrayal is accurate (we will never really know)....Thematically, she is the conscience of the film, which is sort of an overused Atticus Finch analogy.

In CAPOTE, we get to see the story from Capote point of view. How he got the inside track? How he went from shunned and ignored in the little Kansas town, to friend with special insider priveledge to interview and get to know the witnesses, friends of the victims and of course, the killers.What we truly see, isn't how it's done, but what it did to Capote. How manipulating his way into the lives of the people in his book affected his personality and how becoming friends to the killers, misleading them as to what his true intentions were and then having to explain himself as he waited for them to be put to death.There's something incredibly deep, challenging and thought-provoking that comes across in Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance that it almost demands to be seen.

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[0, 2]","Author Truman Capote, he of fluff ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" fame, throttled the literary world by going into an altogether different - and certainly uncharacteristic - direction in his subsequent work ""In Cold Blood."" But the direction his work took him, not only according to this unsettling bio-drama and other corraborative accounts, was into moral and ethical disintegration. And, by his life's end, Capote's post-""In Cold Blood"" professional and personal meltdown cost him his very soul. Such is the excrutiating pain in this, screenwriter Dan Futterman's depiction of Capote's life in the seven-year period (1959-66) that ""In Cold Blood"" consumed Capote, beginning the weekend of Nov. 14, 1959, in America's rural Bible Belt where a farming family of four in Holcomb, Kan., was methodically slaughtered, and beyond the executions April 14, 1965, of the two killers. A New York Times story about the savage murders caught the attention of Capote, then a free lance writer for Vanity Fair and basking in his recent claim to fame courtesy of ""Breakfast ..."" From New York, Capote sets out for Kansas with a colleague, Harper Lee, herself unknowingly on the verge of literary acclaim with her work, ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" In gaining the trust and help of the locals despite his ""flamboyancy,"" Capote also earns the same from his subjects, killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. But in getting what he needs from his subjects, Capote sacrifices both his professional and personal ethics and morals, and it is that which is the basis for this film, deservedly rated as one of 2005's best movies. In the title role, Philip Seymour Hoffman validates his Best Actor Oscar by ingeniously aoviding the pathetic parody that could have been made of Capote's life. So absolutely convincing is Hoffman as Capote that we have to remind ourselves that who we're seeing isn't the real man. ""Capote,"" however, doesn't answer but alludes to why the real man sacrificed his moral and ethical direction, be it for another shot of self-serving fame or because he developed a risky - and costly - personal relationship with one of the killers (Smith). But the film doesn't claim to answer that question and instead focuses on the dynamics of Capote's meltdown. Caught in his fallout is co-writer Harper Lee, Capote's quiet voice of conscience and logic, and actress Catherine Keener serves up an Oscar-caliber performance as well. As Capote disintegrates privately, Lee rises professionaly to literary legend status with ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" and so self-abosrbed is Capote that he cannot share in his friend's professional success. And it is one of Capote's comments to himself, at the premier of the film version of Lee's literary masterpiece, that makes us uneasy with what Capote had apparently become: of his colleague's novel, Capote mutters, ""I frankly don't see what the fuss is all about."" By film's end, after the execution of both his subjects, Capote is on a plane headed back to New York and - we also are led to conclude - into irretrievable moral and ethical condemnation. In portraying Capote, Hoffman superbly rises above mere mimicking of his subject and presents Capote as a complex and psychologically torn but self-absorbed man who got too close as a writer to his story's sources and, in the process, tragically compromised his own soul. Through it all, however, and years after Capote's death, ""In Cold Blood"" nonetheless has gained classic status and, arguably perhaps, Capote never bettered himself before or after. And this film is justly regarded as one of the best of 2005, and it and Hoffman's unsettling but masterful performance are must-see's.",4,A moral and ethical meltdown,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,3660,"['Author', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'fluff', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'fame', 'throttled', 'literary', 'world', 'going', 'altogether', 'different', 'certainly', 'uncharacteristic', 'direction', 'subsequent', 'work', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'direction', 'work', 'took', 'not', 'only', 'according', 'unsettling', 'bio-drama', 'other', 'corraborative', 'accounts', 'was', 'moral', 'ethical', 'disintegration', 'life', 'end', 'Capote', 'post-', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'professional', 'personal', 'meltdown', 'cost', 'very', 'soul', 'Such', 'excrutiating', 'pain', 'screenwriter', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'depiction', 'Capote', 'life', 'seven-year', 'period', '1959-66', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'consumed', 'Capote', 'beginning', 'weekend', 'Nov.', '14', '1959', 'America', 'rural', 'Bible', 'Belt', 'where', 'farming', 'family', 'four', 'Holcomb', 'Kan.', 'was', 'methodically', 'slaughtered', 'executions', 'April', '14', '1965', 'two', 'killers', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'story', 'savage', 'murders', 'caught', 'attention', 'Capote', 'then', 'free', 'lance', 'writer', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'basking', 'recent', 'claim', 'fame', 'courtesy', 'Breakfast', 'New', 'York', 'Capote', 'out', 'Kansas', 'colleague', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'unknowingly', 'verge', 'literary', 'acclaim', 'work', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'gaining', 'trust', 'help', 'locals', 'flamboyancy', 'Capote', 'also', 'same', 'subjects', 'killers', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Dick', 'Hickock', 'getting', 'what', 'subjects', 'Capote', 'professional', 'personal', 'ethics', 'morals', 'basis', 'film', 'deservedly', 'rated', 'one', '2005', 'best', 'movies', 'title', 'role', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'ingeniously', 'aoviding', 'pathetic', 'parody', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Capote', 'life', 'So', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'have', 'remind', 'who', ""'re"", 'seeing', ""n't"", 'real', 'man', 'Capote', 'however', ""n't"", 'answer', 'alludes', 'why', 'real', 'man', 'sacrificed', 'moral', 'ethical', 'direction', 'be', 'shot', 'self-serving', 'fame', 'developed', 'risky', 'costly', 'personal', 'relationship', 'one', 'killers', 'Smith', 'film', ""n't"", 'claim', 'answer', 'question', 'instead', 'focuses', 'dynamics', 'Capote', 'meltdown', 'Caught', 'fallout', 'co-writer', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Capote', 'quiet', 'voice', 'conscience', 'logic', 'actress', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'up', 'Oscar-caliber', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Capote', 'privately', 'Lee', 'professionaly', 'literary', 'legend', 'status', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'so', 'self-abosrbed', 'Capote', 'can', 'not', 'share', 'friend', 'professional', 'success', 'one', 'Capote', 'comments', 'premier', 'film', 'version', 'Lee', 'literary', 'masterpiece', 'uneasy', 'what', 'Capote', 'had', 'apparently', 'become', 'colleague', 'novel', 'Capote', 'mutters', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'film', 'end', 'execution', 'subjects', 'Capote', 'plane', 'headed', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'also', 'are', 'led', 'conclude', 'irretrievable', 'moral', 'ethical', 'condemnation', 'portraying', 'Capote', 'Hoffman', 'superbly', 'mere', 'mimicking', 'subject', 'presents', 'Capote', 'complex', 'psychologically', 'torn', 'self-absorbed', 'man', 'who', 'got', 'too', 'close', 'writer', 'story', 'sources', 'process', 'tragically', 'compromised', 'own', 'soul', 'however', 'years', 'Capote', 'death', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'nonetheless', 'gained', 'classic', 'status', 'arguably', 'perhaps', 'Capote', 'never', 'bettered', 'film', 'justly', 'regarded', 'one', 'best', '2005', 'Hoffman', 'unsettling', 'masterful', 'performance', 'are', 'must-see']",N/A

It's not until he befriends one of the killers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), that the crimes and their repercussions really begin to affect him and, eventually, seem to poison him.Screenwriter Dan Futterman has adapted Gerald Clarke's biography in a straightforward manner that feels a little like a procedural, and first-time director Bennett Miller has a real touch for capturing washed-out rooms, haunted faces and gloomily atmospheric landscapes. No matter when or where you see it, ""Capote"" is a chilly Sunday night of a movie.The actors are equally low-key and deft. Collins (who looks a little like Robert Downey Jr. sharing the same face with Steve Buscemi) drifts swiftly between seeming sympathetic and shamelessly pragmatic; and Catherine Keener is endearing, if a little underused, as Harper Lee.But as good as all the other elements are, this is really Hoffman's show. He's built differently than Capote (he's an inch under six feet and Capote was 5'3"") but Miller uses seamless techniques to make him appear smaller than his surroundings. The rest of the performance, however, is no trick: Hoffman both channels the author's famous quirks and presents a spot-on portrait of a writer who gets exactly what he hoped for, but figures out too late it wasn't at all what he needed.",4,"""...He headed for home, and the day's work, unaware that it would be his last.""

DeRiemer,"[1, 2]","At the start of the movie, I would have given a lot to be standing next to Truman Capote at his party, both of us half drunk, listening to his anecdotes and trading quips with him. At the end of the movie, I wouldn't have wanted to be in the same room with him.Capote is a major motion picture, in my view, with a great, mesmerizing performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote. Hoffman doesn't just mimic Capote's languid lisp and effeminate mannerisms. He captures the man's drive, his ambition, his empathy, his charm, his determination to get what he wants. What Capote wants is to write a book, and the book is going to be the story of the slaughter of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas, by two drifters, Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.). The two broke into the Clutter's home because they'd heard there was $10,000 hidden. They tied up Herb Clutter and his 15-year-old son, Kenyon, and took them to the basement. They tied up Bonnie Clutter and the 16-year-old daughter, Nancy, and left them upstairs. After searching the house and finding no hidden cash, Hickock intended to rape Nancy. Smith stopped him...but then slit Herb Clutter's throat and used a shotgun to blast his head. Then Smith used the shotgun on the son, the mother and the daughter. They left with only about $50.Capote and Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), a friend acting as his assistant, travel to Holcomb and spend three months talking to everyone they can find, from Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the cop in charge, to the teen-agers who knew the young Clutters. After Hickock and Smith are captured, Capote develops a strange, almost intimate, relationship with Smith. ""It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house,"" he says at one point, ""and one day he went out the back door and I went out the front."" He is writing what he knows will be a great book, but it can have no ending until Perry finally breaks down and tells him what happened the night of the killings. And it still will have no end until, all appeals having failed, Hickock and Perry are hanged. Years go by. To get this story, Capote will use and manipulate Perry, a man more vulnerable than we might think. Capote lies to him, uses emotional blackmail, perhaps even believes himself some of the emotions he is displaying to Perry. But all the while, Capote's ambition and ruthlessness to write his story never waver, no matter how emotionally wrenching it has become for him. Of course, he does get the story, Perry and Hickock are hanged and In Cold Blood becomes one of the masterpieces of American literature.Hoffman manages to evoke a reluctant admiration for Capote. If you've ever seen the photo of Capote used on the dust jacket of his first novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms, there is no doubt that the man is flamboyant and amused by people's reaction to his distinctiveness. There's also no doubt that as a teen-ager, Capote probably was unmercifully treated by his peers. One can't help but admire Capote's talent and his single-mindedness, or be repelled by his willingness to do just about anything to get the story and write his book.Hoffman gives an extraordinary performance. Also excellent are so many others in the cast, particularly Chris Cooper, Clifton Collins, Jr. and Catherine Keener.

Hastily embarking to Kansas accompanied by Catherine Keener, wonderfully playing childhood friend and esteemed author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", Harper Lee they proceed to interview all the important participants of the investigation.Capote gains the confidence of the accused killers Richard Hickcock played by Mark Pellegrino and especially Perry Smith played by Clifton Collins Jr.  Capote empathized with Smith having had similar childhood experiences of being unwanted and shunned.  Capote however would have no compunction in resorting to manipulation and lying to glean precious information to help him complete his book.Capote in effect sells his soul in seducing and befriending the killers and helping then legally.  In the end can't bring himself to face them at the eve of their execution.  Finally relenting, he witnesses the graphic hanging of Perry Smith. He is shattered but reminded by Keener, as his voice of reason, that he never wanted to really save them and deny himself the precious ending of his book.  We learn that this five year expenditure of Capote's time and effort has dried up his creativity.  He never again wrote another book.",5,Hoffman's groundbreaking performance,1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,1762,"['Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'uncannily', 'stunning', 'mesmerizing', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'portrayal', 'celebrated', 'author', 'personality', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'capturing', 'nuances', 'multi', 'faceted', 'personality', 'Having', 'seen', 'Capote', 'speak', 'many', 'occasions', 'Hoffman', 'speech', 'patterns', 'mannerisms', 'appearance', 'were', 'eerily', 'authentic.Hoffman', 'performance', 'point', 'Capote', 'career', 'when', 'was', 'researching', 'creating', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'novel', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'Capote', 'looking', 'new', 'interesting', 'subject', 'was', 'intrigued', 'brutal', 'shotgun', 'slaying', 'rural', 'Kansas', 'farming', 'family', 'four', 'Hastily', 'embarking', 'Kansas', 'accompanied', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'wonderfully', 'playing', 'childhood', 'friend', 'esteemed', 'author', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'proceed', 'interview', 'important', 'participants', 'investigation.Capote', 'gains', 'confidence', 'accused', 'killers', 'Richard', 'Hickcock', 'played', 'Mark', 'Pellegrino', 'especially', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'played', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Capote', 'empathized', 'Smith', 'having', 'had', 'similar', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'being', 'unwanted', 'shunned', 'Capote', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'compunction', 'resorting', 'manipulation', 'lying', 'glean', 'precious', 'information', 'help', 'complete', 'book.Capote', 'effect', 'soul', 'seducing', 'befriending', 'killers', 'helping', 'then', 'legally', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'face', 'eve', 'execution', 'Finally', 'relenting', 'graphic', 'hanging', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'shattered', 'reminded', 'Keener', 'voice', 'reason', 'never', 'wanted', 'really', 'save', 'deny', 'precious', 'ending', 'book', 'learn', 'five', 'year', 'expenditure', 'Capote', 'time', 'effort', 'dried', 'up', 'creativity', 'never', 'again', 'wrote', 'book']",N/A
966814,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000E33VWW,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","The only reason to make a film about someone as controversially repugnant as Truman Capote would be to illuminate his greatest quality- his superb prose writing. At his best, Capote was one of last century's greatest wordsmiths. Instead, the current film, Capote, focuses on the lesser things the man was known for- his showmanship, sensationalism, and homosexuality- although in that last category what is shown is tame and watered down. Now, I'm not saying that a full fledged swordfight between Philip Seymour Hoffman (who plays Capote) and Bruce Greenwood (who plays his lover Jack Dunphy) was necessary, but since the film focuses on the six years Capote was researching and writing his 1965 non-fiction novel In Cold Blood, because of his homoerotic attraction for one of the two killers the book follows, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.), it would have illuminated something more about the man. Of course, what creative processes were behind Capote's creation of what he termed `a whole new form of writing'- the `non-fiction novel'- would have been even better.That said, these elements, which are the fault of the screenplay by Dan Futterman, adapted from Gerald Clarke's biography Capote, are the only things that keep this good film from greatness. All the rest of it, including the direction by Bennett Miller, is superb, starting with Hoffman's stab at the icon. This is not a hagiography, and the film makes several wise choices, of which showing Capote's flaws is one. Another excellent choice is to not do a cradle to grave biopic. By focusing only on a few year period it allows us a look at a pivotal point in the character's life. But why, then, not go deeper into the creative processes of the artist? Why not try to provide some insight into why this meek, little man would be so attracted to an amoral thug? Manifestly, there is nothing left to get at with the November 15th, 1959, Holcomb, Kansas murders of the Clutter clan by Smith and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino). As with Leopold and Loeb, before them, and any number of spree killers after them, they are relative ciphers. So, why Capote's need to `understand' them, especially Smith, if not the homo-eroticism? Unless the whole point of the film is to show us Capote as a vampire, waiting for the pair's execution so he could have a good ending for his book.Yet, there was so much more to be mined- Capote's relationship with Jack Dunphy- both as a lover and artist. Considering that Dunphy was not in a league with Capote as a writer would have made their dynamic all the more interesting, as well giving the criminally underrated Greenwood (so good in the cult tv series Nowhere Man and as JFK in the Kevin Costner film Thirteen Days) a chance to show his considerable acting chops in a major role, in an arts house film. Another waste was the whole presence of Capote's childhood friend, Catherine Keener's (Nelle) Harper Lee character, despite her solid portrayal, especially considering her own one hit wonder, To Kill A Mockingbird, was big right at this time.... A final point, though, and that is with the title of the film. Given the wise decision to not go cradle to grave, why such an all-encompassing title? Why not something more specific and germane to what is onscreen? As with much else in the film, such as Hoffman's over-hyped, but solid, performance, it is these little niggles and wrong turns that make so much of what the film does right go wrong enough to just miss being something truly great.",3,Solid biopic,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,3499,"['only', 'reason', 'make', 'film', 'about', 'someone', 'controversially', 'repugnant', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'would', 'be', 'illuminate', 'greatest', 'quality-', 'superb', 'prose', 'writing', 'best', 'Capote', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'century', 'greatest', 'wordsmiths', 'Instead', 'current', 'film', 'Capote', 'lesser', 'things', 'man', 'was', 'known', 'for-', 'showmanship', 'sensationalism', 'homosexuality-', 'last', 'category', 'what', 'shown', 'tame', 'watered', 'down', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'full', 'fledged', 'swordfight', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'Capote', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'who', 'lover', 'Jack', 'Dunphy', 'was', 'necessary', 'film', 'six', 'years', 'Capote', 'was', 'researching', 'writing', '1965', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'homoerotic', 'attraction', 'one', 'two', 'killers', 'book', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'would', 'have', 'illuminated', 'something', 'more', 'man', 'course', 'what', 'creative', 'processes', 'were', 'Capote', 'creation', 'what', 'termed', 'whole', 'new', 'form', ""writing'-"", 'non-fiction', ""novel'-"", 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'said', 'elements', 'are', 'fault', 'screenplay', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'adapted', 'Gerald', 'Clarke', 'biography', 'Capote', 'are', 'only', 'things', 'keep', 'good', 'film', 'greatness', 'rest', 'including', 'direction', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'superb', 'starting', 'Hoffman', 'stab', 'icon', 'not', 'hagiography', 'film', 'several', 'wise', 'choices', 'showing', 'Capote', 'flaws', 'one', 'excellent', 'choice', 'not', 'do', 'cradle', 'grave', 'biopic', 'focusing', 'only', 'few', 'year', 'period', 'look', 'pivotal', 'point', 'character', 'life', 'why', 'then', 'not', 'go', 'deeper', 'creative', 'processes', 'artist', 'Why', 'not', 'try', 'provide', 'insight', 'why', 'meek', 'little', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'attracted', 'amoral', 'thug', 'Manifestly', 'nothing', 'left', 'get', 'November', '15th', '1959', 'Holcomb', 'Kansas', 'murders', 'Clutter', 'clan', 'Smith', 'Dick', 'Hickock', 'Mark', 'Pellegrino', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'number', 'spree', 'killers', 'are', 'relative', 'ciphers', 'So', 'why', 'Capote', 'need', 'understand', 'especially', 'Smith', 'not', 'homo-eroticism', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'show', 'Capote', 'vampire', 'waiting', 'pair', 'execution', 'could', 'have', 'good', 'ending', 'book.Yet', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'be', 'mined-', 'Capote', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'Dunphy-', 'lover', 'artist', 'Considering', 'Dunphy', 'was', 'not', 'league', 'Capote', 'writer', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'dynamic', 'more', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'Greenwood', 'so', 'good', 'cult', 'tv', 'series', 'Nowhere', 'Man', 'JFK', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'film', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'chance', 'show', 'considerable', 'acting', 'chops', 'major', 'role', 'arts', 'house', 'film', 'waste', 'was', 'whole', 'presence', 'Capote', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Nelle', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'character', 'solid', 'portrayal', 'especially', 'considering', 'own', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'was', 'big', 'right', 'time', 'final', 'point', 'title', 'film', 'Given', 'wise', 'decision', 'not', 'go', 'cradle', 'grave', 'why', 'such', 'all-encompassing', 'title', 'Why', 'not', 'something', 'more', 'specific', 'germane', 'what', 'onscreen', 'much', 'else', 'film', 'such', 'Hoffman', 'over-hyped', 'solid', 'performance', 'little', 'niggles', 'wrong', 'turns', 'make', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'film', 'right', 'go', 'wrong', 'enough', 'just', 'miss', 'being', 'something', 'truly', 'great']",N/A

966816,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000E33VWW,Craig Matteson,"[2, 3]","I can only provide you with my personal reactions and interpretations of this film.  The intentions of the authors, director, and actors are unknown to me, but what I saw on the screen affected me quite powerfully.  For me, this quiet intenisty is exactly what I most like in film.  One of the things an author must do is see.  To write truthfully an author cannot blink or look away or distract by making sensational effects.  Think of the scene of Capote alone in the funeral parlor with the closed coffins containing the bodies of the family.  Does the author look inside or does his respect and sense of decorum keep the lids closed.  There is not a simple answer or act for anyone of sensitivity.This movie is much like that.  The pictures it shows us are clean, spare, and give us time to look at and into what is going on.  In this movie, facial expressions matter a great deal.  A movement of an eyebrow, a flicker of an emotion that escapes and is then suppressed communicates so much.  Am I reading meaning into the performances?  Maybe.  But the movie gives me the opportunity to see and, well, luxuriate in thought about what is happening inside these people.Of course, the movie is about Capote and he is on the screen nearly constantly.  Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is so intelligent, so powerfully imaginative, and communicates so continually that I can almost not understand how he accomplished it.  Capote is an immensely complex character.  We see his public bravado and understand its balance with his private insecurities.  However, there is not a simple relationship between the two.  One isn't the cause of the other.Capote is completely able to tell a truth with a lie and then to lie with telling the truth.  We see him genuinely ache for the killer Perry Smith while still manipulating him to get what he wants.  When Capote gets a real and serious lawyer for the killers he may allow himself to feel that he is doing it out of compassion for these men and the fellowship he feels for Smith because of their shared childhood abandonment.  Yet, Capote also knows that he needs to keep them alive long enough to extract their stories and get at the truth so he can write his book.For me, the most amazing scenes in the film are Capote's private exchanges with Smith (and great credit has to be given to Clifton Collins, Jr for his contributions to these scenes).  Capote uses genuine emotion to charismatically pull in Smith.  At other times, he creates a negative emotional pressure that almost forces the emotion within Smith to come out and fill it.  Another time Capote will user superiority and near contempt to manipulate the needy child in Smith.  Yet, in the end, Capote is caught in his own trap.  Capote has to finish his book and for him to do that they murderers need to die.  Yet, Capote's getting them lawyers started them down the path of appeal after appeal and stay after stay.  Finally, Capote has to withdraw any more assistance for Hickock and Smith.  Yet, in abandoning them his own conscience burns and all but destroys him.  When you see his life after ""In Cold Blood"" one could make the argument that it did him in.Of course, Hoffman's fabulous performance could not exist without other great artists to perform with.  The entire cast of this movie is just wonderful.  Catherine Keener as Harper Lee is perfect as Capote's friend who knows him for what he really is and loves him anyway, but not to the point of self-deception.  Bob Balaban is wonderful and knowing as, William Shawn, the legendary editor of the New Yorker.  He also knows how to manage and manipulate Capote, but is also drawn into this final miserable web of the execution.  Bruce Greenwood's sensitive portrayal of Capote's closest love, Jack Dunphy, allows us to see that as self-involved and capable of hurting others as Capote was, at the extremes he did need another and that was Dunphy.  Chris Cooper and Amy Ryan add so much as the Kansas detective and his wife who are both taken in by Capote's charisma and fame while the detective retrains some distance and skepticism of Capote's ultimate motivation.The rest of the cast is also wonderful and I praise this movie without reservation.The ""R"" rating comes from some profane language (not a lot) and a brief scene of brutality and blood when the murders are finally recounted.",5,A magnificent film with amazing performances of great nuance and power,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,4359,"['can', 'only', 'provide', 'personal', 'reactions', 'interpretations', 'film', 'intentions', 'authors', 'director', 'actors', 'are', 'unknown', 'what', 'saw', 'screen', 'affected', 'quite', 'powerfully', 'quiet', 'intenisty', 'exactly', 'what', 'most', 'film', 'One', 'things', 'author', 'must', 'do', 'see', 'write', 'truthfully', 'author', 'can', 'not', 'blink', 'look', 'away', 'distract', 'making', 'sensational', 'effects', 'Think', 'scene', 'Capote', 'alone', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'closed', 'coffins', 'containing', 'bodies', 'family', 'author', 'look', 'respect', 'sense', 'decorum', 'keep', 'lids', 'closed', 'not', 'simple', 'answer', 'act', 'anyone', 'sensitivity.This', 'movie', 'much', 'pictures', 'are', 'clean', 'spare', 'give', 'time', 'look', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'facial', 'expressions', 'matter', 'great', 'deal', 'movement', 'eyebrow', 'flicker', 'emotion', 'escapes', 'then', 'suppressed', 'communicates', 'so', 'much', 'Am', 'reading', 'meaning', 'performances', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'see', 'well', 'luxuriate', 'thought', 'what', 'happening', 'people.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'Capote', 'screen', 'nearly', 'constantly', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'so', 'intelligent', 'so', 'powerfully', 'imaginative', 'communicates', 'so', 'continually', 'can', 'almost', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'accomplished', 'Capote', 'immensely', 'complex', 'character', 'see', 'public', 'bravado', 'understand', 'balance', 'private', 'insecurities', 'However', 'not', 'simple', 'relationship', 'two', 'One', ""n't"", 'cause', 'other.Capote', 'completely', 'able', 'tell', 'truth', 'lie', 'then', 'lie', 'telling', 'truth', 'see', 'genuinely', 'ache', 'killer', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'still', 'manipulating', 'get', 'what', 'When', 'Capote', 'real', 'serious', 'lawyer', 'killers', 'may', 'allow', 'feel', 'doing', 'compassion', 'men', 'fellowship', 'Smith', 'shared', 'childhood', 'abandonment', 'Capote', 'also', 'keep', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'extract', 'stories', 'get', 'truth', 'can', 'write', 'book.For', 'most', 'amazing', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'Capote', 'private', 'exchanges', 'Smith', 'great', 'credit', 'be', 'given', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr', 'contributions', 'scenes', 'Capote', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'charismatically', 'pull', 'Smith', 'other', 'times', 'negative', 'emotional', 'pressure', 'almost', 'emotion', 'Smith', 'come', 'out', 'fill', 'time', 'Capote', 'will', 'user', 'superiority', 'contempt', 'manipulate', 'needy', 'child', 'Smith', 'end', 'Capote', 'caught', 'own', 'trap', 'Capote', 'finish', 'book', 'do', 'murderers', 'need', 'die', 'Capote', 'getting', 'lawyers', 'started', 'down', 'path', 'appeal', 'appeal', 'stay', 'stay', 'Finally', 'Capote', 'withdraw', 'more', 'assistance', 'Hickock', 'Smith', 'abandoning', 'own', 'conscience', 'burns', 'When', 'see', 'life', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'argument', 'did', 'in.Of', 'course', 'Hoffman', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'could', 'not', 'exist', 'other', 'great', 'artists', 'perform', 'entire', 'cast', 'movie', 'just', 'wonderful', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'perfect', 'Capote', 'friend', 'who', 'what', 'really', 'anyway', 'not', 'point', 'self-deception', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'wonderful', 'knowing', 'William', 'Shawn', 'legendary', 'editor', 'New', 'Yorker', 'also', 'how', 'manage', 'manipulate', 'Capote', 'also', 'drawn', 'final', 'miserable', 'web', 'execution', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'Capote', 'closest', 'love', 'Jack', 'Dunphy', 'see', 'self-involved', 'capable', 'hurting', 'others', 'Capote', 'was', 'extremes', 'did', 'need', 'was', 'Dunphy', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'Kansas', 'detective', 'wife', 'who', 'are', 'taken', 'Capote', 'charisma', 'fame', 'detective', 'distance', 'skepticism', 'Capote', 'ultimate', 'motivation.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'wonderful', 'praise', 'movie', 'reservation.The', 'R', 'rating', 'profane', 'language', 'not', 'lot', 'brief', 'scene', 'brutality', 'blood', 'when', 'murders', 'are', 'finally', 'recounted']",N/A

This necessarily dreary movie concerns itself with those several years in Capote's celebrated life that revolved around his writing the novel In Cold Blood. Here we see goings-on covered in neither the novel nor film version of In Cold Blood, as Capote befriends Perry Smith, one of two criminals who savagely slew a Kansas family inside its farmhouse. Capote is portrayed here as a troubled, conflicted individual, who both uses Smith to gain information possible only if he has Smith's trust, and also as someone who does seem to genuinely care for Smith, whom he visits during his incarceration on death row. Capote's sexual orientation is not made an issue here and is in fact barely touched upon. Likewise the victimization suffered in the dark past of the psychopathic Smith, which played a significant role in In Cold Blood, is mostly left out. Chris Cooper is sound as the Kansas sheriff who cracks the case of the killings, and one thing wrong with this film is how Capote's near-betrayal of the Sheriff and others who had helped Capote during the formative period of his book is barely mentioned. Truman Capote as portrayed in this film seems a would-be amoral  artist whose conscience won't let him get away clean with all that he does in the name of his art. He'll use people, it's true, but he'll later feel tortured by it. This complexity is intriguing.

966822,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000E33VWW,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 2]","`Capote' chronicles the efforts of author Truman Capote as he researches for his last completed book.  That last book was the non-fiction novel `In Cold Blood' which delved into the murder of a Kansas family on November 14th 1959.  On that fateful day two men broke into the Clutter home and murdered everyone home.  This event rocked the country, but most of all it drove Truman Capote mad with obsession as he struggled to create the greatest piece of literature ever written.  Truman succeeded in a sense, for `In Cold Blood' made him one of, if not the most famous author in America, but it's not the book itself but the journey to completion that this film presents to us, and it does so masterfully.What makes this film as effective as it is is its attention to detail.  First of all the entire film is shot in very subtle tones.  Everything is quite, from the voices to the eerie score by Mychael Danna; everything is almost in an undertone.  Nothing is overbearing but it all adds to the feel of growing obsession.  The opening scene, where a young girl finds the dead body of her best friend, is a perfect example of what I mean.  The scene is shot with such composure and lucidity that you're almost not sure what you've just seen.  Not many films with this dark a subject attack a project like this with such candor and grace, but director Bennett Miller shows so much caution and delicacy with each approach that you swear he's mastered his talent.  He approaches this film, not with the `in your face' antics that most if not all crime noirs use but he gives us a stripped down raw feel.The score, that constant piano playing is light and background, never breaking the surface and steeling the spotlight but playing perfect companion to the lucid feeling of the film.As Capote (Hoffman) hears first hears of the murders he's immediately intrigued.  He has been waiting for an inspiration, something to sink his creative teeth into and so he decides that an article for the New Yorker on the effect this crime has had on the small Kansas community may be the answer.  He travels along with fellow author and friend Nell Harper Lee (Keener) to Holcomb Kansas to interview the townsfolk, but what he finds is far more than he had anticipated.  Capote, upon meeting the accused, immediately forms a bond with one of the men, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and begins to interview him excessively, furthering his fascination, and, in a sick weird way, his love interest.  Capote goes as far as to get the two men a new lawyer, one that can properly defend them.  This gesture is portrayed to mean one of two things, and the film helps you lean towards one, yet never letting go of the other.  Either Truman wants them around to finish his book or he really has fallen for this killer.  As Truman says himself, it can't be both.Truman's obsession with this case and the men involved starts to put a strain on his relationships, most of all with his boyfriend Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood), but also with Nell as he becomes somewhat self-obsessed and or absorbed.  Truman is painted as a very self-centered man, and this is shown in a few different ways.  One is the fact that whenever other people are around Truman is always shown as the one doing the talking, almost as if he's entertained by the sound of his own voice.  In actuality, while Catherine Keener received a `Best Supporting Actress' nod for her performance (and it was astonishing) she really didn't do too much talking.  Capote completely controlled a conversation.  Another way his self-love is shown is in the way he pays others to compliment him, as if to boost his own self-confidence and make himself desirable to others.  And the final way, or at least the largest display, is the way he could turn any occasion into his occasion, as is seen when he visits the movie premier for Nell's `To Kill a Mockingbird' and he can't `pretend' to be having a good time, not even for her sake.  Her face, her eyes, her final words to him ""what did you think of the movie"" say everything.The acting in this film, while yes it is what you may call impression acting, is superbly done, notably by Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman who embodied the role of Truman Capote and delivered on every level.  His eyes do a lot of talking in this film, and to me, my favorite scene is another subtle yet powerful one, and one of the scenes I use to prove how powerful this film is in all its calm nature.  The scene where Truman visits the morgue to see the slain is especially prominent, for as he lifts the mothers coffin and looks at her body we can see his soul.  Hoffman, in this scene, with just his eyes portrays a level of understanding and mortification that far surpasses that of `over-acting' and `melodramatics' for if he had made any movements at all, made any sounds or started to cry he would have lost all affect in my opinion, but it was his blank stare and monotone stance that drove home every point we needed.As a whole, this film is exceptionally executed, brilliantly acted, directed and scripted and is, not just a great movie but also an exceptional work of art.  I'd highly recommend the viewing of this docudrama for it opens the eyes and the mind and helps us all see what one man worked so hard for us to understand.  The last few frames are crushing as we watch everything this man wish for come true in shocking realizations that made him make the very statement I chose for my title...

Clendenin,"[1, 1]","Philip Seymour Hoffman stars as the (in)famous writer Truman Capote (1924-1984) in one of the best films of the year, despite the problems of viewer identification that it might provoke. In researching his ""non-fiction novel"" In Cold Blood Capote befriended a young man who was convicted and eventually executed for the brutal murder of a Kansas family of four. The portrait of Capote that emerges is of a flamboyant artistic genius whose deeply complex personality reveals itself in decidedly mixed motives. He attracts, repels and fascinates us, all at the same time. In the film Capote befriends the young prisoner Perry Smith for at least four conflicting reasons. Capote was egotistical, vain, narcissistic, condescending and ambitious. Several times he lied to Smith in order to exploit him for selfish, professional purposes in writing his book. When asked if he ""esteemed"" Smith, Capote replies, ""he's a gold mine."" Second, Capote's gay lover Jack jealously accused him of falling in love with Smith, which also seems to be true. Third, interviewing Smith evoked powerful memories of his own childhood that resulted in an obsessive act of self-identification and emotional attachment with him: ""it's as if we grew up in the same house, but he went out the front door and I went out the back."" These memories include exclusion as an outsider, family suicide, alcoholism, and parental abandonment. Finally, Capote genuinely empathized for the young death row inmate, and the film provokes themes of social justice revolving around our penal system and pity for a criminal with a horrible childhood. Smith is not a monster, he insists, and Capote intends his book to ""return him to the realm of humanity."" Still, Capote chose not to do all that he might have to save Smith; he even wanted Smith to die to supply an ending for his book. When the film ends we learn that In Cold Blood remained an unfinished novel, and that it was the last book that Capote ever wrote, even though he lived another eighteen years. Badly missing in this remarkable film--the slightest mention of the murdered victims and their families.

""Capote"" is the story of the writer's efforts to chronicle the saga of two killers who murder a prominent small-town Kansas farming family after burglarizing their home in a futile search for money.  On assignment for the New Yorker magazine, Capote is accompanied by childhood friend Harper Lee, who serves as an effective buffer between Capote's effete sophistication (which many find distasteful) and the staid conservatism of 1960's Middle America. Most strikingly, ""Capote"" portrays the mammoth moral struggle of the writer, who was at once calculating, coldly manipulative and then deeply sympathetic about the plight of the two killers, one of whom he befriends and gradually coaxes to tell his story.  The tremendous fame and wealth from the resulting book ""In Cold Blood"" did little to offset the enormous emotional and psychological cost of writing it.  Indeed, the film strongly suggests that Capote made a (faustian) bargain with the devil and never really recovered, finally succumbing to alcholism in 1984.  The great supporting cast includes Clifton Collins, Jr.--who personifies small-time desperation as one of the surprisingly articulate killers and Catherine Keener, who simmers as Capote's stoic, long-suffering friend, sidekick and unintentional rival Harper Lee, who herself becomes nearly as famous as Capote for a time after penning ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""  ""Capote"" is a serious study--definitely not a ""family film.""  Director Bennett Miller's brief but arresting images of the violence (murder, execution) prick the heart. Hoffman, who was one of the best things in the 1999 psychological thriller ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (in which he portrayed a loyal, suspicious friend whose skepticism proves fatal) gives one of the most powerful performances in recent memory--it's a masterful tribute to one of the most brilliantly tragic figures in American literary history.",4,Great performance. . . .,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,2026,"['Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'so', 'totally', 'role', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'characterization', 'Capote', 'story', 'writer', 'efforts', 'chronicle', 'saga', 'two', 'killers', 'who', 'murder', 'prominent', 'small-town', 'Kansas', 'farming', 'family', 'burglarizing', 'home', 'futile', 'search', 'money', 'assignment', 'New', 'Yorker', 'magazine', 'Capote', 'accompanied', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'who', 'effective', 'buffer', 'Capote', 'effete', 'sophistication', 'many', 'find', 'distasteful', 'staid', 'conservatism', '1960', 'Middle', 'America', 'Most', 'strikingly', 'Capote', 'mammoth', 'moral', 'struggle', 'writer', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'calculating', 'coldly', 'manipulative', 'then', 'deeply', 'sympathetic', 'plight', 'two', 'killers', 'one', 'whom', 'gradually', 'coaxes', 'tell', 'story', 'tremendous', 'fame', 'wealth', 'resulting', 'book', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'did', 'little', 'offset', 'enormous', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'cost', 'writing', 'Indeed', 'film', 'strongly', 'Capote', 'made', 'faustian', 'bargain', 'devil', 'never', 'really', 'recovered', 'finally', 'succumbing', 'alcholism', '1984', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'who', 'small-time', 'desperation', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'articulate', 'killers', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'who', 'Capote', 'stoic', 'long-suffering', 'friend', 'sidekick', 'unintentional', 'rival', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'who', 'becomes', 'nearly', 'as', 'famous', 'Capote', 'time', 'penning', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Capote', 'serious', 'study', 'definitely', 'not', 'family', 'film', 'Director', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'brief', 'arresting', 'images', 'violence', 'murder', 'execution', 'heart', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'things', '1999', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'portrayed', 'loyal', 'suspicious', 'friend', 'skepticism', 'fatal', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'performances', 'recent', 'memory', 'masterful', 'tribute', 'one', 'most', 'brilliantly', 'tragic', 'figures', 'American', 'literary', 'history']",N/A

Something clearly intrigues the artistic mind about this little man, who as shown in this film was a little, awful man. He is depicted here as a manipulator and user. He got in with the killers out in Kansas and then pretended to care in order to get their story, in much the same way he had squeezed reticent Marlon Brando for a story about his alcoholic mother. This is a very well made little picture, supremely well-acted by Hoffman, who has been growing year by year into a formidable actor. Just think of that awful little fat boy in ""Boogie Nights"" and consider how far he has come, giving here one of the great performances of the decade. He is a brave, daring actor, fearless really, and willing to go where few of our handsome leading men are willing to venture. His imitation of Capote is at times spot-on, eerily accurate and yet dynamically singular. The film too has merit. It is a tragedy about a tragedy.

There don't seem to be too many reviewers who have addressed this issue (maybe I'm just showing my age), but anyone who has already seen Richard Brooks' 1967 theatrical treatment of Truman Capote's true crime masterwork is bound to watch ""Capote"" with more than a little sense of deja vu. Yes, I know we are talking apples and oranges thematically-""In Cold Blood"" was a psychological study of the killers, ""Capote"" is a psycological study of thier biographer. Still, ""Capote"" begs comparisons (especially when its final shots are basically a frame-by-frame recreation of ""In Cold Blood""'s closing scene.) If you can get past that (I guess I couldn't), there are excellent performances here (Phillip Seymour Hoffman's immersion into character is spooky good as always), but they are somewhat tempered by the film's deliberate, glacial pacing. Not that I was expecting car chases, but in my viewing experience, movies that attempt to dissect the writer's mind tend to run into a bit of trouble in the narrative department (witness ""Henry and June"", ""Naked Lunch"", ""Adaptation"", ""Barton Fink"").

966832,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000E33VWW,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 10]","All writers---even those of us on the lowest level of the totem pole---subject themselves to moments of intense reflection where the telling of the story from different emotional and rational vantage points simply overwhelms and neutralizes their real world existence.  The aspiration to endow a piece of writing with as much realism as possible equates to countless hours of research where the writer loses himself as he attempts to juxtapose facts from the concrete universe with those rare intermittent lightning strikes of artistic creation that are born in the Valhalla of imagination.  In certain circumstances, the experience plunges the writer into dangerous `heart of darkness' territory where his sentinels of morality shirk their duty and allow their charge to freefall, perhaps irrevocably jeopardizing the very soul desirous of immortality.In the 2005 biopic, ""Capote,"" director Bennett Miller focuses on this process and its repercussions by concentrating on five years in the life of the charismatic and unconventional Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as he germinates and brings to malevolent life a new genre of literature, the quintessential non-fiction true crime epitomized by his brainchild ""In Cold Blood"" published in 1966.From the opening sequences, we recognize Capote as an electro-magnet of social attention, reigning over raucous Holly Golightly-ish parties with a wavering lit cigarette while enjoying the sound of his own chalk-to-the-blackboard drawl dropping power names that appeared on the Who's Who list of that era with a Southern boy's charm of sounding not only intimate but just plain neighborly.  However, Miller quickly switches from the communal to the cerebral.  Piqued by a short article in the New York Times printed in November 1959, Capote tells New Yorker editor William Shawn (Bob Balaban) that he wishes to write an article exploring the impact of the brutal murder of the well-to-do Clutter family of Holcomb, Kansas on the small mid-western town and its sense of morality.  Accompanied by his research assistant, Nelle Harper Lee (of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" fame) (Catherine Keener), the eccentric Capote arrives in middle America, where all his blatant accrued New York verve puts him at odds with the less blaring local color.  Again, his gossipy social skills and his ability to reveal the darker aspects of his rather less than happy childhood allow him to burrow his idiosyncratic way into the homes and hearts of the town's inhabitants that will best help him appropriate the most exacting detail to fashion characters and circumstances for his thrilling and introspective account of the crime.Capote's manipulative skills wax diabolical once Capote sets eyes on Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr), one of the two ex-cons who perpetrated the crime.  Sensing that with his similar background and his need for recognition, Perry may indeed be the living representation of a darker Capote, Capote cannot help but empathizes with him.  He admits to Harper Lee that he feels as if they were both brought up in the same house, only that he, Capote, went out the front door while Perry went out the back.  As Capote is hell-bent to discover what really occurred in the Clutter house on that fall November evening to endow his non-fiction novel with as much gruesome reality as possible, he tries his darnedest to entrap Perry with the accoutrements of friendship---finding him a lawyer for his appeal, spoon-feeding him through a hunger strike and constantly visiting him for the duration of his prison stay.  As time goes on, however, Capote wishes only to finish the book.  The stays of execution that he helped perpetuate gum up his final vision and in spite of his obsession with his subject, he desperately desires only for the state of Kansas to put him and these criminals out of their misery.  The success of `In Cold Blood"" speaks for itself, but the toll it takes on Capote is intimated by the film's printed after message noting Capote's descent into alcoholism and his inability to finish another book.On a purely theatrical level, the film's players succeed in bringing an intensely complex psychological study to life without a moment's boredom.  Amazingly, actor Hoffman visibly shrinks as Capote; his huge frame somehow manages to suggest the 5'4"" literary dynamo and at the same time implies an aspect of decay not quite actively present during the depicted time period.  Instead, the viewer senses its initial metastasis beneath the surface like an erosion of ethical behavior attributed more blatantly to the visage of the figure in the attic portrait of Dorian Gray.  The lisping baby voice, the affected broken wrist gestures, the Southern drawl, the New York mannerisms all contribute to the illusion Hoffman successfully effectuates.  At first, these seem too theatrical even for Hoffman whose upper crust Freddy Miles in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" albeit true to character bordered on the obnoxious.  That is until the real Capote seems to take possession like a spirit inhabiting a medium.  Hoffman becomes Capote so much so that the viewer has difficulty distinguishing between the actor and subject.Bruce Greenwood, as Capote's long term partner and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee act as our human barometers, aiding us in accessing Capote's true intent while ferociously taking his story to its inevitable conclusion.  We watch them roll their eyes and exchange knowing glances and understand that on some level they perceive Capote's unraveling even before he does.  They exercise patience with Capote's genius and fully comprehend that the obsession that accompanies the hypo-manic personality can only fail on some lesser human plane.  Gravitating towards that dark place holds no sway with their far more contented souls.As Perry, Clifton Collins, Jr. smolders with dual natures both tender and repulsive.  The audience senses his desire for acknowledgement and then cringes when his eyes turn black with suspicion and inner rage for his own misfortunate fate.  The dark intensity of his inner visions acts as a perfect foil for Hoffman's pink and pouty relentlessness.  The two orbit around each other like the blue hot double star Sirius in a macabre dance of eclipsing yearning that drains the audience with almost as much ferocity as its two participants.Bottom line:  Director Bennett Miller constructs a fascinating two-hour study of the process an artist undergoes to give birth to his creation.  Exploring Capote's mind as it unearths the facts necessary to assemble ""In Cold Blood"" reveals that the selfishness, the desire for perfection, the condoning of deception and the necessity to retreat from the commonplace world that all writers on any level must endure exist in varying degrees in us all and unfortunately take their toll with our dealings in the real life arena of people and circumstance.

966837,A3PCZKVZIXZ1WM,B000E33VWW,"Donna Delaune ""donnaread""","[2, 2]","Great DVD, with good special features.It took me a long time to get around to watching this wonderful movie, and I am truly sorry I waited so song.  CAPOTE is without a doubt one of the best films of 2005. Though I had not previously been a Heath Ledger fan, I found it hard to believe that anyone could out-do his outstanding performance in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  I was wrong.  Philip Seymour Hoffman was astounding as Truman Capote.  BUT its not just his portrayal of Capote that astounded me.  There are probably many actors who could have done as well, after all its easy to portray a 'real' person, especially someone who was in the public eye as much as Capote was.  He's been photographed and filmed so many times, all one has to do is study these films. The reason I believe Hoffman deserved the best actor OSCAR was because of the scene in the movie where Capote says goodbye to the killers.  This scene just absolutely took my breath away, literally.  The emotion and pain on his face was gut-wrenching.  Hoffman himself appeared to have trouble breathing.  I've never seen anything like it in my life!Capote himself was such a flamboyant and charismatic person, that Hoffman had to walk a fine line in order to avoid turning Capote into a caricature of the real man.  In the special features of the DVD, director Bennett Miller tells of his discussion with Hoffman about how he should play the 'goodbye' scene.  Hoffman thought it would be 'too much' for him to break down, and the director gave him leeway to play it as he 'felt' it.  Well, he blew me away.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","&#34;In Cold Blood&#34; is one of the most fascinating works of American literature -- a book that blurs the boundaries of fiction and nonfiction.But the writing of the book is almost as fascinating as the events that inspired it, especially since the two became intertwined. This forms the core of &#34;Capote,&#34; a fascinating look at the writing project that overwhelmed Truman Capote's life -- and while the movie is quite solid, it's the late Philip Seymour Hoffman who truly shines.Writer Truman Capote (Hoffman) sees a small article in the newspaper, about a family who has been murdered in Kansas, and is immediately inspired to write about it for the New Yorker. Along with his friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), he sets out for Kansas and begins interviewing people who knew the Clutter family. They even get to know Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the detective on the case.Then the murderers are caught -- a pair of troubled thugs, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard &#34;Dick&#34; Hickock (Mark Pellegrino).Suddenly Capote is inspired to take his story far beyond its roots, and his New Yorker story begins to blossom into a full-length book. As he interviews the two men, a warped bond begins to form between Capote and Smith, whom he sees as a kindred spirit.... even though he hasn't revealed how his book will be written. But as the years and legal battles go on, he becomes more determined to finish it at last.The late Philip Seymour Hoffman won an Academy Award for his performance as Truman Capote, and it isn't hard to see why. He seems to slip into Capote's skin -- his looks, his high nasal voice, his fey mannerisms -- but he also fills the cracks with lots of genuine emotion. His Capote is both vulnerable and manipulative -- and thankfully, director Bennett Miller is intelligent enough to realize that neither eclipses the other.On one hand, Capote seems to feel a true connection to Perry, as if they are two sides of the same coin -- in one scene, he plaintively tells Harper Lee that he and Perry came from the same house, and that he went &#34;out the front door&#34; while Perry was forced to leave via &#34;the back.&#34; But the movie doesn't shy away from the suggestion that Capote manipulated the convicted men to get the book he wanted, although the extent is left ambiguous.And as the movie winds on, Hoffman's Capote seems to be slowly crumbling under the weight of his magnificent book that he's producing, as if it's vampirically sucking out his vital juices. At the end, he's emotionally and creatively spent, adrift, left only with the reflections of his darker self.As a recounting of &#34;what happened,&#34; the film is actually pretty close to the reality of what happened -- it follows Capote closely as he winds his way through the Kansas town, with Harper paving the way before his feet. Miller mostly depends on Hoffman for atmosphere, letting him fill the scenes with emotion or intensity -- but he brings a tautness to phone calls, a darkness in the executions, and a sense of barely-restrained violence when the convicts are onscreen.The other actors are all pretty good, although they are effectively window dressing for Hoffman -- Catherine Keener is the only one who truly rises above the herd, depicting Lee as a sharp, smart, incisive woman whom Capote leans on.&#34;Capote&#34; is one of those movies that is elevated to brilliance by the presence of a truly great actor -- and the director's delicate, nuanced touch with Capote's psyche doesn't hurt either.",5,... while I went out the front.,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,3534,"['34', 'Cold', 'Blood', '34', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'works', 'American', 'literature', 'book', 'boundaries', 'fiction', 'nonfiction.But', 'writing', 'book', 'almost', 'as', 'fascinating', 'events', 'inspired', 'especially', 'two', 'became', 'intertwined', 'core', '34', 'Capote', '34', 'fascinating', 'look', 'writing', 'project', 'overwhelmed', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'life', 'movie', 'quite', 'solid', 'late', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'truly', 'shines.Writer', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Hoffman', 'small', 'article', 'newspaper', 'family', 'who', 'been', 'murdered', 'Kansas', 'immediately', 'inspired', 'write', 'New', 'Yorker', 'friend', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'out', 'Kansas', 'interviewing', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Clutter', 'family', 'even', 'get', 'know', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'detective', 'case.Then', 'murderers', 'are', 'caught', 'pair', 'troubled', 'thugs', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Richard', '34', 'Dick', '34', 'Hickock', 'Mark', 'Pellegrino', '.Suddenly', 'Capote', 'inspired', 'take', 'story', 'far', 'roots', 'New', 'Yorker', 'story', 'blossom', 'full-length', 'book', 'two', 'men', 'warped', 'bond', 'form', 'Capote', 'Smith', 'whom', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'even', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'how', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'written', 'years', 'legal', 'battles', 'go', 'more', 'determined', 'finish', 'last.The', 'late', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'Truman', 'Capote', ""n't"", 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'slip', 'Capote', 'skin', 'looks', 'high', 'nasal', 'voice', 'fey', 'mannerisms', 'also', 'cracks', 'lots', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'Capote', 'vulnerable', 'manipulative', 'thankfully', 'director', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'realize', 'other.On', 'one', 'hand', 'Capote', 'feel', 'true', 'connection', 'Perry', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'coin', 'one', 'scene', 'plaintively', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Perry', 'came', 'same', 'house', 'went', '34', 'front', 'door', '34', 'Perry', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', '34', 'back.', '34', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'suggestion', 'Capote', 'manipulated', 'convicted', 'men', 'get', 'book', 'wanted', 'extent', 'left', 'ambiguous.And', 'movie', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'be', 'slowly', 'crumbling', 'weight', 'magnificent', 'book', 'producing', 'vampirically', 'sucking', 'out', 'vital', 'juices', 'end', 'emotionally', 'creatively', 'spent', 'adrift', 'left', 'only', 'reflections', 'darker', 'self.As', 'recounting', '34', 'what', 'happened', '34', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'close', 'reality', 'what', 'happened', 'Capote', 'closely', 'way', 'Kansas', 'town', 'Harper', 'paving', 'way', 'feet', 'Miller', 'mostly', 'Hoffman', 'atmosphere', 'letting', 'fill', 'scenes', 'emotion', 'intensity', 'tautness', 'phone', 'calls', 'darkness', 'executions', 'sense', 'barely-restrained', 'violence', 'when', 'convicts', 'are', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'effectively', 'window', 'dressing', 'Hoffman', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'rises', 'herd', 'depicting', 'Lee', 'sharp', 'smart', 'incisive', 'woman', 'whom', 'Capote', 'on.', '34', 'Capote', '34', 'one', 'movies', 'elevated', 'brilliance', 'presence', 'truly', 'great', 'actor', 'director', 'delicate', 'nuanced', 'touch', 'Capote', 'psyche', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either']",N/A

I've long admired his fine acting, reminds me of Paul Giametti who's another immensely talented yet not terribly well-publicized actor because he isn't very photogenic and would hardly qualify for male-bimbo status like a Tom Cruise nor does he have the generic ""all-American"" mainstream appeal of a Harrison Ford or Kevin Costner.  Both excel at playing slightly (or not so slightly) unhinged characters.In this film, Hoffman does a phenomenal job on Truman Capote---especially in the scene just before the execution at the end of the film.  His face just flows so effortlessly from one emotion and mood to the next, expresses a combination of conflicting emotions perfectly.Catherine Keener is another highly talented and under-recognized actress who shines in this film, here she actually plays a relatively normal straight-laced woman for a change rather than her usual shrewish characters.  Chris Cooper and Clifford Collins round out the flawless cast.  The cinematography and editing are done well---this film like Capote's writing has a both spare/austere and sensuous quality which keeps your attention riveted.  Very fast 2 hours.Best of all is the lack of any sugarcoating on the simple fact that for Capote to get the story that he wanted to write, he had to bribe, manipulate, and lie between his teeth to his subject.  There is also no sugarcoating the fact that aside from being a ruthless journalist in doing his job, Capote was also a classic self-absorbed narcissist driven by a hunger for recognition and fame.  All the same, like his novel's portrayal of these Kansas killers, Capote is shown to be neither a devil nor a saint but simply what he is---human.

966846,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000E33VWW,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","Although he was a celebrated author, I have to admit my initial familiarity with Truman Capote came from his frequent appearances during the 1970's on ""The Tonight Show"" with Johnny Carson, as well as his silly appearance as duplicitous millionaire Lionel Twain in Neil Simon's 1978 ""Murder by Death"". Capote's effete manner and often patronizing comments (e.g., he opined that all actors were basically stupid) made such a strong impression on me that it was not until much later that I realized he wrote such gems such as ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""The Grass Harp"", ""The Thanksgiving Visitor"", and of course, his seemingly atypical masterwork, ""In Cold Blood"". It is the intensive research and writing of this latter work, a self-proclaimed ""non-fiction novel"" published to great acclaim in 1965, which is the basis of this well-crafted though sometimes slowly paced movie.For those who have not read ""In Cold Blood"" or seen the stark 1967 film adaptation directed by Richard Brooks, the true-life story focuses on Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, a pair of drifters who break into the home of a Kansas farm family in November 1959 based on a rumor that they had $10,000 stashed away. Upon discovering that the family had no money on hand, Smith and Hickock systematically killed the four members of the family.  First-time director Bennett Miller recreates much of the book's plot, including the gory crime, within the context of the movie. On a broader level, this film focuses on Capote's journey of over four years in chronicling the story until the inevitable ending, and in the meantime getting to know the killers intimately, especially the more enigmatic Smith. Actor Dan Futterman, familiar from his guest turns on ""Will and Grace"" and ""Sex in the City"", has written a delicately balanced screenplay that highlights the contradictory forces with which Capote was grappling in getting his story on paper.Although Miller's direction and Futterman's script are both strong for rookie efforts, the key to the film's effectiveness lies in the performances. In a startling transformation, Philip Seymour Hoffman inhabits Capote from the most subtle mannerism to his inner soul. Always a fine character actor, Hoffman brings his dead-on impersonation to a level of consciousness that exudes just the right shadings of narcissism, vulnerability and self-destruction. From the snippets of Capote regaling cocktail party guests in Manhattan with his stories to his useless wardrobe name-dropping in Kansas, there is no question in Hoffman's performance that Capote is a man in love with himself. As author Harper Lee, Capote's closest confidante and research partner on the killings, the always watchable Catherine Keener unaffectedly presents the sturdiness of her plain-spoken character, and their close, painfully honest relationship is believable.The other striking performance is provided by Clifton Collins Jr., who brings out the alternating coldness and vulnerability in Smith, especially as his character naively and desperately comes to regard Capote as his friend. The prison cell scenes between Hoffman and Collins have an intriguing, disturbing charge that subconsciously seems to point to the homoerotic nature of their relationship. Smaller roles are filled expertly - Chris Cooper in familiar territory as Sheriff Alvin Dewey and Bruce Greenwood as Capote's patient lover, author Jack Dunphy - though their scenes feel truncated compared to the rest of the story. In fact, the film feels rushed toward the end as Capote is obviously deeply affected by the events and his own culpability in the killers' fate.

He did everthing in his power to get as much research to create thie book.  It took him years to finish the book due to the fact that Perry Smith, one of the convicted killers, wouldnt' tell Capote details about the crimes he committed.I think ""Capote"" is one of the best films to come out of 2005.

That one created real shock waves in that we lived in Boulder, Colorado. which was only a couple hundred miles away and the killers remained free for a while. A second thing was that I had enrolled in graduate school far away in Seattle. I knew no one, had no friends and nothing to do other than school work. It was one of those periods in my life when I lost myself in reading. One of my favored authors was Truman Capote and I read a couple of his books. ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"" come to mind. I remember being startled when I learned of Capote going to Kansas to research the situation in order to white a book about the grisly crime and the convicted killers. It seemed totally out of character and I couldn't imagine what type of book would come out of this situation. Well, the resulting book was the very highly acclaimed ""In Cold Blood"" and Capote was informally crowned America's greatest living author.I never got around to reading ""In Cold Blood"" as I was then deeply into my latter days of graduate school and the early years of my career as a professor. Likewise, when the movie ""Capote"" came out, I just wasn't into going to movies. Lately, my wife and I have been watching movies late at night on DVDs. So, I was scratching through the ultra-bargain DVD shelf in a Ross store and there was the ""Capote"" DVD and I snapped it up immediately. Strangely, my wife refused to watch it in that she didn't like the idea of a family getting murdered. I tried to explain, but it was no use. I watched it last night while she was at a baby shower. The movie was simply outstanding!Several things stand out about the movie ""Capote."" One was the directing and the magnificent capturing of the stark beauty of western Kansas and the depiction of the people. Outstanding! Secondly, I've seen Truman Capote on talk shows many times and, of course, he's a completely unique and easily recognized personality. Well, Philip Seymour Hoffman did an absolutely stunning job of portraying Capote in the movie. There were times when he was so close in looks and voice, that I'd almost swear that it actually was Capote. Surely, this was acting at it's finest!The story of ""Capote"" unfolded in a somewhat grim documentary style, but it fit the situation perfectly and I felt no lapse of attention at any point in the movie. All acting was excellent! The story was completely believable and made for compelling viewing. The movie left me with deep emotional feelings, even for the hapless killers.

966863,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000E33VWW,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","CAPOTE is a great movie.  Let that be said at the beginning of this review.  The superb screenplay by Dan Futterman based on the book by Gerald Clarke in turn based on that part of the  life of Truman Capote when he was obsessed with writing his final and finest novel 'In Cold Blood', and the extraordinary directing by Bennett Miller who influenced a fine production crew and coaxed brilliant performances from his cast is all a well established fact.  That all of this could be brought together in the featurettes that accompany the film on the DVD release is an example of just how fine additive commentaries can be. This is not only a superb film; it is also an equally superb DVD package.Philip Seymour Hoffman as the idiosyncratic author Truman Capote probes the psyche of this strange but gifted writer from his first newspaper clipping of the November 15, 1959 brutal murders of the Clutter family in Holbrook through his immersion in the tiny Kansas town accompanied by his friend and fellow writer Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) absorbing the atmosphere where such a deed could happen, ingratiating himself with investigator Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) and his wife Marie (Amy Ryan) to gain access to information that will eventually result in material for his projected book.  He becomes obsessed with the murderers Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), connecting with Smith in particular on a very basic level and providing the men with lawyers to appeal their conviction for a long enough time to eventually hear the truth of the night of grisly mayhem that fascinates Capote so. The story ends with the execution of Smith and Hickock in 1965, an occasion that further bewilders the now fragile mind of Capote as he gains the end to his story while simultaneously watching the loved Smith dangle from the scaffold in death.  Each actor is exceptional here: Hoffman does indeed deserve his Oscar for a brilliant portrayal.But it is the aftermath that brings even more poignancy to the film.  Hearing Bennett, Clarke, and Futterman discuss the origin of the cinematic idea blends naturally with the production crews' commentary about the choice of Winnipeg, Canada as the location to depict Kansas, the thorough preparation of the design and costuming and color palette and camera techniques, and then the comments by four of the main actors (Hoffman, Keener, Cooper, and Collins) illuminate not only the characters they depicted in the film but also the dynamics of entering into this strange world of bleak winter murder.  The effect of the featurettes is staggering and makes the viewer want to immediately replay the entire movie.This DVD package should serve as the template for future releases: the disc in its entirety is an art form that has few peers.

I considered giving it four stars seeing the average amazon rating but no, in order for me to right a faithful description of this movie, I must mention..Capote contains some beautiful sets. It's not an expensive film, I liked how the character Capote is introduced, also liked how he speaks and his character definition and how precisely the director has depicted his state of mind. In the end, I thought the film seemed a tad too realistic and thus, looked dull. However, it is what is meant to be, a documentary'ish depiction of a columnist/author who decided to write a book on two killers. Later,he is stuck between going ahead and printing his book (In Cold Blood) or fighting for the cause of the two convicts. He could have gone either way.Capote's character isnt overtly amusing, isnt too funny, it's his human side that will make you chuckle/semi grin now and then. I thought the depiction of 1959 to mid 1960's was simply superb considering it's a low budget venture.SEMI SPOILER ALTERT/WHAT I LIKED -I liked the scene in the film where Capote refuses to take Lee's phone call. I liked how he acknowledges a man's remark on the introductory speech of his book and later addresses him as his father.Overall, I felt Capote's character is a tad boring. I understand it's a real story and all, but in the end it seems a bit too realistic for a movie to stand.The film lacked irony, magical moments, whoa inducing twists or sequences, a consistent piano sound in the theme and a character that would be very likeable.Chris Cooper's role is rather yawn inducing. However, I MUST SAY, Capote is one of the most daring thin edged directed movies I have ever seen. There is very very little room for error and since I am a big time movie enthusiast(movie person too) I felt it somewhat wins it's battle.However, I got the message of the film, the facts of it, however, Where do I go from there?Possibly one of the best 3star films you'll ever see.

Blake captures the complexity of this extremely complicated murderer - for instance, the rage simmering just below the I-want-to-impress-you-with-my-vocabulary surface. Collins doesn't do nearly as well, his performance is flat, sort of wilted, we don't see that glimmer of Satan that Blake was able to produce. (If I remember correctly, Blake got way, way into the role, to the point where he became self-destructive.) Perry Smith is one of the biggest acting challenges of modern movies. In ""Capote"" it's a huge role. The conversations between him and Capote in the jail cell are the core of the film.

They represented the anguish, the febrile despair and expressed with absolute conviction their sarcastic and dark opinions about the future to come. Those diviner voices have always resulted unpleasant for a the most of people, because they are considered something like the uninvited guest, the unblessed angels, the lucidity of the conscious in its most cruel nakedness.Truman Capote was one of these voices. His naturalness at the moment to express awful truths deserved to him the expected results. But he was not the only on. You should add this list names of the height of Sinclair Lewis, Faulkner, Steinbeck, Hemingway, Steinbeck, Alan Ginsberg and Kerouac.This film portraits with admirable crudeness, those years in which the phantoms that still nestled in the mind of many people and permeated behaviors and attitudes of intransigence and repression as natural response to the recent wounds of the WW2.You should notice a similar phenomena happened in Germany; two names are enough to prove it: Gunther Grass and Peter Handke.It would be worthy to remark the fact the 2006 Academy Awards turned around the past (Brokeback mountain, Good night and good luck, Capote and Munich) indicate a visible process of cathartic depuration and an obvious need to analyze the traces of a recent past to realize many hidden aspects of the collective unconscious.Philip Seymour Hoffman has given securely the role of his lifetime. Regarding he is a young and talented actor, something inside me tells me he reached that genius trait, this sublime peak achieved for others actors. For instance George C. Scott with Patton, Anthony Hopkins with The silence of the lambs, Clift Robertson with Charly, Ben Kingsley with Gandhi, Broderick Crawford with All the king's men, Peter O'Toole with Lawrence of Arabia, or Jack Nicholson with One flew over the cuckoo' s nest.

966875,A24I3BMB9JZC7O,B000E33VWW,"Ingrid Heyn ""No man is an Iland, intire of it...","[6, 8]","The most terrifying thing about the film ""Capote"", which only began screening recently here in Australia, is that the title of ""monster"" is lifted to reveal the whole complex network of influences which play a part in human decisions.Why do killers kill? Many killers kill not because they consider themselves to be killers, but kill because their lives have led them to an increasing lack of respect for life, for the rights of other human beings to live unmolested and unharmed, for the necessity of any violent tendencies within oneself to be disciplined, and perhaps most importantly... for one not to confuse one's own feelings (considering oneself ""sympathetic"" and ""sensitive"") with genuine empathy, the genuine love for mankind that makes John Donne's famous sonnet with the oft-quoted phrase ""No man is an island, entire unto himself"" so stunningly apposite and powerfully true.The two killers whose acts brought murder into a quiet Kansas town became the raison d'tre for Truman Capote's new work. Previously, his writing had included lighter pieces as ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" - which is not exactly lacking in darker emotions and complexity, but is more geared towards a serio-romantic tradition. There was nothing romantic in the new book Truman Capote had in mind... the now-famous ""In Cold Blood"".This film is about the creation of that book and the nature and character of Truman Capote, increasingly revealed throughout the course of the film as the book and the interviews its writing entailed become all-consuming to him.Capote himself is depicted with brutal honesty - his self-centredness, his egocentric desire to be the centre of attention, his callousness in the face of the desperation desire to live, and to be understood, on the part of the two killers, his uninterest even in the success of his friend Harper Lee in the wake of the publishing of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", and his almost unbelievably expressed desire to have ""it"" over with (""it"" being the execution of the two killers).The complexity of this film is remarkably well done. It's beautifully paced, subtle and powerful - I note that some reviewers are dissatisfied with the film on the basis of its being too slow and too thoughtful, too lost in the moment. Perhaps to some viewers, accustomed to films in which hectic car chases follow one upon the other, and accustomed to reading the novels of Matthew Reilly, the film truly MAY be too slow for their liking. I can only say it worked beautifully for me. I was gripped by the story and its chilling unfolding from beginning to end.Capote's relationship with one of the killers - Perry Smith - is especially important. He is accused by his lover Jack of being in love with Perry, but also of using him. Capote is unable to grasp how both of these things could be true - but in the sense of ""love"" as understood by Capote's set, there is no difficulty.Perry Smith is a handsome young man, articulate, apparently sensitive, deeply aware of how he's perceived by others, craving respect and understanding. His diaries reveal that he fantasised about being admired by others - note his ""If called upon to make a speech"" entry. The murders of the father, mother, son and daughter were not committed out of hatred, desperation, necessity... and this is chilling. The line that divides us from monstrous deeds can be crossed at any moment by a decision or a reaction that takes less than the blink of an eye. And it is in Perry Smith's life that the film shows hints of what led to the murders - bit by bit, Perry Smith descended into increasingly antisocial activity, until finally, the man he'd tied up and was badgering for information on money in the house looked at him with terror. Looked at him with terror... and Perry Smith cut his throat.There WAS no reason. The internal callousness of this young man, who in many ways was sensitive and thoughtful, simply led to a knee-jerk act - and having committed the first murder, Perry Smith followed through with the other three murders almost as though in a trance.Was he mentally ill? No. Had he been driven to these murders? No. Did he gain anything by murdering? No. There is such a thin wall between acceptable behaviour and monstrous behaviour - and even the committer of the deed cannot explain why he did what he did. He looks at himself and sees, not a murderer, but a man tormented by having DONE something he cannot understand.Drawn into an attraction towards Perry Smith, and yet separate from Smith's emotions by his own insulating case of egocentricity, Capote clearly extracted as much information from the prisoner as he could. It is based upon this intimate understanding that the true chills of the ""In Cold Blood"" title of the book makes its most powerful appeal.But in this film ""Capote"", the coldness is uncannily apt with respect to Capote's own behaviour and emotions. He desperately wishes for the execution to be over, so that at last he can finish his book. The book MUST end with the finality of that execution - every stay of execution is like a deliberate affront to him, a deliberate attempt to torment him. His masterpiece must be published - this is the pivotal thought in Capote's mind.The cinematography is wonderfully done in this film. The directing - magnificent. I loved the pace of the film. And the acting... is so good that one forgets one is watching actors, not the real people.Having seen the film, I'm ordering the DVD. I can't say it's a ""feel good"" film - I can say it is powerful and thought-provoking, and the friend with whom I saw the film and I have found it richly working in our minds so that we have discussed it in depth.Very highly recommended.",5,The coldness of the soul... the chill of the fait accompli.,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,5688,"['most', 'terrifying', 'thing', 'film', 'Capote',

What I didn't realize when I read it, and seeing the movies made of it in between, was how much Capote identified with Perry Smith.  This revelation makes the movie worth watching in itself.  Capote says, ""I feel like Perry and I grew up in the same house, he walked out the back door, and I walked out the front.""  I think the identification is what made the book so powerful.  Capote began the category of writing now known I guess as Creative Non-Fiction, but what still floors me, is how much he gave of himself in creating the masterpiece.Capote did become a washout insidiously after the completion of the book.  What higher price can one pay for creating a great work of art?  It seems to me, that the creative genius in him was hung with Perry Smith.Incredible movie, a must see, I think.  I can't wait to buy it, and read the book again.The movie is not for everyone, it deals with grim material.

The film concentrates on Capote's interaction with the lead killer through the meetings he managed to arrange for them in jail. It explorers how researching the murder affected Capote and changed him forever.The film is remarkable! It captures the late '50s and early '60s impeccably with flawless set dressing and imposed film grain. Capote's interesting life was touched upon with certain aspects highlighted such as his friendship with Harper Lee--author of literary classic To Kill a Mockingbird--and his effiminacy.Philip Seymor Huffman should win an Oscar for his outstanding performance as Truman Capote. His accent, posture, gestures and most subtle inflections were perfection. He definitely delivered the best performance by an actor in a leading role this year thus far.Everyone should see this film!

Sondel - lover of the arts""","[2, 4]","Nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Director and Screenplay) ""Capote"" was my favorite film of 2005.  I thoroughly believe that in other, less talented hands, this film would have been a mess.  Director Bennett Miller has made a beautiful film with uniformly brilliant performances.  Without once drifting into gross caricature Philip Seymour Hoffman (who won the Oscar for his performance) did the impossible by bringing Capote the person and not Capote the persona to life.  Catherine Keener (an Oscar nominee for her work here) plays Nell Harper Lee with great understatement.  Chris Cooper as investigator Alvin Dewey, Clifton Collins Jr as murderer Perry Smith and Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, are equally effective in challenging roles.""Capote"" isn't easy.  This is not a standard Hollywood bio-pic.  It was never the intention of screenwriter Dan Futterman to adapt Gerald Clarke's exhaustive biography of Capote in its entirety, but rather to bring to the screen those chapters dealing with the author's life at the time he was compoing his true-crime masterpiece ""In Cold Blood.""Much fuss mas been made over the fact that Truman used Perry Smith and Dick Hickock in an exploitive way; that he ""needed"" them alive only long enough to reveal their side of things, and then executed in order to finish his book.  I'm not totally convinced that the author's actions were so cold or calculated.  I know from what I've read (and now seen) that Capote was truly conflicted about his obligation to these men.  He did pay for their first appeal.  Still, did he do all that he could to see that thier death sentence was commuted?  Was he actually honor bound to do more on their behalf?  Let us not forget the family of four who lay dead in that farm house - they were shown no mercy, given no appeals and certainly no stay of execution.  These are the issues the film brilliantly explores.  In the end ""Capote"" presents one of the most acutely realized and compelling examinations of personal and professional ethics in relation to the creative process, and the often corrupting influence the persuit of greatness can have on the artist.

966879,A2Y1SCM930PZI7,B000E33VWW,Jabberwocky,"[1, 1]","I always find it fascinating when two movies about the same topic come out very closely together. This has happened too many times for it to be coincidence. We had Dead Man on Campus vs. The Curve. Dangerous Liaisons vs. Valmont. Elizabeth vs. Shakespeare in Love. The Thin Red Line vs. Saving Private Ryan. Antz vs. A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo vs. A Shark's Tale Etc, etc. And now we have Capote vs. Infamous. Not just two movies with similar topics, but two movies that chronicle the exact same period of time about the exact same period of people, namely Truman Capote and the Kansas-family killers.ScorecardBetter at being Truman Capote---Philip Seymour Hoffman. Toby Jones had the advantage of looking more like Capote, and being more on point with Capote's mannerisms, but his performance comes off as mimicry. Hoffman doesn't mimic, he acts. Plus, he gets points for degree of difficulty. He doesn't look like Capote at all, but he pulls it off. He even manages to make Capote somewhat sexy.Better acting from the rest of the cast---Capote. With the exception of Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee, the rest of the Infamous cast is outshined by Capote's cast. Infamous has a lot of big names, but their parts are so minimal that it's almost a waste.Better Love story---Capote. The love story is a little too subtle, but the interaction between Capote's Truman and Smith works really well. Perry Smith is portrayed with more gentility, and it becomes believable Truman could have fell for him. Daniel Craig plays Perry Smith like a schizophrenic who at one point gags and threatens to rape Capote. That's not how you fall in love. The love angle is not believable at all in Infamous.Better script---Capote. The writing is tighter and more focused while Infamous's writing is a little jerky. We spend a little too much time with Truman's friends. And the interview style of the movie seems like a crutch. Capote was able to tell its story through action while Infamous needs the characters breaking the flow of the movie to tell the audience what's going on.Better movie---Capote. It is bleak but better directed, better acted, and better executed. Infamous has lighter and funnier moments, but it can at times come off as frivolous.I just wish Capote hadn't made Truman seem so evil. They play him entirely too ruthless and manipulative. And as a result, we are forced to sympathize with murderers of 4 innocent people.In situations like this, it becomes obvious that the quicker one to the punch gets rewarded.

Beginning with the Clutter family murders in rural Kansas and covering Capote's struggles to write In Cold Blood, the movie also has superb acting by Catherine Keener (last seen bringing sanity to the world of middle-aged male stupidity in 40 Year Old Virgin), the always estimable Chris Columbus, and Clifton Collins as Perry Smith, one of the killers and in this movie, the only one that matters. Five stars too to the director and cinematographer who superbly contrast the bleak winter open space of the Kansas prairie and the confining closeness of the jail scenes with Capote and one of the killers, Perry Smith. As good as he is in capturing Capote physically, Hoffman does even better with his psychological make-up. Charming, manipulative, and -- gradually -- in love with Smith, Capote is torn between wanting to save Smith's life and knowing he needs him dead for his book to have the ending it requires. One of the film's nicer twists is how this user also becomes the used -- meeting his match in Smith.There may be better movies than Capote in 2005, but they will surely be few in number, and frankly now, in mid-December, it's only rival to my mind is Brokeback Mountain.",5,Hoffman Channels Capote,1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,1409,"['How', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'read', 'somewhere', '6', '2', 'thoroughly', 'elfin', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'one', 'greater', 'acting', 'mysteries', 'year', 'result', 'Capote', 'terrific', 'movie', 'frame', 'Beginning', 'Clutter', 'family', 'murders', 'rural', 'Kansas', 'covering', 'Capote', 'struggles', 'write', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'movie', 'also', 'superb', 'acting', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'last', 'seen', 'bringing', 'sanity', 'world', 'middle-aged', 'male', 'stupidity', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'always', 'estimable', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'one', 'killers', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'Five', 'stars', 'too', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'who', 'superbly', 'contrast', 'bleak', 'winter', 'open', 'space', 'Kansas', 'prairie', 'confining', 'closeness', 'jail', 'scenes', 'Capote', 'one', 'killers', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'As', 'good', 'capturing', 'Capote', 'physically', 'Hoffman', 'even', 'better', 'psychological', 'make-up', 'Charming', 'manipulative', 'gradually', 'love', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'torn', 'wanting', 'save', 'Smith', 'life', 'knowing', 'dead', 'book', 'have', 'ending', 'One', 'film', 'nicer', 'twists', 'how', 'user', 'also', 'used', 'meeting', 'match', 'Smith.There', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'movies', 'Capote', '2005', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'few', 'number', 'frankly', 'now', 'mid-December', 'only', 'rival', 'mind', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain']",N/A
966883,AQ01Q3070LT29,B000E33VWW,James McDonald,"[0, 0]","Rated ""R"". Running Time: 1 hour, 54 mins.Truman Capote was an author of many short stories, novels, plays and non-fiction work. Known forBreakfast at Tiffany's: A Short Novel and Three Stories (Modern Library). He wrote for The New Yorker Magazine and was an actor inMurder By Death(1976) andAnnie Hall(1977).This movie begins on the day of November 14, 1959 when a family of four were murdered in their house in a small town in Kansas.After seeing the article about the crime in the newspaper, author Truman Capote decides to write about the crime and how it effected the small town of Holcomb, Texas.With his research partner, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), Truman goes to the small town to see the scene of the crime and talk with the girl, Laura (Allie Mikkelson), who found the body of her best friend.After the two murderers, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) are caught, Capote gets a chance to talk with Perry in a cell and then even attends the trial.Over the course of four years, Capote becomes friends with Perry Smith and visits him in prison. He tells the murderers he will help get them a lawyer. Unbeknownst to Perry Smith, Capote is trying to get answers out of him for his work.With all the material Capote has, he has decided to write a book,In Cold Blood (Modern Library), but because he was waiting for Perry Smith to finally open up and talk about the murders and wanting an ending of this case, the book was not published until 1966. The book was later adapted in the movie,In Cold Blood(1967) starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake.Also in the cast: Bruce Greenwood, Amy Ryan, Chris Cooper, Kelci Stephenson, Craig Archibald, Bronwen Coleman, Kate Shindle, David Wilson Barnes, Michael J.

966884,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000E33VWW,James Morris,"[14, 18]","Movie audiences have always loved movies about movies.  And even more so, movies about very popular movies.  Capote is a movie about the writing of a book that became a very popular movie.  The critics certainly loved Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the tortured novelist and the movie Capote; it's just a question of time before we know how popular this film turns out to be.  As far as I am concerned, Capote is the first major DVD release of 2006.In Cold Blood has long been considered one of the most realistic crime dramas ever filmed, and it's considered a high-point of 1960's cinema, mostly for it's documentary style.  In the film Capote, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote mentions that In Cold Blood represented a new type of literary accomplishment, a work based on fact presented in the style of narrative fiction.  Capote himself said that the book was meant to re-define non-fiction, and in fact, it did.  Many writers have since copied the style pioneered by Capote in the book In Cold Blood.The film tells the story of the writing of the book, and how it led to Capote's artistic downfall, despite its overwhelming success.  The film makes it clear that Capote was emotionally involved with one of the killers, but not enough to prevent himself from lying and manipulating the condemned and doomed men to get what he wanted.  The film also clearly details the cold emotionless manner in which Capote is able to divorce himself from his feelings and his conscience in order to develop his book, deceiving the killers into believing that their cooperation would somehow lead to their lives being spared, if not their actual exoneration.  In the process, Capote loses track of his own moral compass, yet was profoundly affected by his intense involvement with the two killers.  In order to gain their trust, Capote had to develop a friendship with the killers, and in fact, his friendship Perry Smith (played by Clifton Collins Jr.) borders on obsession.  We are never quite sure throughout the film exactly what is going on inside Capote's head; at times his interest in the killer's welfare appears quite genuine, at other points it appears that he is using them solely for the sake of getting a good book out of it.  Whatever his precise feelings, he suffered for his involvement - a post script to the film reminds us that In Cold Blood was the last piece of work that Capote ever finished.  Following the books completion, he began a downhill progression into alcohol addiction that he never overcame.  The film does not dwell on Capote's sexuality; although his male partner is included in several scenes, their relationship is never explored or physically represented, and his homosexuality is given a matter-of-fact but unobtrusive handling.Some of the scenes lifted from those in the original film In Cold Blood are done so well that, aside from the fact that the original was filmed in black and white, you can scarcely tell the difference.  The scene towards the end when the killers are finally executed so closely resembles the original film that you almost think it was lifted directly from it.On the whole, the film is dramatically satisfying and extremely entertaining.  Coupled with the extraordinary performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman, it emerges as a near perfect motion picture.",5,Gripping Portrait of Literary Creativity,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,3322,"['Movie', 'audiences', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'movies', 'movies', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'movies', 'very', 'popular', 'movies', 'Capote', 'movie', 'writing', 'book', 'became', 'very', 'popular', 'movie', 'critics', 'certainly', 'loved', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'tortured', 'novelist', 'movie', 'Capote', 'just', 'question', 'time', 'know', 'how', 'popular', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'As', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'Capote', 'first', 'major', 'DVD', 'release', '2006.In', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'long', 'been', 'considered', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'crime', 'dramas', 'ever', 'filmed', 'considered', 'high-point', '1960', 'cinema', 'mostly', 'documentary', 'style', 'film', 'Capote', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'mentions', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'represented', 'new', 'type', 'literary', 'accomplishment', 'work', 'based', 'fact', 'presented', 'style', 'narrative', 'fiction', 'Capote', 'said', 'book', 'was', 'meant', 're-define', 'non-fiction', 'fact', 'did', 'Many', 'writers', 'have', 'copied', 'style', 'pioneered', 'Capote', 'book', 'Cold', 'Blood.The', 'film', 'story', 'writing', 'book', 'how', 'led', 'Capote', 'artistic', 'downfall', 'overwhelming', 'success', 'film', 'clear', 'Capote', 'was', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'one', 'killers', 'not', 'enough', 'prevent', 'lying', 'manipulating', 'condemned', 'doomed', 'men', 'get', 'what', 'wanted', 'film', 'also', 'clearly', 'details', 'cold', 'emotionless', 'manner', 'Capote', 'able', 'divorce', 'feelings', 'conscience', 'order', 'develop', 'book', 'deceiving', 'killers', 'believing', 'cooperation', 'would', 'somehow', 'lead', 'lives', 'being', 'spared', 'not', 'actual', 'exoneration', 'process', 'Capote', 'track', 'own', 'moral', 'compass', 'was', 'profoundly', 'affected', 'intense', 'involvement', 'two', 'killers', 'order', 'gain', 'trust', 'Capote', 'had', 'develop', 'friendship', 'killers', 'fact', 'friendship', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'played', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'borders', 'obsession', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'Capote', 'head', 'times', 'interest', 'killer', 'welfare', 'quite', 'genuine', 'other', 'points', 'using', 'solely', 'sake', 'getting', 'good', 'book', 'Whatever', 'precise', 'feelings', 'suffered', 'involvement', 'post', 'script', 'film', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'was', 'last', 'piece', 'work', 'Capote', 'ever', 'finished', 'Following', 'books', 'completion', 'began', 'downhill', 'progression', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'never', 'overcame', 'film', 'not', 'dwell', 'Capote', 'sexuality', 'male', 'partner', 'included', 'several', 'scenes', 'relationship', 'never', 'explored', 'physically', 'represented', 'homosexuality', 'given', 'matter-of-fact', 'unobtrusive', 'handling.Some', 'scenes', 'lifted', 'original', 'film', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'aside', 'fact', 'original', 'was', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'can', 'scarcely', 'tell', 'difference', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'killers', 'are', 'finally', 'executed', 'so', 'closely', 'original', 'film', 'almost', 'think', 'was', 'lifted', 'directly', 'it.On', 'whole', 'film', 'dramatically', 'satisfying', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'Coupled', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'near', 'perfect', 'motion', 'picture']",N/A

Of the two films (the other being INFAMOUS, with Toby Jones), CAPOTE is the more self-consciously artistic: it has gorgeous cinematography by Adam Kimmel of the haunted and empty Kansas plains (Manitoba being used as that state's stand-in), and a truly unforgettable scene where Capote sneaks into a Holcomb funeral parlor and opens the casket of Mrs. Clutter, only to find her face (blown away by a shotgun) swathed in muslin like something mysterious and sacerdotal.The film is quite fine on its own terms, and has a superlative performance by Catherine Keener as the author Harper Lee, who accompanied her childhood friend Capote to Holcomb for his first long research trip and who listens with patience and forbearance to her friend's egotistical and insensitive rants. The film has a lovely sense of eerie slow pacing to it, and its focus is squarely on Capote's mercurial and conflicted character, and how his career was both made and ruined by the story, especially after he became emotionally entangled with one of the Clutters' killers, Perry Smith (an intense Clifton Collins, Jr.). Hoffman's portrayal of Capote was widely (and deservedly) praised, although he does emphasize the writer's cruelty and spoiled selfishness over his simultaneously capabilities for great charm and kindness. The filmmakers made a conscious choice to omit Capote's high life among Manhattan's cafe society, which is emphasized much more in INFAMOUS; the most grievous mistake of both films is to give any sense of life or humanity to the poor dead Clutters themselves, so that in neither film do we have enough of a sense of the monstrousness of their murders: one of the greatest achievements of IN COLD BLOOD itself is to make the Clutters almost unbearably human in the day leading up to their deaths.",4,Spoiled Monsters,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,2123,"['first', 'two', 'films', 'made', '2005', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'writing', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', 'CAPOTE', 'got', 'lion', 'share', 'critics', 'attention', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'eponymous', 'writer', 'who', 'found', 'story', 'would', 'make', 'rich', 'murder', 'Clutter', 'family', 'Holcomb', 'Kansas', '1959', 'two', 'films', 'other', 'being', 'INFAMOUS', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'CAPOTE', 'more', 'self-consciously', 'artistic', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'Adam', 'Kimmel', 'haunted', 'empty', 'Kansas', 'plains', 'Manitoba', 'being', 'used', 'state', 'stand-in', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'where', 'Capote', 'Holcomb', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'casket', 'Mrs.', 'Clutter', 'only', 'find', 'face', 'blown', 'away', 'shotgun', 'swathed', 'muslin', 'something', 'mysterious', 'sacerdotal.The', 'film', 'quite', 'fine', 'own', 'terms', 'superlative', 'performance', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'author', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'who', 'accompanied', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Capote', 'Holcomb', 'first', 'long', 'research', 'trip', 'who', 'patience', 'forbearance', 'friend', 'egotistical', 'insensitive', 'rants', 'film', 'lovely', 'sense', 'eerie', 'slow', 'pacing', 'focus', 'squarely', 'Capote', 'mercurial', 'conflicted', 'character', 'how', 'career', 'was', 'made', 'ruined', 'story', 'especially', 'became', 'emotionally', 'entangled', 'one', 'Clutters', 'killers', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'intense', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Hoffman', 'portrayal', 'Capote', 'was', 'widely', 'deservedly', 'praised', 'emphasize', 'writer', 'cruelty', 'spoiled', 'selfishness', 'simultaneously', 'capabilities', 'great', 'charm', 'kindness', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'conscious', 'choice', 'omit', 'Capote', 'high', 'life', 'Manhattan', 'cafe', 'society', 'emphasized', 'much', 'more', 'INFAMOUS', 'most', 'grievous', 'mistake', 'films', 'give', 'sense', 'life', 'humanity', 'poor', 'dead', 'Clutters', 'so', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'enough', 'sense', 'monstrousness', 'murders', 'one', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', 'make', 'Clutters', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'human', 'day', 'leading', 'up', 'deaths']",N/A

Pouliot,"[0, 0]","""Capote"" tells the story of the writing of the author's masterwork, ""In Cold Blood,"" which itself narrated the aftermath of the brutal shotgun murders of a Kansas family of four by two drifters in November 1959. Inexplicably drawn to newspaper stories about the murders, writer Truman Capote begins what will become a 4-year odyssey to write about the murders and maybe become/stay famous as a result. Using his reputation as a famous author, as well as his considerable personal charm, Capote works his way past accepted social boundaries. He brazenly walks into the funeral parlor to personally view the corpses of the deceased. Invited into the local sheriff's apartment (via a link to the sheriff's wife, who is also a writer) he manages to make contact with one of the killers, imprisoned (weirdly) in a cell built into the kitchen. By fair means and foul, Capote lies, charms and ingratiates his way into obtaining the material he needs for his book -- all except for the crucial details of what happened on the night of the murders. His continued efforts to keep everyone feeding him sensitive and even damaging information -- while simultaneously reaping the benefits of public adulation -- is creepy in the extreme.Yet Capote is affected by his contact with the townsfolk and with the prisoners. He is tortured by the legal continuances that prevent him from getting closure. His desire to end the book becomes a means in itself, though it means the death of people he has come to care about.""Capote"" teaches a bit about the author's life, but much about his soul. If the film is true to life, Capote was transformed from a man-about-town into a caring human being who was all but destroyed by the experience of writing his book. Given Capote's insouciant reputation in later years, this was one part of the film did not ring true.Still, Philip Seymour Hoffman did a very fine job portraying the author's talent, intelligence, single-mindedness...and duplicity. If anything, his portrayal was rather restrained, given Capote's extravagant persona. Catherine Keener's portrayal of Capote's friend, author Harper Lee, was solid and grounded the movie in reality and a modicum of period social morality. Clifton Collins, Jr. gave a phenomenal performance as erudite, sensitive killer Perry Smith. The film was ensemble work of the highest caliber. I do wish the filmmakers had been bolder about placing Capote in relation to the morality of the late 1950s, which were notoriously less tolerant of rule-benders like Capote than we are today. Had the film been a bit less restrained, it might have been a shoo-in for the ""Best Movie"" Oscar.As it is, though, the movie tells a chilling and compelling tale of the writing of one of the 20th century's ground-breaking books. The movie's success can be measured in my visceral lack of interest in reading ""In Cold Blood"" in the foreseeable future!",4,In Cold Ink,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,2897,"['Capote', 'story', 'writing', 'author', 'masterwork', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'narrated', 'aftermath', 'brutal', 'shotgun', 'murders', 'Kansas', 'family', 'four', 'two', 'drifters', 'November', '1959', 'Inexplicably', 'drawn', 'newspaper', 'stories', 'murders', 'writer', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'what', 'will', 'become', '4-year', 'odyssey', 'write', 'murders', 'maybe', 'become/stay', 'famous', 'result', 'Using', 'reputation', 'famous', 'author', 'as', 'well', 'considerable', 'personal', 'charm', 'Capote', 'way', 'accepted', 'social', 'boundaries', 'brazenly', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'personally', 'view', 'corpses', 'deceased', 'Invited', 'local', 'sheriff', 'apartment', 'link', 'sheriff', 'wife', 'who', 'also', 'writer', 'make', 'contact', 'one', 'killers', 'imprisoned', 'weirdly', 'cell', 'built', 'kitchen', 'fair', 'means', 'foul', 'Capote', 'charms', 'way', 'obtaining', 'material', 'book', 'crucial', 'details', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'murders', 'continued', 'efforts', 'keep', 'everyone', 'feeding', 'sensitive', 'even', 'damaging', 'information', 'simultaneously', 'reaping', 'benefits', 'public', 'adulation', 'creepy', 'extreme.Yet', 'Capote', 'affected', 'contact', 'townsfolk', 'prisoners', 'tortured', 'legal', 'continuances', 'prevent', 'getting', 'closure', 'desire', 'end', 'book', 'means', 'death', 'people', 'come', 'care', 'about', 'Capote', 'bit', 'author', 'life', 'much', 'soul', 'film', 'true', 'life', 'Capote', 'was', 'transformed', 'man-about-town', 'caring', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'was', 'destroyed', 'experience', 'writing', 'book', 'Given', 'Capote', 'insouciant', 'reputation', 'later', 'years', 'was', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'ring', 'true.Still', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'did', 'very', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'author', 'talent', 'intelligence', 'single-mindedness', 'duplicity', 'anything', 'portrayal', 'was', 'rather', 'restrained', 'given', 'Capote', 'extravagant', 'persona', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'portrayal', 'Capote', 'friend', 'author', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'was', 'solid', 'grounded', 'movie', 'reality', 'modicum', 'period', 'social', 'morality', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'gave', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'erudite', 'sensitive', 'killer', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'film', 'was', 'ensemble', 'work', 'highest', 'caliber', 'do', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'been', 'bolder', 'placing', 'Capote', 'relation', 'morality', 'late', '1950s', 'were', 'notoriously', 'less', 'tolerant', 'rule-benders', 'Capote', 'are', 'today', 'Had', 'film', 'been', 'bit', 'less', 'restrained', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'shoo-in', 'Best', 'Movie', 'though', 'movie', 'chilling', 'compelling', 'tale', 'writing', 'one', '20th', 'century', 'ground-breaking', 'books', 'movie', 'success', 'can', 'be', 'measured', 'visceral', 'lack', 'interest', 'reading', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'foreseeable', 'future']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[0, 0]","Two very engaging and very compelling things are centerpieces for works that people keep coming back to again and again: psychopaths and artists. Especially when both are slightly insane or egotistic, the analysis of brains abnormal and uncomprehending are fascinating and wondrous motifs that re-occur in literature and media again and again.This movie has both, a very contradictory and egotistic mind, Truman Capote's, matched with the alarmingly sweet and charismatic mind of a psychopath, Perry Smith, who Truman falls in love with and interviews for research to write his best-selling and important work, In Cold Blood. The result is very affecting. Hoffman's zealous and defined portrayal of Capote is matched by the outstanding performance of Clifton Collin's Jr., the lonely and slightly terrifying face of a killer who is human and humanized.The real drama comes from Capote's terrifyingly manipulative mind. For someone who didn't know much about Capote, Hoffman's performance was simply shocking. The commercials and advertising and posters and the like would have you imagine that Capote was a very strong artistic trope, like other biopics that show brilliant artists and their troubles. However, a couple of things should be noted... first, this is not a biopic. Second, Capote's flamboyantly homosexual and confrontational controversial mannerisms both set the man himself apart from the type of character we like to see from artists, and also set Hoffman's performance apart from basically anything we've ever seen before.A side-result is a very discomforting and contradictory look. Capote lies, manipulates, cheats... and yet the presentation of these events help us concern ourselves with his character so much that we can't help but want every part of his innermost desires to actualize. We have a man who kills, but he's also lonely and afraid and willing to cling on to anybody who will give him attention. We empathize with characters we'd normally shun, yet simultaneously feel uncomfortable being so close to them, thus wanting to know more about them so that we can come to terms with who they are.And at the end, when we see the denouement of what is both a perverse and a relatable relationship, the movie centers in on Smith's heavy breathing as he awaits his doom and the audience breaths heavily along with him, feeling all hope begin to fade from the screen as the deranged Capote watches on.

Films have to be judged critically.In this case, Bennett Miller's ""Capote"" deserved every ounce of praise it garnered, mostly due to Hoffmann's unbelievable performance as Truman Streckfus Persons, a.k.a Truman Capote.  Capote's magnum opus ""In Cold Blood"" transformed the True Crime genre from a ""a 10 cent novel"" status to an actual genre, for better or worse, with its mercilessly objective and strangely artful tale of a brutal murder in a sleepy town in Holcomb, Kansas.  It also drew a lot of both wanted and unwanted (both were devoured by the author) attention to Capote as a public figure, many accusing him of beatifying Perry Smith and his partner in crime Richard Hicock.Philip Seymour Hoffmann's portrayal of Capote is indeed a once in a lifetime performance.  An undoubtedly difficult character to bring to the screen in all his vividness and petty ambition, Hoffmann rose to the challenge.  In every frame you see this charismatic opportunist and maybe 40 percent decent person use every angle he can to obtain what he really wants; intimate, uninterrupted conversations with Perry Smith (played by Clifton Collins, Jr. who has been one of my favorite deviants since his turn as ""Caezar"" in the underrated film ""187"" with Samuel L. Jackson) and access to everything about the case.The point of the movie is pretty clear and bares a fair resemblance to reality.  Capote was letting his emotions (for smith) drown him.  His actual intent was to extract what he could as an artist and make the cultural significance of the incident--two misfits committing mass mayhem in 1950's America without reason or cause--open up new ways of thinking to the reader.  Now, though, his innate selfishness and ambition were turning on him, as he had a feeling or two for the actual people involved and their lives.  As a result, he suffers greatly, and probably justly.I think this movie will stay in the lexicon of great film for some time.

He got Smith to confide in him at first by getting him an appellate lawyer who gave Smith some temporary relief through the appellate process.As Smith faced the death penalty and exhausted his appeals, the movie suggests that Capote deliberately refused to help Smith out beyond that first effort. It leaves the viewer wondering whether he may have had the chance to do so. If the movie accurately portrays Capote, it was Capote's realization that he cared more about his book than about his ""friend"" that tore his mind apart.As Capote himself said: ""answered prayers cause more tears than those that remain unanswered"".In the end, Capote got what he prayed for, but he also never wrote another book. The movie suggests he asked himself the question: ""If I hadn't been so selfish, could I have saved Smith's life?",5,Great depiction of a tormented mind,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,1077,"['Cold', 'Blood', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'became', 'America', 'most', 'famous', 'writer', 'movie', 'Capote', 'sold', 'soul', 'order', 'produce', 'book.The', 'book', 'cold', 'blooded', 'murders', 'family', 'Kansas', 'Capote', 'befriended', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'one', 'killers', 'got', 'Smith', 'confide', 'first', 'getting', 'appellate', 'lawyer', 'who', 'gave', 'Smith', 'temporary', 'relief', 'appellate', 'process.As', 'Smith', 'faced', 'death', 'penalty', 'exhausted', 'appeals', 'movie', 'Capote', 'deliberately', 'refused', 'help', 'Smith', 'out', 'first', 'effort', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'do', 'so', 'movie', 'accurately', 'portrays', 'Capote', 'was', 'Capote', 'realization', 'cared', 'more', 'book', 'friend', 'tore', 'mind', 'apart.As', 'Capote', 'said', 'answered', 'prayers', 'cause', 'more', 'tears', 'remain', 'unanswered', 'end', 'Capote', 'got', 'what', 'prayed', 'also', 'never', 'wrote', 'book', 'movie', 'asked', 'question', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'selfish', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'Smith', 'life']",N/A

966902,AOKKY21CAQVGM,B000E33VWW,Jim&Yvonne,"[0, 2]","Wow is all that I can say.  Philip Seymour Hoffman was just amazing and very deserving of his Oscar win for best actor in Capote.  His portrayal of Truman Capote during his writing of the non-fiction novel of ""In Cold Blood"" was just amazing.  This movie is not a typical Hollywood film, no CGI, no special effects, etc., some blood splattering, which was minimal, to illustrate the crime of which Capote's novel was based upon, no chases, no nothing, except a brilliant performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Catherine Keener.  What is amazing is the range to these two actors, they both can do comedy, both can do action and both can do a serious dialog driven film-What range and what perfect people to play these two famous people as Keener played the understudy, friend of Capote who had her own career with ""To Kill a Mocking Bird.""  I have seen all best pictures nominated except for Brokeback Mountain, therefore, I can not give an opinion of my choice for best picture.  However, when doing a prior review, I thought Munich was much better than Crash (which won), which would mean that it was better than all other best movie nominees that I have seen.  However, after seeing Capote, the screenplay, the adaptation, the actors, the subject matter, the editing as well as the filming of the movie would make me think that this is the movie to see-However, again, I haven't seen Brokeback Mountain, so I will reserve my choice until later.  The director, little known, first feature film will of course not get a nod because there were higher profile directors with Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain) and Steven Spielberg (Munich), etc.,.  However, for those who want to see a wonderful, eccentric performance, one that mimics the life and times of one of America's best authors, you have to see this.  Philip Seymour Hoffman had it down-He nailed it.  He nailed Capote feminism, quirkiness, manipulation, glib, self absorbing, his need to be the center of attention among his metamorphous to being a caring, loving person of life, not necessarily of the two murderers that his novel is based upon, but his love of life for all.  Capote (or Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a master storyteller with his mentioning of one of the deaths that the pillow was placed under the victim perfectly and the victim was shot with a shotgun, like being put to sleep.  There is a lot of information available on Capote, but to narrow it down to the period after ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" to the period of the film, I believe three or four years of his life during his research for ""In Cold Blood"" was amazingly done.  The movie left you leaving did Capote use these people (the murderers) to make his novel or did he treasure life so much that he thought that these murderers should not die?  I don't know what his motive was, but I do know, as Capote and his publisher indicated that this novel was the start of a new way that authors write books.  Capote said that ""When I think how good this novel can be, I can't breath."" makes me feel his motive was his book.

By the time I was old enough to be aware of who Truman Capote was, he was an object of scorn and ridicule by the popular press and had alienated most of his socialite friends because of Answered Prayers.So for a long time, it was a mystery to me how this broken, alcoholic could once have been so celebrated.There are many layers and nuances in this film but the classic tragedy is what has stayed with me the longest. Truman Capote makes the essential Faustian bargain: he receives the fame and praise he so desperately seeks by lying and manipulating but once he gets what he wants: a book that sets new conventions for True Crime stories, he can't live with himself.This is so beautifully played out in the movie's climax when Capote visits the two men immediately prior to their executions. He tries to say something and can only manage choked sobs. It is Perry, the man about to be hung, that consoles Capote.Another point raised during the film is that Truman Capote was not without people who genuinely loved and cared about him. In particular, his lover, Jack Dunphy and his childhood friend, Harper Lee. But it isn't enough and by running after what he wanted but didn't need, Capote essentially anniliates himself.In our celebrity-obsessed culture, this film quietly and truthfully paints a picture of the price many pay for seeking the illusion.",5,Pure Tragedy,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,1448,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'only', 'few', 'short', 'stories', 'excerpts', 'Answered', 'Prayers', 'time', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'aware', 'who', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'was', 'was', 'object', 'scorn', 'ridicule', 'popular', 'press', 'had', 'alienated', 'most', 'socialite', 'friends', 'Answered', 'Prayers.So', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'mystery', 'how', 'broken', 'alcoholic', 'could', 'once', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'celebrated.There', 'are', 'many', 'layers', 'nuances', 'film', 'classic', 'tragedy', 'what', 'stayed', 'longest', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'essential', 'Faustian', 'bargain', 'fame', 'praise', 'so', 'desperately', 'seeks', 'lying', 'manipulating', 'once', 'what', 'book', 'new', 'conventions', 'True', 'Crime', 'stories', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'himself.This', 'so', 'beautifully', 'played', 'out', 'movie', 'climax', 'when', 'Capote', 'two', 'men', 'immediately', 'prior', 'executions', 'say', 'something', 'can', 'only', 'manage', 'choked', 'sobs', 'Perry', 'man', 'be', 'hung', 'Capote.Another', 'point', 'raised', 'film', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'was', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'genuinely', 'loved', 'cared', 'particular', 'lover', 'Jack', 'Dunphy', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Harper', 'Lee', ""n't"", 'enough', 'running', 'what', 'wanted', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'Capote', 'essentially', 'himself.In', 'celebrity-obsessed', 'culture', 'film', 'quietly', 'truthfully', 'picture', 'price', 'many', 'pay', 'seeking', 'illusion']",N/A

The ""buzz"" it generated was well-deserved due to its writing, acting and cinematography.Especially underestimated is the impact of the last item.  Since the writing is so good, and since it's about writing, the production values are easy to underestimate or overlook.  Great care went into set decoration, period costume and such.  However, the usage of color was agreed before the first shot was taken.  Unbelievably, they decided not to use any blues or reds, and the result is an unrelentingly bleak look.  It was shot in and around Winnepeg, as a proxy for late-50s Kansas.  The result was just as intended.  Wheat and flat and snow and a terrible sweep of the soul.Truman's essential vulnerability is sacrificed in pursuit of ""a whole new kind of writing.""  The end result, arguably, is the sort of heartless exploitative journalism that predominates writing today.Others here say that it also destroyed Capote.  I disagree.  They way this movie depicts him, Capote was already destroyed.  It starts when he pays a railway porter to tell him how great his writing is, right at the beginning of the film.

After years on Death Row and multiple appeals, they were hung by the neck until dead on April 14, 1965. Truman Capote's book based on the crime, IN COLD BLOOD, was published in 1966.CAPOTE is the cinematic depiction of Truman's 4-year obsession with the case, and his growing emotional attachment to Smith, as he researched material for IN COLD BLOOD. The author is played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Smith by Clifton Collins, and Hickock by Mark Pellegrino.Hoffman's Capote is 5 stars and worthy of an Oscar nomination. I would be satisfied if he wins, regardless of the others nominated for Best Actor in pictures that may not even have been released yet, because his performance as the brilliant, tormented, self-affected, and pathetic writer is that excellent. That being said, however, the film is a joyless and tedious character study that is one of the most boring films I've seen recently; my wife had to jab my side to keep me eyelids-up. The only highpoints for me were the achingly beautiful, but all too infrequent, wide-angle shots of the ""Kansas"" landscape (actually filmed in Manitoba), and the visual jolt when, towards the film's end, Smith reveals to Capote what actually happened in the Clutter farmhouse.CAPOTE is a must-see movie for any admirer of Truman and his writings, but it just wasn't for me.",3,One man's obsession is another man's soporific,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,1576,"['Have', 'ever', 'read', 'heard', 'instance', 'woman', 'falling', 'love', 'jailed', 'murderer', 'thought', 'How', 'pathetic', 'November', '14', '1959', 'Kansas', 'four', 'members', 'Clutter', 'family', 'were', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Richard', 'Hickock', 'years', 'Death', 'Row', 'multiple', 'appeals', 'were', 'hung', 'neck', 'dead', 'April', '14', '1965', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'book', 'based', 'crime', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', 'was', 'published', '1966.CAPOTE', 'cinematic', 'depiction', 'Truman', '4-year', 'obsession', 'case', 'growing', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'Smith', 'researched', 'material', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', 'author', 'played', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Smith', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Hickock', 'Mark', 'Pellegrino.Hoffman', 'Capote', '5', 'stars', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'would', 'be', 'satisfied', 'regardless', 'others', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'pictures', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'yet', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'tormented', 'self-affected', 'pathetic', 'writer', 'excellent', 'being', 'said', 'however', 'film', 'joyless', 'tedious', 'character', 'study', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'wife', 'had', 'jab', 'side', 'keep', 'eyelids-up', 'only', 'highpoints', 'were', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'too', 'infrequent', 'wide-angle', 'shots', 'Kansas', 'landscape', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Manitoba', 'visual', 'jolt', 'when', 'film', 'end', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'Clutter', 'farmhouse.CAPOTE', 'must-see', 'movie', 'admirer', 'Truman', 'writings', 'just', 'was', ""n't""]",N/A
966913,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000E33VWW,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","The first time I saw ""Capote"" (the day it was released on DVD), I appreciated it for Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance and it's atmosphere. That's about it. I gave it a good grade and moved on, looking at the movie as a disappointment when it caught my eye at a video store. I usually agree with a lot of famous film critic's selections on their yearly Top 10 lists. I don't always agree with the order of the list, but I usually agree that they're great films. So when I didn't like Capote, I was surprised. I hadn't really considered watching it again, until I saw the movie at my local library. It was free and I had nothing else to watch and watching it now I appreciate it a lot more...And enjoyed it a lot more. This movie does not achieve greatness merely from a great performance or a great atmosphere. Those two things help it to achieve its brilliance, but there's a lot more I missed in my first viewing. First of all, I want to talk about Hoffman's Oscar winning performance. Yes he won the Oscar, beating out three other actors who played real life people, but people still say that he didn't deserve it. People have said his performance was mimicry, while someone like Joaquin Phoenix managed to really show the shaded areas of the person they were playing. This is an unfair statement. If you weren't doing some form of mimicry while playing Truman Capote, you'd have no film. In playing someone like Johnny Cash, you don't need to sound like him. In playing Truman Capote, mastering his speech and his mannerisms is essential. The movie has an Oscar nominated script by actor Dan Futterman, who has (like most other screen-biographers) opted out of a childhood-to-death biopic...Instead Futterman chronicles what could be classified as the most important time in Truman Capote's life. It's 1959 and in a small Kansas town called Halcomb, a family of four is brutally murdered. This sends the town into frenzy and gives novelist/screenwriter Truman Capote an idea for a newspaper article. He travels to Kansas with his friend, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" novelist Nelle ""Harper"" Lee (Catherine Keener, in an Oscar worthy, and nominated, performance), and begins research. Soon, the killers are caught and Capote finds himself surprised. Men, whom he thought at first would be hardened violent criminals are two dim-witted men named Perry Smith and Dick Hickock (Clifton Collins Jr. & Mark Pellegrino). Capote soon finds that he's not writing a newspaper article at all, but a novel...A non-fiction novel, the first of its kind. He begins interviewing Smith and Hickok, but finds a connection with Smith...A man Capote basically befriends, all the while using him for his own exploits. The movie does a great job of showing the different shades of Truman Capote. The outspoken, talkative cartoonish-voiced man who would bring life to various parties. A sweet man, whom people loved to talk too. A dedicated, smart novelist with a fantastic memory. A man hell-bent on writing a great novel, despite the fact a friend has to die for him to complete it. The scenes between Capote and Smith are truly heartbreaking. In fact, it almost seems (at times) that Capote is more of a bad guy than Smith is. Chris Cooper also turns in a strong performance as the head of the murder investigation, Alvin Dewey. ""Capote"" was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture...The only Oscar went to Best Actor for Hoffman, but the film could've easily taken Cinematography and Art Direction trophies. The movie has a stark, gray atmosphere to it. This helps remind the audience of how depressing the movie truly is. I don't believe there's one shot (except for a scene in Spain) where there's sunlight. One of the strongest performances in the film belongs to Collins Jr. as Smith. Collins is an actor I haven't seen in any movies previously, but he plays Smith very convincingly. In the scene where Smith finally opens up to Capote about the murders, the look he gets in his eyes and the way the cadence of his voice changes shows that this guy could become a legend in the years to come. While I admit that this isn't the most entertaining film in the world (I found myself looking at the clock a few times), it was one of the best films of 2005 and it is very engrossing. One other thing I want to add. There's some great scenes (that many could claim are out of place) where Capote will talk about various exploits. One, which I found amusing, was about the writing process of a John Huston film called ""Beat the Devil."" While he doesn't actually say the title, so most people won't notice...He talks about the director and the star of the film, Humphrey Bogart. If you know what movie he is talking about and know about Bogart, this story is particularly amusing. One of the things that works best about a scene like that is you realize that if you were at a party with Capote and he was talking about something that you knew about, he would really hold your attention. Great acting, a solid script, great directing, awesome cinematography, a wonderful atmosphere, although does grow a bit dull at times...This is a movie you won't want to miss.GRADE:

He travels to Kansas with his friend Harper Lee (author of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"") and witnesses the arrest, trial, and imprisonment of the two men responsible for the murders.  At first Capote plans to write a short story about the killings, but as he digs further into the circumstances, he realizes that it has the makings of a great novel.

Ultimately, however, Capote becomes anxious to finish the book and this can only happen after the men are executed.  Capote treads a fine line of friendship vs. his own convenience and the viewer sees his moral fiber quickly erode.

966924,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000E33VWW,Kaya Savas,"[2, 3]","MOVIE: The film's opening scene is Truman Capote at a party, and he is standing with a drink in his hand while telling a story. Everyone standing around him is laughing and he is there almost performing a show for them. Here is where we have a first glimpse of the eccentric character of Truman Capote. Capote (pronounced 'cah-poh-tee') is brilliant film that takes an inside look at two different men. Here we have Truman Capote (Phillip Seymore Hoffman) who is a man who is absolutly full of himself. He loves to hear himself talk, and he loves it when people compliment his writing. Why shouldn't he love it, his work is incredibly brilliant. He is searchinh for the topic of his next article, and he picks a murder that happened in rural Kansas. Four people were murdered when two men broke and entered their homes. Truman travels by train to the small town along with Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) to interview people who were assosiated with the murder. The two brothers accused of the murders are put to death, and Truman befriends one of them. He visits him in his cell and talks with him about who he is as a person. Capote decides that he wants to write a book instead of an article when he sees how interesting his subject is. They share stories about their pasts and how both of them seem to be outcasts of society. However, this is where the murderer, Perry Smith, actually finds a friend in Truman. Truman on the other hand is only after information that will make is book a masterpiece. As time goes by Truman starts to find decency within this man, and actually tries to fight for him so that his death sentence is appealed. After three years Truman's book is almost finished, but he still has no idea why the murders happened. When he finally probes the information out of Perry a whole new side of this man is revealed. The film is psychologically haunting. We have Truman Capote, a very eccentric yet brilliant homosexual writer. We also have Perry Smith, the murderer who seems to be a decent person and claims that they never meant to kill that family. The film digs deep on Truman's character, and just enough for Perry's. When the end comes and we learn the truth about the murders, we see a change in both characters. The film also boasts some very subtle yet amazing cinematography. Almost every shot is framed through a window or a doorway. In the jail we have some shots framed through the bars. The film also has some amazing lighting, and the lighting on the faces is another subtlety to notice. The haunting score by Mychael Danna is amazing. The score is nothing more than simple notes on the piano, very similar to Newman's score for Road To Perdition. The film is a deep and dark look into the human mind, and human emotion. I have read some reviews that suggest that there may have been a sexual attraction between Capote and Smith, but I did not see that at all. I felt it was just an interest in a person who is deemed a monster yet is a very poignant person. The film was brilliant and haunting, and is worth your while.ACTING: Phillip Seymore Hoffman gives a tour de force performance of Truman Capote. Not only did he capture the pompous nature of the writer, but he captured the emotion within him as a human being. Clifton Collins Jr. gives an amazing performance as the very ambiguous Perry Smith. The two actors also play off each other very well, their acting envelopes the audience into the atmosphere of the film and makes their conversations all the more emotional. Both actors are worthy of nominations, and Hoffman may have given a performance that translates into Oscar.BOTTOM LINE: While some people may find the first quarter of the film slow, it picks up and ends up being one of those movies that stays with you long after you see it. The performances are stellar, and they add to the film's effect on the audience. Bennet Miller's direction is on the mark as he spends the right amount of time with each character, and he sets up the third act of the film perfectly",5,"A Brilliant Film, Rich With Character & Emotion.

966929,A27KNXAROMSJ7A,B000E33VWW,"Kelly L. Norman ""li'l rock & roller""","[0, 0]","This is a good movie.  It's an incredible first effort for director Bennett Miller.  And it's a stellar (not a Hollywood-star stellar, but brilliant stellar) introduction to one of the most intriguing 20th century English-speaking literary figures this side of Oscar Wilde. An introduction that leaves a body wanting to know more about this ascerbic wit, who once threw the world's most talked-about party (the Black and White affair in 1968), but could not bring himself to write a productive word after the  events chronicled in this film, between 1959 and 1965.  All I knew about Capote before seeing this film was that he wrote ""In Cold Blood"" (which I read only in anticipation of watching this film), that he had a high-pitched, nasally voice, that he showed up on late-night TV shows a lot when I was a kid, and I've wondered since if he was gay.  But I had no desire or inclination to learn anything else about him, or suspect that he had any real influence on American literature as a whole.Now that I've seen the film (and know that my gay-dar is relatively effective)I do have a hunger to read more of his works, especially those done initially for the New Yorker, such as his coverage of an African American opera company tour of the Soviet Union in 1956 (during which he apparently gave the hosts, not the artists, scathing reviews, much to Moscow's dismay).The cinematography, acting, and sparse score of ""Capote""indicate immediately that this film will be different:  gray cumulus clouds hang pregnant over a Kansas field where a lone '56 Buick sits at a silent farmhouse.  There is a breeze, but there is no music to tell you what to expect.  A little girl is on the doorstop knocking (not ringing a bell), then walking in the house to discover the evidence that will start ""In Cold Blood"". Jump cut immediately to the New York skyline where we do hear music, but it's music from a party, not a movie score, where Truman Is Holding Court, sitting  while others stand enraptured by one of his anecdotes, at which, of course, they all laugh.  Seymour and everyone here is very natural, very fresh, very comfortable with each other (or, like in the case with the sherriff of Holcomb, very comfortable being uncomfortable with Seymour's character).And there is certainly some tension in Capote's relationship with both perpetrators, Dick and Perry.  Even though he feels he can win Perry over, Perry senses this, and there is a genuine back and forth with the characters in the film.In summary, the acting is great, the cinematography is great, the development of most of the main characters, namely Truman, his friend Nelle (Harper Lee), and Perry Smith, is fairly good.There is something missing in the story, however.  Within the tension of the problem that Capote has set for himself (to want Perry to love him enough to share everything with him, but to want Perry to die so that the book can be over with), he and his friends can recognize his dilemma.  And his friends chide him for it.Nowhere, however, does anyone scold him for his betrayal of the Clutters or those who loved them.What is evident is Capote's disgust when Perry tells him coolly, ""Mr Cutter was a nice gentleman...I thought so right up to the moment that I cut his throat."" But this sign that maybe he is remembering the victims of the crime seems undone by his lover's and friend's insistence that he's being selfish to avoid helping or seeing the accused killlers further.I would have liked a more evident struggle with this issue.  For instance, surely some of the people Capote interviewed and sympathized with about the murders must have known he had gone to Lansing and Leavenworth to visit with the prisoners.  Did they contact him about that?  What did they say?In the meantime, I will look forward to both Mr. Miller and Mr. Seymour's next efforts.  And ""The Capote Reader"" (which includes that story of the 1956 USSR tour) now adorns my wishlist, in case anyone is in a giving mood.",4,"""I thought [he was nice] right up to the moment that I cut his throat.",1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,3979,"['good', 'movie', 'incredible', 'first', 'effort', 'director', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'stellar', 'not', 'Hollywood-star', 'stellar', 'brilliant', 'stellar', 'introduction', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', '20th', 'century', 'English-speaking', 'literary', 'figures', 'side', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'introduction', 'body', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'ascerbic', 'wit', 'who', 'once', 'threw', 'world', 'most', 'talked-about', 'party', 'Black', 'White', 'affair', '1968', 'could', 'not', 'bring', 'write', 'productive', 'word', 'events', 'chronicled', 'film', '1959', '1965', 'knew', 'Capote', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'wrote', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'read', 'only', 'anticipation', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'high-pitched', 'nasally', 'voice', 'showed', 'up', 'late-night', 'TV', 'lot', 'when', 'was', 'kid', ""'ve"", 'wondered', 'was', 'gay', 'had', 'desire', 'inclination', 'learn', 'anything', 'else', 'suspect', 'had', 'real', 'influence', 'American', 'literature', 'whole.Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'know', 'gay-dar', 'relatively', 'effective', 'do', 'have', 'hunger', 'read', 'more', 'works', 'especially', 'done', 'initially', 'New', 'Yorker', 'such', 'coverage', 'African', 'American', 'opera', 'company', 'tour', 'Soviet', 'Union', '1956', 'apparently', 'gave', 'hosts', 'not', 'artists', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'much', 'Moscow', 'dismay', '.The', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'sparse', 'score', 'Capote', 'indicate', 'immediately', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'gray', 'cumulus', 'clouds', 'hang', 'pregnant', 'Kansas', 'field', 'where', 'lone', 'Buick', 'sits', 'silent', 'farmhouse', 'breeze', 'music', 'tell', 'what', 'expect', 'little', 'girl', 'doorstop', 'knocking', 'not', 'ringing', 'bell', 'then', 'walking', 'house', 'discover', 'evidence', 'will', 'start', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'Jump', 'cut', 'immediately', 'New', 'York', 'skyline', 'where', 'do', 'hear', 'music', 'music', 'party', 'not', 'movie', 'score', 'where', 'Truman', 'Holding', 'Court', 'sitting', 'others', 'stand', 'enraptured', 'one', 'anecdotes', 'course', 'laugh', 'Seymour', 'everyone', 'here', 'very', 'natural', 'very', 'fresh', 'very', 'comfortable', 'other', 'case', 'sherriff', 'Holcomb', 'very', 'comfortable', 'being', 'uncomfortable', 'Seymour', 'character', '.And', 'certainly', 'tension', 'Capote', 'relationship', 'perpetrators', 'Dick', 'Perry', 'Even', 'can', 'win', 'Perry', 'Perry', 'genuine', 'back', 'forth', 'characters', 'film.In', 'summary', 'acting', 'great', 'cinematography', 'great', 'development', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'namely', 'Truman', 'friend', 'Nelle', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'fairly', 'something', 'missing', 'story', 'however', 'tension', 'problem', 'Capote', 'set', 'want', 'Perry', 'love', 'enough', 'share', 'everything', 'want', 'Perry', 'die', 'so', 'book', 'can', 'be', 'friends', 'can', 'recognize', 'dilemma', 'friends', 'chide', 'it.Nowhere', 'however', 'anyone', 'scold', 'betrayal', 'Clutters', 'who', 'loved', 'them.What', 'evident', 'Capote', 'disgust', 'when', 'Perry', 'coolly', 'Mr', 'Cutter', 'was', 'nice', 'gentleman', 'thought', 'so', 'right', 'moment', 'cut', 'throat', 'sign', 'maybe', 'remembering', 'victims', 'crime', 'undone', 'lover', 'friend', 'insistence', 'being', 'selfish', 'avoid', 'helping', 'seeing', 'accused', 'killlers', 'further.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'evident', 'struggle', 'issue', 'instance', 'surely', 'people', 'Capote', 'interviewed', 'sympathized', 'murders', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'had', 'gone', 'Lansing', 'Leavenworth', 'visit', 'prisoners', 'Did', 'contact', 'What', 'did', 'say', 'meantime', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'Mr.', 'Miller', 'Mr.', 'Seymour', 'next', 'efforts', 'Capote', 'Reader', 'story', '1956', 'USSR', 'tour', 'now', 'wishlist', 'case', 'anyone', 'giving', 'mood']",N/A

He is joined by his assistant and best friend, Nelle Harper Lee, who later wrote *To Kill a Mockingbird*.Perry Smith and Richard Hickock were soon captured in Las Vegas and brought back to Holcome to answer for the murders.  Capote befriends them both to write his article.  However, Capote develops some chemistry with Smith and decides to write a book instead.This goal to write a book causes a strain on Capote's relationship with his lover, who was also a writer.  Anyways, the relationship between Capote and Smith is interesting.  Capote needs Smith to retell the night of the murder.  Instead, Smith talks about everything else.  In retaliation, Capote withholds information whenver Smith inquires about the book.It takes Capote four years to write this book.  Initially, Capote is excited about this prospect.  However, as time goes by, he becomes depressed, especially when Smith and Hickock lose their appeal, with the Supreme Court, from execution.  He's so depressed that can't even put aside his feelings and offer congratulations to Lee on her new novel.When all is done, Capote manages to complete his book, *In Cold Blood*.  He never wrote another book afterwards.Philip Seymour Hoffman did a good job as Capote.  I liked him the moment I first saw him in *Talented Mr. Ripley*.  He has never disappointed me since.

After reading about this film for months and seeing Philip Seymour walk away with the statuette at the Oscars, I had high hopes for a drama built around real events. Turns out the dramatic part occurred, but without satisfaction for the high hopes.Among other things, this film is essentially a 110-minute whisper over one of the most startling real life events in the last half of the 20th century. Not only did the Nebraska murders teach the Midwest to lock their doors at night, it ushered in a new form of literature with the nonfiction novel. This had previously been introduced via Norman Mailer's work centering on World War II and Capote finished it off in the same way Alexander Graham Bell perfected the telephone that was invented by someone else.The history portrayed in the film was useful insofar as I had no idea Capote was also author of both ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" in novel and film treatment forms. I was also surprised to learn, through my own research while watching the movie, that Capote did not author another tome of much popular value outside it and ""In Cold Blood"".While Hoffman probably earned his award for this film, I recall the real Truman Capote and Hoffman ain't it. He is more a caricature of the real man, who was perhaps the ugliest man that ever lived in the United States. Hoffman not only presented a Richard Gere caricature of Capote, with his beautiful facial lines set against the real life Capote's egg-shaped head, his elegance and eloquence were more a match for a character at Tiffany's than for the real flesh and blood man.No matter, I suppose, for now this is a done deal and most people accepted it as the best characterization to date. Still, that characterization is rarely enough to carry the heavy weight of this film, which is bolstered by fine support from the likes of Chris Cooper. The wieight I refer to is the feature moving at a glacial pace in darkened scenes that mimic film noir.While perhaps captivating on the big screen in the mall, the molasses in February pace caused me jitters and unease watching at home. In addtion, the overriding darkness is metaphor to the ugliness of the story, no doubt, but still works against the film as entertainment. While leaving no doubt this is important stuff, it nonetheless comes off as more an exercise in doggedness than anything equivalent to fun.In prior films of the nature, including Cliff Robertson's Oscar-winning characterization as ""Charly"" and Al Pacino's prize as the blind tough guy in ""Scent of A Woman"" -- terrific portrayals inside similarly mediocre films -- the producers added life to the bland stories and critics didn't offer undeserved awards to the slow-moving beast of a movie.

The film constructs, with not one extraneous scene or unnecessary bit of dialog, an understanding of his place in literary society, and his chameleon-like ease at blending into the lives of the people whom he wanted to capture and luring them into trusting him with their lives and stories. His ability to say exactly what a publisher, a murderer, his lover, his oldest friend wanted to hear in order to court their love or trust, and seem to mean each word he said, is juxtaposed perfectly with his ability to cut them off at the knees, dismiss them, insult them, or ignore them when their needs don't suit his.The Oscar-winning performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman is astonishing, not only because his impersonation of Capote's strained, high, tiny voice and his fussy mannerisms is so remarkably good, but because he moves effortlessly between charm and seemingly endless empathy to self-absorption of enormous proportion so smoothly and naturally. We both admire and revile him. In their roles, excellent actors Chris Cooper and Catherine Keener show indulgence and affection for him, as well as wariness and disgust with his deceit of others, of them, of himself. The script is often spare and the pacing, while perfect, is never rushed; what is not said by the characters is as important and full of meaning as the well-crafted dialog. We learn just enough about any character, any situation, to be able to piece together what its meaning will be to those involved. His actions and the reactions of others are carefully calibrated so that we are never in the dark as to what is going on or how his actions will reverberate, but we are trusted to be able to let the story build in our minds; the writer, director, and actors don't spoonfeed us but deftly piece the feelings, words, and actions of the characters together so that the story builds and intermeshes exactly as it should.

Prior to watching ""Capote"" the only thing I really knew about Truman Capote was that he wrote ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""!So, this film was truly enlightening.... like the fact that he was lifelong friends with author Harper Lee (To Kill A Mockingbird) and they'd met as children. Thought it was really intersting to see how Capote came about writing his novel ""In Cold Blood"" and all the research that went into it. The movie real had me wondering as to the sincerity of Capote's friendship with Perry Smith. The movie portrays Capote as only using Perry Smith as a pawn to write his novel and only befriends Perry Smith for this purpose along.Thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman did an excellent job at portraying Capote and now see why he won the Academy Award for Best Actor!! Philip Seymour Hoffman not only looked very silimiar to Capote, but more impressive sounded just like him!I thought it wise that the screenwriters should focus the movie on one aspect of Capote's life, rather than try to focus the movie on his entire life. How can one really do a good job of focusing on one individuals life in two hours?Thought the movie was visually stunning, had striking costumes, wonderful cinematography, interesting screenplay, and dynamic performances by the cast members.....

966937,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000E33VWW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","Ostensibly ""Capote"" is the story of Truman Capote writing ""In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences,"" about the 1959 murders of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas.  The book is considered a landmark in American letters for epitomizing, if not creating (as Capote claimed), the new genre of the non-fiction novel, wherein the traditional conventions of literature were applied to a crime story.  However, by the time we fade to black and get to the title cards that let us know the rest of story, it becomes clear that ""Capote"" is trying to provide insights as to why the author of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" never finished another novel.  Publishing the novel changed American literature, but writing it changed Capote.When the Clutters are murdered, Capote reads of the story in ""The New York Times"" and decides he wants to write about it for ""The New Yorker.""  The editor, William Shawn (Bob Balaban), agrees and Capote heads for Kansas.  He connects with the head of the investigation, Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), through his wife, Marie Dewey (Amy Ryan), who is dazzled by a celebrity from New York City.  Capote does not care if the killers are caught or not, but Alvin Dewey does.  Once Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) are captured, convicted, and sentenced to death, Capote's biggest concern is keeping the two murderers alive long enough to hear what happened that night.  He helps get them new lawyers for a series of appeals, trying to get Smith, the one of the pair with whom he has established a real rapport, to provide the details.  In time that will happen, but then a horrified Capote realizes he cannot complete the book because Smith and Hickock are still alive and the story will not be over until they are executed.Capote is accompanied to Kansas by his friend, Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), who in 1959 has recently finished her book about children and a dead bird, and is trying to find a publisher.  I am drawn to the irony that Capote and Lee worte what are arguably the two most important books produced in my life time, yet neither wrote another (and there are those who claim Capote co-authored her book).  I know enough about ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" which was developed from a series of short stories based on incidents in her family history, to accept the idea that Lee had but one novel in her and that when that book is selected novel of the century there is nothing to complain about.  But it is impossible to believe the same of Capote, and the film that bears his name gives us some indication of what is lost when the author gives a public reading from his book and it becomes clear to us that ""In Cold Blood"" is as good as Capote claims.In a year when three of the Oscar nominations for Best Actor are based on not only real people but famous people whose way of talking (and singing) are well known, Hoffman's performance stands out for the moments when we are not listening to Capote's affected speech.  It does not take long in the film to distinguish between the Capote of the cocktail parties, when he clearly knows he is on stage and the one that can be persuasive when out and about in the real world.  But for me the key moments are when Capote is silent, observing and reacting to people and things.  If Hoffman wins the Best Actor Oscar tomorrow night as is expected, part of it will be because of the respected body of work he has produced in films over the last decade, but the majority will be because of this finely nuanced performance that is so far removed from the caricature it could have been that we accept him as Capote and are suitable impressed.",5,"Truman Capote goes to Kansas to write ""In Cold Blood""",1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,3685,"['Ostensibly', 'Capote', 'story', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'writing', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'True', 'Account', 'Multiple', 'Murder', 'Consequences', '1959', 'murders', 'Clutter', 'family', 'Holcomb', 'Kansas', 'book', 'considered', 'landmark', 'American', 'letters', 'epitomizing', 'not', 'creating', 'Capote', 'claimed', 'new', 'genre', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'traditional', 'conventions', 'literature', 'were', 'applied', 'crime', 'story', 'However', 'time', 'fade', 'black', 'get', 'title', 'cards', 'let', 'know', 'rest', 'story', 'clear', 'Capote', 'trying', 'provide', 'insights', 'why', 'author', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'never', 'finished', 'novel', 'Publishing', 'novel', 'changed', 'American', 'literature', 'writing', 'changed', 'Capote.When', 'Clutters', 'are', 'murdered', 'Capote', 'story', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'write', 'New', 'Yorker', 'editor', 'William', 'Shawn', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Capote', 'heads', 'Kansas', 'head', 'investigation', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'wife', 'Marie', 'Dewey', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'who', 'dazzled', 'celebrity', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Capote', 'not', 'care', 'killers', 'are', 'caught', 'not', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'Once', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Richard', 'Hickock', 'Mark', 'Pellegrino', 'are', 'captured', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Capote', 'biggest', 'concern', 'keeping', 'two', 'murderers', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'hear', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'get', 'new', 'lawyers', 'series', 'appeals', 'trying', 'get', 'Smith', 'one', 'pair', 'whom', 'established', 'real', 'rapport', 'provide', 'details', 'time', 'will', 'happen', 'then', 'horrified', 'Capote', 'can', 'not', 'complete', 'book', 'Smith', 'Hickock', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'are', 'executed.Capote', 'accompanied', 'Kansas', 'friend', 'Nelle', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'who', '1959', 'recently', 'finished', 'book', 'children', 'dead', 'bird', 'trying', 'find', 'publisher', 'am', 'drawn', 'irony', 'Capote', 'Lee', 'worte', 'are', 'arguably', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'books', 'produced', 'life', 'time', 'yet', 'wrote', 'are', 'who', 'claim', 'Capote', 'co-authored', 'book', 'know', 'enough', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'was', 'developed', 'series', 'short', 'stories', 'based', 'incidents', 'family', 'history', 'accept', 'idea', 'Lee', 'had', 'one', 'novel', 'when', 'book', 'selected', 'novel', 'century', 'nothing', 'complain', 'impossible', 'believe', 'same', 'Capote', 'film', 'name', 'indication', 'what', 'lost', 'when', 'author', 'public', 'reading', 'book', 'clear', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'as', 'good', 'Capote', 'claims.In', 'year', 'when', 'three', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Actor', 'are', 'based', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'people', 'famous', 'people', 'way', 'talking', 'singing', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'out', 'moments', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'listening', 'Capote', 'affected', 'speech', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'film', 'distinguish', 'Capote', 'cocktail', 'parties', 'when', 'clearly', 'stage', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'persuasive', 'when', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'key', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'Capote', 'silent', 'observing', 'reacting', 'people', 'things', 'Hoffman', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'tomorrow', 'night', 'expected', 'part', 'will', 'be', 'respected', 'body', 'work', 'produced', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'majority', 'will', 'be', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'caricature', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'accept', 'Capote', 'are', 'suitable', 'impressed']",N/A

It's mostly about CAPOTE, not the murderers. Hoffman deserved that oscar, but I was just a little bored with the story.After reading ""In Cold Blood,"" I was really intrigued with the Clutter family, the setting, the method of the murders, and the murderers themselves. We got to see a little of Perry in the movie, but not much of Dick.  And it seemed as if the filmmakers wanted us to sympathize with the murderers and not look as closely to their victims.I must admit I sympathized with Perry a little, not for getting caught and imprisoned, but because Capote was using him and lying to him for his book. The lie about not knowing what the title was called especially irritated me. If he's going to make an effort to write about a crime truthfully, he could at least be honest with the subjects of his writing.I did appreciate the violent flashbacks, but I wished those scenes had been extended. Crime scenes fascinate me, as I'm sure they do others, and I bet I wasn't the only disappointed viewer.It's nice to know that Capote was as self-centered, whiny, and elitist as I thought he was. I wanted to smack him when he barely gave any attention to his best friend's (Harper Lee) book and movie.

Having seen Mr. Hoffman in a number of other films, to watch him do Truman Capote here was more than a revelation--it was breathtaking.It was absolutely Mr. Hoffman channeling Truman Capote. No other description does his performance justice. THIS is the mark of acting that transcends being even great--it is astounding. If you saw him as the doofy slob boyfriend of Hope Davis in ""Next Stop Wonderland"", nothing will prepare you for his performance here. Even if you saw him as the gay neighbor of Robert DeNiro in ""Flawless""--even that is a trace of the brilliance that bursts on the screen here in ""Capote"".He forges a relationship with convicted mass murderer Perry Smith that is heartbreaking and more emotionally powerful than any conventional love story has portrayed a relationship in many years on screen. Then he can turn right around and exchange bon mots at a cocktail party and be completely convincing as a quick-witted social butterfly with a sly biting sense of humor.I have to confess that I was riveted to the screen. Catherine Keener was also really good, as was Chris Cooper and Bob Balaban and Bruce Greenwood and the actor playing Perry Smith (in fact, the latter was excellent). But this is really Hoffman's film. I think you can tell that he knows he had great material to work with; the screenwriter, Dan Futterman, did a tremendous job of conveying Capote's personality in cinematic form and Hoffman takes maximum advantage of that terrific script by nailing the character from the get-go.Right from the start we can see this is no ordinary character--it's not just that Capote is gay; he's also extremely intelligent and spoiled and at the same time extremely emotionally sensitive. This is a combination of personality traits that is almost unique--or at the very least, very very rare.""Capote"" deals with the author's life during the time of the writing of his masterwork, ""In Cold Blood""--from the moment he sees the original article in the NY Times describing the grisly murders in Kansas to the execution of the two murderers, spanning more than five years. During that time, Capote spent a lot of time interviewing Perry Smith, one of the two killers, and as much or more time in the company of his research assistant, Nell Harper Lee, who, during the course of her work with Capote, attained fame and glory herself with the publication of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" which then became a film. Catherine Keener as Lee is great.This is a must-see film and, along with ""The Squid and the Whale"" should be counted as one of the top ten American films of 2005.",5,Jaw-dropping performance by P.S.

And this film, which will probably win him an Oscar nomination, really brings out his talent.  He's cast as Truman Capote, the eccentric writer who became famous for his book ""In Cold Blood"".  At that time, Capote was already well known for ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", and was a writer for the New Yorker.  Highly intelligent and an eccentric, he was public about his lifestyle and was known for his exaggerated effete mannerisms and self absorption.The film is the story of his obsessive research for ""In Cold Blood"" and his relationship with the murderers of a Kansas farm family in 1959.  Chris Cooper is cast as the policeman in town who allows Capote access to the arrested men.  Catherine Keener is cast Nelle Harper Lee, who wrote ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".  She a dear friend of Capote's since childhood and traveled with him to help him with his research.  She and Capote smoke a lot of cigarettes and drink a lot of martinis.Capote was instrumental in helping the killers get postponements and reprieves after they were convicted.  This went on for five long years during which time Capote became more and more devoted to one of them, Perry Smith, played by Clifton Collins, Jr.  Their relationship was complex because if Perry admitted too many details, he would be re-enforcing the fact that he committed the crime. I applaud the director, Bennett Miller, for being able to capture these multifaceted elements of each of the characters.This is a really fine film.  I see many awards in its future.But then, why was I bored?  The whole film was only 90 minutes long and I must have dosed off a half dozen times.  Perhaps it was just too subtle for my taste.  After I got to understand Capote's character, the rest of the film dragged.  There was also no surprise about the outcome because I was aware of the actual story.  So therefore, ever though I do recommend Capote, I cannot give it the rave reviews that I think it deserves.  I suggest you do see Capote though.

We witness how he pioneered the ""non-fiction novel"", a concept which the likes of James Frey have recently picked up and taken to new heights. With that in mind, it's too bad that Truman largely operated before the age of crack and Oprah because he really could've been somebody.

We're accustomed to this -- a collective cross we must bear - along with consecutive weeks of 30 below temperatures in winter, (compensated-for in summer by a deserved reputation as `mosquito capitol' of North America).And we've served as backdrop to some major Hollywood films lately. Before ""Capote"" for instance, ""Shall We Dance"" was almost entirely filmed here (including all interior scenes).  But then (as always) Winnipeggers searched in vain for recognition, beyond a line in the closing credits. (There was however a fleeting reference-or-two in the ""Shall We Dance"" DVD commentary track from director Peter Chelsom.)But there's joy in Mudville this day (March 21) --  for the just-released DVD version of ""Capote"" - with its warmly expressed appreciation for ""Winterpeg.""[This city's previous claim-to-fame on American TV screens? An episode of  ""The Simpsons"" -- spoofing ""internet pharmacies"" all of which seemed to be based in this city of 700,000 -- and where the ""Highway 59, `Welcome"" sign on Winnipeg's outskirts claimed to declare in defiance to rare visitors: ""We were BORN here - What's YOUR excuse?""]----But hey -- it's the `look' of Winnipeg that made it the perfect setting for this great film! In the DVD's accompanying documentary, ""Making Capote,"" producer Caroline Baron says that the city and the 'endless prairie' appearance of surrounding farmland and towns, was simply ideal.""We were obviously looking,"" says Ms Baron, ""for some place economical to shoot, but (which) also had that look of Kansas in the late 50s and early 60s . . . AND that also could double for New York City and Brooklyn at that time - a tall order for (any one) city - and amazingly Winnipeg had that look!""The downtown (has) been preserved -- and the towns around it (are) preserved so well . . . we were able to shoot almost the entire film in-and-around Winnipeg.""Director Bennett Miller, who shares the commentary track along with his Best Actor Oscar-winner Hoffman, enthused about the local actors and extras who made the most of their moment-of-fame:""We found some great faces! 90-percent of the people in this movie came from within a five-mile radius of downtown Winnipeg.""We found an amazing local casting director Jim Heber who probably brought more than a thousand people to be considered as extras!  So every single face (you see) was `selected.' If you see a face in this movie -- they were chosen!""[Heber told a reporter for the Winnipeg Free Press newspaper, ""It's very nice to be appreciated (in this way).  You know, when you're making a `masterpiece' of the American cinema . . .  you have to have `due diligence'.""]On a separate commentary track (with his cinematographer Adam Kimmel) Director Bennett Miller expressed an appreciation bordering on awe -- for the way Winnipeggers stood in line for hours, in order to comprise the audience at a local theatre for a scene in which the film's Oscar winner Phil Hoffman reads passages of ""In Cold Blood"" to a (depicted) Manhattan audience.""It's one of those shots,"" said Miller, ""that makes me think back very affectionately towards Winnipeg and its people.""----After speaking of his personal difficulties in `nailing' the part of Truman Capote during the first week of filming, (""That's me thinking, How the hell am I going to get through this movie?"") Phil Hoffman endearingly points out the appearance of Winnipeg's gift to ballet - prima ballerina Evelyn Hart -- in a party scene:  ""The one on the right (there) is a very famous choreographer,"" he says - before director Bennett Miller corrects him on Hart's profession: ""(She's a) Ballerina,"" says Miller. ""Allison Hart? Do I have it right? EVELYN Hart! From the Royal Winnipeg Ballet.""Big smiles at that one but . . . there'll be no ""price break"" for us - except at Amazon.com. The ""suggested retail price"" in local stores is almost 37 (Canadian) dollars. Plus 14 per cent sales tax.

966954,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B000E33VWW,Mary Whipple,"[5, 6]","This brutally honest portrait of author Truman Capote, with its stunning photography (by Adam Kimmel) and Academy Award-winning acting, has been one of the most ""decorated"" films of 1995.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, Oscar-winner as Best Actor, becomes Capote in this film--small, effete, and vulnerable, but also selfish, petulant, weak, and sometimes cruel.  Catherine Keener, as Harper Lee, Capote's childhood friend, offers a stunning contrast to Hoffman's Capote.  Tall, honest, and committed to keeping Capote focused, she grounds the film, while serving as Capote's research assistant during his investigation of the cold-blooded killings of four members of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas, in 1959.At the opening of the film, the clean, flat plains and unadorned farmhouse belonging to the victims form a visual contrast with Capote's frantic life in New York.  A naive teenager's discovery of the murders, the savagery of the murders, and effects of the murders on the townspeople continue the contrasts between the harsh realities of local life and the esoteric lifestyle of Capote. When Perry Smith (sensitively played by Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Eugene Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) are arrested, and Capote makes contact with Smith, the viewer suddenly sees Capote and Smith as similar--both lonely, sad, a bit shy, and sometimes frightened.  As Perry Smith begins to confide in Capote, the similarities of their backgrounds and dysfunctional families become even more obvious.Exceptionally opportunistic, Capote is also deeply affected by Smith, feeding him when his hunger strike leaves him close to death, but also borrowing Smith's personal journals for his research because ""I don't want the world to see you as a monster.""  Sometimes abandoning Smith and Hickock for months at a time, Capote comes and goes in their lives, leaving Smith desperate at times, and causing Jack Dunphy, Capote's lover, to accuse Capote of using Smith.  As the six years pass between the crime and the publication of In Cold Blood, Capote himself deteriorates from alcohol and drugs as inexorably as Smith and Hickock have done while awaiting execution.The interactions between Hoffman, as Capote, and Collins, as Smith, lead to poignant scenes of great emotion--Capote dissembling when Smith wants to know the name of the book he is writing, Capote refusing to pay a visit to Smith until just before his execution, and Capote crying ""I did everything I could,"" when clearly he did not.  Intensely acted, sensitively directly, stunningly photographed, and hauntingly human, this memorable film takes a close, personal look at Capote and the man he fears may be his alter ego.  n  Mary Whipple",5,"Capote:  ""Perry and I grew up in the same house, and one day he went out the back door and I went out the front.""",1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,2696,"['brutally', 'honest', 'portrait', 'author', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'stunning', 'photography', 'Adam', 'Kimmel', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'acting', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'decorated', 'films', '1995', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Oscar-winner', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Capote', 'film', 'small', 'effete', 'vulnerable', 'also', 'selfish', 'petulant', 'weak', 'sometimes', 'cruel', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Capote', 'childhood', 'friend', 'stunning', 'contrast', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'Tall', 'honest', 'committed', 'keeping', 'Capote', 'focused', 'film', 'serving', 'Capote', 'research', 'assistant', 'investigation', 'cold-blooded', 'killings', 'four', 'members', 'Clutter', 'family', 'Holcomb', 'Kansas', '1959.At', 'opening', 'film', 'clean', 'flat', 'plains', 'unadorned', 'farmhouse', 'belonging', 'victims', 'form', 'visual', 'contrast', 'Capote', 'frantic', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'A', 'naive', 'teenager', 'discovery', 'murders', 'savagery', 'murders', 'effects', 'murders', 'townspeople', 'continue', 'contrasts', 'harsh', 'realities', 'local', 'life', 'esoteric', 'lifestyle', 'Capote', 'When', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'sensitively', 'played', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Richard', 'Eugene', 'Hickock', 'Mark', 'Pellegrino', 'are', 'arrested', 'Capote', 'contact', 'Smith', 'viewer', 'suddenly', 'Capote', 'Smith', 'similar', 'lonely', 'sad', 'bit', 'shy', 'sometimes', 'frightened', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'confide', 'Capote', 'similarities', 'backgrounds', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'obvious.Exceptionally', 'opportunistic', 'Capote', 'also', 'deeply', 'affected', 'Smith', 'feeding', 'when', 'hunger', 'strike', 'close', 'death', 'also', 'borrowing', 'Smith', 'personal', 'journals', 'research', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'world', 'see', 'monster', 'Sometimes', 'abandoning', 'Smith', 'Hickock', 'months', 'time', 'Capote', 'lives', 'leaving', 'Smith', 'desperate', 'times', 'causing', 'Jack', 'Dunphy', 'Capote', 'lover', 'accuse', 'Capote', 'using', 'Smith', 'six', 'years', 'pass', 'crime', 'publication', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'Capote', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'as', 'inexorably', 'Smith', 'Hickock', 'have', 'done', 'awaiting', 'execution.The', 'interactions', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'Collins', 'Smith', 'lead', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'great', 'emotion', 'Capote', 'dissembling', 'when', 'Smith', 'know', 'name', 'book', 'writing', 'Capote', 'refusing', 'pay', 'visit', 'Smith', 'just', 'execution', 'Capote', 'crying', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'when', 'clearly', 'did', 'not', 'Intensely', 'acted', 'sensitively', 'directly', 'stunningly', 'photographed', 'hauntingly', 'human', 'memorable', 'film', 'close', 'personal', 'look', 'Capote', 'man', 'may', 'be', 'alter', 'ego', 'n', 'Mary', 'Whipple']",N/A

After seeing the film I believe that my absence of any prior knowledge about the subject or the author were the best conditions under which to experience this film.  In late 1959, a Kansas family is burglarized and savagely murdered in their rural home.  Truman Capote, an established American writer of both fiction and nonfiction, notices a New York Times article about the murders and the capture of the perpetrators.  He is drawn to the story by way of the curiosity ignited when pondering the question, ""Why did they do that?""In attempting to answer that question, Capote convinces his publisher to finance a project that would result in an in-depth article (turned international nonfiction best seller) about the crime and the murderers. Assisted by life long friend and colleague Harper Lee, Capote sashays into Holcomb, Kansas to interview residents, police and the killers.  As part of his job as a journalist, Capote is required to ask questions and extract the intimate details of not only the crime but also the motivation behind it.  In order to obtain the quality of information needed, Capote sought to connect with Perry Smith, one of the murderers, in a way that created trust through shared experiences.  Smith's life experiences as half Native American, orphaned and poor, has some commonalities with Capote's experiences as gay,  orphaned (sent to live with relatives in Alabama after parents divorced), and living a life on the margin of social norms.  ""It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. And one day he went out the back door and I went out the front"", comments Capote, demonstrating the commonalities, yet extreme differences between the two.Over the course of the next few years, Capote's relationship with Smith deepens and becomes the central conflict in the film.  As the relationship intensifies and Capote sees Smith as human, vulnerable, in need; Smith, in turn, sees Capote as vulnerable, available, and in need.  The dance of manipulation and genuine care is intricate, elaborate and well portrayed throughout the film.  The film culminates with the execution of the murderers and the completion of the book.  I thought ""Capote"" a well done and artistic depiction of the events surrounding the Clutter Family massacre.  The film sufficiently sparked my interest and with a little internet research I was able to verify much of the information contained in the film as factual.  Shot in black and white with period specific accruements, the film was an excellent introduction to an American literary figure whose name was the only thing that I knew about him.

Capote takes upon a case involving two convicted killers in 1958, Perry Smith played by Clifton Collins, Jr. (Dirty, Tigerland) and Richard Hickock played by Mark Pellegrino (Mulholland Dr., The Hunted). Capote decides he's going to write a book on the 2 and how they actually killed the people and so forth. He spends time with Perry Smith a lot getting to know him, getting to know all about what happened and build on his novel which he says will be a phenomenon. The book is called ""In Cold Blood"" which I havent read yet which I heard it really good by most people who have read it and I didnt even see the movie with Robert Blake (I should get on this stuff huh?). Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers possibly his best performance so far in his career, I mean dont get me wrong this guy is good in a lot of stuff he is in but this one shows his depth and how far he went as we see on the screen as he transformed himself into Capote. Cathering Keener (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Being John Malkovich) is great as novelist and friend to Capote, Harper Lee who wrote To Kill A Mockinbird. Chris Cooper (Syriana, American Beauty) in another splendid supporting role. Clifton Collins, Jr. is superb here too playing Perry.

966965,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B000E33VWW,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[3, 11]","The competition for this year's Oscar for Best Picture of the Year is fierce. Four of the five contenders bears a partisan political message, a clear demonstration that the whiny liberal Hollywood elitists, the very same who two years ago stood as the face of their uncharismatic candidate, are not taking the second term of the Bush Administration sitting down. First we have Crash, a low-budget drama which trots out the age-old clich&eacute; that America is an inherently racist society, making life a veritable Hell for anyone who is not white or Catholic in this post-September 11th environment. It serves as a certifiable guilt-trip, pressuring its audience to praise it lest they be accused of being racist. Ironically, the second Best Picture nominee, director George Clooney's `historical' drama, Good Night and Good Luck, assumes all Republicans are paranoid bigots who irrationally assume the federal government of the United States will be infiltrated by Communists. Regardless of the fact that Senator Joseph McCarthy, the partisan picture's primary target of ridicule, was right in his assumptions, Clooney's black-and-white drama stands to serve as a reflective commentary on the `resurgence' of `McCarthyism' in post-September 11th America.The third candidate is Ang Lee's critically hailed romantic-drama, Brokeback Mountain, a film which has been condemned by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office for Film and Broadcasting as `morally offensive' for promoting homosexuality as emanating from a `deep-seated human love', while others still contend that the way in which the two leads treat each emotionally reflects poorly on the gay community. And Munich, a commentary on the continuing Israeli-Palestinian Middle East crisis, is the most surprising nominee of them all. Having been snubbed by both the BAFTA and the Golden Globes earlier this year, it is safe to assume Steven Spielberg's name may have played a vital role in the selection of this film. However, it may also have to do with the picture's message, one which some critics insists advocates a pro-Palestinian agenda. What sets Barrett Miller's directorial debut, Capote, apart as the dark-horse favorite is that it is the sole contender without a political motive.The story for Capote is nothing short of sheer brilliance. Dave Futterman's vibrant screenplay, surprisingly his first, only covers a narrow period of the writer's life, specifically the five years or so he spent tirelessly constructing his non-fiction novel, In Cold Blood, but this solitary event would forever change his life. It relies heavily on comprehensive dialogue rather then conventional imagery to portray the conflicting personalities of Truman Capote. As the picture's title and one-sheet befittingly suggest, the sole focus of the screenplay is on one man and one man alone, Truman Capote. From the very beginning audiences are presented with a frank, no-holds-bar encounter of the brilliant yet incessantly self-absorbed author. With the exception of a few select scenes scattered throughout the picture, there is not a moment in which Truman Capote is not front and center of the camera. Essentially Capote is Oscar-nominated performer Philip Seymour Hoffman's picture to command which he proceeds to do with startling refinement and pose. However, Hoffman's ingenuity in bringing the celebrated author back to life, this time on the silver screen, would have been an entirely fruitless effort if not for the poignantly crafted screenplay by Dan Futterman based on the biographical novel by Gerald Clarke. Hauntingly brilliant, Capote leaves audiences aghast long after the movie has ended.Philip Seymour Hoffman who has amassed a prodigious amount of both critical and public acknowledgment in recent months for his performance as the accomplished and narcissistic writer, Truman Capote, is decisively deserving of recognition, giving a truly Oscar-caliber performance unlike any other performer in recent Academy Award history. Hoffman gracefully balances the two seemingly diametric personalities of Truman Capote - the ostentatious New York City night owl who regales his fellow club-hoppers with tales of gossip and dirty humor and the assiduous journalist who twists and contorts the minds and feelings of others to achieve the result he so desires. This of course comes to a head when he interviews Perry Smith, a convicted murderer on death row who has the exact same duplicitous intentions with the writer as he does of him, for his non-fiction novel. Squaring off in a soaring battle of competing egos, this is a true highlight of the picture. Truman Capote was a devotedly pretentious individual, arguably one of the most pontifical journalists in American history. Although his novels, particularly Breakfast at Tiffany's and In Cold Blood, are world renowned, he himself remains an allusive and necromantic figure to this day. It is his self-dilated ego which ultimately leads to his very downfall at the hands of drug and alcohol abuse.Relative unknown actor Clifton Collins Jr. gives what can best be described as the paramount performance of his career as convicted murderer Perry Smith. In practically every way, Smith serves as a near-mirror reflection of author Truman Capote, a discovery which when confronted frightens him and leads him to a life of alcoholism and drug abuse. So much like Capote, Smith wears a distinctive mask shielding his true identity which varies depending on the situation at hand and with whom he is speaking to. From their initial encounter, Capote sees in Smith a sympathetic, artistic soul, not all that different from his own, forced unwilling into a life of crime and murder stemming from a lifetime of neglect and abuse growing up. However, we soon come to realize as we eventually do with Capote himself that this is merely an abject faade used to further his own ends. Even at the point where he details the events which led to the killing of the Clutter family, he exudes an aura of pretension deceptively portraying him as a caring soul. He heralds how he prevented his partner-in-crime Richard Hickock from raping the family's sixteen year-old daughter, Nancy, and cut down Herbert Clutter who was hanging against the wall with his hands above his head because he looked `uncomfortable'. ""I thought that Mr. Clutter was a very nice gentleman"", Smith relates to the author, ""I thought so right up to the moment that I cut his throat"". The graphic depiction of murder of each of the four family members which soon follows reveals to us the true identity of the monster, apart from the manipulations and lies.Regardless of who is the true focal point of Capote, it is author Harper Lee, demurely portrayed by Academy Award-nominated actress Catherine Keener, with whom audiences epitomize with the most. As we all might well have done in her shoes, Lee takes Truman's rather dampening and swaggering mannerisms with a sense of humor about her, wittingly playing off his egocentric persona. However, audiences will perceptibly notice a protracting shift in Lee's attitude toward her childhood friend as the picture goes on. As her own stock rises in the literary community with the publication of her first and only novel, To Kill a Mocking Bird, she becomes increasingly emotionally distant from him. She is less receptive of his cynical nature, candidly confronting him in their continued conversations. For example, in one of their last conversations together, Truman, immobilized in a fit of depression as he awaits the execution of convicted murderers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, professes to Lee that he ""couldn't have done anything to save them"". She in turn replies, ""Maybe not, Truman. But the truth is, you didn't want to"", accosting him about his self-perpetuated obsession with his book and his own celebrity and not his subject matter.And Academy Award-winning actor Chris Cooper gives an articulate performance, albeit a limited one, in the role of Alvin Dewey, sheriff of Holcomb, a small rural Kansas community where the four members of the Clutter family were murdered.Overall, Barrett Miller's major directorial debut surpasses nearly every expectation the American movie-going public has come to expect from journalistic crime-dramas and the biopic genre in general, setting a new standard in independent motion picture filmmaking. Unlike its four other Best Picture contenders, each vying ambitiously for the golden statuette at this year's Academy Awards ceremony, Capote is the least politically charged of them all. Yes, the Barrett Miller picture does confront the issue of the death penalty, but rather then deliver a lopsided opinion it instead leaves the question of capital punishment open-ended. It should be noted however that with the graphic depiction of the violent murders any argument against the death penalty in this regard is relatively mute. Although in the case of the recent execution of `Tookie' Williams, stranger things have happened. Surprisingly Truman Capote's homosexuality, an issue the American media has specifically taken up in labeling the film a politically motivated picture, is firmly downplayed. While the movie does acknowledge his partner Jack Dunphy's confidential role in the author's life at this critical juncture in his career, a role which becomes increasingly isolated as his alcohol abuse escalates, not once does the screenplay in fact directly recognize his sexual preference. Even with no previous knowledge of the journalist's lifestyle, scenes in which Truman Capote's mannerisms are flamboyant and effeminate, like when he calls his lover from a Kansas hotel wearing a female linen bathrobe, his sexuality is rather blatant. Capote's sexuality is not nor should it be an issue in this film. And even if it were, as the partisan American media would like it to be, Truman Capote's unscrupulous journalistic tactics are not the sort of principles and values the gay/lesbian community would likely epitomize. If anything in relation of politics, Capote reflects badly on the seemingly profiteering nature of the journalistic community and seedy tactics of the media in general. Dynamically scored, artistically choreographed, and rich dialogue, Capote is without question `the' movie to beat this year for Best Picture.",5,"The Moose Hole - This Year's Best Film, Hands

The most amazing aspect of the movie is it actually builds on Capote's book by providing insight into the process that doesn't exist if you have only read the book.What I found most engaging about the movie was the life given to the convicted killers. Capote did a strong job of presenting them in the book, but seeing the relationship develop between Capote and one of the criminals provides a depth missing from ""In Cold Blood.""I also find the treatment of Catherine Keener as Harper Lee quite amusing. The jokes about her ""little bird book"" were quite amusing as was Capote's obvious jealousy of the fame and attention afforded to ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""I highly recommend seeing this movie, especially if you've read ""In Cold Blood"" as the insight it provides will enrich the experiences of both the book AND the movie. However, I give it four stars because I found Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance a bit grating after awhile. That's not to take anything away from the performance overall- it was brilliant and the Oscar was richly deserved.

It's a tale about how narcissism can poison relationships and twist values. It deals with the causes and consecuences of terrible murders and it also questions the pursuit of fame and success.Born in 1924 in Alabama, Truman Capote wanted fame and success more than most. He has been described as the most perfect writer of his generation. Extravagant and eccentric, Capote was fascinated for public attention long before the concept of celebrity was part of the American culture.On Nov. 16, 1959, Capote noticed an article in a newspaper about a Kansas family who were killed. Immediately, he spoke with the editor of The New Yorker, wondering if he would be interested in an article about the murders.At first, Capote thought the story would be about how the small community was dealing with the tragedy. That was until Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, were arrested and charged with the crime. As Capote gets to know them, he's consumed by a story that would make him rich and famous, and eventually destroy him. His non-fiction novel, In Cold Blood, became a best seller, but Capote was emotionally devastated by the experience and it's been said that it haunted him to his death.Capote chronicles the unlikely friendship between writer and murderer. Capote and Smith shared a sense of defiance and loneliness, but as the film progresses, the relationship grows one-sided, and Hoffman's attitude toward Smith morphs to exploitative and manipulative.The film questions the tricky ethics of journalists and how Capote the writer was eventually overthrown by Capote the celebrity. That last Capote is the one who lingered in the public imagination, and Hoffman does a superb job at revealing the lonely as well as the extroverted public persona. What an extraordinary and brilliant performance. It will give you chills.You know you have seen a good movie when you walk out of the theater and can't stop thinking about it. For me, Capote was exactly that. It disturbed me, moved me and with blind eyes I'd recommend it to anyone.

Philip Seymour Hoffman said that one thing that attracted him to this movie was that it is not a biopic. Of course, ""Capote"" is biographical. It's about Truman Capote, but less about his life than an exploration of his ambitions, his frailties, and the 4 years Capote dedicated to the book that elevated him to the status of literary icon just as it apparently ended his career. Drawing from Gerald Clarke's biography of Capote, screenwriter Dan Futterman has written a gripping character study of a fascinating man at the peak of his talents. Shortly after the Clutter murder shocks the nation, Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) decides to cover it in an article for ""The New Yorker"". He heads to Holcomb with old friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), who blends a little better with the townsfolk. They eventually win the cooperation of Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper). And when lifelong criminals Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) are tried and convicted of the crime, Capote uses every means at his disposal to get Perry's story for what he now considers ""the book I was always meant to write"".""Capote"" boasts superb performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Clifton Collins, among others. This is the most physically challenging role I've seen Hoffman in, and portraying such a widely recognized and distinctive individual is risky. But he pulls it off -from cold ambition to swishy hilarity. Clifton Collins spends a lot of time admirably providing Hoffman someone to act off of, but when Perry's words and emotions become more vital, his performance is powerful. What makes the film truly great, however, is how deliberate it is. Director Bennett Miller has created a work of outstanding craftsmanship. Every frame of ""Capote"" is stunning, from the subdued color palette to Adam Kimmel's beautiful cinematography to the restrained depiction of Capote's manipulations and machinations. It's hypnotic. Truman Capote professed sympathy toward Perry Smith, yet he was utterly callous. He made Perry his friend, yet he wanted him dead. He claimed they had so much in common: the effete, gay, darling of the literary set and the gritty, attention-starved, mass murderer. What they had in common was perhaps not what Capote admitted. And that's fascinating.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): There is a making-of documentary in 3 parts (it says 2 parts on the menu) and 2 feature audio commentaries. ""Answered Prayers: Making Capote, Part I"" (6  min) is about Truman Capote's personality and his time in Kansas, in the words of biographer Gerald Clarke, Philip Seymour Hoffman, director Bennett Miller, and screenwriter Dan Futterman. In ""Making Capote, Part II: Concept to Script"" (17 min), Dan Futterman talks about writing the screenplay, Bennett Miller about getting the project done, and Philip Seymour Hoffman discusses creating Truman for the screen. There are shorter interviews with other cast members. ""Making Capote, Part III: Defining a Style"" (25 min) is about visual style, sets, and editing, including interviews with cinematographer Adam Kimmel, production designer Jess Gonchor, costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone, and editor Christopher Tellefsen. Both audio commentaries are low-key, casual, and contain some redundant information. The first audio commentary by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bennett Miller concentrates on acting and character development, though there is also discussion of locations, where liberties were taken in the story, and their recollections of filming. The second audio commentary by Adam Kimmel and Bennett Miller discusses pacing, editing, shots, and the film's ""observational"" perspective.

I guess I hadn't read enough reviews before I saw it since I wasn't aware of this.  I remember seeing the movie ""In Cold Blood"" as a child.  It was quite a great movie in it's own rite.  Capote was very enlightening and compelling.The movie starts with the discovery of the bodies of the murdered Kansas family in which ""In Cold Blood"" was written about.  From there we see how Capote works his way into interviewing the killers to begin writing his book.  The movie does a great job of conveying the emotion of everyone involved and what it does to life of Capote.  He becomes obsessed with one of the killers, Perry Smith, played wonderfully by Clifton Collins Jr.  He actually pays for the first of their appeals.  Capote battles his emotions as we see he actually does feel compassion for Perry while at the same time knowing the man won't talk about the night of the murders which he needs to complete his book.  It seems the only way he will be able to get his ending to his book is if the killers get the death penalty which keeps getting delayed with a series of ""stays of execution"".  Hoffman does an incredible job of portraying these mixed emotions.This is definitely one of the best movies of the year.  The performance of Hoffman alone is enough to see the film.

I would also recommend watching the original ""In Cold Blood"" film with Robert Blake playing Perry Smith, rather than the latest remake.I had read for years how writing and experiencing ""In Cold Blood"" took a big toll on Capote, and this film helps bring that home.  He wanted to help Perry Smith, but his helping prolonged the appeals process and being able to finish his book.  One can begin to see and feel the mixed feelings Truman Capote has towards the killers, especially Perry Smith.  He starts out wanting to help them, but becomes frustrated when his help has kept the appeals process dragging on for years.  He wants to finish his book but cannot until the killers are executed.  And he feels guilty for wanting them dead.  He didn't want them dead, but he did.  He visits with Perry Smith's sister who tells Capote not to be fooled by Perry and his supposed sensitivity and sweetness.  She said Perry would rather kill someone than say hello.Capote tells Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) that he felt like he and Perry grew up in the same house, only that Perry got up and went out the back door, and he (Capote) got up and went out the front door.  They both had alcoholic mothers and abusive or neglectful fathers.Towards the end when Perry telegrams Capote asking for help to find a new lawyer, Capote writes back that he searched for one (he really didn't) but couldn't find one.  Capote takes to his bed and won't take phone calls when he hears the executions are finally going through - no more appeals.  He goes to Kansas and visits with the killers one last time and starts to cry when he walks in the room.  Perry asks him to be at the hanging and he agrees, even though he probably would have rather been in bed with the covers pulled over his head.The extra interviews with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Chris Cooper, Catherine Keener et al really add to the DVD.

No doubt Phillip Seymour Hoffman turns in a remarkably understated performance as writer Truman Capote goes through an exhaustive 6 year creative process to write ""In Cold Blood.""

The juxtaposition of Capote, the twisted soul writer, and Perry Smith, the twisted soul killer, reveals the thin line between people who follow different paths in life.

When the movie begins, Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is fresh off the success of Breakfast at Tiffany's. He's looking for a new story to write, and he stumbles across a newspaper story about some brutal murders in Kansas.He heads to the tiny town that has been turned upside down by the tragedy and quickly realizes that the raw material there will help him create the best book he's ever written. As part of his research, Capote develops a close relationship with one of the accused killers, Perry White. As a viewer, I was unsure whether or not his relationship was genuine or self-serving, and I think that's the way director Bennett Miller wanted it.Over the course of four years, Capote works with Perry, trying to get him to tell him the story of the night of the murders. In the end, Capote publishes one of the most revolutionary novels of the 20th century - In Cold Blood. However, the experience clearly takes its toll on Capote, whose career follows a steady downward trend after In Cold Blood's marvelous success.

This film is a dramatized biopic of Capote's relationship with convicted killer Perry Smith, which leads Capote to write In Cold Blood, arguably the first nonfiction novel.I admit that I initially thought Hoffman was mocking Capote's sexual orientation and effeminate mannerisms.  But Hoffman was very true to the real Capote, and as the movie progressed, I believed Hoffman's performance completely.Keener gives an understated performance as Harper Lee.  She is at once Capote's companion, fellow author, admirer, and mother figure.  Given that there are long periods in the film when Lee is not with Capote, Keener's ability to make Lee's influence on Capote felt is a credit to both Keener and Hoffman.Collins, Jr. nearly steals the movie.  His complex performance as Perry Smith hits every emotion perfectly.  The chemistry between Collins, Jr. and Hoffman is spectacular.  Although Hoffman is the film's star and Capote was certainly a self-centered man, the viewer believes wholeheartedly that Capote would sympathize with Smith and even fall in love with him; thus, it's very appropriate that Hoffman lets Collins, Jr. take control of pivotal scenes.Capote's proximity to the subjects of his work challenges the ""nonfiction-ness"" of In Cold Blood, but no one can say that the novel isn't a book of truth.  Likewise, the viewer of this film perhaps comes away somewhat confused about the moral character of Capote, but this in no way detracts from the truths about Capote in this wonderful film.",4,"Great performances by Hoffman, Keener, and Collins, Jr.",1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,1679,"['success', 'film', 'heavily', 'performances', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'film', 'dramatized', 'biopic', 'Capote', 'relationship', 'convicted', 'killer', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'write', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'arguably', 'first', 'nonfiction', 'novel.I', 'admit', 'initially', 'thought', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'mocking', 'Capote', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'effeminate', 'mannerisms', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'very', 'true', 'real', 'Capote', 'movie', 'progressed', 'believed', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'completely.Keener', 'understated', 'performance', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'once', 'Capote', 'companion', 'fellow', 'author', 'admirer', 'mother', 'figure', 'Given', 'are', 'long', 'periods', 'film', 'when', 'Lee', 'not', 'Capote', 'Keener', 'ability', 'make', 'Lee', 'influence', 'Capote', 'felt', 'credit', 'Keener', 'Hoffman.Collins', 'Jr.', 'nearly', 'movie', 'complex', 'performance', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'emotion', 'perfectly', 'chemistry', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Hoffman', 'spectacular', 'Hoffman', 'film', 'star', 'Capote', 'was', 'certainly', 'self-centered', 'man', 'viewer', 'wholeheartedly', 'Capote', 'would', 'sympathize', 'Smith', 'even', 'fall', 'love', 'thus', 'very', 'appropriate', 'Hoffman', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'take', 'control', 'pivotal', 'scenes.Capote', 'proximity', 'subjects', 'work', 'nonfiction-ness', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'novel', ""n't"", 'book', 'truth', 'Likewise', 'viewer', 'film', 'perhaps', 'away', 'somewhat', 'confused', 'moral', 'character', 'Capote', 'way', 'truths', 'Capote', 'wonderful', 'film']",N/A

This is after the premiere of the movie ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". With incredible patience, she asks him what he thought of the movie and even more incredibly, he doesn't seem to have even watched it. As she walks off, obviously upset, he murmurs to himself that he doesn't see what all the fuss is about.A part of me felt that way about this movie. As talented a writer as Truman Capote may have been, if this portrayal is true to what he was like (and apparently it is), then I wonder how anyone could've stood to be in the same room as him for more than a minute at a time. The early days of celebrity worship maybe? I found him totally creepy and narcissistic on a level I have never seen before in real life or in fiction. It was all about him and even the man he lived with an assumedly was having a relationship with, seemed to mean little more to him than a piece of furniture. He's the sun and everyone else is just a mere planet revolving around him.But anyway. The movie is about how Capote, in researching his 'non-ficiton novel' ""In Cold Blood"", developed a relationship with one of the two convicted killers he is writing about. It's really difficult to determine whether he develops a genuine affection for one of the killers, called Perry Smith, or whether he's simply using him to get the information he needs for his work. I don't want to give away any plot details but even at the very end it doesn't seem any clearer and that just adds to the overall creepiness of the Capote character. That said, like a car crash, it was impossible to look the other way. It was creepily entertaining.Or should I say entertainingly creepy?And maybe THAT's what the fuss is all about. It would seem that Philip Seymour Hoffman inhabited the character of Truman Capote and even though he looks and sounds nothing like him in real life, he does both in this movie in a way that is almost scary and thus the Oscar he won is well deserved.

966992,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B000E33VWW,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[0, 1]","Capote, like many true crime genre films, has the advantages of being able to fallow an already pre-paved formula built around discoveries and pay offs. The other advantage is that more often then not, this type of story revolves around an act that is far outside the path of most of man kinds cautiously lived lives. Most people live there lives in such a way that they try to avoid conflict. I am no exception to this well ingrained way of existing, it is afterall the basis of what we call being civilized. We have all had experiences in our childhood where we have either participated or seen large groups of children, and sometimes even adults, fallow an ambulance to a location to gawk at the atrocity that awaits. If it is something that is particularly bloody, like a rather nasty traffic accident, it tends to bring a larger crowd of spectators. Like kids in a playground running to watch a fight, a true crime film by its very nature already comes equipped with a well baited hook to draw us curiosity seekers in. We are afterall going to see something that we will more then likely never experience in our own tame controlled normality. Films like The Hunt For The Unicorn killer, Boys Don't Cry, Mississippi Burning, Jasper Texas, The Hillside Strangler, Monster, The Accused, and Indictment starring James Woods, are examples of a few films that I can come up with off the top of my head that fallow the priciples of true crime genre story telling. All these films share the same type of pre-existing story design, and all these films work and are very much worth watching. The only real deviation outside of the characters involved, is in who the protagonist is going to be. Is it a film about the perpatrator of the crime? Or is it a film about the cops who solve it? Is it going to be a film about the friends and family members who grieve and fight for justice? Or is it about some other entity involved in the case? It is in this way that a true crime story can find its own originality, and seperate itself from other films in its genre.Capote is no exception from this true crime formula, and director Bennett Miller does a fine job of keeping the vessel with in the confinds of these well groved tracks. The original aspect to this films story telling design is that of the character of Capote himself. Here we have a flamboyant socialite, decked out in the finest threads money can buy, speaking brilliant English with his dandy limp-wristed accent, and on top of all this, has a rather sizable desire to be the very social center of the entire universe. The juxtaposition of this extremely unusual one of a kind character to the salt of the Earth folks that are found in America's heart land, adds a nice bit of spice to this already intriguing dramatic stew. Furthermore, Capote is a very flawed human being with a poor tendency to drink, he is in short an alcoholic. On top of all this, he falls in love in the most idealistic sense with the main incarcerated murderer. Though this lends itself well in the impassioned writing of his legendary book ""In Cold Blood"", it also crosses his motives and passions up into a tangled mess. Capote,dispite his apparent love for the captured killer, is not above lying and manipulating to achieve the ends to his means. Cleary he will stop at nothing to to find the sordid reasons behind the very killings themselves. On the one hand he seems to do all he can to help these two lost souls, including using his fame to find them the best lawyers available. While on the other hand he is not above seeing them executed to achieve the perfect ending to his book. In the end these very twisted desires lead to the downfall of the real Truman Capote himself, as such, In Cold Blood ended up being the last book he would ever write. The film is full of fine performances, including the Oscar winning performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and as mentioned, Bennett Miller does a fine job of not letting the film stagger off track. Yet for all that is done right, there is still one major problem that ultimately hinders the watch-ability of this film.I loved my red shoes.My first memory in life was of running on a grassy slope in a park while looking down at my feet. I can still remember how captivated I was with my bright red shoes. It was not until I was older and looked at the photo from this event, that I realized that I was barely two years old when these memories took place. I bring up this early childhood memory to illustrate just where the major problem lies in this film. In an ill fated attempt to manipulate a shift of focus with-in the viewer from the visuals to the importance of the story, Bennett Miller chose to desaturate much of the color out of the movie. In the process he bleached out nearly all of the visual stimulation. To me the notion to do this was a complete utter oxymoron, cinema, by definition, is a visual art form. What confounds me even more about this directorial decision is that Capote is already a very languid film anyway. Outside of the brief instance in which the flashback of the actual crime is shown, there is no activity to be found anywhere in this film. Capote takes place in a flat nearly treeless landscape, dull police buildings with blank walls, and inside dank dingy jail cells. It is a film in which two people sit in an empty cell and talk for long periods of film time. If anything, Capote needed all the visual stimulation it could get its hands on. Now I should point out that one of my all time favorite films just happens to be 12 Angry Men, which is in black and white and takes place in a single room. The difference here is that despite these limitations, 12 Angry Men is visually appealing. The tone and shading to that picture registers as lush, rich, and delicious to the eye. The same can not be said about Capote, which only manages to make my eyelids go heavy like I am going under hypnosis. The admiration I feel for 12 Angry Men should hopefully quell any notion that I lack an attention span and need car chases and explosions to stay interested in a film. No, I believe that more then just the color was desaturated durring the process of removing the highlights out of the film stock. To me, it is as if the very aura of the film was rendered sedate, stagnant, and lifeless.Capote, an all natural home remedy.I'll be perfectly honest with you, I own a copy of this film. Yet every time I attempt to watch it, I end up falling asleep. Usually by the time that detective Alvin Dewey (played by Chris Cooper) briefs the media and other concerned citizens about how the police will stop at noting to catch the criminals, I am pretty much counting my first sheep. Maybe its only me and I have rocks in my head or something, but between the desaturation of color and the blankness of this films energy, I can not get past the first half hour of screen time without feeling like I just took a couple of melatonin tablets. The stagnant lack of energy that permeates the very pores of this movie began to put me down with such astounding regularity that I actually decided to keep the film and use it as a sleep aid. I have always been a bit of an insomniac. The funny thing is, is that Bennett Miller chose to desaturate this film in order to enforce a viewers concentration on the story, not to cause them to go under sedation and miss half of the film. I can only conclude by saying that Capote could teach a great lesson to film makers in what not to do, for as my fist memory illustrates, its stimulation that places memories into our minds, not the lack of it.",3,Breakthrough cure for Insomnia.,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,7596,"['Capote', 'many', 'true', 'crime', 'genre', 'films', 'advantages', 'being', 'able', 'fallow', 'already', 'pre-paved',

966993,A22F3BWM7RAHDA,B000E33VWW,P. B. Sharp,"[0, 0]","In a way  ""In Cold Blood"" is Truman Capote's epitaph or at least the epitaph of his writing genius. He never wrote anything of worth afterwards and he slowly sank into alcoholism while his friend Harper Lee was lionized for her book ""To kill a Mockingbird."" Her star rose as Truman's set. It might even be said that murderer Perry Smith and Truman Capote died together.The recent death of Phillip Seymour Hoffman galvanized me to see him in ""Capote"" and his portrayal of the iconic author is superb, from his physical appearance to his speech patterns to his gestures, You forget right away that you are listening to and watching an actor. Hoffman becomes Truman Capote. Capote was in many ways a very strange man, and Hoffman grasps his personality, his very oddness, but you feel his genius hovering there beneath the surface of his often frivolous remarks. Simultaneously, you detect a latent depression, feelings of inferiority which he tries to cover up with alcohol and a sort of cheeky bravado.You learn that ""cold blood"" according to this film, refers not  to the actual senseless murders of the Clutter family, but the ruthlessness Capote had to force himself to employ as a means of extracting the truth from the two murderers  about the killings- he manipulated Smith and Hickok. I don't agree with this premise. In ""cold blood is the senseless murders and Capote did not manipulate the killers. That he fell in love with Perry Smith is certainly implied but he  courageously had to at least harness his feelings in order to do the research for ""In Cold Blood"" and to weave his tapestry out of the threads of those researches.The gloomy atmosphere and the starkness of the Great Plains which envelop the murder victims' house, the monotonous browns of winter, the gaunt skeletal branches of the leafless trees, the cawing of crows, the hollow sounds of the wind, create an environment that can make you shiver right in your computer chair.

966997,A30I207MIU383O,B000E33VWW,"Phillip E. Hardy ""Phillip E. Hardy""","[3, 4]","Capote(Sony Classics)Directed by: Bennett MillerCast: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins, Chris CooperIn 1959, Dwight Eisenhower was President of the United States, Fidel Castro methodically seized power in Cuba, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper died in a small plane crash and Alaska and Hawaii became the 49th and 50th states. On a dreary November day of that same year, two petty crooks drove to an obscure Midwestern town named Holcomb Kansas, where one of them brutally murdered a family of four, sending shockwaves reverberating throughout America. Truman Capote was a successful writer living in New York, who at age 23 had achieved notoriety with his first book, called Other Voices, Other Rooms and was enjoying greater critical acclaim for a breezy romantic novella he had recently completed titled Breakfast at Tiffany's. With a yearning to satiate his creative hunger, Capote was looking for a sensational media event to chronicle in a non fiction story; one that would be unlike anything ever written. In mid November of 1959, while reading the New York Times, the 35 year old writer found what he was looking for.Capote brilliantly tells the tale of how a gifted artist followed his instincts, hopped on a train to travel to America's heartland and painstakingly assembled the narrative details of this infamous evening, by psychologically dissecting the mind of a killer. The film is a straightforward account of how this seemingly demure man used his disarming wit and superior skills of manipulation to collect the information required to fashion his masterpiece In Cold Blood. And though there is much debate over how he didn't use notes while compiling his research (a detail the movie explains by demonstrating Capote's astonishingly accurate sense of recall), it is certain he created a chilling depiction of the Clutter family massacre.When Truman Capote (Hoffman), arrives in Kansas with his traveling companion Harper Lee (Keener), who later wrote To Kill a Mockingbird, they are treated with indifference by authorities investigating the murder. After Truman and Harper meet and ingratiate themselves with lead investigator Alvin Dewey's (Cooper) wife Marie, the pair is introduced into the inner circle of the people examining the sordid details of the crime. When the suspects are finally apprehended, in an amusing sequence, Capote brings the Sheriff's wife breakfast to bribe his way into meet accused killer Perry Smith (Collins Jr.)Spending hours commiserating with him in his cramped jail cell, Capote befriends Smith when both men discover their common experience of suffering childhood abuses. After they are convicted of murder and sentenced to death by hanging, Truman lends his assistance in securing more competent legal counsel for Smith and his partner in crime Richard Hitchcock (Mark Pellegrino). This positions him as less of a journalist and more as an active participant in case; as the killers, particularly Smith, form an attachment to him. When Dewey reads the newspaper about the writer's involvement on behalf of the condemned men, he warns Truman if they escape justice, he will come to New York, track him down and kill him.With the original intent of writing a human interest article for New Yorker Magazine, it becomes clear to Truman that the Clutter family story would provide him with a sensational novel. With half of his manuscript completed, he sends it to William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his New York publisher. Astonished at the quality of the work, he informs Truman he will have a profound influence on the landscape of the literary world. Subsequently, Shawn has Capote perform a reading of excerpts from his unfinished novel, where he receives a standing ovation. After the enormous buzz created by this promotional event, the die is cast and Truman must follow the story to the increasingly bitter end to faithfully record the fate of Smith and Hickcock.In his quest to complete In Cold Blood, Truman Capote was compelled to invest five emotionally draining years of his life. He became not only a witness but was actively drawn into the aftermath of a violent nightmare, to become the primary confidant of a consummately evil criminal. Yet Capote saw him as a sensitive, scared little boy underneath the nefarious veneer. This took a toll on his mental health and nearly caused him to miss the finale of the story. In a deeply revealing scene, publisher Shawn telephones Harper Lee to prevail upon her friend to visit the murderous duo on their last night on earth. It takes every measure of Truman's moral courage to meet with Hickcock and Smith; and upon their final request, watch their executions.For his work on Capote, director Bennett Miller has fully realized the classic story of how in his quest to gain the world, a man loses his soul. After writing In Cold Blood, Truman became the most celebrated author in America but never wrote another book. The film gives you an intimate look at how such a gifted novelist invested so much in one project, to the point where he never had the desire to complete another one. Additionally, Miller uses the bleak gray Kansas atmosphere to reinforce the ominous fate that lies ahead for the killers and the endless waiting game Capote faces as he awaits their execution.Though released in late September, Capote is once again making the rounds at your local movie theatre, as it will certainly garner an Oscar nomination for Philip Seymour Hoffman. Though all the acting is uniformly excellent, Hoffman's performance as the flamboyant Capote is masterwork of a journeyman performer. He is in nearly every single frame of the film and never loses character for a nanosecond. He is your guide in telling the story within the story. In a somewhat spotty year for meaty plot lines, this is a motion picture that offers a glimpse at one of the most interesting dramas ever told. In Cold Blood became an American version of a Greek Tragedy; one where even the storyteller was unable to remain unscathed.Reviewed byPhillip E.

967000,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,B000E33VWW,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[2, 4]","Two very engaging and very compelling things are centerpieces for works that people keep coming back to again and again: psychopaths and artists.  Especially when both are slightly insane or egotistic, the analysis of brains abnormal and uncomprehended are fascinating and wondrous motifs that re-occur in literature and media again and again.This movie has both, a very contradictory and egotistic mind, Truman Capote's, matched with the alarmingly sweet and charismatic mind of a psychopath, Perry Smith, who Truman falls in love with and interviews for research to write his best-selling and important work, In Cold Blood.The result is very affecting.  Hoffman's zealous and defined portrayal of Capote is matched by the outstanding performance of Clifton Collin's Jr., the lonely and slightly terrifying face of a killer who is human and humanized.The real drama comes from Capote's terrifyingly manipulative mind.  For someone who didn't know much about Capote before I entered the theatre, Hoffman's performance was simply shocking.  The commercials and advertising and posters and the like would have you imagine that Capote was a very strong artistic trope, like other biopics that show brilliant artists and their troubles.  However, a couple of things should be noted... first, this is not a biopic.  Second, Capote's flamboyantly homosexual and confrontationally controversial mannerisms both set the man himself apart from the type of character we like to see from artists, and also set Hoffman's performance apart from basically anything we've ever seen before.A side-result is a very discomforting and contradictory look.  Capote lies, manipulates, cheats... and yet the presentation of these events help us concern ourselves with his character so much that we can't help but want every part of his innermost desires to actualize.  We have a man who kills, but he's also lonely and afraid and willing to cling on to anybody who will give him attention.  We empathize with characters we'd normally shun, yet simultaneously feel uncomfortable being so close to them, thus wanting to know more about them so that we can come to terms with who they are.And at the end, when we see the denouement of what is both a perverse and a relatable relationship, the movie centers in on Smith's heavy breathing as he awaits his doom and the audience breaths heavily along with him, feeling all hope begin to fade from the screen as the deranged Capote watches on.

Why did they do that? Two worlds exist in this country: the quiet conservative life, and and the life of those two men - the underbelly, the criminally violent. Those two worlds converged that bloody night. ""Phillip Seymour Hoffman becomes the man, Capote. A masterful performance that all but takes this film and turns it into a study of a writer and his behavior, and how he comes to write the novel of his life. The director, Bennett Miller, has also taken this chance to fully realize his life's work and has put together the film of his lifetime. Together this is the best film of last year.  Capote has shown the manipulative behavior he assumed to get into the minds of the two murderers who committed an atrocious murder in Kansas in 1959. At the same time, one of the murderers, Perry, also plays Capote. The result is a fascinating read ""In Cold Blood"" And, as the film progresses we come to understand that the title of the film not only portrays the horrific killing, but the behavior of the author in obtaining the ""real story"". Insight into Capote's mind is a satisfying look, but also a feeling of looking into the mind of a damaged soul. As a CNN reviewer has said ""Hoffman doesn't impersonate the eccentric author; instead he appears to embody him. He never overly imitates the well-known, and often mocked, speech patterns or mannerisms of the man, but rather nails his essences without turning to parody. (It's saying something that Hoffman, who stands 5-foot-10, effortlessly captures the diminutive Capote without ever calling attention to his height."" Well done, Mr. Hoffman.Capote has a childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) -- soon to write her one and only novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", assist him in the gathering of facts and writing of the novel. Catherine Keener provides a warm and human side to this film.Chris Cooper plays the, Kansas investigator Alvin Dewey, and his portrayal is brilliant. Clifton Collins Jr., as Perry Smith, plays a cat-and-mouse game with Capote; always realizing deep down that it's the story, Capote wants. This film is dark and somber most of the time, but it shines in the performances.  A vivid portrayal of four horrific murders, the telling of the story, the writing of the book and the selling of Capote's soul to obtain the story of his lifetime.Highly recommended. prisrob 8-26-06",5,Cold Blooded Behavior,1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,2487,"['Truman', 'Capote', 'night', 'November', '14th', 'two', 'men', 'broke', 'quiet', 'farmhouse', 'Kansas', 'murdered', 'entire', 'family', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'Two', 'worlds', 'exist', 'country', 'quiet', 'conservative', 'life', 'life', 'two', 'men', 'underbelly', 'criminally', 'violent', 'two', 'worlds', 'converged', 'bloody', 'night', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'man', 'Capote', 'masterful', 'performance', 'film', 'study', 'writer', 'behavior', 'how', 'write', 'novel', 'life', 'director', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'also', 'taken', 'chance', 'fully', 'realize', 'life', 'work', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'lifetime', 'Together', 'best', 'film', 'last', 'year', 'Capote', 'shown', 'manipulative', 'behavior', 'assumed', 'get', 'minds', 'two', 'murderers', 'who', 'committed', 'atrocious', 'murder', 'Kansas', '1959', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'murderers', 'Perry', 'also', 'Capote', 'result', 'fascinating', 'read', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'film', 'come', 'understand', 'title', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'horrific', 'killing', 'behavior', 'author', 'obtaining', 'real', 'story', 'Insight', 'Capote', 'mind', 'satisfying', 'look', 'also', 'feeling', 'looking', 'mind', 'damaged', 'soul', 'CNN', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Hoffman', ""n't"", 'impersonate', 'eccentric', 'author', 'instead', 'embody', 'never', 'overly', 'well-known', 'often', 'mocked', 'speech', 'patterns', 'mannerisms', 'man', 'rather', 'essences', 'turning', 'parody', 'saying', 'something', 'Hoffman', 'who', '5-foot-10', 'effortlessly', 'diminutive', 'Capote', 'ever', 'calling', 'attention', 'height', 'Well', 'done', 'Mr.', 'Hoffman.Capote', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Nelle', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'soon', 'write', 'one', 'only', 'novel', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'assist', 'gathering', 'facts', 'writing', 'novel', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'warm', 'human', 'side', 'film.Chris', 'Cooper', 'Kansas', 'investigator', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'portrayal', 'brilliant', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'Capote', 'always', 'realizing', 'deep', 'story', 'Capote', 'film', 'dark', 'somber', 'most', 'time', 'performances', 'vivid', 'portrayal', 'four', 'horrific', 'murders', 'telling', 'story', 'writing', 'book', 'selling', 'Capote', 'soul', 'obtain', 'story', 'lifetime.Highly', 'recommended', 'prisrob', '8-26-06']",N/A

""Capote"" is a film that repeatedly delves deeper into a mystery only to be met with unsatisfactory suspense.  ""Capote"" is the tale of a writer who acheived his greatest work at the cost of his own soul, while also being a tale that takes 2 wasted hours to tell it.  This chronicle of Truman Capote's research and creation of ""In Cold Blood"", his greatest and last novel, is similar to its title character in many ways...and that's not a compliment.  As you have probably guessed, I really don't like this movie.I give all the praise possible to character actor-turned-star Philip Seymour Hoffman, who perfects the mannerisms and motivations of a heartless and cold writer.  Capote, as I gathered from this biopic, was a maniuplative bastard who knew how to write some good literature.  The way that this man could say the most hurtful things to another human being, while lying to them at the same time, is really interesting to watch.  I wouldn't have picked Hoffman to win the Oscar, but he has definitely given the best performance of his career!What made this movie work so ineffectively for me was the pacing.  It's too patient and quiet.  I didn't want a musical score to undermine the hard-working actors, but there's no sense of progression or control.  The movie isn't all over the place with its plot or unfocused; instead, this is a rare film that is too into the moment.  Director Bennett Miller is interested in the current scene that plays, but misses the big picture.  Miller loves the relationship between Capote and the two Kansas killers, but he doesn't understand that the overall picture does not work because their conversations are increasingly vague and tedious.  Hoffman brilliantly portrays an author who descends into depression and self-destruction, but Miller only lets us onto that when the final act rolls around.  I felt some heartbreak when Capote cries, when Capote drinks, when Capote remains isolated and alone...but why couldn't Miller show us that a downfall was in progression?  Come to think of it, ""Capote"" finally has some life breathed into during the last half-hour.  That's a hell of a long wait for Bennett Miller to pull away from the puzzle pieces and show the completed picture.""Capote"" is not a mystery, it is not a tragedy, it is not a thriller, it is not a love story, and I wouldn't even call it a drama.  This film isn't much of anything: the supporting characters are underdeveloped, the emotion is lacking, the mood is too subtle, the pacing is too patient, and the well-spoken dialogue and well-acted scenes are let down by a poorly-written plot.  ""Capote"" is a dreary and dull story that only makes sense when it's over, and only captivates when it's too late.  ""Capote"" is not much of anything, which is a disappointing way to portray the origin of one of the greatest works in American literature.",2,A Film As Heartless  As Its Title Character,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,2994,"['Capote', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'so', 'absorbed', 'own', 'world', 'audience', 'who', 'be', 'entertained', 'Capote', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'deeper', 'mystery', 'only', 'be', 'met', 'unsatisfactory', 'suspense', 'Capote', 'tale', 'writer', 'who', 'acheived', 'greatest', 'work', 'cost', 'own', 'soul', 'also', 'being', 'tale', '2', 'wasted', 'hours', 'tell', 'chronicle', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'research', 'creation', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'greatest', 'last', 'novel', 'similar', 'title', 'character', 'many', 'ways', 'not', 'compliment', 'have', 'probably', 'guessed', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie.I', 'give', 'praise', 'possible', 'character', 'actor-turned-star', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'mannerisms', 'motivations', 'heartless', 'cold', 'writer', 'Capote', 'gathered', 'biopic', 'was', 'maniuplative', 'bastard', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'write', 'good', 'literature', 'way', 'man', 'could', 'say', 'most', 'hurtful', 'things', 'human', 'being', 'lying', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'interesting', 'watch', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'picked', 'Hoffman', 'win', 'Oscar', 'definitely', 'given', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'What', 'made', 'movie', 'work', 'so', 'ineffectively', 'was', 'pacing', 'too', 'patient', 'quiet', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'musical', 'score', 'undermine', 'hard-working', 'actors', 'sense', 'progression', 'control', 'movie', ""n't"", 'place', 'plot', 'unfocused', 'instead', 'rare', 'film', 'too', 'moment', 'Director', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'interested', 'current', 'scene', 'big', 'picture', 'Miller', 'relationship', 'Capote', 'two', 'Kansas', 'killers', ""n't"", 'understand', 'overall', 'picture', 'not', 'work', 'conversations', 'are', 'increasingly', 'vague', 'tedious', 'Hoffman', 'brilliantly', 'author', 'who', 'depression', 'self-destruction', 'Miller', 'only', 'when', 'final', 'act', 'rolls', 'felt', 'heartbreak', 'when', 'Capote', 'cries', 'when', 'Capote', 'drinks', 'when', 'Capote', 'isolated', 'alone', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'Miller', 'show', 'downfall', 'was', 'progression', 'Come', 'think', 'Capote', 'finally', 'life', 'breathed', 'last', 'half-hour', 'hell', 'long', 'wait', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'pull', 'away', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'show', 'completed', 'picture', 'Capote', 'not', 'mystery', 'not', 'tragedy', 'not', 'thriller', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'call', 'drama', 'film', ""n't"", 'much', 'anything', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'emotion', 'lacking', 'mood', 'too', 'subtle', 'pacing', 'too', 'patient', 'well-spoken', 'dialogue', 'well-acted', 'scenes', 'are', 'let', 'down', 'poorly-written', 'plot', 'Capote', 'dreary', 'dull', 'story', 'only', 'sense', 'when', 'only', 'when', 'too', 'late', 'Capote', 'not', 'much', 'anything', 'disappointing', 'way', 'portray', 'origin', 'one', 'greatest', 'works', 'American', 'literature']",N/A

Geatz,"[2, 5]","Phillip Seymour Hoffman rightfully got the lion's share of attention for the film ""Capote,""--it's truly one of those transformative performances--but it's the sum of its wonderful parts that made this movie much more than a star vehicle. All of the performances are outstanding, as is the design, cinematography and script--and it's rare these days to see such mature, nuanced and intelligent filmmaking.If we are to believe ""Capote,"" ""In Cold Blood"" was both the pinnacle of the author's rising genius and the point from which he steadily plummeted to the nadir of his existence as an unproductive, party-hopping, self-destructive cliche. And one can certainly believe the premise. Capote's self-absorbed desire for literary fame ultimately required him to sell his soul to exploit the loneliness, desire and false hope of a very troubled criminal--with whom the diminutive writer felt an ironic kinship.You truly feel the complicated moral tensions in the movie--ultimately, the desire to help a fellow outcast versus the need to see him dead.  We are encouraged to sympathize with Perry Smith, the pathetic and oddly articulate suspect. We identify the neglect and abuse of his childhood with Capote's own--which makes his ultimate confession to the author all the more chilling. The killing was more cold blooded than we (or Capote) thought possible. But the chill quickly transfers to our feelings for Capote, himself, when we realize the extent to which he--like a cat playing with the mouse he will eventually devour--has manipulated his subject for his own needs.  And once the confession is cunningly extracted, the confessor's execution can't come fast enough.It's a devastating ""portrait of the artist as a young man."" Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, among others, has often portrayed the artist in his movies as a vampire who coldly sucks the life from his subject for the sake of his art, and one can think of fewer real-life examples than that of Truman Capote and ""In Cold Blood."" Perhaps the title was more prescient than Capote realized at the time; in retrospect,the blood in his own veins seems rather reptilian.",5,Great performances in a great film,1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,2133,"['Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'rightfully', 'got', 'lion', 'share', 'attention', 'film', 'Capote', 'truly', 'one', 'transformative', 'performances', 'sum', 'wonderful', 'parts', 'made', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'star', 'vehicle', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'design', 'cinematography', 'script', 'rare', 'days', 'see', 'such', 'mature', 'nuanced', 'intelligent', 'filmmaking.If', 'are', 'believe', 'Capote', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'was', 'pinnacle', 'author', 'rising', 'genius', 'point', 'steadily', 'plummeted', 'nadir', 'existence', 'unproductive', 'party-hopping', 'self-destructive', 'cliche', 'one', 'can', 'certainly', 'believe', 'premise', 'Capote', 'self-absorbed', 'desire', 'literary', 'fame', 'ultimately', 'required', 'sell', 'soul', 'exploit', 'loneliness', 'desire', 'false', 'hope', 'very', 'troubled', 'criminal', 'whom', 'diminutive', 'writer', 'felt', 'ironic', 'kinship.You', 'truly', 'feel', 'complicated', 'moral', 'tensions', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'desire', 'help', 'fellow', 'outcast', 'need', 'see', 'dead', 'are', 'encouraged', 'sympathize', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'pathetic', 'oddly', 'articulate', 'suspect', 'identify', 'neglect', 'abuse', 'childhood', 'Capote', 'own', 'ultimate', 'confession', 'author', 'more', 'chilling', 'killing', 'was', 'more', 'cold', 'blooded', 'Capote', 'thought', 'possible', 'chill', 'quickly', 'transfers', 'feelings', 'Capote', 'when', 'realize', 'extent', 'cat', 'playing', 'mouse', 'will', 'eventually', 'devour', 'manipulated', 'subject', 'own', 'needs', 'once', 'confession', 'cunningly', 'extracted', 'confessor', 'execution', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'fast', 'enough.It', 'devastating', 'portrait', 'artist', 'young', 'man', 'Swedish', 'filmmaker', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'others', 'often', 'portrayed', 'artist', 'movies', 'vampire', 'who', 'coldly', 'life', 'subject', 'sake', 'art', 'one', 'can', 'think', 'fewer', 'real-life', 'examples', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'Perhaps', 'title', 'was', 'more', 'prescient', 'Capote', 'realized', 'time', 'retrospect', 'blood', 'own', 'veins', 'rather', 'reptilian']",N/A
967010,A2OLM3EXS7JHZ8,B000E33VWW,"Richard Posner ""wordspinner""","[2, 2]","I'd never gotten to see ""Capote"" when it was in release, so I checked out the DVD from the local library. I think this is the way to see this chilly and internal movie. If anything, you can take a break when the excruciatingly slow pace causes moss to grow on your chair.The story  shows how Capote--a tormented, freakish Southern writer living in New York off praise and recognition--destroys whatever soul he possesses when he writes ""In Cold Blood."" He lies to himself and everyone else, he cajoles and betrays, he whines and deceives, he hurts his friend, his lover, and the two poor jerks who got themselves hanged after many stays of execution. It's become de rigeuer to paint the killers, especially Perry Smith, sympathetically, and this Prime Directive is followed here, though the focus is on Capote's unraveling.The film is masterfully made on every level, and the problem is that you are always aware of it. Adam Kimmel's cinematography is like a series of exquisite photographs in an autumnal palette of gold, yellow, rust, and black. Dan Futterman's screenplay is brilliant, witty, and so controlled it's almost anal-retentive. The acting is subtle and superb down to each individual prison guard. Yet I was never able to live in this movie or feel for the characters.A big stumbling block was Philip Seymour Hoffman's tour de force as Truman Capote. Possibly this won't be a problem for younger viewers, who don't have indelible memories of the real Capote on Johnny Carson. Hoffman inhabits Capote with ferocious fidelity. He has Capote down to every quiver of the lip, every fey swish of the hand, every self-satisfied snicker. I wanted to feel Capote's torment as his love for Perry Smith battled with his need to have the man die so that Capote could finish his book, but I couldn't feel anything because I was so busy being amazed by Hoffman's exquisite acting. The same was true for Clifton Collins Jr.'s Perry--I could hear the wheels turning each time he lifted his chin or made his mouth tremble. Chris Cooper and Catherine Keener were exceptions, both natural and unaffected. Speaking of Catherine Keener I got a kick out of seeing that Harper Lee was a cigarette-smoking, sharp-tongued cookie. I'd always imagined the author of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" as a starched old Southern lady.On the DVD docs, director Bennett Miller and cinematographer Adam Kimmel remember waiting hours for a distant freight train to bisect the bleak Kansas plain so they could get a moody shot. They got lots of moody shots--wheat waving, the Clutter house exterior, looming storm clouds--and didn't cut one of them. It isn't enough that Truman looks with wonderment at Perry, he looks endlessly. The scenes are all brief--sometimes just a reaction beat--but everyone seems to be moving through Jell-O.

967014,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000E33VWW,RMurray847,"[3, 7]","First and foremost, this film is anchored by the brilliant performance of Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I know many others have said the same thing, but this performance MUST get an Oscar nomination. It seems highly unlikely that there will be a better lead performance this year. This is a riveting, intelligent movie...but would be completely sunk without a great performance. Truman Capote was an odd man...and his mannerisms and voice would have been easy to turn into caricature...Hoffman makes him as real and believable as such a person could be.The movie surrounds the creation of the non-fiction novel IN COLD BLOOD, about a brutal murder of a family in a small farming community. For 1959, it was particularly brutal (although while watching the film, I couldn't help thinking that if the same happened today, it might not even make the national news), and Capote initially sets out to write an article about the effects of the killings on the community. But he's first drawn in by the crimes and a fascination with the brutality. (He even peeks in on the closed caskets to discover that the faces of the victims have been swaddled in cotton because they were so badly damaged by the shotgun blasts.) He wins the reluctant trust of the head law enforcement official (Chris Cooper) and the story begins to take shape. But when the perpetrators are caught, and Capote attends the perp walk, he is instantly drawn to one suspect, Perry King. He finagles a meeting with King and discovers a soft-spoken, highly intelligent soul, in some ways a kindred spirit. Capote is also gay, and the film hints that there might have been a physical attraction to Perry, but it never asserts this as a primary motivator...which is good, because there is no real historical evidence for this, and it would have cheapened this highly textured and layered movie.Capote is a man torn apart by conflicting feelings. He misses his lover back home (well-played by a gently aging Bruce Greenwood) but he begins to feel at home in the small town. His manner of dressing even begins to tone down for the ""local folk."" He is horrified by the crime, but drawn to King. He also senses that he has the makings of a groundbreaking book. King and his partner are quickly tried and sentenced to death...before Capote can get all he needs from King. So he arranges high-priced legal help for the men, just to draw out the process. Naturally, King is grateful for the friendship. But is Capote really a friend? Or is he just a selfish man? The movie has it both ways...which is its strength. At no time does it settle for easy answers or clich&eacute;d feelings. Hoffman is compelled again and again to depict a man who doesn't clearly know his own heart...or doesn't want to face it. He runs for months at a time, but is pulled in again and again. Hoffman handles these challenges brilliantly. Frankly, I doubt there is another film actor working right now capable of executing this role. I can't even imagine who else the director might have had in mind for the part.Another key role (an another Oscar nomination, one can hope) is the character of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD author Harper Lee, played by Catherine Keener, one of the best actresses around. At first, she is simply his lifelong friend and now his ""research assistant."" They travel to the crime scene together and she helps Truman seem a little more normal. But halfway through the film, her book is published, and she becomes the most celebrated writer in America. Capote is torn apart by jealousy. It's an unattractive side to him, and there is a brief but lovely scene when Lee recognizes how torn up Capote is, and instead of confronting her old friend (and believe me, she isn't one to necessarily spare his feelings), she offers a brief moment of comfort. Her understanding allows us to know just deeply Capote has gone off his tracks at this point.Towards the end of the film, all the appeals run out for the two condemned men, and there are some death row and execution scenes that are downright chilling. We don't feel bad that the men are sentenced to die, but the quietness of the scenes is very effective. Yes, executions make almost naturally compelling drama, but the filmmakers have gone above and beyond. These are not glossy scenes (a la THE GREEN MILE or DEAD MAN WALKING); they are dusty, grim and heart pounding. The young actor Clifton Collins Jr, who plays Perry, does a terrific job throughout, but he shines in these scenes. Never over the top, we nonetheless get a sense of the terror and resignation he is feeling. And we can get a pretty good idea of why Capote's career descended into booze and ineffectuality after these events.The movie is not flawless. Although it's less than two hours, the pace is just a little slack and indulgent, and the movie feels just a little bit too long. While the movie does a terrific job in art direction (it feels beautifully of the late `50s and early `60s), the cinematography seemed a bit obvious at times. The same establishing show of New York City was used over and over...I assume some of this was budget limitations, but it's a flaw nonetheless. But these are minor flaws. What the film DOES have going for it is a terrific script, a compelling story, and a fistful of textured, highly intelligent performances. I highly recommend this film...one of the best of 2005.",5,Simply one of the best of 2005!!,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,5368,"['First', 'foremost', 'film', 'anchored', 'brilliant', 'performance',

967015,A3TWJ2NZYBMJYL,B000E33VWW,"Robert J. McCallum ""robmccal""","[1, 1]","It is remarkable that two movies about Truman Capote and both dealing with the same subtext -- the writing of ""In Cold Blood"" -- were made within a year of each other.  ""Capote,"" released in 2005, is the better-known film with Philip Seymour Hoffman justifiably winning an Oscar as best actor.  But ""Infamous"" (2006) is just as compelling and dare I say it, Toby Jones is just as good as Hoffman in the title role -- now that's really remarkable!  Just as important are the supporting roles in both films.  The two Harper Lees -- Catherine Keener in ""Capote"" and Sandra Bullock in ""Infamous"" -- are equally good as are the two Perry Smiths -- Clifton Collins, Jr. in the former and Daniel Craig in the latter film (can this really be the same actor as the super elegant James Bond in the latest Bond film, ""Casino Royale""?). Clearly, being the second film released, ""Infamous"" was generally overlooked despite an all-star cast which included Jeff Daniels, SigourneyWeaver, Isabella Rossellini, Peter Bogdanovich, and Gwyneth Paltrow (in a small cameo role).  On the other hand, ""Capote"" has the always superb Chris Cooper in a critical supporting role.If you are a fan of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" it is facinating to see Harper Lee as portrayed in these two films and reflect on how Dill could grow up to be Capote.  In conclusion I can only suggest that you see both films, they both deserve it!After seeing one or both films I would hope that you would read (or reread) ""In Cold Blood"" or see the 1967 film adaptation (with the star remaking turn by Robert Blake as Perry) or do both.  No matter what you think about capital punishment, you will rethink your views after reading or seeing these works of art.An aside: the only other example I can think of where an Academy Award-winning actor had a contemporary play the same character in different movies is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence of the Lambs"" and Brian Cox in ""Manhunter"" based on Thomas Harris' novel ""Red Dragon.""

967016,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000E33VWW,Robert Moore,"[3, 5]","Somerset Maugham liked to characterize himself as a good writer of the second rank.  Much the same can be said of Truman Capote, with the caveat that he wrote one book of the first rank, his astonishing nonfiction novel IN COLD BLOOD.  This marvelous film tells the story of the writing of that book and reiterates the theory of one of Capote's most prominent biographers that the writing of that book was not merely the culmination of his career, but the cause of his decline as a writer and his descent into alcoholism.  The past few years has seen an explosion of biopics, but by any standard this has to stand as one of the very finest, and perhaps even the best.Whatever other merits this film has-and it has many-first and foremost is the incarnation of Truman Capote in the performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Almost every year going into Oscar season we see at least one performance that so completely overwhelms all of the others it seems inconceivable that that performance will not win the Oscar.  Last year that performance was Imelda Staunton in VERA DRAKE.  This year that performance is Hoffman in CAPOTE.  No performance in 2005 by either a male or female came anywhere near the job that Hoffman did here.  What is astonishing is not merely that Hoffman did such a magnificent job of imitating Capote's voice and mannerisms that he seems to be channeling rather than impersonating him but that within that imitation he delivered a performance of enormous subtlety and emotional range.  In other words, this performance truly is more about acting than about imitation, though the imitation is impeccable, despite the fact that Hoffman is far too tall for the role (but, then, Peter O'Toole was about a foot too tall to play the diminutive T. E. Lawrence in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA).  Hoffman's performance is so dominating and so remarkable that it alone would have been sufficient to guarantee the film's success, but luckily he is far from the only good thing in the film.This film, which has been widely reported as having been shot in slightly more than a month, is remarkable on almost every level.  The period look is impeccable from the dress to the d&eacute;cor of rooms.  Every aspect of the production is first rate, but what really shines is the superb cast, which is populated with a host of great character actors.  Apart from Hoffman no one performer stands out, but that is more a testimony to the overall excellence of the cast than the failure of any actor.  Chris Cooper, Catherine Keener (a great beauty who glams down in this one as Capote's close friend Harper Lee-the odd kid in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was modeled on Lee's childhood friend Truman--showing that she is going in middle age going to be one of our most versatile actresses), Bruce Greenwood (as Jack Dunphy), Bob Balaban, and Mark Pellegrino all perform marvelously in a very strong cast.  Clifton Collins Jr., an actor I previously knew only from several appearances on the television show ALIAS, was very good in the key role of Perry Smith, one of the two murderers with whom Capote somewhat identified and who he both befriended and exploited in writing his book.The story, of course, revolves around Capote's investigation of the horrific murder of a well liked and important family in a small town in Kansas.  Each of the victims had been bound and shot in the head with a shot gun.  After a police hunt two young men, Perry Smith and Richard Hickcock, were arrested for the crime.  They were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death.  During the proceedings Capote, who was covering the murders for the New Yorker, befriended Smith, who has a background similar to Capote's own.  The film is superb at showing the complexity of human motivation, how Capote both truly likes Smith and yet exploits him shamelessly while also being repulsed by him.  The cold-blooded manner in which Capote both exhibits tremendous compassion for Smith and lies to him about the state of his book is almost as scary as the murder that Smith commits in flashback.  Smith repeatedly asks Capote about how much he has written and what the title of the book will be and is told that he has made little progress on his untitled work.  In fact, Capote has nearly finished the book, largely waiting to find out whether Smith and Hickcock will succeed on their appeals of their death sentence, and very early on settled on the title.  A mark of how good the movie is comes when how tortured Capote is shown to be by his exploitation of Smith.  At the end his guilt drives him to agree to witness Smith's hanging.  The story from beginning to end is both riveting and horrifying.  I kept thinking of how the title of Capote's great book could be applied to almost every aspect of the entire story.I would highly recommend anyone who has seen this film but has not yet read IN COLD BLOOD to do so as soon as possible.  This truly is one of the most marvelously written books in the past half century.  The prose is as exquisite as any written in English during that period, with the nightmarish, harrowing murders portrayed as coldly and dispassionately as they were committed.  Throughout Capote distances himself from his subject matter and although to any attentive reader it becomes obvious that he has inside knowledge of many of the events in the book, he does not appear in any guise whatsoever.  If one knows nothing about Capote's involvement with Smith and Hickcock, as I did when I first read the book, it is clear that at the very least he conducted extensive interviews with everyone associated with the case.  Knowing how deeply involved Capote actually was makes his utter absence in the book especially eery.  IN COLD BLOOD is one of the finest American books of the past century and this fine film will hopefully be watched in conjunction with it in the future.  I will close by adding that while IN COLD BLOOD was made into a superb film (starring Robert Blake as Perry Smith), I think CAPOTE is an even better film.  I cannot recommend either the book or the movie more highly.",5,A fine film dominated by an absolutely stunning central performance,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,6075,"['Somerset', 'Maugham', 'liked',

967018,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000E33VWW,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","****1/2With his trademark curling lisp, high-pitched, squeaky voice and flamboyant mannerisms, it would have been easy for almost any actor to build a portrayal of Truman Capote on a foundation of studied mimicry and impersonation alone.  But in ""Capote,"" Phillip Seymour Hoffman goes far beyond surface recreation, plumbing the core of the inner man and bringing him to palpable life on the screen.  Most eloquent in his silences, Hoffman mesmerizes us with his performance.Based on a book by Gerald Clarke, ""Capote"" deals with the period in which the author struggled through to create his literary masterpiece, ""In Cold Blood,"" a book he claimed as the beginning of a whole new genre of writing, the ""nonfiction novel.""  In November 1959, a family of four was brutally slaughtered in their Kansas farmhouse by two drifters in search of cash, Richard Hickock and Perry Smith.  Capote, a successful writer and bon vivant of the literati set in Manhattan, found himself drawn to the case, venturing to the heart of the country with his lifelong friend, Harper Lee (author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""), to interview the accused killers and try to make some sense of the whole thing.  The screenplay by Dan Futterman zeroes in with stiletto-like precision on the complex relationship that develops between Capote and Perry, the more ""sensitive"" of the two killers.  Capote is drawn to this man in so powerful a fashion that even he is unable to figure out exactly why.  Is it because he senses something in Perry's past that reminds him of his own (both suffered from abandonment issues), thus creating a sort of kinship between them?  Is he attracted to Perry sexually and romantically?  Or is he being subtly manipulated by an evil man who senses in this author a weakness and vulnerability he can exploit for his own nefarious purposes?It is a tribute to the complexity of the filmmaking that we feel that none of these and all of these possibilities may be true simultaneously.  And what is so great about Hoffman's performance is that he builds on this ambiguity.  We are never entirely sure if Capote truly cares for Perry or if he is merely using him to get what he needs for the book.  And the way Hoffman plays him, Capote never seems quite sure either.  He is obviously drawn to Perry with a sort of grim fascination, as anyone might be who encounters a person whose actions are as inexplicable and yet larger-than-life as Perry`s.  But when it all becomes too much for Capote and he begins to ignore Perry`s demands for attention, is he doing so out of indifference or disgust at himself for being so drawn to this person in the first place?  Is this fascination with Perry revealing dark truths about Capote that the man himself is unwilling or unable to acknowledge?  The film never answers those questions - as well it shouldn`t.Clifton Collins Jr. is also very powerful as Perry, providing the sensitivity and charisma the character needs to make the story convincing.  In a rich performance as Harper Lee, Catherine Keener serves as the moral center of gravity to which Capote must continually return in order to finish his work and maintain his grip on reality.In his first non-documentary film, Bennett Miller demonstrates remarkable control as a director.  His spare filmmaking style perfectly reflects not only the harsh Midwest setting but the chamber-like drama that is unfolding within it.  It is a very ""interior"" film, and Miller is not afraid to linger long on his scenes, allowing the actors free rein in establishing their rhythms and building the drama.Although come Oscar night, I will be rooting for Heath Ledger to take home the trophy (I believe his performance in ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the high point of acting in recent times), I will certainly understand it if the Academy chooses to honor Hoffman's work here instead.  It would definitely be my second choice.",4,compelling psychological insight into the author,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,3895,"['****1/2With', 'trademark', 'curling', 'lisp', 'high-pitched', 'squeaky', 'voice', 'flamboyant', 'mannerisms', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'almost', 'actor', 'build', 'portrayal', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'foundation', 'studied', 'mimicry', 'impersonation', 'alone', 'Capote', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'far', 'surface', 'recreation', 'plumbing', 'core', 'inner', 'man', 'bringing', 'palpable', 'life', 'screen', 'Most', 'eloquent', 'silences', 'Hoffman', 'performance.Based', 'book', 'Gerald', 'Clarke', 'Capote', 'deals', 'period', 'author', 'struggled', 'create', 'literary', 'masterpiece', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'book', 'claimed', 'beginning', 'whole', 'new', 'genre', 'writing', 'nonfiction', 'novel', 'November', '1959', 'family', 'four', 'was', 'brutally', 'slaughtered', 'Kansas', 'farmhouse', 'two', 'drifters', 'search', 'cash', 'Richard', 'Hickock', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'successful', 'writer', 'bon', 'vivant', 'literati', 'set', 'Manhattan', 'found', 'drawn', 'case', 'venturing', 'heart', 'country', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'author', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'interview', 'accused', 'killers', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'whole', 'thing', 'screenplay', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'stiletto-like', 'precision', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Capote', 'Perry', 'more', 'sensitive', 'two', 'killers', 'Capote', 'drawn', 'man', 'so', 'powerful', 'fashion', 'even', 'unable', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'why', 'something', 'Perry', 'past', 'own', 'suffered', 'abandonment', 'issues', 'thus', 'creating', 'sort', 'kinship', 'attracted', 'Perry', 'sexually', 'romantically', 'being', 'subtly', 'manipulated', 'evil', 'man', 'who', 'author', 'weakness', 'vulnerability', 'can', 'exploit', 'own', 'nefarious', 'purposes', 'tribute', 'complexity', 'filmmaking', 'feel', 'none', 'possibilities', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'simultaneously', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'ambiguity', 'are', 'never', 'entirely', 'sure', 'Capote', 'truly', 'Perry', 'merely', 'using', 'get', 'what', 'book', 'way', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'either', 'obviously', 'drawn', 'Perry', 'sort', 'grim', 'fascination', 'anyone', 'might', 'be', 'who', 'person', 'actions', 'are', 'inexplicable', 'yet', 'larger-than-life', 'Perry', 's', 'when', 'too', 'much', 'Capote', 'ignore', 'Perry', 's', 'demands', 'attention', 'doing', 'so', 'indifference', 'disgust', 'being', 'so', 'drawn', 'person', 'first', 'place', 'fascination', 'Perry', 'revealing', 'dark', 'truths', 'Capote', 'man', 'unwilling', 'unable', 'acknowledge', 'film', 'never', 'answers', 'questions', 'as', 'well', 't.Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'also', 'very', 'powerful', 'Perry', 'providing', 'sensitivity', 'charisma', 'character', 'make', 'story', 'convincing', 'rich', 'performance', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'moral', 'center', 'gravity', 'Capote', 'must', 'continually', 'return', 'order', 'finish', 'work', 'maintain', 'grip', 'reality.In', 'first', 'non-documentary', 'film', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'remarkable', 'control', 'director', 'spare', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'perfectly', 'not', 'only', 'harsh', 'Midwest', 'setting', 'chamber-like', 'drama', 'unfolding', 'very', 'interior', 'film', 'Miller', 'not', 'afraid', 'linger', 'long', 'scenes', 'allowing', 'actors', 'free', 'rein', 'establishing', 'rhythms', 'building', 'drama.Although', 'come', 'Oscar', 'night', 'will', 'be', 'rooting', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'take', 'home', 'trophy', 'believe', 'performance', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'high', 'point', 'acting', 'recent', 'times', 'will', 'certainly', 'understand', 'Academy', 'honor', 'Hoffman', 'work', 'here', 'instead', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'second', 'choice']",N/A
967019,A387BD735MI50R,B000E33VWW,R. Schultz,"[3, 6]","This movie wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Yes, great acting. Yes, great scenery showing a sweeping, isolating emptiness up to the Clutter door. But I don't think the film sufficiently got into the spirit of the 1950's-60's, or of Truman Capote.I grew up listening to Capote on the talk show/interview circuit, and he almost always came off a lot more interesting than he did here. Based on the anecdotes the writers of this film have him recite, it's difficult to see why the New York literati would flock around him, enrapt, adoring.His little jest on the train - paying a porter to praise his writing in front of Harper lee - also comes off as a flat, unconvincing version of anything the real Capote might have done.Another jarring anachronism threads its way through the film. The lines ascribed to many of the characters involve their asserting their ""need"" to do something. ""I need to talk to him now."" ""I need to see them."" My objection to the heavy use of the word ""need"" as this verb appendage is not just a quibble. It's a fairly recent usage that has come to pervade our sense of ourselves. He now routinely present ourselves as individuals riddled with Swiss cheese holes. We stand in constant requirement of packages of social services and products to be delivered to us to fill the voids. We have left the more vital, commanding, ""I want"" and ""I have to"" for the precincts of this limp, pass-the-buck neediness. It's the sort of mindset cliche that Capote would probably have rebelled against and would have been unlikely to tolerate in the literary people around him.More important though, I think the film fails in its main mission of examining Capote's motives for alternately befriending, then abandoning, the two convicted killers. In the movie itself, Capote only once alludes to his conflicted state - in a few alcohol-drenched lines that are barely understandable. I had to rely on surrounding commentary about the film to gather that it was trying to portray Capote's unreliable helpfulness as being rooted in the two diametrically opposed motives with which he approached the killers. On the one hand, he liked them (especially Perry Smith). He saw his history as being the obverse side of there troubled passage through life. On the other hand, so it's said, he needed to have them executed in order to get a rounded, dramatic conclusion for his book, ""In Cold Blood.""However, I doubt that this set of at-odds purposes was really Capote's hanging point (pardon pun). He could have finished his book, brought it to some meaningful resolution, without an actual execution. Whatever he may have told himself, a bigger reason for his waffling probably lay more in his chronic inertia, his addiction to letting the real work of writing slide in favor of all sorts of light indulgences and passing fancies. And that's the sort of tragic conflict that affects so many of us. We betray friendships and let our talents waste because of an abiding laziness.I suspect that was why Capote never completed another major work after ""In Cold Blood."" It was inertia, rather than the haunting loss of Smith and Hickock.So while I recommend ""Capote,"" still, it left me longing for something more. I felt myself craning around the corner of it to hear what might come from Other Voices, Other Rooms (suggested by the title of Capote's first published work).If you want a fuller, likelier, more universally profound look into the tragedy of Capote, get hold of a video copy of Robert Morse's performance as ""Tru.""",3,Doesn't Ring Tru,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,3526,"['movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'expected', 'be', 'Yes', 'great', 'acting', 'Yes', 'great', 'scenery', 'showing', 'sweeping', 'isolating', 'emptiness', 'up', 'Clutter', 'door', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'sufficiently', 'got', 'spirit', ""1950's-60"", 'Truman', 'Capote.I', 'grew', 'up', 'listening', 'Capote', 'talk', 'show/interview', 'circuit', 'almost', 'always', 'came', 'off', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'did', 'here', 'Based', 'anecdotes', 'writers', 'film', 'have', 'recite', 'difficult', 'see', 'why', 'New', 'York', 'literati', 'would', 'flock', 'enrapt', 'adoring.His', 'little', 'jest', 'train', 'paying', 'porter', 'praise', 'writing', 'front', 'Harper', 'lee', 'also', 'off', 'flat', 'unconvincing', 'version', 'anything', 'real', 'Capote', 'might', 'have', 'jarring', 'anachronism', 'threads', 'way', 'film', 'lines', 'ascribed', 'many', 'characters', 'involve', 'asserting', 'need', 'do', 'something', 'need', 'talk', 'now', 'need', 'see', 'objection', 'heavy', 'use', 'word', 'need', 'verb', 'appendage', 'not', 'just', 'quibble', 'fairly', 'recent', 'usage', 'come', 'pervade', 'sense', 'ourselves', 'now', 'routinely', 'present', 'individuals', 'riddled', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'holes', 'stand', 'constant', 'requirement', 'packages', 'social', 'services', 'products', 'be', 'delivered', 'fill', 'voids', 'have', 'left', 'more', 'vital', 'commanding', 'want', 'have', 'precincts', 'limp', 'pass-the-buck', 'neediness', 'sort', 'mindset', 'cliche', 'Capote', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'rebelled', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unlikely', 'tolerate', 'literary', 'people', 'him.More', 'important', 'think', 'film', 'main', 'mission', 'examining', 'Capote', 'motives', 'alternately', 'befriending', 'then', 'abandoning', 'two', 'convicted', 'killers', 'movie', 'Capote', 'only', 'once', 'alludes', 'conflicted', 'state', 'few', 'alcohol-drenched', 'lines', 'are', 'barely', 'understandable', 'had', 'rely', 'surrounding', 'commentary', 'film', 'gather', 'was', 'trying', 'portray', 'Capote', 'unreliable', 'helpfulness', 'being', 'rooted', 'two', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'motives', 'approached', 'killers', 'one', 'hand', 'liked', 'especially', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'saw', 'history', 'being', 'obverse', 'side', 'troubled', 'passage', 'life', 'other', 'hand', 'said', 'needed', 'have', 'executed', 'order', 'get', 'rounded', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'book', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'However', 'doubt', 'set', 'at-odds', 'purposes', 'was', 'really', 'Capote', 'hanging', 'point', 'pardon', 'pun', 'could', 'have', 'finished', 'book', 'brought', 'meaningful', 'resolution', 'actual', 'execution', 'may', 'have', 'told', 'bigger', 'reason', 'waffling', 'probably', 'lay', 'more', 'chronic', 'inertia', 'addiction', 'letting', 'real', 'work', 'writing', 'slide', 'favor', 'sorts', 'light', 'indulgences', 'passing', 'fancies', 'sort', 'tragic', 'conflict', 'so', 'many', 'betray', 'friendships', 'let', 'talents', 'waste', 'abiding', 'laziness.I', 'suspect', 'was', 'why', 'Capote', 'never', 'completed', 'major', 'work', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'was', 'inertia', 'rather', 'haunting', 'loss', 'Smith', 'Hickock.So', 'recommend', 'Capote', 'still', 'left', 'longing', 'something', 'more', 'felt', 'craning', 'corner', 'hear', 'what', 'might', 'come', 'Other', 'Voices', 'Other', 'Rooms', 'suggested', 'title', 'Capote', 'first', 'published', 'work', '.If', 'want', 'fuller', 'likelier', 'more', 'universally', 'profound', 'look', 'tragedy', 'Capote', 'get', 'hold', 'video', 'copy', 'Robert', 'Morse', 'performance', 'Tru']",N/A

Thought this was going to be boring, documentary-ish, not at all. As I love Philip Seymour Hoffman, and look forward to anything with him in it, we got the DVD and watched last night.My darling Norman fell asleep, and toddled off to bed halfway through, but not me! I stayed up till the wee hours to finish it. It held my interest, keep me captivated, and was fascinating to me.I'm assuming it is somewhat accurate, even though Mr. Capote is gone, the writers no doubt interviewed friends and family. The woman that played his assistant, was very very good. Charming and believable. I found it equally fascinating that she wrote the book ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""

967025,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000E33VWW,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 3]","""Capote"" is an excellent, disturbing analysis of darkness touring, at first unwittingly, then compulsively and destructively, the most pitiful district of its large precinct, running its hand over the contours of a neighborhood polar opposite to the martini Saturday nights in uptown Manhattan and finding it equally rife with desolation and ruthlessness. The uplift of it? There is no uplift. It is a straight, fierce double shot of grain liquor. Some artists grope around in the abyss, are pulled in, and do not fully return. Franz Kafka. Sam Peckinpah. Vincent Van Gogh. John Kennedy Toole. Jackson Pollock. And Truman Capote, who wrote harmless society novels and larks for The New Yorker before he stumbled upon an item in the New York Times about a murdered family in a west Kansas farmhouse.He would go there for a magazine piece. Six years later he would produce ""In Cold Blood,"" still a titan of non-fiction and the treadmill for the true-crime section genre, Court TV, the Amber Alert, all of it. Director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Dan Futterman don't rehash the book - Richard Brooks' 1967 film does that fine. Instead, they follow Capote as he researches, writes, gloats, abuses his subjects - convicted murderers Perry Smith and Richard Hickok - drinks, smokes, and generally dissolves from the pressure of his talent and conflicted guilt over the impending deaths of the killers. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Capote, covers the journey as if he was born to it, effortlessly channeling the man's charm, malice and tunnel ambition, not to mention his speech and mannerisms. By movie's end you loathe and pity Capote precisely because he has the capacity for scruples, and he pitches them.In his New York fishbowl Capote holds court. In Holcomb, Kan., where Smith and Hickok murdered the Clutter family, he uses his novelist friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) as a frontwoman into the homes of reluctant witnesses and police investigator Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper). It works. In these scenes Capote is his usual storytelling self on a four or five, and he is very good at working over regular folks with stories of Bogart and Marilyn. He changes the day Smith and Hickok are captured and he meets Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) in the kitchen of the sheriff's apartment, in the women's holding cell.""He's a goldmine,"" Capote tells his friend Lee of Smith, a shy, tortured soul taken to Capote as a dog to a benevolent master. And because of it, Capote fights to save both killers from the death penalty until he can convince Smith to talk about the night of the murders. Until their hanging would better serve the ending of his book. By the hour of their execution in a warehouse behind Leavenworth prison, Capote has slipped into a basket of acute alcoholism, self-aggrandizement and persecution complex. Most authors stretch recollected truth; Capote's predicament is worse that he is an integral part of the truth. The fact of his book and the lives of those in it reverse prioritiesThe movie has an elegant, unhurried construction toward the moment Capote sees his subjects for the last time just before midnight. Miller inserts scenes of the winter Kansas prairie for emotional effect and structural progress - a shot of a distant passenger train sliding along the plains echoes Terrence Malick - while his interiors are cloaked in shadows and dimly-lit, stripped of their vibrancy; save a short interlude at Capote's home in Spain, the director works in blacks, grays, hunter greens, washed-out prison blues.Hoffman's dandy aside, the performances suit the tone. Keener's Harper Lee is steady, sage and close to saintly; she emerges as a bit of a cipher for Miller and Futterman's analysis of the lead character; in most scenes it's hard to tell whether she's Capote's friend or his philosophical foil Likewise Bruce Greenwood as author Jack Dunphy, Capote's lover. Cooper, as Alvin Dewey, maintains that talent of holding contempt and affection in the same moment while Collins plays Smith as a man who seems like a perfectly unfortunate soul before and after the hour he shot four people in the head.",5,The Fall of Man...in the fall of a man,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,4122,"['Capote', 'excellent', 'disturbing', 'analysis', 'darkness', 'touring', 'first', 'unwittingly', 'then', 'compulsively', 'destructively', 'most', 'pitiful', 'district', 'large', 'precinct', 'running', 'hand', 'contours', 'neighborhood', 'polar', 'opposite', 'martini', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'uptown', 'Manhattan', 'finding', 'equally', 'desolation', 'ruthlessness', 'uplift', 'uplift', 'straight', 'fierce', 'double', 'shot', 'grain', 'liquor', 'artists', 'grope', 'abyss', 'are', 'pulled', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'return', 'Franz', 'Kafka', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'Toole', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'who', 'wrote', 'harmless', 'society', 'novels', 'larks', 'New', 'Yorker', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'item', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'murdered', 'family', 'west', 'Kansas', 'farmhouse.He', 'would', 'go', 'there', 'magazine', 'piece', 'Six', 'years', 'later', 'would', 'produce', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'still', 'titan', 'non-fiction', 'treadmill', 'true-crime', 'section', 'genre', 'Court', 'TV', 'Amber', 'Alert', 'Director', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'screenwriter', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'do', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'book', 'Richard', 'Brooks', '1967', 'film', 'fine', 'Instead', 'follow', 'Capote', 'gloats', 'subjects', 'convicted', 'murderers', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Richard', 'Hickok', 'drinks', 'smokes', 'generally', 'dissolves', 'pressure', 'talent', 'conflicted', 'guilt', 'impending', 'deaths', 'killers', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'journey', 'was', 'born', 'effortlessly', 'channeling', 'man', 'charm', 'malice', 'tunnel', 'ambition', 'not', 'mention', 'speech', 'mannerisms', 'movie', 'end', 'loathe', 'pity', 'Capote', 'precisely', 'capacity', 'scruples', 'them.In', 'New', 'York', 'fishbowl', 'Capote', 'court', 'Holcomb', 'Kan.', 'where', 'Smith', 'Hickok', 'murdered', 'Clutter', 'family', 'novelist', 'friend', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'frontwoman', 'homes', 'reluctant', 'witnesses', 'police', 'investigator', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'scenes', 'Capote', 'usual', 'storytelling', 'self', 'four', 'five', 'very', 'good', 'working', 'regular', 'folks', 'stories', 'Bogart', 'Marilyn', 'day', 'Smith', 'Hickok', 'are', 'captured', 'Smith', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'kitchen', 'sheriff', 'apartment', 'women', 'holding', 'cell', 'goldmine', 'Capote', 'friend', 'Lee', 'Smith', 'shy', 'tortured', 'soul', 'taken', 'Capote', 'dog', 'benevolent', 'master', 'Capote', 'fights', 'save', 'killers', 'death', 'penalty', 'can', 'convince', 'Smith', 'talk', 'night', 'murders', 'hanging', 'would', 'better', 'serve', 'ending', 'book', 'hour', 'execution', 'warehouse', 'Leavenworth', 'prison', 'Capote', 'slipped', 'basket', 'acute', 'alcoholism', 'self-aggrandizement', 'persecution', 'complex', 'Most', 'authors', 'stretch', 'recollected', 'truth', 'Capote', 'predicament', 'worse', 'integral', 'part', 'truth', 'fact', 'book', 'lives', 'prioritiesThe', 'movie', 'elegant', 'unhurried', 'construction', 'moment', 'Capote', 'subjects', 'last', 'time', 'just', 'before', 'midnight', 'Miller', 'scenes', 'winter', 'Kansas', 'prairie', 'emotional', 'effect', 'structural', 'progress', 'shot', 'distant', 'passenger', 'train', 'sliding', 'plains', 'echoes', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'interiors', 'are', 'cloaked', 'shadows', 'dimly-lit', 'stripped', 'vibrancy', 'save', 'short', 'interlude', 'Capote', 'home', 'Spain', 'director', 'blacks', 'grays', 'hunter', 'greens', 'washed-out', 'prison', 'blues.Hoffman', 'dandy', 'aside', 'performances', 'suit', 'tone', 'Keener', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'steady', 'sage', 'close', 'saintly', 'bit', 'cipher', 'Miller', 'Futterman', 'analysis', 'lead', 'character', 'most', 'scenes', 'hard', 'tell', 'Capote', 'friend', 'philosophical', 'foil', 'Likewise', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'author', 'Jack', 'Dunphy', 'Capote', 'lover', 'Cooper', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'talent', 'holding', 'contempt', 'affection', 'same', 'moment', 'Collins', 'Smith', 'man', 'who', 'perfectly', 'unfortunate', 'soul', 'hour', 'shot', 'four', 'people', 'head']",N/A

967028,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000E33VWW,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 0]","Philip Seymour Hoffman has played a series of sarcastic buffoons and petty low-lifes (see his turns in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" ""Boogie Nights,"" and ""Scent of a Woman"") and has always been one of those actors whom you really want to see ""in the margins"" of a movie.  He was almost always surprisingly good in surprisingly enjoyable films, and his name appearing a few names below the stars' in the cast was almost a validation that the movie was worth your time.But with ""Capote,"" Hoffman cast aside whatever ""marginal"" status he may have had and has given one of the best on-screen performances in recent years.  The gifted writer, Truman Capote, was such a caricature of himself that he almost defies an actor's chance to ""play it straight,"" but somehow Hoffman manages to do so.  This is a performance for the ages - Hoffman has done something on a par with what Charlize Theron did with her masterful turn as the pathetic serial killer in ""Monster.""""Capote"" focuses on the six-year period where Truman Capote researched and wrote ""In Cold Blood,"" about the 1959 murder of the Clutter family in Holcolm, Kansas, and the ultimate execution of the two murderers, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith.  Capote was a semi-famous writer, with ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" under his belt, but Capote knew that he had not yet lived up to his own self-image (revealed in a wonderful scene where Nell Harper Lee, Capote's research assistant and future author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" deduces that the compliments being paid to Capote by a fan are the result of a Capote pay-off).""Capote"" keeps its focus on Truman, which is probably appropriate for an ego-maniac like him, but it comes at a cost to the story.  The only quibble I have is that virtually every supporting character in ""Capote"" is entirely static . . . some very talented actors are not given a second note to play, but are solid in their one-note roles.But in the movie's praise, it gets virtually everything else right.  Truman was the epitome of the self-centered writer, blissfully content to sip cocktails and be the center of attention in New York and to accept adulation, using his outlandish fashion sense to set himself apart (and, he thinks, above) the plain people of Kansas, and furious with anyone who interferes with his grasp of the spotlight -- as both Lee and Perry Smith learn to their chagrin.The movie also captures the torment writing ""In Cold Blood"" put Capote through, a uniquely Capote-esque kind of torture.  When Smith and Hickock are sentenced to death, Capote knows that he has an ending to his book. But the two murderers keep getting stays of execution, and Capote starts to whine that ""they are torturing me"" because he can't finish his book.  Virtually everyone around him sees this corruption of Capote's soul, but this master of insight can't see it in himself.  He only feels the pain, but cannot recognize its cause.A wonderful performance in a very good movie, Hoffman has likely done for Capote what George C. Scott did for General Patton - formed the defining image of a noteworthy character starting to get lost in the mists of time.

As William Shawn's sons have protested, the film's depiction of their father is completely imaginary (he didn't provide photographers, didn't arrange the reading, felt squeamish about the book); more important than that, Capote did not hire lawyers for Perry and Smith.  I don't know much about Harper Lee, but I find it hard to believe that she was as entirely angelic as this film requires her to be - requires, in order to recast a passage of history into a morality tale.  It's fair enough to do this, in general: any creation imposes a frame on its subject, and framing history will direct the way it is viewed; but I was uncomfortable with the mixture here of distortion and moralization.  The film-makers choose to show us nothing of the slaughtered family: that's a big point for Perry, who is left as the story's chief victim, and thus a point against Capote.  But the killers performed a truly disgusting, diabolical act (I think it is necessary to make this obvious point), and the idea that Capote should somehow have tried to save them is one that the film needs quite a lot of creative betrayal to push through.",3,On Thin Ice,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,1294,"['Given', 'Capote', 'out', 'attack', 'subject', 'act', 'creative', 'betrayal', 'something', 'problem', 'film', 'so', 'blatantly', 'truth', 'William', 'Shawn', 'sons', 'have', 'protested', 'film', 'depiction', 'father', 'completely', 'imaginary', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'photographers', 'did', ""n't"", 'arrange', 'reading', 'felt', 'squeamish', 'book', 'more', 'important', 'Capote', 'did', 'not', 'hire', 'lawyers', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'entirely', 'angelic', 'film', 'be', 'order', 'recast', 'passage', 'history', 'morality', 'tale', 'fair', 'enough', 'do', 'general', 'creation', 'frame', 'subject', 'framing', 'history', 'will', 'direct', 'way', 'viewed', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'mixture', 'here', 'distortion', 'moralization', 'film-makers', 'choose', 'show', 'nothing', 'slaughtered', 'family', 'big', 'point', 'Perry', 'who', 'left', 'story', 'chief', 'victim', 'thus', 'point', 'Capote', 'killers', 'performed', 'truly', 'disgusting', 'diabolical', 'act', 'think', 'necessary', 'make', 'obvious', 'point', 'idea', 'Capote', 'should', 'somehow', 'have', 'tried', 'save', 'one', 'film', 'lot', 'creative', 'betrayal', 'push', 'through']",N/A

The movie itself is as good as Hoffman's performance, Keener does a wonderful job as Truman's best friend Harper Lee, she is his sounding board.  Hoffman's is such a nuanced performance and it is so interesting to watch Capote get eaten up by his own ambition, you can see in Hoffman's face a man who knows deep down what an empty vessel he is, all he wants is fame and he will stoop to any level to receive it.  The scene at the end where Capote tearfully tells the killers as they are about to go to their death that he did all he could to save them, it is so sincere, yet at the same time sooo insincere, he's such a manipulator, I think even Capote believes it for a minute.

If you are a fan of Capote's ""In Cold Blood,""  you will not be disappointed in this behind-the-scenes type movie of how he came to write the book.Hoffman definitely deserved the Oscar for his adaption of Capote which was brilliant.  I only wish this movie would have explored a bit more of his feelings that the real Capote had for Smith, one of the convicted.  Imagine standing there having to watch someone you so deeply cared about being put to death.  Chilling!

967033,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B000E33VWW,Shashank Tripathi,"[4, 5]","I made the mistake, as it were, of having first seen ""Infamous"", which for some inadequately explored reason is a film about the exact same theme made only one year after Capote and its coveted statuettes. There is no doubt in my mind that had I seen Capote earlier, I would have enjoyed the way it brings a somewhat forgotten eccentric author to the fore of this generation's mind. I've devoured Capote's writings, and am especially a fan of his short stories -- there is no better or more succinct introduction to the American south, its lingo, its dailyness. He was quite the social butterfly and made no effort to hide it.That is why, as much as I am myself a vocal proponent of a relaxed sensitizing style of movie-making such as Bennett Miller's, I cannot help feeling that life of a man in the fast lane simply does not belong in a noirish glacial film such as this. It seems so punch-drunk on being important and creating atmosphere that it forgets to develop its characters. The last half hour or so is probably the most tedious reminder as we wait listlessly for extension after dull extension to the hanging of the 'cold blood'-ed murderer.For people truly interested in Capote, ""Infamous"" does a sharper and more eloquent job of infusing the kind of joie de vivre for which Truman Capote is known. Seymour Hoffman may have gotten the Oscar nods, but Toby Jones kicks b*tt -- pardon the expression given the context -- as the actual character; he even looks and lisps like him! The script is strewn with just the kind of jaunty wit that was his hallmark. But the biggest sucker punch of all comes from Daniel Craig, whose intensity is orders of magnitude more hard-hitting as the criminal who became the cynosure of Capote's famous last book ""In Cold Blood"".Taken on its own, I am sure ""Capote"" is quite a film, but ""Infamous"" towers over its award-winning predecessor in almost every department conceivable: pace, dialogue, acting. Its breadth of emotion is all the more staggering for the depth it achieves; it bares the soul of everyone involved. Go for the laughs and stay for the tears and come away with a sense of what is human and what is kind.

967034,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B000E33VWW,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","Philip Seymour Hoffman brings, while entirely displaying his mannerisms and enveloping his persona, Truman Capote to the screen.  A man that seems completely torn through the middle, wanting to write his newly self-named, ""non-fiction"" novel, and a man that just cannot seem to cut the ties with the macabre subject of the book, Capote is going on assignment for ""The New Yorker"" magazine.  After he reads a small article in the New York Times about what occurred in the heartland of America; Holcomb, Kansas - 1959, there has been a gruesome and tragic murder of a family of four.  The culprits are quickly apprehended and sentenced for their crimes by the brilliant FBI Agent, Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper).  Capote has asked his friend from childhood days, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), to be his assistant (esteemed writer of, ""To Kill a Mockingbird""), she believes in him, cares for him, even as he's losing himself entirely in this astounding look at the crimes and especially while seeking closure for himself to move forward from this most horrible massacre and hideous murderer, namely Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) with whom he becomes intrigued, and dimwitted accomplice, Mark Pelligrino (Dick Hickock).What I found so confusing about Truman Capote was his relationship that he begins with Perry Smith.  He feels that he is a very misunderstood man.  He manipulated mechanisms to have more time in writing, although I wasn't always sure it was for that purpose alone.  At one point Harper Lee queries Truman if he is falling in love with Smith to which she hears from Truman, 'we are basically the same person, he chose to leave by the back door and I by the front' (paraphrased).  Capote goes to such extremes as to pay for their first appeal to seemingly inquire, then write more of his masterful novel, ""In Cold Blood"", but it becomes obvious it is for going back and forth in conversation with the articulate and well spoken Perry.  From what I could take from this is that Capote was getting more and more obsessed with him and unable to not be drawn in and engaged by him.  I could see it physically and psychologically draining and turning around for Truman Capote.  He didn't relent even with Alvin Dewey warning not to help out the murderers nor hamper any due process of the two.As the audience, we are all shaken-up by Smith's words, the overtly gruesome murder scenes, the open detailed dialogue concerning it, and the funeral scenes.  These horrible images stayed with me.  Truman Capote is repelled as much as he is drawn in by, what he believes is, a vulnerable Perry Smith. They start a kind of cat and mouse type game between them.  What made me so uncomfortable was the vulnerability of Capote, whether real or artificial at first, which he used to enter the psyche of Perry Smith.  This crime was actually done by Smith?  This is what this intelligent and articulate man is capable of, and on a whim?  If so, why is Truman Capote so drawn to this person?  Therein lies the dichotomy of this once spirited, open man and writer, Truman, who turns completely into a tapped-out, vacant persona that cannot get above this occurrence, this man; the subject of his novel.Truman Capote becomes wildly famous with his novel, although withdrawn and spitefully drunk concerning Harper Lee's brilliant novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".  Going so far as to say at its screen opening, starring Gregory Peck, that he doesn't see 'what the fuss is all about'.  He becomes self-absorbed and the layers are stripped back and away from this once thriving writer.  Most know the ending, however life changing his relationship with Smith had been and how much the writing of his book cost Capote personally.  But why did this run so deep and what did take over Capote's mindset?Philip Seymour Hoffman is to be commended for the Academy Award winning work he did by totally circumscribing and bringing every minute detail of Truman Capote to life. Director Bennett Miller paints a frightening picture and an even steadier decline of his subject.  The scenes are basically eerie and dilapidated in Middle America (Adam Kimmel) screaming the gruesomeness that Capote is in the midst of.  He didn't really seem to desire the end of his writing, then afterwards he appeared totally lacking in any of the social graces he was so known for.  This movie does not glorify him, in fact, you may not like the man whatsoever, but it does show, with an uncomfortable feeling, just what he was going through during the writing of his most famous of books.  Capote became a truly tortured soul who was never again able to write another novel to fruition as he was so changed by the entire experience.At the time of writing this, I have been viewing everything that I can get my hands on of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  From his major roles, such as this, and everything else that I would call scene stealing portrayals or smaller parts in movies.  He truly will be missed.  My heart lurches with each movie I see when I view the dedication he brought to each and every role he portrayed.  We have really been given a wonderful actor; if only for this extremely short while.",5,"""This Is The Book I Was Always Meant To Write"" - Truman Capote",1401321600,"05 29,

Moreover, it made Truman Capote looked like a sad, pathetic, self inflated and manipulative journalist.Indeed, Capote spent six years of his life working on this masterpiece and it was one of the best books that I've ever read.

967036,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B000E33VWW,Sirin,"[3, 4]","Mid 1950s and Truman Capote was a well known writer in high society New York following the success of his novella Breakfast at Tiffany's. After that, as is well documented, a sighting of a small article in the New York times about a sinister, rural murder in a remote Kansas town led to bizzarre, captivating and emotionally tortuous events that created a masterpiece and ultimately broke the writer. This superlative movie tells that story.Capote, a man with a fragile ego and a gregarious desire to be entertaining, and be loved, travels to Kansas with his erstwhile friend Harper Lee (soon to have her own literary success with 'To Kill a Mockingbird). A measure of his vanity occurs in a scene on the train when he pays a porter to effusively praise his work in front of Harper. Initially, the locals are suspicious of this small, reedy voiced celebrity author, who claims to want to write an investigative report on the crime: 'it's from Bergadorf' Capote explains when he sees a policeman staring at his lavish scarf. However he ingratiates himself, first with the head investigator, and then the two murderers themselves - especially Perry Smith, who Capote develops a quasi-erotic bond with and discovers he shares a number of traits with his own background: 'I sometimes feel like we grew up in the same house, he went out the back door, while I went out the front,' Capote explains when asked if he has fallen in love with Perry Smith. Describing Smith as a 'goldmine', Capote arranges for a lawyer to defer their sentence so he can visit the men in jail, getting them to relinquish notebooks and reveal their story, piecemeal, so Capote can write what he forsees will be the book of the decade - a completely new genre, the non-fiction novel. Over the next months Capote divides his time between two completely different sides of America: the dark netherworld of lonely Kansas, where the men languish in a grim jail, and the bright lights of Manhattan, where his readings of early drafts of his book - titled 'In Cold Blood' are greeted with standing ovations from the literati. Capote develops a great bond and affinity with Smith, but knows that to publish his masterpiece, he must be executed. Masterfully, and cynically, like the smiler with the knife, he gets Smith to declare his version of the events of the November 1966 murder, while at the same time denying that the title really is 'In Cold Blood' - a title which neatly encapsulates Capote's dilemma, as well as the killers' motivations. As the film develops, the ego and talent - both genius and monstrous - of Capote is revealed. He dangles the promise of further legal help to Smith so he can continue writing the story, but knows all along that this will be ultimately relinquished. He is so wrapped up in his own issues that he cannot bring himself to congratulate Harper Lee on the launch of Mockingbird, and when he faces the harnessed killers about to be executed, he still sees himself as centre stage: 'I can't imagine what you men must think of me' - 'You haven't been foremost in my mind recently' replies Richard Hickcock, Smith's accomplice. Capote pulls it off - the masterpiece gets written, but the price was paid. As the end credits confirm, he was finished - as a writer, as a man.

It follows him as he befriends one of the killers of a horrible murder and gains his trust to get information for the book. Capote (the man) comes across as narcissistic, egotistical and manipulative and yet you can't help but also find him at times both charming and funny. The film also looks at his friendship with Harper Lee and how they supported one another's literary careers. Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves every accolade he received for this film and his performance is spell binding, you are truly riveted by his every look and inflection. You may not have the most respect for Capote by the end of this film, but as far as bio-pics go this one is outstanding. If you've read `In Cold Blood' then this makes for interesting and relevant viewing and if not then I highly recommend you do so, it is an incredible piece of writing and puts this film in greater context.

The story, as told from Capote's point of view (or was it Lee's?)is intriguing in it's objectivity, and the love/obsession that developes between Capote and Perry, that over years finishes/destroys Capote's career (and Capote himself) was prev unknown to me; in fact the whole history, except for the book itself, ICB, was new stuff to me.  I guess I'm not terribly informed, but was really surprised to find out later that Capote was the little ""Prettiest Baby in Town"" contest winner, from To Kill a Mockingbird, and that the little girl, the narrator and daughter of Atticus Finch of TKAM was in fact Harper Lee.  These facts put the story together in a tangible, tho indescribable way.

967039,A114YQ7ZT9Y1W5,B000E33VWW,Steiner,"[3, 4]","Bennett Miller's biopic about author Truman Capote and based on the Arthur Clarke biography of the same name. The film focuses on Capote's time spent researching the killing of a family in Kansas at the end of the 50's which would later be the subject of Capote's classic ""non-fiction"" novel In Cold Blood, which quickly rocketed the young writer to super-stardom. The film's structure is a bit perplexing; a film could easily be made from a number of segments in Capote's fascinating life and this version chooses to elaborate on the 10 years he spent on this particular work, which is essentially the middle of his life. This period certainly yields a lot of interesting material, yet I feel that those who have not read Clarke's biography may feel a little lost as there is very little context included. The most awesome facet of the film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's incredible impersonation of Capote; he managed to capture all of the complexity and vulnerability of Capote's character, and the film is very interesting in revealing how the young writer's efforts on this project may have ultimately destroyed him.The film is very engaging and often disturbing. However, a few inaccuracies are worth mentioning. The film seems to depict Capote as being uncaring and disinterested in Dick, the less intelligent of the two killers, yet the biography makes it clear that Capote devoted a great deal of attention to both killers as they awaited execution, despite his clear affection for Perry. Also, the film indicates that In Cold Blood's reception was universal acclaim; quite the contrary, many mainstream reviewers and writers such as Norman Mailer denied the book's literary merits. And thirdly, the title card at the end of the film states that In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in America (which is disputable), and that he never finished another book, which is blatantly false. Capote published Music for Chameleons in 1980, a collection of short stories clearly conceived as a complete book. Despite these problems, Capote is a very compelling film, and Hoffman's performance is one of his best yet.",4,Gripping,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,2132,"['Bennett', 'Miller', 'biopic', 'author', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'based', 'Arthur', 'Clarke', 'biography', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'Capote', 'time', 'spent', 'researching', 'killing', 'family', 'Kansas', 'end', '50', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'subject', 'Capote', 'classic', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'quickly', 'rocketed', 'young', 'writer', 'super-stardom', 'film', 'structure', 'bit', 'perplexing', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'made', 'number', 'segments', 'Capote', 'fascinating', 'life', 'version', 'elaborate', '10', 'years', 'spent', 'particular', 'work', 'essentially', 'middle', 'life', 'period', 'certainly', 'lot', 'interesting', 'material', 'feel', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Clarke', 'biography', 'may', 'feel', 'little', 'lost', 'very', 'little', 'context', 'included', 'most', 'awesome', 'facet', 'film', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'incredible', 'impersonation', 'Capote', 'managed', 'capture', 'complexity', 'vulnerability', 'Capote', 'character', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'revealing', 'how', 'young', 'writer', 'efforts', 'project', 'may', 'have', 'ultimately', 'destroyed', 'him.The', 'film', 'very', 'engaging', 'often', 'disturbing', 'However', 'few', 'inaccuracies', 'are', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'film', 'depict', 'Capote', 'being', 'uncaring', 'disinterested', 'Dick', 'less', 'intelligent', 'two', 'killers', 'yet', 'biography', 'clear', 'Capote', 'devoted', 'great', 'deal', 'attention', 'killers', 'awaited', 'execution', 'clear', 'affection', 'Perry', 'Also', 'film', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'reception', 'was', 'universal', 'acclaim', 'contrary', 'many', 'mainstream', 'reviewers', 'writers', 'such', 'Norman', 'Mailer', 'denied', 'book', 'literary', 'merits', 'thirdly', 'title', 'card', 'end', 'film', 'states', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'made', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'most', 'famous', 'writer', 'America', 'disputable', 'never', 'finished', 'book', 'blatantly', 'false', 'Capote', 'published', 'Music', 'Chameleons', '1980', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'clearly', 'conceived', 'complete', 'book', 'problems', 'Capote', 'very', 'compelling', 'film', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'yet']",N/A
967040,ABVULUZ2ILKKO,B000E33VWW,Stephen Ressel,"[0, 0]","This movie... was frightening.  Not so much because of the murders it depicts or the events leading to a conclusion, but rather it becomes a horrific look at how destiny lead a man to greatness and simultaneously dissolution.  Truman Capote was one of America's finest authors in his day.  He desirously rushes into the trap of creative epiphany only to have himself shattered as he faces himself as he relates to two murderers caught, convicted, and set to die.  All the while Truman is writing his masterpiece on their undead bodies.Amazing subject matter.Amazing performances.Technically masterful.In terms of pacing and story, an utter disaster.  If film is a visual language, this was a run-on sentence until about 2/3rd through.  It's slow and laborious without any relation to what is connecting characters together or the central plot to the characters.  Words are said, sure, but the shot choice and editing of the scenes and choice of dialog stifles the story.  Finally Capote gets the gem he searches for: the descriptive confession of the murder, and the film comes together and rockets to an ending where the viewer grips the chair arm as the movie's situation grips the viewer.Philip Seymour Hoffman could play a mute in a potato sack on a toilet behind a locked door for two hours and he'd fascinate an audience.  The rest of the cast were excellent.  Pity the film had so much going for it and was so easily defeated by editing of script and film, but with a film dealing with such deep issues framed with such a simple rung of events, every shot, every word, every creative choice has to be close to perfect for the film to thrive.  It's still a great film, but definitely not for a matinee audience, and can only be enjoyed by the older, artsier, or more intellectual crowd.

In 2004, Jimmie Fox got the award of playing Ray Charles, and now Philip Seymour Hoffman has won the award for his imiation of Turman Capote. So who will get the award this year for imating a person? Now before the movie came out, I had never heard of Truman Capote, but I have heard of the 1961 movie that was based of one of the few books that he wrote, and that is Breakfast at Tiffany's. And now for this month and next month, is what I think is the best time to watch this movie, Capote died on August 25th, 1984, and he was born on September 30, 1924. And last year this movie was relased on what would have been his 81st birthday, had he still been living today. Now I know that Capote had a very unusal voice, and I have heard that Hoffman gets it pretty right, but what is the deal with his voice? If I talked like that, I might have been mistaken for a woman. In fact, was he just a woman that wanted to be a man? The movie starts with a woman finding her uncle and aunt dead, in a murder that is a mystery, since the family died alone, with a person living to tell what exactly happened. Now we meet Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman), at some sort of event, lauging and enjoying being in the company of friends. And soon he hears of the event, or maybe more sees a story about it, and decides to write about it, and he calls New Yorker editor William Shawn (Bob Balaban), and lets him know of his next idea for a book. He heads for Kansas to dig up reseach for the book, and on the airplane he meets Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), who becomes his assiant, she also would write her own book, and she titled it To Kill a Mockbingbird, and I have heard of the movie version of th book, and now I have to wonder if I should spend more time reading, even through I don't really consider myself a bookworm, but I don't think her book that all matters here. Once he arrives in Kansas, he starts his research, interviewing surving famiy members, and meets the 2 men Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), who are held in a smale jail cell, and he forms a friendship with Perry Smith, and he takes in his request to have his side of the story held in a new trial, and promsises him to get him a new lawyer, he was senctended to death. There is also a lead investigator (Chris Cooper) and his wife (Amy Ryan). And even has Christmas sinner with them, when he gets a call that they got the 2 men they suspect that has to do with the killings.

967042,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000E33VWW,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[4, 5]","A well-deserved Oscar went to Phillip Seymour Hoffman for his wonderfully understated performance which in the hands of a lesser actor could easily have been reduced to a superficial, stereotypical, self-indulgent impersonation.  The story very slowly but delibertly unfolds in a casual relaxed manner against the backdrop of a vicious ""cold-blooded"" murder in the heartland of our country.  This is not only a great character study which includes more than that of just Capote's character.  The dynamics between Capote and the killers and with his childhood friend and moral compass Harper Lee, author ofTo Kill a Mockingbird, is nothing less than riveting.It's hard to say I ""enjoyed"" this film as it is very slow and deals with disturbing issues, but I highly recommend this film to be seen at least once.  Films should not be judged only upon what repeat value they may have.  Do try to note the lighter moments in movie.  I love the scene where the overtly feminine Capote, complete with ""flasher-like"" long coat attempts to question/interview some school kids.  Harper Lee quickly realizes this looks like the stereotypical pedofile asking, ""Hey, little boy.  You want some candy?"" and recommends that she question the kids and not Capote.  It's a pricelessly funny moment in an otherwise dark and disturbing film.FYI: For those of you who love trivia, Harper Lee included her childhood friend Capote in her novel as the character Dill, the young friend who spends every summer with the Finches.  The actor that played him in the film version was one of the early victims of AIDS.

For anyone who's ever read the book it should be obvious which of the two murderers he tried harder to understand, and this is the central relationship in a book about a man who has difficulty being truly sincere.

You worry about doing the film justice, giving the film its due, convincing other that this film is worthy.""Capote"" is a great film. I can't think of enough superlatives to do the film justice.November, 1959. Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) sits in his apartment reading through the New York Times and spots a short item about the murder of a family on a farm in Kansas. Something about the article speaks to Capote, he can write about this and turn it into a great article for the New Yorker. He enlists the aid of his friend, and fellow writer, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), as his research assistant for the trip. Upon their arrival in Kansas, they meet with Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the lead investigator in the case, haunted by images of the crime scene and determined to find the killers. Dewey's wife invites Capote and Lee to dinner, thrilled to have a celebrity in the house, beginning a friendship with the Dewey's which leads to them sharing Christmas dinner. The meal is interrupted by a call from Las Vegas. The suspects have been captured. Capote remains in the small town, hoping for the opportunity to interview Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino). When Capote meets Smith, he realizes that he has enough for a book. But he needs an ending. How and when will the book end?""Capote"", directed by Bennett Miller, written by Dan Futterman and produced by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, among others, is a great film. But I already said that, didn't I? See what I mean? It's difficult to do justice to a film like this.The most amazing thing about the film is Hoffman's portrayal of Capote. Before this film, my limited exposure to Capote has been his cameo in ""Murder by Death"" or various magazine pictures of him at parties throughout the Eighties. None of this gives you an idea of his life or his ability. The film, and Hoffman, quickly establish Capote's character. Enjoying success as a writer, and celebrity, he holds court during a party, recounting the story of another author telling him about his new book. This scene quickly establishes Capote's ego and his love of attention. After he finds the short newspaper article, we begin to see and sense many other layers to his character. He wants to be a great writer; as portrayed by Hoffman, we see that he valued celebrity as much as his skill. He wants to be in a loving relationship; his partner, author Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood) is working on a new novel and wants Capote to spend the holidays at home. Capote realizes that the research will take much longer and tries to assuage his lover about his absence. But the truly great thing about this performance is the relationship between Capote and Smith. Hoffman skillfully leads us to believe that Capote was attracted to Smith, helping him find lawyers, meeting with him for long periods of time. Was it all for the sake of a book, which Capote believed would be great? Or did he actually care about Smith? Or the Clutter family?As you watch Hoffman's performance you realize that there are many subtle contradictions in Capote's character. Hoffman brings these to life, in a completely disarming way. We feel like we are watching Capote in a documentary.Capote had a very stylized speech pattern and Hoffman captures it without stereotyping it or making light of it. It was simply how this man, who lived in many Southern communities growing up spoke.As far as I am concerned, the Oscar race for Best Actor is over. Hoffman should get the statue now. Forget about all of the campaigning. There may be other very good performances to come, but I doubt there will be another performance as good as Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote.All of the supporting performances are pitch perfect. Catherine Keener, once again, does a great job as she brings author Nelle Harper Lee to life. She and Capote had Southern roots and the desire to be great writers in common. Capote clearly liked to surround himself with talent, as friends and associates, and he recognized that Lee would be a great writer as well. During their research in Kansas, Lee learns that her book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" will be published. Over the course of writing ""In Cold Blood"", Lee's novel is published to great acclaim and made into a film starring Gregory Peck. Capote attends the New York premiere, but he is still so wrapped up in his own book that he can't come to terms with Lee's success, putting a strain on their relationship.Chris Cooper is outstanding as the tortured lawman. At one point, Capote helps Smith and Hickock find new lawyers. Dewey (Cooper) tells him that if he helps these two men get out of jail, he will personally come to Brooklyn and hunt Capote down.Clifton Collins, Jr. is also mesmerizing as Perry Smith. Collins has, frankly, never done anything this good. His last film of any note was ""Mindhunters"", the oft-delayed Renny Harlin mess released this summer. Collins manages to subtly convey that Smith may be just as manipulative as his new friend, Capote. He realizes early on that Capote needs him and once he gives Capote what he wants his new `friend' is gone. Throughout their relationship, they play a subtle game of cat and mouse.The beauty of the film is that it puts us in Capote's shoes. We experience all of the emotions that he experiences, see everything that he sees, and witness the events that he is present for. When he hears Smith's recount of the murders, he is visibly shaken, as are we, by the power of the words and images used.Rightfully, the film concentrates on Capote's life during the research and writing of ""In Cold Blood"". After the book was released, and acknowledged as a classic, Capote never really wrote anything that would earn him the attention or acclaim that he needed. It was essentially, the book he was meant to write and it would end his creative career. The rest of his life would be a shadow.""Capote"" does that rare thing. You learn about the man, his talent, and his life.",5,One Of The Year's Best...,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,6054,"['much', 'more', 'difficult', 'write', 'review', 'great', 'movie', 'worry', 'doing',

967055,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000E33VWW,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[2, 2]","Watching the slow moving pace of ""Capote"" made me marvel at how much modern film making depends on rapid cuts and digitized sweeps to mark passages. I haven't seen this many single camera shots in a film in years...and guess what? They make the movie hold its moral center. Despite the way many less aware viewers seem put off by Phillip Seymour Hoffman's affected speech patterns, anyone old enough to remember Truman Capote's legendary presence knows that THIS IS WHAT THE MAN WAS LIKE. So, as a bio-pic, Hoffman goes way beyond imitation into making understand who Capote was as a man.That is the true focus of the picture. Truman Capote wanted to find the topic that would make him a giant in the literary world, and he found it in the Clutter Family Murders in Kansas. You see him charm a small town of Kansas citizens into giving him the story and, as he gets deeper and deeper into the minds of the killers, lose his soul. Capote was as manipulative as he was charismatic, and the scenes where he interacts with Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.)and feels the twin repulsion and desire for this man, ""Capote"" find a conscious at war with itself. At one point, Capote describes his attraction to Smith's similarities to himself as men who ""grew up in the same house....and he want out the back door, and I went out the front door.""As the years go on and the court case drags out through appeals (that Capote initiated), he realizes his work in progress - about these men he says he wants to make sure don't get portrayed as monsters (even as he realizes that they ARE monsters) in his novel - is actually becoming a monster that has swallowed his whole. He watches his friend and author Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) get the masterpiece ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" published and then released as a movie while his ""In Cold Blood"" festers on the table, a work he can't bring to resolution as long as the appeals continue. He doesn't want the killers to die and he also knows the executions have to happen or his work will die.At the same time, Smith and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) play pedestrian malevolence so perfectly (especially Perry Smith) that you wonder what made these two make the leap from check frauding ne'er-dowells to ""In Cold Blood's"" murderers. When Smith finally tells Capote what happened, it is almost without petulance, a tear rolling down as he ""gets"" what has brought him to Death Row...and Capote's face roils with the turmoil of a man being rended by their intertwined fates.This incrementally crawling turmoil of ""Capote"" is one of the film's many strengths. You can feel the creeping time and the horror of disaster without the melodramatic crashes of what a lesser movie would have shoe-horned into a similar take on such a senseless crime. The evil of the mundane is what broke Capote's talents, and Hoffman's breakdown before the execution captures that instance perfectly. You'll not see many other movies take on a subject with this much weight with this much nuance. Capote - in the time it took him to complete ""In Cold Blood"" - went from literary Bon Vivant to a damaged man who never was able to complete another novel, even though his work ushered in a new age of American writers. It is in that realm that ""Capote"" transcends mere biography and ends as great cinema.",5,The Banality Of Evil,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,3310,"['Watching', 'slow', 'moving', 'pace', 'Capote', 'made', 'marvel', 'how', 'much', 'modern', 'film', 'making', 'depends', 'rapid', 'cuts', 'digitized', 'sweeps', 'mark', 'passages', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'single', 'camera', 'shots', 'film', 'years', 'guess', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'hold', 'moral', 'center', 'way', 'many', 'less', 'aware', 'viewers', 'seem', 'put', 'off', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'affected', 'speech', 'patterns', 'anyone', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'legendary', 'presence', 'THIS', 'WHAT', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WAS', 'LIKE', 'So', 'bio-pic', 'Hoffman', 'way', 'imitation', 'making', 'understand', 'who', 'Capote', 'was', 'true', 'focus', 'picture', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'wanted', 'find', 'topic', 'would', 'make', 'giant', 'literary', 'world', 'found', 'Clutter', 'Family', 'Murders', 'Kansas', 'see', 'charm', 'small', 'town', 'Kansas', 'citizens', 'giving', 'story', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'minds', 'killers', 'lose', 'soul', 'Capote', 'was', 'as', 'manipulative', 'was', 'charismatic', 'scenes', 'where', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'twin', 'repulsion', 'desire', 'man', 'Capote', 'find', 'conscious', 'war', 'one', 'point', 'Capote', 'attraction', 'Smith', 'similarities', 'men', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'same', 'house', 'out', 'back', 'door', 'went', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'years', 'go', 'court', 'case', 'out', 'appeals', 'Capote', 'initiated', 'work', 'progress', 'men', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'portrayed', 'monsters', 'even', 'ARE', 'monsters', 'novel', 'actually', 'becoming', 'monster', 'swallowed', 'whole', 'friend', 'author', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'get', 'masterpiece', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'published', 'then', 'released', 'movie', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'festers', 'table', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'resolution', 'as', 'long', 'appeals', 'continue', ""n't"", 'want', 'killers', 'die', 'also', 'executions', 'have', 'happen', 'work', 'will', 'die.At', 'same', 'time', 'Smith', 'Dick', 'Hickock', 'Mark', 'Pellegrino', 'play', 'pedestrian', 'malevolence', 'so', 'perfectly', 'especially', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'wonder', 'what', 'made', 'two', 'make', 'leap', 'check', 'frauding', ""ne'er-dowells"", 'Cold', 'Blood', 'murderers', 'When', 'Smith', 'finally', 'Capote', 'what', 'happened', 'almost', 'petulance', 'tear', 'rolling', 'down', 'brought', 'Death', 'Row', 'Capote', 'face', 'turmoil', 'man', 'being', 'rended', 'intertwined', 'fates.This', 'incrementally', 'crawling', 'turmoil', 'Capote', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'strengths', 'can', 'feel', 'creeping', 'time', 'horror', 'disaster', 'melodramatic', 'crashes', 'what', 'lesser', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'shoe-horned', 'similar', 'take', 'senseless', 'crime', 'evil', 'mundane', 'what', 'broke', 'Capote', 'talents', 'Hoffman', 'breakdown', 'execution', 'instance', 'perfectly', ""'ll"", 'not', 'see', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'take', 'subject', 'much', 'weight', 'much', 'nuance', 'Capote', 'time', 'took', 'complete', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'went', 'literary', 'Bon', 'Vivant', 'damaged', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'was', 'able', 'complete', 'novel', 'even', 'work', 'ushered', 'new', 'age', 'American', 'writers', 'realm', 'Capote', 'mere', 'biography', 'as', 'great', 'cinema']",N/A

It's a bit like having the Venus of Villendorf playing the role of the Frank Lloyd Wright garden sprite.But PSH totally, completely pulled it off.  This is a brilliant performance; he pulls off the mannerisms, the accent, the vanity, the ruthlessness and the self-doubt of Capote.  One of the most brilliant writers of his generation, Capote managed to squander his talent in an orgy of booze, drugs and self-destructive behavior, culminating in his literary seppuku, a short story titled ""la Cote Basque"", a scandelous Roman-a-Clef which led to his banishment from New York society.  This movie follows him from the time between his comet-like burst on the literary world with ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"" and later ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".  Capote audaciously invented a genre: the non-fiction novel.  This is that story.The supporting cast is uniformely superb.

967057,A233QN6P2EEKPS,B000E33VWW,Tom Collier,"[4, 7]","Within the first several minutes of Capote, Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the title character reveals itself as phenomenal, the complete transformation in character that most actors could only dream of. Every solitary word, movement, and gesture is flawless, engrossing in ways equal to the best work of Brando, Di Niro, Olivier, and Penn. As far as reviewing films go, Capote plays out like a baseball game where one team scores 20 runs before the first out.Truman Capote, the (in)famous writer and celebrity gossip machine, was not an easy figure to grasp. He was a brilliant writer and man in general, with no qualms about gleefully showing his genius off. He was also as effeminate as three Miss America pageants, deeply insecure, with a childhood that would outright obliterate lesser men. Early in the film we see him as the center of attention at a hip New York party, but minutes later he pays a bellhop to rave about his works in front of a pre-TKAM Harper Lee.Capote is drawn, almost mysteriously, to a small Kansas town where a family was brutally shot-gunned for no apparent reason. The locals do not quite know what to make of him, but he is charming and manipulative in a way they have never seen, and before long he has befriended everyone he needs to, including the sheriff (Chris Cooper). His ability to recall 94% of what he reads comes in handy for both interviews as well as impressing the citizenry. When the murderers are apprehended, he nearly jumps for joy, seeing an opportunity to write an amazing book, a `non-fiction novel'.Exploiting someone for material for a book isn't a pleasant experience, even if they are a murderer. Capote, ever seeking approval in a world he can never call home, barely even tries to defend himself when others accuse him of exploitation. When one of the killers asks Capote about the book's title, claims not to know, neglecting to mention that In Cold Blood has been decided upon.He immediately finds himself attracted to Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), a soft spoken but undeniably chilling man with whom Capote sees as both a kindred spirit and a gold mine.  His visits to Smith on death row are light on homo-eroticism and heavy on desperation. Smith desperately needs a friend, and does not want to be remembered as a monster; Capote must balance his attraction and desire to help Smith with the fact that he needs a gruesome re-telling of the murder, and most morbidly, a final ending to his book. Life in prison won't do the trick.Capote's relationship with Smith and experience when writing his masterpiece becomes all consuming, dragging his psyche into places more horrific than even he imagined. Smith can appear gentle and pained, but the vicious murderer never moves far under the surface.  When Capote finally hears Smith's calm and straightforward description of how he murdered an entire family with no remorse, Capote's soul crosses the point of no return.Nothing short of spellbinding, gut-wrenching, and brilliant, Capote deserves recognition as an instant classic. Masterfully crafted on every level and with physically palatable power, it epitomizes why the movies are the most poignant and relevant art form today.",5,Capote wows in every detail,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,3206,"['first', 'several', 'minutes', 'Capote', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'title', 'character', 'phenomenal', 'complete', 'transformation', 'character', 'most', 'actors', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'solitary', 'word', 'movement', 'gesture', 'flawless', 'engrossing', 'ways', 'equal', 'best', 'work', 'Brando', 'Di', 'Niro', 'Olivier', 'Penn', 'As', 'far', 'reviewing', 'films', 'go', 'Capote', 'out', 'baseball', 'game', 'where', 'one', 'team', '20', 'runs', 'first', 'out.Truman', 'Capote', 'famous', 'writer', 'celebrity', 'gossip', 'machine', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'figure', 'grasp', 'was', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'man', 'general', 'qualms', 'gleefully', 'showing', 'genius', 'off', 'was', 'also', 'as', 'effeminate', 'three', 'Miss', 'America', 'pageants', 'deeply', 'insecure', 'childhood', 'would', 'outright', 'obliterate', 'lesser', 'men', 'Early', 'film', 'see', 'center', 'attention', 'hip', 'New', 'York', 'party', 'minutes', 'later', 'bellhop', 'rave', 'works', 'front', 'pre-TKAM', 'Harper', 'Lee.Capote', 'drawn', 'almost', 'mysteriously', 'small', 'Kansas', 'town', 'where', 'family', 'was', 'brutally', 'shot-gunned', 'apparent', 'reason', 'locals', 'do', 'not', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'charming', 'manipulative', 'way', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'long', 'befriended', 'everyone', 'including', 'sheriff', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'ability', 'recall', '94', '%', 'what', 'handy', 'interviews', 'as', 'well', 'impressing', 'citizenry', 'When', 'murderers', 'are', 'apprehended', 'nearly', 'joy', 'seeing', 'opportunity', 'write', 'amazing', 'book', 'non-fiction', ""novel'.Exploiting"", 'someone', 'material', 'book', ""n't"", 'pleasant', 'experience', 'even', 'are', 'murderer', 'Capote', 'ever', 'seeking', 'approval', 'world', 'can', 'never', 'call', 'home', 'barely', 'even', 'defend', 'when', 'others', 'accuse', 'exploitation', 'When', 'one', 'killers', 'asks', 'Capote', 'book', 'title', 'not', 'know', 'neglecting', 'mention', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'been', 'decided', 'upon.He', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'soft', 'spoken', 'undeniably', 'chilling', 'man', 'whom', 'Capote', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'gold', 'mine', 'visits', 'Smith', 'death', 'row', 'are', 'light', 'homo-eroticism', 'heavy', 'desperation', 'Smith', 'desperately', 'friend', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'remembered', 'monster', 'Capote', 'must', 'balance', 'attraction', 'desire', 'help', 'Smith', 'fact', 'gruesome', 're-telling', 'murder', 'most', 'morbidly', 'final', 'ending', 'book', 'Life', 'prison', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'trick.Capote', 'relationship', 'Smith', 'experience', 'when', 'writing', 'masterpiece', 'consuming', 'dragging', 'psyche', 'places', 'more', 'horrific', 'even', 'imagined', 'Smith', 'can', 'appear', 'gentle', 'pained', 'vicious', 'murderer', 'never', 'far', 'surface', 'When', 'Capote', 'finally', 'Smith', 'calm', 'straightforward', 'description', 'how', 'murdered', 'entire', 'family', 'remorse', 'Capote', 'soul', 'point', 'return.Nothing', 'short', 'spellbinding', 'gut-wrenching', 'brilliant', 'Capote', 'recognition', 'instant', 'classic', 'Masterfully', 'crafted', 'level', 'physically', 'palatable', 'power', 'why', 'movies', 'are', 'most', 'poignant', 'relevant', 'art', 'form', 'today']",N/A

The film, which begins with the horrible murders of one family in Kansas, 1959, quietly presents its subject matter when Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman perfectly in character) starts to research the killings with his then assistant Harper Lee (Catherine Keener, completely different turn from Trish in 'The 40 Year Old Virgin').You will immediately notice that Capote in this film is not only a doggedly resolute researcher who does not scruple to lie before Perry Smith, one of the killers who were later arrested - this writer is also a great conversationalist, who can easily obtain the trust of Sheriff Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) and even Perry himself. It is amazing to see his art of conversation, or I should say, his monologue because after all Capote does not take no for answer, and whatever he says, the listeners would listen anyway.[IN COLD BLOOD] And Capote finishes writing a book `In Cold Blood' a masterpiece that cements his fame in the history of literature only after paying a price, which turns out bigger than he had imagined. Maybe the film implies that `In Cold Blood' means in fact not just about the heinous murders in Kansas themselves, but about something else, something that the author of the book had to have while creating this seminal work.The film is not an easy watch for some. It sometimes doesn't move fast, and the main character is not a `good man' (whatever the definition of it) that you are ready to relate to. If you ask me whether or not the film is an epoch-making one, like the book real Capote wrote, I have to say I am not sure.

Saturen,"[0, 0]","In an echo of Faust, celebrated writer Truman Capote was driven by hubris to abandon his conscience in pursuit of his greatest work, the nonfiction crime novel ""In Cold Blood."" With tense dialogue and compelling performances, the film portrays Capote's inner conflict between compassion for his subjects and intense literary ambition, which ultimately paved the way for the author's psychological unraveling.In 1959, Capote and his lifelong friend, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" author Nelle Harper Lee, travel to Kansas to write about the murder of the wealthy Clutter family. As the story blossoms into a novel, Capote develops a friendship with one of the killers, the troubled Perry Smith. During his interviews with Smith, Capote genuinely empathizes and identifies with the young man, who endured a similarly lonely, traumatic childhood. Despite this sympathy, Capote wants Smith to receive the death penalty in order to provide an ending for the novel. Smith comes to see Capote as a friend and his only hope, a deception that Capote weaves in order to get him to talk.Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives a truly brilliant performance, expertly capturing Capote's distinctive voice and mannerisms as well as the nuances of the writer's inner turmoil. Catherine Keener fits well the role of Harper Lee, whose friendship with Capote provides a voice of conscience and creates some of the film's humorous moments (after a porter raves about Capote's work, Lee turns to him and says knowingly, ""You paid him to say that."" Capote is incredulous: ""How did you know?!"").Like that of Faust, Capote's vanity proves to be his undoing. He never wrote another novel and descended into alcoholism, haunted by the remorse reflected in the epitaph of his final, unfinished work: ""More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones.""",5,Answered Prayers...,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,1824,"['echo', 'Faust', 'celebrated', 'writer', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'was', 'driven', 'hubris', 'abandon', 'conscience', 'pursuit', 'greatest', 'work', 'nonfiction', 'crime', 'novel', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'tense', 'dialogue', 'compelling', 'performances', 'film', 'Capote', 'inner', 'conflict', 'compassion', 'subjects', 'intense', 'literary', 'ambition', 'ultimately', 'paved', 'way', 'author', 'psychological', 'unraveling.In', '1959', 'Capote', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'author', 'Nelle', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'travel', 'Kansas', 'write', 'murder', 'wealthy', 'Clutter', 'family', 'story', 'blossoms', 'novel', 'Capote', 'friendship', 'one', 'killers', 'troubled', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'interviews', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'genuinely', 'identifies', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'endured', 'similarly', 'lonely', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'sympathy', 'Capote', 'Smith', 'receive', 'death', 'penalty', 'order', 'provide', 'ending', 'novel', 'Smith', 'see', 'Capote', 'friend', 'only', 'hope', 'deception', 'Capote', 'order', 'get', 'talk.Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'expertly', 'capturing', 'Capote', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'as', 'well', 'nuances', 'writer', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'well', 'role', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'friendship', 'Capote', 'voice', 'conscience', 'film', 'humorous', 'moments', 'porter', 'Capote', 'work', 'Lee', 'knowingly', 'paid', 'say', 'Capote', 'incredulous', 'How', 'did', 'know', '.Like', 'Faust', 'Capote', 'vanity', 'be', 'undoing', 'never', 'wrote', 'novel', 'descended', 'alcoholism', 'haunted', 'remorse', 'reflected', 'epitaph', 'final', 'unfinished', 'work', 'More', 'tears', 'are', 'shed', 'answered', 'prayers', 'unanswered', 'ones']",N/A

In his quest for the story that became the book ""In Cold Blood,"" one of Capote's most cherished prayers was answered. This film explores the way that quest and its ending essentially destroyed him. It is a powerful work.""Capote"" explores the corrupting power of a story, a story of two men whose humanity was lost for a few dollars when they brutally murdered a family in Kansas during a robbery gone bad. How curious we all feel to understand the why and how of such an event! Before Capote's novelistic portrayal of this crime, however, there was a kind of taboo against mixing fact and fiction, against allowing one's personal desires to inform how a story like this would be told. ""In Cold Blood"" shattered that taboo. I'm old enough still to remember how new and strange and shocking the book was.The film is not about the book, but about the making of it. It steadily and meticulously (if not always accurately) dramatizes the longings and compromises that seduced Capote as he befriended Perry Smith, one of the murderers. It unfolds his complicated but fiinally dishonest relationship with this man, whom he saw as a kind of fellow outcast.We do not end up admiring the protagonist, but just as he is implicated in the crime he begs to hear more about, so we -- the audience -- are also implicated; we come to need to hear that story too, which Smith delivers finally in a wrenching scene that is the turning point of this film. Like Capote, we also need to witness to the deaths of the killers. And we too are made willingly complicit in whatever distortions the film-makers also introduced when they put together their own ""true story"" of Capote's journey. The film has many levels, as we too then must confront the complexity of our human guilt as witnesses and storytellers ourselves, which I take to be the point of the movie.Philip Seymour Hoffman won best actor for this picture; he deserved the award. He is amazing. The emotions he shows and those he represses bring the ambiguous and not entirely unsympathetic Capote to life. His final meeting with Smith (played skillfully but without brilliance by Clifton Collins) is one of the most moving scenes I've ever seen in the cinema. Catherine Keener as Harper Lee and Chris Cooper as the DA who caught the killers are also very good; Cooper especially was well cast and brings his characteristic gut-busting, understated tension to the part.",5,Answered Prayers,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,2578,"['epigraph', 'film', 'end', 'words', 'appended', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'last', 'unfinished', 'work', 'More', 'tears', 'are', 'shed', 'answered', 'prayers', 'unanswered', 'ones', 'quest', 'story', 'became', 'book', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'one', 'Capote', 'most', 'cherished', 'prayers', 'was', 'answered', 'film', 'way', 'quest', 'ending', 'essentially', 'destroyed', 'powerful', 'work', 'Capote', 'corrupting', 'power', 'story', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'humanity', 'was', 'lost', 'few', 'dollars', 'when', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'family', 'Kansas', 'robbery', 'gone', 'bad', 'How', 'curious', 'feel', 'understand', 'why', 'how', 'such', 'event', 'Capote', 'novelistic', 'portrayal', 'crime', 'however', 'was', 'kind', 'taboo', 'mixing', 'fact', 'fiction', 'allowing', 'one', 'personal', 'desires', 'inform', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'told', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'shattered', 'taboo', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'still', 'remember', 'how', 'new', 'strange', 'shocking', 'book', 'was.The', 'film', 'not', 'book', 'making', 'steadily', 'meticulously', 'not', 'always', 'accurately', 'longings', 'compromises', 'seduced', 'Capote', 'befriended', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'one', 'murderers', 'complicated', 'fiinally', 'dishonest', 'relationship', 'man', 'whom', 'saw', 'kind', 'fellow', 'outcast.We', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'admiring', 'protagonist', 'just', 'implicated', 'crime', 'hear', 'more', 'audience', 'are', 'also', 'implicated', 'come', 'need', 'hear', 'story', 'too', 'Smith', 'delivers', 'finally', 'wrenching', 'scene', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'Capote', 'also', 'need', 'witness', 'deaths', 'killers', 'too', 'are', 'made', 'willingly', 'complicit', 'distortions', 'film-makers', 'also', 'introduced', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'own', 'true', 'story', 'Capote', 'journey', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'too', 'then', 'must', 'confront', 'complexity', 'human', 'guilt', 'witnesses', 'storytellers', 'ourselves', 'take', 'be', 'point', 'movie.Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'won', 'best', 'actor', 'picture', 'deserved', 'award', 'amazing', 'emotions', 'bring', 'ambiguous', 'not', 'entirely', 'unsympathetic', 'Capote', 'life', 'final', 'meeting', 'Smith', 'played', 'skillfully', 'brilliance', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'cinema', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'DA', 'who', 'caught', 'killers', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Cooper', 'especially', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'characteristic', 'gut-busting', 'understated', 'tension', 'part']",N/A
967065,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000E33VWW,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 4]","A mixture of biography and historical drama, ""Capote"" focuses on one of the pivotal events in Truman Capote's life; the research and writing of his novel  In Cold Blood and the impact that it had on his art but, more importantly, on his life. When a farm family is murdered in a seemingly random act of violence in the state of Kansas Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman who deservedly picked up an Academy Award for his performance) convinces his publisher to send him to uncover what exactly happened. Taking along Harper Lee (played by Catherine Keener, Lee was the author of To Kill a Mockingbird) as his research assistant Capote finds people and a culture that won't embrace him making his investigation difficult. Eventually Capote strikes up a friendship with FBI agent Alvin Dewey in charge of catching the killers (Academy Award winner Chris Cooper). Once the killers Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.)are caught Capote tries to find anyway possible to interview them for his story. He finds himself increasing drawn to Perry Smith a young, artistic individual who reminds Capote of a mirror image of himself. As Capote remarks, ""it's like we're the same person...except I ran out the front door and he ran out the back door"". Increasingly Capote loses his objectivity and also risks alienating his friends as he is drawn increasingly into the orbit of the sensitive, intelligent Perry. Riveting with powerful performances intelligently written (by actor/writer Dan Futterman) and directed (by Bennett Miller) ""Capote"" won't be everyone's cup of tea but it's a complex portrait of one of America's major writers at a turning point in his career.An extremely nice transfer from Sony, ""Capote"" has stunning detail and perfectly captures the colors of the film. I was really surprised though at the dirt and specks evident in this transfer. It's something I might have expected from a film 10 years old but nothing as recent or new as this film. It's most noticeable in the shots of the flat farm land of Kansas where the horizon seems to stretch forever. The 5.1 mix makes minimal use of the format the music and dialogue dominating the film. Still there is some nice use of the surround channels for sound effects and background noise.The two most prominent and important special features are the two commentary tracks. The first features director Miller and actor Hoffman. It's a fairly low key affair with the duo focusing on the shooting of the film and performances.  Hoffman doesn't dwell too much on the technical aspects of his performance preferring to discuss the craft of acting of his co-stars. Miller does the honors again with director of photography Adam Kimmel. Miller and Kimmel focus on the visual aspect of the story and how it compliments both the performances and the story as well as providing interesting behind-the-scenes information.""Truman Capote: Answered Prayers"" uses interviews with Miller, Hoffman and Capote biographer Gerald Clarke (who wrote the book the film is based on) to portray the complex individual at the center of the story. It's an interesting thumb nail sketch of a complex, talented individual who peaked very early in his career. We also get a short documentary divided into two parts on the making of the film. ""Making Capote: Concept to Screen"" focuses on the pre-production of the film and the development of the screenplay. ""Making Capote: Defining a Style"" the second half of the documentary focuses on the look of the film. We also get the usual assortment of Sony previews but, strangely, not the original theatrical trailer for ""Capote"".""Capote"" is a fascinating character study about a complex, conflicted man who began an investigation of the brutal murders of a farm family and ended up becoming part of the story as he searched for the story. The film looks extremely good despite some minor analog defects and has some solid but basic extras including two strong commentary tracks. ""Capote"" provides us with the drama in both the author's life during a key time in his development as an artist and also how he slid down the slippery slope moving from observer to one of the observed participants related to the horrible murders of an innocent family.",5,Beware of answered prayers,1143158400,"03 24, 2006",2006,4251,"['mixture', 'biography', 'historical', 'drama', 'Capote', 'one', 'pivotal', 'events', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'life', 'research', 'writing', 'novel', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'impact', 'had', 'art', 'more', 'importantly', 'life', 'When', 'farm', 'family', 'murdered', 'seemingly', 'random', 'act', 'violence', 'state', 'Kansas', 'Capote', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'deservedly', 'picked', 'up', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'publisher', 'send', 'uncover', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'Taking', 'along', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Lee', 'was', 'author', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'research', 'assistant', 'Capote', 'people', 'culture', 'wo', ""n't"", 'embrace', 'making', 'investigation', 'difficult', 'Eventually', 'Capote', 'up', 'friendship', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'charge', 'catching', 'killers', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'killers', 'Richard', 'Hickock', 'Mark', 'Pellegrino', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'are', 'caught', 'Capote', 'tries', 'find', 'anyway', 'possible', 'interview', 'story', 'increasing', 'drawn', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'young', 'artistic', 'individual', 'who', 'Capote', 'mirror', 'image', 'Capote', 'remarks', ""'re"", 'same', 'person', 'ran', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'ran', 'out', 'back', 'door', 'Increasingly', 'Capote', 'objectivity', 'also', 'risks', 'alienating', 'friends', 'drawn', 'increasingly', 'orbit', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'Perry', 'Riveting', 'powerful', 'performances', 'intelligently', 'written', 'actor/writer', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'directed', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'Capote', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'complex', 'portrait', 'one', 'America', 'major', 'writers', 'turning', 'point', 'career.An', 'extremely', 'nice', 'transfer', 'Sony', 'Capote', 'stunning', 'detail', 'perfectly', 'colors', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'though', 'dirt', 'specks', 'evident', 'transfer', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'film', '10', 'years', 'old', 'nothing', 'recent', 'new', 'film', 'most', 'noticeable', 'shots', 'flat', 'farm', 'land', 'Kansas', 'where', 'horizon', 'stretch', 'forever', '5.1', 'mix', 'minimal', 'use', 'format', 'music', 'dialogue', 'dominating', 'film', 'Still', 'nice', 'use', 'surround', 'channels', 'sound', 'effects', 'background', 'noise.The', 'two', 'most', 'prominent', 'important', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'first', 'features', 'director', 'Miller', 'actor', 'Hoffman', 'fairly', 'low', 'key', 'affair', 'duo', 'focusing', 'shooting', 'film', 'performances', 'Hoffman', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'much', 'technical', 'aspects', 'performance', 'preferring', 'discuss', 'craft', 'acting', 'co-stars', 'Miller', 'honors', 'again', 'director', 'photography', 'Adam', 'Kimmel', 'Miller', 'Kimmel', 'focus', 'visual', 'aspect', 'story', 'how', 'performances', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'interesting', 'behind-the-scenes', 'information', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Answered', 'Prayers', 'interviews', 'Miller', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'biographer', 'Gerald', 'Clarke', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'portray', 'complex', 'individual', 'center', 'story', 'interesting', 'thumb', 'nail', 'sketch', 'complex', 'talented', 'individual', 'who', 'peaked', 'very', 'early', 'career', 'also', 'get', 'short', 'documentary', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'making', 'film', 'Making', 'Capote', 'Concept', 'Screen', 'pre-production', 'film', 'development', 'screenplay', 'Making', 'Capote', 'Defining', 'Style', 'second', 'half', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'look', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'usual', 'assortment', 'Sony', 'previews', 'strangely', 'not', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Capote', 'Capote', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'complex', 'conflicted', 'man', 'who', 'began', 'investigation', 'brutal', 'murders', 'farm', 'family', 'ended', 'up', 'becoming', 'part', 'story', 'searched', 'story', 'film', 'extremely', 'good', 'minor', 'analog', 'defects', 'solid', 'basic', 'extras', 'including', 'two', 'strong', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Capote', 'drama', 'author', 'life', 'key', 'time', 'development', 'artist', 'also', 'how', 'slid', 'down', 'slippery', 'slope', 'moving', 'observer', 'one', 'observed', 'participants', 'related', 'horrible', 'murders', 'innocent', 'family']",N/A

967068,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B000E33VWW,Wesley Mullins,"[3, 4]","""Until one morning in mid-November of 1959, few Americans - in fact, few Kansans - had ever heard of Holcomb. Like the waters of a river, like the motorists on the highway, and like the yellow trains streaking down the Santa Fe tracks, drama, in the shape of exceptional happenings, had never stopped there."" (from In Cold Blood)Truman Capote invented the ""non-fiction novel"" with words like those.  The small town in Kansas would gain national fame when two vagabond criminals murdered a Rockwellian family of four, blasting shotgun pellets into their faces at close range and splattering blood onto perfectly made beds and floors that seemed to be washed daily.  The film ""Capote"" tells of the writer's immediate fascination with the consequences of such an act on a conservative buttoned-down town and his eventual relationship with the killers who stole Kansas' innocence.Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the enigmatic writer and the pursuit that would haunt the rest of his days.  Those unfamiliar with the writer will get a crash course in who he was, his homosexuality, his drinking, his odd presentation and speaking.  But more importantly, all viewers will see how the killings in Kansas and their consequences would virtually end his writing career, as ""In Cold Blood"" was the only book he published in the last two decades of his life.In the film, Capote connects with the killers, as he sees the world divided into two categories: those like the church-going, milk drinking, ""yes ma'am"" saying murder victims and the rest of the world, the outsiders.  He and the killers belong to the latter group, and only a fine line exists between them.  ""It's as if we were bothers, and one day he went out the back door while I went out the front,"" Capote says of Perry Smith, the man who slit the throat of the family patriarch.  Just as Capote faced ridicule and judgment all his life because of his eccentricity, so did the killers.  Thus, a bond.His initial quest for a story leads him on a conflicting journey, as he is torn between his duties as a literary journalist and the love he develops for his new ""brothers"".  As his relationship with Smith deepens, Capote wishes to fully understand the murderer and include his humanity in the book, so that the world won't forever think of him as a monster.  But the more he tries to whitewash through understanding, the bloodier his friend's hands become.Capote does not want the men to die, and the film certainly has anti-death penalty aspirations.  But it does not develop them irresponsibly.  The killers are not romanticized (a la Monster) and the people who support that act are not sadistic fire-breathers (Dead Man Walking).  The death penalty is shown for what it is: a brutal act brought about by the actions of horrible people.Hollywood is in the middle of a Renaissance with biographies and ""Capote"" shows them all how less is more.  So many films try to reduce a person's life to a few hours, an impossible task.  ""Capote"" instead trusts the audience to grasp the totality of the man by focusing on the most important episode in his life.  Audiences will come away from this film knowing as much about the essence of Truman Capote as is learned about Howard Hughes, Ray Charles or Johnny Cash in recent films of their lives.  But unlike the other three, ""Capote"" does not suffer from a disjointed, meandering narrative.  The focus instead is on one event, and the result is a biopic against which all others should be measured.",5,One of 2005's best,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,3489,"['one', 'morning', 'mid-November', '1959', 'few', 'Americans', 'fact', 'few', 'Kansans', 'had', 'ever', 'heard', 'Holcomb', 'waters', 'river', 'motorists', 'highway', 'yellow', 'trains', 'streaking', 'down', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'tracks', 'drama', 'shape', 'exceptional', 'happenings', 'had', 'never', 'stopped', 'there', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'invented', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'words', 'small', 'town', 'Kansas', 'would', 'gain', 'national', 'fame', 'when', 'two', 'vagabond', 'criminals', 'murdered', 'Rockwellian', 'family', 'four', 'blasting', 'shotgun', 'pellets', 'close', 'range', 'splattering', 'blood', 'perfectly', 'made', 'beds', 'floors', 'seemed', 'be', 'washed', 'daily', 'film', 'Capote', 'tells', 'writer', 'immediate', 'fascination', 'consequences', 'such', 'act', 'conservative', 'buttoned-down', 'town', 'eventual', 'relationship', 'killers', 'who', 'stole', 'Kansas', 'innocence.Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'enigmatic', 'writer', 'pursuit', 'would', 'haunt', 'rest', 'days', 'unfamiliar', 'writer', 'will', 'get', 'crash', 'course', 'who', 'was', 'homosexuality', 'drinking', 'odd', 'presentation', 'speaking', 'more', 'importantly', 'viewers', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'killings', 'Kansas', 'consequences', 'would', 'virtually', 'end', 'writing', 'career', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'was', 'only', 'book', 'published', 'last', 'two', 'decades', 'life.In', 'film', 'Capote', 'killers', 'world', 'divided', 'two', 'categories', 'church-going', 'milk', 'drinking', 'yes', ""ma'am"", 'saying', 'murder', 'victims', 'rest', 'world', 'outsiders', 'killers', 'belong', 'latter', 'group', 'only', 'fine', 'line', 'exists', 'were', 'bothers', 'one', 'day', 'went', 'out', 'back', 'door', 'went', 'out', 'front', 'Capote', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'man', 'who', 'slit', 'throat', 'family', 'patriarch', 'Just', 'Capote', 'faced', 'ridicule', 'judgment', 'life', 'eccentricity', 'so', 'did', 'killers', 'Thus', 'bond.His', 'initial', 'quest', 'story', 'conflicting', 'journey', 'torn', 'duties', 'literary', 'journalist', 'love', 'new', 'brothers', 'relationship', 'Smith', 'deepens', 'Capote', 'fully', 'understand', 'murderer', 'include', 'humanity', 'book', 'world', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forever', 'think', 'monster', 'more', 'whitewash', 'understanding', 'bloodier', 'friend', 'hands', 'become.Capote', 'not', 'want', 'men', 'die', 'film', 'certainly', 'anti-death', 'penalty', 'aspirations', 'not', 'develop', 'irresponsibly', 'killers', 'are', 'not', 'romanticized', 'la', 'Monster', 'people', 'who', 'support', 'act', 'are', 'not', 'sadistic', 'fire-breathers', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'death', 'penalty', 'shown', 'what', 'brutal', 'act', 'brought', 'about', 'actions', 'horrible', 'people.Hollywood', 'middle', 'Renaissance', 'biographies', 'Capote', 'how', 'less', 'more', 'So', 'many', 'films', 'try', 'reduce', 'person', 'life', 'few', 'hours', 'impossible', 'task', 'Capote', 'instead', 'audience', 'grasp', 'totality', 'man', 'focusing', 'most', 'important', 'episode', 'life', 'Audiences', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'knowing', 'as', 'much', 'essence', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'learned', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'recent', 'films', 'lives', 'other', 'three', 'Capote', 'not', 'suffer', 'disjointed', 'meandering', 'narrative', 'focus', 'instead', 'one', 'event', 'result', 'biopic', 'others', 'should', 'be', 'measured']",N/A
967069,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B000E33VWW,Westley,"[4, 5]","""Capote"" focuses on the time period when the author was researching ""In Cold Blood.""  Truman Capote was already a renowned author in 1959; however, the book would change his career and alter how non-fiction was written and perceived.  Clearly, being involved with that book changed Capote's life personally as well.  The film commences with the murder of the Clutter family in the tiny town of Holcomb, Kansas.  The murder was particularly brutal and made news across the country, which is how Truman Capote stumbled across the story.  Capote travels to Kansas with his friend, Harper Lee, hoping to write a story for the New Yorker.  Obtaining information was slow-going at first, as he was competing with other media.  However, Capote and Lee used their charms to make friends with local officials.  Eventually, Capote would become friends with one of the murderers - Perry Smith - as well.The acting is absolutely stellar in ""Capote"": it's really an ""actor's movie.""  Philip Seymour Hoffman has been outstanding in many movies (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Magnolia, Happiness), but playing Truman Capote has finally established him as a star.  He nails the nasally whine of Capote but also captures a deeper essence; after a few minutes on screen, he becomes the author, without question.  Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, almost unrecognizable in a prim hairstyle and drab librarian-style clothing, is also terrific.  I hope this will lead to another Oscar nomination for her.  However, the real find here is Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith.  I've been a fan of his for years, especially his flamboyant work in ""Traffic.""  He's finally found a meaty role worthy of his talent.The final star of ""Capote"" is the screenplay; it's a literate movie for certain.  The witty script is filled with the kind of bon mots and clever quips Truman Capote himself so often made in television interviews.  The film recreates the 1960s literary scene in all its sexy vibrance.  However, for all its cleverness, the screenplay is not as impactful as one would hope.  ""In Cold Blood"" arguably is one of the best works of non-fiction ever, and the 1967 movie adaptation was brilliantly stark and mean.  Given the source material, I expected ""Capote"" to be a bit more affecting.  The conflicted relationship between Capote and Smith is interesting, but it's also strangely unmoving here.  Some viewers may prefer that a film that depicts morality in so many shades or gray remain a bit distant, but I wanted some catharsis.  Nevertheless, ""Capote"" is a very good movie with outstanding writing and acting.",4,"""I couldn't have done anything to save them.""",1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,2589,"['Capote', 'focuses', 'time', 'period', 'when', 'author', 'was', 'researching', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'was', 'already', 'renowned', 'author', '1959', 'however', 'book', 'would', 'change', 'career', 'alter', 'how', 'non-fiction', 'was', 'written', 'perceived', 'Clearly', 'being', 'involved', 'book', 'changed', 'Capote', 'life', 'personally', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'commences', 'murder', 'Clutter', 'family', 'tiny', 'town', 'Holcomb', 'Kansas', 'murder', 'was', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'made', 'news', 'country', 'how', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'stumbled', 'story', 'Capote', 'Kansas', 'friend', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'hoping', 'write', 'story', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Obtaining', 'information', 'was', 'slow-going', 'first', 'was', 'competing', 'other', 'media', 'However', 'Capote', 'Lee', 'used', 'charms', 'make', 'friends', 'local', 'officials', 'Eventually', 'Capote', 'would', 'become', 'friends', 'one', 'murderers', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'well.The', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'Capote', 'really', 'actor', 'movie', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'been', 'outstanding', 'many', 'movies', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'Magnolia', 'Happiness', 'playing', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'finally', 'established', 'star', 'nasally', 'whine', 'Capote', 'also', 'deeper', 'essence', 'few', 'minutes', 'screen', 'author', 'question', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'prim', 'hairstyle', 'drab', 'librarian-style', 'clothing', 'also', 'terrific', 'hope', 'will', 'lead', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'However', 'real', 'find', 'here', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Perry', 'Smith', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'years', 'especially', 'flamboyant', 'work', 'Traffic', 'finally', 'found', 'meaty', 'role', 'worthy', 'talent.The', 'final', 'star', 'Capote', 'screenplay', 'literate', 'movie', 'certain', 'witty', 'script', 'filled', 'kind', 'bon', 'mots', 'clever', 'quips', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'so', 'often', 'made', 'television', 'interviews', 'film', '1960s', 'literary', 'scene', 'sexy', 'vibrance', 'However', 'cleverness', 'screenplay', 'not', 'as', 'impactful', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'works', 'non-fiction', 'ever', '1967', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'stark', 'mean', 'Given', 'source', 'material', 'expected', 'Capote', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'affecting', 'conflicted', 'relationship', 'Capote', 'Smith', 'interesting', 'also', 'strangely', 'unmoving', 'here', 'viewers', 'may', 'prefer', 'film', 'morality', 'so', 'many', 'shades', 'gray', 'remain', 'bit', 'distant', 'wanted', 'catharsis', 'Nevertheless', 'Capote', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'writing', 'acting']",N/A

967071,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000E33VWW,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[2, 3]","I strongly believe that this film will certainly garner an Oscar nomination for Philip Seymour Hoffman. His portrayal of Truman Capote is mesmerizing, and it's even more challenging and convincing than his other works including Magnolia, Owning Mahoney, and Love Liza. I really didn't expect this film to move me, but that one scene when Capote(Hoffman) broke down into massive tears was so touching that I was crying along with him. This film is not a conventional biopic, since it only captures one major part of Capote's life, primarily focusing on his quest to uncover the truth behind the senseless murder of a Kansas farm family in 1959 in order to write his most acclaimed book entitled In Cold Blood. It covers the period when Capote was first inspired to write about the story upon reading the newspaper article, to spending more than four years of research and finally publishing the book in 1966.Truman Capote is an eccentric, humorous, and flamboyant openly gay writer. Hoffman certainly mastered the feminine mannerism, the babyish voice, and all the tormented heart and soul the Capote to perfection. Capote at one point told Perry Smith(Clifton Collins Jr.), one of the convicted murderer, that they are like twin brothers, and that one went out at the back door and the other went out the front door. They are in some ways, two of a kind, because they share very similar childhood abused and abandoned experiences. They just happened to have made very different choices in life. Smith chose to rob the farm family thinking that there was $10000 in the house, but he and his partner in crime ended up killing four members of that poor family for $45. Of course, that was the most important part of Capote's research, that took a lot of relentless pursuit.Catherine Keener plays Capote's best friend Nelle Harper Lee, who would eventually become an internationally with the release her novel To Kill A Mockingbird. Her performance is subdued, but her role is limited in screentime and not that challenging. Chris Cooper who played Alvin Dewey, the lawyer who refused to help Capote. The role is also somewhat low-key for the Oscar-winning(Adaptation) actor. Bruce Greenwood is delightful as Capote's affectionate lover, though they didn't have any love scenes to work with. The most striking supporting performance came from Clifton Collins Jr. who had some heavy duty scenes opposite Hoffman. He might be heading to the Best Supporting Actor cateogory come next month.Even though I found Capote to be kind of slow-paced, especially the first half an hour, it gradually becomes more gripping and emotionally affecting.",5,A Brilliant Character Actor At Work!,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,2632,"['strongly', 'believe', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'garner', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'portrayal', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'mesmerizing', 'even', 'more', 'challenging', 'convincing', 'other', 'works', 'including', 'Magnolia', 'Owning', 'Mahoney', 'Love', 'Liza', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'move', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Capote', 'Hoffman', 'broke', 'down', 'massive', 'tears', 'was', 'so', 'touching', 'was', 'crying', 'along', 'film', 'not', 'conventional', 'biopic', 'only', 'one', 'major', 'part', 'Capote', 'life', 'primarily', 'focusing', 'quest', 'uncover', 'truth', 'senseless', 'murder', 'Kansas', 'farm', 'family', '1959', 'order', 'write', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'book', 'entitled', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'period', 'when', 'Capote', 'was', 'first', 'inspired', 'write', 'story', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'article', 'spending', 'more', 'four', 'years', 'research', 'finally', 'publishing', 'book', '1966.Truman', 'Capote', 'eccentric', 'humorous', 'flamboyant', 'openly', 'gay', 'writer', 'Hoffman', 'certainly', 'mastered', 'feminine', 'mannerism', 'babyish', 'voice', 'tormented', 'heart', 'soul', 'Capote', 'perfection', 'Capote', 'one', 'point', 'told', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'one', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'are', 'twin', 'brothers', 'one', 'went', 'back', 'door', 'other', 'went', 'front', 'door', 'are', 'ways', 'two', 'kind', 'share', 'very', 'similar', 'childhood', 'abused', 'abandoned', 'experiences', 'just', 'happened', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'different', 'choices', 'life', 'Smith', 'chose', 'rob', 'farm', 'family', 'thinking', 'was', '10000', 'house', 'partner', 'crime', 'ended', 'up', 'killing', 'four', 'members', 'poor', 'family', '45', 'course', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'Capote', 'research', 'took', 'lot', 'relentless', 'pursuit.Catherine', 'Keener', 'Capote', 'best', 'friend', 'Nelle', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'who', 'would', 'eventually', 'become', 'internationally', 'release', 'novel', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'performance', 'subdued', 'role', 'limited', 'screentime', 'not', 'challenging', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'played', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'lawyer', 'who', 'refused', 'help', 'Capote', 'role', 'also', 'somewhat', 'low-key', 'Oscar-winning', 'Adaptation', 'actor', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'delightful', 'Capote', 'affectionate', 'lover', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'love', 'scenes', 'work', 'most', 'striking', 'supporting', 'performance', 'came', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'who', 'had', 'heavy', 'duty', 'scenes', 'opposite', 'Hoffman', 'might', 'be', 'heading', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'cateogory', 'come', 'next', 'month.Even', 'found', 'Capote', 'be', 'kind', 'slow-paced', 'especially', 'first', 'hour', 'gradually', 'more', 'gripping', 'emotionally', 'affecting']",N/A
