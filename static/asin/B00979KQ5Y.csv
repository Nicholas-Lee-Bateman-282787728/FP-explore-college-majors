1586733,AYDSX1WZ4NU17,B00979KQ5Y,Daryl Chin,"[15, 15]","This film is a real curiosity: it's a sharp, cynical comedy about the fashion industry in New York City. The reason it's a curiosity is that, from the credits (Abraham Polonsky wrote the script, from Jerome Weidman's novel; the movie's stars include Susan Hayward, George Sanders and Sam Jaffe), you would expect a film noir. (And there were film noirs that were set in the fashion industry: THE GARMENT JUNGLE is an example.) But here, the hard-edged dialogue delights in barbed repartee, the action is fast, and the actors perform with high energy, turning the machinations of the plot into an intricate weave of rapid-fire patterns which become as stylized as the entrances-and-exits of a boudoir farce.This was the third major script that Polonsky wrote set in New York City: the other two are BODY AND SOUL (directed by Robert Rossen) and his self-directed FORCE OF EVIL. Michael Gordon's direction is smoother and much less personal than Rossen or Polonsky himself, which also accounts for the accentuation of humor. This movie is a lot of fun, and it's a relief to see Susan Hayward sparring with Dan Dailey, rather than suffering as she did in so many of her other hits from the 1950s (WITH A SONG IN MY HEART, I'LL CRY TOMORROW, I WANT TO LIVE!). This movie consistently uses wisecracks to propel the story, and it's no wonder that, in the early 1960s, this material was turned into a musical comedy. But I CAN GET IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE doesn't need songs to sell this biting look at ambition and love in the fashion world.",4,Curiosity Killed the Cat,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,1531,"['film', 'real', 'curiosity', 'sharp', 'cynical', 'comedy', 'fashion', 'industry', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'reason', 'curiosity', 'credits', 'Abraham', 'Polonsky', 'wrote', 'script', 'Jerome', 'Weidman', 'novel', 'movie', 'stars', 'include', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Sam', 'Jaffe', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'noir', 'were', 'film', 'noirs', 'were', 'set', 'fashion', 'industry', 'GARMENT', 'JUNGLE', 'example', 'here', 'hard-edged', 'dialogue', 'delights', 'barbed', 'repartee', 'action', 'fast', 'actors', 'perform', 'high', 'energy', 'turning', 'machinations', 'plot', 'intricate', 'weave', 'rapid-fire', 'patterns', 'become', 'as', 'stylized', 'entrances-and-exits', 'boudoir', 'farce.This', 'was', 'third', 'major', 'script', 'Polonsky', 'wrote', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'BODY', 'AND', 'SOUL', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Rossen', 'self-directed', 'FORCE', 'OF', 'EVIL', 'Michael', 'Gordon', 'direction', 'smoother', 'much', 'less', 'personal', 'Rossen', 'Polonsky', 'also', 'accentuation', 'humor', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'relief', 'see', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'sparring', 'Dan', 'Dailey', 'rather', 'suffering', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'hits', '1950s', 'WITH', 'A', 'SONG', 'IN', 'MY', 'HEART', ""'LL"", 'CRY', 'TOMORROW', 'WANT', 'TO', 'LIVE', 'movie', 'consistently', 'wisecracks', 'propel', 'story', 'wonder', 'early', '1960s', 'material', 'was', 'turned', 'musical', 'comedy', 'CAN', 'GET', 'IT', 'FOR', 'YOU', 'WHOLESALE', ""n't"", 'need', 'songs', 'sell', 'biting', 'look', 'ambition', 'love', 'fashion', 'world']",I Can Get It for You Wholesale
