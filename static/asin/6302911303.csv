She comes over to deliver the package, but is met by a band of Shau Lin Monks (not ninja's, or so the ongoing joke in the film is) from china looking for the red lotus.  In her escape plan, she runs across ""brainsmasher"" bouncing at a local club, and the story unfolds from there.This is actually a very funny, reasonably spliced together movie.  I got this tape for 50 cents on clearence, and is available someplaces for even a quarter from a large re-tail rental store getting rid of VHS's.  It is a funny movie, andrew dice clay in his prime.

345108,A1OK9M013BF5RC,6302911303,E. Willi,"[0, 0]","Andrew Dice Clay and Teri Hatcher are so great in this movie. It really does feel like a love blooming between the characters as the action goes on. Even when separated at one point, Dice's character ""Ed Molloy"" continues to fight to protect Teri's character ""Samantha Crain"". Ed is a big, good-hearted, bouncer at a club. Samantha is a top model (stunning girl). Ed teaches her his top two self-defense moves and she does some good fighting! The dialog is filled with humor. The soundtrack features some striking vocals by Madelynn Von Ritz. The film should be re-released in DVD, since it is Dice and Teri at their best!

Yeah it's hard to imagine but an Andrew Dice Clay movie you can laugh your buns off with the kids. Terri (Lois & Clark) Hatcher is sensational. Clay is an overweight bouncer trying to protect a world class model from Ninja's. And of course save the world. Why it is not on DVD is a mystery to me. You gotta trust me on this one.
