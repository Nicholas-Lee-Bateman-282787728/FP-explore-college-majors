Micheal Oliver does a tremendous job playing Junior Healy, a devilish child who creates chaos for particularly no reason at all.  Even as a child, he placed under the door steps of many familys because nobody wants him.  Even in the orphanage, the nuns want to get rid of him and threaten one of their employees , Mr. Peabody (Gilbert Godfred who happens to be a huge loud mouth like Chris Tucker), to make sure it gets done or he gets fired.Anyway, the story is also about a couple by the name of Flo (Amy Yasbeck) and ""little Ben"" Healy who really want a child.  Flo is a real pain in the neck and Ben's dad ,""BIG Ben"" healy, totally hates him. studies have shown it can't be possible for them to give birth to a child but they can adopt one.  Mr. Peabody tricks them into thinking that junior is a good boy and that is just the beggining.  Junior makes things a living hell and at the same time junior's ""hero"" ,Martin Beck (Micheal Richards) who happens to be wanted criminal, wants to find JR and be partners in crime with him because he thinks junior is an x-con.This movie will bring you lots of laughs.  This is one movie you can't miss.  If you thought kids like Dennis Mitchell (Dennis the Menace kid)or Bart Simpson were america's #1 brats, well think again because this movie just might change your mind.

Correspondence with a prison inmate (who escapes and kidnaps Junior) is only one of his misadventures in this film.A little league game becomes ruined when Junior decides to play it 'his way'; Junior is mad that people think his father is a 'dork' and are calling him 'son of dork'. Ben Healy Senior (Jack Warden) becomes upset when Junior crashes the family car into his sporting goods store and helps derail his political ambitions.Eventually, Little Ben Healy (Ritter) decides that the only way to reach his son is to love him no matter what. Because this unconditional love was a new experience for Junior, he was initially suspicious, but later grew to love his father. Flo Healy (Yasbeck) is disposed of on a trailer truck of farm animals to who knows where at the end of the move.This movie obviously didn't have a big budget behind it, but it is hilarious for a 'family/children's movie.
