784174,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0000UJLTG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","DEAR GOD (1996, 113 minutes) I suspect is one of Greg Kinnear's several ""big-time debuts"". I don't think he has yet hit the high public-star-quality note that he deserves. Though this appears to be only a TV film, it is quite hilarious--and has deep messages I suspect we need more today than ever.Tom the Worm (Kinnear) has pulled his last con job to try to pay off his horse racing debts--or so he thinks. Being ordered by the court to get a job or else face jail, Tom's cousin gets him a shot at the post office. Tom lands in the Dead Letter Office, sorting hilarious correspondences addressed to everyone from Elvis to ""Martians""--and is stunned to find a gigantic influx of letters to God.This tried to be warm as well as funny but I think it fails with the former. Funny it is, an unusual ""oddball comedy"" from the 1990s when oddballs were really falling out of fashion. Kinnear needed a vehicle, and the number of surprise cameos clues the viewer to the importance of this production. It's no more than a TV movie but it usually hits the right spots. Tom's decision to respond to ""the God letters"" in order to see if he can eventually scam some cash turns into a most fascinating lesson in compassion.You'll laugh your eyes out at Tom's coworkers--Tim Conway does an excellent and today forgotten job as a former carrier who was sent down, and Jack Klugman makes a shockingly funny cameo too. I'm not so certain this deserves to be in a DVD collection--perhaps if you fancy yourself an archivist or something--but it is a truly humorous look at the U.S. Postal Serrvice as it was in the mid-1990s, pre-9/11, and the funny coffee-house-culture that ran amok before Baby Bush decimated our nation.You haven't lived until you see Hector Elizondo as Tom's Russian boss. A Russian, in the Post Office in the mid-1990s! This is one of the best cameos I've ever seen, but I won't spoil it which tips you off: watch Elizondo carefully.",4,For whom the cinnamon rolls,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,1934,"['DEAR', 'GOD', '1996', '113', 'minutes', 'suspect', 'one', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'several', 'big-time', 'debuts', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'yet', 'hit', 'high', 'public-star-quality', 'note', 'be', 'only', 'TV', 'film', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'deep', 'messages', 'suspect', 'need', 'more', 'today', 'Worm', 'Kinnear', 'pulled', 'last', 'con', 'job', 'try', 'pay', 'off', 'horse', 'racing', 'debts', 'so', 'Being', 'ordered', 'court', 'get', 'job', 'else', 'face', 'jail', 'Tom', 'cousin', 'shot', 'post', 'office', 'Tom', 'Dead', 'Letter', 'Office', 'sorting', 'hilarious', 'correspondences', 'addressed', 'everyone', 'Elvis', 'Martians', 'stunned', 'find', 'gigantic', 'influx', 'letters', 'God.This', 'tried', 'be', 'warm', 'as', 'well', 'funny', 'think', 'former', 'Funny', 'unusual', 'oddball', 'comedy', '1990s', 'when', 'oddballs', 'were', 'really', 'falling', 'fashion', 'Kinnear', 'needed', 'vehicle', 'number', 'surprise', 'cameos', 'viewer', 'importance', 'production', 'more', 'TV', 'movie', 'usually', 'right', 'spots', 'Tom', 'decision', 'respond', 'God', 'letters', 'order', 'see', 'can', 'eventually', 'scam', 'cash', 'most', 'fascinating', 'lesson', 'compassion.You', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'eyes', 'out', 'Tom', 'coworkers', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'excellent', 'today', 'forgotten', 'job', 'former', 'carrier', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'down', 'Jack', 'Klugman', 'shockingly', 'funny', 'cameo', 'too', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'certain', 'be', 'DVD', 'collection', 'perhaps', 'fancy', 'archivist', 'something', 'truly', 'humorous', 'look', 'U.S', 'Postal', 'Serrvice', 'was', 'mid-1990s', 'pre-9/11', 'funny', 'coffee-house-culture', 'ran', 'amok', 'Baby', 'Bush', 'decimated', 'nation.You', 'have', ""n't"", 'lived', 'see', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Tom', 'Russian', 'boss', 'Russian', 'Post', 'Office', 'mid-1990s', 'one', 'best', 'cameos', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'off', 'watch', 'Elizondo', 'carefully']",N/A

He must get a job after appearing in court and getting offered a choice between going to jail and getting that job. He winds up at the Post Office for the Christmas period and when he inadvertently opens up a letter to God. For some reason he decides to answer it with some jewelry he steals from the Post Office dead letter files. When he sends his cashed paycheck along it is an accident and he chases it but can't get it. The rest of the dead letter staff gets the spirit and things keep giving. There are several well known actors in this movie and they do an excellent job. Tim Conway, Laurie Metcalf, Hector Elizondo (although it is a reach to see a Hispanic having to portray what I guess is suppose to be a Russian accent), and Roscoe Lee Brown. When Brown gets pinched for giving a horn to a bum musician he gets grabbed by the Feds. Greg comes forward and says he did it all. At trial the whole gang comes forth and states they are the leader.
