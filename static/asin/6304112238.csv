402309,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6304112238,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Crisscross, 1992 filmThis story is set in 1969 Key West Florida. A divorced woman has a 12-year old son. We see their personal life at home. His mom and her friend go to a ""key club"". The son sees his mom perform. Then he hitches a ride to Miami to find his dad, who works as a gardener in a monastery. They talk about the past. His mom comes to take him home. Can they all talk? No. ""Someday you'll understand."" The father talked about his past (a veteran of Vietnam and an Annapolis graduate). On the way home their car stops and they talk about their past life. Can Christopher repair the carburetor? [The news on TV dates this story.] Christopher goes for a boat ride with his girlfriend, he will deliver a few fish. But he discovers something inside one fish!The recipient notices a missing fish. ""The dog ate it."" Christopher tells his mom he knows about her other job. He looks at the plastic pouch. [Is he wise beyond his years?] Christopher worries about his mom's dancing. Emmet tells him to dump that white powder and he does. His mom washes clothes at a laundromat. [Does this story drag on?] She meets a man there. Christopher talks back to his mom. [Is this leading to a tragedy?] Later Christopher offers to sell drugs to two strangers. Can they make a deal? Yes. They watch the moon landing n TV. [This wasn't cost-effective so it was never done again.] Christopher works at cleaning a pool. Later he visits his girlfriend. They are alone together. The next day he meets those two men who want to make a bi g deal. Can he do it? Later he sails out to visit a shrimp boat for a ""pickup"". But his fish are stolen by two masked men! Christopher has to explain his loss to the recipient. There is conflict. Joe comes to his aid.At night Christopher rides a bicycle to the meeting. Those two men know his name! [My suspicions about this pair were correct.] There is another surprise about his mom's boyfriend. Whose fault was it? Now Christopher is in big trouble! He is fingerprinted. ""Drugs ruing people's lives, just like the war in Vietnam."" Joe talks to Christopher's mom. ""So long."" They move to a trailer park where his mom is happier.There isn't much to like about this movie. Christopher seems to know too much for a 12-year old boy who doesn't have older male relatives or friends. Could a 12-year old boy know how to fix a carburetor? Only if he had older friends or relatives who could teach him. Would this boy get involved in a serious crime? His relations with a young girl also seem anachronistic for that time (and probably today).

402311,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6304112238,Kevin Killian,"[22, 22]","If you do, you'll be in hog heaven as Hawn portrays a piece of beach trash who tries a little late to mend her ways.  The relationship between her character and that of her son, who looks to be around 11 or 12 in the film, is one of the enduring accounts in the movies of a mother trying to stay too young and a boy overcome by urges he didn't know he had.  The young actor who plays the boy, David Arnott, does a fine job maneuvering between trying to be just a kid and having to deal with unexpected adult complexities.  He breaks your heart as he attempts valiantly to be the father to the eternally youthful and hedonistic character Goldie Hawn plays, she should be the mother but she doesn't know how to.  And Arliss Howard is in the movie too, always underrated, with killer looks and a mean streak that gives him a bit of Warren Oates-like excitement.  This movie tries to stretch Goldie Hawn's acting chops a bit but I think people will always prefer her in kind of ditsy comedy roles.  This one hit too close to home for her many fans to enjoy it, and there aren't really enough boy-watchers out there to have made this a huge hit on account of the then-unknown David Arnott.It's the kind of American movie that was being made in the age of the New American Cinema of the 1970s, a character-driven study of laziness, cruelty and unexpected courage, more akin perhaps to SUGARLAND EXPRESS or SHAMPOO than to any of Goldie's other films.  She and Arnott should team up for another picture today, it could be a hit, if enough marketing muscle is leveraged to get those asses into the seats as they say.",4,Add A Star If You Like Goldie Hawn,1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,1608,"['do', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hog', 'heaven', 'Hawn', 'piece', 'beach', 'trash', 'who', 'little', 'late', 'mend', 'ways', 'relationship', 'character', 'son', 'who', 'be', 'around', '11', '12', 'film', 'one', 'enduring', 'accounts', 'movies', 'mother', 'trying', 'stay', 'too', 'young', 'boy', 'overcome', 'urges', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'boy', 'David', 'Arnott', 'fine', 'job', 'maneuvering', 'trying', 'be', 'just', 'kid', 'having', 'deal', 'unexpected', 'adult', 'complexities', 'heart', 'valiantly', 'be', 'father', 'eternally', 'youthful', 'hedonistic', 'character', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'plays', 'should', 'be', 'mother', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Arliss', 'Howard', 'movie', 'too', 'always', 'underrated', 'killer', 'looks', 'mean', 'streak', 'bit', 'Warren', 'Oates-like', 'excitement', 'movie', 'stretch', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'acting', 'bit', 'think', 'people', 'will', 'always', 'prefer', 'kind', 'ditsy', 'comedy', 'roles', 'one', 'hit', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'many', 'fans', 'enjoy', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'enough', 'boy-watchers', 'there', 'have', 'made', 'huge', 'hit', 'account', 'then-unknown', 'David', 'Arnott.It', 'kind', 'American', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'age', 'New', 'American', 'Cinema', '1970s', 'character-driven', 'study', 'laziness', 'cruelty', 'unexpected', 'courage', 'more', 'akin', 'perhaps', 'SUGARLAND', 'EXPRESS', 'SHAMPOO', 'Goldie', 'other', 'films', 'Arnott', 'should', 'team', 'up', 'picture', 'today', 'could', 'be', 'hit', 'enough', 'marketing', 'muscle', 'leveraged', 'get', 'asses', 'seats', 'say']",Criss-Cross VHS

It's a true testament for trying your best, perhaps failing a little but not backing down when things go wrong.  The challenges to this role that Goldie created were breathtakingly brilliant.  I recommend this movie especially to single mom's who go through life trying to do their best for their kids.  I think Goldie will become one of your heroes.  You do what you have to do to raise your kids.  You may lose sight once in a while, but you can't be where the kids are all the time and you have to trust them and hope they do well.  They may take the wrong road, but it is the love of a mother that brings them back to living life correctly.  Bravo, Goldie.
