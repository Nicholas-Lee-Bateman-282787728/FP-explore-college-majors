I'm talking about Hard Boiled and The Killer. These both had high melodrama and an emotionally troubled hero. Dolph does quite a good job of this and  gives a pretty good performance.Many people criticise Dolph for not  being a good actor but when you forget that your watching him you'll  realise that he's quite good despite never having any acting lessons. This  is the first film in which I've seen him be a sort of father figure. I  think he handles dialogue well and tries his best to do as much as he can  in the mediocre roles he is offered. He should be in more high-profile  movies and should climb out of the DTV hell his career is in. His best film  so far is Joshua Tree but Blackjack is good to watch.John Woo's style  is written all over this film. More so than Broken Arrow (in which his  style was entirely muted). Color schemes, camera tricks and slow-mo  shootouts are all present in this movie. It's a little lacking, and  confusing, in the plot department but when your having so much fun it  doesn't matter THAT much.I heard somewhere that there is soon to be a  TV series of Blackjack. If there were I think I would enjoy it very much.  The only thing stopping this from being a high-profile hit is the fact that  it's a TV movie.

463959,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,6305428018,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","At the time that ""Blackjack"" was released, Dolph Lundgren was entering a stage of his career that would be marked by a decade of mostly forgettable direct-to-video fare: all his big pictures were behind him, and it had been three years since his face had been seen on theater screens. As a last attempt to keep him above water, he was paired up with legendary director John Woo and given an action-themed version ofThe Bodyguardas a vehicle. While the result isn't nearly as good as it ought to be, the movie remains a fun little time-waster and might be considered Lundgren's last hurrah as an action hero for several years.The story: after an incident in the line of duty leaves US Marshall-turned-bodyguard Jack Devlin (Lundgren) with a phobia of the color white, he's called to protect a drug-addicted supermodel (Kam Heskin,Pride & Prejudice) from an obsessed ex-husband out to assassinate her (Phillip MacKenzie,Hollywoodland).It's my opinion that John Woo should've stayed in Hong Kong. Sure,Face/Offwas good, but by large, the renowned auteur has been saddled with projects that either thoroughly hindered his unique style or made a mockery of it. ""Blackjack"" is one of these projects: while it's an out-of-the-ordinary excursion for Dolph, this is amateur hour for Woo, who more or less apes his own style by lazily pushing it so over the top that it ceases to be artistic and becomes comical. You get a full blast of this with virtually every other scene, whether it's Dolph dancing with his druggie quarry to detox her, bonding with his precocious young niece (Padraigin Murphy) for the sake of mushiness, slow motion shots galore, or the highlighting of the strange escapades of the weirdo villain - all of which could've been pulled off in a cool manner were Woo not being forced to the standards of American television. Speaking of the villain, Phillip MacKenzie's character more or less sums up everything that's wrong with John Woo's western work: he's written as an eccentric psychopath, half creepy and half artsy, but comes across as a complete farce of a Woo-style baddie as he quotes Othello, watches a butterfly trapped in a jar, and intimidates Jack by playing Russian roulette with a bunch of straw mannequins (okay, that last scene was kind of cool, but like everything else, it could've been so much more intense had it been handled more tactfully).On the bright side, this is definitely the most action Lundgren had and would see in a movie for several years. There's some karate, but for the most part, it's all about the big shootouts that the director is known for. There are three of these, and while Dolph ain't Chow Yun-Fat inHard Boiled, it's still cool to watch him leap through the air while firing from both hands with slow-motion explosions going off behind him. Halfway through the feature, there's a particularly standout scene in which Jack and his security caravan are attacked by machinegun-wielding motorcyclists in the woods and he starts blowing up the attackers' bikes underneath them. Again, Dolph won't be mistaken for a Hong Kong hero, but I'd argue that his gunfighting scenes with Woo were better than those Jean-Claude Van Damme got inHard Target.The production values are good, but the movie has a very superficial made-for-TV gloss to it. Acting is really hit & miss, seeing as Dolph does better than usual and Kam Heskin does okay, but Phillip MacKenzie and young Padraigin Murphy ham it up to particular excruciating levels. The whole color phobia angle is intriguing (if not fully exploited), and because of it, we get the once-in-a-lifetime scene of Dolph having a fight in a dairy factory and literally swimming in milk. The film is worth its cost just for scenes like this, but fans of both the star and the director ought to know that both of them can do much better.",3,"""Marshmallows. Big, fluffy clouds.

Jolliffe,"[5, 7]","John Woo the master of action directs this TV pilot and although its no where near the same league as some of his other films like Hard Boiled and the killer it is still a good action movie. Dolph Lundgren is good in the lead and gives one of his better performances, Woo is always able to get the best out of his stars except for Van Damme in Hard Target. The plot in this is pretty un-original and the inclusion of the phobia of white is far fetched but once an action scene pops up Woo's slick style comes to the fore front and is very impressive, his direction throughout the film is stylish and dispite the TV movie style look this does look quite expensive for a Dolph flick although  for a Woo film it does look cheap, but we still have Woo's trademark mass destruction with slo-mo debree flying through the air and every bullet seemingly having its own bullet hole. This needed another two main action scenes and a bit more depth in plot but the budget and time spent would not allow for that being a TV movie.

463961,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,6305428018,Richard Ross,"[2, 2]","Since I was the most impressed by Dolph Lundgren out of everyone in 'The Expendables', I wanted to see more of his work besides 'The Punisher', 'Universal Soldier' and 'Johnny Mneumonic'. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of starting with 'Blackjack'. John Woo directed this made-for-TV pilot about a former US Marshall (Lundgren) assigned to protect a pill popping supermodel from a psychotic stalker. Sounds like it could be fun, right? Wrong. The acting and writing is atrocious and - worst of all - the direction by the usually exciting Woo is lifeless. Since this was made-for-TV, there's no blood, no profanity, no nudity, no excitement. But these aren't what ultimately hurt the film, that would be the absurd plot.Early in the film - after a house shootout in which Dolph mows down a couple dozen bad guys - Lundgren gets temporarily blinded by an explosive device. In the aftermath of the explosion, he develops a bizarre phobia with the color white. Apparently this phobia has to do with the death of his father or something like that. Anyway, things get so bad that he has to wear shades all the time. Even with obstructed vision, he's still an expert marksman capable of hitting targets from great distances. As if he doesn't have his hands full what with his phobia and protecting a drug addicted floozy, he also becomes the legal guardian to a little girl whose parents died in a car crash. Dolph ain't exactly the nurturing type so parenting duties fall on his best friend/butler Thomas (character actor Saul Rubinek who is easily the highlight of the movie). Nothing real exciting happens while Dolph's on the job unless you count the scene where he saves the model after a suicide attempt by dancing feverishly for a couple of minutes before giving her a firm rubdown which results in some of the funniest ""oh faces"" I've ever seen outside of a cheesy soft-core romp. Dolph is also romancing his sexy therapist who's fond of making house calls. One important observation I made concerning Lundgren's ""phobia"" is that, even though he's paralyzed by the sight of a white deck of cards, he doesn't exactly recoil in terror when his therapist approaches him with her white bra clearly visible. All this excitement builds to the first inevitable showdown between Dolph and the assassin which takes place in a dairy full of  milk. That's right, one of the film's biggest action setpieces happens in a friggin' dairy. Really John?This ridiculous scene - one of many - would be easier to look past if the action sequences were actually fun. But they're not, they're just boring retreads of the epic shootouts in 'Face/Off' and the awesome motorcycle chases/explosions in 'MI:2'. We've seen it all before so why should we suffer through this slog if all the action sequences are just more of the same? The only thing I found clever about 'Blackjack' was the tagline on the DVD case which reads: ""He's just been dealt...a deadly hand.""
