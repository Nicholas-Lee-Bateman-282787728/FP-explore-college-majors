669732,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00005NQGQ,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 2]","Yeah, it's a little corny, and perhaps Edna Spalding (Sally Field) is a little too spunky, and Moze (Danny Glover) a little too saintly, but all in all, this is a very good movie. It's strengths more than make up for its weaknesses.It's the mid-1930s in Waxahachie, Texas. Edna's husband is a sheriff or a deputy (never got clear on that), who is killed by a drunken black teenager who thought he'd used up all the bullets before he turned the gun on Mr. Spalding. He was wrong. Dead wrong.Mr. Spalding's body is brought home, followed shortly by a truck full of rednecks dragging the body of the teenager behind them. They give the body back to his family by hanging it in a tree near their home. Nice people, eh?When Edna goes to the bank to learn how to write a check, she finds that there is very little money on deposit and a substantial mortgage payment is due in a few months. I don't remember the dollar figures, and they would be meaningless in these days compared to those, where Edna's sister is a hairdresser and charges 75 cents for a complete wash and set, maybe even a haircut as well.So with the help of Moze, who had just dropped buy for a meal-job, and a blind boarder (John Malkovich) forced upon her by the slimy banker, and her two very young but remarkably sturdy and uncomplaining children, she sets out to raise a crop of cotton on her land. She notices that much is made of the first bale ginned, and apparently it includes a $100 bonus. She knows nothing about cotton, but Moze grew up in a cotton field, and they literally work their hands bloody to bring in the crop.If you have to ask whether they succeed, you don't know Sally Field.There are several sub-plots about who is in love with whom, and so on, which I could not follow because the people all looked enough alike that I was never sure when the two-timer was with his wife or his mistress. He apparently loved both of them quite sincerely.What really makes this movie so good is the authenticity, down to the tiniest details. The Spalding house is a real one in the real Waxahachie, Texas. The life of the blind character John Malkovich plays (Mr. Will; is that his first name or his last name?) is so authentic it's hard to believe it was played by a man who really could see. He makes brooms and cane chair seats for a living, which was typical cottage industry for the blind in those years and for many years after. He gets around outdoors by a series of overhead ropes (doubtless also used for clothes lines) that can quickly lead him where he needs to go. And when the KKK pays a visit to rough up Moze, he recognizes each member's voice from having delivered brooms and caned chairs to them. He also has enough courage to scare off the bullies and save Moze's life.I feel it's that authenticity which gives the movie its heart. You really can be there among them, sharing their troubles and their triumphs, because you can believe they are real. If it weren't for the color and some well-known faces, you could believe you were watching a documentary made at the time of the story.",4,"Heartwarming, With Very Good Cast",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3075,"['Yeah', 'little', 'corny', 'perhaps', 'Edna', 'Spalding', 'Sally', 'Field', 'little', 'too', 'spunky', 'Moze', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'little', 'too', 'saintly', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'strengths', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'weaknesses.It', 'mid-1930s', 'Waxahachie', 'Texas', 'Edna', 'husband', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'never', 'got', 'clear', 'who', 'killed', 'drunken', 'black', 'teenager', 'who', 'thought', ""'d"", 'used', 'up', 'bullets', 'turned', 'gun', 'Mr.', 'Spalding', 'was', 'wrong', 'Dead', 'wrong.Mr', 'Spalding', 'body', 'brought', 'home', 'followed', 'shortly', 'truck', 'full', 'rednecks', 'dragging', 'body', 'teenager', 'give', 'body', 'back', 'family', 'hanging', 'tree', 'home', 'Nice', 'people', 'eh', 'When', 'Edna', 'bank', 'learn', 'how', 'write', 'check', 'very', 'little', 'money', 'deposit', 'substantial', 'mortgage', 'payment', 'due', 'few', 'months', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'dollar', 'figures', 'would', 'be', 'meaningless', 'days', 'compared', 'where', 'Edna', 'sister', 'hairdresser', '75', 'cents', 'complete', 'wash', 'set', 'maybe', 'even', 'haircut', 'well.So', 'help', 'Moze', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'dropped', 'buy', 'meal-job', 'blind', 'boarder', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'forced', 'slimy', 'banker', 'two', 'very', 'young', 'remarkably', 'sturdy', 'uncomplaining', 'children', 'out', 'raise', 'crop', 'cotton', 'land', 'much', 'made', 'first', 'bale', 'ginned', 'apparently', '100', 'bonus', 'nothing', 'cotton', 'Moze', 'grew', 'up', 'cotton', 'field', 'literally', 'work', 'hands', 'bloody', 'bring', 'crop.If', 'have', 'ask', 'succeed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Sally', 'Field.There', 'are', 'several', 'sub-plots', 'who', 'love', 'whom', 'so', 'could', 'not', 'follow', 'people', 'looked', 'enough', 'was', 'never', 'sure', 'when', 'two-timer', 'was', 'wife', 'mistress', 'apparently', 'loved', 'quite', 'sincerely.What', 'really', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'authenticity', 'down', 'tiniest', 'details', 'Spalding', 'house', 'real', 'one', 'real', 'Waxahachie', 'Texas', 'life', 'blind', 'character', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Mr.', 'Will', 'first', 'name', 'last', 'name', 'so', 'authentic', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'played', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'could', 'see', 'brooms', 'cane', 'chair', 'seats', 'living', 'was', 'typical', 'cottage', 'industry', 'blind', 'years', 'many', 'years', 'outdoors', 'series', 'overhead', 'ropes', 'doubtless', 'also', 'used', 'clothes', 'lines', 'can', 'quickly', 'lead', 'where', 'go', 'when', 'KKK', 'visit', 'rough', 'up', 'Moze', 'member', 'voice', 'having', 'delivered', 'brooms', 'caned', 'chairs', 'also', 'enough', 'courage', 'scare', 'off', 'bullies', 'save', 'Moze', 'life.I', 'feel', 'authenticity', 'movie', 'heart', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'there', 'sharing', 'troubles', 'triumphs', 'can', 'believe', 'are', 'real', 'were', ""n't"", 'color', 'well-known', 'could', 'believe', 'were', 'watching', 'documentary', 'made', 'time', 'story']",N/A

669734,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00005NQGQ,Bobby Underwood,"[8, 8]","This moving film from director Robert Benton brings to life a time and place as few films have ever done. Benton based this on his memories growing up and everything is authentic to the smallest detail. He shows the good and the bad of this area and era in small town Texas. Sally Field deservedly won the Oscar for her natural and poignant performance and Danny Glover is just as memorable.Waxahachie, Texas, in 1935 when jobs are scarce and justice often left in the hands of men hiding behind sheets is the setting for this tender look at times trying to change before people are ready to. Field is extraordinary as Edna Spaulding, finding she and her two children suddenly alone when her sheriff husband is killed by accident. She has no idea how to support her family and the bank wants her to sale her home and the land around it to pay off her mortgage. She is scared but determined to find a way to stay.Along comes Moses (Danny Glover) to suggest she use the small amount of land to plant cotton. It will give her enough to save her home and feed her children. But Moses is a black man in a time when a black man is suppose to keep his place. His advice to the innocent Edna prevents others from cheating her and gives her a fighting chance. It also angers those who cannot fathom a black man being smarter than they are.John Malkovich is terrific also as the blind boarder she takes in, who just happens to be the banker's brother-in-law. The three form a bond as they overcome every obstacle together and each helps out to form a makeshift family unit. Field gives a subtle performance as we see her loneliness for her husband and her love for her little boy Frank and his little sister Possum. The scene where she must now take over the disciplinary duties is particularly moving.The hardships of nature are shown as well when a storm suddenly appears out of nowhere and even more suddenly turns into a tornado. Edna barely has time to deal with her sister Margaret's (Lindsay Crouse) marital problems. Wayne (Ed Harris) is having an affair with his wife's best friend Viola (Amy Madigan). All the performances have a realistic feel, capturing perfectly life in a small Texas town during the depression.When Moses helps her make a go of it the racial hatred of the time is shown in a beating that will force him to leave or probably be killed. The scene between he and Edna near the end will surely tug at your heart and anger you at the same time. The anguish of Moses as he knows his time has not yet come is truly the most heartbreaking moment in the movie.This was a landmark film and not to be dismissed. Many have tried to copy this formula but this one is the real thing. The final scene is one you will never forget. This is a film you must own.",5,A Forgotten Gem,1217721600,"08 3, 2008",2008,2765,"['moving', 'film', 'director', 'Robert', 'Benton', 'life', 'time', 'place', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'Benton', 'based', 'memories', 'growing', 'up', 'everything', 'authentic', 'smallest', 'detail', 'good', 'bad', 'area', 'era', 'small', 'town', 'Texas', 'Sally', 'Field', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'natural', 'poignant', 'performance', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'just', 'memorable.Waxahachie', 'Texas', '1935', 'when', 'jobs', 'are', 'scarce', 'justice', 'often', 'left', 'hands', 'men', 'hiding', 'sheets', 'setting', 'tender', 'look', 'times', 'trying', 'change', 'people', 'are', 'ready', 'Field', 'extraordinary', 'Edna', 'Spaulding', 'finding', 'two', 'children', 'suddenly', 'alone', 'when', 'sheriff', 'husband', 'killed', 'accident', 'idea', 'how', 'support', 'family', 'bank', 'sale', 'home', 'land', 'pay', 'off', 'mortgage', 'scared', 'determined', 'find', 'way', 'stay.Along', 'Moses', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'suggest', 'use', 'small', 'amount', 'land', 'plant', 'cotton', 'will', 'give', 'enough', 'save', 'home', 'feed', 'children', 'Moses', 'black', 'man', 'time', 'when', 'black', 'man', 'suppose', 'keep', 'place', 'advice', 'innocent', 'Edna', 'prevents', 'others', 'cheating', 'fighting', 'chance', 'also', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'black', 'man', 'being', 'smarter', 'are.John', 'Malkovich', 'terrific', 'also', 'blind', 'boarder', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'banker', 'brother-in-law', 'three', 'form', 'bond', 'overcome', 'obstacle', 'together', 'out', 'form', 'makeshift', 'family', 'unit', 'Field', 'subtle', 'performance', 'see', 'loneliness', 'husband', 'love', 'little', 'boy', 'Frank', 'little', 'sister', 'Possum', 'scene', 'where', 'must', 'now', 'take', 'over', 'disciplinary', 'duties', 'particularly', 'moving.The', 'hardships', 'nature', 'are', 'shown', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'storm', 'suddenly', 'nowhere', 'even', 'more', 'suddenly', 'tornado', 'Edna', 'barely', 'time', 'deal', 'sister', 'Margaret', 'Lindsay', 'Crouse', 'marital', 'problems', 'Wayne', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'having', 'affair', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'Viola', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'performances', 'have', 'realistic', 'feel', 'capturing', 'perfectly', 'life', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'depression.When', 'Moses', 'make', 'go', 'racial', 'hatred', 'time', 'shown', 'beating', 'will', 'force', 'leave', 'probably', 'be', 'killed', 'scene', 'Edna', 'end', 'will', 'surely', 'tug', 'heart', 'anger', 'same', 'time', 'anguish', 'Moses', 'time', 'not', 'yet', 'come', 'truly', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'moment', 'movie.This', 'was', 'landmark', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'dismissed', 'Many', 'have', 'tried', 'copy', 'formula', 'one', 'real', 'thing', 'final', 'scene', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'film', 'must', 'own']",N/A

The sound is 2.0 surround and rather disappointing, suffering from a weak characteristic throughout. There are no extras to speak of.

A previous reviewer noted that the cinematography of Nestor Almendros was sorely missing an Oscar nomination, and this is most correct. There were three films in 1984 about &quot;saving the farm&quot; (&quot;Country&quot;, &quot;The River&quot; and this); though &quot;Country&quot; was released earlier and got better reviews, this one came along and blew 'em all out of the water. This was Benton's autobiographical account of life during hard times, and it couldn't be more lovingly presented. Then, again, there's the acting: Lindsay Crouse, Danny Glover, John Malkovich, Terry O'Quinn, Amy Irving, Ed Harris, and two absolutely wonderful kid-actors, Yankton Hatton &amp; Gennie James.

Sally won an academy award for best actress for her part in this film, which she very much deserves. She did one fantastic job of acting. So did the people who played the blind man and the black hired hand.Set in the Great Depression, it portrays people who are tender in their caring for others, very strong in their faith in God and gutsy in their refusal to quit when the going gets tough. In contrast it portrays an insensitive, greedy banker, who shortly after her husband's senseless killing encourages Edna Spalding (Sally Field) to sell her house to pay off the mortgage, go live with her sister and since she doesn't have room to house all of Edna's family, send one of her two children to live with relatives in another state. She bluntly turns down his offer, letting him know that she will find a way to get the mortgage money in on time.A black man named Mose's (Danny Grover) offer to help Edna grow cotton, while met with initial hesitation, undoubtedly influenced not only by the South's attitude toward blacks, but also by the fact that her husband was killed by a drunken black man is finally accepted. Edna is also coerced by the banker into housing his blind brother Will (John Malkovitch), which turns out to be a real blessing is disguise. Her black hired hand is also a Godsend. He proves to be worth his weight in gold and when the cotton harvest is in, the mortgage payment is more than met. The movie ends on a triumphant note, with blacks and whites setting next to each other in church, receiving communion. The Scripture text for the day is I Corinthians 13.

She takes in a very friendly black man (wonderfully played by Danny Glover) who helps her get and plant the cotton, and a smart blind man (played by John Malkovich in an Oscar-nominated performance) who's a paying boarder.These three adults and the two children form a little family together, and this is the part of &quot;Places in the Heart&quot; that works best.Other characters add to the story. Lindsey Crouse was also Oscar-nominated for her portrayl of Field's sister who comes to help out after tragedy strikes early on. Ed Harris plays Crouse's husband who's having an affair with another woman, which makes for a somewhat inessential subplot. But that's a minor grouse.Apart from the top-notch performances, the film's stunning finale is an unforgettable cinematic statement about hope. Had everyone in the room jerking a tear.On DVD the film doesn't really look like an old movie (1984) if that bothers you. A highly recommended gem for any collection!",4,"OF LOSS, LOVE AND HOPE",1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,1469,"['Few', 'movies', 'hit', 'so', 'unabashedly', 'heart', 'melodramatic', 'wallop', 'Benton', '8217', 's', 'Places', 'Heart', 'yet', 'manage', 'avoid', 'feeling', 'cheap', 'deeply', 'touching', 'slice', 'depression', 'era', 'worthy', 'Oscars', 'bagged', 'screenplay', 'best', 'actress', 'Fields', 'several', 'nominations.Sally', 'Field', 'weilds', 'absolute', 'acting', 'prowess', 'Edna', 'Spaulding', 'wife', 'mother', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'becomes', 'widowed', 'drunk', 'accidentally', 'husband', 'make', 'money', 'planting', 'cotton', 'very', 'friendly', 'black', 'man', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'who', 'get', 'plant', 'cotton', 'smart', 'blind', 'man', 'played', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'who', 'paying', 'boarder.These', 'three', 'adults', 'two', 'children', 'form', 'little', 'family', 'together', 'part', 'quot', 'Places', 'Heart', 'quot', 'best.Other', 'characters', 'add', 'story', 'Lindsey', 'Crouse', 'was', 'also', 'Oscar-nominated', 'portrayl', 'Field', 'sister', 'who', 'help', 'out', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'early', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Crouse', 'husband', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'woman', 'somewhat', 'inessential', 'subplot', 'minor', 'grouse.Apart', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'film', 'stunning', 'finale', 'unforgettable', 'cinematic', 'statement', 'hope', 'Had', 'everyone', 'room', 'jerking', 'tear.On', 'DVD', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'old', 'movie', '1984', 'highly', 'recommended', 'gem', 'collection']",N/A

669766,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,B00005NQGQ,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[5, 5]","PLACES IN THE HEART is an excellent movie that takes place in 1930's rural Texas.  The movie starts sadly with the tragic death of a sheriff who is also a husband and father.  Sally Fields is his widow, Edna, who is left to deal with an almost Biblical plague of difficulties and setbacks.  Fields' acting is great as she transforms from a woman who did not even know her husband's salary to one who can negotiate a deal with an unscrupulous cotton gin owner.  Danny Glover shows his acting skills as Mose a homeless drifter who miraculously comes to help her save her farm. And John Malkovich is amazing as the bitter blind man Mr. Will.  The subplot about Edna's beauty shop owning sister and her unfaithful husband was not as compelling and did not quite seem to belong in the same movie.The famous ending at the church during a communion service is very powerful no matter what the viewer's spiritual beliefs and leaves many in tears or with goosebumps.",5,I know this sounds corny but the movie really did win a special place in my heart,1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,957,"['PLACES', 'IN', 'HEART', 'excellent', 'movie', 'place', '1930', 'rural', 'Texas', 'movie', 'sadly', 'tragic', 'death', 'sheriff', 'who', 'also', 'husband', 'father', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'widow', 'Edna', 'who', 'left', 'deal', 'almost', 'Biblical', 'plague', 'difficulties', 'setbacks', 'Fields', 'acting', 'great', 'woman', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'husband', 'salary', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'negotiate', 'deal', 'unscrupulous', 'cotton', 'gin', 'owner', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'acting', 'skills', 'Mose', 'homeless', 'drifter', 'who', 'miraculously', 'help', 'save', 'farm', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'amazing', 'bitter', 'blind', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Will', 'subplot', 'Edna', 'beauty', 'shop', 'owning', 'sister', 'unfaithful', 'husband', 'was', 'not', 'compelling', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'seem', 'belong', 'same', 'movie.The', 'famous', 'ending', 'church', 'communion', 'service', 'very', 'powerful', 'matter', 'what', 'viewer', 'spiritual', 'beliefs', 'many', 'tears', 'goosebumps']",N/A

I loved the ole timey hymns that was sung in church, I remember going with my great-grandmother to church, and we sang those same hymns. This movie gives you a look at what it is like in the old days, and what hard work is. All the actors in this movie did a outstanding job! I loved the chemisty between Danny Glover, and Sally Field! Awesome!My parents, and my grandparents, and my great-grandparents, on both sides of my family grew up on farm land, tending the land, and working in the fields! They all know how hard it was back in those days! In this movie I admire Edna and Mose's courage, no matter how hard things got for them, they never gave up, they kept on until they reached their goal, they chose to be good, and live their life the right way, and I loved the way Mose treated Edna's children, and the young blind man. I loved the way Mose, and Edna included the young blind man in their life.I admire people who get beaten down by life, but then turn right around, and rise up to defeat the hardship, and sorrow, and win and overcome the bad times.
