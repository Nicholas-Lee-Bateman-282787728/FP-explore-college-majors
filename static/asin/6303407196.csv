But most of the film just seemed to be lacking in many ways. The plot is not particuly clever but then not many action films are. But at the end of it I just felt it was lacking, that there was something major missing from the film. My pick for the skydiving action film would have to go to drop zone.

""The Arrival"" and ""Terminal Velocity"" are equally the best films Charlie Sheen has ever done. His acting ability in Terminal Velocity is fantastic and the action sequences rival any of the ""great stunts"" films. Natashi Kinski is excellent as well and the chemistry between Sheen and her is reminiscent of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbet (albeit in modern times). Early on the film demonstrates creativity and hardcore action. The gun firing, explosions and fight scenes are so well done I'm surprised the film doesn't have more recognition.Sheen working at an airfield as a sky diving trainer becomes entangled with covert Russian operations against his will. The film places humor at the right moments with Sheen delivering sharp one liners. The villains ground the story with serious ruthlessness and convincing twists keep you guessing. It seems to this viewer that much effort was put into the making of the movie and it really pays off. To this day it contains some of the best in air action scenes. The rural backdrop adds a great flavor. Not to be missed.

Charlie Sheen showed he was well on his way to being successful playing comedic roles, as he's doing on television right now.Nastassja Kinski plays the typical new young macho-female role that introduced on screen in the past generation in which females beat up males. Give me a break! Anyway, I still liked her. James Gandolfini was the best of the villains, and also demonstrated how he was about ready to hit the big time, which he did on TV with The Sopranos. Christopher McDonald was another villain in here but was stupid, not fun to watch. He was angry all the time and his bleached hair looked ludicrous.There are a couple of outrageous action scenes in this film, most notably when an automobile with Sheen and Kinski still in it is dropped from an airplane!

It described a believable and interesting tale of a young girl who got entangled with the wrong people but was saved by an honest skydiver who really cared.  The idea of her faking her own death was intriguing and the way the deed was executed was brilliant.  On the negative end, it became less watchable as she and Ditch constantly went from arguing to flirting.  The acting of the antagonists was well-done.  They look like mobsters and act like mobsters moderately well.  At a few points in the movie, they seemed to be hard to tolerate, with their &quot;know it all&quot; attitude.  But, the last few action sequences in the movie were excellent.  After watching the movie, it seemed like a believable plot that really didn't stretch anything.
