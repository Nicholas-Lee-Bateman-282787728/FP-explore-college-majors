849071,A5B6P7PX0MZIF,B0002XEEAM,"Kyle Woodside ""KleWdSide""","[71, 74]","Denis Leary is angry. It's what he's best at. Being a cynical smart-ass with anger problems is his trademark. But it's funny as hell, to say the least. Along with Robin Williams, he maybe one of the most talented comedic actors currently working. Check out his emotional turn on the TV series on FX called ""Rescue Me,"" a dramedy about post-9/11 New York firefighters, which is easily one of the best shows on cable.""The Complete Denis Leary"" is the first time ever his comic shows have ever been released on DVD (finally!). It includes his two shows; ""No Cure for Cancer"" and ""Lock N Load."" ""No Cure for Cancer"" premiered on Showtime in 1991 where Leary rants on profanely and bitterly about musicians (ones he praised and despised), meat, cigarettes, drugs, hypocritical animal rights activists, life etc. It's hard to choose on what's the funniest bit since they're all hilarious and oh-so-true. ""Lock N Load"" is also enjoyable. It was an HBO special during 1997 where he has an obvious good time wickedly poking fun at Michael Flatley, Marv Albert, fat people, the Irish etc. While not quite as amusing as ""Cancer"" but it's still a good laugh. The long stretch where he goes on about how much his kids drive him nuts was probably the funniest bit.I really don't want to include any explicit desciptions on what he speaks of since it would really ruin your enjoyment on watching these. Just laugh and have a good time. But steer clear of Denis Leary if you're one of those uptight types who can't handle the truth and profanity because his humor is quite mean-spirited alot of the times.

849073,A21P8800ZGRGIP,B0002XEEAM,Miketheratguy,"[6, 7]","I'll start by saying that if you're a fellow Leary fan, you'll like this package- his two most famous standup routines in their entirety on one disc, as well as some supplemental extras. If that's what you want, you won't be disappointed.I however was, at least a little bit. The presentation is good- the concerts are in their entirety, uncensored, and look as good as when I first saw them on tv.But here's one big problem- there's no chapter skip function. This is one of the most common features of any dvd, and to not have them on this set is just inexcusable. There's no way to skip to your favorite Leary monologues or rants (and there's lots to pick from, so that sucks), but possibly worse, if you accidentally hit the skip button halfway through the concert, it ends and you're stuck forwarding for five minutes until you get back to where you were. These concerts are around an hour in length each, so to not be able to skip to favorite spots is a real drag. Don't get me wrong, this should definitely be watched in its entirety- but once you have, you'll have spots that you want to see again. I love the vicious titular rant of Lock 'N Load, but it's at the very end of the show so I had to forward for minutes at a time to watch it again. That's just a pain.The extras are pretty short too, without much more than what's advertised on the dvd package. It's okay- a music video here, a behind-the-scenes bit there, but there's not much substance or length to it. I'm not complaining, all of this stuff is nice to have, I just think the space could have been better used with, for example, his Comedy Channel roast, but that wouldn't have been contractually possible anyway.In all, it's still worth getting for sure. Denis is a hilarious man who harbors a lot of unrestrained anger for much of the same stuff I dislike, so it's good to throw him on and laugh with him. And it's great to have his two main concerts on one dvd. I just wish that those helpful chapter skips would have been there, and as a fan I guess I was hoping for some more supplemental material. But great buy nonetheless for Leary fans.",4,"Good, but with a couple flaws",1125705600,"09 3, 2005",2005,2118,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', ""'re"", 'fellow', 'Leary', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'like', 'package-', 'two', 'most', 'famous', 'standup', 'routines', 'entirety', 'one', 'disc', 'as', 'well', 'supplemental', 'extras', 'what', 'want', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.I', 'however', 'was', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'presentation', 'good-', 'concerts', 'are', 'entirety', 'uncensored', 'look', 'as', 'good', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'tv.But', 'here', 'one', 'big', 'problem-', 'chapter', 'skip', 'function', 'one', 'most', 'common', 'features', 'dvd', 'not', 'have', 'set', 'just', 'inexcusable', 'way', 'skip', 'favorite', 'Leary', 'monologues', 'rants', 'lots', 'pick', 'sucks', 'possibly', 'worse', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'skip', 'button', 'halfway', 'concert', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'forwarding', 'five', 'minutes', 'get', 'back', 'where', 'were', 'concerts', 'are', 'hour', 'length', 'so', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'skip', 'favorite', 'spots', 'real', 'drag', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'watched', 'entirety-', 'once', 'have', ""'ll"", 'have', 'spots', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'love', 'vicious', 'titular', 'rant', 'Lock', 'N', 'Load', 'very', 'end', 'show', 'so', 'had', 'forward', 'minutes', 'time', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'pain.The', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'short', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'advertised', 'dvd', 'package', 'okay-', 'music', 'video', 'here', 'behind-the-scenes', 'bit', 'there', 'not', 'much', 'substance', 'length', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'stuff', 'nice', 'have', 'just', 'think', 'space', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'used', 'example', 'Comedy', 'Channel', 'roast', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'contractually', 'possible', 'anyway.In', 'still', 'worth', 'getting', 'sure', 'Denis', 'hilarious', 'man', 'who', 'lot', 'unrestrained', 'anger', 'much', 'same', 'stuff', 'dislike', 'good', 'throw', 'great', 'have', 'two', 'main', 'concerts', 'one', 'dvd', 'just', 'wish', 'helpful', 'chapter', 'skips', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'fan', 'guess', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'supplemental', 'material', 'great', 'buy', 'nonetheless', 'Leary', 'fans']","The Complete Denis Leary: No Cure for Cancer, Lock n' Load, and More"
