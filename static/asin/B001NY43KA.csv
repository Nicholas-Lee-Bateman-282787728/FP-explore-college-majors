While it was beautifully photographed I kind of felt I wasted time watching it.  I love foreign films but this one is mediocre.  Its not because of the sex.  Its because, (and I know I will get pelted for this but its my opinion) it really is just soft porn.The storyline was weak and the mysticism was an excuse to show naked young people.  I don't care if sex is in a movie as long as its relevant to the storyline and not overkill.  Would the audience appreciate the ""beautiful coming of age story"" if the stars were lumpy and out of shape?  (A young Jack Black...zoinks shiver me timbers!)I'm sorry to disagree with everyone but I did give it a try.  I started watching it wanting to like it.  I wanted to identify with the character because as it was advertised I saw some parallels with my own life. (Lost my father not so long ago, met my second husband not long afterward in a way that could only be described as fateful) Yet in the end I felt let down.  The attempt to be deep was lost.The only time I experienced true depth was at the end when Eloy's father appeared to him and told him life is about saying goodbye but don't let that stop you from living.  That to me was what the film was supposed to be about and yet it ventured off down the road of positions and thrusts.In any case just my two cents worth, not trying to offend anyone.",3,Don't Look Down,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,1396,"['guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'too', 'old', 'enjoy', 'film', 'was', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'kind', 'felt', 'wasted', 'time', 'watching', 'love', 'foreign', 'films', 'one', 'mediocre', 'not', 'sex', 'know', 'will', 'get', 'pelted', 'opinion', 'really', 'just', 'soft', 'porn.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'weak', 'mysticism', 'was', 'excuse', 'show', 'naked', 'young', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'sex', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'relevant', 'storyline', 'not', 'overkill', 'Would', 'audience', 'appreciate', 'beautiful', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'stars', 'were', 'lumpy', 'shape', 'young', 'Jack', 'Black', 'shiver', 'timbers', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'disagree', 'everyone', 'did', 'give', 'try', 'started', 'watching', 'wanting', 'like', 'wanted', 'identify', 'character', 'was', 'advertised', 'saw', 'parallels', 'own', 'life', 'Lost', 'father', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'met', 'second', 'husband', 'not', 'long', 'afterward', 'way', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'fateful', 'Yet', 'end', 'felt', 'let', 'down', 'attempt', 'be', 'deep', 'was', 'lost.The', 'only', 'time', 'experienced', 'true', 'depth', 'was', 'end', 'when', 'Eloy', 'father', 'appeared', 'told', 'life', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'living', 'was', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'yet', 'ventured', 'off', 'road', 'positions', 'thrusts.In', 'case', 'just', 'two', 'cents', 'worth', 'not', 'trying', 'offend', 'anyone']",Don't Look Down
1221206,A3JW06DZ1S5E2H,B001NY43KA,Daniel B.,"[0, 0]","What I know about the film maker Eliseo Subiela is summed up, no, exhausted by the titles of two films, this one under review, and an earlier one, known in English as Man Facing Southeast. About that earlier film I have only superlatives. It stunned me the first time I saw it. It was so wonderful that I watched it a second time the next morning before returning it to the video rental. Presently, however, that film is only available in a Spanish-only release, in other words, no subtitles. I was heartened then to see this later film - with subtitles - available through Amazon. Don't Look Down is not on the same high level of imagination and execution as Man Facing Southeast. but I hasten to add, What other film is? That film was a blessed creation, and it confers grace upon those who and participate in it. It has the same sweetness and beauty and triumph that characterizes Elephant Man in David Lynch's collected films.However, that said, I still rate Don't Look Down very highly. It is a Coming of Age story. The central character, an adolescent boy, is facing a double crisis in his life, which is the nexus of Death and Sex. His father has suddenly died which throws him into confusion, but happily he meets an older woman who initiates him into the pleasure and responsibility of sexual union. Note that second word - responsibility. This is not about casual sex, pleasure for pleasure's sake. It is about the role of sexual knowledge inthe growth of an individual to maturity, about its role in the development of his personality. The situation is clearly Freudian: there is a death wish and a life instinct. Which one will prevail? I am not giving away plot details in telling you it is the life instinct, literally embodied in sexual union, which triumphs. This film has a winningly positive tone throughout. The scenes of sexuality are suffused with tenderness, respect and good humor. I felt refreshed and restored each time I have watched it . . . Try to find a copy of Man Facing Southeast as well.

1221207,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001NY43KA,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[87, 87]","This is a tender love story between a young 19 year old inexperienced boy Eloy and a wise 28 year old woman Elvira. Eloy's father has died and he begins sleepwalking. His brother sets traps for him so that he will wake up and stop sleepwalking. Instead Eloy walks the roofs off buildings and eventually falls into Elvira's bed through her open skylight. From there the whole sexual awakening and teaching happens. Eventually they fall deeply in love and the story ends happily ever after.In a way, this sounds like a wonderful, sweet movie that most would enjoy. Sadly, it's pretty far from what happens in the film. The viewer is treated to some pretty awful film techniques, needless slow motion, bad editing, over use of tracking shots, and just plain poor story telling.To read the marketing description a person would think this is a treatise on the Kama Sutra and Tantric. It is so not that at all. Yes there are very very intimate scenes, these two lovers are very handsome without their clothes on. But an exploration of these two techniques? What we are treated to is a count down by Elvira. How many times can Eloy thrust before his nirvana? We see this scene played over and over again with Eloy becoming obsessed with that count - he has to reach 81! The pay off is him being mentally transported to a new city whenever he's reached between 80 and 100. This is no joke, that's exactly what is said in the film.The film is supposed to have some mystic level. Eloy communicates with his dead father. He rides his bike through a cemetary every day and the dead line up doing hand motions to him, which, well, vaguely resemble the motion of self pleasuring. The Grandmother is some mystic able to see auras arounnd people. And Eloy and Elvira seem to have some mystic ESP connection. Frankly, it kind of all boils down to a pretext to see these two lovely people in bed. Of which there is roughly 1/3 of the film at this state, beautifully photographed.The film is all about expectations. It is very far from a study of the Kama Sutra or the art of Tantra. Nobody will learn anything from what is in this film (there are many more infintitely more educational films than this one). If the viewer expects some elementary exploration of mystic ideas, a semi-sweet coming of age / love story, and doesn't mind intimate movies then they may well love this film. It was a bit too sophomoric for me.The film is not rated by the MPAA. It has an R rating in Canada. As noted, roughly 1/3 of the film is of two people naked, making love or talking about love making, with full frontal nudity. There are no views of penetration or a male losing his seed (to quote the film). There's no violence.
