Wautier ""boulonman""","[0, 0]","Being a recovering meth addict myself(Coming up on a decade of sobriety thanks to the compassion and professional help I received from several gifted professionals.) I can vouch for the very accurate portrayal of todays street drug scene this show presents us. The dynamics of the relationships between Mr. White aka: ""Heisenberg"" and a very hip smooth talking JesDoctersie who has to fight the daily temptation of relapsing.)  and Mike a senior citizen hitman who takes Jessie under his wing makes up for a extremely captivating show. The last season's finale episode shows Skyler asking Walt to come with her,  they end up in a storage yard where she had rented a XXL storage unit unbeknownst to anybody because there was no more room under the house! She suddenly yanks the tarp off a huge pile the size of a Honda civic revealing a huge mountain of thousands of  stacked 100$ bills (each banded with a tag denominating 10.000$ each!) They both stare at it dumbfounded, and Walt asks: ""What does all that amount to?"" Skyler shakes her head and replies: ""I have no earthly idea!"" What a classic scene!!!!! My mouth watered at the thought of even being close to that much money in reality!  She also claims: "" I tried counting it but it was coming in faster than she could count, even using those cool machines that shuffle hundred dollar bills in a blur and spits them out banded in 10.000$ bricks! ""Then I tried weighing them because any US bill regardless of denomination weighs exactly 1 gram (Nice factoid!) but I couldn't find a scale big enough to fit this monster on!"" Another classic line! And that is pretty much how the whole show goes, guns, mexican cartel, blue ice crystal meth/99.8% pure which is unheard of. (In reality, you're lucky if you can find anything purer than 80% and bathtub meth-cooks are all amateurs that end up using chemicals that are highly poisonous, which is why that shit tears you up in less than a decade! Google: ""Faces of Meth"" and try not to puke!!)There can be only one logical ending to this show: either Walt cancer comes back just when he finally decides to pull the plug and retire in luxury. Or Hank (his stereotypical gung-ho D.E.A brother-in-law>) finally puts all the clues together and ends up shooting him or locking him up forever. One thing's for sure, Bryan Cranston absolutely nails his character to a ""T""! A mild mannered high school chemistry teacher who transforms into a ruthless drug kingpin and becomes the legendary ""Heisenberg"" !!!!!  I could not wait for AMC to play season 5, I ended up buying the whole season in one shot and it was the best money/""fun-factor"" return I ever made. I'm praying they film another season! If not, that would be like ""coitus interruptus!!"" Definitely a 5 star plus, unless you have been living in a cave the last century and don't have a clue about our ever growing drug culture, and the governmental farce known as the D.E.A !!!  (Didn't it occur to the powers to be to look back at our own history and recall what a monumental disaster the Prohibition ended up being, not to mention it gave us those lovable characters such as Al Capone, John Dillinger, Baby face Nelson and the rise of the Mafia which is still alive and well, running everything right under our noses. You can be sure the government gets their cut as well!! Actually, the characters of Mr. White and the circle of scumbags he deals with, actually look quite mild mannered compared to the elected politicians who blatantly stuff thier pockets with our tax money at the same time they spew out empty promises and point fingers at the everybody but themselves!!!  But, I digress...This is one hell of a show and I highly recommend trying to start from the very first episode to get the full impact of Walt's ""Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde"" transformation!!!!!!peace out,  alanwautier@cox.net",5,Riveting and Realistic!,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,3855,"['Being', 'recovering', 'meth', 'addict', 'Coming', 'up', 'decade', 'sobriety', 'thanks', 'compassion', 'professional', 'help', 'received', 'several', 'gifted', 'professionals', 'can', 'vouch', 'very', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'todays', 'street', 'drug', 'scene', 'show', 'dynamics', 'relationships', 'Mr.', 'White', 'Heisenberg', 'very', 'hip', 'smooth', 'talking', 'JesDoctersie', 'who', 'fight', 'daily', 'temptation', 'relapsing', 'Mike', 'senior', 'citizen', 'hitman', 'who', 'Jessie', 'wing', 'up', 'extremely', 'captivating', 'show', 'last', 'season', 'finale', 'episode', 'Skyler', 'asking', 'Walt', 'come', 'end', 'up', 'storage', 'yard', 'where', 'had', 'rented', 'XXL', 'storage', 'unit', 'unbeknownst', 'anybody', 'was', 'more', 'room', 'house', 'suddenly', 'tarp', 'huge', 'pile', 'size', 'Honda', 'civic', 'revealing', 'huge', 'mountain', 'thousands', 'stacked', '100', 'bills', 'banded', 'tag', 'denominating', '10.000', 'stare', 'dumbfounded', 'Walt', 'What', 'amount', 'Skyler', 'shakes', 'head', 'replies', 'have', 'earthly', 'idea', 'What', 'classic', 'scene', 'mouth', 'watered', 'thought', 'even', 'being', 'close', 'much', 'money', 'reality', 'also', 'tried', 'counting', 'was', 'coming', 'faster', 'could', 'count', 'even', 'using', 'cool', 'machines', 'shuffle', 'hundred', 'dollar', 'bills', 'blur', 'spits', 'out', 'banded', '10.000', 'bricks', 'Then', 'tried', 'weighing', 'US', 'bill', 'regardless', 'denomination', 'weighs', 'exactly', '1', 'gram', 'Nice', 'factoid', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'scale', 'big', 'enough', 'fit', 'monster', 'classic', 'line', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'whole', 'show', 'guns', 'mexican', 'cartel', 'blue', 'ice', 'crystal', 'meth/99.8', '%', 'pure', 'unheard', 'reality', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'can', 'find', 'anything', 'purer', '80', '%', 'bathtub', 'meth-cooks', 'are', 'amateurs', 'end', 'up', 'using', 'chemicals', 'are', 'highly', 'poisonous', 'why', 'shit', 'tears', 'up', 'less', 'decade', 'Google', 'Faces', 'Meth', 'try', 'not', 'puke', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'logical', 'ending', 'show', 'Walt', 'cancer', 'back', 'just', 'when', 'finally', 'pull', 'plug', 'retire', 'luxury', 'Hank', 'stereotypical', 'gung-ho', 'D.E.A', 'brother-in-law', '>', 'finally', 'clues', 'together', 'up', 'shooting', 'locking', 'up', 'forever', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'absolutely', 'character', 'T', 'mild', 'mannered', 'high', 'school', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'who', 'ruthless', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'legendary', 'Heisenberg', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'AMC', 'play', 'season', '5', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'whole', 'season', 'one', 'shot', 'was', 'best', 'money/', 'fun-factor', 'return', 'ever', 'made', ""'m"", 'praying', 'film', 'season', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'coitus', 'interruptus', 'Definitely', '5', 'star', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'cave', 'last', 'century', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'ever', 'growing', 'drug', 'culture', 'governmental', 'farce', 'known', 'D.E.A', 'Did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'powers', 'be', 'look', 'back', 'own', 'history', 'recall', 'what', 'monumental', 'disaster', 'Prohibition', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'not', 'mention', 'gave', 'lovable', 'characters', 'such', 'Al', 'Capone', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'Baby', 'face', 'Nelson', 'rise', 'Mafia', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'running', 'everything', 'right', 'noses', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'government', 'cut', 'as', 'well', 'Actually', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'White', 'circle', 'scumbags', 'actually', 'look', 'quite', 'mild', 'mannered', 'compared', 'elected', 'politicians', 'who', 'blatantly', 'stuff', 'thier', 'pockets', 'tax', 'money', 'same', 'time', 'spew', 'out', 'empty', 'promises', 'point', 'fingers', 'everybody', 'digress', 'one', 'hell', 'show', 'highly', 'recommend', 'trying', 'start', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'get', 'full', 'impact', 'Walt', 'Doctor', 'Jekyll', 'Mister', 'Hyde', 'transformation', 'peace', 'alanwautier', '@', 'cox.net']",N/A

1506616,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B0060MYKYY,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 2]","The final (and fifth) season of BREAKING BAD consists of sixteen episodes (most previous years had thirteen).  Because marketing managers and not television producers call the shots in terms of DVD production, this final season was cut into two:  ""Season Five"" here consists of episodes 1 through 8.  Some merry marketeers call episodes 9 - 16 ""Season 6""; others use the grandiose and equally misleading ""Final Season."" Upshot: I have no option but to review episodes 9 - 16 separately because they were put on a separate DVD.(Spoiler Alerts):  These eight episodes are wonderful and reach a grandeur seldom achieved in television drama.  Once again, Walter White has lost his profession of top-notch crystal-meth cooker and violent (though, we like to believe, unwilling) gangster, without quite getting caught.  Amazingly, the plot dexterously keeps DEA brother-in-law Hank from quite catching on.  For Walt to be without a crystal-meth empire is to largely forego his identity, so he reaches out to the German conglomerate, which, having lost Gus Fring, is ready to deal.  More  efficient international connections provide vastly more money but this windfall is  counterbalanced by wife Skyler's increasing alienation from her husband and the depression that goes with it, and also the need for Walt to find a new way to get hold of an expensive key ingredient in meth-making.  Lesser people than Walt start to fall apart, notably Jesse Pinkman, who occasionally escapes from his own depression to show his true loose-cannon potential.I really like the dialog in these episodes.  From that point of view, my favorite episode is number 7 of Season 5 (no. 53 overall), ""Say My Name,"" during which the physical violence abates briefly and the players come to terms with each other.  I predict some of this dialog will have a future in dramatic readings for years to come:Walter White: I know all about your operation. My partners here tell me that you produce a meth that's 70% pure, if you're lucky. What I produce is 99.1% pure.Declan: So?Walter White: So... it's grade school tee-ball vs. The New York Yankees. Yours is just some tepid... off-brand, generic cola. What I'm making is classic Coke.Declan: All right. Okay. So, um... If we just waste you right here, right now, and leave you in the desert then there is no more coke on the market, right? See how that works? There's only us.Walter White: Do you really wanna live in a world without Coca-Cola?Even so, the show still has room for some of its legendary musical wit:  the last episode on this disc, ""Gliding Over All,"" puts Tommy James' 1969 bubblegum classic, ""Crystal Blue Persuasion,"" on the soundtrack.  This ditty, when written, had nothing to do with drugs but may now establish an indelible connection to Walter White's crystal-blue meth and the persuasive power of money.Obviously, if you've come this far in the BREAKING BAD saga there's no reason to stop now, but if you're like me you resent the artificial divison of the last year so that two DVD purchases are required rather than one.

Thus, the kids are still at Marie's but Junior is fighting the new regime and is demanding uncomfortable answers, but that brings everything together for the set-piece which is a train robbery for methylamine, the chemical required to make methamphetamine.Mike, ever the pragmatist, states early on that there are two kinds of heists, those where the crew gets away with it and those where they leave witnesses. The guys need to make a choice about killing the two innocent men who are driving the train. In typical fashion, the guys come up with a plan that won't involve witnesses, if everything goes well the engineer and conductor won't even see them. As an aside, the plan is Jesse's, a young man who is poignantly coming into his own and the viewer fervently wishes that it were in anything other than crime. I would have preferred the guys to make the choice to either kill or not rob the train as I think that would have been truer to the arc of the characters and the realism of the show but the fact that nobody except Mike wants to admit that they are criminals and killers, not just guys cooking a little meth for money is true to the characters as well.As usual, things don't go quite as planned and a choice about witnesses is made, but this choice and the cliffhanger that results from it feels a bit contrived to highlight the moral choices (or immoral choices) that Walt and Jesse now face, but the choice about the railroad employees was just as telling and less melodramatic. The heist itself is brilliantly conceived and a lot of fun to watch. All in all a good set-piece and it will be interesting to see if something as yet unknown about the train heist trips the guys later.

1506703,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B0060MYKYY,D. C. Obraztsov,"[20, 23]","Breaking Bad has been a gem ever since season one, yet it somehow manages to surpass itself in qualify every season.  This has become undoubtedly one of the finest hours in television drama history, rivaling some of the big timers such as The Sopranos and The Wire (and yes, I've seen them both multiple times).  A friend told me this show is about a good man becoming evil.  I would say this show is about a man that has always been extremely intelligent, resourceful, yet heavily underutilized and bitter for his underachievement of things in life, which has taken him down a greedy and disturbing road.  Whether it's almost getting rich from Gray Matter Technologies or being ""outdone"" by Hank in looking cool and successful, especially in front of his son, Walter White has been bitter from the very beginning.In the first few seasons, Walt had many, many moments of vulnerability while trying to just make enough cash for his family to live on after he died.  Remember the plate guy from season one?  Walt had to think long and hard before making a decision, and it appeared to hang heavy on his moral conscience.  Over time, however, I believe Walt has realized that this monster had been lurking within him all along, and when that revelation appeared - he embraced it and evolved into it over time.  Walt isn't dorky Walter White anymore, but has fully transformed into Heisenberg.  Season one plate guy wouldn't even cause a moment of moral dilemma for this man now, and this has become much more about just making enough money for his family and quickly getting out, but now it's more about power, greed, and building an ""empire,"" like Walt says himself.  He has successfully become one of the best antiheroes in television history.Although it's difficult to give a very in-depth review considering this is only half of one season, the first eight episodes were more than enough to tell me that this show is back and better than ever.  It's always an hour of non-stop tension, heartache, horror, empathy, and fun.  Almost all of the characters are morally ambiguous, which always makes for a more interesting experience for the viewer as well, who is left to make their own judgments of characters, rather than be spoon fed what the writers want them to feel.A great example is Mike Ehrmantraut (played by the very talented Jonathan Banks), who is a cold-blooded hitman and grandfather of the year.  His slyness, intelligence, and completely badass characteristics, along with his occasional kindness and empathy (especially toward Jesse) and relationship with his granddaughter makes him an easy to like character.  It's almost easy to forget sometimes that he was Gus Fring's hitman; a killer that will kill whoever is asked of him without question.Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman won an Emmy for last year's performance, which is highly unsurprising.  This year, more than ever, we see how Jesse is becoming one of the most morally pure characters on the show, even though he's committed some cold-blooded acts of murder himself.  Paul is one of television's best young actors, and his portrayal of Jesse is riveting, funny, complex, and heartbreaking.The cast has amazing chemistry together, and being able to see Walt, Jesse, Mike, and Saul work together again at the beginning of the season is just pure fun.  We also have a new character this season, Lydia, who was one Gus' guys, and she stirs up a lot of trouble.  You never know if she is being honest or completely full of it.  Anna Gunn as Skyler White is amazing as ever, and even though Skyler is somewhat of a hated character, that means Gunn is doing her job well.  She is another morally ambiguous character, with some people thinking she is completely unfair and annoying towards Walt, while others support her wholeheartedly.  When there is so much division on issues such as this among fans, you know it's a good show.  Dean Norris as Hank Schrader, who I think deserves more credit for his part, definitely plays a very important part this season, with everyone wondering - is he going to figure out that Heisenberg = Walt?  Walt stoops to some all time lows this season, including manipulating Hank to help his meth business.Someone without any interest in character studies or development could simply love this show for the action and grittiness, and a psychologist could love it for its successful combination of both.  This is one of the very few shows that has ever been able to incorporate non-stop action into a show that has deeply complex characters that viewers truly care about.  Vince Gilligan has proven that he knows how to make great television, and with only eight episodes remaining in this saga, I can only hope that it continues to live up to what it's been so far.",5,"Shockingly gets better, darker, and has become one of the finest hours in television history.",1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,4762,"['Breaking', 'Bad', 'been', 'gem', 'ever', 'season', 'one',

The characters are polarizing to watch and very realistically edgy in their portrayals.

There aren't unrealistic television reality stars to be found on this show.  We get 40-45 minutes per episode of very well written mixtures of comedy, suspense, and drama which most shows cannot do alone.  Let alone be consistently good without an off episode.  I said it in my previous review of Breaking Bad and I'll say it again; Breaking Bad will forever change how television shows approach making characters.  By that, I mean these characters are real.  Past shows like The Shield, Justified, and others have done great work leading into this new type of television realism.  Breaking Bad takes everything that came before it and damn near makes it obsolete.  Vince Gilligan is the master of writing and his stuff on this show is top notch quality that will be remembered for years to come.

Viewership was up sharply for these eight episodes originally broadcast on AMC in the summer of 2012--the decision was made to split the final season into two parts, and this DVD set contains the first half of Season Five.These episodes see more outstanding writing and plot twists--Walter (Bryan Cranston), Jesse (Aaron Paul), and the other characters at times want to break free of each other and from their life of crime but are unable to do so.  Walt's pride makes several more appearances, as he is clinging to the meth business as a means of reversing past life defeats.As has been the case throughout, Walt's relationships with the other characters have their ups and downs, and the amusing cliffhanger of these episodes points toward the final resolution in the last episodes of the series.  And as always, there are the scenic shots of the New Mexico desert that provide a superb setting for &#34;Breaking Bad.&#34;Special features on this DVD set include brief commentary by series creator Vince Gilligan and some of the lead characters.

1506738,A17PNW5KFXRDT3,B0060MYKYY,fsnva,"[1, 1]","Most TV series usually hit a speed bump by their fifth season as creative exhaustion begins to set in, but not BREAKING BAD; after a spectacular 4th season that culminated with the final (and literal) face off with Gus Fring, Vince Gilligan and company upped the ante and took the story of Walter White to heights heretofore unseen by their own, or any other show's, standards.In season five, chemistry teacher turned meth cook, Walter White has finally reached the top of his chosen profession.  And with his partners, Jesse and Mike, Walter now plans to make millions free from the fear of drug lords like the now deceased Gus and Tuco.  But Walter learns, as everyone does, that being the boss is a lot harder job than it looks, for there are constant crises to resolve among partners, suppliers, former associates, family and the law in the person of his brother in law, Hank, a DEA agent now in charge of the Albuquerque office.  Dogged Hank is trying to tie up the loose ends from the Gus Fring investigation and keeps edging closer to learning Walter's secret.No matter, Walter is a man who thrives on challenge and for every problem or setback, there is a solution, even if it means coming up with a scheme to drain a tank car on a train of desperately needed methylamine or orchestrate the mass murder of a bunch of potential snitches in lockup.  Is there anything left to salvage in this man's soul?  Faithful viewers will be pondering this question as each episode of season 5 leaves ever more mayhem, both physical and emotional, in its wake.  The episode titled ""Dead Freight"" contains a heist sequence worthy of Hitchcock, but ends on an act so heinous and despicable that even die hard fans will be shocked.Bryan Cranston's acting has made Walter White a true contender for the greatest character in TV history, right along side Archie Bunker, Lucy Ricardo, and Tony Soprano.  To me his standout scene has to be when he explains why he does not want to take the buyout offer Mike has arranged and we learn something vital as to what makes this character tick.  All due praise should be given to Aaron Paul's Jesse, whose conscience is starting to wear down to the raw by his long partnership with Walt.  Then there is Dean Norris as Hank, who is far from the buffoon we first thought he was back in season 1; instead he has become  the only moral adult in sight.  Bob Odenkirk is back as Saul Goodman, perhaps the most corrupt lawyer in TV history.  And we really wonder what will happen when and if RJ Mitte's Walt Jr. learns the truth about his parents.Special praise to Anna Gunn as Skylar, whose character seems to be barely holding it together as she runs the car wash and launders the drug money her husband wheels in.  Many viewers hate Gunn's character and the writer's do her no favor, but watching Gunn's acting as Skylar burns from the inside is a real treat.But the breakout performance in season 5 is Jonathan Banks's Mike Eharmentraut, Gus Fring's former security chief and now Walt's wary (to say the least) partner.  With his deadpan delivery and steely glare, Mike is not to be messed with and his sparring with Walt is the highlight of the season.  Banks has been around a long time (I remember him on WISEGUY many years ago)and this was the role of a lifetime, making us actually feel sorry for this ruthless thug when things get tight.There are a couple of new characters in Jesse Plemons's Todd and Laura Fraser's Lydia, the ultimate corporate weasel.  Larry Hankins makes a brief return as Old Joe, the junkyard owner who once again helps Walt and company out of a jam.I'll never be able to hear ""Chrystal Blue Persuasion"" by Tommy James and the Shondells again and not think of BREAKING BAD. One of the best uses of an oldie ever.How will it all end?  We are given a clue in the season opener's first scene and it does not look good; especially after the twist in the final scene of ""Gliding Over All,"" the season's climax, which sets up a showdown that has been in the making since the first show.  But no one should underestimate Walter White, many have and many have died.",5,No slump in season 5.,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,4113,"['Most', 'TV', 'series', 'usually', 'hit', 'speed', 'bump', 'fifth', 'season', 'creative', 'exhaustion', 'set', 'not', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'spectacular', '4th', 'season', 'culminated', 'final', 'literal', 'face', 'Gus', 'Fring', 'Vince', 'Gilligan', 'company', 'upped', 'ante', 'took', 'story', 'Walter', 'White', 'heights', 'heretofore', 'unseen', 'own', 'other', 'show', 'standards.In', 'season', 'five', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'turned', 'meth', 'cook', 'Walter', 'White', 'finally', 'reached', 'top', 'chosen', 'profession', 'partners', 'Jesse', 'Mike', 'Walter', 'now', 'make', 'millions', 'free', 'fear', 'drug', 'lords', 'now', 'deceased', 'Gus', 'Tuco', 'Walter', 'everyone', 'being', 'boss', 'lot', 'harder', 'job', 'are', 'constant', 'crises', 'resolve', 'partners', 'suppliers', 'former', 'associates', 'family', 'law', 'person', 'brother', 'law', 'Hank', 'DEA', 'agent', 'now', 'charge', 'Albuquerque', 'office', 'Dogged', 'Hank', 'trying', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Gus', 'Fring', 'investigation', 'edging', 'closer', 'learning', 'Walter', 'secret.No', 'matter', 'Walter', 'man', 'who', 'challenge', 'problem', 'setback', 'solution', 'even', 'coming', 'up', 'scheme', 'drain', 'tank', 'car', 'train', 'desperately', 'needed', 'methylamine', 'orchestrate', 'mass', 'murder', 'bunch', 'potential', 'snitches', 'lockup', 'there', 'anything', 'left', 'salvage', 'man', 'soul', 'Faithful', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'pondering', 'question', 'episode', 'season', '5', 'ever', 'more', 'mayhem', 'physical', 'emotional', 'wake', 'episode', 'titled', 'Dead', 'Freight', 'heist', 'sequence', 'worthy', 'Hitchcock', 'act', 'so', 'heinous', 'despicable', 'even', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'shocked.Bryan', 'Cranston', 'acting', 'made', 'Walter', 'White', 'true', 'contender', 'greatest', 'character', 'TV', 'history', 'right', 'side', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'Lucy', 'Ricardo', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'standout', 'scene', 'be', 'when', 'why', 'not', 'want', 'take', 'buyout', 'offer', 'Mike', 'arranged', 'learn', 'something', 'vital', 'what', 'character', 'tick', 'due', 'praise', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'Jesse', 'conscience', 'starting', 'wear', 'down', 'raw', 'long', 'partnership', 'Walt', 'Then', 'Dean', 'Norris', 'Hank', 'who', 'far', 'buffoon', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'back', 'season', '1', 'instead', 'become', 'only', 'moral', 'adult', 'sight', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'back', 'Saul', 'Goodman', 'perhaps', 'most', 'corrupt', 'lawyer', 'TV', 'history', 'really', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'RJ', 'Mitte', 'Walt', 'Jr.', 'truth', 'parents.Special', 'praise', 'Anna', 'Gunn', 'Skylar', 'character', 'be', 'barely', 'holding', 'together', 'car', 'wash', 'drug', 'money', 'husband', 'wheels', 'Many', 'viewers', 'hate', 'Gunn', 'character', 'writer', 'do', 'favor', 'watching', 'Gunn', 'acting', 'Skylar', 'burns', 'inside', 'real', 'treat.But', 'breakout', 'performance', 'season', '5', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'Mike', 'Eharmentraut', 'Gus', 'Fring', 'former', 'security', 'chief', 'now', 'Walt', 'wary', 'say', 'least', 'partner', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'steely', 'glare', 'Mike', 'not', 'be', 'messed', 'sparring', 'Walt', 'highlight', 'season', 'Banks', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'remember', 'WISEGUY', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'role', 'lifetime', 'making', 'actually', 'feel', 'sorry', 'ruthless', 'thug', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'are', 'couple', 'new', 'characters', 'Jesse', 'Plemons', 'Todd', 'Laura', 'Fraser', 'Lydia', 'ultimate', 'corporate', 'weasel', 'Larry', 'Hankins', 'brief', 'return', 'Old', 'Joe', 'junkyard', 'owner', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'Walt', 'company', 'out', 'jam.I', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'Chrystal', 'Blue', 'Persuasion', 'Tommy', 'James', 'Shondells', 'again', 'not', 'think', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'One', 'best', 'uses', 'oldie', 'ever.How', 'will', 'end', 'are', 'given', 'clue', 'season', 'opener', 'first', 'scene', 'not', 'look', 'good', 'especially', 'twist', 'final', 'scene', 'Gliding', 'Over', 'All', 'season', 'climax', 'up', 'showdown', 'been', 'making', 'first', 'show', 'one', 'should', 'underestimate', 'Walter', 'White', 'many', 'have', 'many', 'have', 'died']",N/A

Also grateful for the not so many longish fight scenes between Walt and Skylar (how they drag!!).  In a nutshell, this season has once again wratcheted up the tension in a way that doesn't discredit your intelligence (like in the last season) and has suddenly provided direction in which the story can go - could certainly open the way for more seasons if the producers wished and I'm sorry to hear the next season is to be the last.  Have to say I'd almost given up on this show after the last season, but it's good to see Breaking in good form once again even though they only gave us 8 episodes.  I'd rather have 8 good ones than padding or an extra 4 lame ones.  Hope they keep it coming.. they've got the direction now - they should. But apparently they're not going to. I'm surprised AMC is willing to give up this cash cow. At the end of last season I was thinking they really should hang it up.

The show has gone downhill&#34;.  Every episode perfectly showcases Walt's transformation from good father and science nerd into murderer and meth lord.  This show is more than just entertainment, it's truly thought provoking and forces you to consider your own moral code against the circumstances each of these characters finds themselves in.  It's easy to judge them because, after all, almost everything that happens is a consequence of someone's choice, but what you do?  At almost any point in the show's 5 seasons, it's easy to find an alternative, but what the show's writers have done so well is paint the characters into an emotional corner.  Sometimes, doing the right thing means losing the one you love.  Sometimes, getting rid of the one you love is the only right thing to do.  Other times, all you can think about is violence, and your rage makes you irrational.

It's also not in Aaron Paul, who's been phenomenal since the first minutes of his performance as Jesse Pinkman, the moral compass of the show (basically, if Pinkman thinks you've gone too far, you REALLY have) and its resident guide through the world we've found ourselves navigating through. It's also not through Anna Gunn as the increasingly put-upon and disassociative Skyler White, whose own personal journey over this season has caused her character to become a powder-keg of potentially epic proportions. It's not in the revelatory performance of Dean Norris as DEA ASAC and forthright brother-in-law Hank Schrader, whose larger-than-life acting style has finally been given a good home after decades in the business. It's not in the delightfully flighty Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader, Hank's wife and Skyler's sis and Walt's surprise confidant.No. This season belongs to one person, and that is Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut. Forget the young psychotics of the Tuco variety. Forget the ever-expansive reach of the Mexican Cartels and their inhuman killing machines. Forget Gus Fring and his straight-laced terror. Mike is the most frightening character on this show simply because he's the most experienced and most efficient problem-solver this show has ever had. Every subtle stone-faced glance he throws; every quiet moment of him just sitting in a room; every syllable he utters is dripping with menace. In this character, Walt has found a unique match; a master manipulator whose mind is always working overtime to figure an infinite amount of angles on not only the people he works with, but the people he must care for and especially the people he needs to ""take care"" of. He's the perfect foil for Walt in the sense that Mike, knowing what he knows already, feels that he knows or can expect what Walt will do and then Walt, not being your typical criminal, will ultimately try work out a way to out-manuever Mike. It's like a game of chess that in Walt's mind has to be a zero-sum game, but to Mike, there can be a way for everyone to win. The episode ""Buyout"" is the very best example of this dynamic as Mike finally finds a way out for everyone that can score himself, Jesse and Walt millions of dollars and walk away from the business forever. Walt doesn't want that, though, for reasons that are made all-too emotionally vital to his character. Ultimately Mike and Walt have to face off against each other, and Walt's way out of that volatile situation is also unexpected but totally in character and totally in line with where the show is heading toward.There are many comparisons to the characters of Walter White and the character of Michael Corleone; neither of them wanted to be who they became, but how they get there is something that is not so much something that is forced, but rather simply an acceptance of who the person can be when all pretense is stripped away, and yet we watch in horror as Walt sinks deeper and deeper into this subtly evil alter-ego he's created of a 'kingpin'.

1506786,A3OJPC8MOBI3X4,B0060MYKYY,Jet Lagged,"[1, 1]","First let's get the bad news out of the way. As other reviewers have already pointed out, this DVD set is only half of Season 5. Secondly, along with many others I'm sure, I preordered this set. No sooner had I received it than Amazon dropped the price. This reduction followed hot on the heels of the curious appearance of just half of Season 5 only. Question: Are we being taken for mugs?It's hard to shake off the feeling that we DVD purchasers are being taken advantage of - that there is a downside to preordering. If this is what happens then next time I shall think twice about preordering at all.The half season begins with Walt's 52nd birthday and him buying weapons for some unknown purpose. This arc never gets resolved in the half season at all. This is unfair on the viewer. It shows that the partitioning of Season 5 into two segments is unnatural. The arc needs to get resolved.Looking on the bright side, the only good thing about this being half a season is that it means we still have another second half to look forward to!And this is a truly great season, or half a season. I was completely blown away. What series gets better and better like this one does? This season's episodes are more taut and concentrated. One of the most enjoyable I have ever watched.A heck of a lot goes on in Season 5. There are some magnetic moments in more ways than one.All the cast are at the top of their game here. I would single out the memorable performance of Jonathan Banks, who plays Fring's former bagman, Mike. I think he deserves an Emmy for this one. The tension between Walt and Mike is one of the compelling features in some of these episodes.There is one scene where Mike has to dispose of an incriminating laptop. He hurls it down what looks like an old abandoned well. I remember thinking that the laptop could possibly be retrieved by the Feds. Not like Mike to be that unprofessional. It turns out that a few extra seconds were deleted from the scene. (One advantage of the DVD over Netflix is you get to see what gets left out). For the record, Mike chucks a hand grenade after the laptop. It fails to go off. Mike then says:- ""I'm gonna KILL that guy!"" In my opinion, that deleted scene should have been retained. Better in than out.The new character, Lydia, also shines.This is all great, entertaining stuff. Highly watchable.Walt starts to throw his weight around. He is now where he wants to be. He promises Jesse that there will be no more deaths. Well that's good for a laugh anyway. You feel quite sorry for Jesse's predicament. Jesse and Saul now rightly live in fear of the creature that Walt has metamorphosed into. It ain't pretty. Any residual sympathy the viewer has for Walt has now all but evaporated.The viewer also feels sorry for Hank, visibly shattered when he realises he is dealing with the criminal behaviour of a Monster. His DEA unit has never confronted anyone like Heisenberg before, though Fring came close. They have been utterly unprepared to do battle with perhaps the most disciplined mind in New Mexico. He thinks back to an innocent job he once had and wishes he had enjoyed it more - back to a time when he didn't have to chase monsters.Then comes the twist at the end!Amazon Update: 24th September 2013 - Breaking Bad has just won an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series.",5,"""SAY MY NAME!""",1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,3323,"['First', 'let', 'get', 'bad', 'news', 'way', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'DVD', 'set', 'only', 'half', 'Season', '5', 'Secondly', 'many', 'others', ""'m"", 'sure', 'preordered', 'set', 'sooner', 'had', 'received', 'Amazon', 'dropped', 'price', 'reduction', 'followed', 'hot', 'heels', 'curious', 'appearance', 'just', 'half', 'Season', '5', 'only', 'Question', 'Are', 'being', 'taken', 'mugs', 'hard', 'shake', 'off', 'feeling', 'DVD', 'purchasers', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', 'downside', 'preordering', 'what', 'then', 'next', 'time', 'shall', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'preordering', 'all.The', 'half', 'season', 'Walt', '52nd', 'birthday', 'buying', 'weapons', 'unknown', 'purpose', 'arc', 'never', 'resolved', 'half', 'season', 'unfair', 'viewer', 'partitioning', 'Season', '5', 'two', 'segments', 'unnatural', 'arc', 'get', 'resolved.Looking', 'bright', 'side', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'being', 'season', 'still', 'have', 'second', 'half', 'look', 'forward', 'truly', 'great', 'season', 'season', 'was', 'completely', 'blown', 'away', 'What', 'series', 'better', 'better', 'one', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'more', 'taut', 'concentrated', 'One', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'ever', 'watched.A', 'heck', 'lot', 'Season', '5', 'are', 'magnetic', 'moments', 'more', 'ways', 'one.All', 'cast', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'would', 'single', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'who', 'Fring', 'former', 'bagman', 'Mike', 'think', 'Emmy', 'one', 'tension', 'Walt', 'Mike', 'one', 'compelling', 'features', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Mike', 'dispose', 'incriminating', 'laptop', 'hurls', 'down', 'what', 'old', 'abandoned', 'well', 'remember', 'thinking', 'laptop', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'retrieved', 'Feds', 'Not', 'Mike', 'be', 'unprofessional', 'out', 'few', 'extra', 'seconds', 'were', 'deleted', 'scene', 'One', 'advantage', 'DVD', 'Netflix', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'left', 'out', 'record', 'Mike', 'hand', 'grenade', 'laptop', 'go', 'off', 'Mike', 'then', ""'m"", 'gon', 'KILL', 'guy', 'opinion', 'deleted', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'retained', 'Better', 'out.The', 'new', 'character', 'Lydia', 'also', 'shines.This', 'great', 'entertaining', 'stuff', 'Highly', 'watchable.Walt', 'starts', 'throw', 'weight', 'around', 'now', 'where', 'be', 'Jesse', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'deaths', 'Well', 'good', 'laugh', 'anyway', 'feel', 'quite', 'sorry', 'Jesse', 'predicament', 'Jesse', 'Saul', 'now', 'rightly', 'live', 'fear', 'creature', 'Walt', 'metamorphosed', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'residual', 'sympathy', 'viewer', 'Walt', 'now', 'evaporated.The', 'viewer', 'also', 'sorry', 'Hank', 'visibly', 'shattered', 'when', 'dealing', 'criminal', 'behaviour', 'Monster', 'DEA', 'unit', 'never', 'confronted', 'anyone', 'Heisenberg', 'Fring', 'came', 'close', 'have', 'been', 'utterly', 'unprepared', 'do', 'battle', 'perhaps', 'most', 'disciplined', 'mind', 'New', 'Mexico', 'back', 'innocent', 'job', 'once', 'had', 'wishes', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chase', 'monsters.Then', 'twist', 'end', 'Amazon', 'Update', '24th', 'September', '2013', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'just', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Drama', 'Series']",N/A

1506788,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B0060MYKYY,J. Hill,"[0, 0]","Breaking Bad begins winding down by cranking things up to new extremes.  In these eight episodes, all storylines begin sprinting for the finish line, with some unfortunately dropping out of the race early.  Walt attempts to rebuild a viable business after killing off Gus in Season 4, but soon finds that to be a task easier said than done.  In the process, he recruits a quiet, unassuming young sociopath named Todd and begins cooking in people's houses under the guise of his latest cover-up venture, Vamonos Pest.  Skylar grows increasing distant and combative, Hank draws nearer to the truth, and Mike, hounded relentlessly by the DEA, attempt to exit the business.  Jesse, continually disillusioned by the extreme violence around him, also makes a move to get out.  Just like the first four seasons, these episodes are intense, shocking, and unpredictable.  You can tell that the trainwreck of Walt's life is speeding toward an inevitable deadly crash, but it's impossible to look away, to turn away from the impact and miss all the carnage.  It's too bad Breaking Bad couldn't have been a show that was able to stretch out to about eight seasons, but since it's perfect as is, you could also argue that more would have dampened its palpable urgency.

1506789,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B0060MYKYY,Jiang Xueqin,"[0, 1]","&#34;Breaking Bad&#34; is truly worthy of the many accolades heaped onto it.  It is a brave and bold study of evil, and it is a rich and densely-layered universe with many complex and interesting characters who often overshadow Walter and Jesse.  And, best of all, it knows when the show must come to an end, and while the ending is a bit too tidy it is nevertheless a cathartic and delightful resolution to the entire series.I will simply point out a few problems I found with the final season:1.)  Hank's discovery that Walter is Heisenberg, and his violent fanatical response is not at all believable.  Human nature dictates that we seek self-preservation through self-denial, and Hank's entire world would have collapsed if he went after Walter, and so instinctively he would mentally tried to block out the possibility.  It would have much more believable, much dramatic, and ultimately more powerful to have Walter going out of his way to get caught, and Hank going out of his way to ignore all the obvious signs and doing whatever he could to protect Walter out of self-preservation.2.)  Walter's loyalty and devotion to Jesse is not at all believable.  Jesse is a meth-head, and known to be emotionally volatile.  Walter could have two psychological reasons for being loyal to Jesse.  One is that Jesse was like a surrogate son -- but that's kind of shaky because Walter is already too invested in his current son.  Two is that Walter wanted to get caught -- but he had shown himself too cautious and circumspect everywhere else.  Walter's relationship with Jesse is the most troubling aspect of the entire series.3.)  There's really too much over-acting in this series.  People do not become loud and angry when faced with traumatic truths or events -- they become cold and aloof, as a form of psychological protection and shield.  I know there's been a lot of accolades thrown at Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul for their over-acting, but I believe the most effective performance in the series belongs to Giancarlo Esposito, who in his understated performance also delivered the most powerful.",5,All Bad Things Must Come to an End,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,2101,"['34', 'Breaking', 'Bad', '34', 'truly', 'worthy', 'many', 'accolades', 'heaped', 'brave', 'bold', 'study', 'evil', 'rich', 'densely-layered', 'universe', 'many', 'complex', 'interesting', 'characters', 'who', 'often', 'overshadow', 'Walter', 'Jesse', 'best', 'when', 'show', 'must', 'come', 'end', 'ending', 'bit', 'too', 'tidy', 'nevertheless', 'cathartic', 'delightful', 'resolution', 'entire', 'series.I', 'will', 'simply', 'point', 'out', 'few', 'problems', 'found', 'final', 'season:1', 'Hank', 'discovery', 'Walter', 'Heisenberg', 'violent', 'fanatical', 'response', 'not', 'believable', 'Human', 'nature', 'seek', 'self-preservation', 'self-denial', 'Hank', 'entire', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'collapsed', 'went', 'Walter', 'so', 'instinctively', 'would', 'mentally', 'tried', 'block', 'out', 'possibility', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'much', 'dramatic', 'ultimately', 'more', 'powerful', 'have', 'Walter', 'going', 'way', 'get', 'caught', 'Hank', 'going', 'way', 'ignore', 'obvious', 'signs', 'doing', 'whatever', 'could', 'protect', 'Walter', 'self-preservation.2', 'Walter', 'loyalty', 'devotion', 'Jesse', 'not', 'believable', 'Jesse', 'meth-head', 'known', 'be', 'emotionally', 'volatile', 'Walter', 'could', 'have', 'two', 'psychological', 'reasons', 'being', 'loyal', 'Jesse', 'One', 'Jesse', 'was', 'surrogate', 'son', 'kind', 'shaky', 'Walter', 'already', 'too', 'invested', 'current', 'son', 'Two', 'Walter', 'wanted', 'get', 'caught', 'had', 'shown', 'too', 'cautious', 'circumspect', 'everywhere', 'else', 'Walter', 'relationship', 'Jesse', 'most', 'troubling', 'aspect', 'entire', 'series.3', 'really', 'too', 'much', 'over-acting', 'series', 'People', 'do', 'not', 'become', 'loud', 'angry', 'when', 'faced', 'traumatic', 'truths', 'events', 'become', 'cold', 'aloof', 'form', 'psychological', 'protection', 'shield', 'know', 'been', 'lot', 'accolades', 'thrown', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'over-acting', 'believe', 'most', 'effective', 'performance', 'series', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'who', 'understated', 'performance', 'also', 'delivered', 'most', 'powerful']",N/A

1506794,AL9WKVMRI6GFB,B0060MYKYY,JMM,"[0, 0]","Breaking Bad is my favorite show on TV, and I think Season 5 (Part 1) is the best set of episodes yet.The writing on this show is sharp.  The first episode, ""Live Free or Die"", gives us a flash-forward look at where Walt is one his 52nd birthday (its an intriguing scene that sets up where the series is heading).  The first few episodes deal with the aftermath of the events of Season 4, and then the show quickly moves into new territory.  With his lab destroyed, Walt must find a new place to cook.  He must also find new suppliers and new distribution for his product.  Walt's solutions to all of these problems are genius, and that's a testament to the genius of the writing staff on the show.I think that two characters in particular really add to the greatness of this season: Mike, who is given more screen time a has a more important role in the story; and Lydia, an interesting new character who is played to perfection.In addition to the writing/acting, the show has really excelled in its camera work.  The production uses the vast desert landscapes of New Mexico to their advantage and are able to shoot wider than any other TV show I've seen.  The directors and cinematographer Michael Slovis also aren't afraid to put the camera in unique places that give the viewer a very unique perspective.  The narrative this season also allows for a number of great montages, many of which feature the aforementioned point-of-view shots as well as some stunning time-lapse photography.In terms of the blu-ray, picture and audio quality is fantastic.  There is also an audio commentary for every single episode.  Another great addition is ""Inside Breaking Bad""; a short 3-5 minute feature for each episode - it's a nice way to recap the events of that given episode, while also hearing from the show's writers/actors.Please Note: This Blu-Ray set includes only the first half (8 episodes) of the Fifth Season... if you want the final episodes, then you'll need to purchase this too:Breaking Bad: The Final Season (+UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]FAVORITE EPISODES:5.03 - ""Hazard Pay""5.05 - ""Dead Freight""5.08 - ""Gliding Over All""",5,Breaking Bad Season 5 - the best episodes of the series,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,2137,"['Breaking', 'Bad', 'favorite', 'show', 'TV', 'think', 'Season', '5', 'Part', '1', 'best', 'set', 'episodes', 'yet.The', 'writing', 'show', 'sharp', 'first', 'episode', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'flash-forward', 'look', 'where', 'Walt', 'one', '52nd', 'birthday', 'intriguing', 'scene', 'up', 'where', 'series', 'heading', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'deal', 'aftermath', 'events', 'Season', '4', 'then', 'show', 'quickly', 'new', 'territory', 'lab', 'destroyed', 'Walt', 'must', 'find', 'new', 'place', 'cook', 'must', 'also', 'find', 'new', 'suppliers', 'new', 'distribution', 'product', 'Walt', 'solutions', 'problems', 'are', 'genius', 'testament', 'genius', 'writing', 'staff', 'show.I', 'think', 'two', 'characters', 'particular', 'really', 'add', 'greatness', 'season', 'Mike', 'who', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'more', 'important', 'role', 'story', 'Lydia', 'interesting', 'new', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'perfection.In', 'addition', 'writing/acting', 'show', 'really', 'excelled', 'camera', 'work', 'production', 'vast', 'desert', 'landscapes', 'New', 'Mexico', 'advantage', 'are', 'able', 'shoot', 'wider', 'other', 'TV', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'directors', 'cinematographer', 'Michael', 'Slovis', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'put', 'camera', 'unique', 'places', 'give', 'viewer', 'very', 'unique', 'perspective', 'narrative', 'season', 'also', 'number', 'great', 'montages', 'many', 'feature', 'aforementioned', 'point-of-view', 'shots', 'as', 'well', 'stunning', 'time-lapse', 'photography.In', 'terms', 'blu-ray', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'fantastic', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'single', 'episode', 'great', 'addition', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'short', '3-5', 'minute', 'feature', 'episode', 'nice', 'way', 'recap', 'events', 'given', 'episode', 'also', 'hearing', 'show', 'writers/actors.Please', 'Note', 'Blu-Ray', 'set', 'only', 'first', 'half', '8', 'episodes', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'want', 'final', 'episodes', 'then', ""'ll"", 'need', 'purchase', 'too', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Final', 'Season', '+UltraViolet', 'Digital', 'Copy', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'FAVORITE', 'EPISODES:5.03', 'Hazard', 'Pay', '5.05', 'Dead', 'Freight', '5.08', 'Gliding']",N/A

1506864,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B0060MYKYY,Luke Killion,"[1, 1]","""Breaking Bad"" has to be one of my favorite television series of all time. I didn't really get into the show until the second season, but I was instantly hooked at the beginning Season 2 with the classic Tuco and Hector Salamonca scene in the episode ""Grilled."" There is so much to say about this series; creator and producer Vince Gilligan has written one of the most original and quirky tales of organized crime in primetime's recent past.The decision to split up Season 5 made for a short tenure on Sundays at 10 p.m., but I still took a solid impression away after the eigth and final episode of part one. It's hard to say too much about this series without giving away the twists and turns to a first time viewer, yet I will warn of a spoiler alert in this paragraph. This season had the same trademark characters in the lead roles, but their circumstances have changed, as Walt and Jesse have survived a life and death game of wits within their ambivalent relationship to their boss Gus Fring (whose life Walt takes even after Gus protected him from Tuco's cartel). This season is all about picking up the pieces and ""moving forward"", as Walt says. Mike is the first one to declare that he sees the handwriting on the wall and that Walter is a ""timebomb, tick tick ticking away"" and that he has no intention of ""being around for the boom."" Season Five part one is really Mike's season, as he takes over the distribution end as Walt and Jesse resume the cook while the DEA is closing in, and the ever precarious bond between Hank and Walt is on the verge of collapse. Mike's character is explored through his fatal weakness regarding his grandaughter's ""trust fund"", and his amazing ability to cooly hold every situation together and see every curve before it arrives. In Mike, Vince Gilligan has created one of the greatest ""cop gone bad"" characters, as Mike has a shadowy past as an officer in Philidelphia. He really made this season what it was, especially his scenes with arrival of Laura Fraser as Lydia Rhodarte-Quayle, who handles the corporate end for their ""cooking ingredients"" as a Mardigal executive, the parent company of Fring's fast food chain.Although ""Breaking Bad"" is on basic cable's AMC channel, I think it can hold up to any HBO series, ""The Sopranos"" included. The metamorphosis that takes place in the lives of the main characters is extremely powerful and well defined; to portray the rise and fall is often considered a necessary cliche in mob stories, but Gilligan managed to write a storyline with so many nuances and surprises that it is hard to believe that the 5th and final season takes place a chronological year after the first pilot episode. It is an example of ""the rush"" that people get caught up in when they get involved in the drug business, both in the consumer and production ends. Though this series is based primarily from the standpoint of two methamphetamine cooks, the street level realism that comes through (especially in Season 2) says alot about the problem of hardcore drugs and the far reaching crime networks that are created to facilitate their sale and consumption.""Breaking Bad"" has dominated many categories in the Emmys since its premiere in 2008, mainly in the acting department through the work of Bryan Cranston (Walter White), Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) and Giancarlo Esposito (Gus Fring). Cranston has shown alot of range in his acting career, mixing television and cinema, appearing as a dentist on the 90's hit ""Seinfeld"" and a brief cameo in ""Saving Private Ryan"" as one of the officers that decides to bring Matt Damon's character home after the loss of his brothers. Cranston character of Walter White is a transformative role; Cranston is barely recognizable when he is in character.In ""Breaking Bad,"" each season has featured actors, as you could say that when the focus shifts to their prespective, they are living on borrowed time. Walt and his cancer diagnoses is the heart of season 1, Jesse's street hustling and tragic girlfriend is season 2, season 3 gives an amazing depiction of the vicious Juarez Cartel through a pair of twin Mexican hitmen. Season 4 brings the viewer into the real professional aspect of the drug business through the character of Gus Fring (Esposito), whose chain of ""Pollos Hermanos"" fast food joints is the front for a giant meth distribution network in the southwest US. The 5th season's part 1 (which was controversially split into two eight episode parts) featured Walt and Jesse's deal with Mike Ehrmantraut, an ex-cop and super stealthy enforcer of ""loss prevention"" for Fring's drug empire. I pesonally thought they could have made six full seasons, but it would seem that Walt and Jesse's tenure as meth kings of the Southwest is destined to be very shortlived. Yet true to Gillgan's trademark twists and turns, he chose to go out on a high note instead of dragging out the series for the sake of milking his success.What makes Walt and Jesse such relatable characters is the transformation they undergo on the screen; they begin as people that almost anyone could relate to or recognize as an acquiantance, but then change into vice lords who survive every hazard imaginable in the drug trade. Though it seems they have risen to the top through a death defying game of wits, in Gilligan's vision for the final season they are illsuited to play the role of kingpin. This says alot about Gilligan's adherance to suprising the viewer, and choosing not to follow the typical mold in many mobster movies that centers on the main characters at their apex of power, rather than clawing their way to the top.",5,Part 1 of Breaking Bad's last chapter: short but sweet,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,5616,"['Breaking', 'Bad', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'series',

I will miss it when it's over, but I have no doubt that the series will go out with a bang!However, if you've followed Breaking Bad through season 4, then you probably don't need this review...no doubt you are watching season 5 (which will be 16 episodes in all).I will say, though, that episode 1 and episode 2 were very different in tone:Episode 1? The first episode had some scenes that seemed a bit far-fetched to me (more like something from a Dukes of Hazzard episode than from a typical Breaking Bad episode).  That episode ended, though, with hints that Walt has become more menacing than ever.Episode 2?  Absolutely fantastic.  I was on the edge of my seat.  As in past seasons, the show makes teriffic use of tension caused by silence.  And, Gus's right-hand-man, Mike, is moving into a much more central role this season.  As played by Jonathan Banks, this character is just mesmerizing as he navigates and negotiates his way through the damage done in season 4.  To be honest, as much as I like Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul in their roles as Walt and Jesse, my favorite scenes in episode 2 were the ones where Mike was in charge.As someone who has shut off cable, most of my TV watching is via Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon streaming.

Yet I like this show so much that I paid almost double that when Season 5 came out. Then I found out that it has only 8 episodes! Someone is getting greedy. Not to mention, that over the 8 episodes, the show (although still excellent) seemed to lose something from the previous seasons. Not sure what. Maybe my expectations are too high.I, too, assumed I was getting *ALL* of Season 5, especially considering the price. I'm glad to hear there is more, but not happy about being gouged.Update November 17 2013:Glad to see the price for the final episodes drop a little ($34.99) until I realize that FREE Shipping kicks in at $35.00 now.

1506931,A2WYPTUQ7F16IH,B0060MYKYY,"Pinkyrose ""Pinky""","[0, 4]","Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, &#34;Sure, Mom!&#34; like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and more. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believeable.3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house--case over.4. At Tio's when Tuko throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over. Law enforcement searches at least one mile radius of a crime scene--inch by inch.5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy person on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers.7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Just not realistic.8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believeable.10. When Hank was driving by the laundry, he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night.11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him, logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town. The local car dealers rely on them to spend their cash and everyone turns a blind eye.16. Someone with the DEA would be on Walt and Jesse's side. The money is just too much of a temptation. They could have paid off their own informant.17. Jesse and Walt's DNA would be in the UHaul Truck that did the magnet thing. The magnets would get traced back to the junk yard and case closed.18. All junk yards have to give account for cars that are smashed. Even though they got rid of the RV, there would be enough left for DNA, even fingerprints. Case closed at that point.19. Someone would notice that Walt was visiting Jesse in the hospital. Case closed.20. The mask found in the desert would have had fingerprints or DNA from Walt. Case closed. It did lead them back to the school. DEA would have put in cameras and found Walt stealing more property. Most schools have cameras inside anyway. Case closed.21. Once Walt gets all that money, women would be after him.22. There are not enough female characters in this show. Women are always around where money is being made. Walt would have been tempted with plenty of 15 to 20 year olds. Hot chicks can sniff out cash.23. Walt would have been using cough drops with all that coughing.24. There is a mouth wash that cancer doctors prescribe for lung patients because of the dry mouth and odors. Walt would constantly be using mouthwash and cough drops.25. NO one with lung disease can run up and down steps. He would be on oxygen therapy with the air tanks needed at all times. Uncle Tio has them and he is sitting. Walt would not be that active with real lung cancer. Lungs determine all movement of the body. He would not be able to move like he does. Even driving a car is difficult with lung cancer and chemo.26. Nothing is said about the raids on Gus's delivery trucks. Law enforcement would have been involved, this would lead to Gus; case over.27. Ted would not be all goo goo over a 40 year old pregnant woman. He would have a long line of 20 year olds in his bed.28. Once Skylar found problems with Ted's books, he would have fired her. Men do not like bad news.29. They can pay $800,000 cash for a car wash with no questions asked????? How is that money laundering????30. Walt would have been traveling to the Caymen islands or other sites that will launder money for him. He could afford to hire a private plane.31. Walt would have an alternate plan of escape. With 80 million he would have many options.32. He would have been sending the family on long vacations, as in Europe or Australia. People with new money travel. He would keep them out of town and out of his way and out of harm.33. Most people who live in the West do speak Spanish. A person with Walt's intelligence would pick it up easily.34. Walt would buy diamonds and expensive shoes for Skylar. Woman can be bought off. Logically, he would appeal to her ego. As Ron White says, &#34;Diamonds, that will shut her up.&#34;35. The baby does not seem to grow very fast. Most children will not fit into a bassinet at age 6 to 9 months. Is that a real baby? Looks fake. Why is it always wearing a hat? In New Mexicto with heat in the 100's to 110's?36. Skylar would have followed Walt to the laundry. case closed.37. Friends of Crazy 8 would have gone to see Jesse as he was last seen with him. Why was his family never shown as interested in his disappearance. Too many people disappear with no one seeming to care. Not realistic.38. The police are portrayed as bunbling fools. Not so. They are generally very thorough. Not believeable that no police officer can put two and two together.39. There would have been a police report filed when Walt crashed the new car he bought for Walt Jr. No one gets away with that kind of damage without someone noticing. case closed40. Hank has plenty of chances to bug Walt's home or car. He would have in order to find out the truth, then, he could have built his case.41. Gus's operation was way to big for him to rely on one person to cook. He would have had cooks all over the place. He could have set up labs in his trucks. He was too smart to put all his eggs in one basket.42. Tio would not pee in a pool in front of the Don--never happen. Pee on flowers or people, but not the pool where gals are gonna be swimming.43. Walt Jr. never changes. A kid at age 16 changes in many ways. His hair style is not modern. His clothes are like circa 1995.44. Jesse's shirts never get dirty. The white stays the whitest. He sleeps in clothes, but they do not wrinkle and he does not smell. Not believeable.45. Hospitals film all visitors. Hank would have reviewed the tapes to see who was visiting Jesse. case closed46. All in all, too many things just are not believeable. Police are not that bad at their jobs and criminals are not that lucky.",5,Flaws in Breaking Bad,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,8091,"['Yes', 'am', 'fan', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'however', 'are', 'major',

He noticed it, but apparently didn't understand what it meant, i.e., that cops where there. dumb characters aren't interesting. it's not that criminals aren't busted, but it would've been much more believable had the attorney noticed the lady's noticeably altered behavior, understood it meant he was in trouble, and then attempted to get out of the bank (?, whatever the place was), and then gotten busted anyway, as he tried to leave the premises.  in the real world a criminal knows they're a criminal and would know the authorities are on the hunt for them, especially with increased anti-terrorist monitoring. just think, illegal drugs could be a source of income for terrorists, and the government would know that, and the drug people would know it too.second, the mastermind meth maker has a brother in law who's a DEA officer and said meth maker visits his brother in law at work and just happens to overhear an important  piece of information being discussed regarding the meth guy's own business (officer doesn't know his brother in law is a meth mastermind). just don't buy that officers would discuss an ongoing drug investigation in front of a civilian. though I could be wrong, just found that unbelievable.also, related to that, found the meth guy's brother in law who is a DEA officer too naive, I don't know how to put it, he seemed too uncynical to be an officer. now granted I know only one police officer, my father, now retired. my parents separated when I was months old and both went on to marry multiple times and my dad was a security officer for years before he became a police officer, and we lived across the country from one another and he almost never discussed police work with me (I don't remember but I think he may have become a policeman when I was in my 20s or 30s, and his main tip to me was to be aware of my surroundings), but the big takeaway from my dad is that officers generally see the negatives of human behavior and don't tend to romanticize human behavior. so that's what I mean by saying this officer seemed naive. incredible to me that he would not know all the major drug criminals in his territory - understandable that he wouldn't know all the small time operations, but the major ones, he and his entire organization should know that. my Dad didn't discuss this with me, but I'm assuming that criminals are called criminals because they're in trouble with the law and as such they'd be trying to get out of jail/prison, giving info on other illegal activities, in other words, snitching (which I remember from Starsky & Hutch), so it seems highly unlikely to me this meth kingpin would be unknown to local and national law enforcement, so didn't buy that part of the story. even if this guy had the most loyal workers, he still has competitors who'd likely have no problem reporting him to authorities if they were under pressure after a bust. since these elements of the story didn't ring true to me, I'm assuming that the meth part of the story isn't accurate either, though I don't enough to know whether it's accurate or not. so, because so many people liked it, and I thought the characters weren't authentic, i.e., the lawyer who is a criminal without an antenna and an experienced officer having no clue who the major meth producer is in his own town (not only that, but assuming officers would share that information amongst themselves, it meant that none of the officers knew who the top meth producer was - totally unbelievable), I didn't think the two shows I saw were all that. maybe I just picked one of the weaker disks. acting outstanding though. two and a half stars.",2,"good acting and props; story believability, not so much",1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,4817,"['just',

Watt,"[0, 0]","""Breaking Bad"" one of the best TV shows in recent memory, started out quite innocently with Walter White a chemistry teacher discovering he has lung cancer and only two years to live. Then while on a ride along with his DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank, a lightbulb goes off over his head as he watches an ex student Jesse Pinkman dart away from a second story window. He then breaks bad by enlisting Jessie in a plot to manufacture the best methamphetamine in the southwest. Ok, if Walter were here, he would insist that his is the best in the universe.Yes, Walter is an egomaniac, also a genius. Had he used his genius to cure his cancer, he would have been successful. But a show called ""Breaking Good"" wouldn't be popular.It seems that brother-in law & DEA agent Hank Schrader is, in a way, responsible for Walter hooking up with meth-head/meth cook Jesse. I think if Jesse had never hooked up with Walter, by now he would probably be dead from an overdose or killed by a drug dealer. As it is he has kicked the habit and learned a lot from Walter who has become a sort of father to him. These two could not be more different yet they are a lot alike.Now Walter wasn't irredeemably bad at the end of the pilot episode the only people he harmed were drug dealers who were killed in self defense. We almost sigh in relief when the fire trucks breeze past him to put out a fire he started. Then as it turns out only one of the dealers died. The survivor spends the season trying to talk Walt out of killing him. By the end of the first season Walter White had completely broken bad.As the next three seasons unfold Walter gets badder and badder escaping detection and seeing himself as a hero, a really BAD hero. He even gets Jesse to commit murder for him. Brother-in-law Hank is shot and almost catches Walter while he is recovering. By the finale of season four things really blow up. You gotta see it.By the beginning of season five Walter had decided he is god and can do no wrong. He even forgives his cheating wife who only cheated to get back at him. She has decided to let the cancer do what no one else can, stop him. But wait! It looks like Hank has finally got a clue. Now if he only gets up off the pot and follows it, Walter will be caught.

We also get uncensored versions of the episodes for ""Hazard Pay"", ""Buy Out"" and ""Say My Name"". There is also a newly produced scene for the episode ""Chicks and Guns"".
