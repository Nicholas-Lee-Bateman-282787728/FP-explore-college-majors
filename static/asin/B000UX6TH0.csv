1097087,AI7B4WAOV11DS,B000UX6TH0,Gregory V.,"[0, 0]","This documentary is based on Philip Melanson's books on this submect (Shadow Play and The Robert F. Kennedy Assassination).  The film is interesting and has some fascinating clips of Sirhan Sirhan under hypnosis.  But, the documentary spends an inordinate amount of the time focusing on two CIA agents who are rightly suspect for their questionable activities and their obviously right wing ideological biases.  I say 'inordinate' because at the end of the DVD (SPOILER ALERT!), the producers have to admit that their photographic evidence is suspect and inconclusive!  More time should have been spent discussing the wide variance of the facts of the case as presented by the LA police with the  results of the additional research that has been published and publicized subsequent to the LA police investigation.",4,This documentary is based on Philip Melanson's books on this ...,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,813,"['documentary', 'based', 'Philip', 'Melanson', 'books', 'submect', 'Shadow', 'Play', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Assassination', 'film', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'clips', 'Sirhan', 'Sirhan', 'hypnosis', 'documentary', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'focusing', 'two', 'CIA', 'agents', 'who', 'are', 'rightly', 'suspect', 'questionable', 'activities', 'obviously', 'right', 'wing', 'ideological', 'biases', 'say', 'end', 'DVD', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'producers', 'have', 'admit', 'photographic', 'evidence', 'suspect', 'inconclusive', 'More', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'discussing', 'wide', 'variance', 'facts', 'case', 'presented', 'LA', 'police', 'results', 'additional', 'research', 'been', 'published', 'publicized', 'subsequent', 'LA', 'police', 'investigation']",N/A

1097091,A3MX96YM4NT6HT,B000UX6TH0,John H. Macdonald,"[5, 5]","The assassination of Robert Kennedy has been essentially ignored in the high profile controversy over the death of his brother, JFK. The irony is that the death of RFK took place on a much smaller scale than that of JFK, with a set of variables that is much less complex than that of the JFK murder. The Ambassador hotel, the security guard, the pantry, the number of shots, and the assassin Sirhan all lend themselves to close study since the evidence was close at hand and the event took place in a confined space with a number of photographers and an audio recording of the shots. This should have made a tight investigation a given, with law enforcement having not only the suspect with a gun, but the physical surroundings of the pantry such as door frames, ceiling tiles, bullets, shell casings, and the physical evidence of the wounds on RFK, in particular the powder burns indicating a fatal head shot. Given these factors, one would think that the investigation would have been thorough and professional, and lead to a solid conclusion that eschewed the ambiguity of the JFK assassination. One would be wrong.The investigation by the LAPD was tightly held, and the conclusion of Special Unit Senator was that Sirhan acted alone. As usual, the evidence was locked up, held closely, and ultimately ""routinely destroyed"" so that no one can now question the results.Now, the video by Shane Alexander. The DVD is not a narrative or linear investigation of the assassination; rather it is a compilation of previously unseen video clips and audio interrogations of some of the principals in the case, especially Sirhan Sirhan. The video was taken at the Ambassador Hotel on the night of the assassination, and shows individuals who are indentified as David Morales and George Joannides, both CIA agents.  We later learn that they are also identified as watch salesmen by others who should know. The question for you is whether the ""watch salesman"" identity is real, or a cover for intelligence operatives. Those who follow the JFK assassination will instantly recognize Morales, former head of the CIA JMWAVE Station in Florida, and Joannides, subject of a protracted (and unsuccessful)lawsuit to force release of his CIA file.The highlight for many is the interview with Sirhan Sirhan, who under hypnosis says some very strange things. This alone is worth the cost of the DVD. This one will be unavailable and a collector's item in the near future.

Watching this story I am 100% sure of it. There are too many questions unanswered, too many people who had C.I.A. connections, and both Oswald and Sirhan were made a patsy by the real assassins.Robert Kennedy made very powerful enemies of J. Edgar Hoover, head of the F.B.I., Senator Josephy McCarthy and President Johnson. This can be proven as Robert Kennedy wanted a direct phone line to Hoover's office, and that the F.B.I. to go back to it's grassroots, which made Hoover irate. Senator McCarthy ordered a F.B.I check on him because Robert Kennedy refused to be at his side at a press conference after Robert Kennedy's report on arm shipments to Korea. President Johnson detested Robert Kennedy because he was more popular, and received a 15-20 minute ovation in New Jersey in 1964. Both President Johnson and Senator McCarthy were good friends of J. Edgar Hoover.Sirhan Sirhan was made a patsy of as this story shows too much evidence to suggest otherwise. As some have suggested, Sirhan was programmed to be in the right place at the right time, but another did the killing.It is a well known fact that Robert Kennedy did not want protection because of his suspicion regarding his brother's death. So why was the exit route changed? Why were there C.I.A. agents at the Ambassador Hotel at all that night? Why were there extra bullets found at the scene of the assassination?Shane O'Sullivan is one of many people who are skeptical of the offical report, so he started his own exhaustive investigation into the matter. Excellent would be a poor word to call this disturbing documentary, as new evidence comes to light on one of America's greatest and most loved politicans.This documentary is a must see and must have for anyone who has questions about Robert Kennedy's assassination, but it may also lead the viewer to ask more questions still, as I have.If this is the case all the better, as the more questions asked the more we may some day learn. Whether the American people do, or anyone else who wishes to find the truth, will depend on two things: That people never give up asking why and by whom, and that the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. are made accountable somehow.This dvd gets five stars from me as it is informative and has new evidence, but it has only half of the story and half of the facts that lead up to the shooting.

No peep about any other agency or branch.

1097099,A2P4W7YS7RKHUN,B000UX6TH0,TLR,"[1, 1]","A very strong skeptical look at the RFK assassination, though not perfect. The identification of the three CIA agents is questionable. One of the high points is the candid admission by Ruben Carbajal, friend of David Sanchez Morales, that the Kennedys deserved to be killed and that Morales was probably involved (and was likely given a CIA-induced heart attack in 1978 to silence him). Carbajal does not believe the man in the Ambassador video is Morales, and I have to agree with him. Morales in 1968 was heavier and grayer.There is no mention of Khaiber Khan, an Iranian linked to the Shah's intelligence agencies, who got involved in RFK's campaign. No mention of the close relationship between the CIA's James Angleton, the Shah's SAVAK (secret police), and the Israeli Mossad at this time. The fact that someone went to a lot of trouble to make it look like a Palestinian radical was responsible (possibly trying to link him to the al-Fatah group, which was giving Israel a lot of trouble in early 1968) should cause us to look at the international flavor of the plot.There are still many good interviews, lots of vintage footage, diagrams of the pantry showing witness locations. The recordings of Sandy Serrano's interrogation by Hank Hernandez are quite disturbing.You should also search for a copy of Ted Charach's early-70s documentary THE SECOND GUN, which features many more interviews and in many ways is better than this one. It goes into greater detail about the ballistics evidence, and discusses the disappearing photos of witness Scott Enyart.",4,A good introduction,1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,1562,"['very', 'strong', 'skeptical', 'look', 'RFK', 'assassination', 'not', 'perfect', 'identification', 'three', 'CIA', 'agents', 'questionable', 'One', 'high', 'points', 'candid', 'admission', 'Ruben', 'Carbajal', 'friend', 'David', 'Sanchez', 'Morales', 'Kennedys', 'deserved', 'be', 'killed', 'Morales', 'was', 'probably', 'involved', 'was', 'likely', 'given', 'CIA-induced', 'heart', 'attack', '1978', 'silence', 'Carbajal', 'not', 'believe', 'man', 'Ambassador', 'video', 'Morales', 'have', 'agree', 'Morales', '1968', 'was', 'heavier', 'mention', 'Khaiber', 'Khan', 'Iranian', 'linked', 'Shah', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'who', 'got', 'involved', 'RFK', 'campaign', 'mention', 'close', 'relationship', 'CIA', 'James', 'Angleton', 'Shah', 'SAVAK', 'secret', 'police', 'Israeli', 'Mossad', 'time', 'fact', 'someone', 'went', 'lot', 'trouble', 'make', 'look', 'Palestinian', 'radical', 'was', 'responsible', 'possibly', 'trying', 'link', 'al-Fatah', 'group', 'was', 'giving', 'Israel', 'lot', 'trouble', 'early', '1968', 'should', 'cause', 'look', 'international', 'flavor', 'plot.There', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'good', 'interviews', 'lots', 'vintage', 'footage', 'diagrams', 'pantry', 'showing', 'witness', 'locations', 'recordings', 'Sandy', 'Serrano', 'interrogation', 'Hank', 'Hernandez', 'are', 'quite', 'disturbing.You', 'should', 'also', 'search', 'copy', 'Ted', 'Charach', 'early-70s', 'documentary', 'THE', 'SECOND', 'GUN', 'many', 'more', 'interviews', 'many', 'ways', 'better', 'one', 'greater', 'detail', 'ballistics', 'evidence', 'disappearing', 'photos', 'witness', 'Scott', 'Enyart']",N/A

One is left with more ambiguity and another dead Kennedy. This raises more questions than it answers: were there CIA handlers at the hotel that night or was it just a group of watch salemen? or were the watch salesmen's creditials and profiles used by substitute killers? These questions are not answered in this video.This reminds me of Al Gore's DVD on ""global warming"". I'm a sucker for video...but in the end the images on the videos (RFK lying mortally wounded and hapless polar bears out for an endless swim) are more powerful, long-lasting, and in a way, deceiving than the pure factual content found on the DVD.
