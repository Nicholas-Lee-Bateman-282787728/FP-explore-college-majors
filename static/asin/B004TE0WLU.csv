1427694,A16XAW90Q8O71O,B004TE0WLU,Albatross Necklace,"[4, 8]","While the High School of the Dead is a solid 4 star series which would have made 5 star if it didn't try to use tired mechanics like the token child or puppy, the Prime streaming version is a lesson in abject failure.Where they begin to go wrong is offering this in the subtitled version only. With the current popularity of zombies in the US this would be an excellent piece to recruit new people to the anime viewing fold. Unfortunately showing this in a language they do not speak natively, stops this dead in its tracks. When anime is losing its popularity in the US, American fans need as many new anime buyers as possible to keep the flow to the US going.The Japanese track also doesn't bring through the emotion like the English track does. I have to check with a native speaker to see if the Japanese voice acting is as bad as it sounds.It gets worse. This version is CENSORED! they actually fade from content they think might be too graphic for you, the adult who pays for Prime. A few seconds chopped out here and a few gone there, is not what people want to find out they just paid for. What else is Amazon censoring without the consumer's knowledge?And the worst.. This is presented in FULL SCREEN not its wide screen presentation! It took me a second to spot why this looked so terrible when I was switching between it and my Blu Ray version until I noticed the black bars down the sides of the screen. I blame Panasonic for the time it took to spot this, due to the solid blacks on their plasma TVs and the dark room I was viewing in.All in all this streaming release is an insulting abomination. I have no idea how it could go so wrong.I recommend HOTD in its Blu Ray format. Stay away from the streaming! Please do not pay attention to people giving 5 stars to this censored, full screen version, of a very good series.I'm also very curious why Prime on my PS3 shows a single 5 star review for this?",1,Streaming is a failure on the grandest scale.,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,1915,"['High', 'School', 'Dead', 'solid', '4', 'star', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'made', '5', 'star', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'use', 'tired', 'mechanics', 'token', 'child', 'puppy', 'Prime', 'streaming', 'version', 'lesson', 'abject', 'failure.Where', 'begin', 'go', 'wrong', 'offering', 'subtitled', 'version', 'only', 'current', 'popularity', 'zombies', 'US', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'piece', 'recruit', 'new', 'people', 'anime', 'viewing', 'fold', 'Unfortunately', 'showing', 'language', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'natively', 'dead', 'tracks', 'When', 'anime', 'losing', 'popularity', 'US', 'American', 'fans', 'need', 'many', 'new', 'anime', 'buyers', 'possible', 'keep', 'flow', 'US', 'going.The', 'Japanese', 'track', 'also', ""n't"", 'bring', 'emotion', 'English', 'track', 'have', 'check', 'native', 'speaker', 'see', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'as', 'bad', 'worse', 'version', 'CENSORED', 'actually', 'fade', 'content', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'graphic', 'adult', 'who', 'Prime', 'A', 'few', 'seconds', 'chopped', 'out', 'here', 'few', 'gone', 'there', 'not', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'paid', 'What', 'else', 'Amazon', 'censoring', 'consumer', 'knowledge', 'worst..', 'presented', 'FULL', 'SCREEN', 'not', 'wide', 'screen', 'presentation', 'took', 'second', 'spot', 'why', 'looked', 'so', 'terrible', 'when', 'was', 'switching', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'noticed', 'black', 'bars', 'down', 'sides', 'screen', 'blame', 'Panasonic', 'time', 'took', 'spot', 'due', 'solid', 'blacks', 'plasma', 'TVs', 'dark', 'room', 'was', 'viewing', 'in.All', 'streaming', 'release', 'insulting', 'abomination', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'could', 'go', 'so', 'wrong.I', 'recommend', 'HOTD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'format', 'Stay', 'away', 'streaming', 'Please', 'do', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'people', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'censored', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'very', 'good', 'series.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'very', 'curious', 'why', 'Prime', 'PS3', 'single', '5', 'star', 'review']",N/A

I wish I would have seen it on its blu-ray incarnation because there was a considerable amount of censoring, done somewhat clumsily by using white out blur.  Still I have to compensate for a one star and rate it up based on the content and story.  I like harem animes and this was one of the odder offerings; after a brutally quick zombie attack decimates a high school some survivors find each other and team up to strike out into the city at large to get supplies and try to find authority figures.  I thought it portrayed the societal break down much more graphically and effectively than the big budget 'World War Z' which I watched the day after finishing this series.  My favorite of the harem of course was Saeko, the prototype quiet solemn kendo club president w/ a penchant for slicing and dicing. Her feelings for Komuro become clearer as the series progresses and she watches the other girls with a sort of world weary detachment.  I did like that it was subbed, which I prefer and as others have said, I do wish it had gone longer than 12 episodes to see further character development.
