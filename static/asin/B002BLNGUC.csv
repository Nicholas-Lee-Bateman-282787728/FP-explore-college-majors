Google ""Paranormal State fraud"" and/or ""Chip Coffey fraud"" and just research for a few minutes the many hits that will come up.2.  Read about the two former clients that have come forward with claims of fraud Episodes ""The Messenger"" and ""Hell House"" I believe.  One of their former clients is a self proclaimed psychic.  However before you dismiss her complaints as trying to get ""15 minutes more of fame"" read the whole story.  She was one of the clients in a episode called "" The Messenger"".This episode had so much evidence that was, let's just say, unfavorable to PRS's credibility that this episode, despite been listed by Amazon as being on the second DVD of Season Two, had been removed from the DVD and you will NOT find it anywhere on Season Two.  The unhappy client posted small parts of that episode on YouTube.  All the posts were quickly removed for ""legal reasons"", despite the fact that other episodes on YouTube have not been as closely guarded by the producers of PRS.3.  A lot of evidence (to say the least) has surfaced showing that Chip Coffey is briefed well in advance and in great detail by the producers about all the facts on the cases before every showing up on the set.  These are the exact same facts he will later use his ""psychic"" powers to sense.4.  If you search the IMDB website on Chip Coffey, you will find out that he is, and has been, a professional actor all of his life.5.  An entire website has been devoted to exposing PRS as frauds, using their own EVP's and video footage.  I cannot list the link here, however if you look up Paranormal State in Wikipedia you will find the site that has captured all of this shows facings/frauds in the references section on Paranormal State.Hope this helps.",1,Why I think Paranormal State is fraudulent!,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,1790,"['buy', 'suggest', 'doing', 'following:1', 'Google', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'fraud', 'and/or', 'Chip', 'Coffey', 'fraud', 'just', 'research', 'few', 'minutes', 'many', 'hits', 'will', 'come', 'up.2', 'Read', 'two', 'former', 'clients', 'have', 'come', 'forward', 'claims', 'fraud', 'Episodes', 'Messenger', 'Hell', 'House', 'believe', 'One', 'former', 'clients', 'self', 'proclaimed', 'psychic', 'However', 'dismiss', 'complaints', 'trying', 'get', '15', 'minutes', 'more', 'fame', 'read', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'clients', 'episode', 'called', 'Messenger', '.This', 'episode', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'evidence', 'was', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'unfavorable', 'PRS', 'credibility', 'episode', 'been', 'listed', 'Amazon', 'being', 'second', 'DVD', 'Season', 'Two', 'had', 'been', 'removed', 'DVD', 'will', 'NOT', 'find', 'anywhere', 'Season', 'Two', 'unhappy', 'client', 'posted', 'small', 'parts', 'episode', 'YouTube', 'posts', 'were', 'quickly', 'removed', 'legal', 'reasons', 'fact', 'other', 'episodes', 'YouTube', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'closely', 'guarded', 'producers', 'PRS.3', 'lot', 'evidence', 'say', 'least', 'surfaced', 'showing', 'Chip', 'Coffey', 'briefed', 'well', 'advance', 'great', 'detail', 'producers', 'facts', 'cases', 'showing', 'up', 'set', 'are', 'exact', 'same', 'will', 'later', 'use', 'psychic', 'powers', 'sense.4', 'search', 'IMDB', 'website', 'Chip', 'Coffey', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'been', 'professional', 'actor', 'life.5', 'entire', 'website', 'been', 'devoted', 'exposing', 'PRS', 'frauds', 'using', 'own', 'EVP', 'video', 'footage', 'can', 'not', 'list', 'link', 'here', 'however', 'look', 'up', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Wikipedia', 'will', 'find', 'site', 'captured', 'facings/frauds', 'references', 'section', 'Paranormal', 'State.Hope']",Paranormal State: Demonic Investigations

Good Wrestles evil at all levels, why not while some are in their home watching Paranormal State? Some may ask why one would ask for protection while watching a television show, but ask Chip, Lorraine, and the others who help. I am pretty sure that each one would tell you it's better to be safe than sorry.Ryan, Serg, Katrina, Heather, ELFIE, Josh, & Chad (who comes in now and again)are the true videographers, EVP users, and all their various technical tools (YES TOOLS), they should be the ones who decide what hits the copy room floor & what doesn't. I wish The team were able to do all the editing and producing. Both Chip Coffey & Lorraine Warren are tremendously gifted. Their talents should be appreciated by all. Each one of the core team brings their own gifts, and talents to the viewers' experience while watching. It is difficult to quantify the talents of every person who aides the Paranormal State Society. I do not have the experience, I simply began watching due to some incidents in my childhood.I not only have this DVD set, I have both of the complete Seasons 1 & 2 of Paranormal State. Soon, Paranormal State Season 3 will be arriving, it would be fun to have the Paranormal State Society look at what I point out &  find it was something that could not be explained!I would definitely recommend The Paranormal State: Demonic Investigations to ADULTS only. I do not believe that teenagers should be watching this, I would rate any Paranormal State DVD for only 17yrs+. The actions viewed, especially in Paranormal State: Demonic Investigations, are not actions which should be taken lightly. Yes, this is entertainment. Yes, parents will decide that is okay or not for their children to watch. As a parent, I would not show any of these shows to children under the age of 17! If your child is being plagued by some entity, contact the team. They will help you.I hope & pray the team of Paranormal State remains safe. I do dearly wish Paranormal State was an hour long this coming season. I plan to preordered Season 4 very soon!Oh, btw, if you are looking for answers about everything you may have experienced of have seen on the show, you probably will watch and come away with more questions, not less.",5,Ask for protection before watching!,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,2367,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'watching', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'offerings', 'cable', 'DVD', 'will', 'ask', 'protection', 'guardian', 'angel', 'God', 'Good', 'Wrestles', 'evil', 'levels', 'why', 'not', 'are', 'home', 'watching', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'may', 'ask', 'why', 'one', 'would', 'ask', 'protection', 'watching', 'television', 'show', 'Chip', 'Lorraine', 'others', 'who', 'help', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', 'one', 'would', 'tell', 'better', 'be', 'safe', 'sorry.Ryan', 'Serg', 'Katrina', 'Heather', 'ELFIE', 'Josh', 'Chad', 'who', 'now', 'again', 'are', 'true', 'videographers', 'EVP', 'users', 'various', 'technical', 'tools', 'YES', 'TOOLS', 'should', 'be', 'ones', 'who', 'decide', 'what', 'copy', 'room', 'floor', 'what', ""n't"", 'wish', 'team', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'editing', 'producing', 'Chip', 'Coffey', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'are', 'tremendously', 'gifted', 'talents', 'should', 'be', 'appreciated', 'one', 'core', 'team', 'own', 'gifts', 'talents', 'viewers', 'experience', 'watching', 'difficult', 'quantify', 'talents', 'person', 'who', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Society', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'experience', 'simply', 'began', 'watching', 'due', 'incidents', 'childhood.I', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'complete', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Soon', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Season', '3', 'will', 'be', 'arriving', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'have', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Society', 'look', 'what', 'point', 'out', 'find', 'was', 'something', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Demonic', 'Investigations', 'ADULTS', 'only', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'teenagers', 'should', 'be', 'watching', 'would', 'rate', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'DVD', 'only', '17yrs+', 'actions', 'viewed', 'especially', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Demonic', 'Investigations', 'are', 'not', 'actions', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'Yes', 'entertainment', 'Yes', 'parents', 'will', 'decide', 'okay', 'not', 'children', 'watch', 'parent', 'would', 'not', 'show', 'shows', 'children', 'age', '17', 'child', 'being', 'plagued', 'entity', 'contact', 'team', 'will', 'help', 'you.I', 'hope', 'pray', 'team', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'safe', 'do', 'dearly', 'wish', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'was', 'hour', 'long', 'coming', 'season', 'plan', 'preordered', 'Season', '4', 'very', 'soon', 'Oh', 'btw', 'are', 'looking', 'answers', 'everything', 'may', 'have', 'experienced', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'probably', 'will', 'watch', 'come', 'away', 'more', 'questions', 'not', 'less']",Paranormal State: Demonic Investigations

1259880,A1OHGG0JUMASAY,B002BLNGUC,Reader,"[11, 12]","Personally, I absolutely disagree with a previous reviewer who provided the show with 1 star just because of ""a demonic force is rare."" Further, it is very mean and unfair to accuse Ryan in some sort of ""religious views"" which, in that 1 star reviewer's opinion, ""get in his way of being an impartial investigator, and that is why he so frequently cries ""Demon"""" Sounds ugly, isn't? What has really happened here is that 1 star reviewer has projected their personal lack of comprehension and lack of sensitivity. It seems like that 1 star reviewer has never seen any other episodes of Paranormal State besides this particular DVD, which is solely dedicated to all 5 demonic cases, extracted from each of four seasons during 4 years of Paranormal State. First of all, it is true - a demonic force IS rare, and any priest can tell you that, there is no need to be a rocket scientist to digest this notion. However, for the past four years PRS has become very popular among the American public - and Ryan is receiving hundreds of letters on a daily basis, where people are crying for help from all over the country. The majority of these people have exhausted all their resources available to the public, and PRS is truly their last hope and last resort. It is clearly said within each episode of Paranormal State that only the most difficult cases are chosen for investigation.  Therefore, no wonder that in 4 (four) years of constant investigations of hundreds of the most difficult cases, PRS accumulated only 5 (five) episodes of demonic encounters from all over the US. This clearly indicates that a demonic force IS rare. Thus, the statement of that 1 star reviewer makes no sense in regard to Ryan. Second of all - Ryan possesses a huge heart filled with kindness, sensitivity, and empathy towards every single one of his clients. Ryan never leaves any of his clients without providing them with a specific professional help. Ryan always follows up on each of his clients for many months after the case is closed in order to make sure that they are being helped in their recovery from a trauma. Depending on a particular client's issues and emotional condition, Ryan always provides them with a variety of professional help in each episode - whether he invites a Psychic, a Medium, a Psychotherapist, a Psychiatrist, a Counselor, a Priest of any Christian denomination, an Indian Shaman, just name it! - So, what sort of Ryan's ""religious views"" is it that 1 star reviewer is talking about? Who is Ryan - a Christian, a Shaman, a Pagan, an Atheist, a Scientist, or anyone else? Maybe Ryan is all at once?! How possibly one may judge Ryan's ""religious views"" without having a clue what those views are about and if they're religious at all? Unless Ryan met that 1 star reviewer in person and secretly confessed about his personal religious beliefs, which I doubt very much so. Don't you?",5,that one star review does not reflect the reality - this show deserves ten stars,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,2890,"['Personally', 'absolutely', 'disagree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'who', 'provided', 'show', '1', 'star', 'just', 'demonic', 'force', 'rare', 'Further', 'very', 'mean', 'unfair', 'accuse', 'Ryan', 'sort', 'religious', 'views', '1', 'star', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'get', 'way', 'being', 'impartial', 'investigator', 'why', 'so', 'frequently', 'Demon', 'ugly', ""n't"", 'What', 'really', 'happened', 'here', '1', 'star', 'reviewer', 'projected', 'personal', 'lack', 'comprehension', 'lack', 'sensitivity', '1', 'star', 'reviewer', 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'episodes', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'particular', 'DVD', 'solely', 'dedicated', '5', 'demonic', 'cases', 'extracted', 'four', 'seasons', '4', 'years', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'First', 'all', 'true', 'demonic', 'force', 'IS', 'rare', 'priest', 'can', 'tell', 'need', 'be', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'digest', 'notion', 'However', 'past', 'four', 'years', 'PRS', 'become', 'very', 'popular', 'American', 'public', 'Ryan', 'receiving', 'hundreds', 'letters', 'daily', 'basis', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'crying', 'help', 'country', 'majority', 'people', 'have', 'exhausted', 'resources', 'available', 'public', 'PRS', 'truly', 'last', 'hope', 'last', 'resort', 'clearly', 'said', 'episode', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'only', 'most', 'difficult', 'cases', 'are', 'chosen', 'investigation', 'Therefore', 'wonder', '4', 'four', 'years', 'constant', 'investigations', 'hundreds', 'most', 'difficult', 'cases', 'PRS', 'accumulated', 'only', '5', 'five', 'episodes', 'demonic', 'encounters', 'US', 'clearly', 'demonic', 'force', 'IS', 'rare', 'Thus', 'statement', '1', 'star', 'reviewer', 'sense', 'regard', 'Ryan', 'Second', 'Ryan', 'huge', 'heart', 'filled', 'kindness', 'sensitivity', 'empathy', 'towards', 'single', 'one', 'clients', 'Ryan', 'never', 'clients', 'providing', 'specific', 'professional', 'help', 'Ryan', 'always', 'up', 'clients', 'many', 'months', 'case', 'closed', 'order', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'being', 'helped', 'recovery', 'trauma', 'Depending', 'particular', 'client', 'issues', 'emotional', 'condition', 'Ryan', 'always', 'variety', 'professional', 'help', 'episode', 'Psychic', 'Medium', 'Psychotherapist', 'Psychiatrist', 'Counselor', 'Priest', 'Christian', 'denomination', 'Indian', 'Shaman', 'just', 'name', 'So', 'what', 'sort', 'Ryan', 'religious', 'views', '1', 'star', 'reviewer', 'talking', 'Who', 'Ryan', 'Christian', 'Shaman', 'Pagan', 'Atheist', 'Scientist', 'anyone', 'else', 'Maybe', 'Ryan', 'once', 'How', 'possibly', 'one', 'may', 'judge', 'Ryan', 'religious', 'views', 'having', 'clue', 'what', 'views', 'are', ""'re"", 'religious', 'Unless', 'Ryan', 'met', '1', 'star', 'reviewer', 'person', 'secretly', 'confessed', 'personal', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'doubt', 'very', 'much', 'so', 'Do', ""n't""]",Paranormal State: Demonic Investigations

1259882,A3R4XIOYH1OOPV,B002BLNGUC,"Stephanie C ""Stephanie""","[1, 1]","This Demonic Investigations is pretty good. It shows in a way how so many things, people, entities, spirits, ghosts, demons, etc.. are all connected in a certain way to many of the things that happen to people everyday on a paranormal level. Although I'm very much a believer because of what I've seen and experienced many times in my own life; I'm only here to review what I saw with demonic investigation.When you're dealing with this type of subject matter, there's always a real element of creepiness, fear, and can be pretty scary to see these things that really happen to people. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. They get some things on film but alot of it is more based on the reactions of others than anything we actually see.I think if you're going to make a show about this, show us everything. Of course things have to end up on the editting room floor but I didn't buy this just to watch other ppl's faces and reactions when something is happening in front of them. I want to see what's happening in front of them that everyone is reacting to. Why are you showing me Chip's astonished and fearful face instead of what his astonished and fearful face is looking at? For example with the 'I am six' story. You don't see much of anything that actually happens.You'll see ppl having a conversation outside saying ""OMG did you see the way her face contorted? Did you hear her voice change? She didn't blink for 20 minutes. Her face completely changed"" etc etc.. I can see they're freaked out but they didn't show any of the things they're talking about. This is how most of the whole show is. It's still good but when a show like 'A haunting' does re-enactments with actors and actresses that show more than what is on film for real right in front of them, something isn't quite right about what we're seeing.. or in this case, not seeing.I'm tired of watching Ryan yell or watching ppl run with no clue what he's yelling about or why anyone's running beyond what they say they saw. If someone says there's alot of activity in one particular room, why not have a still infrared camera set up in that room? Instead we have to rely on hand held cameras that usually catches nothing for us, but we see them react over something they saw out of the corner of their eye.Again, it's a good show. You'll get a few jumps and some scares out of it. There's plenty of creepy sounds and noises that catch you off guard. But I just wish there was more being shown of what they're seeing than having the cameras focused on the crews reactions to it.
