But his inclusion made just one comedian too much.Add to that the fact that the part of Daniel Stern called for him to play his character much broader than in the previous movie, and you get an overload of humor that falls flat under it's own weight.Plots built on identical twins and the cute mix-ups that occur never really work - do they?",3,Doesn't Live Up To The High Standard Set By City Slickers I.,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,674,"['movie', 'greatly', 'much', 'weaker', 'script', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'unfortunate', 'loss', 'character', 'played', 'Bruno', 'Kirby.Kirby', 'played', 'part', 'pretty', 'straight', 'created', 'very', 'nice', 'balance', 'comedy', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Such', 'grounding', 'was', 'sorely', 'needed', 'inferior', 'sequel.Jon', 'Lovitz', 'hilarious', 'always', 'inclusion', 'made', 'just', 'one', 'comedian', 'too', 'much.Add', 'fact', 'part', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'called', 'play', 'character', 'much', 'broader', 'previous', 'movie', 'get', 'overload', 'humor', 'flat', 'own', 'weight.Plots', 'built', 'identical', 'twins', 'cute', 'mix-ups', 'occur', 'never', 'really', 'work', 'do']",N/A

For one reason or another,Bruno Kirby elected not to return for the sequel. Helen Slater was written out also. But Slater's character from the first film,Bonnie Rayburn,was mentioned in one scene. Here,Mitch Robbins(Billy Crystal) is jogging in one scene with his ""youngest son"",a cow named Norman,whose weight is now about 400 pounds. Mitch adopted Norman in the first film after Norman's mother was shot dead while borning him. Daniel Stern reprises his role of Phil Berquist,who is now divorced from his mean-spirited wife Arlene. Succeeding Kirby is Jon Lovitz,late of TV's Saturday Night Live,whose character is Mitch's brother. Mitch returns home from work one day(he celebrated his 40th birthday that day) to find his brother visiting the Robbins' home. The brother tells Mitch that Norman has a problem. Thinking the cow is female,the brother tries to milk him. ""The cow's name is Norman. You were pulling on his d---!"",Mitch tells his vagabond brother. Mitch,his brother and Ed take another western vacation. This time after abundant library research,they discover a map leading to a goldmine,owned by Mitch's and Phil's late friend Curly. Curly's identical twin appears in this film,played by Academy Award winner Jack Palance who played Curly in the first film. Mitch was about to realize that Curly was buried alive. In one scene,Phil considered reconciling with Arlene,since he misses marriage. How could he? She treated him mean. This is the same scene where he mentions Bonnie. In the final scene,Mitch and Curly's twin are in a Las Vegas hotel room with the discovered gold. This is another one of those not-too-popular sequels. I think Kirby should have appeared in this film. He was probably immersed in another project at the time of production.
