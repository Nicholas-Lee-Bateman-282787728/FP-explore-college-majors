William H Macy appears almost superfluous and seems to just be reading lines with little or no interest. A supporting cast tries hard, but just can't lift this out of the doldrums.There is real drama, and a depressing edge to the reality of boredom, inadequacy and low self esteem portrayed (I have to say bitingly believably by Slater) as you watch.The movie grabs your attention a little, and although not absorbing, it does make you want to follow the roller coaster he unwittingly steps on.But that about sums it up, you watch, and watch, and ask yourself (well at least I did) what? - The idea of someone so bored and disillusioned with life that they want to go on a killing spree isn't funny (so why the comedic references?). The taught drama this could have been never gets played out to its full potential, and the picture falls into the middle ground of not really knowing what it is trying to be. Sadly, as good as Slater is in the movie, it falls a long way short I what I expected.2 stars for Slater's 5 star performance, 0 stars for the rest of the movie.",2,Forgettable at best,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1265,"['Firstly', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'here', 'IS', 'excellent', 'doubt.Unfortunately', 'amazing', 'wine', 'terrible', 'meal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'good', 'wine', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'everything', 'was', 'overall', 'William', 'H', 'Macy', 'almost', 'superfluous', 'just', 'be', 'reading', 'lines', 'little', 'interest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'tries', 'hard', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lift', 'out', 'doldrums.There', 'real', 'drama', 'depressing', 'edge', 'reality', 'boredom', 'inadequacy', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'portrayed', 'have', 'say', 'bitingly', 'believably', 'Slater', 'watch.The', 'movie', 'grabs', 'attention', 'little', 'not', 'absorbing', 'make', 'want', 'follow', 'roller', 'coaster', 'unwittingly', 'on.But', 'sums', 'up', 'watch', 'watch', 'ask', 'well', 'least', 'did', 'what', 'idea', 'someone', 'so', 'bored', 'disillusioned', 'life', 'want', 'go', 'killing', 'spree', ""n't"", 'funny', 'so', 'why', 'comedic', 'references', 'taught', 'drama', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'never', 'played', 'out', 'full', 'potential', 'picture', 'middle', 'ground', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'trying', 'be', 'Sadly', 'as', 'good', 'Slater', 'movie', 'long', 'way', 'short', 'what', 'expected.2', 'stars', 'Slater', '5', 'star', 'performance', '0', 'stars', 'rest', 'movie']",He Was A Quiet Man
1118418,A3LMQI63GTBZ8M,B000YDBP3O,"ArtemisOfLight ""Artemis Of The Light""","[0, 0]","I started this one with a bit of skepticism. I mean, here is Christian Slater, the handsome devil from the nineties who played spooky and romantic roles with equal ease. The guy is talented, so I decided to give it a chance. Well, he's older than he used to be, and I've missed his work, so I didn't know what to expect.The movie starts in a very unsettling fashion that is both grim and strangely funny in an ironic sense. He's got my attention 100% immediately. The makeup they did on Slater was very creative and it definitely added to the character. They used his real life cosmetic transformations to accentuate the awkwardness of the role. Many unexpected things happened in this film. It's difficult to surprise me, as I'm very into story telling in literature and films and after a time they get predictable. At first, the character didn't seem likable but as the film progressed I felt more compassion for him. This is a multi-dimensional character, not flat like so many others.In general I thought it was a unique story about characters you might actually find the likes of in real life. They weren't over the top or poorly portrayed. All of the actors were chosen well, as there wasn't one I questioned as far as their placement was concerned. The ending rocked me, and there's hardly a day that goes by where I don't think about it in some way or other.In short, this movie is deep in a disturbing but not altogether unpleasant way.

1118420,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B000YDBP3O,Brad Baker,"[0, 2]","Bob is a computer geek who hates his job. He drags himself into work each day; belittled by his boss, laughed-at by the secretaries.  Not good. At lunch, he sits outide atop an ugly concrete slab and stares across at the giant monolith that is his office building. He dreams of blowing it up. At night, Bob returns to his murky home, trudging through the weeds in the yard. He sits in front of the tube, and readies a yummy TV-dinner. Life is so good that he talks to his fish(Life is so good that they talk back to him!).  But Bob has had enough. One day, sitting in his cubicle, Bob loads six rounds into his 38-special. Damn. One bullet falls on the floor.  Bob gets down to retrieve it, but wait...Someone is just about to beat him to the punch...... ""He Was a Quiet Man"" is the fast-paced, often humorous effort of director Frank Cappello.  Ancor Bay's new DVD transfer is in the original Aspect Ratio 1.78:1, and features the director's commentary, the trailer, Alternate and Deleted Scenes,and the featurette ""First Look At He Was a Quiet Man"".  The anamorphic dual-layered DVD is progressively transferred on almost 7 Gig of space. Colors are true and detail is sharp. Christian Slater is very good as Bob. ""He Was a Quiet Man""'s nightmare is enhanced by Slater's performance, which is surely on of his best. William H. Macy co-stars as Gene. Macy appeared in his first film in 1980. He received the Award for ""Fargo"" in 1996, and played a sleazy cameraman in 1997's ""Boogie Nights"".  The writer and director of ""He Was a Quiet Man"", Frank Cappello, may have something to prove, after writting Hulk Hogan's ""Suburban Commando"", and directing the quirky ""Constantine"". He's so much better here. This is not a great film, but it does contain some great moments. A fool once said that: ""Good movies reflect the truths of our lives"". I don't know about that.

1118423,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000YDBP3O,Craig Matteson,"[45, 53]","Count me as one of those that really admire (most) of this film.My disappointments:  I don't like the fire hose volume of profanity and don't believe it represents real life as much as those justifying it want to pretend it does.  And there is one rather disturbing sex scene that could have been handled differently to make the same point.  These kinds of scenes aren't ""real"" and certainly can't compete with movies made to arouse.  So, why have them?Christian Slater is terrific as the deeply disturbed Bob Maconel.  He is a cipher and used as an office whipping boy by a couple of low-level low-quality bullies passing for managers.  Like many office drones, he dreams about a woman at the office.  His dreamgirl is named Vanessa who notices the ceramic bobble hula girl he keeps on his cubicle, but she is too absorbed in her blazing rocket of a career to even pay attention to real people in anything but a passing manner.  But she has a smile that lights up a room, as the movie keeps noting.Bob takes his lunch on a spot where he has a view of the company skyscraper and has a little plastic box with a button so he can fantasize blowing the building to kingdom come.  More disturbingly, he has a real gun with real bullets that he ritualistically loads by naming who each bullet is for.  But he hasn't been able to bring himself to pull the trigger.  During one performance of his rite he drops a bullet and while he is on the floor a gun is fired and people start dropping while others scream.  An old man has carried out Bob's fantasy and they strike up a conversation that ends up with Bob emptying his gun in the old man.The rest of the movie teases out how Bob is treated as a hero, is promoted, and his connection with Vanessa who was made a quadriplegic in the shooting (the shooter thought she was someone else).  So, Bob has this secret that others approach but no one will really confront.  Even the company shrink appears only to be be circling the core issues.William H. Macy plays the CEO, Gene Shelby.  Vanessa was an up and coming VP who reported directly to him and their relationship combined the very personal with the professional.  Gene isn't really a bad guy, but just a ordinarily flawed guy running a company.  Others project their own fantasies and frustrations onto him and that is a quite realistic aspect of the film.  One funny aspect of the film is that Gene's desk is made up of multiple tables that are, together, somewhat larger than Rhode Island.The way the movie is filmed handles the madness and melting realities very well.  I had not seen these kinds of visual symbols before and thought they were quite effective.Why some call this a comedy or a black comedy is beyond me.  Yes, there are some comic moments, but the overall intent of the movie is serious.  True, Bob carries on mutual conversations with his goldfish, but what do you expect such an isolated man who has drifted into madness to do?I think this is a very effective movie and recommend it for the right audience (keeping my caveats in mind).

1118424,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000YDBP3O,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 7]","I don't know that I've ever seen an actor's performance hailed as implosive (as opposed to explosive), but I think Variety really nailed it on the head when they used that word to describe Christian Slater's performance in this film.  Elisha Cuthbert doesn't exactly embarrass herself, either, in a fairly challenging role opposite the most uncommon of film protagonists.  I can't truly say that I love He Was a Quiet Man just because it's such a dark, somber, and somewhat confusing film, but I can say that I consider this to be a fantastic movie.Slater plays Bob Maconel, a meek and generally submissive cubicle dweller with a real jerk of a boss who is constantly bullying and belittling him.  It's pretty easy to see why Bob fantasizes about blowing up the building or making his tormentors pay dearly for their abusive attitudes and actions toward him.  Unfortunately for Bob, fantasy and reality have started to bleed in to one another.  When we first meet him, he is assigning targets for each bullet he loads into a handgun, then struggling to work up the courage to put his plans into action.  On that occasion, though, the timing just isn't right, as he explains to his pet fish (with whom he has several conversations throughout the film) when he returns to his rather ramshackle home that night.  This theme of living life in a fishbowl is further brought home by a lot of up close and personal camera shots of Bob with a fishbowl-like lens and some great shots of Bob plodding along while everyone around him zooms along at a much faster pace.  The only small breath of fresh air in Bob's world of quiet desperation is co-worker Venessa Parks (Elisha Cuthbert).  She is the only person who ever speaks to him without a trace of malice.  A kind smile and a small comment here or there don't seem like much, but it means the world to Bob.Then Bob's life changes dramatically, catapulting him from would-be mass murderer to hero.  As he is loading his gun and once again trying to work up the courage to execute his own murderous plans, he drops the last bullet (the one meant for himself - gotta love the symbolism), and while he is under his desk trying to retrieve it, the guy in the next cubicle steals his thunder, so to speak.  After exchanging some ""how did it feel?"" notes with the guy, Bob acts to save the life of Venessa, becoming a hero in the process.  All of the sudden, he is given a cushy vice president job upstairs, his former tormentors become all buddy-buddy with him, and everyone is suddenly nice to him - everyone but Venessa, whose life has undergone even more drastic changes than Bob's as a result of her injury.  When she demands one favor from him, Bob feels he has no choice but to reluctantly agree.  And so begins a journey of two lost souls depending upon one another for survival.If you're expecting some kind of fairy tale ending, you can forget about that right now.  Don't expect the story to come wrapped up with a pretty little bow, either; in fact, don't even read too much into my limited plot summary.  This is definitely one of those ""what the --?  So what the heck actually happened?"" kinds of films - except this film succeeds magnificently where so many others fall flat on their faces.  Writer/director Frank A. Cappello has given us the most impressive and intelligent film I have come across in quite a while.  There is symbolism buried all through the movie, all but begging viewers to watch the whole thing time and again.  And guess what?  The alternate ending included in the deleted scenes available on the DVD is, to my way of thinking, even more powerful and moving than the original ending - and then you have the director's commentary to further satisfy your craving for additional insight.  20 or 30 years from now, He Was a Quiet Man is one of the films we'll point to when we say ""they don't make `em like this anymore.""",5,A tour de force of multi-faceted brilliance,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,3891,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'actor', 'performance', 'hailed', 'implosive', 'opposed', 'explosive', 'think', 'Variety', 'really', 'nailed', 'head', 'when', 'used', 'word', 'describe', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'performance', 'film', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'embarrass', 'either', 'fairly', 'challenging', 'role', 'opposite', 'most', 'uncommon', 'film', 'protagonists', 'ca', ""n't"", 'truly', 'say', 'love', 'Was', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'just', 'such', 'dark', 'somber', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'consider', 'be', 'fantastic', 'movie.Slater', 'plays', 'Bob', 'Maconel', 'meek', 'generally', 'submissive', 'cubicle', 'dweller', 'real', 'jerk', 'boss', 'who', 'constantly', 'bullying', 'belittling', 'pretty', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Bob', 'blowing', 'up', 'building', 'making', 'tormentors', 'pay', 'dearly', 'abusive', 'attitudes', 'actions', 'Unfortunately', 'Bob', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'have', 'started', 'bleed', 'one', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'assigning', 'targets', 'bullet', 'handgun', 'then', 'struggling', 'work', 'up', 'courage', 'put', 'plans', 'action', 'occasion', 'though', 'timing', 'just', ""n't"", 'right', 'pet', 'fish', 'whom', 'several', 'conversations', 'film', 'when', 'rather', 'ramshackle', 'home', 'night', 'theme', 'living', 'life', 'fishbowl', 'further', 'brought', 'home', 'lot', 'close', 'personal', 'camera', 'shots', 'Bob', 'fishbowl-like', 'lens', 'great', 'shots', 'Bob', 'plodding', 'along', 'everyone', 'along', 'much', 'faster', 'pace', 'only', 'small', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Bob', 'world', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'co-worker', 'Venessa', 'Parks', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'trace', 'malice', 'kind', 'smile', 'small', 'comment', 'here', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'world', 'Bob.Then', 'Bob', 'life', 'changes', 'dramatically', 'catapulting', 'would-be', 'mass', 'murderer', 'hero', 'loading', 'gun', 'once', 'again', 'trying', 'work', 'up', 'courage', 'execute', 'own', 'murderous', 'plans', 'last', 'bullet', 'one', 'meant', 'got', 'ta', 'symbolism', 'desk', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'guy', 'next', 'cubicle', 'thunder', 'so', 'speak', 'exchanging', 'how', 'did', 'feel', 'guy', 'Bob', 'save', 'life', 'Venessa', 'becoming', 'hero', 'process', 'sudden', 'given', 'cushy', 'vice', 'president', 'job', 'upstairs', 'former', 'tormentors', 'become', 'buddy-buddy', 'everyone', 'suddenly', 'nice', 'everyone', 'Venessa', 'life', 'undergone', 'even', 'more', 'drastic', 'changes', 'Bob', 'result', 'injury', 'When', 'one', 'favor', 'Bob', 'choice', 'reluctantly', 'agree', 'so', 'journey', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'depending', 'one', 'survival.If', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'kind', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ending', 'can', 'forget', 'right', 'now', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'story', 'come', 'wrapped', 'up', 'pretty', 'little', 'bow', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'read', 'too', 'much', 'limited', 'plot', 'summary', 'definitely', 'one', 'what', 'So', 'what', 'heck', 'actually', 'happened', 'kinds', 'films', 'film', 'magnificently', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'fall', 'flat', 'Writer/director', 'Frank', 'A.', 'Cappello', 'given', 'most', 'impressive', 'intelligent', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'quite', 'while', 'symbolism', 'buried', 'movie', 'begging', 'viewers', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'time', 'again', 'guess', 'what', 'alternate', 'ending', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'available', 'DVD', 'way', 'thinking', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'moving', 'original', 'ending', 'then', 'have', 'director', 'commentary', 'further', 'satisfy', 'craving', 'additional', 'insight', '20', '30', 'years', 'now', 'Was', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'one', 'films', ""'ll"", 'point', 'when', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'em', 'anymore']",He Was A Quiet Man
1118425,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B000YDBP3O,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[3, 6]","Bob (Christian Slater), a meek, lonely office worker on the brink of explosive violence, keeps a dashboard hula girl on top of his cubicle wall and a gun in his desk.  He even has a detonator in his lunch box.  His co-workers belittle or ignore him.  He eats lunch alone outside and imagines blowing up his office building.  At home, his bug-eyed goldfish tells him like it is -- and the truth is not pretty.  What's a lonely man to do?  When a tragedy takes Bob and his co-workers by surprise, Bob finds himself in a strange and demanding relationship with his long-time crush Venessa (Elisha Cuthbert.)In the tradition ofFight Club (Widescreen Edition)andMemento (Widescreen Two-Disc Limited Edition), nothing is as it seems, since everything is filtered through the point-of-view of Bob, a tortured and perhaps not-too-sane man.  We see Bob's slow, steady drive toward work as other cars whiz by in a blur of colors.  Bob vanishes and reappears as he makes his way from front door to driving seat.  In a world where everything appears fractured, Bob is the only stability, even though he is far from stable himself.Christian Slater is superb as the uptight, tortured, outwardly impassive but inwardly enraged Bob.  Elisha Cuthbert makes the transition well between ephemeral office beauty to the bitter, emotionally demanding woman she becomes, although she occasionally forces the acting just a little.  William H. Macy is properly self-absorbed, though not memorable, as their boss, Gene Shelby.The special features are notable for the cut scenes, with commentary by director Frank Capello.  Fortunately, we are made to watch the entire film again, looking for red Xs or other signs to see these scenes in context.  Instead, Capello shows the excised snippets with the beginning of the next scene only; Capello makes it clear why the scenes were included in the original shooting and why they were eventually cut.  Most interesting is the two alternate endings, both of which are not quite as compelling as the one that made it, although one comes close.In the end, this film doesn't hold together as well as some, but it is intriguing nonetheless.  The plot turns are much more startling than those in the earlierFalling Down, a film with a similar repressed male character, shot in a completely different style.",4,He Was a Tortured Man,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,2318,"['Bob', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'meek', 'lonely', 'office', 'worker', 'brink', 'explosive', 'violence', 'dashboard', 'hula', 'girl', 'top', 'cubicle', 'wall', 'gun', 'desk', 'even', 'detonator', 'lunch', 'box', 'co-workers', 'belittle', 'ignore', 'lunch', 'alone', 'outside', 'imagines', 'blowing', 'up', 'office', 'building', 'home', 'bug-eyed', 'goldfish', 'tells', 'truth', 'not', 'pretty', 'What', 'lonely', 'man', 'do', 'When', 'tragedy', 'Bob', 'co-workers', 'surprise', 'Bob', 'strange', 'demanding', 'relationship', 'long-time', 'crush', 'Venessa', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'tradition', 'ofFight', 'Club', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'andMemento', 'Widescreen', 'Two-Disc', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'nothing', 'everything', 'filtered', 'point-of-view', 'Bob', 'tortured', 'perhaps', 'not-too-sane', 'man', 'see', 'Bob', 'slow', 'steady', 'drive', 'work', 'other', 'cars', 'whiz', 'blur', 'colors', 'Bob', 'vanishes', 'reappears', 'way', 'front', 'door', 'driving', 'seat', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'fractured', 'Bob', 'only', 'stability', 'even', 'far', 'stable', 'himself.Christian', 'Slater', 'superb', 'uptight', 'tortured', 'outwardly', 'impassive', 'inwardly', 'enraged', 'Bob', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'transition', 'well', 'ephemeral', 'office', 'beauty', 'bitter', 'emotionally', 'demanding', 'woman', 'occasionally', 'acting', 'just', 'little', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'properly', 'self-absorbed', 'not', 'memorable', 'boss', 'Gene', 'Shelby.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'notable', 'cut', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capello', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'made', 'watch', 'entire', 'film', 'again', 'looking', 'red', 'Xs', 'other', 'signs', 'see', 'scenes', 'context', 'Instead', 'Capello', 'excised', 'snippets', 'beginning', 'next', 'scene', 'only', 'Capello', 'clear', 'why', 'scenes', 'were', 'included', 'original', 'shooting', 'why', 'were', 'eventually', 'cut', 'Most', 'interesting', 'two', 'alternate', 'endings', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'compelling', 'one', 'made', 'one', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'intriguing', 'nonetheless', 'plot', 'turns', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'startling', 'earlierFalling', 'Down', 'film', 'similar', 'repressed', 'male', 'character', 'shot', 'completely', 'different', 'style']",He Was A Quiet Man
1118426,A2HBRINA3F9YHV,B000YDBP3O,Doctor Trance,"[3, 6]","Without giving away the ending, this film does feel very contrived throughout, but it's all leading to a thought provoking and somewhat fulfilling conclusion.  Along the way, we get powerful performances from Christian Slater, and Elisha Cuthbert, that tend to take our mind off the absurdity of some of the plot intricacies, which include Slater interacting with digitally altered goldfish and hummingbirds; many over the top, stereotypical supporting characters; and seemingly unrealistic and out of place props within the sets.  The pacing of the film moves along at just a steady enough speed for us to go with the flow of what's being presented, and not become caught up with whether the characters' actions are plausible.  It will all make sense once the credits roll.Bob Maconel is the geeky loner played by Slater, and it's easily one of the best performances of his career.  In many films, this type of character would receive some sort of pity from the audience, and a degree of likability, but not in Slater's case.  I believe it was the film's intention to not have this person gain any acceptance, and Slater pulls this aspect of the character off to a tee.  He remains the secluded, picked on office worker with suicidal and homicidal tendencies, without ever becoming anything more.Supporting roles are minimal, with the most noteworthy being William H. Macy in prime form as Slater and Cuthbert's boss.  The cinematography is crisp and many daylight and well lit scenes pull away from the dark tones of the film, and lead viewers away from any dreary feeling a story like this could convey.Overall, it's a very entertaining and unique twist on such oft covered plots such as the picked on office worker snapping, the nerd obsessing over the prom queen, and the question of pulling the plug on a quadriplegic.  It's depressing topics covered in a rather entertaining way, with a very suprising turn from a veteran actor who has never quite been taken seriously throughout his career.There's two alternate endings in the special features section, with both of them running along nearly the same path of events as the original ending, but taking very abrupt and different turns right before the fade to credits.  It's amazing that any of the other two could have been dropped in without taking much impact away from the entire movie.  It really shows the strength of this 4 star film.",4,"A remarkable, unlikeable, against-type role for Slater.",1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,2397,"['giving', 'away', 'ending', 'film', 'feel', 'very', 'contrived', 'leading', 'thought', 'provoking', 'somewhat', 'fulfilling', 'conclusion', 'way', 'get', 'powerful', 'performances', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'tend', 'take', 'mind', 'absurdity', 'plot', 'intricacies', 'include', 'Slater', 'interacting', 'digitally', 'altered', 'goldfish', 'hummingbirds', 'many', 'top', 'stereotypical', 'supporting', 'characters', 'seemingly', 'unrealistic', 'place', 'props', 'sets', 'pacing', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'just', 'steady', 'enough', 'speed', 'go', 'flow', 'what', 'being', 'presented', 'not', 'become', 'caught', 'up', 'characters', 'actions', 'are', 'plausible', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'credits', 'roll.Bob', 'Maconel', 'geeky', 'loner', 'played', 'Slater', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'many', 'films', 'type', 'character', 'would', 'receive', 'sort', 'pity', 'audience', 'degree', 'likability', 'not', 'Slater', 'case', 'believe', 'was', 'film', 'intention', 'not', 'have', 'person', 'gain', 'acceptance', 'Slater', 'aspect', 'character', 'tee', 'secluded', 'picked', 'office', 'worker', 'suicidal', 'homicidal', 'tendencies', 'ever', 'becoming', 'anything', 'more.Supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'minimal', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'being', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'prime', 'form', 'Slater', 'Cuthbert', 'boss', 'cinematography', 'crisp', 'many', 'daylight', 'well', 'lit', 'scenes', 'pull', 'away', 'dark', 'tones', 'film', 'lead', 'viewers', 'away', 'dreary', 'feeling', 'story', 'could', 'convey.Overall', 'very', 'entertaining', 'unique', 'twist', 'such', 'oft', 'covered', 'plots', 'such', 'picked', 'office', 'worker', 'snapping', 'nerd', 'obsessing', 'prom', 'queen', 'question', 'pulling', 'plug', 'quadriplegic', 'depressing', 'topics', 'covered', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'way', 'very', 'suprising', 'turn', 'veteran', 'actor', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'been', 'taken', 'seriously', 'career.There', 'two', 'alternate', 'endings', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'running', 'along', 'nearly', 'same', 'path', 'events', 'original', 'ending', 'taking', 'very', 'abrupt', 'different', 'turns', 'right', 'fade', 'credits', 'amazing', 'other', 'two', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'taking', 'much', 'impact', 'away', 'entire', 'movie', 'really', 'strength', '4', 'star', 'film']",He Was A Quiet Man

1118428,A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,B000YDBP3O,"Erik Olson ""Seeker Reviews""","[2, 4]","In the Twilight Zone episode, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" a man miraculously escapes death but discovers that his mind has played a cruel trick on him.  Much the same appears to occur in ""He Was a Quiet Man,"" starring Christian Slater, Elisha Cuthbert, and William H. Macy.  Unfortunately, this modern take on a classic story won't stand the test of time.Picture Bob Maconel as a thinner, angrier, and slightly more articulate version of Milton from the movie ""Office Space.""  Behind the pulled shades of his dank home Bob shows Son-of-Sam potential during animated discussions with a foul-mouthed goldfish, and the highlight of his lunch break is mentally blowing up his massive office building with a twisted version of the ""Easy"" button.  Living in a fantasy world and fuming over life's injustices, he plans to exact revenge on his workplace tormentors.But right before go-time, something happens that transforms him from wacko to hero.  He gets his 15 minutes of media fame, gains a promotion, and former antagonists become friends and colleagues.  Even the beautiful but aloof coworker he loved from afar begins to return his affection.  It looks like Bob finally gets everything good he ever wanted.  So, why can't he relax and enjoy his new and improved life?  It seems that Bob is the kind of guy who isn't happy unless he's miserable.  Sadly, but predictably, his new house of cards begins to crumble, and events hurtle toward another violent climax.  Or do they?When the credits roll, we are left to ask: What the heck just happened?  Was it all a pipe dream, concocted by a feverish soul grasping for redemption in the last possible instant before disaster?  Or was Bob on an irredeemable fast track to meltdown despite having the good life handed to him on a silver platter?  Either way, it left a bad taste in my mouth.  We see the cracks forming in Bob's shiny new world, and dismay builds when they enlarge.  Watching Bob take the road less traveled is like watching a train wreck in increments.  Indeed, perhaps it was the filmmaker's intent to show that some people are simply FUBAR, no matter what.Still, I hoped for a more redemptive angle vs. what actually played out in ""He Was a Quiet Man.""  That's not to say I don't like downer movies now and then.  I've enjoyed well-made bummer-fests like ""The Remains of the Day"" and ""One Hour Photo.""  Sometimes it's fun to go to a dark place cinematically in order to see how good we actually have it, or vicariously feel the emotions of characters whose hopes are dashed.  But it's way too easy to take the prototypical office sad sack and make him, well, sad.  I'd rather see more positive themes played out in the too-familiar office milieu - repressed butlers and Robin Williams are far removed from my workplace (well, more or less).  Therefore I can't really recommend ""He Was a Quiet Man.""As for the nuts-and-bolts stuff, the DVD doesn't come with many extras.  There's a small ""making of"" featurette where the filmmakers exult over crafting the movie on a shoestring budget and actually getting the starring actors, who are the best part of the movie.  Mr. Slater does a good job as the tightly-wound nebbish that is Bob Maconel, Ms. Cuthbert gives a layered performance as the ambitious secretary with a luminous smile, and William H. Macy could've played the boss role in his sleep.  As for the commentary - well, I didn't want to sit through this movie again, because once was enough.  Bottom line, if you're looking for a downer movie, skip ""He Was a Quiet Man"" and check out the flicks I named in the previous paragraph - or take a detour to the darker parts of ""The Twilight Zone.""",2,An Occurrence at The Office...,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,3667,"['Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'Occurrence', 'Owl', 'Creek', 'Bridge', 'man', 'miraculously', 'death', 'discovers', 'mind', 'played', 'cruel', 'trick', 'Much', 'same', 'occur', 'Was', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'starring', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Unfortunately', 'modern', 'take', 'classic', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'test', 'time.Picture', 'Bob', 'Maconel', 'thinner', 'angrier', 'slightly', 'more', 'articulate', 'version', 'Milton', 'movie', 'Office', 'Space', 'pulled', 'shades', 'dank', 'home', 'Bob', 'Son-of-Sam', 'potential', 'animated', 'discussions', 'foul-mouthed', 'goldfish', 'highlight', 'lunch', 'break', 'mentally', 'blowing', 'up', 'massive', 'office', 'building', 'twisted', 'version', 'Easy', 'button', 'Living', 'fantasy', 'world', 'fuming', 'life', 'injustices', 'exact', 'revenge', 'workplace', 'tormentors.But', 'right', 'go-time', 'something', 'transforms', 'wacko', 'hero', '15', 'minutes', 'media', 'fame', 'gains', 'promotion', 'former', 'antagonists', 'become', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'Even', 'beautiful', 'aloof', 'coworker', 'loved', 'afar', 'return', 'affection', 'Bob', 'finally', 'everything', 'good', 'ever', 'wanted', 'So', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relax', 'enjoy', 'new', 'improved', 'life', 'Bob', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'happy', 'miserable', 'Sadly', 'predictably', 'new', 'house', 'cards', 'begins', 'crumble', 'events', 'hurtle', 'violent', 'climax', 'do', 'When', 'credits', 'roll', 'are', 'left', 'ask', 'What', 'heck', 'just', 'happened', 'pipe', 'dream', 'concocted', 'feverish', 'soul', 'grasping', 'redemption', 'last', 'possible', 'instant', 'disaster', 'was', 'Bob', 'irredeemable', 'fast', 'track', 'meltdown', 'having', 'good', 'life', 'handed', 'silver', 'platter', 'way', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'see', 'cracks', 'forming', 'Bob', 'shiny', 'new', 'world', 'dismay', 'builds', 'when', 'enlarge', 'Watching', 'Bob', 'take', 'road', 'less', 'traveled', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'increments', 'Indeed', 'perhaps', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'intent', 'show', 'people', 'are', 'simply', 'FUBAR', 'matter', 'what.Still', 'hoped', 'more', 'redemptive', 'angle', 'vs.', 'what', 'actually', 'played', 'out', 'Was', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'not', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'downer', 'movies', 'now', 'then', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'well-made', 'bummer-fests', 'Remains', 'Day', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'fun', 'go', 'dark', 'place', 'cinematically', 'order', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'actually', 'have', 'vicariously', 'feel', 'emotions', 'characters', 'hopes', 'are', 'dashed', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'take', 'prototypical', 'office', 'sad', 'sack', 'make', 'well', 'sad', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'more', 'positive', 'themes', 'played', 'out', 'too-familiar', 'office', 'milieu', 'repressed', 'butlers', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'are', 'far', 'removed', 'workplace', 'well', 'more', 'less', 'Therefore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'Was', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'nuts-and-bolts', 'stuff', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'come', 'many', 'extras', 'small', 'making', 'featurette', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'exult', 'crafting', 'movie', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'actually', 'getting', 'starring', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Slater', 'good', 'job', 'tightly-wound', 'nebbish', 'Bob', 'Maconel', 'Ms.', 'Cuthbert', 'layered', 'performance', 'ambitious', 'secretary', 'luminous', 'smile', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'could', ""'ve"", 'played', 'boss', 'role', 'sleep', 'commentary', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'sit', 'movie', 'again', 'once', 'was', 'enough', 'Bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'looking', 'downer', 'movie', 'skip', 'Was', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'check', 'out', 'flicks', 'named', 'previous', 'paragraph', 'take', 'detour', 'darker', 'parts', 'Twilight', 'Zone']",He Was A Quiet Man
1118429,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000YDBP3O,Grady Harp,"[31, 39]","HE WAS A QUIET MAN echoes the all too familiar news item of irrational killings in public places - here, in this country, by seemingly 'normal indistinguishable people'. Writer/director Frank A. Cappello has a good grasp on his subject matter and probably intended the rather slow movement of the film to underline the 'ordinary' situations that in a flash become extraordinary.  And he has a fine cast to demonstrate his thoughts.Bob Maconel (Christian Slater in fine distorting makeup) is a nerd, an ordinary geek who checks numbers form his sterile cubicle in a massive corporation, heckled  by the 'fast guys' like Scott Harper (Jamison Jones).  He loathes his life, his crumby house and unkempt lawn, and most of all the loathes the people with whom he works - except for one Vanessa (Elisha Cuthbert) who has a 'smile that lights up a room', but pays no attention to the geeky Bob. Bob is deranged, talks to his goldfish at home (and they answer back!), and plans to kill the most offensive of his fellow workers.  But in the adjacent cubicle there is a like mind who beats him to the show and one morning opens fire killing five people and wounding Vanessa with a bullet to her spine that leaves her paralyzed: Bob serendipitously uses his own gun to kill the assailant and becomes a hero for the corporation.Though Bob is unchanged in appearance or outlook he is elevated to VP of Creative Thinking under the head boss Gene Shelby (William H. Macy).  He visits Vanessa in the hospital, suffers her tantrum at being a quadriplegic, but finally is called back to her bedside and sweet-talked into being her hero life-saving guardian - and more.  Once Bob feels needed and perhaps 'loved' by Vanessa he begins to change, only to have unfortunate reminders of reality enter and alter his life yet again.Though the subject matter is rather terrifying, Cappello elects to present this tale as black humor.  In the hands of less competent actors it would like have been a dud, but with Christian Slater's finely nuanced performance the film takes on a powerful sheen.  The line between madness and normalcy is a thin one indeed and there are many disturbing lessons to be gained from watching this small but well-done film.

Bob is quite possibly the most ineffectual man you could wish to meet - he just lacks a cruel mother to make the picture complete.And yet Bob actually isn't, in the world of the film, any worse that the dreadful people who surround him. It's an excoriating portrait of corporate culture; happy hour at the bar over the road, a few rounds at the driving range at the weekend, pointless, demeaning work. The film is no gentler on the treatment of the disabled. In particularly when Vanessa returns to the office in her wheelchair, her former colleagues talk down to her as if she was a toddler. Director Frank A Cappello frames the film to exaggerate Bob's sense of alienation in the world. Bob trudges slowly out to lunch as speeded up cars roar past him. He is often shot in extreme close-up, sweating, with a particularly attractive pimple glowing on his forehead.In the end, though, the film fails to say anything terribly original about alienation and the modern world, other than that it's enough to drive some people crazy. And I think we knew that.

Bob is a nebbish of an office drone, who has two way conversations with his fish, is generally put upon by all around him, and leads what can charitably be described as a pathetic and pitiable existence. His life is a mess, and he has fantasies about shooting his co-workers and himself.As you might expect, being such a nebbish, Bob lacks the guts to actually accomplish his plan.  On yet another day when Bob is pushed around, another co-worker's rampage provides Bob the unexpected opportunity to be a hero...So begins ""He was a Quiet Man"", a movie which is a compound of motifs and other movies in an uneasy jumble.  Despite an unlikeable protagonist, Slater's performance is very unlike most of his previous characters. We do get a sense of just how put upon Bob is in his life.  Elisha Cuthbert, William F Macy and the minor actors in the movie do decent jobs.Still, the movie isn't cohesive.  Talking fish, a nebbish protagonist, and strands of several plots just don't add up to a whole. It feels like pieces of several movies put together.The ending of the movie is an twist which causes you to re-frame most of the events seen.  It doesn't feel like a cheat, however, and given what we had seen of Bob, it fits in with his personality.

Though one wonders why he did not choose to release it in the confines of a film that focused on form over function.""The ending of the film feels tacked on...and with good reason.  It was, to paraphrase the director, ""not how the film originally ended but how the film should of ended being nearer in spirit to the original draft of the screen play.""What?There is nothing wrong with a little rewrite. To say that the ending was telegraphed does a disservice to the years of fine work the telegraph has done as means of mass communication.  All the good will the movie has built up with clever uses of FX, the fine work of the aforementioned Mr.Slater, and a cast of slightly underused supporting players (and let us not forget a talking fish - who doesn't like talking fish?), all this is washed away in the last 10 minutes of the film.  The last line of dialogue uttered by Mr. Slater is, ""There comes a time when the diseased and the weak must be sacrificed in order to save the herd."" Well that's just dandy, thank you very much I'll take my molotov cocktail and cyanide capsule now, please.Now, I love a little existential angst as  much as the next woman but a movie that dares to brandish the quote, ""Like the bastard child of Brazil, Fight Club and Amelie..."" on its DVD box-cover better bring the goods in one of the areas of at least ONE of those films. Quirky romance, dystopian visions of a society where man is reduced to drone, cinematography that either screams ""LOOK AT ME, MY COLORS FLY OFF THE SCREEN"" or ""DON'T LOOK AT ME MY COLOR PALETTE IS DRAB AND MUTED, SO COOL, SO UNDERSTATED"" or at the very least have a script with enough verve and panache that I'm willing to overlook the huge leaps of logic it takes for Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton to all be dancing on the same psychological ID card. Unfortunately somewhere along the way, ""Quiet Man"" becomes as unhinged as it's protagonist and never really measures up in any of these categories.For film geeks, the 10 minute featurette on the making of the film does give a good, if short glimpse of the interior works of a low budget film.

Both alternate endings made it clear that the whole movie was a fantasy, and that's more what the movie felt like - like it was SUPPOSED to be a dream.With the ending it had, however, it just seems like a poorly-directed, internally-conflicted film with poor writing and some good actors in it.",3,Might be OK if you're in the mood,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,791,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'reviewing', 'basic', 'plot', 'need', 'go', 'here', 'reason', 'gave', 'so', 'few', 'stars', 'whole', 'thing', 'felt', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'felt', 'very', 'plastic', 'very', 'contrived', 'course', 'whole', 'plot', 'made', 'sense', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '****There', 'are', 'three', 'endings', 'suggest', 'watch', 'two', 'alternate', 'endings', 'Extra', 'Features', 'section', 'Personally', 'preferred', 'second', 'alternate', 'felt', 'much', 'more', 'cohesive', 'integral', 'film', 'alternate', 'endings', 'made', 'clear', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'fantasy', 'more', 'what', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'dream.With', 'ending', 'had', 'however', 'just', 'poorly-directed', 'internally-conflicted', 'film', 'poor', 'writing', 'good', 'actors']",He Was A Quiet Man

How much of ourselves do we show in public? Is that hunky guy REALLY a mouse at heart? Is that gorgeous blonde REALLY a nagging shrew?Christian Slater has finally delivered his best! He plays Bob Maconel, a bookish nerd office worker who talks to his pet fish, moving headlong into middle age with nothing to show for all his toil. Elisha Cuthbert plays a woman who works in an office upstairs, with the CEO (William H. Macy), after sleeping her way to the position she holds. While it may seem that these two have absolutely NOTHING in common, an incident in Bob's office basically brings these two together in the most unexpected way.The relationship that developes gives Bob a new lease on life. he no longer dreams of revenge (did I say he keeps a loaded revolver in his desk?), but rather, how he can make life worth living, for both himself, and the new woman in his life. Because of the circumstances surrounding his part in the office incident, Bob is a hero! He is given an office upstairs! The job is really nothing more than a senecure, but it affords Bob a greater sense of security. Life is good! Until..........Many have compared this film to ""Brazil"", and while it has more than just a passing similarity to it, the performances of the principle actors in this most darkest of comedies, is awards-worthy!

1118444,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000YDBP3O,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 4]","Writer/director Frank Cappello, in the commentary he provides for the movie, talks about how he absolutely loathes movies that have theexactsamecop-outendingas HE WAS A QUIET MAN.  Then he goes on to (inadequately) explain what sets his particular version apart.  His rationalizations, and the remarkably artful clues that brim throughout the movie, do little to soften the blow.  Most viewers are bound to feel cheated.The good news is that, although the conclusion is of the cheap-variety, the movie that precedes it is captivating (and intelligent) enough to (mostly) make up for it.  The film follows office drone Bob Maconel as he desperately tries to hold on to all of his marbles.  Played marvelously by a hardly-recognizable Christian Slater, Bob is about to go on your run-of-the-mill killing spree when an amazing thing happens: someone else goes on a killing spree first.  Bob, gun in hand, stops the murderer, and instead of being the psychopath in his life's grim tale, Bob is thrust into the unlikely position of Hero.Bob is suddenly fast-tracked into the upper echelons of corporate life.  The office sexpot starts making moves on him.  And the alpha males that once mocked him are now schmoozing up to him every chance they get.  Bob's life, once a mural of insignificance, has become a charade of chivalry.  Bob tries to live up to his new heroic image, but something's awry.  The world he once loathed -- the masks and mockery -- is now a part of him.  It doesn't sit well.The one thing that does sit well is Vanessa Parks, a beautiful young co-worker that was paralyzed from the neck down during the shootings.  Bob takes her under his wing, and it is her helpless need and love that really injects meaning into his once futile existence.  But Bob's new life, just like his old one, doesn't stay put together for long.Exactly what's wrong is hinted at with some sumptuous and masterful directing.  Dreams, background news shows, calendars, scribbled notes, broken hula figurines, and gray Rubik's cubes: keep your eyes open, and you'll be able to trace the fissures in Bob's life to their inevitable conclusion.  It may be a well-trod path that the film treads, but it treads it well.Ultimately, the best part of the movie is how it takes an old question and turns it around.  People often wonder why anyone -- teens in trenchcoats, demoralized office oafs -- go nuts and start killing people, but this movie seems to wonder why the rest of us don't follow suit.  What keeps us sane, anyway?  Why aren't we all as unhinged as poor, poor Bob?The disc contains several alternate endings, most of which work in equal measure, although the ""LIFE SAVER"" ending I found to be the most poignant.  In any case, the movie's answers aren't nearly as captivating as its well-phrased questions, questions that are delivered with a darkly comic spin.  The finale may arouse some disappointment, but it will also arouse discussion.  He may be a quiet man, but he still has a lot to say.",4,Who's The Boss?,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,2991,"['Writer/director', 'Frank', 'Cappello', 'commentary', 'movie', 'talks', 'how', 'absolutely', 'movies', 'have', 'theexactsamecop-outendingas', 'HE', 'A', 'QUIET', 'MAN', 'Then', 'inadequately', 'explain', 'what', 'particular', 'version', 'apart', 'rationalizations', 'remarkably', 'artful', 'clues', 'brim', 'movie', 'do', 'little', 'soften', 'blow', 'Most', 'viewers', 'are', 'bound', 'feel', 'cheated.The', 'good', 'news', 'conclusion', 'cheap-variety', 'movie', 'captivating', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'mostly', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'office', 'drone', 'Bob', 'Maconel', 'desperately', 'hold', 'marbles', 'Played', 'marvelously', 'hardly-recognizable', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Bob', 'go', 'run-of-the-mill', 'killing', 'spree', 'when', 'amazing', 'thing', 'happens', 'someone', 'else', 'killing', 'spree', 'first', 'Bob', 'gun', 'hand', 'murderer', 'instead', 'being', 'psychopath', 'life', 'grim', 'tale', 'Bob', 'thrust', 'unlikely', 'position', 'Hero.Bob', 'suddenly', 'fast-tracked', 'upper', 'echelons', 'corporate', 'life', 'office', 'sexpot', 'making', 'moves', 'alpha', 'once', 'mocked', 'are', 'now', 'schmoozing', 'up', 'chance', 'get', 'Bob', 'life', 'once', 'mural', 'insignificance', 'become', 'charade', 'chivalry', 'Bob', 'live', 'up', 'new', 'heroic', 'image', 'something', 'awry', 'world', 'once', 'loathed', 'masks', 'mockery', 'now', 'part', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well.The', 'one', 'thing', 'sit', 'well', 'Vanessa', 'Parks', 'beautiful', 'young', 'co-worker', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'neck', 'down', 'shootings', 'Bob', 'wing', 'helpless', 'need', 'love', 'really', 'meaning', 'once', 'futile', 'existence', 'Bob', 'new', 'life', 'just', 'old', 'one', ""n't"", 'stay', 'put', 'together', 'long.Exactly', 'what', 'wrong', 'hinted', 'sumptuous', 'masterful', 'directing', 'Dreams', 'background', 'news', 'shows', 'calendars', 'scribbled', 'notes', 'broken', 'hula', 'figurines', 'gray', 'Rubik', 'cubes', 'keep', 'eyes', 'open', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'trace', 'fissures', 'Bob', 'life', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'may', 'be', 'well-trod', 'path', 'film', 'treads', 'well.Ultimately', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'how', 'old', 'question', 'around', 'People', 'often', 'wonder', 'why', 'anyone', 'teens', 'trenchcoats', 'demoralized', 'office', 'oafs', 'go', 'nuts', 'start', 'killing', 'people', 'movie', 'wonder', 'why', 'rest', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'suit', 'What', 'sane', 'anyway', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'unhinged', 'poor', 'poor', 'Bob', 'disc', 'several', 'alternate', 'endings', 'most', 'work', 'equal', 'measure', 'LIFE', 'SAVER', 'ending', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'poignant', 'case', 'movie', 'answers', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'captivating', 'well-phrased', 'questions', 'questions', 'are', 'delivered', 'darkly', 'comic', 'spin', 'finale', 'may', 'arouse', 'disappointment', 'will', 'also', 'arouse', 'discussion', 'may', 'be', 'quiet', 'man', 'still', 'lot', 'say']",He Was A Quiet Man

The one person not showering Bob with praise is the object of his desire, Venessa, who is left a quadriplegic by the mayhem. But even Venessa quickly comes around when she discovers a glimmer of hope for the future. She and Bob become an unusual item, and Bob is suddenly in suburban paradise, but for how long? If Bob was disturbed enough to be planning a murderous rampage in the beginning, could Venessa's attention really be an instant cure? Or is it even real?A dreamlike masterpiece from writer/director Frank A. Cappello, ""He Was a Quiet Man"" takes viewers on a mental dark ride through the thoughts of a madman teetering on the brink. Bizarre visuals that mix fantasy with reality will keep you unsure of everything you're seeing. The knowledge that Bob is a ticking timebomb will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the end result will leave you contemplating the film and its ideas for some time after. Make-up and an amazing performance make Christian Slater as Bob absolutely unrecognizable and highly award worthy. Elisha Cuthbert is no less remarkable in her role as the beautiful but perplexing Venessa, and William H. Macy is as flawless as ever as their sleazy boss.The film's twist ending is sure to leave most viewers a bit bewildered, but if you can't stand having to figure things out for yourself, you need only explore the DVD's bonus features for understanding. There are deleted and alternate scenes, a trailer, a behind the scenes look, and director commentaries. The main extras, of course, are those director's commentaries over the film and the deleted scenes/alternate endings. These will answer most of your questions about vague things that were seen in the film, though they also may leave some viewers confused or disagreeing with the director's overall feelings on the subject matter. His stance seems to be that the problems of society are not the bullies and such, but the disturbed people they create. I would have to say that both are a problem. The suggested cure, ""thinning the herd"" by weeding out the dangerously disturbed victims of bullying and neglect, is important, but it doesn't strike at the source of the problem. What is needed is a non-violent answer to dealing with not only the potentially dangerous nuts, but the more socially-accepted nuts that create them as well. But, hey, that's just some of the debate this film inspires.

He is a disgruntled employee and simply cannot muster the strength, thankfully, to actually pull the trigger.

Slater's character then shoots that man and puts an end to his rampage.  And he is almost declared the hero, though no one ever knows if he shot that man in defense or out of spite because that man did what he never could.No matter how many times anyone describes this movie to me as a comedy, I will simply not understand where that comes from.  You may call it a dark comedy, but it is dark without the comedy.  The characters are all so uncomfortable around each other, you cannot help but feel uncomfortable seeing them on screen.  The plot is weak, which would lead me to assume the characters were the focus, but consider that not only does Slater's guy take his gun to work everyday but he only talks to his fish.  Oh yeah, and they talk to him too.  You decide.The movie glossed over the fact that he carried a gun to work every day, almost as if society has become so accustomed to violence that this is acceptable behavior.

It's true this film has a core setting much like OFFICE SPACE but the absolutely tremendous acting performance by Christian Slater creates some very real touching moments in the midst of the surreal bizarre story lines.

1118458,A1JEFESGLIS076,B000YDBP3O,rsoonsa,"[0, 3]","Absorbing Drama Leads To Vivid Climax.Paranoiac Bob Maconel (Christian Slater), after years of plodding at tiresome white collar toil in a relentlessly tedious and encubed office job for a large corporation, has amassed an enormous amount of distaste for a good many of his fellow wage slaves, as a result planning to dispatch them, using a revolver that he has hidden within his desk.  To his mind, Bob has adroitly fabricated an impending moment of homicidal truth, as justified through his voiceover narration that is heard during the film's outset; however, a stunning occurrence in his office completely obviates his plan, turning him into an heroic celebrity rather than a mass murderer.  Additionally, an outwardly stolid Maconel has become romantically involved with a young woman, also employed by the corporation, of whom he has fantasized, their involvement brought about by the startling and unplanned turn of office events.  Or have they become involved?  A linear quality that marks earlier portions of the narrative recedes as wandering storyline elements invest a scenario that may, in truth, be a reflection of Bob's troubled consciousness.  If a viewer will feel outwitted by all of this, the cause must be ascribed to the director of the work, Frank Cappello, who also scripts, produces, and composes some of the songs for a thoroughly engaging film that has moved from production directly to its DVD release, although expanded distribution for theatre showing is ostensibly in the offing.  This low budget film that depicts a man who may have become an accidental hero, profits from able performances turned in by a partially inexperienced cast, with Slater and veteran William F. Macy being standouts.  The acting laurels are garnered by Elisha Cuthbert for her playing in a difficult role as an evident quadriplegic.  Camerawork, editing, as well as other production characteristics are top-flight, especially when minimal available funding is a consideration.  An Anchor Bay DVD package has deservedly been found to be popular, as it offers very good audio and visual quality.  The disc includes special features: deleted and alternate scenes/a ""First Look At....""/a trailer/, along with a notably valuable commentary option featuring director Cappello.  This latter will be most valuable indeed for cin&eacute;astes as Cappello, who speaks from the top of his head, comprehensively discusses how he hit upon those ideas that contributed to the film's construction, and how individual episodes were moulded, in addition to his observations of the sundry personalities who were associated with the affair.  Some questions that may have occurred to viewers will be handily answered here by the writer/director through his remarks that are in themselves worth the price of the DVD package.",4,Absorbing Drama Leads To Vivid Climax.,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,2809,"['Absorbing', 'Drama', 'Leads', 'Vivid', 'Climax.Paranoiac', 'Bob', 'Maconel', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'years', 'plodding', 'tiresome', 'white', 'collar', 'toil', 'relentlessly', 'tedious', 'encubed', 'office', 'job', 'large', 'corporation', 'amassed', 'enormous', 'amount', 'distaste', 'good', 'many', 'fellow', 'wage', 'slaves', 'result', 'planning', 'dispatch', 'using', 'revolver', 'hidden', 'desk', 'mind', 'Bob', 'adroitly', 'fabricated', 'impending', 'moment', 'homicidal', 'truth', 'justified', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'heard', 'film', 'outset', 'however', 'stunning', 'occurrence', 'office', 'completely', 'plan', 'turning', 'heroic', 'celebrity', 'rather', 'mass', 'murderer', 'Additionally', 'outwardly', 'stolid', 'Maconel', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'young', 'woman', 'also', 'employed', 'corporation', 'whom', 'fantasized', 'involvement', 'brought', 'about', 'startling', 'unplanned', 'turn', 'office', 'events', 'have', 'become', 'involved', 'linear', 'quality', 'earlier', 'portions', 'narrative', 'recedes', 'wandering', 'storyline', 'elements', 'invest', 'scenario', 'may', 'truth', 'be', 'reflection', 'Bob', 'troubled', 'consciousness', 'viewer', 'will', 'feel', 'outwitted', 'cause', 'must', 'be', 'ascribed', 'director', 'work', 'Frank', 'Cappello', 'who', 'also', 'scripts', 'produces', 'songs', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'film', 'moved', 'production', 'directly', 'DVD', 'release', 'expanded', 'distribution', 'theatre', 'showing', 'ostensibly', 'offing', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'accidental', 'hero', 'profits', 'able', 'performances', 'turned', 'partially', 'inexperienced', 'cast', 'Slater', 'veteran', 'William', 'F.', 'Macy', 'being', 'standouts', 'acting', 'laurels', 'are', 'garnered', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'playing', 'difficult', 'role', 'evident', 'quadriplegic', 'Camerawork', 'editing', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'production', 'characteristics', 'are', 'top-flight', 'especially', 'when', 'minimal', 'available', 'funding', 'consideration', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'package', 'deservedly', 'been', 'found', 'be', 'popular', 'very', 'good', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes/a', 'First', 'Look', '/a', 'trailer/', 'notably', 'valuable', 'commentary', 'option', 'featuring', 'director', 'Cappello', 'latter', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'valuable', 'indeed', 'cin', 'eacute', 'Cappello', 'who', 'top', 'head', 'comprehensively', 'how', 'hit', 'ideas', 'contributed', 'film', 'construction', 'how', 'individual', 'episodes', 'were', 'moulded', 'addition', 'observations', 'sundry', 'personalities', 'who', 'were', 'associated', 'affair', 'questions', 'may', 'have', 'occurred', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'handily', 'answered', 'here', 'writer/director', 'remarks', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD', 'package']",He Was A Quiet Man
1118459,A9LNWA25IM2DX,B000YDBP3O,"R.Suarez ""R-Suarez-""","[0, 3]","Starring Christian Slater as Bob Maconel, `He was a quiet man' tells the story of an office employee who owns a gun and secretly desires to kill his coworkers. The movie is an interesting drama about Maconel's life suddenly giving a twist for good that could end up making him a different person, as the story unfolds Elisha Cuthbert's character and Slater's crash into an ending that pretends to be dramatic, but that builds up so much that when you see it you expect what happens.Prior credits of writer/director/producer Frank Capello include the writing of the screenplay for `Constantine'. Being this his debut film it is understandable that he loaded it with all the techniques he liked and wanted to use. The technical aspect of the film does not present any innovative ideas, some of the effects used are the Snorricam (an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, a trademark of director Darren Aronofsky in `Pi' and `Requiem for a dream') as well as the CGI shots going into small places (there is a shot in which the camera goes inside an ear of Slater's character that you can't help to compare to the initial gun shot of David Fincher's `Fight Club') Another thing to note is that this low budget movie uses lots of CGI effects, most of them looking so unrealistic that end up distracting the viewer from what's happening to the characters.The music is in charge of Jeff Beal (who composed the music for `Rome' and `Carnivale'); after his work in the HBO series `Rome' I expected something original, the music is clearly influenced by the Dust Brothers' job for `Fight Club'.After watching the film I was wondering why people were comparing this to other films such as `Fight Club' or `Amelie', as this film has nothing to do being compared to the mentioned movies. In the `first look documentary' included there is a moment in which director Frank Capello (in a moment of arrogance) claims his movie is an ""Amelie meets Fight Club"" story. I still don't see what the reference might be but please don't fall for it as this movie is nothing close to any of the two mentioned.Extras are a few, some deleted scenes that do not add anything to the story (which explains why they were removed) and a 10 minute length featurette called `First look at He was a quiet man'. Audio is mastered both in 5.1 and 2.0 with no subtitles (not even in English, though it is close captioned).An entertaining film with average performances by the actors (I believe William H.

Much of the work is crossed with FX work done by the Director.This comes out especially in the fact that there are 3 endings  made for the film.One of the endings was done entirely by the director. The ability to do this was basically  because  of the digital cameras. This also gave rise to the production problem that no-one saw Dailies, since none were available, the film was done and seen  in post production.The director says, in the DVD  extras, that this film  is about ""looking for a way out"" of his difficult situation in cubicle hell.In the process of doing this ( whether in dream or in real life, especially if you see ending Number 3 which supports the Dream view of the film) part of the extras show that his ( Christian Slaters Character) has the love for the girl (Elisha Cuthbert) to keep him breaking down.In the extras, the director states that his message is that those people in these situations, should, if they don't want to be here in this world, then they should take themselves out and not take anyone else out.This view is highly debateable, and to say the least controversial, and it is what the director wants.Slater delivers the goods in this film, as does William Macy, and the Director breaks many ""rules"" in making the film.It certainly was a Make it or die style of film production.In a linear story sense, the film goes from negative to positive, and then back again; so in that respect it is different to the WEATHERMAN, but the tone still varies greatly, and has a weighty depressive tone, and as the writer-director says, he pulls people in unexpected diections.This is definitely a film that falls into the ""teachme a lesson"" sort of film.

That said, if you like dark - somewhat twisted - subject matter, then I recommend ""He Was a Quiet Man.""  Not without reservation, I have to add, because while there are interesting ideas presented here - this movie ends up being a bit puzzling.  I found the conclusion highly unsatisfying.The description on the DVD case says this movie is sort of a hybrid of ""Office Space"" and ""Taxi Driver.""  That's actually pretty accurate, but the problem is, the movie isn't as good as either of those.  A movie like ""Taxi Driver"" doesn't need to advertise it's influences - it's a unique movie that stands completely on it's own.  More often than not, when a movie touts itself as being a cross between ""movie x"" and ""movie y,"" the end result doesn't live up to the predecessors it borrowed from.I found the central theme presented by the movie to be a disturbing and a bit distasteful.  Bob (played by Christian Slater) is such a social incompetant that he would actually prefer his girlfriend to be physically disabled so she will rely on him.  Bob has struck out with women so many times, when given the opportunity to begin a relationship with a newly quadriplegic co-worker (played by Elisha Cuthbert) he embraces it wholeheartedly.  Problem is, there is little substance to their relationship other than Vanessa's need to be cared for.  This is fine for Bob, after all he obviously doesn't care about whether they actually love each other as long as she needs him to provide for her.  In Bob's mind, this is the perfect set-up:  he can control the relationship entirely, and also prop up his own self-esteem by reminding himself what a ""good deed"" he is doing.  It's all a bit sick, quite frankly.  Not that Bob is having this relationship - but rather the reasons why.None of this ends up mattering much anyway, because the ""twist"" ending is a cop-out that pretty much negates everything that preceeded it.  It is simply bad storytelling.  I can't explain why exactly, and that is for two reasons: 1) I don't want to ruin any surprises for anyone, 2) I actually still don't quite understand why the intent was.  The ending is muddled, to say the least.This really would have been a one-star review, but I do have to note that Christian Slater is very effective in the lead role.  As many reviewers have said, this is quite unlike the commonly known Christian Slater persona.  It's worth seeing mainly for his performance.

With this role, Slater joins fellow cast member William Macy in the pantheon of great character actors.Elisha Cuthbert was an unknown to me, and after this film, I want to see much more of her.

Is what you're watching real, or just Bob's fantasy? And why does he feel and act the way he does? You have to watch the film to decide for yourself.The promo statements on the DVD case say this film is a ""black comedy/thriller.""  While watching it I looked at it as a quirky drama looking inside the mind of a man who's lost control his life and on the brink of a life ending crisis.""He Was a Quiet Man"" is all those things.  At times it's a black comedy, at times it's a thriller, and at times it's a straight drama.  It felt like someone had taken ""Office Space"" and combined it with ""Memento."" (The DVD case promo text says it's a cross between ""Office Space"" and ""Taxi Driver"" so I wasn't too far off.)  Unfortunately, the excellent parts do not result in an excellent whole.  The  different approaches just didn't work.Despite the lack of cohesiveness, it is nonetheless thought provoking.  When the credits run you'll have something to talk about - alienation, gender roles (the introduction brings up male rage in response to feeling castrated by modern feminism and then essentially drops it), corporate culture, mental illness and so on.This is one of those rare films where I actually want to watch it again with the director's commentary.  I consider that huge compliment because it means I want to explore the potential meanings and ideas I might have missed the first time I watched it.As others have already noted, this is arguably Christian Slater's best work ever.  I didn't think he could act until I saw this movie.  It's not Oscar material, but it proves he has some chops.  Slater loses himself in the role so we see Bob, not Slater.It's unfortunate that the director couldn't seem to focus on what kind of movie he wanted to make.

While Christian Slater probably gives his best performance since the early 90s and Elisha Cuthbert gives the same performance she always does (this is not a bad thing, just nothing to be surprised about), William H.

He lives alone and besides being stressed-out is also mentally unstable; he sees singing hummingbirds outside his kitchen window and his pet goldfish talk to him. Bob is walked over by everyone at work and becomes fed up with his life. He hates several of his coworkers and decides to do something about it. He brings a gun to work and prepares to shoot some of his colleagues. On the day that Bob decides to go through with his plan, he's beaten to the act by another coworker, ends up shooting the gunman, saves the life of the girl he loves, and becomes a hero. The girl he saves, Venessa Parks (Elisha Cuthbert), wishes she would have died because the wound she receives leaves her as a quadriplegic. She asks Bob to do something for her that could change both of their lives forever. Yet, in the world that Bob lives in, nothing is quite as it seems and everyone around him might just be using him for ulterior purposes.HE WAS A QUIET MAN was written and directed by Frank A. Cappello. In light of the various public and school shootings that have happened in the past few years, the questions that HE WAS A QUIET MAN raises are particularly relevant, such as what causes a seemingly normal man go over the edge and take the lives of other people?, can such a person be saved?, and is there any way to stop their actions before they happen?The overall tone, mood, and setting of the film is very minimalistic. The acting is well done, especially Christian Slater who offers one of the finest film performances of his career as the troubled Bob Maconel. Slater is typically known for playboy or bad boy roles, but is completely unrecognizable as Maconel. Also noteworthy are Elisha Cuthbert as Venessa Parks who gives a star performance by using only her face and pinky.Even though I enjoyed the acting performances and some of the cinematography, I just found HE WAS A QUIET MAN to be an average movie. It is a decent drama with some fine acting and explores some important issues, but I just didn't find it all that compelling. It's a must-see movie for any Christian Slater or Elisha Cuthbert fans, but most others probably won't find it as compelling and may be turned off by the rather dark and bleak ending.The DVD offers a featurette entitled &#34;First Look at HE WAS A QUIET MAN&#34;, deleted scenes and alternative endings, an audio commentary with director Frank A. Cappello, and the theatrical trailer. I found the deleted scenes and alternative endings with the director's commentary to be most interesting. The film could have turned out much differently.",3,Fine Acting in an Average Movie,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2655,"['Poor', 'Bob', 'Maconel', 'Christian', 'Clater', 'overworked', 'underpaid', 'office', 'worker', 'alone', 'being', 'stressed-out', 'also', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'singing', 'hummingbirds', 'kitchen', 'window', 'pet', 'goldfish', 'talk', 'Bob', 'walked', 'everyone', 'work', 'becomes', 'fed', 'up', 'life', 'several', 'coworkers', 'decides', 'do', 'something', 'gun', 'work', 'prepares', 'shoot', 'colleagues', 'day', 'Bob', 'go', 'plan', 'beaten', 'act', 'coworker', 'up', 'shooting', 'gunman', 'life', 'girl', 'hero', 'girl', 'Venessa', 'Parks', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'wound', 'quadriplegic', 'Bob', 'do', 'something', 'could', 'change', 'lives', 'forever', 'world', 'Bob', 'nothing', 'quite', 'everyone', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'using', 'ulterior', 'purposes.HE', 'WAS', 'A', 'QUIET', 'MAN', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Frank', 'A.', 'Cappello', 'light', 'various', 'public', 'school', 'shootings', 'have', 'happened', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'questions', 'HE', 'WAS', 'QUIET', 'MAN', 'are', 'particularly', 'relevant', 'such', 'what', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'man', 'go', 'edge', 'take', 'lives', 'other', 'people', 'can', 'such', 'person', 'be', 'saved', 'there', 'way', 'stop', 'actions', 'happen', 'overall', 'tone', 'mood', 'setting', 'film', 'very', 'minimalistic', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'who', 'one', 'finest', 'film', 'performances', 'career', 'troubled', 'Bob', 'Maconel', 'Slater', 'typically', 'known', 'playboy', 'bad', 'boy', 'roles', 'completely', 'unrecognizable', 'Maconel', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'are', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Venessa', 'Parks', 'who', 'star', 'performance', 'using', 'only', 'face', 'pinky.Even', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'just', 'found', 'HE', 'WAS', 'QUIET', 'MAN', 'be', 'average', 'movie', 'decent', 'drama', 'fine', 'acting', 'important', 'issues', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'compelling', 'must-see', 'movie', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'fans', 'most', 'others', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'compelling', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'rather', 'dark', 'bleak', 'ending.The', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'entitled', '34', 'First', 'Look', 'HE', 'WAS', 'QUIET', 'MAN', '34', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternative', 'endings', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Frank', 'A.', 'Cappello', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'found', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternative', 'endings', 'director', 'commentary', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'much', 'differently']",He Was A Quiet Man
1118469,A3APYWXL54R4R6,B000YDBP3O,Volkert Volkersz,"[2, 5]","The first time I tried to watch ""He Was a Quiet Man,"" I had to stop after about twenty minutes. There was something about the insincerity of all the characters that I found extremely grating.A few weeks later, I picked up where I left off and watched the rest of it, complete with all the alternative endings. I stand by my first impression. This is a quirky film about an angry office worker, named Bob, who brings a gun to work and by an unexpected set of circumstances becomes a hero instead of the villain.There's not one character in the story that is particularly likable, except possibly Vanessa, who undergoes a life-changing experience after becoming a quadriplegic as a result of the shootings. A touching love story quickly becomes unraveled by Bob's idiosyncrasies.I suppose if the film is setting out to portray, as a black comedy, the profile of a deeply paranoid individual, ""He Was a Quiet Man"" succeeds magnificently. There's a paranoid edge to this psychological thriller from beginning to end. If that's what you're looking for, it's quite effective.It's just that it's not what I'm looking for when I set out to see a show. While the film is effective at what it does, I can't think of a person I'd recommend it to.",2,This Quiet Man is Grating,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,1235,"['first', 'time', 'tried', 'watch', 'Was', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'had', 'stop', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'something', 'insincerity', 'characters', 'found', 'extremely', 'grating.A', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'picked', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'watched', 'rest', 'complete', 'alternative', 'endings', 'stand', 'first', 'impression', 'quirky', 'film', 'angry', 'office', 'worker', 'named', 'Bob', 'who', 'gun', 'work', 'unexpected', 'set', 'circumstances', 'hero', 'instead', 'villain.There', 'not', 'one', 'character', 'story', 'particularly', 'likable', 'possibly', 'Vanessa', 'who', 'life-changing', 'experience', 'becoming', 'quadriplegic', 'result', 'shootings', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'quickly', 'unraveled', 'Bob', 'idiosyncrasies.I', 'suppose', 'film', 'setting', 'out', 'portray', 'black', 'comedy', 'profile', 'deeply', 'paranoid', 'individual', 'Was', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'magnificently', 'paranoid', 'edge', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'beginning', 'end', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'quite', 'effective.It', 'just', 'not', 'what', ""'m"", 'looking', 'when', 'set', 'out', 'see', 'show', 'film', 'effective', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'person', ""'d"", 'recommend']",He Was A Quiet Man
