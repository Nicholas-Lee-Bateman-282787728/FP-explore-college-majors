I think this would be an apt title.  I encourage everyone to see this movie a second time with the director's comment.  She did a fantastic  job with so many constraints, namely the money issue and a lot of really quirky stuff like Nicole Ari Parker not knowing how to drive the Range Rover.  Magenti methodically narates the movie and how it was made with a lot of effort, heart and sheer determination.  And ofcourse when you see the movie it shows thru.  I love how this movie is universal in interpreting the joys and angst of intense first love, gay or straight.  This movie was ofcourse completed twelve years ago, so the two main actresses look a little different now like Laurel Holleman, Tina in ""The L Word.""  And Parker (""Dancing in September"" and ""Boogie Nights."") The script is really tight, the funny moments are very right on and funny and the two actresses shared an amazing chemistry that didn't make the intimate moments akward, but rather sexy and genuine.

Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[21, 24]","I've been watching movies for quite some years now, but it's only been recently, within the last year of so, that I've decided to try to broaden my horizons a bit, and take chances on movies I usually wouldn't watch.  With that in mind, I've started renting some foreign movies, and began picking up movies I had never heard anything about, or starred actors I had never heard of before.  That's how I came to pick up this movie, and I have to admit that overall, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did.  I'm going to try to break the movie down into component parts, the cast, story, and things like that, and what I liked and didn't like about each.To start with, the cast.  As I mentioned, I had never heard of any of the people that starred in this movie, and to be honest, probably will never see them again, or recognize them.  The two lead characters, the two girls who fall in love, did a very credible job with their roles.  Watching them, I have to say I enjoyed watching their performances, and could believe that the two of them could possibly meet one another, find a spark of attraction there, and grow to be lovers.  Some of the supporting characters were a bit weakly played, but not all that bad, except for one in particular who fortunately, only appeared in two very short scenes.  This was the boyfriend of Evie, the African-American girl, who was very stilted in his acting, and never seemed at ease in his role, but then again maybe he was supposed to play him that way.  I don't really know, but I didn't really care for his acting ability.As for the story itself, it unfolded in a very natural way, and the script didn't seem to downplay towards the two girls, or force them to act before they were really ready, which too many teenage lover stories seem to like to do.  As a matter of fact, it's a good half way through the movie before Randy even tells Evie that she would like to hold her hand, and the awkwardness she displays there seems real to life, and further deepened my involvement in the characters lives.  Neither girl is portrayed as being stupid, as a matter of fact, they spend some time reading Walt Whitman's &quot;The Leaves of Grass&quot; to one another, and enjoy it.  By the time they do consummate their relationship, we know the two girls as well as they know each other, and fell glad for them.My main disappointment with the movie was the ending, which seemed kind of slapped on, and changed the mood of the movie.  Prior to it, I was enjoying the burgeoning love relationship the two girls were experiencing, and the end turns into a sort of slapstick farce where everyone introduced earlier in the story are brought together to a hotel where the girls have gone into hiding after having been found out.  It seemed a bit anticlimatic after the story I was enjoying, but not enough so to completely diminish the good feeling raised by the rest of the film.So, all things considered, I would have to recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something just a little bit different from what you usually watch.  If you are like me, I don't think you will be disappointed.",4,A surprisingly pleasant movie,977356800,"12 21, 2000",2000,3149,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'movies', 'quite', 'years', 'now', 'only', 'been', 'recently', 'last', 'year', 'so', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'try', 'broaden', 'horizons', 'bit', 'take', 'chances', 'movies', 'usually', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'started', 'renting', 'foreign', 'movies', 'began', 'picking', 'up', 'movies', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'anything', 'starred', 'actors', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'how', 'came', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'overall', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'did', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'break', 'movie', 'down', 'component', 'parts', 'cast', 'story', 'things', 'what', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'each.To', 'start', 'cast', 'mentioned', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'people', 'starred', 'movie', 'be', 'honest', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'recognize', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'did', 'very', 'credible', 'job', 'roles', 'Watching', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'performances', 'could', 'believe', 'two', 'could', 'possibly', 'meet', 'one', 'find', 'spark', 'attraction', 'there', 'grow', 'be', 'lovers', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'bit', 'weakly', 'played', 'not', 'bad', 'one', 'particular', 'who', 'fortunately', 'only', 'appeared', 'two', 'very', 'short', 'scenes', 'was', 'boyfriend', 'Evie', 'African-American', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'stilted', 'acting', 'never', 'seemed', 'ease', 'role', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'was', 'supposed', 'play', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'acting', 'ability.As', 'story', 'unfolded', 'very', 'natural', 'way', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'downplay', 'two', 'girls', 'force', 'act', 'were', 'really', 'ready', 'too', 'many', 'teenage', 'lover', 'stories', 'seem', 'like', 'do', 'matter', 'fact', 'good', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'Randy', 'even', 'Evie', 'would', 'like', 'hold', 'hand', 'awkwardness', 'there', 'real', 'life', 'further', 'deepened', 'involvement', 'characters', 'girl', 'portrayed', 'being', 'stupid', 'matter', 'fact', 'spend', 'time', 'reading', 'Walt', 'Whitman', 'quot', 'Leaves', 'Grass', 'quot', 'one', 'enjoy', 'time', 'do', 'consummate', 'relationship', 'know', 'two', 'girls', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'other', 'fell', 'glad', 'them.My', 'main', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'was', 'ending', 'seemed', 'kind', 'slapped', 'changed', 'mood', 'movie', 'Prior', 'was', 'enjoying', 'burgeoning', 'love', 'relationship', 'two', 'girls', 'were', 'experiencing', 'end', 'sort', 'slapstick', 'farce', 'where', 'everyone', 'introduced', 'earlier', 'story', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'hotel', 'where', 'girls', 'have', 'gone', 'hiding', 'having', 'been', 'found', 'out', 'seemed', 'bit', 'anticlimatic', 'story', 'was', 'enjoying', 'not', 'enough', 'so', 'completely', 'diminish', 'good', 'feeling', 'raised', 'rest', 'film.So', 'things', 'considered', 'would', 'have', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'something', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'what', 'usually', 'watch', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love VHS

I first caught it from the middle while flipping channels and then checked when it would be on again so I could see the whole thing.  It is a very different movie.  A tomboy, (I can't remember what her name was so for this write-up I'll call her Shawn) who lives with a lesbian mother and is taunted by everybody at school.  She also seems to be failing all her classes.  One day a girl (Evie) from her school happens into her mother's gas station.  On a whim, Shawn decides to see what Evie needs.  Apparently there is a problem with her tire.  Shawn is immediately attracted to Evie, who seems totally lost explaining her tire problem.  Evie seems to notice how Sean is looking at her and after she leaves the station, they each start thinking about the other.Evie is the opposite of Shawn.  She is very attractive and hangs with the ""in"" crowd at school.  Evie has an egotistical, pushy boyfriend and one day has a fight with him at school.  She goes to the girls room and happens upon Shawn in the bathroom.  She then pours her guts out to Shawn who is totally sympathetic.Shawn then starts telling her family clan that Evie is her girlfriend, though nothing has happened yet.  Shawn decides to get bold and writes Evie a note that she slips into Evie's locker at school.  Evie finds the note and says nothing of it for several days, while thinking constantly about Shawn.  Evie is battling her feelings for Shawn, worried that her snobbish girlfriends would look down on her if she even associated with Shawn.Evie can take it no longer and goes to the gas station where she first met Shawn and strikes up a friendship.

387992,A158U96GCWKBJJ,6303909000,Robin L. McLaughlin,"[23, 25]","I was browsing through and saw that some of the more recent reviews of this movie were ragging on the low budget quality of the film, which completely overlooks what it achieved. So I felt I needed to add my two cents on a lesbian film that will always hold a special place in my heart.If I'm recalling correctly, the budget for the movie was somewhere around $50,000. For what many people spend on a car, Maria Maggenti was able to make an entire movie of much higher caliber than one would ever expect in a world of millions spent to make schlock. In fact, for size of the budget Maggenti had to work with, it's a cinematic masterpiece. Okay, maybe that's laying it on a bit thick, but hopefully gets my point across.The directing and the acting by the two leads are actually fairly top notch for an independant film, and the lack of funds mostly shows in the details. The script and acting is a bit over the top in places, but then in a lot of ways it's supposed to be. Just look at the title of the movie. The movie lacks polish in pretty much all areas, but for a basically no-budget first attempt, that is easily forgiven.The story is heartwarming and does a nice job of depicting two teenagers coming of age who are from two completely different worlds where neither of those worlds has much respect for the other. It's also a good look at first love and all that entails, whether those involved are straight or gay.The scene where the mom comes home to find the mess is still one of my favorites in any movie just because of the unexpectedness and hilarity of it. I also think that the music during their love making is one of the best matches of music to a love scene that I've experienced in a movie, probably second only to the use of Santana's Samba Pa Ti in ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"". (Unfortunately I have no idea who wrote that piece of music in ""Two Girls"" or what it's called.)So yeah, it's a low budget film. But focusing on that blinds one to all the positives and neglects all the wonderful aspects of this movie. ""The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love"" is actually a triumph of independant film-making and shows just how much can be accomplished on talent and determination alone. It puts to shame all those movies out there made with more money, but less true understanding of what makes for a good movie. It is funny and sweet and no lesbian movie collection is really complete without it. I first saw it at an international film festival when it was originally released, I owned it on VHS, and now have the DVD version. I imagine I'll still be pulling it out to watch occasionally 20 years from now.",4,"Low Budget, Big Value",1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,2641,"['was', 'browsing', 'saw', 'more', 'recent', 'reviews', 'movie', 'were', 'ragging', 'low', 'budget', 'quality', 'film', 'completely', 'what', 'achieved', 'felt', 'needed', 'add', 'two', 'cents', 'lesbian', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'heart.If', ""'m"", 'recalling', 'correctly', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhere', 'around', '50,000', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'spend', 'car', 'Maria', 'Maggenti', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'entire', 'movie', 'much', 'higher', 'caliber', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'expect', 'world', 'millions', 'spent', 'make', 'schlock', 'fact', 'size', 'budget', 'Maggenti', 'had', 'work', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'laying', 'bit', 'thick', 'hopefully', 'point', 'across.The', 'directing', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'actually', 'fairly', 'top', 'notch', 'independant', 'film', 'lack', 'funds', 'mostly', 'details', 'script', 'acting', 'bit', 'top', 'places', 'then', 'lot', 'ways', 'supposed', 'be', 'Just', 'look', 'title', 'movie', 'movie', 'polish', 'pretty', 'much', 'areas', 'basically', 'no-budget', 'first', 'attempt', 'easily', 'forgiven.The', 'story', 'heartwarming', 'nice', 'job', 'depicting', 'two', 'teenagers', 'coming', 'age', 'who', 'are', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'worlds', 'where', 'worlds', 'much', 'respect', 'other', 'also', 'good', 'look', 'first', 'love', 'involved', 'are', 'straight', 'gay.The', 'scene', 'where', 'mom', 'home', 'find', 'mess', 'still', 'one', 'favorites', 'movie', 'just', 'unexpectedness', 'hilarity', 'also', 'think', 'music', 'love', 'making', 'one', 'best', 'matches', 'music', 'love', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'movie', 'probably', 'second', 'only', 'use', 'Santana', 'Samba', 'Pa', 'Ti', 'Walls', 'Could', 'Talk', '2', 'Unfortunately', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'wrote', 'piece', 'music', 'Two', 'Girls', 'what', 'called', 'So', 'yeah', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'focusing', 'one', 'positives', 'neglects', 'wonderful', 'aspects', 'movie', 'Incredibly', 'True', 'Adventures', 'Two', 'Girls', 'Love', 'actually', 'triumph', 'independant', 'film-making', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'accomplished', 'talent', 'determination', 'alone', 'shame', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'less', 'true', 'understanding', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'funny', 'sweet', 'lesbian', 'movie', 'collection', 'really', 'complete', 'first', 'saw', 'international', 'film', 'festival', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'owned', 'VHS', 'now', 'have', 'DVD', 'version', 'imagine', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'pulling', 'watch', 'occasionally', '20', 'years', 'now']",The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love VHS

Also it takes great care to avoid the preachy and heavy handed treatment given to many coming of age novels. The result: a dynamic product that anybody regardless of sexuality can relate to.Sure, the title may make some progressives flinch (after all, how many male chauvinist fantasies have been built on the ""amazing lesbian couple"" theme), but I was really proud in the way this movie's script was handled and thought the movie was done very respectively and tastefully. These women seek pleasure only for themselves, and not for oogling spectators who would reduce them to an exotic item. They are natural and three dimensional beings who are trying to find their place in the world.I am not very overly emotional about films, so I was unprepared for the crying that followed Evie and Randy's hidding. Because these women dared to be themselves, they encountered tremendous amounts of hatred and fear from their town. Whether it was the director's and writers intention or not, that part of the film was the most dramatic (I did not think it was comedic at all). It reminded me of the many publicized hate crimes against gays and lesbians.Granted the independent nature of the film (as well as the subject matter) made it really difficult to accheive box office sucess.

387994,A233UR4B7OT4RR,6303909000,ROFLChopper,"[1, 1]","***SOME SPOILISH MATERIAL IN REVIEW***This mid-90s lesbian gem story is whether simplistic and surely a low-budgeted affair, yet the story itself with it's blend of humor, coming of age, and first love dimensions makes this picture worth the wild to watch over and over again.  The chemistry between Nicole A. Parker (star of later Soul Food the TV show) and Laurel Holloman (star of L-Word) are undeniably strong and real.  I love the fact the two characters who are involved in a romantic connection are in an interracial pairing, I don't see too much of this kind of pairing besides Bette/Tina and Tasha/Alice from L-Word and another films I liked once upon a timeWhen Night Is FallingorThe Watermelon Womanespecially when it comes to black-white for lesbian movies or TV.As for the storyline, Randy Dean is dealing with typical high school pressures from being picked on about her sexuality to possibly not graduating cause she's horrible at math.  Evie is raised by a single-black mother but brought in an upper-middle class lifestyle, popular at school, and has a boyfriend (that is whether needy and dramatic).  While Evie has mostly everything a lot of teen girls could ask for, she finds herself far from perfect and this causes her anxiety in early parts of the movie.  I guess this is why I appreciate the Evie character a lot.  As a black person, staying ""perfect"" can be hard when so many are waiting for you to screw up and be like, 'Told You So.'  Randy, does though, supplies that special feeling and ingredient Evie hasn't felt before.  The two girls build a strong connection after getting busted by a teacher for smoking in the school bathroom, which is whether cute and open as the two characters from two totally different backgrounds being to connect.  Evie's friends, however, finds that her relationship with Randy is quite appalling and weird later in most of the film, but Evie doesn't giving into their ignorance.  Randy deals with her own insecurities as it pertains to their growing bond because she's from the opposite side of the tracks and possibly flunking out the 12th grade.  To add to it, Randy is having a side-affair with a much older woman that Evie doesn't know about to mid-way into the movie.Again, the movie is simple and even most cases to the point.  The balance of humor and teen romance makes the film a fun and easy watch that doesn't have sadness or heartbreak that some LGBT tends to have.  I highly recommend this for those who might of enjoyed their first romantic relationship from high school, college or whenever -- even if it didn't last forever.
