1072962,AU1E6KDG1FMG6,B000PUB4FA,Rebekah A. Lane,"[4, 5]","This DVD is a real treat for any Chloe fan. Chloe's singing is soft and dreamy, and her expressions and gestures natural. Her overal performance is unaffected and sincere. Filmed at various locations in Ireland, Chloe seems more Irish than I ever saw her in the sunlight, her cheeks rosy and her face shiny. Somehow she seems more Irish in these settings than in her studio photographs. The camera men could have been more imaginative, and some of Chloe's outfits looked too casual, however. I have Frank Patterson's Songs of Inspiration video, which was also filmed in Ireland, and I can't help comparing the filming of it with that of Walking in the Air. There's a lot to love anyway, though. I pop this in to watch a few songs almost every day, as it really inspires me.
