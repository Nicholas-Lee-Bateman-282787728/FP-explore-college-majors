He challenges the stereotypical history I learned in school which was dry and uninteresting. If you are not familiar with his style then you may be put off at first but understand this is about making history fun and he is a wonderful story teller and you will definitely pick up many interesting and little known tidbits. The videos are very enjoyable - the opposite of Ken Clark's Civilization was dry and boring.Also, highly recommended is Terry Jones' Crusades and Barbarians. The Terry Jones Collection was made much earlier than all of the above video sets and is not as good as his later work but still not bad. Again, Medieval Lives, Barbarians and Crusades are all highly recommended, 5 stars, and the Terry Jones Collection is 4 stars",5,He makes learning fun,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,794,"['really', 'enjoy', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'history', 'lessons', 'stereotypical', 'history', 'learned', 'school', 'was', 'dry', 'uninteresting', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'style', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'first', 'understand', 'making', 'history', 'fun', 'wonderful', 'story', 'teller', 'will', 'definitely', 'pick', 'up', 'many', 'interesting', 'little', 'known', 'tidbits', 'videos', 'are', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'opposite', 'Ken', 'Clark', 'Civilization', 'was', 'dry', 'boring.Also', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'Crusades', 'Barbarians', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'Collection', 'was', 'made', 'much', 'earlier', 'above', 'video', 'sets', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'later', 'work', 'still', 'not', 'bad', 'Again', 'Medieval', 'Barbarians', 'Crusades', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', '5', 'stars', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'Collection', '4', 'stars']",Terry Jones' Medieval Lives

An excellent view of medieval lives presented by Terry Jones is not a bunch of sound bites and redundant information from obscure experts. They get right down to the bone. The 1349 Black Death plague is also spotted.Then there is the monk. We learn the truth about monkhood. Most of the monks look like Terry Jones. We see that prayers became a commodity. We learn about bare bottom piety. There is a competition to have the best relics. There was the 1327 rebellion against a monastery; it was a preliminary to 1381.Now consider the Damsel. Also looks like Terry Jones. The archetype of the passive female. Nicola de la Haye pushing 70; she was aided by William Marshal. We get the real story with the use of puppets to keep this PG13. We have stories of women abducting men. We follow women's fashion. 1429 Joan of Arc story is told; her real crime was that she wore men's clothing.Would you believe the Minstrel? In 1066 At the Battle of Hastings, Taillefer recited the Chanson de Roland to the Norman troops while juggling with his sword. They tell of troubadours that tell stories in the vernacular. He mentions Geoffrey Chaucer who mysteriously disappears; dispatching is suspected.A knight to remember. William Marshal returns as the subject in an interesting story of his life and how he became a knight. We see them train horses to kick shields. We learn about the order of the garter founded in 1348.Shall we consider the philosopher? A medieval scientist and possibly doctor. We get a look at a field where they grew all the herbs needed for medicine. We get pictures of experiments with newer medicines. We even found anesthetics. We find Washington Irving is responsible for making us think that they thought the world is flat. Nobody never thought the world is flat. We also get to see an astronomical clock. All to display our ignorance of our own past.Stand and deliver. Not midwives but the outlaw. Terry asks ""Did outlaws never where trousers?"" We learn about ""The Folvilles"" (John De Folville 1312 - 1363 and his sons.) Among other gangs. 1150 trial by jury, but not as we know it. We get to see unique ways of execution and/or mutilation. We learn that outlaws are part of the heart of what makes England.Midlevel kings divided into the good, the bad, and the ugly. We cover three Richards. We get a spot of Richard the third form Shakespeare. He tells of the King of England that on one has ever heard of.",5,I learned about fleabane,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,2534,"['Peasant', 'revolt', '1381', 'also', 'called', 'Wat', 'Tyler', 'Rebellion', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'first', 'thought', 'excellent', 'view', 'medieval', 'lives', 'presented', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'not', 'bunch', 'sound', 'bites', 'redundant', 'information', 'obscure', 'experts', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'bone', '1349', 'Black', 'Death', 'plague', 'also', 'spotted.Then', 'monk', 'learn', 'truth', 'monkhood', 'Most', 'monks', 'look', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'see', 'prayers', 'became', 'commodity', 'learn', 'bare', 'bottom', 'piety', 'competition', 'have', 'best', 'relics', 'was', '1327', 'rebellion', 'monastery', 'was', 'preliminary', '1381.Now', 'consider', 'Damsel', 'Also', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'archetype', 'passive', 'female', 'Nicola', 'la', 'Haye', 'pushing', '70', 'was', 'aided', 'William', 'Marshal', 'get', 'real', 'story', 'use', 'puppets', 'keep', 'PG13', 'have', 'stories', 'women', 'abducting', 'men', 'follow', 'women', 'fashion', '1429', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'story', 'told', 'real', 'crime', 'was', 'wore', 'men', 'clothing.Would', 'believe', 'Minstrel', '1066', 'Battle', 'Hastings', 'Taillefer', 'recited', 'Chanson', 'de', 'Roland', 'Norman', 'troops', 'juggling', 'sword', 'tell', 'troubadours', 'tell', 'stories', 'vernacular', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'dispatching', 'suspected.A', 'knight', 'remember', 'William', 'Marshal', 'subject', 'interesting', 'story', 'life', 'how', 'became', 'knight', 'see', 'train', 'horses', 'kick', 'shields', 'learn', 'order', 'garter', 'founded', '1348.Shall', 'consider', 'philosopher', 'medieval', 'scientist', 'possibly', 'doctor', 'get', 'look', 'field', 'where', 'grew', 'herbs', 'needed', 'medicine', 'get', 'pictures', 'experiments', 'newer', 'medicines', 'even', 'found', 'anesthetics', 'find', 'Washington', 'Irving', 'responsible', 'making', 'think', 'thought', 'world', 'flat', 'Nobody', 'never', 'thought', 'world', 'flat', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'astronomical', 'clock', 'display', 'ignorance', 'own', 'past.Stand', 'deliver', 'Not', 'midwives', 'outlaw', 'Terry', 'Did', 'outlaws', 'never', 'where', 'trousers', 'learn', 'Folvilles', 'John', 'De', 'Folville', '1312', '1363', 'sons', 'other', 'gangs', '1150', 'trial', 'jury', 'not', 'know', 'get', 'see', 'unique', 'ways', 'execution', 'and/or', 'mutilation', 'learn', 'outlaws', 'are', 'part', 'heart', 'what', 'England.Midlevel', 'kings', 'divided', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'cover', 'three', 'Richards', 'get', 'spot', 'Richard', 'third', 'form', 'Shakespeare', 'King', 'England', 'one', 'ever', 'heard']",Terry Jones' Medieval Lives

If he had been my social studies teacher in high school I never would have been able to sleep in class because his presentation of all things quirky, quacky, off-the-wall and interesting come to life in this two-disk set.From his animated lessons one learns that peasants were not as dumb as we may think they were, monks were not always as angelic as the church had us believe, damsels in distress were just a figment of the church and the minstrel's life was nothing it was drummed up to be.  The church was run like a business during the medieval ages and as many monks, abbotts and merchants tried to get rich at the same time.  And if they could get away with sex, they had that, too.  But you won't find that in church documents!Jones presents the lessons with a sense of humor, appearing in each skit in era costume and dry humor.  Some of the animation appears Monty Pythonesque. But what sells this work is his use of primary source documents.

Swanson,"[3, 3]","Whilst some of the Pythons have continued to milk the MP catalog as much as possible (let's name no names, squire, nudge nudge), others such as Palin, Cleese, Gilliam and Jones have each done interestingly original things, and Terry's Medieval Lives is a fine addition to that list.I haven't read his book of the same name and thus have no idea how the two intersect, but did come across this dvd in the local library and gave it a spin. Many misconceptions about the middle ages are dispelled here, and other theories are given new life. The best thing is that TJ doesn't take himself too seriously, and manages to have plenty of fun with a topic few would think worthy of comic spelunking (unless they'd seen Python's Holy Grail...and if you haven't, run don't walk and watch that golden comic masterpiece immediately!).Some of the skits here are rather daft, but others hit the nail on the head. The best of the bunch might be The Knight, which skewers many misperceptions about chivalry and shares some most unpleasant truths about how very brutal many knights actually were. The Peasant and The Minstrel chapters are standouts as well; the latter also turns some typical historical assumptions upside down, and Terry's happy, goofy grin shows how much he really does love this topic.I do know that I would have loved seeing this in school! If you teach history and want to wake your kids up, show them some of this dvd. If only all of history was approached with the same irreverence for cliches, matched with reverence for the subject, that we find here. And no doubt about it: Jones loves the medieval period and does his best to share that love here, and when it works it works quite winningly indeed.Plus which, the guy can still make funny faces with the best of 'em.

How wrong can one get?  But then, isn't that the picture most of us received way back in secondary school when we were forced to study such things?  As it turns out, with the help of a delightful Terry Jones, those perceptions are not necessarily true.  This is a most unusual documentary that never depends upon dull lecture-type tirades, long boring speeches, or statements of absolute truths.  Instead, Mr. Jones always leaves the viewer with a whole lot of questions.  Along with Jones' command of the situation in every case, there are the incomparable standards of the BBC production team, the camera angles, and the script writers.  This mini-series is funny, informative and factual.  I recommend it to any history buff...or even to mildly curious buffs.",5,A Grand Awakening!,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,884,"['here', 'thought', 'Medival', 'Age', 'was', 'time', 'complete', 'ignorance', 'absolute', 'stupidity', 'unbelievable', 'brutality', 'How', 'wrong', 'can', 'one', 'get', 'then', ""n't"", 'picture', 'most', 'received', 'way', 'back', 'secondary', 'school', 'when', 'were', 'forced', 'study', 'such', 'things', 'out', 'help', 'delightful', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'perceptions', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'true', 'most', 'unusual', 'documentary', 'never', 'upon', 'dull', 'lecture-type', 'tirades', 'long', 'boring', 'speeches', 'statements', 'absolute', 'truths', 'Instead', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'always', 'viewer', 'whole', 'lot', 'questions', 'Jones', 'command', 'situation', 'case', 'are', 'incomparable', 'standards', 'BBC', 'production', 'team', 'camera', 'script', 'writers', 'mini-series', 'funny', 'informative', 'factual', 'recommend', 'history', 'buff', 'even', 'mildly', 'curious', 'buffs']",Terry Jones' Medieval Lives

Being a former Monty Python member, you can expect lots of dry humor. But Terry also delivers the serious side. What were knights really like? What was the condition of women? How ruthless the Church was. The injustice shown to the poor. And yet, like wasn't as bad as I thought.
