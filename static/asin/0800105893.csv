161087,A2VMT89TCSF105,0800105893,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[3, 12]","OK, let's be clear on one thing. This is *not* a good movie. It's actually one of the worst, most ridiculous and illogical movies ever made. Not even the famous actors can save it: James Mason, Sam Neill, Olivia Hussey and John Rhys- Davies. The plot makes absolutely no sense, and probably isn't even based on the novel. It's too long and too tedious, and all characters are grossly stereotyped.So why did I give it five stars, then?Because I live in Sweden, that's why!In Sweden, ""Ivanhoe"" is a pop culture phenomenon. Swedish television shows the movie every year, on New Year's Day. It's virtually an unofficial Christmas holiday tradition. When the public service network stopped showing it, one of the cabel channels bought the rights, and continued airing it, on the same date. Almost everyone in Sweden watches this long and tedious movie, eats snacks, comments on the silly costumes and weird characters, and remembers most of the lines by heart. I know I do!My favorite part of the movie is the tournament at Ashby where ""the disinherited knight"" meats the ""three noble challengers"" (the bad guys). What the crooks don't know is that the nerdie ""disinherited knight"" is actually the elite warrior Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who just returned home from the crusades. After the usual insults, all the evil knights are easily defeated by the valiant Ivanhoe. Although Ivanhoe is the supposed main character of the movie, he actually plays a minor role in the plot, fighting the crooks only at the very beginning of the story, and at the very end (when he takes on ""the knights of the Holy Temple"", a bunch of Nazi-like characters with a penchant for witch-burning). The Jewish woman Rebecca, her father Isaac, the evil knight Brian Guilbert and Robin Hood are more important characters. Personally, I just love to laugh at some of the minor characters: the fool Wamba, the noble Athelstone (who is actually a worthless bum), the fat and phoney friar Tuck, and the narrow-minded bigot Cedric, who also happens to be Ivanhoe's father.I find the movie entertaining, and since I more or less grew up with it, I wouldn't want to miss it for the world!

161088,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,0800105893,CodeMaster Talon,"[38, 41]","""Ivanhoe"" is a curiosity of literature; a long adventure novel whose hero spends most of the plot unconscious, a medieval romance with a not-so-subtle rail against prejudice, and a tale that proves when all else fails, have Robin Hood show up. This made-for-TV adaptation follows the book fairly closely, and it stars the always welcome, decidedly delicious Anthony Andrews to boot.Andrews is Ivanhoe himself, a knight back from the crusades and temporarily in disguise as he checks up on his family. His father has disowned him, you see, because the family are Saxon and Ivanhoe ran off to help Norman King Richard in the Middle East. Ivanhoe also checks up on Rowena, a childhood love now sort-of-engaged to another Saxon Lord. Things don't get very far before Ivanhoe gets injured jousting, setting off a long chain of events that will change his family's destiny.Thus begins the main problem with ""Ivanhoe"", because from this point on Ivanhoe himself is delirious until the last third of the film. The injured knight is cared for by the very beautiful Rebecca (Olivia Hussey from ""Romeo and Juliet""), a Jewish girl who is herself desired by a Norman Knight (a young Sam Neill). But she has eyes only for Ivanhoe, and actually he sort of for her, although Sir Walter Scott couldn't really get away with that plot line in his day and age (but you can tell he wanted to). Rebecca and Ivanhoe are captured by the jealous Norman and his friends, and Rowena and Ivanhoe's father too, and pretty much everybody else as well. They all end up in a castle until Robin Hood breaks them out (really).Yeah it's silly, but surprisingly entertaining as well, and I'd say if you liked Anthony Andrews in ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" you're going to want to see ""Ivanhoe"". You may also enjoy the film if you like knights in armor, Olivia Hussey, or if you're a fan of the book itself.  Definitely a cut above your average made-for-TV fare.GRADE: B+",4,"""If I could only get my strength back!""",1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,1930,"['Ivanhoe', 'curiosity', 'literature', 'long', 'adventure', 'novel', 'hero', 'most', 'plot', 'unconscious', 'medieval', 'romance', 'not-so-subtle', 'rail', 'prejudice', 'tale', 'when', 'else', 'have', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'show', 'up', 'made-for-TV', 'adaptation', 'book', 'fairly', 'closely', 'always', 'welcome', 'decidedly', 'delicious', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'boot.Andrews', 'Ivanhoe', 'knight', 'back', 'crusades', 'temporarily', 'disguise', 'up', 'family', 'father', 'disowned', 'see', 'family', 'are', 'Saxon', 'Ivanhoe', 'ran', 'off', 'help', 'Norman', 'King', 'Richard', 'Middle', 'East', 'Ivanhoe', 'also', 'up', 'Rowena', 'childhood', 'love', 'now', 'sort-of-engaged', 'Saxon', 'Lord', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'far', 'Ivanhoe', 'injured', 'jousting', 'setting', 'off', 'long', 'chain', 'events', 'will', 'change', 'family', 'destiny.Thus', 'main', 'problem', 'Ivanhoe', 'point', 'Ivanhoe', 'delirious', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'injured', 'knight', 'cared', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Rebecca', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'who', 'desired', 'Norman', 'Knight', 'young', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'eyes', 'only', 'Ivanhoe', 'actually', 'sort', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Scott', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'away', 'plot', 'line', 'day', 'age', 'can', 'tell', 'wanted', 'Rebecca', 'Ivanhoe', 'are', 'captured', 'jealous', 'Norman', 'friends', 'Rowena', 'Ivanhoe', 'father', 'too', 'pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'else', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'up', 'castle', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'breaks', 'out', 'really', '.Yeah', 'silly', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', ""'d"", 'say', 'liked', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Scarlet', 'Pimpernel', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'see', 'Ivanhoe', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'film', 'like', 'knights', 'armor', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', ""'re"", 'fan', 'book', 'Definitely', 'cut', 'average', 'made-for-TV', 'fare.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

I'm a devout disciple of Ivanhoe, and a mesmerized fan of Anthony Andrews, so it feels like treachery to say that I've never been so disappointed in a film...What a CAST.  But such meaningless drivel for dialog... True, this version DID include Athelstane, but to what purpose?  He added nothing, he was totally incidental---well, blast it, WILFRED was incidental...And, bless her heart, that cute little girl didn't look remotely Saxon...And lovely Olivia looks more as if she's distressed and confused by the quality of the production than by deep love for Wilfred or impending immolation...By the time they tie her to the stake, she looks like she just wants out under any circumstance.  I BELIEVED Elizabeth Taylor in the old version---I WANTED to believe Olivia Hussey, but I couldn't.If he'd had the lines to work with, Sam Neill could have had us rolling on the floor in tears of sympathy at his death... but I didn't even CARE...And WHAT was the deal with Robin Hood?  He looked like Cary Elwes in ""Men in Tights.""  So sad.  Such a waste. But I'm ANGRY about their little implication at the end of the film that Ivanhoe really had a hard time choosing between Rebecca and his own beloved Rowena!

I got the old version, and I got this one, because I  wanted to see if I still liked it as much as the last time I saw it - probably over 20 years ago. I emphasize that because I was taken by surprise by all the actors I had forgotten existed. David Robb as Robin Hood, Anthony Andrews as Ivanhoe, John Hallam as the Herald, Julian Glover as The Black Knight/Richard, and Stuart Wilson/DeBracy are all actors we haven't particularly heard from much 'lately.' (Maybe it's just me, maybe they've been working and I just missed it). And, as I googled, we won't be hearing from John Hallam, as he died in 2006.I still love Anthony Andrews and Olivia Hussey as Rebecca. My favorite two portrayals were James Mason as Isaac (a great character part for him, playing the victim, when he usually plays the bad guy), and George Innes as Wamba, the fool. And Michael Gothard as Athelstane (the Unready) cracked me up because here's this guy, supposedly the hope of the Saxons, hopefully in love with food and virtually nothing else, almost a coward, yet in the end, he did the right things. He actually fought at Torquilstone and gave up his rights to the Lady Rowena.I felt this version was pretty darn close to the book, as I bought the book and did a quick read on it while watching the two movie versions. I recognized dialogue from the book in the scenes from the movie. I like it when film takes a book and keeps faith with the original story as much as possible. I think there were more ways they could have kept faith with the book, but I was pleased.What I feel is important to know for today - is the PREJUDICE, the ANTI-SEMITISM and how situations can cause people to overcome those prejudices. I believe that's important in today's world where Iran wants to wipe Israel off the map.I have watched this movie once a day for the past three days. I never do that. But I've felt compelled to see how prejudice can be overcome when the need is great enough. I love that fact that it was Rebecca, the Jew, who first reached out over racial lines to care for the wounded Ivanhoe, the Catholic Christian who at times almost wished there was some way he could be in love with two women at the same time. As a result of that act of kindness, Ivanhoe then, is the only one who can save her in the end.I think we all need to see how we can reach across racial barriers to live with each other in peace, without compromising someone's else's right to exist and keep the property God gave them back in Genesis.",5,Still good after 28 years!,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,2752,"['been', '20', 'years', 'saw', 'reason', 'Aunt', 'Rowena', 'name', 'kept', 'haunting', 'last', 'couple', 'weeks', 'again', 'wanted', 'revisit', 'person', 'was', 'named', 'why', 'grandmother', 'would', 'name', 'such.So', 'splurged', 'got', 'old', 'version', 'got', 'one', 'wanted', 'see', 'still', 'liked', 'as', 'much', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'probably', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'emphasize', 'was', 'taken', 'surprise', 'actors', 'had', 'forgotten', 'existed', 'David', 'Robb', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Ivanhoe', 'John', 'Hallam', 'Herald', 'Julian', 'Glover', 'Black', 'Knight/Richard', 'Stuart', 'Wilson/DeBracy', 'are', 'actors', 'have', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'heard', 'much', ""'lately"", 'just', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'just', 'missed', 'googled', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'hearing', 'John', 'Hallam', 'died', '2006.I', 'still', 'love', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', 'Rebecca', 'favorite', 'two', 'portrayals', 'were', 'James', 'Mason', 'Isaac', 'great', 'character', 'part', 'playing', 'victim', 'when', 'usually', 'bad', 'guy', 'George', 'Innes', 'Wamba', 'fool', 'Michael', 'Gothard', 'Athelstane', 'Unready', 'cracked', 'up', 'here', 'guy', 'supposedly', 'hope', 'Saxons', 'hopefully', 'love', 'food', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'else', 'almost', 'coward', 'yet', 'end', 'did', 'right', 'things', 'actually', 'fought', 'Torquilstone', 'gave', 'up', 'rights', 'Lady', 'Rowena.I', 'felt', 'version', 'was', 'pretty', 'darn', 'close', 'book', 'bought', 'book', 'did', 'quick', 'read', 'watching', 'two', 'movie', 'versions', 'recognized', 'dialogue', 'book', 'scenes', 'movie', 'like', 'when', 'film', 'book', 'faith', 'original', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'think', 'were', 'more', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'faith', 'book', 'was', 'pleased.What', 'feel', 'important', 'know', 'today', 'PREJUDICE', 'ANTI-SEMITISM', 'how', 'situations', 'can', 'cause', 'people', 'overcome', 'prejudices', 'believe', 'important', 'today', 'world', 'where', 'Iran', 'wipe', 'Israel', 'map.I', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'once', 'day', 'past', 'three', 'days', 'never', 'do', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'compelled', 'see', 'how', 'prejudice', 'can', 'be', 'overcome', 'when', 'need', 'great', 'enough', 'love', 'fact', 'was', 'Rebecca', 'Jew', 'who', 'first', 'reached', 'out', 'racial', 'lines', 'care', 'wounded', 'Ivanhoe', 'Catholic', 'Christian', 'who', 'times', 'almost', 'wished', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'love', 'two', 'women', 'same', 'time', 'result', 'act', 'kindness', 'Ivanhoe', 'then', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'end.I', 'think', 'need', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'reach', 'racial', 'barriers', 'live', 'other', 'peace', 'compromising', 'someone', 'else', 'right', 'exist', 'keep', 'property', 'God', 'gave', 'back', 'Genesis']",N/A

Ivanhoe has always been one of my favorite books and there's always room for another good telling of it on my video shelf. As it is, I give this version three stars for unintentional hilarity.It was alot of fun watching this, but not in the way I'd hoped. Our family laughed ourselves silly over the dialogue and acting and costumes ( btw: at the tournament, whaaaat was that thing emblazoned on the herald's surcoat??! And the object King Richard was wearing on his helmet?? Anybody got a clue?). By the time Torkelstone castle had been rather loutishly stormed, we could take the pain no longer. We turned it off and put on the superb A&E; version as a sort of palate-cleansing.Maybe it's just that I've seen Steven Waddington's direct and believably physical portrayal of the returning crusader, Ivanhoe, but Anthony Andrews' version felt almost like parody. I loved Andrews as the Scarlet Pimpernel, but his Ivanhoe came off as though he didn't particularly care for the character and wasn't going to bother giving him a brain. In fact, noone in the entire production seemed to be taking their characters to heart. There was no sense of providing them with believable internal workings. And they would have needed alot of believable internal workings to overcome those costumes.The costumes and sets were so ill-informed and funky they provided a distraction (albeit a welcome one) from the bad acting. There were a number of scenes worth watching several times just to savor the breath-takingly hysterical outfits, and we did.There's nothing about this film that might make it objectionable family viewing with younger children, unlike the A&E; version.

The excellent cast, director (Douglas Camfield), and writer (John Gay) are fully devoted to the subject material. Our story is of Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe (Anthony Andrews), who has been fighting in the Crusades. He returns to find his homeland in turmoil, his father, Cedric of Rotherwood (Michael Hordern), resentful for leaving him, and his enemies ready to murder him at any second. However, their is one ray of hope - his love for his childhood sweetheart, the gorgeous Lady Rowena (Lysette Anthony) is not at all dampened. What follows is amazingly exciting, as Ivanhoe contends with his enemies, has to choose between two women, and wins back his homeland.The TV movie is expertly acted, by some of the best acting that has ever graced the screen. James Mason, Olivia Hussey, Sam Neill, Stuart Wilson, John Rhys-Davies, Julian Glover, and even some lesser knowns (at least to me), such as Anthony Andrews and Lysette Anthony - all excellent. Also not to be forgotten are the ones that worked literally behind the scenes who are contributors to all the rest of what makes this film great - the exquisite production design and costumes, the music, every bit of it is undeniably wonderful.Also Recommended: ""THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD"" (1938), ""IVANHOE"" (1952), ""THE STORY OF ROBIN HOOD"" (1952), ""ROBIN HOOD"" (1973), ""YOUNG IVANHOE"" (1995)THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF ""IVANHOE"".",5,A great adaptation of the classic tale!,1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,1495,"['IVANHOE', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'originally', 'shown', 'TV', '1982', 'excellent', 'cast', 'director', 'Douglas', 'Camfield', 'writer', 'John', 'Gay', 'are', 'fully', 'devoted', 'subject', 'material', 'story', 'Sir', 'Wilfred', 'Ivanhoe', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'who', 'been', 'fighting', 'Crusades', 'find', 'homeland', 'turmoil', 'father', 'Cedric', 'Rotherwood', 'Michael', 'Hordern', 'resentful', 'leaving', 'enemies', 'ready', 'murder', 'second', 'However', 'one', 'ray', 'hope', 'love', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'gorgeous', 'Lady', 'Rowena', 'Lysette', 'Anthony', 'not', 'dampened', 'What', 'amazingly', 'exciting', 'Ivanhoe', 'enemies', 'choose', 'two', 'women', 'back', 'homeland.The', 'TV', 'movie', 'expertly', 'acted', 'best', 'acting', 'ever', 'graced', 'screen', 'James', 'Mason', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Stuart', 'Wilson', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'Julian', 'Glover', 'even', 'lesser', 'knowns', 'least', 'such', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Lysette', 'Anthony', 'excellent', 'Also', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'are', 'ones', 'worked', 'literally', 'scenes', 'who', 'are', 'contributors', 'rest', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'exquisite', 'production', 'design', 'costumes', 'music', 'bit', 'undeniably', 'wonderful.Also', 'Recommended', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'ROBIN', 'HOOD', '1938', 'IVANHOE', '1952', 'THE', 'STORY', 'OF', 'ROBIN', 'HOOD', '1952', 'ROBIN', 'HOOD', '1973', 'YOUNG', 'IVANHOE', '1995', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'IS', 'DEDICATED', 'TO', 'ANYONE', 'LIVING', 'OR', 'DEAD', 'INVOLVED', 'IN', 'THE', 'MAKING', 'OF', 'IVANHOE']",N/A

The atmosphere of medieval England is beautifully evoked, and with two exceptions, a fine cast brings this classic to powerful life. Lysette Anthony is an insipid Lady Rowena and David Robb's immaculate Robin Hood appears to have stepped out of the wardrobe department of an Errol Flynn version of Robin Hood.

Today it seems like a different world, of course, and even in 1952 Taylor was a bit long in the tooth to play Wilfred of Ivanhoe properly, while Liz Taylor was a good 20 years younger than him and way younger than Joan Fontaine (who plays her successful rival, a lesson that even the mature women can still get a man--a lesson we heard very seldom in the 1950s).Something of the same disparity is played out here, except vice versa.  Here Olivia Hussey plays Rebecca, and she's miles older than Lysette Anthony (who must have been twenty or so) as her blonde counterpart Rowena.  This was the time of her career in which they threw every kind of British Literature part at poor Lysette Anthony, she even played Florence Dombey in a TV series of DOMBEY AND SON--with Julian Glover as her dad--funny that he's in this IVANHOE movie too, though not as her dad.  Later on American films were to use her more sensibly; she was radiant as Sydney Pollack's young girlfriend in Woody Allen's HUSBANDS AND WIVES, and who could forget her playing Angelique in the revival of DARK SHADOWS in the 1990s?  Or Lucy Westenra in Mel Brooks' DRACULA with Leslie Nielsen?  Anyhow she's wonderful as Rowena, although the conventional wisdom is that plucky Rebecca really deserves Ivanhoe more than spoiled Rowena, the dumb blonde, although anyone who's spent any time with the novel feels differently.James Mason, as Olivia Hussey's father, Isaac of York, looks incredibly aged and weak.  In that way the producers of this IVANHOE used Mason's gradual illness and really made it work for the drama, instead of putting him out to pasture he just staggers around looking as if he's on his deathbed.  Hussey looks young in comparison, and her role as Isaac's caretaker and daughter brings out all the sweetness and dignity and warmth that Olivia knows how to portray.Sam Neill is noticeably less effective than Ciaran Hinds or George Sanders as Brian de Bois Guilbert; try one of the other versions for a truly evil Brian.

In addition it has all of the colorful pageantry, fast-paced action, sword-fights, jousts, and battles that will get your adrenaline pumping.

I enjoy reading classic literature and then searching for film adaptations.  The novel can be read by an ambitious 10 year old, but it has flaws in characterization that don't hold up well for an older reader.  For example, Brian de Bois is one of the villains in the story arc, but we're supposed to accept (and sympathize with) his deadly actions at a later point in the story.  At any rate, I enjoyed reading the novel and recommend it.  It's considered an important book in the history or English literature, and its fun to visit the robin hood legend.  But there are better written novels.This particular film adaptation was a TV mini series.  It has some well known actors.  But it was directed and acted as if it was intended for the 10 year old reader.  The outline of the novel is pretty faithfully maintained.  There will always be changes in film scripts when adapting novels.  My complaint is that this just didn't have any impression of quality production or acting.  I think the reviews posted here that give a generally favorable report....are generally wrong.  The A&E; mini series (which I have since purchased and watched) is much better for making a film from a novel.  It's more realistic, with more violence.
