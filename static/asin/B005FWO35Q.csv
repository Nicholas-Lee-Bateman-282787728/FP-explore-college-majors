1459459,A24PTVSZSM8968,B005FWO35Q,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is a somewhat typical romantic comedy of the type where the two protagonists spend the movie as antagonists until they realize they actually like each other. The twist on this one is that there isn't really much fighting. In the story, the main character has inherited a house in the California wine country from a friend who passed away and he is making it into a bed and breakfast. It turns out the friend was originally Brazilian and when her son also passes away, the grandaughter who still lives in Brazil inherits the house too. Each of the main characters has a sad family story. He was married to an actress who dumped him and the girl has a brother who is always in trouble. The girl, of course, heads to California to try to sell the house. At first she keeps her identity secret but eventually the guy finds out and a brief period of wrangling over the house takes place. Both of the main characters seems like genuinely nice people and they really aren't capable of hating each other too deeply or for too long. This is actually a nice change of pace for this type of movie because it results in some nice scenes with a lot of heart. This movie is similar in production quality to a made for TV movie so it lacks a bit of Hollywood glitz but it is pleasant to watch. There are some things that are a bit of a stretch. The Brazil aspect seems a bit contrived almost as if it were cooked up to create a back story for the actress who was chosen, and some of the ""legal"" aspects of the house ownership seem a bit of a stretch, but in spite of a few things like that, it is still very watchable. The characters are very attractive and play very likable people in the movie.

However, evidently the writer was a 10 year old who has never been out of the house. Virtually no one's actions in the film ring true.This movie is meant to be an antithetical romance (boy and girl start out with major conflict, but get together anyway) but doesn't really sell that in the story, nor does the story provide any compelling reason (outside of boy seeing girl sunbath in a bikini) to really indicate what drew them together.There is a lot of law involved through the middle of the film, and none of it is even CLOSE to being right. A half hour worth of research could have saved all that embarrassment. For example, our heroine finds out that her father has died and supposedly she is responsible for all his debts. Unless she co-signed some loans, that isn't true. There isn't even any way to stretch that to make it plausible.Situations that the writer and director hoped would be zany and funny are just contrived and awkward.Characters who are meant to be funny caricatures are just annoying. Bill Engvall is completely wasted. Eric Roberts is tragically miscast as a gay hotel reviewer. Juliana Paes seems uncomfortable in most of her scenes. Julia Duffy is underused.This film is a waste of everyone's time. The only thing that saves this from one star is that most of the actors did try.

This is a quality romantic comedy with all the usual elements.  Of course, it's predictable; they all are.  If you want a fun romance with a bit of conflict between the love interests, quirky but likeable characters, beautiful scenery and a happy ending, here you go.Dean's character is fixing up a huge home that he inherited from a friend.  His dream is to open a B&B.;  He's married and still longs for his good-for-nothing and unfaithful movie star actress/wife who left him high and dry and is now filing for divorce.Now in Brazil, of all places, a sales supervisor(Paes) struggles to support her worthless brother, put up with a fun loving, self-center fiance, and try to keep her job.  She suddenly finds herself loaded with a huge debt now left by here recently deceased father.  Her friend and lawyer discovers she does have a deed to a property in the US left to her by a grandmother she never met.Of course, this is the same place that Dean believes he owns, thus the catch in the story, where all the tension and fun begins, once she arrives to lay claim to what may be hers.  He's not about to give up without a fight.The side characters including John Savage as a grumpy customer, and Eric Roberts as an apparent uptight, fastidious boarder are amusing, but the entertainment is between the leads as any good RC should be.As noted by other reviewers, they need larger subtitles.  There's not a great deal, but we had to pause to read some of them.  Once she's in the States, they pretty much speak English.  The filming and editing are well done; there's implied sexuality(with some funny, amorous newlywed Japenese) but none shown, other than some kissing; no real language; no bad people.It's lightweight fare like it should be, and we enjoyed it.
