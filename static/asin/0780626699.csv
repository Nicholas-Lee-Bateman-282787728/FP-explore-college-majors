34916,AQCAWDBNNUS1E,0780626699,A. J. Sneed,"[0, 2]","I am a big fan of screwball comedies and this film is just an average entry in the genre;  I also likeHitchcock, and some of his films are among my favorites ( Shadow of a Doubt), but this is not one of his more memorable films. Hitchcock had a great sense of humour, and it comes through in many of his movies, but he does not seem able to do more than a journeyman's job with this typical screwball premise; despite the talents of Ms Lombard.We begin the movie with a sophisticated married couple (Lombard and Montgomery) who are frequently embroiledin very unsophisticated marital quarreling. What sets this movie on its ""slow"" journey is a legal technicality has invalidated their marriage after having lived as man and wife for 3 years. The husband fails to rectify the matter as romantically and expeditiously as possible, at least as far as his spouse is concerned, and so we have a separation; and a comic setup  about the husband trying to win his wife back. Hollywood comedies were built around these simple formulas ( boys wins back girl) and with the right script, cast, and direction  sometimes the results were spectacular, but more frequently they were like ""Mr and Mrs SMith"" .... mildly entertaining.The film lacks the quick tempo of good farcical comedy, and drags on from one contrived scene to another.Lombard delivers a typical good performance, and Montgomery occasionally exhibits some deadpan charm, butthe movie just never gets out of second gear. By the time we get to the scenes in Lake Placid, I was desperately hoping this ""3rd act"" would double down and deliver some surprises, but it doesn't happen. It all ends up pleasantly without any great laughs or memorable lines.This is not a bad film and it has some ""cute moments"" and gags, but there are too many good screwball-type comedies to see before I would recommend this one. I give it 3 1/2 stars mostly for Ms Lombards talents and that fact that she  always looks great in an evening gown.",3,Not one of the better screwballs...,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,1974,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'film', 'just', 'average', 'entry', 'genre', 'also', 'likeHitchcock', 'films', 'are', 'favorites', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'not', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'films', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'great', 'sense', 'humour', 'many', 'movies', 'not', 'seem', 'able', 'do', 'more', 'journeyman', 'job', 'typical', 'screwball', 'premise', 'talents', 'Ms', 'Lombard.We', 'begin', 'movie', 'sophisticated', 'married', 'couple', 'Lombard', 'Montgomery', 'who', 'are', 'frequently', 'embroiledin', 'very', 'unsophisticated', 'marital', 'quarreling', 'What', 'movie', 'slow', 'journey', 'legal', 'technicality', 'invalidated', 'marriage', 'having', 'lived', 'man', 'wife', '3', 'years', 'husband', 'rectify', 'matter', 'romantically', 'expeditiously', 'possible', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'spouse', 'concerned', 'so', 'have', 'separation', 'comic', 'setup', 'husband', 'trying', 'win', 'wife', 'back', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', 'were', 'built', 'simple', 'formulas', 'boys', 'back', 'girl', 'right', 'script', 'cast', 'direction', 'sometimes', 'results', 'were', 'spectacular', 'more', 'frequently', 'were', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'SMith', 'mildly', 'entertaining.The', 'film', 'quick', 'tempo', 'good', 'farcical', 'comedy', 'drags', 'one', 'contrived', 'scene', 'another.Lombard', 'delivers', 'typical', 'good', 'performance', 'Montgomery', 'occasionally', 'deadpan', 'charm', 'butthe', 'movie', 'just', 'never', 'second', 'gear', 'time', 'get', 'scenes', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'was', 'desperately', 'hoping', '3rd', 'act', 'would', 'double', 'down', 'deliver', 'surprises', ""n't"", 'happen', 'up', 'pleasantly', 'great', 'laughs', 'memorable', 'lines.This', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'cute', 'moments', 'gags', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'screwball-type', 'comedies', 'see', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'mostly', 'Ms', 'Lombards', 'talents', 'fact', 'always', 'great', 'evening', 'gown']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS
34917,AO3J40SKIP7CN,0780626699,Alice Bright,"[1, 1]","Alfred Hitchcock broke out of his macabre mold to make an uproarious romantic comedy, and he couldn't have picked a better lady than Carole Lombard. Word for word and blow for blow she meets her irreverent husband head on and the results are hilarious!

Expect the unexpected, but don't doubt for a minute that this guy and this girl are hopelessly attracted to each other. Alfred Hitchcock captures in this comedy, as he does in many of his other films, the unmistakable passion that boils just beneath the surface between the characters.

Popular with both men and women worldwide,a small distinguished group of world critics saw her as the best hollywood has produced and really was treated as the queen of hollywood and its a view i share. She has remained my favorite in hollywood til this day,and is able to do so much in dialogue and conversation and remain sophisticated and charming. When I first came across her i thought i was just enthused with her,but saw the other day in comingacross her obituary on her untimely death with a flood of compliments from the literary and film world. There was something special about her. When watching her is the film good or is she just good in this performance,or both,and her dealings in dialogue and interaction is always tops,and she's attractive as well. Her death shocked america and hollywood and the gloom on  the the release of her final film caused a stir. Alfred hitchcock just came off the boat to direct her in this film anactress he loved. He seemed respectful in dealing with her and directed her in a typical american way,very unusual with him,and this kind of hands off approach is often a reason why he liked dealing with less known actors/actresses. This type of romantic comedy at which the actress excells and is well known,about whether she is married or not,and her besting of males tongue in cheek throughout is fun and she turns in a good performance. I'm interested to watch the recent dvd's on her work...years ago I saw the burned wreck of her plane,filmed as it was in its day,visited by spouse and family. It made the world so barren,as it lost its top star. We regret the many roles which she was not able to perform in and the life and adulation she missed out on...it seems like something which should not have been",5,great film great performance,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,1906,"['Probably', 'greatest', 'hollywood', 'heydey', 'was', 'carole', 'lombard', 'reason', 'taken', 'time', 'get', 'decent', 'dvd', 'boxset', 'work', 'Popular', 'men', 'women', 'worldwide', 'small', 'distinguished', 'group', 'world', 'critics', 'saw', 'best', 'hollywood', 'produced', 'really', 'was', 'treated', 'queen', 'hollywood', 'view', 'i', 'share', 'remained', 'favorite', 'hollywood', 'til', 'day', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'dialogue', 'conversation', 'remain', 'sophisticated', 'charming', 'When', 'first', 'came', 'i', 'thought', 'i', 'was', 'just', 'enthused', 'saw', 'other', 'day', 'comingacross', 'obituary', 'untimely', 'death', 'flood', 'compliments', 'literary', 'film', 'world', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'When', 'watching', 'film', 'good', 'just', 'good', 'performance', 'dealings', 'dialogue', 'interaction', 'always', 'tops', 'attractive', 'as', 'well', 'death', 'shocked', 'america', 'hollywood', 'gloom', 'release', 'final', 'film', 'caused', 'stir', 'Alfred', 'hitchcock', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'boat', 'direct', 'film', 'anactress', 'loved', 'seemed', 'respectful', 'dealing', 'directed', 'typical', 'american', 'way', 'very', 'unusual', 'kind', 'hands', 'approach', 'often', 'reason', 'why', 'liked', 'dealing', 'less', 'known', 'actors/actresses', 'type', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'actress', 'excells', 'well', 'known', 'married', 'not', 'besting', 'males', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'fun', 'good', 'performance', ""'m"", 'interested', 'watch', 'recent', 'dvd', 'work', 'years', 'saw', 'burned', 'wreck', 'plane', 'filmed', 'was', 'day', 'visited', 'spouse', 'family', 'made', 'world', 'so', 'barren', 'lost', 'top', 'star', 'regret', 'many', 'roles', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'perform', 'life', 'adulation', 'missed', 'out', 'something', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS

34923,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0780626699,Bobby Underwood,"[11, 11]","This breezy and sophisticated marital romp from the pen of Norman Krasna has a stunningly beautiful Carole Lombard in her prime and a funny performance from Robert Montgomery to make it topflight entertainment. Montgmery, who starred in many sophisticated comedies during the 1930's and discovered a new career when noir came along in the 1940's is marvelous here, matched only by the wonderful Lombard.Alfred Hitchcock took this film because it was a chance to work with her, and the results are fabulous. This film ranks right up there with ""The Awful Truth"" but is not mentioned nearly as often, perhaps because Hitchcock was involved. That is a real shame indeed. As marital farces on film go, this one is as enjoyable as any.Lombard simply glows as the adoring but volatile wife of lawyer Robert Montgomery, who spends more time follwing her rules for a perfect marriage than he does at the office. When it is discovered that their union in Idaho actually crossed a county line into Nevada and is not legal, Montgomery thinks it will be fun to have a mistress for one evening before telling her, but soon discovers differently when it backfires in his face! While Lombard gets a job and starts dating her husband's business partner, Montgomery gets some advice from a funny Jack Carson on how to get her back and spends the rest of the film trying to make her his Valentine-- or else!There are some hilarious scenes in Krasna's script played perfectly by Lombard and Montgomery. Montgomery's obsession with a bowl of soup even the cat won't eat will have you laughing out oud, as will Lombard's pretending his old buddy is with her in the cabin in Lake Placid next to Montgomery; who has, of course, followed her there, faking injury to keep an eye on her. Perhaps the funniest moment here, however, comes when Montgomery tries to give himself a bloody nose so he can squirm out of a date. It will have you rolling on the floor!This is another great RKO classic and one of the director's best. While it perhaps runs out of steam a bit late in the film, a terrific ending reminiscent of Gregory La Cava's ""Fifth Avenue Girl"" with Ginger Rogers makes it all worthwhile. Montgomery is absolutely superb and Lombard, dressed in gowns by Irene, is as beautiful as she is funny. Lombard and Montgomery are a match made in Hollywood heaven and you don't want to miss this one.",5,"""Look at that cat.

SMITH (1941) saw her under the direction of Alfred Hitchcock and paired with the devilishly handsome Robert Montgomery.After Ann and David Smith (Lombard and Montgomery) discover their wedding wasn't in fact legal, the obvious solution, to Ann at least, is to quickly get married again.  But to her horror, David seems quite relaxed about the whole affair.  Ann's mind tracks back to a recent conversation where she asked David about marriage and whether he'd do everything the same if he ever got a second chance.  His reply was to remain a bachelor instead!Ann storms out of the ""marriage"", takes up her maiden name and starts dating David's strait-laced business partner (Gene Raymond); whilst David tries every trick in the book in his quest to win her back.While this was a real change-of-pace for Hitchcock, the comedy genre wasn't completely new territory for the director, having helmed some enjoyable silents in the comedy vein like ""The Farmer's Wife"" in 1928 (and when you think about it, most of his films had some degree of comedy or a knowing comic sensibility to them).MR. & MRS. SMITH was directed as a favour to Carole Lombard, with whom Hitchcock had recently struck up a friendship.  Professionally, Ms. Lombard was firing on all cylinders, delivering some of her finest work.  She was beginning to find her feet in dramatic movies (like ""They Knew What They Wanted"" and ""Vigil in the Night"", both filmed in 1940); and was also preparing for what would be her last role, as Maria Tura in Ernst Lubitsch's comedy ""To Be or Not to Be"".  In 1942, Lombard and her mother were both killed in a plane crash, on it's way back from a war-bonds drive.MR. & MRS.

34928,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,0780626699,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[1, 1]","This is a rare comedy from the master of macabre Alfred Hitchcock. A comedy. I assure you that there is no suspense in this domestic comedy of errors that is played mostly for laughs. As a frequently battling married couple who spend an inordinate amount of time holed up while making up, Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery do a tight two step when they receive a letter informing them that they are not legally married. In an attempt to shake up Montgomery to the core Lombard snags a hunky blonde fiancee who is somewhat nerdy. It is up to Montgomery to win Lombard back before she makes the fatal error and marries the nerd. The resulting laughfest results in Lombard letting Montgomery work like crazy so she can convince him that she is worth all the hard work.With sort of a flimsy premise, this film works to an extent because the leads are good actors. In particular, Lombard is gorgeous and effervescent and so adept at playing these roles that she does it with spontaneity. However, the problem is really direction. It seems as though Hitchcock sort of let the film direct  itself. The end result is funny but lacks brilliance.My advice is to watch this for Lombard.

34929,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,0780626699,Cubist,"[26, 27]","The newly released Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection contains nine of the Master of Suspense's movies from 1940 to 1959. It's an intriguing mix of the famous (North by Northwest) and the underrated (Mr. and Mrs. Smith). All of the films in the set range from Hitchcock's early American efforts to when he had fully hit his stride in the `50s. The mix of genres is also varied, from his trademark thrillers (Strangers on a Train) to an uncharacteristic foray into screwball comedy (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) to hard-hitting drama (I Confess).All the DVDs include Making Of featurettes with such notables as Hitchcock's daughter, Pat, filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich and various film historians (like Robert Osbourne) talk about the significance of each movie and how they came to be. Also included are theatrical trailers for each movie as well.Not surprisingly, the two most popular films of the set, Strangers on a Train and North by Northwest get the deluxe treatment in terms of extras.The first disc of Strangers on a Train includes an audio commentary with several participants, most notably Bogdanovich interviewing Hitchcock about the movie back in the day and a Patricia Highsmith biographer who talks at length about the origins of the novel and its relation to the movie.The second disc features the bulk of the extras, including a preview version of the movie that was discovered in 1991 and runs two minutes longer. ""Strangers on a Train: A Hitchcock Classic"" is an excellent 36-minute documentary that looks at the Hitchcockian themes prevalent in this movie: the wrong man and the flawed hero and villain tainted with guilt. The screenplay's troubled past is examined-at one point Hitch started filming without a finished script, a practice he rarely did. Filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan shows up in his own featurette where he gushes about the movie and explains why it is one of his favourite films. ""The Victim's P.O.V."" is a seven-minute interview with Kasey Rogers who played Miriam in the film. She talks about how she got the role and her experiences working on the movie. ""The Hitchcocks on Hitch"" is an 11-minute look at the director's personal life with nice vintage home movie footage of the man spending quality time with his family that shows a warm, playful side to the filmmaker. Finally, there is ""Alfred Hitchcock's Historical Meeting,"" silent footage of the director meeting someone and then getting on a train (?).North by Northwest features a decent collection of extras. Up first is an audio commentary by the film's screenwriter, Ernest Lehman. This commentary tends to be a let down as Lehman often simply describes what we are already seeing with lots of lulls between comments.An excellent 39-minute Making Of documentary more than makes up for the lackluster commentary. Hosted by Eva Marie Saint, this doc examines the film's origins: Hitch had the idea of filming a thriller that would feature a chase across the faces of Mt. Rushmore. Lehman rose to the challenge and set out to make the ultimate Hitchcock thriller. This was considered a very ambitious and expensive project at the time but has since gone to become a classic. There are also several trailers, including one hosted by Hitchcock with his trademark dry, cheeky humour. Also included is a behind-the-scenes stills gallery. Finally, one can listen to Bernard Herrmann's memorable score on a music-only track. This is a nice touch for a film where the music plays such an important role.Fans of Hitchcock are in for a real treat with this collection. Many of the films included in this set have never been released on DVD before. Each movie features top notch transfers and substantial extras. Obviously, a lot of work went into this set and it shows on every DVD. Most significantly, this collection showcases some of the director's under-appreciated works with two of his more famous efforts demonstrating a versatility he possessed and that is not often recognized.",5,Showing off Hitch's versatility!,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,3964,"['newly', 'released', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Signature', 'Collection', 'nine', 'Master', 'Suspense', 'movies', '1940', '1959', 'intriguing', 'mix', 'famous', 'North', 'Northwest', 'underrated', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'films', 'set', 'range', 'Hitchcock', 'early', 'American', 'efforts', 'when', 'had', 'fully', 'hit', 'stride', '50s', 'mix', 'genres', 'also', 'varied', 'trademark', 'thrillers', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'uncharacteristic', 'foray', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'hard-hitting', 'drama', 'Confess', '.All', 'DVDs', 'include', 'Making', 'featurettes', 'such', 'notables', 'Hitchcock', 'daughter', 'Pat', 'filmmaker', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'various', 'film', 'historians', 'Robert', 'Osbourne', 'talk', 'significance', 'movie', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'movie', 'well.Not', 'surprisingly', 'two', 'most', 'popular', 'films', 'set', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'North', 'Northwest', 'get', 'deluxe', 'treatment', 'terms', 'extras.The', 'first', 'disc', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'audio', 'commentary', 'several', 'participants', 'most', 'notably', 'Bogdanovich', 'interviewing', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'back', 'day', 'Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'biographer', 'who', 'length', 'origins', 'novel', 'relation', 'movie.The', 'second', 'disc', 'bulk', 'extras', 'including', 'preview', 'version', 'movie', 'was', 'discovered', '1991', 'two', 'minutes', 'longer', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'Hitchcock', 'Classic', 'excellent', '36-minute', 'documentary', 'Hitchcockian', 'themes', 'prevalent', 'movie', 'wrong', 'man', 'flawed', 'hero', 'villain', 'tainted', 'guilt', 'screenplay', 'troubled', 'past', 'examined-at', 'one', 'point', 'Hitch', 'started', 'filming', 'finished', 'script', 'practice', 'rarely', 'did', 'Filmmaker', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'up', 'own', 'featurette', 'where', 'movie', 'why', 'one', 'favourite', 'films', 'Victim', 'P.O.V', 'seven-minute', 'interview', 'Kasey', 'Rogers', 'who', 'played', 'Miriam', 'film', 'how', 'got', 'role', 'experiences', 'working', 'movie', 'Hitchcocks', 'Hitch', '11-minute', 'look', 'director', 'personal', 'life', 'nice', 'vintage', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'man', 'spending', 'quality', 'time', 'family', 'warm', 'playful', 'side', 'filmmaker', 'Finally', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Historical', 'Meeting', 'silent', 'footage', 'director', 'meeting', 'someone', 'then', 'getting', 'train', '.North', 'Northwest', 'decent', 'collection', 'extras', 'first', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'Ernest', 'Lehman', 'commentary', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'Lehman', 'often', 'simply', 'describes', 'what', 'are', 'already', 'seeing', 'lots', 'lulls', 'comments.An', 'excellent', '39-minute', 'Making', 'documentary', 'more', 'up', 'lackluster', 'commentary', 'Hosted', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'doc', 'film', 'origins', 'Hitch', 'had', 'idea', 'filming', 'thriller', 'would', 'feature', 'chase', 'Mt', 'Rushmore', 'Lehman', 'rose', 'challenge', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'ultimate', 'Hitchcock', 'thriller', 'was', 'considered', 'very', 'ambitious', 'expensive', 'project', 'time', 'gone', 'become', 'classic', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'trailers', 'including', 'one', 'hosted', 'Hitchcock', 'trademark', 'dry', 'cheeky', 'humour', 'Also', 'included', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stills', 'gallery', 'Finally', 'one', 'can', 'listen', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'memorable', 'score', 'music-only', 'track', 'nice', 'touch', 'film', 'where', 'music', 'important', 'role.Fans', 'Hitchcock', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'collection', 'Many', 'films', 'included', 'set', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'movie', 'top', 'notch', 'transfers', 'substantial', 'extras', 'Obviously', 'lot', 'work', 'went', 'set', 'DVD', 'Most', 'significantly', 'collection', 'director', 'under-appreciated', 'works', 'two', 'more', 'famous', 'efforts', 'demonstrating', 'versatility', 'possessed', 'not', 'often', 'recognized']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS

34931,A315K47GRB024C,0780626699,Daniel C. Markel,"[25, 30]","The Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection includes 9 different movies.  These are not his nine best, but several are, and most  rank near the top of his legendary career.  Here are the reviews for the each movie:NORTH BY NORTHWESTNorth by Northwest is a timeless classic involving action, adventure, drama, suspense and even some well-timed comedy, all rooted from a simple case of mistaken identity. Cary Grant stars as Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue executive, who is accidentally mistaken for a secret government agent named George Kaplan. Thornhill's main adversary is a spy for a foreign government named Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Along the way, Thornhill meets a beautiful blond named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who adds a lot of sex appeal along with several surprises to this wild and wonderful plot.The movie is masterpiece for numerous reasons. The first reason is because of the some of the unforgettable action shots including Grant being attacked by a crop dusting plane in a remote cornfield and then being chased across the face of Mount Rushmore. But beyond just the action, there many brilliant scenes where Grant either alludes the people tracking him or simply just outsmarts them and does some impressive detective work on his own. The script oozes with witty and clever lines with many visually memorable scenes as well. Another strength of the movie is a powerful music score that accentuates every crucial moment in the film. Furthermore, Grant and Mason give outstanding performances, perhaps their best. The movie also breaks out of the old Hollywood overly restrained romance situations with some very forward dialogue and some sexually suggestive scenes between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint (but still extremely tame by today's standards). Finally, the widescreen color presentation is nothing short of spectacular. Not only is this Hitchcock's best, but from my personal viewpoint, it ranks #4 on my list of the greatest movies ever made behind Casablanca and The Godfather I & II. I have watched this movie at least six times over the past 25 years (now for the first time on DVD) and it still hasn't lost its edge.As mentioned, the DVD quality is utterly fantastic for a film this old. The widescreen color transfer is completely immaculate, and rich in color and sharpness - rivaling movies made today. The sound is also outstanding for a film this old. There many bonuses, but the best is the making of the film with a cross the country diary of how and where the movie was shot. There is also a very good commentary by the Earnest Lehman who wrote the screenplay.Movie: A+DVD Quality: A+SUSPICIONThe movie opens on train where Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) sits down in a private first class compartment with a frumpy young woman named Lina (Joan Fontaine). Johnnie makes an excuse that he was in another first class car but couldn't stand the smoke. When the conductor collects the tickets, he finds that Johnnie doesn't have a first class ticket or enough money to cover the difference in fare. With some slick salesmanship, Johnnie gets Lina to pay the additional fare. This is a foreshadowing of things to come. They meet again and have a whirlwind romance and get married. Lida quickly finds out that Johnnie has champaign tastes on a beer drinker's budget and uses a lot of charm and shrewd chicanery to obtain money without doing an honest day's work. As time goes on, Lida losses trust in Johnnie but later develops legitimate fears that he may go as far as committing murder for financial gain. This sets up the remainder of the film with plenty of suspense and drama finding out who the real Johnnie is and how far he'll go with his money scheming shenanigans.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for many reasons, but mainly because of the two leading actors: Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. Not only were their individual performances terrific, but also the chemistry between the two was astounding. The Johnnie Aysgarth character was a spellbinding enigma throughout the entire film. Alfred Hitchcock masterfully directed the acting so that it was hard to tell if Johnnie was a charming, but irresponsible child in a man's body or deadly sociopath. Joan Fontaine won an Oscar for her performance as the emotionally tortured wife. Nigel Bruce also did a great job in a supporting role as Johnnie's old friend 'Beaky'. Another wonderful thing about this movie is that there is a clear comical element to the film - especially when Johnnie assumes that his newly wedded wife has lots of money but finds out she doesn't. The way Johnnie wiggles his way out several tight spots is a fascinating display of his creative and spontaneous ingenuity. All in all, it's a terrific suspense film with virtually no wasted moments in the entire movie. The ending is slightly controversial only because we find out in the commentary that the ending was change at the last minute. Some people would have undoubtedly preferred the original ending. I'm fine with the released version.The DVD picture quality is nearly perfect for a movie this old. The transfer is sharp and blemish-free, with only a few grainy scenes. The sound was fine and DVD includes a bonus commentary segment about ""Suspicion"".Movie: ADVD Quality: ASTAGE FRIGHTThe movie 'Stage Fright' opens with Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd) and Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) fleeing London in a car. As they are driving off eluding the police, Jonathon tells Eve of the mess that he's in. His story in a nutshell is that a famous actress named Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich) killed her husband in their home and splattered blood on her dress and came to Jonathon's apartment for help. Jonathon explains that he ended up going back to the murder scene to get Charlotte a clean dress but was seen, thus making him the primary suspect. From this point on Eve does a number of things to protect and exonerate him including working as an operative so that she can find evidence to convict Charlotte of the murder.The film uses some shameless chicanery to misdirect the audience. To avoid spoiling the plot, my problem wasn't so much that a subterfuge was used, but that it carried on this charade for just about the entire movie (until the final few minutes of the film). But that wasn't the biggest flaw for me. My bigger problem with the film is that its obvious that Jonathan is grossly infatuated or in love with Charlotte, and this becomes crystal clear to Eve, yet she still does everything possible to help him get out of this mess. Another significant problem is that Eve, who lives in London and has British parents speaks with an American accent except when she's a spy.But in spite of these problems, Marlene Dietrich gives a mesmerizing performance that's truly Oscar-worthy. Even beyond her radiant beauty, she exudes confidence and poise in every scene she's in. Alastair Sim, who plays Eve's father in a supporting role, gives a very witty and extremely entertaining performance. If you get past the American accent, Jane Wyman does a decent job too. The movie is still very entertaining and fun to watch - again mainly due to Marlene Dietrich.The B&W; picture quality of this DVD is sharp but the presentation is marred by specs of film deterioration throughout the film. Sadly, a severe vertical scratch appearing for at least 6 or 7 seconds severely distracts the final scene of the movie. The sound was good for a film this old. The only worthwhile bonus on the DVD is a short commentary about the film `Stage Fright'.Movie: B+DVD Quality: BDIAL M FOR MURDERThe movie 'Dial ""M"" for Murder' is film adapted from a successful play. Alfred Hitchcock directed this picture and since almost all of the movie takes place in one setting, it really does have the look of a play put on film. But that does not in anyway denegrate the quality nor entertainment value of this movie. On the contrary, because of a brilliantly conceived story, coupled with superb acting, the film is terrific.The story is set in London and involves a love triangle between a retired tennis pro Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), his wealthy and beautiful wife Margot (Grace Kelly), and an American novelist Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Halliday returns to London after an extended absence and Tony knows about this affair and concocts a brilliant plot to murder his wife. He develops what seems like a perfect murder plan by blackmailing an old college friend Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson), into committing the murder so that Tony has a perfect alibi. This sets up the remainder of the film where a death occurs and an investigation is opened by the police, and Tony, Halliday and the police detectives match wits figuring out what really happened.The film is rather simple in format and even though there are several twists, the real magic of the movie is how well Tony Wendice, Halliday and the police intellectually involve themselves in the murder plot. Another major strength of the movie is the performance of Ray Milland, who plays a smooth, charming and very cunning mastermind of what seems like the perfect murder. His cool compsure from beginning to end in all sorts of troubled spots is an amazing sight to watch. When he confronts Swann with his plan, Swann seems like a trapped animal and appears to have no choice to commit the crime since Wendice has him between a rock and a hard spot. But the murder seems so well thought out that the risks appear to be minimal. Once the police are involved, Chief Inspector Hubbard played by John Williams shines as well with superb detective work figuring out how and why this killing really occurred. Grace Kelly also does a fine acting job in this film. Overall, its a great movie, but clearly a lesser challenging film for Hitchcock's cinematic brilliance. This was originally filmed in 3-D, so the movie exploits a lot of foreground/background subjects instead of showing characters and props mostly equal distant to the camera.The DVD transfer is top notch. There is virtually no film deterioration present and the full-screen color is vibrant. The sharpness is very good, but not great and there were a few times some of the subjects seems out of focus, but that's probably attributed to the 3-D technology of that era. Overall, its still an excellent visual presentation of the movie. The sound was fine also. The extras include a short documentary analysis of the film plus a very short segment on the history of 3-D.Movie: ADVD Quality: AI CONFESSI've been a big fan of Hitchcock since I saw the movie ""The Birds"" in the late 1960's and since then I thought I'd seen all of his movies on either video, TV or the big screen at some movie festivals. I recently bought the nine DVD ""Signature Collection"" and had seen all but two movies, one of which was ""I Confess"". I really didn't know what to expect and was a bit disturbed with the artwork which shows a priest holding a beautiful woman.The storyline involves an immigrant named Otto Keller (O.E. Hasse) who works as a maintenance man in a Catholic Church in Quebec. One night Otto comes into the cathedral and sees a priest named Father Logan (Montgomery Clift) and asks the priest hear his confessions. Otto confesses to Father Logan that he killed someone earlier that night. Father Logan goes to that house of the murdered man the following morning, but the police have already arrived and Logan also runs into Ruth Grandfort (Ann Baxter), a woman he knows. The police have only one lead and it appears that some witnesses saw a priest leave the scene of the crime. The plot thickens intensely as Father Logan becomes a primary suspect, and his credibility is challenged since he appears to be involved with a married woman yet because of his oath as a priest, he cannot divulge the confessions of the killer. This sets up the rest of the movie for plenty drama and suspense.This was one of those movies that sticks with you long after you watch it and gives you a lot to think about. There could be many parallels made to the life of Jesus who served and sacrificed his life for the sake of the sinners of the world (although Father Logan is in no way a Messiah). Other allegories include being ridiculed and scorned for acts he never committed or for being compassionate and forgiving for those who've harmed him. In all, its a story of compassion, sacrifice and love, but perhaps most of all staying true to your oath and calling, even in the face of death. The acting was nothing extra special, but I would say Karl Maldon was the best of the bunch. The script was superb and the picture certainly had that ""Hitchcock look"", especially in the opening segment at night. In case anyone cares, I'm not a Roman Catholic, but a Christian who attends a protestant church, yet I found this movie very inspiring. It was also refreshing to see a movie that wasn't trying to viciously scandalize the church as many movies do today. This film may be more for acquired tastes, but for myself, I was thoroughly pleased with the story, and was more challenged than entertained.The DVD quality is nearly perfect for a movie this old. The transfer is sharp and blemish-free, but seemed a tad grainy in some scenes. The sound was fine and there were a few bonus features including a commentary segment about ""I Confess"".Movie: ADVD Quality: A-FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTThe story takes place in the late 1930's where an American newspaper reporter named Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea) is assigned to go to Europe to report on the possibility of a pending global war. His editor emphasizes that he doesn't want correspondence - he wants news. So Jones goes first to England and later to Holland where he witnesses an apparent assassination of a Dutch diplomat. This starts the beginning of a wild and dangerous investigation where Jones tries to uncover all the details and people responsible for this incident.There are several things that I liked about this movie. The settings in Europe, especially the windmills in Holland, made a great backdrop to a very good plot. The underlying theme of foreign espionage with several surprising twists was also a major asset to the film. The acting was excellent and so was the cinematography. My only minor turnoff with the film was the noticeable complacency of the characters in very life threatening situations. Overall, it was an extremely relevant film, especially considering it was released shortly before America entered World War II. For me it was a very good movie but not a great one.The B&W; picture quality of this DVD is sharp and crisp but the film was clearly un-restored due to tiny specs of film deterioration showing up sporadically throughout the movie. The sound was very satisfactory. The only bonuses on the DVD include a trailer and a short feature entitled ""Foreign Hitchcock"".Movie: B+DVD Quality: BSTRANGERS ON A TRAIN'Strangers on a Train' is Alfred Hitchcock's first American movie and certainly one of his better ones. The storyline involves a young tennis player named Guy Haines (Farley Granger), who sits with another man named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a several hour train ride. Guy is somewhat of a celebrity and Bruno seems to know a lot about his turbulent personal life. At one point Bruno proposes a scheme where he could murder Guy's estranged wife in exchange for murdering Bruno's tyrannical and wealthy father. The plot appears foolproof since the each murderer in theory would be nearly impossible to track down. Guy is greatly disturbed by this proposal, yet through Bruno's distorted perspective, he seems convinced that the agreement to this devious plot is mutual. Not too long after this meeting, Bruno tracks down Guy's separated wife and murders her and reveals his so called end of the bargain to Guy. This sets up the remainder of the movie where Guy is put in a very precarious position by not only the police who view him as the primary suspect, but from Bruno who expects Guy to perform his end of the deal.This movie is a lot of fun, mainly because Robert Walker does such an outstanding job as this devious sociopathic killer. His performance as the cool and calculated murderer masked by his wealthy, refined and well-educated appearance is extraordinary. His persistence of involving himself by in effect blackmailing and stalking his pseudo partner is also well done. Another fine performance is by Marion Lorne who plays Bruno's mother. Her naivet&eacute; and constant denial of her son's clear psychological problems is a real treasure to watch. There is also some terrific camera work in this movie, clearly due to the creative genius of Alfred Hitchcock. I was slightly unimpressed with the ending, but overall, its a very entertaining movie.The DVD quality is a pristine full screen B&W; transfer. The contrast and sharpness are superb for a movie this old. The DVD comes with plenty of bonuses including a second ""preview"" version of the film and lots of commentaries and documentaries.Movie: A-DVD Quality: ATHE WRONG MANThis movie is in effect a real life documentary of man being arrested and tried for crimes he did not commit. Henry Fonda stars as Manny Balestrero, a New York nightclub bass player who is arrested for a series of armed robberies. Balestrero has a wife named Rose (Vera Miles) and two sons, so his surprise arrest puts a huge financial and emotional burden on this family. The movie is very detailed as it goes through the entire legal process of his interrogation, arrest, arraignment, legal counseling and finally his trial.This is a very serious movie and it's a clear departure from other mid-50's Hitchcock American films. The movie is shot in full-screen black and white, and has a very noir-type look. The soundtrack also doesn't sound like it's from a studio orchestra but rather a jazz band with it's very prominent score as opposed to being just background music. I liked the movie, but didn't love it. It seemed like Hitchcock went through the motions on this one but it does have a very strong ending. Overall, the film is emotionally draining and uses very little artistic creativity, but it's obvious that Hitchcock did not intend to entertain his audience but rather send a sobering message regarding how fragile life is. To it's credit, the film also reveals a message of divine intervention when we turn to God in our time of deepest pain.The DVD transfer very sharp but some tiny deterioration was noticeable periodically throughout the film. The sound is excellent as the music soundtrack sets an important tone to the movie. The extras include a short documentary analysis of the film.Movie: BDVD Quality: B+MR. & MRS. SMITHThis was Hitchcock's first and last attempt of directing a comedy. 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is a comical farce about a married couple named Anne (Carole Lombard) and David Smith (Robert Montgomery) who clearly have some relationship issues since Anne has an established pattern of spending days at a time in bed anytime she has a disagreement with her husband. After making up from their latest tiff, Anne asks David, ""If given the chance to go back in time would you marry me again""? His instant response is ""No"", but then realizes he's made a terrible gaff and unsuccessfully tries to cover his tracks, but at least does enough damage control to keep them together. Shortly after David learns that through a legal snafu, their marriage is void. When Anne learns about this legal wrinkle, she separates and this sets up a cat and mouse game between the two seeing if they can salvage their relationship.As much as I like Hitchcock and Carole Lombard, both Hollywood legends in their own right, I can't say this movie worked magic for me. I do know that films like this were very popular in their day, but I didn't find any of it laugh-out-loud funny, although some of scenes put a smile on my face. I did like the slice of life look of the film as it showed many interesting backdrops including several original interior shots plus scenes at an amusement park and a ski resort. If you like screwball comedies from this era, you will probably be very entertained with the film. If you don't like that type of humor, or hope to find lots of Hitchcock's creative artistry and cinematic brilliance, you will probably be disappointed with the film.The B&W; picture quality of this DVD is sharp and crisp but tiny specs of film deterioration showed up sporadically throughout the movie. The sound was very satisfactory for a film this old. The only bonus on the DVD is a short commentary about the film.Movie: CDVD Quality: B+",5,A wonderful assortment of some of his best along with some lesser known works,1126656000,"09 14,

34933,A1TBI0PSDYV75P,0780626699,"D. M. Nece ""ivojnob""","[5, 19]","Alfred Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors of all time and probably my personal favorite.  I have found genius in every movie he has ever done, except for this one.  Mr. and Mrs. Smith creates characters that come across more evil than misunderstood with the exception of Mr. Smith.  He is misunderstood and his life is turned upside down over it, so you do feel for him.  However, the other two main characters in the movie, Mrs. Smith and his best friend, are the type of people you don't want in your life.  Unfortunately for Mr. Smith, these are the two most important people in his life, two people that selfishly drop him like a bad habit for their own selfish motives.  Mrs. Smith is never even in love with the friend, yet she is willing to marry him. Had Mrs. Smith been made an antagonist, I probably could have loved this film. Instead we are to hope for her happiness as well.I am also a big fan of Angelina Jolie, so when I heard about a remake of a Hitchcock classic I had never seen, I was excited.  I held off watching this one til I saw the new Jolie/Pitt version, which made no difference as they were nothing alike.  The new movie was an extremely enjoyable film.  It was meant to be sexy, fun, and absurd, and it worked on all three levels.  Hitchcock's movie worked on none of these levels.  And I have found more comedy in most of his suspense movies.  It also lacked the sarcastic element of The Trouble With Harry, which could have made this a far better movie.

34934,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0780626699,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","It's impossible to take your eyes off Carole Lombard. Not only was she among the most effervescent of screen comediennes during Hollywood's golden age, at 32, she was simply that beautiful in this 1941 film strikingly transferred onto DVD. This was her penultimate film, released less than a year before her tragic death in a plane crash, but it provides a nice, if not spectacular, showcase for her skills in both screwball and drawing room comedy. As Ann and David Smith, a volatile married couple who find out that their marriage is not legal due to a jurisdiction technicality, Lombard co-stars with Robert Montgomery, who excelled in light comedy but remains relatively forgotten today compared to his peers, Cary Grant and William Powell.At first glance, it is amazing to believe that Alfred Hithcock directed this confection given the master of suspense was between two classics, ""Rebecca"" and ""Shadow of a Doubt"", but if you look closely enough, you will likely notice quite a few of his touches, including his cameo walk-on appearance in front of the Smiths' 72nd Street apartment building. There is an occasional odd close-up, for instance, of a lamp cord that Ann trips over, or subtly threatening scenes, such as when Ann shaves David with an open razor or when Ann and her suitor get stuck high above a crowd in a parachute ride - all these moments seem Hitchcokian in hindsight. However, it's really the clever though predictable script by Norman Krasna and the romantic sparring of the leads that dominates the film.The bulk of the story is how David tries to win back Ann, who is smarting from the fact that David did not let her know they were not legally married. She finds out from the clerk who was assigned to inform the married couple of their illegal status since he is from her hometown. In the meantime, David is forced to stay at his men's club (the norm for thirties comedies), while Ann is courted by his law partner Jefferson, who is the epitome of Southern gentility. Plenty of shenanigans ensue until the inevitable ending, though the pacing of the film feels sluggish at times, which is a shame given its relatively short 95-minute running time. At the same time, I think this may have been intentional since it seems ultimately more a character-driven comedy than a situation-derived farce.Montgomery lacks Grant's erudite manner and physical dexterity, but he has an easy, pugnacious charm. Playing the stock Ralph Bellamy, third-wheel role, Gene Raymond - perhaps best known for romancing Dolores Del Rio in the first Astaire-Rogers musical, ""Flying Down to Rio"" - is a surprisingly sturdy comic foil as Jefferson. Along with the original trailer, the DVD package includes an informative sixteen-minute documentary, ""Mr. Hitchcock Meets the Smiths"", produced just in 2004. It includes comments from directors Peter Bogdanovich and Richard Franklin; film historians Robert Osborne and Richard Schickel; Hitchcock's daughter Pat; and his granddaughter Mary. They all wax fondly on the master director's dry, sometimes caustic sense of humor and how it came in handy making this film. This comedy is not in the same league as other screwball comedies such as ""Bringing Up Baby"" or Lombard's cherished ""My Man Godfrey"". However, any time Lombard shows up, the screen simply lights up. What a tragedy that she didn't have a longer career.",4,Predictable Marital Farce Showcases Lombard at Her Most Luminous,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,3368,"['impossible', 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'most', 'effervescent', 'screen', 'comediennes', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'age', '32', 'was', 'simply', 'beautiful', '1941', 'film', 'strikingly', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'was', 'penultimate', 'film', 'released', 'less', 'year', 'tragic', 'death', 'plane', 'crash', 'nice', 'not', 'spectacular', 'showcase', 'skills', 'screwball', 'drawing', 'room', 'comedy', 'Ann', 'David', 'Smith', 'volatile', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'marriage', 'not', 'legal', 'due', 'jurisdiction', 'technicality', 'Lombard', 'co-stars', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'who', 'excelled', 'light', 'comedy', 'relatively', 'forgotten', 'today', 'compared', 'peers', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'William', 'Powell.At', 'first', 'glance', 'amazing', 'believe', 'Alfred', 'Hithcock', 'directed', 'confection', 'given', 'master', 'suspense', 'was', 'two', 'classics', 'Rebecca', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'look', 'closely', 'enough', 'will', 'likely', 'notice', 'quite', 'few', 'touches', 'including', 'cameo', 'walk-on', 'appearance', 'front', 'Smiths', '72nd', 'Street', 'apartment', 'building', 'occasional', 'odd', 'close-up', 'instance', 'lamp', 'cord', 'Ann', 'trips', 'subtly', 'threatening', 'scenes', 'such', 'when', 'Ann', 'David', 'open', 'razor', 'when', 'Ann', 'suitor', 'get', 'stuck', 'high', 'crowd', 'parachute', 'ride', 'moments', 'seem', 'Hitchcokian', 'hindsight', 'However', 'really', 'clever', 'predictable', 'script', 'Norman', 'Krasna', 'romantic', 'sparring', 'leads', 'film.The', 'bulk', 'story', 'how', 'David', 'win', 'back', 'Ann', 'who', 'smarting', 'fact', 'David', 'did', 'not', 'let', 'know', 'were', 'not', 'legally', 'married', 'out', 'clerk', 'who', 'was', 'assigned', 'inform', 'married', 'couple', 'illegal', 'status', 'hometown', 'meantime', 'David', 'forced', 'stay', 'men', 'club', 'norm', 'thirties', 'comedies', 'Ann', 'courted', 'law', 'partner', 'Jefferson', 'who', 'epitome', 'Southern', 'gentility', 'Plenty', 'shenanigans', 'ensue', 'inevitable', 'ending', 'pacing', 'film', 'feels', 'sluggish', 'times', 'shame', 'given', 'relatively', 'short', '95-minute', 'running', 'time', 'same', 'time', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intentional', 'ultimately', 'more', 'character-driven', 'comedy', 'situation-derived', 'farce.Montgomery', 'Grant', 'erudite', 'manner', 'physical', 'dexterity', 'easy', 'pugnacious', 'charm', 'Playing', 'stock', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'third-wheel', 'role', 'Gene', 'Raymond', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'romancing', 'Dolores', 'Del', 'Rio', 'first', 'Astaire-Rogers', 'musical', 'Flying', 'Down', 'Rio', 'surprisingly', 'sturdy', 'comic', 'foil', 'Jefferson', 'original', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'package', 'informative', 'sixteen-minute', 'documentary', 'Mr.', 'Hitchcock', 'Smiths', 'produced', 'just', '2004', 'comments', 'directors', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'Richard', 'Franklin', 'film', 'historians', 'Robert', 'Osborne', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'Hitchcock', 'daughter', 'Pat', 'granddaughter', 'Mary', 'wax', 'fondly', 'master', 'director', 'dry', 'sometimes', 'caustic', 'sense', 'humor', 'how', 'came', 'handy', 'making', 'film', 'comedy', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'other', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'such', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', 'Lombard', 'cherished', 'Man', 'Godfrey', 'However', 'time', 'Lombard', 'up', 'screen', 'simply', 'up', 'What', 'tragedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'longer', 'career']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS

They are not based on one another. the only thing they have in common is the title.This stroy is a classic comedy about a married couple, now going on three years, who have hit a roadblock in their relationship. The husband, after slacking off from work, is trying to settle an arguement between him and his wife. Three days pass until they finally make up. When at Breakfest, the wife asks hypothetically if he was still single would he still marry her. He responds honestly, ""I would have done things different."" She seems upset but he recovers by saying, ""We're only talking hypothetically, dear.""Then, after coming back to his office, he is introduced to a man who admits to him that his marriage to his wife is not legal anymore. They would have to re-marry. This tingles the husbands rambunctious side and he intends to keep it a secret, but little does he know that the man, mr. deaver, visits his wife as well and delivers the news.After realizing that her husband is pulling the wool over her eyes, she plans to change things. He gets thrown out of his own apartment, she changes the name on the door to her maiden name, she gets a job to provide herself. The husband, meanwhile, is trying to come up with a scheme to marry her back becuase, naturally, of course, he loves her still.What ensues is a battle of the sexes as these two argue and banter like a married couple, even though they are not legally wed. He even tries to get back at her by going out on a date with someone but things don't go as planned, like always. You'l laugh for hours the club scene where he tries to come up with an excuse to leave becuase his wife is there. I won't spoil it, but just keep your eye on the pepper shaker. It's hilarious.She even tries the same, courting his buddy lawyer. A funny love traingle of laughs. Each antic and slapstick gag in this movie is gut-busting funny. Alfred Hitchcock has a really good funny bone. This was his rare comedy.Many will sympathize with both the husband and the wife, but you'll melt just seeing how good this duo is even when they're fighting.Snappy dialogue and laughs in all the right places. this is one movie that is re-watchable.

34937,A8V74RZY8TIRJ,0780626699,"Forrest C. Hopson ""StarWatcher""","[2, 2]","""Alfred Hitchcock: The Signature Collection"" gathers nine classic films from the director best known for his suspense and film noir expertise!""Strangers On A Train"" (1951)  (2 disc Special Ediiton)Psychotic mother's boy Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meets famous tennis professional Guy Haines (Farley Granger) on a train. Guy wants to move into a career in politics and has been dating a senator's daughter, Ann Morton, (Ruth Roman) while awaiting a divorce from his wife, Miriam (Kasesy Rogers). Bruno wants to kill his father, but knows he will be caught because he has a motive. Bruno dreams up a crazy scheme whereby he and Guy exchange murders. Guy takes this as a joke, but Bruno is serious and takes things into his own hands.  Classic Hitchcock suspense has everything that suspense fan could ask for- great script, perfect cast, and an over-the-top finale!  It even co-starred Hitchcock's own daughter, Patricia Hitchcock as Ruth Roman's on screen sister, Barbara Morton.  It's also nice to see Marion Lorne (Aunt Clara from TV's ""Bewitched"") playing Robert Walker's on screen Mother.  Each performance here is solid and gives the film a true sense of believability as the tension builds in each scene.  The film's finale takes place in an amusement park and is still one of the best ever!""North By Northwest"" (1959)New York advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is kidnapped by a gang of spies led by Philip Vandamm, (James Mason) who believes Thornhill is CIA agent George Kaplan. Thornhill escapes, but must find Kaplan in order to clear himself of a murder it is believed he committed. Following Kaplan to Chicago as a fugitive from justice, Thornhill is helped by beautiful Eve Kendall. (Eva Marie Saint) In Chicago, she delivers a message to Kaplan that almost costs Thornhill his life when a crop-dusting plane thrillingly chases him across a cornfield!  One of the crown jewels of the Hitchcock suspense films and justly so, with standout performances by Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason.  The infamous ""Mount Rushmore"" chase scene is still quiet breathtaking to behold!""Dial `M' For Murder"" (1954)Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) learns that his wife, Margo (Grace Kelly) had an affair but even though it's over, he decides to kill her but chooses to bid his time. He waits until Mark Halliday, (Robert Cummings) his wife's lover, returns to town. He then begins to put his plan into play. He summons a man, who he is sure, will carry out his plan, for he recalls him from his college years. Explaining what he believes to be `the perfect murder,' he gets the man to agree to kill his wife. The night of his wife's murder is played out brilliantly and the suspense factor goes from 0 to 100 as Margo fights for her life and in the struggle takes the life of her would-be-killer!  Tony, trying to cover everything up, decides then to make it appear that Margo had an ulterior motive for killing the man. And it appears to be working except Halliday doesn't believe she's guilty and the police uncover a few anomalies.  Truly one of the underappreciated Hitchcock classics with Milland, Kelley, and Cummings in top form!  The leading Scotland Yard Detective Hubbard, is played brilliantly by British actor John Williams, who gives ""Dial M For Murder"" an extra shot of class!  It's really clever how each piece of the murder puzzle is discovered throughout the film and makes you want to see it again, just to see it all unfold once more!""Foreign Correspondent"" (1940)Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea) is an action reporter on a New York newspaper. The editor appoints him European correspondent because he is fed up with the dry, reports he currently gets. Johnny's first assignment is to get the inside story on a secret treaty agreed between two European countries by the famous diplomat, Mr. Van Meer. (Albert Bassermann) An assassination of a foreign government official begins the spiraling espionage that Johnny finds himself submerging in, taking the viewer along for the ride!  Johnny enlists the help of a young woman, Caroll Fisher (Laraine Day) to help track down a group of spies as the story progresses into one of Hitchcock's best espionage adventures!""Suspicion"" (1941)Johnny Aysgarth (Cary Grant) is a handsome gambler who seems to live by borrowing money from friends. He meets shy Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) on a train whilst trying to travel in a first class carriage with a third class ticket. He begins to court Lina and before long they are married. It is only after the honeymoon that she discovers his true character and she starts to become suspicious when Johnny's friend and business partner, Beaky (Nigel Bruce) is killed mysteriously.  The story builds with suspense as you keep guessing, along with Lina, could Johnny truly be a cold-hearted murderer or am I just imagining things?  ""Suspicion"" is Joan Fontaine's second Hitchcock film, following her brilliant performance in 1939's ""Rebecca.""  Cary Grant is, as always, suave and debonair, bringing his character to the front as either cunningly evil or simply misunderstood.  Joan Fontaine had a quality about her that made you want to protect her from the menaces on the screen, and I believe that this is what endured her to movie audiences in films like ""Rebecca"" and `Suspicion.""  Another great suspense film from the master of suspense, however, I would have preferred the original ending to ""Suspicion,"" as I'm sure Mr. Hitchcock would have preferred as well.""The Wrong Man"" (1956)The true story of Manny Balestrero (Henry Fonda), a musician unjustly accused of armed robbery.  In classic Hitchcock form, Balestrero vehemently protests his innocence but acts thoroughly guilty, leading a host of policemen and witnesses to finger him as the thief. The trial goes badly for Manny, but life is worse for his wife, Rose (Vera Miles), who falls apart under the strain of his ordeal.  With intense and heartbreaking performances from both Fonda and Miles,  ""The Wrong Man"" is more of a testament to what can happen when a person is submerged in a case of ""mistaken identity.""  Hitchcock brings Manny's story to life with great camera angle shots and the b&w; cinematography is top notch throughout.  Not your typical Hitchcock suspense film, but essential for its star's performances and Hitchcock's dead on direction.""Stage Fright"" (1950)Eve Gill (Jane Wyman), an aspiring young actress, shelters a fellow acting student, Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd), from the police. He is suspected of murdering the husband of his mistress, Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich), a famous singer. Jonathan claims that he became implicated when he tried to help Charlotte destroy the evidence. Eve's eccentric father, Commodore Gill (Alastair Sim), agrees to hide Jonathan in his house while she proves his innocence. To do this, Eve becomes Charlotte's temporary maid. Eve's Father devises a plan to force Charlotte to confess in front of the inspector investigating the case, Wilfred Smith (Michael Wilding). When the plan doesn't work, Eve tries blackmailing Charlotte into a confession while the police listen outside her dressing room. Charlotte agrees to pay, but insists that Jonathan is the real killer.  ""Stage Fright"" has that spark of suspense, which captures you from the very beginning.  Jane Wyman brings a Nancy Drew-like character to her role, as the energetic Eve.  In search of both romance and redemption for the innocent, Eve takes charge in this fun and thought provoking Hitchcock classic!""I Confess"" (1953)In Quebec City, Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) is accused of killing a well-known lawyer. The priest knows the murderer, but he can't reveal his identity because the man confessed the crime to him in the confessional.  So begins Hitchcock's ""I Confess,"" with stellar performances throughout and top notch suspense as Father Logan is set to unravel the web of deceit and murder that he has found himself caught up in.  In true Hitchcock fashion, ""I Confess"" takes its audience on a well-rounded ride of suspense with criminals caught up in their sins of murder and persecuting the innocent.  In this case, a Catholic priest, who is at odds with being able to tell the identity of the real murderer in court or keeping his vows to the Church and not revealing the confessional which was told to him by the true killer!""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (1941)Sophisticated New York couple David (Robert Montgomery) and Annie Smith (Carole Lombard) have an unusual marriage with an inordinate number of rules and regulations. One rule entitles them to ask each other one question per month, which the other must answer completely and honestly. Annie asks David if he would marry her again if he could do it over again and David confides that he misses his freedom and so he probably wouldn't. Later that day, an official from the town where they got married calls to see David. He explains that owing to a state boundary dispute, all couples married between 1936 and 1939 in the county were not legally married. David decides to have fun with this fact, but unbeknown to him, the county official calls to see Annie too and disaster results. Not at all your typical Hitchcock film!  ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is more on the lighthearted, romantic comedy category, than anything obtaining to suspense whatsoever.  It's inclusion here is purely of the fact that it was directed by Hitchcock and therefore rounded out the `box set.'  Still an enjoyable picture with Montgomery and Lombard giving fine performances as love struck newlyweds having a bit of a squabble.  A rare film from the Master of suspense, indeed!",5,9 CLASSIC GEMS FROM THE MASTER OF SUSPENSE!,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,9626,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Signature', 'Collection', 'gathers',

He says that this doesn't mean that he would like to marry someone else: He simply would enjoy the life of the bachelor again.By a freak of the law, it turns out that their 3-year marriage is legally invalid. To him, this is simply a matter of the formality of a new marriage. To her, however, this is a chance to dump him and find someone new. Or so it seems...Mr. Smith is told by another man that it is ""really bad"" when the man is forced out of his house for two nights instead of just one. Mrs. Smith reverts to her maiden name, and starts dating other men. He follows her around, trying to persuade her that he loves her and would want to marry her anew. He says that his very pursuit of her proves that he loves her and wants her. But she remains aloof and resistant. Some viewers may see in Mrs. Smith a portrayal of women as fickle, impossible to please, unable to make up their minds, and even flippant and childish.And so it goes.

34941,AT04V4H3AO3T5,0780626699,Jeremy W. Forstadt,"[0, 0]","MR AND MRS SMITH is an entertaining though not spectacular film. It is very easy to see this film and not realize that it was directed by Alfred Hitchcock because, frankly, it does not have that Hitchcock feel to it, to say the least. It is a silly little comedy, but it does star Carole Lombard as Mrs. Smith and that alone would make any film worth viewing. However, Robert Montgomery, in my opinion, even outshines Ms. Lombard in his role as Mr. Smith.The plot if the story is very simple. Mrs. Smith adoringly asks her husband of three years, ""If you had it all to do over again, would you still have married me?"" When Mr. Smith answers ""Honestly, no,"" he sets himself up for the doghouse. Remarkably, the very next day, it is revealed that through a geographical technicality, it turns out that Mr. and Mrs. Smith were never legally married at all. Mrs. Smith wastes no time in kicking Mr. Smith out on the curb. Hijinks ensue.The humor in this movie feels a bit dated, but it still works. Mrs. Smith comes off as ludicrously capricious, but one is not expecting great art here. In fact, MR AND MRS SMITH, at times, feels like an extended episode of I LOVE LUCY at times. I would hardly consider this to be a classic, but it is worth a viewing, particularly if you want to see a different side of Hitchcock or just enjoy the comic stylings of Lombard and Montgomery.Jeremy W.

Nearly all of his movies are great.  In my opinion, he's the greatest director of all time.  Second place would have to go to Spielberg.  Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941) is a so-called ""screwball comedy"" that stars Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery.  I would instead classify it as a ""romantic comedy"".  To me, this movie is rather flat.  The humor fell a little flat with me.  There were some funny moments, but they didn't have me laughing out loud.  The movie seems inconsistent throughout and somewhat predictable.  This comedy movie was an experiment by Hitchcock.  He only did one other comedy - The Trouble With Harry (1955), and that was a ""black comedy"".  I think Hitchcock was a funny guy generally speaking, but I think his humor works a lot better when it is used sparingly in his movies.  Every Hitchcock movie has a couple of light moments sprinkled in.  It's designed to let the audience breathe a little.  Even some of Hitchcock's cameo appearances are humorous, for example his appearances in North By Northwest (1959), To Catch A Thief (1955), and Stage Fright (1950).  Some of his trailers are humorous as well, the best example being Frenzy (1972).  But I think doing straight up comedies wasn't Hitchcock's thing, for the most part.  Mr. & Mrs. Smith doesn't feel like a typical Hitchcock movie.  The trademark suspense is largely absent.  The trademark Hitchcock darkness is absent as well.For me, the biggest reason to watch this movie is Carole Lombard.Overall, this is a so-so Hitchcock movie that I can't give a full recommendation for.

34947,A1LBBULBEREVEF,0780626699,Kathy Fennessy,"[2, 4]","It would seem that the great Alfred Hitchcock felt obligated to make a screwball comedy, since it was all the rage in the thirties and forties. Despite the best efforts of a talented cast, however, this is a pretty charmless affair.Oddly enough, Hitchcock's Suspicion, which was released the same year, also concerns a marriage lacking in trust, but it's considerably more successful. Maybe that's because it's easier to sympathize with and care about Joan Fontaine's character in that movie (and in his classic, Rebecca).In Suspicion, Fontaine tries desperately to trust Cary Grant--who may or may not have married her for her money--whereas both of the the characters in Mr. and Mrs. Smith, played by Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery, lack trust in the other. That made them both unsympathetic to me, whereas the guileless Gene Raymond seemed all the more appealing in comparison, but he's presented as more of a rube (a bit like Ralph Bellamy, who always lost the girl to Grant) than as a serious contender for a sophisticated lady's affections.If you're a Hitchcock fanatic, as I am, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith is a must simply because it reveals a different side of the man, but if what you're really looking for is a first-rate screwball comedy, look no further than Howard Hawks' Twentieth Century, also with Lombard, or His Girl Friday, with Grant and Rosalind Russell.",3,Trifle from The Master,958176000,"05 13, 2000",2000,1375,"['would', 'seem', 'great', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'felt', 'obligated', 'make', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'was', 'rage', 'thirties', 'forties', 'best', 'efforts', 'talented', 'cast', 'however', 'pretty', 'charmless', 'affair.Oddly', 'enough', 'Hitchcock', 'Suspicion', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'also', 'marriage', 'lacking', 'trust', 'considerably', 'more', 'successful', 'Maybe', 'easier', 'sympathize', 'care', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'character', 'movie', 'classic', 'Rebecca', '.In', 'Suspicion', 'Fontaine', 'desperately', 'trust', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'married', 'money', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'played', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'lack', 'trust', 'other', 'made', 'unsympathetic', 'guileless', 'Gene', 'Raymond', 'seemed', 'more', 'appealing', 'comparison', 'presented', 'more', 'rube', 'bit', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'who', 'always', 'lost', 'girl', 'Grant', 'serious', 'contender', 'sophisticated', 'lady', 'affections.If', ""'re"", 'Hitchcock', 'fanatic', 'am', 'Mr.', 'amp', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'must', 'simply', 'different', 'side', 'man', 'what', ""'re"", 'really', 'looking', 'first-rate', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'look', 'further', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'also', 'Lombard', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'Grant', 'Rosalind', 'Russell']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS

34949,A6ADO7B6FUVN,0780626699,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[12, 14]","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a very different kind of film compared to Alfred Hitchcock's other films.  The first obvious difference that strikes the audience is the absence of murder or other wicked elements.  Instead Hitchcock created a comedy with Carole Lombard whom he held in high esteem.  Lombard made several great films during the 1930s among these My Man Godfrey (1936), unfortunately she passed away in a plane crash at the age 33.  Nonetheless, she left the world with a number of wonderful performances one of which can be seen in Mr. & Mrs. Smith while leaving the legacy of being the queen of screwball comedy for people to reminiscence.The camera captures a hotel room with several dirty plates with half eaten deserts and meals in the beginning of the film while slowly panning towards an rough looking David Smith (Robert Montgomery) who is playing solitaire.  It is obvious that David tries to silently squander some time while waiting for his wife Ann (Carole Lombard) to get up from the bed.  David studies Ann who has cocooned herself with the blanket, as he knows that she is pretending to sleep. Simultaneously, room service knocks on the door with breakfast.  Ann peaks out from under the blanket when David receives the breakfast, but rolls over to overtly express her silent contempt for some unknown reason.  Her husband, on the other hand, seems to be used to this, as he merely picks up his breakfast and silently moves away from her in order to let her calm down.The opening set up displays Hitchcock's ingenious story telling technique, as he creates intrigue and a clear beginning of the film.  In addition, the framing and mise-en-scene are exceptional throughout the film, which helps enhance the messages in the film.  Several different notions can be deduced from this scene such as that they are married, there is tension between them, and both expect one another to be able to do the right thing without communication.  Yet, Ann and David find a way to fix the quarrel between them, which has gone on for three days.  This suggests that they took the ceremony when they said, ""until death do us part"", very seriously, as they work things out.Shortly after the opening, Hitchcock displays an interesting scene where Ann shaves David.  It displays tremendous trust that David has for Ann, as she carefully shaves him with a sharp blade.  Maybe this could draw some suggestive thoughts to the shower scene in Psycho of what could happen, if she still was angry with him.  However, this is a comedy and it will not happen, yet the idea still lingers in the mind for those who have seen other Hitchcock films.  Instead,  Ann talks about faithfulness, honesty, and other decent concepts that generate a healthy marriage.  In the following scene Ann warms her feet against David's legs.  Those who have a significant other might recognize themselves in this amusing scene when Ann asks David if he would marry her, if they would do the whole thing over again.  David responds that he would not, as he wants to be honest with Ann.  Consequently, Ann removes her feet from David's warm legs.As the story unfolds, David and Ann find out that their marriage is invalid by human error.  This leads the film into an interesting journey with role reversal in regards to David's previous comment at the breakfast table.  Shrewdly, Hitchcock depicts his comic tale in the light of the current, 1940s that is, society's perceptive of a proper marriage and decent living.  The film also illustrates how unbalanced women's rights were at the time, as Ann tries to make a living by herself.  This is interesting, as Carole Lombard was very progressive and active for her own right, as she was aware of the male dominating film industry.  She even managed to get herself top salaries, which at the time paid her as much as $35,000 per week.  Consequently, Hitchcock's attempt to make a comedy received mixed opinions, but the film itself offers a solid cinematic experience with both humor and social concepts that should be pondered.",4,The Queen of Screwball Comedy in Fine Hitchcock Film...,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,4043,"['Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'film', 'compared', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'other', 'films', 'first', 'obvious', 'difference', 'audience', 'absence', 'murder', 'other', 'wicked', 'elements', 'Instead', 'Hitchcock', 'created', 'comedy', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'whom', 'held', 'high', 'esteem', 'Lombard', 'made', 'several', 'great', 'films', '1930s', 'My', 'Man', 'Godfrey', '1936', 'unfortunately', 'passed', 'away', 'plane', 'crash', 'age', '33', 'Nonetheless', 'left', 'world', 'number', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'leaving', 'legacy', 'being', 'queen', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'people', 'reminiscence.The', 'camera', 'hotel', 'room', 'several', 'dirty', 'plates', 'eaten', 'deserts', 'meals', 'beginning', 'film', 'slowly', 'panning', 'towards', 'rough', 'looking', 'David', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'who', 'playing', 'solitaire', 'obvious', 'David', 'silently', 'squander', 'time', 'waiting', 'wife', 'Ann', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'get', 'up', 'bed', 'David', 'studies', 'Ann', 'who', 'cocooned', 'blanket', 'pretending', 'sleep', 'Simultaneously', 'room', 'service', 'knocks', 'door', 'breakfast', 'Ann', 'out', 'blanket', 'when', 'David', 'breakfast', 'overtly', 'express', 'silent', 'contempt', 'unknown', 'reason', 'husband', 'other', 'hand', 'be', 'used', 'merely', 'up', 'breakfast', 'silently', 'away', 'order', 'let', 'calm', 'down.The', 'opening', 'set', 'up', 'displays', 'Hitchcock', 'ingenious', 'story', 'telling', 'technique', 'intrigue', 'clear', 'beginning', 'film', 'addition', 'framing', 'mise-en-scene', 'are', 'exceptional', 'film', 'enhance', 'messages', 'film', 'Several', 'different', 'notions', 'can', 'be', 'deduced', 'scene', 'such', 'are', 'married', 'tension', 'expect', 'one', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'communication', 'Ann', 'David', 'find', 'way', 'fix', 'quarrel', 'gone', 'three', 'days', 'took', 'ceremony', 'when', 'said', 'death', 'do', 'part', 'very', 'seriously', 'work', 'things', 'out.Shortly', 'opening', 'Hitchcock', 'interesting', 'scene', 'where', 'Ann', 'David', 'tremendous', 'trust', 'David', 'Ann', 'carefully', 'sharp', 'blade', 'Maybe', 'could', 'draw', 'suggestive', 'thoughts', 'shower', 'scene', 'Psycho', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'still', 'was', 'angry', 'However', 'comedy', 'will', 'not', 'happen', 'idea', 'still', 'mind', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'Instead', 'Ann', 'talks', 'faithfulness', 'honesty', 'other', 'decent', 'concepts', 'generate', 'healthy', 'marriage', 'following', 'scene', 'Ann', 'feet', 'David', 'legs', 'who', 'have', 'significant', 'other', 'might', 'recognize', 'amusing', 'scene', 'when', 'Ann', 'David', 'would', 'marry', 'would', 'do', 'whole', 'thing', 'over', 'again', 'David', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'honest', 'Ann', 'Consequently', 'Ann', 'feet', 'David', 'warm', 'legs.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'David', 'Ann', 'find', 'out', 'marriage', 'invalid', 'human', 'error', 'film', 'interesting', 'journey', 'role', 'reversal', 'regards', 'David', 'previous', 'comment', 'breakfast', 'table', 'Shrewdly', 'Hitchcock', 'comic', 'tale', 'light', 'current', '1940s', 'society', 'perceptive', 'proper', 'marriage', 'decent', 'living', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'unbalanced', 'women', 'rights', 'were', 'time', 'Ann', 'make', 'living', 'interesting', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'was', 'very', 'progressive', 'active', 'own', 'right', 'was', 'aware', 'male', 'dominating', 'film', 'industry', 'even', 'managed', 'get', 'top', 'salaries', 'time', 'paid', 'as', 'much', '35,000', 'week', 'Consequently', 'Hitchcock', 'attempt', 'make', 'comedy', 'received', 'mixed', 'opinions', 'film', 'solid', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'humor', 'social', 'concepts', 'should', 'be', 'pondered']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS
34950,A29R4FCO6RFX4K,0780626699,"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy""","[1, 2]","Equaled only by Scorsese and Spielberg, Alfred Hitchcock brought so many classic thrillers and chilling tales of murder and macabre to the screen, he will forever be remembered as the master of suspense. This impressive DVD collection contains some of Hitch's finest films that will last forever in Hollywood history. STRANGERS ON A TRAIN (1951) is one of my personal favorites, superbly acted by Farley Granger (Who had previously worked with Hitch on ROPE) as Guy Haynes and Robert Walker gives a nuanced, chilling performance as Guy's murder-switching partner Bruno Antony. This 'lesser' film of Hitch's canon is perhaps his greatest achievement. Sharply edited and featuring an amazing score by Hitchcock stalwart buddy Dimitri Tiomkin, SOAT contains all the right ingredients that make a classic thriller, building up to a fantastic climax. It should be noted that most directors today would give their right arm to make films of this caliber.NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) showed just how apt Alfred was with faced-paced action as well as suspense, Cary Grant gives his finest performance as Roger Thornhill. The classic scene with Grant being chased unmercifully by a plane in the desert is the highlight of the film. The razor-sharp editing from George Tomasini makes this an essential in the collection. DIAL M FOR MUDER (1954) is classic suspense, showcasing several fabulous Hollywood talents, especially Robert Cummings and Anthony Dawson. When one dotes on Hitchcock's overall work, FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT  (1940) isn't probably the first one mentioned. However, the film is just a fun work of a true legend. THE WRONG MAN (1956) has a fascinating take on human nature and the true meanings of people's uncdercurrent. And the superb STAGE FRIGHT (1950) is a fantastic example of the genre, boasting great scrpitwork, stunning cinematography and fast-paced action. Veteran actor Montgomery Clift carries the 1953 film I CONFESS, which, while it's not made as sharply as Hitch's other films, still displays burgeoning talent from the visionary director and cinematography from Robert Burks. Wrapping up the box set with MR. AND MRS.

In this Hitchcock comedy, Ann Smith (Carole Lombard) is the well-dressed romantic spoiled bride of wealthy lawyer, David Smith (Robert Montgomery -- father of famed BEWITCHED star Elizabeth Montgomery). Ann insists on David's honesty in their 3-year old marriage. Any arguments must be resolved before anyone is allowed to leave the bedroom.An unexpected visitor to David's office reveals that the marriage is not legal. Unbeknownst to David, the gentleman later visits Ann with the same news. Ann assumes David will top off a romantic evening with a legal marriage ceremony so she squeezes into her original wedding dress. It appears, however, that David is not in a hurry to exchange vows, though he is willing to change into something more comfortable after a Champagne nightcap. An infuriated Ann, then amplifies her ""singleness"" by evicting David, obtaining employment, and looking for a new mate. The battle is on, as David is intent to sabotage Ann's plans.This makes my tenth Lombard film viewing. As matriarch of the screwball comedy genre, she again demonstrates her talent to deliver smart lines and convey intense emotion. (She works those eyebrows!) The ending wasn't quite what one might expect and the largely Hitchcock British humor is more subtle than slapstick. Nevertheless, there are many funny situations and inuendos. Most of the vindictive actions are just plain crude and unreasonable, but make no mistake, MR. AND MRS. SMITH is enjoyable.Movie quote: ""I can't imagine anything hanging in the closet shrinking so much.""",4,Kiss and make up -- not all that easy (recommended),1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,1661,"['2005', 'version', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'undercover', 'spies', 'not', 'remake', 'unrelated', '1941', 'MR.', 'MRS.', 'SMITH', 'Hitchcock', 'comedy', 'Ann', 'Smith', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'well-dressed', 'romantic', 'spoiled', 'bride', 'wealthy', 'lawyer', 'David', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'father', 'famed', 'BEWITCHED', 'star', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'Ann', 'David', 'honesty', '3-year', 'old', 'marriage', 'arguments', 'must', 'be', 'resolved', 'anyone', 'allowed', 'leave', 'bedroom.An', 'unexpected', 'visitor', 'David', 'office', 'reveals', 'marriage', 'not', 'legal', 'Unbeknownst', 'David', 'gentleman', 'later', 'Ann', 'same', 'news', 'Ann', 'David', 'will', 'top', 'off', 'romantic', 'evening', 'legal', 'marriage', 'ceremony', 'original', 'wedding', 'dress', 'however', 'David', 'not', 'hurry', 'exchange', 'vows', 'willing', 'change', 'something', 'more', 'comfortable', 'Champagne', 'nightcap', 'infuriated', 'Ann', 'then', 'singleness', 'evicting', 'David', 'obtaining', 'employment', 'looking', 'new', 'mate', 'battle', 'David', 'intent', 'sabotage', 'Ann', 'plans.This', 'tenth', 'Lombard', 'film', 'viewing', 'matriarch', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'genre', 'again', 'talent', 'deliver', 'smart', 'lines', 'convey', 'intense', 'emotion', 'eyebrows', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'largely', 'Hitchcock', 'British', 'humor', 'more', 'subtle', 'slapstick', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'situations', 'inuendos', 'Most', 'vindictive', 'actions', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'crude', 'unreasonable', 'make', 'mistake', 'MR.', 'AND', 'MRS.', 'SMITH', 'enjoyable.Movie', 'quote', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anything', 'hanging', 'closet', 'shrinking', 'so', 'much']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS

34958,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,0780626699,Nix Pix,"[0, 0]","""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (1941) is the most uncharacteristic film in Hitchcock's canon and, indeed, this box set - a featherweight romantic comedy with shifting undercurrents; all about a feuding husband (David/Robert Montgomery) and wife (Ann/Carol Lombard) who, after living together for three years, suddenly discover that they're not legally married. When David hesitates in legitimizing their union Ann bolts for the nearest quick fix - a stoic romance with her business partner, Jeff Custer (Gene Raymond). In keeping with the formulaic conventions of classic screwball comedies, this one employs a series of hopelessly inept, though nevertheless hilarious, bits of complicated mischief in which David plots to win Ann back. In exploring his comedic side, Hitchcock hints at diversity in his greatness. There are moments in this film which make one pine for more such examples from the director that, sadly, never materialized.Warner's DVD transfer exhibits a balanced gray scale with deep, solid blacks and reasonably clean whites. Dirt, scratches and other age related artifacts are present but do not terribly distract. There's a complete lack of edge enhancement, pixelization and shimmering of fine details for a picture that is overall smooth and easy on the eyes. The audio is mono but very nicely cleaned up.",4,UNCHARACTERISTIC AND PLEASING COMEDY FROM MASTER OF SUSPENSE,1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,1316,"['Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', '1941', 'most', 'uncharacteristic', 'film', 'Hitchcock', 'canon', 'indeed', 'box', 'set', 'featherweight', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'shifting', 'undercurrents', 'feuding', 'husband', 'David/Robert', 'Montgomery', 'wife', 'Ann/Carol', 'Lombard', 'who', 'living', 'together', 'three', 'years', 'suddenly', ""'re"", 'not', 'legally', 'married', 'When', 'David', 'legitimizing', 'union', 'Ann', 'bolts', 'nearest', 'quick', 'fix', 'stoic', 'romance', 'business', 'partner', 'Jeff', 'Custer', 'Gene', 'Raymond', 'keeping', 'formulaic', 'conventions', 'classic', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'one', 'series', 'hopelessly', 'inept', 'nevertheless', 'hilarious', 'bits', 'complicated', 'mischief', 'David', 'plots', 'win', 'Ann', 'back', 'exploring', 'comedic', 'side', 'Hitchcock', 'hints', 'diversity', 'greatness', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'pine', 'more', 'such', 'examples', 'director', 'sadly', 'never', 'materialized.Warner', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'balanced', 'gray', 'scale', 'deep', 'solid', 'blacks', 'reasonably', 'clean', 'whites', 'Dirt', 'scratches', 'other', 'age', 'related', 'artifacts', 'are', 'present', 'do', 'not', 'terribly', 'distract', 'complete', 'lack', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'pixelization', 'shimmering', 'fine', 'details', 'picture', 'overall', 'smooth', 'easy', 'eyes', 'audio', 'mono', 'very', 'nicely', 'cleaned', 'up']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS

34960,AWVEW7Y1WFFPB,0780626699,Paul,"[2, 2]","Hitchcock was &quot;The Master of Suspense.&quot; His films were famous for combining action, big stars, Bernard Herrmann music, suspense, and even traces of wry and subtle humor. However, in his long career, Alfred Hitchcock only made two films that can be classified as total comedy. One was 1955s The Trouble With Harry, which was a black comedy, but still definitely a COMEDY. His only other comedy, he made 15 years prior to this, in 1940. He made the film as a favor to a friend of his. That friend was Carole Lombard, the undoubted Queen of Screwball Comedy. She had read the script and fallen in love with it, yet she couldn't find a director, so Alfred Hitchcock agreed to do it for her. The film was Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and it starred such comic legends as Carole Lombard, Robert Montgomery, Gene Raymond, and a young Jack Carson.Mr. and Mrs. Smith is the story of a bickering, but non-the-less happily married couple. In the films hilarious opening scene, the Smiths are locked in their bedroom. It seems that they have a set of rules they follow each time they get into a quarrel. They lock themselves in their room and do not come out until the fight is solved. One time, they stayed in the room for 8 days. When they finally solve the dispute, they sit down for breakfast, where they are as happy and as &quot;in love&quot; as ever, but rule number 7 permits Mrs. Smith to ask Mr. Smith a question, and she asks him, &quot;If you had to do it over again, would you have married me?&quot; He tells her how much he loves her and how happy he is, but he concludes by saying that married life is too much for him, and that if he had the chance, he wouldn't have married her. At first a little disappointed, Mr. Smith soon comes to see that her husband really does love her, and he goes to work happy, and she blissfully starts the chores.Unfortunately, a man comes to Mr. Smith's office and informs him that because of the fact of &quot;the town is across the river and is in one county and has been considered in another county, but the other county isn't in the state&quot; that Mr. David Smith and Mrs. Ann Smith aren't legally married. The laughter and humor keep rising after he is kicked out of the apartment and has to live in a local men&iexcl;s' club. Each gets a temporary partner and after a hilarious restaurant scene, a crowd of three is off for a weekend in the county in the uplifting conclusion of Hitchcock&iexcl;s classic Screwball Comedy.Marvelously scripted with beautiful and flawless performances by all the cast, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a breathtaking and fast paced classic. Although not typical Hitchcock, his traces are still evident. There are small incidents of suspense, a small chase scene in a department store, a stalled Parachute Jump in the rain at the World&iexcl;s Fair, and some great chemistry and rapport between the stars on the screen. If Carole had not died tragically a few years later, in 1942, I would not have been surprised if Lombard and Montgomery had made more films together. Looking at them here, how can one have doubt as to how successful they would have been?",5,"Not a Typical Hitchcock, but His Trademarks are Still There!",993772800,"06 29, 2001",2001,3122,"['Hitchcock', 'was', 'quot', 'Master', 'Suspense.', 'quot', 'films', 'were', 'famous', 'combining', 'action', 'big', 'stars', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'music', 'suspense', 'even', 'traces', 'wry', 'subtle', 'humor', 'However', 'long', 'career', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'only', 'made', 'two', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'classified', 'total', 'comedy', 'One', 'was', '1955s', 'Trouble', 'Harry', 'was', 'black', 'comedy', 'still', 'definitely', 'COMEDY', 'only', 'other', 'comedy', 'made', '15', 'years', 'prior', '1940', 'made', 'film', 'favor', 'friend', 'friend', 'was', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'undoubted', 'Queen', 'Screwball', 'Comedy', 'had', 'read', 'script', 'fallen', 'love', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'director', 'so', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'agreed', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'starred', 'such', 'comic', 'legends', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'Gene', 'Raymond', 'young', 'Jack', 'Carson.Mr', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'story', 'bickering', 'non-the-less', 'happily', 'married', 'couple', 'films', 'hilarious', 'opening', 'scene', 'Smiths', 'are', 'locked', 'bedroom', 'have', 'set', 'rules', 'follow', 'time', 'get', 'quarrel', 'lock', 'room', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'fight', 'solved', 'One', 'time', 'stayed', 'room', '8', 'days', 'When', 'finally', 'solve', 'dispute', 'sit', 'down', 'breakfast', 'where', 'are', 'happy', 'quot', 'love', 'quot', 'ever', 'number', '7', 'permits', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'ask', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'question', 'quot', 'had', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'married', 'quot', 'how', 'much', 'how', 'happy', 'saying', 'married', 'life', 'too', 'much', 'had', 'chance', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'married', 'first', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'soon', 'see', 'husband', 'really', 'love', 'work', 'happy', 'blissfully', 'chores.Unfortunately', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'office', 'fact', 'quot', 'town', 'river', 'one', 'county', 'been', 'considered', 'county', 'other', 'county', ""n't"", 'state', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'David', 'Smith', 'Mrs.', 'Ann', 'Smith', 'are', ""n't"", 'legally', 'married', 'laughter', 'humor', 'keep', 'rising', 'kicked', 'apartment', 'live', 'local', 'men', 'iexcl', 'club', 'temporary', 'partner', 'hilarious', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'crowd', 'three', 'weekend', 'county', 'uplifting', 'conclusion', 'Hitchcock', 'iexcl', 'classic', 'Screwball', 'Comedy.Marvelously', 'scripted', 'beautiful', 'flawless', 'performances', 'cast', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'breathtaking', 'fast', 'paced', 'classic', 'not', 'typical', 'Hitchcock', 'traces', 'are', 'still', 'evident', 'are', 'small', 'incidents', 'suspense', 'small', 'chase', 'scene', 'department', 'store', 'stalled', 'Parachute', 'Jump', 'rain', 'World', 'iexcl', 'Fair', 'great', 'chemistry', 'rapport', 'stars', 'screen', 'Carole', 'had', 'not', 'died', 'tragically', 'few', 'years', 'later', '1942', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'Lombard', 'Montgomery', 'had', 'made', 'more', 'films', 'together', 'Looking', 'here', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'have', 'doubt', 'how', 'successful', 'would', 'have', 'been']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS

The previously released Warner Home Video ""ALFRED HITCHCOCK SIGNATURE COLLECTION"" includes nine of his WB movies in a deluxe box set.  All the titles include special material.In 1953's I CONFESS, a brooding Montgomery Clift plays a devout priest who hears a killer's confession. Because priests hold in confidence things they hear in confession, his lips are sealed when the police investigate and soon he finds himself accused of the crime. The medieval sacrament of penance forbids him to speak out even in his own defense, and when his former love Anne Baxter and detective Karl Malden try to help, it only entraps him further. This dark, cynical film is a favorite of the French New Wave critics. I seem to recall that Hitchcock once saying: ""Everyone's guilty of something. Even priests.""FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT stars Joel McCrea as an intrepid American reporter who believes he's stumbled on the biggest story in pre-war Europe. Things get complicated and he has to enlist the help of beautiful Laraine Day to track down a group of spies.  This classic suspenser was nominated for six 1940 Academy Awards including Best Picture. Extra: ""Personal History: Foreign Hitchcock.""In STAGE FRIGHT Jane Wyman is a drama student who tries to clear her friend Richard Todd of being framed for murder by becoming the maid of stage diva Marlene Dietrich.  Todd's affair with Dietrich has made him the chief suspect in the death of her husband.  There's lots of dark humor from the terrific ensemble cast that includes Alastair Sim, Sybil Thorndyke and Hitch's daughter Patricia. Extra: ""Hitchcock and Stage Fright.""Originally shot in 3D, DIAL M FOR MURDER is the screen version of Frederick Knott's hit stage play.  Grace Kelly, Ray Milland and Robert Cummings star in a love triangle about a husband (Milland) plotting the murder of his unfaithful wife (Kelly). But a phone call to set up the kill gets the wrong answer from the right number.  Extras: ""Hitchcock and Dial M"" and ""3D: A Brief History.""A perfectly cast Henry Fonda is THE WRONG MAN.  A true story about musician Manny Balestrero accused and tried for crimes committed by a look-alike robber.  ""Guilt Trip: Hitchcock and the Wrong Man"" is a superior bonus featurette.SUSPICION got Joan Fontaine a 1941 Oscar for Best Actress for her outstanding performance as the paranoid bride.

She and screen husband Robert Montgomery have bickered for three years when they discover that a technicality voids their marriage.

Her chance, long awaited, came while she was filming this slight comedy..........As we all know, Hitchcock appeared in cameos in most all his movies (I don't know if he did this in his earliest films).  Carole Lombard went to the director's chair for this brief flash!  Lombard chose the camera angle professionaly, gave instructions to both Hitch and Bob Montgomery and shot the scene twice.  Like all good directors, she began at the end and worked back to it again; unlike some, she did her own film cutting afterwards..............This was Alfred Hitchcock's first American comedy.  Surprisingly, it has no suspence and even less plot!  A bouncing little film about a New York couple who are, as Hitch once said ""are as typical as maize on the cob"".  Here we see the giddier members of any U.S. community, and, entrusted to such actors as Lombard and Montgomery,  its a diverting if not an altogether satisfying venture into a 1940 comedy.  The Smiths are decididly decent people who quarrel, are sorry, make up, quarrel again.  Then a little man visits each of them separately with the news that, owing to a surveying error, the town they were married in wasn't legally incorporated and hence they aren't legally married.  What happens after that follows a Hollywood rather than a Smith pattern.  But in the hands of so a resourceful a director as Hitchcock and so gifted a comedienne as Lombard, the Smiths make entertaining company for 95 minutes.",4,A HITCHCOCK SCREWBALL COMEDY!,1005264000,"11 9, 2001",2001,1833,"['note', 'trivia', 'fanatics', 'fourteen', 'years', 'movies', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'had', 'tried', 'hand', 'practically', 'phase', 'film', 'production', 'had', 'been', 'serious', 'actress', 'superb', 'Screwball', 'comedienne', 're-writer', 'screen', 'scripts', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'advisor', 'technical', 'problems', 'even', 'critic', 'musical', 'scores', 'was', 'first', 'crack', 'directing', 'chance', 'long', 'awaited', 'came', 'was', 'filming', 'slight', 'comedy', 'know', 'Hitchcock', 'appeared', 'cameos', 'most', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', 'earliest', 'films', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'went', 'director', 'chair', 'brief', 'flash', 'Lombard', 'chose', 'camera', 'angle', 'professionaly', 'gave', 'instructions', 'Hitch', 'Bob', 'Montgomery', 'shot', 'scene', 'twice', 'good', 'directors', 'began', 'end', 'worked', 'back', 'again', 'did', 'own', 'film', 'cutting', 'afterwards', '..This', 'was', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'first', 'American', 'comedy', 'Surprisingly', 'suspence', 'even', 'less', 'plot', 'bouncing', 'little', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'Hitch', 'once', 'said', 'are', 'as', 'typical', 'maize', 'cob', 'Here', 'see', 'giddier', 'members', 'U.S.', 'community', 'entrusted', 'such', 'actors', 'Lombard', 'Montgomery', 'diverting', 'not', 'altogether', 'satisfying', 'venture', '1940', 'comedy', 'Smiths', 'are', 'decididly', 'decent', 'people', 'who', 'quarrel', 'are', 'sorry', 'make', 'up', 'quarrel', 'again', 'Then', 'little', 'man', 'separately', 'news', 'owing', 'surveying', 'error', 'town', 'were', 'married', 'was', ""n't"", 'legally', 'incorporated', 'hence', 'are', ""n't"", 'legally', 'married', 'What', 'Hollywood', 'rather', 'Smith', 'pattern', 'hands', 'resourceful', 'director', 'Hitchcock', 'so', 'gifted', 'comedienne', 'Lombard', 'Smiths', 'make', 'entertaining', 'company', '95', 'minutes']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS
34970,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,0780626699,Simon Davis,"[8, 9]","Long dubbed ""The Master of Suspense"", it is a surprise to learn that Alfred Hitchcock is responsible for the directing efforts in this light comic effort from 1941 which he made very soon after possibly one of his greatest suspense dramas in the classic ""Rebecca"",in 1940. At first glance you may think that Alfred Hitchcock directing Hollywood's screwball comedy Queen Carole Lombard might not work however the two meshed well together here in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", and produced a funny if not hilarious comedy. It certainly showcased the beautiful Mrs Clark Gable at the peak of her beauty and matured talents just prior to her tragic death in a plane crash while on a war bond selling tour . In her second last film Lombard combined for the only time with MGM leading man Robert Montgomery and the pair  make a pleasing team here in this tale of a marriage that turns out not to be legal and where both parties get a unique chance to test the loyalty and commitment of their ""former"" spouses. While not the crazy type of comedy one comes to expect from Carole Lombard it is an enjoyable farce and the second half in particular when it picks up speed contains many enjoyable comic highjinks that are sure to raise a laugh.Based on a story by Norman Krasna ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", concerns the story of David and Ann Smith (Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard), a affluent couple who have an agreement that they will never part from each other in the middle of a disagreement. The beginning sees the Smiths holed up in their bedroom for three days until the dispute is resolved much to the annoyance of the staff who have to pass meals and mail etc through a crack in the door. Reconciliation of course follows and when at the breakfast table Ann innocently asks David if he had his time over again whether he would marry her he unthinkingly replies that no he wouldn't. Later that day David is visited by a gentleman who informs him that because of a legal technicality based on the boundaries of two of the states, he is not legally married. Unbeknown to David this man knows Ann's family from where they were married and he later visits the apartment and informs Ann and her mother Mrs. Krausheimer (Esther Dale), of the turn of events concerning their marriage. Trying to remain calm Ann hopes David will suggest a second marriage right away until she remembers his words at breakfast. She decides to test him and plans a romantic evening where she hopes David will propose to her. The evening however does not go well and David fails to even raise the issue making Ann feel that David does mean that he would never marry her again. Locking him out of the apartment Ann resumes her maiden name and takes up a job as a Sales Clerk. Suddenly single Ann begins to see David's business partner in the law firm Jeff Custer (Gene Raymond), much to David's annoyance and the former husband and wife begin a long game of one upmanship designed to get the other jealous. Jeff is reliable but very dull and secretly Ann misses David just as David misses Ann after a terrible night out with two very unpolished women at a night club. Following Jeff and Ann up to a mountain resort the fire works really begin as David attempts to break the pair up. Ann works out what his plan is after he tries to paint Ann as a loose woman in front of Jeff's conservative Southern parents (Philip Merivale and Lucile Watson), and she decides to play him at his own game however the pair eventually do realise that they are meant for each other and both really do want to become ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", again. The couple then make up and enjoy an embrace in between a pair of snow skis.It is said that Alfred Hitchcock agreed to direct ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", as a favour to Carole Lombard, an actress he greatly admired. Whether that is correct or not Hitchcock in his rare foray into the comedy genre proves to have a nice light touch in his staging of the marital mishaps of the Smith's in this story. There is an amusing story that Carole Lombard in her usual wacky style learnt that Hitchcock supposedly ""treated his casts like cattle"", so early one morning as a prank she actually set up a farm yard on the set complete with cows wearing nameplates for Hitchcock, Robert Montgomery and herself! Having just completed three fine dramas in a row for RKO with ""In Name Only"", ""Vigil in the Night"", and ""They Knew What They Wanted"", this effort was a much welcome return to the comic genre that Lombard was so renowned for. In her portrayal of the suddenly single ""Miss Krausheimer"", after three years of a non legal marriage Lombard displays her finely tuned comic abilities in a pleasing manner. She makes a great foil for Robert Montgomery who is actually very amusing in his role as the husband David who finds himself without his wife and having to face the fact that she seemingly doesn't seem to want him back after he foolishly said he wouldn't marry again if he had his time over. Gene Raymond as Jeff Custer the stuffy friend and business partner of David who pursues the suddenly single Ann also displays just the right bland sort of delivery and he is especially good in his drunk scene where he is offered some strong spirits by Ann after they are caught in the rain while on the parachute ride at the fun park. The second half of the story does pick up the screwball element and the best comic interludes include the very funny scene where David attempts to discredit Ann in front of Jeff's parents making her out as a ""loose woman"", which is very memorable as are the attempts by Ann in the chalet to make David jealous of Jeff by screaming out and dropping books on the floor which can be heard clearly through the fine walls into David's room in the hope David will come to her rescue. In this final stage of her highly successful career Carole Lombard could ask for and get the best in all facets of a production and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"",was no exception. Not only does this film boast a first class director like Alfred Hitchcock, but also outstanding photography by Harry Stradling that makes Carole Lombard look probably her most glamourous on screen ever. The art direction by Van Nest Polglase is also top rate in particular for the Smith's apartment and the scenes at the ski lodge. Famed Hollywood designer Irene also goes all out in the glamour stakes here and provides Carole Lombard with some of her most beautiful clothes ever on screen. If ever the image of Lombard as one of Hollywood's best dressed women started with one film it would certainly be because of her outfits in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"".For an enjoyable if not terribly memorable comic outing ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", makes an enjoyable way to pass the time. This type of marital comedy based on misunderstandings almost entirely disappeared once the Second World War really got underway with America's involvement. Indeed the film has a very 1930's feel to it which does add to its charm with the passage of time. I appreciate ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", first and foremost for the comic playing on a much less frantic level than in previous efforts to be sure, by the legendary Carole Lombard. It is almost haunting to see her here so beautiful and full of life knowing that she would be dead within a year and a half. Enjoy the marital mishaps of the ""Smiths"", when a marriage which was ""forever"", becomes a battle royale between two parties out to test the loyalty of each other in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"".",4,Carole Lombard In Alfred Hitchcock's Rare Marital Comedy,1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,7483,"['Long', 'dubbed', 'Master', 'Suspense', 'surprise', 'learn', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock',

34972,A2F7XTL4KHDZME,0780626699,Stephen Reginald,"[39, 42]","Alfred Hitchcock directed Mr. and Mrs. Smith as a favor to Carole Lombard (he was renting her home after she married Clark Gable) in this  sophisticated comedy.  Ann (Lombard) and David Smith (Robert Montgomery)  star as a wealthy Manhattan couple who engage in some prolonged marital  squabbles because they have agreed to keep themselves locked up in their  bedroom until the matters are resolved.  Some battles have kept them holed  up for over a week at a time.  After making up from one of these fights,  Ann asks David if given the chance to go back in time would he marry her  again.  He answers that he wouldn't even though he loves her very much.  David thinks that married life is too complicated.  Before you know it, a  man enters David's law office to inform him that due to a technicality, he  and Ann are not married.  David wants to keep this news a secret from Ann  for a while, but she finds out anyway.  Ann thinks that David is planning  to propose all over again, waiting for the perfect romantic moment, but he  doesn't.  This causes Ann to kick David out of their beautiful New York  City apartment declaring that she's not sure she loves him anymore.  When  Ann starts dating, David begins in earnest to win her back.  But not after  he spends some hilarious days at his club where he meets an old business  associate, played by Jack Carson, who encourages David to go out on a  double date with him.  Montgomery's scenes at the supper club are pure  comic genius.  In these scenes alone, he proves his status as one of the  greatest comic performers in film.  All hell breaks lose when Ann starts  dating David's partner, played by Gene Raymond.  When David finds out that  his partner and old college buddy is squiring his wife, he redoubles his  efforts at getting Ann back.  This is probably one of the oddest films in  the Hitchcock canon because it is completely lacking in what we have come  to expect from his movies.  There is no violence, no real suspense, no  mystery, no crazy mothers ruining their sons' lives, and so on.  But taken  on its own merits, it is a completely enjoyable film, which reminds us what  wonderful comic talents Lombard and Montgomery were and how the likes of  which we are unlikely to see again.  With witty dialogue, great pacing and  acting, including terrific character bits by Carson and Lucile Watson as  Lombard's mother.  Produced in 1940 and released in 1941, this film has  some footage of New York during the time of the 1939 World's Fair.  In fact  Lombard and Raymond go to the Fair after a dinner date.  This really isn't  minor Hitchcock, but it isn't what you've come to expect from the master of  suspense.  Perhaps he was trying to prove (early on too) that he was also  the master of any film project he decided to take on.  If you love the  screwball comedies of the 1930s and early 1940s, give this one a look.",4,An Overlooked Gem,966902400,"08 22, 2000",2000,2892,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'directed', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'favor', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'was', 'renting', 'home', 'married', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'Ann', 'Lombard', 'David', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'star', 'wealthy', 'Manhattan', 'couple', 'who', 'engage', 'prolonged', 'marital', 'squabbles', 'have', 'agreed', 'keep', 'locked', 'up', 'bedroom', 'matters', 'are', 'resolved', 'battles', 'have', 'kept', 'holed', 'up', 'week', 'time', 'making', 'up', 'one', 'fights', 'Ann', 'David', 'given', 'chance', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'would', 'marry', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'very', 'much', 'David', 'married', 'life', 'too', 'complicated', 'know', 'man', 'David', 'law', 'office', 'inform', 'due', 'technicality', 'Ann', 'are', 'not', 'married', 'David', 'keep', 'news', 'secret', 'Ann', 'while', 'out', 'anyway', 'Ann', 'David', 'planning', 'propose', 'over', 'again', 'waiting', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'moment', ""n't"", 'Ann', 'kick', 'David', 'beautiful', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'apartment', 'declaring', 'not', 'sure', 'anymore', 'When', 'Ann', 'dating', 'David', 'earnest', 'win', 'back', 'not', 'hilarious', 'days', 'club', 'where', 'old', 'business', 'associate', 'played', 'Jack', 'Carson', 'who', 'David', 'go', 'out', 'double', 'date', 'Montgomery', 'scenes', 'supper', 'club', 'are', 'pure', 'comic', 'genius', 'scenes', 'alone', 'status', 'one', 'greatest', 'comic', 'performers', 'film', 'hell', 'breaks', 'lose', 'when', 'Ann', 'dating', 'David', 'partner', 'played', 'Gene', 'Raymond', 'When', 'David', 'out', 'partner', 'old', 'college', 'buddy', 'squiring', 'wife', 'efforts', 'getting', 'Ann', 'back', 'probably', 'one', 'oddest', 'films', 'Hitchcock', 'canon', 'completely', 'lacking', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'movies', 'violence', 'real', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'crazy', 'mothers', 'ruining', 'sons', 'lives', 'so', 'taken', 'own', 'merits', 'completely', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'what', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'talents', 'Lombard', 'Montgomery', 'were', 'how', 'likes', 'are', 'unlikely', 'see', 'again', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'great', 'pacing', 'acting', 'including', 'terrific', 'character', 'bits', 'Carson', 'Lucile', 'Watson', 'Lombard', 'mother', 'Produced', '1940', 'released', '1941', 'film', 'footage', 'New', 'York', 'time', '1939', 'World', 'Fair', 'fact', 'Lombard', 'Raymond', 'go', 'Fair', 'dinner', 'date', 'really', ""n't"", 'minor', 'Hitchcock', ""n't"", 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'master', 'suspense', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'trying', 'prove', 'early', 'too', 'was', 'also', 'master', 'film', 'project', 'decided', 'take', 'love', 'screwball', 'comedies', '1930s', 'early', '1940s', 'give', 'one', 'look']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS
34973,A1XMXJSZPEXQXU,0780626699,The Conscience of Zeno,"[2, 9]","This is a strange one. An Alfred Hitchcock movie that is absolutely anonymous. In fact, Hitchcock made a couple of forays outside the thriller genre and both were very poor. ""Under Capricorn"" is a kitchen sink, tear-jerker and ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" is, ostensibly, a screwball comedy. The problem is Hitchcock doesn't understand the screwball format and the pace is slow and the jokes unfunny. Montgomery is badly miscast as the obnoxious husband, and his asides and grimaces make it seem like he has a bad case of constipation. Lombard is, as always, good, but she can't do much with this material. Did I mention that the screenplay is also extremely poor? The thing just doesn't hold together.

But this collection looks great. Some Hitch CLASSICS. STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, DIAL M FOR MURDER (Which has been unavailable on DVD), NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and one of my all time favorites, THE WRONG MAN. if you're just starting a Hitchcock collection, you can't go wrong with this set.I just hope two of these are being sold separately. I need DIAL M and THE WRONG MAN.If you've never seen STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, you don't know what you're missing. Robert Walker's Bruno is quite possibly the most delicious villain ever to double-cross a Hitchcock protagonist. A dark comedic performance that will make you howl with delight. SEE IT. I can't say if it includes both the American and British versions which are included on the Warner Brothers single DVD that I own. This package doesn't come out until tomorrow.

34975,A196IMI8WKWDFK,0780626699,"Vannie Ryanes ""Vannie Ryanes/VSR Book Review""","[1, 1]","Robert Montgomery and beautiful and talented Carole Lombard star in the only comedy Alfred Hitchcock ever made.Mr. (David) and Mrs. (Ann) Smith are a well off couple who find that, through some mishap they are not legally married. When David is given this information, does he tell his wife? No way. Instead he chooses to toy with her first. Later, Ann and David talk on the telephone, she asks about his day, he does not mention their invalid marriage but he does tell her that they are going to what used to be their favorite restaurant. As David is talking, he writes ""Mrs."", crosses it off and replaces it with ""Mistress"" then smiles. Unbeknownst to David, Ann and her mother have received the same information that he has. Ann's mother worries makes her daughter promise that, now, as an unmarried woman she won't ---?!. 'Of course not' Ann says.  Ann waits for her husband David to tell her what she already knows and is furious when he says nothing. This unshared information starts a wonderful, sexy cat and mouse game between Lombard and Montgomery. The getting ready for bed scene is just hilarious. Gene Raymond as Jeff Custer, David's best friend and law partner is full of southern charm and is wonderfully sly as he double crosses David at every turn. Jack Carson as the hard drinking womanizing, club friend Chuck, who helps to land David in hotter water than he is already in, is perfect for this role. One of my favorite scenes are the hilarious restaurant scene where David Montgomery and Chuck are on dates with two of Chuck's lady friends. By coincidence, Ann is dining at the same restaurant. Watch David's face as he pretends that he is with the beautiful woman sitting opposite his real date, and as he desperately tries to make his nose bleed. When arrangements are made for Ann and David's friend Jeff to spend some time together, David follows them to make trouble and get his wife back. It's our loss that they don't make sophisticated screwball comedies like this any more.",4,Hitchcock Does Comedy!,1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,2001,"['Robert', 'Montgomery', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'star', 'only', 'comedy', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'ever', 'made.Mr', 'David', 'Mrs.', 'Ann', 'Smith', 'are', 'well', 'couple', 'who', 'find', 'mishap', 'are', 'not', 'legally', 'married', 'When', 'David', 'given', 'information', 'tell', 'wife', 'way', 'Instead', 'toy', 'first', 'Later', 'Ann', 'David', 'talk', 'telephone', 'day', 'not', 'mention', 'invalid', 'marriage', 'tell', 'are', 'going', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'favorite', 'restaurant', 'David', 'talking', 'Mrs.', 'off', 'replaces', 'Mistress', 'then', 'Unbeknownst', 'David', 'Ann', 'mother', 'have', 'received', 'same', 'information', 'Ann', 'mother', 'worries', 'daughter', 'promise', 'now', 'unmarried', 'woman', 'wo', ""n't"", 'course', 'not', 'Ann', 'Ann', 'husband', 'David', 'tell', 'what', 'already', 'furious', 'when', 'nothing', 'unshared', 'information', 'wonderful', 'sexy', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Lombard', 'Montgomery', 'getting', 'ready', 'bed', 'scene', 'just', 'hilarious', 'Gene', 'Raymond', 'Jeff', 'Custer', 'David', 'best', 'friend', 'law', 'partner', 'full', 'southern', 'charm', 'wonderfully', 'sly', 'double', 'David', 'turn', 'Jack', 'Carson', 'hard', 'drinking', 'womanizing', 'club', 'friend', 'Chuck', 'who', 'land', 'David', 'hotter', 'water', 'already', 'perfect', 'role', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'where', 'David', 'Montgomery', 'Chuck', 'are', 'dates', 'two', 'Chuck', 'lady', 'friends', 'coincidence', 'Ann', 'dining', 'same', 'restaurant', 'Watch', 'David', 'face', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'sitting', 'real', 'date', 'desperately', 'make', 'nose', 'bleed', 'When', 'arrangements', 'are', 'made', 'Ann', 'David', 'friend', 'Jeff', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'David', 'make', 'trouble', 'get', 'wife', 'back', 'loss', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sophisticated', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'more']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS
34976,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0780626699,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[176, 179]","It's rare that an artist can be both popular and one of the best at what he or she does. Alfred Hitchcock embodied both these elements. His films used suspenseful thrillers as a vehicle to try out inventive and often groundbreaking editing and camera techniques. While this collection from Warner Brothers doesn't include all his best films, there are enough here to justify picking up this generous and beautifully remastered collection of some of Hitch's best films.""Suspicion"" is the oldest of the nine films included in this boxed set. Cary Grant plays Johnny Aysgarth a womanizing gambler who flirts with the bookish Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine in her Oscar winning role). After he woos and marries her, Lina begins to suspect that Johnny may be trying to kill her for her money. Although RKO forced Hitchcock to change the ending from the one he wanted (I'll let you watch the short documentary on the film that's included to find out what occurred) and the film was seriously compromised by studio interference, it's still a worthwhile thriller that has Grant playing a cad at a point in his career when he was put into romantic leads. I'd be suspicious of anyone who said he loved me and still called me ""monkey face"".""Foreign Correspondent"" was made by Hitchcock while he was on loan from David O. Selznick's studio. Hitchcock relished the opportunity to work elsewhere as Selznick interfered too much with the making of the films he produced. Shot just as World War II was erupting in Europe dragging in other countries into the fray, the film stars Joel McCrea as reporter Johnny Jones (what's with all these Johnny's in Hitch's films?) discovers a conspiracy of fascists threatening to take over Europe. McCrea gives a energetic performance and, although he wasn't Hitch's first choice (Henry Fonda was his first choice but the production couldn't afford him), he more than lives up to the potential of the role.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" features Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery in a screw-ball (!) comedy directed by the master of suspense. Hitch directed the film as a favor to Carole Lombard a very good friend at the time.  While the script has some clever moments and Hitch's direction has a number of nice set pieces, it's one of Hitchcock's lesser works. It's still worth viewing.""Strangers on a Train"" is a flawed masterpiece from Hitch. Guy (Farley Granger) frustrated because his unfaithful wife won't give him a divorce so he can remarry, chats with Bruno (the marvelous Robert Walker in one of his best roles) a passenger he meets on the train back to Washington D.C.  After a drink Guy spills the beans about his wife and Bruno offers to swap murders. In essence, their crime will be perfect because their complete strangers and have no other connection other than the meeting on the train. Guy believes Bruno is joking and plays along. When Guy's wife is brutally murdered (in a stunning sequence where we see the murder reflected in the woman's glasses), Bruno expects Guy to reciprocate. Otherwise, he threatens to pin the murder on Guy. The stunning conclusion on the merry-go-round ranks as one of Hitch's best. This edition includes both the final theatrical version and ""preview"" versions of the film which differ slightly.""Dial M for Murder"" caught Hitchcock recharging his batteries. Whenever he felt the need to creatively regenerate, he'd pick a subject that would interest him technically but that was already put together. It's ironic, though, that he should pick another main character who is a tennis player. ""Dial M"" plays as a inverted version of ""Strangers"". Based on Frederick Knott's Broadway hit play, ""Dial M for Murder"" was originally shot in 3-D (and it's a wonderful film to see in that format if for no other reason than to see what a great film director can do with the format with subtly and style) but only exhibited in that format in certain venues. Ray Milland (subbing for Cary Grant who had an argument with Hitchcock and withdrew from the film) plays a slick tennis player who devises the perfect murder. He blackmails an old college chum (the impressive Anthony Dawson) to fake a break in and murder his wealthy wife (Grace Kelly). It seems that Milland has discovered that she had an affair with an American mystery writer (Bob Cummings). The inspector (the droll John Williams) in the case recognizes that appearances can be deceiving when he investigates a murder.Hitch believed ""Stage Fright"" to be one of his miscalculations because of a technical narrative trick he used to clue in viewers on the story. Richard Todd plays an actor being pursued for the murder of a lover's (Marlene Dietrich) husband.  Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) believes her male friend is innocent and goes undercover to try and catch the real killer. It's a marvelous and underrated Hitchcock minor classic with a brilliant opening sequence and conclusion. The actors all give exceptional performances particularly Todd and Wyman. Playing with the artifice of the theater world, Hitch also plays with audience expectations.""I Confess"" had a troubled history during its production. Breen's censorship office (which used to censor films even at the scripting stage) objected to Hitch's story of a Priest (Montgomery Clift) who hears a murder confession and is torn about reporting it to the police. His vow prevents him from doing so but it also implicates him in the murder. Also featuring Anne Baxter and Karl Malden, ""I Confess"" isn't entirely successful but its daring theme, performances and two stunning set pieces make it a worthwhile movie.With ""The Wrong Man"" Hitch finally got his wish to work with all American icon Henry Fonda. Hitch elected to try the approach used by the Italian Neo-realism movement (best represented by DeSica's ""The Bicycle Thief"") in telling the true story of a musician named Manny who is identified as a robbery and murder suspect. This case of mistaken identity, the opposite of Hitch's later experiment with ""Psycho"", took an unusual tact with a more realistic performance style and less stylized look. It's a minor Hitchcock classic with a strong performance by Vera Miles as Manny's wife who ends up having a nervous break down due to what occurs.All the movies look exceptional. The older movies have some analog inherent analog flaws due to the age of the films but, on the whole, have never looked better. ""Strangers on a Train"" has been digitally remastered for this edition and features a sharper image with less grain problems. The blacks, grays and whites are solid and less murky looking than on the previous edition. ""Dial M for Murder"" suffers from haloing due to the 3-D process used to shoot the movie but the colors are vibrant and rich. ""North by Northwest"" looks terrific. It was previously released on DVD and this is the same transfer using a cleaned up restored version of the film. The restored mono sound on ""Dial M"" and the many other films included here sounds crisp with good presence.Making up for some of their oversights in the past, Warner has spent a lot of money to spiff up these classic movies. Every single movie has a short documentary on the making of the film featuring directors Richard Franklin (""Psycho 2"", ""Roadgames"", ""Flatland"") and Peter Bogdanovich (""Paper Moon"", ""The Last Picture Show"", ""What's Up Doc?"") commenting on Hitch's films. Franklin's a good choice as he's demonstrated tremendous skill in his overlooked suspense films. Bogdanovich who enjoyed a friendship with Hitch and interviewed the master for his book on Hitchcock has tremendous insight. He also does a killer Hitchcock imitation. Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell a fine character actress who appeared in two of the nine films included here, provides an insider's perspective on the great director's work and his overlooked collaborator his wife Alma Reville Hitchcock. There's also a generous amount of behind-the-scenes photos included in many of the documentaries and clips from various films included in the set.Both ""North by Northwest"" and ""Strangers on a Train"" come with commentary tracks. ""North by Northwest"" features the same commentary track by the late great Ernest Lehman as the previous edition. ""Strangers on a Train"" combines comments from Bogdanovich, ""Psycho"" screenwriter Jospeh Stefano and clips from Patricia Highsmith who wrote the novel the film is based on. It's a pity that more clips of Hitch from Bogdanovich's interviews and others over the years weren't assembled to give us a running commentary from the master himself but both Bogdanovich and Stefano give great insight as they knew the man and/or worked with him and also have the distance of collaborators.A great set from Warner Brothers, ""The Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection"" should be an essential purchase for any fan of Hitch's. There's only one glaring omission from this set and that's ""Lifeboat"" which Hitchcock directed for Fox. Unfortunately, Warner wasn't able to secure the rights to include that for this DVD set. Oh, and I forgot to mention that every single title here is in the plastic Amray cases that Warner has recently begun releasing movies in so they're more durable than the cardboard sleeves for the previous editions of ""North by Northwest"" and ""Strangers on a Train"". My only complaint is with the box itself; it isn't all that sturdy and could have more details about the films and the extras. I'd also like to have seen an additional disc featuring maybe Hitchcock's films he made for the War Office during WWII as an extras here (similar to the episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" that Universal packaged with their boxed sets). Still, one can't argue with the price as it works out to be roughly $10.00 for each movie. You'd pay nearly double that to buy them separately.",5,Great collection of classics and minor gems from the master,1094774400,"09 10, 2004",2004,9776,"['rare', 'artist', 'can', 'be', 'popular',

Hitchcock's version is basically silly and not especially funny (he may have been a master of suspense, but not comedy), and headlines a slightly chubby Carol Lombard (Hitchcock's landlord who urged him to make the film--apparently against his better judgment).  Robert Montgomery (not the Director's first choice) is the less-than-better half who seems  over his acting head most of the time (especially compared to screwball-comedy veteran Lombard's performance).Outdoor soundstage sets look just plain phony while indoor sets look just plain cheap (and phony).  Very distracting.  Without Lombard, the film would have gone straight to DV...err, the drive-ins.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D.",2,Screwball Director's Choice,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,817,"['original', 'M', 'M', 'Smith', '1941', 'own', 'way', 'just', 'as', 'whacky', 'recent', 'Pitt/Jolie', 'vehicle', 'similarities', 'end', 'there', 'Hitchcock', 'version', 'basically', 'silly', 'not', 'especially', 'funny', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'master', 'suspense', 'not', 'comedy', 'slightly', 'chubby', 'Carol', 'Lombard', 'Hitchcock', 'landlord', 'who', 'urged', 'make', 'film', 'apparently', 'better', 'judgment', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'not', 'Director', 'first', 'choice', 'less-than-better', 'half', 'who', 'acting', 'head', 'most', 'time', 'especially', 'compared', 'screwball-comedy', 'veteran', 'Lombard', 'performance', '.Outdoor', 'soundstage', 'sets', 'look', 'just', 'plain', 'phony', 'indoor', 'sets', 'look', 'just', 'plain', 'cheap', 'phony', 'Very', 'distracting', 'Lombard', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'straight', 'DV', 'err', 'drive-ins.WILLIAM', 'FLANIGAN', 'Ph.D']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS
34978,AP3B615GM191G,0780626699,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 3]","In today's cinematic climate, romantic comedies premiere at the theaters seemingly every weekend.  The start of the genre may very well have been with Alfred Hitchcock's ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", a fun little comedy that shows Hitchcock indeed has a sense of humor.For a basic plot summary, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" sees ""married"" couple Ann (Carole Lombard) & David (Robert Montgomery) discover that, due to a technicality, they are not not officially betrothed.  What follows is a series of ""jilted lover"" events that would fit in nicely with any current rom-com.Though some may call me crazy for saying this, ""Smith"" is far better than Hitch's later-years Cold War snoozefests.  Though this movie is not deep intellectually, it is just a fun little romp and a treatise on married relationships.  That, to me, was the real highlight of the experience...watching Hitch's deft commentary on the institution of marriage weaved into the fabric of the movie.Also, the soundtrack is so light and catchy that it will be in your head for the next few days.  It really adds to the overall ""light"" feel of the picture.Overall, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is a fun little romp through romantic foibles.  Instead of trying to force suspense, Hitchcock instead goes light-hearted and provides an enjoyable experience.  Far better than the farcical ""The Trouble With Harry"".  The humor isn't forced in this one.",3,Hitchcock Goes Domestic,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,1378,"['today', 'cinematic', 'climate', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'premiere', 'theaters', 'seemingly', 'weekend', 'start', 'genre', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'fun', 'little', 'comedy', 'Hitchcock', 'indeed', 'sense', 'humor.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'married', 'couple', 'Ann', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'David', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'discover', 'due', 'technicality', 'are', 'not', 'not', 'officially', 'betrothed', 'What', 'series', 'jilted', 'lover', 'events', 'would', 'fit', 'nicely', 'current', 'rom-com.Though', 'may', 'call', 'crazy', 'saying', 'Smith', 'far', 'better', 'Hitch', 'later-years', 'Cold', 'War', 'snoozefests', 'movie', 'not', 'deep', 'intellectually', 'just', 'fun', 'little', 'romp', 'treatise', 'married', 'relationships', 'was', 'real', 'highlight', 'experience', 'watching', 'Hitch', 'deft', 'commentary', 'institution', 'marriage', 'weaved', 'fabric', 'movie.Also', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'light', 'catchy', 'will', 'be', 'head', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'really', 'overall', 'light', 'feel', 'picture.Overall', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'fun', 'little', 'romp', 'romantic', 'foibles', 'Instead', 'trying', 'force', 'suspense', 'Hitchcock', 'instead', 'light-hearted', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'Far', 'better', 'farcical', 'Trouble', 'Harry', 'humor', ""n't"", 'forced', 'one']",Mr & Mrs Smith VHS
