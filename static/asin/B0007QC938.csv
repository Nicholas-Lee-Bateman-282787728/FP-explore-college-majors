I always feel better after doing the back and shoulder exercises.  The movements are gentle, and effective.  No special equipment is required for the segments  I've tried (shoulders and back) - a big plus! - I just need me, the floor, and (sometimes) a straight-back chair.  I don't think that any special equipment is required for any of the workouts on this dvd.  JB Berns does a great job at being the instructor/motivator.  He gives understandable exercise directions and explanations, mingled with encouragement and brief anecdotes about the exercises.I am very glad I purchased this dvd, and I recommend it.",5,Effective and Well Done,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,698,"['excellent', 'dvd', 'wake', 'up', 'back', 'and/or', 'shoulder', 'pain', 'almost', 'daily', 'always', 'feel', 'better', 'doing', 'back', 'shoulder', 'exercises', 'movements', 'are', 'gentle', 'effective', 'special', 'equipment', 'required', 'segments', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'shoulders', 'back', 'big', 'plus', 'just', 'need', 'floor', 'sometimes', 'straight-back', 'chair', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'special', 'equipment', 'required', 'workouts', 'dvd', 'JB', 'Berns', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'instructor/motivator', 'understandable', 'exercise', 'directions', 'explanations', 'mingled', 'encouragement', 'brief', 'anecdotes', 'exercises.I', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'purchased', 'dvd', 'recommend']",Rehab Your Body at Home: 7 Hours of Rehabilitative Workouts
887294,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0007QC938,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[55, 56]","This DVD by instructor JB Burns is also known as JB Burns' Freedom Restoration Series.  It contains a series of rehabilitative workouts addressing seven different areas of the body.  For each area, there is a ""Series A,"" which is more beginning-level and a bit less intense, and ""Series B,"" which includes more intermediate exercises and more active stretches, for at total of 14 workouts on the DVD.  Most of the workouts are about 15 minutes long, although some are as short as 11 minutes, and a few are as long as 23 minutes.  All of the workouts feature Burns with two female background exercises (the women are different in each segment), and the only props that are needed are a chair and a mat for the floorwork.  I have broken down each body area in greater detail below.BACKThe back segments were the longest at about 23 minutes each.  The A Series focuses mainly on lower back and core stretches; it includes some beginning crunches, prone moves, work on all fours, and a few kneeling and standing stretches to finish.  B Series takes it up a notch with intermediate pelvic tilts, crunches and bridge work.  It also contains more exercises for the hamstrings and more intense low back stretches, including some tough work in the prone position.SHOULDERBoth series consist of about 12 exercises.  In Series A, the stretches are more basic, moving the shoulders through all planes of motion.  There is also some isometric work.  Series B is more active, with many of the exercises being the same as moves that you would typically do with weights.HIP & KNEESeries A focuses includes exercises to mobilize the kneecaps and strengthen the quads.  It includes various hip stretches, including isometric and hip flexor stretches, and the series is performed almost entire on the floor.  In contrast, Series B features stronger stretches for the hips and hamstrings, and it consists mostly of standing work.ANKLE & FOOTThis is the only section where Burns and the women do not wear shoes; each segment is about 13 minutes long.  Series A starts out with manipulative work for the toes and ankles.  Continuing in a seated position, there are various stretches for the toes, ankles, and feet.  Series B offers similar stretches, but from a lying position; this segment ends with additional standing moves.HAND & ELBOWBoth A and B contain 12 exercises and are about 12 minutes long.  The A Series begins with a finger massage and continues into many different types of wrist stretches, including some isometric movements.  In Series B, there are more active finger stretches and then a different sequence of wrist stretches.ABDOMINALThese series are short at about 11 minutes each.  Both A and B follow a similar pattern:  the series begins in a standing position for a brief stretch, then moves to the floor for a series of abdominal crunches and bridge work.  Series A includes isometric moves, whereas Series B includes more intermediate/advanced crunches.  Both series end with a brief stretch.FLEXIBILITYBoth of the series in the Flexibility portion offer a sequence of stretches for the entire body, and thus these segments would work well for stretching after a workout.  The two segments are actually quite similar, covering areas such as wrists, low back, mid/upper back, chest, groin, hips, hamstrings, and ankles; perhaps the only differences are that Series A includes neck stretches, and Series B goes into the stretches a bit more deeply.As the DVD case notes, these workouts are designed to rehab the body, and so they would be excellent for anyone suffering from a sports-specific injury--for example, the shoulder rehab for golfers.  However, the entire DVD is ideal for anyone who would like to improve posture and increase flexibility.  I know that I will appreciate having this DVD on hand both for when I feel the need to get some extra stretching in or especially whenever I might be experiencing any specific aches and pains that need to be addressed.  The only thing that I did not like about this DVD was the music; the case describes it as having ""great music and high energy,"" but I found the fast-paced music jarring for a workout billed as gentle and rehabilitative in nature.  Otherwise, however, this is definitely a valuable addition to a home exercise video library, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",5,"Excellent DVD featuring exercises for rehabilitation, stretching, and flexibility",1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,4339,"['DVD', 'instructor', 'JB', 'Burns', 'also', 'known', 'JB', 'Burns', 'Freedom', 'Restoration', 'Series', 'series', 'rehabilitative', 'workouts', 'addressing', 'seven', 'different', 'areas', 'body', 'area', 'Series', 'A', 'more', 'beginning-level', 'bit', 'less', 'intense', 'Series', 'B', 'more', 'intermediate', 'exercises', 'more', 'active', 'stretches', 'total', '14', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'Most', 'workouts', 'are', '15', 'minutes', 'long', 'are', 'as', 'short', '11', 'minutes', 'few', 'are', 'as', 'long', '23', 'minutes', 'workouts', 'feature', 'Burns', 'two', 'female', 'background', 'exercises', 'women', 'are', 'different', 'segment', 'only', 'props', 'are', 'needed', 'are', 'chair', 'mat', 'floorwork', 'have', 'broken', 'down', 'body', 'area', 'greater', 'detail', 'below.BACKThe', 'back', 'segments', 'were', 'longest', 'about', '23', 'minutes', 'A', 'Series', 'mainly', 'lower', 'back', 'core', 'stretches', 'beginning', 'crunches', 'prone', 'moves', 'work', 'fours', 'few', 'kneeling', 'standing', 'stretches', 'finish', 'B', 'Series', 'up', 'notch', 'intermediate', 'pelvic', 'tilts', 'crunches', 'bridge', 'work', 'also', 'more', 'exercises', 'hamstrings', 'more', 'intense', 'low', 'back', 'stretches', 'including', 'tough', 'work', 'prone', 'position.SHOULDERBoth', 'series', 'consist', '12', 'exercises', 'Series', 'A', 'stretches', 'are', 'more', 'basic', 'moving', 'shoulders', 'planes', 'motion', 'also', 'isometric', 'work', 'Series', 'B', 'more', 'active', 'many', 'exercises', 'being', 'same', 'moves', 'would', 'typically', 'do', 'weights.HIP', 'focuses', 'exercises', 'mobilize', 'kneecaps', 'strengthen', 'quads', 'various', 'hip', 'stretches', 'including', 'isometric', 'hip', 'flexor', 'stretches', 'series', 'performed', 'almost', 'entire', 'floor', 'contrast', 'Series', 'B', 'stronger', 'stretches', 'hips', 'hamstrings', 'mostly', 'standing', 'work.ANKLE', 'FOOTThis', 'only', 'section', 'where', 'Burns', 'women', 'do', 'not', 'wear', 'shoes', 'segment', '13', 'minutes', 'long', 'A', 'out', 'manipulative', 'work', 'toes', 'ankles', 'Continuing', 'seated', 'position', 'are', 'various', 'stretches', 'toes', 'ankles', 'feet', 'Series', 'B', 'similar', 'stretches', 'lying', 'position', 'segment', 'additional', 'standing', 'moves.HAND', 'ELBOWBoth', 'A', 'B', 'contain', '12', 'exercises', 'are', '12', 'minutes', 'long', 'A', 'Series', 'finger', 'massage', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'wrist', 'stretches', 'including', 'isometric', 'movements', 'Series', 'B', 'are', 'more', 'active', 'finger', 'stretches', 'then', 'different', 'sequence', 'wrist', 'stretches.ABDOMINALThese', 'series', 'are', 'short', '11', 'minutes', 'A', 'B', 'follow', 'similar', 'pattern', 'series', 'standing', 'position', 'brief', 'stretch', 'then', 'floor', 'series', 'abdominal', 'crunches', 'bridge', 'work', 'A', 'isometric', 'moves', 'whereas', 'Series', 'B', 'more', 'intermediate/advanced', 'crunches', 'series', 'end', 'brief', 'stretch.FLEXIBILITYBoth', 'series', 'Flexibility', 'portion', 'offer', 'sequence', 'stretches', 'entire', 'body', 'thus', 'segments', 'would', 'work', 'well', 'stretching', 'workout', 'two', 'segments', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'similar', 'covering', 'areas', 'such', 'wrists', 'low', 'back', 'mid/upper', 'back', 'chest', 'groin', 'hips', 'hamstrings', 'ankles', 'perhaps', 'only', 'differences', 'are', 'Series', 'A', 'neck', 'stretches', 'Series', 'B', 'stretches', 'bit', 'more', 'deeply.As', 'DVD', 'case', 'notes', 'workouts', 'are', 'designed', 'rehab', 'body', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'anyone', 'suffering', 'sports-specific', 'injury', 'example', 'shoulder', 'rehab', 'golfers', 'However', 'entire', 'DVD', 'ideal', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'improve', 'posture', 'increase', 'flexibility', 'know', 'will', 'appreciate', 'having', 'DVD', 'hand', 'when', 'feel', 'need', 'get', 'extra', 'stretching', 'especially', 'whenever', 'might', 'be', 'experiencing', 'specific', 'aches', 'pains', 'need', 'be', 'addressed', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'DVD', 'was', 'music', 'case', 'having', 'great', 'music', 'high', 'energy', 'found', 'fast-paced', 'music', 'jarring', 'workout', 'billed', 'gentle', 'rehabilitative', 'nature', 'Otherwise', 'however', 'definitely', 'valuable', 'addition', 'home', 'exercise', 'video', 'library', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend']",Rehab Your Body at Home: 7 Hours of Rehabilitative Workouts
887295,AWGD0ACATDBKT,B0007QC938,"Cobra Chick ""Miss Tea""","[3, 3]","Seriously, no home should be without this DVD, it's worth 10 times the cost if you've ever had an injury or any type of ache or pain that just wouldn't go away. I bought this on a whim one day when it showed up in my selections. My husband had been limping around for a month every morning after pulling something on the treadmill. I had just finished physical therapy on my upper back and was already suffering from stiffness again. I have a long-standing tight hip problem, and Raynaud's issues in my hands and feet.The DVD has 7 hours of material. I've tried only a fraction of it, but am so impressed with what I've used! First - I started with the shoulder exercises to loosen up my tight shoulders. They work. I try to do them several times a week as I don't always have the greatest posture sitting at a desk all day. Pain is gone. My husband uses the foot and ankle exercises each morning, and is no longer waking up with tight muscles (achilles tendon issue? not sure, he's too stubborn to go to the doctor.) I've had on and off soreness in my hip for 10 years. Anti-inflammatory medication helps, but I no longer like to rely on medication. This is one of the aggravating type of things that never seems to be bothering me when I'm at the doctor's office, so I don't remember to ask. I did the hip and knee exercises. No relief, which was surprising, but I also never got relief from stretching my hip flexors or psoas. So, I moved on to the lower back exercises. Whoa! Relief! Who knew. Whenever I get a twinge in my hip now, I run through the lower back exercises, and I feel better.The final reason I find this DVD so valuable is because of my Raynaud's Syndrome. The hand and foot exercises really get the blood flowing to my extremities. After having two bad infections in my toes in the past two years, because of a lack of circulation, I find I need to do something more to improve the amount of circulation to my extremities. Daily aerobic exercise doesn't seem to be cutting it, but these specific exercises do work. My hands will be cool and almost numb when I start, and will be warm and flexible when I'm done.I haven't had to use the rest of the exercises on the DVD, but I'm sure I'll need them at some point, and they'll be just as useful. There is a general flexibility section that I'll be trying soon. I'll update my review as soon as I've gone through it.",5,Every Home Needs This DVD!,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,2384,"['Seriously', 'home', 'should', 'be', 'DVD', 'worth', '10', 'times', 'cost', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'injury', 'type', 'ache', 'pain', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'bought', 'whim', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'showed', 'up', 'selections', 'husband', 'had', 'been', 'limping', 'around', 'month', 'morning', 'pulling', 'something', 'treadmill', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'physical', 'therapy', 'upper', 'back', 'was', 'already', 'suffering', 'stiffness', 'again', 'have', 'long-standing', 'tight', 'hip', 'problem', 'Raynaud', 'issues', 'hands', 'feet.The', 'DVD', '7', 'hours', 'material', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'only', 'fraction', 'am', 'so', 'impressed', 'what', ""'ve"", 'used', 'First', 'started', 'shoulder', 'loosen', 'up', 'tight', 'shoulders', 'work', 'try', 'do', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'greatest', 'posture', 'sitting', 'desk', 'day', 'Pain', 'gone', 'husband', 'foot', 'ankle', 'exercises', 'morning', 'longer', 'waking', 'up', 'tight', 'muscles', 'achilles', 'tendon', 'issue', 'not', 'sure', 'too', 'stubborn', 'go', 'doctor', ""'ve"", 'had', 'off', 'soreness', 'hip', '10', 'years', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'medication', 'no', 'longer', 'rely', 'medication', 'one', 'aggravating', 'type', 'things', 'never', 'be', 'bothering', 'when', ""'m"", 'doctor', 'office', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ask', 'did', 'hip', 'knee', 'exercises', 'relief', 'was', 'surprising', 'also', 'never', 'got', 'relief', 'stretching', 'hip', 'flexors', 'psoas', 'So', 'moved', 'lower', 'back', 'exercises', 'Whoa', 'Relief', 'Who', 'knew', 'Whenever', 'get', 'twinge', 'hip', 'now', 'run', 'lower', 'back', 'exercises', 'feel', 'better.The', 'final', 'reason', 'find', 'DVD', 'so', 'valuable', 'Raynaud', 'Syndrome', 'hand', 'foot', 'exercises', 'really', 'get', 'blood', 'flowing', 'extremities', 'having', 'two', 'bad', 'infections', 'toes', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'lack', 'circulation', 'find', 'need', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'improve', 'amount', 'circulation', 'extremities', 'Daily', 'aerobic', 'exercise', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'cutting', 'specific', 'exercises', 'do', 'work', 'hands', 'will', 'be', 'cool', 'almost', 'numb', 'when', 'start', 'will', 'be', 'warm', 'flexible', 'when', ""'m"", 'done.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'use', 'rest', 'exercises', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'need', 'point', ""'ll"", 'be', 'just', 'useful', 'general', 'flexibility', 'section', ""'ll"", 'be', 'trying', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'update', 'review', 'as', 'soon', ""'ve"", 'gone']",Rehab Your Body at Home: 7 Hours of Rehabilitative Workouts

By that I mean the physical DVD was bad, not the content. That's why I'm giving this DVD four rather than five stars. Otherwise, it would be five star.These workouts are unique. They're not the typical rehab exercises. And, they really make you feel better and ease any pain you're having. (That's assuming the type of pain you have will respond to exercise and is not more serious.) There are two workouts for each body area. One is a light version and the other one somewhat more advanced. There are seven areas of the body addressed by the workouts.I would have liked to see one for the neck but it isn't offered.The exercises are excellent. They are sort of a combination of some yoga and isometrics. They're all easy and anyone should be able to do them. The workouts are fairly short and yet long enough to do good.J.B. Berns knows his stuff and he's an excellent instructor. I love his isometric DVD and this one is every bit as good. The menu is a bit cheesy and not well done and each section runs into the next one.
