No one seemed to star in a garish manner. I still enjoy the old musicals.,5,A Musical Treat,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,213,"['simple', 'story', 'very', 'nicely', 'portrayed', 'Costuming', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'very', 'supportive', 'way', 'one', 'seemed', 'star', 'garish', 'manner', 'still', 'enjoy', 'old', 'musicals']",N/A

1353938,A1JWSDDIH5Z7DV,B003M7DO4W,D. R. Schryer,"[7, 7]","I am an unabashed fan of June Haver. Unfortunately, only a few of her movies are currently available on DVD. My favorite June Haver movie is this one. Maybe this is in part because this movie also features a very young but very pretty Debbie Reynolds -- another favorite of mine -- in only her second role. Also featured are singer Gordon McCrae and dancer Gene Nelson, but June Haver was the star. To be honest -- despite the fact that I love this movie -- it certainly is not a great one, although it is pleasantly entertaining. But the main reason to acquire this movie, in my opinion, is to see the talented Debbie Reynolds when she was in her teens and the beautiful and very talented June Haver, who once was an outstanding star and deserves to be remembered.",5,For June Haver fans,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,765,"['am', 'unabashed', 'fan', 'June', 'Haver', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'few', 'movies', 'are', 'currently', 'available', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'June', 'Haver', 'movie', 'one', 'Maybe', 'part', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'young', 'very', 'pretty', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'favorite', 'mine', 'only', 'second', 'role', 'Also', 'featured', 'are', 'singer', 'Gordon', 'McCrae', 'dancer', 'Gene', 'Nelson', 'June', 'Haver', 'was', 'star', 'be', 'honest', 'fact', 'love', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'pleasantly', 'entertaining', 'main', 'reason', 'acquire', 'movie', 'opinion', 'see', 'talented', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'when', 'was', 'teens', 'beautiful', 'very', 'talented', 'June', 'Haver', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'outstanding', 'star', 'be', 'remembered']",N/A

Most of the scenes were with June, her sisters and father primarily.  Gene Nelson took a good bit of the credit, too, making the musical into a continuous Vaudeville-type show.  Gordon only had a few spots to sing, which I was disappointed in except for the lovely ""The Rose of Tralee,"" accompanying himself on the piano, and for the title song.  My impression was that Warner Brothers Studio was trying to promote June Haver.  It would have been a far superior and memorable musical with more of Gordon's magnificent voice and musical ability.",3,The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady,1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,632,"['have', 'musical', 'Daughter', 'Rosie', ""O'Grady"", 'June', 'Haver', 'Gordon', 'MacRae', 'Most', 'scenes', 'were', 'June', 'sisters', 'father', 'primarily', 'Gene', 'Nelson', 'took', 'good', 'bit', 'credit', 'too', 'making', 'musical', 'continuous', 'Vaudeville-type', 'show', 'Gordon', 'only', 'had', 'few', 'spots', 'sing', 'was', 'disappointed', 'except', 'lovely', 'Rose', 'Tralee', 'accompanying', 'piano', 'title', 'song', 'impression', 'was', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Studio', 'was', 'trying', 'promote', 'June', 'Haver', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'superior', 'memorable', 'musical', 'more', 'Gordon', 'magnificent', 'voice', 'musical', 'ability']",N/A
