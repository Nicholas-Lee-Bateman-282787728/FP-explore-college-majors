When I saw it I was somewhat let down, since it seemed to lack the emotional punch and era realism of the 1971 original.I found the combination of Billy Dee Williams and James Caan to be a more believable and approachable duo than Sean Maher and Mekhi Phifer.  Though the newer version is worth a look, I wouldn't run right out and buy it without seeing it first.In summary, this movie presents a good retelling, but, in my opinion, lacks the emotional punch and character development of the 1971 original.",3,An adequate remake of the true story of Brian and Gayle,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,625,"['version', 'adequate', 'retelling', 'story', 'Brian', 'Piccolo', 'Gale', 'Sayers', 'Piccolo', 'fight', 'cancer', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'somewhat', 'let', 'down', 'seemed', 'lack', 'emotional', 'punch', 'era', 'realism', '1971', 'original.I', 'found', 'combination', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'James', 'Caan', 'be', 'more', 'believable', 'approachable', 'duo', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'newer', 'version', 'look', 'would', ""n't"", 'run', 'right', 'buy', 'seeing', 'first.In', 'summary', 'movie', 'good', 'retelling', 'opinion', 'emotional', 'punch', 'character', 'development', '1971', 'original']",N/A

""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[1, 1]","Audiences, quite understandably, have deep affection for,  and an emotional connection to,  the original  1971 ""Brian's Song"" starring James Caan and Billy Dee Williams. The TV film was so successful it was subsequently shown in motion picture theatres.While taking nothing away from the emotional power of the 1971 original film, this 2001 Remake is that rare exception that proves to be the equal, at least, to the original.  The film dramatizes the unlikely friendship and bond between soft-spoken, shy Gayle Sayers (his  football team-mates initially  considered Sayers aloof and ""uppity"") and the cocky, joking, smiling,  vibrant Brian Piccolo. Mekhi Phifer and Sean Maher give superb performances.When Sayers badly injures his knee and thinks his football career is over, Piccolo insists he undergo a rigorous routine of training/physical therapy and never give up.  Shortly afterward, Piccolo is tragically stricken with cancer. John Gray directs with restraint and an admirable lack of sentimentality.  This remake offers a much more graphic depiction of the physical toll that cancer took on Piccolo. Cancer may have destroyed Piccolo physically, but it never destroyed his ambition or spirit.  The movie earns our tears honestly and naturally. And, unless you are made of stone, you will cry buckets over this 90 minute movie. My eyes were red and swollen with tears long before the end. I started out laughing and smiling, and then I just couldn't stop crying; so I do recommend plentiful amounts of Kleenex. ""Brian's Song"" is a poignant reminder of the power of friendship and how precious and short life really is.  The 2001 re-make honestly earns a place on the DVD shelf next to the 1971 Original version.",5,"RE-MAKE IS EQUAL TO THE ORIGINAL: UNLESS YOU ARE MADE OF STONE, YOU WILL CRY!!!",1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,1720,"['Audiences', 'quite', 'understandably', 'have', 'deep', 'affection', 'emotional', 'connection', 'original', '1971', 'Brian', 'Song', 'starring', 'James', 'Caan', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'TV', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'was', 'subsequently', 'shown', 'motion', 'picture', 'taking', 'nothing', 'away', 'emotional', 'power', '1971', 'original', 'film', '2001', 'Remake', 'rare', 'exception', 'be', 'equal', 'least', 'original', 'film', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'bond', 'soft-spoken', 'shy', 'Gayle', 'Sayers', 'football', 'team-mates', 'initially', 'considered', 'Sayers', 'aloof', 'uppity', 'cocky', 'joking', 'smiling', 'vibrant', 'Brian', 'Piccolo', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'give', 'superb', 'performances.When', 'Sayers', 'badly', 'knee', 'football', 'career', 'Piccolo', 'rigorous', 'routine', 'training/physical', 'therapy', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'Shortly', 'afterward', 'Piccolo', 'tragically', 'stricken', 'cancer', 'John', 'Gray', 'restraint', 'admirable', 'lack', 'sentimentality', 'remake', 'much', 'more', 'graphic', 'depiction', 'physical', 'toll', 'cancer', 'took', 'Piccolo', 'Cancer', 'may', 'have', 'destroyed', 'Piccolo', 'physically', 'never', 'destroyed', 'ambition', 'spirit', 'movie', 'tears', 'honestly', 'naturally', 'are', 'made', 'stone', 'will', 'cry', 'buckets', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'eyes', 'were', 'red', 'swollen', 'tears', 'long', 'end', 'started', 'out', 'laughing', 'smiling', 'then', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'crying', 'do', 'recommend', 'plentiful', 'amounts', 'Kleenex', 'Brian', 'Song', 'poignant', 'reminder', 'power', 'friendship', 'how', 'precious', 'short', 'life', 'really', '2001', 're-make', 'honestly', 'place', 'DVD', 'shelf', '1971', 'Original', 'version']",N/A

It is based upon the true story of professional football players, Gale Sayers and Brian Piccolo, who played for the Chicago Bears. They became fast friends and were rookie roommates on the road.When Brian begins losing weight inexplicably and coughing up a storm, it doesn't look good. He finally goes to the doctor, where he discovers that he has cancer. Yet, Brian never gives up. He wills himself to live, inspiring Gale to be all that he can be.The film takes the viewer through the beginning of Gale's and Brian's friendship, all the way through to the end. Along the way, it touches on many themes. When Gale reaches the pinnacle of success and stardom in the world of professional football and wins an award, he gives a speech that includes Brian. It is a speech that is guaranteed to bring tears to the viewer.Mekhi Phifer is terrific in the role of Gale Sayers and Sean Maher gives a compelling performance as Brian Piccolo.

It is a serious mistake to attempt to compare the remake with the first version. It is so as times have changed. As to the movie it is excellent. The actors(while not quite on the level of Cann and Williams) were very good, the script was excellent,as was the music. I like the two major changes they made in the film. The larger part for Brian's wife was well done and the actress did it to a T. The reducded emphasis on race was also welcomed as I believe that while this was based on people in the 70's it reflects many of the values of today. The main reason these films are so well liked is that they focus on two men and their character and values. Their playfulness and their deep friendship. The deep bond, they better men, players, and family men as a result of it. It is a movie worth owning, as is the first) as they are movies you will enjoy more the more you watched them.
