1219054,A3PGVJF37JSHFO,B001N4K6M4,MysticJaguar,"[2, 2]","As other reviewers have said, it is a little weird looking at this guys bare chest throughout this video.  I won't go so far as so say it is disrespecting the tradition but it does illustrate that what is here is not traditional.  You do see many forms/postures from Tai Chi, but this presentation is not to learn traditional Tai Chi form like Yang style in it's normal presentation.  This is more like exercise for people who like to think they are doing Tai Chi, which in part is true.  But the presentation is very loose (no shirt) and the last segment is our glorious instructor, in all his bare-chested beauty, showing his moves with weird camera angles and so on.  Kinda like hollywood Tai Chi.  It's a bit like what happened with Yoga when it came to America, watered down and placed in a fast food context (often as a workout rather than an art).So if you want to learn Tai Chi you should know YMAA is the best resource.  This DVD is much more worth your time to get startedSimplified Tai Chi Chuan With Applications.  However, do not start with this oneYang Tai Chi for Beginners with Master Yang, Jwing-Ming (YMAA).  This second DVD is showing a longer form Tai Chi (+100 moves) and is intimidating for a newbie.  Dr Yang, though he is an expert and you will really learn the martial arts meanings of most moves, he tends to talk a little too much going off on (interesting) tangents.  The problem is you learned a move and then are standing there for many minutes listening to an explanation before being able to see and learn the next move.  This pause and break in the teaching is distracting and you can easily loose concentration and interest.",2,"Tai Chi exercises, not learning Tai Chi Form",1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,1658,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'little', 'weird', 'looking', 'guys', 'bare', 'chest', 'video', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'say', 'disrespecting', 'tradition', 'illustrate', 'what', 'here', 'not', 'traditional', 'do', 'see', 'many', 'forms/postures', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'presentation', 'not', 'learn', 'traditional', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'form', 'Yang', 'style', 'normal', 'presentation', 'more', 'exercise', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'think', 'are', 'doing', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'part', 'true', 'presentation', 'very', 'loose', 'shirt', 'last', 'segment', 'glorious', 'instructor', 'bare-chested', 'beauty', 'showing', 'moves', 'weird', 'camera', 'angles', 'so', 'Kinda', 'hollywood', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'bit', 'what', 'happened', 'Yoga', 'when', 'came', 'America', 'watered', 'down', 'placed', 'fast', 'food', 'context', 'often', 'workout', 'rather', 'art', '.So', 'want', 'learn', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'should', 'know', 'YMAA', 'best', 'resource', 'DVD', 'much', 'more', 'worth', 'time', 'get', 'startedSimplified', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Chuan', 'Applications', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'start', 'oneYang', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Beginners', 'Master', 'Yang', 'Jwing-Ming', 'YMAA', 'second', 'DVD', 'showing', 'longer', 'form', 'Tai', 'Chi', '+100', 'intimidating', 'newbie', 'Dr', 'Yang', 'expert', 'will', 'really', 'learn', 'martial', 'arts', 'meanings', 'most', 'moves', 'talk', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'off', 'interesting', 'tangents', 'problem', 'learned', 'move', 'then', 'are', 'standing', 'there', 'many', 'minutes', 'listening', 'explanation', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'learn', 'next', 'move', 'pause', 'break', 'teaching', 'distracting', 'can', 'easily', 'loose', 'concentration', 'interest']",Scott Cole: Discover Tai Chi For Beginners
