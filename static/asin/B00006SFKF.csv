In this case, the re-creation was geared toward television/movie quality rather than a reproduction of a stage theatre performance.And if you are familiar with the works of August Wilson, you will recognize that to adher to the vernacular  - spoken language of a region - is critical to the element of his works.  In this DVD movie, the use of the N word was omitted and that omission is part of history.African American playwright, August Wilson was born in 1945 and has received numerous, that include  Pulitzer Prize honors, ""Fences"" in 1987; and ""The Piano Lesson"" in 1990.  Each of his works chronicle a decade in black experience.  The Piano Lesson takes place in the depression era, the 30's.The story revolves around an old carved upright piano that is symbolic with rich family history that dates back to trading slaves.  The carvings are stunning and each scene depicts a story filled with vivid description.  The plot includes supernatural elements.Actor Charles Dutton has performed as other characters in Wilson's plays and here he plays Boy Willie.  With dreams of owning land like his ancestors, his plan involves selling a piano that belongs to him and his sister Berniece, played by the well-known Alfre Woodard.  However, the piano, an heirloom, is a representation of the past and she refuses to sell it.  The carvings were done by her grandfather, an enslaved plantation carpenter.The movie version of the Piano Lesson was done quite well with some stunning performances by seasoned actors.  Like any well-written play with all the elements required, it lays heavy on meaningful and lengthy dialogue.The Piano Lesson opened onstage in 1984 and became Wilson's second  Pulitzer Prize in 1990.  Supposedly, this Hallmark version is shortened and since I have not read the book, I cannot say how  true to the book it is.  ....MzRizz",5,A battle between the historic past and dreams for the future,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",2004,1998,"['are', 'seriously', 'dramatic', 'theatre', 'plays', 'may', 'agree', 're-creations', 'made', 'movies', 'televisions', 'are', 'often', 'substandard', 'book', 'case', 're-creation', 'was', 'geared', 'television/movie', 'quality', 'rather', 'reproduction', 'stage', 'theatre', 'performance.And', 'are', 'familiar', 'works', 'August', 'Wilson', 'will', 'recognize', 'adher', 'vernacular', 'spoken', 'language', 'region', 'critical', 'element', 'works', 'DVD', 'movie', 'use', 'N', 'word', 'was', 'omitted', 'omission', 'part', 'history.African', 'American', 'playwright', 'August', 'Wilson', 'was', 'born', '1945', 'received', 'numerous', 'include', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'honors', 'Fences', '1987', 'Piano', 'Lesson', '1990', 'works', 'chronicle', 'decade', 'black', 'experience', 'Piano', 'Lesson', 'place', 'depression', 'era', ""30's.The"", 'story', 'revolves', 'old', 'carved', 'upright', 'piano', 'symbolic', 'rich', 'family', 'history', 'back', 'trading', 'slaves', 'carvings', 'are', 'stunning', 'scene', 'story', 'filled', 'vivid', 'description', 'plot', 'supernatural', 'elements.Actor', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'performed', 'other', 'characters', 'Wilson', 'plays', 'here', 'Boy', 'Willie', 'dreams', 'owning', 'land', 'ancestors', 'plan', 'selling', 'piano', 'sister', 'Berniece', 'played', 'well-known', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'However', 'piano', 'heirloom', 'representation', 'past', 'sell', 'carvings', 'were', 'done', 'grandfather', 'enslaved', 'plantation', 'carpenter.The', 'movie', 'version', 'Piano', 'Lesson', 'was', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'stunning', 'performances', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'well-written', 'play', 'elements', 'required', 'heavy', 'meaningful', 'lengthy', 'dialogue.The', 'Piano', 'Lesson', 'opened', 'onstage', '1984', 'became', 'Wilson', 'second', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', '1990', 'Supposedly', 'Hallmark', 'version', 'shortened', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'how', 'true', 'book', '.MzRizz']",N/A
