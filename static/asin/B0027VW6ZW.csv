This is a great production of a very timely story, although the DVD quality leaves much to be desired.

1254673,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B0027VW6ZW,Michael Valdivielso,"[5, 5]","1984, the classical 1954 BBC television version is full of great stars and wonderful images.  They do a great job of following the story and trying to keep the feel of the novel.  Peter Cushing plays Winston Smith and of course can be seen in such great films asStar Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)and he is also known to me as the big screen Dr. Who as inThe Doctor Who Collection.  His thin, tired looking body and his skills as an actor make him a perfect Smith.  Andre Morell who played O'Brien is also known for playing Professor Bernard Quatermass inQuatermass And The Pit.  Of course, this version was adapted for the BBC by Nigel Kneale, who invented Quatermass.  Andre's manners, his calm demeanor, his appearance all screams power.  Wonderful!  Yvonne Mitchell is lovely to look at and seems to be a good actress.  Her down fall is made all the more terrible in the end by the change in her appearance - she goes from pretty to ugly.  I thought they had replaced her!  Donald Pleasence who plays Syme in this version also plays Parsons in the later version of1984and does a wonderful job of being a loyal party member who, frankly, knows just a little too much on how the system works.  Campbell Gray who plays Parsons in this version is perfect for the part.  Kind of reminds me of Aubrey Morris but they are two different people.If you are a fan of the BBC or 1984, get this DVD.",5,A star filled movie,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,1438,"['1984', 'classical', '1954', 'BBC', 'television', 'version', 'full', 'great', 'stars', 'wonderful', 'images', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'following', 'story', 'trying', 'keep', 'feel', 'novel', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'Winston', 'Smith', 'course', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'such', 'great', 'films', 'asStar', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'IV', 'New', 'Hope', '1977', '2004', 'Versions', '2-Disc', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'also', 'known', 'big', 'screen', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'inThe', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Collection', 'thin', 'tired', 'looking', 'body', 'skills', 'actor', 'make', 'perfect', 'Smith', 'Andre', 'Morell', 'who', 'played', ""O'Brien"", 'also', 'known', 'playing', 'Professor', 'Bernard', 'Quatermass', 'inQuatermass', 'Pit', 'course', 'version', 'was', 'adapted', 'BBC', 'Nigel', 'Kneale', 'who', 'invented', 'Quatermass', 'Andre', 'manners', 'calm', 'demeanor', 'appearance', 'screams', 'power', 'Wonderful', 'Yvonne', 'Mitchell', 'lovely', 'look', 'be', 'good', 'actress', 'down', 'fall', 'made', 'more', 'terrible', 'end', 'change', 'appearance', 'pretty', 'ugly', 'thought', 'had', 'replaced', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'who', 'Syme', 'version', 'also', 'Parsons', 'later', 'version', 'of1984and', 'wonderful', 'job', 'being', 'loyal', 'party', 'member', 'who', 'frankly', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'how', 'system', 'Campbell', 'Gray', 'who', 'Parsons', 'version', 'perfect', 'part', 'Kind', 'reminds', 'Aubrey', 'Morris', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'people.If', 'are', 'fan', 'BBC', '1984', 'get', 'DVD']",Nineteen Eighty Four

Orwell's tale of a futuristic society actually caused a great deal of controversy when it first aired due to the scenes of torture, most of which is implied rather than shown.  Peter Cushing's portrayal of Winston Smith may just be his best work, his performance carries the story. The rest of the cast is also good, though only Andre Morell and Donald Pleasance are known to American viewers.  Morell is much better here than he was as Watson in Hammer's ""Hound of the Baskervilles"", while Pleasance has less to do before his character no longer exists.  The black and white photography helps to convey the dreary atmosphere necessary to the story.  It starts out slow, but soon draws the viewer into the story and refuses to let go until the credits roll.",5,Incredible,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,804,"['1954', 'BBC', 'production', 'amazing', 'watch', 'Orwell', 'tale', 'futuristic', 'society', 'actually', 'caused', 'great', 'deal', 'controversy', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'due', 'scenes', 'torture', 'most', 'implied', 'rather', 'shown', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'portrayal', 'Winston', 'Smith', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'performance', 'story', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'good', 'only', 'Andre', 'Morell', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'are', 'known', 'American', 'viewers', 'Morell', 'much', 'better', 'here', 'was', 'Watson', 'Hammer', 'Hound', 'Baskervilles', 'Pleasance', 'less', 'do', 'character', 'no', 'longer', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'convey', 'dreary', 'atmosphere', 'necessary', 'story', 'out', 'slow', 'soon', 'viewer', 'story', 'let', 'go', 'credits', 'roll']",Nineteen Eighty Four

I agree that this version of ""1984"" with Peter Cushing and produced by the BBC in 1954 is the best ever produced, with stark performances and the most chilling portrayal of a totalitarian government I've seen.  But this DVD is obviously a bootleg import, and for Amazon to be selling it with no mention of its true nature is deceptive at best.  There are numerous video artifacts: pixellation in the video as well as innumerable specks, lines, and a constant flickering.  This identical release has been duplicated on two other Amazon products: B0025ZIG8Q and B002KECK1G - all of which are of the same poor quality.

Peter Cushing starring as our hero facing a cold heartless goverment of the future, where ""Big Brother"" monitors your every movment.
