1336850,A1DI7507KN7WTI,B003CRM6RI,"Lisa ""Juggling Mom""","[3, 3]","The movie is sweet and sentimental.  The main character figures out that giving to others is a lot more fulfilling than simply being a slacker.  The kids figure out that being a team is more successful than everyone looking out for themselves.  A father figures out how to nurture and support his son.  All this with a nice romance developing between two characters who are easy to like.  I enjoyed the interplay between the main character and his group of friends, as well as the little bit of interplay we are shown between the teammates.  Overall, this is an enjoyable movie with a good cast.

Perhaps Dancy/Coach is a metaphor for the movie:  aimless, uncommitted, bemused.  Of course, since the story is so cliched, I realize that Dancy/Coach will become more committed as the movie progresses.
