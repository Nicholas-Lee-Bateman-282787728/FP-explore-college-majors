When Marcos reveals the kidnapping to the girl, the conflict arises.There is some explicit sex, but it is minimal, and should not detract from anyone's enjoyment of this movie.There are layers of subtlety here.Marco's wife earns some money selling all kinds of things in the Mexico subway, among them cakes made with (Eeeek) Sugus.

980855,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B000EZ8ZRG,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[23, 29]","In BATALLA EN EL CIELO, we are presented with an unflinchingly gritty glimpse into the lives of three individuals struggling with double lives, sexual and social identity in a world that is alternately cruel and nihilistic.  Marco (Marcos Hernandez) drives Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz), the wealthy daughter of an influential family.  They also confide in one another their deepest and most disturbing secrets.  Marco and his wife have kidnapped a young child they are holding for ransom.  Ana moonlights as a prostitute, as an escape from her mundane and pampered existence.  The two of them have also engaged in trysts kept in secret from their families and the rest of the world.  (Which are graphically depicted in the film in a style that can be described as anything but dignified.)For me, the title of this film, alone, is a great paradox that is left to us audience members to ponder.  Is this reference intended to be biblical or cautionary?  Just what is it that the characters are battling in heaven?  Is it a crisis of consciousness?  Are they questioning their own morality (or lack thereof) in the face of relentless alienation?  Particularly, for me, the character of the (at times) catatonic Marco is at once pathetic, as he blankly gazes into the distance, as well as poignant.  You can hardly call him the ""hero"" of this story.  He is more like the hapless anti-hero.  It wasn't so much that I hated him, but, throughout the course of the movie, it was a rare occasion that I felt any connection with him at all, much less the acts that he commits.  They are presented as incidental episodes (be they sexual or violent acts).  It was very hard for me to form any connection with him or with Ana, nor with any of the other characters in the film.BATTLE IN HEAVEN has been criticized and earned censorship as well as praise.  This is due to the graphic nature of the sex scenes, as well as what has been perceived as an exploitative look at Mexico City and the nature of its people.  We see scenes of soccer matches juxtaposed with soldiers doing their militaristic marches, as well as people engaging in detached sexual activity (maybe the better word for this is soul-less).This is not a film I can easily recommend as a good introduction to Mexican cinema because it unfortunately left me cold and without a sense of any really deep emotion at all nor any deeper insight into the culture that is depicted in it.",2,"a crude, sobering and disturbing look at present day Mexico City......",1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,2425,"['BATALLA', 'EN', 'EL', 'CIELO', 'are', 'presented', 'unflinchingly', 'gritty', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'three', 'individuals', 'struggling', 'double', 'lives', 'sexual', 'social', 'identity', 'world', 'alternately', 'cruel', 'nihilistic', 'Marco', 'Marcos', 'Hernandez', 'Ana', 'Anapola', 'Mushkadiz', 'wealthy', 'daughter', 'influential', 'family', 'also', 'confide', 'one', 'deepest', 'most', 'disturbing', 'secrets', 'Marco', 'wife', 'have', 'kidnapped', 'young', 'child', 'are', 'holding', 'ransom', 'Ana', 'moonlights', 'prostitute', 'escape', 'mundane', 'pampered', 'existence', 'two', 'have', 'also', 'engaged', 'trysts', 'kept', 'secret', 'families', 'rest', 'world', 'are', 'graphically', 'depicted', 'film', 'style', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'anything', 'dignified', 'title', 'film', 'alone', 'great', 'paradox', 'left', 'audience', 'members', 'ponder', 'reference', 'intended', 'be', 'biblical', 'cautionary', 'Just', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'battling', 'heaven', 'crisis', 'consciousness', 'Are', 'questioning', 'own', 'morality', 'lack', 'thereof', 'face', 'relentless', 'alienation', 'Particularly', 'character', 'times', 'catatonic', 'Marco', 'once', 'pathetic', 'distance', 'as', 'well', 'poignant', 'can', 'hardly', 'call', 'hero', 'story', 'more', 'hapless', 'anti-hero', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'hated', 'course', 'movie', 'was', 'rare', 'occasion', 'felt', 'connection', 'much', 'less', 'acts', 'are', 'presented', 'incidental', 'episodes', 'be', 'sexual', 'violent', 'acts', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'form', 'connection', 'Ana', 'other', 'characters', 'film.BATTLE', 'IN', 'HEAVEN', 'been', 'criticized', 'earned', 'censorship', 'as', 'well', 'praise', 'due', 'graphic', 'nature', 'sex', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'been', 'perceived', 'exploitative', 'look', 'Mexico', 'City', 'nature', 'people', 'see', 'scenes', 'soccer', 'matches', 'juxtaposed', 'soldiers', 'doing', 'militaristic', 'marches', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'engaging', 'detached', 'sexual', 'activity', 'maybe', 'better', 'word', 'soul-less', '.This', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'recommend', 'good', 'introduction', 'Mexican', 'cinema', 'unfortunately', 'left', 'cold', 'sense', 'really', 'deep', 'emotion', 'deeper', 'insight', 'culture', 'depicted']",Battle In Heaven

980859,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000EZ8ZRG,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[12, 15]","This film was surly something. The opening and closing scene of this film insures that it would had never been play at a multi-plex near you. Battle in Heaven is a curious piece by Mexican director Carlos Reygadas. Sexually explicit, but largely unerotic, Reygadas explores the human body with a stark realism that isn't always easy on the eye and these actors are real people,...... and it shows.In this story we have Marco (Marcos Hernandez) who has been a chauffeur for a General of the Army for fifteen years. His unnamed wife (Bertha Ruiz) hawks alarm clocks and pastry in a metro station. Both are middle-aged, unattractive, and overweight, the antithesis of Hollywood glamor. The film is framed by sexual acts, and explicitly realistic Dumont-like sex is sprinkled throughout, apparently designed to tweak our level of comfort rather than turn us on. As part of his job, Marcos chauffeurs the elite General's rebellious young daughter Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz) around town and he is the only one who knows about her secret life, turning tricks in a brothel. To clear the air and perhaps to receive some of her favors, Marcos admits to her that he and his wife kidnapped the baby of a friend and that the baby died accidentally.Transcending racial taboos and class differences, Ana agrees to have sex with her driver but tells him to turn himself in to the police. Persuaded by his wife, however, he decides to wait until after the procession of Catholics to the shrine of the Lady of Guadeloupe.Reygadas challenges our visual ideals about screen sex by zooming in on Marcos's flabby physique and his wife's pimpled, varicose veined flesh. There's no getting around the fact that neither of them were at the front of the queue when good looks were given out, and in many respects Reygadas has done something unique here with the sex scenes. But the end result of his experimentation serves as a distraction from the principle story and only adds to the alienation we're already beginning to feel towards his expressionless, unfathomable characters. They're totally lifeless and did not even engage me at all. I found myself wondering how much time had passed and wishing for shots to complete rather than watching the same shot for the next ten to fifteen seconds. A feeling I felt once before with The House of Mirth.The music was sort of interesting and I read that the director spent 7 weeks just on the sound. My guess, two weeks on the rest of the film. Personally this film could of been told in under thirty minutes. The rest comprises of long, slow moving shots of people walking, standing, corridors, buildings, scenery, and non too erotic sex. Now when I talk about slow shots, I am talking about a five to ten second slow pan showing a character turn their head one way, followed by another long shot of their head turning the other way and the camera turning again. Or the excruciating scenes of characters just standing and looking. It was difficult to wait for the camera to catch up. The movie needed so much more editing, as it stand it would bring it down to a short, but there were many aspects of the story that could have actually been attempted to be explored on screen, even in a minimalist way. You better off watching another Mexican films like ""Lolo,"" ""Vera,"" ""Japon,"" Pulque's Song"" or a favorite of mine ""Amores Perros.""",2,[2.5]--You got to see it to believe it.,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,3351,"['film', 'was', 'surly', 'something', 'opening', 'closing', 'scene', 'film', 'would', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'play', 'multi-plex', 'Battle', 'Heaven', 'curious', 'piece', 'Mexican', 'director', 'Carlos', 'Reygadas', 'Sexually', 'explicit', 'largely', 'unerotic', 'Reygadas', 'human', 'body', 'stark', 'realism', ""n't"", 'always', 'easy', 'eye', 'actors', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'story', 'have', 'Marco', 'Marcos', 'Hernandez', 'who', 'been', 'chauffeur', 'General', 'Army', 'fifteen', 'years', 'unnamed', 'wife', 'Bertha', 'Ruiz', 'hawks', 'alarm', 'clocks', 'pastry', 'metro', 'station', 'are', 'middle-aged', 'unattractive', 'overweight', 'antithesis', 'Hollywood', 'glamor', 'film', 'framed', 'sexual', 'acts', 'explicitly', 'realistic', 'Dumont-like', 'sex', 'sprinkled', 'apparently', 'designed', 'tweak', 'level', 'comfort', 'rather', 'turn', 'part', 'job', 'Marcos', 'elite', 'General', 'rebellious', 'young', 'daughter', 'Ana', 'Anapola', 'Mushkadiz', 'town', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'secret', 'life', 'turning', 'tricks', 'brothel', 'clear', 'air', 'perhaps', 'receive', 'favors', 'Marcos', 'wife', 'kidnapped', 'baby', 'friend', 'baby', 'died', 'accidentally.Transcending', 'racial', 'taboos', 'class', 'differences', 'Ana', 'have', 'sex', 'driver', 'turn', 'police', 'Persuaded', 'wife', 'however', 'wait', 'procession', 'Catholics', 'shrine', 'Lady', 'Guadeloupe.Reygadas', 'visual', 'ideals', 'screen', 'sex', 'zooming', 'Marcos', 'flabby', 'physique', 'wife', 'pimpled', 'varicose', 'veined', 'flesh', 'getting', 'fact', 'were', 'front', 'queue', 'when', 'good', 'looks', 'were', 'given', 'out', 'many', 'respects', 'Reygadas', 'done', 'something', 'unique', 'here', 'sex', 'scenes', 'end', 'result', 'experimentation', 'distraction', 'principle', 'story', 'only', 'alienation', ""'re"", 'already', 'beginning', 'feel', 'expressionless', 'unfathomable', 'characters', ""'re"", 'totally', 'lifeless', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'engage', 'found', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'had', 'passed', 'wishing', 'shots', 'complete', 'rather', 'watching', 'same', 'shot', 'next', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'seconds', 'feeling', 'felt', 'once', 'House', 'Mirth.The', 'music', 'was', 'sort', 'interesting', 'read', 'director', 'spent', '7', 'weeks', 'just', 'sound', 'My', 'guess', 'two', 'weeks', 'rest', 'film', 'Personally', 'film', 'could', 'been', 'told', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'rest', 'comprises', 'long', 'slow', 'moving', 'shots', 'people', 'walking', 'standing', 'corridors', 'buildings', 'scenery', 'non', 'too', 'erotic', 'sex', 'Now', 'when', 'talk', 'slow', 'shots', 'am', 'talking', 'five', 'ten', 'second', 'slow', 'pan', 'showing', 'character', 'turn', 'head', 'one', 'way', 'followed', 'long', 'shot', 'head', 'turning', 'other', 'way', 'camera', 'turning', 'again', 'excruciating', 'scenes', 'characters', 'just', 'standing', 'looking', 'was', 'difficult', 'wait', 'camera', 'catch', 'up', 'movie', 'needed', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'editing', 'would', 'bring', 'down', 'short', 'were', 'many', 'aspects', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'attempted', 'be', 'explored', 'screen', 'even', 'minimalist', 'way', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'Mexican', 'films', 'Lolo', 'Vera', 'Japon', 'Pulque', 'Song', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Amores', 'Perros']",Battle In Heaven

980861,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000EZ8ZRG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","&lt;strong>Batalla en el Cielo&lt;/strong> (Carlos Reygadas, 2005)How the hell does one review a movie like &lt;em>Batalla en el Cielo&lt;/em> (&lt;em>Battle in Heaven&lt;/em> in English)? It almost seems to sit far enough outside the realms of conventional filmmaking (and by ""conventional"" I am not only referring to Michael Bay but to the accepted standards of avant-garde filmmaking a la Tarr or Weerasethakul here) to both defy any critical approach and to dare critics to try and find a way by crouching on the battlements and yelling obscenities. It's simple: while the movie draws on any number of influences (both its plotlines are pretty well-trod classics), it still manages to do things with those plotlines it's pretty much impossible to figure. And I should say that by ""plotlines"" I'm referring far more to setup than I am to structure; there is much less plot to this film than any synopsis would have you believe.But still, I am inclined to offer one, if only to provide the same sense of setup Reygadas gives us. The movie centers around Marcos (Marcos Hern&aacute;ndez, who, like all the other principals in the film, had never acted before), a low-level member of the Mexican military whose job seems to be to oversee the raising and lowering of the flag every day at the capitol building in Mexico City. (I'm inferring here, and I apologize for not recognizing the landmarks I should be recognizing.) Marcos is trapped in a loveless marriage to a woman (Bertha Ruiz) who remains unnamed in the film; she runs a stall selling knockoff watches in the subway. The family is close to broke, so the wife hatches a plan: kidnap a baby for ransom. Meanwhile, Marcos, not lacking in the time department, is asked by his superior to play chauffeur to the man's daughter, the seductive, constantly-horny Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz). Marcos becomes obsessed with her almost immediately--not a good mental state to be in when one is in the process of committing a serious crime.I should probably at least consider warning you that at least some of you (and I'm not talking about the Moral Majority here) are going to think this movie is porn. I've found the line on what people consider ""porn"" to be fluid, so I know this is the case. (In detail: the sex scenes are obviously not simulated [or that's the best CGI I've ever seen], though the usual hard-line porn definition--the money shot--is absent.) In fact, since the movie opens with one of these scenes, it almost seems as if Reygadas wanted to start the movie out by kicking the viewer where it hurts. It does feel kind of gratuitous, but like everything else about this movie, it makes me wonder if I'm the one missing something. That parenthetical about my needing to infer about his job was left in by design; Reygadas keeps me wondering throughout if my own cultural ignorance just has me missing important points he's making. (Marcos' family are darker-skinned than Ana; am I reading something into that, or is Reygadas actually saying it? I have no idea.) Add onto this the fact that &lt;em>Battle in Heaven&lt;/em> is never what one could call an enjoyable film, and I'm guessing a lot of viewers will look at that ending and say it isn't satisfying, either (though I am not one of them), and you've got a movie that's proably not going to play well in Skokie. But I'm guessing there's a core audience who are going to latch onto this thing like a puppy on rawhide. The problem is, I can't tell you if you're one of those people; you'll need to watch the thing to find out. ** ",3,"Not entirely irredeemable, but...",1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,3546,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Batalla', 'en', 'el', 'Cielo', 'lt', '>', 'Carlos', 'Reygadas', '2005', 'How', 'hell', 'one', 'review', 'movie', 'lt', '>', 'Batalla', 'en', 'el', 'Cielo', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'Battle', 'Heaven', 'lt', '>', 'English', 'almost', 'sit', 'far', 'enough', 'realms', 'conventional', 'filmmaking', 'conventional', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'referring', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'accepted', 'standards', 'avant-garde', 'filmmaking', 'la', 'Tarr', 'Weerasethakul', 'here', 'defy', 'critical', 'approach', 'dare', 'critics', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'crouching', 'battlements', 'yelling', 'obscenities', 'simple', 'movie', 'draws', 'number', 'influences', 'plotlines', 'are', 'pretty', 'well-trod', 'classics', 'still', 'do', 'things', 'plotlines', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'figure', 'should', 'say', 'plotlines', ""'m"", 'referring', 'far', 'more', 'setup', 'am', 'structure', 'much', 'less', 'plot', 'film', 'synopsis', 'would', 'have', 'believe.But', 'still', 'am', 'inclined', 'offer', 'one', 'only', 'provide', 'same', 'sense', 'setup', 'Reygadas', 'movie', 'centers', 'Marcos', 'Marcos', 'Hern', 'aacute', 'who', 'other', 'principals', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'low-level', 'member', 'Mexican', 'military', 'job', 'be', 'oversee', 'raising', 'lowering', 'flag', 'day', 'capitol', 'building', 'Mexico', 'City', ""'m"", 'inferring', 'here', 'apologize', 'not', 'recognizing', 'landmarks', 'should', 'be', 'recognizing', 'Marcos', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'woman', 'Bertha', 'Ruiz', 'who', 'unnamed', 'film', 'stall', 'selling', 'knockoff', 'watches', 'subway', 'family', 'close', 'broke', 'wife', 'plan', 'kidnap', 'baby', 'ransom', 'Meanwhile', 'Marcos', 'not', 'lacking', 'time', 'department', 'asked', 'superior', 'play', 'chauffeur', 'man', 'daughter', 'seductive', 'constantly-horny', 'Ana', 'Anapola', 'Mushkadiz', 'Marcos', 'obsessed', 'almost', 'immediately', 'not', 'good', 'mental', 'state', 'be', 'when', 'one', 'process', 'committing', 'serious', 'crime.I', 'should', 'probably', 'least', 'consider', 'warning', 'least', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'Moral', 'Majority', 'here', 'are', 'going', 'think', 'movie', 'porn', ""'ve"", 'found', 'line', 'what', 'people', 'consider', 'porn', 'be', 'fluid', 'know', 'case', 'detail', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'obviously', 'not', 'simulated', '[', 'best', 'CGI', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ']', 'usual', 'hard-line', 'porn', 'definition', 'money', 'shot', 'absent', 'fact', 'movie', 'one', 'scenes', 'almost', 'Reygadas', 'wanted', 'start', 'movie', 'out', 'kicking', 'viewer', 'where', 'feel', 'kind', 'gratuitous', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'wonder', ""'m"", 'one', 'missing', 'something', 'parenthetical', 'needing', 'infer', 'job', 'was', 'left', 'design', 'Reygadas', 'wondering', 'own', 'cultural', 'ignorance', 'just', 'missing', 'important', 'points', 'making', 'Marcos', 'family', 'are', 'darker-skinned', 'Ana', 'am', 'reading', 'something', 'Reygadas', 'actually', 'saying', 'have', 'idea', 'Add', 'fact', 'lt', '>', 'Battle', 'Heaven', 'lt', '>', 'never', 'what', 'one', 'could', 'call', 'enjoyable', 'film', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'lot', 'viewers', 'will', 'look', 'ending', 'say', ""n't"", 'satisfying', 'either', 'am', 'not', 'one', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'proably', 'not', 'going', 'play', 'well', 'Skokie', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'core', 'audience', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'latch', 'thing', 'puppy', 'rawhide', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', ""'ll"", 'need', 'watch', 'thing', 'find', 'out', '**']",Battle In Heaven

I don't know if the various hardcore scenes were actually included in the movie when it played theatrically in the United States in 2006.  But they are certainly in the video, and those easily offended by such activity had best be forewarned.For me, the sex scenes themselves are not the problem.  It is the movie as a whole that I object to.  For ""Battle in Heaven"" is a pretentious, arty contrivance that seems to be operating under the assumption - quite rightly perhaps, since the movie ended up on quite a large number of ten best lists last year - that it can earn points with the critical intelligentsia if it can just manage to bore its audience into a state of complete catatonia.It tells the desultory and languid tale of an overweight, middle-aged chauffeur who wanders in a zombie-like daze around Mexico City wracked with guilt over the fact that he and his wife recently kidnapped a child who ended up dying under their care.  During the course of the film, Marcos (Marcos Hernandez) is able to shake himself out of his stupor long enough to have sex with his wife, sex with his boss' daughter and sex with himself while watching a soccer game.  The movie is all about the struggle that is being perpetually waged within the Mexican soul between sex and temptation on the one hand and piety, guilt and the obsessive need for redemption on the other.  And while this theme is certainly a valid one and is actually developed to some extent in the closing scenes of the drama, the movie itself is far too inert, far too easily sidetracked, and far too underdeveloped to capture our interest.",2,"gives ""art films"" a bad name",1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,1946,"['Apparently', 'people', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'faking', 'anymore', 'even', 'when', 'sex', 'movies', 'Mexican', 'film', 'Battle', 'Heaven', 'graphic', 'scene', 'young', 'woman', 'performing', 'oral', 'sex', 'main', 'character', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'not', 'simulation', 'also', 'not', 'much', 'stimulation', 'given', 'man', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'various', 'hardcore', 'scenes', 'were', 'actually', 'included', 'movie', 'when', 'played', 'theatrically', 'United', 'States', '2006', 'are', 'certainly', 'video', 'easily', 'offended', 'such', 'activity', 'had', 'best', 'be', 'forewarned.For', 'sex', 'are', 'not', 'problem', 'movie', 'whole', 'object', 'Battle', 'Heaven', 'pretentious', 'arty', 'contrivance', 'be', 'operating', 'assumption', 'quite', 'rightly', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'large', 'number', 'ten', 'best', 'lists', 'last', 'year', 'can', 'earn', 'points', 'critical', 'intelligentsia', 'can', 'just', 'manage', 'bore', 'audience', 'state', 'complete', 'catatonia.It', 'desultory', 'languid', 'tale', 'overweight', 'middle-aged', 'chauffeur', 'who', 'zombie-like', 'daze', 'Mexico', 'City', 'wracked', 'guilt', 'fact', 'wife', 'recently', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'dying', 'care', 'course', 'film', 'Marcos', 'Marcos', 'Hernandez', 'able', 'shake', 'stupor', 'long', 'enough', 'have', 'sex', 'wife', 'sex', 'boss', 'daughter', 'sex', 'watching', 'soccer', 'game', 'movie', 'struggle', 'being', 'perpetually', 'waged', 'Mexican', 'soul', 'sex', 'temptation', 'one', 'hand', 'piety', 'guilt', 'obsessive', 'need', 'redemption', 'other', 'theme', 'certainly', 'valid', 'one', 'actually', 'developed', 'extent', 'closing', 'scenes', 'drama', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'inert', 'far', 'too', 'easily', 'sidetracked', 'far', 'too', 'underdeveloped', 'capture', 'interest']",Battle In Heaven

The ordinary need not be ugly and bizarre. I might be sounding too critical, but I think the director's plot was way out of line. If the cardinal idea was to portray Mexico's society (as some reviewers have written), then this isn't the right way to do it.Marcos & his wife have kidnapped a child for ransom (not shown) and the child dies (not shown again). Marcos is seemingly (horrible acting by the actor) devastated and is supposed to be full of remorse. But, he snuggles up to his boss's daughter Ana and confides in her. Ana & Marcos get close for a while and she asks Marcos to turn himself in. Marcos (the silly) suddenly finds a redemption path. And just when you think he has been shown the right way, he lands up fatally stabbing Ana and then giving her a bizarre tearful hug. As if this weren't enough, he then walks on his knees to a sacred basilica. The movie ends in heaven with Ana & Marcos in a promiscuous position. He has fatally stabbed a young girl and still has the audacity to say that he loves her.I pity the star cast as well. They didn't have any avenues to show their talent and landed up showing (just) skin.",1,Depressing ...,1179360000,"05 17, 2007",2007,1260,"['Extreme', 'close-ups', 'long', 'stills', 'brutality', 'subtle', 'story-telling', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'necessary', 'ingredients', 'art', 'movie', 'ordinary', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'ugly', 'bizarre', 'might', 'be', 'sounding', 'too', 'critical', 'think', 'director', 'plot', 'was', 'way', 'line', 'cardinal', 'idea', 'was', 'portray', 'Mexico', 'society', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'then', ""n't"", 'right', 'way', 'do', 'it.Marcos', 'wife', 'have', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'ransom', 'not', 'shown', 'child', 'dies', 'not', 'shown', 'again', 'Marcos', 'seemingly', 'horrible', 'acting', 'actor', 'devastated', 'supposed', 'be', 'full', 'remorse', 'up', 'boss', 'daughter', 'Ana', 'confides', 'Ana', 'Marcos', 'get', 'close', 'while', 'Marcos', 'turn', 'Marcos', 'silly', 'suddenly', 'redemption', 'path', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'been', 'shown', 'right', 'way', 'up', 'fatally', 'stabbing', 'Ana', 'then', 'giving', 'bizarre', 'tearful', 'hug', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'then', 'knees', 'sacred', 'basilica', 'movie', 'heaven', 'Ana', 'Marcos', 'promiscuous', 'position', 'fatally', 'stabbed', 'young', 'girl', 'still', 'audacity', 'say', 'her.I', 'pity', 'star', 'cast', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'avenues', 'show', 'talent', 'landed', 'up', 'showing', 'just', 'skin']",Battle In Heaven
