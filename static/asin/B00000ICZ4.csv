The series is about a warlock who is summoned forth by his enemies to save every one from certain doom.As I mentioned, Bastard is like a role-playing game.  It has a lot of the common role-playing or faerie tale elements within it such as a princess, a maiden in distress, sorcerers, knights, monsters, elementals, and a multitude of villains to boot.This DVD contains all six episodes of the mini series of Bastard.  Bastard has a reputation for being the cheesiest anime every created.  Despite it's reputation, I found it to be well worth it.  The animation is fair and the music is not that hot but the slap-stick comedy and the plot make up for where Bastard lacks.

There have been several &quot;Bastard!!&quot; video games available for the SNES and Sony Playstation and the series has yet to be &quot;fully completed&quot;, although the six-OAV episode arc is just totally awesome!The series is about an evil warlock named &quot;Dark Schneider&quot; who has been freed from imprisonment and fortunately, the evil warlock has been combined with a very good kid named Rushe which makes him somewhat a hero to aid the people of Meta-Rikana&quot; and take on his old generals and army.The storyline is just awesome but since this anime includes combat, humor and wizardry...the battles can be bloody and too violent for some people.All in all, an awesome anime featuring awesome characters (and character designs) such as Ninja Master Gara, Thunder Empress Arshes Nei and more.Check out this anime, you won't be disappointed.",5,"Check out this anime, you won't be disappointed.",1003622400,"10 21, 2001",2001,1227,"['first', 'heard', 'quot', 'Bastard', 'quot', 'series', 'back', 'early', '90', 'recalled', 'many', 'fans', 'anime', 'convention', 'talking', 'how', 'cool', 'series', 'was', 'how', 'funny', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'name', 'Dark', 'Schneider', 'many', 'references', 'popular', 'US', 'metal', 'bands', '80', '.After', 'watching', 'six', 'episodes', 'just', 'fell', 'love', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'quot', 'Bastard', 'quot', 'games', 'available', 'SNES', 'Sony', 'Playstation', 'series', 'yet', 'be', 'quot', 'fully', 'completed', 'quot', 'six-OAV', 'episode', 'arc', 'just', 'totally', 'awesome', 'series', 'evil', 'warlock', 'named', 'quot', 'Dark', 'Schneider', 'quot', 'who', 'been', 'freed', 'imprisonment', 'fortunately', 'evil', 'warlock', 'been', 'combined', 'very', 'good', 'kid', 'named', 'Rushe', 'somewhat', 'hero', 'aid', 'people', 'Meta-Rikana', 'quot', 'take', 'old', 'generals', 'army.The', 'storyline', 'just', 'awesome', 'anime', 'combat', 'humor', 'wizardry', 'battles', 'can', 'be', 'bloody', 'too', 'violent', 'people.All', 'awesome', 'anime', 'featuring', 'awesome', 'characters', 'character', 'designs', 'such', 'Ninja', 'Master', 'Gara', 'Thunder', 'Empress', 'Arshes', 'Nei', 'more.Check', 'out', 'anime', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

Harris,"[1, 5]","This anime was reccomended to me because I liked Fantasy and Role Playing Game elements like magic spells and characters battling eachother.Well, after watching it I am somewhat satisfied and somewhat dissapointed.  The toungue in cheek humor is there, and they aren't obvious.  The Characters don't make funny faces or shake their arms to alert you that a joke has just occured.  Example:  One character gets his arm cut off and contimplates where he remembers seeing the guy who cut his arm off.  He said ""I can't quite put my finger on it"".  ... has it's share of humor and has it's share of impressive battles.  It's just that the characters take too long talking to eachother during the fights that it makes it boring.  I can reccomend this to Anime fans who are looking for a new fantasy Anime to watch.  On the other hand I can not reccomend this to Anime fans who want the same, but haven't first seen much better titles like Magic Knight Rayearth or Slayers the TV series.

You can read the premise above, and the thing is just about as righteous as it sounds. The characters are all pretty badass, and the story plays out well. SOme things needed more explanation, such as Dark Schneiders past, and the way he gets out of a few close scrapes, but otherwise things are pretty solid.  Animation wise it looks like a Jap/American 80's cartoon. Reminded me of a thundercats/sailor moon hybrid in the art department. You know the kind, the mouth moves but the body doesn't, that happens alot. However there are a few really cool scenes where the animation is very fluid. Not too many of the characters are way over the top, but there are a few instances of huge eyes and hanging tear drops.  Oh, and theres a goofy vampire, a typical bumbling fast talking anime badguy(but he's prety neat lookin').THe image quality of the disc is good but not fantastic, it looks like a television series.  The sound, when there is any to really notice, is just fine. The english dub's are good, not annoying, and very familiar if you've heard cowboy bebop or Big O! dubs.Extra's wise, they show a couple toys.As for the show itself, the action is often times gory, and the fights are frequent and pretty damned cool. A lot of magic goin' down. The last episode of the 6 is mighty awesome, when a fight with a cyslops brings together the main cahracters. As far as Fan Service goes(T&amp;A) the show doesn't have anything too bad, a couple boob shots, and Dark Schneider is naked alot, no wangage tho.  OH!  and seeing the princess (who has 1/2 her chest covered by a metal armor plate) run is pretty funny lookin'. just thought i'd throw that in. Overall all the series provides a lot of action for the 24-26 bux you'll drop on this. Not a ton of involving story tho. So if you're into anime for the in depth scripts and emotion, you might wanna pass this one up. If you're into anime for the nudity there are much better shows out there for your 26 bux. However if you're into anime for over the top fight  scenes where stuff is explodin' everwhere and body parts are gettin' blowed off and huge monsters are dukin' it out, this anime is well worth the price tag. I think it was definately worth the 24 i paid at bestBuy. So if yer into Action, go ahead and pick this bad boy up...Thought i was gonna say bastard didnt ya...gotta love the puns.",4,He seemed like a nice guy to me,1011398400,"01 19, 2002",2002,2476,"[""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'experienced', 'Anime', 'whats', 'shown', 'american', 'television', 'as', 'far', 'i', 'know', 'Bastard', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'can', 'read', 'premise', 'thing', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'righteous', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'badass', 'story', 'out', 'well', 'SOme', 'things', 'needed', 'more', 'explanation', 'such', 'Dark', 'Schneiders', 'past', 'way', 'few', 'close', 'scrapes', 'otherwise', 'things', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'Animation', 'wise', 'Jap/American', '80', 'cartoon', 'Reminded', 'thundercats/sailor', 'moon', 'hybrid', 'art', 'department', 'know', 'kind', 'mouth', 'moves', 'body', ""n't"", 'alot', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'really', 'cool', 'scenes', 'where', 'animation', 'very', 'fluid', 'Not', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'way', 'top', 'are', 'few', 'instances', 'huge', 'eyes', 'hanging', 'tear', 'drops', 'Oh', 'goofy', 'vampire', 'typical', 'bumbling', 'fast', 'talking', 'anime', 'badguy', 'prety', 'neat', 'lookin', '.THe', 'image', 'quality', 'disc', 'good', 'not', 'fantastic', 'television', 'series', 'sound', 'when', 'really', 'notice', 'just', 'fine', 'english', 'dub', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'annoying', 'very', 'familiar', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'cowboy', 'bebop', 'Big', 'O', 'dubs.Extra', 'wise', 'show', 'couple', 'toys.As', 'show', 'action', 'often', 'times', 'gory', 'fights', 'are', 'frequent', 'pretty', 'damned', 'cool', 'lot', 'magic', 'goin', 'down', 'last', 'episode', '6', 'mighty', 'awesome', 'when', 'fight', 'cyslops', 'together', 'main', 'cahracters', 'As', 'far', 'Fan', 'Service', 'T', 'amp', 'A', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'too', 'bad', 'couple', 'boob', 'shots', 'Dark', 'Schneider', 'naked', 'alot', 'wangage', 'tho', 'OH', 'seeing', 'princess', 'who', '1/2', 'chest', 'covered', 'metal', 'armor', 'plate', 'run', 'pretty', 'funny', 'lookin', 'just', 'thought', 'i', ""'d"", 'throw', 'series', 'lot', 'action', '24-26', 'bux', ""'ll"", 'drop', 'Not', 'ton', 'involving', 'story', 'tho', 'So', ""'re"", 'anime', 'depth', 'scripts', 'emotion', 'might', 'wan', 'na', 'pass', 'one', 'up', ""'re"", 'anime', 'nudity', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'out', 'there', '26', 'bux', 'However', ""'re"", 'anime', 'top', 'fight', 'scenes', 'where', 'stuff', 'explodin', 'everwhere', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'gettin', 'blowed', 'huge', 'monsters', 'are', 'dukin', 'out', 'anime', 'well', 'price', 'tag', 'think', 'was', 'definately', 'worth', '24', 'i', 'paid', 'bestBuy', 'So', 'yer', 'Action', 'go', 'ahead', 'pick', 'bad', 'boy', 'Thought', 'i', 'was', 'gon', 'say', 'bastard', 'didnt', 'ya', 'got', 'ta', 'puns']",N/A
503455,A1DVOMZARBC277,B00000ICZ4,"Jeremy Moore ""Gowra""","[19, 22]","I dont' know if you have ever heard of this particular series, but I recently purchased it while at the local video store.  It's pretty cool.  Kind of reminds me of lodoss war, in the sense that every living creature is like a giant bag of blood, and if you're cut BAM!!!  you spring a leak like a water mane busting.I noted the main character, Dark Schneider, or Darsh,  is very intreguing.  His character progresses quiet nicely throught the series, going from not quiet pure evil to a reluctant hero.  IF you think you;ve seen someone with more ego than this guy, you're probably wrong, but on the plus side this 400 year old mage has the power to back up his mouth.The first (of 6) episode, an annoying mage, with some power, is attacking the town, now Darsh is freed from his imprisonment, inside a small boy to fight this threat.  He can only be freed if kissed by a virgin.  Fortuantely, Yoko, Rusha's best friend (the small boy who house's this super mage) has been unwittingly prepared for this day her whole life.OF course, being evil as he is, and having been iprisoned for the last 15 years, Darsh decides, as his first act, to kill everyone instead, but the invader gets in the way, and cuts darsh's face, drawing blood.  Then Dark's power is unleashed, and the invader (calls himself the invisible.... I can't remember his name)  gets a heaping helping of a dish I call severe pain laced with VENOM (watch teh show you'll get why I spelled it in caps).Now the big picture:You see Darsh's old generals, his ex girlfiriend, and his old army have decided to take over the world like he would have if he hadn't been imprisoned.  The four generals, are pretty cool.  Althought I think they were based off Record of Lodoss War, or it was based on them, one or the other.One, a ninja master, reminds me of Ashram from Record of Lodoss War.  While the ex-girlfriend, and Darsh's adopted duaghter. (there's a long story in that one turst me it's better to see than hear) is like Pirotause.  The last two guys are a mage of undead creautes is who reminded me of Wagnard, where as the ice mage (a very interesting character who gets very little screen time, and when he is there, it's merely to look good.  but when he does act... cool) acts a lot like Ashram as well.Reluctantly Darsh takes them all on (along the way killing a  vampire/mage who just seems to cry out for a beating, trust me one look and you'll agree)  and being nigh immortal, unleashes a super does of pain to his enemies.A happy ending, but I get the feelign there was supposed to be another series, since the last battle is won, but there are a few lose ends left untended to.If you liked Record of Lodoss War or Fist of the North Star, you would probably love this series.  My only true complaint is that this series wasn't longer.

It has it's own brand of crass anti-hero mixed with shrieky heroine, that is at first somewhat disturbing and cliche, yet comes off with real integrity. It has a lot to do with the main character and his friends, all of whom begin the series as maniacal tyrants, and end it as sympathetic heroes. The 6 OAV episodes serve as an introduction to the comic book series, but make a complete story arc themselves. The video looks sharp and colorful, the dolby digital 2.0 soundtrack is solid. I have to say, what a great dub! I was surprised to say the least, but the voices fit the characters well, and the voice acting is dead on. And it really needed to be, to capture the difficult emotional tone of the show. The subtitle is good also and both include the classic line &quot;Human beings were miserably inadequate...&quot;. The show makes innumerable references to 80's heavy metal and rock bands but these are downplayed a bit in this translation. The animated menus have to be the best looking I have seen on an anime DVD. Without question this DVD comes with my highest recommendation. The story is not for everyone but this is a great series and DVD.",5,Human beings were miserably inadequate...,1007856000,"12 9, 2001",2001,1226,"['Bastard', 'now', 'favorite', 'mine', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'own', 'brand', 'crass', 'anti-hero', 'mixed', 'shrieky', 'heroine', 'first', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'cliche', 'yet', 'off', 'real', 'integrity', 'lot', 'do', 'main', 'character', 'friends', 'whom', 'begin', 'series', 'maniacal', 'tyrants', 'end', 'sympathetic', 'heroes', '6', 'OAV', 'episodes', 'serve', 'introduction', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'make', 'complete', 'story', 'arc', 'video', 'sharp', 'colorful', 'dolby', 'digital', '2.0', 'soundtrack', 'solid', 'have', 'say', 'what', 'great', 'dub', 'was', 'surprised', 'say', 'least', 'voices', 'fit', 'characters', 'well', 'voice', 'acting', 'dead', 'really', 'needed', 'be', 'capture', 'difficult', 'emotional', 'tone', 'show', 'subtitle', 'good', 'also', 'include', 'classic', 'line', 'quot', 'Human', 'beings', 'were', 'miserably', 'inadequate', 'quot', 'show', 'innumerable', 'references', '80', 'heavy', 'metal', 'rock', 'bands', 'are', 'bit', 'translation', 'animated', 'menus', 'have', 'be', 'best', 'looking', 'have', 'seen', 'anime', 'DVD', 'question', 'DVD', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'story', 'not', 'everyone', 'great', 'series', 'DVD']",N/A

There is nudity and much sexual joking in the film, as well as a lot of rather graphic violence. In fact, I think this was done consciously to make fun of some of the various anime cliches. If you don't mind that, it's a rip-roaring adventure that is a lot of fun to watch. The hero is so audiacious and shallow at times that you want to dislike him, but his antics are just too much fun to watch. The main flaw that I saw was that too much plot was crammed into too little time. So much more could have been said about the pasts of the characters and thier feelings for eachother, and the ending seems very rushed. Truthfully, there is plenty of room for a sequel, as the ending leaves many ""loose-ends"" unresolved.

You could pray to your Gods or refuse to answer the city gates and hope they go away but that may not work.

503463,A3FIKATQ286DMV,B00000ICZ4,Niko,"[7, 10]","The story goes more or less like this: Schneider is the strongest Magician who has been sealed inside the body of a young boy. In order to be awakened a woman or a girl that is 'pure' has to kiss the boy.So why should somebody want to awaken this guy anyway? Well, the ones who had sealed him are facing a great threat and the only one who can stop this threat is Schneider himself. However, the situation is a little bit complicated than it may appear because:a) The enemy is Schmeider's ex-generals who continue to fight and are trying to conquer the world (something that he also was trying to do)b) One of the generals is Schneider's ex(and new) girlfriend. Confused? Well, watch the show and you will understand and that:At first, the hero, or should I say anti-hero, is this guy Dark Schneider, who although would prefer to kill everyone ends up in protecting them. Second, you have to give him credit for it, because I haven't seen any anime before (and trust me I have seen a bunch of them), where the hero when opening his mouth comes up with so much ""stuff"" that:a) you cannot stop laughing,b) has no intention in closing it,c) his ego knows no limits but fortunately for him he is able to back up his words, I mean he is a 400 year old super magician, at least he should be good in one thing, while he proofs himself to be good in many things,d )the only one that he respects is himself and his ultimate ego (seriously, he is able to come up with any possible excuse for his actions that is unbelievable amazing how someone can actually do it),e)prefers before killing his enemy to come up with so much ""stuff"" that humiliate the enemy (consider this, Shishio in Kenshin during the final battles and how he treated his opponents, well the main deference is that Shishio, compared to Dark Schneider, 'behaves' more gentle with his opponents, I assume you get the picture)f) although, he is not the most loyal guy around, when time comes he does the ultimate sacrifice for his, ex and new girlfriend, without hesitation but of course with the necessary blubberingg)I have to admit, that the storyline may not be the best that is out there, but it is still a good oneh)For the price, it is definitely worth buying it and having 3 enjoyable hours, following the main character in his constantly ""trespassing"" of ...i) Although he is supposed to be a bad guy, you will love himj) I admit that the story finishes a little bit ""fast"" but it manages to put all the pieces together and leaves not much unansweredk) the series are violent, include nudity, a lot of humour and sarcasm, a happy ending, and in the end you will want more of his linesTo conclude, yes I definitely recommend this show...
