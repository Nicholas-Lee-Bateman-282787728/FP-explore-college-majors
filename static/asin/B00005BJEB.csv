581338,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00005BJEB,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[10, 12]","This DVD marks the final DVD of the Bubblegum Crisis 2040 series featuring TV episodes 22-24 and OAV 1-2.  What that means that in Japan, everyone who watched the TV series had to wait for the true final ending when it was released as OAV's.The storyline now has the Knightsabers kicked out of their building which was taken over by Galatea and the Boomers.  The Knightsabers find a few more people who are trapped in Tokyo.  This is the final battle between the Knightsabers and Galatea and also what happens to Mackie?  You have to watch and find out.  Also, this DVD answers the question if about Priss and Leon.Although the finale may present more questions than answers, I am guessing the creators wanted the viewer to make their own conclusions or wait until the next series or OAV's are released.As for the DVD itself, similar to the rest, looks and sounds great.  As for the final two OAV's, since it's not television, they spent a little more on the final episodes and unlike the TV series, there is nudity.  As for special features, there is the voice actress profiles but I'm not sure why not all of them are included.  Also, still can't find the ADVfilm CM's for the other anime.All in all, a great series and pretty bummed that the ride is over.

Humanoid machines called boomers have rebuilt the city and it's better than ever. Except for 1 little detail. Some of the boomers go out of control and attack people. Along with the A.D. Police, the Knight Sabers are a vigilante group that destroy the rogue boomers. What these 5 women are doing is noble, but the police don't like having their toes stepped on. Despite that, the Knight Sabers are the best equipped to deal with the problem. They don't have any idea that a sinister plot is in the works. A plot so devious, that maybe even they won't be able to save the planet.Bubblegum Crisis is really cool. The futuristic neo-punk setting is unique and the characters are awesome. This was one of the first anime I ever bought and now almost 200 series purchases later I have to say it's still a favorite. This anime is timeless.

581346,A2Y1D9287MGNQ4,B00005BJEB,Steven Myers,"[1, 2]","This is the end of BGC2040: the last five episodes on disc 6.  Galatea completes her conquest of Tokyo and sets her eyes on a bigger prize: Earth and all of humanity.  While disc 5 was rather aimless, this disc picks up the pace again.  The first episode is still a little slow, but once the battle picks up again, there are only brief interludes, which are used to good effect for character interaction.  Unlike a lot of shows, the ending doesn't rewrite the rules of the game; rather, the battle with Galatea builds on a lot of the revelations made about boomers in volumes 4 and 5.Technically, these episodes are top-notch.  The last two, in particular.  These two were not aired on Japanese TV and probably benefited by having bigger budgets.  An unfortunate side-effect is that the creators decided to throw in some nudity in the last two episodes for no reason.  It's all either long distance shots or really weird angles, so it probably wouldn't be terribly offensive to anyone, but it's rather pointless.
