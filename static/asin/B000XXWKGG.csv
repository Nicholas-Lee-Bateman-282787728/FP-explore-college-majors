Johnson ""Saja-chan""","[4, 6]","As I am lazy and my sentiments are pretty much the same as when I reviewed the first two boxsets, I pretty much c/p'd those reviews and just added necessary changes.If you love the Fullmetal Alchemist anime, this is a great box set to get. This box set comes with DVDs 8-10 of the series as well as booklets/inserts for each DVD. Each booklet contains beautiful artwork from the show, character profiles, and comments from production staff. The main box and the boxes that hold the discs and inserts are really well done; they keep everything safe and have great artwork.I noticed the product description didn't have a rating. I, personally, wouldn't recommend this for those under 13-14 years of age, but those commenting on my previous reviews felt that ages 10-12 would be alright with it. Things get violent and there are several adult topics prevalent (war, murder, politics, racism). If you are unsure about it, just watch it before you let the children do and make your own judgment call.",5,Expect the same quality as the previous boxsets.,1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,995,"['am', 'lazy', 'sentiments', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'when', 'reviewed', 'first', 'two', 'boxsets', 'pretty', 'much', 'c/p', ""'d"", 'reviews', 'just', 'added', 'necessary', 'changes.If', 'love', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'anime', 'great', 'box', 'set', 'get', 'box', 'set', 'DVDs', '8-10', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'booklets/inserts', 'DVD', 'booklet', 'beautiful', 'artwork', 'show', 'character', 'profiles', 'comments', 'production', 'staff', 'main', 'box', 'boxes', 'hold', 'discs', 'inserts', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'keep', 'everything', 'safe', 'have', 'great', 'artwork.I', 'noticed', 'product', 'description', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'rating', 'personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', '13-14', 'years', 'age', 'commenting', 'previous', 'reviews', 'felt', '10-12', 'would', 'be', 'alright', 'Things', 'get', 'violent', 'are', 'several', 'topics', 'prevalent', 'war', 'murder', 'politics', 'racism', 'are', 'unsure', 'just', 'watch', 'let', 'children', 'do', 'make', 'own', 'judgment', 'call']",N/A

If you are looking at Season 2, then you most likely already like the series and dont need my help to convince you to get this. Amazon has the best prices I have found, especially if you wait until they become one of your personal daily deals. This is an absolutely awesome series and very worth the price.",5,Outstanding anime series,1221436800,"09 15, 2008",2008,438,"['episode', 'series', 'important', 'interesting', 'watch', 'series', 'take', '10', 'episodes', 'resolve', 'conflict', 'are', 'looking', 'Season', '2', 'then', 'most', 'likely', 'already', 'series', 'dont', 'need', 'help', 'convince', 'get', 'Amazon', 'best', 'prices', 'have', 'found', 'especially', 'wait', 'become', 'one', 'personal', 'daily', 'deals', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'series', 'very', 'worth', 'price']",N/A
