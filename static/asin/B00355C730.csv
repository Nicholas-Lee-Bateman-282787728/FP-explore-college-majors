This DVD is disappointing on many fronts, the sound is uneven (too loud in spots, too soft in others), the narrative is boring and repetative, the DVD focuses too much on the later years and does not pay enough attention to the early and mid-period of the band, and not all of the members of the band are given their fair share of attention.  The only positive aspect of the DVD is that many of the older, lost performances are represented.",3,Not what it should have been.,1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,564,"['Kinks', 'were', 'one', 'best', 'groups', 'come', 'British', 'Invasion', 'laid', 'groundwork', 'many', 'types', 'music', 'DVD', 'disappointing', 'many', 'fronts', 'sound', 'uneven', 'too', 'loud', 'spots', 'too', 'soft', 'others', 'narrative', 'boring', 'repetative', 'DVD', 'too', 'much', 'later', 'years', 'not', 'pay', 'enough', 'attention', 'early', 'mid-period', 'band', 'not', 'members', 'band', 'are', 'given', 'fair', 'share', 'attention', 'only', 'positive', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'many', 'older', 'lost', 'performances', 'are', 'represented']",N/A

This is an excellent video which showcases the talent of Ray Davies , his brother Dave and the other members of this innovative group. It was a delight to watch them in concert if only for the memories of the music glory days of the 1960's and '70's.

Although there are  few complete performances here, the DVD is marred by the frequent and all too predictible overtalk by the punter who narrates the DVD, riuning the said performances. In addition to the annoyance of such narration, the people who do it usually don't know as much about the band in question as those viewing the DVD. Bottom line. Pass on this. If you want high quality Kinks performances, I'm certain you will be able to find plenty of ""alternative"" DVDs out there.Don't buy this garbage or anything like it.
