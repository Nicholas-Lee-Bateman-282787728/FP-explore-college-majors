361844,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303184138,Acute Observer,"[3, 3]","Mayerling, 1937 filmThis begins in 1883 Vienna. A band marches by. Franz Joseph receives visitors. They talk about the rioting students, inflamed by the writing of Szeps (a liberal). Szeps is a friend of Prince Rudolph. Force will be used to gain respect. Cavalry chase down people on the streets. [An echo of the disturbances in Paris?] Many are arrested and brought before the police, including Szeps. One of these is Rudolph of Hapsburg! He will marry for dynastic reason. [Such inbreeding can cause problems, as with the Tsarevich.] Two detectives watch who visit Prince Rudolph years later. Rudolph is bored at his party. The police are watching him and plan to arrest Szeps. That gypsy sings for the police too. Rudolph visits a music hall and watches dancing men. Then he sees a young woman arrive unescorted. They watch a play. Punished for love? There is a game with swans. She tells him he looks like Archduke Rudolph!Rulolph learns the police want to arrest Szeps, but he got away. Count Toofe visits and they talk. They want to protect Rudolph. Rudolph visits His Majesty, who is not receiving visitors. Everyone bows to him. ""Poor prince!"" Rudolph will attend the opera tonight. Little Vetsera is there. They watch a ballet. Rudolph watches Vetsera. [Watch their facial expressions.] Schratt is with the Emperor, like Mme. Pompadour to King Louis XV. Rudolph meets Marie Vetsera in church. He wants to see her again. A visitor brings a message to Marie. She gets advice on behavior from Countess Larisch before meeting Rudolph. [Were love affairs the pastime of the nobility?] Marie is different from the others, she wants nothing. They are watched, this romance must be ended. A letter is written about the meetings. The police watch Rudolph. Marie's mother gets that letter and rebukes her. Will she send Marie away for six weeks?Rudolph gets the news. He returns to his old life. The police continue to watch him. Music, dancing, and drinking for entertainment. He draws his revolver and shoots at an image in the mirror! Then Marie returns to see him. Rudolph is upset and angry about his life. He suffers. Marie comforts him that night. Rudolph wants a divorce and writes to Rome. The meeting with Marie causes a problem for Marie's brother George, he doesn't want her discussed by his officer friends. Rudolph puts and end to this quarrel. ""Go on with your party."" Her Majesty visits Rudolph's rooms and meets Marie. ""This is a sad place ... don't come back.""Rudolph tells brother George to call off the duel with Schomberg. Franz Joseph commands an end to this affair. ""Never!"" Then Marie will be sent to a cloistered convent! Rudolph asks for one more meeting. There is a Royal Ball. Rudolph asks Marie to follow him on a long voyage. Marie doesn't bow as the Archduchess passes by! The pair arrive at Mayerling, a hunting lodge. There is snow on the ground. Her family reports Marie is missing. It is the 30th of January, 1889. Rudolph burns letters in the fireplace. In the morning Rudolph goes to his desk. Marie sleeps when there is a shot. Later there is another shot, and Rudolph falls. Is this end the result of a love affair?The world was told that Prince Rudolph died in a hunting accident. The body of Marie was secretly removed. Was this legend of the two deaths accurate? Franz Joseph lived for another 26 years. Another Archduke died in 1914 Sarajevo. The end of WW I was followed by the dissolution of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and freedom for its many nations. ""The Mayerling Murders"" said Rudolph and Marie were killed to prevent a liberal from succeeding to the throne. Rudolph admired England and France and may not have continued the alliance with Berlin. Many who opposed Bismarck disappeared without a trace (like journalists). Political assassinations were common in Europe, such as with Alexander II in Russia.",4,The Life and Death of an Archduke,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,3858,"['Mayerling', '1937', 'filmThis', '1883', 'Vienna', 'band', 'marches', 'Franz', 'Joseph', 'visitors', 'talk', 'rioting', 'students', 'inflamed', 'writing', 'Szeps', 'liberal', 'Szeps', 'friend', 'Prince', 'Rudolph', 'Force', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'gain', 'respect', 'Cavalry', 'chase', 'down', 'people', 'streets', '[', 'echo', 'disturbances', 'Paris', ']', 'Many', 'are', 'arrested', 'brought', 'police', 'including', 'Szeps', 'One', 'Rudolph', 'Hapsburg', 'will', 'marry', 'dynastic', 'reason', '[', 'Such', 'inbreeding', 'can', 'cause', 'problems', 'Tsarevich', ']', 'Two', 'detectives', 'watch', 'who', 'visit', 'Prince', 'Rudolph', 'years', 'later', 'Rudolph', 'bored', 'party', 'police', 'are', 'watching', 'plan', 'arrest', 'Szeps', 'gypsy', 'sings', 'police', 'too', 'Rudolph', 'music', 'hall', 'watches', 'dancing', 'men', 'Then', 'young', 'woman', 'arrive', 'unescorted', 'watch', 'play', 'Punished', 'love', 'game', 'swans', 'Archduke', 'Rudolph', 'Rulolph', 'police', 'want', 'arrest', 'Szeps', 'got', 'away', 'Count', 'Toofe', 'visits', 'talk', 'want', 'protect', 'Rudolph', 'Rudolph', 'Majesty', 'who', 'not', 'receiving', 'visitors', 'Everyone', 'Poor', 'prince', 'Rudolph', 'will', 'attend', 'opera', 'tonight', 'Little', 'Vetsera', 'there', 'watch', 'ballet', 'Rudolph', 'Vetsera', '[', 'Watch', 'facial', 'expressions', ']', 'Schratt', 'Emperor', 'Mme', 'Pompadour', 'King', 'Louis', 'XV', 'Rudolph', 'Marie', 'Vetsera', 'church', 'see', 'again', 'visitor', 'message', 'Marie', 'advice', 'behavior', 'Countess', 'Larisch', 'meeting', 'Rudolph', '[', 'Were', 'affairs', 'pastime', 'nobility', ']', 'Marie', 'different', 'others', 'nothing', 'are', 'watched', 'romance', 'must', 'be', 'ended', 'letter', 'written', 'meetings', 'police', 'watch', 'Rudolph', 'Marie', 'mother', 'letter', 'Will', 'send', 'Marie', 'away', 'six', 'weeks', 'Rudolph', 'news', 'old', 'life', 'police', 'continue', 'watch', 'Music', 'dancing', 'drinking', 'entertainment', 'revolver', 'shoots', 'image', 'mirror', 'Then', 'Marie', 'returns', 'see', 'Rudolph', 'upset', 'angry', 'life', 'Marie', 'night', 'Rudolph', 'divorce', 'Rome', 'meeting', 'Marie', 'problem', 'Marie', 'brother', 'George', ""n't"", 'want', 'discussed', 'officer', 'friends', 'Rudolph', 'end', 'quarrel', 'Go', 'party', 'Majesty', 'Rudolph', 'rooms', 'meets', 'Marie', 'sad', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'Rudolph', 'brother', 'George', 'call', 'off', 'duel', 'Schomberg', 'Franz', 'Joseph', 'end', 'affair', 'Never', 'Then', 'Marie', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'cloistered', 'convent', 'Rudolph', 'one', 'more', 'meeting', 'Royal', 'Ball', 'Rudolph', 'Marie', 'follow', 'long', 'voyage', 'Marie', ""n't"", 'bow', 'Archduchess', 'passes', 'pair', 'arrive', 'Mayerling', 'hunting', 'lodge', 'snow', 'ground', 'family', 'reports', 'Marie', 'missing', '30th', 'January', '1889', 'Rudolph', 'letters', 'fireplace', 'morning', 'Rudolph', 'desk', 'Marie', 'sleeps', 'when', 'shot', 'Later', 'shot', 'Rudolph', 'falls', 'end', 'result', 'love', 'affair', 'world', 'was', 'told', 'Prince', 'Rudolph', 'died', 'hunting', 'accident', 'body', 'Marie', 'was', 'secretly', 'removed', 'Was', 'legend', 'two', 'deaths', 'accurate', 'Franz', 'Joseph', 'lived', '26', 'years', 'Archduke', 'died', '1914', 'Sarajevo', 'end', 'WW', 'was', 'followed', 'dissolution', 'Austrian-Hungarian', 'Empire', 'freedom', 'many', 'nations', 'Mayerling', 'Murders', 'said', 'Rudolph', 'Marie', 'were', 'killed', 'prevent', 'liberal', 'succeeding', 'throne', 'Rudolph', 'admired', 'England', 'France', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'continued', 'alliance', 'Berlin', 'Many', 'who', 'opposed', 'Bismarck', 'disappeared', 'trace', 'journalists', 'Political', 'assassinations', 'were', 'common', 'Europe', 'such', 'Alexander', 'II', 'Russia']",Mayerling VHS

The performances, photography, writing, and direction are absolutely first class.  But the manufacturers of the video should be ashamed of themselves for  releasing the film in this condition--the soundtrack (at least on this  print) has deteriorated horrendously---it has the worst sound of any 1930's  movie I have ever seen.Entire syllables are inaudible; the sound fades in  and out like a bad shortwave radio connection. The bad quality of the sound  has to be heard to be believed, and what's even worse, the music track seems  relatively unaffected-only the dialogue suffers. The box proudly proclaims  that the subtitles in this French film have been digitally improved. One wonders why they didn't pay more attention to the sound. I hope that there are better prints of this 1936 ""Mayerling"" (long unseen on  television-especially since the 1968 English-language remake) still around.  If not, and if that is one of the reasons it hasn't turned up on TV, then it  is one of the great tragedies of film preservation.UPDATE (2011): I have just seen part of the Criterion DVD of ""Mayerling"" online, and while the sound is far from perfect, it has been greatly improved.

361846,A1K548TDR33DMN,6303184138,Anna Shlimovich,"[3, 4]","I got particularly interested in seeing this film after a recent voyage to Vienna - not only because the Prince's mother Empress Sissi is now such a hot commodity that a whole section of Hofburg is dedicated to her as ""Sissi Museum"", a new development since my last visit to the Habsburg's stronghold 13 years ago, but also because the word Mayerling is still quite around Viennese billboards, announcement poles, and other places of attention; only that it is another movie, with Catherine Deneve, is advertised.  Yet I am pretty sure that this 1936 version easily beats modern soup opera, although it is funny to think that both films are in French!It is interesting to observe that in Anatole Litvak's movie Empress Elisabeth is played by a middle-aged actress with no apparent beauty (Gabrielle Dorziat); she is a good-looking 50+ years old lady, as befits a 52 years old mother, as Empress Elisabeth was in 1889, of the 31 years old prince.  There is nothing of a sugar-sweet-soupy character created later on and incarnated in Romy Schneider, with a cult of Sissi catching on and growing into today with much fanfare.  Here she is just an obscure empress and quite a distant mother, selfish enough- which is much more true to her historic character.Speaking of this version, Mayerling with Charles Boyer as Prince Rudolf and Danielle Darrieux as the young Baroness Vetsera, it is quite a masterpiece of cinematography.  I read with amazement the other reviewers complains about the soundtrack - for me it is one of the strongest and most powerful points of the picture.  The scene in the opera house with the music from ""Sleeping Beauty"" is so marvelously clever and suggestive of the young baroness struck by love for her Prince Charming; it is such an exquisite hint in the film towards the development of the events as a fabulous fairytale.  And on a side note, one can notice how ballet as an art form progressed from those days - today they dance infinitely better than when the film was done - in 1936.Next, we hear the opening accords  from ""Aufforderung zum Tanz"" (""Invitation to the dance"") by Carl Maria von Weber, written in 1819.  For those who are familiar with these pieces of music, it brings incredibly powerful associations - of the utmost romantic love, of a fairytale, of sublime and beauty of idealized love.  It is interesting to note that the same music was used by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in ""Le Spectre de la Rose"" ballet in 1911, based on a poem by Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, on these two lines:Je suis le spectre d'une roseQue tu portais hier au bal.And in the film the music starts when the young Baroness sees her Prince Charming, just as in the ballet the He-Rose appears in the girl's dream.  It is incredibly witty used in the film.It is difficult to believe the suicide story, in the same way as that of Ludwig II of Bavaria, or that ""accidental"" death of Princess Diana.  These mysteries are invariably politically driven, and these characters are without a doubt are victims of conspiracy.For that reason, it is difficult to read the ending as it is presented by the director;  even if we believe Rudolf committed suicide, his murder of his young lover invalidates the whole notion of love; destroying the fairytale.Should we believe that he was simply a psycho?  It is hard to accept.  Archduke Rudolph as Charles Boyer  looks somewhat sinister, deceiving and secretly scheming, very much in the same way as a treacherous  lover in Visconti's film ""Senso"" (1954), played there by another beautiful male Farley Granger, who in 1954 is as young and handsome as Charles Boyer in 1936; strangely, both play Austrians - Boyer plays Archduke Rudolf and Granger plays an Austrian Lieutenant in Venice of 1860s - not too far from archduke Rudolf's times ...Charles Boyer's ""emploi"" seems to be this kind of cold and cruel lover - as he is in extraordinary film ""Gaslight"" and a great one ""Earrings of Madame de..."" (1953), where he is incidentally co-starred by Danielle Darrieux encore.  Yet I think he is a more formidable actor, with much more unique personality on the screen than she is.What is really strange, however, that the real Charles Boyer had committed suicide two days after his wife's death.  ""Goodness, that's awkward"".Apart from musings on what was the true story at Mayerling, the movie is a gem of cinematic art, made in a manner that is not to return.Beautiful.",4,Sleeping Baroness and her Prince Charming.,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,4416,"['got', 'particularly', 'interested', 'seeing', 'film', 'recent', 'voyage', 'Vienna', 'not', 'only', 'Prince', 'mother', 'Empress', 'Sissi', 'now', 'such', 'hot', 'commodity', 'whole', 'section', 'Hofburg', 'dedicated', 'Sissi', 'Museum', 'new', 'development', 'last', 'visit', 'Habsburg', 'stronghold', '13', 'years', 'ago', 'also', 'word', 'Mayerling', 'still', 'quite', 'Viennese', 'billboards', 'announcement', 'poles', 'other', 'places', 'attention', 'only', 'movie', 'Catherine', 'Deneve', 'advertised', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', '1936', 'version', 'easily', 'modern', 'soup', 'opera', 'funny', 'think', 'films', 'are', 'French', 'interesting', 'observe', 'Anatole', 'Litvak', 'movie', 'Empress', 'Elisabeth', 'played', 'middle-aged', 'actress', 'apparent', 'beauty', 'Gabrielle', 'Dorziat', 'good-looking', '50+', 'years', 'old', 'lady', 'befits', '52', 'years', 'old', 'mother', 'Empress', 'Elisabeth', 'was', '1889', '31', 'years', 'old', 'prince', 'nothing', 'sugar-sweet-soupy', 'character', 'created', 'later', 'incarnated', 'Romy', 'Schneider', 'cult', 'Sissi', 'catching', 'growing', 'today', 'much', 'fanfare', 'Here', 'just', 'obscure', 'empress', 'quite', 'distant', 'mother', 'selfish', 'enough-', 'much', 'more', 'true', 'historic', 'character.Speaking', 'version', 'Mayerling', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'Prince', 'Rudolf', 'Danielle', 'Darrieux', 'young', 'Baroness', 'Vetsera', 'quite', 'masterpiece', 'cinematography', 'read', 'other', 'reviewers', 'complains', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'strongest', 'most', 'powerful', 'points', 'picture', 'scene', 'opera', 'house', 'music', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'so', 'marvelously', 'clever', 'suggestive', 'young', 'baroness', 'struck', 'love', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'such', 'exquisite', 'hint', 'film', 'development', 'events', 'fabulous', 'fairytale', 'side', 'note', 'one', 'can', 'notice', 'how', 'ballet', 'art', 'form', 'progressed', 'days', 'today', 'dance', 'infinitely', 'better', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'done', '1936.Next', 'hear', 'opening', 'accords', 'Aufforderung', 'zum', 'Tanz', 'Invitation', 'dance', 'Carl', 'Maria', 'von', 'Weber', 'written', '1819', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'pieces', 'music', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'associations', 'utmost', 'romantic', 'love', 'fairytale', 'sublime', 'beauty', 'idealized', 'love', 'interesting', 'note', 'same', 'music', 'was', 'used', 'Diaghilev', 'Ballets', 'Russes', 'Le', 'Spectre', 'de', 'la', 'Rose', 'ballet', '1911', 'based', 'poem', 'Th', 'eacute', 'Gautier', 'two', 'lines', 'Je', 'suis', 'le', 'spectre', ""d'une"", 'roseQue', 'tu', 'portais', 'hier', 'au', 'bal.And', 'film', 'music', 'when', 'young', 'Baroness', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'just', 'ballet', 'He-Rose', 'girl', 'dream', 'incredibly', 'witty', 'used', 'film.It', 'difficult', 'believe', 'suicide', 'story', 'same', 'way', 'Ludwig', 'II', 'Bavaria', 'accidental', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'mysteries', 'are', 'invariably', 'politically', 'driven', 'characters', 'are', 'doubt', 'are', 'victims', 'conspiracy.For', 'reason', 'difficult', 'read', 'ending', 'presented', 'director', 'even', 'believe', 'Rudolf', 'committed', 'suicide', 'murder', 'young', 'lover', 'whole', 'notion', 'love', 'destroying', 'fairytale.Should', 'believe', 'was', 'simply', 'psycho', 'hard', 'accept', 'Archduke', 'Rudolph', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'somewhat', 'sinister', 'deceiving', 'secretly', 'scheming', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'treacherous', 'lover', 'Visconti', 'film', 'Senso', '1954', 'played', 'beautiful', 'male', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'who', '1954', 'young', 'handsome', 'Charles', 'Boyer', '1936', 'strangely', 'play', 'Austrians', 'Boyer', 'Archduke', 'Rudolf', 'Granger', 'Austrian', 'Lieutenant', 'Venice', '1860s', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'archduke', 'Rudolf', 'times', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'emploi', 'be', 'kind', 'cold', 'cruel', 'lover', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'Gaslight', 'great', 'one', 'Earrings', 'Madame', 'de', '1953', 'where', 'incidentally', 'co-starred', 'Danielle', 'Darrieux', 'encore', 'think', 'more', 'formidable', 'actor', 'much', 'more', 'unique', 'personality', 'screen', 'is.What', 'really', 'strange', 'however', 'real', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'had', 'committed', 'suicide', 'two', 'days', 'wife', 'death', 'Goodness', 'awkward', '.Apart', 'musings', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'Mayerling', 'movie', 'gem', 'cinematic', 'art', 'made', 'manner', 'not', 'return.Beautiful']",Mayerling VHS

It was the film that got both Charles Boyer and Anatole Litvac, the director into Hollywood. Everything about it boasts quality from the sets, the costumes and of course the acting.Charles Boyer was 36 when he played this role.  He brings such quality and skill to his role.  The decadence of life at court, a prince with no job and nothing to do.  He had two friends whom he could trust and two servants whose loyaly was without question.  Otherwise there was nothing except drink and women. He never met anyone who didn`t want something from him.  Husbands sent their wives to him when they wanted a favour.  The corruption, spying and the uselessness of his life was more than he could bear.When he finally met the young woman who loved him for himself, his whole world changed and for a short time they were happy.  When their affair became known in the Court, the Emperor and the Prime Minister wanted it stopped.  Prince Rudolph refused which was the catalyst for the couple`s suicide.Danielle Darrieux was the seventeen year old who loved the prince.  The two stars are excellent in their roles and the whole film speaks of excellence and care.Charle Boyer went on to have a huge career in Hollywood but his first love was always the stage and he returned there whenever he felt the need for change.  His stage performances were mesmorising as he held the audiences in the palm of his hand.  Although he and his wife lived in America, they returned to France quite often and he continued to make films there for the rest of his life.I have just read his biography.  He was a method actor long before the word was invented.  Very intense, he spent most of his time, when filming, on his own, getting himself into the right frame of mind for his next scene.  He left a huge body of work behind.  He had four Oscar nominations.

Every aspect of it is superior to the other version that is available except the sound track.  The sound levels are all over the place from  moment to moment.  Whole chunks of dialogue are missing as Boyer's voice  disappears for brief moments. This is a great and outrageous distraction.  This more expensive version sounds as if it was recorded in a tin cup.  I  saw the other version, the $12.99 version, and don't remember its sound  track being as bad as it is here.  The things that bother me about that  version were the poor picture quality and the badly placed, frequently off  the screen, subtitles.

MAYERLING is a touching masterpiece; a poetically tragic romance, the kind of which seem obsolete in movies anymore. Only Boyer could have played the doomed Rudolph so expertly and with such incisive understanding: he becomes the part and gives a majestic portrayal. Darrieux is tender and electric as the sad young woman who chooses death to be with the man she loves.  The success of the film lies in its manner, not its matter.  There have been many recognition-scenes, such as the one at the ballet where Danielle Darrieux as Marie Vetsera becomes aware that the prince in the royal box is indeed the young man of yesterday's carnival!  It was a compliment on Miss Darrieux's acting to remember more scenes involving her than anyone else; her American debut was certainly promising.  This in no way detracted from Boyer's brilliant performance as the temptestuous Rudolph which, it suffices to say, is a finished job.  The completely excellent cast included Suzy Prim (!)as the comic Countess Larisch, Jean Dax as the glazed-eyed Emperor, Marthe Regnier as the conventional and unsuspecting mother and Debucourt as the implacable spy-director.
