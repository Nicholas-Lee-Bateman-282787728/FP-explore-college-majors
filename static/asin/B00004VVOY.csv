A part of the Bible Collection it tells the story of a Jewish woman named Haddassah an orphan being raised by her uncle Mordecai. He works in the palace of the Persian king Xerxes who has banished his queen Vashti for refusing to obey his command. The story is well known and I won't continue it here, but the history behind the story, and surrounding it was just very interesting for a person who love history like I do.Like almost all the movies in the Collection the time and attention paid to detail, costumes and acting is superb. I wish all TV movies were done this well. This movie is shorter than normal, about 1.5 hours, but you don't really notice it in comparision to the others. I like that it felt longer, but wasn't. They were able to put in so much information without getting bogged down with it or dragging it out.

The actress playing Esther is much prettier in the movie than on the cover of the DVD, yet she does a great job of portraying Esther as a smart, resourceful women doing her best in impossible situations.This movie is one of about a dozen Bible films that were made during the 1990's by this same company, ""Lube""-- a European production company making great films for an American audience. All the films are shot speaking English.You can save money by purchasing ""The Bible Series Box Set,"" which features Esther, plus equally good movies of JEREMIAH and SOLOMON. Esther is the most Biblically precise telling, while the other two films have to cover much larger chunks of scripture, so the producers had to move story elements around to fit a movie length, but they are all three equally enjoyable and educational for Bible lovers.Some of the other Lube movies are starting to finally come out on DVD, such as JACOB and JOSEPH, via TNT, the cable TV giant, whom I suppose purchased the DVD rights. JACOB and JOSEPH are also up to the same quality standards as ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON. I think that MOSES and ABRAHAM are also part of the Lube Productions output, but I'm not sure, since I have yet to view MOSES and ABRAHAM.

553002,A2CLCT73B5JV5F,B00004VVOY,Dora A. Smith,"[2, 4]","The Book of Esther is one of my favorite Bible stories.  It would be very hard to completely destroy it.  This version is decent.  It doesn't do as well at describing the problematic nature of harem life as some Esther movies.  This movie also doesn't adequately play up the significance of Esther's decision to dress simply, and to take no particular jewels with her when she leaves the first harem and goes to the king.  In fact, the movie has her dressed more fancily than the Bible says she dressed. Other versions have her dressed, all except to appear in the king's court, in rather plain clothing.  This sets off her beauty in a different way than rich clothing and jewelry would, and far better illustrates the strength of Esther's character.  I have seen several Esther movies recently, and as I recall, this one alone doesn't skirt the fact that the king would have slept with Esther, as he did with each concubine in turn, and Esther was not yet married to him.  Missing from most Esther movies, and from this one as well, is the element that gives the story the most power; Mordecai had specifically adopted Esther because she was beautiful, and he probably slept with her as well.  It is the manner in which Esther's strong faith protects her from being changed into a cheap whore by the continuous thread of evil in her life, that gives the Biblical story its greatest power.",3,Decent but I've not seen an Esther movie that was true to the Bible story,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,1389,"['Book', 'Esther', 'one', 'favorite', 'Bible', 'stories', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'hard', 'completely', 'destroy', 'version', 'decent', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'describing', 'problematic', 'nature', 'harem', 'life', 'Esther', 'movies', 'movie', 'also', ""n't"", 'adequately', 'play', 'up', 'significance', 'Esther', 'decision', 'dress', 'simply', 'take', 'particular', 'jewels', 'when', 'first', 'harem', 'king', 'fact', 'movie', 'dressed', 'more', 'fancily', 'Bible', 'dressed', 'Other', 'versions', 'have', 'dressed', 'appear', 'king', 'court', 'rather', 'plain', 'clothing', 'off', 'beauty', 'different', 'way', 'rich', 'clothing', 'jewelry', 'would', 'far', 'better', 'strength', 'Esther', 'character', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'Esther', 'movies', 'recently', 'recall', 'one', 'alone', ""n't"", 'skirt', 'fact', 'king', 'would', 'have', 'slept', 'Esther', 'did', 'concubine', 'turn', 'Esther', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'married', 'Missing', 'most', 'Esther', 'movies', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'element', 'story', 'most', 'power', 'Mordecai', 'had', 'specifically', 'adopted', 'Esther', 'was', 'beautiful', 'probably', 'slept', 'as', 'well', 'manner', 'Esther', 'strong', 'faith', 'being', 'changed', 'cheap', 'whore', 'continuous', 'thread', 'evil', 'life', 'Biblical', 'story', 'greatest', 'power']",The Bible - Esther

This is an interesting movie that is faithful to the biblical story with some few additions that do little to dilute the basic message and veracity of the story. The movie powerfully illustrates the deep faith that Esther, Mordecai and Ezra had in God and they maintained this faith even in the face of immense suffering and troubles.The movie is well made with great acting by British actress Louise Lombard playing Esther; F. Murray Abraham playing Mordecai, Esther's cousin and foster father; Ahasuerus playing King Xerxes, King of Persia whose empire extended from Egypt to India. The sets and costumes look authentic and there was great colour harmony. Esther comes out as a clever and brave woman who ultimately saved the Jewish people from possible extermination. This should be an inspiration to all women to see how one woman could make such a positive difference to her people.

It also helps to be reminded that satan/the evil one works to try and stop God from keeping His Covenants with His People (including those of Judah during the account of Esther), as well reminds us of the lineage of Mashiakh Ben Yosef's mother [Miriam] which may have been in those who experienced this story of ""Purim.""  Satan has always tried to ""thwart"" HaShem's Plans.Very Biblically accurate (at least very close) movie on Purim, from ""The Bible"" series films.  If you saw THIS version, you wouldn't be disappointed in the story-line.  But getting the ""One Night With The King"" version is quite disappointing due to it's liberality with the Biblical account.This ""The Bible- Esther"" film is very enjoyably accurate and rewarding!  The authentic feeling of the movie props/sets, the political issues happening at the time, the differing types of Jews at that point in history, and the power of the Gentile nations are all given time in this movie.  If it wasn't for our exception below, we'd say ""get it!""  The actors do well, and you FEEL the issues at hand. A spirituality is brought forth, just as the Spirituality you pull from the Biblical account Itself.My family loved to watching this movie.  We made it a point to watch it during Purim...though it would have been enjoyed throughout the year too.We would like to recommend adding this one too, to anybody's Biblical movie shelf.  BUT we have one exception which we'll address last herein.It's done fairly well, Biblically accurate for the most part, and conveys the same message as the Scriptures tend to in the Biblical areas it traverses.  Our family enjoyed this one, on many levels.  We'd say ""buy this one!"" as it's pretty good....but again....The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting.""  We personally don't believe that God will every approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people.  You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible.  As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth.  So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film.

This film was dazzlingly filmed in Morocco, and I particularly thought the set design, costuming and cinematography was well done.I felt the storyline was a trifle weak. For instance, it seems instantaneously that Esther wins the heart of the king; however, the film fails to show why. There isn't an ounce of passion or chemistry between the king and Esther, and aside from being a good person Esther isn't that pretty nor is there much of an explanation to her instant rise to fame. The King's portrayal doesn't make this any easier, as he does very little except issue negligent commands which while biblically true, doesn't exactly endear the viewer, and while doubtless Esther spent most of her life in a harem, very little of the dynamics of harem living are portrayed.I felt this was ok. I would've liked the king to be a more charismatic character to possibly explain why Esther loved him. I would've liked there to be more chemistry between Esther and the king.

The Bible account of Esther is always sooo horribly done and bears NO resemblance to scripture at all.  But this one surprised me.  Grab your Bible and watch it like I did.
