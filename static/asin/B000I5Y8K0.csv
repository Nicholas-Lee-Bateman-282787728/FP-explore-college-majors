I even love Reflection (although some people can't stand the deviation it takes from the Manga,  I still think it's a highly evocative and beautiful film).THE ONLY REASON I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that my copy skips several key subtitles. I've watched a fansubbed version of this, and so I know where there is missing dialog. Also, at times different characters will speak but the subtitles never update to show the new dialog, hence you miss a few key exchanges.I tested this with both versions of Trust & Betrayal...the original release and the director's cut. I found that the subtitles were slightly different for both of them, and they both had missing text.I found it to be very frustrating, especially when showing the film to people who haven't seen it before. This film is tends to be very discontinuous; the scenes jump around a lot on the timeline and many of the characters do not have a very long exposition. You're kind of thrown in to this setting of pre-Meiji Era Japan without a lot of explanation, so it can be difficult to follow for newcomers to the Kenshin story. Missing subtitles only made it more confusing.It frustrates me that the studio could be that careless. I'm going to look at exchanging the complete collection release for a different release and see if it has a better subtitle job.",4,"Film gets 5 stars, but this release has some problems",1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,1413,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'series', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', ""n't"", 'said', 'amazing', 'even', 'love', 'Reflection', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'deviation', 'Manga', 'still', 'think', 'highly', 'evocative', 'beautiful', 'film', 'ONLY', 'REASON', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'copy', 'several', 'key', 'subtitles', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'fansubbed', 'version', 'so', 'know', 'where', 'missing', 'dialog', 'Also', 'times', 'different', 'characters', 'will', 'speak', 'subtitles', 'never', 'update', 'show', 'new', 'dialog', 'hence', 'miss', 'few', 'key', 'exchanges.I', 'tested', 'versions', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'original', 'release', 'director', 'cut', 'found', 'subtitles', 'were', 'slightly', 'different', 'had', 'missing', 'text.I', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'frustrating', 'especially', 'when', 'showing', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'discontinuous', 'scenes', 'jump', 'lot', 'timeline', 'many', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'very', 'long', 'exposition', ""'re"", 'kind', 'thrown', 'setting', 'pre-Meiji', 'Era', 'Japan', 'lot', 'explanation', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'follow', 'newcomers', 'Kenshin', 'story', 'Missing', 'subtitles', 'only', 'made', 'more', 'confusing.It', 'frustrates', 'studio', 'could', 'be', 'careless', ""'m"", 'going', 'look', 'exchanging', 'complete', 'collection', 'release', 'different', 'release', 'see', 'better', 'subtitle', 'job']",N/A
1019133,AMYSV3PZLNDCS,B000I5Y8K0,Just some old guy.,"[2, 5]","Trust and Betrayal ...is a Masterpiece but I am not rating just that story. I am rating this Box Set. Reflection,yawn, another disc in the set, drags on and on and I fell asleep. Another disc..""The Movie"" was a complete waste and seems geared towards an audience that is about 7 to 12 years old.There are a total of 5 discs in this set. Trust and Betrayal....Reflection ...and The Movie. ""Trust and Betrayal"" also ""Reflection"" give you the ""Directors Cut"" version as well. All in all 3 discs plus two ""Directors Cut"" for a total of 5 discs.As for myself this set is not worth the money. If you can buy ""Trust & Betrayal"" by itself then you have the best that this set has to offer.To tell you about ""Trust & Betrayal""...there are no demons..no witches or Dragons or any bizarre animals. It is one the best stories that I have had the pleasure of watching. There are broken hearts and lessons learned the honorable and untrustowrthy with great action in between. After all it takes place in fuedal Japan so there is plenty of blood that sprays out of them like a busted fuel line under pressure....grin.I would highly recommend this one disc.",2,"Just buy ""Trust & Betrayal""",1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,1141,"['Trust', 'Betrayal', 'Masterpiece', 'am', 'not', 'rating', 'just', 'story', 'am', 'rating', 'Box', 'Set', 'Reflection', 'yawn', 'disc', 'set', 'drags', 'fell', 'asleep', 'disc..', 'Movie', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'geared', 'towards', 'audience', 'about', '7', '12', 'years', 'old.There', 'are', 'total', '5', 'discs', 'set', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', '.Reflection', 'Movie', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'also', 'Reflection', 'give', 'Directors', 'Cut', 'version', 'as', 'well', '3', 'discs', 'two', 'Directors', 'Cut', 'total', '5', 'discs.As', 'set', 'not', 'worth', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'then', 'have', 'best', 'set', 'offer.To', 'tell', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'are', 'demons..no', 'witches', 'Dragons', 'bizarre', 'animals', 'one', 'best', 'stories', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'are', 'broken', 'hearts', 'lessons', 'learned', 'honorable', 'untrustowrthy', 'great', 'action', 'place', 'fuedal', 'Japan', 'plenty', 'blood', 'busted', 'fuel', 'line', 'pressure', '.grin.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'disc']",N/A

1019135,AJ6XR403WY88M,B000I5Y8K0,"Sniff Code ""www.sniffcode.com""","[3, 3]","It's a shame that George Lucas didn't hire the writer of Samurai X to pen his most recent StarWars trilogy. As I watched this absolutely amazing movie, I couldn't help but feel that this is exactly what the backstory for Anakin Skywalker should have been.The main character of Samurai X, Kenshin, has a lot in common with Anakin. Both were sold into slavery, and both have an uncompromising idea about what justice is and how it should be carried out. But unlike Anakin, with Kenshin you believe his motivations. And you're worried about the poor guy for the same reasons that you fear him. That should have been my reaction to the man behind the Vadar mask.Samurai X begins as a bloody mess, but the horrific violence is more than just a cheap thrill for entertainment. It serves as the tragic motivation for a young Kenshin who watches his only caretakers brutally murdered. He is adopted by a mostly silent but stern swordsman who teaches him the art of the sword, attempting also to learn him the virtues of balance, before allowing him to seek out and find his vengeance. However, Kenshin breaks free before such balanced is learned and he soon finds himself becoming the tyrant that he vowed to eradicate. Sound familiar?Where StarWars got it wrong, Saamurai X gets it right and then some. Even the love the story between Kenshin and Tomoe, who he meets at the peak of his blood quest, is far more convincing than Ankakin and whats-her-name. By the time Kenshin meets Tomoe he has sustained a mysterious facial wound that refuses to heal. The Greek maxim ""the gift is in the wound"" comes to mind as Kenshin begins to understand for the first time not all of his emotion are predicated on violence.I'll stop here, lest I say too much. I borrowed this movie. Now I intend to buy it. Maybe even two copies.

The review about how only trust and betrayal was the part of the collection everyone should own made me a bit skeptical, however after watching the entire series this is just not the case.

Don't get me wrong i loved the motion picture it's just not as phenomenal as trust and betrayal or reflection. I definitely recommend the complete set this story is too amazing to go incomplete!
