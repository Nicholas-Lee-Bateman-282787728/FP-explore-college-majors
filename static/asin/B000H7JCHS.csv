Perhaps this was because Kate was one of my favorite characters and also because Tony is not (the part is played VERY well, though) and to me, Ziva is a female Tony in many ways.  I still miss Kate, but I have learned to like Ziva better over time.  I still don't think much of the addition of Jenny in the third season (not that the actress doesn't do a good job, though) but enough about the third season.  Apparently, many people did not watch this show from the beginning since they don't seem to know that Kate was killed off on purpose because Sasha Alexander (the actress playing Kate) wanted off the show.  She felt that it was taking far more of her time than she had originally anticipated.  This was well publicized at the time.  But overall, if you liked Season One, you'll like Season Two.  It's a great series, with less of the kinky sex deaths than the ""CSI"" shows and more of how the crime is solved.

The series focuses on a special team of agents who investigate various crimes under the umbrella of the Navy/Marine Corps.  Mark Harmon heads up the team as Jethro Gibbs; Sasha Alexander is Kaitlin Todd; Michael Weatherly is Tony Dinosio; Pauley Perrette is forencisc expert Abby; David McCallum is medical examiner Duckie; and Sean Murray is Magee.  Crimes range from terrorists to murders to kidnapping and gun running.  Most episodes move quickly, although there are some distractions such as the annoying music that almost always accompanies Abby's scenes; McCallum's constant trivia and storytelling have become redundant and annoying; and the constant sexual bantering between Weatherly and Alexander is overused.  While all the performances are very good, especially Perrette and McCallum, Mark Harmon's character is so unlikeable at times, you wanna punch him.

I've enjoyed the program immensely, and with the DVD releases of Seasons One and Two, I have been able to do some catching up watching the show's earlier episodes.The series follows a team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which handles crimes connected to personnel of the United States Navy and Marine Corps, ranging from murder and kidnapping to espionage and terrorism.  Created by Donald Bellisario (Quantum Leap, JAG), NCIS originally began as a two-part episode of JAG in the spring of 2003.  The program then debuted on CBS as a stand-alone series in September of that same year.Returning cast members from Season One include Mark Harmon stars as special agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, the no-nonsense leader of the NCIS team.  Gibbs' teammates include former Secret Service agent Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander), special agent and former homicide detective Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), forensics expert/goth chick Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) and Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum, best remembered as The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'s Ilya Kuryakin), a quirky medical examiner.  Rookie agent Tim McGee (Sean Murray), who was a recurring character in Season One, is now an NCIS regular.Season Two begins to deepen the show's characters, developing them and their working relationships with each other progressing from the previous season.  Bellisario gets us more involved in the characters and the program, and he does a great job of building up toward the climax of the season.  Season Two ends with a bang and serves well to set up the show's third season.This six-disc DVD set includes all 23 episodes of the second season of NCIS, plus several bonus features.  The featurettes ""Investigating Season 2"" and ""What's New in Season Two"" provide a behind-the-scenes look at making of the second season episodes.  ""The Real N.C.I.S."" goes inside the real life Naval Criminal Investigative Service featuring interviews with actual NCIS agents.  This featurettes examines the differences between the TV program and the real NCIS, but also goes into how the writers consult with the real NCIS to develop realistic storylines for the show.  Finally, Pauley Perrette takes us on a tour of the lab on the NCIS set.NCIS has quickly become one of my favorite television programs over the last year, and the DVD sets for Seasons One and Two have helped me catch up with the show's past.  I look forward to the Season Three set, due for release on April 24th.  NCIS: The Complete First Season is an absolute must-have for fans for the program, and a great introduction for newcomers to the show.",5,One of my favorite primetime programs,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,2786,"['introduction', 'NCIS', 'Naval', 'Criminal', 'Investigative', 'Service', 'came', 'last', 'spring', 'watched', 'several', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'wife', 'mother-in-law', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'program', 'immensely', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'catching', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'earlier', 'episodes.The', 'series', 'team', 'special', 'agents', 'Naval', 'Criminal', 'Investigative', 'Service', 'crimes', 'connected', 'personnel', 'United', 'States', 'Navy', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'ranging', 'murder', 'kidnapping', 'espionage', 'terrorism', 'Created', 'Donald', 'Bellisario', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'JAG', 'NCIS', 'originally', 'began', 'two-part', 'episode', 'JAG', 'spring', '2003', 'program', 'then', 'debuted', 'CBS', 'stand-alone', 'series', 'September', 'same', 'year.Returning', 'cast', 'members', 'Season', 'One', 'include', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'special', 'agent', 'Leroy', 'Jethro', 'Gibbs', 'no-nonsense', 'leader', 'NCIS', 'team', 'Gibbs', 'teammates', 'include', 'former', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'Caitlin', 'Todd', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'special', 'agent', 'former', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Tony', 'DiNozzo', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'forensics', 'expert/goth', 'chick', 'Abby', 'Sciuto', 'Pauley', 'Perrette', 'Dr.', 'Donald', 'Ducky', 'Mallard', 'David', 'McCallum', 'best', 'remembered', 'Man', 'U.N.C.L.E', 'Ilya', 'Kuryakin', 'quirky', 'medical', 'examiner', 'Rookie', 'agent', 'Tim', 'McGee', 'Sean', 'Murray', 'who', 'was', 'recurring', 'character', 'Season', 'One', 'now', 'NCIS', 'regular.Season', 'Two', 'deepen', 'show', 'characters', 'developing', 'working', 'relationships', 'other', 'progressing', 'previous', 'season', 'Bellisario', 'more', 'involved', 'characters', 'program', 'great', 'job', 'building', 'up', 'climax', 'season', 'Season', 'Two', 'bang', 'well', 'set', 'up', 'show', 'third', 'season.This', 'six-disc', 'DVD', 'set', '23', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'NCIS', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'featurettes', 'Investigating', 'Season', '2', 'What', 'New', 'Season', 'Two', 'provide', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'making', 'second', 'season', 'episodes', 'Real', 'N.C.I.S', 'real', 'life', 'Naval', 'Criminal', 'Investigative', 'Service', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'actual', 'NCIS', 'agents', 'differences', 'TV', 'program', 'real', 'NCIS', 'also', 'how', 'writers', 'consult', 'real', 'NCIS', 'develop', 'realistic', 'storylines', 'show', 'Finally', 'Pauley', 'Perrette', 'tour', 'lab', 'NCIS', 'set.NCIS', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'programs', 'last', 'year', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'have', 'helped', 'catch', 'up', 'show', 'past', 'look', 'forward', 'Season', 'Three', 'set', 'due', 'release', 'April', '24th', 'NCIS', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'absolute', 'must-have', 'fans', 'program', 'great', 'introduction', 'newcomers', 'show']",N/A

What Don Bellisario has created with this series defies genre at times.  It's either an action series with great humor (bawdy at times) or a comedy with action and mystery; all brought together by a wonderful ensemble...that gets turned over in ""Twilight"".But I digress.  What we see in Season 2 is the continued development of the characters; getting to know them a little more--seeing their quirks, and their little secrets.  We begin to see a little more of Mark Harmon's Gibbs--going beyond the coffee and his ex-wives, finding more of his backstory.  The relationship between Tony and Kate--the friendly rivalry that they have (Of course, Tony finding the picture in Florida of Kate in the wet t-shirt gets him even for his kissing the transvestite in Season 1...).  Bringing Sean Murray into the fold, and watching the subtleties as Tim McGee somehow combines his nerdiness with learning to work the field.  There's always Pauley Perrette's Abby--an absolute scream for her smarts and energy--and the great David McCallum's Ducky.  Plus, getting to meet Ducky's mother in ""The Meat Puzzle"" (Somehow, Nina Foch's line to Sasha Alexander--""Let me see your knickers""--is going to stick with me for a lot of the wrong reasons)was a treat.But the last two episodes--""SWAK"", and especially the magnificent ""Twilight""--shook the series.  ""SWAK"" sets up the possibility of mortality on the team; ""Twilight"" follows through.  The return of Rudolph Martin's unstable Mossad double agent, Ari Haswari, was always kept open through the second half of Season 1, and was brought back to the viewer's mind in ""An Eye For An Eye"".  But the death of Kate--stunning as it was--was a good precursor for setting up how Season 3 played out.If I were Bellisario and I wanted to change something in Season 2, I would have brought Jessica Steen's Paula Cassidy into play more.  The Guantanamo NCIS agent who left DiNozzo ""interested"" (All viewers at once--""WHAT WOMAN DOESN'T??!?"")should probably have seen more than one episode (""Heart Break"")--if only to watch Tony moon over her.As Season 1's finale led to the underlying tone and eventuality of Season 2, the finale of Season 2 led into how Season 3 played out.
