734625,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B000087F1Z,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 1]","You know why I love those old ""classic"" horror movies so much? Because for all their problems and limitations (mostly due to lack of budget and the primitive state of special effects at the time), those movies, the really bad ones, took themselves way too seriously. Case in point: THE SCREAMING SKULL.The plot is an old one. Widowed husband brings new wife to old home with the intention of driving her either insane or to suicide in order to gain her inheritance. The husband in this case is Eric Whitlock (played by John Hudson) who's bringing his new wife Jenny (Peggy Webber) back to the mansion he shared with Marion before her untimely demise. Untimely in that Eric didn't wait long enough to kill her before she revised her will and all he got was the house and the land, but where's the money? Luckily new wife Jenny is loaded. And she's got a history of mental illness to boot--score for Eric!Rounding out our cast are curious onlookers Reverend and Mrs. Snow--friends of Eric and Marion, now Eric and Jenny--and Mickey the gardener, played by Alex Nichol who also directed.Spending her nights alone in the mansion while Eric is ""in town"" tending to the business of their moving back into the place, Jenny is woken by a screaming late at night, which turns out to be coming from a skull she finds stashed in an armoire. Jenny tosses the skull out the window, but it finds its way back onto the porch and begins knocking loudly at the door until Jenny opens it to let it in. But when Jenny tries to explain to Eric what's happened, he insists she's simply having a reaction to the new home and a portrait of his deceased wife that reminds Jenny of her own dead mother.The audience, meanwhile, is left to wonder which of the three possibilities is really at play here. It's either Marion's ghost come back to haunt the mansion, or it's Mickey trying to scare away the new wife (Mickey and Marion grew up together and she was one of the only people the feeble-minded gardener could relate to). Or, it could be stone-faced dead-inside Eric. The whys of this last theory don't come out until close to the end, so for the most part we're led to believe Mickey the likely culprit.The only problem ... the only REAL problem the movie could have solved but didn't (you can't hold crappy effects and even worse acting against them, it was 1958) is that the movie never really makes up its mind. Yes, of course it's really Eric trying to get his hands on Jenny's money without the trouble of an actual wife hanging around, but the skull Jenny finds really does move on its own, and she's clearly haunted by a real ghost while Eric is out looking for Mickey and is nowhere near the house. So THE SCREAMING SKULL actually wants to have two protagonists at once--the murdered wife, and the sociopathic husband. In the end it just leaves the audience confused.I had originally seen this movie years ago on MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000, and it's probably one of my most-viewed episodes, so it's almost impossible to watch the regular version of the movie and not hear the jokes in your head. But believe me, if you know the jokes, just say them out loud because you'll need something to take your mind off how truly boring this movie is.And now back to that part about taking themselves too seriously. In the 50s, moviemakers used to come up with some crazy ploys to get audiences in the theaters, such as William Castle's vibrating seat device during screenings of THE TINGLER. THE SCREAMING SKULL played the same game, including a short introduction stating the climax was so frightening you might actually die, and insuring free burial to anyone who did succumb to the ""shocking horror"". Well, if super-imposed skull images growing to giant proportions over the backdrop of the scene is enough to scare you literally to death ... you've got bigger problems than bad taste in movies.THE SCREAMING SKULL is a movie with simply too many strikes against it. The story is predictable, the pacing is eternal (even at only 68 minutes, it feels like a week). The editing is choppy, the sound is off balance, and the lightning changes from shot to shot. The dialogue is ridiculous, the acting even worse, and watching John Hudson writhe around while clutching a skull to his neck and pretending it's attacking him is just embarrassing.As much as I love crappy old horror movies, THE SCREAMING SKULL doesn't even qualify as cheesy bad; it's just plain bad. If you want to revel in your lack of quality, at least have something original to bring to the table. This isn't it. And that's why it wound up on MST3k in the first place.",3,Screaming Skull,1343952000,"08 3, 2012",2012,4616,"['know', 'why', 'love', 'old', 'classic', 'horror', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'problems', 'limitations', 'mostly', 'due', 'lack', 'budget', 'primitive', 'state', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'movies', 'really', 'bad', 'ones', 'took', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'Case', 'point', 'SCREAMING', 'SKULL.The', 'plot', 'old', 'one', 'Widowed', 'husband', 'new', 'wife', 'old', 'home', 'intention', 'driving', 'insane', 'suicide', 'order', 'gain', 'inheritance', 'husband', 'case', 'Eric', 'Whitlock', 'played', 'John', 'Hudson', 'who', 'bringing', 'new', 'wife', 'Jenny', 'Peggy', 'Webber', 'back', 'mansion', 'shared', 'Marion', 'untimely', 'demise', 'Untimely', 'Eric', 'did', ""n't"", 'wait', 'long', 'enough', 'kill', 'revised', 'will', 'got', 'was', 'house', 'land', 'where', 'money', 'Luckily', 'new', 'wife', 'Jenny', 'loaded', 'got', 'history', 'mental', 'illness', 'boot', 'score', 'Eric', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'curious', 'onlookers', 'Reverend', 'Mrs', 'Snow', 'friends', 'Eric', 'Marion', 'now', 'Eric', 'Jenny', 'Mickey', 'gardener', 'played', 'Alex', 'Nichol', 'who', 'also', 'directed.Spending', 'nights', 'alone', 'mansion', 'Eric', 'town', 'tending', 'business', 'moving', 'back', 'place', 'Jenny', 'woken', 'screaming', 'late', 'night', 'out', 'be', 'coming', 'skull', 'stashed', 'armoire', 'Jenny', 'skull', 'out', 'window', 'way', 'back', 'porch', 'knocking', 'loudly', 'door', 'Jenny', 'let', 'when', 'Jenny', 'explain', 'Eric', 'what', 'happened', 'simply', 'having', 'reaction', 'new', 'home', 'portrait', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Jenny', 'own', 'dead', 'mother.The', 'audience', 'meanwhile', 'left', 'wonder', 'three', 'possibilities', 'really', 'play', 'here', 'Marion', 'ghost', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'mansion', 'Mickey', 'trying', 'scare', 'away', 'new', 'wife', 'Mickey', 'Marion', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'people', 'feeble-minded', 'gardener', 'could', 'relate', 'could', 'be', 'stone-faced', 'dead-inside', 'Eric', 'whys', 'last', 'theory', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'close', 'end', 'so', 'most', 'part', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'Mickey', 'likely', 'culprit.The', 'only', 'problem', 'only', 'REAL', 'problem', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'solved', 'did', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'crappy', 'effects', 'even', 'worse', 'acting', 'was', '1958', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'mind', 'Yes', 'course', 'really', 'Eric', 'trying', 'get', 'hands', 'Jenny', 'money', 'trouble', 'actual', 'wife', 'hanging', 'around', 'skull', 'Jenny', 'really', 'move', 'own', 'clearly', 'haunted', 'real', 'ghost', 'Eric', 'out', 'looking', 'Mickey', 'nowhere', 'house', 'THE', 'SCREAMING', 'SKULL', 'actually', 'have', 'two', 'protagonists', 'once', 'murdered', 'wife', 'sociopathic', 'husband', 'end', 'just', 'audience', 'confused.I', 'had', 'originally', 'seen', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'MYSTERY', 'SCIENCE', 'THEATRE', '3000', 'probably', 'one', 'most-viewed', 'episodes', 'almost', 'impossible', 'watch', 'regular', 'version', 'movie', 'not', 'hear', 'jokes', 'head', 'believe', 'know', 'jokes', 'just', 'say', 'out', 'loud', ""'ll"", 'need', 'something', 'take', 'mind', 'how', 'truly', 'boring', 'movie', 'is.And', 'now', 'back', 'part', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', '50s', 'moviemakers', 'used', 'come', 'up', 'crazy', 'ploys', 'get', 'audiences', 'theaters', 'such', 'William', 'Castle', 'vibrating', 'seat', 'device', 'screenings', 'THE', 'TINGLER', 'THE', 'SCREAMING', 'SKULL', 'played', 'same', 'game', 'including', 'short', 'introduction', 'stating', 'climax', 'was', 'so', 'frightening', 'might', 'actually', 'die', 'insuring', 'free', 'burial', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', 'succumb', 'shocking', 'horror', 'Well', 'super-imposed', 'skull', 'images', 'growing', 'giant', 'proportions', 'backdrop', 'scene', 'enough', 'scare', 'literally', 'death', ""'ve"", 'got', 'bigger', 'problems', 'bad', 'taste', 'movies.THE', 'SCREAMING', 'SKULL', 'movie', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'strikes', 'story', 'predictable', 'pacing', 'eternal', 'even', 'only', '68', 'minutes', 'week', 'editing', 'choppy', 'sound', 'balance', 'lightning', 'changes', 'shot', 'shot', 'dialogue', 'ridiculous', 'acting', 'even', 'worse', 'watching', 'John', 'Hudson', 'writhe', 'around', 'clutching', 'skull', 'neck', 'pretending', 'attacking', 'just', 'embarrassing.As', 'much', 'love', 'crappy', 'old', 'horror', 'movies', 'THE', 'SCREAMING', 'SKULL', ""n't"", 'even', 'qualify', 'cheesy', 'bad', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'want', 'revel', 'lack', 'quality', 'least', 'have', 'something', 'original', 'bring', 'table', ""n't"", 'why', 'wound', 'up', 'MST3k', 'first', 'place']",N/A

Smart move; he's the most interesting character in the flick. I remember being scared by the trailer and even the poster when this movie first came out, but then I was 7 years old and a good, lurid poster could scare the bejayzuss out of me. The movie is cheap, moody, and the spare unadorned settings (I should think the peacocks and the flowerpots in the greenhouse took up most of the film's budget)somehow work to create a sense of jagged paranoia, although you'd think the new bride would be a tad suspicious that her new hubby can't seem to get the electricity turned on in the dark mansion he's brought her to, and she has to manage with the light of one (!) sputtering candle by which to read her Henry James. And it's a mark of the movie's quirkiness that her bedtime reading is Henry James, and not ... well, given the era, Erskine Caldwell...however, what should at worst be a guilty pleasure and at best a treasured item in your genre DVD collection, is sabotaged by the awful quality of the print. Alpha Video are very hit and miss, for instance their ""Brain that Wouldn't Die"" and ""Killer Shrews"" are not half bad, quite crisp with good sound, whereas ""Night of the Blood Beast"" is a scratchy splotchy mess, and ""Hercules Unchained"" has great chunks of the movie missing. But if you're keen to have a copy of some rare items, AV are often acceptable given the attractive packaging and LOW prices. In the case of ""Screaming Skull"", however, they frankly have a lot of nerve charging ANYTHING for the DVD. The print is speckled and scratched throughout, in places badly damaged, it jumps and hiccups, the tonal quality is non-existent; contrast so dreadful the whites flare into a screen-bleaching nothingness while the darker tones emerge as charcoal-dark blotches making the whole thing resemble a monochrome Jackson Pollock. At the most viewable moments, the image is a dull degenerated gray. Even more egregious, if that's possible, is the sound - so muffled that our plucky heroine's dialogue is unintelligible, you have to grab at a word here and there and try to infer what she might be saying. The male voices - lower register - do survive reasonably intact. Alpha Video really should be ashamed of themselves on this one. They can't keep hiding behind ""But look how cheap!"", eventually fans will wise up and start demanding refunds. On ""Screaming Skull"" at least, AV should pay us, the eager collecting movie fan public, for taking this dreadful technical travesty off their hands. But hey, I repeat ... the movie is strangely loveable, and hopefully someone will, one day, find a cleaner print.",2,"5 stars for groovy movie, minus 10 stars for lousy DVD",1084406400,"05 13, 2004",2004,2831,"['endearing', 'odd', 'little', 'film', 'directed', 'industry', 'workhorse', 'Alex', 'Nicol', 'who', 'died', 'recently', 'grand', 'old', 'age', '85', 'who', 'gave', 'role', 'grief-struck', 'gardener', 'Mickey', 'Screaming', 'Skull', 'Smart', 'move', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'flick', 'remember', 'being', 'scared', 'trailer', 'even', 'poster', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'then', 'was', '7', 'years', 'old', 'good', 'lurid', 'poster', 'could', 'scare', 'bejayzuss', 'movie', 'cheap', 'moody', 'spare', 'unadorned', 'settings', 'should', 'think', 'peacocks', 'flowerpots', 'greenhouse', 'took', 'up', 'most', 'film', 'budget', 'somehow', 'work', 'create', 'sense', 'jagged', 'paranoia', ""'d"", 'think', 'new', 'bride', 'would', 'be', 'tad', 'suspicious', 'new', 'hubby', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'electricity', 'turned', 'dark', 'mansion', 'brought', 'manage', 'light', 'one', 'sputtering', 'candle', 'read', 'Henry', 'James', 'mark', 'movie', 'quirkiness', 'bedtime', 'reading', 'Henry', 'James', 'not', 'well', 'given', 'era', 'Erskine', 'Caldwell', 'however', 'what', 'should', 'worst', 'be', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'best', 'treasured', 'item', 'genre', 'DVD', 'collection', 'sabotaged', 'awful', 'quality', 'print', 'Alpha', 'Video', 'are', 'very', 'hit', 'miss', 'instance', 'Brain', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Die', 'Killer', 'Shrews', 'are', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'quite', 'crisp', 'good', 'sound', 'Night', 'Blood', 'Beast', 'scratchy', 'splotchy', 'mess', 'Hercules', 'Unchained', 'great', 'chunks', 'movie', 'missing', ""'re"", 'keen', 'have', 'copy', 'rare', 'items', 'AV', 'are', 'often', 'acceptable', 'given', 'attractive', 'packaging', 'LOW', 'prices', 'case', 'Screaming', 'Skull', 'however', 'frankly', 'have', 'lot', 'nerve', 'charging', 'ANYTHING', 'DVD', 'print', 'speckled', 'scratched', 'places', 'badly', 'damaged', 'hiccups', 'tonal', 'quality', 'non-existent', 'contrast', 'so', 'dreadful', 'whites', 'flare', 'screen-bleaching', 'nothingness', 'darker', 'charcoal-dark', 'blotches', 'making', 'whole', 'thing', 'resemble', 'monochrome', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'most', 'viewable', 'moments', 'image', 'dull', 'degenerated', 'gray', 'Even', 'more', 'egregious', 'possible', 'sound', 'so', 'muffled', 'plucky', 'heroine', 'dialogue', 'unintelligible', 'have', 'grab', 'word', 'here', 'there', 'try', 'infer', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'saying', 'male', 'voices', 'lower', 'register', 'do', 'survive', 'reasonably', 'intact', 'Alpha', 'Video', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'hiding', 'look', 'how', 'cheap', 'eventually', 'fans', 'will', 'wise', 'up', 'start', 'demanding', 'refunds', 'Screaming', 'Skull', 'least', 'AV', 'should', 'pay', 'eager', 'collecting', 'movie', 'fan', 'public', 'taking', 'dreadful', 'technical', 'travesty', 'hands', 'hey', 'repeat', 'movie', 'strangely', 'loveable', 'hopefully', 'someone', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'cleaner', 'print']",N/A

Bernabo,"[2, 2]","""The Screaming Skull,"" comes with a guarantee that if the movie has the unintended consequence of scaring you to death, you get a free burial. That promise is a lot more interesting than the movie itself, which was actor Alex Nicol's first directing credit (he plays Mickey). Of course this film was given the ""MST3K"" treatment during Season 9, but the Don, Servo and the gang are not around to help you make it through this boring little horror film.Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) and his wife Jenni (Peggy Webber) move into a house where something not very nice happened once upon a time, namely Eric's first wife Marian died. Creepy Mickey the gardener is hanging around and when creepy things start happening involving a skull the Whitlocks think Mickey is responsible. The problem is that (a) not of the creepy things are scary and (b) Mickey does not have enough brains left to be doing anything to anybody. But Jenni has a ""nervous condition,"" which allows her to be creeped out quite easily, especially when the local reverend decides that describing Marian's gruesome death is appropriate dinner conversation. Meanwhile, Mickey is clearly more upset over Marian's death than Eric, so we are suspicious, but since Webber's performance as Jenni is so inept we do not care.This movie is 68-minutes long and I am here to tell you that Nicol's had to really drag it out to make it that long, which is not a good move. The appearance of the skull itself does not help matters and the ""special effects"" are too stupid to even get credit for being hokey. There was some notion of psychology being involved here as a fourth-rate takeoff of ""Rebecca,"" but I think that gets thrown away at the end simply so Nicol can think he has surprised his audience with the finale.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[8, 8]","Eric and Jenni Whitlock are newlyweds, moving into the home that Eric shared with his recently deceased wife Mary.  Jenni has issues that stem from seeing her parents drown, but I suspicion that Jenni has a lot more issues than just that.  After all, who else saw the bouncing skull?Jenni (and we) get to see the skull in various places on the property.  We also get to see other eerie things happening, all supposedly caused by deceased wife Mary.  However, if you pay attention and use a little deductive reasoning, you can figure out much of what is going on long before the movie reveals what is happening - except for the supernatural parts, of course.I thought the director plotted this movie well.  The plot is borrowed from other films that rely less on the supernatural aspects of the plot, but this film also uses those supernatural aspects to create an ending that varies from other, similar films.  I am unable to point to a place in the movie where I was frightened, but there are a couple of scenes that I thought were a little spooky.The picture and sound were reasonably good, though I am unable to tell whether they have been restored using the best available modern standards.  I suspect not.This movie tries very hard to take itself seriously, and other than the campy beginning (if you are frightened to death by the movie they have a coffin reserved for you) the movie is played as a reasonably straightforward horror story.  If you like movies that use a supposedly haunted house and combine supernatural and natural aspects in the plot, then you may enjoy this movie.

It's rather spooky and quite effective. The story concerns a husband bringing his new bride home to his family estate. She's recently out of a mental hospital due to the shock of her parents' accidental drownings. He's a widower and the shadow of his former wife {whom he's killed) hangs over everything. The bride (Peggy Webber, later a ""Dragnet"" regular on TV) is now rich from her inheritance and the husband tries to drive her insane and/or to suicide to get the money. He plants a skull everywhere trying to scare her and the screeching of his late wife's peacocks that still roam the grounds of the estate add to the spookiness. The screeching of the peacocks is used to emulate screams that Webber thinks is the skull screaming. But the estates' looney gardner (who loved the late wife) is on to everything and has a skull of his own that he keeps hidden in a murky fountain. Just as Webber has screamed herself into a near catatonic state from fright, the ghost of the late wife shows up to exact revenge. This sequence is handled very well as the specter is dressed in a flowing gardening dress and big hat with a skull for a face. It floats out of the greenhouse (her favorite place as she loved flowers) and chases Webber down the garden path and into the house---at night of course and very effective. It's all very low budget but well done in b&w with creepy music and a good performance from Webber. The estate is properly run down and gothic looking and shadows are used to good effect.

Turns out that's just about the best part. Newlyweds return home to the creepy empty mansion driving a gull-wing mercedes (one of the highpoints of this movie). Very subtle foreshadowing on his lack of funds. Creepy pastor and his wife show up and fawn all over the new wife. Dead first wife in the pond. Creepy portrait, creepy gardener...the wife is bingo from her parent's accident and she reads Henry James to put herself to sleep. She gonna die!! Effective scary point in the middle, laughable ""Bride of the Monster"" quality special effect of the skull attacking the husband...in the pond even! Only 68 minutes long so it will serve as a great Halloween movie for my attention-span impared children.

Nothing really creative as far as scares or special effects - just the same plastic skull rolling around on the floor over and over.  It probably would have played better as a 1/2 hour episode of Night Gallery.  For reference purposes on 50's horror, I prefer House on Haunted Hill or Tingler to this film. Screaming Skull is not bad, just uneventful with a lack of real scares or creativity.One thing to note on the Good Times version - it has a decent transfer, the sound has a hiss and crackle and there is a GoodTimes 'GT' logo that stays in the bottom corner of the screen the entire picture.
