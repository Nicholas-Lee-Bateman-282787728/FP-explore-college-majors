In essence, this is a solid story with a splendid cast.The story revolves around its title character, Kitt (Abigail Breslin), a plucky eleven-year-old who deals with peer pressure, drastic changes in her life-style, rejection, etc., etc.The movie flows well and has a relatively plausible story-line, which at times prompts audible laughter from the audience.  There is a serious side,too, including threats (laughable though they may be) against the children and a visit to a hobo ""jungle,"" or camp.  I appreciated how they portrayed the hoboes as honest people who were down on their luck.  Kitt puts it quite well.The movie is full of talented young actors and actresses - Max Thieriot, from Nancy Drew and Zach Mills, from Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium; as well as pleasantly familiar faces such as Julia Ormond and Chris O'Donnell.

Smythe,"[1, 1]","If you're going to make an innocent film or a ""family"" film, this is how you do it.The film is enjoyable and never mean-spirited *except where the plot calls for it*.  The whole sassy/smarmy thing is old; Hollywood needs to get over it.This film is full of real characters -- as real as they can be in a period piece -- who are *genuinely* kind and helpful with each other.  It harks back to the Disney films and more innocent stories of decades past, and earns nearly every emotional moment it presents.One of the more enjoyable film experiences I've had in a while.  The performances are very good.  The set-up and situation provide for a fun home environment (with numerous guests) in which some serious issues are portrayed in a light but realistic manner.  The actors look like they're *actually having fun* doing this, and every one of them gives dignity to her/his role in a way that shows why they're the names we know, from Chris O'Donnell to Joan Cusack to Stanley Tucci to many others.  Cusack has a monologue at the end that had me punching the chair with laughter; it's the kind of humor kids will enjoy, too.  It's inimitable Cusack.Nice to see something innocent and genuine for a change, with well-intentioned characters.  Recommended.P.S.

1109300,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000WGVEAC,Chris Pandolfi,"[61, 66]","""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl"" is certainly heartwarming and innocent, but that doesn't mean it's shallow and cloying. I admit that I thought it would be, mostly because I was expecting a virtual clone of last year's awful ""Nancy Drew."" There are certain similarities: both feature plucky young girls who do a lot of investigating; both have an assortment of colorful side characters; both are based on a series of stories, both feature Max Theroit. Unlike ""Nancy Drew,"" however, ""Kit Kittredge"" aims to tell a good story with real subtexts; taking place at the height of the Great Depression, we meet characters that are downtrodden and desperate, not only because their financial situations are bleak, but also because they face the scorn and rejection of ignorant people. This adaptation of stories drawn from the ""American Girl"" doll line mixes childish zeal with some very mature themes, and that alone made it worth seeing.Abigail Breslin brings enthusiasm, charm, and heart to the title character, a ten-year-old girl from Cincinnati, Ohio who runs a tree house club and dreams of becoming a newspaper reporter. She wants to write stories with fresh angles so that she can finally get into print. A pair of hobos--a helpful teenager named Will (Max Theroit) and his young friend, Countee (Willow Smith)--inspire Kit to write an article on hobo life. The fresh angle is that it will be told entirely from a kid's perspective, which may be needed in this case since many adults feel hobos are good-for-nothing leeches that suck the government dry. Kit has heard this rhetoric from her neighbors and classmates--one especially snotty young boy says that selling eggs and wearing dresses made of chicken feed bags bring you one step closer to the poorhouse.But Kit is beginning to understand the hobos' plight, not only because many of her neighbors have lost their homes to foreclosures, but also because her unemployed father (Chris O'Donnell) is forced to find work all the way in Chicago. Hoping to make ends meet, Kit's mother (Julia Ormond) turns their home into a boarding house. This is how we meet: Ms. Dooley (Jane Krakowski), a husband-seeking dance instructor; the disapproving Mrs. Howard (Glenne Headly) and her young son, Sterling (Zach Mills); Ms. Bond (Joan Cusack), a slightly goofball mobile librarian; and Jefferson Burke (Stanley Tucci), a magician. When the subject of hobo robberies comes up, Mrs. Kittredge has everyone put their valuables in her lockbox. When it's stolen, everyone suspects Will as the culprit, including the police. Kit takes it upon herself to investigate. Despite what the evidence suggests, she believes her hobo friend is innocent.It fairly obvious that ""Kit Kittredge"" is a commentary on prejudice; at one point in the film, Kit tells a cantankerous newspaper editor (Wallace Shawn) that there are good hobos and there are bad hobos, much like good apples and bad apples. She then gets a hard lesson in office politics when it's revealed that newspapers print only what the public wants to read, and the unfortunate truth is that the public is intolerant of hobos. Naturally, those who say this haven't met the people living in a hobo jungle, as Kit has; they're some of the nicest people around, and they willingly let Kit photograph them and write about them for her article. Messages of acceptance and understanding are not new, certainly not for a family film. But unlike a lot of other such stories, ""Kit Kittredge"" doesn't condescend, and when we leave, we feel both entertained and emotionally rejuvenated.Aside from Kit, one of the film's best characters is Sterling, who at such a young age has already been beaten down by life. Sterling's father, much like Kit's, also left Cincinnati to find work, and communication with his family has steadily decreased. You see nothing but hurt and sadness in this boy's eyes. He and Kit are practically in the same boat, which is why they form a special bond. Kit is now worried that her father will forget her and her mother completely, even after promising to write them every single week. I remember a scene when Kit types a letter to her father; the frustration and fear she pours into the first draft makes for a heartbreaking moment.I can't guarantee that adults will be as receptive to ""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl"" as kids will, but I definitely recommend they give it a chance. The doll may be a hollow piece of plastic, but the character is something else entirely--she's kind, spirited, intelligent, and just plain wonderful. Some may criticize the film for being too sentimental, and indeed, it's light-hearted and optimistic, more than would be expected from a story set during the Depression. But it's more mature than it lets on. Even with a childish sense of humor, hopelessness and grief are not spared on the audience. It's always a pleasure to see a family film that was made with all audiences in mind, not just kids. ""Kit Kittredge"" is such a film, one of the most enjoyable I've seen all summer.",4,The Kid Stays in Print,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,5023,"['Kit', 'Kittredge', 'American', 'Girl', 'certainly',

I was very surprised at how this movie was not doll like. It will appeal to a very wide audience.The view of the depression, yes it's very whitewashed. Perfectly in focus. Sunny. Beautiful homes. And even the hobo camp is well organized. But there was some real insight into the depression here. It takes a young person's view of what happened around them at that time. I think it speaks to a young pre-teen to teen audience about the difficulties people may have faced. Let's just say, my 13 year old son and I enjoyed this film very much. And he's a very hard sell.There's some fun in here, Stanley Tucci, Joan Cusak (School of Rock), Jane Krakowski (from Ally McBeal / 30 Rock), Wallace Shawn (120 different movies, but well known as Rex in Toy Story, and Gilbert in the Incredibles), and Colin Mochrie (from The Drew Carey Show, and Whose Line Is It Anyway). Abigail Breslin (Air Buddies and Nim's Island) did a very nice job - a tiny bit of overacting, but hey she's only 12 years old. I mention the cast and where they come from with the intention that adults and maybe boys might be more drawn into this film.Yes of course there's It's a Wonderful Life in here. But the finest message of this film, even if you don't have much, helping others is a wonderful thing. Kit's mother gave of herself even when they had little. That was an amazing thing to watch.Yes I enjoyed this film. It's some fine family entertainment that hits a sweet spot from about 10 to 14 or 15.

Movie critics and reviewers had said it was excellent. It was! It was a wonderful period movie that will bear watching again and again. My wife said it was a story for children, and I suppose that's true, but it's much, much more. The movie is set in 1934, the heart of the Great Depression. Well, I was born about that time and I don't remember much before 1940, but the folks and our relatives always had a lot of tales of those days and, for us, much of the 40s were not all that different .The movie is just wonderfully done. All the 30s and earlier cars on the streets were just amazing. The wonderful neighborhood scenes seemed so authentic. The people and their acting and appearance all appeared completely authentic. The 30s music was completely appropriate. Everything seemed so authentic and believable that you might simply relax and be transported back to relive that era. The period depiction, in itself, should bring an Oscar nomination.The acting was excellent. All of the characters seemed believable and fit the 30s scene ideally. The kids, in particular, were outstanding for depicting kids of that era. Surely, the director will receive an Oscar nomination. A little story of Kit Kitterage serving as a writer and amateur detective kept the interest and might be the highlight of the movie for children. For me, the whole movie was achingly sad and painful. I felt so sorry for the people caught up in the ever increasing economic blight and I wondered if we might not be sliding into another such situation.Abigail Breslin was particularly outstanding. I fell in love with her in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and her role in this movie was just as good, if not better. This young lady is a rising star, without question. She should get an Oscar nomination for this performance. But, of course, she had such an excellent supporting cast and that really made her stand out.This is an outstanding movie from a variety of viewpoints.

Alphs,"[20, 23]","Kit Kitteridge: An American Girl is based on the best selling American Girl Kit Books authored by Valerie Tripp.Kit's story begins in the 1930's during the Great Depression. Kit's father, Mr. Kitteridge, owns a car dealership. Her mother, Margaret is the director of the Ladies Garden Club. Kit's brother Charlie, is serving in the CCC, created by President Roosevelt. Kit aspires to become a newspaper reporter and to one day see herself in print with the Cinncinati Register. However due to the events of the Great Depression, Kit and her family's world is turned upside down. Mr. Kitteridge becomes unemployed after the bank forecloses on his car dealership. Due to the umployment situation in Cinncinati he travels to Chicago looking for work. Margaret Kitteridge along with Kit take on the responsibility of turning their large home into a boarding house. The boarders are an eclectic mix of individuals from different backgrounds. Stirling Howard, a classmate of Kit's and his mother Mrs.Howard, Miss Dooley, a dance instructor, Miss Bond, the local mobile librarian who can only stop the mobile library if she runs into something, Jefferson Berk, a magician who has a mystery of his own, and Fredrich, the boarder whose pet monkey is always keeping everyone on their toes. Kit and her mother also befriend Will and County, two young hobos who come to the Kitteridge home looking for work and a sense of family. Of course an American Girl story would not be complete without some excitement which comes in the form of a mystery for Kit and her friends to solve. This movie features a wonderful cast of character actors: Abigal Breslin as Kit, Chris O'Donnell as Mr. Kittredge, Julia Ormond as Margaret Kittredge, Jane Krakowski as Miss Dooley, Max Thieriot as Will Shepherd, Glenne Headley as Mrs. Howard, Joan Cusack as Miss Bond and Stanely Tucci as Jefferson Berk.",5,Oh We Ain't Got A Barrel of Money,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,1873,"['Kit', 'Kitteridge', 'American', 'Girl', 'based', 'best', 'selling', 'American', 'Girl', 'Kit', 'Books', 'authored', 'Valerie', 'Tripp.Kit', 'story', '1930', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Kit', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Kitteridge', 'car', 'dealership', 'mother', 'Margaret', 'director', 'Ladies', 'Garden', 'Club', 'Kit', 'brother', 'Charlie', 'serving', 'CCC', 'created', 'President', 'Roosevelt', 'Kit', 'become', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'one', 'day', 'see', 'print', 'Cinncinati', 'Register', 'However', 'due', 'events', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Kit', 'family', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'Mr.', 'Kitteridge', 'unemployed', 'bank', 'car', 'dealership', 'Due', 'umployment', 'situation', 'Cinncinati', 'Chicago', 'looking', 'work', 'Margaret', 'Kitteridge', 'Kit', 'take', 'responsibility', 'turning', 'large', 'home', 'boarding', 'house', 'boarders', 'are', 'eclectic', 'mix', 'individuals', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'Stirling', 'Howard', 'classmate', 'Kit', 'mother', 'Mrs.Howard', 'Miss', 'Dooley', 'dance', 'instructor', 'Miss', 'Bond', 'local', 'mobile', 'librarian', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'stop', 'mobile', 'library', 'something', 'Jefferson', 'Berk', 'magician', 'who', 'mystery', 'own', 'Fredrich', 'boarder', 'pet', 'monkey', 'always', 'keeping', 'everyone', 'toes', 'Kit', 'mother', 'also', 'befriend', 'Will', 'County', 'two', 'young', 'hobos', 'who', 'come', 'Kitteridge', 'home', 'looking', 'work', 'sense', 'family', 'course', 'American', 'Girl', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'excitement', 'form', 'mystery', 'Kit', 'friends', 'solve', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'character', 'actors', 'Abigal', 'Breslin', 'Kit', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Mr.', 'Kittredge', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Margaret', 'Kittredge', 'Jane', 'Krakowski', 'Miss', 'Dooley', 'Max', 'Thieriot', 'Will', 'Shepherd', 'Glenne', 'Headley', 'Mrs.', 'Howard', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Miss', 'Bond', 'Stanely', 'Tucci', 'Jefferson', 'Berk']",Kit Kittredge: An American Girl

Then, after about a half-hour or so, everything went awry, and I got too large a dosage of heavy-handed screenplay and direction. Let me hasten to say, however, that any shortcomings are not the fault of little Abigail Breslin, who is wonderful in the title role. Chris O'Donnell, who plays her father, is quite believable too, as is a nicely understated Max Thieriot in the role of young hobo Will Shepherd. On the debit side, Joan Cusack overacts by a wide margin as mobile librarian Miss Bond, and so does Wallace Shawn as newspaper editor Mr. Gibson. I suppose the main weakness, as so often happens in the motion picture industry, is the shallow script. It is way too manipulative and predictable. I could guess most all that might happen, with everything being tied up in a nice, comfy package by the final iris. Nope, that is not life, and it is also not effective storytelling. The ""bad guys"" are portrayed as buffoons, simply comic relief (complete with cartoonish music), and of course the downtrodden folks in the hobo community come little short of sainthood, one and all.

Kit (Abigail Breslin,Little Miss Sunshine) is a 10-year-old aspiring reporter living in Cincinnati with her parents (Julia Ormond and Chris O'Donnell); her father Jack owns a car dealership, and her brother Charlie is away at college. As the movie opens, we see unfortunate neighbors with foreclosure signs in their yards, belongings being seized, and soup kitchens. Kit's situation goes from comfortable to pinched overnight; the bank seizes the dealership, her father moves to Chicago to look for work, and her mother must take in boarders to make ends meet.  From there, it's only a short step to selling eggs, and then the poorhouse.Kit's generally optimistic outlook is nearly crushed under this avalanche of adult responsibilities, but her father gently tells her not to let it beat her before he leaves to look for work. Kit throws herself into her writing, penning a kid's eye view of the Depression as she volunteers at soup kitchens and befriends two young hobos, Will and Countee (Max Thieriot, who played Nancy Drew's boyfriend inNancy Drew, and Willow Smith). Kit's dreams of being a writer are nearly stamped out by the unpleasant editor Mr. Gibson (Wallace Shawn ofThe Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition)fame), but she keeps at it in an effort to make sense of the suddenly senseless world around her. The new boarders are the subject of many of her articles. There's magician Mr. Berk (Stanley Tucci), mobile librarian Ms. Bond (Joan Cusack), Mrs. Howard and her son Stirling, and the exotic dance instructor Miss Dooley.But danger strikes  as a series of robberies perpetrated by hobos sweeps the nation, and Will and Countee find themselves unwelcome, especially after Will is implicated in two robberies that hit close to home. Kit and her friends Ruthie and Stirling set out to solve the mystery of who would frame Will.The film does a wonderful job at capturing 1930s atmosphere, particularly in the soundtrack department.Kit Kittredge: An American Girl - Original Motion Picture Soundtrackcontains two fabulous tracks by the Puppini Sisters (retro 1940s-style vocal harmonies), Ain't We Got Fun by retro songbird Renee Olstead, and vintage tracks by Spike Jones, Billie Holiday, Cliff Edwards, and Xavier Cugat.Kit Kittredge is that rare movie that the whole family can enjoy together.  The story (and I haven't read the book series that it's based on) is a gently old-fashioned tale of respect, altruism, and optimism in the face of difficulty that will resonate with parents, and kids will enjoy the blend of magic shows, funny characters, and mystery.

The American Girl series is a wholesome series, featuring girls from different walks of life and backgrounds who face challenges and overcome them using ther brains, their friendships and common sense.I felt Kit Kittredge wasn't my favorite story and was actually a bit boring. Kit and her friends were nice, but lacked that spark that made them loveable (Like Samantha) and were a bit wooden. This was the Depression, and yet, Kit and her mother were fairly well off. They could've done a bit more to illustrate how hard times were for this family specifically. True, they took in boarders, but overall they were better off and better groomed than most.The subplot involving the robbery was a bit silly and the hobos.. Eh. Took up most of the story. Children might enjoy Kit Kittredge, but I found the acting a bit wooden, and the hobo's and their story overwhelmed Kit's a bit, there just wasn't spark in this story to capture my interest.",2,Kinda Boring,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,1060,"['Kit', 'Kittredge', 'American', 'girl', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'reporter', 'growing', 'up', 'depression', 'American', 'Girl', 'series', 'wholesome', 'series', 'featuring', 'girls', 'different', 'walks', 'life', 'backgrounds', 'who', 'face', 'challenges', 'overcome', 'using', 'ther', 'brains', 'friendships', 'common', 'sense.I', 'felt', 'Kit', 'Kittredge', 'was', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'bit', 'boring', 'Kit', 'friends', 'were', 'nice', 'lacked', 'spark', 'made', 'loveable', 'Samantha', 'were', 'bit', 'wooden', 'was', 'Depression', 'yet', 'Kit', 'mother', 'were', 'fairly', 'well', 'off', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'bit', 'more', 'illustrate', 'how', 'hard', 'times', 'were', 'family', 'specifically', 'True', 'took', 'boarders', 'overall', 'were', 'better', 'off', 'better', 'groomed', 'most.The', 'subplot', 'involving', 'robbery', 'was', 'bit', 'silly', 'hobos..', 'Eh', 'Took', 'up', 'most', 'story', 'Children', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Kit', 'Kittredge', 'found', 'acting', 'bit', 'wooden', 'hobo', 'story', 'overwhelmed', 'Kit', 'bit', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'spark', 'story', 'capture', 'interest']",Kit Kittredge: An American Girl

Abigail Breslin nails a performance that carries the movie, and the look and feel of the movie evokes the time period well. As such, this will most likely get multiple viewings in your house and it's just marginally worth purchasing.The theatrical aspect ratio of this movie was 1.85:1 and this release has the picture cropped down to a widescreen-TV-matching aspect ratio of 1.78:1. While that only represents less than a 4% loss of picture composition (unless it was open-matted to gain extra height from the original negative), I'd prefer it if movie studios didn't modify the composition of their movies on Blu-ray or DVD.Even though there are trailers for other American Girl movies, there is no trailer for the movie on the disc. I wish that more studios would do this, as it provides a way to see how the movie was marketed at the time and it's something that should be easy to include.Normally, I'd like to see more extras on a disc to make it worth purchasing. Such extras reward those who choose to purchase instead of rent and it allows them to get more enjoyment from the title that goes past just watching the movie.If you can get it at a good price, this DVD is worth purchasing if you have an American Girl fan in your house.",3,"Good movie, but basic DVD with few extras",1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,1386,"['good', 'movie', 'families', 'have', 'young', 'girl', 'family', 'American', 'Girl', 'series', 'will', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'performance', 'movie', 'look', 'feel', 'movie', 'time', 'period', 'well', 'such', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'get', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'house', 'just', 'marginally', 'worth', 'purchasing.The', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'movie', 'was', '1.85:1', 'release', 'picture', 'cropped', 'down', 'widescreen-TV-matching', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.78:1', 'only', 'less', '4', '%', 'loss', 'picture', 'composition', 'was', 'open-matted', 'gain', 'extra', 'height', 'original', 'negative', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'movie', 'studios', 'did', ""n't"", 'modify', 'composition', 'movies', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD.Even', 'are', 'trailers', 'other', 'American', 'Girl', 'movies', 'trailer', 'movie', 'disc', 'wish', 'more', 'studios', 'would', 'do', 'way', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'marketed', 'time', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'easy', 'include.Normally', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'more', 'extras', 'disc', 'make', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'Such', 'extras', 'reward', 'who', 'choose', 'purchase', 'instead', 'rent', 'get', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'title', 'past', 'just', 'watching', 'movie.If', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'price', 'DVD', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'have', 'American', 'Girl', 'fan', 'house']",Kit Kittredge: An American Girl
