643736,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00005JOXR,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 0]","""Evening Shade,"" a CBS-TV series that ran from 1990-94, holds a special place in the Burt Reynolds canon... Reynolds acted prodigiously on TV and in film throughout the 1960s, '70s and '80s, but this was one of his best and longest-lived roles, playing Wood Newton, a retired NFL player who has become a high school football coach for a perpetually losing small town team. The show was a half-hour sit-com dramedy with a high-powered cast that also included Ossie Davis, Hal Holbrook and Marilu Henner -- Reynolds directed almost half the episodes, but one of the show's strengths was how well he shared the spotlight. Reynolds is unhurried and relaxed, a mature actor in a mature, middle-aged role.  The show's rhythms are familiar: in its cosmopolitan-professional-settling-in-a-small-town premise, it strongly recalls the second Bob Newhart show, including the large cast of wacky locals; there is also a domestic aspect of the show that recalls shows like ""Family Ties,"" et al., but with an occasionally adult, raunchy edge (in the pilot episode, for example, Coach finds out that his late-in-life vasectomy failed, and that he and Marilu are now expecting another child) While the show conformed to some of the formulas of network TV, it also had its own unique tone and charms.  Fans will be happy to see Season One out on DVD; newcomers may be charmed as well.

As a rule these shows are usually a disaster but Evening Shade was beautifully written with a supporting cast to die for. Produced by Linda Bloodworth Thomason at the height of her Designing Women success.The show focuses on Wood Newton (Reynolds), a former pro football player who has returned to his home town of Evening Shade, Arkansas to be the town's high school football coach and his wife Ada (Henner), a lawyer who becomes the town's DA.  The following cast of supporting characters round out the show:Herman Stiles (Michael Jeter)- Wood's assistant coachFrida Evans (Elizabeth Ashley) - Ada's free thinking sisterPonder Blue (Ossie Davis) - The owner of the local bar and grillEvan Evans (Hal Holbrook) - Ada's fatherMerleen Eldridge (Ann Wedgeworth) - Evan's younger girlfriendDr. Harlan Elldridge (Charles Durning) - The town doctorBurt Reynolds received an Emmy Award fot this season - his only career Emmy.  Plus Charles Durning, Michael Jeter and Elizabeth Ashley receive nominations for this season.This show brought together some of the finest actors from Broadway including five Tony Award winners.Michael Jeter was fresh off his emotional Tony Award win for Grand Hotel and this show made him a star. He won the Emmy for the second season.Charles Durning also was fresh off his Tony win but he had been a major character actor in all mediums for the last twenty years. He received two Oscar nominations in 1982 & 1983. And prior to the show, received 4 Emmy nominations.Ashley had been a confirmed Broadway star since her 1975 Tony Award win.Ann Wedgeworth also received a Tony Award for Neil Simon's Chapter Two.And And of course Holbrook (Tony winner in 1966) has been working in all mediums for longer - including working with his wife, Dixie Carter, on Designing Women.Ossie Davis was a two time Tony award winner with over 30 years on Broadway, Films and Television when he joined this show.

They return home from the big city with their growing family. They are surrounded by talent and laughs with this cast.Hal Holbook played Evan Evans, a newspaper owner in a small town. His feisty sister, Frieda, is perfectly played by the wonderful Elizabeth Ashley. Michael Jeter played the assistant coach. Ossie Davis played the restaurant owner. Charles Durning played the mayor and Ann Wedgeworth played his wife. Despite some silliness, the cast is simply wonderful, first rate, perfectly casted to dispel stereotypes about Arkansas.The series had a nice run but it could have lasted years with the talent on it's show. Reynolds and Jeter earned Emmy awards. There were plenty of Emmy nominations in the supporting actor and actress categories for the cast as well. They don't make shows like this anymore.
