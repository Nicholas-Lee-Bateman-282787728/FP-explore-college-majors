777236,A31T9I6KLDTYZC,B0000D9PNS,Dr Lawrence Hauser,"[9, 18]","Based loosely on Arthur Schnitzler's text ""Reigen/Liebelei,"" Love In The Time Of Money depicts a human concatenation of sexual liaison between individuals who hardly know each other and could care less. And to what end? I, for one, could hardly decipher a reason for this exercise in existential malaise and gratuitous fornication. Despite the film's auspicious provenance (it credits Robert Redford as an executive producer and Sundance Institute as a progenitor), a cast of talented actors, and a moment or two of artistically consequential cinematography, I was thoroughly disappointed by what impressed me as a pointlessly languid depiction of desultory sex engaged in by aimless, unhappy people. Remarkably, Peter Mattei's direction and script were so poorly realized that even an inspired and almost always entertaining actress like Jill Hennessy turned in a performance that fell flat on its face in several early scenes of this woefully misguided project. Her painful, uncharacteristically self-conscious portrayal of an affection-starved wife on the prowl was, in fact, so stilted and motivationally confused that I was actually embarrassed for her as I forced myself to watch! There were, however, a few moments in the middle of the picture when I thought (hoped) that something of interest was germinating on the screen. As, for example, when Steve Buscemi in the role of an aspiring painter attempts to get Rosario Dawson, playing a secretary employed by the art gallery where he intends to show his canvases, to model for him. But once the tension in this duet of awkward seduction quickly and inevitably devolves into meaningless sex I was sadly reminded once again of how Mattei's vision of alienated 'love' refused to get out of its own way for even a minute's respite. ...I submit these comments as a service to those who are contemplating what I was unable to avoid.",2,A Narrative Failure,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,1884,"['Based', 'loosely', 'Arthur', 'Schnitzler', 'text', 'Reigen/Liebelei', 'Love', 'Time', 'Money', 'human', 'concatenation', 'sexual', 'liaison', 'individuals', 'who', 'hardly', 'know', 'other', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'what', 'end', 'one', 'could', 'hardly', 'decipher', 'reason', 'exercise', 'existential', 'malaise', 'gratuitous', 'fornication', 'film', 'auspicious', 'provenance', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'executive', 'producer', 'Sundance', 'Institute', 'progenitor', 'cast', 'talented', 'actors', 'moment', 'two', 'artistically', 'consequential', 'cinematography', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'disappointed', 'what', 'impressed', 'pointlessly', 'languid', 'depiction', 'desultory', 'sex', 'engaged', 'aimless', 'unhappy', 'people', 'Remarkably', 'Peter', 'Mattei', 'direction', 'script', 'were', 'so', 'poorly', 'realized', 'even', 'inspired', 'almost', 'always', 'entertaining', 'actress', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', 'turned', 'performance', 'fell', 'flat', 'face', 'several', 'early', 'scenes', 'woefully', 'misguided', 'project', 'painful', 'uncharacteristically', 'self-conscious', 'portrayal', 'affection-starved', 'wife', 'prowl', 'was', 'fact', 'so', 'stilted', 'motivationally', 'confused', 'was', 'actually', 'embarrassed', 'forced', 'watch', 'were', 'however', 'few', 'moments', 'middle', 'picture', 'when', 'thought', 'hoped', 'something', 'interest', 'was', 'germinating', 'screen', 'example', 'when', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'role', 'aspiring', 'painter', 'attempts', 'get', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'playing', 'secretary', 'employed', 'art', 'gallery', 'where', 'show', 'canvases', 'model', 'once', 'tension', 'duet', 'awkward', 'seduction', 'quickly', 'inevitably', 'meaningless', 'sex', 'was', 'sadly', 'reminded', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'Mattei', 'vision', 'alienated', ""'love"", 'refused', 'get', 'own', 'way', 'even', 'minute', 'respite', 'submit', 'comments', 'service', 'who', 'are', 'contemplating', 'what', 'was', 'unable', 'avoid']",Love In The Time Of Money

Some of the ways people are trying to have a conversation or turn each other on or off is quite  comical.  There are too many short stories where I felt like I wanted them to develop the story more, but people would not have been interested in watching the entire thing then.  Also, to make a really good story for each scenario could have easily allowed the movie to go over 4 hours.  I guess it does leave room for many sequels or extra movies, but it's hard to make a collage and impress a critical audience.You could tell the story had to be made to that everything would just connect together, and sometimes they had to stretch the storyline to make it come together in one collage.  Basically, the movie starts off with a whore who gets picked up by a contract worker, the contract worker later makes love to another's housewife, the husband of the housewife discovers more than art in an artist, the artist steals someone's girlfriend (Nick's girlfriend), Nick falls in love with a psychic, the psychic falls in love with a suicidal crook, and naturally the crook runs into you can probably guess which one of the characters.",3,cycle of life,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,1357,"['collaged', 'pastiche', 'events', 'where', 'everyone', 'involved', 'connected', 'other', 'somehow', 'would', 'guess', 'first', '20-40', 'minutes', 'watching', 'movie', 'idea', 'also', 'used', 'Crash', 'less', 'effectively', 'ways', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'have', 'conversation', 'turn', 'other', 'off', 'quite', 'comical', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'short', 'stories', 'where', 'felt', 'wanted', 'develop', 'story', 'more', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'interested', 'watching', 'entire', 'thing', 'then', 'Also', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'scenario', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'allowed', 'movie', 'go', '4', 'hours', 'guess', 'leave', 'room', 'many', 'sequels', 'extra', 'movies', 'hard', 'make', 'collage', 'impress', 'critical', 'audience.You', 'could', 'tell', 'story', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'everything', 'would', 'just', 'connect', 'together', 'sometimes', 'had', 'stretch', 'storyline', 'make', 'come', 'together', 'one', 'collage', 'Basically', 'movie', 'whore', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'contract', 'worker', 'contract', 'worker', 'later', 'love', 'housewife', 'husband', 'housewife', 'more', 'art', 'artist', 'artist', 'someone', 'girlfriend', 'Nick', 'girlfriend', 'Nick', 'love', 'psychic', 'psychic', 'falls', 'love', 'suicidal', 'crook', 'naturally', 'crook', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'one', 'characters']",Love In The Time Of Money

Although the expression is uninhibited, the film is never obscene or dirty at all.

I like the characters in the film because they are all open minded, cultureally educated, honest, artistic and creative.It is interesting that the prostitute that shows up in the beginning of the film reappears later on and plays a  role to the entire story.

Next--the husband has sex with a male painter, (who says he isn't gay).  Next--the painter does it with the receptionist at an art gallery.  Next, she has an argument with her young boyfriend and tells him she is having sex with the painter.  Next, the young boyfriend meets an older psychic woman and goes home with her.  She wants to have sex with him but he ducks out at the last minute.  She takes a call and has phone sex with a suicidal stock broker.  Next, the stock broker meets the prostitute and asks her to kill him.This is supposed to be profound!  Egad!  I can't believe Robert Redford was a producer of this tawdry mess.
