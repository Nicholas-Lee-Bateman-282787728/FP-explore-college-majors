Normally story's like this may suffer from one hour TV writing, but I thought the writers did a good job keeping this film consistent with the pacing.

Coffing ""HBO Series lover""","[39, 43]","I bought this film based only on the fact that I was desparate for the release of a western for my collection that was NOT done before 1990.  The market is being flooded with old releases of the 40's, 50's, and 60's at the moment.  Well done with very good performances from LDP and Ernest Borgnine.  Set in a mining community, Lou Diamond Phillips finds himself fresh out of prison and looking for a job.  He finds one, backed by a local sherrif who wants to see him do good. LDP had been sent to prison and was not the guilty party.  The sheriff suspects this.  While working exceeding hard at the mine and contantly being tormented by the mine owner's son, LDP meets a young woman being brutilized by her boyfriend.  Natural course of things is that LDP befriends her and by the last third of the movie a romance occurs.  Ernest Borgnine owns a ranch bordering on the mine owner's land and the mine owner wants it!  He befriends LDP and aids him in the fight against the mine owner.  He plays a jolly, kind hearted man in this part.
