Launay,"[18, 18]","If you asked most persons to identify the greatest intellectual achievements of the 20th century, you would probably hear about space exploration, the cure for polio, or uncovering the structure of DNA.  After watching this film, I would add cracking the Mayan Code belongs in the top 5.  There are literally thousands of Maya ruins with strange pictorial glyphs - but unlike the Egyptian hieroglyphs, scholars had no Rosetta Stone to help translate them.  How then to decipher the ancient language?This film is not a study of the Maya but a study of the personalities and thinkers who tried to interpret the Mayan picture glyphs. The story embraces a 500 year period.  We begin with Bishop de Landa - a 15th century Spanish priest who asked the Mayan scribes to translate the Mayan sounds into western letters...a librarian in Germany who came across one of the few books still preserved of Mayan writing lost in the stacks...an artist with no special academic training who copied and studied the glyphs in Palenque...a Russian soldier who made the intellectual breakthrough that some of the Mayan writing was not like Chinese  (pictures of ideas) but syllabic symbols...a photographer who photographed Mayan pottery for 30 years...and a 12 year old American genius who started publishing detailed scholarly papers on the language of the ancient Mayas.  The string of personalities is endlessly fascinating. This is a beautifully photographed tribute to a group of unknown thinkers who followed their obsession and step by step deciphered the most difficult code possible.If you enjoy this film, the director is also responsible for the exciting movie entitled ""Proteus""...another exceptional documentary about scientific discovery.

It shows the breaking of the Maya written language, in fits and starts, beginning with the deciferment of their system of mathematics. The video shows the many arguments whether the glyphs were phonetic, syllabic or represented entire ideas or concepts.I was surprised by the number of breakthroughs that were made not by scholars but by gifted amateurs who were able to bring a fresh perspective to the process. It was a story of individual insights and creative collaboration assisted by the Xerox machine!Visually, the video was very well done and showed the remains of what was a sophisticated civilization. The dvd does an excellent job of visually introducing the viewer to the glyphs, showing how they are used to make sentences as well as the artistic lattitude the ancient scribes had to express thoughts. I was struck by the amazing artistic talent of those ancient Maya scribes as they recorded royal geneologies, history, diplomacy and a multitude of other things people record for posterity.The dvd contains interviews with those who played major roles in the breaking of the code (in the case of those who are deceased, their thoughts are transmitted to us through their writings) and adds greatly to the viewer's understanding of the circumstances of their contributions as well as their work from their own words.This is an excellent documentary that was well made, informative, entertaining and was able to convey the passion of researchers to solve the puzzle of the Maya glyphs that the story of the Maya could be known to us.

From Russia, to Germany, to the US and Central America, we have the evolution of how the drawings on the Mayan ruins in Southern Mexico and Central America were eventually translated.We meet the characters who were involved in the hard work of discovery, capturing via hand drawings, rubbings, photos, and then deciphering.  How incredible the work of a handful of linguists and artists and archeologists all dovetailed into bringing to life the words engraved in stone on ancient monuments.Interestingly, this was all done without a Rosetta Stone.  However, four books from the late 16th century were preserved in libraries throughout Europe.  Hundreds of other books from the time, were destroyed in a massive book burning by the religious powers of the day.  These preserved books became the catalyst of interest of people who started to see things in what they observed.  Observations that were not always correct, lead to more discovery.  In the 1800s more and more of the ruins in the Yucatan/Chiapas, Guatemala and Honduras, were uncovered and the puzzle was put together.What I got from this is two fold, there were numerous attempts from very bright people to get to the bottom of Mayan writing. The current flow of information regarding 2012, may actually cloud the importance of the information found.  We can now read for certain, the complex histories of a grand culture before its demise.  What we learn may help us to avert disaster in the future.Additionally, we see the Mayan descendants the many millions who live in relative poverty, being introduced with pride to their history.

In the 16th century, Spanish invaders burned Mayan books and remorselessly exterminated their hieroglyphic literacy. For two hundred years, scientists and linguists have worked to relearn the knowledge once lost, and uncover the mysteries and heritage of an ancient civilization. Though scholars from around the world applied their brainpower to the puzzle, the final breakthrough came from an 18-year-old boy who had been immersed in the glyphs since his early childhood. Revealed, the ancient hieroglyphs tell of an astonishing cosmic mythology, held by a people who burned their blood to invoke the Vision Serpent, that interleaves the deeds of mythical heroes with the cycles of planets and stars.

There are occasional brilliant insights, but this shows the painstaking, behind the scenes work done by an array of professional (and amateur) researchers that lead up to that one big leap.  Einstein didn't work in a vacuum, many researchers spent decades amassing the work that Einstein would ultimately tie together to develop relativity.  So it is in some ways with the breaking of the Maya code.  The Mayans left an incredibly detailed account of their history and culture right in front of us, and for centuries we hadn't a clue as to what it meant.  A mystery that started with the Spanish conquest of central America several centuries ago, and only resolved (well, mostly resolved) in the past few decades.  In this DVD, you'll watch how generations of researchers slowly put together bits and pieces of the puzzle.  You'll listen to accounts of young researchers as they recall the high points of key conferences and key moments, as well as the arduous months in the jungles carefully photographing and drawing the Mayan symbols on temples, stelae, and other antiquities.  The symbols are also reproduced graphically so that the viewer can see how the written Mayan language all fits together.  You probably won't be reading the symbols on the temple walls by the end of the DVD, but you'll be able to recognize the symbols and how they all fit together! There are so many fascinating details presented in this outstanding documentary.  One of the most famous, most knowledgeable Mayan scholars was completely wrong on one key aspect of the translation, and probably held up progress for decades, but quickly and graciously relented when shown convincingly that he was wrong.  One thing that puzzled linguists for years about the Mayan language was that they were unsure whether is was an alphabetic language (like English) or a purely symbolic language (like Chinese).  The alphabetic languages have several dozen characters, and symbolic languages have hundreds or thousands.  The Mayan language had about 80 or so.  The great breakthrough came when it was realized that some of the characters had the same meaning and that there were only 30 or 40 distinct characters - the language was alphabetic.
