808732,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B0001JXQ2O,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","This movie, a continuation of the great Gunsmoke series starring James Arness as Matt Dillon, demonstrates that even the best of premises can simply grow tired and run out of steam. The story opens years after Matt put down his lawman's badge, he is now a cattle rancher and at the graveside of the woman that bore his daughter Beth. When some of his cattle are stolen, Matt puts Beth on the train for an Eastern boarding school and sets out to find them. Before Beth leaves town, Matt has to set some wild young men straight after they make a play for Beth.While he is on the trail of his cattle, Matt enters a valley where there is a blood feud between two families as well as an ex-army Colonel that is leading a movement to rid the area of rustlers and other thieves. Beth only travels a short distance on the train before disembarking and buying a horse to ride back to the ranch. She then convinces Will, a man just back from school in the east, to accompany her as she follows Matt.There are adventures and the inevitable shoot-out at the end, but none of it really rises to the level of the tense action and deep relationships between the primary characters that was so much a part of the Gunsmoke series. Some of the action and events seems forced, as the producers appear to be just trying to develop enough action to fill out the required amount of time.",3,"Evidence that the ""Gunsmoke"" series has run out of steam",1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,1365,"['movie', 'continuation', 'great', 'Gunsmoke', 'series', 'starring', 'James', 'Arness', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'even', 'best', 'premises', 'can', 'simply', 'grow', 'tired', 'run', 'out', 'steam', 'story', 'years', 'Matt', 'put', 'down', 'lawman', 'badge', 'now', 'cattle', 'rancher', 'graveside', 'woman', 'bore', 'daughter', 'Beth', 'When', 'cattle', 'are', 'stolen', 'Matt', 'Beth', 'train', 'Eastern', 'boarding', 'school', 'out', 'find', 'Beth', 'town', 'Matt', 'set', 'wild', 'young', 'men', 'straight', 'make', 'play', 'Beth.While', 'trail', 'cattle', 'Matt', 'valley', 'where', 'blood', 'feud', 'two', 'families', 'as', 'well', 'ex-army', 'Colonel', 'leading', 'movement', 'rid', 'area', 'rustlers', 'other', 'thieves', 'Beth', 'only', 'short', 'distance', 'train', 'disembarking', 'buying', 'horse', 'ride', 'back', 'ranch', 'then', 'convinces', 'Will', 'man', 'just', 'back', 'school', 'east', 'accompany', 'are', 'adventures', 'inevitable', 'shoot-out', 'end', 'none', 'really', 'level', 'tense', 'action', 'deep', 'relationships', 'primary', 'characters', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'Gunsmoke', 'series', 'action', 'events', 'forced', 'producers', 'appear', 'be', 'just', 'trying', 'develop', 'enough', 'action', 'fill', 'out', 'required', 'amount', 'time']",N/A

808737,A1MPPAKA7VJO3P,B0001JXQ2O,Pop culture man,"[1, 1]","Like 'The Long Ride', this made for TV Gunsmoke movie starring James Arness is very satisfying and well made. It has strong production values, an absorbing plot and many well-staged action sequences. At times the violence is brutal but always in context and not excessively graphic. Arness convinces again as the morally upright lawman and there is an endearing performance by Amy Stock-Poynton who plays his daughter. The script by Earl Wallace provides the understated, at times terse dialogue which sounds authentic and also allows satisfying deepening of the viewer's understanding of the characters. The direction by Jerry Jameson, who also directed 'The Long Ride', is crisp and makes great use of landscape and colour to convey the tough life of the Old West. As an aside, actor Jason Lively, who played Rusty Griswold in 'European Vacation', delivers his role with style and even keeps the same first name as he had as a Griswold.
