It gives insight to the politics of that time but it also shows the kind of personality Lincoln had. It humanizes him more than any other film because he is not treated as a superhero or a myth but it shows how he handled the stress of his presidency and the perseverance and politicking he had to do and deal with in order to get his amendment passed. This movie has also has moments of humor with Tommy Lee Jones' role. The dialogue is quick and it takes a little bit to catch on to the conflict this movie interprets but it is nevertheless entertaining. I find that time in history interesting so I enjoyed this movie.

In short, something described as gold, can often turn out to be merely gold-plated. Such is the case with Lincoln. There is no doubt that the cast do extremely well in their appointed roles, & this is particularly true with Tommy Lee Jones, who plays his role to perfection. The same applies to David Strathairn who is simply outstanding, so much so in fact, that it defies belief that he wasn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. That decision just has to be the oversight of the acting year. As for Daniel Day-Lewis, undoubtedly one of the finest actors in the world today, & normally a guarantee of a stellar performance, he failed to impress me as Abe Lincoln. He mumbled through much of his performance, & constantly held that hang-dog look, so symptomatic of someone with constant back & neck pain. OK, I know Lincoln was no spring chicken, but Day-Lewis made him look older that the man really was. For me it was a disappointing performance. As usual, Sally Field produced a very credible performance as Mrs Lincoln, although whether it's deserving of an Oscar, is another matter. There certainly have been better performances from many actresses this year. On the upside though, the cinematography & production design work exceptional & it's great to see that those responsible are now Oscar nominees. They are certainly deserving. Now to directing; Steven Spielberg has brought us some wonderful films during his career as to date, however, on the basis of some of his more recent works, it would not be wrong to suggest that his talents have been somewhat on the wane in recent years. The heady days of ET, Schindler's List, Indiana Jones, The Colour Purple, Close Encounters, Saving Private Ryan & the like, are well & truly past. War Horse, while a great story, performed by a great cast, again featuring great cinematography & production & set work, was lacking in direction, & this was highlighted in the film's conclusion which seemed limp & contrived. After watching Lincoln, I find it so curious that Spielberg would be Oscar nominated for Directing. Particularly when Ben Affleck was overlooked for his stellar work in Argo, which together with Django Unchained & Silver Linings Playbook, are the only real films deserving of the Best Picture Oscar.

McQuade,"[5, 7]","Lincoln traces the last few months of the 16th president's life, focusing on his effort to pass the 13th Amendment to the Constitution ending slavery once and for all.Many reviewers have already noted that this is a movie about the US political process rather than the Civil War. But the few brief scenes dealing directly with the fighting - muddy hand to hand combat between black Federal troops and Confederates, Lincoln and his son's visit to an army hospital, and the aftermath a battle outside Richmond - give a powerful sense of the horror of the fighting in that war and the weight that it bore on Lincoln's conscience.The cast of the movie is outstanding and it is difficult to fault a single performance: Tommy Lee-Jones and James Spader deliver scene stealing turns. Jared Harris and David Strathairn less showy performances but no less well judged. And Sally Field brings a great level of sympathy to the role of the often unfairly maligned, though undoubtedly difficult, Mary Lincoln.The centrepiece in this movie is, of course, Daniel Day-Lewis' stunning performance as Lincoln. It is all the more powerful because it is so human: indeed part of Lincoln's greatness arose from his profound humanity and capacity to relate on that level to some of his most intractable rivals.Of course, in spite of Lincoln's efforts, slavery remains a huge problem in the contemporary world. The International Labour Organization estimates that a minimum of 21 million people are in forced labour in every region of the world today.

Sure, it's got all of the political mumbo-jumbo, but I loved that it also showed the very complex portrait of Lincoln, the man.

It might help the viewer to know going into this movie that the story here centers around Lincoln's struggle to get the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution passed (which would outlaw slavery), and is not a full biography picture (bio-pic). Tommy Lee Jones shines and marvels as Republican Congressional leader Thaddeus Stevens! The best thing about Spielberg's films is the humanity that shines through -- not just from the actors but also in the way he blocks and shoots scenes (i.e., there's a scene inCatch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)when Leonardo DiCaprio hugs his father, Christopher Walken, and there's a simple shot of Walken's hand on the back of DiCaprio -- it's a simple shot that conveys so much emotion about fathers and sons without any words being said).

The nation is at war, and Lincoln is trying to pass the 13th Amendment. His secretary of State William Seward ( David Strathairn) is reluctant and considers it impossible. The film shows Lincoln's political acumen as he relies on lobbyist, cutting deal and pleading to get this done. He was a great politician even before he became a great president. It is intimate look at the happenings behind the 13th Amendment.

1592567,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B009AMANBA,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","A wise Oscar prognosticator once said that you can't truly predict the Oscars unless you actually see the films nominated.  I don't always agree with this, but I understand that seeing a film can help you understand why the vote is going to swing a certain way.  I think that `Lincoln' is proof of that.  Up until Oscar night I was holding my breath for a Oscar shock to happen and the envelope to read Hugh Jackman's name, and I held out hope that that could happen.  Had I seen `Lincoln' prior to the Oscar ceremony, I wouldn't have had such hope.  No, Daniel Day-Lewis's steamroll through the critics' awards and Oscar precursors was a bizarre thing for me.  I just didn't understand why he was going to win his third Oscar so soon for playing such a seemingly un-baity character.I get it now.I'm not saying that I agree with the win.  In fact, I consider what Joaquin Phoenix did to be a greater triumph and he was the truly deserved winner, but despite all my preconceived reservations about the film and the actor (Day-Lewis can be far too mannered for my taste, and I find his depiction as the `god of acting' to be complete hyperbole) I was kind of blown away.  I didn't love the movie (a tad too stagey and Spielberg's impulse to go for the preachy was too present in some scenes) but I really liked it, and what Daniel Day-Lewis does was outstanding.  He pulled himself back, he took a deep breath, and he carried this film from start to finish.  I completely understand why he won, and it isn't a win I can fault.  He was a total force of nature, but not in the overbearing way, and he was so well rounded (the bits of humor were fantastically played).Sadly, for me, when Day-Lewis is not on the screen the film doesn't exactly motivate my attention.  I found Kushner's writing to be free-flowing, which was nice, but this was basically a collection of conversations and not all of them were particularly inspired, more like fundamental.  While I liked the spiced personality that was created in Lincoln (he felt like such a real person, which I was afraid was going to get clouded under the political eyes of Spielberg), but I'll admit that some of the humor sprinkled in key scenes felt out of place and unnecessary (Spader's reaction to seeing Lincoln felt out of place).The rest of the cast was well formed but I was not as enamored with them as so many others were.  They felt secondary, very secondary.  Whenever Day-Lewis was on the screen, this was very much HIS movie, and when he wasn't there I was waiting for him to come back.The format for the film itself worked for the most part.  The opening battle sequence was superbly staged, the development of the relationship between Lincoln and his wife (and especially with regard to their eldest son) was surprisingly deep despite being far from the center of attention, and the verbal spattering all over the courtroom scenes, while at times a tad overdone and repetitive, add life to certain characters (I'm still not sure what all that hype was over Jones' performance here, but he was a hoot juggling some of his lines).At the end of the day, this is a good film.  It was both better and worse than I anticipated.  It was presented to me as a masterpiece, and so in that respect this really is highly flawed and doesn't live up, but in the back of my mind I was prepared to find this to be a total bore and was prepared for the worst with Spielberg's heavy handed direction, so in that respect I was pretty happy since I was never bored and Spielberg held back in many key scenes (although those bookends were atrociously overstated in the `Lincoln is a saint' department).",4,An admirable attempt to anoint a saint...,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,3646,"['wise', 'Oscar', 'prognosticator', 'once', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'truly', 'predict', 'Oscars', 'actually', 'see', 'films', 'nominated', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'agree', 'understand', 'seeing', 'film', 'can', 'help', 'understand', 'why', 'vote', 'going', 'swing', 'certain', 'way', 'think', 'Lincoln', 'proof', 'Up', 'Oscar', 'night', 'was', 'holding', 'breath', 'Oscar', 'shock', 'happen', 'envelope', 'read', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'name', 'held', 'out', 'hope', 'could', 'happen', 'Had', 'seen', 'Lincoln', 'prior', 'Oscar', 'ceremony', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'such', 'hope', 'No', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'steamroll', 'critics', 'awards', 'Oscar', 'precursors', 'was', 'bizarre', 'thing', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'going', 'win', 'third', 'Oscar', 'so', 'soon', 'playing', 'seemingly', 'un-baity', 'character.I', 'get', 'now.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'agree', 'win', 'fact', 'consider', 'what', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'did', 'be', 'greater', 'triumph', 'was', 'truly', 'deserved', 'winner', 'preconceived', 'reservations', 'film', 'actor', 'Day-Lewis', 'can', 'be', 'far', 'too', 'mannered', 'taste', 'find', 'depiction', 'god', 'acting', 'be', 'complete', 'hyperbole', 'was', 'kind', 'blown', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'movie', 'tad', 'too', 'stagey', 'Spielberg', 'impulse', 'go', 'preachy', 'was', 'too', 'present', 'scenes', 'really', 'liked', 'what', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'was', 'outstanding', 'pulled', 'back', 'took', 'deep', 'breath', 'carried', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'completely', 'understand', 'why', 'won', ""n't"", 'win', 'can', 'fault', 'was', 'total', 'force', 'nature', 'not', 'overbearing', 'way', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'rounded', 'bits', 'humor', 'were', 'fantastically', 'played', '.Sadly', 'when', 'Day-Lewis', 'not', 'screen', 'film', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'motivate', 'attention', 'found', 'Kushner', 'writing', 'be', 'free-flowing', 'was', 'nice', 'was', 'basically', 'collection', 'conversations', 'not', 'were', 'particularly', 'inspired', 'more', 'fundamental', 'liked', 'spiced', 'personality', 'was', 'created', 'Lincoln', 'felt', 'real', 'person', 'was', 'afraid', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'clouded', 'political', 'eyes', 'Spielberg', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'humor', 'sprinkled', 'key', 'scenes', 'felt', 'place', 'unnecessary', 'Spader', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'Lincoln', 'felt', 'place', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'well', 'formed', 'was', 'not', 'enamored', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'were', 'felt', 'secondary', 'very', 'secondary', 'Whenever', 'Day-Lewis', 'was', 'screen', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'HIS', 'movie', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'waiting', 'come', 'back.The', 'format', 'film', 'worked', 'most', 'part', 'opening', 'battle', 'sequence', 'was', 'superbly', 'staged', 'development', 'relationship', 'Lincoln', 'wife', 'especially', 'regard', 'eldest', 'son', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'being', 'far', 'center', 'attention', 'verbal', 'spattering', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'times', 'tad', 'overdone', 'repetitive', 'add', 'life', 'certain', 'characters', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'hype', 'was', 'Jones', 'performance', 'here', 'was', 'hoot', 'juggling', 'lines', '.At', 'end', 'day', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'worse', 'anticipated', 'was', 'presented', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'respect', 'really', 'highly', 'flawed', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'back', 'mind', 'was', 'prepared', 'find', 'be', 'total', 'bore', 'was', 'prepared', 'worst', 'Spielberg', 'heavy', 'handed', 'direction', 'so', 'respect', 'was', 'pretty', 'happy', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'Spielberg', 'held', 'back', 'many', 'key', 'scenes', 'bookends', 'were', 'atrociously', 'overstated', 'Lincoln', 'saint', 'department']",N/A

The audience comes to the theater with a firmly held opinion in place and the film is judged by how closely it conforms to that opinion. Daniel Day-Lewis is therefore faced with the problem of not offending the  ""Lincoln-Is-Holier-Than-God"" crowd while at the same time retaining some degree of artistic integrity. I think he walks that fine line as well as anyone could, but the nature of the task he has undertaken imposes its own limits on what he can do with the role. Kudos to him for his considerable effort.Sally Fields as the unstable Mary Todd Lincoln is, IMHO, shallow, entirely predictable, and as cardboard as a shipping box.Tommy Lee Jones as abolitionist senator Thaddeus Stevens delivers his usual strong performance and is clearly the most memorable supporting character in the cast.The opening, depicting the fighting at Petersburg, Virginia, is extraordinary.

1592575,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B009AMANBA,Anthony L.,"[12, 18]","OK film fans and movie watchers, stick with me through this review, cause it could be long, but I'll try to keep it from being boring! Shall we begin?Lincoln (2012) was directed by Steven Spielberg, a name synonymous with great film-making. His resume is long, illustrious, and legendary. Jaws. Close Encounters of the Third Kind. E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Raiders of the Lost Ark. Schindler's List. Saving Private Ryan. Catch Me If You Can. Minority Report. The list goes on and on.In 2012, Spielberg finally got around to doing something he had on his mind for almost 15 years - a biopic of Abraham Lincoln. After a long and detailed pre-production, in which both Liam Neeson and Robert Downey Jr. were subsequently cast as Lincoln and dropped, Spielberg cast the electrifying 2-time Academy Award winning British-Irish actor Daniel Day-Lewis. It was the first of a number of good choices that would end up as the brilliant movie Lincoln.1. Daniel Day-Lewis became the first actor in cinema history to win the coveted Best Actor Oscar award 3 times with his stunning performance as the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. And what a towering, electrifying, riveting performance it is. Day-Lewis, as Seth Macfarlane so snidely pointed out at the Oscars, stayed in character for the duration of the shoot - and a relatively hard shoot it was, considering the copious amounts of dialogue and the accent the role required.But man did he succeed! You've heard of method acting, but you haven't seen anything like this. Day-Lewis completely disappears into the character, until (you think to yourself) you could only be watching the real deal - the real Lincoln! It's extraordinary! It's brilliant! It's (insert synonym of amazing)!In my opinion, Lincoln is worth watching for one of the greatest performances in modern history - that of Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln.His is a Lincoln of depth, sensitivity, and fervour, as much a family man as a man of action, one who would just as easily tell a funny anecdote as declare war. It is by far the best portrayal of the man yet.Sally Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln, a woman who, in life, suffered from migraines, depression, and bipolar disorder, yet remained faithful and true to her husband until his assassination. Her portrayal can come off as whiny, but that is precisely the point; that was what Mary Todd was like in life. She and Day-Lewis share what is in my opinion, the best scene of the film - an emotional piece where the two scream at each other, angrily pouring out suppressed emotions and regrets over their son's decision to join the army.Tommy Lee Jones provides a standout, Oscar-nominated performance as Thaddeus Stevens, a grouchy, stolid supporter of the abolishment of slavery. Did I say something about the movie's best scene? I was wrong - the best scene is almost anything with Stevens in it. Take your pick between the ""It opens"" scene, or the courtroom rant against Lee Pace's slimy lawyer. Tommy Lee Jones was robbed of his Best Supporting Oscar by Christoph Waltz, ironically in a movie also about slavery.Day-Lewis, Field, and Jones are supported by a talented, all star cast of historical figures, some in little more then cameo roles, which I will go through briefly here: Joseph Gordon-Levitt (beyond criticism as Robert Todd Lincoln), David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Lee Pace (a favorite role of mine, gets some really good scenes), James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, John Hawkes (who form a trio providing much of the comic relief), Jared Harris (as Ulysses S. Grant), David Oyelowo, Lucas Haas, and Dane DeHaan. Filling such a rich historical films with actors of this calibre enhances ones viewing experience, and realizes the world more fully.2. The cinematography of Lincoln is very underrated. When compared to the cinematography of Life of Pi or The Hobbit, Lincoln starts to look a little grey and grim, but surprisingly, that is where it succeeds. Most of the movie is filmed indoors, with little more then a few candles, gas lamps, or windows to illuminate the scenery. As the film progressed, I became more and more impressed at the ways the cinematographer (Janusz Kaminski) illuminated the movie. It's a small victory, and one that few people notice, but it's there to admire on return viewings, along with the John Williams score and the brilliant costumes - so authentic you don't even look at them!3. OK, now I'm not an American. And I don't know much about American history. I know who Lincoln is and what he did, but quite frankly couldn't care less about Thaddeus Stevens or William Seward or Edwin Stanton. The most fascinating part of Lincolns life was his assassination, and the conspiracy leading up to it.Sadly, but respectfully, even reverently, Spielberg shies away from showing the assassination, which comes out of a mix of respect and dignity towards the character.[Note: For a detailed, riveting look at the assassination of Lincoln, I recommend the National Geographic documentary, narrated by Tom Hanks,Killing Lincoln]And now we come to my main CON of this otherwise great film - the story. Now keep in mind that I'm not an American, and I really did love the film!The story just couldn't keep me interested. It didn't embroil me in the plot, and for half the time (with my rudimentary knowledge of American history) it seemed like a mix between a documentary and a soap opera. I had no idea what was going on, and strained to hear what fundamental plot points characters were going over in hushed voices.Lincoln jumps right into the heart of American politics without any sort of background or prequel, and to NON-Americans, this can be confusing and non-relevant. It's a movie about Americans, by Americans, for Americans.4. So, in conclusion, Lincoln is a film with stupendous feats of acting that defy comprehension, but the story appeals mostly to the USA (as the international box-office gross shows). I liked Lincoln, and gave it five stars for the acting (3.5 stars for the story), and plus, it's nice to see The Beard back in the game!Lincoln (2012) has my strong recommendation!",4,"Consider THIS

1592576,A3HK421SZATIDW,B009AMANBA,Archer1941,"[1, 1]","First of all, Daniel Day Lewis's Abraham Lincoln is probably the closest any of us will ever get to seeing the 16th President in the flesh. He is totally believable and his performance is subtle and endearing. When he walks the halls of the White House to leave for Ford's Theater, you truly do not want him to go --so kudos to Daniel Day Lewis and to Mr. Spielberg for providing the &#34;stage&#34; for this performance.Overall, the movie is good, not great. What was missing for me was not so much the context for passage of the 13th Amendment, to the contrary there was almost too much exposition explaining how hard the bill would be to pass and how difficult it would be for the President to move forward with that decision. What is missing is the context for why it was Abraham Lincoln who led this fight, why he was there at that time in history and how he obtained the skills (both personal and political) that helped him lead this fight. We are shown and told repeatedly what a great leader the President is but we are never shown why he is a great leader. His amazing life story, the choices he made, and his evolution from shopkeeper in New Salem to President of the United States all contributed to his leadership during the Civil War.Obviously telling that story would require a larger scope and longer movie (or multiple movies), and I get that the purpose of this movie was to show the passage of the 13th Amendment but the net effect is that, despite the great performance, Steven Spielberg's Lincoln doesn't quite get past the mythological Lincoln of history. He is still a bit of a mystery, and perhaps he should remain a mystery.Unfortunately, there are other actors in this movie that, while good, were ultimately distracting. Tommy Lee Jones, for example, is ALWAYS Tommy Lee Jones. One surprise was James Spader who was nearly unrecognizable. Sally Field also gives a subtle performance as the First Lady (a role that could have been played over-the-top and wasn't) but in the end, she did not blend into her role as well as Daniel Day Lewis did. I wish they would have just cast unknowns for these key parts, but thats a minor quibble.

1592577,ARA48345JZPZR,B009AMANBA,Archmaker,"[133, 161]","Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner made some interesting and difficult choices in Lincoln that I think have succeeded in making a brilliant film about one of the most written about historical figures ever, and certainly the most written about and familiar American historical figure.  And yet despite a billion words written about this man he still somehow remains an enigma with something withheld and unrevealable about the man.  No doubt that is his continuing fascination to us and I have no doubt many more millions of words will be written, again vainly trying to get at the essence of the man.  It is far easier to gaze in wonderous respect at the marble statue in his unmatched Memorial than to try to find the human being within the marble.Spielberg and Kushner have done their best to try to find the man with the inestimable assistance of Daniel Day Lewis' genius.  If they haven't succeeded completely, well they are in good company with a thousand other biographers.  I liked the closeness and intimacy of the film.  I liked the quiet.  I liked the touching, beautiful and subtle small details: Lincoln lying down on the floor next to his sleeping son, the ever present shawl on his shoulders, the often stooped gait, Lincoln's ready reach for the illustrative yet sometimes illusive joke or story told with great good humor, Lincoln holding hands with Stimson as the war news comes in, Lincoln's fondness for and engagement with his young aides and soldiers, his gentle touches and the incredible mastery of his emotions, his rectitude and subtle manipulation of the obstreperous, passionate, often obtuse political allies and foes.Throughout, Day Lewis is masterful in his delivery, conveying the homeliness of the man and yet the incredible strength and the sorrow that was with him every day of his Presidency that brought many of his detractors, especially Seward and others in the ""team of rivals"" to come to respect and love him.  He's got not just the look, the voice, the walk and movements of the man down, he has the gentleness, and the innate dignity of the man as well. This is Lincoln at the end of the war and his soul-aching weariness coupled with his steely resolution is evident in every frame.  He's superb.  The rest of the characters in the drama have been cast carefully with wonderful actors who actually often resemble the real men they're playing.  I could single out Tommy Lee Jones, David Straithairn, James Spader etc., but frankly everyone is marvelous in this cast down to every one of the maddening and quarrelsome Congressmen.And I thought Sally Fields was a fine Mary Lincoln.  Their scenes together played very well and conveyed in a few brief lines the struggles, regrets, tragic losses and difficulties that divide and also unite a long married couple who have weathered many travails.  I found it convincing.And finally, I am glad the focus of the film was the struggle to pass the 13th Amendment.  Unless you're a history buff, I imagine this will come as some surprise to many and I found their handling of the politics and personalities at play both fascinating and engaging.  I was absorbed and I imagine others will find revelatory the difficulty of passing this crucial legislation. And why not focus on this often overlooked struggle?  As the film carefully explains, the whole moral purpose of the war, abolition, could have been undone postwar without it.Some may find this narrowing of the events of the film to the last 6 months of Lincoln's life and the struggle to legislate a disappointment.  Not me.  As mentioned, we have had millions of words and many films and documentaries covering the overview of Lincoln's life. I applaud Spielberg and Kushner making an intimate film closeup and intense and, yes, full of dialogue and argument as the framework to illustrate an exceptional man in unimaginably difficult and tragic times, and finding within this closeup a glimpse of the man and his relations with wife, children, and friends and foes.  It is a brilliantly acted and directed illustration of democracy being tested to its limits, ornery and contentious even within the midst of Civil War, and human beings at their most venal and at their most noble.Many insights and much of this history is conveyed in dialogue (Lincoln's admission of his assumption of powers not necessarily granted him and ignoring of the law when he deemed it necessary is a prime example) and a potent line here and there speaks volumes about the war, the law, the Presidency, his marriage, his sorrow, his guile, and his steadfastness.  Nicely done and will promote repeated viewing.As expected from Spielberg, the production values are marvelous.  Well done in all departments.",5,"Interesting, difficult choices succeed superbly",1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,4723,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'made', 'interesting', 'difficult', 'choices', 'Lincoln', 'think', 'have', 'succeeded', 'making', 'brilliant', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'written', 'about', 'historical', 'figures', 'ever', 'certainly', 'most', 'written', 'familiar', 'American', 'historical', 'figure', 'yet', 'billion', 'words', 'written', 'man', 'still', 'somehow', 'enigma', 'something', 'withheld', 'unrevealable', 'man', 'No', 'doubt', 'continuing', 'fascination', 'have', 'doubt', 'many', 'more', 'millions', 'words', 'will', 'be', 'written', 'again', 'vainly', 'trying', 'get', 'essence', 'man', 'far', 'easier', 'gaze', 'wonderous', 'respect', 'marble', 'statue', 'unmatched', 'Memorial', 'try', 'find', 'human', 'being', 'marble.Spielberg', 'Kushner', 'have', 'done', 'best', 'try', 'find', 'man', 'inestimable', 'assistance', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'genius', 'have', ""n't"", 'succeeded', 'completely', 'well', 'are', 'good', 'company', 'thousand', 'other', 'biographers', 'liked', 'closeness', 'intimacy', 'film', 'liked', 'quiet', 'liked', 'touching', 'beautiful', 'subtle', 'small', 'details', 'Lincoln', 'lying', 'down', 'floor', 'sleeping', 'son', 'ever', 'present', 'shawl', 'shoulders', 'often', 'stooped', 'gait', 'Lincoln', 'ready', 'reach', 'illustrative', 'yet', 'sometimes', 'illusive', 'joke', 'story', 'told', 'great', 'good', 'humor', 'Lincoln', 'holding', 'hands', 'Stimson', 'war', 'news', 'Lincoln', 'fondness', 'engagement', 'young', 'aides', 'soldiers', 'gentle', 'touches', 'incredible', 'mastery', 'emotions', 'rectitude', 'subtle', 'manipulation', 'obstreperous', 'passionate', 'often', 'obtuse', 'political', 'allies', 'foes.Throughout', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'masterful', 'delivery', 'conveying', 'homeliness', 'man', 'yet', 'incredible', 'strength', 'sorrow', 'was', 'day', 'Presidency', 'brought', 'many', 'detractors', 'especially', 'Seward', 'others', 'team', 'rivals', 'come', 'respect', 'love', 'got', 'not', 'just', 'look', 'voice', 'walk', 'movements', 'man', 'down', 'gentleness', 'innate', 'dignity', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'Lincoln', 'end', 'war', 'soul-aching', 'weariness', 'coupled', 'steely', 'resolution', 'evident', 'frame', 'superb', 'rest', 'characters', 'drama', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'carefully', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'who', 'actually', 'often', 'resemble', 'real', 'men', ""'re"", 'playing', 'could', 'single', 'out', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'David', 'Straithairn', 'James', 'Spader', 'etc.', 'frankly', 'everyone', 'marvelous', 'cast', 'down', 'one', 'maddening', 'quarrelsome', 'Congressmen.And', 'thought', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'was', 'fine', 'Mary', 'Lincoln', 'scenes', 'together', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'conveyed', 'few', 'brief', 'lines', 'struggles', 'regrets', 'tragic', 'losses', 'difficulties', 'divide', 'also', 'unite', 'long', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'weathered', 'many', 'travails', 'found', 'finally', 'am', 'glad', 'focus', 'film', 'was', 'struggle', 'pass', '13th', 'Amendment', ""'re"", 'history', 'buff', 'imagine', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'many', 'found', 'handling', 'politics', 'personalities', 'play', 'fascinating', 'engaging', 'was', 'absorbed', 'imagine', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'revelatory', 'difficulty', 'passing', 'crucial', 'legislation', 'why', 'not', 'focus', 'often', 'overlooked', 'struggle', 'film', 'carefully', 'whole', 'moral', 'purpose', 'war', 'abolition', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'undone', 'postwar', 'it.Some', 'may', 'find', 'narrowing', 'events', 'film', 'last', '6', 'months', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'struggle', 'legislate', 'disappointment', 'Not', 'mentioned', 'have', 'had', 'millions', 'words', 'many', 'films', 'documentaries', 'covering', 'overview', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'applaud', 'Spielberg', 'Kushner', 'making', 'intimate', 'film', 'closeup', 'intense', 'yes', 'full', 'dialogue', 'argument', 'framework', 'illustrate', 'exceptional', 'man', 'unimaginably', 'difficult', 'tragic', 'times', 'finding', 'closeup', 'glimpse', 'man', 'relations', 'wife', 'children', 'friends', 'foes', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'directed', 'illustration', 'democracy', 'being', 'tested', 'limits', 'ornery', 'contentious', 'even', 'midst', 'Civil', 'War', 'human', 'beings', 'most', 'venal', 'most', 'noble.Many', 'insights', 'much', 'history', 'conveyed', 'dialogue', 'Lincoln', 'admission', 'assumption', 'powers', 'not', 'necessarily', 'granted', 'ignoring', 'law', 'when', 'deemed', 'necessary', 'prime', 'example', 'potent', 'line', 'here', 'there', 'volumes', 'war', 'law', 'Presidency', 'marriage', 'sorrow', 'guile', 'steadfastness', 'Nicely', 'done', 'will', 'promote', 'repeated', 'viewing.As', 'expected', 'Spielberg', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'marvelous', 'Well', 'done', 'departments']",N/A

This movie centers largely on that final four months as debate raged on. With the war winding down, Lincoln's dilemma was that he had used his War Powers to free a people from slavery, but that there was, at the moment, no way of keeping them free once the war ended. if the laws remained as they were, those freed could be declared as property and ordered back into bondage again, and while he held a majority, he was still shy a number of votes that could pass the Amendment he proposed. This was political arm wrangling at the time and this movie concentrated more on the political front than the war front. Here we see Lincoln portrayed as a patient, gentle man with friends and family, but also a shrewd mastermind capable of issuing a command as sternly as any general and certainly not afraid of accepting the consequences of any manipulations he might make.

1592621,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B009AMANBA,Blago Jones,"[21, 26]","Why you shouldn't see it:Talking. If you aren't a fan of having dialog in your movies, then Lincoln probably isn't for you. So if you're one of the folks who voted for The Artist last year, you may not be too fond of this one. But, good thing for this movie, only two films lacking in dialog in the history of the Academy Awards have ever won best picture, and if all of the dialog was removed from this movie, it would probably just consist of opening and closing credits. And that would be a shame, because these are some old school credits without any entertainment value on their own.Politics. It's not that they're spending the duration of the movie talking about anything. They spend the whole time talking in, about, and around politics. Even in what you would think would be personal family moments, there are still at least strong political undertones to the conversation. So you can imagine the scenes that are set in the political arena, where political discourse would make a good deal more sense. There are lots of men with funny hair saying lots of things to posture themselves in the debate.History. In case you hadn't gathered, the plot of this film takes place in an historical setting, a little less than 150 years ago. And no, it's not an historical fiction, where they just take the setting and then add in a really crazy plot, a la Wild Wild West. It's a straight up history, 90% of which takes place within landmarks such as the White House and the Capitol Building (the one in Washington, D.C.). So if histories make you uncomfortable and/or bore you to tears, this one might not hold your interest.Why you should see it:Daniel Day-Lewis. This part is probably obvious. Or maybe it isn't obvious. If I'm going to be honest with you, I'll tell you that I watched this entire movie trying to convince myself that I was, in fact, watching Daniel Day-Lewis and not Abraham Lincoln. Try as I might, I was laughably unsuccessful. I could look the man right in the beard and not tell him from the man who lived a century and a half ago. I'm not sure what to say about Day-Lewis, other than the fact that I'm glad his method acting didn't lead him to demand that they film Lincoln's assassination using a real gun. With real bullets. I want to see more movies with this man being someone completely and totally not himself.Tommy Lee Jones. He plays a supporting character (congressman Thaddeus Stevens), obviously, so his role isn't quite as prominent as Day-Lewis', but that doesn't mean he isn't essential to the film. And it's good for you that he is, because every time he shows up on camera, he steals the scene. His ornery attitude and the fact that he's a representative from Pennsylvania may make you think he's from Philadelphia, but he shockingly is not. His witty, sarcastic characterization frequently brings a much-needed lightness to the film.Steven Spielberg. I'm not sure there was a person I was more disappointed in last year than Steven Spielberg. The fact that he would ever even think about releasing a movie as terrible as War Horse just makes me sad in my heart. The good news is that he has acquitted himself nicely here. He takes a moment of American history, finds the story behind it, and creates a gripping, expertly told tale. Much like Affleck with Argo, Spielberg is somehow able to make the audience feel suspense over the outcome of a plot that it already knows. It's not like Congress skipped the 13th Amendment. He's also done a fantastic job of casting, from the notable (and award-recognized) efforts of Day-Lewis, Jones, and Sally Field to any of the rest of the ensemble cast. Every time you turn around, there is another face that you recognize giving their hand in telling this important tale (keep an eye out for James Spader, who is excellent).History. America hasn't always gotten everything right. Actually, they've gotten a lot of things wrong, but sometimes it's good to be reminded of the things it has gotten right. The 13th Amendment is one of those things, and I'm not sure many people realize just how close this country was to not passing it for many more years. It gives you a whole new appreciation for the will of a few extraordinary men and their clarity of vision to pass such an historically significant piece of legislation in the face of tremendous bigotry.In Short:Spielberg takes a part of history and makes it more. What could have been a drab exercise in the telling of the passage of a bit of legislation is instead a front row seat at one of the most important moments in US history. The whole film is shown in an almost dreamlike quality and pulls the audience into a powerful script featuring an iconic performance and generally excellent ensemble cast. I really want Abraham Lincoln to tell me another story, but sadly he's dead going on 150 years now, so instead I'll give this a 9 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who can appreciate moments of historical significance.Exceptions to the recommendation:- anyone who would prefer to remain doomed to repeat history due to their lack of knowledge thereof;- states' rights advocates who would be

Far from it, in my humble opinion.  First, the direction provides no pacing, is self-indulgent and engages in far too many  loooong shots of scenes or faces when nothing is happening.  I had to keep reminding myself that this was done by Steven Spielberg but it did not match any of his earlier and justifiably praised work.  Second, the writing is just plain poor.  Tony Kushner made some decisions on emphasis, comments and other aspects that do nothing but add ponderousness and length to the film.  Third, while I've admired Daniel Day-Lewis in other work, here he doesn't act, doesn't emote and mumbles most of his lines.  An acting Oscar?  No way.  And I wouldn't vote for the person who glued on his whiskers or created his wig either - both patently unreal-looking.  There are far too many other characters; with all the costumes, various wig styles and incoherent script it is much too difficult to figure out who is who and doing what.  Tommy Lee Jones is identifiable but having the camera focus on the crags in his face does not equal acting.It all reminds me of the emperor's new clothes - people look at the naked emperor and see what they expect to see:  that he is clothed and bedecked.  In fact, he is naked.

1592651,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B009AMANBA,Brian Driver,"[10, 14]","NOTE: This review DOES NOT contain SPOILERS!Do you remember when you were a young student reading your history textbook and--while you had been up until that moment viewing artists' renditions of famous events and people--you were now in the latter half of the 19th century, and you'd reached the portion of your history text when there were actual photos of these events?In fact, staring at you from the page, is the face of Abraham Lincoln himself.If you do remember such a moment, you might be equally startled by the intimacy and immediacy of ""Lincoln,"" a stunning work of art that marries two of cinema's most powerful forces: Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day Lewis.  How is it that these two amazing legends have not worked together before?The power of this film is captured in the single word of the title; this is no ""The Man, The Myth, The Legend"" mythology...no sweeping panorama told in glorious panoramic cutaways.  No; it is the story of one man, and how this one man took on one cause, one battle, and fought the good fight away from the dirt and gunpowder of the battlefield, trading it in for the backrooms and chambers of an even more wicked Washington D.C.It is the story behind the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, banning slavery as an institution. It may puzzle modern-day viewers that such an amendment ever had to be written, but HOW it was passed is an amazing story well worth telling. (And it's practically impossible to avoid making parallels with today's President, his House of Representatives, and their conflicts.)""Lincoln"" is a stirring story, full of intrigue and intelligence, and you will be stirred by the emotional sway conveyed by the camera and the script.  Tony Kushner fashioned the screenplay from Doris Kearn Goodwin's extremely well-research and well-toldTeam of Rivals.  As one might expect, it is the story of how Lincoln was compelled to ""work"" Washington, how he was able to coerce the varied forces of a warring Union political jungle and make it bend to his will.But it is more than that, and it was this that I found most forceful: the WHY.  And while you think you know it--that it is against human dignity to hold another man's freedom under your thumb--you are of course correct, but also misjudging the ideal for the real, practicality of the amendment.  And when the President lays out his rationale to his cabinet--when he spells out the political REASONS behind the passage of this amendment--it is a stirring, shrewd, and spellbinding moment that is as insightful, intelligent, and (if it were to have failed) as frightening as they come.There were several moments within this movie that moved me like that: one was as tiny as a moment can be, though it occurred at a time that meant as much to American history as any one moment can, and it was simply this: Abraham Lincoln needed a message sent by telegraph, and he found two men in the communications room who were capable of such a thing.  After it was sent, the President of the United States sat with them and conversed, holding them in awe, all while he recounted a lesson he was once taught in math that followed him to this day.And that is the power of this ""Lincoln.""  It takes a great actor, and a great director, to put their considerable skills hard at work at stepping back and letting the man shine.I WAS those telegraph men, mesmerized by the man--Daniel Day Lewis makes him that real.  It is easy to lose oneself in the moment and believe you are sitting with the man.  It is his hard, worn face, his stooped shoulders, his often grim demeanor, his high, reedy voice, his gentle, intelligent eyes...it is all there in Lewis' portrayal.  And his mind...it is a mark of Lewis' portrait of the man that Lincoln's vaunted intelligence always shows through, and the same is true of his compassion.  It is an amazing thing Lewis and Spielberg have accomplished--a film that is stirring when it needs to be, harried and frazzled when it needs to be, and gentle and mindful of the human soul, ALWAYS.As is usual with his films, Spielberg is best when he sets the scene, brings the actor forward, does the grunt work, then steps back and lets the scene play out, mindful of details as minor as a tapping finger or a twinkle in an eye.  From what I have seen of the director's career (and that's just about every movie he's done) it appears that he stresses over every detail, then lets his people do their work, making sure his camera is there to capture every nuance of the moment.  His movies seem so alive, so frames so full of sight and sound that the film seems close to exploding with energy.  It's no different here in ""Lincoln"" than it was inJaws,Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition), or the dozens of films in between.As is also usual, the film is populated by great actors doing great work.  Sally Field's Mary Todd is a wonder, her ballyhooed ""madness"" evident, but in Field's hands it's more the anguish of a mother who has lost one son and fears the loss of another--and is powerless to protect either him or the husband she loves.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as Lincoln's son Robert Todd, was fine in the small but pivotal role as the son who wished not to be protected any longer from the war.But it is Tommy Lee Jones who really steals the frame each time he is present.  He is simply terrific as the bombastic and bewigged Thaddeus Stevens, an ardent abolitionist.  Other noted roles are filled by Hal Holbrook, James Spader, Jackie Earle Haley, S. Epatha Merkerson, Tim Blake Nelson, Bruce McGill, and there are almost countless others.What this film really left me with was the sense that I was there, and so was Lincoln, the man.  When the film ended--and despite its length it ended far too soon--I was struck by how much I would miss him.  And this...the accomplishment of creating a man out of the ether, is really the most remarkable achievement.  I will miss this man Lincoln, but I will always treasure Spielberg and Lewis for giving me this living, breathing man of history.",5,"A Living, Breathing Lincoln Like No Other",1358208000,"01 15,

1592660,A2X17SA4E8V3PU,B009AMANBA,Bstrassell0001,"[6, 9]","Who can't help but love Steven Spielberg? Spielberg, one of the most creative minds in Hollywood, has made films of high historical importance. After making films about World War II and the Holocaust, Spielberg has gone on to another high area of historical importance: Abraham Lincoln and Lincoln's last three months (with a little bit of his four years altogether) as President.The result is Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as our sixteenth and, as most people agree, most beloved President.As director, Steven Spielberg takes Day-Lewis and a powerful ensemble cast (most notably Sally Field, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and James Spader)on a ride back through time. Viewers are shown by Spielberg what was going on in the Civil War in early 1865 and, in the meanwhile, the House of Representatives as its members were in the process of deciding either for or against slavery. The stresses of President Lincoln around this time are shown, not only in his job, but also in his personal life, most notably with his wife Mary Todd (portrayed by Sally Field) and son Robert (portrayed by Joseph-Gordon Levitt). Viewers are given a ride inside of President Lincoln's mind, a mind of faith, humor, and sometimes darkness as it was and as it evolved through the most trying times of President Lincoln's life. As a Lincoln scholar, I can tell you that the way Spielberg documents all of these personal traits about President Lincoln--and the way that the personal traits appear themselves--are impeccably portrayed in both quality and quantity. Daniel Day-Lewis, even if his heritage is the polar opposite of President Lincoln's, brings the beautiful talent that we all know and love him for right into his performance as President Lincoln. Every mannerism of President Lincoln, every trait of President Lincoln, is present in Day-Lewis' performance of him.My only real beef to pick with Lincoln is the fact that it does not document the entire life of President Lincoln, which keeps it from (in my opinion) being the ultimate Lincoln biography (compared to the biographies that record all of President Lincoln's life). However, given how many limitations on time filmmakers have, I can't hold it against Spielberg.

1592669,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B009AMANBA,California Dreaming,"[0, 1]","I wasn't around when Lincoln was alive -- taking a peek at the Guinness World Record for the oldest human, it looks like no one else living today was -- but my guess while watching this film:  people back then weren't nearly as talkative as the players in this film.  After all, as I believe Lincoln even says during the first act:  ""I'm not really into politics myself.""  And politicians like to talk, while apolotical people tend to be less loquacious.  People back then were doers, not talkers.I have to admit, I'm not usually a fan of period pieces, as revisionists seemingly either try to not stomp on the graves of those in an earlier period, or they trounce on them and spit on them as well.  There are some exceptions, and one director that I think does a terrific job with period pieces:  Mel Gibson.  Yeah, I know that he's been the kicking boy du jour for surely more than a day.  But Mr. Gibson doesn't like to sugarcoat anything in any way in an unrealistic manner, and he seems to realize the fallibility of human nature, while at the same time showing some bit of dignity where he can and may.  (For those who are snarky, I'm sure that their real-mature response might be something like:  ""Takes one to know one."")Another trait of many of Mr. Gibson's films:  he wasn't afraid to use the native tongue of the people at the time, and add subtitles for the viewer.  Surely a risky move for particularly a US audience, but I always thought that there was a huge payoff because of this; it adds to the authenticity.  But here, while the players speak in English -- as you'd expect, since after all it is set in the United States -- most of the people didn't exactly have the accents that I would expect.  This still would have been, say, within 100 years of the Birth of America, and the living at that time weren't too far removed from the initial immigrants.  (I like the television show ""Sleepy Hollow,"" and the male lead in that film is far more convincing to me than anyone in this film.  Once again, I wasn't around back then, but my gut tells me ""Sleepy Hollow"" might be more accurate.)One other ""touchy"" subject, but not one you'd expect with this film:  many people, particularly those in the industry, are very afraid to ever criticize anything in which Steven Spielberg is involved.  ""Hogwash!"" I say, while adding, ""A work of art stands strictly on its own.""  Mr. Spielberg has had many successes, and he's had some big failures as well; I always believe that those that don't have big failures don't take enough risks, and I commend him for taking the risks that he does.  ""Jurassic Park"" excellent, ""Jurassic Park 2"" a dismal failure.  ""Indiana Jones"" awesome, ""Indiana Jones 2"" awful.While I'm not prepared to bucket ""Lincoln"" in with the failures listed above, I would say that it's surely not a huge success.  And the worst thing of all to me:  it's just not very interesting.

1592677,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B009AMANBA,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[1, 1]","There was a lot of anticipation about the release of Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln."" The book from which it was based, ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,"" was re-released, as well as documentaries and magazine articles. Lincoln was the flavor of the month in the media, and all the high expectations were well rewarded. ""Lincoln"" delivers and Spielberg has created another one for history. It is an impressive film that makes justice to the legend of what has been referred to as the best the president the United States of America has ever had.About the movie itself, let me just start by saying that what you watch is not the story of Lincoln's life, from the cabin days, his career as a lawyer, his political beginnings, and the like. Instead, what you witness is Lincoln during his final four months in office and his efforts to eradicate slavery and end the bloody Civil War. Hence, the story takes place mostly in the confines of Washington and its politicians. We find our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day Lewis), in a battle against time to pass the constitutional amendment to end slavery and, at the same time, preserve the peace between the north and the south after the war. It is 1965, and it is important to pass this amendment before the war ends, as to prevent the south to boycott it before it becomes law. To accomplish this, he needs the help of William Seward (David Strathairn), his Secretary of State, and Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), a smart and manipulative Republican who is heavily respected in congress. We witness Lincoln in the war room, making decisions and seeking advice on how to win the war and stop the killing, and also trying to buy key congressmen whose votes are needed to pass the amendment - wow, talk about lobbying! In addition, we watch how Lincoln deals with Mary Todd (Sally Field), his troubled, yet strong wife, as well as his sons Robert and Tad. It is nice to watch Lincoln spend some quality time with them, in such tense and dramatic days. There is also some time given to the assassination, but it is done in a different, surprising way. The ending was also well- handed, satisfying, and surprising as well.""Lincoln"" is a true gem, and I have to confess that I will probably have to watch it again, as the political plot and constitutional talk were hard to follow at times, and these are the important elements to understand the so-called genius of Lincoln. It is necessary to note that Spielberg was smart enough to place some African-American actors in some small, but key roles in the film.

1592684,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B009AMANBA,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[3, 5]","Tony Kushner, the pulitzer prize winning writer of ANGELS IN AMERICA has done it again.  He wrote an absolutely brilliant screenplay about Lincoln.  Ironically, he and director Steven Speilberg had a heck of a time getting Daniel Day-Lewis to play Lincoln, They were even down to saying, ""Have you ever looked in a mirror?"" Finally, he agreed and we are certainly the richer for it.  Day-Lewis for all intents and purposes IS Lincoln.  Everything I've ever read about Lincoln, he rolls into this performance from the homespun folksiness, to the country lawyer, to the storyteller, to the grieving father to the husband of a very difficult wife.  Mary Todd Lincoln is likewise impeccably recreated by Sally Field.So many things were unearthed in this film that I never fully appreciated before. Just some of these things follow.How in darkness people lived. Unless it is broad daylight and huge windows are open, everyone indoors lives in relative darkness compared to our electrically lit environs. This set the tone for me more than any other period recreation.  I just can't imagine living in that much darkness.No one is particularly attractive of either sex, despite a huge cast. It took me until the film was over to figure out why they were physically well below average.  It is that our eye has changed.  We have gotten used to people having ample access to cleaning and grooming supplies and aides of every sort. We also have medical attention which helps achieve a healthier glow.  It is not that anyone looks dirty precisely in this.  They just look a great deal scruffier and rougher all over and the man have full facial hair and either fairly ugly hair or wigs. I give Speilberg immense credit for pulling this look off as it really helps the auuthenticity.There were many aspects to the thirteenth amendment passage which I did not fully appreciate before. For example, the man on the street thought that passage of the amendment would bring about the end of the war. The war and the amendment were in fact two separate issues. Lincoln explains the legal problem if we win the war without the amendment though.  He, as commander in chief, will have to lay claim to all of the slaves in the South as the property of the USA as the spoils of war. This will happen because without the amendment, they will be legally considered chattels.The abolitionists were against the amendment because it did not go far enough. They wanted more than full legal equality for the blacks. They wanted to address areas other than the law. Tommy Lee Jones plays their lead person in the House and begins to falter over opposing the amendment as he realizes how many rights he would be giving up for blacks if it fails to pass. The abolitionists in any event were wrong as subsequent civil rights cases in the ensuing 150 years tackled one aspect of life after another where inequality was at play. The thirteenth amendment was critical in these cases.IN SUM THOUGH, let me repeat, Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely phenomenal. It is almost impossible to imagine that anyone could beat him for the Oscar.  It will be his third.",5,expected it to be a bit tedious but was FASCINATED; SUPERB!,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,3117,"['Tony', 'Kushner', 'pulitzer', 'prize', 'winning', 'writer', 'ANGELS', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'done', 'again', 'wrote', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'Lincoln', 'Ironically', 'director', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'had', 'heck', 'time', 'getting', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'play', 'Lincoln', 'were', 'even', 'down', 'saying', 'Have', 'ever', 'looked', 'mirror', 'Finally', 'agreed', 'are', 'certainly', 'richer', 'Day-Lewis', 'intents', 'purposes', 'IS', 'Lincoln', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'Lincoln', 'performance', 'homespun', 'folksiness', 'country', 'lawyer', 'storyteller', 'grieving', 'father', 'husband', 'very', 'difficult', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'likewise', 'impeccably', 'recreated', 'Sally', 'Field.So', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'unearthed', 'film', 'never', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'before', 'Just', 'things', 'follow.How', 'darkness', 'people', 'lived', 'broad', 'daylight', 'huge', 'windows', 'are', 'open', 'everyone', 'indoors', 'relative', 'darkness', 'compared', 'electrically', 'lit', 'environs', 'set', 'tone', 'more', 'other', 'period', 'recreation', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'living', 'much', 'darkness.No', 'one', 'particularly', 'attractive', 'sex', 'huge', 'cast', 'took', 'film', 'was', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'were', 'physically', 'well', 'average', 'eye', 'changed', 'have', 'gotten', 'used', 'people', 'having', 'ample', 'access', 'cleaning', 'grooming', 'supplies', 'aides', 'sort', 'also', 'have', 'medical', 'attention', 'achieve', 'healthier', 'glow', 'not', 'anyone', 'dirty', 'precisely', 'just', 'look', 'great', 'deal', 'scruffier', 'rougher', 'man', 'have', 'full', 'facial', 'hair', 'fairly', 'ugly', 'hair', 'wigs', 'give', 'Speilberg', 'immense', 'credit', 'pulling', 'look', 'off', 'really', 'auuthenticity.There', 'were', 'many', 'aspects', 'thirteenth', 'amendment', 'passage', 'did', 'not', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'before', 'example', 'man', 'street', 'thought', 'passage', 'amendment', 'would', 'bring', 'end', 'war', 'war', 'amendment', 'were', 'fact', 'two', 'separate', 'issues', 'Lincoln', 'legal', 'problem', 'win', 'war', 'amendment', 'commander', 'chief', 'will', 'have', 'lay', 'claim', 'slaves', 'South', 'property', 'USA', 'spoils', 'war', 'will', 'happen', 'because', 'amendment', 'will', 'be', 'legally', 'considered', 'chattels.The', 'abolitionists', 'were', 'amendment', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'wanted', 'more', 'full', 'legal', 'equality', 'blacks', 'wanted', 'address', 'areas', 'other', 'law', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'lead', 'person', 'House', 'falter', 'opposing', 'amendment', 'how', 'many', 'rights', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'up', 'blacks', 'pass', 'abolitionists', 'event', 'were', 'wrong', 'subsequent', 'civil', 'rights', 'cases', 'ensuing', '150', 'years', 'tackled', 'one', 'aspect', 'life', 'where', 'inequality', 'was', 'play', 'thirteenth', 'amendment', 'was', 'critical', 'cases.IN', 'SUM', 'THOUGH', 'let', 'repeat', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'almost', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'could', 'beat', 'Oscar', 'will', 'be', 'third']",N/A

He made the character so three dimensional. It was enthralling to see him play Lincoln so memorably. He really was ably supported because the other roles were played with so much verve and excitement. Everyone seemed to be really into playing their characters well. Tommy Lee Jones was simply great as Thaddeus Stevens, Sally Fields was a excellent Mary Todd, the three lobbyists were played by such wonderful character actors that they sprang completely to life.I wish Bruce McGill could have been used more somehow. I thought he was extremely convincing in his few scenes as Stanton. I was very moved by the scene of Stanton and Lincoln waiting for news from Fort Fisher and his reaction to Lincoln telling another story I thought was hilarious.Jackie Earle Haley was very good in his role as Alexander Stephens. I even thought he eerily resembled him. I also liked David Strathairn as Seward.Heck, this movie even had a great Tad portrayal in it! The scene of Lincoln and Tad at the very beginning is very, very moving. The final blowup between Robert Lincoln and Abraham is very startling in its intensity and well played by both actors. I thought relationship with his sons was one of highlights of the film.The scenes in the House of Representatives were superb showing the chaos of our Democratic system and that there never was really `good old days' when no one bitterly disagreed. That there was primal racism on the floor of the House of Representatives. Also, just try to tell these representatives to give women the right to vote! The lesson that is shown is the give and take that is needed to get something done with such a discordant legislative body.All of this greatness made me long for a `Band of Brothers' length miniseries on Lincoln with these actors.If a person is fascinated by America or American history the movie is truly a can't miss.",5,"Excellent, Excellent Lincoln film",1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,1972,"['was', 'highly', 'impressed', 'thought', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'was', 'superb', 'seemed', 'more', 'Lincoln', 'even', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'made', 'character', 'so', 'three', 'dimensional', 'was', 'enthralling', 'see', 'play', 'Lincoln', 'so', 'memorably', 'really', 'was', 'ably', 'supported', 'other', 'roles', 'were', 'played', 'so', 'much', 'verve', 'excitement', 'Everyone', 'seemed', 'be', 'really', 'playing', 'characters', 'well', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'was', 'simply', 'great', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'was', 'excellent', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'three', 'lobbyists', 'were', 'played', 'such', 'wonderful', 'character', 'actors', 'sprang', 'completely', 'life.I', 'wish', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'more', 'somehow', 'thought', 'was', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'few', 'scenes', 'Stanton', 'was', 'very', 'moved', 'scene', 'Stanton', 'Lincoln', 'waiting', 'news', 'Fort', 'Fisher', 'reaction', 'Lincoln', 'telling', 'story', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious.Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'Alexander', 'Stephens', 'even', 'thought', 'eerily', 'resembled', 'also', 'liked', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Seward.Heck', 'movie', 'even', 'had', 'great', 'Tad', 'portrayal', 'scene', 'Lincoln', 'Tad', 'very', 'beginning', 'very', 'very', 'moving', 'final', 'blowup', 'Robert', 'Lincoln', 'Abraham', 'very', 'startling', 'intensity', 'well', 'played', 'actors', 'thought', 'relationship', 'sons', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'film.The', 'scenes', 'House', 'Representatives', 'were', 'superb', 'showing', 'chaos', 'Democratic', 'system', 'never', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'one', 'bitterly', 'disagreed', 'was', 'primal', 'racism', 'floor', 'House', 'Representatives', 'Also', 'just', 'try', 'tell', 'representatives', 'give', 'women', 'right', 'vote', 'lesson', 'shown', 'give', 'take', 'needed', 'get', 'something', 'done', 'discordant', 'legislative', 'body.All', 'greatness', 'made', 'long', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'length', 'miniseries', 'Lincoln', 'actors.If', 'person', 'fascinated', 'America', 'American', 'history', 'movie', 'truly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss']",N/A

I think pretty highly of Steven Spielberg, especially in comparison to other directors' lack of skill and lack of concern about the moral effects of their movies.  From what I know about Lincoln, it is quite an accurate portrayal of him, and I think Daniel Day-Lewis indeed deserved that Best Actor Oscar.  But despite its amazing attention to historical detail in the sets, and that an actor was able to portray Lincoln's multifaceted personality really well, its MESSAGE felt lacking to me in two serious ways.  I wish, first, that the screenplay by Tony Kushner had not included all the profanity.  According to Civil War historian James McPherson, ""Lincoln rarely if ever used profanity, and some of the dialogue calls for him to do that. I thought that was a bit jarring.""  I did, too.  I think the script would've been pretty good if the profuse cussing had been left out.  But it also didn't go far enough in expressing Lincoln's deeply Biblical appreciation of the value of human life.  Lincoln's faith got a little treatment in the movie, but not as much as it should have, because that was what motivated his sense of justice.Summary:  Excellent acting, very engaging direction by Steven Spielberg, but the script was weak for such a momentous subject, due to its inadequate treatment of Lincoln's faith and in that it expressed an inaccurate impiety on Lincoln's part.  In a movie that's more like a play, which this movie is, pretty much everything depends on the script.

1592747,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B009AMANBA,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[6, 9]","This movie absolutely took my breath away. It was visually stunning, historically accurate to the extent that my husband repeatedly nudged me regarding a lot of very minute details, and was superbly acted. Did I forget to mention that the screen play which was based upon Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team Of Rivals took a huge amount of information and meaningfully compressed themes to tell an important story about the presidency of Abraham Lincoln and the abolition of slavery. This movie made me proud to be a born and raised Illinoisian and explains Lincoln reputation as a history significant president and a self-educated and brilliant man.Without summarizing this expansive movie in detail, I'm going to tell you why I just saw this movie at the theater for the second time and why I am buying a DVD of this film. There is too much in this movie to absorb in just one viewing. I don't mean this as a negative, but there were so many characters, so many opinions and sentiments expressed that I wondered if I got it all the first time around. Turns out I really missed nothing except the opportunity to fully appreciate the wonderful performances that were peppered with slight nuances that transformed the actors from acting to really becoming the characters. In a film populated with a huge cast of superb performers, this movie transported me to a different reality of nearly 150 years ago. I was sitting on the edge of my seat during this movie.Hearing Daniel Day Lewis speak made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. His demeanor, his gait, his gesturing, and his speech patterns and intonations all made me feel that I was seeing the real Lincoln. I don't think anyone would dispute Lewis' reputation as a versatile performer, but this role really was really difficult as far as I am concerned. Lewis' clearly must have done a huge amount of research on Lincoln to play a historical figure that is legendary but who we never heard.Sally Field had the southern gentility and nervous demeanor I would have expected and looked quite a bit like Mary Todd Lincoln without resorting to obvious trickery. Field's portrayal managed to give depth  to a historical figure that has often been written off as a crazy lady. Brilliant casting despite the criticisms that Sally Field was too old to portray Mary.Tommy Lee Jones was amazing down to the limp dragging leg and ill-fitting wig as Thaddeus Stevens. While beefier looking than the real Stevens, he portrayed Stevens as quick witted, clever and king of one-liners he was reputed to be. There was a nice offset between Lincoln and Stevens who were fundamentally very different people in terms of demeanor as well as motives. In fact, Jones' Stevens did a formidable job of crankily eating up all of his opponents and spitting them out. Leaves me in a state of wonder as to just how good an actor Jones is and how often it seems he is undervalued as an actor.From the acting, to the sets, costuming, make-up, and visuals this movie is incredible.I sat on the edge of my seat both times I saw this movie. I didn't make any rushes to the concession stand or rest room despite its rather long running time.I know that recommending a DVD of this movie that I have yet to see is jumping the gun and probably not the best reason to recommend it.

The direction is mostly solid but the weakness, it's obvious with so much attention put on it, is the script. The thing drags a bit and at times we see just a little too much sentimentality in this one.

1592753,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B009AMANBA,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[4, 5]","The subject of many films over the decades, Abraham Lincoln has been portrayed to great effect by such top actors as Raymond Massey, Henry Fonda, and on TV by Hal Holbrook.  Steven Spielberg has assembled a great cast headed by Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, a chronicle of the last weeks of his presidency and his final important accomplishment before he was assassinated.  As a slice of history, it is a fascinating insight into the political challenges that went into the 13th Amendment. As a portrayal of a historic figure, it could not be any better.In January, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln (Lewis) has been just re-elected and must contend with major issues particularly the ongoing toll of the Civil War.  Amid the inequality of the `colored' soldiers and a growing personal conviction that was marked by his landmark Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Lincoln is passionate about getting the 13th Amendment (which would unequivocally free all slaves) passed in Congress.  At odds with his headstrong wife, Mary Todd (Sally Field), and surrounded by a doubting cabinet and strange bedfellows, Lincoln's challenge is to secure enough votes in Congress amid powerful opposition.  With the potential of a Confederate signal for an end to the war, Lincoln must weigh the political fallout of ending a costly conflict and achieving lasting freedom for all Americans.Lincoln is not intended as an all encompassing biography but rather a microscope into the President's last great act of his administration, and it illustrates his sheer will and unshakable faith. It demonstrates his disarming sense of humor and philosophy, and he is depicted as an imperfect human whose relationships are depicted as often dysfunctional whether it is with his paranoid wife Mary Todd over the loss of deceased son or his rebellious older son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).Unwilling to compromise on his beliefs, Lincoln realizes that his legacy will be tied to this moment forever.  It is revealing how the political challenges in Congress are dealt with in bold strokes or subtle, delicate wording.  His battles with Congress have direct parallels with the current political climate.Lincoln had the foresight to look ahead and anticipate his legacy and how the world will look on to this moment in history including the proposed Reconstruction of the South once hostilities ceased.  The behind the scenes cajoling and arm twisting make for an interesting insight into the political process. As the momentous day for the important vote arrives, each congressman places his vote in a manner not unlike the founding fathers of 1776.Daniel Day-Lewis has become the Paul Muni of our generation.  By being selective with his roles, he has played larger than life period figures that have transcended their respective films.  He inhabits this role perfectly, and the makeup work and vocal inflections are outstanding.  When the war winds down and has taken an emotional toll on Lincoln, you see the President's line worn face.Sally Field is the perfect foil as Mary Todd, his opinionated wife.  Tommy Lee Jones is a standout in an impressive cast of well known actors (including Holbrook as an influential citizen).  His Thaddeus Stevens, whose support was instrumental in Congress, is an intimidating figure with an imposing demeanor.  He gets some of the best lines.  James Spader makes a fine, slimy operative for Seward, who is played with stern conviction by David Strathairn.  Spielberg consistently gives a slave's point of view to put things in perspective. The war and the amendment are seen through the eyes of former slaves particularly Gloria Reuben's servant to Mrs. Lincoln.The film is magnificently shot by Janusz Kaminski in a manner that emulates the iconic pictures of the period.  You feel at times that you are witness to actual, historic events.  We don't actually see much of the Civil War battles but rather the aftermath in the bodies and limbs that are testimonials to the horror of warfare.  Indeed, such themes recur in Spielberg films depicting World War I (War Horse) and World War II (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Empire of the Sun).There is a certain reverence and awe when you watch this film because the details are recreated vividly.  Tony Kushner's screenplay is the blueprint that enables Spielberg to add to a body of work that contains some of the best documentations of American history (Amistad).  There will be future film versions on the life of this remarkable historic figure, but it is difficult to imagine a better impersonation, period.",5,LINCOLN Comes Alive,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,4574,"['subject', 'many', 'films', 'decades', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'been', 'portrayed', 'great', 'effect', 'such', 'top', 'actors', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'TV', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'assembled', 'great', 'cast', 'headed', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Lincoln', 'chronicle', 'last', 'weeks', 'presidency', 'final', 'important', 'accomplishment', 'was', 'assassinated', 'slice', 'history', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'political', 'challenges', 'went', '13th', 'Amendment', 'portrayal', 'historic', 'figure', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'better.In', 'January', '1865', 'President', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Lewis', 'been', 'just', 're-elected', 'must', 'contend', 'major', 'issues', 'particularly', 'ongoing', 'toll', 'Civil', 'War', 'inequality', 'colored', 'soldiers', 'growing', 'personal', 'conviction', 'was', 'marked', 'landmark', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', '1863', 'Lincoln', 'passionate', 'getting', '13th', 'Amendment', 'would', 'unequivocally', 'free', 'slaves', 'passed', 'Congress', 'odds', 'headstrong', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Sally', 'Field', 'surrounded', 'doubting', 'cabinet', 'strange', 'bedfellows', 'Lincoln', 'challenge', 'secure', 'enough', 'votes', 'Congress', 'powerful', 'opposition', 'potential', 'Confederate', 'signal', 'end', 'war', 'Lincoln', 'must', 'weigh', 'political', 'fallout', 'ending', 'costly', 'conflict', 'achieving', 'lasting', 'freedom', 'Americans.Lincoln', 'not', 'intended', 'encompassing', 'biography', 'rather', 'microscope', 'President', 'last', 'great', 'act', 'administration', 'sheer', 'will', 'unshakable', 'faith', 'disarming', 'sense', 'humor', 'philosophy', 'depicted', 'imperfect', 'human', 'relationships', 'are', 'depicted', 'often', 'dysfunctional', 'paranoid', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'loss', 'deceased', 'son', 'rebellious', 'older', 'son', 'Robert', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', '.Unwilling', 'compromise', 'beliefs', 'Lincoln', 'legacy', 'will', 'be', 'tied', 'moment', 'forever', 'revealing', 'how', 'political', 'challenges', 'Congress', 'are', 'dealt', 'bold', 'strokes', 'subtle', 'delicate', 'wording', 'battles', 'Congress', 'have', 'direct', 'parallels', 'current', 'political', 'climate.Lincoln', 'had', 'foresight', 'look', 'ahead', 'anticipate', 'legacy', 'how', 'world', 'will', 'look', 'moment', 'history', 'including', 'proposed', 'Reconstruction', 'South', 'once', 'hostilities', 'ceased', 'scenes', 'cajoling', 'arm', 'twisting', 'make', 'interesting', 'insight', 'political', 'process', 'momentous', 'day', 'important', 'vote', 'arrives', 'congressman', 'vote', 'manner', 'not', 'founding', 'fathers', '1776.Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'become', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'generation', 'being', 'selective', 'roles', 'played', 'larger', 'life', 'period', 'figures', 'have', 'transcended', 'respective', 'films', 'role', 'perfectly', 'makeup', 'work', 'vocal', 'inflections', 'are', 'outstanding', 'When', 'war', 'down', 'taken', 'emotional', 'toll', 'Lincoln', 'see', 'President', 'line', 'worn', 'face.Sally', 'Field', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'opinionated', 'wife', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'standout', 'impressive', 'cast', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'including', 'Holbrook', 'influential', 'citizen', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'support', 'was', 'instrumental', 'Congress', 'intimidating', 'figure', 'imposing', 'demeanor', 'best', 'lines', 'James', 'Spader', 'fine', 'slimy', 'operative', 'Seward', 'who', 'played', 'stern', 'conviction', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Spielberg', 'consistently', 'slave', 'point', 'view', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'war', 'amendment', 'are', 'seen', 'eyes', 'former', 'slaves', 'particularly', 'Gloria', 'Reuben', 'servant', 'Mrs.', 'Lincoln.The', 'film', 'magnificently', 'shot', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'manner', 'iconic', 'pictures', 'period', 'feel', 'times', 'are', 'witness', 'actual', 'historic', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'much', 'Civil', 'War', 'battles', 'rather', 'aftermath', 'bodies', 'limbs', 'are', 'testimonials', 'horror', 'warfare', 'Indeed', 'such', 'themes', 'recur', 'Spielberg', 'films', 'depicting', 'World', 'War', 'War', 'Horse', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Empire', 'Sun', 'certain', 'reverence', 'awe', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'details', 'are', 'recreated', 'vividly', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'screenplay', 'blueprint', 'Spielberg', 'add', 'body', 'work', 'best', 'documentations', 'American', 'history', 'Amistad', 'will', 'be', 'future', 'film', 'versions', 'life', 'remarkable', 'historic', 'figure', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'better', 'impersonation', 'period']",N/A

1592758,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B009AMANBA,DanD,"[1, 2]","Instead of giving us the expanse of Abraham Lincoln's life (which could arguably fill several films), we get here a small slice: the passage of the 13th amendment, outlawing slavery.  This is a smart movie: it gives director Steven Spielberg a focus (which he sorely needs), and keeps the film from meandering all over the place.LINCOLN is truly an actor's piece.  In the lead role, Daniel Day-Lewis is predictably flawless; his rendition of Lincoln is so thorough, the immediate effect is a little underwhelming; it's only after the screen goes dark that you realize you've witnessed such an amazing transformation/performance.  More immediately enjoyable are some of the supporting roles, particularly Tommy Lee Jones as the outspoken Thaddeus Stevens; Sally Field, as Lincoln's troubled spouse; David Straitharn as Lincoln's contentious Secretary of State William Seward; David Costabile, as one of Lincoln's groundlings; Jackie Earle Healey as Confederate VP Alexander Stephens; and Jared Harris as a simmering Ulysses S. Grant.  We also get, in less fleshed-out roles (the script doesn't give them much to do, unfortunately), a who's who of character actors: Joseph Gordon-Levitt; Hal Holbrook; James Spader; Bruce McGill; Tim Blake Nelson; John Hawkes; and others.  The supporting cast flits in and out; most of the performances are believable and top-notch, even when the script falters.And falter it does.  Tony Kershner has written a good script; the only problem is, it's not as impressive at its real-life subject matter.  Everything Lincoln says seems weighted with meaning; Day-Lewis understands what Lincoln was going for--a story or joke to lighten the mood, even if it has the opposite effect--but Spielberg and Kershner want every word this president says to mean something important.  The effect is didactic and off-putting; where we and the cast simply want the story to be about the characters, it suddenly becomes and morality.  We get it: this was an important time in American history.  There can be no disputing that.  But the audience is well aware of the importance; the film's true goal should've been--and, in a few spots, is--the characters involved in that moment.  Day-Lewis anchors the film with his heartfelt portrayal; but if LINCOLN had eschewed politics and focused a tad more on character, this could've been a 5-star movie, easily.  As is, you should definitely watch it; but you might not enjoy it as much as you would have otherwise.",4,How to make a historical biopic.,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,2473,"['Instead', 'giving', 'expanse', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'could', 'arguably', 'fill', 'several', 'films', 'get', 'here', 'small', 'slice', 'passage', '13th', 'amendment', 'outlawing', 'slavery', 'smart', 'movie', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'focus', 'sorely', 'film', 'meandering', 'place.LINCOLN', 'truly', 'actor', 'piece', 'lead', 'role', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'predictably', 'flawless', 'rendition', 'Lincoln', 'so', 'thorough', 'immediate', 'effect', 'little', 'underwhelming', 'only', 'screen', 'dark', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'amazing', 'transformation/performance', 'More', 'immediately', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'supporting', 'roles', 'particularly', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'outspoken', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Lincoln', 'troubled', 'spouse', 'David', 'Straitharn', 'Lincoln', 'contentious', 'Secretary', 'State', 'William', 'Seward', 'David', 'Costabile', 'one', 'Lincoln', 'groundlings', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Healey', 'Confederate', 'VP', 'Alexander', 'Stephens', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'simmering', 'Ulysses', 'S.', 'Grant', 'also', 'get', 'less', 'fleshed-out', 'roles', 'script', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'do', 'unfortunately', 'who', 'who', 'character', 'actors', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'James', 'Spader', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'others', 'supporting', 'cast', 'flits', 'most', 'performances', 'are', 'believable', 'top-notch', 'even', 'when', 'script', 'falters.And', 'falter', 'Tony', 'Kershner', 'written', 'good', 'script', 'only', 'problem', 'not', 'impressive', 'real-life', 'subject', 'matter', 'Everything', 'Lincoln', 'weighted', 'meaning', 'Day-Lewis', 'what', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'going', 'story', 'joke', 'lighten', 'mood', 'even', 'opposite', 'effect', 'Spielberg', 'Kershner', 'want', 'word', 'president', 'mean', 'something', 'important', 'effect', 'didactic', 'off-putting', 'where', 'cast', 'simply', 'want', 'story', 'be', 'characters', 'suddenly', 'morality', 'get', 'was', 'important', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'can', 'be', 'disputing', 'audience', 'well', 'aware', 'importance', 'film', 'true', 'goal', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'few', 'spots', 'characters', 'involved', 'moment', 'Day-Lewis', 'anchors', 'film', 'heartfelt', 'portrayal', 'LINCOLN', 'had', 'eschewed', 'politics', 'focused', 'tad', 'more', 'character', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', '5-star', 'movie', 'easily', 'As', 'should', 'definitely', 'watch', 'might', 'not', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise']",N/A
1592759,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,B009AMANBA,Daniel A. Brown,"[25, 37]","Although ""Lincoln"" takes place over the space of its final four months, this is not a Civil War movie in that there are only two battlefield scenes. And as graphic and grisly as they are, both are rendered superfluous. The film, instead, focuses on the president's need to ram the 13th Amendment banning slavery through the recalcitrant House of Representatives before the Civil War comes to an end.As such, ""Lincoln"" is the antithesis of an ""action"" film which might explain why the audience I viewed it with contained few, if anyone, under the age of 40. Instead, its core power comes from scenes of people talking, discussing, and in many cases shouting. Mid-19th century America was a crude, raucous arena and the most exciting scenes take place on the floor of the House where members regularly heckle, browbeat and insult each other. In fact, the eloquent verbal savaging of one's political opponent is so lively that had C-SPAN existed then, it would be the most entertaining channel on television.One of the joys of ""Lincoln"" is that you are so immersed in the time period, that it is difficult to leave the theater afterwards without getting disoriented. You can feel the mustiness of the furnishings, the chill in the meagerly heated White House, and the constrictions of the clothing. Politics is a game so corrupt that the bribing and manipulating of politicians is openly accepted and Honest Abe is not averse to playing it to get the votes needed to pass the amendment. Ever the lawyer, he knows that the Emancipation Proclamation is not legally binding and that the eventually reunited Southern states will not heed it. Hence, the war can end with a Union victory with slavery still a fact of life below the Mason-Dixon Line.The passing of this landmark addition to the Constitution is always in doubt. The racism of the era is unflinchingly demonstrated, one of the core scenes being when fire-breathing abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens (an acerbically delightful Tommy Lee Jones) cannot avow on the House floor that all men are indeed, ""created equal"", knowing that such a radical declaration will alienate the swing votes.  The idea that black Americans (and all women might) someday get the vote is met with outcries of rage and disbelief.  It is a deal with the Devil that Stevens makes and he knows it.Much has been made of the acting of Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role and it is indeed a tour-de-force. Midway through, you forget it is an actor you are seeing instead of the actual personage. His Lincoln is sensitive, melancholy, profane, at times riled and always funny as hell, ready at the drop of the hat with a story or tall tale, most laced with R-rated language. Gangly and awkward, were he to run for office today, he wouldn't survive the first primary. Give Day-Lewis the Best Actor Oscar now and save us the ceremony.But I would give a Best Supporting Actress nod to Sally Field who fought for her role as Mary Lincoln. This sad woman, plagued by depression and migraine headaches, devastated by the loss of her son, Willy, is a study in iron tragedy. She both loves and hates her husband for his exalted occupation and his aloofness and the scenes where they argue over their children, both living and dead, have a poignant immediacy.

1592760,APC8SNF9U2W5W,B009AMANBA,DANIEL,"[2, 2]","For those who are not students of history, the 13th Amendment was one of those tests of a country, a moral test, if you will.  And so it was that on January 31, 1865, by a vote of 119 to 56, the Amendment passed ending slavery in America.  All but 4 Democrats abstained or voted against it, while every Republican voted for it.  Even Wikipedia does not mention that fact.  It&#8217;s not the first time Republicans have been at the front of the fight for equal rights while Democrats tried to block their efforts (check the Civil Right Amendment in 1964).Perhaps, to me, the most amusing moment in the film was the floor debate on what this amendment would lead to&#8212;Blacks being able to vote? Or even &#8230; dare I say&#8230;votes for women???  This latter suggestion evoked even greater horror among the congressmen of both parties than the amendment itself.This film is a &#8220;must see&#8221;, every bit as important as &#8220;The Help&#8221; or &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird&#8221;.  But it&#8217;s more than just an historical film, as Spielberg tries to give us a personal glimpse into the type of man who led the country through it&#8217;s darkest hour since the Revolutionary War.  The political ramifications of that time period are much more complex than generally known.  It&#8217;s a history lesson in a bottle, and I hope the popularity of this film will ensure that many in America, young and old, will experience it firsthand.  As late as 1857, just a few years before Lincoln, the U.S. Supreme Court declared slaves were property, not persons, and had no constitutional protections.  America was late in ending slavery: Mexico declared it abolished in 1810, the Dutch in 1814, England in 1834, and Sweden in 1847, just to name a few.  So this world-wide tide had to be something Americans felt washing over them during the middle of the 19th century.This film is truly a first string effort with Kathleen Kennedy producing, Steven Spielberg directing, and music by John Williams.  You may not know Joanna Johnston, who did the costume design, but you have certainly seen all the blockbusters she has worked on.  In short, this is the Oscar nomination club.  And starring such heavyweights as Daniel Day Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, David Strathairn (portraying William Seward&#8212;the same Seward who got us Alaska for 2 cents an acre), and Hal Holbrook (who I first saw in &#8220;3 Days of the Condor&#8221;), how could you go wrong?  In short, I always try to let you know when a movie will be on the short list for many Academy Awards, and this is just such a movie.Let&#8217;s start with Daniel Day Lewis.  I have not liked him in every role, but his performance here is noteworthy.  That being said, I can certainly understand how some might say the portrayal edges on boring.  But that&#8217;s what Lincoln was&#8212;a shy, soft-spoken, witty, deeply troubled man who aged a full lifetime during the four years of horror that cost his country almost 600,000 men.  To put that in perspective, it would take the World War I, World War II and Vietnam losses combined to equal that figure.  The stakes were high, not just for those in slavery, but for the geographic and political future of America.  Try to picture, if you can, two separate countries with a border right across the middle of what we now call the United States.  Lewis seems to capture the essence of Lincoln, right down to the awkward gait and his shy, eye contact avoiding mannerisms.Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln was good, but not great.  She&#8217;s one of my favorite actors, but her screen time is a bit short to really get into the character.  To make up for that, or perhaps because of her on screen presence, the scenes that are included seem to ramp up too quickly, as if we are cramming for a final.  One notable exception is the extended scene in which she and Lincoln fight about whether to allow their son to enlist and her moment in the receiving line when she delivers a bit of vitriol toward Representative Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones).  I read that it was not Lincoln who threatened to commit her to an asylum, but her son Robert who actually did it.Tommy Lee really shines in this movie, but he shines in every movie.  His portrayal of a staunch abolitionist congressman was heartwarming and funny.  He&#8217;s a master of conveying pages of drama with one close-up shot of his expression.  There&#8217;s a nice surprise right at the end of the movie regarding the reason for his passion against slavery.  I found the debates on the floor of the house, and the efforts of W.N. Bilbo (well played by James Spader) to &#8216;procure&#8217; the votes of hold-out Democrats to be very entertaining.Though not seen until the end of the movie, Jared Harris as Ulysses S. Grant also stands out in my mind for special recognition.  He makes a lot out of a little, and his final moments with Lincoln are moving.This is an historical piece, so there are no spoilers in telling you about the history itself, but there would be in discussing how that history came to be.  So I will let you see the story for yourself, and give you just enough to make you want to pay for a full price ticket.  I don&#8217;t believe you will be disappointed, but keeping some of my dispassionate perspective, I will not argue with those who might find the movie to be a bit slow and a bit long.  Could this have been edited down about 30 minutes?  Maybe.  Could some of the scenes with Mary Todd Lincoln have been shortened or eliminated?  At 150 minutes, the film is not too long, but it&#8217;s close.  Speaking personally, I never looked at my watch and was engaged in the film from start to finish, but then, I have a better than average attention span (after all, I sat through Muskateers!)The subject of Lincoln has been extensively documented in films and books, and whether you are a history buff or don&#8217;t know much about the 16th President outside of school assignments, this movie is worthy of your time and money.",5,A great study of a man we all think we know,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,6019,"['who', 'are', 'not', 'students', 'history', '13th', 'Amendment', 'was', 'one',

1592765,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B009AMANBA,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[43, 71]","I really wanted to love ""Lincoln."" I was hoping for a biopic that would be both intimate and spectacular. I wanted the film to sweep me away and bring me close to an historical figure in the way that ""A Man for All Seasons"" allowed audiences to feel close to Sir Thomas More, or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" created an unforgettable impression of T. E. Lawrence. I was hoping at least for a film as good as John Ford's ""Young Mr. Lincoln.""Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" felt more like an educational docudrama than a gripping feature film. Daniel Day-Lewis, though, gives a commanding performance as Lincoln. You should see the film. It is good. It's just not anywhere near good enough.It's hard to believe that Steven Spielberg, one of the most successful and influential Hollywood directors of all time, could have made a film so plodding and wooden. Scriptwriter Tony Kushner is a Pulitzer-prize winner. I would have to guess that Mr. Kushner did not win that prize for crafting gripping, dramatic scripts charged with dramatic tension and driven by character-revealing plot.The film is entitled ""Lincoln"" but it would be more aptly titled ""The Passing of the 13th Amendment Outlawing Slavery."" This shift of focus may have been done to make the film ""relevant.""It's a high school English class truism that the main character of a story is the one who changes. Abraham Lincoln does not change in this film. In many scenes, he feels like a statue in the corner. Lincoln deputizes WN Bilbo (James Spader) to hustle up the necessary votes. Spader is terrific as Bilbo, and he almost steals the movie. It's Bilbo who is moving and shaking. Lincoln just hangs back and comes out with a quip or bon mot or folksy, homespun tale or spooky prophetic dream every now and then. Heck, the animatronic Lincoln at Disneyland could do everything that Spielberg and Kushner allow their Lincoln to do.Sally Field is too old to play Mary Todd Lincoln, who was in her forties at the time, with a young son. In her every scene, all I kept thinking was, ""So, how is Sally Field doing as Mary Todd Lincoln?"" I was never able to forget that it was Field I was looking at, never able to escape the fact that I was watching a film rather than being immersed in a story.Many of the actors seem to have a hard time delivering Kushner's lengthy sentences. There is a scene where Mary Todd Lincoln is, in a long-winded manner, telling off Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) at a formal dinner, and it is so stiff it feels like a high school production. Daniel Day-Lewis never has this problem with the dialogue.David Strathairn is terrific as William Seward, Lincoln's secretary of state. He and DDL are utterly convincing in their scenes together. You really get a sense that these are two political partners with differing styles who are struggling as best they can toward a common goal - ending slavery. At one point Lincoln grievously disappoints Seward, and he dismisses Seward by remarking, ""Time is a great thickener of things."" Seward's response is priceless. The movie comes to life at that moment. It is depicting a vital but trouble relationship, how that relationship vents its anger, how it heals its wounds, how it struggles onward toward a hoped-for goal. If more time had been devoted to Lincoln and Seward's relationship, ""Lincoln"" would have been a better film.Tommy Lee Jones delivers the biting insults of Thaddeus Stevens, Pennsylvania congressman and chairman of the House Ways and Means committee. Stevens' insults, and his ridiculous wig, and Tommy Lee Jones' persona and voice, are so striking that Stevens almost becomes a caricature. He bellows that another house member is a reptile too low to step upon. The film doesn't get beyond that. It doesn't bring us into the mind of a white man courageous enough to battle slavery. There is a great, brave, brief scene where Lincoln and Stevens speak face-to-face and one-on-one. Stevens talks about his contempt for the common man. How could such a contemptuous person fight for human dignity? It's a conundrum the film doesn't plumb. Lincoln responds to Stevens with a terrific metaphor about compasses and swamps. Again, if there had been more of this kind of intelligent, challenging, and focused dialogue, this would have been a better film.My major disappointment with this film is that it didn't bring me any closer to Lincoln. There is something about Lincoln that defies the limitations of his time and place, and, therefore, understanding of him. He is truly larger than life. In the many photos of him, we see a compelling but inaccessible man. His features, with their marked facial asymmetry, grip and confound us - they invite, and resist, intimacy. He married a woman rumored to be mad. He was rumored to be a homosexual. He was martyred on Good Friday and it is said he haunts the White House. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance made me feel close to Lincoln, but the plot and direction didn't support that. I left disappointed.The production values are lavish. Scenes are chock-a-block with authentic, accurate, books, costumes, boot buckles, mustache combs, clay jugs, corsets, wallpaper. You almost get a whiff of the stale air of a museum. I look forward to watching the extra-feature-packed DVD that will include a chart with little arrows pointing to each object and offering its provenance, age, and construction materials.",3,A Disappointment.

1592773,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B009AMANBA,David A. Wend,"[3, 6]","For all of the fine films made about Abraham Lincoln over the years, Steven Speilberg's Lincoln presents us with, arguable, the finest film portrait.  The focus of the film is the pivotal last four months of Lincoln's life, the culmination of the civil war and the search for a way to heal the divided country.  The main focus of the film is the passage of the 13th amendment to end slavery.  However, there are other struggles in film in Lincoln's personal life (focusing on his son Robert's (sensitively played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt0) desire to become a soldier) and the president's feelings on the terrible losses of the war and the question of how to proceed with the place of the freed slaves and how to bring the divided nation back together. Although a narrow focus, Lincoln gives us a full portrait of Abraham Lincoln.Daniel Day-Lewis has given us a very human Abraham Lincoln displaying his humor, his political acumen and his family tragedies.  He also seems a tired man, weary after four years of war that he seen a level of destruction and casualties on an unprecedented level.  Mr. Day-Lewis brings Lincoln to life showing him playing political hardball with the Southern delegation and attempting to deal with his emotions as he deals with family issues.  Sally Field gave a full and convincing portrait of Mary Lincoln, still distraught after the death of their young son Willie but able to insult Thaddeus Stevens at a White House reception.Equally astonishing is the part Thaddeus Stevens plays in the passage of the 13th amendment (marvelously portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones).  Stevens is a firebrand politician, violently abolitionist who come s around to compromise to see the amendment passed.  Mr. Jones brings real passion to his portrayal of Stevens, and for all of his hardness we also see the softer side of Stevens when he takes the House copy of the amendment home to show to his ""housekeeper."" The turbulent politics of the period are well represented in the debate in the House of Representative that becomes a lesson in civics for us all.  This is well represented by the trio of arm-twisters hired by Secretary of State Seward to ensure there are enough Democrat votes.  The trio actors often played with great humor by John Hawkes, James Spader and Tim Blake Nelson show us how things are done in the 1860's.The large supporting cast for Lincoln have some truly memorable performances.  Secretary of State William Seward is beautifully played by David Strathairn,  Lincoln's secretary John Nicolay is sensitively portrayed by Jeremy Strong) and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton is memorably played by Bruce McGill especially when he snaps at Lincoln, ""No, you're not going to tell a story.  I can't bear to hear one.""Mr. Spielberg recreates the period so very well.  The White House and other Washington venues were painstakingly recreated.  Lincoln's office was re-created with painstaking accuracy.  Much credit is owed to the production designer (Rick Carter) and costume designer (Joanna Johnson) for turning back the clock.  The costume designers and the actors themselves convincingly conducted themselves as people from the period with their look and manners.  Some of the reviews I have read prefer the mini-series to this film as being a more complete portrait of Lincoln.  I think the film needs to be appreciated and judged on its own merits.  A film is a limited form of communication where an hours long television series can afford details.  There may be events and anecdotes some feel needed to be included but this does not limit the power of Lincoln.",5,A Powerful Film Portait,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,3598,"['fine', 'films', 'made', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'years', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'Lincoln', 'arguable', 'finest', 'film', 'portrait', 'focus', 'film', 'pivotal', 'last', 'four', 'months', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'culmination', 'civil', 'war', 'search', 'way', 'heal', 'divided', 'country', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'passage', '13th', 'amendment', 'end', 'slavery', 'However', 'are', 'other', 'struggles', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'personal', 'life', 'focusing', 'son', 'Robert', 'sensitively', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt0', 'desire', 'become', 'soldier', 'president', 'feelings', 'terrible', 'losses', 'war', 'question', 'how', 'proceed', 'place', 'freed', 'slaves', 'how', 'bring', 'divided', 'nation', 'back', 'together', 'narrow', 'focus', 'Lincoln', 'full', 'portrait', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln.Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'given', 'very', 'human', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'displaying', 'humor', 'political', 'acumen', 'family', 'tragedies', 'also', 'tired', 'man', 'weary', 'four', 'years', 'war', 'seen', 'level', 'destruction', 'casualties', 'unprecedented', 'level', 'Mr.', 'Day-Lewis', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'showing', 'playing', 'political', 'hardball', 'Southern', 'delegation', 'attempting', 'deal', 'emotions', 'family', 'issues', 'Sally', 'Field', 'gave', 'full', 'convincing', 'portrait', 'Mary', 'Lincoln', 'still', 'distraught', 'death', 'young', 'son', 'Willie', 'able', 'insult', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'White', 'House', 'reception.Equally', 'astonishing', 'part', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'passage', '13th', 'amendment', 'marvelously', 'portrayed', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Stevens', 'firebrand', 'politician', 'violently', 'abolitionist', 'who', 'come', 's', 'compromise', 'see', 'amendment', 'passed', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'real', 'passion', 'portrayal', 'Stevens', 'hardness', 'also', 'see', 'softer', 'side', 'Stevens', 'when', 'House', 'copy', 'amendment', 'home', 'show', 'housekeeper', 'turbulent', 'politics', 'period', 'are', 'well', 'represented', 'debate', 'House', 'Representative', 'lesson', 'civics', 'well', 'represented', 'trio', 'arm-twisters', 'hired', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Seward', 'ensure', 'are', 'enough', 'Democrat', 'votes', 'trio', 'actors', 'often', 'played', 'great', 'humor', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'James', 'Spader', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'show', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'done', ""1860's.The"", 'large', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Lincoln', 'have', 'truly', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Secretary', 'State', 'William', 'Seward', 'beautifully', 'played', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Lincoln', 'secretary', 'John', 'Nicolay', 'sensitively', 'portrayed', 'Jeremy', 'Strong', 'Secretary', 'War', 'Edwin', 'Stanton', 'memorably', 'played', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'especially', 'when', 'Lincoln', 'No', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'hear', 'one.', 'Mr', 'Spielberg', 'period', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'White', 'House', 'other', 'Washington', 'venues', 'were', 'painstakingly', 'recreated', 'Lincoln', 'office', 'was', 're-created', 'painstaking', 'accuracy', 'Much', 'credit', 'owed', 'production', 'designer', 'Rick', 'Carter', 'costume', 'designer', 'Joanna', 'Johnson', 'turning', 'back', 'clock', 'costume', 'designers', 'actors', 'convincingly', 'conducted', 'people', 'period', 'look', 'manners', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'prefer', 'mini-series', 'film', 'being', 'more', 'complete', 'portrait', 'Lincoln', 'think', 'film', 'be', 'appreciated', 'judged', 'own', 'merits', 'film', 'limited', 'form', 'communication', 'where', 'hours', 'long', 'television', 'series', 'can', 'afford', 'details', 'may', 'be', 'events', 'feel', 'needed', 'be', 'included', 'not', 'limit', 'power', 'Lincoln']",N/A
1592774,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B009AMANBA,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","The scene in the film that stands out to me is where Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) is conversing with a pair of young telegraph operators.  They wonder if whether the times we are born in are randomly selected or if we are deliberately chosen for a specific moment in time.  Lincoln then goes on to expound on a theory of the philosopher Euclid.  If two things are equal to another thing would they not be equal to one another?  There are many such moments that define this magnificent film.  My brother felt it was when one of Lincoln's war secretaries storms out of the room not willing to subject himself to Lincoln spinning another analogous tall tale. My wife fell asleep(?!).  ""Lincoln"" is a film whose power cannot be underestimated.  I thought so when I saw it in the theatre being so enthralled with Day-Lewis' portrayal of our greatest president.  Watching it a second time there were details though not overlooked the first time but overwhelmed by the central performance.  What impressed me was the poetry of the script by Tony Kushner adapted from the book by Doris Kearns Goodwin, ""Team of Rivals"".  Kushner juggles probably a few dozen characters with speaking parts and makes them full fledged players in the Universe of Lincoln. My favorite are the two lobbyists who try to influence wavering Democratic congressmen to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  The language of the film is almost Shakespearean in nature that you find yourself basking in its poetry.  Director Steven Spielberg serving as the master of ceremonies provides the aural and visual landscape for this play to unfold.  The focus, of course, is on Lincoln the man.  There's a tendency to deify him and the first time I saw this film I was taken up with Day-Lewis' charismatic turn.  Things I picked up this time in Day-Lewis' carefully calibrated performance is Lincoln's imperfections notably his wily lawyer trickiness and perhaps his shortcomings as a husband to Mary Todd (Sally Field) particularly in the wake of the death of their son, Willie.  That said these flaws not only accentuate Lincoln's fallibility but highlight his basic decency and empathy for his fellow man.  I could go on and on so rich an experience ""Lincoln"" is.  This is not merely a film but an event.

There were several moments I came to tears, yet it was scenes prior to the Ford's Theater shooting Spielberg spared us from showing, that moved me the most.  It was the telegraph office scene, when Lincoln was talking to two young telegraph operators & his riding through the war dead & visiting with Ulysees S. Grant that were monumental in making this the Best Picture of 2012. Lincoln's courage really set the world in motion of abolishing slavery on a world stage.

But there seems to be a disconcerting tendency in DreamWorks Blu-ray/DVD combo releases in forcing the consumer to shell out an inordinate amount of money just to get a few extra features which are produced on a separate disc even though there seems to be no particular reason (other than corporate greed) for doing so.The extras on the 4-disc combo of LINCOLN, while worthwhile and informative, could quite easily have been included on the disc containing the film--as, for example, they were on Universal's great new LES MISERABLES blu-ray (even though the running time of LES MIS is 8 minutes longer (!) than LINCOLN. One of the big selling points of blu-rays was that you supposedly have more content room on the disc than on a standard DVD, which makes the whole notion of having a separate ""extra features"" disc all the more mystifying.The reason I'm singling out DreamWorks in particular is that this is almost EXACTLY what they did for the 4-disc combo release of Spielberg's WAR HORSE. I say ""almost"" because at least in that instance, they packaged all of the  discs separately and correctly in an extra-large sized case.  For LINCOLN, the movie and special features discs were both simply jammed in together on one spindle (and in point of fact, the movie Blu-ray was scratched and skipped when I played it the first time).I realize that with the advent of the Blu-ray format, we were forced to bite our collective tongues and go along with buying into it if we wanted extra features on our discs since the DVD version nowadays is increasingly the ""bare-bones"" release, but enough is enough.In closing, I just want to reiterate that if the studios want we consumers to continue to support the Blu-ray format, they need to step up to the plate a little bit and not treat us like idiots who will sit still for anything.

1592786,A8N5EM32PVLZJ,B009AMANBA,Dean A. Anderson,"[10, 14]","Most of us have a pretty solid grip on history. Slavery was evil. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution which ended slavery was most excellent, and you would most certainly have voted for it. And Lincoln was a great guy as can be seen by the fact that he is on mineral and paper money.One of the marvelous things Steven Spielberg's film, Lincoln, does is show how difficult some of these choices were a century and a half ago. In April of 1864, the US Senate passed the 13th Amendment with relative ease. The passage of the amendment through the House of Representatives, which was much more of a struggle, is the focus of the film's action.I choose the word ""action"" carefully. If your knowledge of legislation comes from Schoolhouse Rock's ""I'm Just a Bill,"" you might be surprised by the intrigue, drama and humor that screenwriter Tony Kushner draws from public debate and backroom deals. We're not presented with clear white and black (or blue and grey) hats to root for or against. We see good, wise and, yes, Christian men pitted in opposition.Many Republican Representatives looked to Francis Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) for direction. Blair was concerned that passage of the amendment would endanger peace talks. As great an evil slavery was, he believed, war was a greater evil. Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), a leader of the abolitionist movement, had to downplay the scope and consequences of the legislation to help it pass. This galled the abolitionists, and was even more offensive to those of African descent.Other Christian men, primarily Democrats, believed that slavery itself wasn't evil, but was sanctioned by Scripture. Godly men (and women, but they couldn't vote) claimed to seek God's will on the issue of slavery and came to opposing positions. They didn't have history's hindsight to know what position would have the 21st century stamp of approval.Abraham Lincoln admitted as much, even in the midst of the great Civil War. In an 1862 memorandum, he wrote, ""In great contests, each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time."" Throughout the film we see Lincoln (portrayed brilliantly by Daniel Day-Lewis) fighting, sometime even underhandedly, for what he believes is right, all the while acknowledging that he might not be right. He acts boldly, yet with great humility.If Lincoln could show so much humility in the issues of slavery, war and suffrage, perhaps we can show some humility when it comes to such issues as abortion, marriage, and immigration. There are great dangers we face as Christians, and especially as a church, when we delve into issues the world views as political.Jesus confronted one such danger when approached on tax policy (Matthew 22: 17 - 21). Jesus said some realms belonged to God and some to Caesar. We need to discern which things are sacred and which are secular, but we must avoid two other great dangers: we must not ascribe ignorance, evil or incompetence to others, just because they disagree with our moral or political points of view, and we must not abandon great issues to the world just because they are controversial.The church played a great role in ending legal slavery in the Western World (don't think slavery itself is dead). The church helped secure civil rights and fought racial prejudice. There are many other moral battles that must be waged, but we must walk in the Lord's footsteps, being as wise as serpents, yet as gentle as doves.(Lincoln is rated PG-13 for graphic battlefield violence and vulgar language, some of it escaping the lips of the 16th President.)",5,"One Christian's View of ""Lincoln"" and Its Lessons for the Church Today",1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,3667,"['Most', 'have', 'pretty', 'solid', 'grip', 'history', 'Slavery', 'was', 'evil', '13th', 'Amendment', 'Constitution', 'ended', 'slavery', 'was', 'most', 'excellent', 'would', 'most', 'certainly', 'have', 'voted', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'great', 'guy', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'fact', 'mineral', 'paper', 'money.One', 'marvelous', 'things', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'show', 'how', 'difficult', 'choices', 'were', 'century', 'half', 'ago', 'April', '1864', 'US', 'Senate', 'passed', '13th', 'Amendment', 'relative', 'ease', 'passage', 'amendment', 'House', 'Representatives', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'struggle', 'focus', 'film', 'action.I', 'choose', 'word', 'action', 'carefully', 'knowledge', 'legislation', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', ""'m"", 'Just', 'Bill', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'intrigue', 'drama', 'humor', 'screenwriter', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'public', 'debate', 'backroom', 'deals', ""'re"", 'not', 'presented', 'clear', 'white', 'black', 'blue', 'grey', 'root', 'see', 'good', 'wise', 'yes', 'Christian', 'men', 'pitted', 'opposition.Many', 'Republican', 'Representatives', 'looked', 'Francis', 'Preston', 'Blair', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'direction', 'Blair', 'was', 'concerned', 'passage', 'amendment', 'would', 'endanger', 'peace', 'talks', 'great', 'evil', 'slavery', 'was', 'believed', 'war', 'was', 'greater', 'evil', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'leader', 'abolitionist', 'movement', 'had', 'downplay', 'scope', 'consequences', 'legislation', 'help', 'pass', 'galled', 'abolitionists', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'offensive', 'African', 'descent.Other', 'Christian', 'men', 'primarily', 'Democrats', 'believed', 'slavery', 'was', ""n't"", 'evil', 'was', 'sanctioned', 'Scripture', 'Godly', 'men', 'women', 'could', ""n't"", 'vote', 'claimed', 'seek', 'God', 'will', 'issue', 'slavery', 'came', 'opposing', 'positions', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'history', 'hindsight', 'know', 'what', 'position', 'would', 'have', '21st', 'century', 'stamp', 'approval.Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'admitted', 'much', 'even', 'midst', 'great', 'Civil', 'War', '1862', 'memorandum', 'wrote', 'great', 'contests', 'party', 'claims', 'act', 'accordance', 'will', 'God', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'wrong', 'God', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'thing', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'see', 'Lincoln', 'portrayed', 'brilliantly', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'fighting', 'sometime', 'even', 'underhandedly', 'what', 'right', 'while', 'acknowledging', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'boldly', 'yet', 'great', 'humility.If', 'Lincoln', 'could', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'humility', 'issues', 'slavery', 'war', 'suffrage', 'perhaps', 'can', 'show', 'humility', 'when', 'such', 'issues', 'abortion', 'marriage', 'immigration', 'are', 'great', 'dangers', 'face', 'Christians', 'especially', 'church', 'when', 'delve', 'issues', 'world', 'political.Jesus', 'confronted', 'one', 'such', 'danger', 'when', 'approached', 'tax', 'policy', 'Matthew', '22', '17', '21', 'Jesus', 'said', 'realms', 'belonged', 'God', 'Caesar', 'need', 'discern', 'things', 'are', 'sacred', 'are', 'secular', 'must', 'avoid', 'two', 'other', 'great', 'dangers', 'must', 'not', 'ascribe', 'ignorance', 'incompetence', 'others', 'just', 'disagree', 'moral', 'political', 'points', 'view', 'must', 'not', 'abandon', 'great', 'issues', 'world', 'just', 'are', 'controversial.The', 'church', 'played', 'great', 'role', 'ending', 'legal', 'slavery', 'Western', 'World', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'slavery', 'dead', 'church', 'helped', 'secure', 'civil', 'rights', 'fought', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'moral', 'battles', 'must', 'be', 'waged', 'must', 'walk', 'Lord', 'footsteps', 'being', 'as', 'wise', 'serpents', 'yet', 'as', 'gentle', 'doves', 'Lincoln', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'graphic', 'battlefield', 'violence', 'vulgar', 'language', 'escaping', 'lips', '16th', 'President']",N/A

From the very first sequence of dialogue it screamed ""Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.""  The film hasn't run 30 seconds, and you can tell right away that Spielberg has no natural feel for the material.  The following 135 minutes merely confirm that first impression ad nauseum.  There is nothing subtle or clever or insightful in either the scriptwriting or the direction. The cinematography is good, and there is nothing wrong with DDL's performance. Other than that, though, given the material they were starting from, the screenplay is uncomfortably close to awful.  Ham-fisted, really. Like something out of the 1930's or 1940's - Stilted, and awkward as ""Ruggles of Red Gap"", or ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"".135 minutes of bathos. Cannot imagine anyone sitting through it twice.What it brought to mind was the contrast between ""Schindler's List"", which won a bucket of Oscars, and ""Remains of the Day"", which had the misfortune of being in the same year, and therefore won nothing.  Nobody watches ""Schindler's List"" anymore, but ""Remains of the Day"" is rented over and over and is rightly regarded as an enduring classic for the twin outstanding performances of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.""Lincoln"" would have been a far, far better film if the screenplay had been written by somebody like Aaron Sorkin.  He would have understood the material and would have brought it to light, in a way that Spielberg apparently could not, and did not.  Spielberg doesn't get subtlety or irony - the qualities more than any others in which President Lincoln's transcendent genius was most often seen.  As for a director? Somebody like Clint Eastwood 15 years ago - at the time of ""Unforgiven"" - would have had a much better feel for it.

Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","As a young child, Steven Spielberg was captivated when he saw the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.Decades later, the filmmaker would direct and produce the historical drama film ""Lincoln"" that is based on Doris Kearn Goodwin's biography ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" focusing on the final four months of Abram Lincoln's life and focusing on his efforts to have the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution passed by the United States House of Representatives. in January 1865.Filmed in the Fall of 2011 and released theatrically int the Fall of 2012, ""Lincoln"" has received critical acclaim worldwide, earning seven Golden Globe nominations, twelve Academy Award nominations and grossing over $263 million at the box office, making ""Lincoln"" a financial success.The film would feature an all-star cast including Daniel Day-Lewis (""There Will Be Blood"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""The Last of the Mohicans""), Sally Field (""Forrest Gump"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""Brothers & Sisters""), David Strathairn (""The Bourne Ultimatum"", ""L.A. Confidential"", ""Good Night"" and ""Good Luck""), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Inception"", ""Looper"", ""(500) Days of Summer""), James Spader (""Boston Legal"", ""Stargate"", ""Secretary""), Hal Holbrook (""Wall Street"", Men of Honor"", ""Into the Wild""), Tommy Lee Jones (""No Country for Old Men"", ""Men in Black"" films, ""The Fugitive""), John Hawkes (""American Gangster, ""Identity"", ""The Sessions"") and many more.And now ""Lincoln"" was released on Blu-ray and DVD, including a 4-Disc Combo Pack which includes the Blu-ray (2), DVD and Digital Copy in March 2013.VIDEO:""Lincoln"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  With one of the most well-known cinematographers such as Janusz Kaminski (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Minority Report"", ""Catch Me If You Can"") working on the film, one can expect nothing but the best in terms of cinematography, capturing the characters in fantastic lighting situations.  And once again, Kaminski's cinematography is fantastic!  Featuring incredible detail and like era, using natural color to enhance the overall feeling of the film, skin tones are natural, the film features great contrast with outdoor scenes featuring a variety of colors, from a normal day to a cool, cold night where Abraham Lincoln and soldiers ride their horses through dead bodies during the war.  Black levels are nice and deep, Joanna Johnston's costume design and Rick Carter's production design of capturing authenticity is also captured amazingly on camera courtesy of Kaminski.""Lincoln"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for the audio, ""Lincoln"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HDMA, Envlish DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  I was very impressed with the lossless soundtrack.  It's one thing to expect crystal clear dialogue with wonderful music from legendary composer John Williams (""Star Wars"" films, ""Harry Potter"" films, ""Indiana Jones"" films) but the amount of ambiance captured through the surrounds is wonderful.  With the constant chattering during the political debates, there is also use of LFE during certain scenes.  But even sounds of storms, sounds of wood upon wood, may it be a closure of a room, wheel making contact on the floor, good use of rear surround channels.  But it's the dialogue and the ambiance along with Williams' music that sounds incredible.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Lincoln"" comes with the following special features:The Journey to Lincoln - (9:24) Featuring interviews with Steven Spielberg, producer Kathleen Kennedy and the cast about being part of the film and the creation of it.A Historic Tapestry: Richmond, Virginia - (4:00) Filmmaker Steven Spielberg and crew talk about being able to film at historic structures to recreate the feel of Washington, D.C. and Virginia during the Civil War era in Richmond, Virginia.In the Company of Character - (10:23) A featurette about the casting of the talent to play various characters and working with Daniel Day-Lewis.  Each cast member talks about their involvement in the film and meeting the other talents and how they immersed themselves and prepared for this film.Crafting the Past - (10:43) A special feature about costume and production design.  Production designer Rick Carter talks and costume designer Joanna Johnston about capturing the detail of the era and trying to make everything in the film look authentic.Living with Lincoln - (27:04) A special feature about a period biopic and the contribution to make this film feel like it was taking place in the past.  Capturing the look and feel but also through the performances.In Lincoln's Footsteps - (16:35) A featurette about the editing of the film and how it was important to have the long periods instead of constant cuts.  Discussing the visual perspective of the film and the audio.EXTRAS:""Lincoln"" comes with two Blu-rays (one for the feature film and the other for special features), a DVD and Digital Copy version of the film.  Also, a slipcover case is included.JUDGMENT CALL:When I was younger, my grandfather, an immigrant from the Philippines would always use Abraham Lincoln as an example for us and why people are fortunate today to be able to have a good education, strive for a good education because of what Lincoln was give people of color a chance of freedom in the United States.He would always talk about the Emancipation Proclamation and I as I grew older, like every child taught in school about what Lincoln did to free the slaves, it was an important order from Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War.Only until I became an adult, would you realize that there was much more to the story than the simple ""Lincoln freed the slaves!"" that we have been taught.  Along with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, it wasn't until the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 which abolished slavery, that the amendment was monumental.But it wasn't easy.  With so much focus of Lincoln on his assassination by John Wilkes Booth, I really didn't know too much about Abraham Lincoln's life until I saw the biographical silent film ""Abraham Lincoln"" (1930) directed by D.W. Griffith.  While this film focused on Lincoln's earlier life as a storekeeper and rail-splitter and his earlier romance with Ann Rutledge and later being engaged to Mary Todd and the Lincoln-Douglas debates about the extension of slavery, there really hasn't been anything showcasing the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment.I can understand why.  It's not an easy subject for one to craft and make it entertaining for general audiences,  People know how the amendment was historic, but would one want to watch it as a film?That's where filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes in and the fact that he is directing the film, the answer is yes.  If Spielberg can make this film entertaining, it's definitely worth giving a try.Joining him are top people in the industry, from composer John Williams, director of photography Janusz Kaminski, production designer Rick Carter and costume design by Joanna Johnston, and many others involved with the film, you know you have a great team.And what Spielberg is quite effective was building a storyline with showcasing how difficult of a time it was for President Lincoln.  While the Emancipation Proclamation helped give slaves a chance for freedom during the Civil War, if the war was to end, they would not be free any longer, and not too many were in favor of abolishing slavery, except President Lincoln and a few members of the US House of Representatives.  With wonderful production and costume design to keep the authenticity of the film and the amazing performances by actor Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathaim, Tommy Lee Jones, Joseph Gordon Levitt to name a few, you can't help but be amazed with how wonderful this film looks, but also how powerful the film is thanks to its outstanding talent.Daniel Day-Lewis captures the look of Abraham Lincoln, Sally Field who gained weight for the role was also able to play the unstable Mary Todd and of course other performers throughout the film, made the film feel authentic and real.The film is smart, compelling but also a message about freedom and equality. Also, it's a subject that not many people are familiar with and you learn that freedom did not come easy but also how President Lincoln took a risk that could have had him impeached.  But he was dedicated, persistent and also made others around him persistent, but most importantly have them put their faith in him to make it happen.  A lot was at stake for some people who voted for the amendment, some who were threatened but yet knowing what was right and debating within, whether or not to be loyal to their political party or to side with Abraham Lincoln in giving freedom to the slaves.As for the 4-Disc Combo Pack of ""Lincoln"", you get the Blu-ray release (two featuring the feature film, the other with special features), a DVD version of the film and a Digital Copy.  Picture quality along with lossless audio is magnificent, special features are good but I wished they were slightly longer.  It would have been nice to have an audio commentary or even other special features on Abraham Lincoln. But that is me being picky!  For the most part, ""Lincoln"" is a wonderful Blu-ray release and a film that is powerful and another cinematic masterpiece for Steven Spielberg.Overall, ""Lincoln"" is a fascinating, compelling film featuring fantastic cinematography, production and costume design but also  a magnificent performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field and many others.  Highly recommended!",5,"(4.5 Stars) Lincoln"" is a fascinating, compelling film!

1592798,ATA980NJ3OSZT,B009AMANBA,Dennis at Holy Apostles,"[1, 2]","What a gift to be honored with a glimpse into the life of Abraham Lincoln, one of America's most revered leaders, and rightly so. Some may argue that this movie is hagiography and a white wash, but IMHO, no way! The burden of proof falls on the naysayers. Don't get me wrong, ""Lincoln"" is not perfect. There is the goof up on the 13th Amendment vote (for the abolition of slavery in the U.S. and territories) in the U.S. House of Representatives by the Connecticut delegation. The movie says two ""no"" votes and the historical record says none. All of CT's representatives voted ""yes,"" as clarified by CT's 2nd District congressman Joe Courtney.Yes, I believe this movie got it right by portraying Lincoln as extremely likeable, even loveable. True, his enemies hated and reviled him, but perhaps mainly because his humble openness reflected their mean-spirited selfishness and bigotry back on them. Lincoln was a man of his times, as betrayed by some of his expressed ideas regarding African Americans, but he could also transcend those times. I've often wondered if someone as backwoodsy as Lincoln could ever get elected today. Now I am convinced that yes, he could -- and would. ""Honest Abe"" would stand out even more today than he did 150 years ago, and his homespun storytelling and humor would strike a chord in any generation. Add to that Lincoln's empathy and warmth, and you have someone who truly ""belongs to the ages.""Day-Lewis' Lincoln seemed very realistic. Here we see a man who would swear and pound his fist when angry, but who also showed that greatness of soul forged in the crucible of war. Before seeing ""Lincoln,"" I wondered if Sally Field was too old to play Lincoln's wife Mary. After seeing it, I realized that both Lincoln and his wife had become prematurely old by 1865. As General Grant observed in the film, Lincoln aged ten years between 1864 and 1865. The last photographs of Lincoln bear this out. Tragedy ages a person who really cares for others.Regarding the importance of the slavery issue, again I feel this movie got it right. Slavery wasn't everything, but it was the main thing. The states' rights dispute was based on economics, and the Confederate economy thrived on cheap and always accessible labor. Doing away with slavery would force an unwanted paradigm shift down the South's throat. Today, slavery is unthinkable, but then it was not. The movie ""Lincoln"" helps us to understand that a little better. All in all, a great movie with several minor flaws, none of which threaten a five star rating. In addition to Sally Field's fine effort and Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens, David Strathairn was brilliant as Secretary of State William H.

Yet the awards, the acclaim, the accolades, the audience reception of this remarkable film speak for themselves.  Telling the story of the last four months of our 16th President's life, LINCOLN focuses on the passage of the 13th Amendment--the abolishment of slavery.  The Civil War is winding down; Lincoln, fearful that his Emancipation Proclamation which declared the slaves war contraband would be struck down by the courts, takes on a sense of urgency to pass the amendment in the month of January, during a lame duck Congress.  With a slim Republican majority, the president is going to need some Democrats to join the Republicans; fortunately, there are 64 lame duck Democrats--who just might be looking for patronage jobs come March.  Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn), the president's right hand man, recruits three self-proclaimed ""scoundrels"" (James Spader, John Hawkes, Tim Blake Nelson) to approach these Democrats in an effort to ""buy"" them off.  The machinations of this sausage making is fascinating, and as a Confederate delegation reaches General Grant (Jared Harris) to discuss a cessation of hostilities, the story becomes more layered and compelling.  We all know from history the amendment passes--narrowly--and LINCOLN then focuses on the ending of the brutal war--and the tragic ending of the president's life.Daniel Day-Lewis is an extraordinary actor, and here he gives a spellbinding performance as the tall, slender, introverted, brooding, careworn Commander-in-Chief.  Yet the actor conveys another layer to this complex man; Lincoln might have the weight of the world on his shoulders, but his wit was always razor sharp, and he could relate a plethora of stories at the drop of a hat.  Day-Lewis makes this film work, and work exceedingly well.  The entire cast is stellar, but in particular I was most impressed by Tommy Lee Jones (fierce abolitionist Congressman Thaddeus Stevens), Sally Field (a shrill, feisty Mary Todd Lincoln), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (eldest child Robert Lincoln, who desperately wants to get in the fight), James Spader as referenced above, Bruce McGill (fiery Secretary of War Edwin Stanton), and Jared Harris as General Grant in what was comparably a very small role.  Numerous actors have relatively brief roles as Congressmen or telegraph operators or staffers, yet everyone meshes in elegant believability.This Blu-Ray edition offers several bonus features; all of them are very good.  From interviews with Spielberg, the cast, and the production crew, to showing us how the film was shot in Richmond, Virginia, to behind-the-scenes looks at sets, costumes, props, and musical scoring, it's all material that enhances the viewing experience.  Spielberg has made several remarkable films.  There would be no objection from this reviewer to make the argument that LINCOLN is this filmmaker's very best.--D.

Everyone in this film is either a pontificator or a wide-eyed admirer of pontification. Not even Tony Kushner, not even Daniel Day Lewis can make Abe or his stories (or backroom politicking) seem remotely interesting. Everything about the film is as leaden as a civil war toy soldier. Its clear that Spielberg has no idea what to do with real historical figures (other than revere them), but the real problem here is that the story is not an uplifting one, in fact its downright depressing, and so Spielberg's signature sentimentalism is all wrong for this material: what this film effectively shows is that the only way to ratfiy the 13th amendment was with bribes, threats, and trickery, so what is supposed to be a film documenting one of our prouder moments as a nation is actually a film that undermines that history/that notion of ourselves as morally exceptional. That is not Spielberg's fault, he's just relating the story here. What is Spielberg's fault is that he doesn't seem to know what kind of story he is telling nor does he seem to be aware that he is leaving a very important part of that story untold: the part African-Americans played in their own emancipation/liberation. We do not see or hear from any educated African-Americans like Fredrick Douglas. Instead we only see (mostly mute) black soldiers and house slaves and the way Spielberg represents the house slaves/servants would make it seem as though the film was made in another century and for audiences not used to seeing African-American subjects with speaking parts. Its vision of African-Americans is in many ways more problematic than the vision of African-Americans offered up by Tarantino, because at least the director of Django Unchained has never purported to be in the realism game. Still, Lincoln fails for the exact same reason that Django Unchained fails--its a movie more about the director's relation to movie history (and his preferred modes of storytelling/representation) than it is about history, and therefore its a movie incapable of commenting on anything or being about anything or generating intertest in anything outside its directors closed and limited cinematic universe. A great director, a great film, tells us something about the world, but with each Spielberg film and with each Tarantino film we can see that the directors are much more interested in movies (Spielberg is fascinated by 1940's films/aesthetics; Tarantino in 1970's films/aesthetics) than they are in real life, and so the films just come out as branded (and self-referential) products from Spielberg Inc or Tarantino Inc instead of as art objects capable of inspiring feeling and generating thought about the world itself. Both directors have obvious talents, but the limits of those talents are more on display in their latest works than are the merits of those talents. Spielberg is capable of making inspiring work, but here Spielberg is trying to be inspiring with a story that is more complex than his sentimentalizing aesthetic wants to allow.",2,Spielberg at his least inspiring,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,3139,"['Lincoln', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'fun', '8th', 'grade', 'civics', 'geometry', 'class', 'count', 'Euclid', 'lecture', 'Everyone', 'film', 'pontificator', 'wide-eyed', 'admirer', 'pontification', 'Not', 'even', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'not', 'even', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'can', 'make', 'Abe', 'stories', 'backroom', 'politicking', 'seem', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'Everything', 'film', 'as', 'leaden', 'civil', 'war', 'toy', 'soldier', 'clear', 'Spielberg', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'real', 'historical', 'figures', 'other', 'revere', 'real', 'problem', 'here', 'story', 'not', 'uplifting', 'one', 'fact', 'downright', 'depressing', 'so', 'Spielberg', 'signature', 'sentimentalism', 'wrong', 'material', 'what', 'film', 'effectively', 'only', 'way', 'ratfiy', '13th', 'amendment', 'was', 'bribes', 'threats', 'trickery', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'film', 'documenting', 'one', 'prouder', 'moments', 'nation', 'actually', 'film', 'notion', 'ourselves', 'morally', 'exceptional', 'not', 'Spielberg', 'fault', 'just', 'relating', 'story', 'here', 'What', 'Spielberg', 'fault', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'story', 'telling', 'seem', 'be', 'aware', 'leaving', 'very', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'untold', 'part', 'African-Americans', 'played', 'own', 'emancipation/liberation', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'hear', 'educated', 'African-Americans', 'Fredrick', 'Douglas', 'Instead', 'only', 'see', 'mostly', 'black', 'soldiers', 'house', 'slaves', 'way', 'Spielberg', 'house', 'slaves/servants', 'would', 'make', 'seem', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'century', 'audiences', 'not', 'used', 'seeing', 'African-American', 'subjects', 'speaking', 'parts', 'vision', 'African-Americans', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'problematic', 'vision', 'African-Americans', 'offered', 'up', 'Tarantino', 'least', 'director', 'Django', 'Unchained', 'never', 'purported', 'be', 'realism', 'game', 'Still', 'Lincoln', 'exact', 'same', 'reason', 'Django', 'Unchained', 'fails', 'movie', 'more', 'director', 'relation', 'movie', 'history', 'preferred', 'modes', 'storytelling/representation', 'history', 'therefore', 'movie', 'incapable', 'commenting', 'anything', 'being', 'anything', 'generating', 'intertest', 'anything', 'directors', 'closed', 'limited', 'cinematic', 'universe', 'great', 'director', 'great', 'film', 'something', 'world', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'Tarantino', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'directors', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'movies', 'Spielberg', 'fascinated', '1940', 'films/aesthetics', 'Tarantino', '1970', 'films/aesthetics', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'so', 'films', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'branded', 'self-referential', 'products', 'Spielberg', 'Inc', 'Tarantino', 'Inc', 'instead', 'art', 'capable', 'inspiring', 'feeling', 'generating', 'thought', 'world', 'directors', 'have', 'obvious', 'talents', 'limits', 'talents', 'are', 'more', 'display', 'latest', 'works', 'are', 'merits', 'talents', 'Spielberg', 'capable', 'making', 'inspiring', 'work', 'here', 'Spielberg', 'trying', 'be', 'inspiring', 'story', 'more', 'complex', 'sentimentalizing', 'aesthetic', 'allow']",N/A

1592832,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B009AMANBA,Doug Park,"[9, 13]","{4.5 stars}First off, ""Lincoln"" is more about the passage of the 13th Amendment outlawing slavery in the U.S. and all the haggling that took place in the House of Representatives beforehand than it is about Abe Lincoln personally. The entire story takes place in the early months of 1865 as the Civil War is winding down.Lincoln does, of course, play a pivotal role as the central character in his proposal and backing of the Amendment (yet still, kind of not wanting the war to end before it was voted upon in order to keep the Southern delegations out of the vote). There is also a fine subplot concerning Lincoln's life with his wife and sons, all of whom are admirably played. Day-Lewis really shines in  his role as a Lincoln who is neither saint nor sinner, with a smooth, velvety, and vaguely southern(!) accent. Many of the supporting cast--most particularly, Jared Harris as Ulysses Grant--are also memorably portrayed.This may not sound terribly exciting to some, but the acting, storyline, scenery and everything else are so arresting that those people are likely to forget not being all that interested. Along with the vital ingredient of plot, some other best things about ""Lincoln"" are its setting and costume design: This film probably conveys the Civil War period better than any that I've seen. There isn't much actual showing of the war, but a couple of very brief but vivid and ultra-realistic battleground scenes really spice things up. Both in Washington and in the brief scenes elsewhere, the cinematography takes you there in a powerful way.Finally, this film is very revealing about the ""buying"" of votes in Congress and effectively shows how political processes worked and continue to work. A fascinating bit of historical and political intrigue.A couple of tips:--Younger audiences, unless they happen to have an unusual interest in political processes, are likely to be bored with ""Lincoln.""--If you aren't all that up on Secretary of State William Seward, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, and some of the various other players (maybe check the character list on imdb?), it might be helpful to read-up a little on them before watching this.",5,2.5 Hours that Will Fly By Very Quickly,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,2167,"['4.5', 'stars', 'First', 'off', 'Lincoln', 'more', 'passage', '13th', 'Amendment', 'outlawing', 'slavery', 'U.S.', 'haggling', 'took', 'place', 'House', 'Representatives', 'beforehand', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'personally', 'entire', 'story', 'place', 'early', 'months', '1865', 'Civil', 'War', 'winding', 'down.Lincoln', 'course', 'play', 'pivotal', 'role', 'central', 'character', 'proposal', 'backing', 'Amendment', 'yet', 'still', 'kind', 'not', 'wanting', 'war', 'end', 'was', 'voted', 'order', 'keep', 'Southern', 'delegations', 'vote', 'also', 'fine', 'subplot', 'concerning', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'wife', 'sons', 'whom', 'are', 'admirably', 'played', 'Day-Lewis', 'really', 'role', 'Lincoln', 'who', 'saint', 'sinner', 'smooth', 'velvety', 'vaguely', 'southern', 'accent', 'Many', 'supporting', 'cast', 'most', 'particularly', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'Ulysses', 'Grant', 'are', 'also', 'memorably', 'portrayed.This', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'terribly', 'exciting', 'acting', 'storyline', 'scenery', 'everything', 'else', 'are', 'so', 'arresting', 'people', 'are', 'likely', 'forget', 'not', 'being', 'interested', 'vital', 'ingredient', 'plot', 'other', 'best', 'things', 'Lincoln', 'are', 'setting', 'costume', 'design', 'film', 'probably', 'Civil', 'War', 'period', 'better', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""n't"", 'much', 'actual', 'showing', 'war', 'couple', 'very', 'brief', 'vivid', 'ultra-realistic', 'battleground', 'scenes', 'really', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'Washington', 'brief', 'scenes', 'elsewhere', 'cinematography', 'there', 'powerful', 'way.Finally', 'film', 'very', 'revealing', 'buying', 'votes', 'Congress', 'effectively', 'how', 'political', 'processes', 'worked', 'continue', 'work', 'fascinating', 'bit', 'historical', 'political', 'intrigue.A', 'couple', 'tips', 'Younger', 'audiences', 'happen', 'have', 'unusual', 'interest', 'political', 'processes', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'bored', 'Lincoln', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'up', 'Secretary', 'State', 'William', 'Seward', 'Representative', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'various', 'other', 'players', 'maybe', 'check', 'character', 'list', 'imdb', 'might', 'be', 'helpful', 'read-up', 'little', 'watching']",N/A

Tommy Lee Jones provides admirable support as Stevens, the pro-Abolitionist who is nonetheless reluctant to support Lincoln in his efforts.  Beautifully photographed, with atmospheric music by John Williams, this film is long (140 minutes)m, but well worth the effort.

1592835,A2GYCEAZYQ0ZUY,B009AMANBA,Dr. Robert F. Knoll,"[1, 2]","A young boy lies half asleep in front of a fireplace which provides the only light in an otherwise darkened room. The door opens and his long and lanky father enters, lying down beside him and offering him a piggyback ride to bed. Both father and son are united in affection and grief for the boy who isn't there but whose absence haunts a troubled family. Such grace notes, which lead us deeply into the emotional lives of the Lincoln family, are characteristic of Tony Kushner's masterful screenplay which condenses the political and personal Lincoln in a way that illuminates his last few months as well as entertains its audience with the down and dirty machinations necessary to steer the 13th Amendment to the Constitution through a deeply divided House of Representatives.Abraham Lincoln, perhaps the most loved and influential of American presidents, emerges in all his imperfect and very human glory as political philosopher and tactician, humanitarian, storyteller, husband and father through the brilliantly calibrated performance of Daniel Day Lewis, recipient of a landmark third Academy Award for Best Actor. We come to see, under the sure and certain guidance of director Steven Spielberg, Abraham Lincoln as the necessary catalyst for Barack Obama: no Lincoln, no 13th Amendment, no enfranchisement for African Americans, no Obama presidency.Listening to the hyperbolic and inflamed rhetoric which Congressmen, especially the radical abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens of Tommy Lee Jones, hurl at each other on the floor of the House, as well as Lincoln's amused comment to Secretary of State Seward (David Strathairn) about the progress of Confederate delegates on their way to discuss peace issues, ""Do you think that word won't get out...in Washington?"", we can appreciate how the past is prologue to the present political paralysis in the capitol.Among the huge and carefully chosen cast, Sally Field gives the performance of her career, blending subtlety, variety, articulation, restraint or passion as the situation requires, into a cohesive whole. Field creates a Mary Lincoln that shatters the received wisdom. Here is a sympathetic, no punches pulled woman who recognizes how much her husband is loved yet blames him for the death of their middle son. She interprets his dreams, agitates on behalf of the 13th Amendment, dresses down her husband's opponents in public and tries to keep her eldest son out of war service. Robert Lincoln, as interpreted by Joseph Gordon Levitt, is the voice of youthful enthusiasm for a fight and the embodiment of integrity, parallel to the young police officer, Robin, Gordon Levitt played in ""The Dark Knight Rises.""Looking, through the eyes of his black valet, at Daniel Day Lewis's Abraham Lincoln in his trademark stove pipe hat and his ill fitting formal clothes as he walks down a White House hall, is to see the man under those clothes: the rural, story loving, self educated and self deprecating lawyer who fashioned some of the most idealistic, poetic and deeply felt words ever uttered on the national, and world, stage.The Lincoln of Daniel Day Lewis, Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner will have a very long shelf life, thanks to American history teachers who will keep it alive in high school and college classrooms for the next century or more.

1592837,A41XDR2AM962G,B009AMANBA,DVD reviewer,"[3, 4]","Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" is both a sprawling character study and a behind-the-scenes story of how the United States came to abolish slavery. Rated PG-13, the film contains really just three scenes that are too graphic for younger children:  the opening Civil War battle sequence, which is extremely violent; a scene mid-point where Robert Lincoln refuses to go inside a hospital with his father, but witnesses something far worse than wounded soldiers outside; and a scene near the end when Lincoln rides a horse through a battlefield filled with dead soldiers.If you shield young ones from those scenes, and maybe plug their ears for the punch line of a story involving a picture of George Washington hanging in a bathroom, they'd be able to watch ""Lincoln""--though I can't imagine any of them lasting very long. ""Lincoln"" will be too slow-moving and, at 150 minutes, too long for most children. The film is driven by dialogue, and the scenes of backdoor politicking that appeal to adults may seem confusing to children.

Constitution outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for a crime.  Steven Spielberg's film, ""Lincoln,"" from a screenplay by Tony Kushner and based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, ""Team of Rivals,"" describes the horse trading and finagling that was necessary to pass the amendment in the House of Representatives.  Daniel Day Lewis is fine as the title character; Lewis's plain demeanor, humor, compassion, pragmatism, and eloquent speech do justice to the iconic individual he portrays.  Another standout is Tommy Lee Jones as Republican leader Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania.  An ardent abolitionist, Stevens clashed violently with members of the pro-slavery faction during heated debates on the floor of the House.  The rest of the cast, including David Strathairn, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, acquit themselves well, although Sally Field's depiction of Mary Todd Lincoln could have been more subtle.""Lincoln,"" as political pundit David Brooks wrote recently, reveals the dirty, nasty, and practical side of politics.  In a democracy, there is never a universal consensus regarding controversial issues.  So how do we avoid gridlock?  Savvy presidents try to curry favor among their opponents, twist arms, and make deals.  Goodwin praises Lincoln for reaching out to his rivals and doing what was necessary to bring warring factions together.  He refused to stand on ceremony, since the window of opportunity to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed was rapidly closing.Although ""Lincoln"" is an enlightening reenactment of a pivotal moment in American history, the film is long (two and a half hours) and talky.  There are brief scenes in which union and rebel soldiers fight to the death, Lincoln visits and consoles the wounded, and the President takes a somber tour of a bloody battlefield.  Aside from these interludes, most of ""Lincoln"" consists of men arguing about the pros and cons of slavery, the amendment's chances of passage, and how to extract votes from the holdouts.  This does not make for engrossing and fast-paced cinema.Janusz Kaminski's photography is effective, but Tony Kushner's script is sluggishly paced and John William's score is florid and intrusive.  ""Lincoln"" fails the ""watch test.""  When I sit in a theater, if I glance at my watch more than three times, wondering how much longer the movie will run, that is not a good sign.  Nevertheless, seeing Daniel Day Lewis take command in such an inspiring role is worth the price of admission.  ""Lincoln"" provides a reality check for those who naively believe that running a national government, especially during wartime, is anything but messy and nerve-racking.  ""Lincoln"" earns three and a half stars, raised to four for Daniel Day Lewis's stunning performance.",4,"""Shall we stop this bleeding?""",1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,2828,"['Thirteenth', 'Amendment', 'U.', 'S.', 'Constitution', 'outlaws', 'slavery', 'involuntary', 'servitude', 'punishment', 'crime', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'screenplay', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'based', 'Doris', 'Kearns', 'Goodwin', 'book', 'Team', 'Rivals', 'horse', 'trading', 'finagling', 'was', 'necessary', 'pass', 'amendment', 'House', 'Representatives', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'fine', 'title', 'character', 'Lewis', 'plain', 'demeanor', 'humor', 'compassion', 'pragmatism', 'eloquent', 'speech', 'do', 'justice', 'iconic', 'individual', 'standout', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Republican', 'leader', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'Pennsylvania', 'ardent', 'abolitionist', 'Stevens', 'clashed', 'violently', 'members', 'pro-slavery', 'faction', 'heated', 'debates', 'floor', 'House', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'James', 'Spader', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'acquit', 'well', 'Sally', 'Field', 'depiction', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'subtle', 'Lincoln', 'political', 'pundit', 'David', 'Brooks', 'wrote', 'recently', 'dirty', 'nasty', 'practical', 'side', 'politics', 'democracy', 'never', 'universal', 'consensus', 'regarding', 'controversial', 'issues', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'avoid', 'gridlock', 'Savvy', 'presidents', 'try', 'curry', 'favor', 'opponents', 'twist', 'arms', 'make', 'deals', 'Goodwin', 'Lincoln', 'reaching', 'out', 'rivals', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'necessary', 'bring', 'warring', 'factions', 'together', 'refused', 'stand', 'ceremony', 'window', 'opportunity', 'get', 'Thirteenth', 'Amendment', 'passed', 'was', 'rapidly', 'closing.Although', 'Lincoln', 'enlightening', 'reenactment', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'American', 'history', 'film', 'long', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'are', 'brief', 'scenes', 'union', 'rebel', 'soldiers', 'fight', 'death', 'Lincoln', 'visits', 'wounded', 'President', 'somber', 'tour', 'bloody', 'battlefield', 'Aside', 'interludes', 'most', 'Lincoln', 'men', 'arguing', 'pros', 'cons', 'slavery', 'amendment', 'chances', 'passage', 'how', 'extract', 'votes', 'holdouts', 'not', 'make', 'engrossing', 'fast-paced', 'cinema.Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'photography', 'effective', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'script', 'sluggishly', 'paced', 'John', 'William', 'score', 'florid', 'intrusive', 'Lincoln', 'watch', 'test', 'When', 'sit', 'theater', 'glance', 'watch', 'more', 'three', 'times', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'movie', 'will', 'run', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'Nevertheless', 'seeing', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'take', 'command', 'such', 'inspiring', 'role', 'price', 'admission', 'Lincoln', 'reality', 'check', 'who', 'naively', 'believe', 'running', 'national', 'government', 'especially', 'wartime', 'anything', 'messy', 'nerve-racking', 'Lincoln', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'raised', 'four', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'stunning', 'performance']",N/A

1592845,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B009AMANBA,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 11]","To say that Daniel Day-Lewis inhabits the title role feels like such a total understatement. The iconic role has been the career-peaking touchstone for dozens of esteemed actors since the dawn of cinema including Henry Fonda, Raymond Massey (who earned an Oscar nomination in 1940 for his Lincoln), Gregory Peck, and even cast member Hal Holbrook (who plays Republican leader Francis Preston Blair here), but none have come across with the deceptively casual verisimilitude of Day-Lewis in Steven Spielberg's masterful 2012 historical drama. The versatile actor is able to bring multiple layers of human dimension to a public figure known to us only through books, marble statues, or perhaps a childhood trip to Disneyland where he remains an animatronic mannequin in ""Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln"". Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner (Angels in America) wisely do not attempt an episodic treatment of Lincoln's life but rather focus on January 1865, a critical month at the beginning of the President's second term when he was undergoing the most important event of his life.Based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin's superb treatise,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, the 150-minute film focuses on the conundrum he faced in pushing the 13th amendment, the abolition of slavery, through the House of Representatives toward legislation while facing immense pressure among all factions to end the now-four-year-old Civil War and reclaim the Confederacy into the Union. The movie's deliberately narrow focus allows us to see Lincoln as a relatable human being, someone with a determined sense of mission but also less than ideal with a surprising albeit understandable streak of opportunism that a broader biopic would have glossed over. It also means the story consists of subtle moments rather than milestone events that would signal the next historical battle. Although Spielberg bookends the film with unblinking scenes of carnage true to the period, the film relies primarily on the human drama that comes from the argument of opposing ideas and the minutiae of political strategy used to win favor among influential politicosIt's a story that has obvious relevance to the Washington political scene of today. The movie also examines the additional burden Lincoln was experiencing with his fractious home life. He struggles to keep the peace with his tempestuous wife Mary still grieving over the death of their third son Willie three years earlier, as well as their first-born Robert who becomes desperate to enlist in the Union Army against his parents' wishes. Kushner's superbly understated screenplay lets the plotlines intertwine organically and keeps Spielberg's tendency toward bravura filmmaking in check. Only toward the end when we recognize what is about to happen to Lincoln did I feel Spielberg's use of unspoken prescience a bit too heightened. The performances are stunning examples of what great filmmaking can generate with the right cast. Day-Lewis' Lincoln is for the ages. It amazes me that Liam Neeson was attached to the project for six years before generously abandoning it because Day-Lewis appears born to play the role. With a choked Midwestern tenor, he vividly evokes a man gifted at conflict resolution and oratory splendor but not above manipulating information to achieve the greater good.Two other performances are nearly as stellar. Tommy Lee Jones hones in on his particular brand of irascibility to bring fiery abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens to life, and Kushner gives him the lion's share of clever vitriol in the script. As Mary, Sally Field is a constant presence but has probably about three showy scenes where she is able to show her considerable talent to the full. Nearly a half-century sinceGidgetand more than a decade older than Day-Lewis, this diminutive actress gained 25 pounds and defies the odds by immersing herself completely into all the conflicting impulses that made Mary such a complicated, controversial historical figure. There are five Oscars among this accomplished trio, and more could very well be forthcoming. Many other actors in the expansive cast are worthy of mention, including James Spader's surprisingly amusing turn as a Republican lobbyist, Hal Holbrook's avuncular bluster as Blair, Gloria Reuben's quiet fortitude as Mary's confidant Elizabeth Keckley, and David Straitharn providing a jittery voice of reason as Secretary of State William Seward. A few actors like the omnipresent Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert are not given enough time to flesh out their characters.

1592846,AY1HVIM2V067E,B009AMANBA,"Edward G. Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[1, 1]","Many people, in reviewing this movie at various forums (but not here for some reason) claimed to be ""bored"" and not ""entertained"" by Spielberg's Lincoln.But the film's ""boring"" pace is precisely its greatness. It should be compared to Terence Malick's WWII film ""The Thin Red Line"" which came out at the same time as Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan""; many people, who considered themselves mainstream politically or conservative, disliked The Thin Red Line (and liked Ryan)) because like Lincoln, The Thin Red Line didn't pander to expectations; the exciting shots of landing craft racing towards the beach in the beginning of The Thin Red Line failed to be followed by a fight as expected. Interestingly, the audience in The Thin Red Line may be said to be ravening for the blood of images of men who could be their grandfathers while the men who could be their grandfathers are relieved that the Japanese have cleared the beach.Lincoln is ""about"" the last months of the war when it was at once necessary and Constitutional if containing some chicanery to get a 13th (antislavery) amendment passed before a Union victory. It was necessary to do so because if Lincoln had waited until peace, the reconstructed Southern congress could pass an anti-antislavery amendment which would be a serious violation of the ""states' rights"" of NORTHERN states who sought to ban all manifestations of slavery within their borders...including the site of slave ""coffles"": escaped slaves and even freedmen, who'd found sanctuary in a free state like Dred Scott, being sent, in chains, in a FREE state, back to their slave state. This itself shows that Southroners didn't give a damn about ""states' rights"" because they refused to acknowledge the right of Nothern states not to have to accommodate the slave coffles.Lincoln, having grown up in an Ohio valley where blacks lived in fear despite living in free states, was determined to effectively end slavery by passing a Constitutional amendment, revocable only by supermajorities, that would discourage a reconstructed Congress from trying to re-enable slavery through ordinary legislation, and the viewer of the movie, DVD or BluRay needs to understand this.

1592848,A3A8P8IBH7L1WW,B009AMANBA,Edward,"[4, 8]","Steven Spielberg seems to fluctuate between the serious (""Schindler's List"") and the silly, such as ""War of the Worlds"", but in his new feature ""Lincoln"" he has come down to earth to present a realistic depiction of the 16th President during his last four months. Lincoln, with his skeletal physique (it has been suggested he had Marfan's Syndrome) and his reedy voice, was not the most elegant President we ever had, but historians believe he was one of the most powerful. Tony Kushner's screenplay presents him unglamorously but at the same time reveals the unusually strong character and the brilliant mind behind the gentle demeanor and the rural, sometimes long-winded anecdotes (not completely appreciated by all his cabinet members, the scenario makes clear). The picture doesn't open too promisingly, an obligatory battle scene, followed by Union soldiers quoting the Gettysburg Address from memory -- to its author! And as the story progresses, and Lincoln is determined to make his Emancipation Proclamation an amendment to the Constitution (it eventually took effect in late 1865) there are long scenes of conversations and confrontations in gloomy rooms, not exactly the type of thing to keep an average action-flick fan spellbound. (Regarding that gloom: viewers living in the 21st Century may have difficulty understanding how dark interiors were prior to the installation of electricity.) But Spielberg keeps things tense, partly by wisely  choosing Daniel Day-Lewis, probably the best film actor of his generation, to play the title role and having an array of excellent character actors -- Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn, Jackie Earl Haley, et al -- to support him. The huge creative team of ""Lincoln""  has worked hard to make the political story approachable for general audiences (it's rated PG-13 not only for its mature conflicts but for the harrowing scene in which amputated arms and legs are dumped into a trench outside a military hospital) and also to guide the movie away from clich&eacute;s; for instance, the  assassination is not shown at Ford's Theater but is announced in front of the curtain at a theater where the President's son Tad is enjoying a pantomime. Altogether Kushner's script, along with Spielberg's direction and the cinematography by Janusz Kami&#324;ski (a great deal of it based on vintage photographs) bring Lincoln's world vividly to life. But feminists should be aware it's a very masculine world, scene after scene populated solely by men; and when it's suggested in session that women may someday have the right to vote, the whole chamber rears up, howling with horror.",4,For the people,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,2623,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'fluctuate', 'serious', 'Schindler', 'List', 'silly', 'such', 'War', 'Worlds', 'new', 'feature', 'Lincoln', 'come', 'down', 'earth', 'present', 'realistic', 'depiction', '16th', 'President', 'last', 'four', 'months', 'Lincoln', 'skeletal', 'physique', 'been', 'suggested', 'had', 'Marfan', 'Syndrome', 'reedy', 'voice', 'was', 'not', 'most', 'elegant', 'President', 'ever', 'had', 'historians', 'believe', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'screenplay', 'unglamorously', 'same', 'time', 'unusually', 'strong', 'character', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'gentle', 'demeanor', 'rural', 'sometimes', 'long-winded', 'anecdotes', 'not', 'completely', 'appreciated', 'cabinet', 'members', 'scenario', 'clear', 'picture', ""n't"", 'open', 'too', 'promisingly', 'obligatory', 'battle', 'scene', 'followed', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'quoting', 'Gettysburg', 'Address', 'memory', 'author', 'story', 'Lincoln', 'determined', 'make', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'amendment', 'Constitution', 'eventually', 'took', 'effect', 'late', '1865', 'are', 'long', 'scenes', 'conversations', 'confrontations', 'gloomy', 'rooms', 'not', 'exactly', 'type', 'thing', 'keep', 'average', 'action-flick', 'fan', 'spellbound', 'Regarding', 'gloom', 'viewers', 'living', '21st', 'Century', 'may', 'have', 'difficulty', 'understanding', 'how', 'dark', 'interiors', 'were', 'prior', 'installation', 'electricity', 'Spielberg', 'things', 'tense', 'partly', 'wisely', 'choosing', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'actor', 'generation', 'play', 'title', 'role', 'having', 'array', 'excellent', 'character', 'actors', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Jackie', 'Earl', 'Haley', 'et', 'al', 'support', 'huge', 'creative', 'team', 'Lincoln', 'worked', 'hard', 'make', 'political', 'story', 'approachable', 'general', 'audiences', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'not', 'only', 'mature', 'conflicts', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'amputated', 'arms', 'legs', 'are', 'dumped', 'trench', 'military', 'hospital', 'also', 'guide', 'movie', 'away', 'clich', 'eacute', 'instance', 'assassination', 'not', 'shown', 'Ford', 'Theater', 'announced', 'front', 'curtain', 'theater', 'where', 'President', 'son', 'Tad', 'enjoying', 'pantomime', 'Altogether', 'Kushner', 'script', 'Spielberg', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'Janusz', 'Kami', '324', 'ski', 'great', 'deal', 'based', 'vintage', 'photographs', 'bring', 'Lincoln', 'world', 'vividly', 'life', 'feminists', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'very', 'masculine', 'world', 'scene', 'scene', 'populated', 'solely', 'men', 'when', 'suggested', 'session', 'women', 'may', 'someday', 'have', 'right', 'vote', 'whole', 'chamber', 'up', 'howling', 'horror']",N/A

1592850,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B009AMANBA,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[2, 2]","""Lincoln"" seems to be a slow start but rapidly picks up momentum of a man trying to end the bloodshed of a Civil War and add a 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution before the South surrenders and is readmitted to the Union. Does President Lincoln negotiate their surrender now, saving countless lives, but also guaranteeing that a represented South will surely kill any chances of the passage of the amendment, an amendment that abolishes slavery? What President Abraham Lincoln doesn't know is that he is in a race against time because this film takes place in the last few months of his life.In order to get the amendment passed in the House of Representatives, the president must get the votes. We witness horse-trading, deceit and intrigues at its finest or ugliest, to get the two thirds majority required for the next step in the process.Daniel-Day Louis is in the title role and wins an Oscar for his performance. He offers us the same high voice that Abraham Lincoln was reported to have. He frequently reverts to his folksy charm during serious or heated discussions with a story or anecdote. He is an adoring father to both his sons, but especially the younger Tad who in real life had a cleft palate that was so bad his food had to be specially prepared so he could chew it.Steven Spielberg gave us many more superb performances from Sally Field as the bi-polar Mary Todd Lincoln, the 16th president's wife. Often seen but still under-rated David Strathairn plays his politically-savvy Secretary of State William Seward. Bruce McGill plays Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, and has one of the most memorable lines in the film: ""No, you, you're not going to tell another story,"" as he stalks off out of earshot of a Lincoln yarn. This ensemble cast continued with Tommy Lee Jones as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, a staunch abolitionist from Pennsylvania. Hal Holbrook plays a Republican politico who tries to end the war.What you get from Steven Spielberg's direction is attention to detail, right down to the White House wallpaper. You also get extra, perhaps too much extra. Critics say that the film's ending would have been better if we just saw Lincoln walking down the hall, on his way to Ford's Theater. If that had been it, we wouldn't have seen Todd Lincoln scream when a man announces to the audience that the president was shot. The final scene of revisiting Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address added little to the film.Still, you get the two most important events that make a great story, a taut, intelligent script delivered by unparalleled acting.P.S. This movie is history which always drives me to find more, and my focus was on Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones' character), representative from Pennsylvania.  He was living with his black housekeeper for a number of years. He adopted her sons, and offered her a choice of $5,000 in one lump sum, or $500 a year for ten years in his Will. When he died his body was placed in the Capitol Rotunda where he had a black honor guard. 40,000 mourners came to pay their respects; 20,000 were black. He chose to be buried in a cemetery that would not discriminate against the souls buried there.",5,Great Historical Insight,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,3168,"['Lincoln', 'be', 'slow', 'start', 'rapidly', 'up', 'momentum', 'man', 'trying', 'end', 'bloodshed', 'Civil', 'War', 'add', '13th', 'Amendment', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'South', 'surrenders', 'readmitted', 'Union', 'Does', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'negotiate', 'surrender', 'now', 'saving', 'countless', 'lives', 'also', 'guaranteeing', 'represented', 'South', 'will', 'surely', 'kill', 'chances', 'passage', 'amendment', 'amendment', 'slavery', 'What', 'President', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', ""n't"", 'know', 'race', 'time', 'film', 'place', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'life.In', 'order', 'get', 'amendment', 'passed', 'House', 'Representatives', 'president', 'must', 'get', 'votes', 'witness', 'horse-trading', 'deceit', 'intrigues', 'finest', 'ugliest', 'get', 'two', 'thirds', 'majority', 'required', 'next', 'step', 'process.Daniel-Day', 'Louis', 'title', 'role', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'same', 'high', 'voice', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'reported', 'have', 'frequently', 'folksy', 'charm', 'serious', 'heated', 'discussions', 'story', 'anecdote', 'adoring', 'father', 'sons', 'especially', 'younger', 'Tad', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'had', 'cleft', 'palate', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'food', 'had', 'be', 'specially', 'prepared', 'could', 'chew', 'it.Steven', 'Spielberg', 'gave', 'many', 'more', 'superb', 'performances', 'Sally', 'Field', 'bi-polar', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', '16th', 'president', 'wife', 'seen', 'still', 'under-rated', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'politically-savvy', 'Secretary', 'State', 'William', 'Seward', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'Edwin', 'M.', 'Stanton', 'Secretary', 'War', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'lines', 'film', 'No', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'story', 'earshot', 'Lincoln', 'yarn', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'continued', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Congressman', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'staunch', 'abolitionist', 'Pennsylvania', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Republican', 'politico', 'who', 'end', 'war.What', 'get', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'direction', 'attention', 'detail', 'right', 'down', 'White', 'House', 'wallpaper', 'also', 'get', 'extra', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'extra', 'Critics', 'say', 'film', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'just', 'saw', 'Lincoln', 'walking', 'down', 'hall', 'way', 'Ford', 'Theater', 'had', 'been', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'scream', 'when', 'man', 'audience', 'president', 'was', 'shot', 'final', 'scene', 'revisiting', 'Lincoln', 'Second', 'Inaugural', 'Address', 'added', 'little', 'film.Still', 'get', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'events', 'make', 'great', 'story', 'taut', 'intelligent', 'script', 'delivered', 'unparalleled', 'acting.P.S', 'movie', 'history', 'always', 'find', 'more', 'focus', 'was', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'character', 'representative', 'Pennsylvania', 'was', 'living', 'black', 'housekeeper', 'number', 'years', 'adopted', 'sons', 'offered', 'choice', '5,000', 'one', 'lump', 'sum', '500', 'year', 'ten', 'years', 'Will', 'When', 'died', 'body', 'was', 'placed', 'Capitol', 'Rotunda', 'where', 'had', 'black', 'honor', 'guard', '40,000', 'mourners', 'came', 'pay', 'respects', '20,000', 'were', 'black', 'chose', 'be', 'buried', 'cemetery', 'would', 'not', 'discriminate', 'souls', 'buried', 'there']",N/A

The reason must be the reverence many have for Lincoln as a major figure in American history and the anti-slavery issue/message.

If Lincon was actually like this portrayal, it is very hard for me to understand why he was portrayed as so popular.  This was an anachronistic interpretation of Lincoln. The portrayal is of congress as a doing nothing body, divided along strict party/ideological lines opposed to a President who is only trying to do what is ""the right thing to do."" A president who uses 'speeches' or talking to folks as his style of leadership. This has way too much flavor of what is going on here now in American politics.

1592852,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B009AMANBA,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","LINCOLN (Dir. Steven Spielberg, 2013, 150 minutes), it cannot ever be overlooked, is primarily the story about this nation's titanic struggle to pass the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery and indentured servitude. That is so salient a fact that President Lincoln (Daniel Day Lewis) seemed to be one of the lesser ""strugglers"". He came to struggle even more, due in no small part to his wife Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Fields).In this beautifully, darkly and tightly shot film, Spielberg never lets us forget that subject matter - he can ill afford it. The score by John Williams being one of the high marks (and one of his personal high-water marks) of this beautiful classic, I cannot fathom its dreadful loss at the Oscars. What can one say to that? Spielberg has undoubtedly achieved his finest film ever. Therefore, much to my relief, I will not rehearse for my review the entire stunning cast, all of whom are acting at 110%.However, I plan to grouse a bit ....The first problem you'll notice is that you either need to keep the history books at hand or be a Civil War expert just to follow the characters in this film. The storyline/plot, well, those are known history, and there's where the film gets educational, fun and interesting. Being blessed with that historical knowledge, I found I could barely keep up with the characters I was seeing. It's tough going at certain moments, and the anachronistic swearing, while hilarious as all get-out, was of little help.THE VERY BAD: There are more than a few complaints I have, as a Lincoln historian, about the Lewis interpretation of Abraham Lincoln - which I can only describe as either bad acting or just plain ""sick"". This film was based on the bookTeam of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln(one of President Barack Obama's favorite books), but I have never wholly agreed with that scholarly lady's view of Lincoln or of the behavior of the team that surrounded him in his Cabinet. They're an abominable and rude bunch, which I doubt was ever the true atmosphere at the White House or the Telegraph Office. Spielberg made the error of allowing the jungle that still is the House of Representatives spill over into the president's lap.Secondly, I have very fresh bones to pick with Lewis. In Lewis I see an essentially cold, cunning and calculating politician in the guise of President Lincoln. His voice was high-pitched and irritating, to be sure, but Lewis makes him sound as if he came down from the wilds of Minnesota - nowhere near either Kentucky, Illinois or Indiana; this in the face of Lewis' proclamation that he gave Lincoln ""a Kentucky accent"".What he did was give Walter Brennan's voice to Lincoln, and that is unforgivable because it's what I call an 'actor's cop-out'. Worse, Lewis' Lincoln is cruel, to Mary and their eldest son, galactically rude to everyday people he encounters, and at one point in the film shrieks at his Cabinet about how he is ""clothed in immense power"". Folks, Lincoln shrieked that phrase becuase he knew he was NOT so clothed. Spielberg, or perhaps Lewis, just keep getting it wrong. None of the Lincoln scenes represents Lincoln quite rightly.That is because, aside from being a truly humble, lovable and nice man who was sad and often angry, he was, as Rep. Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) puts it, ""the purest man in America"". Spielberg missed his target by avoiding the sad, pathetic Lincoln who at worst could be described as a 'vacillating Hamlet'-type figure.Whether burdened by the history, himself, Spielberg, the role or the film, Lewis fails badly all around - I do not even like him for trying because he tried THIS. Lewis seems to me to be catching at various performances of the past, and doing it badly. The physical match and perfection of the makeups is no substitute for a good actor: just look at Hal Holbrook or Sam Waterston in their old portrayals of Lincoln.All this reduces my estimation for this film, personally and deeply. However, it does not blind me to the essential need for this film. Its importance may only be marred by Spielberg's insistence on anachronistic swearing, which begins at a lusty pace sometime just before the midway mark. That rules out this film as a good family film. I thought Spielberg was pushing it with his opening scene of up-close brutality of hand-to-hand combat. But his insistence on one character habitually utilizing the f-word was just stupid.As if I cannot proclaim it enough: I think it was a gross error to cast Lewis in this, and the role ought to have gone to the original star for which it was intended: Liam Neeson, who finally begged off, pleading age, after a decade of waiting for the phone call. Imagine the difference that would have made.THE STUNNING: This film shows us the birth not only of the original liberal party (Republican) but also the birth of lobbyism and lobbyists. Seward (David Strathairn at his level best), at the behest of Lincoln and with his blessing, hires three lobbyists to get lamed reps to agree to vote for Abolition. The historical hilarity that ensues from this, what I call ""Seward's Greek Chorus"" as indeed they are in this film, well, it's priceless.The best humor comes from these three clownish men, and all I can do is direct you generally to the scenes: the lobster meal they have with Seward, the attempt of one lobbyist (a BRILLIANT James Spader) to win over a murderous representative, and of course their running commentary at certain moments in the House. With reservations, I do give Lewis high marks for relaxing into the role enough to tell a dirty joke with tremendous effectiveness.Such funny moments are balanced by the tear-inducing drama of some of Lincoln's scenes, such as his late-night conversation with Mrs. Keckley on the portico. In another scene when Mary says, ""My head hurts,"" I wept. These are the moments that prove Spielberg and his actors haven't lost their touch!In spite of its flaws, it is a film I cannot fail to own, and will own as soon as my budget allows. You would be insane to pass it up, not to have a place for it on your top DVD shelf. If it interests you, I recommend you acquire the old TV miniseriesGore Vidal's Lincoln(see my review) and see how Sam Waterston, my absolute favorite, holds up to Lewis, who is among the least of my favorite actors.REVIEWER'S NOTES: 1) I read NO reviews of this film at all and still have not; 2) I cannot understand the remarks I have heard that this was a claustrophobic film. Spielberg was trying to convey the early Victorian intimacy but he also wanted to convey the very realistic fact of President Lincoln-as-prisoner.That's all!",5,Two men I love are here: Lincoln and

However, the rest of the movie was just meh. I was bored and the sound was so soft, I couldn't hear the dialogue very well and kept increasing the volume and then the next scene was loud and had to keep turning it down. But besides the AV issues, the film focused on the amendment to abolish slavery. It was interesting how they convinced other congressmen to vote their way but mostly it was just boring. I'm sure this was an exciting time with a worthy cause, but some scenes droned on and on. At one point I left the room to take a 5 minute phone call and was going to rewind what I missed but didn't because it wouldn't have mattered. The film was overly politically correct which makes me think it was inaccurate for the time and the death scene was so quick. We all know he was shot in a theater but it would have been better if we had seen his final moments and what he may have been thinking but you just hear of his death, you don't witness it and the reaction after is short.

1592864,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B009AMANBA,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","I'd wanted to watch this movie for a long time. I thought I'd love it. I love Spielberg and his knack for telling history. I love history. But I found that while I like and enjoy this movie, I didn't quite love it.Maybe Lincoln is too iconic a figure, but Daniel Day Lewis never quite seemed to fit the man's admittedly large shoes. I think he's got the looks down, but the voice is a bit to light for me. Maybe it's historically accurate, but nothing about the voice says ""authoritative"" to me. Sometimes this works to actually humanize Lincoln a bit better. It's nice to see our greatest president depicted as human and not a myth. Lincoln does some very human things in the movie.Many have complained that the film is slow. While I normally have no patience for the movie tastes of today's ADD/hyperactivity generation, I do think there's something to this. I think part of the problem is that the film often seems to be going from one ""HUGELY IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT MOMENT"" to the next. Whether it's Lincoln telling yet another story or Stevens speaking in Congress, it feels like every moment is drawn out and important. Individually, many of the scenes are really worth taking in. But together the viewer gets the sense that the movie is going nowhere fast. There are no scenes of frantic bustling in the House of Representatives to give the impression of the passage of time or things getting done. Rather, we hear the vote of nearly every single representative on the amendment, which was a bit much. In short, it's slowness without substance.The movie was adapted from a book (Doris Kearns Goodwin's famous ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"") and it shows. There are dozens of smaller scenes scattered throughout the movie with little to no context. One of Lincoln's sons, Robert, went off to enlist in the war. We never got to know him beforehand, but it's made into a big deal. Then, afterwards, we never see him again. It seems like Spielberg thought it was an interesting scene but it doesn't fit with the story and never gets introduced or resolved.

This may very well be his best effort.Here's the scoop. The Civil War is dragging on into its fourth year. Lincoln wants to both end the war and pass the 13th amendment freeing the slaves. More than one person has told him he cannot do both. Accomplishing one will scuttle the other. He pulls out all stops to prove them wrong.This is a remarkable effort.

What I liked most was that this wasn't a biography of the man. It showed him at a specific time, performing a specific task so you got to see him as a man as well as a great politician.The production was top shelf. Costumes, hair styles, sets all transported me back to that time and place. I wasn't watching a movie. I was looking through a time portal.

1592871,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B009AMANBA,Erik North,"[33, 45]","Given the difficulties of America in the 21st century, it is oftentimes difficult to remember that America has faced much more challenging and much more tragic circumstances throughout its history.  The biggest challenge America ever faced was not a war for freedom in some faraway part of the world, but a war for freedom on its own soil.  The Civil War, in which Southern states split off from the rest of the Union over the issue of whether African-Americans should remain enslaved, tore America apart between 1861 and 1865; and only one man was able to settle the issue.  That man was Abraham Lincoln, our nation's 16th president.  The last three months of Lincoln's life, in which he managed to accomplish so much only to have it end in his assassination, is what is detailed in LINCOLN, director Steven Spielberg's impassioned and highly involved American epic.Stepping into the shoes of ""Honest Abe"" is English actor Daniel Day-Lewis, who essays a Lincoln not as we thought we knew him, with a stentorian manner of speaking, but a high, reedy-voiced man reflecting his origins in Kentucky and Illinois whose word nevertheless carried considerable gravitas, even as he presided over the messiest conflict America would ever see.  Not only does Day-Lewis preside over the immense task, after having won a second term in office, of trying to end that conflict, but also to resolve once and for all the issue of slavery by the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.  Making things worse for Day-Lewis, even members of his own cabinet, including Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) are torn on the issue of compromise with ending the Civil War and passing the amendment with the required two-thirds majority needed in the House of Representatives.  The task for Lincoln thus falls in no small measure on two prominent Northern politicians, Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) and Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), to not only keep his Republican majority in line, but also to cause twenty Democrats to defect from the hard line of keeping slavery in place, come hell or high water.  The debate in the House, particularly with Jones commanding so much attention, is as bitter and rancorous as any we've seen in our modern era; and the final vote is 119-56 (with eight abstentions, it is just enough to allow the 13th Amendment to pass).  In the end, Day-Lewis visits many of the Civil War battle sites and reflects, in the days before his violent demise, the cost of war and the battle of ideals.Spielberg had handled great American historical issues and eras before in such films as THE COLOR PURPLE, AMISTAD, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but LINCOLN was clearly a personal obsession for him; indeed, this project was twelve years in the making.  And while he may not have been that much of a history buff either in grade school, high school, or while briefly a student at Long Beach State in the late 1960s, he nevertheless developed a taste for it throughout his career.  The impact of the Holocaust as shown in SCHINDLER'S LIST is what almost certainly fired his imagination, to understand the why of that tragedy; and in LINCOLN, he does very much the same thing, in illustrating why Lincoln was so important to America, not only of his time, but of all time, leading up to the 2008 election of our nation's first African-American president.  And here, he allows Day-Lewis to give a portrait of Lincoln that rates right up there with Henry Fonda's portrayal in John Ford's 1938 film YOUNG MR, LINCOLN, and Gregory Peck's in the epic 1982 TV miniseries THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.  Sally Field is also superlative as his wife Mary Lincoln; and Holbrook and Jones, seasoned veterans both, are excellent as the men fighting the good fight.The usual excellent score by John Williams (with some period music thrown in) and the cinematography by Spielberg's usual DP Janusz Kaminski, along with the performances, make this 149 minute-long epic extremely breathless; and Tony Kushner's fine screenplay (based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book ""Team Of Rivals""), gives the cast and Spielberg plenty to work with.  As LINCOLN proves once again, Spielberg is a director capable of bringing the most difficult subject matter to dramatic life and understanding more about ourselves as human beings and as a nation at large.  Great filmmaking does that, and, without question, LINCOLN is an example of great filmmaking, certainly one of the great films of 2012.",5,Spielberg On Our 16th President,1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,4471,"['Given', 'difficulties', 'America', '21st', 'century', 'oftentimes', 'difficult', 'remember', 'America', 'faced', 'much', 'more', 'challenging', 'much', 'more', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'history', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'America', 'ever', 'faced', 'was', 'not', 'war', 'freedom', 'faraway', 'part', 'world', 'war', 'freedom', 'own', 'soil', 'Civil', 'War', 'Southern', 'states', 'split', 'off', 'rest', 'Union', 'issue', 'African-Americans', 'should', 'remain', 'enslaved', 'tore', 'America', 'apart', '1861', '1865', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'was', 'able', 'settle', 'issue', 'man', 'was', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'nation', '16th', 'president', 'last', 'three', 'months', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'managed', 'accomplish', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'have', 'end', 'assassination', 'what', 'detailed', 'LINCOLN', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'impassioned', 'highly', 'involved', 'American', 'epic.Stepping', 'shoes', 'Honest', 'Abe', 'English', 'actor', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'who', 'Lincoln', 'not', 'thought', 'knew', 'stentorian', 'manner', 'speaking', 'high', 'reedy-voiced', 'man', 'reflecting', 'origins', 'Kentucky', 'Illinois', 'word', 'nevertheless', 'carried', 'considerable', 'gravitas', 'even', 'presided', 'messiest', 'conflict', 'America', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'Not', 'only', 'Day-Lewis', 'preside', 'immense', 'task', 'having', 'won', 'second', 'term', 'office', 'trying', 'end', 'conflict', 'also', 'resolve', 'once', 'issue', 'slavery', 'ratification', '13th', 'Amendment', 'Constitution', 'Making', 'things', 'worse', 'Day-Lewis', 'even', 'members', 'own', 'cabinet', 'including', 'Secretary', 'State', 'William', 'Seward', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'are', 'torn', 'issue', 'compromise', 'ending', 'Civil', 'War', 'passing', 'amendment', 'required', 'two-thirds', 'majority', 'needed', 'House', 'Representatives', 'task', 'Lincoln', 'thus', 'small', 'measure', 'two', 'prominent', 'Northern', 'politicians', 'Preston', 'Blair', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'not', 'only', 'keep', 'Republican', 'majority', 'line', 'also', 'cause', 'twenty', 'Democrats', 'defect', 'hard', 'line', 'keeping', 'slavery', 'place', 'come', 'hell', 'high', 'water', 'debate', 'House', 'particularly', 'Jones', 'commanding', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'bitter', 'rancorous', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'modern', 'era', 'final', 'vote', '119-56', 'eight', 'abstentions', 'just', 'enough', 'allow', '13th', 'Amendment', 'pass', 'end', 'Day-Lewis', 'many', 'Civil', 'War', 'battle', 'sites', 'days', 'violent', 'demise', 'cost', 'war', 'battle', 'ideals.Spielberg', 'had', 'handled', 'great', 'American', 'historical', 'issues', 'eras', 'such', 'films', 'THE', 'COLOR', 'PURPLE', 'AMISTAD', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'LINCOLN', 'was', 'clearly', 'personal', 'obsession', 'indeed', 'project', 'was', 'twelve', 'years', 'making', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'history', 'buff', 'grade', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'briefly', 'student', 'Long', 'Beach', 'State', 'late', '1960s', 'nevertheless', 'developed', 'taste', 'career', 'impact', 'Holocaust', 'shown', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'what', 'almost', 'certainly', 'fired', 'imagination', 'understand', 'why', 'tragedy', 'LINCOLN', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'illustrating', 'why', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'America', 'not', 'only', 'time', 'time', 'leading', 'up', '2008', 'election', 'nation', 'first', 'African-American', 'president', 'here', 'Day-Lewis', 'give', 'portrait', 'Lincoln', 'rates', 'right', 'there', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Ford', '1938', 'film', 'YOUNG', 'MR', 'LINCOLN', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'epic', '1982', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'THE', 'BLUE', 'AND', 'THE', 'GRAY', 'Sally', 'Field', 'also', 'superlative', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Lincoln', 'Holbrook', 'Jones', 'seasoned', 'veterans', 'are', 'excellent', 'men', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight.The', 'usual', 'excellent', 'score', 'John', 'Williams', 'period', 'music', 'thrown', 'cinematography', 'Spielberg', 'usual', 'DP', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'performances', 'make', '149', 'minute-long', 'epic', 'extremely', 'breathless', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'fine', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Doris', 'Kearns', 'Goodwin', 'book', 'Team', 'Rivals', 'cast', 'Spielberg', 'plenty', 'work', 'LINCOLN', 'once', 'again', 'Spielberg', 'director', 'capable', 'bringing', 'most', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'dramatic', 'life', 'understanding', 'more', 'about', 'human', 'beings', 'nation', 'large', 'Great', 'filmmaking', 'question', 'LINCOLN', 'example', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'certainly', 'one', 'great', 'films', '2012']",N/A
1592872,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B009AMANBA,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[3, 4]","I've been fascinated by Abraham Lincoln my entire life. I'm sure it has to do with the fact that he was assassinated and there's quite a bit of mystery and intrigue surrounding his presidency and personal life. He did so much in his terms in office and changed our nation for the better while overcoming all sorts of political opposition. I knew I would need to see Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" as soon as it was announced in production.""Lincoln"" focuses on the man's obsession with getting the 13th Amendment pushed through Congress before the Civil War ended. Abe was honest, but would see his mission of obliterating slavery accomplished by any means necessary. His drive and the toll it took on his family life are explored in great detail.Director Steven Spielberg takes what could have been a disastrously boring two and a half hours of non-stop dialogue and somehow makes it engaging and tolerable. The success of the film is based around Spielberg's casting of Daniel Day-Lewis in the lead role. Day-Lewis owns every moment he's on screen and demands your attention with every word he speaks. He's merely the cherry on top of a brilliant and dedicated cast that includes James Spader, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Fields, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, John Hawkes, David Strathairn, and many more.Although they only took up a few moments of screen time, the scenes of the Civil War battlefields bore a lasting impression on me. The savageness of hand-to-hand combat was hard to watch. These soldiers fought hand-to-hand, which made it more personal. It wasn't a faceless war like today's, where we just drop bombs on each other and never have direct contact with the people we're fighting.""Lincoln's"" high-definition audio and video transfer couldn't be any better. The picture gives viewers the best visual experience possible and highlights the extravagant set and costume designs. The 7.1 surround sound guarantees every uttered piece of dialogue, whispered or shouted, is heard over John Williams' incredible score. The battle scene is effectively chaotic, noisy, and nerve-wracking as well.There are two short featurettes included in the 2-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack. Steven Spielberg and his team of filmmakers discuss the shooting location and making of the film in ""The Journey to 'Lincoln'"" and ""A Historic Tapestry: Richmond, Virginia.""

There's so much to like... the acting was exceptional (by all!), the set and costume design were top notch, the musical score (by none other than the brilliant John Williams) was beautiful and the dialog was clever/wonderful.  The film is based on the book ""Team of Rivals:  The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" by author, historian and Pulitzer-Prize winner Doris Kearns Goodwin who has chronicled the political lives of other past American Presidents.  Essentially, ""Lincoln"" is about the passage of the 13th Amendment (after the Emancipation Proclamation had already passed and he had been re-elected) and how difficult it was for President Lincoln to get members of his party and even of his cabinet to pass it.  Clearly some artistic liberty had to be taken with various parts of the movie's dialogue, but the House of Representatives dialog where many of its members would publicly stand to address each other and the issues at hand must have been accurate due to the reporters in the chamber!  The reporters were the public record keepers writing down the words of the congressmen and publishing them in all of the popular and well regarded newspapers of the day which are probably available  (perhaps at the Library of Congress?) for public viewing.I don't know what other movies will be competing for movie of the year or who will be competing for Oscars with Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones, but I sure hope this movie wins big.

1592883,A1LTKJ9UTZ9NVI,B009AMANBA,Filmaholics Anyonymous,"[2, 11]","This will be a very brief review. Steven Spielberg was obviously Oscar-hungry during the production of Lincoln. This film is a horribly wasted opportunity to shed light on one of America's most interesting presidents in one of America's most turbulent of times. Instead of showcasing something honest, gripping, or even titillating, Spielberg uses this time to cater to the already initiated ranks of the most rigidly corrupt brotherhood in all of art, The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences. I'm not sure if Spielberg ever had a brave bone in his body, but after watching Lincoln, I wonder if he even has a soul. Lincoln is a soulless film. It is very difficult to make a film that deals with all of the interesting historical events that Lincoln is centered around boring, but Spielberg seems to do that effortlessly. What's more, Daniel Day Lewis churns out a boring and half-hearted performance, as do most of the actors in the piece! Its as if Lincoln was made by a half-interested company for a built in audience that were completely uninterested in fanciful concepts like intimacy, empathy, and courage.Lincoln is not a film, it is an instructional video for all future hack-job directors on how to make a movie about something as multi-faceted as the presidency of Abraham Lincoln seem watered-down, hokey, and as accessible to as many people as possible. Ken Burns should have been an adviser on the film in some capacity, as he seems to know a thing or two about intimacy and courage. Spielberg never tried to give us anything more than the bare minimum the Academy required of him. He didn't even try to give us one actually fleshed out and interesting character. I know he can take a historical event and present it in a brave and intimate way, how Spielberg treated Schindler's List is a great example of what I'm talking about. Spielberg made a brave film then, not just something the Academy wanted, but something that he wanted.

1592886,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B009AMANBA,FNDNreview,"[3, 4]","Since the day a tyrant's bullet took him from our nation, Abraham Lincoln has been immortalized by a wide variety of mediums - ranging from one very impressive marble statue to countless impersonations, not to mention several films and television portrayals.  Because of the Lincoln myths, he is one of our America's most recognizable faces and is arguably the most important president in the history of the United States.  More books have been written about Abraham Lincoln than anyone other president, and still to this day authors and historians continue to make discoveries about The Great Emancipator.Discoveries aside, it's also fun to emulate visions of Lincoln as more than just a man - but also a superhero. In Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, he is portrayed as the man that freed the slaves, as well as the man that helped defeat the vampires. However, on a more serious note, another recent film - The Conspirator tells the post assassination story of Mary Surratt, the first woman in American history to die by a hangman's noose just for being in the same house as John Wilkes Booth as he planned Lincoln's demise. So you see, it's not just Lincoln that's famous - it's anyone that's ever had anything to do with him.  And, now that Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis have decided to show us their take on Mr. Lincoln, they will most likely go down in history as the two men that gave us the best interpretation of the 16th president to date - in the 2012 film, Lincoln.Steven Spielberg directs Lincoln, based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, which gives a condensed version of the months leading up the vote on the 13th Amendment - a vote to abolish slavery.  Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) is only a few months into his second term as the Civil War winds to a close, but the issue of slavery is still front and center.  President Lincoln pushes his cabinet to find the votes in the House of Representatives to add an amendment to the constitution, putting an end to slavery once and for all.  Back door dealings, personal loss, and family turmoil are the backdrops as Lincoln struggles with some of the most stressful months in American history.Already earning him several prestigious awards, including a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a drama for his portrayal in Lincoln, Daniel Day-Lewis will most likely also earn himself another Academy Award for Best Actor.  After years of studying Abraham Lincoln, Spielberg went to great lengths to make this film one of the most realistic portrayal of Lincoln to date, including creating some of the most elaborate settings that cinema has ever seen.  This film is meant to show an aged, run-down Lincoln during one of the most tumultuous periods in United States history.  And, who better to an actor than Daniel Day-Lewis for the role of Lincoln?  From his real-life high pitched voice, Day-Lewis does a spectacular job of showing Lincoln as a conflicted, yet melancholy man who refuses to give in to failure.  The future of the union rested on one man's shoulders - a future destined to end in greatness, and tragedy.Top to bottom, Lincoln's cast is an absolute marvel.  Sally Field gives an Oscar-worthy portrayal of Mary Todd Lincoln, an overly depressed, angry woman dealing with her own inner demons.  After the loss of a child, Willy (not seen in the film) and her unwillingness to lose her oldest to the war, we are given our first real cinematic glimpse at the tragic downfall of Mary-Todd Lincoln, prior to the death of her husband.  Also starring in the film is Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, an elder, radical Republican dead-set on abolishing slavery.  The role of Stevens has also garnered Jones a great deal of acclaim.  Jones' ability to steal a scene is masterful and it's quite possible he's Oscar-bound in the supporting actor category.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Robert Todd Lincoln), David Strathairn (William Seward), Hal Holbrook (Francis Preston Blair) and James Spader (Rep. William Biblo) also shine in their respective roles.As previously review when the film was initially released, it seemed the only downside about this film was the length of the film.  Running at an estimated 2 hours and 30 minutes, it can feel a whole lot longer than it is for anyone that doesn't have a heavy interest in Lincoln or history.  While this is a biographical film, it is not a film about Lincoln's entire life - and mainly focuses on the passage of the 13th Amendment.  The span of this film is only over a few months and certain scenes can feel like they drag more than others, however, the emotional payoff is well worth the wait.Overall, this is not a film for everyone - but it should at least been seen by everyone.  It is a superb work of art by Steven Spielberg and all of the actors involved.  Still, it doesn't qualify well for date night.  Yes, there will always be more entertaining films out there with more action, laughs, and crash scenes.  At the end of the day, Lincoln is about one man's dream for the direction of the United States.  It's about a man that suffers all his life through depression, but fought through it to reunite a nation.  This is a far more emotionally-charged and meaningful film that any other film in theaters.  Lincoln comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Spielberg fans, history buffs, and Lincoln enthusiasts - and should be seen by everyone at least once, especially the young person sitting in classrooms right now.Overall Film Grade:  A+FNDNreview.com",5,'Lincoln' a masterful work of art,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,5527,"['day', 'tyrant', 'bullet', 'took', 'nation', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'been',

His leadership in this conundrum of a civil war is the reason that the country as we know it exists today.

For some reason, I had it in my head that one of the most characteristic traits of Lincoln was his deep sonorous voice.How did I get that impression?  Grade school indoctrination, perhaps.  Perhaps envisioning those powerfully worded speeches being delivered simply cast them in an authoritatively deep voice in my mind.  Further research indicates that this tall, lanky man was indeed a tenor.So, I have to get past that, which is harder than it should be.But, I think even that superficial misperception underscores how difficult it is to really understand the uncertainties of that period of American history.  We can look back after it's all settled and nod our heads, but how it would all turn out was a much bigger question in the day it was happening.The portrayal focuses on the slavery issue, but the real issue to Lincoln was the preservation of the union, which he was willing to enforce at any cost - including suspending the constitution and ignoring the fact that the southern states had ratified the constitution only with the proviso that they could secede.  Slavery was secondary (he certainly was vehemently opposed to it), and was adopted enthusiastically late in the war - mainly as a propaganda to maintain public support for a conflict that had dragged out much longer and become much more vicious than anyone had anticipated.We like to think of the ultimate outcome of the war as the abolition of slavery, but perhaps a more pernicious outcome was centralization of power in the federal government - a centralization that has continued to expand to proportions that extend into almost every aspect of life, today, and has for all intents and purposes usurped the sovereignty of the states.  An expansion that is increasingly accepted and even desired by a population with much different expectations of the nature and role of government from that of the 1860's.The interaction between Lincoln and Mary is explored interestingly, but how accurately is anyone's guess.Bears more analysis, I think.",4,Unexpected,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,2090,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'high', 'voice', 'reason', 'had', 'head', 'one', 'most', 'characteristic', 'traits', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'deep', 'sonorous', 'voice.How', 'did', 'get', 'impression', 'Grade', 'school', 'indoctrination', 'perhaps', 'Perhaps', 'envisioning', 'powerfully', 'worded', 'speeches', 'being', 'delivered', 'simply', 'cast', 'authoritatively', 'deep', 'voice', 'mind', 'Further', 'research', 'tall', 'lanky', 'man', 'was', 'indeed', 'tenor.So', 'have', 'get', 'past', 'harder', 'should', 'be.But', 'think', 'even', 'superficial', 'misperception', 'how', 'difficult', 'really', 'understand', 'uncertainties', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'settled', 'nod', 'heads', 'how', 'would', 'all', 'turn', 'out', 'was', 'much', 'bigger', 'question', 'day', 'was', 'happening.The', 'portrayal', 'focuses', 'slavery', 'issue', 'real', 'issue', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'preservation', 'union', 'was', 'willing', 'enforce', 'cost', 'including', 'suspending', 'constitution', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'southern', 'states', 'had', 'ratified', 'constitution', 'only', 'proviso', 'could', 'secede', 'Slavery', 'was', 'secondary', 'certainly', 'was', 'vehemently', 'opposed', 'was', 'adopted', 'enthusiastically', 'late', 'war', 'mainly', 'propaganda', 'maintain', 'public', 'support', 'conflict', 'had', 'dragged', 'out', 'much', 'longer', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'vicious', 'anyone', 'had', 'anticipated.We', 'think', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'war', 'abolition', 'slavery', 'perhaps', 'more', 'pernicious', 'outcome', 'was', 'centralization', 'power', 'federal', 'government', 'centralization', 'continued', 'expand', 'proportions', 'extend', 'almost', 'aspect', 'life', 'today', 'intents', 'purposes', 'usurped', 'sovereignty', 'states', 'expansion', 'increasingly', 'accepted', 'even', 'desired', 'population', 'much', 'different', 'expectations', 'nature', 'role', 'government', ""1860's.The"", 'interaction', 'Lincoln', 'Mary', 'explored', 'interestingly', 'how', 'accurately', 'anyone', 'guess.Bears', 'more', 'analysis', 'think']",N/A

1592907,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B009AMANBA,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[29, 34]","LINCOLN is a film with brilliant performances, flawless art design, a stilted script, and an unimpressive plot.  It is akin to looking at dead flowers pressed in a book for two and a half hours.Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) is arguably the greatest of the American presidents, but you get little sense of that from this 2012 Steven Spielberg film, which focuses very narrowly on the presidents determination to shepherd the thirteenth amendment through a polarized House of Representatives and thereby abolish slavery in the United States.  In consequence, the film consists of an endless array of political plots and counterplots, back room arm twisting, public bickering--most of it presented with a lack of interest that renders the film increasingly tedious.If the great failings are the script and direction, the great successes are in the performances.  The sparkling highlight of the film is a very unexpected performance by Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln.  I never questioned her performance, and although her screen time is limited, she conveys the complexities of this most complicated of first ladies beyond any possible skepticism.  In watching her performance, you never think of Sally Field playing Mary Todd Lincoln; you only think of Mary Todd Lincoln.  It is an astonishing achievement.  In contrast, the script significantly underserves Daniel Day-Lewis.  Although he has considerably more screen time than Field, he seems less complex than one expects, and while I never questioned his performance I often wished it had more scope.  The same is largely true of the rest of the cast, who seem hemmed in the constraints of the ""let's pass the thirteenth amendment"" story.In addition to its performances, the film is remarkable in terms of art direction.  It possesses an attention to visual detail that few other films have, from Mary Todd Lincoln's jet jewelry to Abraham Lincoln's inevitably unruly hair.  From fire light to candle light, from horse and buggy to battle weapons, you really feel that this is how it looked and sounded.  Unfortunately, this attention to detail is quite frequently undercut by the script, which has an unfortunate way of alternating between speech that sounds correct for 1865 and speech that sounds more like 2012.  It is an awkward amalgamation.  As for historical inaccuracy, I leave the battle to the experts--and, quite typically, none of them really agree.Bonuses depend on what version of the DVD you purchase.  The single disk version offers a making of documentary that is worth watching, but nothing more.  The elements are pristine.  But in the end, one has to ask: is this movie really worth watching?  My answer to that would be yes, but it is qualified yes.  It is a movie worth watching, certainly, but not necessarily a movie worth re-watching.  You may prefer to rent it than own it, for one viewing will likely be enough.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Brilliant Performances Undercut By Stilted Script,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,2909,"['LINCOLN', 'film', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'flawless', 'art', 'design', 'stilted', 'script', 'unimpressive', 'plot', 'akin', 'looking', 'dead', 'flowers', 'pressed', 'book', 'two', 'half', 'hours.Abraham', 'Lincoln', '1809-1865', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'American', 'presidents', 'get', 'little', 'sense', '2012', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'very', 'narrowly', 'presidents', 'determination', 'shepherd', 'thirteenth', 'amendment', 'polarized', 'House', 'Representatives', 'thereby', 'abolish', 'slavery', 'United', 'States', 'consequence', 'film', 'endless', 'array', 'political', 'plots', 'counterplots', 'back', 'room', 'arm', 'twisting', 'public', 'bickering', 'most', 'presented', 'lack', 'interest', 'film', 'increasingly', 'great', 'failings', 'are', 'script', 'direction', 'great', 'successes', 'are', 'performances', 'sparkling', 'highlight', 'film', 'very', 'unexpected', 'performance', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'never', 'questioned', 'performance', 'screen', 'time', 'limited', 'conveys', 'complexities', 'most', 'complicated', 'first', 'ladies', 'possible', 'skepticism', 'watching', 'performance', 'never', 'think', 'Sally', 'Field', 'playing', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'only', 'think', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'astonishing', 'achievement', 'contrast', 'script', 'significantly', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'considerably', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Field', 'less', 'complex', 'one', 'never', 'questioned', 'performance', 'often', 'wished', 'had', 'more', 'scope', 'same', 'largely', 'true', 'rest', 'cast', 'who', 'seem', 'hemmed', 'constraints', 'let', 'pass', 'thirteenth', 'amendment', 'story.In', 'addition', 'performances', 'film', 'remarkable', 'terms', 'art', 'direction', 'attention', 'visual', 'detail', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'jet', 'jewelry', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'inevitably', 'unruly', 'hair', 'fire', 'light', 'candle', 'light', 'horse', 'buggy', 'battle', 'weapons', 'really', 'feel', 'how', 'looked', 'sounded', 'Unfortunately', 'attention', 'detail', 'quite', 'frequently', 'undercut', 'script', 'unfortunate', 'way', 'alternating', 'speech', 'correct', '1865', 'speech', 'more', '2012', 'awkward', 'amalgamation', 'historical', 'inaccuracy', 'leave', 'battle', 'experts', 'quite', 'typically', 'none', 'really', 'depend', 'what', 'version', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'single', 'disk', 'version', 'making', 'documentary', 'worth', 'watching', 'nothing', 'more', 'elements', 'are', 'pristine', 'end', 'one', 'ask', 'movie', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'answer', 'would', 'be', 'yes', 'qualified', 'yes', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'certainly', 'not', 'necessarily', 'movie', 're-watching', 'may', 'prefer', 'rent', 'one', 'viewing', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'enough.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Not when the subject involves so many antecedents and complexities. I couldn't imagine doing the film, or myself, justice within the scope of a few hundred words. However, an amazon friend, a citizen of Germany working in China, has sent me a request to explain why I found this film so successful. Here's my answer, which I might as well share:""You might need to have spent some of your youth celebrating Lincoln's birthday, or noticing Lincoln's picture on the penny, or reading some of the pop boys' books about the War. You might need to have read Walt Whitman's Civil War poetry, especially ""When Lilacs Last etc"", and more than once. Lincoln is a powerful shamanic totemic figure in the American mind, and seeing him made human by DDL is like being told yes, there is a heaven for pets or yes any child can become president. But the film handles the assassination with the greatest cinematic subtlety. Of course I've know about the assassination in great detail all my reading life. Of course I know the Gettysburg Address by heart (though generations younger than I am probably don't). Well, there came that moment in the film when the capstone had been placed, when the passage of the 13th Amendment had been achieved -- and any blathering fool who still argues that ""the War was not about slavery"" should have his mouth taped shut as teachers used to do in the USA in 'the good old days' -- that moment when in effect Lincoln had become immortal morally, and at that moment I sat in the theater agonized by foreknowledge, horrified by anticipating the next scene, which could only be the assassination. Oh no! No! Not now! let the Glory wave a short while! I'm not a guy who cries in cinemas, but I couldn't stop myself from bawling as if a close friend or sib were dying in my arms. Lincoln's death became a personal tragedy for me, for the first brief time, at that moment in the film. My dry historical awareness of the tragedy will never be merely intellectual again. Wait! Not yet! Spare me the scene of his death! I WANT HIM TO LIVE!And the film did spare us. The indirect treatment of the assassination was superb, humane, decent film-making. Proof, I'd argue, that ""less"" is sometimes ""more"", that dispassion can be more poignant than blaring cinemascopic 3-D amped-up violence.Perhaps not everyone in the audience was as affected as I was. There are people who quibble with DDL's portrayal of Lincoln as insufficiently awesome. There are people who ardently despise Lincoln as a tyrant and desecrator of ""our"" Constitution. My response to the film was personal and private, linked to my own life experience in the Civil Rights movement. But that response was more intense than I expected when I bought my ticket. More intense than at any film I've seen in many years.""",5,I Didn't Plan to Write a Review ...,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2862,"['Not', 'when', 'are', 'already', 'dozens', 'reviews', 'excellent', 'abysmal', 'Not', 'when', 'subject', 'so', 'many', 'antecedents', 'complexities', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'doing', 'film', 'justice', 'scope', 'few', 'hundred', 'words', 'However', 'amazon', 'friend', 'citizen', 'Germany', 'working', 'China', 'sent', 'request', 'explain', 'why', 'found', 'film', 'so', 'successful', 'Here', 'answer', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'share', 'might', 'need', 'have', 'spent', 'youth', 'celebrating', 'Lincoln', 'birthday', 'noticing', 'Lincoln', 'picture', 'penny', 'reading', 'pop', 'books', 'War', 'might', 'need', 'have', 'read', 'Walt', 'Whitman', 'Civil', 'War', 'poetry', 'especially', 'When', 'Lilacs', 'Last', 'etc', 'more', 'once', 'Lincoln', 'powerful', 'shamanic', 'totemic', 'figure', 'American', 'mind', 'seeing', 'made', 'human', 'DDL', 'being', 'told', 'yes', 'heaven', 'pets', 'yes', 'child', 'can', 'become', 'president', 'film', 'assassination', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'subtlety', 'course', ""'ve"", 'know', 'assassination', 'great', 'detail', 'reading', 'life', 'course', 'know', 'Gettysburg', 'Address', 'heart', 'generations', 'younger', 'am', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'Well', 'came', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'capstone', 'had', 'been', 'placed', 'when', 'passage', '13th', 'Amendment', 'had', 'been', 'achieved', 'blathering', 'fool', 'who', 'still', 'War', 'was', 'not', 'slavery', 'should', 'have', 'mouth', 'taped', 'shut', 'teachers', 'used', 'do', 'USA', ""'the"", 'good', 'old', 'days', 'moment', 'when', 'effect', 'Lincoln', 'had', 'become', 'immortal', 'morally', 'moment', 'sat', 'theater', 'agonized', 'foreknowledge', 'horrified', 'anticipating', 'next', 'scene', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'assassination', 'Oh', 'No', 'Not', 'now', 'let', 'Glory', 'wave', 'short', ""'m"", 'not', 'guy', 'who', 'cinemas', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'bawling', 'close', 'friend', 'sib', 'were', 'dying', 'arms', 'Lincoln', 'death', 'became', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'first', 'brief', 'time', 'moment', 'film', 'dry', 'historical', 'awareness', 'tragedy', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'merely', 'intellectual', 'again', 'Wait', 'Not', 'yet', 'Spare', 'scene', 'death', 'WANT', 'HIM', 'TO', 'LIVE', 'film', 'did', 'spare', 'indirect', 'treatment', 'assassination', 'was', 'superb', 'humane', 'decent', 'film-making', 'Proof', ""'d"", 'argue', 'less', 'sometimes', 'more', 'dispassion', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'poignant', 'blaring', 'cinemascopic', '3-D', 'amped-up', 'violence.Perhaps', 'not', 'everyone', 'audience', 'was', 'as', 'affected', 'was', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'quibble', 'DDL', 'portrayal', 'Lincoln', 'insufficiently', 'awesome', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'ardently', 'despise', 'Lincoln', 'tyrant', 'desecrator', 'Constitution', 'response', 'film', 'was', 'personal', 'private', 'linked', 'own', 'life', 'experience', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'response', 'was', 'more', 'intense', 'expected', 'when', 'bought', 'ticket', 'More', 'intense', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'years']",N/A

He completely transforms himself into Abraham Lincoln and captures the many sides of a complicated man and President.The film itself is quite engrossing - especially when you consider it is essentially a 2-and-a-half hour movie about Congressional vote wrangling (and one where the viewer already knows the final outcome).  Credit goes to screenwriter Kushner, who has managed to capture the import of the vote and the subtle ways in which Lincoln could cajole and arm-twist using his resolve, his humor, and his natural charisma.  After watching this you will really feel as if you know Lincoln the man better than you ever did through a history book, and that is high praise for any biographical film.My only quibble is with the ending.  The film ends just after Lincoln has been assassinated - I doubt that qualifies as a spoiler - and I wish there was a little more time devoted to this.  It is passed over so quickly that Lincoln's death has little emotional impact in the film... Instead there is a brief flashback of Lincoln delivering a speech, and then the movie fades to black. My suspicion is that Spielberg was trying to focus on his tremendous accomplishment in abolishing slavery, which would far outlive his mortal life and in a sense lessen the tragedy of his death.  I just felt that this great man's death deserved a little more import in the film, and it made the ending somewhat unsatisfying.At any rate it is an excellent film and definitely worth watching for Day-Lewis's amazing performance.",4,Day-Lewis is amazing as Lincoln,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,1640,"['accolades', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'portrayal', 'Lincoln', 'are', 'well-deserved', 'really', 'as', 'good', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'completely', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'many', 'sides', 'complicated', 'man', 'President.The', 'film', 'quite', 'engrossing', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'essentially', '2-and-a-half', 'hour', 'movie', 'Congressional', 'vote', 'wrangling', 'one', 'where', 'viewer', 'already', 'final', 'outcome', 'Credit', 'screenwriter', 'Kushner', 'who', 'managed', 'capture', 'import', 'vote', 'subtle', 'ways', 'Lincoln', 'could', 'cajole', 'arm-twist', 'using', 'resolve', 'humor', 'natural', 'charisma', 'watching', 'will', 'really', 'feel', 'know', 'Lincoln', 'man', 'better', 'ever', 'did', 'history', 'book', 'high', 'praise', 'biographical', 'film.My', 'only', 'quibble', 'ending', 'film', 'just', 'Lincoln', 'been', 'assassinated', 'doubt', 'spoiler', 'wish', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'devoted', 'passed', 'so', 'quickly', 'Lincoln', 'death', 'little', 'emotional', 'impact', 'film', 'Instead', 'brief', 'flashback', 'Lincoln', 'delivering', 'speech', 'then', 'movie', 'black', 'suspicion', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'trying', 'focus', 'tremendous', 'accomplishment', 'abolishing', 'slavery', 'would', 'far', 'outlive', 'mortal', 'life', 'sense', 'tragedy', 'death', 'just', 'felt', 'great', 'man', 'death', 'deserved', 'little', 'more', 'import', 'film', 'made', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'unsatisfying.At', 'rate', 'excellent', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'Day-Lewis', 'amazing', 'performance']",N/A

It seems that Steven Spielberg joining hands with the national hero Abraham Lincoln and the racial equality issue is a sacred marriage and to offer dissident views of the film as a film approaches sacrilege.The film is basically the last four months of Abraham Lincoln's life and the manner in which he struggled to end the war and pass the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery only to be assassinated at Ford's theater For this viewer the strongest aspect of the film is Tony Kushner's magnificent script, a script that places words befitting the times in the mouths of the men and women surrounding the final days of the war and the contentious governmental debate about slavery.  It is pungent, poetic, inspiring, both raw and refined, and captures an era and a time in this country's history that will be difficult to match.Yes, the cast is strong - massively collected from among some of the finest actors in film today. Everyone has crowned the head of Daniel Day-Lewis for his portrayal of Lincoln and Sally Fields as his borderline adjusted wife Mary and Tommy Lee Jones as the acerbic and convincingly committed Thaddeus Stevens, but the others in the cast deserve listing: David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Robert Latham, Bruce McGill, Tim Blake Nelson, Lee Pace, Boris McGiver, David Costabile, Stephen Spinella, Colman Domingo, David Oyelowo, Lukas Haas and on and on.The battle scenes are as atrocious as war is atrocious and the lighting and camera work throughout the film capture that dark period in our history magnificently. Doubtless the film will always be regarded as perfect, but for some it is overly long, occasionally pretentious, at times trying - but always rescued by Tony Kushner's fine screenplay adaptation of Doris Kearns Goodwin's novel `Team of Rivals'.

Production values fill the screen from the first shot to the final frame.Forging a lasting work to be sustained in the multitude of films, books, videos, documentaries, docudramas, etc., that form the Lincoln canon is a challenge in itself.  Director Spielberg plays well to the task, knowing he will be expected, but even more, desiring through his love of film, to chronicle history that will be sustained.His choice of Day-Lewis for the rail-splitter becomes obviously inspired from the moment Daniel appears.  Preoccupation with the minutia of daily life was brilliantly captivating, giving one that marvelous perspective of being the famed 'fly-on-the-wall.'  Film aficionados will study this movie with relish.Day-Lewis' hunched-back, reedy colloquialisms framing perspectives from scholarly promontories distinguish the living portrait, hungering the audience for more.Stellar performances abound, dripping over one another like honey over cake.  That viewers are forced to demand if this or that was truly historical only hammers home the realities that were found.

With all its battle scenes and meticulous costuming and art direction, ultimately it's a people story brimming with characters and human conflicts. The trademark Spielberg back-lighting and other touches are very much in evidence, but the director does not take center stage and allows his cast to shine.And shine they do. I can't add anything to the praise earned by Daniel Day-Lewis, who redifined Lincoln to millions who either remember early depictions by Henry Fonda or Raymond Massey, TV miniseries with actors like Hal Holbrook (who appears in this film as well) and perhaps most significantly, Royal Dano's voice and the Audio-Animatronics version at Disney Parks on both coasts -- a characterization that has been in the mass mindset since the 1964 New York World's Fair.Lots has been said about Lincoln's voice, but I had no problem with that. He also comes off as a little bit of an eccentric, whose numerous stories and long jokes cause sighs and eye rolls among his staff and associates. In Literature 101 terms, he would be called the ""Christ-like figure,"" speaking in parables to make his points and even dying at the end (hope that's not a spoiler!)Sally Field, because she simply cannot be unlikable, brings that quality to Mary Todd Lincoln. She's never a villain or a harpy. She doesn't quite disappear into her role as Day-Lewis does -- for Pete's sake, it's Sally Field, whom we've loved for over four decades! Perhaps for that reason, and some powerful acting, few could create the Mary that she does. The argument scene between husband and wife is electrifying.Why did I say this movie isn't about Lincoln? Because I believe it's more about the people few of us know about. From the African-American soldiers to those three frazzled men who risk wrath and even shooting to get support for the Amendment. Tommy Lee Jones' character isn't legendary, yet he spent his life trying to abolish slavery. And the remarkable David Strathairn -- perhaps Hollywood's most underrated actor -- is a standout as Secretary of State Seward. Everyone, regardless of their walk of life, can share the accomplishment. Lincoln of course, is the ultimate in leadership, but it's nice to see the little guys and ladies get their spotlight, too.There is no commentary. Like War Horse, Spielberg offers his comments in bonus documentaries. Unlike the War Horse home release, the docs are shorter, but certainly fascinating and worth watching.

Tomer,"[0, 1]","Especially for people whose families were in the Americas long before the Revolutionary War, but who were not included in 1787 when citizenship began, I highly recommend this particular cinematic version of President Lincoln. The story is well-known; however, the inclusion of other historic figures, such as Stevens from PA, who played pivotal roles to unify the country was something high school students could later become history majors in college. Inspiration from taking the heat in the Congress while advocating rights to the most repressed groups in America? Read more of Thaddeus Stevens!Native People, African Americans, Hispanic & Franco Americans were all denied, despite the many treaties as America implemented its own form of Nationhood. President Jefferson called his policies of militaristic genocide toward Native people ""incorporation."" Meaning, if you give us your lands, deny your way of life, accept Christianity, and sign this ""treaty,"" we will call you citizen with no rights while we march you further west. Keep praying, keep marching? By the time of Abraham Lincoln, black slaves were no longer economical investments: absolute social order and control was necessary to continue separating the North & South divisions.Spain, France, and their own promises to cultural regions were insignificant to America's westward thrust and conquer. Of all the treaties with France & Spain promising full rights as citizens and to hold lands in America with free passage to and from?? Why are we still waiting for the 22d Century to grant such treaty rights? Yet, the movie ""Abraham Lincoln"" tells us: it's in the many lifeless bodies. Somehow, we can understand his pain ... Then, to the west with trains: Asians slave & their rights are denied by State laws and eager courts, especially the U.S. Supreme Court.The Congress sits, deliberates, and the ardent elite politicians play every measured angle while the Civil War continues past the Great Signing at Appomattox. While the elite, white men gather their thoughts, America continues in near collapse. The religious minorities, like the racial and ethnic minorities, struggle for acceptance; the whole country struggles to regain a sense of ""country."" The feeling of Country in the 16th - 18th century was something understood by White America. Hence, citizenship was never questioned in 1787.However, by the end of the Civil War, it was no longer clear what citizenship meant. The amendments: the 13th, 14th, and the Civil Rights Acts, with the power to enforce, were the absolute to stop the prevalent violence in America. The War had continued; only, most Americans have never considered hearing it from their ""minority"" friends. Hell, the country was barely productive without the enslaving railroads that stole Indian lands, and would later destroy labor unions with military support. Carnegie bought European technology, and without immigrants to supply the intellect, even the trains, electricity, and later the automobiles would have been delayed.Lincoln traveled on a timeless ship: it was powered by his pure mind and devout belief in God. As he sailed in his dream, we saw only a portion, I am positive he envisioned our time. Not much has really changed: the religious, racial, ethnic, cultural, and sexual minorities still strive for acceptance and commerce; the white elite still control the purse strings & companies - now reaching international; and, the Hispanic & Franco populations still wait for the U.S. Congress and their unforgotten promises.As a Black man sits in the White House, a highly educated and talented man and his family, we watch an imprisoned man cautioned by the ruling class and their Press.

1592934,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B009AMANBA,HAMLET,"[3, 36]","Caution: May Contain Spoilers. I saw ""Lincoln"" yesterday with my two closest friends, and... Before I get into that, I just have to mention that the show time I had planned to see the film at was sold out (I'd expected that for the final installment of ""Twilight,"" but not for ""Lincoln""), and the theater house where the 4:50 show of ""Lincoln"" was playing was almost entirely packed, I kid you not. I was surprised, as I thought most people wouldn't be interested in a historical drama, but at the same time, I was pleased at the turnout for the movie.Now to what I think of the movie. ""Lincoln"" is a well-acted, well-directed and more or less well-written depiction of the days in January and several days of April 1865 where President Lincoln struggles with his divided Cabinet to get the Thirteenth Amendment ratified. The opening scene is all the glimpse we get of the Civil War. The remainder of the movie is straight-up talk. Don't let that stop you from experiencing this monumental motion picture, though. Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones play Abraham Lincoln, Mary Todd Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens very well. I think we can expect Academy Award nominations for all three of them come Oscar time. Other actors who give good performances in the limited screen time they have are Gloria Reuben (ER) as Elizabeth Keckley, confidant and dress-maker to Mary Todd Lincoln, Jared Harris (""Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows"") as General Ulysses S. Grant, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Angels In The Outfield,"" ""The Dark Knight Rises"") as Robert Todd Lincoln, S. Epatha Merkenson as Thaddeus Stevens"" housekeeper, James Spader as W. N. Bilbo, David Straithairn as Secretary Of State William Seward and Hal Holbrook as Senator Preston Blair.The music by John Williams is excellent and perfectly captures the mood of the era. There are some light-hearted moments to balance the heavy drama, which includes grieving over the loss of a beloved son a few years earlier. Younger children who see this film may find those moments difficult to understand. Content-wise, though, the film has some problems. The intense scene of war violence and a brief scene of severed limbs being thrown into a pit, along with several uses of the N-word are historically accurate to the time period, and were, I felt, not thrown in to shock viewers.The combining of God's Name with a mild curse word is unfortunate, however. That may be how people spoke back then, though infrequently, but it can always be implied (a sound like a whistle or a mill or somebody falling muffling the blasphemy) if necessary. The throwing in of an f-word or two is also unfortunate, but the one time it's clearly audible it is done in a humorous context, and I felt was not thrown in for shock value.With the above-content enumerated, I recommend this film, which may be of particular interest for history buffs. For those interested in a film that depicts the Civil War, but without the gory violence and pervasive language so prevalent in war movies these days, I recommend ""Gods And Generals"" and ""Gettysburg."" Both films have excellent acting, gripping storylines, well-written characters, beautiful musical scores, a strong commitment to historical accuracy (both movies were produced by Ted Turner, a Civil War buff) and most importantly, respect for God by both sides, North and South. ""Gods And Generals,"" the prequel is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of war violence. ""Gettysburg,"" made almost a decade earlier, is rated PG for intense war sequences and some language.2nd Note: I have since found out that President Lincoln strongly disapproved of profanity, and I regret going to view this movie in the theaters. Plus, the screenwriter likes men.EDIT - 3/4/13I stand by everything I said above. I just want to add something. The f-word was rarely, if ever, used in the 19th century. In fact, it was so infrequently said that the word did not appear in American dictionaries until 1965, 100 years after the end of the Civil War. Plus, Lincoln rarely, if ever, used profanity, and I very much doubt that he swore, as depicted in the film (ie. combining God's Name with a mild profanity, thereby turning it into a strong religious profanity). The fact that the screenwriter, who is a man, is living with a man is also a huge issue for me, which I am not here to debate or discuss. However, I bring it up because that's been pointed out in almost every news article and one Q&A; video about the film. It also means that those who pay money to view this movie, as I stupidly did, are thereby contributing to their perversions.",3,Well-Directed & Well-Acted Drama Depicting The Struggle For Slavery's End.

This film adaptation will be a blockbuster.DVD SUBTITLES in English, Spanish, and French.Much will be said of the near perfection in stature and acting of Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of Lincoln. He plays the statesman, the angry husband, Christian, a manipulator, and a heart-wrenching depiction of loving father. Crawling on the floor to his sleeping son before the fire hearth brings a near tear.Sally Fields gives what surely will be a nominated performance as Lincoln's wife, elevating her acting career to another new height.The list of stars and significant performance highlights is endless.

1592950,A16ALBDRKYUZ15,B009AMANBA,Hugh Claffey,"[16, 48]","I saw Zero Dark Thirty in the same week as I saw this film, in both cases I had a good idea of the plot beforehand, yet the Bin Laden movie was gripping and dramatic, whereas Lincoln was leaden.But first the good bits, it definitely made me want to read the book Team of Rivals.  The details of why Lincoln needed the Amendment, after he had declared Emancipation are well explained,  (though not really through Dialogue, the explanation comes in a meeting, but it was as if Lincoln was reading a paragraph from the book).  I had read William Safire's Emancipation long ago, and while it was a wonderful read, it stopped at the Declaration. This film gives some idea of the sheer difficulty of eradicating the conditions which rendered slavery normal.The other good bit is Daniel Day Lewis' acting.  He brought Lincoln to life as a gangly, astute, manipulative, wise-cracking, tortured man.  I think Day Lewis is overpraised, and I thought his last two roles in `There will be Blood' and `Gangs of New York' were outrageously over the top, but this was good.  A lot has been made of his accent, which I think is decent - but I did think it slipped back into Anglo-Irish when he raised his voice to Mrs. Lincoln.So overall though  I thought it was undramatic, and overly respectful.  I couldn't figure whether the story was asking us to  focus  on  Lincoln or Congress or Slavery.  Lincoln is given great wedges of text, but very little cut and thrust, he tells a few tales, but we know however close the vote, he will succeed.  The Congress debates are failures in two ways - the anti-Amendment side is not treated with any understanding - this may be a signal of the USAs ability to change completely, rendering the anti-Amendment arguments incomprehensible to today's generation - but as a result the opponents are portrayed as Caricatures, we get no feeling for the vehemence of their opposition. Also the debates are highly stylized, I presume the language is authentic to the times, but comes across as arch and false, the multitude of characters themselves - some manipulative, some fearful, some corrupt , all with huge amounts of facial hair, add to the strangeness.One of the characters says that if this amendment passes, whatever would come next  - voting for Blacks?  And the congress gasps,  Intermarriage?  More gasps, votes for women ? Outrage.  Ok , so we think they are dinosaurs, and this scene is sort-of played for laughs,  but I think the film would be more honest it could portray their fears more clearly.  Even Tommy Lee Jones, who has a goodish movies, goes home and hops into bed with his black servant, who, we presume, would be his wife if such a marriage were allowed, but we know the actress as the tough police lieutenant from Law and Order, so even this seemed (to me) to fall flat.And then, there is the Spielberg emotional manipulation -  we all know that when Lincoln is leaving for Ford's theatre, that its his final journey.  The scene shows Lincoln walking away  framed against a starry night sky seen through an arched window.  I looked to me like Spielberg was trying to say `See his going towards History now!', but it conjured up for me a scene from ET.  We also see Lincoln's Butler well with tears as Lincoln leaves - but as far as the Butler knows, he's just off for a night out.  Oh dear.So overall I think the movie fails for not knowing what its purpose is, we are not convinced about the depth of the arguments on each side, about how precarious the vote was, and because I think the makers are too concerned to be respectful to the past and  faithful to the facts without showing us the life and death drama of the times..",2,"Dull, more a waxwork exhibit than a movie",1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,3672,"['saw', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'same', 'week', 'saw', 'film', 'cases', 'had', 'good', 'idea', 'plot', 'beforehand', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'movie', 'was', 'gripping', 'dramatic', 'whereas', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'leaden.But', 'first', 'good', 'bits', 'definitely', 'made', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'Team', 'Rivals', 'details', 'why', 'Lincoln', 'needed', 'Amendment', 'had', 'declared', 'Emancipation', 'are', 'well', 'explained', 'not', 'really', 'Dialogue', 'explanation', 'meeting', 'was', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'reading', 'paragraph', 'book', 'had', 'read', 'William', 'Safire', 'Emancipation', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'wonderful', 'read', 'stopped', 'Declaration', 'film', 'idea', 'sheer', 'difficulty', 'eradicating', 'conditions', 'rendered', 'slavery', 'other', 'good', 'bit', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'acting', 'brought', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'gangly', 'astute', 'manipulative', 'wise-cracking', 'tortured', 'man', 'think', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'overpraised', 'thought', 'last', 'two', 'roles', 'will', 'be', 'Blood', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'were', 'outrageously', 'top', 'was', 'good', 'lot', 'been', 'made', 'accent', 'think', 'decent', 'did', 'think', 'slipped', 'back', 'Anglo-Irish', 'when', 'raised', 'voice', 'Mrs.', 'Lincoln.So', 'overall', 'thought', 'was', 'undramatic', 'overly', 'respectful', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'story', 'was', 'asking', 'focus', 'Lincoln', 'Congress', 'Slavery', 'Lincoln', 'given', 'great', 'wedges', 'text', 'very', 'little', 'cut', 'thrust', 'few', 'tales', 'know', 'however', 'close', 'vote', 'will', 'succeed', 'Congress', 'debates', 'are', 'failures', 'two', 'ways', 'anti-Amendment', 'side', 'not', 'treated', 'understanding', 'may', 'be', 'signal', 'USAs', 'ability', 'change', 'completely', 'rendering', 'anti-Amendment', 'arguments', 'incomprehensible', 'today', 'generation', 'result', 'opponents', 'are', 'portrayed', 'Caricatures', 'get', 'feeling', 'vehemence', 'opposition', 'Also', 'debates', 'are', 'highly', 'stylized', 'presume', 'language', 'authentic', 'times', 'across', 'arch', 'false', 'multitude', 'characters', 'manipulative', 'fearful', 'corrupt', 'huge', 'amounts', 'facial', 'hair', 'add', 'strangeness.One', 'characters', 'amendment', 'would', 'come', 'next', 'voting', 'Blacks', 'congress', 'gasps', 'Intermarriage', 'More', 'gasps', 'votes', 'women', 'Outrage', 'Ok', 'think', 'are', 'dinosaurs', 'scene', 'sort-of', 'played', 'laughs', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'honest', 'could', 'portray', 'fears', 'more', 'clearly', 'Even', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'goodish', 'movies', 'home', 'bed', 'black', 'servant', 'who', 'presume', 'would', 'be', 'wife', 'such', 'marriage', 'were', 'allowed', 'know', 'actress', 'tough', 'police', 'lieutenant', 'Law', 'Order', 'so', 'even', 'seemed', 'fall', 'flat.And', 'then', 'Spielberg', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'know', 'when', 'Lincoln', 'leaving', 'Ford', 'theatre', 'final', 'journey', 'scene', 'Lincoln', 'walking', 'away', 'framed', 'starry', 'night', 'sky', 'seen', 'arched', 'window', 'looked', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'See', 'going', 'towards', 'History', 'now', 'conjured', 'up', 'scene', 'ET', 'also', 'see', 'Lincoln', 'Butler', 'well', 'tears', 'Lincoln', 'as', 'far', 'Butler', 'knows', 'just', 'off', 'night', 'out', 'Oh', 'overall', 'think', 'movie', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'purpose', 'are', 'not', 'convinced', 'depth', 'arguments', 'side', 'how', 'precarious', 'vote', 'was', 'think', 'makers', 'are', 'too', 'concerned', 'be', 'respectful', 'past', 'faithful', 'facts', 'showing', 'life', 'death', 'drama', 'times..']",N/A
1592951,A167K0YA96FD56,B009AMANBA,Ian Gordon Malcomson,"[0, 1]","While I have never been a fan of great people in history movies, Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" wins my respect for how it takes a larger-than-life person like America's 16th president and builds an accurate narrative around him during a very defining time in the country's history. Spielberg artfully combines the character of a national leader with a complex chain of interconnecting events whirling around him to produce an authentic sense of very special times. Back in the early 1860s America was at war with itself and Lincoln, the Republican president, wanted to keep the concept of the union alive in the national consciousness. While supportive of the idea of the emancipating slaves, his main task was to find a way to win the war while avoiding a compromise with the Confederacy. As the film illustrates, Lincoln ever the cautious pragmatist and opportunist, looked for that key moment when the tide of war was turning in favour of the Union to deliver on emancipation, but since that was on a wartime proclamation, much more had to be done in Congress to make it a constitutional reality. It is early 1865 when this version of history really gets going. Both the North and South are war weary and some members of the Republican and Democrats are talking about negotiating a peace. If this move ever went through, Lincoln's presidency could likely have failed to achieve the saving of the nation and the six hundred thousand soldiers lost in the conflict would have died in vain. It is at this critical juncture that the Lincoln White House got the Republicans in Congress to sponsor an amendment to federally make it unlawful to keep slaves anywhere in the country. While I always knew that Lincoln was an inveterate teller of yarns, I never appreciate how effective it was as tactic to getting people onside until I watch this movie. The enduring wisdom and patience of this iconic man, in the midst of great adversity, within and outside his family, is definitely a strong point in this production. While I have been used to appreciating the fullness of Lincoln over five decades of political maturation, this film emphasizes the importance of seeing him at important moment when all could have been truly lost if he given in to less resolute minds. The supporting cast does a credible job in bringing out those noble traits in the man as he humbly tried to make sense of his destiny without getting too far ahead of the events at hand.",5,The Measure of the Man Inside the Essence of Time,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,2441,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'great', 'people', 'history', 'movies', 'Spielberg', 'Lincoln', 'respect', 'how', 'larger-than-life', 'person', 'America', '16th', 'president', 'accurate', 'narrative', 'very', 'defining', 'time', 'country', 'history', 'Spielberg', 'artfully', 'character', 'national', 'leader', 'complex', 'chain', 'interconnecting', 'events', 'whirling', 'around', 'produce', 'authentic', 'sense', 'very', 'special', 'times', 'Back', 'early', '1860s', 'America', 'was', 'war', 'Lincoln', 'Republican', 'president', 'wanted', 'keep', 'concept', 'union', 'alive', 'national', 'consciousness', 'supportive', 'idea', 'emancipating', 'slaves', 'main', 'task', 'was', 'find', 'way', 'win', 'war', 'avoiding', 'compromise', 'Confederacy', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'ever', 'cautious', 'pragmatist', 'opportunist', 'looked', 'key', 'moment', 'when', 'tide', 'war', 'was', 'turning', 'favour', 'Union', 'deliver', 'emancipation', 'was', 'wartime', 'proclamation', 'much', 'more', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'Congress', 'make', 'constitutional', 'reality', 'early', '1865', 'when', 'version', 'history', 'really', 'going', 'North', 'South', 'are', 'war', 'weary', 'members', 'Republican', 'Democrats', 'are', 'talking', 'negotiating', 'peace', 'move', 'ever', 'went', 'Lincoln', 'presidency', 'could', 'likely', 'have', 'failed', 'achieve', 'saving', 'nation', 'six', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'soldiers', 'lost', 'conflict', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'vain', 'critical', 'juncture', 'Lincoln', 'White', 'House', 'got', 'Republicans', 'Congress', 'sponsor', 'amendment', 'federally', 'make', 'unlawful', 'keep', 'slaves', 'anywhere', 'country', 'always', 'knew', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'inveterate', 'teller', 'yarns', 'never', 'appreciate', 'how', 'effective', 'was', 'as', 'tactic', 'getting', 'people', 'watch', 'movie', 'enduring', 'wisdom', 'patience', 'iconic', 'man', 'midst', 'great', 'adversity', 'family', 'definitely', 'strong', 'point', 'production', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'appreciating', 'fullness', 'Lincoln', 'five', 'decades', 'political', 'maturation', 'film', 'importance', 'seeing', 'important', 'moment', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'lost', 'given', 'less', 'resolute', 'minds', 'supporting', 'cast', 'credible', 'job', 'bringing', 'out', 'noble', 'traits', 'man', 'humbly', 'tried', 'make', 'sense', 'destiny', 'getting', 'too', 'far', 'ahead', 'events', 'hand']",N/A

However, to anyone that knows better, it is socialist propaganda, through and through. How many times does one have to hear ""EQUALITY"" over and over again before they understand what the people behind this movie are trying to promote. Let's be realistic, there was more to the Civil War than this nonsense. From what I have heard, there are quite a lot of myths going around about Lincoln's beliefs, why the war was really fought, among other things. And I'm inclined to believe much of it, because I understand human nature.There are numerous problems with lower-income African-Americans in our nation today. I have witnessed them firsthand. It annoys me to no end to see black people portrayed as complete victims and deified on film. That just is not true. Some of the most racist people that I've ever met were black, but I will not go into it. I will not state my exact heritage, but I look Arabic or East Indian, but I'm mixed, and am part black. I was born and lived in another country that had a sizable black population. I've worked with many American blacks in the past, and their attitude leaves much to be desired. I understand why there is so much racism against them in America. So it enrages me to see liberal advocates, politicians and Hollywood directors, writers and actors portray African-Americans as perpetual victims, portrayed as angels. This is not an accurate depiction. An accurate depiction would display their abhorrence for education, family values and safe, properly run communities, organizations and businesses. Now, bear with me, I am not talking about all of them, but quite a few. Quite a few. It's a cultural problem. White people have nothing to do with it, and believe me, I would not hesitate to address this if it applied.That was one thing that bothered me, but since the rest of the film was simply atrociously written and edited, I could not finish it. It's just bad movie-making. Spielberg is an action movie director. That is what he is best at. When he does movies like Amistad or Lincoln, his weaknesses as a film maker are massively exposed. Despite the fact that masses of sycophants and film snobs will pretend to like these movies at the beginning, they will not stand the test of time and will soon be forgotten. Lincoln was torture to watch, and I could not imagine any school teacher showing this to their kids, because it is an ultra-boring political procedural and not even a decent movie about Lincoln's life.

1592962,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B009AMANBA,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[4, 9]","Is That a saga or is it history ? We can ask the question and wonder. The inspiration from Walt Whitman is quite obvious and strong, showing Lincoln as the father of the nation able to filibuster like any other senator or representative, sacrificing his own life, his own wife, his own sons to the only objective he had in mind: to save the union by defeating the secessionists, which he did.But the film centers on the crucial period after Gettysburg and the famous address, after the ""government of the people, by the people, for the people"" till his death and his funeral. Those crucial two years of his presidency and of his legacy. To finish the war he had to cast in iron the freeing of the black slaves and that could only be performed with a constitutional amendment to the constitution, the thirteenth to be more clear, and then the rest and the next two amendments are what will come after him. This battle is essential and Spielberg plays with the situation with obvious pleasure. Votes of representatives or bought up, not with money but with administrative jobs. The promise of defeat to some Democrats in the North is also vastly used when necessary.In that debate in the House of Representatives in January 1865 some declarations by the slavery-leaning conservatives are funny in retrospect: menacing the House with the Black vote, with Black Representatives and Senators, and after that where will they stop? The menace of the vote of women and all other catastrophes that could happen if the Black slaves were finally freed by the Constitution. And the vote was won with a simple argument: ""I am not for the equality of all things, but only for the equal rights of everyone in front of the law."" A typical compromise on the side of the anti-slavery camp. The US Constitution cannot declare everyone equal in real terms but only in rights. Yet it will take one more amendment for that principle to become true, the fourteenth amendment that is at the core of the debate on same-sex marriage right now, the Supreme Court's decision pending on the subject.This is so true indeed that what is important is not the real equality of people in material terms but their equality in rights. Then the equality in real material terms has to be built, constructed, won step by step, one step at a time. That's the American way. They do not look after every single individual case, but they state in general terms rights for everyone and then everyone is supposed to conquer the implementation of these rights. Real equality for the Black slaves was won only one century later, in 1964-65 with the laws on equal rights and the vote, one century after the full freeing of the slaves. A long, very long time and delay, but that's what it took for the slaves and then their descendants to get beyond the Post Traumatic Slavery Disorder (or Syndrome), for them to re-conquer their soul, rebuild their mind, reconstruct their self-pride and their future. And it took them more than forty more years to reach the top, and yet the President is not a descendant of slaves. The trip to equality is not complete yet, but it will be some time soon now.The film insists on a picture of Abraham Lincoln as a fast aging man surrounded by personal tragedies, like the loss of a first son to the war, and then the enlistment of his second son against his mother's wish and his father's advice, and then the crazy emotional state of his wife who is constantly oscillating between headaches and breakdown, with some moments of sane political vision. She was instrumental in Lincoln's life and decisions, but not as a direct inspirer, rather as an obstacle to negotiate, and that obstacle when negotiated opened doors to the next step or steps on the road to eternal gratitude of the Black people, by the White people and for the Black and the White people. Lincoln turned Gettysburg from a deadly defeat to a shining victory, and of the whole humanity as for that. We still owe him a bundle.The last element to say is of course about the marvelous performance of the actor. It is a challenge for any actor to impersonate a historical character of this magnitude. Daniel Day Lewis is one of the greater American actors in the line of the greatest like Dustin Hoffman or Jack Nicholson in the previous generation. It is so difficult to embody both the crumbling physical shape of the man and his building up resolve and stamina on the essential question that will make history, unluckily after his death. A brilliant performance.Think when you see the film of what the Lincoln Monument has become in Washington D.C. and you might understand the depth of this history in the making that is only coming true today nearly 150 years after the end of the Civil War. I will regret though the fact that Grant's and Sherman's sweeping fire trail down into the Deep South in 1864 and 65 is only alluded to and not shown. The horror of the war is rather discreetly evoked with one or two strong pictures here and there but very little altogether.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,No better historical reconstruction

While many of us may have considered the Emancipation Proclamation (published after the Union victory at Antietam in September 1862 and effective on January 1, 1863) to be the event that ""freed the slaves"" and for which Abraham Lincoln has been considered our greatest president, the actual outlawing of Slavery throughout the United States did not come until the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was passed in both houses of Congress and formally ratified by the States at the end of 1865.  The legal necessity for this Amendment is carefully and clearly explained during this movie and gives gravity to this immensely important legislative activity.This is not a sweeping biographical study of Lincoln nor even the depiction of his entire presidency as was the dramatization of Gore Vidal's LINCOLN (1988) so ably performed by Sam Waterson and Mary Tyler Moore.  It is, rather, an intense focus on one set of events near the end of Lincoln's life and presidency that captures with greater clarity and precision the essential greatness of the man and enormous implications of the political debates facing the Congress at the time.Daniel Day Lewis gives what is certainly the single best interpretation of Lincoln I have ever seen, but the supporting cast is also extremely effective.  Tommy Lee Jones (as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens), Bruce McGill (as the irritable and blustery Secretary of War Stanton) and Sally Field (the acute, but deeply disturbed Mary Todd Lincoln), all render memorable performances.  The human toll of war are also presented without resorting to such faux battle re-enactments as were presented in the 1988 TV movie.

He disappears into every role he's ever done. He's a true chameleon and he deserves every accolade that could ever be heaped on him. His work in this film, Steven Spielberg's LINCOLN, absolutely 1000% deserved the Golden Globe and the Oscar as well as any number of other awards he won. And this is a film about who is largely considered the greatest president in American history, written by one of America's premier playwrights and directed by one of the greatest directors to have ever lived.So, why did this film leave me wanting?LINCOLN is not an epic portrayal of Abraham Lincoln's life, from humble beginnings to great heights and tragic assassination; as written by Tony Kushner, it is laser-focused on Lincoln, his wife Mary (the incomparable Sally Field), his chief of staff William Seward (the always great David Strathairn) and his motley crew of assistants (played by the marvelous trio of James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson), and radical Republican abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens (the eternally gruff Tommy Lee Jones) and the months leading to the vote in the House of Representatives for the Thirteenth Amendment, essentially abolishing slavery for all time in the United States. This amendment, for Lincoln, serves two purposes: The end of slavery and the end of the long and bloody Civil War. But complications arise when The Confederacy sends envoys to Washington for peace talks. Lincoln wants the war to end, but he can't, in good conscience, allow the war to end and for slavery to continue. He also can't, in good conscience, allow the war to go on, with hundreds of thousands of Americans dying. Through what some might consider ""impeachable"" offenses, Lincoln secures the necessary votes to have the amendment pass, but his victory is short-lived for the man himself, since not much longer after the amendment's passage, he would meet his end by a coward's bullet.The first sequence of the film shows a brutal battle sequence followed by Lincoln visiting a Union Army camp and being confronted by a black soldier who understands that while he has been proclaimed to be equal by the leader of this country, he is not even equal while he and his brothers fight and die for this cause. It frames the film succinctly and beautifully in such a short period of time, and I wished that there were more moments like that throughout the film. The film is peppered with Lincoln telling anecdotes to just about anyone who will listen (there's a great moment where a Union Army general actually leaves the room, refusing to listen to any more of Lincoln's stories), and they're indicitive of the gentle, wise, and soft-spoken man who did everything he could to bring equality to all men. Every scene with Lewis is magnetic. You can't take your eyes off him, and what's more indicitive of how brilliant of a performance it is, you never get the sense that this is Daniel Day-Lewis ""pretending"" to be Lincoln; he simply IS Lincoln. Spielberg speaks again to his perfect casting instincts with Field as the barely-restrained Mary Todd Lincoln and Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, who has deeply personal feelings about and furious contempt for slavery, and as a man who's mind will not be changed, Jones is the perfect actor to play that. And the film is almost over-populated with great actors, like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Lee Pace, Hal Holbrook, Bruce McGill, Walton Goggins, Jared Harris, and Joseph Cross, but many of these other actors seem to be making not much more than cameos.The only problem with the film, really, is with how much it feels like a stage play. Kushner is a brilliant writer, and if this were just about any other quality director, this would feel a bit more complete as a film because of its theatrical monologues and intimate scenes. It feels very much like Spielberg's AMISTAD, which, while powerful, also lacks the epic scope of the films the name Spielberg evokes. Ironically, Spielberg's last film, the excellent WAR HORSE, was actually based on a stage play, but had a more sweeping and epic quality to it, making it a more ""Spielbergian"" Spielberg film, and therefore, a more fulfilling cinematic experience. Aside from a few sequences in this film, such as the opening sequence, there's very little to make this feel like it's not much more than a stage play.The film is absolutely worth watching for a number of different reasons, mainly for the performance/disappearance of Lewis, but LINCOLN ends on such a note that it felt like it wasn't necessary to take it that far, and while you have time to reflect and recognize the greatness not only of the man the film is about, but also of the craftsmanship of the people involved, you also will find yourself glad you saw it, but not much else.4 out of

1592993,A140XH16IKR4B0,B009AMANBA,Jean E. Pouliot,"[8, 11]","""Lincoln"" is a marvelous portrait of our 16th president and his times, splitting the difference between hagiography and straight history. Spielberg has grafted the savvy conniving politician of Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals"" with the otherworldly, solomonic martyr of post-Civil War history. The film focuses on the events of January 1865. The Civil War, all but won by the Union, is drawing its final labored death gasps. Lincoln is torn between an offer by Confederate representatives that might end the war (though short of an abolition of slavery) and the possibility of passing a constitutional amendment (with a Congress full of Union supporters) ending the practice. The film deals with the backroom dealing (including practices that were second cousins to flat-out bribery) that pressured lame duck congressmen to either support the amendment or to abstain from voting.Those who have read ""Team of Rivals"" won't be surprised by the portrayal of Lincoln as a complex man and a savvy politician. He brings the DC telegraph office to a standstill with a still-funny bawdy story about a portrait of Washington in a British privy. He and wife Mary get into a fight about Mary's worry about son Robert joining the army. Lincoln opines on his presidential powers to a rapt cabinet in one scene, then in another, bellows at them to get into line behind his leadership.Daniel Day-Lewis is masterful is Lincoln, inhabiting his character to the point that you forget you are watching an actorly portrayal. But the biggest surprise was watching Sally Field (!) bring a lively (if questionable) portrait of Mary Todd Lincoln to the screen. Fields' Mary is tough, with a sharp tongue for politicians too eager to investigate her expenses than providing her with a livable White House. Her ""madness"" is explained away as a consequence of grief over son Tad's death in Lincoln's first term. Your mileage may vary, however, as did Robert's in later years, when he confined Mary to an asylum.Spielberg did a nice job bringing the look and feel of 1860s Washington to the screen. The Capitol dome was painted blue, the streets were unpaved (if unpoopy) and the president ferried around the city in an unroofed carriage. Tad Lincoln had the run of the White House and Robert Lincoln WAS at Appomattox for the surrender of General Lee's forces. The loving fatherly scenes of Abe and 12-year-old Tad were touching and beautiful. Some critics might wonder whether Abe was really as saintly as Spielberg made him out to be. In some scenes, a halo is all but visible, and the adulation of those around him borders on the mawkish. A scene in which ordinary soldiers recited the Gettysburg Address was moving, yet discordant in its unlikeliness. Certainly, there were more than a few - Democrats and Southern sympathizers - who considered him a figure of satire and cruel vilification. And while Spielberg put drama into the passage of the anti-slavery 13th amendment, the celebratory scenes at its passage seemed doubtful. But all in all, ""Lincoln"" brought a measure of complexity to one of the most pivotal figures in American history.",5,"Superb, if a bit saintly",1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,3127,"['Lincoln', 'marvelous', 'portrait', '16th', 'president', 'times', 'splitting', 'difference', 'hagiography', 'straight', 'history', 'Spielberg', 'grafted', 'savvy', 'conniving', 'politician', 'Doris', 'Kearns', 'Goodwin', 'Team', 'Rivals', 'otherworldly', 'solomonic', 'martyr', 'post-Civil', 'War', 'history', 'film', 'events', 'January', '1865', 'Civil', 'War', 'won', 'Union', 'drawing', 'final', 'labored', 'death', 'gasps', 'Lincoln', 'torn', 'offer', 'Confederate', 'representatives', 'might', 'end', 'war', 'short', 'abolition', 'slavery', 'possibility', 'passing', 'constitutional', 'amendment', 'Congress', 'full', 'Union', 'supporters', 'ending', 'practice', 'film', 'deals', 'backroom', 'dealing', 'including', 'practices', 'were', 'second', 'cousins', 'flat-out', 'bribery', 'pressured', 'lame', 'duck', 'congressmen', 'support', 'amendment', 'abstain', 'voting.Those', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'Team', 'Rivals', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'portrayal', 'Lincoln', 'complex', 'man', 'savvy', 'politician', 'DC', 'telegraph', 'office', 'standstill', 'still-funny', 'bawdy', 'story', 'portrait', 'Washington', 'British', 'privy', 'wife', 'Mary', 'get', 'fight', 'Mary', 'worry', 'son', 'Robert', 'joining', 'army', 'Lincoln', 'presidential', 'powers', 'rapt', 'cabinet', 'one', 'scene', 'then', 'get', 'line', 'leadership.Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'masterful', 'Lincoln', 'inhabiting', 'character', 'point', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'actorly', 'portrayal', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'watching', 'Sally', 'Field', 'bring', 'lively', 'questionable', 'portrait', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'screen', 'Fields', 'Mary', 'tough', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'politicians', 'too', 'eager', 'investigate', 'expenses', 'providing', 'livable', 'White', 'House', 'madness', 'explained', 'away', 'consequence', 'grief', 'son', 'Tad', 'death', 'Lincoln', 'first', 'term', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'however', 'did', 'Robert', 'later', 'years', 'when', 'confined', 'Mary', 'asylum.Spielberg', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'bringing', 'look', 'feel', '1860s', 'Washington', 'screen', 'Capitol', 'dome', 'was', 'painted', 'blue', 'streets', 'were', 'unpaved', 'unpoopy', 'president', 'ferried', 'city', 'unroofed', 'carriage', 'Tad', 'Lincoln', 'had', 'run', 'White', 'House', 'Robert', 'Lincoln', 'WAS', 'Appomattox', 'surrender', 'General', 'Lee', 'forces', 'loving', 'fatherly', 'scenes', 'Abe', '12-year-old', 'Tad', 'were', 'touching', 'beautiful', 'critics', 'might', 'wonder', 'Abe', 'was', 'really', 'as', 'saintly', 'Spielberg', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'scenes', 'halo', 'visible', 'adulation', 'borders', 'mawkish', 'scene', 'ordinary', 'soldiers', 'recited', 'Gettysburg', 'Address', 'was', 'moving', 'yet', 'discordant', 'unlikeliness', 'Certainly', 'were', 'more', 'few', 'Democrats', 'Southern', 'sympathizers', 'who', 'considered', 'figure', 'satire', 'cruel', 'vilification', 'Spielberg', 'put', 'drama', 'passage', 'anti-slavery', '13th', 'amendment', 'celebratory', 'scenes', 'passage', 'seemed', 'doubtful', 'Lincoln', 'brought', 'measure', 'complexity', 'one', 'most', 'pivotal', 'figures', 'American', 'history']",N/A

1592998,A1VU02G794GYBN,B009AMANBA,JeffPorcaroFan,"[1, 2]","Let's all be honest.  The main reason this film achieved so much was because of Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones.  Lewis nailed President Lincoln, from his accent to his mannerisms to his love of storytelling and witticism.  Lewis BECAME Lincoln.  Sally Field also did an excellent job portraying the mentally complex Mary Todd.However, all of this fine acting, great casting and pretty good writing is confounded by the disjointed plot.  Frankly, if I were ever to watch this again, I'll take notes so I can remember who is who and when things are occurring.  It is very difficult to remember who each character is because there are far too many of them, and then to try and remember which side they were on politically is also an arduous task.  The sheer magnitude of the number of characters in this film is overwhelming and, I believe, takes a very great deal away from the film.Another grievance is the fact that they don't lay out a little time line so viewers can know when things are occurring in relation to Lincoln's inevitable assassination.  They don't say, ""February 21st, 1865"".  Again, this can be confusing because a great deal of time passes between major plot points.Finally, there is far too much going on at one time.  From trying to pass the amendment to winning over lame duck democrats, to the civil war, to Lincoln's domestic trouble...  It was simply far too much for anyone to take in because the viewer was being bombarded with different story lines.In any event, I would recommend this purely for Jones and Lewis' acting performances because that is what made this film so popular.

President Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) has been re-elected and is awaiting inauguration. Lincoln wishes to add the 13th amendment to the Constitution which would abolish slavery. It is Lincoln's hope to pass the amendment before the inauguration.  Acting on information from Secretary of State Seward (David Strathairn), Lincoln learns that he will need 20 Democratic votes to pass the amendment.  Lincoln and Seward target several lame-duck congressmen who will be out of office in the hopes of gaining their vote for the amendment.Meanwhile, Lincoln's wife Mary (Sally Field) is still mourning the death of son Willie.  To make matters even more difficult for her, her son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) wants to enlist in the army.  This is almost too much for Mary to handle.The action in Congress continues to boil as the vote draws near.  Plus, the bloody Civil War rages on.  A delegation has been sent from the Confederacy to Washington to meet with Lincoln to see if a peace settlement could be arranged.  But this delegation could threaten the congressional vote on the 13th amendment.I'm a big fan of American history, and I found ""Lincoln"" to be compelling and dramatic.  Spielberg has done a masterful job of assembling a fine cast of actors.  Daniel Day-Lewis was the perfect choice for Lincoln, and Sally Field does an equally impressive job as Mary Todd Lincoln.  Of course, I can't forget Tommy Lee Jones as the racial-equality congressman Thaddeus Stevens.  I thought the movie was historically accurate, and I'm glad Spielberg chose to focus on the last 4 months of Lincoln's time in office.

Fellowes ""Splendid Reviews""","[3, 7]","Maybe I have been spoiled by the superb work of HBO-with its superb rendering of David McCullough's JOHN ADAMS series, and maybe I watch too much PBS--but the silly opening of this film said it all. It was a prelude to the sheer sentimental pap that would follow. But it's my fault. I've been spoiled by excellent biopics and such and forgot that Spielberg did this silly mess. But I was still a bit surprised. After all, THE COLOR PURPLE is quite good, and SCHINDLER'S LIST is also noteworthy--but he does give us sugary sentiment served up on a platter here--one from the White House collection, to be sure.Again, the opening scene was all I needed to give me what I was going to be presented for another two hours. There's no way any black man in that time period would have had the temerity to walk up to any white man, much less, Lincoln, the President, and complain about white men making three dollars more than they. It was laughable. And cringe-able--these two black soldiers wax eloquent with Abe like he's Santa Claus and they just graduated from Harvard. Then we have two white soldiers, portraying the myth of the noble Yankees, of course, and their ridiculous discourse.Lincoln, and this is a fact, did not give one hoot about blacks. He was a white man of his time, and this was purepolitics of dismantling the lucrative South (and the fruits of slave labor therein) first and foremost.Any black person of this fair land will tell you that the Great Migration 60-70 years later was about finding manufacturing and better-paying work in the so-called Free North, foremost. There was no welcome mat for them, and certainly, circa 1860, no Yankee got up their firearms to defend them. It was about dismantling the lucrative agrarian south. The bit about defending slaves is pure whitewash (pun, unintended) myth.  And it's astounding, the denial in our collective consciousness applauding this hooey stuff about this very conflicted and complex President--who-- by the way, ordered the mass hanging of Native Americans for their rebellion against the White Man's unjust tactics in defending their United States. (This is a verifiable fact, so look it up, Spielberg).In conclusion: HBO, PBS--some plausible entity--now do the real story of Lincoln, please.",2,Serious lack of plausibility,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,2267,"['Maybe', 'have', 'been', 'spoiled', 'superb', 'work', 'HBO-with', 'superb', 'rendering', 'David', 'McCullough', 'JOHN', 'ADAMS', 'series', 'maybe', 'watch', 'too', 'much', 'PBS', 'silly', 'opening', 'film', 'said', 'was', 'prelude', 'sheer', 'sentimental', 'pap', 'would', 'follow', 'fault', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoiled', 'excellent', 'biopics', 'such', 'forgot', 'Spielberg', 'did', 'silly', 'mess', 'was', 'still', 'bit', 'surprised', 'THE', 'COLOR', 'PURPLE', 'quite', 'good', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'give', 'sugary', 'sentiment', 'served', 'up', 'platter', 'here', 'one', 'White', 'House', 'collection', 'be', 'sure.Again', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'needed', 'give', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'presented', 'two', 'hours', 'way', 'black', 'man', 'time', 'period', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'temerity', 'walk', 'up', 'white', 'man', 'much', 'less', 'Lincoln', 'President', 'complain', 'white', 'men', 'making', 'three', 'dollars', 'more', 'was', 'laughable', 'cringe-able', 'two', 'black', 'soldiers', 'wax', 'eloquent', 'Abe', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'just', 'graduated', 'Harvard', 'Then', 'have', 'two', 'white', 'soldiers', 'portraying', 'myth', 'noble', 'Yankees', 'course', 'ridiculous', 'discourse.Lincoln', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'one', 'hoot', 'blacks', 'was', 'white', 'man', 'time', 'was', 'purepolitics', 'dismantling', 'lucrative', 'South', 'fruits', 'slave', 'labor', 'therein', 'first', 'foremost.Any', 'black', 'person', 'fair', 'land', 'will', 'tell', 'Great', 'Migration', '60-70', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'finding', 'manufacturing', 'better-paying', 'work', 'so-called', 'Free', 'North', 'foremost', 'was', 'welcome', 'mat', 'certainly', 'circa', '1860', 'Yankee', 'got', 'up', 'firearms', 'defend', 'was', 'dismantling', 'lucrative', 'agrarian', 'south', 'bit', 'defending', 'slaves', 'pure', 'whitewash', 'pun', 'unintended', 'myth', 'astounding', 'denial', 'collective', 'consciousness', 'applauding', 'hooey', 'stuff', 'very', 'conflicted', 'complex', 'President', 'who', 'way', 'ordered', 'mass', 'hanging', 'Native', 'Americans', 'rebellion', 'White', 'Man', 'unjust', 'tactics', 'defending', 'United', 'States', 'verifiable', 'fact', 'look', 'up', 'Spielberg', 'conclusion', 'HBO', 'PBS', 'plausible', 'entity', 'now', 'do', 'real', 'story', 'Lincoln', 'please']",N/A

1593010,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B009AMANBA,Jiang Xueqin,"[4, 5]","As a Spielberg production, ""Lincoln"" is often a highly manipulative tearjerker, but it can at times also be an intelligent, thoughtful, and complex work.  The movie is supposed to be based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals,"" but I think the script owes more to Robert Caro's Lyndon Baines Johnson biography.  In ""Master of the Senate,"" Caro reveals Johnson as the master prevaricator and vote counter, knowing exactly how many votes he needed to pass the bill, which Senator was voting which position, and if and how the Senator's position could be switched.  Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" very much follows the same lines -- how Lincoln would ultimately pass the 13th amendment through manipulation, bribery, compromise, procrastination, and ultimately prevarication.It's the first week of Lincoln's second term, which he has won by an overwhelming majority, and he is determined to use his power and his popularity to pass the 13th amendment, which would strike the right to own slaves from the Constitution forever.  Lincoln feels urgency for two reasons.  First, the North is soon about to overwhelm the South, and if that were to happen whatever popular support for the 13th amendment would vanish with the winning of the war.  Second, Lincoln, as a lawyer, knows that his Emancipation Proclamation is filled with legal contradictions that a Supreme Court, no longer afraid of a wartime president, would strike down immediately.  To pass the 13th amendment, Lincoln must use all the immense power and popularity he has amassed for himself, and the entire movie offers a clinical study of how Lincoln would manipulate his wife, his most trusted subordinate (Secretary of State Seward), the different factions of his own Republican Party, and Democratic congressmen with a conscience to pass the 13th amendment.  That Spielberg could fill such a legislative triumph with high melodrama is a testament to his film-making prowess.Ultimately, what makes ""Lincoln"" so compelling to watch is Daniel Day-Lewis' precise portrayal.  Day-Lewis imbues his Lincoln persona with authority and compassion, but also grace and elegance, and it's simply a delight to watch Day-Lewis onscreen.",5,Well-Crafted,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,2179,"['Spielberg', 'production', 'Lincoln', 'often', 'highly', 'manipulative', 'tearjerker', 'can', 'times', 'also', 'be', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'complex', 'work', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'Doris', 'Kearns', 'Goodwin', 'Team', 'Rivals', 'think', 'script', 'more', 'Robert', 'Caro', 'Lyndon', 'Baines', 'Johnson', 'biography', 'Master', 'Senate', 'Caro', 'Johnson', 'master', 'prevaricator', 'vote', 'counter', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'how', 'many', 'votes', 'needed', 'pass', 'bill', 'Senator', 'was', 'voting', 'position', 'how', 'Senator', 'position', 'could', 'be', 'switched', 'Spielberg', 'Lincoln', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'lines', 'how', 'Lincoln', 'would', 'ultimately', 'pass', '13th', 'amendment', 'manipulation', 'bribery', 'compromise', 'procrastination', 'ultimately', 'prevarication.It', 'first', 'week', 'Lincoln', 'second', 'term', 'won', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'determined', 'use', 'power', 'popularity', 'pass', '13th', 'amendment', 'would', 'strike', 'right', 'own', 'slaves', 'Constitution', 'forever', 'Lincoln', 'feels', 'urgency', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'North', 'soon', 'overwhelm', 'South', 'were', 'happen', 'popular', 'support', '13th', 'amendment', 'would', 'vanish', 'winning', 'war', 'Second', 'Lincoln', 'lawyer', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'filled', 'legal', 'contradictions', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'no', 'longer', 'afraid', 'wartime', 'president', 'would', 'strike', 'down', 'immediately', 'pass', '13th', 'amendment', 'Lincoln', 'must', 'use', 'immense', 'power', 'popularity', 'amassed', 'entire', 'movie', 'clinical', 'study', 'how', 'Lincoln', 'would', 'manipulate', 'wife', 'most', 'trusted', 'subordinate', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Seward', 'different', 'factions', 'own', 'Republican', 'Party', 'Democratic', 'congressmen', 'conscience', 'pass', '13th', 'amendment', 'Spielberg', 'could', 'fill', 'legislative', 'triumph', 'high', 'melodrama', 'testament', 'film-making', 'prowess.Ultimately', 'what', 'Lincoln', 'so', 'compelling', 'watch', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'precise', 'portrayal', 'Day-Lewis', 'imbues', 'Lincoln', 'persona', 'authority', 'compassion', 'also', 'grace', 'elegance', 'simply', 'delight', 'watch', 'Day-Lewis', 'onscreen']",N/A

Part of that is in the film but in reality, very little. It is more about an insight into the politics in Washington during the presidency of Lincoln.

Two and a half ponderous, pretentious, stiflingly boring hours about a few weeks in the life of the most overrated president in history. If he hadn't been assassinated, he might be seen now as the wildly destructive crackpot-on-a-mission he really was - a 19th century George W Bush - instead of as the wise, easy-going, deeply compassionate but pragmatic martyr this silly movie makes him out to be.Because Lincoln refused to allow the southern states to secede, which they had the right to do under the constitution, nearly a million people were slaughtered and the economy was ruined. Although he won his war, the damage he caused the country still has not healed 150 years later. Anybody who believes that this is a united country has his head in the sand. The South is and always has been a separate society in every way and has NEVER fit with the North.Just look at a red-state/blue-state map! The United States is made up of two distinct nations: one from the southeast westward, then up to the Canadian border and a skip northwest to Alaska; the other in the northeast, the west coast and Hawaii. It's a natural, organic division that has been here as long as there have been European settlers, and no amount of brainwashing or sappy movie-making will EVER change it. This has NEVER been a united country; it will never BE a united country. It's like trying to force Ireland to stay in the United Kingdom: it doesn't work.We are TWO countries, not one. It was a bad marriage from the beginning. The South should have been allowed to leave peacefully 160 years ago, to effect an amicable divorce when amity was still possible. But Lincoln the zealot refused, and the mess he left is still tearing these unnaturally ""United"" States apart.Slavery obviously was a peripheral issue, because it's long gone but the problems remain. Left on its own, the South would have eliminated slavery eventually anyway, as has every other civilized nation on earth. All Lincoln did by ramming it down the South's throat was to destroy the country, enforcing a union that has never worked, from 1620 until now.Stupid movies like this just preach to the choir, reminding Lincoln-lovers why they love him so much and celebrating his stirring triumph over the bad old South, when a TRULY visionary leader would have let it go. The South might very well have WANTED to rejoin the union later, after it had learned for itself that slavery is unspeakably evil, but it never had that chance.Lincoln did his best to destroy the South, and although he won his war he failed to annihilate the enemy. So now we have the South using Lincoln's very own Republican Party to wreak their vengeance on the rest of the country.

1593025,A168VXSISJWQN9,B009AMANBA,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[13, 17]","This movie focusses on an aspect of Lincoln's career that doesn't usually get much attention. Lincoln is known for his oratory, his pithy quotes, his leadership in the Civil War and his progressive views on slavery and the role of government in society. There's a tendency to overlook the practical matter of getting political decisions supported in the House. This movie redresses that missing element.The film is surprisingly intimate, given the dramatic circumstances of the time in which it is set. It begins at the start of 1865 with the Civil War going badly for the South, but no immediate prospect of peace. Lincoln sees this as an opportunity to force through an amendment to the Constitution making slavery illegal. Most of the film deals with the political machinations, including not a little chicanery, needed to obtain the necessary 2/3rds majority required to pass a Constitutional amendment. We see Lincoln as master manipulator, knowing where and how to apply pressure to get what he wants. He must satisfy not only his own Republican party, but also a sufficient number of Democrats to back the motion and the back-room deals and the dichotomy between what is said in private and what is put out for public consumption is fascinating (and still very much a part of politics today). Incidentally, those not familiar with the period may be surprised to learn that in 1865 the Republicans were the party in favor of expanding the role of government and protecting human rights.Daniel Day-Lewis gives a wonderfully impressive performance as Lincoln. Although he maintains his calm and rarely raises his voice, he is a magnetic presence whenever he is onscreen and it is easy to believe that he is able to bend people to his will. My wife, an Illinois native, assures me that his accent is authentic to the Kentucky/Illinois region of the midwest and he looks very much as Lincoln is usually portrayed. The manner in which Day-Lewis is able to slip from genial homeliness to ruthless political leadership to concerned husband and worried father is amazing; acting of the highest quality which will surely receive an Oscar nomination. He is well-supported by a team of veteran actors, among whom Tommy Lee Jones, as the leader of the progressive faction in the Republican party, stands out. I find the sub-plot involving Mary Lincoln's reluctance to let their son go to war is a distraction rather than an essential part of the film, but it does allow the actors to show their range and it incorporates a human element into Lincoln's character to sit alongside his more driven political persona.The movie is limited in scope and if you are anticipating much about the military side of the Civil War you will be disappointed. Because of this lack of breadth this might not amount to an Oscar-winning film. Nevertheless, it's a fascinating look at 19th century politics and boasts a towering performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.

But Daniel Day-Lewis does it so well & captures Lincoln as I imagine him. Sally Fields does a fine job with an easier task. She plays Mary Todd Lincoln as she rapidly descends into madness.In this version Congressman & abolitionist, Thaddeus Stevens is key to the passage of the amendment. This difficult part is played by Tommy Lee Jones in what may be the best performance of his often uneven career. He must control his passion & snarkiness,  in what he says & doesn't say as leader of the radical Republicans. He must sway oppositional  Democrats to pass the amendment. Presently our president is a Democrat & the recalcitrant party is the majority Republican congress. See the parallels? In any case 147 years ago things worked out.

1593031,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B009AMANBA,John Kwok,"[4, 7]","Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" is destined to be remembered as one of our greatest cinematic tributes to an important figure in American history, President Abraham Lincoln, with Irish actor Daniel Day-Lewis' riveting portrayal of him as perhaps the finest ever depicted on either stage or screen. Acclaimed American playwright Tony Kushner has written a compelling screenplay which documents one of the most important months in Lincoln's presidency, January, 1865, noted for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution by the United States House of Representatives, banning forever, both slavery and involuntary servitude (except in prisons) throughout the United States and other territories under its jurisdiction. Based in part on American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"", Kushner introduces us to a Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) who is both a crafty, extremely astute, politician and a funny storyteller much like another famous Illinois resident, Lincoln's future successor as President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, but, unlike Reagan, one who is plagued by a mentally unstable wife, Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field), still traumatized by the tragic death of their son Willie early in Lincoln's Presidency, and a rebellious older son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who wishes to serve in the Union Army commanded by General Ulysses S. Grant (Jared Harris), instead of continuing with his undergraduate studies at Harvard University. Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln is one destined to be remembered as the finest ever given on stage or screen, giving us a man tortured by his own personal family demons, while remaining both steadfast and confident in his duty to uphold the Constitution of the United States by waging a bloody war against the rebellious Confederate South and in ending forever, the scourge of Afro-American slavery. Having admired Day-Lewis ever since I saw him in his celebrated cinematic debut as Christy Brown in ""My Left Foot"", I was still surprised that he could give viewers such a compellingly realistic, quite sympathetic, portrayal of Lincoln as the self-educated thinker conversant in American law and the mathematical philosophy of Euclid, and as the brilliant politician and statesman during the worst crisis in American history, the American Civil War; without question this is his greatest performance in an exceptional cinematic career noted already for distinguished work in films as diverse as ""A Room with A View"", ""In The Name of the Father"",  ""The Age of Innocence"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"", ""The Crucible"" (in which he portrayed John Proctor in the acclaimed cinematic adaptation of his father-in-law Arthur Miller's noted play), and ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and one which warrants an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Actor"".Daniel Day-Lewis' memorable portrayal of Abraham Lincoln isn't the only reason to see ""Lincoln"". ""Lincoln"" is replete with exceptional performances by David Strathairn (Secretary of State William Steward), Tommy Lee Jones (Representative Thaddeus Stevens) and Sally Fields (Mary Todd Lincoln), but there's excellent work too from the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Robert Todd Lincoln), Lee Pace (Representative Fernando Wood), Hal Holbrook (Preston Blair), Bruce McGill (Secretary of War Edwin Stanton) and from James Spader too, who steals virtually every scene he is in as political operative W. N. Bilbo, portraying him as a Civil War version of  Watergate scandal mastermind E. Howard Hunt, using dirty political tricks and bribery in persuading lame duck Democratic Representatives to vote in favor of the Thirteenth Amendment. ""Lincoln"" is memorable too for long-time Spielberg collaborator cinematographer Janusz Kaminiski's exceptional photography of Civil War battles and political intrigue within the White House and on the floor of the House of Representatives. Another long-time Spielberg collaborator, composer John Williams, has a compelling musical score that harkens back to those he composed for ""Schinder's List"" and ""Angela's Ashes"" in his excellent usage of both solo instruments (piano and violin) and an entire orchestra (the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the baton of its music director, Riccardo Muti), drawing upon musical influences as diverse as bluegrass and Aaron Copland. ""Lincoln"" is an excellent cinematic portrait of a man, President Abraham Lincoln, who must decide whether it is more important to end the Civil War by peaceful negotiations with a militarily exhausted, on the verge of defeat, Confederacy or to end forever, the scourge of Afro-American slavery; without question, it will be revered as one of the most important films pertaining to the American Civil War and for its portrayal of Lincoln.",5,An Exceptional Portrait of Lincoln,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,4847,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Lincoln', 'destined', 'be', 'remembered', 'one',

History has not told the truth of Lincoln's racial views. Licoln did not believe that blacks and whites could co-exist, in fact he had stated that when the war was over, he was going to see to it that all blacks would be returned to Africa. Licoln fought the war for industrial interest, not over slavery. Lincoln believed that slavery was a social issue, and not a political issue and wanted nothing to do with it. The only reason he did, was because the South was winning the war, and he needed an excuse to continue the war, and he chose slavery as ""his"" cause. In fact, Gen. Grant and Gen. Sherman had stated that if the war was going to be about slavery, that they would in fact leave the Union and fight for the South. Even Jefferson Davis did not believe in slavery. In fact, over 50,000 men of non-white descent fought for the South, including blacks, Cubans, Mexicans, Native Americans and Irish. But history is full of holes and lies in oder to be politically correct. All of what Lincoln, Grant, Sherman and other and their social views on slavery are in their own words and writings... Filmmakers just continue to subscribe to political correctness, and continue the lies of history.I'll admit, Lewis really does remind you of Lincoln, and may have done an excellent job, but it does not save this film from false history and continues to be re-visionist history in favor of Lincoln and the Union.",1,False History Again!,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,1597,"['When', 'political', 'correctness', 'run', 'amok', 'become', 'truth', 'then', 'whole', 'world', 'will', 'have', 'gone', 'insane', 'have', 'been', 'studant', 'history', '30', 'years', 'well', 'verse', 'Civil', 'War', 'History', 'not', 'told', 'truth', 'Lincoln', 'racial', 'views', 'Licoln', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'blacks', 'whites', 'could', 'co-exist', 'fact', 'had', 'stated', 'when', 'war', 'was', 'over', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'blacks', 'would', 'be', 'returned', 'Africa', 'Licoln', 'fought', 'war', 'industrial', 'interest', 'not', 'slavery', 'Lincoln', 'believed', 'slavery', 'was', 'social', 'issue', 'not', 'political', 'issue', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'only', 'reason', 'did', 'was', 'South', 'was', 'winning', 'war', 'needed', 'excuse', 'continue', 'war', 'chose', 'slavery', 'cause', 'fact', 'Gen.', 'Grant', 'Gen.', 'Sherman', 'had', 'stated', 'war', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'about', 'slavery', 'would', 'fact', 'leave', 'Union', 'fight', 'South', 'Even', 'Jefferson', 'Davis', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'slavery', 'fact', '50,000', 'men', 'non-white', 'descent', 'fought', 'South', 'including', 'blacks', 'Cubans', 'Mexicans', 'Native', 'Americans', 'Irish', 'history', 'full', 'holes', 'lies', 'oder', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'what', 'Lincoln', 'Grant', 'Sherman', 'other', 'social', 'views', 'slavery', 'are', 'own', 'words', 'writings', 'Filmmakers', 'just', 'continue', 'subscribe', 'political', 'correctness', 'continue', 'lies', 'history.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'Lewis', 'really', 'remind', 'Lincoln', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'not', 'save', 'film', 'false', 'history', 'be', 're-visionist', 'history', 'favor', 'Lincoln', 'Union']",N/A

1593036,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B009AMANBA,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[2, 4]","Historical movies, in general and even the most effective ones, are inevitably daunting and biased affairs.  No matter how objective a director thinks they are in presenting a historical figure, the period and themes they choose in depicting the figure often betray the director's subjective purposes and interests about him.  We can never learn ""the truth"" about anyone, especially historical figures we cannot witness first-hand.  Despite the lofty mountain of research he has inspired, this is true of Lincoln himself.  Spielberg certainly realized this and focused his saga on the final, fourth year of the Civil War, on the beginning of Lincoln's second term in office, and most specifically, upon efforts to ratify the 13th amendment, which basically abolished slavery and by extension all forms of servitude.  In reviewing ""Lincoln"", I will not relate all the specific characters, settings, and details; so many reviewers, Amazon and otherwise, have thoroughly seen to that (and more authoritatively than I ever could).  I wish to narrow my focus on what I see as one of ""Lincoln""'s most ironic and prominent themes - the ""ideal"" of noble selfishness.I believe that, at heart, we are all selfish, or if you prefer the euphemistic adjective, ""self-concerned"".  Even when we do things for and help others, our primary objective is ""what do we get out of it?"".  This is not to detract from charitable, magnanimous, and self-sacrificing deeds.  What I am saying is that, in my opinion, no one can achieve pure altruism, e.g. complete selflessness.  But, I think we can achieve the next highest ideal: noble selfishness, that benefits many others besides yourself.""Lincoln"" argues that successful politicians adeptly use noble selfishness to achieve their objectives.  Even in our current period where revisionist Lincoln scholars have striven to demythologize and ""humanize"" our 16th president, presenting that theme takes no small courage. Lincoln's efforts to compel a 2/3 majority of obstreperous, ""self-concerned"" Representatives (2/3 of the Senate had voted in favor) - many of them Democrats (not Lincoln's party, the Republicans, who ironically, to many, resemble today's Democrats) revealed traits that have negative connotations for many of us.For example, as the movie showed, Lincoln exhaustively chatted up, or had lackeys chat up, many 13th amendment dissenters, even to the point of quid pro quo.  Early in the movie, we see throngs of supplicants and job seekers waiting to see Lincoln to seek favors, patronage, and legal advice, in order to show that conciliatory, compromising, manipulating tone was part of Lincoln's character.  Although historically shown to abhor slavery, arguably Lincoln had another, perhaps paramount, purpose for passing the 13th amendment - to disenfranchise the South, weaken their fighting morale, and acclerate their surrender and the Civil War's end.  In the movie, some representatives claimed that a Southern delegation from the Confederacy's president Jefferson Davis wished to see Lincoln to discuss peace terms.  The claim seemed dubious but did threaten some representatives' resolve to pass the amendment.  In the movie, Lincoln hastily pens a letter and has it delivered to the House, stating that ""as far as I know"", no delegation was forthcoming, which some representatives denounced as a ""lawyerly dodge"".  Lincoln was even willing to use a type of ""eminent domain"" to thwart the South by seizing the slaves as ""property"" from the South, then employing the Emancipation Proclamation, enacted earlier, to set them free.  Lincoln even tries mathematical logic, stating that if two things are individually equal to a third, then they are equal to each other.  This, which incorporated with Thaddeus Steven's assertion in the House that even if all men were not really created equal in nature, they were equal under the law, attempted to circumvent those representatives that thought that African-Americans were fundamentally inferior.And so it goes.  The movie shows Lincoln employing every political, legal, and logical weapon to flatter, wheedle, coax, intimidate, persuade, and entice as many representatives as possible (especially the 20 House democrats necessary to achieve the 2/3 majority) to vote for the 13th amendment.  Again, some audiences may have been shocked by the seemingly base, hypocritical, self-contradictory, and unscrupulous tactics the 16th president used.  Basically, it's a concession to the old adage that ""the end justifies the means"".  In any case it worked, of course, the amendment is passed.  Tellingly, the deciding vote, by the House speaker, stemmed from his desire to ""make history"".Of course, ""Lincoln"" has its other virtues like Daniel-Day Lewis's spellbinding portrayal of the President, Tommy Lee-Jones tour-de-force as the savagely but amusingly brusque, candid, and insulting Thaddeus Stevens, and the re-creation of the oppressive, anxious Civil War zeitgeist.  But above all, I think, ""Lincoln"" will have relevant, enduring value because of its assertion that compromise, however superficially distasteful and beholden to the innate selfishness of others, is really the only way to get grand political accomplishments.  I hope Obama and congressional members see the movie and retain that message.",4,Lincoln's Noble Selfishness - A Template for Modern Politicians,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,5300,"['Historical',

However, while the acting is top notch - Tom Lee Jones in particular is fantastic - Spielberg's direction of Daniel Day Lewis' Lincoln results in a portrait of a president who is not a quiet and reflective man of iron resolve, but rather a shrinking and frail man of iron resolve. While it is understandable that Lincoln's presidency took a toll on his health, Lincoln's physical stature appears to be a liability in Spielberg's eyes. We don't know what Lincoln was like in real life, but I don't think he was the man Spielberg tries to convey. Spielberg misses on another account, that being his focus of the Lincoln presidency during ratification of the 13th Amendment; it is the decidedly safe route to go as far as Hollywood is concerned. Despite the importance and the legacy of the 13th Amendment, I wish the movie had taken a less myopic view and captured all of Lincoln's presidency, especially for a movie that is going to clock in a 2 and 1/2 hours.

Nothing but several hours of slightly archaic language about Lincoln's efforts to get together all of the votes that were needed to pass the 13th Amendment.Pure boredom...beginning to end.  My personal opinion is that it shouldn't have even been called Lincoln.  ""The 13th Amendment"" would have been a better title.  In a movie about Lincoln, I would have preferred to hear about his history.  Where was he born?  What were his parents like?  What was it like to be born in a log cabin?  Was he ever in the military?  What was he like as a lawyer?  What was his wife like when they were courting?  When and how did she go crazy?...etc.  What were the Lincoln/Douglas debates like?

1593049,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B009AMANBA,Joseph M. Reninger,"[0, 0]","Despite the title, this movie is not a bio-pic about American president Abraham Lincoln. Rather, it tells the story of his fight in late 1864 and early 1865 to pass the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that abolished slavery in the United States. The story is dramatically told with the typical Spielberg visual flair.Even though the film is not a bio-pic, it gives a fully-rounded character portrait of Lincoln. We see him as a father comforting his young son and trying to keep his older son out of combat. We see the turbulent relationship with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln (ably played by Sally Field). He deals with congressmen, soldiers (high and low ranked), government workers, and everyday people. Lincoln often uses his penchant for storytelling to make his points. He's decisive and forceful when he needs to be. He is politically adept, which often means skirting on the edges of (if not crossing over) what's moral to achieve his ends. Viewers see his lawyerly mind working all the different facets of legal issues, especially when he discusses (though really it is a monologue) the legality and the impact of the Emancipation Proclamation. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a great performance, capturing the voice and look and world-weariness and optimism of Lincoln. So perhaps the title is justified.The political and moral wrangling over the amendment is interesting. Many different factions in the House of Representatives need to be satisfied--hard-lining abolitionists and Southern sympathizers and middle-grounders. Lincoln's staff works with sympathetic congressmen to make sure they don't push so hard they make it impossible for others to join the cause. They hire some men to offer patronage to wavering congressmen to secure their votes. When patronage doesn't work, blackmail is also tried. Meanwhile, a delegation from the Confederate government is invited to negotiate peace (thus placating those hoping that a diplomatic solution has been tried before the amendment is passed) but Lincoln struggles with accepting their potential offer (which would kill momentum for the amendment but end the war) and his desire to pass the amendment (which would end the evil of slavery but kill the peace negotiations). The movie gives plenty of food for thought on the right way to handle such situations and the need for compromise and chicanery in politics.Check out more commentary on A Good Story Is Hard to Find podcast which is what inspired me to watch.",4,Good story of 13th Amendment and Portrait of Lincoln,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,2472,"['title', 'movie', 'not', 'bio-pic', 'American', 'president', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Rather', 'story', 'fight', 'late', '1864', 'early', '1865', 'pass', '13th', 'Amendment', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'abolished', 'slavery', 'United', 'States', 'story', 'dramatically', 'told', 'typical', 'Spielberg', 'visual', 'flair.Even', 'film', 'not', 'bio-pic', 'fully-rounded', 'character', 'portrait', 'Lincoln', 'see', 'father', 'comforting', 'young', 'son', 'trying', 'keep', 'older', 'son', 'combat', 'see', 'turbulent', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'ably', 'played', 'Sally', 'Field', 'congressmen', 'soldiers', 'high', 'low', 'ranked', 'government', 'workers', 'everyday', 'people', 'Lincoln', 'often', 'penchant', 'storytelling', 'make', 'points', 'decisive', 'forceful', 'when', 'be', 'politically', 'adept', 'often', 'skirting', 'edges', 'not', 'crossing', 'over', 'what', 'moral', 'achieve', 'ends', 'Viewers', 'see', 'lawyerly', 'mind', 'working', 'different', 'facets', 'legal', 'issues', 'especially', 'when', 'really', 'monologue', 'legality', 'impact', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'great', 'performance', 'capturing', 'voice', 'look', 'world-weariness', 'optimism', 'Lincoln', 'So', 'perhaps', 'title', 'justified.The', 'political', 'moral', 'wrangling', 'amendment', 'interesting', 'Many', 'different', 'factions', 'House', 'Representatives', 'need', 'be', 'satisfied', 'hard-lining', 'abolitionists', 'Southern', 'sympathizers', 'middle-grounders', 'Lincoln', 'staff', 'sympathetic', 'congressmen', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'push', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'impossible', 'others', 'join', 'cause', 'hire', 'men', 'offer', 'patronage', 'wavering', 'congressmen', 'secure', 'votes', 'When', 'patronage', ""n't"", 'work', 'blackmail', 'also', 'tried', 'Meanwhile', 'delegation', 'Confederate', 'government', 'invited', 'negotiate', 'peace', 'thus', 'placating', 'hoping', 'diplomatic', 'solution', 'been', 'tried', 'amendment', 'passed', 'Lincoln', 'accepting', 'potential', 'offer', 'would', 'kill', 'momentum', 'amendment', 'end', 'war', 'desire', 'pass', 'amendment', 'would', 'end', 'evil', 'slavery', 'kill', 'peace', 'negotiations', 'movie', 'plenty', 'food', 'thought', 'right', 'way', 'handle', 'such', 'situations', 'need', 'compromise', 'chicanery', 'politics.Check', 'more', 'commentary', 'A', 'Good', 'Story', 'Hard', 'Find', 'podcast', 'what', 'inspired', 'watch']",N/A

1593054,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B009AMANBA,J. Richardson,"[0, 2]","Given the fact that anyone who's attended school in the United States knows who Abraham Lincoln is, I'll exclude the summary portion of this review. Now I'm going to warn you in advance that I've never been particularly fond of history so I already knew going in that this wasn't going resonate with me like it did with other people. To be completely honest, I'm ok with that. History is one of those subjects that you either love or hate, there's no real in-between. With that said, from a cinematic standpoint this film does a lot of things well and that's what kept me watching the entire way through.I, like my mother who watched this with me, went into Lincoln expecting the film to cover his entire life or, at least, his entire presidency. Instead, Lincoln covers the last few months of our 16th President's life. So what the viewer sees is Lincoln attempting pass to the 13th amendment and end the Civil War. This, of course, would outlaw slavery in the United States. Because this was a big turning point for our country, and Lincoln's biggest accomplishment, it only seems fitting that this would be the main subject discussed in the film.Visually the film is beautiful. From the sets to the costumes you can tell that there was a lot of hard work put into recreating this time period. Daniel Day-Lweis' transformation into Lincoln is most notable. He doesn't look perfect, of course, but the costume designers really did a great job at creating a very strong resemblance to the real Abraham Lincoln. The script used for the film, while flawed, does its job of telling the story without sounding redundant in comparison to everything we've read in the classrooms. What keeps it from being perfect is the fact that we don't know who most of these people are. You know Lincoln and his family, but everyone else seems like just another face and the viewer doesn't really know what their job is or how they're relevant to the story.My biggest gripe with the film is that none of the performances really stood out. Everyone involved felt like they were acting just to act which made some sections of the film excruciatingly boring. For a film to be two and a half hours long the last thing you want is for scenes to feel boring. Day-Lewis gave a solid performance, but he didn't necessarily feel like he was Lincoln. Sally Field's performance as the First Lady was solid as well, but at times felt a little overdone. There's a pretty extensive list of people involved so I won't break them down one by one. I will, however, say that Tommy Lee Jones, in my opinion, gave the strongest performance out of the entire cast. His character Thaddeus Stevens is one filled with so many conflicting emotions that it becomes difficult to pinpoint what his motives are, but once you reach the end it becomes very clear and you can't stop yourself from going ""whoa"".Lastly, I found it odd that they didn't really do much to cover his assassination. I was expecting it to be a very dramatic part of the film, but it felt like they just brushed over it. All they did was have a character come into a scene and yell, ""The president was assassinated"". Considering that this was a major thing when it happened it felt wrong that they made it seem like a minor detail. I don't know, maybe I was just expecting too much.Overall Score: 7/10 - Look, for the history enthusiasts there's a lot of enjoyment to be found in Lincoln. Assuming that most, if not all, of the content in here is legit, they touched on a lot of things I was unaware of. I knew going in that I wasn't going to leave blown away and this probably isn't a movie I would watch again, but I can't deny that the end result is very well done. What would have made it better, for me, would have been a cast that showed a little more enthusiasm. That's not to say that anyone performed poorly, I just found majority of the performances to be pretty bland. With that said, I would have a hard time not recommending this to fans of history or fans of Abraham Lincoln because even though I'm not crazy about the subject I don't regret spending the time to watch this.",4,7/10 - It's ok,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,4112,"['Given', 'fact', 'anyone', 'who', 'attended', 'school', 'United', 'States', 'knows', 'who', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', ""'ll"", 'exclude', 'summary', 'portion', 'review', 'Now', ""'m"", 'going', 'warn', 'advance', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'particularly', 'fond', 'history', 'already', 'knew', 'going', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'resonate', 'did', 'other', 'people', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', ""'m"", 'ok', 'History', 'one', 'subjects', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'real', 'in-between', 'said', 'cinematic', 'standpoint', 'film', 'lot', 'things', 'well', 'what', 'kept', 'watching', 'entire', 'way', 'through.I', 'mother', 'who', 'watched', 'went', 'Lincoln', 'expecting', 'film', 'cover', 'entire', 'life', 'least', 'entire', 'presidency', 'Instead', 'Lincoln', 'last', 'few', 'months', '16th', 'President', 'life', 'what', 'viewer', 'Lincoln', 'attempting', 'pass', '13th', 'amendment', 'end', 'Civil', 'War', 'course', 'would', 'outlaw', 'slavery', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'big', 'turning', 'point', 'country', 'Lincoln', 'biggest', 'accomplishment', 'only', 'fitting', 'would', 'be', 'main', 'subject', 'discussed', 'film.Visually', 'film', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'costumes', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'put', 'recreating', 'time', 'period', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lweis', 'transformation', 'Lincoln', 'most', 'notable', ""n't"", 'look', 'perfect', 'course', 'costume', 'designers', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'very', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'real', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'script', 'used', 'film', 'flawed', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'sounding', 'redundant', 'comparison', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'classrooms', 'What', 'being', 'perfect', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'know', 'Lincoln', 'family', 'everyone', 'else', 'like', 'just', 'face', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'job', 'how', ""'re"", 'relevant', 'story.My', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'film', 'none', 'performances', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'felt', 'were', 'acting', 'just', 'act', 'made', 'sections', 'film', 'excruciatingly', 'boring', 'film', 'be', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'last', 'thing', 'want', 'scenes', 'feel', 'boring', 'Day-Lewis', 'gave', 'solid', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'feel', 'was', 'Lincoln', 'Sally', 'Field', 'performance', 'First', 'Lady', 'was', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'times', 'felt', 'little', 'overdone', 'pretty', 'extensive', 'list', 'people', 'involved', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'one', 'one', 'will', 'however', 'say', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'opinion', 'gave', 'strongest', 'performance', 'entire', 'cast', 'character', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'one', 'filled', 'so', 'many', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'difficult', 'pinpoint', 'what', 'motives', 'are', 'once', 'reach', 'end', 'very', 'clear', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'going', 'whoa', '.Lastly', 'found', 'odd', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'cover', 'assassination', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'very', 'dramatic', 'part', 'film', 'felt', 'just', 'brushed', 'did', 'was', 'have', 'character', 'come', 'scene', 'yell', 'president', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Considering', 'was', 'major', 'thing', 'when', 'happened', 'felt', 'wrong', 'made', 'seem', 'minor', 'detail', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'expecting', 'too', 'much.Overall', 'Score', '7/10', 'Look', 'history', 'lot', 'enjoyment', 'be', 'found', 'Lincoln', 'Assuming', 'most', 'not', 'content', 'here', 'legit', 'touched', 'lot', 'things', 'was', 'unaware', 'knew', 'going', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'leave', 'blown', 'away', 'probably', ""n't"", 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'end', 'result', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'showed', 'little', 'more', 'enthusiasm', 'not', 'say', 'anyone', 'performed', 'poorly', 'just', 'found', 'majority', 'performances', 'be', 'pretty', 'bland', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'not', 'recommending', 'fans', 'history', 'fans', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'crazy', 'subject', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'spending', 'time', 'watch']",N/A
1593055,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B009AMANBA,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[37, 45]","Lincoln isn't a perfect movie (what is?) but it is extremely impressive.  It only suffers in comparison to what a ""perfect"" movie about Lincoln would be.  In comparison to mere mortal movies, it gets 5 stars.  I can't believe that it would get any competition for a Best Picture Oscar from silly films like Django Unchained.  Argo was good, but not nearly as good as this one.  Lincoln will enthrall those who are interested in this dramatic, amazing time in US history.  Yet it's not a war movie, it's a look at Lincoln the Man and how he navigates his role as US President, masterfully.Daniel Day Lewis is wonderful as Lincoln.  For an Englishman to play Lincoln so masterfully, he deserves the Oscar for Best Actor.  The look and feel of the movie is amazing.  You believe that you're in a time machine and that you're really THERE, in Washington, in 1865.  The portrayal of Lincoln's political infighting with an entrenched and arrogant Congress to get the 13th Amendment passed, is intriguing and intelligent.  Day inspires as Lincoln throughout.  One really gets the feeling of a storm of swirling voices in a desperate time of war, crying to be heard and followed, while Lincoln is the Man of his time, calmly staying strong and resolute in the midst of this chaos and grinding out his policies.  If Lincoln hadn't show great Leadership and pushed the 13th Amendment at the time he did, who knows when the country would have gotten up the courage to abolish slavery again?The secondary performances are great, including Sally Fields as Mary Todd Lincoln, Tommy Lee Jones as the Abolitionist Congressman Stevens, James Spader as a shifty Republican operative, David Strathairn as Secretary of State Seward, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln.  Fields in particular played a very difficult role (of the suffering and neurotic Mary Todd) very well.  ALL the performances were so well played -- like I said -- you think that you're really there in 1865.Lincoln, the movie, doesn't pull punches.  I hope that the producers made sure that they researched their material well and stayed true to the facts, because it makes SUCH an impact.  Film-goers who always thought that the Democrats were for freeing the slaves will be surprised to find this truth out: Demos in those days were absolutely for slavery and it fell to the Republicans (split into two camps: the Abolitionists and the Conservatives) to push the 13th Amendment through.  The sentiments of the anti-13th-Amendment crowd in those days is also portrayed with shocking candor.  Racial fear and hatred is expressed openly in the movie.  It's hard to swallow at times: was this really the mood of the people, or was this played up by Spielberg artificially?  Let the viewer watch it and decide!  I'm personally going to read more first-person accounts of that time of history.I have a few ""small"" criticisms of the movie:  some of the scenes where citizens seem to me to be insolent in front of the President were hard to take.  (An opening scene with some soldiers talking to Lincoln in a very familiar and non-respectful way; a scene where Lincoln bursts in upon a lobbyist who exclaims, ""Well I'll be F****ed!"")  I would think that coming before the President would cause 99.9% to be utterly respectfull if not petrified!

I am an avid reader of the times of the Presidency of Lincoln.  Basically this is all about slavery and nothing else.  Very little about the war and the pain of the war.  Very little about Lincoln, only about the passing of the 13th Amendment. Another movie for black America, yet it is unusual that no one realizes that it was Republican that sacrificed for the freedom of slavery.  You can see the Democrats would dead set against the freedom of slaves.  But I guess the viewer will never get that message.Unfortunately the Democrats have done everything to destroy the Black family, if you know anything about history.  Many make comparison to Obama to be like Lincoln.  Yet Lincoln did everything in his power to keep the country together, and Obama does everything he came to bring it down.  Lincoln was a man of vision and strength and I guess the movie did show that, well a very small part of it.  Any commander fells pain for the loss of his men.  I can see in the movie the pain in Lincoln in the loss of so many people.  It is interesting how many a President without military experience have put so many men in harms way.  If Lincoln had any real previous military experience, he might have been able to see a good military commander and not put so many bad commanders in power that killed so many troops on both sides.  It took years for Lincoln to pick Grant, because he won so many battle.  Grant was a man of vision in battle.The only part of the movie that moved me was the ending where there was a re-creation of the ending of the surrender of Lee.Spielberg picked the wrong book, I have no idea the message he was conveying.

I figured it HAD to be good if it is that popular. WRONG!  Its a typical Spielberg, using his films to push an agenda.  Lincoln was not believable and the acting was so so.  It was a vehicle for ""messages"" starting with soldiers quoting the Gettysburg address.  Soldiers, dirty and tired, born in the 1850's, in the midst of a bloody war, memorizing a speech and repeating it with perfect recall, grammar and diction like college grads.  REALLY?  We watched about half and since I love history, truly wanted to enjoy it, but couldn't.  It dragged, it was boring, it was dark (both filming and the story).

Or should I hedge the bet and average it up? Or down? But Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" is unabashedly a five star movie!""Lincoln"" isn't a biography of the President, but covers the time from just after his reelection up to his assassination. It focuses on his efforts to get the 13th Amendment to the Constitution passed before the new Congress is seated and the all the wheedling, machinations, deals, and plain old politics that went into the passing of the Amendment. The dramatic vote on the Amendment, which may be the second most important roll call in American history (next to the roll call on the vote for the Declaration of Independence), may also be the second most tension filled roll call of cinematic America since the movie ""1776."" As the roll is called and the Congress votes, even though we know how the vote turns out, we're on pins and needles trying to figure out how each Congressmen will vote. Will they adhere to party lines, or will they crossover?Although ""Lincoln"" isn't a full blown biography (which are at best highlights of a life on film) we're able to get a sense of the man. Daniel Day-Lewis' Lincoln is a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and it weighs on him almost literally. Lincoln is also a man that loves his children, but has a contentious relationship with his oldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Lincoln's marriage to Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) also teeters from her being an astute political ally of Lincoln's to the edge of madness. Day-Lewis doesn't so much as turn in a performance or channel Lincoln, he seems to inhabit him, it was like looking into the eyes of Lincoln.""Lincoln"" also fleshes out the members of Congress that were important to the vote, and demonstrates the more things change the more they stay the same (they just had funkier facial hair then). That some of our `leaders' are truly that, leaders, while some have all the courage of the convictions of their party and not their own, and some are downright malleable. The ultimate lesson of ""Lincoln"" (and the Civil War) is that democracy and this country are what we make of it.The cast is a long and distinguished one, including David Straitharn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Tommy Lee-Jones, Hal Holbrook, Bruce McGill, Jackie Earle-Haley, and a whole list of instantly recognizable names some of which have carried movies on their own, and each turns in an excellent performance, which mostly makes the actor invisible and the character real as a human being as opposed to our history class understanding of them. ""Lincoln"" is Steven Speilberg's movie. It is like Picasso signing a painting. ""Lincoln"" is also a pure example of filmmaking. Speilberg blends all the arts and trades that make a movie into a seamless work of art.One of the marks of a great movie, book, or painting, is whether you want to see it again and again to see what nuances reveal themselves.

We climbed into the car, parked several; blocks away from the busy downtown San Francisco movie palace we were at, and avidly discussed the movie until night fell and the stars broke through the low lying clouds on a warm January night.  The main topic of conversation, how lucky for Abe Lincoln to have Adam Driver to turn to on those cold Washington nights when the war was keeping him up, not to mention the madness of Mary Todd.Adam Driver, who plays ""Adam"" on HBO's Girls, plays ""Samuel Beckwith"" the lead White House telegraph operator, in Spielberg's LINCOLN.  We wondered first of all why screenwriter Tony Kushner hadn't just called his character ""Adam"" too, as his other writers do.  Poor Adam must have had a disconnect when he realized he was going to have to answer to somebody else's name.  Thus when Lincoln brushes his hair fondly, mumbles, ""Good night, Sam,"" you can see it in Adam's eyes, he doesn't really know why Lincoln is calling him ""Sam,"" it's not registering, his beautiful eyes fill up with puzzlement, just like on Girls, when Hanna won't answer his calls.  One of our party denied it was Adam at all, citing the blond highlights in Sam's hair that glisten in the thousands of gas lamps and sexy candles that brighten up Lincoln's private telegraph office, complete with bed.  ""Adam isn't blonde,"" our friend argued.  ""Well, in the 19th century he was.  Samuel was blond,"" I countered, believing at the time that ""Samuel Beckwith"" was a real-life 19th century communicator, perhaps the inventor of the telegram?  Not knowing then, what I know now, that Kushner and Spielberg had made up the appealing character of Sam, to use him as a sort of yes man slash devoted friend, like Sam in The Lord of the Rings, willing to do anything to get his master out of a jam, like Frodo.  ""Substitute Lincoln for Frodo,"" I continued, ""Sam for Sam, and the war against slavery for the war against Mordor or whatever it was called, and it's working for me.""My wife happened to be in the ladies room during Adam's big scene, and we kept waiting for him to come in at the end, but alas no.

1593105,ABIVKBMSIPEDY,B009AMANBA,Kiyo M.,"[4, 12]","Totally overrated.So you have the name Spielberg attached to it, a beautiful production and cast and Oscar-winner Daniel Day-Lewis...HOWEVER, underneath all that, this is one BORING film.What do we go to to the movies for? Mostly entertainment. Spielberg and this film seems to totally forget that element.It's obvious the screenwriter is more of a playwright than knowing the smooth flow, dramatic transitioning, and pacing translating it on film. The film is just talking heads the entire film and seems better suited for a stage performance or TV series.In the making, they mentioned the first draft of the screenplay was over 500 pages (generally, one page is worth 1 minute of screen time); so, originally, it would have been over an 8 hour film. Spielberg had to cut it down a lot, and he decided the most important part of the book adaptation was the ""13th Amendment"" section.The title of the film ""Lincoln"" is very misleading. It really should have just been called ""13th Amendment"" but of course that would be a horrible marketing title. I mean, there's a few scenes where they tried to show the personal side of Lincoln and his family, like the relationship with Lincoln and his son (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) but it really doesn't go anywhere and feels totally incomplete.If one really had no idea or ever heard of who Lincoln was, they really wouldn't get much out of this film either.The whole film just focuses on trying to pass the ""13th Amendment"" with Lincoln hiring men to convince Democrats to switch their votes. It's extremely boring and frustrating to watch and listen. You might as well watch C-Span. The pacing of the film is really horrible and it drags the entire time from start to finish -- there really is no high point -- yet the ending feels completely rushed.This is by far the most boring film Spielberg has ever produced. Don't be fooled by high production visuals/set and performance.This may be enjoyed by history critics (whether they agree with its accuracy or not), but for people who are looking for a full pleasurable movie-going experience, this film is not it, especially if you don't care for politics.I also feel Denzel Washington was robbed for Best Actor inFlightfor the Oscars; his performance was much more powerful throughout the entire film than Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. Even a 6 year old can play as Lincoln on a school play...This film is nowhere near Schindler's List quality.

As time grew near for the movie to be released I heard through the great vine that this move was going to be the best of the year.  Finally it arrives and a  friend and I rush to the the head of the line to purchase our tickets and sadly were told its sold out.  What a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT to us both, so patiently  we waited another week and at last, we have our tickets in our hands and feel as though we won the Willy Wonka's Golden ticket to the candy factory just to walk away after seeing Lincoln disappointed.  ""Lincoln"" should have been called just what is was, ""The Passing of the 13th Amendment"".  I had high hopes and was under the impression Lincoln was going to be more about the his life, but instead in was a segment of his life as President during the passing of the 13th Amendment.  I found it a bit boring at times, it tended to drag on and on, I was grateful that my popcorn was keeping me awake through this portion of the movie. The script was filled with very long winded sentences where one wanted to almost jump in and say  ""Slow Down,""  ""Inhale"", ""Take a Breath"", the dialogue just bounced from one mouth to another mouth like a ping pong tournament. The dialogue was confusing, not people friendly.Halfway into the movie things start to pick up and my attention was revived.  Although the beginning of this movie was not a eye opener, there are many greats about it.  Daniel Day Lewis, OUTSTANDING performance as LINCOLN, Absolutely OUTSTANDING!  Sally Field portrayed Mary Todd Lincoln, another OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE.  Her performance was touching, sincere, and realistic.  She showed the  personality of Mary Todd as all as she was; a mother, a grieving mother, a wife to the President, a ""women"" who  truly loved her husband AND even possibly, a hoot as some thought she was.  I found the scene where she was telling off Thadddeus Stevens ( played by  Tommy Lee Jones) outstanding.  She told him  what she disliked about him, how the people felt about him, compared what he was lacking compared to her husband, yet she was very lady- like  still  leaving Thaddeus with a  splinter in his buns. James Spader's performance was a bit annoying, attempting to come across as being humorous, I found him to be a flop. Thumbs up for the customs, 5 star all around, except for the hideous  wig that  Tommy Lee Jones wore, why they couldn't do a better  on that is beyond me., it was actually humorous it was so bad.  I found the subtitles through out the movie  to be a plus, they confirmed the ""who"", ""where's"" and exactly ""when's"".

I've been a Civil War buff since age 9 and a Civil War living historian (now portraying the 72nd PA of the Union Army of the Potomac) since 1988.  I really appreciate Mr. Bruno's review.  The war WAS truly about slavery no matter what the ""politically correct"" crowd tries to talk everybody into.  I've heard a black fella say at work and documentation from especially black people in Hellywood like Bill Cosby that Lincoln was an idiot and other less dignifying comments but he (Lincoln) was the emancipator of the slaves.  He wasn't a god but an imperfect person like myself and everybody else that lived other than the God-man Jesus Christ.  Lincoln wanting the freed black men to colonize outside of the US was not from hatred for them and belittlement but understanding what would happen post-war that actually did, ie, the KKK and other acts of the kind.  He wasn't a ""dumb farmer"" like most liberals think that he was but one of the most intelligent men that ever lived equal to George Washington.  Lincoln gave his very life for the cause of emancipation of the slave.  From Booth's own diary notes that he (Booth) was a racist.  If you're NOT for Lincoln, that you must be for Booth.  Even most southerners mourned Lincoln's death knowing what the Reconstruction would be with him dead...which again DID happen.  There are so many unbiased books to buy or take out of the library on Lincoln and his positions politically but most people are too lazy to read but listen to garbage instead.

Yes, the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing, so much so that he is not only capable of avoiding a parodic representation of Lincoln but ultimately capturing the nuances of our 16th President at the same time in a creative fashion. If you thought that ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Munich"" were too concerned with carnage and not enough with character, you needn't have such a fear going in to see ""Lincoln."" I admit that the timing of the picture was a bit odd, but why not? The moral of the story is that Spielberg is working against his more sensational instincts and trying very hard to make a film that will not entertain so much as it will inspire memories and spark discussions. I applaud Spielberg for NOT trying too hard to keep the audience's attention; after all, how dumb would it have been to simply make another war movie filled with bloody violence? Haven't we seen enough of that already? No, ""Lincoln"" is the deeper film, with Spielberg in mature mode, handling the subtleties of characterization splendidly. ""Lincoln"" is a moderately subjective character portrait and some kind of masterpiece, giving the more sensitive viewers among us the opportunity to watch actors really act and listen to characters as they engage in dialogue rather than physical violence. Quite a good film indeed. And, for what it's worth, I think Lincoln himself would have had the good sense of humor to have approved of this picture (I realize I'm pulling the man and his times out of context, but still...).",5,This is a memorial from Spielberg to Lincoln...,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1614,"['may', 'ask', 'why', 'others', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'consider', 'personally', 'thought', 'picture', 'was', 'exciting', 'Yes', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'astonishing', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'only', 'capable', 'avoiding', 'parodic', 'representation', 'Lincoln', 'ultimately', 'capturing', 'nuances', '16th', 'President', 'same', 'time', 'creative', 'fashion', 'thought', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Munich', 'were', 'too', 'concerned', 'carnage', 'not', 'enough', 'character', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'fear', 'going', 'see', 'Lincoln', 'admit', 'timing', 'picture', 'was', 'bit', 'odd', 'why', 'not', 'moral', 'story', 'Spielberg', 'working', 'more', 'sensational', 'instincts', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'make', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'entertain', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'inspire', 'memories', 'spark', 'discussions', 'applaud', 'Spielberg', 'NOT', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'keep', 'audience', 'attention', 'how', 'dumb', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'simply', 'make', 'war', 'movie', 'filled', 'bloody', 'violence', 'Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'enough', 'already', 'No', 'Lincoln', 'deeper', 'film', 'Spielberg', 'mature', 'mode', 'handling', 'subtleties', 'characterization', 'splendidly', 'Lincoln', 'moderately', 'subjective', 'character', 'portrait', 'kind', 'masterpiece', 'giving', 'more', 'sensitive', 'viewers', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'actors', 'really', 'act', 'listen', 'characters', 'engage', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'physical', 'violence', 'good', 'film', 'indeed', 'what', 'worth', 'think', 'Lincoln', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'have', 'approved', 'picture', 'realize', ""'m"", 'pulling', 'man', 'times', 'context', 'still']",N/A

I am interesting in history and figured that because Stephen Spielburg was involved with this script and there was so much publicity for it that I was going to love it.  I sure was disappointed.From the beginning which started on a battlefield with Abraham Lincoln and two Union soldiers (one black and one white) making politically correct statements and reciting the Gettysburg address, I must say I raised an eyebrow.  The rest of the film supposedly reenacted Abraham Lincoln's political genius in getting the Emancipation Proclamation through Congress.  It was all about the compromises and political persuasion it took.  We all know how this all turned out of course.The acting was excellent even though Daniel-Day Lewis doesn't really look like Abraham Lincoln.  But as far as I'm concerned it was Tommy Lee Jones cast as Thaddeus Stevens whose performance was the most outstanding.Sally Field was cast as Lincoln's wife but I think the screenwriters went much too far in making her sound like a modern feminist.  I found myself reacting negatively every time she opened her mouth.I also think that the trailer for the film which included a battle scene was misleading.  This was not a film about the War in the field.  It was a about a political war played out in Congress and the audience needed to follow the political arguments between the different factions.I wasn't planning on falling asleep but I found myself dozing off several times which does not make this a film that I""m anxious to recommend.

The film has an impressive cast including Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field, Hal Holbrook, James Spader and Tommy Lee Jones and takes you behind the scenes of the Civil War battles on the field ro the political tactics of Lincoln in the push to abolish slavery through the 13th Amendment. The movie also spotlights his personal life with his wife and sons. The stress of the Civil War took its toll on the Lincolns as is evident in his pictures, and a carriage scene in the movie depicts the Lincolns looking forward to better times before the fateful night at Ford Theater.

But for those with the patience to stick it out, the movie offers an extraordinary and in-depth account of a brief but defining moment in Lincoln's career--the passing of the 13th amendment to the Constitution. Lincoln shows himself to be the consummate politician as he at turns persuades, cajoles, charms, bullies, threatens, and buys his way to the passage of what at first seems a measure that is doomed to fail. Indeed, at first blush his chances appear well nigh hopeless as even his otherwise faithful cabinet seems to doubt him and even his sanity. But Lincoln's energy, zeal, and sheer craftiness and popularity with the public are no match for his opponents. And when tensions run too high, not the least of his talents is that Lincoln always had a funny story or anecdote to defuse the situation.I was also pleased to see so many fine character actors in various roles (such as Bruce McGill and Walton Goggins) who are not as well known to the general public compared to Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, and David Spader, who had major parts. Jones was superb as the fast talking Thaddeus Stephens and of course Sally Fields is a long way from ""The Flying Nun"" with her riveting portrayal of Mary Todd Lincoln.Overall a fine movie with a career climaxing and defining performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, who shows that, when it came to Lincoln and his 13th Amendment, that if you were against it, ""He will find you!"" :-)******Note: An allusion to Day-Lewis's famous line in ""Last of the Mohicans.""",5,A brief comment,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,1833,"['Please', 'note', 'saw', 'movie', 'channel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'features.Lincoln', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'wordy', 'archaic', 'dialog', 'will', 'be', 'off-putting', 'modern', 'viewers', 'confirmed', 'reading', 'several', 'dozen', 'reviews', 'patience', 'stick', 'out', 'movie', 'extraordinary', 'in-depth', 'account', 'brief', 'defining', 'moment', 'Lincoln', 'career', 'passing', '13th', 'amendment', 'Constitution', 'Lincoln', 'be', 'consummate', 'politician', 'persuades', 'cajoles', 'charms', 'bullies', 'threatens', 'way', 'passage', 'what', 'first', 'measure', 'doomed', 'fail', 'Indeed', 'first', 'blush', 'chances', 'appear', 'well', 'nigh', 'hopeless', 'even', 'otherwise', 'faithful', 'cabinet', 'doubt', 'even', 'sanity', 'Lincoln', 'energy', 'zeal', 'sheer', 'craftiness', 'popularity', 'public', 'are', 'match', 'opponents', 'when', 'tensions', 'run', 'too', 'high', 'not', 'least', 'talents', 'Lincoln', 'always', 'had', 'funny', 'story', 'anecdote', 'defuse', 'situation.I', 'was', 'also', 'pleased', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'various', 'roles', 'such', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'general', 'public', 'compared', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'David', 'Spader', 'who', 'had', 'major', 'parts', 'Jones', 'was', 'superb', 'fast', 'talking', 'Thaddeus', 'Stephens', 'course', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'long', 'way', 'Flying', 'Nun', 'riveting', 'portrayal', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln.Overall', 'fine', 'movie', 'career', 'climaxing', 'defining', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'who', 'when', 'came', 'Lincoln', '13th', 'Amendment', 'were', 'will', 'find', '******Note', 'allusion', 'Day-Lewis', 'famous', 'line', 'Last', 'Mohicans']",N/A

It is slavery that has rent the United States apart;  it is slavery that must end.Your Proclamation, two years ago, to free all slaves in states and parts of states that remained in rebellion, is on legally shaky ground.  The war could end with the question of slavery unsettled after the horrendous loss of life and suffering to settle this very issue ... only a change in the Constitution will work.Last year, a proposed 13th amendment to abolish slavery passed the Senate, but failed in the House.

1593175,A172YG5D6BXNK,B009AMANBA,"Malo Bo ""dramarama1""","[15, 20]","Director Steven Spielberg brings the last four months of Abraham Lincoln's life into this focused historical epic that had been long in the works.As the Civil War comes to an end, and shortly after Lincoln has won re-election, the president is faced with the process of abolishing slavery with his workings to pass the 13th Amendment through a very divided and partisan House of Representatives.  The genuine concern of this issue is palpable through the screen.The film serves not only as a political drama, but a deep character study of the Lincoln family through the turmoil of war, political impasse and the serious emotional impact of life in the White House.  At two and a half hours long, the film has a steadied and deliberate pace that certainly doesn't rush, but is certainly more concerned with maintaining both interest and reveal.Spielberg re-teams with former Munich collaborators: cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, editor Michael Kahn, screenwriter Tony Kushner and composer John Williams.  They were all nominated for Academy Awards for their work on Lincoln.  The production design, costume design and editing are absolutely remarkable, as big-budget historical epics rely on the excelled success of depicting the past, telling a story out of time, and making it feel and look accurate.  Lincoln succeeds in a great manor.When it comes down to the film, however, more than Spielberg's directing, the impact of the film relies on the layered and masterful performances of its actors.  Daniel Day-Lewis obviously won his third Best Actor Oscar for his role as the president.  He is a powerhouse throughout the whole film, yet, in his chameleon way, he strives for the restrained dignity and humanism of his character.  However, David Straitharn, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, John Hawkes, and Hal Holbrook all give absolutely masterful veteran performances as well.  James Spader and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also deliver noteworthy performances.  This is clearly an ensemble film cast and finished by the hands of a master.The dark, brooding look and feel of the film is paired perfectly with its serious, conversational tone.  This is yet another masterwork from Spielberg, which, at this point in his career, his audience never expects anything less.I watched part of the film on my laptop and the second half through my Playstation on the big screen.  The streaming was clear and the sound was even better, probably not as good as the Blu-ray release, but it didn't disappoint. The nuances of the accents and the breaths between the speeches and stories are affecting and rousing.Great film, highly recommended.  One of the few films I had no qualms paying as much as I used to at the video store to watch.  I would love to re-watch in Blu-ray, which always says something about a film that is worthy to view multiple times.",5,Lincoln: Brilliant Historical Epic,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,2838,"['Director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'last', 'four', 'months', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'focused', 'historical', 'epic', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'works.As', 'Civil', 'War', 'end', 'shortly', 'Lincoln', 'won', 're-election', 'president', 'faced', 'process', 'abolishing', 'slavery', 'workings', 'pass', '13th', 'Amendment', 'very', 'divided', 'partisan', 'House', 'Representatives', 'genuine', 'concern', 'issue', 'palpable', 'screen.The', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'political', 'drama', 'deep', 'character', 'study', 'Lincoln', 'family', 'turmoil', 'war', 'political', 'impasse', 'serious', 'emotional', 'impact', 'life', 'White', 'House', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'film', 'steadied', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'rush', 'certainly', 'more', 'concerned', 'maintaining', 'interest', 'reveal.Spielberg', 're-teams', 'former', 'Munich', 'collaborators', 'cinematographer', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'editor', 'Michael', 'Kahn', 'screenwriter', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'composer', 'John', 'Williams', 'were', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'work', 'Lincoln', 'production', 'design', 'costume', 'design', 'editing', 'are', 'absolutely', 'remarkable', 'big-budget', 'historical', 'epics', 'rely', 'excelled', 'success', 'depicting', 'past', 'telling', 'story', 'time', 'making', 'feel', 'look', 'accurate', 'Lincoln', 'great', 'manor.When', 'down', 'film', 'however', 'more', 'Spielberg', 'directing', 'impact', 'film', 'relies', 'layered', 'masterful', 'performances', 'actors', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'obviously', 'won', 'third', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'role', 'president', 'powerhouse', 'whole', 'film', 'yet', 'chameleon', 'way', 'restrained', 'dignity', 'humanism', 'character', 'However', 'David', 'Straitharn', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Sally', 'Field', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'give', 'absolutely', 'masterful', 'veteran', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'James', 'Spader', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'clearly', 'ensemble', 'film', 'cast', 'finished', 'hands', 'master.The', 'dark', 'brooding', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'paired', 'perfectly', 'serious', 'conversational', 'tone', 'yet', 'masterwork', 'Spielberg', 'point', 'career', 'audience', 'never', 'anything', 'less.I', 'watched', 'part', 'film', 'laptop', 'second', 'half', 'Playstation', 'big', 'screen', 'streaming', 'was', 'clear', 'sound', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'probably', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'nuances', 'accents', 'breaths', 'speeches', 'stories', 'are', 'affecting', 'rousing.Great', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended', 'One', 'few', 'films', 'had', 'qualms', 'paying', 'as', 'much', 'used', 'video', 'store', 'watch', 'would', 'love', 're-watch', 'Blu-ray', 'always', 'something', 'film', 'worthy', 'view', 'multiple', 'times']",N/A

1593188,AAYE34TCTNV2R,B009AMANBA,MarlowesMom,"[7, 10]","My son has to do a big report about Abraham Lincoln in school this week and Daniel Day-Lewis seems born to play Lincoln. So I broke my resolution not to see another Spielberg movie (see my review of ""Schindler's List"" if you're interested) and the whole family went to see ""Lincoln."" This is, I think, very much a lawyer's movie, and my verdict is ""not great, but not bad at all."" Four stars.""Lincoln"" wisely does not attempt to offer a sweeping account of the 16th U.S. president's remarkable life and times in its two and a half hour running time. Rather, through its focus on efforts to get the House of Representatives to pass the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolishing slavery, it offers a character study of Lincoln as arm-twisting political strategist, Commander in Chief, folk philosopher, husband and father.For a Speilberg movie, ""Lincoln"" is remarkably quiet. We do see gruesome piles of bodies on the Civil War battlefields, and the requisite Spielberg bursting into song at the moment of triumph. (""Battle Cry of Freedom"" is sung on the floor of the House of Representatives after the vote passing the amendment. Contemporary northern newspaper accounts I was able to find indicate that there was much exultation and cheering on the House Floor and around Washington after the vote, but I didn't see anything about Congressmen bursting into song.) In a highly unlikely scene, a racially mixed pair of Union soldiers recites Lincoln's Gettysburg address to him when meeting him so that bit of brilliant oratory can be fit into the movie without taking it out of its early 1865 time frame.Overall, though, Tony Kushner's literate and often stylized script gives us intimate scenes of  Lincoln's interactions with his high-strung wife Mary Todd, with his son Robert, and with his troops. Most screen time is taken up with meetings between Lincoln and his advisers about the need for the amendment as both a legal matter to ensure slavery does not continue after the war and as a step to expedite the war's end, the timing for its passage (before the Southern States are back and able to vote it down), and how to get enough votes from among lame-duck Democratic Congressmen who have been voted out of office to pass the amendment. These detailed analytical discussions will appeal to political junkies and legal scholars, but they may drag a bit for the more casual viewer. Our ten-year-old was fidgety and made frequent trips to the water fountain outside the auditorium.Lincoln is beautifully cast so we enjoy a number of remarkable supporting performances: David Strathairn as Secretary of State William Seward, Sally Field as the neurotic Mrs. Lincoln, Jackie Earle Haley as Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, and best of all to my taste, Tommy Lee Jones as radical anti-slavery Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, to name a just few.Day-Lewis is off on another planet as Abraham Lincoln, which is both a brilliant piece of acting and, at least for me, somewhat off-putting. While he does a lovely job capturing Lincoln's intellect, political savvy, folksy humor and cynicism, because he has gone so far away into his character, I often felt that he was calling out to the other characters from a great distance rather than interacting intimately with them. The performance might have worked better in a one-man show. The makeup used to create the deep furrows in his brow seemed strangely immobile.Through ""Lincoln"" we learn, if we did not already know, that passing controversial legislation is a long hard slog through the mud. It's a great challenge to dramatize a long hard slog through the mud, even when the result is as world-changing as the end of slavery. ""Lincoln"" does the job about as well as can be expected. I have nothing but praise for Spielberg's keeping a curb bit on his mawkish manipulative tendencies and crowd-pleasing instincts in this smart, well-made movie that will not be to everyone's taste.",4,Laws and Sausages,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,3963,"['son', 'do', 'big', 'report', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'school', 'week', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'born', 'play', 'Lincoln', 'So', 'broke', 'resolution', 'not', 'see', 'Spielberg', 'movie', 'see', 'review', 'Schindler', 'List', ""'re"", 'interested', 'whole', 'family', 'went', 'see', 'Lincoln', 'think', 'very', 'much', 'lawyer', 'movie', 'verdict', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'bad', 'Four', 'stars', 'Lincoln', 'wisely', 'not', 'attempt', 'offer', 'sweeping', 'account', '16th', 'U.S.', 'president', 'remarkable', 'life', 'times', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'Rather', 'focus', 'efforts', 'get', 'House', 'Representatives', 'pass', '13th', 'Amendment', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'abolishing', 'slavery', 'character', 'study', 'Lincoln', 'arm-twisting', 'political', 'strategist', 'Commander', 'Chief', 'folk', 'philosopher', 'husband', 'father.For', 'Speilberg', 'movie', 'Lincoln', 'remarkably', 'quiet', 'do', 'see', 'gruesome', 'piles', 'bodies', 'Civil', 'War', 'battlefields', 'requisite', 'Spielberg', 'bursting', 'song', 'moment', 'triumph', 'Battle', 'Cry', 'Freedom', 'sung', 'floor', 'House', 'Representatives', 'vote', 'passing', 'amendment', 'Contemporary', 'northern', 'newspaper', 'accounts', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'indicate', 'was', 'much', 'exultation', 'cheering', 'House', 'Floor', 'Washington', 'vote', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'Congressmen', 'bursting', 'song', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'scene', 'racially', 'mixed', 'pair', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'Lincoln', 'Gettysburg', 'address', 'when', 'meeting', 'so', 'bit', 'brilliant', 'oratory', 'can', 'be', 'fit', 'movie', 'taking', 'early', '1865', 'time', 'frame.Overall', 'though', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'literate', 'often', 'stylized', 'script', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'Lincoln', 'interactions', 'high-strung', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'son', 'Robert', 'troops', 'Most', 'screen', 'time', 'taken', 'up', 'meetings', 'Lincoln', 'advisers', 'need', 'amendment', 'legal', 'matter', 'ensure', 'slavery', 'not', 'continue', 'war', 'step', 'expedite', 'war', 'end', 'timing', 'passage', 'Southern', 'States', 'are', 'back', 'able', 'vote', 'down', 'how', 'get', 'enough', 'votes', 'lame-duck', 'Democratic', 'Congressmen', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'voted', 'office', 'pass', 'amendment', 'detailed', 'analytical', 'discussions', 'will', 'appeal', 'political', 'junkies', 'legal', 'scholars', 'may', 'drag', 'bit', 'more', 'casual', 'viewer', 'ten-year-old', 'was', 'fidgety', 'made', 'frequent', 'trips', 'water', 'fountain', 'auditorium.Lincoln', 'beautifully', 'cast', 'enjoy', 'number', 'remarkable', 'supporting', 'performances', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Secretary', 'State', 'William', 'Seward', 'Sally', 'Field', 'neurotic', 'Mrs.', 'Lincoln', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Confederate', 'Vice', 'President', 'Alexander', 'Stephens', 'best', 'taste', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'radical', 'anti-slavery', 'Republican', 'Congressman', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'name', 'just', 'few.Day-Lewis', 'planet', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'acting', 'least', 'somewhat', 'off-putting', 'lovely', 'job', 'capturing', 'Lincoln', 'intellect', 'political', 'savvy', 'folksy', 'humor', 'cynicism', 'gone', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'character', 'often', 'felt', 'was', 'calling', 'out', 'other', 'characters', 'great', 'distance', 'rather', 'interacting', 'intimately', 'performance', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'one-man', 'show', 'makeup', 'used', 'create', 'deep', 'furrows', 'brow', 'seemed', 'strangely', 'immobile.Through', 'Lincoln', 'learn', 'did', 'not', 'already', 'know', 'passing', 'controversial', 'legislation', 'long', 'hard', 'slog', 'mud', 'great', 'challenge', 'dramatize', 'long', 'hard', 'slog', 'mud', 'even', 'when', 'result', 'as', 'world-changing', 'end', 'slavery', 'Lincoln', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'have', 'nothing', 'praise', 'Spielberg', 'keeping', 'curb', 'bit', 'mawkish', 'manipulative', 'tendencies', 'crowd-pleasing', 'instincts', 'smart', 'well-made', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste']",N/A

If Spielberg was going for a somber, dreary, old photo kinda thing, he accomplished that but he did it so well that it's like being locked in a dusty closet.  Movie Making 101A might be, ""Let Your Viewers HEAR Your Movie Properly"".  The sound levels go from a soft whisper to a loud, dramatic, forced sound so that I was constantly adjusting the level on my laptop and that's also ridiculous and hurt my ears.  If visual and audio are not handled well, a good, strong story can save any movie, really.  But, nope, not here.  It's really true.

But, the story line is so choppy and impossible to follow that I gave up and slept for about 20 minutes and when I awoke, it made no difference that I'd missed a chunk of the movie.  It was still grinding its painfully slow way towards the 13th Amendment.  Lincoln's death scene, or should I say LACK of a proper death scene is unforgivable.  They actually show another play going on in another theatre when the announcement of the shooting comes!  I'm not kidding.  To make him look like a buffoon with his lame jokes at inappropriate times is also unforgivable for such a man.  All in all, I'm furious when the subject matter has such grand potential and the seemingly best are on task to tell the story and then it falls apart.

I believe he performed a mighty service by preserving Lincoln's dedication to the anti-slavery cause on film, especially how Lincoln proceeded with a deadly war even while reconciliation with the South was possible if he had simply relented and allowed slavery to continue in the Southern states in a postwar union.More things to like: Lincoln's shrewd political maneuvering even as he appeared to be little more than a folksy charmer on the outside.

However, in sum this movie didn't live up to what it could be.  The story focuses on the end of the Civil War and Lincoln's push to get the 13th Ammendment through the House of Representatives.  Lincoln talks about how he used the powers granted to him because of the war, to pass the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing the slaves.  He gives a difficut explanation of why he passed it and what he believes in.  He keeps saying that he follows the rule of law or something like that and how African Americans are viewed as property by law.  This difficult to understand reasoning that he provides is one of the many things that undermine this film from being better.There is a good piece of history in this film and we see Congress and the White House well reproduced.  One thing that is obvious is the White House had no fence and no security.  I knew this from reading Killing Lincoln but it was still amazing to see it portrayed so realistically.I had great difficulty understanding what many of the actors were saying even Sally Field started prattling on with 1865 idioms making her difficult to understand.  So many recognizable faces gave me the same trouble whether it was Hal Holbrook or James Spader.Another thing the movie suffered from was it just got boring at times.  Yes there were dramatic parts as Spader and his crew try to sway some of the Lame Duck Democrats to vote for the Ammendment and we saw that the same corruption that exists in Washington today happened back then.Tommy Lee Jones was excellent in his role though he wears an annoying wig through most of the movie.  Joseph Gordon Levitt is excellent as Lincoln's son who fights with his father over enlisting in the war.Finally, Daniel Day Lewis was a good Lincoln, looking a lot like Lincoln, but his voice didn't sound very Lincolnesque.",3,This Movie Could Have Been a Lot Better,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1924,"['movie', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'individual', 'parts', 'really', 'good', 'cast', 'great', 'director', 'National', 'icon', 'However', 'sum', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'story', 'end', 'Civil', 'War', 'Lincoln', 'push', 'get', '13th', 'Ammendment', 'House', 'Representatives', 'Lincoln', 'talks', 'how', 'used', 'powers', 'granted', 'war', 'pass', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'freeing', 'slaves', 'difficut', 'explanation', 'why', 'passed', 'what', 'saying', 'rule', 'law', 'something', 'how', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'viewed', 'property', 'law', 'difficult', 'understand', 'reasoning', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'undermine', 'film', 'being', 'good', 'piece', 'history', 'film', 'see', 'Congress', 'White', 'House', 'well', 'reproduced', 'One', 'thing', 'obvious', 'White', 'House', 'had', 'fence', 'security', 'knew', 'reading', 'Killing', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'still', 'amazing', 'see', 'portrayed', 'so', 'realistically.I', 'had', 'great', 'difficulty', 'understanding', 'what', 'many', 'actors', 'were', 'saying', 'even', 'Sally', 'Field', 'started', 'prattling', '1865', 'idioms', 'making', 'difficult', 'understand', 'So', 'many', 'recognizable', 'gave', 'same', 'trouble', 'was', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'James', 'Spader.Another', 'thing', 'movie', 'suffered', 'was', 'just', 'got', 'boring', 'times', 'were', 'dramatic', 'parts', 'Spader', 'crew', 'try', 'sway', 'Lame', 'Duck', 'Democrats', 'vote', 'Ammendment', 'saw', 'same', 'corruption', 'Washington', 'today', 'happened', 'back', 'then.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'was', 'excellent', 'role', 'annoying', 'wig', 'most', 'movie', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'excellent', 'Lincoln', 'son', 'who', 'father', 'enlisting', 'war.Finally', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'was', 'good', 'Lincoln', 'looking', 'lot', 'Lincoln', 'voice', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'very', 'Lincolnesque']",N/A

It takes place over the last few months of Lincoln's life in 1865 and consists primarily of conversations  -or more often arguments- between Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward (David Straithairn), Lincoln and radical Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), Lincoln and Republican party founder Francis Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook), and many more, as the President wheels, deals, lies, bribes resistant Democrats, and misleads Congress to get the votes for the 13th Amendment. His own advisors oppose the plan at first, and second, as a fight he can't win, and prefer to use the threat of the 13th Amendment to pressure the Confederacy into a surrender.Steven Spielberg directed this mess, with a screenplay by playwright Tony Kushner. To say it is talky would miss the mark. It's more prattle than talk. Lincoln is a self-righteous windbag who will put on a speech to whomever will listen. It's not believable that anyone would listen after a while. He's distasteful, preachy, and sometimes pretty silly, as when he goes on about Euclid to some telegraph operators. We feel the weight of the War on Lincoln's shoulders, but he does not seem to be a man grounded in reality. I have no idea how the filmmakers intended Lincoln to come across, but I doubt  their intentions were realized. When ""Lincoln"" is not mired by its title character, it is bogged down in legal and political intricacies. Some comic relief is provided in the form of Republican lackeys who are charged with buying Democratic votes, but that's not as funny as it should be. Thankfully, Tommy Lee Jones steals his scenes as the radical and outspoken Stevens.Though it is refreshing to see people yell at each other on the floor of Congress, rather than the oppressive politeness we have today, those few scenes can't save the film. ""Lincoln"" is a political drama without the drama. It is far too long at 2 1/2 hours. The conflict Lincoln has with his son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a pointless distraction, as this is less a biography of Lincoln than a chronicle of Capital Hill politics. The last 20 minutes are a sort of epilogue that should have been cut. The super-dark interiors are super-conspicuous CGI. There is no light in the rooms during the daytime. There is light at the window, but it does not come in, as if some invisible force were repelling it. Lincoln and his advisors are left to read in daylit rooms that are...dark. The out-of-doors suffers a similar problem. Everything is blue, and the lighting conditions are perpetually at dusk. The cast is top-notch, however. I really should swear off new Spielberg films.

The movie should've really been called Slave liberation or something. The film does give some development and conflict for Lincoln, which is good.

Tommy Lee Jones, who always turns in a good performance, does great as well. Sally Field, who played Lincoln's wife does a good job acting wise. However, her character was annoying and a bit crazy, in my opinion. She might have been like that in real life, but I still found it annoying. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is barely in the film, and does not do much.The production values are great. They really captured the image of Civil War timeframe. The story was also good.

Oleson,"[3, 4]","Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner adapt a snippet from Doris Kearns Goodwin's award winning book and rewards movie goers with one of the best movies of the year.  Spanning less than 4 months beginning in January of 1865, the film and Lincoln's (remarkable Daniel Day-Lewis) focus is on the passing and ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution which abolishes slavery.The nation was begging for an end to the Civil War which had killed over 600 thousand Americans and nearly destroyed the economy.  Although Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation theoretically freed the slaves, Lincoln knew it was a wartime fiat that he feared would not pass muster in peacetime.  He was reluctant to end the war until the Amendment solidified his position.  This was not an easy task.Although his conservative Republicans were against slavery some were concerned this might lead to further rights such as voting.  If trying to hold his own majority party in line wasn't difficult enough he had to convince 20 Democrats to also vote his way.  As a result he was forced to strike a deal with Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), a Democratic abolitionist to wrangle a few votes.All the while Lincoln was dealing with his wife Mary (wonderful Sally Field) who was still trying to manage her grief after losing her son two year earlier.  Spielberg for the most part, spares the audience the theatrics and focuses on the character of the president and his folksy way of garnering support.  Adept at story telling Lincoln manages to conjure up just the right yarn to make his point.In one scene Lincoln is about to send a telegram to Gen. Grant to bring the Southern peace delegation to Washington, something he does not want to do until the amendment passes.  With only the telegraph operator and an engineer present he asks them if they are familiar with Euclid's common notion.  He then quotes the theory of how if things are equal to the same things they are also equal to each other.  This is a self-evident truth of mathematics.  He decides not to have the delegation come to Washington.The great enjoyment of this educational and entertaining film is the great words, the great acting and the great moviemaking.

He speaks both softly and wisely, with a good story always ready to share with others. I think come February he will be the first man to win 3 lead acting Oscars (he should have won for Gangs of New York too).

Both of them transport you into their roles as though you, yourself, are seeing out of their eyes.Spielberg has made an essential film which will always live in the lofty atmosphere of ""Schindler's List.""Lincoln had messy hair and he hated when it was neat.  He challenged any tall man to stand back-to-back with him and his six foot, three and three quarter inch height usually made him the victor.  Lincoln was undoubtedly the strongest president we ever had.  He had more physical altercations than any professional fighter and came away with a better record than most.OK, there was too little time in this film to dwell on the stuff that made Lincoln a very funny and entertaining man.  To do Lincoln real justice, that other American jewel named Tony Kushner (Angels in America), would have had to have given us another six hour film that could only have been made for the small screen.If you want to know A. Lincoln as few others do. If you want a real treat, read Carl Sandburg's ""Abraham Lincoln,"" and don't you dare read the short version.  Read all six volumes.  It will be one of the top experiences of your life.  A Carl Sandburg sentence is a marvel to behold and the film LINCOLN by Kushner-Spielberg-Day-Lewis & Co. is a gift to the American people of the highest value.ARGO f-yourself took the Academy Award for Best Picture, but LINCOLN was the best picture of 2012 by a country mile.I would be remiss if I did not mention Sally Field for her thoughtful portrayal of Mary Todd-Lincoln.  I throw my hat in the air in celebration of James Spader's representation of W.N. Bilbo.  Hal Holbrook and John Hawkes added importantly to the film.Tommy-Lee Jones has played his best role to date as Thaddeus Stevens.

The movie was accurate to a fault, but leave it to Spielberg to go to the extent of using the sound of the actual doors opening of the real courthouse in the story , of the creaking sounds of the actual floor creaking, and even the sound of a person as they stood from the pew where Lincoln actually sat in real life and putting these sounds into the film. Daniel Day Lewis was superb but he seems to like to play roles in historical movies (The Last of the Mohicans), and although I have never been a strong Sally Fields fan her personality flaws as Mary Todd Lincoln seemed totally believable.

There is very little melodrama in this film's two and a half hour running time. Even John William's score is mostly quiet, creating a contemplative mood in its viewers, underscoring the mindset of the film's central character.Even though the film focuses mostly on one month in the life of Abraham Lincoln, his life story comes through in his interactions with Mary, Tad, Robert, Seward and others, providing a more complete sense of who Lincoln was than in any other film about him.This is definately a must see film (eventually a must own film in my blu-ray collection) and one that deserves every accolade it should (and most likely will) win.",5,This is how you make a historical drama,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,1153,"['recent', 'years', 'movies', 'centering', 'historical', 'figures', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'sloppy', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'mostly', 'due', 'trend', 'packing', 'life', 'story', 'two', 'hours', 'Speilberg', 'wisely', 'mistake', 'focusing', 'biggest', 'accomplishment', 'Lincoln', 'presidency', 'battle', 'get', 'done.Here', 'finally', 'historical', 'drama', 'actually', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'addition', 'having', 'great', 'performances', 'cast.This', 'probably', 'second', 'most', 'restrained', 'film', 'Speilberg', 'career', 'very', 'little', 'melodrama', 'film', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'Even', 'John', 'William', 'score', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'creating', 'contemplative', 'mood', 'viewers', 'underscoring', 'mindset', 'film', 'central', 'character.Even', 'film', 'mostly', 'one', 'month', 'life', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'story', 'through', 'interactions', 'Mary', 'Tad', 'Robert', 'Seward', 'others', 'providing', 'more', 'complete', 'sense', 'who', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'other', 'film', 'him.This', 'definately', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'eventually', 'must', 'own', 'film', 'blu-ray', 'collection', 'one', 'accolade', 'should', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'win']",N/A

1593290,A237RLQXTL55RG,B009AMANBA,off the tropic,"[3, 6]","Daniel Day-Lewis's near miraculous recreation of Lincoln in Spielberg's dramatization of the last few months of Lincoln's presidency may very well bring him his third Oscar in a leading role. He has strong competition from Denzel Washington, for Flight, who is my pick for this year's best actor, but Day-Lewis's brilliant depiction of America's greatest President, during his finest hour in office, is the most ""Oscar friendly"" performance this year. This is a perfect role for a richly deserving actor to break that ""Two-Oscar-Barrier"" for a starring role that has eluded the greatest actors in history from Gary Cooper, Marlon Brando and Spencer Tracy to Dustin Hoffman and Jack Nicholson.To see Daniel Day-Lewis's inspired performance as America's great statesman is to witness the re-birth of a deeper, more involved form of acting, that can only be called a small cinematic miracle. To Spielberg's credit, and to his costume and production design staff, we once again see a supremely capable actor vanishing completely into his part. The transformation is as authentic and enthralling as any in film history. There were moments in this film, when the recreation of the president and his time were so well done that the film seemed like a collection of lost footage of the actual President. The magic of this reconstruction of Lincoln and his time is so complete that at moments I felt as though I had gone back in time to eavesdrop into Lincoln's life, to see how the great man really looked, walked, and talked.The script, grave and full of high matters as it is, focuses on Lincoln's adeptness at playing the political game with his grit and honesty to pass a crucial bill that changes the country forever. The dramatic power of Lincoln's patient resolve, his unstinting instinct for justice and political gamesmanship, this meeting of high ideals and shrewdness in the face of the peculiar breed of political realities he faces shows how one individual can transcend conflict and partisanship for much larger ideals. This exceedingly difficult moment in American history, during the waning years of the civil war, is the right occasion for Lincoln's high ideals, his ""true north"", to take possession of the national consciousness. This movie is a reminder of how even the grim reality of a darkened world must ultimately make way for the larger ideals of a man of courage and high resolve.The excellence of the character portrayal of the great man, the brilliant evocation of the period of the civil war, however, seemed to stand in stark contrast to the relative ordinariness of the overall film. While Lincoln is dramatically compelling, ""Lincoln"" does get bogged down in the dramatization of the intricacies and elaborate negotiations behind Lincoln's quest to find twenty additional votes needed to amend the constitution to outlaw slavery before the end of the war. There are many moments during the film when I thought the dialogue gets tired and blunts the dramatic tension of the behind-the-scene political maneuverings.The film has all the ingredients for the makings of an unforgettable film but where it is strong on character and spectacle it is relatively weak at crucial moments in the larger telling of the story. The film just does not succeed in distilling the emotional resonance of this compelling moment of history. The all round brilliance of the main cast and its supporting acting talent from David Strathaim to Tommy Lee Jones fails to lift the film from the relatively flat setting up of the political story that unfolds.The film succeeds in flashes when it shows how Lincoln's family drama compounds rather than alleviates his political problems during crucial moments in his Presidency. These inspired moments come with a detailed rendering of Lincoln's spiritual resilience when it is tested to its limits. The crises being handed down to him by the day, by the hour, only ends up igniting Lincoln's legendary tact and patience. The great magic of this piece of cinema is how it sustains our interest in its brilliant reconstruction of both the public figure and the great man in his private life despite the pitfalls of the laborious story.In sum, ""Lincoln"" has periods of dramatic dullness largely rescued by Daniel Day-Lewis's inspired recreation of Lincoln, the man and statesman. The patience, wisdom, and political largeness of Lincoln's example shine through in a commanding rendition of Lincoln by an astonishing Day-Lewis performance. The gravity of Day-Lewis's gestures, his slow dignified movements, the near high pitched deliberative, drawl of his speech, goes beyond being just Lincolnesque; it as if a resurrected Lincoln moves before our eyes on screen.

1593308,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B009AMANBA,Paul Allaer,"[4, 6]","""Lincoln"" (2012 release; 150 min.) is the latest Steven Spielberg-directed historical drama (others include Schindlers' List and Saving Private Ryan, just to name those). Not knowing much more besides having seen the trailer for is a few times, I really didn't know what to expect, and was eagerly looking forward to seeing it.Here is what I got: first and foremost, despite the name of the movie, this is NOT a movie about Lincoln as such. Instead it is a historical drama in which Lincoln plays a significant role, and the movie is roughly set up in two major parts: (i) the first half introduces the various characters and ref;lects the debate whether or not the 13th Amendment (abolishing slavery) should be passed before the looming end of the Civil War, and why Lincoln felt it was paramount that it was indeed voted on before the end of the war, and (ii) the second half of the movie focuses primarily on what the Republican-controlled House of Representatives needed to do to get 20 Demcratic votes to vote ""yes"", so as to get to the 2/3 majority required for passing a Constitutional Amendment, and how President Lincoln orchestrated it all. Lincoln seduces, cajoles, begs, tyrannizes, and even offers bribes (in the form of patronage jobs) to get the required votes. In that sense, this is a movie with a very narrow scope, even if brought on an epic scale.A few additional thoughts: Daniel Day-Lewis is nothing short of brilliant in his portrayal of Lincoln, and I would be shocked if he didn't at least get an Oscar nomination for this (and he might very well win). The other acting surprise is of course Sally Field as Lincoln's wife: in the (too-short) screen time she is given, Field brings a fiery performance. The scene/argument between the President and his wife relative to their oldest son wanting to join the Army is one of the more dramatic of the entire movie and it didn't even have to do with the main theme of the movie (passing of the 13th Amendment). I really enjoyed this movie, although I thought it was a bit over-long at 2 1/2 hours and could've benefited from some tighter editing. Kudos also to John Williams for a very understated, almost sober, yet very fine music score for this film.

1593322,A4ZW3DE87ZLL5,B009AMANBA,Pezman419,"[2, 3]","As a civil war historian, I was curious to see how this film was going to play out. I think this country has turned the Romantic Notion of Lincoln into myth, and has not seriously engaged all his political maneuverings, idiosyncrasies, and suppression of constitutional rights. He did some great things, do not get me wrong, but he also had a dark side that most people don't want to talk about. Combined with that, modern American culture (Hollywood in particular) loves to denigrate and stereotype the South as redneck racists and whatnot. So, I was curious to see how fair and balanced historically this film would be. There have been many numerous historical critiques of this film. There are well documented reviews out there that some of this film is sheer fiction. I won't go into that. I understand the need for creative license for the sake of telling the story.Factual inaccuracies aside, I found the film interesting. The portrayal of Lincoln as a human being, particularly his family life with a wife who had all sorts of behavior and mental problems is worth watching. We often want to view Lincoln as this knight in shining armor or something, and he was a man like any other man. I don't think they got his accent right. He would have had a very crude, Kentucky backwoods accent that was often described as &#34;nasally&#34; and high pitched. Day Lewis portrays him as a much more regal, deep voice, which I found odd, but that's just casting. I did appreciate the way Day Lewis tried to portray Lincoln as a storyteller that would constantly tell these yarns and off color anecdotes that often drove people crazy about him. That is accurate. I was somewhat unhappy that the casting could not find a Southerner (what few there were actually in the film) with an actual Southern accent. This is typical of Hollywood. But this film is more about the North, so that is just a side irritation.Again, it is worth watching, though I think it ran a bit long (almost 2.5 hours). It got bogged down a bit in a few places and could have used a bit more editing. I felt there were some scenes that could have been cut that were not really in keeping with the actual plot.",3,"Fair, but wasn't as great as I was expecting",1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2175,"['civil', 'war', 'historian', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'think', 'country', 'turned', 'Romantic', 'Notion', 'Lincoln', 'myth', 'not', 'seriously', 'engaged', 'political', 'maneuverings', 'idiosyncrasies', 'suppression', 'constitutional', 'rights', 'did', 'great', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'wrong', 'also', 'had', 'dark', 'side', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'Combined', 'modern', 'American', 'culture', 'Hollywood', 'particular', 'denigrate', 'stereotype', 'South', 'redneck', 'racists', 'whatnot', 'So', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'fair', 'balanced', 'historically', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'numerous', 'historical', 'critiques', 'film', 'are', 'well', 'documented', 'film', 'sheer', 'fiction', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'understand', 'need', 'creative', 'license', 'sake', 'telling', 'story.Factual', 'inaccuracies', 'aside', 'found', 'film', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'Lincoln', 'human', 'being', 'particularly', 'family', 'life', 'wife', 'who', 'had', 'sorts', 'behavior', 'mental', 'problems', 'worth', 'watching', 'often', 'want', 'view', 'Lincoln', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'something', 'was', 'man', 'other', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'got', 'accent', 'right', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'crude', 'Kentucky', 'backwoods', 'accent', 'was', 'often', 'described', '34', 'nasally', '34', 'high', 'pitched', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'much', 'more', 'regal', 'deep', 'voice', 'found', 'odd', 'just', 'casting', 'did', 'appreciate', 'way', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'tried', 'portray', 'Lincoln', 'storyteller', 'would', 'constantly', 'tell', 'yarns', 'color', 'often', 'drove', 'people', 'crazy', 'accurate', 'was', 'somewhat', 'unhappy', 'casting', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'Southerner', 'what', 'few', 'were', 'actually', 'film', 'actual', 'Southern', 'accent', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'more', 'North', 'just', 'side', 'irritation.Again', 'worth', 'watching', 'think', 'ran', 'bit', 'long', 'almost', '2.5', 'hours', 'got', 'bogged', 'down', 'bit', 'few', 'places', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'editing', 'felt', 'were', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'keeping', 'actual', 'plot']",N/A

Off the top of my head, I can think of no actor who has done better in disappearing into his or her role.  When I do stop and think about it, this man is still among the best.  Our 16th President came to life on the screen nearly 150 years after that fateful night at Ford's Theater.Another actor who must be celebrated for disappearing into his role is Tommy Lee Jones, who played Congressman Thaddeus Stevens.  Mr. Jones is one of those actors who I can usually readily recognize from their first on-screen appearance.  This film is the exception.  Instead of the actor who's played gruff lawmen, rogue CIA agents, high-ranking military officials, etc., I saw a man truly passionate about a cause which he intended to see through to the end.I have no opinion either way of Sally Field and her portrayal of First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln.  I guess my problem with her is that she didn't contribute anything to the agenda in the film...mainly passing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and abolishing slavery once and for all.  But in the name of historical accuracy, I'm glad she was in this film and based on what I know about her, Sally Field portrayed her struggles quite well.  I ultimately applaud the performance.Overall, the cast as a whole did great.  A genuine effort was made on everyone's part to make this film as historically accurate as possible.  Even director Steven Spielberg, a man known for going the extra mile for the sake of historical accuracy when it matters (i.e. Saving Private Ryan), has outdone himself here.  I mean, he got one of his crew to record the ticking sounds of Abraham Lincoln's actual pocket watch to incorporate them into the film.The story too was great.  Sure, things were a bit slow at times, but those were short times and had to be included because events like that actually happened.  I loved the trailer for this film.  It was obvious that Spielberg took the most riveting lines and scenes and put together a great preview to draw in his audience.  My favorite parts of the movie were when those lines and scenes were put into full context, increasing their already five-star awesomeness.I also liked learning about where things like the famous phrase ""we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal"" came from.  While I can't be sure if all these origins are in fact true, the fact that Spielberg is directing lends a certain validity to the accounts.  I'm definitely inspired to research this stuff further.In the end, I definitely recommend this film as well as the bookTeam of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincolnby Doris Kearns Goodwin.  The film is great, but only a part of the book inspired it...there's a lot more in the latter.  Definitely watch and read both.

I'm no expert in either of these areas but left the big screen venue feeling intellectually satisfied.I did detect some strange anachronisms, though, namely the overtly ""feminist""(yet conspicuously prissy), Mary, and an unnecessary concluding scene with Tommy Lee Jones (yes, he should get an Oscar) and Mrs. Lincoln's the African-American assistant at 1600. I think Speilberg made his statement without any semi-patronizing confirmation of Thaddeus Stevens' motives and vision.I was most impressed when I learned that, yes, the problems continued after the Emancipation Proclamation and it took a mass of political battering rams to ""codify"" the new way of Life. An adjustment to the white guy/slave holder-written Constitution was needed.

This film was unusual in that it really centered on Lincoln's efforts to pass the thirteenth amendment which freed the slaves.  Of course the terrible Civil War was the foremost challenge of his term, but most of this movie is how Lincoln and those close to him went about trying to garner votes for a very controversial amendment.  This is really the first time I've seen Lincoln in a different light.  He comes across as not the eloquent speaker of the Gettysburg Address, but most of the time he is seen as a bumpkin, using bad grammar, telling off color jokes, and really putting across a more human side rather than the larger than life image that we hear about.  Mostly he acted this way around his close advisors and his wife, Mary, and he never appeared shaken and that is probably why the jokes and stories.  It was to deflect from the terrible things that were going on around him.  Sally Field in her role as Mary Lincoln really captures her in looks, mannerisms, and is the long suffering depressed woman that we know.  Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stephens, the very passionate Congressman who supported Lincoln and the thirteenth amendment did a good job.  I almost didn't recognize him!

It took something as promising as ""Lincoln"" to get me to drive to my local cineplex, stand in line, sit way up close in one of the few remaining seats and sit through seemingly interminable previews.  After all, who doesn't love Abraham Lincoln and Daniel-Day Lewis?Be aware that this isn't a biopic of Lincoln's life.  It focuses on one event in his life,  his attempt to pass the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and thereby to abolish slavery.  There is passing reference to ending the Civil War but that seems almost like a side issue.  The parallels to the trials of our present President are interesting.  Here is a second term President, newly re-elected, with an iron will to pass through his own initiatives but is faced with opposition in the House of Representatives.  The Amendment has already passed the Senate some time earlier.  In this case it's the Republicans who are on the side of justice and equality for Blacks and the Democrats who are opposing it.  It would be fun to see the film with Obama and hear his reactions.There is a lot of talk.  It's more discussion than action so be prepared. And it's long.  Personally I would have liked more personal glimpses of Lincoln and his family.  We do see views of Mary Todd Lincoln, played by Sally Field. One of the most interesting scenes to me was the fight between them regarding letting their son enlist in the service.  This was the only scene in which we see Lincoln as a tad less than saintly, but only a tad.  The rest of the time, he was consistently wonderful.  The man probably was so but I actually got a little tired of it, especially his cute-folksy routine.  This is not a fault of Lincoln, nor of Daniel Day-Lewis, the splendid actor, but of the script and Spielberg, I think.The actors are all good.  As another reviewer commented, though, I kept seeing Sally Field up there, acting, rather than Mary Lincoln.  I have to admit, too, that I felt the same about DDL.  He almost overdid it, in my not-so humble opinion.  Likewise Tommy Lee Jones, another of my favorite actors.  He is very funny and steals every scene in which he appears but I have to wonder how accurate this portrayal was of the actual person.  I also wondered if his last scene (I won't spoil it by giving details) was of a real event. His wig is a little over the top.The film is nothing if not respectful, indeed adulatory, of a wonderful man.  To state the obvious, there is not a lot of tension for the viewer since the main problem was to pass the amendment and we all know how that turned out.  If a person had never heard of Abraham Lincoln, if such a person exists and would see this film, he would be blown away by this character.  To us it's a little underwhelming.  It is worth seeing, preferably in the comfort of your own home, with plenty of snacks, and with friends with whom you can comment about the actors.

Several other performances are compelling, notably Sally Field as Mary Lincoln, David Staitharn as the shrewd and urbane William Seward, and Tommy Lee Jones, whose tendency to chew scenery is used to very good effect in his depiction of the admirable Thaddeus Stevens.  More than anything else, this is a movie about Washington politics.  Day Lewis portrays Lincoln as an accomplished practical politician pursuing transcendent moral ends, willing to do anything short of outright bribery to secure passage of the 13th Amendment.  In addition to the high level of acting, this movie is distinguished by considerable attention to historical detail and a number of superb scences featuring Spielberg's considerable talents as a director.  The movie climaxes with the roll call vote for the 13th Amendment; a powerful and suspenseful setpiece capped by a chorus of the great Unionist song, Battle Cry of Freedom.While this movie certainly shows the tremendous racism of the period, it doesn't give a good sense of why even the conservative wing of the Republican party, and by extension, a significant majority of voters in the Northern states, were willing to abolish, as opposed to contain, slavery.  The latter was the pre-war default position of the Republicans.  These men were quite conscious of the USA's status as a republican-democratic experiment in a world dominated by monarchies and autocracies.  Over the course of the Civil War, many in the North concluded that only the extirpation of slavery would safeguard the Republic and were willing to tolerate a world with many, many free African-Americans.",4,Union Forever,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,1741,"['awfully', 'good', 'movie', 'distinguished', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'acting', 'led', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'justly', 'praised', 'performance', 'Lincoln', 'Several', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'compelling', 'notably', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Mary', 'Lincoln', 'David', 'Staitharn', 'shrewd', 'urbane', 'William', 'Seward', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'tendency', 'chew', 'scenery', 'used', 'very', 'good', 'effect', 'depiction', 'admirable', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'More', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'Washington', 'politics', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Lincoln', 'accomplished', 'practical', 'politician', 'pursuing', 'transcendent', 'moral', 'ends', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'short', 'outright', 'bribery', 'secure', 'passage', '13th', 'Amendment', 'addition', 'high', 'level', 'acting', 'movie', 'distinguished', 'considerable', 'attention', 'historical', 'detail', 'number', 'superb', 'scences', 'featuring', 'Spielberg', 'considerable', 'talents', 'director', 'movie', 'climaxes', 'roll', 'call', 'vote', '13th', 'Amendment', 'powerful', 'suspenseful', 'setpiece', 'capped', 'chorus', 'great', 'Unionist', 'song', 'Battle', 'Cry', 'Freedom.While', 'movie', 'certainly', 'tremendous', 'racism', 'period', ""n't"", 'give', 'good', 'sense', 'why', 'even', 'conservative', 'wing', 'Republican', 'party', 'extension', 'significant', 'majority', 'voters', 'Northern', 'states', 'were', 'willing', 'abolish', 'opposed', 'contain', 'slavery', 'latter', 'was', 'pre-war', 'default', 'position', 'Republicans', 'men', 'were', 'quite', 'conscious', 'USA', 'status', 'republican-democratic', 'experiment', 'world', 'dominated', 'monarchies', 'autocracies', 'course', 'Civil', 'War', 'many', 'North', 'concluded', 'only', 'extirpation', 'slavery', 'would', 'safeguard', 'Republic', 'were', 'willing', 'tolerate', 'world', 'many', 'many', 'free', 'African-Americans']",N/A

1593349,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B009AMANBA,Ranny Levy,"[3, 5]","The word FREEDOOM means so much more to me now after watching this movie. This movie is about our 16th president Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) felt that slavery is wrong so he led the Union (non-slavery states) to fight the slavery states to end slavery. This is our country's civil war. The civil war is going strong and many soldiers die from both Union States and Non Union States. Everybody wants the war to end. However, President Lincoln needs to pass the 13th amendment to outlaw slavery before he ends the war. This movie really brings our history to life. I did not understand fully what slavery is all about. Watching this movie helps me understand and realize how import freedom is. So many soldiers died for freedom.The actors in this movie are awesome. Daniel Day-Lewis did an excellent job of portraying Mr. Lincoln. His mannerism and movements are so like the 1800s. It seems like they made him a little bit taller. Tommy Lee Jones does an excellent job portraying Thaddeus Stevens. Also, Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln totally fits the role. The make-up and wardrobes are so unbelievable. Daniel Day-Lewis looks just like Mr. Lincoln with all the lines on his forehead and the wrinkle skin. The most amazing make-up is Thaddeus Stevens.The cinematography in this movie is mostly done in natural light. In 1865 there is no electricity, so the setting must be dark with candles as light. My favorite part of this movie is when the politicians are bargaining for votes. My favorite character is Mr. Lincoln.  He holds his emotions so well. He has a goal of passing the 13th amendment and he did his best to pass it and end the war. He instructs his general to treat the enemy with respect and release them to go home and not to jail. He is such an awesome person.I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 and up due to some body parts and blood. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST!

1593350,A2ZQXJD7YUIEHB,B009AMANBA,rash67,"[4, 6]","Lincoln in 1861- ""I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution . . . has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that of persons held to service. I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable.""Lincoln in 1862,  ""If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that.."" I guess he changed his mind....Lincoln- before seeing the movie I thought this was about the Emancipation Proclamation and the entire Lincoln admin. It is not. It is mostly about JAN 1865 and the 13th amendment freeing the slaves. The Emancipation Proclamation, from 2 years earlier only ""freed"" slaves in the south, where Lincoln had no jurisdiction, and no means of enforcement, but not in Maryland Delaware, DC, Pennsylvania, etc and many other places where Lincoln did! It kept the British and French from intervening on the part of the South, which they were planning to do. The other practical effect was to end enforcement of the Dred Scott case, and the Fugutive Slave Act, one of the worst pieces of legislation ever but that's another story. Even as Lincoln is crafting the amendment, he has slaves everywhere serving him...Slavery is, of course, wrong and evil. We see that now, but its wasn't so obvious to people in the Civil war.  People on both sides.  Slavery just was, like the sun coming up. These days most Civil War revisionist movies show a army of right thinking liberals and abolitionists going south to show southerners the error of their ways. Not accurate at all. This movie shows in vivid detail the varying opinions in the North from people who just wanted the long war over and had never thought out the implications of winning the war and as a result freeing the slaves. When asked by Lincoln what they thought about freedom for slaves, one couple says ""ni....s would just steal our chickens and then fight our men for their jobs"". Some couldn't care less about blacks, some want no freedom at all just an end to the four year war, some don't want blacks competing with whites for jobs, somewhat some limited freedom short of citizenship and some like the Thaddeus Stevens (wonderfully played by Tommy Lee Jones in a wig) want the full rights that blacks enjoy now and there is every opinion in between.It is worth noting that about a third of the Union Army deserted after the Emancipation Proclamation. According to their dairies, most in the Army said they fought to preserve the Union and very few were actually abolitionists.The movie shows Daniel Day Lewis is eerily masterful as Lincoln. Lincoln wants full freedom in the constitution and he wants it now while the war is ending . And like a modern day LBJ, he knows who to cajole, who to threaten and who to plead with. He tells his homespun witticisms and stories endear or annoy congressmen until one threatens to throw something at him to get him to stop. There is true debate here in Congress, Stevens calls another senator a lizard with green slime in his veins and clear proof that ""all men are not created equal"" because he is so dumb, or words to that effect. Lewis has Lincoln's walk and his stoop shouldered stance and his world-weary craggy face. Sally Fields plays Mary Todd Lincoln and is nominated for supporting actress. Sharp tongued, depressive, flighty. The real Mary Lincoln wasn't that outspoken with Lincoln's political opponents. That would have been unladylike.Not explicitly stated here is why Lincoln was in a hurry. He had no intention of punishing the South after the war. He believed in ""malice toward none, with charity for all"". It was the Republicans who would disenfranchised all men who fought for the South for a decade after the war, to punish the South for Lincoln's death and the war.  Had men in the South been able to vote on the 13th amendment it might not have passed...A lot of dark ""available light"" oil lamp shots (the light bulb not having been invented yet) . This movie was mostly shot in Richmond VA (!) where a lot of federalist style buildings remain. There is a scene supposedly the shelling of Richmond and the burning of the Tredegar Iron Works that look like Spielberg actually lit up the real building, still on the banks of the James River waterfront.Very good, very authentic all things considered, very complex. Hopefully this movie will open people's eyes to the complexities of the Civil war, even if I wish it had started earlier with Emancipation. Best Actor- Day-Lewis. Odds-on favorite to win it all, the kind of movie the Academy likes.By the way, soldiers who actually fought in the Civil War or people lived thru those times thought ""Birth of a Nation"" and later ""Gone with the Wind"" were the most accurate movies ever done about the period! Now liberals shun these movies. Now we have mostly revisionism. This movie isn't revisionist, for the most part it's accurate",5,mostly authentic -  oscar fav movie 2012,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,5075,"['Lincoln', '1861-', 'understand', 'proposed',

1593353,A3Q2Q5ZV2JQNM5,B009AMANBA,Ray H,"[1, 2]","I was surprised to see some professional critics remark that the film was nothing but a dry historical lesson. When I went to the theater, I found myself fully immersed in the film for all of its 150 minutes. Like any great movie, it tells a story very much worth telling in a fashion that's completely absorbing and gripping even if we know the outcome. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is as terrific and deserving of all the awards he won for the part. He creates a performance that feels so lived in and real that he completely embodies our 16th President for all of the film's running time. His Lincoln is a sort mischievous storyteller who has both a folksy charm and a commanding presence, and it's easy to see why the nation loved him. Supporting performances are equally strong, and include Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln, Tommy Lee Jones as abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, David Strathairn as Lincoln's secretary of state, and Joseph Gordon Levitt as Robert Todd Lincoln. The cast is filled with one remarkable performer after another. Scene stealers include Lee Pace, Michael Stuhlbarg, Walton Goggins, and of course, James Spader who creates a remarkably funny character. Spielberg doesn't get enough credit for his masterful direction and Tony Kushner's screenplay is a fascinatingly well constructed work. I could go on discussing the wonderful jobs by all of the film's crew but I won't. Needless to say, each of the film's 12 Academy Award nominations were well deserved and the film deserved more wins that it had on Oscar night.The Blu-ray looks amazing, as should any recent production. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is perfectly replicated on this Blu-ray disc which is sharp, detailed, and very film-like. The film's soundtrack is equally well replicated in 7.1-channel DTS-HD Master Audio.As you can probably tell, I loved the film enough to spring for the pricier 4-disc edition which includes a bonus disc of special features. In total, they run about 80-minutes. As always, the supplements on Spielberg's films are well produced, but I was disappointed there wasn't more. For a film dealing with such great historical significance and what I imagine was a huge production, the extras could and probably should've gone on for another two hours.

The actors and the directing were all excellent, and the writing seemed very historically-accurate, also.  For example, I've always read that Lincoln's voice was rather high and thin, but this is the first movie I've seen where Lincoln wasn't played by a baritone.  Daniel Day Lewis was highly convincing, as was Sally Field as his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln.  It was also good to see Abraham Lincoln portrayed as a real, live, quirky human being -- one whom I might believe to be a bit off-putting to his political peers.  Too often his historical importance causes writers and directors to view him as a superhuman who is so obviously correct that it would make no sense for anyone to disagree with him.  In fact, I believe the gritty, contradictory personalities and opinions of all the characters and my wondering how they could possibly be persuaded to change their minds is what created the interest of the movie.

1593361,AQV142R2H69QK,B009AMANBA,Red on Black,"[4, 6]","Very rarely a film comes along driven by a central performance of such power and verve that you realize how important is the cinematic art and leaves you pondering why it has become quite so debased. Steven Spielberg's engrossing biopic ""Lincoln"" is not the usual IMAX fodder and neither is it designed to make many concessions to the audience in terms of historical narrative or political understanding. It is based on a central part of the best political book of recent years Doris Kearns Goodwin's mammoth ""Team of Rivals"" and does cry out for a depth of knowledge of the American Civil War and the nature of the 13th Amendment to pass the abolition of slavery into the US Constitution. From this you may conclude that its dry and dusty political drama. You could not be any more wrong.At the heart of the film is Daniel Day Lewis. His performance is completely thrilling and overpowering. Kearns Goodwin has paid him the huge compliment when she recently stated that ""Daniel Day-Lewis perfectly and uncannily embodies Lincoln - from the way he looks to his mannerisms, voice, speech and conviction"". As an actor he is renown for inhabiting the part but here you will never be able to think of Lincoln again without thinking Day Lewis. He embodies all elements of the Lincoln character, he owns the cinema and you realise that you are again watching the greatest living screen actor showing how it should be done. Spielberg has long harbored a desire to make a film about the greatest American President and he has found the right man for the job. Even today the Civil War remains the great fault line in American politics and at its heart is the genius of Lincoln a politician who in the US has almost garnered saint like characteristics (go to the memorial in Washington DC and try not to be moved), The brilliance of Kearns Goodwin's book was to show him as a warts and all politician who could plot and scheme with the best of them. He used his folksy Illinois guile and savvy to navigate his way through the greatest unfinished conundrum left by the Founding Fathers the question of slavery, yet at the same time could rise to the political summit in terms of his breadth of vision and oratorical genius. Somehow Day-Lewis captures all these dimensions.Spielberg's film pitches right into the action with Union soldiers faces squashed into the mud by Confederate boots and Lincoln discussing the Gettysburg address with his troops following the battle. The film is a slow starter as we become aware of the great characters of the age not least Lincoln's ""indispensable man,"" his Secretary of State, William Seward played wonderfully by David Strathain, his tortured wife Mary ""Molly"" Todd Lincoln manically played by Sally Field and a superb supporting role in the form of Tommy Lee Jones who brings to the great leader of the Radical Republicans Thaddeus Stevens, a performance of such roaring gusto that he steals every scene. His attack on a pro slavery democrat House of Representatives member is a tour force as he spits out with cold disdain ""How can I hold that all men are created equal when here before me stands stinking the moral carcass of the gentleman from Ohio? Proof that some men are inferior. Endowed by their maker with dim wits, impermeable to reason, with cold pallid slime in their veins instead of hot red blood"". Spielberg has finally done the historical charter of Stevens a great service and rescued him from the ""mad abolitionist"" of previous portraits. Equally his telling of the story of the passing of the 13th Amendment is a model in terms of tension and pace. The introduction of James Spader heading a team of unscrupulous political lobbyists in the direct employ of Lincoln adds some nice humour.Certainly the film has mistakes. Many will point out that Mary Todd Lincoln never attended debates in the House, that black people in the film are largely ""bit part players"" and its ending does become hagiographical as it moves into Lincoln's death bed scene and his second inaugural speech. But these are small complaints. This reviewer was lucky enough to see this terrific film appropriately in a packed cinema in Chicago and it has done roaring business across the US. It is proof that not all cinemagoers want endlessly dull 3D Marvel Blockbusters or the great President cast as a ""Vampire Hunter""! Films that make you think, that chart the struggles of enlightenment and which resonate for today's events are rare beasts. If there is any justice in the world ""Lincoln"" will be recognised for what it is; namely a truly great film with a compelling central performance, a stellar supporting cast and subject fully deserving of this lavish treatment",5,"""Lincoln"" -

1593376,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B009AMANBA,Richard Masloski,"[15, 34]","As others have noted, this film's title is rather misleading as arguably the prime focus of Spielberg's work is the Thirteenth Amendment moreso than it is the title character.  Uninformed viewers might therefore be disappointed in the limited scope of the film's plot. Though I, myself, knew in advance of its narrow focus, I was disappointed in the film nonetheless.Lincoln is too great a subject to be dealt with in the restrictive fashion of this film.  LINCOLN has a fabulous actor in Daniel Day-Lewis and a legendary director in Steven Spielberg and a cast of top-shelf actors.  It also has perfect costume design and vivid and authentic set design.  What it doesn't have is a very good script.  The script is extremely dense and confusing - even for some Lincoln scholars!  It is also needlessly verbose: for example, in one scene there is a Union general approaching the camera and a subtitle comes on identifying him as General Grant.  In the next scene he is on board the riverboat to which he was headed, and is identified there within the dialog - rendering the subtitle (or which the film has way too many) unnecessary.  There is a structural imbalance in the script also: why introduce Lincoln's dream of himself on a boat steering to an unknown shore and NOT bookend it with Lincoln's precognitive dream of his own death, a dream he had just a day or so before his assassination?  Why set the celebratory church bells and flag-waving crowds at the instant of the amendment's passage and leave naught for the even more immense and joyous (for the people of the North at that time and place) celebratory spirit that exploded upon news of the end of the actual Civil War?  Why have Mary Todd Lincoln mention the fear of assassination once and only once, early in the film, and never bring its dire possibility up again towards the end of the film?  The dramatic possibility was lost, yes, but so was all sense of just how endangered a man Lincoln was - and primarily due (to Booth most-of-all) to his views on race, which would include his determination to have the amendment passed.In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and even WAR OF THE WORLDS, Spielberg peppered his dramas with immense, sprawling, extremely moving battle scenes - especially so with the opening of the former mentioned film.  The mud-pit rumble that opens LINCOLN gives us absolutely no sense at all that the political drama of the passage of the amendment took place whilst brother battled brother leading to the holocaust of 600,000 dead.  To not graphically ground the viewer in the enormity of the stakes involved somehow lessens the vital import of the film's central subject.  By not presenting a more panoramic view of the times and the places involved, the film seems, quite frankly, low budget and  claustrophobic.  The assassination itself is a lost dramatic and poetic opportunity: rather than have the news so poorly paced and abruptly announced in Grover's Theater so that little Tad Lincoln is informed of his father's having been shot, perhaps cutting between father and son watching their respective plays might have not only heightened the climactic moment but also somewhat clarified it as well.  Yes, the scene of Lincoln leaving for Ford's Theater in the long walk away from us is poetic and immensely touching - but even in the brief scene at Lincoln's deathbed, things are so watered down that there is no real feel coming from those playing the parts of those involved in the historic moment.  Mary Todd was insane with grief - but not so in this last scene.  Stanton's ""Now he belongs to the angels"" (or ""ages"") is all but mumbled and lost on the viewers as to who is actually saying it.  These are not quibbles.  These are important movie-making matters that might have helped make LINCOLN the true and full epic it aspires to be.I didn't expect LINCOLN to be a History Channel docudrama. But to those uninitiated to all things Lincoln - and they exist in increasingly and alarmingly growing numbers! - viewing this film can too easily be more confusing than clarifying.  Granted that clarification is not a movie's prime purpose, but in this instance, dealing with our most important President, it surely would not have hurt. I'd hate to think that the youth of this country  might find much more interest and excitement in ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER than in LINCOLN.Those who argue that there is just way too much to Lincoln and the Civil War to cram into a 165 minute movie might want to take a look at 1988's TV movie LINCOLN based upon the book by Gore Vidal.  This film is only 23 minutes longer than Spielberg's, yet it covers Lincoln's entire presidency and is not only much more informative with regards to both Lincoln and the Civil War, but also better written and, yes, better acted than Spielberg's LINCOLN.  Long before contemporary discussions on the higher-pitched accuracy of Daniel Day-Lewis' vocal interpretation, we had Sam Waterston sounding probably even more like the actual Lincoln sounded.  And as much as I am in awe of Daniel Day-Lewis and think he is an absolutely incredible actor, there is somewhere in me that always knows he is acting - and not only here but in his other work as well.  Although Waterston is not tall enough for the boots of Honest Abe, there is in his performance something totally true and, yes, honest that effectively blurs the line between actor and actuality.  Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Todd Lincoln, again while not looking as much as the actual woman as does Sally Field, by far captures the real First Lady's character in incredible and immense ways.  In this TV movie, the relationship of the Lincolns is also detailed in a much more moving and effective manner.  Yes, the script gave the leads more to work with - but praise for the present shouldn't shadow the praiseworthy past.As a movie about the Thirteenth Amendment, Spielberg's LINCOLN mostly succeeds.  As a film dealing with  Lincoln, it is sadly lacking in scope, vision and full import.",3,LINCOLN is LACKING,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,6004,"['others', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'title', 'rather',

Mary's grief having affected her mental health but this also brings about what an articulate woman she was along with her desperation at carving out her place in her husbands life when he had this job that was so all consuming.  James Spader was remarkable and gave quite a hilarious bit of comedy relief. Tommy Lea Jones will mesmerize you every moment he is on the screen.  This is an heartrending and spectacular film.  In my view it should have won the Oscar for best picture of the year.  I rarely go to see movies anymore at all.  But I saw this one twice.  Perfect for your dvd collection.

1593389,A1DPP8TXDCHCDN,B009AMANBA,"R. L. Huff ""An old reader""","[0, 0]","This is an historic masterpiece, in both the literal and cinematic sense.  Its recreation of the period is impeccable; as well as its portrayal of Lincoln's political grit - his common, down-home talent for frontier mud-wrestling - in order to realize the loftiest of ideals.  I do agree that the film is overly-long.  Spielberg self-consciously created an epic, and succumbed to the tempation of padding to justify said status.  A half hour of extraneous material could have been cut leaving a tighter (and just as epic) story.In making the film palatable to a post-civil rights audience of the 21st century, portions of the story were rendered rather unbelievable, such as the opening straightforward dialogue between black troopers and their commander-in-chief.  Missing, too, was the full scope of intrigue behind the Emancipation: to ward off British recognition of the Confederacy, and revive the flagging Union war effort that seemed headed for an armistice.  Lincoln firmly believed that a no-nonsense military and political victory over the Confederacy was necessary to reweld the Union.  And yet, the Proclamation freed not a single slave, as he knew to be the case.  It did not apply to those slave states which had not seceded; nor could it apply to those in rebellion, until after their surrender.  Such is why the Emancipation is celebrated on ""Juneteenth,"" for June 19, 1865.This sequence is lost in this film, which prefers a straightforward moral narrative elevating Lincoln to the god-like stature of his Memorial, and us left to ponder the ultimate cosmic goodness of the American Vision.

I felt as though I had already seen the film before I paid for my popcorn. And the bar had been set extremely high.Don't get me wrong... ""Lincoln"" is very good. Based on Pulitzer Prize winner Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"", the performances are solid, especially those by Daniel Day-Lewis (another Oscar? You bet!), who manages to breathe believable life into a man previously best depicted in Brady ambrotypes and legend, and Tommy Lee Jones (at least a Best Supporting Actor nomination) as the fiery abolishionist Congressman Thaddeus Stevens. And Tony Kushner is sure to be rewarded for his wonderful screenplay.The story is both timely and compelling: how our iconic and most beloved President managed to ""convince"" a hostile House to adopt the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolishing slavery. However, it will be most appreciated by history buff-types (similarly to 2008's ""Frost/Nixon"") and less so by the casual moviegoer.During the theatrical matinee showing which I attended, 2 purse-toting teenage girls walked out precisely 1 hr. into the film (perhaps disappointed that the REAL President Lincoln wasn't an axe-wielding vampire hunter and hoping to slip into the latest installment of the ""Twilight"" saga a few screens down) and a middle-aged man several rows behind me snoozed loudly. Don't be surprised if your experience is similar. To some, it will be THAT kind of movie.My only real criticism is that the 2 1/2 hour film should have ended at 2 hrs. Everything that occured following the vote was really unneccessary and rushed. We all know the Civil War ends and Lincoln is assasinated. The first 2 hours cover the month of January, 1865 and the lobbying for votes, while February through April are needlessly crammed into the final 30 minutes.That being said, it's a great story and everyone should benefit from seeing it, if for no other reason than to understand the inner workings of 1860's American government and how it is relevent 150 years later.

Beschloss also ranks Lincoln's predecessor, William Buchanan, as the worst U.S. President and Lincoln, the movie, supplies ample evidence for that judgement too.The film clears up a great deal about Mary Todd Lincoln's role in establishing the tone for the modern White House.  At one point, Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) threatens to have Mrs. Lincoln investigated for what he thinks is her high spending.  She gives a sharp (and accurate) rebuttal - when the Lincolns moved in after the Buchanans, the White House was ""a pig sty"".  Mrs. Lincoln's spending after years of neglect finally made the place habitable.There are searing film sequences that explore other tensions between Mrs. Lincoln and the President, these mostly deal with the status of their son; Mrs. Lincoln literally begging the President to spare him from battle, and in one of their titanic fulminations, she queries the stars more than anything: ""How will we ever get through this?""  and Lincoln's simple logic is revealed.  ""Somehow"" he replies.  Working on passage of the 13th Amendment, Daniel Day Lewis gives Lincoln his defining quality - he can see through to the other side of an issue, while most of those around him are so consumed by petty bickering they can't imagine what a solution looks like.  There are places in the film where Daniel Day Lewis gives Lincoln a brutal bluntness to rally his supporters.Just when we think there can't be anything new about the Civil War, the film finds ways to shock us all over again.  For example, few would suspect that New York's House delegation  led the fight (aided and abetted by congressional leaders from Connecticut) to retain slavery!  The moment Tommy Lee Jones, as noted earlier playing Thaddeus Stevens, removes his wig and leaps into bed with his African American mistress has to be one of the most indelible moments in film history.A dense of doom and imperilment pervades the film, especially  in Lincoln's yellowish skin; even in direct sunlight he appears sallow and unhealthy - mercifully, the film does not give us the assassination, focusing instead on the reaction of others to the tragedy.

1593402,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B009AMANBA,Robin Friedman,"[6, 10]","On January 31, 1865, the House of Representatives passed the proposed Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution which outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude within the United States, except in punishment for a crime.  The Senate had passed the Amendment earlier, in April, 1864, and the Amendmenr became law upon ratification by the required number of states in December 1865.  President Lincoln, just beginning his second term, played a critical role in securing the House passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, both openly and behind the scenes.Steven Spielberg's new movie ""Lincoln"" covers the last four months of the president's life and focuses upon his activities in ending slavery through the Thirteenth Amendment. The movie is a historically-informed account,  It draws in part on Doris Stearns Goodwin's book ""Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln."" Several renowned Lincoln and Civil War scholars served as consultants to the film.The settings of the movie have a period feel, with much of the filming done in Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia. The performances bring to life their subjects, particularly that of Daniel Day-Lewis.  He captures Lincoln's high pitched verbal twang, his humor, political savvy, wisdom, and melancholy loneliness. Sally Fields gives an effective performance in the difficult role of Lincoln's complexly difficult wife, Mary Todd. The movie includes a large cast of historical personages, including Lincoln's cabinet, many members of the House and Senate, Confederate political leaders, Generals including Grant and Lee, Lincoln's sons, and Elizabeth Keckley, a former slave who became Mary Lincoln's dressmaker and friend.The movie interweaves the military and political events involved in the Thirteenth Amendment with Lincoln's personal life. It shows how consideration of the Amendment became tied to a peace conference between Lincoln and a Confederate delegation held at Hampton Roads late in the Civil War. As the movie develops, the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment required the votes of 20 Democrats in the House. Many in Lincoln's cabinet despaired of its passage and advised the president not to push the matter. But Lincoln pushed on.In many scenes of the movie, Lincoln speaks eloquently about the need for the Amendment and about its relationship to the Emancipation Proclamation which Lincoln had signed on January 1, 1863.  In addition to the scenes of idealism and commitment, the movie is about the rough and tumble business of American politics. Lincoln told his operatives to do what they needed to do to secure the votes, and they did. There are many scenes in the film of horse trading and chicanery. There are highly realistic and rancorous debate scenes involving many members on the floor of the House.Concluding portions of the movie touch briefly on Appatomatox and upon Lincoln's assassination.The movie is thoughtful and historically informed.  It held my attention throughout.The movie offers an inspiring portrayal of an American hero. It shows the combination of idealism and rawness in Lincoln and in the American political sytstem of his time. I hope this movie about Lincoln may help us  understand and appreciate our common past and prepare, with all our differences, to move forward.Robin Friedman",5,Spielberg's Lincoln,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,3297,"['January', '31', '1865', 'House', 'Representatives', 'passed', 'proposed', 'Thirteenth', 'Amendment', 'Constitution', 'outlawed', 'slavery', 'involuntary', 'servitude', 'United', 'States', 'punishment', 'crime', 'Senate', 'had', 'passed', 'Amendment', 'earlier', 'April', '1864', 'Amendmenr', 'became', 'law', 'ratification', 'required', 'number', 'states', 'December', '1865', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'just', 'beginning', 'second', 'term', 'played', 'critical', 'role', 'securing', 'House', 'passage', 'Thirteenth', 'Amendment', 'openly', 'scenes.Steven', 'Spielberg', 'new', 'movie', 'Lincoln', 'last', 'four', 'months', 'president', 'life', 'activities', 'ending', 'slavery', 'Thirteenth', 'Amendment', 'movie', 'historically-informed', 'account', 'part', 'Doris', 'Stearns', 'Goodwin', 'book', 'Team', 'Rivals', 'Political', 'Genius', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Several', 'renowned', 'Lincoln', 'Civil', 'War', 'served', 'consultants', 'film.The', 'settings', 'movie', 'have', 'period', 'feel', 'much', 'filming', 'done', 'Petersburg', 'Richmond', 'Virginia', 'performances', 'bring', 'life', 'subjects', 'particularly', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Lincoln', 'high', 'pitched', 'verbal', 'twang', 'humor', 'political', 'savvy', 'wisdom', 'melancholy', 'loneliness', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'effective', 'performance', 'difficult', 'role', 'Lincoln', 'complexly', 'difficult', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'movie', 'large', 'cast', 'historical', 'personages', 'including', 'Lincoln', 'cabinet', 'many', 'members', 'House', 'Senate', 'Confederate', 'political', 'leaders', 'Generals', 'including', 'Grant', 'Lee', 'Lincoln', 'sons', 'Elizabeth', 'Keckley', 'former', 'slave', 'who', 'became', 'Mary', 'Lincoln', 'dressmaker', 'friend.The', 'movie', 'military', 'political', 'events', 'involved', 'Thirteenth', 'Amendment', 'Lincoln', 'personal', 'life', 'how', 'consideration', 'Amendment', 'became', 'tied', 'peace', 'conference', 'Lincoln', 'Confederate', 'delegation', 'held', 'Hampton', 'Roads', 'late', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'enactment', 'Thirteenth', 'Amendment', 'required', 'votes', '20', 'Democrats', 'House', 'Many', 'Lincoln', 'cabinet', 'despaired', 'passage', 'advised', 'president', 'not', 'push', 'matter', 'Lincoln', 'pushed', 'on.In', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Lincoln', 'eloquently', 'need', 'Amendment', 'relationship', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'Lincoln', 'had', 'signed', 'January', '1', '1863', 'addition', 'scenes', 'idealism', 'commitment', 'movie', 'rough', 'tumble', 'business', 'American', 'politics', 'Lincoln', 'told', 'operatives', 'do', 'what', 'needed', 'do', 'secure', 'votes', 'did', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'film', 'horse', 'trading', 'chicanery', 'are', 'highly', 'realistic', 'rancorous', 'debate', 'scenes', 'involving', 'many', 'members', 'floor', 'House.Concluding', 'portions', 'movie', 'touch', 'briefly', 'Appatomatox', 'Lincoln', 'assassination.The', 'movie', 'thoughtful', 'historically', 'informed', 'held', 'attention', 'throughout.The', 'movie', 'inspiring', 'portrayal', 'American', 'hero', 'combination', 'idealism', 'rawness', 'Lincoln', 'American', 'political', 'sytstem', 'time', 'hope', 'movie', 'Lincoln', 'may', 'help', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'common', 'past', 'prepare', 'differences', 'move', 'forward.Robin', 'Friedman']",N/A

1593406,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B009AMANBA,Roger J. Buffington,"[0, 0]","&#34;Lincoln&#34; really should have born a different title such as &#34;Ending Slavery&#34; or somesuch, because what this film is really about is Abraham Lincoln's courageous decision to push for the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which of course outlaws slavery. This was undoubtedly one of Lincoln's great achievements and is the worthy subject of a fine film such as this one. Just understand that this film is about only a very narrow period of time in Lincoln's life, or even his presidency, and in fact takes place after victory in the Civil War is in sight.This film does an excellent job reminding the viewer that the decision to outlaw slavery by amending the Constitution was by no means an easy, or even popular, position for President Lincoln to take. In fact it required him to use every bit of his political capital and involved the risk of a resounding defeat to a President that had already suffered many defeats. In this period slavery had been a terrible fact of American life for a very long time and many of Lincoln's Civil War allies were adamant that the war was about preserving the Union, not about abolishing slavery. But as Lincoln had done many times before, he led the country in to doing what it had to do. This film makes this point very well.The acting in this film is uniformly good and this film is up to the usually high standards that Steven Spielberg usually attains in his films. Perhaps another film another time can deal with the broader subject of Lincoln's entire life and Presidency. In an understated way this film succeeds in reminding all of us that Lincoln was in fact a giant of his time and is well-deserving of his reputation as ranking with Washington as our greatest of presidents.

1593407,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B009AMANBA,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","For his biopic ""Lincoln,"" rather than try to cram a man's entire life into a two-and-a-half-hour running time, Steven Spielberg has wisely chosen to keep the focus circumscribed and narrow: on the winter of 1865, four years into the Civil War, as the President works to secure passage of the highly controversial 13th Amendment, which, when ratified, will abolish slavery as an institution in the United States for all time to come. Lincoln's main hope is to convince a skeptical and still highly racist public that such a move is essential to bringing an end to a war that has already claimed 600,000 of their young men's lives. The obstacles that remain are the Democrats in Congress who are universally opposed to such a move and many Republicans who think this constitutional amendment may well pave the way to universal suffrage, with not just blacks but women ultimately being given the right to vote. Lincoln's major hope is to convince a sufficient number of lame duck Democrats to come over to his side, while not allowing the amendment's passage to throw a monkey wrench into any possibility of surrender on the part of the Confederacy.A man of both faith and reason, pragmatism and passion, Lincoln knew that he stood on the threshold of history, that he needed to act decisively and at that very moment to wipe out the scourge of slavery that, since the young nation's inception, had brought shame and evil to a republic ostensibly founded on the concept that all men are created equal.The movie beautifully captures Lincoln as a man bowed down by the burden of his position and the times in which he not only lived but played so vital a role in shaping, a brilliant but self-effacing man, keenly cognizant of his humble beginnings, as ready to lend an ear to the lowliest foot soldier or telegraph operator as to the greatest general or politician - indeed more eager in some cases, for he knew that the common man often had more honesty in his answer and wisdom in his soul than the great one. .This is the man whom screenwriter Tony Kushner and author Doris Kearns Goodwin, upon whose book ""Team of Rivals"" the movie is based, present to the audience.But that isn't all. The movie also functions as both a fascinating look into the events of the time and as an illustration of how even the noblest advances in human history have often arisen out of a messy combination of moral compromise and shady back-room deal-making. The most obvious embodiment of that is Thaddeus Stephens (played with solid conviction and a sly self-awareness by Tommy Lee Jones), a Republican Congressman who has to weigh his strong abolitionist views against the pragmatic need to get things right.The script encompasses Lincoln's domestic circle as well, as it explores the complex relationship between Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd (Sally Field), a brutally frank, sharp-tongued woman frequently brought low by debilitating migraines and steeped in grief over the loss of their young son, Todd, a few years back.We also see the effect of all this on the Lincolns' oldest son, Robert (Joseph Gordon- Levitt), who is forced to live in the shadow of a great man, convinced he will never be able to live at peace with himself unless he is allowed to fight alongside all the other boys of his age on the field of battle.A host of familiar faces - David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Walter Goggins, James Spader, S. Epatha Merkerson, among them - flesh out the canvas. And what a glorious canvas it turns out to be, thanks to meticulous set decoration and costume design as well as cinematography by the great Janusz Kaminski that filters the action through duskily-lit interiors and near-sepia-toned exteriors.Of course, ""Lincoln"" would not be the triumph it is without the exemplary performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, who manages to turn a towering figure of history into a recognizable human being. Stoop-shouldered and slow of speech and movement, Lewis conveys the quiet gravity that allows us to understand just how this one man could command the respect of so many of the people of his time and, in so doing, move mountains.All involved have made ""Lincoln"" a portrait worthy of its subject.",5,A great historical film,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,4181,"['biopic', 'Lincoln', 'rather', 'try', 'cram', 'man', 'entire', 'life', 'two-and-a-half-hour', 'running', 'time', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'wisely', 'chosen', 'keep', 'focus', 'circumscribed', 'narrow', 'winter', '1865', 'four', 'years', 'Civil', 'War', 'President', 'secure', 'passage', 'highly', 'controversial', '13th', 'Amendment', 'when', 'ratified', 'will', 'abolish', 'slavery', 'institution', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'come', 'Lincoln', 'main', 'hope', 'convince', 'skeptical', 'still', 'highly', 'racist', 'public', 'move', 'essential', 'bringing', 'end', 'war', 'already', 'claimed', '600,000', 'young', 'men', 'lives', 'obstacles', 'remain', 'are', 'Democrats', 'Congress', 'who', 'are', 'universally', 'opposed', 'move', 'many', 'Republicans', 'who', 'think', 'constitutional', 'amendment', 'may', 'well', 'pave', 'way', 'universal', 'suffrage', 'not', 'just', 'blacks', 'women', 'ultimately', 'being', 'given', 'right', 'vote', 'Lincoln', 'major', 'hope', 'convince', 'sufficient', 'number', 'lame', 'duck', 'Democrats', 'come', 'side', 'not', 'allowing', 'amendment', 'passage', 'throw', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'possibility', 'surrender', 'part', 'Confederacy.A', 'man', 'faith', 'reason', 'pragmatism', 'passion', 'Lincoln', 'knew', 'stood', 'threshold', 'history', 'needed', 'act', 'decisively', 'very', 'moment', 'wipe', 'out', 'scourge', 'slavery', 'young', 'nation', 'inception', 'had', 'brought', 'shame', 'evil', 'republic', 'ostensibly', 'founded', 'concept', 'men', 'are', 'created', 'equal.The', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'Lincoln', 'man', 'bowed', 'down', 'burden', 'position', 'times', 'not', 'only', 'lived', 'played', 'so', 'vital', 'role', 'shaping', 'brilliant', 'self-effacing', 'man', 'keenly', 'cognizant', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'ready', 'lend', 'ear', 'lowliest', 'foot', 'soldier', 'telegraph', 'operator', 'greatest', 'general', 'politician', 'indeed', 'more', 'eager', 'cases', 'knew', 'common', 'man', 'often', 'had', 'more', 'honesty', 'answer', 'wisdom', 'soul', 'great', 'one', '.This', 'man', 'whom', 'screenwriter', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'author', 'Doris', 'Kearns', 'Goodwin', 'book', 'Team', 'Rivals', 'movie', 'based', 'present', 'audience.But', ""n't"", 'movie', 'also', 'functions', 'fascinating', 'look', 'events', 'time', 'illustration', 'how', 'even', 'noblest', 'advances', 'human', 'history', 'have', 'often', 'arisen', 'messy', 'combination', 'moral', 'compromise', 'shady', 'back-room', 'deal-making', 'most', 'obvious', 'embodiment', 'Thaddeus', 'Stephens', 'played', 'solid', 'conviction', 'sly', 'self-awareness', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Republican', 'Congressman', 'who', 'weigh', 'strong', 'abolitionist', 'views', 'pragmatic', 'need', 'get', 'things', 'right.The', 'script', 'Lincoln', 'domestic', 'circle', 'as', 'well', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Lincoln', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Sally', 'Field', 'brutally', 'frank', 'sharp-tongued', 'woman', 'frequently', 'brought', 'low', 'debilitating', 'migraines', 'steeped', 'grief', 'loss', 'young', 'son', 'Todd', 'few', 'years', 'back.We', 'also', 'see', 'effect', 'Lincolns', 'oldest', 'son', 'Robert', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-', 'Levitt', 'who', 'forced', 'live', 'shadow', 'great', 'man', 'convinced', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'peace', 'allowed', 'fight', 'alongside', 'other', 'boys', 'age', 'field', 'battle.A', 'host', 'familiar', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Walter', 'Goggins', 'James', 'Spader', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'flesh', 'canvas', 'what', 'glorious', 'canvas', 'out', 'be', 'thanks', 'meticulous', 'set', 'decoration', 'costume', 'design', 'as', 'well', 'cinematography', 'great', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'action', 'duskily-lit', 'interiors', 'near-sepia-toned', 'exteriors.Of', 'course', 'Lincoln', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'triumph', 'exemplary', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'who', 'turn', 'towering', 'figure', 'history', 'recognizable', 'human', 'being', 'Stoop-shouldered', 'slow', 'speech', 'movement', 'Lewis', 'quiet', 'gravity', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'could', 'command', 'respect', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'time', 'so', 'doing', 'move', 'mountains.All', 'involved', 'have', 'made', 'Lincoln', 'portrait', 'worthy', 'subject']",N/A

I am sure this is probably how the south still felt however with the lost of what they considered their property. The movie ends with Lincolns death on April 15.

The movie stays true to its title and focuses on the hard choices and the battles in Washington that Lincoln had to face.

Some parts were difficult to follow for my girlfriend who watched it with me who is not as knowledgeable about the history of the Civil War.

Obviously, this film interested me because I frequently heard about the significance of Lincoln's legacy all throughout my middle school and high school years. Additionally, I had the chance to previously garner more information about Lincoln from the following circumstances: a Gettysburg Museum visit while I was still in the military, fascinating details included about him from the book ""One Nation Under Sex"" (by  David Eisenbach PhD and Larry Flynt), and further  details from both a paper that I wrote and a class that I took less than 11 months ago. Daniel Day Lewis naturally channels the legacy of Lincoln in a dignified manner.  It is hard for me to choose from the best in this film because many of the actors and actresses poured their souls into their acting parts. However, I would have to admit that I also liked Tommy Lee Jones (Men In Black films) commanding portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens and James Spader's (Stargate,The Office) amusing depiction of William Bilbo.  Lee carefully plays a character who is ahead of their time with the projected emotional strength in standing for equality. Meanwhile, Spader plays both a serious and comical projection of someone who was part of the foundation implementing Lincoln's  plans.

1593491,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B009AMANBA,Steven Aldersley,"[7, 13]","I knew that I would have to see Lincoln because it stars Daniel Day-Lewis, but I was wary of the subject matter. Most historical epics leave me cold, and I find that I have little interest in politics of any kind. The prospect of watching two-and-a-half hours of (mostly) men dressed in 1860s garb, and depictions of the Civil War, did not exactly appeal. I had similar misgivings about The Iron Lady (a far inferior film), but wanted to watch the best actress of her generation, Meryl Streep.Fortunately for me, with the exception of the opening battle scene, Spielberg chose to do something rather different.I remember a conversation with Quentin Tarantino, in which he was asked the question whether he would ever direct the biography of someone like Elvis Presley. Tarantino replied that he couldn't imagine covering Presley's whole life, but it might be interesting to write a story depicting the day he signed with Sun Records. Spielberg has chosen a similar strategy for Lincoln. Instead of being shown Lincoln's entire life, Spielberg focuses on the vote to pass the Thirteenth Amendment, to abolish slavery.This sharp focus worked well in another political drama, Frost/Nixon, in which David Frost tries to extract an apology from Nixon for the crimes he committed while in power.Lincoln believes in the Thirteenth Amendment, and that the Civil War might be ended if he can get the bill passed. The film shows the methods Lincoln and his subordinates use to secure the required number of votes. He calculates that, in addition to the Republican votes, he will need 20 from other sources. We see what motivates some of the men who might be persuaded to vote in favor of the bill.On a deeper level, the film is inevitably a character study. We see how Lincoln listens to men from every walk of life and makes them feel valued. He earns their respect, loyalty, and even their love. On a more personal level, he has problems within his own family. Lincoln has to face his wife, Mary (Sally Field), as she questions some of his actions. One of the biggest dilemmas is whether Lincoln should allow his son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), to fight in the Civil War.Other key characters include Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), who has motivations of his own regarding the bill, and William Seward (David Strathairn), Lincoln's Secretary of State.This is an all-star cast, and the acting is superb across the board. Day-Lewis is arguably the finest male actor of the current century, and this performance only adds to his legend. As always, he inhabits the character, never sounding just like himself. Compare this latest performance to his Oscar-winning role in There Will Be Blood, and you'll see what I mean. Lincoln speaks softly for the most part, but he captivates his audience. He tells a number of amusing anecdotes and the audience in my theater loved most of them.Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones could also receive nominations in the supporting categories. If you remove those three actors, the cast would still be stronger than that seen in most movies.While Lincoln isn't the ideal type of film for me, I respect what it achieves. The technical work matches the excellent acting. If I had a greater interest in history, or politics, I would probably have liked Lincoln even more. I could imagine American audiences being fascinated by the subject. This will be one of the leading contenders for Oscar nominations.Possible glitch in the matrix: D-Day from Animal House (McGill) appears alongside D.

1593494,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B009AMANBA,Steven Hancock,"[5, 7]","When I first heard several years ago that Steven Spielberg planned to do a movie about Abraham Lincoln, I got very excited. One of the greatest film directors of our time tackling a story of one of the greatest Presidents in American history is just exciting to think about. Say what you will about Spielberg's political beliefs, but his historical films, from Shindler's List to Saving Private Ryan, are some of the best in the genre. Now, over a decade after his decision to do a film about the Great Emancipator, Spielberg's Lincoln finally hit the cinemas nationwide this past Friday. This has certainly become one of the more scrutinized films by historians and modern filmmakers. So, here I am to give my thoughts on this remarkable film.For this film, Spielberg has assembled one of the greatest all-star casts ever assembled. But this movie truly belongs to it's leading man: Daniel Day-Lewis. As I expected before seeing the film, Mr. Day-Lewis gives us what will surely be the definitive screen depiction of our 16th President. As the man has a penchant for doing, he delves into the role with a passion never seen by any actor who has donned the top hat. He truly shows the torment of the man who was overseeing the bloodiest war in American history, while also dealing with a wife whom he loves, though she does drive him angry at times, and the loss of his son Willie years ago. But he also shows Lincoln was a fiercely political animal, as he works to get the necessary votes needed to pass the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery, and with bringing an end to the war. But most of all, Lincoln shows the humorous nature of the man, telling yarns and jokes to help get his points across. In all three areas, Day-Lewis excels. If he doesn't at least get a nomination come Oscar time, then something is definitely wrong with affairs in Hollywood.Another actor who should be considered for an Oscar is Tommy Lee Jones, who portrays Thaddeus Stevens, a member of the Radical Republicans, and a strong voice for abolition in the U.S. House of Representatives. As usual, Jones gives a strong, humorous performance as a man who is not above insulting his Democratic rivals in the House to bring his point across to the people. He also shows that, despite taking a strong stance against slavery, he is willing to calm his rhetoric to get the amendment passed. This is definitely some of Mr. Jones' finest work, and deserves some recognition come Oscar time.Sally Field portrays Mary Todd Lincoln. I have to admit, I was slightly disappointed by Ms. Field in the role. She wasn't bad. She just wasn't as good as I thought she'd be. But she does manage to get some laughs, as well as some emotional intensity. It is possible that, had she had more screen time, her performance would have been more fleshed out. But still, she does a solid job in the role.There are several notable minor roles that should be mentioned. James Spader as W.N. Bilbo, one of the three men hired by the Lincoln administration to ""bribe"" several key Democrats to vote in favor of the amendment. He is a very funny character, and Spader does good in the role. Also turning in fine performances are Lee Pace as Fernando Wood, a Democrat who stands against Emancipation; Hal Holbrook as Francis Preston Blair, the Postmaster General who calls for Lincoln to attempt to bring the war to a peaceful end; David Strathairn as William Seward, Secretary of State, and Lincoln's closest friend in the cabinet; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Todd Lincoln, the President's oldest son, and a man who wants more than anything to do his part by joining the army, and; Jared Harris as Ulysses S. Grant. Although a very bit role, his performance comes off as very authentic, and he really gives you a good impression of what Grant was like in his short time in the role. The rest of the supporting cast truly does a commendable job in bringing this story to life.Tony Kushner's script covers a very short amount of time in Lincoln's life, from January to April of 1865, the closing months of the war. But in choosing to focus on this short amount of time, we get to see two of the most important moments in American history: the final abolition of slavery, and the ending of the American Civil War. Here, we get to see Lincoln as a husband, a father, a politician, and as a human being, and how his involvement in affairs brought about great changes in our country. The script also provides Spielberg with his most character-driven piece to date. While the script does occasionally drag in places, it provides a thorough and emotional look at the events depicted in this film.To me, there were only three weaknesses in the film. First and second, as already mentioned, are Sally Field's slightly disappointing turn as Mary Todd Lincoln, and the tendency of the film to drag at times. But these are not a major problems with the film. The third weakness is in the choice of actor to portray Robert E. Lee in the brief depiction of the surrender at Appomattox. While the scene itself is depicted fairly accurately, the fact that they chose to cast a man who, although he looks like Lee in the face, is rather chunky to play the frail, skinny commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, is somewhat distracting from the emotional impact of the scene. But again, this is a minor quibble in an overall moving film.Lincoln is definitely one of the greatest films made about Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War. From the amazing performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and an all-star cast, a powerfully-written script, to a moving finale, this is definitely the defining portrait of the man considered by many to be our Greatest President. If you have an interest in American history, or enjoy serious, thought-provoking drama, then Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is definitely a movie worth seeing.Grade: A-",5,"""We are stepped out upon the

Even nature calling me to visit the rest room had to wait. It was Daniel Day Lewis's presence, Tony Kushner's words and , Steven Spielberg's direction that kept me there for nearly 2  hours. This film is - in my opinion - a masterpiece and, like Spielberg's earlier film ""Schindler's List"", this film will serve for years (even generations) in teaching student about an important moment in history.  But there are already 155 reviews of the film posted here (and I don't want to repeat what others have said.) I'll concentrate on the DVD and Bluray releases of the film.Amazon has a general policy of grouping ALL the reviews of a film together and displaying them under all the formats. Reviews start when a fil plays in theaters and then often goes to the Amazon Instant (streaming version).  So I often recommend - when posting my reviews - that you sort by ""most recent"" first and then look to see which version the reviewer is discussing. This is a review of the 4-disc Blu-ray+ DVD+Digital Copy, but it should guide you in your purchase, I hope.Disney (the distributor of the home video) is issuing it in three different ""formats"".  The single DVD contains the film and 9-minute ""featurette"" titled ""The Journey to Lincoln"" with the major ""players"".  The 2-Disc Blueray+DVD just adds another (4-minute) featurette - this one on how they filmed in Richmond Virginia. The only advantage to this version is that you will get higher resolution image.  The FOUR-disc version adds a digital copy but - more importantly - adds a ""Bonus Disc) with four more featurettes which add still another 53 minutes of background to the film. The longest (at 27 minutes) is ""Living With Lincoln"" where we follow the filming from beginning to end with interviews from every one of the major actors plus the producer and Spielberg. ""Crafting The Past"" (10 minutes) covers production design and makeup) while ""In Lincoln's Footsteps"" (!6 minutes) all too-briefly covers the score but have a great section on how the sound designer located just the right pocket watch to record for the sound of the ticking in the film (I won't spoil the surprise by revealing the answer.

It's about the battle to pass the 13th Amendment and end the Civil War. Lincoln is just one of the players in that drama.I was told this wasn't a political movie. Not a political movie? That's EXACTLY what this is. It's about the politics then and politics now. If you'd rather avoid that, avoid this. It's revisionist history at its worst.The outdoor settings are LOVELY.

Day-Lewis does an awesome job of becoming Lincoln, but the lines and direction he was given is not a reflection of first-hand sources. If the main character is distorted, can the movie have much meaning? I mean Attorney Samuel C.

He was not only morally honest but intellectually so - he could not reason falsely - if he attempted it he failed.""

He never dealt in double meanings or used language for the purpose of concealing his opinions"" yet this movie depicts Lincoln as duplicitous, scheming, and conniving. I am frankly offended by that.The worst offense, however, is that the movie is just boring. It's two and half hours of blah, blah, blah.

1593512,A2I2A7N3OCPNW4,B009AMANBA,"T. A. Daniel ""Alex""","[0, 1]","LINCOLN starts off like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN: people fighting and dying for war. In Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the scale of D-Day was astonishing and gruesome. This memorable first scene sets the tone throughout the entire movie -- even if characters make jokes an hour into the movie, it was hard to fully remove yourself from how truly awful war was. While LINCOLN's first scene doesn't hold nearly the same grand scale that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's did, it serves the same function. We're made to look upon brothers fighting in the rain, in the mud, with their bare hands if they had to. It's a short scene, but the rest of the movie is haunted by the thought of these men -- all around the country -- fighting and dying for what's going on in Washington DC.It's often hard for big studio pictures to equal the sum of its parts -- not so for 2012's LINCOLN. On the outset, I was super excited for this movie: it's got one of the best living directors heading it (Steven Spielberg) with one of the best living actors leading it (Daniel Day Lewis) about one of the most significant moments in American (and human) history (the ratification of the 13th amendment) from the perspective of one of America's most beloved presidents (Abraham Lincoln). But wait! There's more: a DP that can make anything look cinematic and beautiful (Janusz Kaminski) and a cast of some of the best actors in supporting roles (Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Lee Pace, John Hawkes, James Spader, Walton Goggins, Jackie Earle Haley, Michael Stuhlbarg, and plenty of others). It seems that a movie like LINCOLN would never be able to live up to its pedigree -- but it does. LINCOLN is one of the best movies of 2012, and I can't think of anyone I wouldn't recommend this movie to.First, I'd like to clarify that this movie is not a biopic in the traditional sense -- it's not a movie about the life of Abraham Lincoln. LINCOLN is about Abraham Lincoln's attempt to ratify the (then controversial) 13th amendment to the United States Constitution. If you're not familiar with the story already, the 13th amendment clarified that equal rights ought to be provided for all people, of all creed and race. In today's time, this sensibility seems like nothing special, but in the 19th century, it divided the nation. Getting congress to ratify any amendment can be an arduous process, but Lincoln was up against near-insurmountable odds: he faced a split (and nearly hostile) congress and a strict time line (he wanted to pass it before his re-inauguration after his re-election). Oh, and let's not forget that the entire country was at war with itself in the bloody and brutal Civil War. This is what the movie is about: we pick up in the middle of the civil war, just after President Lincoln's re-election, and the movie ends just short of the amendment's ratification.The film is based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book TEAM OF RIVALS. Spielberg and (screenwriter) Tony Kushner do well to shrink the scope of their story. Rather than trying to cover every element of Abraham Lincoln's life, they focus in on one of the most pivotal moments of his life and of American history. Working on this smaller scale, Spielberg is able to capture the drama of it all -- there are clear story arcs at work here. LINCOLN is excellently paced with plenty of moments of drama, suspense, and even comedy. The movie never for a moment feels like a history lesson. The political maneuverings are fun to watch and, even if you know the story, feel cinematic. Spielberg never gets jingoistic about America either -- there's a sense of patriotism here, but it's earned by watching the characters on screen fighting for human rights, rather than hollow platitudes.There's considerable buzz that Daniel Day Lewis is a shoe-in for the Best Actor Oscar, and the hype is warranted. Lewis is good in pretty much everything he does, but he genuinely disappears as Lincoln. While watching the movie, I would forget that the character on screen wasn't the actual Abraham Lincoln. He comes across as stern, stoic, and infinitely wise. Through the movie, it appears to be a defeated man, but he is still able to find the beauty in moments with his young son, or camaraderie with his staff with a few jokes. I wouldn't say that Lewis steals the show though (as he did in THERE WILL BE BLOOD) -- the rest of the cast is phenomenal. Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens (the staunch, idealistic congressman) is excellent; James Spader as W.N. Bilbo (as hired gun sent out to obtain votes from on-the-fence congressmen) is hilarious; Michael Stuhlbarg as George Yeaman (the nervous, on-the-fence Democrat) is great. I really could go on -- the acting is superb.LINCOLN is one of the best movies I've seen in 2012. While there is a bit of foul language (and violence in the first scene), I would recommend this movie highly to anyone interested in it.",5,Highly Recommended for Pretty Much Anyone,1355961600,"12 20,

I didn't know much about Lincoln, but I couldn't put the book down; I read it for about 6 hours a day. The book had so much more cinema in it than this film did.Daniel Day Lewis nailed Lincoln and deserves all the accolades, but in focusing solely on the passage of the amendment freeing the slaves, Spielberg missed an awful lot of great stuff which would have made this movie a lot more riveting. And by incorrectly including Connecticut legislators in the ""nay"" column, he also managed to insult an awful lot of people from Connecticut.I know that people always say the book was better and that no movie can capture a book's depth, but he left out scenes of Mr. and Ms. Lincoln traveling through Washington DC at night surrounded by wounded soldiers and the horror of war; a scene of Seward recovering from his wounds from the triple assassination attempt and noticing that flags were at half-mast - that's when he realized the President had been killed (no one would tell him); scenes of Lincoln's new cabinet deriding him behind his back, though they later loved him like a brother; and even scenes of Lincoln going out to hang with his cabinet just to get away from his wife.I am in the minority about this, but I think Spielberg movies lack depth, and that's certainly true with this film.

Stephens,James Spader as a verminous lobbyist.Strathairn is superb.Lincoln walks off into history espied by a black staffer.The clich&eacute;s of `honest Abe'' are avoided in a very good biopic.",4,In Euclid we trust,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,3069,"['Lincoln', 'Republican', 'president', 'peak', 'powers', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'pass', '13th', 'Amendment', 'Constitution', 'House', 'Representatives', 'abolish', 'slavery.Speilberg', 'covered', '80', 'pages', '500', 'page', 'script', 'Tony', 'Kuchner', 'episode', 'Goodwin', 'Team', 'Rivals', 'Political', 'Genius', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'dying', 'days', 'Civil', 'War.The', 'president', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'quoted', 'back', 'end', 'Gettysburg', 'Address', 'feisty', 'black', 'soldier', 'setting', 'up', 'framework', 'establishment', 'racial', 'equality.The', 'film', 'replete', 'muted', 'interiors', 'dark', 'colours', 'Speilberg', 'cinematographer', 'Kaminski.Lincoln', 'often', 'shot', 'shadow', 'silhouette.The', 'streets', 'yards', 'capital', 'Petersburg', 'are', 'grey', 'dirty', 'desolate.This', 'forms', 'part', 'trilogy', 'films', 'Color', 'Purple', 'Amistad', 'black', 'experience', 'America.Republicans', 'were', 'then', 'progressive', 'party', 'Democrats', 'believed', 'negroes', 'inferior', 'white', 'race', 'abolition', 'will', 'prolong', 'war.The', 'Republicans', 'urge', 'passing', 'amendment', 'war', 'readmission', 'Southern', 'States', 'Union', 'block', 'abolition', 'radical', 'Republicans', 'led', 'outspoken', 'abolitionist', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'will', 'seek', 'immediate', 'black', 'enfranchisement.Day', 'Lewis', 'skin', 'character', 'breathing', 'life', 'sculpted', 'monument', 'deflating', 'pomposity', 'jokes', 'stories', 'telling', 'anecdotes', 'pitching', 'voice', 'upper', 'register', 'cutting', 'short', 'speeches.His', 'public', 'life', 'balanced', 'tempestuous', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Field', 'eldest', 'son', 'Robert', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'decision', 'enlist', 'mortifies', 'mother.Lincoln', 'wholehearted', 'support', 'cabinet', 'especially', 'William', 'H.Seward', 'secretary', 'state', 'Strathairn', 'who', 'dirty', 'work', 'lobbyists', 'Spader', 'Hawkes', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'who', 'use', 'patronage', 'cash', 'gifts', 'buy', '20', 'votes', 'needed.Lincoln', 'persuades', 'Stevens', 'not', 'go', 'black', 'enfranchisement', 'north', 'swamp.He', 'leans', 'others', 'who', 'despise', 'slavery', 'are', 'frightened', 'freed', 'slaves.Lincoln', 'knew', 'abolition', 'must', 'precede', 'end', 'war.Day', 'Lewis', 'canny', 'dissembler', 'principle', 'cause', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'boy', 'bed', 'strikes', 'eldest', 'boy', 'face', 'blurting', 'father', 'mother.He', 'loving', 'wife', 'can', 'make', 'life', 'hell.But', 'patience', 'tested', 'grief', '3rd', 'son', 'Willie.Day', 'Lewis', 'portrayal', 'stooping', 'grizzled', 'bowed', 'sunken', 'deathly.Lee', 'Jones', 'acerbic', 'Stevens', 'able', 'terrify', 'subordinates', 'mock', 'wordy.Lincoln', 'seen', 'backroom', 'deals', 'hiding', 'out', 'halos', 'history', 'playing', 'withhis', 'son', 'Tad.There', 'are', 'excellent', 'cameo', 'roles', 'character', 'actors', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'Fernando', 'Wood', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'VP', 'Alexander', 'H.', 'Stephens', 'James', 'Spader', 'verminous', 'lobbyist.Strathairn', 'superb.Lincoln', 'walks', 'history', 'espied', 'black', 'staffer.The', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'honest', 'Abe', 'are', 'avoided', 'very', 'good', 'biopic']",N/A

That is not as compelling or interesting of a story.  Do you really want to watch a 2 and a half hour production of politicians fighting and making backroom deals?  Of course you do not.  That is why this film is a bore.Yes, the actors are great.  The screenplay is well written.  That is not the problem.  The problem is that the story is about a much less interesting topic.President Lincoln is a very interesting person.  He was not always so gung ho about ending slavery.  It was not until later on in his life that he felt strongly against slavery.  What caused this president to change his mind?  Too bad for you.  That is not the story being told in this film.What this tells me is that you cannot make a good film about Lincoln.  I think a miniseries would be a better option.

1593530,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B009AMANBA,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[4, 6]","""Lincoln,"" directed by Steven Spielberg and starring a mesmerizing Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role, covers the last four months of Lincoln's life, a time when he was trying to persuade the House of Representatives to vote for the 13th amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery.It is no easy task. The Civil War is in its final days and Lincoln, who has assumed considerable wartime powers, is unsure whether his 1863 executive order known as the Emancipation Proclamation will hold up legally once the war is over. The movie primarily deals with the efforts of Lincoln to secure the House votes necessary for passage.These efforts range from promising government jobs in exchange for votes, cajoling reluctant representatives and lecturing others, relying upon his cabinet, particularly Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn), to monitor the ever-changing climate in the House, and hiring the aggressive W.N. Bilbo (James Spader) to use his sometimes questionable methods to round up votes.In addition to this protracted political fight, there's turmoil in Lincoln's private life.  He and wife Mary Todd (Sally Field) lost a son two years earlier and the emotional toll still lingers.  Eldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is eager to join the Union Army but his parents are dead set against it, fearing he will be yet another casualty of war.  Lincoln understands the young man's patriotic impulse and must deal with his adamant wife about letting Robert enlist.""Lincoln"" is a long picture with a minimum of action. A brief scene of battle early on gives way to the drama of men making deals, speculating on how the country will fare once the war ends, and posturing on the floor of the House.  Through all of this, Lincoln remains calm and focused and determined that the amendment will be passed.  Mr. Day-Lewis' Lincoln is very human -- a simple man in an extraordinary position who understands the delicate balance of playing politics, sees issues from multiple perspectives, and favors amusing, earthy anecdotes.  Not impulsive, he  charts a carefully thought-out path to his goal.Mr. Day-Lewis is easily the movie's best attribute.  As the 16th President, he imbues Lincoln with stature, humor, leadership, and determination. The make-up helps to make his transformation into Lincoln believable. If you look at those famous Matthew Brady portraits, you will marvel at the similarity. The real Lincoln was more gaunt and looked far more careworn, but Day-Lewis makes up for the physical shortcoming with a powerful portrayal of a man under pressure from his political opponents, uncertainty about what will happen when the war over, and an outspoken wife protective of her surviving children.Sally Field is the real surprise in ""Lincoln.""  Ms. Field, who gained 20 pounds for the role of Mary, is equal to her screen husband in power. She is physically tiny, particularly in contrast to Day-Lewis' six-foot plus frame, yet she dominates the screen in every scene she's in. Hardly a shrinking violet, she speaks her mind to all, friends and foes alike. At a White House function, for instance, she is quick to tell it like it is to Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), a man with a history of criticizing the President.  Ms. Field's is a well-tempered performance, and she manages to make the big, fancy period gowns and hats look right at home on her tiny frame.Other performances of merit include Jackie Earle Haley's as Vice President of the Confederacy Alexander Stephens, Bruce McGill's as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Hal Holbrook's as political wheeler-dealer Preston Blair, and Jared Harris as Ulysses S. Grant.Rated PG-13, ""Lincoln"" is the kind of picture that attracts critical praise and Oscar nominations but may not prove to be a blockbuster.  Perhaps in deference to its subject matter, the tone is somber, Spielberg's specialty -- action -- is minimal, and the reliance on dialogue often gives the impression of a filmed stage play rather than a truly cinematic effort.Bonus extras on the four-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a digital copy and featurettes on the making of the film, Daniel Day-Lewis' characterization, the film's methodical production design, and the relevance of Lincoln to modern times.",4,Lincoln as Savvy Politician,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,4261,"['Lincoln', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'starring', 'mesmerizing', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'title', 'role', 'last', 'four', 'months', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'persuade', 'House', 'Representatives', 'vote', '13th', 'amendment', 'Constitution', 'abolishing', 'slavery.It', 'easy', 'task', 'Civil', 'War', 'final', 'days', 'Lincoln', 'who', 'assumed', 'considerable', 'wartime', 'powers', 'unsure', '1863', 'executive', 'order', 'known', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'legally', 'once', 'war', 'movie', 'primarily', 'efforts', 'Lincoln', 'secure', 'House', 'necessary', 'passage.These', 'efforts', 'range', 'promising', 'government', 'jobs', 'exchange', 'votes', 'cajoling', 'reluctant', 'representatives', 'lecturing', 'others', 'relying', 'cabinet', 'particularly', 'Secretary', 'State', 'William', 'Seward', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'monitor', 'ever-changing', 'climate', 'House', 'hiring', 'aggressive', 'W.N', 'Bilbo', 'James', 'Spader', 'use', 'sometimes', 'questionable', 'methods', 'round', 'up', 'votes.In', 'addition', 'protracted', 'political', 'fight', 'turmoil', 'Lincoln', 'private', 'life', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Sally', 'Field', 'lost', 'son', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'emotional', 'toll', 'still', 'Eldest', 'son', 'Robert', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'eager', 'join', 'Union', 'Army', 'parents', 'are', 'dead', 'set', 'fearing', 'will', 'be', 'yet', 'casualty', 'war', 'Lincoln', 'young', 'man', 'patriotic', 'impulse', 'must', 'deal', 'adamant', 'wife', 'letting', 'Robert', 'enlist', 'Lincoln', 'long', 'picture', 'minimum', 'action', 'brief', 'scene', 'battle', 'early', 'way', 'drama', 'men', 'making', 'deals', 'speculating', 'how', 'country', 'will', 'fare', 'once', 'war', 'posturing', 'floor', 'House', 'Lincoln', 'calm', 'focused', 'determined', 'amendment', 'will', 'be', 'passed', 'Mr.', 'Day-Lewis', 'Lincoln', 'very', 'human', 'simple', 'man', 'extraordinary', 'position', 'who', 'delicate', 'balance', 'playing', 'politics', 'sees', 'issues', 'multiple', 'perspectives', 'favors', 'amusing', 'earthy', 'anecdotes', 'Not', 'impulsive', 'carefully', 'thought-out', 'path', 'goal.Mr', 'Day-Lewis', 'easily', 'movie', 'best', 'attribute', '16th', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'stature', 'humor', 'leadership', 'determination', 'make-up', 'helps', 'make', 'transformation', 'Lincoln', 'believable', 'look', 'famous', 'Matthew', 'Brady', 'portraits', 'will', 'marvel', 'similarity', 'real', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'more', 'gaunt', 'looked', 'far', 'more', 'careworn', 'Day-Lewis', 'up', 'physical', 'shortcoming', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'man', 'pressure', 'political', 'opponents', 'uncertainty', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'war', 'outspoken', 'wife', 'protective', 'surviving', 'children.Sally', 'Field', 'real', 'surprise', 'Lincoln', 'Ms.', 'Field', 'who', 'gained', '20', 'pounds', 'role', 'Mary', 'equal', 'screen', 'husband', 'power', 'physically', 'tiny', 'particularly', 'contrast', 'Day-Lewis', 'six-foot', 'plus', 'frame', 'screen', 'scene', 'Hardly', 'shrinking', 'violet', 'mind', 'friends', 'foes', 'alike', 'White', 'House', 'function', 'instance', 'quick', 'tell', 'Thaddeus', 'Stevens', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'man', 'history', 'criticizing', 'President', 'Ms.', 'Field', 'well-tempered', 'performance', 'make', 'big', 'fancy', 'period', 'gowns', 'hats', 'look', 'right', 'home', 'tiny', 'frame.Other', 'performances', 'merit', 'include', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Vice', 'President', 'Confederacy', 'Alexander', 'Stephens', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'Secretary', 'War', 'Edwin', 'Stanton', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'political', 'wheeler-dealer', 'Preston', 'Blair', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'Ulysses', 'S.', 'Grant.Rated', 'PG-13', 'Lincoln', 'kind', 'picture', 'critical', 'praise', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'may', 'not', 'prove', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'Perhaps', 'deference', 'subject', 'matter', 'tone', 'somber', 'Spielberg', 'specialty', 'action', 'minimal', 'reliance', 'dialogue', 'often', 'impression', 'filmed', 'stage', 'play', 'rather', 'truly', 'cinematic', 'effort.Bonus', 'extras', 'four-disc', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'Pack', 'include', 'digital', 'copy', 'featurettes', 'making', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'characterization', 'film', 'methodical', 'production', 'design', 'relevance', 'Lincoln', 'modern', 'times']",N/A

1593532,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B009AMANBA,The People's Critic,"[2, 4]","Steven Spielberg is quite possibly America's most recognizable director. His career spans decades and has produced some of the most memorable films and characters in American cinematic history. Nonetheless, his prominent status has caused skeptics to write him off as superficial, crowd-pleasing, overly melodramatic, and at times corny. These attacks on Spielberg are not always unwarranted, however, his body of work is mostly impeccable and, at times, avant-garde. With Lincoln, Steven Spielberg's 31st film as director, Spielberg focuses on the 16th president's chaotic battle to pass the 13th amendment. While the battle to make the film was also rigorous, it seems that the final product is worthy of both battles.Daniel Day-Lewis once again disappears into his role, playing Abraham Lincoln in such a way that it is hard to imagine anyone else capable of playing this historical figure. Day-Lewis plays the part with a quiet confidence. Lincoln's voice is portrayed with a surprisingly warm, high registered tone. This is apparently, historically accurate and is a nice touch. Spielberg seems to know what he has here and takes a subtler approach from the technical aspect, allowing Day-Lewis and a host of other A-List actors to propel the film. Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader are particularly good as Thaddeus Stevens and W.N. Bilbo, respectively. This subtlety from the director's chair is a good decision, and while Spielberg's approach is subtle, the film is complex. It doesn't hurt that Oscar nominees and winners are in dozens of supporting roles, prompting a superior ensemble experience. Writer Tony Kushner adapts Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography expertly without losing any majesty. Kushner's dialogue is Shakespearean at times and great importance is placed on what is said, not just who is saying it.Lincoln wisely examines the final few months of the president's life as he begins his second term. This is not a traditional bio-pic; it separates itself from the routine of that genre and simply tells a great story about a president who happens to live his life through a series of great stories. Lincoln's political objective is to pass the 13th amendment abolishing slavery through the House of Representatives before the inauguration. This plan hinges on swaying lame-duck Democrats who are about to leave office to support his position. The film is truly an allegory for contemporary politics. It is very hard to watch Lincoln and not draw some pretty steep comparisons with the pageantry and stubbornness of today's political landscape.Most of Lincoln works very well. Lincoln the storyteller, Lincoln the lawyer, Lincoln the husband, and Lincoln the politician are explored evenly and with merit. The only major flaw comes when the film attempts to examine Lincoln the father. It is a well-known fact that Steven Spielberg has had some father issues. He often directs films with protagonists who have a dysfunctional relationship with their fathers. In Lincoln, this element is investigated through Lincoln's relationship with his oldest son, Bob (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Unfortunately, this story is immensely under-developed and symbolically vapid. While Lincoln's home life is deeply important to understanding the man, the misunderstanding between Lincoln and Bob leads to one mildly interesting scene that still would have been mildly interesting even if Bob was not a part of it. Regardless of Bob's significance, the conflict between father and son seems thrown together compared to the more pressing conflicts in the film, resulting in a missed opportunity.Meanwhile, Lincoln offers plenty for history buffs to sink their teeth into, and yet the story is accessible to all audiences. Spielberg takes some narrative chances to use unknown history to make well-known history compelling and interesting, especially in the film's final act. This is Spielberg's finest effort in some time. All in all, we are given a portrait of a very great man, and we are reminded of what qualities make a man great.

1593541,A2JAHPVL2EISCB,B009AMANBA,TipsWithALip,"[1, 1]","Hello, Mr. Lincoln. Nice to see you as a human being for once.My intent with this review is not to reiterate how wonderful Daniel-Day Lewis was, how wonderful Tommy Lee Jones was, etc. That horse has been beaten dead many times over. Instead, I want to touch on other topics that haven't been as adequately addressed (sorry Lincoln, that joke wasn't worthy of you).First, I want to respond to some criticisms of this movie that I don't think are valid at all.#1) ""The film is too talky or too wordy. There weren't enough Civil War battle scenes and action."" - So, in your criticism of the eponymous movie about our most eloquent and verbally gifted President, you think it is too talky and wordy. Shame on you! You don't deserve to listen to Tony Kushner's exquisite script, and if you were alive in Lincoln's time, you wouldn't deserve to listen to him either. I think it is a sad commentary on contemporary America, the America that Lincoln fought so hard to preserve, that the American people now don't want to see and hear serious discussions about serious issues presented in a very literate manner. They would rather see Abe Lincoln grab an ax and hunt vampires. Well then, go watch the vampire movie instead. Please knock yourself out.#2) ""The film is really long and lags in parts."" - How many movies have you watched? Some of the greatest film classics of all time were really long and lagged in parts. In fact, most recent epics you have seen in your unobservant life (many of them containing far too many action scenes) follow exactly that formula. I think this is another sad commentary on contemporary America that if things don't move at a lightning pace, it's time for that American to check his cell phone or other modern contrivances, contrivances whose major purposes are (in the eyes of this humble reviewer) to have people do nothing and to stroke their narcissism while they are doing nothing. 'OOOOH! I got to take a selfie of me watching Lincoln because my name is Lincoln too. Lincoln watching Lincoln. LOL!' If you are one of these people, let me tell you a little story...Back in the past sometime, a cemetery was being dedicated because of a huge battle. At that dedication, a guy named Edward Everett gave the actual address that day. His speech was a little over 2 HOURS LONG! Can you believe that? Who would do such a thing? Answer - everyone did it back then. That WAS a form of entertainment in the past somewhere. People came in droves from all around the country to hear this speech. OMG! Cra-Cra!! When his speech ended, people clapped and were impressed. Then a tall dude in a big hat got up and talked for a few minutes. The crowd didn't really like that five minute or so speech that day, and the speaker looked terrible because he was sick when he gave it. 'Why couldn't have he touched up some before that speech? Ikr!?!?!' But posterity (I'm sorry...future generations of Americans) really dug it. I think there is even some memorial about that guy or something.#3) ""There was too much humor in this movie. They took a very serious topic and treated it too lightly."" Take the cobb out of your rear and join the real world. To the people who said this, how would you cope if you were a leader during the most serious crisis and tragedy that had befallen your country until then? Oh, and then also have one of your children die while you were leader? Well, U.S. Grant coped with being the leader of the Union Army by drinking heavily. Churchill preferred that method too during his country's fight for survival in WWII. Lincoln told a lot of jokes as his coping mechanism. Is that bad? And, it's historically accurate about the man himself. Lincoln is the same man who, when called two-faced by a member of the press, responded, ""If I were two-faced, would I be wearing this one?"" Are you accusing this movie of being too faithful a representation of Lincoln's actual character? I sure hope not. If you are, go home, look in the mirror, and you'll probably see two faces.OK, with that out of the way, I'm going to go to my own criticisms of the movie, which are very few.My main problem with the movie was the ending; Spielberg, in my view, just didn't stick the landing. I felt the natural ending of the movie would have been Lincoln and his son standing in the white light as the church bells rang when the 13th Amendment was passed. The final scenes of the film, from the assassination to the second inaugural - while presented in an interesting way - just felt tacked on, perfunctory, as if the scenes had to be there but the film didn't naturally lead to them. Lincoln dies as an afternote. I should have been crying during this scene, but instead I felt like the scene was unnecessary and I did not feel much at all; that should not have happened!Closing the film with a section of Lincoln's second inaugural address through a small flame was artistic and good overall, but I think it would have been better to tie those famous compassionate lines from the speech (with malice toward none, with charity for all; but let us judge not, that we be not judged; let us strive on to. . . bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan; to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves) to the tragedy that would come. In other words, I think an ending similar in tone to John Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln, with the large storm gathering around Lincoln at the end, would have been more effective and emotionally resonant. If you show Lincoln's Second Inaugural chronologically, given only a month before his murder, you add weight to the assassination when it happens, and more important, you see how badly post-war America went without Lincoln at the helm. All that compassion, reconciliation, and hope for a united future...taken away by a bullet. Instead, Reconstruction without Lincoln was a complete disaster - the South was completely exploited instead of being treated compassionately, and political radicalism, especially in Congress, divided the country once again, with nothing but rancor on all sides. Sound familiar? Of course, ""what might have been"" has always been a fool's guessing game, but there is no doubt that Lincoln, based on his Second Inaugural speech, earnestly wanted reconciliation, compassion, and healing. That wisdom, human decency, and forgiveness at Lincoln's personal core are what America really lost on that day in Ford's Theater. And we are still suffering from it.",4,"A film that, just like America, is dominated with moments of sublime glory, but at best is still a work in progress.",1387065600,"12 15,

With the 13th Amendment passage the number one priority of our president, and the dire outcome a failed bill would create, Lincoln puts the fate of the country and his administration on the line. Daniel Day-Lewis is the perfect choice to portray Lincoln, and his acting is nothing less that superb. He's in just about every scene in the movie, and it's impressive as to how much dialogue he had to memorize. Sally Field is the perfect (well not so perfect) Mary Lincoln. I absolutely love the settings in this film and the use of different lighting to create a somewhat darker visual tone to the movie. Add some cigar smoke-filled rooms and sunlight creeping in, and what you've  got is bringing the 1860s to life. The film ends with Lincoln's assassination, but Spielberg chooses not to show it, probably because most of us have already seen our share of re-enactments or simply that Spielberg was exercising an element of class.

President Abraham Lincoln (Lewis) is trying to get the 13th Amendment to the Constitution (abolishing slavery) passed before the end of the war. Not surprisingly he meets strong opposition. Before I start as most of you know I am a huge history buff and was really looking forward to seeing this so I had high expectations. I have to admit it did not let me down at all and may have actually been better then I was hoping for. Lewis was amazing in this (as usual) and this may be his best performance so far, which is saying a lot. Im my opinion Spielberg has yet to make a bad movie and the streak does not end with this one.

Any American who cannot connect with this film on the deepest, most emotional level possible needs to start life over and pay attention.  This is visceral, emotional, gut level filmmaking that connects with the ""single greatest story that actually happened"" on a level that links civilization with soul.This is powerful, deeply felt, authentic, and written with exploding ink.  Here we see the best of man defined as exactly the opposite of the Disney treacle a few pathetic clowns on here (looking for attention or just plain dumb) have described.  This is a film that leaps into the darkest questions about human purpose and the path towards meaning.Spielberg, Tony Kushner, Daniel Day Lewis, and team explore the capabilities of cinema to examine the meaning of honor, the nature of human capability, and the mysterious art of cinema itself This is film of a million shades of grey: truly cinematic music.  If it were a composer it would be Brahms--  hardly designed to please fools.  But for those prepared to listen: infinitely rewarding.John Ford, William Wyler....and now Spielberg.  American masters who capture a truly American point of view.  Lincoln is the single most honorable film made in--and about-- America since the golden age of cinema.  Sorry-- but if you don't get that it's your own fault.  And it is a moral fault: as a citizen you're inadequate if you can't learn the meanings here.  It's your duty.  But this film is anything but ""dutiful"" and ""earnest.""  It's electric, grand, and big as the country it celebrates.(Argo?  Entertaining, skillful,  funny, but ultimately just a cheap chase third act designed to please the half awake).  Lincoln soars a million miles above every other film this year (a great year, too: one that produced wondrous delights like ""Life of Pi"" and ""Moonlight Kingdom.""  But then again-- Lincoln soars beyond any other American film made in decades.Again, I know some people out there don't get it.  But America produces both great souls and utter imbeciles.

While fighting a war to achieve that goal, you're simultaneously trying to pass legislation in furtherance of that goal. What if you fail?Abraham Lincoln (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) has brought the south to the edge of defeat in The Civil War but has yet to pass the thirteenth amendment which will outlaw slavery and involuntary servitude. He feels that he can't end the war without first passing the amendment. His cabinet, in contrast, feels they will not be able to pass the amendment if they are not trying to end the war. His Secretary of State, William Seward (played by David Strathairn) tells him that peace and the amendment are mutually exclusive. Debates among congressmen rage on the floor on a constant basis with arguments in favor of abolition being voiced by Republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens (played by Tommy Lee Jones) and arguments opposing abolition coming from Fernando Wood (played by Lee Pace) and George H. Pendleton (played by Peter McRobbie). Behind the scenes, operative William N. Bilbo (played by James Spader) is constructing backroom, and in some cases backwoods, deals that will ensure anyone who may vote for the amendment will and anyone who won't will abstain. As far as any struggles Abraham Lincoln is dealing with in his home life, his son, Robert Todd Lincoln (portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt), has abandoned studies at Harvard to join the Union army. His mother, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln (portrayed by Sally Field) is foursquare against the idea of her son going to war, as she is still dealing with the loss of two sons. Edward Baker Lincoln who died in 1850 and William Wallace Lincoln who succumbed to typhoid fever one year prior to the Emancipation Proclamation.I cannot overstate how much I enjoyed this movie. Some actors simply play themselves while answering to different names and others disappear into a role. Where Bruce Willis is the former, Daniel Day-Lewis is most definitely the latter. Makeup or no, this is not an actor's portrayal of Abraham Lincoln, this is a brilliant man transforming himself into the most courageous politician this country's ever known. Likewise, Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, a man even more devoted to the cause of abolishing slavery but far less concerned with matters such as tact and courtesy steals every scene he is in.

1593561,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B009AMANBA,Turfseer,"[37, 82]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***After reading approximately 200 books on the subject, Steven Spielberg's politically correct screenwriter, playwright Tony Kushner, decided it would be best to focus on the last four months of President Lincoln's presidency and the fight over the 13th Amendment, rather than covering Lincoln's entire term in office. Apparently, Spielberg concurred, concluding that a full-blown rendering of Lincoln's presidency would be unwieldy and the more narrow focus would perhaps be more dramatically effective. He could have proffered up a three to three and a half hour spectacle, covering many of the significant bases of Lincoln's political and personal life, beginning with the first Inauguration, with full knowledge that it's been done before quite effectively (I'm referring to Sam Waterston's and Mary Tyler Moore's magisterial performances in the 1988 TV movie adaptation of 'Gore Vidal's Lincoln').First and foremost, what's missing here is little sense of Lincoln's brilliance as a master politician. Since most of the movie focuses on the machinations in the House of Representatives, focusing on the fight over the passage of the 13th Amendment, Lincoln's input is minimal. Tommy Lee Jones, as Radical Republican, Thaddeus Stevens, steals the show with his brilliant performance as the fiery abolitionist representative, who ends up giving up his quest for equal rights for blacks in order to have slavery abolished, with the passage of the 13th Amendment. Spielberg's opus is supposed to be based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, 'Team of Rivals'--but where is the 'team'?All the fascinating characters from Lincoln's cabinet are missing interacting with one another. In the Gore Vidal movie, both Seward and Secretary of the Treasury Chase's political ambitions are dissected and we actually get a sense of what their personalities are like. Here, David Strathairn as Seward, stands around with nothing much to do as Lincoln's adviser. Lincoln actually had to balance the conflicting positions and personalities of the members of his cabinet. This is effectively conveyed in both Gore Vidal's novel and TV adaptation but not at all in Spielberg's 'Lincoln'.Wonderful peripheral figures who are an integral part of the Lincoln story are lost due to Spielberg and Kushner's onerous decision to ignore the earlier history. The 1988 biopic includes them: Kate Chase, Salmon Chases' daughter, who married the ""boy governor"" of Rhode Island, millionaire businessman turned General, William Sprague; Senator Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's debate rival; Billy Herndon, Lincoln's former law partner and McClellan, Lincoln's failed first general, who later opposed him in the Election of 1864.Spielberg is more interested in offering up a litany of the arcane--explicating a myriad of one member after the other from the House of Representatives--all extremely minor figures, now lost to history. Spielberg and Kushner spend so much time on the vote in the House of Representatives, as if this is the defining moment of Lincoln's presidency. Perhaps from a modern perspective, yes! But I found it hard to believe that the bells were chiming and there were was a giant parade in pro-rebel Washington, D.C., on the day the 13th Amendment was passed. The real cheering was on April 9, 1865, when the South surrendered. The end of the war was of course the main concern of the people of the time, not necessarily the abolition of slavery.Watching Spielberg's 'Lincoln', one can hardly realize that there was indeed a dark side to our 16th President. The suspension of Habeas Corpus and Lincoln's prosecution of political enemies without due process of law, is an aspect of the Lincoln presidency hardly addressed in Spielberg's flattering hagiography. Lincoln's view of African-Americans was decidedly less progressive than Spielberg lets on here. Even shortly before the end of the Civil War, Lincoln was still entertaining schemes of colonization for blacks in South America and Africa.And what of Mary Todd Lincoln? Sally Field looks a lot more like Mary Todd than Mary Tyler Moore did in the 1988 mini-series, but Moore truly turns the President's wife into a fully-realized character. With Kushner's sketchy script, Field only is able to touch upon a few of the major points of Mary Todd's life in the White House. In the Gore Vidal movie, we actually get to see and FEEL the devastating effect son Willie's death had upon her, as it occurs in real time. Here (like so many of the earlier events during the Lincoln Presidency), it is only alluded to. What's more, Mary Todd's meltdowns (probably today characterized as 'bipolar') are only tangentially dealt with, as opposed to the earlier TV movie, where they are an integral part of the story.Kushner creates a non-part for the character of Elizabeth Keckley, the African-American dressmaker turned servant to Mary Todd Lincoln. In the 1988 biopic, there's actually a relationship shown between the two women, with Keckley morphing into a confidante, in effect acting as a sounding board for Mary Todd Lincoln's actual views on slavery. In Spielberg's 'Lincoln', there's a short unlikely scene where Keckley confronts Lincoln on the front porch of the White House, musing about the future fate of African Americans in the U.S.Daniel Day Lewis is as good as Sam Waterston back in 1988 but unfortunately he just doesn't have a good script to work with. Probably the best scene in the film is the confrontation between Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens in the White House pantry. But because none of the other 'team of rivals' is developed, Lincoln has hardly anyone to play off of here. Spielberg's attempt to examine Lincoln's personal life also falls flat. The melodramatic scene where he slaps son Robert, feels completely out of character!Before you praise Spielberg's 'Lincoln' to the hilt, go out and purchase Gore Vidal's Lincoln. It's only $4.89 at deepdiscountdvd.com and Sam Waterston is simply excellent as the politician and the man, warts and all! As usual, Spielberg's production values far outshine the low budget efforts on television. Ultimately, one should expect more from the famed director instead of his narrow focus on such an iconic figure.",2,Spielberg's narrow in scope hagiography can't hold a candle to 1988 Gore Vidal TV

Great acting and an extremely movie story that may not take 90 minutes to complete.Steven Spielberg gives us an incredible film in his latest 'Lincoln' This was a movie that has been talked about for years and after many changes all across the spectrum it finally comes to the theaters. What it is may not be the most exciting film, but it is a true piece of natural history. The movie does not just give us the points this historic figures life we know about. It dives deep inside to discover the fact that even a president can just be an average man. Not a perfect man by any means, but a good man. This movie is lengthy and gives you a true sense of power and meaning. The cast chosen could not be better. Daniel Day Lewis gave an incredible performance that won him another Oscar, which was worthy. Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and even James Spader gave great presence in their roles. The events that unfold are gripping even though it all takes place in political halls. The ending of course leaves you breathless and at the same time a true feeling of patriotism.Unfortunately, due to the pace and style that is not what the average movie goer these days is use to, this film may not live up to most of your expectations.

The second time around (and it is worth seeing twice) the dialogue seemed more cohesive and coherant. It was also easier to lose Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones in their characters. The first time around I kept waiting for Day Lewis to say something about drinking milkshakes in that supposed highly researched tone of voice he used. I  feel like this film might have been better as a TV mini-series, like Lonsome Dove, so that the supporting characters could have been completely fleshed out creating empathy for them and so the historical context could have been more thourougly explored.

1593592,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B009AMANBA,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[4, 8]","Lincoln, directed by Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Tony Kushner adapted from the book Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin, is a truly extraordinary film.  It's exactly what you'd hope for from an Academy Award-winning director (6 nominations, 2 wins), an award-winning playwright (4 Tony nominations & 2 wins, 1 Academy Award nomination, and a Pulitzer) and a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, supported by a cast of some of the most gifted actors working today and an equally gifted production crew with vast experience in every aspect of film-making.  It is, quite simply, a masterpiece and one of the most compelling works to come out of Hollywood in the last decade or more.The film focuses on the critical month of January in 1865, when President Lincoln (a stunning portrayal by Daniel Day Lewis) was faced with a dilemma.  Though the end of the Civil War was now clearly in sight, the South was still fighting stubbornly on, determined to resist until the bitter end, and each month the war continued would mean thousands upon thousands more dead on both sides.  As a result, the desire for a negotiated peace on both sides was significant.  At the same time, the issue of slavery remained unsettled, and Lincoln feared that unless he was able to get the abolition of slavery enshrined in the Constitution before the war ended, his Emancipation Proclamation could ultimately be overturned in the courts.  More critically, if he failed to get the Constitutional amendment abolishing slavery passed by Congress before the war ended, the return of the Southern delegations to Congress would prevent the needed amendment from ever being passed, requiring as it did a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress. The amendment had already been passed in the Senate, but the issue in the House was still very much in doubt, with ""Copperhead"" Democrats sympathetic to the South mostly against the bill along with a number of Republicans for whom an end to the war was more important than an end to slavery.  Faced with these pressures and the very fractious political divisions in Congress and even in his own Cabinet, Lincoln decides to press on and gamble everything on getting the 13th Amendment passed before the war ends.One of the things Spielberg does extremely well in Lincoln is bringing out just how complex the issue of abolition was for Americans at the time.  Various groups were for or against the abolition of slavery for a variety of reasons, and in a variety of ways.  Many of those who were against the idea of slavery were also however against the idea of racial equality, finding it morally offensive.  Some who were against slavery were nonetheless reluctant to abolish it out of the fear of what millions of suddenly-free black people might do, while others were afraid of the economic competition such a sudden influx of people needing work might present.  On the other side, many radical abolitionists, personified by their leader in the House, Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (a scene-stealing and very Oscar-worthy performance by Tommy Lee Jones), were pressing for full emancipation, meaning the full recognition of black people as being equal in every way to whites, and were loathe to compromise on the issue.Further complicating the problem was that the make-up of Congress was set to change when the newly elected Congress took its place in March.  Some Republicans were pressing Lincoln to wait for the new Congress, which would have a bigger majority of Republicans, to be seated before bringing the amendment forward, but Lincoln feared the war ending before the bill could be passed.  He also felt that he could use the fact that many lame-duck Democrats who'd been defeated in the 1864 election could be persuaded, pressured or in effect bribed into voting for the Amendment, another potential advantage that he would lose if he waited.  One of the best points about the film is how it shows in a number of dramatic and comical scenes that the old adage about politics and sausage - ""The less the people know about how sausages and laws are made, the better they sleep in the night"" - was as true back then as it is today.  It is to Spielberg and Kushner's credit that they bring out all of these complexities without having to resort to tedious blocks of lumpy exposition, and the pace never suffers.  For a film that is two and a half hours long, the pacing is so well done that it actually feels like a much shorter film.Credit for this must also be given to the superb cast.  Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln shows us a very complex woman who is at once a formidable but equally problematic First Lady, defending her husband while at the same time creating problems for him with his political allies with her sharp but too often intemperate tongue.  And adding to the pressures on him by insisting that he keep their eldest son, Robert, out of the war, even as he carries the burden of sending hundreds of thousands of other parents' sons off to the deadliest war in US history.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln plays his role subtly but ably, a young man torn between being sickened by the things he sees in visiting an Army hospital but feeling that he has no choice but to take on the responsibility and the accompanying risks that so many other young men his age have taken on.  David Strathairn does an excellent job as Lincoln's Secretary of State, William Seward, showing a man of great ability and unquestioned loyalty to Lincoln who must contend with the knowledge that Lincoln has been keeping things from him, most particularly his initiating secret negotiations with a Confederate delegation to discuss peace in order to placate the conservative Republicans he needs to keep on his side.  An almost unrecognizable James Spader has a delicious turn as political operative William Bilbo whom Lincoln puts in charge of securing the votes of the lame-duck Democrats by any means necessary.  And Jackie Earle Haley turns in a deftly nuanced portrayal of Alexander Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy and head of the secret delegation sent to negotiate a potential peace with Lincoln, showing a man who at once quietly personifies why the South was continuing to fight on even while knowing in spite of himself which way the winds are truly blowing.There are in fact too many actors turning in fine roles in Lincoln to properly mention all of them, but my absolute favorite was Tommy Lee Jones' delicious - and at times highly moving - performance as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, the staunch abolitionist leader of the Radical Republicans in the House and one of the most formidable verbal duelists that institution has ever seen.  Stevens' ability to verbally eviscerate his opponents - on the House floor and anywhere else for that matter - was the stuff of legend, as Jones shows in a number of scene-stealing moments throughout the film.  Lincoln is bound to get any number of Academy Award nominations, but the one I would personally most like to see is for Jones to be nominated for - and win - the award for Best Supporting Actor, if only for one key moment in the film where Stevens is forced into what is for him a highly distasteful compromise, but one he knows is absolutely necessary in order for the 13th Amendment to win passage.  The turmoil of the moment is etched on Jones' craggy face as Stevens forces himself, almost literally choking on the words, to declare that he is only for equality under the law, publicly turning his back on his many previous calls for complete racial equality.  But when the head of the Copperhead Democrats, Congressman George Pendleton (Peter McRobbie) attempts to goad him into a more revealing statement, Jones' Stevens instead seizes the moment and turns the attack back on Pendleton, not only humiliating him in front of the entire House but actually using him to make his point that all men - even Pendleton, whom he deems ""more reptile than man"" - are deserving of equality under the law.  It is a high moment in the film, as is a particularly poignant one that follows later, where we find out why Stevens is so deeply passionate about his cause.  Truly a bravura performance by a highly talented veteran actor.The production crew is equally formidable in terms of the vast array of talent and experience they bring to the film, many of them veterans of previous Spielberg films, like cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (five Academy Award nominations, two wins), film editor Michael Kahn (seven nominations, three wins), costume designer Joanna Johnston, and numerous others.  The production values bring the world and the era of Lincoln vividly to life, from the extraordinary attention to detail given to everything from costuming and set design to the ways in which the camerawork and sound immerse us in the events we are brought to witness.  And John Williams, the almost ubiquitous scorer of many a Spielberg film, wisely gives Lincoln a more subtle musical touch this time around, quietly adding to the atmosphere of the moment but never threatening to overpower or distract from the human events playing out on the screen.But it is on Daniel Day Lewis's shoulders that the heart of Lincoln rests, and he carries the task superbly.  More than any actor who has ever tackled the role, Lewis succeeds in bringing Lincoln the man to life.  The physical resemblance achieved is simply stunning, as if Lincoln himself has walked out of any number of Civil War photographs and onto the film screen.  More than that are the ways Lewis uses facial expression and body language to convey everything from the way Lincoln quietly keeps his own internal counsel as he weighs the issues and the almost crushing mental and emotional burden he carries, knowing that he is the one ultimately responsible not only for every wounded or dead soldier he sees as the war grinds on but also for the future of every black person in America if he fails to secure their freedom before that terrible war comes to an end.  Lewis also manages, quite impressively, to capture the high reedy voice and mixed Southern/Midwestern accent Lincoln was described as having.  What makes his Lincoln truly work though are the ways in which he brings out Lincoln's ability to connect with ordinary people, often through jokes and anecdotes, so often in fact that it provokes a highly comic outburst from Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Bruce McGill) when Lincoln unexpectedly appears in the army's command center:  ""You're going to tell one of your stories!  I can't stand to hear another one of your stories!"".  But just as often, Lewis's Lincoln communicates through words that frame the issues at hand with compelling clarity, words that still resonate with us even today, as the film reminds us when it ends with a quotation from his second inaugural address:""With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.""In a film destined to pick up a slew of award nominations - and wins - none is more certain, or more deserved, than the ones Lewis will receive for Best Actor for Lincoln.  No performance I have seen this year, or even in any recent year, even comes close.Highly, highly recommended, for its masterful performances, for its bringing vividly to life a moment of great historical significance, and for simply being a truly great film.",5,"A stunning portrayal by Daniel Day Lewis in a finely crafted, eloquent and ultimately highly moving film",1354492800,"12 3,

1593593,ACG3UUASNO30I,B009AMANBA,William B. Fankboner,"[1, 1]","The opening scene of the movie, in which a small group of adoring Union soldiers reverently recite passages from the Gettysburg Address to Abe Lincoln, almost jinxed ""Lincoln"" for me. I thought: Oh no! Not another hokey, cornball Spielberg production (""War Horse,"" ""The Pacific,"" ""Saving Private Ryan"").Fortunately Spielberg's buffoonish sentimental gesture was the last. Once Tony Kushner's script kicks into high gear things really begin to move forward and the narrative of the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment proceeds to a satisfying climax. Along the way we learn a good deal about the personal Lincoln we might not have known, and about legislative processes of the Civil War Congress. Little has changed: money and influence peddling ruled the Capital. That said, the art of political oratory in those days was superior to today's Congressional flannel-mouths (Lincoln wasn't the only practitioner of soaring political rhetoric). And thanks to his collaboration with historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Tony Kushner's grasp of the historical details of the American legislative process was commanding.Daniel Day-Lewis's character study of Lincoln was a revelation: imaginative, compelling and nuanced. There wasn't a moment when I didn't feel I was in the presence of Lincoln. Was it a bit of a sacrilege to cast a Brit as America's greatest president? Well, not exactly. The English have always participated in our political dramas: if it hadn't been for the intervention of an Englishman, the Liberty Bell would have been melted down for candleholders.I mentioned that the first scene was the only instance of Spielberg's signature sentimentality, but there was another exhibit at the end, just as Lincoln dies, and the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton intones with all the subtlety of a grade school play, ""Now he belongs to the ages."" There is some question as to whether Stanton actually uttered these words at the time, or whether they were added to the Lincoln myth as an afterthought; in any event, if Spielberg felt the need to use such a quote, it should not have been so prominently showcased, but a subdued thread in the fabric of the scene.",5,A Watershed in Cinematic History,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,2163,"['opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'small', 'group', 'adoring', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'reverently', 'recite', 'passages', 'Gettysburg', 'Address', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'almost', 'jinxed', 'Lincoln', 'thought', 'Oh', 'Not', 'hokey', 'cornball', 'Spielberg', 'production', 'War', 'Horse', 'Pacific', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', '.Fortunately', 'Spielberg', 'buffoonish', 'sentimental', 'gesture', 'was', 'last', 'Once', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'script', 'high', 'gear', 'things', 'really', 'begin', 'move', 'forward', 'narrative', 'adoption', 'Thirteenth', 'Amendment', 'proceeds', 'satisfying', 'climax', 'way', 'learn', 'good', 'deal', 'personal', 'Lincoln', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'legislative', 'processes', 'Civil', 'War', 'Congress', 'Little', 'changed', 'money', 'influence', 'peddling', 'ruled', 'Capital', 'said', 'art', 'political', 'oratory', 'days', 'was', 'superior', 'today', 'Congressional', 'flannel-mouths', 'Lincoln', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'practitioner', 'soaring', 'political', 'rhetoric', 'thanks', 'collaboration', 'historian', 'Doris', 'Kearns', 'Goodwin', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'grasp', 'historical', 'details', 'American', 'legislative', 'process', 'was', 'commanding.Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'character', 'study', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'revelation', 'imaginative', 'compelling', 'nuanced', 'was', ""n't"", 'moment', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'presence', 'Lincoln', 'Was', 'bit', 'sacrilege', 'cast', 'Brit', 'America', 'greatest', 'president', 'Well', 'not', 'exactly', 'English', 'have', 'always', 'participated', 'political', 'dramas', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'intervention', 'Englishman', 'Liberty', 'Bell', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'melted', 'down', 'candleholders.I', 'mentioned', 'first', 'scene', 'was', 'only', 'instance', 'Spielberg', 'signature', 'sentimentality', 'there', 'was', 'exhibit', 'end', 'just', 'Lincoln', 'Secretary', 'War', 'Edwin', 'M.', 'Stanton', 'intones', 'subtlety', 'grade', 'school', 'play', 'Now', 'ages', 'question', 'Stanton', 'actually', 'uttered', 'words', 'time', 'were', 'added', 'Lincoln', 'myth', 'afterthought', 'event', 'Spielberg', 'felt', 'need', 'use', 'such', 'quote', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'prominently', 'showcased', 'subdued', 'thread', 'fabric', 'scene']",N/A

I would suggest that it is his most talkative film. It is almost non stop dialogue. Punctuated by scenes of war. Always as darkly lit as those candle times, it is the director's only Victorian picture.The opening is gruesome hand to hand, edge of screen to edge of screen combat. From then on the film is all about the words that are fought for. The two lads who could recite his Gettysburg address, the Confederate peacemakers who lament their loss of culture and history. The words which make up the 13th Amendment: the words 'freedom' and 'slavery.'And let's not forget business. The South had an unfair advantage over the North particularly in agriculture. The discovery of oil and how it replaced the need for human slaves was not mentioned or alluded to.Where the movie works really well is the back-room politicking and the court-room like atmosphere of the Senate floor. Memories ofMr. Smith Goes to Washingtonand particularly the brilliantInherit the Windwere amply fortified by the director's harnessing of tension and suspense. I was leaning forward in my reclining chair. Transfixed. I also enjoyed the contrast between the strident emotions of Sally Field as the First Lady verses the cool perceptions of her husband. She could also verbally joust with the best of them.For all the magnetism of the Day-Lewis central performance Mr Spielberg succeeds in making the words within the movie resonate with a twenty first century audience. Make no mistake: this is American propaganda. The intellect and human appreciation of the former President is seen to be the driving force behind the historic decision to end slavery in the USA. Those who naively believe there is such a thing as race will be floored by Lincoln. The closing scenes beautifully illustrating the human bed covers all words into one. Love.",5,It's about a word.

1593610,AP3B615GM191G,B009AMANBA,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[4, 6]","Before heading to the theater to see ""Lincoln"", I had read a number of reviews stating how it was ""long-winded"" and ""just a lot of talking"".  Because of Steven Spielberg's track record, though, I had a pretty good inkling that it would be a solid effort.  Even against those expectations, though, I was blown away by Mr. Spielberg's ability to make a contemplative film as intriguing and engrossing as any of his other action/adventure fare.For a basic plot summary, ""Lincoln"" focuses on President Lincoln's (Daniel Day-Lewis) dogged persistence to pass the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery towards the end of the Civil War.  Other major players in the narrative include wife Mary Todd (Sally Field), William Seward (David Strathairn), Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook), & Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones).The most amazing trait of ""Lincoln"" is its ability to, despite being more ""talk than action"", so to speak, craft a compelling, inspiring tale filled with emotions about politics that still ring true today.  The events may be sent 150 years ago, but the material still feels fresh and never boring.  Also helping matters is that film only builds upon itself as it plays out, resulting in the most breathtaking material commencing towards the last 30-40 minutes of the picture when all the characters/events have been set up for some impressive climaxes.  Basically, it's just Spielberg doing his directorial thing (!).Also helping matters is the wonderful acting throughout.  The auxiliary cast are all well-placed, but it is (of course) the performance of President Lincoln that makes or breaks this flick.  Luckily, Day-Lewis should win an Oscar for this turn, as he so expertly captures the nuances of the script and it s sometimes comedic, sometimes somber, sometimes inspirational passages.The simple musical score from John Williams is, again, pretty much par for the course (i.e. brilliant!).  It is a powerful score, but one that does not detract from the words/actions onscreen.Overall, I consider ""Lincoln"" to be a marvelous film that does so many things well.

They took all cell phones from everybody (what a treat...) and everybody was really quiet and followed the movie. This is the way to enjoy a movie in a movie theater. I wish they will do this for all movies and all viewings.What a performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones. This is the real Lincoln. The compassionate Abraham Lincoln.Sally Field is outstanding and Tommy Lee Jones has probably given all he had to this movie. I understand why Daniel Day Lewis makes movies only every two-three years. I assume he needs to get out (mentally) of the character he just played. The intensity of his performance is equal to the one in ""There Will be Blood"". He will definitely win the Oscar this year. I don't see anybody competing with him.This is not an action movie. If you expect action, fighting, blood and intense thriller-like moments, forget it. Move on to the next movie. This film is about pure performance and great acting. This is about great dialogues and great historic drama. This is about the dream of a great man to abolish slavery. He proposed the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in spite of the opposition. He stood by it like a big man. He won the votes of some members of the Democrat Party by doing whatever it takes, because he knew he was right. Didn't care about his public image or the next election. He realized that he needed to save the Republic. He compromised because he needed to save the country. He new that abolition was the first step. Other leaders in the future would get the rest. Where are these kind of leaders today? We missed you Mr. Lincoln.Beside the major plot of the movie, the smaller secondary plot that involves Lincoln and his son is interesting and really puts things in perspective. Even a president like Lincoln will use his privileges to keep his son out of the war.Five stars all around for everything, including the great direction by Spielberg.",5,A man with integrity and honnor!
