1356178,A2OZBKX9BWADBH,B003O9ZWIY,Charlotte Sometimes,"[7, 11]","Just to clear any confusion,THIS DVD IS REGION 1, MEANING IT WILL PLAY ON DVD PLAYERS IN NORTH AMERICA AND IN AMERICAN TERRITORIES.Although the cover art may be reminiscent of a softcore porn taking place in Medieval times, this movie was great. When I first saw the DVD cover image, I seriously was appalled. The European version depicts the true essence of the film with the actual actress, Anna Friel,on the cover. The American DVD image is insulting and I can't help but think that this was a deliberate action to entice a ""daft"" American visual palette.With that one thing out of the way, I can certainly say that this movie is wonderful. It is artfully rendered, very dreamy and surreal, a true cinematic masterpiece. Such a gorgeous movie to watch. You can literally mute this film and watch it with stars in your eyes.Everything I've read about Bathory is elusive and this movie doesn't escape that. We will never know the true story of The Countess or what she did/did not do.This story takes a different approach to what we know about Countess Bathory, and I honestly was not expecting it. If you are hoping to see excessive amounts of blood and gore,this movie will certainly disappoint you. It's not at all over the top violent.Intelligent, poignant, romantic, and beautiful, Bathory:Countess of Blood is highly recommended if you just love a great story about love, life and the tragedies that befall us all.",5,Surreal and Magnificent Masterpiece,1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,1421,"['Just', 'clear', 'confusion', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'IS', 'REGION', '1', 'MEANING', 'IT', 'WILL', 'PLAY', 'ON', 'DVD', 'PLAYERS', 'IN', 'NORTH', 'AMERICA', 'AND', 'IN', 'AMERICAN', 'TERRITORIES.Although', 'cover', 'art', 'may', 'be', 'reminiscent', 'softcore', 'porn', 'taking', 'place', 'Medieval', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'DVD', 'cover', 'image', 'seriously', 'was', 'appalled', 'European', 'version', 'true', 'essence', 'film', 'actual', 'actress', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'cover', 'American', 'DVD', 'image', 'insulting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'was', 'deliberate', 'action', 'entice', 'daft', 'American', 'visual', 'palette.With', 'one', 'thing', 'way', 'can', 'certainly', 'say', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'artfully', 'rendered', 'very', 'dreamy', 'surreal', 'true', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'watch', 'can', 'literally', 'mute', 'film', 'watch', 'stars', 'eyes.Everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Bathory', 'elusive', 'movie', ""n't"", 'escape', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'true', 'story', 'Countess', 'what', 'did/did', 'not', 'do.This', 'story', 'different', 'approach', 'what', 'know', 'Countess', 'Bathory', 'honestly', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'are', 'hoping', 'see', 'excessive', 'amounts', 'blood', 'gore', 'movie', 'will', 'certainly', 'disappoint', 'not', 'top', 'violent.Intelligent', 'poignant', 'romantic', 'beautiful', 'Bathory', 'Countess', 'Blood', 'highly', 'recommended', 'just', 'love', 'great', 'story', 'love', 'life', 'tragedies', 'befall']","Bathory (2008) ( Untitled Juraj Jakubisko Project ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Spain ]"
1356179,A2TDIFABWXWNNP,B003O9ZWIY,David L. Bullock,"[3, 3]","I actually agree with nearly all of the reviewers whether they liked this movie or not. Each reviewer has a perspective that is hard to argue with -- simply because the facts in this case -- the historical records -- are too meager to know the truth for certain. This is a lavish costume piece, European style, and is a European movie. Many North American viewers may not warm to it because it was not what we expected. There were moments of boredom and moments of excitement. No vampires, no grotesque spectacles of blood, but a few decent-enough battles. The unusual inventions of the monks seem outlandish at first pass; however, similar inventions had cropped up from ancient Greece forward. These were one-off inventions referenced throughout Europe and the Middle East. Lacking the machine-tooling and production lines of the modern industrial age,these inventions survived the death of their inventors only as a memory or sketch. Noble women had access to the highest education and possessed the privilege of money and time to develop themselves and so Elizabeth Bathory's skill even as a swordswoman did not phase me either. As a PhD in European Military History, I thought the political intrigue and dynastic rivalries were spot on, as well as how a noblewoman was portrayed in that vortex with all of the strengths and weaknesses that were representative of the times. I had read the books and legends associated with Bathory, but do not claim to be any expert. I bought the legends at face value. Now I wonder where legend and reality begin and end. This is exactly what the central European director and scriptwriters were trying to achieve. Two considerations cause me to pause and not dismiss this movie as fantasy in whole or part. First, thirty-four years either as a military officer or a modest government official have taught me much about how administrations, personal greed, power elites, and machinations can take a good person -- or an unfavored person -- and demonize them, even if innocent. With so much land and wealth at stake, and situated in the middle of major rivalries encompassing the Imperial, Hungarian and Turkish elites, Elizabeth Bathory made an excellent and profitable target. Second, there is at least one other figure, Richard III of England who was similarly portrayed as a monster for over 400 years. I studied Richard for a year and find myself in complete accord with the Ricardian Society that has almost entirely vindicated his reign. All of Richard's supporters were either killed in battle or supressed politically, almost all records attesting to his good kingship were destroyed by the succeeding dynasty, the Tudors, legends replaced reality -- of course written by the victors -- and his portraits were altered to present a man of evil. Why are the records about Elizabeth Bathory so meager? The testimony of paid or tortured witnesses are abundant enough. Hopefully, one day, we may come closer to the truth, whether she was the monster of legend, or the heroine that this film suggests. And the truth shall set us free.",5,Interesting alternative take on the legend,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,3075,"['actually', 'agree', 'nearly', 'reviewers', 'liked', 'movie', 'not', 'reviewer', 'perspective', 'hard', 'argue', 'simply', 'facts', 'case', 'historical', 'records', 'are', 'too', 'meager', 'know', 'truth', 'certain', 'lavish', 'costume', 'piece', 'European', 'style', 'European', 'movie', 'Many', 'North', 'American', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'warm', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'were', 'moments', 'boredom', 'moments', 'excitement', 'vampires', 'grotesque', 'spectacles', 'blood', 'few', 'decent-enough', 'battles', 'unusual', 'inventions', 'monks', 'seem', 'outlandish', 'first', 'pass', 'however', 'similar', 'inventions', 'had', 'cropped', 'up', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'forward', 'were', 'one-off', 'inventions', 'referenced', 'Europe', 'Middle', 'East', 'Lacking', 'machine-tooling', 'production', 'lines', 'modern', 'industrial', 'age', 'inventions', 'survived', 'death', 'inventors', 'only', 'memory', 'sketch', 'Noble', 'women', 'had', 'access', 'highest', 'education', 'possessed', 'privilege', 'money', 'time', 'develop', 'so', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'skill', 'even', 'swordswoman', 'did', 'not', 'phase', 'either', 'PhD', 'European', 'Military', 'History', 'thought', 'political', 'intrigue', 'dynastic', 'rivalries', 'were', 'spot', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'noblewoman', 'was', 'portrayed', 'vortex', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'were', 'representative', 'times', 'had', 'read', 'books', 'legends', 'associated', 'Bathory', 'do', 'not', 'claim', 'be', 'expert', 'bought', 'legends', 'face', 'value', 'Now', 'wonder', 'where', 'legend', 'reality', 'begin', 'end', 'exactly', 'what', 'central', 'European', 'director', 'scriptwriters', 'were', 'trying', 'achieve', 'Two', 'considerations', 'cause', 'pause', 'not', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'whole', 'part', 'First', 'thirty-four', 'years', 'military', 'officer', 'modest', 'government', 'official', 'have', 'taught', 'much', 'how', 'administrations', 'personal', 'greed', 'power', 'elites', 'machinations', 'can', 'take', 'good', 'person', 'unfavored', 'person', 'demonize', 'even', 'innocent', 'so', 'much', 'land', 'wealth', 'stake', 'situated', 'middle', 'major', 'rivalries', 'encompassing', 'Imperial', 'Hungarian', 'Turkish', 'elites', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'made', 'excellent', 'profitable', 'target', 'Second', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'figure', 'Richard', 'III', 'England', 'who', 'was', 'similarly', 'portrayed', 'monster', '400', 'years', 'studied', 'Richard', 'year', 'find', 'complete', 'accord', 'Ricardian', 'Society', 'almost', 'entirely', 'vindicated', 'reign', 'Richard', 'supporters', 'were', 'either', 'killed', 'battle', 'supressed', 'politically', 'almost', 'records', 'attesting', 'good', 'kingship', 'were', 'destroyed', 'succeeding', 'dynasty', 'Tudors', 'legends', 'replaced', 'reality', 'course', 'written', 'victors', 'portraits', 'were', 'altered', 'present', 'man', 'evil', 'Why', 'are', 'records', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'so', 'meager', 'testimony', 'paid', 'tortured', 'witnesses', 'are', 'abundant', 'enough', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'may', 'come', 'closer', 'truth', 'was', 'monster', 'legend', 'heroine', 'film', 'truth', 'shall', 'set', 'free']","Bathory (2008) ( Untitled Juraj Jakubisko Project ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Spain ]"

It was in constant warfare and the turks weren't defeated in their attempt to crusade for islam until the late 1600's , this is the late 1500's period. And there's no doubt that it was a bloody age. And that a woman left in charge of a area would have to order the deaths of people etc. In this movie we get a version of the countess that shows her to be brutal and yet doing good things as well.  It's a long movie, but one does wonder if the truth of the countess is closer to this picture?. We just don't know which is correct. She may have been the bloody killer who slaughtered for blood , or perhaps she killed a few people like in this movie. Unlike count Dracula whose massive killing was known by everyone , we get stories from a single town and castle. So what was the truth?  This is a interesting take on the countess of blood historical  story.  It would be interesting to know the real story though. Was she the complete monster we know and fear? Or something less? This movie took a bold step to tell a story that is plausible and it is not boring imo. It is a very long movie though. It's around 3 hours long. But it is a well done show. You decide which version you enjoy of this historical figure. I do like ""the countess"" starring Julie Delpy a lot. Or the earlier countess movies , and there's a number of them going back to the 1970's. One starred the great Ingrid pitt and that one is worth watching for sure. This one is long but, who knows how much this reflects the real countess. The acting in this one is superb though. The lead actress puts in a major performance here, and that's a good thing. the dvd looks great though and it's worth owning if you like historical dramas.

But I simply can't get past  the film's total distortion of available history. Nor will it do to simply say that ""nobody knows"" what Elizabeth Bathory reslly or did not do. While no history is absolutely reliable, in the case of Bathory we have transcripts of her trial in which she found guilty of  numerous atrocities and acts of unspeakable cruelty inflicted upon her slaves, servants, villagers and peasants whom she used , abused and exploited. Because of her high station she was not  executed for her crimes, , but instead walled up in a castle where she could commit no further crimes. Her underlings on the other hand were ordered by the court to be tortured to death as punishment  for the the terrible crimes which they committed on Bathory's orders and for their mistress' amusement and pleasure. That her conviction may have served to alleviate the debts owed to her by her debtors is hardly evidence that rebuts the sworn testimony of so many witnesses at the trial who were not her debtors. It is true that there was no real evidence of her bathing  in blood or being a vampire (a story concocted after her death by imaginative fiction writers bent on sensationalism), but ironically that is the only part of the story the film depicts, although even that is watered down by the suggestion that perhaps it was only herbal red dye she was bathing in. But the available evidence and trial transcripts leave no doubt that Bathory abused her almost absolute power as mistress within her castles to  inflict unspeakable cruelties upon those subservient to her. While the theme of the film could have been that power corrupts, that absolute power corrupts absolutely,  or even the power of beauty itself, it instead catered to the tiresome  vampire cult, even while dressing it up in admittedly gorgeous cinematography.

This is an embellished version of historical events.This is the story of Elizabeth Bathory (Anna Friel) who lived during a time of conflict between the east and west and Catholic and Protestant religions. She was able to survive one, but not the other. This tale depicts the countess as slightly mentally unstable suffering from a disease of the blood. There are scenes which blend reality with dreams in a surreal fashion. It worked rather well for me, but there wasn't a lot of it. Bathory was ruthless and beautiful. In an effort to gain her wealth, her enemies accused her of heinous crimes, at least some of which were true.What you will first notice is the costumes. They went to great length and expense in this aspect reminding me of Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon.""  Some of the background is CG, such as the castle with its constant full moon and some of the fires. The monk and his assistant made inventions which made this account seem fictional. Indeed, both of them and the Italian artist appear to be Hollywood creations. Anna Darvulia is historical, but her exact influence is unknown. The film is long: 2 hours and 20 minutes. It moves at a slow and steady pace. You do feel the time. This movie is a not for everybody. It is artsy and based on a true story.

It is a take on the life of Elizabeth Bathory. She lived in Hungary in the sixteenth century and has gone down in history as the biggest female mass murderer of all time. She is still credited in the Guinness Book of Records with that particular title.  She was married at an early age to the Prince and soon becomes the number one lady.They are more or less permanently repulsing invasions from the Moslems and Turks, so the power struggles and alliances tend to ebb and flow with the ferocity of the invaders attacks. They also have a young Caravaggio, who they capture from the Turks who ends up dipping more than his paintbrush and adding some altogether much needed artistic gusto to the whole proceedings.Anna Friel does a spot on job and is both beautiful and believable in the role. There is an however and that is in the portrayal of Bathory herself. Legend has it that she killed over 600, virgins and bathed in their blood to preserve her beauty, and that she was a bit of a vampire (well you would wouldn't you). This is all sort of glossed over and she is presented as some herbal bathing Florence Nightingale. This has caused some consternation amongst vampire/horror fans who were hoping for a bit more fangs and blood. Instead we have conspiracy theories that go all the way to the Vatican. As is said in the film, ""people like legends more than the truth, and some would say that is what you should have made the film about then.That said, there is quite a bit of blood letting and it is all done very well, there is also some good battle scenes and some great backdrops and good cinematography. We also have a witch, dream sequences and a very well portrayed journey into madness. What does take away from the film is the dubbing. This was filmed in more than one language and the English dubbed on after, it is not always obvious but the sound become s a bit seventies Kung Fu on a number of occasions - pity.That said this as an ambitious and evocative movie, Director Juraj Jakubisko has woven a great story and told it almost beautifully. He probably could have benefitted from some editing as this runs to 135 minutes, but I would be hard pressed to say what should have been cut. If you like a good costume drama love, battles and some rather good acting, then you will not be disappointed.",4,"Whips, Torture, Wigs, Caravaggio and Clockwork Skates!",1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2474,"['film', 'been', 'made', 'Czech', 'Slovak', 'money', 'based', 'Hungary', 'Transylvania', 'served', 'up', 'English', 'welcome', 'new', 'Europe', 'take', 'life', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'lived', 'Hungary', 'sixteenth', 'century', 'gone', 'down', 'history', 'biggest', 'female', 'mass', 'murderer', 'time', 'still', 'credited', 'Guinness', 'Book', 'Records', 'particular', 'title', 'was', 'married', 'early', 'age', 'Prince', 'soon', 'number', 'one', 'lady.They', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'permanently', 'repulsing', 'invasions', 'Moslems', 'Turks', 'power', 'struggles', 'alliances', 'tend', 'ebb', 'flow', 'ferocity', 'invaders', 'attacks', 'also', 'have', 'young', 'Caravaggio', 'who', 'capture', 'Turks', 'who', 'up', 'dipping', 'more', 'paintbrush', 'adding', 'altogether', 'much', 'needed', 'artistic', 'gusto', 'whole', 'proceedings.Anna', 'Friel', 'spot', 'job', 'beautiful', 'believable', 'role', 'however', 'portrayal', 'Bathory', 'Legend', 'killed', 'over', '600', 'virgins', 'bathed', 'blood', 'preserve', 'beauty', 'was', 'bit', 'vampire', 'well', 'would', 'would', ""n't"", 'sort', 'glossed', 'presented', 'herbal', 'bathing', 'Florence', 'Nightingale', 'caused', 'consternation', 'vampire/horror', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'hoping', 'bit', 'more', 'fangs', 'blood', 'Instead', 'have', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'go', 'way', 'Vatican', 'As', 'said', 'film', 'people', 'legends', 'more', 'truth', 'would', 'say', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'then.That', 'said', 'quite', 'bit', 'blood', 'letting', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'good', 'battle', 'scenes', 'great', 'backdrops', 'good', 'cinematography', 'also', 'have', 'witch', 'dream', 'sequences', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'journey', 'madness', 'What', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'dubbing', 'was', 'filmed', 'more', 'one', 'language', 'English', 'dubbed', 'not', 'always', 'obvious', 'sound', 'become', 'bit', 'seventies', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'number', 'occasions', 'pity.That', 'said', 'ambitious', 'evocative', 'movie', 'Director', 'Juraj', 'Jakubisko', 'woven', 'great', 'story', 'told', 'almost', 'beautifully', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'editing', '135', 'minutes', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'say', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'like', 'good', 'costume', 'drama', 'love', 'battles', 'rather', 'good', 'acting', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']","Bathory (2008) ( Untitled Juraj Jakubisko Project ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Spain ]"

Its a great example of sacrificing sumptuous images over characterization.  Actress Anna Friel is excellent as the countess and there is also a surprise cameo from Euro actor Franco Nero but the script tends to lean more to a story of treachery over land ownership and also a psychic form of brainwashing done by an old seer who seems to be the catylist in the blood bathing.  Bathory is portrayed as a character placed in the middle of all this badinage and was wrongly done away with by the boujoir intrigue of the plot.  Director Jurai Jakubisko also introduces a monk and his young apprentice into the mix as the supposed early journalists of this affair who take down all of the events and present it for historic value. The director has them resembling the characters of Sean Connery and Christian Slater in Director Jean Jacque Arnaud's 'THE NAME OF THE ROSE'-1985 and if you want to stretch it a bit further, Jack MacGowran and Director Roman Polanski in his spoof 'THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS'- 1966.  The monk is also portrayed as an early inventor as he escapes from an ambush Da Vinci style in an early form of sky gliding.  The elements in the films favor are the beautiful photography, costumes and sets, and an excellent music score including Simon Boswell in the themes.  The director credits himself as Writer, Director and Painter and rightly so for each frame could be frozen on your monitor and displayed as a painting.  However, all that good stuff can over whelm the viewer. There are some passages which make absolutely no sense or just shown for their audacity to increase the running time causing the characters to become nothing more than card board cut outs and making the actors drown in all of the films beauty .  Director Stanley Kubrick was severely criticized for this exact method when his visual masterpiece 'BARRY LYNDON'- 1975 was released and is still judged to this day.  Screen Media presents it in a beautiful 2.35 transfer and the three stars are for the elements just described. It's like they always say, print the legend instead of the facts.  We cannot go back in time to find out the truth but Director Jakubisko presents an interesting take on Countess Bathory.  Too bad the film has too many ingredients jumbled together that over stay its welcome.",3,Was The Blood Countess A Good Girl?,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,2448,"['Here', 'have', 'take', 'Countess', 'Bathory', 'legend', 'made', 'Czech', 'republic', 'television', 'mini-series', 'served', 'three', 'chapters', 'great', 'example', 'sacrificing', 'sumptuous', 'images', 'characterization', 'Actress', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'excellent', 'countess', 'also', 'surprise', 'cameo', 'Euro', 'actor', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'script', 'lean', 'more', 'story', 'treachery', 'land', 'ownership', 'also', 'psychic', 'form', 'brainwashing', 'done', 'old', 'seer', 'who', 'be', 'catylist', 'blood', 'bathing', 'Bathory', 'portrayed', 'character', 'placed', 'middle', 'badinage', 'was', 'wrongly', 'done', 'away', 'boujoir', 'intrigue', 'plot', 'Director', 'Jurai', 'Jakubisko', 'also', 'monk', 'young', 'apprentice', 'mix', 'supposed', 'early', 'journalists', 'affair', 'who', 'take', 'down', 'events', 'present', 'historic', 'value', 'director', 'resembling', 'characters', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Director', 'Jean', 'Jacque', 'Arnaud', 'NAME', 'THE', ""ROSE'-1985"", 'want', 'stretch', 'bit', 'further', 'Jack', 'MacGowran', 'Director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'spoof', 'FEARLESS', 'VAMPIRE', ""KILLERS'-"", '1966', 'monk', 'also', 'portrayed', 'early', 'inventor', 'ambush', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'style', 'early', 'form', 'sky', 'gliding', 'elements', 'films', 'favor', 'are', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'costumes', 'sets', 'excellent', 'music', 'score', 'including', 'Simon', 'Boswell', 'themes', 'director', 'Writer', 'Director', 'Painter', 'rightly', 'so', 'frame', 'could', 'be', 'frozen', 'monitor', 'displayed', 'painting', 'However', 'good', 'stuff', 'can', 'over', 'whelm', 'viewer', 'are', 'passages', 'make', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'just', 'shown', 'audacity', 'increase', 'running', 'time', 'causing', 'characters', 'become', 'nothing', 'more', 'card', 'board', 'cut', 'outs', 'making', 'actors', 'drown', 'films', 'beauty', 'Director', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'severely', 'criticized', 'exact', 'method', 'when', 'visual', 'masterpiece', ""LYNDON'-"", '1975', 'was', 'released', 'still', 'judged', 'day', 'Screen', 'Media', 'presents', 'beautiful', '2.35', 'transfer', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'elements', 'just', 'described', 'always', 'say', 'print', 'legend', 'instead', 'facts', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'Director', 'Jakubisko', 'interesting', 'take', 'Countess', 'Bathory', 'Too', 'bad', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'ingredients', 'jumbled', 'together', 'stay', 'welcome']","Bathory (2008) ( Untitled Juraj Jakubisko Project ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Spain ]"
