132174,A2582KMXLK2P06,0792165209,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Two things you need to know before watching Deterrence-- One, PLEASE give the movie a chance.  I know the first 30 minutes of film are really boring and feel almost pointless except for everyone in the diner getting to know one another.  Keep waiting, and after 30 minutes the story will build into something almost guaranteed to keep your interest.- The entire movie takes place inside the diner.  If it bothers you that an entire setting sticks to one secluded diner in a small town somewhere in Colorado (and I admit, it bothers me) I hope you're able to look past this and just accept the movie anyway.Alright, Deterrence is about the president of the United States stuck in a diner, and he has to make some life-changing and dramatic decisions concerning Iraq and nuclear missiles.There's just an incredible amount of twists that are both shocking and ones that make you sit and wonder if they could ever really happen.  Actually the film made me wonder just how much secretive information any given president could be keeping to himself.  It makes you wonder at least.There is one exceptionally violent part of the movie that will probably shock you once it happens involving an action scene and guns.  I won't spoil exactly what it is- I want you to find out about it without me spoiling it.Deterrence is all about building suspense and wondering what's going to happen when the president has some tough choices to make all the while stuck inside a small Colorado diner because of a heavy snowstorm taking place outside.  All the key cabinet members and military advisors are with the president helping him make these tough decisions, and a nice little bit of additional story is that the people that actually work at the diner sometimes chip in and give their advice too.What will happen with Iraq and the nuclear missiles that both the Americans and Iraqis have?  Will they be launched?  You have to find out for yourself because I don't wanna spoil it.

It takes the United States' most recent all out military engagement, The Persian Gulf War, and takes the scenario one step further with Sudam Hussein's son, now the dictator of Iraq, invading Kuwait once again.

132177,A9CDS78S3J71G,0792165209,DLU,"[1, 1]","I saw this film many years ago, yet somehow it remained etched in my brain as an excellent film that I wanted to see again (and again).  Kevin Pollak's performance in an dramatic lead role is completely convincing. Those people who know Pollack only as a funny stand-up comic and vocal impressionist are in for an extra special treat.The film's live scenes are staged on a single set -- a typical roadside diner.  Over the length of the film, with cinematic cleverness and imaginative camera angles and lighting, the entire story is told. The President of the US on the road campaigning for re-election is caught in a freak snowstorm.  High winds and low visibility preclude helicopter travel, so POTUS is stuck in the diner.As the President learns of his Colorado victory, and while he waits for snow removal to dig him out of the snow and get him to Air Force One, a critical situation half a world away requires his immediate attention and action. The diner in a matter of just a few short minutes becomes a mobile situation room.  No spoilers here as to what the crisis is, but it is fair to say the threat is nuclear.The film's plot is tight, the script gripping, and the acting impressive. Tim Hutton fans will enjoy his quite convincing slippery campaign manager performance. Other performances, too many to note here, were excellent and well cast. If my memory serves, several of the actors in the film were nominated for supporting actor Oscars.If you are fortunate and purchase the version of the DVD that contains the director's comments, I STRONGLY recommend that you listen to the comments only AFTER you see the movie.  This is one movie where you don't want to create your own spoilers.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 5]","While certainly not the first film of its kind, DETERRENCE accomplishes two feats well:First, the thriller keeps the blood flowing around single-location, almost theatrically-intimate dramas.Second, the film underscores that a post-Cold War world is an increasingly difficult setting for the film industry.Kevin Pollack does an outstanding job playing Walter Emerson, a politician who rose to the position of President after the commander-in-chief passes away.  Trapped in Aztec, Colorado, in the middle of a snowstorm at the height of Presidential primaries, Emerson faces his greatest challenge as king of the free world: how do you stop a Arab dictator from latching control over the flow of oil when all you have in the negotiation process are you own wits?The tension builds as townspeople, gathered in the diner with the snowed-in President, start to watch on television the escalation of a simple military engagement into full-scale nuclear annihiliation.The film's greatest strength lies in Pollack's ability to vascillate between a hard-lined strategist and a slick politician, all the while maintaining a high degree of likeability.  Also, the surprise shocker of an ending doesn't quite deliver the punch that FAILSAFE or TWELVE ANGRY MEN (films alluded to in the product's packaging), but it certainly will keep you talking for hours and it might even prompt a second viewing to see the subtle nuances Pollack added throughout the story to complete his blockbuster performance.Definitely worth a view (rental), DETERRENCE is probably not one to own UNLESS Cold War thrillers make up your entire home video library.",3,Keeping The Cold War Warm,1015286400,"03 5, 2002",2002,1626,"['certainly', 'not', 'first', 'film', 'kind', 'DETERRENCE', 'two', 'feats', 'well', 'First', 'thriller', 'blood', 'flowing', 'single-location', 'almost', 'theatrically-intimate', 'dramas.Second', 'film', 'post-Cold', 'War', 'world', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'setting', 'film', 'industry.Kevin', 'Pollack', 'outstanding', 'job', 'playing', 'Walter', 'Emerson', 'politician', 'who', 'rose', 'position', 'President', 'commander-in-chief', 'passes', 'away', 'Trapped', 'Aztec', 'Colorado', 'middle', 'snowstorm', 'height', 'Presidential', 'primaries', 'Emerson', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'king', 'free', 'world', 'how', 'do', 'stop', 'Arab', 'dictator', 'latching', 'control', 'flow', 'oil', 'when', 'have', 'negotiation', 'process', 'are', 'own', 'wits', 'tension', 'townspeople', 'gathered', 'diner', 'snowed-in', 'President', 'start', 'watch', 'television', 'escalation', 'simple', 'military', 'engagement', 'full-scale', 'nuclear', 'annihiliation.The', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'Pollack', 'ability', 'vascillate', 'hard-lined', 'strategist', 'slick', 'politician', 'while', 'maintaining', 'high', 'degree', 'likeability', 'Also', 'surprise', 'shocker', 'ending', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deliver', 'punch', 'FAILSAFE', 'TWELVE', 'ANGRY', 'MEN', 'films', 'alluded', 'product', 'packaging', 'certainly', 'will', 'keep', 'talking', 'hours', 'might', 'even', 'prompt', 'second', 'viewing', 'see', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'Pollack', 'added', 'story', 'complete', 'blockbuster', 'performance.Definitely', 'view', 'rental', 'DETERRENCE', 'probably', 'not', 'one', 'own', 'UNLESS', 'Cold', 'War', 'thrillers', 'make', 'up', 'entire', 'home', 'video', 'library']",N/A
132181,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0792165209,"""flickjunkie""","[6, 10]","It is the year 2008 and President Emerson is campaigning for the Colorado primary of the upcoming presidential election.  Emerson is an un-elected president, elevated to the presidency when his predecessor died in office and he is having a difficult run in the primaries.  His party is caught in a blizzard and is forced to take shelter in a roadside diner.  Shortly after his arrival, he learns from a television news report that Iraq has invaded Kuwait and the army is on its way to Saudi Arabia in a repeat of the 1991 Gulf War Crisis.Emerson turns the diner into a mobile situation room and assesses the strategic implications.  He is informed that the confidence is high that Iraq has mobile chemical and biological weapons that can be deployed in the next 90 minutes.  To further complicate matters, U.S. forces have been drawn so far down and are so scattered that they can't mount any meaningful response for weeks.  President Emerson makes an executive decision, and after obtaining a live feed, goes on television to announce that if the Republican Guard does not retreat, he will order a nuclear strike on Baghdad in one hour and 20 minutes.Iraq refuses to negotiate with Emerson because he is Jewish.  They then announce that they have more than 20 long-range nuclear weapons that they will launch on cities worldwide like New York, Paris and Tokyo if the B2 bomber enters their airspace.  They also have one targeted at NORAD, which is 40 miles from the president's current location.  This is the setup in this taut international thriller where two intractable leaders stare over the abyss waiting for the other to blink.This is an excellent story that makes nuclear confrontation seem all too plausible in the post cold war era.  Though there are many flaws, the basic concept is sound and frightening, and the nail biting suspense is absorbing and extremely well done.  The likelihood of this scenario can be debated, but there are certain areas where the film comes up short.The film was produced on a shoestring (less than $1M) and it showed.  It had the feel of a TV movie.  The camera work was mediocre at best with numerous shots poorly framed. The camera operator often had trouble following the movement of actors.  The news reports were also unrealistic.One plot element was inconceivable.  The entire idea that the five citizens in the diner would be allowed to stay and witness the president's decision making process during a national security crisis is ludicrous.  That would be like inviting people from the White House tour into the Oval Office during such an event.  Some arrangement would be made to sequester these people.  They would have been locked in the kitchen or told to sit in their cars until the crisis abated.The acting of the major players was very good.  Kevin Pollack gave one of his best performances to date as the president without a mandate.  He was strong, tough and resolute and took complete command of the situation.  Timothy Hutton was also excellent as the chief of staff, always buzzing around the president giving him new angles to consider and often overstepping his authority.  Sheryl Lee Ralph gave a strong performance as the president's national security advisor and was strident and insistent about her opinion, which was in direct opposition to the president's decision.Despite its shortcomings, this film presented a tense and engrossing story that was within the realm of possibility, making it that much more interesting and terrifying.  I rated it an 8/10.  It definitely rises above its humble budget and is worth hunting down in the rental stacks.",4,"Great story, mediocre production",970617600,"10 4, 2000",2000,3618,"['year', '2008', 'President', 'Emerson', 'campaigning', 'Colorado', 'primary', 'upcoming', 'presidential', 'election', 'Emerson', 'un-elected', 'president', 'elevated', 'presidency', 'when', 'predecessor', 'died', 'office', 'having', 'difficult', 'run', 'primaries', 'party', 'caught', 'blizzard', 'forced', 'take', 'shelter', 'roadside', 'diner', 'Shortly', 'arrival', 'television', 'news', 'report', 'Iraq', 'invaded', 'Kuwait', 'army', 'way', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'repeat', '1991', 'Gulf', 'War', 'Crisis.Emerson', 'diner', 'mobile', 'situation', 'room', 'strategic', 'implications', 'informed', 'confidence', 'high', 'Iraq', 'mobile', 'chemical', 'biological', 'weapons', 'can', 'be', 'deployed', 'next', '90', 'minutes', 'further', 'complicate', 'matters', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'so', 'far', 'down', 'are', 'so', 'scattered', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mount', 'meaningful', 'response', 'weeks', 'President', 'Emerson', 'executive', 'decision', 'obtaining', 'live', 'feed', 'television', 'announce', 'Republican', 'Guard', 'not', 'retreat', 'will', 'order', 'nuclear', 'strike', 'Baghdad', 'one', 'hour', '20', 'minutes.Iraq', 'refuses', 'negotiate', 'Emerson', 'Jewish', 'then', 'announce', 'have', 'more', '20', 'long-range', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'will', 'launch', 'cities', 'worldwide', 'New', 'York', 'Paris', 'Tokyo', 'B2', 'bomber', 'enters', 'airspace', 'also', 'have', 'one', 'targeted', 'NORAD', '40', 'miles', 'president', 'current', 'location', 'setup', 'taut', 'international', 'thriller', 'where', 'two', 'intractable', 'leaders', 'stare', 'abyss', 'waiting', 'other', 'blink.This', 'excellent', 'story', 'nuclear', 'confrontation', 'seem', 'too', 'plausible', 'post', 'cold', 'war', 'era', 'are', 'many', 'flaws', 'basic', 'concept', 'sound', 'frightening', 'nail', 'biting', 'suspense', 'absorbing', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'likelihood', 'scenario', 'can', 'be', 'debated', 'are', 'certain', 'areas', 'where', 'film', 'up', 'short.The', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'shoestring', 'less', '1M', 'showed', 'had', 'feel', 'TV', 'movie', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', 'numerous', 'shots', 'poorly', 'framed', 'camera', 'operator', 'often', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'movement', 'actors', 'news', 'reports', 'were', 'also', 'unrealistic.One', 'plot', 'element', 'was', 'inconceivable', 'entire', 'idea', 'five', 'citizens', 'diner', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'stay', 'witness', 'president', 'decision', 'making', 'process', 'national', 'security', 'crisis', 'ludicrous', 'would', 'be', 'inviting', 'people', 'White', 'House', 'tour', 'Oval', 'Office', 'event', 'arrangement', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'sequester', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'locked', 'kitchen', 'told', 'sit', 'cars', 'crisis', 'abated.The', 'acting', 'major', 'players', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'date', 'president', 'mandate', 'was', 'strong', 'tough', 'resolute', 'took', 'complete', 'command', 'situation', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'chief', 'staff', 'always', 'buzzing', 'president', 'giving', 'new', 'angles', 'consider', 'often', 'overstepping', 'authority', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'Ralph', 'gave', 'strong', 'performance', 'president', 'national', 'security', 'advisor', 'was', 'strident', 'insistent', 'opinion', 'was', 'direct', 'opposition', 'president', 'decision.Despite', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'presented', 'tense', 'engrossing', 'story', 'was', 'realm', 'possibility', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'terrifying', 'rated', '8/10', 'definitely', 'humble', 'budget', 'worth', 'hunting', 'down', 'rental', 'stacks']",N/A

It was apparently a rental in it's earlier life and had some light scratches, but it played all the way through without a hitch.The movie was highly suspenseful all the way through.

132185,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0792165209,Jeffrey Leach,"[9, 13]","About the only thing more enjoyable than a post-apocalyptic film is a movie about the lead up to the end of the world. &quot;Deterrence&quot; recalls &quot;Fail Safe,&quot; &quot;Dr. Strangelove,&quot; &quot;By Dawn's Early Light,&quot; or a host of other &quot;when nukes go wild&quot; type films. Well, almost. Only one bomb goes off here, after which Armageddon is put off for a sunnier day. But the tension so intrinsic to this amazing genre is here in spades, that special, palpable tension so thick you could spackle the cracks in your ceiling with it. &quot;Deterrence&quot; is a nice nail biter with a solid cast, a claustrophobic atmosphere, and an effective cast to carry the whole thing off. It's too bad this movie is such an obscurity; I would like to state that &quot;Deterrence&quot; deserves more attention than it has currently received. Moreover, with the end of the Cold War we just do not see films like this anymore. Anyone who grew up during the days of mutually assured destruction policies and doomsday planes swooping over the roofs of their houses at fifteen-minute intervals will probably appreciate the implications of this movie more than those youngsters born after Ronald Reagan was president.It is the future (2008, to be exact) when President Walter Emerson (Kevin Pollack) stops over at a little diner in Colorado during a snowstorm. Conditions are so bad outside that the man cannot even get a helicopter in to transport him out of the area. Emerson is pounding the pavement around the country in order to secure his party's nomination for a run at the White House. He is president, but only because he assumed the office after his predecessor suddenly died. The political battle is close, and it will soon get much closer when an international tragedy of epic dimensions erupts in the Middle East. While Emerson schmoozes with a few of the people trapped in the diner, his aides make the shocking announcement that Saddam Hussein's son, now the leader of Iraq, has launched a surprise attack on Kuwait and wiped out a contingent of U.S. Marines stationed there. Even worse, Iraq claims to possess nuclear weapons and threatens to unleash a holocaust of unprecedented proportions if Emerson attempts to dislodge the Iraqi army now ravaging Kuwait. The president is in a quandary; he must consider his response in terms of the upcoming election, but he must also deal decisively with the Iraqi situation with only a few laptop computers and a satellite phone at his disposal. Serving as the leader of the free world can really drag.Incredibly, President Emerson uses a news crew following his campaign to make a live newscast to the nation where he threatens to drop an atomic device on Baghdad within a few hours if the Iraqi leadership fails to withdraw its troops. The prez doesn't stonewall, doesn't beg for more time to consider his options, doesn't check polls before making a decision; he steps right up to the camera, delivers his ultimatum, and begins to monitor the situation. What leadership! What chutzpah! Well, that is the problem. Emerson's Chief of Staff Marshall Thompson (Timothy Hutton) occasionally drifts into the foreground to question the motivations of such a brazen decree. He points out that nuking Baghdad is equivalent to dropping a bomb on the birthplace of the human race. Thompson also wonders about the potential fallout sure to batter the gates when Emerson, a Jew, attacks an Arab nation with such a devastating device. Further complicating matters are a series of increasingly irate phone calls between the president and the Iraqi ambassador, communications that take on downright sinister implications when the Iraqi's claim to possess a bundle of nuclear weapons located on ships around the world. They will launch these bombs at American targets, says the ambassador, unless Emerson accepts the invasion. Predictably, one of these targets is Washington, D.C. where the president's family waits for his return.If you cannot tell, I liked &quot;Deterrence.&quot; I started out with doubts as I loaded the DVD in the machine, however. I worried about Kevin Pollack turning in a competent performance as the president, a worry completely unfounded as the first few minutes of the movie unfolded. What really gave me a positive feel for the guy was how he worked the locals at the diner. Anyone who has seen a politician in action will instantly recognize Emerson's breezy familiarity with people he met mere seconds ago. I thought these initial scenes really helped set up the idea of Pollack playing the president. Who knew a comedian who does such a killer impression of William Shatner's Captain Kirk could pull off a role requiring him to resolve more moral dilemmas than Plato? For the most part, the supporting cast does an adequate job backing up Pollack's essentially one-man show. What didn't work as well was the cast of locals in the diner. For a large part of the movie they simply fade into the woodwork until one of the shocking twists at the conclusion requires their presence.Anyone who says they saw the twist conclusion coming from miles away is not telling the truth. Although this denouement is arguably too pat, it did instantly change the entire scope of the film. There is that great moment when you learn why the president does what he does and you quickly scan your memory of the preceding scenes in order to see what clues the director gave you in advance. They are there, but you won't see them until the very end. As for the DVD version of &quot;Deterrence,&quot; there is a commentary track from the director but that's about it. No matter, though, since &quot;Deterrence&quot; is a great thriller and a grand continuation of a genre that could have disappeared with the Berlin Wall.

132186,A2DSXA1E02C86D,0792165209,Joseph Haschka,"[3, 8]","I'm having difficulty deciding whether I liked DETERRENCE or not. The concept is promising, but the execution flawed.Kevin Pollack plays Walter Emerson, recently vaulted from U.S. Vice President to President after the death of the latter. (My immediate reaction was to wonder what presidential candidate would pick such a physically unprepossessing running mate. No savvy politician would do that! Then, I thought of the recent campaign.) Emerson is now running for election on his own merits. While stumping Colorado during that state's primary, he, his executive staff, and the security team take refuge from a blizzard in a rural greasy spoon, already containing its black cook/owner, a French Canadian waitress, a middle-aged WASPish couple playing chess, and a male rustic shooting pool. Shortly after ordering burgers and coffee, the President is informed by an on-screen TV news personality that Sadam Hussein's son, now the Great Leader after the death of the Old Man, has invaded Kuwait. Almost immediately, Emerson broadcasts to America his intention to nuke Baghdad unless the Iraqis withdraw and Hussein personally surrender himself to an American embassy. (Yeah, that's gonna happen!) In response, the Iraqi's Washington ambassador vows retaliation with twenty-some missiles carrying nuclear warheads - bombs purchased from one of its European pals. As proof of nuclear capability, he provides the co-ordinates of the launch sites, subsequently confirmed by U.S. intelligence. Thus begins the global game of chicken.I guess I fell into the trap of comparing DETERRENCE with the original FAIL-SAFE, which exercise makes the former look all the more droll. To be fair, Timothy Hutton (as Emerson's chief of staff) and Sheryl Lee Ralph (as the National Security Advisor) are quite good in their performances, especially Ralph. However, Pollack's role as a Chief Executive with Short Man's Syndrome trying too hard to stand up to the malevolent Iraqis is stretched beyond credibility by the fact that his character is also Jewish. And, surely the most uncomfortable moment was Emerson's awkward attempt to engage the waitress in a theological discussion. The last time I'd seen Sean Astin was in 1993's RUDY, in which he was terrific... I would've expected Astin to graduate to more mature roles, but in DETERRENCE he seems to have sadly regressed, playing the local, pool-playing redneck. The other shut-ins, the black cook and the WASP couple, should have kept silent and out of sight.The ending of this movie being what it is, the film almost works better as a doomsday parody. I mean, c'mon, would the French co-operate with the United States to that extent? They hate everybody, and particularly America ever since the first McDonald's sullied the City of Light. Admittedly, the movie kept my attention to its conclusion, but it was more out of a dull fascination waiting to see if it would get any better.",3,Inspires a dull fascination,981417600,"02 6, 2001",2001,2920,"[""'m"", 'having', 'difficulty', 'deciding', 'liked', 'DETERRENCE', 'not', 'concept', 'promising', 'execution', 'Pollack', 'Walter', 'Emerson', 'recently', 'vaulted', 'U.S.', 'Vice', 'President', 'President', 'death', 'latter', 'immediate', 'reaction', 'was', 'wonder', 'what', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'would', 'pick', 'physically', 'unprepossessing', 'running', 'mate', 'savvy', 'politician', 'would', 'do', 'Then', 'thought', 'recent', 'campaign', 'Emerson', 'now', 'running', 'election', 'own', 'merits', 'stumping', 'Colorado', 'state', 'primary', 'executive', 'staff', 'security', 'team', 'take', 'refuge', 'blizzard', 'rural', 'greasy', 'spoon', 'already', 'containing', 'black', 'cook/owner', 'French', 'Canadian', 'waitress', 'middle-aged', 'WASPish', 'couple', 'playing', 'chess', 'male', 'rustic', 'shooting', 'pool', 'Shortly', 'ordering', 'burgers', 'coffee', 'President', 'informed', 'on-screen', 'TV', 'news', 'personality', 'Sadam', 'Hussein', 'son', 'now', 'Great', 'Leader', 'death', 'Old', 'Man', 'invaded', 'Kuwait', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'Emerson', 'America', 'intention', 'nuke', 'Baghdad', 'Iraqis', 'withdraw', 'Hussein', 'personally', 'American', 'embassy', 'Yeah', 'gon', 'happen', 'response', 'Iraqi', 'Washington', 'ambassador', 'retaliation', 'twenty-some', 'missiles', 'carrying', 'nuclear', 'warheads', 'bombs', 'purchased', 'one', 'European', 'pals', 'proof', 'nuclear', 'capability', 'co-ordinates', 'launch', 'subsequently', 'confirmed', 'U.S.', 'intelligence', 'Thus', 'global', 'game', 'chicken.I', 'guess', 'fell', 'trap', 'comparing', 'DETERRENCE', 'original', 'FAIL-SAFE', 'exercise', 'former', 'look', 'more', 'droll', 'be', 'fair', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Emerson', 'chief', 'staff', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'Ralph', 'National', 'Security', 'Advisor', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'performances', 'especially', 'Ralph', 'However', 'Pollack', 'role', 'Chief', 'Executive', 'Short', 'Man', 'Syndrome', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'stand', 'up', 'malevolent', 'Iraqis', 'stretched', 'credibility', 'fact', 'character', 'also', 'Jewish', 'surely', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'moment', 'was', 'Emerson', 'awkward', 'attempt', 'engage', 'waitress', 'theological', 'discussion', 'last', 'time', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'was', '1993', 'RUDY', 'was', 'terrific', 'would', ""'ve"", 'expected', 'Astin', 'graduate', 'more', 'mature', 'roles', 'DETERRENCE', 'have', 'sadly', 'regressed', 'playing', 'local', 'pool-playing', 'redneck', 'other', 'shut-ins', 'black', 'cook', 'WASP', 'couple', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'silent', 'sight.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'being', 'what', 'film', 'almost', 'better', 'doomsday', 'parody', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'would', 'French', 'co-operate', 'United', 'States', 'extent', 'hate', 'everybody', 'particularly', 'America', 'ever', 'first', 'McDonald', 'sullied', 'City', 'Light', 'Admittedly', 'movie', 'kept', 'attention', 'conclusion', 'was', 'more', 'dull', 'fascination', 'waiting', 'see', 'would', 'get', 'better']",N/A

I may be slightly paraphrasing, but those were the words of a B-2 Spirit Stealth bomber pilot as he spoke to the President from the skies above Iraq.This is a very well-conceived movie and the superb Kevin Pollak was a great choice as the Pres. If I have a criticism at all, it is that the movie suggests that the reason the US could not engage the invading Iraqi army is that most of their troops were positioned to deal with North Korea at that time.This is unlikely, as the Korean situation is very simple, in that there is an infinitely greater chance that the US would use Tac Nukes against any invading force as a first resort. If North Korea ever began a barrage of the South Korean capital (a city of 10 million people), they would be able to effectively destroy it with conventional rockets and shells during the first 24-48 hours, causing millions of casualties.There is no doubt in the minds of any military analysts that the US would have to go nuclear and on a massive scale well within the first two hours. While the North Korean capital would almost certainly receive a 'deterrence'-style surrender or die message from the US, the main thrust would be the large scale use of heavy tactical and even strategic nuclear weapons against the launch areas for the rocket tubes etc., many of which have been embedded to make them difficult to bomb. Neutron weapons would be one of the most effective responses for this type of target.Not a pleasant topic and one that we all hope will remain in the realms of the theoretical, but then again, that's up to the North Korean leader.Deterrence captures the life or death nature of this kind of diplomacy and is an important reminder of the stakes involved.The only other criticism is that (Don't read on if you don't want to know anything about the film, I'm about to mention a plot event...) when the diner owner shoots and wounds the military aide carrying the briefcase containing the launch codes, there is NO WAY the Security people would stand there, pointing their guns at him trying to talk him down and risk that he will fire a fatal shot, thus making it impossible to open the briefcase. The guy would have been tomato paste after getting off the first round.All in all a great movie.

132192,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,0792165209,T.M. Reader,"[3, 3]","As I write this, this film is over six years old and turns out to be remarkably prophetic.  It's a relatively low budget piece, taking place on a single set in a diner, where the President has been stranded with a few staff members and a few odd customers.  The President is forced to deal with a Middle East flare up involving Iraq and nuclear weapons . . . not Iran, but close enough to give one pause considering the current world scene.This is indeed a ""thinking person's"" feast. Without picking apart the various production shortcomings (the worst was the overplayed ""Redneck"" customer in the diner), the crux of the film is what happens when America's nuclear hegemony evaporates in the face of the emergence of an equally devastating force . . . and the will to use it.  America's response will be greatly colored by the personal character of the President.I won't dicuss any more of the story so as not to ruin the film for anyone that hasn't seen it.  Give this a try.

132193,A1VMIBRD783JX9,0792165209,Tom Gray,"[1, 6]","Much of this movie has already been made before in the much better movies 'Fail Safe' and 'Doctor Strangelove.' The similarity between this movie and 'Fail Safe' is striking.Both are concerned with the need to make irreversible decisions in  a world controlled in large part by chance. By and large, 'Fail Safe' is much more successful in doing this with Henry Fonda as the president much more successful as a rational man  trying to control irrational events. Walter Matthau in 'Fail Safe' portrays the type of shallow intellectualism that pervades 'Deterrence.' The Matthau character is a clever intellectual and is full of shallow analysis and post facto rationalizations that entirely miss the point of the events that are happening around him. The real point is that there is no rationality and that there can be no predictions or long range control. Leaders can only deal with problems as they present themselves and hope that they have enough ingenuity to steer the course of events away from immediate disaster.'Deterrence' misses that point but does a reasonably good job of showing the isolation of the decision maker.A very disturbing gaffe occurs late in the movie with stock footage of a hydrogen bomb explosion in the Pacific standing in  for the destruction of Baghdad. Ships are clearly visible in the shot. For a period before that point the movie was very gripping with the tension of the irrevesible decision to drop the bomb. The unfortunate choice of stock footage tends to spoil the end of the movie.",3,Derivative but Very  Interesting At Times,978220800,"12 31, 2000",2000,1522,"['Much', 'movie', 'already', 'been', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'movies', ""'Fail"", 'Safe', 'Strangelove', 'similarity', 'movie', 'Safe', 'striking.Both', 'are', 'concerned', 'need', 'make', 'irreversible', 'decisions', 'world', 'controlled', 'large', 'part', 'chance', 'large', ""'Fail"", 'Safe', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'doing', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'president', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'rational', 'man', 'trying', 'control', 'irrational', 'events', 'Walter', 'Matthau', ""'Fail"", 'Safe', 'type', 'shallow', 'intellectualism', ""'Deterrence"", 'Matthau', 'character', 'clever', 'intellectual', 'full', 'shallow', 'analysis', 'post', 'facto', 'rationalizations', 'entirely', 'miss', 'point', 'events', 'are', 'happening', 'real', 'point', 'rationality', 'can', 'be', 'predictions', 'long', 'range', 'control', 'Leaders', 'can', 'only', 'deal', 'problems', 'present', 'hope', 'have', 'enough', 'ingenuity', 'steer', 'course', 'events', 'away', 'immediate', 'disaster', ""'Deterrence"", 'misses', 'point', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'isolation', 'decision', 'maker.A', 'very', 'disturbing', 'gaffe', 'late', 'movie', 'stock', 'footage', 'hydrogen', 'bomb', 'explosion', 'Pacific', 'standing', 'destruction', 'Baghdad', 'Ships', 'are', 'clearly', 'visible', 'shot', 'period', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'gripping', 'tension', 'irrevesible', 'decision', 'drop', 'bomb', 'unfortunate', 'choice', 'stock', 'footage', 'spoil', 'end', 'movie']",N/A

Boosting no blockbuster stars and a rather small budget it didn't have much of a theatrical release. However, thanks to VHS and DVD, this movie is sure to have a long life.The movie takes place in a small diner in Aztec, Colorado in the year 2008. The non-elected President Emerson (he took office after the former elected President died in office) is heavily campaigning in the hope of becoming &quot;legit&quot; and needs a major victory. Emerson and company are stuck at the diner because of a major snowstorm that prevents all travel. While there, it is learned that the son of Saddam Hussein (now the leader of Iraq) has invaded Kuwait and is preparing to invade Saudi Arabia as well. Hundreds of American soldiers have been killed in the process and the threat from Iraq could lead to a nuclear holocaust. The momentum of the movie builds from that point on as we are drawn into the interactions between Emerson and his staff and the response of the diner's customers.The strength of this film is it's dialogue. You have to turn up the volume otherwise you might miss something.  Though there are no major blockbuster stars (Kevin Pollock is a great actor, but doesn't make blockbuster movies), the acting is superb and is better than many big budget pictures.The movie only has two flaws. One of them really isn't even a flaw, just a drawback. The movie works and moves well, but would work even better as a play or live television broadcast. Much of the energy derived from a live audience is lost because of the indifference of the camera lens, but that is something beyond the filmmaker's control. The only other complaint is the ending of the film. The entire movie seems realistic and totally plausible, but the climax of the film is rather anti-dramatic for such a gut-wrenching pace. Nevertheless, the film is so powerful and thought-provoking that, though the finale leaves something to be desired it doesn't ruin the movie.
