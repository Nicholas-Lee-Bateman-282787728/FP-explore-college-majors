For this edition, you have 16 of the original 22 episodes of Season 3 on two dual sided discs.If you really want to see Season 3 (all 22 episodes), then I recommend Echo Bridge's PSI Factor Season 3.  With that set, you get the episodes spread out across 5 single sided discs.I really can't imagine the purpose of this release, other than to make money.

The stories are very badly written, the cast is terrible and totally unappealing, the production is cheap ...so my advise is: Don't waste your money in this nonsense and get the X-files, The Ray Bradbury Show or even the Twilight Zone from the eighties which are way better than this. I still don't understand why the producers of the show picked these actors for the series. They are not only bad actors but they don't have the slightest trace of charisma. Then the dialogues are aweful and the situations around the main story are ridiculous. I paid $7.50 for this set and I feel like I was ripped off. Oh, I forgot ...with all this CGI technology we have now these guys still use rubber models and cheap make up. It seems that we're looking Sci Fi from the eithies or even seventies.
