Other reviewers have offered details on the casts and action. I can only second the rave reviews they give: this four film set gives us two George Montgomery color classics, including what may be his best outing, GUN BELT, an unheralded Rory Calhoun oater (RIDE OUT FOR REVENGE), and a fine Joel McCrea vehicle (GUNSIGHT RIDGE), these latter two in great black & white prints. These films were released by United Artists/MGM, and Shout! Factory has apparently secured DVD release rights from them. The result is a delight, highly recommended for those (like me) who cannot get enough of good, ole' Western action! Perhaps the folks at Shout! Factory will locate some other fine Westerns (from the 1950s?) to release. There are a goodly number still in the vaults. In any case, don't hesitate on this one...picture quality on each of the four is just fine.",5,Fine 1950s Westerns at a great price,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,973,"['set', 'four', 'fine', 'little', 'Westerns', '1950s', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'price', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'offered', 'details', 'casts', 'action', 'can', 'only', 'second', 'rave', 'give', 'four', 'film', 'set', 'two', 'George', 'Montgomery', 'color', 'classics', 'including', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'outing', 'GUN', 'BELT', 'unheralded', 'Rory', 'Calhoun', 'oater', 'RIDE', 'OUT', 'FOR', 'REVENGE', 'fine', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'vehicle', 'GUNSIGHT', 'RIDGE', 'latter', 'two', 'great', 'black', 'white', 'prints', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'United', 'Artists/MGM', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'apparently', 'secured', 'DVD', 'release', 'rights', 'result', 'delight', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'good', 'ole', 'Western', 'action', 'Perhaps', 'folks', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'will', 'locate', 'other', 'fine', 'Westerns', '1950s', 'release', 'are', 'goodly', 'number', 'still', 'vaults', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'one', 'picture', 'quality', 'four', 'just', 'fine']","Movies 4 You: Western Classics (The Lone Gun, Ride Out For Revenge, Gunsight Ridge & Gun Belt)"

Two are in color and they are also very fine prints though now and then a bit unsharp. These kind of westerns which dominated the fifties and were the kind they showed in sunday matinee theaters in Denmark, Europe when I was a kid are not big budget John Ford films. Neither are they b-westerns like those starring Bob Steele, Buck Jones, Tom Tyler and many, many more ( I think b-westerns are the most charming of westerns ). No, they are something in between, some call them middle budget westerns and they certainly can be great too. &#34;Ride out for Revenge&#34; with Rory Calhoun is a bit weak because it tackles with the serious historical problem of moving the Cheyennes from their home country to Oklahoma and that is too much for the genre. But enjoy Lloyd Bridges as a drinking cowardly officer. The other three films are super. Enjoy Joel McCrea's usual calm authority in &#34;Gunsight Ridge&#34; and be thrilled by the two high action westerns starring George Montgomery who is up against such heavies as William Bishop ( what a great psycho ) and Neville Brand.
