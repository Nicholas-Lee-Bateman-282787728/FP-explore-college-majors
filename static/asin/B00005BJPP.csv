581473,AVZUVRF7MFS24,B00005BJPP,David S. Jenkins,"[44, 53]","Three things save this DVD fom the trashcan - one is the selection of KQED-TV black and white performances (although the whole show is available on VHS). Two are the very interesting films of the band recording ""Summertime"" in the studio for the Cheap Thrills album. Three of course is Janis. She shines. For those who only know her visually from still photos and the Monterey Pop film, you may find yourself surprised at how very attractive she is in every way. Still photos never did her justice.Unfortunately, beyond these three saving graces this hour long documentary is lackluster, managing to make this incredibly exciting period of American rock and roll just plain boring, along with the social revolution which fed it. Most of the band's performances within the documentary are nothing short of embarrassing, PROFOUNDLY bad, bad guitar, bad bass, bad backing vocals, and just sloppy timing. When this is accompanied by lifeless modern interviews with the band, it's tough to find pleasure on this disc. It comes across, I'm sad to say, as grown men whining incessantly about how nobody liked them and everyone liked Janis more.Even though I've always regarded the band's live playing on Cheap Thrills and an alternate evening's performance which is out there someplace on CD as being brilliant, my opinion of Big Brother's abilities (and personal character) has shrunk mightily after watching 900 Nights. All bands have bad nights, and have bad recordings out there in circulation - most Airplane live recordings are pretty scary, but nothing like what we have here. One would have had to look very hard for performance clips that made the band sound worse.The black cherry on the sour whipped cream is found in the extras, where each band member is asked how he heard about Janis' death. Peter Albin's and James Gurley's responses are bloodless and shameful. Honest perhaps, but show a little class guys. Remember that you're part of a legendary band for one reason and one reason alone. If it wasn't for that one particular lady, no one would know your names. Stop whining. Get over it. You got fired because you were a pretty lousy band who couldn't keep time or play decent solos. The Cheap Thrills album sounds like another band, frankly.",2,"Stop Sulking, Boys",1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2253,"['Three', 'things', 'save', 'DVD', 'trashcan', 'one', 'selection', 'KQED-TV', 'black', 'white', 'performances', 'whole', 'show', 'available', 'VHS', 'Two', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'films', 'band', 'recording', 'Summertime', 'studio', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', 'album', 'Three', 'course', 'Janis', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'visually', 'still', 'photos', 'Monterey', 'Pop', 'film', 'may', 'find', 'surprised', 'how', 'very', 'attractive', 'way', 'Still', 'photos', 'never', 'did', 'justice.Unfortunately', 'three', 'saving', 'graces', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'lackluster', 'managing', 'make', 'incredibly', 'exciting', 'period', 'American', 'rock', 'roll', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'social', 'revolution', 'fed', 'Most', 'band', 'performances', 'documentary', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'embarrassing', 'PROFOUNDLY', 'bad', 'bad', 'guitar', 'bad', 'bass', 'bad', 'backing', 'vocals', 'just', 'sloppy', 'timing', 'When', 'accompanied', 'lifeless', 'modern', 'interviews', 'band', 'tough', 'find', 'pleasure', 'disc', ""'m"", 'sad', 'say', 'grown', 'men', 'whining', 'incessantly', 'how', 'nobody', 'liked', 'everyone', 'liked', 'Janis', 'more.Even', ""'ve"", 'always', 'regarded', 'band', 'live', 'playing', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', 'alternate', 'evening', 'performance', 'there', 'someplace', 'CD', 'being', 'brilliant', 'opinion', 'Big', 'Brother', 'abilities', 'personal', 'character', 'shrunk', 'mightily', 'watching', '900', 'Nights', 'bands', 'have', 'bad', 'nights', 'have', 'bad', 'recordings', 'out', 'there', 'circulation', 'most', 'Airplane', 'live', 'recordings', 'are', 'pretty', 'scary', 'nothing', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'look', 'very', 'hard', 'performance', 'clips', 'made', 'band', 'sound', 'worse.The', 'black', 'cherry', 'sour', 'whipped', 'cream', 'found', 'extras', 'where', 'band', 'member', 'asked', 'how', 'heard', 'Janis', 'death', 'Peter', 'Albin', 'James', 'Gurley', 'responses', 'are', 'bloodless', 'shameful', 'Honest', 'perhaps', 'show', 'little', 'class', 'guys', 'Remember', ""'re"", 'part', 'legendary', 'band', 'one', 'reason', 'one', 'reason', 'alone', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'particular', 'lady', 'one', 'would', 'know', 'names', 'Stop', 'whining', 'Get', 'got', 'fired', 'were', 'pretty', 'lousy', 'band', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'time', 'play', 'decent', 'solos', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', 'album', 'sounds', 'band', 'frankly']",N/A

It is told by members of the band themselves. It also, covers some of the 1960's San Francisco ""scene"" (to a certain extent). It does include ""Live"" footage of the late/great legendary Janis Joplin performing, with the band.And most of all, it covers the ""Texas Tornado"" herself - the late/great Janis Joplin, from Port Authur, Texas!!! She joined the ""Big Brother & the Holding Company"" Band.The total running time is approximately 148 minutes. There are performances during the ""documentary"" portion of the dvd. Plus, you get performances featuring Janis Joplin in the bonus features of the DVD.The bonus performances include: (I think the first one is ""Down on Me"" - its not listed as a bonus performance on the back of the dvd package, but it is included. Next, you get complete bonus performances of ""The Coo Coo"", ""Ball & Chain"", and the outstanding ""Piece of My Heart"". Janis had an excellent ""blues"" voice. These performances are a real treat!!! Plus, you get some more bonus material.Overall, this is a great dvd. Even though it covers the story of Big Brother and the Holding Company, it does contain a substantual amount of Janis Joplin. The bonus complete performances are worth the price of the DVD, just to watch Janis sing. This is a ""must-have"" for any Janis Joplin fan, and I'm a fan. I think she was one of the greatest ""blues"" singers of all time.For me this is a 5 star DVD, mainly, because I like Janis, but I also like the story of ""Big Brother & the Holding Company"" because this band was a part of Janis Joplin's history. If you're looking for a full concert DVD, this is not the DVD for you. However, if you like Janis, then you'll like this one. This is probably the best dvd out there about Janis and her performances are outstanding!!! So, if you like what I have described you'll probably like this one. Thanks!!!!P.S. I would like to add that after Janis left The Big Brother & The Holding Company band, she went on to record & perform with the Kozmic Blues Band (this band included trumpets & a saxaphone player). Then she went on to record & perform with her last band, The Full Tilt Boogie Band.Her big hit ""Me & Bobby McGee"" was recorded with the Full Tilt Boogie Band. There is a DVD of Janis performing with these 2 other bands, but its hard to find. It's entitled ""The Best of Janis Joplin"".

The only problem is that when all the talking is done it was really the music that mattered and there is little of that here. The clips are just long enough to be frustrating. janis was great but through the years Big Brother has gotten the short end of the stick. Sure they were rough & could be sloppy by todays standard but there are some things to consider that made most of the bands, be it The dead, Buffalo Springfield,The Byrds, Jefferson Airplane to The monkees and even the Beatles, something less that stellar in performance. Stage monitors were either very poor or non existant. Another this is that electronic tuners weren't around yet. Have you ever tried to tune an electric guitar on stage with a pitch pipe?  Another thing is that35 years after the passing of Janis Big Brother is still performing and touring the world.

Unfortunately, the sound quality is overall very poor, and the images are often washed out.  This is especially noticeable because much of the same footage has been used in such other films as JANIS, MONTEREY POP, BIG BROTHER : BALL AND CHAIN, and various TV specials (A&E;, Biography, VH1 and so on) so comparisons are too easy to make.  I have reissues of 78 rpm vinyl records on CD that have been digitally restored to offer clearer sound than this DVD, and have seen silent movie images similarly restored, so I can only surmise that this documentary was hastily thrown together with an eye to the fast buck and not much concern for production quality.That being said, the DVD does offer a fascinating look at the band members then and now.  Some of them look back on the Psychedelic Era with nostalgic fondness, while others have obviously been clinging to and rehearsing their grudges for the last 40 years.  If they'd never met Janis Joplin, Big Brother's story might have been very different -- whether nobody would ever have heard of them, or whether they'd have made it big on their own raw-edged, bluesy terms,  we'll never know.

581482,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,B00005BJPP,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[1, 1]","One of an interminable string of documentaries about San Francisco and the hippy scene, this one documents the formation of an eccentric psychedelic rock band Big Brother And The Holding Company and some of the work that they did putting together a sloppy, soulful rock unit that eventually hooked up with a young singer from Texas called Janis Joplin, a gifted singer who had once been called ""the ugliest man on campus"" at her university. They put out two albums and started getting some attention. Then they played the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, where they hung out with Los Angeles pop musicians like the Mamas and the Papas, as well as Jim Hendrix, Brian Jones, and Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. Showing San Francisco music to the country for the first time, the band made a bad career move by refusing to sign away film permission for free and lost their place in history; Janis, however, did sign, and the film is only of her, making it look like Big Brother And The Holding Company were really only her backup band. Well... she probably was the most talented member of the band, as evidenced by the fact that none of the other members went on to make much of a mark after the band broke up later that year. To mark the point, the surviving members of the band talk about recording ""Cheap Thrills"", the band's second album, for a big studio and with a proper recording budget, and how the band would sweat for hours to lay down a basic track, only to watch Janis  stroll in and do her vocals in one or two takes.The documentary is quite good, covering a lot of history and emotions, and the extras are really great too. There are four full performances from three parts of the band's career, a photo gallery, and interview outtakes with the four surviving members of the band, New York rock critic Ellen Willis, rock historian (and guitarist for the Patty Smith Group) Lenny Kaye, as well as Nick Gravenites, who wrote songs for Janis and also appeared in Big Brother and the Holding Company. Seeing interviews with the four surviving members of Big Brother and the Holding company is interesting. You get to appreciate the intelligence of drummer David Getz, who came off as a bit of a dummy in the historical footage, and the aloofness of ""star"" guitarist James Gurley, whose star had been outshone by Joplin when she joined the band (Gurley died last week, on December 20th, after having survived the heroin overdose death of his wife in 1970 and years of hard rock `n' roll living). All members are asked ""where were you when you heard that Janis had died?""  It seems like they all heard from the same roadie, and they reacted in different ways, with Gurley being quite cool about it; no one was surprised, but only Sam Andrew - the rhythm guitarist who left Big Brother And The Holding Company with Janis to be part of her new Kozmic Blues Band - showed any real emotion.Lenny Kaye's highly engaging interviews are the best in the collection, and he talks about the band with great reverence, as they seemed like the San Francisco band that he was most interested in seeing when he travelled across the country to join the scene in 1967. He had interesting tales to tell about his cross-country trip, about the scene, and the balance of male and female elements in the band, an important point considering his role in the Patty Smith Group.",5,Big Sister And The Holding Company,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,3356,"['One', 'interminable', 'string', 'documentaries', 'San', 'Francisco', 'hippy', 'scene', 'one', 'documents', 'formation', 'eccentric', 'psychedelic', 'rock', 'band', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Holding', 'Company', 'work', 'did', 'putting', 'together', 'sloppy', 'soulful', 'rock', 'unit', 'eventually', 'hooked', 'up', 'young', 'singer', 'Texas', 'called', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'gifted', 'singer', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'called', 'ugliest', 'man', 'campus', 'university', 'put', 'out', 'two', 'albums', 'started', 'getting', 'attention', 'Then', 'played', 'Monterey', 'Pop', 'Festival', '1967', 'where', 'hung', 'out', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'pop', 'musicians', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'as', 'well', 'Jim', 'Hendrix', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'Showing', 'San', 'Francisco', 'music', 'country', 'first', 'time', 'band', 'made', 'bad', 'career', 'move', 'refusing', 'sign', 'away', 'film', 'permission', 'free', 'lost', 'place', 'history', 'Janis', 'however', 'did', 'sign', 'film', 'only', 'making', 'look', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Holding', 'Company', 'were', 'really', 'only', 'backup', 'band', 'Well', 'probably', 'was', 'most', 'talented', 'member', 'band', 'evidenced', 'fact', 'none', 'other', 'members', 'went', 'make', 'much', 'mark', 'band', 'broke', 'up', 'later', 'year', 'mark', 'point', 'surviving', 'members', 'band', 'talk', 'recording', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', 'band', 'second', 'album', 'big', 'studio', 'proper', 'recording', 'budget', 'how', 'band', 'would', 'sweat', 'hours', 'lay', 'down', 'basic', 'track', 'only', 'watch', 'Janis', 'stroll', 'do', 'vocals', 'one', 'two', 'takes.The', 'documentary', 'quite', 'good', 'covering', 'lot', 'history', 'emotions', 'extras', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'too', 'are', 'four', 'full', 'performances', 'three', 'parts', 'band', 'career', 'photo', 'gallery', 'interview', 'outtakes', 'four', 'surviving', 'members', 'band', 'New', 'York', 'rock', 'critic', 'Ellen', 'Willis', 'rock', 'historian', 'guitarist', 'Patty', 'Smith', 'Group', 'Lenny', 'Kaye', 'as', 'well', 'Nick', 'Gravenites', 'who', 'wrote', 'songs', 'Janis', 'also', 'appeared', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Holding', 'Company', 'Seeing', 'interviews', 'four', 'surviving', 'members', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Holding', 'company', 'interesting', 'get', 'appreciate', 'intelligence', 'drummer', 'David', 'Getz', 'who', 'came', 'off', 'bit', 'dummy', 'historical', 'footage', 'aloofness', 'star', 'guitarist', 'James', 'Gurley', 'star', 'had', 'been', 'outshone', 'Joplin', 'when', 'joined', 'band', 'Gurley', 'died', 'last', 'week', 'December', '20th', 'having', 'survived', 'heroin', 'overdose', 'death', 'wife', '1970', 'years', 'hard', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'living', 'members', 'are', 'asked', 'where', 'were', 'when', 'heard', 'Janis', 'had', 'died', 'heard', 'same', 'roadie', 'reacted', 'different', 'ways', 'Gurley', 'being', 'quite', 'cool', 'one', 'was', 'surprised', 'only', 'Sam', 'Andrew', 'rhythm', 'guitarist', 'who', 'left', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Holding', 'Company', 'Janis', 'be', 'part', 'new', 'Kozmic', 'Blues', 'Band', 'showed', 'real', 'emotion.Lenny', 'Kaye', 'highly', 'engaging', 'interviews', 'are', 'best', 'collection', 'band', 'great', 'reverence', 'seemed', 'San', 'Francisco', 'band', 'was', 'most', 'interested', 'seeing', 'when', 'travelled', 'country', 'join', 'scene', '1967', 'had', 'interesting', 'tales', 'tell', 'cross-country', 'trip', 'scene', 'balance', 'male', 'female', 'elements', 'band', 'important', 'point', 'considering', 'role', 'Patty', 'Smith', 'Group']",N/A
