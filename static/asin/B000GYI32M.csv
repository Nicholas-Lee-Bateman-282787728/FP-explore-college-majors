1008063,AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B000GYI32M,Brittany Rose,"[0, 2]","I have a theory about the OC - or at least the first 3 seasons.  The more grim and depressing it is, the darker the box gets.  The first season was packaged in sunny orange to reflect the humour and fun of the show, while season 2 was slightly more melancholy in blue...well Season 3 comes in a grey box.  What do you make of that?I was hesitant to even buy S3 of The OC on DVD because in my memory it wasn't as good as the first two seasons, and I was proven right upon rewatching it.  My friends & I have discussed what goes wrong in this season (and the following, let's not even go there) and it's many-fold.  For one, the fact that everything eventually turns out okay is quite predictable.  Sure characters die, but they're brushed under the rug.  A second problem is the focus on secondary or minor characters as the original family focus is diminished.  All of a sudden you have episodes devoted to Marissa's little sister or Summer's dad or the school villain Taylor or Sandy's co-worker, and it becomes a lot less about the family unit created in Season 1 and torn apart in Season 2 with Sandy & Kirsten's problems.Which leads to a third major problem, all of a sudden, Kirsten is a non-entity on the show.  She does nothing but give disapproving glares and momly advice, there are no fiery outbursts or comical musings as we saw in earlier seasons.  Did I mention the show also becomes a lot less funny?  Everything is all gloom and doom and misunderstandings abound.  But really the number one thing that I think kills this season is the fact everyone is so seperate and dealing with so many seperate (but predictable these days) storylines and small characters that you stop caring.To recap the season briefly - if the above paragraphs haven't convinced you of its downfall - it picks up several months after the shooting incident with Marissa.  Of course, things turn out well there except Marissa & Ryan are exiled from Harbour thanks to a new Dean of Discipline and his student sidekick Taylor.  Ryan gets back in eventually after a brief stint of homeschooling (aka visiting Marissa all the time) while Marissa attends public school and befriends some surfers, Johnny and Chilly.  Eventually Johnny quite predictably falls in love with Marissa, who remains loyal to Ryan, but some disasterous results eventually tear the 3 of them apart.  Meanwhile Seth and Summer are figuring out their college plans, or lack thereof, Julie is searching for her next sugar daddy, Sandy is a corporate bigwig running the Newport Group, and Kirsten is...doing nothing.One additional frustrating thing about this season is that a big focus is of course on senior year and college (although in theory if you watch season 1 the show started in grade 11 so season 2 was grade 11 and a 1/2 I guess).  Yet if you bother going on to S4, college is a nonentity!In terms of special features, I haven't gotten through them all yet but there is a few ""pass the remote"" features, in other words, commentaries with Josh Schwartz the show's creator and various others.  The gag reel isn't quite as funny as past years, and the Subways 'making of' is kind of dumb other than to see a few of the sets in a different way.Overall, a purchase only for the die-hard OC fan (I got mine on sale for $20).  It'll break your heart to watch the show that rocked us so much in season 1, and more or less in season 2...and don't even get me started on season 4.",2,The Dark Side Indeed,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,3434,"['have', 'theory', 'OC', 'least', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'more', 'grim', 'depressing', 'darker', 'box', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'packaged', 'sunny', 'orange', 'reflect', 'humour', 'fun', 'show', 'season', '2', 'was', 'slightly', 'more', 'melancholy', 'blue', 'well', 'Season', '3', 'grey', 'box', 'What', 'do', 'make', 'was', 'hesitant', 'even', 'buy', 'S3', 'OC', 'DVD', 'memory', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'proven', 'right', 'rewatching', 'My', 'have', 'discussed', 'what', 'wrong', 'season', 'following', 'let', 'not', 'even', 'go', 'there', 'many-fold', 'one', 'fact', 'everything', 'eventually', 'out', 'okay', 'quite', 'predictable', 'Sure', 'characters', 'die', ""'re"", 'brushed', 'rug', 'second', 'problem', 'focus', 'secondary', 'minor', 'characters', 'original', 'family', 'focus', 'diminished', 'sudden', 'have', 'episodes', 'devoted', 'Marissa', 'little', 'sister', 'Summer', 'dad', 'school', 'villain', 'Taylor', 'Sandy', 'co-worker', 'lot', 'less', 'family', 'unit', 'created', 'Season', '1', 'torn', 'apart', 'Season', '2', 'Sandy', 'Kirsten', 'problems.Which', 'third', 'major', 'problem', 'sudden', 'Kirsten', 'non-entity', 'show', 'nothing', 'give', 'disapproving', 'glares', 'momly', 'advice', 'are', 'fiery', 'outbursts', 'comical', 'musings', 'saw', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Did', 'mention', 'show', 'also', 'lot', 'less', 'funny', 'Everything', 'gloom', 'doom', 'misunderstandings', 'abound', 'really', 'number', 'one', 'thing', 'think', 'kills', 'season', 'fact', 'everyone', 'so', 'seperate', 'dealing', 'so', 'many', 'seperate', 'predictable', 'days', 'storylines', 'small', 'characters', 'stop', 'caring.To', 'recap', 'season', 'briefly', 'above', 'paragraphs', 'have', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'downfall', 'up', 'several', 'months', 'shooting', 'incident', 'Marissa', 'course', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'there', 'Marissa', 'Ryan', 'are', 'exiled', 'Harbour', 'thanks', 'new', 'Dean', 'Discipline', 'student', 'sidekick', 'Taylor', 'Ryan', 'back', 'eventually', 'brief', 'stint', 'homeschooling', 'visiting', 'Marissa', 'time', 'Marissa', 'public', 'school', 'surfers', 'Johnny', 'Chilly', 'Eventually', 'Johnny', 'quite', 'predictably', 'love', 'Marissa', 'who', 'loyal', 'Ryan', 'disasterous', 'results', 'eventually', 'tear', '3', 'apart', 'Meanwhile', 'Seth', 'Summer', 'are', 'figuring', 'out', 'college', 'plans', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Julie', 'searching', 'next', 'sugar', 'daddy', 'Sandy', 'corporate', 'bigwig', 'running', 'Newport', 'Group', 'Kirsten', 'doing', 'nothing.One', 'additional', 'frustrating', 'thing', 'season', 'big', 'focus', 'course', 'senior', 'year', 'college', 'theory', 'watch', 'season', '1', 'show', 'started', 'grade', '11', 'so', 'season', '2', 'was', 'grade', '11', '1/2', 'guess', 'bother', 'going', 'S4', 'college', 'nonentity', 'terms', 'special', 'features', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'yet', 'few', 'remote', 'features', 'other', 'words', 'commentaries', 'Josh', 'Schwartz', 'show', 'creator', 'various', 'others', 'gag', 'reel', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'past', 'years', 'Subways', ""'making"", 'kind', 'dumb', 'other', 'see', 'few', 'sets', 'different', 'way.Overall', 'purchase', 'only', 'die-hard', 'OC', 'fan', 'got', 'mine', 'sale', '20', ""'ll"", 'break', 'heart', 'watch', 'show', 'rocked', 'so', 'much', 'season', '1', 'more', 'less', 'season', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'season', '4']",The O.C.: Season 3

1008071,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B000GYI32M,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[19, 23]","Okay, so season three of my favorite primetime soap opera, The O.C., wasn't nearly up to snuff with the spectacular first season and the slightly less spectacular second season. But, despite that, I still tuned in every Thursday night and when the DVDs were released, I bought them and relived the season again.While the third season was a bit of a letdown in a number of ways, I will say that a month into the fourth season, The O.C. has regained its form and is shining. It's just too bad that it is up against the two strongest shows on television, CSI and Grey's Anatomy. Despite all that, season four is looking to be the best season since the phenomenal first season.My opinion on why the third season was a bit of a letdown is the fact that creator Josh Schwartz seems to have taken a back seat in this season. He was the one with the vision for the show and its fantastic inaugural season and without him in his prominent position (or so it seems), the show wasn't quite the same.Unfortunately, the show continued to introduce unlikeable characters in the third season, much as they had in the first two seasons. This takes away from the great relationships that make the show so good, the Sandy and Kirsten, Summer and Seth, Ryan and Marissa and Julie and her man of the week, storylines.Season three picked up a short while after the shocking season two finale left off. As we left them, Marissa (Mischa Barton) had just shot Ryan's (Ben McKenzie) brother Trey (guest star Logan Marshall Green) as the two brothers fought. Fearing for Ryan's life, Marissa pulled the trigger just moments before Seth (Adam Brody) and Summer (the absolutely gorgeous Rachel Bilson) walked through the door.Trey had been nothing but trouble since his arrival in Newport Beach in season two. He had betrayed Ryan and the Cohen family, attacked Marissa and gotten into a boatload of trouble. The gunshot didn't kill him, but left him in a coma. Marissa's role in the shooting was questioned, as Julie Cooper (Melinda Clarke), still reeling from the death of her second husband Caleb Nicol at the end of season two, tried to pay off Trey to implicate Ryan and spare Marissa. The ploy didn't work and Trey rode off into the sunset on a Greyhound bus.But, the implications from the shooting lived on, as both Marissa and Ryan were expelled from the Harbor School. While Ryan was readmitted, Marissa spent most of the season at Newport Union, the local public school, where she met even more people that would play a significant role in the rest of the season.The start of the season also found Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) in rehab, where she had been admitted at the end of season two, as Sandy (Peter Gallagher), Ryan and Seth tried to cope with her out of the house. Kirsten met Charlotte (guest star Jeri Ryan) in rehab and she would also play a big role in the early part of the season.The Marissa-Ryan story line again took some strange turns, as has been the case in the first two years. Her banishment to Newport Union found her hanging with new friends, particularly surfer Johnny (guest star Ryan Donowho), which brought out a little jealousy in Ryan. The two were on and off for much of the season, with Marissa hooking up with bad-boy Volchok (guest star Cam Gigandet), a former friend of Johnny's, after Johnny fell off a cliff to his death in front of Marissa, Ryan and Marissa's younger sister Caitlin (guest star and future series regular Willa Holland). His death also led to the introduction of his cousin Sadie (guest star Nikki Reed). Sadie and Ryan had a brief relationship, but his acceptance at college kind of turned things around as she headed off into the sunset. Marissa eventually returns to Harbor, thanks to a little help from an unlikely ally, Taylor Townsend (guest star and future series regular Autumn Reeser, who is Summer's top competition for most beautiful woman on television).While Marissa was at Newport Union, her mother Julie was searching for a way to get back on her feet. Caleb's will left her with no money and because of that, her attempt to reunite with her former husband and Marissa's dad, Jimmy Cooper (guest star Tate Donovan) failed and Julie was forced to move into a trailer park, while Marissa bunked at Summer's house. Of course Julie wasn't down for long, as she quickly became cozy with Summer's dad Neil (guest star Michael Nouri) and the two became engaged near the end of the season. Julie and Kirsten also started a high end match making business that remains part of the show in season four.With Kirsten in rehab, the management of the Newport Group is left to Sandy and he finds himself caught between his morals and big business as he strives to build a new hospital. Kirsten's return home isn't all roses either, as she brings Charlotte to town and with that comes a whole load of trouble, as she tries to bilk first Kirsten and then Julie, out of money. She ultimately fails and disappears without a trace, thankfully. The hospital deal eats into Sandy's time and causes a lot of stress on his marriage. His decision to back out of the deal at the end of the season shows that he is back to the old Sandy.The core relationship in season three was the Summer-Seth storyline. With college on the horizon, Summer worries that Seth's desire to get as far away from Newport as possible will pull them apart. But, when Summer aces her SATs, much to Seth's surprise, the two apply to Brown together. Seth doesn't get in and not wanting to stop Summer from going, he breaks up with her. Of course, this devastates both of them, and comes to head at prom, where Summer tries to drink away her problems. Seth, determined to win back the love of his life, heads to Brown for student orientation, bound to find a way in. While there, he runs into Anna (guest star Samaire Armstrong), a blast from the first season past. While they can't concoct a plan to get Seth into Brown, Anna finds an alternative in the Rhode Island School of Design, and then proceeds to help Summer and Seth get back together again.As mentioned, this season continued the introduction of characters that just aren't likeable. Volchok and Charlotte come to mind as the two worst offenders. Johnny played the role of Oliver in season one, the person who came between Ryan and Marissa. Thankfully, all the characters were written out of the show at the end of the season or at the beginning of season four.The shocking finale (though it wasn't as shocking as it could've been had Mischa Barton not gone on television and told the world that she was being killed off), brought viewers back to the first season, as Ryan carried Marissa away from the burning car, much like he carried her out of an ally in Tijuana two years earlier. The effects of her death are felt strongly in season four, as the main characters try to carry on without her.This set had some interesting bonus features. The making of the Subways music video was a short piece on the band's appearance on the show. What's in a Name was an interesting feature showing how Josh Schwartz uses people he knows and staffers on the show to name characters on the show. There is a solid gag reel, a making of an episode featurette and an interesting take on commentary. Viewers listen to Schwartz and other staff members talk about certain scenes in two different episodes. It's not one whole episode of commentary, but it is still interesting to hear some behind the scenes stuff.While the show itself hit a bump in the road during season three, the DVD set was well done and the packaging was significantly better than that for season two.

1008072,A2ALDF5E2WY5TC,B000GYI32M,"Kathleen Donaldson ""jverder537""","[3, 16]","There are four people to thank for saving The OC from cancellation and those four are Peter Gallagher, Adam Brody, Rachel Bilson and Kelly Rowan. These four tremendous actors make a lifeless season of an entertaining, sometimes brilliant show seem great.Some people not to thank: the writers, Mischa Barton for her terrible acting, Ben McKenzie for brooding and making awkward smiles and Tate Donavan for making his character more of a looser than he's written.Why is this season so lifeless? Well, for one thing, a plethora of new characters that pale in comparsion to Anna and even Oliver are added. Characters like Johnny, Chillie and the non-charcter Volcheck, who really is just a mime that punches and broods.The dialogue also looses its wit. Yes, Brody, Gallagher and the rest of the Cohen clan are still very funny, but their dialogue has none of the snap, crackle and pop of Season 1 and even Season 2.The new music also is rather annoying. It sounds like one note is being played throughout an entire scene.And finally, the stories. The show starts off with some interesting plot lines for the adults and even gives Kirsten Cohen a touching moment at AA (later in the season). But the kids are constantly have new idiots being thrown at them. The only character who is the saving grace of the show is the kinda new character of Marissa's sister, Katlin. The character, a teenage sexpot, seems like an interesting addtion. The stories, which are just rehashes of previous ones (without decent dialouge) are boring. The only saving grace of a story lines were the ones that involved Sandy's hospital dream and Brody's drug use.And I'm forgetting one more thing, the character of Taylor who really bugs me. I don't know why. She just seems wrong for th show. The actress who plays her does fine with the part, I just don't like the character.With the death of the awful character of Marissa played by the bland Mischa Barton (whom must take acting lessons), hopefully the fourth season will bring new beginnings to the show. I'm curious and excited to see what Marrissa's sister will bring to the show and what antics Brody will pull. I'm also interested in seeing how Sandy and Kirsten develop. Mr. Gallagher and Ms. Rowan have been overlooked for three years at the Emmys for these strong performances.I'm also curious if Ryan will kill himself after the death of his love Marissa. That might help the show too.",3,"Gallager, Brody, Bilson and Rowan save a rather dire season",1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,2420,"['are', 'four', 'people', 'thank', 'saving', 'OC', 'cancellation', 'four', 'are', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'Kelly', 'Rowan', 'four', 'tremendous', 'actors', 'make', 'lifeless', 'season', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'brilliant', 'show', 'seem', 'great.Some', 'people', 'not', 'thank', 'writers', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'terrible', 'acting', 'Ben', 'McKenzie', 'brooding', 'making', 'awkward', 'smiles', 'Tate', 'Donavan', 'making', 'character', 'more', 'looser', 'written.Why', 'season', 'so', 'lifeless', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'plethora', 'new', 'characters', 'pale', 'comparsion', 'Anna', 'even', 'Oliver', 'are', 'added', 'Characters', 'Johnny', 'Chillie', 'non-charcter', 'Volcheck', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'mime', 'punches', 'broods.The', 'dialogue', 'also', 'wit', 'Yes', 'Brody', 'Gallagher', 'rest', 'Cohen', 'clan', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'none', 'snap', 'crackle', 'pop', 'Season', '1', 'even', 'Season', '2.The', 'new', 'music', 'also', 'rather', 'annoying', 'one', 'note', 'being', 'played', 'entire', 'scene.And', 'finally', 'stories', 'show', 'off', 'interesting', 'plot', 'lines', 'adults', 'even', 'Kirsten', 'Cohen', 'touching', 'moment', 'AA', 'later', 'season', 'kids', 'are', 'constantly', 'have', 'new', 'idiots', 'being', 'thrown', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'saving', 'grace', 'show', 'kinda', 'new', 'character', 'Marissa', 'sister', 'Katlin', 'character', 'teenage', 'sexpot', 'interesting', 'addtion', 'stories', 'are', 'just', 'rehashes', 'previous', 'ones', 'decent', 'dialouge', 'are', 'boring', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'ones', 'involved', 'Sandy', 'hospital', 'dream', 'Brody', 'drug', 'use.And', ""'m"", 'forgetting', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'character', 'Taylor', 'who', 'really', 'bugs', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'just', 'wrong', 'th', 'show', 'actress', 'who', 'fine', 'part', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'character.With', 'death', 'awful', 'character', 'Marissa', 'played', 'bland', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'whom', 'must', 'take', 'acting', 'lessons', 'hopefully', 'fourth', 'season', 'will', 'bring', 'new', 'beginnings', 'show', ""'m"", 'curious', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'Marrissa', 'sister', 'will', 'bring', 'show', 'what', 'antics', 'Brody', 'will', 'pull', ""'m"", 'also', 'interested', 'seeing', 'how', 'Sandy', 'Kirsten', 'develop', 'Mr.', 'Gallagher', 'Ms.', 'Rowan', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'three', 'years', 'Emmys', 'strong', 'performances.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'curious', 'Ryan', 'will', 'kill', 'death', 'love', 'Marissa', 'might', 'help', 'show', 'too']",The O.C.: Season 3

This year, the kids are seniors and college is on the horizon.  Ryan romances a dull newcomer, acts like he's 40 years old, and has way too little screen time.  Marissa, once the queen of Harbor School, goes to  public school with some unsavory new friends.  Summer and Seth spend most of their time bickering, as do Sandy and Kirsten.  Only spunky Julie Cooper stays true to her character as she merrily copes with new-found poverty and an unexpected new love.What made the show great in the beginning was seeing Ryan adjust to the Newpsies and the on-again, off-again romances of the ""Core Four"" and their parents.

That wasn't enough for me, I HAD to have my own legitimate copies and have not regretted my decision.The OC is dramatic, interesting and yet fun and humourous. The characters all compliment eachother and none leave the viewer rolling their eyes and fast-forwarding to the next episode in boredom.

The cast is really good and believable enough to either make you love them or hate them. The show is very emotional at times and it is very addicting. I think what scared me away before I ever saw an episode was that I figured The O.C. was just another show about rich kids in California like Beverly Hills 90210 and/or Melrose place.

It was hurt by new irratating and implausable characters. (Johnny, I thought, was boring. Jim Cooper, an old character, was pathetic. I would have preferred to see that he grew and learned from his mistakes.)Some of the story lines were also implausable and weak. I suspect this was partly because there was no great conflict in the series. Ryan had become assimilated into Newport and was no longer at odds with it. (I think a nice twist would have been to deepen the conflict between Marissa and her new public-school world.)In short, I no longer knew what the series was about, or what important goals its characters had.I found the the second half of the season much better, especially because the series seemed to take a deeper, more dramatic turn. (It was certainly an adult drama as much as a teen one.) Yes, there were some problems - I felt Seth's pot smoking happened too fast and wasn't developed - but I like the way Julie's character seemed to grow and the way Kristen battled her alcoholism.It seemed the good, likeable characters - to me the most endearing part of the series - had a more central role.Finally, though I know some will disagree, I think Vollcheck, a perfect, believable rival to Ryan, brought a much needed sense of good vs. evil. I now had someone to root against.And so I again became addicted to The O.C.",3,A Tale of Two Halves,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,1430,"['found', 'third', 'season', 'be', 'tale', 'two', 'halves', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'was', 'hurt', 'new', 'irratating', 'implausable', 'characters', 'Johnny', 'thought', 'was', 'boring', 'Jim', 'Cooper', 'old', 'character', 'was', 'pathetic', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'grew', 'learned', 'mistakes', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'also', 'implausable', 'weak', 'suspect', 'was', 'partly', 'was', 'great', 'conflict', 'series', 'Ryan', 'had', 'become', 'assimilated', 'Newport', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'odds', 'think', 'nice', 'twist', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'deepen', 'conflict', 'Marissa', 'new', 'public-school', 'world', 'short', 'no', 'longer', 'knew', 'what', 'series', 'was', 'what', 'important', 'goals', 'characters', 'had.I', 'found', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'much', 'better', 'especially', 'series', 'seemed', 'take', 'deeper', 'more', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'was', 'certainly', 'adult', 'drama', 'as', 'much', 'teen', 'one', 'Yes', 'were', 'problems', 'felt', 'Seth', 'pot', 'smoking', 'happened', 'too', 'fast', 'was', ""n't"", 'developed', 'like', 'way', 'Julie', 'character', 'seemed', 'grow', 'way', 'Kristen', 'battled', 'alcoholism.It', 'seemed', 'good', 'likeable', 'characters', 'most', 'endearing', 'part', 'series', 'had', 'more', 'central', 'role.Finally', 'know', 'will', 'disagree', 'think', 'Vollcheck', 'perfect', 'believable', 'rival', 'Ryan', 'brought', 'much', 'needed', 'sense', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'now', 'had', 'someone', 'root', 'against.And', 'so', 'again', 'became', 'addicted', 'O.C']",The O.C.: Season 3

1008081,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000GYI32M,Robert Moore,"[123, 135]","December 1, 2006 Addition:  I wanted to add a note responding to my own question in my original headline:  Can it rebound in Season Four?  The great news is:  Yes!  If there were an Emmy given for ""The Comeback Show of the Year,"" THE O.C. after its first five episodes would have to be a leading candidate.  I will be honest:  I initially tuned in just to verify that THE O.C. in its 4th season was as bad as it was in its 3rd.  I was going to watch two or three episodes and then give up on it.  The great news is that it has completely returned to form and is now as good as it has been since it first started.  This was not expected!  The main reason is has been so good has been that it has gotten back to enjoying the characters, instead of introducing a string of unlikable ones that no one can stand.  So far this season, not a single irritating new character!  I was afraid that they would make Caitlin into the new Marissa, but so far she hasn't been too bad.  The biggest surprise has to be Taylor.  I assumed that she would no longer be a part of the show this season, but they not only have brought her back, they've made her vastly more intersting and sympathetic than I would ever have imagined.  She is actually now a character I like.  Who'd a thunk it?  Right now the show is as strong as it was in Season One.  One of the best turnarounds I've ever seen a show make.The third season of THE OC was an almost unbelievable come down from the first two fun seasons.  The things that made people enjoy the show the first two seasons were largely pushed to the side, while the more irritating features of the first two seasons were brought to the fore and made the center of the show.  On several occasions both I and my good friend who also watches the show debated about whether we were going to stop watching it.  There is a point where the displeasure is watching the show threatened to overwhelm any pleasures it brought.  Then, after a season of one unpleasantness after another, the show ended on a shocker.  Normally one would require a Spoiler warning for this, but unfortunately Mischa Barton herself spoiled the ending by announcing on national TV a few days before the season finale that her character was going to die on the show.  Why she did this has been debated.  Was she trying to hurt the show?  Was she just being stupid?  Whatever the reason, what would have been one of the most shocking endings in recent TV history was common knowledge even before it aired.What went wrong in Season Three?  Well, the same things that went wrong in Seasons 1 and 2 but that played a smaller role each year:  the introduction of exceedingly unpleasant and irritating characters who dominate the course of the show's narrative.  In Season One this was mainly restricted to Oliver, one of the worst characters I've ever seen in a TV show.  My guess is that the show's creative team misinterpreted what made the show popular in Season One.  Instead of the fun alchemy between the younger members of the cast along with the narratives centering on the adult cast members--which I think was about 99% of the reason people liked the show--they imagined that the chaos injected into the show by Oliver's character was what people loved about it.  My own belief is that people liked the show DESPITE Oliver and the chaos he created, not because of him.  I'm sure the show's producers imagined that Oliver was a character that viewers loved to hate, instead of merely hating him, which was the actual case.  So, in Season Two, the show's producers and writers gave even more characters that we merely hated (instead of loved to hate), the unlikable Alex (who was unlikable not because she became Marissa's lover but because she was merely unlikable) and Trey, Ryan's older brother.Because the producer's misunderstood what people were liking about the show--people liked the main characters, not the situations generated by the minor, intensely unlikable characters who upset the show's chemistry--they flooded the third season with terrible characters.  It started early on in the rehab facility, where we were introduced to the duplicitous Charlotte, a role on which they wasted the wonderful Jeri Ryan.  Luckily, Charlotte didn't stay on the show very long, though she was extremely unpleasant while she did.  Also early in the season was the terrible Dean Jack Hess, another thoroughly unlikable and wildly implausible character who seemed to have a personal vendetta against Ryan and Marissa.  He too disappeared fairly early on.  But by then we had been introduced to Johnny, a semi-professional surfer at the public school Marissa was forced to attend after she was kicked out of her private school (her dismissal being merely one more of a host of unbelievable developments).  Now, in Johnny's defense, he was not for the most part a terrible character.  But his crush on Marissa and Marissa's ongoing inability to do the commonsense things to protect her relationship with Ryan was part and parcel of the stupidity on the part of all the major characters that almost caused the show to unravel.  But even with all these irritating characters, the show's producers weren't done.  Taylor Townshend was not really a character but a cartoon of a character, someone determined to take over as the school's social leader with the departure of Marissa and as Seth's girlfriend.  Now, I will concede that she did become less unlikable as the season went on, and I liked that the show tried to turn her from a bad to a good character.  But throughout she remained intensely annoying.  There were numerous other unpleasant characters, but the crown for the title of King of the annoying characters of the third season clearly belongs to Vollchek, Johnny's surfing competitor, petty thug, briefly Marissa's lover, and all around annoying guy.  He is also the guy who causes Marissa's death.  While he doesn't come up to the annoying level of Oliver, he is close.As a result of this endless parade of unlikable characters and stupid behavior on the part of the main characters (except Summer, who seems to be the only character immune to occasional idiocy--her aside, there were numerous occasions when you wanted to smack all of the major characters aside the head and yell, ""Will you get a grip!""), fan discontent grew and grew and ratings of the show fell precipitously.  After the end of the season there were rumors that FOX was so displeased with the show that they considered canceling it.  In the end, they agreed to bring it back for 16 episodes, starting it much later in the season's schedule and running it without repeats, with the possibility of adding additional episodes if the ratings recover and if it turns out that people watch the show with Marissa off the show.  It may well turn out, however, that the terrible Season Three was the beginning of the end for THE OC.My central complaint with the show--even more than the parade of awful guest characters--is that the show more and more abandoned what made the show fun in the first two seasons:  the interplay between the central characters.  I hated Oliver and Trey and Alex and Vollchek and Johnny et al. but loved Sandy standing up for his principles, the wonderful interplay between Summer and Seth, Ryan and Marissa's mutual attraction despite their backgrounds.  Everything else I put up with so I could enjoy that part of the show.  But more and more this all retreated to the background.  To be honest, pretty much the only reason I continued watching the show throughout Season Three was to enjoy the improbable relationship between Summer and Seth.  As unhappy as I was with Season 3, I will probably at least start off watching the show in Season 4 just to see how they are doing.  But my interest in the show is at this point on life support.No question that the single biggest development in the entire run of the show was the death of Marissa.  As much as some fans want her to come back, she is definitely dead and definitely won't be back.  Mischa Barton's departure from the show seems to be a mutual decision.  As the show's highest profile character (she has appeared on numerous magazine covers the past three years), she has undoubtedly been contemplating leaving TV for the movies for some time, a move accelerated by her well-publicized financial obligations owing to a break up.  Even if she and the producers wanted her back, she is already tied to several movies projects and unable to do so.  There are many fans who watched the show just to see if Ryan and Marissa would get back together.  For them her departure could be fatal to their interest in the show.  But the fact is that almost all of the horrible characters I noted earlier were connected to the show via Marissa.  Almost all of the worst things in the show were narratively tied to Marissa.  So, there is a real chance that the show could develop in different and better directions.  But I am fearful that the writers and producers will continue in the direction the show has gone, bringing in one awful character after another, having the main characters engage in self-defeating or self-destructive behavior.  When I first started watching the show, it was largely because of elements it shared with a show like THE GILMORE GIRL (on which Adam Brody was a character).  I was hoping for a comedy with dramatic subplots, but instead the show has descended more and more into melodrama with less and less comedy.  But I'm hoping that in Season 4 they can shift the focus more onto Summer and Seth and thereby emphasize the comedic elements that made the show so much fun in the first two seasons.  But, I'm prepared to be disappointed.",3,An astonishingly disappointing season - can it rebound in Season 4?,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,9702,"['December', '1', '2006', 'Addition', 'wanted', 'add',

1008085,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B000GYI32M,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[13, 24]","I have been watching ""The OC"" since the very first episode.  In the beginning I literally feel in love with the characters, the amazing plot lines, and the spectacular writing.  It wasn't the fact that ""the OC"" was a posh television series, while I loved it - it was because it was one of the very few series that I could find characters that I identitfy.  Unlike 'Dawson's Creek' or 'Beverly Hills 90210,' 'The OC' had characters that could have been my friends, they where so alike to the typical teenagers of present time... I'm not saying everyone is rich and beautiful, but the are insecure, klingy, and come with baggage.The third season of the series though had a definate drop in quality.  The creator took a backseat for the year, and the quality definately reflects his decision.  While all the characters have major choices and decisions in their lives - this is senior year afterall - its all left with an odd feeling behind.Senior Year is suppose to be full of life-altnerning decisions and events and the series seems to kinda gloss over all these facts...  The episodes in the season include:The AftermathThe Shape of Things to ComeThe End of InnocenceThe Last WaltzThe Perfect StormThe SwellsThe Anger ManagementThe Game PlanThe DisconnectThe Chrismukkah Bar Mitz-vahkkahThe Safe HarborThe Sister ActThe Pot StirrerThe CliffhangerThe Heavy LiftingThe Road WarriorThe JourneyThe UndertowThe Secrets and LiesThe Day After TomorrowThe Dawn PatrolThe College TryThe Party FavorThe Man of the YearThe Graduates",3,Loosing the Spark,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,1521,"['have', 'been', 'watching', 'OC', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'beginning', 'literally', 'feel', 'love', 'characters', 'amazing', 'plot', 'lines', 'spectacular', 'writing', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'OC', 'was', 'posh', 'television', 'series', 'loved', 'was', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'series', 'could', 'find', 'characters', 'identitfy', ""'Dawson"", 'Creek', ""'Beverly"", 'Hills', '90210', 'OC', 'had', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'where', 'so', 'alike', 'typical', 'teenagers', 'present', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'everyone', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'are', 'insecure', 'klingy', 'come', 'baggage.The', 'third', 'season', 'series', 'had', 'definate', 'drop', 'quality', 'creator', 'took', 'backseat', 'year', 'quality', 'definately', 'decision', 'characters', 'have', 'major', 'choices', 'decisions', 'lives', 'senior', 'year', 'afterall', 'left', 'odd', 'feeling', 'behind.Senior', 'Year', 'suppose', 'be', 'full', 'life-altnerning', 'decisions', 'events', 'series', 'kinda', 'gloss', 'facts', 'episodes', 'season', 'include', 'AftermathThe', 'Shape', 'Things', 'ComeThe', 'End', 'InnocenceThe', 'Last', 'WaltzThe', 'Perfect', 'StormThe', 'SwellsThe', 'Anger', 'ManagementThe', 'Game', 'PlanThe', 'DisconnectThe', 'Chrismukkah', 'Bar', 'Mitz-vahkkahThe', 'Safe', 'HarborThe', 'Sister', 'ActThe', 'Pot', 'StirrerThe', 'CliffhangerThe', 'Heavy', 'LiftingThe', 'Road', 'WarriorThe', 'JourneyThe', 'UndertowThe', 'Secrets', 'LiesThe', 'Day', 'TomorrowThe', 'Dawn', 'PatrolThe', 'College', 'TryThe', 'Party', 'FavorThe', 'Man', 'YearThe', 'Graduates']",The O.C.: Season 3
