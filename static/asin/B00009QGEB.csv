Its a movie made for God's because aparently everything they say is important and has to be followed by long pauses.This was the most pretentious drivel I've seen in a long time. Its one of those wannabe artists who try to make an 'important' film, by making everything serious. Get off it.Do people really walk around moping all the time? The movie doesn't even make any sense. And the ending? Jeez..It was like a really really bad asian version of Lost in Translation. Really bad.I seriously cannot comprehend how anyone with any artistic sense (mature artistic sense) could say this movie is any good. How? It is inconceivable that its won any type of awards. Though I suppose other wannabe artists gave it to them since it was such an important deep film about flaky people and their moping depressing relationships that go nowhere and make no sense.At least slap in some nudity to make the movie worth something!!",1,The Most important movie every made!!,1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,1014,"['why', ""'d"", 'give', 'zero', 'could', 'just', 'too', 'important', 'deep', 'mere', 'mortals', 'movie', 'made', 'God', 'aparently', 'everything', 'say', 'important', 'be', 'followed', 'long', 'pauses.This', 'was', 'most', 'pretentious', 'drivel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'wannabe', 'artists', 'who', 'try', 'make', ""'important"", 'film', 'making', 'everything', 'serious', 'Get', 'off', 'it.Do', 'people', 'really', 'walk', 'moping', 'time', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'ending', 'Jeez..It', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'asian', 'version', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Really', 'bad.I', 'seriously', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'how', 'anyone', 'artistic', 'sense', 'mature', 'artistic', 'sense', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'good', 'How', 'inconceivable', 'won', 'type', 'awards', 'suppose', 'other', 'wannabe', 'artists', 'gave', 'was', 'such', 'important', 'deep', 'film', 'flaky', 'people', 'moping', 'depressing', 'relationships', 'go', 'nowhere', 'make', 'sense.At', 'least', 'slap', 'nudity', 'make', 'movie', 'something']",N/A

Eric Byler is to be commended for having the courage to keep this story simple - a tale of four personality 'disorders' and how they find the means to exist in this odd world.  Michael Idemoto is perhaps the loneliest outwardly, but all four characters seem to crave connection and simply cannot attach.  Eugenia Yuan is the idiosyncratic girl-child, Jacquelyn Kim is the woman of mystery who with Matt Westmore plays more of a catalytic agent than a character.  All four actors are beautiful, sensitive, and convincing.  The lighting and settings are well chosen.  In all, this little indie film is a quiet diversion, dealing more with what is not said than with just a script.",4,A Fine Example of Cinematic Minimalism: An Art Form,1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,1006,"['CHARLOTTE', 'SOMETIMES', 'nocturne', 'film', 'story', 'gently', 'lives', 'four', 'people', 'very', 'few', 'words', 'quite', 'bit', 'human', 'relationships', 'cocoons', 'spin', 'ourselves', 'safety', 'protection', 'fear', 'hoping', 'chrysalis', 'will', 'metamorphose', 'butterfly', 'moth', 'Eric', 'Byler', 'be', 'commended', 'having', 'courage', 'keep', 'story', 'simple', 'tale', 'four', 'personality', ""'disorders"", 'how', 'find', 'means', 'exist', 'odd', 'world', 'Michael', 'Idemoto', 'perhaps', 'loneliest', 'outwardly', 'four', 'characters', 'seem', 'crave', 'connection', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'attach', 'Eugenia', 'Yuan', 'idiosyncratic', 'girl-child', 'Jacquelyn', 'Kim', 'woman', 'mystery', 'who', 'Matt', 'Westmore', 'more', 'catalytic', 'agent', 'character', 'four', 'actors', 'are', 'beautiful', 'sensitive', 'convincing', 'lighting', 'settings', 'are', 'well', 'chosen', 'little', 'indie', 'film', 'quiet', 'diversion', 'dealing', 'more', 'what', 'not', 'said', 'just', 'script']",N/A

Yes, there are cultural aspects in the storyline, but they do not push their way to the forefront but remain as part of the color in the whole story.The actors and story are subtly put together which adds a lot of life to what could have been very straightforward and boring.  Instead, what is unsaid gives a depth to the characters that draws the viewer into the story more and more because we're trying to figure out their motivations through their actions rather than having everything spelt out for us.This one of my favorite films in my DVD collection.  It's very rewatchable because there's so much to observe in the scenes and really stays away from the cliche romantic motifs in favor of something that has a lot more tension in it.",5,enjoyable and rewatchable,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,842,"['asian', 'american', 'film', 'asian', 'americans', 'better', 'off', 'Yes', 'are', 'cultural', 'aspects', 'storyline', 'do', 'not', 'push', 'way', 'forefront', 'remain', 'part', 'color', 'whole', 'story.The', 'actors', 'story', 'are', 'subtly', 'put', 'together', 'lot', 'life', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'straightforward', 'boring', 'Instead', 'what', 'unsaid', 'depth', 'characters', 'draws', 'viewer', 'story', 'more', 'more', ""'re"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'motivations', 'actions', 'rather', 'having', 'everything', 'spelt', 'out', 'us.This', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'DVD', 'collection', 'very', 'rewatchable', 'so', 'much', 'observe', 'scenes', 'really', 'stays', 'away', 'cliche', 'romantic', 'motifs', 'favor', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'tension']",N/A

What a beautiful movie.  It meanders like any of our lives do from time to time...and it completely captured my attention and affection.  This movie is about 4 Asian characters...but, as other reviewers have mentioned, is not ethnically biased (except for the teasing over not being comfortable eating with chopsticks).  This movie does not hit any wrong notes.  It is sad and hopeful and you end it wanting good things for (most) of its characters.

Michael works as a mechanic and owns a duplex.  His tenants are a couple, Lori and Justin whose loud sex can be heard regularly through the walls.  Their ecstatic bliss really accents Michael's solitude.  Michael evokes sympathy because we see him alone at work, at home and at a bar.While out drinking one night, Michael meets Darcy.  Darcy is almost as quiet of a person as is Michael.  Michael's silence is sincere but Darcy's hides an awkward secret.  Her mysterious appearance in Micheal's life might be something great or a dark complication that brings him down.We watch these characters navigate moments of tension and repose.  The dialogue is at times sparse.  But the film offers some refreshing simplicity and moderate surprises.  I would recommend this even though I wouldn't call it one of my favorites.  I am impressed with the end result given what must have been a pretty small budget.",3,Grease Monkey Finds Love,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,985,"['Charlotte', 'Sometimes', 'film', 'four', 'people', 'lives', 'intersect', 'while', 'Michael', 'mechanic', 'duplex', 'tenants', 'are', 'couple', 'Lori', 'Justin', 'loud', 'sex', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'regularly', 'walls', 'ecstatic', 'bliss', 'really', 'Michael', 'solitude', 'Michael', 'sympathy', 'see', 'alone', 'work', 'home', 'bar.While', 'out', 'drinking', 'one', 'night', 'Michael', 'Darcy', 'Darcy', 'almost', 'quiet', 'person', 'Michael', 'Michael', 'silence', 'sincere', 'Darcy', 'hides', 'awkward', 'secret', 'mysterious', 'appearance', 'Micheal', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'great', 'dark', 'complication', 'down.We', 'watch', 'characters', 'navigate', 'moments', 'tension', 'repose', 'dialogue', 'times', 'sparse', 'film', 'refreshing', 'simplicity', 'moderate', 'surprises', 'would', 'recommend', 'even', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'one', 'favorites', 'am', 'impressed', 'end', 'result', 'given', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'small', 'budget']",N/A
757170,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00009QGEB,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Charlotte Sometimes (Eric Byler, 2002)I finally made it to the end of this movie on my third attempt. To be fair, the second time I got stopped halfway through wasn't my fault-- a defective disc was the culprit. But now, a year and a half after I first tried, I have finally seen the whole thing. And it does get better, though not enough so to warrant watching it again.The movie centers on Michael (Michael Idemoto), an auto mechanic who's in love with his downstairs neighbor, Lori (Eugenia Yuan of the upcoming Slaughter). Lori, however, is in a relationship with Justin (Matt Westmore of TV series Sunset Beach). Lori's relationship with Justin leaves a lot to be desired in the emotional arena, so she (unconsciously? we don't know) leads Michael on, squeezing him for the emotional aspects that her relationship lacks. All is well and good (for everyone but Michael, anyway) until Michael meets Darcy (Brokedown Palace's Jacqueline Kim) in the neighborhood bar one night. Darcy is mysterious, and Michael is immediately attracted to her, leading him into a choice that, realistically, he might never have to make (and that, even if he does, might not actually mean anything): keep pursuing the girl he can never have, or pursue the one who's interested in him? Darcy, of course, has a Big Secret(TM), which adds another subtext here.Or it should, anyway, but the Big Reveal of the Big Secret (TM) is quite a letdown, and really makes me wonder whether Byler (who both wrote and directed) was in any way interested in realism here. He seems to have been, since this movie is shot in that sort of neo-realistic fashion that's become popular in the Dogme-influenced indie scene. But once you untangle all of the twists and turns in the drama, you have to ask yourself how dumb these characters have gotta be. Michael, maybe, we can buy; he comes off as innocent and somewhat sheltered. But if you're going to set up Lori and Darcy as good guy and bad guy, one of them should probably be at least slightly less bad then the other. (Justin, maybe, we can buy as well; he's just thinking with the wrong body parts).There are some very interesting concepts here, but I think the material may have wanted a stronger adaptation. **",2,Could have been a great deal better.,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,2229,"['Charlotte', 'Sometimes', 'Eric', 'Byler', '2002', 'finally', 'made', 'end', 'movie', 'third', 'attempt', 'be', 'fair', 'second', 'time', 'got', 'stopped', 'halfway', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'defective', 'disc', 'was', 'culprit', 'now', 'year', 'half', 'first', 'tried', 'have', 'finally', 'seen', 'whole', 'thing', 'get', 'better', 'not', 'enough', 'so', 'warrant', 'watching', 'again.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'Michael', 'Michael', 'Idemoto', 'auto', 'mechanic', 'who', 'love', 'downstairs', 'neighbor', 'Lori', 'Eugenia', 'Yuan', 'upcoming', 'Slaughter', 'Lori', 'however', 'relationship', 'Justin', 'Matt', 'Westmore', 'TV', 'series', 'Sunset', 'Beach', 'Lori', 'relationship', 'Justin', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'emotional', 'arena', 'unconsciously', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Michael', 'squeezing', 'emotional', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'lacks', 'well', 'good', 'everyone', 'Michael', 'anyway', 'Michael', 'meets', 'Darcy', 'Brokedown', 'Palace', 'Jacqueline', 'Kim', 'neighborhood', 'bar', 'one', 'night', 'Darcy', 'mysterious', 'Michael', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'leading', 'choice', 'realistically', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'make', 'even', 'might', 'not', 'actually', 'mean', 'anything', 'keep', 'pursuing', 'girl', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'pursue', 'one', 'who', 'interested', 'Darcy', 'course', 'Big', 'Secret', 'TM', 'subtext', 'here.Or', 'should', 'anyway', 'Big', 'Reveal', 'Big', 'Secret', 'TM', 'quite', 'letdown', 'really', 'wonder', 'Byler', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'was', 'way', 'interested', 'realism', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'shot', 'sort', 'neo-realistic', 'fashion', 'become', 'popular', 'Dogme-influenced', 'indie', 'scene', 'once', 'untangle', 'twists', 'turns', 'drama', 'have', 'ask', 'how', 'dumb', 'characters', 'have', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'Michael', 'maybe', 'can', 'buy', 'off', 'innocent', 'somewhat', 'sheltered', ""'re"", 'going', 'set', 'up', 'Lori', 'Darcy', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'one', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'least', 'slightly', 'less', 'bad', 'then', 'other', 'Justin', 'maybe', 'can', 'buy', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'thinking', 'wrong', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'here', 'think', 'material', 'may', 'have', 'wanted', 'stronger', 'adaptation', '**']",N/A
