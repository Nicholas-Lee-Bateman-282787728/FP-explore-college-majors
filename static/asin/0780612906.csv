For Instance It Shows How Love can be so tragic,and how life at most times could be unfair.I think Leonardo Dicaprio should have got an oscar for his performance in this movie. Because I Think This Was His Best Acting Performances other Than Gilbert Grape. The Cinematography in this movie was great it seemed to have the manet qualties in like the scene when leonardo passes by this gate which was in one of manet paintings with red haired women sitting down in front of the gate and a little girl looking behind the fence looking at smoke.This Movie Is A masterpiece and i cried in several scenes especially the end when he remebers when he asked him if he loved him and then stabbed him in the hand that to me is how love can sometimes be painful and traggic.

With Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis), the two men indulge their  mutual attraction and hit the road.  Their scandalous laison takes the pair  from bohemian poverty in Paris to London squalor.  Verlaine was already  established in the literary world when he met the sixteen year old Rimbaud,  for whom he threw away his middle class marriage.  Rimbaud as di Caprio  portrays him is self-absorbed and unwilling to bow to the literary  conventions of Romanticism.  Rather, he knows his work stands him apart  from the crowd, and with conviction as much as puffery, Rimbaud's stand  against the status quo result in disaster for Verlaine.  Those who never  read the work of Rimbaud may discover his genius.  Credit goes to di  Caprio's performance which captures the spirit of the age with uncanny  brilliance.  Only eighteen when the film was shot, the actor was about the  same age as Rimbaud, a point not overlooked by director Holland.  Her  camera's presence often fades as the audience is entertained by the  unselfconscious mugging of Leo in the countryside, a technique that recall  old home movies of past summer vacations.  A superb supporting cast,  locations, and historic authenticity of Total Eclipse create a film for  audiences of period drama.  A worthy addition to a video library.

27899,A1IWR4FKPGE95C,0780612906,Carlos Rodriguez,"[23, 30]","This is a great movie and is by far Leonardo DiCaprio best performance yet. He should of won an Oscar for his harrowing portrayal of 19th Century French poet Arthur Rimbaud. Rimbaud was a literary genius at the age of 16, who wrote wonderful and obscure poems about sex and death among other topics.His intense and volatile relationship with fellow poet Paul Verlaine was often times disturbing and mad. Verlaine had trouble accepting the fact that his friend, confidant and lover was extremely gifted and more successful than he ever was.Arthur Rimbaud was a merciful and shrewed young man who found pleasure in getting his way all the time and making other people look ridicule (especially the ones he did not like). Verlaine's young wife could not tolerate him and blamed him for making her husband abandon her for long periods of time. Verlaine would always come back to his wife but found Rimbaud so irresistable that he always ended up doing what he wanted and would succumb to his every need be it emotional or sexual. Arthur always knew had to get Paul wrapped up around his finger and got him to do whatever he wanted atleast most of the time.This film is highlated by great performances from the entire cast and once again it is DiCaprio's remarkable performance that makes this film extremely interesting to watch. I don't think this movie is for everyone especially the ones that only think that a good movie is not good unless someone or something gets blown off. DiCaprio's character goes thru many changes in his appearance especially when he is dying of a terrible disease (I'm sorry but I can't seem to remember which one) his character is both physical and emotional and he plays it with incredible strength and emotion.If you are a serious movie collector this is a ""must have"" for your collection. I love everything about this film and is one of my favorite movies ever. I gave it a 5 star rating because that as high as it goes but I would give a 10 rating because it has all the ingredients a great movie suppose to have.

DiCaprio, while admirable in accepting such a role, is all but unwatchable, in that his  acting is too self-cetered (there is little or no connection to the other  actors) and his character comes off at the beginning as a rude, snotty brat  and goes downhill from there. Thewlis tries to play symapthetic as  Verlaine, but is betrayed by the poor writing. Romane Bohringer, easily the  sole redeeming feature of the film, is in a role too small and unimportant  to make enough of a difference. Worse, while the cinematography is at times  compelling, the direction shows Holland at a career low. There is no  chemistry, no intimacy among the characters, no matter how naked they get.

27903,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0780612906,D. Litton,"[5, 12]","Your interest in the plot of &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; depends largely on whether or not your are able to suspend disbelief for almost two hours and embrace Leonardo DiCaprio as a famous poet; believe me, it's near impossible. This period piece on the highly offbeat romance between two 19th century poets is a hammy, borish, and even aggravating film that becomes so ludicrous in its final hour that Death becomes the character to root for.The movie gets off to a rocky start with Arthur Rimbaud (DiCaprio) venturing to the home of Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis), who also embraces poetry. Despite his pregnant wife's urgings that he stay home for the birth of their child, Verlaine ventures out on the town with his new friend; the two cause a ruckus as a poetry reading, and become lovers of a sort. The story then develops a cycle that involves Verlaine meeting Rimbaud for a night of gratification, then returning home in a drunken stupor to physically torment his wife and even his child.What will ensue is a charybdis of deceit as Verlaine returns to his wife only to leave her for Rimbaud once again, and their descent into depravity, both physically and emotionally. Much of the second half is an attempt to bring out a psychological warfare between Rimbaud's haughty, contemptuous mind and Verlaine's more passive, sensitive state. Instead of being intriguing and thought-provoking, Rimbaud's insults come off as mere insults to our intelligence, and to our hunger for strong material.The movie's biggest problem lies with the characters themselves, who are some of the most successful hate-inducing characters to come along in quite a while. Verlaine is portrayed as little more than a whiny, emotionally needy twit with no sense of reasoning or understanding of his life; even when it comes time for him to take a stand for himself, leaving Rimbaud behind to go on to Brussels, he breaks down and sends for him. His constant blubbering and twisted views of being faithful to one's spouse are completely banal and handled by the screenwriters in all the wrong ways.Rimbaud is the exact opposite of Verlaine, though not in an appealing manner. As previously mentioned, he is shown as being cocky and believes himself to be superior to all other writers for his ability to see the truth in all situations of life. However true (or untrue) this may be to the actual attitude of Rimbaud himself, the movie goes too far with the character; from the very beginning, he is a pest beyond measure, from his carrying-on at the poetry reading to his constant expositories on the meaning of life and the non-existence of love. When it came time for Verlaine to leave him behind, I almost cheered, as I did when his death finally arrived.And just as the characters are boring, the actors bring an equal level of disinterest to the film, most notably DiCaprio. His overindulgence in his character is evident throughout, and he fails to generate any emotion or believable intensity in Rimbaud. Even Thewlis's performance seems forced; he seems to look right through the material and not believe in any of it. Together, the two have little chemistry or intensity, and the romance sours in the wake of their hammy acting.In the end, poor pacing, sloppy characterization, and extremely cumbersome acting bring out the worst that the film has to offer, which is little to begin with. There is a large absence of emotional connectivity between the characters and the audience, a trait that may have added some measure of interest to the story. At one hour and fifty-one minutes, &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; wears out its welcome long before it has introduced itself.",1,I watched &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; so you don't have to.,1005091200,"11 7, 2001",2001,3654,"['interest', 'plot', 'quot', 'Total', 'Eclipse', 'quot', 'largely', 'not', 'are', 'able', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'embrace', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'famous', 'poet', 'believe', 'near', 'impossible', 'period', 'piece', 'highly', 'offbeat', 'romance', 'two', '19th', 'century', 'poets', 'hammy', 'borish', 'even', 'aggravating', 'film', 'so', 'ludicrous', 'final', 'hour', 'Death', 'character', 'root', 'for.The', 'movie', 'off', 'rocky', 'start', 'Arthur', 'Rimbaud', 'DiCaprio', 'venturing', 'home', 'Paul', 'Verlaine', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'who', 'also', 'poetry', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'urgings', 'home', 'birth', 'child', 'Verlaine', 'ventures', 'out', 'town', 'new', 'friend', 'two', 'cause', 'ruckus', 'poetry', 'reading', 'become', 'lovers', 'sort', 'story', 'then', 'cycle', 'Verlaine', 'meeting', 'Rimbaud', 'night', 'gratification', 'then', 'returning', 'home', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'physically', 'torment', 'wife', 'even', 'child.What', 'will', 'ensue', 'charybdis', 'deceit', 'Verlaine', 'wife', 'only', 'leave', 'Rimbaud', 'once', 'again', 'descent', 'depravity', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'Much', 'second', 'half', 'attempt', 'bring', 'out', 'psychological', 'warfare', 'Rimbaud', 'haughty', 'contemptuous', 'mind', 'Verlaine', 'more', 'passive', 'sensitive', 'state', 'Instead', 'being', 'intriguing', 'thought-provoking', 'Rimbaud', 'insults', 'come', 'off', 'mere', 'insults', 'intelligence', 'hunger', 'strong', 'material.The', 'movie', 'biggest', 'problem', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'successful', 'hate-inducing', 'characters', 'come', 'along', 'quite', 'while', 'Verlaine', 'portrayed', 'little', 'more', 'whiny', 'emotionally', 'needy', 'twit', 'sense', 'reasoning', 'understanding', 'life', 'even', 'when', 'time', 'take', 'stand', 'leaving', 'Rimbaud', 'go', 'Brussels', 'down', 'sends', 'constant', 'blubbering', 'twisted', 'views', 'being', 'faithful', 'one', 'spouse', 'are', 'completely', 'banal', 'handled', 'screenwriters', 'wrong', 'ways.Rimbaud', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Verlaine', 'not', 'appealing', 'manner', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'shown', 'being', 'cocky', 'be', 'superior', 'other', 'writers', 'ability', 'see', 'truth', 'situations', 'life', 'However', 'true', 'untrue', 'may', 'be', 'actual', 'attitude', 'Rimbaud', 'movie', 'too', 'far', 'character', 'very', 'beginning', 'pest', 'measure', 'carrying-on', 'poetry', 'reading', 'constant', 'expositories', 'meaning', 'life', 'non-existence', 'love', 'When', 'came', 'time', 'Verlaine', 'leave', 'almost', 'cheered', 'did', 'when', 'death', 'finally', 'arrived.And', 'just', 'characters', 'are', 'boring', 'actors', 'bring', 'equal', 'level', 'disinterest', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'DiCaprio', 'overindulgence', 'character', 'evident', 'generate', 'emotion', 'believable', 'intensity', 'Rimbaud', 'Even', 'Thewlis', 'performance', 'forced', 'look', 'right', 'material', 'not', 'believe', 'Together', 'two', 'have', 'little', 'chemistry', 'intensity', 'romance', 'sours', 'wake', 'hammy', 'end', 'poor', 'pacing', 'sloppy', 'characterization', 'extremely', 'cumbersome', 'acting', 'bring', 'out', 'worst', 'film', 'offer', 'little', 'begin', 'large', 'absence', 'emotional', 'connectivity', 'characters', 'audience', 'trait', 'may', 'have', 'added', 'measure', 'interest', 'story', 'one', 'hour', 'fifty-one', 'minutes', 'quot', 'Total', 'Eclipse', 'quot', 'out', 'welcome', 'long', 'introduced']",N/A

More than that, a little research into the ""truth"" leaves the reader with the same idea.  For example, Rimbaud's life has been extensively documented inRimbaud: A Biography, where Rimbaud comes off as even more creepy than he does in this film.  Verlaine is hardly an admirable figure, given his brutal mistreatment of his wife, and his weepy drunken Catholicism, not to mention his weepy worship of the teenage ""god"" Rimbaud.However, I must say that when I went back to watch this film again (with teeth clenched), I saw something different: a tale of a gigantic passion between two deeply flawed men.  And that means that the film captures a very important thing: the historical truth.  It may strike us as ""unbelievable,"" but that's the way this mad passion played out.This is probably Leonardo's best performance.  The fact that he was superbly cast doesn't hurt a bit either.  That is to say, if you want the audience to believe the idea that Paul Verlaine would abandon his pretty young wife for some unknown boy from the provinces, it helps to have a wildly attractive actor playing the part of the boy from the provinces.  :-)",5,An unpleasant masterpiece,987379200,"04 16, 2001",2001,1267,"['first', 'look', 'film', 'left', 'depressed', 'main', 'characters', 'gave', 'enormous', 'proof', 'were', 'well', 'creeps', 'More', 'little', 'research', 'truth', 'reader', 'same', 'idea', 'example', 'Rimbaud', 'life', 'been', 'extensively', 'documented', 'inRimbaud', 'Biography', 'where', 'Rimbaud', 'off', 'even', 'more', 'creepy', 'film', 'Verlaine', 'hardly', 'admirable', 'figure', 'given', 'brutal', 'mistreatment', 'wife', 'weepy', 'drunken', 'Catholicism', 'not', 'mention', 'weepy', 'worship', 'teenage', 'god', 'Rimbaud.However', 'must', 'say', 'when', 'went', 'back', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'teeth', 'clenched', 'saw', 'something', 'different', 'tale', 'gigantic', 'passion', 'two', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'men', 'film', 'very', 'important', 'thing', 'historical', 'truth', 'may', 'strike', 'unbelievable', 'way', 'mad', 'passion', 'played', 'out.This', 'probably', 'Leonardo', 'best', 'performance', 'fact', 'was', 'superbly', 'cast', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'bit', 'either', 'say', 'want', 'audience', 'believe', 'idea', 'Paul', 'Verlaine', 'would', 'abandon', 'pretty', 'young', 'wife', 'unknown', 'boy', 'provinces', 'have', 'wildly', 'attractive', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'boy', 'provinces']",N/A

(-:  It was like the crack cocaine of it's day!They make ravenous love, drink, get high, shock & scandalize polite Paris society,and Verlaine, in an allebriated state, becomes very cruel to his wife and newborn child.I didn't understand his cruelty towards her, because she was very supportive.She notices that her husband and Rimbaud are in love, which was a crimepunishable by imprisonment at that time, and she does everything she can tokeep his interest. But what he and Rimbaud share is just too addictive for himto leave alone, and the two disappear across Europe, with Verlaine paying the way!Soon he begins to see Rimbaud's darkside, very mercurial and cruel mood-swings,and their relationship takes on an abusive tint. After a particularly brutalverbal fight, he leaves Rimbaud in London, but then takes him back a few days later.Their crazy self-destructive but passionate relationship continues to spiral downwards forVerlaine, whose wife finally gets tired of his disrespect and divorces him on chargesof immoral conduct and neglect. After his money runs out, so soon does Rimbaud follow.Rimbaud returns to his family in the countryside of northen France and completesone last literary masterwork before withdrawing from writing poetry altogetherat the age of 21. He says that he's said all he had to say.He travels abroad and winds up in Northern Africa, where he engages in heterosexualrelations with several native women, but one in particular who he claims as his mistress.As for Verlaine, he is not only left heart-broken, but near destitute.He turns himself over to authorities who subject him to a demoralizingphysical examination to see if he has been both a passive and active memberin homosexual activities or ""buggery"" as it was known back then.He is imprisoned for two years and upon his release, tries to find Rimbaudagain to hopefully reconnect their love, but to no avail because Rimbaud has moved on.Years pass and Rimbaud develops cancer in his leg, has it amputated, then diessoon after at the young age of 37 in 1891.But he put 85 years of life experience into that 37 years and his effecton those he left behind in his time, as well as in music, art and pop culture100-plus years into the future is immeasurable!The quintessential tortured anti-social self-destructive genius who walks to his own drummer.And many since have been lured by his strange lyrical rhythms and poeticvisuals that were far ahead of their time!His gift was apparently infinite in it's reach!This is a brilliant biopic and Leo DiCaprio and David Thewlis nailed it!

And this was before Titanic.  But it's such a good story.  I just saw it again over the holidays for the first time since the 90s and it's still as good as I remember.  Unfortunately, I don't think this movie ever got the recognition it deserved because a lot of Leo fans get extreme about it.The film follows the very volatile yet creative and passionate relationship between two 19th century French poets, Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis) and Arthur Rimbaud (Leonardo DiCaprio).  Paul is older and married, but when he invites the teenaged Rimbaud to come stay with him after reading some of his work, all hell breaks loose in his life.  Verlaine is an established lyrical poet... Rimbaud has emerged with something altogether new and is ahead of his time.  And he knows it.  He's ill-mannered, arrogant, and wild.  Off they go on a drunken, reckless, and somewhat sadistic crazy train.I didn't rate it 5 stars because even though their reckless relationship was fun to watch, I really wanted to see more of their creative process at work.  Rimbaud had a very bright mind... he would do all the work he had to offer the world as a teenager and gave up creative writing entirely before the age of 20.  Verlaine could recognize as much and once questioned Rimbaud as to why he needs him.  He tells Verlaine, ""I've always known what to say... you know HOW to say it.""  I really wanted to see more of that and hear more of their work.  But the madness behind it all and the love that inspired them both is still something to see.

This film is wonderful if you are a gay male and you fancy sleeping with a 22 year old Leonardo Di Caprio. It will fulfill endless hours of fantasy, although it would better have been directed by Jean Daniel Cadinot and the sex scenes involving Thewlis and Di Caprio made absolutely explicit and hardcore.  Given Di Caprio's warm hearted good ol'America's image doing this would at least have preserved some of Rimbaud's radicality for the modern audience of American or pro-American culture, potentially confronting and scandalising the viewer today the way his poetry did in the 19th and early 20th centuries. I guess we just aren't advanced or sophisticated enough to handle that. Like Max Ernst painting the Virgin Mary spanking Jesus this film should have at least done something to honour the iconoclasm of this great progenitor of surrealism. Instead, once again, we are given a film that stands as a monument to an actor rather than an artist.  Like Kirk Douglas playing Van Gogh or Charleton Heston playing Michelangelo this film is pure hollywood cultural revisionism.  Aside from that the costumes are nice, the acting besides that done by Leonardo Di Caprio is good, and the concept is ok.  David Thewlis does honour to Verlaine, although I'm sure he could have done a better job with a proper script and a better Rimbaud. Di Caprio does portray a teenage rebel but not enough of one to make a convincing Rimbaud.  Its like watching Tinky-winky from the telly tubbies melting into a character from TV's ""Will and Grace"".

If you are looking for something to replace the Rocky Horror Picture Show for a good campy laugh, this is your movie.  The entire thing was beyond ridiculous.  There was no chemistry between DiCaprio and Thewlis, no hint at what would have pulled these two together in an age when the very hint of such a relationship could have been, and in fact was, the ruin of the elder Paul Verlaine (Thewlis).  The anorexic appearance of both actors (and let's face it folks, when is the cinematic world going to get it that they must never let Thewlis remove his clothes on camera?)and the scene of intimacy between them bring to mind the words brutal, abusive, sadistic and horrific.  That having been said, be prepared to move quickly from being appalled to laughing riotously at all the wrong places.  From crawling around imitating goats (yes there were real goats there too) to the frequent frontal nudity displayed by DiCaprio and Thewlis, there are giggles aplenty.

27920,A152C8GYY25HAH,0780612906,Matthew Horner,"[19, 27]","This movie about the steamy, stormy relationship between early 20th Century French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine fails on a number of levels. Considering the talent involved in front of and behind the camera, the film is a bit of am embarrassment.Verlaine was a widely respected poet when he invited the very young [16 or 17] to visit him and his family in Paris. They developed a volatile friendship that became a torrid love affair. In the process, they destroyed Verlaine's marriage and reputation. Their escapades also cost him two years in prison. Rimbaud wrote brilliantly but only for a few years. He wound up gun running in Africa and died of cancer in his mid-30s.Their tale has the makings of a powerful drama, but ""Total Eclipse"" forgoes this opportunity by focusing on the more shocking aspects of the relationship. In the process, both characters come off as vain and selfish. In Rimbaud's case, this can perhaps be justified by his youth, his genius and his homosexuality in a repressed society. An actor such as Ewan McGregor might have pulled the role off, but Leonardo DiCaprio, though excellent in several other movies, seems lost here because his anger and angst feels like that of a California kid. David Thewlis is also up the creek, but for a different reason. As written, his Verlaine is so smarmy and reprehensible that he's impossible to relate to. After a scene of horrendous cruelty towards his wife and infant, one wishes he would go ahead with his threats to blow his brains out.There is zero chemistry between DiCaprio and Thewlis. This makes is hard to figure out what attracted the two poets to each other, especially since little is made of their intellectual bond.Perhaps the biggest mistake the movie makes is to assume that the audience will give the characters a break because they are artists. This is problem because there are few direct references to the poetry that made them famous. In ""Amadeus"", we also were presented with a crass, prissy, childish genius as the central character. That movie succeeded because Mozart's glorious music was featured throughout and because there was a great deal of humor.

27922,A3KDC5EZSA8AZJ,0780612906,"Menachem Rephun ""Billy Sluthers McShea""","[3, 9]","Arthur Rimbaud, the nineteenth-century poet, prodigy, and mystic who composed almost all his writings before the age of eighteen, and whose literary and aesthetic doctrine that a poet must degrade and sublimate his personality in order to become ''a visionary'', or one who can percieve the infinite and speak with the voice of a God, was crucial in shaping the development of literature in the twentieth century, was truly an ingenious writer, and person.The same cannot, unfortunately, be said for the screenwriter and director of ""Total Eclipse"", who have taken the biography of this unique, fascinating individual and transformed it into a nineteenth century ""Jerry Springer"" of sorts. The movie is, admittedly, historically accurate, at least in most respects. That is not it's primary fault. But it suffers from a number of significant shortcomings in other areas which make it not simply a dissapointingly mediocre, annoying film, but an insult to admirers of Rimbaud as well.One of the main problems of ""Total Eclipse"" is it's star. Not neccessarily his acting,in this case: but simply his presence. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply too familiar a face, and his portrayal of the young Rimbaud as nothing less than a hateful, boorish, monster is beyond offensive. Not to deny that Rimbaud was without shortcomings: indeed, he is known as much for his poetry as for his strange and explosive personality. Yet the movie's excessively negative portrayal of the poet would be more tolerable if it provided any insight into his poetry, which it unforgivably fails to do. Throughout the movie, Rimbaud's writing is reduced to a mere footnote: we are assured numerous times of his genius, yet are not even informed of the titles of his most significant works, namely, ""Le Bateau Ivre (The Drunken Boat) ''Illuminations'', and ""Un Saison En Enfer"" (A Season in Hell)."" No. What we get instead, as in most big-budget Hollywood productions, is a sensationalized biography in which the truly important aspects of Rimbaud's life are, as the film's title would suggest, totally eclipsed, by incidents (specifically, the alleged homosexual love affair between Rimbaud and the older poet Paul Verlaine, which, though not without importance, occupies the entire focus of the film) which would appear, today, in a supermarket tabloid.''Total Eclipse'' feels, throughout, like a lazy, slapdash effort, starting with a few half-hearted attempts to ennumerate Rimbaud's philosophy and culminating as a series of petty, melodramatic squabbles between the central characters. And yet, just like a middle-brow soap opera, or an episode of ""Jerry Springer"", the movie is sometimes guiltily compelling, such as when Rimbaud decries another poet's work and creates havoc by urinating on his writing (another example of an event shamelessly exaggerated in order to appeal to John Q.

Rimbaud wrote to many poets before Verlaine ""bit"".  The issue of homosexuality was probably more Verlaine than Rimbaud - Verlaine went on to have other male lovers; Rimbaud didn't.  The narrative is also quite far off.  Rimbaud lived to 37; the film implies he died much younger.  Those are important points, but my main issue is with the fact that this is a story about two very important poets, and there is not one scrap of their poetry in the film.  It isn't as if there isn't time; we get shots of trains travelling through the countryside for no good reason, but no poems.
