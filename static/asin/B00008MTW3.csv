745200,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00008MTW3,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[12, 12]","Hampered by a somewhat lame script and perhaps not enough high wattage star power to head the cast, this epic is nevertheless quite watchable; based on actual events in the 480 B.C. Battle of Thermopylae, where a King Leonides of Sparta held the vast Persian army of Xerxes I at bay for three days defending a narrow pass.The battles are brilliantly staged with its 1001 extras, in massive mano a mano fights, as well as on horseback and in chariots.A secondary plot consists of a young couple (Diane Baker and Barry Coe) in love against all odds, and are the diversion to an otherwise rather one-note story of Spartans/Greeks vs. Persians.Richard Egan ably leads his men as Leonides the Lion King of Sparta, but somehow does not have the stature as an actor to really captivate our attention, and other actors include Ralph Richardson as Themistocles of Athens, and David Farrar as Xerxes I.The cinematography by Geoffrey Unger (""2001: A Space Odyssey"") is spectacular, and the transfer to DVD excellent with rich reds in the costumes and the deepest of blue seas, and the score by Manos Hadjidakis (""Never on Sunday"") is marvelous and adds a lot to the film.Director Rudolph Mate had a long career as a brilliant cinematographer going back to the silent film era with the 1928 masterpiece ""Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" to later films like ""Pride of the Yankees"", and this was to be his next to last film as a director.One can learn history even from a Hollywood epic, as I never knew of the existence of Artemisia the Warrior Queen of Halicarnassus, here played by Anne Wakefield. When I first watched the film, I assumed she had been included to add some female pulchritude to the action, but upon some reading on the subject after viewing the film, learned she had ruled after her husband's death and was an ally to Xerxes I in 480 B.C., taking part in the Battle of Salamis, and cleverly maneuvering to safety when the battle was lost. Herodotus even gave her the rare praise of having ""the virtue of courage"", normally only bestowed on men, as it also meant ""manliness"".Well worth watching for its historical accuracy, battle scenes, terrific costuming, beautiful scenery and score, so that though the film is not particularly involving, it has quite a lot to offer.DVD extras include the theatrical trailer, and total running time is 114 minutes.",4,"sharp swords, dull dialogue, and some good history",1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,2349,"['Hampered', 'somewhat', 'lame', 'script', 'perhaps', 'not', 'enough', 'high', 'wattage', 'star', 'power', 'head', 'cast', 'epic', 'nevertheless', 'quite', 'watchable', 'based', 'actual', 'events', '480', 'B.C', 'Battle', 'Thermopylae', 'where', 'King', 'Leonides', 'Sparta', 'held', 'vast', 'Persian', 'army', 'Xerxes', 'bay', 'three', 'days', 'defending', 'narrow', 'pass.The', 'battles', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'staged', '1001', 'extras', 'massive', 'mano', 'mano', 'fights', 'as', 'well', 'horseback', 'chariots.A', 'secondary', 'plot', 'young', 'couple', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Barry', 'Coe', 'love', 'odds', 'are', 'diversion', 'otherwise', 'rather', 'one-note', 'story', 'Spartans/Greeks', 'vs.', 'Persians.Richard', 'Egan', 'ably', 'men', 'Leonides', 'Lion', 'King', 'Sparta', 'somehow', 'not', 'have', 'stature', 'actor', 'really', 'captivate', 'attention', 'other', 'actors', 'include', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Themistocles', 'Athens', 'David', 'Farrar', 'Xerxes', 'I.The', 'cinematography', 'Geoffrey', 'Unger', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'spectacular', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'rich', 'reds', 'costumes', 'deepest', 'blue', 'seas', 'score', 'Manos', 'Hadjidakis', 'Never', 'Sunday', 'marvelous', 'lot', 'film.Director', 'Rudolph', 'Mate', 'had', 'long', 'career', 'brilliant', 'cinematographer', 'going', 'back', 'silent', 'film', 'era', '1928', 'masterpiece', 'Passion', 'de', 'Jeanne', ""d'Arc"", 'later', 'films', 'Pride', 'Yankees', 'was', 'be', 'next', 'last', 'film', 'director.One', 'can', 'learn', 'history', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'never', 'knew', 'existence', 'Artemisia', 'Warrior', 'Queen', 'Halicarnassus', 'here', 'played', 'Anne', 'Wakefield', 'When', 'first', 'watched', 'film', 'assumed', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'add', 'female', 'pulchritude', 'action', 'reading', 'subject', 'viewing', 'film', 'learned', 'had', 'ruled', 'husband', 'death', 'was', 'ally', 'Xerxes', '480', 'B.C.', 'taking', 'part', 'Battle', 'Salamis', 'cleverly', 'maneuvering', 'safety', 'when', 'battle', 'was', 'lost', 'Herodotus', 'even', 'gave', 'rare', 'praise', 'having', 'virtue', 'courage', 'normally', 'only', 'bestowed', 'men', 'also', 'meant', 'manliness', '.Well', 'watching', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'battle', 'scenes', 'terrific', 'costuming', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'score', 'film', 'not', 'particularly', 'involving', 'quite', 'lot', 'offer.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'total', 'running', 'time', '114', 'minutes']",N/A

745202,A2SHF3F8N7HGS3,B00008MTW3,"Allen Eaton ""aleaton3""","[4, 4]","Many of us grew up on these Hollywood 'epics' of ancient history.  We remember them fondly.  &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot; is one such film.  Our memories, however, can play tricks on us.  Then we see them again as we age, and our opinions change.  We have to remember the times in which they were made and the type of audience that eagerly went to see them.As a widescreen epic (and you have to see it in the 2:35x1 aspect ratio which the DVD presents), it stills holds some strange fascination.Sir Ralph Richardson is the one stand-out performance; somehow, British actors seem to be able to deliver stilted dialog in such a way that it seems somehow classical.  Richard Egan was also a good actor.  As the Spartan king, his performance is consistant and even believable.  He is rugged-looking and seems to understand what his character is all about.  He brings the character on the page to some sembelence of life.The rest of the cast make their characters seem cut from a comic book, or a very bad high-school production.  This is especially true of David Farrar as the Persian King, who tears up the screen without once delving beneath the skin to give his role any dimension.  These are supposedly professional actors, able to rise above a bad script.  Unfortunately, the director accepted only fair performances and let it go at that.Barry Coe and Diane Baker have the unfortunate roles of the young lovers.  They were both young contract players at Fox and neither convinced anyone that they were either Spartans or that they were ever actually in love. Mr. Coe has one unfornutate line: &quot;Have you heard anything about the Persians?&quot;  He delivers this like a football player asking his coach about the opposing team.The script does present the story's history with fair accuracy.  Once the Spartans get on the march, the pace picks up nicely, and the battle scenes are well staged.  As usually happened with these epics, the production values of the behind-the-camera talent clearly outshone those being photographed.",3,Memory vs now,1084320000,"05 12, 2004",2004,2034,"['Many', 'grew', 'up', 'Hollywood', ""'epics"", 'ancient', 'history', 'remember', 'fondly', 'quot', '300', 'Spartans', 'quot', 'one', 'such', 'film', 'memories', 'however', 'can', 'play', 'tricks', 'Then', 'see', 'again', 'age', 'opinions', 'change', 'have', 'remember', 'times', 'were', 'made', 'type', 'audience', 'eagerly', 'went', 'see', 'them.As', 'widescreen', 'epic', 'have', 'see', '2:35x1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'DVD', 'presents', 'strange', 'fascination.Sir', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'one', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'somehow', 'British', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'deliver', 'stilted', 'dialog', 'such', 'way', 'somehow', 'classical', 'Richard', 'Egan', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'actor', 'Spartan', 'king', 'performance', 'consistant', 'even', 'believable', 'rugged-looking', 'understand', 'what', 'character', 'about', 'character', 'page', 'sembelence', 'life.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'make', 'characters', 'seem', 'cut', 'comic', 'book', 'very', 'bad', 'high-school', 'production', 'especially', 'true', 'David', 'Farrar', 'Persian', 'King', 'who', 'screen', 'once', 'delving', 'skin', 'give', 'role', 'dimension', 'are', 'supposedly', 'professional', 'actors', 'able', 'rise', 'bad', 'script', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'accepted', 'only', 'fair', 'performances', 'let', 'go', 'that.Barry', 'Coe', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'have', 'unfortunate', 'roles', 'young', 'lovers', 'were', 'young', 'contract', 'players', 'Fox', 'neither', 'convinced', 'anyone', 'were', 'Spartans', 'were', 'ever', 'actually', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Coe', 'one', 'unfornutate', 'line', 'quot', 'Have', 'heard', 'anything', 'Persians', 'quot', 'football', 'player', 'asking', 'coach', 'opposing', 'team.The', 'script', 'present', 'story', 'history', 'fair', 'accuracy', 'Spartans', 'get', 'march', 'pace', 'up', 'nicely', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'staged', 'usually', 'happened', 'epics', 'production', 'values', 'behind-the-camera', 'talent', 'clearly', 'outshone', 'being', 'photographed']",N/A

745204,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00008MTW3,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[4, 4]","The only reason I have not heaped more stars on this 1961 classic is the lack of extra's on the DVD, although the Widescreen reproduction is good, the picture and sound crisp, and overall a great package. Recently referred to in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; whilst drawing parallels of futile &quot;last stands&quot;, this movie is beginning to attract a new audience, as well as enthrall those who remember it the first time around. With the renewed interest in the genre (Troy / Alexander the Great) at theaters now, and in post production respectively, this is a timely release. Another plus is that this movie is seldom seen on countless reruns on TV like so many, and is a worthy addition to any fans collection. In a similar way to Troy, there is an air of inevitability to the story which heads for the ill fated battle at Thermopylae. Some policital bungling and bad planning pits Richard Egan and his elite but small army against the ravages of Xerxes (he who commanded an army of 1,000,000)at the aforementioned pass, and the end result though predictable is stirring. Some interesting metaphors abound (as was the practice at that time) comparing the political problems of 1961 to the historical aspects of the movie, but otherwise this is a solid picture. The battle sequences are a bit tame by todays standards, but there is a wonderful dramatic quality to the direction and script, often missing in todays CGI festooned reproductions.

745205,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00008MTW3,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[5, 33]","SpoilersWith money boiling a hole in my pocket and in desperate search of some Ancient Rome/Greek movies, I picked up this one. I initially thought it was 44.95!!! Turns out it was just a trick of the plastic cage-thingy protecting it from theft, that made the 1 look like 4. Same thing with the store's copy of ""Spartacus"" which I didn't buy because I somehow thought it was 44.95 and that it was a bit of a ripoff (I'm a little crazy) So I bought this at the last moment, and wasted some but not much time watching it. I was very impressed with the cinematography considering this was a movie from the 60s, and the costumes were very realistic. As expected, all the Greeks (and Xerxes) had British accents, and Xerxes was very un-Persian looking and sounding. Still, I was a bit impressed with the rapid pace of the movie without rushing too badly, and the very dedicated acting.Then as the movie went on, I kind of did that face that goes :S First off, the music was terrible (but I don't hold it against it, since all Ancient Rome/Greece movies from the 60s and such had really whiny, tinny brass instruments that were very un-Roman/un-Greek sounding.) Then came Leonidas. First, they mispronounced his name, I think (I'm sure his name is pronounced ""Lee-oh-ny-dus"", whereas they all pronounced it ""Lee-oh-nee-dus""), and he had an American ACCENT!! Omg, after getting sick and tired of people who bitched about 2004's ""Alexander"" with the Greeks having Irish accents, imagine my surprise to hear Spartans talk with American accents. Most of the Spartans had American accents, with some varying between British and American seemingly randomly.After Athens allied with Sparta to pin the Persians at Thermopylae, the movie slugged to a virtual halt for a whole 20 minutes or so, with Leonidas constantly talking about Thermopylae, but no one doing anything, and some Spartan kid being disgraced and kicked out of the army.Once they finally reached Thermopylae (and the Spartan kid (kid about 30 years old) earning his spot back in the army to fight the suicide mission), the movie started to pick up again. I was very impressed in how the movie kept itself reined in to realism, when it appeared about to slip into mad-Hollywood-action-movie chaos. Rather than make the situation appear heroic, with only 300 Spartans, they did point out and make it a priority to tell the audience that the Spartans were not alone. Greeks (mostly from Thespia) had also joined them.The battle sequences were done pretty well considering it was the 60s. The one thing I hate about old movie battles is that they always show battle sequences sans music at all. So the battle sequences had no music unless something dramatic was happening to shift the battle. The Phalanx was all wrong, however, with the Spartan spears being VERY short--too short for a successful phalanx--and held over their shoulders like throwing spears. Many of the Spartans resorted to sword-fighting as soon as they met the Persian infantry. However, rather than have the Spartans break off and start going ""Gladiator"" one-man-army on the Persians, they held position and moved as a unit. I was very impressed by this realistic approach. (Side note, there was no Dienekes, so they made Leonidas say that legendary quote ""If the arrows of the Medes blot out the sun, we shall have our fight in the shade"" along with some other clever, very Spartan remarks to the Persian commander when ordered to surrender.)The ending however was anti-climactic. As the Spartans sent the Greeks home and prepared to fight to the death, there was no music at all, and when the final battle occurred, when Leonidas was killed, they played some annoying blatty brass music. Then it ended. Then the rest of the scene consisted of the Spartans bunching together with shields up, a Persian commander ordering the archers to shoot them down, and all the Spartans being killed without even moving or even trying to block, and no music. As soon as the last Spartan dropped dead, the narrator came back to tell us of what would happen next, with the Athenian fleet crushing Xerxes later on at Salamis. And it was over, after reiterating the famous quote ""Go and tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here, obedient to their laws we lie."" except that the narrator said it all wrong and weirdy, like ""Stranger passing by, go tell the Spartans we're lying here.""All in all, it was pretty lousy by our standards, but for a movie of the 60s, it was probably bordering on the below average.  It gets a C+ for effort.  At least they pronounced most of the names correctly. And the DVD cover was very pretty.",1,"By our standards, truly terrible.

745213,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00008MTW3,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[25, 25]","Here is a credible portrayal of the heroic stand that the 300 Spartans made at the pass of Thermopylae in 480BCE.  Trying to make their way through the pass was a Persian army that likely numbered around 200,000.  It was led by king Xerxes, son of Darius.The Persians were set on conquering Greece, and Xerxes was out for revenge.  10 years earlier, in 490BCE Darius had launched an ill-fated invasion force that was turned back at Marathon.  This time, Xerxes believed he had a large enough army that the outcome of the war between Greece and Persia would not be in doubt.Unfortunately for Xerxes, he had never faced a fighting force of the like fielded by the Spartans.  The valiant Lacedamons along with a handful of Greek coalition forces held the pass for the better part of 3 days.On the third day, the Spartan king Leonidas dismissed the rest of the Greek forces so that they would live to fight another day.  The Thespians declined to leave and they stayed and fought to a last man alongside the Spartans.It is this obstinate and awe-inspiring battle that is depicted in the film.  All-in-all, it is quite well done and does a reputable job of introducing most of the major characters in the period such as Themosticles, Leonidas, Xerxes, Mardonious, Aspasia and Ephialtes.The best part of the film lies in its authenticity regarding Spartan battle dress and weaponry.  In the film the Spartan shields have an upside down &quot;V,&quot; which was the symbol of the Homoioi (full citizens).  This was, in fact, what their shield depicted.The Laconians had a long (roughly 8 foot) spear + a short-sword, and this is what the actors wielded.  The Spartans also wore red to (supposedly) hide their blood, and this is accurately brought out in the film as well.On the downside, there are a few weak parts of the script.  The most egregious is an anachronism;  Mardonious informs Xerxes that the Spartans &quot;fight like machines.&quot;There are also some directorial lapses and a few spots where armies are supposed to be in close combat and yet the extras move so slowly that you think they don't have a care in the world.  I rather doubt the tension at Thermopylae 2,500 years ago would allow for such insouciance.The acting is fairly good.  Richard Egan gives a solid performance as the venerable Leonidas.  The Xerxes in the film is not, I would think, too far removed from the actual pompous king who invaded Greece all those centuries ago.Aside from all that, the primary reason one should buy this DVD is that it is real history.  While some of it is fabricated and fudged, it is nevertheless an excellent representation of what really happened.  To this day, to commemorate those three days in August of 480BCE there is an epigraph at Thermopylae.  Translated into English, it reads thus:GO TELL THE SPARTANS, STRANGER PASSING BYTHAT HERE OBEDIENT TO THEIR LAWS WE LIE.",4,Your spear is for yourself.

745214,A28B47KE7UJDZH,B00008MTW3,e1x56u$*w#,"[22, 23]","I have fond memories of seeing this movie often in my youth, back in the days when a character called Barry Lillis used to host WGRZ Buffalo's after-school ""Money Movie"". They used to devote a whole week at a time to the genre along with other classic sword'n'sandal epics like the Steve Reeves flicks, etc. While the historical accuracy of some of these movies may be questionable, I have to say they really opened up my young eyes to ancient history and sparked an interest which has stayed with me to this day.Now watching this movie again for the first time in 25 years or so, like many other reviewers here it isn't quite as wonderful as I remembered. But compared to other Italian-made B-movie epics of the time, I would say this production with American, British, French and Greek involvement is still a cut above.Richard Egan makes a decent Leonidas (--OK maybe a bit wooden, but hey it's a B-movie, right?), and keeps the film firmly anchored. But I did find the Shakespearean thespian British accents of some of the other actors made some of these ancient Greeks and Persians seem more like genteel English gentlemen to me (--in particular the actor playing Xerxes, whose blue eyes didn't help his believability either.) And then of course the filmmakers had to go and throw in a sappy love story that doesn't really serve any purpose.Well, what can I say? If you go into this expecting a ""Gladiator"" or even a ""Ben Hur"", you'll probably be disappointed. But if you take it for what it is -- a typical early 60's grade-B sword'n'sandal flick -- you'll find it's a damned good one at that. Probably that's why there are so many of us who, even recognizing that the film is very much of its era and does have its shortcomings, are still so glad to finally have it available on DVD to own and watch anytime.As for the DVD itself, they have done a beau~tiful job restoring the colours and it really looks great. And best of all the film is presented in wide-screen format, which is not done often enough in DVD releases of this type of movie. Don't expect too much in the way of extras (the English and Spanish trailers plus a few old B & W TV spots), but for me having this movie so respectfully restored and released in widescreen is reason enough to be happy.I don't know....say what you will, but even though they're cheesy and dated, somehow I still think I'd rather watch one of these old sword'n'sandal type movies starring a Steve Reeves or a Richard Egan instead of one of today's big-budget, over-hyped ""blockbusters"" starring the latest overpaid ""hot stars"" of the day like Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom.

It is the epic story of the ancient Greeks attempt to hold the mountain pass at Thermopylae vs, at least, one hundred thousand Persians. There were more than 300 spartans there, I believe about 3000 total soldiers from various Greek states made up the force lead by the Spartans. This is sort of the Greek version of ""The Alamo"". Of coarse, the DVD has yet to be released. But here's what I remember;-Not what most would consider a great film, but it tells the story of the battle without being insulting.-If you like great acting, forget it. The acting is adequate.-You think the Persians (Iranians plus troops from various conquered nations) are being slighted concerning their fighting skills(typical hollywood bias) but the Greeks had many advantages over their arch rivals. It's pretty realistic.-About 3 quarters of the film concerns the actual battle and manuevers made. You'd better like sword-play action.-The film, overall, is done well. It is in epic scale.-This is one of 2 films I can recall concerning ancient Greek history.-The other is ""Alexander the Great"" which also has not been released for about 15 years (VHS).If they release this in PS version I will be seriously angry. I have never viewed this movie in it's natural format. This film hasn't been out in VHS, let alone DVD. 15 years of wait, I hope they get it right.

745220,A1VFKMHY42W2O3,B00008MTW3,"George R Dekle ""Bob Dekle""","[50, 53]","'300 Spartans' is nothing if not a B movie. Production values were mediocre for the 60's and downright archaic for today. Acting was on a par with the old Steve Reeves 'Hercules' movies, that is to say wooden. But '300 Spartans,' as poorly made as it was, tells a marvelous story.I first read the story of Leonidas at Thermopylae over 45 years ago in volume 8 of Collier's 'The New Junior Classics: Stories from History,' and that became the germ of a lifelong interest in ancient history and pregunpowder military history. I next met Leonidas in the pages of J.B. Bury's 'A History of Greece,' and A.R. Burns' 'Persia and the Greeks,' and I've recently renewed my acquaintance in Peter Greene's 'The Greco-Persian Wars' and Ernle Bradford's 'Thermopylae.' All of those books save the first can be purchased from Amazon.com. A public domain reprint of the first may be available from Amazon.com under the title 'Stories from Greece and Rome, Junior Classics Part 3.'In brief, the story of Leonidas:As Xerxes (aka Ahasueras), the Great King of the greatest empire the world had ever seen, prepared the greatest invasion force ever mustered, the Greeks sought advice from the Oracle at Delphi. The Oracle pronounced that wooden walls would save Athens, but only the death of a Spartan king would save that unwalled city from ruin.As the Persian juggernaut crossed over a two mile long pontoon bridge into Europe and began its relentless march into Greece, the Greeks temporized, argued, and dithered. Finally, Sparta sent King Leonidas with three hundred Spartiates to hold the pass at Thermopylae against the Persian hordes. Leonidas stiffened his contingent with Helots (Spartan serfs) and volunteers from several other Greek city-states. Phocis, Thebes, Thespia, and a few others swelled Leonidas' ranks to a few thousand.Upon being told that when the Persians loosed their arrows the sky went black, the Spartiate Dienekes rejoined &quot;Then we shall fight in the shade.&quot; At a point in the pass no more than 20 yards wide Leonidas met the Persians and stopped them dead in their tracks. For three days he and his men held the mightiest empire's mightiest army at bay, slaughtering the flower of the Persian army by the hundreds, if not thousands. He might have held, but a traitorous Greek showed the Persians a mountain pass by which they could turn Leonidas' position.Leonidas had guarded the pass with 1,000 Phocians, but the Persian 'Immortals,' Xerxes' best unit, brushed them aside. Upon learning of this treachery, Leonidas sent the other city-states' contingents home and prepared for his last stand. The Thebans and Thespians volunteered to stay, and Leonidas chose for his battleground a wider section of the pass. He wanted as wide a front as possible so he could kill as many Persians as possible.The Spartans joined battle with the Persians for the last time, and the slaughter was horrific. When, as anticipated, the Immortals took them in the rear, the Spartans retreated to a hillock, formed what the Middle Ages would call a 'Swiss Hedgehog,' and died to the last man.As prophecy foretold, the Spartans lost their king, but saved their city, and the rest of Greece with it. The invasion continued apace, and Athens was sacked, with her entire population fleeing to the island of Salamis. There in the straits between Salamis and Athens, the Greeks lured the Persian navy to its doom. Later, on the plains of Plataea, Sparta avenged the death of their king by slaughtering the Persian army and ending once and for all the Persian threat.'300 Spartans' follows this plot remarkably well, failing only in authenticity of detail. In the light of modern depictions of pregunpowder battle in movies like 'Ran,' 'Braveheart,' and 'Gladiator,' the battle scenes were near laughable, but we must remember the budgetary and special effects limitations of a 60's era B movie.The movie got more right than it did wrong: The dithering of the Greeks, the insanity of Leonidas' march, the gritty determination and martial excellence of the Spartiate soldiers, the hubris of Xerxes, the death by archery of the Spartiates as they formed a Swiss Hedghog for their final stand, but most of all the heroic person of Leonidas the king who willingly laid down his life to save his city-state and all of Greece with it.Richard Egan is probably best known for his portrayal of the villianous gladiator who was Victor Mature's foe in 'Demetrius and the Gladiators.' He makes a better villian than he does a hero, but there was still something very engaging in his portrayal of the heroic but doomed Spartan King.",5,B Movie -- A Story,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,4613,"[""'300"", 'Spartans', 'nothing', 'not', 'B', 'movie', 'Production', 'values', 'were', 'mediocre', '60', 'downright', 'archaic', 'today', 'Acting', 'was', 'par', 'old', 'Steve', 'Reeves', 'movies', 'say', 'wooden', ""'300"", 'Spartans', 'poorly', 'made', 'was', 'marvelous', 'story.I', 'first', 'read', 'story', 'Leonidas', 'Thermopylae', '45', 'years', 'ago', 'volume', '8', 'Collier', ""'The"", 'New', 'Junior', 'Classics', 'Stories', 'History', 'became', 'germ', 'lifelong', 'interest', 'ancient', 'history', 'pregunpowder', 'military', 'history', 'next', 'met', 'Leonidas', 'pages', 'J.B', 'Bury', 'A', 'History', 'Greece', 'A.R', 'Burns', ""'Persia"", 'Greeks', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'renewed', 'acquaintance', 'Peter', 'Greene', ""'The"", 'Greco-Persian', 'Wars', 'Ernle', 'Bradford', ""'Thermopylae"", 'books', 'save', 'first', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'Amazon.com', 'A', 'public', 'domain', 'reprint', 'first', 'may', 'be', 'available', 'Amazon.com', 'title', ""'Stories"", 'Greece', 'Rome', 'Junior', 'Classics', 'Part', '3', ""'In"", 'brief', 'story', 'Leonidas', 'Xerxes', 'Ahasueras', 'Great', 'King', 'greatest', 'empire', 'world', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'prepared', 'greatest', 'invasion', 'force', 'ever', 'mustered', 'Greeks', 'sought', 'advice', 'Oracle', 'Delphi', 'Oracle', 'pronounced', 'wooden', 'walls', 'would', 'save', 'Athens', 'only', 'death', 'Spartan', 'king', 'would', 'save', 'unwalled', 'city', 'ruin.As', 'Persian', 'juggernaut', 'crossed', 'two', 'mile', 'long', 'pontoon', 'bridge', 'Europe', 'began', 'relentless', 'march', 'Greece', 'Greeks', 'temporized', 'argued', 'dithered', 'Finally', 'Sparta', 'sent', 'King', 'Leonidas', 'three', 'hundred', 'Spartiates', 'hold', 'pass', 'Thermopylae', 'Persian', 'hordes', 'Leonidas', 'stiffened', 'contingent', 'Helots', 'Spartan', 'serfs', 'volunteers', 'several', 'other', 'Greek', 'city-states', 'Phocis', 'Thebes', 'Thespia', 'few', 'others', 'swelled', 'Leonidas', 'ranks', 'few', 'thousand.Upon', 'being', 'told', 'when', 'Persians', 'loosed', 'arrows', 'sky', 'went', 'black', 'Spartiate', 'Dienekes', 'rejoined', 'quot', 'Then', 'shall', 'fight', 'shade.', 'quot', 'point', 'pass', 'no', 'more', '20', 'yards', 'wide', 'Leonidas', 'met', 'Persians', 'stopped', 'dead', 'tracks', 'three', 'days', 'men', 'held', 'mightiest', 'empire', 'mightiest', 'army', 'bay', 'slaughtering', 'flower', 'Persian', 'army', 'hundreds', 'not', 'thousands', 'might', 'have', 'held', 'traitorous', 'Greek', 'showed', 'Persians', 'mountain', 'pass', 'could', 'turn', 'Leonidas', 'position.Leonidas', 'had', 'guarded', 'pass', '1,000', 'Phocians', 'Persian', ""'Immortals"", 'Xerxes', 'best', 'unit', 'brushed', 'aside', 'learning', 'treachery', 'Leonidas', 'sent', 'other', 'city-states', 'contingents', 'home', 'prepared', 'last', 'stand', 'Thebans', 'Thespians', 'volunteered', 'stay', 'Leonidas', 'chose', 'battleground', 'wider', 'section', 'pass', 'wanted', 'wide', 'front', 'possible', 'could', 'kill', 'many', 'Persians', 'possible.The', 'Spartans', 'joined', 'battle', 'Persians', 'last', 'time', 'slaughter', 'was', 'horrific', 'When', 'anticipated', 'Immortals', 'took', 'rear', 'Spartans', 'retreated', 'hillock', 'formed', 'what', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'would', 'call', ""'Swiss"", 'Hedgehog', 'died', 'last', 'man.As', 'prophecy', 'foretold', 'Spartans', 'lost', 'king', 'saved', 'city', 'rest', 'Greece', 'invasion', 'continued', 'apace', 'Athens', 'was', 'sacked', 'entire', 'population', 'fleeing', 'island', 'Salamis', 'straits', 'Salamis', 'Athens', 'Greeks', 'lured', 'Persian', 'navy', 'doom', 'Later', 'plains', 'Plataea', 'Sparta', 'avenged', 'death', 'king', 'slaughtering', 'Persian', 'army', 'ending', 'once', 'Persian', 'threat', 'Spartans', 'plot', 'remarkably', 'well', 'failing', 'only', 'authenticity', 'detail', 'light', 'modern', 'depictions', 'pregunpowder', 'battle', 'movies', ""'Ran"", ""'Braveheart"", ""'Gladiator"", 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'laughable', 'must', 'remember', 'budgetary', 'special', 'effects', 'limitations', '60', 'era', 'B', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'got', 'more', 'right', 'did', 'wrong', 'dithering', 'Greeks', 'insanity', 'Leonidas', 'march', 'gritty', 'determination', 'martial', 'excellence', 'Spartiate', 'soldiers', 'hubris', 'Xerxes', 'death', 'archery', 'Spartiates', 'formed', 'Swiss', 'Hedghog', 'final', 'stand', 'most', 'heroic', 'person', 'Leonidas', 'king', 'who', 'willingly', 'laid', 'down', 'life', 'save', 'city-state', 'Greece', 'it.Richard', 'Egan', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'portrayal', 'villianous', 'gladiator', 'who', 'was', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'foe', ""'Demetrius"", 'Gladiators', 'better', 'villian', 'hero', 'there', 'was', 'still', 'something', 'very', 'engaging', 'portrayal', 'heroic', 'doomed', 'Spartan', 'King']",N/A
745221,A16FUU8WW76QFY,B00008MTW3,gork57,"[175, 179]","'The 300 Spartans' holds a special significance for me.  I first saw this film as a young boy (I'm now 46), and it sparked an interest in ancient history that remains with me to this day. It would be interesting if someone saw fit to remake the film, with modern visual effects enhancements-but I wonder if it would have the same impact as the original.Much of the movie is very close to the actual events, which took place in 480 B.C.  A huge Persian army, led by the Great King Xerxes, had crossed the Hellespont from Asia to conquer the impudent Hellenes.  The disparate, quarreling city-states of Greece had banded together to repel the invader, but could not agree on just what strategy to take.  It was decided that a force of Spartans and Allied Greeks would undertake a holding action at what was then a narrow pass between the mountains and the sea.  It was known as 'Thermopylae', or 'Hot Gates'.  The firmly religious Spartans were unable to send their full contingent of soldiers due to a holy festival (they were curiously tardy throughout their history in such situations).  However, Spartan King Leonidas' 300-strong personal bodyguard was not subject to this restriction, so he marched with them to the pass.  Along the way, he was joined by an estimated 7,000 or so Allied Greeks.  This tiny force went to confront a Persian host estimated by modern historians at around 100,000.The battle itself is the stuff of legend.  Superior weaponry, armor, and tactics (the famed Greek Hoplite phalanx), combined with the narrow pass that favored defense, enabled the Greeks to repel several frontal Persian assaults with tremendous loss.  It appeared that the Greeks would be able to hold Thermopylae for a considerable time-until a traitor showed the Persians a goat path through the adjoining mountains which they could use to turn the Greek position.  Once this was accomplished, the Greeks were doomed.  Leonidas sent most of the Allied contingent to safety, and made plans for his last stand.  He along with his entire bodyguard and about 1,700 allied Greek troops were slaughtered to the last man.  Even though the Battle of Thermopylae was a Greek defeat, it punctured the myth of Persian invincibility, and served as a powerful inspiration in the future defense of Greece.  A  simultaneous naval engagement at nearby Artemisium produced similar results: the  Persian fleet suffered serious loss due to storm damage and effective Greek action.Eventually, the Greek navy all but destroyed the Persian fleet near the island of Salamis (near Athens).  In 479, an Allied Greek army annihilated the last remnants of the vast Persian land host at Plataea (the greater proportion having crossed back to Asia with Xerxes after the loss of their supporting navy at Salamis), forcing the enemy from Europe for good.The film adheres pretty closely to this narrative-with some 'Hollywood'.  The love story is pure fiction (surprised?); there is some evidence that a Greek contingent may have attacked the Persian camp (possibly an attempt at killing Xerxes, thus circumventing the whole Persian expedition).  The Greek army was larger than portrayed in the film-but I'm sure this was due to budgetary constraints.  Mardonius, Hydarnes, and the Immortals-10,000 strong-really did exist (Mardonius commanded the Persian forces at the battle of Plataea, and was killed there).  Themistocles (played in the film by Ralph Richardson) was the driving force behind the creation of the Athenian navy-and commanded the Greek fleet in the crucial action at Salamis.  Unfortunately, the major role he played in the victory over Persia is largely absent in this film.The actual Sparta was a far cry from the liberal land portrayed in the film; weak or sickly Spartan children were thrown from a cliff at birth, or left to die from exposure.  Sparta was a harsh oligarchy, a military society where males were trained to be soldiers from birth.  The entire population of Messenia, a nearby city-state, was enslaved so the Spartans could devote their all to military training.  Sparta greatly feared a revolt of these 'helots', and many historians quote this as a main reason the whole of the Spartan army was reluctant to leave the homeland when their assistance was requested.In spite of these inaccuracies, this is indeed a great film to watch-and no one can dispute just what the stand of Leonidas and his 300 mean to democracy in the modern world.

745224,A276M3NSIY9B82,B00008MTW3,Harry Brewer,"[4, 5]","This version of the Spartan stand at Thermopalyae is historically more accurate than 300 which came out in 2007. 300 does have the better special effects, after all, it's 45 years later. The 300 Spartans was my first experience with this famous battle, as a child I thoroughly enjoyed it. Sadly, I'm now an adult, this film doesn't have the same impact on me. Richard Egan, a second tier star at best, as Leonidas is barely adequate. But I will be honest, the script is stiff, not giving the best lines for the actors to deliver. But as far as the story goes it's fairly accurate to the historical events of the battle.The basic story is that the Persians are invading Greece with one of the largest armies ever assembled up to that time. Xerxes (David Farrar) is bent on conquering the Greeks but the why isn't mentioned nor is his character given much room to develop, this is an action-adventure film. The Greeks decide in a Senate style meeting that a holding action must be done in order to give themselves enough time to muster their armies. It must be understood, at this time, Greece wasn't a unified country, they were a loose confederation of City-States headed by their own king & not always willing to cooperate with one another. Once all of this is decided, etc., King Leonidas of Sparta is approached & convinced he is the needed buffer between the Persians & Greeks. In essence, Thermopylae is The Greeks version of the Alamo; here they'll stand in order to preserve the Greek democracy. Unfortunately, the Spartans are in the midst of a religious festival & can't go to battle. Leonidas, in order to circumvent the festival, names 300 Spartans as his personal bodyguard.The selection of Thermopylae as a defensive position was a stroke of genius & luck. It is a very narrow stretch of beach with water on one side & high, unscalable cliffs on the other. This forces the Persians to attack in piecemeal, never able to throw their entire army into battle in mass. The Spartans were probably the first truly professional army in the world which gave them a great advantage on this narrow strip of land. The movie focuses on the 300 Spartans but they weren't the only Greeks there. They are others mentioned & shown in the movie but their presence doesn't have much to do with the film. This is the Spartans' heroic stand against a superior force, fighting to preserve democracy. What's barely mentioned is the navy the Greeks were assembling in order to cut off the Persians. The Greeks needed time to do this also, in fact, not long after the Battle of Thermopylae, there was a naval battle where the Greeks succeeded in defeating the Persian navy, thereby cutting them off from supplies & an escape route. Themistocles (Sir Ralph Richardson) is basically the brains behind it all & the leader of the Greek navy.The 300 Spartans is a so-so movie once you get past the dialog. It's also easier to take as a story than it's more famous 300.

745225,A1CZ7PH2JNRUCL,B00008MTW3,HG fan,"[8, 10]","This flick is a very good effort at telling the story of the 300 Spartans who died defending the pass at Thermopylae (as it has come down to us) against the Persians.I am always a bit amused at reviewers that 'measure' and slam ancient peoples, events and times using their modern 'yardsticks'! Most Greeks around that period both admired and feared the Spartans. Were the Spartans ruthless? Sure! But the Spartans were only MORE ruthless and militarily astute than other Greeks at the time and shouldn't be singled out for any particular 'knocking'. It was a different world; with different morals and values. It was a dog-eat-dog world of almost constant warfare between all the various Greek city-states. The Spartans simply evolved into the recognized top-dog. Since only free Spartans could serve in the army and the army is estimated to never have been more than 8-10,000 at the height of Sparta's power, diplomacy was always exhausted before going to war. When war was decided upon, up to half the army had to remain at home, to put down potential revolts by their slaves, the Helots, who had a habit of rebelling when the army was away. Sparta simply couldn't afford to lose many men in battle, and so, was actually reluctant to go to war. But when they did go to war... the other fella had better watch out!! In the movie King Leonidis receives word that the Spartan Council decided to fortify the Isthmus of Corinth instead of following him to Northern Greece (thus dooming the 300 Spartans). The decision is never explained in the movie, and the viewer is left with the impression that the council 'screwed' Leonidis and his troops. In reality, it was a very pregmatic move since the Isthmus is just a day or two forced march from home, allowing the army a quick response if the slaves revolted. It was Leonitis who ignored the council and took it upon himself to march north with his personal body guard. It is fortunate for 'western civilization' as we know it today that the Spartans (and around 7000 other Greeks) held Thermopylae and delayed Darius and the Persians long enough for the Greek cities to rally and eventually defeat them. It is a tribute to their bravery and sense of duty that the 300 Spartans (and 700 Thespians) died defending the pass to delay the Persians until the other Greeks were able to retreat from the trap.There is a Greek saying attributed to Spartan women who saw their husbands and sons off to war. Women gave the shield to their men and told them... ""With this, or on it!"" Since the shield was the heaviest part of any soldier's armour, if things went badly during a battle and they had to exit the field in a hurry, the shield was the first thing thrown away in flight. The saying meant for the men to come home with victory ('with this shield') or dead ('on it') as shields were commonly used as battlefield 'stretchers'. This 'hardcore' attitude was very real, since a woman's stature in Spartan society, and especially among other Spartan women, was linked directly to her husband's/son's performance and bravery in battle.To a Spartan, prowess in battle was everything... understandable in a martial society. All energies were directed toward supporting and securing the state, so agriculture and the arts were considered 'unmanly' occupations and had no real place in their culture. Note in the movie the statement about the Spartan mother that killed her own son when she saw he had a wound in his back.",4,Good telling of an historic event...,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,3457,"['flick', 'very', 'good', 'effort', 'telling', 'story', '300', 'Spartans', 'who', 'died', 'defending', 'pass', 'Thermopylae', 'come', 'down', 'Persians.I', 'am', 'always', 'bit', 'amused', 'reviewers', ""'measure"", 'slam', 'ancient', 'peoples', 'events', 'times', 'using', 'modern', ""'yardsticks"", 'Most', 'Greeks', 'period', 'admired', 'feared', 'Spartans', 'Were', 'Spartans', 'ruthless', 'Sure', 'Spartans', 'were', 'only', 'MORE', 'ruthless', 'militarily', 'astute', 'other', 'Greeks', 'time', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'particular', ""'knocking"", 'was', 'different', 'world', 'different', 'morals', 'values', 'was', 'dog-eat-dog', 'world', 'almost', 'constant', 'warfare', 'various', 'Greek', 'city-states', 'Spartans', 'simply', 'evolved', 'recognized', 'top-dog', 'only', 'free', 'Spartans', 'could', 'serve', 'army', 'army', 'estimated', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'more', '8-10,000', 'height', 'Sparta', 'power', 'diplomacy', 'was', 'always', 'exhausted', 'going', 'war', 'When', 'war', 'was', 'decided', 'upon', 'up', 'army', 'had', 'remain', 'home', 'put', 'down', 'potential', 'revolts', 'slaves', 'Helots', 'who', 'had', 'habit', 'rebelling', 'when', 'army', 'was', 'away', 'Sparta', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'lose', 'many', 'men', 'battle', 'so', 'was', 'actually', 'reluctant', 'go', 'war', 'when', 'did', 'go', 'war', 'other', 'fella', 'had', 'better', 'watch', 'out', 'movie', 'King', 'Leonidis', 'word', 'Spartan', 'Council', 'decided', 'fortify', 'Isthmus', 'Corinth', 'instead', 'following', 'Northern', 'Greece', 'thus', 'dooming', '300', 'Spartans', 'decision', 'never', 'explained', 'movie', 'viewer', 'left', 'impression', 'council', ""'screwed"", 'Leonidis', 'troops', 'reality', 'was', 'very', 'pregmatic', 'move', 'Isthmus', 'just', 'day', 'two', 'forced', 'march', 'home', 'allowing', 'army', 'quick', 'response', 'slaves', 'revolted', 'was', 'Leonitis', 'who', 'ignored', 'council', 'took', 'march', 'north', 'personal', 'body', 'guard', 'fortunate', ""'western"", 'civilization', 'know', 'today', 'Spartans', '7000', 'other', 'Greeks', 'held', 'Thermopylae', 'delayed', 'Darius', 'Persians', 'long', 'enough', 'Greek', 'cities', 'rally', 'eventually', 'defeat', 'tribute', 'bravery', 'sense', 'duty', '300', 'Spartans', '700', 'Thespians', 'died', 'defending', 'pass', 'delay', 'Persians', 'other', 'Greeks', 'were', 'able', 'retreat', 'Greek', 'saying', 'attributed', 'Spartan', 'women', 'who', 'saw', 'husbands', 'sons', 'war', 'Women', 'gave', 'shield', 'men', 'told', 'shield', 'was', 'heaviest', 'part', 'soldier', 'armour', 'things', 'went', 'badly', 'battle', 'had', 'exit', 'field', 'hurry', 'shield', 'was', 'first', 'thing', 'thrown', 'away', 'flight', 'saying', 'meant', 'men', 'come', 'home', 'victory', 'shield', 'dead', 'shields', 'were', 'commonly', 'used', 'battlefield', ""'stretchers"", ""'hardcore"", 'attitude', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'woman', 'stature', 'Spartan', 'society', 'especially', 'other', 'Spartan', 'women', 'was', 'linked', 'directly', ""husband's/son"", 'performance', 'bravery', 'battle.To', 'Spartan', 'prowess', 'battle', 'was', 'everything', 'understandable', 'martial', 'society', 'energies', 'were', 'directed', 'supporting', 'securing', 'state', 'agriculture', 'arts', 'were', 'considered', ""'unmanly"", 'occupations', 'had', 'real', 'place', 'culture', 'Note', 'movie', 'statement', 'Spartan', 'mother', 'killed', 'own', 'son', 'when', 'saw', 'had', 'wound', 'back']",N/A

The costumes were above par for the era in which it was made and the photography wasn't half bad. The Greek locations the film was shot in were nice to look at as well.However, the filmmakers should have fired their technical advisor. The Greek phalanx--a fixture of ancient warfare--was somehow overlooked. The troops line up shoulder to shoulder in thin, widely separated ranks like a skirmish line and, when the battle is joined, duke it out one-on-one, which just didn't happen in the ancient world (hard to have an Errol Flynn swordfight with a xiphos).The Spartans also give very stirring speeches that sound more like George Washington material than something Leonidas would have said. The democratic gloss given to these Spartans is a major faux pas--I actually laughed at it a couple times. The filmmakers apparently didn't know about the helots. Also, the Spartans in this film just don't act very... Spartan... what with the young man and his bonnie lass gamboling about the countryside and whatnot.I've spent a lot of time on the film's problems, but for what it's worth I was entertained.

Much like that three-hour opus Midway, there is a romantic subplot completely out of tone with the rest of the film. Diane Baker, who can really act mind you, seems to be channeling a beach party movie in her ill-advised love interest role.Luckily for the viewer it's all swords and sandals after the first half. For a sixties movie the battles are very well done indeed. The armies are large and the extras are plentiful. The battle is also creative in its use of fire and arrows. This isn't a two guys fighting to the death with fake swords Italian job. This is a battle of entire armies clashing on the screen.The location shooting in Greece proper is also a beautiful plus. The sets on the other hand are right out of the original Star Trek series almost to the point you expect Kirk and Spock to pop in any moment violating the prime directive. (This might explain why a Persian commander exclaims the Spartans fight like machines. Machines in ancient Greece? Must have escaped from the zoo.)There is also the hilariously historically inaccurate braying about freedom from the Spartan commander. (In reality Sparta was a model for Nazi Germany. And their views on slaves and slave labor would have made a Confederate general blush.) In actuality the Persians foes were the more enlightened of the two.But I am nit picking.

745234,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008MTW3,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[204, 214]","The narrow pass of Thermopalyae is long gone, with centuries of sendiment building a large plain.  The location of the statue of King Leonidas of Sparta set up along the highway does provide a sense of how narrow the geography was in 480 B.C. when a small force of Spartans and other Greek warriors held up the advance of King Xerxes and his Persian army (the parallels to the Alamo are palatable).  When I visited Greece last week I was glad we were able to stop at the monument for a few minutes, not so much because of what I had read in the history books about the Battle of Thermopalyae but because of the 1962 film ""The 300 Spartans.""Granted the acting in this film from director Rudolph Mat&eacute; is wooden, on a par with the Trojan Horse and the ships that turned out to the wooden walls of Athens that defeated Xerxes at Salamis.  But there is still something substantial to the battle sequences, as when Xerxes sends his Immortals against the Spartans and when the Spartans make a final valiant charge to kill the Persian monarch.  The basic political history of the times is covered in the film; Greece was debating whether or not to send soldiers that far north to stop the invaders and the Spartans decided not to send troops until a religious festival was over.  Consequently, King Leonidas (Richard Eagan) left with his personal bodyguard of 300 soldiers.  There is a trivial romantic subplot involving a young Spartan soldier and the girl he tried to leave behind, as well as an exiled Spartan King, Demaratus (Ivan Triesault) who tries to educate Xerxes (David Farrar) about the worth of these 300 soldiers.  In the end, the Spartans are betrayed by a Greek traitor who tells the Persians of a pass through the mountains where they can attack from the rear.  Leonidas learns of the treachery in time to evacuate the rest of the Greek army, but the Spartans will never retreat.This was one of the last films directed by Mat&eacute;, a respected cinematographer (""Pride of the Yankees,"" ""Lady From Shanghai"") who directed movies as different as ""D.O.A."" and ""When Worlds Collide.""  The battle sequences are the best part of ""The 300 Spartans,"" making excellent cinematic use of the contrast between the Spartans in their gold armor and red cloaks versus the black draped Persians with their wicker armor.  Eagan does not do much with the role of Leonidas, but he certainly gives the character the requisite sense of honor and nobility.  But perhaps the most memorable part of this film, which is one of the most cherished from my youth, is the marching music of the Spartans written by Manos Hadjidakis.  Clearly I am not alone in that regard.  ""The 300 Spartans"" is not a great film, but it has its moments and the tale is worth the telling.  Recently Frank Miller (""Batman: The Dark Night"") did his own graphic novel version of this story, which may well inspire Hollywood to remake this film.  It is certainly a tale worth telling again.",4,"Go Stranger and tell the Spartans: faithful, here we fell",1050019200,"04 11, 2003",2003,2957,"['narrow', 'pass', 'Thermopalyae', 'long', 'gone', 'centuries', 'sendiment', 'building', 'large', 'plain', 'location', 'statue', 'King', 'Leonidas', 'Sparta', 'set', 'up', 'highway', 'provide', 'sense', 'how', 'narrow', 'geography', 'was', '480', 'B.C', 'when', 'small', 'force', 'Spartans', 'other', 'Greek', 'warriors', 'held', 'up', 'advance', 'King', 'Xerxes', 'Persian', 'army', 'parallels', 'Alamo', 'are', 'palatable', 'When', 'visited', 'Greece', 'last', 'week', 'was', 'glad', 'were', 'able', 'stop', 'monument', 'few', 'minutes', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'had', 'read', 'history', 'books', 'Battle', 'Thermopalyae', '1962', 'film', '300', 'Spartans', 'Granted', 'acting', 'film', 'director', 'Rudolph', 'Mat', 'eacute', 'wooden', 'par', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'ships', 'turned', 'out', 'wooden', 'walls', 'Athens', 'defeated', 'Xerxes', 'Salamis', 'still', 'something', 'substantial', 'battle', 'sequences', 'when', 'Xerxes', 'Immortals', 'Spartans', 'when', 'Spartans', 'make', 'final', 'valiant', 'charge', 'kill', 'Persian', 'monarch', 'basic', 'political', 'history', 'times', 'covered', 'film', 'Greece', 'was', 'debating', 'not', 'send', 'soldiers', 'far', 'stop', 'invaders', 'Spartans', 'decided', 'not', 'send', 'troops', 'religious', 'festival', 'was', 'over', 'Consequently', 'King', 'Leonidas', 'Richard', 'Eagan', 'left', 'personal', 'bodyguard', '300', 'soldiers', 'trivial', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'involving', 'young', 'Spartan', 'soldier', 'girl', 'tried', 'leave', 'behind', 'as', 'well', 'exiled', 'Spartan', 'King', 'Demaratus', 'Ivan', 'Triesault', 'who', 'educate', 'Xerxes', 'David', 'Farrar', 'worth', '300', 'soldiers', 'end', 'Spartans', 'are', 'betrayed', 'Greek', 'traitor', 'who', 'Persians', 'pass', 'mountains', 'where', 'can', 'attack', 'rear', 'Leonidas', 'treachery', 'time', 'evacuate', 'rest', 'Greek', 'army', 'Spartans', 'will', 'never', 'retreat.This', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'films', 'directed', 'Mat', 'eacute', 'respected', 'cinematographer', 'Pride', 'Yankees', 'Lady', 'From', 'Shanghai', 'who', 'directed', 'movies', 'as', 'different', 'D.O.A', 'When', 'Worlds', 'Collide', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'best', 'part', '300', 'Spartans', 'making', 'excellent', 'cinematic', 'use', 'contrast', 'Spartans', 'gold', 'armor', 'red', 'cloaks', 'black', 'draped', 'Persians', 'wicker', 'armor', 'Eagan', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'role', 'Leonidas', 'certainly', 'character', 'requisite', 'sense', 'honor', 'nobility', 'perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'cherished', 'youth', 'marching', 'music', 'Spartans', 'written', 'Manos', 'Hadjidakis', 'Clearly', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'regard', '300', 'Spartans', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'moments', 'tale', 'telling', 'Recently', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Batman', 'Dark', 'Night', 'did', 'own', 'graphic', 'novel', 'version', 'story', 'may', 'well', 'inspire', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'film', 'certainly', 'tale', 'worth', 'telling', 'again']",N/A

Wow, that must be where the artist Christo got the idea for his Yellow Umbrella landscape displays.However, in usefulness lies in illuminating the incredible stand the Spartans made at Thermopylae and much of its' historical / political background.  Unlike some reviewers I don't demand full historical accuracy or political correctness from any film.  It is a bonus to get close to the truth when watching a historical film...which was also meant to entertain and make profits for the studio.  Film-makers are artists and all artists seek to portray reality in a creative form and reflect their own individuality.So... the history is close and the film portrays a fascinating episode from history with out the aid of CGI, over the top gore, and immorality (the dancing girls are tame enough and the temptation of the lovers is brief and basically chaste).  I was particularly pleased with the political interaction leading up to the Spartans departure for Thermopylae.  Themistocles role is succint and well-played.  The overall situation that led to the ""sacrifice"" of the 300 becomes clear.  They were UA Flight 93 passengers and were determined to do damage control so that their countrymen had a chance of avoiding enslavement by the Persians.  Themistocles reminded me of Winston Churchill leading into WWII.  He grasped the situation, fought for the truth to be made known, and was pro-active about a possible solution.  His naval battle at Salamis, which falls outside the scope of this film, put the nail in the coffin for the Persian King Xerxes' army of millions.In terms of educational value this film rates rather highly.  Not every detail is correct, but neither is any historical account one reads.  All accounts have a bias of some sort and the astute reader attempts to discover these before accepting all that is written.  Personally, I enjoy a good historical or semi-historical film...and then look up the subject on Wikipedia to find out where the story differs (I even remember when I looked things up in the encyclopedia set that sat on the shelf).Enjoy the film with viewers aged perhaps 12 and up and have fun with the details.  I thought King Xerxes robes looked like they came straight out of a high school play.  Don't be put off by not learning a great deal about the ""real"" Spartan culture or semi-realistic battles.

Years later and having read more I see the movie is what it is; a Hollywood production.  It's not entirely accurate but it does follow the narrative.A simple guideline of the story is thus; the the Great Persian King Xerxes invades the city states of Greece.  They decide to fight but can't decide how and of course time is needed to raise the army.  They decide on a defense action at the pass of Thermopylae.  They look to the Spartans but they won't move until a holy festival is finished.  The Spartan King Leonidas recognizes the danger and marches forth with his body guard of 300.  Along the way he picks up another 6-7000 Greeks and the tiny army faces a Persian army of 100000.The battle rages on and with better weapons and army.  Better tactics and a narrow pass made the Greek Hoplite Phalanx almost unbeatable.  The Greeks inflict numerous losses and look like they will win until a traitor shows the Persians another pass which allows them to send a force to attack the Greeks from both sides.  Leonidas decides to stand and he and the remaining Greeks(he sent away many of the allies) are annihilated.Even though the Battle is a loss; it serves to inspire the Greeks and it shattered the view of Persian invincibility.The acting of the film can be argued as somewhat wooden but it is  product of its time.There are some goofs in the film.  Look to the Javelins as the Spartans throw them at the Immortals.  They are blunt and you can see some guys dropping their weapons to catch them!The DVD says it has special features but they are nothing really interesting.

745241,A3RUSD36FWAGGD,B00008MTW3,Moon Mist,"[6, 11]","Way back in the 1960's, before the advent of VHS/DVD or cable, each of the three networks had their own ""Night At The Movies"" broadcast, with NBC being the first network to do so, I believe. These movies provided many truly great films with their network TV debuts. These airings were the first showings of these great movies that many Baby Boomers ever saw. I first saw the best Hitchcock films (REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, THE BIRDS, NORTH BY NORTHWEST) on NBC Saturday Night At The Movies, along with many of the golden age westerns of the 1950's.CBS and ABC soon followed suit, but I believe it was on NBC in the mid-1960's where I first saw THE 300 SPARTANS. My brother and I remembered it through the years as being a good movie, but having just rented it on DVD, I could only say that the movie overall was average at best. What drags the movie down most is the lack of action during the first 2/3 of the movie and the aforementioned soapy subplot, a la Kate & Leo in TITANIC, that was no doubt inserted to interest the younger audience and females in general. A good musical score can truly help an action movie, but this film and the little action that exists towards the end is accompanied by a less-than-stellar soundtrack.Although the cast contained Sir Ralph Richardson and Laurence Naismith, most of the acting is less inspired. I always enjoy Richard Egan, but I feel that he exudes more natural charisma than true acting skills as the Spartan King Leonidas. Barry Coe is especially bad as Diane Baker's love interest, but this was one of his very first roles and I believe he grew somewhat as an actor, as did Baker. Director Rudolph Mate was chiefly known for his skill as a cinematographer, and this is where the movie shines. It is a beautiful film to look at and was filmed very close to where the actual events occurred.The fact that the film was made in 1961 (released in 1962) is no excuse for the average results. Compare THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, SPARTACUS, BEN-HUR, KING OF KINGS, all made before this film. It is obvious that comparatively speaking, this project had a somewhat limited budget (the B-movie cast alone bears that out), which is truly sad, since it was made by a major studio, 20th-Century Fox, was filmed on location in Greece (a much bigger deal back then than it would be today, and a fact that likely used up most of the budget), and saddest of all, the true story was worthy of first-class cinematic treatment, which it certainly does not get here.The definitive version of the story of the Battle at Thermopylae may have yet to be made, but 300 is very entertaining and will certainly do until a more realistic and less fantastical version is made.  It would be unfair to compare that film and this one but not very unfair to compare other similar films made in the 1950's and 1960's and in doing that, THE 300 SPARTANS is average at best.",3,"Filmed during the golden age of historical epics, this movie should have been much better",1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,2876,"['Way', 'back', '1960', 'advent', 'VHS/DVD', 'cable', 'three', 'networks', 'had', 'own', 'Night', 'Movies', 'broadcast', 'NBC', 'being', 'first', 'network', 'do', 'so', 'believe', 'movies', 'provided', 'many', 'truly', 'great', 'films', 'network', 'TV', 'debuts', 'airings', 'were', 'first', 'showings', 'great', 'movies', 'many', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'ever', 'saw', 'first', 'saw', 'best', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'REAR', 'WINDOW', 'VERTIGO', 'THE', 'BIRDS', 'NORTH', 'BY', 'NORTHWEST', 'NBC', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Movies', 'many', 'golden', 'age', 'westerns', ""1950's.CBS"", 'ABC', 'soon', 'followed', 'suit', 'believe', 'was', 'NBC', 'mid-1960', 'where', 'first', 'saw', 'THE', '300', 'SPARTANS', 'brother', 'remembered', 'years', 'being', 'good', 'movie', 'having', 'just', 'rented', 'DVD', 'could', 'only', 'say', 'movie', 'overall', 'was', 'average', 'best', 'What', 'movie', 'down', 'most', 'lack', 'action', 'first', '2/3', 'movie', 'aforementioned', 'soapy', 'subplot', 'la', 'Kate', 'Leo', 'TITANIC', 'was', 'doubt', 'inserted', 'interest', 'younger', 'audience', 'females', 'general', 'good', 'musical', 'score', 'can', 'truly', 'help', 'action', 'movie', 'film', 'little', 'action', 'end', 'accompanied', 'less-than-stellar', 'soundtrack.Although', 'cast', 'contained', 'Sir', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Laurence', 'Naismith', 'most', 'acting', 'less', 'inspired', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Richard', 'Egan', 'feel', 'more', 'natural', 'charisma', 'true', 'acting', 'skills', 'Spartan', 'King', 'Leonidas', 'Barry', 'Coe', 'especially', 'bad', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'roles', 'believe', 'grew', 'somewhat', 'actor', 'did', 'Baker', 'Director', 'Rudolph', 'Mate', 'was', 'chiefly', 'known', 'skill', 'cinematographer', 'where', 'movie', 'shines', 'beautiful', 'film', 'look', 'was', 'filmed', 'very', 'close', 'where', 'actual', 'events', 'occurred.The', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1961', 'released', '1962', 'excuse', 'average', 'results', 'Compare', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'SPARTACUS', 'BEN-HUR', 'KING', 'OF', 'KINGS', 'made', 'film', 'obvious', 'comparatively', 'speaking', 'project', 'had', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'budget', 'B-movie', 'cast', 'alone', 'out', 'truly', 'sad', 'was', 'made', 'major', 'studio', '20th-Century', 'Fox', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Greece', 'much', 'bigger', 'deal', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'today', 'fact', 'likely', 'used', 'up', 'most', 'budget', 'saddest', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'worthy', 'first-class', 'cinematic', 'treatment', 'certainly', 'not', 'get', 'here.The', 'definitive', 'version', 'story', 'Battle', 'Thermopylae', 'may', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'made', '300', 'very', 'entertaining', 'will', 'certainly', 'do', 'more', 'realistic', 'less', 'fantastical', 'version', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'compare', 'film', 'one', 'not', 'very', 'unfair', 'compare', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'made', '1950', '1960', 'doing', '300', 'SPARTANS', 'average', 'best']",N/A
745242,A3ET9OE3TQ9OEJ,B00008MTW3,Nix Pix,"[1, 5]","&quot;The 300 Spartans&quot; is the story of an impossible, yet inspiring, stand by 300 Greek soldiers against the greatest army in the ancient world. Richard Egan, a buff, second string matinee idol, is King Leonidas of Sparta. His attempts to back the full scope of his military in defence of Thermopylae is hampered by political squabbling. Undaunted, Leonidas sets out to destroy Persian king, Xerxes - all the while realizing just how futile his journey is and how tragic his destiny shall be. The usual prerequisites of half naked women and massively overdone battle sequences - that all Hollywood epics circa the mid 50s to late 60s had - are reinstated for this film. Visually, it's stunning. Dramatically: below par and very long on spectacle over substance.TRANSFER: Fox gives us a very clean, very nice looking anamorphic transfer of this would be classic. Colors are rich, vibrant and bold. Contrast and black levels are dead on. There is some fading present during several night sequences. Film grain is noticeable but not distracting. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum. Digital anomalies (edge enhancement, pixelization) are present but do not distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely brings back the stereophonic appeal of classic Cinemascope movies. There's a sonic breadth to the musical score that does not extend to dialogue sequences.EXTRAS: Theatrical trailers and a few TV spots. Big deal!BOTTOM LINE: This is a movie for people who truly love and admire Hollywood epics. But it does not represent the height or even the best that the genre can offer.

745244,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B00008MTW3,Octavius,"[13, 14]","1961 film on the defiant stand at the pass of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. by Spartans against the Persian hordes of Xerxes. Although a 'B' movie not unlike the 1963 version of 'Jason and the Argonauts', the film makes decent attempts towards accuracy and reflecting the norms and values of each culture.The film follows the general historical facts pretty accurately. To avenge his father Darius' humiliating defeat at Marathon, King Xerxes of Persia prepares a major invasion of the Greek mainland with a gigantic army of over 100,000 men: the largest ever assembled up to that time in antiquity. Upon the Persians crossing the Hellespont into the Greek mainland, the Greek city states meet and discuss what to do next. King Leonidas of Sparta (Richard Egan) calls for an avant garde contingent to delay the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae (The Hot Gates), a narrow mountain pass so called because of the hot geysers nearby. A protracted battle there would delay the Persians and give the Greek cities time to mobilize and prepare their defenses. Debate ensues but Leonidas knows there's no time to waste. Ignoring a Spartan holiday's restrictions on fighting, Leonidas heads out with a group of his own bodyguard of 300 hoplites to the mountain pass: inspired by the Spartans' bravery, other Greek cities contribute a force of approximately 6000 men.At Thermopylae, the Greeks hold a narrow pass with a smaller force, giving them the most favorable position for a defense. The small plain leading to the pass had the topography of a trapezoid covering a very small area with mountains on two sides and cliffs to the sea on the other. The terrain offering limited maneuverability, the Greek hoplites defeat the poorly organized foreign army several times: the Persians being primarily adept at cavalry and archery were ill-prepared to fight in close quarters with heavy infantry formations such as the Greek phalanx. The Greeks armed with heavy armor, large metal shields, and long spears were much better equipped than the Persians who barely wore any armor and carried wicker shields. Victory almost seems plausible but the majority of the Greek army chooses to retreat and prepare better defenses; with their departure, only Leonidas and his 300 hoplites remain to hold the Persians back. After being betrayed and encircled, the remaining Spartans choose to stand their ground and fight to the bitter end.As shown in the film, the battle was a phyrric victory for the Persians that cost them many lives as well as the initiative. Although Xerxes would later exact revenge by plundering the Greek countryside and burning Athens, the Persian fleet's destruction by the Athenians at Salamis effectively cut off the main army from future supplies or reinforcements. In desperate straits, the Persian ground forces were finally crushed at Plaetea. The Persians would never again attempt an invasion of Greece; instead, the Greeks (with memories of Xerxes still in their collective psyche) eventually conquered Persia under Alexander The Great a century-and-a-half later. As for Thermopylae, the original stone plaque placed in memory of the brave Spartans who so valiantly stood their ground is still there today 2500 years later.The film does a good job at contrasting both the Greeks and Persians in terms of their cultures and military traditions such as social structure; political organization; as well as military discipline.  The story shows how the Greeks and even the Spartans were endowed with a sense of equality while the Persians were not. Greek aristocrats were more first-among- equals as opposed those in Persia who clearly distinguished themselves from those they ruled and were bound to do the King's bidding on a moment's notice.  The sense of equality was a product of the independent city-state that was governed by a constitutional government and written laws. Even Sparta's dual monarchy was a constitutional one. Persia on the other hand was the largest known empire: its boundaries spreading from Egypt to India. Its kings were very much like the pharaos of Egypt: absolute monarchs vested with divine powers to rule through a feudal system of noble vassals and their retainers. The Persian king was inviolate and would dispense with laws and his subjects on a whim: his word was law and to disobey or disappoint him could mean a cruel death by a method pleasing to his fancy.In terms of military organization, the film shows how Greeks treated war as a science instead of just a random display of power: there was high cohesion among the soldiers as they were free men collectively fighting for their homes.  In contrast, the Persian army was a mixed bag of vastly different cultures and fighting styles in which the king, not his generals, had supreme command even though he knew little about military strategy. Persian military organization and discipline was therefore lax with a very rigid top-to-bottom command structure: their camps were always accompanied by all sorts of fluff such as courtiers, entertainers, harems, relatives, and other useless baggage. The Greeks were, well, Spartan in comparison.  One error in the film is showing the Spartans throwing short spears.  Javelins and arrows were used by the Helot squires.  Spartan soldiers carried a 10-12 foot spear which they held over their shields to thrust and poke at the enemy: they didn't throw their spears as the phalanx would lose its effectiveness especially in a defensive engagement.As far as social structures, the film improperly compares the two when it states that the conflict represented a fight between free men and a society of slaves serving a despot. The film fails to note that all societies in antiquity practiced slavery and that slaves in Greece were probably no better off than those in Persia. Furthermore, freedom in Greece was limited. Sparta was a military state ruled by a dual monarchy in which male and female citizens were all trained to be soldiers: its economy was entirey dependent on a large slave society (helots) to support the citizenry. In democratic cities such as Athens and Corinth, political suffrage was given only to adult men who were vested with property and usually born free in the city itself (the liberal enfranchizement of foreigners through broad grants of citizenship was a uniquely Roman concept): women, children, slaves, and foreigners had limited to non-existant rights.Again, this is a 1960's 'B' movie. The script is weighed with Cold War propaganda. Although many of the main actors are seasoned theatrical actors, most of the method actors playing secondary roles are pretty stiff. Despite these faults, the plot moves at a rather steady pace and has good action. The cinematography is quite good and the combat scenes are well choreographed. A good film to rent or own. I heard that Michael Mann is planning to adapt and direct Stephen Pressfield's book 'Gates of Fire' for film; I look forward to seeing a modern version of this epic battle.",4,The Alamo of Ancient

745246,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00008MTW3,Only-A-Child,"[16, 17]","""300"" (2007), arguably a remake of ""The 300 Spartans"" (1962), should renew interest in this original version. Is a film that is based on a comic book series inspired by the 1962 movie, that covers the same events from the same point of view, and that uses almost the same title a remake? Technically it is, but then the same point could be made about almost every film centered around the ""Battle of Little Big Horn"".The 1962 film was hardly a Hollywood epic on the scale of ""Ben-Hur"" (1959) but it had a respectable budget, some large battle scenes, and a professional production design. I saw it in the theater and still have a copy (somewhere) of John Burke's mass-market paperback that was released concurrently with the film. The ""Three Stooges Meet Hercules"" only merited a comic book.""The 300 Spartans"" is a simplistic but generally accurate account of the events leading up to and the actual battle at a pass called Thermopylae (basically a narrow road with the mountains on one side and the sea on the other).King Xerxes had invaded Greece with a massive army but had to funnel his forces through the pass. Greece was made up of hundreds of independent city-states that were not used to cooperating with each other. The most militaristic of them being Sparta and the most nautical being Athens. King Leonidas of Sparta (Richard Egan) was able to reach the pass before Xerxes but he brought only his personal bodyguard of 300 Spartans. He was supported by a few thousand soldiers from other Greek cities and by the fleet from Athens (Athens gets no credit in the film which also fails to explain that almost half of Greece had allied with Xerxes). Eventually Xerxes is able to outflank the Spartans and their allies but much like the events at the Alamo, the holding action buys time to organize an effective resistance to the invasion. The film is quite stirring and inspirational in a one-sided propaganda sort of way.Diane Baker provides the romantic interest and also vaguely illustrates how the women of Sparta enjoyed an almost unprecedented power within their society (bet you didn't know that).Egan (best remembered as Elvis' older brother in ""Love Me Tender"") has an acting style much like that of William Shatner.

745248,A27M15DFUPV1CK,B00008MTW3,peterfromkanata,"[10, 11]","I had not seen &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot; since it was first released theatrically in 1962. I seem to recall it was also called &quot;The Lion of Sparta&quot;. Being a fan of these &quot;spear and sandal &quot; epics that were so popular at the time, I am very pleased to see titles like this being issued on DVD.At the same time, &quot;Spartans&quot; is not a great film, although it is certainly colourful and entertaining.Of course it tells the story of one of the most famous battles of the ancient world--Thermopylae--where King Leonidas of Sparta, and his personal guard of 300 men, held off--at least for a time--the countless hordes of Xerxes of Persia, who was determined to atone for his father, Darius' failure to conquer Greece 10 years earlier. Since they were entrenched in a narrow pass, Leonidas and his men were successful in frustrating Xerxes, until a traitor showed the Persians a secret path around the pass, whereby they could surround and destroy the valiant Spartans. This sacrifice bought the Greek army and navy precious time to unite and ultimately defeat Xerxes.This film lacks the grandeur ( and budget ? ) of some of the other historical spectacles of the time like Ben Hur and El Cid. It also does not have the cheesy, but enjoyable camp aspects of the Italian &quot;epics&quot; of the day, with Steve Reeves and all those Reeves &quot;wannabes&quot;. Richard Egan is Leonidas--while he is not Charlton Heston or Kirk Douglas, he does a credible job of expressing dignity and courage in the face of overwhelming odds. Sir Ralph Richardson is the wily Athenian politician, Themistocles--his voice alone commands your attention. Veteran British actor, David Farrar, chews up the scenery as Xerxes, bellowing orders, threatening fates-worse-than-death and--like any other despot in these types of films--ogling the dancing girls ! As his Commander-in-Chief, Donald Houston looks not at all comfortable in Persian warrior garb, taking constant flak from his increasingly impatient boss ! There is a weak romantic sub-plot that, frankly, gets in the way. The young lovers are played by Diane Baker and Barry Coe--Ms. Baker is fine--as for Mr. Coe, you can see why &quot;superstardom&quot; was not in his future !The battle scenes are well-staged, although younger viewers--used to the digital wizardry in current movies--may find them quaint.I see that another viewer has covered the technical aspects of the DVD better than I ever could--I will just say that I found the colourful, wide-screen picture to be excellent for a 40-year old film. Extras are sparse--a couple of trailers, TV promos, and trailers for three other Fox historical films.Is it a coincidence that this DVD is being released at the same time as that new spectacle about ancient Greece, &quot;Troy&quot; ? I doubt it--but this is good news. While I could not give it 5 stars, &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot; and similar movies of its vintage, deserve to be resurrected, cleaned up and made available on DVD. The price is also attractive. Parents--there is nothing in this film that is inappropriate for children, and if it kindles their interest in history, that really is an &quot;extra&quot; !",3,Spears and Sandals.,1084924800,"05 19, 2004",2004,3191,"['had', 'not', 'seen', 'quot', '300', 'Spartans', 'quot', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'theatrically', '1962', 'seem', 'recall', 'was', 'also', 'called', 'quot', 'Lion', 'Sparta', 'quot', 'Being', 'fan', 'quot', 'spear', 'sandal', 'quot', 'epics', 'were', 'so', 'popular', 'time', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'titles', 'being', 'issued', 'DVD.At', 'same', 'time', 'quot', 'Spartans', 'quot', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'certainly', 'colourful', 'entertaining.Of', 'course', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'battles', 'ancient', 'world', 'Thermopylae', 'where', 'King', 'Leonidas', 'Sparta', 'personal', 'guard', '300', 'men', 'held', 'off', 'least', 'time', 'countless', 'hordes', 'Xerxes', 'Persia', 'who', 'was', 'determined', 'atone', 'father', 'Darius', 'failure', 'conquer', 'Greece', '10', 'years', 'earlier', 'were', 'entrenched', 'narrow', 'pass', 'Leonidas', 'men', 'were', 'successful', 'frustrating', 'Xerxes', 'traitor', 'showed', 'Persians', 'secret', 'path', 'pass', 'whereby', 'could', 'surround', 'destroy', 'valiant', 'Spartans', 'sacrifice', 'bought', 'Greek', 'army', 'navy', 'precious', 'time', 'unite', 'ultimately', 'defeat', 'Xerxes.This', 'film', 'grandeur', 'budget', 'other', 'historical', 'spectacles', 'time', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'El', 'Cid', 'also', 'not', 'have', 'cheesy', 'enjoyable', 'camp', 'aspects', 'Italian', 'quot', 'quot', 'day', 'Steve', 'Reeves', 'Reeves', 'quot', 'quot', 'Richard', 'Egan', 'Leonidas', 'not', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'credible', 'job', 'expressing', 'dignity', 'courage', 'face', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'Sir', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'wily', 'Athenian', 'politician', 'Themistocles', 'voice', 'alone', 'attention', 'Veteran', 'British', 'actor', 'David', 'Farrar', 'up', 'scenery', 'Xerxes', 'bellowing', 'orders', 'threatening', 'fates-worse-than-death', 'other', 'despot', 'types', 'films', 'ogling', 'dancing', 'girls', 'Commander-in-Chief', 'Donald', 'Houston', 'not', 'comfortable', 'Persian', 'warrior', 'garb', 'taking', 'constant', 'flak', 'increasingly', 'impatient', 'boss', 'weak', 'romantic', 'sub-plot', 'frankly', 'way', 'young', 'lovers', 'are', 'played', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Barry', 'Coe', 'Ms.', 'Baker', 'fine', 'Mr.', 'Coe', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'future', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-staged', 'younger', 'viewers', 'used', 'digital', 'wizardry', 'current', 'movies', 'may', 'find', 'quaint.I', 'see', 'viewer', 'covered', 'technical', 'aspects', 'DVD', 'better', 'ever', 'could', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'found', 'colourful', 'wide-screen', 'picture', 'be', 'excellent', '40-year', 'old', 'film', 'Extras', 'are', 'sparse', 'couple', 'trailers', 'TV', 'promos', 'trailers', 'three', 'other', 'Fox', 'historical', 'films.Is', 'coincidence', 'DVD', 'being', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'new', 'spectacle', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'quot', 'Troy', 'quot', 'doubt', 'good', 'news', 'could', 'not', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'quot', '300', 'Spartans', 'quot', 'similar', 'movies', 'vintage', 'deserve', 'be', 'resurrected', 'cleaned', 'up', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', 'price', 'also', 'attractive', 'Parents', 'nothing', 'film', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'interest', 'history', 'really', 'quot', 'quot']",N/A

745261,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B00008MTW3,Simon Davis,"[7, 8]","The late 1950's and early 1960's where a boom time for both Hollywood and international film makers when historical epics based on the stories from ancient civilizations were all the vogue. The country of Greece with its rich and wonderful historical background provided many of the subjects for these films ranging from those based on the Greek myths and legends  as seen in ""Jason and the Argonauts"" through to ones that used actual historical incidents as the basis for their story as in this effort, the superbly put together, ""The 300 Spartans"". Often dismissed as simply another entry in the endless cycle of ""sword and sandal"" flicks common at this time, I believe that is an unfair judgement on this film which has so many worthy qualities about it in terms of both surprisingly high production values through to sterling individual performances. The defence of the pass of Thermopylae by 300 brave Spartan soldiers against the onslaught of the huge Persian army in 480 B.C. is one of the most unforgettable moments in ancient Greek history and in ""The 300 Spartans"", this incident which proved so important for the continued existence of Greece as a free state is treated with the respect and dignity that it richly deserves. While still managing to be a rousing spectacle this film always preserves the vital human element of this inspiring story and spends important time exploring what motivated these men to sacrifice their lives for their country and never simply sacrifices these story elements to become simply another typical ""sword and sandal"", action story. .........",4,Unfairly Neglected Epic Retelling Of A Memorable Moment In Greek History,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,1586,"['late', '1950', 'early', '1960', 'where', 'boom', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'international', 'film', 'makers', 'when', 'historical', 'epics', 'based', 'stories', 'ancient', 'civilizations', 'were', 'vogue', 'country', 'Greece', 'rich', 'wonderful', 'historical', 'background', 'provided', 'many', 'subjects', 'films', 'ranging', 'based', 'Greek', 'myths', 'as', 'seen', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'ones', 'used', 'actual', 'historical', 'incidents', 'basis', 'story', 'effort', 'superbly', 'put', 'together', '300', 'Spartans', 'Often', 'dismissed', 'simply', 'entry', 'endless', 'cycle', 'sword', 'sandal', 'flicks', 'common', 'time', 'believe', 'unfair', 'judgement', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'worthy', 'qualities', 'terms', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'sterling', 'individual', 'performances', 'defence', 'pass', 'Thermopylae', '300', 'brave', 'Spartan', 'soldiers', 'onslaught', 'huge', 'Persian', 'army', '480', 'B.C', 'one', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'moments', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'history', '300', 'Spartans', 'incident', 'proved', 'so', 'important', 'continued', 'existence', 'Greece', 'free', 'state', 'treated', 'respect', 'dignity', 'deserves', 'still', 'managing', 'be', 'rousing', 'spectacle', 'film', 'always', 'vital', 'human', 'element', 'inspiring', 'story', 'important', 'time', 'exploring', 'what', 'motivated', 'men', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'country', 'never', 'simply', 'story', 'elements', 'become', 'simply', 'typical', 'sword', 'sandal', 'action', 'story']",N/A
