668569,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,B00005NGAW,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[0, 0]","I thought I had an idea what to expect from this film.  Even putting aside the fact that Netflix has inappropriately listed this film as a Horror movie, I knew it would be cheap and schlocky and amateurish and puerile.  I was okay with that.  Nobody watches/rents/buys these films without the purpose of seeing beautiful women naked and frisky with each other.  No other production values matter in this regard.  Yet, this movie still disappoints.  I didn't care that the acting fell somewhere between poor and none.  I didn't mind that they seemed to be shooting this film without a script or any sort of rehearsing ahead of time... or any sort of preparation for that matter.What makes this movie most disappointing is that it would have only taken a few minor changes to make BIG improvements.  The biggest problem is the completely pointless and inveterately irritating presence of Lenny Juliano: a fat, dopey, whiney, douchebag who brings absolutely nothing worthwhile or useful to this film.  He isn't at all funny, and this worthless sack of lint threatens to interfere with the only merit this film has otherwise, which is gratuitous nudity and physical interaction between the female principles.  Get rid of him, and the difference is significant.  The biggest source of humor in this film was the highly improbable premise that the women were in a sorority, or that they were even college-aged for that matter.But even the amorous interaction between the ""actresses"" really came off more as a multi-dancer routine from a strip club (a lot of tease-touching and uninspired slow-grinding).  Given that these are women who have done some fairly unambiguous/explicit work in other films does give one pause to wonder why this one was so tame and lethargic, especially since the film had nothing else going for it.  Forget the dialogue and acting and plot (assuming there was any to begin with).  Just concentrate on the one and only reason anyone would want to watch this film.Unfortunately, this film just wasn't very good, even by the remarkably meager standards it was measured by.  So why 2 stars instead of just one?
