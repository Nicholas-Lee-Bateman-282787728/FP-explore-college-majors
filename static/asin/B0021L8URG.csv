1247047,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0021L8URG,Mark Baker,"[4, 9]","The story is told to us by Toby ""Toe"" Thompson (Jimmy Bennett).  He lives in Black Falls, a special subdivision built around the plant that creates the Black Box.  All the adults work in the factory.  These devices not only serve as cell phone, computer, and PDA, but they also toast your bread, groom your dog, and do anything else you could want them to do.One day while being attacked by bullies, Toe finds a special rainbow colored rock.  Following the instructions he hears, he makes a wish for friends, only to find small aliens following him around.  But things get out of hand at school the next day, and the rock begins a journey around the neighborhood.  As various people unknowingly make wishes while holding the rock, crazy things start to happen.  Will life for the citizens of Black Falls ever be the same?I will confess, I saw this movie because the previews I saw for it made it look like a mindless funny family film.If only I had know.Before I get to trashing the film, let's discuss what I did like.  Some of the situations were funny, and one running gag involving a brother, sister, and a staring contest was great.The problems with the movie?  Where do I even begin?Unlike the movie, let's start at the beginning.  The movie is told is a series of smaller stories.  You could call them chapters, really.  These short sections are how the movie got its name.  But we aren't told the story in chronological order.  I'm not exactly sure why since all this convention did was distract me from what was on the screen.Now I knew from the previews that this movie would feature some pretty far fetched fantasy that was going to be played for laughs.  That's how the movie started, but as it went, it lost the comedy and left me bored counting down until the climax.And don't even get me started on the giant booger monster.Or the ending.  This has to be one of the lamest climaxes I have seen in a long, long time.  To say more would be to spoil much, which I am not going to do.  Let's just say the ending would make the ancient Greeks and their deus ex machina proud.  Plus, they crammed the moral down our throats instead of letting it be part of the story.This movie is rather special effect heavy, and they were a mixed bag as well.  Some looked absolutely great; some looked completely fake.The characters were little more than one dimensional cut outs, so it was hard to care about the outcome.  The acting didn't help.  It was routinely over the top, a choice I think that was made on purpose.  For the kids it worked, but it left the adults looking stupid and the audience annoyed.What looked like a fun premise for a movie turned into a colossal waste of time and money.  Trust me.  You'll be sorry if you waste even a short amount of time on this one.",1,"""I Wish I Was a Big...Dung Beetle.""",1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,2778,"['story', 'told', 'Toby', 'Toe', 'Thompson', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'Black', 'Falls', 'special', 'subdivision', 'built', 'plant', 'Black', 'Box', 'adults', 'work', 'factory', 'devices', 'not', 'only', 'serve', 'cell', 'phone', 'computer', 'PDA', 'also', 'toast', 'bread', 'groom', 'dog', 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'want', 'do.One', 'day', 'being', 'attacked', 'bullies', 'Toe', 'special', 'rainbow', 'colored', 'rock', 'Following', 'instructions', 'wish', 'friends', 'only', 'find', 'small', 'aliens', 'following', 'around', 'things', 'get', 'hand', 'school', 'next', 'day', 'rock', 'journey', 'neighborhood', 'various', 'people', 'unknowingly', 'make', 'wishes', 'holding', 'rock', 'crazy', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'Will', 'life', 'citizens', 'Black', 'Falls', 'ever', 'be', 'same', 'will', 'confess', 'saw', 'movie', 'previews', 'saw', 'made', 'look', 'mindless', 'funny', 'family', 'only', 'had', 'know.Before', 'get', 'trashing', 'film', 'let', 'discuss', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'situations', 'were', 'funny', 'one', 'running', 'gag', 'involving', 'brother', 'sister', 'staring', 'contest', 'was', 'great.The', 'problems', 'movie', 'Where', 'do', 'even', 'begin', 'movie', 'let', 'start', 'beginning', 'movie', 'told', 'series', 'smaller', 'stories', 'could', 'call', 'chapters', 'really', 'short', 'sections', 'are', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'name', 'are', ""n't"", 'told', 'story', 'chronological', 'order', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'why', 'convention', 'did', 'was', 'distract', 'what', 'was', 'screen.Now', 'knew', 'previews', 'movie', 'would', 'feature', 'pretty', 'far', 'fetched', 'fantasy', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'played', 'laughs', 'how', 'movie', 'started', 'went', 'lost', 'comedy', 'left', 'bored', 'counting', 'down', 'climax.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'giant', 'booger', 'monster.Or', 'ending', 'be', 'one', 'lamest', 'climaxes', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'spoil', 'much', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'do', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'ending', 'would', 'make', 'ancient', 'Greeks', 'deus', 'machina', 'proud', 'crammed', 'moral', 'down', 'throats', 'instead', 'letting', 'be', 'part', 'story.This', 'movie', 'rather', 'special', 'effect', 'heavy', 'were', 'mixed', 'bag', 'as', 'well', 'looked', 'absolutely', 'great', 'looked', 'completely', 'fake.The', 'characters', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'one', 'dimensional', 'cut', 'outs', 'was', 'hard', 'care', 'outcome', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'routinely', 'top', 'choice', 'think', 'was', 'made', 'purpose', 'kids', 'worked', 'left', 'adults', 'looking', 'stupid', 'audience', 'annoyed.What', 'looked', 'fun', 'premise', 'movie', 'turned', 'colossal', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'Trust', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorry', 'waste', 'even', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'one']",N/A

1247053,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B0021L8URG,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[4, 7]","Robert Rodriguez' Shorts is childish, unrealistic and immature - in a good way. It's by no means a masterpiece, but once again the director has proven he has a way with children's films. The plot is jumbled up and out of order like a Tarantino movie and doesn't demonstrate a particularly unique idea; what it does masterfully accomplish, however, is creative entertainment. The look and feel of Shorts is wildly inventive, fantastical, definitely kid-worthy, and quite simply a whole lot of fun.To tell the tale of the crazily kooky adventure granted to the usually uneventful town of Black Falls, narrator and star Toby ""Toe"" Thompson (Jimmy Bennett) skips ahead, rewinds backwards onscreen and dodges through the timeline of events. He decides to tell the story completely out of order in a series of shorts. While messing with chronology is typically a nuisance, it works well for Rodriguez, keeping things continually interesting and building upon minor characters, while effectively holding the attention of kids.Black Box Incorporated is the center of interest for the entire town. It's run by the ruthless Mr. Black (James Spader), who is only concerned with upgrading his all-in-one black box multi-tool invention to outdo his many competitors. The box works like a Transformer, reconstructing itself automatically into a cell phone, vacuum, toaster, grenade, dog trimmer, baby monitor and much, much more. His team leaders (Leslie Mann and Jon Cryer) are the parents of Toby, and his daughter Helvetica (Jolie Vanier) - or ""Hel"" for short - makes Toby's life miserable, bullying him incessantly at school. When neighbor Loogie (Trevor Gagnon) discovers a magical rock that grants wishes, Toby's real troubles are about to begin.Although a movie about wishes run amok isn't entirely new, the family-friendly, clean setting and bright tone of the film contributes to solid entertainment. While it serves as a fantastical, quixotic tutoring on wishing for something worthwhile and being careful what you wish for, the execution and planning of the muddled events is truly worthwhile. Little green aliens can't fix Toby's ""lack of friends"" problem, prevent an army of crocodiles from eating Loogie's homework, protect the Short brothers from pterodactyl abduction, or save Nose Noseworthy from the Big Bad Booger. Boiling down to the basic carefree fantasies of kids, the welcome notion of getting anything you can imagine, and the realization that understanding and friendship can resolve more than wishing yourself out of a predicament, Shorts playfully amuses with a vastly creative eye for merriment and nonsense. This is a film that proves pure fantasy can be pleasant and adults don't have to be bored to death with the material their children drag them to.- Mike Massie",3,Shorts Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,2782,"['Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'Shorts', 'childish', 'unrealistic', 'immature', 'good', 'way', 'masterpiece', 'once', 'again', 'director', 'proven', 'way', 'children', 'films', 'plot', 'jumbled', 'up', 'order', 'Tarantino', 'movie', ""n't"", 'demonstrate', 'particularly', 'unique', 'idea', 'what', 'masterfully', 'accomplish', 'however', 'creative', 'entertainment', 'look', 'feel', 'Shorts', 'wildly', 'inventive', 'fantastical', 'definitely', 'kid-worthy', 'quite', 'simply', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun.To', 'tell', 'tale', 'crazily', 'kooky', 'adventure', 'granted', 'usually', 'uneventful', 'town', 'Black', 'Falls', 'narrator', 'star', 'Toby', 'Toe', 'Thompson', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'ahead', 'backwards', 'onscreen', 'timeline', 'events', 'tell', 'story', 'completely', 'order', 'series', 'shorts', 'messing', 'chronology', 'typically', 'nuisance', 'well', 'Rodriguez', 'keeping', 'things', 'continually', 'interesting', 'building', 'minor', 'characters', 'effectively', 'holding', 'attention', 'kids.Black', 'Box', 'Incorporated', 'center', 'interest', 'entire', 'town', 'run', 'ruthless', 'Mr.', 'Black', 'James', 'Spader', 'who', 'only', 'concerned', 'upgrading', 'all-in-one', 'black', 'box', 'multi-tool', 'invention', 'outdo', 'many', 'competitors', 'box', 'Transformer', 'reconstructing', 'automatically', 'cell', 'phone', 'vacuum', 'toaster', 'grenade', 'dog', 'trimmer', 'baby', 'monitor', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'team', 'leaders', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'are', 'parents', 'Toby', 'daughter', 'Helvetica', 'Jolie', 'Vanier', 'Hel', 'short', 'Toby', 'life', 'miserable', 'bullying', 'incessantly', 'school', 'When', 'neighbor', 'Loogie', 'Trevor', 'Gagnon', 'magical', 'rock', 'wishes', 'Toby', 'real', 'troubles', 'are', 'begin.Although', 'movie', 'wishes', 'run', 'amok', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'new', 'family-friendly', 'clean', 'setting', 'bright', 'tone', 'film', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'fantastical', 'quixotic', 'tutoring', 'wishing', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'being', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'execution', 'planning', 'muddled', 'events', 'truly', 'worthwhile', 'Little', 'green', 'aliens', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fix', 'Toby', 'lack', 'friends', 'problem', 'prevent', 'army', 'crocodiles', 'eating', 'Loogie', 'homework', 'protect', 'Short', 'brothers', 'pterodactyl', 'abduction', 'save', 'Nose', 'Noseworthy', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Booger', 'Boiling', 'down', 'basic', 'carefree', 'fantasies', 'kids', 'welcome', 'notion', 'getting', 'anything', 'can', 'imagine', 'realization', 'understanding', 'friendship', 'can', 'resolve', 'more', 'wishing', 'predicament', 'Shorts', 'playfully', 'vastly', 'creative', 'eye', 'merriment', 'nonsense', 'film', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'can', 'be', 'pleasant', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'bored', 'death', 'material', 'children', 'drag', 'to.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A
