753564,A1ADGDZFUKW0TJ,B00009AV9T,Andrew P. Kluka,"[1, 1]","I have watched this entire series, and its' sister series ""The CBS News War in the Pacific, with Walter Cronkite"" many times. The much more acclaimed ""The World at War"" from the BBC gets more acclaim and attention, but this series is just as good, if not better. The twist is, .... both series stress their country's role in the war, and leave out much of what the other country did.As far as a prelude to war and the explaining of the causes of the War ... the CBS series wins .. .hands down. The World at War series gets into Germany's rise from the ashes after WW 1, into Hitler's ascent into power, and then into The German invasion of Poland in the first episode. The CBS series has a tremendously impressive story built into it about Japan's role in the prelude to war by it's invasion of Manchuria, and then mainland China, before Germany even comes into the picture. It's amazing to see the Chinese as tremendously grateful for the American role in their battle against the Japanese in the 1930's.The rise of Hitler from a nut-case anarchist into Chancellor, and then ultimately dictator of Germany is well chronicled. It's fascinating to see the development of Hitler from a crack-pot soap box orator into what many Germans almost perceived to be a ""god"".Many of Hitler's henchmen are subjects of their own episode (Goerring, Goebbels, Hess), unfortunately not Himmler). Those Germans who repeatedly tried to kill Hitler are also profiled (Count Claus von Staufenburg, etc.) There is great coverage as well as the horrific ""trial"" of these ""conspirators"". I had never seen some of the footage of these trials, the defendants and the absolutely whacko judge who, ironically and justly enough, was killed in own courtroom trying some of the last of these ""traitors"" from the failed July 20, 1944 assassination attempt on the Fuhrer in March of 1945.His courtroom was hit and he was killed, by a a bomb perhaps guided there by God Himself. Who knows? But the judge was clearly over-the top nuts and deserved ""justice"".  The video has some fascinating lectures by him depicted as he berates those he branded ""traitors"", who were acting , in the main, in their firm belief that they were trying to save Germany from a madman (Hitler).As for most military action, there is definitely an American emphasis, just as ""The World at War"", clearly emphasized the British military.All in all, put both together...and a GREAT learning experience is in store for you. If I had to chose just one, I would go with this one, but ""the World at War"" is also just too good to pass up. You should check them both out. I'm sure you will be immensely informed, entertained and enlightened.",5,First Class DVD series on World War 2,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,2674,"['have', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'sister', 'series', 'CBS', 'News', 'War', 'Pacific', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'many', 'times', 'much', 'more', 'acclaimed', 'World', 'War', 'BBC', 'more', 'acclaim', 'attention', 'series', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'twist', 'series', 'stress', 'country', 'role', 'war', 'leave', 'out', 'much', 'what', 'other', 'country', 'far', 'prelude', 'war', 'explaining', 'causes', 'War', 'CBS', 'series', '..', '.hands', 'down', 'World', 'War', 'series', 'Germany', 'rise', 'ashes', 'WW', '1', 'Hitler', 'ascent', 'power', 'then', 'German', 'invasion', 'Poland', 'first', 'episode', 'CBS', 'series', 'tremendously', 'impressive', 'story', 'built', 'Japan', 'role', 'prelude', 'war', 'invasion', 'Manchuria', 'then', 'mainland', 'China', 'Germany', 'even', 'picture', 'amazing', 'see', 'Chinese', 'tremendously', 'grateful', 'American', 'role', 'battle', 'Japanese', ""1930's.The"", 'rise', 'Hitler', 'nut-case', 'anarchist', 'Chancellor', 'then', 'ultimately', 'dictator', 'Germany', 'well', 'chronicled', 'fascinating', 'see', 'development', 'Hitler', 'crack-pot', 'soap', 'box', 'orator', 'what', 'many', 'Germans', 'almost', 'perceived', 'be', 'god', '.Many', 'Hitler', 'henchmen', 'are', 'subjects', 'own', 'episode', 'Goerring', 'Goebbels', 'Hess', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'Himmler', 'Germans', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'tried', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'are', 'also', 'profiled', 'Count', 'Claus', 'von', 'Staufenburg', 'etc', 'great', 'coverage', 'as', 'well', 'horrific', 'trial', 'conspirators', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'footage', 'trials', 'defendants', 'absolutely', 'whacko', 'judge', 'who', 'ironically', 'justly', 'enough', 'was', 'killed', 'own', 'courtroom', 'trying', 'last', 'traitors', 'failed', 'July', '20', '1944', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'Fuhrer', 'March', '1945.His', 'courtroom', 'was', 'hit', 'was', 'killed', 'bomb', 'perhaps', 'guided', 'God', 'Himself', 'Who', 'judge', 'was', 'clearly', 'over-the', 'top', 'nuts', 'deserved', 'justice', 'video', 'fascinating', 'lectures', 'depicted', 'branded', 'traitors', 'who', 'were', 'acting', 'main', 'firm', 'belief', 'were', 'trying', 'save', 'Germany', 'madman', 'Hitler', '.As', 'most', 'military', 'action', 'definitely', 'American', 'emphasis', 'just', 'World', 'War', 'clearly', 'emphasized', 'British', 'military.All', 'put', 'together', 'GREAT', 'learning', 'experience', 'store', 'had', 'chose', 'just', 'one', 'would', 'go', 'one', 'World', 'War', 'also', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'pass', 'up', 'should', 'check', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'immensely', 'informed', 'entertained', 'enlightened']",World War II With Walter Cronkite: War in Europe

It was a different time, when mostly the young were drafted into service to fight against an evil that, at that time, threatened  the world.  It literally changed that world.  The series is a good 'jumping off place' not only for any one who wants to go on to study the War in greater depth but also an excellent source for family study and perhaps remembrance.
