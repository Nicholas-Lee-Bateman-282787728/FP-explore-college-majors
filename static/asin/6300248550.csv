Timothy Dalton is the perfect Rochester--he literally channels the character. Sure he gorgeous and in the book Rochester is not as handsome, but he is all Rochester in every other way. Zelah Clarke makes a great Jane.I have seen several other versions of ""Jane Eyre"", and most have something special to offer. The George C. Scott portrayal of Rochester was spot on, but Susanna York was way too beautiful and mature to play the young Jane.(Jane was not played by George's real life wife, Trish Van Devere, as one of the reviewers mentioned.) And it was much too short and edited down. The main music theme was haunting and beautiful. (Would like to find the soundtrack of it, if it exists.) The William Hurt version was forgettable. Both leads were miscast. The Ciaran Hinds film was ok, but I still didn't really get him as Edward. I can't even remember the actress who played Jane. And I vaguely remember an Orson Welles version. As I recall, he seemed to be a fairly good Rochester, but that movie version was not otherwise memorable.So, what I am saying here is that if you want to really know the Jane Eyre story, this is the one to get.

228546,AKQFIKZNANJV3,6300248550,Andrea K. Johnson,"[10, 10]","I'd never have believed that anyone could make the long, flowery, ornate, 19th century language in Charlotte Bronte's novel sound natural in a modern-day production -- ""my pet lamb"" -- and ""Jane, you strange, almost unearthly thing,"" etc. etc. or that I would find a James Bond actor believable as Rochester. Wrong on both counts. Timothy Dalton's performance here is really a tour de force. He's mercurial, explosive, intense, brooding, cunning, manipulative, self-pitying, insightful, mischievous, sexual, tender, loving, gentle, sometimes all at the same time or at least in the same five minute scene. He's the original ""mad, bad, and dangerous to know,"" to use Caroline Lamb's words about her lover Byron. That is, of course, like catnip. You watch him on the screen and know he's very bad news and you also know you wouldn't be able to resist. I'm not quite sure how Zelah Clarke's Jane is able to resist. Too handsome and too young, yes, but the portrayal more than makes you forget that.Clarke is an interesting Jane. There's a scene the morning after she accepts Mr. Rochester's proposal where she literally runs into his arms, absolutely beaming, that made me physically gasp. This is a Jane whose primary trait is her desire to be loved. She's not really meant to be mouselike or long-suffering or patiently enduring, though she's learned to put on a facade. When Rochester loves her, she loves him back innocently and wholeheartedly, which makes the scene after the big reveal about Rochester's mad wife in the attic all the more heartbreaking. Clarke's Jane resembles someone who's been kicked in the stomach, hurt too badly to cry or react or shout at Rochester like he's begging her to. Clarke plays all those subtleties expertly.Like other reviewers, I did think she looked older than 18 or 19, but so do all of the other actresses who've played the part. On the other hand, I think Jane is supposed to be one of those ageless looking characters. She likely looked older when she was young and would have looked younger when she was old. Her life experiences would have provided her with a sense of self-possession that would have given her more maturity than a young debutante of the era. Clarke is physically very small, particularly next to Dalton, which is right for the character, but a bit more rounded out than the Jane of the book.Comparing the recent screen versions of Jane Eyre, I've found something I like in most of them. The 1940s version with Orson Wells had the best young Adele in Margaret O'Brien. She's an adorable, enchanting little girl in that movie, as young as she should be according to the book. This movie also gets the Gothic air right, in part because it's black and white. On the other hand, Jane is too blonde and too composed, while Orsn Wells is too bombastic. The 1970s BBC version also uses all of the dialogue from the book, but I thought it was a bit more mannered than this 1983 version. The 1996 A&E; version with Samantha Morton is shorter, very condensed, the language updated and the story cut to focus on Rochester and Jane. I preferred the ending scene in the A&E; version when Jane returns to Rochester, over the 1983 version, which although true to the novel, seems to somehow diminish Rochester a bit, if not Jane. Morton's version of Jane doesn't drag out why she came back. She leaves Rochester in no doubt that he's still a man and she'd take him any way she could get him. I also thought the 2006 BBC version did a better job with those ending scenes than the 1983 version did, though some people object to its physicality. To paraphrase, as the 2006 version of Rochester says, ""I don't want a nurse. I want a wife. You and I aren't platonic people, Jane."" The 1990s big screen version with William Hurt is mopey and melancholy and makes you long to put Rochester and Jane out of their misery. If you're a Jane Eyre aficionado, you'll probably want all of the above and, as I do, mix and match the various actors from each movie until you have your perfect daydream cast. I think Timothy Dalton's Rochester is the current headliner. This is a very good version that is well worth the trouble of buying.

228547,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,6300248550,Andrew Raker,"[0, 0]","1.Jane Eyre (1983) Individual rating: 5 starsThis BBC version of Jane Eyre starring Timothy Dalton is the best version I have seen. Compared with the Miramax 1996 version, 1997 A&E; version, or 2006 Masterpiece adaptation, this 1983 adaptation is considerably better. [However, Jayston's characterization of Rochester in the 1973 adaptation is more accurate to Charlotte Bronte's intent.]What I liked about the BBC 1983 version is that I can picture the characters in their respective roles. For example, Timothy Dalton is everything I imagined Edward Fairfax Rochester as being - smart, sarcastic, cynical, etc (even if he is too handsome). In addition, Zelah Clarke plays Jane Eyre very well. She brings a serious tone to Jane's character. Some television editions of Jane Eyre 'tick me off' by having an older teenager girl (who has no maturity) play this important role. The acting does not convince me and ruins the film.Finally, this film appeals to me because it takes much of the dialogue straight from the book. Certainly, there are a few minor scenes from the book that are left out or slightly compressed. However, for the most part, this film is perfectly loyal to the novel. In fact, I probably shouldn't say, but this film is so accurate that you could probably pass a reading comprehension test on the novel ""Jane Eyre"" simply by watching this film one or two times and taking notes.I also recommend the 1973 BBC ""Jane Eyre"" adaptation. (In fact, I think the 1973 adaptation has the better characterization, although a slightly less-faithful plot in areas that do not much matter such as when Jane is roaming the countrside after fleeing Thornfield Hall.)2.Middlemarch  Individual rating: 3.5 starsHaving watched ""Bleak House"" (2005) and ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1996) both scripted by Andrew Davies, I was hoping this adaptation of ""Middlemarch"" would be excellent. I was slightly disappointed. I do not think the film is truly aweful, but I do believe it could have been more interesting. ""Middlemarch"" is a long and complicated novel, and I feel Davies could have done a better job with the script.I only viewed ""Middlemarch"" once a few years ago. (I purchased it as part of the George Eliot BBC collection.) Therefore, I do not remember everything I felt could have been improved. I think the biggest problem I had was Davies perspective since it creates the reality for the viewer. I felt his perspective was not quite emotional enough, even considering how melancholic certain parts of the Eliot's length novel are.Furthermore, at 375 minutes, I do not believe justice was done to the entire cast of characters. Some characters really lacked sufficient development.Personally, unless you are an Eliot afficiando, I would just wait until the BBC creates another ""Middlemarch"" adaptation. Hopefully, the adaptation will be more like ""Bleak House"" (2005) at least in terms of character development.",4,Jane Eyre > Middlemarch,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,2914,"['1.Jane', 'Eyre', '1983', 'Individual', 'rating', '5', 'starsThis', 'BBC', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'starring', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'best', 'version', 'have', 'seen', 'Compared', 'Miramax', '1996', 'version', '1997', 'A', 'E', 'version', '2006', 'Masterpiece', 'adaptation', '1983', 'adaptation', 'considerably', 'better', '[', 'However', 'Jayston', 'characterization', 'Rochester', '1973', 'adaptation', 'more', 'accurate', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'intent', ']', 'What', 'liked', 'BBC', '1983', 'version', 'can', 'picture', 'characters', 'respective', 'roles', 'example', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'everything', 'imagined', 'Edward', 'Fairfax', 'Rochester', 'being', 'smart', 'sarcastic', 'cynical', 'etc', 'even', 'too', 'handsome', 'addition', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'very', 'well', 'serious', 'tone', 'Jane', 'character', 'television', 'editions', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'having', 'older', 'teenager', 'girl', 'who', 'maturity', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'acting', 'not', 'convince', 'film.Finally', 'film', 'appeals', 'much', 'dialogue', 'straight', 'book', 'Certainly', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'scenes', 'book', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'slightly', 'compressed', 'However', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'perfectly', 'loyal', 'novel', 'fact', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'so', 'accurate', 'could', 'probably', 'pass', 'reading', 'comprehension', 'test', 'novel', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'simply', 'watching', 'film', 'one', 'two', 'times', 'taking', 'notes.I', 'also', 'recommend', '1973', 'BBC', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'adaptation', 'fact', 'think', '1973', 'adaptation', 'better', 'characterization', 'slightly', 'less-faithful', 'plot', 'areas', 'do', 'not', 'much', 'matter', 'such', 'when', 'Jane', 'roaming', 'countrside', 'fleeing', 'Thornfield', 'Hall', '2.Middlemarch', 'Individual', 'rating', '3.5', 'starsHaving', 'watched', 'Bleak', 'House', '2005', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '1996', 'scripted', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'was', 'hoping', 'adaptation', 'Middlemarch', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'truly', 'aweful', 'do', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'Middlemarch', 'long', 'complicated', 'novel', 'feel', 'Davies', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'script.I', 'only', 'viewed', 'Middlemarch', 'once', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'purchased', 'part', 'George', 'Eliot', 'BBC', 'collection', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'everything', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'Davies', 'perspective', 'reality', 'viewer', 'felt', 'perspective', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'emotional', 'enough', 'even', 'considering', 'how', 'melancholic', 'certain', 'parts', 'Eliot', 'length', 'novel', 'are.Furthermore', '375', 'minutes', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'justice', 'was', 'done', 'entire', 'cast', 'characters', 'characters', 'really', 'lacked', 'sufficient', 'development.Personally', 'are', 'Eliot', 'afficiando', 'would', 'just', 'wait', 'BBC', 'Middlemarch', 'adaptation', 'Hopefully', 'adaptation', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'Bleak', 'House', '2005', 'least', 'terms', 'character', 'development']",N/A
228548,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,6300248550,anna-joelle,"[13, 14]","A production that runs for 4 hours long, capturing nearly every scene and almost word-for-word dialogue from the novel, and featuring a hero that's so good looking, passionate and likeable (Timothy Dalton's &quot;Mr Rochester&quot;), this is easily the best and thus far, unsurpassed adaption of Charlotte Bronte's famous novel.I agree with the other reviewers that Dalton is too handsome to play Mr Rochester (not that one's complaining). I just have some minor problems concerning Zelah Clarke's portrayal of Jane. I know that Jane Eyre is supposed to be plain-looking in the novel, but I'm surprised that some reviewers even wrote that Zelah Clarke &quot;isn't plain-looking enough&quot;. Goodness me! I think Zelah is too &quot;unpretty&quot; next to Dalton's good looks! For a start, Zelah is too old to play 19-year old Jane (she looks 30). Secondly, her features are quite mousy at times and her face is (I'm sorry to say) almost flat as a pancake! She's also too soft-voiced and quiet. We want to see a more interesting Jane Eyre -one who has more &quot;fire&quot; in her! Fourthly, she's too small-sized and short - her height does not even reach Mr Rochester's shoulders! This makes the hugging and kissing scenes appear rather awkward.But the brilliant acting of Dalton overcomes all flaws and brings this adaptation to life. Watch out for a most touching scene where Mr Rochester cries and beseeches Jane to stay with him at Thornfield after his &quot;secret&quot; is revealed and she decides to go away after finding out that they couldn't marry.

Every character, even the more complex plots of unknown family members (all three siblings are included in this version) every line (practically)is in this version. You really feel Jane's anguish as a child in a confusing adult world. You are saddened when her only friend at Lowood School dies. You see her frustration with certain teachers who only want to suppress her curious nature. you finally feel relief when she grows up to become a teacher herself at Lowood. Then you see her growing affection for Thornfield hall and all that encompasses it. You feel how she feels when she is made to feel inferior to Blanche, and your heartstrings are tugged at when she thinks Mr. Rochester is sending her away to Scotland, far from him. A very touching and intensely romantic scene. There are hundreds of reasons like this that make this version superior to the others. Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy this on DVD!

I first read it in high school and I vivdly recall the hairs standing up on the back of my neck the first time Jane heard ""Grace Pool""'s insane laughter in the night!  This is the most faithful film version I've yet to see.  OK, Timothy Dalton is too handsome to play Rochester, but he has the character nailed to a tee - passionate, tortured, sardonic with just the right level of bitterness at the way ""fortune has knocked me about"".  And Zelah Clark is the best Jane I've come across.  Quiet, understated, but she's no shrinking violet and does not hesitate to stand up to the brooding, unpredictable and intimidating Edward Fairfax Rochester.  And the wonderful dialog comes almost directly from the book.  I think the reason this is the best is because it was a mini-series and could accommodate the entire story (for the same reason the Firth/Ehle version of Pride & Prejudice is the best version of that story).  A two hour movie cannot do either story justice.I absolutely abhored the Zefferelli version - who in their right mind would cast William Hurt as Rochester????  And Charlotte Gainsbourg's Jane was a bit pouty and petulant.  Plus, some scenes were combined or compressed to fit the time requirements distorting the story.  For many of the same reasons, I didn't care for the A&E; version, though Samantha Morton was a pretty good Jane.  But the usually wonderful Ciaran Hinds (see him in Austen's Persuasion) portayed Edward as so overly bitter (bordering on pathetic) that I couldn't see why anyone would fall in love with him.  I don't think that I've ever seen the George C Scott/Trish Van Devere version.  And it's been eons since I've seen the Joan Fontaine/Orson Wells version, but if memory serves, the casting was good, but again, the story was compressed for time and the dialog was subpar.  There are just some lines of dialog that simply MUST be included for me to enjoy any version of this story and if those lines are not there it's curtains!If you are a fan of Jane Eyre, you might want to read a book called Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys.  It's a prequel and tells a version of the story of Edward's time in Jamaica and his marriage to his first wife (a rather strange story focusing on voodoo, slave unrest and her mother's mental instability).

That's not to say that it's not without weaknesses (low budget scenes and tech stuff), but the weaknesses did not detract from the overall portrayal of the novel. Sure, there are soap operatic close-ups on actors to end scenes, but remember, this IS a Victorian novel. There's a natural melodrama about it that those expecting a modern-day version often don't ""get,"" and most likely never will. I, for one, never cared about special effects and musical dance interludes, so I'm probably the wrong person to ask about those things. I like those silly things like plot and character development. And this is where this version truly surpasses other versions. The Joan Fontaine version thoroughly infuriated me with its revisions, and most modern versions don't capture the true natures of Jane and Rochester. Timothy Dalton perfectly rants and broods and runs hot and cold like I envisioned Rochester: a man very close to the edge who can be brought to peace through the love of a passionate woman who has learned to check those passions and use them for good. I agree that he probably is a little too handsome, but I wouldn't say that I couldn't see the ugliness in him. He made me see the trouble and chaos and weariness of the character, and he didn't look pretty. The much-maligned Clark depicts Jane in a way that many underestimate because of its very subtlety. I agree that she appears a little long in the tooth for the role (but I wouldn't exactly card Mary or Diana either), but the irony of the character is that she has a wisdom beyond her years, and maybe that requires an older actress to understand and portray. I think she looked the perfect part of Jane, not pretty or ugly, just exceptionally plain, with a hint at attractive merriment when delighted by something. Her passion does not seem like much to a modern audience, but thinking of the Victorian time, she is exceptionally plain-spoken (with Rochester being off the charts, but forgiven because of his wealth). She guards herself because of the abuse she experienced as a girl, and because of the degradation she experienced as a poor servant in under a society of strict social classes.

228560,AAGK7UK5BHSX4,6300248550,"Born-Identity ""19973""","[9, 9]","I absolutely adore this version. NOT for the studio production (which is not what you would normally expect of BBC), but for the actors Timothy Dalton (who is all passionate male!) and Zelah Clarke who truly portrays the book's Jane Eyre like no other in it's purest adaptation.  The smokin' hot chemistry of Jane and Mr. Rochester from the moment Jane ""bewitches his horse"" *wink* makes you eagerly anticipate each scene they have together. Everyone I have given the DVD to has thoroughly enjoyed it and the story has stuck with them for WEEKS!Although I believe a review should include quality and production information for DVD transfers, IMO to give a romance adaptation series a low star grade based solely on it alone, although the dialogue/set adaptation and acting is top-notch is VERY misleading to the MANY who read reviews to find out about the story, the dialogue, the acting and above all the ROMANCE between the two lead characters. The production doesn't take away from the aforementioned and the wonderful love story that truly unfolds. I'm glad most of the reviewers agree!The dreariness of Thornfield Hall in the first few episodes matched what both Mr. Rochester and Jane's lives were until they literally cross each other's paths. Notice how after they become 'friends' they both light up the room and each other with what is going on behind her dimpled smile and his growing attraction for her. You ride the roller coaster of contradiction that is Mr. Rochester while also wanting to jump through the screen to protect Jane from the unknown. The entire story is no bubble-gum-happy story from beginning to end, but you walk away with a smile on your face because the journey they take you on is not one you will easily forget.This is the romance of all romances - love it!!!**ADDED 11/27/06**I had a 5 day weekend and loaded up on all genres of movies and happen to catch TWO adaptations of Jane Eyre on cable this past weekend that I hadn't seen in quite some time. I watched the William Hurt version, as well as the Orson Welles/Joan Fontaine version and I can now remember quite frankly why both were so easily forgotten by me.First and foremost, there's far too much NECESSARY information revealed in the BBC mini-series version that 2-3 hour movies simply cannot cover. In addition to that, I can't express enough how both Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke's performances are truly believable and exceptionally performed on many levels.  You ""get"" the glimpses of warmth, the humor, the unfolding love and the sense of danger to her emotionally as well as physically. Due to the abruptness of the Orson Welles version (at no fault of it's own) you felt if Jane ended up with someone else, she'd actually be better off.  For me, William Hurt's Mr. Rochester didn't exude the warmth and sincere regret of the book's Mr. Rochester, nor did he embody his magnetism so I pitied that Jane's outcome as well.  This is not the case with the Dalton/Clarke version. I challenge anyone to compare their final Jane and Mr. Rochester scenes (when he realizes she is in the same room with him) to either the Wells or Hurt versions. During the very emotional scenes, Orson and William Hurt (although GREAT actors in other roles) were reading their lines while their beautiful counterparts were simply waiting for them to finish.  Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke's scenes were performed with EVERY facet of their beings completely drawing you into the highly charged moment of what they were both experiencing at the time. At the end of this movie you truly felt there was no other woman for him, nor man for her. You also felt they were equals no matter the other's shortcomings.  Again, in my opinion, there's no comparison of this Jane Eyre to any other version performed.

The middle sister, Emily, wrote _Withering Heights,_ which became one of the golden year, 1939's, films, Charlotte Bront, the eldest, wrote the great romance, Jane Eyre, whic has been issued in multiple editions, and filmed 19 times.The plot is simple:  a ""plain"" young woman, having spent 10 years in an emotionally sterile, still manages to capture the heart of an equally plain man 20 years her senior, loses him, and then, in the end finds him again, after his mad wife has burned down his manor house, taking his eye and hand in the process.  This is not the ordinary meat of a great romance, but somehow over the years, millions of people throughout the world have read and watched this story and come away moved.In this mini-series, the 16th filmed version, Timothy Dalton plays Rochester to Zelah Clarke's Jane.  Dalton is probably one of the ugliest handsome men I've ever seen who nevertheless has played the central character is a number of films (remember his two James Bond movies?).  Clarke is a wonderful character actress, and probably the closest to Bront's decision.  Each of them do expert performances, playing their characters with warmth, humor and great passion.  The sexual tension, never brought to fruition on screen, creates a longing that transfers itself to the viewer.Dalton's character, believing he will never find real love, growls and snaps at everyone around him, never compromises to the world, and unable to show kindness to his ""natural"" child, Ad&eacute;le or any of his servants.  However, his willingness to bring an illegitimate daughter into his house, to be raised as a daughter shows his great heart But as Jane begins to fill his world with a shy joy, he that heart to soften to her.None of the Bront sisters ever married.  It was only through their romances that they could draw their ideal men. The saddest thing about their heroes is that they are all drawn from the withdrawn father who could not show them love.  Their stories are testaments to their beliefs that a gentle woman could change such men's personalities, a dream none of them was able to fulfill.Men and women can related to this romance.

The generous length (11 half-hour installments) ensures that every incident and character from the Bronte novel is depicted, and the characters of Jane and Rochester (their evolvement and eventual romance) are charted subtly and believably.  The adaptation by Alexander Baron captures all the moods and colours from Bronte, with it's gothic horror and sweeping romance.Jane Eyre's rise, from unwelcome ward of the Reed family and pupil of the Lowood school, to naive young governess of Thornfield Hall, is beautifully portrayed by Zelah Clarke, probably the best actress to have played Bronte's difficult heroine.  Timothy Dalton's interpretation of the brooding and mysterious Rochester perfectly complements Clarke's Jane.The supporting cast is first-rate and includes Judy Cornwell (""Keeping Up Appearances"") as Mrs Reed, Jean Harvey as Mrs Fairfax (she was Mrs Reed in the 1973 BBC series), Robert James as Brocklehurst, Blance Youinou as Adele, Sally Osborn as Miss Temple, and Sian Pattenden as the younger Jane.",4,perhaps the definitive screen JANE EYRE,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,1193,"['Having', 'luxury', 'almost', 'six-hour', 'running', 'time', '1983', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'JANE', 'EYRE', 'notable', 'pairing', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'generous', 'length', '11', 'half-hour', 'installments', 'incident', 'character', 'Bronte', 'novel', 'depicted', 'characters', 'Jane', 'Rochester', 'evolvement', 'eventual', 'romance', 'are', 'charted', 'subtly', 'believably', 'adaptation', 'Alexander', 'Baron', 'moods', 'colours', 'Bronte', 'gothic', 'horror', 'sweeping', 'romance.Jane', 'Eyre', 'rise', 'unwelcome', 'ward', 'Reed', 'family', 'pupil', 'Lowood', 'school', 'naive', 'young', 'governess', 'Thornfield', 'Hall', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'probably', 'best', 'actress', 'have', 'played', 'Bronte', 'difficult', 'heroine', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'interpretation', 'brooding', 'mysterious', 'Rochester', 'perfectly', 'Clarke', 'Jane.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'Judy', 'Cornwell', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Appearances', 'Mrs', 'Reed', 'Jean', 'Harvey', 'Mrs', 'Fairfax', 'was', 'Mrs', 'Reed', '1973', 'BBC', 'series', 'Robert', 'James', 'Brocklehurst', 'Blance', 'Youinou', 'Adele', 'Sally', 'Osborn', 'Miss', 'Temple', 'Sian', 'Pattenden', 'younger', 'Jane']",N/A

Such is the life of Jane Eyre-an uncommon girl who's quick wit and sharp tongue have shielded her from abuse by her extended family, her school instructors and her time as governess at Thornfield estate. Directed by Julian Amyes, this eleven-part series moves deftly through the life of Jane but remains faithful to Bronte's story. It is an older production and the camera work is a bit weak, but most of the cast is brilliant, including Sian Pattenden, who plays young Jane. The lead actors, Dalton and Clarke, give strong performances but lack some of the important character traits of Rochester and Eyre. Zelah Clarke plays 19yr old Jane, but Clarke was almost thirty at the time of this production. The age difference gives her more experience and confidence than Jane should have with Rochester. It's more interesting to watch a character struggle against intimidation and when confronted by an imposing man such as Rochester, Clarke was much too composed. However, not all of the fault is Clarke's. Amyes' has a habit of filming scenes from an unnatural distance that results in a loss of intimacy. Film actors shouldn't have to work so hard to be expressive. Their slightest look should speak volumes, but as I've seen from Amyes' other productions like Great Expectations and The Old Curiosity Shop, sometimes he films like we're watching the scenes from a theater which is an unfortunate disservice to his cast.  I agree with many reviewers that Dalton was dashing and exuberant but I think his Rochester was bit more likable than he should have been-considering the life-draining secret hanging over his head. Dalton understood Rochester's manic exterior, but not the overwhelming oppression that must certainly loom over him. However, these points are minor considering the obvious effort made for this over five hour production. The script carried each episode well and at no time did it become tedious. There are many versions of Jane Eyre and I think viewers will find this the one the most fulfilling.",4,Fantastic adaptation with minor flaws,1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,2190,"['wonder', 'how', 'young', 'girl', 'unloved', 'mistreated', 'child', 'cast', 'out', 'brutal', 'institution', 'could', 'develop', 'such', 'intelligent', 'honest', 'loving', 'person', 'Such', 'life', 'Jane', 'Eyre-an', 'uncommon', 'girl', 'who', 'quick', 'wit', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'have', 'shielded', 'abuse', 'extended', 'family', 'school', 'instructors', 'time', 'governess', 'Thornfield', 'estate', 'Directed', 'Julian', 'Amyes', 'eleven-part', 'series', 'moves', 'deftly', 'life', 'Jane', 'faithful', 'Bronte', 'story', 'older', 'production', 'camera', 'work', 'bit', 'weak', 'most', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'including', 'Sian', 'Pattenden', 'who', 'young', 'Jane', 'lead', 'actors', 'Dalton', 'Clarke', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'lack', 'important', 'character', 'traits', 'Rochester', 'Eyre', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', '19yr', 'old', 'Jane', 'Clarke', 'was', 'almost', 'thirty', 'time', 'production', 'age', 'difference', 'more', 'experience', 'confidence', 'Jane', 'should', 'have', 'Rochester', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch', 'character', 'struggle', 'intimidation', 'when', 'confronted', 'imposing', 'man', 'such', 'Rochester', 'Clarke', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'composed', 'However', 'not', 'fault', 'Clarke', 'Amyes', 'habit', 'filming', 'scenes', 'unnatural', 'distance', 'results', 'loss', 'intimacy', 'Film', 'actors', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'expressive', 'slightest', 'look', 'should', 'speak', 'volumes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Amyes', 'other', 'productions', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'Old', 'Curiosity', 'Shop', 'sometimes', ""'re"", 'watching', 'scenes', 'theater', 'unfortunate', 'disservice', 'cast', 'agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'Dalton', 'was', 'dashing', 'exuberant', 'think', 'Rochester', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'likable', 'should', 'have', 'been-considering', 'life-draining', 'secret', 'hanging', 'head', 'Dalton', 'understood', 'Rochester', 'manic', 'exterior', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'oppression', 'must', 'certainly', 'loom', 'However', 'points', 'are', 'minor', 'considering', 'obvious', 'effort', 'made', 'five', 'hour', 'production', 'script', 'carried', 'episode', 'well', 'time', 'did', 'become', 'tedious', 'are', 'many', 'versions', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'think', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'most', 'fulfilling']",N/A

228569,A1T17LMQABMBN5,6300248550,CoffeeGurl,"[2, 4]","There have been several films or series versions of Jane Eyre out there, but I've only seen this one.  This 1983 adaptation of the Charlotte Bronte classic brings up the best things I like about the book with brilliant performances, but Timothy Dalton (of James Bond fame) takes the cake here!  All of us who have read Jane Eyre know about the orphan girl who is sent to a boarding school by her uncaring aunt and the struggles she goes through in that school and how she grows to be a teacher and later governess at the Thornfield Hall, where she meets the brooding Mr. Rochester, falls in love with him and discovers his secrets.  All I can say about this production is that it brings the emotions and twists known from one of, if not the best gothic love story ever written.As said earlier, Timothy Dalton brings Mr. Rochester to life in a compelling performance.  He is able to portray Mr. Rochester as the dark, brooding, complex hero with a deep secret and fascination for plain Jane in a way that touched me very much, especially in the last episode, where I was brought to tears.  Dalton is gorgeous, which I find strange, for Rochester is often described as being unattractive in the book.  Bronte went as far as describing him as being ugly in several occasions.  But it doesn't matter.  It is nice to have some eye candy in an adaptation.  Besides, Timothy Dalton's acting is topnotch and that, to me, is the most important thing.  And I couldn't have pictured a better person for Mr. Rochester, who I always liked more than Mr. Darcy in any event.  I was underwhelmed, however, with Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre.  Even though she was properly cast due to her plain looks (or at least she was made to look plain), I don't think she captured Jane's independent spirit enough.  The whole point to an adaptation is to show Charlotte Bronte's impressive views on feminism -- impressive because her views were far ahead of her time.  Clarke lacked a certain... something and I'm disappointed with her performance.  I do like how the actress brings to life Jane's quiet confidence though.  And I do like the chemistry between Clarke and Dalton because they made you feel the romantic and sexual tension between Jane and Mr. Rochester throughout the series.  Clarke gave her best performances when she worked with Dalton, who I once again have to duly praise his sensual delivery of Rochester.  I was also duly impressed with young Sian Pattenden as the ten-year-old Jane Eyre.  Her acting was quite impressive and she played the heroine just as I had imagined her to be as a child.  All in all, this miniseries with eleven half-hour episodes is wonderful.  The quality of the production isn't the best I've seen, but considering this was filmed in 1983, I think it does the book justice.  I highly recommend this BBC production, if only for Timothy Dalton as the striking Mr. Rochester.",4,A wonderful adaptation of the gothic classic... LOVE Dalton's Mr. Rochester!

My first time through, I was disappointed in the cinematography and felt at times that I was watching a play rather than a movie.  (Having been a HUGE fan of A&E;'s Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, my standards were set pretty high and this version of Jane Eyre could not compare.)  BUT, I have watched this movie several more times and find that I like it better each time.  This is by far the best version available.The acting is VERY GOOD.  Timothy Dalton plays a great Rochester.  True he is handsome, but in a rugged sort of way.  I thought he played the many sides of Rochester's character very well.  Zelah Clarke was a pretty good Jane, (although I would have liked to see her show a little more emotion during some of the scenes).The others in the cast were very good too.  Many of the characters were just as I imagined them to be.  In particular, I thought the actor who played ST John Rivers looked and played the part perfectly.I enjoyed watching many of the scenes from the book that tend to get cut in the other versions (the gypsy scene and Jane begging in Whitcross for example) and much of the dialogue comes straight from the book.Despite the poor (or dated) cinematography, everything else about the movie was really very good and I highly recommend it.",4,Gets better each time I watch it,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,1360,"['received', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Christmas', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'disappointed', 'cinematography', 'felt', 'times', 'was', 'watching', 'play', 'rather', 'movie', 'Having', 'been', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'A', 'E', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'standards', 'were', 'set', 'pretty', 'high', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'could', 'not', 'compare', 'BUT', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'find', 'like', 'better', 'time', 'far', 'best', 'version', 'available.The', 'acting', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'great', 'Rochester', 'True', 'handsome', 'rugged', 'sort', 'way', 'thought', 'played', 'many', 'sides', 'Rochester', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Jane', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'show', 'little', 'more', 'emotion', 'scenes', '.The', 'others', 'cast', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'Many', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'imagined', 'be', 'particular', 'thought', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'ST', 'John', 'Rivers', 'looked', 'played', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'many', 'scenes', 'book', 'tend', 'get', 'cut', 'other', 'versions', 'gypsy', 'scene', 'Jane', 'begging', 'Whitcross', 'example', 'much', 'dialogue', 'straight', 'book.Despite', 'poor', 'dated', 'cinematography', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

What a terrible actress! Honestly, I could have done better! In no way whatsoever does she make you believe that she's Jane, or anyone else for that matter. And, to pair her with Timothy Dalton, well, upstaging is the obvious result.Many people have written in here that they think this version follows the book to the letter. Well it doesn't, although I must say that it is better than the rest of the movie versions of this book. If you're not familiar with this version, it is filmed in a soap-opera type way, no full movie version here. It's very low budget and the actors, well. To be blunt, if you're wanting to know the story of Jane Eyre but don't want to tackle the book (by the way, that's the ONLY way you're going to understand what Miss Bronte was trying to say), then grab the 2007 version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson as Jane. No, it doesn't follow the book hardly at all and should actually be called, ""A story based on Jane Eyre,"" but the acting is tremendous and you WILL be forced to read the book after watching that movie! It's hands down, just awesome.What bothered me a lot about this version is that the screenwriter has Dalton telling Jane to leave after she comes back from Morton and finds him injured and blind. He NEVER says that in the book and quite frankly, is so overwhelmed that she returned to him that he asks her to marry him within the day. You just cannot take away from Miss Bronte's writing of this story or you'll mess up the whole meaning of it. Creative writing of a classic just looks foolish at best and gets in the way of what might have been a fantastic movie. And, another bad portion was how they portrayed Jane as a child - the way it is staged, everyone would want to treat her badly!  READ THE BOOK BEFORE MAKING THE MOVIE!  Jane wasn't like that in the book but in this movie, she's a brat!Again, move on from this one and get the Toby Stephens version of Jane Eyre.

I do agree with the other reviewers that after reading the novel, I imagined Jane as more of a vibrant character. However, I do enjoy Clarke's performance as Jane and contrary to other reviewers, I believed that she appeared to be in her late teens, 18 to 19. I don't see how anyone could see large hips umder the style of dress worn throughout the series. Yes, Jane Eyre is supposed to be a bit homely. It is hard to get past that though, we don't really accept plain on-screen, as a viewing public we flinch if somebody is ""too plain."" I don't think Clarke was too plain, she was my image of Jane from reading the book. However, I agree with the reviewers who described her looking down too much.

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[21, 24]","1983's ""Jane Eyre,"" in spite of its technical flaws, brought the magic back to me of reading ""Jane Eyre"" for the first time.I felt duty bound to watch the 1983 Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke adaptation of ""Jane Eyre,"" because I'd just written an article about the 2006 BBC ""Jane Eyre"" for TheScreamOnline. So, I approached watching this the way I'd approach doing homework.I was irritated at first. The lighting in this version is bad. Everyone / everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters.And the sound is poorly recorded. I felt like I was listening to a high school play.And the pancake make-up is way too heavy.And the sets don't fully convey the Gothic mood of the novel. I just can't see Bronte's Rochester abiding such Martha Stewart domestic arrangements. Orson Welles' Rochester lived in cave-like gloom, very appropriate to the novel's Gothic mood.And yet ... with all those objections ... not only is this the best ""Jane Eyre"" I've seen, it may be the best adaptation of any novel I've ever seen.The critics of this production say it is too close to the book. For me, someone who valued the book and didn't need it to be any less ""wordy"" or any less ""Christian"" or any more sexed-up, this version's faithfulness to the novel Bronte actually wrote is its finest asset.Bronte wrote a darn good book. There's a reason it has lasted 150 years plus, while other, slicker, sexier and easier texts, have disappeared.As a long time ""Jane Eyre"" fan, I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is, famously, not handsome; Jane and Rochester are literature's famous ugly couple. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome.But Dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as Rochester. He just blew me away. I've never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role, the text, the dialogue, and Rochester's love for Jane. Dalton brings the page's Rochester to quivering life on screen.Rochester is meant to be a bit scary. Dalton is scary. Welles got the scary streak down, too, for example, when he shouts ""Enough!"" after Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton is scary more than once, here. You really can't tell if he's going to hurt Jane, or himself, in his desperation.Rochester's imperiousness, his humor, his rage, his vulnerability: Dalton conveys all, sometimes seconds apart. It's stunning.And here's the key thing -- the actor performing Rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair, lonely, living with an ugly, life-destroying secret.No other actor I've seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as Timothy Dalton does. Current fan-favorite Toby Stephens doesn't even try. Dalton hits it out of the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton performing Rochester in a singles bar, i would say, ""That guy is trouble. Don't even look at him."" He's that radioactive with tamped down agony.Zelah Clarke is not only, overall, the best Jane I've seen, she's one of the very few Janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts Jane. No, folks who know ""Jane Eyre"" only from the 2006 BBC version, Bronte did *not* describe a statuesque, robust Jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips. Rather, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is, indeed, poor, plain, obscure, and little, and NOT pretty.Zelah has a small mouth, close-set eyes, and a bit of a nose. She's truly ""little."" She is no fashion model. And she is the best Jane, the truest to the book.Some described her a cold or boring. No, she's true to the book. Bronte's Jane is not a red hot mama, she's a sheltered, deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments, as Zelah's do here. The book's Jane is someone you have to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, observantly, if you want to truly plumb her depths. You have to watch Zelah, here, to get to know who she really is.I would have liked to have seen more fire in Zelah in one key scene, but that's one scene out of five hours in which she is, otherwise, very good.In spite of its closeness to the text, this version, like every other version I've seen, shys away from fully explicating the overtly Christian themes in ""Jane Eyre."" Christianity is not incidental subtext in ""Jane Eyre,"" it is central.Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, thus giving her a subversive, counter cultural way to read, and live, her apparently doomed, pinched life. It is Christianity, and a Christian God, who convinces poor, plain, obscure Jane of her equal worth, her need to live up to her ideals, and her rejection of a key marriage proposal. That isn't made fully clear here.In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex, rich novel, and this adaptation of it, of all the ones I've seen, mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation I've seen, and that says a lot.Other versions, that don't fully honor the book, end up being a chore to watch in many places. If you don't care about what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse, or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester.This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote -- about Jane's experiences at Lowood, and her relationship to St. John -- are part of what makes Jane's relationship to Rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is.",5,Glorious.

I often wonder, when they got it right the first time, why did the BBC keep on making newer versions?  As one who has actually read the book as well as a few biographies about Charlotte Bronte and a history of the Bronte family, I know that developing a screen play based on this huge and complex novel is not an easy undertaking. And, as one can tell by viewing the various adaptations, depending on the literary outlook, different aspects and themes are emphasized.In this version, undertaken in the early 1980s when Feminism was a virtue, Jane consistently emphasizes that she wishes to remain an ""independent"" woman. She is willing to be the helpmeet of her cousin who has been called to India to perform missionary service but does not wish to marry him. He is tall and blonde and blue-eyed and handsome, but unlike Mr. Rochester who she likens to a `Vulcan', he does not love her. More than anything else, Jane wishes to be loved, which may explain her penchant for teaching little children who love unconditionally (although truth be told, little else was available for educated women of no means in those times).  The woman's movement, underway in 19th Century England when the book was published made JANE EYRE an overnight hit, especially with ""the lady readers"" who sought their basic civil rights. This adaptation, emphasizing the desire for personal liberty relies on the words Jane speaks in the book.Produced with the technology of the times, so it was originally filmed, the transfer to DVD is excellent. Moreover, if you saw the film `Wide Sargasso Sea' ( based on a controversial book and modern novel posing as a  literary ""forerunner"" to JANE EYRE which introduces racism into the mix) starring Nathaniel Parker as the young Edward Rochester, you can easily believe that Timothy Dalton could have been the same man, and that the beautiful young mentally ill wife had evolved into the hideous creature hidden in the attic.Bronte introduced a complicated plot with many elements used by modern writers.  For example, St John's heartless proposal recalls Hiram Bingham's proposal to Jerusha Bromley in Michner's HAWAII. And, the destruction of Mr Rochester's ancestral home and the legacy of a first wife are reminiscent of conditions in REBECCA.The Bronte sisters were geniuses who were female victims when women could only dream of being ""independent"" and exercising the free will they believed God had given them and men taken away.

Directed by the talented Julian Amyes and scripted/adapted by Alexander Baron, it is really the finest of adaptations. Because it is so dated, however, be wary of the ""Dr. Who""-type studio filming, which America abandoned in the mid-1970s.The most faithful adaptation of Charlotte Bront's great work, JANE EYRE boasts some rather daring scenes considering it was first televised in 1983. (Right around the same time as THE PICKWICK PAPERS miniseries was televised, see my review.)Mr. Rochester (a very dashing Timothy Dalton in his career-launching starring role) snarls and snaps out orders; but Dalton with his rich baritone and weepy eyes conveys Rochester in a deep way that is unequalled. Even Orson Welles' 1944 noir version does not compare (but this miniseries borrows from Welles, as the later JANE EYRE tv films borrowed heavily from this.)I think what bugged me the most was the casting of unknown-in-America Zelah Clarke as Jane (also properly called ""Janet"", to be heard only in this version). Jane is supposed to be 18, and I know they cast her with too old an actress, as Mr. Rochester is always cast just right (he is supposed to be 38). Zelah looks old enough to be Tim Dalton's sister, and that ruins a lot of the drama. It makes it unintentionally laughable the way Dalton keeps telling Clarke ""I'm 20 years your senior! Old enough to be your father!""The bigger problem with Clarke is her face. Truly, she has the weirdest and ugliest eyes I have ever seen: like a wild, randy Bassett hound. The lines around her features also match that particular breed's lines. It is clownish, and it sounds mean of me--but it is the truth. Why oh why not just have cast a plain 20-year-old?Of the 11 episodes at 25 minutes each, Dalton was in 9 and Clarke was in 10 of them. This is due to the rather heavily leaned-on early years, which I always found the most unbearable bore in Jane's story. The later films do quite right by paring it down to essentials.One thing impressive here was the time Jane spends with her cousins including the odious, delusional St. John Eyre-Rivers. Here is a man who thinks his will is God's will, and Jane, in my opinion, never did show enough disgust at such effrontery. Sounding like a jihadist, he tells Jane she is defying God's will by not marrying him. What a jerk, and to see him so fairly adapted in the later films always angered me.So expect beautiful, intense acting, lush exteriors and locations, slightly shabby studio interiors, and fun.

The latter provides considerably more dramatic involvement &passion.Zelah Clark 'may' be more the way Charlotte Bronte described her, she's plain, short,etc.  But she seems almost passionless most of the time, & re: her appearance,one has to decide whether to opt for physical description that most closely matcheswhat CB described OR an appearance & performance that was most dramatically involving.  But, worst of all, Clark seems almost passionless which hurtsthe production, I'd say a great deal.I wld opt for the latter, & I thought Mia Wasikowska's performance in the 2011film was spellbinding, an A plus acting job (meaning she never seemed to be acting).  That made a big difference in making the movie exceptionally dramatically involving & with some extroardinarily passionate/moving scenes.It takes patience & a # of viewing times of two, maybe 3 hrs to watch this version.

228591,A2BPDFR58H9575,6300248550,Galina,"[4, 5]","Last night I finished re-watching ""Jane Eyre"" (1983), the BBC mini-series adapted from Charlotte Bronte's Gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of English literature with Timothy Dalton (my favorite James Bond) as Mr. Edward Rochester and Zelah Clarke, as Jane Eyre, a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl, a governess at Mr. Rochester's estate, Thornfield. ""Jane Eyre"" has been one of my most beloved books since I was an 11-years-old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words, ""This book is amazing"" and so it was and I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it. Its beautiful language, refined, fragrant, and surprisingly fresh, the dialogs, and above all, two main characters, and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers. ""Jane Eyre"" has been adapted to TV and big screen many times, 18 according to IMDb. The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Samantha Morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society, laws, religion, by the differences in age, backgrounds, experiences, and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years. Of all these films I've only seen one, 300 minutes long BBC version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where Timothy Dalton who frequently plays dark, brooding characters does not just played Edward Rochester brilliantly and with class, he WAS Mr. Rochester - sardonic, vibrant, the force of nature, powerful, passionate, sexy, and tormented master of Thornfield.

Timothy Dalton pairs perfecty with her.  He has a very imposing presence and his emotions are explosive.  Physically they are a great pairing too.  She's tiny and very plain.  He's enormous compared to her and his dramatic, but not quite hansome, looks make him ""beastly""  like Mr. Rochester should be.  I think this is the most filled out version too, but it doesn't drag.  Each episode has poigniant moments to look forward to. I also like how there are less cut aways and close-ups like more recent version.  Instead its played in the older style which is more like watching a play.  This can be boring in other movies but works here because the actors are so interesting. You can watch how their interactions unfold without feeling interupted. The result is that it seems very naturalistic and raw.Timothy Dalton's best role!! (of course, I'm not a James Bond type :S)P.S. A very different version that I also like is the newest version with Michael Fassbender as Rochester.  It's strengths are more in the tone created by the camera's aristry.  This one also has an interesting dynamic between the two leads.  It is very moving although it comes across very different than in this version.  That version is a little rushed though and suffer's most in the final scene with an all too breif endingP.P.S. I just wanted to note with curiosity that the picture Amazon posted for this movie is of a woman but it's not Zelah Clarke!  I don't think that woman is even in this!! :P**EDIT 12/11/11**  They put a picture up from the real show!  Also...I noticed Zelah in another period film, Lady Jane.

And I loved the fact they were quite faithful to the marvelous dialogue in the book.The only real problem I had with it, and I think it took away from how much I liked it, was Jane.  I just found myself unable to see her as I had seen her in the book.  She was supposed to be young, timid and shy, but at the same time bold and definat.  Clarke's too soft voice and her often expressionless face- she had a perpetual, almost annoying frown.  In addition, her lack of expression was a sharp contrast to Dalton's almost theatrical (even if overrdone) performance.  In addition, she was too much shorter than him and not nearly lithe enough or fairy-like to be Jane.  She wasn't an &quot;unearthly thing&quot; at all, she was too prudish and grounded.  Her awful costumes didn't help any.But not too complain too much.  I suppose the real enjoyment is to read the book and imagine your own Jane and Mr. Rochester.  I liked seeing this version though.

228599,AQ5NFBZYOHNQ6,6300248550,"JB ""bookworm""","[24, 24]","There are many adaptations of Charlotte Bront's classic novel ""Jane Eyre"", and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best. The short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a 100 min. length, consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel. The TV series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroine's life.There are three TV mini series, released in '73, '83 and 2006. The 2006 version is not only the worst of these three, but the worst of all Jane Eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film. The novel's beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones, and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel. What it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the Rochester and Jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book, but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set. It is a silly soap opera, in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake. This ""Jane Eyre"" (as it dares to call itself) is indeed a slap in the face of Charlotte Bront.The 1973 version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between Mr. Rochester and Jane are rendered in nearly their full length. But what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen. At times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen, and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by Jane's voice-overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess. And despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured. Another problem is the casting of the main characters. Sorcha Cusack's portrayal of Jane as a bold, self-confident, worldly-wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model, and Michael Jayston, although a good actor, does simply not possess the commanding physical presence or the charisma necessary to play Rochester. Although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience.All the faults of the '73 version stand corrected in the TV mini series of '83 with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Although from a purist's point of view Timothy Dalton is too handsome, tall and lean to be Rochester, he possesses the essential qualities for the role: He has an imposing physical presence, great magnetism and an air of self-assurance and authority. And despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of Thornfield convincingly. But the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of Rochester's character. Of all the actors who have played Rochester he is the only one to capture them all: Rochester's harshness, nearly insolence, his moodiness and abruptness, as well as his humorous side, his tenderness, his solicitude and deep, frantic love. Dalton's handling of Charlotte Bront's language is equally superb. Even Rochester's most far-fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when Dalton delivers them. He is the definitive Rochester, unsurpassed and unsurpassable, and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine Rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor.Zelah Clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of Rochester. She portrays exactly the Jane of the novel, an outwardly shy, reserved and guarded young woman, but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will. She catches beautifully the duality in Jane's character: her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand, and her fire and passion on the other, her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong. She and Dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight.As regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the '73 version, but with one important difference: The dialogues are shortened in this version, but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged. Thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech, while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of Charlotte Bront's language. And in contrast to the earlier BBC version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured.The plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the '73 series. It is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel, where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of Jane's life. It is the only Jane Eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel, and the only one which does full justice to the novel's pivotal and most heartrending scene when Jane and Rochester meet after the aborted wedding. Timothy Dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill. He renders with almost painful intensity Rochester's anguish as he realizes Jane's resolution to leave him, his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him. It is a heartbreaking, almost devastating, scene, which will stay with the viewer for a long time.With even the smaller roles perfectly cast, an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true ""Jane Eyre"".",5,Unsurpassed and Unsurpassable,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,5857,"['are', 'many', 'adaptations', 'Charlotte', 'Bront', 'classic', 'novel', 'Jane',

Frequently, video adaptations of novels are weak substitutes and leave you disappointed, since the characters and scenes from your imagination are far richer than any shortened screen adaptation can ever be. Now, having seen this lavish BBC production starring Timothy Dalton as the irascible Rochester and Zelah Clarke as the irrepressible Jane, I can't imagine them any other way.The video production was very accurate and true to the novel, leaving out non-critical scenes and some dialogue, but not changing events or people or altering the outcome in any way. At just under 4 hours, you may want to take several days to view the video, but you won't regret the time spent. The themes of feminine strength, love and forgiveness are still relevant today, hundreds of years after Charlotte Bronte wrote the book.

Scott one has some value if only for the scenery.Zelah Clark is Jane Eyre, she starts out as homely as Charlotte describes her, but as she falls in love with Rochester, and he with her, she blossoms, and becomes beautiful...but she always was.  Timothy Dalton is the BEST Rochester, he IS dark and brooding, he is imperious and mysterious, he fits Bronte's Rochester description to a T.  I think that this version makes the underlying story come to light.  Two broken betrayed people find each other, understand each other's pain and make the other beautiful if only to each other.

Of course the empire waist is only attractive on a very slender woman and this is not a slender woman. In those costumes she looks pregnant. Way too much bust. And, her neck is so thick. Jane is supposed to be very small and thin.  And, then, there are the ever present lumps on her chin - acne?, moles they choose to cover up with makeup instead of darkening to at least make them appear to be moles (beauty marks).  You may get away with defects like this on a small t.v. screen but when blown up on a 60 inch screen, there they are - larger than life. Of course Timothy Dalton is too handsome for the role but does a good job.  I'm only about 3/4 through the first VHS tape and find Jane's appearance so distracting that it interferes with the enjoyment of the movie.  Adele is too large a child for the role. She is almost as big as the actress portraying Jane. I've seen many  movie versions of this story and find it hard to believe that such an ambitious effort should be so marred by miscasting.  So far, the story seems to be pretty close to the script.  I hope this will continue. I'll continue to watch it but don't think she is going to get any thinner. Every time Rochester refers to her as ""fairylike"" or something similar from the book you just want to burst out laughing. I sure am glad I didn't spring for the higher priced DVD but instead bought the much cheaper VHS tapes. LATER: I have now finished looking at this and my opinion remains the same. If it were not for the casting of Jane, this would be my favorite version of the book as it contains most of the last part of the story after Jane leaves Thornfield Hall. Also, Dalton is a very appealing Rochester even if a bit too good looking.  It would appear that this actress is quite short as I always supposed Jane to be but, unfortunately, in these costumes and on the wide screen, she appears to be almost as big around as she is tall. Rather like an elderly Queen Victoria from the back. Take 25 lbs off her and she would fit the role as she has a very nice face with lovely eyes. I would be willing to overlook the large lump on her chin which seemed to appear, disappear then reappear according, I assume, to when certain scenes were shot. SEVERAL DAYS LATER - I looked at this movie on a 2l inch square screen t.v. set and she looks much better. You can still see the lumps on her face but they aren't right there staring at you as they are on a 60 inch screen. And the square screen doesn't make her look so chubby.

While I feel the very best film of this is the Welles/Fontaine version of the 1940s, I agree wholeheartedly with the glowing ecstatic review of ""Borovnian Heir.""  This is a definitive version of Jane Eyre.  Very thorough and true to the beloved book.I do very much like the tone and the visual stylishness of the Orson Wells/Joan Fontaine version, but I agree that the actress, THIS Jane Eyre, Zelah Clarke is the perfect fit, and because this is a miniseries, we feel as if we are living with her day by day.Orson Wells was a great Rochester - he had a dislikable quality that fits with Rochester as written, and his looks are ""jolie laide"" (handsome ugly).  Here, Timothy Dalton succeeds as Rochester in spite of his craggy handsomeness.  James Bond is one of the most handsome men in the world, after all... but if one looks at what was considered handsome in THAT day and age, he was not it.  Handsome men of that time were usually pale and soft.  So he works, and he is spellbinding to watch.  His personal qualities as an actor suit Rochester well.The supporting cast is great, and you'll be surprised to see Judy Cornwall - Daisy from ""Keeping Up Appearances"" as a very frustrated and sympathetic Aunt.  This version of the Aunt is perhaps not what Bronte envsioned, but she is very real and nuanced.  This is not an evil woman, but a small minded woman who just doesn't know what to do with children.

(note: i loved ciaran hinds as mr. rochester in the 1997 adaptation, but the movie was too short to encompass everything.)zelah clarke is not my favorite jane eyre (samantha morton from 1997 feels the perfect jane, to me). physically she might be a little old looking for jane, but she is tiny which is accurate to the book. clarke's eyre was just 'ok' and dalton's rochester was perfect. not sure if this is a result of him being a better actor, or just that this was the way she interpreted the character of jane eyre. in any event, she is satisfactory.the embraces they share are not as perfect as i'd like them to be. something is a bit off- cant put my finger on it- but again, its satisfactory.a word on the lighting. it is really awful, no doubt. someone else here mentioned the old tv program ""dark shadows"" and/or bad soap opera lighting. i agree. its unfortunate but if you're a real bronte fan, you will get around it for the performance value.when i first saw the movie, the child cast seemed for the most part amateurs. between this and the sets and lighting, i was laughing a bit at the low quality. however, i persisted and i'm glad i did. to my surprise, i wound up really getting caught up in it after she gets to thornfield. now i can't get enough of it, especially the key scenes between jane and edward.it was refreshing to see such detailed accounts of what happens to jane when she leaves rochester. the guy who played mr. rivers was terrific.i felt the ending was a little anticlimactic, which is disappointing. i feel that when she finally agreed to marry him, after all they had been through, it should have been a more passionate scene. (again, as in that same scene in the ciaran hinds/samantha morton adaptation, which felt like it met the more appropriate height of passion).so not perfect, but still very enjoyable and follows the book more closely than any other movie so far. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT DESPITE IT'S FAULTS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN OF THE ORIGINAL STORY.i have heard that bbc just put out another jane eyre miniseries this year but i've not seen it. not on dvd yet.",4,The good outweighs the bad!,1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,3001,"['i', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'putting', 'two', 'cents', 'pence', 'here', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'shared', 'feelings', 'adaptation.first', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'length', 'production', 'attention', 'detailed', 'accounts', 'only', 'surpassed', 'reading', 'book', 'are', 'huge', 'driving', 'force', 'adaptation', 'so', 'wonderful', 'story', 'too', 'long', 'fit', 'typical', 'length', 'feature', 'so', 'thankfully', 'production', '311', 'minutes', 'long', 'thrill', 'chase', 'conversations', 'jane', 'edward', 'are', 'critical', 'other', 'adaptations', ""'re"", 'always', 'cut', 'out', 'shortened', 'so', 'passion', 'struggles', 'lack', 'strong', 'foundation.i', 'must', 'say', 'dalton', 'performance', 'really', 'impressed', 'was', ""n't"", 'tall', 'handsome', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'physically', 'perfect', 'i', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'probably', 'saved', 'adaptation', 'mediocrity', 'note', 'i', 'loved', 'ciaran', 'hinds', 'mr.', 'rochester', '1997', 'adaptation', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'encompass', 'everything', 'zelah', 'clarke', 'not', 'favorite', 'jane', 'eyre', 'samantha', 'morton', '1997', 'feels', 'perfect', 'jane', 'physically', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'old', 'looking', 'jane', 'tiny', 'accurate', 'book', 'clarke', 'eyre', 'was', 'just', ""'ok"", 'dalton', 'rochester', 'was', 'perfect', 'not', 'sure', 'result', 'being', 'better', 'actor', 'just', 'was', 'way', 'interpreted', 'character', 'jane', 'eyre', 'event', 'satisfactory.the', 'embraces', 'share', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'perfect', 'i', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'something', 'bit', 'off-', 'cant', 'put', 'finger', 'it-', 'again', 'satisfactory.a', 'word', 'lighting', 'really', 'awful', 'doubt', 'someone', 'else', 'here', 'mentioned', 'old', 'tv', 'program', 'dark', 'shadows', 'and/or', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', 'lighting', 'i', 'agree', 'unfortunate', ""'re"", 'real', 'bronte', 'fan', 'will', 'get', 'performance', 'value.when', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'child', 'cast', 'seemed', 'most', 'part', 'amateurs', 'sets', 'lighting', 'i', 'was', 'laughing', 'bit', 'low', 'quality', 'however', 'i', 'persisted', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', 'did', 'surprise', 'i', 'wound', 'up', 'really', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'thornfield', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'especially', 'key', 'scenes', 'jane', 'edward.it', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'such', 'detailed', 'accounts', 'what', 'jane', 'when', 'rochester', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'mr.', 'rivers', 'was', 'terrific.i', 'felt', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'anticlimactic', 'disappointing', 'i', 'feel', 'when', 'finally', 'agreed', 'marry', 'had', 'been', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'passionate', 'scene', 'again', 'same', 'scene', 'ciaran', 'hinds/samantha', 'morton', 'adaptation', 'felt', 'met', 'more', 'appropriate', 'height', 'passion', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'book', 'more', 'closely', 'other', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMEND', 'IT', 'DESPITE', 'IT', 'FAULTS', 'ESPECIALLY', 'IF', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'A', 'TRUE', 'FAN', 'THE', 'ORIGINAL', 'STORY.i', 'have', 'heard', 'bbc', 'just', 'put', 'out', 'jane', 'eyre', 'miniseries', 'year', 'i', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'not', 'dvd', 'yet']",N/A

Timothy Dalton is an absolutely superb Rochester!I've seen about five different versions of ""Jane Eyre"" and except for Orson Welles (nobody will ever surpass him in that role, and the Welles-Fontaine movie positively butchered the book), Dalton is far and away the best Rochester I have seen to date.  Brooding, sensitive, temperamental, passionate -- he brought the whole role to life.  When I re-read ""Jane Eyre"" (and I've only re-read it umpteen-zillion times and counting), I see Dalton as Rochester.  He and Welles share ownership of this part.Zelah Clarke makes a very effective Jane, and the rest of the cast does a creditable job, but this movie belongs to Timothy Dalton.  It's also, for Bronte purists, one of the versions that sticks closest to the original story.  The one jarring note for this reviewer was the young actress who played Jane in childhood.  Young Jane was supposed to be small and thin but this young lady, although she is a fairly good actress, looked like she could go up against Mia Hamm in a soccer match and give her a run for her money.However, this is a minor cavil.

While I've thoroughly enjoyed the screen versions of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and MANSFIELD PARK, Charlotte Bronte's JE, I'm afraid, draws a line in the sand that I cannot cross.This 1983 cinematic release of JE is, as I understand it, a faithful rendering of the original written work - a claim I have no desire to verify by reading the latter. In any case, Jane (Zelah Clarke) is an orphan, raised initially by an unloving benefactress and then in a school for girls, who at 18 comes to live at Thornfield Hall, the great house of Mr. Rochester (Timothy Dalton), where Jane is employed as governess to Rochester's illegitimate daughter. Both Jane and Rochester are extremely lonely individuals, and the course of their subsequent emotional relationship is overwrought and melodramatic to an extreme. The ""thorn"" in Thornfield is apt, especially as it relates to the dark secret which Rochester hides in a garret room.One cannot fault the quality of the production or the acting, and I'll allow three stars in recognition. Clarke is superb as the somber but independent Jane whose emotions are continuously buffeted. Dalton is perfect as the darkly handsome and brooding Rochester. The costuming seems impeccable (though I'm in no expert position to judge). And the locations of the shoot, while gloomy, are at least in England, a green and otherwise pleasant land that is my spiritual home.I loved Austen's P&P;, S&S; and MP for the wry and sometimes mischievous humor demonstrated by those stories' respective heroines. JANE EYRE lacks any humor whatsoever. It's unrelentingly dark, gloomy and depressing. Even the scene where Jane has her fortune told by the gypsy woman is not so much a crack in the dark tenor of the storyline as another one of Rochester's manic mood swings. One wishes Rochester would just snap out of it.My opinion of JE is liable to be roundly excoriated by Bronte fans. That's fine. I still wouldn't recommend it unless one is seeking to come down precipitously from an emotional high.

Ann Seeton,"[2, 2]","I was skeptical that a modern rendition of this story could do it justice; so often, the more modern adaptations use a story from another era to promote modern issues and thus do violence to the story itself and to my delight, this version avoids that sin. No adaptation is perfect but this one does a better job than most.  At times, the story drags slightly, but what pleased me into five stars is how thoroughly this story is transferred from the book to the movie adaptation.  Clearly, choosing to make this a mini-series was the correct choice as this gives the opportunity to be so thorough.I loved the development of the relationship between Rochester and Jane, the book leaves murky the efforts of Rochester to bring Jane from her limited view of her position in society to the mature declaration of their equality and this adaptation seemed to me to show this more clearly.Timothy Dalton played Rochester brilliantly.  He managed to convey the layers of the character in a way that other performances of this role lack.  His performance conveyed the affection Rochester felt toward Jane even though his many machinations, in particular, the warmth of his gaze in many scenes. The scene after the gypsy fortune-teller incident where Rochester responds to the news that Mason has arrived showed how his heart had come to rely on her support and was, in my opinion, particularly sensitively played.As for the many other actor performances I was not unhappy with the performance of any of the other roles. I thought that Mrs. Reed was played with a bit more contrition on the part of that character than is in the book but it did not jar.  The story did ignore the Reed sisters' fates which was disappointing.  St.John Rivers was handled well, with his steel will in resisting romance and disciplining himself in a strongly Calvinist manner giving a proper chill to how fond the viewer might have felt of him.  I especially liked the way the housekeeper's part was managed with the firmness of guarding the door, protectiveness of her family and the warmth of the housekeeper once the need to resist intrusions was gone; all were well handled.The details of Jane's childhood were faithfully followed. John Reed played the role of the cruel bully quite nicely and his and Aunt Reed's attitudes toward Jane contrasted nicely with the role of the kindly sympathetic doctor.  After she went to school, the miniseries showed a bit more anti-Catholicism than did the book although not inappropriately for a Calvinist religious view of that era; the film developed the friendship between Helen and Jane without the confusing elements of Helen's reading preferences which was a good thing; however, there was a lack of focus on the epidemic that swept the school and took Helen's life.  It seems rather odd to add to the Calvinism with a teacher speaking a highly anti-Catholic line (however appropriate) and then to avoid fully portraying the depth of the greed in the management of the school and to skip over the later choice of the one Reed sister to join a convent in France.  If a religious prejudice is to be emphasized in one place then the balances to it, found in other places in the book, should not be avoided, nor should the sins of the Calvinist elements be lessened.The efforts of Rochester to keep Jane after the truth came out were handled beautifully with the full scope of all the emotions portrayed quite well. The levels of degradation Jane experienced while alone and lost on the moors and wandering friendless and without money were thoroughly managed, even to the initial reception at the River's home, were transferred from the book to the film with far more detail intact than in most versions of this story.I liked that the link of relatedness between Jane and the Rivers family was established properly as it made the distribution of the fortune make sense.  Her enthusiasm for finding family to love was faithful to the book and acted brilliantly.The scenes with Jane and the injured Rochester were marred by the worst make-up job I have scene on film. My high school theater group had better make-up artists!  I don't understand why, after doing such a fabulous job with the rest of the mini-series, that this was permitted to stand.  I think the actors were handicapped by awareness that the scars were coming loose during filming and it limited the scope of emotion portrayed. With better make-up these scenes might have been as well acted as the earlier scenes between Jane and Rochester. In spite of the make-up fiasco, the ending scenes were satisfactory.Of the many film adaptations of this book, this mini-series is my favorite.  I feel that it does the best and most thorough job of transferring the complete book to film without adding junk or leaving out essentials.

I think Timothy Dalton  is fierce yet vulnerable and as another reveiwer put it perfectly. Yes he is good looking, yet craggy enough that he fits to perfection the part of ""tortured"" Mr Rochester. Yes there are faults with the mini series, the early 1980s lighting is a bit too sterile and bright,that is bleaches out many contrasts and drama to the landscape of the film. Mr Rochesters charge, Aldele whom Jane teaches has a very poor french accent, her very british accent is very evident as she speaks her brief lines in french. Aside from all those minor things, I do like the feeling and the trueness this film has to the book. It takes you in from the moment you start to finish.  It really is wonderful.Other Jane Eyre versions I like are the recent one done wirh Toby Stevens. Though it has a more contemporary take on the story of Jane. It really is very refreshing to view. I also like the 1944 Orson Wells version for its gothic victorian film Noire style. The most recent version is fairly nice too, but The actor who plays Rochester is too wooden for my taste.

228619,A3EFDLX43LT7OM,6300248550,Kathryn Atwood,"[4, 5]","If you are looking the most accurate adaptation of ""Jane Eyre,"" this is it. It's got everything from the book that the screenwriters could pack into four hours.  However, like all of the BBC productions that I've seen, this looks like it was filmed with a video camera.  I absolutely love the book, but part of me also loves film and this is so low budget that there's not really much action or even movement during certain scenes.  People stand or sit in one spot for long periods of time spouting words -- beautifully exact words, mind you -- but it does get quite visually boring sometimes.Speaking of visuals: Timothy Dalton is skinnier and taller than Rochester is supposed to be.  Zelah Clarke is short, but way too filled out and her character is too perky; she is supposed to be outwardly suppressed, though inwardly intense.  And these leads are supposed to be 20 years apart -- Dalton and Clark look to be about the same age.  That being said, there is some great chemnistry between them; the passion between Jane and Rochester -- the focal point of the story -- is absolutely palbable in this adaptation.No other ""Jane Eyre"" film will give you so much straight-out-of-the-book dialogue and no other adaptation has the Rochester-as-gypsy scene or an accurate portrayal of the River's family and Jane's relationships with them.

They run credits before and after each episode as it was originally shown on PBS [here in the USA]. This is quite annoying to me, and I can find no good reason to have put it on this way. The only thing that occurs to me is that it was easier for someone to transfer it on to the disc. It is wonderful to have the entire version as it was originally produced. It tells the whole book better than any of the other productions. This DVD restores all the parts that were 'cut' from the VHS four hour copy, and we now have at least 5 hours of it (it seems like more). I like this.

I read the novel then, and ever since (20+years) it's been my absolute favorite book.  I re-read it at least once a year.  I was thrilled to find the VHS version of this BBC miniseries about 15 years ago, and I have never seen a film that so well captured the essence of the book.  The series may seem a bit long, but for those of us who savor Charlotte Bronte's novel, it's wonderful! Timothy Dalton IS Rochester,and Zelah Clarke is a marvelous Jane.  Some say she was too old to play Jane; I disagree... she was approximately 25 years old when the movie was made.  Hardly ancient.  I have also seen reviews that call her fat.  She is definitely NOT...I have seen pictures of her in modern dress and she is rather petite.  The wardrobe in the movie made her look a bit dumpy, but then, Jane Eyre is NOT a beauty!  I think she had plenty of spirit and spunk in this film and it's truly a shame that her acting career didn't take off after this role.I have seen other versions of Jane Eyre; Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton did a decent job, but the story was hacked to bits; William Hurt was a HORRIBLE Rochester.  He had no spirit..dull, listless,and passionless. UGH.  I even rented the movie once to see if it was as bad as I'd remembered it from the theater.  YUP.  People who are true afficianados of the book will love this production.  Some of the movie making is a little under par (this is a made for TV miniseries, and is 20 years old, after all), but the script and the acting make up for the poor makeup and lighting.  I give it thumbs WAY WAY WAY UP!!UPDATE:  I received my DVD today (Thanks to Amazon for shipping it so that I received it on the day it was released!  Woohoo!!)  The restored footage was marvelous...no new footage of Timothy Dalton, but lots of footage involving Sian Pattenden, who played the young Jane (and a lot of great background establishing her passionate personality!)...and much new material involving St. John, Diana and Mary!  I loved it!  They even included Rosamund Oliver, who was completely cut out of the 4 hour VHS version.  Thanks BBC for finally releasing this marvelous TV miniseries on DVD for us ""Eyre-heads.""

(If you can get a copy of it, I have a copy of it.)  At just under four hours long, it is the most accurate of any of the movies to the book.  It has everything, from Jane's return to Gateshead to see her ailing aunt to the gypsy scene.  Zelah Clarke portrays the best Jane: she is not too beautiful like many of the actresses who have attempted Jane are (i.e. Susannah York and Joan Fontaine). Timothy Dalton makes a wonderful Mr. Rochester: you can see his mind working as he schemes to make Jane love him.The only thing that bothers me about this version is how good looking Timothy Dalton is.  Edward Rochester is supposed to be fairly ugly, and as everyone knows, Timothy Dalton is incredibly handsome.  Even so, his marvelous acting ability still makes him the best there is.Caution to viewers:  Since this version is so long, there are many parts of it that are somewhat slow.

I like the lady who plays Bessie in this version and I really and truly thought she did justice to the character in this part.  I still prefer the Masterpiece Theatre version, sorry I just do.  There are things that I like in both though, the actor who plays St. John was exactly what I thought of when I read the book, he was handsome but stern at the same time.

So I ordered the DVD, and I am so glad I did. Since my VHS is several years old, the color on the DVD is so much sharper, even the sound is clearer. I love Jane Eyre. I've read the book a number of times. This production is the absolute best. I haven't seen all of the different productions, so I can't honestly compare it to many others. I've seen the one starring Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds. I've also seen the old 1970 version starring George C. Scott and Susannah York, which is an excellent version as well. Of course it's much easier to convey a story like Jane Eyre in five hours rather than two.In my humble opinion, there could have been no two better actors to play the lead roles. Timothy Dalton, while certainly too handsome to fit the description given Rochester in the book, gave a stellar performance in this. He conveyed every emotion the part called for, not only through his dialog, but also his body language and those deeply expressive eyes. Zelah Clarke was perfect, and I thought fit the description of Jane so well, although she is not a 'plain Jane.'I am so pleased that Alexander Baron, who wrote the dramatization, did not stray from the rich language of the time with all those memorable phrases (...I shall reflect upon the matter...I never meant to wound you thus...Jane, come hither...she is a singular person, Sir...). Yes, the story remains the same even with the language updated to a more comtemporary style, but keeping it authentic adds so much.This production is a gem, and one I will enjoy over and over again for years to come.

228636,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,6300248550,Matthew Kresal,"[4, 4]","After wanting to see this 1983 BBC production for some time, I've finally gotten to see this at last. Having never actually read the book I wasn't sure what I would make of the production, which had been recommended to me because of me being a fan of Timothy Dalton, who plays the role of Mister Edward Rochester. What I got was a fine production to say the least. It has a fine cast, fine production values which help to tell this atmospheric romance/drama in a fine fashion.The cast is fantastic to say the very least. Both Sian Pattenden (as the child) and Zelah Clarke (as the grown-up) both give fine performances in the title role of Jane Eyre, both are believable in their roles and come across as strong willed but all too human characters, which is especially true of Clarke as her relationship with her employer Mr. Rochester grows throughout the story. Speaking of Mr. Rochester, there is an absolutely brilliant performance by Timothy Dalton in the role. Dalton shows a huge range of emotions in the part and he shares some fine chemistry with Clarke and they really work well as a couple. There's also a fine supporting cast as well including Jean Harvey as Rochester's housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax, Damien Thomas as Rochester's mysterious friend Richard Mason, Judy Cornwell as Jane's aunt Mrs. Reed, Mary Tamm as Rochester's love interest Blanche Ingram plus Elaine Donnelly, Morag Hood and Andrew Bicknell as the Rivers family amongst others. Also of mention is the performance of Joolia Cappleman as Bertha who, while not often seen, has a considerable influence over the story and lends it much of its atmosphere and mystery. Together they make for a fine cast of actors and actresses.There's also some fine production values as well. It was shot on both film (for exterior scenes) and videotape (for interiors) which some people have used against it as a way of calling this a cheap looking production. Nothing could be farther then the truth, which is that this was standard BBC policy at the time and virtually all of the programs made by the BBC (such as the original TV series of Doctor Who for one of many examples) were shot that way. Besides one shouldn't judge the production based on that, in my opinion anyway. Instead it should be judged based on the costumes and sets used. Both of those categories are successes as the BBC was more then capable on making fantastic period sets and costumes. Both the interiors and the exterior scenes are well shot and lit, which help to evoke both the moodiness of the story and the atmosphere of the period as well as seen in any of the scenes (interior or exterior) at Thornfield Hall for example. There's also some fine make-up work as well, especially in episode eleven which should be seen as not to spoil the story for anyone. There is also the music of composer Paul Reade who produced a fine piece of music for the titles sequences and the sporadic, but well made and used, pieces heard throughout the production as well. Once one looks past how the production was shot (which shouldn't really even be and issue), there are plenty of things in the costumes, set, make-up and music to admire about this production.Last, but not least, is the script which was written by Alexander Baron from the novel by Charlotte Bront. Having never read the novel, I am unable to judge how faithful the script is to the original novel though, from what I've read from other reviews, the script adheres to the novel rather faithfully. Judging it then from the point of view of the writing alone it is a well constructed story which goes from Jane as a girl to her becoming the governess for Rochester's ward and beyond. There is a steady build-up of tension once Jane arrives as a mysterious laughter can be heard along with unexplained occurrences and Jane's growing feelings for Rochester.  Especially since it is told across eleven half-hour episodes which each ending, cliffhanger like, at a point that brings the viewer back to see what happens next (especially someone like me who hasn't read the novel). This may be down to the novel, I don't know,  but even if it is there is much credit to be given to  Baron for being able to bring it to this production.All in all this 1983 BBC production of Jane Eyre is a fine example of BBC costume drama.

I've seen countless reproductions of ""Jane Eyre"" on the screen and have always been somewhat disappointed in them: they either did not stay true to the story (granted, it is a long story!) or the character of Jane Eyre was overly pretty.I really enjoyed this mini-series!

She is calm and resourceful and as inviting as a calm meadow.

However, that is easily overlooked by his gruff and rude demeanor, and the way he manages to treat everyone cruelly - even Adelle.This production was filmed in the mid 1980's, and it does show. It is a video tape, so it has that quality of a soap opera, and not a modern movie. For me, personally, I like the aspect of sort of watching a stage production. I much more enjoy plays than movies, so I enjoyed that. Others might not.Some reviews bring up the idea there was no ""chemistry"" between Jane and Rochester. I got that from the book as well. My belief is that in movies today, so much is put on the screen there is little left to the imagination. Jane was quiet and demure and reserved - that was her upbringing.

Most things free-born would submit to anything for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant'.I have read an re-read Jane Eyre several times and every time the book manages to amaze me with lines like the above. It seems to me that Charlotte Bronte wrote about ideas and feelings easily transferred to the 21st century. Which would explain the popularity of the novel. And maybe that is the one characteristic that distinguishes great literature from everything else written: the timeless quality of the ideas and feelings.What I like about this 1983 adaptation of Jane Eyre is, that almost all of my favourite lines are there, keeping the best and the most romantic ones and deleting the more biblical references, which to a modern audience would be incomprehensible and dull anyway. The acting is superb and although I have read many reviews stating that Dalton might be too handsome and Clarke too old.. who cares? (The only weak spot in the acting might be the (French?) girl who plays Adele).Age and appearences do not matter so much anymore when something is acted so well that you are almost spellbound.I liked the theatrical feeling to this adaptation, no music played to disburb the beautifully written dialogues. This series depends on the suberb acting of the players and a well-written script. (BTW Bridewell is a London prison, which explains Dalton in chains when playing 'plain charades' in company, this part for me the only incomprehensible thing before I found out about Bridewell).The Dalton/Clarke version displays all the depth of the main characters and their wealth of feelings. The video is well worth your money.Every other Jane Eyre I have seen (and own) could not satisfy me, because the plotline was changed, it was poorly acted, important characters were deleted, the story moving too fast or the dialogue was written poorly and very incomprehensible. And most of the time it would be a combination of all things mentioned.

It is true that Timothy Dalton cannot in any way be called &#34;unhandsome&#34; and still less, &#34;hideous&#34; in spite of his injuries, which were very capably reproduced by makeup and prosthetics.  But it is his depth of emotion, and his classic voice and delivery, that makes him a believable Mr. Rochester.  When you see him sob as Jane leaves him it will tear your heart out.Unlike some other versions, St. John Rivers looks exactly like Jane describes him, and his portrayal embodies the character faithfully.

All three have their strengths and weaknesses, but this 1983 BBC version is by far the most accurate and true to detail. It's impossible to fit Charlotte Bront's imaginitive narration into a two-hour movie, a problem less acute in this four-hour mini-series.At first I was afraid Timothy Dalton as the tortured Edward Rochester would be too well-groomed for the part, but his experience as a Shakespearean performer makes up for any 007 biases I might have had. He brings out Rochester's dark, passionate nature with the necessary flair.Zelah Clarke is wonderful as Jane Eyre. She portrays Jane's inner conflicts and her upright yet passionate personality with the subtlety required for this difficult part. Of course Zelah doesn't look eighteen -- I believe she was twenty-six at the time of filming -- but she fits the part beautifully. It's a pity she disappeared from acting after this series.*** CAREFUL !!! SPOILERS !!! ***In the other JE versions, the last part of the novel, in which Jane flees Thornfield and -- unbeknown to her -- meets her cousins, is usually shortened to the point of embarrassment. In both the 1996 and 1997 version, the two Rivers sisters are merged into one person. In the 1996 version it's Mary, in the 1997 version it's Diana, whereby Jane's lawyer Briggs is merged into her cousin St. John in the latter rendition.Not so in the 1983 mini-series. Here we have the full account, with all its philosophical, social, and religious implications. As Jane escaped unrestrained passion and the loss of her integrity when she fled Thornfield, she escapes the abnegation of her heart and feelings when she flees a loveless marriage with St. John.For all fans of Charlotte Bront and Jane Eyre, this DVD is a MUST!",5,This rendition is the most true to Charlotte Bront's original classic,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,1913,"[""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', '1996', 'version', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'William', 'Hurt', '1997', 'version', 'Robert', 'Young', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'three', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', '1983', 'BBC', 'version', 'far', 'most', 'accurate', 'true', 'detail', 'impossible', 'fit', 'Charlotte', 'Bront', 'imaginitive', 'narration', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'problem', 'less', 'acute', 'four-hour', 'mini-series.At', 'first', 'was', 'afraid', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'tortured', 'Edward', 'Rochester', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'well-groomed', 'part', 'experience', 'Shakespearean', 'performer', 'up', '007', 'biases', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'out', 'Rochester', 'dark', 'passionate', 'nature', 'necessary', 'flair.Zelah', 'Clarke', 'wonderful', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Jane', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'upright', 'yet', 'passionate', 'personality', 'subtlety', 'required', 'difficult', 'part', 'course', 'Zelah', ""n't"", 'look', 'eighteen', 'believe', 'was', 'twenty-six', 'time', 'filming', 'part', 'beautifully', 'pity', 'disappeared', 'acting', 'series', '***', 'CAREFUL', 'SPOILERS', 'other', 'JE', 'versions', 'last', 'part', 'novel', 'Jane', 'flees', 'Thornfield', 'unbeknown', 'cousins', 'usually', 'shortened', 'point', 'embarrassment', '1996', '1997', 'version', 'two', 'Rivers', 'sisters', 'are', 'merged', 'one', 'person', '1996', 'version', 'Mary', '1997', 'version', 'Diana', 'whereby', 'Jane', 'lawyer', 'Briggs', 'merged', 'cousin', 'St.', 'John', 'latter', 'rendition.Not', 'so', '1983', 'mini-series', 'Here', 'have', 'full', 'account', 'philosophical', 'social', 'religious', 'implications', 'Jane', 'escaped', 'unrestrained', 'passion', 'loss', 'integrity', 'when', 'fled', 'Thornfield', 'abnegation', 'heart', 'feelings', 'when', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'St.', 'John.For', 'fans', 'Charlotte', 'Bront', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'DVD', 'MUST']",N/A

But with this one--if I wanted to pick the book up and read along with the movie I could do it quite easily, so faithful is this representation of the book.My only objection, and it really isn't even an objection, is that I wish it could have been just a LITTLE bit longer because some scenes near the end with Mary, Diana, and St. John seem rushed--but you can't have everything.

228656,A2W4UEAOFG5P4O,6300248550,puck,"[35, 36]","I watched the recent 2006 Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of Jane Eyre, with a nagging certainty, this wasn't the dark, complex tale I remembered from childhood.  So I revisited the book, which confirmed my suspicions.  Over the next few months people started buzzing about a 1983 adaptation which, among other things, was more faithful to the novel.I obtained a copy and as promised, it was more faithful to the novel . . . among other things.- For the pervasive dark tone, only the 1944 adaptation with George Barnes' exquisite black and white photography and lighting captures the mood VISUALLY, at least to me.  The necessary rewrites (this one's only 97 min.) are well crafted and tonally consistent. But the story is woefully incomplete and the acting may at times, seem a mite self conscious to the modern ear.- The 2006 (228 min) is visually lovely, but maybe TOO lovely, even sumptuous in places where understatement or stark ugliness would better serve. And Rochester has been so neutered, he's unrecognizable, if not out-and-out awkward.  The rewrites here range from prosaic to shamefully expository.  And the Gateshead-Lowood segment is so truncated, her grim childhood context barely registers.  To her credit, Ruth Wilson (Jane) makes the most of what she is given...but sorry, no cigar.One of the most defining elements in Charlotte Bront's story telling, is her language.  Her words not only tell us of feelings and events, but through sharp, deliberate dialog, also keenly shape her characters and by corollary, their relationships.  For this, only two adaptations are notable. Both by the BBC, done in '73, and '83.- 1973  (275 min) The plot and language here is faithful to the novel. But personally, I found the performances, too intellectualized to capture the passion and subtleties in the story. It's also rather wordy.  Like the '83, the '73  has comparatively low production values -- video interiors, film exteriors, bad lighting, unimaginative camera work. I realize for some folks, that's the deal breaker.  But if it's not, read on, because the similarities end there.- 1983  The more emotionally charged '83 adaptation (which clocks in at 5 hrs.18 min.), staring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton, not only beats out '73, but in my opinion, trumps all the others by deftly balancing all the story's components the best. Here Jane's bleak childhood is given it's weight. From her marginalized upbringing with her hateful aunt, Mrs. Reed, to her perilous life at Lowood Institution -- where beatings, humiliation, unfounded accusations and a relentless barrage of damning judgment, were administered on the regular.  Sean Pattenden as young Jane plays the more feisty, rebellious side of Jane's nature, than the sympathetic one, but she does a fine job.  Robert James as the sadistic Mr. Brocklehust is sensational.  And this may be the first time, Helen Burns is portrayed as more than just a abused, saintly martyr.  This Burns is also distant and alarmingly passive, which casts shadows on her rabid dogmatism.  Fully fleshing both these characters, allows the controversial ""Evangelism"" thread, enough presence, to smoothly carry over to her year at Moorhouse.  A thread that's usually obscured at best.Zelah Clarke as adult Jane is restrained, curious, appropriately guarded and willful.  Each time I view her performance I'm struck by how profoundly she listens.  And how subtly responsive she is.  Watch her look of shock and disgust as Rochester nearly hurls the portfolio of art work at her, then blames her for keeping Adele up too late. Initially some of this might be missed due to the shock of her costar's thunder.What can I say about Timothy Dalton that hasn't already been said? How about this...He is the Tony Soprano of Edward Rochesters.  Most times you can't tell if he's going to kill her, f*ck her, or shake her hand.  Which works spectacularly well.  Rochester is after all, about attraction/repulsion. He's the ultimate forbidden fruit.  Sure close ups reveal an unfairly handsome man,  but that's okay, because Dalton manages to capture Rochester's conflicting nature, with energy to spare...  balancing his magnetism, desperation, warmth, wit, playfulness, against his imposing stature, manipulation, sarcasm, brazen sexuality, ethical elasticity, and of course his taste for outrageous debauchery -- like a master juggler.  And apologizes for none of it.And he's sometimes flat out bratty.When *his* Rochester explains to Mrs Fairfax (Jean Harvey),  that Jane bewitched his horse, HE MEANS IT!  Which gives Harvey, (who's terrific), a wonderful fall-off-your-chair-in-disbelief moment, when she stammers out, ""s-sirrr!?.""Clarke and Dalton are never better than during the first crucial interviews.  When Rochester explains to Jane that, ""[he's] a trite, commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the petty dissipations of the rich and worthless.""... we don't doubt it.  His transitions are flawless.  Watch him turn away -- as he conceals from Jane, he's been studying her -- then slip into a trance, fixed on some distant point imperceptible to us, uttering what sounds like nonsense.  Lines that might easily land with a thud, move unselfconsciously over the man's tongue.  Here Edward also plays the corrective teacher, when he tells her, with certainty, ""[repentance] is not the cure...""  for what ails him.  This is probably the first time Jane's heard anyone say those words and it's a VERY IMPORTANT LINE. Through it all, Clarke 's Jane grapples intensely, turning her enigmatic boss's words over in her head. Opining only when asked, in a balance of poised candor, and soft, deep-seeded concern. And from here this relationship is off to a running start, developing from the point from which Bront intended. It is also here, we first appreciate the power of the author's language and an artist's ability to translate it.OTHER NOTABLE SCENES- About Adele (Jane's Smack-Down)  Jane verbally flogs her boss for his abhorrent behavior toward Adele, without breaking a sweat, while exuding moral superiority in the process. You go girl! This is also the first Rochester who actually seems to do something. I mean like work.  He even seems good at it. Dalton establishes this in one decisively delivered line at the end.- After The Fire:  Edward holds Jane's hand with an expression of profound warmth and gratitude, while pulling his panicked but entranced employee closer to him.  He needs her to stay with him tonight. He cannot justify overpowering her, but he enjoys knowing he can.  This scene superbly captures the duality in this character.  I think more artful camera work might have helped amplify Jane's POV.- The Gypsy Scene (Dalton In Drag)  He's mostly hilarious and solidly on the mark as he uses Bront's words to soothe, shock and ultimately manipulate Jane.  The scene shifts and Clarke is mesmorizing as she moves from impatience with the feeble fortune teller to near hypnotic fascination by her faint recognition of the words and their oddly insightful messenger.- After Richard's Departure: The louder he gets, the softer she becomes.  Rochester raptures on sardonically, about the virtues of Blanche.  In response, Jane softly says ""yes sir"" three times, hitting the line three different ways.  The third time, is in pained resignation and is barely audible.  They're both phenomenal here.-  Mrs. Reed's Deathbed: Clarke's spin on Jane's forgiveness of her aunt (Judy Cornwell)is a sharp departure from every other actress I've seen play this scene. Here there is a bite in Eyre's tone. Whatever forgiveness means to *this* Jane, it may not be so generous as to permit forgetting, nor rendering Mrs. Reed free from Eyre's own judgment and disgust. What's important is she's now free of any damage Mrs Reed may have inflicted. To me, this interpretation is closest to the Jane in the novel. And Cornwell is superb, as she hisses out her last words of condemnation at her ""tormenter.""- The Proposal: Notable mainly because, Dalton is the only Rochester who really seems to know how to kiss his girl. And his rambling justification about atonement is chilling and exquisite. Otherwise the scene clearly needed reworking and is one of the few instances where you can see the effects of a tight budget and scheduling intrude.-  The Tell-Tale-Torn-Veil: In this explosive scene, Dalton and Clarke lock horns over Grace's continued presence at Thornfield. This helps make the absurd Grace Poole story line a touch more palatable (Carol Gillies as Grace delivers some rare moments).- Aftermath Of The-Wedding-That-Wasn't: Perhaps the most sensual scene EVER.  Jane leaves her room, stumbles, Edward catches her, securing her on his lap, and starts talking softly into her neck in a deep, throaty voice.  Jane is palpably exhausted, disheartened, depleted.  Sexy and poignant, what more can you ask for.Unfortunately some of the scene that follows tips into melodrama, even after a good start, (which is rare here). I think this is likely due  to time constraints and/or directorial assy-ness.  Still there are some great moments to be had. Clarke, who's nearly despondent, fully captures a woman brutally injured, by a mighty blow to the heart.- Moorhouse: Andrew Bicknell hits a home run as St. John Rivers.  He embodies the icy, remote man, whose kind acts are more motivated by securing his box seat in the kingdom of heaven, than his full capacity to feel on earth.  ""You are ... forgive the word . . . impassioned,""  he warns Jane, with the hesitancy of telling someone they have a boil on their chin.- Return To Thornfield: Many great moments here, from his tearful discovery that his wayward faery has returned, to Janes teasing him into a fury.I could quibble that this or that, might have been tweaked (The occasional scoring is bad and it runs in half hour segments which is annoying. A few scenes needed to be reworked, but only a few). But with 90% plus of remarkable drama, at likely the lowest budget per hour... ""quibble"" don't amount to a hill of beans. And you know the director Julien Aymes deserves a lot of the credit for that. And Alexander Baron who wrote the dramatization, also did a bang up job.",5,GUTSY AND ON THE MARK,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,10184,"['watched', 'recent', '2006', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre',

I had seen all the previous productions, but they don't come close to the emotional depth this one evokes, including the newest version of a year or so back.

228661,A2CYIPB6ZSV52J,6300248550,Rosie Cotton,"[511, 518]","A few months ago I watched both this 4-hour BBC production and the more recent A&E; version starring Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton in one sitting ... an Eyre-athon! And in my opinion, this version EASILY won hands-down as the best (I've already seen just about every other filmed version). I've since watched it many times and never tire of it. If you love the novel, what a glorious, breathtaking treat this is!!Yes, this production is long (good news for Bronte fans!) and it has a somewhat dated feel, but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you won't want to watch any other version!Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester... it's that simple. I don't care that other reviewers claim he's too handsome. Dalton is attractive, certainly, but no pretty-boy. In fact he possesses a craggy, angular dark charm that, to my mind, is quite in keeping with the mysterious, very masculine Mr R. And he takes on Rochester's sad, tortured persona so poignantly. He portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it, but also displays Rochester's tender, passionate, emotional side as well. (IMO the A&E; production suffers in that Ciaran Hinds - whom I normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout. I've read the book many times and I never felt that Rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast!)Whenever I reread the novel, I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane. Ms. Clarke, to me, resembles Jane as she describes herself (and is described by others). Small, childlike, fairy... though it's true the actress doesn't look 18, she portrays Jane's attributes so well. While other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional, one must remember that the character spent 8 years at Lowood being trained to hold her emotions and ""passionate nature"" in check. Her main inspiration was her childhood friend Helen, who was the picture of demure submission. Although her true nature was dissimilar, Jane learned to master her temper and appear docile, in keeping with the school's aims for its charity students who would go into 'service'. Jane became a governess in the household of the rich Mr. Rochester. She would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal (as Samantha Morton does in the A&E; version). Even later on when she gave as well as she got, she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer. Nevertheless, if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles Zelah-as-Jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-tempered.The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is just right, I think. No, it does not in the least resemble Hollywood (thank God! It's not a Hollywood sort of book) but theirs is a romance which is true, devoted and loyal. And for a woman like Jane, who never presumed to have *any* love come her way, it is a minor miracle.The rest of the casting is terrific, and I love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here. So, too, is much of the rich, evocative dialogue. This version is the only one that I know of to include the lovely, infamous 'gypsy scene' and in general, features more humor than other versions I've seen. In particular, the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful!Jane Eyre was, in many ways, one of the first novelized feminists. She finally accepted love on her own terms and independently, and, at last, as Rochester's true equal. Just beautiful!Now, WHEN WILL THIS BE RELEASED ON DVD?EDIT: This has just been mastered and released on DVD in its original unedited format, which means a whole extra hour of footage... it's now 5 hours instead of 4, woot woot!

If your tastes are so shallow that you simply MUST have glitzy bells and whistles over substance, then I guess you can't watch any TV production made before 1990.  Yes, the BBC at the time had very few resources to work with -- that still makes the original FORSYTE SAGA (late 60s) absorbing entertainment for those whose imaginations are broader and deeper than those who require special effects and fancy hi-tech wizardry in their entertainment.  I guess these people can never watch theater where audiences are forced to use their imaginations far more than TV/film audiences are.This production of JANE EYRE is the most richly satisfying of all.  Timothy Dalton simply IS Rochester, even tho he is too handsome for the character.  Zelah Clarke is little and plain just as the character is described in the novel.  Both deliver Bronte's language beautifully and naturally.  So much of the novel appears in this production, I think Charlotte Bronte herself would recognize her voice here.  The only thing missing is Bronte's focus on Jane's relationship to God--that is minimized here.  There is some superb acting and when it all finally ends, you wish it would just go on.

Poza,"[10, 10]","Watching this miniseries, I couldn't help be struck by how these 19th century characters behaved in a more realistic fashion than a lot of the modern characters in current movies. While they are bound by social rules and live in circumstances far removed from those of our present society, they react to those circumstances in a credible way.Since I'm not a great fan of Bronte novels, I attribute my reaction to how well-acted and written this miniseries is. Given the type of dialog, it's a tribute to Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke's acting. They deliver their lines, lines that could easily sound phony or affected, from the heart.There are only a few small problems with this miniseries but they do not detract in any measurable way from the viewers' enjoyment. First, there is fluctuation between video (for interior scenes) and film (for outside scenes) which can be a bit disconcerting, particularly when you're immersed in the story and not really thinking about the fact that you're watching T.V. Second, Timothy Dalton really is too attractive to be Rochester. This isn't an especially great problem except for a scene where Rochester asks Jane if she finds him handsome and she immediately answers ""no"". This makes Jane seem insincere or ridiculously modest when this is certainly not what is meant. Had they cut that line, Dalton's attractiveness wouldn't be an issue. He certainly was well cast for his acting ability. He is superb as Rochester, and I say that as someone who isn't especially a fan of his.If you're a fan of this type of genre, you can't help but be thoroughly pleased by this version.

Although this version is now dated, the producers undid themselves and did the book (still one of my favourites) justice. I recognized much of the novel's dialogue and the actors truly brought the characters to life. Before the handsome Timothy Dalton would take up the role of James Bond, he effortlessly and convincingly played the enigmatic Mr. Rochester in a way, which I believe, Ms. Bronte would have wanted when she imagined this profound, unhappy and wounded man. The same can be said of Zalah Clake's portrayal of Jane. I cannot begin to say how fitting she was. This was truly a role she was born to play. She was THE PERFECT choice. Her body, her face, the way she spoke. Everything! My only regret is that after this her acting career more or less halted.If you want to see Jane Eyre, I recommend this mini series.

228677,A1MUP3BTU5XSAL,6300248550,Spider Wood,"[10, 19]","When the screenwriters adapted Robert Stevenson's ""Jane Eyre,"" they had to leave everything out that couldn't be condensed.  The mini-series approach, however, allows ample time to study the characters in depth. In my 29 years, I recall not one, but *two* BBC TV mini-series adaptations of Jane Eyre that played in the early 1980s.  These attempted to portray the book as a complete experience.  I won't judge which of the two is more definitive, having only read part of the book.The 1983 one, released to VHS/DVD, starred Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Some reviewers have commented on how well Sian Pattenden portrays young Jane, mistreated by her aunt Reed's family and at Lowood school. This is the first hour of the series, and I was riveted. When Jane is grown and Rochester arrives, Clarke and Dalton do the work justice - they're just not as much fun to watch as their counterparts in the 1973 mini-series.The 1973 series starred Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack. The series is excellent, almost to the point where I'd call it treachery that it's not available either on VHS or DVD. This was no minor production: in fact, it played in the States on PBS up to ten years after its original broadcast.Dalton's Rochester seemed at times too leaden and serious, almost a caricature. It's probably not necessary to blow this aspect of Rochester out of proportion. Jayston plays Rochester as a bitter man with a secret thorn in his side, but balances sardonic wit with what's been called a ""poetic imagination."" Check this out when Rochester is explaining his secret to Jane. You may find Jayston on record as saying that Rochester was his favorite television role. His enthusiasm for the part is obvious. Clarke's Jane is plain, and seeks independence, love and servitude, but it's a little harder to see where the fire in Jane Eyre comes from. It's not so much Clarke was a bit too good-looking, although that may be. Cusack, an Irish actress, is irresistable in more ways than one.  A governess who must mind her boundaries as a subordinate, she converses on would-be equal terms with Rochester, trading jabs, despite the difference in age and experience.  Thus, in the early scenes, we get a good sense of Jane Eyre's spiritedness (even though we might not have seen the part about her childhood). The interaction of Dalton and Clarke, while fine, falls short of some of these bonus characteristics.Other things to note: the first episode of the 5-part 1973 series was seldom shown outside of the UK.  The memorable theme music was the passionate ""Introduction and Allegro"" composed by one of Britain's greatest, Sir Edward Elgar.  My approbation goes to the director Joan Craft, the screenwriter, Robin Chapman, and to the cast:  Megs Jenkins (Mrs. Fairfax), Stephanie Beacham (Blanche Ingram), Geoffrey Whitehead (St. John Rivers), Susan Brodrick (Mary Rivers), Caroline Harris (Diana Rivers), Edward De Souza (Richard Mason), and the rest.It's unfortunate that few people will have the opportunity to see both series to compare them. ""Jane Eyre"" is a classic novel. Many different adaptations of it are currently for sale. In fact, it appears some extremely poor adaptations of it are for sale, now. Even uncharitable people must acknowledge the 1973 version of ""Jane Eyre"" is not ""bad,"" and had a good run before the BBC decided to produce a new series for 1983.If you write to the powers-that-be, BBC America or BBC Worldwide, they'd be able to estimate the market potential of a video release. Go ahead and give it a try.

228678,A1NJRDUD0DF4Y,6300248550,Steven C. Millhorn,"[2, 4]","In describing my thoughts and feelings for the movies Jane Eyre and Middlemarch, it's like telling someone of an old friend. I love to watch these movies over and over again, just to get the raw education and great historical lessons from the land of my ancestry. In Jane Eyre, you have Mr. Rodchester slinging out so many ten dollar words that are not so commonly used in our American discourse, that you feel like you've just been to college and your among the elite in society. You also have the typical themes of the Rich verses Poor, and unprincipaled verses the godly and chaste. But what I like most about Jane Eyre beside the education, was how that one line spoken by Mr. Rodchester seemed to sum up what happened, and what would eventually turn to his good. He said: ""fate has out maneuvered me or providence checked me"" and to that the minister said Amen! Mr. Rodchester's fate of trying to force a marriage with a godly sweet angel before it's time, was rewarded at the end of the show by the Providence of God. God allowed him to be judged by fire, but then answered his hopes and prayers by letting the whisp of his anguish travel over the air, hundreds of miles to the awaiting ears of his true love. And with Jane about to enter into a marriage with a steely cleric with no heart of love for her, she received the message on the wind from God and from Mr. Rodchester just in the nick of time, and she fled to her fulfillment. I highly recommend Jane Eyre for viewing over and over again, it's an education and a heart throbbing love story all wrapped up into one. Now as far as the history lesson of MiddleMarch is concerned, time and space will not allow enough to be said about this show. It was not your typical English film, this is a series of many plots and sub plots, which show the true nature and character of a growing nation. A snippet out of time, a viewing of the developing countryside society of England's heart land. Once again though, the English protray the villian as a clergyman, and the so called good clergyman, was a pool playing, card playing, pub attendee. But the other plots of love and of riches carries well, and one wishes that Dr. Lidgate would have married Dorothea.

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[4, 8]","As a big fan of the Bronte sisters I had always heard this described as the ""definitive"" Jane Eyre so I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy.  Though I do like that so much of the dialogue is taken right from the book and the plot line stays faithful to what Charlotte wrote, Timothy Dalton is just wrong as Rochester.  He is far too young and handsome in this version and the fact that they paired him with an actress who is perhaps too old and even plainer than needed for the role compounds the problem.  I wish they would have allowed  Jane to blossom from Rochester's love into a little bit of a beauty during the courtship scenes yet she remains about the same.  Actually Jane and Rochester's love just does not seem realistic at all and at times Dalton's Rochester seems more nuts than simply passionate and intense and I can see why Jane ran away from him when she found out about the ""mad woman in the attic"".
