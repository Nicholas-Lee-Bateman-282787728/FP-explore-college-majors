764483,A1T5MVB4Z1SLJ7,B0000ALPFF,Floweringplum,"[0, 0]","When I first saw this movie I enjoyed it enough to want to include it into my limited library of other movies.  The development of a relationship between three adults maybe difficult for some to want to view but this relationship was because of circumstances that were what life brings to people who are not always working in the direction of respect and responsibility.I admired and sympathized with the need to keep a family together and trying to work against the tide of reality.  The reality being that the husband is immature, self centered, and has a on going gambling problem that leads to lies, loss of much needed monies, and promises that will not be fulfilled.  The actor who plays the part of the husband does a fine job in conveying to the audience his negatives and the circumstances of life that makes changes in his characters attitude.Judith LIght is very good and her performance brings to life a women who is willing to work hard for her family and who wants to meet her own need to move forward.  Unfortunately, she doesn't want to accept soon enough that her energizes are being wasted.  The husband and wife both have issues with seeing things as they are and nipping the problems in the bud.Judith LIght's character shows the struggles financially and emotionally to the family and how they are impacted.  The changes that will eventually become her new life and the introduction of another man who is far more supportive of her, the goals of financial success, and bringing happiness into her life become a driving force to get out of the life that she has lived with for so long.  The relationship with the boyfriend is slowly developed and is not gone into overnight.The college age children in this movie come and go in the film,  but their feelings of confusion, hurt, anger are made clear and are not resolved even at the end of the movie.  The children are not seen accepting the dynamics of three.Another viewer considered this movie to be sub par.  Not if you are looking for a movie that moves along, tells a story that is more real than fiction and has good acting.  A chick flick maybe but a very good one!",4,Life's Circumstances,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,2142,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'want', 'include', 'limited', 'library', 'other', 'movies', 'development', 'relationship', 'three', 'adults', 'maybe', 'difficult', 'want', 'view', 'relationship', 'was', 'circumstances', 'were', 'what', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'working', 'direction', 'respect', 'responsibility.I', 'admired', 'sympathized', 'need', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'trying', 'work', 'tide', 'reality', 'reality', 'being', 'husband', 'immature', 'centered', 'going', 'gambling', 'problem', 'lies', 'loss', 'much', 'needed', 'monies', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'actor', 'who', 'part', 'husband', 'fine', 'job', 'conveying', 'audience', 'negatives', 'circumstances', 'life', 'changes', 'characters', 'attitude.Judith', 'LIght', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'life', 'women', 'who', 'willing', 'work', 'hard', 'family', 'who', 'meet', 'own', 'need', 'move', 'forward', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'want', 'accept', 'soon', 'enough', 'energizes', 'are', 'being', 'wasted', 'husband', 'wife', 'have', 'issues', 'seeing', 'things', 'are', 'nipping', 'problems', 'bud.Judith', 'LIght', 'character', 'struggles', 'financially', 'emotionally', 'family', 'how', 'are', 'impacted', 'changes', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'new', 'life', 'introduction', 'man', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'supportive', 'goals', 'financial', 'success', 'bringing', 'happiness', 'life', 'become', 'driving', 'force', 'get', 'life', 'lived', 'so', 'long', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'slowly', 'developed', 'not', 'gone', 'overnight.The', 'college', 'age', 'children', 'movie', 'come', 'go', 'film', 'feelings', 'confusion', 'hurt', 'anger', 'are', 'made', 'clear', 'are', 'not', 'resolved', 'even', 'end', 'movie', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'seen', 'accepting', 'dynamics', 'three.Another', 'viewer', 'considered', 'movie', 'be', 'sub', 'par', 'Not', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'along', 'story', 'more', 'real', 'fiction', 'good', 'acting', 'chick', 'flick', 'maybe', 'very', 'good', 'one']",A Strange Affair
