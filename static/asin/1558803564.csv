He leaves me with the impression that life for a 13-year old boy in 1937 wasn't any less exciting or troublesome as life for a 13-year old boy in 2002.

A fairly large Jewish family live together, and each member has his or her own story to tell. Eugene (Jonathan Silverman) is the main character, a high school boy who dreams of playing pro baseball and seeing a naked woman. Stanley (Brian Drillinger) is his older brother, who dreams of escape, and does so by joining the army. Other members tell their dreams and shortfallings, too. Thus the picture adds up to a lot of little vignettes. Simon has been funnier elsewhere; his aim here seems more directed at sentimentality and nostalgia.

Otherwise this has to be the best Neil Simon work I have ever seen.  Although I am from a much newer generation, I could identify easily with many of the characters, both from similar personal experiences, and from the culture within which I was raised.  I would highly recommend this film, but only to true drama fans (of any age) and to older generations who have lived the times portrayed in this delightful romp.  There is mild adult content, so be wary if you allow your young teens to watch.  This is one of those rare classics that never received the publicity it deserved on the big screen; but then it can only appeal to a certain audience.

178235,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,1558803564,Genevieve Hayes,"[0, 0]","""Brighton Beach Memoirs"", the first of Neil Simon's three autobiographical plays (the other two being ""Biloxi Blues"" and ""Broadway Bound""), sees Simon's alter-ego, Eugene Jerome (Jonathon Silverman) coming of age in 1930's Brooklyn as his family struggles to make ends meet, while worrying about what the imminent war will mean for their relatives in Poland.Of the two film versions of Simon's autobiographical plays that I have seen, I think ""Biloxi Blues"" is the better play/film. In ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"", Jerome serves largely as an observer of the action that is going on around him, not a participant, and as a result, it makes it difficult to identify or sympathize with him. This is a problem that I didn't find in ""Biloxi Blues"", where Jerome plays a more active role in the story (I think this is largely due to Jerome's age in each of these plays). Also, ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" has a certain staginess to it - not so much in the location (the action does move around a lot), but more in the way the actors behave and deliver their lines.Nevertheless, I did enjoy ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" very much. I have liked Neil Simon's work since I was five and this film didn't disappoint. It is a very funny film and the acting is excellent. Watch this, and see ""Biloxi Blues"".

It takes us back to the times when earning a living was hard and in this case even harder for the Jerome family because a sister-in-law and her two daughters lived with the Jeromes because she was a widow. The antics of Eugene, the younger Jermone son, are comical. The father works at a job cutting out raincoats and selling party favors. Then he loses both jobs and depends on the older brother Stanley to help out but Stanley has lost his job until he makes a written apology to his boss. Then the father has a heart attack but survives. The mother is constantly sending Eugene to the store for small purchases such as one stick of butter or one pound of sugar. Eugene makes his funny comments which could be considered backtalk but it's done in a funny way. The older son repairs the radio so the dad can listen to the news because he is fearful of his relatives making it out of Poland safely. In the end a lot of the problems are worked out and everyone is happy because the relatives are coming to New York and they start making plans about where everyone will sleep.

He is hitting the puberty and can't control thinking of it.  His goal in life is to be the first Jewish pitcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers.But his mother (Blythe Danner) has other ideas for his future.  His mother runs the house with an iron fist and guilt.  His father (Bob Dishy) is working two jobs just to make ends meet.  His older bother  Stanley, has just lost his job for talking back to his boss.Also living with the Jerome's is Blanche's invalid sister (Judith Ivey) and her two daughters.  The older one Eugene has more than a passing crush on.The main theme of this film is too many people living in too little room with too little money.  In the end all conflicts arise from this.This is Neil Simon at his most personal.  The only problem is bad casting in the lead.  Jonathan Silverman never captures Eugene's spirit.  He just seems to be saying the lines and doesn't seem to understand what he is saying.  Matthew Broderick created the role in Los Angeles and then Broadway and won a Tony Award.  Silverman just doesn't have the comic timing to pull this difficult role off.On the other side, Blythe Danner shines as Eugene's mother Blanche.  Without having to tell the audience her problems, she makes them clear with her delivery.  Judith Ivey, in an early role, shows the frailty of Blanche's sister.This is a very good film and is good background for the excellent second installment Biloxi Blues.

178256,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,1558803564,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","If you're a fan of Neil Simon's then ""Brighton Beach Memoirs""(1986) is a must-see. This is a well-made movie with an amazing ensemble cast and witty dialogue that had me laughing out loud. Eugene (Jonathan Silverman), a Jewish teenager, narrates the story of his time as an adolescent, growing up amidst a close-knit Jewish family in 1930s Brooklyn, comprising dad, Jack (Bob Dishy), mom Kate (Blythe Danner), brother Stanley (Brian Dillinger), widowed aunt Blanche (Judith Ivey), and cousins Nora (Lisa Waltz) and Laurie (Stacey Glick). Eugene's dad is a hardworking man who tries to manage the family on his meager income, supplemented by the wages of his older son Stanley who works for a haberdasher/slave driver Mr. Stroheim (Steven Hill). The performances of the ensemble cast, especially the comical antics of the lead performer (Silverman) coupled with the creative dialogue make this an immensely entertaining watch. I loved the way family dynamics were explored in this movie - how Eugene feels like he is being victimized and bullied (being constantly sent to the store by his mother complaining,""I'm always going to the store. When I grow up, that's all I'll be trained to do, go to the store""), how the role of males and females were still very traditional (the women stayed home, whilst the men went out to work), and the close bond between members of this family (Eugene's mom takes in her widowed sister and two daughters even though Jack is a low wage-earner).The most comical aspects are scenes where the adolescent with raging hormones, as portrayed by Eugene, fantasizes about girls and sex. Upon glimpsing his first picture of a naked woman (a French woman at that), Eugene exults: ""I have seen the Golden Palace Of The Himalayas. Puberty is OVER! Onward and upward!"" Balanced against these comic moments are more somber ones such as when Eugene's 16-year-old cousin Nora decides to forge her own path in life or when Eugene's older brother Stanley has to deal with the repercussions of wrong choices.  With its cast of eccentric characters, the irreverent writing and amazing acting, this is a heartwarming, funny and poignant movie.
