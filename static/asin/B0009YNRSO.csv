916875,A7SQXASFDQ3N1,B0009YNRSO,F. R. Nickles Jr.,"[1, 1]","There are some great shows in this set - but for the money I was very disappointed.  First of all, there wasn't really good organization to it, and there was way too much ""Talk"", several shows appeared several times, and some of the shows that I was really hoping to see which I bought the set for weren't even on the DVD - so I felt that I wasted my money.  There were, however several really good episodes on here.  I think for the money they could have done a much better job and given people a lot more material.  To be honest, there are only a few shows which are really good on here, and the rest aren't really that good.  The ones that are good are very good - and I'm glad that I got to see them, but overall, I felt disappointed, because I spent a lot of money for this and I didn't feel that I got what I paid for.  Several of these had the same gags repeated in different situations several times, so there is a lot of repetition.  Some of the same shows appear 2-3-4 times.  The thing is, that they could have put a lot more shows on the same number of cds - rather than repeating themselves several times.  They could have done a much better job of presenting and organizing this material.",2,I was disappointed,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,1202,"['are', 'great', 'shows', 'set', 'money', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'First', 'all', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'organization', 'there', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Talk', 'several', 'shows', 'appeared', 'several', 'times', 'shows', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'see', 'bought', 'set', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'DVD', 'so', 'felt', 'wasted', 'money', 'were', 'however', 'several', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', 'here', 'think', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'given', 'people', 'lot', 'more', 'material', 'be', 'honest', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'shows', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'here', 'rest', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'ones', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'very', 'good', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'see', 'overall', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'spent', 'lot', 'money', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'got', 'what', 'paid', 'Several', 'had', 'same', 'gags', 'repeated', 'different', 'situations', 'several', 'times', 'lot', 'repetition', 'same', 'shows', 'appear', '2-3-4', 'times', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'lot', 'more', 'shows', 'same', 'number', 'cds', 'rather', 'repeating', 'several', 'times', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'presenting', 'organizing', 'material']",Candid Camera: 5 Decades of Smiles

Releasing just the best parts certainly wouldn't fit 10 discs.The anniversary specials do duplicate parts of other episodes, but they are an extra feature, not the main selling point.A better ballance between classic episodes and modern ones (i.e., more classics) would have been appreciated though.

It seems on the surface you are in for hours and hours of entertainment.  However, once you discover the ""dirty little secret"" you realize you've been had.  That ""secret"" is that throughout the DVDs in this set you will view the exact same footage of the same stunts/gags over and over again.  Some stunts are repeated four, even five times over the course of viewing.  Many of your favorite segments from the best era of Candid Camera, the 1960's, are included however there are many more that are not in this set.  Trust me; you will be very disappointed with the overall content in this collection.

916880,A3BD8STGDN1RT8,B0009YNRSO,"Selqet ""Silky""","[5, 16]","If you're a social science instructor of a certain age, you might remember that Phil Zimbardo of the important Stanford Prison experiments and other significant social psychology research was an early consultant to this show.  Since VHS gave way to DVD I've been hoping to replace my long-since worn out tape of the early shows, I used to use in classes to demonstrate the power of consensus.  I would present Asch's research, that demonstrated how most people would agree with others (on the length of a line) even if they majority was obviously wrong, just to be like everyone else.  In the early seasons of Candid Camera, they took advantage of this and related social patterns quite a bit.  They would have a bunch of actors in an office elevator all turn sideways at the same time, and the unsuspecting average person would do the same thing.  They would have a sign in a busy downtown area saying ""begin walking backwards now"" and have a bunch of variously dressed actors begin walking backwards, and many average people would do the same ridiculous thing to be like everyone else.  Perfect footage to humorously illustrate some fundamental observations of socialization, social interaction, and so forth.  Well, pretty much none of those episodes are in this collection. I don't get what the criteria were for selecting these ""best of"" episodes, but what's left are for the most part not useful for a social science classroom, with the possible exception of the interesting censored visit to the USSR.  The original episode didn't air because it was a threat to national security since it showed that the people of Communist Moscow were, well, people like us in many ways.  If you're teaching a history or poli-sci class on the Cold War era this one episode might be of use.  For the most part, this best of collection is a disappointment in terms of academic use.",3,Special review for social science instructors,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1871,"[""'re"", 'social', 'science', 'instructor', 'certain', 'age', 'might', 'remember', 'Phil', 'Zimbardo', 'important', 'Stanford', 'Prison', 'experiments', 'other', 'significant', 'social', 'psychology', 'research', 'was', 'early', 'consultant', 'show', 'VHS', 'gave', 'way', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hoping', 'replace', 'long-since', 'worn', 'out', 'tape', 'early', 'shows', 'used', 'use', 'classes', 'demonstrate', 'power', 'consensus', 'would', 'present', 'Asch', 'research', 'demonstrated', 'how', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'agree', 'others', 'length', 'line', 'even', 'majority', 'was', 'obviously', 'wrong', 'just', 'be', 'everyone', 'else', 'early', 'seasons', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'took', 'advantage', 'related', 'social', 'patterns', 'quite', 'bit', 'would', 'have', 'bunch', 'actors', 'office', 'elevator', 'turn', 'sideways', 'same', 'time', 'unsuspecting', 'average', 'person', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'sign', 'busy', 'downtown', 'area', 'saying', 'begin', 'walking', 'backwards', 'now', 'have', 'bunch', 'variously', 'dressed', 'actors', 'begin', 'walking', 'backwards', 'many', 'average', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'ridiculous', 'thing', 'be', 'everyone', 'else', 'Perfect', 'footage', 'humorously', 'illustrate', 'fundamental', 'observations', 'socialization', 'social', 'interaction', 'so', 'forth', 'Well', 'pretty', 'much', 'none', 'episodes', 'are', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'criteria', 'were', 'selecting', 'best', 'episodes', 'what', 'left', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'useful', 'social', 'science', 'classroom', 'possible', 'exception', 'interesting', 'censored', 'visit', 'USSR', 'original', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'air', 'was', 'threat', 'national', 'security', 'showed', 'people', 'Communist', 'Moscow', 'were', 'well', 'people', 'many', 'ways', ""'re"", 'teaching', 'history', 'poli-sci', 'class', 'Cold', 'War', 'era', 'one', 'episode', 'might', 'be', 'use', 'most', 'part', 'best', 'collection', 'disappointment', 'terms', 'academic', 'use']",Candid Camera: 5 Decades of Smiles
