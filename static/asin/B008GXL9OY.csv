He calls the cops while the janitor tells them why he is covered in blood. He reminds of a hillbilly version of Bruce Campbell. Anyways, the cop shows up & they go to the school to investigate his claims. It's a fast paced, moving story that looks straight from the 80's. The ending had me surprised but it was smart & something i've not seen before.Overall, if you love horror comedies, then you'll like this. It's fast paced, funny, & gory. I watched this right after the great film, The Sleeper, & the two go good together. Both films should be watched back to back.",4,A Cadaver Christmas,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,672,"['blood', 'soaked', 'janitor', 'walks', 'bar', 'clean', 'up', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'only', 'two', 'patrons', 'bar', 'cops', 'janitor', 'why', 'covered', 'blood', 'hillbilly', 'version', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Anyways', 'cop', 'up', 'go', 'school', 'investigate', 'claims', 'fast', 'paced', 'moving', 'story', 'straight', '80', 'ending', 'had', 'surprised', 'was', 'smart', 'something', 'i', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'before.Overall', 'love', 'horror', 'comedies', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'fast', 'paced', 'funny', 'gory', 'watched', 'right', 'great', 'film', 'Sleeper', 'two', 'go', 'good', 'together', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'back', 'back']",A Cadaver Christmas

1552963,AUF6QEATEZDTJ,B008GXL9OY,"jack ""mr. torrance""","[0, 2]","This movie commits the ultimate cinematic sin.IT'S BORING.Okay. first off, i love independent, painfully low budgeted horror films. I wanted to like this movie. trust me, i can tell that the film makers put incredible effort to make this movie and it shows.Horror comedy a la evil dead 2, which is obvious after watching the scene where the janitor gears up for the zombie fight, but he's no Bruce Campbell. Cool, i get it. Heres the problem, theres not one likable character in this entire movie and the best part of enjoying any movie is to cheer for the good guys and hope they live. In this movie, I was cheering for the rarely seen ""cadavers"".  Also, this movie wasn't funny, just annoying. There was nothing to hold my interest, and when theres a scene where the cadaver has the broken end of a plunger forced through its head and its obvious that the actor doing the so called forcing is  holding the plunger behind the cadavers head to make it look lie it has gone through it, then thats when i get bored. Worst off was the script, especially the dialogue,(nobody talks like that), Like i said, i love bad movies,(Plan 9 from outer space? LOVE IT!!! ) But the final and deadliest problem with this film is that the characters were so annoying I couldn't wait for them to die. Its rare that I want to turn a movie off 20 minutes into it, but this was one of those times, even though i forced myself to sit thru it,(i didn't want to waste the money.)

I mean, a Christmas time zombie holocaust sounds like it should make a great movie. I found this movie to be too slow. The zombie effects were bad, even by low budget standards. The acting was okay considering it is a B movie, and all the actors were likeable enough. This movie just seemed to be missing something and I can't quite put my finger on it. It ended up being kind of boring and forgettable.I will say that the cover art for this movie is amazing and really drew me in to purchase this item. I was tempted to keep it on my shelf for that reason alone, but I ultimately decided to give this one to my brother (a bigger zombie buff than I am).

That aside, the writer concentrated on telling one story. This is a story that has a beginning middle and ending, with all the loose endings tied neatly up for the audience,  Multiple plot lines is the downfall of many a monster movie that have the potential to be really good.Also, the actors had a good time and tossed in a few one-liners that are priceless.
