I was really happy with the length of the movies not to long but just the right amount of time to get the point across. Plus, the animation was quit well. My kids have learned quit a bit from this DVD God's word and I couldn't be happier. I know personally this DVD is a much better teacher then I could be. I am sure my future little ones will love this just as much as my two little ones I have right now.",5,A Movie To Watch,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,543,"['mom', 'two', 'little', 'ones', 'finding', 'movies', 'offer', 'really', 'cute', 'story', 'line', 'teachings', 'God', 'really', 'important', 'was', 'really', 'happy', 'length', 'movies', 'not', 'long', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'time', 'get', 'point', 'animation', 'was', 'quit', 'well', 'kids', 'have', 'learned', 'quit', 'bit', 'DVD', 'God', 'word', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'know', 'personally', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'teacher', 'then', 'could', 'be', 'am', 'sure', 'future', 'little', 'ones', 'will', 'love', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'two', 'little', 'ones', 'have', 'right', 'now']",Theo: God's Love

My children, ages 10, 7, & 3 especially loved watching the funny antics of Belfry and Luther - the 2 mice.  It is difficult to find good videos and teaching tools for children that teach about God and the Bible while also entertaining at the same time.  I was pleased to see scriptures quoted throughout the segments, as well as snippets of hymns in the background.  A unique way to acclimate young ones to traditional hymns and sneak in some wonderful scripture while they are entertained by the adorable mice and Bible stories.The animation is exceptionally well done.  The stories are short and cute.  The kids were entertained, and I was even interested in watching the whole episode with them.I highly recommend checking out this new DVD series!

1457046,A8N3FYDA2VUYY,B005ETZEPI,"Pirate2240 ""Kat""","[6, 6]","A new animated series, Theo, teaches and guide children and adults through Biblical theology. Theo is an elderly gentleman (who my youngest told me reminded her of Belle's father, from Beauty and the Beast), who discusses the doctrines of what sin is, God's character, The Bible, salvation and godly-living with easy-to-understand illustrations that make children want to learn more about the Christian faith.Theo's messages are well animated and accompanied by two mice, Belfry and Luther, who have a way of keeping it interesting in their quest for cookies that Theo makes. This DVD comes with two animated shorts:1. Saving FaithDid you know that the same type of faith that saved Abraham, saves you and me? Kids will be entranced by Theo, a kind English theologian who teaches what it means to have genuine, or saving faith. Theo shares the story of Abraham to illustrate the life of a man who trusted the promises of God and walked by faith. Just as the Lord promised Abraham a son and fulfilled His promise, He promised a Savior to us. And sent Jesus into the world at just the right time.2. Loving ObedienceLoving God and obeying Him are two peas in the same pod! If we love God, we will obey Him. Luther and Belfry, two field mice that have befriended Theo, lack obedience and get into trouble wherever they go. Children will learn a valuable lesson and be entertained at the same time as Theo uses the story of Jonah to illustrate the consequences of disobedience, and the blessings that come when we love God through doing what He asks of us.3. ForgivenessNothing is more basic to the Gospel than forgiveness. Did you know that forgiveness in the biblical sense means to set something free? However, learning to forgive is not easy for Theo's furry friends Luther and Belfry. In this episode, Theo teaches the important lesson of forgiving others through the parable of the Unforgiving Servant. For if we do not forgive others, we cannot expect God to forgive us!I received this DVD compliments of Propeller and Whitestone Media for my honest review and wish these were out when my kids were younger. The animation rates right up there with Disney and because the message is short and to the point, kids will love how simple it is to understand the concepts of salvation and faith. My daughter who also viewed this with me, said she will be using them when she has kids of her own. She LOVED them and she's 12!I'd give this DVD a 5 out of 5 stars!Michael Joens is the producer and director of Theo and has produced dozens of animated commercials for Milton Bradley, Hasbro, Kenner, McDonald's and Playskool. In addition to commercial work, he produced and directed the animation segments of the award-winning series, ""McGee and Me,"" as well as the animated ""Adventures in Odyssey"" for Focus on the Family. He is now using his talents to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Theo into all the world.",5,A Great Message You'll Want Your Kids to Watch!,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,2913,"['new', 'animated', 'series', 'Theo', 'teaches', 'guide', 'children', 'adults', 'Biblical', 'theology', 'Theo', 'elderly', 'gentleman', 'who', 'youngest', 'told', 'reminded', 'Belle', 'father', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'who', 'doctrines', 'what', 'sin', 'God', 'character', 'Bible', 'salvation', 'godly-living', 'easy-to-understand', 'illustrations', 'make', 'children', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'Christian', 'faith.Theo', 'messages', 'are', 'well', 'animated', 'accompanied', 'two', 'mice', 'Belfry', 'Luther', 'who', 'have', 'way', 'keeping', 'interesting', 'quest', 'cookies', 'Theo', 'DVD', 'two', 'animated', 'shorts:1', 'Saving', 'FaithDid', 'know', 'same', 'type', 'faith', 'saved', 'Abraham', 'Kids', 'will', 'be', 'entranced', 'Theo', 'kind', 'English', 'theologian', 'who', 'what', 'have', 'genuine', 'saving', 'faith', 'Theo', 'shares', 'story', 'Abraham', 'illustrate', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'trusted', 'promises', 'God', 'walked', 'faith', 'Just', 'Lord', 'promised', 'Abraham', 'son', 'fulfilled', 'promise', 'promised', 'Savior', 'sent', 'Jesus', 'world', 'just', 'right', 'time.2', 'Loving', 'ObedienceLoving', 'God', 'obeying', 'Him', 'are', 'two', 'peas', 'same', 'pod', 'love', 'God', 'will', 'obey', 'Him', 'Luther', 'Belfry', 'two', 'field', 'mice', 'have', 'befriended', 'Theo', 'lack', 'obedience', 'get', 'trouble', 'wherever', 'go', 'Children', 'will', 'learn', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'be', 'entertained', 'same', 'time', 'Theo', 'story', 'Jonah', 'illustrate', 'consequences', 'disobedience', 'blessings', 'come', 'when', 'love', 'God', 'doing', 'what', 'us.3', 'ForgivenessNothing', 'more', 'basic', 'Gospel', 'forgiveness', 'Did', 'know', 'forgiveness', 'biblical', 'sense', 'set', 'something', 'free', 'However', 'learning', 'forgive', 'not', 'easy', 'Theo', 'furry', 'Luther', 'Belfry', 'episode', 'Theo', 'important', 'lesson', 'forgiving', 'others', 'parable', 'Unforgiving', 'Servant', 'do', 'not', 'forgive', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'God', 'forgive', 'received', 'DVD', 'compliments', 'Propeller', 'Whitestone', 'Media', 'honest', 'review', 'wish', 'were', 'out', 'when', 'kids', 'were', 'younger', 'animation', 'rates', 'right', 'there', 'Disney', 'message', 'short', 'point', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'how', 'simple', 'understand', 'concepts', 'salvation', 'faith', 'daughter', 'who', 'also', 'viewed', 'said', 'will', 'be', 'using', 'when', 'kids', 'own', 'LOVED', '12', ""'d"", 'give', 'DVD', '5', '5', 'stars', 'Michael', 'Joens', 'producer', 'director', 'Theo', 'produced', 'dozens', 'animated', 'commercials', 'Milton', 'Bradley', 'Hasbro', 'Kenner', 'McDonald', 'Playskool', 'addition', 'commercial', 'work', 'produced', 'directed', 'animation', 'segments', 'award-winning', 'series', 'McGee', 'Me', 'as', 'well', 'animated', 'Adventures', 'Odyssey', 'Focus', 'Family', 'now', 'using', 'talents', 'present', 'Gospel', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Theo', 'world']",Theo: God's Love
1457047,A10UPYF30K74H0,B005ETZEPI,"Trinity Rose ""book lover""","[3, 3]","I was asked to review this wonderful DVD. It is of a man named Theo who loves the Lord and wants to teach children about the important things of the Lord. Theo Presents is a most lovable, interesting cartoon. Many cartoons are poorly put together and seem to lack imagination, but not Theo. This is a brilliant cartoon that is full of teachings and love of the Lord.The one I reviewed is called Saving Faith and it is about 10 minutes long. It tells about the life of Abraham and how he had faith and always believed in God.The creator has worked on many very famous, award-winning series and commercials, but always wanted to teach the word to children in cartoon form.I know without a doubt this is going to be a very big, winning series. The cartoon I reviewed was intriguing, but very simple to understand and the characters so very special. Theo an Englishman and two cute mice.This series is awesome and can't wait to view the other ones when they come out. The titles below are the ones to come next.Really highly recommend this DVD and besides being very entertaining, these DVDs are full of many lessons. These cartoons are for children of all ages. Don't you love cartoons?
