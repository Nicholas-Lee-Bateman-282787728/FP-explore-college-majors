Between classes and wisecracks from ever-present friend Buddy (Willie Aames), Charles is always on hand to lend an ear or give a little advice to Jamie, Sarah or Adam Powell.Particularly memorable episodes include ""Buddy Comes to Dinner,"" where an unfortunate little accident causes Buddy to recuperate (annoyingly) at the Powells'; and ""The Naked Truth,"" where Charles makes the discovery that a girl he's attending an art lecture for is involved in a way he never dreamed.If you want some guaranteed laughs, make sure to give Charles a try!",4,Classic '80s comedy!,1238112000,"03 27, 2009",2009,927,"['can', 'forget', 'awkward', 'transition', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'Pembroke', 'family', 'suddenly', 'moving', 'away', 'basically', 'leaving', 'Charles', 'live-in', 'childcare', 'whoever', 'else', 'moves', 'house', 'show', 'full', 'fun.Scott', 'Baio', 'Charles', 'college', 'student', 'helping', 'cover', 'expenses', 'boarding', 'Powells', 'local', 'family', 'three', 'adolescent', 'children', 'Between', 'classes', 'wisecracks', 'ever-present', 'friend', 'Buddy', 'Willie', 'Aames', 'Charles', 'always', 'hand', 'lend', 'ear', 'give', 'little', 'advice', 'Jamie', 'Sarah', 'Adam', 'Powell.Particularly', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'include', 'Buddy', 'Comes', 'Dinner', 'where', 'unfortunate', 'little', 'accident', 'causes', 'Buddy', 'recuperate', 'annoyingly', 'Powells', 'Naked', 'Truth', 'where', 'Charles', 'discovery', 'girl', 'attending', 'art', 'lecture', 'involved', 'way', 'never', 'dreamed.If', 'want', 'guaranteed', 'laughs', 'make', 'sure', 'give', 'Charles', 'try']",N/A

You can see it in his performances in each episode. (Eventually he ends up writing and directing episodes too in later seasons!)For whatever reson, the studio, the network or the cast themselves - the Pembroke's are written out of the show. As a result, the home is then taken over by the Powell's. and - as luck would have it - no one told Charles - especially that he came with the house as part of the deal!The first episode is a cross-over confusion - and then as the season progesses the show picks up charm, humanity and a lot of heart. And the introduction - and eventual regular cast appearance/member of Ellen Travolta (John's sister) as Scott's mother is hysterically real and heartfelt!I like the chemistry and the warmth of the Powell's and I can tell Scott and his best friend Buddy played by the delightfully dim-witted Willie Aimes must have had a great time doing this show.It's perfect for the family and kids and has a lot of moral and ehtical situations that are not IN YOUR FACE, but real to the story and characters.
