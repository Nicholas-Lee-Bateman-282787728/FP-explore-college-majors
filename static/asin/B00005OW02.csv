673094,A9E6BXLCOBL40,B00005OW02,Luis C. Diaz,"[5, 6]","Queensryche delivers a strong and intense performance in these DVD. As with many 80's metal bands they seem to be in their second wind after a few years out of the spotlight. But unlike other metal bands, Queensryche outcome of recorded material has never stopped so this video (and the double CD of the same name) antology provides fans with an updated summary of the band's career. The band is in top form and the songs are played with energy.The concert was shot in video camera so you get the feeling of being inside the venue that night. The venue in which it was shot was not that big anyway and the stage set is quite simple so you can very much focus on the performance. Sound and video on the DVD are quite good and this completes an excelent package. My only complaint is that the CD has many more songs than the DVD and it would have been nice to have more.The DVD extras are as usual interviews, band story (by the way the letters on the screen are so small that you have to get close to the TV to see them) and they are nice but not essencials.",5,Very Well Recorded and Performed,1014076800,"02 19, 2002",2002,1057,"['Queensryche', 'strong', 'intense', 'performance', 'DVD', 'many', '80', 'metal', 'seem', 'be', 'second', 'wind', 'few', 'years', 'spotlight', 'other', 'metal', 'bands', 'Queensryche', 'outcome', 'recorded', 'material', 'never', 'stopped', 'so', 'video', 'double', 'CD', 'same', 'name', 'antology', 'fans', 'updated', 'summary', 'band', 'career', 'band', 'top', 'form', 'songs', 'are', 'played', 'energy.The', 'concert', 'was', 'shot', 'video', 'camera', 'so', 'get', 'feeling', 'being', 'venue', 'night', 'venue', 'was', 'shot', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'anyway', 'stage', 'set', 'quite', 'simple', 'can', 'very', 'much', 'focus', 'performance', 'Sound', 'video', 'DVD', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'excelent', 'package', 'only', 'complaint', 'CD', 'many', 'more', 'songs', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'more.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'usual', 'interviews', 'band', 'story', 'way', 'letters', 'screen', 'are', 'so', 'small', 'have', 'get', 'close', 'TV', 'see', 'are', 'nice', 'not', 'essencials']",N/A

Cappetto ""RickDC""","[6, 7]","I love Queensryche and its great to see they are coming out with DVDs, this one and also Operation Live Crime which was released on Video... The newer one Live Evolution Is like a Video Anthology Live. It covers songs that span each era in The epic Queensryche History. Even with changes Queensryche has remained one of Rock N rolls most talented Hard rock bands and Goeff Tate is an Excellent singer, one of the best in rock history. The DVD Looks and Sounds Great and is in the bigger letterbox format. I love every song on the DVD and if I have to pick highlights they would be The Lady Wore Black, Take Hold Of The Flame, Queen Of The Ruche, The Mindcrime Suit (all of it), Silent Lucidity, Jet City Women and Breakdown.

673097,A2VLF9FE68LFX6,B00005OW02,R. L. Hodges,"[42, 47]","I was there, both nights, and was a part of this DVD ...  I really wanted to give this DVD 4 stars, but I have to give it 3 for all the incredible stuff they idiotically LEFT OUT.  I've been a huge fan of these guys since the first EP in '83.  I also live in Seattle, and have been a die hard fan all along with the best of 'em.  I've seen them in concert several times.  This DVD simply doesn't do the show justice - AT ALL.  The band was excellent, the music was flawless.  The DVD doesn't contain even a fraction of the material covered between both shows. Queensryche nearly played every song they ever wrote between both shows.  Another thing:  I saw them in 1997 in Sean Diego, and it was the Queensryche I have always known.  But now, - holy cow. - Queensryche appears to be really tired these days (I was pretty dissappointed after seeing how everyone except Scott looked like they were drugged or just really super tired).  Geoff, it's actually ok to walk around your own stage.  Michael, open those eyes up a little more and convince us that you're still coherent.  (I know they've been doing this for 2 decades, but jeez, if you're recording a DVD and live album, you at least need to fake it a little better than that!).  The band was more animated the second night (most likely after some serious ""coaching""), but not by a whole lot.  The audience was loud, and fun, and all us aging die-hard fans are still in love with this band - and for some pathetic reason, you can't even hear the audience on the DVD or CD except between songs - which removes half the fun right there.  What a loss.  When everyone is shouting ""Revolution Calling"", you can barely hear the audience, which doesn't work well for the song.  EDon't ge me wrong, the sound quality is excellent.  But even though it sounds great, we didn't want another studio album.  Also, the DVD just doesn't show that these fans absolutely adore, idolize and love Geoff.  They went nuts every time Geoff said something or did something cool on stage - all lost.  Didn't make it to the DVD.  They totally left all the stuff you paid to see on the cutting room floor.  They did nearly all of Mindcrime and Rage the first night, while playing materials off their later albums the second night.  The first night's set blew everyone's mind.  Geoff's ""cool guy"" entrance nearly brought down the roof, and they LEFT IT OUT.  The second night was less impressive music wise, but the band was more animated.  The Music CD is flawless, the DVD is chopped up, but still a must have.  I have no idea why they didn't include the coolest moments of the show on the DVD, though, that' really ticks me off.  That is the reason for the 3 instead of the 4.  Queensryche COULD have really given their fans a much better treat.  It's well worth the money, but don't expect another Livecrime - It's nowhere near that magnitude.",3,"Accurate Review - I was at the show, both nights",1004400000,"10 30, 2001",2001,2874,"['was', 'there', 'nights', 'was', 'part', 'DVD', 'really', 'wanted', 'give', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'have', 'give', '3', 'incredible', 'stuff', 'idiotically', 'LEFT', 'OUT', ""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'guys', 'first', 'EP', ""'83"", 'also', 'live', 'Seattle', 'have', 'been', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'concert', 'several', 'times', 'DVD', 'simply', ""n't"", 'do', 'show', 'justice', 'AT', 'ALL', 'band', 'was', 'excellent', 'music', 'was', 'flawless', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'contain', 'even', 'fraction', 'material', 'covered', 'shows', 'Queensryche', 'nearly', 'played', 'song', 'ever', 'wrote', 'shows', 'thing', 'saw', '1997', 'Sean', 'Diego', 'was', 'Queensryche', 'have', 'always', 'known', 'now', 'holy', 'cow', 'Queensryche', 'be', 'really', 'tired', 'days', 'was', 'pretty', 'dissappointed', 'seeing', 'how', 'everyone', 'Scott', 'looked', 'were', 'drugged', 'just', 'really', 'super', 'tired', 'Geoff', 'actually', 'ok', 'walk', 'own', 'stage', 'Michael', 'open', 'eyes', 'up', 'little', 'more', 'convince', ""'re"", 'still', 'coherent', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', '2', 'decades', 'jeez', ""'re"", 'recording', 'DVD', 'live', 'album', 'least', 'need', 'fake', 'little', 'better', 'band', 'was', 'more', 'animated', 'second', 'night', 'most', 'likely', 'serious', 'coaching', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'audience', 'was', 'loud', 'fun', 'aging', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'are', 'still', 'love', 'band', 'pathetic', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'hear', 'audience', 'DVD', 'CD', 'songs', 'fun', 'right', 'there', 'What', 'loss', 'When', 'everyone', 'shouting', 'Revolution', 'Calling', 'can', 'barely', 'hear', 'audience', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'song', 'EDo', ""n't"", 'ge', 'wrong', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'even', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'studio', 'album', 'Also', 'DVD', 'just', ""n't"", 'show', 'fans', 'absolutely', 'adore', 'idolize', 'love', 'Geoff', 'went', 'nuts', 'time', 'Geoff', 'said', 'something', 'did', 'something', 'cool', 'stage', 'lost', 'Did', ""n't"", 'make', 'DVD', 'totally', 'left', 'stuff', 'paid', 'see', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'did', 'nearly', 'Mindcrime', 'Rage', 'first', 'night', 'playing', 'materials', 'later', 'second', 'night', 'first', 'night', 'set', 'blew', 'everyone', 'mind', 'Geoff', 'cool', 'guy', 'entrance', 'nearly', 'brought', 'down', 'roof', 'LEFT', 'IT', 'OUT', 'second', 'night', 'was', 'less', 'impressive', 'music', 'wise', 'band', 'was', 'more', 'animated', 'Music', 'CD', 'flawless', 'DVD', 'chopped', 'up', 'still', 'must', 'have', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'coolest', 'moments', 'show', 'DVD', 'though', 'really', 'ticks', 'off', 'reason', '3', 'instead', '4', 'Queensryche', 'COULD', 'have', 'really', 'given', 'fans', 'much', 'better', 'treat', 'well', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Livecrime', 'nowhere', 'magnitude']",N/A
