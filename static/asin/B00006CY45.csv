The main character  Akito Tenkawa is a boy with a mysterious past he was a pilot but is scared to fight so he becomes a cook he gets fired from his job because every time there is an attack on Earth he freezes up and then starts having like a panic attack.So heading home on bicycle he hits this car and the luggage attached to the car falls this girl and guy come out of the car and Akito starts helping the girl pick her stuff up. The Girl asked if they have met before and he says no after that she leaves and he finds a picture of a little girl and him as a kid and then realizes  that the girl is a friend he had on Mars when he lived there. He wanted to ask her something so he follows the car. To make a long story short she is the captain of a ship called the Nadesico and he becomes a cook/pilot of a robot called an Aestevalis.

The story have a lot of twist and unexpect development that take you by the seat and keep you guessing about what will happen next. It start off looking like any other mecha shows but becomes more and more complex - it's tough to not reveal spoilers! It also showed the different sides of the battle - those who wants peace and those who want to wage war - even on their own side! There are a lot of reference material and pseudo science used in this dvd series - they do it in a interesting way that make it look like certain type of Japanese child's show (I don't have any idea which specific shows but this type of show have been used as a parody in a few other anime dvds) as they explain technology terms in a simple way that the general public understand but it's also funny as the characters dress up like either kids or bunnies!

712298,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B00006CY45,coopertex,"[1, 2]","Takes place in the future, the humans are being invaded by an alien race called, Jovian Lizards. Nedesico gets a bit more into the technological aspects of the story, which may confuse younger viewers. There are several episodes that explained the power behind the ship, Nadesico and its weaponry. The ship, Nadesico, is very advanced, it has an auto-defense system which kicks in if attacked. In one later episode I learned more details into the technology behind the ship. Aside from having a force shield, it ran on a new engine that caused a distortion field.  Nadesico operates on a type of anti-matter energy source and is capable of firing a Gravity Blast, a new type of weapon that other Earth ships didn't have. The ship also feeds power to the mechas  as they do battle; even though the mechas have their own battery power, the ship sort of ""transmits"" energy to power the mechas. If they strayed too far from the transmission area, they would loose part of their power and rely on their back-up batteries. The character animation and designs are beautiful to look at. The music and sound fx are also very good. This series is similar to ""The Irresponsible Captain Tylor"", but it is unique enough to set it apart. It does have a wacky crew, who are funny and cute. There are just a few flaws that prevent it from receiving a perfect rating... Akito, the supposed star of the show is so annoying, that I just wished that they had killed him off. Instead you'll get treated to his ear-popping screams. And he screams very often over the silliest things. What's worst is that since he is the supposed star, you get to see a lot of him in every single episode. However, during the rest of the show you'll enjoy mech battles, almost as good as the Gundam series, also spaceship battles and good character development. This anime overall is excellent, but not perfect, as the show is almost ruined by the moron, Akito. Good for all ages. Ends on 26.

It mostly makes fun of gundam and evangelion, but it also takes stabs at many other mecha anime.  If you are not familiar with any other mecha shows it is still a good time.  The story and characters are off the wall right from the start, and then the story will grab your attention.  What makes this show sooo good is that while it will have you laughing till you cry at the beginning, the story actually sobers up and becomes generally good by the middle and end.  Definitely a show to watch with friends, and also a good one of the few shows that has a good English voice cast.This particular set is a knock-off version with bad video quality.

712302,A34JAXR0W215IP,B00006CY45,Das Book,"[0, 0]","At the risk of trafficking in tired cliches, Martian Successor Nadesico has quite literally something for everyone: Cute girls (and let's be honest, guys too), humor, action, drama, and an intelligent storyline.  Plus mecha, of course, and lots of them.  What more could you possibly want?  It's probably not the greatest place to begin if you're new to anime, given the sheer number of references to other anime series and jokes about otaku culture; but honestly, most of these are so oblique that they'll pass unnoticed, particularly the talent competition near the end of the series, which is a parody of Macross (I didn't catch that one myself, having never seen Macross, or Robotech as it was called in the States).To be fair, I can see how some otaku (translation for the uninitiated: fanatics) would find the show's characterization of otaku unflattering.  But to be honest, that's kind of the point; Martian Successor Nadesico is as much a study of otaku culture as it is a gripping story of political intrigue and space battles, but more than that, it's a chance for otaku to laugh at themselves.  Come on, admit it, you'd find cosplay bizarre if you were looking at it as an outsider.  I find Civil War reenactors strange, but I'm not about to try to stop them from doing it if that's how they want to spend their weekends.  And make no mistake, Martian Successor Nadesico would be hilarious even without the otaku references; my favorite bit from the first episode involves Akito catching a suitcase full of Yurika's panties with his forehead, and if that doesn't make you laugh, I have very little hope for you.  (In fact, come to think of it, most of the best jokes involve either Akito and Yurika's ""relationship"" or Mizumi's predilection for weird, inappropriate puns.)All of this isn't to say that Martian Successor Nadesico doesn't have its flaws.  Every so often the plot seems a little confused about whether it wants to be funny or dramatic; it's not so bad as to make the show unwatchable, but it's definitely jarring when it does happen.  I also got the distinct impression that the writers didn't know how to wrap everything up in the final episode; as a result, the story stops dead and many loose ends go untied, particularly the meaning of the metal plate that a certain character drops near the end.  (Ruri passes a comment about the unresolved plot points during her end-of-episode narration, so it's possible this was done deliberately.  Or maybe it's just a cop-out and they really didn't know how to end things.  I'm gonna have to lean toward the latter on this one.)  But overall, I'd say that this is one series that every otaku needs to see at least once.  As is my wont, I watched each episode in English, then again in Japanese with subtitles, and I highly recommend this technique to get the full effect.  You'll get to hear Spike Spencer's spot-on performance as Akito and Kira Vincent-Davis' perfect deadpan as Ruri, plus you'll get to hear all the jokes as they were intended in the original Japanese.  (As much as possible, at least, because I'm quite sure that most of Mizumi's puns would be indecipherable to an English-speaking viewer if translated literally.)  Because, you know, that's what real otaku do.

The Jovians MAY be on the RIGHT side,  the Nergal Corporation is not interested in librating anybody and the Earth government seems to be trying to hide something.The characters, from the super-intelligent Ruri Hoshino to the brilliant, if somewhat unbalanced, Commander Yurika, all have funny AND serious sides to their nature.The series asks tons of questions, about right and wrong, love and friendship, peace and war.  Even after 26 episodes, not everything is answered, but it does give you a lot to chew on.

I took to watching Anime in junior high Martian Successor Nadesico was one of the series that really solidified my love for Anime. The story centers around the main character Akito, a member of a Martian colony that, be a random set of events, ends up a crew member on the space ship Nadesico (captained by his childhood friend of course). As the story progress we watch the ship get turned upside down as the crew continues its daily life (forming love triangles, battling aliens, dealing with near death situations...you know, that kind of everyday stuff).For those of your that are into more modern Anime this may not be your cup of tea. For those of you that remember shows like  Rouroni Kenshin, Outlaw Star, and Trigun, then you'll feel right at home with the style of animation and voice acting that seems to have been lost in recent years.Without giving too much of the story away, Akito and his childhood friend Yurika team up to fight the Jovian lizards only to find out that things are never so simple (what with the plot twists and all) and end up making the story twist and turn and end up one of those shows you'll never forget.I said before I started watching Anime in junior high and this was one of the shows that really got me hooked, though sadly I never got to finish it (ironic considering Akito did the same thing with Gekigangar), though I have finally added to my collection (almost some 10 years later) and I couldn't be happier because yeah, its just that good.",5,Worth Every Penny,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,1534,"['series', 'really', 'home', 'took', 'watching', 'Anime', 'junior', 'high', 'Martian', 'Successor', 'Nadesico', 'was', 'one', 'series', 'really', 'solidified', 'love', 'Anime', 'story', 'centers', 'main', 'character', 'Akito', 'member', 'Martian', 'colony', 'be', 'random', 'set', 'events', 'up', 'crew', 'member', 'space', 'ship', 'Nadesico', 'captained', 'childhood', 'friend', 'course', 'story', 'progress', 'watch', 'ship', 'get', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'crew', 'daily', 'life', 'forming', 'love', 'triangles', 'battling', 'aliens', 'dealing', 'near', 'death', 'situations', 'know', 'kind', 'everyday', 'stuff', '.For', 'are', 'more', 'modern', 'Anime', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'remember', 'shows', 'Rouroni', 'Kenshin', 'Outlaw', 'Star', 'Trigun', 'then', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'right', 'home', 'style', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'recent', 'years.Without', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'away', 'Akito', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Yurika', 'team', 'up', 'fight', 'Jovian', 'lizards', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'so', 'simple', 'what', 'plot', 'twists', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'story', 'twist', 'turn', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'shows', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget.I', 'said', 'started', 'watching', 'Anime', 'junior', 'high', 'was', 'one', 'shows', 'really', 'got', 'hooked', 'sadly', 'never', 'got', 'finish', 'ironic', 'considering', 'Akito', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'Gekigangar', 'have', 'finally', 'added', 'collection', 'almost', '10', 'years', 'later', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'yeah', 'just', 'good']",Martian Successor Nadesico - The Complete Chronicles

The fact is this show comes close to being the most perfect show I have ever seen.  It has a plot so carefully laided out you shouldn't get lost but yet doesn't get boring and repetative.  The basic story of Nadesico is that the earth in under invasion by a mysterious race called the jovians and it is up to the crew of the most powerful battleship, the Nadesico, to stop the invasion.  This story is mixed with sexual inuendo and humor that doesn't bog down the story with a ton of depression.Charecter development is a step above all other shows.  each charecter has their own reason to be on the nadesico and each one has their own personality.  You feel the pain of war in a way that makes you think how noble any war really is and to question what is important in your life.The artwork done in the show is incredable.  you can think of it as a simplistic yet detailed style.  this gives way for the story to come out on top in this show.In the end this show is the best I ahve ever seen and belive that it always will be.  even the most unenthuesed about anime can find something that they will like in here.

712308,A3FIKATQ286DMV,B00006CY45,Niko,"[5, 5]","(SPOILERS INCLUDED!)You know people, when I first started watching this show I thought that it would be just a very good parody, as most reviewers stated it.True is that it mixes all sorts of stories and plots inside it: Comedy, drama, action, Mechas, science fiction, romance, an anime inside an anime (it is actually hard to explain but easy to understand once you watch the shows) etc.At the beginning it is mostly a light-hearted show, making successfully fun out of everything and the main story resolves in three main axes: a) Humans and their forces fighting against aliens, b) Aliens fighting against humans and c) a private company that has the strongest space battleship and hired the craziest crew for this purpose, fights for humanity but has its own agenda. This is how the story mainly evolves till somewhere it reaches the middle of the episodes.However, it starts to get very emotional and presents itself to have many plot twists such as: one side betrays the other, propaganda and manipulating the truth, political and military power games going on and romance evolving all around it. Not to mention the fact that the aliens proof to be humans as well.  People will die by sacrificing themselves for the ones they love and in times it gets very emotional if not dramatic at all.Yes, the story - according to most reviewers - in my humble opinion, is much underestimated. You will see that it has a solid storyline, great character development and the message it brings across is LOVE (SPOILER!) and the love between the female captain and the Nr. 1 pilot of Nadesico is the one that will eventually safe everyone; and the series have a (bittersweet in a way) happy ending. Additionally, all the twists and questions will be answered in the end.The animation is not bad at all: In order to get a good picture, imagine an animation that is a little bit better than the one that Evangelion or Cowboy Bebop had.As for the opening - finish songs they are very good and you will love its music.In my humble opinion, no matter what kind of anime fan you are, this show will definitely have something for you and you will love the series.Is it worth buying it? I definitely will answer with a YES!Either way, if you cannot afford the money for it than at least rent it because it is worth watching it.Just keep in mind to watch the series till the end and then make your final judgment.I hope that I could help in a way clarifying some things about Martian Successor Nadesico.",5,Underestimated by being only a parody!,1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,2486,"['SPOILERS', 'INCLUDED', 'know', 'people', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'very', 'good', 'parody', 'most', 'reviewers', 'stated', 'it.True', 'sorts', 'stories', 'plots', 'Comedy', 'drama', 'action', 'Mechas', 'science', 'fiction', 'romance', 'anime', 'anime', 'actually', 'hard', 'explain', 'easy', 'understand', 'once', 'watch', 'shows', 'etc.At', 'beginning', 'mostly', 'light-hearted', 'show', 'making', 'successfully', 'fun', 'everything', 'main', 'story', 'resolves', 'three', 'main', 'axes', 'Humans', 'forces', 'fighting', 'aliens', 'b', 'fighting', 'humans', 'c', 'private', 'company', 'strongest', 'space', 'battleship', 'hired', 'craziest', 'crew', 'purpose', 'fights', 'humanity', 'own', 'agenda', 'how', 'story', 'mainly', 'till', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'episodes.However', 'get', 'very', 'emotional', 'have', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'such', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'propaganda', 'manipulating', 'truth', 'political', 'military', 'power', 'games', 'going', 'romance', 'evolving', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'aliens', 'proof', 'be', 'humans', 'well', 'People', 'will', 'die', 'sacrificing', 'ones', 'love', 'times', 'very', 'emotional', 'not', 'dramatic', 'all.Yes', 'story', 'according', 'most', 'reviewers', 'humble', 'opinion', 'much', 'underestimated', 'will', 'see', 'solid', 'storyline', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'message', 'across', 'LOVE', 'SPOILER', 'love', 'female', 'captain', 'Nr', '1', 'pilot', 'Nadesico', 'one', 'will', 'eventually', 'safe', 'everyone', 'series', 'have', 'bittersweet', 'way', 'happy', 'ending', 'Additionally', 'twists', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'answered', 'end.The', 'animation', 'not', 'bad', 'order', 'get', 'good', 'picture', 'imagine', 'animation', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'one', 'Evangelion', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'had.As', 'opening', 'finish', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'will', 'love', 'music.In', 'humble', 'opinion', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'anime', 'fan', 'are', 'show', 'will', 'definitely', 'have', 'something', 'will', 'love', 'series.Is', 'buying', 'definitely', 'will', 'answer', 'YES', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'money', 'least', 'rent', 'worth', 'watching', 'it.Just', 'keep', 'mind', 'watch', 'series', 'end', 'then', 'make', 'final', 'judgment.I', 'hope', 'could', 'help', 'way', 'clarifying', 'things', 'Martian', 'Successor', 'Nadesico']",Martian Successor Nadesico - The Complete Chronicles

712310,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B00006CY45,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[36, 39]","The hero who became...an anime fan?Yes indeed, Nadesico is definitely the most enjoyable anime series I've ever seen. So what exactly is Nadesico? Basically, it's a Mecha comedy. But in actuality, it's much more than that. Most comedies go for one kind of laugh. Some shoot for all kinds, but some of the jokes fall flat. I can honestly say that Nadesico is a brilliant show. It makes fun of EVERYTHING. It makes fun of Mecha anime, it makes fun of sci-fi, it makes fun of video games, it makes fun pop culture, it even makes fun of the fact that some of it's puns are totally silly. And seemingly EVERY joke is hilarious. Seriously. It would seem almost impossible that you would not find SOMETHING funny in this show (especially if you find the stereotype of a kid turned hero or a guy being chased by tons of girls funny). But wait, there's more.Not only is this show hilarious, it also features great characters that (once again) know they are the stereotyped kind and have fun with it. The voices (even in the English dub) are absolutely perfect. They convey everything from serious drama to wacked out comedy perfectly without skipping a beat. And then there is the plot.The plot may seem on the surface to be just a parody of all the Mecha shows that have come and gone in recent history. But look closer, and you'll find that the plot twists and turns as well as any. Seriously, when the story and drama kicks into high gear, I'd rank this show with Macross any day.But, you may ask, is every episode the same thing? Mecha action and comedy? No, indeed. The variety in the episodes is truly staggering. You have TWO World War II themed episodes (one about tank battles, another about submarine battles), an episode out of chronological order, a standing in space episode, a talent show episode, and of course a showdown epsisode (to mention just a few). And every single episode is flawlessly executed. Even the review episode is a brilliant take on the episode reviews in all Mecha sagas.And for what it's worth, the animation and music in this show are both EXCELLENT. Don't belive me? Just watch the into and ending. Sure, lots of shows have great intros, and lots of shows have great endings. But both?All in all, this is one of the most brilliant shows I've ever seen. The only show I could maybe compare to it is the excellent CGI cartoon show ""Reboot"". In it's third season, it also features epsidoes with parody famous movies and pop culture, and it also has a great story, cool characters, and an awesome plot. If you love Mecha anime, you must have this show. If you hate anime, you still need to try it. It is very balanced show, and you're sure to find something to love. Yes, you've probably seen battles, animation, characters, and plot like this before. But in this world, there's no such thing as originality (or as Picaso said ""Good artists copy, great artists steal"". Nadesico makes no bones about it, they're stealing.
