1304729,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG9800,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","The thoroughly entertaining and easily watchable `I Love You Phillip Morris' may not seem like your typical Friday Night Fare, and for some of you the blatant homosexual themes will probably be a major detractor, but one thing that this film has going for it is a tendency to push the envelope and a fearless spirit, which only helps to sell us on the film's overt ridiculousness.  Oh yeah, and it's kind of based on a true story.  Jim Carrey, comedian extraordinaire, tackles one of his most outlandish roles to date; that of Steven Russell...a successful business man turned con-man after an accident causes an epiphany that forces him out of the closet and into the `very expensive' lifestyle of the gay and the proud.  His cons catch up with him though and soon he finds himself in jail.  There he meets the soft spoken and instantly adorable Phillip Morris.  For the love of his newfound `friend', Steven continues his cons in the pursuit of real happiness with the love of his life.  Love is tricky though, and so is conning.  Jim Carrey sells every scene.  He's always had a knack for the extreme, and he definitely takes this character to the extreme.  It was Ewan McGregor that really nailed it for me though.  The way he handles what could have been nothing but a stock character (dimwitted yet suffering significant other) is truly great.  He captures the naivety needed to draw us into Phillip, and his soft-spoken demeanor is both an ode to the lifestyle and a play on the film's apparent `stereotypical' understanding of it.  The script is sharp, as is the film's pacing.  They cover a lot of ground in a short time, yet it never feels rushed.  I do think that it goes a little too `Farrelly Brothers' at times with the gags, but when it plays it straight it gets it just right; no pun intended.",4,Just push it!,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,1809,"['thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'easily', 'watchable', 'Love', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'typical', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Fare', 'blatant', 'homosexual', 'themes', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'major', 'detractor', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'going', 'tendency', 'push', 'envelope', 'fearless', 'spirit', 'only', 'sell', 'film', 'overt', 'ridiculousness', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'kind', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'comedian', 'extraordinaire', 'one', 'most', 'outlandish', 'roles', 'date', 'Steven', 'Russell', 'successful', 'business', 'man', 'turned', 'con-man', 'accident', 'epiphany', 'closet', 'very', 'expensive', 'lifestyle', 'gay', 'proud', 'cons', 'catch', 'up', 'soon', 'jail', 'soft', 'spoken', 'instantly', 'adorable', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'love', 'newfound', 'friend', 'Steven', 'cons', 'pursuit', 'real', 'happiness', 'love', 'life', 'Love', 'tricky', 'so', 'conning', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'scene', 'always', 'had', 'knack', 'extreme', 'definitely', 'character', 'extreme', 'was', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'really', 'nailed', 'way', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'stock', 'character', 'dimwitted', 'yet', 'suffering', 'significant', 'other', 'truly', 'great', 'naivety', 'needed', 'draw', 'Phillip', 'soft-spoken', 'demeanor', 'ode', 'lifestyle', 'play', 'film', 'apparent', 'stereotypical', 'understanding', 'script', 'sharp', 'film', 'pacing', 'cover', 'lot', 'ground', 'short', 'time', 'never', 'rushed', 'do', 'think', 'little', 'too', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'times', 'gags', 'when', 'straight', 'just', 'right', 'pun', 'intended']",N/A

1304733,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B002ZG9800,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[5, 5]","This film is based on a book, which - in turn - is based on the real life exploits of Steven Russell, an embezzler, con artist and hopeless romantic, who repeatedly managed to get out of prison through devious means.  Steven starts off as a devout church-going family man, working as a cop as he tries to track down his birth mother. He and his family then move to Texas, where he starts work for a produce company, and simultaneously starts to explore his same-sex attractions, which he had been repressing for the most part.  After a brush with death, Steven decides to come clean about his sexual orientation to his wife, and moves to Florida to live with a boyfriend.  Problem: Being an ""a-list"" gay in Miami is expensive, and Steven sees insurance fraud as the means to that end. He gets caught and sent to prison, where he meets Phillip Morris, and instantly falls in love. Already an expert at ""working the system"" behind the prison walls, Steven manages to get assigned to share Philip's cell, and, when he gets released, returns posing as Phillip's attorney to get him sprung as well.  The couple live an ideally life ... for a while, until Steven's compulsions again (and again) leave them running from the law.As Steven, Jim Carey provides an interesting combination of surprising empathy and sensitivity, combined with his trademark over-the-top comic persona, which is still a little grating in places. Evan McGregor is wasted in the role of Phillip, which he plays with an simple wide-eyed naivety that fits the part. Other than some self-loathing anti-gay comments Steven makes while dealing with his sexuality, and a few bits with outlandish outfits, the film stays remarkably away from stereotypical depictions, and the few outsiders who know their relationship seem to accept it as no big deal.That said, this is a tough film to rate.  Unlike the book, which I am told had a serious tone throughout, the film tries to be part documentary / ""true crime"" drama, and part light romantic comedy. It is that battle between madcap comedy and serious drama that makes this film tough to get into, which I believe is its main failing, which I chalk up to the direction.  The acting is good (not great), and it's worth a look.  I give it four stars out of five.",4,"Carey/McGregor make a convincing gay couple, but film is a bit uneven.",1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,2270,"['film', 'based', 'book', 'turn', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'exploits', 'Steven', 'Russell', 'embezzler', 'con', 'artist', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'managed', 'get', 'prison', 'devious', 'means', 'Steven', 'off', 'devout', 'church-going', 'family', 'man', 'working', 'cop', 'track', 'down', 'birth', 'mother', 'family', 'then', 'move', 'Texas', 'where', 'work', 'produce', 'company', 'simultaneously', 'explore', 'same-sex', 'attractions', 'had', 'been', 'repressing', 'most', 'part', 'brush', 'death', 'Steven', 'come', 'clean', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'wife', 'moves', 'Florida', 'live', 'boyfriend', 'Problem', 'Being', 'a-list', 'gay', 'Miami', 'expensive', 'Steven', 'insurance', 'fraud', 'means', 'end', 'caught', 'sent', 'prison', 'where', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'instantly', 'love', 'expert', 'working', 'system', 'prison', 'walls', 'Steven', 'get', 'assigned', 'share', 'Philip', 'cell', 'when', 'released', 'posing', 'Phillip', 'attorney', 'get', 'sprung', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'live', 'ideally', 'life', 'while', 'Steven', 'compulsions', 'again', 'again', 'leave', 'running', 'law.As', 'Steven', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'interesting', 'combination', 'surprising', 'empathy', 'sensitivity', 'combined', 'trademark', 'over-the-top', 'comic', 'persona', 'still', 'little', 'grating', 'places', 'Evan', 'McGregor', 'wasted', 'role', 'Phillip', 'simple', 'wide-eyed', 'naivety', 'part', 'Other', 'self-loathing', 'anti-gay', 'comments', 'Steven', 'dealing', 'sexuality', 'few', 'bits', 'outlandish', 'outfits', 'film', 'remarkably', 'away', 'stereotypical', 'depictions', 'few', 'outsiders', 'who', 'know', 'relationship', 'seem', 'accept', 'big', 'deal.That', 'said', 'tough', 'film', 'rate', 'book', 'am', 'told', 'had', 'serious', 'tone', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'part', 'documentary', '/', 'true', 'crime', 'drama', 'part', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'battle', 'madcap', 'comedy', 'serious', 'drama', 'film', 'tough', 'get', 'believe', 'main', 'failing', 'chalk', 'up', 'direction', 'acting', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'look', 'give', 'four', 'five']",N/A

1304738,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG9800,Chris Pandolfi,"[54, 61]","""I Love You Philip Morris"" tells the real life story of Steven Jay Russell, who in 1998 received an unprecedented 144-year prison sentence for fraud, conning, impersonating, and multiple escapes from Houston's Harris County Jail. The film shows us sequences that seem utterly impossible, but in fact actually happened, which only goes to show that truth really is stranger than fiction. No, I will not describe them to you. Enjoying the film depends on the audience's reaction to Russell's actions. It's a little like a magician revealing his secrets; the trick itself is a lot of fun, but seeing what went into making the trick work can be quite fascinating, especially when you realize just how much effort goes into making something look simple. The apparent ease with which he executes his schemes is equally mind boggling.Jim Carrey's portrayal of Russell is a delightful bag of contradictions. He's funny but touching, exaggerated but believable, contemptible but justified, caring but manipulative. There are times when it seems like he's thinking of no one other than himself, and there are other times when it's clear that he does what he does out of love. It's a daring, complex performance, and it's for reasons other than the fact that his character is gay; it establishes that Carrey is capable of something deeper than outlandish personalities and extreme physical comedy. His take on Russell is engaging, although it's not necessarily understandable. This isn't a criticism. Sometimes, it's preferable for audiences to figure out characters for themselves, for them to put their own spin on why certain people are they are way they are.We're given a small glimpse of his childhood, in which he learns that he was adopted. We then flash forward to his early adult years; he's married to a woman who's a bit too religious and perhaps a little ignorant but sweet nonetheless, he has a delightful daughter, and he's the manager of a Texas food service company. But after surviving a car accident, he decides to live his life as an openly gay man, and he leaves his family behind for Miami. It's there he realizes that living a gay lifestyle is more expensive than his salary as a sales manager will allow. So he does what any man vowing to live authentically would do - he becomes a conman. After relatively simple schemes like feigning slips and falls in public places, he plunges headfirst into various types of fraud, including credit card, passport, and insurance. He even sells bad tomatoes.Unfortunately, his crimes catch up with him, and he's arrested and sent to jail in Texas. He learns the ropes quickly; everything essentially boils down to a choice between paying someone off, learning how to fight, or giving someone oral sex. He knows who to talk to and where to guide someone should they need something. He spends all his free time in the library, where he reads nothing but law books. Into his life enters Philip Morris (Ewan McGregor), a soft spoken gay man who was tried and convicted for theft of service. He wants to see if there's a legal way to help an AIDS patient lying in the infirmary. Russell lies and tells Morris that he's a lawyer. The two immediately hit it off. Over the next few weeks, they form their own little slice of heaven in a jail cell, oblivious to the yard beatings and the cell searches.At this point, I'm going to stop describing the plot, for I want you to be surprised by the lengths Russell will go to be with Morris. I will say that what the film, in its own offbeat way, is surprisingly sweet. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's screenplay, based on Steve McVicker's book ""I Love You Philip Morris: A True Story of Life, Love, and Prison Breaks,"" reveals a delicate and finely crafted balancing act between humor and drama; it's funny, though it never resorts to desperate slapstick or gross-out vulgarities, and it's heartfelt, yet it steers clear of broad, contrived sentimentalism. It's bold and appealing - a romantic comedy that refuses to follow the rules of a romantic comedy.Apart from Carrey and McGregor, I was pleasantly surprised by Leslie Mann, who appears briefly but is no less important as Russell's ex-wife, Debbie. Even after learning that he's gay, even after they get divorced, even after he gets sent to jail, the two remain on fairly good terms. This is amazing coming from a woman perpetually hung up on what the Lord does and does not intend to have happen. She believes that Russell is a man who doesn't know who he is and is always searching for something. I guess that makes sense.

My first review gives it one star because I hated it. However, we were watching it with teenagers and a very picky adult. After I wrote the first review and saw all the positive reviews, I put it on again to try to figure out what I was missing. Then came the second review.Suggestions are that you only watch it with people you are really comfortable with and definitely not with kids or teens!1. We watched this movie when we were vacationing in Myrtle beach: four adults, seven kids ranging in ages from 13 to 17. We all thought it was awful so I don't understand all the good reviews. Two of the adults walked out after the first 20 min, I finally left after an hour. And I am the type that watches suspenses and actions (often with violence as you cannot get a good action with no violence) with my kids.I found it to be crude, lots of vulgar lines which I cannot repeat here, explicit scenes that were supposed to be funny but weren't, and just plain terrible. Not funny at all.The film is based on a true story of Steven Russell, played by Jim Carrey, who transformed from small town married cop to gay conman. He ends up in jail and falls in love with one of the inmates, Phillip Morris played by Ethan Hawke, escapes from prison numerous times, all for Phillip who he will do anything for. I thought Ethan Hawke was ok but that Jim Carrey was terrible but it's hard to separate that from the awful lines.I really don't understand all the positive reviews. Even if we had watched it without kids, which I tried to do again last night, I still hated it.Not worth renting, watching, and definitely not worth buying, imho.2. I put the movie back on this evening and this time watched it alone. I can now see why it got good reviews. It was really uncomfortable when we were watching it with kids and my husband is really picky about movies. But being home recuperating from knee surgery gave me the time to try it again. And I have changed my opinion.After seeing it this evening, I could see why people raved about Jim Carrey's performance. He really is phenomenal in it. As is Ewan McGregor who played his part very well. It was interesting and it was touching and the story did hold my interest. When it ended, I thought to myself 'wow, that was actually a good movie'.But again, depends who you watch it with and your mood.",3,"First I hated it, then I could see why it got good reviews!",1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,2420,"['Here', 'first', 'review', 'written', 'earlier', 'today', 'followed', 'one', 'written', 'evening', 'My', 'first', 'review', 'one', 'star', 'hated', 'However', 'were', 'watching', 'teenagers', 'very', 'picky', 'adult', 'wrote', 'first', 'review', 'saw', 'positive', 'reviews', 'put', 'again', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'Then', 'came', 'second', 'review.Suggestions', 'are', 'only', 'watch', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'comfortable', 'definitely', 'not', 'kids', 'teens', '1', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'were', 'vacationing', 'Myrtle', 'beach', 'four', 'adults', 'seven', 'kids', 'ranging', 'ages', '13', '17', 'thought', 'was', 'awful', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'good', 'reviews', 'Two', 'adults', 'walked', 'out', 'first', '20', 'min', 'finally', 'left', 'hour', 'am', 'type', 'suspenses', 'actions', 'often', 'violence', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'good', 'action', 'violence', 'kids.I', 'found', 'be', 'crude', 'lots', 'vulgar', 'lines', 'can', 'not', 'repeat', 'here', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'plain', 'terrible', 'Not', 'funny', 'all.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Steven', 'Russell', 'played', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'who', 'transformed', 'small', 'town', 'married', 'cop', 'gay', 'conman', 'up', 'jail', 'love', 'one', 'inmates', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'prison', 'numerous', 'times', 'Phillip', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'thought', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'was', 'ok', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', 'terrible', 'hard', 'separate', 'awful', 'lines.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Even', 'had', 'watched', 'kids', 'tried', 'do', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'still', 'hated', 'it.Not', 'worth', 'renting', 'watching', 'definitely', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'imho.2', 'put', 'movie', 'back', 'evening', 'time', 'watched', 'alone', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'why', 'got', 'good', 'reviews', 'was', 'really', 'uncomfortable', 'when', 'were', 'watching', 'kids', 'husband', 'really', 'picky', 'movies', 'being', 'home', 'recuperating', 'knee', 'surgery', 'gave', 'time', 'try', 'again', 'have', 'changed', 'opinion.After', 'seeing', 'evening', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'raved', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'performance', 'really', 'phenomenal', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'touching', 'story', 'did', 'hold', 'interest', 'When', 'ended', 'thought', 'myself', ""'wow"", 'was', 'actually', 'good', ""movie'.But"", 'again', 'depends', 'who', 'watch', 'mood']",N/A

1304744,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG9800,C. Sawin,"[31, 38]","When he's not forcing his rather over the top and extremely physical humor down your throat, Jim Carrey is actually an actor with talent. He's proven this fact in films like The Majestic and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Ewan McGregor also has a reputation for making the most out of what he has to work with. He was one of the few things that kept The Island from being a complete waste of time and it seems like nearly everybody loves Trainspotting (and for good reason). But what would a film be like if these two rather talented actors portrayed a gay couple that on top of that was also based on a true story? That's where I Love You Phillip Morris comes in.Steven Jay Russell (Carrey) decides to come out of the closet and be his true self after a fateful car accident. As a gay man, Steven wants to live it up but doesn't make enough money to live the type of life he wants to live. His other calling as a conman begins to show its face and it eventually leads him to prison. Once in prison, he meets Phillip Morris (McGregor) who he eventually falls in love with. They soon begin to realize they can't bear to be apart from one another. Steven takes it upon himself to come up with an elaborate scheme that would keep them together forever, but all doesn't go according to plan. One scheme leads to another, which leads to another, and so on. But even when things seem to be in the clear, Steven finds himself falling into old habits and may lose Phillip because of it. Despite what they say, falling in love isn't nearly as hard as staying out of prison.Steven and Phillip's relationship is the main attraction of the film. The chemistry Carrey and McGregor share on screen is really pretty phenomenal. Jim Carrey gives what is quite possibly the performance of his career. Steven is disturbed and driven in an insane, but ""I'm doing this for your own good"" kind of way. His struggle to figure out who he is is portrayed by Carrey to emotional perfection. Ewan McGregor certainly has his moments, as well. Phillip is shy, somewhat quiet, and is usually taken advantage of by those around him. Watching him go through that as Steven slowly begins to do the same thing to Phillip that everyone else has is half the fun of the character.A love story between two gay men may not be for everyone, so I Love You Phillip Morris is able to offer more than just that. There's the intriguing cinematography. Early on in the film, there's a scene where Steven is tucking his daughter in before bed. As you hear him talking to his daughter, we're shown things like the toilet paper roll in the bathroom and a play tea set in his daughter's bedroom. For some reason, that shot of that toilet paper roll sticks with you the entire film. It's just simple enough to never forget. Even though the film is a drama, there is also quite a bit of comedy in there as well. Steven confronting his mother for something she did in her past is the best example of that. The dialogue is what really sticks out though, especially during the second viewing. There's a speech that Phillip makes to Steven near the end of the film about not being able to love someone who doesn't exist that is exceptional.I Love You Phillip Morris is an emotional and heartfelt love story that's driven by the on-screen chemistry between Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. It's laugh out loud funny one minute and tugging at your heart strings the next, I Love You Phillip Morris is a well-written and well presented drama that deserves to be giving a chance.",4,A fantastic film driven by the engaging chemistry between Carrey and McGregor,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,3525,"['When', 'not', 'forcing', 'rather', 'top', 'extremely', 'physical', 'humor', 'throat', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'actually', 'actor', 'talent', 'proven', 'fact', 'films', 'Majestic', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'also', 'reputation', 'making', 'most', 'what', 'work', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'kept', 'Island', 'being', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'nearly', 'everybody', 'Trainspotting', 'good', 'reason', 'what', 'would', 'film', 'be', 'two', 'rather', 'talented', 'actors', 'portrayed', 'gay', 'couple', 'top', 'was', 'also', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'where', 'Love', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'in.Steven', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'Carrey', 'come', 'closet', 'be', 'true', 'self', 'fateful', 'car', 'accident', 'gay', 'man', 'Steven', 'live', 'up', ""n't"", 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'live', 'type', 'life', 'live', 'other', 'calling', 'conman', 'show', 'face', 'eventually', 'prison', 'Once', 'prison', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'McGregor', 'who', 'eventually', 'love', 'soon', 'begin', 'realize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'be', 'apart', 'one', 'Steven', 'come', 'up', 'elaborate', 'scheme', 'would', 'keep', 'together', 'forever', ""n't"", 'go', 'according', 'plan', 'One', 'scheme', 'so', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'clear', 'Steven', 'falling', 'old', 'habits', 'may', 'lose', 'Phillip', 'what', 'say', 'falling', 'love', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'hard', 'staying', 'prison.Steven', 'Phillip', 'relationship', 'main', 'attraction', 'film', 'chemistry', 'Carrey', 'McGregor', 'share', 'screen', 'really', 'pretty', 'phenomenal', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'what', 'quite', 'possibly', 'performance', 'career', 'Steven', 'disturbed', 'driven', 'insane', ""'m"", 'doing', 'own', 'good', 'kind', 'way', 'struggle', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Carrey', 'emotional', 'perfection', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'certainly', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'Phillip', 'shy', 'somewhat', 'quiet', 'usually', 'taken', 'advantage', 'Watching', 'go', 'through', 'that', 'Steven', 'slowly', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'Phillip', 'everyone', 'else', 'fun', 'character.A', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'Love', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'able', 'offer', 'more', 'just', 'intriguing', 'cinematography', 'Early', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'Steven', 'tucking', 'daughter', 'before', 'bed', 'hear', 'talking', 'daughter', ""'re"", 'shown', 'things', 'toilet', 'paper', 'roll', 'bathroom', 'play', 'tea', 'set', 'daughter', 'bedroom', 'reason', 'shot', 'toilet', 'paper', 'roll', 'sticks', 'entire', 'film', 'just', 'simple', 'enough', 'never', 'forget', 'Even', 'film', 'drama', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'comedy', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'Steven', 'confronting', 'mother', 'something', 'did', 'past', 'best', 'example', 'dialogue', 'what', 'really', 'out', 'especially', 'second', 'viewing', 'speech', 'Phillip', 'Steven', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'love', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'exist', 'exceptional.I', 'Love', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'emotional', 'heartfelt', 'love', 'story', 'driven', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'one', 'minute', 'tugging', 'heart', 'next', 'Love', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'well-written', 'well', 'presented', 'drama', 'be', 'giving', 'chance']",N/A

1304755,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002ZG9800,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS is a rare film, one that hopefully will draw enough audience support because of the participation of  Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor, two of cinema's favorite actors taking on a project that, while controversial to some, ends up being one of the best and most tender love stories on film. The bizarre aspect of this film is that it is based on a book by Steven McVicker whose life story is revealed in the autobiographical book 'I Love You Phillip Morris: A True Story of Life, Love, and Prison Breaks'. The author's true name is Steven Jay Russell, born 1957, a US con artist and impostor, known for escaping from prison multiple times, earning numerous nicknames, including ""Houdini"" and ""King Con"".  The book was adapted for the screen and directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who have been successful in transferring the flavor and the facts of the book into a movie that is part comedy, part drama, and part social commentary.After a brief but meaningful flashback to his youth the film opens with Steven Russell (Jim Carrey, in a career defining role) as a policeman married to hyper-religious Debbie (Leslie Mann) and father to a loving daughter. Steven knows he was adopted and in his role as a policeman he has access to records that bring to finding his biological mother (Barbara Bascombe) who denies his existence.  Steven is crushed and realizing he has been living a life of a constant lie (he has known since childhood that he is gay) has an automobile wreck, survives, but decides to inform his wife that he is gay.  The family moves from Georgia to Texas where Steven wiles his way through jobs as a con artist, finally living an 'out' life with boyfriend Jimmy (the brilliant Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro who is far too underused in American films).  Finding that he cannot support his expensive tastes on his salary he begins his Con Artist career, eventually ending in prison where he adjusts to life, works the system, and falls in love with a sweet little 'blue eyed blond' Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor).  The attraction between the two men is credible and the manner in which Carrey and McGregor create these roles is sincere, healthy, and for once not a parody of gay relationships but instead is a case study in healthy love relationships.  The remainder of the film is a series of tricks and manipulations by Steven to get released from prison so that he can get Phillip released.  It is a series of events that were it not fact would leave the audience saying 'that's not possible', but the story is true and the manner in which the story ends is a revelation.The film is a fine study of the mind of a brilliant con artist coupled with a very tender tale of love and devotion between the two main characters.  The script is excellent with many moments of dialogue that should be quoted but would alter the joy of hearing them fresh as the viewer becomes involved with the characters. Jim Carrey gives his best performance ever, Ewan McGregor continues to impress with the spectrum of his acting skills, and the supporting cast, even in the small cameos is exemplary.  This is a very fine film that deserves a wide audience - for many, many reasons.

1304758,A9I40WFF40R4,B002ZG9800,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[4, 4]","At long last this film finally makes the theatres. Based on the book by the same name by Steve McVicker, ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" is certainly worth seeing-- if for nothing else-- for the performances of the two lead characters Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor who are star-crossed (?) lovers who meet in prison. Carrey plays Steven Russell, the mastermind behind the events that keep getting the two real-life people in and out of prisons, and McGregor is his lover Phillip Morris. While both of these men are extraordinary in their roles, I found McGregor to be even better than Carrey even though at least one critic says Carrey gave one of the best performances by an actor in any film in 2010. Even though Carrey is good, I never forgot that he was Jim Carrey. McGregor, however, completely convinced me he was the blond slightly fey Phillip Morris.The soundtrack is superb, particularly in a particularly emotional scene when Carrey and McEwan get separated as cell-mates as Nina Simone sings the Beegee hit, ""You don't know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you.""

1304768,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B002ZG9800,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 5]","I Love You, Phillip Morris is the directorial debut of screenwriters John Requa and Glenn Ficarra, who are best known for penning the screenplay to Bad Santa. This film is based on a true story and a book by Steve McVicker that details the exploits of conman Steven Jay Russell. This film is a great example of the idea that truth is stranger than fiction, as many of Steven's cons are outlandish and seemingly exaggerated. Some have rejected the film due to the implausibility of it. If the events here were fictional, it would work against the film. The film opens with ""This really happened...It really did"" and despite how over-the-top and unbelievable much of the film seems, it sticks remarkably close to the facts and makes the proceedings even more fascinating.Jim Carrey plays Steven Jay Russell, who finds out at a young age that he's adopted. Steven goes on to become a small-town police officer with a wife (Leslie Mann) and a young daughter. Quitting the force and moving from Georgia to Texas, Steven decides to come out as gay after a car accident and leaves his wife to move to Florida and live his life the way he wants. Not long after, Steven ends up in prison where he meets Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor) and falls in love. I don't want to reveal any more of the plot, because it unfolds in some surprising and hysterical ways.The screenplay by Requa and Ficarra is terrific, finding a perfect balance of exaggerated humor and genuine emotion. The love story between Steven and Phillip is handled remarkably well for this type of film and is actually rather poignant despite being played for laughs. The two also show skill as directors of both comedy and drama. The film is funny, but it has well-played and effective dramatic elements that never get too heavy. Finding the right tone to tell a complicated story like this isn't easy, but they found exactly how to do it and have succeeded admirably. Nick Urata's simple, but memorable score compliments the tone of the film perfectly. Furthermore, even when dealing with the absurdity of everything they bring a remarkable truthfulness to the story. Steven's wife Debbie is shown to be a sweet, but extremely religious woman, yet they never allow her to become a caricature and show her to be supportive of Steven even after he reveals his sexual orientation to her.I Love You, Phillip Morris is not a typical laugh-a-minute Carrey film, but good comedy is not about how much you laugh but about achieving a particular comedic tone, maintaining it, and seeing it through successfully. I assure you that this film does that quite well. It's one of Carrey's best films and, while it's not immediately apparent, it's one of Carrey's most intricate and eclectic performances in how it achieves a perfect balance of over-the-top comedic energy and grounded pathos. McGregor plays Phillip in a way that makes no secret of his homosexuality due to the voice and mannerisms, yet he's not playing a gay stereotype. It's a sensitive, believable performance that is also intensely likable. Quite simply, the two leads give much better performances than necessary for this type of film.There's an unsung hero in this film that I've noticed is largely unmentioned by reviewers of this film and that is Cleavon, played by newcomer Michael Mandel. I found Cleavon, a black inmate whose ""word is his [expletive] bond,"" to be one of the funniest people in the film. He doesn't have a large role and his funniest scene with his funniest lines occurs offscreen. Despite this, he had me in stitches. I want to see this guy pop up in more films. I Love You, Phillip Morris was delayed endlessly before finally receiving a very limited release. Does it tackle subject matter typical of what's played in mainstream theatres? No, but considering it's so much better, in so many ways, from many blockbuster Hollywood comedies that are simple cash-ins, it's a travesty this film wasn't given the chance for a wider audience.GRADE: A-",5,"A Terrific, Entertaining Comedy",1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,3979,"['Love', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'directorial', 'debut', 'screenwriters', 'John', 'Requa', 'Glenn', 'Ficarra', 'who', 'are', 'best', 'known', 'penning', 'screenplay', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'book', 'Steve', 'McVicker', 'details', 'exploits', 'conman', 'Steven', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'film', 'great', 'example', 'idea', 'truth', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'many', 'Steven', 'cons', 'are', 'outlandish', 'seemingly', 'exaggerated', 'have', 'rejected', 'film', 'due', 'implausibility', 'events', 'here', 'were', 'fictional', 'would', 'work', 'film', 'film', 'really', 'happened', 'really', 'did', 'how', 'over-the-top', 'unbelievable', 'much', 'film', 'remarkably', 'close', 'facts', 'proceedings', 'even', 'more', 'fascinating.Jim', 'Carrey', 'plays', 'Steven', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'who', 'out', 'young', 'age', 'adopted', 'Steven', 'become', 'small-town', 'police', 'officer', 'wife', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'young', 'daughter', 'Quitting', 'force', 'moving', 'Georgia', 'Texas', 'Steven', 'come', 'out', 'gay', 'car', 'accident', 'wife', 'move', 'Florida', 'live', 'life', 'way', 'Not', 'long', 'Steven', 'up', 'prison', 'where', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'more', 'plot', 'surprising', 'hysterical', 'ways.The', 'screenplay', 'Requa', 'Ficarra', 'terrific', 'finding', 'perfect', 'balance', 'exaggerated', 'humor', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'love', 'story', 'Steven', 'Phillip', 'handled', 'remarkably', 'well', 'type', 'film', 'actually', 'rather', 'poignant', 'being', 'played', 'laughs', 'two', 'also', 'show', 'skill', 'directors', 'comedy', 'drama', 'film', 'funny', 'well-played', 'effective', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'never', 'get', 'too', 'heavy', 'Finding', 'right', 'tone', 'tell', 'complicated', 'story', ""n't"", 'easy', 'found', 'exactly', 'how', 'do', 'have', 'succeeded', 'admirably', 'Nick', 'Urata', 'simple', 'memorable', 'score', 'compliments', 'tone', 'film', 'perfectly', 'Furthermore', 'even', 'when', 'dealing', 'absurdity', 'everything', 'bring', 'remarkable', 'truthfulness', 'story', 'Steven', 'wife', 'Debbie', 'shown', 'be', 'sweet', 'extremely', 'religious', 'woman', 'yet', 'never', 'allow', 'become', 'caricature', 'show', 'be', 'supportive', 'Steven', 'even', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'her.I', 'Love', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'not', 'typical', 'laugh-a-minute', 'Carrey', 'film', 'good', 'comedy', 'not', 'how', 'much', 'achieving', 'particular', 'comedic', 'tone', 'maintaining', 'seeing', 'successfully', 'assure', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'one', 'Carrey', 'best', 'films', 'not', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'one', 'Carrey', 'most', 'intricate', 'eclectic', 'performances', 'how', 'perfect', 'balance', 'over-the-top', 'comedic', 'energy', 'grounded', 'pathos', 'McGregor', 'Phillip', 'way', 'secret', 'homosexuality', 'due', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'not', 'playing', 'gay', 'stereotype', 'sensitive', 'believable', 'performance', 'also', 'intensely', 'likable', 'Quite', 'simply', 'two', 'leads', 'give', 'much', 'better', 'performances', 'necessary', 'type', 'film.There', 'unsung', 'hero', 'film', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'largely', 'unmentioned', 'reviewers', 'film', 'Cleavon', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Michael', 'Mandel', 'found', 'Cleavon', 'black', 'inmate', 'word', '[', 'expletive', ']', 'bond', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'people', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'large', 'role', 'funniest', 'scene', 'funniest', 'lines', 'offscreen', 'had', 'stitches', 'want', 'see', 'guy', 'up', 'more', 'films', 'Love', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'was', 'delayed', 'endlessly', 'finally', 'receiving', 'very', 'limited', 'release', 'tackle', 'subject', 'matter', 'typical', 'what', 'played', 'mainstream', 'theatres', 'No', 'considering', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'many', 'blockbuster', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', 'are', 'simple', 'cash-ins', 'travesty', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'chance', 'wider', 'audience.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

I think the problem is that it could not decide what it wanted to be. It started out like a fairly typical off-the-wall Jim Carrey comedy, but in other movies that works because his character is generally likeable, and we side with him. In this film, as his swindles and lies get bigger and bigger, I found it harder and harder to like his character, or to find the humor in it. Plus prison, deception, AIDS, and homosexuality are not easy comedic material anyway. And I think this story got hampered by the fact it was based on a true story. I read some reviews that compared the quirky tone of this to Coen brothers films, but those are generally fiction as far as I know, so they don't have the hindrance of trying to follow the basic outlines of a true story.On the other hand, it is amazing that so many of the prison escapes and cons in this movie actually did occur (google fact vs fiction on I Love Phillip Morris for details.)

I'm normally hesitant to see anything involving Jim Carrey because he basically just plays himself in different clothes every time.  This movie was thankfully a change of pace.  Though you could still tell it was Jim Carrey playing the lead as he is cursed with a very recognizable voice, he is making a genuine effort to not just be himself.  I'd say that the normal rate of his jokes as compared to his other films is cut by 88%...they're still there but they don't dominate and they're relatively appropriate when they do pop up.  Nothing in this film was overdone...if it seemed that way at times, that's because those events actually happened.  Ewan McGregor complimented Mr. Carrey as his jailhouse lover, Phillip Morris.  While some of their dialogue was clearly scripted, especially when they first met, both men soon got into it and things felt much more natural.  If you know anything about the man this film is based on, con artist Steven Jay Russell, the only thing you ought to really be wondering before watching this film is ""which parts of his life are they gonna use?""  There was just no need to embellish details.  The only reason I don't give it that coveted five stars is because you could still clearly tell it was Jim Carrey leading this cast...also because Leslie Mann didn't get more screen time.  Otherwise, this was a very enjoyable film that didn't find itself turning to the cliches of any movie genre but instead just told the story.  I'd reccomend it to anyone.

After reading some reviews, I decided to get in my own 5-stars. Carrey really centers this complex character with terrific sensitivity, as well as his requsite smarm and charm. He is the perfect choice to play this most charismatic character.  It's actually sweet natured, and, regarding the love story aspect, quite profound. Ewan McGregor looked pretty, but it wasn't too much of a stretch for him. He's always reliable. There was very little reference to gay activity, rather a simple desire of 2 people who want to be together. DVD extras are fine; there's an AIDS sub-plot that was left out, only referenced at the end. The ""Sull'aria"" from The Marriage of Figaro, so well used in ""The Shawshank Redemption"", figures in, I think, as a tribute to good prison films.This is not a prison film; it's a love story.

1304793,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002ZG9800,RMurray847,"[10, 11]","Some have suggested that Jim Carrey is poorly cast in the role of Steven Russell, the con artist whose story is told in I LOVE YOU, PHILLIP MORRIS.  It's been said that his performances are too glossy, too on-the-surface for us to believe him as lovestruck and will to do everything and anything for that love.I believe he is IDEALLY cast because of that.  It's true that Carrey is not a classically trained actor...he is just very good at faking emotion (lots of actors do that, of course).  But think about one of his most acclaimed performances, as Andy Kaufmann in MAN ON THE MOON.  Kaufmann was a cipher, a man who deliberately avoided showing his real self by faking one ""public persona"" after another until he had no real persona at all.  Carrey was pitch perfect. In PHILLIP MORRIS, he plays a gay man who initially lives a lie of being straight.  He also joins the police force, not because he wants to fight crime, but as an avenue to getting access to paperwork that will show him who is real mother is.  (And when he finally meets her, she slams the door on him.  He was the middle child, and he wants to know why she kept her first child and her third, but not him.)Eventually, he amicably ends his marriage and perhaps over-compensates by living a lavish Key West lifestyle...flamboyantly gay.  He funds this lifestyle elaborate con games.  The way Carrey plays Russell, we're never sure if Russell is actually a little self-deluded and half believes the cons...or is he just so good at them because there's no real Steven Russell inside the body.  This disconnect from reality allows Carrey to jump everywhere emotionally with great facileness but we also never know when or if what we're seeing is really what Steven Russell is feeling.  I liked this.  Does this man have any self-insight, or is he faking everything...even love?For when he is sent to jail, he falls BIG TIME for a fellow inmate, Phillip Morris (Ewan MacGregor).  The feeling is mutual...or is it.  Certainly, Morris loves Russell.  Does Russell really love Morris, or is he just fulfilled in some way by being loved, and thus will do anything to keep winning the approval.  And does it matter?  They both seem happy with each other.Eventually, both are on the outside, and the question becomes, will Carrey go straight, or will his desire to keep Morris living in the lap of luxury drive him to further cons?  The answer is not hard to guess, and where the film goes from there is too much fun for me to ruin now.In reality, although based on a true story, the entire film lives at an exaggerated, slightly fake level.  It's just so hard to believe Steven Russell did all the things the movie says he did.  (Although apparently he did!).  But it strikes such a rich tone that frankly the film is a blast from beginning to end.  Russell has seemingly endless depths of trickery that he can go to...and Carrey plays the role with gusto.  ""Gusto"" is a word I seldom trot out...but it is SO appropriate here.  He's having a ball playing a guy having a ball.  And MacGregor is a delight as Morris.  He's filmed in such a way that he practically glows.  He's slightly fey, slightly effeminate...but it never struck me as a caricature.  We DO believe he loves Russell.There are plenty of plot hi-jinks throughout the film...including one of the funniest and cleverest prison breaks since SHAWSHANK.  It's certainly quite entertaining just at that level.  But watching these two guys absolutely grab the screen is the enduring pleasure.  And yes, there is plenty of relatively graphic smooching and sex in the film.  I say ""relatively"" because if what we saw was between a man and a woman, we'd scarcely bat an eye.  But because it's two men, some of the physicality is a bit surprising to see in a mainstream movie.  Carrey & MacGregor play it with nary a wink or a hesitation...and thus their relationship has real spark.  It's sexy and fun and romantic.The film is too lightweight and frothy to really be great...but it is a wonderfully good time nonetheless, and should be enjoyed by any adult audience not afraid to see Carrey and MacGregor do some serious smooching.",4,Lightweight but a great deal of fun!

We also agreed that both Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor deserve to win some type of movie awards for their portrayals (Oscar contender?).This movie is so interesting that (in terms of the many successful cons Steven pulled off in the name of love)it can play with your mind to know that it is based on a true story.  The saying that sometimes truth is stranger than fiction does definitely apply to this one of a kind movie. Jim Carrey gives a strong performance as conman Steven Jay Rusell who has a realization that he is gay after a near fatal car accident. Steven happens to be a very highly intelligent man (online sources have his iq measured to be in the 160's) who used his gift towards situations that eventually caused  him to end up in his current situation. However, this movie is worth watching because it paints a humorous and detailed picture of many of the successful and elaborate cons that Steven pulled off for love (which shows Steven's humanity). Ewan McGregor plays Phillip Morris, a man that Steven falls deeply in love with when he meets him in prison. The attraction is mutual, and ends up serving as a backdrop towards explaining why Steven felt like concocting many of the successful schemes that were cleverly executed.  An online article from the guardian has Steven himself admitting that he alone is responsible for his current predicament, although he did this for love. However, watching this movie is very worth it  because it can serve as a cautionary tale towards many compassionate and understanding people of how even someone that is highly intelligent can be steered towards a life of crime. I say this only from a non-judgemental but informative angle of how important it is to refrain from judging someone until you have walked a mile in their shoes.",5,I Love Your  Acting (Jim and Ewan),1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,2112,"['have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'definitely', 'natural', 'connection', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'husband', 'agree', 'chemistry', 'have', 'together', 'movie', 'very', 'hot', 'believable', 'characters', 'Steven', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'also', 'agreed', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'deserve', 'win', 'type', 'movie', 'awards', 'portrayals', 'Oscar', 'contender', '.This', 'movie', 'so', 'interesting', 'terms', 'many', 'successful', 'cons', 'Steven', 'pulled', 'off', 'name', 'love', 'can', 'play', 'mind', 'know', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'saying', 'sometimes', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'definitely', 'apply', 'one', 'kind', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'strong', 'performance', 'conman', 'Steven', 'Jay', 'Rusell', 'who', 'realization', 'gay', 'near', 'fatal', 'car', 'accident', 'Steven', 'be', 'very', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'man', 'online', 'sources', 'have', 'iq', 'measured', 'be', '160', 'who', 'used', 'gift', 'towards', 'situations', 'eventually', 'caused', 'end', 'up', 'current', 'situation', 'However', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'humorous', 'detailed', 'picture', 'many', 'successful', 'elaborate', 'cons', 'Steven', 'pulled', 'off', 'love', 'Steven', 'humanity', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'man', 'Steven', 'deeply', 'love', 'when', 'prison', 'attraction', 'mutual', 'up', 'serving', 'backdrop', 'explaining', 'why', 'Steven', 'felt', 'concocting', 'many', 'successful', 'schemes', 'were', 'cleverly', 'executed', 'online', 'article', 'guardian', 'Steven', 'admitting', 'alone', 'responsible', 'current', 'predicament', 'did', 'love', 'However', 'watching', 'movie', 'very', 'worth', 'can', 'serve', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'towards', 'many', 'compassionate', 'understanding', 'people', 'how', 'even', 'someone', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'can', 'be', 'steered', 'life', 'crime', 'say', 'only', 'non-judgemental', 'informative', 'angle', 'how', 'important', 'refrain', 'judging', 'someone', 'have', 'walked', 'mile', 'shoes']",N/A

After a series of cons and theft lands him in jail Russell meets Morris and it's love at first site.  The lengths Russell goes to in order to make Morris happy land him in more and more trouble with the law.  This movie is very, very funny, but because of the subject matter won't be seen by that many people.  There are a few pretty graphic scenes in this, with the worst being in the first fifteen minutes, but the fact that Carrey and McGregor play gay lovers the same way a man and a woman would (Carrey and McGregor have more chemistry on screen then Depp and Jolie did) it will lose a lot of viewers who won't give it a chance.  This is Carrey's best performance since playing Andy Kaufman in ""Man On The Moon"", and again I think because this movie wasn't widely released because of people being frightened of the subject matter he did not get the recognition he deserved.  I have not seen ""Brokeback Mountain"" so I can't compare this to that, but I really enjoyed this movie.  This movie is a very funny comedy, but will only be seen as a ""Gay"" movie and won't get the viewers it deserves.  That is a real shame.

1304804,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002ZG9800,Turfseer,"[4, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3 1/2 starsThis is a movie that I decided to watch twice as I was initially confused as to Jim Carrey's take on the character he plays--Steven Russell--the gay con artist who's now serving a life sentence in a Texas prison for a series of multiple con jobs which almost puts Bernie Madoff to shame (not quite in terms of monies embezzled but for the sheer style and inventiveness of the con jobs he pulls off). I found 'I love you Phillip Morris' a far more convincing portrait of gay characters than 'Brokeback Mountain' since the film's creators, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, appear to have no interest in promoting the dubious (and politically correct) stance that gay people in general have been perennially oppressed from time immemorial. Here, Carrey as Russell makes it quite clear that he's not ashamed of his gayness one bit. In perhaps the most surprising and clever scene in the entire film, Russell, enthusiastically engages in sexual intercourse and we expect it'll be a repeat of an earlier scene with his wife. But lo and behold, as the camera pulls back, we find that Russell is having anal sex with a man, as he proclaims via a voice-over that ""I'm gay, gay, gay!"".Not only should Carrey be commended for taking on the role of a gay person who has a real ego and no apparent guilt feelings about being gay but for also portraying a character who is almost completely amoral. Thus Russell is shown to be a rather complex character--not your usual gay 'victim' but rather an unrepentant victimizer! When Russell meets Phillip Morris in prison for the first time, he shows off his sensitive side by advising Phillip on how he can obtain social services for a critically ill AIDS patient Phillip has been trying to help. Later he sends some of his ill gotten gains to his ex-wife and daughter and seems genuinely interested in their welfare. But Russell is also an obsessive-compulsive character whose love for material things prevents him from feeling real empathy for others. Russell is like a pathological gambler who can never stop placing one more bet. And even his lover, Phillip, is simply one additional object he must reclaim, after it becomes clear that Phillip is no longer interested in him and his bizarre and brazen schemes to obtain Phillip's release, are no longer working.Carrey's take on Russell is always pretty much sympathetic. Some viewers may be put off by the elevation of a con man to such a sympathetic status but if Spielberg could do it in 'Catch me if you can', why can't it be done for a gay character here? The first third of the picture, however, is more an affectionate ribbing of a certain kind of gay lifestyle, than a more serious dissection of a certain kind of asocial, pathological behavior. Carrey goes a little too far into making Russell seem like a buffoon in the scene where he confronts his birth mother. The attempt at black humor when Russell continually advises a new inmate that the only way to get ahead in the prison environment is to perform oral sex, falls flat as the subject matter is more tragic than comic.The film really picks up as it examines Steven's and Phillip's relationship in prison. Ewan McGregor is excellent as Russell's boy toy and even displays a dark side (similar to Russell) when he approves of Russell's paying off an inmate in another cell block to beat up another inmate in their own cell block, whose been keeping Phillip awake every night by shrieking in a continuously loud and repetitive manner.Carrey is in best form when he poses as a lawyer and gains Phillip's release and then lucks out when a Judge approves a judgment for a friend of Phillip in civil court. Russell acquires untoward riches by defrauding a medical management firm after being hired as their chief financial officer.After Russell's scheme is uncovered, not only is he jailed but Phillip is arrested as an accomplice. This after Russell promised Phillip that his behavior at the medical management firm was above board. As we learn at the end of the film, Phillip actually does about seven years in prison as a result of Russell's machinations. So it's quite understandable that Phillip wants nothing to do with him by the film's end.For those who find that Russell's life sentence is excessive, consider this: Russell puts Phillip through unconscionable emotional pain by allowing him to believe that he's died of AIDS. Then he has the audacity to pull yet but another scheme, posing as an attorney again, and once again place the man he supposedly is in love with in jeopardy. Phillip slapping Russell in the face is wholly justified. It becomes clear that Russell's pathological behavior will never end and that promises to change are insincere. That perhaps is why it's best that Russell be incarcerated for the rest of his days is the right move (although 23 hours in solitary confinement may indeed be ""cruel and unusual punishment"").Ewan McGregor as Phillip has the best speech in the film when he speaks with Russell over the phone, believing that he's about to die of AIDS. He acknowledges in his own sick way, Russell did indeed love him but he could no longer maintain a relationship with him, as he knew that Russell would return to his manipulative and self-destructive ways.'I love you Phillip Morris' is one of those films worth viewing more than once. You'll find that it's a cautionary tale about naivety (Morris) and self-deception (Russell). Jim Carrey is not always successful in his portrayal of Russell, who may come off a tad bit too sympathetic. Nonetheless, Carrey must be praised for taking on the difficult role of an amoral and charismatic con man.",3,Carrey takes on difficult role as charismatic and amoral gay con artist,1307318400,"06 6,
