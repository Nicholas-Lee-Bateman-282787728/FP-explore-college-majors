Even the version of ""Georgia"" is a bit bland. The CD from the film ""Ray"" is great, by the way - it has a lot of great Ray Charles - the original recordings. I'm also looking forward to another DVD of Ray Charles that I bought - haven't seen that yet, though.",3,"A great artist, but the concert is a bit too bland for me.",1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,395,"['sort', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'use', 'word', 'blah', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', ""n't"", ""'d"", 'prefer', 'see/hear', 'again', 'Even', 'version', 'Georgia', 'bit', 'bland', 'CD', 'film', 'Ray', 'great', 'way', 'lot', 'great', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'original', 'recordings', ""'m"", 'also', 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'bought', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet']",N/A

After watching it, I wonder if they did it on purpose.Ray Charles is in great spirits at this concert but certainly not in great voice.The orchestra is great and Ray could certainly still play the piano just fine but his singing is pretty bad.Diane Shur, who guest stars on two songs is very good but if you're going to get this DVD for her, you might as well get her own DVD.Anyway, get some other Ray Charles DVD instead.",2,Don't bother,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,504,"['people', 'have', 'complained', 'sound', 'turned', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'DVD', 'watching', 'wonder', 'did', 'purpose.Ray', 'Charles', 'great', 'spirits', 'concert', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'voice.The', 'orchestra', 'great', 'Ray', 'could', 'certainly', 'still', 'play', 'piano', 'just', 'fine', 'singing', 'pretty', 'bad.Diane', 'Shur', 'who', 'guest', 'stars', 'two', 'songs', 'very', 'good', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'DVD', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'own', 'DVD.Anyway', 'get', 'other', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'DVD', 'instead']",N/A

There's no question or deninement saying about this live concert taken here in Miami, Florida. Ray Charles packed up with a real live and massive orchestra to bring all the goods to use. He also at one hand plays alto sax on one number. Can't you believe when you read his biographys that he plays both alto sax, clarinet and trumpet in addition to the piano? What's shocking to me is they never show another side of him playing the sax either on the documentaryGenius of Soul [VHS] or the 2004 movieRay (Full Screen Edition).There's still not much discussing about it, but it has to be heard today. If you hear R&B;, country, blues, funk, jazz, rock, its all right here by the guidance of Brother Ray under the direction of the orchestra conducted by Victor Vanacore. He also sits down a few duets with the legendary Diane Schuur which is beautiful. If you love strong music with a melange of classical, jazz, opera, easy-listening and other genres mixed together in one. Get this because it helps me and it can for you too.Also check out other concerts that are amazing too that been re-released on DVd and/or never made to DVD yet:Ray Charles- Live 1991: A Romantic Evening at the McCallum Theatre [VHS],The Willie Nelson Special With Special Guest Ray Charles,Ray Charles Live - In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony,Ray Charles: Soul of the Holy Land - The Lost Concert.",5,A true dynamite concert with a real bang!,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,1576,"['became', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'fan', 'growing', 'up', '90s', 'soon', 'realize', 'one', 'nearly', 'changed', 'life', 'one', 'favorite', 'taped', 'concerts', 'ever', 'first', 'premiered', 'PBS', 'question', 'deninement', 'saying', 'live', 'concert', 'taken', 'here', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'packed', 'up', 'real', 'live', 'massive', 'orchestra', 'bring', 'goods', 'use', 'also', 'one', 'hand', 'alto', 'sax', 'one', 'number', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', 'read', 'biographys', 'alto', 'sax', 'clarinet', 'trumpet', 'addition', 'piano', 'What', 'shocking', 'never', 'show', 'side', 'playing', 'sax', 'documentaryGenius', 'Soul', '[', 'VHS', ']', '2004', 'movieRay', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'still', 'not', 'much', 'discussing', 'be', 'heard', 'today', 'hear', 'R', 'B', 'country', 'blues', 'funk', 'jazz', 'rock', 'right', 'here', 'guidance', 'Brother', 'Ray', 'direction', 'orchestra', 'conducted', 'Victor', 'Vanacore', 'also', 'down', 'few', 'duets', 'legendary', 'Diane', 'Schuur', 'beautiful', 'love', 'strong', 'music', 'melange', 'classical', 'jazz', 'opera', 'easy-listening', 'other', 'genres', 'mixed', 'together', 'one', 'Get', 'can', 'too.Also', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'concerts', 'are', 'amazing', 'too', 'been', 're-released', 'DVd', 'and/or', 'never', 'made', 'DVD', 'yet', 'Ray', 'Charles-', 'Live', '1991', 'Romantic', 'Evening', 'McCallum', 'Theatre', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Special', 'Special', 'Guest', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Live', 'Concert', 'Edmonton', 'Symphony', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Soul', 'Holy', 'Land', 'Lost', 'Concert']",N/A

Without them, forget it....like ""Hit the road Jack"" wasn't even there. He did some of his famous tunes, notably the one he received most honors for(Georgia on My Mind), including the president of the U.S. but you could hardly hear him. He did one number with Diane Schurr which I thought was terrible.Had he some backup singers like the old days, I would have liked it 90% more, but he didn't.Still, I'm glad to have it, but just as a souvenir. I couldn't even watch more than 3 or 4 tunes. But if you're expecting the old Ray Charles, forget it.
