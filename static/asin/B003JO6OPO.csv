I have always been impressed with Hallmark's ability to present life past and present with tenderness and reality in its movies.  I am a substance abuse counselor who uses this excellent depiction of the disease concept of addiction, the dysfunctional family unit and codependent behaviors, and the hope for a better life once addicted individuals reach a powerless and unmanageable bottom and become willing to make a powerful and spiritual change in their lives and the way family members can better understand addiction and its damaging effect on families in order for the family to begin its own healing process through Al-Anon started by Lois Wilson.

1347620,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B003JO6OPO,Thomas M. Sipos,"[3, 4]","This past decade has not been good to Winona Ryder.  I loved LOST SOULS (2000), but critics didn't.  After that Ryder appeared in the dreadful AUTUMN IN NEW YORK, and there followed many awful indie films and unfunny comedies, with Ryder often cast in small roles as an unlikeable, nasty, or crazy woman (SEX AND DEATH 101, THE TEN, THE INFORMERS).  Although THE PRIVATE LIVES OF PIPPA LEE was a decent film, once again, Ryder had a small role as the nasty Crazy Girl.WHEN LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH returns Ryder to her 1990s screen persona of a smart, strong, idealistic, independent yet devoted woman.  Her Lois Wilson character in this film resembles Ryder characters from 1969, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, and LITTLE WOMEN.The story is engaging.  I don't normally like these ""disease of the week"" films, but WHEN LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH maintained my interest, partially because it was based on a true story, its set decor effectively recreated its 1917-1950s period setting, and because the rest of the cast and crew also did a great job.  (Although I mostly got this because I've been a Ryder fan ever since I saw LOST SOULS.)Ryder did a great job as a Crazy Girl in GIRL, INTERRUPTED, but since then she's been too often typecast as The Crazy.  I've not seen BLACK SWAN (I normally wait for the DVD), but I hear Ryder plays another Crazy.I hope WHEN LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH, rather than BLACK SWAN, will inspire her future roles.  I think most Ryder fans would prefer to see her in more of the former than the latter.",5,best Winona Ryder film in a decade,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,1502,"['past', 'decade', 'not', 'been', 'good', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'loved', 'LOST', 'SOULS', '2000', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'Ryder', 'appeared', 'dreadful', 'AUTUMN', 'IN', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'there', 'followed', 'many', 'awful', 'indie', 'films', 'unfunny', 'comedies', 'Ryder', 'often', 'cast', 'small', 'roles', 'unlikeable', 'nasty', 'crazy', 'woman', 'SEX', 'AND', 'DEATH', '101', 'THE', 'TEN', 'THE', 'INFORMERS', 'THE', 'PRIVATE', 'LIVES', 'OF', 'PIPPA', 'LEE', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'Ryder', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'nasty', 'Crazy', 'Girl.WHEN', 'LOVE', 'IS', 'NOT', 'ENOUGH', 'Ryder', '1990s', 'screen', 'persona', 'smart', 'strong', 'idealistic', 'independent', 'yet', 'devoted', 'woman', 'Lois', 'Wilson', 'character', 'film', 'Ryder', 'characters', '1969', 'BRAM', 'STOKER', 'DRACULA', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN.The', 'story', 'engaging', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'disease', 'week', 'films', 'WHEN', 'LOVE', 'IS', 'NOT', 'ENOUGH', 'maintained', 'interest', 'partially', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'set', 'decor', 'effectively', 'recreated', '1917-1950s', 'period', 'setting', 'rest', 'cast', 'crew', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'mostly', 'got', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Ryder', 'fan', 'ever', 'saw', 'LOST', 'SOULS', 'Ryder', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Crazy', 'Girl', 'GIRL', 'INTERRUPTED', 'then', 'been', 'too', 'often', 'typecast', 'Crazy', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'BLACK', 'SWAN', 'normally', 'wait', 'DVD', 'hear', 'Ryder', 'Crazy.I', 'hope', 'WHEN', 'LOVE', 'IS', 'NOT', 'ENOUGH', 'rather', 'BLACK', 'SWAN', 'will', 'inspire', 'future', 'roles', 'think', 'most', 'Ryder', 'fans', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'more', 'former', 'latter']",N/A
