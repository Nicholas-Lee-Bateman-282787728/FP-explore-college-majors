1013953,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000HEWEE4,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 8]","As many people from cities by The Great Lakes know, the lake effect can change with variable winds and bring snow squalls and rains unexpectedly.  The winds of change are presented in a relationship that straddles a time barrier, a time warp that is bridged by a magic mailbox where messages are transported back and forth between two residents of a specially designed ""lake house"".  One resident is a Chicago architect, Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), whose father was the architect of the stunning, but idiosyncratic glass ""lake house"" on ""stilts"".  He lives there in 2004.  Kate Forster, a resident doctor, lives at the residence in 2006.  She moves out, but leaves a message in the mailbox for the new owner to forward her mail to her new address.  He intercepts the note two years earlier and leaves her a note that her new address is under construction, and her reference to animal tracks left on the residence aren't apparent.  Both are curious by the discrepancies of the other's notes.  His letters have the heading 2004; her letters have the heading 2006.  Then a mysterious but lively exchange of letters takes place.  They address these concerns, and the movie makes us take some leaps to bridge the incredulity gap.  (Wouldn't most people dismiss the other as wacko with some sort of anomoly?)  Fortunately, even though there is enough effort by the audience to suspend disbelief, there is no magic Post Office actually delivering the mail.  Somehow they believe one another and fall in love.There are some connections made besides the mailbox over the two year communication gap:  One is the same resident dog who is present for both owners; the other is a copy of Kate's favorite book, Jane Austin's 'Persuasion'.  The former never forgets an owner, so his straying provides a meeting between the two during a time she wouldn't know the context of the letters in 2004.  It is her birthday, and her trusting, live-in boyfriend invites the stranger neatly enough when his dog runs to the new residence they share.  The event turns into a date that becomes awkward upon her boyfriend's discovery.  An emotional connection is made, even though Kate thinks of him as a newcomer in her life.  The book provides a tangible presence and a fine allusion to another story about an old-fashioned courtship where the protagonists wait for a romance tested over time.Alex has two barriers to straddle.  He struggles with a hard-to-please architect mentor father who in Alex's own words, ""...knew how to make a house, but not a home.""  The emotional baggage is telling between himself and his father, especially when his dad's health heads south.  (And all of this is presented well with the friendly sibling rivalry with his brother, Henry.)  But the biggest barrier is trying to schedule a date with the future Kate.  He goes to Chicago's best restaurant to make a date two years in advance with her and shares his plan in a letter.  He does his best to keep the engagement, yet she is stood up, and from there she abandons hope of them ever connecting.  That is until she discovers the reason for his failure, and this leads to a chance... a chance that one can alter events and change the future.'The Lake House' is a pleasing and manipulative romantic movie.  It plays upon all of our buttons.  Relying on narrated letters, the movie draws upon films like 'Sleepless in Seattle' and its follow-up, 'You've Got Mail'.  Romance mainly emanates from the longing presented, and the narration of the correspondence crossing the two-year distance for both would-be lovers.  As languid as some of the scenes linger on, the resolution is strong enough to recommend this stylish and heartwarming flick about love that is meant to bridge the gap of space and time.  Just like ""the lake effect,"" 'The Lake House' sneaks up on one and provides powerful changes that neatly blow away the debris and provide a clearer day.",3,Lake Effect with a Time Warp,1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,3909,"['many', 'people', 'cities', 'Great', 'Lakes', 'know', 'lake', 'effect', 'can', 'change', 'variable', 'winds', 'bring', 'snow', 'squalls', 'rains', 'unexpectedly', 'winds', 'change', 'are', 'presented', 'relationship', 'time', 'barrier', 'time', 'warp', 'bridged', 'magic', 'mailbox', 'where', 'messages', 'are', 'transported', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'residents', 'specially', 'designed', 'lake', 'house', 'One', 'resident', 'Chicago', 'architect', 'Alex', 'Wyler', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'father', 'was', 'architect', 'stunning', 'idiosyncratic', 'glass', 'lake', 'house', 'stilts', 'there', '2004', 'Kate', 'Forster', 'resident', 'doctor', 'residence', '2006', 'out', 'message', 'mailbox', 'new', 'owner', 'forward', 'mail', 'new', 'address', 'note', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'note', 'new', 'address', 'construction', 'reference', 'animal', 'tracks', 'left', 'residence', 'are', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'are', 'curious', 'discrepancies', 'other', 'notes', 'letters', 'have', 'heading', '2004', 'letters', 'have', 'heading', '2006', 'Then', 'mysterious', 'lively', 'exchange', 'letters', 'place', 'address', 'concerns', 'movie', 'take', 'leaps', 'bridge', 'incredulity', 'gap', 'Would', ""n't"", 'most', 'people', 'dismiss', 'other', 'wacko', 'sort', 'anomoly', 'Fortunately', 'even', 'enough', 'effort', 'audience', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'magic', 'Post', 'Office', 'actually', 'delivering', 'mail', 'Somehow', 'believe', 'one', 'fall', 'love.There', 'are', 'connections', 'made', 'mailbox', 'two', 'year', 'communication', 'gap', 'One', 'same', 'resident', 'dog', 'who', 'present', 'owners', 'other', 'copy', 'Kate', 'favorite', 'book', 'Jane', 'Austin', ""'Persuasion"", 'former', 'never', 'owner', 'straying', 'meeting', 'two', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'context', 'letters', '2004', 'birthday', 'trusting', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'stranger', 'neatly', 'enough', 'when', 'dog', 'new', 'residence', 'share', 'event', 'date', 'awkward', 'boyfriend', 'discovery', 'emotional', 'connection', 'made', 'even', 'Kate', 'thinks', 'newcomer', 'life', 'book', 'tangible', 'presence', 'fine', 'allusion', 'story', 'old-fashioned', 'courtship', 'where', 'protagonists', 'wait', 'romance', 'tested', 'time.Alex', 'two', 'barriers', 'straddle', 'hard-to-please', 'architect', 'mentor', 'father', 'who', 'Alex', 'own', 'words', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'house', 'not', 'home', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'telling', 'father', 'especially', 'when', 'dad', 'health', 'heads', 'south', 'presented', 'well', 'friendly', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'brother', 'Henry', 'biggest', 'barrier', 'trying', 'schedule', 'date', 'future', 'Kate', 'Chicago', 'best', 'restaurant', 'make', 'date', 'two', 'years', 'advance', 'shares', 'plan', 'letter', 'best', 'keep', 'engagement', 'stood', 'up', 'abandons', 'hope', 'ever', 'connecting', 'reason', 'failure', 'chance', 'chance', 'one', 'can', 'alter', 'events', 'change', 'future', 'Lake', 'House', 'pleasing', 'manipulative', 'romantic', 'movie', 'buttons', 'Relying', 'narrated', 'letters', 'movie', 'films', ""'Sleepless"", 'Seattle', 'follow-up', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'Romance', 'mainly', 'longing', 'presented', 'narration', 'correspondence', 'crossing', 'two-year', 'distance', 'would-be', 'lovers', 'As', 'languid', 'scenes', 'linger', 'resolution', 'strong', 'enough', 'recommend', 'stylish', 'heartwarming', 'flick', 'love', 'meant', 'bridge', 'gap', 'space', 'time', 'Just', 'lake', 'effect', 'Lake', 'House', 'up', 'one', 'powerful', 'changes', 'neatly', 'blow', 'away', 'debris', 'provide', 'clearer', 'day']",N/A
1013954,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000HEWEE4,A Customer,"[11, 18]","Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are good friends so it's understandable they wanted to act together again. In the Lake House they have more chemistry than ever, but surely they could have found better material than this as their vehicle. The Lake Houses is so full of plot holes, so full of cheesy dialogue, and the characters are so underwritten and insipid that the film ends up a weird, flaggingly paced caricature of itself.You really have to suspend disbelief as Alex an architect (Keanu Reeves) and Kate a doctor (Sandra Bullock) actually meet. Both live in a contemporary glass walled house on the picaresque shore of Lake Michigan - he in 2004 and she in 2006 when they begin exchanging correspondence via the house's mailbox. The fact that their letters are traveling through time doesn't seem to bother them.Eventually, they realize that they're meant to be together, but alas what are they to do? They're both stranded in their respective time periods. Alex attempts to seek out Kate's 2004 counterpart when she's tied to a dutiful beau (Dylan Walsh). Mostly, however their liaison relies on split-screen wizardry and fluent editing (by Alejandro Brodersohn and Lynzee Klingman). For her part, Kate waits patiently for Alex to ""catch up"" to her.Admittedly, The Lake House is beautiful to look at and Sandra and Keanu are absolutely lovely, the spark that ignited between them in Speed still burns, but there's not much edge to their relationship - it's all rather sweet and adorable rather than sexy or passionate. But the major problem with The Lake House is that there's a plot turn in the first act that most savvy viewers will see coming that ruins any suspense for the rest of the story.As Alex and Kate Bullock and Reeves phone in carefully muted performances, in fact they're so subdued that they seem to drift through the story in a daze, as if they don't really care what happens. Even their few scenes together are extremely soft, slow and shamelessly sentimental. Despite the fluid cinematography, editing and music, these short scenes prevent the film from flowing.There's also several nagging plot points - including a superfluous subplot involving Alex's dying father (Christopher Plummer) - that make it almost impossible to suspend disbelief. And how can the lake house supposedly built with pillars and glass have an enclosed attic?  Never mind; trying to find logic in this film will drive you crazy along with a script that jumps around in time so much that you're never quite sure when you're in 2004 or 2006.On the plus side, Agresti's direction is lyrical and textured; giving the film a warm rhythm that just about makes up for its lack of pacing. The movie also highlights the urban beauty of Chicago, making the best of the city's surrounds. And I guess it's nice, after all this time, to see Reeves and Bullock together again, and even though they ground The Lake House and allowing us to overlook many of its contrivances, I'm still not sure why they chose this kind of movie to star in.

1013955,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000HEWEE4,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[2, 4]","Warning: SLIGHT Spoilers Ahead!!!The best part of the movie was the very end of it. For once, Sandra's character, who was a doctor at a local hospital is actually happy, and her and Keanu's character's souls are together! But does it only last 2 years and then he's killed? I was confused about that as well as a few other aspects of the movie.The movie itself was alright. I liked how two strangers wrote each other, taking their time to get to know each other, and ultimately feeling emotionally attached to each other by the end. I loved the emotional parts where Keanu's character pretty much lost it. Before that, he even admitted to his friend that she was, ""The realest thing I know.""About 20 minutes or so afterwards, you see Sandra's character in tears because Keanu's brother informs him that he is dead. She rushes out of the office, down the steps and out into the city to find him. She eventually does (how, I don't know) and eventually, they are together. FINALLY.Would I re-watch this? Probably not. It wasn't exciting enough. But I did however like the part where Keanu and Sandra's characters met for the second time, and they were talking and stuff and ended up having to cover up a kiss they had when some girl who's into Keanu's character and Sandra's mate come back into the picture. Sandra makes up a lie something like, ""He was telling me about the lake house...""LOL.

Suffice it to say that the script helps keep things tight, yet there's enough space and light to permit us to engage with these two otherwise fairly stereotypical characters. Lots of nice visual counterpoints and use of color to echo the plot developments, and all kudos to the cameraman (or people) and to the director, who makes this a very sumpuous feast. The love story is of course pure Hollywood schmalz so don't look for profundity, but if you want a nice date movie then this certainly fills the bill. My only complaint is that in the end the need for box-office approval mandated the Great American Happy Ending, which was somewhat out of keeping with the rest of the movie. If they'd been brave, they'd have allowed the plot to keep the two lovers separate in the end - but who cares about brave when you need to sell tickets reliably?  Americans absolutely hate downbeat endings so of course in the best tradition of Uncle Walt this has the happy-ever-after that middle America needs.

Through the intervention of a 'magic mailbox' the two begin to correspond, and eventually fall in love.Throughout the course of the film Keanu slowly starts to interact with Sandra's earlier self, until he finally catches up with her in 2006.

In defense of the time silliness, I would say that first of all, the difference in time is only 2 years which makes the whole thing much more plausible. It doesn't require actual time travel for the characters to be together or be more or less the same age. Second, the plot device involving time doesn't get sillier and sillier as the movie goes on. It ends up being one small implausible aspect in an otherwise believable movie. As far as the actual romantic aspect of the movie goes, I would say there is definite chemistry, but the whole thing falls just short of being great. It's watchable and you really want the two main characters to get together somehow. Somehow the whole thing just seems to lack a bit of spark here and there.

1013972,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000HEWEE4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","A few years back a little film called `Frequency' was released.  That said film has pretty much the same synopsis or idea behind it as `The Lake House' with one major difference; `Frequency' actually takes the time to explain what is going on.  I waited the entire length of the movie for some kind of explanation, some kind of reason for the `strange' occurrences but they gave me nothing.  That's not to say that deep down `The Lake House' isn't a sweet little film, for it does have its moments but in the end it's nothing spectacular and definitely not the brilliant film some would have you think it is.  The one thing that this movie does have going for it is its two main stars.  I'm not a fan of Keanu in the least, I feel he's wooden and stiff and uninteresting as an actor, but here he comes alive when paired with Bullock, who just dominates this film.  It's as if Sandra brings out the actor in Reeves.The film follows Kate Forster; former tenant to a beautiful lake house, as she starts to correspond with its next tenant only to find out that it's not the `next' tenant she's writing to.  Kate leaves a note in the mail box as she leaves welcoming the next tenant to their new home and asking that her mail be forwarded to her new address if it happens to show up.  Alex Wyler is the man who receives the letter, but he's living two years in the past.  The two of them start writing to one another and eventually fall in love and want to meet but of course there have to be some obstacles to overcome first.I have a couple petty issues with this film aside from my big complaint about the lack of explaining the goings on.  I enjoyed the chemistry between both Sandra and Keanu but the writer of the script seemed to forget that they are writing letters, not talking on the telephone, and so I couldn't help but become irritated with the conversations they had with one another which, according to the plot, could have only happened if they were standing in front of the mailbox writing short sentences one at a time.  I know it's petty but it was just annoying to me.  The outcome is very predictable as well.  I knew the minute Kate was stood up at the restaurant what was going on (or what happened) but I guess that is petty as well since most movies nowadays are pretty predictable.  I felt that a lot of the dialog was cheesy to the point of cringing, but I get the feeling that's what they were going for, at least I hope it was intentional since it would be pretty sad if the writers actually thought it was good.Surprisingly, like I mentioned, Keanu Reeves is far from bad here.  He actually was enjoyable to watch.  Sandra Bullock is almost always a doll to me and so I really enjoyed her performance, although it was far from a favorite of mine.  Christopher Plummer is good as Alex's domineering father but the very talented Shohreh Aghdashloo is all but wasted here as Kate's fellow doctor Anna.  Other supporting players like Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Willeke van Ammelrooy and Dylan Walsh (Sandra is making her way through the `Nip/Tuck' men huh) are decent but not outstanding given their little screen time.In the end I don't know if I can really recommend `The Lake House' with a straight face.  It's not that I feel it was a horrible film; it just wasn't that great of a film either.  The script was interesting but leaves the audience hanging at the end, waiting for that climactic explanation that just never comes.  If you're a fan of Bullock's or (god forbid) a fan of Reeves then by all means see this movie, but if your looking for a really good movie then there are plenty of better choices ahead of you.",2,Lacks that punch that could have made it palatable...,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,3638,"['few', 'years', 'back', 'little', 'film', 'called', 'Frequency', 'was', 'released', 'said', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'synopsis', 'idea', 'behind', 'Lake', 'House', 'one', 'major', 'difference', 'Frequency', 'actually', 'time', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'waited', 'entire', 'length', 'movie', 'kind', 'explanation', 'kind', 'reason', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'gave', 'nothing', 'not', 'say', 'deep', 'Lake', 'House', ""n't"", 'sweet', 'little', 'film', 'have', 'moments', 'end', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'definitely', 'not', 'brilliant', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'have', 'going', 'two', 'main', 'stars', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Keanu', 'least', 'feel', 'wooden', 'stiff', 'uninteresting', 'actor', 'here', 'alive', 'when', 'paired', 'Bullock', 'who', 'just', 'film', 'Sandra', 'out', 'actor', 'Reeves.The', 'film', 'Kate', 'Forster', 'former', 'tenant', 'beautiful', 'lake', 'house', 'correspond', 'next', 'tenant', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'next', 'tenant', 'writing', 'Kate', 'note', 'mail', 'box', 'welcoming', 'next', 'tenant', 'new', 'home', 'asking', 'mail', 'be', 'forwarded', 'new', 'address', 'show', 'up', 'Alex', 'Wyler', 'man', 'who', 'letter', 'living', 'two', 'years', 'past', 'two', 'start', 'writing', 'one', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'want', 'meet', 'course', 'there', 'have', 'be', 'obstacles', 'overcome', 'first.I', 'have', 'couple', 'petty', 'issues', 'film', 'aside', 'big', 'complaint', 'lack', 'explaining', 'goings', 'enjoyed', 'chemistry', 'Sandra', 'Keanu', 'writer', 'script', 'seemed', 'forget', 'are', 'writing', 'letters', 'not', 'talking', 'telephone', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'become', 'irritated', 'conversations', 'had', 'one', 'according', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'happened', 'were', 'standing', 'front', 'mailbox', 'writing', 'short', 'sentences', 'one', 'time', 'know', 'petty', 'was', 'just', 'annoying', 'outcome', 'very', 'predictable', 'well', 'knew', 'minute', 'Kate', 'was', 'stood', 'up', 'restaurant', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'happened', 'guess', 'petty', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'are', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'felt', 'lot', 'dialog', 'was', 'cheesy', 'point', 'cringing', 'get', 'feeling', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'least', 'hope', 'was', 'intentional', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'sad', 'writers', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'good.Surprisingly', 'mentioned', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'far', 'bad', 'here', 'actually', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'almost', 'always', 'doll', 'so', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'was', 'far', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'good', 'Alex', 'domineering', 'father', 'very', 'talented', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'wasted', 'here', 'Kate', 'fellow', 'doctor', 'Anna', 'Other', 'supporting', 'players', 'Ebon', 'Moss-Bachrach', 'Willeke', 'van', 'Ammelrooy', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'Sandra', 'making', 'way', 'Nip/Tuck', 'men', 'huh', 'are', 'decent', 'not', 'outstanding', 'given', 'little', 'screen', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'really', 'recommend', 'Lake', 'House', 'straight', 'face', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'horrible', 'film', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'either', 'script', 'was', 'interesting', 'audience', 'hanging', 'end', 'waiting', 'climactic', 'explanation', 'just', 'never', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Bullock', 'god', 'forbid', 'fan', 'Reeves', 'then', 'means', 'see', 'movie', 'looking', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'then', 'are', 'plenty', 'better', 'choices', 'ahead']",N/A

For those men among you that aren't afraid of admitting that you enjoy romance, this a great movie to share with your loved one.This is one of the best new movies I've watched in a long time, because it was so un-Hollywood. The way this movie was directed reminded me of some of the dialogue in the movie. In one scene, Alex's father talks about how architects need to know their environment, they have pay attention to the light. To me it seemed Alejandro Agresti was paying attention to the environment. He wasn't just filming a movie, he was creating this movie the same way an architect can create beauty out of wood, glass and steel.This story has a paranormal element that can throw some viewers. This is not a movie about time travel. The story is about two alternative realities, and how the characters can't travel to each other (at least without Alex waiting for time to pass).But, more importantly, this story is really just a romance. To me it seemed as if the creators didn't even want the alternative realities to detract from that romance. They could have had more pizzaz than a mailbox flag flipping up and down to show two alternative realities. But, why have drastically shifting images and sounds like The Butterfly Effect did, when simple worked?Of course, there were some special effects that were interesting. But, this movie didn't have that Hollywood glitz that distracts from the human element. The Lake House was calm and quiet and romantic. It's hard to find that in the movie industry these days.I'm pretty sure that it was the direct, Alejandro Agresti, that played the guy with the breath freshener on the train. It was my favorite scene. I laughed so hard I had to back up and watch all the dialogue I missed.

The written word is brought to life by Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, two people who have a quiet and mesmerizing way of delivering their lines.

How is it that the little flag of the mailbox moves up and down by itself? Or that the two main characters have the same dog? And with the lakehouse as the backdrop, well, you can't beat that.Bullock plays Kate, a woman living in 2006, who has just begun a new job and moved out of the lakehouse into an apartment. She leaves a letter at the lakehouse for the new tennant. But who should receive this letter other than Alex, a man who is living in the lakehouse in 2004. They begin a letter-writing courtship, questioning the possibilities of how something so strange and wonderful can be happening and whether or not they can manipulate time in order for them to one day be together. While it seems easy enough (all she has to do is tell him to meet her in two years at so and so location), time and circumstances are not always on their side.The big question is will they or won't they, and of course, I cannot reveal this. What kind of reviewer would I be?! All I can say is that lovers of romantic comedies should not miss out, nor should fans of the written word. It's important to forget the space/time paradoxes and simply enjoy the movie, which is certainly not hard to do at all.

And this is from a mans perspective I put my ego aside and saw the film because I do not discriminate film for being Chick flixs. I knew that this movie was very predictable but it was still entertaining to watch. I think as a critic you focus too much on cinemetography,locations,Is this the right actor. That in the end you never let your self get sucked in to the movie and realize that you are missing out on a good movie.

1013981,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B000HEWEE4,azindn,"[8, 13]","Alex (Keanu Reeves) and Kate (Sandra Bullock) both inhabit a modern glass house situated on a beautiful lake. Kate leaves it as Alex moves in. Alex receives a letter from the former tenant asking him to forward her mail to her new address in Chicago should the postal service fail, and she apologies for the dog's prints on the floor and box of stuff in the attic. Alex finds no dog prints or box in the attic but he does begin a correspondence with Kate which changes lives because Alex lives in 2004 and Kate in 2006. This subtle clue is followed by others including the situation that unlike modern professionals, Kate and Alex do not email nor seem to own a computer, a clue that this story is not the typical boy meets girl. And there is a traffic accident on the first day of Kate's new job and she aids a man who has been hit by a bus who later dies in her arms. It too is a clue that foreshadows what is to come in a convoluted story that transcends the ideas of time and space as scientific, empirical, and measurable.Thoroughly believable are the mature actors Reeves and Bullock, a couple with enormous screen charisma. Long ago women noticed the boyish Keanu's great leading man looks and waited for him to mature into a handsome, sensitive, and older man. This fact is never more enjoyable than this film which provides both actors with great solo moments of on screen time. Sandra Bullock has lost her girl next door cuteness replaced with a face that is mature and enormously attractive, not beautiful, but interesting to see as life unravels around her despite a successful medical career. Both personalities have tremendous believability and their give and take echos the brief snips of the ultimate screen lovers, Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman from Hitchcock's Suspicion, and in literature with Jane Austen's Persuasion. This is screen chemistry at its best. Th elegant Christopher Plummer is Keanu's cold, brilliant and distant architect father, who the son comes to grieve by elevating the design of his father's glass house into a home for Kate. How this comes to fruition is the gist of the film.If 4 U, 2+2=4, this film might not be enjoyable but if the possibility that 2+2=x, this could be your kind of off-center love story. Tears, sniffles, and an audible ""aw"" were discernible in the theater where I screened this film, and it was an enjoyable group catharsis when the lights came up to discover numerous individuals quickly wiping tears with sheepish smiles. So what if the dog plays chess, the book under the floorboard has no logical explanation, and the characters could not possibly be situated in time two years apart. I did not see the word ""documentary"" in the descriptions, nor that films in general were irrefutable and factual recordings of the laws of physics. This is a love story, a sweet one at that and as entertainment, I enjoyed the actors, characters, and the house. With a minor role, Dylan Walsh of TV fame makes a small role thoroughly forgivable as the stuffy, controlling attorney boyfriend, Morgan, but on screen, this is Keanu Reeves and Sandy Bullock's most excellent movie.",5,Kate and Alex: Romantic and Wonderful Screen Chemistry,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,3129,"['Alex', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Kate', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'inhabit', 'modern', 'glass', 'house', 'situated', 'beautiful', 'lake', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'Alex', 'letter', 'former', 'tenant', 'asking', 'forward', 'mail', 'new', 'address', 'Chicago', 'should', 'postal', 'service', 'fail', 'dog', 'prints', 'floor', 'box', 'stuff', 'attic', 'Alex', 'dog', 'prints', 'box', 'attic', 'begin', 'correspondence', 'Kate', 'lives', 'Alex', '2004', 'Kate', '2006', 'subtle', 'clue', 'followed', 'others', 'including', 'situation', 'modern', 'professionals', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'do', 'not', 'email', 'seem', 'own', 'computer', 'clue', 'story', 'not', 'typical', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'traffic', 'accident', 'first', 'day', 'Kate', 'new', 'job', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'hit', 'bus', 'who', 'later', 'arms', 'too', 'clue', 'what', 'come', 'convoluted', 'story', 'ideas', 'time', 'space', 'scientific', 'empirical', 'measurable.Thoroughly', 'believable', 'are', 'mature', 'actors', 'Reeves', 'Bullock', 'couple', 'enormous', 'screen', 'charisma', 'Long', 'ago', 'women', 'noticed', 'boyish', 'Keanu', 'great', 'leading', 'man', 'waited', 'mature', 'handsome', 'sensitive', 'older', 'man', 'fact', 'never', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'actors', 'great', 'solo', 'moments', 'screen', 'time', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'lost', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'cuteness', 'replaced', 'face', 'mature', 'enormously', 'attractive', 'not', 'beautiful', 'interesting', 'see', 'life', 'unravels', 'successful', 'medical', 'career', 'personalities', 'have', 'tremendous', 'believability', 'give', 'take', 'echos', 'brief', 'snips', 'ultimate', 'screen', 'lovers', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Hitchcock', 'Suspicion', 'literature', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Persuasion', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'best', 'Th', 'elegant', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Keanu', 'cold', 'brilliant', 'distant', 'architect', 'father', 'who', 'son', 'grieve', 'elevating', 'design', 'father', 'glass', 'house', 'home', 'Kate', 'How', 'fruition', 'gist', 'film.If', '4', 'U', '2+2=4', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'possibility', '2+2=x', 'could', 'be', 'kind', 'off-center', 'love', 'story', 'Tears', 'sniffles', 'audible', 'aw', 'were', 'discernible', 'theater', 'where', 'screened', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'group', 'catharsis', 'when', 'lights', 'came', 'up', 'discover', 'numerous', 'individuals', 'quickly', 'wiping', 'tears', 'sheepish', 'smiles', 'So', 'what', 'dog', 'chess', 'book', 'floorboard', 'logical', 'explanation', 'characters', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'situated', 'time', 'two', 'years', 'apart', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'word', 'documentary', 'descriptions', 'films', 'general', 'were', 'irrefutable', 'factual', 'recordings', 'laws', 'physics', 'love', 'story', 'sweet', 'one', 'entertainment', 'enjoyed', 'actors', 'characters', 'house', 'minor', 'role', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'TV', 'fame', 'small', 'role', 'thoroughly', 'forgivable', 'stuffy', 'controlling', 'attorney', 'boyfriend', 'Morgan', 'screen', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Sandy', 'Bullock', 'most', 'excellent', 'movie']",N/A

1013995,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000HEWEE4,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 2]","`the lake house', directed by Alejandro Agresti, reunites Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock in the lead roles, for the first time since they appeared in the action movie `Speed'. And, in a strange way, this movie is as unusual as a romantic comedy as `Speed' was as an action movie, since both movies are based on unusual premises.The assumption, no surprise to anyone who has seen the trailer, is that the Bullock (Kate Foster, a doctor fresh out of residency) and Reeves (Alex Wyler, a building contract supervisor) characters both occupy the same house set upon stilts just off the shore of a small lake somewhere within easy driving distance of Chicago, except that Wyler occupies it in 2004 and Forster occupies it in 2006. The two communicate across this span of two years by leaving letters in the lake house's mailbox. And, the characters realize this little temporal anomaly quickly, about 20 minutes into the movie. What the trailer doesn't reveal (but which does not do much to give things away) is the fact that this lake house was originally built by Wyler's father, a famous architect, played by Christopher Plummer.The story is so simple and the characters are so few, I am hard pressed to find interesting things about the film without giving away a major part of the plot. One thing I can say is that the time travel aspect of the time shift premise is so subdued, one gets absolutely no sense this is remotely like any `science fiction' or even `Twilight Zone' type of story. It is far more like some Cary Grant romantic story from the 1940s or 1930s, where two characters are supposed to meet at the top of the Empire State Building, but one of the two characters never shows up.One thing the time travel premise does do is eliminate any sense that this is a `romantic comedy'. There are some light-hearted moments, but it is not really much more amusing than `Love Story' or `The Paper Chase'. It is certainly not in the same comedy class as `The Wedding Crashers' or `The Breakup'. Another thing the time travel scenario does is make your head hurt when you try to work out the classic time travel paradoxes, when the two characters do meet in circumstances where the later character, Forster (Bullock) encounters the earlier character, Wyler (Reeves) and Forster is not aware of the cross-temporal communication, since it hasn't happened (for her) yet. Again, fortunately, the time travel hypothesis is well downplayed you hardly notice the anomalies.One thing for sure is that this movie `works' as a romantic story. By the time we are halfway through the flick, we really want them to get together and are frustrated when they can't seem to figure out the obvious solution to the problem and actually get together. When they do set a plan in motion, we are genuinely distressed when it doesn't work out. Even more distressing is the suspicion of why the meeting did not work out.The side stories involving Wyler's father and brother and Forster's job and boyfriend are lightly done, just enough to distract us for a bit from the main story line without taking on too much substance and stealing from the romance.One of the more interesting little conceits is the fact that the two main characters end up adopting the same stray dog, who then succeeds in occupying scenes in both 2004 and 2006. The curious thing is that said dog doesn't appear in the final scene... I guess that would have been stretching the old space-time continuum just a bit too far! I'm also just a tad disappointed that there is no hint of explanation for why these two people should find themselves in this situation at these particular times, but then we would start getting into `Twilight Zone' territory, and there is really no need to go there. It contributes nothing to the love story.So, it would have been nice to have a director's or writer's voice-over commentary to give us some of this stuff, but there is none, reducing somewhat the rewatchability of the flick. But, if you need a good date movie, this one is a winner.Note that I strongly suspect the widescreen version is highly recommended here.

1013996,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000HEWEE4,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[7, 22]","THE LAKE HOUSE fails on so many levels that it's tough to pin down one thing viewers will dislike the most. Be it the multiple unexplained fantasy elements, or the lame acting, or the dumb-downed plot, this film will most likely make you shoot popcorn out of your nose, not in laughter, but because of incredulity.A time-traveling mailbox (and, apparently, canine) bind two lonely souls together at a lake house. The place was built by Simon Wyler (Christopher Plummer, INSIDE MAN) for his now deceased wife. Being a successful architect, his sons fall into the family business too. One of these is Alex (Keanu Reeves, THE MATRIX), who purchases the house in 2004. Trouble is, though, the house is already owned ...in 2006. Not usually a problem, but apparently these two years in time are connected somehow. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock, CRASH) is the 2006 year owner and has just sold the place. She leaves a note for the new owner to send all mail to her forwarded address. But the mail gets picked up in 2004 by Alex, who's confused about the date she put on her message. When he sticks his reply in the mailbox, Kate picks it up ...in 2006, two years later. The two form an ""across-time"" romance, trying to meet up in Kate's year but failing. They do bump into one another in 2004 but neither realizes the importance of it.Okay, let's start with the basic problems: Why these two and why a mailbox? The two individuals chosen for this event may be overlooked as mere coincidence. But the mailbox? Please!Kate and Alex are separated by two years in time but brought together by the mailbox. The big issue here is that neither of them find this even remotely disturbing or incredible. They just accept it. The assumption must be that the script and director wanted to move on to the ""more interesting"" love story surrounding the two protagonists. The problem here, though, is that the romance is anything but interesting. It's distant (like the years that separate them), and rushed, and poorly acted. Bullock and Reeves had more chemistry in SPEED (that ought to tell you a lot!).Time travel movies are tough to pull off to begin with, and the challenge for most of them is avoiding the paradox they create. The Lake House doesn't even TRY to address this problem and simply plows ahead without considering the intelligence of its audience. For instance, at one point Kate (in 2006) goes to an architects office and discovers some disturbing news. She rushes out to try and prevent it from happening by sending Alex a letter. And they do avoid the disastrous event. The trouble is, though, is that if it's avoided, then there never was an event to begin with because Alex avoided it in 2004, thus, in 2006, there wouldn't have been this problem for Kate to worry about. Some may not be bothered by this, but many scientists must be pretty ticked-off that the film doesn't address this issue.And the final tragedy is the acting. Both Reeves and Bullock CAN act. We've seen them do it. But here they are bland, boring, and completely unsympathetic. Even Christopher Plummer's character seemed forced and poorly thought out.Need a sleep aid?

1014015,ASU5IH3CM6XXE,B000HEWEE4,ChrisTyrrell,"[5, 6]","OK, first of all, this is one of the top 5 movies of all time.  Before I even saw the movie, I was like ""Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are re-teaming for a movie about living in worlds 2 years apart, in the same house, but connected by a magical mailbox?!!!  This is going to be one of my all time top 10 favorite movies of all time!""  What I did not know at the time, however, was that it was going to be one of my top 5 movies of all time, easily beating 6-10.  I wish I could go back in time and tell myself--the self that hadn't yet seen the movie--that it would be this great.  Maybe I'll mail myself a letter.  No, I'm just kidding.  :)Anyway, why this movie is so great is that it harnesses all the charm of Keanu Reeves and the spitfireness of Sandra Bullock without all of that distracting plot that you might find in a movie like ""Speed.""  And by the way, how difficult is it to believe that a bus would blow up if it goes less than 55 MPH!  I didn't buy it.However, ""The Lake House"" is a movie grounded in reality and has a real heart at its center.  Every time I watch the movie, and at this point it's about bi-weekly, I notice more nuances to Keanu's acting, and I get choked up every time I realize that these two wonderful characters really may never meet because they live in two completely different time periods.  I worry that they're never going to meet (even though, yes, I've seen it so many times)--which is part of the magic of moviemaking I guess.  And I think even if they do meet, will they understand each other's worlds?  If the me of now were talking to the me of 2006, what would they possibly have in common?  The me of now would be all talking about iPhones and stuff, and the me of 2006 would be like, ""what the heck are iPhones?  Do you mean iPods?""  And the me of now would probably just get really, really frustrated.Essentially the movie is amazing and you should really see it on a big screen to get the full effects.

1014017,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B000HEWEE4,C. Middleton,"[2, 2]","The Lake House is a touching, moving and original story about `star-crossed-lovers', two strangers caught in an unexplained time rift, forced to communicate to each other only by written letters, whose relationship soon develops into true love, obsession and a battle against `fate'.The notion of changing historical events through time anomalies and accomplishing those changes has been explored in literature and film for many years.One of the most famous and currently almost forgotten tales of time-travel-love is H.G. Wells' The Time Machine. The entire purpose of the protagonist in the novel is to travel back in time to prevent the accidental death of his one and true love. Once creating his time machine, he travels back to the moment of his beloved's death only to come against `fate'; she was meant to die, and no matter what he does, the girl comes to her death despite the inventor's best efforts...fighting fate will always be a losing battle.In The lake House, this particular theme is a little less dramatic, however, is a modern love story about loneliness, falling in love with someone you have never actually met, the utter persistence of those in love to meet and finally be with them and the view that love, in its purest form, will overcome anything, including opposition, distance, and the passage of time.Reeves and Bullock, though not sharing many scenes together, (mostly the dialogue between them in the form of their letters) managed to convey a certain emotional realism.In this film at least, Reeves appears to have matured as an actor: there is nothing forced or uncomfortable about this performance, he has grown in the craft and truly carried the character with believability and apparent ease.Sandra Bullock has shown time and time again that she is an ""all rounder"" in the profession. Her comedic roles are funny, sometimes hilarious, and her `serious' roles can and do stand up against the best actresses currently in vogue in Hollywood. There is an undefinable charm about Sandra Bullock, which, really, came through loud and clear in this film.The Lake House is entertaining for a `romance', as it places love against unusual circumstances, written, directed and edited with a simple idea in mind, and executed with skill and vision.4.5 stars.",4,A Surprisingly Moving Love Story,1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,2282,"['Lake', 'House', 'touching', 'moving', 'original', 'story', 'star-crossed-lovers', 'two', 'strangers', 'caught', 'unexplained', 'time', 'rift', 'forced', 'communicate', 'other', 'only', 'written', 'letters', 'relationship', 'soon', 'true', 'love', 'obsession', 'battle', ""fate'.The"", 'notion', 'changing', 'historical', 'events', 'time', 'anomalies', 'accomplishing', 'changes', 'been', 'explored', 'literature', 'film', 'many', 'years.One', 'most', 'famous', 'currently', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'tales', 'time-travel-love', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'Time', 'Machine', 'entire', 'purpose', 'protagonist', 'novel', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'prevent', 'accidental', 'death', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'Once', 'creating', 'time', 'machine', 'back', 'moment', 'beloved', 'death', 'only', 'come', 'fate', 'was', 'meant', 'die', 'matter', 'what', 'girl', 'death', 'inventor', 'best', 'efforts', 'fighting', 'fate', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'losing', 'battle.In', 'lake', 'House', 'particular', 'theme', 'little', 'less', 'dramatic', 'however', 'modern', 'love', 'story', 'loneliness', 'falling', 'love', 'someone', 'have', 'never', 'actually', 'met', 'utter', 'persistence', 'love', 'meet', 'finally', 'be', 'view', 'love', 'purest', 'form', 'will', 'overcome', 'anything', 'including', 'opposition', 'distance', 'passage', 'time.Reeves', 'Bullock', 'not', 'sharing', 'many', 'scenes', 'together', 'mostly', 'dialogue', 'form', 'letters', 'managed', 'convey', 'certain', 'emotional', 'realism.In', 'film', 'least', 'have', 'matured', 'actor', 'nothing', 'forced', 'uncomfortable', 'performance', 'grown', 'craft', 'truly', 'carried', 'character', 'believability', 'apparent', 'ease.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'shown', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'rounder', 'profession', 'comedic', 'roles', 'are', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'hilarious', 'serious', 'roles', 'can', 'do', 'stand', 'up', 'best', 'actresses', 'currently', 'vogue', 'Hollywood', 'undefinable', 'charm', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'really', 'came', 'loud', 'clear', 'film.The', 'Lake', 'House', 'entertaining', 'romance', 'love', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'written', 'directed', 'edited', 'simple', 'idea', 'mind', 'executed', 'skill', 'vision.4.5', 'stars']",N/A

These two actors have great chemistry, which was shown in the movie Speed, and it was nice seeing them in a romantic film.  This is the story of Kate and Alex, two people who are perfect for each other.  There's one significant problem though -- they're in a long distance relationship.  Alex is in the year 2004 and Kate is in the year 2006.  They meet by way of the lake house, where Kate moves out of to work as a doctor in Chicago.  Alex owns the lake house, and his letter exchange with Kate begins after the former tenant (Kate) leaves a welcome letter to the new tenant (Alex)... except that Alex lives two years behind Kate.  Will they ever get to meet?The time anomalies make the film confusing at times, but the story of two star-crossed lovers who transcend time is wonderful.  Bullock and Reeves make film magic in their scenes together and when they write each other letters.  My favorite scene is the one where they slow dance during Kate's birthday party.  The song they play during that scene is great.  It's difficult to write a review without giving details away (though I'm sure some people have done that already), but all I can say is that this is a great romantic film, one of the best I've seen this year along with The Notebook and The Phantom of the Opera.

1014023,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000HEWEE4,Cubist,"[3, 4]","In an interesting bit of counter-programming and offering some relief from the glut of big, dumb summer action movies, The Lake House is a romantic movie for adults and is a reunion for Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock who, ironically, starred in the blockbuster action film, Speed. Obviously, the powers that be hoped that lightning would strike twice as they had such genuine chemistry in that movie.Logically, this movie is a mess but it is a testimony to the chemistry of Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves that this matters little towards the overall enjoyment of watching their romance play out.Bullock has been spinning her wheels, career-wise, in the past few years with flawed dramas (Murder By Numbers) and forgettable comedies (did we really need a Miss Congeniality 2?) but has finally found the right material and the ideal role that showcases the same kind of attractive vulnerability that made the world fall in love with her in the first place. She has an enchanting smile that is beautiful to see. This enhances her character's appealing personality and makes you care about her.Reeves has definitely improved as an actor with age, delivering his most relaxed performance to date. He's always come across as stiff in many of his roles with his best efforts when he plays a more reactive character (i.e. My Own Private Idaho). However, with Something's Gotta Give he showed a capacity for light comedy in a much-needed break from the action and science fiction genres. The Lake House suits him well as he slips comfortably into his character.Credit must also go to director Alejandro Agresti who utilizes a warm and inviting colour scheme of earth tones that is perfect for this movie as it envelopes you and draws you in. He also adopts a leisurely pace, gradually immersing us in this engaging world and taking its time in getting to know these characters.In this day and age with email and instant messaging, it is refreshing to see a film that champions correspondence the old fashioned way - through handwritten letters. There is something more personal, more tangible than impersonal emails. Alex and Kate are lonely souls and in no time flat you want to see them together. This is a large part of the appeal of The Lake House. This is a romantic movie for our times with two busy professionals who are isolated in modern society and find each other through a bit of magic realism.The key to any romantic movie is the chemistry between the two leads and Bullock and Reeves have it, recreating the same spark that they had together in Speed only now they are a little older and wiser. Both have matured as actors and are a perfect for this movie. So, ignore the daft logic that The Lake House struggles to maintain - it is merely a device for which to establish a connection between the two lead actors. Once this happens nothing else matters but the relationship that develops between these two intriguing characters.""Additional Scenes and Outtakes"" features more footage of Alex and Mona's disintegrating relationship, including its inevitable demise. There are a few other bits that were rightly cut as they would have distracted from the main story.Also included is a theatrical trailer.",5,Engaging Leads Triumph Over Daft Logic,1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,3208,"['interesting', 'bit', 'counter-programming', 'offering', 'relief', 'glut', 'big', 'dumb', 'summer', 'action', 'movies', 'Lake', 'House', 'romantic', 'movie', 'adults', 'reunion', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'ironically', 'starred', 'blockbuster', 'action', 'film', 'Speed', 'Obviously', 'powers', 'be', 'hoped', 'lightning', 'would', 'strike', 'twice', 'had', 'such', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'movie.Logically', 'movie', 'mess', 'testimony', 'chemistry', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Keanu', 'matters', 'little', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'romance', 'play', 'out.Bullock', 'been', 'spinning', 'wheels', 'career-wise', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'flawed', 'dramas', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'forgettable', 'comedies', 'did', 'really', 'need', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', '2', 'finally', 'found', 'right', 'material', 'ideal', 'role', 'same', 'kind', 'attractive', 'vulnerability', 'made', 'world', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'place', 'enchanting', 'smile', 'beautiful', 'see', 'character', 'appealing', 'personality', 'care', 'her.Reeves', 'definitely', 'improved', 'actor', 'age', 'delivering', 'most', 'relaxed', 'performance', 'date', 'always', 'come', 'stiff', 'many', 'roles', 'best', 'efforts', 'when', 'more', 'reactive', 'character', 'i.e', 'Own', 'Private', 'Idaho', 'However', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'showed', 'capacity', 'light', 'comedy', 'much-needed', 'break', 'action', 'science', 'fiction', 'genres', 'Lake', 'House', 'suits', 'well', 'comfortably', 'character.Credit', 'must', 'also', 'go', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Agresti', 'who', 'warm', 'inviting', 'colour', 'scheme', 'earth', 'tones', 'perfect', 'movie', 'draws', 'also', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'gradually', 'immersing', 'engaging', 'world', 'taking', 'time', 'getting', 'know', 'characters.In', 'day', 'age', 'email', 'instant', 'messaging', 'refreshing', 'see', 'film', 'champions', 'correspondence', 'old', 'fashioned', 'way', 'handwritten', 'letters', 'something', 'more', 'personal', 'more', 'tangible', 'impersonal', 'emails', 'Alex', 'Kate', 'are', 'lonely', 'souls', 'time', 'flat', 'want', 'see', 'together', 'large', 'part', 'appeal', 'Lake', 'House', 'romantic', 'movie', 'times', 'two', 'busy', 'professionals', 'who', 'are', 'isolated', 'modern', 'society', 'find', 'other', 'bit', 'magic', 'realism.The', 'key', 'romantic', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'Bullock', 'Reeves', 'have', 'recreating', 'same', 'spark', 'had', 'together', 'Speed', 'only', 'now', 'are', 'little', 'older', 'wiser', 'have', 'matured', 'actors', 'are', 'perfect', 'movie', 'So', 'ignore', 'daft', 'logic', 'Lake', 'House', 'maintain', 'merely', 'device', 'establish', 'connection', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'Once', 'nothing', 'else', 'matters', 'relationship', 'two', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'Additional', 'Scenes', 'Outtakes', 'more', 'footage', 'Alex', 'Mona', 'disintegrating', 'relationship', 'including', 'inevitable', 'demise', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'bits', 'were', 'rightly', 'cut', 'would', 'have', 'distracted', 'main', 'story.Also', 'included', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

I don't sit there and try and figure out how or why the mailbox works the way it does just like I don't sit there and wonder how the Enterprise reaches warp speed (Star Trek) or the man outraces the Sun (Mummy Returns).The plot is basically a love story and rather than two people falling in love over the internet and e-mail they instead do it the old fashioned way and fall in love through snail mail. However the device of the time difference means that the two cannot simply meet face-to-face in a traditional date. The plot reminded me of a similar plot device in a TV movie I saw where two lovers corresponded the same way across centuries with the letters magically appearing in an old cabinet.Take the movie for what it is and pick up this enjoyable, charming romantic movie on Blu-ray for under $10 (as of Nov. 13, 2009).

But you throw in a space/time continuum component in a chick flick and I'm scratching my head and getting lost faster than a fourth grader in a quantum physics course.  Alas, such is the case with Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, and THE LAKE HOUSE.  I watched this flick twice, and my head still hurts.  For instance:1.  If we accept the premise there are parallel universes (allowing Keanu and Sandra to correspond simultaneously, even though they are two years apart), how can the two actually interact in Keanu's universe?  If I remember my ""Star Trek"" factoids, don't people like implode when they occupy two universes at once?2.  (Spoiler Alert!)  And if Keanu dies on Valentine's Day 2006 (but then later on gets a heads up from Sandra not to cross that busy street) and then asks his brother what day it is (and his brother says, ""It's Valentine's Day 2006"") and thereby avoids his date with destiny, then at the end of the movie the two lovers finally meet and Sandra says, ""You waited two years,"" doesn't that mean it is now Valentine's Day 2008?  So this movie takes place in the future?3.  What's with the mailbox?  Keanu and Sandra both wait patiently at the Lake House, watching the mailbox. . .and then the flag mysteriously rises, indicating a letter will appear inside.  If the flag rises wouldn't that mean the parallel universes have again intertwined, whereby the two could interact (see Point 1 above)?4.  Poor Morgan (Dylan Walsh).  He really has the hots for Sandra, but she never gets more than lukewarm for him.  Yet he hangs on in the relationship.  Dumb Morgan.I could go on and on (and on).  Oh, and Keanu is as wooden as the desk I'm typing on, and Sandra is one ultra-depressed chick.  And Christopher Plummer is ageless.

She has been living for the past two years in a beautiful lake house outside of the city.  Alex Wyler has just moved to this lake house; he is an architect and is passionate about his work, but is not entirely fulfilled by the box-like condoes he is currently contracted to build.The two of them meet via the lake house mail box when Kate leaves a letter to the subsequent tenant requesting that he forward her mail.  After a few exchanges, always via the magical lake house mail box, they come to accept the fact that they are separated by exactly two years.  Kate is living in 2006 and Alex is back in 2004.  Immediately, they strike up an excited correspondance, sharing their pasts, likes, dislikes and hobbies.  In a wonderful scene, Alex takes Kate on a tour of Chicago's most beautiful architectural works by sending her a guided map and visiting the sites himself that same afternoon, two years before.  As their feelings for one develop however, Kate becomes more and more troubled by the two year barrier between them.The two year barrier that separates them is handled extremely nicely.  There aren't any complicated, mind-boggling overlaps/complications, as in The Butterfly Effect or Back To The Future.  Alex in fact does see Kate a few times, and even talks with her in one scene, back in his time, although of course she doesn't know him yet.  Naturally, this movie's main theme is that of waiting, and of picking the ""right time"" to meet.  I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that the end is just spectacular.This is a great movie for just about everyone, except maybe those people who can't stand love stories as a rule.  There aren't any stupid, incredibly sappy moments.  It's funny, touching and suspenseful, and the charactes are extremely likable and well-developed.  Alex's relationship with his father, a world famous architect who has always been emotionally distant, was a very poignant side plot.  Similarly, Alex's relationship with his younger brother, also an aspiring architect, is warm and very real.  Kate is similarly compelling; having just recently lost her father, her loneliness and sense of isolation are almost immediately apparent.  Even so, she's often funny and quirky; in one scene, she confesses to Alex how desperate she sometimes feels because she's so isolated from everyone else, and we're shown her in her apartment, trying to play chess with her dog.Again--a really lovely, magical movie.

(Yes, ""Somewhere in Time,"" starring Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour, also toyed with this idea in 1980 . . . but few have done so since). Now, there are some very familiar strains heard in this film (both American and Korean). NONETHELESS, the ""heart"" of this movie triumphs over whatever cliches you might find.Moreover, I have read some complaints that the film is either A.) difficult to follow OR B.) inaccurate. Neither are true. Initially, you have to puzzle through ""who is where"" . . . but we are SHARING the characters' own confusion (it is meant to bond us to the film). Soon, the film clarifies (as the characters situations become clear to THEM) and we can enjoy the love-story:) And, yes, the writing makes perfect sense. If you have ever unraveled the physics of Kelly's ""Donnie Darko"" . . . or simply delighted in a time-travel film . . . you will understand HOW this all works out:) And, even if you have not done either of these things, I'm willing to bet that you will not get lost or frustrated with this film.Reeves and Bullock portray their characters tenderly and convincingly. (They both just keep getting better-looking . . . which gives us thirty-somethingers hope for the future!!) Moreover, there is just enough tension in the film to keep the audience ""guessing"" . . . trust me. Ohhh, and did I mention the adorable canine who obviously has some pact with cupid?!!No, this film isn't perfect, but that hardly matters. Put your ""intellect"" on hold for an hour and a half, and just enjoy this film for what it is.  (Hide it from your girlfriend if you are too embarrassed to watch with her the first time through . . . and then share it with her later . . . don't forget the tissues!!)Frequently, I advise to see the original (especially after a cavalcade of bad Asian adaptations) but this one succeeds in its intended goal!!

1014050,A30J7WQV0ZNRXG,B000HEWEE4,"D. Reinstein ""marindavid""","[4, 15]","have always been a fan of both Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. So much so, in fact, that I have come to tolerate silly, waste-of-film-money-and-time efforts from both of them, trusting that their next effort will probably be better and that even great actors (which neither of them is) have participated in 'dogs.' In this particular film, which I found to be slow to the point of truly boring and resolved in a way not used by convention since ancient Greece, I find myself feeling less hopeful about either of their futures as serious actors - at least about their judgement in choosing material!The Lake House has been much written about, so there is probably no need to detail the plot here. Suffice it to say that there is one house (on a lake) occupied by two people at two different times (one in 2004 and the other in 2006) who manage to correspond through a mysterious, unexplained time portal (the mailbox in front of the house.)Kind of a silly premise - but, in and of itself, not sillier or with less merit than many other movies made and seen by tens of millions of people around the world today.The pace is painfully slow as the sketchy plot - relying largely on the mailbox gimic- unfolds. I actually fell asleep twice before the final fifteen minutes which were, in my opinion, simply unforgivable.WARNING:DO NOT READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH UNLESS YOU WANT THE ENDING 'SPOILED'... A BIT OF AN OXYMORON ACTUALLY. BUT THERE IT IS!Had the film ended with the Bullock character finding out that the Reeves character was dead - I might have come away feeling differently. However, it doesn't. The director and writer choose, instead, to add on ten - fifteen minutes of gratuitous footage which I can only characterize as a Deus-Ex-Machina attempt to tie together, explain and resolve senseless premises and actions.OK TO RESUME WITH THE ENDING ESSENTIALLY UNREVEALED.For those of you unfamiliar with the convention: In ancient Greek theatre, the writers would often write themselves and the actors into a corner of complexity so severe and twisted by the end of the play that logical solution was not possible. So, a convention was developed called ""Deus Ex Machina"" - literally, ""God in a machine."" At the moment of unsolvable complexity coinciding with the end of the audience's patience, an actor wearing the mask of a god would be lowered from the 'rafters' by winch (the 'machine'), stand center stage and simply explain away all the unresolved elements of the show.

He's living in a NE Illinois lake house, and she's a doctor living in Chicago.There's more. He's in 2004. She's in 2006. This truly is a love story that transcends time. The screenwriters never get around to explaining how this can be possible, so it's a bit confusing. It will remind you a little of the 1980 Christopher Reeve/Jane Seymour flick ""Somewhere in Time"" (though the Reeve/Seymour movie was much better IMHO, maybe because I love Mackinac Island).The film begins when Wyler moves into the lake house and discovers a note from the previous tenant, Dr. Kate Forster. They begin a correspondence and realize over the course of time that they are living two years apart. Can they ever meet? Will they ever meet? Can something like this ever work?The concept is fascinating enough to keep you hooked to the end, but the second half of the movie drifts into predictable, mushy, love story chick flick territory. (How can the two timebound lovebirds know that they are in love so early in the correspondence? How can macho guy Keanu Reeves be saddled with such gooey lines?Furthermore, I started to figure things out too soon for my own enjoyment, and I'm not normally known for being able to do that.Having voiced my criticisms, I still recommend the movie because it is creative and you get to see Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves together again for the first time since Speed.Rev.

Thurlow,"[4, 5]","""The Lake House"" pairs up Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves for the first time since ""Speed"" in what turns out to be a very watchable but unconventional romance.Bullock plays Doctor Kay Forster, who is departing a unique glass cottage on a lake to return to Chicago.  She leaves a note for the next tenant, architect and builder Alex Wyler, played by Reeves.  The two fall into an exchange of letters and it soon becomes apparent, with several humorous touches, that Alex is in the cottage in 2004, while somehow Kay is living in 2006.  The singularity of a time-traveling mailbox outside the cottage is never explained; viewers are advised to accept it as a necessary plot contrivance.  Alex and Kay discover the time difference in an hilarious scene in which the two stand in the same place two years apart, reading and writing a series of notes that are essentially being passed back and forth through the mailbox.The correspondence across time brings two lonely but compatible people together.  Their slowly blossoming romance is complicated in a interesting way by the time difference.  Alex actually has a couple of contacts with the 2004 Kay, who knows nothing yet of Alex or the Lake House and is involved with an obnoxious and disposable boyfriend.  A scene in which the 2006 Kay asks Alex to retrieve a book she lost in 2004 is nicely done; Alex's ultimately successful effort to return the book helps cement their relationship.The desire of the 2004 Alex and the 2006 Kay to meet face to face begins to drive the story.  A date with Kay arranged two years in advance by Alex fails, heartbreakingly, when Alex fails to appear.  At this point, a fatal accident that Kay witnessed at the start of her medical residency in 2004 begins to overshadow the story.  Kay must use her knowledge of the future to somehow change the past.  The dramatic ending of the movie makes it all worthwhile.The Glass House on the lake is a fascinating structure in and of itself; unfortunately, we never get a really good look at it.  Christopher Plummer has an outstanding cameo as Alex's father, a famous architect who built the Glass House before essentially abandoning his family.  Shohreh Aghdashloo is outstanding as Kay's medical mentor, who in one of several loop-backs in the movie also treats Alex's dying father.This movie is highly recommended to viewers looking for a romantic movie featuring two leads with real onscreen chemistry; those who obsess over the time-traveling wrinkles of the plot are likely to miss the best of the story.",4,Romance is Timeless...,1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,2535,"['Lake', 'House', 'up', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'first', 'time', 'Speed', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'watchable', 'unconventional', 'romance.Bullock', 'plays', 'Doctor', 'Kay', 'Forster', 'who', 'departing', 'unique', 'glass', 'cottage', 'lake', 'return', 'Chicago', 'note', 'next', 'tenant', 'architect', 'builder', 'Alex', 'Wyler', 'played', 'Reeves', 'two', 'fall', 'exchange', 'letters', 'soon', 'apparent', 'several', 'humorous', 'touches', 'Alex', 'cottage', '2004', 'somehow', 'Kay', 'living', '2006', 'singularity', 'time-traveling', 'mailbox', 'cottage', 'never', 'explained', 'viewers', 'are', 'advised', 'accept', 'necessary', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'Alex', 'Kay', 'discover', 'time', 'difference', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'two', 'stand', 'same', 'place', 'two', 'years', 'apart', 'reading', 'writing', 'series', 'notes', 'are', 'essentially', 'being', 'passed', 'back', 'forth', 'mailbox.The', 'correspondence', 'time', 'two', 'lonely', 'compatible', 'people', 'together', 'slowly', 'blossoming', 'romance', 'complicated', 'interesting', 'way', 'time', 'difference', 'Alex', 'actually', 'couple', 'contacts', '2004', 'Kay', 'who', 'nothing', 'yet', 'Alex', 'Lake', 'House', 'involved', 'obnoxious', 'disposable', 'boyfriend', 'scene', '2006', 'Kay', 'Alex', 'retrieve', 'book', 'lost', '2004', 'nicely', 'done', 'Alex', 'ultimately', 'successful', 'effort', 'return', 'book', 'cement', 'relationship.The', 'desire', '2004', 'Alex', '2006', 'Kay', 'meet', 'face', 'face', 'begins', 'drive', 'story', 'date', 'Kay', 'arranged', 'two', 'years', 'advance', 'Alex', 'fails', 'heartbreakingly', 'when', 'Alex', 'appear', 'point', 'fatal', 'accident', 'Kay', 'witnessed', 'start', 'medical', 'residency', '2004', 'begins', 'overshadow', 'story', 'Kay', 'must', 'use', 'knowledge', 'future', 'somehow', 'change', 'past', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'movie', 'worthwhile.The', 'Glass', 'House', 'lake', 'fascinating', 'structure', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'get', 'really', 'good', 'look', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'outstanding', 'cameo', 'Alex', 'father', 'famous', 'architect', 'who', 'built', 'Glass', 'House', 'essentially', 'abandoning', 'family', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'outstanding', 'Kay', 'medical', 'mentor', 'who', 'one', 'several', 'loop-backs', 'movie', 'also', 'Alex', 'dying', 'father.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'viewers', 'looking', 'romantic', 'movie', 'featuring', 'two', 'leads', 'real', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'who', 'obsess', 'time-traveling', 'wrinkles', 'plot', 'are', 'likely', 'miss', 'best', 'story']",N/A

1014057,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000HEWEE4,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 5]","Not since Jeannot Szwarc's gooey ""Somewhere in Time"" (1980) have I seen a movie so willing to suspend credibility and logic for the sake of conveying an idealistic romance, but Argentinean director Alejandro Agresti (in his American film bow) and screenwriter David Auburn somehow manage to keep their convoluted fable afloat despite the layers of fantasy-driven contrivance. Underneath it all, the 2006 movie is really an old-fashioned 1950's-style woman's picture, and one wonders what Douglas Sirk could have done with the material in a lavish Ross Hunter production. Instead, we are given a precocious, time-jumping tale detailing the improbable romance between Alex Wyler, an angst-driven architect who has become a condo developer, and Kate Forster, a lonely doctor. Their common thread is the unique glass house designed by Alex's father that sits literally on a lake near Chicago, where both have lived at different times. They correspond through handwritten letters, but the twist is that they are existing two years apart and have only a magical mailbox to transcend the time difference.The fantastical premise sounds silly, and to some degree it is, but in a surprisingly effective manner, the filmmakers and cast take it all quite seriously. It's all about execution and the emotional subtleties in the script. Luckily, Auburn dances around the credibility issues with a swooning sense of romance. The externals capture the feeling as well - Alar Kivilo's crisp, autumnal-to-wintry cinematography and Meg Everist's set decorations both capture Chicago at its most cinematic; and Rachel Portman's evocative score filled with music from baby boomer icons like Carole King and Paul McCartney. There is a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in Sandra Bullock's Kate since the actress has played variations of the same lonely girl over the years, though she has gratefully dropped her perky demeanor for a more resonant performance. Keanu Reeves is sincere as Alex, though a bit too overtly new-age-male to compensate for his innate inscrutability. Still, aside from Bullock's sharply vituperative turn in Paul Haggis' ""Crash"", this is probably the best work either has done in a while.Individually, Reeves and Bullock convey the solitude of their characters with a minimum of fuss, and when they do connect, they generate real chemistry in rather creative ways. That's what really matters with a movie like this. The supporting cast consists mostly of unsurprising stock characters, in particular, Dylan Walsh as Kate's insecure intended, Morgan, and Lynn Collins as Alex's anxious co-worker, Mona.

Most people would skip movies like that because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". The Lake House was really quite clean.The only sexual scenes in the movie are when a man and a woman kiss passionately and hug; a man and a woman dance closely together and kiss (the woman's boyfriend interrupts them); and there are several other scenes where a man and a woman kiss.  There are also a few low-cut tops and dresses that reveal cleavage and once a woman's nightgown is sheer and the outline of her legs is visible when she stands in front of a window.The only violence is when a man is struck by a bus and a car is struck by the same bus (you only see the man lying still on the ground and hear later that he died); a man is in a hospital after having had a heart attack (you don't witness it); a man cries after learning of the death of his father; a woman describes the plot of a book that includes a short description of a husband breaking his wife's neck with an ax (she says it with an accent, and so it is kind of hard to understand).  There are a few utterances of mild obscenity and a few scenes where people drink alcohol in a bar.The movie is about Kate Forster, a lonely doctor living in the year 2006, who moves from an unusual lakeside home to Chicago. After witnessing a man being hit by a bus, and upset that she can't save him and that his life ended so suddently, she takes the advice of a co-worker and goes back to the lake house, where she felt most like herself.  Through the mail box, she begins exchanging love letters with the lake house's former resident, Alex Wyler, a frustrated architect living two years in the past.  In 2004 (his time) his path crosses hers unexpectedly, but he is afraid to say anything to her, for fear that she would think him crazy. In 2006 (her time) they decide to meet, but he never shows up.  Thinking that she let get lost in this dream, and that they were too late to make it work, she tells him to let her let him go. Apparently fate has a different idea, and once again, with the help of the magic mailbox to the past, she has a chance to change the future and bring them both together at last.Overall, I really loved the movie. Actually, it is one of my favorite movies.  In know the whole idea of a mail box that connects the past and the future together is a little unbelievable, but since when are movies supposed to be completely believable.

It worked in ""Speed"" and it works here in ""The Lake House."" Very different genres of movies but chemistry is chemistry. You either have it or you don't. And what's more, Reeves and Bullock pull it off even while spending the majority of the movie apart and only talking (well, writing) to each other.I found ""The Lake House"" to be a refreshing, unconventional (in a good way) and enjoyable film despite its implausible premise. But the focused script and good directing carry it through. Sandra Bullock is great as usual, enough said. Keanu Reeves (ghasp!) actually manages a good performance too, yes, showing *emotion*. Who would have thought he had it in him after all. I've always been a fan of his anyway, but I can say objectively this is by far his best performance (with ""My Own Private Idaho"" coming in second-another film to watch if you want to see Keanu Reeves demonstrate what he's capable of).I do have a couple of issues with ""The Lake House,"" as much as I liked it. One, the premise is just too far-fetched, no matter how much I wanted to just ""go along with it."" The holes in the plot are simply too obvious to be overlooked, and this isn't necessarily the fault of anyone; it's only inevitable with this type of story. And two, I found the ending way too feel-good ""Hollywood"" for my taste. So for these reasons I must lower my review to 4 stars.Still, I would highly recommend this film. It's certainly loads better than the usual for-the-masses-factory-assembly-line crap out there. Despite its flaws, ""The Lake House"" has a charm that works.

Sandra Bullock on one hand was considered at one point of time as Americas Sweetheart, which charmingly played to tune on this mature yet approaching flick.Alex moves into a house on the lake only to find a letter in the postbox, a letter filled with words that only he can begin to understand, words that would begin to make sense with every sentence as time moved on. Kate would move in a couple of years later and discover a distance so close to love that is almost inexistence.The Lake House was executed so well that I loved every minute of the movie, the art direction is space filling, and the shots are full of depth and strangely encapsulates the existence of the two main characters.

Two begin to communicate via letters left in the mailbox and suddenly realize that they are as far away from each other as 2004 and 2006 are.

You will see the gentle and intimate site of Chicago that you did not know even existed. You will be moved and entertained...If you are not in the right mood, you'd begin looking for the logical faults and plentiful holes in the plot and you would say scornfully, ""another chick flick with Keanu as a romantic hero"" - so, it is up to you.6.5/10",3,"""Can this be happening?

What if these two were separated by time with only a magical mailbox at a lake house their sole means of communicating?This time paradox is a clever way to create a romantic story.  For Dr. Kate Forster who lives in the present, her life has been one long search for love.  Alex Wyler is attempting to recapture his past happiness by buying the lake house on Maple Lake where he grew up.  The lake house was designed and built by his famous father, Simon Wyler, who is very distant and unhappy with Alex's choice of pursuing construction over architecture.The catch here is that Alex is in 2004 and Kate is in 2006.  The lake house is their connection because Kate rented the lake house after Alex moved out, even though to Alex in 2004 the lake house had not been lived in for years when he reads Kate's first message welcoming the new tenant.When you toss in a dog named Jack which serves as a bridge between Kate and Jack, you have a bit of a mystery.  The dog seems more than just a simple canine who brings events about in 2004 and 2006.Sometimes it is a bit confusing knowing for sure what year it is, especially when 2008 is tossed in the paradox near the end of the film.  The 2008 for Kate is to seize her moment of destiny and attempt to alter fate.There two elements or gems which play in the background of this film.  One is the 1946 film Notorious staring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, and the second is Jane Austen's Persuasion.Overall this is a unusual film with time and fate paradoxes with romance, soul mates, and destiny rolled into this delightful fairytale. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are excellent as Alex and Kate.Christopher Plummer as Simon Wyler and Dylan Walsh as Morgan, Alex's foil in winning the hand and heart of Kate, are well cast.  You can tell from the beginning that Morgan is definitely the wrong guy for Kate.The only issue that I had with this DVD was the sound quality.  I had to amplify the sound through my receiver to hear the dialogue.

1014082,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000HEWEE4,Grady Harp,"[5, 7]","Anytime a story is about time travel the audience must accept the fact that suspension of belief is mandatory.  Based on a Korean film 'Siworae' by Eun-Jeong Kim and Ji-na Yeo and adapted for the latest version by David Auburn, Alejandro Agresti has his work cut out for him.  The story is Swiss cheese full of holes as anyone would expect from a tale about two people who fall in love from the disparate vantages of 2004 and 2006 and as long as the viewer accepts the inherent incongruities of such a story the overall effect is really quite lovely, if a bit too uninvolving.Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) has a history of living in a glass lake house outside Chicago but when we meet her she lives in a luxury apartment while she is on staff at a small hospital.  Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) currently lives in the lake house (we discover that his father played by Christopher Plummer is an architect who built the house years ago) and begins to find mail in his mailbox from the previous tenant Kate.  The story weaves back and forth between 2004 and 2006 and keeping score is rather tricky at times, but eventually of course the two time-lapsed people meet, the riddles are unexplained, they fall in love over the distance of time, etc.  There is not a lot of message here except that real love can occur despite almost any obstacle.Reeves and Bullock are fine, but the rest of the characters are sketchy and only tangentially relevant to the story.  A family discourse among Reeves, Plummer, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Henry, the other brother) never gels.  The supporting cast includes interesting actors such as Shohreh Aghdashloo but they have little to do.  In fact the scenery and the house seem to be the main characters and that really is OK because both are beautiful, thanks to Alar Kivilo's cinematography, and Rachel Portman's musical score is very fine.  It is not a deep film and it could benefit from a really good re-write of the script, but for an evening's diversion it is pretty to look at and tender in content.  Just forget about the holes and you'll be fine.

Get all those pesky left-brained thoughts out of your head such as:* If Kate is a busy doctor and the Lake House mailbox is the only portal to the future, how does she keep getting over there to stick letters in the mailbox?* Why do Kate and Alex see the flag go up and down, but never the mailbox door open?* Why does one of them always seem to be right at the mailbox to retrieve a letter immediately after one is placed in the box?* How do they end up having these seemingly real time conversations on park benches and in the hospital lounge area, given that the mailbox seems to be the only time portal?* If Alex planted a tree in 2004, how the heck could a tree suddenly appear in Kate's 2006 time line out of nothing? Wouldn't it have been there the whole time? And isn't it amazing that Kate would happen to be there to witness it as opposed to not being there or worse, standing on the exact same spot of ground only to be catapulted up in the air on the tree branches?* Granted these guys are star-crossed lovers with a temporal problem, but don't either of them take any interest in the 2004 lotto numbers and best stock picks?* And how the heck did both of them end up with the same dog? When the dog wanders over to Morgan, Morgan doesn't try to return her and Alex doesn't try to get her back? Don't even wonder about this one, because you'll never get your answer.Forget about the temporal anomalies (even for this story) and plot holes the size of a Buick. Concentrate on the acting which is quite good, particularly by the dog (seriously, the best canine actor I've seen since Lassie and the dog in Frazier) and Keanu Reeves, who provides a very convincing portrayal of a man in love with a woman he can't meet because she's in the future. I was *far* more convinced he was in love with the Sandra Bullock character than Diane Keaton's character in ""Something's Gotta Give."" There will be slow parts in the movie, but if you're a heterosexual woman or ... man, feasting your eyes on the better-than-average looking Keanu Reeves will help the time pass.

When Kate leaves a note for the future resident of the lake house, Alex wonders who she is and how she is able to ""predict"" events that happen during the house's history. He begins to correspond with her through a magical mailbox on the house's property and they realize that they are living in two different time periods, with Kate writing him from two years in the future.The movie spans two years of Kate's life (four for Alex) while the two characters try to arrange meetings and somehow connect in Kate's past.  As events unfold, the two realize they are in love with each other but every time they try to meet, something goes wrong.If you can get over the crazy correspondence through a magical mailbox, this is a very dreamy, romantic movie.  I was thinking that since the mailbox was the only thing that worked for both of them in their respective times, maybe one of them should try climbing into it or something.The movie falls apart if you think about it too hard.  Why doesn't Alex try to pursue Kate a little harder during the 2004-2006 span?  There are several instances where the two characters are in the same place at the same time.  How hard would it have been to ask for her phone number?  On the same token, Kate could have easily given Alex more ways to find her in the past.  ""Hey, I was single in 2005, here's where I lived and worked, come find me.""  At the very least, Alex could have gone back to the lake house during the time frame when Kate lived there (which would have been after he moved out!).I also felt like the ending of the movie was really rushed and left a lot of loose ends (like Kate's boyfriend!) hanging.  While I love a good chick flick, I also like a clean ending.Overall, a nice movie if you're in a sappy mood on a Friday night and just want a quick (98 minutes) film to take in.

Nevertheless, there are some strong similarities between ""The Lake House"" and ""Heaven."" Both are supernatural tales about fate and the inevitability of true love, and how love can transcend the material world of here and now.""Just Like Heaven"" was based on a book written by Marc Levy. In the book, the male protagonist is an architect who falls in love with the spirit of a female doctor. In the film version, the male lead (Marc Ruffalo) is a landscape architect and the female (Reese Witherspoon) remains a doctor. In ""The Lake House,"" Keanu Reeves plays an architect who develops a relationship with a doctor (Sandra Bullock) by sending her mail that goes through a timewarp. Is all this similarity a coincidence?Unfortunately, while the story, direction, acting, cinematography and even the music came together to make a near masterpiece in ""Just Like Heaven,"" the same cannot be said for ""The Lake House.""Although Keanu Reeves is fine, Sandra Bullock is miscast and there doesn't seem to be any real chemistry between the two. There is something a bit too hard and un-feminine about Ms. Bullock. Watching her, I couldn't help but think how much she reminded me of Christopher Guest's character in Spinal Tap, Nigel Tufnel. And when mail arrives in the Lake House's magic mailbox, the little red flag pops up in a way that is almost unintentionally funny. (I'm being kind when I say ""almost"".)Even the film's ""love theme"" - Paul McCartney's ""This Never Happened Before"" - doesn't seem to fit well at the various points in the movie that it is played.Despite it's problems, ""The Lake House"" is still worth watching.

1014096,A2K4HN6EECBNR3,B000HEWEE4,"Jean Baldridge  Yates ""jean, jewelry designer...","[8, 9]","There are many classic, beloved Hollywood romances from the forties era which this movie reminded me of. Interestingly, in two different scenes in The Lake House, you are shown a black and white clip from a forties Cary Grant/Ingrid Bergman movie where they are sharing a passionate kiss. Two great screen lovers setting the tone for what its all about: love with a capitol L. You even get an education concerning Jane Austin's novel Persuasion concerning the value of the virtue of patience in waiting for your true love.This movie reminds me most of The Portait of Jenny, a lovely fantasy starring Joseph Cotton and Jennifer Jones. In that film, the character played by Jennifer Jones ""grows up"" right in from of Jospeh Cotton's eyes, and they fall in love when she becomes an adult. It has the same dreamy quality which The Lake House has. It plays with time, dancing back and forth, in the same manner, and the viewer cannot help but become engaged by the theme of time and all its potential concerning profound love. With that sort of true love, after all, why must there be rules?I got a good feeling immediately right from the beginning of this movie, as Sandra Bullock, who plays Kate, leaves the lake house with her dog, Jack, and pulls onto the road. I knew that something was up right away, as the rural landscape shifted subtlety, and it was clear that time had passed in some mysterious form...there was snow on the ground which hadn't been there a moment before. The seasons had changed in that instant, and the blue truck, which Keanu Reeves' character, Alex, drives throughout the movie, is seen coming in from a secondary road, headed toward the lake house.The viewer soon discovers that the main characters are both inhabiting the lake house exactly two years apart, and they begin to fall in love through the letters they leave for each other in the old mailbox at the top of the walkway to the house. They share Jack, the dog, but they can't seem to meet in what is called real time, as hard as they try. How will this be solved? Will love overcome the obstacle of right place, wrong time?As with the modern romance, Meet Joe Black, starring Brad Pitt, you must be willing to embrace non-reality totally. I grew up reading fairy tales, so I had a wonderful time watching this movie. I recommend it for many reasons. Not only did I think that the acting was good, and I liked watching Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, I enjoyed the fantastic visit to Chicago via the setting of the film.

They are both nice.One day Alex and Mona happened to meet Morgan and he invited them to his girlfriend's (Kate's) birthday party.Alex knew Kate is that Kate that he's writing to. But Kate didn't realize he was that Alex.He talked to her about one book. They kissed each other.Morgan and Mona found them kissing. Morgan was upset and Mona looked sad.Alex seems to completely fall in love with Kate.Kate first realized that he was that Alex  when she's having her another birthday after two years.She was mad at him as he didn't tell her.One day Alex got a call from Henly, his younger brother and knew that his father had been in a hospital due to his heat attack.Alex couldn't completely forgive what his father had done to his mother.After several days(?) his father passed away while his father was processing to publish a book.Kate sent him the father's book as a present to consolate him for his father's dead.Alex couldn't stop his desire of dating with Kate. Alex and Kate was going to date.But Alex skipped. He hadn't come. Kate was pitty.After that despite of no response from Kate, Alex was writing to her over and over.The strange relationship between Alex and Kate seems to be broken.After about a year, Morgan and Kate came to live together.Alex visited Morgan and left the key of the lake house and Jack as he believed these were what Kate needed.He began to ready to open a company with Henly.Although only one device to connect between Alex and Kate was the post at the lake house so far, the device flexibily turns something. like from space over the ceiling to space under the floor.She must have  had still mixed feelings.But she seems to have thought that Morgan likes me. Alex didn't come.I pick Morgan.After her decision, Kate realized a guy who died in her arm two years ago was Alex at the time.She looks nearly panicking and tried to save him. Morgan tried to stop her. She couldn't hear anyting.And the flexible device did work.Finally Alex and Kate could see each other again.There is two years's difference between that Alex and that Kate.the Story could be said it's messed up. but i like it.Keanu's eyes shows me he was shocked and still unable to overcome his mother's death in lonesome and what his dad did to her.The last scene Alex kissed Kate for so long. I can understand he waited for this moment for over two years.But honestly, I shockingly watched it. Hug or short one might be better for me.Henly seems to be perturbed by Alex as he keeps loving an unrealistic woman.

The story begins as Sandra and dog are leaving the Lake House, a gorgeous all-glass house that is located on and over a piece of a lake, near the shore. Separated from land by a tiny bridge cross, she hesitates at her mailbox to place a letter in it, then drives away in what looks like my first car, a 1968 gold Mustang (except mine had a white convertible top). We next see Keanu pull up to the Lake House in a 1968 ? pickup truck.  Bits of snow are on the ground.Back in Chicago, Sandra reports to her new assignment as Dr. (Kate) Forster at Chicago City Hospital.  At a construction site, architect Keanu (Alex) tells us that he has bought the Lake House.  As Alex moves in, he checks the mail box, finding a letter from Kate, as the former tenant, providing her new address and asking the ""new owner"" to forward her mail if he receives any of it. A scraggy dog soon shows up and runs into the Lake House.  We soon see the same scruffy dog with Kate.  (What is going on here?)Kate is back at the Lake House, retrieves a letter from Alex to her, from the mailbox.  He tells her the Lake House was empty for years and asks if she meant her letter for someone else.  She writes back, placing another letter for Alex in the Lake House mailbox and she just happens to mention that it is 2006.  Alex shows up at the address Kate gave him to hand-deliver a letter, but there is an empty lot, with luxury apartments scheduled to be built.  He returns home (to the Lake House) and drops the letter in the mailbox, telling her it is 2004.  She replies with a dated photo, telling him of a freak snowstorm from April 3, 2004 when everyone got sick.When the snow storm appears on that date, Alex's interest is obviously peaked.  They begin to correspond regularly, by dropping letters in the Lake House mailbox, although both do not understand how it is possible.  The dog's name is Jack, and both of Alex and Kate seem to share Jack.  It is very interesting to see the play of how things work around time in the movie as Alex and Kate fall in love from a distance.  A sub-plot is Alex and his brother's relationship with their grouchy, cold, unaffectionate father, played by veteran actor Christopher Plummer.Is this romance just an impossible fantasy?  Can time be bent, somehow, to cross the paths of two people who are two years apart?  Is there hope?  Is anything REALLY impossible; or is it just highly improbable (as my brother used to say)?Personally, I think ALL things are possible.",5,"""Across Time and Space""",1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,2619,"['Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'together', 'again', 'bring', 'love', 'story', 'man-made', 'boundaries', 'time', 'space', 'story', 'Sandra', 'dog', 'are', 'leaving', 'Lake', 'House', 'gorgeous', 'all-glass', 'house', 'located', 'piece', 'lake', 'shore', 'Separated', 'land', 'tiny', 'bridge', 'cross', 'mailbox', 'place', 'letter', 'then', 'away', 'what', 'first', 'car', '1968', 'gold', 'Mustang', 'mine', 'had', 'white', 'convertible', 'top', 'next', 'see', 'Keanu', 'pull', 'up', 'Lake', 'House', '1968', 'pickup', 'truck', 'Bits', 'snow', 'are', 'ground.Back', 'Chicago', 'Sandra', 'new', 'assignment', 'Dr.', 'Kate', 'Forster', 'Chicago', 'City', 'Hospital', 'construction', 'site', 'architect', 'Keanu', 'Alex', 'bought', 'Lake', 'House', 'Alex', 'mail', 'box', 'finding', 'letter', 'Kate', 'former', 'tenant', 'providing', 'new', 'address', 'asking', 'new', 'owner', 'forward', 'mail', 'scraggy', 'dog', 'soon', 'up', 'runs', 'Lake', 'House', 'soon', 'see', 'same', 'scruffy', 'dog', 'Kate', 'What', 'going', 'here', 'Kate', 'back', 'Lake', 'House', 'letter', 'Alex', 'mailbox', 'Lake', 'House', 'was', 'empty', 'years', 'meant', 'letter', 'someone', 'else', 'back', 'placing', 'letter', 'Alex', 'Lake', 'House', 'mailbox', 'just', 'mention', '2006', 'Alex', 'up', 'address', 'Kate', 'gave', 'hand-deliver', 'letter', 'empty', 'lot', 'luxury', 'apartments', 'scheduled', 'be', 'built', 'home', 'Lake', 'House', 'letter', 'mailbox', 'telling', '2004', 'dated', 'photo', 'telling', 'freak', 'snowstorm', 'April', '3', '2004', 'when', 'everyone', 'got', 'snow', 'storm', 'date', 'Alex', 'interest', 'obviously', 'peaked', 'begin', 'correspond', 'regularly', 'dropping', 'letters', 'Lake', 'House', 'mailbox', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'possible', 'dog', 'name', 'Jack', 'Alex', 'Kate', 'seem', 'share', 'Jack', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'play', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'around', 'time', 'movie', 'Alex', 'Kate', 'fall', 'love', 'distance', 'sub-plot', 'Alex', 'brother', 'relationship', 'grouchy', 'cold', 'unaffectionate', 'father', 'played', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'Plummer.Is', 'romance', 'just', 'impossible', 'fantasy', 'Can', 'time', 'be', 'bent', 'somehow', 'cross', 'paths', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'two', 'years', 'apart', 'hope', 'anything', 'REALLY', 'impossible', 'just', 'highly', 'improbable', 'brother', 'used', 'say', 'Personally', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'possible']",N/A

""The Lake House"" is very surreal like good fantasy -- but also very real like good sci-fi. Beware of general spoilers following below.The time-warp entanglement is developed in a well-done balance supporting the developing romance and being supported by this romance. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves build their on-screen romance in a fine but passionate dance of feelings -- helping greatly to re-enforce the whole movie. But all the actors and acting are in sync with this. The mood of the changing [and unchanging] settings is also in good sync with the flow of the story. In particular I like the usage of several aspects of time-linkage to provide looser to closer connectivity -- the dog, the house and the mailbox are all involved in this cross-time connectivity -- as well as Alex and Kate linking-up via those elements and more direct ones such as shared inner voices, nearly shared presences and total shared presence -- in the same place-and-time at last. All these cross-time-linkage aspects are juggled spot-on to build this fine romance. The story is kept moving at good speed but is still easy to follow -- and the details do clue-in the development without total certainty.

But like everyone else, I respond viscerally to any movie that pairs Keanu Reeves with Sandra Bullock.  The two of them should star in all movies, in any year--2004, 2006, or now.  Think of how many films would have been much improved if only Reeves and Bullock had been available to take the title parts.  I'm thinking of MULHOLLAND DR, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, THE ICE AGE, even something like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN could have used Sandra Bullock playing the part Anne Hathaway did and tempting Keanu Reeves with her knowledge of rodeo driving.But my questions were more about, what is with the strange brother of Keanu Reeves, Henry, and his leonine hairline which looks as though hair grows out of his head backwards and gets crimped there?  Where did they find this actor, or the woman who plays Sandra's mother?  For her part, the producers might have been turned down by Marsha Mason so they decided to get the ""foreign"" Marsha Mason, with her odd Dutch or Malaysian accent but all of Marsha Mason's botox plumping out her face like a pin cushion.(SPOILERS AHEAD.)It made me uncomfortable all the time she was around, even discounting the fact that I believe the mother (played by Willeke van Ammelrooy) made that bus run over Keanu Reeves as she sat with her daughter at Dealey Plaza and realized, when she lifted her gaze and saw Alex Wyler begin to approach, that this was the man who would once and for all take Sandra away from her at last.  Did anyone else get this, or am I just reading into things?  Notice that once Keane and Sandra get together, you never see the mother again.(END OF SPOILERS.)I believe that the movie calls out for a sequel in which Keanu's character, Alex Wyler, and his architect brother, Henry (played by Ebon Moss-Bachrach) would use their newfound time travel powers to go back and save the life of their mother, the woman who broke Christopher Plummer's heart and who condemned her two boys to live lives of meaningless hedonism and avant-garde architecture.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[1, 1]","When I first saw the previews for the Lake House I thought the plot was completely implausible and that there was no way I could possibly enjoy such a far-fetched romance. I was wrong. Sandra Bullock plays an overworked doctor at a busy Chicago hospital who finds solace on her time off by visiting her lake house. Keanu Reeves plays an architect whose father build the lakehouse, and who lives in it at the same time as Bullock, though two years earlier. The two correspond through letters placed in the mailbox and develop an affection for each other that transcends time. After awhile they begin to make plans to meet each other in Reeves' future and Bullock's present, but their plans just keep falling through. They begin to wonder if time is a barrier that they can't overcome.So while the two-year time difference may seem like it would make the love story hard to follow, it completely makes sense within the context of this film. These two people are living completely different lives and the only thing they have in common is this house, which for both of them is a source of solace and peace in their otherwise hectic lives. The way they fall in love is completely believable and I couldn't help but hope that they would be able to overcome the distance that time placed between them and find a way to be together in the present. Even if you don't typically like love stories, I'd suggest giving the Lake House a try.

1014126,A19RAJY6R7USN0,B000HEWEE4,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[10, 13]","The Lake House is a romantic drama focusing on a relationship through time. Keanu Reeves is in 2004 and Sandra Bullock is in 2006 and they are able to communicate in writing letters because of a magical mailbox. Simple really. The complications come however when they try to meet.I have read several reviews pointing out the time travel plotholes of this film - only thing is I think those people are misunderstanding the rules of this film. The rules in this film are that the time periods are moving in the same way. For instance, as a made-up example, if it is March 12 2004 and March 12 2006, if it is a day later in 2004 (March 13), then it is also a day later in 2006 (March 13). Understood? Ok good. Now at the beginning of the movie Sandra Bullock doesn't have any memories of Keanu Reeves, yet later on he meets her in her past. Now one might argue- how come she didn't remember this at the beginning? Well sceptics, this film establishes that we are always moving forward and focusing on the here and now. So later when Sandra Bullock suddenly remembers because of both times moving forward in sync we can accept that the change may be sudden. If we were to focus on knowing that Sandra Bullock did know Keanu at the beginning because of his new actions in the past then we'd be going into parallel universe territory- the creators of The Lake House have chosen to avoid that for the purpose of this film- again an acceptable choice.For people who haven't seen The Lake House nothing I've just written may have made sense, and maybe I didn't write it correctly, but all in all The Lake House follows a set of rules that are different to most other time travel films, and once we as the audience accept that we can simply be swept away by the world of The Lake House.The chemistry between Keanu and Sandra is great, especially when they meet when they were never supposed to, and the tension and timing of the movie is as it should be.

The two begin corresponding only to discover that they are living two years apart, Alex in 2004 and Kate in 2006. The movie progresses and the two eventually decide to meet but its two weeks for Kate and two years for Alex. It's a heartbreaker because if time is not on your side it is not on your side.A series of coincidences bring keep bringing Kate and Alex together.

Well, you have to see the film.  Possibly, a mailbox plays a more central role in this film than it ever will in any other.The art direction, the low key acting, the total romance of ""The Lake House"" have made the film memorable to me, always in instant recall, just like ""The Notebook"".  Notwithstanding that I am not a Keanu Reeves fan, I believe that the coupling of Reeves with Bullock in this film was more than just a casting stunt.  I believe they have an immediate chemistry on film together that Reeves doesn't get with anyone else, and Sandra doesn't quite achieve with other partners.  With other leading men, notably Hugh Grant and Bill Pullman (her partner in one of the all time great romances, ""While You Were Sleeping""), Bullock reverts to romantic comedy.  Here, the romance is in earnest, her feelings more real than sparkly;  the message is about relationships, and the humanity involved in maintaining them.An excellent, quiet film...not to be missed!",5,Excellent use of foreshadowing - Reeves & Bullock ought to make a film together more often.,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,1359,"['been', 'rough', 'summer', 'movie', 'going', 'Normally', 'attend', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'week', 'nothing', 'summer', 'fare', 'really', 'held', 'interest', 'exception', 'film', 'Lake', 'House', 'Having', 'seen', 'trailers', 'was', 'puzzled', 'plot', 'evolve', 'time', 'complex', 'describe', 'when', 'are', 'playing', 'past', 'past', 'future', 'now', 'Well', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'Possibly', 'mailbox', 'more', 'central', 'role', 'film', 'ever', 'will', 'other.The', 'art', 'direction', 'low', 'key', 'acting', 'total', 'romance', 'Lake', 'House', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'memorable', 'always', 'instant', 'recall', 'just', 'Notebook', 'Notwithstanding', 'am', 'not', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'fan', 'believe', 'coupling', 'Reeves', 'Bullock', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'casting', 'stunt', 'believe', 'have', 'immediate', 'chemistry', 'film', 'together', 'Reeves', ""n't"", 'get', 'anyone', 'else', 'Sandra', ""n't"", 'quite', 'achieve', 'other', 'partners', 'other', 'leading', 'men', 'notably', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'partner', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'romances', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'Bullock', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Here', 'romance', 'earnest', 'feelings', 'more', 'real', 'sparkly', 'message', 'relationships', 'humanity', 'involved', 'maintaining', 'them.An', 'excellent', 'quiet', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

Sandra Bullock is beautifully measured as Kate Forster, the caring, intelligent, but lonely doctor who is new in town and a bit out of sorts with the world (there is a believable chemistry between them).The support roles are nicely fleshed out too - the ever-accomplished Christopher Plummer is superb as Keanu's distant and overly-precise architect dad (who built ""The Lake House"") and the deeply beautiful Iranian actress Shoreh Aghdashloo plays Anna the head of ward in Kate's hospital. The boss/doctor relationship between them is deftly handled - both in the work scenes, in the lunch-breaks and in the bars after work...People have also poo-pooed the 'letters across time' storyline of Kate in 2006 and Alex in 2004, but I found it refreshing and a very clever angle in a romantic film that takes its time - and savours the lovely moments rather than squander them.""The Lake House"" is a nice watch - and the Blu Ray print adds hugely to the cityscapes of downtown Chicago and the out-of-state location shots too.

1014145,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000HEWEE4,Mark,"[7, 12]","Director Alejandro Agresti chose a strange time to release The Lake House, in the middle of summer blockbusters, but it did reach an audience, and it did crack the top five at least once.  This film is not genuine Oscar considerable material, but it is a film that is constantly entertaining from beginning to end.  Before I get to the actual review, I want to step back and address the issue of the sort of ""time travel"" aspects of the film.  In a film where time travel is the main plot, such as Timecop and The Terminator, it is hard to look at the film without noticing flaws in time travel theories.  However, I ask you, the viewer, to see only time travel as a key to the strong and solid relationship between the characters in this film.  Do not get caught up in looking at the flaws dealing with the two different years, or how they have the same dog, or how any of this works.  Mainly look at how the relationship develops between Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) and Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock).That being said, here is the review.  Architect Alex Wyler and doctor Kate Forster live in the same lake house, only Alex occupies the house in 2004, and Kate in 2006.  Alex discovers a letter left by Kate in the mailbox claiming that she is the previous owner of the house.  The only problem is that the dates don't match up on their letters.  It doesn't take them long to discover that they are living in two seperate times, and neither of them seem to really be phased by this idea.  Alex is a bachelor who does not seem to mind, and Kate is single, with an on-and-off relationship.  The two begin writing back and forth, and Kate is able to predict the weather for Alex.  It is difficult to review this film, because every thing that I say puts another piece of the puzzle into perspective, and I would rather have you have the fun of putting it together yourself.  All I have to say about this film is that it is definitely one of my favorite films so far this year, although its not one of the best films of the year.  The performances are spectacular, both Reeves and Bullock, but the best performance comes from the always superb Christopher Plummer as Alex's stubborn architect father.  Plummer, like actors such as Chris Cooper, specializes in supporting performances, and he is still producing great work.  The dialogue is smart, often funny, and the actors pull it off splendidly.  The Lake House could have been a sappy, illogical film, but the filmmakers and actors took on this project with such mastery that I couldn't help but be entertained.  The twists in the end are subtle, and they don't jerk the film in another direction; they mainly function along side of the film, going with the natural flow of events.  This is a sweet and well written romance, and it might be one of the best romances in quite some time.",4,"Finally, a great Romance for the year",1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,2833,"['Director', 'Alejandro', 'Agresti', 'chose', 'strange', 'time', 'release', 'Lake', 'House', 'middle', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'did', 'reach', 'audience', 'did', 'crack', 'top', 'five', 'least', 'once', 'film', 'not', 'genuine', 'Oscar', 'considerable', 'material', 'film', 'constantly', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'end', 'get', 'actual', 'review', 'want', 'step', 'back', 'address', 'issue', 'sort', 'time', 'travel', 'aspects', 'film', 'film', 'where', 'time', 'travel', 'main', 'plot', 'such', 'Timecop', 'Terminator', 'hard', 'look', 'film', 'noticing', 'flaws', 'time', 'travel', 'theories', 'However', 'ask', 'viewer', 'see', 'only', 'time', 'travel', 'key', 'strong', 'solid', 'relationship', 'characters', 'film', 'Do', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'looking', 'flaws', 'dealing', 'two', 'different', 'years', 'how', 'have', 'same', 'dog', 'how', 'works', 'Mainly', 'look', 'how', 'relationship', 'Alex', 'Wyler', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Kate', 'Forster', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'being', 'said', 'here', 'review', 'Architect', 'Alex', 'Wyler', 'doctor', 'Kate', 'Forster', 'live', 'same', 'lake', 'house', 'only', 'Alex', 'house', '2004', 'Kate', '2006', 'Alex', 'letter', 'left', 'Kate', 'mailbox', 'claiming', 'previous', 'owner', 'house', 'only', 'problem', 'dates', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'letters', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'discover', 'are', 'living', 'two', 'seperate', 'times', 'seem', 'really', 'be', 'phased', 'idea', 'Alex', 'bachelor', 'who', 'not', 'seem', 'mind', 'Kate', 'single', 'on-and-off', 'relationship', 'two', 'begin', 'writing', 'back', 'forth', 'Kate', 'able', 'predict', 'weather', 'Alex', 'difficult', 'review', 'film', 'thing', 'say', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'perspective', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'have', 'fun', 'putting', 'together', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'performances', 'are', 'spectacular', 'Reeves', 'Bullock', 'best', 'performance', 'always', 'superb', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Alex', 'stubborn', 'architect', 'father', 'Plummer', 'actors', 'such', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'supporting', 'performances', 'still', 'producing', 'great', 'work', 'dialogue', 'smart', 'often', 'funny', 'actors', 'pull', 'off', 'splendidly', 'Lake', 'House', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sappy', 'illogical', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'took', 'project', 'such', 'mastery', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'entertained', 'twists', 'end', 'are', 'subtle', 'do', ""n't"", 'jerk', 'film', 'direction', 'mainly', 'function', 'side', 'film', 'going', 'natural', 'flow', 'events', 'sweet', 'well', 'written', 'romance', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'romances', 'quite', 'time']",N/A

If you want to enjoy it, you must forget about logic, and be ready to overlook quite a few inconsistencies in the plot. Provided that you do exactly that, you will enjoy an engaging and thoroughly delightful romantic movie that will leave a smile on your face.From my point of view, the main theme of ""The lake house"" is the existence of a soulmate for everybody, and whether we are ready (and able) to wait in order to meet the person that completes us. Kate (Sandra Bullock), who along with Alex is one of the two main characters of this movie, asks herself the question everybody has asked himself at least once, ""What if you live your life and no one is waiting?"". I suppose the only valid answer is to have hope, and go on searching.But I digress... I would like to point out that for Kate and Alex (Keanu Reeves), the problem of meeting their other half is even more complicated than for us. You don't believe me? You can't conceive of someone with more problems than you in your search of the ""right"" person? Well, you should take into account  that Alex Wyler and Kate Forster have our same problems, but also need to struggle with the fact that they live at the same place, in different years. And yes, you read that well, but please remember you need to suspend your disbelief for the duration of this film, if you want to enjoy it.The way in which Alex and Kate get in contact with each other, and fall in love, is strange, and whimsical. It doesn't make sense, but... when did logic become an obligation? ""The lake house"" is a magical movie that entertains, and can completely charm the right spectator. Are you that person? Are you interested in their story, and on whether they will overcome the obstacles before them in order to be together? If that is the case, just rent or buy this movie.All in all, I can say I really liked ""The lake house"", and I highly recommend it to those that like romantic films, and don't feel uncomfortable when fiction doesn't follow reality closely. This movie is not for everybody, but if you know what you are getting into and still decide to go ahead and watch, you will love it.Belen Alcat",4,"""What if you live your life and no one is waiting?""",1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,2217,"['lake', 'house', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Agresti', 'not', 'film', 'everybody', 'want', 'enjoy', 'must', 'forget', 'logic', 'be', 'ready', 'overlook', 'quite', 'few', 'inconsistencies', 'plot', 'Provided', 'do', 'exactly', 'will', 'enjoy', 'engaging', 'thoroughly', 'delightful', 'romantic', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'smile', 'face.From', 'point', 'view', 'main', 'theme', 'lake', 'house', 'existence', 'soulmate', 'everybody', 'are', 'ready', 'able', 'wait', 'order', 'meet', 'person', 'Kate', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'Alex', 'one', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'question', 'everybody', 'asked', 'least', 'once', 'What', 'live', 'life', 'one', 'waiting', 'suppose', 'only', 'valid', 'answer', 'have', 'hope', 'go', 'searching.But', 'digress', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'problem', 'meeting', 'other', 'half', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'conceive', 'someone', 'more', 'problems', 'search', 'right', 'person', 'Well', 'should', 'take', 'account', 'Alex', 'Wyler', 'Kate', 'Forster', 'have', 'same', 'problems', 'also', 'need', 'struggle', 'fact', 'live', 'same', 'place', 'different', 'years', 'yes', 'read', 'well', 'please', 'remember', 'need', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'duration', 'film', 'want', 'enjoy', 'it.The', 'way', 'Alex', 'Kate', 'get', 'contact', 'other', 'fall', 'love', 'strange', 'whimsical', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'did', 'logic', 'become', 'obligation', 'lake', 'house', 'magical', 'movie', 'can', 'completely', 'charm', 'right', 'spectator', 'Are', 'person', 'Are', 'interested', 'story', 'will', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'order', 'be', 'together', 'case', 'just', 'rent', 'buy', 'movie.All', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'lake', 'house', 'highly', 'recommend', 'like', 'romantic', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'when', 'fiction', ""n't"", 'follow', 'reality', 'closely', 'movie', 'not', 'everybody', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'still', 'decide', 'go', 'ahead', 'watch', 'will', 'love', 'it.Belen', 'Alcat']",N/A

1014155,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B000HEWEE4,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[0, 0]","I've only been going on about this film since I originally heard about it, probably before they started filming, when it was announced, and was called ""Il Mare"". I loved both actors in Speed, and have since been a fan of both of them, although they can be forgiven for some of their film choices (hello, Two Weeks Notice!) They had such great chemistry in Speed, but I was actually doubtful about the renamed Lake House, as from the plot, it didn't sound like they spent much time together in the film. In fact, it sounded quite similar to Sleepless In Seattle. I was pleasantly surprised, as though the storyline keeps them apart for a fair chunk of the film, they do end up talking.The whole storyline is somehow, Keanu's character Alex, and Sandra's character Kate, both lived in the same house, but at different times. Alex is in 2004, Kate is in 2006. Yet they manage to correspond, each disbelieving at first that they live two years apart. Then through various letters, somehow, they fall in love. (Or lust, whatever, bearing in mind they haven't physically seen each other.) They try and figure out a way to be together, they work out a date they're going to meet each other on, but Alex doesn't turn up. (You need to pay attention to the beginning of the film to understand why he doesn't turn up.) Then they both realise they've met in the past and various other incidents - Kate left a book at the train station, and she tells Alex to go and get it, and when she forgets it, she sees him picking up her forgotten book.The plot can sometimes be a bit far fetched, I'm still not sure about the ending. Not only was it a bit too Hollywood - although I think I would have cried if it had been any other way and that would have been embarrassing - but I think by the end it was actually set in 2008! But then it would have meant Kate's character was in 2010 - oh I'm confused!The only thing that really bugged me about this film was Sandra's hair. What possessed her to get her hair cut that short?! Dear God. But thankfully, now she seems to be putting on a little weight, marriage must be suiting her. She's still skinny, she always will be, but she's looking better.Suspension of disbelief is a really wonderful thing. It's quite good that's it's used in a romantic film. The plot is about connecting with your soulmate, the one that is right for you, especially when you feel isolated. Who hasn't felt they've waited too long to find the perfect someone, or felt alone at a crowded party.The reviewers who claim ""bad acting"" - shut up. There's always gonna be someone out there who slags off Keanu for his acting skills, but why are you watching it if you're just gonna write a review and slate his acting?See this film with someone you love. It'll open your eyes to what could possibly happen, what would happen if you never met them, and will make you look at them differently. It's an excellent, magical film, and I will be definitely preordering it when it comes out on DVD. And it's good to see Keanu & Sandra lighting up the big screen again.

1014163,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000HEWEE4,mirasreviews,"[7, 8]","""The Lake House"" is a supernatural romance that doesn't allow its paranormal premise to overwhelm the story of distant lovers. The movie's centerpiece, a striking glass and steel home built on stilts over a lake outside of Chicago, brings an ephemeral, metaphorical beauty to the film and leads its architectural theme. Though neither the Lake House nor Chicago's architectural features are essential to the love story, an emphasis on buildings injects atmosphere and places the romance against a background of large, sweeping structures that endure the disparity in time that the characters cannot. ""The Lake House"" was inspired by the South Korean film ""Il Mare"" (2000) and written by Pulitzer Prize winner David Auburn. Instead of the conventional difficulties of distance, class, or circumstance that often separate would-be lovers, time itself comes between the occupants of the Lake House.Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) has completed her residency and moved to Chicago to take her first job as a full-fledged doctor in a busy city hospital. It's with some sadness that she leaves the beautiful glass lake house overlooking water and surrounded by trees that she's been renting. She leaves a note in the mailbox for the new tenant as she drives away. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), a frustrated architect whose father built the house, moves in and reads Kate's note, which makes little sense to him. Puzzled, he writes back to say that he is the first occupant of the lake house in years. Kate insists that she only recently moved out of the house and asks him to forward her mail to an address in Chicago, which Alex finds is an empty lot where an apartment building is to be built. It seems that 2 years separates these two people, whose correspondence through the lake house's time-warping mail box brings them close. Kate and Alex long to meet, but is it possible to surmount a gap in time?I'm not normally a fan of romance, but this script impressed me. It wisely doesn't dwell on the odd properties of the mailbox or allow the characters to be preoccupied with figuring that out. The intricate control of information -how much each of the characters and the audience knows- is normally the domain of suspense films, not romances. But ""The Lake House"" takes place in two different times, and the audience is not all-seeing. Constructing the story is an exercise in the control of information, and David Auburn did a superb job of it. Kate, who lives 2 years later than Alex, naturally has more information. But Alex's communication with the future gives him a leg up on his present, so in some contexts he knows more. In addition to developing a  warm relationship between these two people, ""The Lake House"" poses a puzzle in which the characters and the audience endeavor to understand how these two people two years apart fit together as time marches on. This made the story more interesting to me than the average romance.The outcome of ""The Lake House"" isn't as predictable as the average romance either, but director Alejandro Agresti handled the final scene poorly. It doesn't have the emotional impact that it should. And, watching the scene, it is obvious how it should have played out to give this movie the ending that it deserves. That said, ""The Lake House"" is an enjoyable romance with a clever structure, lovely architecture, and a placid tone. If you're wondering about the lake house, itself: It was constructed for the movie full scale, over a man-made lake and dismantled after filming was completed.

The man lives in his present and the lady lives in her present, but actually he is in the past and she is in the present or she is in the future and he is in the present.  Are you confused yet?All you need to know is that this just simply is a classic love story, with a time twist to it.Of course, it's more complicated than that.  When will they meet?  Did they meet already?  Why didn't they meet?  Can you change his history and her future?  Perhaps she met him already, but she didn't know it.  Is death permanent? Is destiny determined or can it be changed?  But hasn't fate already cast its fortune?That's enough questions, possibilities, probabilities, and uncertainties.  Perhaps you need to crack a fortune cookie to tell them what to do.  But they don't need a piece of paper from a cookie to do that.They do need a letter, though, from a mailbox at the Lake House.  The film actually uses a mailbox to function as the time traveling element.  Put a letter in the mailbox and it immediately shifts the letter from one time period to another.Yes, it is the mailbox that acts to put them together on a certain destiny.  But then it is through their own actions that they change their destiny by using the mailbox.Finally, I read some of the earliest reviews, complaining that the story was slow and plodding.

1014205,A3QGUMI8OB4CCJ,B000HEWEE4,Robert A. Keeler,"[0, 1]","No plot description; everyone knows it by now. Just some personal thoughts.The other day, my wife & I, both being Sandra Bullock fans, settled down to watch - even as I thought: ""Oh no, another chick flick"". We loved it, regardless of the brain-bursting impossibilities & plot-holes. Many pages of website comments show that most have the same affection for TLH, even as they lambast it for its absurdities - in spite of 2/3 of ""Rotten Tomato"" critics shouting it down. Why these viewer reactions?I'm an analytical sort of guy, so I organized my thoughts.(1.) STAR POWER: though Sandra (Kate) provides the major horsepower which pulls the audience through to the end, Keanu (Alex) holds up his end. Some criticize him as being ""wooden"", but ""restrained"" is better. It suits the whole mood of the movie.(2.) ""ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER"": We have an instinct to root for this pair & ignore whatever pot-holes (plot-holes?) stand in their way.(3.) PRODUCTION STYLE: Smooth, & steady; a metaphor for the inexorable passage of time that these folks endure. Every scene makes its impact without resorting to flashy, special effects - which would be inappropriate to the movie's style - although, by golly, some subtle ""markers"" clarifying the chronology would have helped. The realistic Chicago locations impart a subliminal sense of ""This might really happen"" - which helps, Lord knows. As for the house itself, it's just a fairy-tale concept, totally impractical. Hard to heat, and where's the sewer pipe?(4.) RESTRAINED ACTING: Well suited to the elegaic, reflective mood of the story. Film students take note: the scene close to the end, in the architect's office. Kate spies the drawing of the lake house & is drawn to it as Boy Friend impatiently waits to depart. Kate, approaching the drawing, gives him a slight, backward ""good-bye"" wave. With this one gesture, we know instantly that Boy Friend is history. When told that Alex is the artist & do you know him? she smiles slightly & whispers ""Oh...yeah..."" She gently runs her hand over the picture frame, the gesture of one lover caressing the other, in absentia. When told that Alex is dead, her close-up is a masterpiece of subtlety, her expression conveys all the shattering emotion we know she feels, without any operatic hysteria & tears. LESS is truly MORE.(5.)MUSIC: Most film scores do not stand up well when severed from the screen image. Not this one. Composer Rachel Portman's exquisite music (available on CD)  caresses every scene, wrapping them all in an irresistible mood of tender nostalgia. It casts a spell which smooths over all the plot rough spots, so that only the hardest heart is left unmoved. The CD is a winner; it provides ""mood music"" in the very best sense of the words.Though TLH disappointed at the box office, I suspect it will creep up the lists of ""Favorite Film Romances"". Critic Roger Ebert gave it 3-1/2 stars (Wowee!) He liked it for its romantic heart. Concerning its absurdities, he shouted ""Never mind! Just never mind"". I agree.HOWEVER...Everyone - Sandy, director Agresti, editors Klingman & Brodersohn, writer Auburn - should get a sharp rap upside the head with a rolled-up script & told never to do this sort of thing again. We've cut some slack for TLH, but that's it!As of this writing ""Premonition"" is looming over the horizon.

1014207,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B000HEWEE4,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[3, 4]","""The Lake House"" is one of those romantic movies that require such a suspension of disbelief that it might as well be catalogued in the fantasy, sci fi or superhero collections of your local video store.  This is due to the central fact that, since all romances require an apparently insurmountable obstacle for the lovers to overcome, Lake House complies by having the lovers, Keanu Reeves and a never lovelier Sandra Bullock, separated in time and space by two years.Taking a page out of Steven King's playbook, whereby odd things are never explained ...they just ARE...a mailbox becomes the lovers' unusual conduit to one another as they send missives across time and experience the odd sensation of standing in the EXACT same spot in the three physical dimensions, but two years apart in the all-important fourth.  Their task is to somehow make their love last until they can figure out a way to get not only in the same time and place physically, but emotionally as well.  It is to the two stars' credit that they are, each in his or her own way, engaging enough that the viewer stops asking ""How is this happening?"" and instead gets caught up in the quest for a resolution.The rest of the film is standard boy-meets-girl fare with no surprises.  Christopher Plummer, lately experiencing something of a career renaissance, gives an outstanding but pointless performance as Reeves' estranged father, in a subplot that adds little to the film and actually distracts from the main story, and the ""crisis"" at the end is unfortunately telegraphed 2/3 of the way through the film, so that when it actually transpires it comes across as a cheesy and unnecessary tug at the audience's heartstrings.Other than that, this is a real feel-good movie.  No important themes are explored, no great issues are resolved, and no insightful messages linger with the audience as the credits roll.  Nonetheless, this is a movie worth seeing.  Yes, the film's central plot device calls for a major league suspension of disbelief...but then so does the notion of true love itself.  Personally, I prefer to believe in both.",4,Disbelief Suspended,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,2104,"['Lake', 'House', 'one', 'romantic', 'movies', 'require', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'catalogued', 'fantasy', 'sci', 'fi', 'superhero', 'collections', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'due', 'central', 'fact', 'romances', 'require', 'apparently', 'insurmountable', 'obstacle', 'lovers', 'overcome', 'Lake', 'House', 'complies', 'having', 'lovers', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'never', 'lovelier', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'separated', 'time', 'space', 'two', 'years.Taking', 'page', 'Steven', 'King', 'playbook', 'whereby', 'odd', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'just', 'ARE', 'mailbox', 'lovers', 'unusual', 'conduit', 'one', 'send', 'missives', 'time', 'experience', 'odd', 'sensation', 'standing', 'EXACT', 'same', 'spot', 'three', 'physical', 'dimensions', 'two', 'years', 'apart', 'all-important', 'fourth', 'task', 'somehow', 'make', 'love', 'last', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'get', 'not', 'only', 'same', 'time', 'place', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'stars', 'credit', 'are', 'own', 'way', 'engaging', 'enough', 'viewer', 'asking', 'How', 'happening', 'instead', 'caught', 'up', 'quest', 'resolution.The', 'rest', 'film', 'standard', 'boy-meets-girl', 'fare', 'surprises', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'lately', 'experiencing', 'something', 'career', 'renaissance', 'outstanding', 'pointless', 'performance', 'Reeves', 'estranged', 'father', 'subplot', 'little', 'film', 'actually', 'distracts', 'main', 'story', 'crisis', 'end', 'unfortunately', 'telegraphed', '2/3', 'way', 'film', 'when', 'actually', 'cheesy', 'unnecessary', 'tug', 'audience', 'heartstrings.Other', 'real', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'important', 'themes', 'are', 'explored', 'great', 'issues', 'are', 'resolved', 'insightful', 'messages', 'linger', 'audience', 'credits', 'roll', 'Nonetheless', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Yes', 'film', 'central', 'plot', 'device', 'major', 'league', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'then', 'so', 'notion', 'true', 'love', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'believe']",N/A

1014213,AS6SH2JM2YY3H,B000HEWEE4,R S Cobblestone,"[3, 6]","The Lake House, starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, was an enjoyable film.  It will not be any kind of classic, but it will leave most viewers with a pleasant ""aftertaste"".  Keanu Reeves is a builder/architect who mysteriously begins a ""cross-time"" correspondence with Sandra Bullock, a new doctor.  Interestingly, it's not the Lake House (a house on stilts designed and built by Reeve's father) that is at the nexus of these two lives; it is the mailbox.  The mailbox is the mechanism for allowing messages to pass from Reeves (in 2004) to Bullock (in 2006).  Once they realize that they live in two different times, they demonstrate a surprising lack of interest in how or why this is happening, a bit unrealistic for two professionals (and their friends).  And apparently anything can pass in the mailbox (they pass a book and letters); what a great opportunity to pass a newspaper, flowers, jewelry... whatever!BUT... this is a love story, with a couple separated not by space, but by time.  There is a touching scene when they make a date to meet.  For him, it is a date two years in the future.  For her, it is tomorrow.  Note the resemblance to An Affair to Remember, starring Cary Grant.I thought Keanu Reeves was well cast for this movie.  Sandra Bullock was perhaps too ""relaxed"" for the physician... everything was too matter-of-fact.  All's well that ends well, and this plot ends well.I'd like to be the first to announce that the dog, Jack, was really an alien with time-warping abilities.  She (yes, Jack was a she) hid it well, and there was probably a huge alien complex hidden in the water under the Lake House causing these distortions in time.  But that's another story.

I shrugged and took it home to watch her copy, and the entire time I was watching it, I was thinking ""Why did she buy this movie?"" I won't be mean about this rating (although I laughed HARD at the one-star rating reviews--those folks should be poetry comedians with their metaphors for this film), but I will be honest. The movie is about two single people who currently have someone in their lives, but really don't want them to be there. Alex pretty much blows off the potential woman in his life, and Kate does just about the same in a harsher manner. They both end up living at a lake house two years apart and find out that both of them are traveling through time, one is going backwards and the other forward. There is a serious issue as to why they can't meet, but they can write each other. Will they eventually meet? Can they stop the serious issue?Pros: I thought the idea of writing a person you're interested in back and forth to get to know them nonphysically was such a great idea. If you can fall in love with a person's personality, chances are that it might be that much easier to fall in love with their looks (or at least accept them). From watching ""Speed,"" I already wanted them to be together (in real life too) because I think they are a very attractive couple and have great chemistry onscreen.Cons: As soon as the birthday party happened, this movie lost me altogether. Who in their right mind goes to a party, sits outside with a stranger, slow dances out of nowhere, and then starts kissing with their boyfriend not even a few feet away? The restaurant issue made me go ""So what?"" I was frustrated because I couldn't understand a word that Kate's mother was saying because her accent was incredibly heavy. I could've cared less about Kate's boyfriend because his character was stoic.  To top it off, the movie was extremely predictable.MidPoint: I gave this movie two stars instead of one (even though I didn't care for it) because the casting directors picked the right two people to do this movie. No matter how much I didn't like the plot, I still like both of these actors and their relationship on camera. I also very much enjoyed the tree symbolism and the lakehouse was beautiful (although insane to have in Chicago weather). I wouldn't dare watch the movie again, but I can see why my mother would love something like this. People who like really sappy romance movies will probably enjoy this one. Dog lovers may like it too because this movie once again made me remember why I'm mad at my real estate company for not allowing me to have a big dog.  The dog in this movie was so cute!

Two hours ago I didn't realize quite how stupid, but then I saw a movie called ""The Lake House"" in which you star. I hope that title means nothing to you yet, and that's how I'd like to keep it. That's why I'm writing to you tonight.Some time in 2005, representatives of Warner Bros, or perhaps even the great Argentine director Alejandro Agresti himself, will approach you with the script. Adapted from a successful Korean film called ""Siworae"", it will have been penned by Tony-winning writer David Auburn. But don't let that fool you. Don't be drawn in by the romance - it will be squandered on the screen. Suppress the desire for World Cinema credibility - it will not be attained. Sandra, you will be given a nice haircut, but will be forced to mope around endlessly talking to yourself and will have to confess to loving the smell of a dog's feet. Keanu, you will be given poorly-written scenes of familial angst, made to wear turtlenecks, and shot to look doughy and white.Say NO! I'm begging you! Let this material find its true cast and natural form. Say no, and set it free. Let the script float around Hollywood for a few more years. Let Carrie Fisher doctor it into a comedy. Let Warners hire Penny Marshall to direct Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Greg Kinnear, while you guys go off and do what you do best - dramedies and speculative action/sci-fi - and wait for that serious, surprising film to come along that might finally take you to the Oscar podium. Because this certainly isn't it. Call the Coen brothers. Call Scorsese. At the very least, call Soderbergh or Clooney and see what Section Eight has on the slate - they always need quality ensembles and enjoy risky, against-type casting.I know this letter probably makes little sense. How can I change the past? Surely if I'm writing this, I saw the movie, which means you made it - heedless of my advice. But I'm hoping the idiotic time-shifting logic of the movie, in which actions in the future can change the bad things about the past without affecting any of the nice things in the present, will somehow hold. If I'm right, I'll be able to logon to Amazon tomorrow and find no trace of the DVD.Please take my advice. Please say no.

She leaves a short note addressed to the next tenant asking him or her to forward her mail.  Enter Alex (Keanu Reeves) he is moving into an interesting and beautiful not recently inhabited lake house.  He finds a strange note and writes Kate back asking maybe she is mistaken.  After a series of notes back and forth Kate and Alex realize they are writing from two different time periods.Through out the movie Kate and Alex share their lives with each other through a series of letters.  The movie does a great job of making the letters seem like conversations going back and forth.

1014243,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000HEWEE4,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 10]","There is an interesting relationship at the heart of ""The Lake House"", with a good performance from Sandra Bullock, but ultimately the film cheats, unravels and lets the audience down.Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock), a new doctor, leaves the Lake House, where she lived during part of medical school. Now that she is starting her residency in Chicago, she needs to live closer to the hospital. She leaves a letter for the new tenant requesting they forward her mail. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), a condominium developer, moves into the Lake House and reads Kate's letter. But he finds that she has referred to things that aren't there. Confused, he writes her back. After a bad day at the hospital, Kate drives out to the Lake House and checks the mailbox, finding the letter from Alex. She responds and puts another letter in the mailbox. Alex sees the flag on the mailbox raise and reaches in to find Kate's letter. They soon realize something strange is happening and ask each other the date. Alex is in 2004 and Kate is in 2006. They begin a correspondence and eventually agree to meet at a trendy restaurant in 2006. At the same time, Kate has to deal with a former boyfriend who left her after he saw her kissing a guy at a party. And Alex has to deal with his office assistant, a young woman who longs to be Mrs. Wyler, or at least Mrs. Right Now. Will they ever meet in person? Can this relationship be possible?Surprisingly, given the outlandish nature of the story, ""The Lake House"", directed by Alejandro Agresti, written by David Auburn (the Pulitzer prize winning play ""Proof"", which later became a film starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins) and based on a Korean film, manages to make the relationship between Alex and Kate believable, to an extent. This is remarkable because they are almost never in the same frame of film or even the same time period. Their relationship consists of many conversations, through letters. After a while, the director and writer put them in the same locations, but for different reasons and two years apart. For instance, when Alex is visiting his father (Christopher Plummer) in the hospital, he writes a letter to Kate, who is taking a break in the same hospital cafeteria as she responds. It gives them the illusion of being in the same scene together, even though, of course, they aren't.Sandra Bullock is very good as Kate. She manages to convey the loneliness and fatigue the young doctor experiences as she begins her residency and deals with the problems of such a job. Then, when she first begins corresponding with Alex, her amusement at the idea of such a relationship is clear. She can't quite believe it, but she continues. But as she begins to reveal more to him, and vice versa, we understand why she would become involved. All of these elements add up and make her character believable. When she confides in her supervisor (Shohreh Aghdashloo, ""House of Sand and Fog"", ""American Dreamz"", TV's ""24""), we get the sense she has also had some sort of unconventional relationship, that she understands, she has sympathy. As Kate works through the various difficulties of such a relationship, her actions are believable because she is lonely, busy and unable to make a real connection with someone else.Keanu Reeves is good, but this is not the type of film he should be making. Reeves is better in science fiction and action films which require him to say little and emote even less. Neo in ""The Matrix"" trilogy is the perfect role for him. When I first heard about this film, the trailers made a point of mentioning that writer David Auburn was a Pulitzer Prize winner. When I heard this, I immediately thought `playwright' and after doing some research, I confirmed this. Often when a playwright writes a film, their dialogue still retains the feel of a play. They are two very different mediums and require different things. In a play, you need to be succinct, to capture the essence quickly. In a film, the dialogue and story need to seem more natural, allowing a little more time. I was happy to see that much of ""House"" doesn't have this problem. Reeves delivery doesn't lend itself well to this type of writing. At one point, as Alex is showing his brother the Lake House, he says ""It's beautiful. Seductive even."" Who speaks like this? On the few occasions when the writer does veer into theatrical stage territory, the actors are able to handle it and incorporate their lines into normal speech patterns. Everyone except for Reeves. When he says this line, it sounds like a teenager practicing his role in the school's production of ""Our Town"".As the film progresses, the writer and director come up with interesting ways to get Bullock and Reeves in the same scenes, in the same timeframe, but this ultimately points to a large hole in the plot. Of course, since we are talking about a story involving time travel, maybe holes in the plot are required. That said, Alex and Kate do meet a couple of times between 2004 and 2006, yet later in the film Kate doesn't seem to know who Alex is. This might be understandable if they were casual encounters, but they share a significant conversation, meet on another occasion, and more. Later, when a significant event happens, she doesn't seem to realize it was Alex. It doesn't make sense.At one point, Alex creates a walking tour of Chicago's architecture for Kate. This is a nice scene, giving them a sort of virtual date. It also shows off the charms of the city. He marks sights on a map and follows along with her, showing off the best buildings in Chicago, the buildings which caused his interest in a career in architecture.In the end, the film uses a cop out, which I can't really discuss as it would reveal the ending. Basically, the film betrays its own story and takes a complete turn in the wrong direction.Okay, I'll admit it. I cry when a Hallmark commercial plays on television. Yet, somehow, I wasn't moved by the relationship between the two leads. I was interested in their correspondence, but I never felt for them as a couple. Bullock was good and I believed she was Kate, but she is only half of the equation. Part of the problem is that they spend most of the film conversing from afar, sharing little screen time together. It makes it difficult to see them as a couple. I guess I didn't understand why Reeves would go to such great lengths to find Kate. He has women throwing themselves at him, yet he wants to carry on a written correspondence for over two years? His assistant is practically ready to jump on top of him, yet he wants to hold out for a woman he has only met a few times? I understand why Kate would be willing to pursue this relationship; as mentioned, she is lonely and extremely busy. But Alex doesn't seem to have the same problem. When they finally do get together, this should trigger waterworks and I didn't even have a moist eye.For these reasons, what starts out as a promising romantic drama falls apart.",3,The Magical

1014247,A2KUMYWXAQNARZ,B000HEWEE4,toronto,"[1, 1]","spoiler references throughout!As others have said, you either go with this movie and its premise, or you don't.  What I like about it is the overall tone of the film -- it has an autumnal, melancholy quality throughout (like an attic of old letters).  There are one or two moments that don't quite work (a couple of clunky Nora Ephron touches we could do without,  the recurring use of ""Notorious"" (of course a dull man wouldn't understand, or remember Valentine's Day), CUE THE SIGNIFICANT MUSIC stuff.....), but there are also grace moments here and there.  A tree appears out of nowhere.  Someone suddenly remembers a kiss and some vague part of a seemingly casual conversation in a backyard.  Things like that.  There is a lovely quality to the way the main characters slide in and out of meeting each other, and struggle to almost remember, like a word on the tip of the tongue.Contrary to some of the previous reviewers, the script is actually very tightly constructed for the most part (a rewatching reveals interesting touches that seem initially implausible -- how does he remember and then find the exact Valentine's Day reference in the final letter? but then we recall that it was just that letter that was the breakup letter she sent him, and she gives us part of the details in voice over). But there are leaks. It seems hardly likely that after she rediscovers Persuasion in its plastic wrap, given its symbolic importance, she would not think of at least tracking Alex down once more -- she knows his name and what he does.  The scene is just there as a device. I've spent a little time trying to work out the details of the time shifts, and there are one or two of them that I think don't quite hold together:  the trouble is keeping track of what changes -- we are never quite sure if and when the past is simultaneously being changed through the new intervention in time of their correspondence -- the classic problem.  I think they are nevertheless mostly well handled (the dog's role is nicely woven into this, though her role as helpful angel is a bit overdone).  It's not completely clear what year the final scene is in (I think 2008, but it could have been spelled out a bit more, we only learn the date from the brother's reference to the accidental death exactly two years previously).  A tiny bit more signposting would have helped: giving us the date of the dinner would have helped enormously -- one keeps thinking it must be one of the various Valentine's Days which it isn't.  (Two years tomorrow makes it early 2007, I think).  The return of the other boyfriend must be happening through 2007 and into early 2008.  And so on.  The big obvious technical flaw in the movie is that Kate doesn't remember the face of the dead man she worked so hard to save, in a situation which meant so much to her -- this is completely implausible.  It might work if she were some kind of unthinking mechanistic doctor and he was just another corpse, but, alas, she makes a big deal of what this dead man meant to her.  Makes no sense.The second best scene in the movie is the backyard scene, which is really well done -- beautifully paced throughout, a real actors' scene.  It's only drawback is the second-rate Paul McCartney song which, like so many of his second-rate songs, painfully reminds us of the first-rate songs he used to write.The best scene in the film is the second last scene in the architect's office when Sandra Bullock realizes what has happened -- the camera is right tight on her face, and she does a lovely piece of acting, you can watch her thinking through her eyes.""Il Mare"", the Korean original, is quite a lot like this version, except that it isn't as tightly constructed as this remake, and has some plot variations.  It's also a lot more ""art movie"". The lovers in the Korean version are more juvenile and they're more like students (and so they have a kind of innocent cuteness about them which is endearing -- their problem is not just love, they are still wandering around contemporary urban Korea and haven't yet figured out what they going to do with their lives; unlike Kate and Alex who are both already in careers).  There's also a Korean ""ghost story"" feel to the whole thing.  Unusually, I think the remake is a better film.",4,Translucent,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,4280,"['spoiler', 'references', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'go', 'movie', 'premise', 'do', ""n't"", 'What', 'like', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'autumnal', 'melancholy', 'quality', 'attic', 'old', 'letters', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'couple', 'clunky', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'could', 'do', 'recurring', 'use', 'Notorious', 'course', 'dull', 'man', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'remember', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'CUE', 'THE', 'SIGNIFICANT', 'MUSIC', 'stuff', '..', 'are', 'also', 'grace', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'tree', 'nowhere', 'Someone', 'suddenly', 'kiss', 'vague', 'part', 'seemingly', 'casual', 'conversation', 'backyard', 'Things', 'lovely', 'quality', 'way', 'main', 'characters', 'slide', 'meeting', 'other', 'struggle', 'almost', 'remember', 'word', 'tip', 'tongue.Contrary', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'script', 'actually', 'very', 'tightly', 'constructed', 'most', 'part', 'rewatching', 'reveals', 'interesting', 'touches', 'seem', 'initially', 'implausible', 'how', 'remember', 'then', 'find', 'exact', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'reference', 'final', 'letter', 'then', 'recall', 'was', 'just', 'letter', 'was', 'breakup', 'letter', 'sent', 'part', 'details', 'voice', 'are', 'leaks', 'hardly', 'likely', 'Persuasion', 'plastic', 'wrap', 'given', 'symbolic', 'importance', 'would', 'not', 'think', 'least', 'tracking', 'Alex', 'down', 'once', 'more', 'name', 'what', 'scene', 'just', 'there', 'device', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'little', 'time', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'details', 'time', 'shifts', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hold', 'together', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'track', 'what', 'changes', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'when', 'past', 'simultaneously', 'being', 'changed', 'new', 'intervention', 'time', 'correspondence', 'classic', 'problem', 'think', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'mostly', 'well', 'handled', 'dog', 'role', 'nicely', 'woven', 'role', 'helpful', 'angel', 'bit', 'overdone', 'not', 'completely', 'clear', 'what', 'year', 'final', 'scene', 'think', '2008', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spelled', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'only', 'learn', 'date', 'brother', 'reference', 'accidental', 'death', 'exactly', 'two', 'years', 'previously', 'tiny', 'bit', 'more', 'signposting', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'giving', 'date', 'dinner', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'enormously', 'one', 'thinking', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'various', 'Valentine', 'Days', ""n't"", 'Two', 'years', 'tomorrow', 'early', '2007', 'think', 'return', 'other', 'boyfriend', 'must', 'be', 'happening', '2007', 'early', '2008', 'so', 'big', 'obvious', 'technical', 'flaw', 'movie', 'Kate', ""n't"", 'remember', 'face', 'dead', 'man', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'save', 'situation', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'completely', 'implausible', 'might', 'work', 'were', 'kind', 'unthinking', 'mechanistic', 'doctor', 'was', 'just', 'corpse', 'alas', 'big', 'deal', 'what', 'dead', 'man', 'meant', 'Makes', 'sense.The', 'second', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'backyard', 'scene', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'beautifully', 'paced', 'real', 'actors', 'scene', 'only', 'drawback', 'second-rate', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'song', 'so', 'many', 'second-rate', 'songs', 'painfully', 'first-rate', 'songs', 'used', 'write.The', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'second', 'last', 'scene', 'architect', 'office', 'when', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'what', 'happened', 'camera', 'right', 'tight', 'face', 'lovely', 'piece', 'acting', 'can', 'watch', 'thinking', 'eyes', 'Il', 'Mare', 'Korean', 'original', 'quite', 'lot', 'version', ""n't"", 'as', 'tightly', 'constructed', 'remake', 'plot', 'variations', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'art', 'movie', 'lovers', 'Korean', 'version', 'are', 'more', 'juvenile', ""'re"", 'more', 'like', 'students', 'so', 'have', 'kind', 'innocent', 'cuteness', 'endearing', 'problem', 'not', 'just', 'love', 'are', 'still', 'wandering', 'contemporary', 'urban', 'Korea', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'lives', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'careers', 'also', 'Korean', 'ghost', 'story', 'feel', 'whole', 'thing', 'Unusually', 'think', 'remake', 'better', 'film']",N/A

1014249,A31BBNT8C62MLU,B000HEWEE4,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[1, 1]","This review contains no spoilers.  I'm a fan of romantic time-travel movies, and this is one of a handful, for me, that passes the repeat viewing litmus test (gets better, reveals more with each viewing).  It's intriguing from a time flux standpoint, in its character development, and in terms of the chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves.  This is one of Reeves's best and most sensitive performances, Bullock's too.  The fact that there is such chemistry between them when they're rarely on screen together is a tribute to the script and the film makers.Do you settle for someone who's just ""OK"" and available, or do you hold out for a soulmate, a love that transcends time and space?  Obviously, few of us will ever experience anything like this, it's fantasy, big-time suspension of disbelief required, but what a magic respite from ordinary reality!  And yet- some might say that one needn't undergo such temporal transformations to find love that was MEANT TO BE, that makes it ALL worthwhile.  The longing Reeves and Bullock have for each other resonates throughout the film, and in Rachel Portman's haunting soundtrack:The Lake House, which I downloaded and play often.  This is a quiet, understated film, providing plenty of time for the wonder and profundities of life and love to soak in.  Are events chaotic and happenstance, or do they happen for a reason?  Though that latter perspective is featured to great effect in this film, the issue is one that may resound in our ordinary lives as well.I don't want to ruin anyone's viewing experience, I'll simply say that an event occurs in the movie that forms the bond between them across time in the first place- it wasn't readily apparent to me at first, quite subtle, but the significance dawned on me later, gives me chills just thinking about it. To be honest, the parallel lives though separated in time STILL does not quite compute for me, can't quite grasp it for some reason, but no matter- not strictly necessary for appreciation of the themes- destiny, true love, synchronicity.  This is a favorite film, on several levels, about the meaning of work, the potency of family relationships, the power of desire...hope.  Quiet, evocative, it steadily builds to a thrilling, moving, deeply satisfying ending.

But of course, that's the point!  These two people, we certainly find out why, have a lot of issues with relationships and just being with people in general.  I know some people think Keanu Reeves is a very dry/flat actor but I think he did very well in this part.  He expressed passion, loneliness, frustration, compassion, etc. quite well!  Plus, I have to say, I love the song ""I Can't Seem to Make You Mine"" by the Clientele that opens the movie.Basically, this is a film about fate and waiting for the right time for things to happen.  I believe in that!  This movie, for all its time-traveling-letters thing really does a great job of showing how your know when something isn't right.  It illustrates patience in waiting for the right time for things to come along and gives us hope that if we stop trying to push and wait until the time comes when it feels right to do something, we will succeed!  Also, that you can't be fixed or helped unless you want to and you work actively to fix yourself!I really do recommend this movie.

1014253,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000HEWEE4,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","`The Lake House' is a Hollywood remake of Korean film `Il Mare' (The Sea') made in 2000. Though the filmmakers have changed many settings, the basic plot line remains the same, which is about a mystical exchange of letters between a man and a woman. The point is, the man, Alex (Keanu Reeves) lives in the year 2004 while the woman, Kate (Sandra Bullock), lives in 2006.This is a love story, and a very romantic one. The communication between Alex and Kate, which gradually develops into rapport, or something more, is carried out through a time-traveling mail-box standing before the curious glass house by the lake. Like `Somewhere in Time' or `Frequency' you need suspension of disbelief to enjoy the story, which looks less plausible in a modernized city of Chicago than in a seaside house in Korea.The script is skillfully written so as not to make us realize the implausibility of the film's situations, and though some (or many) would notice where the story is going at the earlier stage, the film all in all succeeds in keeping us guessing: `Can they meet each other?' The chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock is a genuine one even though we know their `conversation' is physically impossible and there is one romantic scene that is accompanied with an equally romantic Paul McCartney song. And the reference to one Jane Austen novel is clever and intelligent.`The Lake House' is a wildly romantic film and is impressive as such. Still, the sub-plot about the shaky relations between Alex and his father (Christopher Plummer) fails to interest us. Actually no supporting actors, even Shohreh Aghdashlook, are memorable, but you know this film is made for Keanu and Sandra. And I referred to the `implausible' plot, but implausibility didn't bother me. Still I'm afraid the idea of moving the location to Chicago is not a good one because the two-year lapse does not seem a big difficulty to overcome with this background.

1014254,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B000HEWEE4,Tucker Andersen,"[395, 421]","If you enjoy love stories, then you should delight as much in this modern day fairy tale as my wife and I did. Sandra Bullock (one of my favorite actresses) as Dr. Kate Forster and Keanu Reeves as Alex Wyler complement each other extremely well and manage to develop a tangible chemistry despite the unique nature of their ""long distance"" (in time) relationship. However, you have to be prepared to suspend your usual conception of the relationship of time and place and accept unconditionally the truly unusual and scientifically fictional aspects of the storyline. This film is about emotions, interpersonal relationships and personal discovery, and needs to be engaged with your heart, not your mind.CAUTION: it was obvious from the comments of other moviegoers who watched the film with us that our enthusiasm was not universally shared. Perhaps understandably given several of Sandra's Bullock's previous films, some people obviously expected to see a typical romantic comedy, which this most definitely is not despite some truly funny sequences. Others seemed to be unable to let go of their attempt to rationally analyze the techniques which the story utilized to further the relationship between Kate and Alex; this trait led to their inability simply to accept the facts as the writer and producer chose to present them in furtherance of the story and thus distracted from the essence of the film, which is the development of the central characters' relationship and the mystery of how the story will conclude. And finally, a few seemed bewildered that anyone would find such a ridiculous story appealing and frustrated that they had wasted almost two hours of their time watching it.As the film begins, Kate and her female dog Jack are ending their tenancy at an architecturally  unique LAKE HOUSE and moving into a modern new apartment in downtown Chicago near the hospital where she is on staff. She leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant, which Alex finds when he moves into the house. Thus, very early in the film, the four main actors in this drama have already been introduced - Kate, Alex, Jack, and THE LAKE HOUSE itself. However, the key plot twist of what briefly appears a rather conventional and undoubtedly otherwise pedestrian romance (which would simply be a showcase for the stars) is introduced. It is a concept familiar to science fiction fans but seldom used in other genres; specifically time shifting together with some aspects of parallel universes. Since what has happened is incidental to the story and never explained, it is not clear at any particular point in the story what rules will apply to the situations in which the characters find themselves. (N.B. This film should definitely not be included in the genre of science fiction, it involves neither time travel or futurism.)However, when Alex replies to Kate's note and a correspondence ensues,  their initial misunderstandings soon turn to disbelief when she claims to be living in 2006 and he is in 2004. What! How could she move out and he then move in?  Despite their incredulity, they eventually both become convinced that their lives really have been linked through some sort of time warp. Of course, since this is a love story they then both become increasingly attracted to each other  (Remember, you can't expect to understand how the intermediary device of the magic mailbox operates, just enjoy the flag waving which results.) The story is incredibly cleverly constructed, with several threads gradually coming together and increasingly causing their lives to become intertwined. THE LAKE HOUSE, a memorable edifice built on stilts and reached by a walkway over the water is reminiscent of Phillip Johnson's signature Glass House. It not only unites Alex and Kate but plays a crucial role in Alex's family history and his strained relationship with his father, the noted architect Simon Wyler (Christopher Plummer).The enjoyment of the film is in fact heightened by its leisurely pace, the cast (and the supporting roles are uniformly well acted) has time to develop the story and let us get to know Kate and Alex as they get to know each other; thus we also experience their frustration that thyey may have to accept the fact that they will be resigned to living separate lives. The most difficult aspect of the film for me to follow was the fact that the sequence of  the scenes as presented to the moviegoer was not always immediately clear. Not only are Alex and Kate simultaneously living in different years, but their individual experiences are not presented in chronological order. There are frequent flashbacks and the jumps forward to their individual present day selves, interspersed with one chance meeting of which only Alex is aware. Remember, concentrate on their story - not on trying to figure out how it is occurring. One incredibly deft touch is the use of a copy of Jane Austen's PERSUASION as both a very important point of contact in their relationship and also with the story as a metaphor for their situation.In conclusion, if you enjoy fantasy, then you should enjoy this unconventional love story. In addition, you also get as a bonus to try to figure out how an appealing dog such as Jack could somehow live with both Kate and Alex and maybe you will even receive a few insights about architecture. Just remember to pay attention to details, because at various times during the film events occur whose complete relevance only becomes clear much later. Interestingly enough, if you do pick up these clues, while they foreshadow some of the later events (in the sequence in which the movie unfolds), they in no way make the eventual outcome predictable and thus do not spoil the story.  Fun, interesting, well acted, emotionally satisfying and unpredictable enough to keep your interest - certainly a more attractive set of attributes than most of today's film fare.Tucker

What I will say is that I've watched this movie on DVD at least eight times since I bought it, and the story line and acting still hold up magnificently for me.  What shifts this film from being a good love story to a great love story is the ending.  I didn't see it coming, though friends of mine said that they did.  The first time that I saw the ending, it hit me with a powerful emotional punch that left me breathless and my eyes full of tears.  That made this movie a winner in my opinion.

I would highly recommned this film to any individual who enjoyed The Notebook, Message In a Bottle, The Horse Whisperer, and The Bridges of Madison County.

1014264,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,B000HEWEE4,Wendy C. Rigney,"[1, 1]","Okay, first let's get the obvious out of the way: Yes, the time travel aspect does tend to lead to confusion and, perhaps, the occasional plot hole or two. That said? My motto is simply, ""Go with it!"" Do not analyze, do not try to make the illogical, logical, and enjoy the journey of the characters and their romance.The characters referred to, as is known by now to many, are Dr. Kate Forster, played with a low-key grace by Sandra Bullock, and architect Alex Wyler, son of a more famous architect who still battles past demons thanks to said father. Keanu Reeves has been often called wooden, but I think he did an excellent job in this movie. I could sense Alex's antipathy towards his father and his loneliness and longing for Kate.You all know the story: Kate Forster begins the movie by leaving the lake house, an odd, yet visually stunning house, for a place in the heart of Chicago to be nearer to her work at the local hospital. On her way out, she leaves a letter for the next occupant to forward her mail should she receive any.Alex gets that letter, positive Kate is mistaken: No one has lived in the lake house for years. Come to find out, Alex lived at the lake house *before* Kate. Somehow, some wrinkle in time has allowed Kate and Alex to correspond through a mailbox. What starts as pleasant chatter and jokes soon deepens into love, as the characters share their hopes and frustrations with the other.A charming scene takes place when Alex ""takes"" Kate on a tour of Chicago and leaves her a message spray painted on a building. With Alex's profession, architecture seems to be a nice backdrop in the film as much as the time travel element is.Over time, Kate and Alex long for each other. Kate even tells him of something she had lost two years prior. It is then he gets his first glimpse of Kate in his time. He finds what she wanted, too. Kate also manages to help Alex in a time of despair by sending him a book from her time that puts his relationship with his father into perspective.The romance is jeopardized before it even really can begin, however, by an event early in the film. For those who have not seen the movie, I won't say what it is. But time proves it is no match for love when Kate tries to give fate a hand and prevent the inevitable.Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves once again prove their chemistry in ""Speed"" was no fluke. It is just as evident here. Perhaps even more so, as the context of the film's openly wistful and romantic nature augment the chemistry. Each brings out the best in the other. Also great is Christopher Plummer as Alex's emotionally unavailable father and renowned architect, Simon Wyler. Ebon Bachrach as Alex's brother, Henry, also played off of Reeves well, and their familial bond was believable. Dylan Walsh also appears as Kate's on-and-off boyfriend, Morgan.Another thing that makes the movie and helps set the wistful, languid mood is the music. Rachel Portman's score is simply magnificent. And the ""popular"" tracks are appropriate, as well. I adored Paul McCartney's ""This Never Happened Before"" and the song that opens the movie, the somber, but ethereal ""(Can't Seem To) Make You Mine"" by The Clientele. I highly suggest buying the soundtrack as well as the DVD and/or BluRay.In short, a lot has been mentioned about the movie's implausible premise, but to quote Roger Ebert in his review, ""Never mind that!"" I adore this movie. I loved the romance, the hope, and yes, even the loneliness. And the dog playing Jack added a cuddly touch, too. This is not the typical chick flick. Neither is it one of those rom-coms or romantic dramas that rely on a lot of hot sex scenes. While I do like some movies of that vein, this is refreshing in its simplicity. It's almost a ""throwback"" kind of film to the romance genre.Put the analyzing away for a couple of hours, watch the characters and their romance unfold, and enjoy this film at face value. It is truly a slow-paced, but entirely enjoyable and romantic fantasy escape.And there's nothing wrong with that!",5,A (literally!) timeless love story...,1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,4029,"['Okay', 'first', 'let', 'get', 'obvious', 'way', 'Yes', 'time', 'travel', 'aspect', 'tend', 'lead', 'confusion', 'perhaps', 'occasional', 'plot', 'hole', 'two', 'said', 'My', 'motto', 'simply', 'Go', 'not', 'analyze', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'make', 'illogical', 'logical', 'enjoy', 'journey', 'characters', 'romance.The', 'characters', 'referred', 'known', 'now', 'many', 'are', 'Dr.', 'Kate', 'Forster', 'played', 'low-key', 'grace', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'architect', 'Alex', 'Wyler', 'son', 'more', 'famous', 'architect', 'who', 'still', 'past', 'demons', 'thanks', 'said', 'father', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'been', 'often', 'called', 'wooden', 'think', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'movie', 'could', 'sense', 'Alex', 'antipathy', 'towards', 'father', 'loneliness', 'longing', 'Kate.You', 'know', 'story', 'Kate', 'Forster', 'movie', 'leaving', 'lake', 'house', 'odd', 'yet', 'visually', 'stunning', 'house', 'place', 'heart', 'Chicago', 'be', 'nearer', 'work', 'local', 'hospital', 'way', 'letter', 'next', 'occupant', 'forward', 'mail', 'should', 'receive', 'any.Alex', 'letter', 'positive', 'Kate', 'mistaken', 'one', 'lived', 'lake', 'house', 'years', 'Come', 'find', 'out', 'Alex', 'lived', 'lake', 'house', '*before*', 'Kate', 'Somehow', 'wrinkle', 'time', 'allowed', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'correspond', 'mailbox', 'What', 'pleasant', 'chatter', 'jokes', 'soon', 'love', 'characters', 'share', 'hopes', 'frustrations', 'other.A', 'charming', 'scene', 'place', 'when', 'Alex', 'Kate', 'tour', 'Chicago', 'message', 'spray', 'painted', 'building', 'Alex', 'profession', 'architecture', 'be', 'nice', 'backdrop', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'travel', 'element', 'is.Over', 'time', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'long', 'other', 'Kate', 'even', 'something', 'had', 'lost', 'two', 'years', 'prior', 'then', 'first', 'glimpse', 'Kate', 'time', 'what', 'wanted', 'too', 'Kate', 'also', 'help', 'Alex', 'time', 'despair', 'sending', 'book', 'time', 'relationship', 'father', 'perspective.The', 'romance', 'jeopardized', 'even', 'really', 'can', 'begin', 'however', 'event', 'early', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'time', 'match', 'love', 'when', 'Kate', 'give', 'fate', 'hand', 'prevent', 'inevitable.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'once', 'again', 'prove', 'chemistry', 'Speed', 'was', 'fluke', 'just', 'evident', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'context', 'film', 'openly', 'wistful', 'romantic', 'nature', 'augment', 'chemistry', 'out', 'best', 'other', 'Also', 'great', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Alex', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'father', 'renowned', 'architect', 'Simon', 'Wyler', 'Ebon', 'Bachrach', 'Alex', 'brother', 'Henry', 'also', 'played', 'Reeves', 'well', 'familial', 'bond', 'was', 'believable', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'also', 'Kate', 'on-and-off', 'boyfriend', 'Morgan.Another', 'thing', 'movie', 'set', 'wistful', 'languid', 'mood', 'music', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'score', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'popular', 'tracks', 'are', 'appropriate', 'as', 'well', 'adored', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Never', 'Happened', 'song', 'movie', 'somber', 'ethereal', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Seem', 'Make', 'Mine', 'Clientele', 'highly', 'suggest', 'buying', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'and/or', 'BluRay.In', 'short', 'lot', 'been', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'implausible', 'premise', 'quote', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'Never', 'mind', 'adore', 'movie', 'loved', 'romance', 'hope', 'yes', 'even', 'loneliness', 'dog', 'playing', 'Jack', 'added', 'cuddly', 'touch', 'too', 'not', 'typical', 'chick', 'flick', 'one', 'rom-coms', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'rely', 'lot', 'hot', 'sex', 'scenes', 'do', 'movies', 'vein', 'refreshing', 'simplicity', 'almost', 'throwback', 'kind', 'film', 'romance', 'genre.Put', 'analyzing', 'away', 'couple', 'hours', 'watch', 'characters', 'romance', 'unfold', 'enjoy', 'film', 'face', 'value', 'truly', 'slow-paced', 'entirely', 'enjoyable', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'escape.And', 'nothing', 'wrong']",N/A

Now I'm going nuts trying to figure out how the writers could ever rationalize the time paradox they created when they set up the scenario for this movie.  Hello?  If she saves the man whose death catapulted her into a bunch of major life changes, then she will never have the event that made her make the changes that led to her having a romance through time with the man who died!  Duh?  When she's listing her favorite things during one of the stereotypical scenes, she lists the smell of her dog's feet--how gross is that?  How many people come home at the end of a long, tiring day & relax by sniffing their dog's feet?  And finally, she treats her long-suffering boyfriend like a piece of crap.  He keeps coming around, treating her nicely, trying to get her involved in the relationship but she goes glomming off & making out with random people or sighing over a guy she's never actually met.
