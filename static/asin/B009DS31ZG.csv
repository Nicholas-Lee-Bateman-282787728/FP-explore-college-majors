1595521,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B009DS31ZG,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[0, 0]","As had been quite clearly flagged up at the end of the previous series, Series 9 included the first change of personnel amongst the four main characters since the show was launched in 2003, as Jack Halford retired from UCOS. However, he did appear in the first episode just to tidy up the circumstances of his departure.We had to wait until Episode 4 to meet Jack's replacement, DI Steven McAndrew played by Denis Lawson. He is a hard headed Glaswegian who has been drafted in to help the team. McAndrew is completely different from Jack Halford, and I think the script writers made absolutely the right decision here and it would have been a mistake to try to clone Jack which would have resulted in the inevitable and constant comparisons.Apparently James Bolam, who played Jack Halford, wanted to leave as he felt the show had become stale. I would beg to differ as the script writers have continued to come up with some very interesting and varied stories. For example one involves a murder which took place some 160 years ago - a real cold case! The team are as interested in the motives for wanting to solve it in after all this time, as the circumstances of the crime itself. Another is a contemporary case which is not a cold case at all and involves a body turning up in a morgue under a false name. To be fair though, the episodes were a bit more mixed than usual as far as quality went this time round and a couple were quite obscure.There is a reasonable sprinkling of the private lives of Brian Lane and Gerry Standing, including a particularly hilarious session where Brian has aspirations for his dog to be a star of stage and screen! However, we learn little of the background of the new recruit until the last episode.",5,It Seems New Tricks May Be 'Getting To The End Of The Day',1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1735,"['had', 'been', 'quite', 'clearly', 'flagged', 'up', 'end', 'previous', 'series', 'Series', '9', 'included', 'first', 'change', 'personnel', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'show', 'was', 'launched', '2003', 'Jack', 'Halford', 'retired', 'UCOS', 'However', 'did', 'appear', 'first', 'episode', 'just', 'tidy', 'up', 'circumstances', 'departure.We', 'had', 'wait', 'Episode', '4', 'meet', 'Jack', 'replacement', 'DI', 'Steven', 'McAndrew', 'played', 'Denis', 'Lawson', 'hard', 'headed', 'Glaswegian', 'who', 'been', 'drafted', 'help', 'team', 'McAndrew', 'completely', 'different', 'Jack', 'Halford', 'think', 'script', 'writers', 'made', 'absolutely', 'right', 'decision', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mistake', 'try', 'clone', 'Jack', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'inevitable', 'constant', 'comparisons.Apparently', 'James', 'Bolam', 'who', 'played', 'Jack', 'Halford', 'wanted', 'leave', 'felt', 'show', 'had', 'become', 'stale', 'would', 'beg', 'differ', 'script', 'writers', 'have', 'continued', 'come', 'up', 'very', 'interesting', 'varied', 'stories', 'example', 'one', 'murder', 'took', 'place', '160', 'years', 'ago', 'real', 'cold', 'case', 'team', 'are', 'interested', 'motives', 'wanting', 'solve', 'time', 'circumstances', 'crime', 'contemporary', 'case', 'not', 'cold', 'case', 'body', 'turning', 'up', 'morgue', 'false', 'name', 'be', 'fair', 'episodes', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'mixed', 'usual', 'as', 'far', 'quality', 'went', 'time', 'round', 'couple', 'were', 'quite', 'obscure.There', 'reasonable', 'sprinkling', 'private', 'lives', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'Gerry', 'Standing', 'including', 'particularly', 'hilarious', 'session', 'where', 'Brian', 'aspirations', 'dog', 'be', 'star', 'stage', 'screen', 'However', 'learn', 'little', 'background', 'new', 'recruit', 'last', 'episode']",New Tricks: Season 9

Gerry is a lightening rod for women, despite now being a senior, and he has numerous ex wives, children and grandchildren, all still on the scene to bedevil his life.  Brian is obsessive in every facet of life.  this can lead to psychiatric and alcoholic problems but they mainly remain under control.  This obsessive quality is very handy for solving their cases. his long suffering wife Hester is a treasure.the show is at its very best when these two characters are fully utilized in all their facets as developed in previous seasons.  this was the only weakness in season nine.  they were under utilized, particularly in episodes involving British Intelligence getting in on their act.",4,i am still enjoying it but miss personal touches,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,1373,"['i', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'mind', 'losing', 'jack', 'halford', 'new', 'character', 'jack', 'was', 'always', 'weakest', 'three', 'men', 'character', 'what', 'i', 'have', 'missed', 'warm', 'human', 'touches', 'regarding', 'Brian', 'Gerry', 'personal', 'lives', 'are', 'very', 'rich', 'characters', 'home', 'lives', 'mirrored', 'families', 'were', 'vital', 'part', 'characters', 'been', 'pared', 'down', 'amanda', 'personal', 'life', 'contrast', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'paring', 'down.this', 'always', 'been', 'deft', 'blend', 'comedy', 'crime', 'three', 'seniors', 'woman', 'cop', 'demoted', 'handling', 'three', 'seniors', 'are', 'retired', 'cops', 'who', 'now', 'work', 'cold', 'cases', 'two', 'funniest', 'characters', 'are', 'Gerry', 'Brian', 'Gerry', 'lightening', 'rod', 'women', 'now', 'being', 'senior', 'numerous', 'ex', 'wives', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'still', 'scene', 'bedevil', 'life', 'Brian', 'obsessive', 'facet', 'life', 'can', 'lead', 'psychiatric', 'alcoholic', 'problems', 'mainly', 'remain', 'control', 'obsessive', 'quality', 'very', 'handy', 'solving', 'cases', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'Hester', 'treasure.the', 'show', 'very', 'best', 'when', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'utilized', 'facets', 'developed', 'previous', 'seasons', 'was', 'only', 'weakness', 'season', 'nine', 'were', 'utilized', 'particularly', 'episodes', 'involving', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'getting', 'act']",New Tricks: Season 9

1595528,A108D2GI4W2KY2,B009DS31ZG,"D. Klecan ""kleeks""","[44, 50]","Several people including the actors have stated that the show has become stale.  That is the reason James Bolam (Jack) stated for why he left this season. It is also the reason, posted throughout the internet, that Redman and others will be leaving after season 10.The problem is not staleness (doing the same thing) but rather they got rid of any and everything that made this show fun.  Gone are Jerry's wifes and kids, gone is Brian's dog and Esther barely makes an appearance every couple of shows.  The show has the feel of a job (we've all been there) that has had a change of management and ever body now has to tow the company line.... no more fun, nor more excitement...let's get rid of all and any employee morale. Lawson's McAndrew replaced Jack in episode 4 (and except for a brief dinner with Esther) had little or no fanfare.  Here was an opportunity for several episodes of him interacting with the team in various funny situations.  Can you imagine McAndrew with Gerry's wifes...it would have been hilarious. But nothing happened.Even the office has changed for the worse.  At some point the open area surrounded by the three desks with Pullman's office to the side has been replaced with a cramped area filled with Hawaii 5.0 styled glass-illuminated tables and fancy side walls with data.  The old-style stand-alone boards are gone.  Remember the pilot with photographs falling from the board.  Isn't this the premise of the show, ex-cops solving cold cases with their experience, using left-over equipment and nothing fancy.The shows kept getting worse and worse.  Don't get me wrong, if you like British procedural crime show, then keep watching, but if you want to watch a fun, charming show with quirky characters...this season is not it.  The episode, Dead Poet, was the perfect example.  The team gets the case, they interview several super-snooty British characters and solve the case.  The scene with Brian reading poetry to Esther lasted less than a minute and was not funny, charming, or illuminating.  In fact, the next day when Brian told his peers about his romantic evening with Esther it seemed to fall on deaf ears...no jokes, no fun.The episode, A Part of a Whole, is basically Strickland and his boss, the obnoxious Fisher (from A Death in the Family) and their little MI-5 undercover group. Super boring!!!!  Strickland's role is solely to give the UCOS team their assignments and keep them in line.  Unless the UCOS team is making fun of Strickland, he is not funny or interesting enough to carry an entire episode.New Tricks fans are fanatic and will continue to give the show 5 stars regardless. I am a super fan as well, but I can't honestly give this show 5 stars.  I remember watching Magnum P.I....never missed an episode.  However, the last season was all about his past as a Navy Seal in Vietnam.  The show became serious and dramatic. I didn't care how cute Magnum was, I completely lost interest.  That's how I feel about New Tricks, season 9.",3,Show not stale....it has been stripped!!!,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,2991,"['Several', 'people', 'including', 'actors', 'have', 'stated', 'show', 'become', 'stale', 'reason', 'James', 'Bolam', 'Jack', 'stated', 'why', 'left', 'season', 'also', 'reason', 'posted', 'internet', 'Redman', 'others', 'will', 'be', 'leaving', 'season', '10.The', 'problem', 'not', 'staleness', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'rather', 'got', 'rid', 'everything', 'made', 'show', 'fun', 'Gone', 'are', 'Jerry', 'wifes', 'kids', 'gone', 'Brian', 'dog', 'Esther', 'barely', 'appearance', 'couple', 'shows', 'show', 'feel', 'job', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'change', 'management', 'ever', 'body', 'now', 'tow', 'company', 'line', 'more', 'fun', 'more', 'excitement', 'let', 'get', 'rid', 'employee', 'morale', 'Lawson', 'McAndrew', 'replaced', 'Jack', 'episode', '4', 'brief', 'dinner', 'Esther', 'had', 'little', 'fanfare', 'Here', 'was', 'opportunity', 'several', 'episodes', 'interacting', 'team', 'various', 'funny', 'situations', 'Can', 'imagine', 'McAndrew', 'Gerry', 'wifes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'nothing', 'happened.Even', 'office', 'changed', 'worse', 'point', 'open', 'area', 'surrounded', 'three', 'desks', 'Pullman', 'office', 'side', 'been', 'replaced', 'cramped', 'area', 'filled', 'Hawaii', '5.0', 'styled', 'glass-illuminated', 'tables', 'fancy', 'side', 'walls', 'data', 'old-style', 'stand-alone', 'boards', 'are', 'gone', 'Remember', 'pilot', 'photographs', 'falling', 'board', ""n't"", 'premise', 'show', 'ex-cops', 'solving', 'cold', 'cases', 'experience', 'using', 'left-over', 'equipment', 'nothing', 'fancy.The', 'shows', 'kept', 'getting', 'worse', 'worse', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'British', 'procedural', 'crime', 'show', 'then', 'keep', 'watching', 'want', 'watch', 'fun', 'charming', 'show', 'quirky', 'characters', 'season', 'not', 'episode', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'was', 'perfect', 'example', 'team', 'case', 'interview', 'several', 'super-snooty', 'British', 'characters', 'solve', 'case', 'scene', 'Brian', 'reading', 'poetry', 'Esther', 'lasted', 'less', 'minute', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'charming', 'illuminating', 'fact', 'next', 'day', 'when', 'Brian', 'told', 'peers', 'romantic', 'evening', 'Esther', 'seemed', 'fall', 'deaf', 'ears', 'jokes', 'fun.The', 'episode', 'A', 'Part', 'Whole', 'basically', 'Strickland', 'boss', 'obnoxious', 'Fisher', 'A', 'Death', 'Family', 'little', 'MI-5', 'undercover', 'group', 'Super', 'boring', 'Strickland', 'role', 'solely', 'give', 'UCOS', 'team', 'assignments', 'keep', 'line', 'UCOS', 'team', 'making', 'fun', 'Strickland', 'not', 'funny', 'interesting', 'enough', 'carry', 'entire', 'episode.New', 'Tricks', 'fans', 'are', 'fanatic', 'will', 'continue', 'give', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'regardless', 'am', 'super', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'give', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'remember', 'watching', 'Magnum', 'P.I', '.never', 'missed', 'episode', 'However', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'past', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'Vietnam', 'show', 'became', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'cute', 'Magnum', 'was', 'completely', 'lost', 'interest', 'how', 'feel', 'New', 'Tricks', 'season', '9']",New Tricks: Season 9

1595535,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B009DS31ZG,G. Teslovich,"[1, 2]","Scripts with each successive season get less and less plausible; less complex; more soap opera formula like. There is less intelligent investigative work by the team with the shows' script writers just picking what's currently newsworthy as the focal plots or even worse a plot that is too bizarre to be real (e.g. the first episode of a 150 year old case). Getting poorer still are the usual quick endings with abrupt confessions by the guilty from just a few, less than incisive, questions (this season there seems to always be a lawyer, who is always unnaturally silent, sitting next to the confessor). Even a grade schooler could handle this level of questioning when caught cheating by a teacher. The coup de grce is the acting that is bland, non-committal, and without the early season's wit.

1595536,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B009DS31ZG,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[2, 3]","As strong a cop/humor show as ever. Since 2003, this fast-pace old-guy investigation team is led by buxom blonde DS Pullman (Amanda Redman- `Little Dorrit'). They are handed cases from the past, unsolvable, but now new evidence suggests this Unsolved Crimes & Open Case team can get the job done right. Not without few mess-ups along the way, plus plenty of humor mingled with suspense. The episodes are now filled with many guest stars; a few are noted in the episode synopsis below. No end in sight for this great BBC small screen hit. Season 9 saw one regular team member leave, but is soon replaced. You may like the replacement even better.Regular cast supporting Redman:Alun Armstrong ... Brian LaneJames Bolam ... Jack Halford who leaves after the first episodeSteve McAndrew ... Denis LawsonDennis Waterman ... Gerry StandingSusan Jameson ... Esther Lane, Brian's wifeAnthony Calf ... D.A.C. Robert StricklandSDH SUBTITLES  for all 10 episodes, each about an hour.Episode 1--A Death in the Family ---Jack decides to quit as they investigate an 1851 murder. Even Strickland asks why agent Fisher's (Tim McInnerny- `Notting Hill') pushing this ancient case.  McInnerny guest stars in the final episode as well.2--Old School Ties ---A teacher disappeared but now there's a body. Plenty of staff strife and school finances to cause suspicion. Archie the Latin teacher (Brian Pettifer- `Doc Martin) & Eliz Clayton (Susannah Harker- `Young James Herriot').A dialogue quote for this episode: ""Whether you like it or not, Jack has gone.""3--Queen and Country ---Suicide or murder? Cover-up? A multi-crime solving involving a set of twins (Sharon Small) and Hammond by James Wilby (Island at War).4--The Girl Who Lived ---Teenage Scot missing girl's DNA found at a London robbery. Retired Glasgow detective Steve McAndrew assists the now shorted handed UCOS team. Ken Wright played by Sean McGinley (bleak House; Braveheart).5--Body of Evidence ---Computer geek ex-cop Longthorn uncovered at a teaching hospital. A cadaver surprise. UCOS computer man, Brian, has issues with the new team player, McAndrew, a Scot with brogue. See Prof. Blake get played by Alex Jennings (Cranford).6--Love Means Nothing in Tennis ---Did tennis champion jump to her death? Plenty of suspects suggest she was pushed. Sports mom Victoria (Tamzin Outhwaite) and dad David (Brendon Doyle- `Downton Abbey') are just 2 of the guest stars..7--Dead Poets ---Charred poet Doherty case reopened. Brian takes a poetical lead in this investigation. Sarah (Simone Lahbib- `Downton Abbey'; `Monarch of the Glen'), a tutor and lover, is suspect. Mara is played by Bronagh Gallagher (Sherlock Holmes).8--Blue Flower ---While bleeding to his death, an East German (Edward Baker-Duly- `Downton Abbey') stated 'Blue Flower'. Grace (Elizabeth Berrington- `Crimson Petals and the White') seems involved somehow. DCI Rosser played by Nicholas Burns. A history with secret police may hold the clues needed. Arguably, it is the best episode of 9th season.9--Glasgow UCOS ---A new UCOS established I Glasgow causes Gerry & Steve being sent up north to strengthen the start-up. A haggis nightmare for Gerry. 1st case forces Steve to face an old Scot adversary. Guests: DCI MacDougal (Kate Dickie), Helen Wray (Sandy McDade- `Larkrise to Candleford'); Mr. Ogilvy (Ralph Riach- `Young James Herriot'; `Monarch of the Glen').10--Part of a Whole ---A bomb attempt on Fisher.

1595538,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B009DS31ZG,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","The big news with Season Nine of the perennial favourite NEW TRICKS is that the show is in transition. Beyond the well-publicized and immediate departure of James Bolam in the first episode of this series, it becomes clear as Season Nine progresses that the stage is being set for a virtually new show with Dennis Waterman and Denis Lawson (Bolam&#8217;s replacement) at the centre. This is because Season Ten will see the departure of Alun Armstrong (after episode four) and Amanda Redman (after episode eight). That&#8217;s a 75% overhaul but because it is being done gradually, and because the plots are perhaps stronger than they&#8217;ve been in a while, NEW TRICKS just might pull it off.There is a very different, more serious tone to some of the episodes here, with the Dennis Waterman-sung, upbeat theme song not used at the end of a handful of the shows. Some very contemporary storylines are thrown into the mix, including such elements as computer hacking. At the heart of the show, however, remains the emphasis on relationships and even though NEW TRICKS is in a state of flux, the viewer doesn&#8217;t feel let down. We&#8217;re in the hands of people who understand and respect the long-cultivated relationships fans have with the characters. If the introduction of Denis Lawson&#8217;s character into the mix is any indication, there may just be new life in NEW TRICKS.The chemistry between Lawson and Waterman is wonderful and a good part of that is the fact Lawson&#8217;s Steve McAndrew is light years away from James Bolam&#8217;s irascible Jack Halford. McAndrew is thoughtful, generous, kind and fun. Instantly likeable, he fits into the show with ease and is entirely believable winning over his colleagues.One episode features Waterman and Lawson on special assignment in Scotland, with neither Alun Armstrong nor Amanda Redman in sight. The episode deals with the abuse of children in care homes and really touched a nerve in the UK when its production coincided with a very public sex scandal involving a children&#8217;s entertainer. Recently deceased at the time, Jimmy Savile was known for his charity work and flamboyant public persona. He was a much-loved, high-profile celebrity and the general public in the U.K. felt terribly betrayed when his decades-long abuse of children was revealed. Small wonder the episode was shown at a later date.The changes of Season Nine are major but not life-threatening. Here&#8217;s hoping they pave the way for the further, more intense transformation of NEW TRICKS that is to come. I have to say, I can&#8217;t imagine the show without Amanda Redman front and centre.

Their skill in solving these crimes prove intellect, ingeniousness, and grit, heightened by experience are treasures which need not diminish with years. Given that the cast represents mature people, it should have been expected that there would be changes-just as there would be in real life among older individuals. The cases are just as absorbing and the new characters/cast members, just as intriguing as those who came before.Special mention must be made of the fact that now that the cast is changing, the writers are making more of the previously underestimated Anthony Calf as DAC Strickland, and a truly terrific actor named Tim McInnerny as Stephen Fisher, villainous high level intelligence operative. He is such a talented villain that I was amazed to find he had starred in the comedy, Blackadder. I hope these two actors are being given increasingly large parts as the series progresses. They are greatly helping to sustain interest as the production goes through its current permutations.Its natural that viewers would be attached to the players and the group dynamics to which they have become accustomed.

The season runs the gamut of cases from the traditional murder to cold cases that are over a hundred years old, but each one leaves you guessing. I enjoyed how they give you a little insight in the private lives of the characters, whether its meeting their show biz pooch to the hint of something sinister with the new guy.

(Now, if by chance, you haven't seen the earlier ones, go back to  Season One and start there - do not pass Go &lt;g>- as it's best that way.  Now on to Season 9 ......I don't like ""spoilers"" especially with mysteries and so, when I get each new season I just put the discs in and watch, with reading the package. Of course, there was something odd when I looked at front of this one - there was a new face and ""Jack was missing"". So that was a ""spoiler"" already but I didn't know how he'd leave. (Let me say up front that I didn't search the web for answers. I wanted surprise.) I won't tell you how he leaves but I do like the new guy (Denis Lawson - who works well with Dennis Waterman from the original team). In fact - it's not really a spoiler - but one episode centers on the two Dennis's and - oddly - they don't even list Amanda and Alun in the opening titles!The other thing I noticed right off is that Amanda Redman - as Sandra - seems to be wearing looser clothes and her face is fuller and the camera angles such that you often see her from the back.  I wondered if she was pregnant during the filming this season. I haven't researched this either - I just went with the flow. Just an observation.There are already other reviews here which are much more detailed - especially the one by Harold ""Doc"" Wolf - that details each episode. I don't read those until after I've seen the Season as - again - the real fun is in discovering things - not reading spoilers.  I will say that the stories have a variety to them this time, missing in last few seasons. Lots of police corruption and international intrigue plus ""local"" murders. (These are not ""spoilers"".)The Special Features are two short (5 and 6 minute) featurettes. One about the new character and the other about shooting scene in Episode 10. Both feature interviews with  the two Dennis/Denis actors and comments from the actor who plays the UCOS boss Strickland. Nice addition but not essential.I know there is a Season 10 now - and I read in one review that there are more cast changes (but I don't want to know who is leaving).
