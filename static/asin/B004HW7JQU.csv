But the episode ""Pulling Strings"" had a scene that was so incredibly ignorant and stupid, that I have to comment.

In this boneheaded scene the ""Philharmonic"" is a string quartet with no conductor in a hall the size of a teacup. All they had to do to get it right was make it a chamber orchestra (say 16-18 players) and pay a few amateur musicians as extras, letting them mime playing up on stage.

1410183,A3A9UCRADPMCT8,B004HW7JQU,James Horlan,"[0, 0]","Season Three of White Collar is an interesting spin on the series.  There are two main plot arcs, each taking up half a season, and both ratchet up the tension really well.Arc one completes the storylines of Season Two, the U-Boat treasure being the main one.  Neal (Matt Bomer) and Mozzie (Willie Garson) are contemplating hightailing it out of the country and into freedom, while Peter (Tim DeKay) and his demi-Suits (Marsha Thomsen and Sharif Atkins), as Mozz calls them, focus on their belief that Neal and Mozz have the treasure, but have no proof or probable cause.  Complications ensue, involving Sara (Hilarie Burton) and Keller (Ross McCall), and a lot of danger to Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen).  As said, tons of tension is involved, as well as ""is the grass greener"" from Neal and Mozz, with Neal wondering about the life he'd leave behind, while a loyal Mozz, reluctant to leave his best friend behind, nevertheless is getting increasingly antsy.The second arc is about a possible commutation of Neal's sentence, freeing him from the final two years of his anklet and allowing him to live free of monitoring.  There are characters, both in and outside of the main narrative, who favor different sides in this debate, while you can almost see Neal drooling at times.  Particularly so is when he gets to work with the world's master thief, the rich man's Robin Hood (motto:  No one goes to jail, everyone gets paid).  His yearning for his old life is palpable in that episode, and sets the tone for the remainder of the season.  The big theme of this arc is:  Is Neal really reformed, or is he just biding his time?Matthew Bomer is excellent as ever, it's a mystery to me why he's not a bigger deal than he is.  He's such a good actor that I hope that this is his ER, with him as a possible successor to Clooney (who broke out at roughly the same age that Bomer is now).  Tim DeKay is much improved over the first two seasons, where I was wondering if perhaps he was playing the part a bit too goofy.  Goofy is for Willie Garson, who has a lot of scenes with Tiffani Thiessen, and they prove to be a great low key comic duo.  Marsha Thomsen and Sharif Atkins have more to do than in previous seasons, and pull it off, while Hilarie Burton portrays Sara as someone fully aware of how potentially dangerous Neal is, and skittish as a result.  Which is how it would be.  Most cable shows have a hard time filling acting slots 3-8 with talented actors, but White Collar has no such issues.The end of the season seems to shift the show in a different direction, which should be good if they want to keep it running.

1410196,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004HW7JQU,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","It seems amazing to me that so much great television is happening right now. For so long there was nothing to watch on TV. I found myself watching little more than reruns because the then current crop of shows were terrible. And then a few years ago something happened. New shows were interesting and had characters that I cared about. Show stopped revolving around the central character and an entire cast was now central to a show's success. What was even more amazing was that these shows didn't begin on network TV but on cable stations, causing networks to up their game. But cable has continued to lead the way with shows like this one.To catch up the series is about a spectacular con man by the name of Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer). Neal was in prison when the show began, captured by the ever diligent FBI agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay). When Burke needed help on a particular case he was able to get Neal a release as long as he wore an ankle bracelet. This led to a partnership with Neal helping out the FBI's white collar task force in New York. It also led to several mishaps with Neal almost skirting the law and at the end of season 2 doing so completely. It was then that he and his cohort Mozzie (Willie Garson) were able to pilfer the contents of a missing sub that was filled with all sorts of art and riches.As this season opens the loot has been set aside and Neal and Mozzie continue to decide just what to do. At the same time Peter has a clue that the treasure didn't disappear in an explosion but was taken away prior to the fire. He suspects Neal but has no clues which digs at him since he and Neal have developed a rapport with one another. Peter sees the good in Neal, he just needs Neal to see the same.This season is filled with numerous characters and references to the past of several main ones. A gangster from Mozzie's past shows up in one episode. A classmate of Jones (another FBI agent) goes missing. Keller, the man who put the lives of many in this group in jeopardy, returns to seek down the missing treasure. And by the end of the season, Agent Kramer (Beau Bridges), Peter's mentor from long ago, steps in and tries to take Caffrey for his own use with plans to toss him aside when he finishes with him.The intriguing part about this series is the suave and sophisticated manner that Caffrey demonstrates while Peter always comes off as a working stiff determined to catch the bad guy. Peter also is the nice guy who wants to help Neal go straight. The two characters, adversaries at the start, have developed an admiration for one another as the show has progressed. You find yourself wanting them to be best friends but at the same time know that until Neal is released and changes his life around that won't happen. These are characters that you root for.As with BURN NOTICE, this series is well crafter. The acting is top notch, the look of the show makes you want to actually visit New York and the stories are compelling enough to hold your interest from start to finish. Combine those stories with the thread that runs all season concerning Neal and Mozzie and the missing treasure and you have a hit show. This one is not just worth watching but worth owning as well.",4,ANOTHER GREAT SERIES,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,3214,"['amazing', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'television', 'happening', 'right', 'now', 'so', 'long', 'was', 'nothing', 'watch', 'TV', 'found', 'watching', 'little', 'more', 'reruns', 'then', 'current', 'crop', 'shows', 'were', 'terrible', 'then', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'something', 'happened', 'New', 'shows', 'were', 'interesting', 'had', 'characters', 'cared', 'about', 'Show', 'stopped', 'revolving', 'central', 'character', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'now', 'central', 'show', 'success', 'What', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'was', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'begin', 'network', 'TV', 'cable', 'stations', 'causing', 'networks', 'up', 'game', 'cable', 'continued', 'lead', 'way', 'shows', 'one.To', 'catch', 'series', 'spectacular', 'con', 'man', 'name', 'Neal', 'Caffrey', 'Matt', 'Bomer', 'Neal', 'was', 'prison', 'when', 'show', 'began', 'captured', 'ever', 'diligent', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Peter', 'Burke', 'Tim', 'DeKay', 'When', 'Burke', 'needed', 'help', 'particular', 'case', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'Neal', 'release', 'as', 'long', 'wore', 'ankle', 'bracelet', 'led', 'partnership', 'Neal', 'helping', 'out', 'FBI', 'white', 'collar', 'task', 'force', 'New', 'York', 'also', 'led', 'several', 'mishaps', 'Neal', 'almost', 'skirting', 'law', 'end', 'season', '2', 'doing', 'so', 'completely', 'was', 'then', 'cohort', 'Mozzie', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'were', 'able', 'pilfer', 'contents', 'missing', 'sub', 'was', 'filled', 'sorts', 'art', 'riches.As', 'season', 'loot', 'been', 'set', 'aside', 'Neal', 'Mozzie', 'continue', 'decide', 'just', 'what', 'do', 'same', 'time', 'Peter', 'clue', 'treasure', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappear', 'explosion', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'prior', 'fire', 'Neal', 'clues', 'digs', 'Neal', 'have', 'developed', 'rapport', 'one', 'Peter', 'good', 'Neal', 'just', 'Neal', 'see', 'same.This', 'season', 'filled', 'numerous', 'characters', 'references', 'past', 'several', 'main', 'ones', 'gangster', 'Mozzie', 'past', 'up', 'one', 'episode', 'classmate', 'Jones', 'FBI', 'agent', 'missing', 'Keller', 'man', 'who', 'put', 'lives', 'many', 'group', 'jeopardy', 'seek', 'down', 'missing', 'treasure', 'end', 'season', 'Agent', 'Kramer', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Peter', 'mentor', 'long', 'ago', 'steps', 'tries', 'take', 'Caffrey', 'own', 'use', 'plans', 'toss', 'aside', 'when', 'him.The', 'intriguing', 'part', 'series', 'suave', 'sophisticated', 'manner', 'Caffrey', 'Peter', 'always', 'off', 'working', 'stiff', 'determined', 'catch', 'bad', 'guy', 'Peter', 'also', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'help', 'Neal', 'go', 'straight', 'two', 'characters', 'adversaries', 'start', 'have', 'developed', 'admiration', 'one', 'show', 'progressed', 'find', 'wanting', 'be', 'best', 'friends', 'same', 'time', 'know', 'Neal', 'released', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'are', 'characters', 'root', 'for.As', 'BURN', 'NOTICE', 'series', 'well', 'crafter', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'look', 'show', 'want', 'actually', 'visit', 'New', 'York', 'stories', 'are', 'compelling', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'start', 'finish', 'Combine', 'stories', 'thread', 'season', 'concerning', 'Neal', 'Mozzie', 'missing', 'treasure', 'have', 'hit', 'show', 'one', 'not', 'just', 'worth', 'watching', 'worth', 'owning', 'as', 'well']",N/A
