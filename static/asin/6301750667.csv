The ten Disney songs featured in this video are: 'The Little Mermaid', 'Peter Pan', '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea', 'The Rescuers', and more. This video is fun and educational for kids or any one who is studying spanish. I now know some of the songs by heart in spanish with the help of this video. Now me and my Mexican friend can sing together. This will keep kids occupied for days while teaching them! Also you can check out other 'Canta Con Nosotros' videos featuring other popular Disney films.",4,"fun, fun, fun!",987897600,"04 22, 2001",2001,749,"['recently', 'purchased', 'video', 'thinking', 'songs', 'were', 'Disney', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'Little', 'Mermaid', ""'Besala"", 'Girl', 'el', 'Mar', 'th', 'Sea', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'cover', 'ten', 'Disney', 'songs', 'featured', 'video', 'are', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Pan', ""'20,000"", 'Leagues', 'Sea', ""'The"", 'Rescuers', 'more', 'video', 'fun', 'educational', 'kids', 'one', 'who', 'studying', 'spanish', 'now', 'know', 'songs', 'heart', 'spanish', 'help', 'video', 'Now', 'Mexican', 'friend', 'can', 'sing', 'together', 'will', 'keep', 'kids', 'occupied', 'days', 'teaching', 'Also', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'other', ""'Canta"", 'Con', 'Nosotros', 'videos', 'featuring', 'other', 'popular', 'Disney', 'films']",Disney Sing Along Songs: Under the Sea VHS
263903,A3TD7B0CT1NHO4,6301750667,Gregory Nyman,"[13, 13]","Unlike some other reviewers who found that this Sing Along video was deceptive, or included old fashioned songs which kids couldn't relate to, I'd disagree whole-heartedly.  The fact is, the title refers to a thematic idea - under the sea, with all the kinds of songs and images which might be included in that concept.  So, while the theme song ""Under the Sea"" was great, as was ""Kiss the Girl,"" so were the songs ""By the Beautiful Sea,"" and ""At the Codfish Ball,"" as well as the other songs, some from ""Peter Pan,"" and ""The Rescuers.""  It's a great diversity of music, and not just inclusive of ""The Little Mermaid.""  If you want the music from the movie, just buy the movie.  All the music is in it.This is a great collection, and a classic for the whole family.

This Sing Along Songs video is not my favorite, but it's pretty close.It's just so much fun.

263905,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6301750667,magellan,"[1, 1]","I bought this tape to get the main song and arrangement from The Little Mermaid. I like Jamaican steel drum music, and this is one of the best songs done in this style that I've seen. If you add in the visuals, you get one of Disney's finest moments, in my humble opinion. The whole video has a sea or maritime theme, though, which is nice because it thematically ties everything together, and the songs range from 1930s to the 1980s, including Disney's reprisals of even older songs (such as ""By the Beautiful Sea,"" which I suspect goes back to the 1890s or early 1900s). Overall a good video and Scrooge McDuck serves as the host. :-)",5,A brief comment,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,636,"['bought', 'tape', 'get', 'main', 'song', 'arrangement', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'like', 'Jamaican', 'steel', 'drum', 'music', 'one', 'best', 'songs', 'done', 'style', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'add', 'visuals', 'get', 'one', 'Disney', 'finest', 'moments', 'humble', 'opinion', 'whole', 'video', 'sea', 'maritime', 'theme', 'nice', 'thematically', 'everything', 'together', 'songs', 'range', '1930s', '1980s', 'including', 'Disney', 'reprisals', 'even', 'older', 'songs', 'such', 'Beautiful', 'Sea', 'suspect', 'back', '1890s', 'early', '1900s', 'Overall', 'good', 'video', 'Scrooge', 'McDuck', 'host']",Disney Sing Along Songs: Under the Sea VHS
