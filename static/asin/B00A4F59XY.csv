Life in the wilderness and respect for nature and animals are strong points for showing this to children. For adults however this series is seriously dated and too slow paced andjust not enough exciting content or dialog to keep most of us awake. No harmful content at all, very mild throughout, little ones will love the cute animals often depicted, although in a somewhat repetitive manner, with many shots either reused or similar cropping up constantly. If the slow pace doesn't bother you and the lack of detail..meaning there are many survival techniques used in the show that are not properly demonstrated or explained, only occasionally, if the storyline demanded it. A more involved script would have helped, maybe a remake someday..that would be a hit I think.
