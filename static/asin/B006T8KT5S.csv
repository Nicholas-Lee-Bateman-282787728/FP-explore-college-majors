Fans will not be disappointed as this DVD is chock full of their favorites. You know, songs like Rock Lobster, Funplex, Private Idaho and Love Shack - I mean, what would a B-52s show be without Love Shack?  It just ain't gonna happen!Recorded in hi-def with DTS Surround, Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, the energy, excitement and fun of the show is delivered and felt.  The production is so ""real"" that you almost find yourself compelled to brush wig hair that crowd members are wearing out of your face and bumping shoulders with them as you bop to the memory-raising tunes.  The call-and-response vocals that you would come to expect are all right there and as fun as ever.  Keith Strickland's guitar work is as great as ever.Wanna enjoy this concert on your iPod, car or elsewhere?  Then you're in luck!  This DVD was actually preceded by the CD of this very same show.  Doesn't that make you pogo-stick happy?  What you won't get with the CD are the great interviews that are included with the DVD.The biggest response that this DVD will create is the desire of B-52s fans all over the country to attend and be a part of the very special 35th Anniversary Tour that the band will undertake this summer.  Certain fortunate towns will even get to enjoy shows that will be shared with the band's friends, Squeeze.The B-52s with the Wild Crowd is available in both DVD and Blu-ray formats.Boomerocity.com",5,Great Fun With The B-52s,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,1695,"['B-52s', 'fans', 'slip', 'Vans', 'prepare', 'relive', 'fun', 'had', 'late', '70', '80', 'watch', 'B-52s', 'Wild', 'Crowd.Filmed', 'Valentine', 'Day', '2011', 'hometown', 'Athens', 'Georgia', 'show', 'commemorated', 'first', 'live', 'performance', 'exactly', '34', 'years', 'prior', 'Fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'chock', 'full', 'favorites', 'know', 'songs', 'Rock', 'Lobster', 'Funplex', 'Private', 'Idaho', 'Love', 'Shack', 'mean', 'what', 'would', 'B-52s', 'show', 'be', 'Love', 'Shack', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'happen', 'Recorded', 'hi-def', 'DTS', 'Surround', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'sound', 'energy', 'excitement', 'fun', 'show', 'delivered', 'felt', 'production', 'so', 'real', 'almost', 'find', 'compelled', 'brush', 'wig', 'hair', 'crowd', 'members', 'are', 'wearing', 'face', 'bumping', 'shoulders', 'bop', 'memory-raising', 'tunes', 'call-and-response', 'vocals', 'would', 'come', 'expect', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'as', 'fun', 'ever', 'Keith', 'Strickland', 'guitar', 'work', 'as', 'great', 'ever.', 'Wan', 'enjoy', 'concert', 'iPod', 'car', 'elsewhere', 'Then', ""'re"", 'luck', 'DVD', 'was', 'actually', 'preceded', 'CD', 'very', 'same', 'show', ""n't"", 'that', 'make', 'pogo-stick', 'happy', 'What', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'CD', 'are', 'great', 'interviews', 'are', 'included', 'DVD.The', 'biggest', 'response', 'DVD', 'will', 'create', 'desire', 'B-52s', 'fans', 'country', 'attend', 'be', 'part', 'very', 'special', '35th', 'Anniversary', 'Tour', 'band', 'will', 'undertake', 'summer', 'Certain', 'fortunate', 'towns', 'will', 'even', 'get', 'enjoy', 'shows', 'will', 'be', 'shared', 'band', 'friends', 'Squeeze.The', 'B-52s', 'Wild', 'Crowd', 'available', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'formats.Boomerocity.com']","B52's: With The Wild Crowd!

Between the ultra-clear video, the terrific photography and the amazing sound, it feels almost as if you're there at the concert--except this time, it's up close and personal.  The image, drenched in the colors of a stunning light show, fills an entire 16:9 TV screen.The biggest surprise for me was the vocal power of the two ladies, Kate Pierson (the redhead) and Cindy Wilson (the blonde).  Their voices haven't aged even the slightest bit.  I expected some fudging on the super high notes in some of their earlier songs, but they still sounded as good, if not better than, their recordings.Keith Strickland's guitar work is superb.Fred Schneider is his usual offbeat, subtly sarcastic self, offering up humorous comments between songs.The rest of the band, the keyboardist, bass player, and drummer, is extremely energetic.  It is obvious that all those on stage are having a genuine blast and putting their all into delivering an excellent concert that all ages can enjoy.The Blu-ray also features a sit-down fireside-like chat with all four members of the band.  There is a great deal of discussion about Ricky Wilson, Cindy's brother and former member of the band up until his untimely death.  The four reminisce about their childhoods, how they all met one another, and how they managed to get signed with a major label.

This is simply the B52's at their very best. This concert dvd certainly proves the B52's are the undisputed, ""BEST PARTY BAND IN THE WORLD"", period. The B52's are really ""into it"" and so is the huge, packed crowd, making this one fantastic concert dvd. Watching this live concert dvd is ""almost like being there"", but probably ever better, because of the close-ups, different camera angles and etc.Along with the B52's, you also get additional backing musicians. B52 Band Members Kate, and Cindy are as lovely as ever. I noticed a sign in the crowd that stated ""Ricky is Here"". Ricky Wilson, the original guitarist for the B52's died from AIDS in 1985. He was Cindy's brother. It's was nice to see that he was remembered.Since the Amazon Product Description does not list the songs, then I will. The songs are as follows:1.Pump2.Private Idaho3.Mesoptamia4.Ultraviolet5.Dancing Now6.Give Me Back My Man7.Funplex8.Whammy Kiss9.Deadbeat Club10.Roam11.B52 Girls12.Party Out of Bounds13.Love in the Year 300014.Cosmic Thing15.Hot Corner16.Love Shack (Tin Roof RUSTED!!!!)17.Wig18.Stobe Light19.Planet Claire20.Rock LobsterAlso, you get a bonus Interview with the B52's. This is a very interesting interview, where Keith, Fred, Cindy & Kate recount a history of the band. Fred and Kate were from New Jersey, while Keith, Cindy and the late/great Ricky were from Athens, Georgia (home of The University of Georgia). Also, they recall Ricky's contribution to the band, especially the song ""Rock Lobster"".The only shortcoming I could find, is that the 1992 hit ""Good Stuff"" was not included. However, this in only minor, the rest of the songs are more than good enough to make up for this.The Bottom Line: This is the B52's after 34 years together, performing as only the ""BEST PARTY BAND IN THE WORLD"" can perform.

I love the bonus half hour chat in which Keith, Kate, Fred and Cindy sit together at the Classic Center and reminisce - revealing personal moments complemented by photos from their own collections.The film is dedicated by the band to their late friend, brother and key original band member Ricky Wilson, and they've made sure that this is the ultimate memorial and celebration of life.My first experience of hearing The B-52s was early in 1979 when my flatmate would go into town to Rockinghorse Records import music every Saturday and buy five new LPs by artists he'd never heard of. We fell in love with B-52s immediately and we kept it on high rotation at high volume. Neighbours knocked on our door - not asking to us to turn it down, they wanted to know the name of the band!Their 1980 concert at Brisbane's Festival Hall was the first time the seats had been cleared away, at the request of the band, declaring that space to be ""DANCING ROOM ONLY"". They were astounding live then, and again there for the Cosmic Thing tour (where I loved the bonus of Sara Lee on bass).I travelled with my brother to Sydney for the Funplex tour at the Enmore Theatre, and the only thing that let that show down at all was the PA. So for me a vital benefit of this Blu-Ray is that I can combine the memory of a great personal visual experience with the Blu-ray's faultless high definition close-ups and audio. I appreciate that they've mixed the surround sound to place the viewer in a sweet spot among the crowd. As the show progresses you just want to keep turning up the volume - as the band keeps liberally turning up the energy.It's good to see that quite a few of the audience members are of my own (and the band's) vintage - and while a few of them could certainly have been wilder in response to this legendary party act, many have put in a big effort to dress for the occasion and are clearly having the time of their life.A brilliant high quality performance and production which will make any fan of the B-52s very happy indeed.",5,"Ultimate HD B-52s experience in sight, sound and spoken word",1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,2177,"['Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'B-52s', 'Wild', 'Crowd', 'true', 'state', 'art', 'documentation', 'band', 'height', 'skill', 'enthusiasm', 'love', 'bonus', 'half', 'hour', 'chat', 'Keith', 'Kate', 'Fred', 'Cindy', 'sit', 'together', 'Classic', 'Center', 'reminisce', 'revealing', 'personal', 'moments', 'complemented', 'photos', 'own', 'collections.The', 'film', 'dedicated', 'band', 'late', 'friend', 'brother', 'key', 'original', 'band', 'member', 'Ricky', 'Wilson', ""'ve"", 'made', 'sure', 'ultimate', 'memorial', 'celebration', 'life.My', 'first', 'experience', 'hearing', 'B-52s', 'was', 'early', '1979', 'when', 'flatmate', 'would', 'go', 'town', 'Rockinghorse', 'Records', 'import', 'music', 'Saturday', 'buy', 'five', 'new', 'LPs', 'artists', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'fell', 'love', 'B-52s', 'immediately', 'kept', 'high', 'rotation', 'high', 'volume', 'Neighbours', 'knocked', 'door', 'not', 'asking', 'turn', 'down', 'wanted', 'know', 'name', 'band', '1980', 'concert', 'Brisbane', 'Festival', 'Hall', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'seats', 'had', 'been', 'cleared', 'away', 'request', 'band', 'declaring', 'space', 'be', 'DANCING', 'ROOM', 'ONLY', 'were', 'astounding', 'live', 'then', 'again', 'Cosmic', 'Thing', 'tour', 'where', 'loved', 'bonus', 'Sara', 'Lee', 'bass', 'travelled', 'brother', 'Sydney', 'Funplex', 'tour', 'Enmore', 'Theatre', 'only', 'thing', 'let', 'show', 'down', 'was', 'PA', 'So', 'vital', 'benefit', 'Blu-Ray', 'can', 'combine', 'memory', 'great', 'personal', 'visual', 'experience', 'Blu-ray', 'faultless', 'high', 'definition', 'close-ups', 'audio', 'appreciate', ""'ve"", 'mixed', 'surround', 'sound', 'place', 'viewer', 'sweet', 'spot', 'crowd', 'show', 'just', 'want', 'keep', 'turning', 'up', 'volume', 'band', 'liberally', 'turning', 'up', 'energy.It', 'good', 'see', 'quite', 'few', 'audience', 'members', 'are', 'own', 'band', 'vintage', 'few', 'could', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'wilder', 'response', 'legendary', 'party', 'act', 'many', 'have', 'put', 'big', 'effort', 'dress', 'occasion', 'are', 'clearly', 'having', 'time', 'life.A', 'brilliant', 'high', 'quality', 'performance', 'production', 'will', 'make', 'fan', 'B-52s', 'very', 'happy', 'indeed']","B52's: With The Wild Crowd!

Its great to see and hear Pump and Funplex from their last CD (although would have been nice if they included Juliet of the Spirits, another great track).  Recall first seeing the B-52's perform on (of all things!) The Guiding Light soap opera back in the early 1980's, its now hard to believe they have been around for over three decades.  On this DVD they play all their well known hits in a lively and fun filled concert - obvious the audience has a good time as well.

I couldn't resist this concert recorded at the Classic Center in Athens, and glad i didn't. Even though the girls look their age for the most part, I thought their vocals were the most pleasant surprise of the show. They hit virtually every note, and only the most ardent of fans could see a loss of range or power. Schneider certainly can't screw his performance up, as he doesn't sing. Instrumentally, they sounded pretty tight to me, although I realize we're not talking Rush here.

Houston, we DEFINITELY have lift-off!The material from Funplex really soars here. Songs that I barely noticed on their latest album have now become instant favorites.  Case in point: ""Dancing Now"". I don't even REMEMBER that title!  Now, it is one of my favorite songs!That this release is long overdue goes without saying. Fortunately, ""With the Wild Crowd"" captures the band in top form at an Athens, GA venue that they are very clearly happy to be performing at.  Every album except for the non-Cindy ""Good Stuff"" is represented here and, as much as I like their studio efforts, the live versions here are, almost without exception, far superior.  The band lays down such a tight infectious groove that you can't help but wake up and really get into it. This band is VERY disciplined but they SOUND like they about to fly out of control at any moment!  The groove holds the wackiness on stage into a very tight orbit with almost centrifigal force.The vocal blend of Kate and Cindy is as good as anything I've heard since Michelle Phillips and Cass Eliot sang to the Papas way back in the mid-sixties. Keith's guitar-work is rhythmic and exciting; he samples perhaps the 2 greatest guitar riffs from the sixties (Satisfaction and Day Tripper) in two quite unexpected spots!  And Fred!  He has to be seen to be believed...like the ""Ruler"" from ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" barking out non-sequiters in perfect time! The B-52's vocal attack is unique, bizarre and utterly sublime.The editing is an unexpected gift.  Ordinarily I can't stand music video editing.  It's too frenetic, jumping around constantly from shot to shot, seemingly at random.  Not so here.  It's almost as if the video editor caught the groove switching from Kate to Keith to Cindy to Fred at JUST the right moment!  There is a LOT to watch when the B-52s take the stage and the editors give you everything in just the right doses.As the only post-sixties band to actually embrace psychedelia, the B-52s are truly a wonder to behold.  There is not enough live material of this band available so this is a welome gift indeed.

Unfortunately they are thirty years older too LOL, but unlike some of the other reviews, that not why I chose to go with three stars.  They still sound pretty darn good even if they don't look like kids anymore.  My reason for three stars would have to be with song selection - there are simply a few great songs missing here that should have been played/filmed instead of some of their newer/lesser known songs.  Songs like &#34;Dance This Mess Around&#34;, &#34;Hero Worship&#34;, &#34;Dirty Back Road&#34;, &#34;Summer of Love&#34; all scould have made this show a bit better.  &#34;Song For a Future Generation&#34; would have also been a nice addition but maybe without Ricky they don't like to play it anymore.  Since there has never been an official B-52 DVD before some archival footage would have been an awesome bonus.  Anyway, the sound is good and picture is nice.
