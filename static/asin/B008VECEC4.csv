If you can get it for a good price then I say get it.  But don't be upset if you pay $15 for a 22 minute movie.  Otherwise, it is a worthwhile purchase.It's Christmas and Bikini Bottom as you've never experienced them before! Created entirely in Stop Motion animation, It's a SpongeBob Christmas! is destined to be a holiday classic. This special double-length episode finds all of Bikini Bottom in a festive mood as they prepare for Santa's arrival. But not Plankton, who's once again expecting a lump of coal. So he comes up with his most diabolic new scheme yet, one that practically guarantees he'll finally get the gift he's always wanted - the Krabby Patty secret formula! It's a SpongeBob Christmas! is a tasty tale sure to put the whole family in the holiday spirit!

While it says animated it is more like fuzzy claymation.  Like the old Rudolph the Red Nosed reindeer movie or Frosty the Snowman.  It is one episode of SpongeBob that is all about Christmas.  Plankton wants to of course steal the Krabby Patty formula and he does it by ruining Christmas for everyone.  He puts jerktonium in fruit cakes and gets everyone in Bikini Bottom to eat them and everyone turns into a jerk.  SpongeBob saves the day by having a big heart and caring.Overall, I let my boys (4 and 5) watch this DVD.  They laughed and the lesson they learned is to be nice to everyone and get in the holiday spirit.  They thought the strange animation was fun too and it was a nice change of scenery.  I will say the one weird thing of the DVD though was there was a preview for the new Katie Perry movie in the previews and it doesn't seem like it is the most appropriate for young SpongeBob fans.

1576604,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B008VECEC4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","We have seen Christmas episodes on ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" before, but this time around, the crew wanted to create a special Christmas ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" and this time through stop-motion inspired by Christmas specials of the past.In ""It's a SpongeBob Christmas!"", the DVD features a Christmas episode as everyone in Bikini Bottom is excited for Christmas and Santa to come and visit the area.  But Plankton who has been receiving nothing but coal, comes up with a plan to taint fruit cake with jerktonium and making everyone bad so their Christmas is ruined.But when Plankton tries the tainted fruit cake on SpongeBob, it doesn't work.  So, Plankton figures his invention is not working and thus gives the Jerktonium maker to SpongeBob, who decides to give everyone in Bikini Bottom some of Plankton's delicious fruit cake.But when everyone starts acting like a jerk after eating the tainted fruitcake, what happens when Santa comes to Bikini Bottom?  Will they get presents or a lump of coal?What is SpongeBob SquarePants?For over a decade, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" has become such a tremendous hit for Nickelodeon and an animated series that many children have grown up with. A popular franchise which includes video games, the character featured on a variety of food products, toys, health-related items and more. Needless to say, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"", although not a series shown on broadcast television, has managed to become a character that is part of American pop culture and still shows no signs of waning, especially with a new group of young viewers every year.Created by Stephen Hillenburg in 1999, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" is an animated series about a group of characters that live in the underwater city known as ""Bikini Bottom"".The main character of ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" are:SpongeBob SquarePants - A energetic and naive sea sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea with his pet snail Gary and works as a cook for The Krusty Krab. He enjoys hanging out with his best friend Patrick.Patrick Star - A pink starfish and the best friend of SpongeBob. Known for his ignorance and stupidity but still a good friend to SpongeBob.Squidward Tentacles - An egotistical cephalopod (squid or octopus) who works as a cashier at the Krusty Krab and although he doesn't care for SpongeBob, he tolerates him.Sandy Cheeks - A squirrel who is a science genius and lives in an underwater dome who hails from Texas.Mr. Krabs - The money-loving boss of The Krusty Krab restaurant and boss of SpongeBob and Squidward.Plankton - The nemesis of Mr. Krabs who runs the rival restaurant, The Chum Bucket.VIDEO & AUDIO:""SpongeBob SquarePants: It's a SpongeBob Christmas!"" is featured in full screen and audio is featured in Dolby Digital English Stereo.  This is the first ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" episode featured in stop-motion, so this is the first episode not animated and the characters are presented via in foam or fabric.  Picture quality is good for DVD and the stop motion, especially the movement of the characters was excellent, especially planning the mouth movements to the dialogue.  Lighting and overall look of Bikini Bottom was also well-done!Dialogue is in 5.1 Dolby Digital stereo, front channel driven, dialogue and music is clear and understandable.SPECIAL FEATURES:""SpongeBob SquarePants: It's a SpongeBob Christmas!"" comes with the following special features:Behind-the-Scenes Feature - (7:16) The making of ""It's a SpongeBob Christmas!"".  Creating a stop-motion classic Christmas feel.Animatic - (24:25) Watch the complete episode with the animatic sketches.Yule Log - If you want to watch an animated yule-log during the holidays!MP3 Compatible Songs - Comes with the MP3&#8242;s for ""Santa's Eyes"" and ""Hot Fruitcake"" (note: You must put the DVD into a DVD-Rom drive to access the two MP3 files).JUDGMENT CALL:Just in time for the holidays, ""SpongeBob SquarePants: It's a SpongeBob Christmas!"" is an entertaining Christmas episode and for the first time, presenting SpongeBob and friends, especially the underwater world of Bikini Bottom in stop-motion.The DVD features one episode, so it's a bit short at 22-minutes, but you do get a few special features included with this DVD release.My home is ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" mania for my nine-year-old. For the past five years, he has been a big fan of the animated series and has wanted everything that the character is featured on, may it be yogurt to toothpaste, he is a SpongeBob maniac and both us were pretty excited to see this Christmas episode and see how the characters look via stop-motion.The crew did a wonderful job in creating the world of Bikini Bottom but also creating the characters for stop-motion.  The movements resembled the series and while created in stop-motion, the series felt natural and of course maintained the hilarious and crazy aspect of the the animated series via stop-motion.And with the theme being Christmas-related, I have no doubt that children and the entire family will enjoy ""SpongeBob SquarePants: It's a SpongeBob Christmas!"".  For kids, they will enjoy the crazy transformation of the characters as they eat the tainted fruit cake, while parents who grew up watching the classic stop-motion animated Christmas specials as a child, will be thrilled to see this tradition continue with this special Christmas episode of ""SpongeBob SquarePants"".While the DVD is short, I did wish there were extra episodes included especially past ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" Christmas episodes.  But on its own, if you are a parent and your children love ""SpongeBob SquarePants"", this DVD will no doubt keep them entertained during the holidays!  Recommended!",4,(3.5 stars) A fun Spongebob Christmas special but very short on DVD!

Unfortunately, I was wrong.Plankton hides an element known as Jerktonium in order to land everyone else in Bikini Bottom on the naughty list in slices of fruitcake, which he then proceeds to feed to everyone to ruin their holiday spirit. It works on everyone except SpongeBob, who is too infatuated with the holidays to be at all bothered by the fruitcake. Typical newer episode material, without much witty humor (minus Patrick's goal to trap Santa Claus so Christmas won't ever have to end for him, which I found quite funny. Classic Patrick material right there. Sadly, we don't get to see much of that).Albeit I love the stop-motion element to the special, I really did not enjoy much else about the special. Believe me when I say this, I genuinely, genuinely wanted to like this. I really did. But I really see no reason for them to produce an extra Christmas-themed episode for the series when they have already made another perfectly-fine holiday special.

1576623,AIJJB21124MW3,B008VECEC4,William of Florida,"[3, 4]","The real test of quality for this episode is whether or not it holds up without the stop-motion. Had this been a regular cel/digitally animated SpongeBob special, would I have enjoyed it? I think the answer is 'yes.' Does it hold up to ""Christmas Who?"" Mmmm... maybe not. At least, not in terms of writing.The early seasons of SpongeBob were tonally different than the current seasons. ""Christmas Who?"" was one of the best episodes of Season 2 and still holds up today, even though the current approach to SpongeBob is a little more hyperactive and juvenile. That's not to say the show isn't still funny. It is! But it's a different show now than it was a decade ago, which is understandable. Kids have changed.That said, I think ""It's a SpongeBob Christmas"" is one of the best episodes of the show I've seen in a long time. The humor is good all throughout, the characters are well utilized, and the musical numbers are well placed. The moral of the story is ""Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas)."" Yes, that song is in there, though edited for time.The animation itself is superb. This is some really top notch stop-motion. They capture the Rankin/Bass look really well in the Patchy segments (which may be the funniest Patchy moments ever) and the way Bikini Bottom translates to stop-motion is really impressive. They put a lot of care into making sure everything and everyone moved like they do in normal cel-animated form. I reccomend watching the making-of mini-doc. It's short and shows how clever they got with this.I will add to all of this by saying that I don't know that buying the DVD was worth it. I really like what's on it, but for what you get, it is better to spend the extra three bucks to get the one that comes with the other Christmas DVD....Or just wait until December. You know as well as I do that Nickelodeon will play this pretty nonstop in the days leading up to Christmas. So there's no hurry to buy it.
