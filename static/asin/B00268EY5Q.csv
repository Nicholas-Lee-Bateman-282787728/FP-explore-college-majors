I always smile when I see him walking off with his blue plastic carry bags - can you imagine Dr Hill with a briefcase? It's little things like this that make this series one that rates with the very best of any drama show. I preferred Carol as his partner - there was always that simmering undertow of will they, won't they - not there now with his new partner Alex. The supporting cast is very strong and it is a great pity that the proposed Series 7 was cancelled. I'm sure it would have been as big a hit as the previous 6.Do try and watch the whole series from the beginning - to me the ONLY let down was the one episode that was shot in USA - somehow didn't work with Tony out of his usual surroundings.In closing, I was amazed to read someone who wrote that it needed subtitles!! We get so much US television in our homes, whether we live in UK, Australia or any other English speaking country - we don't require closed captions to understand American accents, no matter what part of the country they are from!! We manage well without needing CC or subtitles, which I thought were reserved for 'foreign' languages - English is the language of America, not American.",5,Oddball psych put out to grass,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,1444,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'characters', 'Robson', 'Green', 'dysfunctional', 'psychologist', 'Dr', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'brilliantly', 'will', 'be', 'missed.The', 'Brits', 'certainly', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'slightly', 'different', 'TV', 'drama', 'series', 'be', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'always', 'smile', 'when', 'see', 'walking', 'off', 'blue', 'plastic', 'carry', 'bags', 'can', 'imagine', 'Dr', 'Hill', 'briefcase', 'little', 'things', 'make', 'series', 'one', 'rates', 'very', 'best', 'drama', 'show', 'preferred', 'Carol', 'partner', 'was', 'always', 'simmering', 'undertow', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'not', 'there', 'now', 'new', 'partner', 'Alex', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'strong', 'great', 'pity', 'proposed', 'Series', '7', 'was', 'cancelled', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'hit', 'previous', '6.Do', 'try', 'watch', 'whole', 'series', 'beginning', 'ONLY', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'shot', 'USA', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Tony', 'usual', 'surroundings.In', 'closing', 'was', 'amazed', 'read', 'someone', 'who', 'wrote', 'needed', 'subtitles', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'US', 'television', 'homes', 'live', 'UK', 'Australia', 'other', 'English', 'speaking', 'country', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'closed', 'captions', 'understand', 'American', 'accents', 'matter', 'what', 'part', 'country', 'are', 'manage', 'well', 'needing', 'CC', 'subtitles', 'thought', 'were', 'reserved', ""'foreign"", 'languages', 'English', 'language', 'America', 'not', 'American']",Wire in the Blood: Season 6
1251328,A2HCS608K512VS,B00268EY5Q,"Barbara Amell ""editor, Wingfold""","[4, 22]","Wire in the Blood is one of the most important and valuable series ever produced for television. Over the past five seasons it has consistently presented detailed information on how the human mind functions via its clinical psychologist hero Dr. Tony Hill, brilliantly played by Robson Green. While the plots involved graphic stories of violent crimes, these were not presented in a voyeuristic fashion--a tricky balancing act, but an important one for a show devoted to mental health. In episode one of season six, its final season, Wire in the Blood violates that rule with a vengeance, offering a story line on a sado-masochistic sex club in a manner designed to tittilate rather than educate its audience. This impression is exacerbated by the absence of any theories from Dr. Hill on why people enter into violent relationships, and by no apparent indications he regards degrading or being degraded as problematic behavior. When DI Alex Fielding (Simone Lahbib) learns one of her officers was involved in sadistic sex with a victim, she tells him in disgust to ""go home and sort your head out."" How is he supposed to do that? Dr. Hill offers no clue.In past seasons of Wire in the Blood we learned about the addictive aspects of pornography and its prevalent role in crimes against women. In episode two of the final season Dr. Hill giggles and jokes when he learns while checking into a hotel that a large majority of the guests order a porn channel. The episode of exceptionally fine quality that follows is capped off by Dr. Hill being revived from the dead to proclaim there is nothing on the other side. In light of the numerous people who have had near-death experiences with a God of love, and the hope such testimonies hold out for humanity, this is a bizarre and shameful conclusion for a television show to foist onto the public. What does Dr. Hill think of the many historical witnesses to an aferlife? Who affiliated with the show did the 'research' to justify a conclusion contrary to these accounts?In episode three of the final season Dr. Hill quotes the teachings of Jesus, albeit incorrectly, in an attempt to expose the staged conversion of a convicted cannibal killer. Yet in the same episode Hill uses the word 'Jesus' as a potentially censorable adjective for supposed comic effect, and ridicules the Christian religion for aspects that had nothing to do with its foundations. In one scene Hill and Fielding gleefully bond over their mutual unbelief in front of her son. No decent mother, atheist or otherwise, can be happy over the prospect that the child she loves body and soul may one day vanish into Byron's so-called ""dark day of nothingness."" The scene rings ludicrously false, and it is to her credit that the polished actress Simone Lahbib looks desperately uncomfortable trying to pull it off: such callous indifference to the fate of her boy is not in keeping with the character she has consistently played so well. In another scene Dr. Hill flings a Bible over his shoulder onto the floor. Jesus told the world that God is Love, that we are capable of loving as God loves, of being merciful as God is merciful. Until we make an attempt to take him seriously, we have no idea of what human beings are truly capable of: this is a format of development that psychology, for all its important advancements, does not, cannot touch. Jesus said that the pure in heart shall see God; this is the one format of proof for His existence that individuals are capable of executing for themselves. Jesus taught kindness, compassion and peace; he denounced corruption among the religious leaders of his time and submitted to trials whose transcripts documented evidence for the Jewish people of what their so-called religious leaders truly were. His followers risked their lives and gave their lives getting that evidence in writing and preserving it from destruction at the hands of those whose guilt it exposed. Such records are a testimony to the secretive corruption that can thrive in religious heirarchies and the importance of combating it, a warning that contemporary reporting on church corruption reveals is still necessary today. Any book containing the histories of such a man and such a religion does not deserve to be treated with less respect than a used Kleenex, and no medical professional who advocates logic, denounces superficial research, and disdains the 'quick fix,' as Dr. Hill has, would do so. Unlike Lahbib, Green looks so comfortable with this radical departure from the nature of his character that he does not appear to be acting. In the interview with the cannibal killer Dr. Hill avoids answering his questions to take away his sense of control. Had Hill not tossed aside an important reference book, he could have observed the number of times Jesus reportedly employed the same technique with those who intended him harm; this was an important skill to cultivate in a society where what you said could get you killed. Episode three culminates with two kidnapped strangers being forced at gun-point to mate in a cage. The scene is presented with the same voyeuristic lingering that this show once avoided.In episode four Fielding experiences a death in the family. She asks Dr. Hill if he ever wonders what life is all about; he simply and humbly nods ""Yes."" In this more rational atmosphere the show returns to its former glory, and Green's erratic performance from episode three thankfully vanishes. As in past seasons, we learn much about human behavior, and the scenes of violence are suspenseful but not gratuitous.The Established Church has much to answer for in its centuries-old cover-ups of crimes committed by its clergy, and the consequent eroding of its doctrines: the mandate of eternal damnation effective by the sixth century, the emphasis on blood sacrifice rather than the stand against secretive religious corruption that the trials and execution of Jesus so obviously represented. Good people may well turn away repulsed from such a church and such a God; the recoil is a sacred instinct. But one honest hour spent reading about what Jesus actually said and did is enough to dispel any distortions that writhed up in the religion that bears his name, and those who heap abuse on this religion as a whole betray the sad fact that they have never bothered to spend that one honest hour. It is no accident that Jesus Christ is the one figure in Western history to have his name reduced to a format of profanity: until people apprehend the value of inexorable love, they will be desperate to distance themselves from its demands, and the farther they run the lower they will sink. Genuine belief requires reasons; yet all of us act every day on things we cannot prove. Faith and logic are not two conflicting states of mind, as so many religious and secular proponents claim: they are necessary correlates for growth, and we ignore the one to the detriment of the other. Love is the ultimate source of logic, for love alone provides genuine insight. When the producers of Wire in the Blood resorted instead to scorn, ridicule and negligence, they served up the same type of rotted fruit as the institutional church they attacked. The public owes a great debt to this show for the information it provided in past seasons, and we may all be thankful that it ended well with the final episode. But the prior episodes of season six offered warped and erroneous views on the most vital of subjects, and the audience this show has served so well in the past deserves to know better, as do the producers of Wire in the Blood. This program has long born the stamp of a conscience at its heart, of a desire to do good. I hope this review returns the favor.Barbara Amell, editor, Wingfold",1,A Plea for Sanity,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,7748,"['Wire', 'Blood', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'valuable', 'series',

It is a very faithful recreation of the novels with perfect casting of Robson Green as psychologist Tony Hill.  Carol is no longer his policewoman partner but she has been well replaced by Alex Fielding.  Hill is especially a misfit in much of regular society and is only at his best when delving into the criminal mind.  Green perfected all of Hill's tics so that he is seen in all of his odd duck glory. These are all murder cases and most of them are serial murders.  I've enjoyed every season of this series and am sad to hear this one is evidently the last. The British do a marvelous job on tv mystery and crime series.  One thing that especially distinguishes a British series is that it never takes the easy way out.  If it is better for the show, the UK series will go the the extra mile by killing off characters and taking other unpopular plot twists which are anathema in an American series.  An American series always has more of a Disney patina to it regardless of which studio made the series. We in America rarely can resist adding schmaltz, sentimentality and morals to our tv series.  The British are made of sterner stuff, as they say.  I've also read Val McDermid's novels of Tony & Carol.  They are excellent and much more detailed and complex than the tv series.

Such is not usually the case; most of these episodes retain the characters created by McDermid, but are not her plots. The dynamic between Tony and DI Fielding has settled down from its earlier antagonistic vibe; Alex is softer, more feminine and not as biting as she used to be.  It seemed like they were priming us for a romance to develop between Tony and Alex, and now we will not see that happen.  As a staunch Carol Jordan supporter, I am just as glad about that!  There was no apparent attempt made to tie off loose ends, with the final episode ending ambiguously, which makes me wonder whether another season had in fact been planned before the plug was pulled.  All is not lost, however: Val McDermid has just come out with another Tony-Carol book, so our shy forensic lovers continue to have lives on the page.  Here's hoping the success of this show will propel Robson Green to long-deserved movie stardom in America, now that he has the time.",3,Blood-Letting,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,1406,"['good', 'things', 'must', 'come', 'end', 'alas', '6', 'seasons', 'road', 'come', 'end', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'least', 'BBC', 'incarnation', 'final', 'season', 'few', 'strongest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'while', 'Robson', 'Green', 'dropped', 'many', 'Dr.', 'Hill', 'more', 'endearing', 'idiosyncracies', 'past', 'two', 'seasons', 'patented', 'tics', 'return', 'force', 'Falls', 'Shadow', 'episode', 'lifted', 'directly', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'novel', 'Such', 'not', 'usually', 'case', 'most', 'episodes', 'retain', 'characters', 'created', 'McDermid', 'are', 'not', 'plots', 'dynamic', 'Tony', 'DI', 'Fielding', 'settled', 'down', 'earlier', 'antagonistic', 'vibe', 'Alex', 'softer', 'more', 'feminine', 'not', 'as', 'biting', 'used', 'be', 'seemed', 'were', 'priming', 'romance', 'develop', 'Tony', 'Alex', 'now', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'happen', 'staunch', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'supporter', 'am', 'just', 'glad', 'was', 'apparent', 'attempt', 'made', 'tie', 'off', 'loose', 'ends', 'final', 'episode', 'ending', 'ambiguously', 'wonder', 'season', 'had', 'fact', 'been', 'planned', 'plug', 'was', 'pulled', 'not', 'lost', 'however', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'Tony-Carol', 'book', 'shy', 'forensic', 'lovers', 'continue', 'have', 'lives', 'page', 'Here', 'hoping', 'success', 'show', 'will', 'propel', 'Robson', 'Green', 'long-deserved', 'movie', 'stardom', 'America', 'now', 'time']",Wire in the Blood: Season 6
1251335,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B00268EY5Q,Jack E. Levic,"[0, 0]","It's series SIX of WIRE IN THE BLOOD and the Bradfield Police Department is still dealing with one serial killer after another. The murder rate is awfully high in this city. Psychologist Tony Hill comes to the rescue of the overwhelmed Bradfield Police Department. Robson Green is absolutely fantastic as the quirky and somewhat mysterious Dr. Tony Hill. While it is an exceptionally well-done police detective series, WIRE IN THE BLOOD is brutally unnerving in his explicit portayals of serial killings. It's not a series to watch alone. The gruesome killings are very graphic by American TV show standards.Dr. Hill tries to get into the minds of the killers and to weed out suspects. Some are guilt of lesser crimes but our Dr. Hill sorts it out in the end. DEAD LAND is the final episode of the series. Detective Inspector Alex Fielding finally attempts to delve into Dr. Hill's personal life and seems to be showing some romantic interest. Surprisingly for this final episode, she is called away for much of the show. Another detective takes her place and he happens to be an immense fan of Dr.Hill. He was an interesting character to bring in the last episode...almost a Watson to Hill's Sherlock Holmes. Odd this new dynamic was entered in the last episode..though perhaps, at the time a Series Seven was planned.WIRE IN THE BLOOD is a well-written and suspenseful show with constant plot twists. The obvious culprit rarely is exactly that. Only Dr. Hill can sort it all out. It's sad to see the series end, but there are plenty of episodes to enjoy. The violence is overly graphic at times.

As a professional of many years, a shrink specializing in human sexuality, I review the series for accuracy in addition to entertainment. I give the team kudos for their ability to maintain excellent research for the subject matter in addition to the production team. WHAT HAPPENED???PLEASE IF ANYONE ELSE HAS EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM I WOULD TRULY APPRECIATE LEARNING WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO REMEDY THE SITUATION. This series has been produced by E1. I have 2 excellent dvd players. Sony BR & Phillips all region. Two disc sets have behaved in this manner. First in the BR player, the logo E1 appears, the disc sits for 20 seconds, then nothing. In the all region player it begins to play however it is muddy, grainy, and impossible to hear let alone watch. Then Amazon UK provided its' version from a different studio and the identical poor to watch version appeared.Amazon had tried its'best to help but their response it that ""no one else has reported this problem and the holding bins are fine"". Not possible for me to be the only person having this problem. Curious not to see anyone else reporting same. Yes this series leaves one to wonder what direction CBS will attempt for the future. But I would be delighted to have the opportunity to see this series in the high quality as before. Tony Hill must survive to portray the reality that truly exists and behaves in our human condition.
