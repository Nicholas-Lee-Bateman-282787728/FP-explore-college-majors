1026161,AWGAEZ2JFGUSP,B000JCE816,"C. P. Gilmore ""Mad Modeler""","[3, 5]","In the annals of World War II history one finds a plethora of information about the soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought the war.  It's usually about the infantry and the paratroopers, about the tank battles, the air battles, the sea battles and the war on the home front and how they all combined their efforts to win the war.  But how much do we hear about another aspect of air warfare, the gliders and the men who flew them to deliver the heavy goods to the troops who parachuted behind the lines?This film explains the history of the glider corps, the concept of aerial delivery in use before the present day airdrop of heavy equipment in a combat zone was perfected in the post-WWII era.  It covers the selection of glider pilots, men who wanted to be Air Corps pilots but, for various reasons, were unable to qualify for powered aircraft ratings, the design of WWII gliders, both Allied and Axis, and a brief history of every major glider operation during the war beginning with the German assaults in Belgium in 1940 and Crete in 1941, the US/British actions in Burma, Normandy, Southern France and Holland, and the Rhine Crossings in 1945.Interviews with former glider pilots throughout the film add a personal touch to this great story of a group of men who entered a combat zone as professional airmen but who quickly became infantrymen once they delivered their goods.  Trained to cut loose from their tow aircraft and land in the middle of a combat zone 30 seconds later with their cargoes of humans and heavy equipment, they were not only responsible for delivering their cargo safely but were expected to fight along side their fellow troopers until they were no longer needed in the combat zone and could be evacuated back to their bases in time for their next drop.
