In a lot of ways. I really connect with a lot of his songs, especially ""Darkness""-although the live version included here is a sped up version of the original, it still gives me goosebumps.  As does this live version of ""Insasiable"". Absolutely stunning. As I was saying, the biggest reason watching this makes me sad is because, an entertainer, such as Darren, that I love, and have loved since day one, is not commercially successful in the USA and therefore, I probably will never see him live. And that really sucks.  Because being there is a whole different experience. But I will take what I can get, I guess.I have to be honest though, about one thing that disappointed me... The setlist. Yes, I understand that this is a tour to promote his latest album.  But I could have done without some of the tracks. Although, I wouldn't have been surprised if he didn't include any Savage Garden songs.  I am disappointed in the ones he did chose. ""Best Thing""???? ""Affirmation""??? Those are good songs, but no where near his best.  I think ""Gunning Down Romance"", ""To the Moon and Back"" and ""Break Me Shake Me"", would have fit right in.  His first solo album was basically ignored, and I am shocked at the lack of songs sung from the Spark album.But, all in all, this dvd as a whole makes up for any complaints that I may have.  Any lover of good music should own a copy of this.",5,AMAZING!!!!!,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,1520,"['concert', 'amazing', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'energy', 'Darren', 'performances', 'are', 'incredible', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'made', 'little', 'sad', 'lot', 'ways', 'really', 'connect', 'lot', 'songs', 'especially', 'Darkness', 'live', 'version', 'included', 'here', 'sped', 'up', 'version', 'original', 'still', 'goosebumps', 'live', 'version', 'Insasiable', 'Absolutely', 'stunning', 'was', 'saying', 'biggest', 'reason', 'watching', 'sad', 'because', 'entertainer', 'such', 'Darren', 'love', 'have', 'loved', 'day', 'one', 'not', 'commercially', 'successful', 'USA', 'therefore', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'live', 'really', 'sucks', 'being', 'whole', 'different', 'experience', 'will', 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'guess.I', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'setlist', 'Yes', 'understand', 'tour', 'promote', 'latest', 'album', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'tracks', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'Savage', 'Garden', 'songs', 'am', 'disappointed', 'ones', 'did', 'chose', 'Best', 'Thing', 'Affirmation', 'are', 'good', 'songs', 'where', 'best', 'think', 'Gunning', 'Down', 'Romance', 'Moon', 'Back', 'Break', 'Me', 'Shake', 'Me', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'right', 'first', 'solo', 'album', 'was', 'basically', 'ignored', 'am', 'shocked', 'lack', 'songs', 'sung', 'Spark', 'album.But', 'dvd', 'whole', 'up', 'complaints', 'may', 'have', 'lover', 'good', 'music', 'should', 'own', 'copy']",N/A

It is sustained entertainment right through and covers many musical moods and styles. It stands well as theatre too. The backing band even seem to be really into it and enyoying it. Darren is a mature performer and songwriter who gives a very generous performance that doesn't wane. There is some really intersting music and great beat. I didnt know many of the songs before I watched and immediately was into them. I just want to add that I've been into rock type music since the 60s which puts me outside many of the age-groups that may usually look at him. So I want to add that my generation would get a lot out of this too if anyone is looking for something new.,5,Solid excellence for all age groups,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,753,"['Everything', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'totally', 'support', 'such', 'great', 'concert', 'sustained', 'entertainment', 'right', 'covers', 'many', 'musical', 'moods', 'styles', 'well', 'theatre', 'too', 'backing', 'band', 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'really', 'enyoying', 'Darren', 'mature', 'performer', 'songwriter', 'who', 'very', 'generous', 'performance', ""n't"", 'wane', 'really', 'intersting', 'music', 'great', 'beat', 'didnt', 'know', 'many', 'songs', 'watched', 'immediately', 'was', 'just', 'want', 'add', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rock', 'type', 'music', '60s', 'many', 'age-groups', 'may', 'usually', 'look', 'So', 'want', 'add', 'generation', 'would', 'get', 'lot', 'too', 'anyone', 'looking', 'something', 'new']",N/A

Well afew years past and I really didn't hear much from him.Then in 2007 I was flipping thru the channels and I ended up on LOGO and I saw this incredible music video (with this awesome song). The weird thing was that the singer looked and sounded so familiar to me. It turned out that it was Darren with his music video ""On the Verge of Something Wonderful."" I immediately ran on the computer went on amazon.com and bought his CD ""This Delicate thing We've Made."" When I got it I couldn't stop listening to it it was smart, clever, and I think HIS BEST CD EVER!!!Now, I know most of you who are reading this are wondering what the Hell this has to do with the concert, but, one of my friends had the pleasure of seeing him in concert and he told me that the show was great. The best song he performs is ""Casey""(which is coincidentally the best song on the CD) and that he compared it to a Madonna show (only it was a little more intimate).If you like Darren it would be extremely wise for you to get this DVD. Oh, and if you want to see Darren in concert check out the Savage Garden DVD ""Live and on Tour in Australia.""",5,"Darren, Thank You For Giving Us Your Best Concert Ever On DVD",1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,1260,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Darren', 'Haye', 'first', 'solo', 'album', 'Spin', 'always', 'assumed', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'carrier', 'solo', 'Savage', 'Garden', 'Well', 'years', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'much', 'him.Then', '2007', 'was', 'flipping', 'channels', 'ended', 'up', 'LOGO', 'saw', 'incredible', 'music', 'video', 'awesome', 'song', 'weird', 'thing', 'was', 'singer', 'looked', 'sounded', 'so', 'familiar', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'Darren', 'music', 'video', 'Verge', 'Something', 'Wonderful', 'immediately', 'ran', 'computer', 'went', 'amazon.com', 'bought', 'CD', 'Delicate', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'Made', 'When', 'got', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'listening', 'was', 'smart', 'clever', 'think', 'HIS', 'BEST', 'CD', 'EVER', 'Now', 'know', 'most', 'who', 'are', 'reading', 'are', 'wondering', 'what', 'Hell', 'do', 'concert', 'one', 'friends', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'concert', 'told', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'best', 'song', 'Casey', 'coincidentally', 'best', 'song', 'CD', 'compared', 'Madonna', 'show', 'only', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'intimate', '.If', 'Darren', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'wise', 'get', 'DVD', 'Oh', 'want', 'see', 'Darren', 'concert', 'check', 'Savage', 'Garden', 'DVD', 'Live', 'Tour', 'Australia']",N/A
1160217,A329U9CDUPKXAC,B0018FZIUS,Patrick,"[1, 1]",Darren sounds pitch perfect in all the songs in this concert and he really knows how to put on a good performance. The lighting and stage design was done very well. I think the only way I could have enjoyed it more is if I actually got to be there. The people in the audience were incredibly lucky.This is one purchase I will never regret.

1160218,A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B0018FZIUS,"Stella Carrier ""joyfulwoman2078""","[1, 1]","""The Time Machine Tour"" by Darren Hayes is a very engaging and unique concert to watch. The title obviously gives away the time machine tour, and this is what makes it even more interesting to watch if you are open-minded to the potential concept of time machines. I say this because the songs that he selected go with the concept of time travel. Darren does a good job with ensuring that what he sings is in alignment with the theme.  The following is the list of the music that he goes through in the concert:Introduction1.The Future Holds a Lion's Heart2. Who Would Have Thought3, How to Build a Time Machine4, Neverland5. Insatiable6. On the Verge of Something Wonderful7. Listen All You People8. The Best Thing9. The Only One10. Void11. Darkness12. Step Into the Light13. I Like the Way14, Words15. Casey16. So Beautiful17, I Want You18. Affirmation19. Me, Myself,& I20  The Great Big Disconnect (basically the closing of the concert)My favorite performances of the concert are  ""Insatiable"", ""On the Verge of Something Wonderful,""""I Like the Way,"" ""So Beautiful,"" and ""I Want You"" (this musical classic as many know is from timeframe when Darren was in Savage Garden).  What I also enjoyed about the concert is how Darren puts alot of energy and passion into both his singing of the songs and the discussions that he gives before playing his music.  For example, he gives a healing reminder when he implies that it is more joyful to make peace with anything in your life that you wish to have gone back in time to change instead of being concerned with what could have been done differently. Part of me already knew this, but it is always good to be reminded of such helpful insights when being entertained. I find many of his songs on his ""Spin"" cd to be enjoyable, and this ""Time Machine Tour"" dvd is an uplifting addition to my collection. The ""Time Machine Tour"" dvd is best enjoyed by anyone who likes pop, dance, and/or electronica music.  On a side, this also reminds me (in a positive way) of the fun Adam Lambert Glam Nation Live dvd that I watched less than a week ago. I say this because Darren's music is very high-energy and creative (much like Adam's).  In my humble opinion, the possibility of Adam Lambert and Darren Hayes performing at a concert together one day would be very exciting.  I also must say that many who like any of Darren's songs (whether from his solo albums and/or Savage Garden) are also going to enjoy ""The Time Machine Tour"" dvd.",5,"""Tour of Time Machine Fun""",1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,2472,"['Time', 'Machine', 'Tour', 'Darren', 'Hayes', 'very', 'engaging', 'unique', 'concert', 'watch', 'title', 'obviously', 'away', 'time', 'machine', 'tour', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch', 'are', 'open-minded', 'potential', 'concept', 'time', 'machines', 'say', 'songs', 'selected', 'go', 'concept', 'time', 'travel', 'Darren', 'good', 'job', 'ensuring', 'what', 'alignment', 'theme', 'following', 'list', 'music', 'concert', 'Introduction1.The', 'Future', 'Holds', 'Lion', 'Heart2', 'Who', 'Would', 'Have', 'Thought3', 'How', 'Build', 'Time', 'Machine4', 'Neverland5', 'Insatiable6', 'Verge', 'Something', 'Wonderful7', 'Listen', 'People8', 'Best', 'Thing9', 'Only', 'One10', 'Void11', 'Darkness12', 'Step', 'Into', 'Light13', 'Way14', 'Words15', 'Casey16', 'So', 'Beautiful17', 'Want', 'You18', 'Affirmation19', 'Me', 'Myself', 'I20', 'Great', 'Big', 'Disconnect', 'basically', 'closing', 'concert', 'favorite', 'performances', 'concert', 'are', 'Insatiable', 'Verge', 'Something', 'Wonderful', 'Way', 'So', 'Beautiful', 'Want', 'musical', 'classic', 'many', 'know', 'timeframe', 'when', 'Darren', 'was', 'Savage', 'Garden', 'What', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'concert', 'how', 'Darren', 'alot', 'energy', 'passion', 'singing', 'songs', 'discussions', 'playing', 'music', 'example', 'healing', 'reminder', 'when', 'more', 'joyful', 'make', 'peace', 'anything', 'life', 'wish', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'time', 'change', 'instead', 'being', 'concerned', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'Part', 'already', 'knew', 'always', 'good', 'be', 'reminded', 'such', 'helpful', 'insights', 'when', 'being', 'entertained', 'find', 'many', 'songs', 'Spin', 'cd', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Tour', 'dvd', 'uplifting', 'addition', 'collection', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Tour', 'dvd', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'who', 'pop', 'dance', 'and/or', 'electronica', 'music', 'side', 'also', 'positive', 'way', 'fun', 'Adam', 'Lambert', 'Glam', 'Nation', 'Live', 'dvd', 'watched', 'less', 'week', 'ago', 'say', 'Darren', 'music', 'very', 'high-energy', 'creative', 'much', 'Adam', 'humble', 'opinion', 'possibility', 'Adam', 'Lambert', 'Darren', 'Hayes', 'performing', 'concert', 'together', 'one', 'day', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'exciting', 'also', 'must', 'say', 'many', 'who', 'Darren', 'songs', 'solo', 'albums', 'and/or', 'Savage', 'Garden', 'are', 'also', 'going', 'enjoy', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Tour', 'dvd']",N/A
