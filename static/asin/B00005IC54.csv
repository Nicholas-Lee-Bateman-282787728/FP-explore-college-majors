The cult status this thing enjoys is richly deserved. It has it all, it's funny, violent, engaging and dramatic. Dafoe is great as always as a gay FBI agent on the trail of Reedus and Flanery who are 2 Irish brothers sick of the crime and evil they have to endure everyday. They decide to strike back, and they do it with a vengeance. Alternately hilarious and thrilling; this movie does what big Hollywood action movies try and fail to do so often. Boondock Saints is clever, visceral and does not contain a dull moment. Plus Billy Connolly enjoys his best part since ""Head of the Class"". This is one not to be missed by anyone who likes action movies that are a little smarter than the usual garbage cranked out every year.",5,now this is the stuff of great action films!,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,839,"['kept', 'hearing', 'things', 'movie', 'college', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'friend', 'copy', 'Wow', 'cult', 'status', 'thing', 'richly', 'deserved', 'funny', 'violent', 'engaging', 'dramatic', 'Dafoe', 'great', 'as', 'always', 'gay', 'FBI', 'agent', 'trail', 'Reedus', 'Flanery', 'who', 'are', '2', 'Irish', 'brothers', 'sick', 'crime', 'evil', 'have', 'endure', 'everyday', 'decide', 'strike', 'back', 'do', 'vengeance', 'Alternately', 'hilarious', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'what', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'movies', 'try', 'fail', 'do', 'so', 'often', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'clever', 'visceral', 'not', 'contain', 'dull', 'moment', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'best', 'part', 'Head', 'Class', 'one', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'anyone', 'who', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'little', 'smarter', 'usual', 'garbage', 'cranked', 'out', 'year']",The Boondock Saints

While you watched, did you have a passing thought or even verbalized what you would do if you could get your hands on the scum? The Boondock Saints carries this out to its fullest. Two brothers lay asleep on a stormy night, when suddenly they recieve a message from God to destroy to evil doers of their city. Thus, the massacre begins.William Dafoe plays a very confused gay FBI agent, that apparently dislikes gays. He is a massive highlight to Boondock, as he prances around barking orders and slowly spinning towards insanity trying to figure the motivation of the Saints. In this world no one kills bad guys just because they're bad guys, do they? He might like the idea...The imperfections, according to this reviewer, come in with some massive improbabilities as far as furthering the story. Basically some Deus Ex Machina's and some downright luck. But, hey I guess that could be said about most movies anyway. No one watches Big Fish or Wizard of Oz because its probable.The most unexpected and hilarious moment come with the execution of a cat, and the response the frustrated Rocco gives to its owners. Almost every scene has a good laugh.I am a MASSIVE Sean Patrick Flannery fan. I think that with the right material he could quickly be an A-lister. The Critically bashed, Hugely underappreciated, and mis-studied film ""Powder"" is one of my top ten favorites. You can also see him in The Grass Harp. In Saints, alongside Norman Reedus, they wreak havoc on the wicked. They are both perfectly cast and pull off dead-on Irish lib. Billy Connely (The Last Samurai) is a character that would make Hannibal check over his shoulder, but the difference between them is blatant and surprising.Troy Duffy, with all of his frustrations (as illustrated in a documentary that garnered more screen time than this film) has pulled off something cool and different.I don't see the Resovior Dogs comparison, which I have watched about a dozen times. I guess the Pulp Fiction comparison comes with some of the violence (Pulp's was off screen almost entirely, if you think about it) or the back-and-forth story form. A comparison to ""Frailty"" would be more accurate, but again, my opinion.Either way The Boondock Saints is not perfect, but in my adulthood there have been extremely few movies that I have watched repeatedly over a short period of time. In the past few weeks I have watches Saints 3 times, and I await to see what they do with the sequel. Sometimes imperfection's can make something even better.",4,"""We-could-kill-every-one!""

The old question comes up once more. Should  a man take the law in his hands and become judge and executor ? The answer comes easy in the film and it is yes. But then the society agrees with such a decision? According to the film YES. The complexity of the laws that the modern societies adopted to face the organized crime finally protects the criminals instead of punishing them. In the movie there is no question about what is good and what is bad. Our Heros, two brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) know what they do and they don't have any doubts about it.

582060,A52X1I4UT56KL,B00005IC54,"Amazon Customer ""debater7""","[1, 3]","Boondock Saints is an odd movie, know that going in.  It has some Tarantino-esque violence and surreal humor.  It switches between gritty realism (the brothers' apartment is painfully realistic, especially the shower) and surreal imagery imbued with a sort of psychopathic Catholic symbolism.  The cast is great, with Willem Dafoe stealing every scene he's in, as a slightly mad, flaming-gay inspector.  Later in the film, he goes undercover in drag, as possibly the strangest hooker ever.  It's also perfectly scored - the music constantly creating the right mood.The rest of the cast is great, too.  Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are good as two tough brothers in an Irish neighborhood who inadvertantly find themselves at odds with the local mafia and decide to go on a religious crusade against crime.  David Della Rocco is completely believable as their pitiful wannabe-mafioso friend who provides comic relief throughout the film.  Most of the secondary characters are memorable.  This is a huge bargain at 8 or 9 bucks if you like shoot-em-ups and over the top, bizarre humor.However, I've noticed that two groups of people seem not to enjoy the movie: people who don't like ""vigilantism"" and folks with certain strong religious ideas.  The movie, as should be clear from the reviews, is about 2 brothers whose warped interpretation of Catholicism turns them into vigilantes.  They are portrayed as the heroes and much of the story is told in a manner sympathetic to their particular, deranged worldview.  So, if you have a visceral opposition to vigilantes or religious imagery you disagree with, don't buy this film.  For me, part of what is interesting about this movie is seeing how the various dysfunctional personalities interact to convince them all that God wants them to go do some very strange things.",5,Totally worth the money if it's your kind of flick.,1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,1827,"['Boondock', 'Saints', 'odd', 'movie', 'know', 'going', 'Tarantino-esque', 'violence', 'surreal', 'humor', 'gritty', 'realism', 'brothers', 'apartment', 'painfully', 'realistic', 'especially', 'shower', 'surreal', 'imagery', 'imbued', 'sort', 'psychopathic', 'Catholic', 'symbolism', 'cast', 'great', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'stealing', 'scene', 'slightly', 'mad', 'flaming-gay', 'inspector', 'Later', 'film', 'undercover', 'drag', 'possibly', 'strangest', 'hooker', 'ever', 'also', 'perfectly', 'scored', 'music', 'constantly', 'creating', 'right', 'mood.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'too', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'are', 'good', 'two', 'tough', 'brothers', 'Irish', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'inadvertantly', 'find', 'odds', 'local', 'mafia', 'decide', 'go', 'religious', 'crusade', 'crime', 'David', 'Della', 'Rocco', 'completely', 'believable', 'pitiful', 'wannabe-mafioso', 'friend', 'who', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'Most', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', 'huge', 'bargain', '8', '9', 'bucks', 'like', 'shoot-em-ups', 'top', 'bizarre', 'humor.However', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'two', 'groups', 'people', 'seem', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'vigilantism', 'folks', 'certain', 'strong', 'religious', 'ideas', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'clear', 'reviews', '2', 'brothers', 'warped', 'interpretation', 'Catholicism', 'vigilantes', 'are', 'portrayed', 'heroes', 'much', 'story', 'told', 'manner', 'sympathetic', 'particular', 'deranged', 'worldview', 'So', 'have', 'visceral', 'opposition', 'vigilantes', 'religious', 'imagery', 'disagree', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'film', 'part', 'what', 'interesting', 'movie', 'seeing', 'how', 'various', 'dysfunctional', 'personalities', 'interact', 'convince', 'God', 'go', 'do', 'very', 'strange', 'things']",The Boondock Saints

582066,A1QG4TLIYZRL7L,B00005IC54,"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim""","[12, 39]","I must admit, I am confused.  Is this film making a statement FOR OR AGAINST self-righteous killing?  The exit-titles show people discussing, pretty much, the argument of revenge.  This is a film that shows premeditated killing, which to many people amounts to ""murder"".For instance, in the final killing in a courtroom, the scriptlines say a mafia-type godfather is about to get off, not because he's innocent (he's guilty), but because he's a CHARISMATIC mafia father, which gives the main characters in the movie a pseudo-intelligent premise to make it's statement.Two brothers go around taking revenge at criminals, disavowing the justice system, and this movie is doing what?  Does it ask if self-righteous killing is justified without a trial and without a jury?  It never forms an opinion!Personally, I will confess for the purpose of my article, I'm against capital punishment because I don't think it helps.  So, in a way, the movie actually helps my doctrine.  Most Americans approve of the death penalty by a large margin, but most of them would liberally accept and prefer an alternative when given one that works.  It's not that the film takes sides, because it doesn't; it helps my doctrine because it just shows a lot of blind, self-righteous killing that puts a bad taste in people's mouths.  This movie didn't have much depth of thought, as people who agree with the characters don't have.  The film was passed over for theatrical release.America is the only country in the civilized world, except for Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and Barbados, that still has the death penalty.  This movie shows people the opposite by so distastefully investing so much time into defining a reason to prove the killings as self-righteous indignation.  This movie does not coral support for or against.  Instead, the main characters take the law into their own hands, and then the movie leaves viewers to decipher the pieces.Not too smart of a movie, if you ask me.  Unless, it's trying to scare people into disagreeing with its characters, and it doesn't really do a good enough job.

Anyone who says it wasn't hasn't seen a comedic crime film made in the past decade.  That being said, though, Saints does tend to follow its own path.  There is far less humor, which may not have been intentional; to me, the jokes just weren't funny.  The characters are also, for the most part, far less unique and entertaining.  We learned practically nothing about any of the ""bad guys"" in the film, who ended up being nothing but cardboard cutouts.  Dialogue was also fairly weak and the acting could only be called so-so.  The character of Rocco, who would have been irritating as only a bit player, was achingly irritating as a main character.  The chemistry between the two brothers was good and the action scenes were fairly well done, but otherwsie the only saving grace for this film was Willem Defoe as the over-the-top FBI man.

The extra scenes that they put in are maybe 2 or 3 mins and when you notice it you realize that those scenes are not even violent enough to have been cut out.3. Disc 2 it's the same special features from the theatrical version. The only that made up for it a little bit is a couple of new deleted scenes.Alot of people here wrote that this lived up to there expectations but it did not live up to mine.

Maybe documentary of how this movie became such a huge hit on DVD. Cast & Crew interviews. They had  none of that they put alot of thought on this DVD but were is the love for the fans.

Thats a shame, because this first outing by director Troy Duffy is an extremely cool film that deserves all the attention it can get.Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus play two good ole Irish Catholic boys in Boston, who one day get sick of the corruption in the city and begin a bloody crusade to wipe it out. Willem DaFoe plays the FBI agent hot on their trail, who is torn between bringing the mysterious vigilantes to justice, or joining their crusade.The film is, simply put, cool. Its one of the only movies that actually make going to church look cool. Don't be fooled by the description, however; this is not an action movie. Do not expect blazing gun battles with crazy angles and MTV like editing. This is a film about morality, doing what one thinks is right, and having codes of honour. It's about all those things, and how close they may sometimes get to walking the edge between good and evil.The two actors who play the Irish vigilantes are great in their roles, playing the boys not as superheroes, but as regular joes with a huge chip on their shoulder. A nice twist in the film is DaFoe's portrayel of the FBI agent, who also happens to be gay. He plays him as a great character without being tempted to dip into stereotypes.

The Boondock Saints are a couple of demented Irish boys who dedicate their mind and spirit to the lord and also their anger and account of death as well.

So far this movie has your goons and your greeds but no action scene in this movie unwravels until (Willem Dafoe) an FBI agent comes in to investigate each of the scenes. I like how the director decided to keep the viewers in suspense waiting for the FBI agent to explain the whole scene to us! (It's kind of interesting to see) Anyways I'm for these guys all the way and the Boondock Saints is one of those movies to have in your collection to make people shut up about how THEY know all the good movies out there because there is absolutely no word of mouth on this film and I have discovered this film myself so if you read this than check the film out, I'm not saying buy it but just rent it for the pure fun and story of THE BOONDOCK SAINTS!",4,"Good movie, don't know 'bout a  cult classic though.",1053475200,"05 21, 2003",2003,1594,"[""'ve"", 'noticed', 'past', 'couple', 'action', 'movies', 'have', 'recently', 'seen', 'are', 'starting', 'spawn', 'type', 'anti-hero', 'character', 'mafia', 'drug', 'king-pins', 'corrupted', 'cops', 'are', 'victims', 'struggling', 'live', 'own', 'lives', 'simply', 'lives', 'itselves', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'are', 'ones', 'only', 'be', 'diminished', 'destroyed', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'are', 'couple', 'demented', 'Irish', 'boys', 'who', 'dedicate', 'mind', 'spirit', 'lord', 'also', 'anger', 'account', 'death', 'well', 'main', 'point', 'actions', 'feel', 'longer', 'civilized', 'chain', 'corrupted', 'leaders', 'must', 'die', 'order', 'gain', 'order', 'revolution', 'regain', 'common', 'sense', 'people', 'two', 'guys', 'kill', 'people', 'name', 'christ', 'shoot', 'someone', 'always', 'chant', 'prayer', 'side', 'side', 'together', 'So', 'far', 'movie', 'goons', 'greeds', 'action', 'scene', 'movie', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'FBI', 'agent', 'investigate', 'scenes', 'how', 'director', 'decided', 'keep', 'viewers', 'suspense', 'waiting', 'FBI', 'agent', 'explain', 'whole', 'scene', 'kind', 'interesting', 'see', 'Anyways', ""'m"", 'guys', 'way', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'one', 'movies', 'have', 'collection', 'make', 'people', 'shut', 'up', 'how', 'THEY', 'know', 'good', 'movies', 'there', 'absolutely', 'word', 'mouth', 'film', 'have', 'discovered', 'film', 'so', 'read', 'check', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'buy', 'just', 'rent', 'pure', 'fun', 'story', 'THE', 'BOONDOCK', 'SAINTS']",The Boondock Saints

582085,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005IC54,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 8]","THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is a movie with some great characters and one big plot problem.The film's premise is interesting and brings a new take on an old movie theme: vigilantism. Charles Bronson of the DEATH WISH series rules this roost, but all of these are seriously dated now. DEFIANCE (1980), starring Jan-Michael Vincent, was another great flick that focused on a citizen taking the proverbial bite out of crime in an otherwise corrupt neighborhood. So I was pleased to see something a bit fresher appear on celluloid with this oft-thought-of overused message.In The Boondock Saints we find twin brothers Connor and Murphy MacManus taking on the vigilante mantle by any bloody means necessary. And I do mean bloody. They also view themselves as instruments of God (as seen in the opening sequence in which they are in church listening to the funerary services for an innocent victim). Once on the streets, they tuck their crosses beneath their shirts and pull out their chosen weapons ...usually ones infused with gunpowder. They also say a special prayer before shooting their final bad-guy of the day, a prayer their father taught them. Oh. And their Irish, in case you didn't catch their last names. So we have to have the typical Irish pub in the area. And this is where much of the movie's success comes from. The absolutely amazing characters are what drives it.The pub owner is an old Irish coot who is being forced to sell his bar by the local Russian mob. But when the vigilante brothers show up and learn of it, they quickly make sure one of their favorite hangouts isn't manhandled by any outsiders. The Irish pub owner is thankful to the brothers, and it's amazingly funny how he thanks them because the old guy has Tourettes Syndrome (a tic disorder that often results in uncontrollable cursing outbursts).The Irish brothers also have a close friend named ""Funny Man"" Rocco (played by coked-out looking David Della Rocco) who has mob issues of his own. His ""boss"" is trying to rub him out and when Funny Man learns of it, he takes matters into his own hands as well as becoming a third party to the MaManus brothers' cause.Hot on their tails is flamboyantly gay FBI agent Paul Smecker, played by Willem Dafoe. It is Dafoe's character that really elevates The Boondock Saints to a higher level. His witty comments and astonishing detective abilities mixed with his social/sexual preferences are pulled off effortlessly. Watching him go over a crime scene while listening to opera is something to be marveled at.The downside is that this is a pretty bloody flick, spilling as much crimson as any slasher film. But the biggest issue some may have is that there's no background for the MacManus brothers. The audience never learns what trigger set them onto this path, so the viewers are just supposed to take what they're doing at face value. That's a pretty big pill to swallow. Set-up is important in the movies. But here's the thing. The Boondock Saints has such great characters, most watchers probably won't even notice this glitch.",4,It's All About The Characters...,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,3048,"['BOONDOCK', 'SAINTS', 'movie', 'great', 'characters', 'one', 'big', 'plot', 'problem.The', 'film', 'premise', 'interesting', 'new', 'take', 'old', 'movie', 'theme', 'vigilantism', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'series', 'rules', 'roost', 'are', 'seriously', 'dated', 'now', 'DEFIANCE', '1980', 'starring', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'was', 'great', 'flick', 'focused', 'citizen', 'taking', 'proverbial', 'bite', 'crime', 'otherwise', 'corrupt', 'neighborhood', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'something', 'bit', 'fresher', 'appear', 'celluloid', 'oft-thought-of', 'overused', 'message.In', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'find', 'twin', 'brothers', 'Connor', 'Murphy', 'MacManus', 'taking', 'vigilante', 'mantle', 'bloody', 'necessary', 'do', 'mean', 'bloody', 'also', 'view', 'instruments', 'God', 'seen', 'opening', 'sequence', 'are', 'church', 'listening', 'funerary', 'services', 'innocent', 'victim', 'Once', 'streets', 'tuck', 'crosses', 'beneath', 'shirts', 'pull', 'out', 'chosen', 'weapons', 'usually', 'ones', 'infused', 'gunpowder', 'also', 'say', 'special', 'prayer', 'shooting', 'final', 'bad-guy', 'day', 'prayer', 'father', 'taught', 'Oh', 'Irish', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'last', 'names', 'have', 'have', 'typical', 'Irish', 'pub', 'area', 'where', 'much', 'movie', 'success', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'it.The', 'pub', 'owner', 'old', 'Irish', 'coot', 'who', 'being', 'forced', 'sell', 'bar', 'local', 'Russian', 'mob', 'when', 'vigilante', 'brothers', 'show', 'up', 'learn', 'quickly', 'make', 'sure', 'one', 'favorite', 'hangouts', ""n't"", 'manhandled', 'outsiders', 'Irish', 'pub', 'owner', 'thankful', 'brothers', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'how', 'old', 'guy', 'Syndrome', 'tic', 'disorder', 'often', 'results', 'uncontrollable', 'cursing', 'outbursts', '.The', 'Irish', 'brothers', 'also', 'have', 'close', 'friend', 'named', 'Funny', 'Man', 'Rocco', 'played', 'coked-out', 'looking', 'David', 'Della', 'Rocco', 'who', 'mob', 'issues', 'own', 'boss', 'trying', 'rub', 'out', 'when', 'Funny', 'Man', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'as', 'well', 'becoming', 'third', 'party', 'MaManus', 'brothers', 'cause.Hot', 'tails', 'flamboyantly', 'gay', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Paul', 'Smecker', 'played', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Dafoe', 'character', 'really', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'higher', 'level', 'witty', 'comments', 'astonishing', 'detective', 'abilities', 'mixed', 'social/sexual', 'preferences', 'are', 'pulled', 'off', 'effortlessly', 'Watching', 'go', 'crime', 'scene', 'listening', 'opera', 'something', 'be', 'marveled', 'at.The', 'downside', 'pretty', 'bloody', 'flick', 'spilling', 'as', 'much', 'crimson', 'slasher', 'film', 'biggest', 'issue', 'may', 'have', 'background', 'MacManus', 'brothers', 'audience', 'never', 'what', 'trigger', 'set', 'path', 'viewers', 'are', 'just', 'supposed', 'take', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'face', 'value', 'pretty', 'big', 'pill', 'swallow', 'Set-up', 'important', 'movies', 'here', 'thing', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'such', 'great', 'characters', 'most', 'watchers', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'glitch']",The Boondock Saints

So when I saw amazon was actually selling it (WELL DONE!!!!) i decided to review it. Well I guess I should explain why I loved it:Criminally under-exposed I came across this movie by chance, Willem Defoe being a great actor persuaded me to see this movie, and oh my word.Ultra violent yet strangely moral, ultra hip, insanely funny, this movie has EVERYTHING, including a hillarious scene where one character seems to find a 1000 uses for the F-Word and a scene involving a cat - i wont give no more away because its unexpected.The McManus brothers are two Boston Irish brothers, working in a meat factory and spending their nights in a local bar.  Until the russian mob comes along and a fight breaks out, with the mob looking to take revenge on the two brothers that humiliate them, they escape with the aid of a toilet (no im not joking) and kill the two mobsters.... this sets the scene for Willem Defoe to join the movie as an FBI agent.  With the two brothers believing they are some kind of blues brothers with semi-automatics they set out under &quot;orders of god&quot; to rid society of its bad elements.  With Defoe closing in on the two and a mob-runner friend helping them out.Defoe is as ever excellent, Flannery and Reedus great as the brothers and the hillarious guy who plays Rocco looks like Mick Foley with a foul mouth.  Even Billy Connolly the great scottish  comedian, and The porn Legend Ron Jeremy have bit part roles.The soundtrack is done by Director Troy Duffy's band The Boondock Saints, and fits the story well, the action and bloodshed while excessive are stylish and some of the movie is beautifully shot, and filled if you care to notice with catholic reference and symbolism that adds explanation and believability to the plot (the tattoos on the broters hands &quot;Veritas&quot; and &quot;Aequitas&quot; means truth and justice, something very symbolic to their &quot;mission&quot;), to top it all of the dialogue is fantastic and very very funny, and the visual comedy element is just right.Tarrantino must have been gutted he didnt make this himself, but the fact that until recently hardly anyone noticed this movie, and that it never really got a proper distrobution due to contractal and production problems with Miramax is terrible.This movie should be experieced by EVERYONE, many may find it cliched or predictable or just too excessive for their tastes, but its truly a fantastic gem of a movie and I cant rate it highly enough.While I must concede it probably isnt the best movie ever made, I cant claim it to be the most original or well choreographed or whatever, what matters is that its probably my favourite, and what eventually will be remembered is how well a film is regarded not how well it was made, the success of films that were critical flops proves it, and this movie is head and shoulders above any of those.Regardless of how big or small a hit it eventually is, it will never leave my collection in any of the 3 forms I currently own it in.",5,Tarrantino WISHES he was this cool!,1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,3088,"['Ok', 'nick', 'use', 'guessed', 'probably', 'could', 'guess', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'amazon', 'was', 'actually', 'selling', 'WELL', 'DONE', 'i', 'decided', 'review', 'Well', 'guess', 'should', 'explain', 'why', 'loved', 'Criminally', 'under-exposed', 'came', 'movie', 'chance', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'being', 'great', 'actor', 'persuaded', 'see', 'movie', 'oh', 'word.Ultra', 'violent', 'yet', 'strangely', 'moral', 'ultra', 'hip', 'insanely', 'funny', 'movie', 'EVERYTHING', 'including', 'hillarious', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'character', 'find', '1000', 'uses', 'F-Word', 'scene', 'involving', 'cat', 'i', 'wont', 'give', 'more', 'away', 'unexpected.The', 'McManus', 'brothers', 'are', 'two', 'Boston', 'Irish', 'brothers', 'working', 'meat', 'factory', 'spending', 'nights', 'local', 'bar', 'russian', 'mob', 'along', 'fight', 'out', 'mob', 'looking', 'take', 'revenge', 'two', 'brothers', 'humiliate', 'escape', 'aid', 'toilet', 'im', 'not', 'joking', 'kill', 'two', 'mobsters', 'scene', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'join', 'movie', 'FBI', 'agent', 'two', 'brothers', 'believing', 'are', 'kind', 'blues', 'brothers', 'semi-automatics', 'set', 'out', 'quot', 'orders', 'god', 'quot', 'rid', 'society', 'bad', 'elements', 'Defoe', 'closing', 'two', 'mob-runner', 'friend', 'helping', 'out.Defoe', 'ever', 'excellent', 'Flannery', 'Reedus', 'great', 'brothers', 'hillarious', 'guy', 'who', 'Rocco', 'Mick', 'Foley', 'foul', 'mouth', 'Even', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'great', 'scottish', 'comedian', 'porn', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'have', 'bit', 'part', 'roles.The', 'soundtrack', 'done', 'Director', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'band', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'story', 'well', 'action', 'bloodshed', 'excessive', 'are', 'stylish', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'filled', 'care', 'notice', 'catholic', 'reference', 'symbolism', 'explanation', 'believability', 'plot', 'tattoos', 'broters', 'hands', 'quot', 'Veritas', 'quot', 'quot', 'Aequitas', 'quot', 'truth', 'justice', 'something', 'very', 'symbolic', 'quot', 'mission', 'quot', 'top', 'dialogue', 'fantastic', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'visual', 'comedy', 'element', 'just', 'right.Tarrantino', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'gutted', 'didnt', 'make', 'fact', 'recently', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'noticed', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'proper', 'distrobution', 'due', 'contractal', 'production', 'problems', 'Miramax', 'terrible.This', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'experieced', 'EVERYONE', 'many', 'may', 'find', 'cliched', 'predictable', 'just', 'too', 'excessive', 'tastes', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'gem', 'movie', 'cant', 'rate', 'highly', 'enough.While', 'must', 'concede', 'probably', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'cant', 'claim', 'be', 'most', 'original', 'well', 'choreographed', 'whatever', 'what', 'probably', 'favourite', 'what', 'eventually', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'regarded', 'not', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'made', 'success', 'films', 'were', 'critical', 'flops', 'movie', 'head', 'shoulders', 'those.Regardless', 'how', 'big', 'small', 'hit', 'eventually', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'collection', '3', 'forms', 'currently', 'own']",The Boondock Saints

It made me think of a religious version of one of the many slightly comedic mob movies like ""Snatch"". Two young Irish Catholic brothers decide that evil is rampant. When the Catholic priest tells his church about a elderly woman that was killed with people standing around doing nothing, the men decide things have gone to far. They still don't do anything until some Russian mobsters try to kick them out of a pub that belongs to a friend. Even then they just beat up the mobsters, but when the mobster break into their apartment and try to kill them they start to change. The change at first is minor but as they are supported by the City of Boston they become more bold in removing evil from the streets. Brilliant directing, good production values, and plenty of action make this well worth checking out. Willem Defoe as the gay FBI agent and Sean PAtrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the brothers are outstanding, and the rest the cast are good.

(Honestly which was ridiculous.)Moving on, my review of the movie of course is as biased as the rest. I loved it from beginning to end. It's hard to describe (in a worthwhile way) unless you see it yourself. The plot was told to me by a cousin and I really didn't want to watch it, but not even half the way through the movie I was in love with it, and bought my own copy days later.The movie itself: Two fraternal twin brothers; Connor and Murphy MacManus who somehow speak 5 languages yet work in a meat packing plant get into a barfight one night, the same men bust down their door the next morning with the intent to kill Murphy outside (who really has the 'younger' brother mentality) while Connor (obviously he's the 'older' twin) is helplessly chained inside.They -both- incidentally save each other from that predicament and later get 'baptized' and realize their calling in life is to ""Destroy all that which is evil..."", ""So all that is good may flourish."".The chemistry was amazing, with the brothers most of all. Arguably the bond Connor and Murphy shared is what made the movie stick.The movie should really be watched, anyone's reviews/comments be damned. Much, much more good has been said about it than bad and has developed a HUGE cult/word of mouth/etc. following by only coming out on video DVD and only publicly advertised when done so.You really should at one point check out the Special Features of the DVD, they will tell you a lot. Especially the 'Ma calls form Ireland' Deleted Scene. It tells you about how their father left, how the brothers are actually fraternal twins and some other facts, amusing and not.Troy Duffy's audio commentary helps out a lot. Especially to the smarks with idiotic questions that didn't watch the movie close enough. Heh. ;) He'll tell you the real meanings behind some scenes (Like the ""baptism"") and what his 'vision' was.It was a low budget movie remember so it's not like everything is perfect and all is explained and pretty like that of Armageddon and Titanic here. ~_^Overall: Great movie, solid performances, shocking/funny/dramatic all at nearly perfect times.

582116,AL9HZLZT4X1KL,B00005IC54,CV Rick,"[2, 3]","The Boondock Saints is rich with symbolism and pop culture disdain, while making a statement that things have gotten out of control with a film that got out of control.  The irony is steep, intention and not, throughout the film and the backstory.Up front and center, I liked the movie.  It ranks with the better films in a genre that arguably owes homage to Reservoir Dogs.  The Tarantino elements are rich and clear, but not ripped off - a clear distinction for me. Duffy created a wild picture full of violence, but where he parted ways with Tarantino was in the significance of life in South Boston.  These people are victimized by crime and shoddy policemanship and every day is an exercise in futility.  Duffy brings to the screen the drama that answers the question, ""what would you do about it?""The brothers, two tough Irish kids have enough when assaulted and nearly killed by pissed off Russians.  Something snaps inside them, something religious and right, something straight out of the worst war of heaven.  They take this religion and make it a religion of violence, exacting revenge against the mob for injustices done to every Irish mother and daughter, son and father, throughout blue-collar Boston.  It's not realistic, but it's realism, the dream that tough kids wanting to make a difference share throughout our violent society.Where Duffy really makes his mark, however, is in the freedom of artistic excess he portrays.  The FBI agent is gay and crossdresses.  The funny man hates his mob bosses and tells particularly unfunny jokes.  The cops are clowns, but not intentionally, it's just a system they don't think they can make a difference in.  The gags aren't funny so much as ironic, like the brothers falling through a ceiling into a mob meeting, hanging upside down accidentally tangled in ropes, yet still succeed in their mission.  Mission Impossible meets Hannah Barbara with an R-rating and blood splatter.Irish Catholicism seeps through the pours of these brothers and this film, centering on cathedrals and confessionals, and a prayer that guides their murderous ways.And shepherds we shall beFor Thee, my Lord, for TheePower hath descended forth from Thy handThat our feet may swiftly carry out Thy commandSo we shall flow a river forth to TheeAnd teeming with souls shall it ever beIn nomine Patri, et Filii, et Spiriti SanctiI only regret that Duffy destroyed the chances for this film to be legendary by biting the hand that feeds, so as to speak.

But after seeing this in store, I just had to pick it up and finally see it.The movie was pretty good. It's definitely a movie I would say fits the ""Rated M For Manly"" name, which is more or less the opposite of the term ""chick flick"". The movie isn't particularly plot heavy. All in all, it's just a movie about two brothers who, after hearing the true story of Kitty Genovese and protecting themselves and a friend in a double self-defense killing, are inspired and believe they need to fight back against hard criminals, especially organized crime types.That pretty much is the entire plot of the movie. There's no ""I want to kill the monster who murdered and raped my mother"" or ""My girlfriend has been kidnapped!"" or anything like that. Just two brothers who get tired of evil and set out to fight back. Not that i'm say this is a bad thing. Fortunately the movie is pretty enjoyable so you almost forget that it's not exactly heavy on actual plot. I'd take this over some plot-heavy movies any day.It's kind of interesting the way the narrative of the movie is told. The way the movie begins to work is that there's Scene A where the brothers are deciding to go after someone, then suddenly we see the police at the crime scene, and then FBI Agent Paul Smecker (played brilliantly by Willem Dafoe) recounts how it went down to amazingly perfect detail but we actually see what happens in flashback.The acting in the movie was great from all the main stars. I thought Willem Dafoe did great as Agent Smecker and is probably the strangest and most over-the-top fictional FBI agent I ever seen.

There's plenty of good action to be savored here, with a few wildly original payoffs and an upturned barrel full of blood'n'guts, but at heart it's an extremely simple vigilante justice story that's well-served by its hair trigger. The two leads, twin brothers who seem to have been waiting their entire lives for the excuse to go on this kind of a rampage, power through wave after wave of mafia underlings without even a whiff of danger until the closing moments. That makes for some giddy action sets early on, sure, but when the story is finally ready to slow down and say something, it's left without anything to lean on.

All human desires and actions can be boiled down to a quest to experience greater happiness, and to avoid suffering. Some of us look for happiness in the wrong places, of course. And BS shows us this, but isn't honest about the consequences. Kill and get away with it and be delighted. This is science fiction.All religions tell us that expansive feelings, thoughts, and actions increase our happiness (read: love, kindness, empathy, forgiveness, awareness of others' realities, etc.). Contractive actions (murder, revenge, anger, and so on) decrease our happiness by narrowing our awareness upon ourselves.And, well, no wonder teenage boys love BS. They haven't developed the part of their brains that is capable of understanding the long-term consequences of actions driven by negative emotions, i.e., the prefrontal cortex which doesn't fully develop until the mid-20s or later. Nor are they taught in our schools to expand their hearts to include others.So, it's no surprise that BS would be praised by 17-year-olds in a state of, let's hope, temporary sociopathy.

Practically glowing like some combination of fairy-tale and Bible story the entire film sings like a modern reading of a medieval miracle play. That it overflows with what may, on surface, appear as gratuitous violence only serves to heighten its aspects of religiosity and sense of wonder. That it is deliciously darkly comic ensures that its fun too.As the MacManus brothers, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus each bring a winning ""angels with dirty faces"" quality at once immediately endearing and disturbing in its zealousness. I could not help myself from rooting for them early on, wondering about what really led them to this mission of destruction and mayhem.Willem Dafoe gives one of his finest performances as Smecker, the brilliant, over-the-top, opera-obsessed, gay FBI agent constantly showing off his criminal knowledge as he belittles the local police trying to solve the story's problematic crimes. The slow motion scene of him ""conducting"" through a violent maelstrom of bullets as he dreamily revisits a crime scene is both breathtakingly beautiful and thigh slappingly hilarious. Some have dismissed this character (and Dafoe's performance) as obvious, when it is in all actuality, nothing less than remarkable: a complete tour-de-force by one of the best actors of this ages.Mixing hyperbole both criminal and religious with its unique brand of literalism, The Boondock Saints seems to confound and confuse as many as it delights.

Swift ""97jedi""","[1, 1]","Beginning with two young Irish men, devout Catholics both, who stand up for their rights against foreign gangsters in the streets of Boston, they quickly gain fame for standing up for the little guy against the crime and degradation taking root in the city. Believing themselves to be on a mission from God, they choose to move against other organized crime and make a difference for the innocent people in the world. As the two Irishmen, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are excellent. Their erstwhile Italian ally, for some reason portraying a character with his own name, is David Della Rocco, much more amateurish in his efforts but trying to follow their example as best he can. Perhaps his disinterest in their Catholic roots dooms him, as his solo efforts clearly lack the panache of their giving last rites to their victims. They are, after all, the Boondock Saints.Opposing them is the semi-closetbound gay FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe. His ability to recreate the scene and circumstances of the boys' actions in taking down criminals otherwise above the law is something to behold. Something of a savant, he listens to opera on headphones while examining crime scenes, his mood darkening as the killings continue and he is unable to determine the culprits. For that matter, he is not certain he wants to arrest them, since they are cleaning up the streets better than the legitimate law ever could.The second disc has the special features. There are a half-dozen or so deleted scenes, some of which are actually just extended versions of scenes that appear in the film on disc 1. There are, however, a couple of the deleted scenes that perhaps should have been added in for this unrated edition, if only to clarify as the movie progresses some of the origins of the Saints.Oddly, there are two commentaries, one by the writer/director, the other by Billy Connolly, who has about ten lines and does not even appear until near the end of the movie. Commentaries by Reedus and Flanery would have been preferable. However, that does not take away from the quality of this edition of the movie.For those who might have the VHS, this is a great replacement of the older version for those moving up to newer media.",5,"Divinely good, nice features on second disc",1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,2227,"['Beginning', 'two', 'young', 'Irish', 'men', 'devout', 'Catholics', 'who', 'stand', 'up', 'rights', 'foreign', 'gangsters', 'streets', 'Boston', 'quickly', 'gain', 'fame', 'standing', 'up', 'little', 'guy', 'crime', 'degradation', 'taking', 'root', 'city', 'Believing', 'be', 'mission', 'God', 'choose', 'move', 'other', 'organized', 'crime', 'make', 'difference', 'innocent', 'people', 'world', 'two', 'Irishmen', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'are', 'excellent', 'erstwhile', 'Italian', 'ally', 'reason', 'portraying', 'character', 'own', 'name', 'David', 'Della', 'Rocco', 'much', 'more', 'amateurish', 'efforts', 'trying', 'follow', 'example', 'can', 'Perhaps', 'disinterest', 'Catholic', 'roots', 'dooms', 'solo', 'efforts', 'clearly', 'lack', 'panache', 'giving', 'last', 'rites', 'victims', 'are', 'Boondock', 'Saints.Opposing', 'semi-closetbound', 'gay', 'FBI', 'agent', 'played', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'ability', 'recreate', 'scene', 'circumstances', 'boys', 'actions', 'taking', 'down', 'criminals', 'otherwise', 'law', 'something', 'behold', 'Something', 'savant', 'opera', 'headphones', 'examining', 'crime', 'scenes', 'mood', 'darkening', 'killings', 'continue', 'unable', 'determine', 'culprits', 'matter', 'not', 'certain', 'arrest', 'are', 'cleaning', 'up', 'streets', 'better', 'legitimate', 'law', 'ever', 'could.The', 'second', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'half-dozen', 'so', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'just', 'extended', 'versions', 'scenes', 'appear', 'film', 'disc', '1', 'are', 'however', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'unrated', 'edition', 'only', 'clarify', 'movie', 'origins', 'Saints.Oddly', 'are', 'two', 'commentaries', 'one', 'writer/director', 'other', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'who', 'about', 'ten', 'lines', 'not', 'even', 'appear', 'end', 'movie', 'Commentaries', 'Reedus', 'Flanery', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'preferable', 'However', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'quality', 'edition', 'movie.For', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'VHS', 'great', 'replacement', 'older', 'version', 'moving', 'up', 'newer', 'media']",The Boondock Saints

There are so many bad things in this movie that your head will explode with frustration. Once again, like in Quentin Tarantino movies, I never once found a hero or a character I liked. In this the two heros are irish men who decide to go on a murderous rampage killing everyone they think is evil. Now how are they heros? Why should I like them?????????????????????At the start, they appear to be strong catholics, but that can't be because I seriously can't see 2 strong catholics going on a murderous rampage killing ""evil people"". If they would be so religious, then they would leave judgement in God's hand not theirs. So that for one is completely idiotic. Secondly, the movie is idiotically unrealistic with these 2 brothers killing like 10 people. Next, there is nonstop idiotic profanity like in Tarantino movies, and I'm sorry but, f this, f that, for no apparent reason is pointless. Also, the 2 brothers are very hard to understand because of their thick accents. But, I didn't even care because all they said was the f word. Then when their friend died, I didn't give a rat's a**! He's just as bad as them. These idiotic heros created now for people to idolize are evil people. But, being the nice guy I am, I skipped to the end only to be even more outraged by what those idiotic brothers did. Quoting bible verses and executing someone in front of children and others. wth? This movie is pure trash and I find it an outrage than anyone like this filth. A movie like this one movie like Pulp Fiction, that is one of the saddest ever. Why? Because our community praises this trash and roots for 2 ""religious"" brothers killing people because they think they're evil. Whoever wrote this must be confused because someone who's actually religious would do nothing like this. And by the end of this movie, I wouldn't have cared at all if the ""heros"" would have died.Willem Dafoe does a good job as usual but his character is way too werid.

However, instead of prosecuting the shooters the police turn them lose, and instead of villifying the shooters the press condones their actions.  Enamored and emboldened, the two brothers go on a rampage of (supposed) biblical justice, killing those that they deem worthy of the ultimate punishment and sparing the innocent.As an action movie, this is solid, with good gunplay and camera angles (although I must say that I was dissapointed with a scene in which one of the brothers jumps 50 feet down and lands on a bad guy without harming himself), but the characterization and dialogue make the film soar.  Whether comparing their shoot-outs to those in popular movies to a funny dialogue about the neccessity of a rope, the script really sparkles like something of Tarantino's and keeps the viewer entertained.  In addition, the characters that proliferate the film are always interesting and original, from the flamboyantly homosexual Willem Dafoe as an FBI agent to some of the kingpins they assasinate, and look for porn star Ron Jeremy with a cameo.  7.5/10",4,What an enjoyable film,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,1375,"['Most', 'movies', 'attempt', 'survive', 'much', 'plot', 'are', 'utter', 'failures', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'great', 'action', 'wonderful', 'dialogue', 'solid', 'acting', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film.A', 'fight', 'Irish', 'bar', 'Russian', 'mafiosos', 'culimates', 'double-murder', 'alley', 'However', 'instead', 'prosecuting', 'shooters', 'police', 'turn', 'lose', 'instead', 'villifying', 'shooters', 'press', 'condones', 'actions', 'Enamored', 'emboldened', 'two', 'brothers', 'go', 'rampage', 'supposed', 'biblical', 'justice', 'killing', 'deem', 'worthy', 'ultimate', 'punishment', 'sparing', 'innocent.As', 'action', 'movie', 'solid', 'good', 'gunplay', 'camera', 'angles', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'scene', 'one', 'brothers', 'jumps', '50', 'feet', 'down', 'bad', 'guy', 'harming', 'characterization', 'dialogue', 'make', 'film', 'soar', 'Whether', 'comparing', 'shoot-outs', 'popular', 'movies', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'neccessity', 'rope', 'script', 'really', 'something', 'Tarantino', 'viewer', 'entertained', 'addition', 'characters', 'proliferate', 'film', 'are', 'always', 'interesting', 'original', 'flamboyantly', 'homosexual', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'FBI', 'agent', 'kingpins', 'assasinate', 'look', 'porn', 'star', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'cameo', '7.5/10']",The Boondock Saints

582172,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005IC54,Jason,"[4, 4]","The word legendary is not normally associated to a movie with a relatively disappointing initial release.  Word of mouth and a strong underground following, however, has turned Boondock Saints into one of the most revered and appreciated movies of all time, with a cult following large enough to elicit a sequel nearly a decade later.At its core Boondock Saints is about the classic dichotomy of good and evil.  Immersed in an overall theme of religious judgment and vindication amidst rampant organized crime in downtown Boston, two brothers - Connor and Murphy MacManus - live an ascetic lifestyle and are divinely chosen as God's avenging angels to expunge earthly evil.  Known for their brutal and grisly killings, which leave incredibly bloody crime scenes, the brothers quickly garner a citywide following akin to John Dillinger's bank robbery semi-stardom.  While the city is torn, a tense crime scene investigator Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) assists, with as many idiosyncrasies as possible, the local police force in their efforts to decelerate a suddenly explosive sequence of murdered mafia members.If a film with dozens of murders could ever be considered a ""feel good"" movie, this is it.  A liberal dosage of vigilante justice is always aided when supported by religious convictions, and the brothers - with their third-wheel, lower level Italian Mafia friend David ""The Funny Man"" Rocco - have the benefit of both.  As relayed through a confessional booth later in the movie, ""It's very easy to be sarcastic about religion, but it's much more difficult to take a stand.""  Indeed.With tense action and a score that sounds like it was created by a few Gregorian monks who were exiled in a techno club with Michael Bay, the thematic pulse of Boondock Saints holds true from beginning to end, absolute, last second end.  While a bit weak on background details, the plot stands on its own and the shootout reenactments add just enough flair and excitement to avoid condescension.I don't know if it deserves ALL the fawning and reputation, but it's a very good movie that is enjoyable on repeat viewings.Jason Elin",4,I'll have a coke,1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,2122,"['word', 'legendary', 'not', 'normally', 'associated', 'movie', 'relatively', 'disappointing', 'initial', 'release', 'Word', 'mouth', 'strong', 'underground', 'following', 'however', 'turned', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'one', 'most', 'revered', 'appreciated', 'movies', 'time', 'cult', 'following', 'large', 'enough', 'elicit', 'sequel', 'nearly', 'decade', 'core', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'classic', 'dichotomy', 'good', 'evil', 'Immersed', 'overall', 'theme', 'religious', 'judgment', 'vindication', 'amidst', 'rampant', 'organized', 'crime', 'downtown', 'Boston', 'two', 'brothers', 'Connor', 'Murphy', 'MacManus', 'live', 'ascetic', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'divinely', 'chosen', 'God', 'avenging', 'angels', 'expunge', 'earthly', 'evil', 'Known', 'brutal', 'grisly', 'killings', 'leave', 'incredibly', 'bloody', 'crime', 'scenes', 'brothers', 'quickly', 'garner', 'citywide', 'following', 'akin', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'bank', 'robbery', 'semi-stardom', 'city', 'torn', 'tense', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigator', 'Paul', 'Smecker', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'many', 'idiosyncrasies', 'possible', 'local', 'police', 'force', 'efforts', 'decelerate', 'suddenly', 'explosive', 'sequence', 'murdered', 'mafia', 'members.If', 'film', 'dozens', 'murders', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'considered', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'liberal', 'dosage', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'always', 'aided', 'when', 'supported', 'religious', 'convictions', 'brothers', 'third-wheel', 'lower', 'level', 'Italian', 'Mafia', 'friend', 'David', 'Funny', 'Man', 'Rocco', 'have', 'benefit', 'relayed', 'confessional', 'booth', 'later', 'movie', 'very', 'easy', 'be', 'sarcastic', 'religion', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'take', 'stand', 'Indeed.With', 'tense', 'action', 'score', 'was', 'created', 'few', 'Gregorian', 'monks', 'who', 'were', 'exiled', 'techno', 'club', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'thematic', 'pulse', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'true', 'beginning', 'end', 'absolute', 'last', 'second', 'end', 'bit', 'weak', 'background', 'details', 'plot', 'own', 'shootout', 'add', 'just', 'enough', 'flair', 'excitement', 'avoid', 'condescension.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fawning', 'reputation', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'repeat', 'viewings.Jason', 'Elin']",The Boondock Saints

582177,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005IC54,Jeffrey Leach,"[168, 217]","It only takes a few minutes to draw a comparison between Troy Duffy's ""The Boondock Saints"" and almost any Quentin Tarentino film. As I watched this breathtaking movie, I snickered to myself over realizing this little fact. I figured few others would make the connection. Boy, was I wrong! It seems that anyone who has seen ""Boondock Saints"" immediately thinks of ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs."" Moreover, a lot of people do not like the idea of Duffy ripping off such a noble American icon. Perhaps they have forgotten that Tarentino has based his entire career on borrowing or outright ripping off ideas from 1960s and 1970s cinema. I could care less whether Duffy imitated ""Pulp Fiction"" or whether he arrived at this idea on his own. Hollywood routinely begs, borrows, and steals in an effort to make a buck. The recent trend of remaking older films is only one aspect of this philosophy, so complaining about some filmmaker copying a specific style is a moot point. ""The Boondock Saints"" is an enormously entertaining way to spend a couple of hours and, despite a few flaws, may attain a cult status rivaling anything made by Quentin Tarentino. This is how it should be.Connor and Murphy MacManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus respectively) are two Irish brothers who spend their days drinking at the local pub and working in a local meatpacking plant. They don't do much with their free time outside of lounging around their filthy loft and hanging around with unbalanced people like their friend David Rocco, a minor criminal who longs to join the local branch of the mafia. Trouble rears its ugly head when some Russian gangsters move into the neighborhood and threaten to close down the neighborhood bar. After a fistfight leads to a couple of killings in an alley, the boys realize they may be in a spot of trouble with local law enforcement. Actually, they are in more trouble than they realize at first when an FBI agent by the name of Paul Smecker arrives on the scene. The inept local cops stand around throwing out all sorts of weird, implausible theories about these corpses in the alleyway, but Smecker moves in and figures it all out in an enormously hilarious and ingenious way. By slapping on some headphones pumping out classical music and prancing around the scene checking things out, Smecker tells the cops what happened, when it happened, and who probably did it. Sure enough, the MacManus boys sheepishly arrive at the local cop shop, bloodied and bandaged from their tussle with the Russkies, and confess to the crime.Fortunately for Connor and Murphy, Agent Smecker takes a real shine to these gregarious youngsters and releases them from jail. After all, the whole incident was merely a case of self-defense gone horribly bloody. But something strange happens to the MacManus brothers after this incident; they suddenly think they receive a calling from God to rid the streets of criminals. Checking in at the local armory of the Irish Republican Army (this is Boston, after all) and arming themselves to the teeth, Connor and Murphy use information gleaned from their encounter with the low-level mafia goons to stage a mission against the bosses of the Russian Mob. Other jobs soon follow, all apparently sanctioned and sanctified by the Almighty. The boys are so successful they soon draw in the assistance of David Rocco, who, with his vast knowledge of Boston's underworld, provides a list of criminals who deserve to die. As the body count rises, Smecker comes closer to learning the identities of these homegrown vigilantes. The fact that the FBI agent undergoes a crisis of conscience over the crimes--he quickly realizes these murders are the work of citizens fed up with crime--leads him to secretly help the men responsible for the killings. Throw in a bunch of Mafia thugs, adult film star Ron Jeremy as a doomed hoodlum, a vicious, mystical killer named ""Il Duce"" (played by Billy Connolly, still atoning for ""Head of the Class""), stylish gunplay, and an exploding cat and you have all the makings of this marvelous movie.""The Boondock Saints"" is a film about vigilantism and whether that activity is ever justifiable, although that theme seems to disappear for most of the movie. The conclusion, too, ends up being just a little too implausible, but getting there is a boatload of fun. The best things about Duffy's film are the whipsaw quick dialogue, the hilarious running gags, and Willem Dafoe as Agent Paul Smecker. Dafoe especially deserves accolades for his portrayal of a conflicted FBI agent whose sympathies eventually turn to the MacManus brothers. His way of solving crimes, especially the shootout between Il Duce and the two vigilantes, is not only brilliantly executed but a wonder to watch. Moreover, Smecker's interactions with the local Irish cops provide endless opportunities for great dialogue and hilarious jokes.Regrettably, a bit of overacting at certain points of the film quickly annoys, as does the failure to provide anything more than lip service to vigilantism and how it pertains to our ultra violent world, but ""The Boondock Saints"" is so much fun despite these flaws that you will hardly notice them. The DVD includes many extras, such as important deleted scenes, a commentary by Troy Duffy, and a widescreen presentation. There's even talk of an impending sequel, although the absence of the Willem Dafoe character, if the reports are true, could cause significant problems. There is not any other way to say it: if you have not seen ""The Boondock Saints,"" run, do not walk, to the local video store and buy or rent a copy today.",5,It's a winner,1074297600,"01 17,

582183,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B00005IC54,J. Michael,"[19, 51]","People call this movie a ""cult favorite."" That is a completely appropriate term because one really needs to be a half-lobotomized member of a cult in order to find this movie watchable. After all, this movie was only shown in 5 theaters and failed miserably after a week. The only reason it has had some success on DVD was because Blockbuster Video was conned into buying thousands of copies and had to promote it heavily as a ""Blockbuster Exclusive"" in order to recoup their losses. Like cult members, enough of the public obeyed the video store's directive, and Boondock Saints found a loyal audience among college students who find it strangely entertaining when they're high. This movie is bad...really, really bad. It defines bad. It's not even bad in a funny way, like a cheesy foreign action flick or Mystery Science Theatre 3000 selection. It's just plain unbearable. In every conceivable way it is a juvenile, amateurish, and boring failure of a movie that seems like it was written and produced by a 13 year old simpleton.The dialogue is spectacularly awful. At least 40% of it doesn't even make coherent sense in the English language, which makes me think that much of the script was written by a committee of Mexican day laborers. The other half consists of cliched action movie quips that people wouldn't actually say in real life. Maybe that's why the acting was so terrible; I think the actors obviously realized what garbage they were given to work with, so they purposely recited their lines in a very artificial, sing-songy manner, so as to convey a tacit message to the audience, like American POWs in enemy propaganda films: ""I know this movie is trash, I know this dialogue is an embarrassment to you and me, but the contracts have already been signed and I'm legally obligated to repeat the words they give me to say. However, I want you to know that my spirit hasn't been broken by my captors, so I'm going to read my lines with all the disrespect and mockery they deserve."" Someone must have had incriminating photos of William Dafoe to have coerced him into appearing in such a disaster (as a gay, cross-dressing FBI agent).The plot is as inane as all the other elements in Boondock Saints. Two seemingly ultra-pious Irish Catholics (who also associate with mobsters, blaspheme, kill and pull out guns in a Confessional) suddenly decide to start killing evil men. And that is the entirety of the plot, except for an idiotic revelation that the homicidal hit man trying to kill them is actually their father. Character development is non existent; everything about these people is one-dimensional and unmemorable. They are essentially video game characters. Everyone's motivation is either unexplained or nonsensical, and so much of this story is just riddled with holes, non-sequiturs and plain imbecility.One critic said that this movie was all about style over substance. I agree that there is no substance here, but I also don't see any style, which even a one-note hack like Tarantino has. Stylistically, this is the equivalent of a man in a brown suit with a green tie and a bad comb over. You know he'd like to be thought of as hip, but he's just not succeeding.

582191,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005IC54,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 5]","""The Boondock Saints"" is a movie that I don't even recall coming out but has somehow managed to develop an almost cult like status. And I can see why, it's definitely a very good, interesting, and original movie with some great performances. The biggest flaw with the whole movie is the final twist, which is cool but pretty unrealistic even in a movie like this. The Boondock Saints are Conner and Murphy McNamus (Sean Patrick Flannery & Norman Reedus), two Irish brothers in Boston who wind up killing two mob soldiers in self-defense. After they're cleared of any charges, they both have a vision and realize that they need to rid the world of evil. So, they begin to kill anyone who they deem evil. Meanwhile, a homosexual detective named Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe, in one of his best and oddest performances) is tracking the two ""saints"" who leave every crime scene virtually clueless. As Conner and Murphy also recruit Rocco (who's played by a guy named David Della Rocco), a mob hand; Il Duce (Billy Connolly) a psychotic killer is unleashed on them. The movie proclaims on the back cover that if you liked ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" you'll like this movie. One of those movies is my favorite movie of all time, so I guess that's true enough. But, this film isn't similar in any way to those two movies...But I do think that's a pretty good way to say it. If you liked those movies, you should like this. As an action movie, this is great...It's entertaining, there's a lot of shootouts. The way writer/director Troy Duffy directs the scenes are great. We don't see the shootout happen, but see the preparation; Then we see the cops looking the scene over, then...Flashback. The dialogue is pretty good and Dafoe's performance is perfectly over-the-top. Flannery & Reedus are perfectly cast as the two saints and Rocco doesn't miss a beat as...Rocco.GRADE: A",5,The Boondock Saints,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,1875,"['Boondock', 'Saints', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'recall', 'coming', 'out', 'somehow', 'managed', 'develop', 'almost', 'cult', 'status', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'definitely', 'very', 'good', 'interesting', 'original', 'movie', 'great', 'performances', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'whole', 'movie', 'final', 'twist', 'cool', 'pretty', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'movie', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'are', 'Conner', 'Murphy', 'McNamus', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'two', 'Irish', 'brothers', 'Boston', 'who', 'wind', 'up', 'killing', 'two', 'mob', 'soldiers', 'self-defense', ""'re"", 'cleared', 'charges', 'have', 'vision', 'realize', 'need', 'rid', 'world', 'evil', 'So', 'begin', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'deem', 'evil', 'Meanwhile', 'homosexual', 'detective', 'named', 'Paul', 'Smecker', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'one', 'best', 'oddest', 'performances', 'tracking', 'two', 'saints', 'who', 'leave', 'crime', 'scene', 'virtually', 'clueless', 'Conner', 'Murphy', 'also', 'recruit', 'Rocco', 'who', 'played', 'guy', 'named', 'David', 'Della', 'Rocco', 'mob', 'hand', 'Il', 'Duce', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'unleashed', 'movie', 'back', 'cover', 'liked', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'One', 'movies', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'guess', 'true', 'enough', 'film', ""n't"", 'similar', 'way', 'two', 'movies', 'do', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'way', 'say', 'liked', 'movies', 'should', 'like', 'action', 'movie', 'great', 'entertaining', 'lot', 'shootouts', 'way', 'writer/director', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'shootout', 'happen', 'see', 'preparation', 'Then', 'see', 'cops', 'looking', 'scene', 'then', 'Flashback', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'good', 'Dafoe', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'over-the-top', 'Flannery', 'Reedus', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'two', 'saints', 'Rocco', ""n't"", 'miss', 'beat', 'Rocco.GRADE']",The Boondock Saints

For instance, they never show the crimes as the saints commit them, they're showed as Dafoe unravels them from the crime scene.  Towards the end, in a moment of conceptual genuis, Dafoe apperes next to the saints, them actually shooting, Dafoe reinacting the scene for co workers.Boondock Saints is sure to surprise audiences at how widly well recieved it is sure to be.

Especially when you find one that is completely under the radar.  After countless times of seeing this movie on the shelf and on TV, I finally tell myself to watch it. Of course when I decide to watch it, it completely disappears from the TV stations so I have to spend a few bucks.Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus play fraternal twins Connor and McManus. While having a drink at the local bar the two and a few buddies run into some problems. Apparently, the bars owner is being forced by the Russian mob to sell the property. When the mob comes to have a chat they soon find that the brothers aren't heaving it. They ask the men to leave nicely but they refuse to go and start a fight. Next thing you know two bodies show up outback of the bar. After some thought and a few more bodies the two think of an idea. They get their guns and become vigilantes. They are going after every corrupt and villainous man in Boston.With the help of their buddy who was a package boy for the Italian mob they plan to bring down everyone. ""The Boondock saints"" is certainly not hard to throw a five star rating on. I'll get to all the good stuff first. The overall feel of the movie is amazing, the pacing and camera work are very well done. I believe the script could've been a tad bit better but it still works. Flannery and Reedus were both on point but what made the movie better was that they had a great supporting cast. William Dafoe was sick as agent Smecker and I don't think anyone else could've played him that well.The chemistry between the actors completes the film. Because they seem like they are truly these characters it gives the movie that extra bit of realness. If anything I didn't like the way some scenes were filmed. When it came time for the action scenes, the action sounds went completely away. It was replaced with music, which may be okay for some but not me. It's nothing to take a star away for but it's just my personal preference. I like the feeling and rush you get when you hear the explosions and shootouts. What more can I say?

When seen on the video shelf (which is how most people have seen it), this looked like just another fill-in, low-budget, cliche-ridden, violent, and amatuerish effort.... It is far from it.  I can't remember being more favorably impressed with a movie that I'd heard absolutely nothing about.A well-paced opening sequence introduces us to a pair of Irish brothers stuck on the low end of society.  As the story unfolds, we note the light sprinkling of religious tattoos and an unexpected fluency in a wide variety of foreign languages.  Where did these guys come from?  Why are they special?  These questions are answered slowly and fairly masterfully throughout the course of the movie.Flashbacks and double-takes on certain events are used to move the plot, thankfully without any of the self-aware empty cuteness that you see posing as creativity in a lot of movies.  After the first one, I was hooked and eagerly awaited the next.  Some may dismiss this device as a Tarantino knock-off, but I thoroughly enjoyed the way the movie handed out tidbits of information allowing us to try to keep up with what the characters on the screen were experiencing.  And I'll take a good Tarantino-esque vibe anyday.  A captivating movie.Troy Duffy is the writer/director on this grim little gem.  That saves me the trouble of figuring out which job deserves more credit for an suprisingly thrilling piece of work.Willem Dafoe gives a great performance as an experienced, eccentric Federal Agent.  You'll be adding ""-ology"" to a lot of words after this movie, and smiling about it.  Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus play the brothers.  David Della Rocca puts in a frenzied but ultimately effective performance as their low-end mobster friend.

""The Boondock Saints"", (2000), stars Norman Reedus as Murphy McManus, Sean Patrick Flannery as his brother, Connor McManus, and Willem Dafoe as Agent Smecker, the detective on their trail.  David Della Rocco plays himself and was given a co-role in the movie since he was friends with the director.  Billy Connolly from TV's ""Head of the Class"" also makes an appearance in the film as ruthless killer, ""Il Duce"", who draws the line at killing women and children but will not think twice about killing another man.Boondock Saints, Willem Dafoe, Norman Reedus, Sean Patrick Flannery""The Boondock Saints"" is a film that rose very quickly to cult status, largely because the two main characters of the film are tired of bad guys getting away with murder, (sometimes literally), and decide to take the law into their own hands to ""carry out God's work"".  Many people like to live vicariously through the two main characters, who are Irish brothers who live in Boston.  Also, stealing the show is Willem Dafoe, who is excellent as the flamboyent, gay detective who sets out with the intention to ""get these guys"", and soon realizes to his own surprise that he is largely supportive of their actions.  Smecker is excellent at explaining the crime scenes exactly how they happened and comedically mocks the inferior officers who are painted as less than intelligent.  The film follows the two brothers as they track down some of the city's worst criminals and deal them their own form of vigilante justice.  There's even a cameo in the film by adult film star Ron Jeremy, as the sidekick to a crime boss!  If you're a fan of action films with gun fight scenes, then this is your movie.  Soon, you too will be yelling, ""THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!""Talk of a sequel is in the works but if we could akin this film to previous cult movie sequels, this could very well end up being the ""Shock Treatment"" to ""The Boondock Saints'"" ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"".",5,Heaven is the Boondock Saints,1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,2046,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'action', 'violence', 'swearing', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'come', 'right', 'place', 'Boondock', 'Saints', '2000', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'Murphy', 'McManus', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'brother', 'Connor', 'McManus', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Agent', 'Smecker', 'detective', 'trail', 'David', 'Della', 'Rocco', 'was', 'given', 'co-role', 'movie', 'was', 'friends', 'director', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'TV', 'Head', 'Class', 'also', 'appearance', 'film', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'Il', 'Duce', 'who', 'line', 'killing', 'women', 'children', 'will', 'not', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'killing', 'man.Boondock', 'Saints', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'film', 'rose', 'very', 'quickly', 'cult', 'status', 'largely', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'tired', 'bad', 'guys', 'getting', 'away', 'murder', 'sometimes', 'literally', 'decide', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'carry', 'out', 'God', 'work', 'Many', 'people', 'live', 'vicariously', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'Irish', 'brothers', 'who', 'live', 'Boston', 'Also', 'stealing', 'show', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'who', 'excellent', 'flamboyent', 'gay', 'detective', 'who', 'out', 'intention', 'get', 'guys', 'soon', 'realizes', 'own', 'surprise', 'largely', 'supportive', 'actions', 'Smecker', 'excellent', 'explaining', 'crime', 'scenes', 'exactly', 'how', 'happened', 'comedically', 'inferior', 'officers', 'who', 'are', 'painted', 'less', 'intelligent', 'film', 'two', 'brothers', 'track', 'down', 'city', 'worst', 'criminals', 'deal', 'own', 'form', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'even', 'cameo', 'film', 'adult', 'film', 'star', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'sidekick', 'crime', 'boss', ""'re"", 'fan', 'action', 'films', 'gun', 'fight', 'scenes', 'then', 'movie', 'Soon', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'yelling', 'THERE', 'WAS', 'A', 'FIREFIGHT', 'Talk', 'sequel', 'works', 'could', 'akin', 'film', 'previous', 'cult', 'movie', 'sequels', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'Shock', 'Treatment', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show']",The Boondock Saints

This happened to me several times while watching BOONDOCK SAINTS. It is an overwhelming tour de force.In today's world of moral relativism, nihilism, and hedonism, BOONDOCK SAINTS is an extremely refreshing change. It chronicles the lives of two Irish brothers in Boston who have been charged by God to cleanse the city of evil men, and the savvy and worldly FBI agent on their case. It is the story of real men, men who plant their sword in the ground and would die for the cause in which they believe. Some might call this dangerous fanaticism. They just might be right. The beauty of this film is that, in the spirit of intellectual honesty, it even questions its heroes. This fact is another refreshing change from standard Hollywood films in which the ""good"" guy kills a bunch of people, gets the girl, and no one asks any questions.Stylistically, freshman Troy Duffy attempts to imitate Guy Ritchie. Even the box says ""in the tradition of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels."" Yet Duffy fails in this regard on two counts. First, he isn't nearly as stylish as Ritchie; and second, he is far better than him. Whereas Ritchie's films are mostly enjoyable, but essentially empty, Duffy's BOONDOCK SAINTS tackles very serious intellectual and spiritual issues in a very satisfying manner. Please watch this great work. It will move and stimulate you.

Believing that they are charged by God to kill evil people, they arm up and begin a vigilante killing spree.  Tracked by a rather bizarre FBI agent (Defoe) they hook up with their Italian friend (Rocco) and create havoc.  Before the end, the FBI agent struggles with the conflict of his job to stop them and the fact that are ridding society of 'scum'.This movie really does have the feel of Tarentino films, especially Pulp Fiction.  But is it as good?  I'd say not.  While there are some interesting and sometime shocking (ref the exploding cat and Defoe's lip-lock with the Russian thug) moments, this does not maintain the level of interest that Pulp Fiction does.  Rocco's character was a distraction to the brothers as well as the audience.  I found that the endless stream of f*** became tedious, disingenuous and tiring.  Without Defoe's excellent performance, this movie would have really dragged.Also, the preachy ending was a bit of a letdown to me.  It was out of step with the mask-wearing brothers from earlier in the movie.  And were the TV interviews at the end an attempt to claim that this movie was a serious look at the issue of vigilantism?

Two Catholic brothers become cult heroes after they kill Russian mafia hoods in self defense; they feel now they are on a mission from God to rid Boston of all the lowlife, and do so quite violently, with no real ""list"" to go by; just the nasties.  Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus give energetic, fine tuned performances as the brother; David Del Rocco as their buddy Rocco (he used his real name since Duffy wrote the part for him) is a little over the top but one can't deny his commitment to the role.  But it's the versatile Willem Dafoe who carries the picture with his role as the flamboyant and openly homosexual FBI agent Smecker.  Smecker listens to opera while investigating crime scenes; he goes to gay bars; he is manic, obsessive, but obviously brilliant.  His scenes are electrically charged and dynamic.  While vigilante justice is a matter of opinion, one does find they are almost cheering these guys on in their quest for retribution when the system fails.  Duffy keeps things moving well; be warned if you find the F word offensive though.  According to the IMDB, the F word and its derivatives are used a mind-boggling 246 times.

Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[1, 1]","Irish bothers Connor and Murphy (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) get an epiphany after killing in self defense....God wants them to rid the world of evil. So, using guns and religion as weapons, they systematically wage a war on those in society who use and abuse those considered weak. Why not start with the mobsters who control the city and brutalize those who stand in their way.  Realizing that there is more to these deaths that meet the eye, a somewhat unconventional FBI Agent Paul Smecker (William Defoe) arrives on the scene with headphones (he listens to opera) and a dedication to catching these vigilantes, although he secretly desires to join the duo. Running from some who want to kill them, while trying to rid the world of those deemed less desirable, Connor and Murphy meet their match in a gray haired killer released to catch them. As the story unravels, there are gun fights, comedic bantering, but most of all there is a sense that these two Irish brothers are doing the very things that people desire to do themselves. Handing out justice...being the judge, the jury and the executioner appeals to most, even an FBI Agent whose hands are tied usually by the law. So while their methods may appear to be brutal, we justify the actions and find some sense of hope that there are still those that stand for what is right. They are doing what we have all longed to do and one point or another. And although we could debate is doing the wrong thing for the right reasons justify their actions (i.e., breaking the law...murder is murder), it was great just seeing two people take a stand for something that they believe in and this is what made this storyline so endearing.This movie had everything that made it great......there is comedy, violence,  creative twists, and great acting that only a truly brilliant and creative director could bring to life. My first thought was that this movie could have been directed by Tarentino (who I absolutely love) and I know that I will not be the last person to say that after seeing both of their works. In short, Duffy's ""Boondock Saints"" had the same atmosphere and edgy wit and humor that a Tarentino flick would have, only better!Anyway, I had never heard of this movie before, but picked it up on the chance that it would be somewhat entertaining.

However, thou shall not kill is the only commandment that they cannot keep. When a sadistic Russian mob starts to force its way into their South Irish Boston neighborhood, they know what they have to do. They set out to rid the streets of every gangster, criminal, and lowlife. In their eyes they are serving God's vengenance. As the bodycount rises, they become local heroes to the world around them. Paul Smecker( Willem Dafoe) is a gay FBI agent who is assigned to the case. While he agrees with the McManus brothers are doing, Paul is forced to do his job. He must now use his extremely unorthodox and brilliant methods of investigation to bring the Mcmanus brothers down.Before I watched this film, I was very skeptical because the movie came straight to video. However, ""Boondock Saints"" turned out to be one of the best films I have ever seen. If I had to describe the film, I would classify it as a modern day morality tale that is driven by vengenance and determination. The film features an outstanding mix of comedy and intense action. There are moments in the film when you will be laughing your head off. The dialogue in this film is first rate. There are other moments in the film however, where you will be shocked at the countless violence. The shoot out scenes are extremely well done. Perhaps one of the best things about the film, is the creativity that the McManus brothers use for some of their kills. The performances given in this film are suprisingly good!! Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus are outstanding as the McManus brothers. However, the best performance of the movie hands down goes to Willem Dafoe as Paul Smecker. It is the best performance of his career in my opinion. Watching Paul work is very entertaining. His methods are unorthodox, intelligent, and entertaining!Overall, ""Boondock Saints"" is a great film. It features an excellent mix of comedy and action, the gunplay in this film is first rate, and the performances given from the actors involved could not have been better.

Action, adventure, black comedy, bitter, lovely, and haunting.  The characters and dialogue hit you with the force of a nuclear blast.  You are immediately sucked into their universe and you never want to leave it.  They are Everyman and no man at the same time.  The writing is first rate, the acting is absolutely delicious.  What entrancing rogues they are.  Did I love them? And how!  Flanery and Reedus are delightful and well cast as the brothers; David Della Rocco is absolutely brilliant as the engaging half wit, Rocco.  I don't know anyone other than my children, and a few of their friends, who have seen it.  Age doesn't matter with this film, as it does with some indies.  My kids are twenty something, and I am considerably older!  But we all loved it.  Dafoe does a stellar turn as a gay FBI agent.  I could go on and on.  Wish I could remember everyone's names, but I can't.  Suffice it to say, that the actors playing the detectives are very good as well.  And Billy Connelly is fabulous as the brother's psychopathic father.  Ah, you knew they had to get it somewhere, didn't you?  Do yourself a favor, and buy this movie.  I have seen it probably 50 times or more since owning it.  It's a real treasure: take it out and savor it often.  5 stars out of 5, but worth a constellation.

I think this movie kinda got lost in the shuffle at the time of release because ""Suicide Kings"" came out about the same time and was also a great film which may have caused allot of people who are lesser fans of this genre to think they already saw it.  (spoilers) What makes this movie is Dafoe's performance.  He is GREAT in this flick.  Allot of people mention that they felt it was a pulp fiction knock off and there are definately certain scenes (like the cat getting shot) where you can see its influence but over all i think its stands on its own fine because of agent Smecker (Dafoe).  He has to be one of the most wildly entertaining charecters ive seen in years.  I would have given this movie 5 stars but the religous crap gets annoying and the ending was kinda weak.

In fact, maybe not Tarantino - this film actually comes closer to an American version of Guy Ritchie's films than any other American movie I have seen.It's great fun on one level, disturbing on another, with religious overtones so strong that no Catholic church allowed the movie to film its sanctuary.  It will even get you talking about the idea of vigilantism - good thing or bad - how far is too far?Plot has been elaborated on elsewhere, but basically two brothers who work in a meat factory in Boston get into a fight at their bar which results in the deaths of two `bad guy' Russians.  This empowers them to feel they are on a mission from God to cleanse the world of `bad guys'.  Meanwhile, Willem Defoe plays a gay FBI genius on their trail - his portrayal of a man almost over the edge in various ways, is a real highlight.Music is great, with thumping soundtrack and choral music making an unlikely but oddly effective combination - and the photography belies the low budget and short shoot (just 32 days).

582269,A3I9LMORUC5GAV,B00005IC54,"Norman I. Buchwald ""waldnorm""","[7, 19]","I finally got to see this little-known movie, and it's really a B movie that has some ""art house"" characteristics.  It has strengths in some of its style, the choice of omission of scenes that were not needed as they fill the picture, and an interesting technique where the mixing of DaFoe's characters interpretations of the murder scene and what actually happened-- but unlike say traditional Quentin Tarantino films which this movie is supposed to emulate, it does not have enough to simply be about style-- and its message is far too simplistic.  I mean the movie simply takes the notion of righteous, heroic vigilantes and elevates them almost to martyrhood.  The problem is there's not much substance to the characters-- even DaFoe's gay investigator comes off disappointing.  And there are elements of the movie that it hardly probes but simply teases, i.e. one racial/ethnic faction against another-- in this case Irish poor against the Russian mafia-- for all the ""heroic"" elevations these characters may seem to get, they are after only one type of villain/mobster creating crime in the streets.  Then there may even be the possibility that this movie is about manhood/machoism-- I mean DaFoe's character brushes off one of his boyfriends because he is too [openly gay]  for him.The fantasy of the two Irish brothers succeeding in their efforts to off the Russian mobsters goes beyond realistic expectations, yet in spite of the experimental nature of the film, seems to insist we are in the ""real world"" here.  And finally, its ending where the media interviews people off the street to ask their opinion of whether our two Irish brothers are heroes or criminals seems silly, since the movie seemed to make them seem heroes throughout (even DaFoe's character seems to be won over them way too easily).  So this movie finally lacks a conflict, and as strange as it is to see the two Irish brothers make their offing bad guys a religious ritual, unintentionally makes the audience respond negatively in a post September 11 world (Note: Movie was made two years before 9/11).Two stars for some style, but as for its substance-- we're talking total B-movie territory, maybe even weaker.  There's no story here.  Just episodic ventures of our heroes (and not even anti-heroes) fighting the Russian mob because they've hurt their turf way too often. They may wear black trenchcoats, but they are actually wearing white hats in your typical weak white hats/black hats plot.  Now I finally understand why Sundance, the Independent Film Channel and the regular cable channels did not pick up this movie for so long.  There's not much there.  Two stars because I still see some promising for filming and production for other types of movies.  It at least has some interesting ideas/approaches to film making.",2,Weak White Hats/Black Hats Story/Conflict,1040428800,"12 21, 2002",2002,2809,"['finally', 'got', 'see', 'little-known', 'movie', 'really', 'B', 'movie', 'art', 'house', 'characteristics', 'strengths', 'style', 'choice', 'omission', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'needed', 'fill', 'picture', 'interesting', 'technique', 'where', 'mixing', 'DaFoe', 'characters', 'interpretations', 'murder', 'scene', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'say', 'traditional', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'films', 'movie', 'supposed', 'emulate', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'simply', 'be', 'style', 'message', 'far', 'too', 'simplistic', 'mean', 'movie', 'simply', 'notion', 'righteous', 'heroic', 'vigilantes', 'almost', 'martyrhood', 'problem', 'not', 'much', 'substance', 'characters', 'even', 'DaFoe', 'gay', 'investigator', 'off', 'disappointing', 'are', 'elements', 'movie', 'hardly', 'simply', 'teases', 'i.e', 'one', 'racial/ethnic', 'faction', 'case', 'Irish', 'poor', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'heroic', 'elevations', 'characters', 'may', 'seem', 'get', 'are', 'only', 'one', 'type', 'villain/mobster', 'creating', 'crime', 'streets', 'Then', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'possibility', 'movie', 'manhood/machoism', 'mean', 'DaFoe', 'character', 'brushes', 'one', 'boyfriends', 'too', '[', 'openly', 'gay', ']', 'him.The', 'fantasy', 'two', 'Irish', 'brothers', 'succeeding', 'efforts', 'off', 'Russian', 'mobsters', 'realistic', 'expectations', 'yet', 'spite', 'experimental', 'nature', 'film', 'insist', 'are', 'real', 'world', 'here', 'finally', 'ending', 'where', 'media', 'interviews', 'people', 'street', 'ask', 'opinion', 'two', 'Irish', 'brothers', 'are', 'heroes', 'criminals', 'silly', 'movie', 'seemed', 'make', 'seem', 'heroes', 'even', 'DaFoe', 'character', 'be', 'won', 'way', 'too', 'easily', 'movie', 'finally', 'conflict', 'as', 'strange', 'see', 'two', 'Irish', 'brothers', 'make', 'offing', 'bad', 'religious', 'ritual', 'unintentionally', 'audience', 'respond', 'negatively', 'post', 'September', '11', 'world', 'Note', 'Movie', 'was', 'made', 'two', 'years', '9/11', '.Two', 'stars', 'style', 'substance', ""'re"", 'talking', 'total', 'B-movie', 'territory', 'maybe', 'even', 'weaker', 'story', 'here', 'Just', 'episodic', 'ventures', 'heroes', 'not', 'even', 'anti-heroes', 'fighting', 'Russian', 'mob', ""'ve"", 'hurt', 'turf', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'may', 'wear', 'black', 'trenchcoats', 'are', 'actually', 'wearing', 'white', 'hats', 'typical', 'weak', 'white', 'hats/black', 'hats', 'plot', 'Now', 'finally', 'understand', 'why', 'Sundance', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Channel', 'regular', 'cable', 'channels', 'did', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'so', 'long', 'not', 'much', 'there', 'Two', 'stars', 'still', 'see', 'promising', 'filming', 'production', 'other', 'types', 'movies', 'least', 'interesting', 'ideas/approaches', 'film', 'making']",The Boondock Saints
582270,A11B6LNU5MS6V,B00005IC54,N. Sturm,"[0, 0]","Critics panned this movie, and I'm not really sure why.  They seem to agree that it's more interested in gory images than in depth or insight, and some feel it's a Tarantino ripoff (as he's the king of shallow, gratuitous violence).  I didn't get that.  I'll admit the tone is uneven--cauterizing one's wounds is almost unendurable agony, but lighting a man on fire is funny?-- and though nobody likes endless exposition this might be a rare case of too much show, not enough tell.  If my brother and I received a sign that we should go shoot bad guys, I think we'd discuss it a bit.  As it is, we have little to no sense of the characters' real thoughts about what they do.That said, I don't think that TBS is ""so gleeful in its endorsement of vigilante justice"" that it's almost to self-parody, as a reviewer for the AV Club opined.  I'm not saying this film handles the issue as maturely as, say, The Dark Knight does; however, the interviews at the end are clearly meant to provoke some sort of discussion.  I think the film makes a decent point when the brothers describe a typical person's ""just shoot `em all"" reaction to seeing criminals get away.  Is that really what most people want to see happen?  Toby Keith has a song called ""Beer for my Horses"" on exactly that topic.  I call it the lynch mob song and it was one of his biggest hits.  Lots of critics like Dexter and it's about a man who kills those whom the law doesn't get.  I just feel like I don't get where the line is drawn.Regardless of moral questions, TBS is bound to be successful with some because it utilizes a winning formula: brothers who fight crime and say prayers before they kill.  Unless it's grossly mishandled, what isn't cool about that?  Paul Smecker is an unusual case of a character being gay for no obvious reason, and as far as I can tell convinced a majority of the male audience that gay can be bad*ss.  So that's nice. Though I enjoy watching the interaction between the characters, I can't for the life of me figure out why the brothers are so attached to Rocco,and having Il Duce turn out to be their father seems kind of dumb and out of nowhere.  Still, it's an overall decent film that I think greatly appeals to the wanna-be superhero in a lot of men.  7/10",3,It's pretty okay.,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,2257,"['Critics', 'panned', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'seem', 'agree', 'more', 'interested', 'gory', 'images', 'depth', 'insight', 'feel', 'Tarantino', 'ripoff', 'king', 'shallow', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'tone', 'uneven', 'cauterizing', 'one', 'wounds', 'almost', 'unendurable', 'agony', 'lighting', 'man', 'fire', 'funny', 'nobody', 'endless', 'exposition', 'might', 'be', 'rare', 'case', 'too', 'much', 'show', 'not', 'enough', 'tell', 'brother', 'received', 'sign', 'should', 'go', 'shoot', 'bad', 'guys', 'think', ""'d"", 'discuss', 'bit', 'have', 'little', 'sense', 'characters', 'real', 'thoughts', 'what', 'do.That', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'TBS', 'so', 'gleeful', 'endorsement', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'almost', 'self-parody', 'reviewer', 'AV', 'Club', 'opined', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'issue', 'as', 'maturely', 'say', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'however', 'interviews', 'end', 'are', 'clearly', 'meant', 'provoke', 'sort', 'discussion', 'think', 'film', 'decent', 'point', 'when', 'brothers', 'describe', 'typical', 'person', 'just', 'shoot', 'em', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'criminals', 'get', 'away', 'really', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'happen', 'Toby', 'Keith', 'song', 'called', 'Beer', 'Horses', 'exactly', 'topic', 'call', 'lynch', 'mob', 'song', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'hits', 'Lots', 'critics', 'Dexter', 'man', 'who', 'whom', 'law', ""n't"", 'get', 'just', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'where', 'line', 'drawn.Regardless', 'moral', 'questions', 'TBS', 'bound', 'be', 'successful', 'winning', 'formula', 'brothers', 'who', 'fight', 'crime', 'say', 'prayers', 'kill', 'grossly', 'mishandled', 'what', ""n't"", 'cool', 'Paul', 'Smecker', 'unusual', 'case', 'character', 'being', 'gay', 'obvious', 'reason', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'convinced', 'majority', 'male', 'audience', 'gay', 'can', 'be', 'bad*ss', 'nice', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'interaction', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'brothers', 'are', 'so', 'attached', 'Rocco', 'having', 'Il', 'Duce', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'father', 'kind', 'dumb', 'nowhere', 'Still', 'overall', 'decent', 'film', 'think', 'greatly', 'appeals', 'wanna-be', 'superhero', 'lot', 'men', '7/10']",The Boondock Saints

582284,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B00005IC54,Poor Napoleon,"[2, 2]","""The Boondock Saints"" is probably the first violent, stylized, kill-em-all film that I would describe as a ""feel good"" movie.  That this film has achieved such cult status is a combination of the film's stylized direction and dialogue, and the idea of a couple of regular guys enforcing their brand of justice on all these bad guys.  Let's face it.  If you had the opportunity and the lack of inhibitions, wouldn't you do what these guys do?The film has been panned by many top critics for it's highly derivitive style.  True, the bible passage shouting before you kill a guy has been done by Tarantino.  True also is that the idea of the detective listening to opera while investigating seems to borrow a bit from John Woo (as well as some of the action scenes), but the fun here is that Troy Duffy and co don't take any of it seriously.  The brothers are a fun duo.  But it's Willem Dafoe who steals the show.Willem Dafoe plays cross dressing gay FBI agent Paul Smecker, who is probably the most original character Duffy has crafted for the film.  He has the best lines.  Dafoe plays the character so straight (and I use the term loosely) that he's made this character.  He plays Smecker as very proficient, but with a lot of quirks.Since Tarantino, there's been a lot a lot of so called derivative films that critics have had a lot of disdain for.  Boondock Saints is one of those films.  While the dialogue and style doesn't rise to Tarantino levels, it's still good in its own right.  And it's not a blatant rip off, though it'd be tough to say those films didn't inspire how this picture is shot.  There are some non linear sequences, but they have their own unique flare.  Duffy shows us a scene and uses Smecker to go back and see what happened.Boondock Saints is a fun film.  There's reasons to see how it has reached cult status.  While it's not one of the best films ever made, it does leave you with a certain feeling.  Our heroes are likeable and we're cheering them on throughout the film.  In some ways, it has the flare of a crazed underground vigilante superhero film, complete with larger than life characters.

Unfortunately, the mass appealof this movie simply is not there, as this work is a lot like FIGHT CLUB,in that there is a demented story, totally disconnected from reality,illogical,  and very niche-minded in terms of the movie fan base whowill want to see this work again.First, the entertainment aspect is questionable, for various reasons;the foremost one being, the blood packs going off on a regular basis,every 5 minutes, in various environments across Boston, every singletime with a Matrix-inspired slow motion of bullets, glass flying everywhere,with the dynamic duo spewing bullets with semi-automatic weapons as ifthere was an unlimited magazine of bullets in each pistol.Secondly, there is an offensive suggestion that righteousness, vigilantism,and the practice of  reciting prayers and familiarity with religious chants isthe one and the same with a  need for mass murder and lack of forgivenessin others; the offenders cannot see past their noses or their own misgivings anddefects - which is not found in any religious teaching in Christianity,except perhaps the one spoken about in this movie.Third, there is a confusing interplay of the historical Boston,  theIrish Boston of the 1800's, the pubs, of St. Patrick's Day with modern-dayBoston, and the Russian mob, in the post- Berlin era with former KBG andsoviet Union military retrained as mobsters to enforce the dreams of  realestate speculators buying out properties in the USA for large scale projects.Needless to say, the cursing and swearing seems futile in many cases, ordisplaced to say the least ...Law enforcement is not presented almost at all, or  accurately at thatwhich is sorely confirmed over the entire picture.The redeeming qualities of this picture (which unfortunately, fails tocarry the viewers in another time and space ...but rather, just makesthem frown time and again, in between hopes of the picture picking up,making more sense, and getting morem - mature,  doesn't happen) is Defoe,playing a bisexual FBI detective, who investigates the vigilantismoccurring, and who at length, is torn between his own beliefs about theneed to clean up ruthlessly the underworld as it touches upon the majorityof the population who live their own lives in normalcy, versus his obligationas a peace officer to investigate those who pulled the trigger,  gatherevidence, and place them behind bars. His acting is vivid, fresh, articulate,convincing, sincere, professional ...with some funny moments as the paradoxof his sexuality is exposed in his own attitudes and behavior.The  filming  and editing of this  movie is flawless, but with a morecomplex, ambigious strategy as far as the soundtrack goes, from the eclecticchoices, ranging from Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, to Matrix-style synthpop in the action scenes, etc.The film makers juxtapose  mind-numbing bloodbaths occurring time and again,with Operatic and Church chants,  suggesting that, those committing violenceand deeds completely out of the bounds of the imagination, did lose touchwith their own humanity,  feelings,  rapport with society and their lovedones, entering the realm of insanity, of course. One learns early that whenpain ceases to be felt, the body is vulnerable to maximum damage in riskyenvironments.Overall, the potential of this work is almost entirely wasted, as it almostseems inspired by  FIGHT CLUB 3 years after the fact, in terms ofits unrealism, and admiration for when a man surrenders his own humanityand goes insane, through ultra-violence.

If such a senario could even be possible it shouldn't be any suprise to those who have seen this film for me to say something like that. At first I pretty much couldn't stand this film, but numerous aspects about it won me over.... sort of. Firstly the acting by the entire cast was absolutely brilliant. Willem Dafoe was so good in this he pretty much deserved an Oscar for his performance. He's that good as the quirky FBI agent who's gay but hates homosexuals. I also loved the originality of this film. What I didn't like so much was the annoying metal style music soundtrack. I couldn't stand that, and I pretty much didn't care for some of the characters who were extremely animated. Somehow I pretty much hated the way the characters were so over the top, and it annoyed me. I agree that this film isn't for everyone. It's part black comedy, part vigilante fantasy with a lot of yelling and cussing that sometimes was so extreme it gave me a first class headache. But you have give credit where credit is due. Where else but a wierd movie like this would you find Willen Dafoe, Ron Jeremy, and the guy that played Morris O'Brian from the series 24(as a mob boss no less) in the same film?

Saturday Night Live depicts a bad Irish tradition of getting angry for no good reason, and the real world depicts the Irish as being a bunch of drunks. This film doesn't help the image of the Irish.The Boondock Saints certainly isn't a normal mobster movie by any means. I like to interpret it as a satire of religion. The first 40 or so minutes of this movie are really outstanding, and then it just sort of collapses. It's not a bad movie, but I heard numerous five star reviews for it from people I've talked to, and that's going a little crazy. There are two Irish mobsters, who believe in the Catholic faith and they go around wrecking people who they feel are a detriment to society in Boston, while believing that they aren't doing anything against the morals of Catholicism. There's a homosexual FBI agent who knows what they're doing and condones it, because he believes it is only benefitting society. In the words of the film, he believes that he is giving the two mobsters a duty as god, so to speak. After a while, when the movie loses its grip, a long-haired Italian guy joins them as an accomplice. The Boondock Saints came out in 2000 and has been established as a popular cult film in this era, like St. Elmo's Fire was in the mid-1980's. It does have a lot of style, and it needed too, with mobsters that young. The only major complaint I have is the language.

582291,A1POMPC5RSXA73,B00005IC54,resident_out_of_touch,"[2, 4]","I saw this movie recently without knowing much about it, besides lots of reccomendations from fellow movie geeks. I was more or less expecting a Tarantino-esque crime movie with some wierdass characters and lots of cursing, which is more or less what I got. I love some good madcap action, and there is plenty of that, from Sean Flannery uprooting a toilet and then jumping off a roof to Norman Reedus pulling wine bottles from behind him and smashing them on the head of an assailant. This is entertaining on its own merits, and would have been even better had the two brothers been fleshed out a bit more as characters. They are introduced fairly sketchily as charismatic drinking buddies, carefree yet dedicated, one half townie jokers and one half able fighters and hitmen. A pretty common idea in the movies, that could've been taken a lot farther.Willem Dafoe makes up for this however, by turning in a completely surprising show-stealing performance as a gay FBI agent. While the brothers handle the action and posturing, Dafoe provides exactly the sort of masterful character acting that makes this genre of film. Sam Jackson (well, the whole cast in actuality) did the same in Pulp Fiction, Sam Rockwell did it in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Joe Pesci did it in Goodfellas. These vicariously violent movies transcend being simple thrillers by providing addictive performances by actors who seem to effortlessly embody their characters.The other characteristic of this genre is the production, and true to form Troy Duffy uses the camera quite well to make his scenes not just entertaining because of the action but also effective visually. One shot that stuck with me was the hilarious cut to a whimsical overhead shot of Willem Dafoe reclining on a feather bed and fiddling with a purple boa as he theorizes about a crime scene. These little touches make the whole affair decidedly stylized; larger-than-life characters, comic book action, and tricky camera work all come together to produce the genre of stylish, darkly comical crime thrillers.My biggest complaint is that the plot moves very awkwardly at times. Things seem to happen too fast, drama seems to rise without proper buildup etc. Once the plot is in full gear, the brothers have less and less opportunities to provide interesting dialogue, and ultimately I found myself waiting through uninteresting plot exposition scenes for the next shootout or Willem Dafoe scene. I imagine that the vigilante message of the film was foremost in the filmmakers' minds, which led them to focus on pushing the plot to its final denouement, instead of lingering on character performances and transitional scenes. This isn't a bad notion in and of itself, but it seemed to come off a little rushed. I would've preferred either a longer film with a more fleshed out progression of events, or a more Tarantino/Scorcese-esque approach giving the actors more time to indulge us with their characters peculiarities.Still a great film however, with a lot of funny moments to keep things from getting too dark. A lot of scenes end with unexpected little gags, and there is plenty of off-kilter goofiness in the middle of otherwise gruesome and serious scenes, like Rocco groping the passed-out stripper after blowing away a mafia underboss. Good film, but it's not quite Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas.",4,"Lot of fun, a little awkwardly plotted",1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,3353,"['saw', 'movie', 'recently', 'knowing', 'much', 'lots', 'reccomendations', 'fellow', 'movie', 'geeks', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'expecting', 'Tarantino-esque', 'crime', 'movie', 'wierdass', 'characters', 'lots', 'cursing', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'got', 'love', 'good', 'madcap', 'action', 'plenty', 'Sean', 'Flannery', 'uprooting', 'toilet', 'then', 'jumping', 'off', 'roof', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'pulling', 'wine', 'bottles', 'smashing', 'head', 'assailant', 'entertaining', 'own', 'merits', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'had', 'two', 'brothers', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'fairly', 'sketchily', 'charismatic', 'drinking', 'buddies', 'carefree', 'yet', 'dedicated', 'one', 'half', 'townie', 'jokers', 'one', 'half', 'able', 'fighters', 'hitmen', 'pretty', 'common', 'idea', 'movies', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taken', 'lot', 'farther.Willem', 'Dafoe', 'up', 'however', 'turning', 'completely', 'surprising', 'show-stealing', 'performance', 'gay', 'FBI', 'agent', 'brothers', 'handle', 'action', 'posturing', 'Dafoe', 'exactly', 'sort', 'masterful', 'character', 'acting', 'genre', 'film', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'well', 'whole', 'cast', 'actuality', 'did', 'same', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'did', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'did', 'Goodfellas', 'vicariously', 'violent', 'movies', 'transcend', 'being', 'simple', 'thrillers', 'providing', 'addictive', 'performances', 'actors', 'who', 'seem', 'effortlessly', 'embody', 'characters.The', 'other', 'characteristic', 'genre', 'production', 'true', 'form', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'camera', 'quite', 'well', 'make', 'scenes', 'not', 'just', 'entertaining', 'action', 'also', 'effective', 'visually', 'One', 'shot', 'was', 'hilarious', 'cut', 'whimsical', 'overhead', 'shot', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'reclining', 'feather', 'bed', 'fiddling', 'purple', 'boa', 'crime', 'scene', 'little', 'touches', 'make', 'whole', 'affair', 'decidedly', 'stylized', 'larger-than-life', 'characters', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'tricky', 'camera', 'work', 'come', 'together', 'produce', 'genre', 'stylish', 'darkly', 'comical', 'crime', 'thrillers.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'plot', 'very', 'awkwardly', 'times', 'Things', 'seem', 'happen', 'too', 'fast', 'drama', 'rise', 'proper', 'buildup', 'etc', 'plot', 'full', 'gear', 'brothers', 'have', 'less', 'less', 'opportunities', 'provide', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'ultimately', 'found', 'waiting', 'uninteresting', 'plot', 'exposition', 'scenes', 'next', 'shootout', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'scene', 'imagine', 'vigilante', 'message', 'film', 'was', 'foremost', 'filmmakers', 'minds', 'led', 'focus', 'pushing', 'plot', 'final', 'denouement', 'instead', 'lingering', 'character', 'performances', 'transitional', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'bad', 'notion', 'seemed', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'rushed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'longer', 'film', 'more', 'fleshed', 'progression', 'events', 'more', 'Tarantino/Scorcese-esque', 'approach', 'giving', 'actors', 'more', 'time', 'indulge', 'characters', 'peculiarities.Still', 'great', 'film', 'however', 'lot', 'funny', 'moments', 'keep', 'things', 'getting', 'too', 'dark', 'lot', 'scenes', 'end', 'unexpected', 'little', 'gags', 'plenty', 'off-kilter', 'goofiness', 'middle', 'otherwise', 'gruesome', 'serious', 'scenes', 'Rocco', 'groping', 'passed-out', 'stripper', 'blowing', 'away', 'mafia', 'underboss', 'Good', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Goodfellas']",The Boondock Saints

Considering the nauseating stuff that comes out of Hollywood these days, it's probably not a surprise-the better something is, the less chance it will ever see a big screen. Case in point: right here. Two Irish brothers (The Dead Zone's Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus, recently seen in Blade 2) try to prevent the closing down of an Irish bar on St. Patrick's Day by the Russian mafia. Things go wrong, but the right guys wind up dead. While the murder is investigated by the oddest FBI agent you're likely to find on a screen for the past twenty years (Willem Dafoe), the brothers, along with their halfwit sidekick Funnyman (David Della Rocco-whose character has the same given name as the actor) from the Italian mob, decide that vigilantism seems like the right path to be taking with their careers. The boys form the Boondock Saints and start cleaning up the streets, and the more the FBI Agent sees of their work, the more conflicted he gets as to whether he should be catching them or aiding them. The mobs-both Russian and Italian-are not so happy, and so they recruit a stone killer known only as Il Duce (Billy Connolly, who's been in so many good movies he should've been in Hollywood's A-list a decade ago) to take the Saints on.Sound complicated? It is. It's also miles and miles of fun. Not for the weak of stomach-the dialogue is not the only way in which Duffy's work resembles Tarantino's. Also not for those who sour quickly on profanity. For the rest of us, this is a treat, a movie with speed-of-light pacing, snappy dialogue, lots of things blowing up, and more panache than you can shake a stick at, pal.Thankfully, The Boondock Saints has hit cult status on video, prodding Duffy to once again take up the pen, hire back all the survivirs from the first film, and start shotting Boondock II: All Saints Day. With any luck, Duffy will get himself a big-screen release and this movie will get the attention it has long deserved from a much wider audience. ...",4,There's a storm comin'... and it's ALL SAINTS DAY!,1049414400,"04 4, 2003",2003,2218,"['Boondock', 'Saints', 'Troy', 'Duffy', '2001', 'Boy', 'howdy', 'surfeit', 'talent', 'funniest', 'dialogue', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'picked', 'up', 'pen', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'went', 'straight', 'video', 'Considering', 'nauseating', 'stuff', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'probably', 'not', 'surprise-the', 'better', 'something', 'less', 'chance', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'Case', 'point', 'right', 'here', 'Two', 'Irish', 'brothers', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'recently', 'seen', 'Blade', '2', 'try', 'prevent', 'closing', 'down', 'Irish', 'bar', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'Day', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'Things', 'go', 'wrong', 'right', 'guys', 'wind', 'up', 'dead', 'murder', 'investigated', 'oddest', 'FBI', 'agent', ""'re"", 'likely', 'find', 'screen', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'brothers', 'halfwit', 'sidekick', 'Funnyman', 'David', 'Della', 'Rocco-whose', 'character', 'same', 'given', 'name', 'actor', 'Italian', 'mob', 'decide', 'vigilantism', 'right', 'path', 'be', 'taking', 'careers', 'boys', 'form', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'start', 'cleaning', 'up', 'streets', 'more', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'sees', 'work', 'more', 'conflicted', 'should', 'be', 'catching', 'aiding', 'mobs-both', 'Russian', 'Italian-are', 'not', 'so', 'happy', 'so', 'recruit', 'stone', 'killer', 'known', 'only', 'Il', 'Duce', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'who', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'movies', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Hollywood', 'A-list', 'decade', 'ago', 'take', 'Saints', 'complicated', 'also', 'miles', 'miles', 'fun', 'Not', 'weak', 'stomach-the', 'dialogue', 'not', 'only', 'way', 'Duffy', 'work', 'Tarantino', 'Also', 'not', 'who', 'sour', 'quickly', 'profanity', 'rest', 'treat', 'movie', 'speed-of-light', 'pacing', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'lots', 'things', 'blowing', 'up', 'more', 'panache', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'pal.Thankfully', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'hit', 'cult', 'status', 'video', 'prodding', 'Duffy', 'once', 'again', 'take', 'up', 'pen', 'hire', 'back', 'survivirs', 'first', 'film', 'start', 'shotting', 'Boondock', 'II', 'Saints', 'Day', 'luck', 'Duffy', 'will', 'get', 'big-screen', 'release', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'attention', 'long', 'deserved', 'much', 'wider', 'audience']",The Boondock Saints

He's also a horses ass of monumental proportions who delights in insulting nearly everyone who crosses his path because clearly no one is as great as he.

A fight ensues in the bar with the Russians and pretty soon the twins find themselves vigilantes with a higher purpose.Willem Dafoe is fantastic, or should I say fabulous, as Paul Smecker, a gay FBI agent who begins to question his own beliefs and morals while tracking the brothers.

582308,A1O9CA15IA31NT,B00005IC54,Short,"[1, 1]","The Boondock Saints. The very title made me curious to see what the movie was all about. Basically, the story revolves around two Irish brothers, who after narrowly escaping an attack by Russian gangsters feel that God has granted them the duty to kill the evildoers in the world. They go into their mission with relish and begin taking out mobsters all over Boston with the help of a friend (who looks like Jesus). Willem Defoe plays a gay FBI agent who is trying to track down the brothers, but sympathizes with them, and feels that what they are doing is neccessary. After a series of successful hits, the Mob calls in a mysterious hitman to kill the brothers. The city becomes the battle ground for ""good"" and evil as all the players gather for the final showdown.One of the best things about this movie is the camera shots. This came out before ""bullet time"" was real big, and the gun fights happen in a way that movies like the Matrix can't match. The violence seems very real, in a Tarantino style. Blood flows often in this film, but its all appropriate to the theme of the movie. I especially like the opening scenes. The song at the beginning ""The Blood of Cu Chulainn"", fits into the movie and sets up the ""Irishness"" that is the heart of this movie. The end credits are cool too showing different people's reactions to the Saints and what they are doing. This is meant to make people think about vigilantees in society and are they appropriate.Fans of movies like Pulp Fiction and Die Hard will like this movie. The stylized action, endless rambling talk about strange topics, and good comedy thrown in to keep the movie from being too depressing.

I thought I was renting a B action flick..I mean, why else would it be straight to video? How wrong I was. This movie is at the top of its genre. Many write it off as a wannabe Tarantino film, but the movie is quite different from Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, as it has many more comedic elements as well as intelligence and wit.Willem Dafoe is EXCELLENT in his role, being calm and collected one minute then a raving homosexual lunatic on the other. The film is very well casted, and Ron Jeremy even makes a cameo as Vincenzo. The film was originally picked up by Miramax and budgeted for huge release, but they wanted to cast Stallone instead of Dafoe...Stallone? Troy Duffy took his script elsewhere, and Franchise Pictures gave him more freedom, and I think it was a great descision on Duffy's part. It's just too bad the film never got a wide realease, even though the cult following has become huge worldwide.I would give this DVD 5 stars, but I cannot. I was very [mad]with this DVD. Two of the most superbly filmed action sequences were cut down in this U.S. version to avoid an NC-17 rating. It truly ruined the film for me. The scene where they drop from the ceiling and dispose of the Russian Mob had slow motion blood trails and bodies getting hit and flying. CUT OUT. The U.S. version looks pathetic, and it looks like they drop from the ceiling and the Russians just fall and die. Then theres the bar scene where Rocco shoots the two henchmen and the barkeep. The original had the guy getting shot in the head, blood spewing, the second guy getting hit in the chest. CUT OUT. The U.S. version shows no blood at all. It's just sad. There are so many other films that are way bloodier but still get a R rating. I was really upset that Boondock was censored for this DVD. It's like listening to a song with a million bleeps in it for censorship...who can be happy with that. The movie is a 5. The DVD is not.The versions in Europe are uncut, but they are region 2, so you have to have an all-region player to view it in the U.S. There have been talks about an NC-17 version being released, but nothing official. I bought the DVD because I love the movie and wanted the deleted scenes and commentary, but am displeased with the censorship.

Zayas,"[1, 4]","Two tough ""Irish"" brothers from South Boston go on a crime-fighting rampage after Russian mobsters try to strong-arm a neighborhood Irish pub into closing up shop.  At first glance, Boondock Saints is just another inner-city shoot-em-up movie, but at closer look it's a supernatural tale.The McManus brothers are supposedly Irish, and speak with heavy brogues, but they curiously speak many languages (Russian, French, Irish, and of course, English.)  Nothing about their background is said.  Their father is a man of almost superhuman killing ability who is known in prison only by a prisoner number.  Except in a gunfight with their father, they are virtually unscathed in their battles.  They are extremely religious and proclaim to be on a mission from the Almighty.  People in their neighborhood call them ""angels,"" an obvious allusion as to who they really are or what they are supposed to be.  Though willing to kill without giving it a second thought, the brothers are endearing and likeable.  It is clear that they are the ""good guys"" despite their bloodlust (directed at ""evil"" men.)The movie is in the vain of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, in that you see the end result of a scene before you see it play out.  The humor is dark and raucous.  The characters are over-the-top.  Willem Dafoe's homosexual, opera-loving, crime-solving genius FBI agent is the most intriguing of the characters.If you like the kind of lighthearted way in which violence and death are treated in movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs or Snatch, you'll not be bothered by the almost cartoonish violence of this movie.  The story is beyond believable.  It is pure pulp, a tale fit for a comic book series.  But it is entertaining.

Even in light of the director being a jerk and BS2 being so bad, I have heard that this is the most awesome Tarantino imitator movie ever. To be this cool, you have to watch Tarantino.Instead, I got a superhero movie with two brogue spouting actors playing a couple of invincible crazed killers who mow down armies of mafia types. It starts with the Russians and then goes on to the Italians. Not sure why the Irish mobsters are allowed to live. Maybe there aren't any Irish mobsters. All the Irish stuff is straight out of the Lucky Charms commercials. The mobsters rarely get their accents down. The conceit of having Willem Dafoe reenact the crime scene after the fact in order to show the crime scene works at first but then gets repeated so often that you have to realize that it's a one trick pony directing this thing.And there really is no reason for Dafoe to go in drag at the end beyond the homophobia of a director who thinks taht dudes in dresses is hilarious.The story is idiotic and the dialogue is BS faith stuff. And here's where the movie really grates on my nerves. You know how Samuel Jackson inPulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)says that the Bible verse he's been quoting was something that he just thought was some cold sh-- to say before popping a cap in some guy's a--? Well that scene works because it is at the center of this conflicted character who realizes that he has to completely reevaluate his life and that he's had the tools to repentence all along and he's been misusing them. In this movie, the prayers and the Bible quotes are simply ways for the screenwriter to fill up space when he runs out of variations on swear words.Of course, I doubt anyone thinks that the guns and faith thing is serious.

It's about two boring idiots who kill a bunch of evil idiots and can't die or get hurt.

Also, the CONSTANT flashbacks are annoying at times. What I do like are the 2 lead characters sent on a ""mission from God"" to kill. The dialogue is also entertaining even if writer/director Troy Duffy jumped on the Pulp Fiction (aka anything goes) bandwagon at the time. Willem Dafoe is a riot as a gay FBI agent and Billy C is great as a crazy hit man. The movie has developed quit a cult status and I say good for Boondock Saints. It's far from perfect, but is worth a look.

582337,A19KVHOG0DGM4P,B00005IC54,"Tony Hall ""If the movie stinks, just don't go!""","[8, 17]","I really hated this movie and that's why I gave it more than one star. The second star is for actually making me feel strongly about it and just in case the movie was intentionally made to offend one's wits. I'll explain...Where do I begin. I guess I start with the plot. The idea of two supposedly religious Catholics with no morals themselves going on a killing spree in the name of God is completely unbelievable. If something like this happened in real life, it would take someone who is incredibly stupid or incredibly ill. This movie has no suspension of disbelief. The characters were hypocrites and worse than the people they were executing. I found the plot ludicrous as a non-religious person and found it insulting to Christianity. Anybody that knows anything about the Bible would consider this movie an abomination.The characters were dull, childish, idiotic, one dimensional meatheads and their dialogue mostly consisted of unnecessary bickering full of over the top swearing. The rest of the dialogue sounded like it was written by a ten year old who's watched a few episodes of NYPD Blue. The over-acting was embarrassingly dramatic at times.There were a few genuinely funny moments, but most of the humor was so low brow I just shook my head. The writers were trying too hard to be politically incorrect, but yet copped out by making a point to insult ALL ethnic groups equally in the forced racist dialogue. Their strategy, which was to stoop to the lowest level for laughs, was obvious to me and a sure sign of someone who isn't actually funny but tries to compensate by using cheap, offensive material.I don't know who made this movie or what kind of point they were trying to make, but there were too many things that didn't make sense. Killing people for beating off at a strip club doesn't make sense. One of the people in the movie also mentions killing drug dealers... the bible doesn't say that drugs are a sin. Homosexuality, on the other hand, is a sin and the forth member of The Saints (Willen Dafoe) is a homosexual.I just can't enjoy a poorly made flick about a gang of stupid religious hypocrite vigilantes. I found it insulting to my intelligence and I wondered what the point was. I wondered if the director was a Catholic trying to make Catholicism seem cool. I wondered what was up with all the Irish/Italian crap. I felt like the director was almost making a subtle Irish vs. Italians film. Is the director Irish and does he have a problem with Italians? I just kept thinking ""what's the point?"" and ""how long can they drag this out"".I can't understand why people like this movie so much. The hero's killings are unjust and I just couldn't get into it. They're not good, not evil, just dumb.BUTI also wondered if the film makers wanted to make a movie that was so preposterous and unbelievable that it's actually making a case AGAINST the supposed cause of the protagonists. In other words, they paint such a painfully repulsive portrait of the hypocrisy of vigilantism that they're truly making a Christian argument about not ""casting the first stone"" and ""turning the other cheek"".At the end when they're showing the ""man on the street"" news clips, perhaps they're trying to show how stupid people are... how people will praise ""The Saints"" even though they probably shouldn't. If you read the reviews on this site, they go right along with the sound bites during the credits. IF THAT IS THE CASE, THE MOVIE IS BRILLIANT. That's why I give the movie two stars rather than one... ya know, just in case. But I still think it's unlikely since the main characters are portrayed as being these super cool alpha males... a combination of the Blues Brothers and Jay and Silent Bob.Regardless, it made me feel strongly and I guess that makes it worth something.",2,Are you kidding?

For those who haven't, I'll save you two hours: Two really really ridiculously Irish Catholic brothers (visible from their oversized crosses, tattoos, and alcohol tolerance) go on a rampage, killing Russians, Italians, and Ron Jeremy, because their favorite pub was shut down. And Willem DeFoe is a cross-dressing homosexual FBI agent who doesn't serve much purpose, despite being the only interesting character. There's some half-to-full-baked politics on display: something about ""eye for an eye"" or ""the guilty must be punished"" that just serves as an excuse for people shooting at each other in slow motion.And did I mention it was gay? There's an uncanny connection in cinema between violent, right-wing rhetoric and homoeroticism. And I'm not just talking about DeFoe; the MacIrish brothers show no interest in women, obsession with phallic objects (guns), and a signature execution style that gives new meaning to ""money shot"" (they also pray when they do this, 'cause they're just so frickin' Irish). There's also a scene where (I'm assuming) God or  Heaven or Michael Collins is commanding them with thunder to go kill lots of bad people and they are both shirtless and sporting O faces not seen outside of porn.

582341,A1A2SWJHNJ10FP,B00005IC54,"Troy Kearney ""avid reader""","[7, 7]","There are movies that when they are initially released are underground successes that suddenly and without warning become iconic when they reach the mainstream audience once they are released on VHS/DVD.  Can Boondock Saints be considered one of these rare films?  Definitely!The titular Saints are two Irish brothers, Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus) who find themselves turned from ordinary citizens in their Irish neighborhood in South Boston into vigilante heroes on a self-ordained mission of God to rid their neighborhood of the Russian Mob.It starts when they get into a fistfight in their local bar and nearly end up getting killed by the mobsters who visited the bar, but instead end up killing the mobsters in the most inventive way imaginable.  However, the duo believe that they are messengers of God's vengeance and go on a violent seek and destroy mission to get the head boss, teaming up with one of their closest friends (David Della Rocco).Meanwhile, as the body count begins to rise, an FBI agent (Willem Dafoe) with a few eccentricities is assigned to the case and uses his unique way of reconstructing what happened at the crime scenes (which we vividly see in the flashbacks) in such a way that makes the team of CSI look more like grade school rookies.As the two sides converge on the ultimate climax in the final battle to take down the boss, a third unexpected variable is thrown into the mix when (via flashback)a mysterious gunman with some tie to the Saints (I won't give it away)appears at one ot the crime scenes.The film is definitely an amazing debut for director Troy Duffy, using actors who really make you feel the story and relationships (especailly Flannery and Reedus) as it progresses to the end and characters that (at times unintentionally) make you laugh out loud.

582343,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005IC54,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","I first heard about THE BOONDOCK SAINTS from one of my roommates last year. He had the soundtrack of the film (including the speech from the courtroom) downloaded on his computer and was playing it one night when I came into the room. I asked him about the music and then the movie. I became quite interested in the movie and rented it out the first opportunity I had.THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is reminiscent of the films of Quentin Tarantino, both in violence and in creative, original, and witty dialogue. However, THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is quite different from the films of Tarantino. The movie creates a style almost totally of its own.Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) are Irish twin brothers living in poverty in Boston, but enjoying all that life has to offer them. One night while enjoying some brew at their favorite pub, the brothers beat up some unfriendly Russians. Unbeknownst to them, the Russians are part of the Russian mafia. They hunt the brothers down to their decapitated living space, tie one brother to a toilet, and take the other brother outside to shoot him. But the MacManus brothers (like the real life Sullivan brothers from the first half of the 20th century) are inseparable. They are connected by a special bond and surprise the mobsters and end up killing them.A special detective, Paul Smecker (William Dafoe) is brought in to investigate. After figuring out what happen a bulletin is sent out. Moments later, immediately after leaving the hospital, the brothers turn themselves into the police. It's decided that the act was self defense and they are released. The brothers soon figure out that the deed they did, though unintentional, was good and decide to continue the good work they've begun. Knowing only what they've seen in movies, Connor and Murphy begin a vigilante killing spree, seeking out the filth and scum of the criminal underbelly of the city. They are joined their Russian friend, David Della Rocco, and the scourge begins. Smecker begins tracking the brothers, but as he does, he begins to have a clash of conscience. The brothers are doing what the police should have been doing all along but can't because of political correctness and bureaucracy. Are the brothers really on a mission from God, or are they just devils in disguise?The acting in the film is excellent. Dafoe is kind of a creepy actor, but he portrays the role of Smecker well. The chemistry between Flanery and Reedus as Connor and Murphy is so lifelike. They make the brothers believable. I don't know much about Reedus, but this is one of the best roles Sean Patrick Flanery has had since he was cast as Young Indiana Jones over ten years ago. The script is well written and tends to avoid cliches. Also, the courtroom speech at the end is one of the better speeches to be heard on film in the past decade.Not everyone will like THE BOONDOCK SAINTS. There is a lot of violence and cursing. However, the movie doesn't so much have a powerful message, but it does raise some very interesting questions (what is truth and justice, are the brothers really agents of God).

582344,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B00005IC54,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[0, 0]","Bartender turned director Troy Duffy's contemporary action melodrama ""The Boondocks Saints"" bears all the influences of Quentin Tarantino with its ultra-violent shoot-outs, use of profanity, over-the-top situations, fractured time lines and gallery of memorable characters.  Two multi-lingual Irish lads from South Boston awaken one day after they hear the Lord tell them to hit the vigilante trail.  Actually, despite its far-fetched storyline, ""The Boondocks Saints"" spouts the message that evil flourishes only when good men look the other way.  Duffy hammers this theme home in an early scene  when the minister recaps the real-life tragedy of Kitty Genovese. In 1964, Genovese was raped and murdered near her home while thirteen eyewitnesses cowered in either fear or indifference to her plight back and did not intervene.  Consequently, ""The Boondocks Saints"" advocates vigilantism.  Unfortunately, whatever credibility that Duffy generates for his message is obliterated by those kinetically staged gunfights, rampant profanity, and the melodramatic plot twists.  Basically, ""The Boondocks Saints"" is a beer & pizza saga that shows some tolerance for homosexuality because one of its chief characters--an erudite FBI agent--is gay but not gay is an over-the-top way.  Sadly, this independently produced actioneer got lost in the politics of its day.  According to Duffy, the Columbine massacre prompted the distributers to curb release of the film because of its violent fare.  The heroes--who perform primarily good deeds--dress in black like the Columbine gunmen and wipe out Russian mobsters galore.  Nevertheless, this ranks as first-rate entertainment if you enjoy gritty gunplay, provocative characters, and some surreal staging.  People who love cats may not enjoy ""The Boondocks Saints"" because a cat is accidentally shot and splattered like a tomato against a wall  Of course, the actual cat was never harmed, but some cat lovers cannot differentiate between reality and illusion so this film may leave a dire taste in their mouths.The Cold War has concluded and Russian criminals have migrated to America and the Russian syndicate is buying up property in Boston, much to the chagrin of some leaseholders, like poor old Doc (Gerard Parkes of ""Short Circuit 2"") a barkeeper afflicted with Tourette's syndrome who runs McGinty's Bar.  The patrons are celebrating Saint Patrick's Day when three imposing big bruisers, among them Ivan Checkov (Scott Griffith), walk in to lay down the law and encounter the McManus twins, Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery of ""The Suicide Kings"" ) and Murphy (Norman Reedus of ""Deuces Wild""), who precipitate a barroom brawl with them.  They tied the biggest Russian to the bar and set his butt on fire.  The next day two of the Russians, including burnt butt, barge into their apartment.  They handcuff Connor to a toilet and threaten to kill Murphy.  Connor rips out the toilet--possible but not likely--and goes to the roof and drops it on the biggest Russian and saves his brother from certain death.  FBI Special Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe of ""Platoon"") launches an investigation because he is part of the Organized Crime Task Force.  Smecker hooks himself up to his portable CD player, pops on his disposable gloves, and analyzes the crime scene to the strains of classic composer Puccini's operatic La boh&egrave;me.  Although the chronology of the scene is fractured like a Tarantino bloodbath, Duffy appears to invoke the kind of cross-cutting that worked so well for Hong Kong director John Woo so that we get to see both the crime and the analysis of the crime.Later, when Smecker presents the details of the crime to his colleagues, he is in the same shot with our heroes when they perform their community service. Our heroes give themselves up and Smecker lets them go and informs the Boston press that they killed the Russians in self-defense.  Later, our heroes hear voices and believe that the Lord wants them to destroy evil men.  The MacManus brothers receive help from one of their loony friends, David Della 'Roc (David Della 'Roc' of ""Jake's Corner""), who serves as an errand boy of sorts for the Boston mob.  He provides our heroes with all the information that they need to start wiping out mobsters with extreme prejudice.  Roc is the crazy one of the bunch and he lacks the focus of the MacManus twins.  Meanwhile, Smecker investigates each convoluted crime scene and shows the Boston Police, particularly the three detectives on the case, Dolly (David Ferry), Duffy (Brian Mahoney) and Greenly (Bob Marley), why he is such a genius.  By now, our heroes have become `saints' in the newspapers, and they obtain a cache of silenced automatic pistols with which to carry out their work.  When they ice top-level hoods, Connor and Murphy utter a prayer while they have their victim on his knees and shoot him through the back of the head so that their bullets exit through the eye sockets.  Afterward, they place pennies on the dead man's eyes.  Each execution gets wilder and crazier until the mobsters catch up with them.  Meanwhile, Smecker has so underestimated the MacManus brothers that he never imagines what they have been doing until Roc loses a finger during a shoot-out and he connects them with Roc.  By this time, the mob has declared war on them.""The Boondocks Saints"" is for action-oriented film fans who know they are only watching a movie.  Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are perfectly cast as brothers and they kindle a lot of charisma as vigilantes in the tradition of Charles Bronson from the ""Death Wish"" movies.  Make no mistake, however, Willem Dafoe and David Della 'Roc' steal the show.  Close behind them in his peripheral role is Gerard Parkes who has only a couple of scenes, but he is unforgettable, especially with his use of the F-bomb and the A-word followed in rapid succession.  Mind you, ""The Boondocks Saints"" is not remotely believable, but it is a terrific, entertaining, action-packed opus with colorful character, blue dialogue, and Duffy's imaginative staging.",5,Entertaining Actioneer,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,6077,"['Bartender', 'turned', 'director', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'contemporary', 'action', 'melodrama', 'Boondocks', 'Saints', 'influences',

You most certainly will enjoy Dafoe. With only the slightest of swishes and weaving of arms, he probes gruesome crime scenes listening to opera on a headset while at the same time one-upping the local detectives with Sherlockian aplomb. Dafaoe is the best thing about ""The Boondock Saints"" and the only reason to watch it.We are asked to like a pair of Irish brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) who go about cold-bloodedly murdering Russian gangsters because God has told them to abolish evil. But that's not the worst of it. Family and friends, the Church, the media, the FBI agent, all appear to admire their vigilantism and cheer them on, even after they are joined by a mad dog Ialian and a gun-toting senior citizen who really belongs in Quentin Tarentino's ""Reservoir Dogs.""There's interest in the timely vigilante theme, in the way we are shown the killings only as the agent reconstructs them (and sometimes moves amidst them), in how the gay agent interacts with the macho cops, and in the Church's complicity, but the director has failed to generate it. The editing, with its deadly blackouts, is particularly uneven. Dafoe holds the screen whenever he's on and is a hoot.

The Boondock Saints was just a superficial cross between Scorsese's Mean Streets and Quentin Tarantino with a twist of Badlands.  I have just mentioned two great films and one extraordinarily gifted filmmaker.  You take these three ingredients, throw them into a pot, boil them and serve them and you are left with a bad taste in your mouth.The film is about two brothers who feel that some local gangsters are making life miserable for the people in their community so they take it upon themselves to eliminate these gangsters.  Supposedly they become heros to the locals.  The FBI, led by Willem Dafoe in a throwaway performance, are also on their tails.  The main thing that I had a problem with was that it is never really convincingly established that the gangsters are that bad.  Not to say that they are good but I guess that the writer thinks that by giving them the title of gangster it makes it okay that the two brothers kill them off.Willem Dafoe gives a wacky, over-the-top performance that somehow seems like it may have played better in another movie.  Billy Connelly from Mrs. Brown plays another killer who coincidentally ends up joining the bros in their vigilante exercises.The problem that I had with the film is that I could never believe that what the brothers were doing was justifiable.  They seemed more like the villains, more heartless and coldblooded than the gangsters ever were.The end of the film put the nail in the coffin when during the credit sequence you get to hear all of these civilians commenting on what they thought of the bros.  Some thought that what they were doing was good and justifiable.  Others thought that they were no better than the gangsters.  And it goes back and forth.  I guess it was trying to comment of society and the media and their love/hate relationship with murderers and other criminal.  Please, tell me something I don't know.  This theme has been presented in so many movies over the past 40 years that it has become almost a cliche.  After all this glorified murder and action the director has the audacity to try and preach this oh so important message to us.  I would just like to thank him for sharing these enlightening facts with us.  Maybe it will make us all better human beings.The only think that could have saved this film for me is if it had a little ironic twist at the end like two other vigilante-type bros coming out and killing the MacManus brothers.  Then it might get two stars.

Although people might wish to read something into this movie, it is simply an AMAZING STORY, capped off by an Oscar-worthy performance by Willem DaFoe.When two Irish brothers decide to go vigilante, an eccentric cop, a slimy best friend, and a host of Mob Bosses and hitmen get involved.  The result is one of the most clever yet uncluttered, violent but sympathetic, and tragic yet hilarious movies of the past few decades.  Although not a huge smash when it came out, Boondock Saints has gained a huge cult following thanks to its strong central premise, underdogs to root for, and, as mentioned earlier, an INCREDIBLE performance by DaFoe.  You have to think that if he had played this part in a movie that would be taken seriously by the Oscars, he'd definitely of had a shot at Best Supporting Actor.  A conflicted gay detective who solves crimes while listening to Opera could have easily been a joke role, but DaFoe somehow makes him that more captivating.  He lends a mind to the film when it threatens to degenerate into unrelated mindless killing scenes.DaFoe's performace is probably enough to warrant a PURCHASE of this film, but if you're just looking for a bit of the ol' ultraviolence to spice up your evening, Boondock Saints is well worth the RENTAL.",4,Lots of Rewatchability!!!!,1092614400,"08 16, 2004",2004,1341,"['one', 'movies', 'pretensions', 'burden', 'story', 'people', 'might', 'wish', 'read', 'something', 'movie', 'simply', 'AMAZING', 'STORY', 'capped', 'off', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Willem', 'DaFoe.When', 'two', 'Irish', 'brothers', 'decide', 'go', 'vigilante', 'eccentric', 'cop', 'slimy', 'best', 'friend', 'host', 'Mob', 'Bosses', 'hitmen', 'get', 'involved', 'result', 'one', 'most', 'clever', 'yet', 'uncluttered', 'violent', 'sympathetic', 'tragic', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'movies', 'past', 'few', 'decades', 'not', 'huge', 'smash', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'gained', 'huge', 'cult', 'following', 'thanks', 'strong', 'central', 'premise', 'underdogs', 'root', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'INCREDIBLE', 'performance', 'DaFoe', 'have', 'think', 'had', 'played', 'part', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Oscars', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'had', 'shot', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'A', 'conflicted', 'gay', 'detective', 'who', 'crimes', 'listening', 'Opera', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'joke', 'role', 'DaFoe', 'somehow', 'more', 'captivating', 'mind', 'film', 'when', 'degenerate', 'unrelated', 'mindless', 'killing', 'scenes.DaFoe', 'performace', 'probably', 'enough', 'warrant', 'PURCHASE', 'film', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'bit', 'ol', 'ultraviolence', 'spice', 'up', 'evening', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'well', 'RENTAL']",The Boondock Saints
