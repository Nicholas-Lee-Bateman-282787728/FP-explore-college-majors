But for those who saw this on their list of recommendations and wonder what exactly they'd be hearing....folks, this is the sort of thing that appeals to green-beer-drinking, Danny-Boy-singing, kiss-me-I'm-Irish crowds. Generally the senior members of that demographic. The fact that he actually comes from Ireland makes it all the more embarrassing. Usually only the Irish American auld-sod-wannabes come up with this sort of thing. His singing voice is positively adequate, his choice of material is all stuff you'd hear on an easy listening radio station. Even the so-called IRISH material---mostly sentimental ballads-- is of the sort that the real Irish singers won't touch, and he lends it all a lounge-singer flavour. Ditto his so-called country songs. The guy's gonna grow up to be Lawrence Welk. McWelk. O'Welk.",1,"Ye gods! He's invaded our shores!

734715,A1SLVEBLUCOCO2,B000087F4C,T. N.,"[1, 4]","This singer is very puzzling to me. Some of his songs are simply wonderful, which prompted me to look for more only to find many of them are just horrible. I suspect that the songs that I find great were somehow enhanced by studio techniques because in this DVD his live voice sounds very average. In addition his effeminate style is so annoying and I really think this singer is better heard than seen.Still I like his choice of material. This kind of light, simple, sweet music is almost no longer sung by comtemporary artists. For that reason alone I'll probably continue to watch his music hoping to pick out something I can enjoy.",2,"Good material, average voice, annoying style",1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,635,"['singer', 'very', 'puzzling', 'songs', 'are', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'prompted', 'look', 'more', 'only', 'find', 'many', 'are', 'just', 'horrible', 'suspect', 'songs', 'find', 'great', 'were', 'somehow', 'enhanced', 'studio', 'techniques', 'DVD', 'live', 'voice', 'sounds', 'very', 'average', 'addition', 'effeminate', 'style', 'so', 'annoying', 'really', 'think', 'singer', 'better', 'heard', 'seen.Still', 'choice', 'material', 'kind', 'light', 'simple', 'sweet', 'music', 'almost', 'no', 'longer', 'sung', 'comtemporary', 'artists', 'reason', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'continue', 'watch', 'music', 'hoping', 'pick', 'out', 'something', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A
