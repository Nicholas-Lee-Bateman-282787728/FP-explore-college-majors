257904,A15D7M6G0VF28A,6301599918,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","The New German Cinema that flowered in the 1970's had many directorial wunderkind -- Herzog, Wenders, Volker Schloendorff. But with this film, Rainer Werner Fassbinder nosed ahead of the pack with the international arthouse audience. In many ways it's a very accessible film, largely because Brigitte Mira is so wonderful in her heart-breaking portrayal of sad, lonely Emmi who knows that to love and be loved is more important than anything else. But for some viewers, Fassbinder's development as a filmmaker from his roots in theatre make his work seem strangely artificial and 'stagey'. This film is no exception. Trademark Fassbinder techniques are all over this one, from his lurid color palette; the even, slow movement of his edit; the slightly stiff, delayed-reaction mannerisms of the actors; the mirror shots; the carefully orchestrated dialogue. What cannot be ignored is how bold and forceful his filmmaking had become by this mid point in his career. Fassbinder tells a story of racism in German society, and its lingering connection with Nazism, that is shocking and terribly moving. I know some viewers feel that the way the story turns mid-way is contrived, but again Fassbinder is taking a brutally realistic viewpoint; that people will hide their true feelings when their self-interest is at stake. What is truly refreshing, and something that could never be done by a Hollywood director, is the way Fassbinder ends the story. It's an incredible mix of hope, optimism and despair that refuses to tie things up in a nice, ""happy' parcel. By disdaining an ending that puts the world right again, Fassbinder created a film that lives in the memory and which rightfully makes a claim to greatness.",5,The Best Film of the New German Cinema?,1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,1711,"['New', 'German', 'Cinema', 'flowered', '1970', 'had', 'many', 'directorial', 'wunderkind', 'Herzog', 'Wenders', 'Volker', 'Schloendorff', 'film', 'Rainer', 'Werner', 'Fassbinder', 'nosed', 'ahead', 'pack', 'international', 'arthouse', 'audience', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'accessible', 'film', 'largely', 'Brigitte', 'Mira', 'so', 'wonderful', 'heart-breaking', 'portrayal', 'sad', 'lonely', 'Emmi', 'who', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'more', 'important', 'anything', 'else', 'viewers', 'Fassbinder', 'development', 'filmmaker', 'roots', 'theatre', 'make', 'work', 'seem', 'strangely', 'artificial', 'film', 'exception', 'Trademark', 'Fassbinder', 'techniques', 'are', 'one', 'lurid', 'color', 'palette', 'even', 'slow', 'movement', 'edit', 'slightly', 'stiff', 'delayed-reaction', 'mannerisms', 'actors', 'mirror', 'shots', 'carefully', 'orchestrated', 'dialogue', 'What', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'how', 'bold', 'forceful', 'filmmaking', 'had', 'become', 'mid', 'point', 'career', 'Fassbinder', 'story', 'racism', 'German', 'society', 'lingering', 'connection', 'Nazism', 'shocking', 'terribly', 'moving', 'know', 'viewers', 'feel', 'way', 'story', 'mid-way', 'contrived', 'again', 'Fassbinder', 'taking', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'viewpoint', 'people', 'will', 'hide', 'true', 'feelings', 'when', 'self-interest', 'stake', 'What', 'truly', 'refreshing', 'something', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'way', 'Fassbinder', 'story', 'incredible', 'mix', 'hope', 'optimism', 'despair', 'tie', 'things', 'up', 'nice', 'happy', 'parcel', 'disdaining', 'ending', 'world', 'right', 'again', 'Fassbinder', 'created', 'film', 'memory', 'rightfully', 'claim', 'greatness']",Ali: Fear Eats the Soul VHS

He released three pretty diverse films that showed off his talents in different angles and really helped to create a rather vivid portrait of who he was as a director.  &#8216;Ali: Fear Eats the Soul&#8217; was his most intimate and ultimately most effective films released that year.  Telling the story of an older German woman, Emmi, who falls in love with a younger Arab during a time when it was socially thought to be in poor taste, &#8216;Ali: Fear Eats the Soul&#8217; is a stirring social commentary that builds strong characters and leaves a lasting impression on the audience.  Emmi is immediately abandoned by those supposedly close to her, even chastised and treated as a sinner, but she is determined to be happy in her relationship, even when that relationship is difficult.  Both Emmi and Ali find themselves separated not only by the judgmental eyes around them but also by their own social and racial differences, and soon they are fraying.  This is a sharp look at racism but also at the human desire for happiness and the lengths one will go to avoid the loneliness and fear that &#8216;eats the soul&#8217;.",5,Astute look at human nature&#8230;,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,1187,"['1974', 'was', 'pretty', 'great', 'year', 'Rainer', 'Werner', 'Fassbinder', 'released', 'three', 'pretty', 'diverse', 'films', 'showed', 'talents', 'different', 'angles', 'really', 'helped', 'create', 'rather', 'vivid', 'portrait', 'who', 'was', 'director', '8216', 'Ali', 'Fear', 'Soul', '8217', 'was', 'most', 'intimate', 'ultimately', 'most', 'effective', 'films', 'released', 'year', 'Telling', 'story', 'older', 'German', 'woman', 'Emmi', 'who', 'love', 'younger', 'Arab', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'socially', 'thought', 'be', 'poor', 'taste', '8216', 'Ali', 'Fear', 'Soul', '8217', 'stirring', 'social', 'commentary', 'strong', 'characters', 'lasting', 'impression', 'audience', 'Emmi', 'immediately', 'abandoned', 'supposedly', 'close', 'even', 'chastised', 'treated', 'sinner', 'determined', 'be', 'happy', 'relationship', 'even', 'when', 'relationship', 'difficult', 'Emmi', 'Ali', 'find', 'separated', 'not', 'only', 'judgmental', 'eyes', 'also', 'own', 'social', 'racial', 'differences', 'soon', 'are', 'fraying', 'sharp', 'look', 'racism', 'also', 'human', 'desire', 'happiness', 'lengths', 'one', 'will', 'go', 'avoid', 'loneliness', 'fear', '8216', 'soul', '8217']",Ali: Fear Eats the Soul VHS
257906,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,6301599918,Blue Leaf,"[0, 0]","This is my favorite of all the Fassbinder films I have seen thus far. It is the story of an older woman named Emmi played by Brigette Mira. I would guess she is around 60 yrs. old. Emmi falls in love for a much younger Moroccan man nicknamed Ali, (El Hedi ben Salem). They meet one rainy night in small bar after Ali's friends dare him to ask her to dance. They end up spending the night together and find they are very comfortable and happy as a couple. They compliment each other and are truly soul mates in a harsh world full of gossip and ethnic tensions. Everyone around them includeing their friends, family, and colleagues are shocked and disgusted when they marry. Although this film is heralded as a melodrama, closely resembling the melodramas of Douglas Sirk, I looked at the film as more of a societal look at an unconvential relationship whose bond of love was much stronger than any rules of marital, societal or so called moral convention could break. The acting, the directing, and in particular the symbolism of each scene are astonishingly powerful. I have seen this film three times now and each time my awareness of the subtle and not so subtle undertones of the film become more vivid and impressive. Two scenes in particular stand out. First, the scene which takes place in one of Hitlers old favorite restaurants, which Emmi takes Ali to celebrate after they get married. The true naivete of Emmis character stands out and we begin to see the contradictions in her nature and it gives us a glimpse as to the contradictions of post-war German society. Second, the scene in a park of yellow tables where Emmi finally breaks down from all hostility that has been aimed at her since they first became a couple. Beautifully filmed with a wonderfully powerful performance by Ms. Mira. The plot is simple yet the relationship between the two main characters is complex and profound.

Emmi Kurowski is an older widow who finds herself going through the motions of life without any meaningful relationships to share it with. To avoid a rain shower one afternoon she takes refuge inside a local bar and it's there where she meets Ali, a Morrocan mechanic who's much her junior. The two share a dance and their improbable relationship begins. What ensues is a union that sparks widespread aversion towards the couple and their resolve to overcome such animosity.Fassbinder takes the cultural prejudice of a post war Germany and creates a film with universal appeal - one that is just as relevant in today's modern world as it was when it was made. He uses the central characters to depict the fears of not only themselves, but also of society in general. The pace he creates has a unique minimalistic quality and maintains an effortless flow throughout the entire film.

257912,A2BPDFR58H9575,6301599918,Galina,"[6, 7]","This powerful and gentle film tells the story of love and marriage of Emmi, a 60+ widowed German cleaning lady and Ali, a Moroccan immigrant mechanic who is more than 20 (I think close to 30) years her younger. Their affair and the decision to marry shocked everyone who knew Emmi: her grown children, her neighbors, coworkers (mostly, middle-aged widows as herself) and even the owner of a neighborhood grocery shop where she has been a loyal customer for years. The way clever and observant Fassbinder looks at their struggle to keep the relationship is deeply pessimistic - the couple could survive the obstacles that society would create for them. They can survive disapproval, misunderstanding and prejudice but at the very moment they think all problems are in the past, they find the emptiness inside and two lonely hearts together are even worse than one. The more I think of it the more I realize that ""Ali: Fear Eats the Soul"" is among the best, the most poignant, gentlest and heartbreaking descriptions of unavailability for happiness ever filmed. What makes the movie even more poignant is the fact that both Fassbinder and El Hedi ben Salem, the man whom Fassbinder loved and who played Ali committed suicide in the same year, Fassbinder - a few weeks after El Hedi. The film is also a love letter to El Hedi. In one of the film's most moving scene, Emmi looks at the man with whom she so suddenly and desperately fell in love with admiration, longing, and wise sadness while he dries himself after the shower. It is not only Emmi looks at Ali, it is Rainer looks with love and affection at the man he loved through the lenses of his camera.4.5/5",4,"""The story of impossible love""",1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,1660,"['powerful', 'gentle', 'film', 'story', 'love', 'marriage', 'Emmi', '60+', 'widowed', 'German', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'Ali', 'Moroccan', 'immigrant', 'mechanic', 'who', 'more', '20', 'think', 'close', '30', 'years', 'younger', 'affair', 'decision', 'marry', 'shocked', 'everyone', 'who', 'knew', 'Emmi', 'grown', 'children', 'neighbors', 'coworkers', 'mostly', 'middle-aged', 'widows', 'herself', 'even', 'owner', 'neighborhood', 'grocery', 'shop', 'where', 'been', 'loyal', 'customer', 'years', 'way', 'clever', 'observant', 'Fassbinder', 'struggle', 'keep', 'relationship', 'deeply', 'pessimistic', 'couple', 'could', 'survive', 'obstacles', 'society', 'would', 'create', 'can', 'survive', 'disapproval', 'misunderstanding', 'prejudice', 'very', 'moment', 'think', 'problems', 'are', 'past', 'find', 'emptiness', 'inside', 'two', 'lonely', 'together', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'one', 'more', 'think', 'more', 'realize', 'Ali', 'Fear', 'Soul', 'best', 'most', 'poignant', 'gentlest', 'heartbreaking', 'descriptions', 'unavailability', 'happiness', 'ever', 'filmed', 'What', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'poignant', 'fact', 'Fassbinder', 'El', 'Hedi', 'ben', 'Salem', 'man', 'whom', 'Fassbinder', 'loved', 'who', 'played', 'Ali', 'committed', 'suicide', 'same', 'year', 'Fassbinder', 'few', 'weeks', 'El', 'Hedi', 'film', 'also', 'love', 'letter', 'El', 'Hedi', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'moving', 'scene', 'Emmi', 'man', 'whom', 'so', 'suddenly', 'desperately', 'fell', 'love', 'admiration', 'longing', 'wise', 'sadness', 'shower', 'not', 'only', 'Emmi', 'Ali', 'Rainer', 'love', 'affection', 'man', 'loved', 'lenses', 'camera.4.5/5']",Ali: Fear Eats the Soul VHS

257915,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,6301599918,J. O. Booker,"[1, 1]","German Rainer Werner Fassbinder directed this sweet and sad film about an older woman who falls in love with a much younger man. Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is loosely based on Douglas Sirk's All That Heaven Allows starring Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman.  Unlike All That Heaven Allows, which features a mature but strikingly beautiful not-much-older woman in Jane Wyman, Brigitte Mira, who plays the MUCH older German housecleaner--in Ali: Fear Eats the soul--gives new meaning to the phrase ""robbing the cradle."" Her love interest, El Hedi ben Salem, is Ali, a Moroccan guest worker and auto mechanic. Intensifying their age discrepancy is race: Brigitte Mira's character is white and El Hedi ben Salem's character is black. That she and her late husband belonged to the Nazi Party further intensify their unlikely affair.Ali: Fear Eats the Soul begins as an old woman enters a bar. Outside, it's dark and wet; inside the bar, it's warm and dry. The tables in the bar are empty; a few patrons clustered at the bar--including the bartender, a tall, voluptuous, blonde--greet the old woman with hard cold stares. Besides the white bartender, the people clustered at the bar are black. Their strong looks ridicule and isolate the old woman--she becomes self-conscious and feels old and out of her place. As a joke, one of the women at the bar dares one of the men, the most attractive man, to dance with the old woman. That young man, Ali, approaches the old woman. He buys her a drink and they dance. The young women at the bar look in envy upon the slow-dancing couple, the young black man and the old white woman. They are very comfortable in each other's arms. He walks her home. She lives in an old apartment building. It's very late and it's still raining.  She invites the young black man in for a moment, for a drink, and to dry himself a little. They talk. He asks her what she does for a living. She's embarrassed. Reluctantly she tells him that she's a cleaning woman. He seems impressed. She opens up to him. She's lonely. She has children in town but she only sees them on holidays. All of his family is back in Morocco.After a drink and a small--but warm--conversation, the young black man prepares to leave. He lives on the other side of town where he shares a small room with five other men. The old woman invites him to stay at her home in her guestroom. He could leave in the morning when it's dry. Sometime in the night, the black man becomes restless. He knocks on the old woman's bedroom door, and she allows him inside. Thus, begins their unlikely--bittersweet--relationship.This is a sweet, understated, and beautiful film. There are no bad police--a la Spike Lee, no Hiroshimas, and no confrontations with the Klan. Ali: Fear Eats the Soul shows the unseen side of racism by juxtaposing the outward emotions of the interracial couple. The white woman freely expresses her torn feelings at being isolated by her own kind; on the other hand, her young black husband is stoic and seems unconcerned with and unaffected by the racial hostilities directed at he and his wife.

Fassbinder's film takes place in Munich in the shadow of the 1972 Olympics when Arab terrorists took part of the Israel Olympic team hostage, which ended in a blood bath.  Nevertheless, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is a completely unrelated story to the bloodshed that took place in 1972 as it is told around Ali, a Moroccan guest worker, and Emmi, an older German woman, who fall in love with one another.  Ali and Emmi come across each other at a local Arabian bar as Emmi seeks shelter from the rain outside.  Ali and Emmi dance, converse, and Emmi invites Ali home for a nightcap as she is suffering from loneliness.  Together they have to confront prejudice and racism as their relationship progresses since Ali looks and speaks differently than the German people around them.  During their struggle they decide to go on a short vacation in order to escape the intolerance that surrounded them and as they come back Ali and Emmi begin to have their own doubts of their relationship.  Fassbinder's film is a brilliant story and it uses some interesting cinematography that elevates the cinematic experience.  However, the sound quality of the dialogues removes the realistic tone of the environment which sounds recorded and the characters are sometimes awkwardly portrayed by the cast.

The title makes you think that it is a horror flick, but there is little fear and no soul-eating going on.A dark skinned Arab man from Morocco lives in Germany in the 1970s.  The German people, just one or two generations from that happy Nazi Generation we were all so fond of, detest all foreigners and call most of them Ali.  The greatest shame would be for a German woman to marry one, God Forbid.  That would make her a whore.Enter Emmi, a middle aged German widow.  Enter Ali, a young Arab man who turns out to like middle aged German widows who are nice.  They dance, they talk, they go to bed, they get married.  It is an impulse marriage.  They hardly know each other, and the engagement is a matter of hours, not months.Much of the impact of the movie comes from the reaction that Emmi's neighbors, co-workers and children have to her apostasy.  They shun her.  One of her sons kicks her tv set in.  It really doesn't pay for someone to be non-German in Germany.  It gets you despised.  A generation or two after murdering every Jew in sight, these lovely people are two minutes away from doing it again, to other foreigners in their midst.  It reminds me of how proud the German people are of themselves in those beer commercials, and those car commercials, as they boast of their German heritage.  I've never once seen a Toyota commercial boasting of its Japanese origin.  On the contrary, many Toyota commercials are more American than apple pie, French fries and baseball.It surprised me that a German language film would be propaganda against the German people.  I'm not exaggerating.  For half the film, you can't help but hate Germans because of how they are portrayed here.The movie takes a sharp turn later on, and stops being a propaganda film against the German people and their racism.  It starts to be about our happy couple, Emmi and her forbidden husband Ali.  Each of them begins to show a fault or two, like Emmi's crotchety ways, bullying Ali about not eating couscous and becoming more German, and Ali's reaction, to seek out some solitude and an old girlfriend.As for the German people, they stop being ""haters"" and start being ""takers"", as they decide to stop harassing and shunning poor Emmi because after all, they need a favor or two.  For example, the son who kicked in her tv set now needs babysitting services, so he apologizes to mom.  The store owner who threw the apostate couple out of his store changes his ways after realizing that he sure could use her patronage.This is an eye opening movie.  I had heard that the German people are extremely racist still, and hate Turks and other foreigners, and in fact attack them every chance they get, like German shepherds who were brought up badly.  Well, now we get to see it, and from a German director no less.I think it is an interesting touch that Fassbinder has his heroin Emmi going to Hitler's favorite restaurant.  This is symbolic of the whole movie.

An older woman, a widow, happens into an Arab bar to escape the rain. This is post-1972 Munich, where the bombing of the Olympic games by Islamic terrorists is still fresh in peoples' minds. But this woman is Emmi, who married a Polish worker years ago despite her own family's prejudices. She raised 3 children with him before he died of an ulcer. Now she's ready to love again.And love she does - she falls for Ali, a Moroccan worker with a gentle soul and a partial command of the German tongue. Ali is 20 years younger than her, but he falls for her gentle ways. They sleep together on the first night, and despite the hostility of her family, her co-workers and local group, she marries him quickly. They are very happy together, but the anger of all around her wear her down. Finally she goes off on a vacation with Ali, promising him that when they return everything will be better.An in an amazingly bizarre plot device, things ARE better. Suddenly everyone who was mean to them before finds reasons to be nice - selfish reasons. The grocer wants her money back. Her son wants her to care for the granddaughter. The apartment-mates need help moving equipment. Emmi doesn't care - she's just happy that everybody is being nice again. But Ali is getting frustrated. He gave up his soul to be with Emmi, and while Emmi is regaining her friends again, Ali has nothing. He is still stuck with a foreign tongue, living in a foreign landscape. All he asks for is some cous cous to remind him of hime - and Emmi harsly tells him to get used to German cooking.So Ali, who is a drifting reed through most of this story, drifts back into his Arab world. He hooks up with a female Arab friend of his who cooks the food he loves and who snuggles with him at night. He plays cards with his Arab buddies while listening to Arab music. Emmi realizes her loss and comes after him. She tells him it's OK if he has other women, other friends. All she wants is his love and his presence, to fight off the loneliness. And Ali admits to her that he loves only her, that he doesn't know how this got so confusing.Then Ali collapses with an ulcer, just like Emmi's immigrant husband did. The doctor tells Emmi that he can't help Ali at all - he can only fix him for now, send him off and expect him to return in 6 months with another ulcer. But Emmi promises that she will make this work - she will reduce the stress so Ali is happy.I really enjoyed this movie, especially in modern day times with all the arguments going on about gay and lesbian marriages. It wasn't that long ago that the color of your skin was enough to bar you from marrying. It's very scary to think that, with so many people hoping someday to find happiness, that we would put barriers in the way of any two human beings who have managed to find it, even if they are years apart in age, or shades apart in color.",5,Brilliant film,1078444800,"03 5, 2004",2004,2980,"['Ali', 'Fear', 'Soul', 'somber', 'German', 'tale', 'Rainer', 'Werner', 'Fassbinder', 'racism', 'Munich', '1970s', 'older', 'woman', 'widow', 'Arab', 'bar', 'escape', 'rain', 'post-1972', 'Munich', 'where', 'bombing', 'Olympic', 'games', 'Islamic', 'terrorists', 'still', 'fresh', 'peoples', 'minds', 'woman', 'Emmi', 'who', 'married', 'Polish', 'worker', 'years', 'ago', 'own', 'family', 'prejudices', 'raised', '3', 'children', 'died', 'ulcer', 'Now', 'ready', 'love', 'again.And', 'Ali', 'Moroccan', 'worker', 'gentle', 'soul', 'partial', 'command', 'German', 'tongue', 'Ali', '20', 'years', 'younger', 'gentle', 'ways', 'sleep', 'together', 'first', 'night', 'hostility', 'family', 'co-workers', 'local', 'group', 'quickly', 'are', 'very', 'happy', 'together', 'anger', 'wear', 'down', 'Finally', 'off', 'vacation', 'Ali', 'promising', 'when', 'return', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'better.An', 'amazingly', 'bizarre', 'plot', 'device', 'things', 'ARE', 'better', 'Suddenly', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'mean', 'finds', 'reasons', 'be', 'nice', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'grocer', 'money', 'back', 'son', 'care', 'granddaughter', 'apartment-mates', 'need', 'help', 'moving', 'equipment', 'Emmi', ""n't"", 'care', 'just', 'happy', 'everybody', 'being', 'nice', 'again', 'Ali', 'getting', 'frustrated', 'gave', 'up', 'soul', 'be', 'Emmi', 'Emmi', 'regaining', 'friends', 'again', 'Ali', 'nothing', 'still', 'stuck', 'foreign', 'tongue', 'living', 'foreign', 'landscape', 'cous', 'cous', 'remind', 'hime', 'Emmi', 'harsly', 'get', 'used', 'German', 'cooking.So', 'Ali', 'who', 'drifting', 'reed', 'most', 'story', 'drifts', 'back', 'Arab', 'world', 'up', 'female', 'Arab', 'friend', 'who', 'food', 'who', 'snuggles', 'night', 'cards', 'Arab', 'buddies', 'listening', 'Arab', 'music', 'Emmi', 'loss', 'OK', 'other', 'women', 'other', 'friends', 'love', 'presence', 'fight', 'off', 'loneliness', 'Ali', 'only', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'got', 'so', 'confusing.Then', 'Ali', 'ulcer', 'just', 'Emmi', 'immigrant', 'husband', 'did', 'doctor', 'Emmi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'Ali', 'can', 'only', 'fix', 'now', 'send', 'off', 'expect', 'return', '6', 'months', 'ulcer', 'Emmi', 'will', 'make', 'work', 'will', 'reduce', 'stress', 'so', 'Ali', 'happy.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'especially', 'modern', 'day', 'times', 'arguments', 'going', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'marriages', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'ago', 'color', 'skin', 'was', 'enough', 'bar', 'marrying', 'very', 'scary', 'think', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'hoping', 'someday', 'find', 'happiness', 'would', 'put', 'barriers', 'way', 'two', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'have', 'managed', 'find', 'even', 'are', 'years', 'apart', 'age', 'shades', 'apart', 'color']",Ali: Fear Eats the Soul VHS
257921,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,6301599918,L. J Nary,"[4, 7]",The movie starts out with groups of people staring at each other which would make anyone feel awkward or different. The directing style reflects distance by showing people far away and then bringing them up close in tightly cramped spaces. The fear is what separates people and eats at you. This is symbolized by Ali's stomach ulcer. In order to connect you have to stand together against all the prejudice and ugliness out there and treat each other well. The more we treat each other with respect the more we can stop the fear growing inside of us. At least this is the way I perceived the film. The director filmed this in 14 days and it was a very small project compared to other movies he made with big budgets. The Arab husband was really the director's lover. The director himself was gay and probably experienced prejudice himself. The movie is slow and awkward but I think it is meant to be this way. A definate must see for anyone who likes foreign film. It is probably one of the best as far as the message it displays and projects on film.Lisa Nary,5,Them against Us or Us against Them,1013644800,"02 14, 2002",2002,1060,"['movie', 'out', 'groups', 'people', 'staring', 'other', 'would', 'make', 'anyone', 'feel', 'awkward', 'different', 'directing', 'style', 'distance', 'showing', 'people', 'far', 'away', 'then', 'bringing', 'up', 'close', 'tightly', 'cramped', 'spaces', 'fear', 'what', 'people', 'eats', 'symbolized', 'Ali', 'stomach', 'ulcer', 'order', 'connect', 'have', 'stand', 'together', 'prejudice', 'ugliness', 'there', 'treat', 'other', 'well', 'more', 'treat', 'other', 'respect', 'more', 'can', 'stop', 'fear', 'growing', 'least', 'way', 'perceived', 'film', 'director', 'filmed', '14', 'days', 'was', 'very', 'small', 'project', 'compared', 'other', 'movies', 'made', 'big', 'budgets', 'Arab', 'husband', 'was', 'really', 'director', 'lover', 'director', 'was', 'gay', 'probably', 'experienced', 'prejudice', 'movie', 'slow', 'awkward', 'think', 'meant', 'be', 'way', 'definate', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'foreign', 'film', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'as', 'far', 'message', 'projects', 'film.Lisa', 'Nary']",Ali: Fear Eats the Soul VHS

257923,A1J1163Q56YIVZ,6301599918,Shaun Anderson,"[1, 1]","The influence of director Douglas Sirk on the output of Fassbinder is notable. Like Sirk, Fassbinder utilised the melodramatic form (a form often dismissed by critics) to take apart and satirise the society he was a part of. ""Fear Eats the Soul"" is one of Fassbinder's more transparent efforts, as he shows the prejudice and jealousy eating away at the heart of society. But unlike ""All That Heaven Allows"" Fassbinder's subject matter deals with a very sensitive and touchy issue in German society at the time. The racial bigotry evident in the film is particularly disturbing, for it shows that the foundations of Nazism, which were after all based initially on racial prejudice are still very much alive. Interweaved into these concerns is a very human tale, which is very affecting on an emotional level. Relationships in Fassbinder films are regularly flawed and miserable prospects and he takes this to an extreme in this film, a doomed quality permeates every scene as does the decadence and apathy, reflected in the dull d&eacute;cor and sleepy character behaviour.

We see a great deal of the reactions from the people around them, which are nearly all negative at first, until after Emmi and Ali go away for a short vacation.  When they return, people seem more accepting, but ironically Emmi starts to objectify Ali (she has her friends touch his muscles, for example) and tells him he has to start eating German food.  This sends him on a sort of jag, and yet we see that they can still make it.  It does sound a bit melodramatic, but it doesn't play that way at all.  The dialogue is very natural and everything flows and makes sense within the movie.  The actors are all completely believable and I found myself engrossed by the movie, which shows the prejudices of German society against Arabs in a non-preachy way.

Either that, or my life experience gave me easier access to its levels.  The optimist and the humanist in me wants to believe that Ali falls in love with Emmi--and vice versa--because both are essentially good people.  As opposed to dwelling on the improbability of such a relationship ever working out--as several characters in ""Ali Fear Eats the Soul"" allude to.  Emmi enters the grungy bar in the opening sequence where she'll met Ali, and the scene is dominated by red tablecloths (a key visual detail, as are the yellow tables in a later outdoor scene).  The gritty ambiance of the characters' various worlds, and their suspicion (""Them""), is juxtaposed against the fundamental goodness, simplicity and compassion of both Emmi and Ali (""Us"").  The cynic in me doesn't want to believe that people are as good as Emmi and Ali.  Because what a price one can pay in our cruel world for being that way.  In the commentary on CD 2 there is some discussion of this film functioning as a ""fable""--IE the nosy neighbors and co-workers in ""Ali Fear Eats the Soul"" whose portrayals are so ""over the top"".  But fable comes closest to describing the essence of the film--if one chooses to, there is something to be learned here.  The POV introduced in the film RE the themes of racism and interracial marriage had to be controversial at the time, and of course, those issues are still problematic.  The soundtrack is used sparingly, only as needed, and it works well in this manner--the Arabic music being a particular highlight.  In the supplemental CD (CD 2), some of the commentary refers to Fassbinder's still tableaux of motionless actors (as ""judgmental voyeurs""); those tableaux immediately reminded me of Fellini (specifically as they manifested in ""Juliet of the Spirits"")--although in Fellini's case, those tableaux are more often comical.  Of the additional supplemental material on CD 2, I especially enjoyed Thea Eymesz' memories of her experience editing the film with Fassbinder, as well as the excerpt from ""The American Soldier"" (an earlier film of Fassbinder's) in which actress Margarethe von Trotta tells the story, in a monologue, on which ""Ali Fear Eats the Soul"" is based.Stephen C.

The city is Berlin, the woman is German and the bar serves a predominantly Arab clientele.  The woman, Emmi (Brigitte Mira) meet a younger, at least twenty years younger, Moroccan man named Ali (El Hedi ben Salem.)  They strike up a conversation.  He walks her home in the pouring rain and she invites him up to her apartment until the pouring rain ends.Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ALI: FEAR EATS THE SOUL is a love story with a difference.  Emmi LOOKS like a 60-plus year-old cleaning woman, while Ali is a virile, good-looking, forty-something, dark-skinned garage mechanic.  Emmi is a German and Ali a Moroccan.  Brigitte Mira can act and El Hedi ben Salem cannot.  About the only thing the two characters have in common is a gnawing loneliness.Their friendship quickly blossoms into love.  When Emmi introduces her new husband to her adult children the news is met with a stern silence followed by an eruption of violence.  In short order Emmi is estranged and disowned by her family, rejected by her friends, more isolated than ever save for the companionship of the man she loves.  Ali's course through the movie is harder to chart, and not just because ben Salem is an inferior actor.  This is a German film about western racism - and ageism - and it is the Germans who undergo the greatest change.Fassbinder's film is quite moving in places, but there were too many times when I felt the message of harmony and acceptance overwhelmed the story and pushed it into places it didn't fit.

When her friends find out, they ridiclule her and when she announces her intentions to marry him, her family disowns her. She is constantly stared at by people on the street and is driven into near-depression because of her relationship.The film has sometimes (and incorrectly as many people contend,) been regarded as a remake to the 1955 film ""All That Heaven Allows"" also released by the Criterion Collection. The plot elements are similar in many respects, with the exception to the couple being interracial.The film was made in response to the racial tensions and anti-Arab sentiment in Germany at the fime following the terrorist attack on the 1972 Olympics in Munich. The film gives an important case for the controversey of interracial marriage which even today some have misgivings about. One can say that another reason for their relationship to be frowned upon is from the copule being of different religions. Though there are a significant number on non-Muslim Arabs. There is no indication in the film though that either of them are religious so if they are both secular, it is not really interfaith. Besides most people devout in their faith would only marry someone of the same faith for a number of reasons, mainly being disagreements about which faith they would raise their children with. Some may speculate that the next remake may involve a homosexual couple, possibly one may have already been made. Not being impartial or neutral to my feelings about homosexuality,  I decline to comment further. You've likely already heard most sides of the argument.The film has some fine acting and contains some great photography. The acting is very impressive for a film with a low budget and remains a popular film to this day.The Criterion Collection DVD has some nice special features also.Disc one contains the film and a the theatrical trailer.Disc two contains the short film ""Angst isst Seele auf."" This is a film shot in first person perspective about an Arab living in Germany who is a victim of a hate crime by group of neo-nazis.There is also the BBC documentary ""Signs of Vigourous Life: New German Cinema,"" a scene from the film ""The American Soldier"", an interview with actress Brigitte Mira and film editor Thea Eym&egrave;sz.

257928,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,6301599918,Turfseer,"[6, 7]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Werner Fassbinder's 'Ali: Fear Eats the Soul' is loosely based on American director Douglas Sirk's 1955 soap opera, 'All That Heaven Allows'. Where Sirk's tale is about a middle class suburban housewife falling for a lower-class gardener who she employs, Fassbinder has bigger fish to fry. His tale focuses on Emmi, a 60ish West German cleaning woman who one day strays into a bar populated by Moroccan immigrants and ends up dancing with Ali, a dark-skinned Moroccan who works at an auto body shop. Fassbinder's strategy is to expose a deeply prejudiced German society who react poorly to Emmi and Ali, after they end up as a couple.For awhile, Emmi is the true hero of the piece, as she endures all kinds of rejection from friends and family, who can't stomach the idea of a good German woman shacking up with (in their eyes) a 'lowly' Arab. The hostility is so intense from the German side that one wonders if Fassbinder has created a coterie of bad stereotypes. Fassbinder himself plays Emmi's son-in-law, a dyed in the wool neo-Nazi if there ever was one and his hatred of all immigrants may represent the bigoted voice of a certain group of reactionaries that still probably exist today, all over Europe. But when one of Emmi's sons smashes a TV set in their first encounter with Ali and they all walk out (including Emmi's daughter and other son) and vow never to talk to the mother again, it's a little too much. The same goes for Emmi's gossipy neighbors and the grocer who Emmi has patronized for years--they too end up shunning her after meeting Ali for the first time. Only a reasonable landlord and a group of even-keeled police officers refuse to play the nasty race card, as Fassbinder suggests that there are only a few good eggs amongst all the bad apples.Are people who have such bigoted inclinations, so blatant about their prejudices? In real life, I say no. They would naturally try and project an image to the contrary, that they're actually tolerant when deep down they're not. Fassbinder's bunch of German nasties become much more palatable in the second half as they now do a 180 and try to suck up to Emmi. Fassbinder makes it clear that their big turn-a-round is hypocritical, because they act entirely out of self-interest and not because they've developed a humanitarian bent. A neighbor now needs Emmi's extra space in her apartment where they can store some extra clothes belonging to a relative who has just come into town. And one of Emmi's sons want her to watch their children as he and his wife need to be at work. There's also the grocer who realizes he's losing business from a good customer and now pretends that he has no problem with Ali and Emmi as a couple. The second half machinations in which friends and family make much more of an effort to accommodate a couple that they deep down despise, rings much more true than the blatant bigots Fassbinder tries to pass off as real people in the first half.Fassbinder wisely brings Emmi down a peg or two in the second half, suggesting that her Nazi past (she reveals she was a Party member ""like everyone else"") is not entirely behind her. After all the hatred brings her to tears in the first half of the film and the unexpected acceptance occurs once she and Ali come back from a vacation, now she's more than willing to join forces again with her unprincipled neighbors (the gossipy women), to the detriment of a new apartment dweller, a cleaning woman from Yugoslavia, who ends up automatically ostracized and the new punching bag for the apartment ladies from hell. Emmi shows further signs of corruption, when she treats Ali as an object, showing off his muscles to her new found fawning friends and attributing his mood swings to a ""foreigner mentality"".While the bulk of German society is taken to task, Fassbinder refuses to even things up on the other side. Heaven forbid that Fassbinder would ever suggest that there's a dark side to the immigrant experience in Germany. Ali is such a non-descript 'good guy', one can only dub him the 'Marty' of the New German Cinema. Despite being put off by all the racism he encounters everyday, he's willing , out of the goodness of his heart, to take Emmi for his wife, despite her physical unattractiveness. The more saintly a portrait Fassbinder paints of Ali, the more you get to sneer at the horrible racist German society, responsible for his lack of acceptance and outright ostracism. Sure, Fassbinder, will throw in a few 'imperfections'--he goes running back to the German barmaid and has a sex with her because Emmi won't cook his favorite 'cous-cous'. But in the end, he'll take that last dance with Emmi before collapsing from a stomach ulcer, brought on by all the stress caused by the bad, bad Germans!The height of irony is our German 'Marty', the actor Ed Hedi ben Salem, ended up in prison after stabbing three people and then committing suicide. Salem was Fassbinder's lover in real life and it's obvious that his fictional character, 'Ali', is nothing more than a completely idealized vision of immigrants as victims. That is not to say that xenophobia in German society doesn't exist as well as outright racism--but Fassbinder, in his zeal to prosecute the failings of his own people, is unable to strike a balanced tone, where the foibles of both sides are dealt with fairly and impartially.In its strongest moments, 'Ali' represents a plea for tolerance of people with different customs. In her strong performance as 'Emmi', Brigitte Mira represents the individual who's willing to 'go it alone', fighting a misguided establishment bent on living in the past by rejecting those who embrace 'alternative lifestyles'.",3,Aggressive critique of bigoted German society undermined by idealized immigrant portrait,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,5716,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain',
