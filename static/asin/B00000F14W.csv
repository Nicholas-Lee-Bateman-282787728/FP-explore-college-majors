When you think of all of the mindlessly fawning portrayals of the monsters of the left (Che Guevara comes to mind in the Motorcycle Diaries, or John Reed, in Reds), is it too much to ask that a movie that shows the other side of them (the side that butchered 100 million people over the course of the last century) be made available?",4,Why Isn't This on DVD?,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,623,"['not', 'perfect', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'films', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'ever', 'made', 'most', 'postwar', 'movies', 'unflinching', 'look', 'evil', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Soviet', 'other', 'Communist', 'bloc', 'allies', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'not', 'out', 'DVD', 'When', 'think', 'mindlessly', 'fawning', 'portrayals', 'monsters', 'left', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'mind', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'John', 'Reed', 'Reds', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'movie', 'other', 'side', 'side', 'butchered', '100', 'million', 'people', 'course', 'last', 'century', 'be', 'made', 'available']",Hanoi Hilton VHS

The New Republic launched its exceptionally vicious review of the film by calling it &quot;filth.&quot;  Other reviewers howled in protest by calling  the film &quot;one-sided,&quot; &quot;virulent,&quot; and so forth.Such  reviews only confirm James Bowman's point about the idiotic film Kids,  namely that the movie reviewing community consists of the most gullible  people in the world, people who would never think to challenge the  assumptions they want to see confirmed in the movies they review.It  confirms this point because what the denunciations of The Hanoi Hilton  really reflect is the film's commitment to truth.The film is about Hoa  Lo prison, one of the most brutal POW prisons in history.  North Vietnam  not only tortured and killed prisoners, it used them as propaganda tools,  and enlisted the aid of Westerners to spread disinformation about Hanoi and  its war aims.The film captures such disinformation actions in two  crucial scenes; early on, an Australian TV journalist (based on the real  life journalist Wilfred Burchette, who aided Communist forces all over the  world and participated in the torture of American pilots in both Korea and  Vietnam) openly in league with the Communists does a piece on a prisoner  who steadfastly refuses to go along with the colossal fraud being permeated  about Communist benevolence.  The Aussie gripes at the prison commandant  (Aki Akeong) about the POW's uncooperative attitude.Later, an American  film actress and her husband (based on Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden) greet the  POWs and ask them to sign an apology &quot;to the women and children you  bombed.&quot;  Of course they did no such thing, and tell her off on  it.Nonetheless she wins the release of a few prisoners, much to the  contempt of almost all of them.  This is one of the film's major themes;  one goes, we all go, as is repeatedly told by the POWs to the prison  commandant.Eventually the POWs are released upon the signing of the  Paris Peace Accords, and celebrate having outlasted the enemy as they take  off for freedom.The film's superb cast, tremendous attention to detail  (the sets were built through extensive consultatition with men who were  imprisoned in Hoa Lo), and Lionel Chetwynd's flawless direction make for a  chilling story.",5,The Horrors Of Hoa Lo Prison And Of Enemy Disinformation,930009600,"06 22, 1999",1999,2349,"['Hanoi', 'Hilton', 'angered', 'lot', 'reviewers', '1987', 'release', 'New', 'Republic', 'launched', 'exceptionally', 'vicious', 'review', 'film', 'calling', 'quot', 'quot', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'howled', 'protest', 'calling', 'film', 'quot', 'one-sided', 'quot', 'quot', 'virulent', 'quot', 'so', 'forth.Such', 'reviews', 'only', 'confirm', 'James', 'Bowman', 'point', 'idiotic', 'film', 'Kids', 'namely', 'movie', 'reviewing', 'community', 'most', 'gullible', 'people', 'world', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'think', 'challenge', 'assumptions', 'want', 'see', 'confirmed', 'movies', 'review.It', 'confirms', 'point', 'what', 'denunciations', 'Hanoi', 'Hilton', 'really', 'reflect', 'film', 'commitment', 'truth.The', 'film', 'Hoa', 'Lo', 'prison', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'POW', 'prisons', 'history', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'not', 'only', 'tortured', 'killed', 'prisoners', 'used', 'propaganda', 'tools', 'enlisted', 'aid', 'Westerners', 'spread', 'disinformation', 'Hanoi', 'war', 'aims.The', 'film', 'captures', 'such', 'disinformation', 'actions', 'two', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'early', 'Australian', 'TV', 'journalist', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'journalist', 'Wilfred', 'Burchette', 'who', 'aided', 'Communist', 'forces', 'world', 'participated', 'torture', 'American', 'pilots', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'openly', 'league', 'Communists', 'piece', 'prisoner', 'who', 'steadfastly', 'go', 'along', 'colossal', 'fraud', 'being', 'permeated', 'Communist', 'benevolence', 'Aussie', 'gripes', 'prison', 'commandant', 'Aki', 'Akeong', 'POW', 'uncooperative', 'attitude.Later', 'American', 'film', 'actress', 'husband', 'based', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Tom', 'Hayden', 'greet', 'POWs', 'ask', 'sign', 'apology', 'quot', 'women', 'children', 'bombed.', 'quot', 'course', 'did', 'such', 'thing', 'tell', 'off', 'it.Nonetheless', 'release', 'few', 'prisoners', 'much', 'contempt', 'almost', 'one', 'film', 'major', 'themes', 'one', 'go', 'repeatedly', 'told', 'POWs', 'prison', 'commandant.Eventually', 'POWs', 'are', 'released', 'signing', 'Paris', 'Peace', 'Accords', 'celebrate', 'having', 'outlasted', 'enemy', 'take', 'off', 'freedom.The', 'film', 'superb', 'cast', 'tremendous', 'attention', 'detail', 'sets', 'were', 'built', 'extensive', 'consultatition', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'imprisoned', 'Hoa', 'Lo', 'Lionel', 'Chetwynd', 'flawless', 'direction', 'make', 'chilling', 'story']",Hanoi Hilton VHS
