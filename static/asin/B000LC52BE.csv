1038892,ADES8B01WRPI3,B000LC52BE,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[12, 25]","The topic of UFOs and alien abductions, whether you believe them or not, are just as encompassing for the victim as being lost in witchcraft or any other occult practices and scenes. The victim can easily lose decades of their lives being haunted by these obsessive topics, and the more the victim researches and is engrossed in finding out ""the truth"" about UFOs and alien abductions, the more precious years of their lives are wasted on the fruitless, negative endeavor. This is a topic that is very deserving of having a film made about it all! But, unfortunately, it is not this film, UNIDENTIFIED.This film, UNIDENTIFIED, is really bad! Not even the brief cameo appearances of Christian rock singer Rebecca St. James is enough to help this movie.The main problem is that it seems to be a movie presenting the Christian perspective about UFOs, but it almost non-existently shows anything about UFOs, which is what should have made the movie unique among low budget Christian films. They talk alot about UFOs, but don't deliver the goods before showing how Christianity solves the UFO problem for believers.When UNIDENTIFIED was in theaters, the local Christian radio stations played commercials for it for months, before and after its release, which had me looking forward to seeing it! After seeing it, I was embarrassed that this was being promoted so heavily on Christian radio because the film is so bad.I was expecting that they would at least make an attempt at special effects and make-up for the UFOs and aliens, no matter how low budget, to try to re-create the widely documented UFO/alien reports and descriptions before debunking them via Christian teachings. Nope. The special effects are basically normal looking actors looking at bright lights. That's it. Dud science fiction. Dud monster movie. Dud Christian movie!This film seems so much like a bait and switch that I think it takes away from its attempt to spread the Christian message at the end of the film. I was extremely disappointed in the lack of UFO content, and the way-too-quick Christian conversion aspects at the end of the film. The end of the film doesn't tie up any loose story lines from the rest of the film, and most questions go unanswered and not specifically addressed or debunked.The writing is awful, and the events are very forced and seem very unrealistic.I like science fiction films and monster movies, from all of the history of cinema, and I am very forgiving over a low budget effort, as long as it is either fun or interesting, or clever. None of those saving graces are present in UNIDENTIFIED.This movie was a very failed attempt at a topic that needs to be addressed in another film, but SHOW the UFOs, and SHOW the alien abductions, THEN debunk them using Bible principles, exposing them for what they are: tricks of the devil for minds of the more ""modern"" mankind. There is a good book available that does just that, and I know of no other book or DVD that does, so please check out ALIEN INTRUSION by Gary Bates.Alien IntrusionThe book, ALIEN INTRUSION, by Gary Bates, delivers the goods in a non-fiction format! This fictional UNIDENTIFIED movie is awful, not because it is fiction, but because it does NOT deliver the goods, no cinema UFOs or movie alien abductions, just really bad writing.",1,An Embarrassment to ALL Overtly Christian Movies!

It is a CHRISTIAN film, for crying out loud.  I read the reviews and one would think it was a Hollywood type gone beserk or something.But then again, I guess this is what people think Christians are: loonies.  First off, the film makes no pretenses about where this is going.  Secondly, it has a Christian message to all, whether one likes it or not, you will be on the side of Jesus or you are not.  Plain and simple.  The UFO phenomena is so strong and so delusional that unless you see it for what it really is, demonic activity, you miss the point of the film.Rich Christiano has been putting out some decent movies of late and are getting better.  He may not have the big budgets of Hollywood movies... and believe me, if he had the $80-$100 million budget, whoa! this would rival any big time Hollywood movie.The film itself could lend to some better dialouge or even a ""heftier"" plot but its main message is that UFO is just demonic activity to delude people into believing what they want to believe and not wanting to be held accountable to the truth.  The truth is that we need Jesus to get to Heaven.  Period.  Most will not like my review but I am not here to win a popularity contest with all you ""intellectual"" types or ""real"" film critics.  I am here to tell you that this film was excellent in bringing its timely message to the masses.  This world is going through a major delusional period that is so strong that even some Christians could be even deceived.This film has merit and is based on what is going on today.

1038901,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000LC52BE,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[15, 33]","""Unidentified"" is a Christian-themed film that supposedly deals with the UFO phenomena.  What it does, however, is take the UFO phenomena and bend it to fit into a message of salvation.  There's nothing wrong with that at all, but a film promoting the Truth should make sure it has its facts right on the other ""truths"" in the film as well.**SPOILERS**This tale centers around the ""alien abductions"" of people and two reporters sent out to cover their stories.  One of the reporters is a firm non-believer and the other is a fence-sitter who isn't sure if he should accept Jesus as his Savior.  As the story unfolds, we are told that all of the abductions are happening to people who are into the occult, witchcraft, drinking, etc.  This ultimately leads up to a supposed ""rapture"" event that opens the eyes of the non-believing reporter.  The only problem is that it's a hoax meant to force the non-believer to think and search out his soul.  The situation with the abducted people is never resolved.  We're just left to think that it was the Devil trying to scare people into not believing and since this one non-believer is saved, there's no need to continue the abductions.So, here's where my problems with this film stand.  First of all, not everyone who claims to have been abducted by aliens has an interest in things such as the occult, witchcraft, alcohol, etc.  Many of them seem to be fine members of society.  Secondly, scaring a person in the way that it was done in this film in order to save his soul comes off both cruel and unnecessary.  Would you honestly want to go to church with people intent on scaring you to salvation?  There's nothing wrong with explaining to someone why they should accept Jesus as their Savior, but tricking them into it is, well, just un-Christian.  I was also surprised how easily the ""Darren"" character could entice people to become Christians.  I don't know what planet he's on, but I've seen only a few cases where people are so abrasively presented with the Gospel message and so easily accepted it.In essence, this film presents its message in a way typical of many (hopefully well-intentioned) self-proclaimed Christians.  They try to jam it down the throats of non-believers and, in my opinion, do a better job of driving away potential Christians than actually convincing them to seek out the truth.Before going one step further, I should state that I'm a Catholic (former Protestant).  There are quite a few reasons why I left the Protestant belief system.  As regarding this film and this review, one of the reasons I left was due to mean-spirited and hateful actions of so-called Christians trying to literally force people to become Christians.  That's not the right way to do it in my opinion.  I don't fault the actors, writers, director, etc. in this film for doing what they did, because I am sure that that is what they believe will bring people to Christ.  However, I just wish Evangelical Christians would try a different tactic than forcing their religion on others.So, I'll probably get a few nasty comments for this review.  I'm prepared for that.  But like St. Francis said so long ago:  ""Preach the Gospel at all times.
