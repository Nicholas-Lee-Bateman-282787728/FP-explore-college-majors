It has too many little problems.Bad things first: Some of the minor object interactions are flawed (like Roman smashing his cigar, Ruby eating the cookies), there are way too many tropes, some characters act stupidly or predictably and a few of the episodes were too short to really make any progress.Good things: Monty's action scenes are fantastic as always, the character designs are creative and well-varied, the voice acting is on par with RVB (a bit weird, but really satisfying), some of the characters who do stupid things (like Weiss starting to get along with Ruby, then being really resistant to her style of leadership (despite the fact that she knows that Ruby is only a kid)) quickly stop doing said annoying thing, the world is interesting so far, several stories are being balanced at once, and you can still relate to most of the characters, even if they can be frustrating sometimes.So, it's still good, but it might be a while before it reaches the heights of Red vs. Blue.",4,"Pretty good, but not RVB great",1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,1046,"['wanted', 'love', 'series', 'can', 'only', 'like', 'too', 'many', 'little', 'problems.Bad', 'things', 'first', 'minor', 'object', 'interactions', 'are', 'flawed', 'Roman', 'smashing', 'cigar', 'Ruby', 'eating', 'cookies', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'tropes', 'characters', 'act', 'stupidly', 'predictably', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'too', 'short', 'really', 'make', 'progress.Good', 'things', 'Monty', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fantastic', 'always', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'creative', 'well-varied', 'voice', 'acting', 'par', 'RVB', 'bit', 'weird', 'really', 'satisfying', 'characters', 'who', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'Weiss', 'starting', 'get', 'Ruby', 'then', 'being', 'really', 'resistant', 'style', 'leadership', 'fact', 'Ruby', 'only', 'kid', 'quickly', 'stop', 'doing', 'said', 'annoying', 'thing', 'world', 'interesting', 'so', 'far', 'several', 'stories', 'are', 'being', 'balanced', 'once', 'can', 'still', 'relate', 'most', 'characters', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'sometimes.So', 'still', 'good', 'might', 'be', 'while', 'heights', 'Red', 'vs.', 'Blue']",RWBY
1660229,AFUTQC0JS9K9G,B00DP4YC7U,Amazon Customer,"[4, 9]","I got hooked watching the pilot.The music is good and the trailers preceding the series are fantastic. At first I didn't really know what RWBY was.Granted, the animation is sub par with room for improvement. But, from what I know of RoosterTeeth, they don't have much staff and they are making each episode probably 2 weeks ahead of the air date. Even with the advanced 3D animation programs available, there is only so much that a small group of people can do in a small amount of time. Plus, they have Red vs Blue their working on at the same time.And, in my opinion, they really put in some dedication to the battle scenes which makes them super awesome! It closely makes up for the 'bland' episodes where the animation and acting is of poor quality.There is a lot of puns and references to older folklore as seen with the characters' names and their weapons. I'd suggest going to the rwby wikia to draw the parallels of them all. Fan fiction, I don't think so. Major influence definitely.Sadly, the episodes are so short that they don't even qualify for the 30-min slot for most cartoons on TV, aside from the pilot episode and episode 8 with the major battle against two Grim monsters. So, even including the as yet to be mentioned bonus material, I don't think it's worth buying a blu ray at the asking price, or even the DVD for that matter. My guess is that the bonus material would include the trailers and some behind-the-scene materials that would be more altogether than the episodes altogether.Maybe I would considerate it if each version respectively was half the price.

RWBY is subpar is almost every way.Plot and character development are nearly non-existent&#8212;though I guess that's to be expected when half the episodes are only five minutes long. Seriously, how can you ask $20+ for a 16-episode series when your longest episode doesn't even hit the 15-minute mark?The animators very clearly put most of their efforts into the admittedly good-looking action sequences. Everything else, however, is storyboard quality at best. A few snazzy fight scenes don't excuse constant clipping, lazy backgrounds, etc.The writing and the voice acting...I'm not even going to attempt to describe how painful they can get. I've watched dubbed anime, and I know not to expect too much from these sorts of things, but I also wasn't expecting RWBY to be so consistently dreadful.
