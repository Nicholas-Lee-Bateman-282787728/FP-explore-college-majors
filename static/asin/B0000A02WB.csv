760523,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B0000A02WB,Andrew Raker,"[7, 8]","Some of the many problems with this film:1. The criminals remind me of Bart and Burtha in Rusty, except that they are even more stupid. Yes, it is possible (unfortunately).2. The story line is incredibly weak. If you thought Home Alone 3 was weak and overly childish, well, this film is so much worse.3. Without pointing out any one actor, overall, each actor could have played his or her role better.4. The film contains so many inconsistencies. For example, when Kevin's mother suspects that something is wrong at the mansion, instead of calling the police, she drives (very irradically) on the highway from her home to Kevin's father's mansion. Any sensible mother would have called the police rather than risk her own life and that of her other children (who she took with her).5. The music in this film was nowhere near the quality of even Home Alone 3, let alone the first 2.Note: There is no reviewer conspiracy to cause this film to be rated very low. The film really was very badly created. I have not even started to list many of the minor problems I found with this film. Suffice to say, ""too many little holes can sink a large ship,"" and ""too many little problems in a film combined with three of four major ones, caused any film to sink very, very quickly.""",1,Zero Stars If I Could...,1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,1270,"['many', 'problems', 'film:1', 'criminals', 'remind', 'Bart', 'Burtha', 'Rusty', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'stupid', 'Yes', 'possible', 'unfortunately', '.2', 'story', 'line', 'incredibly', 'weak', 'thought', 'Home', 'Alone', '3', 'was', 'weak', 'overly', 'childish', 'well', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'worse.3', 'pointing', 'out', 'one', 'actor', 'overall', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'better.4', 'film', 'contains', 'so', 'many', 'inconsistencies', 'example', 'when', 'Kevin', 'mother', 'something', 'wrong', 'mansion', 'instead', 'calling', 'police', 'very', 'irradically', 'highway', 'home', 'Kevin', 'father', 'mansion', 'sensible', 'mother', 'would', 'have', 'called', 'police', 'rather', 'risk', 'own', 'life', 'other', 'children', 'who', 'took', '.5', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'nowhere', 'quality', 'even', 'Home', 'Alone', '3', 'let', 'alone', 'first', '2.Note', 'reviewer', 'conspiracy', 'cause', 'film', 'be', 'rated', 'very', 'low', 'film', 'really', 'was', 'very', 'badly', 'created', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'started', 'list', 'many', 'minor', 'problems', 'found', 'film', 'Suffice', 'say', 'too', 'many', 'little', 'holes', 'can', 'sink', 'large', 'ship', 'too', 'many', 'little', 'problems', 'film', 'combined', 'three', 'four', 'major', 'ones', 'caused', 'film', 'sink', 'very', 'very', 'quickly']",Home Alone 4 - Tv Mow

760525,A2TMJYY4ARPEGW,B0000A02WB,"CEagle2003 ""Tim""","[1, 2]","We have to give a very special applause to C. Columbus. He is the mastermind behind the first two ""Home Alone"" movies. ""Home Alone 3"" uses different characters plus a different cast. ""Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House"" uses the same characters as the first two, but all the characters are a different cast. M. Culkin does not even play Kevin. As I watched this movie on ABC Family Channel, I was putting myself in Culkin's spot, thinking how he would think as he would watch this. I noticed spots that M. Culkin would have said different things in the script. There were certain spots that I noticed that the real K. McCallister would have said something different and/or would not have ""put up with"" certain people. I will give one example. When K. McCallister in this movie, ""Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House,"" saw his arch-nemises, Marv, in the drive-way of his father's home/mansion (they are divorced now, his father and mother that is), K. McCallister (the one played by M. Culkin) would have done something similar to saying ""Here comes some more fun"" and raising and lowing his eyebrows a couple times. This K. McCallister instead runs to the buzzer to buzz for the butler for help, like a wimp. All I know is, in the first two ""Home Alone"" movies, K. McCallister was no wimp, and M. Calkin proved that.Lastly, Buzz and Megan, K. McCallister's older brother and sister are much younger in this film. Plus, the mother looks entirely different and the family (seen running around the house in the first two movies) was absent. I would strongly recommend that, if you still wish to watch this movie because you are a die-hard ""Home Alone"" fanatic like myself, keep an open-mind about it, otherwise it is just a waste of time, literally. My favorite of the four is ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York."" Remember this part?: ""Hold it right there!"" See if you can find that quote in ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" instead of watching this movie, it will be a better use of your time.Sorry this review was so long, but I thought I would give my readers a full in-depth detail of just what to expect from ""Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House.""",3,"Uses same character names, but not the same cast or director",1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2146,"['have', 'give', 'very', 'special', 'applause', 'C.', 'Columbus', 'mastermind', 'first', 'two', 'Home', 'Alone', 'movies', 'Home', 'Alone', '3', 'different', 'characters', 'different', 'cast', 'Home', 'Alone', '4', 'Taking', 'Back', 'House', 'same', 'characters', 'first', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'different', 'cast', 'M.', 'Culkin', 'not', 'even', 'play', 'Kevin', 'watched', 'movie', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Channel', 'was', 'putting', 'Culkin', 'spot', 'thinking', 'how', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'watch', 'noticed', 'spots', 'M.', 'Culkin', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'different', 'things', 'script', 'were', 'certain', 'spots', 'noticed', 'real', 'K.', 'McCallister', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'something', 'different', 'and/or', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'certain', 'people', 'will', 'give', 'one', 'example', 'When', 'K.', 'McCallister', 'movie', 'Home', 'Alone', '4', 'Taking', 'Back', 'House', 'saw', 'arch-nemises', 'Marv', 'drive-way', 'father', 'home/mansion', 'are', 'divorced', 'now', 'father', 'mother', 'K.', 'McCallister', 'one', 'played', 'M.', 'Culkin', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'similar', 'saying', 'Here', 'more', 'fun', 'raising', 'lowing', 'couple', 'times', 'K.', 'McCallister', 'instead', 'buzzer', 'buzz', 'butler', 'help', 'wimp', 'know', 'first', 'two', 'Home', 'Alone', 'movies', 'K.', 'McCallister', 'was', 'wimp', 'M.', 'Calkin', 'proved', 'that.Lastly', 'Buzz', 'Megan', 'K.', 'McCallister', 'older', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'much', 'younger', 'film', 'mother', 'entirely', 'different', 'family', 'seen', 'running', 'around', 'house', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'was', 'absent', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'still', 'wish', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Home', 'Alone', 'fanatic', 'keep', 'open-mind', 'otherwise', 'just', 'waste', 'time', 'literally', 'favorite', 'four', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'Lost', 'New', 'York', 'Remember', 'part', 'Hold', 'right', 'there', 'See', 'can', 'find', 'quote', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'Lost', 'New', 'York', 'instead', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'use', 'time.Sorry', 'review', 'was', 'so', 'long', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'readers', 'full', 'in-depth', 'detail', 'just', 'what', 'expect', 'Home', 'Alone', '4', 'Taking', 'Back', 'House']",Home Alone 4 - Tv Mow

This movie is a disgrace to the 1990 original and the 1992 sequel and even to 1997's &quot;Home Alone 3&quot;.Everything that came together on the first two in the series completely is rearranged and the timeline is altered but the result is totally disastrous on every level. Not even having one's brain turned off for a while is enough to make one enjoy this weak fourth edition.The acting is increidbly weak by everyone involved. Not to mention how they completely remade the McCallister family. The large extended family of Kevin was a riot to watch and although a bit obnoxious at times, it was funny watching Buzz get ticked off when he saw a bill for 986 dollars at the ending of the &quot;Lost In New York&quot; movie from 1992. &quot;Home Alone 4&quot; robs the family of all of it's charm by making them into just a nuclear family.Even the plot is utterly pointless with Kevin's parents spitting up and his father living with a new girlfriend at a rich mansion and Kevin stayign with him for Christmas but the mansion is robbed by would-be thieves but the slapstick jokes don't work on this movie. One scene is totally unrealistic where a faucet is left on to stop the thieves and the kitchen almost looks like an aquarium and is totally flooded. Hello! In real life, the water would just seep through cracks on the floors and walls and cause water damage to much of the structure. Plus it's impossible to turn a house into a human aquarium because the overflowing water would simply flood the room, and then the adjacent room and flow outside. You're house is far more likely to become totally filled with water if a flash flood occured (I.E. Hurricane or a large dam failed).The villain thieves are just incredibly devoid of any character and come off as being obnoxious, crass, petty and awfully stupid. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were perfect for playing Kevin's adversaries in the first two movies but whoever these clowns here who play them, their acting is weak and it sure looked like they were ready to leave the set.So this movie was a low-budget flick but even then, all of that money allotted into making this movie is utterly wasted in it's making. Whoever thought up of this should've looked at James Cameron's 1984 classic &quot;The Termintor&quot; to see how a low budget movie is made right!This movie is completely unworthy of one's time.

The first 2 (and a bit of the 3rd) movies also benefited from a very strong musical score that elevated them far beyond a typical family comedy. Home Alone 4 however has an extremely cheap score and feels rushed and empty.The very lean running time means there is no house full of traps, not a lot of plot to be wrapped up and no emotional pay-off. Plus, if I am correct in assuming Kevin's age in this film, this happens the same Xmas he was Lost in New York. So what's it to be? Dad's girlfriend's house or New York? Plus Marv is played by French Stewart (who didn't even bother to grow a beard for the part) and the rest of the cast is a bunch of unknowns. And it's obvious this was not filmed anywhere near winter, the lack of snow robs the film further of any Xmas-y feel it might have had. And what's with the constant, terrible ADR? It's very distracting.There were some funny parts to this film and the new kid playing Kevin did it well. But the hand-held camera thingy, the bare sets and lack of anything to do with Xmas make this film look like a poverty-stricken TV movie.The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen and has a mediocre Dolby 5.1 track.",3,"Funny, but lacks the punch of the others.",1068595200,"11 12, 2003",2003,1274,"['secret', 'many', 'despise', 'Home', 'Alone', '3', 'least', 'had', 'kind', 'technical', 'proffesionalism', 'first', '2', 'bit', '3rd', 'movies', 'also', 'benefited', 'very', 'strong', 'musical', 'score', 'elevated', 'far', 'typical', 'family', 'comedy', 'Home', 'Alone', '4', 'however', 'extremely', 'cheap', 'score', 'feels', 'rushed', 'empty.The', 'very', 'lean', 'running', 'time', 'house', 'full', 'traps', 'not', 'lot', 'plot', 'be', 'wrapped', 'up', 'emotional', 'pay-off', 'am', 'correct', 'assuming', 'Kevin', 'age', 'film', 'same', 'Xmas', 'was', 'Lost', 'New', 'York', 'So', 'what', 'be', 'Dad', 'girlfriend', 'house', 'New', 'York', 'Marv', 'played', 'French', 'Stewart', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'grow', 'beard', 'part', 'rest', 'cast', 'bunch', 'unknowns', 'obvious', 'was', 'not', 'filmed', 'anywhere', 'winter', 'lack', 'snow', 'robs', 'film', 'further', 'Xmas-y', 'feel', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'what', 'constant', 'terrible', 'ADR', 'very', 'distracting.There', 'were', 'funny', 'parts', 'film', 'new', 'kid', 'playing', 'Kevin', 'did', 'well', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'thingy', 'bare', 'sets', 'lack', 'anything', 'do', 'Xmas', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'poverty-stricken', 'TV', 'movie.The', 'DVD', '1.78:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'mediocre', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'track']",Home Alone 4 - Tv Mow

No big surprises, and no booby traps for the criminals.In short, this film is sad.  I love the first two Home Alone movies, and even though the third one mixed things up, it was good in its own way.

Why oh why oh why would you try to pull off a brand new set of cast as the same people that made the original box office hit's over ten years ago?The kid in this film looks nothing like the original Kevin Micalister, who resembles Culklin in now way, not to mention he's about 3 foot shorter, 2 pounds larger, and 10 times as less intelegent. Then they tried to pull off the parent's of the first 2, which look nothing like them either, nor did French Stewart trying to be Harry, who was original Daniel Sterns charactor.... they looked nothing like the originals, they didnt act anything like the originals, and why oh why would they even try to use the same name's of the charactors?If they had have given them new names, and try'd to pull this off as beeing a completly different fammily then the Macalisters, then it could have been an OK, 2 or 3 star movie. But when your sickend by whoever's idea it was to use the same name, and expect the audience to be dumb enough to go with it, then it get's 0 star's.YOU DO NOT TRY AND SELL A MOVIE AS BEEING THE SAME CHARACTORS AS THE ORIGINAL, IF THEY ARE NOT THE ORIGINALS, OR DONT EVEN RESEMBLE THE ORIGINAL ACTORSIf they beleive they have made a good movie here by using the original name's, then they might as well make a 5th seaqull to bury the franchise, and get a fully grown Chris Rock to play Kevin Macilster and Leslie Neilson to play the mother, Rosie O'Donnel can be the father, the brother can be played by the rapping granny from The Wedding Singer, and we can get a new guy to play the old man from part 1? hmmm.. maybe Jim Carey? they can expect the audience not to notice the diffrence in age appearence and persinalty to take your mind away from the bad casting arrangment's.the movie could have worked if it was maybe a different fammily name, and not supposed to be the same fammily as 1 and 2's..or maybe even if they made it a cartoon? But dont mess with classic, reciginised names and charactors and expect people to buy into it? Whoever had that idea made a very big mistake.... ignore the fact that there supposed to be the same fammily, and that the kid is supposed to be Maculy Culklin, and you still will see it's not a great movie anyway.

Personally, I thought it was pathetic. This was not so much the lack of Macaulay Culkin in the role of Kevin. I thought the new kid did an okay job. At least he could act.However, what completely and utterly ruined this for me was the use of French Stewart as Marv. Now, I'm sorry, but no one will ever equal Daniel Stern's performance as Harry's dopey sidekick. The facial expressions were hysterical, where French Stewart is a one-expression actor: squinty.That is all he seems to know how to do - squint. Perhaps it's a throwback to his days on 3rd Rock, but if they just had to try to cash in on the Home Alone franchise one more time, why, oh why did they have to choose Stewart as the bad guy?I'm sorry, I'm starting to rant.Moving on:The acting from the rest of cast is actually quite decent, and some of the stunts are funny enough to get some good laughs.The movie follows the typical Home Alone plot. Child is left alone, for whatever reason. Child uncovers dastardly plot. Child foils dastardly plot, employing various lethal techniques. Child makes friends with social outcast.

The only plus out of that was the 'automatic house' which Kevin so abley worked to his advantage.Disasters are aplenty in this movie, the same as with its three predecessors, but unless you're a devoted French Stewart fan, I'd recommend renting this one only.

760558,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000A02WB,Tsuyoshi,"[43, 45]","""Beethoven's 5th"" and ""Home Alone 4."" Back in the golden era of John Hughes, who was really something in the 80s, I couldn't imagine the day would come when we see his name in this direct-to-video sequels. Even if he only permitted to use (or recycle) the main characters, it is a shocking thing to witness this.But the film is made by 20th Century Fox, one of the major studios in Hollywood, and to be fair, the production designs are decent, Yes, Kevin McCallister is no longer played by Mr. Culkin, but kids all grow up someday. And look, Marv, one of the original burglars comes back to Kevin's house, but sorry, it is NOT Daniel Stern. (It's French Stewart, who is not bad).Some viewer, quite understandably, don't like the story about Kevin's parents who live separately, but it could be OK. Today that is not a rare thing. Some viewers again don't like the idea of different actors playing the main characters, but hey, that happened to James Bond or Dumbledore, and we didn't care.[THE REAL PROBLEM ] is this. This time Marv doesn't steal. Why? For he needs money so desperately that he and his girlfriend (Missi Pyle) decide to kidnap Prince. I mean it, THE PRINCE, a child of the royal family. But from where? The big mansion of Kevin's Daddy's girlfriend. But how? Oh, this is a big surprise, but there's an insider. And what happens? Many slapsticks, many of them just unfunny.But the most embarrassing is Kevin, the kid himself. Sorry but I must tell you. The character of Kevin is really awful, even offensive. Kevin not only frustrates the burglars' plans by booby traps (so far, fine); he also enjoys doing it! If you don't see what I am trying to say, see the scenes in which Kevin, sitting on a sofa, sees French Stewart and Missi Pyle literally trapped in the rotating bookshelf, which goes round and round, faster and faster. See how the boy laughs, like watching a movie on TV! Yes, he laughs with loud voice as if he's one of the Warner Brothers' animation characters. I saw all the `Home Alone' series, but this is the first time I really wished that the burglars would win and take everything away. They surely deserve that.I thought `Home Alone 3' was enough. John Hughes and other people did think otherwise. Now I think `Home Alone 4' is truly enough, and really hope that they think the same way.",1,"Weak Story, Unfunny Humor, and The Boy: Everything Is So Misguided",1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,2324,"['Beethoven', '5th', 'Home', 'Alone', '4', 'Back', 'golden', 'era', 'John', 'Hughes', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'something', '80s', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'day', 'would', 'come', 'when', 'see', 'name', 'direct-to-video', 'sequels', 'Even', 'only', 'permitted', 'use', 'recycle', 'main', 'characters', 'shocking', 'thing', 'witness', 'film', 'made', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'one', 'major', 'studios', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'fair', 'production', 'designs', 'are', 'decent', 'Yes', 'Kevin', 'McCallister', 'no', 'longer', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Culkin', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'someday', 'look', 'Marv', 'one', 'original', 'burglars', 'back', 'Kevin', 'house', 'sorry', 'NOT', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'French', 'Stewart', 'who', 'not', 'bad', '.Some', 'viewer', 'quite', 'understandably', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'story', 'Kevin', 'parents', 'who', 'live', 'separately', 'could', 'be', 'OK.', 'Today', 'not', 'rare', 'thing', 'viewers', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea', 'different', 'actors', 'playing', 'main', 'characters', 'hey', 'happened', 'James', 'Bond', 'Dumbledore', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', '[', 'REAL', 'PROBLEM', ']', 'time', 'Marv', ""n't"", 'steal', 'Why', 'money', 'so', 'desperately', 'girlfriend', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'decide', 'kidnap', 'Prince', 'mean', 'PRINCE', 'child', 'royal', 'family', 'where', 'big', 'mansion', 'Kevin', 'Daddy', 'girlfriend', 'how', 'Oh', 'big', 'surprise', 'insider', 'what', 'Many', 'slapsticks', 'many', 'just', 'unfunny.But', 'most', 'embarrassing', 'Kevin', 'kid', 'Sorry', 'must', 'tell', 'character', 'Kevin', 'really', 'awful', 'even', 'offensive', 'Kevin', 'not', 'only', 'burglars', 'plans', 'booby', 'traps', 'so', 'far', 'fine', 'also', 'doing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'am', 'trying', 'say', 'see', 'scenes', 'Kevin', 'sitting', 'sofa', 'French', 'Stewart', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'literally', 'trapped', 'rotating', 'bookshelf', 'round', 'round', 'faster', 'faster', 'See', 'how', 'boy', 'watching', 'movie', 'TV', 'Yes', 'loud', 'voice', 'one', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'animation', 'characters', 'saw', 'Home', 'Alone', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'wished', 'burglars', 'would', 'win', 'take', 'everything', 'away', 'surely', 'deserve', 'that.I', 'thought', 'Home', 'Alone', '3', 'was', 'enough', 'John', 'Hughes', 'other', 'people', 'did', 'think', 'otherwise', 'Now', 'think', 'Home', 'Alone', '4', 'truly', 'enough', 'really', 'hope', 'think', 'same', 'way']",Home Alone 4 - Tv Mow
