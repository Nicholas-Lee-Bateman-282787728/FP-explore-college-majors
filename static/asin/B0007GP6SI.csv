That was $5.50 well spent because I was not disappointed. This movie is funny at times, sad at times, thought-provoking at times, but entertaining at all times. I actually cried at the end. I can't remember the last movie I watched that brought tears to my eyes. Anyhoo, I turned my ringer off so I wouldn't be disturbed. If you like ""30 Years To Life"" you'll like this movie too. The main reason I like this movie is because the characters are so real: the drunk who puts somebody on blast at the family gathering, the ""Oreo"" friend (black on the outside, white on the inside), the ""Ms. Independent-I-Don't-Need-No-Man-I-Got-Dental-Benefits-and-my-own-business"" female, the angry one who has that inner turmoil but is taking it out on everybody else, the so- called ""Mack"" who fronts like he's ""The Man"" when he's really on lock, the ""We-need-to-take-this-relationship-to-another-level"" one,(marriage) and the loud sister, the one who keeps the party going no matter what  (Wendy Raquel Robinson). The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that in some scenes women were referred to as ""b-----s"" and ""h--s."" Anyway, Guy Torry is an outstanding actor, he acted his heiny off in this one. His character is the one that stood out. But don't take my word for it, take a chance like I did and see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.",5,This is a good  movie....,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,1438,"[""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'Walmart', 'took', 'chance', 'bought', 'was', '5.50', 'well', 'spent', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'funny', 'times', 'sad', 'times', 'thought-provoking', 'times', 'entertaining', 'times', 'actually', 'cried', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'movie', 'watched', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Anyhoo', 'turned', 'ringer', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'disturbed', 'like', '30', 'Years', 'Life', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'too', 'main', 'reason', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'drunk', 'who', 'somebody', 'blast', 'family', 'gathering', 'Oreo', 'friend', 'black', 'outside', 'white', 'inside', 'Ms.', ""Independent-I-Don't-Need-No-Man-I-Got-Dental-Benefits-and-my-own-business"", 'female', 'angry', 'one', 'who', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'taking', 'out', 'everybody', 'else', 'so-', 'called', 'Mack', 'who', 'fronts', 'Man', 'when', 'really', 'lock', 'We-need-to-take-this-relationship-to-another-level', 'one', 'marriage', 'loud', 'sister', 'one', 'who', 'party', 'going', 'matter', 'what', 'Wendy', 'Raquel', 'Robinson', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'scenes', 'women', 'were', 'referred', 'b', '-s', 'h', 's.', 'Anyway', 'Guy', 'Torry', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'acted', 'heiny', 'off', 'one', 'character', 'one', 'stood', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'word', 'take', 'chance', 'did', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",With or Without You
