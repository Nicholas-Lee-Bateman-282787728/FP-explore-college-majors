It intrigued me to see these hippie characters who really were not cops but assisted them.  As the years went on the show was not on anymore and other shows came along.  I happen to love police drama tv shows and I suddenly remembered this one. Vi looked it up and found it.

Hornaday,"[12, 16]","Love and loss are highlighted in the latest release of The Mod Squad in a half-season DVD boxed set.Thirteen episodes, representing the first half of the Second Season of the Classic TV iconic police drama, are expected to be included, along with additional features and interviews to be announced.The Mod Squad is the original counter-culture phenomenon that remains a favorite, replete with one of the best and most memorable TV musical themes ever composed. It is remarkably watchable despite its age - ironically, now older than young people of that era were warned never to trust in adults.Premiering Sept. 24, 1968, during the height of the Vietnam War, The Mod Squad lasted five action-packed seasons with episodes that dealt as much with social issues as it did crime in the streets.Set in Los Angeles, the premiss was simple enough: Three young people in trouble with the law  were given the opportunity to avoid jail sentences by infiltrating the counter-culture as undercover cops and exposing criminals who prey on youth by bridging the generation gap between the youth and the ""fuzz.""The three ""delinquents"" were Pete Cochran,(Michael Cole) who was arrested for car theft; Julie Barnes, (Peggy Lipton) who ran away from her prostitute mother in San Francisco; and Lincoln Hayes, (Clarence Williams III) who was arrested during the Watts riots. Tough talking Capt. Adam Greer, (Tige Andrews) was in charge of the special squad and eventually became a father-figure to them. (Lipton, who later played Norma the waitress in another cult classic -  Twin Peaks -  was nominated for an Emmy for her role as Julie, and won a Golden Globe in 1970 for her portrayal of the character.)In the series, Cochran drove an old green ""woody"" side-paneled 1950 Mercury station wagon with two surf boards on top that became a lasting symbol of the show, along with cooooool bell-bottomed pants! Sadly, the wheels were destroyed in this second season when the car was set ablaze by an arsonist. (The Woody was wrecked in Ep. 35, ""The Death of Wild Bill Hannacheck,"" which is included in this boxed set. At the end, the Squad stands and watches their ""old buddy"" burn. Linc has the classic line ""Good bye olde paint."" During the Reunion movie in 1979, Pete is rich so he buys a Woody when the three of them unite once more.)The stellar series spawned a block-buster movie in the 1990's that was horrible by comparison, failing in all respects to capture the chemistry and remarkably innocent sincerity of the original.Episodes expected to be included in this DVD set, with their original airdates and brief description are: The Girl in Chair Nine (9/23/1969), the Squad befriends a young mother; My Name is Manolette (9/30/1969), the Squad ""adopts"" a nine-year-old boy; An Eye for an Eye (10/7/1969), Capt. Greer falls in love unaware that he puts the woman in danger; Ride the Man Down (10/14/1969), Pete is framed for murder; To Linc - With Love (10/21/1969), Linc falls in love; Lisa (11/4/1969), the squad helps a woman with a split personality; Confrontation! (11/11/1969), racial strife and murder at a college; Willie Poor Boy (11/18/1969), Pete helps an illiterate boy accused of robbery; The Death of Bill Hannachek (11/25/1969), Julie poses as a country western singer; A Place to Run, A Heart to Hide In (12/2/1969), the Squad pose as college students to investigate a murder; The Healer (12/9/1969), the Squad investigate a faith healer after a patient dies; In this Corner - Sol Albert (12/16/1969), the Squad try to find a slum landlord; and Never Give the Fuzz an Even Break (12/23/1969), the Squad try to catch a con man with a con.Created by the legendary TV mogul Aaron Spelling, he produced it along with Danny Thomas and Sheldon Leonard. Harve Bennett replaced Spelling in later seasons. Hopefully, the remained of the series will soon be released.",5,The COOL Returns,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,3860,"['Love', 'loss', 'are', 'highlighted', 'latest', 'release', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'half-season', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set.Thirteen', 'episodes', 'representing', 'first', 'half', 'Second', 'Season', 'Classic', 'TV', 'iconic', 'police', 'drama', 'are', 'expected', 'be', 'included', 'additional', 'features', 'interviews', 'be', 'announced.The', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'original', 'counter-culture', 'phenomenon', 'favorite', 'replete', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'memorable', 'TV', 'musical', 'themes', 'ever', 'composed', 'remarkably', 'watchable', 'age', 'ironically', 'now', 'older', 'young', 'people', 'era', 'were', 'warned', 'never', 'trust', 'adults.Premiering', 'Sept.', '24', '1968', 'height', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'lasted', 'five', 'action-packed', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'dealt', 'much', 'social', 'issues', 'did', 'crime', 'streets.Set', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'premiss', 'was', 'simple', 'enough', 'Three', 'young', 'people', 'trouble', 'law', 'were', 'given', 'opportunity', 'avoid', 'jail', 'sentences', 'infiltrating', 'counter-culture', 'undercover', 'cops', 'exposing', 'criminals', 'who', 'prey', 'youth', 'bridging', 'generation', 'gap', 'youth', 'fuzz', 'three', 'delinquents', 'were', 'Pete', 'Cochran', 'Michael', 'Cole', 'who', 'was', 'arrested', 'car', 'theft', 'Julie', 'Barnes', 'Peggy', 'Lipton', 'who', 'ran', 'away', 'prostitute', 'mother', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Lincoln', 'Hayes', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'who', 'was', 'arrested', 'Watts', 'riots', 'talking', 'Capt', 'Adam', 'Greer', 'Tige', 'Andrews', 'was', 'charge', 'special', 'squad', 'eventually', 'became', 'father-figure', 'Lipton', 'who', 'later', 'played', 'Norma', 'waitress', 'cult', 'classic', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'was', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'role', 'Julie', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', '1970', 'portrayal', 'character', 'series', 'Cochran', 'drove', 'old', 'green', 'woody', 'side-paneled', '1950', 'Mercury', 'station', 'wagon', 'two', 'surf', 'boards', 'top', 'became', 'lasting', 'symbol', 'show', 'cooooool', 'bell-bottomed', 'pants', 'Sadly', 'wheels', 'were', 'destroyed', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'car', 'was', 'set', 'ablaze', 'arsonist', 'Woody', 'was', 'wrecked', 'Ep', '35', 'Death', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hannacheck', 'included', 'boxed', 'set', 'end', 'Squad', 'stands', 'watches', 'old', 'buddy', 'burn', 'Linc', 'classic', 'line', 'Good', 'bye', 'olde', 'paint', 'Reunion', 'movie', '1979', 'Pete', 'rich', 'so', 'Woody', 'when', 'three', 'unite', 'once', 'more', 'stellar', 'series', 'spawned', 'block-buster', 'movie', '1990', 'was', 'horrible', 'comparison', 'failing', 'respects', 'capture', 'chemistry', 'remarkably', 'innocent', 'sincerity', 'original.Episodes', 'expected', 'be', 'included', 'DVD', 'set', 'original', 'airdates', 'brief', 'description', 'are', 'Girl', 'Chair', 'Nine', '9/23/1969', 'Squad', 'young', 'mother', 'Name', 'Manolette', '9/30/1969', 'Squad', 'adopts', 'nine-year-old', 'boy', 'Eye', 'Eye', '10/7/1969', 'Capt', 'Greer', 'love', 'unaware', 'woman', 'danger', 'Ride', 'Man', 'Down', '10/14/1969', 'Pete', 'framed', 'murder', 'Linc', 'Love', '10/21/1969', 'Linc', 'love', 'Lisa', '11/4/1969', 'squad', 'woman', 'split', 'personality', 'Confrontation', '11/11/1969', 'racial', 'strife', 'murder', 'college', 'Willie', 'Poor', 'Boy', '11/18/1969', 'Pete', 'illiterate', 'boy', 'accused', 'robbery', 'Death', 'Bill', 'Hannachek', '11/25/1969', 'Julie', 'country', 'western', 'singer', 'Place', 'Run', 'A', 'Heart', 'Hide', '12/2/1969', 'Squad', 'pose', 'college', 'students', 'investigate', 'murder', 'Healer', '12/9/1969', 'Squad', 'investigate', 'faith', 'healer', 'patient', 'dies', 'Corner', 'Sol', 'Albert', '12/16/1969', 'Squad', 'try', 'find', 'slum', 'landlord', 'Never', 'Give', 'Fuzz', 'Even', 'Break', '12/23/1969', 'Squad', 'try', 'catch', 'con', 'man', 'con.Created', 'legendary', 'TV', 'mogul', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'produced', 'along', 'Danny', 'Thomas', 'Sheldon', 'Leonard', 'Harve', 'Bennett', 'replaced', 'Spelling', 'later', 'seasons', 'Hopefully', 'remained', 'series', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'released']","The Mod Squad - Season 2, Volume 1"

Now it is back and on DVD. At least the first two season have made it and that looks like this all we will ever see. Season two was a very strong season for the show and I would highly recommend this season to any fan of the show. High quality restoration with excellent sound quality are the highlights of this set. The DVD case is very solid sturdy and colorful and really protects the disc well. I would get this set now before it once again fades into obscurity.
