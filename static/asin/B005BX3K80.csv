I actually bought this video for my ""easy days"" since I've been doing 4 and 5 mile dvds with Leslie for a long time, but using the weights really pumps it up!  Plus I love it when Leslie is by herself in her videos.  She is much more focused, and she stays on topic more than when she is with all of her friends.  For those of you who like it when she has a big group to chat with, this might not be the dvd for you.Another reviewer mentioned that Leslie seems overly cautious about the weights, and that is true.  She mentions a LOT that you shouldn't swing the weights around, don't over do it, put them down if you are too tired.  It was almost a bit much, and made her look really fearful of being sued.  But overall, she was the same happy chatty Leslie that her fans know and love.If you're looking for a way to tone up some arm muscles while you walk and to get some extra sweat time in, this might be the one for you!",5,Go Leslie!,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,979,"['WOW', 'Who', 'knew', '3', 'miles', 'could', 'make', 'sweat', 'so', 'much', 'actually', 'bought', 'video', 'easy', 'days', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', '4', '5', 'mile', 'dvds', 'Leslie', 'long', 'time', 'using', 'weights', 'really', 'pumps', 'up', 'love', 'when', 'Leslie', 'herself', 'videos', 'much', 'more', 'focused', 'topic', 'more', 'when', 'friends', 'who', 'when', 'big', 'group', 'chat', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'dvd', 'you.Another', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'Leslie', 'overly', 'cautious', 'weights', 'true', 'LOT', 'should', ""n't"", 'swing', 'weights', 'do', ""n't"", 'over', 'do', 'put', 'down', 'are', 'too', 'tired', 'was', 'almost', 'bit', 'much', 'made', 'look', 'really', 'fearful', 'being', 'sued', 'overall', 'was', 'same', 'happy', 'chatty', 'Leslie', 'fans', 'know', 'love.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'way', 'tone', 'up', 'arm', 'muscles', 'walk', 'get', 'extra', 'sweat', 'time', 'might', 'be', 'one']",Leslie Sansone: Burn Body Fat

1452962,A3LKP6WPMP9UKX,B005BX3K80,Anna V. Carroll,"[9, 9]","In March of this year (2013) I wasn't feeling great & went to see a doctor. Something I haven't done in years. He examined me and didn't mince words. I was a mess. Well, I AM 71! No excuse for being in this shape. My blood pressure was 222 over 100. ""Is that bad?"" I asked. ""Uh, you're in stroke territory"", he answered. Unfortunately, he found LOTS of things wrong with me. So much so he sent me to a specialist. The specialist told me he would have to do surgery, but couldn't because my blood pressure was so high (among other things). He sent me to three other physicians to check out every part of my body. Not good.It is now June and my blood pressure is normal (thanks to medication), I have lost 7 pounds and work out with Leslie Sansone EVERY SINGLE DAY!One of my doctors has put me on a strict diet of healthy foods and cut out bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, cola drinks, dairy (yogurt-milk-ice cream)and everything I love.  The first two weeks I cried for hours. The doctors (all of them) told me they were worried I wouldn't be motivated to change, much less exercise. Then I remembered an old VHS tape I had of Leslie Sansone. Probably her first one.I went on-line to amazon.com and ordered Older Adults Walk & Firm. Day after day I did the exercises. Now, after two months, I have graduated to this DVD. And boy, is it working! There is a 1 mile, 2 mile and 3 mile portion. You choose which one you feel you can do. For a week or two I did the 15 minute one mile with weights. (I use 2 lbs on each hand) Tonight I did the 2 mile (with weights) and am floating in a pool of water (sweat) around my feet. It's 85 right now (10:27PM) so I had to be careful. I do the exercises early in the morning when it is cooler or late at night when the temperature has dropped.The music on this DVD is great. It really motivates me to keep on kickin' and movin'! She is adorable. She looks like your neighbor or one of your kid's friends mother. She isn't super thin or Jane Fonda.  She is an inspiration to me and I feel like she is my personal coach!  Two days ago I ran into a neighbor who asked me if I had been dieting. ""Leslie Sansone,"" I replied. She just gave me a strange look and said, ""Uh, sure."" My summer pants are fitting so much better than last year. Or the year before.I cannot have the operation(s) until Sept. By then I will have dropped some of the 25 lbs. (or all of it) and will be in great health. Don't ever let your body get so out of shape that you can't have an operation! I was stunned at the news of how much trouble I was in health-wise. You simply MUST exercise. I don't even have a TV! I spend too much time on my computer. Too much time downloading movies. All that is behind me. When I am on the PC it is because I am playing Leslie Sansone's dvds and exercising!I am giving her full credit for turning me around. Without her great workouts and great spirit egging me on, there is no way I will be in shape come Sept. Thank you, Ms. Sansone, for saving my life!!!  Love you to death!UPDATE: November 2013 On the day of my surgery in late Sept. I had lost close to 20 pounds! The operation was a huge strain on every part of my body and it took me 5 full weeks to recover, but I am now in great shape. All this thanks to my daily exercising with Leslie Sansone and eating sensibly for a change. I just resumed my exercise routine and feel a twinge of pain here and there, but I am happy to be back on track. It would have taken me months more to lose the weight and get in shape for the surgery if I had not found this DVD.

1452973,AGAOZ53UU82G7,B005BX3K80,FashionQueen86,"[3, 3]","**Pros**1) When you view the menu screen, it's broken into separate miles. You got One Mile, Two Miles, and then Three Miles. But it also gives you the choice to either do her workouts the normal way, or do her workouts to where you only hear the music and not her voice. I did music only for her 2-mile one and it was so awkward watching her talk but hearing only the music. Plus I don't know how much help that'd be as you miss your step, trying to read her mouth to guess when she'll stop or start the next move.2) She does not kill you with the weight lifting. She's very pleasant with the arms and the pace of the workout and will encourage you to take a break from it if you need to.3) Each Mile has it's own length of time, meaning she does not stick Mile one from Mile One level and combine that with Mile two level, etc. Each level is actually their own thing. So you're not bored with looking at the same mile one for all levels.**Cons**1)Almost all of her music is recycled from the DVD 'Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk'. I'm really BIG with music. I LOVE music, but when she uses the same songs, it makes me feel like I didn't buy anything different from the last purchase. But I have to give her some credit because there must be a reason as to why she continues to use the same songs. Even she may be tired of it.2) She's alone. I usually like when she's with people. It just gives you more personality, more to look at/observe, maybe even more distraction. I find her too lonely when she's alone.3)It only gives you a countdown clock on Mile one level. For whatever reason it disappears for the last two levels. But it is on the back of the DVD case. HOWEVER, even though in total it says 101 minutes, the minutes seem a little off. For example Level Mile One says 19 minutes, but it's really 15 or 17. Level Mile three says about 48 minutes when it's really like 45. But just in case I'm wrong and the workout is a total of 101 minutes, If you do the entire DVD in a day, I think you burn like 470 calories. At leas that's what My calorie counter profile says.4)The music also changes up quickly only for the Mile 3. It doesn't finish fully. It's like they wanted to stick a bunch of songs in the last mile. I guess this really would not be a pro or con, but usually two full songs equals one mile done.

1452976,A1XJ3M3JTMD3HZ,B005BX3K80,Honest,"[53, 63]","I was stuck  between a 3 and a 4 so I decided to round down.I'll go workout by workout for clarity's sake.Surprisingly, the 1 mile workout, I feel, was the best one. It was 15 minutes long and begins with a moderately-paced warm-up with one of my all-time favorite Leslie Sansone songs. Even in this warm-up, she has on 1-lb hand weights. A little more than 4  minutes in, it speeds up to another common song that she uses in the first mile of her 5-mile Fat-Burning walk. She uses the basic combination of side-steps (no doubles in this one), kicks and knee-lifts. The last 5 minutes ends with another song from the 4th mile of her 5-mile Fat-Burning walk that is a tad quicker and at that point, Leslie adds in a pair of 2-lb. wrist weights to make a total of 3-lbs. on each arm. The cool-down goes back to the mellow song that the walk starts with and it is only about a minute-and-a-half. Leslie does a very quick stretch (literally a few seconds) and the workout ends. Leslie is less chatty than normal on this one.The reason that I call this mile the best one is because it follows a format that I wish Leslie would follow in all her videos. Instead of slowing down before the mile is complete (like she usually does), she carries out the fast pace through the end of the mile and then slower cool-down pace doesn't come in until the mile is complete.On to the 2 mile workout...the warm-up stars with Leslie using the 2-lb hand weights. She goes over the basic steps and lets us know that this mile is going to offer a 15 minute mile pace. After that, Leslie speeds up with another song from the 5-mile Fat-Burning workout and almost immediately integrates the weights with overhead presses. Throughout the rest of the 1st mile, she does moves like kickbacks with a bicep curl and knee-lift series (single and double), double side-steps and ""power kicks"". She repeats that you can always put the weights down if they are too much.The second mile begins with a song she uses in other videos to do boosted walking, although she does not boost on this workout. She presents other moves like ""tap-outs"" and bicep curls that extend into triceps kickbacks. She also notes that it is okay to slide the weights onto the forearms to give the hands a break from gripping. At the second song (my second all-time LS favorite), she takes off the 2-lb. weights and switches to 1-lb weights but notes that you can totally eradicate the use of the weights at the point if you wish. She introduces the grapevine into this section. She ends the workout with a much slower song, taking the weights away but pretty much keeping with the standard moves. She also takes the time to let the audience know that if they're fat, not to feel bad because technology helped facilitate it and to not skip meals. A little more chatty in this one. A two minute extra slow pace officially ends the 2-mile walk at around 32 minutes and then she walks a little more before the stretch.I feel the disadvantage to this workout is the fact that it slows down so noticeably before the 2 mile mark is reached.Lastly, the 3-mile walk...this one started out okay. She started with the 1-lb weights throughout the warm-up and lets us know the weights won't be used throughout the whole thing because it's a long workout and she wants to avoid overuse. Again, this begins with the standard at-home walking moves. She again speeds it up with a few songs from her 5-mile Fat-Burning walk (my third all-time LS favorite is the third song of the first mile) and uses moves such as the traveling side-steps and kickbacks with overhead press. The first mile is about 15:30 (although it doesn't seem like it).In the second mile, she switches to 2-lb hand weights. The music is more brisk. She continues with the standard overhead press and kickback/bicep curl combo. Then a gospel-type song plays that is very brisk and kind of delightful. Unfortunately, that was the climax of this workout. After that, she turns to her ""boosted"" walking song from the 5-mile Fat-Burning walk. She does do a move where she is walking while doing chest presses and eventually boosts for a few seconds.The last mile, she appears with 3-lbs. worth of hand weights on each arm. The music gets so slow, it's intolerable. Then, after about a minute-and-a-half, it speeds up to that dreadful ""Everybody"" song from 4 Fast Miles. As an aside, I can't stand that song. But, if that wasn't bad enough, every minute-and-a-half the song changes and it is a total motivation killer. I think her aim was to alternate slower songs with not as slow songs but it totally bored me to no end. I was at the point where I was wondering when it would end. This cycle goes on for about 6 or 7 songs and then she finally drifts on into the cool down. At least she ends this workout with my first all-time favorite LS song.I felt this workout was unfortunate because up through the gospel-style song, she was on track for a good workout. Even the boosted walking song was okay but that stunt she pulled in the last mile with the bipolar DJ mix was where she went wrong for me. She does do a more substantial stretch in this one than the other two.A plus to this overall DVD is that all workouts have a music-only option. I would probably recommend doing a hybrid of all three workouts to get the most bang for your buck. Start out with the one mile, before the cool down switch to the second mile of the three mile walk and finish with the last mile of the two mile walk.",3,Pretty Standard,1327449600,"01 25,
