He tries to be a writer, but isn't having any luck actually writing anything. One day he meets an old man and they quickly become friends. The man gives him a manuscript to read, which he said he wrote, called A Murder of Crows. It's brilliant. When Lawson goes to return it, he discovers that the man has died from an apparent heart attack. With no known family, he decides to keep the manuscript, place his name on it, and submit it to a publisher. It's an instant success, but he's arrested for murder when a detective reads the book and recognizes the descriptions as being of murders that were actually committed. He realizes that the details in the book would only be known by the actual killer. Obviously, we know that Lawson didn't commit the murders, but who did? That's what this movie is about.

The script by Herrington is absolutely involving.  It's detailed, well paced, and very smart.  Despite a few goofy or cheesy lines, which are pretty much due to bad acting in certain parts, the script is solid.The direction is as haunting as it should be in this type of film and Herrington really turns up the suspense.  His slow shots or disoriated handhelds are in the right places, and it only adds to the tenseness of the story.Cuba Gooding Jr. is completely fascinating in this role.  He gets into it all the way and makes you believe him, even in the most incredible scenes.  Tom Berrenger, however, does not fare as well.  Even though he proved in the past that he was a decent actor, he slips a bit, and some of his lines are given like he was reading them off of cue cards.  However, he's good enough that it doesn't distract from anything else, and in some scenes, he's excellent.  The supporting cast, including Marianne Jean Baptiste and Eric Stoltz, is very good and only adds to the film.  Stoltz is smarmy and oozes charisma and Baptiste has a very soothing, sweet, grandmother-type air about her.  They are the best they could be.Overall, A MURDER OF CROWS is a highly overlooked film that should be scene by lovers of suspense.

464858,A1U360OMVQRPUB,6305432260,Mel Odom,"[2, 2]","Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays Russell Lawson, a black defense attorney in present day New Orleans, Louisiana.  The film opens on Lawson, who is having an epiphany regarding his perception of his job and the people he defends.  The camera picks up a red-faced devil walking deliberately through the Mardi Gras-packed streets and the metro party that is in full swing.  The devil pays a visit to Lawson, pulling out a pistol and preparing to kill him when he hears Lawson tell the judge that he wants to pull out of the current case he's trying.  Thurman Parks III, Lawson's client, only that afternoon admitted that he killed the lap dancer he's accused of murdering.  The next day, Lawson destroys his legal career, throws away his future, and crucifies his client on the witness stand.  In only a short time, Lawson is a fishing charter captain in Florida.  He meets an old man who gives him a novel about the murders of five attorneys who used their skills to help killers go free.  Later that day, the old man turns up dead.  Having what he is certain is a bestselling novel, Lawson rewrites the book, claims it is his own, and becomes an overnight sensation and millionaire.  Then he's arrested because the murders in the novel were all based on the murders of prominent attorneys.  Lawson becomes part of a cunning cat-and-mouse chase that keeps the viewer glued to his or her seat.Cuba Gooding, Jr. has been in dozens of movies and has been an outstanding actor.  Writer/Director Rowdy Herrington has also written STRIKING DISTANCE and ROAD HOUSE, both action flicks known for cunning little plotting loops.  Although only in the movie for a short time and never completely living up to his past potential, Tom Berenger plays the NOPD homicide cop that chases Lawson down.  Eric Stoltz plays the positively smarmy lap dancer murderer.A MURDER OF CROWS stands out as a suspenseful thriller.  Enough twists and turns exist within the movie to keep even the most jaded thriller fan on the edge of his or her seat.  Conventional double-crosses only set the viewer up for plot twists and turns that throw monkeywrenches in even the astute thriller fan's pre-conceptions of how the movie is going to turn out.  Although the acting performances are good, the thing that really drives the movie is the plot.  The action is tight and the pacing moves along quickly.  The literary and philosophy clues will catch the eye of a student of both or either, and plays fairly with the viewer on those accounts.One aspect of the film and the plot that rankles somewhat is the fact that the ultimate villain is completely hidden from view.  Also, Lawson's ability to move around in plain daylight while a massive manhunt was underway for him takes an effort to suspend the disbelief.  How Lawson and Dubose linked up would have been nice to see because that came out of left field at one point.  The movie was more about the plot twists and turns than about the way Lawson survived financially, but those aspects would have tightened up the viewing experience a little.A MURDER OF CROWS is great movie for the thriller/suspense fan who likes a little whodunit? in his or her viewing experience.

Not awful, but not great, either. Lawson Russell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is a recently-disbarred lawyer who got the ax after recusing himself from the trial of Thurman Parks III (Eric Stoltz), a slimeball even Russell can't bring himself to defend. A year later, low on cash and running a fishing boat in the Florida Keys, working on his perpetually-unfinished novel, he meets an old man with the improbable name of Christopher Marlowe who wants him to read over a manuscript. He goes to return it the next day and finds the old man has died of a heart attack, so Russell appropriates the manuscript, which of course becomes a smash success-- after which Rusell becomes the target of obsessive-cop stereotype Clifford Dubose (Tom Berenger), because all the murders in the book Russell appropriated really happened, and now he's the prime suspect. I'm pretty sure you can figure out what happens from there.It's mildly amusing, and good acting is turned in by Stoltz, Gooding, and Berenger, though they have little to do other than play cardboard cutouts. Ashley Laurence also shows up as Gooding's publisher, and any excuse to see Ashley Laurence on a screen is worth your time; it's got an empty-calories feel to it, however, and a few days after seeing it, you're likely to start wondering if you remember certain details (say, for example, the entire last half-hour of the film) correctly. ** ",3,Formulaic.,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,1541,"['Murder', 'Crows', 'Rowdy', 'Herrington', '1999', 'Herrington', 'best', 'known', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'vehicle', 'Road', 'House', 'by-the-numbers', 'thriller', 'here', 'Not', 'awful', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'Lawson', 'Russell', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'recently-disbarred', 'lawyer', 'who', 'got', 'ax', 'recusing', 'trial', 'Thurman', 'Parks', 'III', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'slimeball', 'even', 'Russell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'defend', 'year', 'later', 'low', 'cash', 'running', 'fishing', 'boat', 'Florida', 'Keys', 'working', 'perpetually-unfinished', 'novel', 'old', 'man', 'improbable', 'name', 'Christopher', 'Marlowe', 'who', 'read', 'manuscript', 'return', 'next', 'day', 'old', 'man', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'so', 'Russell', 'manuscript', 'course', 'smash', 'success', 'Rusell', 'target', 'obsessive-cop', 'stereotype', 'Clifford', 'Dubose', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'murders', 'book', 'Russell', 'appropriated', 'really', 'happened', 'now', 'prime', 'suspect', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'there.It', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'good', 'acting', 'turned', 'Stoltz', 'Gooding', 'Berenger', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'other', 'play', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'Ashley', 'Laurence', 'also', 'up', 'Gooding', 'publisher', 'excuse', 'see', 'Ashley', 'Laurence', 'screen', 'time', 'got', 'empty-calories', 'feel', 'however', 'few', 'days', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'likely', 'start', 'wondering', 'remember', 'certain', 'details', 'say', 'example', 'entire', 'last', 'half-hour', 'film', 'correctly', '**']",N/A

Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[4, 5]","It is an unfortunate fact that many mystery writers, of both novels and screenplays, are often far better at concocting a great set-up, the perfect crime as it were, than they are at resolving the story in any realistic or believable way.  This movie is another similarly unfortunate example.If all one read was the synopsis -a man is given a manuscript for which he falsely takes credit, but which details crimes for which he is subsequently charged after he has destroyed all evidence to the contrary- it sounds good.  A classic locked room mystery.  The problems here are both the telling of the larger story and the resolution.  The beginning of the story is muddied with both unnecessary characters and exposition, for little of it actually matters once the trap is sprung on Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s character...and that only happens after he is taken in by a series of characters wearing disguises so bad that they'd not pass muster in a high school play.  Unbelievably escaping the police in both New Orleans and Key West after he is charged with the crimes detailed in the book, Gooding (who never changes his clothes throughout the latter half of the movie, but never looks a bit rumpled either) slowly pieces the truth together.  Unlike ""Fracture,"" a great Anthony Hopkins movie that wove a similar impossible situation tale, this movie is all set-up and no delivery, for while the actual killer's motive for one of the aforementioned murders is made clear, absolutely nothing else is.We can only guess at the killer's connection to the other victims, his connection to Gooding's character, and have no idea how or why hot-on-the-trail detective Tom Berringer arrives at just the right moment to save Gooding from becoming the killer's next victim.  Like the soon-to-be-dead teenager in the slasher movies who goes to the basement when the entire audience knows she shouldn't, Gooding meanwhile does everything possible to further incriminate himself at the pivotal end sequence.  I mean, hasn't the man ever heard of fingerprints????In the film's final minutes, Gooding is charged with we-never-learn-what, and is acquitted -in the face of an incredible amount of evidence- we never learn how.  And then the movie ends.Thematically, the movie is all over the block, first giving the audience 10,000 reasons to hate lawyers, and then having redemption and deliverance come only at the hands (and only be possible through) an attorney.  So what is the audience supposed to come away thinking?Throughout this film, its low budget is telegraphed in a thousand different ways.  Berringer's character is only believable by TV Cop standards, and the rest of the characters are unnecessary, unbelievable, or 2-dimensional.  These flaws, coupled with the gaping holes in the story, make this a failure in spite of Gooding's best efforts.  Not really worth the time it takes to watch it because it is, in the end, a muddled mess and quite dissatisfying.",2,Dead Birds,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,2950,"['unfortunate', 'fact', 'many', 'mystery', 'writers', 'novels', 'screenplays', 'are', 'often', 'far', 'better', 'concocting', 'great', 'set-up', 'perfect', 'crime', 'were', 'are', 'resolving', 'story', 'realistic', 'believable', 'way', 'movie', 'similarly', 'unfortunate', 'example.If', 'one', 'read', 'was', 'synopsis', '-a', 'man', 'given', 'manuscript', 'falsely', 'credit', 'details', 'crimes', 'subsequently', 'charged', 'destroyed', 'evidence', 'contrary-', 'good', 'classic', 'locked', 'room', 'mystery', 'problems', 'here', 'are', 'telling', 'larger', 'story', 'resolution', 'beginning', 'story', 'muddied', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'exposition', 'little', 'actually', 'trap', 'sprung', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'character', 'only', 'taken', 'series', 'characters', 'wearing', 'disguises', 'so', 'bad', ""'d"", 'not', 'pass', 'muster', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'Unbelievably', 'escaping', 'police', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Key', 'West', 'charged', 'crimes', 'detailed', 'book', 'Gooding', 'who', 'never', 'clothes', 'latter', 'half', 'movie', 'never', 'bit', 'rumpled', 'slowly', 'truth', 'together', 'Fracture', 'great', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'movie', 'wove', 'similar', 'impossible', 'situation', 'tale', 'movie', 'set-up', 'delivery', 'actual', 'killer', 'motive', 'one', 'aforementioned', 'murders', 'made', 'clear', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'else', 'is.We', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'killer', 'connection', 'other', 'victims', 'connection', 'Gooding', 'character', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'why', 'hot-on-the-trail', 'detective', 'Tom', 'Berringer', 'just', 'right', 'moment', 'save', 'Gooding', 'becoming', 'killer', 'next', 'victim', 'soon-to-be-dead', 'teenager', 'slasher', 'movies', 'who', 'basement', 'when', 'entire', 'audience', 'should', ""n't"", 'Gooding', 'meanwhile', 'everything', 'possible', 'further', 'incriminate', 'pivotal', 'end', 'sequence', 'mean', ""n't"", 'man', 'ever', 'heard', 'fingerprints', 'film', 'final', 'minutes', 'Gooding', 'charged', 'we-never-learn-what', 'acquitted', 'face', 'incredible', 'amount', 'evidence-', 'never', 'learn', 'how', 'then', 'movie', 'ends.Thematically', 'movie', 'block', 'first', 'giving', 'audience', '10,000', 'reasons', 'hate', 'lawyers', 'then', 'having', 'redemption', 'deliverance', 'come', 'only', 'hands', 'only', 'be', 'possible', 'attorney', 'what', 'audience', 'supposed', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'telegraphed', 'thousand', 'different', 'ways', 'Berringer', 'character', 'only', 'believable', 'TV', 'Cop', 'standards', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'unbelievable', '2-dimensional', 'flaws', 'coupled', 'gaping', 'holes', 'story', 'make', 'failure', 'spite', 'Gooding', 'best', 'efforts', 'Not', 'really', 'time', 'watch', 'end', 'muddled', 'mess', 'quite', 'dissatisfying']",N/A

Sardrena,"[0, 0]","Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a disbarred defense attorney whose return to prominence through a plagiarized novel is actually a frame-up in A Murder of Crows.  The film maintains a brisk pace and is mildly entertaining on a low-brow level, but the plot holes and preposterous actions of the protagonist are so ludicrous that the film becomes humorous.  Gooding is an actor who leans too heavily on his schtick of standard gestures and reactions.  In lesser efforts like these, he approaches self-parody.  When combined with his character's cluelessness to the killer's appearances as a number of different people - all in unconvincing rubber masks - the mystery reaches near-hilarity.  It doesn't help that his nemesis uses a number of obvious pseudonyms; I expected him to introduce himself as ""Mark Twain"" next.Tom Berenger gives a solidly workmanlike performance as a grizzled New Orleans detective.

The best way to enjoy this film (in my opinion) is to not think too hard, and not expect too much. Then you'll enjoy it just fine. There's plenty to enjoy.I've always liked Cuba Gooding Jr. (""Snow Dogs"") and he is very affable in this film. You can't help but root for his character, even after he does something really, really dumb. The motto ""Pride cometh before a fall"" certainly applies in this movie, and Gooding's character suffers dearly for it. He should have realized this simple wisdom--don't try to take shortcuts with certain things. They'll only come back to haunt you later. And they do for him.Even though the credits list Tom Berenger as one of the main stars, he's actually got more of a supporting role. But he does just fine in his part as a grouchy policeman who is on the tail of Gooding Jr. for a crime he didn't commit. Eric Stoltz does well as a sleazy rich guy--those clean cut good looks conceal a really creepy character.I found this to be an all-around entertaining movie, but it does have plot holes, so don't expect too much.

A Murder of Crows is an independent film with some big time star power, that makes a terrific story that much better. The film focuses on Lawson Russell, (Cuba Gooding Jr.) a successful New Orleans defense attorney, who suddenly finds his conscience. A series of events leads to his disbarment, so he begins life a new in Key West. Once there, he meets a lonely old man looking for a friend. The old man insists that Russell read his crowning achievement, a novel. Russell is more than impressed with the book and goes to tell his friend about it when he finds that the old man has died. Russell then suddenly loses his conscience again and decides to pass the book off as his own. Russell's life seems to be back on track until the FBI shows up and arrests him. As it turns out, the murders depicted in the book weren't fiction and Lawson Russell is the prime suspect. From there the film turns into a mystery, who was this old man? Why did he set Lawson up? Who is the real killer? As I said the story is ingenious and very well written, unfortunately, I watch a lot of movies and actually figured the whole thing out, twenty minutes into the film. It wasn't that the film was predictable, most of the other reviews I've read seem to suggest that most people were shocked by the ending. I have no idea why I figured out what was going on so quickly, but this film is so good, that even knowing what was going to happen, I still loved it. Cuba Gooding Jr. was just off the charts good in this movie, he brings such energy and charisma to this role, that it easy rivals his Academy Award winning performance in Jerry McGuire. The rest of the cast is terrific as well, but all the other parts were seemingly bit parts that centered around Lawson Russell. This movie was the perfect fit for Cuba Gooding Jr. and was one of the best written films I've seen all year. A Murder of Crows proves that you don't need a big budget, with huge special effects, in order to make an extremely entertaining film. Gems like this one are rare, but ultimately are the whole reason I watch Independent films.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,2207,"['Sometimes', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'coming', ""'re"", 'still', 'edge', 'seat', 'Murder', 'Crows', 'independent', 'film', 'big', 'time', 'star', 'power', 'terrific', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Lawson', 'Russell', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'successful', 'New', 'Orleans', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'suddenly', 'conscience', 'series', 'events', 'disbarment', 'life', 'new', 'Key', 'West', 'Once', 'there', 'lonely', 'old', 'man', 'looking', 'friend', 'old', 'man', 'Russell', 'read', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'novel', 'Russell', 'more', 'impressed', 'book', 'tell', 'friend', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'died', 'Russell', 'then', 'suddenly', 'conscience', 'again', 'pass', 'book', 'off', 'own', 'Russell', 'life', 'be', 'back', 'track', 'FBI', 'up', 'out', 'murders', 'depicted', 'book', 'were', ""n't"", 'fiction', 'Lawson', 'Russell', 'prime', 'suspect', 'film', 'mystery', 'who', 'was', 'old', 'man', 'Why', 'did', 'set', 'Lawson', 'up', 'Who', 'real', 'killer', 'said', 'story', 'ingenious', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'unfortunately', 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'actually', 'figured', 'whole', 'thing', 'out', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'was', 'predictable', 'most', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'seem', 'suggest', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'shocked', 'ending', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'so', 'quickly', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'even', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'still', 'loved', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'was', 'just', 'charts', 'good', 'movie', 'such', 'energy', 'charisma', 'role', 'easy', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Jerry', 'McGuire', 'rest', 'cast', 'terrific', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'parts', 'were', 'seemingly', 'bit', 'parts', 'centered', 'Lawson', 'Russell', 'movie', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Murder', 'Crows', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'big', 'budget', 'huge', 'special', 'effects', 'order', 'make', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'one', 'are', 'rare', 'ultimately', 'are', 'whole', 'reason', 'watch', 'Independent', 'films']",N/A

But to me, it was total opposite.  I don't know, maybe I'm just brain dead, but there were some major zigs and zags.The movie did drag somewhat during the investigation scenes, but overall, the pacing and directing were quite good.
