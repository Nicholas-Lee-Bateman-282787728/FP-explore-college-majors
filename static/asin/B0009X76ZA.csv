Weiss) who has successfully eluded re-capture from the dark organization known as the Centre. They had abducted Jarod as a child and made him run through simulations as a Pretender which allows him to master any profession. A charmeleon, so to speak. Jarod leads his Centre nemesis-Ms. Parker, Sydney and Mr Broots on a cross country chase, always staying one step ahead and leaving them amusing clues as to where he can be found next. In season two, the Centre operatives find they have there own demons to contend with, when the Centre's paranoia about someone within is helping Jarod alude them leads them to hire the mysterious Mr. Lyle (played to the hilt by Desperate Housewive's James Denton) and uber-bitch killer, Brigitte. The mystery deepens as questions are answered and new mysteries pop up making all envolved including the Centre's main triad have doubts about their prime players like the evil Dr. Raines and even Ms. Parker's own father....who did kill Catherine Parker? As Jarod closes in on answers about his own elusive past will others find out there are skeletons in their own closets? Ones they never knew existed?

I tried to appeal to their sense of good businessman-ship, requesting for a replacement but they never responded, even after repeated attempts.  It wasn't as though significant time had elapsed nor was I asking for my money back but simply an exchange. Their evident lack of concern in pleasing their clientele AWA standing behind their product was at the least, troubling.  Word of Caution:  Be careful when purchasing a DVD online from independent vendors if you don't intend to view it immediately... or at the least be familiar with their return policy and be sure it is reasonable.  Furthermore, it never hurts to review the negative feedback even if it takes a bit of extra time.

But the conspiracies at The Centre have become even more intricate.  The hunters find that they are now also hunted, allies are hard to come by, and evil proves itself to be extremely charming in the person of Mr. Lyle, one of the creepiest TV villains in many a long year.The Pretender's second season adds some good traits, but it also loses a little.  There is a sense that the characters have more at stake than in the past.  Jared's pursuit of his family is no longer abstract, since he knows his mother is still alive.  And Miss Parker's team has a lot more riding on their pursuit, since The Centre is in upheaval and they've been cut out of the internal politics.But the parts of this story which focus on The Centre start to get really inward-turning.  The characters occasionally lose sight of their pursuit.  The internal mechanics of The Centre become very soap-operatic, and it often seems as though the series is maintaining two parallel narratives that occasionally shake hands, instead of intertwining.  It sometimes gets tiring.On the whole, I recommend this season to all fans of the first season.  But I don't recommend getting started with this one, because it assumes you're already familiar with what's going on.  It remains fun, with the same wry humor and tension, but sometimes it risks becoming too cool for the room.",4,"Gain Some, Lose Some",1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,1420,"['fleeting', 'glimpse', 'family', 'Jared', 'even', 'deeper', 'cover', 'conspiracies', 'Centre', 'have', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'intricate', 'hunters', 'find', 'are', 'now', 'also', 'hunted', 'allies', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'evil', 'proves', 'be', 'extremely', 'charming', 'person', 'Mr.', 'Lyle', 'one', 'creepiest', 'TV', 'villains', 'many', 'long', 'year.The', 'Pretender', 'second', 'season', 'good', 'traits', 'also', 'little', 'sense', 'characters', 'have', 'more', 'stake', 'past', 'Jared', 'pursuit', 'family', 'no', 'longer', 'abstract', 'mother', 'still', 'alive', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'team', 'lot', 'more', 'riding', 'pursuit', 'Centre', 'upheaval', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cut', 'internal', 'politics.But', 'parts', 'story', 'focus', 'Centre', 'start', 'get', 'really', 'inward-turning', 'characters', 'occasionally', 'lose', 'sight', 'pursuit', 'internal', 'mechanics', 'Centre', 'become', 'very', 'soap-operatic', 'often', 'series', 'maintaining', 'two', 'parallel', 'narratives', 'occasionally', 'shake', 'hands', 'instead', 'intertwining', 'sometimes', 'whole', 'recommend', 'season', 'fans', 'first', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'started', 'one', ""'re"", 'already', 'familiar', 'what', 'going', 'fun', 'same', 'wry', 'humor', 'tension', 'becoming', 'too', 'cool', 'room']",The Pretender - The Complete Second Season

The enigmatic Mr. Raines had a greater presence here as well. They were soon followed by Harve Presnell as Mr. Parker, and Pamela Gidley as Brigitte.As the second season went on, The Centre lost faith in Miss Parker's ability to bring Jarod back. She was hounded by Lyle and Brigitte. And was never really sure where her beloved Daddy stood. To make matters worse, she began running into her own health issues. And what did happen in that Centre elevator all those years ago?The tapestry that was the central storyline for this great show, got woven a bit further.

All of the drama continues. The tale of the Pretender, 'Jarod' who is a genius who could become anyone he wanted to be but didn't know who he was, still refreshingly original. Jarod's experiences are skillfully portrayed with sensitivity by the lead actor, Michael T. Weiss. Season 2 introduces the character, 'Mr. Lyle,' played with finesse by James Denton, of current Desperate Housewives fame. Jamie Denton, as he was called then, is so convincing as the nefarious 'Mr. Lyle' that he has been avoided by people in real life because of the role! The same actually goes for Andrea Parker who plays the very complicated character 'Miss Parker,' and has had similar reactions from people in real life. (What a tribute to these performers. How can you not watch?) But unlike 'Mr. Lyle,' 'Miss Parker' is not just a one-sided person. She isn't just pure evil. 'Jarod' is very good at showing us the other facets of her character as he challenges her in ways she would never expect from anyone. Andrea Parker owns the role of 'Miss Parker' and I hope she will get to play it again at least one more time in a final ""Pretender"" movie. Meanwhile, I will enjoy these DVDs, which by the way, also contain one of Andrea's favorite episodes, ""Toy Surprise."" No spoilers here, you'll have to watch to see why!
