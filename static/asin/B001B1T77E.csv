1170018,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B001B1T77E,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[4, 4]","........""How do YOU pronounce 'Happiness'?""  (alternate title for this review).2007 may just be considered a banner year for the release of two excellent gay films:  one a romance (""Shelter""), the other (""O-H-D"") a romantic comedy; one produced on this side of the Big Pond, one on the other side of that pond.  Notably, what they have in common are decent production values, scripted stories that easily hold our interest, and male lead couples who'll keep your dreams alive and well.  As for differences, I'll only mention that where ""Shelter"" takes us on an upliftingly romantic journey, ""O-H-D"" takes us on a fun-loving, romantic journey.  And where the former film gives us that special ""B-G-L-M"", in the latter film the Brits give us the ""B-G-F-I-L-M"" (both an indoors and and outdoors one---Wow).  Please note that ""Shelter"" has already been discussed by this reviewer/commenter elsewhere on this site, so I'll now leave with you just a few additional thoughts about this, to me, memorable English production.  It so deserves NOT to be underrated/unrecognized.Starting off with our two leads, we have good looking, blond and devilish Stephen Billington, playing David, who's kinda like that let's-have-a-ball, little boy who hasn't grown up yet.  He's ""Mr. Fun"".......just over from the States, with the main goal of driving Englishman, Jonathan, both crazy and into bed.  ""J"" on the other hand is the tall, hunky, sometimes-afraid-of-letting-loose marketing exec who is our ""Mr. Serious"" (a leanly well built and gorgeous Christopher Colquhoun).  A lot of the fun you're going to have is in watching a smirky-grinning David merrily take ""J"" down (and I mean that in a ""straight"" way--Ha).  While it's the sometimes-in-a-dither ""J"" we spend a little bit more time with, it is actually David who is the solid, hold-it-all-together core of this little duo.  As in any relationship picture, there are going to be ups and downs, and these guys are terrific in giving us that back and forth, 'I-can-top-what-you're-doing' thing---while making us feel all the better for it.  And if you think they're oh-so-verrry-good in giving us a tiff to remember, it'll be the making up afterward that's the real fun (and here's where that ""B-G-F-I-L-M"" thing comes in.....it's a real hoot and will have your mind humming because you've become so pleased with what you're watching---it's just one of those memorably happy film moments).There is a very good supporting cast, everyone of whom it's not possible to mention.  BUT........there is a little girl (Poppy) who comes up with a couple of ""philosophical zingers"" which are a riot and which let us know she's more grown up than any of the rest of them.  Oh, oh, and then there's my favorite of the adult, supporting actresses......you know, the gal with the rose on her ass (no, make that 'arse').  (Lol).Winding down here, my ""Best of the Night"" award has to go to Director/Writer Ian Poitier who, however he did it, has gotten Billington and Colquhoun to give us some of the best man-on-man ""lip-lock"" scenes you're going to see outside of gay porn.  Way to go, Guys; that's usually the big downfall of other gay mainline films.Lastly, ""Happy M'Buki--M'Vuki"" to each and everyone of you out there!PS--Ah.....the ""B-G-F-I-L-M"" thing?  Okay....well that simply stands for ""Big Gay Falling In Love Montage"" (thanks, Director Jonah Markowitz).PPS--Oh.....yeah, and that ""Happiness"" bit?  Dudes---if you can't speak French, you're never gonna get this one (Lol).****",4,"""Whole Lotta Snoggin' Goin' On""...............or........",1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,3506,"['..', 'How', 'do', 'pronounce', 'alternate', 'title', 'review', '.2007', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'considered', 'banner', 'year', 'release', 'two', 'excellent', 'gay', 'films', 'one', 'romance', 'Shelter', 'other', 'O-H-D', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'one', 'produced', 'side', 'Big', 'Pond', 'one', 'other', 'side', 'pond', 'Notably', 'what', 'have', 'common', 'are', 'decent', 'production', 'values', 'scripted', 'stories', 'easily', 'hold', 'interest', 'male', 'lead', 'couples', 'who', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'dreams', 'alive', 'well', 'differences', ""'ll"", 'only', 'mention', 'where', 'Shelter', 'upliftingly', 'romantic', 'journey', 'O-H-D', 'fun-loving', 'romantic', 'journey', 'where', 'former', 'film', 'special', 'B-G-L-M', 'latter', 'film', 'Brits', 'give', 'B-G-F-I-L-M', 'indoors', 'outdoors', 'one', '-Wow', 'Please', 'note', 'Shelter', 'already', 'been', 'discussed', 'reviewer/commenter', 'elsewhere', 'site', ""'ll"", 'now', 'leave', 'just', 'few', 'additional', 'thoughts', 'memorable', 'English', 'production', 'so', 'NOT', 'be', 'underrated/unrecognized.Starting', 'off', 'two', 'leads', 'have', 'good', 'looking', 'blond', 'devilish', 'Stephen', 'Billington', 'playing', 'David', 'who', 'kinda', ""let's-have-a-ball"", 'little', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'grown', 'up', 'yet', 'Mr.', 'Fun', '.just', 'States', 'main', 'goal', 'driving', 'Englishman', 'Jonathan', 'crazy', 'bed', 'J', 'other', 'hand', 'tall', 'hunky', 'sometimes-afraid-of-letting-loose', 'marketing', 'exec', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Serious', 'leanly', 'well', 'built', 'gorgeous', 'Christopher', 'Colquhoun', 'lot', 'fun', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'watching', 'smirky-grinning', 'David', 'merrily', 'take', 'J', 'down', 'mean', 'straight', 'way', 'Ha', 'sometimes-in-a-dither', 'J', 'spend', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'actually', 'David', 'who', 'solid', 'hold-it-all-together', 'core', 'little', 'duo', 'relationship', 'picture', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'ups', 'downs', 'guys', 'are', 'terrific', 'giving', 'back', 'forth', ""I-can-top-what-you're-doing"", 'thing', '-while', 'making', 'feel', 'better', 'think', ""'re"", 'oh-so-verrry-good', 'giving', 'tiff', 'remember', ""'ll"", 'be', 'making', 'up', 'afterward', 'real', 'fun', 'here', 'where', 'B-G-F-I-L-M', 'thing', '..it', 'real', 'hoot', 'will', 'have', 'mind', 'humming', ""'ve"", 'become', 'so', 'pleased', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', '-it', 'just', 'one', 'memorably', 'happy', 'film', 'moments', 'very', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'everyone', 'whom', 'not', 'possible', 'mention', 'BUT', 'little', 'girl', 'Poppy', 'who', 'up', 'couple', 'philosophical', 'zingers', 'are', 'riot', 'let', 'know', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'rest', 'Oh', 'oh', 'then', 'favorite', 'adult', 'supporting', 'actresses', 'know', 'gal', 'rose', 'ass', 'make', ""'arse"", 'Lol', '.Winding', 'down', 'here', 'Best', 'Night', 'award', 'go', 'Director/Writer', 'Ian', 'Poitier', 'who', 'however', 'did', 'gotten', 'Billington', 'Colquhoun', 'give', 'best', 'man-on-man', 'lip-lock', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'gay', 'porn', 'Way', 'go', 'Guys', 'usually', 'big', 'downfall', 'other', 'gay', 'mainline', 'films.Lastly', 'Happy', ""M'Buki"", ""M'Vuki"", 'everyone', 'there', 'PS', 'Ah', 'B-G-F-I-L-M', 'thing', 'Okay', '.well', 'simply', 'Big', 'Gay', 'Falling', 'Love', 'Montage', 'thanks', 'Director', 'Jonah', 'Markowitz', '.PPS', 'Oh', '..yeah', 'Happiness', 'bit', 'Dudes', '-if', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'French', ""'re"", 'never', 'gon', 'get', 'one', 'Lol', '****']",Oh Happy Day

1170027,A342EHO42V2G38,B001B1T77E,"Terran ""Terran""","[8, 9]","Except the kitchen sink is in here too!Like the other reviewers thus far, I love this film.  This is the best gay couple protrayed in film, in that the guys are perfectly suited for each other, they complement each other and bring out the best in each other.  They are passionate, and the actors physically relaxed with each other and REAL.  They look great together, as if in a roomful of gays these are the two you'd pair up as the best match.  I can't think of another movie where I've seen the gay couple and went THEY CLICK!  Other pairings are found wanting.The direction has some interesting montage sequences and usage of still photography that keep the film fresh and less likely to be a point-and-shoot. Here the edits are spot-on in accentuating the story or a specific mood, best example of this is when Jonathan - whose story it is we're following - is at a social gathering, feeling stormy inside as he is desperately on the lookout for his love - David - who has dumped him.  Yes, we have delicious angst in this romantic comedy!This movie would almost be the kitchen-sink approach, as everything is tossed in here, Jonathan being a father who is best friends with the mother of his child and yet he is undeniably gay (they don't really go into that background story).  Yet we also have David who is displaced as he has just moved to London and left his (unforgiving of his gay self) family behind (the actor who plays this part, Stephen Billington, is English but does a great gen-American accent).  Jonathan's own mother is presumably an immigrant with an accent to go with it, and therefore London being the land of immigrants is also touched upon - meanwhile Mom and her best friend specialize in being experts on gays and metrosexuals - and David ironically is far more well-traveled than anyone, so he's less marginalized.  We are invested in Jonathan's family and David is introduced into the mix without fanfare but great success, so the drama for the couple is kept strictly on the work front.  To add to the everything tossed in we also have a love montage sequence where amateur musician Jonathan has presumably composed a song about his love.  Unfortunately the song ""Easier To Sleep"" - composed by the actor playing the part - isn't available anywhere except this film, as it is lovely and poignant.Even the precocious daughter of Jonathan is smitten with David to the extent he may be Daddy's boyfriend, but Daddy has taken a clear backseat in her affections and you can bet she has little-girl fantasies of marrying David herself some day.Both leads are hot, and interesting, and so straight-acting neither David nor Jonathan immediately twig to the fact the other is ""family.""  When they do, they act upon their mutual desire immediately. Complicating the situation slightly is a female co-worker of Jonathan's who has the hots for David and doesn't know he's gay (he seems to be closeted only to protect his relationship with Jonathan from being discovered, so Jonathan doesn't get fired for the fraternization.)Another complication is Jonathan once spent a weekend with another gay staffer at the same agency and this only becomes important as it has later repercussions on his relationship with David.Both guys are great in this, and this would be rated 5 stars rather than 4 by me except that we really don't see enough of the guys together functioning as a couple.  There are three montage sequences, but most of the time when we see the couple, it is when they are in the business environment or around Jonathan's family.  The glances and casual touches the guys display with each other indicate their closeness and you can applaud the actors for this.  As well, I really wanted to see more of David's POV in this, some equal time, as it were, especially when the couple was broken up.  It seems as if the ad agency and the people there as well as trying to give equal time to Jonathan's family relationships were really using up all the air time.The DVD contains no extras, which is lamentable, especially since another reviewer has mentioned a scene that is not in the film as released on the Region 1 DVD, making me wonder about this special cut we have where possibly one or more scenes is missing.  I felt a few times as well, that the pacing was off, possibly because David and Jonathan (get the Biblical reference?) time was edited out.  Watch out for the times the ""Is this weird?"" question is asked by each man, and also how their first and final kisses are paralleled.  A lot of time was spent on choreographing the mens' moments together.
