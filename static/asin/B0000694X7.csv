I don't claim to know what the director had in mind, but I know what I take from this movie. I am NOT a golfer, but this film leaves me with an appreciation for golf which I have never before felt. Bagger Vance was okay, but more an entertaining film than a study of golf. Nor is A Gentleman's Game all about golf. There's a lot going on here, some of it is about golfing, some of it deals with the inside, or other side of the game, the &quot;loopers.&quot; Ultimately this movie is not about golfing, even though it chiefly centers on golfing and around a golf course. The overall story comes together with meaning greater than its several individual parts. Gary Sinise never dissapoints &amp; the entire cast delivers wonderfully in this film, but Mason Gamble is the one to watch. A very talented young actor. I am reminded of Kevin Spacey in Shipping News, wherein Spacey virtually tells the entire movie with his facial expressions. Gamble does not quite have as demanding a role here as Spacey had in Shipping News, but he does remarkably well with what he's given---&amp; considering his age that's all the more impressive. We easily know what his character, Timmy, is feeling at all times without having to hear any dialog. Mason Gamble has been around a while, &amp; I'm sure will have no trouble remaining in the industry as long as he chooses to keep making movies. Look for him in the quirky Rushmore, or in the hook-setting opening scene of Arlington Road, &amp; periodically thereafter throughout. I believe he was also Dennis the Mennace, &amp; I'm sure he's done a few other films.  I like gentleman's Game because it tells a story that centers around something I previously cared nothing about; now I at least have some appreciation for, and a much greater understanding of, golf. It's a good movie, and it's deffinately telling a worth while story. Plus it had the added bonus for me of coming as an unexpected surprise treat when I first saw it. (I had a cheap rental coupon &amp; never hearing of it before, happened upon it while browsing in Hollywood Video) I reccomend this movie as a great one to watch and a good one to own.",5,This is a very good movie,1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,2250,"['think', 'perhaps', 'people', 'who', 'reviewed', 'film', 'negatively', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'know', 'what', 'director', 'had', 'mind', 'know', 'what', 'take', 'movie', 'am', 'NOT', 'golfer', 'film', 'appreciation', 'golf', 'have', 'never', 'before', 'felt', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'was', 'okay', 'more', 'entertaining', 'film', 'study', 'golf', 'Gentleman', 'Game', 'golf', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'golfing', 'inside', 'other', 'side', 'game', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'not', 'golfing', 'even', 'centers', 'golfing', 'golf', 'course', 'overall', 'story', 'together', 'meaning', 'greater', 'several', 'individual', 'parts', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'never', 'amp', 'entire', 'cast', 'delivers', 'wonderfully', 'film', 'Mason', 'Gamble', 'one', 'watch', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'actor', 'am', 'reminded', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Shipping', 'News', 'wherein', 'Spacey', 'virtually', 'entire', 'movie', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Gamble', 'not', 'quite', 'have', 'demanding', 'role', 'here', 'Spacey', 'had', 'Shipping', 'News', 'remarkably', 'well', 'what', 'given', 'amp', 'considering', 'age', 'more', 'impressive', 'easily', 'know', 'what', 'character', 'Timmy', 'feeling', 'times', 'having', 'hear', 'dialog', 'Mason', 'Gamble', 'been', 'while', 'amp', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'remaining', 'industry', 'as', 'long', 'keep', 'making', 'movies', 'Look', 'quirky', 'Rushmore', 'hook-setting', 'opening', 'scene', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'amp', 'periodically', 'thereafter', 'believe', 'was', 'also', 'Dennis', 'Mennace', 'amp', ""'m"", 'sure', 'done', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'like', 'gentleman', 'Game', 'story', 'centers', 'something', 'previously', 'cared', 'nothing', 'now', 'least', 'have', 'appreciation', 'much', 'greater', 'understanding', 'golf', 'good', 'movie', 'deffinately', 'telling', 'worth', 'story', 'had', 'added', 'bonus', 'coming', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'treat', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'had', 'cheap', 'rental', 'coupon', 'amp', 'never', 'hearing', 'happened', 'browsing', 'Hollywood', 'Video', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'great', 'one', 'watch', 'good', 'one', 'own']",A Gentleman's Game

706653,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B0000694X7,"""flickjunkie""","[5, 7]","This is not really a film about golf, but a film about life with golf as the backdrop.  Therein lies the problem.  First time director J. Mills Goodloe can't seem to choose where he wants to go with the story and it meanders aimlessly from storyline to storyline in an attempt to give it a coming-of-age flavor.He would have been better to concentrate on Timmy (Mason Gamble) and his relationship with Foster (Gary Sinise) in his quest to improve his golf game.  This is clearly the best and most interesting element of the story.  Instead he flits about following Timmy's relationship with the other loopers, his infatuation with the beverage girl and the happenings at various club events.  The relationship between Timmy and Foster never really gets much traction until the final scene and even then the validation is delivered via a letter rather than a face to face encounter, which would have made it poignant and satisfying.The acting by Mason Gamble and Gary Sinise is excellent.  They have good chemistry and it is clear they connect.  Gamble gives a very steady performance throughout and gives the character a naive charm and steely resolve that are extremely engaging.  Sinise plays a stolid and standoffish character harboring a terrible secret and bitter disappointment.  His understated performance is a perfect fit for this complex character whose cavalier nature hides deeper turmoil.  The rest of the cast is simply terrible.  Dylan Baker is horrible as Timmy's dad.  Phillip Baker Hall is awful as the two faced Charlie Logan.This film had great potential that was never realized.  I rated it 5/10.

I spent an agonizing hour and fifty eight minutes wondering where the film was going, what it had to do with golf, and how many sappy clich&eacute;-ridden storylines could you throw together.  Spoiler alert...just because Gary Sinese is in a film, does not meaning the film is a gem.Spoiler alerts abound to follow...see if you can follow.""A Gentleman's Game"" is a convoluted story of a young man who grows up to enjoy the game of golf...for the purity of it all.  He learns his natural swing by whacking balls into the ocean while former golfer, turned Yoda, Gary Sinese sits by and tells the kid that he won't help him.Cut away from that storyline, which may be the real storyline, and you have the father who teachers his son the morals of golf, yet walks away from his son on the driving range when he can't show him what he learned at a lesson.  His father later goes against his son, for reasons unknown, in a tournament where a father commits a penalty by pointing out the line for his son by grounding the flag on the putting service.  This is a penalty in golf.  But the ignorant father bullies little Timmy and accuses Timmy of calling him a liar.  Timmy's father shrinks and basically tells Timmy to back off.  Silly.Next, there is the little love/romance deal where Timmy is enamored with a 15 year old gal from the club.  He likes her a lot and tells her so by telling her she ""smells good"".  The girl goes skinny dipping without him and comes to respect Timmy because he doesn't jump in with her.  Quite a romantic story  She put her hand on his shoulder.Next there is Phillip Baker Hall, who plays a sage old member of the golf club.  He is enamored with Timmy's beautiful, pure golf swing.  But later he plays in a member guest tournament...supposedly vying for the title, despite a putrid swing... where he completely ignores Timmy and then goes onto a drinking binge which ultimately culminates in him ripping into his black caddy with a series of racial slurs.  Timmy's dad steps forward and tells him to shut up...AFTER the caddy walks off the course in shame.  Is this the ""gentleman's game""?Oh yeah... a caddy whose thumbs were blown off when his parents gave him a firecracker doesn't show up for work for a while and we come to find out that the head of the country club had him out back in the swimming pool and took pictures of him and touched him and he was upset and his dad was upset.  Dramatic gunshots ring out....AND....the father of the boy with no thumbs shot into the Rolls Royce of the pedophile.  Timmy states that the caddy won't be coming back and he's not his friend.  Cut to: club where the voiceover tells us no charges were filed and no one arrested.I am an avid golfer.  This film has zero to do about golf.  Perhaps on really superficial, kindergarten levels, the story has something to do with the lessons of golf.  But to get to those lessons, you must first come up with the lesson to be learned and then try to work backwards and imply how the film speaks to these issues...varied and wide-ranging and lacking any kind of continuity.Putrid.",1,Not a movie for golfers.
