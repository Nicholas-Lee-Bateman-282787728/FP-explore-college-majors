Following on the heels of a series of successful sitcoms starring stand-up comics - Seinfeld, Home Improvement, The Drew Carey Show, etc., Everybody Loves Raymond drew upon the comedic talents of Ray Romano who plays the role of the title character Ray Barone...A successful Long Island-based sportswriter, Ray and his wife Debra (Patricia Heaton) enjoy a happy marriage and the company of their three children - daughter Ally (Madylin Sweeten) and twin sons Geoffrey (Sawyer Sweeten) and Michael (Sullivan Sweeten). But they also happen to live directly across the street from Ray's parents, Frank (Peter Boyle) and Marie (Doris Roberts), who take it upon themselves to enter their son and daughter-in-law's house whenever they wish (without knocking) and dispense advice and sometimes insults. Joining Frank and Marie is Ray's brother Robert (Brad Garrett), a divorced policeman, who periodically lives with Frank and Marie and is often jealous of Ray's idyllic life. Together, they create the perfect loving and dysfunctional family...The Everybody Loves Raymond (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which Ray and Debra's house gets quarantined after they spray for termites. Moving into Frank and Marie's house along with the kids, they decide to give Ray's parents a dose of their own medicine, but quickly learn that it's near impossible to turn the tables on their annoying relatives... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Getting Even"" in which Debra vows revenge on Ray for embarrassing her, prompting Ray to drive himself crazy in anticipation of her retaliation, and ""Moving Out"" in which Robert attempts to move out of his parents house and into a garage apartment only to realize that the couple he's now living with are clones of the very parents he sought to escape...Below is a list of episodes included on the Everybody Loves Raymond (Season 3) DVD:Episode 48 (The Invasion)Episode 49 (Driving Frank)Episode 50 (The Sitter)Episode 51 (Getting Even)Episode 52 (The Visit)Episode 53 (Halloween Candy)Episode 54 (Moving Out)Episode 55 (The Article)Episode 56 (The Lone Barone)Episode 57 (No Fat)Episode 58 (The Apartment)Episode 59 (The Toaster)Episode 60 (Ping Pong)Episode 61 (Pants on Fire)Episode 62 (Robert's Date)Episode 63 (Frank's Tribute)Episode 64 (Cruising with Marie)Episode 65 (Ray Home Alone)Episode 66 (Big Shots)Episode 67 (Move Over)Episode 68 (The Getaway)Episode 69 (Working Girl)Episode 70 (Be Nice)Episode 71 (Dancing with Debra)Episode 72 (Robert Moves Back)Episode 73 (How They Met)The DVD Report",5,One of the best shows of its time...,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,2759,"['First', 'telecast', 'Fall', '1996', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'became', 'instant', 'favorite', 'TV', 'audiences', 'love', 'affair', 'would', 'last', 'nine', 'memorable', 'seasons', 'Following', 'heels', 'series', 'successful', 'sitcoms', 'starring', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'Seinfeld', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'Show', 'etc.', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'drew', 'comedic', 'talents', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'who', 'role', 'title', 'character', 'Ray', 'Barone', 'successful', 'Long', 'Island-based', 'sportswriter', 'Ray', 'wife', 'Debra', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'enjoy', 'happy', 'marriage', 'company', 'three', 'children', 'daughter', 'Ally', 'Madylin', 'Sweeten', 'twin', 'sons', 'Geoffrey', 'Sawyer', 'Sweeten', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Sweeten', 'also', 'happen', 'live', 'directly', 'street', 'Ray', 'parents', 'Frank', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'Marie', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'who', 'take', 'enter', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'house', 'whenever', 'wish', 'knocking', 'dispense', 'advice', 'sometimes', 'insults', 'Joining', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'Ray', 'brother', 'Robert', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'divorced', 'policeman', 'who', 'periodically', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'often', 'jealous', 'Ray', 'idyllic', 'life', 'Together', 'create', 'perfect', 'loving', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Ray', 'Debra', 'house', 'quarantined', 'spray', 'termites', 'Moving', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'house', 'kids', 'decide', 'give', 'Ray', 'parents', 'dose', 'own', 'medicine', 'quickly', 'learn', 'near', 'impossible', 'turn', 'tables', 'annoying', 'relatives', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Getting', 'Even', 'Debra', 'revenge', 'Ray', 'embarrassing', 'prompting', 'Ray', 'drive', 'crazy', 'anticipation', 'retaliation', 'Moving', 'Out', 'Robert', 'move', 'parents', 'house', 'garage', 'apartment', 'only', 'realize', 'couple', 'now', 'living', 'are', 'clones', 'very', 'sought', 'escape', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '48', 'Invasion', 'Episode', '49', 'Driving', 'Frank', 'Episode', '50', 'Sitter', 'Episode', '51', 'Getting', 'Even', 'Episode', '52', 'Visit', 'Episode', '53', 'Halloween', 'Candy', 'Episode', '54', 'Moving', 'Out', 'Episode', '55', 'Article', 'Episode', '56', 'Lone', 'Barone', 'Episode', '57', 'No', 'Fat', 'Episode', '58', 'Apartment', 'Episode', '59', 'Toaster', 'Episode', '60', 'Ping', 'Pong', 'Episode', '61', 'Pants', 'Fire', 'Episode', '62', 'Robert', 'Date', 'Episode', '63', 'Frank', 'Tribute', 'Episode', '64', 'Cruising', 'Marie', 'Episode', '65', 'Ray', 'Home', 'Alone', 'Episode', '66', 'Big', 'Shots', 'Episode', '67', 'Move', 'Over', 'Episode', '68', 'Getaway', 'Episode', '69', 'Working', 'Girl', 'Episode', '70', 'Be', 'Nice', 'Episode', '71', 'Dancing', 'Debra', 'Episode', '72', 'Robert', 'Moves', 'Back', 'Episode', '73', 'How', 'Met', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

To compound the problem, Ray's older brother Robert, a divorced NYPD lieutenant, moves back home...This show doesn't look for sophisticated, implausible storylines. Rather, it focuses upon the tiny aspects of everyday life and relationships - father/son, husband/wife, brother/brother, parent/child - and finds comedy in the truth. Ray and Debra often clash, as he just wants to relax when he comes home from work, and she - a stay-at-home mom - wants him to pitch in, or go out. Frank is crass, and Marie is nosy and opinionated.Season 3 includes Robert moving out; a ""tofu turkey"" for Thanksgiving; and the infamous episode where Frank accidentally hands out something wildly inappropriate into the neighborhood children's Halloween bags.If you're unfamiliar with this show, check it out!

Season 3 is a return to the consistently funny and entertaining stride the show hit as Season One found its momentum.The gag reel is not to be missed, though a bit shorter than I'd hoped.  The Academy of Television panel discussion is an unexpectedly delightful bonus feature, although sometimes seeing these ensemble actors outside of the milieu of their show is akin to pulling back the curtain to look at the Wizard -- you almost hate to see them NOT in the show.The rock band KISS lost quite a bit of their mystique and appeal when they took off the make-up after 10 years.  And going behind the scenes with the ELR cast, be it with the Academy of Television panel or the gag reel, does in a tiny way destroy the ""magic"" of it all.I have attended 5 sitcom tapings over the years, and without fail I can never watch those shows the same way again.  The ""fourth wall"" was forever broken, and instead of seeing the characters in the show's element I would instead always envision the cast and large crew at work on the soundstage of their particular studio, surrounded by swing sets (the ""theatrical"" kind, not the playground kind), the studio audience, the geography of the building, studio, outside neighborhood of L.A. or Burbank, etc.What's my point?  The Season 3 ELR extras are fun, but sometimes too much ""insider"" view can spoil the magic.So bear that in mind as you watch these bonus features.

My favorites from this season are ""Moving Out,"" ""Robert's Date,"" ""Move Over,"" and ""The Toaster.""Disc 1:""The Invasion""--While Deb and Ray's house is being fumigated for termites, they stay with Ray's parents and are accused of being intrusive.""Driving Frank""--Debra is no longer comfortable with Frank driving the kids.""The Sitter""--Debra is jealous that the kids like the new babysitter better than her.  When another couple hires the sitter, Ray takes desperate measures to get her back (classic scene!).""Getting Even""--Raymond the auctioneer tells jokes at Debra's expense so she threatens to get him back which makes him paranoid over everything.""The Visit""--Debra's mother visits and she doesn't take much interest in the family.""Halloween Candy""--When a lack of bc ruins a night of passion, Ray takes over the bc department and Frank gives something other than candy to trick-or-treaters.Disc 2:""Moving Out""--Ray convinces Robert to move out of his parents' house but he finds a place that is not quite the radical change he had in mind.  Very funny.""The Article""--Ray critiques his friend Andy's article and finds out it's going to be published in Sport Illustrated even without Ray's changes.""The Lone Barone""--Robert finally moves into his own place and is feeling controlled by his girlfriend Amy which is furthered emphasized by Raymond's comparison of married life to a hostage situation.""No Fat""--Marie decides to cook healthy but her family isn't too keen on her tofu turkey for Thanksgiving.""The Apartment""--Raymond visits Robert's new place and, after seeing all the beautiful young women living there, decides to visit more often.""The Toaster""--Raymond buys his parents an engraved toaster for Christmas and they exchange it.  It's funny how Raymond obsesses over so many things.Disc 3:""Ping-Pong""--Raymond thinks he's the only one to have beaten his father at ping pong until he finds out his dad let him win because he cried.  ""Zero serving zero, Ray can kiss my rearo.""""Pants on Fire""--Marie finds out Raymond had a party at her house when he was in high school so now Robert is the favorite son (you know that won't last).""Robert's Date""--Robert hangs out with his patrol partner Judy's peeps and he starts acting ethnic which his family thinks is wack, you dig?""Frank's Tribute""--Frank is voted `Man of the Year' in his lodge and Raymond and Robert film a tribute for the ceremony but none of his lodge buddies have anything nice to say about him.""Cruising With Marie""--Frank injures his knee so Ray fills in as Marie's cruise escort and sees a different side of his mother through the eyes of the other cruisers.""Ray Home Alone""--Ray has a problem sleeping in his house by himself.  A little unrealistic, but whatever.Disc 4:""Big Shots""--Raymond takes Robert to an event honoring the 1969 Mets and they try to use their occupations to show off their influence.  I like the ending when the old ballplayers try to do the same thing.""Move Over""--Raymond can't sleep because Debra keeps rolling on him.""The Getaway""--Ray and Deb go on a vacation to Vermont and can't seem to have much fun together.""Working Girl""--Feeling unfulfilled with her housewife life, Debra gets a job at an advertising agency and is fired on her first day.""Be Nice""--Debra notices that she and Ray are nicer to other people than they are to each other and proposes they try to treat each other better.""Dancing With Debra""--Robert is in need of a dance partner so Ray volunteers Debra and gets jealous at the fun they have.Disc 5:""Robert Moves Back""--Robert and Amy finally do it in front of Robert's uncurtained windows at his apartment which makes it difficult to live there.""How They Met""--As usual, the season ends with a flashback.  This one is Debra and Raymond's first meeting when Ray is the assistant futon guy.  Another hair style for Robert.  We learn that Debra did PR for the NY Rangers.  I wonder why she doesn't show any interest in sports in the other episodes?",4,"""I've been wanting to take a nap since Ally was born""--Debra",1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,4129,"['4', '1/2', 'Stars', 'ELR', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'series', 'one', 'not', 'as', 'consistent', 'other', 'seasons', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'favorites', 'season', 'are', 'Moving', 'Out', 'Robert', 'Date', 'Move', 'Over', 'Toaster', 'Disc', '1', 'Invasion', 'Deb', 'Ray', 'house', 'being', 'fumigated', 'termites', 'stay', 'Ray', 'parents', 'are', 'accused', 'being', 'intrusive', 'Driving', 'Frank', 'Debra', 'no', 'longer', 'comfortable', 'Frank', 'driving', 'kids', 'Sitter', 'Debra', 'jealous', 'kids', 'new', 'babysitter', 'better', 'When', 'couple', 'sitter', 'Ray', 'desperate', 'measures', 'get', 'back', 'classic', 'scene', 'Getting', 'Even', 'Raymond', 'auctioneer', 'jokes', 'Debra', 'expense', 'get', 'back', 'paranoid', 'everything', 'Visit', 'Debra', 'mother', 'visits', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'interest', 'family', 'Halloween', 'Candy', 'When', 'lack', 'bc', 'night', 'passion', 'Ray', 'bc', 'department', 'Frank', 'something', 'other', 'candy', 'trick-or-treaters.Disc', '2', 'Moving', 'Out', 'Ray', 'convinces', 'Robert', 'move', 'parents', 'house', 'place', 'not', 'quite', 'radical', 'change', 'had', 'mind', 'Very', 'funny', 'Article', 'Ray', 'friend', 'Andy', 'article', 'out', 'going', 'be', 'published', 'Sport', 'Illustrated', 'even', 'Ray', 'changes', 'Lone', 'Barone', 'Robert', 'finally', 'own', 'place', 'feeling', 'controlled', 'girlfriend', 'Amy', 'furthered', 'emphasized', 'Raymond', 'comparison', 'married', 'life', 'hostage', 'situation', 'Fat', 'Marie', 'cook', 'healthy', 'family', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'tofu', 'turkey', 'Thanksgiving', 'Apartment', 'Raymond', 'Robert', 'new', 'place', 'seeing', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'living', 'there', 'decides', 'visit', 'more', 'often', 'Toaster', 'Raymond', 'parents', 'engraved', 'toaster', 'Christmas', 'exchange', 'funny', 'how', 'Raymond', 'so', 'many', 'things.Disc', '3', 'Ping-Pong', 'Raymond', 'only', 'one', 'have', 'beaten', 'father', 'ping', 'pong', 'out', 'dad', 'let', 'win', 'cried', 'Zero', 'serving', 'zero', 'Ray', 'can', 'kiss', 'rearo', 'Pants', 'Fire', 'Marie', 'out', 'Raymond', 'had', 'party', 'house', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'so', 'now', 'Robert', 'favorite', 'son', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'last', 'Robert', 'Date', 'Robert', 'out', 'patrol', 'partner', 'Judy', 'peeps', 'acting', 'ethnic', 'family', 'wack', 'dig', 'Frank', 'Tribute', 'Frank', 'voted', 'Man', 'Year', 'lodge', 'Raymond', 'Robert', 'film', 'tribute', 'ceremony', 'none', 'lodge', 'buddies', 'have', 'anything', 'nice', 'say', 'Cruising', 'Marie', 'Frank', 'knee', 'so', 'Ray', 'fills', 'Marie', 'cruise', 'escort', 'different', 'side', 'mother', 'eyes', 'other', 'cruisers', 'Ray', 'Home', 'Alone', 'Ray', 'problem', 'sleeping', 'house', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'whatever.Disc', '4', 'Big', 'Shots', 'Raymond', 'Robert', 'event', 'honoring', '1969', 'Mets', 'try', 'use', 'occupations', 'show', 'off', 'influence', 'ending', 'when', 'old', 'ballplayers', 'try', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'Move', 'Over', 'Raymond', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'Debra', 'rolling', 'Getaway', 'Ray', 'Deb', 'go', 'vacation', 'Vermont', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'fun', 'together', 'Working', 'Girl', 'Feeling', 'unfulfilled', 'housewife', 'life', 'Debra', 'job', 'advertising', 'agency', 'fired', 'first', 'day', 'Be', 'Nice', 'Debra', 'notices', 'Ray', 'are', 'nicer', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'other', 'try', 'treat', 'other', 'better', 'Dancing', 'Debra', 'Robert', 'need', 'dance', 'partner', 'Ray', 'volunteers', 'Debra', 'jealous', 'fun', 'have.Disc', '5', 'Robert', 'Moves', 'Back', 'Robert', 'Amy', 'finally', 'do', 'front', 'Robert', 'uncurtained', 'windows', 'apartment', 'difficult', 'live', 'there', 'How', 'Met', 'usual', 'season', 'flashback', 'one', 'Debra', 'Raymond', 'first', 'meeting', 'when', 'Ray', 'assistant', 'futon', 'guy', 'hair', 'style', 'Robert', 'learn', 'Debra', 'did', 'PR', 'NY', 'Rangers', 'wonder', 'why', ""n't"", 'show', 'interest', 'sports', 'other', 'episodes']",N/A

This show is one of the best on television today.  I'm sorry to see it ending.  The show revolves around Ray and Debra, who must deal with his nutty family across the street.  The dialogue is always sharp and funny.  Peter Boyle's ""Frank"" is the best on the show.  But Dorris Roberts', Brad Grarett's, Patrica Heaton's characters always add life to the series.  And of course Ray Ramono himself is great for laughs, always confused by the overreactions of his wife and parents at the things he says.  He is also often caught in the middle of an disagreement between his wife and mother, and both of them expect him to side with one or the other.  This is a simply a cult classic.

Didn't take me long to see why this show was so highly talked about. My favorite episode from Season 3, without a doubt was #10 (No Fat). Because of the results from a health fair, Marie decided to put both her and Frank on a diet. Since Thanksgiving was nearby, Marie decided to change things up and cook an all healthy thanksgiving meal, instead of the good, high calorie stuff. This turned out to be a near disaster. So, Marie brings out the bird, and after Frank observed it, he said, ""May I have my carving knife, please? I wanna sl** my throat!!!"". I nearly fell over laughing, just listening to that line. That just goes to show that Peter Boyle was a genius, playing the character of Frank. After he was asked to try the ""fake"" turkey, his facial expressions drove me insane with laughter. Honestly, it was such a hysterical moment, watching thanksgiving day unravel at the Barones.Another favorite from this season, was episode 15, where Robert decided to hang out with his cop partner, Judy, who just happened to be black, which wasn't a problem for Robert, but it seemed like a big deal to Frank and Marie, and of course, the insults started flying out. Robert tried to transform himself into being like one of Judy's friends, which blew up in his face.This was television at it's best, and I for one enjoyed it. Go out and get this for yourself.

Much like Seinfeld it's a show that is going out while still being at the top of its game and I really can't believe the show has been on for nine years.  But the show will be one that will survive for years in re-runs.  It's that smart and that funny.  That makes a good sitcom is great characters and Raymond had them hand over fist.  I think it will be a long time before I ever get tired of watching this show.  Here are some of my favorite episodes from the third season:""The Invasion""  The opening episode has Ray and family forced to move in with his parents when their home is being cleaned for termites.  Ray and Debra decide to give Marie and Frank a taste of their own, butt-insky treatment.""The Sitter""  Marie is insulted when Debra hires a young baby-sitter instead of asking her.  They let the sitter go but then Marie finds out she can't keep up with the kids.""Halloween Candy"" one of my all-time favorites.  Ray plans to get a vasectomy but backs out.  He decides then to use condoms and buys a multi-colored pack that Frank mistakes for candy and gives out to the kids for Halloween.""No Fat""  Marie wants to eat healthier and puts Frank and herself on a diet right before Thanksgiving and even makes a tofu turkey, much to the family's horror.  Ray orders a real turkey and catches Marie sneaking some of it later.""The Toaster""  A Christmas Episode.  Ray gives family and friends a personalized toaster as a gift.  he then finds out his parents returned the gift without ever opening it.""Roberts Date"" Robert hits it off with his new female partner who happens to be African-American.

I didn't begin watching this series until it made it to daily syndicated repeats, and once I started watching it I saw a lot of truth in the show...a lot of real life family situations, and while Ray Romano's delivery may not be everyone's style...Ray Barone is just a guy trying to deal with what his life has given him, in this case a brother who thinks he's playing second fiddle, a wife who's smarter than anyone gives her credit for and parents who are absolutely priceless. They simply couldn't have picked a finer group of people to play these characters. Sure, some folks say ""What was the big deal about Seinfeld or Friends?"" and the big deal was the way they all worked together and the way we all got to know their characters and their histories together, what worked out, what didn't. There's a chemistry unique to Everybody Loves Raymond that a lot of the critics completely miss when they say they think the show is boring...it's the ensemble working together that makes this show...made Friends what it was, Seinfeld, WKRP in Cincinnati...they made each other look great and you can tell they were having a great time doing it. The commentary in episode one on the first season collection explains it all: the title is said from the perspective of Robert, Ray's brother...that's how he feels: ""Yeah, I bust my butt every day and I try to be the best I can...but EVERYBODY loves Raymond...""
