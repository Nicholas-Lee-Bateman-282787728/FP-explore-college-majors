1161750,A11EKP8L073NEY,B00197X1U4,"A. M. Lewis ""Blueberry Ale""","[26, 27]","Three and a half starsI have to admit that this documentary is something of a disappointment.  Let me backtrack a second.  There seems to be three types of music fans over the last three years.  Those who love and worship Angels and Airwaves, those who absolutely hate Angels and Airwaves, and those who don't know who the hell Angels and Airwaves are.  Unfortunately, it appears that most of the population in the world fits into the third, but I undoubtedly, undeniably and proudly fall into the first. Whisper and I-Empire are two of my favorite albums of all time and are in constant rotation on my i-pod and cd player.  I regularly check forums, fan sites and Mod-Life to see what the band is up to.  You can only imagine than that I was seriously looking forward to this documentary which has been talked about for for so long to finally come out.  Today was that day, and I was first in line (ok, so there was no  line) to pick it up (after failing to find it at three other stores first).  I'm not sure what I was looking for in this film, but it was much more than what I got.  Start the Machine is hardly more than any other ""making of the album"" special on VH1 or ""Classic Albums"" DVD that has been released in the past few years. The band is followed from the breakup of Blink (very briefly covered) and through the hype and eventual release of their debut album, We Don't Need To Whisper.  The thing is, during the filming... nothing really seems to happen.  Perhaps the aspect of this film that fans were looking forward to most (obviously aside from some Blink stuff), was Tom's reaction to the way he hyped the record and his addiction to painkillers.  While this stuff is pretty interesting, we don't get to hear too much from the other band members on it.  David tries to have an intervention with an overly annoying and incredibly interruptive Delonge, and Tom himself reflects on that time and how it affected him, but really it's nothing we haven't read in one of the million AVA interviews that have been done in the last year.  The Ryan Sinn exit is brushed over pretty quickly and Matt is barely introduced to the audience.  Unless your a superfan, there is nothing intriguing about this piece of film at all (whereas even a non-fan would find The Pink Floyd Story to be quite engaging).  As far as the extras, the live songs are all from the San Diego show back in 06' that have been widely available on I-Tunes and P2P sites.  The short films are all on YouTube and pretty much on any AVA fan site.All of that being said, the absolute highlight of the DVD is the commentary that the band does over the entire film.  Matt is hilarious and you get to hear that side of Tom that makes you remember why you first started to love him.  The guys are obviously good friends and all seem to be great dudes.  They make fun of each other (in good fun) throughout much of the film and to be honest it is far more entertaining than the actual documentary.  It's the reason I'm giving this the rating its getting.Anyway, bottom line is, if you're a fan you should pick this up... without expecting too much. If you're not a fan, this isn't for you. And if you're trying to get someone into AVA (a constant goal and battle of mine), this is not the best approach.  Adios.",3,After all they hype and wait....,1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,3283,"['Three', 'half', 'starsI', 'have', 'admit', 'documentary', 'something', 'disappointment', 'Let', 'backtrack', 'second', 'be', 'three', 'types', 'music', 'fans', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'who', 'love', 'worship', 'Angels', 'Airwaves', 'who', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'Angels', 'Airwaves', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'hell', 'Angels', 'Airwaves', 'are', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'population', 'world', 'third', 'undoubtedly', 'undeniably', 'proudly', 'fall', 'first', 'Whisper', 'I-Empire', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'albums', 'time', 'are', 'constant', 'rotation', 'i-pod', 'cd', 'player', 'regularly', 'check', 'forums', 'fan', 'sites', 'Mod-Life', 'see', 'what', 'band', 'up', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'was', 'seriously', 'looking', 'forward', 'documentary', 'been', 'talked', 'so', 'long', 'finally', 'come', 'out', 'Today', 'was', 'day', 'was', 'first', 'line', 'ok', 'was', 'line', 'pick', 'up', 'failing', 'find', 'three', 'other', 'stores', 'first', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'got', 'Start', 'Machine', 'hardly', 'more', 'other', 'making', 'album', 'special', 'VH1', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'DVD', 'been', 'released', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'band', 'followed', 'breakup', 'Blink', 'very', 'briefly', 'covered', 'hype', 'eventual', 'release', 'debut', 'album', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Whisper', 'thing', 'filming', 'nothing', 'really', 'happen', 'Perhaps', 'aspect', 'film', 'fans', 'were', 'looking', 'forward', 'most', 'obviously', 'aside', 'Blink', 'stuff', 'was', 'Tom', 'reaction', 'way', 'hyped', 'record', 'addiction', 'painkillers', 'stuff', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hear', 'too', 'much', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'David', 'have', 'intervention', 'overly', 'annoying', 'incredibly', 'interruptive', 'Delonge', 'Tom', 'time', 'how', 'affected', 'really', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'one', 'million', 'AVA', 'interviews', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'last', 'year', 'Ryan', 'Sinn', 'exit', 'brushed', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'Matt', 'barely', 'introduced', 'audience', 'superfan', 'nothing', 'intriguing', 'piece', 'film', 'whereas', 'even', 'non-fan', 'would', 'find', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Story', 'be', 'quite', 'engaging', 'As', 'far', 'extras', 'live', 'songs', 'are', 'San', 'Diego', 'show', 'back', '06', 'have', 'been', 'widely', 'available', 'I-Tunes', 'P2P', 'sites', 'short', 'films', 'are', 'YouTube', 'pretty', 'much', 'AVA', 'fan', 'site.All', 'being', 'said', 'absolute', 'highlight', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'band', 'entire', 'film', 'Matt', 'hilarious', 'get', 'hear', 'side', 'Tom', 'remember', 'why', 'first', 'started', 'love', 'guys', 'are', 'obviously', 'good', 'friends', 'seem', 'be', 'great', 'dudes', 'make', 'fun', 'other', 'good', 'fun', 'much', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'actual', 'documentary', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'rating', 'getting.Anyway', 'bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'fan', 'should', 'pick', 'up', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'trying', 'get', 'someone', 'AVA', 'constant', 'goal', 'battle', 'mine', 'not', 'best', 'approach', 'Adios']",Angels and Airwaves: Start the Machine
1161751,A26O6MQFA36WBK,B00197X1U4,A Reviewer,"[0, 0]","Angels and Airwaves was a really interesting.....idea. I liked We Don't Need to Whisper, but was a bit let down by I-Empire. Not sure why, don't know if it was my growing feeling of resentment towards Tom's attitude and his fake personality in interviews, etc...don't know if it was the fact that it felt more like ""more of the same"" rather than an ambitious continuation....maybe it was the fact that every song was about the SAME DAMN THINGS....but I sort of lost interest in the band after that CD, even though I thought it had some great tracks on it. Still, though, I like the band, and remembered hearing about this film they had planned. And despite this supposedly going to be a ""huge release"" it was released with little fanfare right to DVD and I just happened to see it on a store shelf and picked it up.It's an interesting documentary but never really.....great. This is a very new band, it makes almost no sense to make a documentary about them by this point. Look how long it took Metallica to put out Some Kind of Monster, and they're.... frigging...Metallica. The movie briefly discusses Tom's breakup from Blink, shows the band recording and discussing We Don't Need to Whisper, features Tom talking about his addiction to painkillers, etc. etc. etc. It's all...interesting, but nothing that couldn't have been discussed in a ""revealing interview"" in Spin Magazine; I have no idea why this thing was produced. It just seems to unfortunately further highlight what I've been noticing about this band; they just think way too highly of themselves. A section on the DVD even is called ""Reviews"" and shows pictures of magazine articles that praised the CD....really, guys? Could this DVD be any more one-sided?That said, there is definitely some good stuff on here. 2 of the band's music videos, a commentary with the band and director, a 10-minute explanation of Tom's leaving Blink 182 (wish more of this made the film, instead it's under the special features section,) and the band's CG music videos. I just find it hard, though, to see the point of all this. I like Angels and Airwaves, but to hear Tom call it ""the best stuff he's ever made"" and see him go on about how emotionally powerful this music is....I just can't agree with it, Blink 182's final CD was much more emotionally powerful to me, both lyrically and musically, than anything on the first 2 Angels and Airwaves CD's, hate to say it. They were good CD's but let's not oversell them. And I think that was this band's biggest mistake from the beginning.Start the Machine's a documentary about a decent new band with talented people in it that think a bit too highly of themselves for their own good. Still, though, there's a bit here of interest to fans, and it's genuinely well-made and provided a nice viewing. It highlighted Tom's need to be appreciated as a ""real artist"" other than the jokester he was in Blink, though I wish he'd realize that he doesn't have to abandon who he is in the process. It also explains where the name ""We Don't Need to Whisper"" came from, and a couple (but not enough) live performances and plenty of studio footage. A decent DVD. I think it would have been better, though, as a bonus disc with their 3rd CD, whenever that comes out, because a full documentary release at this point in time just seems a bit premature.",3,An interesting DVD that never quite manages to feel necessary,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,3333,"['Angels', 'Airwaves', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', '..idea', 'liked', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Whisper', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'I-Empire', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'growing', 'feeling', 'resentment', 'towards', 'Tom', 'attitude', 'fake', 'personality', 'interviews', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'fact', 'felt', 'more', 'more', 'same', 'rather', 'ambitious', 'continuation', '.maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'song', 'was', 'SAME', 'DAMN', 'THINGS', '.but', 'sort', 'lost', 'interest', 'band', 'CD', 'even', 'thought', 'had', 'great', 'tracks', 'Still', 'like', 'band', 'remembered', 'hearing', 'film', 'had', 'planned', 'supposedly', 'going', 'be', 'huge', 'release', 'was', 'released', 'little', 'fanfare', 'right', 'DVD', 'just', 'happened', 'see', 'store', 'shelf', 'picked', 'up.It', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'never', 'really', '..great', 'very', 'new', 'band', 'almost', 'sense', 'make', 'documentary', 'point', 'Look', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'Metallica', 'put', 'out', 'Kind', 'Monster', ""'re"", 'frigging', 'Metallica', 'movie', 'briefly', 'Tom', 'breakup', 'Blink', 'band', 'recording', 'discussing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Whisper', 'Tom', 'talking', 'addiction', 'painkillers', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'discussed', 'revealing', 'interview', 'Spin', 'Magazine', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'thing', 'was', 'produced', 'just', 'unfortunately', 'further', 'highlight', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'noticing', 'band', 'just', 'think', 'way', 'too', 'highly', 'section', 'DVD', 'even', 'called', 'Reviews', 'pictures', 'magazine', 'articles', 'praised', 'CD', '.really', 'guys', 'Could', 'DVD', 'be', 'more', 'one-sided', 'said', 'definitely', 'good', 'stuff', 'here', '2', 'band', 'music', 'videos', 'commentary', 'band', 'director', '10-minute', 'explanation', 'Tom', 'leaving', 'Blink', '182', 'wish', 'more', 'made', 'film', 'instead', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'band', 'CG', 'music', 'videos', 'just', 'find', 'hard', 'though', 'see', 'point', 'like', 'Angels', 'Airwaves', 'hear', 'Tom', 'call', 'best', 'stuff', 'ever', 'made', 'see', 'go', 'how', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'music', '.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Blink', '182', 'final', 'CD', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'lyrically', 'musically', 'anything', 'first', '2', 'Angels', 'Airwaves', 'CD', 'hate', 'say', 'were', 'good', 'CD', 'let', 'not', 'oversell', 'think', 'was', 'band', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'beginning.Start', 'Machine', 'documentary', 'decent', 'new', 'band', 'talented', 'people', 'think', 'bit', 'too', 'highly', 'own', 'good', 'Still', 'though', 'bit', 'here', 'interest', 'fans', 'genuinely', 'well-made', 'provided', 'nice', 'viewing', 'highlighted', 'Tom', 'need', 'be', 'appreciated', 'real', 'artist', 'other', 'jokester', 'was', 'Blink', 'wish', ""'d"", 'realize', ""n't"", 'have', 'abandon', 'who', 'process', 'also', 'where', 'name', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Whisper', 'came', 'couple', 'not', 'enough', 'live', 'performances', 'plenty', 'studio', 'footage', 'decent', 'DVD', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'though', 'bonus', 'disc', '3rd', 'CD', 'whenever', 'out', 'full', 'documentary', 'release', 'point', 'time', 'just', 'bit', 'premature']",Angels and Airwaves: Start the Machine
