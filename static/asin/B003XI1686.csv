1370571,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B003XI1686,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[34, 35]","What I think is great about this box set is that it is older episodes that my boys have never seen.  The DVDs are full of episodes from 1999-2006 and each is 35-57 minutes long.  I actually have a five-disc DVD player in our basement and filled it with this box set so when one DVD ends it automatically goes to the next one - yes it's a lot of Barney for me to watch but my boys do love the singing and dancing and what is not to love about a giant purple dinosaur!  Each DVD also focuses on a certain topic like ABCs, numbers, rhyming, schooltime, colors, and counting, so it is great too if your preschooler is learning something specific then you can coordinate with a Barney DVD.  My sons favorite DVD though is the ""Rhyme Time Rhythm"" from this set and it features all the popular Mother Goose rhymes come to life!  All the DVDs really though are great and for the price of this set ($23.99 on Amazon) you can't go wrong for getting six whole DVDs!  This set would be perfect for old or new Barney fans as the episodes are some of the great ones!",5,Over 4 Hrs. of Barney Fun!,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,1052,"['What', 'think', 'great', 'box', 'set', 'older', 'episodes', 'boys', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'DVDs', 'are', 'full', 'episodes', '1999-2006', '35-57', 'minutes', 'long', 'actually', 'have', 'five-disc', 'DVD', 'player', 'basement', 'filled', 'box', 'set', 'so', 'when', 'one', 'DVD', 'automatically', 'next', 'one', 'lot', 'Barney', 'watch', 'boys', 'do', 'love', 'singing', 'dancing', 'what', 'not', 'love', 'giant', 'purple', 'dinosaur', 'DVD', 'also', 'certain', 'topic', 'ABCs', 'numbers', 'rhyming', 'schooltime', 'colors', 'counting', 'great', 'too', 'preschooler', 'learning', 'something', 'specific', 'then', 'can', 'coordinate', 'Barney', 'DVD', 'sons', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'though', 'Rhyme', 'Time', 'Rhythm', 'set', 'popular', 'Mother', 'Goose', 'come', 'life', 'DVDs', 'really', 'are', 'great', 'price', 'set', '23.99', 'Amazon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'getting', 'six', 'whole', 'DVDs', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'old', 'new', 'Barney', 'fans', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'ones']",N/A
1370572,A30LUA3OHSLLBG,B003XI1686,dancarina99,"[0, 0]","I purchased these DVDs for my 5 month old daughter and she LOVES them. She watches them over and over. I have seen many many episodes of Barney as it is my daughter's favorite show so far and I think these are some of the best episodes that I have seen. The only thing that I noticed is that the episodes chosen for this pack use the same songs over and over again but baby doesn't seem to mind. Also a little annoying is that there is only one episode per disc which is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the DVD has a &#34;play continuously&#34; option. Would have been even more annoying if I had to replay manually each time the episode ends. Overall, very cute DVDs for a decent price.",5,Baby LOVES it!,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,691,"['purchased', 'DVDs', '5', 'month', 'old', 'daughter', 'LOVES', 'over', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'many', 'episodes', 'Barney', 'daughter', 'favorite', 'show', 'so', 'far', 'think', 'are', 'best', 'episodes', 'have', 'seen', 'only', 'thing', 'noticed', 'episodes', 'chosen', 'pack', 'same', 'songs', 'over', 'again', 'baby', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'Also', 'little', 'annoying', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'disc', 'somewhat', 'mitigated', 'fact', 'DVD', '34', 'play', 'continuously', '34', 'option', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'annoying', 'had', 'replay', 'manually', 'time', 'episode', 'Overall', 'very', 'cute', 'DVDs', 'decent', 'price']",N/A
