I'm not a huge fan of pretty-boy Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers), yet I liked his character in this movie. I love science fiction, and I would rate this as science fiction ""lite"".  The time travel story was familiar, yet all in all, it was entertaining with strong action and a bit of a twist.  I think this movie had another title at one time because I also find it listed as ""Time Shifters"" in some websites. Like most time-travel stories, time paradox is responsible for much of the story's conflict.  The old idea ""if you go back in time and kill your grandfather, how were you ever born to be able to go back in time to kill him?""  My one gripe (with all time travel movies) is that when the paradox occurs, why are some people aware of it and not others? It doesn't make sense that one could remember more than one time line.

When CVD notices the same man appearing in pictures from 3 different historical disasters, he stumbles across a temporal travel entertainment, whereby tourists from the future use a timeline to visit past disasters. The man in the pictures resembling Max Schreck from FW Murnau's Nosferatu gives the phenomena a gothic touch that is never taken advantage of - as soon as we hear him speak the illusion is broken. When we learn that the current popular attractions all occur within days of CVD's realtime, the always reliable if-you-change-destiny genre is presented. Regrettably the screenplay doesn't demonstrate the depth of intellect that such a genre requires for an audience to empathise with the fate of those involved. CVD is a journalist for the &quot;National Inquisitor&quot; and the momentary concern he has over the parallel beween the timeline tours and contemporary news as entertainment is quickly dismissed. However there is a redemptive twist in the narrative, and a payoff for the running gag of a geek rookie cop who has transfered from MIT. His superior played by Lawrence Dane has nothing to work with except for his authentic gruffness, as opposed to CVD's juvenile gravel tones. Matters aren't helped by the music that never lets up, and Mario Azzopardi's less than inspired direction. He has a fondness for chases and crowd scenes. It's just unfortunate that he has no gift for them, and relies upon generated FX. Logic doesn't appear to be a priority either. A relative is found at the 3rd attempt of looking amongst 11,000 victims covered with blankets, and someone who is capable of destroying a car with a missile gun is stopped by a locked door. When CVD steals someone's car, the owner delivers the camp and superfluous howler &quot;What do you think you're doing?!&quot;, and CVD also gets to deliver an awful reflective speech full of mixed metaphors after he is caught ogling the breasts of his female interest, Jag's Catherine Bell. Martin Sheen has a few video appearances as the leader of the conglomerate, and Theresa Saldana wears an unflatteringly alien cow-slicked hairdo as someone chasing CVD, though I doubt either of them will be listing this film high on their resume of greatest achievements.
