1020435,A2XWMCSWQLT6VS,B000IG7SL0,Alfredo,"[3, 3]","I love the absurdity and biting humor of Bu&ntilde;uel's surrealist films (such as ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" or ""The Exterminating Angel"", to name two). Other, earlier works (like ""The Forgotten Ones"", about juvenile delinquents from a marginal neighborhood in Mexico) are more serious and provide a strong social message.However, I believe it is ""Nazarin"" which most successfully shoots for the heart of the viewer. While it's true that it's brimming with irony, it nevertheless reveals a side of Bu&ntilde;uel that would appear to be intrigued by the solemnity of the spiritual quest. Here, while the director (quite typically) throws countless jabs at the Catholic Church, he also appears to show, surprisingly, a sense of admiration for genuine Christian thought and its practice of selfless love.What?? Luis Bu&ntilde;uel praising a Jesus-like figure?? I always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue... that is, until I watched ""Nazarin"". My appreciation is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following Christ's example in a society infested with meanness, ignorance and sin; but he also presents the hero, Father Nazario, as quite the beacon of light amidst a sea of darkness. Without a doubt, by the end of the film I was looking up to him and not down on him.Some would argue that Father Nazario's doubts regarding his faith point to the loss of his saintly values. (Alas, if he can't do good in this world, who can?) But I would say that this 'flaw', his frustration, precisely makes his character all the more heroic, because it shows how human he is and how challenging his struggle within must be. And who says the priest wouldn't eventually emerge from that 'dark night' and regain his confidence? Perhaps we've only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey.I recognize in Bu&ntilde;uel the aggressive, self-professed atheist endowed with brilliant wit and social awareness; but after having watched ""Nazarin"", I also sense a certain warmth and maturity that's not so evident in his other work.For the sake of contrast, I strongly recommend watching his short film ""Simon of the Desert"" (also made in Mexico, several years later). It deals with a similar subject matter, only it does so in a hysterically funny and totally irreverent style.",5,An essential piece in the Bu&ntilde;uel puzzle,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,2348,"['love', 'absurdity', 'biting', 'humor', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'surrealist', 'films', 'such', 'Discreet', 'Charm', 'Bourgeoisie', 'Exterminating', 'Angel', 'name', 'two', 'Other', 'earlier', 'works', 'Forgotten', 'Ones', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'marginal', 'neighborhood', 'Mexico', 'are', 'more', 'serious', 'provide', 'strong', 'social', 'message.However', 'believe', 'Nazarin', 'most', 'successfully', 'shoots', 'heart', 'viewer', 'true', 'brimming', 'irony', 'nevertheless', 'side', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'intrigued', 'solemnity', 'spiritual', 'quest', 'Here', 'director', 'quite', 'typically', 'countless', 'jabs', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'also', 'show', 'surprisingly', 'sense', 'admiration', 'genuine', 'Christian', 'thought', 'practice', 'selfless', 'Luis', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'praising', 'Jesus-like', 'figure', 'always', 'thought', 'completely', 'cynical', 'artist', 'trace', 'faith', 'human', 'virtue', 'watched', 'Nazarin', 'appreciation', 'satirically', 'difficulty', 'following', 'Christ', 'example', 'society', 'infested', 'meanness', 'ignorance', 'sin', 'also', 'hero', 'Father', 'Nazario', 'quite', 'beacon', 'light', 'amidst', 'sea', 'darkness', 'doubt', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'looking', 'up', 'not', 'down', 'him.Some', 'would', 'argue', 'Father', 'Nazario', 'doubts', 'regarding', 'faith', 'point', 'loss', 'saintly', 'values', 'Alas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'world', 'who', 'can', 'would', 'say', ""'flaw"", 'frustration', 'precisely', 'character', 'more', 'heroic', 'how', 'human', 'how', 'challenging', 'struggle', 'must', 'be', 'who', 'priest', 'would', ""n't"", 'eventually', 'emerge', ""'dark"", 'night', 'regain', 'confidence', 'Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'presented', 'difficult', 'part', 'spiritual', 'journey.I', 'recognize', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'aggressive', 'self-professed', 'atheist', 'endowed', 'brilliant', 'wit', 'social', 'awareness', 'having', 'watched', 'Nazarin', 'also', 'sense', 'certain', 'warmth', 'maturity', 'not', 'so', 'evident', 'other', 'work.For', 'sake', 'contrast', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'short', 'film', 'Simon', 'Desert', 'also', 'made', 'Mexico', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'similar', 'subject', 'matter', 'only', 'so', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'totally', 'irreverent', 'style']",N/A
1020436,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000IG7SL0,Andres C. Salama,"[13, 13]","Spanish director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel career spanned almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. Arguably, his best films were those he made during his exile in Mexico - from the late forties to the early 60s. There he had to deal with very cheap budgets, and work in an industry interested mainly in churning commercial movies to unsophisticated audiences, yet he somehow managed to make interesting, thought provoking movies that have stand the test of time. This movie is based on a novel by Spanish author Benito Perez Galdos - and the adaptation is quite faithful, even if the setting is now early 20th century Mexico instead of early 20th century Spain. The protagonist, Nazarin, is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to the one prescribed by Christ. The question many would ask is whether such endeavor would be possible, without incurring in the hostility, incomprehension and mockery of your fellow human beings. As it happens, he suffers a lot of indignities, yet he remains stubborn (until the controversial final shot) to this objective. I think Bu&ntilde;uel wanted to show Nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps inadvertently, his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) comes out as admirable. In any case, a great film.",4,One of Bu&ntilde;uel's best,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,1270,"['Spanish', 'director', 'Luis', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'career', 'spanned', 'almost', '50', 'years', '1929', '1977', 'Arguably', 'best', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'exile', 'Mexico', 'late', 'forties', 'early', '60s', 'had', 'deal', 'very', 'cheap', 'budgets', 'work', 'industry', 'interested', 'mainly', 'churning', 'commercial', 'movies', 'unsophisticated', 'audiences', 'yet', 'somehow', 'managed', 'make', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movies', 'have', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'Spanish', 'author', 'Benito', 'Perez', 'Galdos', 'adaptation', 'quite', 'faithful', 'even', 'setting', 'now', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Mexico', 'instead', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Spain', 'protagonist', 'Nazarin', 'priest', 'who', 'live', 'life', 'as', 'faithful', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'prescribed', 'Christ', 'question', 'many', 'would', 'ask', 'such', 'endeavor', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'incurring', 'hostility', 'incomprehension', 'mockery', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'lot', 'indignities', 'yet', 'stubborn', 'controversial', 'final', 'shot', 'objective', 'think', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'wanted', 'show', 'Nazarin', 'somewhat', 'ridiculous', 'figure', 'perhaps', 'inadvertently', 'stubbornness', 'least', 'viewer', 'out', 'admirable', 'case', 'great', 'film']",N/A
1020437,A3PHL3OIRNLEGP,B000IG7SL0,Joe Gola,"[0, 0]","First and foremost, this review is for the &#8220;Alter&#8217;s Collection&#8221; edition (the one with &#8220;Vive Mexico&#8221; on the cover), and that edition DOES have English subtitles.Released in 1958, the film is arguably Bu&ntilde;uel's first masterpiece; based on a Galdos novel, it is the story of a Christlike country priest and his interactions with the harsh world around him, with some noticeable similarities to Dostoyevsky&#8217;s The Idiot. That might all sound a bit dreary, but Nazar&iacute;n is anything but; there is a subversive bite to the film even as it paints a portrait of a completely good man (with a great performance by Francisco Rabal, incidentally). Good acts have bad consequences, bad people become likable characters, and everywhere we see the paradoxical and two-faced nature of mankind. This mixture of morality and perversity would be seen again in Viridiana and Simon of the Desert.The picture quality of this particular DVD is fairly good; the print itself is sharp and clear, though there are occasional scratches and other defects in the film. There is also some occasional flicker as well, as though it were not quite mastered properly, but this was very minor and barely noticeable. The sound is poor, however, and the translation in the English subtitles is a bit dubious at times.All in all I was pleased and would recommend it to other fans of Bu&ntilde;uel or foreign film in general.",5,"One of Bu&ntilde;uel&#8217;s Best Films, DVD Not Bad",1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,1433,"['First', 'foremost', 'review', '8220', 'Alter', '8217', 'Collection', '8221', 'edition', 'one', '8220', 'Vive', 'Mexico', '8221', 'cover', 'edition', 'DOES', 'have', 'English', 'subtitles.Released', '1958', 'film', 'arguably', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'first', 'masterpiece', 'based', 'Galdos', 'novel', 'story', 'Christlike', 'country', 'priest', 'interactions', 'harsh', 'world', 'noticeable', 'similarities', 'Dostoyevsky', '8217', 's', 'Idiot', 'might', 'sound', 'bit', 'dreary', 'Nazar', 'iacute', 'anything', 'subversive', 'bite', 'film', 'even', 'portrait', 'completely', 'good', 'man', 'great', 'performance', 'Francisco', 'Rabal', 'incidentally', 'Good', 'acts', 'have', 'bad', 'consequences', 'bad', 'people', 'become', 'likable', 'characters', 'everywhere', 'see', 'paradoxical', 'two-faced', 'nature', 'mankind', 'mixture', 'morality', 'perversity', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'Viridiana', 'Simon', 'Desert.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'particular', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'good', 'print', 'sharp', 'clear', 'are', 'occasional', 'scratches', 'other', 'defects', 'film', 'also', 'occasional', 'flicker', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'mastered', 'properly', 'was', 'very', 'minor', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'sound', 'poor', 'however', 'translation', 'English', 'subtitles', 'bit', 'dubious', 'times.All', 'was', 'pleased', 'would', 'recommend', 'other', 'fans', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'foreign', 'film', 'general']",N/A

1020439,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B000IG7SL0,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[4, 4]","Luis Bu&ntilde;uel`s self-imposed exile in Mexico from 1946-1964 yielded a fruitful harvest, and his films from this period are, arguably, his most organic and economically composed.  The director listed Nazarin, based off the Benito Perez Galdos novel, as a film he felt much affection for, and that affection extended to the character Father Nazario (Francisco Rabal).  Bu&ntilde;uel's paternal attachment to this child/film was sincere enough that when the film failed to win the Prix de l'Office Catholique (Catholic Film Prize), he could express a sense of relief.The saturnine Fr. Nazario lives in a phantasmagoric haze, imagining that he is following the commandment of Christ to ""take up one's cross,"" but only disaster lies in the stations Nazrio visits.  Nazario does not build his house on rock, but on mud.  He keeps company with a menagerie of freaks: beggars, thieves, whores, and a dwarf.  Nazario refrains from bolting his door, despite the fact that his mob plunders his abode daily.  He is relieved of all possessions, save his Sunday best and crucifix.  Thank God for that.  He befriends the suicidal Beatriz (Marga Lopez), whose self destructiveness is birthed from her incessant need for the abusive man who regularly deserts her.Nazario provides shelter to Beatriz' homely prostitute sister, Andara (Rita Macedo) after she is wounded in a knife fight.  Andara has killed her rival and is hiding from local authorities.  The local Church learns of the living arrangement and accuses Nazario of improprieties.  Beatriz and Andara become Nazario's Mary and Martha, but the paradox of the priest's hypocrisy is that he pragmatically shuns Andara's imaginative qualities, labeling it a ""sickness.""  Yet, Bunuel invests this setup with an inviting sense of irony.  Nazario is himself the product of a delusional priestly calling.  Imagining himself to be an imitation of Christ, Nazario projects a disdain for his own welfare that is not self-contempt, but rather the publican advertising his asceticism.In this, Nazario is a bland, literal-minded interpreter of Christ' personality. He is unable to comprehend and assimilate the Jesus' quixotic ""that which is born of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the spirit is spirit,"" synthesized with the value of the messianic claim of gifted joy, abundantly imparted.Nazario's provision of sanctuary for his female disciples results in a house fire.  The loss of asylum and the sanction of the Church catapults the threesome into agnostic stations as they are pursued by the law.  A young village girl is believed to be healed by Nazario, despite the fact that medicine had been administered to the child before Nazario's arrival. The three wayfarers come upon another village, ravaged with the plague.  Nazario seeks to assist a dying woman (in a scene clearly patterned after de Sade's Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man), who refuses the priest's impassioned and persistent offer to administer extremes unction. Rather, her dying desire is for the touch of her husband.  Much to his confusion and exasperation, Nazario's priestly function is rendered impotent.Nazario's offer to join a road crew and work only for food creates a labor dispute which ends with the workers killing their foreman.  Beatriz' mother accuses her daughter of carnal love for the priest.  Hysterical, Beatriz denies it, collapsing in a frenzy.  Of course, her fervent denial masks truth, which she belatedly realizes, rejecting her savior in favor of her abusive boyfriend.Caught and imprisoned, Nazario encounters the two thieves on the side of his symbolic cross.  The unrepentant thief beats him.  The penitent thief confounds Nazario, telling him, ""You are a good man.  I am evil, yet neither of us are of any use to the world.""  The wanderer, freed from prison, is offered a choice in the form of manna.  Nazario's hesitant decision justifies Bunuel's placid sympathy for the impoverished padre.Bu&ntilde;uel once said that if proof of the existence of God was available, then his own approach to art and life would remain unaltered.  Simultaneously, if God were proved a complete myth, the aesthetic qualities of Bu&ntilde;uel's existential letters remain the same.  Bu&ntilde;uel's messages are neither Christian, nor atheist, but a synthesis.  He categorically denies the agendas of the agnostic, the seeker, the devout, and even the Surrealists in Nazarin.There is reason Orson Welles astutely claimed that Bu&ntilde;uel was the most religious of all filmmakers. There is a story (most likely apocryphal--not that it matters), that a male acquaintance ""caught"" the famous atheist philosopher Martin Heidegger genuflecting before an icon.  Called out, Heidegger responded, ""a rationalist like yourself would not understand.""  That quote could serve as a segue into Nazarin.",5,BUNUEL'S EULOGY FOR THE RATIONALISTS,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,4834,"['Luis', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 's', 'self-imposed', 'exile', 'Mexico', '1946-1964', 'yielded', 'fruitful', 'harvest', 'films', 'period', 'are', 'arguably', 'most', 'organic', 'economically', 'composed', 'director', 'listed', 'Nazarin', 'based', 'off', 'Benito', 'Perez', 'Galdos', 'novel', 'film', 'felt', 'much', 'affection', 'affection', 'extended', 'character', 'Father', 'Nazario', 'Francisco', 'Rabal', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'paternal', 'attachment', 'child/film', 'was', 'sincere', 'enough', 'when', 'film', 'failed', 'win', 'Prix', 'de', ""l'Office"", 'Catholique', 'Catholic', 'Film', 'Prize', 'could', 'express', 'sense', 'relief.The', 'saturnine', 'Fr', 'Nazario', 'phantasmagoric', 'haze', 'imagining', 'following', 'commandment', 'Christ', 'take', 'up', 'one', 'cross', 'only', 'disaster', 'stations', 'Nazrio', 'visits', 'Nazario', 'not', 'build', 'house', 'rock', 'mud', 'company', 'menagerie', 'freaks', 'beggars', 'thieves', 'whores', 'dwarf', 'Nazario', 'bolting', 'door', 'fact', 'mob', 'abode', 'daily', 'relieved', 'possessions', 'save', 'Sunday', 'best', 'crucifix', 'Thank', 'God', 'suicidal', 'Beatriz', 'Marga', 'Lopez', 'self', 'destructiveness', 'birthed', 'incessant', 'need', 'abusive', 'man', 'who', 'regularly', 'her.Nazario', 'shelter', 'Beatriz', 'homely', 'prostitute', 'sister', 'Andara', 'Rita', 'Macedo', 'wounded', 'knife', 'fight', 'Andara', 'killed', 'rival', 'hiding', 'local', 'authorities', 'local', 'Church', 'learns', 'living', 'arrangement', 'Nazario', 'improprieties', 'Beatriz', 'Andara', 'become', 'Nazario', 'Mary', 'Martha', 'paradox', 'priest', 'hypocrisy', 'pragmatically', 'Andara', 'imaginative', 'qualities', 'labeling', 'sickness', 'Bunuel', 'setup', 'inviting', 'sense', 'irony', 'Nazario', 'product', 'delusional', 'priestly', 'calling', 'Imagining', 'be', 'imitation', 'Christ', 'Nazario', 'projects', 'disdain', 'own', 'welfare', 'not', 'self-contempt', 'rather', 'publican', 'advertising', 'asceticism.In', 'Nazario', 'bland', 'literal-minded', 'interpreter', 'Christ', 'personality', 'unable', 'comprehend', 'assimilate', 'Jesus', 'quixotic', 'born', 'flesh', 'flesh', 'born', 'spirit', 'spirit', 'synthesized', 'value', 'messianic', 'claim', 'gifted', 'joy', 'abundantly', 'imparted.Nazario', 'provision', 'sanctuary', 'female', 'disciples', 'results', 'house', 'fire', 'loss', 'asylum', 'sanction', 'Church', 'threesome', 'agnostic', 'stations', 'are', 'pursued', 'law', 'young', 'village', 'girl', 'believed', 'be', 'healed', 'Nazario', 'fact', 'medicine', 'had', 'been', 'administered', 'child', 'Nazario', 'arrival', 'three', 'wayfarers', 'come', 'village', 'ravaged', 'plague', 'Nazario', 'assist', 'dying', 'woman', 'scene', 'clearly', 'patterned', 'Sade', 'Dialogue', 'Between', 'Priest', 'Dying', 'Man', 'who', 'priest', 'impassioned', 'persistent', 'offer', 'administer', 'unction', 'Rather', 'dying', 'desire', 'touch', 'husband', 'Much', 'confusion', 'exasperation', 'Nazario', 'priestly', 'function', 'rendered', 'impotent.Nazario', 'offer', 'join', 'road', 'crew', 'work', 'only', 'food', 'labor', 'dispute', 'workers', 'killing', 'foreman', 'Beatriz', 'mother', 'daughter', 'carnal', 'love', 'priest', 'Hysterical', 'Beatriz', 'collapsing', 'frenzy', 'course', 'fervent', 'denial', 'masks', 'truth', 'belatedly', 'rejecting', 'savior', 'favor', 'abusive', 'boyfriend.Caught', 'imprisoned', 'Nazario', 'two', 'thieves', 'side', 'symbolic', 'cross', 'unrepentant', 'thief', 'penitent', 'thief', 'Nazario', 'telling', 'are', 'good', 'man', 'am', 'evil', 'yet', 'are', 'use', 'world', 'wanderer', 'freed', 'prison', 'offered', 'choice', 'form', 'manna', 'Nazario', 'hesitant', 'decision', 'justifies', 'Bunuel', 'placid', 'sympathy', 'impoverished', 'padre.Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'once', 'said', 'proof', 'existence', 'God', 'was', 'available', 'then', 'own', 'approach', 'art', 'life', 'would', 'remain', 'unaltered', 'Simultaneously', 'God', 'were', 'proved', 'complete', 'myth', 'aesthetic', 'qualities', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'existential', 'letters', 'remain', 'same', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'messages', 'are', 'Christian', 'atheist', 'synthesis', 'categorically', 'agendas', 'agnostic', 'seeker', 'devout', 'even', 'Surrealists', 'Nazarin.There', 'reason', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'astutely', 'claimed', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'was', 'most', 'religious', 'filmmakers', 'story', 'most', 'likely', 'apocryphal', 'not', 'male', 'acquaintance', 'caught', 'famous', 'atheist', 'philosopher', 'Martin', 'Heidegger', 'genuflecting', 'icon', 'Called', 'out', 'Heidegger', 'responded', 'rationalist', 'would', 'not', 'understand', 'quote', 'could', 'serve', 'segue', 'Nazarin']",N/A

Even if the dialog goes by faster than you can read it, you can always reverse the DVD to see it. Now that is just the technical improvement of this presentation. The film itself is one of the more exalted in Bunuel's catalog. The story concerns a priest who is so determined to live a Christ like life, he gives almost everything he has away without thinking. He begins to help downtrodden people. In his quest to raise them up, He lowers his own status to that of a criminal . Priests and police look down their nose at the would be Christ as if he were a fool.
