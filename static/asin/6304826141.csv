That's the case with this show.Why it's good:1) There are plenty of funny bits, including times when I laughed right out loud.2) The use of characters who do not have any humor contrast markedly with the one character that is entirely wacko.3) The bizarre lead character is at the same time full of childlike wonder and technical ability (though he hides his abilities well).Why it's not a 5-star show:1) OK, it's an older movie, but the special effects are still quite hokey and simple.2) The characters are fun, but the acting is only marginally good.3) The storyline is extremely predictable.Does this mean that I didn't enjoy it?

""Rocketman"" is such a film. Before I saw this movie, I never really knew that comedy could be so wacky yet so endearing and impossibly hilarious, all at the same time. The incomparable Harland Williams stars as highly eccentric computer-genius Fred Randall, who becomes the last-minute choice of a third crew member on the first mission to Mars. From before the training to the mission itself, Fred manages to turn both NASA and Mars upside down with his hilarious, but always innocent, escapades. Accompanied by his three partners - cocky commander William Overbeck, no-nonsense scientist Julie Ford and pranky chip Ulysses - Fred's adventure to Mars still leaves me in stitches. And this is coming from a man who's seen this movie many times.You won't find humour like this elsewhere, really. As Beau Bridges in the role of Bud Nesbitt rightly states, Fred is both a complete genius and a total fool. When Fred manages to keep his mouth shut (which isn't often), you might find him flying through the corridors of NASA on a runaway chair or conducting a worldwide chorus of ""He's got the Whole World in his Hands"". There's lots of stuff to make you gasp of breath for laughter, and I hate stupid humour - but Rocketman's humour, however wacky and often ridiculous, somehow (don't ask me how) manages to keep its integrity. There is also a lot of clever stuff for the less slapstick-loving viewers.However, the release of this DVD is another one where Disney makes the stupid decision to cut for no apparent reason. The very first scene of the movie, where Fred attempts his own 'landing' as a kid, is all-but cut, making it completely pointless and, what's worse, ruining the mirroring words of Fred as an adult. I don't understand why this cut was made, and for that, I am detracting a star from the score. However, if you want a movie that just gives you pure laughs, then this is the movie to go (even if it is a little historically incorrect).",4,"""It Wasn't Me!""

I was laughing so hard at times that my sides ached.  It's about a man that has been dreaming of space travel since he was a little boy.  He finally has the opportunity to go with the astronaut team.  He must go through astronaut training as well as pass everything to insure that he will be able to function in space.  He's accident proned and tries to turn the attention from himself with his ""It wasn't me"" phrase throughout the movie.While going through space he is locked out of his oxygen chamber, whichhe is supposed to sleep in for several weeks before being awakened to complete the mission.  He does some crazy things to entertain himself until the others awaken.While on the planet he has a flatulence problem (see picture on front of DVD).  This makes for a hilarious time since his suit is attached to a fellow astronaut by a hose.Truly hilarious.  I would highly recommend watching this movie with the whole family.

Randall a computer programmer.  (He's a cross between Pee Wee Herman and Robin Williams.)  His antics have to be seen to be believed.  The plot involves a mishap concerning a manned mission to Mars.  There's a glitch in the computer navigation system and only one man can fix it, Fred Z. Randall.  Naturally, he has to go along on the mission, with devastating results.The reason this movie works is due to the opening sequence of Fred as a boy, it's impossible not to respond to his enthusiasm, which doesn't diminish an iota as he moves into adulthood.  His enthusiasm is infectious.Yes, most of the humor could be considered lowbrow (how sophisticated can a fart joke be?); it's packed with slapstick and pratfalls.  There's nothing witty about the jokes.  Harland Williams resorts to sock puppets at one point!  It's sheer lunacy.  Depending on your point of view and your sense of humor, this will be either a hit or a complete miss.  I've watched it twice so far and each time I couldn't stop laughing.

The most memorable scene for most viewers will probably be the series of tests main character Fred takes to see if he's got what it takes to be part of NASA's mission to Mars. And while the humor after that sequence of scenes isn't nearly as funny, it's still a great watch overall. Then again, that could be the nostalgia talking.As for the DVD itself, it's not exactly the best. For one, you can't skip to different scenes, which is a real drag if you want to skip to certain scenes. Chapter selections are just something that even the most basic of DVDs should have, so it's strange to only see a play option on the main menu. You'll also notice if you check the back of the box that the movie was originally in widescreen, so it's another minus to have to watch the movie, knowing that it's not in the original aspect ratio.But all in all, this was a great purchase, especially since this movie practically never airs on TV now.
