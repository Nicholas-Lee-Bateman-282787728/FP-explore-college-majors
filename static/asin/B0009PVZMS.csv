910680,A27Q80GZDFZ92K,B0009PVZMS,Amateur Stargazer,"[6, 6]","This DVD set features adaptations of three of Dickens' most popular books: David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Great Expectations.  They were shown a few years ago on PBS' Masterpiece Theatre.  Some of the fine actors include Daniel Radcliffe, Sam Smith, Ioan Gruffold, and Charlotte Rampling. They are (for the most part) faithful recreations of the original stories.A possible good alternative to this item would be the Charles Dickens Collections 1 and 2, which contain more programs, but they are on the double-sided DVD's. Those sets are now greatly reduced in price and contain at least one of the dramas in this set (David Copperfield with Daniel Radcliffe). If you already purchased this set and want more adaptations, the dramas in the larger two sets are available separately.  However, this set has excellent quality DVD's with great sound and picture, which may be an advantage since some reviewers of the larger collections found the technology of the programs to be somewhat lacking in quality.You will have to buy A Christmas Carol separately, but there are many movie versions of it available.  The dramas in this set are from  Dickens' three most appealing books besides the story of Scrooge.",4,A good Dickens sampler,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,1210,"['DVD', 'set', 'features', 'adaptations', 'three', 'Dickens', 'most', 'popular', 'books', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'were', 'shown', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'fine', 'actors', 'include', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Sam', 'Smith', 'Ioan', 'Gruffold', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'faithful', 'recreations', 'original', 'stories.A', 'possible', 'good', 'alternative', 'item', 'would', 'be', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Collections', '1', '2', 'contain', 'more', 'programs', 'are', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'now', 'greatly', 'reduced', 'price', 'contain', 'least', 'one', 'dramas', 'set', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'already', 'purchased', 'set', 'want', 'more', 'adaptations', 'dramas', 'larger', 'two', 'sets', 'are', 'available', 'separately', 'However', 'set', 'excellent', 'quality', 'DVD', 'great', 'sound', 'picture', 'may', 'be', 'advantage', 'reviewers', 'larger', 'collections', 'found', 'technology', 'programs', 'be', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'quality.You', 'will', 'have', 'buy', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'separately', 'are', 'many', 'movie', 'versions', 'available', 'dramas', 'set', 'are', 'Dickens', 'three', 'most', 'appealing', 'books', 'story', 'Scrooge']",The Charles Dickens Collection: Volume 1

In my case, three of the six DVDs refused to play on my high end, very expensive Onkio DVD player.  Of those three, one refused to play on my Dell computer.  The remaining reminded me of a joke told to me by a Stanford Ph.D. mathematician-philosopher. The tools of a mathematician are pencil, paper, and waste paper basket.  The tools of a philosopher are paper and pencil.  These stories were originally serials in magazines.  Dickens had to submit so many words on a scheduled basis and did not have a firm ideal of where the story was going.  This is in sharp contrast to Kipling who would take his finished work and make several passes of cutting out whole sentences to compact the story down to a fast paced adventure.  Dickens did not do this when the stories were published in book form.These programs are very long winded.  They could have been easily edited down to 1/2 of their length without losing any of their  content.John Gielgud, in an introduction to an Easton Press book, makes an aside to the effect that the Dickens characters never come across in dramatizations as well as they do in the written novels.  This series is no exception. I think this is because the books have large amounts of first person narrative describing the feelings and expectations of the character.

Haase ""Jo""","[64, 74]","I don't know about Oliver Twist, Great Expectations or Bleak House but I have been waiting a long time for Martin Chuzzlewitt, Our Mutual Friend and Hard Times. Starting with MC: unless you watch alot of Masterpiece Theater you may not recognize any of the actors but that won't hurt the story which is well and clearly told about money, greed, family (relatives near and distant rather than loved ones), kindness, friendship, love and forgiveness. The villians are especially well portrayed - you just have to hate them. I picked up the VHS of OMF on a whim because I like Dickens and was absolutely delighted. The well told themes are similar to MC but without as much of the family connection. Again you're not likely to recognize many of the actors but who cares, the love story is every bit as good as the one in Great Expectations and with far fewer impediments to fulfillment. As for HT - on Masterpiece Theater it was introduced as Dickens Darkest story and it truly is. Don't watch this if you want a happy ending - there isn't one unless it is what happens to the school master's not to wise son and to the girl from the circus. I've never seen BH so have no opinion except I think I remember vaguely that Diana Rigg starred in it. On the whole a collection well worth the money. I haven't actually seen these in their dvd format but have purchase other dvd collections from this source and found the production values to be excellent for picture and sound quality.
