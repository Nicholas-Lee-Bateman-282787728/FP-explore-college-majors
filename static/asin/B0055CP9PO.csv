I was looking forward to sitting in front of my television for all four seasons.  I laughed so hard that my sides hurt for days!  I can't believe I hadn't seen this show before.  The never-before-seen content made the viewing experience even better.  It was nice to see some extra footage that cracked me up.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this DVD for review purposes.

However, if you're checking this Amazon page out, you probably already have seen the show, as it's available for free online. And if you haven't seen the show, just go watch it. It's really free. The whole thing. So go watch it.I'm glad I bought the DVD, because the extras are a lot of fun, and it's a good way to support the project. However, my only gripe is that the video quality is pretty much the same as you get online. So the later episodes that look good online look good here, and the earlier episodes that look like bad online still look bad here. I was hoping said episodes would've been remastered, but unfortunately they haven't. Maybe this is just the highest quality source available, and the raw footage is unavailable, who knows.",4,"Great show, but the video quality is spotty",1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,851,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'David', 'Wain', 'work', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Wainy', 'Days', 'plain', 'simple', 'hilarious', 'However', ""'re"", 'checking', 'Amazon', 'page', 'out', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'available', 'free', 'online', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'just', 'go', 'watch', 'really', 'free', 'whole', 'thing', 'So', 'go', 'watch', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'good', 'way', 'support', 'project', 'However', 'only', 'gripe', 'video', 'quality', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'get', 'online', 'So', 'later', 'episodes', 'look', 'good', 'online', 'look', 'good', 'here', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'look', 'bad', 'online', 'still', 'look', 'bad', 'here', 'was', 'hoping', 'said', 'episodes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'remastered', 'unfortunately', 'have', ""n't"", 'Maybe', 'just', 'highest', 'quality', 'source', 'available', 'raw', 'footage', 'unavailable', 'who']",Wainy Days

Since it was a web series the episodes are all under 10 minutes so it was basically like watching a long movie.
